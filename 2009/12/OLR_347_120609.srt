00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:18,240
Today, December 6, 2009, Steam is about to get some more competition.

2
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:21,080
Could you soon play PSP Minis on your PS3?

3
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:32,880
And the long-lasting video game rumor is revealed to be true this week.

4
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:36,640
Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge

5
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:37,640
Radio.

6
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:41,180
We are that video game talk show dedicated to, of course, video games.

7
00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:44,600
Video gaming, gaming culture, the gamer lifestyle, and food!

8
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:46,180
Lots and lots of food!

9
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:47,180
And crocheting.

10
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:48,260
Nom nom nom.

11
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:49,260
And yarn.

12
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:52,400
I'm doing a third crocheting because I don't have the patience for that stuff.

13
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:53,400
And you've crocheted.

14
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:56,840
By the way, of course, the one and only, Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers, and I'm Rob Roberts.

15
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:57,840
I'm making a hat.

16
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:58,840
And he's Techmaster Loki.

17
00:00:58,840 --> 00:00:59,840
Why not just introduce him too?

18
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:00,840
How you doing, Techmaster Loki?

19
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:01,840
I'm doing fine.

20
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:02,840
Amazing.

21
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:03,840
Okay, so crocheting.

22
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:04,840
I don't have the patience for that.

23
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:05,840
Okay.

24
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:06,840
Just saying.

25
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:10,040
I didn't think I did either, but it's actually fairly therapeutic.

26
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:11,040
Do you, what do you do?

27
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:15,480
Like, because I know a lot of people will watch TV while they crochet or, you know,

28
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:16,480
do whatever.

29
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:19,240
Do you have an activity that you do when you crochet?

30
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:22,640
I sit in front of my computer and chat with Becky.

31
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:24,240
Or whoever else is on.

32
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:25,240
And watch random YouTubers?

33
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:26,240
No.

34
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:29,320
Well, sometimes I'll watch other people crocheting while I crochet.

35
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:33,240
It's sort of like eating food while you're watching Food Network or watching porn while

36
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:34,240
you fuck.

37
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:39,120
Or in my case, watching The Biggest Loser while eating a giant pizza.

38
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:40,120
That's what I like to do.

39
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:41,480
It makes me feel good about myself.

40
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:43,400
Techmaster Loki, how are you doing?

41
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:45,200
How's your week going?

42
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,200
It's okay.

43
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,200
Yeah?

44
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,200
Just okay?

45
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,200
Yeah, it's all right.

46
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,200
I'm sorry to hear it's not awesome.

47
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:53,600
It'd be more awesome if I didn't break a PSP.

48
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:54,600
Uh oh.

49
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:55,600
All right.

50
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:56,600
What happened?

51
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:59,280
So the further adventures of your, for those that heard last week's show, which sadly hasn't

52
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:02,080
hit the podcast, we had an internal issue here.

53
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:05,440
One of the files didn't make it to our server, so we didn't get the podcast up on time.

54
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:07,160
It'll be up very soon.

55
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:11,160
But you've been working on a homebrew PSP machine, right?

56
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:12,160
Yeah.

57
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:15,040
PSP arcade cabinet, I guess.

58
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,640
Sort of bar top cabinet.

59
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:18,080
That looks ghetto.

60
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:20,480
There's pictures of it at orangeonshade.com at the top.

61
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:21,480
It's awesome.

62
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:22,480
No, it's ghetto awesome.

63
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:23,480
Yes.

64
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:26,040
So there's something, I don't know what happened with it.

65
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:31,800
It was something because I had wired up the analog stick to the directional joystick that

66
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:32,800
I had.

67
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:33,800
And there's a way you can do it.

68
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:34,800
It's pretty easy.

69
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:39,960
And the contact points are a lot bigger than trying to solder to the small, really tiny

70
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:45,800
ribbon cable solder points that are for the actual digital directional pad.

71
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:48,880
So I figured, okay, I'll just solder to that.

72
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:51,760
Well, something happened, and I'm not sure what.

73
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:55,400
I thought I bridged something, but apparently that wasn't the case.

74
00:02:55,400 --> 00:03:02,640
And for whatever reason, the PSP seemed like it was only pressing down, and it just consistently

75
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:05,740
held down, down.

76
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:10,640
So that made it hard to kind of select games, play anything, because it would be always

77
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:12,420
pressing down.

78
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:16,360
So I figured, okay, I'm going to look at it and see what I did solder-wise.

79
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:23,400
And I looked at what was supposed to be bridged to enable down to be pressed, and it was impossible

80
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:26,720
for me to have done something to actually cause that.

81
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:31,560
So I actually broke something in there somewhere.

82
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:33,520
Unfortunately I can't fix that.

83
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:40,580
So I'm just going to kind of take a break from it right now, because there's not much

84
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:41,580
I can really do with it.

85
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:44,200
Well it's going to be frustrating that you build this whole machine and then it just

86
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:45,200
oops.

87
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:46,200
Well yeah, it was all ready to go.

88
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:50,720
I had some trouble earlier in the week, I couldn't get it to stay powered on, and that

89
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:56,800
I realized was a mistake because I had hooked up a push button backwards, so it was hooked

90
00:03:56,800 --> 00:04:00,880
to the normally open instead of the normally closed.

91
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:06,840
And that causes it to basically, when the button's not being pressed, the button is

92
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:09,660
pressed, and then when you push the button, the button isn't pressed.

93
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:11,820
So it's kind of backwards.

94
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:16,560
And once I fixed that, it worked just fine, powered up, everything was hunky dory, and

95
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:23,240
then I tested what buttons worked and what didn't, and apparently my R button didn't

96
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:29,160
really work, which I'm guessing is because the solder point was super tiny, so I probably

97
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:34,160
missed it when I was soldering, and my triangle button wasn't working, which I didn't really

98
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:41,600
even get to the point to fix that yet, and then the constantly pressing down thing, which

99
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:44,880
was kind of annoying.

100
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,720
But that's really it.

101
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:52,680
Otherwise, it worked enough for me to try out one of the games and it looked awesome.

102
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:56,660
It sort of worked, it's just not quite everything yet.

103
00:04:56,660 --> 00:05:02,000
But there's a lot of it that's salvageable, and honestly, if I want to try again, I mean,

104
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:08,280
PSPs are dirt cheap, if I look on Craigslist, I can get one sub $50, so if I wanted to do

105
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:09,280
that.

106
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:14,720
And at the same time, I actually figured out a way requiring an extra device to be purchased,

107
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:21,080
but there is a way that's actually super easy to do that, and not only will I be able to

108
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:25,680
use the PSP in the arcade cabinet, it won't actually damage the PSP and I can actually

109
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:32,600
take it out of the arcade cabinet for whatever reason, so I may go that route if I decide

110
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:37,160
I really want to do this, but at the same time, I've got parts for Bartop actually coming,

111
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:42,880
so I don't really, it doesn't matter anyways, because I will have a working Bartop cabinet.

112
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:47,120
I love that you just haven't totally given up, it'll come back stronger, PSP Cabinet

113
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,120
2.0.

114
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,120
Yeah.

115
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,120
Bigger and better.

116
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:53,000
And at the same time, it was kind of a learning experience, because now I know how to solder

117
00:05:53,000 --> 00:06:00,520
slightly better, not enough to where I need to solder these like really small wires onto

118
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:04,160
these contacts, and it was just, it was a mess.

119
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:07,600
It was super delicate, I mean there was so much that could have gone wrong, and a lot

120
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:14,400
of it did, and it was just, it wasn't pretty, so the second time around it'll be a lot better,

121
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:20,040
and a lot cleaner, and should work, but when I actually get around to that, I don't know,

122
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:26,080
because I have a lot of other things I've got to work on, so it will not be forgotten,

123
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:27,640
it will be taken care of at some point.

124
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:31,440
Plus it's just a busy time of year, you know, this isn't the best time to start a big project,

125
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:32,440
so.

126
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:35,220
Well I have other projects, you know, and I tend to start projects when I have other

127
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:40,280
projects going, and don't finish things, and I have my arcade cabinet, you know, the actual

128
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:44,920
arcade cabinet that I've, you know, got everything almost ready for that, I was just working

129
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:50,760
on the front end to, you know, get some of the themes I had for hyperspin the work correctly,

130
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:55,600
and you know, otherwise it's ready to go, so I may just play around with that, actually

131
00:06:55,600 --> 00:07:00,720
enjoy the fruits of my labor, and then later on, you know, tackle this stuff.

132
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:07,000
Actually, I, for whatever reason on an impulse buy, I purchased a, what they call a, a Dingo

133
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:14,920
A320, which, you know, it's not an actual Dingo, but it's a little, um, little small

134
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:20,440
portable emulation device, actually, that you can use to, it actually has built-in emulators

135
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:29,400
for Neo Geo, CPS 1 and 2, NES, Genesis, you name it, and it actually has video out on

136
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:34,840
it and stuff, and I actually have looked at a picture of it taken apart, and I probably

137
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:40,080
could turn that into a cabinet as well, if I wanted to, in place of this, because I could

138
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:47,760
hook up the video out to an old PS1 LCD monitor that I have still, so maybe, but then again,

139
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:51,560
you know, it's pretty nice and I don't want to kind of mess that up, so I'll just probably

140
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:57,160
get another PSP and just do it, I'll fix it this time, but other than that, you know,

141
00:07:57,160 --> 00:08:01,480
um, yeah, that's pretty much what I've been doing, other than, you know, Grand Theft Auto

142
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:02,480
and stuff.

143
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:06,000
Alright, well, I was going to get into gaming weeks, but you pretty much took the cake with

144
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
that one, that's alright.

145
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:11,080
Let's go over to Jamie, how was your gaming week, Dark Sakura?

146
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:15,320
I played, I played World of Warcraft and knitted, or crocheted.

147
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:17,960
Yes, did you crochet while playing World of Warcraft?

148
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:18,960
Yes actually I did.

149
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:19,960
That's talented.

150
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:20,960
Yesterday.

151
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:21,960
Uh huh.

152
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:25,320
I basically, um, because I was doing some stuff on my Night Elf, I just basically go,

153
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:30,240
okay, I'm tired of playing, you know, hide, that, whatever that racial ability is to blend

154
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,240
into shadows.

155
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:32,240
Right.

156
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,240
You know, hide.

157
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:35,200
Okay, I'm done playing.

158
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:37,040
So yeah, that was about what I did.

159
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:38,040
Very cool.

160
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:39,040
Um, let's see.

161
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:42,720
Oh, and watch Dan play Borderlands.

162
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:45,600
I watched a little bit of that, I'm not super familiar with Borderlands, although I've heard

163
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:48,760
a lot of good things about it, and I was watching Dan play a little bit of it as I was walking

164
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:49,760
in tonight.

165
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:54,320
It looks, uh, it looks very comic book- I like the crazy mutant midgets.

166
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,320
Is that what they're actually called?

167
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:58,120
Yes, the crazy mutant midgets or something like that.

168
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,120
Amazing.

169
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:01,560
Um, Loki, was there anything else for your gaming week, I know you're talking about hacks,

170
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:03,080
other games you've been playing?

171
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:05,080
Just Grand Theft Auto.

172
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:06,080
That's pretty much it.

173
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:10,800
I, you know, all the opportunity that I had to play games this weekend, I was just too

174
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,920
busy working on that stupid box cabinet thing.

175
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:14,920
Nice.

176
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:19,460
Um, let's see, my gaming week, uh, two new games, one just a demo, so I can't really

177
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:23,680
tell you about the game, but the demo I played was Bayonetta, and didn't know a whole lot

178
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:27,400
about the game, like I kinda knew it was like a Devil May Cry-ish game with a hot chick

179
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,400
as the main character.

180
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:29,400
That's awesome.

181
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:33,400
I didn't know a whole lot about it, but one of my friends was like, no, you really, really

182
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:37,240
need to play this demo, it's quite astounding, and I was like, okay, I'll check it out, you

183
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:38,240
know, what have I got to lose?

184
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,480
I'm not paying anything for it.

185
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:43,480
So um, went over to his place and saw it on a 360, because you know mine's been broken

186
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:47,320
for a while now, and uh, was blown away.

187
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:48,600
It's amazing.

188
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:51,640
And so I actually sat down to play it, just played it on normal mode, because I was like,

189
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:56,560
should I play it on normal or easy, and normal of course, so played through it, um, a little

190
00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:02,720
bit of button mashing, but fun, way fun, and you know, there is a science to it, and um,

191
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:06,280
you know, you have your punches and your kicks and your jump, but a lot of the game revolves

192
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:10,000
around being able to block at just the right time that will activate what's called the

193
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,360
witch time, where things slow down and get more matrix-y, and then, you know, you can

194
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:19,000
do these finishing moves that are called tortures, where you might push somebody into one of

195
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:25,160
those statues with the spikes in it that'll slam shut on them, or guillotine, but what

196
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:27,840
makes this game great is a couple of things.

197
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:30,440
How amazingly over-the-freaking-top it is.

198
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:37,360
It's obviously extremely violent, blood everywhere, heads rolling, just, you know, extreme violence,

199
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:43,640
and uh, just the little touches make it fabulous, like, for instance, when she will kick a demon

200
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:47,800
into the guillotine, she snaps her fingers for the blades to fall, and little hearts

201
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:50,280
appear above the, um, fingers.

202
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:55,280
Her shadow is an image of a butterfly, which is a symbol that you see throughout the game,

203
00:10:55,280 --> 00:11:01,320
and you know, just all these little, uh, it's so over-the-top, I was laughing and laughing

204
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:05,960
and laughing, and just this move where, like, you spin the controller, like, 360 degrees

205
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:09,380
and hit one of the buttons, and then she'll get on the ground and start, like, her high

206
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:13,600
heels are guns, so she starts shooting from her high heels, and you can actually, like,

207
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:19,260
aim at the monsters, it is insanity, and I loved every minute of it, so I am so excited

208
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:23,160
for the full version of the game, because it was just so over-the-top, and some of the

209
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:28,520
boss fights were extremely silly, I, I can't believe how much I enjoyed this game, because

210
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:33,900
it's not usually the type of game I'm all into, but just the absurdness and over-the-topness

211
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:37,800
and the design of the characters, I can see why now this game is getting all the praise

212
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:38,800
it is.

213
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:41,400
I, I, uh, I, I had a good time.

214
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:43,780
And by the way, did you notice she's wearing her hair?

215
00:11:43,780 --> 00:11:48,120
Her hair is like her weapon, and she turns her hair into demons that will bite the heads

216
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:49,120
off of monsters.

217
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,120
She has witch hair.

218
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:56,640
Which conveniently leaves her with a naked booty, or a thong or something, so, who would

219
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:59,000
win in a fight, Bayonetta or the Baroness?

220
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:03,160
Uh, I, I would have to say, Bayonetta is gonna just kick her into a guillotine and snap her

221
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:07,720
fingers and it's over, so, you know, with, with all due respect to the, the, the Baroness.

222
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:10,960
I guess they're saying, uh, in chat room, uh, Tiger Claw says, Bayonetta looks like

223
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:11,960
the Baroness.

224
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:16,680
And if you want to join us in our chat, chat.orangelauntrader.com, of course, is always the place you can do

225
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:17,680
that.

226
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:22,760
And I really do need to play that game, because I have my, my Japanese 360 now, and I actually

227
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:23,760
do have the game.

228
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:27,360
I just haven't played it yet, because I've been working on crap like, you know.

229
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:31,000
You really need to, you need to play it, and seriously, call me when you do, because I

230
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,480
want to hear your initial impressions before next week's show.

231
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:35,000
You need to bring it over.

232
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,240
Yeah, I, I want to play the full one.

233
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:39,240
Looks like fun.

234
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:44,440
All right, anyhow, um, also my gaming week, um, not a demo, but, uh, a full game, and

235
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:46,240
one I've been intending to play for a while.

236
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:50,360
New Super Mario Brothers Wii, which is a game I played at E3, and I was kind of like, yeah,

237
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:51,360
it's okay.

238
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:55,000
You know, I, I, I played it with one of the nice booth babes there, who was trying to

239
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,440
show me the parts of the game, and obviously I was getting into the multiplayer experience,

240
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:00,460
and I was like, yeah, it's okay.

241
00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:03,600
But I wish that they would go back, and I said this on the show a couple weeks ago,

242
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:09,120
I said, I really want them to go back and make, like, Super Mario Brothers 4, or something

243
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,120
like that.

244
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:15,040
Like, a game like the old Mario Brothers, that kind of, without all this, like, extra

245
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:18,560
frilly stuff that they've kind of done in some of the more recent Mario releases, and

246
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:20,400
3D, and all that stuff.

247
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:24,040
And I have to admit, I was wrong.

248
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:25,160
This is that game.

249
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:26,560
This is the game I wanted.

250
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:31,880
This is the new, it really is the new Super Mario Brothers, with everything that you remember

251
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:35,000
from the old games, with the addition of multiplayer.

252
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,440
And so I totally misjudged this game in the beginning, and I think it's amazing.

253
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:41,120
I have, I had a lot of fun playing this game.

254
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:45,280
I really enjoyed the single-player mode, kind of, it's really just a hybrid.

255
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:49,720
Like, there's so much throwbacks to all the old Mario games, like, it's like, you have

256
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:54,220
a map that reminds you of Mario 3 with the minigames, but then you have Yoshi and a lot

257
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:59,760
of the monsters from, you know, Super Mario World, and then it's just, it's just really

258
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:03,800
interesting kind of how all the Mario games kind of blend together into this.

259
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:07,680
And then on top of that, there's this multiplayer mode, which is kind of, it's really fun.

260
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:10,000
It's a great party game.

261
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:14,920
It's a little bit difficult, because you can really unintentionally kill people and hurt

262
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:19,520
them, and there's no way to really make the difficulty easier.

263
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:24,380
And as I heard Bobby mention on his show, of course, Bobby Blackwell's always on before

264
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:28,580
we are at All Games Radio and we broadcast live on Sunday nights, he was kind of talking

265
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:33,280
about how there wasn't really a tutorial mode, so if you've never played a Mario game before,

266
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:34,560
there's a lot of stuff you miss.

267
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:38,960
And I kind of agree with that, like, if the game has one flaw, it was that I didn't know

268
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:44,400
you could hit the A button to avoid death in multiplayer mode until a little ways into

269
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:45,400
it playing with friends.

270
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:49,540
And I suppose the discovery of it was okay, but yeah, I would have liked, since, you know,

271
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:54,620
this is supposed to be something for everyone, there to be a little more of a basic tutorial

272
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:59,840
mode, but honestly, that's a very minor flaw in what is otherwise a stellar game and just

273
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:03,520
a really fun multiplayer experience with a lot of variety.

274
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:07,440
You know, there's some new suits, like the propeller suit and the penguin suit, and now

275
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:13,400
you have ice balls as well as fireballs, and, you know, they do add a little, some new mechanics

276
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:17,400
with the Wiimote, but it's nothing too crazy or over the top, like you can tilt the Wiimote

277
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:22,160
to tilt some platforms and some levels, and you shake it to do a helicopter type move

278
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:23,680
when you have the propeller suit on.

279
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:29,280
It's nothing too crazy, so I was really happy for this game.

280
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:33,600
Reading some comments from chat, Zappy says, I guess Sky never played Super Mario Brothers

281
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:34,600
on the DS.

282
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:35,600
Actually, that's not true.

283
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:40,560
I did play it on the DS, but you have to kind of go back and remember that I have an extreme

284
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:45,280
bias against handheld games, especially when they are porting over games that I remember

285
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:50,440
from consoles, and I am the first to admit, it's completely irrational and stupid, but

286
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:55,760
I don't like games I remember from my television playing big on my big sound speaker, larger

287
00:15:55,760 --> 00:16:00,040
than life, pushed into a little itty bitty box.

288
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:02,280
I don't really often play portable games.

289
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:06,480
I have a PSP, yes, I have a DS, yes, but I find that most of the time I play it is when

290
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:10,360
I'm on a plane, and I really have literally nothing else I can play.

291
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:14,880
I have this weird bias against portable gaming that is completely irrational and I can't

292
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:18,680
explain, and so for that reason, I think I've never really given Super Mario Brothers DS

293
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:23,160
the credit it deserves, so I'll admit it.

294
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:29,600
Let's see, trying to look for some other questions from chat, let's see, again, if you want to

295
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:34,680
join our chat, chat.orangelaunchradio.com, and I think they're talking about some other

296
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:37,560
games, they're talking about Tekken and stuff in chat right now, which I did not play during

297
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:42,880
my gaming week, but between those couple games and a little bit of other things here and

298
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:47,080
there, you know, not a whole lot of other major games this week, but I really enjoyed

299
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:51,160
Super Mario Brothers Wii, and you know, it's weird because every time, I know we've given

300
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:54,960
Nintendo a hard time on this show, and we've come on here and we've said, you know, Nintendo

301
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:59,940
is so out of touch with gaming, they don't, you know, they're not getting it, and Microsoft

302
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:03,440
and Sony are doing all these things online that are, you know, miles ahead of what the

303
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:08,240
Wii is doing, but then, damn, they always release a game like this that really reminds

304
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:12,960
you, they do know how to do fun, it's just that, unfortunately, it's, you know, you only

305
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:17,320
get a couple of these releases a year that kind of remind you of that fact, so.

306
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:20,800
But I do recommend the game, especially, you know, if you played Mario 1 growing up, if

307
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:24,840
you have that same desire I have, god, I wish they'd make a game like Mario 3 or Mario World

308
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:25,840
again.

309
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:26,840
This is that game.

310
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:29,280
And then there's multiplayer in it to boot that's actually kind of fun, except for the

311
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:32,240
fact that the princess isn't in it, but, you know, she got kidnapped again, what can you

312
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:33,240
do?

313
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:36,640
Of course, they could have, like, kidnapped Daisy, and I don't know, but whatever.

314
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:39,560
All of her guards need to seriously...

315
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:40,560
They need to get fired.

316
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:43,880
No, they need to commit seppuku for their dishonor.

317
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:45,480
Clearly, clearly.

318
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:47,000
And she needs to hire better guards.

319
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:51,840
Let's see, a comment from chat, Ricky Go Max says, I would play that Peach's Quest.

320
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:56,640
You know, there was a game like that on DS, speaking of DS and everything, there was a

321
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:59,160
Princess Peach game, Super Princess Peach, wasn't it called?

322
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:00,160
Yeah.

323
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:01,160
It was different, though.

324
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:02,160
It wasn't really a Mario game.

325
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:06,320
See, that was one of those, like, Nintendo, like, trying to take a Mario thing, and it

326
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:08,680
was okay, but it wasn't Mario Brothers.

327
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:10,280
It was Super PMS.

328
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:12,360
Yeah, she used her emotions.

329
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:14,480
I remember the emotions was a big part of that game.

330
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:15,840
A little silly.

331
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:20,720
So anyhow, let's get into some housekeeping tonight, some housekeeping on Wednesday.

332
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:22,560
We will not be live next week.

333
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:25,560
We will not have a live show next week, and that's completely my fault.

334
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:29,020
I'm going to be out of town next Sunday.

335
00:18:29,020 --> 00:18:33,160
It's really no secret I'm going to see Lady Gaga in concert, and I couldn't be more excited,

336
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:34,840
so sorry, guys.

337
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:36,680
Opportunities like this don't happen every week.

338
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:38,200
So I'm not going to be here live.

339
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,660
I believe we're going to pre-tape.

340
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:42,120
We're still trying to figure out what time we're pre-taping.

341
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:46,560
I have to talk to Loki after the show, see if he's down with Saturday afternoon.

342
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:51,520
And if it works out and it works in the all-game schedule that we could maybe go live when

343
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:57,640
we pre-tape and not have to bump a show to do it, I would love to ask all games if we

344
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:58,640
can go live.

345
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:04,680
So stay tuned to our Twitter and our Facebook, twitter.com slash o-l-r and facebook.com slash

346
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:08,880
Orange Launch Radio, all one word, and of course our website, orangelaunchradio.com,

347
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:11,760
for the details on when that pre-taping will happen.

348
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:15,560
So again, if you are used to coming here Sunday nights and listening, you're still going to

349
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:16,680
get a new show next week.

350
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:18,280
You will hear a new show Sunday night.

351
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:19,820
It just won't be live.

352
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:24,400
And you know, un-live shows are always a bit of a bummer because you don't have the chat

353
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:28,240
room and the phone calls and all that, but we're hoping we'll still have a couple hours

354
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:30,000
of some good hilarity.

355
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
And hopefully we'll get to tape live a little early.

356
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
That would be great.

357
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
So we'll see what happens.

358
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Okay.

359
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,480
Anyhow, let's move into some gaming news.

360
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:39,640
We're only 20 minutes into the show, right?

361
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:41,080
It's about time for some gaming news.

362
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:43,080
Loki, start us off tonight.

363
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:44,080
Yes.

364
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:49,960
So, starting things off, this is kind of interesting, but not too surprising.

365
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:53,960
Games for Windows Live, they've decided to add Games on Demand.

366
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:59,580
You may remember that's a service that's been available right now on Xbox Live as their

367
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:01,680
kind of digital download service.

368
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:05,240
And of course, trying to compete with Steam a little bit, I think, they're going to start

369
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:11,360
doing their Games on Demand service starting the beginning of December 15th.

370
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:18,360
And apparently, some of the games that they're talking about adding for the initial lineup

371
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:24,040
is going to be Resident Evil 5, Red Faction Guerrilla, Battle Station Specific, as well

372
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:35,520
as some Game for Windows Live-enabled versions of World of Goo and Osmose.

373
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:37,840
And I don't know.

374
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:38,840
That's kind of interesting.

375
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:43,160
They haven't really set any prices yet on what the games will cost.

376
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:46,560
Well, I imagine a lot of it's going to be competitively priced or similar to what you

377
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:48,760
see on store shelves.

378
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:52,560
That's pretty much what we've come to expect from Steam, but I think a large reason people

379
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:55,520
really like Steam is that they do sales all the freaking time.

380
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:59,920
And if I remember correctly, I believe isn't Games for Windows Live kind of tied in with

381
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:01,400
Windows 7 a little bit?

382
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:04,360
Because I remember when they were showing us some of the stuff for Windows 7, there

383
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:08,960
was kind of a game marketplace or whatever that you could download, like a bunch of casual

384
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:10,200
stuff, and whatnot.

385
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:13,400
I just upgraded to 7 a week ago.

386
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:18,660
Well, let me put it this way, I've been running it on my laptop, because remember we got the

387
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:22,160
release candidate at E3, like many of you out there on the internet downloaded, so I've

388
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:27,160
been running that on my laptop for some time, ever since I got it in July.

389
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:29,640
And that's what made me decide that I like Windows 7.

390
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:33,720
I like it much more than the jump from XP to Vista, because what I liked about 7 is

391
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:37,840
it takes the best parts of Vista, and what you remember liking about XP, kind of puts

392
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:38,840
it together.

393
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:43,040
The one thing I don't like about 7 is I cannot stand these administrator privileges things.

394
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:45,360
I want to freaking get them removed.

395
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:46,360
It's the one thing I didn't like.

396
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:47,360
It's in Vista too.

397
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:50,280
Yeah, I know, I didn't like it in Vista either.

398
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:51,780
There should be a way I can disable that crap.

399
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:52,780
You can disable it.

400
00:21:52,780 --> 00:21:53,780
Can you?

401
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:57,180
Well, in Vista, all you have to do is make yourself full administrator and then just

402
00:21:57,180 --> 00:22:02,840
do... it took me a while to change it, to find where to change it, but it is there.

403
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:03,840
They should be there.

404
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:06,560
To be fair, I haven't looked hard enough, and I'm sure our chat room is going to light

405
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:09,900
up with comments on things I could be doing better in a minute here, and I'll have to

406
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:13,120
look into that in the next week, but I was just having problems because it was not letting

407
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:16,840
me delete World of Warcraft folders because it said I didn't create them, and I had to

408
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:21,260
go in this really... like I had to right click on the folder, go into properties, make myself

409
00:22:21,260 --> 00:22:22,260
the new owner.

410
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:23,260
It was ridiculous.

411
00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:25,960
I should just be able to hit the delete key and nuke the fucking folder.

412
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:29,220
I should not have to jump hurdles to delete my own goddamn game.

413
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:30,220
You know?

414
00:22:30,220 --> 00:22:31,220
It's stupid.

415
00:22:31,220 --> 00:22:32,220
That's the one drawback.

416
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:34,720
Windows 7.

417
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:37,680
And to be fair, Vista has a lot of that administrator pain in the ass too.

418
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:40,960
So you know what?

419
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:43,880
Just run Linux Mint, Rob.

420
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:45,920
I'm not going to run Linux Mint on a desktop.

421
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:50,640
I'd run it on my laptop, but running that stuff on my desktop, I can't do it.

422
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:53,000
It will run more efficiently?

423
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
On a laptop?

424
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
No!

425
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,000
I can't.

426
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
It runs more efficiently?

427
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,000
Why don't you run it on your desktop then?

428
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,400
Because I actually have to have programs that use a Windows environment.

429
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:02,960
Well, I use a lot of movie makers and stuff like that that's Windows environment.

430
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:05,140
So you know, that's where I'm coming from.

431
00:23:05,140 --> 00:23:09,240
You know, for a laptop though, like, you know, I kind of like...

432
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:11,020
Mint 8's out now.

433
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:14,640
You know, I know you're not a big fan of Google Chrome, but I like where that's headed as

434
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:17,000
far as a laptop OS goes.

435
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:21,920
That it's just the internet, the documents, you know, the stuff you want to do on the

436
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:23,920
go.

437
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:28,560
But I could never, like, God, Google Chrome, I could never run on a desktop.

438
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:29,560
Good lord.

439
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:31,400
I don't think that it's actually meant for desktop use though.

440
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:32,400
I don't think so either.

441
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:36,000
But Mint is fairly versatile.

442
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,800
In fact, actually the other thing that I was going to be doing with my computer when the

443
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:45,560
semester's over is actually doing a second install for Mint 8 because I was going to

444
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:50,920
run some of the Windows-emulated environments because apparently they actually run pretty

445
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:56,020
well using less system resource than Vista or Windows 7 does.

446
00:23:56,020 --> 00:24:00,960
So actually all this 5 gigs of RAM I can actually use it for my graphics programs.

447
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:04,920
You know, I might give it a try.

448
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:08,000
I am not a fan of Windows.

449
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,300
I use it out of necessity.

450
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:13,240
And lately I've been even less of a fan of Mac OS.

451
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:17,520
Yeah, there's things I really, really like about the Mac and there's things I really,

452
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:18,840
really don't like about the Mac.

453
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:19,840
Me too.

454
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:20,840
I know where you're coming from.

455
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:26,160
Well it's one thing that I've actually been pretty happy that finally Adobe has gotten

456
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:33,080
their crap together and made CS4 actually really, really wonderfully compatible with

457
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:34,840
a PC environment.

458
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:37,200
You know, it's got everything optimized for your graphics cards.

459
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:44,080
I can run Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign and Corel Painter and the internet and AIM

460
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:47,560
and all this other crap at the same time without my system just farting.

461
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:48,560
Nice.

462
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:49,560
Alright.

463
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:52,920
And just another quick note because I see a lot of chatters saying that they're hearing

464
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:53,920
a lot of typing.

465
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:57,100
I think something's up with Jamie's mic tonight and it's more sensitive than usual which is

466
00:24:57,100 --> 00:25:00,280
strange because we didn't change any of the dials but you know, things happen when things

467
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:01,340
get shifted around.

468
00:25:01,340 --> 00:25:03,120
So I think it's just ultra-sensitive tonight.

469
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:05,520
And I've been typing on the microphone.

470
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:06,520
No.

471
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:09,560
So I'm just saying, we know you guys are hearing it, we just don't know why.

472
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:14,160
So one of the beauties of live radio is that sometimes we have to figure things out on

473
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:15,160
the fly.

474
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:16,160
It's the whole newsroom vibe, okay?

475
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:17,160
Yes.

476
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:18,160
It's the typewriter.

477
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:21,000
Live for the OLR newsroom.

478
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:25,160
Yeah, we just totally need to have the Morse code ticker going in the background.

479
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:28,000
Goodnight and have a pleasant tomorrow.

480
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:35,240
Anyhow, sorry, going back to games for Windows Live because damn, we got on a whole tangent

481
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:36,240
about Windows 7.

482
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:40,560
The point I was trying to get to earlier, I've been running Windows 7 for months now

483
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:42,120
and I haven't seen it.

484
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:45,520
There was the point I was trying to make seven minutes ago.

485
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:51,320
Anyway, the other thing I wanted to say, though, about this, Loki, I don't think you really

486
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:52,880
use any of this stuff.

487
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:54,440
Do you even have a Steam account?

488
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:55,440
Nope.

489
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:58,160
No, I figured, I figured.

490
00:25:58,160 --> 00:25:59,160
Why would you have a Steam account?

491
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:00,160
Okay.

492
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:01,160
Why would I pay for software?

493
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:02,160
I don't know.

494
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:04,840
Craig, call it supporting developers, maybe?

495
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:05,840
I don't know.

496
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:06,840
Call me crazy.

497
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:08,400
Honestly, I don't play enough PC games to have that.

498
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,400
Fair enough.

499
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:11,520
The last game I bought, er, I didn't even really...

500
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:14,760
Final Fantasy XI is the last PC game I remember you, like, actually playing more than like

501
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:15,760
an hour of.

502
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:18,520
Uh, I played Crysis and Spore.

503
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:19,520
Okay.

504
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:25,360
Spore was, no, actually the last Games for Windows live game that I purchased was Grand

505
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:27,120
Theft Auto IV for the PC.

506
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:28,120
Oh, okay.

507
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:33,400
And I actually stopped playing that because I got tired of trying to monkey with stuff

508
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:42,760
to get it to, it, I don't know why games nowadays, some of them don't support, you know, multiple

509
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:48,400
graphics cards and it's really sad that they don't, cause I wasted all that money on another

510
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:50,920
graphics card for Crysis.

511
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:52,600
I mean, well, it looks good.

512
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:55,040
I told you about my Dragon Age issues, right?

513
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:59,000
Like, it just doesn't run well on my computer at all and I blame the video card, I think

514
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:02,440
my video card just isn't good enough, even though I bought what I thought was a gaming

515
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:03,440
computer.

516
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:06,040
I mean, it wasn't an Alienware or anything like that, which, god no, I'd never buy one

517
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:07,040
of those.

518
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:08,040
But, um...

519
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:09,680
You don't buy computers, you get, you build computers.

520
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:12,480
I, no, I should have built the god damn computer, but it was eight...

521
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:16,320
It was eight hundred dollars and I was like, oh, this is a great deal, it's got like six

522
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:17,320
gigs of RAM, dah, dah, dah.

523
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:18,320
I'm like, I can't build one that cheap.

524
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:19,320
Ah, it was stupid.

525
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:20,320
You can.

526
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:22,680
It was bad judgment, I admit it.

527
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:26,760
How dare I doubt the great and mighty Loki and I paid for it every day of my life.

528
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:29,840
I just built, well, lesson learned.

529
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:37,320
Now, I just built a PC for my mom, actually, it's sadly almost, well, not quite up to spec

530
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:41,640
to what mine is, cause mine was built for gaming, but, um, you know, three fifty.

531
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:46,400
You know, so you, it gets incredibly cheap to do it nowadays and if you actually go piece

532
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:49,880
by piece of what they actually include in there, you can see where they're cutting corners.

533
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:54,120
Well, I need a new video card, because Dragon Age kind of runs like balls on my computer,

534
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:58,120
but then I watched my friend play it on his computer this weekend and it's like, oh, beautiful.

535
00:27:58,120 --> 00:28:02,160
And you can do rotating and things that you can't do on the console, so I'm like, I must

536
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:06,960
play Dragon Age, this game is beautiful, and I can't, cause my video card is balls, cause

537
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:07,960
I didn't trust Loki.

538
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:08,960
Anyhow.

539
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:12,640
Well, that'd be the last time that you'd do that.

540
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:15,440
Well, clearly there's not a lot of good news this week.

541
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:19,320
One of our favorite people in the video game industry, one of our very favorite people,

542
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:24,080
and I don't think Jamie or Loki would disagree with me here, Akira Yamaoka.

543
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:29,360
Akira Yamaoka, of course, the producer of Silent Hill, also for long time Bamani fans,

544
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:32,840
he's been a composer for songs in the series for years and years.

545
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:34,760
He has left Konami.

546
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:38,520
After a sixteen year relationship with Konami, he has left.

547
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:46,000
And no word as to why, of course, but I gotta be honest, without him at Konami, Silent Hill's

548
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,000
dead to me.

549
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:52,320
I mean, I don't see how they could do another Silent Hill game without his soundtracks.

550
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:58,220
They'll probably try, just like they outsourced it, or not outsourced it, but had a US developer

551
00:28:58,220 --> 00:29:01,520
do Homecoming or what have you, and I don't know, maybe that's part of what ticked him

552
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:02,520
off.

553
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:03,520
I have no idea.

554
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:04,520
Or maybe, you know, after sixteen years you want a new job.

555
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:06,760
That he just doesn't get along with people, from what I understand.

556
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:07,760
Really?

557
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:10,920
He was nice, he was nice at E3 that one year we randomly met him.

558
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:15,120
Yeah, he was pretty cool, and I mean, I was like, hahaha!

559
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:23,640
But anyway, but seriously, I just, I, you know, maybe he just got tired of dealing with

560
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:25,440
all the crap going on.

561
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:28,600
And we don't know, we can speculate until the cows come home, but we don't know.

562
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:30,120
There's been no official statement made.

563
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:33,600
But you also look at it and go, okay, he was there for what, sixteen years?

564
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:36,320
I mean, that's a long time to be at any job.

565
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:38,360
And you know, sometimes people just want to change.

566
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:42,440
Maybe he's doing that whole thing where it's like, okay, I've been with this band and now

567
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:44,920
I want to split off and make a solo album.

568
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:48,860
You know, and kind of secretly, that's what I hope happens, is that he goes off and makes

569
00:29:48,860 --> 00:29:53,840
a new studio and maybe makes a new Silent Hill-esque kind of game, because I would be

570
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:58,840
all over that, because Akira Yamoko is a great, great composer, and just, not just the Silent

571
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:03,080
Hill works, but a lot of the stuff he contributed to, BeatMania, 2DX, and DDR over the years

572
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:04,760
was fantastic.

573
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:07,320
And he scored things even all the way back to the 8-bit days.

574
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:11,920
I know he did the Contra game that was on, he did some of Super Contra's soundtrack,

575
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:12,920
I think.

576
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:14,160
He's just done a lot of stuff over the years.

577
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:17,120
I'm sure the wiki has the whole list about that.

578
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:18,840
So, we wish him the best!

579
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:23,840
Good luck to Akira Yamoko, and again, we would really like to see you form a new studio and

580
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:25,000
make some more scary games.

581
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,600
He should hire me.

582
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:27,600
He should.

583
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:28,600
He should.

584
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:29,600
He should hire me, too.

585
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:34,200
I am particularly crazy enough to be able to help with the whole Silent Hill... anyway.

586
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:37,040
You just want to be raped by Pyramid Head.

587
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:38,680
No!

588
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:40,440
No!

589
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:44,360
Not just no, but no!

590
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:45,720
Ew!

591
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:50,200
One does not just ask Pyramid Head to rape them.

592
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:51,200
Besides that, he has-

593
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:52,640
You have to be chosen by Pyramid Head.

594
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:55,720
Besides that, he only bones the monsters.

595
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:57,760
Ah, I see.

596
00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:00,320
I'm not a nurse, sorry.

597
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:04,440
Well, how about some game banning... or not?

598
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:05,440
This is stupid.

599
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:12,320
Um, yeah, so the Australian classification board says that Sega can't have it for aliens

600
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:15,600
versus predators, so that means that they actually cannot sell it in Australia the way

601
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:16,600
it is now.

602
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:24,200
That, um, it's... they're saying that because you've got human beings being tortured and

603
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:32,440
violated and decapitated and dismembered and lots of stabbing through different parts of

604
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:35,440
the body that, um, that no.

605
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:36,620
They said no.

606
00:31:36,620 --> 00:31:42,280
And Sega Australia is like, um, we're gonna still appeal it, because this is kind of stupid.

607
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:45,680
Well, and that's just what you do when your game gets a bad rating.

608
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:49,720
I mean, have we ever heard a game company ever in the history of this show, you know,

609
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:55,520
this is why game gets banned, and the company says, ah, okay, well, you know, these things

610
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:56,520
happen.

611
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:57,520
Well, we tried.

612
00:31:57,520 --> 00:31:58,520
That's right.

613
00:31:58,520 --> 00:31:59,520
Nope, cancel it, you know.

614
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:00,520
Merry Christmas to you now.

615
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:01,520
Oh well.

616
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:02,520
Oh well.

617
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:03,520
Happy Christmas.

618
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:11,120
Well, for example, um, you know, they could edit it, but since Germany had, um, problems

619
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:17,480
with AVP that, um, they actually decided not to release it in Germany, so that they wouldn't

620
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:22,380
have to, uh, compromise the, uh, integrity of the game.

621
00:32:22,380 --> 00:32:24,440
That's a ballsy thing to do.

622
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:25,640
Yeah.

623
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:29,200
You know, one thing I, uh, got to see this week was the Left 4 Dead, you know, it's on

624
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:30,200
YouTube.

625
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:34,600
If you go look for the Left 4 Dead 2, you can look at the censored version in Australia

626
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:39,800
and kind of compare it to the regular one, and, man, you guys in Australia got shafted

627
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:44,040
on Left 4 Dead 2, it's, it's, like, the zombies, like, disappear.

628
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:47,800
Like I was waiting for the bodies to flicker before they disappear like it was Double Dragon

629
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:48,800
or something.

630
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:53,560
I mean, it was, it was not pleasant how desanitized they had to make that game.

631
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:54,560
It's, it's unfortunate.

632
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:55,620
So do you still want to...

633
00:32:55,620 --> 00:32:59,880
It's like, the dingo ate my decapitated, decapitation scenes, you know, it's sad.

634
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:01,440
Do you still want to go over there?

635
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:02,440
What, to Australia?

636
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:03,440
Yeah.

637
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:04,440
Well, I want to go visit.

638
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:05,440
But you don't want to live there.

639
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:08,960
That's because I have an unhealthy obsession with a lot of Australian movies over the years,

640
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:13,440
but, you know, and I want, I want to see somebody play a didgeridoo.

641
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:16,240
Did I tell you I saw someone play a didgeridoo at school?

642
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:18,040
It's not authentic if it's not in Australia.

643
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:19,040
No.

644
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:20,040
But he...

645
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:22,200
Just like if you have a pineapple here, it's not the same as having a pineapple in Hawaii.

646
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:23,200
I'm sorry.

647
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:26,560
But he, he built it out of PVC pipe.

648
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:27,560
That's not a didgeridoo!

649
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:28,560
That's...

650
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:31,720
But it sounded, it sounded right, and the guy was sitting outside at school...

651
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:33,720
That's a PVCeridoo or something.

652
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:34,720
Playing a PV...

653
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:35,720
PVCeridoo.

654
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:36,720
Didgeridoo.

655
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:39,720
I took a picture of it, too.

656
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:41,720
It was funny.

657
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:46,760
Well, look, people, you know what, if this game comes out on PC, which almost all these

658
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:51,040
games do nowadays, what's going to stop them from just importing the PC version of the

659
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:52,040
game?

660
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:54,160
I mean, they don't, do they region lockout PC games?

661
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:56,160
I don't think that's a very easy thing to do.

662
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:57,160
No, you can't.

663
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:58,160
You can't, really.

664
00:33:58,160 --> 00:33:59,160
There is no regions.

665
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:00,160
You can if it runs on a DVD.

666
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:02,480
Oh, I guess that makes sense.

667
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:03,480
But isn't Australia?

668
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:04,480
That's a...

669
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:06,400
Australia's on the same region as Britain, though, right?

670
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:07,400
You can't, no.

671
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:13,240
If it's on DVD, DVD video only has regions, DVD software does not have regions at all.

672
00:34:13,240 --> 00:34:16,240
So there's no way to lockout anything.

673
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:19,880
I guess maybe because we're thinking PS2 would do the region lockouts, but of course that's

674
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:20,880
different.

675
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:21,880
Interesting.

676
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:28,080
Yeah, and even if they did, it would just get bypassed so easy it's not even worth it.

677
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:31,320
Somebody in the chatroom, of course, made the reference to Didgeridoo Techno.

678
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:34,880
I was an inside joke on this show from a year and a half ago, but maybe we'll have to play

679
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:36,320
that on break tonight.

680
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:37,320
It's been a little while.

681
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:38,720
Don't forget the references to Kylie.

682
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:40,120
We haven't had Didgeridoo Techno in a while.

683
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:41,840
You should play some Kylie during the break.

684
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:42,840
We'll see.

685
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:43,840
I have...

686
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:47,560
Well, I had an old school chiptune song all picked out, but we'll see.

687
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:48,560
We'll see.

688
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:51,080
Anyhow, we gotta move on with more news.

689
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:58,120
Sorry Australia, you should write your legislators and tell them they're crap.

690
00:34:58,120 --> 00:34:59,660
I don't really know what else you can do.

691
00:34:59,660 --> 00:35:00,660
These are your elected officials.

692
00:35:00,660 --> 00:35:01,660
There he is.

693
00:35:01,660 --> 00:35:02,660
Someone actually put a...

694
00:35:02,660 --> 00:35:07,400
I swear, someone had to do some hunting to go through my Twitter.

695
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:09,240
Wait, wait, wait.

696
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:13,840
Did somebody dig up the PVC redo and post it in our chatroom?

697
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:16,640
That's the picture that I posted on Twitter.

698
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:17,640
I'm kind of...

699
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:18,640
The OL Army knows how to stop.

700
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:20,900
That I took out of the window of my car.

701
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:23,520
So you see that blue light over there in that building?

702
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:24,920
There's the ARC Art Department.

703
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:25,920
Ew.

704
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:26,920
I wouldn't tell them that.

705
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:27,920
One of these days...

706
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:29,200
Give them money.

707
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:32,680
Tigerclaw's gonna show up there.

708
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:33,680
Just messin'.

709
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:35,680
Alright, sorry Logie.

710
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:36,680
Yes.

711
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:44,560
So there's a rumor that by the end of the year actually, or I guess near future, you're

712
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:50,120
gonna be able to play your PSP minis on your PlayStation 3.

713
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:53,080
So there's basically kind of...

714
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:54,960
I don't know, you can look at it two ways.

715
00:35:54,960 --> 00:36:01,920
One, they're allowing more customers to purchase these PSP minis, which is neat that they would

716
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:04,200
allow you to be able to play it.

717
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:09,200
Two, they don't have very much confidence in the PlayStation Portable platform in order

718
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:13,480
to put out these PSP minis.

719
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:15,900
They are afraid that they're not gonna sell that well.

720
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:19,920
So I don't know, I think it's good that they'll have more content on the PlayStation Network

721
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:25,920
because it's kind of bare sometimes as far as new stuff goes.

722
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:29,480
Now why do you think that the PSP minis are a failure?

723
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:30,480
So far.

724
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:31,480
I guess I shouldn't...

725
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:37,000
Maybe failure is a strong word, but why do you think the PSP minis are not up to expectations

726
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,320
right now?

727
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:44,680
Maybe because the PlayStation Portable, I mean, the PSP goes, I mean, obviously you're

728
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:46,700
all digital.

729
00:36:46,700 --> 00:36:53,120
Most people with PSPs probably aren't really interested in download games, whereas they're

730
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:56,720
more interested in kind of the retail stuff, because that way if they don't like it, they

731
00:36:56,720 --> 00:37:02,760
can send it back, or they can rent it, or they can try it out, and that kind of stuff.

732
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:09,080
And maybe just some of these games like, you know, Tetris they put out there, I mean, who

733
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:10,880
hasn't played Tetris, and really do...

734
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:15,040
Okay, let me, here's one reason why the PSP minis, here's my proof on why the PSP minis

735
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:16,040
is doing well.

736
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:17,480
Here's the game you can play along with at home.

737
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:18,480
You ready?

738
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:19,480
Okay.

739
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:20,480
Quick.

740
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:23,360
Name one PSP minigame that's been released that wasn't Sudoku Tetris.

741
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:24,360
Ready?

742
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:25,360
Go!

743
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:26,360
I don't know!

744
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:27,360
Oh!

745
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:32,240
That's why they're not doing well, because there's nothing of note!

746
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:36,120
I'm sure there are, but I just don't know what they are, and they don't advertise them

747
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:37,360
very well either.

748
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:38,360
Bingo.

749
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:45,800
I've seen more advertisement for the XNA lacrosse game than I have for these PSP minis.

750
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:50,560
I've got to mention this that's come up in our chat, because it's not on the show roll

751
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:53,200
tonight, but it's something I have to bring up, because I really want to hear what Loki

752
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:54,440
has to say to this.

753
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:59,040
SalaciousPopInChat says, there was some sort of Logitech rumor this week about them considering

754
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:03,200
making a UMD add-on for the go.

755
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:04,760
And they already denied it.

756
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:05,760
Have they denied it?

757
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:06,760
Yeah.

758
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:12,080
But let's imagine, let's go to the land of make-believe, okay, with King Friday and everybody

759
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:16,400
for a minute, and imagine that this rumor were true.

760
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:17,400
What would you be saying?

761
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:20,840
That's the most retarded thing I've ever heard.

762
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:27,240
Yes, let me buy a more expensive system that's like almost $100 more expensive than the actual

763
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:32,440
normal system, which includes this peripheral, and then buy an additional peripheral to be

764
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:36,360
able to have the same features as the cheaper system.

765
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:40,120
So you're asking me to spend more money for the system initially, and more money on top

766
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:43,520
of that to buy a feature that should have been in there in the first place.

767
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:45,320
Sure, sign me up.

768
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:46,320
But yes.

769
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:52,240
My reply to that would be, but meow meow this.

770
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:53,600
I see what you did there.

771
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:54,600
Yes, you did.

772
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:56,920
And like half of our listeners aren't even going to get it because they didn't watch

773
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:57,920
Mr. Roger's Neighborhood.

774
00:38:57,920 --> 00:38:58,920
No, plenty more.

775
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:01,720
Not going to understand what you just did, but I laughed very hard.

776
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:02,720
All right.

777
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:03,720
Rob, that was for your benefit.

778
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:04,720
Thank you.

779
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:05,720
I appreciate it.

780
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:06,720
And Rob, I think that's so meow meow stupid.

781
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:09,840
I think this show should simply exist to amuse me.

782
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:10,840
Otherwise what the hell are we doing?

783
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:11,840
Exactly.

784
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:12,840
We're just wasting our goddamn time.

785
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:15,560
We do this show every week so you can bring me coffee.

786
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:24,320
I was hoping that Logitech rumor was true, because it would just be the nice bullet point

787
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:27,040
to the failure of the PSB Go.

788
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:32,320
And there's the ribbon for the package of failure right there.

789
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:36,800
And that's what they should call the add-on, Logitech Package of Failure for the PSB Go.

790
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:41,840
Well, you already spent the money already, so apparently you're going to buy extra crap

791
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:42,840
for it as well.

792
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:43,840
Sure, why not?

793
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:44,840
Meow meow fail.

794
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:49,800
You know what, there's actually, I just realized, there's a UMD movie I have that I do not have

795
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:51,400
on DVD otherwise.

796
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:52,400
Shallon Soccer.

797
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:53,400
No, it's good.

798
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:59,800
I didn't know how to respond to that, what do you want me to say?

799
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:04,680
So that means that I actually would have a reason to have a UMD add-on, except that I

800
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:08,040
have an old PSP and didn't bother buying the damn Go.

801
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:13,800
Or you could just, I don't know, give up on the UMD format as a format for movies, since

802
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:16,400
they've stopped making them anyways.

803
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:22,080
I don't know, I never really saw any reason to, because I already have that on laserdiscs

804
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:23,080
somewhere.

805
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:25,600
And you know what, you know why the PSP Minis suck?

806
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:29,160
It's because they've already had the PSP download games already.

807
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:33,920
There was absolutely no need to add PSP Minis as another form of download game.

808
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:37,040
Well I like the idea of cheaper games, just so we don't have anything of note.

809
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:42,400
Now to be fair, Sony needs time to grow.

810
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:46,400
It's not a chia pet, it doesn't grow in seven days, it's a little more of a redwood tree

811
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:49,320
that takes hundreds of years to grow to its full potential.

812
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:51,540
That's what Sony is right now.

813
00:40:51,540 --> 00:40:55,040
I think in about a year's time we'll have those PSP Minis that are worth it and we'll

814
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:58,000
be liking it a lot more because they're like, ooh, cheap games that are notable.

815
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:02,300
But right now, I got nothing.

816
00:41:02,300 --> 00:41:04,640
You know, there's just nothing very of note.

817
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:11,400
And I do feel bad for the Sony fan, well no I don't, but you know, we habitually bash

818
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:17,520
the PSP Go on this show, but honestly, Sony, it's just time to give the PSP Go an abortion.

819
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:21,600
I realize it's already out of the womb, but just stuff it in the face with a pillow and

820
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:23,340
end the PSP Go.

821
00:41:23,340 --> 00:41:24,760
Because the PSP is a great system.

822
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:30,880
Go back to the 3,000, it's great, PSP is great, it's internet, MP3s, movies, all right there,

823
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:31,880
it's great.

824
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:33,440
Stop it with the Go.

825
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:34,440
Stop it.

826
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:39,480
And it wouldn't have been that hard to, I mean seriously, all they would've had to do

827
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:44,520
is make a PSP 4,000 or whatever and have internal storage built into it.

828
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:51,160
So okay, look, we've got an internal drive and all the same features that you liked before.

829
00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:52,160
And that would've been just fine.

830
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:54,820
Brad from Pop Culture asked an interesting question in chat.

831
00:41:54,820 --> 00:41:58,960
How is the add-on any different than a cart adapter for the GameCube or SNES?

832
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:02,920
Well, in both those cases, you were taking portable systems and putting them on your

833
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:03,960
TV.

834
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:06,080
And I think that was the point of those.

835
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:12,260
Whereas this Logitech adapter is taking something that they took away and putting it back because

836
00:42:12,260 --> 00:42:16,000
you realized it never should've been gone in the first place, if that makes any sense.

837
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,000
I don't know.

838
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,000
It's sort of like...

839
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,000
I think that's the difference to me.

840
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:23,280
And to be fair, those other adapters on the GameCube were a little silly as well, although

841
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:29,680
the Super Game Boy did let you tweak the colors, silly, superficial things that weren't there

842
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:30,680
to begin with.

843
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:33,520
At least something.

844
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:34,520
But at least...

845
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:36,320
I don't know.

846
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:43,360
It's sort of like the HD DVD add-on to the Xbox 360.

847
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:47,640
Something that they could've put in at launch, but they didn't.

848
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:49,840
And no one's missing it now.

849
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:50,840
We'll see.

850
00:42:50,840 --> 00:42:55,240
I mean, maybe, again, in a year's time, we'll be singing a different tune, but I still think

851
00:42:55,240 --> 00:42:56,480
the PSP Go by that time will be...

852
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:58,760
I think if they'd literally put this out...

853
00:42:58,760 --> 00:43:02,080
First off, it would've been Sony putting this out, not Logitech.

854
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:06,360
Although I can see why they do Logitech, so that way they wouldn't look as bad.

855
00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:08,400
It would still be bad enough.

856
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:12,080
And right there, it's just like, oh, look, you don't have confidence in your system.

857
00:43:12,080 --> 00:43:14,560
And how the hell would they manage to hack that?

858
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:20,540
And let's just say, for argument's sake, they were able to, I don't know, make that

859
00:43:20,540 --> 00:43:24,880
device and have it connect to their memory card slot or something like that to read UMDs.

860
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:31,120
It would be hacked in seconds, and it would be a big old back door to the whole PSP Go.

861
00:43:31,120 --> 00:43:38,360
It's not gonna end up pretty for them, which is why they need to do it, so that people

862
00:43:38,360 --> 00:43:40,720
can hack the Go even easier.

863
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:43,240
All right, let's move on, guys.

864
00:43:43,240 --> 00:43:47,520
We gotta keep moving on with the gaming news so we can get to a break here at some point.

865
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:50,360
And we're gonna move on to Xbox Live Arcade, looking at what's going on with Microsoft

866
00:43:50,360 --> 00:43:51,360
a little bit.

867
00:43:51,360 --> 00:43:55,400
It looks like the new game that will be coming out this week, Kix++, because it's coming

868
00:43:55,400 --> 00:44:00,320
out on December 9th in Japan, can't imagine that it would be much further behind here.

869
00:44:00,320 --> 00:44:02,120
If you've never played Kix before, it's pretty cool.

870
00:44:02,120 --> 00:44:06,320
I wanna say Dark Sakura had it as their game of the week once, maybe like a year ago.

871
00:44:06,320 --> 00:44:08,480
I am sure I did, because I love Kix.

872
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:09,480
I do too.

873
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:11,320
It's one of my favorite puzzler games.

874
00:44:11,320 --> 00:44:14,160
And if you haven't played this, well, you've probably played Gals Panic, and it's pretty

875
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:15,480
much the same thing.

876
00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:19,120
But if, for whatever reason, you somehow still have not played either one, then it's like

877
00:44:19,120 --> 00:44:21,460
Miss Nude World 96.

878
00:44:21,460 --> 00:44:25,360
And if you haven't played any of those, you draw these little lines and make boxes, and

879
00:44:25,360 --> 00:44:27,520
you're trying to fill a certain percentage of the screen.

880
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:30,720
I know this game's been cloned several times, you've probably seen something like it.

881
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:34,840
So it's no surprise that a version of this will be coming to Xbox Live Arcade.

882
00:44:34,840 --> 00:44:35,840
I don't know if it...

883
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:39,720
You know, all I've seen of this is a screenshot, so I don't know if it has, like...

884
00:44:39,720 --> 00:44:41,880
Although it looks a little...

885
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:46,480
It looks a little Q Entertainment-y, meaning that it looks like it might have, like, flashing

886
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:48,560
lights and techno music and all that stuff.

887
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:53,480
I have no idea what to expect, but apparently it's coming out December 9th in Japan at 800

888
00:44:53,480 --> 00:44:54,480
Microsoft points.

889
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:56,960
A release here honestly cannot be that far behind.

890
00:44:56,960 --> 00:45:02,280
We might even be getting it at the same time, who knows yet, but most certainly before Christmas.

891
00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:06,600
And I know Jamie's probably all over that, assuming it doesn't suck.

892
00:45:06,600 --> 00:45:07,600
Although it looks like...

893
00:45:07,600 --> 00:45:08,600
It looks like it might be fun.

894
00:45:08,600 --> 00:45:10,000
It looks like it's, like, four players.

895
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:11,700
That could be kind of chaotic.

896
00:45:11,700 --> 00:45:14,400
If four players are going at the grid all at once, that could be interesting.

897
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:15,400
That could be.

898
00:45:15,400 --> 00:45:16,400
To see how...

899
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:19,720
Probably it's a big thing, it probably has, like, online, everybody kind of attacks it

900
00:45:19,720 --> 00:45:20,720
all at once.

901
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:22,880
It could be cool.

902
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:27,600
Well, how about something that we kind of already knew?

903
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:28,600
Hmm.

904
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:29,600
Yeah.

905
00:45:29,600 --> 00:45:34,000
So, you know the rumor was going along for a long time that a lot of the music in Sonic

906
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:38,160
3 had been done by Michael Jackson?

907
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:43,880
Yes, I've heard that rumor before, because the credits music sounds like Stranger in

908
00:45:43,880 --> 00:45:44,880
Moscow, right?

909
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:46,200
And Casino Night from Scream?

910
00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:47,200
Mm-hmm.

911
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:48,200
The same...

912
00:45:48,200 --> 00:45:49,200
Ah, that's right.

913
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:50,200
Yeah.

914
00:45:50,200 --> 00:45:51,200
The little triplet part.

915
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:52,200
But anyway, yeah.

916
00:45:52,200 --> 00:45:56,280
So it was confirmed that he did it, but he was not happy with it, so he wanted himself

917
00:45:56,280 --> 00:45:58,400
uncredited in the music altered.

918
00:45:58,400 --> 00:45:59,400
Mm-hmm.

919
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:03,920
So, but he, of course, kept a lot of the same elements to use in his own music.

920
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:07,360
That's kind of a bummer for Sega, because imagine if they could have marketed that Sonic

921
00:46:07,360 --> 00:46:10,080
3 had a Michael freaking Jackson soundtrack.

922
00:46:10,080 --> 00:46:12,160
I mean, that would have been huge for them.

923
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:17,000
I mean, it's not like Sonic 3 was a little game anyway, but there'd be a lot of people

924
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,760
that would have taken a huge interest in this game, knowing that Michael Jackson had been

925
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:20,760
involved.

926
00:46:20,760 --> 00:46:27,400
But there's also, I actually remembered there being interviews ahead of time that they said

927
00:46:27,400 --> 00:46:33,040
that they were getting Michael Jackson's involvement for the musical direction on one of the games.

928
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:34,040
Mm-hmm.

929
00:46:34,040 --> 00:46:39,560
And, because, I mean, that was in a magazine back when.

930
00:46:39,560 --> 00:46:48,880
But the whole point was that, and this is a quote from, actually an interview with Michael

931
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:54,960
Jackson's composer, Brad Buxer, saying that at the time, this is a quote, at the time

932
00:46:54,960 --> 00:47:01,120
game consoles did not allow optimal sound reproduction, and Michael found it frustrating.

933
00:47:01,120 --> 00:47:04,120
He did not want to be associated with a product that devalued his music.

934
00:47:04,120 --> 00:47:07,640
So what about Moonwalker, huh?

935
00:47:07,640 --> 00:47:11,040
Well, Moonwalker was kind of a rat in the arcades.

936
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:15,480
I mean, at the time, now you look back and you go, this is something better left in my

937
00:47:15,480 --> 00:47:16,480
memory.

938
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:17,480
It came out on Genesis?

939
00:47:17,480 --> 00:47:18,480
That's true.

940
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:21,240
I thought a pretty good rendition of Smooth Criminal.

941
00:47:21,240 --> 00:47:23,200
Now, Salacious Pop was thinking what I was thinking.

942
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:26,000
At least there's always Space Channel 5 with Space Michael, right?

943
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:27,000
Space Channel 5.

944
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:28,000
Mm-hmm.

945
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,080
By the way, have you ever heard this, and I think this is the right YouTube.

946
00:47:30,080 --> 00:47:32,440
I came across this earlier this week when I was reading about the story.

947
00:47:32,440 --> 00:47:34,240
I've actually got one that I can link you.

948
00:47:34,240 --> 00:47:35,240
Do you?

949
00:47:35,240 --> 00:47:36,240
Okay.

950
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:40,280
This is a hybrid one that's actually the credits and Michael Jackson's Stranger in Moscow over

951
00:47:40,280 --> 00:47:41,280
each other.

952
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:42,280
I'll play a little clip of this here.

953
00:47:42,280 --> 00:48:00,160
Yes, I have heard that.

954
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:05,000
By the way, I do think the Sonic 3 credit music is some of the best video game music

955
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:06,000
from that era.

956
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:11,080
So, it is pretty neat to know that Michael Jackson indeed had something to do with that.

957
00:48:11,080 --> 00:48:15,240
So, oh yeah, the Ice Cap Zone thing, huh?

958
00:48:15,240 --> 00:48:16,240
I'm gonna link it to you right now.

959
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:22,000
All right, let's try to get this played here and then we'll move on with another story.

960
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:26,800
In fact, while I load that up, maybe we'll start moving into release dates this week.

961
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:30,560
Loki, why don't you start off with the US releases and then we'll come back to this.

962
00:48:30,560 --> 00:48:33,320
This week's not a lot coming out.

963
00:48:33,320 --> 00:48:39,560
Pretty much your big game's gonna be The Saboteur coming out on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and

964
00:48:39,560 --> 00:48:41,520
PC.

965
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:47,400
Also this week, though, we do have one, I guess, well, apparently now one of the last

966
00:48:47,400 --> 00:48:52,180
Akira Yamaka Silent Hill games, Silent Hill Shattered Memories coming out on the Wii this

967
00:48:52,180 --> 00:48:54,180
week.

968
00:48:54,180 --> 00:48:55,880
I have to pick that up.

969
00:48:55,880 --> 00:48:57,080
I really like that at E3.

970
00:48:57,080 --> 00:48:58,080
I hope it doesn't disappoint.

971
00:48:58,080 --> 00:49:01,040
No, it looks freaking awesome, so, you know.

972
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:03,240
Yeah, well, Nintendogs looked awesome, too.

973
00:49:03,240 --> 00:49:04,240
That's all I'm saying.

974
00:49:04,240 --> 00:49:08,600
Yeah, but Nintendogs was awesome, it's just, unfortunately, we didn't get to play it longer

975
00:49:08,600 --> 00:49:14,400
than five minutes at, you know, E3, so, eh, you know, we thought it was good for longer

976
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:17,680
than five, but, really, it was only good for five.

977
00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:24,840
Of course, this week, Legend of Zelda Spirit Tracks on the DS, and then there's some small

978
00:49:24,840 --> 00:49:27,920
crap that's kind of littering the rest of the week.

979
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:37,600
Wreck Room for the Wii, Puzzler World for the DS, which is a puzzle minigame compilation,

980
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:42,800
James Cameron's Avatar the Game, out on PSP, because I believe it's delayed from the rest

981
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:50,440
of them, and that's about it, actually.

982
00:49:50,440 --> 00:49:54,800
Alright, let me go back to those YouTubes real quick before I get into the Japanese

983
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:55,800
releases.

984
00:49:55,800 --> 00:49:59,840
Maybe, who is it mixed with Ice Cap Zone music?

985
00:49:59,840 --> 00:50:00,840
Yeah.

986
00:50:00,840 --> 00:50:05,040
Oops, I still have my wave muted.

987
00:50:05,040 --> 00:50:07,040
Live radio fail.

988
00:50:07,040 --> 00:50:20,440
Something's out of tune with that.

989
00:50:20,440 --> 00:50:22,160
I think they were just doing it to sync it.

990
00:50:22,160 --> 00:50:24,120
They need Timbaland to get it auto-tuned.

991
00:50:24,120 --> 00:50:25,560
That's what they need, and then it would be fine.

992
00:50:25,560 --> 00:50:27,000
They were syncing it.

993
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:28,000
That's the whole thing.

994
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:29,000
I get it.

995
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:30,000
Alright.

996
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:31,000
I know it was jam, not scream.

997
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:36,000
Jam mixed with Carnival Night Zone.

998
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:47,480
Dude, I like this.

999
00:50:47,480 --> 00:50:50,920
It's kind of neat.

1000
00:50:50,920 --> 00:50:53,880
It's so cool now that that game just has so much added value.

1001
00:50:53,880 --> 00:50:56,680
Even though this is one of those things everybody always suspected anyway, but I think a lot

1002
00:50:56,680 --> 00:51:00,840
of people were like, did Michael Jackson rip off Sonic because it was one of his favorite

1003
00:51:00,840 --> 00:51:01,840
movies?

1004
00:51:01,840 --> 00:51:02,840
But now it's like, no.

1005
00:51:02,840 --> 00:51:03,840
He fucking wrote it.

1006
00:51:03,840 --> 00:51:05,920
He just took the stuff he already did.

1007
00:51:05,920 --> 00:51:06,920
Yeah.

1008
00:51:06,920 --> 00:51:07,920
I think it's amazing.

1009
00:51:07,920 --> 00:51:11,360
A couple more things I was going to mention real quick for release dates, even though

1010
00:51:11,360 --> 00:51:16,520
it's not next week, but there's a couple of the Konami Classic volumes that are coming

1011
00:51:16,520 --> 00:51:22,840
out on Xbox 360 for 20 bucks each, and actually there's a couple that are pretty good deals.

1012
00:51:22,840 --> 00:51:26,240
The first one is... Are these just like the live arcade games?

1013
00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:27,240
These are live arcade games.

1014
00:51:27,240 --> 00:51:28,240
Like what PopCap does.

1015
00:51:28,240 --> 00:51:29,240
That's pretty sweet.

1016
00:51:29,240 --> 00:51:32,880
They've got Castlevania, Symphony of the Night, Frogger, and Super Contra.

1017
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:33,880
That's for 20 bucks.

1018
00:51:33,880 --> 00:51:39,760
The other one that they have is Track and Field, Rush and Attack, and Contra.

1019
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:42,560
Rush and Attack, by the way, I bet is one of those arcade games you probably didn't

1020
00:51:42,560 --> 00:51:43,560
play growing up.

1021
00:51:43,560 --> 00:51:46,900
At least I didn't, but it was actually a lot of fun on Xbox Live Arcade.

1022
00:51:46,900 --> 00:51:47,900
For five bucks.

1023
00:51:47,900 --> 00:51:48,900
It wasn't a bad deal.

1024
00:51:48,900 --> 00:51:49,900
Anyhow.

1025
00:51:49,900 --> 00:51:51,080
So that's what they're available for now.

1026
00:51:51,080 --> 00:51:54,680
I'm not sure if they've dropped the price enough to where that's actually not a good

1027
00:51:54,680 --> 00:51:57,800
deal anymore, but maybe three games for 20 bucks.

1028
00:51:57,800 --> 00:52:00,040
Let's go to Japan and look at the releases over there.

1029
00:52:00,040 --> 00:52:03,280
Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 gets released in Japan this week, obviously.

1030
00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:06,320
Not quite as big of a deal there as it was here, but certainly the game is going to have

1031
00:52:06,320 --> 00:52:08,360
its fans over there, just like it does here.

1032
00:52:08,360 --> 00:52:12,040
That is coming out on the Xbox 360 this week in Japan, and they're even getting their own

1033
00:52:12,040 --> 00:52:15,800
Xbox 360 Elite version of it, just like we had here.

1034
00:52:15,800 --> 00:52:18,600
Samurai Spirits Zen comes out on the 360 as well.

1035
00:52:18,600 --> 00:52:22,600
If I'm not mistaken, Samurai Spirits is Samurai Shodown over here, correct?

1036
00:52:22,600 --> 00:52:26,960
So yeah, it's from SNK, so that is getting released on the 360 this week.

1037
00:52:26,960 --> 00:52:29,280
Some fighting game fans are going to be very happy about that.

1038
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:32,060
I know that series has its fans.

1039
00:52:32,060 --> 00:52:37,760
Also on PlayStation 3, Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 is out over there as well, as well

1040
00:52:37,760 --> 00:52:40,800
as X-Edge or Cross Edge.

1041
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:45,320
Of course, next week is Final Fantasy 13, and I know a lot of you over here in America

1042
00:52:45,320 --> 00:52:48,600
are going to be importing that, although if you just wait 4 more months, you'll have it

1043
00:52:48,600 --> 00:52:50,240
here soon enough.

1044
00:52:50,240 --> 00:52:55,600
Coming out on the Nintendo Wii, Tales of Graces, and it's also, I guess, a big enough game

1045
00:52:55,600 --> 00:53:00,820
where it's getting a bundle release as well, because it's a Tales of game, but now it's

1046
00:53:00,820 --> 00:53:01,820
on the Wii.

1047
00:53:01,820 --> 00:53:04,840
Like, you know, Tales of Symphonia and all these other titles, now it's Tales of Graces

1048
00:53:04,840 --> 00:53:06,800
coming out on the Wii this week in Japan.

1049
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:10,760
Also Toushinden coming out in Japan this week as well.

1050
00:53:10,760 --> 00:53:11,760
On the Nintendo Wii.

1051
00:53:11,760 --> 00:53:12,760
No way.

1052
00:53:12,760 --> 00:53:13,760
Way.

1053
00:53:13,760 --> 00:53:18,840
Man, I remember playing Toushinden 3 on PlayStation.

1054
00:53:18,840 --> 00:53:19,840
There it is.

1055
00:53:19,840 --> 00:53:20,840
Now you get a version on the Nintendo Wii.

1056
00:53:20,840 --> 00:53:23,200
I don't know if it's a ported version of the game or what it is.

1057
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:24,200
Oh no, it's a redo.

1058
00:53:24,200 --> 00:53:27,320
Actually, you know, I remembered seeing the trailer for it.

1059
00:53:27,320 --> 00:53:28,320
Yeah?

1060
00:53:28,320 --> 00:53:29,960
Yeah, and it looked just as crappy as all the other ones, which means I have to play

1061
00:53:29,960 --> 00:53:30,960
it.

1062
00:53:30,960 --> 00:53:34,520
Um, PlayStation 2, you know, the releases are dying down over there in Japan just like

1063
00:53:34,520 --> 00:53:38,520
they are over here, but I do want to point out World Soccer winning 11 2010 is coming

1064
00:53:38,520 --> 00:53:40,680
out in Japan for you soccer fans.

1065
00:53:40,680 --> 00:53:48,560
Nintendo DS, Luminous Arc 3 comes out on the DS this week, and lastly on the PSP, Bleach

1066
00:53:48,560 --> 00:53:54,600
Soul Carnival 2 makes its way out in Japan as well as yet another Naruto game, Naruto

1067
00:53:54,600 --> 00:53:59,200
Shippuden Narutamit Excel 3.

1068
00:53:59,200 --> 00:54:00,200
And World Soccer winning 11.

1069
00:54:00,200 --> 00:54:01,200
Woohoo.

1070
00:54:01,200 --> 00:54:02,200
On PSP.

1071
00:54:02,200 --> 00:54:03,680
There you have it for Japanese releases.

1072
00:54:03,680 --> 00:54:08,000
Well, we've got just a few notable ones for the UK.

1073
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:13,920
On the 10th, Pixel Junk Shooter on PlayStation 3, and then on the 11th we have Tekken 6 on

1074
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:18,720
PSP and The Legend of Zelda Spirit Tracks on DS.

1075
00:54:18,720 --> 00:54:19,720
Very cool.

1076
00:54:19,720 --> 00:54:24,680
All right, so, back to some more gaming news then, and then we're going to get into the

1077
00:54:24,680 --> 00:54:28,400
Classic Game of the Week before too long here, and of course our Part B in just a little

1078
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:29,400
while.

1079
00:54:29,400 --> 00:54:30,400
Mm-hmm.

1080
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:33,480
Um, this is kind of cool.

1081
00:54:33,480 --> 00:54:39,560
They've got, you may remember we talked a little bit about this before, kind of the

1082
00:54:39,560 --> 00:54:45,760
whole play, create, share games that they've got now on the PlayStation 3.

1083
00:54:45,760 --> 00:54:50,760
Well, the second one in the series is ModNation Racers, and of course it's kind of like Build

1084
00:54:50,760 --> 00:54:56,600
Your Own Mario Kart type game, but they are, just like they did with LittleBigPlanet, they're

1085
00:54:56,600 --> 00:55:01,600
going to be having a beta, and it actually starts this month, and there's a few ways

1086
00:55:01,600 --> 00:55:03,660
you could be in that beta.

1087
00:55:03,660 --> 00:55:06,680
One is of course if you bought- Blowing someone at Sony.

1088
00:55:06,680 --> 00:55:07,680
That's one way you can do it.

1089
00:55:07,680 --> 00:55:09,360
That might, that might work.

1090
00:55:09,360 --> 00:55:12,720
One is if you bought the LittleBigPlanet Game of the Year Edition, which have a code that

1091
00:55:12,720 --> 00:55:19,120
came inside the box, and then of course you can also sign up online for a chance to participate

1092
00:55:19,120 --> 00:55:26,500
as well, and that of course can be done at us.playstation.com slash ModNation slash online

1093
00:55:26,500 --> 00:55:31,240
beta, and you can go ahead and sign up there.

1094
00:55:31,240 --> 00:55:37,000
Also you can be an existing subscriber to CORE, or subscribe on or before December 15th,

1095
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:43,840
receive a voucher as well, and you can check out the pretty awesome game, which still no

1096
00:55:43,840 --> 00:55:48,580
one has announced that it's going to be on PSP, but it is going to be on PSP.

1097
00:55:48,580 --> 00:55:50,360
You heard it here first.

1098
00:55:50,360 --> 00:55:53,840
Well, it also doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure that out.

1099
00:55:53,840 --> 00:55:54,840
Of course.

1100
00:55:54,840 --> 00:56:00,080
I mean, to be fair, but it would be nice to have that confirmed by Sony at some point,

1101
00:56:00,080 --> 00:56:03,240
but you know, someday they'll decide to say it, and it'll be a big surprise, except not

1102
00:56:03,240 --> 00:56:04,240
really.

1103
00:56:04,240 --> 00:56:06,040
But I'm actually very much looking forward to ModNation's Racer.

1104
00:56:06,040 --> 00:56:10,240
I think this does look like another game that's going to be like a must-have on the PS3, so

1105
00:56:10,240 --> 00:56:13,960
I'm very excited to see that.

1106
00:56:13,960 --> 00:56:14,960
So we'll see.

1107
00:56:14,960 --> 00:56:15,960
Yeah.

1108
00:56:15,960 --> 00:56:16,960
I was just reading in chat.

1109
00:56:16,960 --> 00:56:17,960
What's that?

1110
00:56:17,960 --> 00:56:23,000
Bond 006 said, I think the gay marriage bill was just passed here in New York.

1111
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:24,000
On a Sunday night?

1112
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:25,000
Well, I...

1113
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:26,000
Well, checking the news.

1114
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:33,200
Yeah, I was going to say, careful, there was one that failed a couple days ago in the New

1115
00:56:33,200 --> 00:56:37,000
York Senate, I think it was.

1116
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:38,000
So...

1117
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:39,000
Let us know as you find out.

1118
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:40,000
Yeah.

1119
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:41,000
I'd be curious, too.

1120
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:43,000
You know, it'll be about time.

1121
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:46,000
I mean, live in the now, people.

1122
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:47,000
Yeah.

1123
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:48,000
All right.

1124
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:54,000
Also, coming to the now, which I'm very excited about, Sunsoft, rise from your grave.

1125
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:58,080
Okay, I mean, that wasn't a Sunsoft game, but still, you might remember Sunsoft.

1126
00:56:58,080 --> 00:57:02,160
They made some cool 8-bit games back in the day, one of which, of course, near and dear

1127
00:57:02,160 --> 00:57:04,320
to all of our hearts, Fester's Quest.

1128
00:57:04,320 --> 00:57:05,640
No, I'm kidding.

1129
00:57:05,640 --> 00:57:06,640
Blaster Master.

1130
00:57:06,640 --> 00:57:08,120
Well, Fester's Quest wasn't that bad.

1131
00:57:08,120 --> 00:57:09,880
But Blaster Master was made by Sunsoft.

1132
00:57:09,880 --> 00:57:11,560
Yeah, it wasn't that bad.

1133
00:57:11,560 --> 00:57:13,480
For me to poop on.

1134
00:57:13,480 --> 00:57:18,200
Hey, I got that game for Christmas, one Christmas, and I played it for like a week straight.

1135
00:57:18,200 --> 00:57:20,200
It wasn't terrible, except it was very strange.

1136
00:57:20,200 --> 00:57:24,560
Like, aliens land in the Addams Family back, forget it.

1137
00:57:24,560 --> 00:57:26,280
Blaster Master, fuck everything else.

1138
00:57:26,280 --> 00:57:27,720
You have Blaster Master.

1139
00:57:27,720 --> 00:57:29,280
Who cares what else Sunsoft did?

1140
00:57:29,280 --> 00:57:31,060
They did Blaster Master.

1141
00:57:31,060 --> 00:57:35,160
And sure enough, that is the first thing they are planning to release now on the NES Virtual

1142
00:57:35,160 --> 00:57:37,600
Console, is Blaster Master.

1143
00:57:37,600 --> 00:57:42,000
Unfortunately, it's not like a WiiWare souped-up version or anything like that, but the Wii

1144
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:46,480
Virtual Console release of Blaster Master, 500 Wii points, apparently coming out this

1145
00:57:46,480 --> 00:57:47,840
month.

1146
00:57:47,840 --> 00:57:51,680
By the way, the whole reason this is happening is because Sunsoft is actually resuming operations

1147
00:57:51,680 --> 00:57:52,680
in North America.

1148
00:57:52,680 --> 00:57:55,960
They're having a little help from a company called Gaijin Works.

1149
00:57:55,960 --> 00:57:59,260
And Gaijin Works made Miami Law for the Nintendo DS.

1150
00:57:59,260 --> 00:58:02,240
It was part of Working Designs.

1151
00:58:02,240 --> 00:58:05,320
Victor Ireland left them and kind of made this, and so forth.

1152
00:58:05,320 --> 00:58:08,760
When Working Designs closed, da-da-da-da-da, one thing led to another.

1153
00:58:08,760 --> 00:58:11,600
So now we have Sunsoft.

1154
00:58:11,600 --> 00:58:17,280
Quote coming from Ireland, in the, Victor Ireland, that is, in the official announcement.

1155
00:58:17,280 --> 00:58:21,120
The first Wii release is a great start, but there is one upcoming announcement in particular

1156
00:58:21,120 --> 00:58:26,320
that will demonstrate just how serious Yoshida-san is about rebuilding the Sunsoft console gaming

1157
00:58:26,320 --> 00:58:27,520
brand here.

1158
00:58:27,520 --> 00:58:29,640
Game fans are going to be pretty happy when they hear about it.

1159
00:58:29,640 --> 00:58:31,520
I know I was.

1160
00:58:31,520 --> 00:58:33,440
So I'm kind of curious, what other big games did Sunsoft do?

1161
00:58:33,440 --> 00:58:36,840
I'm trying to think what their other big franchises were, because I know they had more than that.

1162
00:58:36,840 --> 00:58:38,400
Did you say Victor Ireland?

1163
00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:39,400
Yes, from Working Designs.

1164
00:58:39,400 --> 00:58:40,400
From Working Designs.

1165
00:58:40,400 --> 00:58:41,400
Yeah.

1166
00:58:41,400 --> 00:58:42,400
We have his Twilight Zone.

1167
00:58:42,400 --> 00:58:43,400
Really?

1168
00:58:43,400 --> 00:58:44,400
Yes.

1169
00:58:44,400 --> 00:58:47,200
Well, he's the guy you can thank for bringing Sunsoft back to life.

1170
00:58:47,200 --> 00:58:48,200
Thank you.

1171
00:58:48,200 --> 00:58:49,200
And thank you for your pinball table.

1172
00:58:49,200 --> 00:58:51,800
Wait, do you have his contact information then?

1173
00:58:51,800 --> 00:58:53,520
Dan might.

1174
00:58:53,520 --> 00:58:55,200
Could we get him on the show possibly, maybe?

1175
00:58:55,200 --> 00:58:56,200
That would be kind of nice.

1176
00:58:56,200 --> 00:58:57,200
Let me see if Dan still has it.

1177
00:58:57,200 --> 00:58:58,200
Yeah, try to make that happen.

1178
00:58:58,200 --> 00:59:01,560
But no, Dan actually bought his Twilight Zone.

1179
00:59:01,560 --> 00:59:06,240
And so he gave us, you know that Goemon doll that I have?

1180
00:59:06,240 --> 00:59:08,880
He gave us a Goemon doll, because they had a whole bunch of them, because they were supposed

1181
00:59:08,880 --> 00:59:12,880
to be for pre-ordering the Goemon game that they never brought out.

1182
00:59:12,880 --> 00:59:17,320
Let's see, here's some of the other big things that Sunsoft did.

1183
00:59:17,320 --> 00:59:19,240
Arrow the Acrobat.

1184
00:59:19,240 --> 00:59:21,280
They did the Blaster Master series, of course.

1185
00:59:21,280 --> 00:59:24,640
They did some of the Batman games, like the original Batman on the NES, which was not

1186
00:59:24,640 --> 00:59:25,640
too bad.

1187
00:59:25,640 --> 00:59:30,040
Let's see, they did Fester's Quest, of course.

1188
00:59:30,040 --> 00:59:34,980
Some of the Final Fantasy Legend, I guess, games were translated by them, or localized

1189
00:59:34,980 --> 00:59:37,560
or whatever you want to say by them.

1190
00:59:37,560 --> 00:59:40,520
Freedom Force, lol.

1191
00:59:40,520 --> 00:59:41,600
Lemmings on the NES.

1192
00:59:41,600 --> 00:59:44,680
They did a lot of NES ports of games that were big on other systems.

1193
00:59:44,680 --> 00:59:48,920
Like Fantasy Zone on the NES was Sunsoft.

1194
00:59:48,920 --> 00:59:50,640
You remember how they had like a version of that?

1195
00:59:50,640 --> 00:59:52,520
That was done by Sunsoft.

1196
00:59:52,520 --> 00:59:55,040
So hmm, very interesting.

1197
00:59:55,040 --> 00:59:59,680
Spy Hunter on the NES was them, as well as Super Spy Hunter.

1198
00:59:59,680 --> 01:00:03,480
I'd be very curious to see what they have planned.

1199
01:00:03,480 --> 01:00:04,480
We'll see.

1200
01:00:04,480 --> 01:00:08,280
Hope, I would love for some type of like sequel to Blaster Master, because clearly that's

1201
01:00:08,280 --> 01:00:12,080
their huge, huge franchise, and something better than the one that was on Genesis, because

1202
01:00:12,080 --> 01:00:15,400
the one that was on Genesis, not so great.

1203
01:00:15,400 --> 01:00:18,520
Anyhow, speaking of stuff worthy of the Virtual Console, we're going to take a trip down

1204
01:00:18,520 --> 01:00:24,220
memory lane in a segment we like to call the Classic Game of the Week.

1205
01:00:24,220 --> 01:00:27,640
And every week in the Classic Video Game of the Week segment, Dark Sakura takes a trip

1206
01:00:27,640 --> 01:00:32,480
to the video game vault and pulls out a game that she thinks, dammit, you ought to be playing

1207
01:00:32,480 --> 01:00:33,480
this game.

1208
01:00:33,480 --> 01:00:39,520
Super Snappers, you need to dust off your NES, or SNES, or as in the case of a lot of

1209
01:00:39,520 --> 01:00:43,520
these games, Sega related systems, and play this game.

1210
01:00:43,520 --> 01:00:46,360
So Dark Sakura, what is the Classic Game of the Week?

1211
01:00:46,360 --> 01:00:47,360
Final Fight!

1212
01:00:47,360 --> 01:00:49,920
Ah, a topically inspired game, I see.

1213
01:00:49,920 --> 01:00:50,920
Yep.

1214
01:00:50,920 --> 01:00:55,160
I got inspired by last week, although actually it was also when I went and picked up my box

1215
01:00:55,160 --> 01:00:56,160
of Final Fight Guy.

1216
01:00:56,160 --> 01:00:58,420
I was like, oh yeah, I should do this.

1217
01:00:58,420 --> 01:00:59,420
Because I found the box.

1218
01:00:59,420 --> 01:01:01,080
Hold on for a second, play some music.

1219
01:01:01,080 --> 01:01:02,080
All right, sure.

1220
01:01:02,080 --> 01:01:10,160
This is the final boss fight in Final Fight Guy, which really would be the same as regular

1221
01:01:10,160 --> 01:01:12,760
Final Fight 2, but Fighting Belger.

1222
01:01:12,760 --> 01:01:22,000
Yeah, I'm sorry, I had to get the box, because we're going to take a picture of it.

1223
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:23,000
Wow.

1224
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:24,680
It is, you'll have to put that on the picture site.

1225
01:01:24,680 --> 01:01:25,680
I will.

1226
01:01:25,680 --> 01:01:28,120
Blockbuster exclusive direct from Japan, Final Fantasy Guy.

1227
01:01:28,120 --> 01:01:29,120
Final Fight Guy.

1228
01:01:29,120 --> 01:01:30,120
I'm sorry, Final Fight Guy.

1229
01:01:30,120 --> 01:01:33,440
That was, I got that when I had- Who's going to say Fatal Fury Guy?

1230
01:01:33,440 --> 01:01:34,440
I've done that before, too.

1231
01:01:34,440 --> 01:01:38,320
I had my, uh, this one I had my whole little obsession with getting everything Final Fight

1232
01:01:38,320 --> 01:01:42,560
until they put out a Final Fight that sucks, but I've got Final Fight CD and Mighty Final

1233
01:01:42,560 --> 01:01:46,640
Fight, which was the SD version that came out on Nintendo, but yeah, let me get, actually

1234
01:01:46,640 --> 01:01:47,640
get back to the game.

1235
01:01:47,640 --> 01:01:53,200
Um, Final Fight was an arcade game put out by Capcom, and it was designed by Nishitani

1236
01:01:53,200 --> 01:01:59,760
Akira, who you will see as Nin Nin, and characters were designed by Yasuda Akira, which you'll

1237
01:01:59,760 --> 01:02:05,480
see as Akiman, so some of those things should definitely be familiar, all this Capcom-tastic

1238
01:02:05,480 --> 01:02:06,480
music.

1239
01:02:06,480 --> 01:02:13,320
So yeah, you gotta go rescue, uh, uh, the mayor's daughter, who happens to be, uh, Cody's,

1240
01:02:13,320 --> 01:02:19,480
uh, chick, and the mayor is also a former wrestler named Mike Hagar, who showed up in,

1241
01:02:19,480 --> 01:02:21,720
what, Saturday Night Slam Masters, right?

1242
01:02:21,720 --> 01:02:25,320
Yes, Saturday Night Slam Masters, which is also amazing.

1243
01:02:25,320 --> 01:02:31,420
So when this game, though, came out on the, um, the sneeze, or the SNES, sorry, um, you

1244
01:02:31,420 --> 01:02:35,960
only could play as Cody or Hagar, so they brought out Final Fight Guy, so we could play

1245
01:02:35,960 --> 01:02:36,960
Guy.

1246
01:02:36,960 --> 01:02:43,760
Um, he's, though, super fast and was, like, super awesome to play with, so never mind.

1247
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:47,240
Um, Cody was the balanced guy, Hagar was the strong guy.

1248
01:02:47,240 --> 01:02:51,960
He's also ranked third in EGM's list of Top 10 Video Game Politicians.

1249
01:02:51,960 --> 01:03:00,920
So there were, um, so this game is actually way ahead of, uh, of its time, because it

1250
01:03:00,920 --> 01:03:05,080
actually had pre-op transgender women in it.

1251
01:03:05,080 --> 01:03:06,080
Whatever.

1252
01:03:06,080 --> 01:03:12,420
Anyway, yeah, there are actually two, um, women in the game called Poison and Roxy,

1253
01:03:12,420 --> 01:03:19,040
but they, um, turned them into men named Billy and Sid, for the American version.

1254
01:03:19,040 --> 01:03:20,260
So there were.

1255
01:03:20,260 --> 01:03:22,080
So that you're not hitting women.

1256
01:03:22,080 --> 01:03:23,080
I guess.

1257
01:03:23,080 --> 01:03:27,760
Or hoochie women with really short skirts, and, you know, where you can see underboobs.

1258
01:03:27,760 --> 01:03:28,760
I see.

1259
01:03:28,760 --> 01:03:29,760
Um, there was a- Underboobs.

1260
01:03:29,760 --> 01:03:36,200
You know what I mean, when the shirts- I know, I know what you're talking about, it's just,

1261
01:03:36,200 --> 01:03:39,040
I haven't heard it phrased quite so eloquently before.

1262
01:03:39,040 --> 01:03:43,480
There was also the Andore family that were all based off of Andre the Giant.

1263
01:03:43,480 --> 01:03:44,480
Yeah.

1264
01:03:44,480 --> 01:03:51,280
Um, also, um, a character named 2P that was based, um, off of, uh, Player 2 character

1265
01:03:51,280 --> 01:03:52,280
from Forgotten Worlds.

1266
01:03:52,280 --> 01:03:54,280
Did you ever play that game, Rob?

1267
01:03:54,280 --> 01:03:55,280
Mmm, don't think so.

1268
01:03:55,280 --> 01:03:56,280
It had, like, the special controller.

1269
01:03:56,280 --> 01:04:01,400
It was one of Capcom's kind of interesting weird games, but, um, since he looked like

1270
01:04:01,400 --> 01:04:03,480
the second player, he was called 2P.

1271
01:04:03,480 --> 01:04:04,480
So anyway.

1272
01:04:04,480 --> 01:04:06,840
Um, and then you had your bosses.

1273
01:04:06,840 --> 01:04:10,360
You had Damned, who in the US was Thrasher.

1274
01:04:10,360 --> 01:04:16,840
Um, you had, uh, Sodom, who was, um, called Katana in the US version.

1275
01:04:16,840 --> 01:04:19,960
But, um, he came out, and he was one of the ones that was brought back for Street Fighter

1276
01:04:19,960 --> 01:04:20,960
Alpha series.

1277
01:04:20,960 --> 01:04:26,840
Um, in fact, that's the other video that I linked you up, was the fight with him.

1278
01:04:26,840 --> 01:04:28,640
Let me play that one real quick.

1279
01:04:28,640 --> 01:04:33,240
There's also, uh, Eddie E, and Rolento, who's another one who came in for Street Fighter

1280
01:04:33,240 --> 01:04:35,560
Alpha.

1281
01:04:35,560 --> 01:04:40,920
And then Abigail, who's actually a dude, but if I was named Abigail, I'd probably be frustrated

1282
01:04:40,920 --> 01:04:42,380
and I'm a chick.

1283
01:04:42,380 --> 01:04:45,960
And then Belger, the final guy, who's actually kind of interesting.

1284
01:04:45,960 --> 01:04:51,180
You actually start fighting him while he's holding the girl in his lap, and she ducks

1285
01:04:51,180 --> 01:04:56,760
and screams, and finally he just, you know, she falls over with her butt in the air.

1286
01:04:56,760 --> 01:04:57,760
Seriously.

1287
01:04:57,760 --> 01:05:01,460
Like, that's not wrong.

1288
01:05:01,460 --> 01:05:02,460
So what is this guy?

1289
01:05:02,460 --> 01:05:03,460
You're fighting a guy named Sodom?

1290
01:05:03,460 --> 01:05:04,460
Yeah.

1291
01:05:04,460 --> 01:05:05,840
You have a twin brother named Gamora?

1292
01:05:05,840 --> 01:05:06,840
What is this?

1293
01:05:06,840 --> 01:05:09,200
I, well, you know, that's part of why they changed his name.

1294
01:05:09,200 --> 01:05:13,280
They called him Katana when they came out in the US, but I mean, he's called Sodom in

1295
01:05:13,280 --> 01:05:15,200
Street Fighter Alpha series.

1296
01:05:15,200 --> 01:05:22,920
He's like some guy who, like, some huge, he's like the uber crazy violent otaku guy who's

1297
01:05:22,920 --> 01:05:27,200
like so obsessed with Japanese culture that he, like, wears a samurai hat and football

1298
01:05:27,200 --> 01:05:28,200
armor.

1299
01:05:28,200 --> 01:05:29,200
Or football padding.

1300
01:05:29,200 --> 01:05:30,200
That's stupid.

1301
01:05:30,200 --> 01:05:31,200
But yeah.

1302
01:05:31,200 --> 01:05:42,640
But they said that the basis for Final Fight is actually off Double Dragon 2, the revenge

1303
01:05:42,640 --> 01:05:49,600
in the arcade, so they brought it up and they actually were saying that some of the characters

1304
01:05:49,600 --> 01:05:51,440
were former Street Fighters.

1305
01:05:51,440 --> 01:05:52,440
So it's kind of neat.

1306
01:05:52,440 --> 01:05:56,780
So yeah, there was the whole issue with the ports, and I'm actually going to take a link

1307
01:05:56,780 --> 01:06:04,960
off of the, well, you can actually see pictures up, and I'm going to link them in the chat

1308
01:06:04,960 --> 01:06:14,200
room, of the changes to the characters, to the poison character.

1309
01:06:14,200 --> 01:06:21,400
And then, but now for other versions, there's Sega CD, the Sega CD version, which I have,

1310
01:06:21,400 --> 01:06:23,580
I love Final Fight CD.

1311
01:06:23,580 --> 01:06:27,540
It's got a range soundtrack and a time attack mode.

1312
01:06:27,540 --> 01:06:29,200
It's super fun.

1313
01:06:29,200 --> 01:06:33,680
I've got Final Fight 1 somewhere for GBA.

1314
01:06:33,680 --> 01:06:39,680
There was, when it came out in the US, actually there was an Amiga Atari ST, Commodore 64,

1315
01:06:39,680 --> 01:06:46,200
ZX Spectrum, well that was in Europe, and Amstrad CPC version.

1316
01:06:46,200 --> 01:06:50,480
There was a Sharp X68000 version that came out.

1317
01:06:50,480 --> 01:06:54,880
There was the one I mentioned, Mighty Final Fight, which was the 8-bit version for NES

1318
01:06:54,880 --> 01:06:58,360
that had the super deformed, and it's actually super fun.

1319
01:06:58,360 --> 01:06:59,920
It is really fun and really cute.

1320
01:06:59,920 --> 01:07:01,920
Cheap and Final Fight.

1321
01:07:01,920 --> 01:07:02,920
Yeah.

1322
01:07:02,920 --> 01:07:07,760
Final, well, no, it's super deformed because they are like the really squished up book

1323
01:07:07,760 --> 01:07:08,760
embodies.

1324
01:07:08,760 --> 01:07:11,040
Yeah, I've seen it.

1325
01:07:11,040 --> 01:07:14,760
Also Final Fight came out on the Capcom Classics Collection Volume 1 for PlayStation 2 and

1326
01:07:14,760 --> 01:07:21,240
Xbox and a portable version, Capcom Classics Collection Remix for PSP.

1327
01:07:21,240 --> 01:07:26,440
And it had the emulated CPS music, so that was pretty cool.

1328
01:07:26,440 --> 01:07:33,600
There was also Final Fight Streetwise, which I pretend not to exist because it sucks.

1329
01:07:33,600 --> 01:07:38,800
Or maybe it was the Final Fight Double Imp.

1330
01:07:38,800 --> 01:07:39,800
Nope.

1331
01:07:39,800 --> 01:07:41,840
It was the new one that they tried to do.

1332
01:07:41,840 --> 01:07:42,840
Yeah.

1333
01:07:42,840 --> 01:07:43,840
Whatever.

1334
01:07:43,840 --> 01:07:46,840
Damn, I only knew the Final Fight that was at the local pizza place.

1335
01:07:46,840 --> 01:07:47,840
Oh, there's also sequels.

1336
01:07:47,840 --> 01:07:49,840
There was Final Fight 2 and Final Fight 3.

1337
01:07:49,840 --> 01:07:50,840
I've got those.

1338
01:07:50,840 --> 01:07:52,840
They were actually fun.

1339
01:07:52,840 --> 01:08:02,440
Now, there's also an American Street Fighter animated series, and I know it sucks, but

1340
01:08:02,440 --> 01:08:05,600
they actually had Cody and Guy teaming up with Ken and Ryu.

1341
01:08:05,600 --> 01:08:09,000
It was really weird.

1342
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:13,960
There are also, of course, my KGARs in Saturday Night Slam Masters and Muscle Bomber Duo in

1343
01:08:13,960 --> 01:08:17,480
Slam Masters 2 The Ring of Destruction.

1344
01:08:17,480 --> 01:08:22,120
Street Fighter games, you had Guy and Sodom, then Rolento and Cody in Street Fighter Alpha

1345
01:08:22,120 --> 01:08:23,120
3.

1346
01:08:23,120 --> 01:08:25,840
And then you had in Street Fighter 3 Second Impact, you had the character that was modeled

1347
01:08:25,840 --> 01:08:28,920
after Andori, and his manager is Poison.

1348
01:08:28,920 --> 01:08:32,840
I don't know if you ever played Street Fighter 3.

1349
01:08:32,840 --> 01:08:34,320
Just a couple times.

1350
01:08:34,320 --> 01:08:37,040
That was kind of during that phase where I was out of touch with gaming for a little

1351
01:08:37,040 --> 01:08:38,040
bit.

1352
01:08:38,040 --> 01:08:41,160
And Guy and Guy are actually going to be in Super Street Fighter 4.

1353
01:08:41,160 --> 01:08:44,360
Yeah, and I remember that was the story last week that kind of probably got you thinking

1354
01:08:44,360 --> 01:08:45,360
about this.

1355
01:08:45,360 --> 01:08:46,360
I think that's pretty cool.

1356
01:08:46,360 --> 01:08:52,720
Yeah, there was also another 3D fighting game version, Final Fight Revenge.

1357
01:08:52,720 --> 01:08:56,640
And then, you know, meh.

1358
01:08:56,640 --> 01:09:00,720
But also, now it sort of seems that they used the same format, though, for a lot of the

1359
01:09:00,720 --> 01:09:04,400
other games that came out afterwards, like King of Dragons and Knights of the Round.

1360
01:09:04,400 --> 01:09:10,040
Captain Commando, Warriors of Fate, Cadillacs and Dinosaurs, The Punisher, D&D Tower of

1361
01:09:10,040 --> 01:09:14,800
Doom, and then Alien vs. Predator, though, I think is one of the best games to come after

1362
01:09:14,800 --> 01:09:15,800
that.

1363
01:09:15,800 --> 01:09:19,560
But yeah, a lot of that came through.

1364
01:09:19,560 --> 01:09:21,560
So yeah, Final Fight.

1365
01:09:21,560 --> 01:09:22,560
Win.

1366
01:09:22,560 --> 01:09:23,560
Alright.

1367
01:09:23,560 --> 01:09:26,960
There it is, your classic game of the week, Final Fight, available on lots and lots of

1368
01:09:26,960 --> 01:09:27,960
systems.

1369
01:09:27,960 --> 01:09:28,960
I'll post those pictures.

1370
01:09:28,960 --> 01:09:30,960
The arcade was one of the most memorable.

1371
01:09:30,960 --> 01:09:33,920
Alright, that's going to do it for part A here of Orange Launch Radio, but don't go

1372
01:09:33,920 --> 01:09:39,240
anywhere because we've got plenty more to come in part B, including your Twitter topics,

1373
01:09:39,240 --> 01:09:42,680
which I haven't put a call out for on Twitter yet, but we'll get those.

1374
01:09:42,680 --> 01:09:44,280
And I haven't seen any emails this week.

1375
01:09:44,280 --> 01:09:46,760
I don't even know if we'll have any of those, but we'll get to those.

1376
01:09:46,760 --> 01:09:50,800
But we do have some news, if nothing else, talking about Red Box expanding to Game Rental,

1377
01:09:50,800 --> 01:09:54,280
which I think has come up on the show before, but now it's going to the next step.

1378
01:09:54,280 --> 01:09:56,080
Somebody beat World of Warcraft.

1379
01:09:56,080 --> 01:09:58,080
Yes, somebody beat it.

1380
01:09:58,080 --> 01:10:02,640
More things to waste money on your Xbox Live avatars with, and of course, it wouldn't be

1381
01:10:02,640 --> 01:10:05,840
Lolsy if we didn't talk about an adult game, so we'll be talking about that all in the

1382
01:10:05,840 --> 01:10:06,840
next segment.

1383
01:10:06,840 --> 01:10:07,840
So stay tuned.

1384
01:10:07,840 --> 01:10:16,480
We'll be right back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

1385
01:10:16,480 --> 01:10:20,560
Hello everybody, and welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio on this lovely Sunday evening,

1386
01:10:20,560 --> 01:10:26,280
December the 6th of 2009, where we're eagerly anticipating snow tomorrow here in Sacramento,

1387
01:10:26,280 --> 01:10:29,840
where Orange Lounge Radio is based, when we never, and this is a big deal, I realize some

1388
01:10:29,840 --> 01:10:33,200
of you live in the East Coast and even in other countries where snow is probably no

1389
01:10:33,200 --> 01:10:34,200
big deal.

1390
01:10:34,200 --> 01:10:35,280
In fact, you probably hate it.

1391
01:10:35,280 --> 01:10:39,600
But we never see snow here, so even the fact that it's just going to even sprinkle a little

1392
01:10:39,600 --> 01:10:41,480
white tomorrow is going to be amazing.

1393
01:10:41,480 --> 01:10:42,480
I'm excited.

1394
01:10:42,480 --> 01:10:44,160
Too bad it's not Christmas tomorrow.

1395
01:10:44,160 --> 01:10:46,440
That would make it even better, but oh well.

1396
01:10:46,440 --> 01:10:48,040
So we're all excited about that.

1397
01:10:48,040 --> 01:10:52,760
Anyhow, we've got plenty more news to get into tonight here on Orange Lounge Radio.

1398
01:10:52,760 --> 01:10:57,120
Of course, we always tape live every Sunday night at All Games Radio at 6 o'clock Pacific,

1399
01:10:57,120 --> 01:11:01,160
9 o'clock Eastern Time, right at the close of the Bobby Black Wolf Show, which is on

1400
01:11:01,160 --> 01:11:05,840
one hour before we start at 5 or 8, depending on where you live.

1401
01:11:05,840 --> 01:11:10,960
We're going to get into some rapid fire news, and then we'll get into your Twitter topics

1402
01:11:10,960 --> 01:11:12,160
in just a little bit.

1403
01:11:12,160 --> 01:11:15,160
Send them on Twitter if you have anything you want to send us.

1404
01:11:15,160 --> 01:11:16,160
Yes.

1405
01:11:16,160 --> 01:11:20,400
So one of the games that's coming out this week, The Saboteur, is getting some day one

1406
01:11:20,400 --> 01:11:22,160
DLC.

1407
01:11:22,160 --> 01:11:27,880
And this is to entice you to buy the game new, because if you don't buy it new, then

1408
01:11:27,880 --> 01:11:30,080
you'll have to purchase this separately.

1409
01:11:30,080 --> 01:11:35,520
But what you get with the game is a code to download The Midnight Show.

1410
01:11:35,520 --> 01:11:40,040
And what The Midnight Show is, well, it's the nudity that's in The Saboteur.

1411
01:11:40,040 --> 01:11:47,720
Lots of naked chicks that do little dances for you, and contains new hiding spots, a

1412
01:11:47,720 --> 01:11:53,080
new minigame, and of course, it's an option to unlock the nudity, so if you really don't

1413
01:11:53,080 --> 01:11:56,540
want to see naked women, then you don't have to.

1414
01:11:56,540 --> 01:11:59,840
And once again, if you do pick up the game used, you will be able to get the download

1415
01:11:59,840 --> 01:12:00,840
content.

1416
01:12:00,840 --> 01:12:07,720
It's going to cost you $3 or 240 Microsoft points.

1417
01:12:07,720 --> 01:12:08,720
Let's see.

1418
01:12:08,720 --> 01:12:14,000
Dante's Inferno, the God of War-esque type game, will be coming to the PlayStation Network

1419
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:18,400
and Xbox Live Marketplace in the form of a demo soon.

1420
01:12:18,400 --> 01:12:21,920
The PlayStation Network will get it a few weeks early, in fact, you'll be able to pick

1421
01:12:21,920 --> 01:12:25,080
it up next week on Thursday, December 10th.

1422
01:12:25,080 --> 01:12:29,600
The Xbox Live Marketplace will be getting it on December 24th.

1423
01:12:29,600 --> 01:12:35,920
And the game itself is not scheduled to come out until, I believe, February, so got a ways

1424
01:12:35,920 --> 01:12:36,920
there.

1425
01:12:36,920 --> 01:12:41,640
And then finally, Santa Claus is coming to PlayStation Home.

1426
01:12:41,640 --> 01:12:49,360
And you will be able to interact with Santa Claus and the elves and whatnot, and they

1427
01:12:49,360 --> 01:12:52,440
also have different minigames as well.

1428
01:12:52,440 --> 01:12:59,120
And of course, there's also a photo elf that you can take pictures with or get some decorated

1429
01:12:59,120 --> 01:13:03,400
pictures for your home.

1430
01:13:03,400 --> 01:13:06,600
When I ask for a BB gun, will he tell me you'll shoot your eye out?

1431
01:13:06,600 --> 01:13:07,600
Perhaps.

1432
01:13:07,600 --> 01:13:11,840
You know what's funny is my character is still dressed like Santa from last year.

1433
01:13:11,840 --> 01:13:13,480
Nice.

1434
01:13:13,480 --> 01:13:14,840
And that's how it's gonna stay.

1435
01:13:14,840 --> 01:13:15,840
Now you need to change it.

1436
01:13:15,840 --> 01:13:20,600
You need to change it to like a Halloween outfit or something now that it's Christmas.

1437
01:13:20,600 --> 01:13:21,600
Nope.

1438
01:13:21,600 --> 01:13:22,600
Still gonna be Santa.

1439
01:13:22,600 --> 01:13:23,600
You'll be like Jack Skellington.

1440
01:13:23,600 --> 01:13:26,880
Cause my guy is like a hobo.

1441
01:13:26,880 --> 01:13:29,560
Cause you actually paid money for the Santa costume, right?

1442
01:13:29,560 --> 01:13:30,560
Hobo Santa?

1443
01:13:30,560 --> 01:13:32,200
Yeah, well that's the only costume I'm wearing.

1444
01:13:32,200 --> 01:13:35,720
Did you ever log into home, like during June or anything?

1445
01:13:35,720 --> 01:13:36,960
We still have that club in home.

1446
01:13:36,960 --> 01:13:40,600
I haven't checked in like a week to see if there's any new people, so sorry if I haven't

1447
01:13:40,600 --> 01:13:41,600
gone to.

1448
01:13:41,600 --> 01:13:43,760
But yeah, we still have that little clubhouse in home.

1449
01:13:43,760 --> 01:13:45,480
Don't know what to do with it.

1450
01:13:45,480 --> 01:13:48,360
It's been suggested maybe we should have a OLR home meetup.

1451
01:13:48,360 --> 01:13:49,360
So maybe someday.

1452
01:13:49,360 --> 01:13:50,360
We'll see.

1453
01:13:50,360 --> 01:13:53,460
Anyhow, going into some other rapid fire news.

1454
01:13:53,460 --> 01:13:54,460
Big sale at Walmart.

1455
01:13:54,460 --> 01:13:59,900
If you still do not have a Wii, now might be the time to do that because for one week

1456
01:13:59,900 --> 01:14:04,840
from December 5th to 12th, every Wii will come with a $50 gift card.

1457
01:14:04,840 --> 01:14:12,840
So you take $199 for the Wii, eliminate $50, that's basically give or take $150 for a Wii.

1458
01:14:12,840 --> 01:14:17,760
Which you could use the $50 gift card to buy games or whatever else you need at Walmart.

1459
01:14:17,760 --> 01:14:19,840
Also there's some big price dips in games.

1460
01:14:19,840 --> 01:14:23,220
I wouldn't be surprised if those Wiis were already sold out, sadly, by the time you hear

1461
01:14:23,220 --> 01:14:24,600
this show.

1462
01:14:24,600 --> 01:14:25,600
But you never know.

1463
01:14:25,600 --> 01:14:28,000
Check your Walmart because that deal is supposed to be good for all this week.

1464
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:29,700
They might get more shipments during the week.

1465
01:14:29,700 --> 01:14:30,880
You never know what might happen.

1466
01:14:30,880 --> 01:14:32,600
But keep an eye out for those cheap deals.

1467
01:14:32,600 --> 01:14:35,200
It's not just Black Friday.

1468
01:14:35,200 --> 01:14:39,480
Well I didn't think this game could be possibly ported anywhere else, but I was proven wrong.

1469
01:14:39,480 --> 01:14:42,020
Dragon's Lair is coming out for the iPhone.

1470
01:14:42,020 --> 01:14:46,720
That's right, the old school 1983 laser disc game Dragon's Lair that's been released on

1471
01:14:46,720 --> 01:14:54,240
every single console ever, it seems like anyway, is now coming to the iPhone thanks to Electronic

1472
01:14:54,240 --> 01:14:56,300
Arts who is doing the port.

1473
01:14:56,300 --> 01:14:57,720
Not sure exactly how they're doing it.

1474
01:14:57,720 --> 01:15:00,200
It looks like you have little up, down, left, right arrows on the screen.

1475
01:15:00,200 --> 01:15:02,280
Right, except the corners of the screen.

1476
01:15:02,280 --> 01:15:06,000
Basically a big button on the other side for the sword button there.

1477
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:10,120
It is coming out for five bucks, I think?

1478
01:15:10,120 --> 01:15:12,000
Because that's what Space Ace is priced at.

1479
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:15,600
So they don't have a final price yet, but Space Ace is five bucks.

1480
01:15:15,600 --> 01:15:18,720
They also had Cobra Command as well, which is very similar.

1481
01:15:18,720 --> 01:15:22,720
I might need to get Dragon's Lair, except you know what I just found while I was cleaning

1482
01:15:22,720 --> 01:15:24,720
off my desk?

1483
01:15:24,720 --> 01:15:26,720
Dragon's Lair?

1484
01:15:26,720 --> 01:15:28,920
Dragon's Lair HD.

1485
01:15:28,920 --> 01:15:31,880
Oh, the HD kind of different one they did a while ago.

1486
01:15:31,880 --> 01:15:32,880
Yeah, I remember that.

1487
01:15:32,880 --> 01:15:34,760
Hidden under a layer of stuff.

1488
01:15:34,760 --> 01:15:35,760
Wow.

1489
01:15:35,760 --> 01:15:39,520
I tell you, I sneeze and find games, Rob.

1490
01:15:39,520 --> 01:15:42,000
I still need to take a picture of Final Fight Guy, don't I?

1491
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:43,000
Yes you do.

1492
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:45,320
Yeah, so I don't know.

1493
01:15:45,320 --> 01:15:48,960
I will always be partial to the Dragon's Lair that was on the Commodore 64.

1494
01:15:48,960 --> 01:15:50,120
It was way different.

1495
01:15:50,120 --> 01:15:52,640
It was like a completely different game.

1496
01:15:52,640 --> 01:15:55,980
Harder than hell, but a lot of fun, I have to admit.

1497
01:15:55,980 --> 01:15:57,520
That's the one I'll always be partial to.

1498
01:15:57,520 --> 01:15:59,880
Anyhow, how about some news about Rock Band?

1499
01:15:59,880 --> 01:16:03,040
Of course, it wouldn't be a week here at OLR if we didn't have news about upcoming Rock

1500
01:16:03,040 --> 01:16:04,280
Band releases.

1501
01:16:04,280 --> 01:16:06,720
More Green Day coming out for Rock Band.

1502
01:16:06,720 --> 01:16:10,840
Apparently Christian's Inferno, Last of the American Girls, and Viva La Gloria, which

1503
01:16:10,840 --> 01:16:15,600
I believe are all off the latest CD, 21st Century Breakdown, are on their way on December

1504
01:16:15,600 --> 01:16:21,680
15th or December 17th, depending on what system you're on.

1505
01:16:21,680 --> 01:16:25,360
But also to look forward to in Rock Band, some songs coming out within the next couple

1506
01:16:25,360 --> 01:16:26,360
of weeks.

1507
01:16:26,360 --> 01:16:29,400
This week, actually, December 8th or December 10th.

1508
01:16:29,400 --> 01:16:32,800
Slipknot songs, Duality, Psychosocial, and Sulphur.

1509
01:16:32,800 --> 01:16:36,600
And then some individual tracks, a track by Lights Resolve called Dreaming of Love, which

1510
01:16:36,600 --> 01:16:40,160
is free, by the way, so you can check that out for free.

1511
01:16:40,160 --> 01:16:45,080
And this is kind of awesome in a real dorky sort of way, Simon and Garfunkel are getting

1512
01:16:45,080 --> 01:16:46,880
some songs in Rock Band.

1513
01:16:46,880 --> 01:16:51,860
I Am A Rock and The Sounds of Silence, because when you want to rock, I know the first thing

1514
01:16:51,860 --> 01:16:54,120
you think of is Simon and Garfunkel.

1515
01:16:54,120 --> 01:16:56,960
Dark Soccer, what do you got for us tonight?

1516
01:16:56,960 --> 01:17:02,700
Just a few things, actually, and it isn't actually the page I was looking at about the

1517
01:17:02,700 --> 01:17:12,360
land of make-believe, Gearbox actually trademarked border worlds, so the rumor is that Borderlands

1518
01:17:12,360 --> 01:17:19,480
could be extended into an actual universe of games, and Borderlands is pretty fun from

1519
01:17:19,480 --> 01:17:23,720
what I've seen, so I could see, and you know, everyone I've actually talked to that's played

1520
01:17:23,720 --> 01:17:26,080
it says that it's a fantastic game.

1521
01:17:26,080 --> 01:17:31,080
So I can actually see the expansion happening, you know, I think it'd be a good thing.

1522
01:17:31,080 --> 01:17:34,400
Lots of, you know, shooting midgets.

1523
01:17:34,400 --> 01:17:39,760
And then the UK has a date for Metal Gear Solid Peace Walker, it will be the 28th of

1524
01:17:39,760 --> 01:17:51,520
May, and of course that's going to be on, sorry, PSP, and actually in Japan it's going

1525
01:17:51,520 --> 01:17:54,420
to be coming out on March 18th.

1526
01:17:54,420 --> 01:17:59,900
So four-player co-op, it can be Snake, Snake-oo!

1527
01:17:59,900 --> 01:18:08,120
And then Squeenix put out a song, a game, a song summoner for iPhone, it's actually

1528
01:18:08,120 --> 01:18:16,080
called Song Summoner The Unsung Heroes for iPhone and iPod Touch, and that it's got touchscreen

1529
01:18:16,080 --> 01:18:23,120
controls of course, and characters in different scenarios, and it's supposed to be out, there's

1530
01:18:23,120 --> 01:18:30,000
a demo for it out actually, and for UK customers it'll be £5.99, so.

1531
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:34,760
I've heard that Song Summoner is kind of anth though, because it was out on the old-school

1532
01:18:34,760 --> 01:18:40,480
iPod, you know, well, in other words the iPods a lot of people still have really, they came

1533
01:18:40,480 --> 01:18:45,040
out on those a while ago, and I think it was kind of under the radar because the iPhones

1534
01:18:45,040 --> 01:18:47,960
and iTouches had already come out and a lot of those releases got missed, but.

1535
01:18:47,960 --> 01:18:51,280
I'd like to see what they've actually managed to do with it.

1536
01:18:51,280 --> 01:18:53,640
Yeah, you never know, they might have like kind of changed some things and done some

1537
01:18:53,640 --> 01:18:57,800
upgrades too, so it would be kind of cool to see what is going on.

1538
01:18:57,800 --> 01:19:01,280
What I'd like to see what's going on with right now is the Twitter topic, so let's open

1539
01:19:01,280 --> 01:19:05,680
up ye old Twitter, and see what you guys have to say, a very fast night with the Twitter

1540
01:19:05,680 --> 01:19:08,360
topics by the way, I'm quite impressed.

1541
01:19:08,360 --> 01:19:12,040
SEG starting us off tonight, of course with another plug for OOMLOUD, because that's happening

1542
01:19:12,040 --> 01:19:15,520
this week, SEG wants to know, are y'all going to OOMLOUD?

1543
01:19:15,520 --> 01:19:19,240
I'm going for sure, but I think the fact that it's on a weeknight is kind of screwing with

1544
01:19:19,240 --> 01:19:20,640
everyone else because it is a couple hours away.

1545
01:19:20,640 --> 01:19:22,520
Everyone has to usually work at six in the morning.

1546
01:19:22,520 --> 01:19:25,640
Yeah, I'm able to kind of swing it where I'm getting off work a little early so I can make

1547
01:19:25,640 --> 01:19:29,080
it, but it might, I might be the sole representation there.

1548
01:19:29,080 --> 01:19:34,640
Sorry, but I'm going to have three times the fun, so meh.

1549
01:19:34,640 --> 01:19:38,560
Hope to see some of you listeners there that are local to San Francisco.

1550
01:19:38,560 --> 01:19:41,960
Alex Carson says, I'm going to make a PSP app for your show if that's okay with you

1551
01:19:41,960 --> 01:19:42,960
guys.

1552
01:19:42,960 --> 01:19:50,400
Actually, we do have a PSP website, olrpsp.com, and you can download a PSP radio tuner there,

1553
01:19:50,400 --> 01:19:53,800
I forgot about that in the earlier part of the show, because Loki hasn't updated it in

1554
01:19:53,800 --> 01:19:57,160
a couple years, so whereas you might have some broken graphics and things, I think it

1555
01:19:57,160 --> 01:19:58,160
still works, right?

1556
01:19:58,160 --> 01:20:01,920
Loki, I don't know, have you checked that out in a while?

1557
01:20:01,920 --> 01:20:03,440
I think it still sort of works.

1558
01:20:03,440 --> 01:20:04,440
Yeah.

1559
01:20:04,440 --> 01:20:05,440
So you might want to check that out.

1560
01:20:05,440 --> 01:20:09,120
If you can make it better, hey, we are not going to complain.

1561
01:20:09,120 --> 01:20:11,440
I got to tell you, we would be very excited about that.

1562
01:20:11,440 --> 01:20:15,000
Spazinator going off on us a little bit, no offense, but Californians don't know squat

1563
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:16,000
about snow.

1564
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:19,000
Try sending many winters in Buffalo, then you'll know about snow.

1565
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:21,000
No, I agree.

1566
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:24,520
The one-eighth of an inch of snow you're getting pales in comparison to what we usually get,

1567
01:20:24,520 --> 01:20:26,400
six inches to as much as two feet.

1568
01:20:26,400 --> 01:20:29,600
I do want to say, though, careful, because when you say Californians, you're talking

1569
01:20:29,600 --> 01:20:33,880
about the entire state of California, we do have actually a lot of snowy places in California.

1570
01:20:33,880 --> 01:20:39,000
I don't live in one, but we have Lake Tahoe, for example, they get a lot of snow up there,

1571
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:44,680
so careful, California is not all beaches and surfers.

1572
01:20:44,680 --> 01:20:45,680
Let's see.

1573
01:20:45,680 --> 01:20:52,560
Dark Tetsuya says, Arcade Heroes is picking the best arcade game of the past decade, 2000

1574
01:20:52,560 --> 01:20:54,240
to 2009.

1575
01:20:54,240 --> 01:20:55,240
Thoughts?

1576
01:20:55,240 --> 01:20:59,720
My thought is, I'm kind of sad because this was the decade that arcades kind of died and

1577
01:20:59,720 --> 01:21:03,680
got replaced with ticket redemption machines, so I don't know if I have an easy answer.

1578
01:21:03,680 --> 01:21:11,200
Anyone have an answer for what the best arcade game of the past 10 years would be?

1579
01:21:11,200 --> 01:21:12,200
Strider 2.

1580
01:21:12,200 --> 01:21:15,240
I mean, obviously, DDR was somewhat impactful for us.

1581
01:21:15,240 --> 01:21:16,240
Strider 2?

1582
01:21:16,240 --> 01:21:26,200
I would say also maybe like, what was it, oh gosh, oh, I know, Final Furlong, horsey

1583
01:21:26,200 --> 01:21:27,200
riding game.

1584
01:21:27,200 --> 01:21:28,200
Final Furlong.

1585
01:21:28,200 --> 01:21:29,200
Horsey Humping!

1586
01:21:29,200 --> 01:21:30,200
Yes, and Derby Owner's Club.

1587
01:21:30,200 --> 01:21:31,200
Derby was pretty good.

1588
01:21:31,200 --> 01:21:35,240
I would say Derby Owner's Club just because it's so fucking epic, like when you see it.

1589
01:21:35,240 --> 01:21:41,080
I mean, it's like, it's the size of an arcade, amazing.

1590
01:21:41,080 --> 01:21:43,200
So there you go, those would be some of my picks.

1591
01:21:43,200 --> 01:21:48,600
And if none of those work, then eh, Marvel vs. Capcom 2 is pretty fucking sweet, I gotta

1592
01:21:48,600 --> 01:21:49,600
say.

1593
01:21:49,600 --> 01:21:54,160
Let's see, other topics here.

1594
01:21:54,160 --> 01:21:59,440
Fernando says on the Twitter, Sky, I love you, let's repeal Prop 8 and get married.

1595
01:21:59,440 --> 01:22:04,880
Hey, I'm all about repealing Prop 8, which is some major bullshit, but I think you might

1596
01:22:04,880 --> 01:22:08,900
need to take me to dinner first before I agree to get married, just saying.

1597
01:22:08,900 --> 01:22:13,560
Alex Carson wants to know, how many of you are phone freakers?

1598
01:22:13,560 --> 01:22:14,560
What is that?

1599
01:22:14,560 --> 01:22:16,200
I don't even, like it's like hacking your phone, right?

1600
01:22:16,200 --> 01:22:17,200
Yeah, I'm not.

1601
01:22:17,200 --> 01:22:21,800
Is that like, back in the day, like people used to modify like those Captain Crunch whistles

1602
01:22:21,800 --> 01:22:26,040
to be able to like, dial the phones, when back in the day it was the rotary pulse dials?

1603
01:22:26,040 --> 01:22:28,320
Like is that the kind of stuff we're talking about?

1604
01:22:28,320 --> 01:22:30,160
Like old school hacking stuff?

1605
01:22:30,160 --> 01:22:35,680
I find that stuff interesting, but I don't do it myself.

1606
01:22:35,680 --> 01:22:37,640
Plus it's all like cell phones now.

1607
01:22:37,640 --> 01:22:44,400
I've decided what I'm going to do when I get my new iPhone, is take my old one and pimp

1608
01:22:44,400 --> 01:22:48,320
it out to look all steampunk, which I'm probably going to do with my new one, because even

1609
01:22:48,320 --> 01:22:52,360
though yes, it's a great design, a lot of work went into the design of it, I bought

1610
01:22:52,360 --> 01:22:57,160
it, I want to change it up a bit, so I'm going to, but I've decided that I'm going to release

1611
01:22:57,160 --> 01:23:03,960
it as the limited edition Dark Sakura old school iPhone, and sell it for 700 bucks.

1612
01:23:03,960 --> 01:23:09,960
Let's see, Javier Altman on Twitter says, OLR, pick your topic, the platypus is made

1613
01:23:09,960 --> 01:23:15,400
out of other animal spare parts, or the Saboteur Boobies DLC with love footy.

1614
01:23:15,400 --> 01:23:20,500
Well, we already talked about the Saboteur Boobies DLC, so the platypus is made out of

1615
01:23:20,500 --> 01:23:21,800
other animal spare parts.

1616
01:23:21,800 --> 01:23:24,360
Isn't that like a hot dog, actually, you're talking about?

1617
01:23:24,360 --> 01:23:29,840
I think that the platypus is God going, see?

1618
01:23:29,840 --> 01:23:35,200
Blue Swim says, what do you think of the Best Buy giving DSI buyers a free copy of Tony

1619
01:23:35,200 --> 01:23:40,320
Hawk's Motion, a game which requires a GBA port to play?

1620
01:23:40,320 --> 01:23:44,200
This is where if I had the Price is Right losing horn queued up, I'd play it right now.

1621
01:23:44,200 --> 01:23:46,480
That's kind of humorous, actually, in a sick way.

1622
01:23:46,480 --> 01:23:47,480
That's hilarious.

1623
01:23:47,480 --> 01:23:48,480
That's a Best Buy movie.

1624
01:23:48,480 --> 01:23:51,680
I didn't hear about that at all, actually, so thank you for bringing that to my attention,

1625
01:23:51,680 --> 01:23:54,880
because it's pretty lolsy.

1626
01:23:54,880 --> 01:23:59,920
Master of the Claw sent us a YouTube link to some people having fun jamming.

1627
01:23:59,920 --> 01:24:03,320
Look at that, they're getting down.

1628
01:24:03,320 --> 01:24:05,200
Oh my God, they're dancing to Bird is the Word.

1629
01:24:05,200 --> 01:24:07,320
It reminds me of that Family Guy episode.

1630
01:24:07,320 --> 01:24:10,400
They're playing a game called Just Dance on the Wii.

1631
01:24:10,400 --> 01:24:12,400
Bird is the Word.

1632
01:24:12,400 --> 01:24:14,160
Bird, bird, bird.

1633
01:24:14,160 --> 01:24:15,520
Did you hear?

1634
01:24:15,520 --> 01:24:18,160
Bird is the Word.

1635
01:24:18,160 --> 01:24:22,120
The fact that it's in that game, that makes the game 100% good.

1636
01:24:22,120 --> 01:24:27,360
Yeah, I heard of this game and it looked ridiculous, but now that I know that it's tongue-in-cheek

1637
01:24:27,360 --> 01:24:32,400
ridiculous, I'm far more interested, so thank you for bringing it to my attention.

1638
01:24:32,400 --> 01:24:36,640
That guy is just getting down in that chick.

1639
01:24:36,640 --> 01:24:38,800
I don't think that chick would be getting down like this, though, if you weren't paying

1640
01:24:38,800 --> 01:24:39,800
her to do it.

1641
01:24:39,800 --> 01:24:42,960
She looks a little bit emo.

1642
01:24:42,960 --> 01:24:44,140
That's awesome.

1643
01:24:44,140 --> 01:24:46,760
That game does kind of look like fun, actually.

1644
01:24:46,760 --> 01:24:48,160
Thank you, Just Dance on the Wii.

1645
01:24:48,160 --> 01:24:49,880
I am assuming that's out now?

1646
01:24:49,880 --> 01:24:50,880
I don't know.

1647
01:24:50,880 --> 01:24:51,880
Yes, that's out now.

1648
01:24:51,880 --> 01:24:52,880
I don't know, Loki.

1649
01:24:52,880 --> 01:24:53,880
Been out for a few weeks.

1650
01:24:53,880 --> 01:24:55,680
Loki, we might have to play that and YouTube it.

1651
01:24:55,680 --> 01:24:57,680
No, we don't.

1652
01:24:57,680 --> 01:24:59,280
No, we don't.

1653
01:24:59,280 --> 01:25:01,720
But Loki, didn't you hear?

1654
01:25:01,720 --> 01:25:03,000
Bird is the Word.

1655
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:07,220
Yes, and granted, I love that song, but I'm not going to play that game.

1656
01:25:07,220 --> 01:25:08,800
They want a link in chat here.

1657
01:25:08,800 --> 01:25:09,800
Here you go, chatters.

1658
01:25:09,800 --> 01:25:10,800
There's the link.

1659
01:25:10,800 --> 01:25:17,920
It's a bit L-Y link I got from Master of the Claw on Twitter, so you win Twitter tonight,

1660
01:25:17,920 --> 01:25:21,560
Master of the Claw for getting the bird as the word, and that dancing.

1661
01:25:21,560 --> 01:25:22,560
Did you notice?

1662
01:25:22,560 --> 01:25:24,080
They were actually walking around, clucking like chickens.

1663
01:25:24,080 --> 01:25:28,920
Granted, they were Ubisoft employees, but they tend to go over, yeah.

1664
01:25:28,920 --> 01:25:32,600
That could be the game of the year right there, if we didn't have President Cat this year.

1665
01:25:32,600 --> 01:25:35,840
Speaking of President Cat, I got to get this out here real quick.

1666
01:25:35,840 --> 01:25:41,560
Did you know there's still no word about President Cat getting a release over here in the US?

1667
01:25:41,560 --> 01:25:42,560
Just so you know.

1668
01:25:42,560 --> 01:25:48,200
There's still no word on that, but do you know what game is coming out on WiiWare in

1669
01:25:48,200 --> 01:25:49,520
a couple months?

1670
01:25:49,520 --> 01:25:50,520
Is that Muscle March?

1671
01:25:50,520 --> 01:25:52,040
Muscle March is coming out.

1672
01:25:52,040 --> 01:25:53,880
Do you know what Muscle March is?

1673
01:25:53,880 --> 01:25:59,440
If you don't know what Muscle March is, you need to YouTube this game immediately, because

1674
01:25:59,440 --> 01:26:08,060
it's like, it's awesome, but it's like, imagine Cho Aniki meets that game, meets that game

1675
01:26:08,060 --> 01:26:13,080
show where you have to twist your body to not fall through the wall or whatever, meets

1676
01:26:13,080 --> 01:26:19,780
crack, pure adulterated crack.

1677
01:26:19,780 --> 01:26:23,360
I can't believe that game is coming out and yet no word on President Cat, I'm just saying.

1678
01:26:23,360 --> 01:26:30,400
And all this bullshit about President Cat only sold a hundred copies, source please!

1679
01:26:30,400 --> 01:26:33,160
I mean, I know probably like a hundred people over here that imported it.

1680
01:26:33,160 --> 01:26:36,120
Apparently it got a shout out on the 1UP show this week.

1681
01:26:36,120 --> 01:26:37,120
I don't listen to that show.

1682
01:26:37,120 --> 01:26:40,880
Yeah, they discovered the game, and so therefore they're informing the internet of the game

1683
01:26:40,880 --> 01:26:44,040
and they should come over here, and they're the first ones that ever discovered the game.

1684
01:26:44,040 --> 01:26:45,040
Clearly, yes, they just-

1685
01:26:45,040 --> 01:26:46,880
Um, how about they're full of shit?

1686
01:26:46,880 --> 01:26:48,440
Everybody, send letters!

1687
01:26:48,440 --> 01:26:51,240
Well, to be fair, they didn't call it President Cat.

1688
01:26:51,240 --> 01:26:54,000
If they had called it President Cat, I would say something.

1689
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:55,000
But we referred to it by name.

1690
01:26:55,000 --> 01:26:56,000
Yeah, I know.

1691
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:57,000
I'm just...

1692
01:26:57,000 --> 01:26:58,000
It doesn't matter.

1693
01:26:58,000 --> 01:26:59,640
It matters to me!

1694
01:26:59,640 --> 01:27:01,280
How dare they steal our thunder!

1695
01:27:01,280 --> 01:27:02,400
I don't, I don't care.

1696
01:27:02,400 --> 01:27:03,400
I care!

1697
01:27:03,400 --> 01:27:06,640
I'm all about spreading the word about the game, and if it gets it out there, then whatever.

1698
01:27:06,640 --> 01:27:11,160
We, it's time, no, no, that's why we don't get recognized, Rob.

1699
01:27:11,160 --> 01:27:12,160
We need to pimp ourselves.

1700
01:27:12,160 --> 01:27:13,160
You can't prove it.

1701
01:27:13,160 --> 01:27:14,160
You can't prove it.

1702
01:27:14,160 --> 01:27:15,160
I've got the internet.

1703
01:27:15,160 --> 01:27:16,160
I have the days to post.

1704
01:27:16,160 --> 01:27:17,160
Alright.

1705
01:27:17,160 --> 01:27:19,160
I've got to go on a joystick, and, you know.

1706
01:27:19,160 --> 01:27:24,080
You've got Joystick and Destructoid backing us up, so nah.

1707
01:27:24,080 --> 01:27:25,320
I just don't care enough.

1708
01:27:25,320 --> 01:27:26,320
I'm sorry.

1709
01:27:26,320 --> 01:27:27,960
I don't care enough.

1710
01:27:27,960 --> 01:27:30,760
I don't want to become the President Cat show, okay?

1711
01:27:30,760 --> 01:27:31,760
And to be fair-

1712
01:27:31,760 --> 01:27:32,760
It had its moment.

1713
01:27:32,760 --> 01:27:33,760
I'm over it.

1714
01:27:33,760 --> 01:27:37,520
I listened to a little bit of, you know, that, the podcast, and they're like, yeah, we heard

1715
01:27:37,520 --> 01:27:42,160
it sold, like, 80 copies, so, because there's 81, yo-ho!

1716
01:27:42,160 --> 01:27:44,760
Ah, yeah, yeah.

1717
01:27:44,760 --> 01:27:50,000
They're firing on all cylinders over there.

1718
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:54,640
Let's see, um, where was I?

1719
01:27:54,640 --> 01:27:59,880
Matt Ostrowski tweeted us, by the way, one more tweet here that the OLR listeners will

1720
01:27:59,880 --> 01:28:00,880
want to know.

1721
01:28:00,880 --> 01:28:05,720
OLR Evolution's second mix will be coming out December 24th for everyone.

1722
01:28:05,720 --> 01:28:09,100
Oh, that's cool, like a little Christmas present, or Hanukkah present, if you will, whatever

1723
01:28:09,100 --> 01:28:11,600
it is you're into, or Kwanzaa, I don't care.

1724
01:28:11,600 --> 01:28:15,880
Whatever you celebrate, Solstice, or, you know, what do Pastafarians celebrate on Christmas,

1725
01:28:15,880 --> 01:28:16,880
I guess?

1726
01:28:16,880 --> 01:28:19,320
They, uh, celebrate, uh, Nokimas.

1727
01:28:19,320 --> 01:28:21,760
I guess that's what it is, a pirate day.

1728
01:28:21,760 --> 01:28:26,120
Um, anyhow, whatever it is you celebrate this winter, OLR Evolution's second mix is coming

1729
01:28:26,120 --> 01:28:31,440
out, and if you don't know what that is, it's like a DDR clone type thing, or, they take

1730
01:28:31,440 --> 01:28:36,080
one of those DDR sims, and they completely reskin it with OLR-related songs, and I think

1731
01:28:36,080 --> 01:28:39,200
they even, like, take clips of our voice, and now we're, like, the announcers in the

1732
01:28:39,200 --> 01:28:40,200
game.

1733
01:28:40,200 --> 01:28:42,160
So, it's a lot of great fan work.

1734
01:28:42,160 --> 01:28:43,160
It's, you know what-

1735
01:28:43,160 --> 01:28:44,680
I mean, I definitely need to check this out.

1736
01:28:44,680 --> 01:28:46,640
I take it as a big compliment.

1737
01:28:46,640 --> 01:28:47,640
It's amazing.

1738
01:28:47,640 --> 01:28:49,400
So thank you very much, fans, for putting that together.

1739
01:28:49,400 --> 01:28:50,400
You guys rock.

1740
01:28:50,400 --> 01:28:52,360
That Just Dance game looks interesting.

1741
01:28:52,360 --> 01:28:53,640
Doesn't Just Dance kind of look like fun?

1742
01:28:53,640 --> 01:28:57,080
It's just, it's only because that song's in there, if it's any other song, I wouldn't

1743
01:28:57,080 --> 01:28:58,080
give it to it.

1744
01:28:58,080 --> 01:29:00,620
I will admit, to the tweeter who asked why the hell we hadn't talked about it before,

1745
01:29:00,620 --> 01:29:04,200
when I saw the box art in, like, the songs they were advertising, I was like, eh, this

1746
01:29:04,200 --> 01:29:05,800
is, like, gonna be Weech here, or something.

1747
01:29:05,800 --> 01:29:10,840
I just, I did dismiss it very quickly, but it looks like it could be ridiculous fun.

1748
01:29:10,840 --> 01:29:11,840
Who knows?

1749
01:29:11,840 --> 01:29:17,040
If it was called Just Dance featuring the bird, Surfing Bird, you know, a hundred thousand

1750
01:29:17,040 --> 01:29:19,120
more copies sold right there.

1751
01:29:19,120 --> 01:29:24,760
All right, let's move on to some more gaming news and Loki.

1752
01:29:24,760 --> 01:29:35,780
Yes, um, so Red Box, the DVD kiosk rental place that's been popularized by all its locations

1753
01:29:35,780 --> 01:29:43,200
and Walmarts and various supermarkets and everywhere else in between, they are now test

1754
01:29:43,200 --> 01:29:51,160
marketing, well, they have been test marketing game rentals in Reno, Nevada and Wilmington,

1755
01:29:51,160 --> 01:29:55,640
North Carolina, and they're testing them out at two dollars a piece.

1756
01:29:55,640 --> 01:29:58,640
Yeah, I've been well aware of this.

1757
01:29:58,640 --> 01:30:02,920
Something we deal with, actually, so.

1758
01:30:02,920 --> 01:30:06,600
And hopefully it's something that will launch full scale at some point.

1759
01:30:06,600 --> 01:30:11,840
They're also testing some higher price points, too, for DVD rentals, but that's another story.

1760
01:30:11,840 --> 01:30:15,260
That's a whole thing, because I hear the movie studios are pissed that they're only charging

1761
01:30:15,260 --> 01:30:21,800
a dollar for DVD rentals, because it devalues the movie, as in, as if ending up in the five

1762
01:30:21,800 --> 01:30:23,760
dollar bin at Walmart isn't devaluing your movie.

1763
01:30:23,760 --> 01:30:24,760
I mean, please get over yourself.

1764
01:30:24,760 --> 01:30:30,560
I could talk for a long time about how retarded that whole comment of them saying that it

1765
01:30:30,560 --> 01:30:34,560
devalues movies and stuff, because they're worried that people are going to go to these

1766
01:30:34,560 --> 01:30:37,720
movies and say, well, I don't have to buy your movies, you know, sell through, I'm just

1767
01:30:37,720 --> 01:30:41,000
going to go rent it from this kiosk for a dollar.

1768
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:43,880
And they figure, oh, if we take that away, then they'll go buy the DVD.

1769
01:30:43,880 --> 01:30:48,080
No, they'll actually just go rent it from someplace else for less.

1770
01:30:48,080 --> 01:30:52,400
You know, they're not going to just go, oh, well, I guess I have to go buy the DVD now

1771
01:30:52,400 --> 01:30:53,960
to watch it.

1772
01:30:53,960 --> 01:30:55,360
Or they're going to go, oh, well, I'm just going to...

1773
01:30:55,360 --> 01:30:59,240
What about Netflix, where I get it for free, pretty much, with a subscription?

1774
01:30:59,240 --> 01:31:01,000
I mean, it's retarded.

1775
01:31:01,000 --> 01:31:02,400
There are some that have jumped on board.

1776
01:31:02,400 --> 01:31:05,960
There's some, though, that they realize that they've made a mistake, but they're stubborn,

1777
01:31:05,960 --> 01:31:10,880
so they're going to stick to their guns, and that's unfortunately the case.

1778
01:31:10,880 --> 01:31:13,440
This actually, I believe, is unrelated to all that.

1779
01:31:13,440 --> 01:31:18,560
The reason why I think they're raising their rentals to two dollars is because they're

1780
01:31:18,560 --> 01:31:23,800
starting to carry more Blu-rays in there, and you can't rent a Blu-ray for a buck a

1781
01:31:23,800 --> 01:31:26,560
day and expect to make a return on your investment.

1782
01:31:26,560 --> 01:31:30,480
Yeah, that's true, too, is that they're going to lose money at that rate.

1783
01:31:30,480 --> 01:31:33,360
But still, I think it's kind of cool, though, two dollar rentals for games, I mean, that's

1784
01:31:33,360 --> 01:31:34,360
not bad.

1785
01:31:34,360 --> 01:31:35,360
That's not bad at all.

1786
01:31:35,360 --> 01:31:39,000
No, I mean, I don't rent games, really, anymore, but if I did...

1787
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:40,920
I don't either, but I should.

1788
01:31:40,920 --> 01:31:44,140
I would save a lot of money if I were smart enough to rent the games.

1789
01:31:44,140 --> 01:31:47,400
My only issue is that the nearest red box machine I can think of is at Wal-Mart, and

1790
01:31:47,400 --> 01:31:49,700
I ain't setting foot in that place.

1791
01:31:49,700 --> 01:31:52,760
But it's just like a few feet into Wal-Mart, I mean, it's like...

1792
01:31:52,760 --> 01:31:55,840
I have to get through the parking lot and all the people asking me for money.

1793
01:31:55,840 --> 01:31:58,560
Seriously, the Wal-Mart by where I live is sick.

1794
01:31:58,560 --> 01:31:59,560
You know why they also Safeway?

1795
01:31:59,560 --> 01:32:00,560
Check it out.

1796
01:32:00,560 --> 01:32:01,560
They need to nuke it.

1797
01:32:01,560 --> 01:32:03,120
I found a secret entrance into the Wal-Mart near where I live.

1798
01:32:03,120 --> 01:32:06,920
There's actually a side one by where they push the carts in that no one uses.

1799
01:32:06,920 --> 01:32:07,920
Really?

1800
01:32:07,920 --> 01:32:09,320
So I actually bypass the front door completely.

1801
01:32:09,320 --> 01:32:10,360
They don't have one like that here.

1802
01:32:10,360 --> 01:32:11,360
Just go to Safeway.

1803
01:32:11,360 --> 01:32:12,360
I'll go to Safeway.

1804
01:32:12,360 --> 01:32:13,360
Safeway's nice.

1805
01:32:13,360 --> 01:32:14,360
Yeah.

1806
01:32:14,360 --> 01:32:19,740
Which is funny, Safeway is next door to Wal-Mart, yet Safeway doesn't have that problem, because

1807
01:32:19,740 --> 01:32:22,240
Safeway hires security guards.

1808
01:32:22,240 --> 01:32:27,160
Safeway probably also doesn't want people loitering out front selling shit too, so...

1809
01:32:27,160 --> 01:32:31,360
I had people knock at my door today, two different people trying to sell me shit.

1810
01:32:31,360 --> 01:32:33,040
I hate that shit.

1811
01:32:33,040 --> 01:32:36,560
You know, someone trying to sell me the Sac B so they can get their thousand dollar scholarship.

1812
01:32:36,560 --> 01:32:37,560
I don't give a shit!

1813
01:32:37,560 --> 01:32:40,360
Do you know how many of those kids have come to my door in like the past couple weeks?

1814
01:32:40,360 --> 01:32:43,840
Because when I was home sick with the swine flu, I swear to God, like three of those people

1815
01:32:43,840 --> 01:32:44,840
came by the house.

1816
01:32:44,840 --> 01:32:48,600
I'm like, I'm gonna cough on you, and then you're really gonna have something to fundraise

1817
01:32:48,600 --> 01:32:49,600
for.

1818
01:32:49,600 --> 01:32:51,600
And then like, do you have any cans?

1819
01:32:51,600 --> 01:32:52,600
No!

1820
01:32:52,600 --> 01:32:53,600
I don't have any cans!

1821
01:32:53,600 --> 01:32:55,000
Go away!

1822
01:32:55,000 --> 01:32:58,400
People dig through the recycle bin at my house.

1823
01:32:58,400 --> 01:33:02,520
It's kinda, like, I gotta watch what I throw in there.

1824
01:33:02,520 --> 01:33:03,520
It's kinda freaky.

1825
01:33:03,520 --> 01:33:04,520
People suck.

1826
01:33:04,520 --> 01:33:09,360
Anyhow, Toa Gak in our chat says, threaten to shoot them if they don't get off your property.

1827
01:33:09,360 --> 01:33:11,520
Sadly, it's not that easy.

1828
01:33:11,520 --> 01:33:16,860
DarkTattooia is pointing me to the PeopleOfWalmart.com website, which, by the way, love.

1829
01:33:16,860 --> 01:33:17,860
Love that site.

1830
01:33:17,860 --> 01:33:18,860
Hilarity.

1831
01:33:18,860 --> 01:33:19,860
Great time waster.

1832
01:33:19,860 --> 01:33:20,860
Yes, great time waster.

1833
01:33:20,860 --> 01:33:23,000
The other person wants to know, is Walmart that bad in California?

1834
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:24,440
Depends where you are.

1835
01:33:24,440 --> 01:33:25,560
There's some really nice ones.

1836
01:33:25,560 --> 01:33:27,680
There's some really nice Walmarts I will go to.

1837
01:33:27,680 --> 01:33:32,600
I like the, well, Walmart for me also, when I first moved out here, I could not find a

1838
01:33:32,600 --> 01:33:33,600
Walmart.

1839
01:33:33,600 --> 01:33:35,360
We had to go to, like, Elberta to find a Walmart.

1840
01:33:35,360 --> 01:33:37,560
Yeah, they're only new as of the past, you know, ten years, as long as you've been here.

1841
01:33:37,560 --> 01:33:39,120
Well, now we have the supercenters now.

1842
01:33:39,120 --> 01:33:41,120
Yeah, and honestly, that makes the difference to me.

1843
01:33:41,120 --> 01:33:42,800
If it's a supercenter, it's usually really nice.

1844
01:33:42,800 --> 01:33:43,800
If it's not, they'll go there.

1845
01:33:43,800 --> 01:33:47,040
Well, for the longest time, we couldn't have them out here because of actually zoning laws

1846
01:33:47,040 --> 01:33:50,640
regarding grocery stores, where you could have a certain number of grocery stores within

1847
01:33:50,640 --> 01:33:53,880
a certain radius of each other.

1848
01:33:53,880 --> 01:33:56,760
But I think they since lived through that, because I saw them building the one on Antelope

1849
01:33:56,760 --> 01:34:01,800
way back, well, here near where I live, when I would come home from work, and now it's

1850
01:34:01,800 --> 01:34:02,800
here, and I love it.

1851
01:34:02,800 --> 01:34:06,760
And whenever, actually, it's kind of funny, I just stayed in there for two hours when

1852
01:34:06,760 --> 01:34:10,200
they first opened it, because I was so homesick.

1853
01:34:10,200 --> 01:34:12,680
When I get homesick, I go to Walmart.

1854
01:34:12,680 --> 01:34:17,000
Honestly though, why would I ever go to Walmart when there's a Target just a couple blocks

1855
01:34:17,000 --> 01:34:22,320
away that's brand spanking new, and nice, and even has groceries now?

1856
01:34:22,320 --> 01:34:24,280
It's Uber Target, and I love it.

1857
01:34:24,280 --> 01:34:28,440
Actually, Walmart does have better prices for certain things, like, okay, I know you're

1858
01:34:28,440 --> 01:34:30,320
not a chick, but...

1859
01:34:30,320 --> 01:34:31,320
Tampons?

1860
01:34:31,320 --> 01:34:35,320
No, actually, the hair dye that I buy actually get cheaper.

1861
01:34:35,320 --> 01:34:40,240
A lot of the stuff that I get actually, I tend to get a whole lot cheaper than action

1862
01:34:40,240 --> 01:34:44,360
figures.

1863
01:34:44,360 --> 01:34:49,880
Where else can I go to get, you know, a bag of baby spinach, and then run it over and

1864
01:34:49,880 --> 01:34:55,560
buy some Equate brand NyQuil stuff?

1865
01:34:55,560 --> 01:34:57,280
Hitstun is mentioning Costco.

1866
01:34:57,280 --> 01:34:59,000
Actually, it was Marissa that first said it.

1867
01:34:59,000 --> 01:35:01,440
Screw Sam's Club, Costco for the win.

1868
01:35:01,440 --> 01:35:06,360
Costco's pretty awesome if you need, like, 15 of something.

1869
01:35:06,360 --> 01:35:10,600
Because seriously, like, I think a great arrangement would be to have, like, a really good friend

1870
01:35:10,600 --> 01:35:13,600
that you can go, like, shopping at Costco with for your necessities, and then split

1871
01:35:13,600 --> 01:35:15,400
what you buy in half.

1872
01:35:15,400 --> 01:35:16,400
You know what?

1873
01:35:16,400 --> 01:35:17,400
It would be a smart arrangement.

1874
01:35:17,400 --> 01:35:18,400
You know what?

1875
01:35:18,400 --> 01:35:19,400
We do.

1876
01:35:19,400 --> 01:35:20,400
Well, we actually did just get a Costco membership, but we had a friend.

1877
01:35:20,400 --> 01:35:23,760
Actually, our landlord, but he's a buddy of ours, has a Costco membership, and then Dan

1878
01:35:23,760 --> 01:35:28,640
is our friend Julie's complimentary spouse.

1879
01:35:28,640 --> 01:35:29,640
Nice.

1880
01:35:29,640 --> 01:35:33,720
I actually got pissed off over that the first time, though.

1881
01:35:33,720 --> 01:35:34,720
Yeah, yeah.

1882
01:35:34,720 --> 01:35:36,440
But I think we have our own membership now, but still.

1883
01:35:36,440 --> 01:35:39,560
I like Costco quite a bit, actually.

1884
01:35:39,560 --> 01:35:43,360
All joking aside about the bulk items, they do have really good deals on, like, TVs and,

1885
01:35:43,360 --> 01:35:44,520
you know, the high-end stuff.

1886
01:35:44,520 --> 01:35:46,200
Like, I got my TV at Costco.

1887
01:35:46,200 --> 01:35:49,080
Well, I told you about what happened with ours, right?

1888
01:35:49,080 --> 01:35:55,040
Well, keep in mind, with Costco, you can return anything anytime without your receipt.

1889
01:35:55,040 --> 01:35:56,040
You can just go.

1890
01:35:56,040 --> 01:35:57,600
It'll be on your membership card.

1891
01:35:57,600 --> 01:35:58,600
Yeah.

1892
01:35:58,600 --> 01:36:04,180
So we took, we had our old 50-inch widescreen TV, and we actually took it back to exchange

1893
01:36:04,180 --> 01:36:07,880
it for, you know, something that was equivalent.

1894
01:36:07,880 --> 01:36:11,440
And we actually now have a 52-inch LCD widescreen.

1895
01:36:11,440 --> 01:36:15,960
So because we could exchange it for anything equivalent, and it was the only equivalent

1896
01:36:15,960 --> 01:36:17,780
they had, our old model is not made anymore.

1897
01:36:17,780 --> 01:36:21,840
They do have a great return policy at Target, or not Target, at Costco.

1898
01:36:21,840 --> 01:36:24,520
I did have a TV break, and I took it back, and they took it back.

1899
01:36:24,520 --> 01:36:25,520
Amazing.

1900
01:36:25,520 --> 01:36:27,840
Anyhow, I don't know how we got from Redbox to Costco, but we did.

1901
01:36:27,840 --> 01:36:28,840
So there you go.

1902
01:36:28,840 --> 01:36:33,960
World of Warcraft, moving on to this crack of a game, World of Warcraft, World of War

1903
01:36:33,960 --> 01:36:34,960
crack.

1904
01:36:34,960 --> 01:36:35,960
I'm addicted.

1905
01:36:35,960 --> 01:36:36,960
What can I say?

1906
01:36:36,960 --> 01:36:37,960
It's fun.

1907
01:36:37,960 --> 01:36:38,960
But did you hear that it got beaten?

1908
01:36:38,960 --> 01:36:41,760
Yes, somebody beat the World of Warcraft.

1909
01:36:41,760 --> 01:36:46,520
And of course, they live in Taiwan, and the character's name is Little Gray, if you translate

1910
01:36:46,520 --> 01:36:47,520
the name.

1911
01:36:47,520 --> 01:36:49,320
They've beat the World of Warcraft.

1912
01:36:49,320 --> 01:36:50,480
What do I mean by beat?

1913
01:36:50,480 --> 01:36:53,720
No, I don't mean they beat the final raid in the game, because then a lot of people

1914
01:36:53,720 --> 01:36:55,080
have beat it, if that's the case.

1915
01:36:55,080 --> 01:37:02,680
No, they have gotten every single achievement in World of Warcraft, all 986.

1916
01:37:02,680 --> 01:37:04,680
Someone has no fucking life.

1917
01:37:04,680 --> 01:37:05,680
Here's my thought.

1918
01:37:05,680 --> 01:37:07,320
I bet multiple people are splitting this account.

1919
01:37:07,320 --> 01:37:09,160
I bet multiple people contributed to this.

1920
01:37:09,160 --> 01:37:11,000
It probably wasn't just one person.

1921
01:37:11,000 --> 01:37:15,600
It's still an impressive achievement, though, but at the same time, time to go outside,

1922
01:37:15,600 --> 01:37:18,280
because there's some achievements in there that are crazy.

1923
01:37:18,280 --> 01:37:22,720
One of them is that you have to get exalted with Aldor, and then you have to go all the

1924
01:37:22,720 --> 01:37:27,360
way down to Hated and get exalted with Scryer.

1925
01:37:27,360 --> 01:37:29,240
That means nothing to people that don't play WoW.

1926
01:37:29,240 --> 01:37:30,680
It means nothing to me.

1927
01:37:30,680 --> 01:37:31,680
It takes a lot.

1928
01:37:31,680 --> 01:37:32,680
It's a lot of fucking grinding.

1929
01:37:32,680 --> 01:37:33,680
Let's just leave it like that.

1930
01:37:33,680 --> 01:37:34,680
You know what?

1931
01:37:34,680 --> 01:37:36,120
It's like trying to gain one level in Final Fantasy XI.

1932
01:37:36,120 --> 01:37:38,400
It's a lot of fucking grinding.

1933
01:37:38,400 --> 01:37:40,760
That's a great analogy.

1934
01:37:40,760 --> 01:37:42,360
That's a fantastic analogy.

1935
01:37:42,360 --> 01:37:44,520
Yes, and it's accurate, too.

1936
01:37:44,520 --> 01:37:50,960
Because, I mean, for me, I can't stand to play with more than two people at a time,

1937
01:37:50,960 --> 01:37:54,040
because I'm like, you're going too fast!

1938
01:37:54,040 --> 01:37:59,120
So just doing all of that would be like, eeee, wince.

1939
01:37:59,120 --> 01:38:03,740
I will say, though, despite all the crap I give Final Fantasy XI years out, I am super,

1940
01:38:03,740 --> 01:38:06,240
super excited for Final Fantasy XIV.

1941
01:38:06,240 --> 01:38:09,960
Like I'm already seeing that 2010 will be the year I finally quit WoW, because we'll

1942
01:38:09,960 --> 01:38:12,880
have Final Fantasy XIV and we'll have Star Trek Online.

1943
01:38:12,880 --> 01:38:16,040
Star Trek Online is going to completely murder any free time I have.

1944
01:38:16,040 --> 01:38:17,040
I know.

1945
01:38:17,040 --> 01:38:18,040
That's what I'm looking at, too.

1946
01:38:18,040 --> 01:38:19,040
I'm going to command a fucking ship.

1947
01:38:19,040 --> 01:38:21,920
Did you see what they did to the Borg?

1948
01:38:21,920 --> 01:38:26,280
I've been very good about not looking at any previews for it, because I want to poop my

1949
01:38:26,280 --> 01:38:31,080
pants from shock and awe the first day I play it.

1950
01:38:31,080 --> 01:38:37,320
I think that I farted a little bit.

1951
01:38:37,320 --> 01:38:42,800
To use your analogy, Rob.

1952
01:38:42,800 --> 01:38:44,280
Don't pin that analogy on me.

1953
01:38:44,280 --> 01:38:45,280
That's all you.

1954
01:38:45,280 --> 01:38:47,720
No, you're the one who said you were going to poop your pants.

1955
01:38:47,720 --> 01:38:49,520
I just used your same analogy.

1956
01:38:49,520 --> 01:38:50,920
Alright, fine.

1957
01:38:50,920 --> 01:38:52,840
They did cool stuff.

1958
01:38:52,840 --> 01:38:56,520
So the Borg made you shard a little bit.

1959
01:38:56,520 --> 01:39:02,360
Anyway, like some of the stuff that they were talking about is like they were trying to

1960
01:39:02,360 --> 01:39:06,120
make it to where you could not go back from assimilation, that like they replace your

1961
01:39:06,120 --> 01:39:07,120
stomach.

1962
01:39:07,120 --> 01:39:08,120
Wow.

1963
01:39:08,120 --> 01:39:11,560
Because you don't really need to eat when you have a regeneration cycle.

1964
01:39:11,560 --> 01:39:16,760
I'm like, wow, these people are geeky on a level that is far beyond my comprehension.

1965
01:39:16,760 --> 01:39:18,700
So the Borg won't sh- never mind.

1966
01:39:18,700 --> 01:39:20,320
They can't shit.

1967
01:39:20,320 --> 01:39:21,320
I wasn't going to go there.

1968
01:39:21,320 --> 01:39:24,160
Unless they're going to throw up some energy at you or something.

1969
01:39:24,160 --> 01:39:28,800
They're going to fart sparks.

1970
01:39:28,800 --> 01:39:32,800
Resistance is futile.

1971
01:39:32,800 --> 01:39:35,600
Pooped!

1972
01:39:35,600 --> 01:39:39,720
This was the moment when OLR got flushed down the toilet.

1973
01:39:39,720 --> 01:39:44,600
That's the moment when the episode literally and figuratively went down the-

1974
01:39:44,600 --> 01:39:45,600
Hey, I see a shark.

1975
01:39:45,600 --> 01:39:46,600
Let's jump it.

1976
01:39:46,600 --> 01:39:47,600
Hey!

1977
01:39:47,600 --> 01:39:52,880
Rest in peace, Orange Launch Radio, 2002-2009.

1978
01:39:52,880 --> 01:39:56,760
Alright, let's move on with some more gaming news.

1979
01:39:56,760 --> 01:39:59,520
Jamie, can you take us in a non-poopy direction, please?

1980
01:39:59,520 --> 01:40:04,200
Um, sorry, I'm still laughing my ass off.

1981
01:40:04,200 --> 01:40:06,320
I'm laughing my ass off, so no more pooping.

1982
01:40:06,320 --> 01:40:08,480
Are you laughing at what Salacious Pop is saying in chat?

1983
01:40:08,480 --> 01:40:09,480
I'm not looking.

1984
01:40:09,480 --> 01:40:15,000
They poop Sound Blaster cards from 1998 and laugh at you when they crash your Win 95.

1985
01:40:15,000 --> 01:40:17,640
I lolled.

1986
01:40:17,640 --> 01:40:19,400
That's pretty, pretty damn funny.

1987
01:40:19,400 --> 01:40:23,200
Oh, anyway, okay, so, how about some Tatsunoko vs. Capcom news?

1988
01:40:23,200 --> 01:40:24,200
Yes, please.

1989
01:40:24,200 --> 01:40:26,640
Because Tatsunoko vs. Capcom is sexy.

1990
01:40:26,640 --> 01:40:36,640
Um, so yeah, actually, um, there is something on one of the Mad Cat's, um, employees' flicker

1991
01:40:36,640 --> 01:40:45,440
that is a Tatsunoko vs. Capcom fighting stick, so that you can actually, uh, play fighting

1992
01:40:45,440 --> 01:40:50,560
games without having to contort your fingers to actually use the damn Wii controller, even

1993
01:40:50,560 --> 01:40:51,560
the classic controller.

1994
01:40:51,560 --> 01:40:53,560
I was going to say, the classic controller is not terrible.

1995
01:40:53,560 --> 01:40:55,280
But it's not great.

1996
01:40:55,280 --> 01:40:59,880
It's like trying to play fighting games on the SNES, unless you were dealing with something

1997
01:40:59,880 --> 01:41:00,880
with only four buttons.

1998
01:41:00,880 --> 01:41:04,240
But I actually, I was quite fond of Street Fighter II on the SNES, you know?

1999
01:41:04,240 --> 01:41:07,920
So it was like, well, keep in mind, when I bought my SNES, the first game I went out

2000
01:41:07,920 --> 01:41:12,080
and got, well, besides Kirby's Avalanche, was Super Street Fighter II.

2001
01:41:12,080 --> 01:41:16,320
Now, I'm with Dark Tetsuya, though, that would be awesome to have even for virtual console

2002
01:41:16,320 --> 01:41:18,200
games or a few arcade games.

2003
01:41:18,200 --> 01:41:25,680
Well, anyway, the theory is that it could be possible that it's going to, uh, be a bundle,

2004
01:41:25,680 --> 01:41:31,040
like a normal and then arcade bundle, um, like, uh, Street Fighter IV had.

2005
01:41:31,040 --> 01:41:33,320
So, and it looks, it looks really nice.

2006
01:41:33,320 --> 01:41:34,320
I hope so.

2007
01:41:34,320 --> 01:41:38,160
I mean, because honestly, you know what's funny is that playing fighting games at home,

2008
01:41:38,160 --> 01:41:44,280
I actually do prefer to play on a good controller over playing it on a joystick just because

2009
01:41:44,280 --> 01:41:47,760
of, um, some of my hand problems.

2010
01:41:47,760 --> 01:41:52,080
But I would, I would seriously, I would seriously get this.

2011
01:41:52,080 --> 01:41:53,080
It's sexy.

2012
01:41:53,080 --> 01:41:57,160
There's a, everybody else's face is covered except for, you know, that crack coach in

2013
01:41:57,160 --> 01:41:58,160
Lee.

2014
01:41:58,160 --> 01:42:03,880
But right at the very top of it is Owashi no Ken, and he, he is so cool.

2015
01:42:03,880 --> 01:42:09,080
I'm kind of surprised at all the love that Tatsunoko versus Capcom is getting, um, getting

2016
01:42:09,080 --> 01:42:10,240
from Capcom.

2017
01:42:10,240 --> 01:42:14,040
I kind of assumed that they were going to release this, like they were kind of throwing

2018
01:42:14,040 --> 01:42:17,680
us a fricking bone, but it really seems like they're giving this an Uber release here.

2019
01:42:17,680 --> 01:42:18,680
Like they're really trying.

2020
01:42:18,680 --> 01:42:24,160
Keep in mind, I mean, yeah, maybe not many people over here in the US have heard of Kagaki

2021
01:42:24,160 --> 01:42:25,160
Ninja Taigajamon, right?

2022
01:42:25,160 --> 01:42:31,040
But they've heard of Battle of the Planets, they've heard of G-Force, they've heard of

2023
01:42:31,040 --> 01:42:33,120
even Eagle Riders.

2024
01:42:33,120 --> 01:42:39,200
I mean, for all the anime fans, Gatchaman, the OAVs got a release, um, Kashan got an

2025
01:42:39,200 --> 01:42:45,920
OAV release, um, Hurricane Polymer, uh, Tekkaman, all of those, I mean, these are names that

2026
01:42:45,920 --> 01:42:51,840
are known in a lot of the, the, uh, anime slash video game industry, I guess, or, you

2027
01:42:51,840 --> 01:42:52,840
know, fan base.

2028
01:42:52,840 --> 01:42:53,840
I'll give you that.

2029
01:42:53,840 --> 01:42:57,560
I mean, this is definitely is catered to the anime convention going crowd, but there's

2030
01:42:57,560 --> 01:43:00,680
a damn lot of anime convention going people, you know what I mean?

2031
01:43:00,680 --> 01:43:03,400
And there's enough people that would take interest in a game like this.

2032
01:43:03,400 --> 01:43:04,800
Do you see this evil book?

2033
01:43:04,800 --> 01:43:05,800
Um, Amano.

2034
01:43:05,800 --> 01:43:08,000
I have the giant book of Amano.

2035
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:12,880
He did the character designs for Gatchaman and a lot of the early Tachinoko characters.

2036
01:43:12,880 --> 01:43:15,560
So I'll find it and put the picture up.

2037
01:43:15,560 --> 01:43:17,120
All right.

2038
01:43:17,120 --> 01:43:18,120
Sounds good.

2039
01:43:18,120 --> 01:43:19,120
Oh, here we go.

2040
01:43:19,120 --> 01:43:20,120
I opened right to it.

2041
01:43:20,120 --> 01:43:21,120
What'd you open to?

2042
01:43:21,120 --> 01:43:22,120
What are you showing me?

2043
01:43:22,120 --> 01:43:23,120
Oh, those are, those are pretty.

2044
01:43:23,120 --> 01:43:24,120
Oh, some of the characters.

2045
01:43:24,120 --> 01:43:25,120
I see.

2046
01:43:25,120 --> 01:43:26,120
Here.

2047
01:43:26,120 --> 01:43:27,120
Oh, okay.

2048
01:43:27,120 --> 01:43:28,120
Very cool.

2049
01:43:28,120 --> 01:43:29,120
This makes for great radio, by the way.

2050
01:43:29,120 --> 01:43:30,120
Can I just point out?

2051
01:43:30,120 --> 01:43:31,120
Okay.

2052
01:43:31,120 --> 01:43:32,120
Very cool.

2053
01:43:32,120 --> 01:43:33,120
Take a picture.

2054
01:43:33,120 --> 01:43:34,120
I'm gonna put a picture up.

2055
01:43:34,120 --> 01:43:35,120
All right.

2056
01:43:35,120 --> 01:43:36,120
Meanwhile, Loki, let's move on with some more gaming news.

2057
01:43:36,120 --> 01:43:37,120
Yes.

2058
01:43:37,120 --> 01:43:41,240
There's a new Xbox Live Arcade game going to be coming out March 2010.

2059
01:43:41,240 --> 01:43:45,840
It's called Scourge Project, and it's a third person shooter game.

2060
01:43:45,840 --> 01:43:50,060
It will be coming out on Steam, Xbox Live Arcade, and the PlayStation Network.

2061
01:43:50,060 --> 01:43:53,420
And what's kind of notable about it is it actually looks really good.

2062
01:43:53,420 --> 01:43:56,560
And it's being powered by the Unreal 3 engine.

2063
01:43:56,560 --> 01:44:00,860
It's kind of a co-op shooter game where they've got four different storylines with each player,

2064
01:44:00,860 --> 01:44:05,740
you know, being able to, in the team, you can play as four different players, and then

2065
01:44:05,740 --> 01:44:10,000
you can have a unique perspective on the story with each player that you play as.

2066
01:44:10,000 --> 01:44:15,560
And they've also got online deathmatch for up to 16 players as well.

2067
01:44:15,560 --> 01:44:18,720
And I don't know, it looks pretty awesome.

2068
01:44:18,720 --> 01:44:22,240
Really high quality for even, like, an Xbox Live Arcade game.

2069
01:44:22,240 --> 01:44:27,280
You know, kind of almost something that I would expect from a console, just a standard

2070
01:44:27,280 --> 01:44:28,860
disc release.

2071
01:44:28,860 --> 01:44:31,680
But something to definitely look forward to.

2072
01:44:31,680 --> 01:44:35,640
It was actually announced back in 2007, but I guess it took them this long to actually

2073
01:44:35,640 --> 01:44:37,000
get it finished.

2074
01:44:37,000 --> 01:44:39,400
But eh, whatever.

2075
01:44:39,400 --> 01:44:44,960
And like I said, it's scheduled to arrive March 2010, so it's going to be pretty awesome.

2076
01:44:44,960 --> 01:44:45,960
All right.

2077
01:44:45,960 --> 01:44:51,600
Well, something you can get much sooner than March 2010 is some more crap for your Xbox

2078
01:44:51,600 --> 01:44:52,600
Live avatar.

2079
01:44:52,600 --> 01:44:53,600
That's right.

2080
01:44:53,600 --> 01:44:57,420
If you love dressing up your virtual Barbie with, you know, spending nickels and dimes

2081
01:44:57,420 --> 01:45:01,520
here and there on new outfits and things like that, guess what you can get now very soon?

2082
01:45:01,520 --> 01:45:02,520
Animals!

2083
01:45:02,520 --> 01:45:05,200
Cute fuzzy widow animals!

2084
01:45:05,200 --> 01:45:06,200
That's right.

2085
01:45:06,200 --> 01:45:09,000
You can get a dog or a pug dog or a dog in a bag.

2086
01:45:09,000 --> 01:45:10,680
I'm assuming that's like a Paris Hilton dog.

2087
01:45:10,680 --> 01:45:11,680
Bag dog.

2088
01:45:11,680 --> 01:45:12,680
Yeah, bag dog.

2089
01:45:12,680 --> 01:45:16,920
You can get a cat, a Siamese cat, a long haired cat, or if you're not a cat or dog person,

2090
01:45:16,920 --> 01:45:23,000
you can get a goldfish, a guinea pig, monkey, bird, snake, or you can get a pony.

2091
01:45:23,000 --> 01:45:24,000
That's right.

2092
01:45:24,000 --> 01:45:27,520
If you've always wanted a pony, you can now have one for the low, low cost of 240 Microsoft

2093
01:45:27,520 --> 01:45:28,700
points.

2094
01:45:28,700 --> 01:45:30,920
In the real world, that's $3.

2095
01:45:30,920 --> 01:45:33,520
$3 for a virtual pet.

2096
01:45:33,520 --> 01:45:34,680
That's your thing.

2097
01:45:34,680 --> 01:45:35,680
Have fun.

2098
01:45:35,680 --> 01:45:37,400
What can I do with this virtual pet?

2099
01:45:37,400 --> 01:45:38,400
Um,

2100
01:45:38,400 --> 01:45:43,400
Or is it just going to be like a handbag, like, you know, I have the dog.

2101
01:45:43,400 --> 01:45:48,760
Well you can see a little picture of the avatar with the dog and I guess they, they pet it.

2102
01:45:48,760 --> 01:45:49,760
Um,

2103
01:45:49,760 --> 01:45:50,760
Can I have multiple animals?

2104
01:45:50,760 --> 01:45:54,600
The dog probably barks, but not really because I don't think the avatars make sound.

2105
01:45:54,600 --> 01:45:55,600
They should allow you to have multiple animals.

2106
01:45:55,600 --> 01:45:59,280
Like, I want to be a virtual cat woman in the game and have like 800 cats.

2107
01:45:59,280 --> 01:46:01,440
Did you just say you want to be a virtual cat woman?

2108
01:46:01,440 --> 01:46:02,560
Did I hear that correctly?

2109
01:46:02,560 --> 01:46:03,560
Cat lady.

2110
01:46:03,560 --> 01:46:06,400
Not cat woman as in like, you know.

2111
01:46:06,400 --> 01:46:09,960
Just hearing you talking about your dream of being a cat lady is kind of amusing to

2112
01:46:09,960 --> 01:46:10,960
me.

2113
01:46:10,960 --> 01:46:13,920
It's like an avatar because you like, you flip over and see what your friends are doing

2114
01:46:13,920 --> 01:46:22,080
and all of a sudden it's like, what the fuck is, is there a person under all those cats?

2115
01:46:22,080 --> 01:46:23,080
Oh, I want to see.

2116
01:46:23,080 --> 01:46:24,080
I see.

2117
01:46:24,080 --> 01:46:25,080
You don't want to be like Michelle Pfeiffer.

2118
01:46:25,080 --> 01:46:26,080
No, no, no.

2119
01:46:26,080 --> 01:46:27,080
God.

2120
01:46:27,080 --> 01:46:31,200
You want to be the lady that lives in the shoe that has 500 cats that you hear about.

2121
01:46:31,200 --> 01:46:32,200
What's in the shoe?

2122
01:46:32,200 --> 01:46:33,200
You hear about.

2123
01:46:33,200 --> 01:46:34,200
She has so many cats.

2124
01:46:34,200 --> 01:46:35,200
She didn't know what to do.

2125
01:46:35,200 --> 01:46:39,440
I've maybe combined a couple of things there, but she's the lady you see on the news that,

2126
01:46:39,440 --> 01:46:44,360
you know, she died in the house and all the cats like, you know, ate her and then, you

2127
01:46:44,360 --> 01:46:47,520
know, suddenly the SPCA doesn't know what to do with all these cats, so they're trying

2128
01:46:47,520 --> 01:46:50,200
to find home, homes for 500 cats.

2129
01:46:50,200 --> 01:46:52,240
500 human eating cats.

2130
01:46:52,240 --> 01:46:53,240
Exactly.

2131
01:46:53,240 --> 01:46:55,840
I can find a home for them.

2132
01:46:55,840 --> 01:47:00,160
Our prison system.

2133
01:47:00,160 --> 01:47:01,160
But they're adorable.

2134
01:47:01,160 --> 01:47:07,560
By the way, I just want to point out, people are actually going to spend money on this.

2135
01:47:07,560 --> 01:47:08,560
That's right.

2136
01:47:08,560 --> 01:47:12,000
People will spend $3 so that they can have a cutesy little pet.

2137
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:13,000
Here's my problem.

2138
01:47:13,000 --> 01:47:14,000
It just goes to you.

2139
01:47:14,000 --> 01:47:15,000
I want to make a point.

2140
01:47:15,000 --> 01:47:16,000
This is very important.

2141
01:47:16,000 --> 01:47:19,320
This just proves my point, and I've said this before on the show.

2142
01:47:19,320 --> 01:47:26,880
This will make money because America loves cats.

2143
01:47:26,880 --> 01:47:29,040
But the cat they have is the Siamese cat.

2144
01:47:29,040 --> 01:47:30,040
That's unacceptable.

2145
01:47:30,040 --> 01:47:31,040
There's more.

2146
01:47:31,040 --> 01:47:32,040
There's other cats, too.

2147
01:47:32,040 --> 01:47:33,040
No, there's just the Siamese cat.

2148
01:47:33,040 --> 01:47:34,040
There's the long-haired cat.

2149
01:47:34,040 --> 01:47:35,620
Oh, well, I don't have a long-haired cat.

2150
01:47:35,620 --> 01:47:37,440
I want a cat that looks like my cat.

2151
01:47:37,440 --> 01:47:41,240
I have Shermie that sheds enough for 50 cats.

2152
01:47:41,240 --> 01:47:46,880
By the way, the Final Fight Guy pictures are up at the Orange Zones Radio Gallery.

2153
01:47:46,880 --> 01:47:52,020
I want a guy cat that wears an orange jumpsuit and karate kicks intruders.

2154
01:47:52,020 --> 01:47:54,080
That's what I want.

2155
01:47:54,080 --> 01:47:57,320
That I might pay $3 for.

2156
01:47:57,320 --> 01:47:59,200
Whatever.

2157
01:47:59,200 --> 01:48:00,200
It's your money.

2158
01:48:00,200 --> 01:48:01,720
Spend it on whatever makes you happy.

2159
01:48:01,720 --> 01:48:02,720
That's what I say.

2160
01:48:02,720 --> 01:48:06,720
Hey, now's the part of the show that we're going to get to the mailbag, and we're going

2161
01:48:06,720 --> 01:48:10,080
to open up the old mailbag and see what's in there and read some emails.

2162
01:48:10,080 --> 01:48:11,080
Although, I don't know if we...

2163
01:48:11,080 --> 01:48:12,760
At last, I went in there before the show started.

2164
01:48:12,760 --> 01:48:13,760
We didn't have a damn thing.

2165
01:48:13,760 --> 01:48:14,760
We got two things, Rob.

2166
01:48:14,760 --> 01:48:15,760
Woo!

2167
01:48:15,760 --> 01:48:16,760
Jack and shit.

2168
01:48:16,760 --> 01:48:17,760
Oh, I thought we actually had an email.

2169
01:48:17,760 --> 01:48:18,760
Nope.

2170
01:48:18,760 --> 01:48:21,080
Well, part of that probably has to do with the fact that we didn't get a show last week

2171
01:48:21,080 --> 01:48:23,700
up because of internal problems, so big whoops.

2172
01:48:23,700 --> 01:48:29,520
This will serve as a reminder, though, that you can always email our show mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.

2173
01:48:29,520 --> 01:48:35,000
Funny how that works, that sometimes we get like 100 Twitters like we got tonight, and

2174
01:48:35,000 --> 01:48:36,000
then no emails.

2175
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:39,360
And then some nights we'll have like 50 emails and no Twitters or something else.

2176
01:48:39,360 --> 01:48:41,800
All right, so we'll roll over.

2177
01:48:41,800 --> 01:48:42,800
And don't email us now.

2178
01:48:42,800 --> 01:48:43,800
It's going to do no good.

2179
01:48:43,800 --> 01:48:44,800
You missed your chance.

2180
01:48:44,800 --> 01:48:45,800
So we'll roll them over to next week.

2181
01:48:45,800 --> 01:48:47,440
So there you go.

2182
01:48:47,440 --> 01:48:50,320
But there's always time for ranting.

2183
01:48:50,320 --> 01:48:53,920
And usually right after the mailbag, we take a moment to rant about something, and this

2184
01:48:53,920 --> 01:48:54,920
week's no different.

2185
01:48:54,920 --> 01:49:12,760
We had the FUs of the Week.

2186
01:49:12,760 --> 01:49:17,520
We have a story tonight to inspire the FUs, just to get your ranting warmed up a little

2187
01:49:17,520 --> 01:49:18,520
bit.

2188
01:49:18,520 --> 01:49:27,240
And that is that a Florida father apparently was arrested and thrown in a slammer for getting

2189
01:49:27,240 --> 01:49:34,360
high, gaming all night long, and then falling asleep on his seven-month-old daughter, which

2190
01:49:34,360 --> 01:49:36,880
suffocated the poor thing to death.

2191
01:49:36,880 --> 01:49:40,080
His name, Emanuel Lawrence, 30.

2192
01:49:40,080 --> 01:49:45,200
And he finished a marathon game session at 6 a.m., and he laid her on the bed next to

2193
01:49:45,200 --> 01:49:47,440
him, rolled over, and dot, dot, dot.

2194
01:49:47,440 --> 01:49:50,120
I don't need to describe what else happened.

2195
01:49:50,120 --> 01:49:52,120
This makes me angry for two reasons.

2196
01:49:52,120 --> 01:49:56,240
One, I think it's pretty obvious he was an idiot.

2197
01:49:56,240 --> 01:50:01,320
Two, I'm seeing this on game blogs, and with all due respect to the lovely people that

2198
01:50:01,320 --> 01:50:05,400
work very hard on game blogs, this story has nothing to do with gaming, and it shouldn't

2199
01:50:05,400 --> 01:50:08,240
... This guy's an idiot.

2200
01:50:08,240 --> 01:50:09,240
That's the problem.

2201
01:50:09,240 --> 01:50:13,320
I mean, the fact that he was gaming all night long, he could have just been easily watching

2202
01:50:13,320 --> 01:50:15,240
movies or doing something else.

2203
01:50:15,240 --> 01:50:18,520
It has nothing to do with games, so don't run it on the game blogs, because it just

2204
01:50:18,520 --> 01:50:23,400
supports that notion that somehow it was connected to the games, when we all know it wasn't.

2205
01:50:23,400 --> 01:50:25,800
He was just a stupid, stupid head.

2206
01:50:25,800 --> 01:50:27,740
A stupid, stupid head.

2207
01:50:27,740 --> 01:50:31,120
And for that, he can go live with the 500 human-eating cats, for all I care.

2208
01:50:31,120 --> 01:50:34,560
Dark Soccer, your FUs of the Week, please.

2209
01:50:34,560 --> 01:50:38,520
FU to the wimpy California people.

2210
01:50:38,520 --> 01:50:40,760
It's just a little snow.

2211
01:50:40,760 --> 01:50:43,880
If you really don't... I'm excited.

2212
01:50:43,880 --> 01:50:44,920
I'm not really excited either.

2213
01:50:44,920 --> 01:50:47,240
I actually feel really indifferent about the whole thing.

2214
01:50:47,240 --> 01:50:52,600
I'm just like... Well, I suppose it's novel, but at the same time, I'm like, dude, if you're

2215
01:50:52,600 --> 01:50:55,720
afraid of people on the road, don't go out.

2216
01:50:55,720 --> 01:50:57,840
If you have to go to work, drive safely.

2217
01:50:57,840 --> 01:50:58,840
Stick to the slow lane.

2218
01:50:58,840 --> 01:51:00,840
I'm going to call in snow to work tomorrow.

2219
01:51:00,840 --> 01:51:03,280
Well, they also sent us that warning.

2220
01:51:03,280 --> 01:51:07,100
And by the way, thank you for sending me the warning while I'm in the middle of doing really

2221
01:51:07,100 --> 01:51:08,100
good stitches.

2222
01:51:08,100 --> 01:51:09,800
And also, fuck this hat.

2223
01:51:09,800 --> 01:51:11,200
Hi, husband!

2224
01:51:11,200 --> 01:51:13,240
Low-key, your FUs of the Week, please.

2225
01:51:13,240 --> 01:51:14,240
My husband just arrived.

2226
01:51:14,240 --> 01:51:18,360
Um, FU to people trying to sell me shit at my house.

2227
01:51:18,360 --> 01:51:22,840
I hate hearing the doorbell ring and going to the door and not recognizing the person.

2228
01:51:22,840 --> 01:51:26,200
I always assume that maybe it's a kid that threw a ball into our backyard or something

2229
01:51:26,200 --> 01:51:30,820
like that, and the dumb me answers the door, and it's always someone trying to sell shit

2230
01:51:30,820 --> 01:51:34,600
or someone that wants cams for me to donate to them for shit.

2231
01:51:34,600 --> 01:51:37,480
I don't have your fucking... Are you sure you don't want a subscription to the SACB?

2232
01:51:37,480 --> 01:51:38,480
No, I don't want a subscription.

2233
01:51:38,480 --> 01:51:40,480
Because if you don't subscribe, I'm going to die.

2234
01:51:40,480 --> 01:51:42,480
You're like, well, you... I'm not going to be able to go on my trip.

2235
01:51:42,480 --> 01:51:47,800
I'm going to get my $1,000 scholarship, I'm going to be stupid!

2236
01:51:47,800 --> 01:51:48,800
I don't give a fuck.

2237
01:51:48,800 --> 01:51:52,840
You're an idiot already if you think that you're going to get a $1,000 scholarship from

2238
01:51:52,840 --> 01:51:57,160
the SACB for walking door-to-door to sell their fucking subscription.

2239
01:51:57,160 --> 01:51:58,600
You're an idiot.

2240
01:51:58,600 --> 01:52:03,120
Maybe you should have been smarter in the first place, and you wouldn't have to walk

2241
01:52:03,120 --> 01:52:09,320
door-to-door selling subscriptions to newspapers and said you'd be earning a scholarship from,

2242
01:52:09,320 --> 01:52:14,200
I don't know, someone that celebrates academic excellence.

2243
01:52:14,200 --> 01:52:15,200
You're an idiot.

2244
01:52:15,200 --> 01:52:18,000
And I don't want your fucking SACB subscriptions.

2245
01:52:18,000 --> 01:52:19,520
I don't care how you give them to me.

2246
01:52:19,520 --> 01:52:21,520
Get the fuck out!

2247
01:52:21,520 --> 01:52:27,400
Uh, I'm, I'm, I'm in a pretty good mood today, so I don't really have a lot of FUs.

2248
01:52:27,400 --> 01:52:29,360
I guess FU to traffic.

2249
01:52:29,360 --> 01:52:33,280
Like people driving to San Francisco don't know what they're doing and need to stop.

2250
01:52:33,280 --> 01:52:34,280
Get off my bridge.

2251
01:52:34,280 --> 01:52:37,840
FU, FU to the S-curve on the bridge, too, for slowing everything down.

2252
01:52:37,840 --> 01:52:41,080
Well, you know, a lot of people, a lot of trucks have been running off of it.

2253
01:52:41,080 --> 01:52:42,080
Did you hear about that?

2254
01:52:42,080 --> 01:52:43,080
Yeah, I've heard about that.

2255
01:52:43,080 --> 01:52:48,280
Then drive carefully, but don't, you know, it's just, it's not that that slows things

2256
01:52:48,280 --> 01:52:49,280
down.

2257
01:52:49,280 --> 01:52:50,760
It's people cutting in and out of lanes.

2258
01:52:50,760 --> 01:52:51,760
That's what slows things down.

2259
01:52:51,760 --> 01:52:52,760
I agree.

2260
01:52:52,760 --> 01:52:54,920
That shit needs to be illegal at a certain point.

2261
01:52:54,920 --> 01:52:57,960
And like they need to do the thing where they put the bumps in the road that are so high,

2262
01:52:57,960 --> 01:53:00,160
you can't cross them.

2263
01:53:00,160 --> 01:53:04,600
And Kate, unless it's like a real emergency or something, you know, it's just ridiculous.

2264
01:53:04,600 --> 01:53:09,040
And they should have a way that if you do happen to be stupid enough to drive off the

2265
01:53:09,040 --> 01:53:11,560
edge that you die.

2266
01:53:11,560 --> 01:53:15,400
There should be grinders and explosions at the bottom of the hill.

2267
01:53:15,400 --> 01:53:19,920
And most importantly, human-eating cats living in the bay.

2268
01:53:19,920 --> 01:53:22,320
That's what they did at Alcatraz, actually.

2269
01:53:22,320 --> 01:53:23,820
That's how people didn't escape Alcatraz.

2270
01:53:23,820 --> 01:53:25,360
They had human-eating cats in the water.

2271
01:53:25,360 --> 01:53:26,360
Cat sharks.

2272
01:53:26,360 --> 01:53:27,360
That's right.

2273
01:53:27,360 --> 01:53:28,360
Cat sharks.

2274
01:53:28,360 --> 01:53:29,360
True story.

2275
01:53:29,360 --> 01:53:30,360
Look it up.

2276
01:53:30,360 --> 01:53:31,360
That's right.

2277
01:53:31,360 --> 01:53:32,360
It's on Wikipedia.

2278
01:53:32,360 --> 01:53:33,360
Quick, put it on Wikipedia.

2279
01:53:33,360 --> 01:53:35,360
We've got some good stories for you guys and then we're going to get to your stories on

2280
01:53:35,360 --> 01:53:37,800
our Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR.

2281
01:53:37,800 --> 01:53:39,440
But first, some Skype stories.

2282
01:53:39,440 --> 01:53:41,080
Some Skype stories?

2283
01:53:41,080 --> 01:53:42,080
What the hell?

2284
01:53:42,080 --> 01:53:45,160
The Skype line, then some last stories before we get to the Skype line.

2285
01:53:45,160 --> 01:53:46,160
Say what?

2286
01:53:46,160 --> 01:53:47,160
I'm dyslexic today.

2287
01:53:47,160 --> 01:53:48,160
It's crazy.

2288
01:53:48,160 --> 01:53:53,460
I'm putting up the last of the Amano pictures right now.

2289
01:53:53,460 --> 01:53:54,460
So they should be up.

2290
01:53:54,460 --> 01:53:55,460
Run.

2291
01:53:55,460 --> 01:53:56,460
Go look.

2292
01:53:56,460 --> 01:53:57,460
Quick.

2293
01:53:57,460 --> 01:54:02,960
Well, if you're in Japan, there's definitely your share of adult games available out there.

2294
01:54:02,960 --> 01:54:12,160
And yes, one of these adult games, which features women with extremely large breasts, very unnaturally

2295
01:54:12,160 --> 01:54:19,000
large breasts, but more power to them for that, and comes from Willowsoft.

2296
01:54:19,000 --> 01:54:26,600
Well, this game you can also get with a collector's edition that's bundled with a special manga,

2297
01:54:26,600 --> 01:54:29,720
an audio CD, and a personal assistant.

2298
01:54:29,720 --> 01:54:34,840
No, that's not a person that takes down notation for you and brings you coffee.

2299
01:54:34,840 --> 01:54:37,480
It is a pocket pussy.

2300
01:54:37,480 --> 01:54:39,840
It is a rubber thing that you put your penis in.

2301
01:54:39,840 --> 01:54:42,360
A fleshlight, basically?

2302
01:54:42,360 --> 01:54:43,360
Without the fleshlight.

2303
01:54:43,360 --> 01:54:44,360
No, no.

2304
01:54:44,360 --> 01:54:45,360
They're called ona cups.

2305
01:54:45,360 --> 01:54:47,360
As in woman cup.

2306
01:54:47,360 --> 01:54:48,360
Wow.

2307
01:54:48,360 --> 01:54:50,960
Just go to Jlist and look at all this stuff.

2308
01:54:50,960 --> 01:54:51,960
I seriously sell all this stuff.

2309
01:54:51,960 --> 01:54:52,960
I really don't need to.

2310
01:54:52,960 --> 01:54:53,960
I just don't.

2311
01:54:53,960 --> 01:54:54,960
They have commercials for them.

2312
01:54:54,960 --> 01:54:55,960
It's hilarious.

2313
01:54:55,960 --> 01:54:57,440
My life will be fine without it, actually.

2314
01:54:57,440 --> 01:54:59,260
I think it's funny looking at the commercials.

2315
01:54:59,260 --> 01:55:03,800
And it will be released during Christmas on the 25th.

2316
01:55:03,800 --> 01:55:05,480
Just in time for the holidays.

2317
01:55:05,480 --> 01:55:06,480
Just what I always wanted.

2318
01:55:06,480 --> 01:55:08,920
A pocket pussy to take with me.

2319
01:55:08,920 --> 01:55:12,920
I did love, though, you gotta share the artwork for the game with our chatters, because I

2320
01:55:12,920 --> 01:55:17,640
love the unnaturally large breasts that the women had.

2321
01:55:17,640 --> 01:55:22,800
They were larger than Springer Large, like Jerry Springer's show, when he has the women

2322
01:55:22,800 --> 01:55:24,460
with the unnaturally large titties.

2323
01:55:24,460 --> 01:55:25,520
That's gonna cause some back pain.

2324
01:55:25,520 --> 01:55:26,720
That's a Z cup.

2325
01:55:26,720 --> 01:55:27,720
That's some back pain.

2326
01:55:27,720 --> 01:55:30,120
I can't believe she doesn't walk over with a hunch.

2327
01:55:30,120 --> 01:55:35,240
I mean, that is just amazing.

2328
01:55:35,240 --> 01:55:41,200
That is some serious, seriously large boobies there.

2329
01:55:41,200 --> 01:55:46,560
Hey, and you know, and I kinda laugh at some of the stuff that I've seen, you know, like

2330
01:55:46,560 --> 01:55:55,840
they've got the booby pillows or the booby mouse pads and stuff like that, but that's

2331
01:55:55,840 --> 01:55:59,520
just a little much, I mean.

2332
01:55:59,520 --> 01:56:01,280
Sorry I'm laughing at a comment in chat.

2333
01:56:01,280 --> 01:56:06,480
Salacious Pop comments, I'd carry a pocket pussy with me, but only to give friends sudden

2334
01:56:06,480 --> 01:56:09,400
nose kisses.

2335
01:56:09,400 --> 01:56:13,660
Oh my god, if someone did that to me, I think I'd slap them.

2336
01:56:13,660 --> 01:56:15,880
Although the mental image is really funny.

2337
01:56:15,880 --> 01:56:19,160
Can you imagine walking up to someone, I kiss you!

2338
01:56:19,160 --> 01:56:21,920
Wow, their website is sure detailed.

2339
01:56:21,920 --> 01:56:22,920
What?

2340
01:56:22,920 --> 01:56:27,480
Oh, and I guess they have different ones depending on which woman that you want to, you know.

2341
01:56:27,480 --> 01:56:30,080
Oh well, whoopee!

2342
01:56:30,080 --> 01:56:32,200
Like different depths and widths and everything?

2343
01:56:32,200 --> 01:56:33,200
No, differently.

2344
01:56:33,200 --> 01:56:34,200
Are they all loose?

2345
01:56:34,200 --> 01:56:35,200
They're all different.

2346
01:56:35,200 --> 01:56:36,200
The women in this game, clearly.

2347
01:56:36,200 --> 01:56:40,120
They've got different patterns in there, see, you know, you've got the one chick there,

2348
01:56:40,120 --> 01:56:44,600
the blue, and it's got like, looks like nubs and ribs and then something else.

2349
01:56:44,600 --> 01:56:48,720
That looks like, okay, that looks like a diagram that you see in a geology book about what

2350
01:56:48,720 --> 01:56:51,480
it would look like if you drilled to the center of the earth.

2351
01:56:51,480 --> 01:56:53,240
That's what that looks like to me.

2352
01:56:53,240 --> 01:56:56,040
Oh, well you're drilling to the center of the earth, alright.

2353
01:56:56,040 --> 01:56:58,040
Shut up, you ass.

2354
01:56:58,040 --> 01:57:01,480
And then that one right there looks like a spine and a screw at the top there.

2355
01:57:01,480 --> 01:57:03,120
It does, it looks like an MRI picture.

2356
01:57:03,120 --> 01:57:09,720
And that one's got kind of like, you know, some sort of DNA helix thing going on there.

2357
01:57:09,720 --> 01:57:12,320
Wait a minute, is this radio really happening right now?

2358
01:57:12,320 --> 01:57:14,400
We're describing pocket pussies on our radio program?

2359
01:57:14,400 --> 01:57:17,240
You're right, that's not going to help our chat room, I gotta link this into the chat

2360
01:57:17,240 --> 01:57:18,240
room.

2361
01:57:18,240 --> 01:57:19,240
Yes you do.

2362
01:57:19,240 --> 01:57:21,240
The commercials, the commercials are hilarious.

2363
01:57:21,240 --> 01:57:23,240
No, thank you.

2364
01:57:23,240 --> 01:57:27,520
Well, you know, Rob, they do make vibrators.

2365
01:57:27,520 --> 01:57:35,080
Oh, it was funny, the other day we were watching and I, you know, this is the perfect use of

2366
01:57:35,080 --> 01:57:36,080
our PS3.

2367
01:57:36,080 --> 01:57:42,320
Oh, and then of course in the one that looks like they're underage of course is in there.

2368
01:57:42,320 --> 01:57:43,320
You gotta love that.

2369
01:57:43,320 --> 01:57:44,320
Yay.

2370
01:57:44,320 --> 01:57:50,600
No, there is like, they had like an interactive device or whatever that you would buy for

2371
01:57:50,600 --> 01:57:55,760
your PC that's 4.0 use or whatever, but it's interactive, you see, because it's synced

2372
01:57:55,760 --> 01:57:58,760
up with whatever's on the computer.

2373
01:57:58,760 --> 01:58:02,480
Technology, gotta love it.

2374
01:58:02,480 --> 01:58:04,480
Holy moly.

2375
01:58:04,480 --> 01:58:09,680
I just got a picture of Marissa and she said, were the boobies bigger than mine?

2376
01:58:09,680 --> 01:58:11,740
Not by much.

2377
01:58:11,740 --> 01:58:12,740
Not by much.

2378
01:58:12,740 --> 01:58:13,740
That's an impressive picture.

2379
01:58:13,740 --> 01:58:15,040
Marissa has the best rack ever.

2380
01:58:15,040 --> 01:58:18,220
That is an impressive picture.

2381
01:58:18,220 --> 01:58:22,960
I just want to, like, I am, I am completely secure in my homosexuality, okay?

2382
01:58:22,960 --> 01:58:29,400
I am 100% secure in my, my fagness, but I want to like bury my face in that.

2383
01:58:29,400 --> 01:58:30,880
Like, I can't explain it.

2384
01:58:30,880 --> 01:58:36,840
That's because you have something that's built into male DNA, whether you're gay or not,

2385
01:58:36,840 --> 01:58:39,000
that boobies are important.

2386
01:58:39,000 --> 01:58:40,560
Were you breastfed, Rob?

2387
01:58:40,560 --> 01:58:41,800
I know.

2388
01:58:41,800 --> 01:58:42,800
That could be part of it.

2389
01:58:42,800 --> 01:58:43,800
I don't know.

2390
01:58:43,800 --> 01:58:44,800
I do.

2391
01:58:44,800 --> 01:58:46,400
Quit trying to make it sound like it's like a psychological thing.

2392
01:58:46,400 --> 01:58:48,480
It's much more basic than that.

2393
01:58:48,480 --> 01:58:50,680
Yeah, it looks like they do have multiple box sets.

2394
01:58:50,680 --> 01:58:52,720
Rob, Rob, it's because boobies are fun.

2395
01:58:52,720 --> 01:58:53,720
The boobies are fun.

2396
01:58:53,720 --> 01:58:56,240
That's what it boils down to.

2397
01:58:56,240 --> 01:58:58,920
You guys are going to have to get her to post the link if you want to see it, because now

2398
01:58:58,920 --> 01:59:06,440
all the chat is like, link, link, link, link, please, please link, link, please.

2399
01:59:06,440 --> 01:59:08,640
And Marissa says gay man motorboat me all the time.

2400
01:59:08,640 --> 01:59:13,320
I tell you, if you post that link in chat, it's going to get really quiet and chat for

2401
01:59:13,320 --> 01:59:16,720
about the next five minutes.

2402
01:59:16,720 --> 01:59:20,440
Anyhow, one more story for you guys.

2403
01:59:20,440 --> 01:59:25,120
And then we're going to get to the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR, and we're going to travel

2404
01:59:25,120 --> 01:59:27,880
the world here a little bit and go to Brazil.

2405
01:59:27,880 --> 01:59:31,200
And it sounds like Brazil is following in the footsteps of some other places around

2406
01:59:31,200 --> 01:59:33,400
the world.

2407
01:59:33,400 --> 01:59:40,000
It's the home of a recently proposed bill coming from Senator Vladir Raup, and this

2408
01:59:40,000 --> 01:59:44,240
bill was recently passed by the Education Commission of the Brazilian Senate and is

2409
01:59:44,240 --> 01:59:48,080
now about to be voted on by the Committee of Constitution and Justice.

2410
01:59:48,080 --> 01:59:52,720
And what they're trying to do, they're trying to, quote, curb the manufacture, distribution,

2411
01:59:52,720 --> 01:59:57,840
importation, distribution, yes, it's in there twice, trading in custody, storage of the

2412
01:59:57,840 --> 02:00:02,620
video games that affect the customs and traditions of the people, their worship, creeds, religions

2413
02:00:02,620 --> 02:00:03,620
and symbols.

2414
02:00:03,620 --> 02:00:08,120
In other words, they're basically trying to eliminate video games in bad taste, which

2415
02:00:08,120 --> 02:00:13,960
could be violent video games and, you know, lots of things among that route.

2416
02:00:13,960 --> 02:00:14,960
You know what?

2417
02:00:14,960 --> 02:00:17,600
They've tried to do that many places and it never works.

2418
02:00:17,600 --> 02:00:22,620
Of course, Brazil isn't this country, but, you know, I just, it would be sad to hear

2419
02:00:22,620 --> 02:00:27,480
about that, so.

2420
02:00:27,480 --> 02:00:32,640
Just learn from, you can't stop freedom of expression.

2421
02:00:32,640 --> 02:00:38,360
I mean, as much as this, like, fleshlight pocket pussy thing is ridiculous, I love the

2422
02:00:38,360 --> 02:00:40,360
fact that it can be made.

2423
02:00:40,360 --> 02:00:41,500
You know what I mean?

2424
02:00:41,500 --> 02:00:44,560
The fact that it exists brings me lols.

2425
02:00:44,560 --> 02:00:47,080
So, all right.

2426
02:00:47,080 --> 02:00:53,960
Anyhow, we're going to go to the Skype line now, 1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype

2427
02:00:53,960 --> 02:00:54,960
is OrangeLoungeRadio.

2428
02:00:54,960 --> 02:00:58,920
If you want to give us a call, we're going to take some calls right now.

2429
02:00:58,920 --> 02:01:02,280
The Skype line is open for business, taking your calls.

2430
02:01:02,280 --> 02:01:05,920
In the meantime, some last-minute stories while we wait for the little delay there.

2431
02:01:05,920 --> 02:01:06,920
Loki, I don't know if you have anything to say.

2432
02:01:06,920 --> 02:01:07,920
I have one.

2433
02:01:07,920 --> 02:01:08,920
Oh, yes.

2434
02:01:08,920 --> 02:01:09,920
Dark Sakura.

2435
02:01:09,920 --> 02:01:10,920
Boobs are great.

2436
02:01:10,920 --> 02:01:11,920
The end.

2437
02:01:11,920 --> 02:01:12,920
And we're getting a call, so let's take the phone.

2438
02:01:12,920 --> 02:01:13,920
Hello.

2439
02:01:13,920 --> 02:01:14,920
You're on OrangeLoungeRadio.

2440
02:01:14,920 --> 02:01:15,920
Who's this?

2441
02:01:15,920 --> 02:01:16,920
Hi.

2442
02:01:16,920 --> 02:01:17,920
This is Spazinator.

2443
02:01:17,920 --> 02:01:18,920
Hi, Spazinator.

2444
02:01:18,920 --> 02:01:19,920
What's on your mind tonight?

2445
02:01:19,920 --> 02:01:20,920
Two things.

2446
02:01:20,920 --> 02:01:30,840
You know, first, so far, this episode has kind of been the best episode of OLR so far.

2447
02:01:30,840 --> 02:01:32,680
Well, thank you very much.

2448
02:01:32,680 --> 02:01:34,920
Is it because it's very porn-tastic tonight?

2449
02:01:34,920 --> 02:01:35,920
I'm sorry.

2450
02:01:35,920 --> 02:01:41,000
You know, with my ear infection, it's kind of hard to hear you.

2451
02:01:41,000 --> 02:01:42,240
Could you repeat that for me?

2452
02:01:42,240 --> 02:01:43,240
That's all right.

2453
02:01:43,240 --> 02:01:44,560
Is it because we're porn-tastic tonight?

2454
02:01:44,560 --> 02:01:45,560
Oh, yeah.

2455
02:01:45,560 --> 02:01:48,300
I mean, you know, not too sad.

2456
02:01:48,300 --> 02:01:49,800
You cover your what?

2457
02:01:49,800 --> 02:01:53,120
Boobs, vaginas, and bodily functions.

2458
02:01:53,120 --> 02:01:57,440
I mean, yeah, there's probably stuff for you.

2459
02:01:57,440 --> 02:02:01,200
Nothing, but you can't think of it off the top of my head.

2460
02:02:01,200 --> 02:02:02,640
The gay man in me is ashamed tonight.

2461
02:02:02,640 --> 02:02:05,880
I feel like I need to go blow someone after the show, but anyhow.

2462
02:02:05,880 --> 02:02:15,640
Well, yeah, to get to the main point of my call, yeah, I kind of wanted to touch on something

2463
02:02:15,640 --> 02:02:19,360
that you were mentioning towards the beginning of the show.

2464
02:02:19,360 --> 02:02:20,360
Yeah.

2465
02:02:20,360 --> 02:02:28,360
Well, you know, I mean, with the whole rumor of the PSP Go add-on, and it can relate to

2466
02:02:28,360 --> 02:02:35,280
the whole, you know, I don't know what you want to call it, flunkers in town, and the

2467
02:02:35,280 --> 02:02:41,520
motion controller for the PSP, you know, PS3 as well in the sense, it's probably a good

2468
02:02:41,520 --> 02:02:49,640
idea that the PSP add-on doesn't come out, simply because of one simple reason.

2469
02:02:49,640 --> 02:02:58,120
Traditionally speaking, add-ons, for instance, do really, really horrible in terms of sales

2470
02:02:58,120 --> 02:02:59,120
and whatnot.

2471
02:02:59,120 --> 02:03:13,320
Classic examples are the Sega CD, the 32X, and more recently, the 360 HD DVD add-on,

2472
02:03:13,320 --> 02:03:16,640
and the PlayStation 2's hard drive.

2473
02:03:16,640 --> 02:03:19,840
You know, that did loudly.

2474
02:03:19,840 --> 02:03:27,840
The simple reason for that is that, you know, add-ons, you know, kind of like, flunk through

2475
02:03:27,840 --> 02:03:40,440
the market a little bit, and game manufacturers can't rely on people buying these add-ons,

2476
02:03:40,440 --> 02:03:47,720
and therefore, you know, they tend to shy away from catering to these add-ons.

2477
02:03:47,720 --> 02:03:51,620
There's a lot of add-ons that don't do very well, because they're not very well supported.

2478
02:03:51,620 --> 02:03:53,920
They're made for, like, one game, and then that's it.

2479
02:03:53,920 --> 02:03:56,600
You know, you can go back through gaming's history, and there's just tons of stuff that

2480
02:03:56,600 --> 02:03:59,120
just wasn't very well supported.

2481
02:03:59,120 --> 02:04:05,280
The Super Scope 6, but some were also very good on the other side, because they got a

2482
02:04:05,280 --> 02:04:09,800
lot of support for them, like DDR mats did very well, because the games that, you know,

2483
02:04:09,800 --> 02:04:10,800
came out with them.

2484
02:04:10,800 --> 02:04:14,320
There was a ton of them, and, you know, folks got use out of them, and the guitar peripherals

2485
02:04:14,320 --> 02:04:15,320
do very well, too.

2486
02:04:15,320 --> 02:04:19,480
But don't forget, too, the biggest difference here, when you're talking about the PSP, and

2487
02:04:19,480 --> 02:04:22,160
what we're talking about at the beginning of the show, is that you're having an add-on

2488
02:04:22,160 --> 02:04:23,880
for something that should have been there in the first place.

2489
02:04:23,880 --> 02:04:28,240
It's ridiculous that, you know, you would get this add-on if you, what, just go buy

2490
02:04:28,240 --> 02:04:30,520
the PSP 3000 if you want a UMD.

2491
02:04:30,520 --> 02:04:32,520
It makes no sense at all.

2492
02:04:32,520 --> 02:04:33,520
Yeah.

2493
02:04:33,520 --> 02:04:45,560
Yeah, you definitely got a point there, in both cases, and also, you know, like you mentioned,

2494
02:04:45,560 --> 02:04:54,840
the DDR mats and Rock Band, Guitar Hero stuff, you know, does so well, but you gotta be reminded

2495
02:04:54,840 --> 02:05:01,520
that that kind of stuff is kind of being a minority, in a sense, and the companies that

2496
02:05:01,520 --> 02:05:07,720
put those stuff out are taking, like, a really, really major risk with that stuff.

2497
02:05:07,720 --> 02:05:16,360
And in terms of, like, Project Metal and Sony's motion controller, sure, I'm willing to bet

2498
02:05:16,360 --> 02:05:22,320
that there will be some early adopters that will probably get it for the novelty of it,

2499
02:05:22,320 --> 02:05:28,720
and probably wouldn't use that stuff for a while, up until the novelty wears off.

2500
02:05:28,720 --> 02:05:29,720
Well, you know what?

2501
02:05:29,720 --> 02:05:30,720
Peripherals?

2502
02:05:30,720 --> 02:05:34,960
I understand peripherals give sometimes developers, I think right now, a false sense of security

2503
02:05:34,960 --> 02:05:40,200
because DDR's done so well, because Guitar Hero's done so well, but I think Tony Hawk

2504
02:05:40,200 --> 02:05:43,920
at the right is gonna bring him right back to reminding folks that peripherals don't

2505
02:05:43,920 --> 02:05:47,840
always make the game, that's for sure, and especially the amount that folks spend on

2506
02:05:47,840 --> 02:05:48,840
it.

2507
02:05:48,840 --> 02:05:49,840
Yeah, true.

2508
02:05:49,840 --> 02:06:02,040
Yeah, the only reason the Wii remote did well is because, in a sense, Nintendo got it right

2509
02:06:02,040 --> 02:06:04,520
where they packed the stuff in.

2510
02:06:04,520 --> 02:06:06,520
Right, and that was the system.

2511
02:06:06,520 --> 02:06:10,120
Every single game has to support it, therefore there's plenty of games out there that support

2512
02:06:10,120 --> 02:06:11,120
it.

2513
02:06:11,120 --> 02:06:14,240
But it's very interesting, isn't it, that sometimes folks' complaints about the Wii

2514
02:06:14,240 --> 02:06:18,240
is that they should make some games that don't support it, you know, that don't overdo it

2515
02:06:18,240 --> 02:06:19,880
with the motion controls.

2516
02:06:19,880 --> 02:06:21,600
The Wii's been very interesting.

2517
02:06:21,600 --> 02:06:22,600
Very interesting.

2518
02:06:22,600 --> 02:06:27,080
Spaznator, I gotta wrap up and let you go here so we can get some more calls.

2519
02:06:27,080 --> 02:06:29,360
Do you have any other final thoughts for our listeners?

2520
02:06:29,360 --> 02:06:32,160
Uh, no, not that I can go.

2521
02:06:32,160 --> 02:06:33,440
Alright, well thank you.

2522
02:06:33,440 --> 02:06:34,440
Have a good one.

2523
02:06:34,440 --> 02:06:38,000
Yeah, thanks as always for the call, Spaznator, and I hope you were able to dig yourself out

2524
02:06:38,000 --> 02:06:41,760
of the snow that you get there, just like we'll have to dig ourselves out tomorrow morning.

2525
02:06:41,760 --> 02:06:42,760
Alright.

2526
02:06:42,760 --> 02:06:43,760
Alright.

2527
02:06:43,760 --> 02:06:44,760
Take care.

2528
02:06:44,760 --> 02:06:50,920
Um, we're gonna get some more calls, 1-877-GAME-OLR, our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio,

2529
02:06:50,920 --> 02:06:52,680
and we'll get to calls in just a moment.

2530
02:06:52,680 --> 02:06:56,120
I don't know if, uh, Loki had any last minute stories you wanted to do real quick?

2531
02:06:56,120 --> 02:06:57,120
Yeah, sure.

2532
02:06:57,120 --> 02:07:00,200
Um, Mirror's Edge is gonna be coming to the iPhone soon.

2533
02:07:00,200 --> 02:07:02,360
It's a little bit different than normal Mirror's Edge.

2534
02:07:02,360 --> 02:07:07,440
It's actually kind of more of a side-scroll game, but it's, uh, still 3D, and it looks

2535
02:07:07,440 --> 02:07:08,440
neat.

2536
02:07:08,440 --> 02:07:11,080
Uh, hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio, who's this?

2537
02:07:11,080 --> 02:07:12,320
It's Ranma one more time.

2538
02:07:12,320 --> 02:07:13,320
Hi, Ranma, what's on your mind?

2539
02:07:13,320 --> 02:07:15,320
Lucky you, getting through two weeks in a row.

2540
02:07:15,320 --> 02:07:16,320
Not too much.

2541
02:07:16,320 --> 02:07:21,240
Um, couple of quick things, I'll be on my merry little way, um, first thing is, I don't

2542
02:07:21,240 --> 02:07:26,760
know if you saw, but I had made a retweet about President Katz coming to the US.

2543
02:07:26,760 --> 02:07:27,760
Uh huh.

2544
02:07:27,760 --> 02:07:28,760
Did you see that?

2545
02:07:28,760 --> 02:07:30,760
No, wait, like, for real?

2546
02:07:30,760 --> 02:07:36,800
Well, someone on Twitter goes, going by the name of smap454, his name is Matt Cox, made

2547
02:07:36,800 --> 02:07:40,520
a tweet to Ranma Wee saying that President Katz coming to the US.

2548
02:07:40,520 --> 02:07:41,520
Uh huh.

2549
02:07:41,520 --> 02:07:46,360
And I retweeted it, but it just kind of fell right in the water, so I don't know if you

2550
02:07:46,360 --> 02:07:47,360
guys had heard about it.

2551
02:07:47,360 --> 02:07:48,360
When was it?

2552
02:07:48,360 --> 02:07:49,360
Was it today?

2553
02:07:49,360 --> 02:07:51,760
No, actually, this was about three days ago.

2554
02:07:51,760 --> 02:07:55,360
No, I didn't see it, I've been bad on keeping current on Twitter.

2555
02:07:55,360 --> 02:07:57,040
Would I see it on Ranma Wee's Twitter?

2556
02:07:57,040 --> 02:08:01,480
Yes, and I actually have, I actually have the Twitter, um, page up, I can put it in

2557
02:08:01,480 --> 02:08:07,360
the chat room, and even though it makes for great radio, it's Twitter.com slash smat454.

2558
02:08:07,360 --> 02:08:11,960
Well, wait, now they're saying President Katz, the revolution is coming to the US, that's

2559
02:08:11,960 --> 02:08:16,200
just, they're just talking about the, the, the fever, President Katz fever, I don't think

2560
02:08:16,200 --> 02:08:17,200
they mean a game.

2561
02:08:17,200 --> 02:08:20,960
Because, like, yeah, if you look at a couple tweets before that, they're saying President

2562
02:08:20,960 --> 02:08:24,880
Katz for the win, we need President Katz, I don't think they're talking about the actual

2563
02:08:24,880 --> 02:08:25,880
game.

2564
02:08:25,880 --> 02:08:26,880
I wish.

2565
02:08:26,880 --> 02:08:27,880
It's probably a listener to this program.

2566
02:08:27,880 --> 02:08:32,040
Probably so, but when it came across to my feed, I'm automatically, assuming, so I picked

2567
02:08:32,040 --> 02:08:36,000
up the rights to the game, it's coming over, you know?

2568
02:08:36,000 --> 02:08:37,000
I wish.

2569
02:08:37,000 --> 02:08:40,840
If these stories about the fact that it only sold 100 copies are true, maybe it won't happen,

2570
02:08:40,840 --> 02:08:44,600
but, you know, again, I gotta be careful, I don't want to make this the President Katz

2571
02:08:44,600 --> 02:08:48,680
show, but my point still stands, this game would sell if it came out here, and it will

2572
02:08:48,680 --> 02:08:50,920
sell much more than 100 copies.

2573
02:08:50,920 --> 02:08:53,400
I mean, hell, they made a sequel to We Cheer.

2574
02:08:53,400 --> 02:08:54,400
I know, right?

2575
02:08:54,400 --> 02:08:57,920
Like, get their, and muscle, hello, Muscle March.

2576
02:08:57,920 --> 02:08:58,920
End of argument.

2577
02:08:58,920 --> 02:09:03,120
Yeah, yeah, you, yeah, you got a valid point on that one, yeah.

2578
02:09:03,120 --> 02:09:04,120
Exactly.

2579
02:09:04,120 --> 02:09:07,600
Well, anything else on your mind tonight, DJ Rama?

2580
02:09:07,600 --> 02:09:08,600
Something interesting.

2581
02:09:08,600 --> 02:09:14,560
Saturday, I called Best Buy, I had an issue about my TV set, but at the same time, my

2582
02:09:14,560 --> 02:09:19,280
360s acted kind of odd, so then I called them to see if I could get it replaced, which is

2583
02:09:19,280 --> 02:09:20,280
not a problem.

2584
02:09:20,280 --> 02:09:24,360
So I asked them another question, because it seems that another one of my coworkers,

2585
02:09:24,360 --> 02:09:30,040
he has a 360 with a two-year coverage by Best Buy, and they're refusing to take his 360

2586
02:09:30,040 --> 02:09:33,300
because it's the Red Ring of Death, so I asked them about that.

2587
02:09:33,300 --> 02:09:38,520
It seems that now, when you buy your Xbox 360 from Best Buy, you know you get the two-year

2588
02:09:38,520 --> 02:09:39,880
black type protection?

2589
02:09:39,880 --> 02:09:41,640
It does not cover the Red Ring of Death.

2590
02:09:41,640 --> 02:09:46,040
Now, if you already have the coverage, you're good, provided that you bought your console

2591
02:09:46,040 --> 02:09:49,520
before, I believe, September of 2008.

2592
02:09:49,520 --> 02:09:53,460
I'd actually, I want to say I've heard of this before, and it's because the Red Rings

2593
02:09:53,460 --> 02:09:56,220
are covered under Microsoft's warranty, and Best Buy don't want to have anything to do

2594
02:09:56,220 --> 02:09:57,220
with it anymore.

2595
02:09:57,220 --> 02:10:00,120
Well, it looks like I got lucky with my Red Ring.

2596
02:10:00,120 --> 02:10:04,400
Well, the thing is also, I mean, if there are anything like what we have to deal with,

2597
02:10:04,400 --> 02:10:09,360
Microsoft is telling us to tell our customers that they need to go through Microsoft to

2598
02:10:09,360 --> 02:10:11,120
get that system fixed.

2599
02:10:11,120 --> 02:10:14,540
So there's no point in returning it back to the place you bought it.

2600
02:10:14,540 --> 02:10:18,400
You need to go send it to Microsoft, because all they're going to end up doing is having

2601
02:10:18,400 --> 02:10:25,840
to send it back to Microsoft anyways, and really, it's the way you need to do it anyways.

2602
02:10:25,840 --> 02:10:26,840
True.

2603
02:10:26,840 --> 02:10:31,360
So the funny thing is, I mean, I used to work for them, and under this coverage, if someone

2604
02:10:31,360 --> 02:10:35,320
brought the console back, whatever console it was, Best Buy would still get the full

2605
02:10:35,320 --> 02:10:38,120
credit on it anyway, back from the manufacturer.

2606
02:10:38,120 --> 02:10:41,080
So that's the part that kind of threw me off for a long time.

2607
02:10:41,080 --> 02:10:42,080
Maybe I'm not anymore, though.

2608
02:10:42,080 --> 02:10:43,080
I don't know.

2609
02:10:43,080 --> 02:10:44,080
I don't think.

2610
02:10:44,080 --> 02:10:45,080
Strange.

2611
02:10:45,080 --> 02:10:49,480
All right, well, Rama, thank you so much for the call, and thanks for the heads up on Best

2612
02:10:49,480 --> 02:10:50,880
Buy, if folks didn't already know.

2613
02:10:50,880 --> 02:10:53,680
It's something to think about, especially this holiday season, as you're buying people

2614
02:10:53,680 --> 02:10:54,680
Xboxes.

2615
02:10:54,680 --> 02:10:58,520
The thing to think of possibly as a reason why they wouldn't take it back, too, is they

2616
02:10:58,520 --> 02:11:03,320
could just say, oh yeah, Red Ringed, and in reality, their console got banned.

2617
02:11:03,320 --> 02:11:04,320
Don't.

2618
02:11:04,320 --> 02:11:08,320
Yeah, because the thing is, they're supposed to pop open the consoles and test it out and

2619
02:11:08,320 --> 02:11:12,520
make sure Red Ringed or whatever, because that's what I did when I worked at Geeksfella,

2620
02:11:12,520 --> 02:11:15,120
so I brought back defective PS2s and Xboxes.

2621
02:11:15,120 --> 02:11:19,680
When I showed my 360 in the box, they took it, grabbed me another one off the shelf,

2622
02:11:19,680 --> 02:11:22,240
and I'm like, here you go.

2623
02:11:22,240 --> 02:11:24,960
And it was a slow day, too.

2624
02:11:24,960 --> 02:11:25,960
Hmm.

2625
02:11:25,960 --> 02:11:26,960
All right.

2626
02:11:26,960 --> 02:11:30,040
Well, we're going to let you go, Rama, so we can get some more calls, but thank you

2627
02:11:30,040 --> 02:11:31,040
guys.

2628
02:11:31,040 --> 02:11:32,040
No problem.

2629
02:11:32,040 --> 02:11:33,520
Thank you so much, as always, for calling in, OK?

2630
02:11:33,520 --> 02:11:34,520
And upon you.

2631
02:11:34,520 --> 02:11:35,520
Have a good week.

2632
02:11:35,520 --> 02:11:36,520
Have a good week.

2633
02:11:36,520 --> 02:11:37,520
You too.

2634
02:11:37,520 --> 02:11:38,520
All right.

2635
02:11:38,520 --> 02:11:39,520
877-GAME-OLR.

2636
02:11:39,520 --> 02:11:42,840
Our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio, and that's the place to get in on the Skype

2637
02:11:42,840 --> 02:11:46,120
line if you have anything you want to talk about tonight on the program.

2638
02:11:46,120 --> 02:11:47,560
Other last minute stories we have, Logan?

2639
02:11:47,560 --> 02:11:48,560
Yeah, sure.

2640
02:11:48,560 --> 02:11:54,120
This is a PlayStation Network game that's going to be nearly 10 gigabytes in size, and

2641
02:11:54,120 --> 02:12:01,880
it's the PlayStation Network title Record of Argressed War, and apparently it's a strategy

2642
02:12:01,880 --> 02:12:09,120
RPG, and it's coming to North America by Axis Games localization.

2643
02:12:09,120 --> 02:12:13,600
One of the companies I said to send the President and Cat emails to, because they localize all

2644
02:12:13,600 --> 02:12:18,640
sorts of weird stuff, including this game that has apparently anime chicks seductively

2645
02:12:18,640 --> 02:12:20,320
eating sausages.

2646
02:12:20,320 --> 02:12:23,920
Oh, joy and rapture.

2647
02:12:23,920 --> 02:12:25,640
This picture here.

2648
02:12:25,640 --> 02:12:27,040
Too much porn tonight.

2649
02:12:27,040 --> 02:12:28,040
Yeah.

2650
02:12:28,040 --> 02:12:32,680
I mean, I know there's no such thing as too much porn, but tonight might be pushing the

2651
02:12:32,680 --> 02:12:33,680
limit.

2652
02:12:33,680 --> 02:12:34,680
I'm just saying.

2653
02:12:34,680 --> 02:12:37,440
I might have to put the explicit tag on tonight's show for once.

2654
02:12:37,440 --> 02:12:38,880
Anyhow, we got another call.

2655
02:12:38,880 --> 02:12:39,880
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio.

2656
02:12:39,880 --> 02:12:40,880
Who's this?

2657
02:12:40,880 --> 02:12:41,880
Hey, this is X-Link.

2658
02:12:41,880 --> 02:12:42,880
Hey, X-Link.

2659
02:12:42,880 --> 02:12:43,880
Hey, X-Link.

2660
02:12:43,880 --> 02:12:44,880
Hey, Lauren.

2661
02:12:44,880 --> 02:12:45,880
What are you talking about?

2662
02:12:45,880 --> 02:12:46,880
Clearly I'm smoking crack.

2663
02:12:46,880 --> 02:12:47,880
That means we're Orange Lounge Pornio.

2664
02:12:47,880 --> 02:12:50,920
X-Link, I'm sorry to make you wait there for a little bit, but what's in your mind?

2665
02:12:50,920 --> 02:12:51,920
Hey, no, no problem.

2666
02:12:51,920 --> 02:12:52,920
Not at all.

2667
02:12:52,920 --> 02:12:57,760
This has been a great show, everything from snow to boobs to flashlights.

2668
02:12:57,760 --> 02:12:58,760
To snowboob flashlights.

2669
02:12:58,760 --> 02:12:59,760
I know.

2670
02:12:59,760 --> 02:13:00,760
And food.

2671
02:13:00,760 --> 02:13:01,840
It's been an amazing night.

2672
02:13:01,840 --> 02:13:04,600
Well, I found a little bit of information, it was interesting.

2673
02:13:04,600 --> 02:13:07,360
I ran you about this before, and I told you to look this up.

2674
02:13:07,360 --> 02:13:10,420
I don't know if you did or not, but they were talking about Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep,

2675
02:13:10,420 --> 02:13:16,940
of course, is going to be hitting over in Japan on January 9th, but Jesse McCarthy on

2676
02:13:16,940 --> 02:13:22,860
his tweet back about November 30th put up a tweet and says, recording yet another Kingdom

2677
02:13:22,860 --> 02:13:27,140
Hearts game. All you gamers eat your heart out. Man, what a process, though. The first

2678
02:13:27,140 --> 02:13:32,260
recording was in 2005 for game one, which I think they said that actually the first

2679
02:13:32,260 --> 02:13:38,560
game came out in the U.S. in 2002, which then they said part two came out in 2005, but none

2680
02:13:38,560 --> 02:13:42,580
of the last, though, which they're talking about, hopefully that means that we will be

2681
02:13:42,580 --> 02:13:47,900
getting Birth by Sleep here come sometime maybe either middle of next year or possibly

2682
02:13:47,900 --> 02:13:50,780
the year after, so I'm definitely looking forward to that.

2683
02:13:50,780 --> 02:13:54,860
I'm kind of not surprised that, you know, it's making its way over here.

2684
02:13:54,860 --> 02:13:58,780
No, not at all, but I'm looking forward to it because it's going to add a lot of

2685
02:13:58,780 --> 02:14:02,740
information to the storyline, especially since it's supposed to be the prequel to what

2686
02:14:02,740 --> 02:14:07,540
all happened for the story, so. And it's supposedly rumors are claiming that it might

2687
02:14:07,540 --> 02:14:12,300
have, like, of course, all the games at the end have that little sneak peek of what's

2688
02:14:12,300 --> 02:14:16,180
going on. It supposedly could possibly have something for maybe, you know, part three.

2689
02:14:16,180 --> 02:14:17,180
So.

2690
02:14:17,180 --> 02:14:20,820
Let's hope. You know I'm all about the Kingdom Hearts part three, but it also makes

2691
02:14:20,820 --> 02:14:24,260
sense, you know, and I think this point got brought up a couple episodes ago is that that

2692
02:14:24,260 --> 02:14:28,820
team has been hard at work on Versus 13, which we've had very little information about,

2693
02:14:28,820 --> 02:14:33,060
so you know that that game is still heavy under development. I think once Versus 13

2694
02:14:33,060 --> 02:14:36,420
finally looks like it's nearing gold status and it's on its way out, which, honestly,

2695
02:14:36,420 --> 02:14:40,700
at this point, I don't think it's going to happen until 2011. I think we'll, I think

2696
02:14:40,700 --> 02:14:45,180
we'll have more. Because, you know, I think, here's my thought, actually, Versus 13, I

2697
02:14:45,180 --> 02:14:49,700
think is going to be a big thing at E3 2010 for Square. Because at that point, Final Fantasy

2698
02:14:49,700 --> 02:14:54,380
13, non-versus, the regular one, will be out. You know, now that we know the release date

2699
02:14:54,380 --> 02:14:59,200
for 13, it'll be out in Japan, it'll be out here in the U.S., that's done now. So,

2700
02:14:59,200 --> 02:15:03,760
I think Versus 13 will be big, and maybe they'll make a Kingdom Hearts announcement, but I

2701
02:15:03,760 --> 02:15:08,180
think that that's what's going to be their big thing at E3 this year, is finding more

2702
02:15:08,180 --> 02:15:09,180
on Versus.

2703
02:15:09,180 --> 02:15:13,180
I'm sorry, I don't mean to interrupt. I'm sorry. My prediction would be that the Kingdom

2704
02:15:13,180 --> 02:15:17,900
Hearts, and also there was, they've been showing teasers, especially over in Japan

2705
02:15:17,900 --> 02:15:25,060
for it, but the Parasite Eve, the third birthday, was also, been teased over in Japan, which,

2706
02:15:25,060 --> 02:15:29,500
of course, did very well. The first two did very well over here, I believe, in the U.S.

2707
02:15:29,500 --> 02:15:32,100
Yeah, surprising they never did a third one.

2708
02:15:32,100 --> 02:15:36,180
Well, they're supposed to, and it's supposed to be for PSP, and they already said that

2709
02:15:36,180 --> 02:15:40,060
it was going to come out, but there has been no release dates or anything of the, yeah,

2710
02:15:40,060 --> 02:15:43,980
they're just showing teasers, they had a little teaser, one or two teasers out for

2711
02:15:43,980 --> 02:15:44,980
that, but I'm hoping...

2712
02:15:44,980 --> 02:15:46,740
I still wish they'd translate the book.

2713
02:15:46,740 --> 02:15:51,100
I remember Parasite Eve, I remember a story that we covered on the show, like, it was

2714
02:15:51,100 --> 02:15:53,620
a while ago, probably about a year and a half ago, but I remember this has come up on the

2715
02:15:53,620 --> 02:15:58,100
show before. You know, it's, it's, it's being done, it's just, yeah, and I seem

2716
02:15:58,100 --> 02:16:02,620
to recall it was on the PSP, too, but it's a little weird that that's the direction

2717
02:16:02,620 --> 02:16:06,620
they're going with it, when they could do something, you know, epic on the PS3, but,

2718
02:16:06,620 --> 02:16:12,140
you know, whatever, or 360, whatever they want to do. I, I, I imagine that's something

2719
02:16:12,140 --> 02:16:15,260
they're going to pull out of their hat at E3. I'd be with you there.

2720
02:16:15,260 --> 02:16:18,180
I just, I'm just surprised to see what they will do. I mean, they're just going to try

2721
02:16:18,180 --> 02:16:22,780
to, you know, go for it, you know, so, if they do, that's great, if not, then...

2722
02:16:22,780 --> 02:16:26,900
So, alright, well, excellent, thank you so much for the call, and we're going to let

2723
02:16:26,900 --> 02:16:30,260
you go, so we can wrap up the show, but thank you so much, as always, and have a good night,

2724
02:16:30,260 --> 02:16:31,260
okay?

2725
02:16:31,260 --> 02:16:32,260
Of course, thanks.

2726
02:16:32,260 --> 02:16:33,260
Later.

2727
02:16:33,260 --> 02:16:34,260
See you.

2728
02:16:34,260 --> 02:16:36,020
That's going to do it for tonight's Skypline. Thank you so much to our callers tonight.

2729
02:16:36,020 --> 02:16:40,140
We really appreciate it. Sorry to those folks that didn't get through tonight, but it's

2730
02:16:40,140 --> 02:16:45,020
weird. Tonight's show's been moving very fast. We're actually probably going to end a little

2731
02:16:45,020 --> 02:16:48,080
bit earlier than usual, but you know what? It's also that time of year where the games

2732
02:16:48,080 --> 02:16:52,660
are out now, so there's not a whole lot of, you know, people are going to be sleeping

2733
02:16:52,660 --> 02:16:56,100
through December, and we'll get more game news come January, especially with all of

2734
02:16:56,100 --> 02:17:00,380
these postponements. I think first and second quarter 2010 are going to be very interesting.

2735
02:17:00,380 --> 02:17:02,020
First quarter is pretty interesting.

2736
02:17:02,020 --> 02:17:06,140
All these games that got delayed are finally going to come out. It's going to be very interesting.

2737
02:17:06,140 --> 02:17:09,020
But anyhow, we still have some last minute stories, right, Loki?

2738
02:17:09,020 --> 02:17:13,960
Yeah, and then, other than Mirror's Edge, there's also some other decent games coming

2739
02:17:13,960 --> 02:17:24,220
to the iPhone, including iPhone, the iPhone version of Ace Combat 11, or XI, I guess.

2740
02:17:24,220 --> 02:17:29,940
It's coming from Namco, of course. It looks pretty awesome. And they're also updating,

2741
02:17:29,940 --> 02:17:35,420
I guess, Guarders and Ghouls, no relation to Ghosts and Goblins.

2742
02:17:35,420 --> 02:17:38,540
I was going to say, that's what it sounds like. Is that like Ghosts and Goblins?

2743
02:17:38,540 --> 02:17:43,860
It's a zombie killing game, and it allows you, they're going to have GPS support now,

2744
02:17:43,860 --> 02:17:48,380
so you can move your iPhone around to turn your player in the game.

2745
02:17:48,380 --> 02:17:54,380
Deft wants to point out that's Ace Combat She, not XI, because Ace Combat 6 was the

2746
02:17:54,380 --> 02:17:56,060
last one, so they wouldn't jump right to XI.

2747
02:17:56,060 --> 02:18:01,780
Yeah, but you never. Okay, so She. And let's see, what else? So Serious Sam, the second

2748
02:18:01,780 --> 02:18:05,420
encounter, is also getting the HD treatment as well. And if I remember correctly, the

2749
02:18:05,420 --> 02:18:13,740
first one still hasn't come out yet, but still, that's kind of neat. So I'm assuming coming

2750
02:18:13,740 --> 02:18:21,340
to the same places as the first game, probably Steam, PlayStation Network, and Xbox Live

2751
02:18:21,340 --> 02:18:23,340
Arcade.

2752
02:18:23,340 --> 02:18:33,860
And then finally, Lips Party Classics will be coming out on the Xbox 360 in 2010, apparently

2753
02:18:33,860 --> 02:18:41,820
in the spring. It will feature 40 new tracks, including the Love Shack by the B-52s, Tub

2754
02:18:41,820 --> 02:18:47,820
Thumping by Chubba Wumba, I Will Survive by Gloria Gaynor, Rock and Roll All Night by

2755
02:18:47,820 --> 02:18:54,420
KISS, Wannabe by Spice Girls, I Think We're Alone Now by Tiffany, and YMCA by the Village

2756
02:18:54,420 --> 02:19:03,420
People. And of course, you know, your typical karaoke game.

2757
02:19:03,420 --> 02:19:10,600
And then finally, to kind of elaborate a little bit more on what the Record of Argos War was,

2758
02:19:10,600 --> 02:19:15,620
it's a game that had that soul breed function in there. Basically, you find these women

2759
02:19:15,620 --> 02:19:21,620
and you breed with them to create a new hero.

2760
02:19:21,620 --> 02:19:22,980
Okay.

2761
02:19:22,980 --> 02:19:23,980
I'm bringing it back around.

2762
02:19:23,980 --> 02:19:25,980
I see, yes.

2763
02:19:25,980 --> 02:19:26,980
I see.

2764
02:19:26,980 --> 02:19:27,980
Yeah.

2765
02:19:27,980 --> 02:19:28,980
Uh-huh.

2766
02:19:28,980 --> 02:19:33,980
That's why she was seductively eating the sausage. It all makes sense now.

2767
02:19:33,980 --> 02:19:39,140
Dot dot dot.

2768
02:19:39,140 --> 02:19:41,140
That's all I've got.

2769
02:19:41,140 --> 02:19:48,300
All right. Anyhow, we're going to wrap up here at Orange Lawns Radio and say goodnight

2770
02:19:48,300 --> 02:19:53,860
and all that fun stuff. DarkSakura, your final thought tonight?

2771
02:19:53,860 --> 02:19:54,860
My hands hurt.

2772
02:19:54,860 --> 02:19:55,860
Sorry to hear that.

2773
02:19:55,860 --> 02:19:57,500
Damn hat.

2774
02:19:57,500 --> 02:20:00,580
My hands don't hurt.

2775
02:20:00,580 --> 02:20:04,340
My final thought is, I want a taco. That's my final thought. I think that was my final

2776
02:20:04,340 --> 02:20:07,940
thought last week, but I again want a taco, just so you know. That's going to do it for

2777
02:20:07,940 --> 02:20:10,580
another episode of Orange Lawns Radio. Believe it or not, we're coming to a close. I know

2778
02:20:10,580 --> 02:20:13,740
it's a little early tonight, but like I said, it's a little bit of a slower news week. Not

2779
02:20:13,740 --> 02:20:17,200
as much to discuss as usual. Live listeners though, stay tuned because we have a little

2780
02:20:17,200 --> 02:20:20,380
extra something after the show as usual. For those of you guys listening on the podcast

2781
02:20:20,380 --> 02:20:23,500
though, that's going to do it. Thank you guys so much for downloading and supporting our

2782
02:20:23,500 --> 02:20:27,180
program. We really appreciate it. Again, all we ask, we do this stuff for free, so please

2783
02:20:27,180 --> 02:20:30,860
tell two people about the show. I know especially ever since the launch of the Facebook page,

2784
02:20:30,860 --> 02:20:34,460
a lot of you guys have really been selling the show to your friends. We really appreciate

2785
02:20:34,460 --> 02:20:39,220
that and the word of mouth goes a very long way. Just want to let you guys know it's really

2786
02:20:39,220 --> 02:20:43,460
appreciated because we don't really have advertising dollars. We don't have a big magazine supporting

2787
02:20:43,460 --> 02:20:48,740
us. We're not on TV or anything fancy like that. Word of mouth is all we got, so we really

2788
02:20:48,740 --> 02:20:53,660
appreciate it. If you didn't like our program, that's okay. We don't hate you that much,

2789
02:20:53,660 --> 02:20:56,760
but do check out some of the other programs on AllGames.com, some other great independent

2790
02:20:56,760 --> 02:21:00,640
podcasts that talk about other things. If you don't like us because we don't talk enough

2791
02:21:00,640 --> 02:21:04,420
modern warfare, there's a show on there that talks much more about first person shooters

2792
02:21:04,420 --> 02:21:09,900
or whatever might be up your alley. So thank you guys, of course, as always, and we'll

2793
02:21:09,900 --> 02:21:14,700
do it all again next week. Except remember guys, next week, sadly, not live, but it will

2794
02:21:14,700 --> 02:21:19,700
be pre-taped. If we can pre-tape it live, stay tuned to the Twitter and the Facebook

2795
02:21:19,700 --> 02:21:23,420
for all that information. Meanwhile, that's going to do it for another additional Orange

2796
02:21:23,420 --> 02:21:30,420
Lounge Radio. Till next week, I'm Rob Roberts, she's DarkSakura, he's Loki, and we're out!

2797
02:21:53,420 --> 02:22:00,420
See you next week!
