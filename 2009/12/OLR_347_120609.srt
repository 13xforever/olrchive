1
00:00:14,395 --> 00:00:15,796
[SPEAKER_04]: December 6, 2009.

2
00:00:16,536 --> 00:00:18,417
[SPEAKER_04]: Steam is about to get some more competition.

3
00:00:18,697 --> 00:00:21,198
[SPEAKER_04]: Could you soon play PSP Minis on your PS3?

4
00:00:21,538 --> 00:00:24,960
[SPEAKER_04]: And a long-lasting video game rumor is revealed to be true this week.

5
00:00:32,836 --> 00:00:37,203
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

6
00:00:37,223 --> 00:00:40,648
[SPEAKER_03]: We are that video game talk show dedicated to, of course, video games.

7
00:00:41,009 --> 00:00:44,034
[SPEAKER_03]: Video gaming, gaming culture, the gamer lifestyle, and food!

8
00:00:44,434 --> 00:00:45,656
[SPEAKER_03]: Lots and lots of food!

9
00:00:46,117 --> 00:00:46,778
[SPEAKER_03]: And crushing!

10
00:00:46,838 --> 00:00:47,579
[SPEAKER_03]: Nom nom nom.

11
00:00:48,220 --> 00:00:48,641
[SPEAKER_03]: and Yarn.

12
00:00:49,181 --> 00:00:52,324
[SPEAKER_03]: A third crocheting because I don't have the patience for that stuff.

13
00:00:52,364 --> 00:00:56,328
[SPEAKER_03]: And you've crocheted, by the way, of course, the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers and I'm Rob Roberts.

14
00:00:56,348 --> 00:00:56,848
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm making a hat.

15
00:00:57,049 --> 00:00:58,050
[SPEAKER_03]: And he's Techmaster Loki.

16
00:00:58,250 --> 00:00:59,351
[SPEAKER_03]: Why not just introduce him too?

17
00:00:59,811 --> 00:01:00,772
[SPEAKER_03]: How you doing, Techmaster Loki?

18
00:01:00,932 --> 00:01:01,433
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm doing fine.

19
00:01:01,573 --> 00:01:01,873
[SPEAKER_03]: Amazing.

20
00:01:02,114 --> 00:01:02,874
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so crocheting.

21
00:01:03,615 --> 00:01:04,636
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't have the patience for that.

22
00:01:05,357 --> 00:01:05,577
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

23
00:01:06,077 --> 00:01:06,498
[SPEAKER_03]: Just saying.

24
00:01:07,276 --> 00:01:09,738
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't think I did either, but it's actually fairly therapeutic.

25
00:01:09,918 --> 00:01:12,159
[SPEAKER_03]: I sit in front of my computer and chat with Becky or whoever else is on.

26
00:01:12,179 --> 00:01:13,780
[SPEAKER_03]: And watch random YouTubage?

27
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:25,840
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

28
00:01:26,441 --> 00:01:28,824
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, sometimes I'll watch other people crocheting while I crochet.

29
00:01:29,245 --> 00:01:34,011
[SPEAKER_07]: It's sort of like eating food while you're watching the Food Network or watching porn while you fuck.

30
00:01:35,473 --> 00:01:38,597
[SPEAKER_03]: Or in my case, watching The Biggest Loser while eating a giant pizza.

31
00:01:38,637 --> 00:01:39,738
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I like to do.

32
00:01:40,259 --> 00:01:41,320
[SPEAKER_03]: It makes me feel good about myself.

33
00:01:42,241 --> 00:01:43,343
[SPEAKER_03]: Techmaster Loki, how are you doing?

34
00:01:43,363 --> 00:01:43,964
[SPEAKER_03]: How's your week going?

35
00:01:45,086 --> 00:01:45,566
[SPEAKER_03]: It's okay.

36
00:02:13,522 --> 00:02:14,503
[SPEAKER_10]: Arcade Cabinet, I guess.

37
00:02:14,903 --> 00:02:15,183
[SPEAKER_10]: Sort of.

38
00:02:15,704 --> 00:02:16,484
[SPEAKER_10]: Bartop Cabinet.

39
00:02:16,584 --> 00:02:17,745
[SPEAKER_03]: That looks ghetto.

40
00:02:17,965 --> 00:02:19,406
[SPEAKER_03]: There's pictures of it at OrangeLawnRadio.com.

41
00:02:19,486 --> 00:02:20,267
[SPEAKER_03]: It's awesome, though.

42
00:02:20,507 --> 00:02:21,948
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it's ghetto awesome.

43
00:02:22,188 --> 00:02:23,329
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

44
00:02:23,569 --> 00:02:25,811
[SPEAKER_10]: So there's something... I don't know what happened with it.

45
00:02:25,971 --> 00:02:30,375
[SPEAKER_10]: It was something because I had wired up the analog stick to the directional...

46
00:02:31,335 --> 00:02:32,116
[SPEAKER_10]: Joystick that I had.

47
00:02:32,397 --> 00:02:33,478
[SPEAKER_10]: And there's a way you can do it.

48
00:02:33,518 --> 00:02:34,299
[SPEAKER_10]: It's pretty easy.

49
00:02:34,499 --> 00:02:44,390
[SPEAKER_10]: And the contact points are a lot bigger than trying to solder to the small, really tiny ribbon cable solder points that are for the actual digital directional pad.

50
00:02:45,752 --> 00:02:48,475
[SPEAKER_10]: So I figured, okay, I'll just solder to that.

51
00:02:48,655 --> 00:02:51,236
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, something happened, and I'm not sure what.

52
00:02:51,837 --> 00:02:54,818
[SPEAKER_10]: I thought I bridged something, but apparently that wasn't the case.

53
00:02:55,259 --> 00:03:00,522
[SPEAKER_10]: And for whatever reason, it just... The PSP seemed like it was only pressing down.

54
00:03:01,162 --> 00:03:04,464
[SPEAKER_10]: And it just consistently held down, down.

55
00:03:05,684 --> 00:03:11,328
[SPEAKER_10]: So that made it hard to kind of select games, play anything, because, you know, it'd be always pressing down.

56
00:03:12,388 --> 00:03:16,931
[SPEAKER_10]: So I figured, okay, I'm gonna look at and see what I did solder-wise, and I...

57
00:03:18,188 --> 00:03:18,829
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks for watching!

58
00:03:36,676 --> 00:03:41,497
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm just going to kind of take a break from it right now because there's not much I can really do with it.

59
00:03:41,517 --> 00:03:44,918
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it's got to be frustrating that you build this whole machine and then it just, oops.

60
00:03:44,938 --> 00:03:46,138
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, yeah, it was all ready to go.

61
00:03:46,158 --> 00:03:47,979
[SPEAKER_10]: I had some trouble like earlier in the week.

62
00:03:48,059 --> 00:03:59,982
[SPEAKER_10]: I couldn't get it to stay powered on and that I realized was a mistake because I had hooked up a push button backwards so it was hooked to the normally open instead of the normally closed.

63
00:04:00,742 --> 00:04:21,583
[SPEAKER_10]: and you know that causes it to basically when the button's not being pressed to be the button is pressed and then when you push the button the button isn't pressed so it's kind of backwards and once I fixed that it worked just fine powered up you know everything was hunky-dory and then you know I tested what buttons worked and what didn't and apparently my

64
00:04:22,523 --> 00:04:30,628
[SPEAKER_10]: R button didn't really work, which I'm guessing is because the solder point was super tiny, so I probably missed it when I was soldering.

65
00:04:31,349 --> 00:04:36,252
[SPEAKER_10]: And my triangle button wasn't working, which I didn't really even get to the point to fix that yet.

66
00:04:37,393 --> 00:04:42,516
[SPEAKER_10]: And then the constantly pressing down thing, which was kind of annoying.

67
00:04:44,890 --> 00:04:45,490
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks for watching!

68
00:04:54,929 --> 00:04:58,412
[SPEAKER_10]: Not quite everything yet, but there's a lot of it that's salvageable.

69
00:04:58,912 --> 00:05:02,855
[SPEAKER_10]: And honestly, if I want to try again, I mean, PSPs are dirt cheap.

70
00:05:02,915 --> 00:05:05,818
[SPEAKER_10]: If I look on Craigslist, I can get one sub 50 bucks.

71
00:05:06,078 --> 00:05:06,318
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.

72
00:05:06,338 --> 00:05:08,280
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, if I want to do that.

73
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:14,485
[SPEAKER_10]: And at the same time, I actually figured out a way requiring an extra device to be purchased.

74
00:05:14,565 --> 00:05:19,048
[SPEAKER_10]: But there is a way that's actually super easy to do that.

75
00:05:19,269 --> 00:05:23,532
[SPEAKER_10]: And not only will I be able to use the PSP in the arcade cabinet...

76
00:05:23,852 --> 00:05:23,912
[SPEAKER_10]: Wow.

77
00:05:39,112 --> 00:05:42,875
[SPEAKER_10]: It doesn't matter anyways, because I will have a working bar top cabinet.

78
00:05:42,895 --> 00:05:44,536
[SPEAKER_03]: I love that you just haven't totally given up.

79
00:05:45,296 --> 00:05:46,257
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll come back stronger.

80
00:05:46,417 --> 00:05:47,057
[SPEAKER_03]: PSP Cabinet 2.0.

81
00:05:48,338 --> 00:05:49,279
[SPEAKER_10]: Bigger and better.

82
00:05:49,499 --> 00:05:53,681
[SPEAKER_10]: At the same time, it was kind of a learning experience, because now I know how to solder slightly better.

83
00:05:54,062 --> 00:05:57,043
[SPEAKER_10]: Not enough to where I need to solder these...

84
00:05:58,544 --> 00:06:04,027
[SPEAKER_10]: Really small wires onto these contacts, and it was just, it was a mess.

85
00:06:04,107 --> 00:06:11,191
[SPEAKER_10]: It was super delicate, I mean, there was so much that could have gone wrong, and a lot of it did, and it was just, it wasn't pretty.

86
00:06:11,431 --> 00:06:17,394
[SPEAKER_10]: So, the second time around will be a lot better, and a lot cleaner, and should work.

87
00:06:17,755 --> 00:06:22,958
[SPEAKER_10]: But, when I actually get around to that, I don't know, because I have a lot of things I gotta work on, so.

88
00:06:23,978 --> 00:06:25,879
[SPEAKER_10]: It will not be forgotten.

89
00:06:26,079 --> 00:06:27,420
[SPEAKER_10]: It will be taken care of at some point.

90
00:06:27,622 --> 00:06:28,903
[SPEAKER_03]: Plus, it's just a busy time of year.

91
00:06:29,263 --> 00:06:31,305
[SPEAKER_03]: This isn't the best time to start a big project.

92
00:06:31,845 --> 00:06:32,966
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I have other projects.

93
00:06:33,527 --> 00:06:37,830
[SPEAKER_10]: I tend to start projects when I have other projects going and don't finish things.

94
00:06:38,591 --> 00:06:44,395
[SPEAKER_10]: I have my arcade cabinet, the actual arcade cabinet, that I've got everything almost ready for that.

95
00:06:44,416 --> 00:06:50,540
[SPEAKER_10]: I was just working on the front end to get some of the themes I had for a hyper-spin to work correctly.

96
00:06:52,262 --> 00:06:53,363
[SPEAKER_10]: Otherwise, it's ready to go.

97
00:06:53,983 --> 00:06:56,866
[SPEAKER_10]: So I may just play around with that, actually enjoy the fruits of my labor.

98
00:06:57,646 --> 00:07:00,330
[SPEAKER_10]: and then later on, you know, tackle this stuff.

99
00:07:00,470 --> 00:07:12,165
[SPEAKER_10]: Actually, for whatever reason on Impulse Buy, I purchased what they call a Dingo A320, which, you know, it's not an actual Dingo, but it's a little...

100
00:07:14,090 --> 00:07:14,690
[SPEAKER_10]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

101
00:07:34,122 --> 00:07:46,632
[SPEAKER_10]: I probably could turn that into a cabinet as well if I wanted to in place of this because I could hook up the video out to an old PS1 LCD monitor that I have still, so maybe.

102
00:07:47,073 --> 00:07:53,278
[SPEAKER_10]: But then again, you know, it's pretty nice and I don't want to kind of mess that up, so I'll just probably get another PSP and just do it.

103
00:07:53,958 --> 00:07:54,919
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll fix it this time.

104
00:07:55,540 --> 00:08:01,965
[SPEAKER_10]: But other than that, you know, that's pretty much what I've been doing other than, you know, grant the thought and stuff.

105
00:08:02,495 --> 00:08:02,836
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

106
00:08:03,357 --> 00:08:06,422
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I was going to get into Gaming Weeks, but you pretty much took the cake with that one.

107
00:08:06,462 --> 00:08:06,883
[SPEAKER_03]: That's alright.

108
00:08:07,324 --> 00:08:08,145
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's go over to Jamie.

109
00:08:09,407 --> 00:08:10,770
[SPEAKER_03]: How was your Gaming Week, DarkSakura?

110
00:08:11,251 --> 00:08:14,076
[SPEAKER_07]: I played World of Warcraft and knitted.

111
00:08:14,536 --> 00:08:15,138
[SPEAKER_07]: Or crocheted.

112
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:16,601
[SPEAKER_03]: Watch Dan play Borderlands.

113
00:08:42,839 --> 00:08:43,860
[SPEAKER_03]: I watched a little bit of that.

114
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:46,581
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not super familiar with Borderlands, although I've heard a lot of good things about it.

115
00:08:46,901 --> 00:08:49,123
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was watching Dan play a little bit of it as I was walking in tonight.

116
00:08:49,143 --> 00:08:52,824
[SPEAKER_03]: I like the Crazy Mutant Midgets.

117
00:08:52,844 --> 00:08:55,086
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that what they're actually called?

118
00:08:55,246 --> 00:08:57,027
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, the Crazy Mutant Midgets or something like that.

119
00:08:57,487 --> 00:08:57,787
[SPEAKER_03]: Amazing.

120
00:08:59,208 --> 00:09:00,508
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, was there anything else for your gaming week?

121
00:09:00,528 --> 00:09:02,449
[SPEAKER_03]: I know you're talking about hacks, but other games you've been playing?

122
00:09:02,970 --> 00:09:03,850
[SPEAKER_10]: Just Grand Theft Auto.

123
00:09:04,951 --> 00:09:05,751
[SPEAKER_10]: That's pretty much it.

124
00:09:07,670 --> 00:09:13,398
[SPEAKER_10]: All the opportunity that I had to play games this weekend, I was just too busy working on that stupid box cabinet thing.

125
00:09:13,911 --> 00:09:14,111
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.

126
00:09:15,531 --> 00:09:16,331
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see, My Gaming Week.

127
00:09:16,932 --> 00:09:17,752
[SPEAKER_03]: Two new games.

128
00:09:18,112 --> 00:09:20,332
[SPEAKER_03]: One, just a demo, so I can't really tell you about the game.

129
00:09:20,692 --> 00:09:22,253
[SPEAKER_03]: But the demo I played was Bayonetta.

130
00:09:22,753 --> 00:09:24,313
[SPEAKER_03]: And didn't know a whole lot about the game.

131
00:09:24,393 --> 00:09:28,114
[SPEAKER_03]: I kind of knew it was like a Devil May Cry-ish game with a hot chick as the main character.

132
00:09:28,134 --> 00:09:28,714
[SPEAKER_03]: It's awesome.

133
00:09:28,774 --> 00:09:30,574
[SPEAKER_03]: But I didn't know a whole lot about it.

134
00:09:30,854 --> 00:09:34,335
[SPEAKER_03]: But one of my friends was like, no, you really, really need to play this demo.

135
00:09:34,675 --> 00:09:35,555
[SPEAKER_03]: It's quite astounding.

136
00:09:35,875 --> 00:09:37,135
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was like, okay, I'll check it out.

137
00:09:37,215 --> 00:09:38,136
[SPEAKER_03]: What have I got to lose?

138
00:09:38,156 --> 00:09:39,096
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not paying anything for it.

139
00:09:39,416 --> 00:09:39,556
[SPEAKER_03]: So...

140
00:09:40,356 --> 00:09:41,177
[SPEAKER_03]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

141
00:10:02,691 --> 00:10:03,812
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

142
00:10:27,731 --> 00:10:28,492
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

143
00:10:58,231 --> 00:10:59,553
[SPEAKER_03]: It's so over the top.

144
00:10:59,813 --> 00:11:01,794
[SPEAKER_03]: I was laughing and laughing and laughing.

145
00:11:01,814 --> 00:11:10,641
[SPEAKER_03]: And just this move where you spin the controller like 360 degrees and hit one of the buttons and then she'll get on the ground and start... Her high heels are guns.

146
00:11:10,882 --> 00:11:14,625
[SPEAKER_03]: So she starts shooting from her high heels and you can actually aim at the monsters.

147
00:11:15,045 --> 00:11:17,967
[SPEAKER_03]: It is insanity and I loved every minute of it.

148
00:11:18,027 --> 00:11:22,851
[SPEAKER_03]: So I am so excited for the full version of the game because it was just so over the top.

149
00:11:22,891 --> 00:11:24,833
[SPEAKER_03]: And some of the boss fights were extremely silly.

150
00:11:25,533 --> 00:11:25,553
[SPEAKER_03]: I...

151
00:11:26,714 --> 00:11:35,180
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't believe how much I enjoyed this game because it's not usually the type of game I'm all into, but just the absurdness and over-the-topness and the design of the characters.

152
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:38,181
[SPEAKER_03]: I can see why now this game is getting all the praise it is.

153
00:11:39,962 --> 00:11:41,123
[SPEAKER_03]: I had a good time.

154
00:11:41,363 --> 00:11:43,305
[SPEAKER_03]: And by the way, did you notice she's wearing her hair?

155
00:11:43,765 --> 00:11:45,046
[SPEAKER_03]: Her hair is like her weapon.

156
00:11:45,106 --> 00:11:45,326
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

157
00:11:45,626 --> 00:11:48,948
[SPEAKER_03]: And she turns her hair into demons that will bite the heads off of monsters.

158
00:11:48,988 --> 00:11:49,608
[SPEAKER_07]: She has witch hair.

159
00:11:49,688 --> 00:11:52,850
[SPEAKER_03]: Which conveniently leaves her with a naked booty.

160
00:11:53,811 --> 00:11:54,772
[SPEAKER_03]: Or a thong or something.

161
00:11:56,429 --> 00:11:58,851
[SPEAKER_03]: Who would win in a fight, Bayonetta or the Baroness?

162
00:11:59,811 --> 00:12:04,215
[SPEAKER_03]: I would have to say Bayonetta is going to just kick her into a guillotine and snap her fingers and it's over.

163
00:12:04,655 --> 00:12:07,217
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, with all due respect to the Baroness.

164
00:12:07,798 --> 00:12:11,521
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess they're saying in chat room, TigerClaw says, Bayonetta looks like the Baroness.

165
00:12:12,442 --> 00:12:16,765
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you want to join us in our chat, chat.orangelawntrader.com, of course, is always a place you can do that.

166
00:12:17,846 --> 00:12:19,908
[SPEAKER_10]: And I really do need to play that game because I have my...

167
00:12:21,013 --> 00:12:22,214
[SPEAKER_10]: My Japanese 360 now.

168
00:12:22,334 --> 00:12:23,414
[SPEAKER_10]: And I actually do have the game.

169
00:12:23,474 --> 00:12:25,955
[SPEAKER_10]: I just haven't played it yet because I've been working on Crapply.

170
00:12:27,316 --> 00:12:33,519
[SPEAKER_03]: You really need to play it and seriously call me when you do because I want to hear your initial impressions before next week's show.

171
00:12:33,539 --> 00:12:34,680
[SPEAKER_07]: You need to bring it over.

172
00:12:36,041 --> 00:12:37,684
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I want to play the full one.

173
00:12:38,144 --> 00:12:38,605
[SPEAKER_03]: Looks like fun.

174
00:12:39,066 --> 00:12:41,369
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, anyhow, also my gaming week.

175
00:12:41,810 --> 00:12:45,816
[SPEAKER_03]: Not a demo, but a full game, and one I've been intending to play for a while.

176
00:12:46,237 --> 00:12:47,318
[SPEAKER_03]: New Super Mario Bros.

177
00:12:47,358 --> 00:12:50,683
[SPEAKER_03]: Wii, which was a game I played at E3, and I was kind of like, yeah, it's okay.

178
00:12:52,205 --> 00:13:00,011
[SPEAKER_03]: I played it with one of the nice booth babes there who was trying to show me the parts of the game and obviously I was getting into the multiplayer experience and I was like, yeah, it's okay.

179
00:13:00,391 --> 00:13:02,052
[SPEAKER_03]: But I wish that they would go back.

180
00:13:02,072 --> 00:13:03,633
[SPEAKER_03]: And I said this on the show a couple weeks ago.

181
00:13:03,673 --> 00:13:08,237
[SPEAKER_03]: I said, I really want them to go back and make like Super Mario Bros.

182
00:13:08,717 --> 00:13:09,418
[SPEAKER_03]: 4 or something like that.

183
00:13:09,438 --> 00:13:12,800
[SPEAKER_03]: Like a game like the old Mario Bros.

184
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:19,625
[SPEAKER_03]: that kind of, without all this extra frilly stuff that they've kind of done in some of the more recent Mario releases and 3D and all that stuff.

185
00:13:20,286 --> 00:13:20,406
[SPEAKER_03]: And

186
00:13:21,997 --> 00:13:23,598
[SPEAKER_03]: I have to admit, I was wrong.

187
00:13:23,938 --> 00:13:24,758
[SPEAKER_03]: This is that game.

188
00:13:39,423 --> 00:13:40,384
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

189
00:13:59,454 --> 00:14:00,275
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

190
00:14:19,427 --> 00:14:27,695
[SPEAKER_03]: And as I heard Bobby mention on his show, of course, Bobby Blackwolf's always on before we are at All Games Radio when we broadcast live on Sunday nights.

191
00:14:28,015 --> 00:14:31,479
[SPEAKER_03]: He was kind of talking about how there wasn't really a tutorial mode.

192
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:34,221
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you've never played a Mario game before, there's a lot of stuff you miss.

193
00:14:34,582 --> 00:14:35,623
[SPEAKER_03]: And I kind of agree with that.

194
00:14:35,663 --> 00:14:42,829
[SPEAKER_03]: Like if the game has one flaw, it was that I didn't know you could hit the A button to avoid death in multiplayer mode until...

195
00:14:43,590 --> 00:14:45,371
[SPEAKER_03]: A little ways into it, playing with friends.

196
00:14:45,411 --> 00:14:47,451
[SPEAKER_03]: And I suppose the discovery of it was okay.

197
00:14:47,511 --> 00:14:55,034
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, I would have liked, since this is supposed to be something for everyone, there to be a little more of a basic tutorial mode.

198
00:14:55,614 --> 00:15:03,697
[SPEAKER_03]: But honestly, that's a very minor flaw in what is otherwise a stellar game and just a really fun multiplayer experience with a lot of variety.

199
00:15:03,717 --> 00:15:06,918
[SPEAKER_03]: There's some new suits, like the propeller suit and the penguin suit.

200
00:15:07,319 --> 00:15:09,599
[SPEAKER_03]: And now you have ice balls as well as fireballs.

201
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:10,260
[SPEAKER_03]: And

202
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:11,740
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

203
00:15:27,691 --> 00:15:29,192
[SPEAKER_03]: Really happy for this game.

204
00:15:29,812 --> 00:15:30,753
[SPEAKER_03]: Reading some comments from chat.

205
00:15:30,793 --> 00:15:33,735
[SPEAKER_03]: Zappy says, I guess Sky never played New Super Mario Bros.

206
00:15:33,775 --> 00:15:34,215
[SPEAKER_03]: on the DS.

207
00:15:34,776 --> 00:15:35,576
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, that's not true.

208
00:15:35,776 --> 00:15:37,057
[SPEAKER_03]: I did play it on the DS.

209
00:15:37,738 --> 00:15:42,240
[SPEAKER_03]: But you have to kind of go back and remember that I have an extreme bias against handheld games.

210
00:15:42,681 --> 00:15:46,003
[SPEAKER_03]: Especially when they are porting over games that I remember from consoles.

211
00:15:46,063 --> 00:15:49,565
[SPEAKER_03]: And I am the first to admit, it's completely irrational and stupid.

212
00:15:50,105 --> 00:15:56,389
[SPEAKER_03]: But I don't like games I remember from my television playing big on my big sound speaker, larger than life.

213
00:15:57,523 --> 00:15:58,484
[SPEAKER_03]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

214
00:16:23,103 --> 00:16:25,424
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see, trying to look for some other questions from chat.

215
00:16:26,845 --> 00:16:27,366
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see.

216
00:16:29,207 --> 00:16:32,329
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, if you want to join our chat, chat.orangelongeradio.com.

217
00:16:33,390 --> 00:16:34,750
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think they're talking about some other games.

218
00:16:34,770 --> 00:16:38,213
[SPEAKER_03]: They're talking about Tekken and stuff in chat right now, which I did not play during my gaming week.

219
00:16:38,773 --> 00:16:47,879
[SPEAKER_03]: But between those couple games and a little bit of other things here and there, not a whole lot of other major games this week, but I really enjoyed Super Mario Bros.

220
00:16:47,919 --> 00:16:48,079
[SPEAKER_03]: Wii.

221
00:16:48,339 --> 00:16:49,019
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know what's weird?

222
00:16:49,059 --> 00:16:49,420
[SPEAKER_03]: Because...

223
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:52,501
[SPEAKER_03]: Every time... I know we've given Nintendo a hard time on this show.

224
00:16:52,761 --> 00:17:04,023
[SPEAKER_03]: And we've come on here and we've said, you know, Nintendo is so out of touch with gaming, they don't, you know, they're not getting it, and Microsoft and Sony are doing all these things online that are, you know, miles ahead of what the Wii is doing.

225
00:17:04,083 --> 00:17:09,704
[SPEAKER_03]: But then, damn, they always release a game like this that really reminds you they do know how to do fun.

226
00:17:10,305 --> 00:17:11,525
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just that, unfortunately, it's...

227
00:17:12,185 --> 00:17:16,347
[SPEAKER_03]: You only get a couple of these releases a year that kind of remind you of that fact.

228
00:17:17,307 --> 00:17:20,768
[SPEAKER_03]: But I do recommend the game, especially if you played Mario 1 growing up.

229
00:17:20,848 --> 00:17:25,150
[SPEAKER_03]: If you have that same desire I have, God, I wish they'd make a game like Mario 3 or Mario World again.

230
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:25,930
[SPEAKER_03]: This is that game.

231
00:17:26,371 --> 00:17:28,511
[SPEAKER_03]: And then there's multiplayer in it to boot that's actually kind of fun.

232
00:17:29,032 --> 00:17:31,953
[SPEAKER_03]: Except for the fact that the princess isn't in it, but she got kidnapped again.

233
00:17:32,053 --> 00:17:32,433
[SPEAKER_03]: What can you do?

234
00:17:33,663 --> 00:17:34,003
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura.com

235
00:17:47,948 --> 00:17:48,228
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see.

236
00:17:48,488 --> 00:17:49,129
[SPEAKER_03]: Comment from chat.

237
00:17:49,189 --> 00:17:50,729
[SPEAKER_03]: Ricky Go Max says, I would play that.

238
00:17:50,789 --> 00:17:51,570
[SPEAKER_03]: Peach's Quest.

239
00:17:51,850 --> 00:17:53,410
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, there was a game like that on DS.

240
00:17:54,131 --> 00:17:56,212
[SPEAKER_03]: Speaking of DS and everything.

241
00:17:56,372 --> 00:17:57,372
[SPEAKER_03]: There was a Princess Peach game.

242
00:17:57,392 --> 00:17:58,613
[SPEAKER_03]: Super Princess Peach, wasn't it called?

243
00:17:59,673 --> 00:18:00,393
[SPEAKER_03]: It was different, though.

244
00:18:00,654 --> 00:18:01,914
[SPEAKER_03]: It wasn't really a Mario game.

245
00:18:01,954 --> 00:18:05,276
[SPEAKER_03]: See, that was one of those Nintendo trying to take a Mario thing.

246
00:18:06,256 --> 00:18:08,497
[SPEAKER_03]: It was okay, but it wasn't Mario Brothers.

247
00:18:08,637 --> 00:18:09,677
[SPEAKER_07]: It was Super PMS.

248
00:18:11,018 --> 00:18:12,279
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, she used her emotions.

249
00:18:12,319 --> 00:18:14,179
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember the emotions was a big part of that game.

250
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:15,060
[SPEAKER_03]: A little silly.

251
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:19,244
[SPEAKER_03]: So anyhow, let's get into some housekeeping tonight.

252
00:18:19,545 --> 00:18:20,586
[SPEAKER_03]: Some housekeeping I wanted to state.

253
00:18:20,666 --> 00:18:22,448
[SPEAKER_03]: We will not be live next week.

254
00:18:22,488 --> 00:18:25,192
[SPEAKER_03]: We will not have a live show next week, and that's completely my fault.

255
00:18:25,652 --> 00:18:28,195
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to be out of town next Sunday.

256
00:18:28,936 --> 00:18:33,041
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really no secret I'm going to see Lady Gaga in concert, and I couldn't be more excited.

257
00:18:33,101 --> 00:18:33,722
[SPEAKER_03]: So sorry, guys.

258
00:18:34,383 --> 00:18:35,264
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

259
00:18:56,781 --> 00:18:58,142
[SPEAKER_03]: Ask All Games if we can go live.

260
00:18:58,182 --> 00:19:01,303
[SPEAKER_03]: So stay tuned to our Twitter and our Facebook.

261
00:19:01,603 --> 00:19:06,044
[SPEAKER_03]: Twitter.com slash OLR and Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio, all one word.

262
00:19:06,725 --> 00:19:11,106
[SPEAKER_03]: And of course our website, OrangeLoungeRadio.com for the details on when that pre-taping will happen.

263
00:19:11,687 --> 00:19:16,608
[SPEAKER_03]: So again, if you are used to coming here Sunday nights and listening, you're still going to get a new show next week.

264
00:19:16,648 --> 00:19:17,929
[SPEAKER_03]: You will hear a new show Sunday night.

265
00:19:18,269 --> 00:19:19,489
[SPEAKER_03]: It just won't be live.

266
00:19:19,710 --> 00:19:20,190
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know...

267
00:19:21,030 --> 00:19:21,690
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for watching!

268
00:19:44,645 --> 00:19:49,490
[SPEAKER_10]: So starting things off, this is kind of interesting, but not too surprising.

269
00:19:49,830 --> 00:19:53,554
[SPEAKER_10]: Games for Windows Live, they've decided to add Games on Demand.

270
00:19:53,954 --> 00:20:01,021
[SPEAKER_10]: You may remember that's a service that's been available right now on Xbox Live as their kind of digital download service.

271
00:20:01,601 --> 00:20:09,409
[SPEAKER_10]: And of course, trying to compete with Steam a little bit, I think, they're going to start doing their Games on Demand service starting the beginning of December 15th.

272
00:20:11,218 --> 00:20:32,234
[SPEAKER_10]: and apparently some of the games that they're talking about adding for the initial lineup is going to be Resident Evil 5, Red Faction Guerrilla, Battle Stations Pacific, as well as some Game for Windows Live enabled versions of World of Goo and Osmos.

273
00:20:33,955 --> 00:20:34,175
[SPEAKER_09]: Hmm.

274
00:20:35,396 --> 00:20:35,516
[SPEAKER_10]: And...

275
00:20:37,386 --> 00:20:38,567
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know, that's kind of interesting.

276
00:20:38,607 --> 00:20:42,912
[SPEAKER_10]: They haven't really said any prices yet on what the games will cost.

277
00:20:43,013 --> 00:20:47,558
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I imagine a lot of it's going to be competitively priced or similar to what you see on store shelves.

278
00:20:48,679 --> 00:20:50,481
[SPEAKER_03]: That's pretty much what we've come to expect from Steam.

279
00:20:50,802 --> 00:20:55,227
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think a large reason people really like Steam is that they do sales all the freaking time.

280
00:20:55,447 --> 00:21:01,151
[SPEAKER_10]: And if I remember correctly, I believe, isn't Games for Windows Live kind of tied in with Windows 7 a little bit?

281
00:21:01,191 --> 00:21:09,956
[SPEAKER_10]: Because I remember when they were showing us some of the stuff for Windows 7, there was kind of that game marketplace or whatever that you could download, like a bunch of casual stuff and whatnot.

282
00:21:10,377 --> 00:21:13,399
[SPEAKER_03]: I just upgraded to 7 a week ago.

283
00:21:13,419 --> 00:21:14,059
[SPEAKER_03]: Well...

284
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:44,849
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been running it on my laptop because remember we got the release candidate at E3 like many of you out there on the internet downloaded so I've been running that on my laptop for some time ever since I got it in July and that's what made me decide that I like Windows 7 I like it much more than the jump from XP to Vista because what I liked about 7 is it takes the best parts of Vista and what you remember liking about XP kind of puts it together the one thing I don't like about 7 is I cannot stand these administrator privileges things I want to freaking get them removed

285
00:21:45,289 --> 00:21:47,192
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the one thing I didn't... It's in Vista too.

286
00:21:47,492 --> 00:21:47,913
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I know.

287
00:21:47,933 --> 00:21:49,896
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't like it in Vista either.

288
00:21:50,196 --> 00:21:51,718
[SPEAKER_03]: There should be a way I can disable that crap.

289
00:21:51,738 --> 00:21:52,500
[SPEAKER_07]: You can't disable it.

290
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:53,281
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you?

291
00:21:53,501 --> 00:21:57,306
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, in Vista, all you have to do is make yourself full administrator and then just do...

292
00:21:58,913 --> 00:22:02,716
[SPEAKER_07]: It took me a while to change it, to find where to change it, but it is there.

293
00:22:02,836 --> 00:22:03,356
[SPEAKER_07]: It should be there.

294
00:22:03,396 --> 00:22:08,880
[SPEAKER_03]: To be fair, I haven't looked hard enough, and I'm sure our chat room is going to light up with comments on things I could be doing better in a minute here.

295
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:10,761
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'll have to look into that in the next week.

296
00:22:10,781 --> 00:22:16,185
[SPEAKER_03]: But I was just having problems because it was not letting me delete World of Warcraft folders because it said I didn't create them.

297
00:22:16,505 --> 00:22:21,808
[SPEAKER_03]: And I had to go in this really – like I had to right-click on the folder, go into properties, make myself the new owner.

298
00:22:21,888 --> 00:22:22,869
[SPEAKER_03]: It was ridiculous.

299
00:22:23,089 --> 00:22:25,911
[SPEAKER_03]: I should just be able to hit the delete key and nuke the fucking folder.

300
00:22:26,011 --> 00:22:28,894
[SPEAKER_03]: I should not have to jump hurdles to delete my own goddamn game.

301
00:22:29,134 --> 00:22:29,434
[SPEAKER_03]: You know?

302
00:22:29,634 --> 00:22:30,135
[SPEAKER_03]: It's stupid.

303
00:22:30,435 --> 00:22:31,436
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the one drawback.

304
00:22:31,516 --> 00:22:32,617
[SPEAKER_03]: Otherwise, I love Windows 7.

305
00:22:34,639 --> 00:22:38,622
[SPEAKER_03]: And to be fair, Vista has a lot of that administrative... So, you know what?

306
00:22:40,764 --> 00:22:42,345
[SPEAKER_07]: Just run Linux Mint, Rob.

307
00:22:44,026 --> 00:22:45,808
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not going to run Linux Mint on a desktop.

308
00:22:46,008 --> 00:22:50,071
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd run it on my laptop, but running that stuff on my desktop, I can't do it.

309
00:22:50,592 --> 00:22:51,953
[SPEAKER_07]: It will run more efficiently...

310
00:22:52,955 --> 00:22:53,575
[SPEAKER_03]: On a laptop?

311
00:22:53,876 --> 00:22:54,016
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

312
00:22:54,096 --> 00:22:54,516
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't.

313
00:22:54,616 --> 00:22:55,496
[SPEAKER_03]: It runs more efficiently.

314
00:22:55,516 --> 00:22:56,957
[SPEAKER_03]: Why don't you run it on your desktop then?

315
00:22:57,097 --> 00:22:59,318
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I actually have to have programs that use a Windows environment.

316
00:22:59,398 --> 00:23:02,740
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I use a lot of movie makers and stuff like that that's Windows environment.

317
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:04,681
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, that's where I'm coming from.

318
00:23:05,101 --> 00:23:10,084
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, for a laptop though, like, you know, I kind of like... Mint 8's out now.

319
00:23:11,253 --> 00:23:16,535
[SPEAKER_03]: I know you're not a big fan of Google Chrome, but I like where that's headed as far as a laptop OS goes.

320
00:23:16,915 --> 00:23:22,337
[SPEAKER_03]: That it's just the internet, the documents, the stuff you want to do on the go.

321
00:23:23,817 --> 00:23:27,879
[SPEAKER_03]: But I could never... God, Google Chrome, I could never run on a desktop.

322
00:23:28,979 --> 00:23:31,320
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think that it's actually meant for desktop use though.

323
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:32,141
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think so either.

324
00:23:32,241 --> 00:23:35,482
[SPEAKER_07]: But Mint is fairly versatile.

325
00:23:36,002 --> 00:23:54,771
[SPEAKER_07]: In fact, actually the other thing that I was going to be doing with my computer when the semester's over is actually doing a second install for Mint 8 because I was going to run some of the Windows emulated environments because apparently they actually run pretty well using less system resource than Vista or Windows 7 does.

326
00:23:55,451 --> 00:23:55,591
[SPEAKER_07]: Hmm.

327
00:23:55,971 --> 00:23:59,812
[SPEAKER_07]: So, actually, all those 5 gigs of RAM, I can actually use it for my graphics programs.

328
00:24:00,913 --> 00:24:03,634
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I might give it a try.

329
00:24:05,054 --> 00:24:07,035
[SPEAKER_07]: I am not a fan of Windows.

330
00:24:08,255 --> 00:24:09,496
[SPEAKER_07]: I use it out of necessity.

331
00:24:10,236 --> 00:24:12,337
[SPEAKER_07]: And lately, I've been even less of a fan of macOS.

332
00:24:13,577 --> 00:24:18,599
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, there's things I really, really like about the Mac, and there's things I really, really don't like about the Mac.

333
00:24:19,721 --> 00:24:20,201
[SPEAKER_03]: Me too.

334
00:24:21,001 --> 00:24:35,044
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, it's one thing that I've actually been pretty happy that finally Adobe has gotten their crap together and made CS4 actually really, really wonderfully compatible with a PC environment.

335
00:24:35,304 --> 00:24:37,164
[SPEAKER_07]: It's got everything optimized for your graphics cards.

336
00:24:37,344 --> 00:24:47,306
[SPEAKER_07]: I can run Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign, and Corel Painter and the internet and AIM and all this other crap at the same time without my system just farting.

337
00:24:47,906 --> 00:24:48,166
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.

338
00:24:48,626 --> 00:24:48,786
[SPEAKER_02]: So...

339
00:24:49,741 --> 00:24:49,961
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

340
00:24:50,422 --> 00:24:53,764
[SPEAKER_03]: And just another quick note, because I see a lot of chatter saying that they're hearing a lot of typing.

341
00:24:53,905 --> 00:24:58,789
[SPEAKER_03]: I think something's up with Jamie's mic tonight, and it's more sensitive than usual, which is strange, because we didn't change any of the dials.

342
00:24:58,829 --> 00:25:01,011
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, things happen when things get shifted around.

343
00:25:01,291 --> 00:25:03,052
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think it's just ultra sensitive tonight.

344
00:25:03,072 --> 00:25:04,734
[SPEAKER_10]: And I've been typing on the microphone.

345
00:25:05,996 --> 00:25:06,136
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

346
00:25:06,456 --> 00:25:09,379
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm just saying, we know you guys are hearing it, we just don't know why.

347
00:25:09,499 --> 00:25:14,303
[SPEAKER_03]: So one of the beauties of live radio is that sometimes we have to figure things out on the fly.

348
00:25:14,323 --> 00:25:16,385
[SPEAKER_10]: It's the whole newsroom vibe, okay?

349
00:25:16,445 --> 00:25:16,645
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

350
00:25:16,665 --> 00:25:19,488
[SPEAKER_10]: It's the typewriters.

351
00:25:19,548 --> 00:25:20,789
[SPEAKER_03]: Live for the OLR newsroom.

352
00:25:20,809 --> 00:25:25,032
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, we just totally need to have the Morse code ticker going in the background.

353
00:25:25,052 --> 00:25:26,634
[SPEAKER_03]: Good night and have a pleasant tomorrow.

354
00:25:29,747 --> 00:25:35,811
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyhow, sorry, going back to games for Windows Live, because damn, we got on a whole tangent about Windows 7.

355
00:25:36,111 --> 00:25:41,555
[SPEAKER_03]: The point I was trying to get to earlier, I've been running Windows 7 for months now and I haven't seen it.

356
00:25:41,996 --> 00:25:44,517
[SPEAKER_03]: There was the point I was trying to make seven minutes ago.

357
00:25:46,419 --> 00:25:52,303
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, the other thing I wanted to say, though, about this, Loki, I don't think you really use any of this stuff.

358
00:25:52,823 --> 00:25:53,944
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you even have a Steam account?

359
00:25:53,964 --> 00:25:54,004
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

360
00:25:56,056 --> 00:25:56,296
[SPEAKER_03]: Nope.

361
00:25:56,636 --> 00:25:57,557
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I figured.

362
00:25:58,097 --> 00:25:59,137
[SPEAKER_03]: Why would you have a Steam account?

363
00:25:59,758 --> 00:26:01,058
[SPEAKER_10]: Why would I pay for software?

364
00:26:01,278 --> 00:26:02,019
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

365
00:26:02,399 --> 00:26:04,740
[SPEAKER_03]: Call it supporting developers, maybe?

366
00:26:04,860 --> 00:26:05,260
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

367
00:26:05,340 --> 00:26:05,780
[SPEAKER_03]: Call me crazy.

368
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:08,361
[SPEAKER_10]: Honestly, I don't play enough PC games to have that.

369
00:26:08,622 --> 00:26:15,265
[SPEAKER_03]: Final Fantasy XI is the last PC game I remember you actually playing more than an hour of.

370
00:26:16,205 --> 00:26:17,906
[SPEAKER_10]: I played Crysis and Spore.

371
00:26:21,578 --> 00:26:26,881
[SPEAKER_10]: Actually, the last Games for Windows live game that I purchased was Grand Theft Auto 4 for the PC.

372
00:26:27,621 --> 00:26:28,022
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, okay.

373
00:26:28,202 --> 00:26:43,670
[SPEAKER_10]: And I actually stopped playing that because I got tired of trying to monkey with stuff to get it to... I don't know why games nowadays, some of them don't support multiple graphics cards.

374
00:26:43,950 --> 00:26:45,591
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's really sad that they don't.

375
00:26:46,991 --> 00:26:47,531
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

376
00:27:07,809 --> 00:27:08,790
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't buy computers.

377
00:27:08,810 --> 00:27:09,991
[SPEAKER_03]: You build computers.

378
00:27:10,151 --> 00:27:11,933
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I should have built the goddamn computer.

379
00:27:13,134 --> 00:27:15,796
[SPEAKER_03]: It was $800, and I was like, oh, this is a great deal.

380
00:27:15,836 --> 00:27:17,117
[SPEAKER_03]: It's got like six gigs of RAM.

381
00:27:17,157 --> 00:27:18,499
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, I can't build one that cheap.

382
00:27:18,559 --> 00:27:19,299
[SPEAKER_03]: I was stupid.

383
00:27:19,379 --> 00:27:19,940
[SPEAKER_03]: You can.

384
00:27:20,020 --> 00:27:20,921
[SPEAKER_03]: Bad judgment.

385
00:27:21,061 --> 00:27:21,561
[SPEAKER_03]: I admit it.

386
00:27:22,662 --> 00:27:26,746
[SPEAKER_03]: How dare I doubt the great and mighty Loki, and I pay for it every day of my life.

387
00:27:26,846 --> 00:27:27,387
[SPEAKER_10]: I just built...

388
00:27:28,735 --> 00:27:29,235
[SPEAKER_10]: Lesson learned.

389
00:27:30,817 --> 00:27:33,078
[SPEAKER_10]: I just built a PC for my mom, actually.

390
00:27:33,359 --> 00:27:39,663
[SPEAKER_10]: It's sadly almost, well, not quite up to spec to what mine is, because mine was built for gaming, but $350.

391
00:27:41,004 --> 00:27:44,827
[SPEAKER_10]: It gets incredibly cheap to do it nowadays.

392
00:27:45,348 --> 00:27:49,851
[SPEAKER_10]: If you actually go piece by piece of what they actually include in there, you can see where they're cutting corners.

393
00:27:50,192 --> 00:27:57,918
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I need a new video card, because Dragon Age kind of runs like balls on my computer, but then I watched my friend play it on his computer this weekend, and it's like, oh, beautiful.

394
00:27:58,698 --> 00:28:00,960
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can do rotating and things that you can't do on the console.

395
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,961
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm like, must play Dragon Age.

396
00:28:02,981 --> 00:28:03,841
[SPEAKER_02]: This game is beautiful.

397
00:28:04,402 --> 00:28:04,882
[SPEAKER_02]: And I can't.

398
00:28:05,543 --> 00:28:07,944
[SPEAKER_02]: Because my video card is balls because I didn't trust Loki.

399
00:28:09,885 --> 00:28:10,226
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyhow.

400
00:28:10,426 --> 00:28:12,087
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, that'll be the last time they do that.

401
00:28:12,830 --> 00:28:13,771
[SPEAKER_03]: Akira Yamaoka Akira Yamaoka

402
00:28:32,794 --> 00:28:33,914
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

403
00:28:55,422 --> 00:28:59,543
[SPEAKER_03]: OutSourced it, or well, not outsourced it, but had a US developer do Homecoming or what have you.

404
00:29:00,023 --> 00:29:01,624
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't know, maybe that's part of what ticked him off.

405
00:29:01,744 --> 00:29:02,364
[SPEAKER_03]: I have no idea.

406
00:29:02,464 --> 00:29:04,025
[SPEAKER_03]: Or maybe, you know, after 16 years he wanted a new job.

407
00:29:04,045 --> 00:29:06,325
[SPEAKER_07]: That he just doesn't get along with people from what I understand.

408
00:29:06,505 --> 00:29:06,765
[SPEAKER_03]: Really?

409
00:29:07,366 --> 00:29:10,727
[SPEAKER_03]: Well... He was nice at E3 that one year we randomly met him.

410
00:29:10,867 --> 00:29:12,227
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, he was pretty cool.

411
00:29:12,347 --> 00:29:14,168
[SPEAKER_07]: And I mean, I was like, ha ha ha.

412
00:29:15,068 --> 00:29:16,628
[SPEAKER_07]: But anyway... In your pants.

413
00:29:18,129 --> 00:29:24,591
[SPEAKER_07]: But seriously, I just, you know, maybe he just got tired of dealing with all the crap going on.

414
00:29:25,359 --> 00:29:26,060
[SPEAKER_02]: And we don't know.

415
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:28,442
[SPEAKER_03]: We can speculate until the cows come home, but we don't know.

416
00:29:28,482 --> 00:29:29,784
[SPEAKER_03]: There's been no official statement made.

417
00:29:30,044 --> 00:29:33,227
[SPEAKER_03]: But you also look at it and go, okay, he was there for, what, 16 years?

418
00:29:33,688 --> 00:29:35,750
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, that's a long time to be at any job.

419
00:29:36,211 --> 00:29:37,752
[SPEAKER_03]: And sometimes people just want to change.

420
00:29:38,173 --> 00:29:44,419
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe he's doing that whole thing where it's like, okay, I've been with this band, and now I want to split off and make a solo album.

421
00:29:44,439 --> 00:29:44,880
[SPEAKER_03]: And...

422
00:29:46,141 --> 00:29:46,982
[SPEAKER_03]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

423
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:06,982
[SPEAKER_03]: And he scored things even all the way back to the 8-bit days.

424
00:30:07,602 --> 00:30:12,166
[SPEAKER_03]: I know he did the Contra game that was on... He did some of Super Contra's soundtrack, I think.

425
00:30:12,406 --> 00:30:14,087
[SPEAKER_03]: He's just done a lot of stuff over the years.

426
00:30:14,147 --> 00:30:16,149
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure the wiki has the whole list about that.

427
00:30:17,950 --> 00:30:18,711
[SPEAKER_03]: We wish him the best.

428
00:30:18,771 --> 00:30:20,632
[SPEAKER_03]: Good luck to Akira Yamaoka.

429
00:30:20,933 --> 00:30:24,796
[SPEAKER_03]: And again, we would really like to see you form a new studio and make some more scary games.

430
00:30:24,976 --> 00:30:25,616
[SPEAKER_07]: He should hire me.

431
00:30:26,577 --> 00:30:26,917
[SPEAKER_03]: He should.

432
00:30:27,397 --> 00:30:27,658
[SPEAKER_07]: He should.

433
00:30:27,678 --> 00:30:28,498
[SPEAKER_03]: He should hire me, too.

434
00:30:28,578 --> 00:30:33,142
[SPEAKER_07]: I am particularly crazy enough to be able to help with the whole Silent Hill... Anyway.

435
00:30:34,124 --> 00:30:35,385
[SPEAKER_03]: You just want to be raped by Pyramid Head.

436
00:30:36,426 --> 00:30:36,706
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

437
00:30:39,047 --> 00:30:39,468
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

438
00:30:42,009 --> 00:30:43,511
[SPEAKER_07]: Not just no, but no.

439
00:30:43,531 --> 00:30:44,231
[SPEAKER_07]: Ew.

440
00:30:45,692 --> 00:30:49,094
[SPEAKER_10]: One does not just ask Pyramid Head to rape them.

441
00:30:49,875 --> 00:30:52,597
[SPEAKER_03]: Besides that, he has... You have to be chosen by Pyramid Head.

442
00:30:52,617 --> 00:30:55,479
[SPEAKER_07]: Besides that, he only bones the monsters.

443
00:30:55,839 --> 00:30:56,319
[SPEAKER_03]: Ah, I see.

444
00:30:57,880 --> 00:30:58,581
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not a nurse.

445
00:30:58,701 --> 00:30:59,041
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry.

446
00:31:00,322 --> 00:31:02,344
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, how about some game banning?

447
00:31:03,422 --> 00:31:03,962
[SPEAKER_07]: or not.

448
00:31:04,363 --> 00:31:05,123
[SPEAKER_07]: This is stupid.

449
00:31:06,044 --> 00:31:13,148
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, so the Australian classification board says that Sega can't have it for Aliens vs. Predators.

450
00:31:13,188 --> 00:31:16,070
[SPEAKER_07]: That means that they actually cannot sell it in Australia the way it is now.

451
00:31:16,090 --> 00:31:16,931
[SPEAKER_07]: It's...

452
00:31:19,392 --> 00:31:34,882
[SPEAKER_07]: They're saying that because you've got human beings being tortured and violated and decapitated and dismembered and lots of stabbing through different parts of the body that no.

453
00:31:35,403 --> 00:31:35,863
[SPEAKER_07]: They said no.

454
00:31:36,523 --> 00:31:40,406
[SPEAKER_07]: And Sega Australia is like, we're going to still appeal it.

455
00:31:41,087 --> 00:31:42,287
[SPEAKER_07]: because this is kind of stupid.

456
00:31:42,367 --> 00:31:45,648
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, and that's just what you do when your game gets a bad rating.

457
00:31:45,688 --> 00:31:55,591
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, have we ever heard a game company ever in the history of this show, you know, XY game gets banned and the company says, ah, okay, well, you know, these things happen.

458
00:31:55,731 --> 00:31:56,471
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we try it.

459
00:31:57,112 --> 00:31:57,512
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right.

460
00:31:57,592 --> 00:31:58,252
[SPEAKER_03]: Nope, cancel it.

461
00:31:58,792 --> 00:31:59,832
[SPEAKER_03]: Merry Christmas to you now.

462
00:31:59,972 --> 00:32:00,232
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh well.

463
00:32:00,593 --> 00:32:01,333
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh well.

464
00:32:01,373 --> 00:32:01,873
[SPEAKER_03]: Happy Christmas.

465
00:32:03,067 --> 00:32:04,708
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a ballsy thing to do.

466
00:32:04,728 --> 00:32:04,808
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

467
00:32:04,868 --> 00:32:05,009
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

468
00:32:25,612 --> 00:32:28,593
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, one thing I got to see this week was the Left 4 Dead.

469
00:32:28,613 --> 00:32:29,574
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's on YouTube.

470
00:32:29,594 --> 00:32:36,637
[SPEAKER_03]: If you go look for the Left 4 Dead 2, you can look at the censored version in Australia and kind of compare it to the regular one.

471
00:32:37,157 --> 00:32:40,699
[SPEAKER_03]: And, man, you guys in Australia got shafted on Left 4 Dead 2.

472
00:32:41,319 --> 00:32:43,400
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like the zombies, like, disappear.

473
00:32:43,980 --> 00:32:48,342
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, I was waiting for the bodies to flicker before they disappear, like it was Double Dragon or something.

474
00:32:48,402 --> 00:32:53,444
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it was not pleasant how desanitized they had to make that game.

475
00:32:53,784 --> 00:32:54,485
[SPEAKER_03]: It's unfortunate.

476
00:32:54,505 --> 00:32:55,005
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you still want to...

477
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:59,181
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like the dingo ate my decapitation scenes.

478
00:32:59,281 --> 00:33:01,122
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you still want to go over there?

479
00:33:01,862 --> 00:33:02,502
[SPEAKER_03]: What, to Australia?

480
00:33:02,642 --> 00:33:02,822
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

481
00:33:02,842 --> 00:33:03,803
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I want to go visit.

482
00:33:04,183 --> 00:33:04,943
[SPEAKER_07]: But you don't want to live there.

483
00:33:05,043 --> 00:33:08,744
[SPEAKER_03]: That's because I have an unhealthy obsession with a lot of Australian movies over the years.

484
00:33:10,465 --> 00:33:12,625
[SPEAKER_03]: And I want to see somebody play a didgeridoo.

485
00:33:13,365 --> 00:33:16,026
[SPEAKER_07]: Did I tell you I saw someone play a didgeridoo at school?

486
00:33:16,166 --> 00:33:17,967
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not authentic if it's not in Australia.

487
00:33:18,447 --> 00:33:22,188
[SPEAKER_03]: Just like if you have a pineapple here, it's not the same as having a pineapple in Hawaii.

488
00:33:22,228 --> 00:33:22,568
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry.

489
00:33:22,768 --> 00:33:24,689
[SPEAKER_07]: But he built it out of PVC pipe.

490
00:33:26,414 --> 00:33:27,675
[SPEAKER_03]: That's not a didgeridoo.

491
00:33:27,715 --> 00:33:31,738
[SPEAKER_07]: But it sounded right and the guy was sitting outside at school.

492
00:33:31,758 --> 00:33:33,320
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a PVC redo or something.

493
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:35,401
[SPEAKER_03]: PVC redo.

494
00:33:35,561 --> 00:33:36,142
[SPEAKER_07]: Didgeridoo.

495
00:33:37,643 --> 00:33:38,564
[SPEAKER_07]: I took a picture of it too.

496
00:33:39,624 --> 00:33:40,105
[SPEAKER_07]: It was funny.

497
00:33:41,397 --> 00:33:42,738
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow, wow, wow.

498
00:33:42,818 --> 00:33:44,018
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, look, people, you know what?

499
00:33:44,579 --> 00:33:51,062
[SPEAKER_03]: If this game comes out on PC, which almost all these games do nowadays, what's going to stop them from just importing the PC version of the game?

500
00:33:51,142 --> 00:33:53,944
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, do they region lock out PC games?

501
00:33:54,144 --> 00:33:55,685
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think that's a very easy thing to do.

502
00:33:55,705 --> 00:33:56,225
[SPEAKER_03]: No, you can't.

503
00:33:56,425 --> 00:33:57,346
[SPEAKER_03]: There is no regions.

504
00:33:57,766 --> 00:33:59,407
[SPEAKER_07]: You can if it runs on a DVD.

505
00:34:00,847 --> 00:34:01,668
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I guess that makes sense.

506
00:34:02,352 --> 00:34:06,394
[SPEAKER_03]: But isn't Australia... Australia's in the same region as Britain though, right?

507
00:34:06,414 --> 00:34:10,116
[SPEAKER_10]: But you can't... No, if it's on DVD, DVD video only has regions.

508
00:34:10,177 --> 00:34:12,198
[SPEAKER_10]: DVD software does not have regions at all.

509
00:34:13,218 --> 00:34:16,160
[SPEAKER_10]: So there's no way to lock out anything.

510
00:34:16,340 --> 00:34:20,582
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess maybe because we're thinking like PS2 would do the region lockouts, but of course that's different.

511
00:34:21,023 --> 00:34:21,343
[SPEAKER_03]: Interesting.

512
00:34:21,363 --> 00:34:26,586
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, and even if they did, it would just get bypassed so easy it's not even worth it.

513
00:34:27,925 --> 00:34:31,026
[SPEAKER_03]: Somebody in the chat room, of course, made the reference to Didgeridoo Techno.

514
00:34:31,446 --> 00:34:35,747
[SPEAKER_03]: I was an inside joke on this show from like a year and a half ago, but maybe we'll have to play that on break tonight.

515
00:34:36,308 --> 00:34:36,888
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been a little while.

516
00:34:37,108 --> 00:34:38,588
[SPEAKER_07]: And don't forget the references to Kylie.

517
00:34:38,688 --> 00:34:40,149
[SPEAKER_03]: We haven't had Didgeridoo Techno in a while.

518
00:34:40,169 --> 00:34:41,509
[SPEAKER_07]: We should play some Kylie during the break.

519
00:34:41,789 --> 00:34:42,129
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see.

520
00:34:43,230 --> 00:34:47,091
[SPEAKER_03]: I had an old school chiptune song all picked out, but we'll see.

521
00:34:47,491 --> 00:34:47,711
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see.

522
00:34:48,151 --> 00:34:49,872
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyhow, we're going to move on with more news.

523
00:34:51,192 --> 00:34:51,972
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, Australia.

524
00:34:52,773 --> 00:34:56,474
[SPEAKER_03]: You should write your legislators and tell them they're crap.

525
00:34:58,320 --> 00:34:58,580
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura.com

526
00:35:16,684 --> 00:35:17,565
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

527
00:35:36,511 --> 00:35:48,228
[SPEAKER_10]: So there's a rumor that by the end of the year actually, or I guess near future, you're going to be able to play your PSP minis on your PlayStation 3.

528
00:35:50,071 --> 00:35:51,613
[SPEAKER_10]: So there's basically kind of...

529
00:35:53,177 --> 00:35:54,358
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know, you can look at it two ways.

530
00:35:54,519 --> 00:36:03,809
[SPEAKER_10]: One, they're allowing you more customers, I guess, to purchase these PSP minis, which is neat that they would allow you to be able to play it.

531
00:36:03,889 --> 00:36:09,575
[SPEAKER_10]: Two, they don't have very much confidence in the PlayStation portable platform in order to...

532
00:36:12,136 --> 00:36:14,958
[SPEAKER_10]: PSP Minis are not up to expectations right now.

533
00:36:38,423 --> 00:36:46,088
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, maybe because the PlayStation Portable, I mean, the PSP Go's, I mean, obviously are all digital.

534
00:36:46,548 --> 00:37:00,157
[SPEAKER_10]: Most people with PSPs probably aren't really interested in download games, whereas, you know, they're more interested in kind of the retail stuff, because that way if they don't like it, they can send it back, or they can rent it, or they can try it out, and that kind of stuff.

535
00:37:00,917 --> 00:37:04,760
[SPEAKER_10]: And maybe just some of these games, like, you know,

536
00:37:07,124 --> 00:37:08,426
[SPEAKER_10]: Tetris they put out there.

537
00:37:08,466 --> 00:37:11,149
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, who hasn't played Tetris and really do it?

538
00:37:12,029 --> 00:37:13,371
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's one reason why the PSP minis.

539
00:37:13,391 --> 00:37:15,533
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's my proof on why the PSP minis is doing well.

540
00:37:15,553 --> 00:37:17,395
[SPEAKER_03]: And here's a game you can play along with at home.

541
00:37:17,435 --> 00:37:17,775
[SPEAKER_03]: You ready?

542
00:37:18,276 --> 00:37:18,536
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

543
00:37:19,157 --> 00:37:19,417
[SPEAKER_03]: Quick.

544
00:37:19,797 --> 00:37:23,201
[SPEAKER_03]: Name one PSP minigame that's been released that wasn't Sudoku or Tetris.

545
00:37:23,241 --> 00:37:23,421
[SPEAKER_03]: Ready?

546
00:37:23,501 --> 00:37:23,701
[SPEAKER_03]: Go.

547
00:37:25,003 --> 00:37:26,584
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

548
00:37:26,604 --> 00:37:28,346
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, that's why they're not doing well.

549
00:37:28,366 --> 00:37:29,888
[SPEAKER_03]: Because there's nothing of note.

550
00:37:32,481 --> 00:37:33,723
[SPEAKER_10]: XNA Lacrosse Game PSP Minis

551
00:37:47,338 --> 00:37:53,965
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got to mention this that's come up in our chat because it's not on the show roll tonight but it's something I have to bring up because I really want to hear what Loki has to say to this.

552
00:37:54,446 --> 00:38:02,154
[SPEAKER_03]: Salacious Poppin Chat says there was some sort of Logitech rumor this week about them considering making a UMD add-on for the Go.

553
00:38:03,176 --> 00:38:04,257
[SPEAKER_10]: And they already denied it.

554
00:38:04,710 --> 00:38:05,330
[SPEAKER_03]: Have they denied it?

555
00:38:05,490 --> 00:38:05,970
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

556
00:38:07,311 --> 00:38:08,011
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's imagine.

557
00:38:08,051 --> 00:38:15,934
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's go to the land of make-believe with King Friday and everybody for a minute and imagine that this rumor were true.

558
00:38:16,334 --> 00:38:17,154
[SPEAKER_03]: What would you be saying?

559
00:38:17,834 --> 00:38:20,275
[SPEAKER_10]: That's the most retarded thing I've ever heard.

560
00:38:20,735 --> 00:38:29,521
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, let me buy a more expensive system that's like almost $100 more expensive than the actual normal system, which includes this peripheral.

561
00:38:29,781 --> 00:38:35,985
[SPEAKER_10]: And then buy an additional peripheral to be able to have the same features as the cheaper system.

562
00:38:36,326 --> 00:38:43,130
[SPEAKER_10]: So you're asking me to spend more money for the system initially and more money on top of that to buy a feature that should have been there in the first place.

563
00:38:43,710 --> 00:38:44,691
[SPEAKER_10]: Sure, sign me up.

564
00:38:46,292 --> 00:38:48,654
[SPEAKER_07]: My reply to that would be, but meow meow this.

565
00:38:52,376 --> 00:38:53,337
[SPEAKER_03]: I see what you did there.

566
00:38:53,797 --> 00:38:54,257
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, you did.

567
00:38:54,517 --> 00:38:57,639
[SPEAKER_07]: And like half of our listeners aren't even going to get it because they didn't watch Mr. Rogers Neighborhood.

568
00:38:57,659 --> 00:39:01,621
[SPEAKER_03]: No, plenty more are not going to understand what you just did, but I laughed very hard.

569
00:39:02,302 --> 00:39:03,282
[SPEAKER_07]: Rob, that was for your benefit.

570
00:39:03,302 --> 00:39:03,622
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

571
00:39:03,682 --> 00:39:04,223
[SPEAKER_03]: I appreciate it.

572
00:39:04,243 --> 00:39:06,484
[SPEAKER_07]: And Rob, I think that's so meow meow stupid.

573
00:39:06,604 --> 00:39:09,646
[SPEAKER_03]: I think this show should simply exist to amuse me.

574
00:39:09,766 --> 00:39:11,047
[SPEAKER_03]: Otherwise, what the hell are we doing?

575
00:39:11,087 --> 00:39:12,727
[SPEAKER_03]: We're just wasting our goddamn time.

576
00:39:13,168 --> 00:39:14,989
[SPEAKER_07]: We do this show every week so you can bring me coffee.

577
00:39:15,669 --> 00:39:25,856
[SPEAKER_10]: I was hoping that Logitech rumor was true, because it would just be the nice bullet point to the failure of the PSP Go.

578
00:39:25,896 --> 00:39:29,858
[SPEAKER_10]: It's like, and there's the ribbon for the package of failure right there.

579
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:36,563
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's what they should call the add-on, Logitech package of failure for the PSP Go.

580
00:39:38,064 --> 00:39:42,587
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, you already spent the money already, so apparently you're going to buy extra crap for it as well.

581
00:39:44,178 --> 00:39:45,159
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't know how to respond to that.

582
00:39:45,179 --> 00:39:46,680
[SPEAKER_07]: What were you going to say?

583
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:15,679
[SPEAKER_10]: or you could just, I don't know give up on the UMD format as a format for movies since they've stopped making them anyways

584
00:40:16,494 --> 00:40:22,297
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know, I never really saw any reason to... Because I already have that on Laserdisc somewhere.

585
00:40:22,317 --> 00:40:22,878
[SPEAKER_10]: And you know what?

586
00:40:23,058 --> 00:40:25,139
[SPEAKER_10]: You know why the PSP minis suck?

587
00:40:25,519 --> 00:40:28,661
[SPEAKER_10]: It's because they've already had the PSP download games already.

588
00:40:29,041 --> 00:40:33,883
[SPEAKER_10]: There was absolutely no need to add PSP minis as another form of download games.

589
00:40:33,903 --> 00:40:36,965
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I like the idea of cheaper games, just so we don't have anything of note.

590
00:40:37,005 --> 00:40:37,886
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, to be fair...

591
00:40:38,817 --> 00:40:39,417
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

592
00:41:01,514 --> 00:41:02,535
[SPEAKER_03]: I got nothing.

593
00:41:02,655 --> 00:41:04,016
[SPEAKER_03]: There's just nothing very of note.

594
00:41:04,596 --> 00:41:07,578
[SPEAKER_03]: And I do feel bad for the Sony fans.

595
00:41:07,598 --> 00:41:08,158
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, no, I don't.

596
00:41:08,298 --> 00:41:12,701
[SPEAKER_03]: But we habitually bash the PSP Go on this show.

597
00:41:13,021 --> 00:41:17,023
[SPEAKER_03]: But honestly, Sony, it's just time to give the PSP Go an abortion.

598
00:41:17,564 --> 00:41:22,607
[SPEAKER_03]: I realize it's already out of the womb, but just stuff it in the face with a pillow and end the PSP Go.

599
00:41:23,227 --> 00:41:24,388
[SPEAKER_03]: Because the PSP is a great system.

600
00:41:24,728 --> 00:41:25,108
[SPEAKER_03]: Go back to the 3.

601
00:41:25,649 --> 00:41:25,929
[SPEAKER_03]: It's great.

602
00:41:26,289 --> 00:41:51,942
[SPEAKER_10]: PSP's great, it's all it's internet, mp3s, movies all right there, it's great just stop it with the go stop it and it wouldn't have been that hard to I mean seriously all they would have had to do is make a PSP 4000 or whatever and have internal storage built into it so okay look we've got an internal drive and all the same features that you liked before and that would have been just fine

603
00:41:52,695 --> 00:41:54,716
[SPEAKER_03]: Brad from PopCulture asked an interesting question in chat.

604
00:41:54,776 --> 00:41:59,078
[SPEAKER_03]: How is the add-on any different than a cart adapter for the GameCube or SNES?

605
00:41:59,358 --> 00:42:03,320
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, in both those cases, you were taking portable systems and putting them on your TV.

606
00:42:03,921 --> 00:42:05,882
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that was the point of those.

607
00:42:05,982 --> 00:42:14,286
[SPEAKER_03]: Whereas this Logitech adapter is taking something that they took away and putting it back because you realized it never should have been gone in the first place.

608
00:42:15,233 --> 00:42:40,625
[SPEAKER_03]: If that makes any sense, I don't know I think that's the difference to me To be fair, those other adapters on the GameCube were a little silly as well Although the Super Game Boy did let you tweak the colors Silly, superficial things that weren't there to begin with At least something But at least, I don't know It's sort of like the HD DVD add-on to the Xbox 360

609
00:42:43,165 --> 00:42:46,174
[SPEAKER_10]: Something that they could have put in at launch, but they didn't.

610
00:42:47,558 --> 00:42:49,403
[SPEAKER_10]: And no one's missing it now.

611
00:42:50,866 --> 00:42:51,266
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see.

612
00:42:51,366 --> 00:43:05,950
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, maybe, again, in a year's time, we'll be singing a different tune, but I still think the PSP Go by that time will be... I think if they literally put this out, first off, it would have been Sony putting this out, not Logitech, although I can see why they do Logitech, so that way they wouldn't look as bad.

613
00:43:06,371 --> 00:43:07,551
[SPEAKER_10]: It would still be bad enough.

614
00:43:08,271 --> 00:43:11,672
[SPEAKER_10]: And right there, it's just like, oh, look, you don't have confidence in your system.

615
00:43:11,972 --> 00:43:13,953
[SPEAKER_10]: And how the hell would they manage to hack that?

616
00:43:14,433 --> 00:43:18,454
[SPEAKER_10]: And let's just say, for argument's sake, they were able to, I don't know...

617
00:43:20,057 --> 00:43:24,678
[SPEAKER_10]: Make that device and have it connect to their memory card slot or something like that to read UMDs.

618
00:43:24,858 --> 00:43:30,560
[SPEAKER_10]: It would be hacked in seconds and it would be a big old backdoor to the whole PSP Go.

619
00:43:30,620 --> 00:43:34,381
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not going to end up pretty for them.

620
00:43:35,081 --> 00:43:36,241
[SPEAKER_10]: Which is why they need to do it.

621
00:43:36,401 --> 00:43:40,222
[SPEAKER_10]: So that people can hack the Go even easier.

622
00:43:42,110 --> 00:43:43,411
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura had a game of the week once.

623
00:44:05,447 --> 00:44:05,747
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura.com

624
00:44:21,460 --> 00:44:21,981
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

625
00:44:41,866 --> 00:44:42,806
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

626
00:45:02,176 --> 00:45:05,998
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know Jamie's probably all over that, assuming it doesn't suck.

627
00:45:06,558 --> 00:45:08,039
[SPEAKER_03]: Although it looks like it might be fun.

628
00:45:08,079 --> 00:45:09,299
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks like it's like four players.

629
00:45:09,880 --> 00:45:11,020
[SPEAKER_03]: That could be kind of chaotic.

630
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:14,022
[SPEAKER_03]: If four players are going at the grid all at once, that could be interesting.

631
00:45:14,322 --> 00:45:14,702
[SPEAKER_07]: That could be.

632
00:45:14,902 --> 00:45:17,163
[SPEAKER_03]: That's probably its big thing.

633
00:45:17,243 --> 00:45:20,224
[SPEAKER_03]: It probably has online, everybody kind of attacks it all at once.

634
00:45:21,065 --> 00:45:21,465
[SPEAKER_03]: Could be cool.

635
00:45:23,346 --> 00:45:26,927
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, how about something that we kind of already knew?

636
00:45:27,408 --> 00:45:27,568
[SPEAKER_08]: Hmm.

637
00:45:29,046 --> 00:45:37,633
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, so you know the rumor was going on for a long time that a lot of the music in Sonic 3 had been done by Michael Jackson?

638
00:45:39,034 --> 00:45:44,178
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, I've heard that rumor before because the credits music sounds like Stranger in Moscow, right?

639
00:45:44,278 --> 00:45:46,920
[SPEAKER_07]: And Casino Night from Scream, the same thing.

640
00:45:47,205 --> 00:45:47,685
[SPEAKER_03]: Ah, that's right.

641
00:45:47,946 --> 00:45:50,087
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, the little triplet part.

642
00:45:50,267 --> 00:45:50,807
[SPEAKER_07]: But anyway, yeah.

643
00:45:51,067 --> 00:45:54,870
[SPEAKER_07]: So it was confirmed that he did it, but he was not happy with it.

644
00:45:55,290 --> 00:45:58,032
[SPEAKER_07]: So he wanted himself uncredited and the music altered.

645
00:45:59,553 --> 00:46:02,915
[SPEAKER_07]: But he, of course, kept a lot of the same elements to use in his own music.

646
00:46:03,766 --> 00:46:10,075
[SPEAKER_03]: That's kind of a bummer for Sega, because imagine if they could have marketed that Sonic 3 had a Michael freaking Jackson soundtrack.

647
00:46:10,115 --> 00:46:12,138
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, that would have been huge for them.

648
00:46:12,158 --> 00:46:20,070
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's not like Sonic 3 was a little game anyway, but there'd be a lot of people that would have taken a huge interest in this game knowing that Michael Jackson had been involved.

649
00:46:21,386 --> 00:46:32,777
[SPEAKER_07]: There's also, I actually remember there being interviews ahead of time that they said that they were getting Michael Jackson's involvement for the musical direction on one of the games.

650
00:46:34,239 --> 00:46:37,081
[SPEAKER_07]: Because, I mean, that was in a magazine back when.

651
00:46:37,101 --> 00:46:37,582
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

652
00:46:39,366 --> 00:47:05,272
[SPEAKER_07]: but the whole point was that, and this is a quote from actually an interview with Michael Jackson's composer Brad Buxer saying that at the time, this is a quote, at the time game consoles did not allow optimal sound reproduction and Michael found it frustrating he did not want to be associated with a product that devalued his music so what about Moonwalker, huh?

653
00:47:08,490 --> 00:47:10,532
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, Moonwalker was kind of a rat in the arcades.

654
00:47:11,092 --> 00:47:11,953
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, at the time.

655
00:47:12,933 --> 00:47:15,776
[SPEAKER_03]: Now you look back and go, this is something better left in my memory.

656
00:47:16,056 --> 00:47:16,837
[SPEAKER_07]: It came out on Genesis?

657
00:47:17,237 --> 00:47:17,597
[SPEAKER_03]: That's true.

658
00:47:18,278 --> 00:47:21,060
[SPEAKER_07]: I thought it was a pretty good rendition of Smooth Criminal.

659
00:47:21,423 --> 00:47:23,144
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, Salacious Pop was thinking what I was thinking.

660
00:47:23,204 --> 00:47:25,425
[SPEAKER_03]: At least there's always Space Channel 5 with Space Michael.

661
00:47:25,645 --> 00:47:26,946
[SPEAKER_07]: Space Channel 5.

662
00:47:27,806 --> 00:47:28,847
[SPEAKER_03]: By the way, have you ever heard this?

663
00:47:28,907 --> 00:47:30,108
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think this is the right YouTube.

664
00:47:30,148 --> 00:47:32,209
[SPEAKER_03]: I came across this earlier this week when I was reading about the story.

665
00:47:32,509 --> 00:47:33,910
[SPEAKER_07]: I've actually got one that I can link you.

666
00:47:34,230 --> 00:47:34,510
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you?

667
00:47:34,730 --> 00:47:35,470
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

668
00:47:35,510 --> 00:47:40,853
[SPEAKER_03]: Have you heard this hybrid one that's actually the credits and Michael Jackson, Stranger in Moscow over each other?

669
00:47:41,113 --> 00:47:42,094
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll play a little clip of this here.

670
00:47:45,696 --> 00:47:46,376
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, I have heard that.

671
00:48:00,202 --> 00:48:05,583
[SPEAKER_03]: By the way, I do think the Sonic 3 credit music is some of the best video game music from that era.

672
00:48:06,044 --> 00:48:10,285
[SPEAKER_03]: So it is pretty neat to know that Michael Jackson indeed had something to do with that.

673
00:48:12,125 --> 00:48:14,806
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah, the Ice Cap Zone thing, huh?

674
00:48:14,846 --> 00:48:16,126
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to link it to you right now.

675
00:48:16,206 --> 00:48:21,768
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, let's try to get this played here and then we'll move on with another story.

676
00:48:22,628 --> 00:48:26,689
[SPEAKER_03]: In fact, while I load that up, maybe we'll start moving into release dates this week.

677
00:48:27,049 --> 00:48:29,410
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, why don't you start off with the US releases and then we'll come back to this.

678
00:48:30,482 --> 00:48:31,823
[SPEAKER_10]: This week's not a lot coming out.

679
00:48:33,183 --> 00:48:40,305
[SPEAKER_10]: Pretty much your big game is going to be The Saboteur, coming out on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and PC.

680
00:48:41,366 --> 00:48:52,549
[SPEAKER_10]: Also this week, though, we do have one, I guess, well, apparently now one of the last Akira Yamaoka Silent Hill games, Silent Hill Shattered Memories, coming out on the Wii this week.

681
00:48:54,270 --> 00:48:55,770
[SPEAKER_03]: I have to pick that up.

682
00:48:55,970 --> 00:48:57,071
[SPEAKER_03]: I really like that at E3.

683
00:48:57,091 --> 00:48:57,911
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope it doesn't disappoint.

684
00:48:58,396 --> 00:49:00,098
[SPEAKER_10]: No, it looks freaking awesome.

685
00:49:00,358 --> 00:49:03,101
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, well, Nintendogs looked awesome too.

686
00:49:03,141 --> 00:49:03,782
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all I'm saying.

687
00:49:04,002 --> 00:49:05,484
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, but Nintendogs was awesome.

688
00:49:05,524 --> 00:49:09,729
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just, unfortunately, we didn't get to play it longer than five minutes at E3.

689
00:49:09,749 --> 00:49:09,989
[SPEAKER_10]: So, you know...

690
00:49:12,796 --> 00:49:16,700
[SPEAKER_10]: We thought it was good for longer than five, but really it was only good for five.

691
00:49:17,661 --> 00:49:21,164
[SPEAKER_10]: Of course, this week, Legend of Zelda Spirit Tracks on the DS.

692
00:49:22,586 --> 00:49:27,371
[SPEAKER_10]: And then there's some small crap that's littering the rest of the week.

693
00:49:27,911 --> 00:49:36,259
[SPEAKER_10]: Rec Room for the Wii, Puzzler World for the DS, which is a puzzle minigame compilation.

694
00:49:37,640 --> 00:49:59,686
[SPEAKER_10]: James Cameron's Avatar The Game out on PSP because I believe it's delayed from the rest of them and and that's about it actually alright let me go back to those YouTubes real quick before I get into the Japanese releases let's see this is the Who Is It mixed with Ice Cap Zone music?

695
00:49:59,886 --> 00:50:05,568
[SPEAKER_03]: yeah oops I still have my wave muted live radio fail

696
00:50:17,335 --> 00:50:17,756
[SPEAKER_03]: Carameldansen

697
00:50:46,474 --> 00:50:47,294
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude, I like this.

698
00:50:47,394 --> 00:50:50,635
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of neat.

699
00:50:50,795 --> 00:50:53,916
[SPEAKER_03]: It's so cool now that that game just has so much added value.

700
00:50:53,956 --> 00:51:01,079
[SPEAKER_03]: Even though this is kind of one of those things everybody always suspected anyway, but I think a lot of people were like, did Michael Jackson rip off Sonic because it was one of his favorite?

701
00:51:01,619 --> 00:51:03,600
[SPEAKER_03]: But now it's like, no, he fucking wrote it.

702
00:51:03,620 --> 00:51:06,221
[SPEAKER_07]: He just took the stuff he already did.

703
00:51:06,421 --> 00:51:08,521
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's amazing.

704
00:51:08,601 --> 00:51:12,963
[SPEAKER_10]: A couple more things I was going to mention real quick for release dates, even though it's not next week, but...

705
00:51:13,843 --> 00:51:19,286
[SPEAKER_10]: There's a couple of the Konami Classic volumes that are coming out on Xbox 360 for $20 each.

706
00:51:19,667 --> 00:51:22,248
[SPEAKER_10]: And actually, there's a couple that are pretty good deals.

707
00:51:22,889 --> 00:51:26,171
[SPEAKER_10]: The first one is... Are these just like the live arcade games?

708
00:51:26,191 --> 00:51:27,131
[SPEAKER_02]: These are live arcade games.

709
00:51:27,151 --> 00:51:27,972
[SPEAKER_02]: Like what PopCap does.

710
00:51:28,212 --> 00:51:28,792
[SPEAKER_10]: That's pretty sweet.

711
00:51:29,072 --> 00:51:32,495
[SPEAKER_10]: They've got Castlevania Symphony of the Night, Frogger, and Super Contra.

712
00:51:32,755 --> 00:51:33,055
[SPEAKER_10]: That's for $20.

713
00:51:33,095 --> 00:51:37,738
[SPEAKER_10]: The other one that they have is Track and Field, Russian Attack, and Contra.

714
00:51:39,150 --> 00:51:57,137
[SPEAKER_03]: so Russian Attack by the way I bet is one of those arcade games you probably didn't play growing up at least I didn't but it was actually a lot of fun on Xbox Live Arcade for five bucks wasn't a bad deal anyhow so that's what they're available for now I'm not sure if they've dropped in price enough to where that's actually not a good deal anymore but three games for 20 bucks

715
00:51:57,717 --> 00:51:59,479
[SPEAKER_03]: Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 Samurai Spirits Zen Samurai Shodown

716
00:52:23,126 --> 00:52:26,088
[SPEAKER_03]: It's from SNK, so that is getting released on the 360 this week.

717
00:52:26,868 --> 00:52:28,929
[SPEAKER_03]: Some fighting game fans are going to be very happy about that.

718
00:52:29,549 --> 00:52:30,910
[SPEAKER_03]: I know that series has its fans.

719
00:52:31,910 --> 00:52:39,794
[SPEAKER_03]: Also on PlayStation 3, Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 is out over there as well, as well as X-Edge or Cross-Edge.

720
00:52:40,814 --> 00:52:46,417
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, next week is Final Fantasy XIII, and I know a lot of you over here in America are going to be importing that.

721
00:52:46,957 --> 00:52:48,197
[SPEAKER_03]: Tales of Graces Tales of Sinfonia Tales of Graces

722
00:53:14,628 --> 00:53:18,109
[SPEAKER_07]: Man, I remember playing Deshinden 3 on PlayStation.

723
00:53:18,670 --> 00:53:19,130
[SPEAKER_03]: There it is.

724
00:53:19,330 --> 00:53:20,730
[SPEAKER_03]: Now you get a version on the Nintendo Wii.

725
00:53:20,850 --> 00:53:22,991
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if it's a ported version of the game or what it is.

726
00:53:23,111 --> 00:53:24,532
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, no, it's a redo.

727
00:53:24,612 --> 00:53:27,013
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, I remember seeing the trailer for it.

728
00:53:27,173 --> 00:53:27,333
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah?

729
00:53:27,513 --> 00:53:29,934
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, and it looked just as crappy as all the other ones, which means I have to play it.

730
00:53:31,361 --> 00:53:57,421
[SPEAKER_03]: PlayStation 2 you know the releases are dying down over there in Japan just like they are over here but I do want to point out World Soccer winning 11 2010 is coming out in Japan for you soccer fans Nintendo DS Luminous Arc 3 comes out on the DS this week and lastly on the PSP Bleach Soul Carnival 2 makes its way out in Japan as well as yet another Naruto game Naruto Shippuden Narutomit Excel 3

[SPEAKER_03]: There you have it for Japanese releases.

733
00:54:04,053 --> 00:54:07,555
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, we've got just a few notable ones for the UK.

734
00:54:08,035 --> 00:54:16,841
[SPEAKER_07]: On the 10th, Pixel Junk Shooter on PlayStation 3 and then on the 11th we have Tekken 6 on PSP and The Legend of Zelda Spirit Tracks on DS.

735
00:54:18,642 --> 00:54:19,102
[SPEAKER_03]: Very cool.

736
00:54:20,623 --> 00:54:28,668
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, so back to some more gaming news then and then we're going to get into the Classic Game of the Week before too long here and of course our Part B in just a little while.

737
00:54:32,205 --> 00:54:32,945
[SPEAKER_10]: This is kind of cool.

738
00:54:33,445 --> 00:54:38,047
[SPEAKER_10]: You may remember we talked a little bit about this before.

739
00:54:39,327 --> 00:54:45,550
[SPEAKER_10]: Kind of the whole play, create, share games that they've got now on the PlayStation 3.

740
00:54:45,810 --> 00:54:48,491
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, the second one in the series is Mod Nation Racers.

741
00:54:49,271 --> 00:54:52,192
[SPEAKER_10]: And, of course, it's kind of like build your own Mario Kart type game.

742
00:54:53,243 --> 00:54:58,306
[SPEAKER_10]: But they are, just like they did with LittleBigPlanet, they're going to be having a beta.

743
00:54:58,706 --> 00:54:59,867
[SPEAKER_10]: And it actually starts this month.

744
00:55:00,567 --> 00:55:03,009
[SPEAKER_10]: And there's a few ways you could be in that beta.

745
00:55:03,629 --> 00:55:06,151
[SPEAKER_10]: One is, of course, if you bought... Blowing someone at Sony.

746
00:55:06,571 --> 00:55:07,431
[SPEAKER_03]: That's one way you can do it.

747
00:55:08,152 --> 00:55:08,592
[SPEAKER_10]: That might work.

748
00:55:09,353 --> 00:55:13,755
[SPEAKER_10]: One is if you bought the LittleBigPlanet Game of the Year Edition, which have a code that came inside the box.

749
00:55:14,916 --> 00:55:19,539
[SPEAKER_10]: And then, of course, you can also sign up online for a chance to participate as well.

750
00:55:20,612 --> 00:55:49,305
[SPEAKER_10]: and that of course can be done at us.playstation.com slash modnation slash online beta and you can go ahead and sign up there also you can be an existing subscriber to core or subscribe on or before December 15th to receive a voucher as well and you can check out the pretty awesome game which still no one has announced that it's going to be on PSP but it is going to be on PSP you heard it here first

751
00:55:51,092 --> 00:55:53,713
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it also doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure that out.

752
00:55:54,253 --> 00:55:55,013
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, to be fair.

753
00:55:55,734 --> 00:55:59,195
[SPEAKER_03]: But it would be nice to have that confirmed by Sony at some point.

754
00:56:00,015 --> 00:56:03,436
[SPEAKER_03]: But you know, someday they'll decide to say it and it'll be a big surprise, except not really.

755
00:56:03,796 --> 00:56:05,997
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'm actually very much looking forward to Mod Nation's Racer.

756
00:56:06,097 --> 00:56:13,099
[SPEAKER_03]: I think this does look like another game that's going to be like a must-have on the PS3, so I'm very excited to see that.

757
00:56:13,900 --> 00:56:14,300
[SPEAKER_03]: So we'll see.

758
00:56:15,404 --> 00:56:16,364
[SPEAKER_07]: I was just reading in chat.

759
00:56:16,985 --> 00:56:17,305
[SPEAKER_03]: What's that?

760
00:56:17,465 --> 00:56:22,386
[SPEAKER_07]: Bon006 said, I think the gay marriage bill was just passed here in New York.

761
00:56:22,967 --> 00:56:23,607
[SPEAKER_03]: On a Sunday night?

762
00:56:24,127 --> 00:56:30,009
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I... Well, checking the news.

763
00:56:30,249 --> 00:56:36,491
[SPEAKER_03]: There was one that failed a couple days ago in the New York Senate, I think it was.

764
00:56:37,391 --> 00:56:38,232
[SPEAKER_07]: Let us know if you find out.

765
00:56:38,352 --> 00:56:39,412
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I'd be curious too.

766
00:56:40,913 --> 00:56:41,933
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it'd be about time.

767
00:56:44,804 --> 00:56:45,625
[SPEAKER_03]: Live in the now, people.

768
00:56:46,085 --> 00:56:51,509
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, coming to the now, which I'm very excited about, Sunsoft!

769
00:56:52,310 --> 00:56:54,511
[SPEAKER_03]: Rise from your grave!

770
00:56:54,831 --> 00:56:56,392
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, that wasn't a Sunsoft game, but still.

771
00:56:57,073 --> 00:56:58,034
[SPEAKER_03]: You might remember Sunsoft.

772
00:56:58,054 --> 00:57:04,418
[SPEAKER_03]: They made some cool 8-bit games back in the day, one of which, of course, near and dear to all of our hearts, Fester's Quest.

773
00:57:05,139 --> 00:57:05,579
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I'm kidding.

774
00:57:05,619 --> 00:57:06,319
[SPEAKER_03]: Blaster Master.

775
00:57:06,520 --> 00:57:07,780
[SPEAKER_03]: Although Fester's Quest wasn't that bad.

776
00:57:08,061 --> 00:57:09,742
[SPEAKER_03]: But Blaster Master was made by Sunsoft.

777
00:57:10,002 --> 00:57:11,383
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it wasn't that bad.

778
00:57:11,543 --> 00:57:12,504
[SPEAKER_07]: For me to poop on...

779
00:57:14,059 --> 00:57:17,440
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, I got that game for Christmas, one Christmas, and I played it for like a week straight.

780
00:57:18,181 --> 00:57:20,041
[SPEAKER_03]: It wasn't terrible, except it was very strange.

781
00:57:20,101 --> 00:57:24,063
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, aliens land in the Addams Family back... forget it.

782
00:57:24,543 --> 00:57:25,283
[SPEAKER_03]: Blaster Master!

783
00:57:25,343 --> 00:57:26,184
[SPEAKER_03]: Fuck everything else!

784
00:57:26,244 --> 00:57:27,424
[SPEAKER_03]: You have Blaster Master!

785
00:57:27,704 --> 00:57:29,205
[SPEAKER_03]: Who cares what else Sunsoft did?

786
00:57:29,245 --> 00:57:30,425
[SPEAKER_03]: They did Blaster Master.

787
00:57:31,005 --> 00:57:37,468
[SPEAKER_03]: And sure enough, that is the first thing they are planning to release now on the NES Virtual Console is Blaster Master.

788
00:57:37,788 --> 00:57:46,713
[SPEAKER_03]: Unfortunately, it's not like a WiiWare souped-up version or anything like that, but the Wii Virtual Console release of Blaster Master, 500 Wii Points, apparently coming out this month.

789
00:57:47,836 --> 00:57:52,479
[SPEAKER_03]: By the way, the whole reason this is happening is because Sunsoft is actually resuming operations in North America.

790
00:57:52,759 --> 00:57:55,301
[SPEAKER_03]: They're having a little help from a company called Gaijin Works.

791
00:57:55,861 --> 00:57:58,943
[SPEAKER_03]: And Gaijin Works made Miami Law for the Nintendo DS.

792
00:57:59,263 --> 00:58:01,365
[SPEAKER_03]: It was part of Working Designs.

793
00:58:02,245 --> 00:58:05,247
[SPEAKER_03]: Victor Ireland left them and kind of made this and so forth.

794
00:58:05,287 --> 00:58:08,349
[SPEAKER_03]: When Working Designs closed, da-da-da-da-da, one thing led to another.

795
00:58:08,710 --> 00:58:10,391
[SPEAKER_03]: So now we have Sunsoft.

796
00:58:11,391 --> 00:58:13,112
[SPEAKER_03]: Quote coming from Ireland...

797
00:58:14,233 --> 00:58:15,454
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you say Victor Ireland?

798
00:58:15,554 --> 00:58:17,816
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, from Working Designs We have his Twilight Zone

799
00:58:43,012 --> 00:58:43,333
[SPEAKER_03]: Really?

800
00:58:43,573 --> 00:58:43,814
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

801
00:58:44,114 --> 00:58:46,941
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, he's the guy you can thank for bringing Sunsoft back to life.

802
00:58:47,101 --> 00:58:47,542
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

803
00:58:47,903 --> 00:58:49,226
[SPEAKER_07]: And thank you for your pinball table.

804
00:58:49,467 --> 00:58:50,890
[SPEAKER_03]: Wait, do you have his contact information then?

805
00:58:51,531 --> 00:58:52,093
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, Dan might.

806
00:58:58,728 --> 00:59:05,571
[SPEAKER_07]: Dan actually bought his Twilight Zone and so he gave us you know that Goemon doll that I have?

807
00:59:06,271 --> 00:59:12,814
[SPEAKER_07]: He gave us a Goemon doll because they had a whole bunch of them because they were supposed to be for pre-ordering the Goemon game that they never brought out.

808
00:59:13,424 --> 00:59:17,127
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see, here's some of the other big things that Sunsoft did.

809
00:59:17,267 --> 00:59:18,228
[SPEAKER_03]: Arrow the Acrobat.

810
00:59:19,189 --> 00:59:21,191
[SPEAKER_03]: They did the Blaster Master series, of course.

811
00:59:21,231 --> 00:59:25,034
[SPEAKER_03]: They did some of the Batman games, like the original Batman on the NES, which was not too bad.

812
00:59:26,115 --> 00:59:28,838
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see, they did Fester's Quest, of course.

813
00:59:29,938 --> 00:59:36,104
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of the Final Fantasy Legend, I guess, games were translated by them, or localized, or whatever you want to say, by them.

814
00:59:37,485 --> 00:59:39,167
[SPEAKER_03]: Freedom Force, lol.

815
00:59:40,467 --> 01:00:01,834
[SPEAKER_03]: Lemmings on the NES they did a lot of NES ports of games that were big on other systems like Fantasy Zone on the NES was Sunsoft you remember how they had like a version of that that was done by Sunsoft so hmm very interesting Spy Hunter on the NES was them as well as Super Spy Hunter hmm I'd be very curious to see what they have planned

816
01:00:03,382 --> 01:00:03,762
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see.

817
01:00:04,422 --> 01:00:14,007
[SPEAKER_03]: I would love for some type of sequel to Blaster Master because clearly that's their huge, huge franchise and something better than the one that was on Genesis because the one that was on Genesis, not so great.

818
01:00:15,307 --> 01:00:21,830
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyhow, speaking of stuff worthy of the virtual console, we're going to take a trip down memory lane in a segment we like to call the Classic Game of the Week.

819
01:00:24,127 --> 01:00:32,915
[SPEAKER_03]: and every week in the Classic Video Game of the Week segment, DarkSakura takes a trip to the video game vault and pulls out a game that she thinks, damn it, you ought to be playing this game.

820
01:00:32,975 --> 01:00:43,165
[SPEAKER_03]: You young whippersnappers need to dust off your NES or SNES or, as in the case of a lot of these games, Sega-related systems and play this game.

821
01:00:44,106 --> 01:00:45,768
[SPEAKER_03]: So, DarkSakura, what is the Classic Game of the Week?

822
01:00:46,188 --> 01:00:46,728
[SPEAKER_07]: Final Fight.

823
01:00:47,749 --> 01:00:49,251
[SPEAKER_03]: Ah, a topically inspired game, I see.

824
01:00:50,086 --> 01:00:52,669
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep, I got inspired by last week.

825
01:00:52,809 --> 01:00:55,872
[SPEAKER_07]: Although, actually, it was also when I went and picked up my box of Final Fight Guy.

826
01:00:55,892 --> 01:00:57,333
[SPEAKER_07]: I was like, oh yeah, I should do this.

827
01:00:58,274 --> 01:00:59,335
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I found the box.

828
01:00:59,675 --> 01:01:00,796
[SPEAKER_07]: Hold on for a second, play some music.

829
01:01:01,037 --> 01:01:01,577
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, sure.

830
01:01:05,601 --> 01:01:12,368
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the final boss fight in Final Fight Guy, which really would be the same as the regular Final Fight 2, but fighting Belger.

831
01:01:18,124 --> 01:01:20,585
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry, I had to get the box because we're going to take a picture of it.

832
01:01:21,125 --> 01:01:21,505
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.

833
01:01:22,466 --> 01:01:24,646
[SPEAKER_03]: You'll have to put that on the picture site.

834
01:01:24,726 --> 01:01:25,026
[SPEAKER_03]: I will.

835
01:01:25,066 --> 01:01:28,247
[SPEAKER_03]: Blockbuster exclusive, direct from Japan, Final Fantasy Guy.

836
01:01:28,848 --> 01:01:29,508
[SPEAKER_07]: Final Fight Guy.

837
01:01:29,548 --> 01:01:31,729
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry, Final Fight Guy.

838
01:01:31,809 --> 01:01:33,389
[SPEAKER_03]: I wish I didn't say Fatal Fury Guy.

839
01:01:33,449 --> 01:01:34,390
[SPEAKER_03]: I've done that before, too.

840
01:01:34,410 --> 01:01:39,831
[SPEAKER_07]: This one I had my whole little obsession with getting everything Final Fight until they put out a Final Fight that sucked.

841
01:01:40,292 --> 01:01:43,913
[SPEAKER_07]: But I've got Final Fight CD and Mighty Final Fight, which was the SD version.

842
01:01:44,844 --> 01:01:45,785
[SPEAKER_07]: That came out on Nintendo.

843
01:01:45,805 --> 01:01:47,186
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, let me actually get back to the game.

844
01:01:47,527 --> 01:01:49,609
[SPEAKER_07]: Final Fight was an arcade game put out by Capcom.

845
01:01:50,569 --> 01:01:55,874
[SPEAKER_07]: And it was designed by Nishitani Akira, who you will see as Nin Nin.

846
01:01:56,795 --> 01:02:00,739
[SPEAKER_07]: And characters were designed by Yasuda Akira, which you'll see as Akiman.

847
01:02:01,520 --> 01:02:03,442
[SPEAKER_07]: So some of those names should definitely be familiar.

848
01:02:04,403 --> 01:02:05,844
[SPEAKER_07]: All this Capcom-tastic music.

849
01:02:06,682 --> 01:02:08,144
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

850
01:02:22,355 --> 01:02:23,276
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

851
01:02:39,504 --> 01:02:43,165
[SPEAKER_07]: He's super fast and was super awesome to play with, so never mind.

852
01:02:44,245 --> 01:02:46,366
[SPEAKER_07]: Cody was the balanced guy, Hagar was the strong guy.

853
01:02:47,167 --> 01:02:50,928
[SPEAKER_07]: He's also ranked third in EGM's list of top ten video game politicians.

854
01:02:51,868 --> 01:02:54,229
[SPEAKER_07]: So there were... Hello, Random.

855
01:02:55,690 --> 01:03:03,233
[SPEAKER_07]: So this game is actually way ahead of its time, because it actually had pre-op transgendered women in it.

856
01:03:06,092 --> 01:03:06,692
[SPEAKER_06]: Whatever.

857
01:03:06,952 --> 01:03:18,276
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, yeah, there are actually two women in the game called Poison and Roxy, but they turned them into men named Billy and Sid for the American version.

858
01:03:19,016 --> 01:03:21,417
[SPEAKER_03]: So they were... So you're not hitting women.

859
01:03:22,198 --> 01:03:22,618
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess.

860
01:03:23,238 --> 01:03:27,159
[SPEAKER_07]: Or hoochie women with really short skirts and, you know, where you can see under boobs.

861
01:03:27,859 --> 01:03:28,160
[SPEAKER_03]: I see.

862
01:03:29,760 --> 01:03:30,680
[SPEAKER_07]: Under boobs.

863
01:03:30,821 --> 01:03:31,221
[SPEAKER_03]: Under boobs.

864
01:03:33,766 --> 01:03:34,406
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what I mean.

865
01:03:34,486 --> 01:03:36,167
[SPEAKER_03]: I know what you're talking about.

866
01:03:36,368 --> 01:03:39,109
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't heard it phrased quite so eloquently before.

867
01:03:39,329 --> 01:03:42,931
[SPEAKER_07]: There was also the Andore family that were all based off of Andre the Giant.

868
01:03:44,352 --> 01:03:45,333
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

869
01:03:45,473 --> 01:03:52,737
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, a character named 2P that was based off of Player 2 character from Forgotten Worlds.

870
01:03:52,917 --> 01:03:53,718
[SPEAKER_07]: Did you ever play that game, Rob?

871
01:03:55,174 --> 01:03:56,394
[SPEAKER_07]: I have like the special controller.

872
01:03:56,414 --> 01:03:58,495
[SPEAKER_07]: It was one of Capcom's kind of interesting weird games.

873
01:03:59,355 --> 01:04:02,496
[SPEAKER_07]: But since he looked like the second player, he was called 2P.

874
01:04:03,436 --> 01:04:05,136
[SPEAKER_07]: So anyway.

875
01:04:05,396 --> 01:04:06,637
[SPEAKER_07]: And then you had your bosses.

876
01:04:06,797 --> 01:04:08,817
[SPEAKER_07]: You had Damned, who in the U.S.

877
01:04:08,877 --> 01:04:09,577
[SPEAKER_07]: was Thrasher.

878
01:04:11,498 --> 01:04:15,918
[SPEAKER_07]: You had Sodom, who was called Katana in the U.S.

879
01:04:15,938 --> 01:04:16,218
[SPEAKER_07]: version.

880
01:04:16,719 --> 01:04:20,819
[SPEAKER_07]: But he came out and he was one of the ones that was brought back for Street Fighter Alpha series.

881
01:04:22,480 --> 01:04:23,600
[SPEAKER_07]: In fact, that's the other video version.

882
01:04:24,051 --> 01:04:25,632
[SPEAKER_07]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

883
01:04:50,626 --> 01:04:51,647
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

884
01:05:17,570 --> 01:05:28,597
[SPEAKER_07]: He's like the uber crazy violent otaku guy who's so obsessed with Japanese culture that he wears a samurai hat and football padding.

885
01:05:29,357 --> 01:05:30,058
[SPEAKER_07]: It's stupid.

886
01:05:31,397 --> 01:05:43,405
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, um, but they said that the, um, the, uh, basis for, uh, Final Fight is actually off Double Dragon 2, The Revenge and the Arcade.

887
01:05:43,525 --> 01:05:51,070
[SPEAKER_07]: So, uh, they, uh, brought it up and they, um, actually were saying that, uh, some of the characters were former Street Fighters.

888
01:05:51,390 --> 01:05:52,191
[SPEAKER_07]: So, it's kind of neat.

889
01:05:52,811 --> 01:05:54,352
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, so yeah, there was the whole issue with the ports.

890
01:05:54,392 --> 01:05:59,336
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm actually gonna, um, take a link off of the, uh, uh,

891
01:06:02,599 --> 01:06:13,049
[SPEAKER_07]: You can actually see pictures up, and I'm going to link them in the chat room, of the changes to the characters, to the Poison character.

892
01:06:14,130 --> 01:06:19,895
[SPEAKER_07]: But now for other versions, there's Sega CD, the Sega CD version, which...

893
01:06:21,016 --> 01:06:23,238
[SPEAKER_07]: I have, I love Final Fight CD.

894
01:06:23,498 --> 01:06:27,381
[SPEAKER_07]: It's got an arranged soundtrack in a time attack mode.

895
01:06:27,461 --> 01:06:28,361
[SPEAKER_07]: It's super fun.

896
01:06:29,262 --> 01:06:32,144
[SPEAKER_07]: I've got Final Fight 1 somewhere for GBA.

897
01:06:33,525 --> 01:06:44,873
[SPEAKER_07]: There was, when it came out in the US, actually there was an Amiga Atari ST, Commodore 64 ZX Spectrum, well that was in Europe, and Armstead CPC version.

898
01:06:46,093 --> 01:06:49,095
[SPEAKER_07]: There was a Sharp X68000 version that came out.

899
01:06:50,376 --> 01:06:56,539
[SPEAKER_07]: There was the one I mentioned, Mighty Final Fight, which was the 8-bit version for NES that had the super deformed.

900
01:06:56,579 --> 01:06:58,080
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's actually super fun.

901
01:06:58,320 --> 01:06:59,720
[SPEAKER_07]: It is really fun and really cute.

902
01:07:00,621 --> 01:07:01,221
[SPEAKER_02]: Cheap and Final Fight.

903
01:07:01,661 --> 01:07:02,642
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

904
01:07:03,442 --> 01:07:08,205
[SPEAKER_07]: Final, well, no, super deformed because they are like the really squished up looking bodies.

905
01:07:08,345 --> 01:07:08,945
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I've seen it.

906
01:07:09,445 --> 01:07:09,706
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

907
01:07:10,806 --> 01:07:32,319
[SPEAKER_07]: also Final Fight came out on the Capcom Classics Collection Volume 1 for PlayStation 2 and Xbox and a portable version Capcom Classics Collection Remix for PSP and it had the emulated CPS music so that was pretty cool there was also Final Fight Streetwise which I pretend not to exist because it sucks um

908
01:07:36,412 --> 01:07:38,153
[SPEAKER_07]: or maybe it was the Final Fight Double Imp.

909
01:07:38,853 --> 01:07:38,993
[SPEAKER_07]: Nope.

910
01:07:39,493 --> 01:07:41,474
[SPEAKER_07]: It was the new one that they tried to do.

911
01:07:41,494 --> 01:07:42,474
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, whatever.

912
01:07:43,934 --> 01:07:46,735
[SPEAKER_03]: Damn, I only knew the Final Fight that was at the local pizza place.

913
01:07:47,235 --> 01:07:48,176
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, there's also sequels.

914
01:07:48,216 --> 01:07:49,816
[SPEAKER_07]: There was Final Fight 2 and Final Fight 3.

915
01:07:49,856 --> 01:07:50,396
[SPEAKER_07]: I've got those.

916
01:07:50,416 --> 01:07:51,276
[SPEAKER_07]: They're actually fun.

917
01:07:53,137 --> 01:07:55,738
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, there's also...

918
01:07:58,977 --> 01:08:04,805
[SPEAKER_07]: An American Street Fighter animated series, and I know it sucks, but they actually had Cody and Guy teaming up with Ken and Ryu.

919
01:08:05,566 --> 01:08:06,187
[SPEAKER_07]: It was really weird.

920
01:08:08,810 --> 01:08:15,720
[SPEAKER_07]: They're also, of course, Mike Hagar's and Saturday Night Slam Masters, and Muscle Bomber Duo and Slam Masters 2, The Ring of Destruction.

921
01:08:17,341 --> 01:08:45,454
[SPEAKER_07]: Street Fighter games you had Guy in Sodom then Rolento and Cody in Street Fighter Alpha 3 and then you had in Street Fighter 3 Second Impact you had a character that was modeled after Andori and his manager is Poison I don't know if you ever played Street Fighter 3 just a couple times that was kind of during that phase where I was out of touch with gaming for a little bit but Cody and Guy are actually going to be in Super Street Fighter 4 yeah and I remember that was a story last week that kind of probably got you thinking about this I think that's pretty cool

922
01:08:46,846 --> 01:08:50,907
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, there was also another 3D fighting game version, Final Fight Revenge.

923
01:08:52,607 --> 01:08:56,088
[SPEAKER_07]: And then, you know, meh.

924
01:08:56,528 --> 01:09:14,811
[SPEAKER_07]: But also, it sort of seems that they used the same format, though, for a lot of the other games that came out afterwards, like King of Dragons and Knights of the Round, Captain Commando, Warriors of Fate, Cadillacs and Dinosaurs, The Punisher, D&D Tower of Doom, and then Alien vs. Predator, though, I think is one of the best games to come after that.

925
01:09:17,642 --> 01:09:19,445
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, a lot of that came through.

926
01:09:19,525 --> 01:09:21,727
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah, Final Fight, win.

927
01:09:22,288 --> 01:09:22,568
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

928
01:09:23,029 --> 01:09:27,074
[SPEAKER_03]: There it is, your classic game of the week, Final Fight, available on lots and lots of systems.

929
01:09:27,194 --> 01:09:27,935
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll post those pictures.

930
01:09:28,115 --> 01:09:30,138
[SPEAKER_03]: The arcade was one of the most memorable.

931
01:09:30,936 --> 01:09:41,560
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, that's going to do it for Part A here of Orange Launch Radio, but don't go anywhere because we've got plenty more to come in Part B, including your Twitter topics, which I haven't put a call out for on Twitter yet, but we'll get those.

932
01:09:42,680 --> 01:09:44,301
[SPEAKER_03]: And I haven't seen any emails this week.

933
01:09:44,321 --> 01:09:46,421
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't even know if we'll have any of those, but we'll get to those.

934
01:09:46,742 --> 01:09:53,464
[SPEAKER_03]: But we do have some news, if nothing else, of talking about Redbox expanding to game rental, which I think has come up on the show before, but now it's going to the next step.

935
01:09:54,104 --> 01:09:55,845
[SPEAKER_03]: Somebody beat World of Warcraft.

936
01:09:56,345 --> 01:09:57,406
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, somebody beat it.

937
01:09:58,006 --> 01:10:00,828
[SPEAKER_03]: More things to waste money on your Xbox Live avatars with.

938
01:10:01,048 --> 01:10:04,690
[SPEAKER_03]: And, of course, it wouldn't be lulzy if we didn't talk about an adult game.

939
01:10:04,730 --> 01:10:06,391
[SPEAKER_03]: So we'll be talking about that all in the next segment.

940
01:10:06,671 --> 01:10:07,271
[SPEAKER_03]: So stay tuned.

941
01:10:07,291 --> 01:10:09,873
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll be right back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

942
01:10:16,434 --> 01:10:42,122
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello everybody and welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio on this lovely Sunday evening, December the 6th of 2009, where we're eagerly anticipating snow tomorrow here in Sacramento, where Orange Lounge Radio is based, when we never, and this is a big deal, I realize some of you live in the East Coast and even in other countries where snow is probably no big deal, in fact you probably hate it, but we never see snow here, so even the fact that it's just going to even like sprinkle a little white tomorrow is going to be amazing, I'm excited.

943
01:10:42,822 --> 01:10:44,102
[SPEAKER_03]: Too bad it's not Christmas tomorrow.

944
01:10:44,122 --> 01:10:45,023
[SPEAKER_03]: That would make it even better.

945
01:10:45,283 --> 01:10:45,983
[SPEAKER_03]: But, oh well.

946
01:10:46,423 --> 01:10:47,443
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're all excited about that.

947
01:10:48,164 --> 01:10:52,785
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyhow, we've got plenty more news to get into tonight here on Orange Lounge Radio.

948
01:10:52,805 --> 01:11:05,329
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, we always tape live every Sunday night at All Games Radio at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern Time, right at the close of the Bobby Blackwolf Show, which is on one hour before we start at 5 or 8, depending on where you live.

949
01:11:05,769 --> 01:11:11,651
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to get into some rapid-fire news, and then we'll get into your Twitter topics in just a little bit.

950
01:11:12,091 --> 01:11:12,691
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

951
01:11:29,997 --> 01:11:30,518
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura.com

952
01:11:49,955 --> 01:12:02,330
[SPEAKER_10]: of course it's an option to unlock the nudity so if you really don't want to see naked women then you don't have to and once again if you do pick up the game used you will be able to get the download content it's going to cost you $3 or 240 Microsoft points

953
01:12:07,016 --> 01:12:17,262
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh, let's see, Dante's Inferno, the God of War-esque type game, will be coming to the PlayStation Network and Xbox Live Marketplace in the form of a demo.

954
01:12:17,743 --> 01:12:20,884
[SPEAKER_10]: Soon, the PlayStation Network will get it a few weeks early.

955
01:12:21,045 --> 01:12:24,327
[SPEAKER_10]: In fact, you'll be able to pick it up next week on Thursday, December 10th.

956
01:12:25,087 --> 01:12:28,409
[SPEAKER_10]: The Xbox Live Marketplace will be getting it on December 24th.

957
01:12:29,550 --> 01:12:34,553
[SPEAKER_10]: And, um, the game itself is not scheduled to come out until, I believe, like, February, so...

958
01:12:37,431 --> 01:12:40,113
[SPEAKER_10]: Santa Claus is coming to PlayStation Home!

959
01:13:03,339 --> 01:13:05,841
[SPEAKER_03]: When I ask for a BB gun, will he tell me you'll shoot your eye out?

960
01:13:06,721 --> 01:13:07,181
[SPEAKER_10]: Perhaps.

961
01:13:07,522 --> 01:13:08,322
[SPEAKER_10]: You know what's funny?

962
01:13:08,462 --> 01:13:10,804
[SPEAKER_10]: Is my character still dressed like Santa from last year.

963
01:13:12,505 --> 01:13:12,745
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.

964
01:13:13,405 --> 01:13:14,706
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's how it's going to stay.

965
01:13:14,806 --> 01:13:15,767
[SPEAKER_03]: Now you need to change it.

966
01:13:15,807 --> 01:13:20,229
[SPEAKER_03]: You need to change it to like a Halloween outfit or something now that it's Christmas.

967
01:13:20,650 --> 01:13:20,810
[SPEAKER_03]: Nope.

968
01:13:21,230 --> 01:13:22,351
[SPEAKER_03]: You can be like Jack Skellington.

969
01:13:24,158 --> 01:13:24,878
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks for watching!

970
01:13:45,404 --> 01:13:46,365
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

971
01:14:07,899 --> 01:14:09,020
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

972
01:14:35,086 --> 01:14:39,409
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I didn't think this game could be possibly ported anywhere else, but I was proven wrong.

973
01:14:39,469 --> 01:14:41,870
[SPEAKER_03]: Dragon's Lair is coming out for the iPhone.

974
01:14:41,890 --> 01:14:49,676
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right, the old school 1983 Laserdisc game, Dragon's Lair, that's been released on every single console.

975
01:14:50,476 --> 01:14:51,957
[SPEAKER_03]: Ever, it seems like anyway.

976
01:14:52,317 --> 01:14:55,559
[SPEAKER_03]: It is now coming to the iPhone, thanks to Electronic Arts, who is doing the port.

977
01:14:56,239 --> 01:14:57,700
[SPEAKER_03]: Not sure exactly how they're doing it.

978
01:14:57,740 --> 01:15:00,201
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks like you have little up, down, left, right arrows on the screen.

979
01:15:00,501 --> 01:15:01,982
[SPEAKER_10]: Right, except the corners of the screen.

980
01:15:02,002 --> 01:15:05,744
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly, a big button on the other side for the sword button there.

981
01:15:06,424 --> 01:15:12,027
[SPEAKER_03]: It is coming out for five bucks, I think, because that's what Space Ace is priced at.

982
01:15:12,047 --> 01:15:15,549
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't have a final price yet, but Space Ace is five bucks.

983
01:15:15,569 --> 01:15:17,530
[SPEAKER_10]: They also had Cobra Command as well, which is...

984
01:15:18,070 --> 01:15:18,651
[SPEAKER_10]: Very similar.

985
01:15:19,252 --> 01:15:23,436
[SPEAKER_06]: I might need to get Dragon's Lair, except you know what I just found while I was cleaning off my desk?

986
01:15:24,738 --> 01:15:26,079
[SPEAKER_10]: Dragon's Lair?

987
01:15:27,921 --> 01:15:28,962
[SPEAKER_06]: Dragon's Lair HD.

988
01:15:29,183 --> 01:15:31,906
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, the HD kind of different one they did a while ago.

989
01:15:31,966 --> 01:15:32,426
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I remember that.

990
01:15:32,446 --> 01:15:34,469
[SPEAKER_07]: Hidden under a layer of stuff.

991
01:15:34,729 --> 01:15:35,069
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.

992
01:15:35,710 --> 01:15:38,053
[SPEAKER_07]: I tell you, I sneeze and find games, Bob.

993
01:15:39,671 --> 01:15:41,172
[SPEAKER_07]: I still need to take a picture of Final Fight Guy, don't I?

994
01:15:41,812 --> 01:15:42,172
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, you do.

995
01:15:43,253 --> 01:15:44,754
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so, I don't know.

996
01:15:45,414 --> 01:15:48,836
[SPEAKER_03]: I will always be partial to the Dragon's Lair that was on the Commodore 64.

997
01:15:48,956 --> 01:15:50,076
[SPEAKER_03]: It was way different.

998
01:15:50,096 --> 01:15:51,417
[SPEAKER_03]: It was like a completely different game.

999
01:15:52,477 --> 01:15:55,099
[SPEAKER_03]: Harder than hell, but a lot of fun, I have to admit.

1000
01:15:55,839 --> 01:15:57,020
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the one I'll always be partial to.

1001
01:15:57,681 --> 01:15:59,843
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyhow, how about some news about Rock Band?

1002
01:15:59,883 --> 01:16:03,746
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, it wouldn't be a week here at OLR if we didn't have news about upcoming Rock Band releases.

1003
01:16:04,146 --> 01:16:06,088
[SPEAKER_03]: More Green Day coming out for Rock Band.

1004
01:16:06,368 --> 01:16:19,860
[SPEAKER_03]: Apparently, Christian's Inferno, Last of the American Girls, and Viva La Gloria, which I believe are all off the latest CD, 21st Century Breakdown, are on their way on December 15th or December 17th, depending on what system you're on.

1005
01:16:21,687 --> 01:16:22,868
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for watching!

1006
01:16:41,055 --> 01:16:43,399
[SPEAKER_03]: This is kind of awesome in a real dorky sort of way.

1007
01:16:43,799 --> 01:16:46,604
[SPEAKER_03]: Simon and Garfunkel are getting some songs in Rock Band.

1008
01:16:47,185 --> 01:16:53,294
[SPEAKER_03]: I am a rock and the sounds of silence because when you want to rock, I know the first thing you think of is Simon and Garfunkel.

1009
01:16:54,036 --> 01:16:55,258
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, what do you got for us tonight?

1010
01:16:56,774 --> 01:16:58,075
[SPEAKER_07]: Just a few things, actually.

1011
01:16:59,796 --> 01:17:03,437
[SPEAKER_07]: And it isn't actually the page I was looking at about the land of make-believe.

1012
01:17:05,118 --> 01:17:14,423
[SPEAKER_07]: Gearbox actually trademarked Border Worlds, so the rumor is that Borderlands could be extended into...

1013
01:17:15,350 --> 01:17:16,131
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for watching!

1014
01:17:34,349 --> 01:17:37,652
[SPEAKER_07]: And then the UK has a date for Metal Gear Solid Peace Walker.

1015
01:17:37,752 --> 01:17:40,274
[SPEAKER_07]: It will be the 28th of May.

1016
01:17:41,395 --> 01:17:46,139
[SPEAKER_07]: And, of course, that's going to be on PSP.

1017
01:17:47,119 --> 01:17:53,565
[SPEAKER_07]: And actually, in Japan, it's going to be coming out on March 18th.

1018
01:17:54,365 --> 01:17:55,726
[SPEAKER_07]: So, four-player co-op.

1019
01:17:56,047 --> 01:17:56,687
[SPEAKER_07]: It can be Snake.

1020
01:17:57,168 --> 01:17:57,448
[SPEAKER_07]: Woohoo!

1021
01:17:58,320 --> 01:17:59,321
[SPEAKER_07]: Snakeu!

1022
01:17:59,821 --> 01:18:06,986
[SPEAKER_07]: And then Squeenix put out a song, a song, a game, a song summoner for iPhone.

1023
01:18:07,786 --> 01:18:12,409
[SPEAKER_07]: It's actually called Song Summoner the Unsung Heroes for iPhone and iPod Touch.

1024
01:18:13,450 --> 01:18:18,714
[SPEAKER_07]: And that it's got touchscreen controls, of course, and characters in different scenarios.

1025
01:18:19,034 --> 01:18:24,558
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's supposed to be out, there's a demo for it out actually.

1026
01:18:24,758 --> 01:18:26,759
[SPEAKER_07]: And for UK customers it'll be £5.99.

1027
01:18:30,061 --> 01:18:56,743
[SPEAKER_03]: I've heard that Song Summoner is kind of anth though because it was out on the old school iPod you know well in other words the iPods a lot of people still have really they came out on those a while ago and I think it was kind of under the radar because the iPhones and iTouches already come out and a lot of those releases got missed but I'd like to see what they've actually managed to do with it yeah you never know they might have like kind of changed some things and done some upgrades too so it would be kind of cool to see what is going on

1028
01:18:57,703 --> 01:19:04,208
[SPEAKER_03]: What I'd like to see what's going on with right now is the Twitter topics, so let's open up ye olde Twitter and see what you guys have to say.

1029
01:19:04,428 --> 01:19:07,290
[SPEAKER_03]: Very fast tonight with the Twitter topics, by the way, I'm quite impressed.

1030
01:19:08,271 --> 01:19:12,574
[SPEAKER_03]: Seg starting us off tonight, of course, with another plug for Umlaut, because that's happening this week.

1031
01:19:13,274 --> 01:19:15,016
[SPEAKER_03]: Seg wants to know, are y'all going to Umlaut?

1032
01:19:15,776 --> 01:19:21,060
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going, for sure, but I think the fact that it's on a weeknight is kind of screwing with everyone else, because it is a couple hours away.

1033
01:19:22,821 --> 01:19:29,244
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm able to kind of swing it where I'm getting off work a little early so I can make it, but I might be the sole representation there.

1034
01:19:29,664 --> 01:19:32,205
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, but I'm going to have three times the fun.

1035
01:19:32,886 --> 01:19:33,986
[SPEAKER_03]: So, meh.

1036
01:19:34,586 --> 01:19:37,668
[SPEAKER_03]: Hope to see some of you listeners there that are local to San Francisco.

1037
01:19:38,568 --> 01:19:59,817
[SPEAKER_03]: Alex Carson says I'm going to make a PSP app for your show if that's okay with you guys actually we do have a PSP website olrpsp.com and you can download a PSP radio tuner there I forgot about that in the earlier part of the show because Loki hasn't updated it in a couple years so whereas you might have some broken graphics and things I think it still works right Loki I don't know have you checked that out in a while

1038
01:20:02,020 --> 01:20:03,361
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it still sort of works.

1039
01:20:20,865 --> 01:20:21,165
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura.com

1040
01:20:44,554 --> 01:20:45,054
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see.

1041
01:20:45,755 --> 01:20:52,721
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkTetsuya says, Arcade Heroes is picking the best arcade game of the past decade, 2000 to 2009.

1042
01:20:53,462 --> 01:20:53,862
[SPEAKER_03]: Thoughts?

1043
01:20:54,883 --> 01:21:01,549
[SPEAKER_03]: My thought is, I'm kind of sad because this was the decade that arcades kind of died and got replaced with Ticket Redemption Machines.

1044
01:21:01,609 --> 01:21:03,430
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't know if I have an easy answer.

1045
01:21:03,470 --> 01:21:08,875
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyone have an answer for what the best arcade game of the past 10 years would be?

1046
01:21:10,862 --> 01:21:38,842
[SPEAKER_03]: Strider 2 I mean obviously DDR was somewhat impactful for us I would say also maybe like what was it oh gosh oh I know Final Furlong Horsey Riding Game Horsey Humping Derby Owners Club I would say Derby Owners Club just because it's so fucking epic like when you see it it's the size of an arcade amazing

1047
01:21:40,976 --> 01:21:42,517
[SPEAKER_03]: Sky, I love you, let's repeal Prop 8 and get married

1048
01:22:04,315 --> 01:22:07,377
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think you might need to take me to dinner first before I agree to get married, just saying.

1049
01:22:09,038 --> 01:22:12,120
[SPEAKER_03]: Alex Carson wants to know, how many of you are phone freakers?

1050
01:22:13,500 --> 01:22:14,001
[SPEAKER_03]: What is that?

1051
01:22:14,701 --> 01:22:16,082
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like hacking your phone, right?

1052
01:22:16,102 --> 01:22:16,882
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I'm not.

1053
01:22:17,223 --> 01:22:25,668
[SPEAKER_03]: Back in the day, people used to modify those Captain Crunch whistles to be able to dial the phones when back then it was the rotary pulse dials.

1054
01:22:26,228 --> 01:22:28,409
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that this kind of stuff we're talking about?

1055
01:22:28,569 --> 01:22:29,610
[SPEAKER_03]: Old school hacking stuff?

1056
01:22:30,371 --> 01:22:32,592
[SPEAKER_03]: I find that stuff interesting, but I don't do it myself.

1057
01:22:34,517 --> 01:22:36,478
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1058
01:23:03,654 --> 01:23:26,702
[SPEAKER_03]: um let's see let's see it was Javier Altman on Twitter says OLR pick your topic the platypus is made out of other animal spare parts or the saboteur boobies DLC with love footy well we already talked about the saboteur boobies DLC so uh the platypus is made out of other animal spare parts uh isn't that like a hot dog actually you're talking about I think that the platypus is god going see

1059
01:23:29,829 --> 01:23:39,057
[SPEAKER_03]: Blue Swim says, what do you think of the Best Buy giving DSi buyers a free copy of Tony Hawk's Motion, a game which requires a GBA port to play?

1060
01:23:40,318 --> 01:23:43,540
[SPEAKER_03]: This is where if I had the Price is Right Losing Horn queued up, I'd play it right now.

1061
01:23:44,141 --> 01:23:46,503
[SPEAKER_03]: That's kind of humorous, actually, in a sick way.

1062
01:23:46,523 --> 01:23:47,243
[SPEAKER_03]: That's hilarious.

1063
01:23:47,303 --> 01:23:48,244
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a Best Buy movie.

1064
01:23:48,304 --> 01:23:52,968
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't hear about that at all, actually, so thank you for bringing that to my attention because it's pretty lulzy.

1065
01:23:54,895 --> 01:23:59,619
[SPEAKER_03]: Master of the Claw sent us a YouTube link to some people having fun jamming.

1066
01:24:00,260 --> 01:24:01,361
[SPEAKER_03]: Look at that, they're getting down.

1067
01:24:03,423 --> 01:24:05,304
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my god, they're dancing to Bird is the Word.

1068
01:24:05,324 --> 01:24:07,466
[SPEAKER_03]: It reminds me of that Family Guy episode.

1069
01:24:08,127 --> 01:24:10,409
[SPEAKER_03]: They're playing a game called Just Dance on the Wii.

1070
01:24:10,809 --> 01:24:11,490
[SPEAKER_03]: Bird is the Word.

1071
01:24:14,107 --> 01:24:14,787
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you hear?

1072
01:24:15,588 --> 01:24:17,549
[SPEAKER_03]: Bird is the word.

1073
01:24:18,209 --> 01:24:21,611
[SPEAKER_10]: The fact that that's in that game, that makes the game 100% good.

1074
01:24:21,691 --> 01:24:31,016
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, yeah, I heard of this game and it looked ridiculous, but now that I know that it's tongue-in-cheek ridiculous, I'm far more interested, so thank you for bringing it to my attention.

1075
01:24:32,357 --> 01:24:33,637
[SPEAKER_03]: That guy is just getting down.

1076
01:24:34,378 --> 01:24:34,938
[SPEAKER_03]: And that chick.

1077
01:24:36,739 --> 01:24:39,360
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think that chick would be getting down like this, though, if you weren't paying her to do it.

1078
01:24:39,380 --> 01:24:40,481
[SPEAKER_03]: She looks a little bit...

1079
01:24:42,017 --> 01:24:42,658
[SPEAKER_03]: LilBinimo.

1080
01:24:42,838 --> 01:24:43,598
[SPEAKER_03]: That's awesome.

1081
01:24:44,099 --> 01:24:45,800
[SPEAKER_03]: That game does kind of look like fun, actually.

1082
01:24:46,641 --> 01:24:46,981
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

1083
01:24:47,021 --> 01:24:48,102
[SPEAKER_03]: Just Dance on the Wii.

1084
01:24:48,323 --> 01:24:49,564
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm assuming that's out now?

1085
01:24:49,984 --> 01:24:50,304
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

1086
01:24:50,344 --> 01:24:51,145
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, that's out now.

1087
01:24:51,725 --> 01:24:52,326
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, Loki.

1088
01:24:52,486 --> 01:24:53,367
[SPEAKER_03]: Been out for a few weeks.

1089
01:24:53,427 --> 01:24:55,469
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, we might have to play that and YouTube it.

1090
01:24:55,489 --> 01:24:56,450
[SPEAKER_10]: No, we don't.

1091
01:24:57,270 --> 01:24:57,931
[SPEAKER_03]: No, we don't.

1092
01:24:59,175 --> 01:25:00,836
[SPEAKER_03]: But Loki, didn't you hear?

1093
01:25:01,416 --> 01:25:02,737
[SPEAKER_03]: Bird is the word

1094
01:25:28,754 --> 01:25:32,499
[SPEAKER_03]: That could be the game of the year right there if we didn't have President Cat this year.

1095
01:25:32,559 --> 01:25:35,164
[SPEAKER_03]: Speaking of President Cat, I gotta get this out here real quick.

1096
01:25:35,704 --> 01:25:36,385
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you know...

1097
01:25:37,708 --> 01:25:41,191
[SPEAKER_03]: There's still no word about President Cat getting a release over here in the US.

1098
01:25:41,351 --> 01:25:42,151
[SPEAKER_03]: Just so you know.

1099
01:25:42,352 --> 01:25:43,473
[SPEAKER_03]: There's still no word on that.

1100
01:25:43,773 --> 01:25:49,777
[SPEAKER_03]: But, do you know what game is coming out on WiiWare in a couple months?

1101
01:25:49,857 --> 01:25:50,478
[SPEAKER_03]: Muscle March.

1102
01:25:50,578 --> 01:25:51,979
[SPEAKER_03]: Muscle March is coming out.

1103
01:25:52,019 --> 01:25:53,460
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you know what Muscle March is?

1104
01:25:53,861 --> 01:25:57,864
[SPEAKER_03]: If you don't know what Muscle March is, you need to YouTube this game immediately.

1105
01:25:58,464 --> 01:26:05,129
[SPEAKER_03]: Because it's like... It's awesome, but it's like, imagine Cho Aniki meets...

1106
01:26:06,010 --> 01:26:14,255
[SPEAKER_03]: That game meets that game show where you have to twist your body to not fall through the wall or whatever meets crack.

1107
01:26:14,576 --> 01:26:16,317
[SPEAKER_03]: Pure adulterated crack.

1108
01:26:19,879 --> 01:26:22,741
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't believe that game is coming out and yet no word on President Cat.

1109
01:26:22,781 --> 01:26:23,281
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just saying.

1110
01:26:23,341 --> 01:26:26,243
[SPEAKER_03]: And all this bullshit about President Cat only sold 100 copies.

1111
01:26:26,623 --> 01:26:27,464
[SPEAKER_03]: Source, please.

1112
01:26:30,438 --> 01:26:33,120
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I know probably like a hundred people over here that imported it.

1113
01:26:33,160 --> 01:26:36,121
[SPEAKER_03]: Apparently it got a shout-out on the 1UP show this week.

1114
01:26:36,141 --> 01:26:36,902
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't listen to that show.

1115
01:26:36,922 --> 01:26:40,904
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, they discovered the game, and so therefore they're informing the internet of the game.

1116
01:26:40,944 --> 01:26:42,405
[SPEAKER_10]: Gee, I can't.

1117
01:26:42,485 --> 01:26:44,666
[SPEAKER_10]: And they're the first ones that ever discovered the game.

1118
01:26:44,686 --> 01:26:45,207
[SPEAKER_07]: Clearly, yes.

1119
01:26:45,267 --> 01:26:46,367
[SPEAKER_07]: How about they're full of shit?

1120
01:26:46,467 --> 01:26:47,008
[SPEAKER_07]: Everybody...

1121
01:26:47,888 --> 01:26:48,848
[SPEAKER_07]: Send letters.

1122
01:26:48,968 --> 01:26:50,989
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, to be fair, they didn't call it President Cat.

1123
01:26:51,229 --> 01:26:53,910
[SPEAKER_03]: If they had called it President Cat, I would say something.

1124
01:26:53,950 --> 01:26:54,990
[SPEAKER_07]: But we refer to it by name.

1125
01:26:55,310 --> 01:26:56,351
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I know.

1126
01:26:56,851 --> 01:26:57,571
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't matter.

1127
01:26:58,131 --> 01:26:59,272
[SPEAKER_07]: It matters to me.

1128
01:26:59,612 --> 01:27:01,272
[SPEAKER_07]: How dare they steal our thunder?

1129
01:27:01,392 --> 01:27:02,292
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't care.

1130
01:27:02,593 --> 01:27:02,853
[SPEAKER_03]: I care.

1131
01:27:02,873 --> 01:27:04,793
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm all about spreading the word about the game.

1132
01:27:04,833 --> 01:27:07,874
[SPEAKER_07]: And if it gets it out there, then whatever.

1133
01:27:08,674 --> 01:27:10,075
[SPEAKER_07]: That's why we don't get recognized, Rob.

1134
01:27:11,131 --> 01:27:11,952
[SPEAKER_07]: We need to pimp ourselves.

1135
01:27:12,293 --> 01:27:12,793
[SPEAKER_07]: You can't prove it.

1136
01:27:13,474 --> 01:27:14,135
[SPEAKER_07]: I've got the internet.

1137
01:27:14,415 --> 01:27:15,437
[SPEAKER_07]: I have the data post.

1138
01:27:16,518 --> 01:27:18,660
[SPEAKER_10]: It was also on Joystick.

1139
01:27:18,721 --> 01:27:23,026
[SPEAKER_07]: You've got Joystick and Destructoid backing us up, so nah.

1140
01:27:24,227 --> 01:27:25,348
[SPEAKER_03]: I just don't care enough.

1141
01:27:25,409 --> 01:27:25,809
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry.

1142
01:27:25,829 --> 01:27:26,450
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't care enough.

1143
01:27:28,089 --> 01:27:31,291
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want to become the president cat show, okay?

1144
01:27:31,451 --> 01:27:32,291
[SPEAKER_03]: It had its moment.

1145
01:27:32,491 --> 01:27:33,331
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm over it.

1146
01:27:33,351 --> 01:27:35,993
[SPEAKER_10]: I listened to a little bit of the podcast.

1147
01:27:36,013 --> 01:27:38,954
[SPEAKER_10]: They're like, yeah, we heard it sold like 80 copies.

1148
01:27:38,994 --> 01:27:43,016
[SPEAKER_10]: Because there's 81!

1149
01:27:44,677 --> 01:27:46,437
[SPEAKER_10]: They're firing on all cylinders over there.

1150
01:27:49,859 --> 01:27:50,359
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see.

1151
01:27:53,061 --> 01:27:53,541
[SPEAKER_03]: Where was I?

1152
01:27:54,604 --> 01:28:00,150
[SPEAKER_03]: Matt Ostrovsky tweeted us, by the way, one more tweet here that the OLR listeners will want to know.

1153
01:28:00,651 --> 01:28:05,676
[SPEAKER_03]: OLR Evolution second mix will be coming out December 24th for everyone.

1154
01:28:06,017 --> 01:28:11,202
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, that's cool, like a little Christmas present, or Hanukkah present, if you will, whatever it is you're into, or Kwanzaa, I don't care.

1155
01:28:11,443 --> 01:28:16,188
[SPEAKER_03]: Whatever you celebrate, Solstice, or, you know, what do Pastafarians celebrate on Christmas, I guess?

1156
01:28:17,028 --> 01:28:19,130
[SPEAKER_07]: They celebrate Nokimasu.

1157
01:28:19,430 --> 01:28:20,431
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess that's what it is.

1158
01:28:20,471 --> 01:28:21,031
[SPEAKER_03]: A pirate day.

1159
01:28:22,753 --> 01:28:26,335
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyhow, whatever it is you celebrate this winter, OLR Evolution's second mix is coming out.

1160
01:28:27,096 --> 01:28:29,618
[SPEAKER_03]: If you don't know what that is, it's like a DDR clone type thing.

1161
01:28:30,419 --> 01:28:35,443
[SPEAKER_03]: They take one of those DDR sims and they completely reskin it with OLR related songs.

1162
01:28:35,863 --> 01:28:40,106
[SPEAKER_03]: I think they even take clips of our voice and now we're like the announcers in the game.

1163
01:28:40,547 --> 01:28:41,748
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a lot of great fan work.

1164
01:28:42,048 --> 01:28:44,610
[SPEAKER_07]: I definitely need to check this

1165
01:28:44,730 --> 01:28:50,062
[SPEAKER_03]: I take it as a big compliment it's amazing so thank you very much fans for putting that together you guys rock

1166
01:28:50,267 --> 01:28:52,008
[SPEAKER_10]: That Just Dance game looks interesting.

1167
01:28:52,148 --> 01:28:53,629
[SPEAKER_03]: Doesn't Just Dance kind of look like fun?

1168
01:28:54,409 --> 01:28:55,650
[SPEAKER_10]: It's only because that song's in there.

1169
01:28:55,670 --> 01:28:57,391
[SPEAKER_10]: If there's any other song, I wouldn't give it to you.

1170
01:28:57,411 --> 01:29:05,736
[SPEAKER_03]: I will admit, to the tweeter who asked why the hell we hadn't talked about it before, when I saw the box art and the songs they were advertising, I was like, this is going to be Weech here or something.

1171
01:29:06,376 --> 01:29:10,819
[SPEAKER_03]: I did dismiss it very quickly, but it looks like it could be ridiculous fun.

1172
01:29:10,939 --> 01:29:18,423
[SPEAKER_10]: If it was called Just Dance featuring the bird, surfing bird, you know, 100,000 more copies sold right there.

1173
01:29:20,762 --> 01:29:21,364
[SPEAKER_03]: Gaming News and Loki.

1174
01:29:21,384 --> 01:29:21,484
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

1175
01:29:21,505 --> 01:29:21,545
[SPEAKER_03]: Um...

1176
01:29:27,741 --> 01:29:41,664
[SPEAKER_10]: Redbox, the DVD kiosk rental place that's been popularized by all its locations and Walmarts and various supermarkets and everywhere else in between.

1177
01:29:42,504 --> 01:29:43,805
[SPEAKER_10]: They are now test marketing.

1178
01:29:43,885 --> 01:29:52,026
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, they have been test marketing game rentals in Reno, Nevada and Wilmington, North Carolina.

1179
01:29:52,766 --> 01:29:54,067
[SPEAKER_10]: They're testing them out at $2 a piece.

1180
01:29:56,411 --> 01:29:57,814
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I've been well aware of this.

1181
01:29:58,135 --> 01:29:59,759
[SPEAKER_10]: It's something we deal with, actually.

1182
01:30:02,826 --> 01:30:06,033
[SPEAKER_10]: And hopefully it's something that will launch full scale at some point.

1183
01:30:06,530 --> 01:30:11,073
[SPEAKER_10]: They're also testing some higher price points too for DVD rentals, but that's another story.

1184
01:30:11,673 --> 01:30:16,576
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a whole thing because I hear the movie studios are pissed that they're only charging a dollar for DVD rentals.

1185
01:30:16,596 --> 01:30:19,998
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, but that's... Because it devalues the movie.

1186
01:30:20,699 --> 01:30:23,800
[SPEAKER_03]: As if ending up in the $5 bin at Walmart isn't devaluing your movie.

1187
01:30:23,840 --> 01:30:24,561
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, please get over yourself.

1188
01:30:24,601 --> 01:30:27,903
[SPEAKER_10]: I could talk for a long time about how retarded that

1189
01:30:28,383 --> 01:30:28,963
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks for watching!

1190
01:30:47,990 --> 01:30:48,671
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1191
01:31:09,162 --> 01:31:10,382
[SPEAKER_10]: and that's unfortunately the case.

1192
01:31:10,723 --> 01:31:13,263
[SPEAKER_10]: This actually, I believe, is unrelated to all that.

1193
01:31:13,383 --> 01:31:26,748
[SPEAKER_10]: The reason why I think they're raising their rentals to $2 is because they're starting to carry more Blu-rays in there and you can't rent a Blu-ray for a buck a day and expect to make a return on your investment.

1194
01:31:27,388 --> 01:31:30,209
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's true too, is that they're going to lose money at that rate.

1195
01:31:30,409 --> 01:31:32,989
[SPEAKER_10]: But still, I think it's kind of cool though, $2 rentals for games.

1196
01:31:33,029 --> 01:31:33,770
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, that's not bad.

1197
01:31:34,070 --> 01:31:34,670
[SPEAKER_03]: That's not bad at all.

1198
01:31:35,329 --> 01:31:40,616
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't either, but I should.

1199
01:31:41,016 --> 01:31:43,759
[SPEAKER_03]: I would save a lot of money if I were smart enough to rent the games.

1200
01:31:44,120 --> 01:31:48,485
[SPEAKER_03]: My only issue is that the nearest Redbox machine I can think of is at Walmart, and I ain't setting foot in that place.

1201
01:31:49,642 --> 01:31:50,283
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1202
01:32:14,229 --> 01:32:18,196
[SPEAKER_03]: Which is funny, Safeway is next door to Walmart, yet Safeway doesn't have that problem.

1203
01:32:19,339 --> 01:32:20,641
[SPEAKER_03]: Because Safeway hires security guards.

1204
01:32:21,984 --> 01:32:25,591
[SPEAKER_10]: Safeway probably also doesn't want people loitering out front selling shit too, so.

1205
01:32:27,234 --> 01:32:28,934
[SPEAKER_10]: I had people knock at my door today.

1206
01:32:29,034 --> 01:32:30,955
[SPEAKER_10]: Two different people trying to sell me shit.

1207
01:32:31,415 --> 01:32:32,255
[SPEAKER_10]: I hate that shit.

1208
01:32:33,235 --> 01:32:36,476
[SPEAKER_10]: Someone trying to sell me the SAC-B so they can get their $1,000 scholarship.

1209
01:32:36,696 --> 01:32:40,197
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you know how many of those kids have come to my door in the past couple weeks?

1210
01:32:40,217 --> 01:32:44,518
[SPEAKER_03]: Because when I was home sick with the swine flu, I swear to God, three of those people came by the house.

1211
01:32:45,338 --> 01:32:49,619
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, I'm going to cough on you, and then you're really going to have something to fundraise for.

1212
01:32:50,139 --> 01:32:51,519
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you have any cans?

1213
01:32:52,040 --> 01:32:53,040
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I don't have any cans.

1214
01:32:53,080 --> 01:32:53,520
[SPEAKER_10]: Go away.

1215
01:32:54,858 --> 01:32:57,799
[SPEAKER_03]: People dig through the recycle bin at my house.

1216
01:32:58,659 --> 01:33:00,700
[SPEAKER_03]: I gotta watch what I throw in there.

1217
01:33:02,520 --> 01:33:03,141
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of freaky.

1218
01:33:03,641 --> 01:33:04,121
[SPEAKER_10]: People suck.

1219
01:33:04,781 --> 01:33:09,363
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyhow, ToyGak in our chat says threaten to shoot them if they don't get off your property.

1220
01:33:09,403 --> 01:33:10,323
[SPEAKER_03]: Sadly, it's not that easy.

1221
01:33:11,581 --> 01:33:15,884
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkTattooia is pointing me to the peopleofwalmart.com website, which, by the way, love.

1222
01:33:16,725 --> 01:33:17,565
[SPEAKER_03]: Love that site.

1223
01:33:17,665 --> 01:33:17,886
[SPEAKER_03]: Hilarity.

1224
01:33:17,906 --> 01:33:18,786
[SPEAKER_10]: Great time waster.

1225
01:33:19,026 --> 01:33:19,927
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, great time waster.

1226
01:33:20,387 --> 01:33:22,689
[SPEAKER_03]: Hitstone wants to know, is Walmart that bad in California?

1227
01:33:22,969 --> 01:33:23,630
[SPEAKER_03]: Depends where you are.

1228
01:33:24,290 --> 01:33:25,411
[SPEAKER_03]: There's some really nice ones.

1229
01:33:25,451 --> 01:33:27,112
[SPEAKER_03]: There's some really nice Walmarts I will go to.

1230
01:33:27,132 --> 01:33:27,913
[SPEAKER_07]: I like to... Well...

1231
01:33:28,573 --> 01:33:32,618
[SPEAKER_07]: Walmart for me also, when I first moved out here, I could not find a Walmart.

1232
01:33:33,059 --> 01:33:35,282
[SPEAKER_07]: We had to go to like Alberta to find a Walmart.

1233
01:33:35,302 --> 01:33:37,324
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, they're only new as of the past 10 years.

1234
01:33:37,424 --> 01:33:38,786
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, now we have the super centers now.

1235
01:33:39,126 --> 01:33:41,069
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and honestly, that makes the difference to me.

1236
01:33:41,089 --> 01:33:42,831
[SPEAKER_03]: If it's a super center, it's usually really nice.

1237
01:33:42,871 --> 01:33:43,372
[SPEAKER_03]: If it's not...

1238
01:33:43,892 --> 01:34:11,685
[SPEAKER_07]: for the longest time we couldn't have them out here because of actually zoning laws regarding grocery stores where you can have a certain number of grocery stores within a certain radius of each other but I think they since lifted that because I saw them building the one on Antelope way back here near where I live when I would come home from work and now it's here and I love it actually it's kind of funny I just stayed in there for two hours when they first opened it because I was so homesick when I get homesick I go to Walmart

1239
01:34:12,381 --> 01:34:20,644
[SPEAKER_03]: Honestly, though, why would I ever go to Walmart when there's a Target just a couple blocks away that's brand spanking new and nice and even has groceries now?

1240
01:34:21,164 --> 01:34:23,745
[SPEAKER_03]: It's Uber Target, and I love it.

1241
01:34:24,286 --> 01:34:26,987
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, Walmart does have better prices for certain things.

1242
01:34:27,267 --> 01:34:31,028
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, I know you're not a chick, but... Tampons?

1243
01:34:31,648 --> 01:34:35,390
[SPEAKER_07]: No, actually, the hair dye that I buy, I actually get cheaper.

1244
01:34:35,850 --> 01:34:40,532
[SPEAKER_07]: A lot of the stuff that I get, actually, I tend to get a whole lot cheaper than action figures.

1245
01:34:40,832 --> 01:34:41,012
[SPEAKER_08]: Mm-hmm.

1246
01:34:44,192 --> 01:34:53,638
[SPEAKER_07]: Where else can I go to get a bag of baby spinach and then run over and buy some Equate brand NyQuil stuff?

1247
01:34:55,459 --> 01:34:57,460
[SPEAKER_03]: HitStun is mentioning Costco.

1248
01:34:57,480 --> 01:34:58,781
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, it was Marissa that first said it.

1249
01:34:58,861 --> 01:35:00,582
[SPEAKER_03]: Screw Sam's Club, Costco for the win.

1250
01:35:01,182 --> 01:35:04,124
[SPEAKER_03]: Costco's pretty awesome if you need like 15 of something.

1251
01:35:06,206 --> 01:35:06,747
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1252
01:35:15,342 --> 01:35:15,682
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what?

1253
01:35:15,702 --> 01:35:16,503
[SPEAKER_03]: It would be a smart arrangement.

1254
01:35:16,523 --> 01:35:17,064
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what we do?

1255
01:35:17,524 --> 01:35:28,314
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, we actually did just get a Costco membership, but we had a friend, actually our landlord, but he's a buddy of ours, has a Costco membership, and then Dan is our friend Julie's complimentary spouse.

1256
01:35:29,595 --> 01:35:29,855
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.

1257
01:35:30,856 --> 01:35:33,319
[SPEAKER_07]: I actually got pissed off over that the first time, though.

1258
01:35:33,659 --> 01:35:34,139
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, yeah.

1259
01:35:34,340 --> 01:35:36,261
[SPEAKER_07]: But I think we have our own membership now, but still.

1260
01:35:36,822 --> 01:35:38,043
[SPEAKER_03]: I like Costco quite a bit, actually.

1261
01:35:38,063 --> 01:35:38,363
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1262
01:35:39,504 --> 01:35:44,329
[SPEAKER_03]: All joking aside about the bulk items, they do have really good deals on TVs and the high-end stuff.

1263
01:35:44,929 --> 01:35:46,211
[SPEAKER_03]: I got my TV at Costco.

1264
01:35:47,111 --> 01:35:48,553
[SPEAKER_07]: I told you about what happened with ours, right?

1265
01:35:49,674 --> 01:35:54,618
[SPEAKER_07]: Keep in mind, with Costco, you can return anything, anytime, without your receipt.

1266
01:35:55,039 --> 01:35:56,020
[SPEAKER_07]: You can just go.

1267
01:35:56,260 --> 01:35:58,302
[SPEAKER_07]: It'll be on your membership card.

1268
01:35:58,382 --> 01:36:04,948
[SPEAKER_07]: We had our old 50-inch widescreen TV, and we actually took it back to exchange it for

1269
01:36:05,720 --> 01:36:07,464
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, something that was equivalent.

1270
01:36:07,844 --> 01:36:10,550
[SPEAKER_07]: And we actually now have a 52 inch LCD widescreen.

1271
01:36:12,165 --> 01:36:14,366
[SPEAKER_07]: Because we could exchange it for anything equivalent.

1272
01:36:15,086 --> 01:36:16,227
[SPEAKER_07]: And it was the only equivalent they had.

1273
01:36:16,267 --> 01:36:17,667
[SPEAKER_07]: Our old model is not made anymore.

1274
01:36:17,747 --> 01:36:21,108
[SPEAKER_03]: They do have a great return policy at Costco.

1275
01:36:21,929 --> 01:36:24,009
[SPEAKER_03]: I did have a TV break and I took it back and they took it back.

1276
01:36:24,650 --> 01:36:24,970
[SPEAKER_03]: Amazing.

1277
01:36:25,470 --> 01:36:27,771
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyhow, I don't know how we got from Redbox to Costco, but we did.

1278
01:36:27,811 --> 01:36:28,271
[SPEAKER_03]: So there you go.

1279
01:36:28,951 --> 01:36:29,912
[SPEAKER_03]: World of Warcraft.

1280
01:36:29,992 --> 01:36:32,473
[SPEAKER_03]: Moving on to this crack of a game.

1281
01:36:32,513 --> 01:36:33,273
[SPEAKER_03]: World of Warcraft.

1282
01:36:33,293 --> 01:36:34,033
[SPEAKER_03]: World of Warcrack.

1283
01:36:34,773 --> 01:36:35,274
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm addicted.

1284
01:36:35,374 --> 01:36:35,914
[SPEAKER_03]: What can I say?

1285
01:36:36,114 --> 01:36:36,514
[SPEAKER_03]: It's fun.

1286
01:36:36,834 --> 01:36:38,615
[SPEAKER_03]: But did you hear that it got beaten?

1287
01:36:38,855 --> 01:36:40,976
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, somebody beat the World of Warcraft.

1288
01:36:41,738 --> 01:36:43,099
[SPEAKER_03]: And of course, they live in Taiwan.

1289
01:36:44,240 --> 01:36:46,942
[SPEAKER_03]: And the character's name is Little Grey, if you translate the name.

1290
01:36:47,342 --> 01:36:48,763
[SPEAKER_03]: They've beat the World of Warcraft.

1291
01:36:49,263 --> 01:36:50,364
[SPEAKER_03]: What do I mean by beat?

1292
01:36:50,804 --> 01:36:54,627
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I don't mean they beat the final raid in the game, because then a lot of people have beat it, if that's the case.

1293
01:36:54,987 --> 01:37:00,331
[SPEAKER_03]: No, they have gotten every single achievement in World of Warcraft.

1294
01:37:00,511 --> 01:37:00,631
[SPEAKER_03]: All 986.

1295
01:37:00,671 --> 01:37:01,431
[SPEAKER_03]: Someone has no fucking life.

1296
01:37:04,548 --> 01:37:05,389
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's my thought.

1297
01:37:05,509 --> 01:37:07,311
[SPEAKER_03]: I bet multiple people are splitting this account.

1298
01:37:07,411 --> 01:37:09,073
[SPEAKER_03]: I bet multiple people contributed to this.

1299
01:37:09,133 --> 01:37:10,534
[SPEAKER_03]: It probably wasn't just one person.

1300
01:37:10,935 --> 01:37:14,598
[SPEAKER_03]: It's still an impressive achievement, though, but at the same time, time to go outside!

1301
01:37:15,683 --> 01:37:18,105
[SPEAKER_03]: There are some achievements in there that are crazy.

1302
01:37:18,245 --> 01:37:26,632
[SPEAKER_03]: One of them is that you have to get exalted with Aldor and then you have to go all the way down to Hated and get exalted with Scryer.

1303
01:37:27,292 --> 01:37:28,954
[SPEAKER_03]: That means nothing to people that don't play WoW.

1304
01:37:29,214 --> 01:37:31,296
[SPEAKER_03]: It means nothing to me.

1305
01:37:31,336 --> 01:37:32,437
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a lot of fucking grinding.

1306
01:37:32,477 --> 01:37:33,337
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's just leave it like that.

1307
01:37:33,397 --> 01:37:35,999
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like trying to gain one level in Final Fantasy XI.

1308
01:37:36,079 --> 01:37:37,320
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a lot of fucking grinding.

1309
01:37:38,061 --> 01:37:39,422
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a great analogy.

1310
01:37:40,643 --> 01:37:42,264
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a fantastic analogy.

1311
01:37:42,425 --> 01:37:43,926
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, and it's accurate too.

1312
01:37:44,725 --> 01:37:50,108
[SPEAKER_07]: Because, I mean, like, for me, I'm like, I can't stand to play with, like, more than two people at a time.

1313
01:37:50,748 --> 01:37:53,289
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I'm like, you're going too fast!

1314
01:37:54,010 --> 01:37:57,051
[SPEAKER_07]: So, just doing all of that would be, like, wince.

1315
01:37:59,392 --> 01:38:06,295
[SPEAKER_03]: I will say though, despite all the crap I give Final Fantasy XI years out, I am super, super excited for Final Fantasy XIV.

1316
01:38:06,675 --> 01:38:12,497
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm already seeing that 2010 will be the year I finally quit WoW because we'll have Final Fantasy XIV and we'll have Star Trek Online.

1317
01:38:12,778 --> 01:38:15,499
[SPEAKER_07]: Star Trek Online is going to completely murder any free time I have.

1318
01:38:16,099 --> 01:38:17,380
[SPEAKER_03]: I know, that's what I'm looking at too.

1319
01:38:17,600 --> 01:38:19,140
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to command a fucking ship.

1320
01:38:19,160 --> 01:38:20,761
[SPEAKER_07]: Did you see what they did to the Borg?

1321
01:38:22,156 --> 01:38:29,320
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been very good about not looking at any previews for it because I want to poop my pants from shock and awe the first day I played it.

1322
01:38:29,340 --> 01:38:33,662
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm still going to poop my pants, but I think that I farted a little bit.

1323
01:38:37,243 --> 01:38:38,484
[SPEAKER_07]: To use your analogy, Rob.

1324
01:38:42,626 --> 01:38:44,026
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't pin that analogy on me.

1325
01:38:44,066 --> 01:38:44,787
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all you.

1326
01:38:45,227 --> 01:38:46,948
[SPEAKER_07]: No, you're the one who said you were going to poop your pants.

1327
01:38:47,728 --> 01:38:49,309
[SPEAKER_07]: I just want to use your same analogy.

1328
01:38:49,369 --> 01:38:49,869
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, fine.

1329
01:38:51,990 --> 01:38:52,751
[SPEAKER_07]: They did cool stuff.

1330
01:38:52,771 --> 01:38:54,352
[SPEAKER_03]: So the Borg made you shard a little bit.

1331
01:38:58,396 --> 01:39:04,941
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, some of the stuff that they were talking about is they were trying to make it to where you could not go back from assimilation.

1332
01:39:05,321 --> 01:39:06,482
[SPEAKER_07]: They replaced your stomach.

1333
01:39:08,164 --> 01:39:08,484
[SPEAKER_11]: Wow.

1334
01:39:08,804 --> 01:39:11,446
[SPEAKER_07]: Because you don't really need to eat when you have a regeneration cycle.

1335
01:39:11,947 --> 01:39:16,310
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm like, wow, these people are geeky on a level that is far beyond my comprehension.

1336
01:39:16,711 --> 01:39:18,292
[SPEAKER_03]: So the Borg won't sh... Never mind.

1337
01:39:18,692 --> 01:39:19,413
[SPEAKER_07]: They can't shit!

1338
01:39:20,570 --> 01:39:23,472
[SPEAKER_07]: Unless they're going to throw up some energy at you or something.

1339
01:39:24,093 --> 01:39:25,334
[SPEAKER_07]: They're going to fart sparks.

1340
01:39:28,756 --> 01:39:30,558
[SPEAKER_07]: Resistance is futile, poot!

1341
01:39:35,822 --> 01:39:39,485
[SPEAKER_03]: This was the moment when OLR got flushed down the toilet.

1342
01:39:39,525 --> 01:39:44,468
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the moment where the episode literally and figuratively went down the...

1343
01:39:49,960 --> 01:39:58,968
[SPEAKER_03]: Rest in Peace Orange Launch Radio 2002-2009 Alright Let's move on with some more gaming news Jamie, can you take us in a non-poopy direction please?

1344
01:40:01,710 --> 01:40:08,195
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry, I'm still laughing my ass off I'm laughing my ass off Are you laughing at what Salacious Pop is saying in chat?

1345
01:40:08,555 --> 01:40:19,044
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not looking They poop Sound Blaster cards from 1998 and laugh at you when they crash your Win 95 I lulled That's pretty damn funny

1346
01:40:20,225 --> 01:40:23,027
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, anyway, okay, so, how about some Tatsunoko vs. Capcom news?

1347
01:40:23,147 --> 01:40:23,607
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, please.

1348
01:40:23,647 --> 01:40:26,289
[SPEAKER_07]: Cause Tatsunoko vs. Capcom is sexy.

1349
01:40:27,009 --> 01:40:29,371
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, so yeah, actually, um...

1350
01:40:30,629 --> 01:40:51,319
[SPEAKER_07]: There is something on one of the Mad Catz employees' flicker that is a Tatsunoko vs. Capcom fighting stick so that you can actually play fighting games without having to contort your fingers to actually use the damn Wii controller, even the classic controller.

1351
01:40:51,339 --> 01:40:53,000
[SPEAKER_03]: I was going to say, the classic controller's not terrible.

1352
01:40:53,500 --> 01:40:54,221
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's not great.

1353
01:40:55,241 --> 01:40:58,323
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like trying to play fighting games on the SNES.

1354
01:40:58,908 --> 01:40:59,489
[SPEAKER_07]: SuperStreetFighter2

1355
01:41:18,274 --> 01:41:30,381
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, anyway, the theory is that it could be possible that it's going to be a bundle, like a normal and then arcade bundle, like Street Fighter 4 had.

1356
01:41:31,502 --> 01:41:33,223
[SPEAKER_07]: And it looks really nice.

1357
01:41:33,443 --> 01:41:33,984
[SPEAKER_07]: I hope so.

1358
01:41:34,664 --> 01:41:46,151
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, because honestly, you know what's funny is that playing fighting games at home, I actually do prefer to play on a good controller over playing it on a joystick, just because of some of my hand problems.

1359
01:41:47,652 --> 01:41:47,812
[SPEAKER_07]: But

1360
01:41:48,668 --> 01:41:50,290
[SPEAKER_07]: I would seriously get this.

1361
01:41:52,031 --> 01:41:52,691
[SPEAKER_07]: It's sexy.

1362
01:41:53,412 --> 01:41:57,275
[SPEAKER_07]: Everybody else's face is covered, except for that crack Ho-Chun Lee.

1363
01:41:57,867 --> 01:41:58,568
[SPEAKER_07]: Kogaki Ninja Tai Gatchaman

1364
01:42:26,565 --> 01:42:31,446
[SPEAKER_07]: Battle of the Planets Battle of the Planets Battle of the Planets Battle of the Planets Battle of the Planets

1365
01:42:52,791 --> 01:42:53,331
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll give you that.

1366
01:42:53,692 --> 01:43:00,675
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, this definitely is catered to the anime convention going crowd, but there's a damn lot of anime convention going people, you know what I mean?

1367
01:43:01,115 --> 01:43:03,337
[SPEAKER_03]: There's enough people that would take interest in a game like this.

1368
01:43:03,357 --> 01:43:04,457
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you see this evil book?

1369
01:43:05,738 --> 01:43:06,158
[SPEAKER_03]: Amano.

1370
01:43:06,298 --> 01:43:07,919
[SPEAKER_07]: I have the giant book of Amano.

1371
01:43:07,979 --> 01:43:11,961
[SPEAKER_07]: He did character designs for Gatchaman and a lot of the early Tatsunoko characters.

1372
01:43:12,822 --> 01:43:14,182
[SPEAKER_07]: So, I'll find it and put a picture up.

1373
01:43:14,843 --> 01:43:15,143
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

1374
01:43:17,244 --> 01:43:17,684
[SPEAKER_03]: Sounds good.

1375
01:43:17,704 --> 01:43:18,785
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, here we go.

1376
01:43:18,805 --> 01:43:19,305
[SPEAKER_07]: Open right to it.

1377
01:43:19,778 --> 01:43:22,661
[SPEAKER_03]: What are you showing me?

1378
01:43:22,801 --> 01:43:24,002
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, some of the characters, I see.

1379
01:43:24,743 --> 01:43:25,504
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, very cool.

1380
01:43:26,505 --> 01:43:27,766
[SPEAKER_03]: This makes for great radio, by the way.

1381
01:43:27,846 --> 01:43:28,347
[SPEAKER_03]: Can I just point out?

1382
01:43:29,888 --> 01:43:30,269
[SPEAKER_03]: Very cool.

1383
01:43:30,309 --> 01:43:32,411
[SPEAKER_03]: Take a picture.

1384
01:43:32,451 --> 01:43:34,573
[SPEAKER_03]: Meanwhile, Loki, let's move on with some more gaming news.

1385
01:43:34,895 --> 01:43:40,040
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, there's a new Xbox Live Arcade game coming out March 2010.

1386
01:43:40,120 --> 01:43:44,865
[SPEAKER_10]: It's called Scourge Project, and it's a third-person shooter game.

1387
01:43:45,826 --> 01:43:50,051
[SPEAKER_10]: It will be coming out on Steam, Xbox Live Arcade, and the PlayStation Network.

1388
01:43:50,111 --> 01:43:52,493
[SPEAKER_10]: What's kind of notable about it is it actually looks really good.

1389
01:43:53,554 --> 01:43:55,857
[SPEAKER_10]: It's being powered by the Unreal 3 engine.

1390
01:43:56,397 --> 01:43:57,939
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1391
01:44:15,422 --> 01:44:18,243
[SPEAKER_10]: and I don't know, it looks pretty awesome.

1392
01:44:18,443 --> 01:44:22,045
[SPEAKER_10]: Really high quality for even like an Xbox Live Arcade game.

1393
01:44:22,165 --> 01:44:28,047
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, kind of almost something that I would expect from a console, just a standard disc release.

1394
01:44:28,747 --> 01:44:31,568
[SPEAKER_10]: But something to definitely look forward to.

1395
01:44:31,688 --> 01:44:38,911
[SPEAKER_10]: It was actually announced back in 2007, but I guess it took them this long to actually get it finished, but eh, whatever.

1396
01:44:39,251 --> 01:44:40,972
[SPEAKER_10]: And like I said, it's scheduled to arrive March 2010.

1397
01:44:41,012 --> 01:44:43,733
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's going to be pretty awesome.

1398
01:44:44,915 --> 01:44:47,077
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1399
01:45:01,733 --> 01:45:02,874
[SPEAKER_03]: and DarkSakura.com.

1400
01:45:22,813 --> 01:45:23,213
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right.

1401
01:45:23,254 --> 01:45:28,219
[SPEAKER_03]: If you've always wanted a pony, you can now have one for the low, low cost of 240 Microsoft points.

1402
01:45:28,640 --> 01:45:29,521
[SPEAKER_03]: In the real world, that's $3.

1403
01:45:31,323 --> 01:45:32,524
[SPEAKER_03]: $3 for a virtual pet.

1404
01:45:33,365 --> 01:45:33,965
[SPEAKER_03]: That's your thing?

1405
01:45:34,526 --> 01:45:35,027
[SPEAKER_03]: Have fun.

1406
01:45:35,547 --> 01:45:36,989
[SPEAKER_10]: What can I do with this virtual pet?

1407
01:45:38,571 --> 01:45:38,671
[SPEAKER_03]: Um...

1408
01:45:40,327 --> 01:45:41,728
[SPEAKER_10]: or is it just going to be like a handbag?

1409
01:45:41,868 --> 01:45:43,190
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, you know, I have the dog.

1410
01:45:43,270 --> 01:45:48,294
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you can see a little picture of the avatar with the dog and I guess they pet it.

1411
01:45:49,695 --> 01:45:50,716
[SPEAKER_03]: Can I have multiple animals?

1412
01:45:50,736 --> 01:45:54,219
[SPEAKER_03]: The dog probably barks, but not really because I don't think the avatar makes sound.

1413
01:45:54,239 --> 01:45:55,340
[SPEAKER_10]: They should allow you to have multiple animals.

1414
01:45:55,400 --> 01:45:59,283
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, I want to be a virtual catwoman in the game and have like 800 cats.

1415
01:45:59,303 --> 01:46:01,345
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you just say you want to be a virtual catwoman?

1416
01:46:01,745 --> 01:46:02,506
[SPEAKER_10]: Did I hear that correctly?

1417
01:46:02,526 --> 01:46:05,769
[SPEAKER_10]: Cat lady, not catwoman as in, like, you know...

1418
01:46:06,349 --> 01:46:07,350
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

1419
01:46:22,242 --> 01:46:22,883
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I want to see.

1420
01:46:23,183 --> 01:46:23,403
[SPEAKER_03]: I see.

1421
01:46:23,423 --> 01:46:25,525
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't want to be like Michelle Pfeiffer or Holly Berry Catwoman.

1422
01:46:25,545 --> 01:46:25,885
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no, no.

1423
01:46:25,925 --> 01:46:26,165
[SPEAKER_03]: God.

1424
01:46:26,226 --> 01:46:29,929
[SPEAKER_03]: You want to be the lady that lives in the shoe that has 500 cats.

1425
01:46:30,249 --> 01:46:30,409
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

1426
01:46:30,469 --> 01:46:31,070
[SPEAKER_03]: That you hear about.

1427
01:46:31,090 --> 01:46:31,991
[SPEAKER_07]: Lives in the shoe?

1428
01:46:32,131 --> 01:46:32,851
[SPEAKER_07]: You hear about.

1429
01:46:32,871 --> 01:46:34,933
[SPEAKER_07]: She has so many cats she didn't know what to do.

1430
01:46:34,953 --> 01:46:42,540
[SPEAKER_03]: I maybe combined a couple things there, but she's the lady you see on the news that, you know, she died in the house and all the cats like, you know, ate her.

1431
01:46:42,580 --> 01:46:43,100
[SPEAKER_03]: Ate her.

1432
01:46:43,540 --> 01:46:48,865
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, you know, suddenly the SPCA doesn't know what to do with all these cats, so they're trying to find homes for 500 cats.

1433
01:46:50,745 --> 01:47:06,331
[SPEAKER_03]: 500 human eating cats exactly I can find a home for them our prison system but they're adorable by the way, I just want to point out people are actually going to spend money on this

1434
01:47:07,386 --> 01:47:07,806
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right.

1435
01:47:08,086 --> 01:47:11,989
[SPEAKER_03]: People will spend $3 so that they can have a cutesy little pet.

1436
01:47:12,009 --> 01:47:13,189
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's my problem.

1437
01:47:13,830 --> 01:47:14,470
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to make a point.

1438
01:47:14,510 --> 01:47:15,270
[SPEAKER_03]: This is very important.

1439
01:47:15,731 --> 01:47:16,991
[SPEAKER_03]: This just proves my point.

1440
01:47:17,311 --> 01:47:18,812
[SPEAKER_03]: And I've said this before on the show.

1441
01:47:19,192 --> 01:47:25,536
[SPEAKER_03]: This will make money because America loves cats.

1442
01:47:26,837 --> 01:47:28,799
[SPEAKER_10]: But the cat they have is a Siamese cat.

1443
01:47:28,899 --> 01:47:30,360
[SPEAKER_10]: That's unacceptable.

1444
01:47:30,400 --> 01:47:31,200
[SPEAKER_03]: There's other cats, too.

1445
01:47:31,241 --> 01:47:32,321
[SPEAKER_10]: No, there's just a Siamese cat.

1446
01:47:32,341 --> 01:47:33,562
[SPEAKER_03]: There's the long-haired cat.

1447
01:47:34,063 --> 01:47:35,604
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, well, I don't have a long-haired cat.

1448
01:47:35,684 --> 01:47:37,265
[SPEAKER_10]: I want a cat that looks like my cat.

1449
01:47:37,486 --> 01:47:39,527
[SPEAKER_07]: I have Shermie that sheds enough for 50 cats.

1450
01:47:41,269 --> 01:47:45,772
[SPEAKER_07]: By the way, the Final Fight guy pictures are up at the Orange Zones Radio Gallery.

1451
01:47:46,933 --> 01:47:51,757
[SPEAKER_03]: I want a guy cat that wears an orange jumpsuit and karate kicks intruders.

1452
01:47:51,817 --> 01:47:52,558
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I want.

1453
01:47:53,939 --> 01:47:54,799
[SPEAKER_03]: That I might pay $3 for.

1454
01:47:57,867 --> 01:48:02,155
[SPEAKER_03]: whatever, it's your money spend it on whatever makes you happy that's what I say

1455
01:48:03,732 --> 01:48:04,272
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

1456
01:48:29,360 --> 01:48:56,728
[SPEAKER_03]: funny how that works that sometimes we get like 100 twitters like we got tonight and then no emails and some nights we'll have like 50 emails and no twitters or something else alright so we'll roll over and don't email us now it's going to do no good you missed your chance so we'll roll them over to next week so there you go but there's always time for ranting and usually right after the mailbag we take a moment to rant about something and this week's no different we have the FUs of the week

1457
01:49:12,725 --> 01:49:17,770
[SPEAKER_03]: We have a story tonight to inspire the FUs, just to get your ranting warmed up a little bit.

1458
01:49:18,190 --> 01:49:33,585
[SPEAKER_03]: And that is that a Florida father apparently was arrested and thrown in the slammer for getting high, gaming all night long, and then falling asleep on his seven-month-old daughter.

1459
01:49:34,286 --> 01:49:36,347
[SPEAKER_03]: which suffocated the poor thing to death.

1460
01:49:36,827 --> 01:49:49,630
[SPEAKER_03]: His name, EmanuelLawrence30, and he finished a marathon game session at 6am, and he laid her on the bed next to him, rolled over, and dot dot dot, I don't need to describe what else happened.

1461
01:49:50,030 --> 01:49:51,771
[SPEAKER_03]: This makes me angry for two reasons.

1462
01:49:52,131 --> 01:49:55,592
[SPEAKER_03]: One, I think it's pretty obvious, he was an idiot.

1463
01:49:56,172 --> 01:49:56,452
[SPEAKER_03]: Two...

1464
01:49:57,631 --> 01:50:08,038
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm seeing this on game blogs, and with all due respect to the lovely people that work very hard on game blogs, this story has nothing to do with gaming, and it shouldn't... This guy's an idiot.

1465
01:50:08,098 --> 01:50:08,979
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the problem.

1466
01:50:09,099 --> 01:50:15,384
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, the fact that he was gaming all night long, he could have just been easily watching movies or doing something else.

1467
01:50:15,404 --> 01:50:16,504
[SPEAKER_03]: It has nothing to do with games.

1468
01:50:16,665 --> 01:50:23,129
[SPEAKER_03]: So don't run it on the game blogs, because it just supports that notion that somehow it was connected to the games, when we all know it wasn't.

1469
01:50:23,429 --> 01:50:25,471
[SPEAKER_03]: He was just a stupid, stupid head.

1470
01:50:26,511 --> 01:50:27,431
[SPEAKER_10]: Stupid, stupid head.

1471
01:50:27,672 --> 01:50:30,853
[SPEAKER_03]: And for that, he can go live with the 500 human-eating cats for all I care.

1472
01:50:31,213 --> 01:50:34,034
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, your FU of the week, please.

1473
01:50:34,875 --> 01:50:37,356
[SPEAKER_07]: FU to the wimpy California people.

1474
01:50:38,497 --> 01:50:40,117
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just a little snow.

1475
01:50:40,798 --> 01:50:42,498
[SPEAKER_07]: If you really don't... I'm excited.

1476
01:50:44,019 --> 01:50:45,020
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not really excited either.

1477
01:50:45,040 --> 01:50:46,720
[SPEAKER_07]: I actually feel really indifferent about the whole thing.

1478
01:50:47,361 --> 01:50:50,222
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just like... Well, I suppose it's novel.

1479
01:50:51,182 --> 01:50:54,384
[SPEAKER_07]: But at the same time, I'm like, dude, if you're afraid of people on the road, don't go out.

1480
01:50:54,404 --> 01:50:54,484
[SPEAKER_07]: Dude.

1481
01:50:55,723 --> 01:50:57,987
[SPEAKER_07]: If you have to go to work, drive safely.

1482
01:50:58,928 --> 01:51:00,551
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to call in Snow to work tomorrow.

1483
01:51:00,992 --> 01:51:02,875
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, they also sent us that warning.

1484
01:51:03,255 --> 01:51:07,823
[SPEAKER_07]: And by the way, thank you for sending me the warning while I'm in the middle of doing really good stitches.

1485
01:51:08,263 --> 01:51:09,505
[SPEAKER_07]: And also, fuck this hat.

1486
01:51:12,230 --> 01:51:14,092
[SPEAKER_03]: My husband just arrived.

1487
01:51:16,053 --> 01:51:18,315
[SPEAKER_10]: F you to people trying to sell me shit at my house.

1488
01:51:18,435 --> 01:51:22,398
[SPEAKER_10]: I hate hearing the doorbell ring and going to the door and not recognizing the person.

1489
01:51:22,979 --> 01:51:26,602
[SPEAKER_10]: I always assume that maybe it's a kid that threw a ball into our backyard or something like that.

1490
01:51:27,748 --> 01:51:34,414
[SPEAKER_10]: Dumb me answers the door and it's always someone trying to sell shit or someone that wants cans for me to donate to them for shit.

1491
01:51:34,654 --> 01:51:37,357
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't have your fucking- Are you sure you don't want a subscription to the SACB?

1492
01:51:37,377 --> 01:51:38,358
[SPEAKER_11]: No, I don't want a subscription.

1493
01:51:38,378 --> 01:51:40,900
[SPEAKER_11]: Because if you don't subscribe, I'm gonna die.

1494
01:51:41,340 --> 01:51:42,642
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not gonna be able to go on my trip.

1495
01:51:42,682 --> 01:51:44,864
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not gonna get my $1000 scholarship!

1496
01:51:44,904 --> 01:51:46,785
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm gonna be stupid!

1497
01:51:47,961 --> 01:51:48,762
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't give a fuck.

1498
01:51:48,782 --> 01:51:56,629
[SPEAKER_10]: You're an idiot already if you think that you're going to get a $1,000 scholarship from the SACB for walking door-to-door to sell their fucking subscriptions.

1499
01:51:57,089 --> 01:51:58,030
[SPEAKER_10]: You're an idiot.

1500
01:51:58,450 --> 01:52:05,516
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe you should have been smarter in the first place and you wouldn't have to walk door-to-door selling subscriptions to newspapers.

1501
01:52:05,977 --> 01:52:12,863
[SPEAKER_10]: Instead, you'd be earning a scholarship from, I don't know, someone that celebrates academic excellence.

1502
01:52:14,161 --> 01:52:14,701
[SPEAKER_10]: You're an idiot.

1503
01:52:15,201 --> 01:52:17,362
[SPEAKER_10]: And I don't want your fucking SACB subscriptions.

1504
01:52:18,082 --> 01:52:19,343
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't care how you give them to me.

1505
01:52:19,503 --> 01:52:23,625
[SPEAKER_10]: Get the fuck out!

1506
01:52:24,065 --> 01:52:27,166
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm in a pretty good mood today, so I don't really have a lot of FUs.

1507
01:52:27,526 --> 01:52:28,907
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess FU to traffic.

1508
01:52:29,347 --> 01:52:33,168
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, people driving to San Francisco don't know what they're doing and need to stop.

1509
01:52:33,268 --> 01:52:34,008
[SPEAKER_03]: Get off my bridge.

1510
01:52:35,469 --> 01:52:37,970
[SPEAKER_03]: FU to the S-curve on the bridge, too, for slowing everything down.

1511
01:52:38,030 --> 01:52:40,291
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, you know a lot of people, a lot of trucks have been running off of it.

1512
01:52:41,018 --> 01:52:41,699
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you hear about that?

1513
01:52:41,859 --> 01:52:42,659
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you hear about that?

1514
01:53:11,561 --> 01:53:15,284
[SPEAKER_10]: There should be grinders and explosions at the bottom of the hill.

1515
01:53:15,404 --> 01:53:17,305
[SPEAKER_03]: And most importantly, human-eating cats.

1516
01:53:17,605 --> 01:53:18,486
[SPEAKER_10]: Human-eating cats.

1517
01:53:18,526 --> 01:53:19,207
[SPEAKER_03]: Living in the bay.

1518
01:53:19,527 --> 01:53:21,868
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what they did at Alcatraz, actually.

1519
01:53:21,969 --> 01:53:23,590
[SPEAKER_03]: That's how people didn't escape Alcatraz.

1520
01:53:23,830 --> 01:53:25,311
[SPEAKER_03]: They had human-eating cats in the water.

1521
01:53:25,331 --> 01:53:25,851
[SPEAKER_03]: Cat sharks.

1522
01:53:25,891 --> 01:53:26,612
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right, cat sharks.

1523
01:53:26,632 --> 01:53:27,152
[SPEAKER_03]: True story.

1524
01:53:27,332 --> 01:53:27,773
[SPEAKER_03]: Look it up.

1525
01:53:27,873 --> 01:53:29,134
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right, it's on Wikipedia.

1526
01:53:30,495 --> 01:53:31,716
[SPEAKER_10]: Quick, put it on Wikipedia.

1527
01:53:32,856 --> 01:53:37,740
[SPEAKER_03]: Couple more stories for you guys, and then we're going to get to your stories on our Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR.

1528
01:53:37,780 --> 01:53:39,081
[SPEAKER_03]: But first, some Skype stories.

1529
01:53:40,905 --> 01:53:41,405
[SPEAKER_03]: Skype stories?

1530
01:53:41,425 --> 01:53:41,806
[SPEAKER_03]: What the hell?

1531
01:53:42,066 --> 01:53:44,968
[SPEAKER_03]: The Skype line, then some last stories before we get to the Skype line.

1532
01:53:45,348 --> 01:53:46,529
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm dyslexic today.

1533
01:53:46,549 --> 01:53:47,269
[SPEAKER_03]: It's crazy.

1534
01:53:47,689 --> 01:53:52,232
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm putting up the last of the Amano pictures right now.

1535
01:53:53,453 --> 01:53:54,154
[SPEAKER_07]: So they should be up.

1536
01:53:54,334 --> 01:53:54,574
[SPEAKER_03]: Run.

1537
01:53:54,674 --> 01:53:55,074
[SPEAKER_03]: Go look.

1538
01:53:55,274 --> 01:53:55,535
[SPEAKER_03]: Quick.

1539
01:53:56,755 --> 01:54:02,179
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, if you're in Japan, there's definitely your share of adult games available out there.

1540
01:54:02,899 --> 01:54:03,040
[SPEAKER_10]: And...

1541
01:54:04,850 --> 01:54:05,811
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura.com

1542
01:54:19,929 --> 01:54:29,451
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, this game you can also get with a collector's edition that's bundled with a special manga, an audio CD, and a personal assistant.

1543
01:54:30,172 --> 01:54:34,213
[SPEAKER_10]: No, that's not a person that takes down notation for you and brings you coffee.

1544
01:54:34,793 --> 01:54:36,273
[SPEAKER_10]: It is a pocket pussy.

1545
01:54:37,453 --> 01:54:39,734
[SPEAKER_10]: It is a rubber thing that you put your penis in.

1546
01:54:40,234 --> 01:54:41,374
[SPEAKER_03]: A fleshlight, basically?

1547
01:54:42,094 --> 01:54:42,975
[SPEAKER_10]: Without the fleshlight.

1548
01:54:43,035 --> 01:54:44,555
[SPEAKER_07]: No, they're called ona cups.

1549
01:54:45,435 --> 01:54:46,836
[SPEAKER_07]: As in, woman cup.

1550
01:54:47,936 --> 01:54:48,176
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.

1551
01:54:48,766 --> 01:54:50,788
[SPEAKER_07]: Just go to J-List and look at all this stuff.

1552
01:54:50,848 --> 01:54:52,630
[SPEAKER_03]: I really don't need to.

1553
01:54:53,311 --> 01:54:54,893
[SPEAKER_03]: I have commercials for them.

1554
01:54:54,913 --> 01:54:55,333
[SPEAKER_07]: It's hilarious.

1555
01:54:55,353 --> 01:54:57,536
[SPEAKER_10]: My life will be fine without it, actually.

1556
01:54:57,556 --> 01:54:59,017
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's funny looking at the commercials.

1557
01:54:59,157 --> 01:55:00,899
[SPEAKER_10]: And it will be released in Christmas.

1558
01:55:01,720 --> 01:55:02,781
[SPEAKER_10]: Or during Christmas.

1559
01:55:03,202 --> 01:55:04,984
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, just in time for the holidays.

1560
01:55:05,324 --> 01:55:06,445
[SPEAKER_03]: Just what I always wanted.

1561
01:55:06,485 --> 01:55:08,187
[SPEAKER_03]: A pocket pussy to take with me.

1562
01:55:09,068 --> 01:55:17,530
[SPEAKER_03]: I did love, though, you gotta share the artwork for the game with our chatters, because I love the unnaturally large breasts that the women had.

1563
01:55:17,630 --> 01:55:20,271
[SPEAKER_03]: They were larger than Springer Large, okay?

1564
01:55:20,291 --> 01:55:24,172
[SPEAKER_03]: Like Jerry Springer's show, when he has the women with the unnaturally large titties.

1565
01:55:24,312 --> 01:55:25,572
[SPEAKER_10]: That's gonna cause some back pain.

1566
01:55:25,592 --> 01:55:26,372
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a Z-cup.

1567
01:55:26,412 --> 01:55:27,513
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's some back pain.

1568
01:55:27,873 --> 01:55:29,953
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't believe she doesn't walk over with a hunch.

1569
01:55:30,193 --> 01:55:31,954
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, that is just amazing.

1570
01:55:35,014 --> 01:55:36,875
[SPEAKER_10]: That is some serious...

1571
01:55:38,368 --> 01:55:42,730
[SPEAKER_10]: Seriously large boobies there.

1572
01:55:42,750 --> 01:55:46,271
[SPEAKER_10]: I kind of laugh at some of the stuff that I've seen.

1573
01:55:46,511 --> 01:55:54,054
[SPEAKER_10]: They've got the booby pillows or the booby mouse pads and stuff like that.

1574
01:55:55,675 --> 01:55:56,675
[SPEAKER_10]: That's just a little much.

1575
01:55:59,336 --> 01:56:00,896
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, I'm laughing at a comment in chat.

1576
01:56:01,377 --> 01:56:07,279
[SPEAKER_03]: Salacious Pop comments, I'd carry a pocket pussy with me, but only to give friends sudden nose kisses.

1577
01:56:09,505 --> 01:56:12,508
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my god, if someone did that to me, I think I'd slap them.

1578
01:56:13,630 --> 01:56:15,752
[SPEAKER_03]: Although the mental image is really funny.

1579
01:56:15,792 --> 01:56:17,093
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you imagine walking up to someone?

1580
01:56:17,454 --> 01:56:17,994
[SPEAKER_10]: I kiss you!

1581
01:56:19,256 --> 01:56:21,698
[SPEAKER_10]: Wow, their website is sure detailed.

1582
01:56:22,099 --> 01:56:22,339
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

1583
01:56:23,260 --> 01:56:28,446
[SPEAKER_10]: And I guess they have different ones depending on which woman that you want to... Oh well, whoopee!

1584
01:56:29,997 --> 01:56:32,418
[SPEAKER_03]: Like different depths and widths and everything?

1585
01:56:32,678 --> 01:56:33,739
[SPEAKER_03]: Are they all loose?

1586
01:56:33,839 --> 01:56:34,639
[SPEAKER_03]: They're all different.

1587
01:56:34,679 --> 01:56:36,019
[SPEAKER_03]: The women in this game, clearly.

1588
01:56:36,059 --> 01:56:37,580
[SPEAKER_10]: They've got different patterns in there.

1589
01:56:37,620 --> 01:56:45,083
[SPEAKER_10]: See, you've got the one chick there, the blue, and it looks like nubs and ribs and something else.

1590
01:56:45,363 --> 01:56:50,765
[SPEAKER_03]: That looks like a diagram that you see in a geology book about what it would look like if you drilled to the center of the Earth.

1591
01:56:51,205 --> 01:56:52,886
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what that looks like to me.

1592
01:56:53,666 --> 01:56:55,907
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, well, you're drilling to the center of the Earth, all right.

1593
01:56:56,207 --> 01:56:57,088
[SPEAKER_03]: Shut up, you ass.

1594
01:56:58,007 --> 01:57:01,390
[SPEAKER_10]: And then that one right there looks like a spine and a screw at the top there.

1595
01:57:01,450 --> 01:57:01,630
[SPEAKER_03]: It does.

1596
01:57:01,690 --> 01:57:02,932
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks like an MRI picture.

1597
01:57:03,032 --> 01:57:09,497
[SPEAKER_10]: And that one's got kind of like some sort of DNA helix thing going on there.

1598
01:57:09,658 --> 01:57:10,038
[SPEAKER_03]: Wait a minute.

1599
01:57:10,538 --> 01:57:12,260
[SPEAKER_03]: Is this radio really happening right now?

1600
01:57:12,280 --> 01:57:14,622
[SPEAKER_03]: We're describing pocket pussies on our radio program?

1601
01:57:14,642 --> 01:57:15,963
[SPEAKER_10]: That's not going to help our chat room.

1602
01:57:16,003 --> 01:57:17,044
[SPEAKER_10]: I've got to link this into the chat room.

1603
01:57:17,084 --> 01:57:17,845
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, you do.

1604
01:57:18,445 --> 01:57:18,926
[SPEAKER_07]: The commercials.

1605
01:57:19,146 --> 01:57:20,287
[SPEAKER_07]: The commercials are hilarious.

1606
01:57:22,549 --> 01:57:23,130
[SPEAKER_03]: No, thank you.

1607
01:57:25,453 --> 01:57:27,294
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, Rob, they do make vibrators.

1608
01:57:30,156 --> 01:57:31,017
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, it was funny.

1609
01:57:31,057 --> 01:57:36,781
[SPEAKER_10]: The other day we were watching and this is the perfect use of our PS3.

1610
01:57:37,801 --> 01:57:41,144
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, and of course, the one that looks like they're underage, of course, is in there.

1611
01:57:42,244 --> 01:57:42,865
[SPEAKER_10]: You gotta love that.

1612
01:57:43,885 --> 01:57:44,286
[SPEAKER_03]: Yay.

1613
01:57:45,326 --> 01:57:54,613
[SPEAKER_10]: No, there is like, they had an interactive device or whatever that you would buy for your PC that's for porno use or whatever, but it's interactive, you see, because it's

1614
01:57:55,590 --> 01:58:08,636
[SPEAKER_03]: I just got a picture of Marissa and she said, were the boobies bigger than mine?

1615
01:58:09,516 --> 01:58:10,136
[SPEAKER_03]: Not by much!

1616
01:58:11,597 --> 01:58:12,197
[SPEAKER_03]: Not by much.

1617
01:58:12,237 --> 01:58:13,417
[SPEAKER_03]: That's an impressive picture.

1618
01:58:13,438 --> 01:58:15,078
[SPEAKER_07]: Marissa has the best rack ever.

1619
01:58:15,198 --> 01:58:16,719
[SPEAKER_03]: That is an impressive picture.

1620
01:58:19,141 --> 01:58:22,883
[SPEAKER_03]: I am completely secure in my homosexuality, okay?

1621
01:58:23,204 --> 01:58:26,686
[SPEAKER_03]: I am 100% secure in my fagness.

1622
01:58:26,987 --> 01:58:29,228
[SPEAKER_03]: But I want to bury my face in that.

1623
01:58:29,909 --> 01:58:30,769
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't explain it.

1624
01:58:30,789 --> 01:58:38,115
[SPEAKER_07]: That's because you have something that's built into male DNA, whether you're gay or not, that boobies are important.

1625
01:58:38,915 --> 01:58:39,716
[SPEAKER_07]: Were you breastfed, Rob?

1626
01:58:40,757 --> 01:58:40,917
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

1627
01:58:41,717 --> 01:58:42,338
[SPEAKER_07]: That could be part of it.

1628
01:58:42,799 --> 01:58:44,300
[SPEAKER_03]: Link, Link, Link, Link, Link, please, please, Link, Link, please

1629
01:59:06,365 --> 01:59:08,546
[SPEAKER_03]: And Marissa says, gay man motorboat me all the time.

1630
01:59:08,846 --> 01:59:14,827
[SPEAKER_03]: I tell you, if you post that link in chat, it's going to get really quiet in chat for about the next five minutes.

1631
01:59:16,688 --> 01:59:18,548
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyhow, one more story for you guys.

1632
01:59:20,369 --> 01:59:24,130
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we're going to get to the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR.

1633
01:59:24,350 --> 01:59:27,130
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're going to travel the world here a little bit and go to Brazil.

1634
01:59:27,791 --> 01:59:31,572
[SPEAKER_03]: And it sounds like Brazil is following in the footsteps of some other places around the world.

1635
01:59:33,343 --> 01:59:33,983
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for watching.

1636
01:59:34,023 --> 01:59:34,483
[SPEAKER_03]: See you next time.

1637
01:59:54,710 --> 01:59:55,510
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, it's in there twice.

1638
01:59:55,811 --> 02:00:03,294
[SPEAKER_03]: Trading and custody, storage of the video games that affect the customs and traditions of the people, their worship, creeds, religions, and symbols.

1639
02:00:03,794 --> 02:00:13,439
[SPEAKER_03]: In other words, they're basically trying to eliminate video games in bad taste, which could be violent video games and lots of things among that route.

1640
02:00:13,899 --> 02:00:14,399
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?

1641
02:00:14,680 --> 02:00:17,001
[SPEAKER_03]: They've tried to do that many places and it never works.

1642
02:00:17,601 --> 02:00:23,064
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, Brazil isn't this country, but it would be sad to hear about that.

1643
02:00:27,321 --> 02:00:30,904
[SPEAKER_03]: Just learn from... You can't stop freedom of expression.

1644
02:00:32,745 --> 02:00:39,851
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, as much as this, like, fleshlight pocket pussy thing is ridiculous, I love the fact that it can be made.

1645
02:00:40,291 --> 02:00:40,872
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?

1646
02:00:41,492 --> 02:00:43,834
[SPEAKER_03]: The fact that it exists brings me lulz.

1647
02:00:45,715 --> 02:00:45,856
[SPEAKER_03]: So...

1648
02:00:47,529 --> 02:00:55,455
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, anyhow, we're going to go to the Skype line now, 1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

1649
02:00:55,475 --> 02:00:58,737
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want to give us a call, we're going to take some calls right now.

1650
02:00:58,898 --> 02:01:01,640
[SPEAKER_03]: The Skype line is open for business, taking your calls.

1651
02:01:02,260 --> 02:01:05,863
[SPEAKER_03]: In the meantime, some last minute stories while we wait for the little delay there.

1652
02:01:05,903 --> 02:01:07,044
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, I don't know if you have anything to say.

1653
02:01:07,064 --> 02:01:07,344
[SPEAKER_03]: I have one.

1654
02:01:07,704 --> 02:01:08,545
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yes, Dark Sakura.

1655
02:01:08,605 --> 02:01:09,145
[SPEAKER_07]: Boobs are great.

1656
02:01:09,586 --> 02:01:10,686
[SPEAKER_03]: The end.

1657
02:01:11,027 --> 02:01:12,928
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're getting a call, so let's take the phone.

1658
02:01:13,489 --> 02:01:14,669
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1659
02:01:14,690 --> 02:01:15,030
[SPEAKER_03]: Who's this?

1660
02:01:16,907 --> 02:01:18,148
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, this is Spazinator.

1661
02:01:18,308 --> 02:01:18,868
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, Spazinator.

1662
02:01:18,888 --> 02:01:19,548
[SPEAKER_03]: What's on your mind tonight?

1663
02:01:21,909 --> 02:01:23,970
[SPEAKER_01]: Two things.

1664
02:01:24,030 --> 02:01:30,133
[SPEAKER_01]: First, so far, this episode's got to be the best episode of all hours so far.

1665
02:01:30,754 --> 02:01:31,814
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, thank you very much.

1666
02:01:32,634 --> 02:01:34,695
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it because it's very porn-tastic tonight?

1667
02:01:37,417 --> 02:01:38,597
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry.

1668
02:01:38,657 --> 02:01:40,878
[SPEAKER_01]: With my ear infections, it's kind of hard to hear you.

1669
02:01:40,978 --> 02:01:41,959
[SPEAKER_01]: Could you repeat that, please?

1670
02:01:42,039 --> 02:01:42,499
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all right.

1671
02:01:42,559 --> 02:01:44,280
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it because we're porn-tastic tonight?

1672
02:01:46,178 --> 02:01:49,041
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah, I mean, well, not just that, you cover your what?

1673
02:01:49,421 --> 02:01:53,024
[SPEAKER_01]: Boobs, vaginas, and bodily functions.

1674
02:01:53,184 --> 02:02:00,310
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, um, yeah, I, uh, there's probably stuff you're probably missing, but I, you can't think of it off the top of my head.

1675
02:02:00,330 --> 02:02:01,992
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, well, yeah, to, uh, get into the main point of my call, um,

1676
02:02:12,935 --> 02:02:18,179
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I kind of want to touch on something that you were mentioning towards the beginning of the show.

1677
02:02:18,520 --> 02:02:19,380
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

1678
02:02:20,501 --> 02:02:25,065
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, mainly the whole rumor of the PSP Go add-on.

1679
02:02:25,085 --> 02:02:39,397
[SPEAKER_01]: And it kind of relates to the whole, you know, whatchamacallit, project mentality and the motion controller for the PSP, you know, PS3 as well in a sense.

1680
02:02:40,234 --> 02:02:49,542
[SPEAKER_01]: It's probably a good idea that the PSP add-on doesn't come out, simply because of one simple reason.

1681
02:02:49,602 --> 02:02:59,950
[SPEAKER_01]: Traditionally speaking, add-ons for systems do really, really horrible in terms of sales and whatnot.

1682
02:03:00,651 --> 02:03:03,774
[SPEAKER_01]: Classic examples are the Sega CD, the 32X.

1683
02:03:07,440 --> 02:03:16,623
[SPEAKER_01]: and more recently the 360's HD DVD add-on and the PlayStation 2's hard drive.

1684
02:03:17,363 --> 02:03:19,384
[SPEAKER_01]: That did lousy.

1685
02:03:20,905 --> 02:03:34,769
[SPEAKER_01]: The simple reason for that is that add-ons kind of like splintered the market a little bit and game manufacturers can't rely on

1686
02:03:36,231 --> 02:03:39,154
[SPEAKER_01]: and people buying these add-ons.

1687
02:03:40,315 --> 02:03:46,821
[SPEAKER_01]: And therefore, they tend to shy away from catering to these add-ons.

1688
02:03:47,581 --> 02:03:51,505
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot of add-ons that don't do very well because they're not very well supported.

1689
02:03:51,545 --> 02:03:53,827
[SPEAKER_03]: They're made for one game and then that's it.

1690
02:03:53,887 --> 02:03:58,091
[SPEAKER_03]: You can go back through gaming's history and there's just tons of stuff that just wasn't very well supported.

1691
02:03:59,111 --> 02:03:59,832
[SPEAKER_03]: The Super Scope 6...

1692
02:04:02,234 --> 02:04:06,215
[SPEAKER_03]: But some were also very good on the other side because they got a lot of support for them.

1693
02:04:06,255 --> 02:04:12,737
[SPEAKER_03]: Like DDR Mats did very well because the games that came out with them, there was a ton of them and folks got use out of them.

1694
02:04:12,777 --> 02:04:15,038
[SPEAKER_03]: And the guitar peripherals do very well too.

1695
02:04:15,118 --> 02:04:23,761
[SPEAKER_03]: But don't forget too, the biggest difference here when you're talking about the PSP and what we were talking about at the beginning of the show is that you're having an add-on for something that should have been there in the first place.

1696
02:04:23,781 --> 02:04:30,263
[SPEAKER_03]: It's ridiculous that you would get this add-on if you just go buy the PSP 3000 if you want a UMD.

1697
02:04:30,383 --> 02:04:31,683
[SPEAKER_03]: It makes no sense at all.

1698
02:04:33,328 --> 02:04:43,015
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you definitely got a point there in both cases.

1699
02:04:43,255 --> 02:04:59,687
[SPEAKER_01]: And also, like you mentioned, the DDR maps and Rock Band, Guitar Hero stuff does sell well, but you gotta bear in mind that that kind of stuff is kind of in a minority sense, and

1700
02:05:00,851 --> 02:05:06,473
[SPEAKER_01]: The companies that put those stuff out are taking a really, really major risk with that stuff.

1701
02:05:07,553 --> 02:05:28,501
[SPEAKER_01]: And in terms of Project Natal and Sony's motion controller, sure, I'm willing to bet that there will be some early adopters that will probably get it for the novelty of it, and probably would use that stuff for a while, up until the novelty wears off.

1702
02:05:28,789 --> 02:05:48,057
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you know what, peripherals, I think to some extent peripherals give sometimes developers, I think right now, a false sense of security because DDR's done so well, because Guitar Hero's done so well, but I think Tony Hawk at the right is going to bring them right back to reminding folks that peripherals don't always make the game, that's for sure, and especially the amount that folks spend on it.

1703
02:05:49,058 --> 02:05:50,979
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, true.

1704
02:05:51,279 --> 02:05:58,182
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, the only reason the Wii's remote and nunchuck did well

1705
02:05:58,880 --> 02:06:04,185
[SPEAKER_01]: is because, in a sense, Nintendo got it right where they packed that stuff in.

1706
02:06:04,625 --> 02:06:06,087
[SPEAKER_03]: Right, and that was the system.

1707
02:06:06,287 --> 02:06:07,968
[SPEAKER_03]: Every single game has to support it.

1708
02:06:08,008 --> 02:06:10,270
[SPEAKER_03]: Therefore, there's plenty of games out there that support it.

1709
02:06:10,551 --> 02:06:16,856
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's very interesting, isn't it, that sometimes folks complain about the Wii is that they should make some games that don't support it.

1710
02:06:17,016 --> 02:06:19,378
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, that don't overdo it with the motion controls.

1711
02:06:19,879 --> 02:06:21,240
[SPEAKER_03]: The Wii's been very interesting.

1712
02:06:21,420 --> 02:06:22,041
[SPEAKER_03]: Very interesting.

1713
02:06:23,817 --> 02:06:24,699
[SPEAKER_03]: No, not that I can't go.

1714
02:06:32,981 --> 02:06:33,441
[SPEAKER_03]: Have a good one.

1715
02:06:56,072 --> 02:06:56,953
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, sure.

1716
02:06:57,113 --> 02:07:00,075
[SPEAKER_10]: Mirror's Edge is going to be coming to the iPhone soon.

1717
02:07:00,115 --> 02:07:02,237
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a little bit different than the normal Mirror's Edge.

1718
02:07:02,277 --> 02:07:06,801
[SPEAKER_10]: It's actually kind of more of a side-scroll game, but it's still 3D.

1719
02:07:07,101 --> 02:07:07,542
[SPEAKER_10]: It looks neat.

1720
02:07:08,846 --> 02:07:09,747
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

1721
02:07:09,767 --> 02:07:10,108
[SPEAKER_03]: Who's this?

1722
02:07:11,009 --> 02:07:12,250
[SPEAKER_03]: It's Ranma, one more time.

1723
02:07:12,350 --> 02:07:12,811
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, Ranma.

1724
02:07:12,831 --> 02:07:13,391
[SPEAKER_03]: What's on your mind?

1725
02:07:13,612 --> 02:07:14,833
[SPEAKER_03]: Lucky you, getting through two weeks in a row.

1726
02:07:14,853 --> 02:07:15,273
[SPEAKER_05]: Not too much.

1727
02:07:16,995 --> 02:07:19,498
[SPEAKER_05]: A couple of quick things, and I'll be on my merry little way.

1728
02:07:20,419 --> 02:07:26,626
[SPEAKER_05]: First thing is, I don't know if you saw, but I made a retweet about President Cat coming to the U.S.

1729
02:07:27,747 --> 02:07:28,328
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you see that?

1730
02:07:28,548 --> 02:07:29,930
[SPEAKER_03]: No, wait, like for real?

1731
02:07:30,922 --> 02:07:40,189
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, someone on Twitter, going by the name of SMAT454, whose real name is Matt Cokes, made a tweet to Renoise saying that President Cat's coming to the U.S.

1732
02:07:40,649 --> 02:07:40,989
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh-huh.

1733
02:07:42,110 --> 02:07:47,214
[SPEAKER_05]: And I retweeted it, but it just kind of fell right in the water, so I don't know if you guys had heard about it.

1734
02:07:47,234 --> 02:07:47,714
[SPEAKER_03]: When was it?

1735
02:07:47,774 --> 02:07:48,375
[SPEAKER_03]: Was it today?

1736
02:07:49,376 --> 02:07:51,337
[SPEAKER_05]: No, actually, this was about three days ago.

1737
02:07:52,778 --> 02:07:53,539
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I didn't see it.

1738
02:07:53,579 --> 02:07:55,300
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been bad on keeping current on Twitter.

1739
02:07:55,320 --> 02:07:56,561
[SPEAKER_03]: Would I see it on Renoise Twitter?

1740
02:07:57,472 --> 02:08:00,994
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, and I actually have the Twitter page up.

1741
02:08:01,054 --> 02:08:02,155
[SPEAKER_05]: I can put it in the chat room.

1742
02:08:02,555 --> 02:08:07,759
[SPEAKER_05]: And even though it makes for great radio, it's twitter.com slash smat454.

1743
02:08:07,799 --> 02:08:11,661
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, wait, now they're saying President Cat the Revolution is coming to the U.S.

1744
02:08:12,142 --> 02:08:15,824
[SPEAKER_03]: They're just talking about the fever, President Cat fever.

1745
02:08:15,864 --> 02:08:16,885
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think they mean a game.

1746
02:08:18,626 --> 02:08:21,608
[SPEAKER_03]: If you look at a couple tweets before that, they're saying President Cat for the win.

1747
02:08:22,008 --> 02:08:23,229
[SPEAKER_03]: We need President Cat.

1748
02:08:23,489 --> 02:08:24,910
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think they're talking about the actual game.

1749
02:08:25,010 --> 02:08:25,391
[SPEAKER_03]: I wish.

1750
02:08:25,771 --> 02:08:26,872
[SPEAKER_03]: He's probably a listener to this program.

1751
02:08:27,732 --> 02:08:34,213
[SPEAKER_05]: Probably so, but when it came across to my feed, I'm automatically assuming, wait, someone picked up the rights to the game, it's coming over, you know?

1752
02:08:36,134 --> 02:08:42,995
[SPEAKER_03]: I wish, but if these stories about the fact that it only sold 100 copies are true, maybe it won't happen, but, you know, again, I gotta be careful.

1753
02:08:43,155 --> 02:08:46,176
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want to make this the President and Cat show, but my point still stands.

1754
02:08:46,516 --> 02:08:50,217
[SPEAKER_03]: This game would sell if it came out here, and it will sell much more than 100 copies.

1755
02:08:50,977 --> 02:08:52,637
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, hell, they made a sequel to We Cheer.

1756
02:08:53,577 --> 02:08:54,297
[SPEAKER_03]: I know, right?

1757
02:08:55,218 --> 02:08:56,898
[SPEAKER_03]: And Muscle, hello, Muscle March.

1758
02:08:57,825 --> 02:08:58,526
[SPEAKER_03]: End of argument.

1759
02:08:59,868 --> 02:09:02,231
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, you got a valid point on that one, yeah.

1760
02:09:03,513 --> 02:09:04,074
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.

1761
02:09:04,114 --> 02:09:06,177
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, anything else on your mind tonight, DJ Ranma?

1762
02:09:07,338 --> 02:09:08,179
[SPEAKER_05]: Something interesting.

1763
02:09:08,840 --> 02:09:11,203
[SPEAKER_05]: Saturday I called Best Buy.

1764
02:09:11,484 --> 02:09:13,006
[SPEAKER_05]: I had an issue about my TV set.

1765
02:09:13,612 --> 02:09:14,433
[SPEAKER_05]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1766
02:09:43,812 --> 02:09:49,078
[SPEAKER_05]: You're good, provided you bought your console before, I believe, September of 2008.

1767
02:09:49,619 --> 02:09:56,766
[SPEAKER_03]: I've actually, I want to say I've heard of this before, and it's because the red rings are covered under Microsoft's warranty, and Best Buy don't want to have anything to do with it anymore.

1768
02:09:57,687 --> 02:09:59,870
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, it looks like I got lucky when mine red ringed.

1769
02:10:00,447 --> 02:10:02,008
[SPEAKER_10]: It's the way you need to do it anyways.

1770
02:10:02,028 --> 02:10:02,809
[SPEAKER_10]: True, but the funny thing is

1771
02:10:28,224 --> 02:10:37,958
[SPEAKER_05]: I used to work for them, and under this coverage, if someone brought the console back, whatever console it was, Best Buy would still get the full credit on it anyway, back from the manufacturer, so...

1772
02:10:38,919 --> 02:10:40,479
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the part that kind of threw me off.

1773
02:10:40,860 --> 02:10:42,000
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe it's an administrative thing.

1774
02:10:42,020 --> 02:10:42,480
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

1775
02:10:43,740 --> 02:10:44,020
[SPEAKER_03]: Strange.

1776
02:10:44,461 --> 02:10:44,741
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1777
02:10:44,781 --> 02:10:47,041
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, Ranma, thank you so much for the call.

1778
02:10:47,221 --> 02:10:49,702
[SPEAKER_03]: And thanks for the heads up on Best Buy.

1779
02:10:49,722 --> 02:10:53,963
[SPEAKER_03]: If folks didn't already know, it's something to think about, especially this holiday season as you're buying people Xboxes.

1780
02:10:53,983 --> 02:11:00,105
[SPEAKER_10]: And also the other thing to think of possibly as a reason why they wouldn't take it back too is they could just say, oh, yeah, Red Ringed.

1781
02:11:00,905 --> 02:11:02,926
[SPEAKER_10]: And in reality, their console got banned.

1782
02:11:04,025 --> 02:11:04,365
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't.

1783
02:11:04,385 --> 02:11:15,210
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, because the thing is, they're supposed to pop open the consoles and test it out and make sure, Red Ring or whatever, because that's what I did when I worked at Geeksville or something and brought back defective PS2s and Xboxes.

1784
02:11:15,250 --> 02:11:20,453
[SPEAKER_05]: When I showed my 360 in the box, they took it, grabbed me another one off the shelf, and I'm like, here you go.

1785
02:11:22,154 --> 02:11:22,854
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was a slow day, too.

1786
02:11:26,491 --> 02:11:26,792
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1787
02:11:27,333 --> 02:11:29,576
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we're going to let you go, Ranma, so we can get some more calls.

1788
02:11:29,716 --> 02:11:30,418
[SPEAKER_03]: But thank you guys.

1789
02:11:30,558 --> 02:11:32,721
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you so much, as always, for calling in, okay?

1790
02:11:33,403 --> 02:11:33,903
[SPEAKER_05]: And upon you.

1791
02:11:34,104 --> 02:11:34,665
[SPEAKER_03]: Have a good week.

1792
02:11:35,326 --> 02:11:35,526
[SPEAKER_08]: You too.

1793
02:11:36,762 --> 02:11:45,506
[SPEAKER_03]: 877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio and that's the place to get in on the Skype line if you have anything you want to talk about tonight on the program.

1794
02:11:46,006 --> 02:11:47,427
[SPEAKER_03]: Other last minute stories we have, Loki?

1795
02:11:47,447 --> 02:11:47,827
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, sure.

1796
02:11:47,967 --> 02:12:02,314
[SPEAKER_10]: There's a PlayStation Network game that's going to be nearly 10 gigabytes in size and it's the PlayStation Network title Record of Argrist War and apparently it's a strategy RPG

1797
02:12:03,894 --> 02:12:08,797
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's coming to North America by Axis Games localization.

1798
02:12:09,117 --> 02:12:19,984
[SPEAKER_10]: One of the companies I said to send the president cat emails to because they localize all sorts of weird stuff, including this game that has apparently anime chicks seductively eating sausages.

1799
02:12:21,324 --> 02:12:22,685
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, joy and rapture.

1800
02:12:23,866 --> 02:12:25,527
[SPEAKER_10]: This picture here.

1801
02:12:25,647 --> 02:12:26,547
[SPEAKER_03]: Too much porn tonight.

1802
02:12:28,469 --> 02:12:28,949
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1803
02:12:29,338 --> 02:12:32,727
[SPEAKER_03]: I know there's no such thing as too much porn, but tonight might be pushing the limit.

1804
02:12:32,987 --> 02:12:33,448
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just saying.

1805
02:12:34,662 --> 02:12:37,123
[SPEAKER_03]: I might have to put the explicit tag on tonight's show for once.

1806
02:12:38,003 --> 02:12:38,844
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyhow, we got another call.

1807
02:12:38,864 --> 02:12:39,884
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1808
02:12:39,904 --> 02:12:40,304
[SPEAKER_03]: Who's this?

1809
02:12:40,905 --> 02:12:41,785
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, this is X-Ling.

1810
02:12:41,805 --> 02:12:43,005
[SPEAKER_03]: You never have too much porn.

1811
02:12:43,025 --> 02:12:44,146
[SPEAKER_03]: What are you talking about?

1812
02:12:44,366 --> 02:12:45,406
[SPEAKER_03]: Clearly, I'm smoking crack.

1813
02:12:45,526 --> 02:12:47,067
[SPEAKER_07]: That means we're Orange Lounge Pornio.

1814
02:12:47,767 --> 02:12:49,808
[SPEAKER_03]: X-Ling, I'm sorry to make you wait there for a little bit, but what's on your mind?

1815
02:12:50,008 --> 02:12:51,029
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, no, no problem.

1816
02:12:51,049 --> 02:12:51,469
[SPEAKER_00]: Not at all.

1817
02:12:51,489 --> 02:12:57,431
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been a great show from everything from snow to boobs to flashlights.

1818
02:12:57,791 --> 02:12:58,972
[SPEAKER_03]: To snow boob flashlights.

1819
02:12:59,032 --> 02:12:59,192
[SPEAKER_03]: I know.

1820
02:12:59,232 --> 02:12:59,492
[SPEAKER_03]: And food.

1821
02:12:59,592 --> 02:13:01,853
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been an amazing night.

1822
02:13:02,133 --> 02:13:03,774
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I found a little bit of information.

1823
02:13:03,834 --> 02:13:04,494
[SPEAKER_00]: It was interesting.

1824
02:13:04,534 --> 02:13:07,375
[SPEAKER_00]: I ran into you about this before, and I told you to look this up.

1825
02:13:07,415 --> 02:13:10,397
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you did or not, but they were talking about Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep.

1826
02:13:10,437 --> 02:13:13,618
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, it's going to be hitting over in Japan on January 9th.

1827
02:13:14,318 --> 02:13:23,522
[SPEAKER_00]: But Jesse McCarthy, on his tweet back about November 30th, put up a tweet and says, Recording yet another Kingdom Hearts game.

1828
02:13:23,662 --> 02:13:25,143
[SPEAKER_00]: All you gamers, eat your heart out.

1829
02:13:25,683 --> 02:13:26,804
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, what a process, though.

1830
02:13:26,864 --> 02:13:28,144
[SPEAKER_00]: The first recording was in 2005 for Game 1.

1831
02:13:30,199 --> 02:13:36,663
[SPEAKER_00]: Which I think they said that actually the first game came out in the US in 2002, which then they said Part 2 came out in 2005.

1832
02:13:36,723 --> 02:13:48,650
[SPEAKER_00]: But nonetheless though, which they're talking about, hopefully that means that we will be getting Birth by Sleep here come sometime maybe either middle of next year or possibly the year after.

1833
02:13:48,730 --> 02:13:50,351
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm definitely looking forward to that.

1834
02:13:50,972 --> 02:13:54,714
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm kind of not surprised that it's making its way over here.

1835
02:13:55,891 --> 02:13:57,072
[SPEAKER_00]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1836
02:14:17,046 --> 02:14:17,466
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's hope.

1837
02:14:17,786 --> 02:14:30,733
[SPEAKER_03]: You know I'm all about the Kingdom Hearts Part 3, but it also makes sense, you know, and I think this point got brought up a couple episodes ago, is that that team has been hard at work on Versus 13, which we've had very little information about, so you know that that game is still heavy under development.

1838
02:14:30,793 --> 02:14:41,238
[SPEAKER_03]: I think once Versus 13 finally looks like it's nearing gold status and it's on its way out, which, honestly, at this point, I don't think is going to happen until 2011, I think we'll have more.

1839
02:14:41,578 --> 02:14:42,439
[SPEAKER_03]: Because, you know, I think...

1840
02:14:42,919 --> 02:14:43,659
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's my thought, actually.

1841
02:14:43,779 --> 02:14:47,901
[SPEAKER_03]: Versus XIII, I think is going to be a big thing at E3 2010 for Square.

1842
02:14:48,201 --> 02:14:52,563
[SPEAKER_03]: Because at that point, Final Fantasy XIII, non-Versus, the regular one, will be out.

1843
02:14:53,263 --> 02:14:57,465
[SPEAKER_03]: Now that we know the release date for XIII, it'll be out in Japan, it'll be out here in the US.

1844
02:14:57,785 --> 02:14:58,565
[SPEAKER_03]: That's done now.

1845
02:14:58,925 --> 02:15:00,906
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think Versus XIII will be big.

1846
02:15:01,086 --> 02:15:03,027
[SPEAKER_03]: And maybe they'll make a Kingdom Hearts announcement?

1847
02:15:03,627 --> 02:15:08,931
[SPEAKER_03]: but I think that's what's going to be their big thing at E3 this year.

1848
02:15:08,951 --> 02:15:10,513
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry.

1849
02:15:10,953 --> 02:15:27,126
[SPEAKER_00]: My prediction would be that the Kingdom Hearts and also they've been showing teasers especially over in Japan for it but the Parasite Eve the third birthday was also been teased over in Japan which of course did very well.

1850
02:15:27,186 --> 02:15:29,648
[SPEAKER_00]: The first two did very well over here I believe in the US.

1851
02:15:29,688 --> 02:15:31,850
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, surprising they never did a third one.

1852
02:15:32,432 --> 02:15:33,352
[SPEAKER_00]: I still wish they'd translate the book.

1853
02:15:33,373 --> 02:15:33,933
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember Parasite Eve.

1854
02:15:33,953 --> 02:15:36,114
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember a story that we covered on the show.

1855
02:15:36,214 --> 02:15:40,136
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a while ago, probably about a year and a half ago, but I remember this has come up on the show before.

1856
02:15:40,156 --> 02:15:40,817
[SPEAKER_00]: It's being done.

1857
02:15:40,877 --> 02:15:42,958
[SPEAKER_00]: I seem to recall it was on the PSP, too.

1858
02:16:00,347 --> 02:16:08,830
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's a little weird that that's the direction they're going with it when they could do something, you know, epic on the PS3, but, you know, whatever, or 360, whatever they want to do.

1859
02:16:08,850 --> 02:16:13,532
[SPEAKER_03]: I imagine that's something they're going to pull out of their hat at E3.

1860
02:16:13,752 --> 02:16:14,432
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd be with you there.

1861
02:16:15,353 --> 02:16:16,893
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just surprised to see what they will do.

1862
02:16:17,233 --> 02:16:20,875
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, they're just going to try to, you know, go for it, you know, so if they do, that's great.

1863
02:16:20,935 --> 02:16:21,415
[SPEAKER_00]: If not, then...

1864
02:16:23,479 --> 02:16:24,661
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, well, excellent.

1865
02:16:24,681 --> 02:16:30,052
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you so much for the call, and we're going to let you go so we can wrap up the show, but thank you so much as always, and have a good night, okay?

1866
02:16:30,393 --> 02:16:30,974
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, thanks.

1867
02:16:31,074 --> 02:16:31,335
[SPEAKER_03]: Later.

1868
02:16:31,896 --> 02:16:32,056
[SPEAKER_03]: Later.

1869
02:16:33,035 --> 02:16:34,576
[SPEAKER_03]: That's going to do it for tonight's Skype line.

1870
02:16:34,616 --> 02:16:35,997
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you so much to our callers tonight.

1871
02:16:36,017 --> 02:16:36,817
[SPEAKER_03]: We really appreciate it.

1872
02:16:36,857 --> 02:16:38,498
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry to those folks that didn't get through tonight.

1873
02:16:38,919 --> 02:16:40,519
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's weird.

1874
02:16:40,559 --> 02:16:42,401
[SPEAKER_03]: Tonight's show's been moving very fast.

1875
02:16:43,381 --> 02:16:45,963
[SPEAKER_03]: We're actually probably going to end a little bit earlier than usual.

1876
02:16:45,983 --> 02:16:46,503
[SPEAKER_03]: But you know what?

1877
02:16:46,543 --> 02:16:48,724
[SPEAKER_03]: It's also that time of year where the games are out now.

1878
02:16:49,285 --> 02:16:53,227
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's not a whole lot of, you know, people are going to be sleeping through December.

1879
02:16:53,287 --> 02:16:57,069
[SPEAKER_03]: And we'll get more game news come January, especially with all of these postponements.

1880
02:16:57,489 --> 02:17:00,431
[SPEAKER_03]: I think first and second quarter 2010 are going to be very interesting.

1881
02:17:00,691 --> 02:17:01,732
[SPEAKER_03]: First quarter's pretty interesting.

1882
02:17:01,932 --> 02:17:04,373
[SPEAKER_03]: All these games that got delayed are finally going to come out.

1883
02:17:04,393 --> 02:17:05,593
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be very interesting.

1884
02:17:06,053 --> 02:17:07,874
[SPEAKER_03]: But anyhow, we saw some last-minute stories, right, Loki?

1885
02:17:08,374 --> 02:17:09,555
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

1886
02:17:09,775 --> 02:17:19,038
[SPEAKER_10]: And then other than Mirror's Edge, there's also some other decent games coming to the iPhone, including the iPhone version of Ace Combat 11.

1887
02:17:20,962 --> 02:17:22,143
[SPEAKER_10]: or XI, I guess.

1888
02:17:23,923 --> 02:17:25,864
[SPEAKER_10]: That's coming from Namco, of course.

1889
02:17:26,024 --> 02:17:27,145
[SPEAKER_10]: It looks pretty awesome.

1890
02:17:27,765 --> 02:17:35,469
[SPEAKER_10]: And they're also updating, I guess, Garters and Ghouls in relation to Ghosts and Goblins.

1891
02:17:35,529 --> 02:17:37,090
[SPEAKER_03]: I was going to say, that's what it sounds like.

1892
02:17:37,110 --> 02:17:38,310
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that like Ghosts and Goblins?

1893
02:17:38,430 --> 02:17:40,712
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a zombie killing game.

1894
02:17:41,152 --> 02:17:47,835
[SPEAKER_10]: And it allows you, they're going to have GPS support in it now, so you can move your iPhone around to turn your player in the game.

1895
02:17:48,283 --> 02:17:51,145
[SPEAKER_03]: Actdeft wants to point out that's Ace Combat She, not Eleven.

1896
02:17:51,265 --> 02:17:51,506
[SPEAKER_03]: She.

1897
02:17:51,706 --> 02:17:55,929
[SPEAKER_03]: Because Ace Combat 6 was the last one, so you wouldn't jump right to Eleven.

1898
02:17:56,290 --> 02:17:58,131
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, but you never... Okay, so She.

1899
02:17:58,772 --> 02:18:00,012
[SPEAKER_10]: And let's see, what else?

1900
02:18:00,033 --> 02:18:04,176
[SPEAKER_10]: So Sirius Sam, the second encounter, is also getting the HD treatment as well.

1901
02:18:04,436 --> 02:18:09,200
[SPEAKER_10]: And if I remember correctly, the first one still hasn't come out yet, but, you know...

1902
02:18:10,060 --> 02:18:10,561
[SPEAKER_10]: XBOX Live Arcade

1903
02:18:26,209 --> 02:18:34,453
[SPEAKER_10]: Lips Party Classics will be coming out on the Xbox 360 in 2010, apparently in the spring.

1904
02:18:34,533 --> 02:18:54,804
[SPEAKER_10]: It will feature 40 new tracks, including The Love Shack by the B-52s, Tub Thumping by Chubba Wumba, I Will Survive by Gloria Gaynor, Rock and Roll All Night by KISS, Wannabe by Spice Girls, I Think We're Alone Now by Tiffany, and YMCA by The Village People.

1905
02:18:55,664 --> 02:19:02,506
[SPEAKER_10]: and of course, you know, your typical karaoke game.

1906
02:19:03,327 --> 02:19:13,750
[SPEAKER_10]: And then finally, to kind of elaborate a little bit more on what the Record of Argus War was, that's a game that had that soul breed function in there.

1907
02:19:13,810 --> 02:19:19,072
[SPEAKER_10]: Basically, you find these women and you breed with them to create a new hero.

1908
02:19:19,092 --> 02:19:21,953
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

1909
02:19:21,973 --> 02:19:22,053
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

1910
02:19:22,987 --> 02:19:23,267
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura

1911
02:19:52,520 --> 02:19:53,440
[SPEAKER_03]: Your final thought tonight?

1912
02:19:53,880 --> 02:19:54,600
[SPEAKER_06]: My hands hurt.

1913
02:19:55,081 --> 02:19:55,641
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry to hear that.

1914
02:19:55,721 --> 02:19:56,141
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki.

1915
02:19:57,461 --> 02:19:58,321
[SPEAKER_10]: My hands don't hurt.

1916
02:20:00,502 --> 02:20:02,382
[SPEAKER_03]: My final thought is I want a taco.

1917
02:20:02,962 --> 02:20:03,683
[SPEAKER_03]: That's my final thought.

1918
02:20:03,723 --> 02:20:06,503
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that was my final thought last week, but I again want a taco, just so you know.

1919
02:20:07,183 --> 02:20:09,224
[SPEAKER_03]: That's going to do it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

1920
02:20:09,284 --> 02:20:10,404
[SPEAKER_03]: Believe it or not, we're coming to a close.

1921
02:20:10,424 --> 02:20:13,245
[SPEAKER_03]: I know it's a little early tonight, but like I said, it's a little bit of a slower news week.

1922
02:20:13,605 --> 02:20:14,985
[SPEAKER_03]: Not as much to discuss as usual.

1923
02:20:15,505 --> 02:20:18,506
[SPEAKER_03]: Live listeners, though, stay tuned because we have a little extra something after the show as usual.

1924
02:20:18,906 --> 02:20:47,997
[SPEAKER_03]: for those of you guys listening on the podcast though that's going to do it thank you guys so much for downloading and supporting our program we really appreciate it again all we ask you know we do this stuff for free so please tell two people about the show I know especially ever since the launch of the Facebook page a lot of you guys have really been selling the show to your friends we really appreciate that and the word of mouth goes a very long way and you know just want to let you guys know it's really appreciated because we don't really have advertising dollars we don't have a big magazine supporting us you know we're not on TV or anything fancy like that so word of mouth is all we got

1925
02:20:48,337 --> 02:20:49,258
[SPEAKER_03]: So we really appreciate it.

1926
02:20:49,678 --> 02:20:51,960
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you didn't like our program, that's okay.

1927
02:20:52,340 --> 02:20:53,180
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't hate you that much.

1928
02:20:53,521 --> 02:20:58,324
[SPEAKER_03]: But do check out some of the other programs on allgames.com, some other great independent podcasts that talk about other things.

1929
02:20:58,464 --> 02:21:06,750
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, if you don't like us because we don't talk enough modern warfare, there's a show on there that talks much more about first-person shooters or whatever might be up your alley.

1930
02:21:07,230 --> 02:21:08,891
[SPEAKER_03]: So thank you guys, of course, as always.

1931
02:21:09,331 --> 02:21:10,893
[SPEAKER_03]: And we'll do it all again next week.

1932
02:21:11,253 --> 02:21:15,496
[SPEAKER_03]: Except remember, guys, next week, sadly, not live, but it will be pre-taped.

1933
02:21:16,056 --> 02:21:20,642
[SPEAKER_03]: If we can pre-tape it live, stay tuned to the Twitter and the Facebook for all that information.

1934
02:21:21,563 --> 02:21:24,006
[SPEAKER_03]: Meanwhile, that's going to do it for another edition of Orange Lounge Radio.

1935
02:21:24,727 --> 02:21:25,368
[SPEAKER_03]: Until next week.

1936
02:21:26,389 --> 02:21:31,131
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm Rob Roberts, she's DarkSakura, he's Loki, and we're out.

1937
02:21:48,078 --> 02:21:50,581
[SPEAKER_04]: or allgames.com but we're probably right anyway see you next week
