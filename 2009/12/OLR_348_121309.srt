Orange Lounge Radio

00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:13,000
We're your hosts, DarkSakura, Sky and Loco.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Tonight, December 13th, 2009, a retro-tastic Mega Man 10 is announced, LittleBigPlanet is about to get Captain Sackboy, and what famous video game has been adapted for the stage?

Orange Lounge Radio

5
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio. We are that program dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.

6
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Of course, we tape live every Sunday night at All Games Radio, www.allgames.com, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show, except this week. This week is kind of special. It's very special right now actually.

7
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:04,000
We're on take two of trying to tape live on Saturday. We're actually live the day before, and if you want to know why things are all kind of awkward this week, well, you can blame Lady Gaga. It's all Lady Gaga's fault.

8
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:16,000
No, I know people like to blame her for a lot of things, but I'm going to the concert in San Francisco tomorrow night, as mentioned a couple weeks back, and so it just works out because the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers, is here.

9
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Hi.

10
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
And I think she said something about a pinball party that she's going to.

11
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
It's Dan's turn to host the pinball party.

12
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I see.

13
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
So we'll be probably running away from it tomorrow night to go probably watch Star Trek with Becky.

14
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I see.

15
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
We'll have a special guest next week though.

16
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
So it just seems to work out. Really, we have a special guest next week? Who's that? Who dat?

17
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I'm wondering if I should spoil the surprise.

18
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Oh, okay.

19
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
We are going to have Tiara.

20
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Really? Is she going to be here next week?

21
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Yes.

22
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I'm very excited.

23
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
So am I.

24
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Awesome, awesome. Also joining us tonight, say hello to the one and only tech master, Loki.

25
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Hello.

26
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
How you doing, Loki?

27
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Doing fine.

28
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Our chat room, chat.orangelaungeradio.com, if you want to join us.

29
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Now, we're going to get into our gaming weeks pretty soon here.

30
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:10,000
But before we do that, I want to ask Loki, what the heck is this thing that you brought with you to the studio tonight?

31
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
It looks like kind of like a Game Boy Advance, like one of the mini ones they release later on, but it's a little bit bigger actually.

32
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
No, it's cooler than Game Boy Micro.

33
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:23,000
It's a Dingo Digital A320, also I think called like a Game King or something like that.

34
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Of course, made in China.

35
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:30,000
And what it is, is it's a device that only runs emulators.

36
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Well, emulators and I guess different homebrew applications.

37
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I think it's based off Linux.

38
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:44,000
But you can actually run, you know, different emulators including CPS 1 and 2, which are the Capcom arcade games.

39
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
MVS, which is the Neo Geo arcade games.

40
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
NES, I want to say Mega Drive.

41
00:02:51,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I think Game Boy Advance, those are all the default emulators that are actually in the system itself, but you can load more stuff on later on.

42
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
I was going to say it doesn't look like an Australian canine.

43
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
It doesn't look like it ate a baby either.

44
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
It did not eat a baby.

45
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
You can also tune in radio on it.

46
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Can you listen to Orange Lounge Radio?

47
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
You can listen to podcasts because it plays MP3.

48
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
And it has Linux?

49
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I think it's based off Linux. I'm not positive.

50
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Actually, no. It's not based off Linux. You can install Linux on it.

51
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I'm sure someone's put Linux on it.

52
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
If they can install Linux on a freaking toaster oven, they can install Linux on that thing.

53
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
You can install Linux on it. It's actually not based on Linux.

54
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:37,000
I thought it may have been because I know that GP2X, it's another homebrew device, you can do that.

55
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
And it also outputs the TV, so that's kind of cool.

56
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
That's pretty cool. Now how much did one of those suckers cost you?

57
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Eighty bucks.

58
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Wow, that's not bad. And where did you get it from?

59
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:45,000
eBay.

60
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Okay.

61
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Who makes them?

62
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I don't remember the company's name.

63
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Does it come from another country? Surely the legality of those things is questionable.

64
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Well, there you go. All the good piracy stuff comes from China.

65
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:05,000
It's kind of cool though. It charges via USB. It takes mini SD cards, so I actually don't have a card for it.

66
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
But it has four gigs of internal memory you can store crap to, so that's kind of cool.

67
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
And you can put themes on it. In fact, I have a Legend of Zelda theme on mine.

68
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Which, it's hard to see, Rob, but you'll have to take a look at it.

69
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Alright, I'm looking at the, this is great radio, by the way.

70
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Oh, okay. It kind of has like a crossbar thing going on, like a PSP.

71
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Yeah, it's got like a crossbar thing going on there.

72
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
That's cool. I like that. That's pretty neat.

73
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
And Jamie is super gluing her fingers together, apparently.

74
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
What the hell is she doing over there? Is she doing arts and crafts during the show?

75
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Like, I know last week she was crocheting. Now she's gluing.

76
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Oh, and I forgot. The other thing you can do, it has a built-in microphone, so you can actually do dictation or whatever, record yourself.

77
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
That's kind of interesting. Alright, well.

78
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
There you go.

79
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Hey guys, if you are listening to us live on this Saturday, you can join us in our chat room.

80
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
chat.orangeloungeradio.com is the place to be.

81
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Or if you're on the Game Surge Network on IRC, you just want to join Channel Pound Orange Lounge.

82
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
All one word, and that is our chat room.

83
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
We do use a different room than the all-games chatters.

84
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,000
I don't know why, we just always have. It's a history thing at this point.

85
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Kind of tradition, I guess you could say.

86
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Anyhow, we are going to get into How Was Your Gaming Week, somewhat shortly here.

87
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:21,000
If you're listening to us on Sunday, sorry that you're not able to interact with us live this week, but we will be back on Sunday the 19th.

88
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,000
That should be an interesting show, by the way, because I'm going to be running back from Disneyland that morning.

89
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
So I'm going to run right in here.

90
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
I'm going to need you to do the show next week, Loki. Just so you know.

91
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Alright, super. Alright, anyhow.

92
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Now that we're taking care of business live on air, let's get into our gaming weeks.

93
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
And if DarkSakura has unglued her fingers, I'm going to ask her how her gaming week was.

94
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
No, I've got glue all over my fingers still. I was fixing, my cell phone case broke.

95
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:53,000
And the little thing that clips it to my belt snapped off, so I just super glued it back on.

96
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Because rubber cement clearly isn't working.

97
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:01,000
And now I've just super glued my fingers, so I'm going to have to go run and use some nail polish remover on them.

98
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
What about gaming?

99
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
I glued soap to my fingers.

100
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Apparently she's too busy gluing her fingers together to play games.

101
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:13,000
So I played some World of Warcraft yesterday for like an hour.

102
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
You've got to level 10 now, huh?

103
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
I have a second character at 10 now. I have a character at 15.

104
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Moving on up.

105
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:25,000
My goat girl.

106
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
She's a mage.

107
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
So now you get to spend talent points at 15. So are you fire, frost, or arcane?

108
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
No idea. Probably going to be fire because I like burning shit.

109
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Yeah, fire's fun.

110
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:41,000
I'm also playing a hunter every so often. I play with Tiara.

111
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:47,000
And then I'm actually playing on another server just because people ask me to.

112
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I'm playing a dark elf druid.

113
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Dark elf? When did I say dark elf? It's not fucking D&D.

114
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
No, night elf.

115
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
It's okay. WoW ripped a lot off from D&D, so it works.

116
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Now I'm going to go pour acetone on my fingers.

117
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Alright, have fun.

118
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Loki, how was your gaming week besides the dingo?

119
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Besides the dingo? I actually played on my arcade cabinet a little bit because I finally got...

120
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
It's almost done. The front end's working now.

121
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:20,000
The problem is I have too many games listed on there because I have every single game that's been pretty much ever put on MAME on that cabinet.

122
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:27,000
It makes it really hard to find stuff, so I have to go back now and remove stuff off the list that I don't really want to play.

123
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
And that's going to be a process in itself.

124
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Yeah, fun.

125
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:37,000
But I did play a little bit of... What did I play on there? I was testing it out.

126
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Oh, just some random Neo Geo games and stuff. It works really well.

127
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:50,000
And then I've been playing Bayonetta. I finally broke out my Japanese 360 and that game is all sorts of awesome.

128
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Totally reiterating what Rob said last week about the game. It's so over the top. Every single bit is over the top.

129
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:07,000
One of the main characters in the game gives Bayonetta some new guns because in the very beginning it's just these stupid little pistols or whatever.

130
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:15,000
But I love it because it's not quality, it's quantity and he starts throwing tons of pistols at her and it's just absolutely ridiculous.

131
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Wait, is it dubbed in English?

132
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
It's all in English. The entire game is in English.

133
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:27,000
So you didn't play... I just played the demo, which was a selected stage from the game apparently, but you actually have the full Japanese one.

134
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Yeah, I have the full game. It's absolutely all in English.

135
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:35,000
So it's just ridiculous.

136
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Have you done the trick where she gets on the ground and starts shooting people with her feet with the guns in her heels?

137
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Yeah.

138
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:48,000
You can do that or like the one where it zooms around her really fast and stuff, shooting different things. That's crazy.

139
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:55,000
But they also have these mini games or whatever. You earn these coins or whatever and they have a shooting gallery mini game that you earn items and stuff.

140
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:01,000
It's in between levels. I love the Joe Pesci type character. It's Joe Pesci but not Joe Pesci.

141
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
My favorite character in the game.

142
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Just everything about the game is so over the top though. Seriously, it gives her new red pistols or whatever that are in the game.

143
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:25,000
And there's this sequence where the guy's mixing a drink and she's putting on the pistols in the most ridiculous over the top choreographed scene I've ever seen.

144
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,000
It's just really out there, but it's awesome.

145
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,000
This is definitely my most anticipated game of 2010, no question. This is going to be amazing.

146
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
I kind of want to come over and play the one that you have.

147
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:44,000
It wasn't even really on my radar, but man, after picking up and playing it, and I hate Devil May Cry. I hate it.

148
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
But this game is awesome.

149
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:53,000
This is totally one of those games I never thought I would like. Just looking at screenshots where you don't really see the game in motion.

150
00:09:54,000 --> 00:10:03,000
I have a proposal for you then. Sometime in the next weeks or so, you should totally just bring it over and the three of us should just play through it.

151
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Maybe tape it or something.

152
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
I have it in my car.

153
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Do you really?

154
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Yeah, I have it in my car. In fact, I have to order Pizza Hut pasta after the show, and since we're going to be wrapped up sooner than I thought.

155
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
We have to be done before 5 Pacific because I think the next All Games program is at 5.

156
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,000
So since we're going to be done before what I thought, we might have a chance to play it for a few minutes.

157
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Hey, hey, alright. Might be something we do after the show. Too bad I don't have my video camera. Oh well, we'll figure something out.

158
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:37,000
That's alright. I'm trying to think of what else I play this week also. Still no Borderlands yet, but I'm hoping to break into that tomorrow night.

159
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Unfortunately I got distracted by Bayonetta. And then of course more Grand Theft Auto because that's what we play every day.

160
00:10:44,000 --> 00:11:01,000
It's really sad though, there's not a lot of people online playing Grand Theft Auto, at least not the Ballad of the Gay Tony multiplayer, man. There's times where we'll be playing ranked matches where we can't get more than 4 people in, and those 4 people are us.

161
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:09,000
It's so slow that we can get into the same ranked game easy now, but I don't know.

162
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Talk to Dan at some point, because while he's off work I'm sure he'll play with you guys.

163
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Sure. Alright, moving into my gaming week then. Not a whole lot of new stuff. I'm also trying to think of anything new I played this week and I'm drawing a blank, but just celebrating some old stuff.

164
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:34,000
In fact, one big thing I did this week that I will talk about is that you might have heard around the internet that there was a big fundraiser for Child's Play in the Bay Area.

165
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:42,000
In fact, we had SEG, one of the organizers on the show a couple weeks ago, UMLOUD, happen this Wednesday, and I actually trekked out over to the Bay Area to check it out.

166
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:50,000
It was cool. It was a fun little event. It wasn't super crowded, but it definitely wasn't a bad turnout.

167
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:57,000
It was tolerable, the amount of people in what is a much smaller club than you'd probably think if you're looking at some of those videos online of some of the bands.

168
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Of course, the whole catch was that people would pay money to get up on stage and play rock band in a karaoke bar gone wild thing.

169
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:13,000
They had fog machines, professional lighting, and everything. They went out. They treated this like it was a normal concert for these bands that paid.

170
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:22,000
I think the ultimate band was $120 to get on stage, but it's a great, great charity, so it's kind of hard to say no to something like that.

171
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:27,000
In fact, I wanted to do it. I just didn't have, with Jamie and Loki not being able to go, I just didn't have enough people to do the band.

172
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
I completely forgot about it until I saw the tweet on it.

173
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
That was today, wasn't it?

174
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
That's alright. We still wouldn't have had enough people.

175
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Some of the bands just really went all out, and you probably saw some of the pictures around the internet.

176
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:46,000
There was one band that had this chick dressed in blue that was wearing this outfit that was really over the top and awesome.

177
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:52,000
They had a band come out that was dressed up like Lego rock band. They actually had yellow buckets on their heads, and they put the little thingies.

178
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:57,000
You know how Lego has that little nub on the top of it? They actually had those as buckets and sang.

179
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
There's all these videos around the internet, and it was great.

180
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:06,000
I had a good time. I ran into some friends I haven't seen in a long time. A couple of my friends from high school were randomly there.

181
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:13,000
People from the DDR scene years ago that used to come on this program years and years ago, and we were exclusively about music games.

182
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Like Wendell and Islander and some of these people that were big into freestyle and Perfect Attack and stuff were there, randomly.

183
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Wendell had a band with his, I think it was his sister or niece and her friends or something. It was fun.

184
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
I think it was easy to do freestyle with them, too.

185
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Yeah, it was cool.

186
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:39,000
They didn't have a lot set up as far as games because you just had the stage, which you had to pay to be on.

187
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Or in the back, they had Beatles Rock Band, which actually had the new content.

188
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:49,000
But they had a lot of support from Harmonix. They had tons and tons of just loot.

189
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:56,000
You pay $10 to get in the door, which technically you don't have to do because it's a $10 suggested donation.

190
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,000
But since the whole thing is charity, if you don't pay $10, you're kind of a douche.

191
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Unless you're a starving student or whatever, you know, the economy.

192
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Then you don't need to go outside and you need to be studying.

193
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:11,000
But, you know, obviously I'm sure everybody paid their fair share, if not more, to get in.

194
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
And it all worked out to about $10 a person.

195
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
They actually gave you a little ticket.

196
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Well, they gave you raffle tickets, which sadly we weren't able to stay long enough to get all the raffles.

197
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
So I don't know if we ever would have won the raffles. I don't think so.

198
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
But you also got a ticket to go to a loot table.

199
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
And it's like you got one free gift.

200
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:31,000
And they had all sorts of just random shit on these loot tables.

201
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Like PlayStation 1 games, Super Nintendo games I saw on there, like a calendar for Bayonetta I was looking at.

202
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Like a lot of those promo type things you would see at E3, like the types of E3 swag, all like dumped out on the table.

203
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:51,000
So I walked out of there with a plug and play Intellivision Part 2.

204
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
It's a little controller.

205
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:58,000
The second one they've released apparently with 10 Intellivision games I guarantee you've never heard of.

206
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Well, except Jamie because she's crazy.

207
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Yeah, I know.

208
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
But I walked out of there with that.

209
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:09,000
My friend who I went with, Alan, he walked out of there with a copy of Advance Force 2 for Game Boy Advance.

210
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,000
So just all this cool stuff on the loot table, it was kind of rad.

211
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
It was all donated to a great cause.

212
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:22,000
And then they had a silent auction going on, which I know they gave away a very limited edition,

213
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:29,000
signed like a Space Invaders thing of which I think only 180 exist.

214
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,000
I think that thing went for like several thousand dollars.

215
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
They gave away like a stuffed thing from Lost Planet.

216
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
I won one of the silent auctions.

217
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,000
I don't want to talk about it on the show because part of it's going to be a Christmas present for someone

218
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,000
and even though I don't think they listen, I just don't want to talk about it on the show.

219
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,000
And if you figure it out, please don't spread word out because it's somebody's Christmas present.

220
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
But I did win one of the auctions.

221
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
And you know what's funny?

222
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Have you ever had the experience of reading on the internet on a forum,

223
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
like someone talking smack about you when they didn't know who you were?

224
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Have you ever had that happen?

225
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Like you read this story and someone's talking smack about a person they saw somewhere and it was you?

226
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
All the time.

227
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Like I had that happen, okay?

228
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:16,000
And it's funny because Dark Tetsuya on our Twitter linked me to this story on Kotaku about Um Loud and kind of a wrap up.

229
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:20,000
And in the comments, get this, this guy named S.H. Dragon left a comment.

230
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Other fun things.

231
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:27,000
I lost the blank auction because the guy I was bid warring against was camping the clipboard.

232
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Boo. I can't believe that went for only $100.

233
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Oh well, I didn't really have the money to spend anyway.

234
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
It's just kind of funny.

235
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
First off, I wasn't camping the clipboard.

236
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
We just happened to be sitting in that back corner right by where the silent auction was,

237
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
me and Alan and a couple of guys.

238
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:47,000
But I will admit, yeah, I was going to go up there at 1029 and make sure I was the highest bidder come 1030, of course.

239
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Call it what you will.

240
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
It just means that you didn't really want it as badly as...

241
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Yes, that's right, that's right.

242
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
It just means dude didn't want it as bad as I did.

243
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,000
And it worked out and actually I got it for $90, not $100.

244
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
And really it was a steal.

245
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:07,000
It was absolutely a steal and it should have gone for much more, especially for such a good cause.

246
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,000
However, $100 was about the most I was going to spend on this.

247
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Because even though it's for a good cause, look, I got to live too and got money and everything.

248
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,000
So that was probably about the most I was going to bid on it.

249
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
And I'm in turn giving half of it to somebody else.

250
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,000
And I'll explain more about what that is after it gets given to the individual.

251
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
So yeah, that was my experience at UmLoud.

252
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Overall, very good.

253
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
I wish I could have stayed for more of it.

254
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
I wish I could have got up on stage.

255
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Next year. I have heard it is confirmed again for next year.

256
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
I'm not sure if it's the same venue or what have you.

257
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:43,000
But honestly, if you guys haven't already or didn't go this year,

258
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
and I didn't really run into a lot of OLR listeners,

259
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
definitely make plans to go next year because it was quite a bit of fun.

260
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
That's pretty much it for my gaming week.

261
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
I didn't play a whole lot of video games I haven't talked about on the show before otherwise.

262
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
DJ Hero, I played some more of this week.

263
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
I played that track pack, the David Guetta track pack.

264
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
I haven't played that yet. I downloaded it.

265
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Sexy Bitch, or no, it's Sexy Chick, I think they renamed it.

266
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,000
And When Love Takes Over, which is weird because that's download pack.

267
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,000
The songs aren't mixed. It's just the one song, but they're like remixes of the song.

268
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:17,000
I'm sure that are available on a remix CD somewhere, I'm sure, or vinyl.

269
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,000
But it was cool. One of them has a crap ton of crossfading in it.

270
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
And I have to admit, I actually kind of like the songs.

271
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
So even though one of them had Dudes for the Black Eyed Peas,

272
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
which usually is one of those bands you're like,

273
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
they're so played out.

274
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:35,000
If I hear that goddamn song at the club one more time, I gotta feel it.

275
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Like, oh my god, if I hear that at the club one more time, I'm gonna poke my eye out.

276
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
But I gotta admit, that one song is pretty cool.

277
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Do it on camera so we can put it on YouTube.

278
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Yeah, fine.

279
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Anyhow, let's get into some housekeeping real quick.

280
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Again, we're pre-taping. If you're just joining us on All Games Radio on Saturday,

281
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
that's because we're pre-taping, or pre-recording, whatever you want to call it.

282
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,000
We're doing a pre-thing for our Sunday, the 13th.

283
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
This will rebroadcast again on Sunday.

284
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
If you're listening live on Sunday, sorry we are not live,

285
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
but we do hope you'll send us an email or a tweet or something

286
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
to tell us what you thought about tonight's show.

287
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
And of course, the podcasters, well, you're used to getting this on the feed anyway.

288
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Also, join our Facebook at facebook.com slash orange lounge radio,

289
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
or our Twitter, twitter.com slash o-l-r.

290
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
We always post little updates, especially if there is gonna be weird things

291
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,000
like pre-recorded shows and all that stuff going on.

292
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
All right, gaming news.

293
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Believe it or not, even though we're only a couple weeks out before Christmas,

294
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
there's been quite a little bit of it, so let's get into some gaming news.

295
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Oh, Loki. Loki wants to do this during housekeeping tonight.

296
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Just real quick.

297
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
All right, Loki has brought Christmas presents, or Hanukkah presents,

298
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
I suppose, if you will, at an appropriate time.

299
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
I had to bring him over because the cat was starting to eye him up

300
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
because she likes ribbons and paper and stuff,

301
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
and she'll start ripping into it.

302
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
And don't I feel like a douchebag because Loki's brought this so early

303
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
and I don't have his present here.

304
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
I don't do my shopping until Christmas Eve.

305
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
I do my shopping all this week.

306
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
I do my shopping afterwards so I get it all on sale.

307
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Ladies first, Dark Sakura, you can open your gift.

308
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
This is great radio.

309
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Surely the wife must have done this.

310
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
The wife did the wrapping.

311
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
There's no way Loki did this wrapping himself.

312
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
I did no wrapping of that.

313
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Going to our chatroom at chat.orangelandradi.com,

314
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,000
ToaGak says, if you ever lose an episode of OLR,

315
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
I'm archiving the live editions for you.

316
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
What did you get?

317
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Return to Labyrinth manga. That's awesome.

318
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:31,000
Sweet.

319
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Oh my god, that's super cool.

320
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:34,000
I'm gonna read the hell out of this.

321
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:35,000
That's great.

322
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
And dude, it's like...

323
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
You gotta open the big one first.

324
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,000
I gotta open the big one first before the little one.

325
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Okay, you got it. So I'm gonna open the big one first.

326
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,000
This is a big...

327
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
What a big package you have, Loki.

328
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
That's your package, Rob.

329
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
Oh, sorry. Well, you gave me your package.

330
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
FC... Oh my god.

331
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Oh, what a cool...

332
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Oh my god, rad!

333
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Dude, it's an FC Mobile.

334
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Yes!

335
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Oh, Loki, you're the best. That's awesome.

336
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Look at that. It's like a portable Nintendo.

337
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Those are fun.

338
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
You have one of these too, right?

339
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Yes, I do.

340
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,000
Oh my god, awesome.

341
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
You can plug it into your TV and the light gun's a wireless light gun.

342
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Yeah, the controllers are wireless and the light gun's wireless.

343
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Holy fucking crap, I'm so excited.

344
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Dude, I'm gonna play this right away.

345
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Oh my god, this must be a game over here in the gold.

346
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
And I got you batteries.

347
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Oh, sweet, okay. Cool, cool.

348
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
I didn't wrap the batteries.

349
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
I can only guess what game this is.

350
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:40,000
I bet you could.

351
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Fuck yeah, Guardian Legend, motherfucker!

352
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
There you go, batteries.

353
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
Oh my god, awesome.

354
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Hold on, this is great right here.

355
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Awesome, Loki, you're the best.

356
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Take the Guardian Legends wherever you go.

357
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Darkstalkers gonna put these on the website or on the Twitter?

358
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
On the website.

359
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Batteries fell, but here you go.

360
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
Taking a picture live there.

361
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
There's my FC Mobile and copy of Guardian Legend.

362
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Did you get that?

363
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Yep.

364
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Alright, cool. Very cool.

365
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,000
I'm taking a picture of my mom.

366
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Kitsune's asking, where's our presents?

367
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Dude, I'm not that rich.

368
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
I can't buy everybody gifts.

369
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
We've been taping this show for free for the past seven years.

370
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,000
We don't run ads or nothing.

371
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
I didn't even know these came out, so this is like super cool.

372
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
That's awesome.

373
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
I don't even know how I found those.

374
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
I don't even remember what I was looking for,

375
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000
but I somehow came across them like, hey.

376
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,000
No, yeah. Oh my god, if I had found those, I would have bought a fort too.

377
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
You remember what the movie's called?

378
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
It's, you know, Labyrinth guest star David Bowie's package.

379
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
And I'm sorry, this is prettier than David Bowie has ever been,

380
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
and David Bowie is pretty.

381
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
Alright. Well, now that I'm in a super duper happy mood,

382
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,000
part of me wants to turn this on during the break or something.

383
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,000
I want to get this up and going.

384
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
Dude, FC Mobile, yeah.

385
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
I'm gonna go out and buy NES games like crazy.

386
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:01,000
Anyhow, now, this, I can support portable gaming with this.

387
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Do you really?

388
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
I can support portable games with this.

389
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
The hell with the DS and the PSP.

390
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,000
I got an FC Mobile, y'all.

391
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Alright, getting into some gaming news tonight.

392
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Loki, start us off.

393
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
So you may remember that a little bit ago, no doubt,

394
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:20,000
and I believe Courtney Love tried suing Activision for the likenesses

395
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:26,000
of Kurt Cobain and, of course, No Doubt in Band Hero more recently.

396
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:34,000
However, Activision has responded to No Doubt's claim by counter-suing them.

397
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:38,000
Basically, they're made in responses that the band requests

398
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:44,000
that their likenesses be limited to performing only the band's own songs in game

399
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:50,000
was made, however, it was requested only after the band hero programming was finalized.

400
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:57,000
Activision is basically seeking an unspecified amount for damages and interest from the band,

401
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:02,000
as well as court and attorney fees and return of all payment dispersed to the band for their involvement.

402
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:07,000
So basically, they want their money back for their involvement in the game.

403
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:13,000
This is a gigantic bitch-slap to one of the biggest bands of the last few years.

404
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:18,000
For me, I think this is kind of retarded that Activision is doing.

405
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
I mean, I understand that they had an agreement in place,

406
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:25,000
and apparently somebody didn't read the contract close enough or whatever,

407
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:30,000
and so they want their money back, or they want the patch to this game,

408
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:35,000
but they can't, at least they can on Wii and PlayStation 2 and that kind of stuff.

409
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:44,000
But at the same time, now I'm wondering if this is going to prevent them from having other bands in the game going forward.

410
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,000
I have a theory about this.

411
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
I think that the logic behind this would be,

412
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:54,000
well, we counter-sue you to where if we've got to make all this content change,

413
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
then we want our money back, blah, blah, blah.

414
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:02,000
I think it's actually going to end up in some kind of closed-doors deal.

415
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,000
I'm sure it will, but they can't make the content change.

416
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
I mean, you can't just, and I've seen this going around on Twitter,

417
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,000
is that why don't they just patch it in?

418
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,000
Well, you can't patch to the Wii.

419
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
They have no system of patching on the Wii, and you can't patch to the PS2.

420
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
So you would have games, the damage is done, period.

421
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,000
You can't go back and fix it.

422
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
And you would have people complaining, hey, you're removing content from the game.

423
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,000
What the hell?

424
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:31,000
Well, maybe I want, no doubt, to sing some stupid song, because it's funny, and I enjoy that.

425
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
And you're removing that ability for a game that I paid for.

426
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:39,000
To me, the counter-suit just seems like a, we fucking mean it, kind of thing.

427
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,000
Like, you guys are wrong, and we fucking mean it.

428
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
To me, this seems like they want to recoup their legal fees.

429
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:48,000
That's it. I don't think they honestly would expect to win the whole thing,

430
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:53,000
but I would think it's just legal fees that they see this as a, quote, unquote, frivolous lawsuit.

431
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:56,000
And I do see them winning this, actually, because the reason why is,

432
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:02,000
if they have them sign to a contract that agrees, you know, that their likenesses can be used in this fashion,

433
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,000
there's not really much they can do.

434
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:08,000
They can bitch and moan about it, saying, well, I didn't realize it was going to be this.

435
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
Well, maybe you should have fucking read the contract closer then.

436
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,000
You know, same with the whole Kurt Cobain thing.

437
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:19,000
Yeah, it's tragic, but maybe you shouldn't have, I don't know, first off, licensed his, you know, likeness to be in the game,

438
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,000
and maybe you should have read your contract.

439
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:24,000
Well, my thought is, though, maybe they were shady about it,

440
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:29,000
and that's the only way I could see, no doubt, winning this thing, hands down,

441
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:34,000
is that if they were shady, like if they were able to prove that Activision kind of lied to them about it,

442
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:38,000
like, you know, and I think when this topic first came up with the Courtney Love thing a few months ago,

443
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:42,000
where it kind of started this whole thing, I think I kind of said this then,

444
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:46,000
and that is that, you know, when they showed this to Courtney Love,

445
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:50,000
or when they showed this to No Doubt, they probably didn't show them all this other stuff,

446
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,000
because of course they're not going to like that.

447
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:56,000
They wanted to show people having a good time, no doubt, singing No Doubt songs.

448
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:00,000
You're not going to win No Doubt over by showing them in the band playing Taylor Swift songs.

449
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
That's not going to be how you get them to sign on the dotted line,

450
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:08,000
and it's not like the band is going to take the time to sit down for four hours and play this game extensively.

451
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,000
Maybe that's the real problem before they sign on the dotted line.

452
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
Maybe somebody from their band should have played through the thing,

453
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:19,000
or kind of known what was going to happen based off of characters previously in Guitar Hero 3, right?

454
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,000
Because we had Slash and stuff in Guitar Hero 3.

455
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:26,000
I just think, I mean, you know, the only thing it's going to do is,

456
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:30,000
I think, hurt their chances now to have these people in their games next time.

457
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,000
That's true, yeah.

458
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
But the thing is, though, the majority of the artists in the game,

459
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,000
I mean, they're not the only ones that were in the game, aren't really bitching about it.

460
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:42,000
I mean, I don't think they really care.

461
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,000
It's only No Doubt.

462
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:48,000
I could, you know what, to be fair, I mean, I'm a fan of No Doubt.

463
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,000
Do I think they're overreacting? Yeah, a little bit.

464
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
But I gotta be honest, I would be a little pissed off, too,

465
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,000
if I didn't know that this was going to happen.

466
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:59,000
And if you had me in a video game singing a fucking Taylor Swift song,

467
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
oh my god, that bitch was like nails on a chalkboard to me.

468
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
I would not want to be associated with that, personally.

469
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:08,000
So I would be mad if I was an artist, you know, like that.

470
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,000
But at the same time, I would have to realize that,

471
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:14,000
oh, fuck, I should have maybe thought about that before I agreed to be in this video game.

472
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:18,000
But I think you're right, I think this is going to really screw their chances in the future

473
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
of being able to land some really big names, because, you know, No Doubt,

474
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:25,000
they got friends, so does Courtney Love, believe it or not.

475
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:29,000
She got friends, and, you know, bands are going to think twice.

476
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,000
And maybe they'll think twice, and they'll also realize that,

477
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:37,000
hey, you know, this is what's going to happen if you get involved with Activision.

478
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:41,000
You know, they'll see based on this, you know, if that's something they don't want,

479
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
then they won't get involved. Or they'll just, for the next one,

480
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
they'll just lock it so that these characters can only sing their songs or something like that.

481
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:52,000
Regardless of how this all goes down, I would really like to see it settled on Judge Judy, personally.

482
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
I would like to see Judge Judy settle this whole thing,

483
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:00,000
because, tell you what, if you ever watch that show, awesome.

484
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:04,000
And I'd like to just see her yell at the people from Activision,

485
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
Don't talk when I'm not talking to you!

486
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:12,000
Anyhow, chirp, chirp, chirp, chirp.

487
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
Moving on to completely different news, and quickly.

488
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:20,000
Mega Man X has been announced. Mega Man X, I think a lot of us kind of saw this coming.

489
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,000
Mega Man 9 was obviously very well received.

490
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:26,000
So Mega Man X is coming out, not to be confused with Mega Man X.

491
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:33,000
So this is actually Mega Man X, not a roman numeral or anything, or a completely different series as X was.

492
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
Mega Man X is on its way, and it's coming out for WiiWare.

493
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,000
At least that's all that's announced right now.

494
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:42,000
But I wouldn't take that to mean that it's not coming out for 360 and PS3,

495
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
because Capcom likes to multi-platform their stuff.

496
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:49,000
But Nintendo Power is getting the first announcement on this.

497
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
Of course they're not going to tell you it's available on 360 and PS3.

498
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:55,000
Wait, didn't it come out on WiiWare first before with 9?

499
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
Or was that when there was a slight delay or something like that?

500
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
It's probably going to be on all platforms.

501
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,000
It was probably like a weak delay or something like that.

502
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,000
It'll be on all platforms.

503
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:09,000
So Mega Man X has been announced. It's coming out. It's retro-tastic again.

504
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,000
The whole NES style.

505
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,000
And one of the new bosses has been announced.

506
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,000
Sheep Man!

507
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:19,000
Yes, I'm not joking. Sheep Man. There's even some artwork out there.

508
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:22,000
It just looks kind of funny.

509
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:28,000
Anyhow, also there's supposed to be Proto Man as a playable character again.

510
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
And there will be a third mystery character.

511
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,000
It better be Forte.

512
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:37,000
It could be a variety of things. It could be Roll. Who knows?

513
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
Maybe it's Dr. Wily in a strange twist.

514
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
Because apparently Dr. Wily is not the villain this time.

515
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
Although, come on. Dr. Wily is always the villain at the end of the day.

516
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
It was Dr. Cossack, though.

517
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:53,000
Did you notice in that little screenshot there that they have the dragon shooting guns out of its nipples?

518
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,000
Which is kind of disturbing.

519
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,000
Ew, that is a little strange.

520
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:01,000
Well, that's just the awkward artwork that Capcom has learned to embrace.

521
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,000
They're terrible, terrible box art for Mega Man 1 and 2.

522
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
There will be dragons with nipple guns. I see it now.

523
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,000
Nipple Man!

524
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:12,000
That would... It should be Nipple Woman.

525
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:17,000
Sadly, I don't see that happening. I think this is supposed to be a friendly family game going on.

526
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,000
But, Sheep Man, that's...

527
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,000
If we have Sheep Man, we should have Cock Man.

528
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,000
What would be Sheep Man's weapon?

529
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:28,000
Like, a wooly gun? I don't know what it is.

530
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,000
A sleep gun.

531
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
Allergies! The allergy blaster.

532
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:34,000
The allergy blaster.

533
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,000
Like, he shoots at Mega Man and Mega Man gets a rash.

534
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
Also supposed to be in the game an easy mode.

535
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:42,000
Which, for those folks that were struggling a little bit in Mega Man 9,

536
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
I'm sure an easy mode will be welcomed for the game.

537
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,000
Including me, I'm sorry.

538
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
Mega Man 9, I think I got past like three bosses and that's as far as I could get.

539
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,000
So, yeah.

540
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:56,000
I would like to see Mega Man a little bit easier.

541
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,000
Just a little bit for us wussies.

542
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,000
Mega Man 2 kind of had an easy mode.

543
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,000
Or as it was called in America, normal mode.

544
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,000
Anyhow.

545
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,000
Dark Sakura, what do you got for us tonight?

546
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:11,000
Well, it's a particular, actually, it's a bit of fine culture, Rob.

547
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,000
A bit of fine culture.

548
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,000
It's a stage production, actually.

549
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,000
Oh, awesome.

550
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,000
So, culture.

551
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,000
Is it like the fabulous news I found out last night that Sister Act, the movie,

552
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,000
is being adapted for Broadway next year?

553
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,000
I thought it had already been done.

554
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,000
It had been done. It's in London right now.

555
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,000
And it's going to be on Broadway next year.

556
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,000
They did Xanadu.

557
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,000
I know. It did pretty well, actually.

558
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,000
I think it finally closed, but it did very well.

559
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:38,000
Well, this is about another fine stage production,

560
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
but actually it's being done in Sweden.

561
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
It's a Silent Hill stage production.

562
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,000
Okay.

563
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:52,000
So, imagine you step out onto the, you know, the curtain pulls back,

564
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:57,000
and you see a man wandering around wearing a car suit,

565
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:01,000
swerving off the road, and then getting out of the car suit to go chase

566
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:04,000
a 30-year-old dressed as a 5-year-old girl.

567
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
And the production takes like 50 fog machines.

568
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,000
Yeah, 50 fog machines.

569
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,000
So, but yeah, really.

570
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,000
But they're going to be posting the whole play on YouTube.

571
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,000
Nice.

572
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,000
So, keep an eye out for that.

573
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,000
It's done by a bunch of fans.

574
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,000
I would say that this play would get shut down immediately

575
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,000
for copyright infringement issues.

576
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,000
Oh, it's based on Silent Hill 2.

577
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,000
But, seeing as this is in another country,

578
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,000
I don't know if that's as easy to do.

579
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,000
Plus, I mean, I don't know.

580
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,000
If I were Konami, I'd be kind of flattered.

581
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,000
Like, I wouldn't want to shut it down.

582
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,000
I think if I were Konami, I'd be like,

583
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,000
oh shit, how are they going to pull this off?

584
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
One of my friends on LiveJournal, they did like a Star Wars play.

585
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,000
They did a play out of Star Wars, the movie,

586
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,000
and I think they were afraid they were going to get shut down.

587
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,000
But it turned out, like, Lucas embraced it,

588
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
and it ended up being, like, officially endorsed by them.

589
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,000
I have a theory about George Lucas, Rob.

590
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,000
What's that?

591
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,000
I think he really just likes pissing people off.

592
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
No, this is a good thing. It was impressive.

593
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,000
But I think that he likes doing the things that no one expects him to do.

594
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,000
I see.

595
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
Which is, you know, I was like, oh, so this is what you think happens to the story.

596
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,000
Well, I'm changing it!

597
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,000
And then I'm going to put in a character that annoys you all.

598
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,000
So this is who you thought shot first.

599
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,000
Well, you was wrong.

600
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
That's okay, Joss Whedon is my Lord and Master now.

601
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:20,000
Anyhow, Silent Hill the play, yes or no?

602
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,000
Well, I would love to watch it, except the whole thing is going to be in Swedish.

603
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:28,000
Which, you know what this means. We need Aki Ripper to go out and observe the play for us.

604
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
Aki Ripper, you are now our theater reviewer?

605
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
Congratulations, you just promoted to OLR.

606
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:38,000
He's not even listening right now, I'm sure, because we're on it at a completely different time.

607
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:44,000
But, you know, if you're listening on Sunday, Aki Ripper, you are now our official Broadway correspondent.

608
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,000
This counts for Swedish Broadway.

609
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
Rob, MXT, by the way, going back to the Mega Man story.

610
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:54,000
Oh yeah. So according to Wiki, so Sheep Man's weapon, according to Wikipedia, is thunder wool.

611
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
Thank you, chatters, chat.orangelaundry.com.

612
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,000
Thunder wool.

613
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,000
Was it just using static?

614
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
Do you just rub the wool against your body a whole lot and generate the static?

615
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,000
Aki Ripper isn't chat!

616
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,000
Is he? Oh!

617
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,000
You are now our theater correspondent.

618
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,000
Oh, Aki Ripper's here. Congratulations, Aki Ripper, you've been promoted. Now go see the Silent Hill play.

619
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,000
Thunder wool.

620
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:20,000
Thunder wool. It's probably playing on the complete other side of Sweden. It's like hours and hours away from where Aki Ripper's at.

621
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,000
Well, how long does it take to get across Sweden?

622
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:26,000
I don't know. By foot or by car or by plane.

623
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,000
It depends, I guess, which direction you're going to.

624
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:33,000
I'm going to be the ignorant American and say, Sweden's not that big. Come on.

625
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,000
Well, keep in mind...

626
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,000
I think it's about the size of California. I don't think it's much bigger than California.

627
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:46,000
Yeah, keep in mind, our states are technically little small countries. We just happen to be under one big federation.

628
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
Sort of like, I guess, the European Union without having to...

629
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,000
Or like Star Trek.

630
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:58,000
Yes, Rob. Someone linked me to a Star Trek menorah, by the way, that someone made out of action figures and LED lights.

631
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,000
Beautiful.

632
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:04,000
Aki Ripper says he's 14 hours away from where he is.

633
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
That's not that far. Get on a plane.

634
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,000
We'll send you gas money.

635
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,000
Get on a plane.

636
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,000
Loki, what do you have for us?

637
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,000
Wait, before you get there.

638
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:20,000
Fine, if Aki Ripper is going to boohoo about 14 hours away, even though he's closer than any of the rest of us,

639
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:25,000
then we need a Swede who's listening to the show who can go, who lives next door to this.

640
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:31,000
Maybe that was answering if it was 14 hours to get from one end of the country to the other.

641
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,000
Oh.

642
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,000
I don't know. I give up.

643
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,000
Or by sheep.

644
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,000
We'll just wait for the damn thing to get on YouTube.

645
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,000
It's like Dark Tetsuya said no, by sheep.

646
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,000
By Thunderwool Airlines.

647
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
Thunderwool! Thunderwool!

648
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,000
This Sunday, Sunday, Sunday!

649
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:54,000
Live at the Monster Truck Rally, see the big trucks take on Thunderwool!

650
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:59,000
Under 18, not emitted. Without parental consent.

651
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,000
Brain hurt. I need another cookie.

652
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,000
Loki, we need another story.

653
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,000
Aren't these cookies epic?

654
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,000
Those cookies are epic. They have little crushed candy canes in them.

655
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,000
They're Oreos, but with candy canes in them.

656
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:13,000
They're the Trader Joe's version of Oreos, but they're called Candy Cane Jojos.

657
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
Aw, and you thought we forgot Orange Lounge Fudio tonight, ladies and gentlemen.

658
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:23,000
So, remember that story that we talked about, the PSP Minis being playable on the PS3, how it was a rumor and everything?

659
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:29,000
Well, this week, update 3.15 came out, allowing you to play PSP Minis on your PS3.

660
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,000
So, hooray!

661
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:40,000
You know, if you were very envious of your PSP Minis, and you possibly didn't own a PSP, well, now you can play them on your PS3.

662
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:50,000
And the best part about that is, too, that one purchase of the PSP Mini obviously will allow you to play it both on the PS3 and on the PSP.

663
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:59,000
And you'll also be able to connect the two systems via LAN to transfer data from one system to the next.

664
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,000
So that's kind of neat.

665
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:16,000
Oh, that was the other add-on from 3.15. It'll allow you to transfer data. In case you bought a new PS3 system when they slimmed down a bit, you can actually transfer data from one to the other using an ethernet cable.

666
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:20,000
By the way, did you hear about that not all the games will work right away?

667
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:28,000
Because I was kind of excited about this. I was like, oh, cool! I really like the idea of something I can play on my PSP I can also play on the PS3.

668
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:35,000
You know, I kind of like that idea. Like the PS1 games, you can kind of already do that with, but I like the idea of newer games.

669
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:42,000
Of course, then when I looked at what Minis were available, I was kind of like, none of this sounds interesting to me without having seen the demo or anything.

670
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:49,000
But did you hear, most of them don't work right now. They're going to have to patch it in later, even though they did this big upgrade.

671
00:38:49,000 --> 00:39:01,000
Well, here's what I want to know. If you're able to play these PSP Minis on your PS3, is that going to lead way to playing PSP games on your PS3?

672
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:07,000
And then we won't need the PSP anymore? You can just buy your game and play the systems?

673
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:11,000
I would like that. I don't know if that's something they would do.

674
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,000
They could.

675
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:23,000
I guess they could. Oh man, could you imagine the game library, how much that would expand? Actually, there are a lot of things on PSP I would be very excited to play on my television, but of course that's why they have video out.

676
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:36,000
Well, can you imagine? That would be a good selling point for the PSP Go, I would think. If you had, you know, you could download it on your PSP Go and transfer it to your PS3 and play it both places or whatever and take it on the road with you or something.

677
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:43,000
I don't know, but it'd be a good idea. It's the next step to getting to the PlayStation 2 on the PS3.

678
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:56,000
I don't know, chatters, what do you think? chat.orangelandsradio.com, do you think that having PSP games playable on the PS3 is a good idea for Sony, if it was technically possible? Let's assume that it's technically possible.

679
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:06,000
I don't know, do you remember the early, early rumors of the PlayStation 3 and some of the trademarks actually showed a UMD drive on the PS3? Do you remember that?

680
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:15,000
I remember that vaguely, years and years ago, before this thing came out. Some of the early trademarks, I think we reported on the show, had a UMD drive in it.

681
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
So maybe this is something they were thinking of at one time.

682
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,000
Maybe.

683
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,000
Maybe neat.

684
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:29,000
Alright, well one game that isn't on the PS3, well it is on the PS3, but the PS3 game is amazing, is LittleBigPlanet.

685
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:39,000
This game has kind of gotten coverage a lot in the past few weeks on our show, which is amazing for a game that's been out a year, again continuing to be supported.

686
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:48,000
One way that is continuing is through an alliance with Disney for Pirates of the Caribbean content to be added to LittleBigPlanet.

687
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:54,000
LittleBigPlanet, that's right, you will soon get to play Captain Sack, who looks a lot like Captain Jack Sparrow.

688
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:59,000
And I gotta say, he is adorable looking, if you see the little Sackboy with the Captain Jack outfit on, he's awesome.

689
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:07,000
And this is really in line with the fact that they have already announced that water is going to be the next big thing they add in LittleBigPlanet.

690
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:15,000
Because you know, the last big mechanic they added was a year ago in the Metal Gear Solid content, they added the gun, the paint gun, and that changed the way you build levels.

691
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:22,000
Well now they're going to have water, the Sackboys can swim in water, that's going to be huge for developmental levels, and whole new ideas will be there.

692
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:29,000
But of course, this is a great tie-in to have water-based content, because obviously, Pirates of the Caribbean, they sail on water.

693
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:38,000
This is all supposed to come out, by the way, the rumor is, all of this is hitting before Christmas, which would mean probably next week, if this is true.

694
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:48,000
Keep in mind, LittleBigPlanet has not had any major expansion like this, I mean, granted they've kept the game fresh with the levels, the costumes, and some of those things, the stickers and somewhat,

695
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:55,000
but this is the first major game-changing thing they've done since the Metal Gear Solid content.

696
00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:03,000
And I think it's awesome, I will probably buy it, and I haven't played LittleBigPlanet in quite some time, so this is something that I guess you could say could get me back, I don't know.

697
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:12,000
So, hey, going into our chatroom, chat.orangelandradio.com, some of the comments from my earlier question about, do you think PSP games should be on the PS3?

698
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:21,000
ToaGak says, only if they give us our fucking UMD drive back. Well, technically they never took it away. The PSP 3000 still being made, still being sold, yes?

699
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:25,000
And much better than the PSP Go.

700
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:34,000
AlphaKananagram says, sure, why not? PS1 games are allowed on PS3 and they look shitty, so why not PSP games? Well, now hold on, the PS1 games only look shitty because you're spoiled.

701
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:42,000
And those games were made for a different time when we didn't have HD TVs, even though I'm only talking like 10 years ago, technology was different back then.

702
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:46,000
We're all spoiled now. They look shitty because we have better TVs, right?

703
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:55,000
Yeah. Let's see, BowerCTU says it's no different than the Super Game Boy. I guess that's true, you know, we put Game Boys on our TVs a long time ago.

704
00:42:56,000 --> 00:43:07,000
Let's see, also going into the LittleBigPlanet story, AlphaKananagram says, Sky, also, you heard that the water expansion pack for LittleBigPlanet may be coming soon due to a leak in update trophies.

705
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:17,000
Yeah, I honestly think these two are probably tied together, and it's like, just like the Metal Gear Solid brought us the gun, pirates will probably bring us the water. That's my thought.

706
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:26,000
And one other thing from chat, Tigerclaw says, who knows, perhaps Sony is secretly working on a PSP 4000, which will probably be a hybrid of the Go or something.

707
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:36,000
You never know what Sony might be doing. I don't know so much about another PSP revision, I think honestly the next thing we're going to get is like a PSP 2, but I've been wrong before, who knows.

708
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,000
Anyhow, DarkSakura, what's up next for us?

709
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:40,000
Stuff.

710
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:41,000
And such?

711
00:43:41,000 --> 00:44:07,000
Yeah, there's actually been an announcement by SNK for some Xbox Live Arcade games. We actually have Metal Slug 7 isn't coming out, but Metal Slug XX or maybe XX is, you know, the PSP remixed version of the DS one is going to be coming out in 2010 instead.

712
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:20,000
And as far as Xbox Live Arcade fighting games, there's going to be King of Fighters 2002 Ultimate Match and Neo Geo Battle Colosseum. There also will be the King of Fighters Sky Stage.

713
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:22,000
That looks stupid.

714
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,000
It looks incredibly stupid, but I think I want to play it just for lulz.

715
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:29,000
So hey, more Metal Slug for me.

716
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
And that's never quite a bad thing?

717
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:37,000
More flying Iori shooting things in the sky with his big Orochi self.

718
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,000
And how?

719
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:52,000
Well something you don't have to wait too long for would be this week's releases. And unfortunately, being that we're so close to Christmas, it is very light.

720
00:44:53,000 --> 00:45:00,000
This week we have Twin Sector on PC. You have little kids, Reader Rabbit Kindergarten on the Nintendo DS.

721
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
They are still cranking out Reader Rabbit games?

722
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:08,000
Dude, you do not even have any idea. There is like four or five Reader Rabbit games coming out.

723
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:10,000
I remember Reader Rabbit on the Apple IIe.

724
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:12,000
Yeah.

725
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:16,000
They have four Wii games and four DS games coming out. Of course, all the same.

726
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:32,000
Konami Classics Vol. 1 and 2 this week. Vol. 1, of course, contains Castlevania Symphony of the Night, Frogger, and Super Contra, whereas Vol. 2 includes Russian Attack, Track and Field, and the regular Contra.

727
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:37,000
Both of those for 20 bucks and out on 360. They're basically just the Xbox Live arcade games.

728
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:50,000
And then also, more stuff for little kids. Playmobil Pirates and Playmobil Circus. Pirates for the DS and Circus for the Wii. And that's it.

729
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:54,000
That still sounds like a lot, considering where we're at.

730
00:45:55,000 --> 00:46:00,000
That's sad. There's actually some better stuff. Well, next week's even lighter, but it's really like two games, but they're decent games.

731
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:07,000
Well, I wish I could say it's a slow week in Japan, but it's really not. It's actually still a pretty big week over there.

732
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:20,000
Going to the Japanese releases, on the Xbox 360 and the PlayStation 3, there is a 30th anniversary collection for Gundam. It's Gundam Musou 2. It comes out in Japan on the Xbox 360 and the PlayStation 3.

733
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:24,000
But Gundam Musou 2, isn't that Dynasty Warriors Gundam 2?

734
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:29,000
I believe so. It looks very much like it. The whole combo meter in the corner and everything.

735
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:31,000
Probably the re-release.

736
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:40,000
Yeah, and the graphics look very pretty. But, of course, this week is epic week in Japan, and actually for a lot of people here in the U.S. too, I know a lot of people are going to be importing.

737
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:53,000
Final Fantasy XIII does come out on the PlayStation 3. Seeing as the PlayStation 3 is region free, if you want to pay $100, yes, that's right, that's what some importers are charging for this, $100, you can import this game.

738
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,000
It's all Japanese. I don't feel like translating.

739
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:02,000
Yeah, but for some people that know it light or know enough and just can't wait until March, hey, there you go.

740
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:04,000
I did that with 8 and would never do it again.

741
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:14,000
The Wii has not been forgotten. There are some releases over there. Of course, they get the Gundam game too, as well as Need for Speed Nitro comes out in Japan and F1 2009, so a couple of racers there in Japan.

742
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:22,000
On the PlayStation 2, this game has a lulsy title, Death Connection comes out on the PlayStation 2. Not the Love Connection.

743
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:24,000
It's the Death Connection.

744
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:30,000
That's what comes after the Love Connection, the Death Connection. I've got to read this description. Can I read this here?

745
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:36,000
Amelia was entrusted to the priest when she was a baby. Growing up in the small town church, the girl became a gentle beauty.

746
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:46,000
Along with the priest and Joshua, a boy she sees as a brother, she lived a peaceful life. However, everything changed the night mafia members charged into the church seeking to end Amelia's life.

747
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:57,000
So it's got everything. It's got the mafia, church, religion, things. It's all in the Death Connection coming out on the PlayStation 2.

748
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:07,000
And on the Nintendo DS, Dear Girl Stories Hibiki Tokukun Daisaku Sen comes out in regular and limited edition.

749
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:15,000
Deca Sports DS also making its way to the Nintendo DS, and Loki I know has already probably pre-ordered Jewel Pet 2 comes out on the DS.

750
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:27,000
As well as a game I first read as Pee Pee Girl, but it's actually Poopy Girl. That's P-O-U-P-E-E Girl DS. That's right, a game called Poopy Girl.

751
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:31,000
I don't want to really know what this game is about, yet I am intrigued.

752
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:41,000
It's actually a game where you develop good fashion sense. You do hairstyle, eye color, shape of the face, and then you take her out and shop for her in Poopy Town.

753
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:48,000
And a total of eight people can play Poopy Girl all at once.

754
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,000
It's just not like po-pay or something? Like French or something?

755
00:48:52,000 --> 00:49:00,000
The chat room is yelling at me. It's like po-pay, just the way it's pronounced. But I'm sorry when I read it in my honky American way. P-O-U-P-E-E Poopy Girl.

756
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:14,000
To which all the Japanese purists are screaming at me in chat room. On the PSP, Dice Dice Fantasia.

757
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:16,000
Dice Dice Baby?

758
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:20,000
Do you even care? Do you even care when Poopy Girl's out this week?

759
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:22,000
That... no.

760
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:28,000
Anyhow, moving on. Dark Sakura, what's coming out in the UK?

761
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:39,000
Well, not a busy week. We have, for our buddies overseas, we have on the 15th EverQuest Underfoot. Does anyone still play EverQuest?

762
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,000
A lot of people wouldn't be doing these expansions.

763
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:51,000
I guess. On the 16th we have Alien Breed Evolution. On the 17th we have Blue Toad Murder Files, whatever the fuck that is.

764
00:49:51,000 --> 00:50:02,000
On the 18th we have Buzz Quiz World, and on the 19th we have Nicky Rockin' Ball. That's it.

765
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:07,000
I'm laughing over here from this comment in chat about Poopy Girl. Sorry, Po-Pay Girl.

766
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:13,000
Salacious Pop says, she spends the entire game walking funny and looking upset.

767
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:15,000
That is excellent.

768
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:24,000
AlphaKananagram says, Sky, y'all are trying to kill me by making me laugh to death. Well, we try to be funny once in a while.

769
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:30,000
Anyhow, moving on to some more news. Our classic game of the week, just a few minutes away.

770
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:48,000
Yes. So, apparently, I didn't even realize there was a whole lawsuit against Divino, but there was, apparently by Nintendo, trying to prevent the company from selling DS flash carts.

771
00:50:48,000 --> 00:51:05,000
Apparently they won, I believe, their injunction in Hong Kong, but in France, and why they're trying to win it in France as well, apparently they lost.

772
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:29,000
Actually, Divino won that suit, and now, of course, Nintendo is appealing the ruling, and finally, I guess, another lawsuit against them to try to prevent them from selling DS flash carts because it enables people to, apparently they call it a game copying device.

773
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:39,000
Honestly, though, that's a little, I don't know, the device doesn't allow you to copy games, but it allows you to play copied games, I guess.

774
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:46,000
Okay, wait, somebody's gotta break this down for me, because I seem to remember talking about this when it was banned, or when the whole appeal was won in Hong Kong.

775
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:50,000
So now they're going to France. Is there a production of this going on there, too?

776
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:52,000
Well, it didn't win in Hong Kong. They actually lost in Hong Kong.

777
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:53,000
Oh.

778
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:55,000
They, actually, they still owe...

779
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:57,000
Shows you how much I was paying attention that night.

780
00:51:57,000 --> 00:52:04,000
Yeah, Nintendo made a statement that Divino still owes the company damages from a ruling made in Nintendo's favor in Hong Kong last year.

781
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:17,000
And it says, last month, a Spanish criminal case was dismissed against a company selling DS flash carts, with the judge in the case ruling that the carts are not illegal since they can be used for many non-infringing purposes.

782
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:31,000
So, it's kind of a gray area. I think if they're claiming that they're distributing game copying devices, I think right there, that would, they would lose that, because the device cannot be used.

783
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:39,000
Well, I mean, I guess it could be used, I don't know if there's a device on there to copy games from that, but it's not really used in copying games.

784
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:41,000
Don't you own this device?

785
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:42,000
The R4?

786
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:43,000
Yeah.

787
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:44,000
I own two in my life.

788
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,000
I have a, I have a Ninja Pass too.

789
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:48,000
I have an R4 and a, um...

790
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:50,000
Okay, have you ever used the R4 to pirate a game?

791
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:53,000
To pirate a game? No, I've used it to play pirate games, yes.

792
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:57,000
Okay, I see, I, tricky, tricky, I see what you did there, okay.

793
00:52:58,000 --> 00:52:59,000
Fine.

794
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:05,000
And I can't order from Divino because my bank doesn't like me ordering from countries across the sea.

795
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:07,000
Malaysia, I think, is where they're out of.

796
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:09,000
Yeah.

797
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:25,000
Alright, well, I, I don't know, I mean, I think if it's, uh, if it's being used for bad things, Nintendo has a right to some extent, but at the same time, there are legitimate purposes for these, I suppose, and you can't go after the, the people that are doing this for legitimate reasons.

798
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:31,000
You have to go after the people that are using it, you know, that are putting the, that are dumping the games and putting them on the web.

799
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:33,000
That's who they need to go after, is the people dumping the games.

800
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:56,000
It's just like, um, you know, with, like, BitTorrent and stuff like that, a lot of times they're going after the people that, the release groups that are dumping the titles because the downloading of the titles isn't really, you know, they're not really stealing any, I don't know, it's kind of tough with digital media and stuff, because you're not technically stealing something, you're just making a copy of it.

801
00:53:56,000 --> 00:54:04,000
And they're kind of going after more, like, real piracy, like, people actually making bootlegs and selling them on the street type stuff.

802
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:19,000
Well, moving on to one more story before we get to the classic game of the week tonight, um, we were actually linked to this story on our Twitter and it was suggested that we talk about this and, uh, Kotaku ran a feature this week about who they're calling, uh, well, it says, I guess the name of the story is Achievement Chore.

803
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:26,000
She plays for Gamerscore whether it's fun for not, fun or not, and it spotlights this girl and her name is Kristen and I guess, uh, her last name was redacted, obviously.

804
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:46,000
Um, I guess the author at Kotaku ran into this gal playing a game and exchanging scores and I guess she is the, according to this story, the number four ranking woman worldwide in Gamerscore and if you want to know how big you gotta get your Gamerscore to get that high, it's something like, um, of course now I lost, oh, there it is, 165,000 is her current Gamerscore.

805
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:56,000
And they actually take a picture of her and I gotta, you know, she's, she's a very attractive woman, I gotta say. I guess she's a stay-at-home mom and, uh, this is part of what she does.

806
00:54:57,000 --> 00:55:02,000
By the way, she also has, it almost looks like the exact same laptop I do. She has a little Toshiba, anyway, nobody cares.

807
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:08,000
But anyhow, they ran this little story on her, uh, she's a 24-year-old stay-at-home mom in Northwest Indiana.

808
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:18,000
She got started on this whole thing when it, I guess it became like a friendly race between her and her friend about Gamerscore and, um, it was a race to see who could get 20,000 first and now I guess it's just become an obsession.

809
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:28,000
The girl has, I guess, um, a Japanese Xbox 360 and a regular Xbox 360. She has mad respect in the community for, I guess, being nice.

810
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:39,000
Uh, she says, quote, once I found sites that had guides on which were the easy games, I beat 20,000 in like a month and a half. It got me hooked and it was like a drug. A bad drug, a bad habit.

811
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:46,000
So it's kind of interesting, I mean, we joke a lot about achievement whores here on the show and I know we've called Loki an achievement whore many times, but it's kind of like...

812
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:48,000
I just don't care anymore.

813
00:55:48,000 --> 00:56:03,000
I stopped caring and I did too to some extent, but it's kind of interesting to see what makes them tick, you know, and I thought this story was kind of interesting to give some insight as to what makes the achievement whore want to go after all those scores.

814
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:17,000
Um, by the way, you might like this too. There is stuff that she does besides the Xbox 360, obviously she's a stay at home mom, but she also says, I'm an avid paintball player. I have my own gun, although that's another expensive hobby.

815
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:26,000
But yeah, I'd much rather go out to a bar, go bowling, play darts or pool than sit at home and boost games all night. I'm still young. And she does have a six year old girl that she's raising too.

816
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:28,000
So, there you go.

817
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:30,000
Rob, I'm playing with poopies.

818
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,000
Alright. Did you go onto the website?

819
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:34,000
Yes, I did.

820
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:36,000
Was it Tiger Claw? Linked us to the...

821
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:38,000
I love these things.

822
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:49,000
I've been playing, well, keep in mind, I used to play with the candy bar doll maker thing, and I've got my big dolls, so this is actually kind of fun for me, even though like, you know...

823
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:51,000
So you like poopy girls?

824
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:55,000
Don't make me shoot you in the face, Rob.

825
00:56:55,000 --> 00:57:07,000
Since we were just talking about something we saw on Kotaku, I was just going to mention it real quick. There's a trailer I saw for The Sims 3, it was like a Happy Holidays trailer, that makes me want to play the game, actually.

826
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:09,000
Why is that?

827
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:25,000
It's the top ten reasons to play Sims, according to them. Your friends can throw rock and party, and then burn the house down, and so they show that, and then there's like another one, it's like, you know, these two women, oh, because learning a new language is sexy is number nine.

828
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,000
They have like the teacher wearing just lingerie and stuff.

829
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:31,000
So it's like all the really wrong things people do with The Sims.

830
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:38,000
Yeah, your sister can flirt with death, which is awesome, instead of your boyfriend, or her boyfriend, I guess.

831
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:50,000
And then they also have like, your kids can finally learn to get along, and they show the girl laughing maniacally, and her brother's on fire, and it's awesome.

832
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:58,000
Your grandma can still spy on the neighbors and not get arrested, and they have her peeping on some naked guy, which is kind of funny.

833
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:06,000
Your brother and sister, oh, your brother can finally get lucky, and they have like some chick staring them down.

834
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:11,000
Killing your boss, and then they have like, what are some of the other ones?

835
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:21,000
Experimenting, they have like two chicks, one dressed up like a cheerleader, one dressed up like, oh god, I don't remember what else the other one was.

836
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:26,000
Making out, and it's just all sex, violence, all the stuff you got.

837
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:32,000
All the great things about The Sims, right DarkSakura? Setting people on fire, it's your favorite thing about The Sims.

838
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:34,000
Actually, I like drowning him.

839
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:36,000
Nice.

840
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:38,000
That's funny, he's dying.

841
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:45,000
Alright, lol dying. Alright, well anyhow, if you're giving it to your best friend's mom, that was number two.

842
00:58:45,000 --> 00:59:04,000
Oh my gosh. Alright, if Loki's done with his ideas on what he's gonna do horrifically in The Sims, then it's time for a segment we like to call the classic game of the week. A chance for DarkSakura to go through the gaming archives and pick a game from yesteryear that she says, you know what? You bitches should be checking this game out.

843
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:07,000
Yeah.

844
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:14,000
And I closed the link to whatever she sent me earlier for the game, but that's alright. If you don't have a game, again, that's okay, I'll find it.

845
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:30,000
No, I can get it. Well the game is Einhonder, which is a pretty cool shooting game. It's pretty rare. Not as in it was made by Rare, but it's pretty rare of a game.

846
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:44,000
But anyway, it's a side-scrolling shooter, it was done by Square, and it came out on PlayStation in 1997. It did get a re-release for PSN on June 25th.

847
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:53,000
It means single-handed, because the ship that you use has a single manipulator arm.

848
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:55,000
That was the one that I thought sucked.

849
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:57,000
Sorry, it's just the first one I found.

850
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:59,000
There's one on there for stage 7 or stage 5.

851
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:01,000
Okay, I'll find it.

852
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:10,000
I'll find the right thing. But yeah, it's about a war between the Earth and the Moon, and it has a little cool soundtrack done by Fukui Kenichiro.

853
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:24,000
So yeah, you play through the game, and it's sort of a 2.5D, so it's got shifting camera angles, and everything in the game is 3D, but you mostly play in a two-dimensional method.

854
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:29,000
You've got different multiples, you've got different difficulty settings, multiples of those.

855
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:35,000
You do have a free mode that gives you unlimited continues, but you cannot have a score.

856
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:52,000
You can get at different speeds, and you start off with a machine gun, and you can collect gun pods that will give you different enemy missions, or cannons, or guided missile launchers, or even a lightsaber type of thing.

857
01:00:52,000 --> 01:01:01,000
There's also, you have to throw away your gun pods when you run out of ammo, so there's that.

858
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:23,000
Also, you have a multiplier bar and a hit gauge counter, so as you destroy the corners of the enemies, your hit counter increases, and you get multiplied points by that, but when you stop shooting things, your counter decreases.

859
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:26,000
So basically this is helping you for your score.

860
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:33,000
It's a pretty neat game. It's actually the first 3D shooter that Square did.

861
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:59,000
And they actually, it said that Square used some of what they learned from making Final Fantasy VII into Einhonder. And it actually, one cool thing about it is that there was another game that came out in Japan that was Chocobo no Fushigina Dungeon, which is, you know, Chocobo's mystery dungeon.

862
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:06,000
And it had a bonus mystery data disk, which actually was memory card data for a lot of games, including Einhonder.

863
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:18,000
Working Designs wanted to bring it out, but Square just actually did it anyway. So, really cool game, really cool, really fun game.

864
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:25,000
And you have to understand, really fucking hot for this era on the Playstation 1, like the graphics were just outstanding.

865
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:36,000
Oh yeah, and it's a pretty difficult game too. But yeah, I'd have to say that the play in it is really tight.

866
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:42,000
And also, the music that goes with the stages, I always thought was spot on.

867
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:51,000
The only thing that actually has a problem with it, I think, is that you can't play two player.

868
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:55,000
Oh, that's a bummer. She can't be, I guess, Zweihonder.

869
01:02:56,000 --> 01:03:01,000
Dude, if they did a sequel, I think they should do Zweihonder, and like, have two different gun arms.

870
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:03,000
It's possible.

871
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:05,000
That's it, Einhonder.

872
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:13,000
Alright, there you go kids, your classic game of the week this week is Einhonder, available on the Playstation numero uno.

873
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:24,000
Alright, that's going to do it for part 8 tonight, we're going to take a quick break though, we'll be right back with more of Orange Lounge Radio, our little special Saturday edition that will also play again on Sunday, and also play again on the podcast.

874
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:27,000
So stay tuned, we'll be right back with plenty more.

875
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:39,000
Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio on this Saturday afternoon, December the 12th of 2009.

876
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:46,000
That's right, we are taping a little bit early for tomorrow night's show, so you'll hear this again on Sunday, December 13th, of course, at our usual time.

877
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:51,000
And then of course on our podcast feed, available at www.OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

878
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:57,000
Now, during the break there, I had to get my new toy all out of the box and unpacked, and check this out.

879
01:03:57,000 --> 01:04:10,000
Awesome. That's right, my FC Mobile, I have Guardian Legend running on it. It took a little bit to get it jammed in there just the right way.

880
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:14,000
I even blew on the cartridge just to make sure, you know, the old school way to get that stuff to work.

881
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:18,000
But it works! So awesome. So very, very happy.

882
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:23,000
Anyhow, we have plenty more show to get to tonight, including our calls as usual.

883
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:27,000
I know there's less people listening than usual because of our special time, but hopefully we'll still get a few calls.

884
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:33,000
And of course we've got Twitter topics coming up in just a moment, but first we have some rapid fire stories.

885
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:42,000
Yes, there is a game that's out there on Microsoft's community game service that will help you talk to girls.

886
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:48,000
That's right, it's an indie game called Don't Be Nervous Talking to Girls.

887
01:04:48,000 --> 01:05:05,000
And it allows you to, I guess, practice by talking to a picture of a woman with some interactive dialogue that allows you to choose from a few different choices.

888
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:12,000
And if you don't, I guess, pick the right choice, she'll call the police.

889
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:14,000
Nice.

890
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:22,000
But there's some retarded choices, like there's one right here, it's all, that's one tall rollercoaster and greetings from planet Earth.

891
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:28,000
I would like to see DarkSakura play this game on how to talk to girls and see how it goes.

892
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:33,000
It's like, I am a girl! And I like being told I am from outer space!

893
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:35,000
It's only a dollar and 80 microseconds.

894
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:36,000
A whole dollar?

895
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:40,000
A whole dollar. I may pick this up just for shits and giggles.

896
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:44,000
Leo Shen in our chat room, chat.orangemantraded.com says, will they have a choice to put it in?

897
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:48,000
Stick it in!

898
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:50,000
Ah, yes.

899
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:52,000
Maybe in the sequel.

900
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:59,000
Maybe in the sequel. Well, Yakuza 3 is making its way over to the US as well.

901
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:09,000
It's going to be heading over here March 2010, and will feature the wonderful gameplay that the Japanese have already been able to check out for a while now.

902
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:14,000
And it's also actually coming to Europe and Australia around that same time frame as well, so that's kind of cool.

903
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:21,000
Also, 505 Games announced a brand new series that they're going to be putting out called Naughty Bear.

904
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:26,000
And I have to admit, their bear rendering ability is quite amazing.

905
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:28,000
You've been a very naughty bear.

906
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:32,000
Of course, in gay culture, naughty bear means a whole other thing.

907
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:40,000
Yeah, yeah. Apparently, the game is actually a violent action game starring an animated stuffed bear.

908
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:46,000
Specifically, a stuffed bear who swears revenge on other jerk bears for failing to invite them to a party.

909
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:56,000
And so, your goal is to scare and irritate and of course hurt other bears, racking up naughty points as you do, using weapons strewn about the game's 30 stages.

910
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:59,000
Wait, so you play a bear encouraged to rape other bears?

911
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:02,000
Well, they never said rape. They said hurt.

912
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:04,000
In the face.

913
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:06,000
That's kind of cool.

914
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:09,000
They're calling it Manhunt for Teddy Bears.

915
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:18,000
That's really what it is. This is about violence. This is just teddy bears. It's okay. You can tear Teddy Ruxpin limb from limb. It doesn't matter. He's just a bear.

916
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:23,000
And it's coming from the developer, actually. It's the same developer that put out Wet.

917
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:28,000
Looking in our chatroom, of course, they are still hung up on the talking to girl game.

918
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:32,000
Tigerclaw says they probably have a version for the girls on how to talk to guys.

919
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:37,000
I don't think they need one. It's just with your tits. That's basically how they do it, right, DarkSagra?

920
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:42,000
It's just two buttons. Giggle, flash, tits.

921
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:46,000
It's just two buttons. Giggle and tits.

922
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:52,000
BowerCTU in our chatroom says, are one of the choices Are You Poopy Girl?

923
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:54,000
Lol.

924
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:58,000
See, I like that. Taking it back to a previous topic in the show. Good job.

925
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:05,000
Anyhow, going on to some other stories. Brutal Legend, of course. How has Brutal Legend sales been? They've been okay, right?

926
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:06,000
It's been alright.

927
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:14,000
Well, hopefully this will integrate sales a little bit. A new download content piece called The Hammer of Infinite Fate is coming out this week on December 17th.

928
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:25,000
It is a chance for you getting to, I guess, carve a giant disembodied head into Mount Rockmore of Tim Schafer, the developer of Brutal Legend.

929
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:27,000
I guess that's what you get. I don't know.

930
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:38,000
You also get an upgrade that shows every collectible that's on the map and some new outfits for Eddie and, what's probably a highlight for a lot of people, four new multiplayer maps.

931
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:47,000
It's going to cost you $4.99 on PS3, yet $6 on the Xbox 360, but that might be an error because usually those things are the same.

932
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:54,000
Hey, if you still haven't picked up DJ Hero, a place you could probably grab it is the Guitar Hero store. It got knocked down to $79.

933
01:08:54,000 --> 01:09:05,000
From what I understand, though, this thing got sold out very soon, so I don't think you can actually get this anymore, but it is still telling and worthy of reporting on that the price is already coming down,

934
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:09,000
meaning that maybe it's just a matter of time before this ends up in the bargain bins. I don't know.

935
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:16,000
As I tweeted earlier this week, the MPD numbers came out, and it's sold 333,000 units total.

936
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:18,000
Well, that's not bad.

937
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:20,000
In two months? No, that's not bad.

938
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:22,000
That's not bad at all.

939
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:27,000
It'll probably still sell a little more for Christmas. Do you think it's worthy enough of getting a sequel, then?

940
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:29,000
Oh yeah.

941
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:37,000
If Guitar Hero rocks the 80s or spins the 80s, I would be all over that. That'd be pretty awesome.

942
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:47,000
My problem with DJ Hero, and it's the same problem that I have with the Guitar Hero series, is there's not enough download content. We've had two so far.

943
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:51,000
I mean, come on, man. Both have been pretty good, for what it's worth.

944
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:56,000
But if this was a harmonics game, I'd be getting download content every fucking week.

945
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:03,000
Until they decide to discontinue it, which has finally happened on the PSP one, which is strange.

946
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:10,000
Well, that's fine, because that probably didn't sell that well, but Rock Band 2, you know, come on. Tons of shit out there.

947
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:17,000
Did you notice, by the way, that the Best Buy demo stations now are like a Rock Band 2 slash Beatles Rock Band hybrid game?

948
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:20,000
Oh, it's kind of interesting that the demo demos both games.

949
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:23,000
It's both games? Yeah. It's kind of interesting.

950
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:30,000
But it makes sense. Hey, also in Rapid Fire Tonight, the Nintendo Virtual Console has released some new stuff.

951
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:32,000
A lot, a lot of stuff this week.

952
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:42,000
Street Fighter Alpha apparently came out, as well as the arcade version of Shinobi, and Rayman for the DSi, which I thought was kind of interesting, is now out.

953
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:44,000
So that's a big title on DSi.

954
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:50,000
Lots of other stuff available on DSi, including Ball Fighter, Pop Island, Army Defender, and My Notebook.

955
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:58,000
Not a lot of exciting stuff on WiiWare, but of course the Virtual Console got the arcade version of Shinobi and Street Fighter Alpha for the Super Nintendo.

956
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:02,000
So if you were a fan of Alpha back in the day, you might want to go grab that.

957
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:05,000
That is now available on the Virtual Console.

958
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:07,000
Dr. Sakura?

959
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:12,000
Well, in other news, we have something that actually I'm pretty considering trying out.

960
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:17,000
It's a Voltron game on iPhone, and apparently has the best unpause feature.

961
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:36,000
It's actually being put out for the 25th anniversary of the series, so you've got 30 levels, 6 acts total, where you play as the lions going through the galaxy to stop Zarkon and everybody, and all the weapons and everything.

962
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:54,000
And it's actually supposed to be, I think, pretty neat, but there's a video up here actually that I haven't watched yet, but apparently the unpause sound effect is supposed to be amazing.

963
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:58,000
I imagine they're like rips from Voltron or something, probably?

964
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:00,000
I'm going to check this out.

965
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:05,000
Oh, there's stupid ads.

966
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:08,000
Are you trying to play a little video over there?

967
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:10,000
Yeah, and now the ad won't stop.

968
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:12,000
Stupid Google!

969
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:32,000
Continuing on with this music over the background, Pac-Man Championship Edition is on the iPhone as well for $3, and that's the revamped Xbox Live Arcade one with all the fun mode, but this is a limited starting price.

970
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:34,000
So now let's go back to Voltron.

971
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:36,000
So Voltron came to the iPhone today?

972
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:38,000
Oh yeah, someone talking about it.

973
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:44,000
Blah, blah, blah, blah. Oh, there we go.

974
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:48,000
See, I don't know if anyone can hear any of this.

975
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:50,000
I'm trying to find the unpause.

976
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:55,000
So it's the sound effects.

977
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:57,000
I'm assuming it's what it is.

978
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:04,000
And it sounds like the music in the game is actually from, dude, you have Sven when you start off, that's cool.

979
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:09,000
Anyway, moving forward, how about some Rock Band stuff?

980
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:11,000
Rock Band!

981
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:17,000
Rubber Soul! Finally! Finally, finally, finally! Very happy, because that's my favorite Beatles album.

982
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:28,000
So we are going to be getting Rubber Soul next week for a Beatles Rock Band, because we already got Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band and Abbey Road.

983
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:39,000
And then we are also going to be, for the other Rock Band, we're going to be getting All American Rejects, 30 Seconds to Mars, and more Green Day.

984
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:48,000
And Rock Band unplugged download content is, I'm not sure.

985
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:56,000
It actually isn't going to be getting any more download content from what it seems. So, that's it.

986
01:13:56,000 --> 01:14:00,000
By the way, some late-breaking news, I believe, speaking of the whole Rock Band thing.

987
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:08,000
Apparently, there's this teaser going on on MTV.com about this whole, I guess, Green Day Rock Band game.

988
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:11,000
Is there possibly a Rock Band game going on with Green Day in it?

989
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:15,000
I don't think it's going to be as big as, like, Beatles Rock Band. It may be an add-on content thing.

990
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:20,000
And we've speculated this before, like the ACDC game was.

991
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:22,000
Yeah.

992
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:28,000
Perhaps. This might be something that actually shows up during the VGAs later on, which I guess are happening later tonight.

993
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:33,000
I don't think, I mean, Green Day is okay, but do you really think they're popular enough to warrant their own game?

994
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:37,000
You know, I mean, you've got to live up to the Beatles.

995
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:45,000
And I realize the VGAs are on tonight, but come on. You're going to see all the winners later on, and all the clips will be on YouTube, any of the game trailers.

996
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:52,000
Yeah, well, but we also have some great programming on All Games Radio tonight. We have Undersedation Live at, I believe, 8 o'clock Pacific.

997
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:58,000
And Travis Is Always a Lolsie Time. That's the show I grew up on years ago. Video Game Show is on tonight, too, right after us.

998
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:05,000
Well, not right after, but about 7 o'clock, too. So stay tuned for both of those shows coming up on All Games Radio if you are listening live on Saturday.

999
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:08,000
Meanwhile, we've got some Twitter topics to get into.

1000
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:18,000
Going over to the Twitter at twitter.com slash o-l-r. We asked for some questions before the show.

1001
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:25,000
Some folks talking about Orange Lounge Radio Revolution's second mix, which I guess has some unlocks.

1002
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:35,000
Of course, this is the DDR game that they've made that apparently, by the way, hosts, check your emails later on, because apparently the creators have sent us a sneak peek to check out.

1003
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:44,000
I'm very curious. I find it odd that I host this show and I know really very little about what's going on here, so I'm very curious to see it, so there you go.

1004
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:53,000
Let's see. Just some people talking about listening to the show or not listening to the show tonight.

1005
01:15:54,000 --> 01:16:00,000
Let's see. Going to Leo Shan on Twitter says, any songs from a recent game that you can't get out of your head?

1006
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:04,000
For me, it's Bayonetta's Fly Me to the Moon climax mix.

1007
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:18,000
I thought that was kind of funny. My friend's like, hey, isn't this from, like, Neon Genesis? You know, like, yeah, and a bunch of other stuff, but it's an awesome game.

1008
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:31,000
I don't know if I have, like, a song stuck in my head, especially not one from a video game. For the longest time, though, I had that mix of Radio Gaga and Mary J. Blige from the download of DJ Hero that would get stuck in my head so easily.

1009
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:36,000
A lot of the stuff from DJ Hero's stuck in my head, because I played in my car on repeat, basically, so.

1010
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:41,000
Yeah. A lot of, like, Bust a Move with Around the World, you know?

1011
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:45,000
That's a good mix. That's a game I haven't played in forever that I really need to.

1012
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:48,000
Old school Bust a Move groove, whatever you want to call it.

1013
01:16:49,000 --> 01:17:01,000
Let's see, also, SSJ100Matt on Twitter is saying, Target is having some nice game deals starting this Sunday, including DJ Hero $88 and Zelda Spirit Tracks $25.

1014
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:18,000
That was another game I forgot to mention that I was playing this week, and it's alright, but my thing is, it's not the same as, like, you know, the other games where the method of travel by boat was kind of a necessity.

1015
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:28,000
The fact that they're like, oh no, we can't go to these parts of the lands because the tracks have disappeared, that's just to me saying, I'm lazy and I don't want to walk there.

1016
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:35,000
It's like fucking walking was all you did in Zelda, you know, Zelda 2, you know, Zelda 3, even.

1017
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:40,000
But now I'm too good for walking, I need to take a train everywhere.

1018
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:42,000
Waaaaaaah.

1019
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:45,000
It's really, you know, obnoxious.

1020
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:52,000
But yeah, it's still as fun as the original, well, I'd say, you know, the last game that they had.

1021
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:56,000
How does Zelda translate as, like, a rail shooter, though? That seems so odd to me.

1022
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:57,000
It's not, I thought that's what it was.

1023
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:09,000
No, it's just, they have these parts where you're riding a train, and that's kind of like the boat, you know, you get a cannon on the back, and there's evil trains on the tracks, which is retarded, but whatever.

1024
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:12,000
I want another Wind Waker.

1025
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:19,000
I mean, they keep putting out these DS games, so let's do another, like, GameCube style game or whatever, because Wind Waker is awesome. I need to go back and actually play that.

1026
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:22,000
A lot of people disagree with you, but they can suck it, right?

1027
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:29,000
They can suck it, because guess what? How many games have we seen that have been emulating, you know, the Wind Waker style being released? Well, at least two of them.

1028
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:36,000
How many games have we seen, you know, emulating the, you know, style of the Marie Lizzick Zelda? One.

1029
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:38,000
So tough.

1030
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:44,000
Alright, well, we'll see. Alright, listen, that's it for Twitter topics tonight. Twitter.com slash O-L-R if you want to give us a follow.

1031
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:48,000
Meanwhile, back to some more gaming news, and then our mailbag before too long.

1032
01:18:48,000 --> 01:19:00,000
Yes, there's a new patent that's been put out for the Sony Motion Controller, and it's showing a new feature, including swappable buttons, or like some sort of connector.

1033
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:10,000
Basically, at the top of the controller, or possibly even the bottom, I don't know, they show this kind of, like, upside down, with the Cosmic Ice Cream Cone facing down.

1034
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:32,000
Apparently, there is a little spot that you could possibly put in, either a D-pad, they have, like, the face buttons, you know, the X circle, square, triangle, and then what looks like a spinner, or some sort of spinning knob of some sort, maybe like the jog dial, I guess, on an iPod or something like that.

1035
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:47,000
And that's kind of part of this little thing, so maybe instead of, like, add-ons that you might see with, you know, the nunchuck and stuff like that, and the Wii, they're just going to have these replaceable control buttons.

1036
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:56,000
But honestly, I don't see what the point is in adding face buttons to it. I mean, when, you just have some generic buttons, and if you want to use them-

1037
01:19:56,000 --> 01:20:06,000
I don't know, it gives some more diversity for the developers. I would just worry about losing that shit. Those things look small, like, I would think losing them would be the problem. These little convertible things.

1038
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:21,000
Well, not only that, but, like, I would think, though, that, you know, the directional pad or whatever could be easily, you know, done with just four buttons, like the face buttons, so there's no need to double up on that, and the jog dial... I don't really see why they would need that.

1039
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:27,000
To spin the wheel in a Wheel of Fortune game, I don't know. I don't know.

1040
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:40,000
But to make the movement, then, with the whole motion controller. It's like, this is about, like, I don't know if you saw the article about Ubisoft with their, you know, crappy camera that they put out with that, you know, your self-fitness thing or whatever.

1041
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:56,000
Your shape, actually. And they have a new racquetball game coming out to kind of compete with Wii Sports Tennis or whatever, and it uses, as an option, it uses the camera. Well, all the previews I've seen using this camera have been crap.

1042
01:20:56,000 --> 01:21:09,000
Toagak in Chat says, Have you ever dealt with a DS game card before? Those are easy to lose. Like, saying that, you know, well, these things aren't much bigger than a DS card, probably, so if you can keep track of a DS game card, you can probably keep track of these little things. Maybe.

1043
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:13,000
Maybe, but, like, there's got to be an easier way to do this.

1044
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:23,000
Well, and it doesn't necessarily mean it's going to be true. You know, it's just, generally, patents, so that no patent whores try to get in there and, you know, patent it first.

1045
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:26,000
I'll just assume ten years down the road, you know, they always seem to do that.

1046
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:40,000
Well, Star Trek Online is coming out next year, and, of course, there's quite a few people excited about that, including our very own Dark Soccer, and I've got to admit, I am pretty excited about it, too, even though I'm a big wow-whore, and I've got to say, lovin' the new Patch 3-3. I didn't say this during my gaming week.

1047
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:51,000
Actually, I like it, too. Well, I've noticed that it flashes red now when you're being attacked, and it's sort of like, what the hell? Oh, I'm being attacked, instead of just random roar.

1048
01:21:51,000 --> 01:22:02,000
And the quest tracking thing, if you didn't have a mod for that before, is pretty awesome. I used a quest helper mod, so I already had that, and I've got to say, this whole Dungeon Finder is awesome.

1049
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:11,000
All the looking for group stuff is gone now. It's crazy, and I've got to be honest, all the groups I've gotten through the system have been really good.

1050
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:23,000
Like, I have yet to get a group full of douchebags like I used to get before. I don't know what it is. It's not like they have a filter on what kind of players get to use the group system, but I've just gotten a lot of really good players.

1051
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:26,000
So, I don't know if there's anybody excited or what.

1052
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:31,000
I don't know. I don't know. Very, very exciting. Anyway, but we want to get back to Star Trek Online.

1053
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:41,000
Star Trek Online, of course, is coming out soon, and a whole shitload of pre-order bonuses, but of course, it depends on where you pre-order it. That's right.

1054
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:45,000
And depending on where you pre-order, Star Trek Online will change the bonus that you get.

1055
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:53,000
So, for example, if you pre-order the game at GameStop, you can have the classic USS Enterprise. You can only get the classic Enterprise at GameStop.

1056
01:22:53,000 --> 01:23:02,000
So, there's going to be everybody riding around the USS Enterprise. I guess. I don't know. At the Best Buy, you can get a pet Tribble or a Targ, depending on what your faction is.

1057
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:04,000
Dude, totally want a Targ.

1058
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:08,000
And everybody knows when you get one pet Tribble. It's actually hundreds of pet Tribbles.

1059
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:20,000
If you pre-order on Amazon, you get a liberated Borg bridge officer with unique nanotechnology augmentation. So, in other words, you can have sex of nine as your bridge officer there.

1060
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:26,000
Dude, I actually totally think that I'm going to get mine on Amazon now, because I've actually got a gift card for Amazon.

1061
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:27,000
Do you really?

1062
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:28,000
Yeah, I do.

1063
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:37,000
Very cool. Let's see. Also, direct-to-drive, a multi-spatial personal shield. It regenerates itself and the player health. That's from direct-to-drive.

1064
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:39,000
Okay, that's actually really cool.

1065
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:53,000
At Walmart, you get bonus skill points. You'll be able to bestow additional skill points. At Target, you get a TR-116 ground weapon. That's a micro transporter that beams projectiles to the Target. No line of sight is required.

1066
01:23:54,000 --> 01:24:01,000
And lastly, if you do it on Steam, you get chromodynamic armor. It improves your critical hits and damage of energy weapons.

1067
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:10,000
So, I mean, those are all like game-changing items. That's a little weird to me, that depending on where you buy the game can kind of change up the game for you.

1068
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:19,000
I mean, I imagine even these little items they talk about aren't like the best things in the game. It seems to me, I gotta be honest, the Walmart one sounds good.

1069
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:26,000
If you get extra skill points that you can't get any other way, that seems like the best deal right there.

1070
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:36,000
But it seems to me, though, that, well, are they completely unique? I mean, does it say specific? Because, I mean, if you can get skill points as you keep going, you know, as you level, then what's the point?

1071
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:42,000
What kind of skills can you get from Walmart anyways? I mean, how to dress?

1072
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:47,000
Which one had the, um, the, the, what was it, the transphasic shield?

1073
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:52,000
Um, direct-to-drive has the shield that regenerates itself and your health.

1074
01:24:52,000 --> 01:25:02,000
I mean, I can imagine a Walmart bonus as being like, you know, you get to command the Enterprise, except the Enterprise has a new paint job with a Confederate flag on it.

1075
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:12,000
Honestly, I think, I wouldn't really want the classic Enterprise anyway, because given when the game is set, you'd like, it's like, it's like driving, um...

1076
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:14,000
A hoopty.

1077
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:21,000
I gotta be honest, the GameStop pre-order sounds the least interesting to me. I've gotta be honest, you know, this is Star Trek Online, not remake Star Trek The Next Generation.

1078
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:32,000
Well, it'd be the equivalent of everyone driving around in, like, a brand new Bugatti, right? And you're driving a 1983 Ford Escort.

1079
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:34,000
Nice.

1080
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:35,000
Seriously.

1081
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:37,000
A Geo Metro.

1082
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:43,000
I'm a pet whore, though, in WoW, so I'm almost, uh, down for this Best Buy pet tribble. That sounds kinda awesome.

1083
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:45,000
Is that the only way you're gonna be able to get this pet tribble?

1084
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:46,000
Don't know.

1085
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:49,000
I mean, is there gonna be a tribble wearing a Best Buy shirt or something like that?

1086
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:50,000
Don't know.

1087
01:25:51,000 --> 01:26:02,000
And besides that, the whole, the, you can, although I'm sure the tribbles are actually 90% reproductive organs, um, you can just feed them very little and they won't have enough energy to breed.

1088
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:10,000
A few comments from our chatroom at chat.orensonshooter.com on this story. VaniceLux says, exclusive Walmart greeter class. Maybe that's what you get at Walmart.

1089
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:19,000
SalaciousPop says, you're not gonna know how or what to min to max if you're just starting, and 99% of the MMOs nerf a lot of stuff within the first 90 days.

1090
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:25,000
SSJ100Matt says, you can probably buy those devices and armor bonuses in some sort of store in the game.

1091
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:35,000
And BowerCTU says, I want the classic Enterprise. So, you know, screw what I think. No, that's, obviously there will be a lot of people that want it and there'll probably be a lot of them in game.

1092
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:40,000
Because, you know, GameStop is obviously still a very, very big retailer where a lot of people are gonna get this.

1093
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:47,000
But just so you know, there's choices, so if Star Trek Online is really important to you, you might want to think around about where you pre-order the game.

1094
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:51,000
I'll probably end up getting it on Steam so I don't have to go outside the house, but we'll see.

1095
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:59,000
Well, I'm probably gonna get mine on Amazon because I have, thanks to Becky who's already given me one of my presents, I have a $40 gift card.

1096
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:02,000
Woo! Poor GameCrazy though, I didn't see them on the list.

1097
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:04,000
Well...

1098
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:06,000
Maybe they'll get something else, who knows.

1099
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:08,000
No comment.

1100
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:10,000
Alright, moving on to another story, DarkSakura.

1101
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:13,000
Well, in OtherStuff...

1102
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:15,000
Yay, OtherStuff!

1103
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:39,000
Thanks, Rob. PS3 actually won Metacritic's console of the year. They did a big survey on it and actually the higher rated games came out, higher rated games were on Xbox 360 than PS3, but the winner overall was still the PS3.

1104
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:45,000
Which is kind of crap. But then again, Uncharted 2, you know, meh.

1105
01:27:46,000 --> 01:28:07,000
The Wii did okay on the thing too, but I mean, and also though, to keep going further into the list though, the best rated Xbox game was Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2, and Metroid Prime Trilogy was on Wii, Street Fighter IV scored the best for PC, Grand Theft Auto Chinatown Wars was number one on PSP and DS.

1106
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:08,000
So...

1107
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:21,000
Ah, this seems like one of those stories that's just there to start a controversy, you know, to get the PSP fanboys and the... I'm sorry, not PSP, the Sony fanboys and the Microsoft fanboys all riled up.

1108
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:36,000
But you know, it's been a good year for Sony. They've, you know, the price drop was what they needed to do three years ago and it's finally bringing a lot of people on board and I've heard a lot of people talk about how they're probably going to take the plunge and get the PS3 now, you know, with Blu-ray and so forth.

1109
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:43,000
I think they're going to have a really good Christmas season. I mean, we'll see when the numbers come out. Certainly Microsoft's not out. Hell no.

1110
01:28:43,000 --> 01:28:50,000
They've already sold millions of consoles. I think there's going to be a lot of people who just simply have more than one console in this day and age, you know?

1111
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:57,000
So, alright. Let's see, we'll move on to some more news stories and then we'll get to the mailbag in just a minute here.

1112
01:28:57,000 --> 01:29:14,000
Yes. So this is kind of neat. We had a game that just came out, Avatar, that supported 3D with, you know, actually stereoscopic 3D with TVs that supported, you know, 3D gaming. Some of the 120 MHz TVs.

1113
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:16,000
Is that because a movie is supposed to be in 3D too?

1114
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:34,000
Yes, it is. And it's kind of neat though because Avatar actually, it was, it's dependent on which TV it is. They had a bunch of different options that you could do, you know, including Reel-D was one of those, which you find in a lot of the cinemas nowadays, which is the polarized glasses.

1115
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:52,000
Well, now Namco is adopting stereoscopic 3D as well for, they've gotten some 3D development tools and you're going to see these in an upcoming game. An upcoming as yet unannounced Namco Bandai title.

1116
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:54,000
Soulcalibur V.

1117
01:29:55,000 --> 01:29:58,000
I don't know, but it's neat. I mean, I think this is the way games are going to go.

1118
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:00,000
Yeah, but how many TVs are fitted for this?

1119
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:18,000
Not many. And the thing is, not only do you have to have these TVs, you have to have those glasses too. So, the Reel-D wouldn't be bad. If you could do the Reel-D stuff, like, on your TV, I mean, because that's just a, it's polarized glasses. I mean, that's, those glasses cost like five bucks. I mean, that would be, I think, the way to go.

1120
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:35,000
When you get the more expensive, like, shutter glasses, you know, their actual hardware, they have, you know, timing and everything, that might be a little bit difficult. But, I think it's almost like pushing the technology too quick. I mean, we just got people sort of adopted to HDTVs, not everybody's kind of on board with that.

1121
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:40,000
I can't believe this Avatar game's already supporting it. It seems so early. You know, I realize...

1122
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:41,000
I hear it's good though.

1123
01:30:41,000 --> 01:31:03,000
I mean, I hear that Avatar's whole thing is, you know, really pushing what they do with cinema now, but, man. And by the way, TigerClaws, Lincoln, and Chad, apparently, even though I was bagging on the game a little, or on the movie a little bit last week about how I kind of don't look interested in it, Avatar the movie apparently has an 89% on Rotten Tomatoes right now. So, I guess some people are being pretty wowed by it.

1124
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:04,000
By the game?

1125
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:05,000
No, the movie.

1126
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:07,000
The movie? It's not out yet.

1127
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:13,000
Well, it had its premiere in London, so some critics were probably there. It's probably had its critics screening.

1128
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:21,000
Well, I'm going to go see it, and in 3D, because that's the way it's meant to be seen, but if it's crap, then I'll call it.

1129
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:25,000
Are you going to see it by Sunday? Review it on next week's show?

1130
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:31,000
I don't know. I want to go see it with my dad, because the wife does not want to see that movie.

1131
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:37,000
I see. I see. And I think he's gone, so I might not be able to see it. She may go see it, though.

1132
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:40,000
I'm sure some of our chatters will let us know next week, if nothing else.

1133
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:41,000
We're definitely going to see it next week.

1134
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:44,000
I will give you a review of Princess and the Frog next week. I'm going to see that tomorrow.

1135
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:47,000
I want to see that, too. Maybe I'll see that tomorrow.

1136
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:49,000
That you could probably get the wife to see.

1137
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:54,000
She actually, I do remember now, she does want to see Avatar, because she said it looked neat.

1138
01:31:55,000 --> 01:31:56,000
Oh, there you go.

1139
01:31:56,000 --> 01:32:03,000
All right. Let's see. Moving on to another story here about something probably the wife wouldn't be interested in at all.

1140
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:05,000
I don't know, Loki. Maybe she would be.

1141
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:15,000
Bible Adventures is a new game that's coming out from Left Behind Games, which I want to say I remember reporting on the fact that the studio was developed quite some time ago.

1142
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:18,000
And do the Left Behind Game.

1143
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:29,000
So now they're doing Bible Adventures is their new game. It's going to educate young children by teaching them academic lessons vital to early childhood development through Bible stories.

1144
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:33,000
So in other words, it's going to be throwing the Bible at them at an early age.

1145
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:40,000
You know, I could see this maybe being more of like a downloadable game. I mean, that would be a little bit more popular, I think.

1146
01:32:41,000 --> 01:32:42,000
No, it's coming out as an actual game.

1147
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:53,000
I don't want to sell this. It's not that I don't like selling, you know, not that I have anything against the Bible or anything, but I don't want to sell that. I mean, it's like, you need this because people love the Bible.

1148
01:32:54,000 --> 01:33:04,000
Anyway, it's based on the Charlie Churchmouse stories. It's going to span both the Old and the New Testament, and it will teach mathematics, spelling, and I love this, reasoning skills.

1149
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:07,000
WWJD.

1150
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:11,000
I prefer WWTF.

1151
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:16,000
IDGAF. WWJD.

1152
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:28,000
Anyhow, the CEO of Left Behind has said that they expect their financial projections to grow exponentially as they transition from a PC game developer to a Wii and Xbox developer.

1153
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:39,000
That's right. Bible Adventures apparently is coming out for the Wii and the Xbox 360, and I love this. Joystiq, who ran this story, one of the many sites who ran the story this week, said,

1154
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:42,000
But what about PS3 owners? Well, they can go to hell.

1155
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:44,000
And then the link, though.

1156
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:47,000
The link is for Dante's Inferno. I know. I love it. It's funny. I lolled.

1157
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:57,000
You know what, though? Like it or not, there's a market for this stuff. They'll sell these in those Christian bookstores.

1158
01:33:58,000 --> 01:34:01,000
I just want to know when we're getting dance praise or whatever the Guitar Hero equivalent was.

1159
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:03,000
Guitar praise? Yeah, I remember that.

1160
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:06,000
Do I get to hold my hand up like I feel Jesus?

1161
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:08,000
Where's DJ Praise?

1162
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:11,000
DJ Praise? Maybe you should make that game, Loki.

1163
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:13,000
No, I shouldn't.

1164
01:34:13,000 --> 01:34:20,000
Alright, anyhow, forget it. Let's move on to the mailbag. Every week, you guys send us e-mails at Mailbag at OrangeLawnTrader.com,

1165
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:25,000
and DarkSakura jumps into the mailbag head first and instantly deletes them.

1166
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:31,000
But not before she picks out a few of her favorites to read here on the air in a segment we call The Mailbag.

1167
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:34,000
Who's e-mailed us this week?

1168
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:43,000
Starting with an awful joke. So it's from AZHP. Hi, OLR crew. AZHP here celebrating the release of the new Silent Hill Wii game with a crude joke for everyone.

1169
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:45,000
Yay! Yay! Joke!

1170
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:49,000
What do you call what happens to your boobs after Pyramid Head rapes you?

1171
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:52,000
What? Silent Hill shattered mammaries.

1172
01:34:54,000 --> 01:35:00,000
Now that we've got that out of the way, have you guys heard about the Silent Hill stage play plan for Sweden?

1173
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:07,000
Yes, we already did that. If it's as good as the last Konami spinoff play I wrote into the show about DDR the Musical,

1174
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:12,000
then I'm sure we can all say that we're extremely excited to see what comes out of this.

1175
01:35:13,000 --> 01:35:19,000
There aren't any details besides the flyer which has been making the rounds on gaming blogs, but it's Silent Hill, so it's plenty enough to get excited about. Am I right?

1176
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:23,000
TTFN, ta-ta for now. AZHP. Yeah, we covered that.

1177
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:28,000
By the way, AZHP, I got this for you for your joke.

1178
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:34,000
Oh, wait. Sound cue fail. Now this is for me and AZHP.

1179
01:35:39,000 --> 01:35:41,000
We just need to get one of those fancy mixing boards with the buttons.

1180
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:44,000
Yes, we do. We need a fancy mixing board with buttons. Let's get on that.

1181
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:48,000
I will get on that because you already told me what to do.

1182
01:35:49,000 --> 01:35:50,000
Yay.

1183
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:52,000
Next up comes from Gray Fox.

1184
01:35:53,000 --> 01:35:56,000
Dear O.L.R., I need your help.

1185
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:58,000
No. Give me a dollar.

1186
01:35:59,000 --> 01:36:03,000
All of my life I have been in love with Zelda and Final Fantasy series.

1187
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:11,000
Up to this point I have played almost every game in the series, but due to how long it takes to beat those types of games, I find that it seems more like a chore than fun anymore.

1188
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:19,000
I remember the days where I would play these games all day and not think twice.

1189
01:36:19,000 --> 01:36:29,000
Now with so much of my time being taken up by other interests, I find myself having less time for games than finding myself remembering my relentless quests across Hyrule or summoning some ridiculously large beast in Final Fantasy.

1190
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:34,000
So I have asked myself if other people have encountered the same thing.

1191
01:36:35,000 --> 01:36:36,000
Yes.

1192
01:36:37,000 --> 01:36:39,000
Yes. I don't have patience anymore.

1193
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:42,000
I also have life.

1194
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:49,000
I have Gamer ADD. I have told this on the show many, many times. I have the worst case of Gamer ADD and it's not helping my wallet.

1195
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:55,000
I will buy $60 games and I swear to God I play them once and then never play them again. It's a disgusting, filthy habit. I need to stop.

1196
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:58,000
I have a game right over here that I haven't played yet. Rob, you should stay and play it with me sometime.

1197
01:36:59,000 --> 01:37:00,000
Sometime, yeah.

1198
01:37:01,000 --> 01:37:02,000
I have Marvel Ultimate Alliance 2.

1199
01:37:03,000 --> 01:37:04,000
You still haven't played that? You've had that for like two months.

1200
01:37:05,000 --> 01:37:06,000
Well, now my hand works.

1201
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:08,000
Oh yeah, that's right. You got it when you had your hand, drama.

1202
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:13,000
But yeah, actually I was playing through Blue Dragon and put that aside.

1203
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:15,000
You got pretty far in that too.

1204
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:21,000
Lost Odyssey. I've tried Lost Odyssey twice. Although I will blame the second time on my Xbox 360 borking.

1205
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:26,000
I will also blame though that the last time I quit playing Grandia was because I got tired of reading that much Japanese.

1206
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:37,000
To be honest, I've taken a liking to independent games like Bit.Trip Beat and World of Goo because I can usually beat the games within a few weeks.

1207
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:41,000
Which makes me wonder if I'm no different from when I first started playing games like Mario Brothers or Duck Hunt.

1208
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:46,000
So this brings me back to my original question. Am I crazy? Am I thinking too much? Help me out, Gray Fox.

1209
01:37:47,000 --> 01:37:52,000
Dude, just play whatever's fun. If it's not fun, don't play it. Don't force yourself into a mold you don't fit in.

1210
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:59,000
And I think tastes change with time. You know, and maybe it does have something to do with age. I don't know because I had much more patience when I was little.

1211
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:05,000
Because I play some of those 8-bit games now and I don't have the patience to collect everything like I used to when I was a kid.

1212
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:10,000
And there's also a lot of peer pressure out there to be playing certain games, you know, like the popular ones. Like you'd be in the new crowd.

1213
01:38:11,000 --> 01:38:12,000
Like smoking crack the game.

1214
01:38:13,000 --> 01:38:17,000
Yet, yet I spend hours upon hours upon hours on World of War crack. Go figure.

1215
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:20,000
Well there's, I mean some of those are just good though.

1216
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:27,000
But for, I think part of it with an MMO is that because it is something that you can just pick up, play for a little bit and put away.

1217
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:32,000
It has that casual aspect on it unless you're like I guess one of those freaks that goes raiding.

1218
01:38:33,000 --> 01:38:38,000
Hey. I don't go like I used to. Raiding kind of ruined WoW for a little while for me.

1219
01:38:39,000 --> 01:38:41,000
But keep in mind for that, that's also a social aspect.

1220
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:43,000
It is. It is. It really is.

1221
01:38:43,000 --> 01:38:50,000
And for me when I play, I play with like one person.

1222
01:38:51,000 --> 01:38:56,000
I've described World of Warcraft to friends that I have that don't get the Warcraft obsession or you know just are curious about it.

1223
01:38:57,000 --> 01:39:01,000
I will say it's like a chat room with fireballs is World of Warcraft for me.

1224
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:09,000
Yeah. And it's kind of neat because friends I have who might live across the country, it gives us a chance, I know this is going to sound so dorky and nerdy.

1225
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:11,000
I know. I agree with that.

1226
01:39:11,000 --> 01:39:16,000
It gives us a chance to hang out and do something even though yes I understand it's not real life.

1227
01:39:17,000 --> 01:39:20,000
But keep in mind I'm talking about friends that live states and states and thousands of miles away.

1228
01:39:21,000 --> 01:39:24,000
We get to kind of do something together even if it's not you know going outside.

1229
01:39:25,000 --> 01:39:26,000
So take that as you will.

1230
01:39:27,000 --> 01:39:29,000
No. I completely agree with that. I have the same logic about it actually.

1231
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:34,000
So we've got one more email from Jim Sally. What's this? Jim Sally?

1232
01:39:35,000 --> 01:39:36,000
Wait. Jim Sally?

1233
01:39:37,000 --> 01:39:38,000
Jim Sally.

1234
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:43,000
I actually ran home to try to catch the end of it tonight.

1235
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:46,000
He actually said this is the best show ever so I guess he's talking about last week.

1236
01:39:47,000 --> 01:39:49,000
I actually ran home to try to catch the end of it tonight.

1237
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:53,000
Any idea what happened to Dead Pixel Live? Later JS.

1238
01:39:54,000 --> 01:40:04,000
Last week was, we got a lot of compliments on last week's show which is weird because I didn't think we did anything special but talk about more porn than usual so I guess the chatters like porn I don't know.

1239
01:40:05,000 --> 01:40:06,000
I don't even remember what we did.

1240
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:17,000
I don't know the latest update from last week. My thought is they had an epilogue but they're still on the schedule so they're still doing something.

1241
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:25,000
So keep an eye on AllGames.com. I think they have their own website at DeadPixelLive.com and you can check out what's going on there.

1242
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:33,000
I have not heard that they have left the network or anything like that so I don't know if they're just going through some changes over there or what's going on.

1243
01:40:33,000 --> 01:40:36,000
But usually when shows change and stuff I'm like the last to hear about it.

1244
01:40:37,000 --> 01:40:43,000
A Sunday night people are kind of self-sufficient I suppose. They don't keep us in the loop on what's going on the rest of the week. I don't know.

1245
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:46,000
In other news Rob? I still have glue on my fingers.

1246
01:40:47,000 --> 01:40:57,000
I'm sure if something is going on Tigerclaw in our chat will give us an update because he's very good about jumping in with what's going on at AllGames Radio when I'm not as in the loop.

1247
01:40:57,000 --> 01:41:07,000
So there you go. Is that it for emails? Alright so if you have emails you want to send us mailbag at OrangeloungeRadio.com.

1248
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:10,000
Let's get into the FUs of the week.

1249
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:27,000
Music

1250
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:31,000
FU to the situation with my mother. That's all I'm gonna say.

1251
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:35,000
Not to my mother just with the situation.

1252
01:41:35,000 --> 01:41:40,000
Music

1253
01:41:41,000 --> 01:41:47,000
FU to having a cold and Rob I'm just gonna take this moment to say.

1254
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:51,000
There's a couple arcade cabinets and a ranch recorded open for $25 each.

1255
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:59,000
Missing a monitor but they'll sell you a monitor for $50. You can get a Street Fighter 2 cabinet working for $75.

1256
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:01,000
God that's tempting.

1257
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:03,000
Argh!

1258
01:42:03,000 --> 01:42:05,000
And they're in ranches so maybe they'll deliver it to you.

1259
01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:07,000
Maybe I don't know. Sorry.

1260
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:13,000
I don't really have a lot of FUs of the week. I actually had like a really good week all things considered.

1261
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:20,000
So I don't really have a lot of angsty stuff except maybe FU to being exhausted after work on Friday.

1262
01:42:21,000 --> 01:42:24,000
Like I just wanted to go home and die and I did. I slept for an hour so there you go.

1263
01:42:25,000 --> 01:42:31,000
And FU to the rain causing people to drive like crazy. It took twice as long to get here as it usually does.

1264
01:42:31,000 --> 01:42:32,000
Rawr!

1265
01:42:33,000 --> 01:42:36,000
Alright that's gonna do it for the FUs of the week. No story to inspire it tonight.

1266
01:42:37,000 --> 01:42:39,000
Everybody's been fairly well behaved out in the world.

1267
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:43,000
Just a couple more stories and then we'll get to your calls at 1-877-GAME-OLR.

1268
01:42:44,000 --> 01:42:46,000
But first, some more stories. Loki.

1269
01:42:47,000 --> 01:42:53,000
Yes. They had an interesting, or there's gonna be an interesting update coming to Team Fortress 2.

1270
01:42:54,000 --> 01:42:59,000
But what's more interesting than the update itself is how they're deciding who will get the update.

1271
01:42:59,000 --> 01:43:03,000
Apparently the update is either gonna be for the Demoman or the Soldier.

1272
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:12,000
And the way you get to choose, or at least have an impact on who gets the update, is by killing the other class.

1273
01:43:13,000 --> 01:43:20,000
That's right. So starting now, and I forget how long this is running, but I guess during the week,

1274
01:43:21,000 --> 01:43:27,000
you will be able to get the update for the Soldier by becoming the Soldier and killing the Demoman.

1275
01:43:27,000 --> 01:43:32,000
And if you want the Demoman to get the update, you need to go kill the Soldier as the Demoman.

1276
01:43:33,000 --> 01:43:35,000
So, that's kinda neat.

1277
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:40,000
And it's apparently the, of course, the update's called The War.

1278
01:43:42,000 --> 01:43:43,000
That's kinda cool.

1279
01:43:44,000 --> 01:43:50,000
You know, Team Fortress 2 is one of those games that they have done a very good job supporting for quite some time since its release.

1280
01:43:51,000 --> 01:43:52,000
So, there you go.

1281
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:59,000
Yeah, it says, also it says the update will award three new weapons to both the Soldier and Demoman classes.

1282
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:03,000
Weapons will be revealed piecemeal over the course of next week.

1283
01:44:04,000 --> 01:44:08,000
However, two classes will be fighting during the week to unlock a secret fourth weapon for their profession.

1284
01:44:11,000 --> 01:44:15,000
Alright, moving on to one more story and then we'll get to our Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR.

1285
01:44:15,000 --> 01:44:22,000
Hey, this has to do with Borderlands. Of course, this is kinda one of those games, I don't wanna say it's flying under the radar, so to speak,

1286
01:44:23,000 --> 01:44:24,000
but I think it fell off a lot of people's radars.

1287
01:44:25,000 --> 01:44:26,000
It's really sweet. I'm gonna play it this weekend.

1288
01:44:27,000 --> 01:44:29,000
It's doing very good, kinda like, you know, word of mouth and so forth.

1289
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:34,000
And it's getting a second download content. It's called Mad Moxie's Underdome Riot.

1290
01:44:35,000 --> 01:44:37,000
And you can probably just even tell by the name.

1291
01:44:38,000 --> 01:44:40,000
It sounds a lot like it's inspired by Mad Max.

1292
01:44:40,000 --> 01:44:47,000
But what the game will do there is it's actually adding some new Riot mode arenas for single player and co-op.

1293
01:44:48,000 --> 01:44:53,000
There's gonna be a bank where you can store your weapons and the whole thing's gonna cost you 800 Microsoft points,

1294
01:44:54,000 --> 01:44:56,000
or that would be 10 real dollars and that's how much they're charging on the PS3.

1295
01:44:57,000 --> 01:45:00,000
They're saying also it's an entirely new game mode.

1296
01:45:01,000 --> 01:45:06,000
They're comparing it to Smash TV in co-op first person shooter in the Borderlands.

1297
01:45:07,000 --> 01:45:08,000
That does sound kind of awesome.

1298
01:45:08,000 --> 01:45:09,000
So there you go.

1299
01:45:10,000 --> 01:45:12,000
I like that. It's a salacious pop in our chatroom at chat.orangetonshooter.com.

1300
01:45:13,000 --> 01:45:14,000
Calls it a first person looter.

1301
01:45:15,000 --> 01:45:16,000
So there you go.

1302
01:45:17,000 --> 01:45:21,000
Alright, so we're gonna go ahead and open up the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR

1303
01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:24,000
where we will take your calls right now if you want to go ahead and give us a call.

1304
01:45:25,000 --> 01:45:29,000
By the way, I just want to say I followed up in chat to one of the emails

1305
01:45:30,000 --> 01:45:33,000
because I noticed that Derek from Dead Pixel Live was in the all games chat

1306
01:45:34,000 --> 01:45:35,000
while we were getting asked that question on the mailbag.

1307
01:45:35,000 --> 01:45:40,000
And he said that it is coming back at 7.30 on Monday after a brief cancellation.

1308
01:45:41,000 --> 01:45:42,000
So there you go.

1309
01:45:43,000 --> 01:45:44,000
So stay tuned to All Games Radio and check that out.

1310
01:45:45,000 --> 01:45:50,000
And I'm assuming 7.30 is Eastern because I know that show used to come on at like 3.30 Pacific.

1311
01:45:51,000 --> 01:45:54,000
It was kind of early for us over here so I think it's just going to be on at a slightly different time.

1312
01:45:55,000 --> 01:45:56,000
So check that out.

1313
01:45:57,000 --> 01:45:59,000
Alright, and of course for all the ladies you can always check allgames.com

1314
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:01,000
for the latest goings on at All Games Radio.

1315
01:46:02,000 --> 01:46:03,000
Hey, we are getting some calls believe it or not.

1316
01:46:03,000 --> 01:46:04,000
Let's go to the phones and take them.

1317
01:46:05,000 --> 01:46:06,000
Hi, you're on Orange Lawns Radio. Who's this?

1318
01:46:07,000 --> 01:46:09,000
Hi, guys. This is Spazinator.

1319
01:46:10,000 --> 01:46:11,000
Hi, Spazinator. What's on your mind, buddy?

1320
01:46:12,000 --> 01:46:22,000
Yeah, I just want to comment on the little story that this guy said a little while ago about firmware update 3.15 for PS3.

1321
01:46:23,000 --> 01:46:27,000
Yeah, the latest update on PlayStation 3. Have you checked it out? Have you used it? What's up?

1322
01:46:27,000 --> 01:46:38,000
There's a slight pitch with the update. Even though the update on the PlayStation 3 is in place,

1323
01:46:39,000 --> 01:46:47,000
you can't use it for the full use of playing the minis on your PlayStation 3 just yet.

1324
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:52,000
Yeah, we did note earlier when we were covering it that not all the games are playable.

1325
01:46:52,000 --> 01:46:57,000
I guess some of the newer ones and the sprinkling of the old ones you can do, but not all of the new ones.

1326
01:46:58,000 --> 01:47:00,000
I guess they're going to patch that in later or something, right?

1327
01:47:01,000 --> 01:47:07,000
Yeah, exactly. In fact, apart from you guys, a few of all the sites made note of this.

1328
01:47:08,000 --> 01:47:19,000
I guess that I don't have all the details in place just yet, so I didn't want to give out any bad information.

1329
01:47:19,000 --> 01:47:29,000
But I'm guessing that they're going to arrange stuff in such a way on the PlayStation Store

1330
01:47:30,000 --> 01:47:39,000
that make it easier to figure out which ones you keep playing on your PlayStation 3 as opposed to which ones that still haven't been updated.

1331
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:44,000
Well, I'm hoping that they get them all playable before too long. I guess that's the idea, right?

1332
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:51,000
Oh, yeah, really. The one thing I definitely want to get and play is Tetris.

1333
01:47:52,000 --> 01:47:59,000
I know it's available on virtually every console known to man, but Tetris is a classic game.

1334
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:05,000
You buy Pac-Man lots of times for different consoles. It's just one of those classic games you have to have. I understand that.

1335
01:48:06,000 --> 01:48:08,000
Spaznier, let me ask you this, though, because this came up earlier in the show.

1336
01:48:08,000 --> 01:48:13,000
And I'm curious because I know you're a Sony fan and you follow a lot of their stuff. You've been very loyal to them throughout the years.

1337
01:48:14,000 --> 01:48:19,000
A question came up earlier in the show about, you know, PS1 games are playable on your PSP and your PlayStation 3.

1338
01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:25,000
Why aren't PSP games playable on your PlayStation 3? Do you think this is something that Sony should move towards?

1339
01:48:26,000 --> 01:48:33,000
Let's imagine that technically it's possible. Let's just throw the technical aspect out of it. Technically it's possible. Should Sony do it?

1340
01:48:33,000 --> 01:48:50,000
From a consumer standpoint, I'd say hell yeah. However, from a strictly business standpoint, I don't think it would make sense.

1341
01:48:51,000 --> 01:48:59,000
Because I would imagine from a Sony standpoint they would probably lose money, so it doesn't matter how you want to look at it.

1342
01:48:59,000 --> 01:49:09,000
I'm all for playing your games, you know, the PSP games on the PS3, but I, you know, I love things really, you know,

1343
01:49:10,000 --> 01:49:14,000
come through push, come through shove, you know. I really don't see it happening though.

1344
01:49:15,000 --> 01:49:22,000
I don't see it happening either, but it's too bad because I can also see the business standpoint of the fact that where it might not then motivate the sale of systems,

1345
01:49:22,000 --> 01:49:28,000
what it will motivate the sale of is the games. I mean, you know, and all the games that are available right there on the store for digital download,

1346
01:49:29,000 --> 01:49:35,000
there's some stuff I would freaking love to play on the PS3, like the Final Fantasy remakes, even though I don't think those are in the store yet,

1347
01:49:36,000 --> 01:49:40,000
but maybe like the Castlevania game that came out by Konami. You know, there's a lot of games I would love to play on the TV.

1348
01:49:41,000 --> 01:49:48,000
Although, you know, I know I could use a video out cable if I want to do that, but maybe I want the convenience of not having to do all that.

1349
01:49:48,000 --> 01:50:00,000
But, you know, on a somewhat related note, you know, one thing that I think virtually every time you can hear replacer demos would like to see is, you know,

1350
01:50:01,000 --> 01:50:11,000
somehow they really bring back PlayStation 2 back with compatibility. You know, I know the early models, you know, PlayStation 3 had it,

1351
01:50:11,000 --> 01:50:24,000
and they kind of reaped it out, and, you know, yeah, they're trying to tinker with it a little bit with the God of War collection and Call of Duty classics,

1352
01:50:25,000 --> 01:50:31,000
but, you know, I would love to be able to play all my old PlayStation 2 games all over again.

1353
01:50:32,000 --> 01:50:36,000
You know, it's interesting because that rumor kind of comes around every so often about the PlayStation 2 games, you know, being playable on PS3,

1354
01:50:36,000 --> 01:50:42,000
and I seem to remember not that long ago, maybe four or five months ago, we had that Sega leaked memo, remember that,

1355
01:50:43,000 --> 01:50:48,000
that had talked about not just the PlayStation 2 games but the Dreamcast games. Like, whatever happened with that, you know?

1356
01:50:49,000 --> 01:50:53,000
I thought that was something that was supposedly rumored for the end of the year. Maybe, you know, things change, obviously.

1357
01:50:54,000 --> 01:51:00,000
But, I mean, this PlayStation 2 being playable on PS3, this is not the first or the last time this rumor is going to come up.

1358
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:05,000
It seems like it's just a matter of time before software backwards compatibility makes it possible.

1359
01:51:06,000 --> 01:51:09,000
But, anyway, Spaznator, we've got to let you go and get to some more calls, but any quick final thoughts for us?

1360
01:51:10,000 --> 01:51:14,000
Um, nothing. I can't think of. But, you know, thanks for taking my call, though.

1361
01:51:15,000 --> 01:51:18,000
All right, well, thank you. Of course. As always, Spaznator, you take care, buddy.

1362
01:51:19,000 --> 01:51:24,000
And, by the way, speaking of Spaznator, I know he's a big fan of the OLR Club on home, which filled up.

1363
01:51:24,000 --> 01:51:29,000
We maxed it out. 25 people's all you can have, so we got all the invites and that's it. We got a full club out there.

1364
01:51:30,000 --> 01:51:31,000
I can even join.

1365
01:51:32,000 --> 01:51:33,000
I know. Some of you guys didn't even join.

1366
01:51:34,000 --> 01:51:35,000
I don't go home.

1367
01:51:36,000 --> 01:51:38,000
Well, yeah, and sadly, not a lot of people do. We do need to set up a time to actually go on home and have a meeting, so maybe one of these days.

1368
01:51:39,000 --> 01:51:40,000
I'll just have to create Loki's porn hut.

1369
01:51:41,000 --> 01:51:42,000
And I'll kick anybody who doesn't show up.

1370
01:51:43,000 --> 01:51:44,000
I'll just have to create Loki's porn hut.

1371
01:51:45,000 --> 01:51:47,000
You do. You need to make Loki's porn hut. But, for now, we've got another call. Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?

1372
01:51:48,000 --> 01:51:49,000
Hey, hey, it's Ronma.

1373
01:51:50,000 --> 01:51:51,000
Hey, hey, what's up?

1374
01:51:51,000 --> 01:51:57,000
Thanks so much. Couple of things. I'll be on my merry little way. Number one, I just had my 360 replaced yet again.

1375
01:51:58,000 --> 01:51:59,000
Again? What happened?

1376
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:09,000
I got the dreaded disk read error, and because Best Buy screwed up the first time around when exchanging my console, I got it replaced yet again.

1377
01:52:10,000 --> 01:52:16,000
I seem to remember something like this coming up a couple weeks ago about the whole Best Buy shenanigans, so they didn't put up too much of a fight in replacing it for you?

1378
01:52:16,000 --> 01:52:23,000
At first, the woman at the counter kept telling me that, um, it's out of warranty, you've got to send it in.

1379
01:52:24,000 --> 01:52:30,000
I'm having an argument with the telly app, two-year coverage. It was replaced once. I went replaced again. I still have time on it.

1380
01:52:31,000 --> 01:52:41,000
The customer service manager comes over. After she tells security, I attempted to jump over the counter and smack the living daylights out of her, which I'm just standing there looking at her like, what is your problem?

1381
01:52:42,000 --> 01:52:43,000
Wow.

1382
01:52:43,000 --> 01:52:57,000
So the customer service manager says, he had his whole Geek Squad blow it out with compressed air, which is something I already did. He says, take it home. If it works, it works. If not, bring it back and exchange it. So, I now have an Elite sitting on my counter.

1383
01:52:58,000 --> 01:53:00,000
How does blowing out a console fix a DVD drive?

1384
01:53:01,000 --> 01:53:02,000
Well, it works on Nintendo, I don't know.

1385
01:53:03,000 --> 01:53:04,000
I don't know, you tell me.

1386
01:53:05,000 --> 01:53:11,000
Wow. Alright, well, I guess, there you go. They finally got you one though, right?

1387
01:53:11,000 --> 01:53:23,000
Yeah, only thing, yeah. I had to swap out the hard drive. I'm sitting there like, well, I could take the 120-gig hard drive, come home with it, and my roommate would kill me because of all the saves, or I could just take the 60-gig, which I did.

1388
01:53:24,000 --> 01:53:26,000
What else is going on in your gaming world, Rama?

1389
01:53:27,000 --> 01:53:34,000
Not too much. I started back into playing Legend of Zelda Phantom Hourglass because I forgot where I left off at, so I'm starting from scratch.

1390
01:53:35,000 --> 01:53:38,000
Well, sometimes that's what you got to do. You got to start all over.

1391
01:53:38,000 --> 01:53:46,000
Yeah, but don't just hate that. You pick up an RPG after you haven't played it for a long time, and you're like, where the hell was I? Damn it, I have to go all over.

1392
01:53:47,000 --> 01:53:58,000
Yeah, I did that with Lost Odyssey. I was on the second disc or something, and then I went back and played it again. I got all the way to the third disc, and now it's been a few months since I played. If I wanted to go back, I'd probably have to start from the beginning again.

1393
01:53:58,000 --> 01:54:08,000
I will say, though, what little I've played of Dragon Age Origins, I do like, though, that whenever on the loading screen of Dragon Age Origins, it gives you a one-paragraph summary of where you are in the story.

1394
01:54:09,000 --> 01:54:14,000
I thought that was a really smart feature. It kind of reminds you of what's going on. I thought that was pretty cool.

1395
01:54:15,000 --> 01:54:19,000
Well, Rama, if there's nothing else on your mind, then I'll let you go so we can get some more calls, but thanks so much for your call. Okay, buddy?

1396
01:54:19,000 --> 01:54:32,000
I have one thing, and I'll be on my way. I talked about Avatar earlier. I want to let everyone know that a friend of mine, Kyle Hebert, who's a voice actor, he's doing the playable character Ryuk for Avatar the Game for the Wii.

1397
01:54:33,000 --> 01:54:38,000
Well, maybe we'll have to get him on the show. I know there's another voice actor we're trying to get on the show, hopefully in the next couple weeks.

1398
01:54:39,000 --> 01:54:41,000
I will let him know, and let's see what happens with it.

1399
01:54:41,000 --> 01:54:52,000
Awesome. All right, take care, buddy. Later. 877-GAME-OLR, if you want to get through, or our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio. Again, that's 1-877-GAME-OLR.

1400
01:54:53,000 --> 01:55:04,000
Toll-free in the U.S. and Canada, but if you're in another country besides those two, I would really urge you to use Skype because it's free, whereas you get charged for using toll-free numbers in non-North America countries.

1401
01:55:05,000 --> 01:55:06,000
Do we have any last-minute stories tonight, Loki?

1402
01:55:06,000 --> 01:55:20,000
Real quick, a few things on the Xbox 360 hacking scene. The two newer light-on drives that were unhackable before are now able to be dumped through a new method that they've figured out.

1403
01:55:20,000 --> 01:55:36,000
And also, they found out a way to hack Xbox Live Arcade games, and now they can register any game that they have a demo for, thanks to Yaris! Yaris made it possible, so there was some good for that game after all.

1404
01:55:37,000 --> 01:55:39,000
Interesting. So Yaris had some good come out of it after all.

1405
01:55:39,000 --> 01:55:56,000
Of course, it does require that you have a modded homebrew-enabled system, which requires a certain mod chip and a firmware prior to...well, you had to add previously a firmware prior to June of 09, and then you can upgrade it to a modified firmware.

1406
01:55:57,000 --> 01:56:02,000
But of course, that firmware you don't want to go on live with, but it can be possible.

1407
01:56:03,000 --> 01:56:05,000
Interesting. Anything else?

1408
01:56:05,000 --> 01:56:08,000
Uh, Beat Raiders coming to the iPhone. That's kinda neat, I guess.

1409
01:56:09,000 --> 01:56:10,000
Oh, that's the Timbaland game, right?

1410
01:56:11,000 --> 01:56:12,000
Yeah. And, uh...

1411
01:56:13,000 --> 01:56:20,000
Did you hear he collaborated with Miley Cyrus on the new album? Like, that's an odd pairing, isn't it? Timbaland and Miley Cyrus, for real?

1412
01:56:21,000 --> 01:56:22,000
Well, she's trying to become more edgy, I guess.

1413
01:56:23,000 --> 01:56:26,000
I guess. I don't know if I can believe that, but alright.

1414
01:56:29,000 --> 01:56:30,000
Is that it? That's all you got?

1415
01:56:31,000 --> 01:56:32,000
Yeah, that's all I got.

1416
01:56:32,000 --> 01:56:36,000
It was. I mean, when all was said and done, it wasn't a super busy Newsweek, so...

1417
01:56:37,000 --> 01:56:42,000
Dark Soccer, I'm gonna ask you if you have anything last minute, but usually you speak up if you do.

1418
01:56:43,000 --> 01:56:44,000
Ah! I'm not feeling well, Rob.

1419
01:56:45,000 --> 01:56:47,000
I'm sorry. Sorry to hear that. Hope you feel better.

1420
01:56:48,000 --> 01:56:49,000
I'm feeling lightheaded.

1421
01:56:50,000 --> 01:56:51,000
Oh, no. Well, maybe you need to go lie down and take a nap.

1422
01:56:52,000 --> 01:56:52,000
Maybe.

1423
01:56:53,000 --> 01:56:58,000
Well, the good news is, then I suppose for you, is that the show is just about done here. It doesn't look like we're getting any more calls, which...

1424
01:56:58,000 --> 01:57:02,000
There's a lot of shy chatters tonight. We got some people going, should I call in? I don't know.

1425
01:57:03,000 --> 01:57:05,000
And I'm like, well, call in if you have something to say, but the phone's not going off, so...

1426
01:57:06,000 --> 01:57:11,000
Well, the good news is, cause I ordered my pasta for, you know, cause I gotta go on the way home.

1427
01:57:12,000 --> 01:57:13,000
Is that for you and the wife?

1428
01:57:14,000 --> 01:57:19,000
It's for us and our guests that we have. We have our friend that just had their baby back in May.

1429
01:57:20,000 --> 01:57:21,000
Oh, very cool.

1430
01:57:21,000 --> 01:57:30,000
And so, I gotta go over there, but the pasta's not due to be done until 5.20, so that gives us 20 minutes if we want to break out some bayonetta.

1431
01:57:31,000 --> 01:57:32,000
Works for me.

1432
01:57:33,000 --> 01:57:40,000
I have to do that. But we're gonna go ahead and wrap up the show for now. Rama's pointing out in chat, by the way, Sky, Timbaland worked with Utada's first US album.

1433
01:57:41,000 --> 01:57:45,000
I actually know that. I don't hate Utada's first US album.

1434
01:57:45,000 --> 01:57:51,000
Like, I don't think it's like, OMG, greatest thing ever, but it's not bad as a piece of pop music. It's fine.

1435
01:57:52,000 --> 01:57:58,000
I think it was underrated, I think, by a lot of people. But yeah, if you're a fan of Timbaland, Utada's first US album, I'm looking forward to seeing her live.

1436
01:57:59,000 --> 01:58:01,000
That's gonna be a rare opportunity in January, so woohoo!

1437
01:58:02,000 --> 01:58:10,000
Anyhow, we're gonna go around and wrap it up. I know it's a little bit of a short show tonight, but it's been kind of a weird week, and also, right before Christmas, not a lot going on.

1438
01:58:10,000 --> 01:58:15,000
You know, people are just getting ready for the holidays and all that stuff, you know, which actually already started with Hanukkah.

1439
01:58:16,000 --> 01:58:21,000
It kind of kicks off the holiday season, and of course you have all the other stuff, so it really goes on through New Year's Day.

1440
01:58:22,000 --> 01:58:26,000
So things will pick up again as we get into next year and all the crazy releases. Doesn't mean we're going anywhere, though.

1441
01:58:27,000 --> 01:58:33,000
We will be back, of course, live on the 19th next Sunday right after Bobby, our usual time slot. We'll be there doing all that we usually do.

1442
01:58:34,000 --> 01:58:36,000
So now we're gonna go around and get everybody's final thoughts. DarkSakura?

1443
01:58:37,000 --> 01:58:38,000
I'm tired.

1444
01:58:38,000 --> 01:58:40,000
Sorry to hear that. Loki?

1445
01:58:41,000 --> 01:58:53,000
I can't wait to eat the pasta. We got the meaty pasta, and this is a shock, but I'm proud to be married to my wife. She wanted the bacon macaroni and cheese.

1446
01:58:54,000 --> 01:58:55,000
I'm like, yes!

1447
01:58:56,000 --> 01:58:58,000
Yeah, wish your wife a happy Hanukkah for me, by the way. If you wouldn't mind doing that.

1448
01:58:58,000 --> 01:59:08,000
And I guess I don't really have much of a final thought, but hail Godga. That's my final thought. Hail Godga, because it's the whole reason the show's getting screwed up tonight, so appreciate it.

1449
01:59:09,000 --> 01:59:14,000
That's it. Thank you guys so much for tuning into and supporting Orange Lounge Radio. We really appreciate it.

1450
01:59:15,000 --> 01:59:20,000
You know, we do the show for free, and all we ask, if you enjoy what you've heard, tell a friend or two about the show. Help us spread the word.

1451
01:59:21,000 --> 01:59:25,000
Word of mouth's all we got. We don't have a big, big magazine or anything that backs us up. It's just us.

1452
01:59:25,000 --> 01:59:27,000
We do accept donations.

1453
01:59:28,000 --> 01:59:33,000
We will be back, though, next. Yes, donations of money and food. Cookies are good. Macaroons.

1454
01:59:34,000 --> 01:59:36,000
I just gave Rob the last of my macaroons.

1455
01:59:37,000 --> 01:59:42,000
They were delicious, by the way. Anyhow, that's going to do it. Thank you guys so much. We'll do it all again next week on the 19th.

1456
01:59:43,000 --> 01:59:47,000
So, until then, I'm Rob, she's Jamie, he's Loki, and we're gone!
