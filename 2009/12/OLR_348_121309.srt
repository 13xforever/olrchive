00:00:13,902 --> 00:00:24,126
[SPEAKER_02]: Tonight, December 13th, 2009, a retrotastic Mega Man 10 is announced, LittleBigPlanet is about to give Captain Sackboy what famous video game has been adapted for the stage.

2
00:00:31,499 --> 00:00:35,460
[SPEAKER_08]: Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

3
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:41,562
[SPEAKER_08]: We are that program dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.

4
00:00:41,582 --> 00:00:48,485
[SPEAKER_08]: And of course we tape live every Sunday night at All Games Radio, www.allgames.com, right after the Bobby Blackwolf Show.

5
00:00:48,585 --> 00:00:48,985
[SPEAKER_08]: Except...

6
00:00:49,525 --> 00:00:50,445
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, Jamie Summers

7
00:01:17,172 --> 00:01:19,794
[SPEAKER_08]: and I think she said something about a pinball party that she's going to.

8
00:01:20,375 --> 00:01:21,936
[SPEAKER_04]: It's Dan's turn to host the pinball party.

9
00:01:22,096 --> 00:01:22,416
[SPEAKER_08]: I see.

10
00:01:22,817 --> 00:01:29,402
[SPEAKER_04]: So I will be probably running away from it tomorrow night to go probably watch Star Trek with Becky.

11
00:01:29,702 --> 00:01:29,942
[SPEAKER_08]: I see.

12
00:01:29,962 --> 00:01:31,563
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to have a special guest next week though.

13
00:01:31,643 --> 00:01:32,624
[SPEAKER_08]: So it just seems to work out.

14
00:01:32,664 --> 00:01:32,904
[SPEAKER_08]: Really?

15
00:01:32,964 --> 00:01:33,945
[SPEAKER_08]: We have a special guest next week?

16
00:01:33,985 --> 00:01:34,305
[SPEAKER_08]: Who's that?

17
00:01:34,486 --> 00:01:34,786
[SPEAKER_08]: Who dat?

18
00:01:36,190 --> 00:01:37,571
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm wondering if I should spoil the surprise.

19
00:01:38,132 --> 00:01:38,733
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, okay.

20
00:01:39,294 --> 00:01:40,595
[SPEAKER_04]: We are going to have Tiara.

21
00:01:41,156 --> 00:01:41,396
[SPEAKER_08]: Really?

22
00:01:41,416 --> 00:01:42,297
[SPEAKER_08]: She's going to be here next week?

23
00:01:42,438 --> 00:01:42,598
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

24
00:01:42,938 --> 00:01:43,859
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm very excited.

25
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:45,581
[SPEAKER_08]: So am I. Awesome, awesome.

26
00:01:46,182 --> 00:01:48,765
[SPEAKER_08]: Also joining us tonight, say hello to the one and only Techmaster Loki.

27
00:01:48,946 --> 00:01:49,306
[SPEAKER_08]: Hello.

28
00:01:49,326 --> 00:01:50,027
[SPEAKER_08]: How are you doing, Loki?

29
00:01:50,367 --> 00:01:50,808
[SPEAKER_08]: Doing fine.

30
00:01:50,888 --> 00:01:51,709
[SPEAKER_08]: Dingo Digital A320

31
00:02:21,071 --> 00:02:22,172
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

32
00:02:37,027 --> 00:03:00,421
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, but you can actually run, uh, you know, different emulators including, uh, CPS 1 and 2, which are the Capcom Arcade games, uh, MVS, which is the Neo Geo Arcade games, uh, NES, I wanna say Mega Drive, um, I think Game Boy Advance, those are all the default emulators that are, um, actually in the, uh, system itself, but you can load more stuff on later on.

33
00:03:00,722 --> 00:03:02,883
[SPEAKER_04]: I was gonna say it doesn't look like an Australian canine.

34
00:03:04,344 --> 00:03:05,746
[SPEAKER_08]: It doesn't look like it ate a baby either.

35
00:03:06,086 --> 00:03:07,308
[SPEAKER_06]: It did not eat a baby.

36
00:03:07,408 --> 00:03:08,970
[SPEAKER_06]: You can also tune in radio on it.

37
00:03:09,491 --> 00:03:12,194
[SPEAKER_08]: Can you listen to Orange Lounge radio?

38
00:03:12,214 --> 00:03:14,617
[SPEAKER_06]: You can listen to podcasts because it plays MP3s.

39
00:03:14,657 --> 00:03:15,278
[SPEAKER_04]: And it has Linux.

40
00:03:16,238 --> 00:03:17,599
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's based off Linux.

41
00:03:17,699 --> 00:03:18,539
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not positive.

42
00:03:19,059 --> 00:03:20,579
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, no, it's not based off Linux.

43
00:03:20,719 --> 00:03:21,840
[SPEAKER_06]: You can install Linux on it.

44
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:23,600
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sure someone's put Linux on it.

45
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:27,262
[SPEAKER_08]: If they can install Linux on a freaking toaster oven, they can install Linux on that thing.

46
00:03:27,282 --> 00:03:28,102
[SPEAKER_06]: You can install Linux on it.

47
00:03:28,202 --> 00:03:29,762
[SPEAKER_06]: It actually is not based on Linux.

48
00:03:30,543 --> 00:03:36,084
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought it may have been because I know that GP2X, it's another homebrew device.

49
00:03:36,985 --> 00:03:37,465
[SPEAKER_06]: You can do that.

50
00:03:37,625 --> 00:03:39,745
[SPEAKER_06]: And it also outputs to TV, so that's kind of cool.

51
00:03:39,925 --> 00:03:40,406
[SPEAKER_08]: That's pretty cool.

52
00:03:40,606 --> 00:03:41,926
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, how much did one of those suckers cost you?

53
00:03:41,946 --> 00:03:41,926
$80.

54
00:03:42,826 --> 00:03:43,627
[SPEAKER_08]: Wow, that's not bad.

55
00:03:43,727 --> 00:03:44,307
[SPEAKER_08]: And where'd you get it from?

56
00:03:44,887 --> 00:03:46,288
[SPEAKER_06]: and DarkSakura.com.

57
00:04:10,749 --> 00:04:11,630
[SPEAKER_06]: and you can put themes on it.

58
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:13,671
[SPEAKER_06]: In fact, I have a Legend of Zelda theme on mine.

59
00:04:14,572 --> 00:04:18,995
[SPEAKER_06]: It's hard to see, Rob, but you'll have to take a look at it.

60
00:04:19,375 --> 00:04:20,516
[SPEAKER_08]: This is great radio, by the way.

61
00:04:22,458 --> 00:04:25,860
[SPEAKER_08]: It kind of has a crossbar thing going on like a PSP.

62
00:04:27,281 --> 00:04:27,781
[SPEAKER_06]: That's cool.

63
00:04:28,642 --> 00:04:29,062
[SPEAKER_08]: I like that.

64
00:04:29,463 --> 00:04:29,883
[SPEAKER_08]: It's pretty neat.

65
00:04:30,188 --> 00:04:32,249
[SPEAKER_06]: and Jamie is super gluing her fingers together apparently.

66
00:04:32,269 --> 00:04:33,369
[SPEAKER_08]: What the hell is she doing over there?

67
00:04:33,389 --> 00:04:34,850
[SPEAKER_08]: Is she doing arts and crafts during the show?

68
00:04:34,890 --> 00:04:36,290
[SPEAKER_08]: Like I know last week she was crocheting.

69
00:04:36,570 --> 00:04:37,271
[SPEAKER_08]: Now she's gluing.

70
00:04:37,971 --> 00:04:38,751
[SPEAKER_08]: She's trying to fix something.

71
00:04:38,771 --> 00:04:39,391
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, and I forgot.

72
00:04:39,411 --> 00:04:43,853
[SPEAKER_06]: The other thing you can do, it has a built-in microphone so you can actually do dictation or whatever, record yourself.

73
00:04:44,141 --> 00:04:45,402
[SPEAKER_08]: That's kind of interesting.

74
00:04:45,742 --> 00:04:46,062
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

75
00:04:46,222 --> 00:04:48,224
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, there you go.

76
00:04:48,804 --> 00:04:52,646
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, guys, if you are listening to us live on this Saturday, you can join us in our chat room.

77
00:04:52,706 --> 00:04:55,188
[SPEAKER_08]: Chat dot Orange Lounge Radio dot com is the place to be.

78
00:04:55,568 --> 00:05:00,872
[SPEAKER_08]: Or if you're on the Game Surge Network on IRC, you just want to join Channel Pound Orange Lounge.

79
00:05:01,452 --> 00:05:01,912
[SPEAKER_08]: All one word.

80
00:05:02,012 --> 00:05:03,133
[SPEAKER_08]: And that is our chat room.

81
00:05:03,433 --> 00:05:05,675
[SPEAKER_08]: We do use a different room than the all games chatters.

82
00:05:06,515 --> 00:05:06,915
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know why.

83
00:05:06,975 --> 00:05:07,616
[SPEAKER_08]: We just always have.

84
00:05:08,136 --> 00:05:09,397
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a history thing at this point.

85
00:05:09,597 --> 00:05:10,658
[SPEAKER_08]: Kind of tradition, I guess you could say.

86
00:05:11,498 --> 00:05:12,059
[SPEAKER_08]: How was your gaming week?

87
00:05:33,757 --> 00:05:37,739
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, anyhow, now that we're taking care of business live on air, let's get into our gaming weeks.

88
00:05:37,819 --> 00:05:40,981
[SPEAKER_08]: And if DarkSakura's unglued her fingers, I'm going to ask her how her gaming week was.

89
00:05:41,001 --> 00:05:42,221
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got glue all over my fingers still.

90
00:05:42,321 --> 00:05:53,407
[SPEAKER_04]: I was fixing, my cell phone case broke, and the little thing that clips it to my belt snapped off, so I just super glued it back on.

91
00:05:54,147 --> 00:05:56,248
[SPEAKER_04]: Because rubber cement clearly isn't working.

92
00:05:56,808 --> 00:06:00,150
[SPEAKER_04]: And now I've just super glued my fingers, so I'm going to have to go run you some nail polish remover on them.

93
00:06:01,994 --> 00:06:02,494
[SPEAKER_08]: What about gaming?

94
00:06:02,815 --> 00:06:04,396
[SPEAKER_04]: I glued soap to my fingers.

95
00:06:05,296 --> 00:06:06,517
[SPEAKER_08]: She's too busy gluing her fingers together.

96
00:06:06,537 --> 00:06:08,679
[SPEAKER_08]: Apparently she's too busy gluing her fingers together to play games.

97
00:06:08,959 --> 00:06:13,322
[SPEAKER_04]: So I played some World of Warcraft yesterday for like an hour.

98
00:06:14,223 --> 00:06:15,623
[SPEAKER_08]: You've got to like level 10 now, huh?

99
00:06:16,564 --> 00:06:17,885
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a second character at 10 now.

100
00:06:18,105 --> 00:06:18,646
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a character at 15.

101
00:06:20,027 --> 00:06:20,527
[SPEAKER_08]: Moving on up.

102
00:06:20,987 --> 00:06:21,968
[SPEAKER_04]: My goat girl.

103
00:06:22,449 --> 00:06:23,009
[SPEAKER_08]: Fire, Frost, Arcane

104
00:06:47,944 --> 00:06:51,465
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm playing Dark Elf Druid.

105
00:06:52,126 --> 00:06:52,466
[SPEAKER_04]: Dark Elf?

106
00:06:52,486 --> 00:06:52,806
[SPEAKER_04]: What am I saying?

107
00:06:52,826 --> 00:06:53,006
[SPEAKER_04]: Blood Elf.

108
00:06:53,026 --> 00:06:54,026
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not fucking D&D.

109
00:06:54,286 --> 00:06:54,627
[SPEAKER_04]: Or Night Elf.

110
00:06:54,647 --> 00:06:55,227
[SPEAKER_04]: No, Night Elf.

111
00:06:55,287 --> 00:06:55,847
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, gotcha.

112
00:06:55,887 --> 00:06:56,927
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, D&D!

113
00:06:56,967 --> 00:06:59,148
[SPEAKER_08]: It's okay, WoW ripped a lot off from D&D, so it works.

114
00:06:59,248 --> 00:07:01,029
[SPEAKER_04]: Now I'm gonna go pour acetone on my fingers.

115
00:07:01,269 --> 00:07:01,929
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, have fun.

116
00:07:02,409 --> 00:07:04,750
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, Loki, how was your gaming week, besides the dingo?

117
00:07:05,510 --> 00:07:06,251
[SPEAKER_06]: Besides the dingo.

118
00:07:06,531 --> 00:07:10,512
[SPEAKER_06]: I actually played on my arcade cabinet a little bit, because I finally got... It's almost done.

119
00:07:10,852 --> 00:07:13,313
[SPEAKER_06]: The front end's working now.

120
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:20,746
[SPEAKER_06]: The problem is I have too many games listed on there because I have every single game that's been pretty much ever put on MAME on that cabinet.

121
00:07:20,946 --> 00:07:22,628
[SPEAKER_06]: It makes it really hard to find stuff.

122
00:07:22,728 --> 00:07:27,612
[SPEAKER_06]: So I have to go back now and remove stuff off the list that I don't really want to play.

123
00:07:28,093 --> 00:07:29,835
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's going to be a process in itself.

124
00:07:30,035 --> 00:07:32,357
[SPEAKER_06]: So, yeah, fun.

125
00:07:32,877 --> 00:07:34,079
[SPEAKER_06]: But I did play a little bit of...

126
00:07:35,031 --> 00:07:35,711
[SPEAKER_06]: What did I play on there?

127
00:07:35,731 --> 00:07:37,292
[SPEAKER_06]: I was testing it out.

128
00:07:37,792 --> 00:07:39,873
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, just some random Neo Geo games and stuff.

129
00:07:40,214 --> 00:07:40,814
[SPEAKER_06]: It works really well.

130
00:07:42,055 --> 00:07:44,936
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I've been playing Bayonetta.

131
00:07:45,236 --> 00:07:49,939
[SPEAKER_06]: I finally broke out my Japanese 360 and that game is all sorts of awesome.

132
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:52,461
[SPEAKER_06]: I love it because it's...

133
00:08:09,242 --> 00:08:15,126
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not quality, it's quantity, and he starts throwing tons of pistols at her, and it's just absolutely ridiculous.

134
00:08:15,246 --> 00:08:16,227
[SPEAKER_08]: Wait, is it dubbed in English?

135
00:08:16,647 --> 00:08:17,608
[SPEAKER_06]: It's all in English.

136
00:08:17,668 --> 00:08:17,928
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, nice.

137
00:08:17,948 --> 00:08:18,869
[SPEAKER_06]: The entire game is in English.

138
00:08:18,889 --> 00:08:27,014
[SPEAKER_08]: So you didn't play, I just played the demo, which was a selected stage from the game apparently, but you actually have the full Japanese one.

139
00:08:27,034 --> 00:08:28,055
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I have the full game.

140
00:08:28,115 --> 00:08:29,535
[SPEAKER_06]: It's absolutely all in English.

141
00:08:31,130 --> 00:08:32,792
[SPEAKER_06]: and DarkSakura.com

142
00:08:56,091 --> 00:08:59,072
[SPEAKER_06]: I love the Joe Pesci type character.

143
00:08:59,172 --> 00:09:01,173
[SPEAKER_06]: It's Joe Pesci, but not Joe Pesci.

144
00:09:02,694 --> 00:09:04,094
[SPEAKER_06]: My favorite character in the game.

145
00:09:05,895 --> 00:09:08,136
[SPEAKER_06]: Just everything about the game is so over the top, though.

146
00:09:08,276 --> 00:09:12,577
[SPEAKER_06]: Seriously, it gives her new red pistols or whatever that are in the game.

147
00:09:13,017 --> 00:09:19,540
[SPEAKER_06]: And there's this sequence where the guy's mixing a drink and she's putting on the pistols in the most...

148
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:22,961
[SPEAKER_06]: I hate Devil May Cry.

149
00:09:23,201 --> 00:09:23,761
[SPEAKER_06]: I hate it.

150
00:09:23,801 --> 00:09:25,722
[SPEAKER_06]: But this game is awesome.

151
00:09:26,363 --> 00:09:26,703
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just...

152
00:09:47,976 --> 00:09:50,157
[SPEAKER_08]: This is totally one of those games I never thought I would like.

153
00:09:50,597 --> 00:09:54,118
[SPEAKER_08]: Just kind of looking at screenshots where you don't really see the game in motion, you're kind of like, oh, yeah.

154
00:09:54,158 --> 00:09:55,579
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, I have a proposal for you then.

155
00:09:56,179 --> 00:10:03,282
[SPEAKER_04]: Sometime in the next weeks or so, you should totally just bring it over and the three of us should just play through it.

156
00:10:03,842 --> 00:10:04,382
[SPEAKER_08]: That'd be fun.

157
00:10:04,402 --> 00:10:05,162
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe tape it or something.

158
00:10:05,182 --> 00:10:06,243
[SPEAKER_06]: I have it in my car.

159
00:10:06,463 --> 00:10:06,983
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you really?

160
00:10:07,043 --> 00:10:08,023
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I have it in my car.

161
00:10:08,164 --> 00:10:12,865
[SPEAKER_06]: In fact, I got to order pizza, or not pizza, but Pizza Hut pasta after the show.

162
00:10:12,905 --> 00:10:14,846
[SPEAKER_06]: And since we're going to be wrapped up, you know,

163
00:10:16,024 --> 00:10:18,945
[SPEAKER_08]: We have to be done before 5 Pacific because I think the next All Games program is at 5.

164
00:10:19,405 --> 00:10:24,487
[SPEAKER_06]: So since we're going to be done before then, what I thought, we might have a chance to play it for a few minutes.

165
00:10:25,607 --> 00:10:27,608
[SPEAKER_08]: Might be something we do after the show.

166
00:10:27,668 --> 00:10:29,128
[SPEAKER_08]: Too bad I don't have my video camera.

167
00:10:29,148 --> 00:10:30,009
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll figure something out.

168
00:10:30,049 --> 00:10:32,669
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm trying to think what else I played this week.

169
00:10:33,009 --> 00:10:37,431
[SPEAKER_06]: Still no Borderlands yet, but I'm hoping to break into that tomorrow night.

170
00:10:37,831 --> 00:10:40,212
[SPEAKER_06]: Unfortunately I got distracted by Bayonetta.

171
00:10:40,612 --> 00:10:43,893
[SPEAKER_06]: And then of course more Grand Theft Auto because that's what we play every day.

172
00:10:44,113 --> 00:10:44,293
[SPEAKER_06]: So

173
00:10:46,427 --> 00:11:14,172
[SPEAKER_06]: it's really sad though there's not a lot of people online playing Grand Theft Auto at least not the Ballad of Gay Tony multiplayer man there's like times where we'll be playing ranked matches where we can't get more than four people in and those four people are us it's so slow that we can get into the same ranked game easy now but I don't know talk to Dan at some point while he's off work I'm sure he'll play with you guys

174
00:11:15,862 --> 00:11:17,463
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

175
00:11:37,802 --> 00:11:45,005
[SPEAKER_08]: Umlaut happened this Wednesday, and I actually trekked out over to the Bay Area to check it out, and it was cool.

176
00:11:45,065 --> 00:11:46,566
[SPEAKER_08]: It was a fun little event.

177
00:11:46,886 --> 00:11:50,528
[SPEAKER_08]: It wasn't super crowded, but it definitely wasn't a bad turnout.

178
00:11:50,848 --> 00:11:57,891
[SPEAKER_08]: It was tolerable, the amount of people in what is a much smaller club than you'd probably think if you're looking at some of those videos online of some of the bands.

179
00:11:58,211 --> 00:12:03,213
[SPEAKER_08]: Of course, the whole catch was that people would pay money to get up on stage and play rock band in a

180
00:12:03,794 --> 00:12:04,695
[SPEAKER_08]: and DarkSakura.com.

181
00:12:19,062 --> 00:12:19,782
[SPEAKER_08]: Great charity.

182
00:12:19,862 --> 00:12:22,704
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's kind of hard to say no to something like that.

183
00:12:22,724 --> 00:12:23,624
[SPEAKER_08]: In fact, I wanted to do it.

184
00:12:23,644 --> 00:12:27,646
[SPEAKER_08]: I just didn't have – with Jamie and Loki not being able to go, I just didn't have enough people to do the band.

185
00:12:27,666 --> 00:12:29,526
[SPEAKER_06]: I completely forgot about it until I saw the tweet on it.

186
00:12:29,586 --> 00:12:30,947
[SPEAKER_06]: Damn you.

187
00:12:31,087 --> 00:12:32,568
[SPEAKER_06]: That was today, wasn't it?

188
00:12:32,708 --> 00:12:33,128
[SPEAKER_08]: That's all right.

189
00:12:33,368 --> 00:12:34,849
[SPEAKER_08]: We still wouldn't have had enough people.

190
00:12:36,189 --> 00:12:36,950
[SPEAKER_08]: and DarkSakura.com.

191
00:12:52,839 --> 00:12:53,980
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com

192
00:13:20,654 --> 00:13:25,978
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it was his sister or niece and like her friends or something.

193
00:13:26,899 --> 00:13:27,399
[SPEAKER_08]: It was fun.

194
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:29,521
[SPEAKER_04]: I think his niece used to do freestyle with him too.

195
00:13:29,963 --> 00:13:31,444
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it was cool.

196
00:13:32,305 --> 00:13:43,134
[SPEAKER_08]: So, you know, they didn't have a lot set up as far as games because you just had the stage, which you had to pay to be on, or in the back, they had Beatles Rock Band, which actually had the new content.

197
00:13:43,354 --> 00:13:45,035
[SPEAKER_08]: But they had a lot of support from Harmonix.

198
00:13:45,856 --> 00:13:49,239
[SPEAKER_08]: And, you know, they had tons and tons of just loot.

199
00:13:49,739 --> 00:13:56,905
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, you know, you pay $10 to get in the door, which technically you don't have to do because it's a $10 suggested donation.

200
00:13:56,965 --> 00:13:58,886
[SPEAKER_08]: But since the whole thing's charity, if you don't pay $10...

201
00:13:59,887 --> 00:14:00,788
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

202
00:14:27,168 --> 00:14:31,850
[SPEAKER_08]: And they had all sorts of just random shit on these loot tables.

203
00:14:32,190 --> 00:14:37,252
[SPEAKER_08]: Like PlayStation 1 games, Super Nintendo games I saw on there.

204
00:14:37,532 --> 00:14:39,793
[SPEAKER_08]: Like a calendar for Bayonetta I was looking at.

205
00:14:40,073 --> 00:14:42,775
[SPEAKER_08]: Like a lot of those promo type things you would see at E3.

206
00:14:43,175 --> 00:14:46,396
[SPEAKER_08]: Like the types of E3 swag all like dumped out on the table.

207
00:14:46,716 --> 00:14:47,997
[SPEAKER_08]: So I walked out of there with a...

208
00:14:48,697 --> 00:14:51,879
[SPEAKER_08]: Plug and Play Intellivision Part 2.

209
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:53,920
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a little controller.

210
00:14:54,301 --> 00:14:58,964
[SPEAKER_08]: The second one they've released, apparently, with 10 Intellivision games, I guarantee you've never heard of.

211
00:14:59,684 --> 00:15:00,985
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, except Jamie, because she's crazy.

212
00:15:01,265 --> 00:15:01,726
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I know.

213
00:15:02,726 --> 00:15:04,908
[SPEAKER_08]: But, you know, I walked out of there with that.

214
00:15:04,948 --> 00:15:10,051
[SPEAKER_08]: My friend, who I went with, Alan, he walked out of there with a copy of Advance Force 2 for Game Boy Advance.

215
00:15:10,291 --> 00:15:13,413
[SPEAKER_08]: So just all this, like, cool stuff on the loot table, it was kind of rad.

216
00:15:13,834 --> 00:15:16,175
[SPEAKER_08]: So, I mean, it was all donated to a great cause.

217
00:15:16,395 --> 00:15:18,037
[SPEAKER_08]: And then they had a silent auction going on.

218
00:15:18,957 --> 00:15:24,162
[SPEAKER_08]: which I know they gave away a very limited edition signed like

219
00:15:26,953 --> 00:15:30,035
[SPEAKER_08]: Space Invaders thing of which I think only 180 exist.

220
00:15:30,475 --> 00:15:33,338
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that thing went for like several thousand dollars.

221
00:15:34,098 --> 00:15:35,820
[SPEAKER_08]: They gave away like a stuffed thing from Lost Planet.

222
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:38,322
[SPEAKER_08]: I won one of the silent auctions.

223
00:15:39,002 --> 00:15:46,028
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't want to talk about it on the show because part of it's going to be a Christmas present for someone and even though I don't think they listen I just don't want to talk about it on the show.

224
00:15:46,608 --> 00:15:51,111
[SPEAKER_08]: And if you figure it out please don't spread word out because it's somebody's Christmas present.

225
00:15:51,972 --> 00:15:54,094
[SPEAKER_08]: But I did win one of the auctions and you know what's funny?

226
00:15:55,305 --> 00:15:56,045
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

227
00:16:19,476 --> 00:16:21,376
[SPEAKER_08]: This guy named SHDragon left a comment.

228
00:16:21,777 --> 00:16:22,697
[SPEAKER_08]: Other fun things.

229
00:16:22,937 --> 00:16:27,678
[SPEAKER_08]: I lost the blank auction because the guy I was bid warring against was camping the clipboard.

230
00:16:28,098 --> 00:16:28,418
[SPEAKER_08]: Boo.

231
00:16:28,758 --> 00:16:29,998
[SPEAKER_08]: I can't believe that went for only $100.

232
00:16:30,038 --> 00:16:32,919
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh well, I didn't really have the money to spend anyway.

233
00:16:33,399 --> 00:16:34,319
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just kind of funny.

234
00:16:34,419 --> 00:16:36,700
[SPEAKER_08]: First off, I wasn't camping the clipboard.

235
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:41,701
[SPEAKER_08]: We just happened to be sitting in that back corner right by where the silent auction was, me and Alan and a couple guys.

236
00:16:41,941 --> 00:16:47,422
[SPEAKER_08]: But I did think, I will admit, yeah, I was going to go up there at $10.29 and make sure I was the highest bidder come $10.30, of course.

237
00:16:47,442 --> 00:16:47,522
[SPEAKER_08]: What?

238
00:16:48,442 --> 00:16:48,482
[SPEAKER_08]: A.B.

239
00:16:48,522 --> 00:16:48,763
[SPEAKER_08]: Tactics A.B.

240
00:16:48,803 --> 00:16:48,963
[SPEAKER_08]: Tactics

241
00:16:58,693 --> 00:17:26,448
[SPEAKER_08]: and it worked out and actually I got it for $90 not $100 so and it really it was a steal it was it was absolutely a steal and it should have gone for much more especially for such a good cause however $100 was about the most I was going to spend on this because I just you know even though it's for a good cause look I got to live too and got money and everything so you know that was probably about the most I was going to bid on it and I'm in turn giving half of it to somebody else so and I'll explain more about what that is after it gets given to the individual so

242
00:17:28,256 --> 00:17:29,276
[SPEAKER_08]: That was my experience at Umlaut.

243
00:17:29,316 --> 00:17:30,097
[SPEAKER_08]: Overall, very good.

244
00:17:30,437 --> 00:17:31,718
[SPEAKER_08]: I wish I could have stayed for more of it.

245
00:17:31,738 --> 00:17:32,919
[SPEAKER_08]: I wish I could have got up on stage.

246
00:17:33,559 --> 00:17:34,240
[SPEAKER_08]: But maybe next year.

247
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:36,722
[SPEAKER_08]: I have heard it is confirmed again for next year.

248
00:17:36,882 --> 00:17:38,423
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not sure if it's the same venue or what have you.

249
00:17:38,743 --> 00:17:41,205
[SPEAKER_08]: But honestly, if you guys haven't already...

250
00:17:42,806 --> 00:17:43,607
[SPEAKER_08]: I haven't played that yet.

251
00:17:59,363 --> 00:18:00,083
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I downloaded it.

252
00:18:00,123 --> 00:18:08,066
[SPEAKER_08]: Sexy Bitch, or no, it's Sexy Chick, I think they renamed it, and When Love Takes Over, which is weird because that's download pack.

253
00:18:08,226 --> 00:18:09,207
[SPEAKER_08]: The songs aren't mixed.

254
00:18:09,567 --> 00:18:17,070
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just the one song, but they're like remixes of the song, I'm sure, that are available on a CD, remix CD somewhere, I'm sure, or vinyl.

255
00:18:17,590 --> 00:18:18,350
[SPEAKER_08]: But it was cool.

256
00:18:18,830 --> 00:18:21,391
[SPEAKER_08]: One of them has a crap ton of crossfading in it.

257
00:18:21,832 --> 00:18:23,492
[SPEAKER_08]: And I have to admit, I actually kind of like the songs.

258
00:18:23,832 --> 00:18:27,814
[SPEAKER_08]: So even though one of them had dudes from the Black Eyed Peas, which usually is one of those bands you're like, ugh.

259
00:18:28,294 --> 00:18:30,615
[SPEAKER_07]: They're so played out.

260
00:18:30,715 --> 00:18:35,758
[SPEAKER_07]: If I hear that goddamn song at the club one more time, I got a feeling.

261
00:18:37,079 --> 00:18:39,761
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, oh my god, if I hear that at the club one more time, I'm going to poke my eye out.

262
00:18:40,141 --> 00:18:41,942
[SPEAKER_08]: But I got to admit, that one song was pretty cool.

263
00:18:41,962 --> 00:18:43,763
[SPEAKER_03]: Do it on camera so we can put it on YouTube.

264
00:18:43,823 --> 00:18:44,503
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, fine.

265
00:18:44,924 --> 00:18:48,306
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, anyhow, let's get into some housekeeping real quick.

266
00:18:48,406 --> 00:18:49,486
[SPEAKER_08]: Again, we're pre-taping.

267
00:18:49,526 --> 00:18:55,850
[SPEAKER_08]: If you're just joining us on All Games Radio on Saturday, that's because we're pre-taping or pre-recording, whatever you want to call it,

268
00:18:56,110 --> 00:18:58,632
[SPEAKER_08]: We're doing a pre-thing for our Sunday, the 13th.

269
00:18:58,733 --> 00:19:00,634
[SPEAKER_08]: This will rebroadcast again on Sunday.

270
00:19:00,914 --> 00:19:08,701
[SPEAKER_08]: If you're listening live on Sunday, sorry we are not live, but we do hope you'll send us an email or a tweet or something to tell us what you thought about tonight's show.

271
00:19:08,742 --> 00:19:11,604
[SPEAKER_08]: And of course, the podcasters, well, you're used to getting this on the feed anyway.

272
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:19,091
[SPEAKER_08]: Also, join our Facebook at facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio or our Twitter, twitter.com slash OLR.

273
00:19:19,131 --> 00:19:22,414
[SPEAKER_08]: We always post little updates, especially if there is going to be weird things like

274
00:19:23,995 --> 00:19:26,517
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, gaming news.

275
00:19:26,777 --> 00:19:30,720
[SPEAKER_08]: Believe it or not, even though we're only a couple weeks out before Christmas, there's been quite a little bit of it.

276
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:32,001
[SPEAKER_08]: So let's get into some gaming news.

277
00:19:32,441 --> 00:19:33,742
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, oh, Loki.

278
00:19:34,503 --> 00:19:36,664
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki wants to do this during housekeeping tonight.

279
00:19:36,804 --> 00:19:37,365
[SPEAKER_06]: Real quick.

280
00:19:37,565 --> 00:19:37,885
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

281
00:19:37,965 --> 00:19:43,990
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki has brought Christmas presents or Hanukkah presents, I suppose, if you will, at an appropriate time.

282
00:19:44,370 --> 00:19:50,955
[SPEAKER_06]: I had to bring him over because the cat was starting to eye him up because she likes ribbons and paper and stuff and she'll start ripping into it.

283
00:19:51,035 --> 00:19:55,376
[SPEAKER_08]: And don't I feel like a douchebag because, like, you know, Loki's brought this so early and I don't have his present here.

284
00:19:55,476 --> 00:19:57,237
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I don't do my shopping until Christmas Eve.

285
00:19:57,277 --> 00:19:57,797
[SPEAKER_06]: I really don't.

286
00:19:57,877 --> 00:19:59,898
[SPEAKER_06]: I did my shopping all this week pretty much.

287
00:19:59,938 --> 00:20:00,178
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

288
00:20:00,438 --> 00:20:02,679
[SPEAKER_04]: I do my shopping afterwards so I get it all on sale.

289
00:20:03,059 --> 00:20:03,239
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

290
00:20:03,259 --> 00:20:04,539
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, ladies first.

291
00:20:04,579 --> 00:20:05,879
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, you can open your gift.

292
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:08,600
[SPEAKER_08]: So, DarkSakura, this is great radio.

293
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:09,381
[SPEAKER_08]: They're wrapped in gold.

294
00:20:09,501 --> 00:20:10,701
[SPEAKER_08]: Surely the wife must have done this.

295
00:20:11,021 --> 00:20:11,801
[SPEAKER_06]: The wife was wrapped in gold.

296
00:20:11,861 --> 00:20:13,422
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm like, there's no way.

297
00:20:13,842 --> 00:20:16,163
[SPEAKER_08]: There's no way Loki did this wrapping himself.

298
00:20:16,183 --> 00:20:17,223
[SPEAKER_06]: I did no wrapping of that.

299
00:20:17,583 --> 00:20:25,390
[SPEAKER_08]: Going to our chat room at chat.orangelongeradio.com Toagak says, If you ever lose an episode of OLR, I'm archiving the live editions for you.

300
00:20:25,530 --> 00:20:26,471
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, manga!

301
00:20:27,031 --> 00:20:27,491
[SPEAKER_08]: What'd you get?

302
00:20:27,932 --> 00:20:29,513
[SPEAKER_08]: Return to Labyrinth manga.

303
00:20:29,533 --> 00:20:30,234
[SPEAKER_08]: That's awesome.

304
00:20:30,514 --> 00:20:31,535
[SPEAKER_04]: Sweet!

305
00:20:31,635 --> 00:20:32,916
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh my god, that's super cool.

306
00:20:32,936 --> 00:20:34,357
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm gonna read the hell out of this.

307
00:20:34,437 --> 00:20:35,038
[SPEAKER_08]: That's great.

308
00:20:35,458 --> 00:20:39,101
[SPEAKER_06]: And dude, it's like... You gotta open the big one first.

309
00:20:39,121 --> 00:20:40,783
[SPEAKER_08]: I gotta open the big one first before the little one.

310
00:20:40,803 --> 00:20:41,783
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, you got it.

311
00:20:42,104 --> 00:20:43,545
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm gonna open the big one first.

312
00:20:44,726 --> 00:20:45,667
[SPEAKER_08]: This is a big...

313
00:20:46,775 --> 00:20:47,596
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for watching!

314
00:21:09,087 --> 00:21:10,748
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

315
00:21:41,052 --> 00:21:41,712
[SPEAKER_00]: Fuck yeah!

316
00:21:41,813 --> 00:21:43,614
[SPEAKER_00]: Guardian Legend, motherfucker!

317
00:21:43,634 --> 00:21:44,674
[SPEAKER_00]: There he goes.

318
00:21:44,915 --> 00:21:45,375
[SPEAKER_00]: Batteries.

319
00:21:45,495 --> 00:21:46,215
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh my god.

320
00:21:46,636 --> 00:21:47,076
[SPEAKER_08]: Awesome.

321
00:21:47,176 --> 00:21:48,157
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, hold on.

322
00:21:48,677 --> 00:21:49,337
[SPEAKER_08]: This is great radio.

323
00:21:49,358 --> 00:21:50,398
[SPEAKER_08]: So, awesome.

324
00:21:50,418 --> 00:21:51,059
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, you're the best.

325
00:21:51,079 --> 00:21:51,559
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't worry about it.

326
00:21:51,579 --> 00:21:53,400
[SPEAKER_08]: Take the Guardian Legends wherever you go.

327
00:21:53,420 --> 00:21:56,162
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, so DarkSakura's gonna put these on the website or on the Twitter?

328
00:21:56,182 --> 00:21:57,003
[SPEAKER_04]: On the website.

329
00:21:57,043 --> 00:21:57,523
[SPEAKER_08]: On the website.

330
00:21:57,583 --> 00:21:58,323
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, whoa.

331
00:21:58,444 --> 00:21:58,984
[SPEAKER_08]: Batteries fell.

332
00:21:59,004 --> 00:21:59,584
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, the batteries.

333
00:21:59,604 --> 00:22:00,125
[SPEAKER_08]: But here you go.

334
00:22:00,625 --> 00:22:01,606
[SPEAKER_08]: Taking a picture live there.

335
00:22:01,626 --> 00:22:04,788
[SPEAKER_08]: There's my FC Mobile and copy of Guardian Legend.

336
00:22:04,808 --> 00:22:05,348
[SPEAKER_08]: Did you get that?

337
00:22:05,788 --> 00:22:05,988
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.

338
00:22:06,129 --> 00:22:06,549
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, cool.

339
00:22:07,489 --> 00:22:08,530
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't even know how I found those.

340
00:22:08,570 --> 00:22:12,813
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't even remember what I was looking for, but I somehow came across them.

341
00:22:12,873 --> 00:22:13,554
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, hey...

342
00:22:31,843 --> 00:22:35,165
[SPEAKER_08]: No, yeah, DarkSakura would... Oh my god, if I'd found those, I would have bought them for her too.

343
00:22:35,185 --> 00:22:36,345
[SPEAKER_04]: Remember what the movie's called?

344
00:22:37,085 --> 00:22:39,747
[SPEAKER_04]: It's, you know, Labyrinth guest star David Bowie's package.

345
00:22:40,587 --> 00:22:44,749
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm sorry, this is prettier than David Bowie has ever been, and David Bowie is pretty.

346
00:22:45,458 --> 00:22:52,680
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, well now that I'm in a super duper happy mood, part of me wants to turn this on during the break or something.

347
00:22:52,940 --> 00:22:54,000
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to get this up and going.

348
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:55,381
[SPEAKER_08]: Dude, FC Mobile, yeah.

349
00:22:55,421 --> 00:22:57,621
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to go out and buy NES games like crazy.

350
00:22:57,921 --> 00:23:01,982
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyhow, now I can support portable gaming with this.

351
00:23:02,262 --> 00:23:02,643
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you really?

352
00:23:03,203 --> 00:23:04,703
[SPEAKER_08]: I can support portable games with this.

353
00:23:05,583 --> 00:23:07,044
[SPEAKER_08]: The hell with the DS and the PSP.

354
00:23:07,084 --> 00:23:08,424
[SPEAKER_08]: I got an FC Mobile, y'all.

355
00:23:09,024 --> 00:23:11,045
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, getting into some gaming news tonight.

356
00:23:11,085 --> 00:23:11,825
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki, start us off.

357
00:23:12,957 --> 00:23:26,389
[SPEAKER_06]: So you may remember that a little bit ago, no doubt, and I believe Courtney Love tried suing Activision for the likenesses of Kurt Cobain and, of course, no doubt, in Band Hero more recently.

358
00:23:28,030 --> 00:23:34,274
[SPEAKER_06]: However, Activision has responded to No Doubt's claim by countersuing them.

359
00:23:35,214 --> 00:23:45,920
[SPEAKER_06]: Basically, their main response is that the band's request that their likenesses be limited to performing only the band's own songs in-game was made.

360
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:50,923
[SPEAKER_06]: However, it was requested only after the band hero programming was finalized.

361
00:23:51,912 --> 00:23:56,335
[SPEAKER_06]: This is a gigantic bitch slap to one of the biggest bans in the last few years.

362
00:23:56,355 --> 00:23:56,495
[SPEAKER_06]: This...

363
00:24:15,232 --> 00:24:19,156
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, for me, I think it's just kind of retarded that Activision's doing it.

364
00:24:19,196 --> 00:24:25,602
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I understand that, you know, they had an agreement in place and apparently, you know, somebody didn't read the contract close enough or whatever.

365
00:24:26,223 --> 00:24:30,487
[SPEAKER_06]: And so, you know, they want their money back or they want, you know, the patch to this game.

366
00:24:30,527 --> 00:24:35,311
[SPEAKER_06]: But they can't, at least they can't on, you know, Wii and PlayStation 2 and that kind of stuff.

367
00:24:35,371 --> 00:24:36,592
[SPEAKER_06]: But, um...

368
00:24:37,293 --> 00:24:44,776
[SPEAKER_06]: And at the same time, now I'm wondering if this is going to prevent them from having other bands in the game going forward.

369
00:24:44,896 --> 00:24:45,836
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a theory about this.

370
00:24:46,176 --> 00:24:46,457
[SPEAKER_08]: Go ahead.

371
00:24:46,717 --> 00:24:57,881
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that the logic behind this would be, okay, well, we countersue you to where, you know, if we've got to make all this content change, then we want our money back, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

372
00:24:58,421 --> 00:25:02,523
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's actually going to end up in some kind of closed-doors deal.

373
00:25:02,543 --> 00:25:03,183
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

374
00:25:03,343 --> 00:25:06,186
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sure it will, but they can't make the content change.

375
00:25:06,246 --> 00:25:10,350
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, you can't just... And I've seen this going around on Twitter, is that why don't they just patch it in?

376
00:25:10,390 --> 00:25:11,892
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, you can't patch to the Wii.

377
00:25:12,212 --> 00:25:15,535
[SPEAKER_08]: They have no system of patching on the Wii, and you can't patch to the PS2.

378
00:25:16,116 --> 00:25:19,159
[SPEAKER_08]: So you would have games... The damage is done, period.

379
00:25:19,239 --> 00:25:20,200
[SPEAKER_08]: You can't go back and fix it.

380
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:24,845
[SPEAKER_06]: And you would have people complaining, hey, you're removing content from the game, you know, what the hell...

381
00:25:26,645 --> 00:25:31,569
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe I want, no doubt, to sing some stupid song because it's funny and I enjoy that.

382
00:25:31,749 --> 00:25:34,712
[SPEAKER_06]: And you're removing that ability for a game that I paid for.

383
00:25:35,192 --> 00:25:39,636
[SPEAKER_08]: To me, the countersuit just seems like a we fucking mean it kind of thing.

384
00:25:39,716 --> 00:25:41,818
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, you guys are wrong and we fucking mean it.

385
00:25:42,258 --> 00:25:44,700
[SPEAKER_08]: To me, this seems like they want to recoup their legal fees.

386
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:45,240
[SPEAKER_08]: That's it.

387
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:50,385
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think they honestly would expect to win the whole thing, but I would think it's just legal fees.

388
00:25:50,745 --> 00:25:53,387
[SPEAKER_08]: That they see this as a quote-unquote frivolous lawsuit.

389
00:25:53,407 --> 00:26:04,596
[SPEAKER_06]: And I do see them winning this, actually, because the reason why is if they have them signed to a contract that agrees that their likenesses can be used in this fashion, there's not really much they can do.

390
00:26:04,676 --> 00:26:08,078
[SPEAKER_06]: They can bitch and moan about it, saying, well, I didn't realize it was going to be this.

391
00:26:08,659 --> 00:26:11,001
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, maybe you should have fucking read the contract closer then.

392
00:26:11,721 --> 00:26:13,322
[SPEAKER_06]: Same with the whole Kurt Cobain thing.

393
00:26:13,362 --> 00:26:21,529
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it's tragic, but maybe you shouldn't have, I don't know, first off, licensed his likeness to be in the game, and maybe you should have read your contract.

394
00:26:21,874 --> 00:26:22,935
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

395
00:26:41,150 --> 00:26:51,575
[SPEAKER_08]: I think I kind of said this then, and that is that when they showed this to Courtney Love or when they showed this to No Doubt, they probably didn't show them all this other stuff because of course they're not going to like that.

396
00:26:51,895 --> 00:26:56,137
[SPEAKER_08]: They wanted to show people having a good time, No Doubt singing No Doubt songs.

397
00:26:56,157 --> 00:27:00,439
[SPEAKER_08]: You're not going to win No Doubt over by showing them in the band playing Taylor Swift songs.

398
00:27:00,459 --> 00:27:03,281
[SPEAKER_08]: That's not going to be how you get them to sign on the dotted line.

399
00:27:03,581 --> 00:27:07,983
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's not like the band is going to take the time to sit down for four hours and play this game extensively.

400
00:27:08,263 --> 00:27:08,724
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks for watching!

401
00:27:26,136 --> 00:27:31,359
[SPEAKER_06]: The only thing it's going to do is hurt their chances now to have these people in their games next time.

402
00:27:31,499 --> 00:27:32,220
[SPEAKER_06]: That's true.

403
00:27:32,780 --> 00:27:39,804
[SPEAKER_06]: But the thing is, though, the majority of the artists in the game, they're not the only ones that were in the game, aren't really bitching about it.

404
00:27:39,925 --> 00:27:42,066
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think they really care.

405
00:27:43,121 --> 00:27:44,683
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

406
00:27:59,801 --> 00:28:00,622
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks for watching!

407
00:28:23,297 --> 00:28:24,958
[SPEAKER_08]: So does Courtney Love, believe it or not.

408
00:28:25,278 --> 00:28:28,720
[SPEAKER_08]: She got friends, and bands are going to think twice.

409
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:37,925
[SPEAKER_06]: And maybe they'll think twice, and they'll also realize that, hey, this is what's going to happen if you get involved with Activision.

410
00:28:39,005 --> 00:28:42,447
[SPEAKER_06]: They'll see, based on this, if that's something they don't want, then they won't get involved.

411
00:28:42,887 --> 00:28:47,570
[SPEAKER_06]: Or they'll just, for the next one, they'll just lock it so that these characters can only sing their songs or something like that.

412
00:28:48,835 --> 00:29:06,791
[SPEAKER_08]: regardless of how this all goes down I would really like to see it settled on Judge Judy personally I would like to see Judge Judy settle this whole thing because I'll tell you what if you ever watch that show awesome and I'd like to just see her yell at the people from Activision don't talk when I'm not talking to you

413
00:29:09,389 --> 00:29:12,792
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyhow, chirp, chirp, chirp, chirp.

414
00:29:12,832 --> 00:29:15,535
[SPEAKER_08]: Moving on to completely different news and quickly.

415
00:29:16,195 --> 00:29:18,057
[SPEAKER_08]: Mega Man 10 has been announced.

416
00:29:18,638 --> 00:29:21,000
[SPEAKER_08]: Mega Man 10, I think a lot of us kind of saw this coming.

417
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:22,902
[SPEAKER_08]: Mega Man 9 was obviously very well received.

418
00:29:23,262 --> 00:29:24,643
[SPEAKER_08]: So Mega Man 10 is coming out.

419
00:29:24,964 --> 00:29:26,885
[SPEAKER_08]: Not to be confused with Mega Man X.

420
00:29:27,586 --> 00:29:28,386
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for watching!

421
00:29:43,411 --> 00:29:45,994
[SPEAKER_08]: Because Capcom likes to multi-platform their stuff.

422
00:29:46,294 --> 00:29:49,438
[SPEAKER_08]: But Nintendo Power is getting the first announcement on this.

423
00:29:49,838 --> 00:29:52,281
[SPEAKER_08]: Of course they're not going to tell you it's available on 360 and PS3.

424
00:29:52,541 --> 00:29:54,923
[SPEAKER_06]: Didn't it come out on WiiWare first before with 9?

425
00:29:55,584 --> 00:29:58,127
[SPEAKER_06]: Or was there a slight delay or something like that?

426
00:29:58,307 --> 00:30:01,791
[SPEAKER_08]: It's probably going to be on all the platforms.

427
00:30:01,811 --> 00:30:03,452
[SPEAKER_08]: It's probably like a week delay or something like that.

428
00:30:03,873 --> 00:30:04,774
[SPEAKER_08]: It'll be on all the platforms.

429
00:30:05,134 --> 00:30:05,354
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

430
00:30:06,094 --> 00:30:07,915
[SPEAKER_08]: So Mega Man 10 has been announced.

431
00:30:07,975 --> 00:30:08,395
[SPEAKER_08]: It's coming out.

432
00:30:08,435 --> 00:30:11,176
[SPEAKER_08]: It's retrotastic again, the whole NES style.

433
00:30:11,556 --> 00:30:14,577
[SPEAKER_08]: And one of the new bosses has been announced, Sheep Man.

434
00:30:15,857 --> 00:30:16,917
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, I'm not joking.

435
00:30:17,237 --> 00:30:17,718
[SPEAKER_08]: Sheep Man.

436
00:30:17,738 --> 00:30:21,859
[SPEAKER_08]: There's even some artwork out there that just looks kind of funny.

437
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:31,921
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyhow, also there's supposed to be Proto Man as a playable character again, and there will be a third mystery character.

438
00:30:32,182 --> 00:30:33,602
[SPEAKER_04]: Dude, it better be Forte.

439
00:30:34,758 --> 00:30:36,199
[SPEAKER_08]: Dr. Wily is always the villain at the end of the day.

440
00:30:36,239 --> 00:30:42,324
[SPEAKER_08]: Did you notice in that little screenshot there that they have the dragon shooting guns out of its nipples, which is kind of...

441
00:30:55,274 --> 00:30:56,755
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh my god, that is a little strange.

442
00:30:57,175 --> 00:31:01,216
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, that's just the awkward artwork that Capcom has learned to embrace.

443
00:31:01,296 --> 00:31:03,517
[SPEAKER_08]: Their terrible, terrible box art for Mega Man 1 and 2.

444
00:31:03,617 --> 00:31:05,298
[SPEAKER_06]: There will be dragons with nipple guns.

445
00:31:06,078 --> 00:31:06,598
[SPEAKER_06]: I see it now.

446
00:31:06,638 --> 00:31:07,358
[SPEAKER_08]: Nipple Man!

447
00:31:09,939 --> 00:31:11,400
[SPEAKER_04]: It should be Nipple Woman.

448
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:15,261
[SPEAKER_08]: Sadly, I don't see that happening.

449
00:31:15,301 --> 00:31:17,722
[SPEAKER_08]: I think this is supposed to be a friendly family game going on.

450
00:31:18,082 --> 00:31:21,583
[SPEAKER_04]: But Sheep Man, that's... If we have Sheep Man, we should have Cock Man.

451
00:31:21,703 --> 00:31:23,364
[SPEAKER_08]: What would be Sheep Man's weapon?

452
00:31:23,644 --> 00:31:23,884
[SPEAKER_08]: Like...

453
00:31:25,876 --> 00:31:26,637
[SPEAKER_08]: A woolly gun?

454
00:31:26,877 --> 00:31:30,079
[SPEAKER_08]: A sleep gun.

455
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:33,462
[SPEAKER_04]: Allergies!

456
00:31:33,482 --> 00:31:34,562
[SPEAKER_08]: The allergy blaster.

457
00:31:34,802 --> 00:31:36,584
[SPEAKER_04]: Like he shoots at Mega Man and Mega Man gets a rash.

458
00:31:37,324 --> 00:31:45,250
[SPEAKER_08]: Also supposed to be in the game in easy mode, which for those folks that were struggling a little bit in Mega Man 9, I'm sure in easy mode will be welcomed for the game.

459
00:31:46,271 --> 00:31:47,452
[SPEAKER_08]: Including me, I'm sorry.

460
00:31:47,492 --> 00:31:51,855
[SPEAKER_08]: Mega Man 9, I think I got past like three bosses and that's as far as I could get, so yeah.

461
00:31:52,964 --> 00:31:54,626
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, what do you got for us tonight?

462
00:32:07,358 --> 00:32:11,680
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it's a particular, actually, it's a bit of fine culture, Rob.

463
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:12,761
[SPEAKER_04]: A bit of fine culture.

464
00:32:13,341 --> 00:32:14,781
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a stage production, actually.

465
00:32:15,282 --> 00:32:15,962
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, awesome.

466
00:32:16,202 --> 00:32:16,822
[SPEAKER_04]: So culture.

467
00:32:17,102 --> 00:32:17,323
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

468
00:32:17,363 --> 00:32:18,483
[SPEAKER_04]: Going up and singing.

469
00:32:18,603 --> 00:32:23,806
[SPEAKER_08]: Is it like the fabulous news I found out last night that Sister Act, the movie, is being adapted for Broadway next year?

470
00:32:23,826 --> 00:32:24,886
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought it had already been done.

471
00:32:25,066 --> 00:32:25,786
[SPEAKER_08]: It had been done.

472
00:32:25,846 --> 00:32:26,287
[SPEAKER_03]: It's in London.

473
00:32:26,307 --> 00:32:26,707
[SPEAKER_03]: They did Xanadu.

474
00:32:26,847 --> 00:32:27,727
[SPEAKER_08]: It's in London right now.

475
00:32:28,048 --> 00:32:29,448
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's going to be on Broadway next year.

476
00:32:29,468 --> 00:32:30,269
[SPEAKER_03]: They did Xanadu.

477
00:32:30,949 --> 00:32:31,289
[SPEAKER_08]: I know.

478
00:32:31,509 --> 00:32:32,149
[SPEAKER_08]: Xanadu.

479
00:32:32,169 --> 00:32:33,670
[SPEAKER_08]: It did pretty well, actually.

480
00:32:33,690 --> 00:32:35,391
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it finally closed, but it did very well.

481
00:32:35,919 --> 00:32:41,223
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, this is about another fine stage production, but actually it's being done in Sweden.

482
00:32:42,924 --> 00:32:45,146
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a Silent Hill stage production.

483
00:32:45,166 --> 00:32:46,307
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

484
00:32:46,807 --> 00:33:02,138
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I mean, imagine you step out onto the, you know, the curtain pulls back and you see a man wandering around wearing a car suit, swerving off the road, and then getting out of the car suit to go chase a

485
00:33:03,529 --> 00:33:05,530
[SPEAKER_04]: A 30-year-old dressed as a 5-year-old girl.

486
00:33:05,630 --> 00:33:08,212
[SPEAKER_08]: And the production takes like 50 fog machines.

487
00:33:08,693 --> 00:33:09,834
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, 50 fog machines.

488
00:33:11,175 --> 00:33:14,257
[SPEAKER_04]: But they're going to be posting the whole play on YouTube.

489
00:33:15,538 --> 00:33:15,798
[SPEAKER_08]: Nice.

490
00:33:15,878 --> 00:33:17,980
[SPEAKER_04]: So keep an eye out for that.

491
00:33:19,081 --> 00:33:20,122
[SPEAKER_04]: It's done by a bunch of fans.

492
00:33:20,562 --> 00:33:24,405
[SPEAKER_08]: I would say that this play would get shut down immediately for copyright infringement issues.

493
00:33:24,425 --> 00:33:25,186
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, it's based on Silent Hill 2.

494
00:33:25,802 --> 00:33:49,976
[SPEAKER_08]: but seeing as this is in another country I don't know if that's as easy to do plus I mean I don't know if I were Konami I'd be kind of flattered like I wouldn't want to shut it down I think if I were Konami I'd be like oh shit how are they gonna pull this off one of my friends on LiveJournal they did like a Star Wars play they did a play out of Star Wars the movie and I think they were afraid they were gonna get shut down but it turned out like Lucas embraced it and it was ended up being like officially endorsed by them

495
00:33:50,430 --> 00:33:51,871
[SPEAKER_04]: Josh Whedon is my lord and master now.

496
00:34:18,038 --> 00:34:20,699
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyhow, Silent Hill the play, yes or no?

497
00:34:20,879 --> 00:34:24,820
[SPEAKER_08]: I would love to watch it, except the whole thing's going to be in Swedish, which you know what this means.

498
00:34:25,661 --> 00:34:28,802
[SPEAKER_08]: We need Ake Ripper to go out and observe the play for us.

499
00:34:28,822 --> 00:34:31,603
[SPEAKER_04]: Ake Ripper, you are now our theater reviewer?

500
00:34:32,728 --> 00:34:35,169
[SPEAKER_08]: Congratulations, you've just been promoted to OLR.

501
00:34:35,189 --> 00:34:38,549
[SPEAKER_08]: He's not even listening right now, I'm sure, because we're on at a completely different time.

502
00:34:38,589 --> 00:34:44,230
[SPEAKER_08]: But, you know, if you're listening on Sunday, Aki Ripper, you are now our official Broadway correspondent.

503
00:34:44,871 --> 00:34:46,191
[SPEAKER_08]: This counts for Swedish Broadway.

504
00:34:46,291 --> 00:34:46,511
[SPEAKER_04]: Rob.

505
00:34:46,791 --> 00:34:46,951
[SPEAKER_08]: What?

506
00:34:47,111 --> 00:34:49,432
[SPEAKER_04]: MXT, by the way, going back to the Mega Man story.

507
00:34:49,752 --> 00:34:50,892
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah.

508
00:34:50,952 --> 00:34:54,753
[SPEAKER_04]: So Sheet Man's weapon, according to Wikipedia, is thunder wool.

509
00:34:55,373 --> 00:34:56,193
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, chatters.

510
00:34:56,253 --> 00:34:57,533
[SPEAKER_08]: Chat.orangelandry.com.

511
00:34:57,613 --> 00:34:58,013
[SPEAKER_08]: Thunder wool.

512
00:34:58,033 --> 00:34:58,714
[SPEAKER_08]: Thunder wool.

513
00:34:59,174 --> 00:35:00,374
[SPEAKER_04]: Was it just using static?

514
00:35:00,394 --> 00:35:00,614
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

515
00:35:01,910 --> 00:35:04,893
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you just rub the wool against your body a whole lot and generate the static?

516
00:35:04,933 --> 00:35:05,894
[SPEAKER_04]: Aki Ripper is in chat.

517
00:35:06,374 --> 00:35:06,554
[SPEAKER_08]: Is he?

518
00:35:06,714 --> 00:35:06,854
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh!

519
00:35:06,974 --> 00:35:09,096
[SPEAKER_04]: You are now our theater correspondent.

520
00:35:09,156 --> 00:35:09,977
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, Aki Ripper's here.

521
00:35:10,057 --> 00:35:11,218
[SPEAKER_08]: Congratulations, Aki Ripper.

522
00:35:11,258 --> 00:35:11,938
[SPEAKER_08]: You've been promoted.

523
00:35:11,979 --> 00:35:13,200
[SPEAKER_08]: Now go see the Silent Hill play.

524
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:15,181
[SPEAKER_08]: Thunderwool.

525
00:35:15,481 --> 00:35:17,963
[SPEAKER_08]: It's probably playing on the complete other side of Sweden.

526
00:35:18,023 --> 00:35:20,666
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like hours and hours away from where Aki Ripper's at.

527
00:35:20,686 --> 00:35:22,327
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, how long does it take to get across Sweden?

528
00:35:22,847 --> 00:35:23,328
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

529
00:35:25,149 --> 00:35:26,951
[SPEAKER_08]: By foot or by car or by plane?

530
00:35:27,011 --> 00:35:28,592
[SPEAKER_03]: It depends, I guess, which direction you're going to.

531
00:35:28,692 --> 00:35:29,293
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to be the...

532
00:35:30,197 --> 00:35:33,719
[SPEAKER_06]: The ignorant Americans say, Sweden's not that big, come on.

533
00:35:33,959 --> 00:35:36,741
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, keep in mind... I think it's about the size of California.

534
00:35:36,761 --> 00:35:38,262
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think it's much bigger than California.

535
00:35:38,822 --> 00:35:42,805
[SPEAKER_04]: Keep in mind, our states are technically little small countries.

536
00:35:43,465 --> 00:35:46,607
[SPEAKER_04]: We just happen to be under one big federation.

537
00:35:47,087 --> 00:35:51,250
[SPEAKER_04]: Sort of like, I guess, the European Union without having to... Or like Star Trek.

538
00:35:52,530 --> 00:35:53,071
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, Rob.

539
00:35:53,991 --> 00:35:58,554
[SPEAKER_04]: Someone linked me to a Star Trek menorah, by the way, that someone made out of action figures and LED lights.

540
00:35:59,451 --> 00:35:59,791
[SPEAKER_08]: Beautiful.

541
00:36:00,031 --> 00:36:00,191
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

542
00:36:00,471 --> 00:36:01,512
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

543
00:36:01,612 --> 00:36:04,512
[SPEAKER_08]: Aki Ripper says it's 14 hours away from where he is.

544
00:36:04,632 --> 00:36:05,553
[SPEAKER_08]: That's not that far.

545
00:36:05,573 --> 00:36:06,113
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not that far.

546
00:36:06,133 --> 00:36:06,553
[SPEAKER_04]: Get on a plane.

547
00:36:06,573 --> 00:36:07,373
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll send you gas money.

548
00:36:07,733 --> 00:36:08,233
[SPEAKER_08]: Get on a plane.

549
00:36:08,794 --> 00:36:09,114
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

550
00:36:11,074 --> 00:36:12,375
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki, what do you have for us?

551
00:36:12,955 --> 00:36:13,195
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

552
00:36:13,335 --> 00:36:13,715
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, wait.

553
00:36:13,735 --> 00:36:15,255
[SPEAKER_08]: Before you get there, then fine.

554
00:36:15,315 --> 00:36:25,398
[SPEAKER_08]: If Aki Ripper is going to boo-hoo about 14 hours away, even though he's closer than any of the rest of us, then we need a Swede who's listening to the show who can go, who lives next door to this.

555
00:36:25,458 --> 00:36:27,679
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe that was answering if it was...

556
00:36:28,559 --> 00:36:31,381
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, 14 hours to get from one end of the country to the other.

557
00:36:31,662 --> 00:36:31,782
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh.

558
00:36:33,323 --> 00:36:33,623
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe.

559
00:36:34,144 --> 00:36:34,684
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

560
00:36:34,704 --> 00:36:35,525
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

561
00:36:35,545 --> 00:36:35,905
[SPEAKER_04]: I give up.

562
00:36:35,985 --> 00:36:36,846
[SPEAKER_04]: Or by sheep.

563
00:36:36,866 --> 00:36:38,827
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll just wait for the damn thing to get on YouTube.

564
00:36:38,847 --> 00:36:40,349
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkTetsuya said, no, by sheep.

565
00:36:41,690 --> 00:36:43,691
[SPEAKER_08]: By ThunderWool Airlines.

566
00:36:43,771 --> 00:36:44,652
[SPEAKER_08]: ThunderWool.

567
00:36:44,932 --> 00:36:46,033
[SPEAKER_08]: ThunderWool.

568
00:36:46,574 --> 00:36:48,855
[SPEAKER_08]: That sounds like... This Sunday, Sunday, Sunday.

569
00:36:49,216 --> 00:36:50,697
[SPEAKER_08]: Live at the Monster Truck Rally.

570
00:36:50,817 --> 00:36:54,220
[SPEAKER_08]: See the big trucks take on ThunderWool.

571
00:36:56,081 --> 00:36:56,942
[SPEAKER_08]: Under 18, not admitted.

572
00:36:57,082 --> 00:36:57,983
[SPEAKER_08]: Without parental consent.

573
00:36:59,991 --> 00:37:01,353
[SPEAKER_04]: Candy Cane Jojo's

574
00:37:13,670 --> 00:37:16,151
[SPEAKER_08]: You thought we forgot Orange Lounge Foodio tonight, ladies and gentlemen.

575
00:37:16,971 --> 00:37:22,453
[SPEAKER_06]: So, remember that story that we talked about the PSP minis being playable on the PS3?

576
00:37:22,533 --> 00:37:23,514
[SPEAKER_06]: How was the rumor and everything?

577
00:37:23,754 --> 00:37:29,516
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, this week, update 3.15 came out, allowing you to play PSP minis on your PS3.

578
00:37:30,456 --> 00:37:31,456
[SPEAKER_06]: So hooray!

579
00:37:31,476 --> 00:37:40,139
[SPEAKER_06]: If you were very envious of your PSP minis and you possibly didn't own a PSP, well now you can play them on your PS3.

580
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:49,843
[SPEAKER_06]: And the best part about that is too, that one purchase of the PSP mini obviously will allow you to play it both on the PS3 and on the PSP.

581
00:37:51,343 --> 00:37:59,246
[SPEAKER_06]: And you'll also be able to connect the two systems via LAN to transfer data from one system to the next.

582
00:38:00,131 --> 00:38:02,273
[SPEAKER_06]: Not all the games will work right away.

583
00:38:21,530 --> 00:38:22,350
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

584
00:38:50,043 --> 00:38:51,403
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, here's what I want to know.

585
00:38:52,184 --> 00:39:01,306
[SPEAKER_06]: If you're able to play these PSP minis on your PS3, is that going to lead way to playing PSP games on your PS3?

586
00:39:02,586 --> 00:39:04,266
[SPEAKER_06]: And then we won't need the PSP anymore?

587
00:39:04,346 --> 00:39:06,867
[SPEAKER_06]: You can just buy your game and play the systems?

588
00:39:06,987 --> 00:39:08,307
[SPEAKER_08]: I would like that.

589
00:39:08,447 --> 00:39:10,488
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know if that's something they would do.

590
00:39:13,035 --> 00:39:13,956
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

591
00:39:13,976 --> 00:39:14,036
[SPEAKER_06]: But...

592
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:40,140
[SPEAKER_06]: It'd be a good idea.

593
00:39:40,601 --> 00:39:43,563
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the next step to getting to the PlayStation 2 on the PS3.

594
00:39:44,424 --> 00:39:45,064
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know, chatters.

595
00:39:45,084 --> 00:39:45,564
[SPEAKER_08]: What do you think?

596
00:39:46,085 --> 00:39:53,290
[SPEAKER_08]: Chat.OrangeLinesRadio.com Do you think that having PSP games playable on the PS3 is a good idea for Sony?

597
00:39:53,590 --> 00:39:54,711
[SPEAKER_08]: If it was technically possible.

598
00:39:55,051 --> 00:39:56,573
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's assume that it's technically possible.

599
00:39:57,475 --> 00:39:58,896
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

600
00:39:59,376 --> 00:40:06,139
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you remember the early, early rumors of the PlayStation 3 and some of the trademarks actually showed a UMD drive on the PS3?

601
00:40:06,499 --> 00:40:06,999
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you remember that?

602
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:11,741
[SPEAKER_08]: I remember that vaguely, years and years ago, before this thing came out.

603
00:40:12,302 --> 00:40:15,723
[SPEAKER_08]: Some of the early trademarks, I think we reported on this show, had a UMD drive in it.

604
00:40:16,623 --> 00:40:18,784
[SPEAKER_08]: So maybe this is something they were thinking of at one time.

605
00:40:20,165 --> 00:40:20,425
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe.

606
00:40:21,866 --> 00:40:22,286
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe neat.

607
00:40:23,615 --> 00:40:30,040
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, well, one game that isn't on the PSP, well, it is on the PSP, but the PS3 game is amazing, is LittleBigPlanet.

608
00:40:30,521 --> 00:40:39,228
[SPEAKER_08]: And, you know, this game has kind of gotten coverage a lot in the past few weeks on our show, which is amazing for a game that's been out a year, again, continuing to be supported.

609
00:40:39,748 --> 00:40:48,936
[SPEAKER_08]: And one way that is continuing is through an alliance with Disney for Pirates of the Caribbean content to be added to LittleBigPlanet.

610
00:40:48,956 --> 00:40:51,378
[SPEAKER_08]: That's right, you'll soon get to play Captain Sack.

611
00:40:52,455 --> 00:40:53,516
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

612
00:41:04,162 --> 00:41:07,585
[SPEAKER_08]: Water is going to be the next big thing they add in LittleBigPlanet.

613
00:41:07,805 --> 00:41:11,709
[SPEAKER_08]: Because, you know, the last big mechanic they added was a year ago in the Metal Gear Solid content.

614
00:41:11,729 --> 00:41:15,212
[SPEAKER_08]: They added the gun, the paint gun, and that changed the way you build levels.

615
00:41:15,512 --> 00:41:16,794
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, now they're going to have water.

616
00:41:16,854 --> 00:41:18,335
[SPEAKER_08]: The Sackboys can swim in water.

617
00:41:18,715 --> 00:41:22,058
[SPEAKER_08]: That's going to be huge for developmental levels, and whole new ideas will be there.

618
00:41:23,379 --> 00:41:29,325
[SPEAKER_08]: But, of course, this is a great tie-in to have water-based content, because, obviously, Pirates of the Caribbean, they sail on water.

619
00:41:29,765 --> 00:41:29,885
[SPEAKER_08]: So...

620
00:41:30,786 --> 00:41:32,107
[SPEAKER_08]: This is all supposed to come out, by the way.

621
00:41:32,147 --> 00:41:38,089
[SPEAKER_08]: The rumor is all of this is hitting before Christmas, which would mean probably next week, if this is true.

622
00:41:38,409 --> 00:41:42,431
[SPEAKER_08]: Keep in mind, LittleBigPlanet has not had any major expansion like this.

623
00:41:42,471 --> 00:41:49,014
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, granted, they've kept the game fresh with the levels, the costumes, and some of those things, the stickers and somewhat.

624
00:41:49,214 --> 00:41:54,316
[SPEAKER_08]: But this is the first major game-changing thing they've done since the Metal Gear Solid.

625
00:41:55,726 --> 00:42:03,224
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's awesome I will probably buy it And I haven't played LittleBigPlanet in quite some time So this is something that I guess you could say could get me back I don't know

626
00:42:04,883 --> 00:42:12,868
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, going into our chatroom, chat.orangeloungeradio.com Some of the comments from my earlier question about Do you think PSP games should be on the PS3?

627
00:42:14,109 --> 00:42:25,696
[SPEAKER_08]: Toagak says, only if they give us our fucking UMD drive back Well, technically they never took it away The PSP 3000 is still being made, still being sold, yes And much better than the PSP Go

628
00:42:26,218 --> 00:42:27,779
[SPEAKER_08]: Alpha Cananagram says, sure, why not?

629
00:42:27,839 --> 00:42:31,460
[SPEAKER_08]: PS1 games are allowed on PS3 and they look shitty, so why not PSP games?

630
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:32,421
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, now, hold on.

631
00:42:32,461 --> 00:42:34,862
[SPEAKER_08]: The PS1 games only look shitty because you're spoiled.

632
00:42:35,502 --> 00:42:39,083
[SPEAKER_08]: And those games were made for a different time when we didn't have HD TVs.

633
00:42:39,584 --> 00:42:42,525
[SPEAKER_08]: Even though I'm only talking like 10 years ago, technology was different back then.

634
00:42:42,765 --> 00:42:43,605
[SPEAKER_08]: We're all spoiled now.

635
00:42:43,825 --> 00:42:45,306
[SPEAKER_08]: They look shitty because we have better TVs.

636
00:42:46,018 --> 00:42:47,498
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

637
00:43:05,183 --> 00:43:07,587
[SPEAKER_08]: may be coming soon due to a leak in update trophies

638
00:43:17,984 --> 00:43:26,132
[SPEAKER_08]: And one other thing from chat, TigerClaw says, who knows, perhaps Sony is secretly working on a PSP 4000, which would probably be a hybrid of the Go or something.

639
00:43:26,873 --> 00:43:28,214
[SPEAKER_08]: You never know what Sony might be doing.

640
00:43:28,715 --> 00:43:30,597
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know so much about another PSP revision.

641
00:43:31,017 --> 00:43:33,359
[SPEAKER_08]: I think, honestly, the next thing we're going to get is like a PSP 2.

642
00:43:34,460 --> 00:43:36,422
[SPEAKER_08]: But I've been wrong before.

643
00:43:36,603 --> 00:43:36,963
[SPEAKER_08]: Who knows?

644
00:43:37,984 --> 00:43:39,505
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyhow, DarkSakura, what's up next for us?

645
00:43:40,266 --> 00:43:40,647
[SPEAKER_08]: Stuff.

646
00:43:41,407 --> 00:43:41,948
[SPEAKER_08]: And such.

647
00:43:42,495 --> 00:43:48,360
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, there's actually been an announcement by SNK for some Xbox Live Arcade games.

648
00:43:48,821 --> 00:43:56,068
[SPEAKER_04]: We actually have Metal Slug 7 isn't coming out.

649
00:43:56,908 --> 00:44:07,338
[SPEAKER_04]: But Metal Slug XX or maybe XX is the PSP remixed version of the DS one is going to be coming out in 2010 instead.

650
00:44:08,739 --> 00:44:17,444
[SPEAKER_04]: and as far as Xbox Live Arcade fighting games, there's going to be King of Fighters 2002 Ultimate Match and Neo Geo Battle Coliseum.

651
00:44:17,784 --> 00:44:20,725
[SPEAKER_04]: There also will be the King of Fighters Sky Stage.

652
00:44:21,025 --> 00:44:21,966
[SPEAKER_06]: That looks stupid.

653
00:44:22,486 --> 00:44:25,247
[SPEAKER_04]: It looks incredibly stupid, but I think I want to play it just for lols.

654
00:44:27,889 --> 00:44:29,189
[SPEAKER_04]: So hey, more Metal Slug for me.

655
00:44:31,010 --> 00:44:32,251
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's never quite a bad thing?

656
00:44:32,331 --> 00:44:37,434
[SPEAKER_04]: Or more Flying Iori shooting things in the sky with his big Orochi self.

657
00:44:37,674 --> 00:44:38,014
[SPEAKER_06]: And how.

658
00:44:38,854 --> 00:44:40,636
[SPEAKER_06]: Twin Sector on PC

659
00:44:56,969 --> 00:45:00,391
[SPEAKER_06]: I remember Reader Rabbit on the Apple IIe.

660
00:45:00,431 --> 00:45:00,711
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

661
00:45:00,731 --> 00:45:00,811
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow.

662
00:45:12,397 --> 00:45:12,678
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

663
00:45:39,983 --> 00:46:07,523
[SPEAKER_06]: and then also more stuff for little kids Playmobil Pirates and Playmobil Circus Pirates for the DS and Circus for the Wii and that's it that still sounds like a lot considering where we're at that's sad there's actually some better stuff well next week's even lighter but it's really like two games but they're decent games well I wish excuse me I wish I could say it's a slow week in Japan but it's really not it's actually still a pretty big week over there

664
00:46:08,496 --> 00:46:08,816
[SPEAKER_08]: Gundam Musou 2

665
00:46:25,436 --> 00:46:26,217
[SPEAKER_08]: I believe so.

666
00:46:26,297 --> 00:46:27,877
[SPEAKER_08]: It looks very much like it.

667
00:46:27,937 --> 00:46:29,798
[SPEAKER_08]: The whole combo meter in the corner and everything.

668
00:46:29,818 --> 00:46:30,899
[SPEAKER_08]: Probably the re-release of it.

669
00:46:31,239 --> 00:46:33,140
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, and the graphics are very, very pretty.

670
00:46:34,061 --> 00:46:38,223
[SPEAKER_08]: But, of course, this week is epic week in Japan and actually for a lot of people here in the U.S.

671
00:46:38,283 --> 00:46:38,463
[SPEAKER_08]: too.

672
00:46:38,803 --> 00:46:40,144
[SPEAKER_08]: I know a lot of people are going to be importing.

673
00:46:40,304 --> 00:46:40,564
[SPEAKER_00]: Not me.

674
00:46:40,604 --> 00:46:43,325
[SPEAKER_08]: Final Fantasy XIII does come out on the PlayStation 3.

675
00:46:43,926 --> 00:46:53,411
[SPEAKER_08]: Seeing as the PlayStation 3 is region free, if you want to pay $100, yes, that's right, that's what some importers are charging for this, $100, you can import this game.

676
00:46:53,988 --> 00:46:55,708
[SPEAKER_06]: Death Connection Not the Love Connection

677
00:47:29,759 --> 00:47:33,682
[SPEAKER_08]: Amelia was entrusted to the priest when she was a baby.

678
00:47:34,002 --> 00:47:36,924
[SPEAKER_08]: Growing up in the small town church, the girl became a gentle beauty.

679
00:47:37,284 --> 00:47:41,327
[SPEAKER_08]: Along with the priest and Joshua, a boy she sees as a brother, she lived a peaceful life.

680
00:47:41,707 --> 00:47:46,731
[SPEAKER_08]: However, everything changed the night mafia members charged into the church seeking to end Amelia's life.

681
00:47:49,221 --> 00:47:50,181
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's got everything.

682
00:47:50,241 --> 00:47:54,402
[SPEAKER_08]: It's got the mafia, church, religion things.

683
00:47:54,862 --> 00:47:57,343
[SPEAKER_08]: It's all in the Death Connection coming out on the PlayStation 2.

684
00:47:58,863 --> 00:48:07,285
[SPEAKER_08]: And on the Nintendo DS, Dear Girl Stories, Hibiki, Tokokun Daisakusen comes out in regular and limited edition.

685
00:48:07,705 --> 00:48:10,726
[SPEAKER_08]: Deka Sports DS also making its way to the Nintendo DS.

686
00:48:10,906 --> 00:48:15,587
[SPEAKER_08]: And Loki, I know, has already probably pre-ordered Jewel Pet 2 comes out on the DS.

687
00:48:16,207 --> 00:48:18,828
[SPEAKER_08]: As well as a game I first read as PP Girl.

688
00:48:19,008 --> 00:48:19,248
[SPEAKER_08]: P-O-U-P-E-E

689
00:48:44,475 --> 00:48:48,117
[SPEAKER_08]: and a total of 8 people can play Poopy Girl all at once.

690
00:48:48,197 --> 00:48:49,919
[SPEAKER_04]: Isn't it like Poupée or something?

691
00:48:50,299 --> 00:48:51,179
[SPEAKER_04]: Like French or something?

692
00:48:51,339 --> 00:48:52,380
[SPEAKER_08]: The chatroom is yelling at me.

693
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:54,702
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like Po-Pay, just the way it's pronounced.

694
00:48:55,062 --> 00:49:00,365
[SPEAKER_08]: But I'm sorry, when I read it in my honky American way, P-O-U-P-E-E, Poopy Girl.

695
00:49:05,508 --> 00:49:09,131
[SPEAKER_08]: To which all the Japanese purists are screaming at me in chatroom.

696
00:49:11,556 --> 00:49:14,138
[SPEAKER_08]: on the PSP Dice Dice Fantasia.

697
00:49:15,138 --> 00:49:16,139
[SPEAKER_04]: Dice Dice Baby.

698
00:49:16,359 --> 00:49:17,199
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you even care?

699
00:49:17,660 --> 00:49:20,281
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you even care when Poopy Girl's out this week?

700
00:49:21,542 --> 00:49:22,402
[SPEAKER_04]: That, no.

701
00:49:24,644 --> 00:49:26,285
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyhow, moving on.

702
00:49:26,325 --> 00:49:28,266
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, what's coming out in the UK?

703
00:49:28,726 --> 00:49:29,727
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, not a busy week.

704
00:49:31,636 --> 00:49:36,779
[SPEAKER_04]: We have, for our buddies overseas, we have on the 15th, EverQuest Underfoot.

705
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,262
[SPEAKER_04]: Does anyone still play EverQuest?

706
00:49:40,322 --> 00:49:42,783
[SPEAKER_08]: A lot of people, they wouldn't be doing these expansions.

707
00:49:42,964 --> 00:49:43,424
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess.

708
00:49:44,364 --> 00:49:47,046
[SPEAKER_04]: On the 16th, we have Alien Breed Evolution.

709
00:49:47,867 --> 00:49:51,689
[SPEAKER_04]: 17th, we have Blue Toad Murder Files, whatever the fuck that is.

710
00:49:55,091 --> 00:49:57,653
[SPEAKER_04]: On the 18th, we have Buzz Quiz World.

711
00:49:58,414 --> 00:50:00,335
[SPEAKER_04]: And 19th, we have Nicky Rock and Ball.

712
00:50:02,244 --> 00:50:02,524
[SPEAKER_04]: That's it.

713
00:50:03,585 --> 00:50:06,466
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm laughing over here from this comment in chat about Poopie Girl.

714
00:50:06,866 --> 00:50:07,867
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry, Po-Pay Girl.

715
00:50:08,227 --> 00:50:13,290
[SPEAKER_08]: Salacious Pop says, She spends the entire game walking funny and looking upset.

716
00:50:14,270 --> 00:50:15,271
[SPEAKER_04]: That is excellent.

717
00:50:19,813 --> 00:50:23,155
[SPEAKER_08]: Alpha Cananigram says, Sky, y'all are trying to kill me by making me laugh to death.

718
00:50:23,215 --> 00:50:24,596
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, we try to be funny once in a while.

719
00:50:25,556 --> 00:50:25,856
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

720
00:50:25,916 --> 00:50:28,498
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyhow, moving on to some more news.

721
00:50:28,838 --> 00:50:30,659
[SPEAKER_08]: Our classic game of the week just a few minutes away.

722
00:50:32,779 --> 00:50:32,999
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

723
00:50:34,921 --> 00:50:48,371
[SPEAKER_06]: So, apparently, I didn't even realize there was a whole lawsuit against Divino, but there was, apparently, by Nintendo, trying to prevent the company from selling DS flashcards.

724
00:50:49,312 --> 00:50:59,700
[SPEAKER_06]: Apparently, they won, I believe, their injunction in Hong Kong, but in France, and why they're trying to...

725
00:51:01,221 --> 00:51:02,102
[SPEAKER_06]: Winning in France as well.

726
00:51:02,822 --> 00:51:05,083
[SPEAKER_06]: Apparently, they lost.

727
00:51:05,943 --> 00:51:09,045
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, Divino won that suit.

728
00:51:09,585 --> 00:51:13,547
[SPEAKER_06]: And now, of course, Nintendo is appealing the ruling.

729
00:51:14,228 --> 00:51:20,331
[SPEAKER_06]: And finally, I guess another lawsuit against them to try to prevent them from selling DS flashcards.

730
00:51:20,371 --> 00:51:28,875
[SPEAKER_06]: Because it enables people to... Apparently, they call it a game copying device.

731
00:51:30,424 --> 00:51:32,323
[SPEAKER_06]: Honestly though, that's a little...

732
00:51:34,457 --> 00:51:34,857
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

733
00:51:35,398 --> 00:51:39,480
[SPEAKER_06]: The device doesn't allow you to copy games, but it allows you to play copied games, I guess.

734
00:51:39,681 --> 00:51:40,021
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, wait.

735
00:51:40,041 --> 00:51:46,305
[SPEAKER_08]: Somebody's got to break this down for me, because I seem to remember talking about this when the whole appeal was won in Hong Kong.

736
00:51:46,645 --> 00:51:47,966
[SPEAKER_08]: So now they're going to France.

737
00:51:48,246 --> 00:51:50,087
[SPEAKER_08]: Is there a production of this going on there, too?

738
00:51:50,107 --> 00:51:51,128
[SPEAKER_06]: They didn't win in Hong Kong.

739
00:51:51,148 --> 00:51:52,529
[SPEAKER_06]: They actually lost in Hong Kong.

740
00:51:52,909 --> 00:51:57,372
[SPEAKER_06]: It shows you how much I was paying attention that night.

741
00:51:57,532 --> 00:52:04,177
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, Nintendo made a statement that Divino still owes the company damages from a ruling made in Nintendo's favor in Hong Kong last year.

742
00:52:05,078 --> 00:52:05,659
[SPEAKER_06]: And it says... So...

743
00:52:19,870 --> 00:52:20,631
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't you own this device?

744
00:52:42,117 --> 00:52:42,737
[SPEAKER_06]: The R4?

745
00:52:42,757 --> 00:52:44,357
[SPEAKER_06]: I own two in my life.

746
00:52:44,377 --> 00:52:46,638
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a Ninja Pass, too.

747
00:52:46,658 --> 00:52:47,418
[SPEAKER_06]: I have an R4.

748
00:52:48,058 --> 00:52:50,259
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, have you ever used the R4 to pirate a game?

749
00:52:50,699 --> 00:52:51,399
[SPEAKER_06]: To pirate a game?

750
00:52:51,579 --> 00:52:51,739
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

751
00:52:51,819 --> 00:52:53,439
[SPEAKER_06]: I've used it to play pirated games, yes.

752
00:52:55,720 --> 00:52:56,360
[SPEAKER_08]: Tricky, tricky.

753
00:52:56,420 --> 00:52:57,240
[SPEAKER_08]: I see what you did there.

754
00:52:57,320 --> 00:52:57,600
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

755
00:52:59,760 --> 00:52:59,980
[SPEAKER_08]: Fine.

756
00:53:00,360 --> 00:53:05,301
[SPEAKER_06]: And I can't order from Divino because my bank doesn't like me ordering from countries across the sea.

757
00:53:05,761 --> 00:53:07,762
[SPEAKER_06]: Malaysia, I think, is where they're out of.

758
00:53:08,762 --> 00:53:08,922
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

759
00:53:10,137 --> 00:53:11,979
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, well, I don't know.

760
00:53:11,999 --> 00:53:18,187
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I think if it's being used for bad things, Nintendo has a right to some extent, but at the same time...

761
00:53:19,619 --> 00:53:26,121
[SPEAKER_08]: There are legitimate purposes for these, I suppose, and you can't go after the people that are doing this for legitimate reasons.

762
00:53:26,141 --> 00:53:31,163
[SPEAKER_08]: You have to go after the people that are dumping the games and putting them on the web.

763
00:53:31,183 --> 00:53:33,364
[SPEAKER_06]: That's who they need to go after is the people dumping the games.

764
00:53:33,444 --> 00:53:46,669
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just like with BitTorrent and stuff like that, a lot of times they're going after the release groups that are dumping the titles because the downloading of the titles isn't really...

765
00:53:48,255 --> 00:53:50,298
[SPEAKER_06]: They're not really stealing anything.

766
00:53:50,318 --> 00:53:50,698
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

767
00:53:50,799 --> 00:53:54,363
[SPEAKER_06]: It's kind of tough with digital media and stuff because you're not technically stealing something.

768
00:53:54,403 --> 00:53:55,665
[SPEAKER_06]: You're just making a copy of it.

769
00:53:57,501 --> 00:54:03,823
[SPEAKER_06]: And they're kind of going after more like real piracy, like people actually making bootlegs and selling them on the street type stuff.

770
00:54:05,043 --> 00:54:07,944
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, moving on to one more story before we get to the classic game of the week tonight.

771
00:54:08,564 --> 00:54:12,185
[SPEAKER_08]: We were actually linked to this story on our Twitter and it was suggested that we talk about this.

772
00:54:12,425 --> 00:54:18,786
[SPEAKER_08]: And Kotaku ran a feature this week about who they're calling – well, it says – I guess the name of the story is Achievement Chore.

773
00:54:19,146 --> 00:54:21,347
[SPEAKER_08]: She plays for Gamerscore whether it's fun or not.

774
00:54:21,587 --> 00:54:22,948
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkDeft, Drew, Carameldansen

775
00:54:41,764 --> 00:54:42,424
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

776
00:55:01,431 --> 00:55:02,853
[SPEAKER_08]: Toshiba, anyway, nobody cares.

777
00:55:03,193 --> 00:55:05,516
[SPEAKER_08]: But anyhow, they ran this little story on her.

778
00:55:05,596 --> 00:55:08,459
[SPEAKER_08]: She's a 24-year-old stay-at-home mom in northwest Indiana.

779
00:55:08,759 --> 00:55:13,925
[SPEAKER_08]: She got started on this whole thing when I guess it became like a friendly race between her and her friend about gamerscore.

780
00:55:14,425 --> 00:55:17,388
[SPEAKER_08]: And it was a race to see who could get 20,000 first.

781
00:55:17,428 --> 00:55:18,970
[SPEAKER_08]: And now I guess it's just become an obsession.

782
00:55:19,331 --> 00:55:20,392
[SPEAKER_08]: The girl has, I guess...

783
00:55:22,133 --> 00:55:39,105
[SPEAKER_08]: a Japanese Xbox 360 and a regular Xbox 360 she has mad respect in the community for I guess being nice she says quote once I found sites that had guides on which were the easy games I beat 20,000 in like a month and a half it got me hooked and it was like a drug a bad drug a bad habit

784
00:55:39,665 --> 00:55:40,686
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's kind of interesting.

785
00:55:40,726 --> 00:55:43,307
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, we joke a lot about achievement whores here on the show.

786
00:55:43,347 --> 00:55:45,409
[SPEAKER_08]: And I know we've called Loki an achievement whore many times.

787
00:55:45,789 --> 00:55:47,410
[SPEAKER_08]: But it's kind of like... I just don't care anymore.

788
00:55:47,450 --> 00:55:48,651
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, now you stop caring.

789
00:55:48,671 --> 00:55:50,152
[SPEAKER_08]: And I did too to some extent.

790
00:55:50,192 --> 00:55:52,953
[SPEAKER_08]: But it's kind of interesting to see what makes them tick.

791
00:55:53,654 --> 00:55:54,574
[SPEAKER_08]: And I thought this story was...

792
00:55:55,885 --> 00:55:58,226
[SPEAKER_08]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

793
00:56:23,979 --> 00:56:26,560
[SPEAKER_08]: And she does have a six-year-old girl that she's raising, too.

794
00:56:27,040 --> 00:56:28,460
[SPEAKER_08]: So, there you go.

795
00:56:28,540 --> 00:56:30,281
[SPEAKER_04]: Rob, I'm playing with poopies.

796
00:56:31,321 --> 00:56:32,401
[SPEAKER_08]: Did you go onto the website?

797
00:56:32,481 --> 00:56:33,201
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, I did.

798
00:56:33,701 --> 00:56:36,322
[SPEAKER_08]: Was Tiger Claw linked us to the... I love these things.

799
00:56:36,342 --> 00:56:37,442
[SPEAKER_08]: ...Pope Girl website?

800
00:56:37,902 --> 00:56:39,343
[SPEAKER_08]: Or is it renamed Poopy Girl?

801
00:56:39,743 --> 00:56:43,604
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been playing... Well, keep in mind, I used to play with the candy bar doll maker thing.

802
00:56:43,964 --> 00:56:45,384
[SPEAKER_04]: So, this is actually... And I've got my big dolls.

803
00:56:45,524 --> 00:56:46,624
[SPEAKER_04]: So, this is actually kind of fun for me.

804
00:56:47,164 --> 00:56:50,845
[SPEAKER_04]: Even though, like, you know... So, you like Poopy Girls?

805
00:56:53,326 --> 00:56:53,466
[SPEAKER_06]: Um...

806
00:56:53,954 --> 00:56:54,735
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for watching!

807
00:57:08,300 --> 00:57:08,700
[SPEAKER_08]: Why is that?

808
00:57:08,940 --> 00:57:13,003
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the top ten reasons, you know, to play Sims, according to them.

809
00:57:13,283 --> 00:57:16,605
[SPEAKER_06]: They're all, your friends can throw a rockin' party, and then burn the house down.

810
00:57:16,745 --> 00:57:25,270
[SPEAKER_06]: And so they show that, and then there's like another one, it's like, you know, these two women, oh, because learning a new language is sexy, is number nine.

811
00:57:25,290 --> 00:57:27,712
[SPEAKER_06]: They have like the teacher wearing just lingerie and stuff.

812
00:57:28,292 --> 00:57:31,794
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's like all the really wrong things people do with the Sims.

813
00:57:31,814 --> 00:57:36,117
[SPEAKER_06]: Your sister can flirt with death, which is awesome, instead of your boyfriend.

814
00:57:37,117 --> 00:57:59,698
[SPEAKER_06]: or her boyfriend I guess um and then they also had like uh your kids can finally learn to get along and they show the girl like laughing maniacally and her brother's on fire and it's awesome your grandma can still spy on the neighbors and not get arrested and they have like her peeping on like some naked guy which is kind of funny um

815
00:58:01,055 --> 00:58:03,537
[SPEAKER_06]: Your brother and sister, oh, your brother can finally get lucky.

816
00:58:03,797 --> 00:58:06,598
[SPEAKER_06]: And they have, like, some chick staring him down.

817
00:58:09,320 --> 00:58:10,201
[SPEAKER_06]: Killing your boss.

818
00:58:10,321 --> 00:58:12,582
[SPEAKER_06]: And then they have, like, what are some of the other ones?

819
00:58:14,043 --> 00:58:14,943
[SPEAKER_06]: Experimenting.

820
00:58:14,963 --> 00:58:15,904
[SPEAKER_06]: They have, like, two chicks.

821
00:58:16,064 --> 00:58:17,105
[SPEAKER_06]: One dressed up like a cheerleader.

822
00:58:17,165 --> 00:58:21,347
[SPEAKER_06]: One dressed up like, oh, God, I don't remember what else the other one was.

823
00:58:22,488 --> 00:58:23,108
[SPEAKER_06]: Making out.

824
00:58:23,469 --> 00:58:27,231
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just all sex, violence, all the stuff he got.

825
00:58:27,251 --> 00:58:28,712
[SPEAKER_08]: All the great things about The Sims.

826
00:58:29,799 --> 00:58:30,259
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura.com

827
00:58:59,167 --> 00:59:01,673
[SPEAKER_08]: and pick a game from yesteryear that she says, you know what?

828
00:59:02,455 --> 00:59:04,860
[SPEAKER_08]: You bitches should be checking this game out.

829
00:59:06,825 --> 00:59:07,245
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

830
00:59:07,266 --> 00:59:07,346
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

831
00:59:08,283 --> 00:59:12,145
[SPEAKER_08]: and I closed the link to whatever she sent me earlier for the game, but that's alright.

832
00:59:12,165 --> 00:59:14,105
[SPEAKER_08]: If you don't have it again, that's okay, I'll find it.

833
00:59:14,125 --> 00:59:15,746
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I can get it.

834
00:59:17,847 --> 00:59:19,728
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, the game is Einhander.

835
00:59:19,888 --> 00:59:20,928
[SPEAKER_08]: Yay, Einhander!

836
00:59:21,408 --> 00:59:23,689
[SPEAKER_04]: Which is a pretty cool shooting game.

837
00:59:24,870 --> 00:59:26,890
[SPEAKER_04]: It's pretty rare.

838
00:59:27,371 --> 00:59:30,752
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, not as in it was made by Rare, but it's pretty rare of a game.

839
00:59:31,712 --> 00:59:35,193
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, it's a side-scrolling shooter.

840
00:59:35,473 --> 00:59:40,514
[SPEAKER_04]: It was done by Square, and it came out on PlayStation in 1997.

841
00:59:40,594 --> 00:59:44,635
[SPEAKER_04]: It did get a re-release for PSN on June 25th.

842
00:59:45,775 --> 00:59:53,636
[SPEAKER_04]: It means single-handed, because the ship that you use has a single manipulator arm.

843
00:59:54,717 --> 00:59:55,837
[SPEAKER_04]: That was the one that I thought sucked.

844
00:59:56,764 --> 00:59:57,845
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry, it's just the first one I found.

845
00:59:57,865 --> 00:59:59,446
[SPEAKER_04]: There's one on there for like stage 7 or stage 5.

846
00:59:59,627 --> 01:00:00,247
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, I'll find it.

847
01:00:00,387 --> 01:00:02,529
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll try and help Rob find the right thing.

848
01:00:02,929 --> 01:00:06,493
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, it's about a war between the Earth and the Moon.

849
01:00:06,593 --> 01:00:11,777
[SPEAKER_04]: It has a really cool soundtrack done by Fukui Kenichiro.

850
01:00:12,077 --> 01:00:21,105
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, you play through the game, and it's sort of a 2.5D, so it's got shifting camera angles, and everything in the game is 3D, but you mostly play...

851
01:00:22,927 --> 01:00:24,188
[SPEAKER_04]: in a two-dimensional method.

852
01:00:24,488 --> 01:00:25,389
[SPEAKER_04]: You've got different multiples.

853
01:00:26,690 --> 01:00:29,252
[SPEAKER_04]: You've got different difficulty settings, multiples of those.

854
01:00:30,553 --> 01:00:34,956
[SPEAKER_04]: You do have a free mode that gives you unlimited continues, but you cannot have a score.

855
01:00:36,578 --> 01:00:40,340
[SPEAKER_04]: You can get different speeds, and you have...

856
01:00:41,550 --> 01:00:51,874
[SPEAKER_04]: You start off with a machine gun and you can collect gun pods that will give you different enemy missions or cannons or guided missile launchers or even a lightsaber type of thing.

857
01:00:54,435 --> 01:00:59,117
[SPEAKER_04]: There's also... You have to throw away your gun pods when you run out of ammo.

858
01:00:59,697 --> 01:01:01,198
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's that.

859
01:01:03,217 --> 01:01:23,523
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, you have a multiplier bar and a hit gauge counter, so as you destroy the cores of the enemies, your hit counter increases, and you get multiplied points by that, but when you stop shooting things, your counter decreases.

860
01:01:23,963 --> 01:01:25,944
[SPEAKER_04]: So basically, this is helping you for your score.

861
01:01:28,075 --> 01:01:29,435
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a pretty neat game.

862
01:01:30,056 --> 01:01:32,317
[SPEAKER_04]: It's actually the first 3D shooter that Square did.

863
01:01:37,680 --> 01:01:45,564
[SPEAKER_04]: They actually said that Square used some of what they learned from making Final Fantasy VII into Einhander.

864
01:01:48,482 --> 01:01:59,027
[SPEAKER_04]: And, uh... It actually... One cool thing about it is that, um... There was another game that came out in Japan that was, um... Chocobo no Fushigi na Dungeon, which is, you know, Chocobo's Mystery Dungeon.

865
01:01:59,827 --> 01:02:06,110
[SPEAKER_04]: And it had a bonus Mystery Data Disk, which actually was memory card data for a lot of games, including Einhander.

866
01:02:06,870 --> 01:02:09,471
[SPEAKER_04]: Um... Working Designs wanted to bring it out.

867
01:02:10,732 --> 01:02:15,434
[SPEAKER_04]: Um... But, um... Square just actually did it anyway.

868
01:02:15,714 --> 01:02:15,854
[SPEAKER_04]: So...

869
01:02:16,434 --> 01:02:18,737
[SPEAKER_04]: Really cool game, really cool, really fun game.

870
01:02:18,797 --> 01:02:23,082
[SPEAKER_08]: And you have to understand, really fucking hot for this era on the PlayStation 1.

871
01:02:23,542 --> 01:02:25,064
[SPEAKER_08]: The graphics were just outstanding.

872
01:02:25,505 --> 01:02:28,308
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah, and it's a pretty difficult game too.

873
01:02:29,449 --> 01:02:35,776
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I'd have to say that the play in it is really tight.

874
01:02:37,074 --> 01:02:41,476
[SPEAKER_04]: And also, the music that goes with the stages, I always thought was spot on.

875
01:02:45,397 --> 01:02:50,579
[SPEAKER_04]: The only thing that actually has a problem with it, I think, is that you can't play two-player.

876
01:02:51,680 --> 01:02:53,040
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, that's a bummer.

877
01:02:53,360 --> 01:02:55,281
[SPEAKER_04]: So you can't be, I guess, Zweihander.

878
01:02:56,501 --> 01:02:58,562
[SPEAKER_04]: If they did a sequel, I think they should do Zweihander.

879
01:02:59,703 --> 01:03:01,243
[SPEAKER_04]: And, like, have two different gun arms.

880
01:03:02,584 --> 01:03:03,124
[SPEAKER_04]: It's possible.

881
01:03:04,665 --> 01:03:05,025
[SPEAKER_04]: That's it.

882
01:03:05,265 --> 01:03:05,605
[SPEAKER_04]: Einhander.

883
01:03:06,522 --> 01:03:13,927
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, there you go kids, your classic game of the week this week is Einhander, available on the PlayStation numero uno.

884
01:03:14,627 --> 01:03:24,773
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, that's going to do it for part A tonight, we're going to take a quick break though, we'll be right back with more of Orange Lounge Radio, our little special Saturday edition that we'll also play again on Sunday, and also play again on the podcast.

885
01:03:25,174 --> 01:03:26,955
[SPEAKER_08]: So stay tuned, we'll be right back with plenty more.

886
01:03:33,322 --> 01:03:39,525
[SPEAKER_08]: Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio on this Saturday afternoon, December the 12th of 2009.

887
01:03:39,565 --> 01:03:39,945
[SPEAKER_08]: That's right.

888
01:03:40,285 --> 01:03:43,667
[SPEAKER_08]: We are taping a little bit early for tomorrow night's show.

889
01:03:43,707 --> 01:03:46,649
[SPEAKER_08]: So you'll hear this again on Sunday, December 13th, of course, at our usual time.

890
01:03:47,049 --> 01:03:51,331
[SPEAKER_08]: And then, of course, on our podcast feed available at www.orangeloungeradio.com.

891
01:03:51,651 --> 01:03:56,534
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, during the break there, I had to get my new toy all out of the box and unpacked.

892
01:03:56,814 --> 01:03:57,294
[SPEAKER_08]: Check this out.

893
01:04:04,605 --> 01:04:05,906
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

894
01:04:34,758 --> 01:04:42,662
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, there is a game that's out there on Microsoft's community game service that will help you talk to girls.

895
01:04:43,723 --> 01:04:44,183
[SPEAKER_06]: That's right.

896
01:04:44,403 --> 01:04:45,464
[SPEAKER_08]: In case you don't know how.

897
01:04:45,824 --> 01:05:02,613
[SPEAKER_06]: It's an indie game called Don't Be Nervous Talking to Girls, and it allows you to, I guess, practice by talking to a picture of a woman with some interactive dialogue that allows you to choose from a few different...

898
01:05:04,864 --> 01:05:05,565
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for watching!

899
01:05:24,920 --> 01:05:28,802
[SPEAKER_08]: I would like to see DarkSakura play this game on how to talk to girls and see how it goes.

900
01:05:28,962 --> 01:05:29,843
[SPEAKER_04]: I am a girl!

901
01:05:30,643 --> 01:05:32,924
[SPEAKER_04]: And I like being told I am from outer space.

902
01:05:33,505 --> 01:05:34,365
[SPEAKER_06]: It's only a dollar.

903
01:05:34,545 --> 01:05:36,286
[SPEAKER_06]: A whole dollar?

904
01:05:36,306 --> 01:05:37,147
[SPEAKER_06]: A whole dollar.

905
01:05:37,847 --> 01:05:40,609
[SPEAKER_06]: I may pick this up just for shits and giggles.

906
01:05:40,729 --> 01:05:44,771
[SPEAKER_08]: Leo Shen in our chatroom, chat.orangelandre.com says, will they have a choice to put it in?

907
01:05:47,852 --> 01:05:48,453
Stick it in!

908
01:05:50,056 --> 01:05:50,456
[SPEAKER_06]: Ah, yes.

909
01:05:51,397 --> 01:05:52,077
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe in the sequel.

910
01:05:52,317 --> 01:05:53,157
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe in the sequel.

911
01:05:54,678 --> 01:05:58,680
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, Yakuza 3 is making its way over to the U.S.

912
01:05:58,940 --> 01:05:59,360
[SPEAKER_06]: as well.

913
01:05:59,620 --> 01:06:09,744
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to be heading over here March 2010, and will feature the wonderful gameplay that the Japanese have already been able to check out for a while now.

914
01:06:10,444 --> 01:06:14,326
[SPEAKER_06]: It's also actually coming to Europe and Australia around that same time frame as well, so that's kind of cool.

915
01:06:15,964 --> 01:06:21,389
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, 505 Games announced a brand new series that they're going to be putting out called Naughty Bear.

916
01:06:22,191 --> 01:06:26,935
[SPEAKER_06]: And I have to admit, their bear rendering ability is quite amazing.

917
01:06:27,075 --> 01:06:28,597
[SPEAKER_08]: You've been a very naughty bear.

918
01:06:29,357 --> 01:06:32,620
[SPEAKER_08]: Of course, in gay culture, naughty bear means a whole other thing.

919
01:06:33,601 --> 01:06:35,583
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, yeah.

920
01:06:35,783 --> 01:06:40,307
[SPEAKER_06]: Apparently, the game is actually a violent action game starring an animated stuffed bear.

921
01:06:40,948 --> 01:06:46,552
[SPEAKER_06]: Specifically, a stuffed bear who swears revenge on other jerk bears for failing to invite him to a party.

922
01:06:47,333 --> 01:06:56,837
[SPEAKER_06]: and so your goal is to scare and irritate and of course hurt other bears racking up naughty points as you do using weapons during about the game's 30 stages.

923
01:06:56,877 --> 01:06:59,818
[SPEAKER_08]: Wait, so you play a bear encouraged to rape other bears?

924
01:07:00,338 --> 01:07:01,519
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, they never said rape.

925
01:07:01,639 --> 01:07:02,639
[SPEAKER_06]: They said hurt.

926
01:07:02,879 --> 01:07:03,640
[SPEAKER_06]: In the face.

927
01:07:05,740 --> 01:07:06,341
[SPEAKER_06]: That's kind of cool.

928
01:07:07,661 --> 01:07:09,262
[SPEAKER_06]: They're calling it Manhunt for Teddy Bears.

929
01:07:10,942 --> 01:07:11,982
[SPEAKER_08]: That's really what it is.

930
01:07:12,002 --> 01:07:12,863
[SPEAKER_08]: This is about violence.

931
01:07:12,983 --> 01:07:13,903
[SPEAKER_08]: This is just teddy bears.

932
01:07:13,923 --> 01:07:14,383
[SPEAKER_08]: It's okay.

933
01:07:15,564 --> 01:07:17,764
[SPEAKER_08]: You can tear Teddy Ruxpin limb from limb.

934
01:07:17,804 --> 01:07:18,264
[SPEAKER_08]: It doesn't matter.

935
01:07:18,304 --> 01:07:18,844
[SPEAKER_08]: He's just a bear.

936
01:07:18,884 --> 01:07:20,405
[SPEAKER_06]: It's coming from the developer, actually.

937
01:07:21,125 --> 01:07:22,986
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the same developer that put out Wet.

938
01:07:24,646 --> 01:07:28,767
[SPEAKER_08]: Looking in our chatroom, of course, they are still hung up on the talking to girl game.

939
01:07:29,247 --> 01:07:32,668
[SPEAKER_08]: TigerClaw says they probably have a version for the girls on how to talk to guys.

940
01:07:33,169 --> 01:07:34,009
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think they need one.

941
01:07:34,069 --> 01:07:35,309
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just with your tits.

942
01:07:35,529 --> 01:07:37,010
[SPEAKER_08]: That's basically how they do it.

943
01:07:37,050 --> 01:07:37,650
[SPEAKER_08]: Right, DarkSakura?

944
01:07:40,342 --> 01:07:42,763
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just two buttons, giggle, flash, tits.

945
01:07:44,604 --> 01:07:46,245
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just two buttons, giggle and tits.

946
01:07:47,385 --> 01:07:52,047
[SPEAKER_08]: Bauer CTU in our chatroom says, are one of the choices, are you poopy girl?

947
01:07:53,648 --> 01:07:53,868
[SPEAKER_08]: Lol.

948
01:07:54,861 --> 01:07:55,421
[SPEAKER_08]: See, I like that.

949
01:07:55,461 --> 01:07:57,882
[SPEAKER_08]: Taking it back to a previous topic in the show.

950
01:07:58,282 --> 01:07:58,682
[SPEAKER_08]: Good job.

951
01:07:59,322 --> 01:08:01,282
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyhow, going on to some other stories.

952
01:08:01,362 --> 01:08:02,603
[SPEAKER_08]: Brutal Legend, of course.

953
01:08:03,203 --> 01:08:04,563
[SPEAKER_08]: How has Brutal Legend sales been?

954
01:08:04,743 --> 01:08:05,763
[SPEAKER_08]: They've been like okay, right?

955
01:08:05,783 --> 01:08:07,024
[SPEAKER_08]: They've been alright.

956
01:08:07,284 --> 01:08:09,404
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, hopefully this will invigorate sales a little bit.

957
01:08:09,464 --> 01:08:14,485
[SPEAKER_08]: A new download content piece called The Hammer of Infinite Fate is coming out this week on December 17th.

958
01:08:15,525 --> 01:08:22,387
[SPEAKER_08]: It is a chance for you getting to, I guess, carve a giant disembodied head into Mount Rockmore.

959
01:08:23,127 --> 01:08:26,069
[SPEAKER_08]: of Tim Schafer, the developer of Brutal Legend.

960
01:08:26,289 --> 01:08:27,469
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess that's what you get.

961
01:08:27,549 --> 01:08:27,850
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

962
01:08:28,610 --> 01:08:38,575
[SPEAKER_08]: You also get an upgrade that shows every collectible that's on the map and some new outfits for Eddie and what's probably a highlight for a lot of people, four new multiplayer maps.

963
01:08:38,635 --> 01:08:47,800
[SPEAKER_08]: It's going to cost you $4.99 on PS3, yet $6 on the Xbox 360, but that might be an error because usually those things are the same.

964
01:08:48,520 --> 01:08:52,964
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, if you still haven't picked up DJ Hero, a place you could probably grab it is the Guitar Hero store.

965
01:08:53,304 --> 01:08:54,565
[SPEAKER_08]: It got knocked down to $79.

966
01:08:55,245 --> 01:09:01,130
[SPEAKER_08]: From what I understand, though, this thing got sold out very soon, so I don't think you can actually get this anymore.

967
01:09:01,470 --> 01:09:08,935
[SPEAKER_08]: But it is still telling and worthy of reporting on that the price is already coming down, meaning that maybe it's just a matter of time before this ends up in the bargain bins.

968
01:09:09,016 --> 01:09:09,436
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

969
01:09:09,676 --> 01:09:17,021
[SPEAKER_06]: And as I tweeted earlier this week, the MPD numbers came out and it's sold 303,000 units total.

970
01:09:17,061 --> 01:09:18,082
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, now that's not bad.

971
01:09:18,523 --> 01:09:18,943
[SPEAKER_06]: In two months?

972
01:09:18,963 --> 01:09:19,543
[SPEAKER_06]: No, it's not bad.

973
01:09:19,583 --> 01:09:20,284
[SPEAKER_06]: That's not bad at all.

974
01:09:20,324 --> 01:09:22,405
[SPEAKER_06]: Or actually, technically one month, about.

975
01:09:22,445 --> 01:09:23,406
[SPEAKER_06]: One month and a week or so.

976
01:09:23,426 --> 01:09:25,308
[SPEAKER_08]: It'll probably still sell a little more before Christmas.

977
01:09:25,328 --> 01:09:27,189
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you think it's worthy enough of getting a sequel then?

978
01:09:27,731 --> 01:09:29,652
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah.

979
01:09:29,812 --> 01:09:31,312
[SPEAKER_08]: And Guitar Hero rocks the 80s?

980
01:09:31,552 --> 01:09:32,272
[SPEAKER_08]: Or spins the 80s?

981
01:09:32,332 --> 01:09:32,732
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sorry.

982
01:09:33,813 --> 01:09:34,193
[SPEAKER_08]: I forget.

983
01:09:34,213 --> 01:09:35,733
[SPEAKER_08]: Joke gone wrong.

984
01:09:35,933 --> 01:09:36,794
[SPEAKER_06]: I would be all over that.

985
01:09:36,814 --> 01:09:37,694
[SPEAKER_06]: That'd be pretty awesome.

986
01:09:37,734 --> 01:09:45,356
[SPEAKER_06]: But no, my problem with DJ Hero, and it's the same problem that I have with the Guitar Hero series, is there's not enough download content.

987
01:09:45,396 --> 01:09:47,877
[SPEAKER_06]: We've had two so far.

988
01:09:48,297 --> 01:09:49,377
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, come on, man.

989
01:09:49,397 --> 01:09:51,378
[SPEAKER_06]: Both have been pretty good for what it's worth.

990
01:09:51,418 --> 01:09:56,299
[SPEAKER_06]: But if this was a Harmonix game, I'd be getting download content every fucking week.

991
01:09:58,348 --> 01:09:59,369
[SPEAKER_08]: Rock Band 2, The Best Buy Demo

992
01:10:17,827 --> 01:10:18,287
[SPEAKER_08]: Street Fighter Alpha

993
01:10:35,020 --> 01:11:02,471
[SPEAKER_08]: as well as the arcade version of Shinobi and Rayman for the DSi which I thought was kind of interesting is now out so that's a big title on DSi lots of other stuff available on DSi including Ball Fighter, Pop Island, Army Defender and My Notebook not a lot of exciting stuff on WiiWare but of course the Virtual Console got the arcade version of Shinobi and Street Fighter Alpha for the Super Nintendo so if you were a fan of Alpha back in the day you might want to go grab that

994
01:11:03,191 --> 01:11:03,674
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura

995
01:11:07,645 --> 01:11:12,847
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, in other news, we have something that actually I'm pretty considering trying out.

996
01:11:13,287 --> 01:11:17,748
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a Voltron game on the iPhone and apparently has the best unpause feature.

997
01:11:19,809 --> 01:11:23,850
[SPEAKER_04]: It's actually being put out for the 25th anniversary of the series.

998
01:11:24,470 --> 01:11:36,254
[SPEAKER_04]: So you've got 30 levels, 6 acts total, where you go, you play as the lions going through the galaxy to stop Zarkon and everybody and, you know, all the weapons and everything.

999
01:11:38,917 --> 01:12:05,258
[SPEAKER_04]: and um it's actually uh supposed to be i think pretty neat but um there's a video up here actually that i can um i haven't watched it yet but apparently the the unpause sound effect is supposed to be amazing are they i imagine they're like rips from voltron or something probably i'm gonna check this out all right because i'm i oh there's stupid ads

1000
01:12:06,707 --> 01:12:07,507
[SPEAKER_08]: So now let's go back to Voltron.

1001
01:12:37,151 --> 01:12:38,732
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, someone talking about it.

1002
01:12:43,056 --> 01:12:43,997
[SPEAKER_08]: Blah, blah, blah, blah.

1003
01:12:44,057 --> 01:12:44,537
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, there we go.

1004
01:12:46,939 --> 01:12:48,440
[SPEAKER_04]: See, no one can hear any of this.

1005
01:12:49,561 --> 01:12:50,822
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm trying to find the unpause.

1006
01:12:55,286 --> 01:12:56,427
[SPEAKER_04]: So, it's the sound effects.

1007
01:12:59,409 --> 01:13:04,513
[SPEAKER_04]: It sounds like the music in the game is actually from... Dude, you have Sven when you start off.

1008
01:13:04,533 --> 01:13:04,993
[SPEAKER_04]: That's cool.

1009
01:13:05,494 --> 01:13:05,714
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway...

1010
01:13:06,846 --> 01:13:09,728
[SPEAKER_04]: Moving forward, how about some rock band stuff?

1011
01:13:10,388 --> 01:13:10,828
[SPEAKER_04]: Rock band.

1012
01:13:11,789 --> 01:13:12,509
[SPEAKER_04]: Rubber Soul!

1013
01:13:12,790 --> 01:13:13,330
[SPEAKER_04]: Finally!

1014
01:13:13,870 --> 01:13:15,291
[SPEAKER_04]: Finally, finally, finally.

1015
01:13:15,431 --> 01:13:17,732
[SPEAKER_04]: Very happy, because that's my favorite Beatles album.

1016
01:13:18,693 --> 01:13:23,376
[SPEAKER_04]: So, we are going to be getting Rubber Soul next week for a Beatles rock band.

1017
01:13:25,637 --> 01:13:26,858
[SPEAKER_04]: Because we already got Sgt.

1018
01:13:26,898 --> 01:13:28,839
[SPEAKER_04]: Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band and Abbey Road.

1019
01:13:29,479 --> 01:13:29,800
[SPEAKER_04]: And then...

1020
01:13:31,801 --> 01:13:35,563
[SPEAKER_04]: We are also going to be for the other Rock Band.

1021
01:13:35,583 --> 01:13:39,224
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll be getting All-American Rejects, 30 Seconds to Mars, and more Green Day.

1022
01:13:40,244 --> 01:13:47,728
[SPEAKER_04]: And Rock Band unplugged download content is... I'm not sure.

1023
01:13:50,028 --> 01:13:54,410
[SPEAKER_04]: It actually isn't going to be getting any more download content from what it seems.

1024
01:13:54,950 --> 01:13:56,051
[SPEAKER_04]: So, that's it.

1025
01:13:57,199 --> 01:14:00,721
[SPEAKER_08]: By the way, some late-breaking news, I believe, speaking of the whole Rock Band thing.

1026
01:14:00,761 --> 01:14:08,645
[SPEAKER_08]: Apparently, there's this teaser going on on MTV.com about this whole, I guess, Green Day Rock Band game.

1027
01:14:08,705 --> 01:14:11,627
[SPEAKER_08]: Is there possibly a Rock Band game going on with Green Day in it?

1028
01:14:11,647 --> 01:14:14,069
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think it's going to be as big as, like, Beatles Rock Band.

1029
01:14:14,109 --> 01:14:15,829
[SPEAKER_06]: It may be, like, an add-on content thing.

1030
01:14:16,470 --> 01:14:20,792
[SPEAKER_08]: And we've speculated this before, like the ACDC game was.

1031
01:14:21,112 --> 01:14:21,333
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1032
01:14:21,473 --> 01:14:21,653
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

1033
01:14:23,595 --> 01:14:28,840
[SPEAKER_08]: This might be something that actually shows up during the VGAs, which I guess are happening later tonight.

1034
01:14:28,920 --> 01:14:33,545
[SPEAKER_06]: Green Day is okay, but do you really think they're popular enough to warrant their own game?

1035
01:14:34,326 --> 01:14:36,568
[SPEAKER_06]: You've got to live up to the Beatles.

1036
01:14:36,989 --> 01:14:37,189
[SPEAKER_06]: That's...

1037
01:14:38,359 --> 01:14:39,180
[SPEAKER_08]: VGA's are on tonight

1038
01:15:13,766 --> 01:15:14,386
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1039
01:15:37,493 --> 01:15:41,494
[SPEAKER_08]: I find it odd that I host this show and I know really very little about what's going on here.

1040
01:15:41,554 --> 01:15:43,955
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm very curious to see it.

1041
01:15:43,995 --> 01:15:44,515
[SPEAKER_08]: So there you go.

1042
01:15:46,375 --> 01:15:46,815
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's see.

1043
01:15:49,756 --> 01:15:53,497
[SPEAKER_08]: Some people talking about listening to the show or not listening to the show tonight.

1044
01:15:53,957 --> 01:15:54,497
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's see.

1045
01:15:54,617 --> 01:16:00,279
[SPEAKER_08]: Going to Leo Shen on Twitter says, Any songs from a recent game that you can't get out of your head?

1046
01:16:00,699 --> 01:16:04,060
[SPEAKER_08]: For me it's Bayonetta's Fly Me to the Moon Climax Mix.

1047
01:16:05,498 --> 01:16:06,439
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought that was kind of funny.

1048
01:16:07,420 --> 01:16:10,263
[SPEAKER_06]: My friend's like, hey, isn't this from Neo Genesis?

1049
01:16:10,623 --> 01:16:14,207
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, and a bunch of other stuff.

1050
01:16:14,227 --> 01:16:17,250
[SPEAKER_06]: Awesome game.

1051
01:16:20,058 --> 01:16:23,221
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know if I have a song stuck in my head, especially not one from a video game.

1052
01:16:23,481 --> 01:16:29,788
[SPEAKER_08]: For the longest time, though, I had that mix of Radio Gaga and Mary J. Blige from the download of DJ Hero.

1053
01:16:29,808 --> 01:16:31,470
[SPEAKER_08]: That would get stuck in my head so easily.

1054
01:16:31,510 --> 01:16:36,535
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot of the stuff from DJ Hero is stuck in my head because I played in my car on repeat, basically.

1055
01:16:36,775 --> 01:16:41,060
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot of bus moves around the world, you know?

1056
01:16:41,684 --> 01:16:42,525
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a good mix.

1057
01:16:42,545 --> 01:16:44,786
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a game I haven't played in forever that I really need to.

1058
01:16:46,228 --> 01:16:48,629
[SPEAKER_08]: Old school, bust a move, groove, whatever you want to call it.

1059
01:16:49,850 --> 01:16:50,271
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's see.

1060
01:16:50,391 --> 01:17:01,159
[SPEAKER_08]: Also, SSJ100Matt on Twitter is saying, Target is having some nice game deals starting this Sunday, including DJ Hero $88 and Zelda Spirit Tracks $25.

1061
01:17:01,219 --> 01:17:05,162
[SPEAKER_06]: That was another game I forgot to mention that I was playing this week.

1062
01:17:06,143 --> 01:17:08,765
[SPEAKER_06]: It's alright, but my thing is...

1063
01:17:10,498 --> 01:17:18,282
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not the same as the other games where the method of travel by boat was kind of a necessity.

1064
01:17:18,982 --> 01:17:23,944
[SPEAKER_06]: The fact that they're like, oh no, we can't go to these parts of the land because the tracks have disappeared.

1065
01:17:24,245 --> 01:17:27,966
[SPEAKER_06]: That's just to me saying, I'm lazy and I don't want to walk there.

1066
01:17:28,987 --> 01:17:33,569
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like fucking walking was all you did in Zelda, Zelda 2, Zelda 3 even.

1067
01:17:36,226 --> 01:17:40,231
[SPEAKER_01]: But now I'm too good for walking, I need to take a train everywhere.

1068
01:17:51,508 --> 01:17:52,549
[SPEAKER_06]: I want another Wind Waker

1069
01:18:13,484 --> 01:18:15,005
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, they keep putting out these DS games.

1070
01:18:15,065 --> 01:18:18,448
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's do another GameCube-style game or whatever, because Wind Waker is awesome.

1071
01:18:18,468 --> 01:18:19,568
[SPEAKER_06]: I need to go back and actually play it.

1072
01:18:19,588 --> 01:18:22,811
[SPEAKER_07]: A lot of people disagree with you, but... Well... They can suck it, right?

1073
01:18:23,111 --> 01:18:24,412
[SPEAKER_06]: They can suck it, because guess what?

1074
01:18:24,792 --> 01:18:28,935
[SPEAKER_06]: How many games have we seen that have been emulating the Wind Waker style being released?

1075
01:18:29,035 --> 01:18:30,056
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, at least two of them.

1076
01:18:30,376 --> 01:18:35,000
[SPEAKER_06]: How many games have we seen emulating the style of the Marie Lissig Zelda?

1077
01:18:35,960 --> 01:18:36,060
[SPEAKER_06]: One.

1078
01:18:37,641 --> 01:18:38,242
[SPEAKER_06]: So tough.

1079
01:18:39,011 --> 01:18:39,972
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, well we'll see.

1080
01:18:40,052 --> 01:18:41,813
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, that's it for Twitter topics tonight.

1081
01:18:42,073 --> 01:18:44,254
[SPEAKER_08]: Twitter.com slash OLR if you want to give us a follow.

1082
01:18:44,655 --> 01:18:48,077
[SPEAKER_08]: Meanwhile, back to some more gaming news and then our mailbag before too long.

1083
01:18:49,636 --> 01:19:00,238
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, there's a new patent that's been put out for the Sony motion controller and it's showing a new feature including swappable buttons or like some sort of connector.

1084
01:19:00,658 --> 01:19:10,440
[SPEAKER_06]: Basically, at the top of the controller or possibly even the bottom, I don't know, they show this kind of like upside down with the cosmic ice cream cone facing down.

1085
01:19:11,480 --> 01:19:16,921
[SPEAKER_06]: Apparently, there is a little spot that you could possibly put in either a D-pad, they have like the...

1086
01:19:19,039 --> 01:19:20,480
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1087
01:19:48,311 --> 01:19:51,813
[SPEAKER_06]: But honestly, I don't see what the point is in adding face buttons to it.

1088
01:19:51,913 --> 01:19:59,076
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, when you just have some generic buttons and if you want to use them... I don't know, it gives some more diversity for the developers.

1089
01:19:59,197 --> 01:20:01,658
[SPEAKER_08]: I would just worry about losing that shit.

1090
01:20:01,758 --> 01:20:02,798
[SPEAKER_08]: Those things look small.

1091
01:20:02,918 --> 01:20:05,260
[SPEAKER_08]: I would think losing them would be the problem.

1092
01:20:05,680 --> 01:20:07,100
[SPEAKER_08]: These little convertible things.

1093
01:20:07,301 --> 01:20:17,045
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, not only that, but I would think, though, that the directional pad or whatever could be easily done with just four buttons like the face buttons, so there's no need to double up on that.

1094
01:20:17,106 --> 01:20:17,866
[SPEAKER_06]: And the jog dial...

1095
01:20:19,864 --> 01:20:21,585
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't really see why they would need that.

1096
01:20:24,386 --> 01:20:26,968
[SPEAKER_08]: To spin the wheel in a Wheel of Fortune game, I don't know.

1097
01:20:27,548 --> 01:20:30,350
[SPEAKER_06]: But they make the movement with the whole motion controller.

1098
01:20:31,690 --> 01:20:41,016
[SPEAKER_06]: This is about, like, I don't know if you saw the article about Ubisoft with their crappy camera that they put out with that Your Self Fitness thing or whatever.

1099
01:20:41,536 --> 01:20:42,616
[SPEAKER_06]: Your Shape, actually.

1100
01:20:43,777 --> 01:20:49,160
[SPEAKER_06]: And they have a new racquetball game coming out to kind of compete with Wii Sports, Tennis, or whatever.

1101
01:20:49,561 --> 01:20:52,322
[SPEAKER_06]: And it uses, as an option, it uses the camera.

1102
01:20:52,663 --> 01:20:56,205
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, all the previews I've seen using this camera have been crap.

1103
01:20:57,025 --> 01:20:59,947
[SPEAKER_08]: Toagak in chat says, Have you ever dealt with a DS game card before?

1104
01:21:00,027 --> 01:21:01,068
[SPEAKER_08]: Those are easy to lose.

1105
01:21:01,608 --> 01:21:05,050
[SPEAKER_08]: Like saying that, you know, well, these things aren't much bigger than a DS card, probably.

1106
01:21:05,150 --> 01:21:08,552
[SPEAKER_08]: So if you can keep track of a DS game card, you can probably keep track of these little things.

1107
01:21:09,313 --> 01:21:09,573
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe.

1108
01:21:10,373 --> 01:21:12,735
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe, but like, there's got to be an easier way to do this.

1109
01:21:14,639 --> 01:21:16,983
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, and it doesn't necessarily mean it's going to be true.

1110
01:21:17,264 --> 01:21:23,154
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, it's just generally patents so that no patent whores try to get in there and, you know, patent it first.

1111
01:21:23,534 --> 01:21:25,097
[SPEAKER_06]: I will just sue them 10 years down the road.

1112
01:21:25,177 --> 01:21:26,600
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, they always seem to do that.

1113
01:21:27,828 --> 01:21:38,538
[SPEAKER_08]: Star Trek Online is coming out next year, and of course there's quite a few people excited about that, including our very own DarkSakura, and I gotta admit, I am pretty excited about it too, even though I'm a big WoW whore, and I gotta say, lovin' the new patch 3.3.

1114
01:21:39,179 --> 01:21:40,440
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't say this during my gaming week.

1115
01:21:40,560 --> 01:21:42,022
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, I like it too.

1116
01:21:42,102 --> 01:21:48,288
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I've noticed that it flashes red now when you're being attacked, and it's sort of like, what the hell?

1117
01:21:48,588 --> 01:21:49,869
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I'm being attacked!

1118
01:21:50,249 --> 01:21:51,711
[SPEAKER_04]: Instead of just random roar...

1119
01:21:52,111 --> 01:21:55,913
[SPEAKER_08]: And the quest tracking thing, if you didn't have a mod for that before, is pretty awesome.

1120
01:21:56,273 --> 01:21:58,094
[SPEAKER_08]: I used a quest helper mod, so I already had that.

1121
01:21:58,214 --> 01:22:02,276
[SPEAKER_08]: And I gotta say, this whole dungeon finder is awesome.

1122
01:22:02,696 --> 01:22:03,577
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah!

1123
01:22:03,657 --> 01:22:05,938
[SPEAKER_08]: All the looking for group stuff is gone now.

1124
01:22:06,258 --> 01:22:07,059
[SPEAKER_08]: It's crazy.

1125
01:22:07,439 --> 01:22:11,941
[SPEAKER_08]: And I gotta be honest, all the groups I've gotten through the system have been really good.

1126
01:22:12,401 --> 01:22:15,843
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, I have yet to get a group full of douchebags like I used to get before.

1127
01:22:15,943 --> 01:22:16,723
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know what it is.

1128
01:22:17,184 --> 01:22:21,466
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not like they have a filter on what kind of players get to use the group system, but...

1129
01:22:21,966 --> 01:22:23,567
[SPEAKER_08]: I've just gotten a lot of really good players.

1130
01:22:23,907 --> 01:22:27,069
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe that it requires a little bit more intelligence to use it?

1131
01:22:27,549 --> 01:22:27,929
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

1132
01:22:28,290 --> 01:22:28,590
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

1133
01:22:28,630 --> 01:22:29,390
[SPEAKER_08]: Very, very exciting.

1134
01:22:29,450 --> 01:22:31,631
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway, but we want to get back to Star Trek Online.

1135
01:22:32,132 --> 01:22:36,994
[SPEAKER_08]: Star Trek Online, of course, is coming out soon and a whole shitload of pre-order bonuses.

1136
01:22:37,074 --> 01:22:40,716
[SPEAKER_08]: But of course, it depends on where you pre-order it.

1137
01:22:40,756 --> 01:22:41,257
[SPEAKER_08]: That's right.

1138
01:22:42,097 --> 01:22:45,718
[SPEAKER_08]: And depending on where you pre-order, Star Trek Online will change the bonus that you get.

1139
01:22:46,098 --> 01:22:51,099
[SPEAKER_08]: So, for example, if you pre-order the game at GameStop, you can have the classic USS Enterprise.

1140
01:22:51,359 --> 01:22:53,040
[SPEAKER_08]: You can only get the classic Enterprise at GameStop.

1141
01:22:53,440 --> 01:22:56,320
[SPEAKER_06]: So there's going to be everybody riding around the USS Enterprise.

1142
01:22:56,840 --> 01:22:57,220
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess.

1143
01:22:57,360 --> 01:22:57,681
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

1144
01:22:58,661 --> 01:23:02,562
[SPEAKER_08]: At the Best Buy, you can get a Pet Tribble or a Targ, depending on what your faction is.

1145
01:23:02,622 --> 01:23:03,762
[SPEAKER_06]: Dude, totally want a Targ.

1146
01:23:05,026 --> 01:23:27,249
[SPEAKER_08]: and everybody knows when you get one pet tribble it's actually hundreds of pet tribbles if you pre-order on Amazon you get a liberated Borg bridge officer with unique nanotechnology augmentation so in other words you can have sex of nine as your bridge officer there whose name is Poopy I actually totally think that I'm going to get mine on Amazon now because I've actually got a gift card for Amazon do you really?

1147
01:23:30,294 --> 01:23:34,480
[SPEAKER_08]: Direct2Drive, a multi-spatial personal shield.

1148
01:23:34,801 --> 01:23:36,784
[SPEAKER_08]: It regenerates itself and the player health.

1149
01:23:40,034 --> 01:23:41,616
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1150
01:24:02,237 --> 01:24:04,341
[SPEAKER_08]: Those are all game-changing items.

1151
01:24:04,361 --> 01:24:09,932
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a little weird to me that depending on where you buy the game can kind of change up the game for you.

1152
01:24:11,311 --> 01:24:16,273
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I imagine even these little items they talk about aren't like the best things in the game.

1153
01:24:16,614 --> 01:24:19,875
[SPEAKER_08]: It seems to me, I gotta be honest, it sounds, the Walmart one sounds good.

1154
01:24:19,935 --> 01:24:26,378
[SPEAKER_08]: If you get extra skill points that you can't get any other way, that seems like the best deal right there.

1155
01:24:26,418 --> 01:24:29,820
[SPEAKER_04]: But it seems to me, though, that, well, are they completely unique?

1156
01:24:29,840 --> 01:24:31,141
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, does it say specific?

1157
01:24:31,601 --> 01:24:36,143
[SPEAKER_04]: Because, I mean, if you can get skill points as you keep going, you know, as you level, then what's the point?

1158
01:24:36,503 --> 01:24:39,205
[SPEAKER_06]: What kind of skills can you get from Walmart anyways?

1159
01:24:39,305 --> 01:24:39,465
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean...

1160
01:24:41,346 --> 01:24:42,486
[SPEAKER_04]: Out of Dress.

1161
01:24:42,646 --> 01:24:47,609
[SPEAKER_04]: Which one had the, what was it, the transphasic shield?

1162
01:24:48,950 --> 01:24:51,992
[SPEAKER_08]: Direct to Drive has the shield that regenerates itself in your health.

1163
01:24:53,072 --> 01:24:54,833
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I can imagine a Walmart bonus being like,

1164
01:24:56,089 --> 01:25:02,257
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, you get to command the Enterprise, except the Enterprise has a new paint job with a Confederate flag on it.

1165
01:25:04,080 --> 01:25:10,248
[SPEAKER_04]: Honestly, I think I wouldn't really want the classic Enterprise anyway, because given when the game is set, it's like driving...

1166
01:25:13,706 --> 01:25:14,246
[SPEAKER_08]: A hooptie.

1167
01:25:14,346 --> 01:25:17,688
[SPEAKER_08]: I gotta be honest, the GameStop pre-order sounds the least interesting to me.

1168
01:25:17,728 --> 01:25:18,388
[SPEAKER_08]: I've gotta be honest.

1169
01:25:18,648 --> 01:25:21,770
[SPEAKER_08]: This is Star Trek Online, not remake Star Trek The Next Generation.

1170
01:25:22,030 --> 01:25:28,974
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it'd be the equivalent of everyone driving around in a brand new Bugatti, right?

1171
01:25:29,494 --> 01:25:32,715
[SPEAKER_04]: And you're driving a 1983 Ford Escort.

1172
01:25:34,556 --> 01:25:34,796
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.

1173
01:25:35,117 --> 01:25:35,637
[SPEAKER_04]: Seriously.

1174
01:25:36,737 --> 01:25:37,678
[SPEAKER_06]: A Geo Metro.

1175
01:25:38,311 --> 01:25:42,954
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm a pet whore though, and wow, so I'm almost down for this Best Buy pet Tribble.

1176
01:25:43,094 --> 01:25:43,934
[SPEAKER_08]: That sounds kind of awesome.

1177
01:25:44,095 --> 01:25:46,316
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that the only way you're going to be able to get this pet Tribble?

1178
01:25:46,356 --> 01:25:49,598
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, is there going to be a Tribble wearing a Best Buy shirt or something like that?

1179
01:25:49,977 --> 01:25:50,458
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't know.

1180
01:25:50,478 --> 01:25:57,366
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't get a... And besides that, the whole... You can... Although I'm sure the Tribbles are actually 90% reproductive organs.

1181
01:25:59,348 --> 01:26:02,472
[SPEAKER_04]: You can just feed them very little and they won't have enough energy to breed.

1182
01:26:02,632 --> 01:26:05,415
[SPEAKER_08]: A few comments from our chatroom at chat.orange.com on this story.

1183
01:26:05,635 --> 01:26:08,639
[SPEAKER_08]: Vanis Lux says, Exclusive Walmart greeter class.

1184
01:26:08,959 --> 01:26:09,919
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe that's what you get at Walmart.

1185
01:26:10,540 --> 01:26:19,704
[SPEAKER_08]: SalaciousPop says, you're not going to know how or what to min to max if you're just starting, and 99% of the MMOs nerf a lot of stuff within the first 90 days.

1186
01:26:20,564 --> 01:26:25,567
[SPEAKER_08]: SSJ100Matt says, you can probably buy those devices and armor bonuses in some sort of store in the game.

1187
01:26:26,267 --> 01:26:28,448
[SPEAKER_08]: And BauerCTU says, I want the Classic Enterprise.

1188
01:26:30,307 --> 01:26:31,907
[SPEAKER_08]: So, you know, screw what I think.

1189
01:26:32,348 --> 01:26:40,470
[SPEAKER_08]: No, obviously there will be a lot of people that want it, and there'll probably be a lot of them in-game, because GameStop is obviously still a very, very big retailer where a lot of people are going to get this.

1190
01:26:41,090 --> 01:26:47,772
[SPEAKER_08]: But just so you know, there's choices, so if Star Trek Online is really important to you, you might want to think around about where you pre-order the game.

1191
01:26:48,752 --> 01:26:52,073
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll probably end up getting it on Steam, so I don't have to go outside the house, but we'll see.

1192
01:26:52,333 --> 01:26:52,653
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura

1193
01:27:11,912 --> 01:27:39,037
[SPEAKER_04]: well in other stuff yay other stuff thanks Rob PS3 actually won Metacritic's console of the year they did a big survey on it and actually the higher rated games came out higher rated games were on Xbox 360 than PS3 but the winner overall though was still the PS3

1194
01:27:40,948 --> 01:27:42,389
[SPEAKER_04]: Which is kind of crap.

1195
01:27:42,409 --> 01:27:45,471
[SPEAKER_04]: But then again, Uncharted 2, you know, meh.

1196
01:27:47,193 --> 01:27:49,635
[SPEAKER_04]: And the Wii did okay on the thing too.

1197
01:27:49,755 --> 01:27:57,881
[SPEAKER_04]: But I mean, and also to keep going further into the list though, the best rated Xbox game was Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2.

1198
01:27:58,881 --> 01:28:00,943
[SPEAKER_04]: And Metroid Prime Trilogy was on Wii.

1199
01:28:01,023 --> 01:28:03,465
[SPEAKER_04]: Street Fighter 4 scored the best for PC.

1200
01:28:03,925 --> 01:28:06,847
[SPEAKER_04]: Grand Theft Auto Chinatown Wars was number one on PSP and DS.

1201
01:28:07,508 --> 01:28:07,588
[SPEAKER_04]: So.

1202
01:28:09,702 --> 01:28:21,289
[SPEAKER_08]: This seems like one of those stories that's just there to start a controversy, to get the Sony fanboys and the Microsoft fanboys all riled up.

1203
01:28:21,970 --> 01:28:24,211
[SPEAKER_08]: But it's been a good year for Sony.

1204
01:28:24,271 --> 01:28:30,495
[SPEAKER_08]: The price drop was what they needed to do three years ago, and it's finally bringing a lot of people on board.

1205
01:28:30,515 --> 01:28:32,036
[SPEAKER_08]: And I've heard a lot of people talk about...

1206
01:28:32,416 --> 01:28:35,977
[SPEAKER_08]: How they're probably going to take the plunge and get the PS3 now, you know, with Blu-ray and so forth.

1207
01:28:36,617 --> 01:28:38,477
[SPEAKER_08]: I think they're going to have a really good Christmas season.

1208
01:28:38,517 --> 01:28:39,858
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, we'll see when the numbers come out.

1209
01:28:40,418 --> 01:28:41,978
[SPEAKER_08]: Certainly Microsoft's not out.

1210
01:28:42,498 --> 01:28:42,998
[SPEAKER_08]: Hell no.

1211
01:28:43,659 --> 01:28:45,439
[SPEAKER_08]: They've already sold millions of consoles.

1212
01:28:45,479 --> 01:28:49,640
[SPEAKER_08]: I think this is going to be, I think there's going to be a lot of people that just simply have more than one console in this day and age.

1213
01:28:50,040 --> 01:28:50,240
[SPEAKER_08]: You know?

1214
01:28:51,260 --> 01:28:51,400
[SPEAKER_08]: So.

1215
01:28:52,540 --> 01:28:52,801
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright.

1216
01:28:53,721 --> 01:28:54,341
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, let's see.

1217
01:28:54,501 --> 01:28:57,542
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll move on to some more news stories and then we'll get to the mailbag in just a minute here.

1218
01:28:58,142 --> 01:28:58,342
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

1219
01:28:59,222 --> 01:28:59,342
[SPEAKER_06]: Um.

1220
01:29:00,396 --> 01:29:01,217
[SPEAKER_06]: So this is kind of neat.

1221
01:29:01,617 --> 01:29:11,705
[SPEAKER_06]: We had a game that just came out, Avatar, that supported 3D with, you know, actually stereoscopic 3D with TVs that supported, you know, 3D gaming.

1222
01:29:12,806 --> 01:29:14,787
[SPEAKER_06]: Some of the 120 megahertz TVs.

1223
01:29:15,028 --> 01:29:16,469
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that because movies are supposed to be in 3D too?

1224
01:29:16,869 --> 01:29:17,970
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, it is.

1225
01:29:18,731 --> 01:29:24,017
[SPEAKER_06]: It's kind of neat, though, because Avatar, actually, it was... It's dependent on which TV it is.

1226
01:29:24,037 --> 01:29:34,307
[SPEAKER_06]: They had a bunch of different options that you could do, including Real D was one of those, which you find in a lot of the cinemas nowadays, which is the polarized glasses.

1227
01:29:34,788 --> 01:29:35,008
[SPEAKER_06]: Well...

1228
01:29:36,104 --> 01:29:36,865
[SPEAKER_06]: Soul Calibur V

1229
01:29:55,051 --> 01:29:56,471
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know, but it's neat.

1230
01:29:56,792 --> 01:29:58,552
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, and I think this is the way games are going to go.

1231
01:29:58,592 --> 01:30:00,793
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, but how many TVs are fitted for this?

1232
01:30:00,873 --> 01:30:01,593
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean... Not many.

1233
01:30:02,113 --> 01:30:05,794
[SPEAKER_06]: And the thing is, not only do you have to have these TVs, you have to have those glasses, too.

1234
01:30:05,954 --> 01:30:08,235
[SPEAKER_06]: So, the Real D wouldn't be bad.

1235
01:30:08,355 --> 01:30:14,177
[SPEAKER_06]: If you could do the Real D stuff, like, on your TV, I mean, because that's just a... It's polarized glasses.

1236
01:30:14,197 --> 01:30:16,717
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, those glasses cost, like, five bucks.

1237
01:30:16,777 --> 01:30:18,618
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, that would be, I think, the way to go.

1238
01:30:18,938 --> 01:30:21,919
[SPEAKER_06]: When you get the more expensive, like, shutter glasses, you know, they're actual...

1239
01:30:22,816 --> 01:30:25,018
[SPEAKER_06]: Hardware that have timing and everything.

1240
01:30:25,918 --> 01:30:30,722
[SPEAKER_06]: That might be a little bit difficult, but I think it's almost like pushing the technology too quick.

1241
01:30:30,762 --> 01:30:33,844
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, we just got people sort of adopted to HDTVs.

1242
01:30:34,004 --> 01:30:35,506
[SPEAKER_08]: Not everybody's kind of on board with that.

1243
01:30:35,666 --> 01:30:38,067
[SPEAKER_08]: I can't believe this Avatar game's already supporting it.

1244
01:30:38,087 --> 01:30:39,188
[SPEAKER_08]: It seems so early.

1245
01:30:40,109 --> 01:30:41,590
[SPEAKER_08]: I hear it's good, though.

1246
01:30:41,610 --> 01:30:46,434
[SPEAKER_08]: I hear that Avatar's whole thing is really pushing what they do with cinema now, but...

1247
01:30:46,974 --> 01:30:47,214
[SPEAKER_08]: Man.

1248
01:30:47,535 --> 01:30:59,724
[SPEAKER_08]: And by the way, Tigerclaws, Lincoln and Chad, apparently, even though I was bagging on the movie a little bit last week about how I kind of don't look interested in it, Avatar the movie apparently has an 89% on Rotten Tomatoes right now.

1249
01:31:00,324 --> 01:31:03,006
[SPEAKER_08]: So, I guess some people are being pretty wowed by it.

1250
01:31:03,587 --> 01:31:04,167
[SPEAKER_06]: By the game?

1251
01:31:04,808 --> 01:31:05,508
[SPEAKER_08]: No, the movie.

1252
01:31:05,528 --> 01:31:05,748
[SPEAKER_06]: The movie?

1253
01:31:06,349 --> 01:31:07,029
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not out yet.

1254
01:31:07,710 --> 01:31:11,533
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, it had its premiere in London, so some critics were probably there.

1255
01:31:11,813 --> 01:31:12,914
[SPEAKER_08]: It's probably had its critics screening.

1256
01:31:14,054 --> 01:31:14,235
[SPEAKER_06]: Well...

1257
01:31:15,103 --> 01:31:21,687
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to go see it, and in 3D, because that's the way it's meant to be seen, but if it's crap, then I'll call it.

1258
01:31:21,947 --> 01:31:22,868
[SPEAKER_08]: Are you going to see it by Sunday?

1259
01:31:22,888 --> 01:31:25,289
[SPEAKER_08]: Review it on next week's show?

1260
01:31:26,229 --> 01:31:26,630
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

1261
01:31:26,950 --> 01:31:31,232
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to go see it with my dad, because the wife does not want to see that movie.

1262
01:31:31,452 --> 01:31:32,253
[SPEAKER_06]: I see.

1263
01:31:33,314 --> 01:31:35,355
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think he's gone, so I may not be able to see it.

1264
01:31:35,855 --> 01:31:37,036
[SPEAKER_06]: She may go see it, though.

1265
01:31:37,056 --> 01:31:39,897
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sure some of our chatters will let us know next week, if nothing else.

1266
01:31:39,917 --> 01:31:40,918
[SPEAKER_06]: We're definitely going to see it next week.

1267
01:31:41,626 --> 01:31:43,729
[SPEAKER_08]: I will give you a review of Princess and the Frog next week.

1268
01:31:43,769 --> 01:31:44,610
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to see that tomorrow.

1269
01:31:44,630 --> 01:31:45,512
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to see that too.

1270
01:31:46,033 --> 01:31:47,936
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe you'll see that tomorrow.

1271
01:31:47,976 --> 01:31:49,839
[SPEAKER_08]: That you could probably get the wife to see.

1272
01:31:51,101 --> 01:31:54,386
[SPEAKER_06]: I do remember now she does want to see Avatar because she said it looked neat.

1273
01:31:54,987 --> 01:31:55,468
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, there you go.

1274
01:31:57,372 --> 01:32:03,478
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, let's see, moving on to another story here about something probably the wife wouldn't be interested in at all.

1275
01:32:03,598 --> 01:32:05,180
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know, Loki, maybe she would be.

1276
01:32:05,580 --> 01:32:15,750
[SPEAKER_08]: Bible Adventures is a new game that's coming out from Left Behind Games, which I want to say I remember reporting on the fact that the studio was developed quite some time ago.

1277
01:32:16,711 --> 01:32:18,132
[SPEAKER_08]: Do the Left Behind Game.

1278
01:32:18,352 --> 01:32:18,553
[SPEAKER_08]: Mm-hmm.

1279
01:32:19,628 --> 01:32:22,192
[SPEAKER_08]: So now they're doing Bible Adventures as their new game.

1280
01:32:22,573 --> 01:32:29,163
[SPEAKER_08]: It's going to educate young children by teaching them academic lessons vital to early childhood development through Bible stories.

1281
01:32:29,604 --> 01:32:33,651
[SPEAKER_08]: So in other words, it's gonna be throwing the Bible at them at an early age.

1282
01:32:34,019 --> 01:32:38,021
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I could see this maybe being more of like a downloadable game.

1283
01:32:38,242 --> 01:32:40,383
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, that would be a little bit more popular, I think.

1284
01:32:40,483 --> 01:32:42,324
[SPEAKER_08]: No, it's coming out as an actual game.

1285
01:32:42,344 --> 01:32:43,285
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't want to sell this.

1286
01:32:43,985 --> 01:32:50,089
[SPEAKER_06]: Not that I don't like selling, you know, not to have anything against the Bible or anything, but I don't want to sell that.

1287
01:32:50,169 --> 01:32:52,831
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, just like, you need this because people love the Bible.

1288
01:32:53,752 --> 01:32:56,435
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway, it's based on the Charlie Churchmouse stories.

1289
01:32:56,495 --> 01:33:03,983
[SPEAKER_08]: It's going to span both of the Old and the New Testament, and it will teach mathematics, spelling, and I love this, reasoning skills.

1290
01:33:05,665 --> 01:33:06,626
[SPEAKER_08]: WWJD.

1291
01:33:09,329 --> 01:33:11,332
[SPEAKER_04]: I prefer WWTF.

1292
01:33:11,812 --> 01:33:13,394
[SPEAKER_08]: IDGAF.

1293
01:33:14,762 --> 01:33:15,883
[SPEAKER_08]: WWGD.

1294
01:33:17,064 --> 01:33:28,814
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyhow, the CEO of Left Behind has said that they expect their financial projections to grow exponentially as they transition from a PC game developer to a Wii and Xbox developer.

1295
01:33:28,854 --> 01:33:29,255
[SPEAKER_08]: That's right.

1296
01:33:29,595 --> 01:33:32,618
[SPEAKER_08]: Bible Adventures apparently is coming out for the Wii and the Xbox 360.

1297
01:33:33,398 --> 01:33:34,099
[SPEAKER_08]: And I love this.

1298
01:33:34,819 --> 01:33:40,845
[SPEAKER_08]: Joystick, who ran this story, one of the many sites who ran the story this week, said, but what about PS3 owners?

1299
01:33:41,245 --> 01:33:42,066
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, they can go to hell.

1300
01:33:42,754 --> 01:33:43,695
[SPEAKER_06]: And then the link, though.

1301
01:33:43,775 --> 01:33:45,037
[SPEAKER_08]: The link is for Dante's Inferno.

1302
01:33:45,057 --> 01:33:45,217
[SPEAKER_08]: I know.

1303
01:33:45,237 --> 01:33:45,617
[SPEAKER_08]: I love it.

1304
01:33:46,318 --> 01:33:46,979
[SPEAKER_06]: It's funny.

1305
01:33:47,059 --> 01:33:47,479
[SPEAKER_08]: I lulled.

1306
01:33:49,041 --> 01:33:49,722
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what, though?

1307
01:33:51,263 --> 01:33:53,306
[SPEAKER_08]: Like it or not, there's a market for this stuff.

1308
01:33:55,568 --> 01:33:57,270
[SPEAKER_08]: They'll sell these in those Christian bookstores.

1309
01:33:57,310 --> 01:34:01,775
[SPEAKER_06]: I just want to know when we're getting dance praise or whatever the guitar hero equivalent was.

1310
01:34:01,815 --> 01:34:02,456
[SPEAKER_06]: Guitar praise?

1311
01:34:02,476 --> 01:34:02,876
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I remember that.

1312
01:34:02,896 --> 01:34:03,537
[SPEAKER_06]: Guitar praise or...

1313
01:34:04,944 --> 01:34:06,224
[SPEAKER_06]: DJ Praise.

1314
01:34:06,244 --> 01:34:07,245
[SPEAKER_06]: Where's DJ Praise?

1315
01:34:07,685 --> 01:34:07,865
[SPEAKER_06]: What?

1316
01:34:08,205 --> 01:34:08,945
[SPEAKER_06]: DJ Praise.

1317
01:34:08,965 --> 01:34:09,505
[SPEAKER_08]: DJ Praise?

1318
01:34:10,605 --> 01:34:11,786
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe you should make that game, Loki.

1319
01:34:11,846 --> 01:34:12,626
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I shouldn't.

1320
01:34:14,926 --> 01:34:15,226
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1321
01:34:15,266 --> 01:34:15,966
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyhow, forget it.

1322
01:34:16,327 --> 01:34:17,607
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's move on to the mailbag.

1323
01:34:17,647 --> 01:34:23,048
[SPEAKER_08]: Every week you guys send us emails at mailbag at orangelawnradio.com and DarkSakura jumps into the mailbag head first.

1324
01:34:23,128 --> 01:34:23,688
[SPEAKER_04]: And deletes them.

1325
01:34:23,848 --> 01:34:25,529
[SPEAKER_08]: And instantly deletes them.

1326
01:34:26,149 --> 01:34:31,330
[SPEAKER_08]: But not before she picks out a few of her favorites to read here on the air in a segment we call The Mailbag.

1327
01:34:34,694 --> 01:34:35,996
[SPEAKER_04]: Starting with an awful joke.

1328
01:34:36,316 --> 01:34:37,658
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's from AZHP.

1329
01:34:38,278 --> 01:34:43,444
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi OLR crew, AZHP here celebrating the release of the new Silent Hill Wii game with a crude joke for everyone.

1330
01:34:43,965 --> 01:34:45,426
[SPEAKER_04]: Yay!

1331
01:34:46,187 --> 01:34:50,392
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you call what happens to your boobs after Pyramid Head rapes you?

1332
01:34:50,992 --> 01:34:52,294
[SPEAKER_04]: Silent Hill Shattered Memories.

1333
01:34:54,861 --> 01:35:00,644
[SPEAKER_04]: Now that we've got that out of the way, have you guys heard about the Silent Hill stage play planned for Sweden?

1334
01:35:00,684 --> 01:35:01,444
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, we already did that.

1335
01:35:02,385 --> 01:35:12,270
[SPEAKER_04]: If it's as good as the last Konami spinoff play I wrote into the show about DDR the musical, then I'm sure we can all say that we're extremely excited to see what comes out of this.

1336
01:35:12,670 --> 01:35:18,693
[SPEAKER_04]: There aren't any details besides the flyer, which has been making the rounds on gaming blogs, but it's Silent Hill, so it's plenty enough to get excited about.

1337
01:35:18,733 --> 01:35:19,174
[SPEAKER_04]: Am I right?

1338
01:35:20,154 --> 01:35:22,335
[SPEAKER_04]: TTFN, ta-ta for now, is EHP.

1339
01:35:22,956 --> 01:35:23,676
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, we covered that.

1340
01:35:24,605 --> 01:35:27,986
[SPEAKER_08]: By the way, AZHP, I got this for you for your joke.

1341
01:35:29,427 --> 01:35:29,647
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, wait.

1342
01:35:31,608 --> 01:35:32,488
[SPEAKER_08]: Sound cue fail.

1343
01:35:32,869 --> 01:35:34,589
[SPEAKER_08]: Now this is for me and AZHP.

1344
01:35:39,331 --> 01:35:42,033
[SPEAKER_06]: We just need to get one of those fancy mixing boards with the buttons.

1345
01:35:42,053 --> 01:35:42,473
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, we do.

1346
01:35:42,513 --> 01:35:44,054
[SPEAKER_08]: We need a fancy mixing board with buttons.

1347
01:35:44,094 --> 01:35:44,694
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's get on that.

1348
01:35:45,254 --> 01:35:48,095
[SPEAKER_03]: I will get on that because you already told me what to do.

1349
01:35:50,837 --> 01:35:52,457
[SPEAKER_04]: Next up comes from Gray Fox.

1350
01:35:53,698 --> 01:35:53,958
[SPEAKER_04]: Dear...

1351
01:35:54,679 --> 01:35:55,139
[SPEAKER_04]: OLR.

1352
01:35:55,880 --> 01:35:56,741
[SPEAKER_04]: I need your help.

1353
01:35:57,541 --> 01:35:57,721
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

1354
01:35:58,442 --> 01:35:58,982
[SPEAKER_08]: Give me a dollar.

1355
01:35:59,222 --> 01:36:00,924
[SPEAKER_04]: You're not cheating enough then.

1356
01:36:19,657 --> 01:36:29,760
[SPEAKER_04]: Now with so much of my time being taken up by other interests, I find myself having less time for games and I'm finding myself remembering my relentless quests across Hyrule or summoning some ridiculously large beast in Final Fantasy.

1357
01:36:30,280 --> 01:36:34,101
[SPEAKER_04]: So I've asked myself if other people have encountered the same thing.

1358
01:36:35,162 --> 01:36:35,382
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1359
01:36:37,522 --> 01:36:37,742
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1360
01:36:38,383 --> 01:36:39,823
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't have patience anymore.

1361
01:36:40,954 --> 01:36:42,335
[SPEAKER_08]: I also have life.

1362
01:36:42,795 --> 01:36:43,956
[SPEAKER_08]: I have gamer ADD.

1363
01:36:44,056 --> 01:36:45,897
[SPEAKER_08]: I have told this on the show many, many times.

1364
01:36:46,018 --> 01:36:49,540
[SPEAKER_08]: I have the worst case of gamer ADD and it's not helping my wallet.

1365
01:36:49,620 --> 01:36:50,981
[SPEAKER_08]: I will buy $60 games.

1366
01:36:51,041 --> 01:36:53,142
[SPEAKER_08]: I swear to God I play them once and then never play them again.

1367
01:36:53,222 --> 01:36:54,683
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a disgusting, filthy habit.

1368
01:36:54,723 --> 01:36:55,384
[SPEAKER_08]: I need to stop.

1369
01:36:55,524 --> 01:36:57,205
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a game right over here that I haven't played yet, Rob.

1370
01:36:57,225 --> 01:36:58,486
[SPEAKER_04]: You should stay and play it with me sometime.

1371
01:36:59,266 --> 01:36:59,687
[SPEAKER_08]: Sometime, yeah.

1372
01:36:59,707 --> 01:37:00,507
[SPEAKER_04]: I have Marvel Ultimate Alliance 2.

1373
01:37:00,547 --> 01:37:01,848
[SPEAKER_08]: You still haven't played that?

1374
01:37:01,868 --> 01:37:02,869
[SPEAKER_08]: You've had that for like two months.

1375
01:37:03,169 --> 01:37:04,590
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1376
01:37:27,792 --> 01:37:37,295
[SPEAKER_04]: To be honest, I've taken a liking to independent games like Bit.Trip Beat and World of Goo because I can usually beat the games within a few weeks.

1377
01:37:37,736 --> 01:37:41,097
[SPEAKER_04]: Which makes me wonder if I'm no different from when I first started playing games like Mario Bros.

1378
01:37:41,137 --> 01:37:41,657
[SPEAKER_04]: or Duck Hunt.

1379
01:37:41,997 --> 01:37:43,538
[SPEAKER_04]: So this brings me back to my original question.

1380
01:37:43,638 --> 01:37:44,298
[SPEAKER_04]: Am I crazy?

1381
01:37:44,338 --> 01:37:45,238
[SPEAKER_04]: Am I thinking too much?

1382
01:37:45,298 --> 01:37:46,459
[SPEAKER_04]: Help me out, Gray Fox.

1383
01:37:46,479 --> 01:37:49,340
[SPEAKER_04]: Dude, just play whatever's fun.

1384
01:37:49,400 --> 01:37:50,480
[SPEAKER_04]: If it's not fun, don't play it.

1385
01:37:51,000 --> 01:37:52,621
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't force yourself into a mold you don't fit in.

1386
01:37:52,941 --> 01:37:54,642
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think tastes change with time.

1387
01:37:54,983 --> 01:37:57,404
[SPEAKER_08]: And maybe it does have something to do with age.

1388
01:37:57,484 --> 01:37:59,786
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know, because I had much more patience when I was little.

1389
01:38:00,287 --> 01:38:05,290
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I play some of those 8-bit games now, and I don't have the patience to collect everything like I used to when I was a kid.

1390
01:38:05,310 --> 01:38:10,935
[SPEAKER_06]: And there's also a lot of peer pressure out there to be playing certain games, like the popular ones, like you'd be in the crowd.

1391
01:38:11,035 --> 01:38:12,356
[SPEAKER_06]: Like Smoking Crack, the game.

1392
01:38:12,396 --> 01:38:16,999
[SPEAKER_08]: Yet, yet, I spend hours upon hours upon hours on World of Warcrack.

1393
01:38:17,420 --> 01:38:17,940
[SPEAKER_08]: Go figure.

1394
01:38:18,440 --> 01:38:20,181
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, some of those are just good, though.

1395
01:38:20,521 --> 01:38:32,126
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think part of it with an MMO is that because it is something that you can just pick up, play for a little bit, and put away, it has that casual aspect on it unless you're, like, I guess one of those freaks that goes raiding.

1396
01:38:35,367 --> 01:38:35,907
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey.

1397
01:38:35,927 --> 01:38:36,808
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't go like I used to.

1398
01:38:36,888 --> 01:38:38,768
[SPEAKER_08]: Raiding kind of ruined WoW for a little while for me.

1399
01:38:39,049 --> 01:38:41,850
[SPEAKER_04]: But keep in mind, for that, that's also a social aspect.

1400
01:38:42,290 --> 01:38:42,590
[SPEAKER_04]: It is.

1401
01:38:42,750 --> 01:38:42,950
[SPEAKER_04]: It is.

1402
01:38:42,990 --> 01:38:43,470
[SPEAKER_04]: It really is.

1403
01:38:43,610 --> 01:38:47,232
[SPEAKER_04]: For me, when I play, I play with, like...

1404
01:38:49,133 --> 01:38:56,857
[SPEAKER_08]: I've described World of Warcraft to friends that I have that don't get the Warcraft obsession or just are curious about it.

1405
01:38:57,217 --> 01:39:01,599
[SPEAKER_08]: I will say it's like a chat room with fireballs is World of Warcraft for me.

1406
01:39:03,345 --> 01:39:08,148
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's kind of neat because friends I have who might live across the country, it gives us a chance.

1407
01:39:08,208 --> 01:39:09,929
[SPEAKER_08]: I know this is going to sound so dorky and nerdy.

1408
01:39:10,190 --> 01:39:10,430
[SPEAKER_03]: I know.

1409
01:39:10,510 --> 01:39:11,110
[SPEAKER_03]: I agree with that.

1410
01:39:11,230 --> 01:39:16,674
[SPEAKER_08]: It gives us a chance to hang out and do something, even though, yes, I understand it's not real life.

1411
01:39:16,714 --> 01:39:20,176
[SPEAKER_08]: But keep in mind, I'm talking about friends that live states and states and thousands of miles away.

1412
01:39:20,476 --> 01:39:24,719
[SPEAKER_08]: We get to kind of do something together, even if it's not, you know, going outside.

1413
01:39:25,300 --> 01:39:26,080
[SPEAKER_08]: So take that as you will.

1414
01:39:26,100 --> 01:39:27,001
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I completely agree with that.

1415
01:39:27,021 --> 01:39:29,522
[SPEAKER_04]: I have the same logic about it, actually.

1416
01:39:30,143 --> 01:39:33,145
[SPEAKER_04]: So we've got one more email from Jim Sally.

1417
01:39:34,026 --> 01:39:34,446
[SPEAKER_04]: DeadPixelLive.com

1418
01:39:54,831 --> 01:40:02,794
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, that last week was, uh, we got a lot of compliments on last week's show, which is weird because I didn't think we did anything special, but talk about more porn than usual.

1419
01:40:02,874 --> 01:40:04,154
[SPEAKER_08]: So I guess the chatters like porn.

1420
01:40:04,174 --> 01:40:04,454
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

1421
01:40:05,094 --> 01:40:10,256
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, as far as I remember what we did, um, I don't know the latest update from last week.

1422
01:40:10,436 --> 01:40:15,718
[SPEAKER_08]: My thought is they are, they had a epilogue, but they're still on the schedule.

1423
01:40:15,798 --> 01:40:17,858
[SPEAKER_08]: So they might, they're still doing something.

1424
01:40:18,238 --> 01:40:19,639
[SPEAKER_08]: So keep an eye on all games.com.

1425
01:40:19,659 --> 01:40:23,480
[SPEAKER_08]: I think they have their own website at dead pixel live.com.

1426
01:40:23,940 --> 01:40:26,081
[SPEAKER_08]: and you can check out what's going on there.

1427
01:40:26,201 --> 01:40:33,343
[SPEAKER_08]: I have not heard that they have left the network or anything like that so I don't know if they're just going through some changes over there or what's going on.

1428
01:40:34,103 --> 01:40:36,764
[SPEAKER_08]: But usually when shows change and stuff I'm like the last to hear about it.

1429
01:40:37,204 --> 01:40:40,285
[SPEAKER_08]: On Sunday night people are kind of self-sufficient I suppose.

1430
01:40:40,305 --> 01:40:42,786
[SPEAKER_08]: They don't keep us in the loop on what's going on the rest of the week.

1431
01:40:42,846 --> 01:40:43,166
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

1432
01:40:43,606 --> 01:40:45,887
[SPEAKER_03]: I still have glue on my fingers.

1433
01:40:48,348 --> 01:40:48,768
[SPEAKER_08]: F.U.s of the week

1434
01:41:27,669 --> 01:41:29,830
[SPEAKER_04]: F you to the situation with my mother.

1435
01:41:30,491 --> 01:41:33,412
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all I'm going to say.

1436
01:41:33,552 --> 01:41:35,393
[SPEAKER_04]: Not to my mother, just with the situation.

1437
01:41:41,016 --> 01:41:42,277
[SPEAKER_06]: F you to having a cold.

1438
01:41:45,999 --> 01:41:48,500
[SPEAKER_06]: Rob, I'm just going to take this moment to say, there's a...

1439
01:41:48,936 --> 01:41:51,919
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a couple arcade cabinets in Rancho Cordova for $25 each.

1440
01:41:52,439 --> 01:41:54,641
[SPEAKER_06]: Missing a monitor, but they'll sell you a monitor for $50.

1441
01:41:55,002 --> 01:41:58,906
[SPEAKER_06]: You can get a Street Fighter 2 cabinet working for $75.

1442
01:42:00,247 --> 01:42:01,148
[SPEAKER_07]: God, that's tempting.

1443
01:42:02,349 --> 01:42:02,609
[SPEAKER_07]: Arrgh!

1444
01:42:03,948 --> 01:42:06,169
[SPEAKER_06]: And they're in ranches, so maybe they'll deliver to you, huh?

1445
01:42:06,189 --> 01:42:06,929
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe, I don't know.

1446
01:42:07,969 --> 01:42:08,130
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry.

1447
01:42:09,010 --> 01:42:10,510
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, I don't really have a lot of FUs of the week.

1448
01:42:10,550 --> 01:42:14,032
[SPEAKER_08]: I actually had, like, a really good week, all things considered.

1449
01:42:14,152 --> 01:42:20,774
[SPEAKER_08]: So, um, I don't really have a lot of angsty stuff, except maybe FU to being exhausted after work on Friday.

1450
01:42:20,834 --> 01:42:22,094
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, I just wanted to go home and die.

1451
01:42:22,154 --> 01:42:23,135
[SPEAKER_08]: And I did, I slept for an hour.

1452
01:42:23,515 --> 01:42:24,135
[SPEAKER_08]: So, there you go.

1453
01:42:25,316 --> 01:42:28,677
[SPEAKER_08]: And FU to the rain causing people to drive like crazy.

1454
01:42:28,717 --> 01:42:30,998
[SPEAKER_08]: It took twice as long to get here as it usually does.

1455
01:42:31,918 --> 01:42:32,158
[SPEAKER_08]: Rawr.

1456
01:42:33,373 --> 01:42:34,774
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, that's going to do it for the FU's of the week.

1457
01:42:35,515 --> 01:42:36,836
[SPEAKER_08]: No story to inspire it tonight.

1458
01:42:37,236 --> 01:42:39,178
[SPEAKER_08]: Everybody's been fairly well behaved out in the world.

1459
01:42:39,478 --> 01:42:43,741
[SPEAKER_08]: Just a couple more stories and then we'll get to your calls at 1-877-GAME-OLR.

1460
01:42:44,322 --> 01:42:47,044
[SPEAKER_08]: But first, some more stories, Loki.

1461
01:42:47,244 --> 01:42:53,389
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, they had an interesting, or there's going to be an interesting update coming to Team Fortress 2.

1462
01:42:54,070 --> 01:42:59,274
[SPEAKER_06]: But what's more interesting than the update itself is how they're deciding who will get the update.

1463
01:42:59,734 --> 01:43:01,215
[SPEAKER_06]: And I guess during the week, you will be able to...

1464
01:43:23,737 --> 01:43:27,279
[SPEAKER_06]: Get the update for the Soldier by becoming the Soldier and killing the Demoman.

1465
01:43:28,079 --> 01:43:32,421
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you want the Demoman to get the update, you need to go kill the Soldier as the Demoman.

1466
01:43:33,301 --> 01:43:34,842
[SPEAKER_06]: So, that's kind of neat.

1467
01:43:36,303 --> 01:43:39,964
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's apparently the, of course, the update's called The War.

1468
01:43:42,746 --> 01:43:43,366
[SPEAKER_06]: That's kind of cool.

1469
01:43:43,726 --> 01:43:50,629
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, Team Fortress 2 is one of those games that they've done a very good job supporting for quite some time since its release.

1470
01:43:51,109 --> 01:43:51,950
[SPEAKER_08]: So, there you go.

1471
01:43:54,112 --> 01:43:59,397
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, it says the update will award three new weapons to both the Soldier and Demoman classes.

1472
01:43:59,897 --> 01:44:03,660
[SPEAKER_06]: Weapons will be revealed piecemeal over the course of next week.

1473
01:44:03,780 --> 01:44:08,705
[SPEAKER_06]: However, two classes will be fighting during the week to unlock a secret fourth weapon for their profession.

1474
01:44:11,226 --> 01:44:12,787
[SPEAKER_08]: Mad Moxie's Underdome Riot Mad Max

1475
01:44:41,742 --> 01:44:48,004
[SPEAKER_08]: What the game will do there is it's actually adding some new Riot Mode arenas for single player and co-op.

1476
01:44:48,044 --> 01:44:56,886
[SPEAKER_08]: There's going to be a bank where you can store your weapons and the whole thing's going to cost you 800 Microsoft points or that would be 10 real dollars and that's how much they're charging on the PS3.

1477
01:44:57,946 --> 01:45:00,907
[SPEAKER_08]: They're saying also it's an entirely new game mode.

1478
01:45:01,427 --> 01:45:07,049
[SPEAKER_08]: They're comparing it to Smash TV in co-op first person shooter in the Borderlands.

1479
01:45:07,129 --> 01:45:08,089
[SPEAKER_08]: That does sound kind of awesome.

1480
01:45:08,869 --> 01:45:10,190
[SPEAKER_08]: So there you go.

1481
01:45:10,570 --> 01:45:14,273
[SPEAKER_08]: SalaciousPop in our chatroom at chat.orangehauntsradio.com calls it a first-person looter.

1482
01:45:15,134 --> 01:45:15,654
[SPEAKER_07]: So there you go.

1483
01:45:17,776 --> 01:45:24,521
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, so we're going to go ahead and open up the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR where we will take your calls right now if you want to go ahead and give us a call.

1484
01:45:24,862 --> 01:45:27,243
[SPEAKER_08]: By the way, I just want to say I followed up in chat.

1485
01:45:28,206 --> 01:45:54,983
[SPEAKER_08]: to one of the emails because I noticed that Derek from Dead Pixel Live was in the All Games chat while we were getting asked that question on the mailbag and he said that it is coming back at 7.30 on Monday after a brief cancellation so there you go so stay tuned to All Games Radio and check that out and I'm assuming 7.30 is Eastern because I know that show used to come on at like 3.30 Pacific it was kind of early for us over here so I think it's just going to be on at a slightly different time so check that out

1486
01:45:56,092 --> 01:46:01,475
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, and of course, for all the ladies, you can always check allgames.com for the latest goings on at All Games Radio.

1487
01:46:01,535 --> 01:46:02,955
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, we are getting some calls, believe it or not.

1488
01:46:02,995 --> 01:46:04,116
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's go to the phones and take them.

1489
01:46:04,456 --> 01:46:05,476
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1490
01:46:05,496 --> 01:46:05,897
[SPEAKER_08]: Who's this?

1491
01:46:07,237 --> 01:46:08,098
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, guys.

1492
01:46:08,118 --> 01:46:09,338
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Spazinator.

1493
01:46:09,378 --> 01:46:10,059
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi, Spazinator.

1494
01:46:10,079 --> 01:46:10,699
[SPEAKER_08]: What's on your mind, buddy?

1495
01:46:12,425 --> 01:46:22,448
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I just want to comment on the little story that you guys said a little while ago about firmware update 3.15 for PS3.

1496
01:46:22,688 --> 01:46:24,949
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, the latest update on PlayStation 3.

1497
01:46:25,009 --> 01:46:25,829
[SPEAKER_08]: Have you checked it out?

1498
01:46:25,849 --> 01:46:26,289
[SPEAKER_08]: You used it?

1499
01:46:26,309 --> 01:46:26,649
[SPEAKER_08]: What's up?

1500
01:46:29,050 --> 01:46:33,091
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a slight hitch with the update.

1501
01:46:33,891 --> 01:46:37,713
[SPEAKER_00]: Even though the update on the PlayStation 3 is in place...

1502
01:46:39,585 --> 01:46:47,206
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't exactly take full use of playing the minis on your PlayStation 3 just yet.

1503
01:46:47,366 --> 01:46:52,067
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, we did note earlier when we were covering it that not all the games are playable.

1504
01:46:52,147 --> 01:46:57,528
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, I guess some of the newer ones and a sprinkling of the old ones you can do, but not all of the new ones.

1505
01:46:57,548 --> 01:46:59,929
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, I guess they're going to, like, patch that in later or something, right?

1506
01:47:01,249 --> 01:47:02,369
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah, exactly.

1507
01:47:02,749 --> 01:47:08,210
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, in fact, you know, I talked to you guys, a few other sites made note of this, and

1508
01:47:10,124 --> 01:47:32,994
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess that I don't have all the details in place just yet, so I don't want to give out any bad information, but I'm guessing that they're going to arrange stuff in such a way on the PSN store that will make it easier to figure out.

1509
01:47:33,720 --> 01:47:39,582
[SPEAKER_00]: which ones you can play on your PlayStation 3 as opposed to which ones that still haven't been updated.

1510
01:47:39,682 --> 01:47:42,863
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I'm hoping that they get them all playable before too long.

1511
01:47:43,223 --> 01:47:44,384
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess that's the idea, right?

1512
01:47:45,704 --> 01:47:46,345
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah, really.

1513
01:47:46,545 --> 01:47:51,486
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, the one thing I definitely want to get in the play is Tetris.

1514
01:47:51,526 --> 01:47:55,528
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I know it's available on virtually every console known to man.

1515
01:47:56,246 --> 01:47:59,787
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, Tetris is pretty much a classic game.

1516
01:48:26,318 --> 01:48:28,741
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's imagine that technically it's possible.

1517
01:48:29,202 --> 01:48:30,923
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's just throw the technical aspect out of it.

1518
01:48:30,963 --> 01:48:31,604
[SPEAKER_08]: Technically it's possible.

1519
01:48:31,925 --> 01:48:32,846
[SPEAKER_08]: Should Sony do it?

1520
01:48:34,547 --> 01:48:39,193
[SPEAKER_00]: From a consumer standpoint, I'd say hell yeah.

1521
01:48:39,233 --> 01:48:42,416
[SPEAKER_00]: However, from a strictly business standpoint...

1522
01:48:48,933 --> 01:48:59,522
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think it would make sense, because I would imagine from Sony's standpoint they would probably lose money, so it's all a matter of how you want to look at it.

1523
01:49:00,142 --> 01:49:14,774
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm all for playing your games, the PSD games on the PS3, but unless things really come to a push, come to a shove, I really don't see it happening, though.

1524
01:49:15,514 --> 01:49:17,275
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't see it happening either, but it's too bad.

1525
01:49:17,315 --> 01:49:24,560
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I can also see the business standpoint of the fact that where it might not then motivate the sale of systems, what it will motivate the sale of is the games.

1526
01:49:24,740 --> 01:49:28,223
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, you know, and all the games that are available right there on the store for digital download.

1527
01:49:28,503 --> 01:49:31,785
[SPEAKER_08]: There's some stuff I would freaking love to play on the PS3.

1528
01:49:32,125 --> 01:49:35,187
[SPEAKER_08]: Like the Final Fantasy remakes, even though I don't think those are in the store yet.

1529
01:49:35,227 --> 01:49:37,849
[SPEAKER_08]: But maybe like the Castlevania game that came out by Konami.

1530
01:49:38,129 --> 01:49:40,711
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, there's a lot of games I would love to play on the TV.

1531
01:49:41,051 --> 01:49:44,213
[SPEAKER_08]: Although, I know, I could use a video out cable if I want to do that.

1532
01:49:45,254 --> 01:49:47,996
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe I want the convenience of not having to do all that.

1533
01:49:49,337 --> 01:50:06,952
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, on a somewhat related note, you know, one thing that I think virtually every time you can hear a replacement of Damage would like to see is, you know, somehow they really bring back PlayStation 2 backwards compatibility.

1534
01:50:07,172 --> 01:50:14,138
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I know the early models, you know, PlayStation 3 had it, and they kind of weeded it out.

1535
01:50:15,330 --> 01:50:27,610
[SPEAKER_00]: and, you know, they're trying to tinker with the look and with the God of War collection and Call of Duty Classic, but, you know, I would love to be able to

1536
01:50:28,206 --> 01:50:31,088
[SPEAKER_00]: Play all my old PlayStation 2 games all over again.

1537
01:50:58,486 --> 01:51:00,608
[SPEAKER_08]: Nothing to think of, but thanks for taking my call, Will.

1538
01:51:15,508 --> 01:51:16,268
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for watching!

1539
01:51:38,717 --> 01:51:39,478
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll just have to create Loki.

1540
01:51:39,498 --> 01:51:41,079
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'll kick anybody who doesn't show up.

1541
01:51:41,239 --> 01:51:42,700
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll just have to create Loki's porn hut.

1542
01:51:43,200 --> 01:51:43,440
[SPEAKER_08]: You do.

1543
01:51:43,500 --> 01:51:44,541
[SPEAKER_08]: You need to make Loki's porn hut.

1544
01:51:44,841 --> 01:51:45,842
[SPEAKER_08]: But for now, we've got another call.

1545
01:51:45,882 --> 01:51:46,803
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1546
01:51:46,823 --> 01:51:47,143
[SPEAKER_08]: Who's this?

1547
01:51:47,803 --> 01:51:48,784
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, hey, it's Ranma.

1548
01:51:48,864 --> 01:51:49,585
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, hey, what's up?

1549
01:51:50,305 --> 01:51:51,086
[SPEAKER_05]: Not too much.

1550
01:51:51,506 --> 01:51:52,346
[SPEAKER_05]: A couple of things.

1551
01:51:52,386 --> 01:51:53,507
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll be on my merry little way.

1552
01:51:53,687 --> 01:51:57,210
[SPEAKER_05]: Number one, I just had my 360 replaced yet again.

1553
01:51:57,810 --> 01:51:58,231
[SPEAKER_05]: Again?

1554
01:51:58,271 --> 01:51:58,731
[SPEAKER_05]: What happened?

1555
01:52:00,047 --> 01:52:09,192
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, I got the dreaded disk read error, and because Best Buy screwed up the first time around when exchanging my console, I got it replaced yet again.

1556
01:52:09,872 --> 01:52:16,376
[SPEAKER_08]: I seem to remember something like this coming up a couple weeks ago about the whole Best Buy shenanigans, so they didn't put up too much of a fight in replacing it for you?

1557
01:52:18,171 --> 01:52:18,451
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow.

1558
01:52:43,895 --> 01:53:11,054
[SPEAKER_05]: so the guy says he had some Geek Squad blow it out with compressed air which is something I already did he says take it home if it works it works if not bring it back and exchange it so I now have an Elite sitting on my counter how does blowing out a console fix a DVD drive well it works on Nintendo I don't know you tell me wow alright well I guess there you go they finally got you one though right

1559
01:53:11,653 --> 01:53:14,375
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I had to swap out the hard drive.

1560
01:53:14,436 --> 01:53:20,581
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sitting there like, well, I could take the 120 gig hard drive, come home with it, and my roommate would kill me because of all the saves.

1561
01:53:20,701 --> 01:53:23,083
[SPEAKER_05]: Or I could just take the 60 gig, which I did.

1562
01:53:25,145 --> 01:53:26,626
[SPEAKER_08]: What else is going on in your gaming world, Ranma?

1563
01:53:27,807 --> 01:53:28,268
[SPEAKER_05]: Not too much.

1564
01:53:28,308 --> 01:53:34,553
[SPEAKER_05]: I started back into playing Legend of Zelda Phantom Hourglass because I forgot where I left off at, so I'm starting from scratch.

1565
01:53:35,995 --> 01:53:37,296
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, sometimes that's what you got to do.

1566
01:53:37,316 --> 01:53:38,317
[SPEAKER_08]: You got to start all over.

1567
01:53:39,302 --> 01:53:40,042
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't just hate that.

1568
01:53:40,082 --> 01:53:43,303
[SPEAKER_05]: You pick up an RPG after you haven't played it for a long time.

1569
01:53:43,323 --> 01:53:45,024
[SPEAKER_05]: You're like, where the hell was I?

1570
01:53:45,344 --> 01:53:46,764
[SPEAKER_08]: Damn it, I have to start all over.

1571
01:53:46,924 --> 01:53:48,405
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I did that with Lost Odyssey.

1572
01:53:49,245 --> 01:53:53,186
[SPEAKER_08]: I was on the second disc or something, and then I went back and played it again.

1573
01:53:53,226 --> 01:53:56,587
[SPEAKER_08]: I got all the way to the third disc, and now it's been a few months since I played.

1574
01:53:56,627 --> 01:53:58,748
[SPEAKER_08]: If I wanted to go back, I'd probably have to start from the beginning again.

1575
01:53:59,088 --> 01:54:08,711
[SPEAKER_08]: I will say, though, what little I've played of Dragon Age Origins, I do like, though, that whenever on the loading screen of Dragon Age Origins, it gives you a one-paragraph summary of where you are in the story.

1576
01:54:09,871 --> 01:54:12,792
[SPEAKER_08]: I thought that was a really smart feature, kind of remind you what's going on.

1577
01:54:13,013 --> 01:54:13,773
[SPEAKER_08]: I thought that was pretty cool.

1578
01:54:15,934 --> 01:54:18,715
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, Ranma, if there's nothing else on your mind, then I'll let you go so we can get some more calls.

1579
01:54:18,735 --> 01:54:19,955
[SPEAKER_08]: But thanks so much for your call, okay, buddy?

1580
01:54:20,555 --> 01:54:21,856
[SPEAKER_05]: I have one thing, and I'll be on my way.

1581
01:54:22,076 --> 01:54:23,757
[SPEAKER_05]: I talked about Avatar earlier.

1582
01:54:23,997 --> 01:54:32,840
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to let everyone know that a friend of mine, Kyle Hebert, who's a voice actor, he's doing the playable character, Ryuk, for Avatar the Game for the Wii.

1583
01:54:33,833 --> 01:54:43,959
[SPEAKER_08]: maybe we'll have to get him on the show I know there's another voice actor we're trying to get on the show hopefully in the next couple weeks I will let him know and let's see what happens with it awesome take care buddy

1584
01:54:46,471 --> 01:54:50,796
[SPEAKER_08]: 877-GAME-OLR if you want to get through or our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

1585
01:54:50,836 --> 01:54:52,799
[SPEAKER_08]: Again, that's 1-877-GAME-OLR.

1586
01:54:53,199 --> 01:54:54,100
[SPEAKER_08]: Toll-free in the U.S.

1587
01:54:54,160 --> 01:55:03,952
[SPEAKER_08]: and Canada, but if you're in another country besides those two, I would really urge you to use Skype because it's free, whereas you get charged for using toll-free numbers in non-North America countries.

1588
01:55:05,353 --> 01:55:06,834
[SPEAKER_08]: Do we have any last minute stories tonight, Loki?

1589
01:55:06,874 --> 01:55:11,699
[SPEAKER_06]: Real quick, a few things on the Xbox 360 hacking scene.

1590
01:55:12,059 --> 01:55:20,246
[SPEAKER_06]: The two newer light-on drives that were unhackable before are now able to be dumped through a new method that they've figured out.

1591
01:55:20,847 --> 01:55:22,529
[SPEAKER_06]: And also they found out a way to...

1592
01:55:23,601 --> 01:55:30,563
[SPEAKER_06]: Hack, Xbox Live Arcade Games, and now they can register any game that they have a demo for.

1593
01:55:30,883 --> 01:55:32,043
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks to Yaris!

1594
01:55:32,783 --> 01:55:33,863
[SPEAKER_06]: Yaris made it possible.

1595
01:55:34,263 --> 01:55:36,064
[SPEAKER_06]: So there was some good for that game after all.

1596
01:55:36,184 --> 01:55:36,744
[SPEAKER_08]: Interesting.

1597
01:55:37,564 --> 01:55:39,485
[SPEAKER_08]: So Yaris had some good come out of it after all.

1598
01:55:39,505 --> 01:55:48,547
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course, it does require that you have a modded homebrew-enabled system, which requires a certain mod chip and a firmware prior to...

1599
01:55:49,707 --> 01:55:51,609
[SPEAKER_06]: Beat Raiders coming to the iPhone, that's kind of neat, I guess.

1600
01:56:09,540 --> 01:56:10,961
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, that's the Timbaland game, right?

1601
01:56:11,161 --> 01:56:11,501
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1602
01:56:12,842 --> 01:56:16,443
[SPEAKER_08]: Did you hear he collaborated with Miley Cyrus on the new album?

1603
01:56:17,003 --> 01:56:18,344
[SPEAKER_08]: That's an odd pairing, isn't it?

1604
01:56:18,624 --> 01:56:20,145
[SPEAKER_08]: Timbaland and Miley Cyrus?

1605
01:56:20,465 --> 01:56:20,905
[SPEAKER_08]: For real?

1606
01:56:21,305 --> 01:56:23,506
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, she's trying to become more edgy, I guess.

1607
01:56:23,526 --> 01:56:26,988
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know if I can believe that, but all right.

1608
01:56:30,286 --> 01:56:30,887
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that it?

1609
01:56:31,007 --> 01:56:31,527
[SPEAKER_08]: That's all you got?

1610
01:56:31,707 --> 01:56:33,148
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that's all I got.

1611
01:56:33,168 --> 01:56:36,070
[SPEAKER_08]: When all is said and done, it wasn't a super busy news week.

1612
01:56:36,911 --> 01:56:42,015
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, I'm going to ask you if you have anything last minute, but usually you speak up if you do.

1613
01:56:44,193 --> 01:56:45,234
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not feeling well, Rob.

1614
01:56:45,294 --> 01:56:45,754
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sorry.

1615
01:56:46,495 --> 01:56:47,055
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry to hear that.

1616
01:56:47,536 --> 01:56:48,196
[SPEAKER_08]: I hope you feel better.

1617
01:56:48,436 --> 01:56:49,177
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm feeling lightheaded.

1618
01:56:49,497 --> 01:56:49,838
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, no.

1619
01:56:50,358 --> 01:56:51,719
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, maybe you need to go lie down and take a nap.

1620
01:56:52,380 --> 01:56:52,620
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe.

1621
01:56:52,840 --> 01:56:56,924
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, the good news is, then I suppose for you, is that the show is just about done here.

1622
01:56:56,944 --> 01:57:00,608
[SPEAKER_08]: It doesn't look like we're getting any more calls, which there's a lot of shy chatters tonight.

1623
01:57:00,628 --> 01:57:02,389
[SPEAKER_08]: We got some people going, should I call in?

1624
01:57:02,429 --> 01:57:03,030
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

1625
01:57:03,050 --> 01:57:06,033
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm like, well, call in if you have something to say, but the phone's not going off.

1626
01:57:06,073 --> 01:57:07,034
[SPEAKER_06]: The good news is... What?

1627
01:57:08,058 --> 01:57:11,602
[SPEAKER_06]: I ordered my pasta for you.

1628
01:57:12,283 --> 01:57:13,104
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that for you and the wife?

1629
01:57:13,525 --> 01:57:16,088
[SPEAKER_06]: It's for us and our guests.

1630
01:57:16,128 --> 01:57:18,611
[SPEAKER_06]: We have a friend that just had their baby.

1631
01:57:18,651 --> 01:57:19,152
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll back in.

1632
01:57:19,921 --> 01:57:21,142
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't hate Utada's first US album.

1633
01:57:46,121 --> 01:57:51,007
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think it's like OMG greatest thing ever, but it's not bad as a piece of pop music.

1634
01:57:51,067 --> 01:57:51,527
[SPEAKER_08]: It's fine.

1635
01:57:51,807 --> 01:57:53,970
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it was underrated, I think, by a lot of people.

1636
01:57:54,390 --> 01:57:58,775
[SPEAKER_08]: But yeah, if you're a fan of Timbaland, Utada's first US album, I'm looking forward to seeing her live.

1637
01:57:58,955 --> 01:58:01,018
[SPEAKER_08]: That's going to be a rare opportunity in January.

1638
01:58:01,118 --> 01:58:01,678
[SPEAKER_08]: So woohoo!

1639
01:58:02,880 --> 01:58:04,481
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyhow, we're going to go around and wrap it up.

1640
01:58:04,521 --> 01:58:07,764
[SPEAKER_08]: I know it's a little bit of a short show tonight, but it's been kind of a weird week.

1641
01:58:07,904 --> 01:58:10,767
[SPEAKER_08]: Also, right before Christmas, not a lot going on.

1642
01:58:10,807 --> 01:58:15,511
[SPEAKER_08]: People are just getting ready for the holidays and all that stuff, which actually already started with Hanukkah.

1643
01:58:15,531 --> 01:58:17,073
[SPEAKER_08]: It kind of kicks off the holiday season.

1644
01:58:17,573 --> 01:58:19,214
[SPEAKER_08]: Of course, you have all the other stuff.

1645
01:58:19,234 --> 01:58:20,516
[SPEAKER_08]: It really goes on through New Year's

1646
01:58:20,936 --> 01:58:21,156
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm tired.

1647
01:58:21,176 --> 01:58:21,977
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry to hear that.

1648
01:58:22,017 --> 01:58:22,097
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki.

1649
01:58:41,092 --> 01:58:42,173
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't wait to eat the pasta

1650
01:59:04,713 --> 01:59:05,513
[SPEAKER_08]: That's my final thought.

1651
01:59:05,553 --> 01:59:08,134
[SPEAKER_08]: Hail Godga, because it's the whole reason the show's getting screwed up tonight.

1652
01:59:08,254 --> 01:59:09,295
[SPEAKER_08]: So, appreciate it.

1653
01:59:10,575 --> 01:59:10,995
[SPEAKER_08]: That's it.

1654
01:59:11,396 --> 01:59:13,976
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you guys so much for tuning into and supporting Orange Lounge Radio.

1655
01:59:13,996 --> 01:59:14,877
[SPEAKER_08]: We really appreciate it.

1656
01:59:15,137 --> 01:59:19,799
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, we do the show for free, and all we ask, if you enjoy what you've heard, tell a friend or two about the show.

1657
01:59:20,059 --> 01:59:21,059
[SPEAKER_08]: Help us spread the word.

1658
01:59:21,119 --> 01:59:22,080
[SPEAKER_08]: Word of mouth's all we got.

1659
01:59:22,140 --> 01:59:24,981
[SPEAKER_08]: We don't have a big, big magazine or anything that backs us up.

1660
01:59:25,341 --> 01:59:25,881
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just us.

1661
01:59:25,941 --> 01:59:27,422
[SPEAKER_08]: We do accept donations.

1662
01:59:28,042 --> 01:59:29,622
[SPEAKER_08]: We will be back, though, next year.

1663
01:59:29,682 --> 01:59:31,383
[SPEAKER_08]: Donations of money and food.

1664
01:59:32,583 --> 01:59:33,224
[SPEAKER_08]: Cookies are good.

1665
01:59:33,284 --> 01:59:33,744
[SPEAKER_08]: Macroons.

1666
01:59:34,386 --> 01:59:36,129
[SPEAKER_03]: I just gave Rob the last of my macaroons.

1667
01:59:36,891 --> 01:59:37,812
[SPEAKER_08]: They were delicious, by the way.

1668
01:59:38,293 --> 01:59:39,195
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyhow, that's going to do it.

1669
01:59:39,255 --> 01:59:39,956
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you guys so much.

1670
01:59:40,597 --> 01:59:42,721
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll do it all again next week on the 19th.

1671
01:59:42,941 --> 01:59:47,329
[SPEAKER_08]: So, until then, I'm Rob, she's Jamie, he's Loki, and we're gone!

1672
01:59:48,143 --> 01:59:50,904
[SPEAKER_02]: You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
