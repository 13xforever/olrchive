Orange Lounge Radio

00:07.000 --> 00:12.000
With your hosts, DarkSakura, Sky and Loco

00:14.000 --> 00:19.000
Tonight, December 27th, 2009, Pac-Man might soon fight at Battle Royale.

00:19.000 --> 00:22.000
Could your portable games soon be banned on airplanes?

00:22.000 --> 00:25.000
We take a look back on the year and the decade in gaming.

00:25.000 --> 00:30.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:31.000 --> 00:36.000
Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

00:36.000 --> 00:43.000
We are live with our 350th episode on this lovely Sunday evening, December 27th, 2009.

00:43.000 --> 00:45.000
Yes, we're here for the holidays.

00:45.000 --> 00:49.000
Broadcasting live every Sunday night, www.allgames.com

00:49.000 --> 00:54.000
We're an All Games Radio affiliate and we're very thankful that they let us steal their bandwidth every Sunday night

00:54.000 --> 00:56.000
to do our little program.

00:56.000 --> 01:02.000
Joining you over the next few hours, myself, Rob Roberts, and of course the one and only, Jamie Summers, DarkSakura.

01:02.000 --> 01:04.000
Stupid thread isn't working.

01:04.000 --> 01:07.000
How are you doing? Are you posting on the internet? Is that the type of thread you're talking about?

01:07.000 --> 01:09.000
No, I'm crocheting.

01:09.000 --> 01:10.000
I see.

01:10.000 --> 01:13.000
I'm being domestic, dammit. Who wants a hat?

01:13.000 --> 01:14.000
Wow, that's a change.

01:14.000 --> 01:15.000
Who wants a hat?

01:15.000 --> 01:16.000
Me? No.

01:16.000 --> 01:18.000
You'll get a very tiny hat.

01:18.000 --> 01:21.000
Say hello to... I'll put it on my thumb.

01:21.000 --> 01:23.000
Say hello to Tech Master, Loki.

01:23.000 --> 01:24.000
Hello.

01:24.000 --> 01:25.000
How you doing?

01:25.000 --> 01:26.000
I'm alright.

01:26.000 --> 01:27.000
Except we can't hear you at all. Is your mic on?

01:27.000 --> 01:28.000
Yes, it is.

01:28.000 --> 01:30.000
I don't know why we're not hearing you at all tonight.

01:30.000 --> 01:34.000
That's the wonders of live radio, is that sometimes you get technical difficulties, things happen.

01:34.000 --> 01:36.000
Sometimes people play with my volume, apparently.

01:36.000 --> 01:38.000
Apparently. I don't know what's up with that.

01:38.000 --> 01:43.000
I think what's going on is that behind our backs, DarkSakura's been secretly taping another show.

01:43.000 --> 01:45.000
No! Not at all.

01:45.000 --> 01:47.000
And he's been screwing with some of the audio settings.

01:47.000 --> 01:50.000
I didn't touch Loki's. I mean, I don't know what you're talking about.

01:50.000 --> 01:52.000
Try again, Loki. I think we'll hear you now.

01:52.000 --> 01:53.000
Alright.

01:53.000 --> 01:54.000
Now we hear you too much.

01:54.000 --> 01:55.000
It's really loud.

01:55.000 --> 01:56.000
We're good now.

01:56.000 --> 01:58.000
How are you doing, Loki? How was your week?

01:58.000 --> 01:59.000
I'm alright.

01:59.000 --> 02:00.000
Did you have a good holiday?

02:00.000 --> 02:01.000
Yeah, sure.

02:01.000 --> 02:04.000
Did Santa bring you lots of good stuff for the holidays?

02:04.000 --> 02:08.000
Pots and stuff to do yard work.

02:08.000 --> 02:10.000
Dude, Santa brought you pot?

02:10.000 --> 02:12.000
No, like pots and pans.

02:12.000 --> 02:13.000
Oh, I see.

02:13.000 --> 02:16.000
Just in time for New Year's, Rob.

02:16.000 --> 02:18.000
Amazing.

02:18.000 --> 02:23.000
Alright, let's go around and talk about our gaming week. So we always start off the show talking about what we've been playing this week.

02:23.000 --> 02:25.000
DarkSakura, why don't you start us off?

02:25.000 --> 02:27.000
Wow.

02:27.000 --> 02:28.000
I played some.

02:28.000 --> 02:34.000
And I downloaded Braid because it was really cheap for Insert Holiday Here.

02:34.000 --> 02:40.000
And I also picked up World of Goo, which I started and then stopped.

02:40.000 --> 02:43.000
Because I was like, oh wait, I have to do some stuff.

02:43.000 --> 02:46.000
So I've got some new games that I just haven't played yet.

02:46.000 --> 02:51.000
I also pre-ordered... I hate the word pre-order.

02:51.000 --> 02:56.000
So I just ordered my copy in advance of Star Trek Online.

02:56.000 --> 03:05.000
And apparently if you do the order through Amazon, or through I guess any of the others, you'll get like a thing to do the beta.

03:05.000 --> 03:06.000
Nice.

03:06.000 --> 03:08.000
So I'm going to be in the beta.

03:08.000 --> 03:10.000
When's the beta start? I can't remember. There's so many like...

03:10.000 --> 03:12.000
January something... something teeth.

03:12.000 --> 03:17.000
It's like closed beta and open beta and retweet to get into the OMG Right Now betas.

03:17.000 --> 03:21.000
Like there's so many betas going on. I feel like I'm in the 80s all over again.

03:21.000 --> 03:23.000
And VHS is just around the corner.

03:23.000 --> 03:25.000
It's January something teeth.

03:25.000 --> 03:27.000
I see. Alright, thank you. That's so helpful.

03:27.000 --> 03:32.000
But I also got Dan picked up for me.

03:32.000 --> 03:36.000
Oh, by the way, it has to be the collector's edition.

03:36.000 --> 03:38.000
Oh, for you to get in the beta?

03:38.000 --> 03:39.000
To get in the beta.

03:39.000 --> 03:40.000
I see, okay.

03:40.000 --> 03:41.000
Which is what I got.

03:41.000 --> 03:43.000
Which is what I imagine a lot of people are getting anyway.

03:43.000 --> 03:50.000
And Dan picked up for me the Silent Hill game on Wii, so I need people to come over and hold my hand while I play it.

03:50.000 --> 03:54.000
You know, I watched a friend play that game a couple days ago, and it was very strange.

03:54.000 --> 03:58.000
Like I saw the nightmare sequence happen, you know, and it's weird.

03:58.000 --> 04:01.000
It doesn't get all like rusty. It's just like snowy in that game.

04:01.000 --> 04:07.000
And it was just running through doors over and over, running through doors, running through doors, running through doors, trying to avoid zombies.

04:07.000 --> 04:15.000
I was like, you don't really run. I mean, you do run in Silent Hill, but this felt like an action game or something.

04:15.000 --> 04:18.000
It was strange when I watched. I didn't play it, I watched.

04:18.000 --> 04:21.000
It shatters your memories of Silent Hill. How about that?

04:21.000 --> 04:22.000
Clearly.

04:22.000 --> 04:23.000
Clearly.

04:23.000 --> 04:24.000
You have a bug about to crawl into your hair behind you.

04:24.000 --> 04:25.000
Just saying.

04:25.000 --> 04:28.000
Gross! Gross! Our studio's infested!

04:28.000 --> 04:31.000
It is not infested. Here's a tissue, you big baby.

04:31.000 --> 04:39.000
There's bugs in our studio! Is that what you plan to end the decade with? Killer bugs, destroy the host?

04:39.000 --> 04:42.000
Rob, it probably snuck into the window. Don't kill it, you big baby.

04:42.000 --> 04:46.000
Hold on, I'm going to take a picture of it to show the listeners how big this scary bug is.

04:46.000 --> 04:47.000
Oh, fuck.

04:47.000 --> 04:49.000
Make sure to zoom in.

04:49.000 --> 04:52.000
Anything else for your gaming week, DarkSakura?

04:52.000 --> 04:56.000
I played the game where I laugh about Rob being a big baby.

04:56.000 --> 04:57.000
Shut up, this is a big scary bug.

04:57.000 --> 05:02.000
We also played some Marvel Ultimate Alliance 2, which was really good.

05:02.000 --> 05:07.000
When I upload this to the feed, it's going to look like a big poop on your curtain.

05:07.000 --> 05:10.000
Just kill it already, Rob. Is it a pincher?

05:10.000 --> 05:14.000
I'm going to kill it. I don't know. If it pinches, I'm going to scream.

05:14.000 --> 05:17.000
Here, give me the napkin. Hold my mic.

05:17.000 --> 05:20.000
DarkSakura saves the day.

05:20.000 --> 05:23.000
I should just let it do its thing.

05:23.000 --> 05:24.000
Not even.

05:24.000 --> 05:25.000
Don't.

05:25.000 --> 05:27.000
It's a scary bug.

05:27.000 --> 05:29.000
It's a pincher, it's fine.

05:29.000 --> 05:32.000
But pinchers pinch. That's why they're called pinchers.

05:32.000 --> 05:35.000
They're not called pinchers. They're called earwigs, I thought.

05:35.000 --> 05:39.000
Now that our show has been sufficiently derailed for the decade, Loki, how was your gaming week?

05:39.000 --> 05:45.000
It was alright. I didn't play a whole lot. I played more Grand Theft Auto this week, what level I could.

05:45.000 --> 05:46.000
It went crunch.

05:46.000 --> 05:52.000
And then I brought my 360 home hoping to play more stuff, but I just didn't because I ended up messing around with other things.

05:52.000 --> 05:58.000
So I played a little big planet of the new Pirates of the Caribbean water stuff.

05:58.000 --> 06:05.000
It's neat. Not as exciting as the paint-neater, but how can you top guns? You just can't.

06:05.000 --> 06:11.000
So it's pretty cool, but I'm just not as excited.

06:11.000 --> 06:15.000
And somewhere along the way, I downloaded some level creator pack or something like that.

06:15.000 --> 06:20.000
They had a bunch of other stuff in there. I honestly don't remember doing that, but I guess I did at some point.

06:20.000 --> 06:22.000
So that's kind of neat.

06:22.000 --> 06:28.000
But I was going to play also Modination Racers, and granted I did all this like an hour before the show.

06:28.000 --> 06:33.000
So I meant to play Modination Racers as well, because I'm in the beta for that.

06:33.000 --> 06:39.000
However, since I haven't played a little big planet in forever, I had to download the updates, which took 15 minutes.

06:39.000 --> 06:41.000
Oh geez, yeah, I can imagine.

06:41.000 --> 06:47.000
You know what? Hey, props to them, because that means they have just been putting update after update after update on that game.

06:47.000 --> 06:49.000
Tons of updates.

06:49.000 --> 06:56.000
I think the last time I downloaded the update was update 1.05, and they're up to 1.23 now.

06:56.000 --> 06:58.000
It's a bummer, though. It's not smart enough to just go,

06:58.000 --> 07:06.000
Okay, I'm going to download the patch that takes you from 1.05 all the way up to, without having to download like five patches in between.

07:06.000 --> 07:07.000
Something like that, yeah.

07:07.000 --> 07:10.000
Sometimes PC games do that, especially like MMOs.

07:10.000 --> 07:13.000
So then, like I said, I played the levels a little bit.

07:13.000 --> 07:19.000
It's kind of neat. The water stuffs are, I mean, you can raise and lower the water. You have air that you can breathe in there.

07:19.000 --> 07:26.000
You can suck up the bubbles much like you would in one of the other games out there that has the water stuff.

07:26.000 --> 07:27.000
Sonic.

07:27.000 --> 07:29.000
Sonic, yes. Perfect example.

07:29.000 --> 07:32.000
And the Pirates of the Caribbean stuff is kind of neat.

07:32.000 --> 07:37.000
The characters, obviously, they don't really have anything that looks too much like the stuff in the movie,

07:37.000 --> 07:45.000
but the same typical plot. They have the two royal guards or whatever, the imperial guards or whoever they are,

07:45.000 --> 07:48.000
from the movie are in there and that kind of thing.

07:48.000 --> 07:53.000
I only got to play the first level, though, before I wanted to move on to other things.

07:53.000 --> 07:57.000
Then I actually played a little bit on the arcade cabinet.

07:57.000 --> 08:07.000
I had a friend over and we were testing out my newly souped up joysticks because I added octagonal restrictors in them now,

08:07.000 --> 08:11.000
and also tighter springs.

08:11.000 --> 08:17.000
So I did everything except take apart the actual pushbuttons to put a little paper in there and stuff.

08:17.000 --> 08:22.000
Honestly, I just don't want to mess with that because I have a feeling it's going to fall apart after a while.

08:22.000 --> 08:23.000
It's enough.

08:23.000 --> 08:28.000
So I played Marvel vs. Capcom 1 and I'm not very good at it.

08:28.000 --> 08:33.000
I like Marvel vs. Capcom 2, but I couldn't figure out why I didn't have it yet,

08:33.000 --> 08:36.000
and it's because I don't have any Niomi games yet.

08:36.000 --> 08:41.000
So that's why I basically spent most of the holiday doing was downloading Niomi games

08:41.000 --> 08:51.000
and downloading Sega Model A games and zinc emulation games and all sorts of crap.

08:51.000 --> 08:59.000
Oh, and CPS3 stuff, so I have Street Fighter 3 and JoJo's Bizarre Adventure and all that fun stuff.

08:59.000 --> 09:07.000
So anyways, the actual game I did play, we played all the way through Simpsons the arcade game on MAME, so that was fun.

09:07.000 --> 09:09.000
I love playing through there.

09:09.000 --> 09:14.000
Nice. You know there's a Simpsons arcade on iPhone now, but it's not even the same thing.

09:14.000 --> 09:20.000
It's just the same name, and I think it's definitely inspired by the old arcade game, but it's not the old arcade game.

09:20.000 --> 09:24.000
And I think that's because this new one is EA, whereas the old one was Konami, right?

09:24.000 --> 09:26.000
Because it was the same engine as Turtles.

09:26.000 --> 09:33.000
So obviously they probably couldn't borrow the same code, but they did a game that feels very like it.

09:33.000 --> 09:36.000
But instead of trying to save Maggie, I think it's Homer going after Donuts.

09:36.000 --> 09:38.000
I don't know, I haven't played it. I've only read about it.

09:38.000 --> 09:43.000
But I find it interesting that they are trying to cash in on that nostalgia a little bit in the very crowded iPhone market.

09:43.000 --> 09:45.000
It was fun. I love playing the game.

09:45.000 --> 09:51.000
I mean, we had a lot of fun playing it, so that was cool, and I'm trying to think of other stuff.

09:51.000 --> 09:56.000
We were just trying a bunch of random games on there, but I still...

09:56.000 --> 09:58.000
Ms. World Nude 96, my favorite MAME game ever.

09:58.000 --> 10:03.000
Didn't play that, but the problem is, see right now, I'm going through my list of games I have on there.

10:03.000 --> 10:07.000
Because there's a ton of games, first off, clones that I have on there that I need to get rid of.

10:07.000 --> 10:13.000
And I got rid of them on one list, but I need to get rid of them on the list that's for my front end so that they don't display on there.

10:13.000 --> 10:18.000
And then also, I have a whole bunch of Mahjong games and crap I'm not going to play.

10:18.000 --> 10:23.000
So I have to go through and delete all that stuff or stuff that just doesn't work.

10:23.000 --> 10:31.000
You know, delete the Simpsons Arcade 4 player version, because I only have a 2 player cabinet, so that's just completely useless.

10:31.000 --> 10:36.000
So all that stuff. So I have to go through there and do that, because right now I'm trying to find something that's just...

10:36.000 --> 10:43.000
Luckily I can skip via letter, but even still, it's just you're holding it down, scrolling through lists of stuff just to try to find anything.

10:43.000 --> 10:46.000
You sound like me trying to organize my iTunes library.

10:46.000 --> 10:52.000
A friend of mine inspired me to organize my iTunes a little better, and I've been trying to do that.

10:52.000 --> 11:00.000
And it is a mess. Like, I have all these misspelled artists and albums and trying to get the right album art and things from compilations.

11:00.000 --> 11:05.000
It's a pain in the ass. It sounds very similar, just what you're describing is going through that whole process.

11:05.000 --> 11:10.000
Yeah. So it'll be nice when it's done, especially I'm really excited to try some of these new Niomi games.

11:10.000 --> 11:17.000
Because a lot of them don't necessarily work, and you have one emulator for Niomi disc based games and Dreamcast games,

11:17.000 --> 11:22.000
and you have another emulator for Niomi cartridge games, and some of those work and some of them don't.

11:22.000 --> 11:33.000
So some of the ones that will work though, like Ikaruga, Marvel Vs. Capcom 2, there's some I haven't even heard of before.

11:33.000 --> 11:36.000
Like a lot of these really crazy shooter games.

11:36.000 --> 11:49.000
Then just some of the normal ones like Senkei no Rondo in Radio Allergy or Ratagy or whatever.

11:49.000 --> 11:53.000
A lot of the cave shooters and stuff like that.

11:53.000 --> 11:55.000
So that'll be kind of cool to put in there.

11:55.000 --> 12:05.000
Especially now that I have the heavy springs on, the joysticks for really twitchy movements and stuff that'll really come in handy for shooters and stuff.

12:05.000 --> 12:09.000
So yeah, lots of downloading stuff for the cabinet.

12:09.000 --> 12:12.000
That's mainly what I've been doing during the break.

12:12.000 --> 12:18.000
I still haven't played Borderlands. I was like, I'm gonna play Borderlands this break! I'm gonna do it!

12:18.000 --> 12:20.000
I haven't done it yet.

12:20.000 --> 12:26.000
And I even brought home Bayonetta. I was like, oh, I'm gonna play Bayonetta.

12:26.000 --> 12:35.000
What was it? Otomedius Gorgeous, the Konami shooter that has chicks flying around. I was gonna play that.

12:35.000 --> 12:37.000
Just didn't get around to it.

12:37.000 --> 12:40.000
There's just too many games. You have too many games to play.

12:40.000 --> 12:45.000
People sometimes forget. We do this podcasting thing as a hobby. We don't get paid to do it.

12:45.000 --> 12:49.000
We're just gamers that do it for fun, just like many of you who listen to this show.

12:49.000 --> 12:53.000
The folks that review these professionally, that do have the time to play every single game that comes out,

12:53.000 --> 12:59.000
usually teams of several people, that's their jobs. That's what they do for eight hours a day is play video games.

12:59.000 --> 13:05.000
Wish I could do that. But then again, keep in mind, those reviewers, they have to play eight hours of the bad games as well as the good games.

13:05.000 --> 13:13.000
Well, one of my friends actually did some testing for a while. I was so sick of playing soccer.

13:13.000 --> 13:18.000
Testing or reviewing. I mean, sometimes, you know, that's a discussion for a whole other show.

13:18.000 --> 13:20.000
I wasn't even trying to get into strategy guides.

13:20.000 --> 13:22.000
I remember that, yeah.

13:22.000 --> 13:30.000
And they'll have you review. They'll just play through some of the most games. I still want to do that, though.

13:30.000 --> 13:34.000
You should. It'd be fun. Anyhow, sorry, Loki. Anything else you want to say about your gaming week?

13:34.000 --> 13:45.000
That's basically it. It's just lots of downloading stuff, and I'm sure none of that's legal because, you know, they're ROMs and whatever.

13:45.000 --> 13:52.000
But you know what? I'm not going to go buy multi-thousand dollars worth of arcade boards.

13:52.000 --> 13:55.000
Going to our chat room, the always present fourth guest on the show.

13:55.000 --> 14:00.000
And if you are listening live to us on All Games Radio on this lovely Sunday evening, head on over to our chat room.

14:00.000 --> 14:03.000
Chat.orangeloungeloungeradio.com is the easiest way to get there.

14:03.000 --> 14:09.000
Or if you know your IRC, you just want to join the Game Surge Network on IRC gamesurge.net.

14:09.000 --> 14:14.000
And we are in channel pound orange lounge is the name of our chat room.

14:14.000 --> 14:23.000
Anyhow, reading some comments from chat, it went all the way back up here, talking about, I think Tiger Claw had said that it's appropriate.

14:23.000 --> 14:27.000
Oh yes, what a way to start the last show of the new year or decade with a bug.

14:27.000 --> 14:34.000
Going back to the bug. Because you know how sometimes, like, music will sometimes play when it's not supposed to here on the show.

14:34.000 --> 14:37.000
Whoops, live radio! Shit.

14:37.000 --> 14:40.000
It's the joys of live radio.

14:40.000 --> 14:47.000
Also reading some comments from chat, Ray Iyanami in our chat room says, PS, get your asses to SVGL, Sunnyvale Golf Land.

14:47.000 --> 14:49.000
There is a Simpsons machine here.

14:49.000 --> 14:53.000
You know what's interesting? There is Simpsons machines kind of still out there all over.

14:53.000 --> 14:57.000
I saw one randomly. I was at this hotel near Disneyland staying.

14:57.000 --> 14:59.000
They had a game room in the hotel.

14:59.000 --> 15:04.000
I haven't seen a game room in a hotel that wasn't a casino, like, since I was a teenager.

15:04.000 --> 15:06.000
It's been a very long time.

15:06.000 --> 15:14.000
One of the first times we went to Disneyland, there was a hotel that we stayed in that had a game room and I'd go down there.

15:14.000 --> 15:16.000
I wonder if it was the same hotel.

15:16.000 --> 15:18.000
Maybe, who knows. Was it near the convention center?

15:18.000 --> 15:20.000
Well, the convention center wasn't built.

15:20.000 --> 15:22.000
Oh yeah, that's right.

15:22.000 --> 15:29.000
Anyhow, but the Simpsons arcade game, obviously a lot of people really remember this and it's still in arcades and probably still frickin' makes money.

15:29.000 --> 15:34.000
But, you know, this machine at this particular hotel, their game room was in pretty sad shape.

15:34.000 --> 15:36.000
Like, half the machines weren't working.

15:36.000 --> 15:42.000
I think the Simpsons one was, but it was where the monitor was, like, so bright you could not...

15:42.000 --> 15:44.000
Like, it's just faded over time.

15:44.000 --> 15:46.000
But it hasn't faded dark. It's faded light.

15:46.000 --> 15:48.000
I'm not sure what causes that. Maybe sun fading or something?

15:48.000 --> 15:50.000
Even though it's in the dark room.

15:50.000 --> 15:55.000
Well, probably what happened was it burned in and they just turned the brightness up.

15:55.000 --> 15:58.000
Ah, I see. To try and avoid that. I get it.

15:58.000 --> 16:00.000
My gaming week. Some of the things I played this week.

16:00.000 --> 16:02.000
I did play a couple new games.

16:02.000 --> 16:05.000
Obviously Steam is having an obscene sale right now.

16:05.000 --> 16:07.000
As DarkSakura mentioned earlier, she picked up Braid.

16:07.000 --> 16:12.000
I picked up Luminous because the basic and advanced pack were on sale a couple days ago for three bucks.

16:12.000 --> 16:17.000
So I was like, eh, what the hell. I own Luminous on just about every other platform. I'll get it on PC as well.

16:17.000 --> 16:20.000
So, you know, that was cool. It's the same game.

16:20.000 --> 16:26.000
Certainly plays better than the iPhone one, although I still think the most underrated one is still the best one.

16:26.000 --> 16:28.000
And that was Luminous 2 on the PSP.

16:28.000 --> 16:31.000
I actually like the licensed music. Thank you very much.

16:31.000 --> 16:36.000
And it's kind of a pity that it didn't catch on a little more or else maybe we could have had a Luminous 3, a real one,

16:36.000 --> 16:42.000
instead of just port after port after port of the same old game with some mediocre skins.

16:42.000 --> 16:45.000
I mean, the skins that are in the game are okay. Nothing that special.

16:45.000 --> 16:50.000
There's no shining. It's not even any Hollaback Girl, just so you know.

16:50.000 --> 16:52.000
Other stuff I played this week.

16:52.000 --> 16:56.000
Saw a demo for a game called Crayon Physics, which was also on Steam.

16:56.000 --> 16:59.000
It was interesting. It was a very DS-inspired game

16:59.000 --> 17:04.000
because you would basically have this little ball on your screen that, you know, you had to get the ball to the star.

17:04.000 --> 17:06.000
And you did that by drawing ramps.

17:06.000 --> 17:13.000
Or it was kind of interesting, like, you might have a little, like, a place where, like, a screw or a bolt is.

17:13.000 --> 17:16.000
And so you draw a hammer or something around the screw.

17:16.000 --> 17:19.000
And then it makes the hammer swing and, like, knock the ball.

17:19.000 --> 17:22.000
Like it's croquet or something knocks the ball across the screen.

17:22.000 --> 17:27.000
So kind of inventive, although it's kind of more the game I think I would imagine on the DS.

17:27.000 --> 17:31.000
But certainly, you know, not everybody owns a DS, but a lot of people own a PC.

17:31.000 --> 17:34.000
So this is a way for you to get into those kinds of games.

17:34.000 --> 17:36.000
I felt the game was a little basic.

17:36.000 --> 17:39.000
And the music was kind of crack.

17:39.000 --> 17:45.000
Like, it was really, like, trippy, scary almost, how happy trippy it was.

17:45.000 --> 17:47.000
It was a little bit frightening.

17:47.000 --> 17:49.000
Best description ever. Happy trippy.

17:49.000 --> 17:50.000
Happy trippy.

17:50.000 --> 17:54.000
That's actually going to be 2DX 19th style or whatever they're up to now.

17:54.000 --> 17:56.000
Happy trippy.

17:56.000 --> 18:01.000
And DarkSakura holds up the thumb hat as she's talking there.

18:01.000 --> 18:05.000
So happy trippy thumb hat, 2DX 19th style.

18:05.000 --> 18:07.000
Let's see, what are the games I play this week?

18:07.000 --> 18:10.000
Tekken 6 I checked out for a little bit.

18:10.000 --> 18:16.000
I have to admit, my reaction to Tekken 6 after having spent a little time with it is,

18:16.000 --> 18:18.000
lol what?

18:18.000 --> 18:23.000
Like, that was honestly pretty much the reaction I had every few minutes we were playing Tekken 6.

18:23.000 --> 18:25.000
Lol what?

18:25.000 --> 18:30.000
Dude is wearing pink pants and shoots electricity out of his hands while he's standing in water.

18:30.000 --> 18:32.000
Lol what?

18:32.000 --> 18:38.000
There's a giant transformer guy who shoots laser beams into the floor that makes me fall through and I instantly lose.

18:38.000 --> 18:41.000
Lol what?

18:41.000 --> 18:48.000
The last boss looks like Zombie Big Bird 8, like, Ra from Stargate and is glowing blue.

18:48.000 --> 18:50.000
Lol what is this game?

18:50.000 --> 18:52.000
Did we have any Voldo?

18:52.000 --> 18:55.000
Mr. Bondage Crotch?

18:55.000 --> 19:00.000
There's 40 fucking characters in the game and, you know, Tekken has obviously been lol what for a little while.

19:00.000 --> 19:04.000
It had the panda bears and the kangaroos.

19:04.000 --> 19:09.000
Voldo was so caliber, but I know that they brought in, like, some of the really weirdo ones.

19:09.000 --> 19:11.000
Well, of course, anything with Yoshimitsu in it is going to be...

19:11.000 --> 19:13.000
The training dummy.

19:13.000 --> 19:15.000
Did you play as Panda?

19:15.000 --> 19:19.000
I didn't play as Panda. I played with my favorite tranny bitch, Anna Williams.

19:19.000 --> 19:23.000
I'm telling you, in Tekken 6, she is one fierce transsexual.

19:23.000 --> 19:25.000
Obviously, I mean, no disrespect.

19:25.000 --> 19:32.000
She just looks like your stereotypical, like, wearing all the leopard stuff and the boots and all that.

19:32.000 --> 19:36.000
Like, literally, one of her moves, you know how everybody has a throw?

19:36.000 --> 19:41.000
One of her moves, she grabs the guy, slaps him three times in the face, and then throws him.

19:41.000 --> 19:42.000
And then the other one...

19:42.000 --> 19:44.000
She's always had that move.

19:44.000 --> 19:47.000
She flips the guy over and, I swear to God, kicks him in the taint.

19:47.000 --> 19:49.000
Like, get out of here!

19:49.000 --> 19:51.000
Yeah, that's her.

19:51.000 --> 19:53.000
Well, you know what?

19:53.000 --> 19:56.000
I always thought that she was, like, an extra from Ab Fab.

19:56.000 --> 19:58.000
You know?

19:58.000 --> 20:00.000
Because we had to break out a cigarette and go,

20:00.000 --> 20:02.000
I feel peckish.

20:02.000 --> 20:05.000
And TigerClaws is saying about my Twitter earlier this week,

20:05.000 --> 20:08.000
Oh, yeah, I read about your reaction. One of the characters is a tranny.

20:08.000 --> 20:12.000
Not really. Just kind of has all those, like, stereotypes you would see.

20:12.000 --> 20:15.000
I think, honestly, Anna Williams would actually best be described as,

20:15.000 --> 20:21.000
if you ever saw the movie Angel from, like, 1981,

20:21.000 --> 20:25.000
where she's a prostitute by night and an FBI agent by day,

20:25.000 --> 20:28.000
that's the best way I could describe Anna Williams.

20:28.000 --> 20:31.000
I know. Lul, what?

20:31.000 --> 20:34.000
So that was pretty much my review of Tekken 6. Lul, what?

20:34.000 --> 20:38.000
Although, I thought it was interesting that in certain parts of the game,

20:38.000 --> 20:42.000
if you're playing offline mode, it kind of simulates an online mode.

20:42.000 --> 20:45.000
You'll be playing against people with these fake gamer tags

20:45.000 --> 20:48.000
that you're playing for promotions.

20:48.000 --> 20:52.000
Like, I was watching my friend play, and he got into one of these battles,

20:52.000 --> 20:54.000
and he was like, What the hell? I thought I was playing offline mode.

20:54.000 --> 20:56.000
I don't want to fight people online.

20:56.000 --> 20:59.000
You know, put the record at stake when you're not really, you know,

20:59.000 --> 21:02.000
or just the fact that online players can sometimes be douchebags.

21:02.000 --> 21:04.000
You don't really want to play with them.

21:04.000 --> 21:07.000
But it simulates this whole thing in offline mode,

21:07.000 --> 21:09.000
which is kind of strange but cool.

21:09.000 --> 21:12.000
The game is actually a lot more deep than I'm giving it credit for.

21:12.000 --> 21:17.000
Keep in mind I only looked at a couple modes on this particular outing with the game.

21:17.000 --> 21:20.000
Didn't really get too in-depth with the game, but yeah.

21:20.000 --> 21:22.000
Lul, what?

21:22.000 --> 21:23.000
That's pretty much it.

21:23.000 --> 21:26.000
Also, AlphaCananagram in chat says,

21:26.000 --> 21:28.000
Skye, it's ghost data of players.

21:28.000 --> 21:30.000
That's kind of strange to me.

21:30.000 --> 21:32.000
Like, are they actual real people?

21:32.000 --> 21:35.000
Because I saw, like, at signs and other signs

21:35.000 --> 21:40.000
that I didn't think you could have in your gamertag as part of the people that we're fighting against.

21:40.000 --> 21:42.000
That's weird that you can fight against ghosts.

21:42.000 --> 21:45.000
I guess the chatters are sending me straight that those are ghosts.

21:45.000 --> 21:47.000
They were around in Tekken 5, says Hitstun.

21:47.000 --> 21:50.000
To be fair, I didn't play Tekken 5, so okay.

21:50.000 --> 21:52.000
Maybe that's just a new feature I wasn't aware of.

21:52.000 --> 21:54.000
Well, that's kind of freaky then.

21:54.000 --> 21:56.000
What if I don't want my ghosts to be online?

21:56.000 --> 22:00.000
Hitstun says, pretty cool, but they really only copied the user's combos.

22:00.000 --> 22:03.000
Which really is what Tekken's all about.

22:03.000 --> 22:05.000
There's not...

22:05.000 --> 22:11.000
Tekken is not the fighting game with fireballs and all these insane moves.

22:11.000 --> 22:14.000
Really, there's only low punch, high punch, low kick, high kick.

22:14.000 --> 22:17.000
And those are pretty much all the buttons you use to do everything in Tekken.

22:17.000 --> 22:20.000
And you just string all these combos and juggle, et cetera, et cetera.

22:22.000 --> 22:24.000
AlphaCananagram also adds in,

22:24.000 --> 22:26.000
Tekken 6 has been in arcades for years,

22:26.000 --> 22:28.000
so they get data from arcade machines.

22:28.000 --> 22:30.000
Okay. Interesting.

22:30.000 --> 22:32.000
I guess having that kind of come to light,

22:32.000 --> 22:34.000
obviously the game doesn't explain that to you.

22:34.000 --> 22:36.000
I find that feature to be very interesting,

22:36.000 --> 22:39.000
but it doesn't really change my little what reaction to the game.

22:39.000 --> 22:41.000
Anyhow.

22:43.000 --> 22:45.000
Let's see, other games I played this week.

22:45.000 --> 22:47.000
A lot of World of Warcraft still.

22:47.000 --> 22:49.000
I already have a level 80 character.

22:49.000 --> 22:51.000
I've had one for a couple years.

22:51.000 --> 22:53.000
But now my new character I'm trying to get to 80,

22:53.000 --> 22:55.000
my Paladin, my Dwarf Paladin.

22:55.000 --> 22:58.000
She is level 78, two bubbles away from 79.

22:58.000 --> 23:00.000
Very, very close to level 80.

23:00.000 --> 23:03.000
And I'm excited because I'll actually be able to use the new Dungeon Finder with that.

23:03.000 --> 23:05.000
Hold on. I've got something for you guys.

23:05.000 --> 23:06.000
Oh.

23:06.000 --> 23:07.000
Fill time.

23:07.000 --> 23:09.000
All right. Fill time.

23:09.000 --> 23:11.000
Well, I was going to actually mention something about this.

23:11.000 --> 23:13.000
Speaking of Warcraft and all this stuff,

23:13.000 --> 23:15.000
I don't usually listen to other podcasts,

23:15.000 --> 23:18.000
and I've kind of talked about why on the show before.

23:18.000 --> 23:21.000
I mean, obviously I listen to Bobby Black Wolf because he's live before we are.

23:21.000 --> 23:23.000
And I listen to most of his show because of that.

23:23.000 --> 23:27.000
But I don't want to inadvertently take ideas from other shows or what have you

23:27.000 --> 23:29.000
and all this other stuff.

23:29.000 --> 23:31.000
Oh, my gosh. Thank you.

23:31.000 --> 23:33.000
Dr. Sakura is handing out presents.

23:33.000 --> 23:34.000
Yay.

23:34.000 --> 23:35.000
Hold on. I'll open that in a minute.

23:35.000 --> 23:40.000
But on Christmas Day, Scott Rubin, who is the ringleader of allgames.com,

23:40.000 --> 23:43.000
if you weren't already aware, was doing like a marathon live show.

23:43.000 --> 23:45.000
He was live for like five or six hours that day.

23:45.000 --> 23:48.000
And I actually called him and talked to him for a little while.

23:48.000 --> 23:49.000
It was pretty cool.

23:49.000 --> 23:51.000
I'm pretty sure it will be archived on All Games Radio's site.

23:51.000 --> 23:53.000
You can check that out.

23:53.000 --> 23:55.000
We talked a long time about digital distribution.

23:55.000 --> 23:57.000
I think he's very pro-digital distribution.

23:57.000 --> 24:00.000
We had a little lively debate about that.

24:00.000 --> 24:04.000
But I tuned in later on the iPhone app in my car

24:04.000 --> 24:07.000
because I was driving to San Francisco Christmas night

24:07.000 --> 24:10.000
and I wanted to listen to more talk radio I thought would be good for the drive.

24:10.000 --> 24:11.000
But he wasn't on anymore.

24:11.000 --> 24:15.000
Instead, this other program was on talking about nothing but World of Warcraft.

24:15.000 --> 24:18.000
And it's called the Warcraft Outsiders,

24:18.000 --> 24:20.000
which I think is a spinoff of Video Game Outsiders,

24:20.000 --> 24:22.000
another All Games Radio program on the network.

24:22.000 --> 24:26.000
I have to say, as much as I don't often listen to other podcasts,

24:26.000 --> 24:28.000
I thought they did a pretty good job.

24:28.000 --> 24:32.000
They knew their stuff talking about Warcraft and I thought it was interesting.

24:32.000 --> 24:35.000
Since I play the game all the time,

24:35.000 --> 24:37.000
I wasn't hearing a lot of news that I didn't already know,

24:37.000 --> 24:40.000
but I kind of liked hearing about their experiences.

24:40.000 --> 24:42.000
The gal they have on that show, I think her name is Michelle,

24:42.000 --> 24:44.000
was kind of like the ringleader of that show,

24:44.000 --> 24:46.000
at least the particular episode I was listening to.

24:46.000 --> 24:48.000
She knows her shit on Warcraft.

24:48.000 --> 24:50.000
I was very impressed.

24:50.000 --> 24:53.000
She's a pretty hardcore raider and all that stuff.

24:53.000 --> 24:56.000
It was a good show, so I wanted to give them a shout-out

24:56.000 --> 25:01.000
because we don't often give the other All Games Radio shows enough shout-outs here,

25:01.000 --> 25:05.000
but we are all about supporting other independent radio and independent podcasts.

25:05.000 --> 25:08.000
Just because I say I personally don't listen to a lot of other podcasts

25:08.000 --> 25:09.000
doesn't mean you shouldn't.

25:09.000 --> 25:13.000
You should go out there and support all the other podcasts out there,

25:13.000 --> 25:16.000
especially if you decide Orange Launch Radio is not your cup of tea.

25:16.000 --> 25:18.000
I bet there is another show on the network.

25:18.000 --> 25:21.000
It is their cup of tea, so check that out.

25:21.000 --> 25:23.000
Now.

25:23.000 --> 25:24.000
Now.

25:24.000 --> 25:25.000
Now what? Open present?

25:25.000 --> 25:26.000
Now.

25:26.000 --> 25:27.000
Me first or Loki first?

25:27.000 --> 25:30.000
You throw your card, so go ahead.

25:30.000 --> 25:32.000
La la la card.

25:32.000 --> 25:35.000
Crap.

25:35.000 --> 25:37.000
It's a card, and on the tree it says,

25:37.000 --> 25:39.000
wow, those are some really big balls,

25:39.000 --> 25:41.000
and the guy says, thanks.

25:41.000 --> 25:46.000
And it says, have a great big merry Christmas.

25:46.000 --> 25:48.000
Get it? The tree had big balls on it.

25:48.000 --> 25:50.000
I just fucked up my little hat.

25:50.000 --> 25:51.000
Now I'm going to open up this box.

25:51.000 --> 25:53.000
I don't want to ruin it.

25:53.000 --> 25:55.000
It's his box, Rob. It cost a dollar.

25:55.000 --> 25:57.000
This is terrible radio, though.

25:57.000 --> 26:03.000
Hold on. I'm opening a box, folks.

26:03.000 --> 26:04.000
No, it's not a dick in a box.

26:04.000 --> 26:06.000
Oh, snap.

26:06.000 --> 26:08.000
It is a...

26:08.000 --> 26:11.000
Oh, cool. World of Warcraft year of here.

26:11.000 --> 26:14.000
It's like a 365-day calendar.

26:14.000 --> 26:15.000
I'm assuming like a desk calendar.

26:15.000 --> 26:16.000
Yep.

26:16.000 --> 26:18.000
That shows little locales in the World of Warcraft.

26:18.000 --> 26:20.000
I will totally take this to work, and they'll really think I'm a freak.

26:20.000 --> 26:22.000
It'll be awesome.

26:22.000 --> 26:23.000
Oh, that's why I bought it.

26:23.000 --> 26:24.000
Great. That's cool.

26:24.000 --> 26:25.000
It's for people to think you're a freak.

26:25.000 --> 26:27.000
Like on Tuesday, the 26th of January,

26:27.000 --> 26:30.000
there's a little picture of the Violet Hold.

26:30.000 --> 26:33.000
On Thursday, the 8th of July, there's a picture of Icecrown Citadel.

26:33.000 --> 26:36.000
They just have all these little pictures from around Warcraft.

26:36.000 --> 26:37.000
That's kind of neat.

26:37.000 --> 26:38.000
Yeah, I saw it, and I thought you'd appreciate it.

26:38.000 --> 26:39.000
There's a vast world in Warcraft.

26:39.000 --> 26:40.000
That's one of the reasons to play.

26:40.000 --> 26:41.000
Pretty awesome.

26:41.000 --> 26:42.000
Okay, so, Loki.

26:42.000 --> 26:44.000
Open your box, Loki.

26:44.000 --> 26:45.000
Do it.

26:45.000 --> 26:47.000
My card says, bacon, how'd you know?

26:47.000 --> 26:53.000
And it's a dog jumping up and down because he got a box full of bacon.

26:53.000 --> 26:55.000
Hope you get just what you're looking for this Christmas.

26:55.000 --> 26:56.000
Is that what you got?

26:56.000 --> 26:57.000
A box full of bacon?

26:57.000 --> 26:58.000
Well, I don't know.

26:58.000 --> 26:59.000
Open your box!

26:59.000 --> 27:00.000
What's in the box?

27:00.000 --> 27:01.000
What's in the box?

27:01.000 --> 27:02.000
Do it!

27:02.000 --> 27:03.000
La, la, box.

27:03.000 --> 27:04.000
What's in the fucking box?

27:04.000 --> 27:05.000
La, la, box.

27:05.000 --> 27:09.000
Tell me what's in the box.

27:09.000 --> 27:12.000
Loki's opening his box very slowly.

27:12.000 --> 27:16.000
So, Rob, did you see the thing that I posted on Facebook earlier?

27:16.000 --> 27:21.000
The 30 seconds of Lich King?

27:21.000 --> 27:22.000
Uh-uh.

27:22.000 --> 27:26.000
I got the worst case scenario daily survival calendar 2010.

27:26.000 --> 27:27.000
Nice.

27:27.000 --> 27:31.000
Day-to-day guide to surviving a year's worth of peril.

27:31.000 --> 27:35.000
Isn't this what inspired your old advice column you used to do?

27:35.000 --> 27:36.000
Yes.

27:36.000 --> 27:40.000
I used to have this calendar a few years ago, and I remember just cracking up on a daily

27:40.000 --> 27:45.000
basis, and I figured that Loki would appreciate some advice, like how to deliver a baby.

27:45.000 --> 27:46.000
In a mall.

27:46.000 --> 27:47.000
Very nice.

27:47.000 --> 27:50.000
How to control a runaway camel.

27:50.000 --> 27:53.000
How to navigate a minefield successfully.

27:53.000 --> 27:55.000
And how to drive Santa's sleigh.

27:55.000 --> 28:00.000
If you can find some old-ass episodes of our to-go show, which I think was around 2005,

28:00.000 --> 28:06.000
2006, when we first were getting into podcasting, we would do like a three to four hour live

28:06.000 --> 28:10.000
show, then record another hour that was separately podcast.

28:10.000 --> 28:14.000
We merged the shows finally, got smart and merged them together finally a couple years

28:14.000 --> 28:18.000
later, but if you can find some old episodes of the to-go show, it was really funny, because

28:18.000 --> 28:22.000
Dark Sakura had these little advice columns that were like, lol what?

28:22.000 --> 28:28.000
They have some pretty appropriate stuff, like for example, New Year's Day, it's an essential

28:28.000 --> 28:32.000
survivor knowledge appropriate attire for winter weather.

28:32.000 --> 28:34.000
Really this should be the date before.

28:34.000 --> 28:38.000
How to carry someone who has passed out.

28:38.000 --> 28:39.000
Very useful.

28:39.000 --> 28:45.000
I freaking love worst case scenario, so I thought that maybe Loki would too.

28:45.000 --> 28:49.000
How to deflect a deflect encounter or a sword blow.

28:49.000 --> 28:53.000
Well it was either that or I was trying to decide who I was going to give the bitch a

28:53.000 --> 28:54.000
day calendar to.

28:54.000 --> 29:00.000
How does it actually have 365 bitches on it or is it like complaints?

29:00.000 --> 29:05.000
It's like those magnet that you have the one that says remember when fat butts were in

29:05.000 --> 29:12.000
there, or the I'm having screaming PMS with a really happy looking 40's chick on there.

29:12.000 --> 29:14.000
That type of thing.

29:14.000 --> 29:16.000
It was all stuff like that.

29:16.000 --> 29:19.000
How to land a runaway hire balloon.

29:19.000 --> 29:20.000
Just in case.

29:20.000 --> 29:21.000
You never know, Loki.

29:21.000 --> 29:22.000
You never know.

29:22.000 --> 29:23.000
You might need it.

29:23.000 --> 29:24.000
Rama in chat is bragging.

29:24.000 --> 29:26.000
He has all of the OLR to-go podcasts.

29:26.000 --> 29:30.000
I thought there was an archive online somewhere, and I know there's like, and Dark Tetsuya is

29:30.000 --> 29:33.000
talking about the descriptions on the wiki, and I haven't talked about this a lot on the

29:33.000 --> 29:39.000
show, but on Wikia.com, there's actually a whole Orange Lounge Radio wiki that you can

29:39.000 --> 29:43.000
look up, and it actually has like descriptions of the years and years worth of shows we've

29:43.000 --> 29:46.000
done ever since the very first one on June 23rd of 2002.

29:46.000 --> 29:48.000
The one that I had the screaming migraine during?

29:48.000 --> 29:49.000
Yes.

29:49.000 --> 29:50.000
The very first show.

29:50.000 --> 29:51.000
Crazy.

29:51.000 --> 29:52.000
So.

29:52.000 --> 29:53.000
Anyhow.

29:53.000 --> 29:56.000
Alright, well we've got to do our 350th show.

29:56.000 --> 29:58.000
It's somewhat of a landmark number, yes?

29:58.000 --> 29:59.000
Multiple of 50?

29:59.000 --> 30:01.000
By the way.

30:01.000 --> 30:02.000
Who's the baby on your screen right now on Facebook?

30:02.000 --> 30:04.000
That's our friend Megumi's baby.

30:04.000 --> 30:05.000
Luke.

30:05.000 --> 30:06.000
Aww.

30:06.000 --> 30:07.000
That's cute.

30:07.000 --> 30:08.000
He's cute.

30:08.000 --> 30:09.000
I know, it's great radio, but.

30:09.000 --> 30:13.000
Although that reaction is somewhat like, did you ever see Bat Boy on the World News?

30:13.000 --> 30:14.000
No.

30:14.000 --> 30:15.000
Cover?

30:15.000 --> 30:16.000
With a rah!

30:16.000 --> 30:17.000
With a face?

30:17.000 --> 30:20.000
That's just a cute little baby yawn.

30:20.000 --> 30:21.000
Alright.

30:21.000 --> 30:25.000
Anyhow, let's get into some housekeeping real quick.

30:25.000 --> 30:26.000
Of course, we're on Twitter.

30:26.000 --> 30:27.000
Twitter.com slash OLR.

30:27.000 --> 30:29.000
We also have a Facebook now.

30:29.000 --> 30:31.000
Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.

30:31.000 --> 30:34.000
You should definitely follow us on those sites.

30:34.000 --> 30:38.000
We will still be here live next Sunday and the Sunday after.

30:38.000 --> 30:43.000
I do not know yet what the plan is for the show on January the...

30:43.000 --> 30:45.000
I'm looking at my calendar here.

30:45.000 --> 30:46.000
January the 17th.

30:46.000 --> 30:47.000
I'm going to be out of town.

30:47.000 --> 30:50.000
I'm going to Seattle for the long weekend because that is Martin Luther King weekend.

30:50.000 --> 30:52.000
We have that day off of work.

30:52.000 --> 30:55.000
When Southwest had an Uber sale, I booked a trip to Seattle.

30:55.000 --> 30:58.000
I'll be gone that Sunday, so we'll figure out what we're doing then.

30:58.000 --> 31:02.000
I hear there's a best of in the works, so maybe that'll finally be ready by that week.

31:02.000 --> 31:03.000
I'm not sure.

31:03.000 --> 31:04.000
Just so you know.

31:04.000 --> 31:06.000
Alright, let's get into some gaming news.

31:06.000 --> 31:08.000
Believe it or not, we have some gaming news tonight.

31:08.000 --> 31:10.000
Tonight in part A, we're going to do kind of our usual thing,

31:10.000 --> 31:11.000
talking about the news that happened this week,

31:11.000 --> 31:15.000
even though it was a little bit of a slow news week with the holidays in the States and all.

31:15.000 --> 31:19.000
And then in part B, we're going to really talk about the year in review and the decade in review,

31:19.000 --> 31:23.000
as I'm sure a lot of your favorite shows are doing this week because it was a slow news week.

31:23.000 --> 31:25.000
That's kind of what people talk about during the holidays.

31:25.000 --> 31:27.000
So, Loki, start us off tonight with some news.

31:27.000 --> 31:28.000
Yes.

31:28.000 --> 31:33.000
Capcom has decided to pull a few games from their Quarter 1 2010 lineup,

31:33.000 --> 31:40.000
including Super Street Fighter IV, Lost Planet 2, and Monster Hunter Tri.

31:40.000 --> 31:47.000
And from what I've seen, they haven't really announced yet when they're going to put these games out.

31:47.000 --> 31:55.000
My guess would be not far after the first quarter, which ends, of course, April 1, 2010.

31:55.000 --> 32:03.000
So, basically, these games are scheduled to come out any time between April 1, 2010 and March 31, 2011,

32:03.000 --> 32:07.000
because they're delayed to their fiscal 2011 year.

32:07.000 --> 32:10.000
And they said they're planning on spreading them across all four quarters,

32:10.000 --> 32:16.000
which makes sense if you think about it because Capcom usually frontloads the first part of the year with their games,

32:16.000 --> 32:21.000
and I'm sure that a lot of the stuff that they put out ends up competing with itself.

32:21.000 --> 32:24.000
So, it kind of makes sense that you would want to spread that out.

32:24.000 --> 32:27.000
And they still do have some stuff coming out in the first quarter.

32:27.000 --> 32:33.000
They have Tatsunoko vs. Capcom, Ultimate All-Stars, and, of course, Dark Void coming out as well.

32:33.000 --> 32:40.000
And that's not even including the other things that they're planning on releasing digital distribution-wise,

32:40.000 --> 32:43.000
including Mega Man 10.

32:43.000 --> 32:46.000
So, a lot of stuff coming out still.

32:46.000 --> 32:50.000
It's still a little bit disappointing, though, because when I read the article, what you say makes a lot of sense.

32:50.000 --> 32:55.000
They don't want to load the year too front-heavy, I guess, for lack of a better term.

32:55.000 --> 32:58.000
But there were some big, you know, like Super Street Fighter IV,

32:58.000 --> 33:01.000
I had the feeling we were going to be playing it come February or March.

33:01.000 --> 33:02.000
I still think we may.

33:02.000 --> 33:06.000
I still think it may come out in like April or May, not too far from where it was,

33:06.000 --> 33:10.000
because originally it was kind of slated around March,

33:10.000 --> 33:14.000
and I think now it's just going to be coming out slightly later, maybe in April or something.

33:14.000 --> 33:18.000
Same with Monster Hunter Tri and Lost Planet 2.

33:18.000 --> 33:21.000
Dead Rising 2 still at some point.

33:21.000 --> 33:24.000
But, I mean, they have a pretty big slate of games coming out this year.

33:24.000 --> 33:28.000
It's just, you know, not putting them all out at the same time.

33:28.000 --> 33:31.000
Well, since tonight is, in some respects, a year in a review show,

33:31.000 --> 33:33.000
I mean, God, this news is nothing new.

33:33.000 --> 33:36.000
It's like all we've heard over the past four months,

33:36.000 --> 33:40.000
or really ever since probably like July when we were talking about games coming out at the end of the year.

33:40.000 --> 33:43.000
Delay, delay, delay, delay, delay.

33:43.000 --> 33:46.000
Like, I really feel like, you know, we've been doing this show a long time.

33:46.000 --> 33:49.000
I really feel like this year especially.

33:49.000 --> 33:51.000
I mean, games always get delayed. I get that.

33:51.000 --> 33:55.000
But this year especially, I really feel like lots of games got delayed.

33:55.000 --> 33:57.000
Well, a lot of it's because of Modern Warfare 2,

33:57.000 --> 34:00.000
and a lot of people were afraid to kind of take on Modern Warfare 2,

34:00.000 --> 34:03.000
and so they've delayed their games to other parts of the year,

34:03.000 --> 34:05.000
which is fine because I think that's good.

34:05.000 --> 34:08.000
Normally we get these really dead months where there's nothing coming out,

34:08.000 --> 34:11.000
and I'm like, you know, hey, it'd be the perfect time to put this game out

34:11.000 --> 34:13.000
because there's really nothing competing with it right now.

34:13.000 --> 34:16.000
Like April, I mean, most of April's going to be pretty dead.

34:16.000 --> 34:19.000
I mean, you're going to have Red Dead Redemption on the 27th,

34:19.000 --> 34:22.000
but as far as I'm aware, there's normally not much coming out in April.

34:22.000 --> 34:24.000
It's pretty dead.

34:24.000 --> 34:26.000
Isn't that kind of traditional, though, that not much comes out around that time?

34:26.000 --> 34:29.000
Because that's when you're starting to get into finals and college,

34:29.000 --> 34:31.000
which is your big gaming base and so forth.

34:31.000 --> 34:32.000
They don't care about that kind of stuff, though.

34:32.000 --> 34:33.000
They're really...

34:33.000 --> 34:34.000
You don't think that kind of stuff cuts into sales?

34:34.000 --> 34:35.000
No, I don't think it really matters.

34:35.000 --> 34:38.000
I think it's just development cycles and really a lot of this stuff,

34:38.000 --> 34:41.000
you know, they try to push it out before the end of March because...

34:41.000 --> 34:44.000
Wait a minute. Isn't Final Fantasy 13 April, or is that March?

34:44.000 --> 34:45.000
That's March.

34:45.000 --> 34:46.000
Okay, my bad.

34:46.000 --> 34:49.000
Yeah, so Final Fantasy 13's kind of the beginning of March,

34:49.000 --> 34:54.000
but that may be another reason, too, why some of these delays are happening

34:54.000 --> 34:57.000
because if they're coming out around the same time as Final Fantasy 13,

34:57.000 --> 34:58.000
maybe that's another...

34:58.000 --> 35:02.000
Yeah, it's not as big as Modern Warfare 2, but it's going to be pretty big.

35:02.000 --> 35:04.000
And it's a completely different audience, you know what I mean?

35:04.000 --> 35:06.000
Like the kind of people that play Final Fantasy 13

35:06.000 --> 35:08.000
aren't going to play these other types of games.

35:08.000 --> 35:10.000
Well, you know, there's always somebody that plays both.

35:10.000 --> 35:13.000
Well, Monster Hunter, I think, kind of, you know, it's a little similar.

35:13.000 --> 35:15.000
Okay, I can see that kind of having some similar crossover.

35:15.000 --> 35:19.000
Street Fighter, yeah, not much of a crossover there, but still, though, it's, you know...

35:19.000 --> 35:22.000
It's a very similar strategy to how they do movies, right?

35:22.000 --> 35:24.000
You hear about movies getting delayed all the time

35:24.000 --> 35:27.000
because they don't want to compete against another movie that's too similar,

35:27.000 --> 35:31.000
but movies that are completely kind of different is okay.

35:31.000 --> 35:35.000
Like, for instance, a lot of weekends you have a big bang-up action movie

35:35.000 --> 35:39.000
opening up against a movie targeted at women

35:39.000 --> 35:42.000
that's more like, you know, Meryl Streep's vagina, da-da-da.

35:42.000 --> 35:44.000
You know, like all these, you know, kind of softer things

35:44.000 --> 35:46.000
usually open up kind of together.

35:46.000 --> 35:49.000
Like, look at Christmas. We had Sherlock Holmes, Avatar

35:49.000 --> 35:52.000
are both kind of, you know, bang-up action-y type things.

35:52.000 --> 35:54.000
And then you have the Meryl Streep movie.

35:54.000 --> 35:55.000
Oh, yeah.

35:55.000 --> 35:57.000
Alvin and the Chipmunks for kids, you know, different audiences.

35:57.000 --> 36:00.000
And then look at also, like, you know, some of the releases and stuff on different platforms.

36:00.000 --> 36:02.000
You know, the first part of the year so far,

36:02.000 --> 36:06.000
there's not really any first-party Microsoft games coming out,

36:06.000 --> 36:07.000
at least in the first quarter.

36:07.000 --> 36:10.000
I've seen there's nothing coming out from them yet,

36:10.000 --> 36:12.000
or it has been announced.

36:12.000 --> 36:14.000
You know, I'm kind of surprised there.

36:14.000 --> 36:17.000
I would have thought, you know, maybe Crackdown 2 might be coming out.

36:17.000 --> 36:23.000
Or, hey, even, you know, maybe...

36:23.000 --> 36:26.000
Oh, what was it?

36:26.000 --> 36:28.000
I can't remember the name of the game now.

36:28.000 --> 36:30.000
Oh, that's all right, because I'm not buying it.

36:30.000 --> 36:33.000
The other Microsoft, Alan Wake, that's right.

36:33.000 --> 36:36.000
The one that's been delayed forever, you know.

36:36.000 --> 36:38.000
It probably won't be that great.

36:38.000 --> 36:40.000
Oh, it looks all right.

36:40.000 --> 36:45.000
But I guess it's good that they're delaying stuff just a little bit, you know,

36:45.000 --> 36:49.000
and it kind of sucks because they have to kind of lower their projections

36:49.000 --> 36:53.000
for how they're going to finish up their, you know, 2010 financial year.

36:53.000 --> 36:56.000
But in the end, I think it's going to end up being more beneficial to them

36:56.000 --> 37:01.000
because they're going to be able to capitalize on these dead parts of, you know, the year

37:01.000 --> 37:05.000
and maybe not necessarily competing with these big blockbuster games.

37:05.000 --> 37:08.000
But then again, you know, you have these companies that still put out everything in the fourth quarter,

37:08.000 --> 37:10.000
like Activision, you know.

37:10.000 --> 37:14.000
They put their big games right there in November, October.

37:14.000 --> 37:17.000
And, you know, I don't think this year is going to be different.

37:17.000 --> 37:20.000
Obviously, you're going to have another Call of Duty game

37:20.000 --> 37:28.000
and some more Guitar Hero games and some more, you know, DJ Hero and who knows what.

37:28.000 --> 37:30.000
Hmm.

37:30.000 --> 37:32.000
It's definitely going to be a busy year next year,

37:32.000 --> 37:33.000
but then I wonder how much we're going to hear next year.

37:33.000 --> 37:36.000
Delayed again, delayed again, lololol.

37:36.000 --> 37:38.000
There's going to be a lot of stuff that's delayed.

37:38.000 --> 37:41.000
Natal delayed, Sony Motion delayed, hahaha.

37:41.000 --> 37:42.000
That's the other thing too.

37:42.000 --> 37:46.000
There's a lot of that stuff coming out, you know, kind of in the,

37:46.000 --> 37:48.000
I want to say it was supposed to be the second quarter,

37:48.000 --> 37:52.000
and maybe some of these games are going to use some of that.

37:52.000 --> 37:54.000
Maybe they're delaying it because of that.

37:54.000 --> 37:56.000
Or maybe they're going to delay them to add that kind of stuff.

37:56.000 --> 37:59.000
Or maybe, I don't know.

37:59.000 --> 38:01.000
Or maybe we're talking out our ass because we don't really know.

38:01.000 --> 38:03.000
We don't know. We can only guess.

38:03.000 --> 38:06.000
All right. Hey, speaking of talking out your ass about things you may not know about,

38:06.000 --> 38:08.000
it's sure fun to speculate what this is all about.

38:08.000 --> 38:12.000
Apparently, in Europe, Namco Bandai has made a new trademark.

38:12.000 --> 38:16.000
It's called Pac-Man Battle Royale.

38:16.000 --> 38:17.000
Don't know what the heck that could be.

38:17.000 --> 38:20.000
Could that be a fighting game involving Pac-Man?

38:20.000 --> 38:25.000
One of the interesting theories is that it's some type of multiplayer champion edition

38:25.000 --> 38:27.000
because obviously Pac-Man Championship Edition, you know,

38:27.000 --> 38:30.000
really kind of revitalized the series in a way.

38:30.000 --> 38:33.000
Not a lot of previous Pac-Man games have done.

38:33.000 --> 38:35.000
I mean, I don't know if you guys know,

38:35.000 --> 38:39.000
but there's been lots of Pac-Man games since the original and Ms. Pac-Man

38:39.000 --> 38:41.000
and even, like, Junior Pac-Man, some of those things.

38:41.000 --> 38:43.000
Like Pac-Mania and all that.

38:43.000 --> 38:47.000
But then, gosh, there was a lot of, like, weird Pac-Man platformer games.

38:47.000 --> 38:48.000
Pac-Land.

38:48.000 --> 38:51.000
Yeah, and all these weird things that were on PlayStation and so forth.

38:51.000 --> 38:54.000
Pac-Man Championship Edition kind of took the game back to its roots and energized it,

38:54.000 --> 38:57.000
kind of gave it a little bit of a, you know, I don't know,

38:57.000 --> 39:01.000
music game infused boost in a way and more fast-paced action.

39:01.000 --> 39:05.000
It's kind of thought that maybe a sequel to that could be where this is going.

39:05.000 --> 39:07.000
But if I seem to remember right,

39:07.000 --> 39:11.000
the guy who originally made Pac-Man was involved with Championship Edition,

39:11.000 --> 39:14.000
which might be part of the reason why it was so successful.

39:14.000 --> 39:19.000
If he's not involved here, I'm a little worried, but who knows?

39:19.000 --> 39:23.000
But could this be just, like, something very similar to that Pac-Man game that they had

39:23.000 --> 39:26.000
that was originally supposed to come out on the GameCube and never did

39:26.000 --> 39:27.000
or something like that?

39:27.000 --> 39:28.000
Like the versus?

39:28.000 --> 39:29.000
Yeah, like the versus.

39:29.000 --> 39:31.000
It was out, but it was really hard to get, if I remember right,

39:31.000 --> 39:34.000
because Dark Soccer was talking about playing it, I remember, years ago.

39:34.000 --> 39:36.000
She was talking about, you remember Pac-Man versus?

39:36.000 --> 39:37.000
Yeah.

39:37.000 --> 39:39.000
Yeah, that was out, but it was kind of hard to find, wasn't it?

39:39.000 --> 39:41.000
We had a bunch of copies of it.

39:41.000 --> 39:43.000
I don't remember how, maybe a chatter remembers this better.

39:43.000 --> 39:45.000
There was something you had to do to get it.

39:45.000 --> 39:46.000
We had a stack of them and we're giving them out.

39:46.000 --> 39:48.000
Yeah, but you had to get a copy of it somehow.

39:48.000 --> 39:51.000
It was, you probably had that because of Game Store connections,

39:51.000 --> 39:53.000
but there was a way you were supposed to get it.

39:53.000 --> 39:55.000
I don't know if it was, like, a pre-order bonus or what.

39:55.000 --> 39:56.000
I think it was.

39:56.000 --> 39:58.000
I think it was too.

39:58.000 --> 40:02.000
So, anyhow, who knows what this game could be all about,

40:02.000 --> 40:04.000
but of course when I hear Pac-Man Battle Royale,

40:04.000 --> 40:08.000
I don't know about you guys, but I think about the old Japanese movie

40:08.000 --> 40:11.000
where they might strand Pac-Man on a desert island with his peers

40:11.000 --> 40:14.000
and give him only a fan to survive.

40:14.000 --> 40:16.000
Paper plate.

40:16.000 --> 40:19.000
That would be pretty amazing if that was actually the case,

40:19.000 --> 40:20.000
but I somehow doubt that.

40:20.000 --> 40:22.000
Hey, I've won Paper Plate Battle Royale.

40:22.000 --> 40:25.000
I just can't see an M-rated Pac-Man game for the life of me.

40:25.000 --> 40:26.000
No.

40:26.000 --> 40:27.000
Although it would be funny.

40:27.000 --> 40:31.000
Well, how about something that is a little bit more on the mature level,

40:31.000 --> 40:33.000
even if it's not M-rated?

40:33.000 --> 40:37.000
My single favorite Castlevania game ever,

40:37.000 --> 40:40.000
Dracula X Rondo of Blood,

40:40.000 --> 40:42.000
is coming to Virtual Console.

40:42.000 --> 40:44.000
It's about damn time.

40:44.000 --> 40:46.000
But, um, guess where?

40:46.000 --> 40:47.000
Hmm.

40:47.000 --> 40:48.000
Australia.

40:48.000 --> 40:50.000
Hence my comment before the show.

40:50.000 --> 40:55.000
Well, which only they heard if you're live tonight, but that's alright.

40:55.000 --> 41:00.000
Which is very interesting because Australia has been getting a lot of bad news lately

41:00.000 --> 41:03.000
as far as video games go, so this is kind of interesting.

41:03.000 --> 41:10.000
Well, the OLFC actually has a rating up for,

41:10.000 --> 41:17.000
as is titled Castlevania Rondo of Blood for Virtual Console release.

41:17.000 --> 41:21.000
I hope that we get it over here, but I don't know.

41:21.000 --> 41:23.000
It's such a fun game.

41:23.000 --> 41:27.000
I mean, I hate having to break out the PC Engine every time I want to play it,

41:27.000 --> 41:30.000
or try to find the PSP version.

41:30.000 --> 41:33.000
Honestly, I still prefer the PC Engine version over the PSP.

41:33.000 --> 41:35.000
If this game were to come out on Virtual Console,

41:35.000 --> 41:38.000
wouldn't it be the first PC Engine CD game to do so?

41:38.000 --> 41:41.000
Didn't we get, um, Ys?

41:41.000 --> 41:42.000
No.

41:42.000 --> 41:46.000
I'm sorry, I've got Ys Book 1 and 2 on CD.

41:46.000 --> 41:50.000
I can't remember. There's so many games on Virtual Console now.

41:50.000 --> 41:52.000
I'd have to look at the list.

41:52.000 --> 41:54.000
I think Ys has been revived on the DS.

41:54.000 --> 41:56.000
I know there's been some newer games there, or PSP,

41:56.000 --> 41:59.000
but I don't think the originals ever came to Virtual Console.

41:59.000 --> 42:01.000
I could be wrong. Somebody in chat might correct us.

42:01.000 --> 42:02.000
We'll have to check.

42:02.000 --> 42:03.000
I don't think the originals ever did.

42:03.000 --> 42:06.000
Chatters do our dirty work for us. Go check.

42:06.000 --> 42:08.000
Well, we're trying to talk about the news here.

42:08.000 --> 42:10.000
But the other thing I want to point out, I mean, honestly,

42:10.000 --> 42:13.000
if it's coming to Australia and the technology is there

42:13.000 --> 42:15.000
and the game is going to be ported to work,

42:15.000 --> 42:18.000
don't you think it's going to come out here before too long?

42:18.000 --> 42:20.000
I mean, isn't that just kind of a given?

42:20.000 --> 42:21.000
The economy still loves us.

42:21.000 --> 42:24.000
Very rarely do these games come out in one country

42:24.000 --> 42:26.000
and then never come out in another. You know what I mean?

42:26.000 --> 42:28.000
Why Australia first?

42:28.000 --> 42:31.000
Well, it could just be that maybe that's where the news has leaked.

42:31.000 --> 42:32.000
Maybe it's really planned for everywhere,

42:32.000 --> 42:34.000
but the news has just happened to leak for Australia.

42:34.000 --> 42:38.000
Possibly. Maybe they had to put in their request for rating,

42:38.000 --> 42:39.000
like some earlier date.

42:39.000 --> 42:42.000
Right, and these ratings requests are how game announcements

42:42.000 --> 42:43.000
leak all the freaking time.

42:43.000 --> 42:47.000
They've tried to take measures to stop that here with the ESRB in the States,

42:47.000 --> 42:50.000
but that doesn't change Australia, Europe, and some of the other countries

42:50.000 --> 42:55.000
where we get our titles spoiled from.

42:55.000 --> 42:58.000
Well, you know, I'll have that in an instant.

42:58.000 --> 43:00.000
I know. I will actually check that out too.

43:00.000 --> 43:02.000
It would be finally a way I can actually play this game

43:02.000 --> 43:05.000
because I didn't collect all these systems that Dark Sakura did.

43:05.000 --> 43:06.000
I told you to come up and play it.

43:06.000 --> 43:08.000
I know, but it would be nice to have it in my own house.

43:08.000 --> 43:10.000
I mean, not that I don't enjoy spending time with Dark Sakura,

43:10.000 --> 43:12.000
but it would be nice to fire it up whenever I want.

43:12.000 --> 43:14.000
If I want to play at 2 a.m., I don't have to call you.

43:14.000 --> 43:16.000
Wednesday.

43:16.000 --> 43:19.000
I don't know yet. I might actually have that day off work,

43:19.000 --> 43:21.000
so I'll let you know. Super.

43:21.000 --> 43:22.000
The end.

43:22.000 --> 43:24.000
Yeah.

43:24.000 --> 43:29.000
So Namco, they've got a lot of great games out there,

43:29.000 --> 43:31.000
and some of those you may have missed.

43:31.000 --> 43:33.000
And some crappy ones too, just for the record.

43:33.000 --> 43:36.000
Some crappy ones you may have missed and may not want to play.

43:36.000 --> 43:38.000
Would you really miss them if they're crappy?

43:38.000 --> 43:40.000
You may not know that you've missed them.

43:40.000 --> 43:42.000
You may just want to collect the achievements and or trophies.

43:42.000 --> 43:43.000
Exactly.

43:43.000 --> 43:46.000
Well, you may get your chance to do that again,

43:46.000 --> 43:50.000
because now they're going to actually be launching their back catalog

43:50.000 --> 43:52.000
via digital distribution.

43:52.000 --> 43:54.000
And this is going to be happening on a few different fronts.

43:54.000 --> 43:56.000
Of course, the Xbox 360.

43:56.000 --> 44:01.000
They're going to be putting up me and my beautiful Katamari

44:01.000 --> 44:03.000
sometime in the first quarter of 2010.

44:03.000 --> 44:05.000
And then on the PlayStation Portable,

44:05.000 --> 44:08.000
me and my Katamari on December 22nd.

44:08.000 --> 44:11.000
So it's already out there if you want to snag that.

44:11.000 --> 44:14.000
And of course, you know, that being said,

44:14.000 --> 44:19.000
they're also planning on putting out other PlayStation 1 and PSP

44:19.000 --> 44:22.000
catalog titles as well on the PlayStation Network.

44:22.000 --> 44:28.000
And there are also maybe other titles coming to the Xbox 360 as well,

44:28.000 --> 44:32.000
but they haven't really named names yet.

44:32.000 --> 44:33.000
So that's kind of neat though.

44:33.000 --> 44:36.000
More Katamari or more of the old Katamari.

44:36.000 --> 44:38.000
Yeah, but that was like the worst Katamari game in the series.

44:38.000 --> 44:41.000
Both of those ones you named were like the low points in the series.

44:41.000 --> 44:43.000
Personally, I did not enjoy Beautiful Katamari.

44:43.000 --> 44:50.000
I have friends that say I'm totally not being fair to that game and so forth.

44:50.000 --> 44:53.000
And maybe they think there's a grudge because of the history our show has

44:53.000 --> 44:55.000
with that particular title.

44:55.000 --> 44:58.000
But no, I think really you put that side by side with Katamari forever

44:58.000 --> 45:01.000
on the PS3, and it just ain't no contest.

45:01.000 --> 45:02.000
The PS3 one's better.

45:02.000 --> 45:05.000
Even though the PS3 one is a rehash of some of the old stuff,

45:05.000 --> 45:07.000
I still say the PS3 one's better.

45:07.000 --> 45:09.000
And just wait for the PS3 one to drop down in price,

45:09.000 --> 45:11.000
because it will pretty quick.

45:11.000 --> 45:14.000
Because it will kind of fade off pretty fast.

45:14.000 --> 45:19.000
And you probably will be able to pick up in the new Katamari game

45:19.000 --> 45:22.000
for 20 bucks or something.

45:22.000 --> 45:26.000
And that's about what you're going to pay for these re-releases.

45:26.000 --> 45:29.000
So just be patient.

45:29.000 --> 45:34.000
Very interesting how digital distribution is kind of best known for this year.

45:34.000 --> 45:37.000
Breathing new life into games that had slipped off the radar,

45:37.000 --> 45:39.000
which is exactly what Namco is doing here.

45:39.000 --> 45:43.000
But I compare this to, you know how Steam is doing their epic sale right now,

45:43.000 --> 45:48.000
where I swear they undercut this shit down to cost just to get people in the door.

45:48.000 --> 45:50.000
They might even be taking losses on it.

45:50.000 --> 45:52.000
I don't know what they're doing,

45:52.000 --> 45:55.000
but they're just trying to get as many Steam subscribers as they can.

45:55.000 --> 46:01.000
But some of the games they're selling would have fallen off the radar a long time ago.

46:01.000 --> 46:06.000
For example, I think they were selling the LucasArts pack for like 3 bucks,

46:06.000 --> 46:08.000
which was the Indiana Jones games,

46:08.000 --> 46:11.000
and Loom and all that was on sale for 3 bucks the other day.

46:11.000 --> 46:14.000
Well, you know, yeah that might be a steal,

46:14.000 --> 46:17.000
but at the same time for the publisher and all the sales people involved,

46:17.000 --> 46:20.000
that's 3 bucks they probably weren't going to get,

46:20.000 --> 46:24.000
because these games are so freaking old, who buys them anymore?

46:24.000 --> 46:27.000
But digital distribution kind of opens it all up.

46:27.000 --> 46:30.000
Very interesting.

46:30.000 --> 46:35.000
Anyhow, moving on to another story and talking about digital distribution of sorts.

46:35.000 --> 46:41.000
There is a new just launched music game store inside the Xbox Live marketplace.

46:41.000 --> 46:45.000
This just went live I believe on the 22nd, so it was a little bit earlier this week,

46:45.000 --> 46:49.000
but now there is a music game store within Xbox Live.

46:49.000 --> 46:52.000
You actually can look at individual stores for Guitar Hero 5,

46:52.000 --> 46:56.000
Guitar Hero World Tour, Band Hero, Lips, Lips No. 1 Hits,

46:56.000 --> 47:00.000
Lego Rock Band, Beatles Rock Band, whatever rock band there is.

47:00.000 --> 47:04.000
They all have these special front end stores where you can actually sample music tracks

47:04.000 --> 47:06.000
and download the songs.

47:06.000 --> 47:08.000
You might be thinking, well I can already do that in the game.

47:08.000 --> 47:12.000
Yeah, you can, but now you can also do it through the Xbox 360 interface,

47:12.000 --> 47:16.000
which is kind of cool that you don't have to go find the disc to put it in the drive

47:16.000 --> 47:18.000
to sample the latest releases,

47:18.000 --> 47:21.000
because sometimes we might be rattling off the releases here on the show,

47:21.000 --> 47:23.000
or you read about them on the internet somewhere and you're like,

47:23.000 --> 47:26.000
I think I remember that song and I think I remember liking it,

47:26.000 --> 47:27.000
but I don't remember what it sounds like.

47:27.000 --> 47:31.000
Now you can just go onto your Xbox and look at the little 30 second sample.

47:31.000 --> 47:34.000
Interesting how music and the Xbox 360 have been fusing together

47:34.000 --> 47:38.000
a little more and more this year, not just with this, but last FM.

47:38.000 --> 47:41.000
If you remember from E3 though, a couple years ago,

47:41.000 --> 47:45.000
they said that that was one of the things that they wanted to do to begin with,

47:45.000 --> 47:51.000
was offer the multimedia interaction with the games.

47:51.000 --> 47:54.000
So there you go.

47:54.000 --> 47:57.000
Yeah, so I have not checked out that storefront myself,

47:57.000 --> 48:01.000
but I'm looking at some of the screenshots and it's nice that every game

48:01.000 --> 48:04.000
kind of gets its own little look and logo and so forth,

48:04.000 --> 48:07.000
but where's Rock Revolution?

48:07.000 --> 48:09.000
Just kidding. I don't care.

48:09.000 --> 48:11.000
Where's the dedicated store?

48:11.000 --> 48:14.000
Oh yeah, in the clearance bin. That's where it is.

48:14.000 --> 48:16.000
$4.99.

48:16.000 --> 48:19.000
Xbox Live should have its own little clearance bin of sorts.

48:19.000 --> 48:22.000
Here's our dumpster, I mean, clearance bin.

48:22.000 --> 48:25.000
It kind of looks like Borderlands. It's like just this wasteland.

48:25.000 --> 48:27.000
I've got a great idea for Microsoft.

48:27.000 --> 48:29.000
You can do something similar to that with Project Natal,

48:29.000 --> 48:34.000
where you actually dig through the clearance bin with your hands,

48:34.000 --> 48:37.000
making different gestures using the Natal camera,

48:37.000 --> 48:42.000
so you can find the Rock Revolution in there for $4.99.

48:42.000 --> 48:43.000
Nice.

48:43.000 --> 48:46.000
Yeah, no one would ever get it.

48:46.000 --> 48:49.000
Let's talk about some news about a game no one cares about.

48:49.000 --> 48:50.000
Okay, what would that be?

48:50.000 --> 48:54.000
Champions Online!

48:54.000 --> 49:00.000
Actually, there is going to be a new update and an iPhone app

49:00.000 --> 49:04.000
and a recruitment initiative.

49:04.000 --> 49:06.000
Please play our game.

49:06.000 --> 49:07.000
I know, right?

49:07.000 --> 49:10.000
There is Champions Companion for the iPhone,

49:10.000 --> 49:15.000
which you can use to review your character and see your online status,

49:15.000 --> 49:20.000
check your friends list, your mail, read news, it's free.

49:20.000 --> 49:22.000
There's also a referral program to where you can invite a friend

49:22.000 --> 49:24.000
to play free for 10 days,

49:24.000 --> 49:29.000
and you will get a rare in-game action figure, boo,

49:29.000 --> 49:31.000
and have some combat buffs.

49:31.000 --> 49:33.000
Ooh!

49:33.000 --> 49:39.000
And you also get another costume slot and 400 cryptic points,

49:39.000 --> 49:42.000
so I guess that's kind of okay.

49:42.000 --> 49:47.000
And then they did an Attack of the Misfit Toys event over the weekend

49:47.000 --> 49:53.000
with new costume pieces, action figures, perks, that type of stuff.

49:53.000 --> 49:54.000
Please come play our game.

49:54.000 --> 49:55.000
I know, right?

49:55.000 --> 49:58.000
We need people.

49:58.000 --> 50:01.000
I think we had a story just like this a couple weeks ago,

50:01.000 --> 50:03.000
but it was Age of Conan.

50:03.000 --> 50:05.000
Very similar type of thing.

50:05.000 --> 50:07.000
They're practically giving the game away to get people to play it.

50:07.000 --> 50:09.000
They already know where it's going to come in,

50:09.000 --> 50:13.000
and that's going to be with Star Trek.

50:13.000 --> 50:15.000
That's what I'm holding out for.

50:15.000 --> 50:17.000
Ironically enough, isn't that what got a lot of people to sign up

50:17.000 --> 50:19.000
for Champions Online in the first place,

50:19.000 --> 50:22.000
was guaranteed access to Star Trek Online's beta or something like that?

50:22.000 --> 50:25.000
I remember if you got an Uber subscription to Champions,

50:25.000 --> 50:28.000
you could play Star Trek Online early or something.

50:28.000 --> 50:30.000
You know what, that wins the whatever award.

50:30.000 --> 50:31.000
That should have been a warning sign right there.

50:31.000 --> 50:34.000
Because I'm already getting a beta.

50:34.000 --> 50:37.000
Our chat room's actually lighting up with comments on the last story

50:37.000 --> 50:39.000
because we're a little bit behind.

50:39.000 --> 50:41.000
It takes time for what we say to encode

50:41.000 --> 50:43.000
and you guys to hear it through the All Games feed and so forth.

50:43.000 --> 50:45.000
They're still talking about Rock Revolution a little bit

50:45.000 --> 50:47.000
because I was giving it a little shit in chat earlier.

50:47.000 --> 50:48.000
Rama in chat says,

50:48.000 --> 50:52.000
Sorry, Rock Revolution was well worth the $5 I paid for it.

50:52.000 --> 50:54.000
Brad from Pod Culture asks,

50:54.000 --> 50:57.000
What sucked more, Rock Revolution or Yaris?

50:57.000 --> 50:59.000
To be fair, Yaris probably sucked more.

50:59.000 --> 51:05.000
Yaris, but for your suck to money value...

51:05.000 --> 51:06.000
Yaris is free.

51:06.000 --> 51:08.000
But here's the thing though about Yaris.

51:08.000 --> 51:13.000
Yaris led way for a whole bunch of piracy on Xbox Live Arcade.

51:13.000 --> 51:14.000
So thank you, Yaris.

51:14.000 --> 51:15.000
I will say this too.

51:15.000 --> 51:18.000
Rock Revolution was actually way better than Beaten Groovy,

51:18.000 --> 51:22.000
which you would also pay, I think, $10 for on Xbox Live Marketplace.

51:22.000 --> 51:24.000
That game was disgusting.

51:24.000 --> 51:26.000
It was insultingly bad.

51:26.000 --> 51:29.000
Whoever allowed that piece of shit to go on Xbox Live Marketplace

51:29.000 --> 51:31.000
should be ashamed of themselves

51:31.000 --> 51:33.000
and should consider possibly retiring from the industry.

51:33.000 --> 51:34.000
It was terrible.

51:34.000 --> 51:39.000
It's not that difficult to make a successful music game, Konami.

51:39.000 --> 51:40.000
I mean, you've done it in the past.

51:40.000 --> 51:42.000
You just kind of have to copy what you did.

51:42.000 --> 51:44.000
But somehow you just fuck it up.

51:44.000 --> 51:45.000
And I don't know how you do that.

51:45.000 --> 51:46.000
It's like,

51:46.000 --> 51:48.000
Ah, they won't get it over in America.

51:48.000 --> 51:50.000
Let's make it all ghetto looking.

51:50.000 --> 51:51.000
Yeah, that's awesome.

51:51.000 --> 51:55.000
Way to shit on your fans.

51:55.000 --> 51:58.000
And trust me, we're not into that over here.

51:58.000 --> 51:59.000
That's other countries.

51:59.000 --> 52:00.000
Yep.

52:00.000 --> 52:04.000
Alright, we're going to travel around the world and look at some release dates.

52:04.000 --> 52:06.000
Hopefully some good things coming out soon.

52:06.000 --> 52:09.000
Although, then again, it's that time of year where probably there ain't shit coming out.

52:09.000 --> 52:11.000
I don't know, Loki. Is that the story here?

52:11.000 --> 52:13.000
I'm pretty sure that's correct.

52:13.000 --> 52:15.000
There is nothing coming out.

52:15.000 --> 52:19.000
And at least last I checked, there was nothing coming out.

52:19.000 --> 52:22.000
And if there is anything coming out this week, it's probably crap.

52:22.000 --> 52:26.000
But, I mean, I guess if you count Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles,

52:26.000 --> 52:28.000
the Crystal Bears came out today.

52:28.000 --> 52:31.000
So that's something, I guess.

52:31.000 --> 52:39.000
And supposedly this week, Divinity II Ego Draconis is supposed to be coming out on PC and Xbox 360.

52:39.000 --> 52:42.000
I thought that was supposed to be next week, but hey.

52:42.000 --> 52:45.000
I could be wrong because they move that stuff around all the time.

52:45.000 --> 52:49.000
And also possibly Learn Chess and Learn Geography on the DS from Dreamcatcher,

52:49.000 --> 52:52.000
which are probably something you can skip.

52:52.000 --> 52:57.000
And then finally, Dreamer Zookeeper on the DS, also from Dreamcatcher.

52:57.000 --> 53:00.000
And World Party Games coming to you on the Wii.

53:00.000 --> 53:03.000
Yes, it's yet another party game collection.

53:03.000 --> 53:08.000
And that's basically it, although don't be surprised if all those move to next week.

53:08.000 --> 53:10.000
Really, it's the same story in Japan.

53:10.000 --> 53:12.000
Literally not a damn thing coming out.

53:12.000 --> 53:14.000
It's very quiet over there right now.

53:14.000 --> 53:19.000
A price reduction on Tactics A2 on the DS is about all you got going for you.

53:19.000 --> 53:23.000
And honestly, there's really not a lot to look forward to until January 9th

53:23.000 --> 53:26.000
when Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep hits the Sony PSP.

53:26.000 --> 53:29.000
That's probably the next big, big release over in Japan.

53:29.000 --> 53:32.000
Yeah, I didn't find a damn thing for Europe, sorry.

53:32.000 --> 53:35.000
It's just that time of year, folks, but we talk about them every week.

53:35.000 --> 53:39.000
So this is a good week to go back and play the games you missed this year in 2009, yes?

53:39.000 --> 53:40.000
Pretty much.

53:40.000 --> 53:41.000
Pretty much.

53:41.000 --> 53:42.000
Pretty much.

53:42.000 --> 53:43.000
All right, so back to some news then.

53:43.000 --> 53:47.000
Yes, so soon, and I'm not sure if this is actually going to happen

53:47.000 --> 53:51.000
because I could think a lot of other people would be pissed off for other reasons.

53:51.000 --> 53:56.000
But pretty soon, you may not be able to play your PSP or DS on airplanes.

53:56.000 --> 54:05.000
Apparently, somebody is trying to consider a ban on all electronic devices aboard planes.

54:05.000 --> 54:13.000
And apparently, the US Transport Security Administration is the one kind of doing that.

54:13.000 --> 54:21.000
Apparently, there is a guy, Omar, I'm not even going to try to pronounce his name anyways,

54:21.000 --> 54:26.000
the guy was arrested after failing to ignite an explosive device on Christmas Day on a plane.

54:26.000 --> 54:28.000
Oh God, I heard about that on CNN.

54:28.000 --> 54:30.000
So that had to do with electronic devices?

54:30.000 --> 54:34.000
Yes, apparently, let's see.

54:34.000 --> 54:37.000
One motherfucker always ruins it for everybody else.

54:37.000 --> 54:41.000
You know how you can't take in water over a certain size

54:41.000 --> 54:45.000
and your shampoo has to be in a clear bottle and in a plastic bag.

54:45.000 --> 54:48.000
I'm not mad, I understand that they're doing it for our safety and what have you,

54:48.000 --> 54:52.000
but it's because some asshole threatened to use it as a bomb

54:52.000 --> 54:56.000
and said that you could use water as a...

54:56.000 --> 54:58.000
It's just frustrating.

54:58.000 --> 55:07.000
Apparently, it doesn't really say if it was an explosive looking like a device or something like that.

55:07.000 --> 55:10.000
They probably don't want to tell you how he did it.

55:10.000 --> 55:13.000
Good old fashioned American paranoia has been increased tenfold.

55:13.000 --> 55:18.000
Following the incident, international flight passengers weren't allowed any personal items on their laps

55:18.000 --> 55:20.000
an hour before the flight.

55:20.000 --> 55:26.000
Full bag searches were instigated at the boarding gates and the ban on electronic devices has said,

55:26.000 --> 55:31.000
to be a reaction to his ability to smuggle an explosive onto the plane.

55:31.000 --> 55:43.000
This would of course mean any DS or PSP would be banned as well as anything from electronic books,

55:43.000 --> 55:46.000
iPods, cell phones, other gaming devices, etc.

55:46.000 --> 55:48.000
That's going to make flights so incredibly boring.

55:48.000 --> 55:51.000
It's not going to fly.

55:51.000 --> 55:53.000
Pun intended.

55:53.000 --> 56:00.000
Honestly, I'm surprised he was able to do that because they scan all that stuff through...

56:00.000 --> 56:02.000
Well, he was on an international flight.

56:02.000 --> 56:04.000
He didn't get screened at a US airport.

56:04.000 --> 56:06.000
He got screened at a Dutch airport.

56:06.000 --> 56:09.000
I don't know what they do over there that's different than what they do over here,

56:09.000 --> 56:11.000
but he didn't get in in the US.

56:11.000 --> 56:12.000
You have a bomb.

56:12.000 --> 56:13.000
No.

56:13.000 --> 56:16.000
Okay, you may go.

56:16.000 --> 56:21.000
You know, I really don't see them banning all electronics on planes.

56:21.000 --> 56:23.000
I think that's a bit much.

56:23.000 --> 56:25.000
And it's going to suck because I know a lot of airlines are looking into,

56:25.000 --> 56:27.000
like I think Virgin Air or one of them,

56:27.000 --> 56:32.000
if they're not already doing it was looking into like free Wi-Fi on flights now.

56:32.000 --> 56:36.000
Like that's what the technology has gotten is you can get on the internet on flights,

56:36.000 --> 56:37.000
which is pretty amazing.

56:37.000 --> 56:39.000
And it would really suck to kind of rip that all away.

56:39.000 --> 56:44.000
But at the end of the day, if there is a true threat, I suppose for lack of a better term,

56:44.000 --> 56:47.000
to, you know, electronic devices on planes,

56:47.000 --> 56:51.000
something that they can't screen for at the airport for God knows whatever reason.

56:51.000 --> 56:52.000
Here's something.

56:52.000 --> 56:53.000
A safety first.

56:53.000 --> 56:54.000
Here's something to...

56:54.000 --> 56:56.000
People didn't have laptops 20 years ago, 30 years ago.

56:56.000 --> 56:58.000
Flights will still work, you know.

56:58.000 --> 57:04.000
Well, what if some dude was to create an EMP bomb using electronic devices?

57:04.000 --> 57:07.000
Can't detect that because it's not an explosive.

57:07.000 --> 57:08.000
The plane would go down.

57:08.000 --> 57:09.000
Exactly.

57:09.000 --> 57:10.000
But that's the point.

57:10.000 --> 57:13.000
They want it to explode or, you know, something.

57:13.000 --> 57:15.000
Someone's probably thought of that.

57:15.000 --> 57:16.000
They have something.

57:16.000 --> 57:19.000
They don't advertise all their countermeasures.

57:19.000 --> 57:21.000
I mean, for obvious reasons.

57:21.000 --> 57:26.000
First of all, if anyone was going to actually be able to project an EMP

57:26.000 --> 57:30.000
that would make a plane go down, it'd be a bigger device.

57:30.000 --> 57:33.000
It wouldn't be something that could be hidden that easily.

57:33.000 --> 57:34.000
I don't know.

57:34.000 --> 57:36.000
I'm just playing devil's advocate.

57:36.000 --> 57:37.000
No, I know.

57:37.000 --> 57:38.000
It's just...

57:38.000 --> 57:41.000
Although that really would be about the only thing I could think of.

57:41.000 --> 57:43.000
SSJ-100 Matt wants to add.

57:43.000 --> 57:47.000
Rob, he hid firecrackers in his crotch.

57:47.000 --> 57:51.000
The Dutch screeners scanned him, but they wouldn't have found them unless they patted him down.

57:51.000 --> 57:52.000
That seems so odd to me.

57:52.000 --> 57:54.000
How a fucking firecracker gonna...

57:54.000 --> 57:57.000
How many did he have in his crotch?

57:57.000 --> 58:01.000
Maybe it was one of those things where, you know, it only takes a spark to ignite

58:01.000 --> 58:03.000
if you have something flammable.

58:03.000 --> 58:04.000
I don't know.

58:04.000 --> 58:08.000
Obviously they're not telling you the details on what he was planning to do for obvious reasons,

58:08.000 --> 58:14.000
but I still find it shocking that he was able to hide firecrackers undetected.

58:14.000 --> 58:17.000
You know.

58:17.000 --> 58:20.000
It sucks.

58:20.000 --> 58:21.000
I don't know what else to say.

58:21.000 --> 58:22.000
It sucks.

58:22.000 --> 58:23.000
Kick dirt mound.

58:23.000 --> 58:26.000
Wah.

58:26.000 --> 58:28.000
This is a little less suck, although I don't know.

58:28.000 --> 58:30.000
We'll see when the first issue comes out.

58:30.000 --> 58:33.000
Electronic Gaming Monthly is coming back.

58:33.000 --> 58:36.000
You might remember the plug was pulled on Electronic Gaming Monthly a few months ago

58:36.000 --> 58:38.000
because, you know, the recession, etc., etc.

58:38.000 --> 58:42.000
People don't read video game magazines because of the internet, etc., etc.

58:42.000 --> 58:44.000
But Electronic Gaming Monthly apparently is coming back.

58:44.000 --> 58:47.000
It's going to be coming back with an April issue that's released in March

58:47.000 --> 58:51.000
because, you know, they come out a month before the actual date on the magazine.

58:51.000 --> 58:53.000
And that's when it's coming out.

58:53.000 --> 58:57.000
There's a press release that came out that announced that it will be coming out

58:57.000 --> 59:01.000
and there's also going to be an eGMI, the digital magazine.

59:01.000 --> 59:05.000
I guess there's a special code that will be in the issue that allows you to access

59:05.000 --> 59:10.000
the digital components for exclusive article extensions and original content.

59:10.000 --> 59:14.000
So trying to get you to buy the, you know, try to tie it into the internet.

59:14.000 --> 59:18.000
Yeah, if it's anything like Game Informer does, it's kind of useless.

59:18.000 --> 59:20.000
And here's my, you know, devil's advocate to this.

59:20.000 --> 59:22.000
I applaud them for trying to do something different,

59:22.000 --> 59:26.000
but at the same time this exclusive digital content will be reprinted

59:26.000 --> 59:29.000
and copy-pasted somewhere else within milliseconds.

59:29.000 --> 59:32.000
I mean, this is the age of the internet.

59:32.000 --> 59:37.000
You're not going to put a bombshell news thing in there

59:37.000 --> 59:40.000
and expect it not to get republished somewhere else, you know what I mean?

59:40.000 --> 59:41.000
Yeah.

59:41.000 --> 59:43.000
A little silly, but I don't know.

59:43.000 --> 59:45.000
Features and things I suppose are a little harder to get.

59:45.000 --> 59:48.000
Anyone that doesn't have a subscription to Game Informer

59:48.000 --> 59:52.000
and pretty much if you shop at GameStop and you have one of their cards,

59:52.000 --> 59:56.000
you have a subscription because you get it for free when you get their stupid card.

59:56.000 --> 01:00:00.000
Anyways, I mean, the online portion of it is kind of useless.

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:04.000
I mean, they have some additional screenshots usually

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:10.000
or, you know, some articles or interviews or whatever, like extended interviews.

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:14.000
But it's nothing really like, oh my god, that's so awesome, you know, that they have on there.

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:20.000
It's not like Core or something like that where you get, you know, games or something like that.

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:22.000
I miss the old magazines with demo discs.

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:25.000
Of course, nowadays, you know, I used to subscribe to the Xbox magazine

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:28.000
because you used to get some demos that weren't available on Live,

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:31.000
but now they put out demos that are already available on Live.

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:33.000
It's like, why the fuck do I even bother?

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:36.000
I'm not going to buy your stupid magazine with a demo disc.

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:37.000
Because maybe you're still on dial-up.

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:41.000
You know, we've got a whole box full of old demo discs.

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:44.000
Now occasionally, though, they did have some free download content in there, which is kind of cool.

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:47.000
They had a few Oblivion expansions and stuff like that were free.

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:49.000
So that's kind of cool. That's a little bit of a value.

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:54.000
But, you know, I kind of miss the days like, well, you know, I used to buy PC Gamer too.

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:56.000
They used to have a whole bunch of shareware and free shit on there.

01:00:56.000 --> 01:01:02.000
Well, wouldn't it now just be type in the code and get a demo on PSN or Xbox Live?

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:03.000
Yeah, they could do that.

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:06.000
Why bother with the cost of discs now? It's all digital.

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:10.000
But then again, you could just read it. They can't do that, though, because...

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:12.000
Well, I mean, they've done it in the past, so with...

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:14.000
I mean, take it a step further. What is CORE?

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:18.000
CORE magazine on PlayStation Network is basically just that. It's the demos and everything.

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:21.000
Oh, but the magazine's online too. I mean...

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:25.000
Yeah. The era of print is kind of going away.

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:27.000
Well, Electronic Human Monthly is going to try to make it last.

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:32.000
I mean, at the same time, you don't bring your PS3 onto the john with you,

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:36.000
so magazines will always at least serve a purpose there.

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:40.000
So if you want to pick up your bathroom reader of Electronic Gaming Monthly,

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:49.000
it will feature stuff by Dan, Shu, Su, Sean Baby is part of the crew as well, and so on and so on.

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:51.000
A lot of names you might recognize from previous years.

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:54.000
Oh, he did the comic, the Su and Sean comic.

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:56.000
I used to read those, like, all the time.

01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:59.000
And they had a webcomic, I think, for a little while too.

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:04.000
Well, if you want to check that out, it will be coming out soon, so check out the newsstands.

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:06.000
Well, here's some other stuff you can spend your money on.

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:07.000
What's that?

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:12.000
Sackboy plushies. They are now on Amazon.

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:17.000
You can get a Sackboy and a Sackgirl for 20 bucks.

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:23.000
Ooh. But they won't have any until December 30th. Ooh.

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:27.000
I didn't like the look of the Sackgirl on there.

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:31.000
No, the Sackgirl looks stupid, but the Sackboy's pretty cute.

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:36.000
Yeah, because, I mean, the Sackboy is the one that's actually on the front cover, so that's kind of cool.

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:41.000
Yeah, I like, I think, and besides that, you know, can't she wear something other than pink?

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:43.000
I don't know. I guess not.

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:45.000
Sackboy's adorable.

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:51.000
Well, Team Fortress 2, if you don't have enough friends to play the game with you, Valve has the answer for you.

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:54.000
They are beta testing right now AI opponents.

01:02:54.000 --> 01:03:04.000
Yes, you will be able to use some pretty intelligent bots as your opponents to fill in, you know, gaps that you may have on your team.

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:13.000
And apparently, I believe this is available now, and they do have some stuff you use in the console,

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:20.000
including ways to add people to there or remove AI players and whatnot.

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:28.000
But apparently they're pretty cool, and they actually, I don't know, are good replacements for people that may not be there.

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:37.000
And I think they've done this in, like, Counter-Strike and stuff like that, so I wouldn't see why they wouldn't do it here.

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:38.000
I don't know.

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:43.000
Something to keep the game going with lots of original stuff, I suppose, you know?

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:47.000
I'd like an offline version of Team Fortress 2 with bots. That'd be pretty fun.

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:49.000
Some people don't like to play online with real people.

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:50.000
I hate real people.

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:53.000
Real people can sometimes be a pain in the ass, you know?

01:03:53.000 --> 01:04:01.000
Unless we're playing a Grand Theft Auto, which, by the way, I remember back in the day, listeners complaining that they couldn't play Grand Theft Auto with me.

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:08.000
Okay, I've been playing ranked games now almost every day. None of our listeners are playing.

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:10.000
What's up with that?

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:19.000
It's free to play now. We play 10 AM and 3 PM Pacific around there within probably about half an hour or so.

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:24.000
And just a ranked deathmatch in the Ballad of Gay Tony.

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:31.000
And feel free to join our game because we want to give out your gamertag to LokiOLR.

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:33.000
All one word.

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:40.000
Feel free. You can't really be invited into the game. You just have to join a ranked game.

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:44.000
Trust me, there's hardly anyone playing right now. It's really easy to join the game.

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:51.000
So you can just see if I'm online, most likely playing Grand Theft Auto, join the game, and prepare to get your ass kicked.

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:53.000
Nice. It's so modest.

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:57.000
Alright, Loki's throwing down the gauntlet here on OLR. Check it out.

01:04:57.000 --> 01:05:01.000
Alright, one more story for you guys, then we're going to get to the classic game of the week.

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:06.000
And this has to do with, remember last week it came up that the PSP 4000 was on its way out.

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:18.000
This coming from an advertisement that ran in a magazine that showed that this upcoming, I think, LittleBigPlanet thing was going to work on PSP 1000, 2000, 3000, the GO, and the OMG, what is this PSP 4000?

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:24.000
Well, by the way, they've come out and said, of course, deny, deny, deny.

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:32.000
It's come out, apparently, that the Sony PSP 4000 mention was a mistake on their part.

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:36.000
There is no new model of the PSP under construction.

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:38.000
Uh huh, sure, whatever you say, dude.

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:54.000
Yes, just like they didn't have an icon or whatever like that that was also available on Sony's website as well that someone found by changing the file name or whatever of the PSP 3000 icon on there.

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:56.000
The 4000, oh look, it shows up.

01:05:56.000 --> 01:06:10.000
Also, Sony came out and said, oh yeah, this is not true, and then the company that put out the ad said, oh yeah, this is not true, but come on, if they were really going to put it out, and this company leaked it out, wouldn't they be telling the company, deny everything!

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:19.000
Yeah, I know, the response coming here is like, I don't know, I don't know what you're talking about, crazy people, 4000!

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:24.000
Whether they do or not, let me put it this way, it's not going to be significant either way, so...

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:31.000
Alright, Sony, you're not coming out with a 4000, I will pretend to be surprised when you announce the 4000.

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:33.000
Just like with the Go.

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:39.000
We're not doing a UMD Listio PSP with a sliding screen, that's preposterous!

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:42.000
Oh, by the way, the PSP Go is coming out now.

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:45.000
Here comes E3, lol gotcha!

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:49.000
Oh, 4000, you didn't see that one coming, no!

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:53.000
I think they should name it the 4001 just to spite everybody.

01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:57.000
Sony, if you're listening, seriously, that is how you could get the last laugh.

01:06:57.000 --> 01:07:01.000
Because we all know you're doing it now, just suck it up.

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:04.000
Name it the PSP 4001.

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:07.000
And lol.

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:12.000
Alright, we're going to take some time here on the show to respect the classics.

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:18.000
It is time for the very last classic game of the week of the decade.

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:21.000
No, this segment will be back in 2010, of course it will.

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:27.000
But this is a chance for Dark Soccer to dig through the gaming archives and pick a game from Gaming gesture here that she says,

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:33.000
Damn it, you ungrateful kids these days in your newfangled 360s and PS3s,

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:37.000
you need to go play the games we used to play back in my day.

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:39.000
And then she'll run over you with her walker, right?

01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:43.000
I went, no, I went for Epic Old School Awesome.

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:46.000
Alright, so what is the Epic Old School Awesome video game of the week?

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:50.000
The video game of the week is Salamander.

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:52.000
I'm pretty sure I haven't done Salamander yet.

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:53.000
I don't think you have either.

01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:54.000
Which is a shame.

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:56.000
Well, then here is a little clip of Salamander.

01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:57.000
Let's listen to the intro.

01:07:57.000 --> 01:08:06.000
Pick it up for multiple, multiple, multiple, multiple, multiple.

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:11.000
Pick it up for a fourth, pick it up for Ripple Waker.

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:12.000
Which is the arcade version.

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:14.000
Now what is this Dark Soccer?

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:16.000
This is just Life Force, right?

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:21.000
Actually, yes, Life Force is the name it came out with in North America.

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:26.000
So it's a spinoff from the Gradia series.

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:34.000
And it actually switches between horizontal and vertically scrolling areas.

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:36.000
So you've got kind of a little bit of both.

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:41.000
It also has a more simplified power-up system, too.

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:44.000
And you can play two-player co-op, which is great.

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:47.000
And that's in all of the stages, by the way.

01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:54.000
So Player 1 is the Vic Viper, and Player 2 is the Lord British.

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:57.000
And actually, did you know that there's a Salamander anime?

01:08:57.000 --> 01:08:59.000
Wait, they really called one of the ships the Lord British?

01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:00.000
Yeah.

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:02.000
Like the same guy who did Ultima Lord British?

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:05.000
I don't know.

01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:09.000
Yeah, because when I hear Lord British, I think it's the dude who did Ultima back in the day.

01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:15.000
At any rate, well, you've got the Vic Viper and Lord British.

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:21.000
And you play through six stages, and like I said, it alternates between horizontal and vertical.

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:30.000
You can actually continue from where you left off upon death instead of the checkpoint version that Gradius has.

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:35.000
You do not have any continues in Salamander's mode when you play single,

01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:41.000
but you have two continues in two-player mode, though you can actually change it in the settings.

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:44.000
You also have different power-ups, like I said.

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:54.000
And you just pick up the capsule that you want of the power-up instead of selecting it like you do in Gradius.

01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:57.000
You know, how you can pick a double or let them save up.

01:09:57.000 --> 01:10:01.000
By the way, this is the most epic beating of this boss ever.

01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:06.000
I was going to say, whoever's doing this playthrough here off this YouTube, it's user Succula.

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:11.000
S-U-C-C-U-L-L-A is the YouTuber we're looking at here in the studio right now where the music's coming from.

01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:16.000
Epic! This person knows what the fuck they're doing with this game. They know where it's at.

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:20.000
Well, on top of that, just like any of the Gradius games, especially with the bosses,

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:29.000
there are little hidey places that you can go to and ways to lure the boss or whatever to where you need it to be.

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:35.000
And if I'm right, I think this is a one-playthrough beating of this game, which is really freaking difficult.

01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:38.000
I love the laser. That was my favorite weapon.

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:40.000
I just freaking love Life Force on the NES.

01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:44.000
I mean, I realize it has its roots different places, but I remember it as Life Force on the NES.

01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:46.000
Well, I've got it.

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:47.000
Rob, if you want to play it?

01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:50.000
Oh yeah, I know. I remember seeing it in the vault.

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:59.000
I just kind of, you know, I like the voice in this one, but I miss the double, you know, option and all that.

01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:02.000
Or speed up, you know, but anyway.

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:10.000
So you've got different backgrounds, you have star fields, you've got all kinds of different stuff.

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:19.000
There's actually some big differences between the Japanese version and the European version and Life Force.

01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:31.000
The Japanese and European versions are pretty much the same except the American version changes the plot to the game by having some opening text

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:38.000
where you're actually going inside a giant alien life form to fight off bacteria.

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:46.000
And so the star fields from Salamander were actually changed to kind of a web background so that it looks more organic.

01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:48.000
I'm sure you remember that, Rob, don't you?

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:49.000
Yes.

01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:58.000
Power ups have different names. You have speed up becoming hyperspeed, missile becoming struck to missile, the ripple laser becoming pulse laser, and force field becoming shield.

01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:00.000
OMG, I love the fire level.

01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:01.000
Yeah.

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:05.000
Sorry, they're in stage three right now on their epic play through and oof, I love the fire level.

01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:09.000
There should be a link to level four, and actually level four, Rob, I wish you would have placed at the beginning of that.

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:10.000
There should be this Saturn note.

01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:13.000
Sure, you want to skip ahead a little bit here? We'll get to the fourth one.

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:17.000
Yeah, but this music you'll recognize from B-Mania.

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:26.000
Okay.

01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:29.000
That music right now was in the song under B-crush music.

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:30.000
Nice.

01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:35.000
And actually stage four has my favorite music in the game.

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:56.000
But some other differences, your power ups were modified a little bit to where you have the same for life force, the Japanese life force, you actually had the same power up as Gradius.

01:12:56.000 --> 01:13:09.000
Some music was changed. You can, however, get the original Japanese version and the enhanced life force with the salamander deluxe pack that came out for PlayStation and Saturn and salamander portable on PSP.

01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:19.000
So yeah, we have the NES version, which actually came out in 87.

01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:29.000
It actually, though, just took bits from salamander and life force to kind of make it a bit of a new concept in the game.

01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:40.000
It actually, we got the port for the NES, and it's exactly the same, except it doesn't have multiple endings like the Japanese one does, and it's just called life force.

01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:46.000
All of these use the Konami code, and the NES version is out on the virtual console.

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:52.000
500 Wii points, go get it. There's an MSX version that's pretty different.

01:13:52.000 --> 01:14:04.000
You have different pilots for each of the ships, which if I do remember correctly, I think that it was from the MSX version that the anime was based off of.

01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:08.000
It's been a long time since I've watched the anime. We've got it on DVD somewhere.

01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:16.000
There's also a PC Engine version. You actually have checkpoints in this one, faster anime animations.

01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:20.000
Actually, they improved some of the music from the arcade version.

01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:27.000
Ocean Software brought it out for the Spectrum Commodore in Amstrad in 1988.

01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:37.000
But the Commodore 64 version, Rob, you may be particularly happy to find out, was pretty much considered one of the best of the PC ports.

01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:41.000
Of course, like I said, it came out on the PlayStation and Saturn.

01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:47.000
We got the Salamander Deluxe Pack, and also included with that was Salamander 2.

01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:50.000
So that was Salamander, Life Force, and Salamander 2.

01:14:50.000 --> 01:15:00.000
PSP, we got Salamander Portable, which had actually a few other kind of rare games in it.

01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:09.000
It had Salamander, Life Force, Salamander 2, Zexix, I think that's what it's called? Zexix, Zexis? X-E-X-E-X?

01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:10.000
Yeah, yeah.

01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:11.000
It's a game I haven't played in a long time.

01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:17.000
And the MSX version of Gradius 2, which came out, I think, as Nemesis 2.

01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:22.000
Which has nothing to do with the arcade Gradius 2.

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:26.000
And for the record, Gradius 2 on PC Engine? Excellent.

01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:30.000
Anyway, so yeah, here's actually the thing about the anime in here.

01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:38.000
There was an OAV, and it had to do with, it had the different characters in it.

01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:45.000
There was a character named Stephanie, and Lord British's ship was actually named after a character called Lord British.

01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:48.000
So, it was Lord British's space destroyer.

01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:51.000
I think it does have to do with the guy behind Ultima.

01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:53.000
At least some of the folks in chat are indicating too.

01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:56.000
That's really interesting, because he had nothing to do with Konami, I thought.

01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:57.000
Yeah.

01:15:57.000 --> 01:16:00.000
Well, there's also a couple good soundtracks too.

01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:02.000
There's a Salamander arcade soundtrack.

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:09.000
There is the original Sound of Salamander, and Salamander again, Konami Kukeha Club.

01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:12.000
Which, you know, they did a few games from that series.

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:14.000
I mean, a few soundtracks from that series.

01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:15.000
So there you go.

01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:17.000
Yummy.

01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:20.000
Lots of Salamander-y things.

01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:24.000
And also, I freaking love the cover of the soundtrack.

01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:26.000
I mean, look at that and tell me that's not awesome.

01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:28.000
I'm gonna link it in chatroom.

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:31.000
Yes, it's like a big demon face thing.

01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:32.000
Kinda scary, actually, a little bit.

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:34.000
It's like an evil snake.

01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:35.000
Alright.

01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:37.000
Which really has nothing to do with the Salamander, I guess.

01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:41.000
Other than being, you know, reptiles, I guess, maybe?

01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:44.000
Alright, well there it is, your classic game of the week, Salamander.

01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:49.000
Which is available on a variety of different systems, but if you want to play the original, go play the arcade version.

01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:52.000
You can find it if you know where to look.

01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:55.000
Alright, we're gonna take a quick break, but we'll be back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:56.000
We're not done yet.

01:16:56.000 --> 01:16:57.000
In fact, we're gonna be back.

01:16:57.000 --> 01:16:58.000
We still have some rapid-fire news.

01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:00.000
Your Twitter topics.

01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:04.000
And then we're gonna take a break from the news tonight and talk a little bit about what's happened this year.

01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:07.000
Talk about our picks for game of the year.

01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:08.000
And donuts.

01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:10.000
And you wanna talk about donuts?

01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:11.000
I just want one.

01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:12.000
I want a donut, too.

01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:13.000
I also want a pony.

01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:15.000
Let's make dang, let's make dang, I have a pony, Rob.

01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:16.000
Did I tell you that?

01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:18.000
Okay, I have to share this.

01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:19.000
Alright, yes.

01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:23.000
For our team builder, we did our annual present exchange.

01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:27.000
And we were given these little pieces of paper that says, write down what you want.

01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:30.000
So I'm like, you know, so that whoever gets our name doesn't buy us crap.

01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:35.000
And I was like, okay, I want an Amazon gift card, or this gift card, or this gift card, or a pony.

01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:39.000
So someone, the person who got me, got me a toy pony.

01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:41.000
That's awesome.

01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:43.000
And then a gift card to Barnes & Noble, so.

01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:44.000
Nice.

01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:45.000
But I finally got my pony.

01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:47.000
That means I have to stop asking for one at restaurants.

01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:49.000
When they say, what can I get you tonight?

01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:50.000
I need a pony.

01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:51.000
Do you need anything else?

01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:53.000
Yeah, I'd like a pony, please.

01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:57.000
I'm going to have to stick with either the llama or the pygmy goat.

01:17:57.000 --> 01:17:59.000
Alright, we're going to take a quick break, guys.

01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:05.000
We'll be back with more of Orange Lounge Radio in the year and the decade in review in just a few minutes.

01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:16.000
And welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio on this Sunday night, December the 27th of 2009,

01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:20.000
where we're taping the 350th episode of our show.

01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:26.000
And, yes, it's the very last Orange Lounge Radio of the decade, but we'll be back next week, as always, to do it all again.

01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:30.000
And since it is the last OLR of the decade and it's been a little bit of a slow news week,

01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:36.000
we're going to take some time to reflect on our favorite games of the year and of the decade.

01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:42.000
But, meanwhile, we do have a few other news stories we want to get to real quick in a segment we call the Rapid Fire News.

01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:44.000
And, of course, we'll get to your Twitter topics, too.

01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:47.000
If you haven't sent us your tweets yet, hurry up and do that, because we're going to get to those very soon,

01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:50.000
as soon as we get out our Rapid Fire News. So, Loki.

01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:59.000
Yes. Well, if you're looking for something to do shortly after the new year, you can perhaps join the MAG beta,

01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:06.000
which was previously not available to everybody, but starting January 4th will be.

01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:11.000
And you will be able to download it on the PlayStation Network.

01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:16.000
Existing beta members will be able to update their files to prepare for the upcoming trial,

01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:21.000
which means that you shouldn't delete any of your MAG data if you are already in the beta.

01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:29.000
And, apparently, the beta is pretty short, though. It is only lasting a week until, well, slightly under a week, until January 10th.

01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:38.000
But you will be able to play 64-player sabotage matches and also 256-player domination matches.

01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:44.000
So, that's kind of neat. And then, of course, the end of the game will be coming out shortly after that.

01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:47.000
So, on the 26th.

01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:54.000
Also, on the PlayStation Network will be coming Holy Invasion of Privacy Bad Man 2.

01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:59.000
And what's kind of cool about it, as well, is that you will not only be able to get the sequel,

01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:03.000
but the first game will be included with it for free.

01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:08.000
And that is, of course, if you get it via the PlayStation Network.

01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:15.000
No word, though, if, when they decide to put this out as an actual UMD, if the original game will appear on there, as well.

01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:23.000
But, at least right now, is kind of a nice bonus for, I guess, people who may own, like, the PSP Go, and that's their only option.

01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:25.000
So, that's kind of neat.

01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:30.000
And then, finally, in un-Sony PlayStation News,

01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:36.000
Crackdown 2 is scheduled to be coming out the first half of 2010, which makes me all sorts of happy.

01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:44.000
And no word exactly yet when it's going to be coming, but apparently it was revealed on Major Nelson's weekly podcast

01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:56.000
that Xbox's head, Aaron Greenberg, apparently is saying that Mass Effect 2, Splinter Cell Conviction, and Alan Wake,

01:20:56.000 --> 01:21:02.000
and apparently also Crackdown 2 are scheduled for the first part of the year.

01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:06.000
So, I guess Alan Wake isn't coming out later in the year like I had thought.

01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:09.000
Probably second quarter, if I'd guess correctly.

01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:12.000
Alright, well, some other games coming out before too long.

01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:16.000
Resonance of Fate, some folks might be interested in this, is by TriAce.

01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:22.000
This is already available as a demo on the Japanese PlayStation Network or the Japanese Xbox 360.

01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:26.000
So, if you have a Japanese PSN account or you have a way of getting onto the...

01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:30.000
I guess the Xbox is a little better now at blocking the non-Japanese stuff, but...

01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:31.000
Eh, not very good at that.

01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:34.000
Whatever you can do to get in there, you can do that to download that demo.

01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:38.000
If you haven't already heard about this game, it's coming out from SEGA is publishing it.

01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:41.000
It's kind of like a gunplay style RPG.

01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:49.000
So, check that out, Resonance of Fate, now available in Japan or for those of you crafty folks over in other countries who know how to get in anyway.

01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:53.000
LoL, Eye of Judgment, yes, it's coming out on the PSP.

01:21:53.000 --> 01:22:00.000
But, no camera, no cards, and apparently, I'm not sure the UMD is really going to be there either.

01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:03.000
Legends is just going to be on the PlayStation Store.

01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:05.000
It's going to be there in the spring of 2010.

01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:09.000
It'll have 300 digital cards, 30 that are unique on the PSP.

01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:11.000
No UMD release expected at this time.

01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:13.000
It's only going to be a digital download.

01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:18.000
That doesn't mean it's only playable on the go, because remember, if you have a big enough memory card on the 3000...

01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:20.000
That's all you need.

01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:22.000
Is that included in the bet?

01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:24.000
Ooh, good question.

01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:28.000
No, and the reason why is because it's not as ridiculous as Eye of Judgment.

01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:32.000
Whereas this, you know, is an actual game that can be played like a traditional game.

01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:37.000
It's not something that's, you know, a card game with this extra camera crap that's added on top of it.

01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:39.000
I will give Loki that. I mean, let's face it.

01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:45.000
Part of what made the first game so preposterous was the fact that, you know, you're playing this card game with a camera, and I think that's why he took the bet in the first place.

01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:48.000
PSP's deleting all that weird shit out.

01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:59.000
Yeah, it's actually a game. It'd be almost like a translation of a Magic the Gathering game, whereas, you know, Eye of Judgment, I can imagine, would be played without the camera and all that extra crap.

01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:04.000
Fair enough, guys. Let's just face it. Loki's never going to lose that bet. At least not in this decade.

01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:07.000
It's never going to happen, period. They've stopped making the game.

01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:09.000
Alright.

01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:13.000
Silent Night is the name of a new expansion that came out on Quake Live this week.

01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:17.000
And, as you can imagine, it makes everybody fit for the holidays.

01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:21.000
Like, I guess if you want to shoot Santa Claus or one of his little helpers, you can kind of do that there.

01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:28.000
It's going to be there for two weeks, and it's a remake of a Team Arena Distance Screams. They're now calling it Silent Night.

01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:33.000
So, don't expect any new weapons or any significant changes to gameplay.

01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:40.000
It's just like, you know, La La La, Winter Wonderland, etc., etc., candy canes and so forth for you to blow your friends away to.

01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:42.000
Have fun with that.

01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:44.000
Dark Soccer, what do you got for us?

01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:46.000
Some stuff.

01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:48.000
Stuff like and such as?

01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:54.000
Well, Sega's having like a big sale in their Wii Shop channel.

01:23:54.000 --> 01:24:03.000
You should have some of the games like Sonic 1, 2, 3, Gunstar Heroes, Streets of Rage 2, PLPO2.

01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:07.000
Basically, they're going to be five bucks until January 6th.

01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:12.000
So, each of them are three dollars less than usual, and I think they just want to make some money.

01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:15.000
So, go buy them.

01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:25.000
And as far as other stuff going on, there is a New Year's theme for free on Xbox Live, which it's pretty colorful.

01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:31.000
Dan was using it for a little while. It has a big ball on top of the building. Ooh.

01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:44.000
Also, they have some other things to go with the New Year that's supposed to, you have to pay for them, like the 2010 Avatar glasses.

01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:50.000
And there's also the Deal of the Day stuff, like I believe it was the other day, it was Worms 2.

01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:52.000
Some other stuff.

01:24:52.000 --> 01:25:02.000
And then, last but not least, and actually this is I think the best news of all, is there is a country pack for Rock Band,

01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:08.000
but who cares about the country crap because there's also a Paul McCartney set in there as well.

01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:17.000
So, that's actually, it's actually December 29th is the country pack, which Alan Jackson's Good Time,

01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:24.000
Cross Canadian Ragweed, Cry Lonely, Jason, Aldi and She's Country, Keith Urban, I Told You So.

01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:27.000
That seems to be like the only good thing in the whole packet.

01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:32.000
Kenny Rogers, The Gambler, okay, maybe Kenny Rogers, classic.

01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:36.000
Martina McBride, this one's for the girls, Shania Twain, Any Man of Mine, blah, blah, blah.

01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:42.000
But the Paul McCartney pack is going to be out on January 5th or January 7th for PS3 owners.

01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:51.000
Haha, we'll get it first, Xbox, Xbox. You also get, for that set you get Band on the Run, the live, actually all these are live versions.

01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:55.000
This is from the Paul McCartney New York City concert.

01:25:55.000 --> 01:25:59.000
But there's Band on the Run, Jet, and Sing the Changes.

01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:09.000
All of those are going to be 160, sorry, Xbox points or 200 Wii points each.

01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:17.000
And these are actually, there's no telling if they're going to be available for Lego Rock Band.

01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:19.000
Alright.

01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:23.000
I can't wait until January 5th.

01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:27.000
We'll start off the year with a bang, or a few guitar strums, whatever the case may be.

01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:29.000
Let's get into some Twitter topics.

01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:35.000
We've been taking some of your submissions over Twitter at Twitter.com slash O-L-R for some things we might have missed so far in the show.

01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:40.000
And some random asked questions such as this first one from Blue Swim who tweets us,

01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:48.000
If you could bring only one celebrity who died during the O's decade back to life, who would it be and why?

01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:56.000
He continues on to tweet, I'd bring Heath Ledger back to life so he could reprise his role as the Joker in the new Batman movies again.

01:26:56.000 --> 01:27:05.000
Gosh, I don't know. To think all the way back throughout the entire decade of the O's, that's a long time.

01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:09.000
A lot of people die, death just kind of happens, so I'm not sure.

01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:12.000
If you could bring back only one celebrity, he specifically said a celebrity.

01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:15.000
Anybody that comes to mind for any of you?

01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:17.000
I honestly, I'm drawing a blank.

01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:19.000
I don't care.

01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:22.000
Yeah, it's kind of a weird thought.

01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:35.000
What if one of the celebrities that if they were suddenly back, if their very presence, alive, disrupted the entire time space continuum?

01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:37.000
Or if they got brought back as a zombie.

01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:43.000
No, Rob. Then we'd have to shoot them in the head and we couldn't remember them in a nice way.

01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:51.000
I would like to see, um, God, the name escapes me right now, a totally famous guy, the guy that was with the NRA, not from my cold dead hands.

01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:56.000
Charlton Heston, was that it? I'd like to see him reanimated as a zombie. I think that's the celebrity from the O's.

01:27:56.000 --> 01:28:01.000
I want to see Brittany Whatcherfuck come back as a zombie so we can shoot her.

01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:04.000
Rude, rude, rude.

01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:15.000
You know, this is my whole thing. I understand mourning the loss of, like, someone's contribution, but you didn't know the person, you know?

01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:19.000
Very good suggestion from chat. We have a couple people yelling out, Phil Hartman.

01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:22.000
That was a very tragic thing that happened.

01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:29.000
This is my whole thing. When people die, it's typically when they're supposed to.

01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:37.000
Even if it might seem stupid, it's just, it happens when it happens, so I don't see any point in wishing for something that's not going to happen.

01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:43.000
And since then, I really don't want to see anyone reanimated. I mean, just the whole zombie thing totally makes me want to puke.

01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:45.000
Loki, was there something smartass you wanted to add?

01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:50.000
No, I just had to see when someone died, so just checking real quick.

01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:51.000
Dammit!

01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:55.000
That was in 94. No John Candy, unfortunately.

01:28:55.000 --> 01:29:02.000
I guess I'm going to have to go with my original thought, which was Michael Jackson, because I'd like to see him do his actual comeback.

01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:07.000
And, you know, all sorts of fun that would be involved with that.

01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:15.000
Alright, let's see. SSJ100Matt sent us this on Twitter, which is a link to a story.

01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:17.000
Police followed an Xbox trail...

01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:20.000
Oh, no, no, no, no, no! I take that back. I renege that.

01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:23.000
I would like to see, um...

01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:25.000
Oh, god, what's his name?

01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:33.000
The chatroom is correcting themselves, by the way. Phil Hartman died in 98.

01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:37.000
Yeah, not Phil Hartman.

01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:41.000
The other guy, the other pitchman.

01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:42.000
Billy Mays.

01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:44.000
Hi, Billy Mays here.

01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:45.000
As a zombie.

01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:47.000
No, not as a zombie.

01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:51.000
Did you see that episode of South Park? Brilliant, that show.

01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:54.000
Anyhow, back to SSJ100Matt's tweet, thank you very much.

01:29:54.000 --> 01:30:01.000
Sent us to a story from Lohud.com talking about police following an Xbox trail.

01:30:01.000 --> 01:30:06.000
I guess because this guy in the Bronx was playing with a stolen Xbox 360 game system,

01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:12.000
it led them to a stash of stolen property, 200 car break-ins, and a couple of burglaries.

01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:15.000
They were very excited to recover all this.

01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:18.000
They went to... Oh, I love when they give the address in the story.

01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:24.000
It was 4064 Laconia Avenue in the Bronx is where all this stuff was hiding, apparently.

01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:30.000
They got a search warrant. They traced through Microsoft and the ISP where this stolen Xbox was being played from,

01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:35.000
and it led them to a GPS system, laptop computers, and all this stuff.

01:30:35.000 --> 01:30:43.000
It looks like all this stuff was retrieved from 22-year-old Jeremiah Gilliam's bedroom.

01:30:43.000 --> 01:30:47.000
To Jeremiah Gilliam, we say, uh-huh.

01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:49.000
Next time, don't be stupid.

01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:55.000
Stealing things is pretty stupid in the first place, but then when you go and play with the stolen goods on the internet,

01:30:55.000 --> 01:30:58.000
that just makes you stupid or stupid.

01:30:58.000 --> 01:31:01.000
But let's face it, you're pretty stupid when you're stealing shit in the first place.

01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:02.000
That makes someone extra stupid.

01:31:02.000 --> 01:31:06.000
He probably wouldn't think that they would be tracking the system,

01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:12.000
and it's almost likely that they wouldn't know what the system serial number and that kind of stuff was,

01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:16.000
but apparently they were able to track that via history and stuff like that.

01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:20.000
Dedication to them for trying to get it back to the Xbox 360.

01:31:20.000 --> 01:31:26.000
We got a link from DJ Rama S on Twitter. He's linking us to another local New York thing.

01:31:26.000 --> 01:31:29.000
This is coming from Gizmodo, which is kind of interesting.

01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:33.000
It has to do with the iPhone, which some would argue is pretty much a gaming device in this day and age.

01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:40.000
Apparently, the iPhone is not purchasable on AT&T's website if you use a New York City zip code,

01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:46.000
because according to a rep at, I guess, online, New York is not ready for the iPhone.

01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:50.000
You've heard about all these types of complaints where in New York City they can't handle the iPhone bandwidth.

01:31:50.000 --> 01:31:55.000
Calls are getting dropped left and right and all this crazy stuff, so yikes.

01:31:55.000 --> 01:32:03.000
But their 3G is better. Their commercials say so. Am I to believe that Luke Wilson is lying to me?

01:32:03.000 --> 01:32:12.000
I can't handle that. That's shocking that they would misrepresent themselves like that.

01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:18.000
Just to point out, though, Gizmodo kind of continues to say that, hey, San Francisco also has a lot of problems,

01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:23.000
and you can still get an iPhone in San Francisco, so why New York is being singled out, who knows.

01:32:23.000 --> 01:32:27.000
I think it's probably just some type of weird, creepy bug.

01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:32.000
I don't think AT&T is going to acknowledge that this has any weight to it whatsoever.

01:32:32.000 --> 01:32:35.000
But apparently, also, Tigerclaw wants to add in our chat room.

01:32:35.000 --> 01:32:42.000
You can still go into a phone and get a, or, sorry, still go into a phone, still go into a store and get the phone that way.

01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:45.000
A little strange.

01:32:45.000 --> 01:32:49.000
Anyhow, also going to some other news stories that were submitted.

01:32:49.000 --> 01:32:59.000
Ray Ayanami sends us this link to Ketsuie, was announced for the Japanese Xbox 360s at what's called the Cave Festival.

01:32:59.000 --> 01:33:01.000
So this is a shooting game.

01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:08.000
Ketsuie Kizuna Jigoku Tachi Extra is coming out on the 360.

01:33:08.000 --> 01:33:16.000
That'll cost you about $50, and it's another shmup that's coming to the Xbox 360, which has been getting a lot of those.

01:33:16.000 --> 01:33:21.000
But you can see some screenshots online at this shmups.system11.org web forum,

01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:27.000
where they actually show people playing at Akihabara at the Cave Festival this new game.

01:33:27.000 --> 01:33:30.000
And there's even some footage on the internets, but there's a lot of background noise.

01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:32.000
I don't want to play that for you right now.

01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:37.000
A couple stories coming to us from Tigerclaw305, who is sending us some stories about, let's see,

01:33:37.000 --> 01:33:43.000
Timegate has sued South Peak for royalties and breach of contract.

01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:47.000
Apparently this is the folks who developed Section 8, Timegate Studios.

01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:50.000
They have sued South Peak because of a breach of contract.

01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:59.000
Apparently the publisher is withholding royalty payments and violates the deal with a PS3 porting deal with a Russian company.

01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:01.000
My gosh.

01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:06.000
Let's see, Timegate wants compensatory damages.

01:34:06.000 --> 01:34:11.000
According to the report, South Peak says that because they got in 2008 Gamecock,

01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:16.000
it exempts it from some of the specifics of the original agreement.

01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:20.000
So yet more legal troubles.

01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:22.000
It'll be settled out of court. They always are.

01:34:22.000 --> 01:34:26.000
That's how those things go, yeah?

01:34:26.000 --> 01:34:28.000
That's what'll happen.

01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:35.000
Let's see, also what's also very interesting, the CEO of 3D Realms has teased a Duke Nukem resurgence.

01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:37.000
Oh God, here we go again.

01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:41.000
Apparently numerous Duke Nukem games are in various stages of development.

01:34:41.000 --> 01:34:44.000
Gosh, does that include Duke Nukem Forever?

01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:50.000
Funny that you should mention Duke Nukem because remember there was supposed to be the PSP and DS versions that were coming out in September.

01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:52.000
Oh, but those have been delayed.

01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:53.000
Just like Duke Nukem.

01:34:53.000 --> 01:35:00.000
Now I want to point out the CEO of 3D Realms did go out of his way to point out Duke Nukem Forever was not technically cancelled.

01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:06.000
Yes, we released the initial team, but that doesn't correlate to the demise of the project.

01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:07.000
Great.

01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:12.000
So this will be now what our third decade of Duke Nukem Forever rumors we're going to get into.

01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:15.000
Goody goody.

01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:18.000
Our good friend Marin Marvel has tweeted us and said,

01:35:18.000 --> 01:35:22.000
What do you guys think about the Blizzard Authenticator?

01:35:22.000 --> 01:35:25.000
I think it's a really good idea. I hate to say it.

01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:30.000
I had my account hacked and I will never undo the Authenticator because of it.

01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:33.000
Especially if you're an iPhone or iTouch user, it's free.

01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:39.000
And to get a free pet out of it, and even if you don't have an iPhone or an iTouch, it's like $6.50 for the keychain.

01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:47.000
Which, you know, considering they're also charging $10 for a pet, it's not a bad deal and it does keep your account relatively safe.

01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:54.000
I think it's unfortunate that Blizzard won't do more against these gold spammers and things, but unfortunately what they're doing,

01:35:54.000 --> 01:36:02.000
they're hacking a lot of American accounts and going into the games and rolling level one characters and doing all the shouts and so forth.

01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:03.000
How well does the app work?

01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:04.000
Huh?

01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:05.000
How well does the app work?

01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:10.000
Never had a problem with it. Pretty much all you do, you boot it up and it brings you up the code right away.

01:36:10.000 --> 01:36:12.000
But is that one that you have to pay for?

01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:13.000
No. It's a free app.

01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:14.000
Well then I'll just download it right now.

01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:18.000
Yeah, so I mean, honestly, if you have the iPhone or iTouch, there's no reason not to have it.

01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:24.000
Except for, you know, if you're away from that device a lot, like especially if you're an iTouch user, you're not always with your iTouch.

01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:27.000
But if you're with your iPhone, I mean, I have my phone with me pretty much everywhere I go.

01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:30.000
So, I see no reason not to have it there.

01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:38.000
But I just think it sucks that the burden is on me to prevent my account from getting hacked.

01:36:38.000 --> 01:36:44.000
I do think some of the burden, I mean, I am, you know, you can point and laugh at me all you want for having my account hacked.

01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:46.000
But I like to think I'm a pretty intelligent web user.

01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:49.000
I know the basics about phishing and websites.

01:36:49.000 --> 01:36:53.000
And I know, I do not to this day know how my account got hacked.

01:36:53.000 --> 01:36:57.000
And it kind of freaks me out because I hope they didn't get my email or other things as well.

01:36:57.000 --> 01:37:00.000
I just, I wish Blizzard would sue people.

01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:05.000
I wish they would just start blocking IPs from maybe regions that are in America.

01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:07.000
I mean, I hate to say it, but you know what?

01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:09.000
There is WoW localized for other regions.

01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:14.000
So, maybe it's time to start locking players out from certain regions.

01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:17.000
I hate to say it, but if that's the way we're going to prevent.

01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:21.000
But, you know, you can always IP spoof and all this other crazy stuff.

01:37:21.000 --> 01:37:24.000
But I just wish the burden wasn't on us.

01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:27.000
But hey, it's free.

01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:33.000
Lastly, one more question from Jazajazz on Twitter.

01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:36.000
Where do you think games are headed in the new year?

01:37:36.000 --> 01:37:40.000
Digital distribution is going to be huge in the next decade.

01:37:40.000 --> 01:37:45.000
I think a lot of these game stores are going to have to change their business model.

01:37:45.000 --> 01:37:47.000
Or there's a lot to lose in the coming decade.

01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:50.000
I think digital distribution is going to be huge in the upcoming next few years.

01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:52.000
I think that's where games are headed, online.

01:37:52.000 --> 01:37:55.000
Low-key Dark Soccer?

01:37:55.000 --> 01:37:58.000
I agree. Honestly, we've been seeing it happen more and more.

01:37:58.000 --> 01:38:01.000
Especially since Sony has been really adopting it.

01:38:01.000 --> 01:38:04.000
Yeah, probably more digital distribution.

01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:06.000
But I don't really think things are going to change too much.

01:38:06.000 --> 01:38:08.000
They're probably going to try to push 3D.

01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:10.000
Because that's the next big thing.

01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:15.000
And now with the two...

01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:18.000
I don't really see...

01:38:18.000 --> 01:38:20.000
Truly next-gen consoles.

01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:23.000
I found the Wii's kind of recycled hardware, if you ask me.

01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:28.000
But now they're coming out with their 3D controllers.

01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:31.000
So that's really going to be the pushes for 3D.

01:38:31.000 --> 01:38:36.000
And you're going to see almost a new console generation being formed from this.

01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:41.000
Yeah, I honestly would not expect to see all new consoles until 2013-14.

01:38:41.000 --> 01:38:43.000
I mean, it's going to be a ways out.

01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:45.000
Especially with these motion and stuff.

01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:46.000
Except for Nintendo.

01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:47.000
Unless...

01:38:47.000 --> 01:38:49.000
I think Nintendo will have something very soon.

01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:52.000
Unless this just flops and dies, you know.

01:38:52.000 --> 01:38:56.000
And I think from Nintendo, I don't think we're going to see anything really new.

01:38:56.000 --> 01:39:00.000
You know, it's probably just going to be an upgrade.

01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:04.000
I want to point out some comments from our chat room on some of those tweets.

01:39:04.000 --> 01:39:07.000
Misty wants to point out in our chat room, chat.orangelaunchreader.com

01:39:07.000 --> 01:39:08.000
Fuck that, Rob.

01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:11.000
I keep my eye touch with me all the damn time and in my pocket at work.

01:39:11.000 --> 01:39:14.000
Because due to some shit that happened around work last year,

01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:16.000
I'm paranoid about my eye touch getting jacked.

01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:17.000
Well, that's unfortunate.

01:39:17.000 --> 01:39:20.000
F you to those stupid people that caused you to be paranoid.

01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:23.000
I get some people, yes, they do have their eye touch with them all the time.

01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:26.000
But I also know some people that, you know, they only have it at home or at work.

01:39:26.000 --> 01:39:28.000
You know, they don't really carry it with them everywhere.

01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:29.000
So just...

01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:30.000
You know what your habits are.

01:39:30.000 --> 01:39:34.000
If you do have your eye touch with you all the time, then maybe the Blizzard thing is a good idea.

01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:36.000
SSJ100matt kind of jokes.

01:39:36.000 --> 01:39:38.000
I don't know if this is a joke or real.

01:39:38.000 --> 01:39:41.000
But Blizzard banning IPs in Korea is an act of war, Rob.

01:39:41.000 --> 01:39:47.000
I'm not saying ban Korea or whatever country you want to name from the games.

01:39:47.000 --> 01:39:54.000
But if you have a game that has US servers that's meant to be played by the US that's localized for the US,

01:39:54.000 --> 01:39:56.000
Korea gets their own version of the games.

01:39:56.000 --> 01:39:58.000
WoW's been localized for China.

01:39:58.000 --> 01:39:59.000
WoW's out another...

01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:01.000
You know what I mean?

01:40:01.000 --> 01:40:09.000
Unfortunately, if all the gold farming is coming from China, maybe it's time to put some restrictions down.

01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:14.000
I think they also need to place some restrictions on, you know, who can do these shouts and chat and so forth.

01:40:14.000 --> 01:40:17.000
Blizzard's done a really good job over the years, though.

01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:18.000
I mean, let's face it.

01:40:18.000 --> 01:40:22.000
Every time they evolve, the gold hackers and the gold farmers have to get a little smarter.

01:40:22.000 --> 01:40:26.000
I don't want to make it sound like Blizzard's done nothing because they really have done a lot.

01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:30.000
They've gotten smart about how they do trial accounts and a lot of the various aspects of WoW.

01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:36.000
It just sucks that they just won't play hardball and start suing the pants off of some of these people that exploit their game.

01:40:36.000 --> 01:40:38.000
You know what I mean?

01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:39.000
I just want to see some...

01:40:39.000 --> 01:40:44.000
I want to see heads roll over my account getting hacked.

01:40:44.000 --> 01:40:45.000
All right.

01:40:45.000 --> 01:40:47.000
That's going to do it for the Twitter topics for tonight.

01:40:47.000 --> 01:40:51.000
Let's talk about some of the year-end news.

01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:58.000
And we'll start off talking about some of our favorite games of the year and games you might call your game of the year.

01:40:58.000 --> 01:41:04.000
In chat room, we're taking your submissions as well, and I'll try to keep an eye on the Twitter, too, for those of you that can't be in chat.

01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:07.000
You know, what were some of your picks for the game of the year and why?

01:41:07.000 --> 01:41:13.000
Usually, I find these game of the year picks to be a little silly because it's just one person's opinion.

01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:17.000
So keep that in mind as we talk about our favorite games of the year.

01:41:17.000 --> 01:41:18.000
We're just gamers.

01:41:18.000 --> 01:41:19.000
We like what we like.

01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:25.000
And this is our opinion for the game that you think was the most important game of 2009.

01:41:25.000 --> 01:41:26.000
I'll start with Loki tonight.

01:41:26.000 --> 01:41:27.000
What do you think, Loki?

01:41:27.000 --> 01:41:28.000
What do you think were...

01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:30.000
And if you have a couple, go ahead.

01:41:30.000 --> 01:41:33.000
But what do you think overall was probably the biggest game of 2009?

01:41:33.000 --> 01:41:34.000
Of 2009?

01:41:34.000 --> 01:41:37.000
Well, probably Call of Duty Tomorrow Warfare 2 was, but I didn't play that game.

01:41:37.000 --> 01:41:44.000
So the game I liked, or at least just if I was going to vote based on how much I played it, I'd say Grand Theft Auto.

01:41:44.000 --> 01:41:48.000
Mainly the two expansions because that's what I was ending up playing.

01:41:48.000 --> 01:41:56.000
And, you know, I think it's kind of neat because, you know, whereas before we wouldn't really see expansions for Grand Theft Auto.

01:41:56.000 --> 01:42:01.000
We'd just see a couple other games kind of using the same engine, and still we may see that relatively soon.

01:42:01.000 --> 01:42:08.000
But it was kind of neat to kind of expand upon the story and kind of bring different perspectives to it and whatnot.

01:42:08.000 --> 01:42:09.000
And it was fun.

01:42:09.000 --> 01:42:13.000
They kind of brought back some of the old stuff that I thought should have been in there in the first place.

01:42:13.000 --> 01:42:17.000
A lot of the over-the-top stuff because they want to keep it grounded in reality, whatever.

01:42:17.000 --> 01:42:22.000
So that was kind of, you know, my favorite of the year.

01:42:22.000 --> 01:42:25.000
Other important games, I think DJ Hero was pretty big.

01:42:25.000 --> 01:42:31.000
You know, kind of a different take on the whole music game genre, and I kind of like that.

01:42:31.000 --> 01:42:35.000
I thought DJ Hero was horrifically underrated, and it's kind of sad.

01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:37.000
Like, you know, a lot of people were writing it off as a failure.

01:42:37.000 --> 01:42:44.000
But, you know, in looking at my Twitter and my Facebook, it seems like DJ Hero was a big-time Christmas present that was showing up for a lot of people.

01:42:44.000 --> 01:42:50.000
So maybe it'll find a second life of sorts as we get in past the holidays.

01:42:50.000 --> 01:42:56.000
And also some of the other underrated Wii games, you know, more of the mature stuff like Madworld.

01:42:56.000 --> 01:42:59.000
You know, I love that game. I thought it was pretty fun.

01:42:59.000 --> 01:43:04.000
And it's just, you know, unfortunately a lot of the mature stuff doesn't do well.

01:43:04.000 --> 01:43:06.000
Especially when they don't put a lot of press behind it.

01:43:06.000 --> 01:43:15.000
I mean, there are some commercials and stuff, but I don't think the mature audience is really that big right now on the Wii, which is too bad.

01:43:15.000 --> 01:43:19.000
Because a lot of people have kind of given up on it and just went elsewhere.

01:43:19.000 --> 01:43:21.000
So I'd have to, you know, vote that.

01:43:21.000 --> 01:43:24.000
And really, unfortunately, I didn't play a lot of other stuff.

01:43:24.000 --> 01:43:28.000
I'm sure Borderlands would be on my list if I had actually played that this year.

01:43:28.000 --> 01:43:32.000
And there's still time, but, you know, it's unfortunate.

01:43:32.000 --> 01:43:35.000
But, you know, that was probably a good one.

01:43:35.000 --> 01:43:42.000
I'm sure a little bit of, I'm sure Infinite would have been on there, because that was supposed to be pretty good.

01:43:42.000 --> 01:43:44.000
I just didn't get a chance to play it.

01:43:44.000 --> 01:43:48.000
Prototype was alright, but that was kind of crap.

01:43:48.000 --> 01:43:52.000
Street Fighter IV was kind of cool.

01:43:52.000 --> 01:43:56.000
I'm not really huge into the Street Fighter stuff, but that was kind of neat.

01:43:56.000 --> 01:44:00.000
And, you know, playing Tatsunoko versus Capcom won the import.

01:44:00.000 --> 01:44:03.000
That was actually pretty sweet, and I'd say that's going to be a good one this year.

01:44:03.000 --> 01:44:07.000
And of course, you know, just we got to joke and say it.

01:44:07.000 --> 01:44:13.000
President Cat is very strange and absolutely a weird game to come out.

01:44:13.000 --> 01:44:16.000
But I think it could do well over here.

01:44:16.000 --> 01:44:19.000
I mean, seriously, there's so much crap that comes out in the Wii.

01:44:19.000 --> 01:44:21.000
I don't understand why anybody couldn't take a chance.

01:44:21.000 --> 01:44:27.000
And, you know, there are companies like this, Graffiti Entertainment, Axis Game Localization.

01:44:27.000 --> 01:44:29.000
I mean, fuck, they're bringing over Choniki.

01:44:29.000 --> 01:44:32.000
Come on, man. Take the gamble.

01:44:32.000 --> 01:44:35.000
Alright, Loki's named about 20 different games for his game of the year.

01:44:35.000 --> 01:44:38.000
What do you think, DarkSakura? Is your list as long?

01:44:38.000 --> 01:44:43.000
Probably not, given that, I mean, Sims 3 came out, and that was big for me.

01:44:43.000 --> 01:44:47.000
Because I actually really enjoy Sims 3.

01:44:47.000 --> 01:44:54.000
I haven't gotten World Adventures, but that was, you know, especially now they've got the build a world thing for Sims 3.

01:44:54.000 --> 01:44:55.000
That's actually pretty cool.

01:44:55.000 --> 01:45:02.000
And the fact that, of course, it didn't take too long for all of the modders to start putting out their own hacks to the game,

01:45:02.000 --> 01:45:06.000
and their own items and stuff, so it was pretty cool.

01:45:06.000 --> 01:45:09.000
And of course, I love building houses.

01:45:09.000 --> 01:45:16.000
Other stuff, yeah, I've really been enjoying Danplay, Borderlands.

01:45:16.000 --> 01:45:18.000
I can't play it because I get, you know, motion sick.

01:45:18.000 --> 01:45:21.000
I've got my Silent Hill that I haven't played yet.

01:45:21.000 --> 01:45:28.000
I'm going to say, though, Street Fighter IV was really big for me, especially getting Sakura in the home release made me happy.

01:45:28.000 --> 01:45:31.000
Because then I could, you know, kick Dan's butt and be happy about it.

01:45:31.000 --> 01:45:36.000
Of course, though, we got it, like, right around the time my hand was really in bad shape.

01:45:36.000 --> 01:45:42.000
And I have to also second Tatsunoko vs Capcom, because, again, big Tatsunoko fan for me.

01:45:42.000 --> 01:45:44.000
Big Capcom fan.

01:45:44.000 --> 01:45:48.000
So the two together was just like a squeegasm in the process.

01:45:48.000 --> 01:45:59.000
And I remember sitting on the couch and being in absolute pain and still insisting on trying to beat the stupid bouncing ball in Tatsunoko vs Capcom.

01:45:59.000 --> 01:46:01.000
I'm like, look, they're playing the Gachomon music.

01:46:01.000 --> 01:46:03.000
Look, they're playing the Gachomon music.

01:46:03.000 --> 01:46:04.000
I'm so happy.

01:46:04.000 --> 01:46:08.000
You know, big, big, uh, squeegasm for me.

01:46:08.000 --> 01:46:10.000
Are you looking forward to the localization next year?

01:46:10.000 --> 01:46:11.000
Are you like, no thanks, Cas.

01:46:11.000 --> 01:46:12.000
Heck yeah.

01:46:12.000 --> 01:46:14.000
As long as they leave most of it in Japanese.

01:46:16.000 --> 01:46:17.000
Alright.

01:46:17.000 --> 01:46:18.000
I'm sorry, they've got the voice actors.

01:46:18.000 --> 01:46:20.000
How can you go wrong with that?

01:46:22.000 --> 01:46:23.000
Um, let's see.

01:46:23.000 --> 01:46:29.000
I would say there's probably three games I would bestow the Game of the Year honor upon.

01:46:29.000 --> 01:46:31.000
One of them you'll say, okay, yeah, I see that.

01:46:31.000 --> 01:46:33.000
Because it's something everybody else named.

01:46:33.000 --> 01:46:36.000
Uh, one of them you'll say, dammit, Rob, why'd you have to say that?

01:46:36.000 --> 01:46:39.000
And then the other one you're going to go, LOL, what the fuck?

01:46:39.000 --> 01:46:44.000
The first one I would say Dark Soccer and Loki also both said Street Fighter IV, I think was one of the best games that came out this year.

01:46:44.000 --> 01:46:48.000
I think it was an awesome upgrade to Street Fighter II, because we'll just ignore the third one.

01:46:48.000 --> 01:46:54.000
Uh, but I think, you know, it kind of brought a lot of people back to that series, including myself.

01:46:54.000 --> 01:46:57.000
And I thought some of the integration they did online was really great.

01:46:57.000 --> 01:47:02.000
And, uh, you know, it came out kind of early in the year, so I think a lot of people forget it was one of the games this year.

01:47:02.000 --> 01:47:05.000
But I think it did great, great things for fighting games this year.

01:47:05.000 --> 01:47:08.000
And, uh, you know, it's just going to continue on to next year when Super Street Fighter IV comes out.

01:47:08.000 --> 01:47:13.000
Very interesting, it's the one game all three of us named, so maybe you'd want to say that as the collective Game of the Year.

01:47:13.000 --> 01:47:14.000
I don't know.

01:47:14.000 --> 01:47:21.000
Um, let's see, also, I would say New Super Mario Bros. Wii is definitely worthy of the praise of Game of the Year.

01:47:21.000 --> 01:47:22.000
For some of the same reasons.

01:47:22.000 --> 01:47:29.000
And it pains me when Nintendo does this, because, dammit, I mean, Nintendo...

01:47:29.000 --> 01:47:35.000
They so rarely are putting out these games that are so appealing to the hardcore, if you will, gamers.

01:47:35.000 --> 01:47:41.000
But then there's that one diamond in the rough that comes out, and I mean, like, literally sparkling diamond.

01:47:41.000 --> 01:47:44.000
And New Super Mario Bros. Wii was kind of that game.

01:47:44.000 --> 01:47:49.000
It had a lot in there for veteran gamers like myself, you know, the nostalgia factor is obviously huge.

01:47:49.000 --> 01:47:52.000
But that nostalgia factor carries over to the basic gamers.

01:47:52.000 --> 01:48:00.000
They really did get it right in, you know, a lot of people don't want to touch Mario Galaxy, as great of a game as that is,

01:48:00.000 --> 01:48:04.000
because it's like, what? 3D Mario? Can't control? Ah, a little weird.

01:48:04.000 --> 01:48:07.000
But New Super Mario Bros. Wii kind of takes Mario back to its roots.

01:48:07.000 --> 01:48:09.000
And it's like, oh, jump on Google.

01:48:09.000 --> 01:48:11.000
That was pretty funny. That was pretty fun.

01:48:11.000 --> 01:48:14.000
And it's absolute chaos getting a bunch of people together.

01:48:14.000 --> 01:48:19.000
It is hell in four player mode, but I still kind of applaud Nintendo for making it work, so to speak.

01:48:19.000 --> 01:48:23.000
So I thought it was an awesome game.

01:48:23.000 --> 01:48:27.000
It brought a lot of gamers back to gaming.

01:48:27.000 --> 01:48:34.000
And you know, sometimes you want to hate Nintendo for this, but like I said, it's a diamond in the rough of the Wii software that's out there.

01:48:34.000 --> 01:48:38.000
Here's my LOL what the fuck pic for game of the year.

01:48:38.000 --> 01:48:40.000
And I honestly think it's deserving.

01:48:40.000 --> 01:48:43.000
And a lot of people are forgetting that this game is from this year.

01:48:43.000 --> 01:48:48.000
But it is absolutely one of the best things to happen to gaming this year.

01:48:48.000 --> 01:48:54.000
1 versus 100 on Xbox Live, I think, absolutely deserves the accolade of one of the games of the years.

01:48:54.000 --> 01:48:57.000
It's something new we haven't really seen before-ish.

01:48:57.000 --> 01:49:03.000
I mean, unless you want to go back to the old days of the Berkley Entertainment on the PC and Acrophobia and all this stuff.

01:49:03.000 --> 01:49:06.000
You know, we haven't really seen anything quite like it, this whole like game show thing.

01:49:06.000 --> 01:49:09.000
It's a lot of fun to actually play with friends.

01:49:09.000 --> 01:49:13.000
It really appeals to a broad base of people.

01:49:13.000 --> 01:49:16.000
It's kind of neat that you're actually playing for real money.

01:49:16.000 --> 01:49:19.000
I mean, it's such a different type of game.

01:49:19.000 --> 01:49:23.000
I give it such props for being new, different, and fun.

01:49:23.000 --> 01:49:28.000
Best of all, if you happen to be an Xbox Live Gold subscriber, it's free.

01:49:28.000 --> 01:49:31.000
Or even the silver folks got it free for a little while.

01:49:31.000 --> 01:49:34.000
So, you know, it's fair to say that this game was free.

01:49:34.000 --> 01:49:37.000
So, how can you go wrong?

01:49:37.000 --> 01:49:41.000
I think 1 versus 100 in some ways is the game of the year.

01:49:41.000 --> 01:49:46.000
And for whoever was asking earlier where our game is going in the future,

01:49:46.000 --> 01:49:49.000
I'll bet you see some more stuff like this, the interactive stuff.

01:49:49.000 --> 01:49:53.000
I think it's going to be very cool to see how that plays out in the next decade.

01:49:53.000 --> 01:49:55.000
So, check that out.

01:49:55.000 --> 01:49:57.000
So, those were our games of the year.

01:49:57.000 --> 01:49:59.000
What about you guys in our chat room?

01:49:59.000 --> 01:50:04.000
Some of you guys were naming some of your things here.

01:50:04.000 --> 01:50:06.000
GameGuru says, what's wrong with Street Fighter 3?

01:50:06.000 --> 01:50:08.000
Well, okay, it's pandering to the base.

01:50:08.000 --> 01:50:12.000
But still, I don't want to buy Street Fighter 4 when Super Street Fighter 4 is coming out.

01:50:12.000 --> 01:50:15.000
Yeah, that was unfortunate that Super Street Fighter 4 was announced kind of soon

01:50:15.000 --> 01:50:18.000
because, you know, it devalued the original.

01:50:18.000 --> 01:50:20.000
But, you know, we had Street Fighter 2 and Super Street Fighter 2,

01:50:20.000 --> 01:50:24.000
so I guess it's nothing too unheard of there.

01:50:24.000 --> 01:50:27.000
Let's see.

01:50:27.000 --> 01:50:30.000
Tigerclaw says, game of the year for me is Batman Arkham Asylum.

01:50:30.000 --> 01:50:32.000
You know, that did get a lot of props.

01:50:32.000 --> 01:50:34.000
Very good storytelling in that game.

01:50:34.000 --> 01:50:37.000
And certainly, panders to fans of Batman like in the comic form.

01:50:37.000 --> 01:50:40.000
They did a really good job with that game.

01:50:40.000 --> 01:50:43.000
They really did.

01:50:43.000 --> 01:50:48.000
You know, I really, really liked Harley in that game.

01:50:48.000 --> 01:50:51.000
You know, this is actually a game that convinced one of my friends to get an Xbox.

01:50:51.000 --> 01:50:53.000
It's really good storytelling.

01:50:53.000 --> 01:50:54.000
It was.

01:50:54.000 --> 01:50:57.000
Sj100Matt says, from the sports side here, NHL 10.

01:50:57.000 --> 01:51:01.000
Not only was it great, but it beat out Madden 10 for the best sports game at the VGAs.

01:51:01.000 --> 01:51:05.000
A hockey game beating out a football game? What?

01:51:05.000 --> 01:51:10.000
Well, we also got a contribution from Marin, Beatles Rock Band.

01:51:10.000 --> 01:51:13.000
Which, actually, I'm going to have to go with as well.

01:51:13.000 --> 01:51:15.000
But, you know, you should say that.

01:51:15.000 --> 01:51:16.000
Of course.

01:51:16.000 --> 01:51:17.000
Heart, heart, heart.

01:51:17.000 --> 01:51:20.000
Beatles Rock Band was an excellent implementation.

01:51:20.000 --> 01:51:23.000
I'm still opting for DJ Hero as my music game of the year,

01:51:23.000 --> 01:51:27.000
but I do respect greatly Beatles Rock Band,

01:51:27.000 --> 01:51:30.000
and I think it was badly needed.

01:51:30.000 --> 01:51:32.000
I think getting it out was a big achievement.

01:51:32.000 --> 01:51:34.000
I think so, too.

01:51:34.000 --> 01:51:38.000
And just to get everybody on stage at E3 to announce it, that was epic.

01:51:38.000 --> 01:51:39.000
Come on.

01:51:39.000 --> 01:51:44.000
Having Yoko Ono, George Harrison's wife, McCartney, you know, Ringo Starr,

01:51:44.000 --> 01:51:48.000
all on stage at once, pretty awesome.

01:51:48.000 --> 01:51:51.000
Pretty, pretty awesome.

01:51:51.000 --> 01:51:53.000
Speaking of some of the things that happened this year,

01:51:53.000 --> 01:51:55.000
just kind of like trekking back,

01:51:55.000 --> 01:51:58.000
and it's kind of funny to look back sometimes on what happened in previous months,

01:51:58.000 --> 01:52:00.000
kind of see where that put us this year.

01:52:00.000 --> 01:52:02.000
Just quickly going through some of the big things that happened this year.

01:52:02.000 --> 01:52:05.000
If you look at January and some of the things that happened there,

01:52:05.000 --> 01:52:08.000
a lot of restructuring and layoff news.

01:52:08.000 --> 01:52:11.000
You know, Sony did some restructuring and announced a 2.9 billion loss.

01:52:11.000 --> 01:52:16.000
Microsoft at once thought Invisible Company laid off 5,000 people.

01:52:16.000 --> 01:52:17.000
That both happened in January.

01:52:17.000 --> 01:52:20.000
Sadly, layoffs were a big thing this year.

01:52:20.000 --> 01:52:21.000
What do you guys think?

01:52:21.000 --> 01:52:24.000
Are we past that, or are we going to continue to see more layoffs?

01:52:24.000 --> 01:52:27.000
What's going to happen to all these people that lost their jobs in 09?

01:52:27.000 --> 01:52:30.000
It'll slow down, probably, as far as layoffs go,

01:52:30.000 --> 01:52:32.000
and probably hirings, even.

01:52:32.000 --> 01:52:35.000
You probably see a lot of these guys that got laid off from these companies

01:52:35.000 --> 01:52:37.000
forming their own smaller companies.

01:52:37.000 --> 01:52:39.000
That seems to be the trend.

01:52:39.000 --> 01:52:42.000
And interesting, because maybe that indie development

01:52:42.000 --> 01:52:47.000
is going to lead to more digital distribution, as we talked about before.

01:52:47.000 --> 01:52:48.000
Let's see.

01:52:48.000 --> 01:52:51.000
Moving on to February, some of the things that happened there,

01:52:51.000 --> 01:52:52.000
unfortunately, more losses.

01:52:52.000 --> 01:52:55.000
EA cut back 11% of their workforce.

01:52:55.000 --> 01:52:58.000
Activision, Blizzard, I don't know how the hell they lost money,

01:52:58.000 --> 01:52:59.000
but they sure did.

01:52:59.000 --> 01:53:03.000
And they did not do any huge layoffs, though, at that time.

01:53:03.000 --> 01:53:05.000
Also, though, what I thought was interesting,

01:53:05.000 --> 01:53:10.000
Wii Fit sold 777,000 copies in January.

01:53:10.000 --> 01:53:13.000
That news would then roll over to February.

01:53:13.000 --> 01:53:18.000
So, you know, Wii Fit was obviously a big piece of gaming in 2009

01:53:18.000 --> 01:53:21.000
that none of us named in our game of the year.

01:53:21.000 --> 01:53:23.000
Has Wii Fit been good or bad for gaming?

01:53:23.000 --> 01:53:25.000
What do you guys think?

01:53:25.000 --> 01:53:28.000
I wouldn't say in terms of gaming,

01:53:28.000 --> 01:53:34.000
but it's definitely been good in terms of making exercise enjoyable.

01:53:34.000 --> 01:53:37.000
Wii Fit is not something that I really consider to be a game.

01:53:37.000 --> 01:53:39.000
I consider it to be a tool.

01:53:39.000 --> 01:53:42.000
It's a fun tech demo, is really what it is.

01:53:42.000 --> 01:53:46.000
And I think a lot of stuff that Nintendo has done

01:53:46.000 --> 01:53:48.000
could be kind of considered a tech demo.

01:53:48.000 --> 01:53:50.000
Hell, Wii Sports and Wii Play,

01:53:50.000 --> 01:53:52.000
a lot of that stuff was just a tech demo for the Wii,

01:53:52.000 --> 01:53:55.000
and it ended up being pretty successful.

01:53:55.000 --> 01:54:00.000
I think, if anything, Wii Sports hurt gaming more than Wii Fit did.

01:54:00.000 --> 01:54:01.000
Wii Fit, eh, who cares?

01:54:01.000 --> 01:54:03.000
You know, it's an exercise game that comes out.

01:54:03.000 --> 01:54:04.000
I don't have to play that.

01:54:04.000 --> 01:54:06.000
Wii Sports, oh, look, it's like a party game.

01:54:06.000 --> 01:54:09.000
Every fucking game that seems to come out on the Wii nowadays

01:54:09.000 --> 01:54:13.000
is almost like a party game because Wii's the party console.

01:54:13.000 --> 01:54:14.000
Yeah, great.

01:54:14.000 --> 01:54:16.000
You know what, though?

01:54:16.000 --> 01:54:18.000
I would like some other types of games on there

01:54:18.000 --> 01:54:23.000
because there's at least one party game coming out every freaking week.

01:54:23.000 --> 01:54:26.000
Enough is enough.

01:54:26.000 --> 01:54:29.000
You want to see a party-free 2010?

01:54:29.000 --> 01:54:32.000
I would like to see them actually go back to what worked before.

01:54:32.000 --> 01:54:34.000
You don't necessarily need to change.

01:54:34.000 --> 01:54:36.000
Make some good side-scrolling games.

01:54:36.000 --> 01:54:40.000
Make some good, you know, just games that utilize the technology.

01:54:40.000 --> 01:54:42.000
Everything doesn't have to be a party game.

01:54:42.000 --> 01:54:44.000
Everything doesn't have to be a waggle fest.

01:54:44.000 --> 01:54:47.000
Just do it what worked.

01:54:47.000 --> 01:54:48.000
I mean, I don't understand it.

01:54:48.000 --> 01:54:51.000
We had a lot of games selling back in the day

01:54:51.000 --> 01:54:56.000
of the Super Nintendo and stuff, and even the NES and whatnot,

01:54:56.000 --> 01:54:59.000
and they didn't really rely on a lot of gimmicks.

01:54:59.000 --> 01:55:03.000
Made mode 7, but I mean, come on, it wasn't that bad.

01:55:03.000 --> 01:55:06.000
Moving into March, some of the big news from March

01:55:06.000 --> 01:55:08.000
was Game Developers Conference happened in March,

01:55:08.000 --> 01:55:10.000
and some of the big things that came out of Game Developers Conference

01:55:10.000 --> 01:55:13.000
was the DS Zelda game that we ended up getting a little later in the year.

01:55:13.000 --> 01:55:18.000
Also, OnLive and their on-demand game streaming.

01:55:18.000 --> 01:55:20.000
Do you remember hearing about this, OnLive?

01:55:20.000 --> 01:55:22.000
Do you think OnLive is something to take seriously,

01:55:22.000 --> 01:55:26.000
this whole on-demand game streaming in the future?

01:55:26.000 --> 01:55:30.000
It was supposed to be top-tier games from EA, Take-Two, Ubisoft.

01:55:30.000 --> 01:55:34.000
They will be on your PC and soon TVs later in the year,

01:55:34.000 --> 01:55:36.000
although of course that never happened.

01:55:36.000 --> 01:55:41.000
What do you think about OnLive in the future of that?

01:55:41.000 --> 01:55:44.000
I think that if it works like they say it is, then it's a good thing.

01:55:44.000 --> 01:55:47.000
I mean, it'll be pretty popular because everybody's really digging

01:55:47.000 --> 01:55:50.000
into streaming stuff nowadays, especially with Netflix

01:55:50.000 --> 01:55:53.000
and other video services out there.

01:55:53.000 --> 01:55:57.000
Steam as a digital distribution platform has done pretty well,

01:55:57.000 --> 01:56:01.000
so combining the two is not a bad thing.

01:56:01.000 --> 01:56:06.000
I think, though, reality is going to be slightly different than what's promised.

01:56:06.000 --> 01:56:11.000
I mean, it seems very hard to fathom that something like that is going to work.

01:56:11.000 --> 01:56:16.000
But hey, if it does, whatever the technology may be, then more power to them.

01:56:16.000 --> 01:56:18.000
And I'm sure if it works out for them,

01:56:18.000 --> 01:56:23.000
then the big three will probably try to find a way to do it themselves.

01:56:23.000 --> 01:56:25.000
Some of the news as we moved into April.

01:56:25.000 --> 01:56:27.000
Will Wright left EA.

01:56:27.000 --> 01:56:30.000
I kind of forgot that that happened,

01:56:30.000 --> 01:56:33.000
but that's when an epic designer leaves a big company like that.

01:56:33.000 --> 01:56:35.000
You always kind of wonder what the heck is going on there.

01:56:35.000 --> 01:56:38.000
Also, the disappointing sales of Chinatown Wars.

01:56:38.000 --> 01:56:41.000
Remember how in 2008, Nintendo got up there at E3 and said,

01:56:41.000 --> 01:56:44.000
hey, we've got a Grand Theft Auto game coming to the DS.

01:56:44.000 --> 01:56:49.000
It's going to be awesome, and it's going to try to get some of those hardcore players on our unit.

01:56:49.000 --> 01:56:53.000
It sold under 90,000 units in March, which is considered a disappointment.

01:56:53.000 --> 01:56:56.000
What happened with Grand Theft Auto Chinatown Wars?

01:56:56.000 --> 01:56:58.000
I didn't really care for it that much,

01:56:58.000 --> 01:57:01.000
and it's mainly because it's kind of going back to the old school game.

01:57:01.000 --> 01:57:06.000
I think we remember back in the day the old school one was pretty fun.

01:57:06.000 --> 01:57:10.000
But now that we have the newer ones, it's like,

01:57:10.000 --> 01:57:15.000
well, it's cool and all, but I would have rather had something more like the PSP.

01:57:15.000 --> 01:57:19.000
And there seems to be like, oh, well, you can't do that on the Nintendo system.

01:57:19.000 --> 01:57:21.000
It's just not powerful enough.

01:57:21.000 --> 01:57:23.000
But then we have Cop the Recruit that comes out.

01:57:23.000 --> 01:57:26.000
It looks just like the old PSP Grand Theft Auto games.

01:57:26.000 --> 01:57:30.000
And we have to go back to Rockstar and go, what the fuck?

01:57:30.000 --> 01:57:32.000
So you can do it, but you just didn't.

01:57:32.000 --> 01:57:34.000
You didn't really put the effort into it.

01:57:34.000 --> 01:57:38.000
Instead, you made these little mini games that involved the DS stylus.

01:57:38.000 --> 01:57:44.000
I guess that's neat and all, but it just really didn't hook me in like the other ones.

01:57:44.000 --> 01:57:49.000
I guess my standards have gone up since one and two.

01:57:49.000 --> 01:57:52.000
Well, not a lot happened in May, but then we got into June,

01:57:52.000 --> 01:57:55.000
and June was, of course, the big E3 expo.

01:57:55.000 --> 01:57:58.000
And at E3 was when we got a hell of a lot of news,

01:57:58.000 --> 01:58:02.000
including the unveiling of Project Natal from Microsoft,

01:58:02.000 --> 01:58:04.000
Sony showing their ice cream cone controller,

01:58:04.000 --> 01:58:07.000
whatever that thing is supposed to be for their motion sensing,

01:58:07.000 --> 01:58:10.000
and then Nintendo showing the Wii Vitality sensor.

01:58:10.000 --> 01:58:15.000
Looking back on E3 this year, any kind of thoughts about how the show went

01:58:15.000 --> 01:58:18.000
or kind of where we are now six months later?

01:58:18.000 --> 01:58:22.000
I think everyone was still pooping themselves over Natal.

01:58:22.000 --> 01:58:26.000
I think that Nintendo disappointed once again, you know,

01:58:26.000 --> 01:58:30.000
not as bad as the year prior, but this year was kind of pathetic.

01:58:30.000 --> 01:58:34.000
And I'm sorry, the Wii Vitality sensor.

01:58:34.000 --> 01:58:37.000
Okay, remember with the Wii Fit Balance Board, it's like,

01:58:37.000 --> 01:58:40.000
oh, it's going to revolutionize how you do these exercise games and stuff.

01:58:40.000 --> 01:58:42.000
And great, now we have a bunch of these games

01:58:42.000 --> 01:58:45.000
that have the Balance Board sensors in there,

01:58:45.000 --> 01:58:48.000
and we use it, and okay, that's great.

01:58:48.000 --> 01:58:54.000
Not a real huge step, I guess, but it's neat nonetheless.

01:58:54.000 --> 01:58:58.000
The Vitality sensor, I'm sorry, I don't see what the point is of this.

01:58:58.000 --> 01:59:01.000
I just don't get it, and I know they're going to have that stupid game,

01:59:01.000 --> 01:59:03.000
Wii Relax, come out.

01:59:03.000 --> 01:59:07.000
Great, you'll sell some copies of that, but I think it's crap.

01:59:07.000 --> 01:59:10.000
What happened to that Metroid game that Teen Ninja was doing?

01:59:10.000 --> 01:59:12.000
I mean, we saw a neat little preview of E3,

01:59:12.000 --> 01:59:14.000
and it's literally not a damn thing since then.

01:59:14.000 --> 01:59:18.000
Yeah, it's promises of stuff that will come later on, like next year.

01:59:18.000 --> 01:59:21.000
I'll be surprised if that game comes out this year.

01:59:21.000 --> 01:59:22.000
I will be surprised.

01:59:22.000 --> 01:59:23.000
2010, you mean?

01:59:23.000 --> 01:59:25.000
Yeah, 2010.

01:59:25.000 --> 01:59:27.000
I'll be surprised if it makes it out in 2010,

01:59:27.000 --> 01:59:32.000
but I don't know, it's just excuses and delays.

01:59:32.000 --> 01:59:34.000
A lot of the stuff, and they keep trying,

01:59:34.000 --> 01:59:37.000
it's almost like they're trying to grasp at, you know,

01:59:37.000 --> 01:59:40.000
they have like this really boring presentation,

01:59:40.000 --> 01:59:43.000
and they're trying to grasp at like the hardcore players are going like,

01:59:43.000 --> 01:59:44.000
fuck this, I'm out of here, you know.

01:59:44.000 --> 01:59:46.000
I'm done with this new presentation.

01:59:46.000 --> 01:59:49.000
We got the games that you want.

01:59:49.000 --> 01:59:50.000
They're coming.

01:59:50.000 --> 01:59:52.000
Don't worry, just be patient.

01:59:52.000 --> 01:59:55.000
I got to play devil's advocate here, though, because of what I just said.

01:59:55.000 --> 01:59:57.000
One of the other things Nintendo revealed at E3 this year,

01:59:57.000 --> 02:00:01.000
which was not expected by any means, was New Super Mario Brothers Wii,

02:00:01.000 --> 02:00:04.000
which, I'm sorry, is one of the best games that came out this year.

02:00:04.000 --> 02:00:05.000
It really was.

02:00:05.000 --> 02:00:08.000
Yeah, that's pretty sad that that's the best game that came out this year

02:00:08.000 --> 02:00:12.000
from Nintendo, a company that, you know, had really innovative games in the past.

02:00:12.000 --> 02:00:14.000
All have been, you know, really great titles,

02:00:14.000 --> 02:00:17.000
except recently some of their games that they released are kind of,

02:00:17.000 --> 02:00:20.000
eh, you know, whatever, I don't really care.

02:00:20.000 --> 02:00:22.000
I mean, seriously, what did they release this year?

02:00:22.000 --> 02:00:24.000
Let me think here.

02:00:24.000 --> 02:00:29.000
So we had Wii Fit Plus, which was basically just a port of Wii Fit,

02:00:29.000 --> 02:00:31.000
now with some added crap on there,

02:00:31.000 --> 02:00:35.000
and we're going to throw it in for a discount just to capitalize on Wii Fit again,

02:00:35.000 --> 02:00:37.000
because people may have forgotten about it.

02:00:37.000 --> 02:00:39.000
We had Wii Sports Resort, which comes with an extra sensor

02:00:39.000 --> 02:00:42.000
that really should have been in the Wii Remote to begin with,

02:00:42.000 --> 02:00:45.000
and kind of what they really promised with the Wii from the get-go,

02:00:45.000 --> 02:00:47.000
but, oh, we just couldn't do it.

02:00:47.000 --> 02:00:48.000
Right.

02:00:48.000 --> 02:00:51.000
You just couldn't add that extra sensor in there because it would be too expensive,

02:00:51.000 --> 02:00:54.000
or you just want to sell some more peripherals later on.

02:00:54.000 --> 02:00:55.000
Okay, great.

02:00:55.000 --> 02:00:58.000
So you repackaged Wii Sports, and we threw it back out there again.

02:00:58.000 --> 02:01:04.000
Okay, then you have, you know, New Super Mario Bros. Wii, which is fine.

02:01:04.000 --> 02:01:07.000
It's your traditional Mario Bros. game, which is really what a lot of people look for,

02:01:07.000 --> 02:01:10.000
because, you know, God forbid...

02:01:10.000 --> 02:01:11.000
And it was great!

02:01:11.000 --> 02:01:13.000
It was a great game that came out this year.

02:01:13.000 --> 02:01:16.000
Yeah, that, okay, and then Metroid Prime Trilogy,

02:01:16.000 --> 02:01:18.000
which was just a rehash of some old stuff.

02:01:18.000 --> 02:01:21.000
Then they added the new Play Control series,

02:01:21.000 --> 02:01:26.000
which is basically ported GameCube games that they've added some Wii controls to.

02:01:26.000 --> 02:01:31.000
Great! I'm glad you have the ability to port GameCube games and add Waggle to them.

02:01:31.000 --> 02:01:35.000
Way to be innovative.

02:01:35.000 --> 02:01:39.000
I'm sorry, it's just, you know, in looking at the first quarter slate for Nintendo,

02:01:39.000 --> 02:01:44.000
let's see, we have a remake of a couple Pokemon games.

02:01:44.000 --> 02:01:48.000
We have another Endless Ocean game, which, you know, the first one was kind of neat,

02:01:48.000 --> 02:01:51.000
but I don't think it really warranted a sequel.

02:01:51.000 --> 02:01:55.000
And then we have, let's see here, another cooking sim,

02:01:55.000 --> 02:02:01.000
which, to be honest, is exactly the same as the last cooking game that they had for Nintendo.

02:02:01.000 --> 02:02:04.000
I kid you not, the descriptions are almost identical,

02:02:04.000 --> 02:02:06.000
except they changed the name of the game,

02:02:06.000 --> 02:02:10.000
you know, because some people might, you know, get fooled by that.

02:02:10.000 --> 02:02:15.000
And what do they have other than, you know, the Zelda game for the DS, which was kind of cool.

02:02:15.000 --> 02:02:19.000
Let's see, they had some style simulation games,

02:02:19.000 --> 02:02:22.000
because God forbid there's not enough of those on the DS,

02:02:22.000 --> 02:02:25.000
you know, between Ubisoft and Dreamcatcher,

02:02:25.000 --> 02:02:28.000
there's so many damn games for girls.

02:02:28.000 --> 02:02:30.000
I mean, it just got lost in the fray right there.

02:02:30.000 --> 02:02:32.000
And a lot of things that they release,

02:02:32.000 --> 02:02:36.000
I think Nintendo thinks that their name's going to sell these titles.

02:02:36.000 --> 02:02:37.000
Well, that's not been the case.

02:02:37.000 --> 02:02:39.000
Fossil Fighters? Hello.

02:02:39.000 --> 02:02:44.000
There's been other games that have been put out exactly the same as that.

02:02:44.000 --> 02:02:45.000
It's just they just don't get it,

02:02:45.000 --> 02:02:47.000
and I'm sure they're going to promise some more stuff,

02:02:47.000 --> 02:02:49.000
maybe Pikmin 3, and then everyone will shit their pants,

02:02:49.000 --> 02:02:51.000
because it's Pikmin 3, and it's going to come out.

02:02:51.000 --> 02:02:53.000
It's going to be exactly the same as Pikmin 2,

02:02:53.000 --> 02:02:55.000
which just was some extra shit,

02:02:55.000 --> 02:03:00.000
and people are going to buy into it because they're fucking cheap.

02:03:00.000 --> 02:03:02.000
Well, we know Galaxy 2 is on the way, too.

02:03:02.000 --> 02:03:04.000
And I'm glad that New Super Mario Brothers,

02:03:04.000 --> 02:03:05.000
a completely original game,

02:03:05.000 --> 02:03:10.000
God forbid that it was like another New Super Mario Brothers game that came out on,

02:03:10.000 --> 02:03:11.000
oh, the DS. Oh, that's right.

02:03:11.000 --> 02:03:14.000
Very similar to that, except now we have four players,

02:03:14.000 --> 02:03:15.000
because it's a party game.

02:03:15.000 --> 02:03:18.000
Oh, party, because that's so awesome.

02:03:18.000 --> 02:03:22.000
You can play a single-player mode, and it's still a rewarding experience, I think.

02:03:22.000 --> 02:03:25.000
And there are new power-ups and new things they do in it.

02:03:25.000 --> 02:03:26.000
Oh, new power-ups.

02:03:26.000 --> 02:03:30.000
That's totally new for a Mario game, you bastard.

02:03:30.000 --> 02:03:31.000
New power-ups.

02:03:31.000 --> 02:03:32.000
Oh, my God.

02:03:32.000 --> 02:03:35.000
Oh, I take everything back that I said about Nintendo.

02:03:35.000 --> 02:03:40.000
Well, if they have new power-ups in there, then God forbid, Game of the Year.

02:03:40.000 --> 02:03:42.000
And Super Mario Galaxy 2,

02:03:42.000 --> 02:03:45.000
yeah, I'm sure that'll be very different than Galaxy 1.

02:03:45.000 --> 02:03:47.000
Oh, we added some different levels now.

02:03:47.000 --> 02:03:48.000
Praise us.

02:03:48.000 --> 02:03:50.000
All the work's been done on the engine before,

02:03:50.000 --> 02:03:52.000
but now we have new levels and new gimmicks,

02:03:52.000 --> 02:03:56.000
and you're going to think, oh, my God, it's so awesome.

02:03:56.000 --> 02:03:59.000
And yell in that same little girly voice.

02:03:59.000 --> 02:04:01.000
Maybe we'll get Twilight Princess 2.

02:04:01.000 --> 02:04:03.000
It'll be exactly the same as Twilight Princess 1,

02:04:03.000 --> 02:04:04.000
but it'll have some slightly new levels in it.

02:04:04.000 --> 02:04:05.000
You know there's going to be the Zelda...

02:04:05.000 --> 02:04:07.000
Maybe they'll fuse them and do Majora's Princess.

02:04:07.000 --> 02:04:09.000
You know there's going to be the Zelda game.

02:04:09.000 --> 02:04:11.000
That's going to be the big thing they're going to unveil at E3 this year.

02:04:11.000 --> 02:04:13.000
Mark my words, 2010 predictions.

02:04:13.000 --> 02:04:15.000
New Zelda will be the thing.

02:04:15.000 --> 02:04:17.000
Nintendo tries to redeem themselves with this year.

02:04:17.000 --> 02:04:19.000
You know what's great about Nintendo, though?

02:04:19.000 --> 02:04:22.000
Their fans are so dumb and so forgiving of everything that they do,

02:04:22.000 --> 02:04:24.000
they'll sell a million copies no matter what they do.

02:04:24.000 --> 02:04:26.000
They could shit in a box and call it Metroid

02:04:26.000 --> 02:04:29.000
and give it to you and you'd buy it because you're fucking stupid.

02:04:29.000 --> 02:04:31.000
Way to go, folks.

02:04:31.000 --> 02:04:34.000
You know, anything that you want them to do correctly,

02:04:34.000 --> 02:04:36.000
they're never going to do anymore because, you know what,

02:04:36.000 --> 02:04:37.000
you'll buy their shit.

02:04:37.000 --> 02:04:39.000
I'm sorry, I still stand by it.

02:04:39.000 --> 02:04:41.000
As much as you're calling it recycled garbage and all this stuff,

02:04:41.000 --> 02:04:43.000
if it's still a good game,

02:04:43.000 --> 02:04:47.000
I think Mario Galaxy 2 has the potential to be really awesome

02:04:47.000 --> 02:04:50.000
because Galaxy 1 was great

02:04:50.000 --> 02:04:53.000
and if they just improve on that, it's going to get even better.

02:04:53.000 --> 02:04:57.000
I mean, you can't say that they don't have sequels and rehash shit

02:04:57.000 --> 02:04:59.000
on the 360 and the PS3 as well.

02:04:59.000 --> 02:05:02.000
Oh, they do. I call them out for it.

02:05:02.000 --> 02:05:06.000
We have a game that comes out every year that's a rehash of the last year's game.

02:05:06.000 --> 02:05:08.000
We call it Madden.

02:05:08.000 --> 02:05:10.000
And NBA Live.

02:05:10.000 --> 02:05:12.000
And NBA 2K.

02:05:12.000 --> 02:05:14.000
And Dance Dance Revolution.

02:05:14.000 --> 02:05:16.000
And Dance Dance Revolution.

02:05:16.000 --> 02:05:19.000
And God forbid, you know, Call of Duty.

02:05:19.000 --> 02:05:23.000
There's a lot of companies that are guilty of that,

02:05:23.000 --> 02:05:27.000
but the fact that Nintendo has the balls to go,

02:05:27.000 --> 02:05:30.000
hey, look, we're taking these GameCube games

02:05:30.000 --> 02:05:31.000
and we're putting them on the Wii.

02:05:31.000 --> 02:05:34.000
They're new because they're now on the Wii.

02:05:34.000 --> 02:05:37.000
We didn't really do anything to them other than change the controls.

02:05:37.000 --> 02:05:41.000
If that's the case, where the fuck is my F-Zero?

02:05:41.000 --> 02:05:45.000
That is the one GameCube game I have yet to see come over to the Wii.

02:05:45.000 --> 02:05:48.000
And might I point out, not only is it just a GameCube game,

02:05:48.000 --> 02:05:52.000
it was the best fucking GameCube game that ever came out.

02:05:52.000 --> 02:05:56.000
Well, I'm sorry, they have to do Donkey Kong's Jungle Beat first

02:05:56.000 --> 02:05:58.000
because apparently people like that game.

02:05:58.000 --> 02:06:01.000
It didn't sell very well with the bongos, but hey, you know.

02:06:01.000 --> 02:06:04.000
And you know what, we can also do a Donkey Kong racing game

02:06:04.000 --> 02:06:06.000
that used to be with the bongos,

02:06:06.000 --> 02:06:09.000
but no, now we're just going to add some sort of wacky controls.

02:06:09.000 --> 02:06:11.000
Three words. Three words.

02:06:11.000 --> 02:06:14.000
Fuck Donkey Kong.

02:06:14.000 --> 02:06:17.000
Donkey Kong is best left to the memory of the Super Nintendo

02:06:17.000 --> 02:06:21.000
awesomely 3D rendered games Donkey Kong countries that were there.

02:06:21.000 --> 02:06:24.000
I'm over it. Let's move on.

02:06:24.000 --> 02:06:28.000
Where's my F-Zero game that I can play online?

02:06:28.000 --> 02:06:32.000
Dude, where's my good updated Star Fox?

02:06:32.000 --> 02:06:36.000
And they always manage to take their sequels and fuck them over in some way.

02:06:36.000 --> 02:06:41.000
Perfect example, Excite Truck, the best racing game on the Wii.

02:06:41.000 --> 02:06:45.000
Sequel set to come out, Excite Bots Trick Racing.

02:06:45.000 --> 02:06:46.000
What the fuck did you do there?

02:06:46.000 --> 02:06:50.000
Oh, people like Transformers.

02:06:50.000 --> 02:06:53.000
What the fuck does throwing a pie at a clown have anything to do with racing?

02:06:53.000 --> 02:06:56.000
It doesn't have anything to do with racing.

02:06:56.000 --> 02:06:59.000
And God forbid they just shit on that sequel.

02:06:59.000 --> 02:07:02.000
But I was an idiot and bought it because, you know,

02:07:02.000 --> 02:07:04.000
I had hope that it was going to be as good as the original,

02:07:04.000 --> 02:07:07.000
but no, it wasn't.

02:07:07.000 --> 02:07:09.000
Fool me once.

02:07:09.000 --> 02:07:12.000
You will not fool me twice.

02:07:12.000 --> 02:07:15.000
I see some chat, and the chat's kind of flying right now.

02:07:15.000 --> 02:07:17.000
I can't really keep up with it, but I do see Game Guru

02:07:17.000 --> 02:07:19.000
saying something about the God of War collection.

02:07:19.000 --> 02:07:21.000
It's God of War 1 and 2 in HD.

02:07:21.000 --> 02:07:23.000
Rar. I mean, does that fall into-

02:07:23.000 --> 02:07:25.000
At least it's in HD.

02:07:25.000 --> 02:07:28.000
If they improve the graphics on the Wii games on those new play control games,

02:07:28.000 --> 02:07:30.000
hey, that's different, okay?

02:07:30.000 --> 02:07:31.000
Because that's, you know-

02:07:31.000 --> 02:07:33.000
Well, would they have widescreen now?

02:07:33.000 --> 02:07:35.000
Oh.

02:07:35.000 --> 02:07:38.000
Well, I take it all back.

02:07:38.000 --> 02:07:42.000
But might I point out, F-Zero, again,

02:07:42.000 --> 02:07:45.000
which I worship that game's cock because it's amazing,

02:07:45.000 --> 02:07:48.000
F-Zero on the GameCube had widescreen support.

02:07:48.000 --> 02:07:50.000
It had, if I remember right, progressive scan support

02:07:50.000 --> 02:07:52.000
and all that fancy stuff on the GameCube.

02:07:52.000 --> 02:07:54.000
Same with God of War 2.

02:07:54.000 --> 02:08:01.000
That also had 720p support through a code.

02:08:01.000 --> 02:08:04.000
Can we move on past the Nintendo hatred?

02:08:04.000 --> 02:08:05.000
Yes, we can.

02:08:05.000 --> 02:08:06.000
And the thousands of subscribers.

02:08:06.000 --> 02:08:09.000
We just lost all the Nintendo fanboys,

02:08:09.000 --> 02:08:10.000
crying in the corner.

02:08:10.000 --> 02:08:12.000
I still stand by, you know what, again,

02:08:12.000 --> 02:08:15.000
the thing that pisses me off about Nintendo

02:08:15.000 --> 02:08:18.000
is that it's not that I don't disagree with Loki.

02:08:18.000 --> 02:08:21.000
Most of what he's saying I pretend to agree with,

02:08:21.000 --> 02:08:24.000
but then they release that one fucking game

02:08:24.000 --> 02:08:27.000
that's so fucking great, I have to have it,

02:08:27.000 --> 02:08:29.000
and it justifies the purchase of a Wii.

02:08:29.000 --> 02:08:33.000
And you have all this shit out there flooding the market

02:08:33.000 --> 02:08:35.000
in that one game on the goddamn Wii

02:08:35.000 --> 02:08:38.000
that you just aren't going to get anywhere else,

02:08:38.000 --> 02:08:41.000
like New Super Mario Brothers Wii.

02:08:41.000 --> 02:08:46.000
Just like Mario Kart, Super Mario Kart and Mario Kart 64,

02:08:46.000 --> 02:08:50.000
the best fucking deathmatch battle mode ever

02:08:50.000 --> 02:08:52.000
was in those games.

02:08:52.000 --> 02:08:54.000
And then the GameCube and the Wii version,

02:08:54.000 --> 02:08:59.000
they just like, eh, let's just fucking ruin it.

02:08:59.000 --> 02:09:02.000
We don't know what plays that.

02:09:02.000 --> 02:09:03.000
Who cares?

02:09:03.000 --> 02:09:05.000
We'll just fuck it over, because no one.

02:09:05.000 --> 02:09:08.000
You think that's how the boardroom meetings go?

02:09:08.000 --> 02:09:11.000
Let's fuck this game up just for fun today.

02:09:11.000 --> 02:09:12.000
We're in a recession.

02:09:12.000 --> 02:09:13.000
Let's have fun with it.

02:09:13.000 --> 02:09:16.000
All they had to do was leave it exactly the same

02:09:16.000 --> 02:09:17.000
and just make new levels.

02:09:17.000 --> 02:09:18.000
That's it.

02:09:18.000 --> 02:09:19.000
No improvement needed.

02:09:19.000 --> 02:09:21.000
It was perfect the way it was.

02:09:21.000 --> 02:09:24.000
But somehow they just go, eh, no!

02:09:24.000 --> 02:09:26.000
Throwing it together!

02:09:26.000 --> 02:09:28.000
And they just ruined the whole thing

02:09:28.000 --> 02:09:30.000
because they wanted to improve upon it.

02:09:30.000 --> 02:09:32.000
Way to go!

02:09:32.000 --> 02:09:34.000
Have you ever heard the phrase, you know,

02:09:34.000 --> 02:09:38.000
if it ain't broke, don't fix it?

02:09:38.000 --> 02:09:39.000
All right, let's move on.

02:09:39.000 --> 02:09:40.000
Yes, please.

02:09:40.000 --> 02:09:41.000
All right.

02:09:41.000 --> 02:09:42.000
How about July?

02:09:42.000 --> 02:09:43.000
Hey, July.

02:09:43.000 --> 02:09:46.000
Some publishers went kaput in July.

02:09:46.000 --> 02:09:49.000
Eidos got retired, because obviously it folded

02:09:49.000 --> 02:09:50.000
into Square Enix,

02:09:50.000 --> 02:09:53.000
and so they don't really use the Eidos label anymore.

02:09:53.000 --> 02:09:54.000
And Midway closed.

02:09:54.000 --> 02:09:56.000
Remember all this stuff that was going on with Midway

02:09:56.000 --> 02:09:59.000
and bankruptcy and LOL liquidation

02:09:59.000 --> 02:10:01.000
and all this stuff that was going on with Midway

02:10:01.000 --> 02:10:03.000
and all their assets?

02:10:03.000 --> 02:10:05.000
What happened to Midway?

02:10:05.000 --> 02:10:07.000
Loki, what happened?

02:10:07.000 --> 02:10:09.000
Maybe I should go to dark soccer for a little while.

02:10:09.000 --> 02:10:10.000
I need a little less angst over here.

02:10:10.000 --> 02:10:12.000
What happened to Midway?

02:10:12.000 --> 02:10:15.000
It's just decision after decision, I think.

02:10:15.000 --> 02:10:19.000
It was inevitable, especially given how many...

02:10:19.000 --> 02:10:22.000
You want to go ahead and open the door?

02:10:22.000 --> 02:10:26.000
I think that it was just given... what?

02:10:26.000 --> 02:10:27.000
No, I just would get some cool air in here.

02:10:27.000 --> 02:10:29.000
It's getting stuffy, that's all.

02:10:29.000 --> 02:10:30.000
Rob, it's just me.

02:10:30.000 --> 02:10:31.000
Well, Loki's ranting.

02:10:31.000 --> 02:10:33.000
Just got the temperature up in here about 10 degrees,

02:10:33.000 --> 02:10:35.000
so I needed it to cool off a little bit.

02:10:35.000 --> 02:10:37.000
Sorry, dark soccer.

02:10:37.000 --> 02:10:41.000
I think that it was just...

02:10:41.000 --> 02:10:42.000
It was bound to happen.

02:10:42.000 --> 02:10:44.000
You know, they've been losing money.

02:10:44.000 --> 02:10:48.000
And, you know, especially given,

02:10:48.000 --> 02:10:51.000
weren't they still the ones who solely owned

02:10:51.000 --> 02:10:54.000
the Mortal Kombat franchise for a while?

02:10:54.000 --> 02:10:57.000
Those games certainly weren't doing much of anything.

02:10:57.000 --> 02:10:58.000
Yeah, sadly.

02:10:58.000 --> 02:11:00.000
I mean, they had the DC Universe game, but it was...

02:11:00.000 --> 02:11:01.000
That was crap.

02:11:01.000 --> 02:11:03.000
Yeah.

02:11:03.000 --> 02:11:05.000
I think it was just inevitable.

02:11:05.000 --> 02:11:08.000
Because apparently Blitz League did not pay the bills.

02:11:08.000 --> 02:11:10.000
And then their next genius idea,

02:11:10.000 --> 02:11:12.000
which thankfully never came out,

02:11:12.000 --> 02:11:14.000
This is Vegas.

02:11:14.000 --> 02:11:17.000
Yes, the game that simulates going to Vegas.

02:11:17.000 --> 02:11:23.000
Partying, driving cars, having sex with women, and gambling.

02:11:23.000 --> 02:11:26.000
What?

02:11:26.000 --> 02:11:29.000
Let's see, some of the news that came out of August.

02:11:29.000 --> 02:11:33.000
Apparently Wii Sports Resort was the best-selling game of August.

02:11:33.000 --> 02:11:34.000
There you go, Loki.

02:11:34.000 --> 02:11:36.000
I thought I'd mention that just for you.

02:11:36.000 --> 02:11:38.000
And the PlayStation 3 Slim was unveiled.

02:11:38.000 --> 02:11:41.000
So let's get away from Nintendo for a minute here

02:11:41.000 --> 02:11:43.000
and talk about maybe the PlayStation 3,

02:11:43.000 --> 02:11:45.000
because I think this was probably the smartest thing Sony did all year.

02:11:45.000 --> 02:11:47.000
It was something they should have done a year ago,

02:11:47.000 --> 02:11:50.000
was drop the price down to $299.

02:11:50.000 --> 02:11:52.000
Yes, they were retarded from the get-go,

02:11:52.000 --> 02:11:55.000
saying, oh yeah, our system's going to be $599.

02:11:55.000 --> 02:11:56.000
What?

02:11:56.000 --> 02:11:57.000
Don't you remember that YouTube?

02:11:57.000 --> 02:11:59.000
Because I know we played it on this show like a million times.

02:11:59.000 --> 02:12:02.000
It was the press conference in under a minute that would go,

02:12:02.000 --> 02:12:06.000
$599 US dollars, $599 US dollars.

02:12:06.000 --> 02:12:08.000
And just like over and over again.

02:12:08.000 --> 02:12:10.000
Because that really was the moment.

02:12:10.000 --> 02:12:12.000
Everybody was so jazzed about the PlayStation 3,

02:12:12.000 --> 02:12:14.000
and then they're like, it's going to be $599.

02:12:14.000 --> 02:12:19.000
And everybody's like, I remember us watching that on TV.

02:12:19.000 --> 02:12:22.000
We're like, are you fucking kidding me?

02:12:22.000 --> 02:12:24.000
Or Africa.

02:12:24.000 --> 02:12:26.000
Which finally came out this year, didn't it?

02:12:26.000 --> 02:12:30.000
And it sucked.

02:12:30.000 --> 02:12:32.000
Well, I'm trying to find that real quick,

02:12:32.000 --> 02:12:34.000
since we are talking about the decade here.

02:12:34.000 --> 02:12:36.000
Oh yes, here's one of the highlights of the decade,

02:12:36.000 --> 02:12:39.000
the 2006 Sony press conference.

02:12:39.000 --> 02:12:40.000
I love this clip.

02:12:40.000 --> 02:12:42.000
It's one of my favorite YouTubes of the year.

02:12:42.000 --> 02:12:45.000
So let's just take a look back at how we got to the slim

02:12:45.000 --> 02:12:47.000
finally this year at $299.

02:12:47.000 --> 02:12:50.000
Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome Kaz Harai.

02:12:50.000 --> 02:12:53.000
Ridge Racer.

02:12:53.000 --> 02:12:56.000
The essence of the PlayStation DNA is real change,

02:12:56.000 --> 02:12:59.000
and the consumers are ready.

02:12:59.000 --> 02:13:04.000
Genji 2 is an Ashen game, which is based on Japanese history.

02:13:04.000 --> 02:13:06.000
Ridge Racer.

02:13:06.000 --> 02:13:10.000
Being based on history, the stages of the game

02:13:10.000 --> 02:13:13.000
can also be based on famous battles,

02:13:13.000 --> 02:13:16.000
which actually took place in ancient Japan.

02:13:16.000 --> 02:13:19.000
So here's this giant enemy crab.

02:13:19.000 --> 02:13:21.000
Ridge Racer.

02:13:21.000 --> 02:13:25.000
And you attack its weak point for massive damage.

02:13:25.000 --> 02:13:27.000
It's Ridge Racer.

02:13:27.000 --> 02:13:29.000
Ridge Racer.

02:13:29.000 --> 02:13:33.000
PlayStation 3 will retail for $599.

02:13:33.000 --> 02:13:35.000
$599.

02:13:35.000 --> 02:13:37.000
$599.

02:13:37.000 --> 02:13:39.000
Giant enemy crab.

02:13:39.000 --> 02:13:40.000
$599.

02:13:40.000 --> 02:13:41.000
$599.

02:13:41.000 --> 02:13:43.000
$599 US dollars.

02:13:43.000 --> 02:13:45.000
It's Ridge Racer.

02:13:45.000 --> 02:13:47.000
Ridge Racer.

02:13:47.000 --> 02:13:49.000
That is the best thing to come out of the decade,

02:13:49.000 --> 02:13:52.000
by the way, in gaming, was that little one-minute clip

02:13:52.000 --> 02:13:54.000
from YouTube user macaw45.

02:13:54.000 --> 02:13:59.000
Congratulations.

02:13:59.000 --> 02:14:00.000
Why didn't they do it sooner, Loki?

02:14:00.000 --> 02:14:02.000
Why didn't Sony figure out,

02:14:02.000 --> 02:14:05.000
maybe we should have dropped the price a long time ago.

02:14:05.000 --> 02:14:08.000
Were they just stubborn with the whole Blu-ray thing?

02:14:08.000 --> 02:14:10.000
If they would have dropped the price sooner,

02:14:10.000 --> 02:14:11.000
they would have sold more units,

02:14:11.000 --> 02:14:13.000
but they would have also lost their ass

02:14:13.000 --> 02:14:15.000
from the cost of the system.

02:14:15.000 --> 02:14:17.000
And the problem was just building a system

02:14:17.000 --> 02:14:21.000
with that much in components in the first place,

02:14:21.000 --> 02:14:24.000
it's tough to justify.

02:14:24.000 --> 02:14:26.000
So they ended up having to cut some corners and stuff,

02:14:26.000 --> 02:14:28.000
and once the prices of the components came down,

02:14:28.000 --> 02:14:32.000
they could actually justify dropping the price of the system.

02:14:32.000 --> 02:14:35.000
It was a little late, so they have some catching up to do,

02:14:35.000 --> 02:14:37.000
but we'll see.

02:14:37.000 --> 02:14:39.000
September, some other companies followed along

02:14:39.000 --> 02:14:40.000
with some price drops.

02:14:40.000 --> 02:14:42.000
The Wii dropped to $200.

02:14:42.000 --> 02:14:44.000
That happened in September.

02:14:44.000 --> 02:14:47.000
And some of the information came out about the PSP Go

02:14:47.000 --> 02:14:50.000
that there would be no conversion that happens.

02:14:50.000 --> 02:14:53.000
Like if you own a UMD and you want to upgrade to the PSP Go,

02:14:53.000 --> 02:14:59.000
you can rebuy your game because of licensing issues.

02:14:59.000 --> 02:15:01.000
Licensing issues.

02:15:01.000 --> 02:15:04.000
But wait, the PSP Go wasn't confirmed yet, was it?

02:15:04.000 --> 02:15:06.000
I think by September it was.

02:15:06.000 --> 02:15:08.000
They showed it at E3, dummy.

02:15:08.000 --> 02:15:10.000
No, it wasn't at E3.

02:15:10.000 --> 02:15:12.000
Yes it was, it was in that back room, wasn't it?

02:15:12.000 --> 02:15:14.000
You were wrong.

02:15:14.000 --> 02:15:15.000
I could have sworn it was there.

02:15:15.000 --> 02:15:16.000
PSP Go was not at E3.

02:15:16.000 --> 02:15:18.000
PSP Go was shown at Gamescom.

02:15:18.000 --> 02:15:20.000
Fine.

02:15:20.000 --> 02:15:26.000
So by September, Gamescom happened anyway.

02:15:26.000 --> 02:15:29.000
Let's see, and then moving on into more recent things

02:15:29.000 --> 02:15:33.000
that happened to sum up 2009.

02:15:33.000 --> 02:15:37.000
Well, when the PSP Go finally did launch in October,

02:15:37.000 --> 02:15:42.000
that added 100 PSP games to the PlayStation Network.

02:15:42.000 --> 02:15:44.000
And that was really some of the biggest stuff that came out.

02:15:44.000 --> 02:15:49.000
Otherwise, some of the stuff about Modern Warfare 2

02:15:49.000 --> 02:15:51.000
was coming out pretty soon.

02:15:51.000 --> 02:15:53.000
And some news about the DSi XL,

02:15:53.000 --> 02:15:55.000
although that hasn't come out yet.

02:15:55.000 --> 02:15:58.000
The early news of that came out in October.

02:15:58.000 --> 02:16:00.000
DSi XL.

02:16:00.000 --> 02:16:02.000
What do you think?

02:16:02.000 --> 02:16:05.000
It's just, it's unnecessary.

02:16:05.000 --> 02:16:10.000
I'm really at the point of all of this that I'm like,

02:16:10.000 --> 02:16:13.000
whatever, people are gonna buy it, whatever,

02:16:13.000 --> 02:16:14.000
I'm not getting one.

02:16:14.000 --> 02:16:16.000
Not yet anyway.

02:16:16.000 --> 02:16:18.000
It's unnecessary, it really is.

02:16:18.000 --> 02:16:19.000
Let's keep shrinking down the system.

02:16:19.000 --> 02:16:21.000
Oh wait, let's make it bigger.

02:16:21.000 --> 02:16:24.000
Okay, put the Game Boy Advance slot back in it then,

02:16:24.000 --> 02:16:25.000
if you're gonna make it bigger.

02:16:25.000 --> 02:16:27.000
Oh no, we can't do that.

02:16:27.000 --> 02:16:28.000
Alright.

02:16:28.000 --> 02:16:30.000
What's the point of making the screens bigger?

02:16:30.000 --> 02:16:31.000
For old people.

02:16:31.000 --> 02:16:33.000
Because bigger's better.

02:16:33.000 --> 02:16:34.000
Yeah, it's for old people.

02:16:34.000 --> 02:16:36.000
But remember, remember with the Game Boy Advance,

02:16:36.000 --> 02:16:38.000
smaller was better, hence the micro.

02:16:38.000 --> 02:16:40.000
And then that didn't sell very well,

02:16:40.000 --> 02:16:42.000
so they must have said, oh, never mind, bigger's better.

02:16:42.000 --> 02:16:43.000
Right?

02:16:43.000 --> 02:16:45.000
And it's a spectator system now, remember?

02:16:45.000 --> 02:16:52.000
Because people want to watch you play DSi games.

02:16:52.000 --> 02:16:55.000
Then I suggest you put a video out on the system.

02:16:55.000 --> 02:16:57.000
There's a thought.

02:16:57.000 --> 02:16:59.000
Play it on your TV.

02:16:59.000 --> 02:17:01.000
And yes, I understand that wouldn't really make sense,

02:17:01.000 --> 02:17:05.000
you know, playing a DSi on a TV since it's dual screen,

02:17:05.000 --> 02:17:09.000
but hey, you could maybe split the video signal or something,

02:17:09.000 --> 02:17:14.000
or you could just put the top screen on there.

02:17:14.000 --> 02:17:16.000
Bottom screen, whatever.

02:17:16.000 --> 02:17:18.000
Just jamming through the last couple months here,

02:17:18.000 --> 02:17:19.000
because they did just happen.

02:17:19.000 --> 02:17:21.000
In November, of course, EA cut 1,500 jobs.

02:17:21.000 --> 02:17:23.000
That was 17% of their games.

02:17:23.000 --> 02:17:25.000
Canceled a dozen games.

02:17:25.000 --> 02:17:27.000
Not good year for EA in that department,

02:17:27.000 --> 02:17:30.000
because that was the second big layoff story we got out of EA in the year.

02:17:30.000 --> 02:17:32.000
And that was also the month where we had a funny story

02:17:32.000 --> 02:17:34.000
about how World of Warcraft was closed in China for three months,

02:17:34.000 --> 02:17:36.000
and we kind of joked about what would happen

02:17:36.000 --> 02:17:38.000
if you couldn't log into World of Warcraft for three months.

02:17:38.000 --> 02:17:41.000
There would be some people that just wouldn't know what to do with themselves.

02:17:41.000 --> 02:17:43.000
People would go outdoors.

02:17:43.000 --> 02:17:44.000
I know it would be.

02:17:44.000 --> 02:17:46.000
And then they would take all my oxygen.

02:17:46.000 --> 02:17:47.000
What can we do about that?

02:17:47.000 --> 02:17:50.000
And then one of my favorite rumors that came out in December

02:17:50.000 --> 02:17:55.000
that Logitech apparently is making a UMD add-on for the PSP Go.

02:17:55.000 --> 02:17:58.000
I mean, how ridiculous is that idea?

02:17:58.000 --> 02:18:00.000
A, why would it be coming from Logitech,

02:18:00.000 --> 02:18:02.000
unless I guess they're doing it on behalf of Sony or whatever,

02:18:02.000 --> 02:18:04.000
but still, just what?

02:18:04.000 --> 02:18:05.000
It's dumb.

02:18:05.000 --> 02:18:07.000
Isn't that the point?

02:18:07.000 --> 02:18:10.000
First off, why would you buy that?

02:18:10.000 --> 02:18:14.000
I don't understand why you would even pay the money to buy a UMD add-on

02:18:14.000 --> 02:18:19.000
for a system that was more expensive than the PSP 3000 in the first place.

02:18:19.000 --> 02:18:23.000
And the PSP 3000 has everything that the Go has,

02:18:23.000 --> 02:18:26.000
with the exception of the Bluetooth, which is fine.

02:18:26.000 --> 02:18:31.000
But I also don't understand why you would do that.

02:18:31.000 --> 02:18:33.000
You'd have to be pretty dumb.

02:18:33.000 --> 02:18:37.000
Just pull the PSP Go off shelves already and cut your losses

02:18:37.000 --> 02:18:39.000
and make a PSP 2 or something.

02:18:39.000 --> 02:18:40.000
I don't know.

02:18:40.000 --> 02:18:41.000
All right.

02:18:41.000 --> 02:18:43.000
That does it for kind of our year, a little wrap-up there,

02:18:43.000 --> 02:18:45.000
kind of walking down memory lane and some of the stories there.

02:18:45.000 --> 02:18:47.000
We're going to get to the decade in a little bit.

02:18:47.000 --> 02:18:50.000
I'm going to kind of just open up the Skype line

02:18:50.000 --> 02:18:52.000
to kind of talk about the decade.

02:18:52.000 --> 02:18:53.000
We'll get to that in a minute,

02:18:53.000 --> 02:18:55.000
but of course we do have some segments we like to do here every week

02:18:55.000 --> 02:18:56.000
on Orange Lounge Radio.

02:18:56.000 --> 02:18:58.000
And one of them is very important.

02:18:58.000 --> 02:19:00.000
It's our moments of angst,

02:19:00.000 --> 02:19:03.000
because there were a lot of stupid people this year

02:19:03.000 --> 02:19:06.000
and stupid people that robbed things,

02:19:06.000 --> 02:19:09.000
like that guy who stole the Xbox and then played it

02:19:09.000 --> 02:19:11.000
so they were able to find who they were.

02:19:11.000 --> 02:19:13.000
Just a lot of stupidity out there.

02:19:13.000 --> 02:19:16.000
He who shall not be named, the lawyer that was disbarred,

02:19:16.000 --> 02:19:21.000
one of my personal highlights of the year 2000 to 2010 and so forth.

02:19:21.000 --> 02:19:23.000
Anyhow, we're going to call this our FUs of the Week.

02:19:23.000 --> 02:19:26.000
But in some regards, maybe this is the FUs of the Decade.

02:19:26.000 --> 02:19:27.000
I don't know.

02:19:27.000 --> 02:19:28.000
Here they are, the FUs of the Week.

02:19:43.000 --> 02:19:45.000
I actually do have an FU of the Week,

02:19:45.000 --> 02:19:51.000
which just goes to the TSA for putting in stricter ticket rules, I guess,

02:19:51.000 --> 02:19:54.000
where your name has to fully match.

02:19:54.000 --> 02:19:58.000
And my credit card information, when I buy my ticket,

02:19:58.000 --> 02:20:01.000
it's going to come up under my name as I have it listed for my billing information,

02:20:01.000 --> 02:20:04.000
which is not exactly how my name shows on my license.

02:20:04.000 --> 02:20:05.000
So yeah, annoying.

02:20:05.000 --> 02:20:07.000
But that's about it.

02:20:07.000 --> 02:20:11.000
And then as far as the year or the decade, I should say,

02:20:11.000 --> 02:20:17.000
the biggest FU has actually already happened, Rob.

02:20:17.000 --> 02:20:19.000
What's got disbarred?

02:20:19.000 --> 02:20:25.000
If that's not a ginormous FU, I don't know what is.

02:20:25.000 --> 02:20:26.000
All right, fair enough.

02:20:26.000 --> 02:20:29.000
Loki, what are your FUs of the Week and the Decade?

02:20:29.000 --> 02:20:32.000
I don't really know.

02:20:32.000 --> 02:20:40.000
I guess FU2, I don't really have anything.

02:20:40.000 --> 02:20:46.000
I guess FU2, myself, for not being able to play a lot of games during the holiday break,

02:20:46.000 --> 02:20:50.000
I think a lot of time I wasted trying to get games for my main cabinet,

02:20:50.000 --> 02:20:53.000
which I should just really play on the main cabinet,

02:20:53.000 --> 02:20:56.000
because I have, what, thousands of games on there already,

02:20:56.000 --> 02:20:58.000
and I haven't touched most of them.

02:20:58.000 --> 02:21:00.000
So why do I need more games?

02:21:00.000 --> 02:21:02.000
I know, because I need more of everything.

02:21:02.000 --> 02:21:05.000
That's why.

02:21:05.000 --> 02:21:10.000
And then the FU of the Decade goes to...

02:21:10.000 --> 02:21:12.000
God, I don't even know.

02:21:12.000 --> 02:21:14.000
That's tough to just nail down one thing.

02:21:14.000 --> 02:21:18.000
I guess...

02:21:18.000 --> 02:21:22.000
To Nintendo for disappointing us on a consistent basis.

02:21:22.000 --> 02:21:26.000
Hey, God damn it, embrace online!

02:21:26.000 --> 02:21:30.000
My FU of the Week, I don't know, I'm not super angsty.

02:21:30.000 --> 02:21:36.000
My FU of the Week goes to selfishness,

02:21:36.000 --> 02:21:40.000
because I think there's some selfish people out there I'm learning about,

02:21:40.000 --> 02:21:42.000
and I don't like it.

02:21:42.000 --> 02:21:48.000
My FU of the Decade goes to people that steal things that aren't theirs.

02:21:48.000 --> 02:21:52.000
You might remember this decade, my car was broken into a multitude of times.

02:21:52.000 --> 02:21:57.000
We had these people talking about stealing Xboxes and so forth

02:21:57.000 --> 02:22:01.000
that stupidly sign on to them online, stealing passwords

02:22:01.000 --> 02:22:03.000
and using them to hack people's accounts.

02:22:03.000 --> 02:22:08.000
FU to people that don't have the common decency to not touch shit that isn't theirs.

02:22:08.000 --> 02:22:12.000
Oh, and FU to Proposition 8, that was pretty fucked up too.

02:22:12.000 --> 02:22:14.000
Hey, back to the show.

02:22:14.000 --> 02:22:17.000
How about the segment of the show where we open up ye old mailbag

02:22:17.000 --> 02:22:19.000
and see what our listeners have to say?

02:22:19.000 --> 02:22:31.000
That would be at our mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com address.

02:22:31.000 --> 02:22:33.000
We have two emails.

02:22:33.000 --> 02:22:34.000
Alrighty.

02:22:34.000 --> 02:22:37.000
First one, hey, OLR, I was in Spanish class a few days ago

02:22:37.000 --> 02:22:39.000
and thinking about the new year.

02:22:39.000 --> 02:22:41.000
We should have been focusing on Spanish.

02:22:41.000 --> 02:22:44.000
Then I started thinking about really crappy games with peripherals

02:22:44.000 --> 02:22:47.000
that no one will buy like Band Hero and Tony Hawk Ride.

02:22:47.000 --> 02:22:51.000
So my question to you is what are your peripheral predictions for the new year?

02:22:51.000 --> 02:22:53.000
Personally, mine will be a knife and fork and stuff like that

02:22:53.000 --> 02:22:56.000
for a new Cooking Mama game.

02:22:56.000 --> 02:22:59.000
They've already done that actually.

02:22:59.000 --> 02:23:02.000
Well, you know, there's actually a burger flipping ticket game

02:23:02.000 --> 02:23:04.000
that came out in Japan.

02:23:04.000 --> 02:23:07.000
I think that we're going to get Boonga Boonga for the home

02:23:07.000 --> 02:23:10.000
and it comes with a real finger to butt peripheral.

02:23:10.000 --> 02:23:13.000
Whatever happened to the table flipping game that was out in Japan?

02:23:13.000 --> 02:23:14.000
I'd like to see that out of here.

02:23:14.000 --> 02:23:15.000
It's out in Japan. That's about it.

02:23:15.000 --> 02:23:16.000
What about here?

02:23:16.000 --> 02:23:24.000
I wonder if Boonga Boonga is actually emulated in MAME yet.

02:23:24.000 --> 02:23:26.000
Go get it. Go get it, Loki.

02:23:26.000 --> 02:23:32.000
Because if it is, that would be one hell of a fun game to make a peripheral for.

02:23:32.000 --> 02:23:34.000
Dot, dot, dot.

02:23:34.000 --> 02:23:38.000
As far as the rest of the email, what I think next year as far as peripherals go,

02:23:38.000 --> 02:23:40.000
you already know it's the motion sensing stuff.

02:23:40.000 --> 02:23:43.000
Natal and the ice cream cones from Sony.

02:23:43.000 --> 02:23:45.000
Those are going to be the huge things, game changers, that come out next year.

02:23:45.000 --> 02:23:49.000
They're also going to come out with the, I think,

02:23:49.000 --> 02:23:52.000
not just necessarily something that reads your motion,

02:23:52.000 --> 02:23:56.000
but also, you know, I would actually like to see something

02:23:56.000 --> 02:24:03.000
that doesn't necessarily view your motion as much as

02:24:03.000 --> 02:24:06.000
checks your coordination, you know what I mean?

02:24:06.000 --> 02:24:10.000
Like it gives you something like a full motion sensing DDR

02:24:10.000 --> 02:24:15.000
where it gives you your commands and then you have to mimic exactly.

02:24:15.000 --> 02:24:21.000
Or even, you know, or even charades online.

02:24:21.000 --> 02:24:22.000
Could you imagine that?

02:24:22.000 --> 02:24:23.000
You know what I don't want to see?

02:24:23.000 --> 02:24:25.000
That would be fun. I like that charades online idea.

02:24:25.000 --> 02:24:28.000
But what I don't want to see is this whole brain scanning thing.

02:24:28.000 --> 02:24:30.000
Have you heard about the brain devices?

02:24:30.000 --> 02:24:32.000
Like the game that you control with your brain and all this stuff?

02:24:32.000 --> 02:24:34.000
I don't like that idea.

02:24:34.000 --> 02:24:36.000
I don't like that at all.

02:24:36.000 --> 02:24:39.000
I hope that isn't where peripherals go next year.

02:24:39.000 --> 02:24:41.000
I just, I don't like the whole thought reading thing.

02:24:41.000 --> 02:24:44.000
It's kind of a little freaky to me.

02:24:44.000 --> 02:24:46.000
Call me a warrior or whatever.

02:24:46.000 --> 02:24:49.000
I just, you know, just a little weird.

02:24:49.000 --> 02:24:51.000
Anything else in the mail, Ag?

02:24:51.000 --> 02:24:53.000
Yes. Well, there's still more to that one.

02:24:53.000 --> 02:24:54.000
Oh, my bad.

02:24:54.000 --> 02:24:56.000
Yeah, Rob, duh.

02:24:56.000 --> 02:24:58.000
Sorry, I have to give you a hard time.

02:24:58.000 --> 02:25:00.000
As soon as I can find where the crap my thing went to.

02:25:00.000 --> 02:25:02.000
There we go.

02:25:02.000 --> 02:25:05.000
Also, I wondered where you guys get your news from.

02:25:05.000 --> 02:25:07.000
Do you have a set or are you all over the place?

02:25:07.000 --> 02:25:12.000
My favorite right now is games with a Z traffic dot com.

02:25:12.000 --> 02:25:14.000
Look it up. Thanks, Mike.

02:25:14.000 --> 02:25:16.000
I think you just gave somebody a free plug.

02:25:16.000 --> 02:25:18.000
Why not? I don't mind.

02:25:18.000 --> 02:25:19.000
Alright.

02:25:19.000 --> 02:25:21.000
You know, I go Eurogamer for a lot of my stuff.

02:25:21.000 --> 02:25:25.000
I use Google Reader and I feed several different websites into Google Reader.

02:25:25.000 --> 02:25:27.000
You know why Google Reader is awesome?

02:25:27.000 --> 02:25:32.000
Because, like, anybody that tries to firewall access to certain sites at certain places,

02:25:32.000 --> 02:25:34.000
Google Reader gets around that.

02:25:34.000 --> 02:25:36.000
Yes.

02:25:36.000 --> 02:25:38.000
Also, another one.

02:25:38.000 --> 02:25:40.000
Hi, everyone.

02:25:40.000 --> 02:25:42.000
This is from Spazinator, by the way.

02:25:42.000 --> 02:25:45.000
Hi, everyone. Seeing as this is topics and questions may possibly run a little long,

02:25:45.000 --> 02:25:48.000
I opted to send them via email rather than Twitter.

02:25:48.000 --> 02:25:52.000
Seeing as it's the end of the year and traditionally everyone seemingly does a top ten list of some sort,

02:25:52.000 --> 02:25:55.000
why not have the O.L. Army do one?

02:25:55.000 --> 02:25:57.000
But do one with a twist.

02:25:57.000 --> 02:26:03.000
What I had in mind was a list of top games that came out this year that you love to have

02:26:03.000 --> 02:26:08.000
the Hillary Clintons and the Voldemorts of the world be forced to play nonstop for days on end

02:26:08.000 --> 02:26:09.000
just to drive them all crazy.

02:26:09.000 --> 02:26:11.000
Well, even crazier than they already happen to be.

02:26:11.000 --> 02:26:14.000
Also, seeing as the year is virtually over, I have two questions.

02:26:14.000 --> 02:26:18.000
Compared to 2008, how do you feel about 2009 fared in regards to game releases,

02:26:18.000 --> 02:26:22.000
sales of both consoles and games, as well as improvements to consoles,

02:26:22.000 --> 02:26:26.000
and or their online services, both in terms of actual hardware revisions,

02:26:26.000 --> 02:26:30.000
or as well as firmware updates.

02:26:30.000 --> 02:26:34.000
I have no opinion. It's about the same.

02:26:34.000 --> 02:26:38.000
I've got to say, I think 09 has been a lot more disappointing than 08.

02:26:38.000 --> 02:26:40.000
I think we've had a lot of disappointments this year.

02:26:40.000 --> 02:26:44.000
Games getting pushed back, quality of games, you know, don't seem to be up there.

02:26:44.000 --> 02:26:47.000
I mean, there's lots of exceptions to this rule, don't get me wrong.

02:26:47.000 --> 02:26:49.000
Of course, there's been some real gems that have been released this year,

02:26:49.000 --> 02:26:53.000
but I think layoffs, et cetera, it's been a lot of disappointment this year.

02:26:53.000 --> 02:26:57.000
I don't think there's a lot of good that came out of this year.

02:26:57.000 --> 02:27:03.000
Except for, yeah, I got nothing.

02:27:03.000 --> 02:27:06.000
President Cat is the good thing that came out this year, that's it.

02:27:06.000 --> 02:27:09.000
Two, and as far as 2010 is concerned,

02:27:09.000 --> 02:27:12.000
is there anything in particular that's been announced that you three are eagerly awaiting?

02:27:12.000 --> 02:27:15.000
Do you have any possible predictions for 2010?

02:27:15.000 --> 02:27:17.000
Or at least something you hope to see happen?

02:27:17.000 --> 02:27:22.000
I hope that we get President Cat.

02:27:22.000 --> 02:27:27.000
To kind of piggyback on what Loki was ranting about earlier,

02:27:27.000 --> 02:27:29.000
I would really like to see Nintendo come out at E3

02:27:29.000 --> 02:27:32.000
and do the system they should have done last time.

02:27:32.000 --> 02:27:38.000
I understand that Wii was their gamble, yay for them, they won.

02:27:38.000 --> 02:27:40.000
I would like to see them kind of take that up to the next level

02:27:40.000 --> 02:27:43.000
and catch up finally to where their competitors are at

02:27:43.000 --> 02:27:45.000
as far as the hardcore gamers are concerned,

02:27:45.000 --> 02:27:48.000
with the HD and the online and all that fun stuff.

02:27:48.000 --> 02:27:54.000
It's not going to happen, but you asked what I want to see.

02:27:54.000 --> 02:27:57.000
And I'm always a big fan of more retro goodness,

02:27:57.000 --> 02:28:00.000
so I would like to see more retro games coming back,

02:28:00.000 --> 02:28:04.000
this whole achievements and trophies and cooperative online play.

02:28:04.000 --> 02:28:06.000
I'm a big fan of all that stuff.

02:28:06.000 --> 02:28:11.000
I wish the Virtual Console had achievements within it,

02:28:11.000 --> 02:28:15.000
or ways that I could experience all these old games again with friends.

02:28:15.000 --> 02:28:20.000
As neat as Virtual Console is for some of the great retro games,

02:28:20.000 --> 02:28:22.000
it feels very lazy to me.

02:28:22.000 --> 02:28:26.000
It's just an emulator you're paying for.

02:28:26.000 --> 02:28:30.000
And to be fair, Xbox 360 has a lot of these games in their arcade, too.

02:28:30.000 --> 02:28:32.000
I'm not just picking on Nintendo here.

02:28:32.000 --> 02:28:34.000
A lot of arcade releases on 360,

02:28:34.000 --> 02:28:36.000
and Microsoft finally put their foot down on this,

02:28:36.000 --> 02:28:40.000
was just retro stuff that would throw in some achievements.

02:28:40.000 --> 02:28:42.000
I don't know, I just would like to see retro games.

02:28:42.000 --> 02:28:43.000
It has been a decent year for retro gaming.

02:28:43.000 --> 02:28:46.000
I think it has been a decent year, though, for retro gaming already.

02:28:46.000 --> 02:28:48.000
Because we've gotten certainly a lot of nods,

02:28:48.000 --> 02:28:51.000
I mean, Bionic Commando, and...

02:28:51.000 --> 02:28:55.000
You know, I really, though, want to see something really innovative.

02:28:55.000 --> 02:28:57.000
I want to see something really original.

02:28:57.000 --> 02:28:59.000
I want to see a game.

02:28:59.000 --> 02:29:02.000
I want to see working designs come back,

02:29:02.000 --> 02:29:04.000
and bring out all the cool stuff from Japan.

02:29:04.000 --> 02:29:06.000
That's what I want.

02:29:06.000 --> 02:29:09.000
I'm holding my breath.

02:29:09.000 --> 02:29:12.000
Is that it for that email?

02:29:12.000 --> 02:29:13.000
Or is there more?

02:29:13.000 --> 02:29:15.000
I think that's it.

02:29:15.000 --> 02:29:16.000
All right.

02:29:16.000 --> 02:29:17.000
Yeah, that's it.

02:29:17.000 --> 02:29:20.000
Mailbag at Orangelaunchrater.com is the place to send your emails.

02:29:20.000 --> 02:29:23.000
Now we'll get into the decade a little bit,

02:29:23.000 --> 02:29:26.000
and I don't want to linger too long on this,

02:29:26.000 --> 02:29:29.000
but it's interesting that we're getting to the close of another decade here,

02:29:29.000 --> 02:29:33.000
the O's or whatever we're going to end up calling these in the past.

02:29:33.000 --> 02:29:35.000
If you think about it, it started.

02:29:35.000 --> 02:29:38.000
Let me just rewind ten years ago here,

02:29:38.000 --> 02:29:44.000
and I realize the majority of our listeners are somewhere between 18 and 25,

02:29:44.000 --> 02:29:48.000
meaning when this decade started, you were between 8 and 15.

02:29:48.000 --> 02:29:52.000
So, I mean, games have kind of evolved with many of you,

02:29:52.000 --> 02:29:54.000
and of course, not all of our listeners.

02:29:54.000 --> 02:29:57.000
Heck, the hosts don't fit into that age bracket.

02:29:57.000 --> 02:30:00.000
I'm considerably older than that, as we all are,

02:30:00.000 --> 02:30:04.000
but I realize that that's where a lot of the listener base is,

02:30:04.000 --> 02:30:06.000
and just how much games have changed.

02:30:06.000 --> 02:30:09.000
Just to kind of rewind ten years and show you how far we've come.

02:30:09.000 --> 02:30:14.000
Here are some of the big things that happened in the year 2000.

02:30:14.000 --> 02:30:18.000
PlayStation 2 was launched in the year 2000.

02:30:18.000 --> 02:30:21.000
That's when the PlayStation 2 came out.

02:30:21.000 --> 02:30:25.000
Let's see.

02:30:25.000 --> 02:30:30.000
Nintendo finally sold its 100th millionth Game Boy handheld console.

02:30:30.000 --> 02:30:34.000
Sega launched Sega Net into the year 2000,

02:30:34.000 --> 02:30:38.000
and that's when the Dreamcast Championships took off.

02:30:38.000 --> 02:30:41.000
Some of the games that came out in the year 2000.

02:30:41.000 --> 02:30:44.000
The Sims came out January 31st of the year 2000.

02:30:44.000 --> 02:30:46.000
I think it was almost ten years old.

02:30:46.000 --> 02:30:49.000
Thief 2 came out in the year 2000.

02:30:49.000 --> 02:30:51.000
Vagrant Story.

02:30:51.000 --> 02:30:54.000
EverQuest came out in the year 2000.

02:30:54.000 --> 02:30:56.000
Deus Ex.

02:30:56.000 --> 02:30:59.000
Diablo 2 was from the year 2000.

02:30:59.000 --> 02:31:01.000
That game feels even older.

02:31:01.000 --> 02:31:05.000
Final Fantasy IX had a release in Japan in the year 2000.

02:31:05.000 --> 02:31:07.000
Chrono Cross came out in 2000.

02:31:07.000 --> 02:31:10.000
Dragon Quest VII.

02:31:10.000 --> 02:31:14.000
American McGee's Alice.

02:31:14.000 --> 02:31:18.000
The Legend of Zelda Majora's Mask was in the year 2000.

02:31:18.000 --> 02:31:21.000
What else we also had that year?

02:31:21.000 --> 02:31:23.000
Seaman.

02:31:23.000 --> 02:31:25.000
Was that really?

02:31:25.000 --> 02:31:29.000
Seaman, do they have a lot of Dreamcast stuff on there?

02:31:29.000 --> 02:31:32.000
Yeah, they account for Dreamcast on this list.

02:31:32.000 --> 02:31:37.000
I think Seaman might have either been 2000 or 2001.

02:31:37.000 --> 02:31:40.000
But yeah, the Dreamcast stuff was all early.

02:31:40.000 --> 02:31:42.000
Escape from Monkey Island.

02:31:42.000 --> 02:31:44.000
Tekken Tag Tournament.

02:31:44.000 --> 02:31:47.000
Final Fantasy IX got its release over here too.

02:31:47.000 --> 02:31:49.000
Skies of Arcadia.

02:31:49.000 --> 02:31:51.000
Banjo-Tooie.

02:31:51.000 --> 02:31:52.000
Here's some Dreamcast.

02:31:52.000 --> 02:31:55.000
Grandia 2 came out towards the end of the year 2000.

02:31:55.000 --> 02:31:57.000
Grandia 2, I played a lot of that.

02:31:57.000 --> 02:32:01.000
I played through half of it in Japanese and then I was actually...

02:32:01.000 --> 02:32:06.000
That's one of the games that I found out that my Japanese save file worked on the US one.

02:32:06.000 --> 02:32:08.000
You know what else game did that?

02:32:08.000 --> 02:32:10.000
Power Stone.

02:32:10.000 --> 02:32:12.000
Wow.

02:32:12.000 --> 02:32:13.000
So, think about it.

02:32:13.000 --> 02:32:14.000
I mean, just to kind of go all the way back.

02:32:14.000 --> 02:32:19.000
Ten years ago we were a completely different generation of video games.

02:32:19.000 --> 02:32:24.000
Because the launch of the new generation, if you will, of games didn't really happen until...

02:32:24.000 --> 02:32:26.000
What about 2005, 2006?

02:32:26.000 --> 02:32:30.000
I think E3 is when we started hearing about this new round of consoles.

02:32:30.000 --> 02:32:31.000
And then you go back.

02:32:31.000 --> 02:32:35.000
I mean, heck, the GameCube just came out in, what, like 01?

02:32:35.000 --> 02:32:36.000
Now we have the Wii.

02:32:36.000 --> 02:32:40.000
I mean, we've gone through many, many different game systems in this generation.

02:32:40.000 --> 02:32:44.000
So we would have had that all touched this last ten years.

02:32:44.000 --> 02:32:51.000
We had the Dreamcast, the PlayStation 2, the PlayStation 3, the GameCube, the Wii, the Xbox.

02:32:51.000 --> 02:32:55.000
Microsoft got into gaming in these past few years, or not even ten years ago.

02:32:55.000 --> 02:32:57.000
And the Xbox 360.

02:32:57.000 --> 02:33:00.000
And then, of course, I'm not even counting handhelds and the countless amounts of those.

02:33:00.000 --> 02:33:04.000
And, you know, other one-off systems that came out as well.

02:33:04.000 --> 02:33:07.000
So it's going to be interesting, you know, in the next ten years, in the next generation,

02:33:07.000 --> 02:33:11.000
just how far games go will probably be another generation.

02:33:11.000 --> 02:33:14.000
We'll be talking about the PlayStation 4 and other Xboxes.

02:33:14.000 --> 02:33:18.000
And maybe other companies that decide to get into gaming.

02:33:18.000 --> 02:33:20.000
Or maybe one of these companies will buy another.

02:33:20.000 --> 02:33:21.000
Who knows?

02:33:21.000 --> 02:33:23.000
It's going to be very interesting to see what happens.

02:33:23.000 --> 02:33:27.000
Before we open up the phone calls, and yes, some folks in chat want to point out,

02:33:27.000 --> 02:33:29.000
OLR started in 2002.

02:33:29.000 --> 02:33:35.000
So while we didn't exist ten years ago, we're getting into our eighth year of broadcasting.

02:33:35.000 --> 02:33:36.000
That's quite some time.

02:33:36.000 --> 02:33:39.000
It's pretty impressive.

02:33:39.000 --> 02:33:40.000
What do you guys think?

02:33:40.000 --> 02:33:42.000
And I know this is a very difficult question.

02:33:42.000 --> 02:33:44.000
This is a very difficult question.

02:33:44.000 --> 02:33:49.000
But what do you guys think were some of the best games to come out of the decade?

02:33:49.000 --> 02:33:52.000
The best games to come out of all freaking decade.

02:33:52.000 --> 02:33:55.000
Knowing that you have all of those systems available to you.

02:33:55.000 --> 02:34:00.000
Not just maybe what was important to you, but what you think was important to gaming in general.

02:34:00.000 --> 02:34:02.000
The decade.

02:34:02.000 --> 02:34:05.000
Loki, do you want to start? Do you have anything?

02:34:08.000 --> 02:34:11.000
DDR Max 2 in the arcade.

02:34:11.000 --> 02:34:12.000
Why is that?

02:34:12.000 --> 02:34:14.000
It was fun.

02:34:14.000 --> 02:34:18.000
It got people back in the arcade because you had stuff that you were working to unlock.

02:34:18.000 --> 02:34:19.000
I don't know.

02:34:19.000 --> 02:34:22.000
I like 5th Mix too. That came out around the same.

02:34:22.000 --> 02:34:25.000
These were also games that brought us together.

02:34:25.000 --> 02:34:26.000
We wouldn't have OLR.

02:34:26.000 --> 02:34:31.000
As much shit as we give Konami and their music division now, ten years ago was a different story.

02:34:31.000 --> 02:34:33.000
We praised them. We loved them.

02:34:33.000 --> 02:34:36.000
But they made a lot of mistakes, sadly.

02:34:36.000 --> 02:34:38.000
That it? Anything on consoles you want to mention?

02:34:38.000 --> 02:34:39.000
Oh yeah, of course.

02:34:39.000 --> 02:34:43.000
Like Grand Theft Auto, I want to say 3 I think was around that time.

02:34:43.000 --> 02:34:46.000
I know definitely San Andreas was around that time.

02:34:46.000 --> 02:34:50.000
And those are pretty significant.

02:34:50.000 --> 02:34:54.000
Other things I played that were really fun, let me think.

02:35:00.000 --> 02:35:04.000
I like Marvel vs. Capcom 2, but I can't remember when that came out.

02:35:04.000 --> 02:35:06.000
I think that was around that time.

02:35:09.000 --> 02:35:12.000
Gosh, I don't know. There's a lot of stuff I played.

02:35:12.000 --> 02:35:16.000
It's hard to think back ten years. Everything I think about is more recent.

02:35:16.000 --> 02:35:19.000
Final Fantasy X was pretty good.

02:35:19.000 --> 02:35:20.000
Yeah, that was important.

02:35:20.000 --> 02:35:21.000
That was pretty important.

02:35:21.000 --> 02:35:23.000
11 for you. You spent a lot of time on that one.

02:35:23.000 --> 02:35:25.000
I spent a lot of time on 11. That was fun.

02:35:25.000 --> 02:35:27.000
First MMO?

02:35:27.000 --> 02:35:32.000
Well, I played a little of my jerks online, but that sucked.

02:35:35.000 --> 02:35:37.000
Gosh, yeah, it's tough.

02:35:37.000 --> 02:35:43.000
Dark Sakura, anything you want to throw out there as far as your games of the decade?

02:35:43.000 --> 02:35:46.000
Portal? Definitely Portal.

02:35:46.000 --> 02:35:48.000
Seaman.

02:35:48.000 --> 02:35:50.000
DDR?

02:35:50.000 --> 02:35:56.000
Well, keep in mind, I got DDR for home in 2000 on Dreamcast.

02:35:56.000 --> 02:35:59.000
Rod Caliber Rob.

02:35:59.000 --> 02:36:01.000
Rod Caliber is important.

02:36:01.000 --> 02:36:03.000
You remember Rod Caliber, don't you?

02:36:03.000 --> 02:36:06.000
Yes, that's when you play Soul Caliber with the rod.

02:36:06.000 --> 02:36:09.000
Yeah, exactly. Rod Caliber.

02:36:09.000 --> 02:36:21.000
Also, I'd have to say, probably as far as shooters go, I'd say Ikaruga, getting Gradius 5.

02:36:21.000 --> 02:36:25.000
There was a lot of good games that came out, though, in the decade.

02:36:25.000 --> 02:36:28.000
So, I'd really say...

02:36:28.000 --> 02:36:34.000
Well, if I say Portal, I should say Nurbacular Drop, because that's really the game that gave us Portal.

02:36:34.000 --> 02:36:41.000
A lot of people thinking in interesting directions, especially with having the Dreamcast come out, the Naomi system, Hikaru after that.

02:36:41.000 --> 02:36:45.000
Although, I still want Planet Harrier. Where is it?

02:36:45.000 --> 02:36:49.000
It doesn't work. I tried it during the beginning of the show.

02:36:49.000 --> 02:36:50.000
Damn!

02:36:50.000 --> 02:36:53.000
Sorry, it still doesn't work in MAME.

02:36:53.000 --> 02:37:00.000
As far as my answer to the question, I've answered this on another show, but to kind of repeat it here on Orange Launch Radio, I think I would split it up into a few categories.

02:37:00.000 --> 02:37:01.000
Me and Skype?

02:37:01.000 --> 02:37:03.000
No, you left yourself on.

02:37:03.000 --> 02:37:04.000
Sorry.

02:37:04.000 --> 02:37:08.000
Jamie's trying to have a sidebar conversation with me while I'm trying to talk on the internet.

02:37:08.000 --> 02:37:13.000
Anyhow, what was I going to say? Oh yes, the game of the decade. Some things that came up.

02:37:13.000 --> 02:37:21.000
My personal favorite game of the decade, I think, was probably Animal Crossing, was one I really remember.

02:37:21.000 --> 02:37:24.000
I loved how you...

02:37:24.000 --> 02:37:32.000
As much slack as that game got for running around doing nothing, if you really went far with it, where you could go into somebody else's village...

02:37:32.000 --> 02:37:36.000
You brought your friend over with a memory card, and I remember we used to do this shit all the time.

02:37:36.000 --> 02:37:41.000
Somebody would come over and we'd visit the town and try to get their townspeople to say dirty words and all this stuff.

02:37:41.000 --> 02:37:47.000
It was just a lot of fun. And also the fact that it had all the retro Nintendo games in it before Nintendo started gouging the prices for all this stuff.

02:37:47.000 --> 02:37:55.000
I just loved that game when it first came out, and it kind of sucks that the game's franchise has been milked through the DS and the Wii versions.

02:37:55.000 --> 02:37:57.000
It's just not really as fun anymore as it used to be.

02:37:57.000 --> 02:38:06.000
But that very first Animal Crossing that was on the GameCube in America, yes, I realize it's based off a Nintendo 64 game, but I'm not counting that because I didn't have an impact on our culture here in the US.

02:38:06.000 --> 02:38:12.000
That first Animal Crossing on the GameCube, I think, was probably one of the best gaming experiences I had all decade.

02:38:12.000 --> 02:38:23.000
As far as on a technical level, I know Loki's gonna kind of hate me for this, but I think Wii Sports, you have to recognize, is one of the best games of the decade because it got people to play games who don't play games.

02:38:23.000 --> 02:38:27.000
You see Wii Sports in nursing homes, for Christ's sake.

02:38:27.000 --> 02:38:29.000
But we didn't want those people playing games!

02:38:29.000 --> 02:38:35.000
You still have to recognize, though, that's still money in the gaming industry that can someday make a game you might want to play.

02:38:35.000 --> 02:38:41.000
No, it won't, because they'll be catering to these people that don't really care about games, but they like Wii Sports.

02:38:41.000 --> 02:38:52.000
Okay, okay, hold on. But without Wii Sports, and basically the Wii in general, would we have Project Natal and the Sony ice cream cones, which may bring us the games you want to play, Loki?

02:38:52.000 --> 02:38:55.000
I'm still skeptical on what they're gonna bring out.

02:38:55.000 --> 02:39:00.000
I'm skeptical too, but there is a possibility it could be pretty fucking awesome.

02:39:00.000 --> 02:39:04.000
And we would have Wii Sports to thank for that, like it or not.

02:39:04.000 --> 02:39:11.000
Let's see, also I would say probably a good combination of both of those, both just personal favorite and I think it did a lot for gaming.

02:39:11.000 --> 02:39:20.000
World of Warcraft. Haters gonna hate. I know there's a lot of people that are anti-MMOs out there, but I think World of Warcraft did amazing stuff for online games.

02:39:20.000 --> 02:39:28.000
I think just for all, I think the way Blizzard kind of caters to the different audiences, Blizzard is like the best PC game maker.

02:39:28.000 --> 02:39:36.000
They are. They don't make, name a bad Blizzard game.

02:39:36.000 --> 02:39:49.000
I don't think there is one. Like maybe if you want to go back to like the Lost Vikings or shit that was out like years and years ago, but Blizzard, and to be fair, Blizzard doesn't make a lot of games, but World of Warcraft was great.

02:39:49.000 --> 02:39:56.000
And they continue to make it better and the expansions have been good and I mean 11 million people play this game and sometimes people you wouldn't expect.

02:39:56.000 --> 02:40:01.000
It's kind of created this whole new culture. It's been parodied on South Park and so forth.

02:40:01.000 --> 02:40:03.000
Which was a very funny episode.

02:40:03.000 --> 02:40:09.000
Yes, it was a very funny episode. I saw this list on Yahoo and I actually thought it was not a bad compilation.

02:40:09.000 --> 02:40:17.000
A lot of times I roll my eyes at these sites when they want to do a top 10 games of the decade, but I actually think Yahoo did a decent job.

02:40:17.000 --> 02:40:24.000
I wanted to share this with you guys. Again, this is coming from videogames.yahoo.com. This was their picks for the top 10 of the decade.

02:40:24.000 --> 02:40:32.000
Number 10 from the year 2007, Super Mario Galaxy. I know Loki is a big fan of that, so Super Mario Galaxy from 2007.

02:40:32.000 --> 02:40:36.000
That's alright. I'm just saying Super Mario Galaxy 2 is not going to be that great.

02:40:36.000 --> 02:40:39.000
Number 9, Half Life 2.

02:40:39.000 --> 02:40:40.000
Definitely.

02:40:40.000 --> 02:40:48.000
I think sometimes I've forgotten about game from all of us console hoarding folks, but the orange box did bring this back to the forefront.

02:40:48.000 --> 02:40:51.000
Half Life 2 is a hugely important PC game.

02:40:51.000 --> 02:41:01.000
Just for the way it integrated story into the shooter game and the graphical level and just the fact that the game, you didn't really go from level to level.

02:41:01.000 --> 02:41:03.000
You were immersed in the game.

02:41:03.000 --> 02:41:07.000
I think it did a lot for gaming in that regard. That's a pretty good pick.

02:41:07.000 --> 02:41:11.000
Some folks will probably put that a lot higher on their list. I don't know, but they put it in number 9.

02:41:11.000 --> 02:41:16.000
Again, this list is coming from Yahoo video games and they write little blurbs with each of these I'm not going to read.

02:41:16.000 --> 02:41:20.000
Wii Fit they put on their list in the year 2007.

02:41:20.000 --> 02:41:23.000
This is the only one I take a little bit of issue with. I get why it's here.

02:41:23.000 --> 02:41:29.000
They're putting this here for the same reason I named Wii Sports earlier because it opened up gaming to people that wouldn't usually play games.

02:41:29.000 --> 02:41:36.000
But is it a game or is it something that uses a game console to accomplish what it really wants to do? I don't know.

02:41:36.000 --> 02:41:43.000
I like this entry. I think this is often overlooked. Number 7, Bejeweled from the year 2001. The original Bejeweled.

02:41:43.000 --> 02:41:44.000
I can see that.

02:41:44.000 --> 02:41:51.000
I can totally see that too and I think a lot of folks forget what PopCap and casual gaming has done for gaming in this decade.

02:41:51.000 --> 02:41:53.000
I think that's a very important game to note.

02:41:53.000 --> 02:41:57.000
Number 6, they put Wii Sports. I don't think I need to say anything else with that.

02:41:57.000 --> 02:42:00.000
Number 5, they put Halo.

02:42:00.000 --> 02:42:04.000
I don't think the Xbox would have survived if it wasn't for Halo.

02:42:04.000 --> 02:42:08.000
I think we'd be looking at the Xbox kind of like we look at the Atari Jaguar, honestly.

02:42:08.000 --> 02:42:16.000
I think Xbox kind of pushed, and especially Halo 2, kind of pushed the Xbox to what ended up happening on the 360.

02:42:16.000 --> 02:42:21.000
I think Halo was huge.

02:42:21.000 --> 02:42:25.000
And certainly Yahoo and their video game related site does too.

02:42:25.000 --> 02:42:30.000
You know Rob, it's all about Pest Society and Farmville.

02:42:30.000 --> 02:42:34.000
And number 4 was Guitar Hero they put on the list.

02:42:34.000 --> 02:42:41.000
And it's very interesting having done this as a music game based show when it was a very niche thing.

02:42:41.000 --> 02:42:48.000
It's very interesting that we have kind of watched music games explode into the mainstream and a lot of this is because of Guitar Hero.

02:42:48.000 --> 02:42:53.000
And they finally did what Konami should have thought to do a long fucking time ago.

02:42:53.000 --> 02:43:00.000
Or excuse me, what Konami of Japan should have taken a risk on a long time ago and stopped being so bullheaded when it comes to releasing stuff in the US.

02:43:00.000 --> 02:43:03.000
And that is put in the songs that people in the US want to play.

02:43:03.000 --> 02:43:11.000
And granted, I know those of us here in studio and a lot of our long time listeners were fans of stuff that Konami was putting in those music games a long time ago.

02:43:11.000 --> 02:43:15.000
But we were a niche audience and those games were never going to break through.

02:43:15.000 --> 02:43:18.000
Guitar Hero finally broke it through and I think that's important to note.

02:43:18.000 --> 02:43:21.000
And it debuted in our living room, in my living room.

02:43:21.000 --> 02:43:24.000
That's right, you guys had like a sneak peek.

02:43:24.000 --> 02:43:28.000
I wasn't here that day but you and Loki were on the news doing some sneak peek thing with Guitar Hero.

02:43:28.000 --> 02:43:29.000
I remember that, that was cool.

02:43:29.000 --> 02:43:30.000
That was pretty fun.

02:43:30.000 --> 02:43:37.000
Just because I happen to have a big TV that wouldn't, you know, had a better refresh rate.

02:43:37.000 --> 02:43:42.000
I just want to point out a lot of our chatters because I'm kind of keeping one eye on chat.orangelandrado.com.

02:43:42.000 --> 02:43:43.000
So some interesting comments.

02:43:43.000 --> 02:43:47.000
GameGuru, Half Life 2 also introduced Steam onto the world.

02:43:47.000 --> 02:43:49.000
That was the first one that had Steam in it.

02:43:49.000 --> 02:43:53.000
And then quite a few folks yelling out PEGAL better than Bejeweled.

02:43:53.000 --> 02:43:54.000
I love PEGAL.

02:43:54.000 --> 02:43:55.000
I do love PEGAL too.

02:43:55.000 --> 02:43:56.000
Especially on iPhone.

02:43:56.000 --> 02:43:58.000
But I think without Bejeweled you wouldn't have PEGAL.

02:43:58.000 --> 02:44:00.000
So I can see why they opted to put PEGAL on the list.

02:44:00.000 --> 02:44:08.000
Well I mean, shoot, without Tetris or Puzzle Bobble we wouldn't have, without Plinko we wouldn't have PEGAL.

02:44:08.000 --> 02:44:13.000
The number three game on Yahoo's list, The Sims, was the most important game of the decade.

02:44:13.000 --> 02:44:16.000
And you know what, I think The Sims was pretty fucking awesome.

02:44:16.000 --> 02:44:19.000
It was the best PC selling game for a long time.

02:44:19.000 --> 02:44:22.000
It might still be with all those expansions, I'm not sure.

02:44:22.000 --> 02:44:28.000
But the number two game is another PC game, World of Warcraft, they put on their list for pretty much the same reasons I did.

02:44:28.000 --> 02:44:31.000
So number one game, any guesses?

02:44:31.000 --> 02:44:34.000
Big trendy things that haven't been named yet for the game of the decade?

02:44:34.000 --> 02:44:36.000
Modern Warfare 2.

02:44:36.000 --> 02:44:37.000
It's game of the decade?

02:44:37.000 --> 02:44:39.000
Yep, they're going to do that.

02:44:39.000 --> 02:44:40.000
Okay.

02:44:40.000 --> 02:44:44.000
Uh, I got nothing.

02:44:44.000 --> 02:44:47.000
Grand Theft Auto 3 they named as the number one game of the decade, Grand Theft Auto 3.

02:44:47.000 --> 02:44:50.000
As it rightly should be.

02:44:50.000 --> 02:44:51.000
From 2001.

02:44:51.000 --> 02:44:53.000
I thought they would punk out and go.

02:44:53.000 --> 02:44:59.000
No, I mean, Grand Theft Auto 3 was really the first sandbox-y type of game like that, right?

02:44:59.000 --> 02:45:04.000
And just opened up this whole new type of video game, practically.

02:45:04.000 --> 02:45:12.000
I have to admit, usually I look at those lists and roll my eyes, but maybe with the exception of Wii Fit, that was a pretty good list, I gotta say.

02:45:12.000 --> 02:45:14.000
Let's see what you guys think about there.

02:45:14.000 --> 02:45:16.000
Some of our folks in chat disagree.

02:45:16.000 --> 02:45:23.000
I don't know though, I realize Grand Theft Auto 3 might not be the type of game you play, but think about that whole sandbox type of game.

02:45:23.000 --> 02:45:28.000
I mean, Grand Theft Auto was really kind of the pioneer in that, and I think without Grand Theft Auto 3 you wouldn't have that.

02:45:28.000 --> 02:45:36.000
Anyhow, we're going to go ahead and open up our Skype line and see what you guys have to say about the year in gaming and the decade in gaming.

02:45:36.000 --> 02:45:38.000
And honestly, it's just an open forum tonight.

02:45:38.000 --> 02:45:44.000
Whatever you guys want to talk about, it's our last show of the decade, so please give us a call.

02:45:44.000 --> 02:45:54.000
1-877-GAME-OLR is the number to call, or you can always reach us on Skype at username ORANGELOUNGERADIO is the place to call.

02:45:54.000 --> 02:45:59.000
Meanwhile, while we wait for some calls to come in, do we have any last minute stories, Loki?

02:45:59.000 --> 02:46:02.000
I haven't been looking at last minute stories.

02:46:02.000 --> 02:46:04.000
Yeah, I'm sure we do have some.

02:46:04.000 --> 02:46:08.000
Oh good, you're saved because we have a call coming in right now, so let's go ahead and take this call.

02:46:08.000 --> 02:46:11.000
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?

02:46:11.000 --> 02:46:12.000
Hi, this is HackDeft.

02:46:12.000 --> 02:46:14.000
Hi HackDeft, how you doing?

02:46:14.000 --> 02:46:15.000
Pretty good.

02:46:15.000 --> 02:46:21.000
Well, we're talking about, of course, the year in games, the decade in games, or really whatever you want to talk about tonight. What's on your mind?

02:46:21.000 --> 02:46:28.000
Well, first of all, I want to wish you a Merry Christmas, a late Merry Christmas, and a Happy New Year.

02:46:28.000 --> 02:46:30.000
Same to you?

02:46:30.000 --> 02:46:31.000
Thanks.

02:46:31.000 --> 02:46:34.000
And I want to talk about my game of the year.

02:46:34.000 --> 02:46:35.000
Which is?

02:46:35.000 --> 02:46:36.000
Possibly.

02:46:36.000 --> 02:46:38.000
Forza Motorsport 3.

02:46:38.000 --> 02:46:44.000
Ah, okay. That hasn't been mentioned yet on the show, but I can see that as somebody's choice.

02:46:44.000 --> 02:46:47.000
What is it about this game that makes it the game of the year for you?

02:46:47.000 --> 02:46:55.000
I can explain it in only one phrase. It's racing simulation for dummies.

02:46:55.000 --> 02:47:02.000
And why does that make it game of the year? I mean, Mario Kart Wii is kind of racing simulation for dummies, right?

02:47:02.000 --> 02:47:18.000
Well, Mario Kart Wii is more like an arcade style of racing, while Forza is more of a simulation like Gran Turismo, where if you make a bad turn, you will crash.

02:47:18.000 --> 02:47:23.000
If you go too fast, you'll crash, and if you do everything wrong, you'll crash.

02:47:23.000 --> 02:47:43.000
And not like in Gran Turismo or any other racing game, your car has damages, and possibly, well, not possibly, and it will affect your racing.

02:47:43.000 --> 02:47:52.000
Is it just the realism in that regard that makes this the game of the year for you, or is it like a graphical achievement, or what is it that just makes this game so awesome?

02:47:52.000 --> 02:48:04.000
Everything. It has the graphics, it has the gameplay, it has the online, it has everything you can ask in a game, it has it in racing form.

02:48:04.000 --> 02:48:11.000
Like, the online community, I haven't played that much online, but it's good, and it has a lot of options.

02:48:11.000 --> 02:48:23.000
You can customize your car in tuning, you can paint it, you can make stickers or decals, and make your own car.

02:48:23.000 --> 02:48:28.000
It's like the teddy bear workshop, but in car form.

02:48:28.000 --> 02:48:49.000
And like I said, it's a pretty easy game to pick up, because the options let you begin to play, you have a lot of things that help you to race along and complete the challenges and all the tournaments and races you have to compete in.

02:48:49.000 --> 02:48:59.000
But if you're truly a racing expert, it also has all that other stuff that makes you like the game.

02:48:59.000 --> 02:49:02.000
It makes a real simulation.

02:49:02.000 --> 02:49:09.000
Alright, well the only criteria that you really have to use is the type of game that you enjoy, it's just your criteria and no one else's.

02:49:09.000 --> 02:49:12.000
So if that's your game of the year, then so be it.

02:49:12.000 --> 02:49:15.000
Well, we appreciate the call and you chiming in on your game of the year.

02:49:15.000 --> 02:49:17.000
Are there any other quick thoughts you have for us tonight?

02:49:17.000 --> 02:49:25.000
Well, other than that, I think that also Street Fighter IV is also a candidate for game of the year.

02:49:25.000 --> 02:49:28.000
A game that will offer you as a studio name.

02:49:28.000 --> 02:49:33.000
How do you say it? The rebirth of fighting games.

02:49:33.000 --> 02:49:37.000
It definitely did energize fighting games in kind of a new way this year.

02:49:37.000 --> 02:49:43.000
And it's interesting, having played Tekken 6 this week, I feel like Street Fighter IV did inspire some things in it.

02:49:43.000 --> 02:49:44.000
We'll see.

02:49:44.000 --> 02:49:45.000
Yeah.

02:49:45.000 --> 02:49:49.000
Alright, well thank you so much ActDeaf for the call. You have a great new year and be safe, okay?

02:49:49.000 --> 02:49:50.000
Thanks, you too.

02:49:50.000 --> 02:49:51.000
Alright, later.

02:49:51.000 --> 02:49:57.000
Again, if you want to give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR, our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.

02:49:57.000 --> 02:49:59.000
We are open and taking some calls.

02:49:59.000 --> 02:50:02.000
And I know the call, the phones have been ringing.

02:50:02.000 --> 02:50:09.000
So we're going to wait here and try to get a call when it comes through.

02:50:09.000 --> 02:50:13.000
Of course, now that I say that, nobody's calling in. It's like everybody's waiting because they still hear ActDeaf on the line.

02:50:13.000 --> 02:50:14.000
Oh, we got another call coming in.

02:50:14.000 --> 02:50:16.000
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this?

02:50:16.000 --> 02:50:19.000
This is that one across the ocean, AkiRipper.

02:50:19.000 --> 02:50:20.000
Hello AkiRipper.

02:50:20.000 --> 02:50:21.000
Hello.

02:50:21.000 --> 02:50:24.000
So good to hear from you. How are things in your neck of the woods?

02:50:24.000 --> 02:50:32.000
It's fun. It's quite fun. We have like, mostly fun, there's like, what is it?

02:50:32.000 --> 02:50:36.000
We have like a few feet of snow.

02:50:36.000 --> 02:50:47.000
And we have like, well, what is it? Like 20 minus degrees Celsius for a night like around minus something to something degrees.

02:50:47.000 --> 02:50:51.000
And, well, yay.

02:50:51.000 --> 02:50:59.000
Well, we're talking about, of course, by the way, it's been snowing here a little bit too and that was really creepy when that happened because it usually doesn't snow here.

02:50:59.000 --> 02:51:06.000
But it was kind of funny. You'd be very amused at how people freaked out over here at a little bit of snow when it wasn't even really snow.

02:51:06.000 --> 02:51:08.000
It was just like an eighth of an inch.

02:51:08.000 --> 02:51:10.000
It was like hail that stayed.

02:51:10.000 --> 02:51:15.000
I know, really. Anyhow, well, we're talking about, of course, video games and our games of the year and the decade.

02:51:15.000 --> 02:51:17.000
Anything you want to bring to this conversation?

02:51:17.000 --> 02:51:25.000
Game of the year is Sims 3, judging by the amount that I've played it.

02:51:25.000 --> 02:51:32.000
What makes Sims 3 your game of the year? I'm sure DarkSakura wouldn't argue with that, but what was it for you that made that game for you?

02:51:32.000 --> 02:51:45.000
Well, I'm new to this whole Sims game, so to say, since Sims 3 was the first Sims game that I really got addicted to.

02:51:45.000 --> 02:52:00.000
Add to the following fact that I haven't played WoW in almost a year now, so, well, there is that.

02:52:00.000 --> 02:52:09.000
And then there is the following fact that my computers tend to explode every new MMO release.

02:52:09.000 --> 02:52:15.000
It happened with Warhammer last year, and it happened with Aion.

02:52:15.000 --> 02:52:25.000
And, well, once I get to fix my computers, I have no desire to play any of those MMOs, unfortunately.

02:52:25.000 --> 02:52:31.000
What do you think it is? You know, we heard a lot this year about Aion possibly being the first game that's finally going to really challenge WoW,

02:52:31.000 --> 02:52:36.000
and then all of a sudden it kind of landed with this big, you know, like it just landed with a thud.

02:52:36.000 --> 02:52:41.000
You know, why is it that no MMO can take on WoW, you think?

02:52:41.000 --> 02:52:57.000
In my case, I don't know, since, well, as I said, my computers tend to just die a few weeks after it's been released, or the first week it is released.

02:52:57.000 --> 02:53:10.000
And, well, there seems to be this unlucky... I have this sudden streak of unlocked, and it's quite annoying.

02:53:10.000 --> 02:53:22.000
Other mentions, well, Shadow Complex and Dragon Age Origins.

02:53:22.000 --> 02:53:37.000
Even though Dragon Age Origins has been said before, because of the only games I play is mostly like The Sims 3,

02:53:37.000 --> 02:53:43.000
so I can't play, haven't played, since Dragon Age Origins that much.

02:53:43.000 --> 02:53:47.000
You know, I gotta say, I'm having similar problems, I think, to you in regards to my computer just kind of goes,

02:53:47.000 --> 02:53:52.000
eh, can't do it when trying to play Dragon Age. I probably should have picked it up on the console, but I don't know why,

02:53:52.000 --> 02:53:56.000
Dragon Age just feels like a game I need to play on the PC, so, you know, and that's where the good deal was.

02:53:56.000 --> 02:54:01.000
So, but yeah, that's a game that wasn't really mentioned before, it's a possible Game of the Year contender,

02:54:01.000 --> 02:54:06.000
and I think definitely a lot of big, big fans of that game, so.

02:54:06.000 --> 02:54:20.000
Other than that, well, this year I actually got a 360, so, well, yay on me. Supposedly so.

02:54:20.000 --> 02:54:25.000
A lot of people joined in the Xbox 360 Club and the PS3 Club this year, too, with the Slim.

02:54:25.000 --> 02:54:29.000
Anyway, Acre Reaper, we gotta let you go so we can get some more calls, but thank you so much for the call,

02:54:29.000 --> 02:54:31.000
and getting in tonight, alright?

02:54:31.000 --> 02:54:32.000
Yeah, well, better.

02:54:32.000 --> 02:54:34.000
Have a good New Year!

02:54:34.000 --> 02:54:37.000
He gets to see it before we do, because of his time zone, just so you know.

02:54:37.000 --> 02:54:40.000
So, he'll have to let us know how it is.

02:54:40.000 --> 02:54:43.000
Alright, we got another call coming in. Phones, we're getting off the hook tonight.

02:54:43.000 --> 02:54:44.000
Let's go to another call.

02:54:44.000 --> 02:54:46.000
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?

02:54:46.000 --> 02:54:48.000
Hello, it's Maren.

02:54:48.000 --> 02:54:50.000
Hi, Maren, how are you?

02:54:50.000 --> 02:54:54.000
I'm very good, thank you. How's everybody in the Orange Lounge Radio studio?

02:54:54.000 --> 02:54:57.000
We are doing good. You should know you were here last week.

02:54:57.000 --> 02:55:01.000
Yes, I was. I apparently came the wrong weekend.

02:55:01.000 --> 02:55:02.000
Geez.

02:55:02.000 --> 02:55:03.000
Why's that?

02:55:03.000 --> 02:55:10.000
So, anyways, I just wanted to talk about Game of the Year slash Game of the Decade caps.

02:55:10.000 --> 02:55:13.000
Please, please, yes. What would be your Game of the Year?

02:55:13.000 --> 02:55:17.000
At first, I just wanted to say I'm glad to hear you got home safe, because I know you drove all the way,

02:55:17.000 --> 02:55:18.000
and that's not a fun drive.

02:55:18.000 --> 02:55:19.000
No.

02:55:19.000 --> 02:55:21.000
But what was your Game of the Year and the Game of the Decade?

02:55:21.000 --> 02:55:25.000
My Game of the Year definitely was Beatles' rock band.

02:55:25.000 --> 02:55:33.000
As DarkSakura knows, because she was at my house visiting in the summer, I am a very, very, very big Beatles fan,

02:55:33.000 --> 02:55:39.000
so it was nice to get a rock band game that had a lot of songs that I know,

02:55:39.000 --> 02:55:42.000
as opposed to most of them, where I don't know a lot of the songs,

02:55:42.000 --> 02:55:45.000
because I'm an old fart and I only listen to oldies music.

02:55:45.000 --> 02:55:51.000
There's a lot of people just like you, though, that do that. They don't understand kids today.

02:55:51.000 --> 02:55:55.000
No, those kids and their strange music.

02:55:55.000 --> 02:56:02.000
So, yeah, it was nice to have a rock band game where I could actually sing all of the songs and enjoy myself.

02:56:02.000 --> 02:56:06.000
It wasn't as hardcore, I don't think, as the other rock band games,

02:56:06.000 --> 02:56:10.000
but it was fun for me and it was something I really enjoyed.

02:56:10.000 --> 02:56:14.000
It was put together beautifully, too, I think is one of the great things about it,

02:56:14.000 --> 02:56:16.000
is just visually it's a cool game.

02:56:16.000 --> 02:56:18.000
Dude, that bass was awesome.

02:56:18.000 --> 02:56:24.000
Yeah, it's really great and I still like every time that I play through the game and I play the end,

02:56:24.000 --> 02:56:28.000
there's like one part where Paul starts to sing end in the end and I'm like,

02:56:28.000 --> 02:56:31.000
I love you, Paul, it's so great.

02:56:31.000 --> 02:56:37.000
It's like you're back in the 1960s screaming at the Ed Sullivan Theater at the Beatles on the stage. Amazing.

02:56:37.000 --> 02:56:44.000
And actually what was funny was that I went to, when I was visiting, we played Beatles Rock Band

02:56:44.000 --> 02:56:53.000
and Dark Soccer has got the whole woofer sub surround sound, weird, all that crazy stuff.

02:56:53.000 --> 02:56:58.000
And when you were playing the songs that were live in Shea Stadium,

02:56:58.000 --> 02:57:03.000
one of the speakers that was behind us was all the girls screaming.

02:57:03.000 --> 02:57:09.000
And so it was just kind of funny to be playing and hearing girls screaming like crazy behind you.

02:57:09.000 --> 02:57:10.000
That's funny.

02:57:10.000 --> 02:57:14.000
What about Game of the Decade? Is this also your Game of the Decade or do you have a different pick?

02:57:14.000 --> 02:57:17.000
Game of the Decade was kind of more difficult.

02:57:17.000 --> 02:57:24.000
I decided to go with something that came out actually at the beginning of the decade and that was Diablo II.

02:57:24.000 --> 02:57:27.000
We mentioned that in our 2000 list, yeah?

02:57:27.000 --> 02:57:35.000
Yeah, and I think Diablo II definitely paved the way for a lot of the kind of games that we enjoy now,

02:57:35.000 --> 02:57:39.000
like World of Warcraft, Warcraft III, things like that.

02:57:39.000 --> 02:57:45.000
And it was just overall a really good game and I still play that.

02:57:45.000 --> 02:57:47.000
Yeah, there's still a lot of people playing that.

02:57:47.000 --> 02:57:50.000
There's still no Diablo III. There's still a lot of people playing Diablo II.

02:57:50.000 --> 02:57:56.000
But it's funny you kind of say that Diablo II paved the way for games like WoW because I really do agree.

02:57:56.000 --> 02:58:01.000
In fact, I used to kind of joke in World of Warcraft that it really should have just been called World of Diablo

02:58:01.000 --> 02:58:03.000
because that's kind of how it plays.

02:58:03.000 --> 02:58:04.000
Yeah, it really does.

02:58:04.000 --> 02:58:06.000
It plays a little more like Diablo and it is Warcraft.

02:58:06.000 --> 02:58:13.000
But yeah, there's so many great games that came out of this decade,

02:58:13.000 --> 02:58:18.000
but I think Diablo II really paved the way for a lot of other games and it was just overall really a good game.

02:58:18.000 --> 02:58:25.000
Like I said, I still play it, so if it's a game that you can play 10 years later, then that's something worthwhile.

02:58:25.000 --> 02:58:29.000
I think that's a darn good pick, so I'm not going to argue with you there.

02:58:29.000 --> 02:58:34.000
Maybe even though I picked something different, I can certainly see where Diablo II, without that we would not have had WoW.

02:58:34.000 --> 02:58:36.000
So it's a very good pick.

02:58:36.000 --> 02:58:40.000
And Battle.net and this whole infrastructure they had to build for that too.

02:58:40.000 --> 02:58:43.000
That's something that's continuing to evolve for them.

02:58:43.000 --> 02:58:47.000
Well, anything else on your mind tonight before we get to some more calls?

02:58:47.000 --> 02:58:52.000
No, that's it. I know you guys are ringing off the hook because I've tried calling in a few times before I got through.

02:58:52.000 --> 02:58:56.000
So I'll go ahead and let you go and it was nice chatting with you guys again.

02:58:56.000 --> 02:58:58.000
Thank you. It was very good to chat with you too.

02:58:58.000 --> 02:59:01.000
I think that we should take this opportunity though for a plug.

02:59:01.000 --> 02:59:04.000
I was actually going to say, yeah, before I let her go, I know you guys.

02:59:04.000 --> 02:59:08.000
Because this is how I know something's up.

02:59:08.000 --> 02:59:13.000
I came to the studio tonight and usually by the time I get here, which is about 5.15ish,

02:59:13.000 --> 02:59:18.000
I'm helping Dark Sakura set up kind of the studio and the mic and get the computer on and everything.

02:59:18.000 --> 02:59:20.000
Tonight it was already done.

02:59:20.000 --> 02:59:23.000
And I'm thinking, something's up.

02:59:23.000 --> 02:59:26.000
Either this is my Christmas present.

02:59:26.000 --> 02:59:31.000
So something's going on. I'm joking obviously. But what's going on you guys?

02:59:31.000 --> 02:59:39.000
Well, we've had our long running segment of my blog, which is Monday Comic Mania.

02:59:39.000 --> 02:59:43.000
And it's just where Dark Sakura and I kind of blog about upcoming comics in the week.

02:59:43.000 --> 02:59:50.000
And so we decided like last week when I was there to just kind of play around with the idea of doing a podcast of it.

02:59:50.000 --> 02:59:52.000
And we got a lot of positive feedback.

02:59:52.000 --> 03:00:01.000
So we are starting to do that on a regular basis and we actually did record our second episode today.

03:00:01.000 --> 03:00:03.000
It was pretty fun too.

03:00:03.000 --> 03:00:05.000
So where can they download the podcast if they want to check that out?

03:00:05.000 --> 03:00:10.000
If they want to check that out, they can go to AvengersTower.com.

03:00:10.000 --> 03:00:15.000
I see what's going on here. You're trying to ninja Dark Sakura from our show. That's what's going on.

03:00:15.000 --> 03:00:18.000
Well, to be fair, I've known Dark Sakura longer than you have.

03:00:18.000 --> 03:00:20.000
Alright. Oh, touche.

03:00:20.000 --> 03:00:21.000
Yeah, Rob.

03:00:21.000 --> 03:00:26.000
Touche. Alright, no. I obviously am a big fan of independent podcasting. I think that's great.

03:00:26.000 --> 03:00:32.000
So she's allowed to have a, I don't want to say a solo project because that's not what it is, but a side project.

03:00:32.000 --> 03:00:33.000
An affiliate program.

03:00:33.000 --> 03:00:34.000
That's right.

03:00:34.000 --> 03:00:42.000
You know, we did want to ask you to be the voice of our introduction for our podcast. So we would love to have you do that.

03:00:42.000 --> 03:00:48.000
Well, that's a very lovely compliment and I would love to do that. Just let me know what you need me to say and I'll record that for you, okay?

03:00:48.000 --> 03:00:50.000
I told you beforehand.

03:00:50.000 --> 03:00:54.000
Oh, yeah. You need, you want me to do it after the show tonight. I'll be happy to do that for you tonight. Sure. Sure.

03:00:54.000 --> 03:00:55.000
Great. Well, thank you guys.

03:00:55.000 --> 03:00:56.000
No problem.

03:00:56.000 --> 03:01:01.000
Alright, ToaGak in our chat room, chat.orangelandrater.com wants us to fight over Dark Sakura.

03:01:01.000 --> 03:01:07.000
So we will have to settle this in a battle of strip poker, clearly, is the only possible answer.

03:01:07.000 --> 03:01:11.000
Alright, we'll make it a date next time that I'm up in Sacramento.

03:01:11.000 --> 03:01:13.000
It's going to be one hot date. Yeah.

03:01:13.000 --> 03:01:14.000
Oh, baby.

03:01:14.000 --> 03:01:16.000
And no, it will not be broadcast on the internet.

03:01:16.000 --> 03:01:20.000
Alright. No, Maren, thank you so much for the call. You take care and have a great new year, okay?

03:01:20.000 --> 03:01:21.000
You too. Thanks.

03:01:21.000 --> 03:01:22.000
Later.

03:01:23.000 --> 03:01:27.000
Bochi Kawa in chat says they're just trying to bribe me with the introduction speech.

03:01:27.000 --> 03:01:31.000
Alright, let's get to another call. I think this is going to be our last call of the night.

03:01:31.000 --> 03:01:37.000
And from what I understand, the 1877 number is not working and I apologize for that. I don't know what the hell's going on.

03:01:37.000 --> 03:01:41.000
That would be one of those things I don't find out about until the show starts, so I apologize.

03:01:41.000 --> 03:01:44.000
Anyhow, Rama, you're on the phone. What's up?

03:01:44.000 --> 03:01:47.000
Well, you couldn't have an end-of-year show without me, guys.

03:01:47.000 --> 03:01:52.000
You do seem like a fitting personality to have here at the end of the year. What's on your mind?

03:01:52.000 --> 03:01:57.000
Not too much. I just want to give what I thought was my game of the year.

03:01:57.000 --> 03:01:59.000
Well, please, what was your game of the year?

03:01:59.000 --> 03:02:02.000
Ghostbusters, the video game.

03:02:02.000 --> 03:02:03.000
That was awesome.

03:02:03.000 --> 03:02:06.000
You know what's funny? Yes, it was.

03:02:06.000 --> 03:02:09.000
What was about this game? What made it so goddamn awesome?

03:02:09.000 --> 03:02:17.000
You know how whenever you do a movie to video game, the video game generally sucks donkey balls.

03:02:17.000 --> 03:02:23.000
Ghostbusters the video game was one of those shining gems where it came out really good.

03:02:23.000 --> 03:02:31.000
Granted, it's not really based off the movie. On the same token, it's like a sequel to the first two movies.

03:02:31.000 --> 03:02:37.000
But you still kind of go through elements of the first two movies as you play the game, which I thought was fun.

03:02:37.000 --> 03:02:43.000
But game of the year, Rama? Is that enough to make this game of the year?

03:02:43.000 --> 03:02:46.000
What is it about the game itself that just made you go,

03:02:46.000 --> 03:02:49.000
you know, above everything else I played this year, I love this the most?

03:02:49.000 --> 03:02:53.000
Well, number one, I'm not a sports fan.

03:02:53.000 --> 03:03:00.000
Number two, I am an RPG fan, but I can't sit there and play them enough to say that so-and-so RPG is game of the year.

03:03:00.000 --> 03:03:06.000
And I'm kind of fed up with all the music, band, games, so on and so forth.

03:03:06.000 --> 03:03:11.000
Are you still there? Hello?

03:03:11.000 --> 03:03:12.000
Yeah, I'm right here.

03:03:12.000 --> 03:03:14.000
Oh, God, it sounded like you cut out for a minute there. I was like, ah!

03:03:14.000 --> 03:03:15.000
Sorry.

03:03:15.000 --> 03:03:22.000
No, that's okay. It's just up your genre. It's the genre you want to do and you're just kind of sick of the other saturated genres.

03:03:22.000 --> 03:03:23.000
Well, that's fair enough.

03:03:23.000 --> 03:03:27.000
What about the bigger question? I don't know if you gave this any thought, but what about the game of the decade?

03:03:27.000 --> 03:03:30.000
Game of the decade, wow.

03:03:30.000 --> 03:03:31.000
I know, this is so much.

03:03:31.000 --> 03:03:33.000
Wow.

03:03:33.000 --> 03:03:41.000
I don't think I can really pinpoint a game of the decade. I don't think I really could. I'd actually have to sit there and think about that.

03:03:41.000 --> 03:03:49.000
You know, I don't think a lot of people could truly, even though we read this list off of Yahoo and so forth and said, you know, they did a pretty good job at least of where to start,

03:03:49.000 --> 03:03:55.000
I don't think you will truly be able to know what the biggest games of the decade were until about five years from now,

03:03:55.000 --> 03:04:01.000
when you're really able to look back, accurately look back and say, okay, what games really shaped where we're at now?

03:04:01.000 --> 03:04:08.000
You can kind of do that a little bit with the earlier games in the decade. For instance, we were having a chat earlier about how Diablo 2 ultimately shaped World of Warcraft.

03:04:08.000 --> 03:04:17.000
You know, I think it'll be interesting to see, because if some of these things like Natal and the Sony ice cream cone fail,

03:04:17.000 --> 03:04:22.000
then you can say that maybe Wii Sports wasn't as big as we thought it was. Maybe it really was just a flash in the pan.

03:04:22.000 --> 03:04:26.000
But if these two things blow up, then it kind of adds value to Wii Sports in a way.

03:04:26.000 --> 03:04:35.000
Pretty much. I mean, I can't really say on the PC side of things with Diablo, because I grew up mostly doing console gaming.

03:04:35.000 --> 03:04:40.000
And I had a PC, but nothing worthy of playing half these games that are out there.

03:04:40.000 --> 03:04:45.000
And when I saw some of these games in the store, I was always drawing towards the console games.

03:04:45.000 --> 03:04:51.000
Yeah, and that's a lot of people in that same boat. There's a lot of people also the exact opposite.

03:04:51.000 --> 03:04:56.000
They just can't get into the consoles. They have to play on the PC with the keyboard and the mouse, or it just doesn't work.

03:04:56.000 --> 03:04:59.000
It's one of the reasons why I don't play Halo.

03:04:59.000 --> 03:05:07.000
Alright. Well, Rama, you're going to be the last call of the year. Do you have anything else you want to share with our listeners tonight?

03:05:07.000 --> 03:05:14.000
Yeah, a couple of things. Number one, a few podcast episodes back, you had mentioned whatever happened to Trade West.

03:05:14.000 --> 03:05:15.000
Yes.

03:05:15.000 --> 03:05:21.000
I think a couple of years after they did Double Dragon, they were acquired by Midway.

03:05:21.000 --> 03:05:24.000
Oh, okay. Alright.

03:05:24.000 --> 03:05:28.000
So they're pretty much no more, is my assumption.

03:05:28.000 --> 03:05:33.000
Sure, sure. And that makes sense, because I want to say Midway did some Double Dragon games later on, so that makes total sense.

03:05:33.000 --> 03:05:42.000
And last thing I'll leave this note on to you, Jamie, Matt, thank you.

03:05:42.000 --> 03:05:44.000
You're welcome.

03:05:44.000 --> 03:05:45.000
You're welcome.

03:05:45.000 --> 03:05:57.000
No, really. I mean, I tune in every Sunday to listen to you guys talk about gaming, and from time to time, you guys move off of gaming, talk about stuff in your personal lives, which do affect all of us.

03:05:57.000 --> 03:06:05.000
And I like the fact that we can come together as a family and discuss some of these things, like Proposition 8 and so forth.

03:06:05.000 --> 03:06:21.000
That was something I really appreciate, so it was like that one time, take DV from the gaming, talk about something that's more important, more of an impact in our lives that we need to discuss, and see how we all feel about that.

03:06:21.000 --> 03:06:26.000
So that's something I appreciate, and you know what, thank you.

03:06:26.000 --> 03:06:39.000
Well, thank you very much. It makes us feel very good about what we do, certainly, and I know that sometimes I'm kind of joking. Sometimes my role on the show is to try and make sure we get back to the games at some point.

03:06:39.000 --> 03:06:52.000
Obviously, I've certainly, with some of the things you mentioned, kind of gone astray myself, and I'm really thankful that the audience has let us do that, has come to grow to let us do that, and not expect that we're just going to be all games all the time.

03:06:52.000 --> 03:06:59.000
But I think it really speaks, especially this time of year. These are the types of things we think about as the family and what's important to us.

03:06:59.000 --> 03:07:14.000
And I think there is a sense of family in our listenership that is astounding, and it's been something that's kind of grown through this whole decade, and it's going to continue on over the next few...

03:07:14.000 --> 03:07:15.000
We are the LL Army.

03:07:15.000 --> 03:07:16.000
That's right.

03:07:16.000 --> 03:07:28.000
It's like, you know, at first I felt like I should be kind of offended that you're bringing in personal stuff, but then I realized, if you guys don't talk about it and bring it up, who is? I mean, we all listen to you guys.

03:07:28.000 --> 03:07:35.000
You're like the voice of gaming to us, you know? We're like one giant, happy mafia family.

03:07:35.000 --> 03:07:39.000
Oh God, don't put that responsibility on us or we might get scared. No, I...

03:07:39.000 --> 03:07:42.000
I've already got a whole bag full of tattoos now.

03:07:42.000 --> 03:07:44.000
That's what's up.

03:07:44.000 --> 03:07:52.000
You know what's funny is that, you know, and I've said this before, and I know I've gotten into this story on the show a million times, but the very first episode of Orange Lawns Radio, there were 12 people listening.

03:07:52.000 --> 03:07:57.000
And we thought we were fucking rock stars because I was like, whoa, double digits. We fucking rock.

03:07:57.000 --> 03:08:01.000
You know, like I honestly thought it was like the best thing ever.

03:08:01.000 --> 03:08:06.000
But, you know, at the end of the day, I think there were seriously some episodes where we had more people at the house during the taping.

03:08:06.000 --> 03:08:10.000
Remember the house we used to do the show from the very beginning? Then there were people that were listening.

03:08:10.000 --> 03:08:17.000
But it was just kind of about getting together and having fun and not really caring about the listeners as a number.

03:08:17.000 --> 03:08:19.000
Not the listener count.

03:08:19.000 --> 03:08:23.000
Yeah, as a number, as an inanimate object that you couldn't really see.

03:08:23.000 --> 03:08:32.000
But kind of watching it grow and then kind of get big with the whole podcasting thing into an audience that really interacts with us and so forth has been just really amazing.

03:08:32.000 --> 03:08:42.000
Well, it's like every single person that listens to us is a person, not a statistic. You know, we may say, oh, well, 90 people tuned in this week. Yay.

03:08:42.000 --> 03:08:51.000
And, oh, this many people downloaded it. But each and every one of you listening to this, either recorded or live right now, you are a person.

03:08:51.000 --> 03:08:57.000
And I appreciate that you're all taking time out of your day to dedicate a little time to us.

03:08:57.000 --> 03:09:03.000
Not just a little time. This show's fucking long. I don't know if you're aware, but like three, it's up four hours sometimes.

03:09:03.000 --> 03:09:09.000
It's an exchange. We'll dedicate our time to you. You dedicate some time to us and it works.

03:09:09.000 --> 03:09:12.000
And that really is all we've ever asked. You know, tell people about the show. Help spread the word.

03:09:12.000 --> 03:09:15.000
And send me donuts. I really like donuts.

03:09:15.000 --> 03:09:25.000
It's a quick little exchange. I mean, I don't mean to cut you guys off, but through the various jobs I've had, as long as I've been listening to the show, I've made sure that I would arrange my schedule so I would listen to you guys.

03:09:25.000 --> 03:09:30.000
I stopped what I do on Sundays to come in here and be with you guys, you know?

03:09:30.000 --> 03:09:36.000
If it wasn't for you guys, I wouldn't be able to do my own podcast. I mean, I thank you guys for that, you know?

03:09:36.000 --> 03:09:41.000
I mean, if it wasn't for you guys, I wouldn't be able to do this, you know?

03:09:41.000 --> 03:09:43.000
We want you to come back and see us too.

03:09:43.000 --> 03:09:45.000
Because Fannie Mae was a blast.

03:09:45.000 --> 03:09:53.000
I'm planning on it. And working on bringing Jodea, Misty, I'm working on it one way or another.

03:09:53.000 --> 03:09:58.000
Even if that means I've got to pack them in boxes and ship them metal here, Solid Snake style.

03:09:58.000 --> 03:10:01.000
We'll be there for the 4th of July, you know?

03:10:01.000 --> 03:10:03.000
Alright. I'm holding you to that.

03:10:03.000 --> 03:10:09.000
Dude, I'm actually wanting to get to New York. I mean, I would love to find my way up there sometime.

03:10:09.000 --> 03:10:15.000
You know, it's been since I was 17 years old was the last time. The one and only time, I think.

03:10:15.000 --> 03:10:19.000
No, I went once when I was an infant, so therefore I don't remember it.

03:10:19.000 --> 03:10:22.000
But that was the last time I went to New York.

03:10:22.000 --> 03:10:28.000
Look at it this way, Amy. If you come out here, Patty has a room just for you.

03:10:28.000 --> 03:10:32.000
The bed is ready and everything. It says Dark Soccer Guest Room right there.

03:10:32.000 --> 03:10:34.000
Really?

03:10:34.000 --> 03:10:36.000
So who's got $400 I can borrow, huh?

03:10:36.000 --> 03:10:40.000
Sister Act is supposed to be on Broadway this next year. I'm coming out there to see that, you know that.

03:10:40.000 --> 03:10:43.000
Alright, anyhow, Rama, this is also going on the longest call of the decade.

03:10:43.000 --> 03:10:45.000
So I have to say, thank you.

03:10:45.000 --> 03:10:46.000
I'm sorry.

03:10:46.000 --> 03:10:48.000
No, it was all worth it. Thank you. Have a wonderful night.

03:10:48.000 --> 03:10:51.000
And thank you for being a long time supporter of the show. We really appreciate it.

03:10:51.000 --> 03:10:54.000
And really a lot of people that called in tonight were in that same boat.

03:10:54.000 --> 03:10:55.000
So thank you, Rama. Take care.

03:10:55.000 --> 03:10:57.000
Have fun. Take care.

03:10:57.000 --> 03:11:00.000
Again, apologies to those that didn't get through.

03:11:00.000 --> 03:11:04.000
And apologies that the 877 number apparently was borked and I was unaware.

03:11:04.000 --> 03:11:08.000
I didn't do that on purpose. Apologize to you guys who weren't able to get through because of that.

03:11:08.000 --> 03:11:12.000
But we are going to leave it at that note. Of course we'll be back here next week.

03:11:12.000 --> 03:11:17.000
We always are. To do it all again. Take more calls. Do more emails. Do it again.

03:11:17.000 --> 03:11:21.000
Until our lives change and we're just not able to do it anymore.

03:11:21.000 --> 03:11:24.000
Don't know when that's going to be. I don't want to focus on that right now.

03:11:24.000 --> 03:11:27.000
Let's just focus on what a great decade it's been for video games.

03:11:27.000 --> 03:11:30.000
And it's just going to continue to grow and who knows what the future holds.

03:11:30.000 --> 03:11:32.000
It's going to be crazy.

03:11:32.000 --> 03:11:35.000
Well, it's that part of the show where we go around and get everybody's final thoughts.

03:11:35.000 --> 03:11:39.000
Actually, quickly, are there any last minute stories? I forgot to have Loki clear those out.

03:11:39.000 --> 03:11:43.000
Just really quickly, stupid things. Like I mentioned before, Dark Void.

03:11:43.000 --> 03:11:49.000
Coming out from Capcom. There is also going to be a DSI game coming out as well for Dark Void.

03:11:49.000 --> 03:11:54.000
That's being done in the 8-bit retro style. And it's going to be kind of a side-scroller game.

03:11:54.000 --> 03:11:58.000
So that's going to be pretty awesome. That'll be out in January for five bucks.

03:11:58.000 --> 03:11:59.000
It does look neat.

03:11:59.000 --> 03:12:04.000
Aliens vs. Predators getting a special limited edition, including a face-hugger.

03:12:04.000 --> 03:12:06.000
Yes, that's right. You get your own very...

03:12:06.000 --> 03:12:07.000
I love you!

03:12:07.000 --> 03:12:10.000
Your own alien that can hug your face.

03:12:10.000 --> 03:12:13.000
And then finally, I just thought this was kind of strange.

03:12:13.000 --> 03:12:18.000
Prinny is getting a sequel on the PSP, Prinny 2.

03:12:18.000 --> 03:12:25.000
And it's about, apparently, you have to reclaim Aetna's stolen underwear.

03:12:25.000 --> 03:12:31.000
Yes, the game is actually called Prinny 2 Dawn of the Great Pantsu War.

03:12:31.000 --> 03:12:34.000
And that'll be out in Japan on March 25th.

03:12:34.000 --> 03:12:35.000
Pantsu?

03:12:35.000 --> 03:12:36.000
Yes.

03:12:36.000 --> 03:12:42.000
That's all I had. Oh, and apparently, and I read this and just said,

03:12:42.000 --> 03:12:46.000
Eh, that's stupid, but hey, I'll add it to the show roll.

03:12:46.000 --> 03:12:53.000
Apparently, John Gosselin's Wii was stolen.

03:12:53.000 --> 03:12:59.000
Who gives a shit about that douchebag?

03:12:59.000 --> 03:13:06.000
Let him go to the cemetery of news people we just don't care about anymore.

03:13:06.000 --> 03:13:10.000
He is no longer relevant. Bam. Done.

03:13:10.000 --> 03:13:13.000
Who cares that he had a Wii that got stolen?

03:13:13.000 --> 03:13:14.000
Well, sorry.

03:13:14.000 --> 03:13:19.000
Sorry, there's also a free New Year's theme for Xbox Live, so you can download that.

03:13:19.000 --> 03:13:24.000
Yippie skippy. But look, who cares about some a-hole in his Wii?

03:13:24.000 --> 03:13:26.000
Just forget it.

03:13:26.000 --> 03:13:30.000
Although I don't think people should steal things, even if the guy is a douchebag,

03:13:30.000 --> 03:13:32.000
but now when you steal it, people just report on it.

03:13:32.000 --> 03:13:34.000
So now you've done a double bad thing by stealing his Wii.

03:13:34.000 --> 03:13:36.000
Rawr.

03:13:36.000 --> 03:13:40.000
Anyhow, I don't mean to end this on a negative note, damn you, Loki.

03:13:40.000 --> 03:13:44.000
Let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts.

03:13:44.000 --> 03:13:46.000
Loki, your final thought?

03:13:46.000 --> 03:13:52.000
My final thought is I need to install more games on my main cabinet.

03:13:52.000 --> 03:13:56.000
My final thought is I hope I get enough sleep, because I've got to go back to work tomorrow.

03:13:56.000 --> 03:13:58.000
Boo.

03:13:58.000 --> 03:14:00.000
DarkSahara, your final thought?

03:14:00.000 --> 03:14:03.000
Uh...

03:14:03.000 --> 03:14:07.000
I only have three words, Rob.

03:14:07.000 --> 03:14:09.000
Reject false icons.

03:14:09.000 --> 03:14:11.000
A very lovely thought to end on.

03:14:11.000 --> 03:14:13.000
Guys, don't forget about Orange Launch Revolution's second mix,

03:14:13.000 --> 03:14:18.000
the awesome tribute project that's out there that our fans put together.

03:14:18.000 --> 03:14:21.000
All the information is available on OrangeLaunchReview.com,

03:14:21.000 --> 03:14:24.000
as well as information on the OLR Madness,

03:14:24.000 --> 03:14:26.000
what used to be the March Madness.

03:14:26.000 --> 03:14:30.000
That event is going on right now, taking your top 25 picks of all time,

03:14:30.000 --> 03:14:32.000
and we'll get into that more in future weeks

03:14:32.000 --> 03:14:36.000
when we're not so focused on the weeks and the decades and so forth.

03:14:36.000 --> 03:14:38.000
Check out all that on Orange Launch Radio.

03:14:38.000 --> 03:14:42.000
Again, if you like the show, all we ask, tell a couple friends about the show.

03:14:42.000 --> 03:14:44.000
Thank you guys so much.

03:14:44.000 --> 03:14:46.000
Here we are 350 episodes later,

03:14:46.000 --> 03:14:50.000
and we're looking forward to doing episode 351 next week.

03:14:50.000 --> 03:14:53.000
So we'll be here same time next week to do it all over again,

03:14:53.000 --> 03:14:55.000
right after Bobby Black Wolf.

03:14:55.000 --> 03:14:59.000
Until then, have a great and safe new year,

03:14:59.000 --> 03:15:02.000
and we will see you next decade.

03:15:02.000 --> 03:15:04.000
Have a wonderful night, everybody.

03:15:06.000 --> 03:15:10.000
