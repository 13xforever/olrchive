14395	15796	December 6, 2009.
16536	18417	Steam is about to get some more competition.
18697	21198	Could you soon play PSP Minis on your PS3?
21538	24960	And a long-lasting video game rumor is revealed to be true this week.
32836	37203	Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
37223	40648	We are that video game talk show dedicated to, of course, video games.
41009	44034	Video gaming, gaming culture, the gamer lifestyle, and food!
44434	45656	Lots and lots of food!
46117	46778	And crushing!
46838	47579	Nom nom nom.
48220	48641	and Yarn.
49181	52324	A third crocheting because I don't have the patience for that stuff.
52364	56328	And you've crocheted, by the way, of course, the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers and I'm Rob Roberts.
56348	56848	I'm making a hat.
57049	58050	And he's Techmaster Loki.
58250	59351	Why not just introduce him too?
59811	60772	How you doing, Techmaster Loki?
60932	61433	I'm doing fine.
61573	61873	Amazing.
62114	62874	Okay, so crocheting.
63615	64636	I don't have the patience for that.
65357	65577	Okay.
66077	66498	Just saying.
67276	69738	I didn't think I did either, but it's actually fairly therapeutic.
69918	72159	I sit in front of my computer and chat with Becky or whoever else is on.
72179	73780	And watch random YouTubage?
85720	85840	No.
86441	88824	Well, sometimes I'll watch other people crocheting while I crochet.
89245	94011	It's sort of like eating food while you're watching the Food Network or watching porn while you fuck.
95473	98597	Or in my case, watching The Biggest Loser while eating a giant pizza.
98637	99738	That's what I like to do.
100259	101320	It makes me feel good about myself.
102241	103343	Techmaster Loki, how are you doing?
103363	103964	How's your week going?
105086	105566	It's okay.
133522	134503	Arcade Cabinet, I guess.
134903	135183	Sort of.
135704	136484	Bartop Cabinet.
136584	137745	That looks ghetto.
137965	139406	There's pictures of it at OrangeLawnRadio.com.
139486	140267	It's awesome, though.
140507	141948	No, it's ghetto awesome.
142188	143329	Yes.
143569	145811	So there's something... I don't know what happened with it.
145971	150375	It was something because I had wired up the analog stick to the directional...
151335	152116	Joystick that I had.
152397	153478	And there's a way you can do it.
153518	154299	It's pretty easy.
154499	164390	And the contact points are a lot bigger than trying to solder to the small, really tiny ribbon cable solder points that are for the actual digital directional pad.
165752	168475	So I figured, okay, I'll just solder to that.
168655	171236	Well, something happened, and I'm not sure what.
171837	174818	I thought I bridged something, but apparently that wasn't the case.
175259	180522	And for whatever reason, it just... The PSP seemed like it was only pressing down.
181162	184464	And it just consistently held down, down.
185684	191328	So that made it hard to kind of select games, play anything, because, you know, it'd be always pressing down.
192388	196931	So I figured, okay, I'm gonna look at and see what I did solder-wise, and I...
198188	198829	Thanks for watching!
216676	221497	I'm just going to kind of take a break from it right now because there's not much I can really do with it.
221517	224918	Well, it's got to be frustrating that you build this whole machine and then it just, oops.
224938	226138	Well, yeah, it was all ready to go.
226158	227979	I had some trouble like earlier in the week.
228059	239982	I couldn't get it to stay powered on and that I realized was a mistake because I had hooked up a push button backwards so it was hooked to the normally open instead of the normally closed.
240742	261583	and you know that causes it to basically when the button's not being pressed to be the button is pressed and then when you push the button the button isn't pressed so it's kind of backwards and once I fixed that it worked just fine powered up you know everything was hunky-dory and then you know I tested what buttons worked and what didn't and apparently my
262523	270628	R button didn't really work, which I'm guessing is because the solder point was super tiny, so I probably missed it when I was soldering.
271349	276252	And my triangle button wasn't working, which I didn't really even get to the point to fix that yet.
277393	282516	And then the constantly pressing down thing, which was kind of annoying.
284890	285490	Thanks for watching!
294929	298412	Not quite everything yet, but there's a lot of it that's salvageable.
298912	302855	And honestly, if I want to try again, I mean, PSPs are dirt cheap.
302915	305818	If I look on Craigslist, I can get one sub 50 bucks.
306078	306318	Nice.
306338	308280	You know, if I want to do that.
308560	314485	And at the same time, I actually figured out a way requiring an extra device to be purchased.
314565	319048	But there is a way that's actually super easy to do that.
319269	323532	And not only will I be able to use the PSP in the arcade cabinet...
323852	323912	Wow.
339112	342875	It doesn't matter anyways, because I will have a working bar top cabinet.
342895	344536	I love that you just haven't totally given up.
345296	346257	It'll come back stronger.
346417	347057	PSP Cabinet 2.0.
348338	349279	Bigger and better.
349499	353681	At the same time, it was kind of a learning experience, because now I know how to solder slightly better.
354062	357043	Not enough to where I need to solder these...
358544	364027	Really small wires onto these contacts, and it was just, it was a mess.
364107	371191	It was super delicate, I mean, there was so much that could have gone wrong, and a lot of it did, and it was just, it wasn't pretty.
371431	377394	So, the second time around will be a lot better, and a lot cleaner, and should work.
377755	382958	But, when I actually get around to that, I don't know, because I have a lot of things I gotta work on, so.
383978	385879	It will not be forgotten.
386079	387420	It will be taken care of at some point.
387622	388903	Plus, it's just a busy time of year.
389263	391305	This isn't the best time to start a big project.
391845	392966	Well, I have other projects.
393527	397830	I tend to start projects when I have other projects going and don't finish things.
398591	404395	I have my arcade cabinet, the actual arcade cabinet, that I've got everything almost ready for that.
404416	410540	I was just working on the front end to get some of the themes I had for a hyper-spin to work correctly.
412262	413363	Otherwise, it's ready to go.
413983	416866	So I may just play around with that, actually enjoy the fruits of my labor.
417646	420330	and then later on, you know, tackle this stuff.
420470	432165	Actually, for whatever reason on Impulse Buy, I purchased what they call a Dingo A320, which, you know, it's not an actual Dingo, but it's a little...
434090	434690	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
454122	466632	I probably could turn that into a cabinet as well if I wanted to in place of this because I could hook up the video out to an old PS1 LCD monitor that I have still, so maybe.
467073	473278	But then again, you know, it's pretty nice and I don't want to kind of mess that up, so I'll just probably get another PSP and just do it.
473958	474919	I'll fix it this time.
475540	481965	But other than that, you know, that's pretty much what I've been doing other than, you know, grant the thought and stuff.
482495	482836	Alright.
483357	486422	Well, I was going to get into Gaming Weeks, but you pretty much took the cake with that one.
486462	486883	That's alright.
487324	488145	Let's go over to Jamie.
489407	490770	How was your Gaming Week, DarkSakura?
491251	494076	I played World of Warcraft and knitted.
494536	495138	Or crocheted.
495580	496601	Watch Dan play Borderlands.
522839	523860	I watched a little bit of that.
523900	526581	I'm not super familiar with Borderlands, although I've heard a lot of good things about it.
526901	529123	And I was watching Dan play a little bit of it as I was walking in tonight.
529143	532824	I like the Crazy Mutant Midgets.
532844	535086	Is that what they're actually called?
535246	537027	Yes, the Crazy Mutant Midgets or something like that.
537487	537787	Amazing.
539208	540508	Loki, was there anything else for your gaming week?
540528	542449	I know you're talking about hacks, but other games you've been playing?
542970	543850	Just Grand Theft Auto.
544951	545751	That's pretty much it.
547670	553398	All the opportunity that I had to play games this weekend, I was just too busy working on that stupid box cabinet thing.
553911	554111	Nice.
555531	556331	Let's see, My Gaming Week.
556932	557752	Two new games.
558112	560332	One, just a demo, so I can't really tell you about the game.
560692	562253	But the demo I played was Bayonetta.
562753	564313	And didn't know a whole lot about the game.
564393	568114	I kind of knew it was like a Devil May Cry-ish game with a hot chick as the main character.
568134	568714	It's awesome.
568774	570574	But I didn't know a whole lot about it.
570854	574335	But one of my friends was like, no, you really, really need to play this demo.
574675	575555	It's quite astounding.
575875	577135	And I was like, okay, I'll check it out.
577215	578136	What have I got to lose?
578156	579096	I'm not paying anything for it.
579416	579556	So...
580356	581177	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
602691	603812	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
627731	628492	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
658231	659553	It's so over the top.
659813	661794	I was laughing and laughing and laughing.
661814	670641	And just this move where you spin the controller like 360 degrees and hit one of the buttons and then she'll get on the ground and start... Her high heels are guns.
670882	674625	So she starts shooting from her high heels and you can actually aim at the monsters.
675045	677967	It is insanity and I loved every minute of it.
678027	682851	So I am so excited for the full version of the game because it was just so over the top.
682891	684833	And some of the boss fights were extremely silly.
685533	685553	I...
686714	695180	I can't believe how much I enjoyed this game because it's not usually the type of game I'm all into, but just the absurdness and over-the-topness and the design of the characters.
695740	698181	I can see why now this game is getting all the praise it is.
699962	701123	I had a good time.
701363	703305	And by the way, did you notice she's wearing her hair?
703765	705046	Her hair is like her weapon.
705106	705326	Yes.
705626	708948	And she turns her hair into demons that will bite the heads off of monsters.
708988	709608	She has witch hair.
709688	712850	Which conveniently leaves her with a naked booty.
713811	714772	Or a thong or something.
716429	718851	Who would win in a fight, Bayonetta or the Baroness?
719811	724215	I would have to say Bayonetta is going to just kick her into a guillotine and snap her fingers and it's over.
724655	727217	So, you know, with all due respect to the Baroness.
727798	731521	I guess they're saying in chat room, TigerClaw says, Bayonetta looks like the Baroness.
732442	736765	And if you want to join us in our chat, chat.orangelawntrader.com, of course, is always a place you can do that.
737846	739908	And I really do need to play that game because I have my...
741013	742214	My Japanese 360 now.
742334	743414	And I actually do have the game.
743474	745955	I just haven't played it yet because I've been working on Crapply.
747316	753519	You really need to play it and seriously call me when you do because I want to hear your initial impressions before next week's show.
753539	754680	You need to bring it over.
756041	757684	Yeah, I want to play the full one.
758144	758605	Looks like fun.
759066	761369	Alright, anyhow, also my gaming week.
761810	765816	Not a demo, but a full game, and one I've been intending to play for a while.
766237	767318	New Super Mario Bros.
767358	770683	Wii, which was a game I played at E3, and I was kind of like, yeah, it's okay.
772205	780011	I played it with one of the nice booth babes there who was trying to show me the parts of the game and obviously I was getting into the multiplayer experience and I was like, yeah, it's okay.
780391	782052	But I wish that they would go back.
782072	783633	And I said this on the show a couple weeks ago.
783673	788237	I said, I really want them to go back and make like Super Mario Bros.
788717	789418	4 or something like that.
789438	792800	Like a game like the old Mario Bros.
792920	799625	that kind of, without all this extra frilly stuff that they've kind of done in some of the more recent Mario releases and 3D and all that stuff.
800286	800406	And
801997	803598	I have to admit, I was wrong.
803938	804758	This is that game.
819423	820384	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
839454	840275	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
859427	867695	And as I heard Bobby mention on his show, of course, Bobby Blackwolf's always on before we are at All Games Radio when we broadcast live on Sunday nights.
868015	871479	He was kind of talking about how there wasn't really a tutorial mode.
871519	874221	So if you've never played a Mario game before, there's a lot of stuff you miss.
874582	875623	And I kind of agree with that.
875663	882829	Like if the game has one flaw, it was that I didn't know you could hit the A button to avoid death in multiplayer mode until...
883590	885371	A little ways into it, playing with friends.
885411	887451	And I suppose the discovery of it was okay.
887511	895034	But yeah, I would have liked, since this is supposed to be something for everyone, there to be a little more of a basic tutorial mode.
895614	903697	But honestly, that's a very minor flaw in what is otherwise a stellar game and just a really fun multiplayer experience with a lot of variety.
903717	906918	There's some new suits, like the propeller suit and the penguin suit.
907319	909599	And now you have ice balls as well as fireballs.
910160	910260	And
911280	911740	Thanks for watching!
927691	929192	Really happy for this game.
929812	930753	Reading some comments from chat.
930793	933735	Zappy says, I guess Sky never played New Super Mario Bros.
933775	934215	on the DS.
934776	935576	Actually, that's not true.
935776	937057	I did play it on the DS.
937738	942240	But you have to kind of go back and remember that I have an extreme bias against handheld games.
942681	946003	Especially when they are porting over games that I remember from consoles.
946063	949565	And I am the first to admit, it's completely irrational and stupid.
950105	956389	But I don't like games I remember from my television playing big on my big sound speaker, larger than life.
957523	958484	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
983103	985424	Let's see, trying to look for some other questions from chat.
986845	987366	Let's see.
989207	992329	Again, if you want to join our chat, chat.orangelongeradio.com.
993390	994750	And I think they're talking about some other games.
994770	998213	They're talking about Tekken and stuff in chat right now, which I did not play during my gaming week.
998773	1007879	But between those couple games and a little bit of other things here and there, not a whole lot of other major games this week, but I really enjoyed Super Mario Bros.
1007919	1008079	Wii.
1008339	1009019	And you know what's weird?
1009059	1009420	Because...
1010080	1012501	Every time... I know we've given Nintendo a hard time on this show.
1012761	1024023	And we've come on here and we've said, you know, Nintendo is so out of touch with gaming, they don't, you know, they're not getting it, and Microsoft and Sony are doing all these things online that are, you know, miles ahead of what the Wii is doing.
1024083	1029704	But then, damn, they always release a game like this that really reminds you they do know how to do fun.
1030305	1031525	It's just that, unfortunately, it's...
1032185	1036347	You only get a couple of these releases a year that kind of remind you of that fact.
1037307	1040768	But I do recommend the game, especially if you played Mario 1 growing up.
1040848	1045150	If you have that same desire I have, God, I wish they'd make a game like Mario 3 or Mario World again.
1045310	1045930	This is that game.
1046371	1048511	And then there's multiplayer in it to boot that's actually kind of fun.
1049032	1051953	Except for the fact that the princess isn't in it, but she got kidnapped again.
1052053	1052433	What can you do?
1053663	1054003	DarkSakura.com
1067948	1068228	Let's see.
1068488	1069129	Comment from chat.
1069189	1070729	Ricky Go Max says, I would play that.
1070789	1071570	Peach's Quest.
1071850	1073410	You know, there was a game like that on DS.
1074131	1076212	Speaking of DS and everything.
1076372	1077372	There was a Princess Peach game.
1077392	1078613	Super Princess Peach, wasn't it called?
1079673	1080393	It was different, though.
1080654	1081914	It wasn't really a Mario game.
1081954	1085276	See, that was one of those Nintendo trying to take a Mario thing.
1086256	1088497	It was okay, but it wasn't Mario Brothers.
1088637	1089677	It was Super PMS.
1091018	1092279	Yeah, she used her emotions.
1092319	1094179	I remember the emotions was a big part of that game.
1094560	1095060	A little silly.
1095760	1099244	So anyhow, let's get into some housekeeping tonight.
1099545	1100586	Some housekeeping I wanted to state.
1100666	1102448	We will not be live next week.
1102488	1105192	We will not have a live show next week, and that's completely my fault.
1105652	1108195	I'm going to be out of town next Sunday.
1108936	1113041	It's really no secret I'm going to see Lady Gaga in concert, and I couldn't be more excited.
1113101	1113722	So sorry, guys.
1114383	1115264	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1136781	1138142	Ask All Games if we can go live.
1138182	1141303	So stay tuned to our Twitter and our Facebook.
1141603	1146044	Twitter.com slash OLR and Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio, all one word.
1146725	1151106	And of course our website, OrangeLoungeRadio.com for the details on when that pre-taping will happen.
1151687	1156608	So again, if you are used to coming here Sunday nights and listening, you're still going to get a new show next week.
1156648	1157929	You will hear a new show Sunday night.
1158269	1159489	It just won't be live.
1159710	1160190	And, you know...
1161030	1161690	Thank you for watching!
1184645	1189490	So starting things off, this is kind of interesting, but not too surprising.
1189830	1193554	Games for Windows Live, they've decided to add Games on Demand.
1193954	1201021	You may remember that's a service that's been available right now on Xbox Live as their kind of digital download service.
1201601	1209409	And of course, trying to compete with Steam a little bit, I think, they're going to start doing their Games on Demand service starting the beginning of December 15th.
1211218	1232234	and apparently some of the games that they're talking about adding for the initial lineup is going to be Resident Evil 5, Red Faction Guerrilla, Battle Stations Pacific, as well as some Game for Windows Live enabled versions of World of Goo and Osmos.
1233955	1234175	Hmm.
1235396	1235516	And...
1237386	1238567	I don't know, that's kind of interesting.
1238607	1242912	They haven't really said any prices yet on what the games will cost.
1243013	1247558	Well, I imagine a lot of it's going to be competitively priced or similar to what you see on store shelves.
1248679	1250481	That's pretty much what we've come to expect from Steam.
1250802	1255227	But I think a large reason people really like Steam is that they do sales all the freaking time.
1255447	1261151	And if I remember correctly, I believe, isn't Games for Windows Live kind of tied in with Windows 7 a little bit?
1261191	1269956	Because I remember when they were showing us some of the stuff for Windows 7, there was kind of that game marketplace or whatever that you could download, like a bunch of casual stuff and whatnot.
1270377	1273399	I just upgraded to 7 a week ago.
1273419	1274059	Well...
1275960	1304849	I've been running it on my laptop because remember we got the release candidate at E3 like many of you out there on the internet downloaded so I've been running that on my laptop for some time ever since I got it in July and that's what made me decide that I like Windows 7 I like it much more than the jump from XP to Vista because what I liked about 7 is it takes the best parts of Vista and what you remember liking about XP kind of puts it together the one thing I don't like about 7 is I cannot stand these administrator privileges things I want to freaking get them removed
1305289	1307192	It's the one thing I didn't... It's in Vista too.
1307492	1307913	Yeah, I know.
1307933	1309896	I didn't like it in Vista either.
1310196	1311718	There should be a way I can disable that crap.
1311738	1312500	You can't disable it.
1312900	1313281	Can you?
1313501	1317306	Well, in Vista, all you have to do is make yourself full administrator and then just do...
1318913	1322716	It took me a while to change it, to find where to change it, but it is there.
1322836	1323356	It should be there.
1323396	1328880	To be fair, I haven't looked hard enough, and I'm sure our chat room is going to light up with comments on things I could be doing better in a minute here.
1329480	1330761	And I'll have to look into that in the next week.
1330781	1336185	But I was just having problems because it was not letting me delete World of Warcraft folders because it said I didn't create them.
1336505	1341808	And I had to go in this really – like I had to right-click on the folder, go into properties, make myself the new owner.
1341888	1342869	It was ridiculous.
1343089	1345911	I should just be able to hit the delete key and nuke the fucking folder.
1346011	1348894	I should not have to jump hurdles to delete my own goddamn game.
1349134	1349434	You know?
1349634	1350135	It's stupid.
1350435	1351436	That's the one drawback.
1351516	1352617	Otherwise, I love Windows 7.
1354639	1358622	And to be fair, Vista has a lot of that administrative... So, you know what?
1360764	1362345	Just run Linux Mint, Rob.
1364026	1365808	I'm not going to run Linux Mint on a desktop.
1366008	1370071	I'd run it on my laptop, but running that stuff on my desktop, I can't do it.
1370592	1371953	It will run more efficiently...
1372955	1373575	On a laptop?
1373876	1374016	No.
1374096	1374516	I can't.
1374616	1375496	It runs more efficiently.
1375516	1376957	Why don't you run it on your desktop then?
1377097	1379318	Because I actually have to have programs that use a Windows environment.
1379398	1382740	Well, I use a lot of movie makers and stuff like that that's Windows environment.
1382900	1384681	So, you know, that's where I'm coming from.
1385101	1390084	You know, for a laptop though, like, you know, I kind of like... Mint 8's out now.
1391253	1396535	I know you're not a big fan of Google Chrome, but I like where that's headed as far as a laptop OS goes.
1396915	1402337	That it's just the internet, the documents, the stuff you want to do on the go.
1403817	1407879	But I could never... God, Google Chrome, I could never run on a desktop.
1408979	1411320	I don't think that it's actually meant for desktop use though.
1411480	1412141	I don't think so either.
1412241	1415482	But Mint is fairly versatile.
1416002	1434771	In fact, actually the other thing that I was going to be doing with my computer when the semester's over is actually doing a second install for Mint 8 because I was going to run some of the Windows emulated environments because apparently they actually run pretty well using less system resource than Vista or Windows 7 does.
1435451	1435591	Hmm.
1435971	1439812	So, actually, all those 5 gigs of RAM, I can actually use it for my graphics programs.
1440913	1443634	You know, I might give it a try.
1445054	1447035	I am not a fan of Windows.
1448255	1449496	I use it out of necessity.
1450236	1452337	And lately, I've been even less of a fan of macOS.
1453577	1458599	Yeah, there's things I really, really like about the Mac, and there's things I really, really don't like about the Mac.
1459721	1460201	Me too.
1461001	1475044	Well, it's one thing that I've actually been pretty happy that finally Adobe has gotten their crap together and made CS4 actually really, really wonderfully compatible with a PC environment.
1475304	1477164	It's got everything optimized for your graphics cards.
1477344	1487306	I can run Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign, and Corel Painter and the internet and AIM and all this other crap at the same time without my system just farting.
1487906	1488166	Nice.
1488626	1488786	So...
1489741	1489961	All right.
1490422	1493764	And just another quick note, because I see a lot of chatter saying that they're hearing a lot of typing.
1493905	1498789	I think something's up with Jamie's mic tonight, and it's more sensitive than usual, which is strange, because we didn't change any of the dials.
1498829	1501011	But, you know, things happen when things get shifted around.
1501291	1503052	So I think it's just ultra sensitive tonight.
1503072	1504734	And I've been typing on the microphone.
1505996	1506136	No.
1506456	1509379	So I'm just saying, we know you guys are hearing it, we just don't know why.
1509499	1514303	So one of the beauties of live radio is that sometimes we have to figure things out on the fly.
1514323	1516385	It's the whole newsroom vibe, okay?
1516445	1516645	Yes.
1516665	1519488	It's the typewriters.
1519548	1520789	Live for the OLR newsroom.
1520809	1525032	Yeah, we just totally need to have the Morse code ticker going in the background.
1525052	1526634	Good night and have a pleasant tomorrow.
1529747	1535811	Anyhow, sorry, going back to games for Windows Live, because damn, we got on a whole tangent about Windows 7.
1536111	1541555	The point I was trying to get to earlier, I've been running Windows 7 for months now and I haven't seen it.
1541996	1544517	There was the point I was trying to make seven minutes ago.
1546419	1552303	Anyway, the other thing I wanted to say, though, about this, Loki, I don't think you really use any of this stuff.
1552823	1553944	Do you even have a Steam account?
1553964	1554004	No.
1556056	1556296	Nope.
1556636	1557557	No, I figured.
1558097	1559137	Why would you have a Steam account?
1559758	1561058	Why would I pay for software?
1561278	1562019	I don't know.
1562399	1564740	Call it supporting developers, maybe?
1564860	1565260	I don't know.
1565340	1565780	Call me crazy.
1565880	1568361	Honestly, I don't play enough PC games to have that.
1568622	1575265	Final Fantasy XI is the last PC game I remember you actually playing more than an hour of.
1576205	1577906	I played Crysis and Spore.
1581578	1586881	Actually, the last Games for Windows live game that I purchased was Grand Theft Auto 4 for the PC.
1587621	1588022	Oh, okay.
1588202	1603670	And I actually stopped playing that because I got tired of trying to monkey with stuff to get it to... I don't know why games nowadays, some of them don't support multiple graphics cards.
1603950	1605591	And it's really sad that they don't.
1606991	1607531	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1627809	1628790	You don't buy computers.
1628810	1629991	You build computers.
1630151	1631933	No, I should have built the goddamn computer.
1633134	1635796	It was $800, and I was like, oh, this is a great deal.
1635836	1637117	It's got like six gigs of RAM.
1637157	1638499	I'm like, I can't build one that cheap.
1638559	1639299	I was stupid.
1639379	1639940	You can.
1640020	1640921	Bad judgment.
1641061	1641561	I admit it.
1642662	1646746	How dare I doubt the great and mighty Loki, and I pay for it every day of my life.
1646846	1647387	I just built...
1648735	1649235	Lesson learned.
1650817	1653078	I just built a PC for my mom, actually.
1653359	1659663	It's sadly almost, well, not quite up to spec to what mine is, because mine was built for gaming, but $350.
1661004	1664827	It gets incredibly cheap to do it nowadays.
1665348	1669851	If you actually go piece by piece of what they actually include in there, you can see where they're cutting corners.
1670192	1677918	Well, I need a new video card, because Dragon Age kind of runs like balls on my computer, but then I watched my friend play it on his computer this weekend, and it's like, oh, beautiful.
1678698	1680960	And you can do rotating and things that you can't do on the console.
1681000	1682961	So I'm like, must play Dragon Age.
1682981	1683841	This game is beautiful.
1684402	1684882	And I can't.
1685543	1687944	Because my video card is balls because I didn't trust Loki.
1689885	1690226	Anyhow.
1690426	1692087	Well, that'll be the last time they do that.
1692830	1693771	Akira Yamaoka Akira Yamaoka
1712794	1713914	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1735422	1739543	OutSourced it, or well, not outsourced it, but had a US developer do Homecoming or what have you.
1740023	1741624	And I don't know, maybe that's part of what ticked him off.
1741744	1742364	I have no idea.
1742464	1744025	Or maybe, you know, after 16 years he wanted a new job.
1744045	1746325	That he just doesn't get along with people from what I understand.
1746505	1746765	Really?
1747366	1750727	Well... He was nice at E3 that one year we randomly met him.
1750867	1752227	Yeah, he was pretty cool.
1752347	1754168	And I mean, I was like, ha ha ha.
1755068	1756628	But anyway... In your pants.
1758129	1764591	But seriously, I just, you know, maybe he just got tired of dealing with all the crap going on.
1765359	1766060	And we don't know.
1766080	1768442	We can speculate until the cows come home, but we don't know.
1768482	1769784	There's been no official statement made.
1770044	1773227	But you also look at it and go, okay, he was there for, what, 16 years?
1773688	1775750	I mean, that's a long time to be at any job.
1776211	1777752	And sometimes people just want to change.
1778173	1784419	Maybe he's doing that whole thing where it's like, okay, I've been with this band, and now I want to split off and make a solo album.
1784439	1784880	And...
1786141	1786982	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
1804680	1806982	And he scored things even all the way back to the 8-bit days.
1807602	1812166	I know he did the Contra game that was on... He did some of Super Contra's soundtrack, I think.
1812406	1814087	He's just done a lot of stuff over the years.
1814147	1816149	I'm sure the wiki has the whole list about that.
1817950	1818711	We wish him the best.
1818771	1820632	Good luck to Akira Yamaoka.
1820933	1824796	And again, we would really like to see you form a new studio and make some more scary games.
1824976	1825616	He should hire me.
1826577	1826917	He should.
1827397	1827658	He should.
1827678	1828498	He should hire me, too.
1828578	1833142	I am particularly crazy enough to be able to help with the whole Silent Hill... Anyway.
1834124	1835385	You just want to be raped by Pyramid Head.
1836426	1836706	No.
1839047	1839468	No.
1842009	1843511	Not just no, but no.
1843531	1844231	Ew.
1845692	1849094	One does not just ask Pyramid Head to rape them.
1849875	1852597	Besides that, he has... You have to be chosen by Pyramid Head.
1852617	1855479	Besides that, he only bones the monsters.
1855839	1856319	Ah, I see.
1857880	1858581	I'm not a nurse.
1858701	1859041	Sorry.
1860322	1862344	Well, how about some game banning?
1863422	1863962	or not.
1864363	1865123	This is stupid.
1866044	1873148	Yeah, so the Australian classification board says that Sega can't have it for Aliens vs. Predators.
1873188	1876070	That means that they actually cannot sell it in Australia the way it is now.
1876090	1876931	It's...
1879392	1894882	They're saying that because you've got human beings being tortured and violated and decapitated and dismembered and lots of stabbing through different parts of the body that no.
1895403	1895863	They said no.
1896523	1900406	And Sega Australia is like, we're going to still appeal it.
1901087	1902287	because this is kind of stupid.
1902367	1905648	Well, and that's just what you do when your game gets a bad rating.
1905688	1915591	I mean, have we ever heard a game company ever in the history of this show, you know, XY game gets banned and the company says, ah, okay, well, you know, these things happen.
1915731	1916471	Well, we try it.
1917112	1917512	That's right.
1917592	1918252	Nope, cancel it.
1918792	1919832	Merry Christmas to you now.
1919972	1920232	Oh well.
1920593	1921333	Oh well.
1921373	1921873	Happy Christmas.
1923067	1924708	That's a ballsy thing to do.
1924728	1924808	Yeah.
1924868	1925009	Yeah.
1945612	1948593	You know, one thing I got to see this week was the Left 4 Dead.
1948613	1949574	You know, it's on YouTube.
1949594	1956637	If you go look for the Left 4 Dead 2, you can look at the censored version in Australia and kind of compare it to the regular one.
1957157	1960699	And, man, you guys in Australia got shafted on Left 4 Dead 2.
1961319	1963400	It's like the zombies, like, disappear.
1963980	1968342	Like, I was waiting for the bodies to flicker before they disappear, like it was Double Dragon or something.
1968402	1973444	I mean, it was not pleasant how desanitized they had to make that game.
1973784	1974485	It's unfortunate.
1974505	1975005	Do you still want to...
1975560	1979181	It's like the dingo ate my decapitation scenes.
1979281	1981122	Do you still want to go over there?
1981862	1982502	What, to Australia?
1982642	1982822	Yeah.
1982842	1983803	Well, I want to go visit.
1984183	1984943	But you don't want to live there.
1985043	1988744	That's because I have an unhealthy obsession with a lot of Australian movies over the years.
1990465	1992625	And I want to see somebody play a didgeridoo.
1993365	1996026	Did I tell you I saw someone play a didgeridoo at school?
1996166	1997967	It's not authentic if it's not in Australia.
1998447	2002188	Just like if you have a pineapple here, it's not the same as having a pineapple in Hawaii.
2002228	2002568	I'm sorry.
2002768	2004689	But he built it out of PVC pipe.
2006414	2007675	That's not a didgeridoo.
2007715	2011738	But it sounded right and the guy was sitting outside at school.
2011758	2013320	That's a PVC redo or something.
2013700	2015401	PVC redo.
2015561	2016142	Didgeridoo.
2017643	2018564	I took a picture of it too.
2019624	2020105	It was funny.
2021397	2022738	Wow, wow, wow.
2022818	2024018	Well, look, people, you know what?
2024579	2031062	If this game comes out on PC, which almost all these games do nowadays, what's going to stop them from just importing the PC version of the game?
2031142	2033944	I mean, do they region lock out PC games?
2034144	2035685	I don't think that's a very easy thing to do.
2035705	2036225	No, you can't.
2036425	2037346	There is no regions.
2037766	2039407	You can if it runs on a DVD.
2040847	2041668	Oh, I guess that makes sense.
2042352	2046394	But isn't Australia... Australia's in the same region as Britain though, right?
2046414	2050116	But you can't... No, if it's on DVD, DVD video only has regions.
2050177	2052198	DVD software does not have regions at all.
2053218	2056160	So there's no way to lock out anything.
2056340	2060582	I guess maybe because we're thinking like PS2 would do the region lockouts, but of course that's different.
2061023	2061343	Interesting.
2061363	2066586	Yeah, and even if they did, it would just get bypassed so easy it's not even worth it.
2067925	2071026	Somebody in the chat room, of course, made the reference to Didgeridoo Techno.
2071446	2075747	I was an inside joke on this show from like a year and a half ago, but maybe we'll have to play that on break tonight.
2076308	2076888	It's been a little while.
2077108	2078588	And don't forget the references to Kylie.
2078688	2080149	We haven't had Didgeridoo Techno in a while.
2080169	2081509	We should play some Kylie during the break.
2081789	2082129	We'll see.
2083230	2087091	I had an old school chiptune song all picked out, but we'll see.
2087491	2087711	We'll see.
2088151	2089872	Anyhow, we're going to move on with more news.
2091192	2091972	Sorry, Australia.
2092773	2096474	You should write your legislators and tell them they're crap.
2098320	2098580	DarkSakura.com
2116684	2117565	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2136511	2148228	So there's a rumor that by the end of the year actually, or I guess near future, you're going to be able to play your PSP minis on your PlayStation 3.
2150071	2151613	So there's basically kind of...
2153177	2154358	I don't know, you can look at it two ways.
2154519	2163809	One, they're allowing you more customers, I guess, to purchase these PSP minis, which is neat that they would allow you to be able to play it.
2163889	2169575	Two, they don't have very much confidence in the PlayStation portable platform in order to...
2172136	2174958	PSP Minis are not up to expectations right now.
2198423	2206088	Um, maybe because the PlayStation Portable, I mean, the PSP Go's, I mean, obviously are all digital.
2206548	2220157	Most people with PSPs probably aren't really interested in download games, whereas, you know, they're more interested in kind of the retail stuff, because that way if they don't like it, they can send it back, or they can rent it, or they can try it out, and that kind of stuff.
2220917	2224760	And maybe just some of these games, like, you know,
2227124	2228426	Tetris they put out there.
2228466	2231149	I mean, who hasn't played Tetris and really do it?
2232029	2233371	Here's one reason why the PSP minis.
2233391	2235533	Here's my proof on why the PSP minis is doing well.
2235553	2237395	And here's a game you can play along with at home.
2237435	2237775	You ready?
2238276	2238536	Okay.
2239157	2239417	Quick.
2239797	2243201	Name one PSP minigame that's been released that wasn't Sudoku or Tetris.
2243241	2243421	Ready?
2243501	2243701	Go.
2245003	2246584	I don't know.
2246604	2248346	Oh, that's why they're not doing well.
2248366	2249888	Because there's nothing of note.
2252481	2253723	XNA Lacrosse Game PSP Minis
2267338	2273965	I've got to mention this that's come up in our chat because it's not on the show roll tonight but it's something I have to bring up because I really want to hear what Loki has to say to this.
2274446	2282154	Salacious Poppin Chat says there was some sort of Logitech rumor this week about them considering making a UMD add-on for the Go.
2283176	2284257	And they already denied it.
2284710	2285330	Have they denied it?
2285490	2285970	Yeah.
2287311	2288011	Let's imagine.
2288051	2295934	Let's go to the land of make-believe with King Friday and everybody for a minute and imagine that this rumor were true.
2296334	2297154	What would you be saying?
2297834	2300275	That's the most retarded thing I've ever heard.
2300735	2309521	Yes, let me buy a more expensive system that's like almost $100 more expensive than the actual normal system, which includes this peripheral.
2309781	2315985	And then buy an additional peripheral to be able to have the same features as the cheaper system.
2316326	2323130	So you're asking me to spend more money for the system initially and more money on top of that to buy a feature that should have been there in the first place.
2323710	2324691	Sure, sign me up.
2326292	2328654	My reply to that would be, but meow meow this.
2332376	2333337	I see what you did there.
2333797	2334257	Yes, you did.
2334517	2337639	And like half of our listeners aren't even going to get it because they didn't watch Mr. Rogers Neighborhood.
2337659	2341621	No, plenty more are not going to understand what you just did, but I laughed very hard.
2342302	2343282	Rob, that was for your benefit.
2343302	2343622	Thank you.
2343682	2344223	I appreciate it.
2344243	2346484	And Rob, I think that's so meow meow stupid.
2346604	2349646	I think this show should simply exist to amuse me.
2349766	2351047	Otherwise, what the hell are we doing?
2351087	2352727	We're just wasting our goddamn time.
2353168	2354989	We do this show every week so you can bring me coffee.
2355669	2365856	I was hoping that Logitech rumor was true, because it would just be the nice bullet point to the failure of the PSP Go.
2365896	2369858	It's like, and there's the ribbon for the package of failure right there.
2372280	2376563	And that's what they should call the add-on, Logitech package of failure for the PSP Go.
2378064	2382587	Well, you already spent the money already, so apparently you're going to buy extra crap for it as well.
2384178	2385159	I didn't know how to respond to that.
2385179	2386680	What were you going to say?
2407960	2415679	or you could just, I don't know give up on the UMD format as a format for movies since they've stopped making them anyways
2416494	2422297	I don't know, I never really saw any reason to... Because I already have that on Laserdisc somewhere.
2422317	2422878	And you know what?
2423058	2425139	You know why the PSP minis suck?
2425519	2428661	It's because they've already had the PSP download games already.
2429041	2433883	There was absolutely no need to add PSP minis as another form of download games.
2433903	2436965	Well, I like the idea of cheaper games, just so we don't have anything of note.
2437005	2437886	Now, to be fair...
2438817	2439417	Thanks for watching!
2461514	2462535	I got nothing.
2462655	2464016	There's just nothing very of note.
2464596	2467578	And I do feel bad for the Sony fans.
2467598	2468158	Well, no, I don't.
2468298	2472701	But we habitually bash the PSP Go on this show.
2473021	2477023	But honestly, Sony, it's just time to give the PSP Go an abortion.
2477564	2482607	I realize it's already out of the womb, but just stuff it in the face with a pillow and end the PSP Go.
2483227	2484388	Because the PSP is a great system.
2484728	2485108	Go back to the 3.
2485649	2485929	It's great.
2486289	2511942	PSP's great, it's all it's internet, mp3s, movies all right there, it's great just stop it with the go stop it and it wouldn't have been that hard to I mean seriously all they would have had to do is make a PSP 4000 or whatever and have internal storage built into it so okay look we've got an internal drive and all the same features that you liked before and that would have been just fine
2512695	2514716	Brad from PopCulture asked an interesting question in chat.
2514776	2519078	How is the add-on any different than a cart adapter for the GameCube or SNES?
2519358	2523320	Well, in both those cases, you were taking portable systems and putting them on your TV.
2523921	2525882	And I think that was the point of those.
2525982	2534286	Whereas this Logitech adapter is taking something that they took away and putting it back because you realized it never should have been gone in the first place.
2535233	2560625	If that makes any sense, I don't know I think that's the difference to me To be fair, those other adapters on the GameCube were a little silly as well Although the Super Game Boy did let you tweak the colors Silly, superficial things that weren't there to begin with At least something But at least, I don't know It's sort of like the HD DVD add-on to the Xbox 360
2563165	2566174	Something that they could have put in at launch, but they didn't.
2567558	2569403	And no one's missing it now.
2570866	2571266	We'll see.
2571366	2585950	I mean, maybe, again, in a year's time, we'll be singing a different tune, but I still think the PSP Go by that time will be... I think if they literally put this out, first off, it would have been Sony putting this out, not Logitech, although I can see why they do Logitech, so that way they wouldn't look as bad.
2586371	2587551	It would still be bad enough.
2588271	2591672	And right there, it's just like, oh, look, you don't have confidence in your system.
2591972	2593953	And how the hell would they manage to hack that?
2594433	2598454	And let's just say, for argument's sake, they were able to, I don't know...
2600057	2604678	Make that device and have it connect to their memory card slot or something like that to read UMDs.
2604858	2610560	It would be hacked in seconds and it would be a big old backdoor to the whole PSP Go.
2610620	2614381	It's not going to end up pretty for them.
2615081	2616241	Which is why they need to do it.
2616401	2620222	So that people can hack the Go even easier.
2622110	2623411	DarkSakura had a game of the week once.
2645447	2645747	DarkSakura.com
2661460	2661981	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2681866	2682806	Thanks for watching!
2702176	2705998	And I know Jamie's probably all over that, assuming it doesn't suck.
2706558	2708039	Although it looks like it might be fun.
2708079	2709299	It looks like it's like four players.
2709880	2711020	That could be kind of chaotic.
2711680	2714022	If four players are going at the grid all at once, that could be interesting.
2714322	2714702	That could be.
2714902	2717163	That's probably its big thing.
2717243	2720224	It probably has online, everybody kind of attacks it all at once.
2721065	2721465	Could be cool.
2723346	2726927	Well, how about something that we kind of already knew?
2727408	2727568	Hmm.
2729046	2737633	Yeah, so you know the rumor was going on for a long time that a lot of the music in Sonic 3 had been done by Michael Jackson?
2739034	2744178	Yes, I've heard that rumor before because the credits music sounds like Stranger in Moscow, right?
2744278	2746920	And Casino Night from Scream, the same thing.
2747205	2747685	Ah, that's right.
2747946	2750087	Yeah, the little triplet part.
2750267	2750807	But anyway, yeah.
2751067	2754870	So it was confirmed that he did it, but he was not happy with it.
2755290	2758032	So he wanted himself uncredited and the music altered.
2759553	2762915	But he, of course, kept a lot of the same elements to use in his own music.
2763766	2770075	That's kind of a bummer for Sega, because imagine if they could have marketed that Sonic 3 had a Michael freaking Jackson soundtrack.
2770115	2772138	I mean, that would have been huge for them.
2772158	2780070	I mean, it's not like Sonic 3 was a little game anyway, but there'd be a lot of people that would have taken a huge interest in this game knowing that Michael Jackson had been involved.
2781386	2792777	There's also, I actually remember there being interviews ahead of time that they said that they were getting Michael Jackson's involvement for the musical direction on one of the games.
2794239	2797081	Because, I mean, that was in a magazine back when.
2797101	2797582	Yeah.
2799366	2825272	but the whole point was that, and this is a quote from actually an interview with Michael Jackson's composer Brad Buxer saying that at the time, this is a quote, at the time game consoles did not allow optimal sound reproduction and Michael found it frustrating he did not want to be associated with a product that devalued his music so what about Moonwalker, huh?
2828490	2830532	Well, Moonwalker was kind of a rat in the arcades.
2831092	2831953	I mean, at the time.
2832933	2835776	Now you look back and go, this is something better left in my memory.
2836056	2836837	It came out on Genesis?
2837237	2837597	That's true.
2838278	2841060	I thought it was a pretty good rendition of Smooth Criminal.
2841423	2843144	Now, Salacious Pop was thinking what I was thinking.
2843204	2845425	At least there's always Space Channel 5 with Space Michael.
2845645	2846946	Space Channel 5.
2847806	2848847	By the way, have you ever heard this?
2848907	2850108	And I think this is the right YouTube.
2850148	2852209	I came across this earlier this week when I was reading about the story.
2852509	2853910	I've actually got one that I can link you.
2854230	2854510	Do you?
2854730	2855470	Okay.
2855510	2860853	Have you heard this hybrid one that's actually the credits and Michael Jackson, Stranger in Moscow over each other?
2861113	2862094	I'll play a little clip of this here.
2865696	2866376	Yes, I have heard that.
2880202	2885583	By the way, I do think the Sonic 3 credit music is some of the best video game music from that era.
2886044	2890285	So it is pretty neat to know that Michael Jackson indeed had something to do with that.
2892125	2894806	Oh yeah, the Ice Cap Zone thing, huh?
2894846	2896126	I'm going to link it to you right now.
2896206	2901768	Alright, let's try to get this played here and then we'll move on with another story.
2902628	2906689	In fact, while I load that up, maybe we'll start moving into release dates this week.
2907049	2909410	Loki, why don't you start off with the US releases and then we'll come back to this.
2910482	2911823	This week's not a lot coming out.
2913183	2920305	Pretty much your big game is going to be The Saboteur, coming out on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and PC.
2921366	2932549	Also this week, though, we do have one, I guess, well, apparently now one of the last Akira Yamaoka Silent Hill games, Silent Hill Shattered Memories, coming out on the Wii this week.
2934270	2935770	I have to pick that up.
2935970	2937071	I really like that at E3.
2937091	2937911	I hope it doesn't disappoint.
2938396	2940098	No, it looks freaking awesome.
2940358	2943101	Yeah, well, Nintendogs looked awesome too.
2943141	2943782	That's all I'm saying.
2944002	2945484	Yeah, but Nintendogs was awesome.
2945524	2949729	It's just, unfortunately, we didn't get to play it longer than five minutes at E3.
2949749	2949989	So, you know...
2952796	2956700	We thought it was good for longer than five, but really it was only good for five.
2957661	2961164	Of course, this week, Legend of Zelda Spirit Tracks on the DS.
2962586	2967371	And then there's some small crap that's littering the rest of the week.
2967911	2976259	Rec Room for the Wii, Puzzler World for the DS, which is a puzzle minigame compilation.
2977640	2999686	James Cameron's Avatar The Game out on PSP because I believe it's delayed from the rest of them and and that's about it actually alright let me go back to those YouTubes real quick before I get into the Japanese releases let's see this is the Who Is It mixed with Ice Cap Zone music?
2999886	3005568	yeah oops I still have my wave muted live radio fail
3017335	3017756	Carameldansen
3046474	3047294	Dude, I like this.
3047394	3050635	It's kind of neat.
3050795	3053916	It's so cool now that that game just has so much added value.
3053956	3061079	Even though this is kind of one of those things everybody always suspected anyway, but I think a lot of people were like, did Michael Jackson rip off Sonic because it was one of his favorite?
3061619	3063600	But now it's like, no, he fucking wrote it.
3063620	3066221	He just took the stuff he already did.
3066421	3068521	I think it's amazing.
3068601	3072963	A couple more things I was going to mention real quick for release dates, even though it's not next week, but...
3073843	3079286	There's a couple of the Konami Classic volumes that are coming out on Xbox 360 for $20 each.
3079667	3082248	And actually, there's a couple that are pretty good deals.
3082889	3086171	The first one is... Are these just like the live arcade games?
3086191	3087131	These are live arcade games.
3087151	3087972	Like what PopCap does.
3088212	3088792	That's pretty sweet.
3089072	3092495	They've got Castlevania Symphony of the Night, Frogger, and Super Contra.
3092755	3093055	That's for $20.
3093095	3097738	The other one that they have is Track and Field, Russian Attack, and Contra.
3099150	3117137	so Russian Attack by the way I bet is one of those arcade games you probably didn't play growing up at least I didn't but it was actually a lot of fun on Xbox Live Arcade for five bucks wasn't a bad deal anyhow so that's what they're available for now I'm not sure if they've dropped in price enough to where that's actually not a good deal anymore but three games for 20 bucks
3117717	3119479	Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 Samurai Spirits Zen Samurai Shodown
3143126	3146088	It's from SNK, so that is getting released on the 360 this week.
3146868	3148929	Some fighting game fans are going to be very happy about that.
3149549	3150910	I know that series has its fans.
3151910	3159794	Also on PlayStation 3, Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 is out over there as well, as well as X-Edge or Cross-Edge.
3160814	3166417	Of course, next week is Final Fantasy XIII, and I know a lot of you over here in America are going to be importing that.
3166957	3168197	Tales of Graces Tales of Sinfonia Tales of Graces
3194628	3198109	Man, I remember playing Deshinden 3 on PlayStation.
3198670	3199130	There it is.
3199330	3200730	Now you get a version on the Nintendo Wii.
3200850	3202991	I don't know if it's a ported version of the game or what it is.
3203111	3204532	Oh, no, it's a redo.
3204612	3207013	Actually, I remember seeing the trailer for it.
3207173	3207333	Yeah?
3207513	3209934	Yeah, and it looked just as crappy as all the other ones, which means I have to play it.
3211361	3237421	PlayStation 2 you know the releases are dying down over there in Japan just like they are over here but I do want to point out World Soccer winning 11 2010 is coming out in Japan for you soccer fans Nintendo DS Luminous Arc 3 comes out on the DS this week and lastly on the PSP Bleach Soul Carnival 2 makes its way out in Japan as well as yet another Naruto game Naruto Shippuden Narutomit Excel 3
3239150	3241692	and WorldSoccerWinning11 on PSP.
3242272	3243413	There you have it for Japanese releases.
3244053	3247555	Well, we've got just a few notable ones for the UK.
3248035	3256841	On the 10th, Pixel Junk Shooter on PlayStation 3 and then on the 11th we have Tekken 6 on PSP and The Legend of Zelda Spirit Tracks on DS.
3258642	3259102	Very cool.
3260623	3268668	Alright, so back to some more gaming news then and then we're going to get into the Classic Game of the Week before too long here and of course our Part B in just a little while.
3272205	3272945	This is kind of cool.
3273445	3278047	You may remember we talked a little bit about this before.
3279327	3285550	Kind of the whole play, create, share games that they've got now on the PlayStation 3.
3285810	3288491	Well, the second one in the series is Mod Nation Racers.
3289271	3292192	And, of course, it's kind of like build your own Mario Kart type game.
3293243	3298306	But they are, just like they did with LittleBigPlanet, they're going to be having a beta.
3298706	3299867	And it actually starts this month.
3300567	3303009	And there's a few ways you could be in that beta.
3303629	3306151	One is, of course, if you bought... Blowing someone at Sony.
3306571	3307431	That's one way you can do it.
3308152	3308592	That might work.
3309353	3313755	One is if you bought the LittleBigPlanet Game of the Year Edition, which have a code that came inside the box.
3314916	3319539	And then, of course, you can also sign up online for a chance to participate as well.
3320612	3349305	and that of course can be done at us.playstation.com slash modnation slash online beta and you can go ahead and sign up there also you can be an existing subscriber to core or subscribe on or before December 15th to receive a voucher as well and you can check out the pretty awesome game which still no one has announced that it's going to be on PSP but it is going to be on PSP you heard it here first
3351092	3353713	Well, it also doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure that out.
3354253	3355013	I mean, to be fair.
3355734	3359195	But it would be nice to have that confirmed by Sony at some point.
3360015	3363436	But you know, someday they'll decide to say it and it'll be a big surprise, except not really.
3363796	3365997	But I'm actually very much looking forward to Mod Nation's Racer.
3366097	3373099	I think this does look like another game that's going to be like a must-have on the PS3, so I'm very excited to see that.
3373900	3374300	So we'll see.
3375404	3376364	I was just reading in chat.
3376985	3377305	What's that?
3377465	3382386	Bon006 said, I think the gay marriage bill was just passed here in New York.
3382967	3383607	On a Sunday night?
3384127	3390009	Well, I... Well, checking the news.
3390249	3396491	There was one that failed a couple days ago in the New York Senate, I think it was.
3397391	3398232	Let us know if you find out.
3398352	3399412	Yeah, I'd be curious too.
3400913	3401933	You know, it'd be about time.
3404804	3405625	Live in the now, people.
3406085	3411509	Also, coming to the now, which I'm very excited about, Sunsoft!
3412310	3414511	Rise from your grave!
3414831	3416392	Okay, that wasn't a Sunsoft game, but still.
3417073	3418034	You might remember Sunsoft.
3418054	3424418	They made some cool 8-bit games back in the day, one of which, of course, near and dear to all of our hearts, Fester's Quest.
3425139	3425579	No, I'm kidding.
3425619	3426319	Blaster Master.
3426520	3427780	Although Fester's Quest wasn't that bad.
3428061	3429742	But Blaster Master was made by Sunsoft.
3430002	3431383	Yeah, it wasn't that bad.
3431543	3432504	For me to poop on...
3434059	3437440	Hey, I got that game for Christmas, one Christmas, and I played it for like a week straight.
3438181	3440041	It wasn't terrible, except it was very strange.
3440101	3444063	Like, aliens land in the Addams Family back... forget it.
3444543	3445283	Blaster Master!
3445343	3446184	Fuck everything else!
3446244	3447424	You have Blaster Master!
3447704	3449205	Who cares what else Sunsoft did?
3449245	3450425	They did Blaster Master.
3451005	3457468	And sure enough, that is the first thing they are planning to release now on the NES Virtual Console is Blaster Master.
3457788	3466713	Unfortunately, it's not like a WiiWare souped-up version or anything like that, but the Wii Virtual Console release of Blaster Master, 500 Wii Points, apparently coming out this month.
3467836	3472479	By the way, the whole reason this is happening is because Sunsoft is actually resuming operations in North America.
3472759	3475301	They're having a little help from a company called Gaijin Works.
3475861	3478943	And Gaijin Works made Miami Law for the Nintendo DS.
3479263	3481365	It was part of Working Designs.
3482245	3485247	Victor Ireland left them and kind of made this and so forth.
3485287	3488349	When Working Designs closed, da-da-da-da-da, one thing led to another.
3488710	3490391	So now we have Sunsoft.
3491391	3493112	Quote coming from Ireland...
3494233	3495454	Did you say Victor Ireland?
3495554	3497816	Yes, from Working Designs We have his Twilight Zone
3523012	3523333	Really?
3523573	3523814	Yes.
3524114	3526941	Well, he's the guy you can thank for bringing Sunsoft back to life.
3527101	3527542	Thank you.
3527903	3529226	And thank you for your pinball table.
3529467	3530890	Wait, do you have his contact information then?
3531531	3532093	Um, Dan might.
3538728	3545571	Dan actually bought his Twilight Zone and so he gave us you know that Goemon doll that I have?
3546271	3552814	He gave us a Goemon doll because they had a whole bunch of them because they were supposed to be for pre-ordering the Goemon game that they never brought out.
3553424	3557127	Let's see, here's some of the other big things that Sunsoft did.
3557267	3558228	Arrow the Acrobat.
3559189	3561191	They did the Blaster Master series, of course.
3561231	3565034	They did some of the Batman games, like the original Batman on the NES, which was not too bad.
3566115	3568838	Let's see, they did Fester's Quest, of course.
3569938	3576104	Some of the Final Fantasy Legend, I guess, games were translated by them, or localized, or whatever you want to say, by them.
3577485	3579167	Freedom Force, lol.
3580467	3601834	Lemmings on the NES they did a lot of NES ports of games that were big on other systems like Fantasy Zone on the NES was Sunsoft you remember how they had like a version of that that was done by Sunsoft so hmm very interesting Spy Hunter on the NES was them as well as Super Spy Hunter hmm I'd be very curious to see what they have planned
3603382	3603762	We'll see.
3604422	3614007	I would love for some type of sequel to Blaster Master because clearly that's their huge, huge franchise and something better than the one that was on Genesis because the one that was on Genesis, not so great.
3615307	3621830	Anyhow, speaking of stuff worthy of the virtual console, we're going to take a trip down memory lane in a segment we like to call the Classic Game of the Week.
3624127	3632915	and every week in the Classic Video Game of the Week segment, DarkSakura takes a trip to the video game vault and pulls out a game that she thinks, damn it, you ought to be playing this game.
3632975	3643165	You young whippersnappers need to dust off your NES or SNES or, as in the case of a lot of these games, Sega-related systems and play this game.
3644106	3645768	So, DarkSakura, what is the Classic Game of the Week?
3646188	3646728	Final Fight.
3647749	3649251	Ah, a topically inspired game, I see.
3650086	3652669	Yep, I got inspired by last week.
3652809	3655872	Although, actually, it was also when I went and picked up my box of Final Fight Guy.
3655892	3657333	I was like, oh yeah, I should do this.
3658274	3659335	Because I found the box.
3659675	3660796	Hold on for a second, play some music.
3661037	3661577	Alright, sure.
3665601	3672368	This is the final boss fight in Final Fight Guy, which really would be the same as the regular Final Fight 2, but fighting Belger.
3678124	3680585	I'm sorry, I had to get the box because we're going to take a picture of it.
3681125	3681505	Wow.
3682466	3684646	You'll have to put that on the picture site.
3684726	3685026	I will.
3685066	3688247	Blockbuster exclusive, direct from Japan, Final Fantasy Guy.
3688848	3689508	Final Fight Guy.
3689548	3691729	I'm sorry, Final Fight Guy.
3691809	3693389	I wish I didn't say Fatal Fury Guy.
3693449	3694390	I've done that before, too.
3694410	3699831	This one I had my whole little obsession with getting everything Final Fight until they put out a Final Fight that sucked.
3700292	3703913	But I've got Final Fight CD and Mighty Final Fight, which was the SD version.
3704844	3705785	That came out on Nintendo.
3705805	3707186	But yeah, let me actually get back to the game.
3707527	3709609	Final Fight was an arcade game put out by Capcom.
3710569	3715874	And it was designed by Nishitani Akira, who you will see as Nin Nin.
3716795	3720739	And characters were designed by Yasuda Akira, which you'll see as Akiman.
3721520	3723442	So some of those names should definitely be familiar.
3724403	3725844	All this Capcom-tastic music.
3726682	3728144	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3742355	3743276	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3759504	3763165	He's super fast and was super awesome to play with, so never mind.
3764245	3766366	Cody was the balanced guy, Hagar was the strong guy.
3767167	3770928	He's also ranked third in EGM's list of top ten video game politicians.
3771868	3774229	So there were... Hello, Random.
3775690	3783233	So this game is actually way ahead of its time, because it actually had pre-op transgendered women in it.
3786092	3786692	Whatever.
3786952	3798276	Anyway, yeah, there are actually two women in the game called Poison and Roxy, but they turned them into men named Billy and Sid for the American version.
3799016	3801417	So they were... So you're not hitting women.
3802198	3802618	I guess.
3803238	3807159	Or hoochie women with really short skirts and, you know, where you can see under boobs.
3807859	3808160	I see.
3809760	3810680	Under boobs.
3810821	3811221	Under boobs.
3813766	3814406	You know what I mean.
3814486	3816167	I know what you're talking about.
3816368	3819109	I haven't heard it phrased quite so eloquently before.
3819329	3822931	There was also the Andore family that were all based off of Andre the Giant.
3824352	3825333	Yeah.
3825473	3832737	Also, a character named 2P that was based off of Player 2 character from Forgotten Worlds.
3832917	3833718	Did you ever play that game, Rob?
3835174	3836394	I have like the special controller.
3836414	3838495	It was one of Capcom's kind of interesting weird games.
3839355	3842496	But since he looked like the second player, he was called 2P.
3843436	3845136	So anyway.
3845396	3846637	And then you had your bosses.
3846797	3848817	You had Damned, who in the U.S.
3848877	3849577	was Thrasher.
3851498	3855918	You had Sodom, who was called Katana in the U.S.
3855938	3856218	version.
3856719	3860819	But he came out and he was one of the ones that was brought back for Street Fighter Alpha series.
3862480	3863600	In fact, that's the other video version.
3864051	3865632	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
3890626	3891647	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3917570	3928597	He's like the uber crazy violent otaku guy who's so obsessed with Japanese culture that he wears a samurai hat and football padding.
3929357	3930058	It's stupid.
3931397	3943405	But yeah, um, but they said that the, um, the, uh, basis for, uh, Final Fight is actually off Double Dragon 2, The Revenge and the Arcade.
3943525	3951070	So, uh, they, uh, brought it up and they, um, actually were saying that, uh, some of the characters were former Street Fighters.
3951390	3952191	So, it's kind of neat.
3952811	3954352	Um, so yeah, there was the whole issue with the ports.
3954392	3959336	And I'm actually gonna, um, take a link off of the, uh, uh,
3962599	3973049	You can actually see pictures up, and I'm going to link them in the chat room, of the changes to the characters, to the Poison character.
3974130	3979895	But now for other versions, there's Sega CD, the Sega CD version, which...
3981016	3983238	I have, I love Final Fight CD.
3983498	3987381	It's got an arranged soundtrack in a time attack mode.
3987461	3988361	It's super fun.
3989262	3992144	I've got Final Fight 1 somewhere for GBA.
3993525	4004873	There was, when it came out in the US, actually there was an Amiga Atari ST, Commodore 64 ZX Spectrum, well that was in Europe, and Armstead CPC version.
4006093	4009095	There was a Sharp X68000 version that came out.
4010376	4016539	There was the one I mentioned, Mighty Final Fight, which was the 8-bit version for NES that had the super deformed.
4016579	4018080	And it's actually super fun.
4018320	4019720	It is really fun and really cute.
4020621	4021221	Cheap and Final Fight.
4021661	4022642	Yeah.
4023442	4028205	Final, well, no, super deformed because they are like the really squished up looking bodies.
4028345	4028945	Yeah, I've seen it.
4029445	4029706	Yeah.
4030806	4052319	also Final Fight came out on the Capcom Classics Collection Volume 1 for PlayStation 2 and Xbox and a portable version Capcom Classics Collection Remix for PSP and it had the emulated CPS music so that was pretty cool there was also Final Fight Streetwise which I pretend not to exist because it sucks um
4056412	4058153	or maybe it was the Final Fight Double Imp.
4058853	4058993	Nope.
4059493	4061474	It was the new one that they tried to do.
4061494	4062474	Yeah, whatever.
4063934	4066735	Damn, I only knew the Final Fight that was at the local pizza place.
4067235	4068176	Well, there's also sequels.
4068216	4069816	There was Final Fight 2 and Final Fight 3.
4069856	4070396	I've got those.
4070416	4071276	They're actually fun.
4073137	4075738	Now, there's also...
4078977	4084805	An American Street Fighter animated series, and I know it sucks, but they actually had Cody and Guy teaming up with Ken and Ryu.
4085566	4086187	It was really weird.
4088810	4095720	They're also, of course, Mike Hagar's and Saturday Night Slam Masters, and Muscle Bomber Duo and Slam Masters 2, The Ring of Destruction.
4097341	4125454	Street Fighter games you had Guy in Sodom then Rolento and Cody in Street Fighter Alpha 3 and then you had in Street Fighter 3 Second Impact you had a character that was modeled after Andori and his manager is Poison I don't know if you ever played Street Fighter 3 just a couple times that was kind of during that phase where I was out of touch with gaming for a little bit but Cody and Guy are actually going to be in Super Street Fighter 4 yeah and I remember that was a story last week that kind of probably got you thinking about this I think that's pretty cool
4126846	4130907	Yeah, there was also another 3D fighting game version, Final Fight Revenge.
4132607	4136088	And then, you know, meh.
4136528	4154811	But also, it sort of seems that they used the same format, though, for a lot of the other games that came out afterwards, like King of Dragons and Knights of the Round, Captain Commando, Warriors of Fate, Cadillacs and Dinosaurs, The Punisher, D&D Tower of Doom, and then Alien vs. Predator, though, I think is one of the best games to come after that.
4157642	4159445	But yeah, a lot of that came through.
4159525	4161727	So yeah, Final Fight, win.
4162288	4162568	Alright.
4163029	4167074	There it is, your classic game of the week, Final Fight, available on lots and lots of systems.
4167194	4167935	I'll post those pictures.
4168115	4170138	The arcade was one of the most memorable.
4170936	4181560	All right, that's going to do it for Part A here of Orange Launch Radio, but don't go anywhere because we've got plenty more to come in Part B, including your Twitter topics, which I haven't put a call out for on Twitter yet, but we'll get those.
4182680	4184301	And I haven't seen any emails this week.
4184321	4186421	I don't even know if we'll have any of those, but we'll get to those.
4186742	4193464	But we do have some news, if nothing else, of talking about Redbox expanding to game rental, which I think has come up on the show before, but now it's going to the next step.
4194104	4195845	Somebody beat World of Warcraft.
4196345	4197406	Yes, somebody beat it.
4198006	4200828	More things to waste money on your Xbox Live avatars with.
4201048	4204690	And, of course, it wouldn't be lulzy if we didn't talk about an adult game.
4204730	4206391	So we'll be talking about that all in the next segment.
4206671	4207271	So stay tuned.
4207291	4209873	We'll be right back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
4216434	4242122	Hello everybody and welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio on this lovely Sunday evening, December the 6th of 2009, where we're eagerly anticipating snow tomorrow here in Sacramento, where Orange Lounge Radio is based, when we never, and this is a big deal, I realize some of you live in the East Coast and even in other countries where snow is probably no big deal, in fact you probably hate it, but we never see snow here, so even the fact that it's just going to even like sprinkle a little white tomorrow is going to be amazing, I'm excited.
4242822	4244102	Too bad it's not Christmas tomorrow.
4244122	4245023	That would make it even better.
4245283	4245983	But, oh well.
4246423	4247443	So we're all excited about that.
4248164	4252785	Anyhow, we've got plenty more news to get into tonight here on Orange Lounge Radio.
4252805	4265329	Of course, we always tape live every Sunday night at All Games Radio at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern Time, right at the close of the Bobby Blackwolf Show, which is on one hour before we start at 5 or 8, depending on where you live.
4265769	4271651	We're going to get into some rapid-fire news, and then we'll get into your Twitter topics in just a little bit.
4272091	4272691	Thanks for watching!
4289997	4290518	DarkSakura.com
4309955	4322330	of course it's an option to unlock the nudity so if you really don't want to see naked women then you don't have to and once again if you do pick up the game used you will be able to get the download content it's going to cost you $3 or 240 Microsoft points
4327016	4337262	Uh, let's see, Dante's Inferno, the God of War-esque type game, will be coming to the PlayStation Network and Xbox Live Marketplace in the form of a demo.
4337743	4340884	Soon, the PlayStation Network will get it a few weeks early.
4341045	4344327	In fact, you'll be able to pick it up next week on Thursday, December 10th.
4345087	4348409	The Xbox Live Marketplace will be getting it on December 24th.
4349550	4354553	And, um, the game itself is not scheduled to come out until, I believe, like, February, so...
4357431	4360113	Santa Claus is coming to PlayStation Home!
4383339	4385841	When I ask for a BB gun, will he tell me you'll shoot your eye out?
4386721	4387181	Perhaps.
4387522	4388322	You know what's funny?
4388462	4390804	Is my character still dressed like Santa from last year.
4392505	4392745	Nice.
4393405	4394706	And that's how it's going to stay.
4394806	4395767	Now you need to change it.
4395807	4400229	You need to change it to like a Halloween outfit or something now that it's Christmas.
4400650	4400810	Nope.
4401230	4402351	You can be like Jack Skellington.
4404158	4404878	Thanks for watching!
4425404	4426365	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4447899	4449020	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4475086	4479409	Well, I didn't think this game could be possibly ported anywhere else, but I was proven wrong.
4479469	4481870	Dragon's Lair is coming out for the iPhone.
4481890	4489676	That's right, the old school 1983 Laserdisc game, Dragon's Lair, that's been released on every single console.
4490476	4491957	Ever, it seems like anyway.
4492317	4495559	It is now coming to the iPhone, thanks to Electronic Arts, who is doing the port.
4496239	4497700	Not sure exactly how they're doing it.
4497740	4500201	It looks like you have little up, down, left, right arrows on the screen.
4500501	4501982	Right, except the corners of the screen.
4502002	4505744	Exactly, a big button on the other side for the sword button there.
4506424	4512027	It is coming out for five bucks, I think, because that's what Space Ace is priced at.
4512047	4515549	They don't have a final price yet, but Space Ace is five bucks.
4515569	4517530	They also had Cobra Command as well, which is...
4518070	4518651	Very similar.
4519252	4523436	I might need to get Dragon's Lair, except you know what I just found while I was cleaning off my desk?
4524738	4526079	Dragon's Lair?
4527921	4528962	Dragon's Lair HD.
4529183	4531906	Oh, the HD kind of different one they did a while ago.
4531966	4532426	Yeah, I remember that.
4532446	4534469	Hidden under a layer of stuff.
4534729	4535069	Wow.
4535710	4538053	I tell you, I sneeze and find games, Bob.
4539671	4541172	I still need to take a picture of Final Fight Guy, don't I?
4541812	4542172	Yes, you do.
4543253	4544754	Yeah, so, I don't know.
4545414	4548836	I will always be partial to the Dragon's Lair that was on the Commodore 64.
4548956	4550076	It was way different.
4550096	4551417	It was like a completely different game.
4552477	4555099	Harder than hell, but a lot of fun, I have to admit.
4555839	4557020	That's the one I'll always be partial to.
4557681	4559843	Anyhow, how about some news about Rock Band?
4559883	4563746	Of course, it wouldn't be a week here at OLR if we didn't have news about upcoming Rock Band releases.
4564146	4566088	More Green Day coming out for Rock Band.
4566368	4579860	Apparently, Christian's Inferno, Last of the American Girls, and Viva La Gloria, which I believe are all off the latest CD, 21st Century Breakdown, are on their way on December 15th or December 17th, depending on what system you're on.
4581687	4582868	Thank you for watching!
4601055	4603399	This is kind of awesome in a real dorky sort of way.
4603799	4606604	Simon and Garfunkel are getting some songs in Rock Band.
4607185	4613294	I am a rock and the sounds of silence because when you want to rock, I know the first thing you think of is Simon and Garfunkel.
4614036	4615258	DarkSakura, what do you got for us tonight?
4616774	4618075	Just a few things, actually.
4619796	4623437	And it isn't actually the page I was looking at about the land of make-believe.
4625118	4634423	Gearbox actually trademarked Border Worlds, so the rumor is that Borderlands could be extended into...
4635350	4636131	Thank you for watching!
4654349	4657652	And then the UK has a date for Metal Gear Solid Peace Walker.
4657752	4660274	It will be the 28th of May.
4661395	4666139	And, of course, that's going to be on PSP.
4667119	4673565	And actually, in Japan, it's going to be coming out on March 18th.
4674365	4675726	So, four-player co-op.
4676047	4676687	It can be Snake.
4677168	4677448	Woohoo!
4678320	4679321	Snakeu!
4679821	4686986	And then Squeenix put out a song, a song, a game, a song summoner for iPhone.
4687786	4692409	It's actually called Song Summoner the Unsung Heroes for iPhone and iPod Touch.
4693450	4698714	And that it's got touchscreen controls, of course, and characters in different scenarios.
4699034	4704558	And it's supposed to be out, there's a demo for it out actually.
4704758	4706759	And for UK customers it'll be £5.99.
4710061	4736743	I've heard that Song Summoner is kind of anth though because it was out on the old school iPod you know well in other words the iPods a lot of people still have really they came out on those a while ago and I think it was kind of under the radar because the iPhones and iTouches already come out and a lot of those releases got missed but I'd like to see what they've actually managed to do with it yeah you never know they might have like kind of changed some things and done some upgrades too so it would be kind of cool to see what is going on
4737703	4744208	What I'd like to see what's going on with right now is the Twitter topics, so let's open up ye olde Twitter and see what you guys have to say.
4744428	4747290	Very fast tonight with the Twitter topics, by the way, I'm quite impressed.
4748271	4752574	Seg starting us off tonight, of course, with another plug for Umlaut, because that's happening this week.
4753274	4755016	Seg wants to know, are y'all going to Umlaut?
4755776	4761060	I'm going, for sure, but I think the fact that it's on a weeknight is kind of screwing with everyone else, because it is a couple hours away.
4762821	4769244	I'm able to kind of swing it where I'm getting off work a little early so I can make it, but I might be the sole representation there.
4769664	4772205	Sorry, but I'm going to have three times the fun.
4772886	4773986	So, meh.
4774586	4777668	Hope to see some of you listeners there that are local to San Francisco.
4778568	4799817	Alex Carson says I'm going to make a PSP app for your show if that's okay with you guys actually we do have a PSP website olrpsp.com and you can download a PSP radio tuner there I forgot about that in the earlier part of the show because Loki hasn't updated it in a couple years so whereas you might have some broken graphics and things I think it still works right Loki I don't know have you checked that out in a while
4802020	4803361	I think it still sort of works.
4820865	4821165	DarkSakura.com
4844554	4845054	Let's see.
4845755	4852721	DarkTetsuya says, Arcade Heroes is picking the best arcade game of the past decade, 2000 to 2009.
4853462	4853862	Thoughts?
4854883	4861549	My thought is, I'm kind of sad because this was the decade that arcades kind of died and got replaced with Ticket Redemption Machines.
4861609	4863430	So I don't know if I have an easy answer.
4863470	4868875	Anyone have an answer for what the best arcade game of the past 10 years would be?
4870862	4898842	Strider 2 I mean obviously DDR was somewhat impactful for us I would say also maybe like what was it oh gosh oh I know Final Furlong Horsey Riding Game Horsey Humping Derby Owners Club I would say Derby Owners Club just because it's so fucking epic like when you see it it's the size of an arcade amazing
4900976	4902517	Sky, I love you, let's repeal Prop 8 and get married
4924315	4927377	But I think you might need to take me to dinner first before I agree to get married, just saying.
4929038	4932120	Alex Carson wants to know, how many of you are phone freakers?
4933500	4934001	What is that?
4934701	4936082	It's like hacking your phone, right?
4936102	4936882	Yeah, I'm not.
4937223	4945668	Back in the day, people used to modify those Captain Crunch whistles to be able to dial the phones when back then it was the rotary pulse dials.
4946228	4948409	Is that this kind of stuff we're talking about?
4948569	4949610	Old school hacking stuff?
4950371	4952592	I find that stuff interesting, but I don't do it myself.
4954517	4956478	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4983654	5006702	um let's see let's see it was Javier Altman on Twitter says OLR pick your topic the platypus is made out of other animal spare parts or the saboteur boobies DLC with love footy well we already talked about the saboteur boobies DLC so uh the platypus is made out of other animal spare parts uh isn't that like a hot dog actually you're talking about I think that the platypus is god going see
5009829	5019057	Blue Swim says, what do you think of the Best Buy giving DSi buyers a free copy of Tony Hawk's Motion, a game which requires a GBA port to play?
5020318	5023540	This is where if I had the Price is Right Losing Horn queued up, I'd play it right now.
5024141	5026503	That's kind of humorous, actually, in a sick way.
5026523	5027243	That's hilarious.
5027303	5028244	That's a Best Buy movie.
5028304	5032968	I didn't hear about that at all, actually, so thank you for bringing that to my attention because it's pretty lulzy.
5034895	5039619	Master of the Claw sent us a YouTube link to some people having fun jamming.
5040260	5041361	Look at that, they're getting down.
5043423	5045304	Oh my god, they're dancing to Bird is the Word.
5045324	5047466	It reminds me of that Family Guy episode.
5048127	5050409	They're playing a game called Just Dance on the Wii.
5050809	5051490	Bird is the Word.
5054107	5054787	Did you hear?
5055588	5057549	Bird is the word.
5058209	5061611	The fact that that's in that game, that makes the game 100% good.
5061691	5071016	Actually, yeah, I heard of this game and it looked ridiculous, but now that I know that it's tongue-in-cheek ridiculous, I'm far more interested, so thank you for bringing it to my attention.
5072357	5073637	That guy is just getting down.
5074378	5074938	And that chick.
5076739	5079360	I don't think that chick would be getting down like this, though, if you weren't paying her to do it.
5079380	5080481	She looks a little bit...
5082017	5082658	LilBinimo.
5082838	5083598	That's awesome.
5084099	5085800	That game does kind of look like fun, actually.
5086641	5086981	Thank you.
5087021	5088102	Just Dance on the Wii.
5088323	5089564	I'm assuming that's out now?
5089984	5090304	I don't know.
5090344	5091145	Yes, that's out now.
5091725	5092326	I don't know, Loki.
5092486	5093367	Been out for a few weeks.
5093427	5095469	Loki, we might have to play that and YouTube it.
5095489	5096450	No, we don't.
5097270	5097931	No, we don't.
5099175	5100836	But Loki, didn't you hear?
5101416	5102737	Bird is the word
5128754	5132499	That could be the game of the year right there if we didn't have President Cat this year.
5132559	5135164	Speaking of President Cat, I gotta get this out here real quick.
5135704	5136385	Did you know...
5137708	5141191	There's still no word about President Cat getting a release over here in the US.
5141351	5142151	Just so you know.
5142352	5143473	There's still no word on that.
5143773	5149777	But, do you know what game is coming out on WiiWare in a couple months?
5149857	5150478	Muscle March.
5150578	5151979	Muscle March is coming out.
5152019	5153460	Do you know what Muscle March is?
5153861	5157864	If you don't know what Muscle March is, you need to YouTube this game immediately.
5158464	5165129	Because it's like... It's awesome, but it's like, imagine Cho Aniki meets...
5166010	5174255	That game meets that game show where you have to twist your body to not fall through the wall or whatever meets crack.
5174576	5176317	Pure adulterated crack.
5179879	5182741	I can't believe that game is coming out and yet no word on President Cat.
5182781	5183281	I'm just saying.
5183341	5186243	And all this bullshit about President Cat only sold 100 copies.
5186623	5187464	Source, please.
5190438	5193120	I mean, I know probably like a hundred people over here that imported it.
5193160	5196121	Apparently it got a shout-out on the 1UP show this week.
5196141	5196902	I don't listen to that show.
5196922	5200904	Yeah, they discovered the game, and so therefore they're informing the internet of the game.
5200944	5202405	Gee, I can't.
5202485	5204666	And they're the first ones that ever discovered the game.
5204686	5205207	Clearly, yes.
5205267	5206367	How about they're full of shit?
5206467	5207008	Everybody...
5207888	5208848	Send letters.
5208968	5210989	Well, to be fair, they didn't call it President Cat.
5211229	5213910	If they had called it President Cat, I would say something.
5213950	5214990	But we refer to it by name.
5215310	5216351	Yeah, I know.
5216851	5217571	It doesn't matter.
5218131	5219272	It matters to me.
5219612	5221272	How dare they steal our thunder?
5221392	5222292	I don't care.
5222593	5222853	I care.
5222873	5224793	I'm all about spreading the word about the game.
5224833	5227874	And if it gets it out there, then whatever.
5228674	5230075	That's why we don't get recognized, Rob.
5231131	5231952	We need to pimp ourselves.
5232293	5232793	You can't prove it.
5233474	5234135	I've got the internet.
5234415	5235437	I have the data post.
5236518	5238660	It was also on Joystick.
5238721	5243026	You've got Joystick and Destructoid backing us up, so nah.
5244227	5245348	I just don't care enough.
5245409	5245809	I'm sorry.
5245829	5246450	I don't care enough.
5248089	5251291	I don't want to become the president cat show, okay?
5251451	5252291	It had its moment.
5252491	5253331	I'm over it.
5253351	5255993	I listened to a little bit of the podcast.
5256013	5258954	They're like, yeah, we heard it sold like 80 copies.
5258994	5263016	Because there's 81!
5264677	5266437	They're firing on all cylinders over there.
5269859	5270359	Let's see.
5273061	5273541	Where was I?
5274604	5280150	Matt Ostrovsky tweeted us, by the way, one more tweet here that the OLR listeners will want to know.
5280651	5285676	OLR Evolution second mix will be coming out December 24th for everyone.
5286017	5291202	Oh, that's cool, like a little Christmas present, or Hanukkah present, if you will, whatever it is you're into, or Kwanzaa, I don't care.
5291443	5296188	Whatever you celebrate, Solstice, or, you know, what do Pastafarians celebrate on Christmas, I guess?
5297028	5299130	They celebrate Nokimasu.
5299430	5300431	I guess that's what it is.
5300471	5301031	A pirate day.
5302753	5306335	Anyhow, whatever it is you celebrate this winter, OLR Evolution's second mix is coming out.
5307096	5309618	If you don't know what that is, it's like a DDR clone type thing.
5310419	5315443	They take one of those DDR sims and they completely reskin it with OLR related songs.
5315863	5320106	I think they even take clips of our voice and now we're like the announcers in the game.
5320547	5321748	It's a lot of great fan work.
5322048	5324610	I definitely need to check this
5324730	5330062	I take it as a big compliment it's amazing so thank you very much fans for putting that together you guys rock
5330267	5332008	That Just Dance game looks interesting.
5332148	5333629	Doesn't Just Dance kind of look like fun?
5334409	5335650	It's only because that song's in there.
5335670	5337391	If there's any other song, I wouldn't give it to you.
5337411	5345736	I will admit, to the tweeter who asked why the hell we hadn't talked about it before, when I saw the box art and the songs they were advertising, I was like, this is going to be Weech here or something.
5346376	5350819	I did dismiss it very quickly, but it looks like it could be ridiculous fun.
5350939	5358423	If it was called Just Dance featuring the bird, surfing bird, you know, 100,000 more copies sold right there.
5360762	5361364	Gaming News and Loki.
5361384	5361484	Yes.
5361505	5361545	Um...
5367741	5381664	Redbox, the DVD kiosk rental place that's been popularized by all its locations and Walmarts and various supermarkets and everywhere else in between.
5382504	5383805	They are now test marketing.
5383885	5392026	Well, they have been test marketing game rentals in Reno, Nevada and Wilmington, North Carolina.
5392766	5394067	They're testing them out at $2 a piece.
5396411	5397814	Yeah, I've been well aware of this.
5398135	5399759	It's something we deal with, actually.
5402826	5406033	And hopefully it's something that will launch full scale at some point.
5406530	5411073	They're also testing some higher price points too for DVD rentals, but that's another story.
5411673	5416576	That's a whole thing because I hear the movie studios are pissed that they're only charging a dollar for DVD rentals.
5416596	5419998	Yeah, but that's... Because it devalues the movie.
5420699	5423800	As if ending up in the $5 bin at Walmart isn't devaluing your movie.
5423840	5424561	I mean, please get over yourself.
5424601	5427903	I could talk for a long time about how retarded that
5428383	5428963	Thanks for watching!
5447990	5448671	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5469162	5470382	and that's unfortunately the case.
5470723	5473263	This actually, I believe, is unrelated to all that.
5473383	5486748	The reason why I think they're raising their rentals to $2 is because they're starting to carry more Blu-rays in there and you can't rent a Blu-ray for a buck a day and expect to make a return on your investment.
5487388	5490209	Yeah, that's true too, is that they're going to lose money at that rate.
5490409	5492989	But still, I think it's kind of cool though, $2 rentals for games.
5493029	5493770	I mean, that's not bad.
5494070	5494670	That's not bad at all.
5495329	5500616	I don't either, but I should.
5501016	5503759	I would save a lot of money if I were smart enough to rent the games.
5504120	5508485	My only issue is that the nearest Redbox machine I can think of is at Walmart, and I ain't setting foot in that place.
5509642	5510283	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5534229	5538196	Which is funny, Safeway is next door to Walmart, yet Safeway doesn't have that problem.
5539339	5540641	Because Safeway hires security guards.
5541984	5545591	Safeway probably also doesn't want people loitering out front selling shit too, so.
5547234	5548934	I had people knock at my door today.
5549034	5550955	Two different people trying to sell me shit.
5551415	5552255	I hate that shit.
5553235	5556476	Someone trying to sell me the SAC-B so they can get their $1,000 scholarship.
5556696	5560197	Do you know how many of those kids have come to my door in the past couple weeks?
5560217	5564518	Because when I was home sick with the swine flu, I swear to God, three of those people came by the house.
5565338	5569619	I'm like, I'm going to cough on you, and then you're really going to have something to fundraise for.
5570139	5571519	Do you have any cans?
5572040	5573040	No, I don't have any cans.
5573080	5573520	Go away.
5574858	5577799	People dig through the recycle bin at my house.
5578659	5580700	I gotta watch what I throw in there.
5582520	5583141	It's kind of freaky.
5583641	5584121	People suck.
5584781	5589363	Anyhow, ToyGak in our chat says threaten to shoot them if they don't get off your property.
5589403	5590323	Sadly, it's not that easy.
5591581	5595884	DarkTattooia is pointing me to the peopleofwalmart.com website, which, by the way, love.
5596725	5597565	Love that site.
5597665	5597886	Hilarity.
5597906	5598786	Great time waster.
5599026	5599927	Yes, great time waster.
5600387	5602689	Hitstone wants to know, is Walmart that bad in California?
5602969	5603630	Depends where you are.
5604290	5605411	There's some really nice ones.
5605451	5607112	There's some really nice Walmarts I will go to.
5607132	5607913	I like to... Well...
5608573	5612618	Walmart for me also, when I first moved out here, I could not find a Walmart.
5613059	5615282	We had to go to like Alberta to find a Walmart.
5615302	5617324	Yeah, they're only new as of the past 10 years.
5617424	5618786	Well, now we have the super centers now.
5619126	5621069	Yeah, and honestly, that makes the difference to me.
5621089	5622831	If it's a super center, it's usually really nice.
5622871	5623372	If it's not...
5623892	5651685	for the longest time we couldn't have them out here because of actually zoning laws regarding grocery stores where you can have a certain number of grocery stores within a certain radius of each other but I think they since lifted that because I saw them building the one on Antelope way back here near where I live when I would come home from work and now it's here and I love it actually it's kind of funny I just stayed in there for two hours when they first opened it because I was so homesick when I get homesick I go to Walmart
5652381	5660644	Honestly, though, why would I ever go to Walmart when there's a Target just a couple blocks away that's brand spanking new and nice and even has groceries now?
5661164	5663745	It's Uber Target, and I love it.
5664286	5666987	Actually, Walmart does have better prices for certain things.
5667267	5671028	Okay, I know you're not a chick, but... Tampons?
5671648	5675390	No, actually, the hair dye that I buy, I actually get cheaper.
5675850	5680532	A lot of the stuff that I get, actually, I tend to get a whole lot cheaper than action figures.
5680832	5681012	Mm-hmm.
5684192	5693638	Where else can I go to get a bag of baby spinach and then run over and buy some Equate brand NyQuil stuff?
5695459	5697460	HitStun is mentioning Costco.
5697480	5698781	Actually, it was Marissa that first said it.
5698861	5700582	Screw Sam's Club, Costco for the win.
5701182	5704124	Costco's pretty awesome if you need like 15 of something.
5706206	5706747	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
5715342	5715682	You know what?
5715702	5716503	It would be a smart arrangement.
5716523	5717064	You know what we do?
5717524	5728314	Well, we actually did just get a Costco membership, but we had a friend, actually our landlord, but he's a buddy of ours, has a Costco membership, and then Dan is our friend Julie's complimentary spouse.
5729595	5729855	Nice.
5730856	5733319	I actually got pissed off over that the first time, though.
5733659	5734139	Yeah, yeah.
5734340	5736261	But I think we have our own membership now, but still.
5736822	5738043	I like Costco quite a bit, actually.
5738063	5738363	Yeah.
5739504	5744329	All joking aside about the bulk items, they do have really good deals on TVs and the high-end stuff.
5744929	5746211	I got my TV at Costco.
5747111	5748553	I told you about what happened with ours, right?
5749674	5754618	Keep in mind, with Costco, you can return anything, anytime, without your receipt.
5755039	5756020	You can just go.
5756260	5758302	It'll be on your membership card.
5758382	5764948	We had our old 50-inch widescreen TV, and we actually took it back to exchange it for
5765720	5767464	You know, something that was equivalent.
5767844	5770550	And we actually now have a 52 inch LCD widescreen.
5772165	5774366	Because we could exchange it for anything equivalent.
5775086	5776227	And it was the only equivalent they had.
5776267	5777667	Our old model is not made anymore.
5777747	5781108	They do have a great return policy at Costco.
5781929	5784009	I did have a TV break and I took it back and they took it back.
5784650	5784970	Amazing.
5785470	5787771	Anyhow, I don't know how we got from Redbox to Costco, but we did.
5787811	5788271	So there you go.
5788951	5789912	World of Warcraft.
5789992	5792473	Moving on to this crack of a game.
5792513	5793273	World of Warcraft.
5793293	5794033	World of Warcrack.
5794773	5795274	I'm addicted.
5795374	5795914	What can I say?
5796114	5796514	It's fun.
5796834	5798615	But did you hear that it got beaten?
5798855	5800976	Yes, somebody beat the World of Warcraft.
5801738	5803099	And of course, they live in Taiwan.
5804240	5806942	And the character's name is Little Grey, if you translate the name.
5807342	5808763	They've beat the World of Warcraft.
5809263	5810364	What do I mean by beat?
5810804	5814627	No, I don't mean they beat the final raid in the game, because then a lot of people have beat it, if that's the case.
5814987	5820331	No, they have gotten every single achievement in World of Warcraft.
5820511	5820631	All 986.
5820671	5821431	Someone has no fucking life.
5824548	5825389	Here's my thought.
5825509	5827311	I bet multiple people are splitting this account.
5827411	5829073	I bet multiple people contributed to this.
5829133	5830534	It probably wasn't just one person.
5830935	5834598	It's still an impressive achievement, though, but at the same time, time to go outside!
5835683	5838105	There are some achievements in there that are crazy.
5838245	5846632	One of them is that you have to get exalted with Aldor and then you have to go all the way down to Hated and get exalted with Scryer.
5847292	5848954	That means nothing to people that don't play WoW.
5849214	5851296	It means nothing to me.
5851336	5852437	It's a lot of fucking grinding.
5852477	5853337	Let's just leave it like that.
5853397	5855999	It's like trying to gain one level in Final Fantasy XI.
5856079	5857320	It's a lot of fucking grinding.
5858061	5859422	That's a great analogy.
5860643	5862264	That's a fantastic analogy.
5862425	5863926	Yes, and it's accurate too.
5864725	5870108	Because, I mean, like, for me, I'm like, I can't stand to play with, like, more than two people at a time.
5870748	5873289	Because I'm like, you're going too fast!
5874010	5877051	So, just doing all of that would be, like, wince.
5879392	5886295	I will say though, despite all the crap I give Final Fantasy XI years out, I am super, super excited for Final Fantasy XIV.
5886675	5892497	I'm already seeing that 2010 will be the year I finally quit WoW because we'll have Final Fantasy XIV and we'll have Star Trek Online.
5892778	5895499	Star Trek Online is going to completely murder any free time I have.
5896099	5897380	I know, that's what I'm looking at too.
5897600	5899140	I'm going to command a fucking ship.
5899160	5900761	Did you see what they did to the Borg?
5902156	5909320	I've been very good about not looking at any previews for it because I want to poop my pants from shock and awe the first day I played it.
5909340	5913662	I'm still going to poop my pants, but I think that I farted a little bit.
5917243	5918484	To use your analogy, Rob.
5922626	5924026	Don't pin that analogy on me.
5924066	5924787	That's all you.
5925227	5926948	No, you're the one who said you were going to poop your pants.
5927728	5929309	I just want to use your same analogy.
5929369	5929869	All right, fine.
5931990	5932751	They did cool stuff.
5932771	5934352	So the Borg made you shard a little bit.
5938396	5944941	Anyway, some of the stuff that they were talking about is they were trying to make it to where you could not go back from assimilation.
5945321	5946482	They replaced your stomach.
5948164	5948484	Wow.
5948804	5951446	Because you don't really need to eat when you have a regeneration cycle.
5951947	5956310	I'm like, wow, these people are geeky on a level that is far beyond my comprehension.
5956711	5958292	So the Borg won't sh... Never mind.
5958692	5959413	They can't shit!
5960570	5963472	Unless they're going to throw up some energy at you or something.
5964093	5965334	They're going to fart sparks.
5968756	5970558	Resistance is futile, poot!
5975822	5979485	This was the moment when OLR got flushed down the toilet.
5979525	5984468	That's the moment where the episode literally and figuratively went down the...
5989960	5998968	Rest in Peace Orange Launch Radio 2002-2009 Alright Let's move on with some more gaming news Jamie, can you take us in a non-poopy direction please?
6001710	6008195	Sorry, I'm still laughing my ass off I'm laughing my ass off Are you laughing at what Salacious Pop is saying in chat?
6008555	6019044	I'm not looking They poop Sound Blaster cards from 1998 and laugh at you when they crash your Win 95 I lulled That's pretty damn funny
6020225	6023027	Oh, anyway, okay, so, how about some Tatsunoko vs. Capcom news?
6023147	6023607	Yes, please.
6023647	6026289	Cause Tatsunoko vs. Capcom is sexy.
6027009	6029371	Um, so yeah, actually, um...
6030629	6051319	There is something on one of the Mad Catz employees' flicker that is a Tatsunoko vs. Capcom fighting stick so that you can actually play fighting games without having to contort your fingers to actually use the damn Wii controller, even the classic controller.
6051339	6053000	I was going to say, the classic controller's not terrible.
6053500	6054221	But it's not great.
6055241	6058323	It's like trying to play fighting games on the SNES.
6058908	6059489	SuperStreetFighter2
6078274	6090381	Well, anyway, the theory is that it could be possible that it's going to be a bundle, like a normal and then arcade bundle, like Street Fighter 4 had.
6091502	6093223	And it looks really nice.
6093443	6093984	I hope so.
6094664	6106151	I mean, because honestly, you know what's funny is that playing fighting games at home, I actually do prefer to play on a good controller over playing it on a joystick, just because of some of my hand problems.
6107652	6107812	But
6108668	6110290	I would seriously get this.
6112031	6112691	It's sexy.
6113412	6117275	Everybody else's face is covered, except for that crack Ho-Chun Lee.
6117867	6118568	Kogaki Ninja Tai Gatchaman
6146565	6151446	Battle of the Planets Battle of the Planets Battle of the Planets Battle of the Planets Battle of the Planets
6172791	6173331	I'll give you that.
6173692	6180675	I mean, this definitely is catered to the anime convention going crowd, but there's a damn lot of anime convention going people, you know what I mean?
6181115	6183337	There's enough people that would take interest in a game like this.
6183357	6184457	Do you see this evil book?
6185738	6186158	Amano.
6186298	6187919	I have the giant book of Amano.
6187979	6191961	He did character designs for Gatchaman and a lot of the early Tatsunoko characters.
6192822	6194182	So, I'll find it and put a picture up.
6194843	6195143	Alright.
6197244	6197684	Sounds good.
6197704	6198785	Oh, here we go.
6198805	6199305	Open right to it.
6199778	6202661	What are you showing me?
6202801	6204002	Oh, some of the characters, I see.
6204743	6205504	Okay, very cool.
6206505	6207766	This makes for great radio, by the way.
6207846	6208347	Can I just point out?
6209888	6210269	Very cool.
6210309	6212411	Take a picture.
6212451	6214573	Meanwhile, Loki, let's move on with some more gaming news.
6214895	6220040	Yes, there's a new Xbox Live Arcade game coming out March 2010.
6220120	6224865	It's called Scourge Project, and it's a third-person shooter game.
6225826	6230051	It will be coming out on Steam, Xbox Live Arcade, and the PlayStation Network.
6230111	6232493	What's kind of notable about it is it actually looks really good.
6233554	6235857	It's being powered by the Unreal 3 engine.
6236397	6237939	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6255422	6258243	and I don't know, it looks pretty awesome.
6258443	6262045	Really high quality for even like an Xbox Live Arcade game.
6262165	6268047	You know, kind of almost something that I would expect from a console, just a standard disc release.
6268747	6271568	But something to definitely look forward to.
6271688	6278911	It was actually announced back in 2007, but I guess it took them this long to actually get it finished, but eh, whatever.
6279251	6280972	And like I said, it's scheduled to arrive March 2010.
6281012	6283733	So it's going to be pretty awesome.
6284915	6287077	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
6301733	6302874	and DarkSakura.com.
6322813	6323213	That's right.
6323254	6328219	If you've always wanted a pony, you can now have one for the low, low cost of 240 Microsoft points.
6328640	6329521	In the real world, that's $3.
6331323	6332524	$3 for a virtual pet.
6333365	6333965	That's your thing?
6334526	6335027	Have fun.
6335547	6336989	What can I do with this virtual pet?
6338571	6338671	Um...
6340327	6341728	or is it just going to be like a handbag?
6341868	6343190	Like, you know, I have the dog.
6343270	6348294	Well, you can see a little picture of the avatar with the dog and I guess they pet it.
6349695	6350716	Can I have multiple animals?
6350736	6354219	The dog probably barks, but not really because I don't think the avatar makes sound.
6354239	6355340	They should allow you to have multiple animals.
6355400	6359283	Like, I want to be a virtual catwoman in the game and have like 800 cats.
6359303	6361345	Did you just say you want to be a virtual catwoman?
6361745	6362506	Did I hear that correctly?
6362526	6365769	Cat lady, not catwoman as in, like, you know...
6366349	6367350	Thanks for watching!
6382242	6382883	Oh, I want to see.
6383183	6383403	I see.
6383423	6385525	You don't want to be like Michelle Pfeiffer or Holly Berry Catwoman.
6385545	6385885	No, no, no.
6385925	6386165	God.
6386226	6389929	You want to be the lady that lives in the shoe that has 500 cats.
6390249	6390409	Yes.
6390469	6391070	That you hear about.
6391090	6391991	Lives in the shoe?
6392131	6392851	You hear about.
6392871	6394933	She has so many cats she didn't know what to do.
6394953	6402540	I maybe combined a couple things there, but she's the lady you see on the news that, you know, she died in the house and all the cats like, you know, ate her.
6402580	6403100	Ate her.
6403540	6408865	And then, you know, suddenly the SPCA doesn't know what to do with all these cats, so they're trying to find homes for 500 cats.
6410745	6426331	500 human eating cats exactly I can find a home for them our prison system but they're adorable by the way, I just want to point out people are actually going to spend money on this
6427386	6427806	That's right.
6428086	6431989	People will spend $3 so that they can have a cutesy little pet.
6432009	6433189	Here's my problem.
6433830	6434470	I want to make a point.
6434510	6435270	This is very important.
6435731	6436991	This just proves my point.
6437311	6438812	And I've said this before on the show.
6439192	6445536	This will make money because America loves cats.
6446837	6448799	But the cat they have is a Siamese cat.
6448899	6450360	That's unacceptable.
6450400	6451200	There's other cats, too.
6451241	6452321	No, there's just a Siamese cat.
6452341	6453562	There's the long-haired cat.
6454063	6455604	Oh, well, I don't have a long-haired cat.
6455684	6457265	I want a cat that looks like my cat.
6457486	6459527	I have Shermie that sheds enough for 50 cats.
6461269	6465772	By the way, the Final Fight guy pictures are up at the Orange Zones Radio Gallery.
6466933	6471757	I want a guy cat that wears an orange jumpsuit and karate kicks intruders.
6471817	6472558	That's what I want.
6473939	6474799	That I might pay $3 for.
6477867	6482155	whatever, it's your money spend it on whatever makes you happy that's what I say
6483732	6484272	Thanks for watching!
6509360	6536728	funny how that works that sometimes we get like 100 twitters like we got tonight and then no emails and some nights we'll have like 50 emails and no twitters or something else alright so we'll roll over and don't email us now it's going to do no good you missed your chance so we'll roll them over to next week so there you go but there's always time for ranting and usually right after the mailbag we take a moment to rant about something and this week's no different we have the FUs of the week
6552725	6557770	We have a story tonight to inspire the FUs, just to get your ranting warmed up a little bit.
6558190	6573585	And that is that a Florida father apparently was arrested and thrown in the slammer for getting high, gaming all night long, and then falling asleep on his seven-month-old daughter.
6574286	6576347	which suffocated the poor thing to death.
6576827	6589630	His name, EmanuelLawrence30, and he finished a marathon game session at 6am, and he laid her on the bed next to him, rolled over, and dot dot dot, I don't need to describe what else happened.
6590030	6591771	This makes me angry for two reasons.
6592131	6595592	One, I think it's pretty obvious, he was an idiot.
6596172	6596452	Two...
6597631	6608038	I'm seeing this on game blogs, and with all due respect to the lovely people that work very hard on game blogs, this story has nothing to do with gaming, and it shouldn't... This guy's an idiot.
6608098	6608979	That's the problem.
6609099	6615384	I mean, the fact that he was gaming all night long, he could have just been easily watching movies or doing something else.
6615404	6616504	It has nothing to do with games.
6616665	6623129	So don't run it on the game blogs, because it just supports that notion that somehow it was connected to the games, when we all know it wasn't.
6623429	6625471	He was just a stupid, stupid head.
6626511	6627431	Stupid, stupid head.
6627672	6630853	And for that, he can go live with the 500 human-eating cats for all I care.
6631213	6634034	DarkSakura, your FU of the week, please.
6634875	6637356	FU to the wimpy California people.
6638497	6640117	It's just a little snow.
6640798	6642498	If you really don't... I'm excited.
6644019	6645020	I'm not really excited either.
6645040	6646720	I actually feel really indifferent about the whole thing.
6647361	6650222	I'm just like... Well, I suppose it's novel.
6651182	6654384	But at the same time, I'm like, dude, if you're afraid of people on the road, don't go out.
6654404	6654484	Dude.
6655723	6657987	If you have to go to work, drive safely.
6658928	6660551	I'm going to call in Snow to work tomorrow.
6660992	6662875	Well, they also sent us that warning.
6663255	6667823	And by the way, thank you for sending me the warning while I'm in the middle of doing really good stitches.
6668263	6669505	And also, fuck this hat.
6672230	6674092	My husband just arrived.
6676053	6678315	F you to people trying to sell me shit at my house.
6678435	6682398	I hate hearing the doorbell ring and going to the door and not recognizing the person.
6682979	6686602	I always assume that maybe it's a kid that threw a ball into our backyard or something like that.
6687748	6694414	Dumb me answers the door and it's always someone trying to sell shit or someone that wants cans for me to donate to them for shit.
6694654	6697357	I don't have your fucking- Are you sure you don't want a subscription to the SACB?
6697377	6698358	No, I don't want a subscription.
6698378	6700900	Because if you don't subscribe, I'm gonna die.
6701340	6702642	I'm not gonna be able to go on my trip.
6702682	6704864	I'm not gonna get my $1000 scholarship!
6704904	6706785	I'm gonna be stupid!
6707961	6708762	I don't give a fuck.
6708782	6716629	You're an idiot already if you think that you're going to get a $1,000 scholarship from the SACB for walking door-to-door to sell their fucking subscriptions.
6717089	6718030	You're an idiot.
6718450	6725516	Maybe you should have been smarter in the first place and you wouldn't have to walk door-to-door selling subscriptions to newspapers.
6725977	6732863	Instead, you'd be earning a scholarship from, I don't know, someone that celebrates academic excellence.
6734161	6734701	You're an idiot.
6735201	6737362	And I don't want your fucking SACB subscriptions.
6738082	6739343	I don't care how you give them to me.
6739503	6743625	Get the fuck out!
6744065	6747166	I'm in a pretty good mood today, so I don't really have a lot of FUs.
6747526	6748907	I guess FU to traffic.
6749347	6753168	Like, people driving to San Francisco don't know what they're doing and need to stop.
6753268	6754008	Get off my bridge.
6755469	6757970	FU to the S-curve on the bridge, too, for slowing everything down.
6758030	6760291	Well, you know a lot of people, a lot of trucks have been running off of it.
6761018	6761699	Did you hear about that?
6761859	6762659	Did you hear about that?
6791561	6795284	There should be grinders and explosions at the bottom of the hill.
6795404	6797305	And most importantly, human-eating cats.
6797605	6798486	Human-eating cats.
6798526	6799207	Living in the bay.
6799527	6801868	That's what they did at Alcatraz, actually.
6801969	6803590	That's how people didn't escape Alcatraz.
6803830	6805311	They had human-eating cats in the water.
6805331	6805851	Cat sharks.
6805891	6806612	That's right, cat sharks.
6806632	6807152	True story.
6807332	6807773	Look it up.
6807873	6809134	That's right, it's on Wikipedia.
6810495	6811716	Quick, put it on Wikipedia.
6812856	6817740	Couple more stories for you guys, and then we're going to get to your stories on our Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR.
6817780	6819081	But first, some Skype stories.
6820905	6821405	Skype stories?
6821425	6821806	What the hell?
6822066	6824968	The Skype line, then some last stories before we get to the Skype line.
6825348	6826529	I'm dyslexic today.
6826549	6827269	It's crazy.
6827689	6832232	I'm putting up the last of the Amano pictures right now.
6833453	6834154	So they should be up.
6834334	6834574	Run.
6834674	6835074	Go look.
6835274	6835535	Quick.
6836755	6842179	Well, if you're in Japan, there's definitely your share of adult games available out there.
6842899	6843040	And...
6844850	6845811	DarkSakura.com
6859929	6869451	Well, this game you can also get with a collector's edition that's bundled with a special manga, an audio CD, and a personal assistant.
6870172	6874213	No, that's not a person that takes down notation for you and brings you coffee.
6874793	6876273	It is a pocket pussy.
6877453	6879734	It is a rubber thing that you put your penis in.
6880234	6881374	A fleshlight, basically?
6882094	6882975	Without the fleshlight.
6883035	6884555	No, they're called ona cups.
6885435	6886836	As in, woman cup.
6887936	6888176	Wow.
6888766	6890788	Just go to J-List and look at all this stuff.
6890848	6892630	I really don't need to.
6893311	6894893	I have commercials for them.
6894913	6895333	It's hilarious.
6895353	6897536	My life will be fine without it, actually.
6897556	6899017	I think it's funny looking at the commercials.
6899157	6900899	And it will be released in Christmas.
6901720	6902781	Or during Christmas.
6903202	6904984	Oh, just in time for the holidays.
6905324	6906445	Just what I always wanted.
6906485	6908187	A pocket pussy to take with me.
6909068	6917530	I did love, though, you gotta share the artwork for the game with our chatters, because I love the unnaturally large breasts that the women had.
6917630	6920271	They were larger than Springer Large, okay?
6920291	6924172	Like Jerry Springer's show, when he has the women with the unnaturally large titties.
6924312	6925572	That's gonna cause some back pain.
6925592	6926372	That's a Z-cup.
6926412	6927513	Yeah, that's some back pain.
6927873	6929953	I can't believe she doesn't walk over with a hunch.
6930193	6931954	I mean, that is just amazing.
6935014	6936875	That is some serious...
6938368	6942730	Seriously large boobies there.
6942750	6946271	I kind of laugh at some of the stuff that I've seen.
6946511	6954054	They've got the booby pillows or the booby mouse pads and stuff like that.
6955675	6956675	That's just a little much.
6959336	6960896	Sorry, I'm laughing at a comment in chat.
6961377	6967279	Salacious Pop comments, I'd carry a pocket pussy with me, but only to give friends sudden nose kisses.
6969505	6972508	Oh my god, if someone did that to me, I think I'd slap them.
6973630	6975752	Although the mental image is really funny.
6975792	6977093	Can you imagine walking up to someone?
6977454	6977994	I kiss you!
6979256	6981698	Wow, their website is sure detailed.
6982099	6982339	What?
6983260	6988446	And I guess they have different ones depending on which woman that you want to... Oh well, whoopee!
6989997	6992418	Like different depths and widths and everything?
6992678	6993739	Are they all loose?
6993839	6994639	They're all different.
6994679	6996019	The women in this game, clearly.
6996059	6997580	They've got different patterns in there.
6997620	7005083	See, you've got the one chick there, the blue, and it looks like nubs and ribs and something else.
7005363	7010765	That looks like a diagram that you see in a geology book about what it would look like if you drilled to the center of the Earth.
7011205	7012886	That's what that looks like to me.
7013666	7015907	Oh, well, you're drilling to the center of the Earth, all right.
7016207	7017088	Shut up, you ass.
7018007	7021390	And then that one right there looks like a spine and a screw at the top there.
7021450	7021630	It does.
7021690	7022932	It looks like an MRI picture.
7023032	7029497	And that one's got kind of like some sort of DNA helix thing going on there.
7029658	7030038	Wait a minute.
7030538	7032260	Is this radio really happening right now?
7032280	7034622	We're describing pocket pussies on our radio program?
7034642	7035963	That's not going to help our chat room.
7036003	7037044	I've got to link this into the chat room.
7037084	7037845	Yes, you do.
7038445	7038926	The commercials.
7039146	7040287	The commercials are hilarious.
7042549	7043130	No, thank you.
7045453	7047294	You know, Rob, they do make vibrators.
7050156	7051017	Oh, it was funny.
7051057	7056781	The other day we were watching and this is the perfect use of our PS3.
7057801	7061144	Oh, and of course, the one that looks like they're underage, of course, is in there.
7062244	7062865	You gotta love that.
7063885	7064286	Yay.
7065326	7074613	No, there is like, they had an interactive device or whatever that you would buy for your PC that's for porno use or whatever, but it's interactive, you see, because it's
7075590	7088636	I just got a picture of Marissa and she said, were the boobies bigger than mine?
7089516	7090136	Not by much!
7091597	7092197	Not by much.
7092237	7093417	That's an impressive picture.
7093438	7095078	Marissa has the best rack ever.
7095198	7096719	That is an impressive picture.
7099141	7102883	I am completely secure in my homosexuality, okay?
7103204	7106686	I am 100% secure in my fagness.
7106987	7109228	But I want to bury my face in that.
7109909	7110769	I can't explain it.
7110789	7118115	That's because you have something that's built into male DNA, whether you're gay or not, that boobies are important.
7118915	7119716	Were you breastfed, Rob?
7120757	7120917	No.
7121717	7122338	That could be part of it.
7122799	7124300	Link, Link, Link, Link, Link, please, please, Link, Link, please
7146365	7148546	And Marissa says, gay man motorboat me all the time.
7148846	7154827	I tell you, if you post that link in chat, it's going to get really quiet in chat for about the next five minutes.
7156688	7158548	Anyhow, one more story for you guys.
7160369	7164130	And then we're going to get to the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR.
7164350	7167130	And we're going to travel the world here a little bit and go to Brazil.
7167791	7171572	And it sounds like Brazil is following in the footsteps of some other places around the world.
7173343	7173983	Thank you for watching.
7174023	7174483	See you next time.
7194710	7195510	Yes, it's in there twice.
7195811	7203294	Trading and custody, storage of the video games that affect the customs and traditions of the people, their worship, creeds, religions, and symbols.
7203794	7213439	In other words, they're basically trying to eliminate video games in bad taste, which could be violent video games and lots of things among that route.
7213899	7214399	You know what?
7214680	7217001	They've tried to do that many places and it never works.
7217601	7223064	Of course, Brazil isn't this country, but it would be sad to hear about that.
7227321	7230904	Just learn from... You can't stop freedom of expression.
7232745	7239851	I mean, as much as this, like, fleshlight pocket pussy thing is ridiculous, I love the fact that it can be made.
7240291	7240872	You know what I mean?
7241492	7243834	The fact that it exists brings me lulz.
7245715	7245856	So...
7247529	7255455	Alright, anyhow, we're going to go to the Skype line now, 1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
7255475	7258737	If you want to give us a call, we're going to take some calls right now.
7258898	7261640	The Skype line is open for business, taking your calls.
7262260	7265863	In the meantime, some last minute stories while we wait for the little delay there.
7265903	7267044	Loki, I don't know if you have anything to say.
7267064	7267344	I have one.
7267704	7268545	Oh, yes, Dark Sakura.
7268605	7269145	Boobs are great.
7269586	7270686	The end.
7271027	7272928	And we're getting a call, so let's take the phone.
7273489	7274669	Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
7274690	7275030	Who's this?
7276907	7278148	Hi, this is Spazinator.
7278308	7278868	Hi, Spazinator.
7278888	7279548	What's on your mind tonight?
7281909	7283970	Two things.
7284030	7290133	First, so far, this episode's got to be the best episode of all hours so far.
7290754	7291814	Well, thank you very much.
7292634	7294695	Is it because it's very porn-tastic tonight?
7297417	7298597	I'm sorry.
7298657	7300878	With my ear infections, it's kind of hard to hear you.
7300978	7301959	Could you repeat that, please?
7302039	7302499	That's all right.
7302559	7304280	Is it because we're porn-tastic tonight?
7306178	7309041	Oh yeah, I mean, well, not just that, you cover your what?
7309421	7313024	Boobs, vaginas, and bodily functions.
7313184	7320310	I mean, um, yeah, I, uh, there's probably stuff you're probably missing, but I, you can't think of it off the top of my head.
7320330	7321992	Uh, well, yeah, to, uh, get into the main point of my call, um,
7332935	7338179	Yeah, I kind of want to touch on something that you were mentioning towards the beginning of the show.
7338520	7339380	Yeah.
7340501	7345065	Well, mainly the whole rumor of the PSP Go add-on.
7345085	7359397	And it kind of relates to the whole, you know, whatchamacallit, project mentality and the motion controller for the PSP, you know, PS3 as well in a sense.
7360234	7369542	It's probably a good idea that the PSP add-on doesn't come out, simply because of one simple reason.
7369602	7379950	Traditionally speaking, add-ons for systems do really, really horrible in terms of sales and whatnot.
7380651	7383774	Classic examples are the Sega CD, the 32X.
7387440	7396623	and more recently the 360's HD DVD add-on and the PlayStation 2's hard drive.
7397363	7399384	That did lousy.
7400905	7414769	The simple reason for that is that add-ons kind of like splintered the market a little bit and game manufacturers can't rely on
7416231	7419154	and people buying these add-ons.
7420315	7426821	And therefore, they tend to shy away from catering to these add-ons.
7427581	7431505	There's a lot of add-ons that don't do very well because they're not very well supported.
7431545	7433827	They're made for one game and then that's it.
7433887	7438091	You can go back through gaming's history and there's just tons of stuff that just wasn't very well supported.
7439111	7439832	The Super Scope 6...
7442234	7446215	But some were also very good on the other side because they got a lot of support for them.
7446255	7452737	Like DDR Mats did very well because the games that came out with them, there was a ton of them and folks got use out of them.
7452777	7455038	And the guitar peripherals do very well too.
7455118	7463761	But don't forget too, the biggest difference here when you're talking about the PSP and what we were talking about at the beginning of the show is that you're having an add-on for something that should have been there in the first place.
7463781	7470263	It's ridiculous that you would get this add-on if you just go buy the PSP 3000 if you want a UMD.
7470383	7471683	It makes no sense at all.
7473328	7483015	Yeah, you definitely got a point there in both cases.
7483255	7499687	And also, like you mentioned, the DDR maps and Rock Band, Guitar Hero stuff does sell well, but you gotta bear in mind that that kind of stuff is kind of in a minority sense, and
7500851	7506473	The companies that put those stuff out are taking a really, really major risk with that stuff.
7507553	7528501	And in terms of Project Natal and Sony's motion controller, sure, I'm willing to bet that there will be some early adopters that will probably get it for the novelty of it, and probably would use that stuff for a while, up until the novelty wears off.
7528789	7548057	Well, you know what, peripherals, I think to some extent peripherals give sometimes developers, I think right now, a false sense of security because DDR's done so well, because Guitar Hero's done so well, but I think Tony Hawk at the right is going to bring them right back to reminding folks that peripherals don't always make the game, that's for sure, and especially the amount that folks spend on it.
7549058	7550979	Yeah, true.
7551279	7558182	Yeah, the only reason the Wii's remote and nunchuck did well
7558880	7564185	is because, in a sense, Nintendo got it right where they packed that stuff in.
7564625	7566087	Right, and that was the system.
7566287	7567968	Every single game has to support it.
7568008	7570270	Therefore, there's plenty of games out there that support it.
7570551	7576856	But it's very interesting, isn't it, that sometimes folks complain about the Wii is that they should make some games that don't support it.
7577016	7579378	You know, that don't overdo it with the motion controls.
7579879	7581240	The Wii's been very interesting.
7581420	7582041	Very interesting.
7583817	7584699	No, not that I can't go.
7592981	7593441	Have a good one.
7616072	7616953	Yeah, sure.
7617113	7620075	Mirror's Edge is going to be coming to the iPhone soon.
7620115	7622237	It's a little bit different than the normal Mirror's Edge.
7622277	7626801	It's actually kind of more of a side-scroll game, but it's still 3D.
7627101	7627542	It looks neat.
7628846	7629747	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
7629767	7630108	Who's this?
7631009	7632250	It's Ranma, one more time.
7632350	7632811	Hi, Ranma.
7632831	7633391	What's on your mind?
7633612	7634833	Lucky you, getting through two weeks in a row.
7634853	7635273	Not too much.
7636995	7639498	A couple of quick things, and I'll be on my merry little way.
7640419	7646626	First thing is, I don't know if you saw, but I made a retweet about President Cat coming to the U.S.
7647747	7648328	Did you see that?
7648548	7649930	No, wait, like for real?
7650922	7660189	Well, someone on Twitter, going by the name of SMAT454, whose real name is Matt Cokes, made a tweet to Renoise saying that President Cat's coming to the U.S.
7660649	7660989	Uh-huh.
7662110	7667214	And I retweeted it, but it just kind of fell right in the water, so I don't know if you guys had heard about it.
7667234	7667714	When was it?
7667774	7668375	Was it today?
7669376	7671337	No, actually, this was about three days ago.
7672778	7673539	No, I didn't see it.
7673579	7675300	I've been bad on keeping current on Twitter.
7675320	7676561	Would I see it on Renoise Twitter?
7677472	7680994	Yes, and I actually have the Twitter page up.
7681054	7682155	I can put it in the chat room.
7682555	7687759	And even though it makes for great radio, it's twitter.com slash smat454.
7687799	7691661	Well, wait, now they're saying President Cat the Revolution is coming to the U.S.
7692142	7695824	They're just talking about the fever, President Cat fever.
7695864	7696885	I don't think they mean a game.
7698626	7701608	If you look at a couple tweets before that, they're saying President Cat for the win.
7702008	7703229	We need President Cat.
7703489	7704910	I don't think they're talking about the actual game.
7705010	7705391	I wish.
7705771	7706872	He's probably a listener to this program.
7707732	7714213	Probably so, but when it came across to my feed, I'm automatically assuming, wait, someone picked up the rights to the game, it's coming over, you know?
7716134	7722995	I wish, but if these stories about the fact that it only sold 100 copies are true, maybe it won't happen, but, you know, again, I gotta be careful.
7723155	7726176	I don't want to make this the President and Cat show, but my point still stands.
7726516	7730217	This game would sell if it came out here, and it will sell much more than 100 copies.
7730977	7732637	I mean, hell, they made a sequel to We Cheer.
7733577	7734297	I know, right?
7735218	7736898	And Muscle, hello, Muscle March.
7737825	7738526	End of argument.
7739868	7742231	Yeah, you got a valid point on that one, yeah.
7743513	7744074	Exactly.
7744114	7746177	Well, anything else on your mind tonight, DJ Ranma?
7747338	7748179	Something interesting.
7748840	7751203	Saturday I called Best Buy.
7751484	7753006	I had an issue about my TV set.
7753612	7754433	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
7783812	7789078	You're good, provided you bought your console before, I believe, September of 2008.
7789619	7796766	I've actually, I want to say I've heard of this before, and it's because the red rings are covered under Microsoft's warranty, and Best Buy don't want to have anything to do with it anymore.
7797687	7799870	Well, it looks like I got lucky when mine red ringed.
7800447	7802008	It's the way you need to do it anyways.
7802028	7802809	True, but the funny thing is
7828224	7837958	I used to work for them, and under this coverage, if someone brought the console back, whatever console it was, Best Buy would still get the full credit on it anyway, back from the manufacturer, so...
7838919	7840479	That's the part that kind of threw me off.
7840860	7842000	Maybe it's an administrative thing.
7842020	7842480	I don't know.
7843740	7844020	Strange.
7844461	7844741	All right.
7844781	7847041	Well, Ranma, thank you so much for the call.
7847221	7849702	And thanks for the heads up on Best Buy.
7849722	7853963	If folks didn't already know, it's something to think about, especially this holiday season as you're buying people Xboxes.
7853983	7860105	And also the other thing to think of possibly as a reason why they wouldn't take it back too is they could just say, oh, yeah, Red Ringed.
7860905	7862926	And in reality, their console got banned.
7864025	7864365	Don't.
7864385	7875210	Yeah, because the thing is, they're supposed to pop open the consoles and test it out and make sure, Red Ring or whatever, because that's what I did when I worked at Geeksville or something and brought back defective PS2s and Xboxes.
7875250	7880453	When I showed my 360 in the box, they took it, grabbed me another one off the shelf, and I'm like, here you go.
7882154	7882854	And it was a slow day, too.
7886491	7886792	All right.
7887333	7889576	Well, we're going to let you go, Ranma, so we can get some more calls.
7889716	7890418	But thank you guys.
7890558	7892721	Thank you so much, as always, for calling in, okay?
7893403	7893903	And upon you.
7894104	7894665	Have a good week.
7895326	7895526	You too.
7896762	7905506	877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio and that's the place to get in on the Skype line if you have anything you want to talk about tonight on the program.
7906006	7907427	Other last minute stories we have, Loki?
7907447	7907827	Yeah, sure.
7907967	7922314	There's a PlayStation Network game that's going to be nearly 10 gigabytes in size and it's the PlayStation Network title Record of Argrist War and apparently it's a strategy RPG
7923894	7928797	And it's coming to North America by Axis Games localization.
7929117	7939984	One of the companies I said to send the president cat emails to because they localize all sorts of weird stuff, including this game that has apparently anime chicks seductively eating sausages.
7941324	7942685	Oh, joy and rapture.
7943866	7945527	This picture here.
7945647	7946547	Too much porn tonight.
7948469	7948949	Yeah.
7949338	7952727	I know there's no such thing as too much porn, but tonight might be pushing the limit.
7952987	7953448	I'm just saying.
7954662	7957123	I might have to put the explicit tag on tonight's show for once.
7958003	7958844	Anyhow, we got another call.
7958864	7959884	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
7959904	7960304	Who's this?
7960905	7961785	Hey, this is X-Ling.
7961805	7963005	You never have too much porn.
7963025	7964146	What are you talking about?
7964366	7965406	Clearly, I'm smoking crack.
7965526	7967067	That means we're Orange Lounge Pornio.
7967767	7969808	X-Ling, I'm sorry to make you wait there for a little bit, but what's on your mind?
7970008	7971029	Hey, no, no problem.
7971049	7971469	Not at all.
7971489	7977431	This has been a great show from everything from snow to boobs to flashlights.
7977791	7978972	To snow boob flashlights.
7979032	7979192	I know.
7979232	7979492	And food.
7979592	7981853	It's been an amazing night.
7982133	7983774	Well, I found a little bit of information.
7983834	7984494	It was interesting.
7984534	7987375	I ran into you about this before, and I told you to look this up.
7987415	7990397	I don't know if you did or not, but they were talking about Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep.
7990437	7993618	Of course, it's going to be hitting over in Japan on January 9th.
7994318	8003522	But Jesse McCarthy, on his tweet back about November 30th, put up a tweet and says, Recording yet another Kingdom Hearts game.
8003662	8005143	All you gamers, eat your heart out.
8005683	8006804	Man, what a process, though.
8006864	8008144	The first recording was in 2005 for Game 1.
8010199	8016663	Which I think they said that actually the first game came out in the US in 2002, which then they said Part 2 came out in 2005.
8016723	8028650	But nonetheless though, which they're talking about, hopefully that means that we will be getting Birth by Sleep here come sometime maybe either middle of next year or possibly the year after.
8028730	8030351	So I'm definitely looking forward to that.
8030972	8034714	I'm kind of not surprised that it's making its way over here.
8035891	8037072	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
8057046	8057466	Let's hope.
8057786	8070733	You know I'm all about the Kingdom Hearts Part 3, but it also makes sense, you know, and I think this point got brought up a couple episodes ago, is that that team has been hard at work on Versus 13, which we've had very little information about, so you know that that game is still heavy under development.
8070793	8081238	I think once Versus 13 finally looks like it's nearing gold status and it's on its way out, which, honestly, at this point, I don't think is going to happen until 2011, I think we'll have more.
8081578	8082439	Because, you know, I think...
8082919	8083659	Here's my thought, actually.
8083779	8087901	Versus XIII, I think is going to be a big thing at E3 2010 for Square.
8088201	8092563	Because at that point, Final Fantasy XIII, non-Versus, the regular one, will be out.
8093263	8097465	Now that we know the release date for XIII, it'll be out in Japan, it'll be out here in the US.
8097785	8098565	That's done now.
8098925	8100906	So I think Versus XIII will be big.
8101086	8103027	And maybe they'll make a Kingdom Hearts announcement?
8103627	8108931	but I think that's what's going to be their big thing at E3 this year.
8108951	8110513	I'm sorry.
8110953	8127126	My prediction would be that the Kingdom Hearts and also they've been showing teasers especially over in Japan for it but the Parasite Eve the third birthday was also been teased over in Japan which of course did very well.
8127186	8129648	The first two did very well over here I believe in the US.
8129688	8131850	Yeah, surprising they never did a third one.
8132432	8133352	I still wish they'd translate the book.
8133373	8133933	I remember Parasite Eve.
8133953	8136114	I remember a story that we covered on the show.
8136214	8140136	It was a while ago, probably about a year and a half ago, but I remember this has come up on the show before.
8140156	8140817	It's being done.
8140877	8142958	I seem to recall it was on the PSP, too.
8160347	8168830	But it's a little weird that that's the direction they're going with it when they could do something, you know, epic on the PS3, but, you know, whatever, or 360, whatever they want to do.
8168850	8173532	I imagine that's something they're going to pull out of their hat at E3.
8173752	8174432	I'd be with you there.
8175353	8176893	I'm just surprised to see what they will do.
8177233	8180875	I mean, they're just going to try to, you know, go for it, you know, so if they do, that's great.
8180935	8181415	If not, then...
8183479	8184661	Alright, well, excellent.
8184681	8190052	Thank you so much for the call, and we're going to let you go so we can wrap up the show, but thank you so much as always, and have a good night, okay?
8190393	8190974	Of course, thanks.
8191074	8191335	Later.
8191896	8192056	Later.
8193035	8194576	That's going to do it for tonight's Skype line.
8194616	8195997	Thank you so much to our callers tonight.
8196017	8196817	We really appreciate it.
8196857	8198498	Sorry to those folks that didn't get through tonight.
8198919	8200519	But it's weird.
8200559	8202401	Tonight's show's been moving very fast.
8203381	8205963	We're actually probably going to end a little bit earlier than usual.
8205983	8206503	But you know what?
8206543	8208724	It's also that time of year where the games are out now.
8209285	8213227	So there's not a whole lot of, you know, people are going to be sleeping through December.
8213287	8217069	And we'll get more game news come January, especially with all of these postponements.
8217489	8220431	I think first and second quarter 2010 are going to be very interesting.
8220691	8221732	First quarter's pretty interesting.
8221932	8224373	All these games that got delayed are finally going to come out.
8224393	8225593	It's going to be very interesting.
8226053	8227874	But anyhow, we saw some last-minute stories, right, Loki?
8228374	8229555	Yeah.
8229775	8239038	And then other than Mirror's Edge, there's also some other decent games coming to the iPhone, including the iPhone version of Ace Combat 11.
8240962	8242143	or XI, I guess.
8243923	8245864	That's coming from Namco, of course.
8246024	8247145	It looks pretty awesome.
8247765	8255469	And they're also updating, I guess, Garters and Ghouls in relation to Ghosts and Goblins.
8255529	8257090	I was going to say, that's what it sounds like.
8257110	8258310	Is that like Ghosts and Goblins?
8258430	8260712	It's a zombie killing game.
8261152	8267835	And it allows you, they're going to have GPS support in it now, so you can move your iPhone around to turn your player in the game.
8268283	8271145	Actdeft wants to point out that's Ace Combat She, not Eleven.
8271265	8271506	She.
8271706	8275929	Because Ace Combat 6 was the last one, so you wouldn't jump right to Eleven.
8276290	8278131	Yeah, but you never... Okay, so She.
8278772	8280012	And let's see, what else?
8280033	8284176	So Sirius Sam, the second encounter, is also getting the HD treatment as well.
8284436	8289200	And if I remember correctly, the first one still hasn't come out yet, but, you know...
8290060	8290561	XBOX Live Arcade
8306209	8314453	Lips Party Classics will be coming out on the Xbox 360 in 2010, apparently in the spring.
8314533	8334804	It will feature 40 new tracks, including The Love Shack by the B-52s, Tub Thumping by Chubba Wumba, I Will Survive by Gloria Gaynor, Rock and Roll All Night by KISS, Wannabe by Spice Girls, I Think We're Alone Now by Tiffany, and YMCA by The Village People.
8335664	8342506	and of course, you know, your typical karaoke game.
8343327	8353750	And then finally, to kind of elaborate a little bit more on what the Record of Argus War was, that's a game that had that soul breed function in there.
8353810	8359072	Basically, you find these women and you breed with them to create a new hero.
8359092	8361953	Okay.
8361973	8362053	Okay.
8362987	8363267	DarkSakura
8392520	8393440	Your final thought tonight?
8393880	8394600	My hands hurt.
8395081	8395641	Sorry to hear that.
8395721	8396141	Loki.
8397461	8398321	My hands don't hurt.
8400502	8402382	My final thought is I want a taco.
8402962	8403683	That's my final thought.
8403723	8406503	I think that was my final thought last week, but I again want a taco, just so you know.
8407183	8409224	That's going to do it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
8409284	8410404	Believe it or not, we're coming to a close.
8410424	8413245	I know it's a little early tonight, but like I said, it's a little bit of a slower news week.
8413605	8414985	Not as much to discuss as usual.
8415505	8418506	Live listeners, though, stay tuned because we have a little extra something after the show as usual.
8418906	8447997	for those of you guys listening on the podcast though that's going to do it thank you guys so much for downloading and supporting our program we really appreciate it again all we ask you know we do this stuff for free so please tell two people about the show I know especially ever since the launch of the Facebook page a lot of you guys have really been selling the show to your friends we really appreciate that and the word of mouth goes a very long way and you know just want to let you guys know it's really appreciated because we don't really have advertising dollars we don't have a big magazine supporting us you know we're not on TV or anything fancy like that so word of mouth is all we got
8448337	8449258	So we really appreciate it.
8449678	8451960	And if you didn't like our program, that's okay.
8452340	8453180	We don't hate you that much.
8453521	8458324	But do check out some of the other programs on allgames.com, some other great independent podcasts that talk about other things.
8458464	8466750	You know, if you don't like us because we don't talk enough modern warfare, there's a show on there that talks much more about first-person shooters or whatever might be up your alley.
8467230	8468891	So thank you guys, of course, as always.
8469331	8470893	And we'll do it all again next week.
8471253	8475496	Except remember, guys, next week, sadly, not live, but it will be pre-taped.
8476056	8480642	If we can pre-tape it live, stay tuned to the Twitter and the Facebook for all that information.
8481563	8484006	Meanwhile, that's going to do it for another edition of Orange Lounge Radio.
8484727	8485368	Until next week.
8486389	8491131	I'm Rob Roberts, she's DarkSakura, he's Loki, and we're out.
8508078	8510581	or allgames.com but we're probably right anyway see you next week
