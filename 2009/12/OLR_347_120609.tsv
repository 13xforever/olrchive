0	18240	Today, December 6, 2009, Steam is about to get some more competition.
18240	21080	Could you soon play PSP Minis on your PS3?
21080	32880	And the long-lasting video game rumor is revealed to be true this week.
32880	36640	Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge
36640	37640	Radio.
37640	41180	We are that video game talk show dedicated to, of course, video games.
41180	44600	Video gaming, gaming culture, the gamer lifestyle, and food!
44600	46180	Lots and lots of food!
46180	47180	And crocheting.
47180	48260	Nom nom nom.
48260	49260	And yarn.
49260	52400	I'm doing a third crocheting because I don't have the patience for that stuff.
52400	53400	And you've crocheted.
53400	56840	By the way, of course, the one and only, Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers, and I'm Rob Roberts.
56840	57840	I'm making a hat.
57840	58840	And he's Techmaster Loki.
58840	59840	Why not just introduce him too?
59840	60840	How you doing, Techmaster Loki?
60840	61840	I'm doing fine.
61840	62840	Amazing.
62840	63840	Okay, so crocheting.
63840	64840	I don't have the patience for that.
64840	65840	Okay.
65840	66840	Just saying.
66840	70040	I didn't think I did either, but it's actually fairly therapeutic.
70040	71040	Do you, what do you do?
71040	75480	Like, because I know a lot of people will watch TV while they crochet or, you know,
75480	76480	do whatever.
76480	79240	Do you have an activity that you do when you crochet?
79240	82640	I sit in front of my computer and chat with Becky.
82640	84240	Or whoever else is on.
84240	85240	And watch random YouTubers?
85240	86240	No.
86240	89320	Well, sometimes I'll watch other people crocheting while I crochet.
89320	93240	It's sort of like eating food while you're watching Food Network or watching porn while
93240	94240	you fuck.
94240	99120	Or in my case, watching The Biggest Loser while eating a giant pizza.
99120	100120	That's what I like to do.
100120	101480	It makes me feel good about myself.
101480	103400	Techmaster Loki, how are you doing?
103400	105200	How's your week going?
105200	106200	It's okay.
106200	107200	Yeah?
107200	108200	Just okay?
108200	109200	Yeah, it's all right.
109200	110200	I'm sorry to hear it's not awesome.
110200	113600	It'd be more awesome if I didn't break a PSP.
113600	114600	Uh oh.
114600	115600	All right.
115600	116600	What happened?
116600	119280	So the further adventures of your, for those that heard last week's show, which sadly hasn't
119280	122080	hit the podcast, we had an internal issue here.
122080	125440	One of the files didn't make it to our server, so we didn't get the podcast up on time.
125440	127160	It'll be up very soon.
127160	131160	But you've been working on a homebrew PSP machine, right?
131160	132160	Yeah.
132160	135040	PSP arcade cabinet, I guess.
135040	136640	Sort of bar top cabinet.
136640	138080	That looks ghetto.
138080	140480	There's pictures of it at orangeonshade.com at the top.
140480	141480	It's awesome.
141480	142480	No, it's ghetto awesome.
142480	143480	Yes.
143480	146040	So there's something, I don't know what happened with it.
146040	151800	It was something because I had wired up the analog stick to the directional joystick that
151800	152800	I had.
152800	153800	And there's a way you can do it.
153800	154800	It's pretty easy.
154800	159960	And the contact points are a lot bigger than trying to solder to the small, really tiny
159960	165800	ribbon cable solder points that are for the actual digital directional pad.
165800	168880	So I figured, okay, I'll just solder to that.
168880	171760	Well, something happened, and I'm not sure what.
171760	175400	I thought I bridged something, but apparently that wasn't the case.
175400	182640	And for whatever reason, the PSP seemed like it was only pressing down, and it just consistently
182640	185740	held down, down.
185740	190640	So that made it hard to kind of select games, play anything, because it would be always
190640	192420	pressing down.
192420	196360	So I figured, okay, I'm going to look at it and see what I did solder-wise.
196360	203400	And I looked at what was supposed to be bridged to enable down to be pressed, and it was impossible
203400	206720	for me to have done something to actually cause that.
206720	211560	So I actually broke something in there somewhere.
211560	213520	Unfortunately I can't fix that.
213520	220580	So I'm just going to kind of take a break from it right now, because there's not much
220580	221580	I can really do with it.
221580	224200	Well it's going to be frustrating that you build this whole machine and then it just
224200	225200	oops.
225200	226200	Well yeah, it was all ready to go.
226200	230720	I had some trouble earlier in the week, I couldn't get it to stay powered on, and that
230720	236800	I realized was a mistake because I had hooked up a push button backwards, so it was hooked
236800	240880	to the normally open instead of the normally closed.
240880	246840	And that causes it to basically, when the button's not being pressed, the button is
246840	249660	pressed, and then when you push the button, the button isn't pressed.
249660	251820	So it's kind of backwards.
251820	256560	And once I fixed that, it worked just fine, powered up, everything was hunky dory, and
256560	263240	then I tested what buttons worked and what didn't, and apparently my R button didn't
263240	269160	really work, which I'm guessing is because the solder point was super tiny, so I probably
269160	274160	missed it when I was soldering, and my triangle button wasn't working, which I didn't really
274160	281600	even get to the point to fix that yet, and then the constantly pressing down thing, which
281600	284880	was kind of annoying.
284880	286720	But that's really it.
286720	292680	Otherwise, it worked enough for me to try out one of the games and it looked awesome.
292680	296660	It sort of worked, it's just not quite everything yet.
296660	302000	But there's a lot of it that's salvageable, and honestly, if I want to try again, I mean,
302000	308280	PSPs are dirt cheap, if I look on Craigslist, I can get one sub $50, so if I wanted to do
308280	309280	that.
309280	314720	And at the same time, I actually figured out a way requiring an extra device to be purchased,
314720	321080	but there is a way that's actually super easy to do that, and not only will I be able to
321080	325680	use the PSP in the arcade cabinet, it won't actually damage the PSP and I can actually
325680	332600	take it out of the arcade cabinet for whatever reason, so I may go that route if I decide
332600	337160	I really want to do this, but at the same time, I've got parts for Bartop actually coming,
337160	342880	so I don't really, it doesn't matter anyways, because I will have a working Bartop cabinet.
342880	347120	I love that you just haven't totally given up, it'll come back stronger, PSP Cabinet
347120	348120	2.0.
348120	349120	Yeah.
349120	350120	Bigger and better.
350120	353000	And at the same time, it was kind of a learning experience, because now I know how to solder
353000	360520	slightly better, not enough to where I need to solder these like really small wires onto
360520	364160	these contacts, and it was just, it was a mess.
364160	367600	It was super delicate, I mean there was so much that could have gone wrong, and a lot
367600	374400	of it did, and it was just, it wasn't pretty, so the second time around it'll be a lot better,
374400	380040	and a lot cleaner, and should work, but when I actually get around to that, I don't know,
380040	386080	because I have a lot of other things I've got to work on, so it will not be forgotten,
386080	387640	it will be taken care of at some point.
387640	391440	Plus it's just a busy time of year, you know, this isn't the best time to start a big project,
391440	392440	so.
392440	395220	Well I have other projects, you know, and I tend to start projects when I have other
395220	400280	projects going, and don't finish things, and I have my arcade cabinet, you know, the actual
400280	404920	arcade cabinet that I've, you know, got everything almost ready for that, I was just working
404920	410760	on the front end to, you know, get some of the themes I had for hyperspin the work correctly,
410760	415600	and you know, otherwise it's ready to go, so I may just play around with that, actually
415600	420720	enjoy the fruits of my labor, and then later on, you know, tackle this stuff.
420720	427000	Actually, I, for whatever reason on an impulse buy, I purchased a, what they call a, a Dingo
427000	434920	A320, which, you know, it's not an actual Dingo, but it's a little, um, little small
434920	440440	portable emulation device, actually, that you can use to, it actually has built-in emulators
440440	449400	for Neo Geo, CPS 1 and 2, NES, Genesis, you name it, and it actually has video out on
449400	454840	it and stuff, and I actually have looked at a picture of it taken apart, and I probably
454840	460080	could turn that into a cabinet as well, if I wanted to, in place of this, because I could
460080	467760	hook up the video out to an old PS1 LCD monitor that I have still, so maybe, but then again,
467760	471560	you know, it's pretty nice and I don't want to kind of mess that up, so I'll just probably
471560	477160	get another PSP and just do it, I'll fix it this time, but other than that, you know,
477160	481480	um, yeah, that's pretty much what I've been doing, other than, you know, Grand Theft Auto
481480	482480	and stuff.
482480	486000	Alright, well, I was going to get into gaming weeks, but you pretty much took the cake with
486000	487000	that one, that's alright.
487000	491080	Let's go over to Jamie, how was your gaming week, Dark Sakura?
491080	495320	I played, I played World of Warcraft and knitted, or crocheted.
495320	497960	Yes, did you crochet while playing World of Warcraft?
497960	498960	Yes actually I did.
498960	499960	That's talented.
499960	500960	Yesterday.
500960	501960	Uh huh.
501960	505320	I basically, um, because I was doing some stuff on my Night Elf, I just basically go,
505320	510240	okay, I'm tired of playing, you know, hide, that, whatever that racial ability is to blend
510240	511240	into shadows.
511240	512240	Right.
512240	513240	You know, hide.
513240	515200	Okay, I'm done playing.
515200	517040	So yeah, that was about what I did.
517040	518040	Very cool.
518040	519040	Um, let's see.
519040	522720	Oh, and watch Dan play Borderlands.
522720	525600	I watched a little bit of that, I'm not super familiar with Borderlands, although I've heard
525600	528760	a lot of good things about it, and I was watching Dan play a little bit of it as I was walking
528760	529760	in tonight.
529760	534320	It looks, uh, it looks very comic book- I like the crazy mutant midgets.
534320	535320	Is that what they're actually called?
535320	538120	Yes, the crazy mutant midgets or something like that.
538120	539120	Amazing.
539120	541560	Um, Loki, was there anything else for your gaming week, I know you're talking about hacks,
541560	543080	other games you've been playing?
543080	545080	Just Grand Theft Auto.
545080	546080	That's pretty much it.
546080	550800	I, you know, all the opportunity that I had to play games this weekend, I was just too
550800	553920	busy working on that stupid box cabinet thing.
553920	554920	Nice.
554920	559460	Um, let's see, my gaming week, uh, two new games, one just a demo, so I can't really
559460	563680	tell you about the game, but the demo I played was Bayonetta, and didn't know a whole lot
563680	567400	about the game, like I kinda knew it was like a Devil May Cry-ish game with a hot chick
567400	568400	as the main character.
568400	569400	That's awesome.
569400	573400	I didn't know a whole lot about it, but one of my friends was like, no, you really, really
573400	577240	need to play this demo, it's quite astounding, and I was like, okay, I'll check it out, you
577240	578240	know, what have I got to lose?
578240	579480	I'm not paying anything for it.
579480	583480	So um, went over to his place and saw it on a 360, because you know mine's been broken
583480	587320	for a while now, and uh, was blown away.
587320	588600	It's amazing.
588600	591640	And so I actually sat down to play it, just played it on normal mode, because I was like,
591640	596560	should I play it on normal or easy, and normal of course, so played through it, um, a little
596560	602720	bit of button mashing, but fun, way fun, and you know, there is a science to it, and um,
602720	606280	you know, you have your punches and your kicks and your jump, but a lot of the game revolves
606280	610000	around being able to block at just the right time that will activate what's called the
610000	614360	witch time, where things slow down and get more matrix-y, and then, you know, you can
614360	619000	do these finishing moves that are called tortures, where you might push somebody into one of
619000	625160	those statues with the spikes in it that'll slam shut on them, or guillotine, but what
625160	627840	makes this game great is a couple of things.
627840	630440	How amazingly over-the-freaking-top it is.
630440	637360	It's obviously extremely violent, blood everywhere, heads rolling, just, you know, extreme violence,
637360	643640	and uh, just the little touches make it fabulous, like, for instance, when she will kick a demon
643640	647800	into the guillotine, she snaps her fingers for the blades to fall, and little hearts
647800	650280	appear above the, um, fingers.
650280	655280	Her shadow is an image of a butterfly, which is a symbol that you see throughout the game,
655280	661320	and you know, just all these little, uh, it's so over-the-top, I was laughing and laughing
661320	665960	and laughing, and just this move where, like, you spin the controller, like, 360 degrees
665960	669380	and hit one of the buttons, and then she'll get on the ground and start, like, her high
669380	673600	heels are guns, so she starts shooting from her high heels, and you can actually, like,
673600	679260	aim at the monsters, it is insanity, and I loved every minute of it, so I am so excited
679260	683160	for the full version of the game, because it was just so over-the-top, and some of the
683160	688520	boss fights were extremely silly, I, I can't believe how much I enjoyed this game, because
688520	693900	it's not usually the type of game I'm all into, but just the absurdness and over-the-topness
693900	697800	and the design of the characters, I can see why now this game is getting all the praise
697800	698800	it is.
698800	701400	I, I, uh, I, I had a good time.
701400	703780	And by the way, did you notice she's wearing her hair?
703780	708120	Her hair is like her weapon, and she turns her hair into demons that will bite the heads
708120	709120	off of monsters.
709120	710120	She has witch hair.
710120	716640	Which conveniently leaves her with a naked booty, or a thong or something, so, who would
716640	719000	win in a fight, Bayonetta or the Baroness?
719000	723160	Uh, I, I would have to say, Bayonetta is gonna just kick her into a guillotine and snap her
723160	727720	fingers and it's over, so, you know, with, with all due respect to the, the, the Baroness.
727720	730960	I guess they're saying, uh, in chat room, uh, Tiger Claw says, Bayonetta looks like
730960	731960	the Baroness.
731960	736680	And if you want to join us in our chat, chat.orangelauntrader.com, of course, is always the place you can do
736680	737680	that.
737680	742760	And I really do need to play that game, because I have my, my Japanese 360 now, and I actually
742760	743760	do have the game.
743760	747360	I just haven't played it yet, because I've been working on crap like, you know.
747360	751000	You really need to, you need to play it, and seriously, call me when you do, because I
751000	753480	want to hear your initial impressions before next week's show.
753480	755000	You need to bring it over.
755000	758240	Yeah, I, I want to play the full one.
758240	759240	Looks like fun.
759240	764440	All right, anyhow, um, also my gaming week, um, not a demo, but, uh, a full game, and
764440	766240	one I've been intending to play for a while.
766240	770360	New Super Mario Brothers Wii, which is a game I played at E3, and I was kind of like, yeah,
770360	771360	it's okay.
771360	775000	You know, I, I, I played it with one of the nice booth babes there, who was trying to
775000	778440	show me the parts of the game, and obviously I was getting into the multiplayer experience,
778440	780460	and I was like, yeah, it's okay.
780460	783600	But I wish that they would go back, and I said this on the show a couple weeks ago,
783600	789120	I said, I really want them to go back and make, like, Super Mario Brothers 4, or something
789120	790120	like that.
790120	795040	Like, a game like the old Mario Brothers, that kind of, without all this, like, extra
795040	798560	frilly stuff that they've kind of done in some of the more recent Mario releases, and
798560	800400	3D, and all that stuff.
800400	804040	And I have to admit, I was wrong.
804040	805160	This is that game.
805160	806560	This is the game I wanted.
806560	811880	This is the new, it really is the new Super Mario Brothers, with everything that you remember
811880	815000	from the old games, with the addition of multiplayer.
815000	818440	And so I totally misjudged this game in the beginning, and I think it's amazing.
818440	821120	I have, I had a lot of fun playing this game.
821120	825280	I really enjoyed the single-player mode, kind of, it's really just a hybrid.
825280	829720	Like, there's so much throwbacks to all the old Mario games, like, it's like, you have
829720	834220	a map that reminds you of Mario 3 with the minigames, but then you have Yoshi and a lot
834220	839760	of the monsters from, you know, Super Mario World, and then it's just, it's just really
839760	843800	interesting kind of how all the Mario games kind of blend together into this.
843800	847680	And then on top of that, there's this multiplayer mode, which is kind of, it's really fun.
847680	850000	It's a great party game.
850000	854920	It's a little bit difficult, because you can really unintentionally kill people and hurt
854920	859520	them, and there's no way to really make the difficulty easier.
859520	864380	And as I heard Bobby mention on his show, of course, Bobby Blackwell's always on before
864380	868580	we are at All Games Radio and we broadcast live on Sunday nights, he was kind of talking
868580	873280	about how there wasn't really a tutorial mode, so if you've never played a Mario game before,
873280	874560	there's a lot of stuff you miss.
874560	878960	And I kind of agree with that, like, if the game has one flaw, it was that I didn't know
878960	884400	you could hit the A button to avoid death in multiplayer mode until a little ways into
884400	885400	it playing with friends.
885400	889540	And I suppose the discovery of it was okay, but yeah, I would have liked, since, you know,
889540	894620	this is supposed to be something for everyone, there to be a little more of a basic tutorial
894620	899840	mode, but honestly, that's a very minor flaw in what is otherwise a stellar game and just
899840	903520	a really fun multiplayer experience with a lot of variety.
903520	907440	You know, there's some new suits, like the propeller suit and the penguin suit, and now
907440	913400	you have ice balls as well as fireballs, and, you know, they do add a little, some new mechanics
913400	917400	with the Wiimote, but it's nothing too crazy or over the top, like you can tilt the Wiimote
917400	922160	to tilt some platforms and some levels, and you shake it to do a helicopter type move
922160	923680	when you have the propeller suit on.
923680	929280	It's nothing too crazy, so I was really happy for this game.
929280	933600	Reading some comments from chat, Zappy says, I guess Sky never played Super Mario Brothers
933600	934600	on the DS.
934600	935600	Actually, that's not true.
935600	940560	I did play it on the DS, but you have to kind of go back and remember that I have an extreme
940560	945280	bias against handheld games, especially when they are porting over games that I remember
945280	950440	from consoles, and I am the first to admit, it's completely irrational and stupid, but
950440	955760	I don't like games I remember from my television playing big on my big sound speaker, larger
955760	960040	than life, pushed into a little itty bitty box.
960040	962280	I don't really often play portable games.
962280	966480	I have a PSP, yes, I have a DS, yes, but I find that most of the time I play it is when
966480	970360	I'm on a plane, and I really have literally nothing else I can play.
970360	974880	I have this weird bias against portable gaming that is completely irrational and I can't
974880	978680	explain, and so for that reason, I think I've never really given Super Mario Brothers DS
978680	983160	the credit it deserves, so I'll admit it.
983160	989600	Let's see, trying to look for some other questions from chat, let's see, again, if you want to
989600	994680	join our chat, chat.orangelaunchradio.com, and I think they're talking about some other
994680	997560	games, they're talking about Tekken and stuff in chat right now, which I did not play during
997560	1002880	my gaming week, but between those couple games and a little bit of other things here and
1002880	1007080	there, you know, not a whole lot of other major games this week, but I really enjoyed
1007080	1011160	Super Mario Brothers Wii, and you know, it's weird because every time, I know we've given
1011160	1014960	Nintendo a hard time on this show, and we've come on here and we've said, you know, Nintendo
1014960	1019940	is so out of touch with gaming, they don't, you know, they're not getting it, and Microsoft
1019940	1023440	and Sony are doing all these things online that are, you know, miles ahead of what the
1023440	1028240	Wii is doing, but then, damn, they always release a game like this that really reminds
1028240	1032960	you, they do know how to do fun, it's just that, unfortunately, it's, you know, you only
1032960	1037320	get a couple of these releases a year that kind of remind you of that fact, so.
1037320	1040800	But I do recommend the game, especially, you know, if you played Mario 1 growing up, if
1040800	1044840	you have that same desire I have, god, I wish they'd make a game like Mario 3 or Mario World
1044840	1045840	again.
1045840	1046840	This is that game.
1046840	1049280	And then there's multiplayer in it to boot that's actually kind of fun, except for the
1049280	1052240	fact that the princess isn't in it, but, you know, she got kidnapped again, what can you
1052240	1053240	do?
1053240	1056640	Of course, they could have, like, kidnapped Daisy, and I don't know, but whatever.
1056640	1059560	All of her guards need to seriously...
1059560	1060560	They need to get fired.
1060560	1063880	No, they need to commit seppuku for their dishonor.
1063880	1065480	Clearly, clearly.
1065480	1067000	And she needs to hire better guards.
1067000	1071840	Let's see, a comment from chat, Ricky Go Max says, I would play that Peach's Quest.
1071840	1076640	You know, there was a game like that on DS, speaking of DS and everything, there was a
1076640	1079160	Princess Peach game, Super Princess Peach, wasn't it called?
1079160	1080160	Yeah.
1080160	1081160	It was different, though.
1081160	1082160	It wasn't really a Mario game.
1082160	1086320	See, that was one of those, like, Nintendo, like, trying to take a Mario thing, and it
1086320	1088680	was okay, but it wasn't Mario Brothers.
1088680	1090280	It was Super PMS.
1090280	1092360	Yeah, she used her emotions.
1092360	1094480	I remember the emotions was a big part of that game.
1094480	1095840	A little silly.
1095840	1100720	So anyhow, let's get into some housekeeping tonight, some housekeeping on Wednesday.
1100720	1102560	We will not be live next week.
1102560	1105560	We will not have a live show next week, and that's completely my fault.
1105560	1109020	I'm going to be out of town next Sunday.
1109020	1113160	It's really no secret I'm going to see Lady Gaga in concert, and I couldn't be more excited,
1113160	1114840	so sorry, guys.
1114840	1116680	Opportunities like this don't happen every week.
1116680	1118200	So I'm not going to be here live.
1118200	1119660	I believe we're going to pre-tape.
1119660	1122120	We're still trying to figure out what time we're pre-taping.
1122120	1126560	I have to talk to Loki after the show, see if he's down with Saturday afternoon.
1126560	1131520	And if it works out and it works in the all-game schedule that we could maybe go live when
1131520	1137640	we pre-tape and not have to bump a show to do it, I would love to ask all games if we
1137640	1138640	can go live.
1138640	1144680	So stay tuned to our Twitter and our Facebook, twitter.com slash o-l-r and facebook.com slash
1144680	1148880	Orange Launch Radio, all one word, and of course our website, orangelaunchradio.com,
1148880	1151760	for the details on when that pre-taping will happen.
1151760	1155560	So again, if you are used to coming here Sunday nights and listening, you're still going to
1155560	1156680	get a new show next week.
1156680	1158280	You will hear a new show Sunday night.
1158280	1159820	It just won't be live.
1159820	1164400	And you know, un-live shows are always a bit of a bummer because you don't have the chat
1164400	1168240	room and the phone calls and all that, but we're hoping we'll still have a couple hours
1168240	1170000	of some good hilarity.
1170000	1172000	And hopefully we'll get to tape live a little early.
1172000	1173000	That would be great.
1173000	1175000	So we'll see what happens.
1175000	1176000	Okay.
1176000	1177480	Anyhow, let's move into some gaming news.
1177480	1179640	We're only 20 minutes into the show, right?
1179640	1181080	It's about time for some gaming news.
1181080	1183080	Loki, start us off tonight.
1183080	1184080	Yes.
1184080	1189960	So, starting things off, this is kind of interesting, but not too surprising.
1189960	1193960	Games for Windows Live, they've decided to add Games on Demand.
1193960	1199580	You may remember that's a service that's been available right now on Xbox Live as their
1199580	1201680	kind of digital download service.
1201680	1205240	And of course, trying to compete with Steam a little bit, I think, they're going to start
1205240	1211360	doing their Games on Demand service starting the beginning of December 15th.
1211360	1218360	And apparently, some of the games that they're talking about adding for the initial lineup
1218360	1224040	is going to be Resident Evil 5, Red Faction Guerrilla, Battle Station Specific, as well
1224040	1235520	as some Game for Windows Live-enabled versions of World of Goo and Osmose.
1235520	1237840	And I don't know.
1237840	1238840	That's kind of interesting.
1238840	1243160	They haven't really set any prices yet on what the games will cost.
1243160	1246560	Well, I imagine a lot of it's going to be competitively priced or similar to what you
1246560	1248760	see on store shelves.
1248760	1252560	That's pretty much what we've come to expect from Steam, but I think a large reason people
1252560	1255520	really like Steam is that they do sales all the freaking time.
1255520	1259920	And if I remember correctly, I believe isn't Games for Windows Live kind of tied in with
1259920	1261400	Windows 7 a little bit?
1261400	1264360	Because I remember when they were showing us some of the stuff for Windows 7, there
1264360	1268960	was kind of a game marketplace or whatever that you could download, like a bunch of casual
1268960	1270200	stuff, and whatnot.
1270200	1273400	I just upgraded to 7 a week ago.
1273400	1278660	Well, let me put it this way, I've been running it on my laptop, because remember we got the
1278660	1282160	release candidate at E3, like many of you out there on the internet downloaded, so I've
1282160	1287160	been running that on my laptop for some time, ever since I got it in July.
1287160	1289640	And that's what made me decide that I like Windows 7.
1289640	1293720	I like it much more than the jump from XP to Vista, because what I liked about 7 is
1293720	1297840	it takes the best parts of Vista, and what you remember liking about XP, kind of puts
1297840	1298840	it together.
1298840	1303040	The one thing I don't like about 7 is I cannot stand these administrator privileges things.
1303040	1305360	I want to freaking get them removed.
1305360	1306360	It's the one thing I didn't like.
1306360	1307360	It's in Vista too.
1307360	1310280	Yeah, I know, I didn't like it in Vista either.
1310280	1311780	There should be a way I can disable that crap.
1311780	1312780	You can disable it.
1312780	1313780	Can you?
1313780	1317180	Well, in Vista, all you have to do is make yourself full administrator and then just
1317180	1322840	do... it took me a while to change it, to find where to change it, but it is there.
1322840	1323840	They should be there.
1323840	1326560	To be fair, I haven't looked hard enough, and I'm sure our chat room is going to light
1326560	1329900	up with comments on things I could be doing better in a minute here, and I'll have to
1329900	1333120	look into that in the next week, but I was just having problems because it was not letting
1333120	1336840	me delete World of Warcraft folders because it said I didn't create them, and I had to
1336840	1341260	go in this really... like I had to right click on the folder, go into properties, make myself
1341260	1342260	the new owner.
1342260	1343260	It was ridiculous.
1343260	1345960	I should just be able to hit the delete key and nuke the fucking folder.
1345960	1349220	I should not have to jump hurdles to delete my own goddamn game.
1349220	1350220	You know?
1350220	1351220	It's stupid.
1351220	1352220	That's the one drawback.
1352220	1354720	Windows 7.
1354720	1357680	And to be fair, Vista has a lot of that administrator pain in the ass too.
1357680	1360960	So you know what?
1360960	1363880	Just run Linux Mint, Rob.
1363880	1365920	I'm not going to run Linux Mint on a desktop.
1365920	1370640	I'd run it on my laptop, but running that stuff on my desktop, I can't do it.
1370640	1373000	It will run more efficiently?
1373000	1374000	On a laptop?
1374000	1375000	No!
1375000	1376000	I can't.
1376000	1377000	It runs more efficiently?
1377000	1378000	Why don't you run it on your desktop then?
1378000	1379400	Because I actually have to have programs that use a Windows environment.
1379400	1382960	Well, I use a lot of movie makers and stuff like that that's Windows environment.
1382960	1385140	So you know, that's where I'm coming from.
1385140	1389240	You know, for a laptop though, like, you know, I kind of like...
1389240	1391020	Mint 8's out now.
1391020	1394640	You know, I know you're not a big fan of Google Chrome, but I like where that's headed as
1394640	1397000	far as a laptop OS goes.
1397000	1401920	That it's just the internet, the documents, you know, the stuff you want to do on the
1401920	1403920	go.
1403920	1408560	But I could never, like, God, Google Chrome, I could never run on a desktop.
1408560	1409560	Good lord.
1409560	1411400	I don't think that it's actually meant for desktop use though.
1411400	1412400	I don't think so either.
1412400	1416000	But Mint is fairly versatile.
1416000	1418800	In fact, actually the other thing that I was going to be doing with my computer when the
1418800	1425560	semester's over is actually doing a second install for Mint 8 because I was going to
1425560	1430920	run some of the Windows-emulated environments because apparently they actually run pretty
1430920	1436020	well using less system resource than Vista or Windows 7 does.
1436020	1440960	So actually all this 5 gigs of RAM I can actually use it for my graphics programs.
1440960	1444920	You know, I might give it a try.
1444920	1448000	I am not a fan of Windows.
1448000	1450300	I use it out of necessity.
1450300	1453240	And lately I've been even less of a fan of Mac OS.
1453240	1457520	Yeah, there's things I really, really like about the Mac and there's things I really,
1457520	1458840	really don't like about the Mac.
1458840	1459840	Me too.
1459840	1460840	I know where you're coming from.
1460840	1466160	Well it's one thing that I've actually been pretty happy that finally Adobe has gotten
1466160	1473080	their crap together and made CS4 actually really, really wonderfully compatible with
1473080	1474840	a PC environment.
1474840	1477200	You know, it's got everything optimized for your graphics cards.
1477200	1484080	I can run Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign and Corel Painter and the internet and AIM
1484080	1487560	and all this other crap at the same time without my system just farting.
1487560	1488560	Nice.
1488560	1489560	Alright.
1489560	1492920	And just another quick note because I see a lot of chatters saying that they're hearing
1492920	1493920	a lot of typing.
1493920	1497100	I think something's up with Jamie's mic tonight and it's more sensitive than usual which is
1497100	1500280	strange because we didn't change any of the dials but you know, things happen when things
1500280	1501340	get shifted around.
1501340	1503120	So I think it's just ultra-sensitive tonight.
1503120	1505520	And I've been typing on the microphone.
1505520	1506520	No.
1506520	1509560	So I'm just saying, we know you guys are hearing it, we just don't know why.
1509560	1514160	So one of the beauties of live radio is that sometimes we have to figure things out on
1514160	1515160	the fly.
1515160	1516160	It's the whole newsroom vibe, okay?
1516160	1517160	Yes.
1517160	1518160	It's the typewriter.
1518160	1521000	Live for the OLR newsroom.
1521000	1525160	Yeah, we just totally need to have the Morse code ticker going in the background.
1525160	1528000	Goodnight and have a pleasant tomorrow.
1528000	1535240	Anyhow, sorry, going back to games for Windows Live because damn, we got on a whole tangent
1535240	1536240	about Windows 7.
1536240	1540560	The point I was trying to get to earlier, I've been running Windows 7 for months now
1540560	1542120	and I haven't seen it.
1542120	1545520	There was the point I was trying to make seven minutes ago.
1545520	1551320	Anyway, the other thing I wanted to say, though, about this, Loki, I don't think you really
1551320	1552880	use any of this stuff.
1552880	1554440	Do you even have a Steam account?
1554440	1555440	Nope.
1555440	1558160	No, I figured, I figured.
1558160	1559160	Why would you have a Steam account?
1559160	1560160	Okay.
1560160	1561160	Why would I pay for software?
1561160	1562160	I don't know.
1562160	1564840	Craig, call it supporting developers, maybe?
1564840	1565840	I don't know.
1565840	1566840	Call me crazy.
1566840	1568400	Honestly, I don't play enough PC games to have that.
1568400	1569400	Fair enough.
1569400	1571520	The last game I bought, er, I didn't even really...
1571520	1574760	Final Fantasy XI is the last PC game I remember you, like, actually playing more than like
1574760	1575760	an hour of.
1575760	1578520	Uh, I played Crysis and Spore.
1578520	1579520	Okay.
1579520	1585360	Spore was, no, actually the last Games for Windows live game that I purchased was Grand
1585360	1587120	Theft Auto IV for the PC.
1587120	1588120	Oh, okay.
1588120	1593400	And I actually stopped playing that because I got tired of trying to monkey with stuff
1593400	1602760	to get it to, it, I don't know why games nowadays, some of them don't support, you know, multiple
1602760	1608400	graphics cards and it's really sad that they don't, cause I wasted all that money on another
1608400	1610920	graphics card for Crysis.
1610920	1612600	I mean, well, it looks good.
1612600	1615040	I told you about my Dragon Age issues, right?
1615040	1619000	Like, it just doesn't run well on my computer at all and I blame the video card, I think
1619000	1622440	my video card just isn't good enough, even though I bought what I thought was a gaming
1622440	1623440	computer.
1623440	1626040	I mean, it wasn't an Alienware or anything like that, which, god no, I'd never buy one
1626040	1627040	of those.
1627040	1628040	But, um...
1628040	1629680	You don't buy computers, you get, you build computers.
1629680	1632480	I, no, I should have built the god damn computer, but it was eight...
1632480	1636320	It was eight hundred dollars and I was like, oh, this is a great deal, it's got like six
1636320	1637320	gigs of RAM, dah, dah, dah.
1637320	1638320	I'm like, I can't build one that cheap.
1638320	1639320	Ah, it was stupid.
1639320	1640320	You can.
1640320	1642680	It was bad judgment, I admit it.
1642680	1646760	How dare I doubt the great and mighty Loki and I paid for it every day of my life.
1646760	1649840	I just built, well, lesson learned.
1649840	1657320	Now, I just built a PC for my mom, actually, it's sadly almost, well, not quite up to spec
1657320	1661640	to what mine is, cause mine was built for gaming, but, um, you know, three fifty.
1661640	1666400	You know, so you, it gets incredibly cheap to do it nowadays and if you actually go piece
1666400	1669880	by piece of what they actually include in there, you can see where they're cutting corners.
1669880	1674120	Well, I need a new video card, because Dragon Age kind of runs like balls on my computer,
1674120	1678120	but then I watched my friend play it on his computer this weekend and it's like, oh, beautiful.
1678120	1682160	And you can do rotating and things that you can't do on the console, so I'm like, I must
1682160	1686960	play Dragon Age, this game is beautiful, and I can't, cause my video card is balls, cause
1686960	1687960	I didn't trust Loki.
1687960	1688960	Anyhow.
1688960	1692640	Well, that'd be the last time that you'd do that.
1692640	1695440	Well, clearly there's not a lot of good news this week.
1695440	1699320	One of our favorite people in the video game industry, one of our very favorite people,
1699320	1704080	and I don't think Jamie or Loki would disagree with me here, Akira Yamaoka.
1704080	1709360	Akira Yamaoka, of course, the producer of Silent Hill, also for long time Bamani fans,
1709360	1712840	he's been a composer for songs in the series for years and years.
1712840	1714760	He has left Konami.
1714760	1718520	After a sixteen year relationship with Konami, he has left.
1718520	1726000	And no word as to why, of course, but I gotta be honest, without him at Konami, Silent Hill's
1726000	1727000	dead to me.
1727000	1732320	I mean, I don't see how they could do another Silent Hill game without his soundtracks.
1732320	1738220	They'll probably try, just like they outsourced it, or not outsourced it, but had a US developer
1738220	1741520	do Homecoming or what have you, and I don't know, maybe that's part of what ticked him
1741520	1742520	off.
1742520	1743520	I have no idea.
1743520	1744520	Or maybe, you know, after sixteen years you want a new job.
1744520	1746760	That he just doesn't get along with people, from what I understand.
1746760	1747760	Really?
1747760	1750920	He was nice, he was nice at E3 that one year we randomly met him.
1750920	1755120	Yeah, he was pretty cool, and I mean, I was like, hahaha!
1755120	1763640	But anyway, but seriously, I just, I, you know, maybe he just got tired of dealing with
1763640	1765440	all the crap going on.
1765440	1768600	And we don't know, we can speculate until the cows come home, but we don't know.
1768600	1770120	There's been no official statement made.
1770120	1773600	But you also look at it and go, okay, he was there for what, sixteen years?
1773600	1776320	I mean, that's a long time to be at any job.
1776320	1778360	And you know, sometimes people just want to change.
1778360	1782440	Maybe he's doing that whole thing where it's like, okay, I've been with this band and now
1782440	1784920	I want to split off and make a solo album.
1784920	1788860	You know, and kind of secretly, that's what I hope happens, is that he goes off and makes
1788860	1793840	a new studio and maybe makes a new Silent Hill-esque kind of game, because I would be
1793840	1798840	all over that, because Akira Yamoko is a great, great composer, and just, not just the Silent
1798840	1803080	Hill works, but a lot of the stuff he contributed to, BeatMania, 2DX, and DDR over the years
1803080	1804760	was fantastic.
1804760	1807320	And he scored things even all the way back to the 8-bit days.
1807320	1811920	I know he did the Contra game that was on, he did some of Super Contra's soundtrack,
1811920	1812920	I think.
1812920	1814160	He's just done a lot of stuff over the years.
1814160	1817120	I'm sure the wiki has the whole list about that.
1817120	1818840	So, we wish him the best!
1818840	1823840	Good luck to Akira Yamoko, and again, we would really like to see you form a new studio and
1823840	1825000	make some more scary games.
1825000	1826600	He should hire me.
1826600	1827600	He should.
1827600	1828600	He should.
1828600	1829600	He should hire me, too.
1829600	1834200	I am particularly crazy enough to be able to help with the whole Silent Hill... anyway.
1834200	1837040	You just want to be raped by Pyramid Head.
1837040	1838680	No!
1838680	1840440	No!
1840440	1844360	Not just no, but no!
1844360	1845720	Ew!
1845720	1850200	One does not just ask Pyramid Head to rape them.
1850200	1851200	Besides that, he has-
1851200	1852640	You have to be chosen by Pyramid Head.
1852640	1855720	Besides that, he only bones the monsters.
1855720	1857760	Ah, I see.
1857760	1860320	I'm not a nurse, sorry.
1860320	1864440	Well, how about some game banning... or not?
1864440	1865440	This is stupid.
1865440	1872320	Um, yeah, so the Australian classification board says that Sega can't have it for aliens
1872320	1875600	versus predators, so that means that they actually cannot sell it in Australia the way
1875600	1876600	it is now.
1876600	1884200	That, um, it's... they're saying that because you've got human beings being tortured and
1884200	1892440	violated and decapitated and dismembered and lots of stabbing through different parts of
1892440	1895440	the body that, um, that no.
1895440	1896620	They said no.
1896620	1902280	And Sega Australia is like, um, we're gonna still appeal it, because this is kind of stupid.
1902280	1905680	Well, and that's just what you do when your game gets a bad rating.
1905680	1909720	I mean, have we ever heard a game company ever in the history of this show, you know,
1909720	1915520	this is why game gets banned, and the company says, ah, okay, well, you know, these things
1915520	1916520	happen.
1916520	1917520	Well, we tried.
1917520	1918520	That's right.
1918520	1919520	Nope, cancel it, you know.
1919520	1920520	Merry Christmas to you now.
1920520	1921520	Oh well.
1921520	1922520	Oh well.
1922520	1923520	Happy Christmas.
1923520	1931120	Well, for example, um, you know, they could edit it, but since Germany had, um, problems
1931120	1937480	with AVP that, um, they actually decided not to release it in Germany, so that they wouldn't
1937480	1942380	have to, uh, compromise the, uh, integrity of the game.
1942380	1944440	That's a ballsy thing to do.
1944440	1945640	Yeah.
1945640	1949200	You know, one thing I, uh, got to see this week was the Left 4 Dead, you know, it's on
1949200	1950200	YouTube.
1950200	1954600	If you go look for the Left 4 Dead 2, you can look at the censored version in Australia
1954600	1959800	and kind of compare it to the regular one, and, man, you guys in Australia got shafted
1959800	1964040	on Left 4 Dead 2, it's, it's, like, the zombies, like, disappear.
1964040	1967800	Like I was waiting for the bodies to flicker before they disappear like it was Double Dragon
1967800	1968800	or something.
1968800	1973560	I mean, it was, it was not pleasant how desanitized they had to make that game.
1973560	1974560	It's, it's unfortunate.
1974560	1975620	So do you still want to...
1975620	1979880	It's like, the dingo ate my decapitated, decapitation scenes, you know, it's sad.
1979880	1981440	Do you still want to go over there?
1981440	1982440	What, to Australia?
1982440	1983440	Yeah.
1983440	1984440	Well, I want to go visit.
1984440	1985440	But you don't want to live there.
1985440	1988960	That's because I have an unhealthy obsession with a lot of Australian movies over the years,
1988960	1993440	but, you know, and I want, I want to see somebody play a didgeridoo.
1993440	1996240	Did I tell you I saw someone play a didgeridoo at school?
1996240	1998040	It's not authentic if it's not in Australia.
1998040	1999040	No.
1999040	2000040	But he...
2000040	2002200	Just like if you have a pineapple here, it's not the same as having a pineapple in Hawaii.
2002200	2003200	I'm sorry.
2003200	2006560	But he, he built it out of PVC pipe.
2006560	2007560	That's not a didgeridoo!
2007560	2008560	That's...
2008560	2011720	But it sounded, it sounded right, and the guy was sitting outside at school...
2011720	2013720	That's a PVCeridoo or something.
2013720	2014720	Playing a PV...
2014720	2015720	PVCeridoo.
2015720	2016720	Didgeridoo.
2016720	2019720	I took a picture of it, too.
2019720	2021720	It was funny.
2021720	2026760	Well, look, people, you know what, if this game comes out on PC, which almost all these
2026760	2031040	games do nowadays, what's going to stop them from just importing the PC version of the
2031040	2032040	game?
2032040	2034160	I mean, they don't, do they region lockout PC games?
2034160	2036160	I don't think that's a very easy thing to do.
2036160	2037160	No, you can't.
2037160	2038160	You can't, really.
2038160	2039160	There is no regions.
2039160	2040160	You can if it runs on a DVD.
2040160	2042480	Oh, I guess that makes sense.
2042480	2043480	But isn't Australia?
2043480	2044480	That's a...
2044480	2046400	Australia's on the same region as Britain, though, right?
2046400	2047400	You can't, no.
2047400	2053240	If it's on DVD, DVD video only has regions, DVD software does not have regions at all.
2053240	2056240	So there's no way to lockout anything.
2056240	2059880	I guess maybe because we're thinking PS2 would do the region lockouts, but of course that's
2059880	2060880	different.
2060880	2061880	Interesting.
2061880	2068080	Yeah, and even if they did, it would just get bypassed so easy it's not even worth it.
2068080	2071320	Somebody in the chatroom, of course, made the reference to Didgeridoo Techno.
2071320	2074880	I was an inside joke on this show from a year and a half ago, but maybe we'll have to play
2074880	2076320	that on break tonight.
2076320	2077320	It's been a little while.
2077320	2078720	Don't forget the references to Kylie.
2078720	2080120	We haven't had Didgeridoo Techno in a while.
2080120	2081840	You should play some Kylie during the break.
2081840	2082840	We'll see.
2082840	2083840	I have...
2083840	2087560	Well, I had an old school chiptune song all picked out, but we'll see.
2087560	2088560	We'll see.
2088560	2091080	Anyhow, we gotta move on with more news.
2091080	2098120	Sorry Australia, you should write your legislators and tell them they're crap.
2098120	2099660	I don't really know what else you can do.
2099660	2100660	These are your elected officials.
2100660	2101660	There he is.
2101660	2102660	Someone actually put a...
2102660	2107400	I swear, someone had to do some hunting to go through my Twitter.
2107400	2109240	Wait, wait, wait.
2109240	2113840	Did somebody dig up the PVC redo and post it in our chatroom?
2113840	2116640	That's the picture that I posted on Twitter.
2116640	2117640	I'm kind of...
2117640	2118640	The OL Army knows how to stop.
2118640	2120900	That I took out of the window of my car.
2120900	2123520	So you see that blue light over there in that building?
2123520	2124920	There's the ARC Art Department.
2124920	2125920	Ew.
2125920	2126920	I wouldn't tell them that.
2126920	2127920	One of these days...
2127920	2129200	Give them money.
2129200	2132680	Tigerclaw's gonna show up there.
2132680	2133680	Just messin'.
2133680	2135680	Alright, sorry Logie.
2135680	2136680	Yes.
2136680	2144560	So there's a rumor that by the end of the year actually, or I guess near future, you're
2144560	2150120	gonna be able to play your PSP minis on your PlayStation 3.
2150120	2153080	So there's basically kind of...
2153080	2154960	I don't know, you can look at it two ways.
2154960	2161920	One, they're allowing more customers to purchase these PSP minis, which is neat that they would
2161920	2164200	allow you to be able to play it.
2164200	2169200	Two, they don't have very much confidence in the PlayStation Portable platform in order
2169200	2173480	to put out these PSP minis.
2173480	2175900	They are afraid that they're not gonna sell that well.
2175900	2179920	So I don't know, I think it's good that they'll have more content on the PlayStation Network
2179920	2185920	because it's kind of bare sometimes as far as new stuff goes.
2185920	2189480	Now why do you think that the PSP minis are a failure?
2189480	2190480	So far.
2190480	2191480	I guess I shouldn't...
2191480	2197000	Maybe failure is a strong word, but why do you think the PSP minis are not up to expectations
2197000	2199320	right now?
2199320	2204680	Maybe because the PlayStation Portable, I mean, the PSP goes, I mean, obviously you're
2204680	2206700	all digital.
2206700	2213120	Most people with PSPs probably aren't really interested in download games, whereas they're
2213120	2216720	more interested in kind of the retail stuff, because that way if they don't like it, they
2216720	2222760	can send it back, or they can rent it, or they can try it out, and that kind of stuff.
2222760	2229080	And maybe just some of these games like, you know, Tetris they put out there, I mean, who
2229080	2230880	hasn't played Tetris, and really do...
2230880	2235040	Okay, let me, here's one reason why the PSP minis, here's my proof on why the PSP minis
2235040	2236040	is doing well.
2236040	2237480	Here's the game you can play along with at home.
2237480	2238480	You ready?
2238480	2239480	Okay.
2239480	2240480	Quick.
2240480	2243360	Name one PSP minigame that's been released that wasn't Sudoku Tetris.
2243360	2244360	Ready?
2244360	2245360	Go!
2245360	2246360	I don't know!
2246360	2247360	Oh!
2247360	2252240	That's why they're not doing well, because there's nothing of note!
2252240	2256120	I'm sure there are, but I just don't know what they are, and they don't advertise them
2256120	2257360	very well either.
2257360	2258360	Bingo.
2258360	2265800	I've seen more advertisement for the XNA lacrosse game than I have for these PSP minis.
2265800	2270560	I've got to mention this that's come up in our chat, because it's not on the show roll
2270560	2273200	tonight, but it's something I have to bring up, because I really want to hear what Loki
2273200	2274440	has to say to this.
2274440	2279040	SalaciousPopInChat says, there was some sort of Logitech rumor this week about them considering
2279040	2283200	making a UMD add-on for the go.
2283200	2284760	And they already denied it.
2284760	2285760	Have they denied it?
2285760	2286760	Yeah.
2286760	2292080	But let's imagine, let's go to the land of make-believe, okay, with King Friday and everybody
2292080	2296400	for a minute, and imagine that this rumor were true.
2296400	2297400	What would you be saying?
2297400	2300840	That's the most retarded thing I've ever heard.
2300840	2307240	Yes, let me buy a more expensive system that's like almost $100 more expensive than the actual
2307240	2312440	normal system, which includes this peripheral, and then buy an additional peripheral to be
2312440	2316360	able to have the same features as the cheaper system.
2316360	2320120	So you're asking me to spend more money for the system initially, and more money on top
2320120	2323520	of that to buy a feature that should have been in there in the first place.
2323520	2325320	Sure, sign me up.
2325320	2326320	But yes.
2326320	2332240	My reply to that would be, but meow meow this.
2332240	2333600	I see what you did there.
2333600	2334600	Yes, you did.
2334600	2336920	And like half of our listeners aren't even going to get it because they didn't watch
2336920	2337920	Mr. Roger's Neighborhood.
2337920	2338920	No, plenty more.
2338920	2341720	Not going to understand what you just did, but I laughed very hard.
2341720	2342720	All right.
2342720	2343720	Rob, that was for your benefit.
2343720	2344720	Thank you.
2344720	2345720	I appreciate it.
2345720	2346720	And Rob, I think that's so meow meow stupid.
2346720	2349840	I think this show should simply exist to amuse me.
2349840	2350840	Otherwise what the hell are we doing?
2350840	2351840	Exactly.
2351840	2352840	We're just wasting our goddamn time.
2352840	2355560	We do this show every week so you can bring me coffee.
2355560	2364320	I was hoping that Logitech rumor was true, because it would just be the nice bullet point
2364320	2367040	to the failure of the PSB Go.
2367040	2372320	And there's the ribbon for the package of failure right there.
2372320	2376800	And that's what they should call the add-on, Logitech Package of Failure for the PSB Go.
2376800	2381840	Well, you already spent the money already, so apparently you're going to buy extra crap
2381840	2382840	for it as well.
2382840	2383840	Sure, why not?
2383840	2384840	Meow meow fail.
2384840	2389800	You know what, there's actually, I just realized, there's a UMD movie I have that I do not have
2389800	2391400	on DVD otherwise.
2391400	2392400	Shallon Soccer.
2392400	2393400	No, it's good.
2393400	2399800	I didn't know how to respond to that, what do you want me to say?
2399800	2404680	So that means that I actually would have a reason to have a UMD add-on, except that I
2404680	2408040	have an old PSP and didn't bother buying the damn Go.
2408040	2413800	Or you could just, I don't know, give up on the UMD format as a format for movies, since
2413800	2416400	they've stopped making them anyways.
2416400	2422080	I don't know, I never really saw any reason to, because I already have that on laserdiscs
2422080	2423080	somewhere.
2423080	2425600	And you know what, you know why the PSP Minis suck?
2425600	2429160	It's because they've already had the PSP download games already.
2429160	2433920	There was absolutely no need to add PSP Minis as another form of download game.
2433920	2437040	Well I like the idea of cheaper games, just so we don't have anything of note.
2437040	2442400	Now to be fair, Sony needs time to grow.
2442400	2446400	It's not a chia pet, it doesn't grow in seven days, it's a little more of a redwood tree
2446400	2449320	that takes hundreds of years to grow to its full potential.
2449320	2451540	That's what Sony is right now.
2451540	2455040	I think in about a year's time we'll have those PSP Minis that are worth it and we'll
2455040	2458000	be liking it a lot more because they're like, ooh, cheap games that are notable.
2458000	2462300	But right now, I got nothing.
2462300	2464640	You know, there's just nothing very of note.
2464640	2471400	And I do feel bad for the Sony fan, well no I don't, but you know, we habitually bash
2471400	2477520	the PSP Go on this show, but honestly, Sony, it's just time to give the PSP Go an abortion.
2477520	2481600	I realize it's already out of the womb, but just stuff it in the face with a pillow and
2481600	2483340	end the PSP Go.
2483340	2484760	Because the PSP is a great system.
2484760	2490880	Go back to the 3,000, it's great, PSP is great, it's internet, MP3s, movies, all right there,
2490880	2491880	it's great.
2491880	2493440	Stop it with the Go.
2493440	2494440	Stop it.
2494440	2499480	And it wouldn't have been that hard to, I mean seriously, all they would've had to do
2499480	2504520	is make a PSP 4,000 or whatever and have internal storage built into it.
2504520	2511160	So okay, look, we've got an internal drive and all the same features that you liked before.
2511160	2512160	And that would've been just fine.
2512160	2514820	Brad from Pop Culture asked an interesting question in chat.
2514820	2518960	How is the add-on any different than a cart adapter for the GameCube or SNES?
2518960	2522920	Well, in both those cases, you were taking portable systems and putting them on your
2522920	2523960	TV.
2523960	2526080	And I think that was the point of those.
2526080	2532260	Whereas this Logitech adapter is taking something that they took away and putting it back because
2532260	2536000	you realized it never should've been gone in the first place, if that makes any sense.
2536000	2537000	I don't know.
2537000	2538000	It's sort of like...
2538000	2539000	I think that's the difference to me.
2539000	2543280	And to be fair, those other adapters on the GameCube were a little silly as well, although
2543280	2549680	the Super Game Boy did let you tweak the colors, silly, superficial things that weren't there
2549680	2550680	to begin with.
2550680	2553520	At least something.
2553520	2554520	But at least...
2554520	2556320	I don't know.
2556320	2563360	It's sort of like the HD DVD add-on to the Xbox 360.
2563360	2567640	Something that they could've put in at launch, but they didn't.
2567640	2569840	And no one's missing it now.
2569840	2570840	We'll see.
2570840	2575240	I mean, maybe, again, in a year's time, we'll be singing a different tune, but I still think
2575240	2576480	the PSP Go by that time will be...
2576480	2578760	I think if they'd literally put this out...
2578760	2582080	First off, it would've been Sony putting this out, not Logitech.
2582080	2586360	Although I can see why they do Logitech, so that way they wouldn't look as bad.
2586360	2588400	It would still be bad enough.
2588400	2592080	And right there, it's just like, oh, look, you don't have confidence in your system.
2592080	2594560	And how the hell would they manage to hack that?
2594560	2600540	And let's just say, for argument's sake, they were able to, I don't know, make that
2600540	2604880	device and have it connect to their memory card slot or something like that to read UMDs.
2604880	2611120	It would be hacked in seconds, and it would be a big old back door to the whole PSP Go.
2611120	2618360	It's not gonna end up pretty for them, which is why they need to do it, so that people
2618360	2620720	can hack the Go even easier.
2620720	2623240	All right, let's move on, guys.
2623240	2627520	We gotta keep moving on with the gaming news so we can get to a break here at some point.
2627520	2630360	And we're gonna move on to Xbox Live Arcade, looking at what's going on with Microsoft
2630360	2631360	a little bit.
2631360	2635400	It looks like the new game that will be coming out this week, Kix++, because it's coming
2635400	2640320	out on December 9th in Japan, can't imagine that it would be much further behind here.
2640320	2642120	If you've never played Kix before, it's pretty cool.
2642120	2646320	I wanna say Dark Sakura had it as their game of the week once, maybe like a year ago.
2646320	2648480	I am sure I did, because I love Kix.
2648480	2649480	I do too.
2649480	2651320	It's one of my favorite puzzler games.
2651320	2654160	And if you haven't played this, well, you've probably played Gals Panic, and it's pretty
2654160	2655480	much the same thing.
2655480	2659120	But if, for whatever reason, you somehow still have not played either one, then it's like
2659120	2661460	Miss Nude World 96.
2661460	2665360	And if you haven't played any of those, you draw these little lines and make boxes, and
2665360	2667520	you're trying to fill a certain percentage of the screen.
2667520	2670720	I know this game's been cloned several times, you've probably seen something like it.
2670720	2674840	So it's no surprise that a version of this will be coming to Xbox Live Arcade.
2674840	2675840	I don't know if it...
2675840	2679720	You know, all I've seen of this is a screenshot, so I don't know if it has, like...
2679720	2681880	Although it looks a little...
2681880	2686480	It looks a little Q Entertainment-y, meaning that it looks like it might have, like, flashing
2686480	2688560	lights and techno music and all that stuff.
2688560	2693480	I have no idea what to expect, but apparently it's coming out December 9th in Japan at 800
2693480	2694480	Microsoft points.
2694480	2696960	A release here honestly cannot be that far behind.
2696960	2702280	We might even be getting it at the same time, who knows yet, but most certainly before Christmas.
2702280	2706600	And I know Jamie's probably all over that, assuming it doesn't suck.
2706600	2707600	Although it looks like...
2707600	2708600	It looks like it might be fun.
2708600	2710000	It looks like it's, like, four players.
2710000	2711700	That could be kind of chaotic.
2711700	2714400	If four players are going at the grid all at once, that could be interesting.
2714400	2715400	That could be.
2715400	2716400	To see how...
2716400	2719720	Probably it's a big thing, it probably has, like, online, everybody kind of attacks it
2719720	2720720	all at once.
2720720	2722880	It could be cool.
2722880	2727600	Well, how about something that we kind of already knew?
2727600	2728600	Hmm.
2728600	2729600	Yeah.
2729600	2734000	So, you know the rumor was going along for a long time that a lot of the music in Sonic
2734000	2738160	3 had been done by Michael Jackson?
2738160	2743880	Yes, I've heard that rumor before, because the credits music sounds like Stranger in
2743880	2744880	Moscow, right?
2744880	2746200	And Casino Night from Scream?
2746200	2747200	Mm-hmm.
2747200	2748200	The same...
2748200	2749200	Ah, that's right.
2749200	2750200	Yeah.
2750200	2751200	The little triplet part.
2751200	2752200	But anyway, yeah.
2752200	2756280	So it was confirmed that he did it, but he was not happy with it, so he wanted himself
2756280	2758400	uncredited in the music altered.
2758400	2759400	Mm-hmm.
2759400	2763920	So, but he, of course, kept a lot of the same elements to use in his own music.
2763920	2767360	That's kind of a bummer for Sega, because imagine if they could have marketed that Sonic
2767360	2770080	3 had a Michael freaking Jackson soundtrack.
2770080	2772160	I mean, that would have been huge for them.
2772160	2777000	I mean, it's not like Sonic 3 was a little game anyway, but there'd be a lot of people
2777000	2779760	that would have taken a huge interest in this game, knowing that Michael Jackson had been
2779760	2780760	involved.
2780760	2787400	But there's also, I actually remembered there being interviews ahead of time that they said
2787400	2793040	that they were getting Michael Jackson's involvement for the musical direction on one of the games.
2793040	2794040	Mm-hmm.
2794040	2799560	And, because, I mean, that was in a magazine back when.
2799560	2808880	But the whole point was that, and this is a quote from, actually an interview with Michael
2808880	2814960	Jackson's composer, Brad Buxer, saying that at the time, this is a quote, at the time
2814960	2821120	game consoles did not allow optimal sound reproduction, and Michael found it frustrating.
2821120	2824120	He did not want to be associated with a product that devalued his music.
2824120	2827640	So what about Moonwalker, huh?
2827640	2831040	Well, Moonwalker was kind of a rat in the arcades.
2831040	2835480	I mean, at the time, now you look back and you go, this is something better left in my
2835480	2836480	memory.
2836480	2837480	It came out on Genesis?
2837480	2838480	That's true.
2838480	2841240	I thought a pretty good rendition of Smooth Criminal.
2841240	2843200	Now, Salacious Pop was thinking what I was thinking.
2843200	2846000	At least there's always Space Channel 5 with Space Michael, right?
2846000	2847000	Space Channel 5.
2847000	2848000	Mm-hmm.
2848000	2850080	By the way, have you ever heard this, and I think this is the right YouTube.
2850080	2852440	I came across this earlier this week when I was reading about the story.
2852440	2854240	I've actually got one that I can link you.
2854240	2855240	Do you?
2855240	2856240	Okay.
2856240	2860280	This is a hybrid one that's actually the credits and Michael Jackson's Stranger in Moscow over
2860280	2861280	each other.
2861280	2862280	I'll play a little clip of this here.
2862280	2880160	Yes, I have heard that.
2880160	2885000	By the way, I do think the Sonic 3 credit music is some of the best video game music
2885000	2886000	from that era.
2886000	2891080	So, it is pretty neat to know that Michael Jackson indeed had something to do with that.
2891080	2895240	So, oh yeah, the Ice Cap Zone thing, huh?
2895240	2896240	I'm gonna link it to you right now.
2896240	2902000	All right, let's try to get this played here and then we'll move on with another story.
2902000	2906800	In fact, while I load that up, maybe we'll start moving into release dates this week.
2906800	2910560	Loki, why don't you start off with the US releases and then we'll come back to this.
2910560	2913320	This week's not a lot coming out.
2913320	2919560	Pretty much your big game's gonna be The Saboteur coming out on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and
2919560	2921520	PC.
2921520	2927400	Also this week, though, we do have one, I guess, well, apparently now one of the last
2927400	2932180	Akira Yamaka Silent Hill games, Silent Hill Shattered Memories coming out on the Wii this
2932180	2934180	week.
2934180	2935880	I have to pick that up.
2935880	2937080	I really like that at E3.
2937080	2938080	I hope it doesn't disappoint.
2938080	2941040	No, it looks freaking awesome, so, you know.
2941040	2943240	Yeah, well, Nintendogs looked awesome, too.
2943240	2944240	That's all I'm saying.
2944240	2948600	Yeah, but Nintendogs was awesome, it's just, unfortunately, we didn't get to play it longer
2948600	2954400	than five minutes at, you know, E3, so, eh, you know, we thought it was good for longer
2954400	2957680	than five, but, really, it was only good for five.
2957680	2964840	Of course, this week, Legend of Zelda Spirit Tracks on the DS, and then there's some small
2964840	2967920	crap that's kind of littering the rest of the week.
2967920	2977600	Wreck Room for the Wii, Puzzler World for the DS, which is a puzzle minigame compilation,
2977600	2982800	James Cameron's Avatar the Game, out on PSP, because I believe it's delayed from the rest
2982800	2990440	of them, and that's about it, actually.
2990440	2994800	Alright, let me go back to those YouTubes real quick before I get into the Japanese
2994800	2995800	releases.
2995800	2999840	Maybe, who is it mixed with Ice Cap Zone music?
2999840	3000840	Yeah.
3000840	3005040	Oops, I still have my wave muted.
3005040	3007040	Live radio fail.
3007040	3020440	Something's out of tune with that.
3020440	3022160	I think they were just doing it to sync it.
3022160	3024120	They need Timbaland to get it auto-tuned.
3024120	3025560	That's what they need, and then it would be fine.
3025560	3027000	They were syncing it.
3027000	3028000	That's the whole thing.
3028000	3029000	I get it.
3029000	3030000	Alright.
3030000	3031000	I know it was jam, not scream.
3031000	3036000	Jam mixed with Carnival Night Zone.
3036000	3047480	Dude, I like this.
3047480	3050920	It's kind of neat.
3050920	3053880	It's so cool now that that game just has so much added value.
3053880	3056680	Even though this is one of those things everybody always suspected anyway, but I think a lot
3056680	3060840	of people were like, did Michael Jackson rip off Sonic because it was one of his favorite
3060840	3061840	movies?
3061840	3062840	But now it's like, no.
3062840	3063840	He fucking wrote it.
3063840	3065920	He just took the stuff he already did.
3065920	3066920	Yeah.
3066920	3067920	I think it's amazing.
3067920	3071360	A couple more things I was going to mention real quick for release dates, even though
3071360	3076520	it's not next week, but there's a couple of the Konami Classic volumes that are coming
3076520	3082840	out on Xbox 360 for 20 bucks each, and actually there's a couple that are pretty good deals.
3082840	3086240	The first one is... Are these just like the live arcade games?
3086240	3087240	These are live arcade games.
3087240	3088240	Like what PopCap does.
3088240	3089240	That's pretty sweet.
3089240	3092880	They've got Castlevania, Symphony of the Night, Frogger, and Super Contra.
3092880	3093880	That's for 20 bucks.
3093880	3099760	The other one that they have is Track and Field, Rush and Attack, and Contra.
3099760	3102560	Rush and Attack, by the way, I bet is one of those arcade games you probably didn't
3102560	3103560	play growing up.
3103560	3106900	At least I didn't, but it was actually a lot of fun on Xbox Live Arcade.
3106900	3107900	For five bucks.
3107900	3108900	It wasn't a bad deal.
3108900	3109900	Anyhow.
3109900	3111080	So that's what they're available for now.
3111080	3114680	I'm not sure if they've dropped the price enough to where that's actually not a good
3114680	3117800	deal anymore, but maybe three games for 20 bucks.
3117800	3120040	Let's go to Japan and look at the releases over there.
3120040	3123280	Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 gets released in Japan this week, obviously.
3123280	3126320	Not quite as big of a deal there as it was here, but certainly the game is going to have
3126320	3128360	its fans over there, just like it does here.
3128360	3132040	That is coming out on the Xbox 360 this week in Japan, and they're even getting their own
3132040	3135800	Xbox 360 Elite version of it, just like we had here.
3135800	3138600	Samurai Spirits Zen comes out on the 360 as well.
3138600	3142600	If I'm not mistaken, Samurai Spirits is Samurai Shodown over here, correct?
3142600	3146960	So yeah, it's from SNK, so that is getting released on the 360 this week.
3146960	3149280	Some fighting game fans are going to be very happy about that.
3149280	3152060	I know that series has its fans.
3152060	3157760	Also on PlayStation 3, Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 is out over there as well, as well
3157760	3160800	as X-Edge or Cross Edge.
3160800	3165320	Of course, next week is Final Fantasy 13, and I know a lot of you over here in America
3165320	3168600	are going to be importing that, although if you just wait 4 more months, you'll have it
3168600	3170240	here soon enough.
3170240	3175600	Coming out on the Nintendo Wii, Tales of Graces, and it's also, I guess, a big enough game
3175600	3180820	where it's getting a bundle release as well, because it's a Tales of game, but now it's
3180820	3181820	on the Wii.
3181820	3184840	Like, you know, Tales of Symphonia and all these other titles, now it's Tales of Graces
3184840	3186800	coming out on the Wii this week in Japan.
3186800	3190760	Also Toushinden coming out in Japan this week as well.
3190760	3191760	On the Nintendo Wii.
3191760	3192760	No way.
3192760	3193760	Way.
3193760	3198840	Man, I remember playing Toushinden 3 on PlayStation.
3198840	3199840	There it is.
3199840	3200840	Now you get a version on the Nintendo Wii.
3200840	3203200	I don't know if it's a ported version of the game or what it is.
3203200	3204200	Oh no, it's a redo.
3204200	3207320	Actually, you know, I remembered seeing the trailer for it.
3207320	3208320	Yeah?
3208320	3209960	Yeah, and it looked just as crappy as all the other ones, which means I have to play
3209960	3210960	it.
3210960	3214520	Um, PlayStation 2, you know, the releases are dying down over there in Japan just like
3214520	3218520	they are over here, but I do want to point out World Soccer winning 11 2010 is coming
3218520	3220680	out in Japan for you soccer fans.
3220680	3228560	Nintendo DS, Luminous Arc 3 comes out on the DS this week, and lastly on the PSP, Bleach
3228560	3234600	Soul Carnival 2 makes its way out in Japan as well as yet another Naruto game, Naruto
3234600	3239200	Shippuden Narutamit Excel 3.
3239200	3240200	And World Soccer winning 11.
3240200	3241200	Woohoo.
3241200	3242200	On PSP.
3242200	3243680	There you have it for Japanese releases.
3243680	3248000	Well, we've got just a few notable ones for the UK.
3248000	3253920	On the 10th, Pixel Junk Shooter on PlayStation 3, and then on the 11th we have Tekken 6 on
3253920	3258720	PSP and The Legend of Zelda Spirit Tracks on DS.
3258720	3259720	Very cool.
3259720	3264680	All right, so, back to some more gaming news then, and then we're going to get into the
3264680	3268400	Classic Game of the Week before too long here, and of course our Part B in just a little
3268400	3269400	while.
3269400	3270400	Mm-hmm.
3270400	3273480	Um, this is kind of cool.
3273480	3279560	They've got, you may remember we talked a little bit about this before, kind of the
3279560	3285760	whole play, create, share games that they've got now on the PlayStation 3.
3285760	3290760	Well, the second one in the series is ModNation Racers, and of course it's kind of like Build
3290760	3296600	Your Own Mario Kart type game, but they are, just like they did with LittleBigPlanet, they're
3296600	3301600	going to be having a beta, and it actually starts this month, and there's a few ways
3301600	3303660	you could be in that beta.
3303660	3306680	One is of course if you bought- Blowing someone at Sony.
3306680	3307680	That's one way you can do it.
3307680	3309360	That might, that might work.
3309360	3312720	One is if you bought the LittleBigPlanet Game of the Year Edition, which have a code that
3312720	3319120	came inside the box, and then of course you can also sign up online for a chance to participate
3319120	3326500	as well, and that of course can be done at us.playstation.com slash ModNation slash online
3326500	3331240	beta, and you can go ahead and sign up there.
3331240	3337000	Also you can be an existing subscriber to CORE, or subscribe on or before December 15th,
3337000	3343840	receive a voucher as well, and you can check out the pretty awesome game, which still no
3343840	3348580	one has announced that it's going to be on PSP, but it is going to be on PSP.
3348580	3350360	You heard it here first.
3350360	3353840	Well, it also doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure that out.
3353840	3354840	Of course.
3354840	3360080	I mean, to be fair, but it would be nice to have that confirmed by Sony at some point,
3360080	3363240	but you know, someday they'll decide to say it, and it'll be a big surprise, except not
3363240	3364240	really.
3364240	3366040	But I'm actually very much looking forward to ModNation's Racer.
3366040	3370240	I think this does look like another game that's going to be like a must-have on the PS3, so
3370240	3373960	I'm very excited to see that.
3373960	3374960	So we'll see.
3374960	3375960	Yeah.
3375960	3376960	I was just reading in chat.
3376960	3377960	What's that?
3377960	3383000	Bond 006 said, I think the gay marriage bill was just passed here in New York.
3383000	3384000	On a Sunday night?
3384000	3385000	Well, I...
3385000	3386000	Well, checking the news.
3386000	3393200	Yeah, I was going to say, careful, there was one that failed a couple days ago in the New
3393200	3397000	York Senate, I think it was.
3397000	3398000	So...
3398000	3399000	Let us know as you find out.
3399000	3400000	Yeah.
3400000	3401000	I'd be curious, too.
3401000	3403000	You know, it'll be about time.
3403000	3406000	I mean, live in the now, people.
3406000	3407000	Yeah.
3407000	3408000	All right.
3408000	3414000	Also, coming to the now, which I'm very excited about, Sunsoft, rise from your grave.
3414000	3418080	Okay, I mean, that wasn't a Sunsoft game, but still, you might remember Sunsoft.
3418080	3422160	They made some cool 8-bit games back in the day, one of which, of course, near and dear
3422160	3424320	to all of our hearts, Fester's Quest.
3424320	3425640	No, I'm kidding.
3425640	3426640	Blaster Master.
3426640	3428120	Well, Fester's Quest wasn't that bad.
3428120	3429880	But Blaster Master was made by Sunsoft.
3429880	3431560	Yeah, it wasn't that bad.
3431560	3433480	For me to poop on.
3433480	3438200	Hey, I got that game for Christmas, one Christmas, and I played it for like a week straight.
3438200	3440200	It wasn't terrible, except it was very strange.
3440200	3444560	Like, aliens land in the Addams Family back, forget it.
3444560	3446280	Blaster Master, fuck everything else.
3446280	3447720	You have Blaster Master.
3447720	3449280	Who cares what else Sunsoft did?
3449280	3451060	They did Blaster Master.
3451060	3455160	And sure enough, that is the first thing they are planning to release now on the NES Virtual
3455160	3457600	Console, is Blaster Master.
3457600	3462000	Unfortunately, it's not like a WiiWare souped-up version or anything like that, but the Wii
3462000	3466480	Virtual Console release of Blaster Master, 500 Wii points, apparently coming out this
3466480	3467840	month.
3467840	3471680	By the way, the whole reason this is happening is because Sunsoft is actually resuming operations
3471680	3472680	in North America.
3472680	3475960	They're having a little help from a company called Gaijin Works.
3475960	3479260	And Gaijin Works made Miami Law for the Nintendo DS.
3479260	3482240	It was part of Working Designs.
3482240	3485320	Victor Ireland left them and kind of made this, and so forth.
3485320	3488760	When Working Designs closed, da-da-da-da-da, one thing led to another.
3488760	3491600	So now we have Sunsoft.
3491600	3497280	Quote coming from Ireland, in the, Victor Ireland, that is, in the official announcement.
3497280	3501120	The first Wii release is a great start, but there is one upcoming announcement in particular
3501120	3506320	that will demonstrate just how serious Yoshida-san is about rebuilding the Sunsoft console gaming
3506320	3507520	brand here.
3507520	3509640	Game fans are going to be pretty happy when they hear about it.
3509640	3511520	I know I was.
3511520	3513440	So I'm kind of curious, what other big games did Sunsoft do?
3513440	3516840	I'm trying to think what their other big franchises were, because I know they had more than that.
3516840	3518400	Did you say Victor Ireland?
3518400	3519400	Yes, from Working Designs.
3519400	3520400	From Working Designs.
3520400	3521400	Yeah.
3521400	3522400	We have his Twilight Zone.
3522400	3523400	Really?
3523400	3524400	Yes.
3524400	3527200	Well, he's the guy you can thank for bringing Sunsoft back to life.
3527200	3528200	Thank you.
3528200	3529200	And thank you for your pinball table.
3529200	3531800	Wait, do you have his contact information then?
3531800	3533520	Dan might.
3533520	3535200	Could we get him on the show possibly, maybe?
3535200	3536200	That would be kind of nice.
3536200	3537200	Let me see if Dan still has it.
3537200	3538200	Yeah, try to make that happen.
3538200	3541560	But no, Dan actually bought his Twilight Zone.
3541560	3546240	And so he gave us, you know that Goemon doll that I have?
3546240	3548880	He gave us a Goemon doll, because they had a whole bunch of them, because they were supposed
3548880	3552880	to be for pre-ordering the Goemon game that they never brought out.
3552880	3557320	Let's see, here's some of the other big things that Sunsoft did.
3557320	3559240	Arrow the Acrobat.
3559240	3561280	They did the Blaster Master series, of course.
3561280	3564640	They did some of the Batman games, like the original Batman on the NES, which was not
3564640	3565640	too bad.
3565640	3570040	Let's see, they did Fester's Quest, of course.
3570040	3574980	Some of the Final Fantasy Legend, I guess, games were translated by them, or localized
3574980	3577560	or whatever you want to say by them.
3577560	3580520	Freedom Force, lol.
3580520	3581600	Lemmings on the NES.
3581600	3584680	They did a lot of NES ports of games that were big on other systems.
3584680	3588920	Like Fantasy Zone on the NES was Sunsoft.
3588920	3590640	You remember how they had like a version of that?
3590640	3592520	That was done by Sunsoft.
3592520	3595040	So hmm, very interesting.
3595040	3599680	Spy Hunter on the NES was them, as well as Super Spy Hunter.
3599680	3603480	I'd be very curious to see what they have planned.
3603480	3604480	We'll see.
3604480	3608280	Hope, I would love for some type of like sequel to Blaster Master, because clearly that's
3608280	3612080	their huge, huge franchise, and something better than the one that was on Genesis, because
3612080	3615400	the one that was on Genesis, not so great.
3615400	3618520	Anyhow, speaking of stuff worthy of the Virtual Console, we're going to take a trip down
3618520	3624220	memory lane in a segment we like to call the Classic Game of the Week.
3624220	3627640	And every week in the Classic Video Game of the Week segment, Dark Sakura takes a trip
3627640	3632480	to the video game vault and pulls out a game that she thinks, dammit, you ought to be playing
3632480	3633480	this game.
3633480	3639520	Super Snappers, you need to dust off your NES, or SNES, or as in the case of a lot of
3639520	3643520	these games, Sega related systems, and play this game.
3643520	3646360	So Dark Sakura, what is the Classic Game of the Week?
3646360	3647360	Final Fight!
3647360	3649920	Ah, a topically inspired game, I see.
3649920	3650920	Yep.
3650920	3655160	I got inspired by last week, although actually it was also when I went and picked up my box
3655160	3656160	of Final Fight Guy.
3656160	3658420	I was like, oh yeah, I should do this.
3658420	3659420	Because I found the box.
3659420	3661080	Hold on for a second, play some music.
3661080	3662080	All right, sure.
3662080	3670160	This is the final boss fight in Final Fight Guy, which really would be the same as regular
3670160	3672760	Final Fight 2, but Fighting Belger.
3672760	3682000	Yeah, I'm sorry, I had to get the box, because we're going to take a picture of it.
3682000	3683000	Wow.
3683000	3684680	It is, you'll have to put that on the picture site.
3684680	3685680	I will.
3685680	3688120	Blockbuster exclusive direct from Japan, Final Fantasy Guy.
3688120	3689120	Final Fight Guy.
3689120	3690120	I'm sorry, Final Fight Guy.
3690120	3693440	That was, I got that when I had- Who's going to say Fatal Fury Guy?
3693440	3694440	I've done that before, too.
3694440	3698320	I had my, uh, this one I had my whole little obsession with getting everything Final Fight
3698320	3702560	until they put out a Final Fight that sucks, but I've got Final Fight CD and Mighty Final
3702560	3706640	Fight, which was the SD version that came out on Nintendo, but yeah, let me get, actually
3706640	3707640	get back to the game.
3707640	3713200	Um, Final Fight was an arcade game put out by Capcom, and it was designed by Nishitani
3713200	3719760	Akira, who you will see as Nin Nin, and characters were designed by Yasuda Akira, which you'll
3719760	3725480	see as Akiman, so some of those things should definitely be familiar, all this Capcom-tastic
3725480	3726480	music.
3726480	3733320	So yeah, you gotta go rescue, uh, uh, the mayor's daughter, who happens to be, uh, Cody's,
3733320	3739480	uh, chick, and the mayor is also a former wrestler named Mike Hagar, who showed up in,
3739480	3741720	what, Saturday Night Slam Masters, right?
3741720	3745320	Yes, Saturday Night Slam Masters, which is also amazing.
3745320	3751420	So when this game, though, came out on the, um, the sneeze, or the SNES, sorry, um, you
3751420	3755960	only could play as Cody or Hagar, so they brought out Final Fight Guy, so we could play
3755960	3756960	Guy.
3756960	3763760	Um, he's, though, super fast and was, like, super awesome to play with, so never mind.
3763760	3767240	Um, Cody was the balanced guy, Hagar was the strong guy.
3767240	3771960	He's also ranked third in EGM's list of Top 10 Video Game Politicians.
3771960	3780920	So there were, um, so this game is actually way ahead of, uh, of its time, because it
3780920	3785080	actually had pre-op transgender women in it.
3785080	3786080	Whatever.
3786080	3792420	Anyway, yeah, there are actually two, um, women in the game called Poison and Roxy,
3792420	3799040	but they, um, turned them into men named Billy and Sid, for the American version.
3799040	3800260	So there were.
3800260	3802080	So that you're not hitting women.
3802080	3803080	I guess.
3803080	3807760	Or hoochie women with really short skirts, and, you know, where you can see underboobs.
3807760	3808760	I see.
3808760	3809760	Um, there was a- Underboobs.
3809760	3816200	You know what I mean, when the shirts- I know, I know what you're talking about, it's just,
3816200	3819040	I haven't heard it phrased quite so eloquently before.
3819040	3823480	There was also the Andore family that were all based off of Andre the Giant.
3823480	3824480	Yeah.
3824480	3831280	Um, also, um, a character named 2P that was based, um, off of, uh, Player 2 character
3831280	3832280	from Forgotten Worlds.
3832280	3834280	Did you ever play that game, Rob?
3834280	3835280	Mmm, don't think so.
3835280	3836280	It had, like, the special controller.
3836280	3841400	It was one of Capcom's kind of interesting weird games, but, um, since he looked like
3841400	3843480	the second player, he was called 2P.
3843480	3844480	So anyway.
3844480	3846840	Um, and then you had your bosses.
3846840	3850360	You had Damned, who in the US was Thrasher.
3850360	3856840	Um, you had, uh, Sodom, who was, um, called Katana in the US version.
3856840	3859960	But, um, he came out, and he was one of the ones that was brought back for Street Fighter
3859960	3860960	Alpha series.
3860960	3866840	Um, in fact, that's the other video that I linked you up, was the fight with him.
3866840	3868640	Let me play that one real quick.
3868640	3873240	There's also, uh, Eddie E, and Rolento, who's another one who came in for Street Fighter
3873240	3875560	Alpha.
3875560	3880920	And then Abigail, who's actually a dude, but if I was named Abigail, I'd probably be frustrated
3880920	3882380	and I'm a chick.
3882380	3885960	And then Belger, the final guy, who's actually kind of interesting.
3885960	3891180	You actually start fighting him while he's holding the girl in his lap, and she ducks
3891180	3896760	and screams, and finally he just, you know, she falls over with her butt in the air.
3896760	3897760	Seriously.
3897760	3901460	Like, that's not wrong.
3901460	3902460	So what is this guy?
3902460	3903460	You're fighting a guy named Sodom?
3903460	3904460	Yeah.
3904460	3905840	You have a twin brother named Gamora?
3905840	3906840	What is this?
3906840	3909200	I, well, you know, that's part of why they changed his name.
3909200	3913280	They called him Katana when they came out in the US, but I mean, he's called Sodom in
3913280	3915200	Street Fighter Alpha series.
3915200	3922920	He's like some guy who, like, some huge, he's like the uber crazy violent otaku guy who's
3922920	3927200	like so obsessed with Japanese culture that he, like, wears a samurai hat and football
3927200	3928200	armor.
3928200	3929200	Or football padding.
3929200	3930200	That's stupid.
3930200	3931200	But yeah.
3931200	3942640	But they said that the basis for Final Fight is actually off Double Dragon 2, the revenge
3942640	3949600	in the arcade, so they brought it up and they actually were saying that some of the characters
3949600	3951440	were former Street Fighters.
3951440	3952440	So it's kind of neat.
3952440	3956780	So yeah, there was the whole issue with the ports, and I'm actually going to take a link
3956780	3964960	off of the, well, you can actually see pictures up, and I'm going to link them in the chat
3964960	3974200	room, of the changes to the characters, to the poison character.
3974200	3981400	And then, but now for other versions, there's Sega CD, the Sega CD version, which I have,
3981400	3983580	I love Final Fight CD.
3983580	3987540	It's got a range soundtrack and a time attack mode.
3987540	3989200	It's super fun.
3989200	3993680	I've got Final Fight 1 somewhere for GBA.
3993680	3999680	There was, when it came out in the US, actually there was an Amiga Atari ST, Commodore 64,
3999680	4006200	ZX Spectrum, well that was in Europe, and Amstrad CPC version.
4006200	4010480	There was a Sharp X68000 version that came out.
4010480	4014880	There was the one I mentioned, Mighty Final Fight, which was the 8-bit version for NES
4014880	4018360	that had the super deformed, and it's actually super fun.
4018360	4019920	It is really fun and really cute.
4019920	4021920	Cheap and Final Fight.
4021920	4022920	Yeah.
4022920	4027760	Final, well, no, it's super deformed because they are like the really squished up book
4027760	4028760	embodies.
4028760	4031040	Yeah, I've seen it.
4031040	4034760	Also Final Fight came out on the Capcom Classics Collection Volume 1 for PlayStation 2 and
4034760	4041240	Xbox and a portable version, Capcom Classics Collection Remix for PSP.
4041240	4046440	And it had the emulated CPS music, so that was pretty cool.
4046440	4053600	There was also Final Fight Streetwise, which I pretend not to exist because it sucks.
4053600	4058800	Or maybe it was the Final Fight Double Imp.
4058800	4059800	Nope.
4059800	4061840	It was the new one that they tried to do.
4061840	4062840	Yeah.
4062840	4063840	Whatever.
4063840	4066840	Damn, I only knew the Final Fight that was at the local pizza place.
4066840	4067840	Oh, there's also sequels.
4067840	4069840	There was Final Fight 2 and Final Fight 3.
4069840	4070840	I've got those.
4070840	4072840	They were actually fun.
4072840	4082440	Now, there's also an American Street Fighter animated series, and I know it sucks, but
4082440	4085600	they actually had Cody and Guy teaming up with Ken and Ryu.
4085600	4089000	It was really weird.
4089000	4093960	There are also, of course, my KGARs in Saturday Night Slam Masters and Muscle Bomber Duo in
4093960	4097480	Slam Masters 2 The Ring of Destruction.
4097480	4102120	Street Fighter games, you had Guy and Sodom, then Rolento and Cody in Street Fighter Alpha
4102120	4103120	3.
4103120	4105840	And then you had in Street Fighter 3 Second Impact, you had the character that was modeled
4105840	4108920	after Andori, and his manager is Poison.
4108920	4112840	I don't know if you ever played Street Fighter 3.
4112840	4114320	Just a couple times.
4114320	4117040	That was kind of during that phase where I was out of touch with gaming for a little
4117040	4118040	bit.
4118040	4121160	And Guy and Guy are actually going to be in Super Street Fighter 4.
4121160	4124360	Yeah, and I remember that was the story last week that kind of probably got you thinking
4124360	4125360	about this.
4125360	4126360	I think that's pretty cool.
4126360	4132720	Yeah, there was also another 3D fighting game version, Final Fight Revenge.
4132720	4136640	And then, you know, meh.
4136640	4140720	But also, now it sort of seems that they used the same format, though, for a lot of the
4140720	4144400	other games that came out afterwards, like King of Dragons and Knights of the Round.
4144400	4150040	Captain Commando, Warriors of Fate, Cadillacs and Dinosaurs, The Punisher, D&D Tower of
4150040	4154800	Doom, and then Alien vs. Predator, though, I think is one of the best games to come after
4154800	4155800	that.
4155800	4159560	But yeah, a lot of that came through.
4159560	4161560	So yeah, Final Fight.
4161560	4162560	Win.
4162560	4163560	Alright.
4163560	4166960	There it is, your classic game of the week, Final Fight, available on lots and lots of
4166960	4167960	systems.
4167960	4168960	I'll post those pictures.
4168960	4170960	The arcade was one of the most memorable.
4170960	4173920	Alright, that's going to do it for part A here of Orange Launch Radio, but don't go
4173920	4179240	anywhere because we've got plenty more to come in part B, including your Twitter topics,
4179240	4182680	which I haven't put a call out for on Twitter yet, but we'll get those.
4182680	4184280	And I haven't seen any emails this week.
4184280	4186760	I don't even know if we'll have any of those, but we'll get to those.
4186760	4190800	But we do have some news, if nothing else, talking about Red Box expanding to Game Rental,
4190800	4194280	which I think has come up on the show before, but now it's going to the next step.
4194280	4196080	Somebody beat World of Warcraft.
4196080	4198080	Yes, somebody beat it.
4198080	4202640	More things to waste money on your Xbox Live avatars with, and of course, it wouldn't be
4202640	4205840	Lolsy if we didn't talk about an adult game, so we'll be talking about that all in the
4205840	4206840	next segment.
4206840	4207840	So stay tuned.
4207840	4216480	We'll be right back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
4216480	4220560	Hello everybody, and welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio on this lovely Sunday evening,
4220560	4226280	December the 6th of 2009, where we're eagerly anticipating snow tomorrow here in Sacramento,
4226280	4229840	where Orange Lounge Radio is based, when we never, and this is a big deal, I realize some
4229840	4233200	of you live in the East Coast and even in other countries where snow is probably no
4233200	4234200	big deal.
4234200	4235280	In fact, you probably hate it.
4235280	4239600	But we never see snow here, so even the fact that it's just going to even sprinkle a little
4239600	4241480	white tomorrow is going to be amazing.
4241480	4242480	I'm excited.
4242480	4244160	Too bad it's not Christmas tomorrow.
4244160	4246440	That would make it even better, but oh well.
4246440	4248040	So we're all excited about that.
4248040	4252760	Anyhow, we've got plenty more news to get into tonight here on Orange Lounge Radio.
4252760	4257120	Of course, we always tape live every Sunday night at All Games Radio at 6 o'clock Pacific,
4257120	4261160	9 o'clock Eastern Time, right at the close of the Bobby Black Wolf Show, which is on
4261160	4265840	one hour before we start at 5 or 8, depending on where you live.
4265840	4270960	We're going to get into some rapid fire news, and then we'll get into your Twitter topics
4270960	4272160	in just a little bit.
4272160	4275160	Send them on Twitter if you have anything you want to send us.
4275160	4276160	Yes.
4276160	4280400	So one of the games that's coming out this week, The Saboteur, is getting some day one
4280400	4282160	DLC.
4282160	4287880	And this is to entice you to buy the game new, because if you don't buy it new, then
4287880	4290080	you'll have to purchase this separately.
4290080	4295520	But what you get with the game is a code to download The Midnight Show.
4295520	4300040	And what The Midnight Show is, well, it's the nudity that's in The Saboteur.
4300040	4307720	Lots of naked chicks that do little dances for you, and contains new hiding spots, a
4307720	4313080	new minigame, and of course, it's an option to unlock the nudity, so if you really don't
4313080	4316540	want to see naked women, then you don't have to.
4316540	4319840	And once again, if you do pick up the game used, you will be able to get the download
4319840	4320840	content.
4320840	4327720	It's going to cost you $3 or 240 Microsoft points.
4327720	4328720	Let's see.
4328720	4334000	Dante's Inferno, the God of War-esque type game, will be coming to the PlayStation Network
4334000	4338400	and Xbox Live Marketplace in the form of a demo soon.
4338400	4341920	The PlayStation Network will get it a few weeks early, in fact, you'll be able to pick
4341920	4345080	it up next week on Thursday, December 10th.
4345080	4349600	The Xbox Live Marketplace will be getting it on December 24th.
4349600	4355920	And the game itself is not scheduled to come out until, I believe, February, so got a ways
4355920	4356920	there.
4356920	4361640	And then finally, Santa Claus is coming to PlayStation Home.
4361640	4369360	And you will be able to interact with Santa Claus and the elves and whatnot, and they
4369360	4372440	also have different minigames as well.
4372440	4379120	And of course, there's also a photo elf that you can take pictures with or get some decorated
4379120	4383400	pictures for your home.
4383400	4386600	When I ask for a BB gun, will he tell me you'll shoot your eye out?
4386600	4387600	Perhaps.
4387600	4391840	You know what's funny is my character is still dressed like Santa from last year.
4391840	4393480	Nice.
4393480	4394840	And that's how it's gonna stay.
4394840	4395840	Now you need to change it.
4395840	4400600	You need to change it to like a Halloween outfit or something now that it's Christmas.
4400600	4401600	Nope.
4401600	4402600	Still gonna be Santa.
4402600	4403600	You'll be like Jack Skellington.
4403600	4406880	Cause my guy is like a hobo.
4406880	4409560	Cause you actually paid money for the Santa costume, right?
4409560	4410560	Hobo Santa?
4410560	4412200	Yeah, well that's the only costume I'm wearing.
4412200	4415720	Did you ever log into home, like during June or anything?
4415720	4416960	We still have that club in home.
4416960	4420600	I haven't checked in like a week to see if there's any new people, so sorry if I haven't
4420600	4421600	gone to.
4421600	4423760	But yeah, we still have that little clubhouse in home.
4423760	4425480	Don't know what to do with it.
4425480	4428360	It's been suggested maybe we should have a OLR home meetup.
4428360	4429360	So maybe someday.
4429360	4430360	We'll see.
4430360	4433460	Anyhow, going into some other rapid fire news.
4433460	4434460	Big sale at Walmart.
4434460	4439900	If you still do not have a Wii, now might be the time to do that because for one week
4439900	4444840	from December 5th to 12th, every Wii will come with a $50 gift card.
4444840	4452840	So you take $199 for the Wii, eliminate $50, that's basically give or take $150 for a Wii.
4452840	4457760	Which you could use the $50 gift card to buy games or whatever else you need at Walmart.
4457760	4459840	Also there's some big price dips in games.
4459840	4463220	I wouldn't be surprised if those Wiis were already sold out, sadly, by the time you hear
4463220	4464600	this show.
4464600	4465600	But you never know.
4465600	4468000	Check your Walmart because that deal is supposed to be good for all this week.
4468000	4469700	They might get more shipments during the week.
4469700	4470880	You never know what might happen.
4470880	4472600	But keep an eye out for those cheap deals.
4472600	4475200	It's not just Black Friday.
4475200	4479480	Well I didn't think this game could be possibly ported anywhere else, but I was proven wrong.
4479480	4482020	Dragon's Lair is coming out for the iPhone.
4482020	4486720	That's right, the old school 1983 laser disc game Dragon's Lair that's been released on
4486720	4494240	every single console ever, it seems like anyway, is now coming to the iPhone thanks to Electronic
4494240	4496300	Arts who is doing the port.
4496300	4497720	Not sure exactly how they're doing it.
4497720	4500200	It looks like you have little up, down, left, right arrows on the screen.
4500200	4502280	Right, except the corners of the screen.
4502280	4506000	Basically a big button on the other side for the sword button there.
4506000	4510120	It is coming out for five bucks, I think?
4510120	4512000	Because that's what Space Ace is priced at.
4512000	4515600	So they don't have a final price yet, but Space Ace is five bucks.
4515600	4518720	They also had Cobra Command as well, which is very similar.
4518720	4522720	I might need to get Dragon's Lair, except you know what I just found while I was cleaning
4522720	4524720	off my desk?
4524720	4526720	Dragon's Lair?
4526720	4528920	Dragon's Lair HD.
4528920	4531880	Oh, the HD kind of different one they did a while ago.
4531880	4532880	Yeah, I remember that.
4532880	4534760	Hidden under a layer of stuff.
4534760	4535760	Wow.
4535760	4539520	I tell you, I sneeze and find games, Rob.
4539520	4542000	I still need to take a picture of Final Fight Guy, don't I?
4542000	4543000	Yes you do.
4543000	4545320	Yeah, so I don't know.
4545320	4548960	I will always be partial to the Dragon's Lair that was on the Commodore 64.
4548960	4550120	It was way different.
4550120	4552640	It was like a completely different game.
4552640	4555980	Harder than hell, but a lot of fun, I have to admit.
4555980	4557520	That's the one I'll always be partial to.
4557520	4559880	Anyhow, how about some news about Rock Band?
4559880	4563040	Of course, it wouldn't be a week here at OLR if we didn't have news about upcoming Rock
4563040	4564280	Band releases.
4564280	4566720	More Green Day coming out for Rock Band.
4566720	4570840	Apparently Christian's Inferno, Last of the American Girls, and Viva La Gloria, which
4570840	4575600	I believe are all off the latest CD, 21st Century Breakdown, are on their way on December
4575600	4581680	15th or December 17th, depending on what system you're on.
4581680	4585360	But also to look forward to in Rock Band, some songs coming out within the next couple
4585360	4586360	of weeks.
4586360	4589400	This week, actually, December 8th or December 10th.
4589400	4592800	Slipknot songs, Duality, Psychosocial, and Sulphur.
4592800	4596600	And then some individual tracks, a track by Lights Resolve called Dreaming of Love, which
4596600	4600160	is free, by the way, so you can check that out for free.
4600160	4605080	And this is kind of awesome in a real dorky sort of way, Simon and Garfunkel are getting
4605080	4606880	some songs in Rock Band.
4606880	4611860	I Am A Rock and The Sounds of Silence, because when you want to rock, I know the first thing
4611860	4614120	you think of is Simon and Garfunkel.
4614120	4616960	Dark Soccer, what do you got for us tonight?
4616960	4622700	Just a few things, actually, and it isn't actually the page I was looking at about the
4622700	4632360	land of make-believe, Gearbox actually trademarked border worlds, so the rumor is that Borderlands
4632360	4639480	could be extended into an actual universe of games, and Borderlands is pretty fun from
4639480	4643720	what I've seen, so I could see, and you know, everyone I've actually talked to that's played
4643720	4646080	it says that it's a fantastic game.
4646080	4651080	So I can actually see the expansion happening, you know, I think it'd be a good thing.
4651080	4654400	Lots of, you know, shooting midgets.
4654400	4659760	And then the UK has a date for Metal Gear Solid Peace Walker, it will be the 28th of
4659760	4671520	May, and of course that's going to be on, sorry, PSP, and actually in Japan it's going
4671520	4674420	to be coming out on March 18th.
4674420	4679900	So four-player co-op, it can be Snake, Snake-oo!
4679900	4688120	And then Squeenix put out a song, a game, a song summoner for iPhone, it's actually
4688120	4696080	called Song Summoner The Unsung Heroes for iPhone and iPod Touch, and that it's got touchscreen
4696080	4703120	controls of course, and characters in different scenarios, and it's supposed to be out, there's
4703120	4710000	a demo for it out actually, and for UK customers it'll be £5.99, so.
4710000	4714760	I've heard that Song Summoner is kind of anth though, because it was out on the old-school
4714760	4720480	iPod, you know, well, in other words the iPods a lot of people still have really, they came
4720480	4725040	out on those a while ago, and I think it was kind of under the radar because the iPhones
4725040	4727960	and iTouches had already come out and a lot of those releases got missed, but.
4727960	4731280	I'd like to see what they've actually managed to do with it.
4731280	4733640	Yeah, you never know, they might have like kind of changed some things and done some
4733640	4737800	upgrades too, so it would be kind of cool to see what is going on.
4737800	4741280	What I'd like to see what's going on with right now is the Twitter topic, so let's open
4741280	4745680	up ye old Twitter, and see what you guys have to say, a very fast night with the Twitter
4745680	4748360	topics by the way, I'm quite impressed.
4748360	4752040	SEG starting us off tonight, of course with another plug for OOMLOUD, because that's happening
4752040	4755520	this week, SEG wants to know, are y'all going to OOMLOUD?
4755520	4759240	I'm going for sure, but I think the fact that it's on a weeknight is kind of screwing with
4759240	4760640	everyone else because it is a couple hours away.
4760640	4762520	Everyone has to usually work at six in the morning.
4762520	4765640	Yeah, I'm able to kind of swing it where I'm getting off work a little early so I can make
4765640	4769080	it, but it might, I might be the sole representation there.
4769080	4774640	Sorry, but I'm going to have three times the fun, so meh.
4774640	4778560	Hope to see some of you listeners there that are local to San Francisco.
4778560	4781960	Alex Carson says, I'm going to make a PSP app for your show if that's okay with you
4781960	4782960	guys.
4782960	4790400	Actually, we do have a PSP website, olrpsp.com, and you can download a PSP radio tuner there,
4790400	4793800	I forgot about that in the earlier part of the show, because Loki hasn't updated it in
4793800	4797160	a couple years, so whereas you might have some broken graphics and things, I think it
4797160	4798160	still works, right?
4798160	4801920	Loki, I don't know, have you checked that out in a while?
4801920	4803440	I think it still sort of works.
4803440	4804440	Yeah.
4804440	4805440	So you might want to check that out.
4805440	4809120	If you can make it better, hey, we are not going to complain.
4809120	4811440	I got to tell you, we would be very excited about that.
4811440	4815000	Spazinator going off on us a little bit, no offense, but Californians don't know squat
4815000	4816000	about snow.
4816000	4819000	Try sending many winters in Buffalo, then you'll know about snow.
4819000	4821000	No, I agree.
4821000	4824520	The one-eighth of an inch of snow you're getting pales in comparison to what we usually get,
4824520	4826400	six inches to as much as two feet.
4826400	4829600	I do want to say, though, careful, because when you say Californians, you're talking
4829600	4833880	about the entire state of California, we do have actually a lot of snowy places in California.
4833880	4839000	I don't live in one, but we have Lake Tahoe, for example, they get a lot of snow up there,
4839000	4844680	so careful, California is not all beaches and surfers.
4844680	4845680	Let's see.
4845680	4852560	Dark Tetsuya says, Arcade Heroes is picking the best arcade game of the past decade, 2000
4852560	4854240	to 2009.
4854240	4855240	Thoughts?
4855240	4859720	My thought is, I'm kind of sad because this was the decade that arcades kind of died and
4859720	4863680	got replaced with ticket redemption machines, so I don't know if I have an easy answer.
4863680	4871200	Anyone have an answer for what the best arcade game of the past 10 years would be?
4871200	4872200	Strider 2.
4872200	4875240	I mean, obviously, DDR was somewhat impactful for us.
4875240	4876240	Strider 2?
4876240	4886200	I would say also maybe like, what was it, oh gosh, oh, I know, Final Furlong, horsey
4886200	4887200	riding game.
4887200	4888200	Final Furlong.
4888200	4889200	Horsey Humping!
4889200	4890200	Yes, and Derby Owner's Club.
4890200	4891200	Derby was pretty good.
4891200	4895240	I would say Derby Owner's Club just because it's so fucking epic, like when you see it.
4895240	4901080	I mean, it's like, it's the size of an arcade, amazing.
4901080	4903200	So there you go, those would be some of my picks.
4903200	4908600	And if none of those work, then eh, Marvel vs. Capcom 2 is pretty fucking sweet, I gotta
4908600	4909600	say.
4909600	4914160	Let's see, other topics here.
4914160	4919440	Fernando says on the Twitter, Sky, I love you, let's repeal Prop 8 and get married.
4919440	4924880	Hey, I'm all about repealing Prop 8, which is some major bullshit, but I think you might
4924880	4928900	need to take me to dinner first before I agree to get married, just saying.
4928900	4933560	Alex Carson wants to know, how many of you are phone freakers?
4933560	4934560	What is that?
4934560	4936200	I don't even, like it's like hacking your phone, right?
4936200	4937200	Yeah, I'm not.
4937200	4941800	Is that like, back in the day, like people used to modify like those Captain Crunch whistles
4941800	4946040	to be able to like, dial the phones, when back in the day it was the rotary pulse dials?
4946040	4948320	Like is that the kind of stuff we're talking about?
4948320	4950160	Like old school hacking stuff?
4950160	4955680	I find that stuff interesting, but I don't do it myself.
4955680	4957640	Plus it's all like cell phones now.
4957640	4964400	I've decided what I'm going to do when I get my new iPhone, is take my old one and pimp
4964400	4968320	it out to look all steampunk, which I'm probably going to do with my new one, because even
4968320	4972360	though yes, it's a great design, a lot of work went into the design of it, I bought
4972360	4977160	it, I want to change it up a bit, so I'm going to, but I've decided that I'm going to release
4977160	4983960	it as the limited edition Dark Sakura old school iPhone, and sell it for 700 bucks.
4983960	4989960	Let's see, Javier Altman on Twitter says, OLR, pick your topic, the platypus is made
4989960	4995400	out of other animal spare parts, or the Saboteur Boobies DLC with love footy.
4995400	5000500	Well, we already talked about the Saboteur Boobies DLC, so the platypus is made out of
5000500	5001800	other animal spare parts.
5001800	5004360	Isn't that like a hot dog, actually, you're talking about?
5004360	5009840	I think that the platypus is God going, see?
5009840	5015200	Blue Swim says, what do you think of the Best Buy giving DSI buyers a free copy of Tony
5015200	5020320	Hawk's Motion, a game which requires a GBA port to play?
5020320	5024200	This is where if I had the Price is Right losing horn queued up, I'd play it right now.
5024200	5026480	That's kind of humorous, actually, in a sick way.
5026480	5027480	That's hilarious.
5027480	5028480	That's a Best Buy movie.
5028480	5031680	I didn't hear about that at all, actually, so thank you for bringing that to my attention,
5031680	5034880	because it's pretty lolsy.
5034880	5039920	Master of the Claw sent us a YouTube link to some people having fun jamming.
5039920	5043320	Look at that, they're getting down.
5043320	5045200	Oh my God, they're dancing to Bird is the Word.
5045200	5047320	It reminds me of that Family Guy episode.
5047320	5050400	They're playing a game called Just Dance on the Wii.
5050400	5052400	Bird is the Word.
5052400	5054160	Bird, bird, bird.
5054160	5055520	Did you hear?
5055520	5058160	Bird is the Word.
5058160	5062120	The fact that it's in that game, that makes the game 100% good.
5062120	5067360	Yeah, I heard of this game and it looked ridiculous, but now that I know that it's tongue-in-cheek
5067360	5072400	ridiculous, I'm far more interested, so thank you for bringing it to my attention.
5072400	5076640	That guy is just getting down in that chick.
5076640	5078800	I don't think that chick would be getting down like this, though, if you weren't paying
5078800	5079800	her to do it.
5079800	5082960	She looks a little bit emo.
5082960	5084140	That's awesome.
5084140	5086760	That game does kind of look like fun, actually.
5086760	5088160	Thank you, Just Dance on the Wii.
5088160	5089880	I am assuming that's out now?
5089880	5090880	I don't know.
5090880	5091880	Yes, that's out now.
5091880	5092880	I don't know, Loki.
5092880	5093880	Been out for a few weeks.
5093880	5095680	Loki, we might have to play that and YouTube it.
5095680	5097680	No, we don't.
5097680	5099280	No, we don't.
5099280	5101720	But Loki, didn't you hear?
5101720	5103000	Bird is the Word.
5103000	5107220	Yes, and granted, I love that song, but I'm not going to play that game.
5107220	5108800	They want a link in chat here.
5108800	5109800	Here you go, chatters.
5109800	5110800	There's the link.
5110800	5117920	It's a bit L-Y link I got from Master of the Claw on Twitter, so you win Twitter tonight,
5117920	5121560	Master of the Claw for getting the bird as the word, and that dancing.
5121560	5122560	Did you notice?
5122560	5124080	They were actually walking around, clucking like chickens.
5124080	5128920	Granted, they were Ubisoft employees, but they tend to go over, yeah.
5128920	5132600	That could be the game of the year right there, if we didn't have President Cat this year.
5132600	5135840	Speaking of President Cat, I got to get this out here real quick.
5135840	5141560	Did you know there's still no word about President Cat getting a release over here in the US?
5141560	5142560	Just so you know.
5142560	5148200	There's still no word on that, but do you know what game is coming out on WiiWare in
5148200	5149520	a couple months?
5149520	5150520	Is that Muscle March?
5150520	5152040	Muscle March is coming out.
5152040	5153880	Do you know what Muscle March is?
5153880	5159440	If you don't know what Muscle March is, you need to YouTube this game immediately, because
5159440	5168060	it's like, it's awesome, but it's like, imagine Cho Aniki meets that game, meets that game
5168060	5173080	show where you have to twist your body to not fall through the wall or whatever, meets
5173080	5179780	crack, pure adulterated crack.
5179780	5183360	I can't believe that game is coming out and yet no word on President Cat, I'm just saying.
5183360	5190400	And all this bullshit about President Cat only sold a hundred copies, source please!
5190400	5193160	I mean, I know probably like a hundred people over here that imported it.
5193160	5196120	Apparently it got a shout out on the 1UP show this week.
5196120	5197120	I don't listen to that show.
5197120	5200880	Yeah, they discovered the game, and so therefore they're informing the internet of the game
5200880	5204040	and they should come over here, and they're the first ones that ever discovered the game.
5204040	5205040	Clearly, yes, they just-
5205040	5206880	Um, how about they're full of shit?
5206880	5208440	Everybody, send letters!
5208440	5211240	Well, to be fair, they didn't call it President Cat.
5211240	5214000	If they had called it President Cat, I would say something.
5214000	5215000	But we referred to it by name.
5215000	5216000	Yeah, I know.
5216000	5217000	I'm just...
5217000	5218000	It doesn't matter.
5218000	5219640	It matters to me!
5219640	5221280	How dare they steal our thunder!
5221280	5222400	I don't, I don't care.
5222400	5223400	I care!
5223400	5226640	I'm all about spreading the word about the game, and if it gets it out there, then whatever.
5226640	5231160	We, it's time, no, no, that's why we don't get recognized, Rob.
5231160	5232160	We need to pimp ourselves.
5232160	5233160	You can't prove it.
5233160	5234160	You can't prove it.
5234160	5235160	I've got the internet.
5235160	5236160	I have the days to post.
5236160	5237160	Alright.
5237160	5239160	I've got to go on a joystick, and, you know.
5239160	5244080	You've got Joystick and Destructoid backing us up, so nah.
5244080	5245320	I just don't care enough.
5245320	5246320	I'm sorry.
5246320	5247960	I don't care enough.
5247960	5250760	I don't want to become the President Cat show, okay?
5250760	5251760	And to be fair-
5251760	5252760	It had its moment.
5252760	5253760	I'm over it.
5253760	5257520	I listened to a little bit of, you know, that, the podcast, and they're like, yeah, we heard
5257520	5262160	it sold, like, 80 copies, so, because there's 81, yo-ho!
5262160	5264760	Ah, yeah, yeah.
5264760	5270000	They're firing on all cylinders over there.
5270000	5274640	Let's see, um, where was I?
5274640	5279880	Matt Ostrowski tweeted us, by the way, one more tweet here that the OLR listeners will
5279880	5280880	want to know.
5280880	5285720	OLR Evolution's second mix will be coming out December 24th for everyone.
5285720	5289100	Oh, that's cool, like a little Christmas present, or Hanukkah present, if you will, whatever
5289100	5291600	it is you're into, or Kwanzaa, I don't care.
5291600	5295880	Whatever you celebrate, Solstice, or, you know, what do Pastafarians celebrate on Christmas,
5295880	5296880	I guess?
5296880	5299320	They, uh, celebrate, uh, Nokimas.
5299320	5301760	I guess that's what it is, a pirate day.
5301760	5306120	Um, anyhow, whatever it is you celebrate this winter, OLR Evolution's second mix is coming
5306120	5311440	out, and if you don't know what that is, it's like a DDR clone type thing, or, they take
5311440	5316080	one of those DDR sims, and they completely reskin it with OLR-related songs, and I think
5316080	5319200	they even, like, take clips of our voice, and now we're, like, the announcers in the
5319200	5320200	game.
5320200	5322160	So, it's a lot of great fan work.
5322160	5323160	It's, you know what-
5323160	5324680	I mean, I definitely need to check this out.
5324680	5326640	I take it as a big compliment.
5326640	5327640	It's amazing.
5327640	5329400	So thank you very much, fans, for putting that together.
5329400	5330400	You guys rock.
5330400	5332360	That Just Dance game looks interesting.
5332360	5333640	Doesn't Just Dance kind of look like fun?
5333640	5337080	It's just, it's only because that song's in there, if it's any other song, I wouldn't
5337080	5338080	give it to it.
5338080	5340620	I will admit, to the tweeter who asked why the hell we hadn't talked about it before,
5340620	5344200	when I saw the box art in, like, the songs they were advertising, I was like, eh, this
5344200	5345800	is, like, gonna be Weech here, or something.
5345800	5350840	I just, I did dismiss it very quickly, but it looks like it could be ridiculous fun.
5350840	5351840	Who knows?
5351840	5357040	If it was called Just Dance featuring the bird, Surfing Bird, you know, a hundred thousand
5357040	5359120	more copies sold right there.
5359120	5364760	All right, let's move on to some more gaming news and Loki.
5364760	5375780	Yes, um, so Red Box, the DVD kiosk rental place that's been popularized by all its locations
5375780	5383200	and Walmarts and various supermarkets and everywhere else in between, they are now test
5383200	5391160	marketing, well, they have been test marketing game rentals in Reno, Nevada and Wilmington,
5391160	5395640	North Carolina, and they're testing them out at two dollars a piece.
5395640	5398640	Yeah, I've been well aware of this.
5398640	5402920	Something we deal with, actually, so.
5402920	5406600	And hopefully it's something that will launch full scale at some point.
5406600	5411840	They're also testing some higher price points, too, for DVD rentals, but that's another story.
5411840	5415260	That's a whole thing, because I hear the movie studios are pissed that they're only charging
5415260	5421800	a dollar for DVD rentals, because it devalues the movie, as in, as if ending up in the five
5421800	5423760	dollar bin at Walmart isn't devaluing your movie.
5423760	5424760	I mean, please get over yourself.
5424760	5430560	I could talk for a long time about how retarded that whole comment of them saying that it
5430560	5434560	devalues movies and stuff, because they're worried that people are going to go to these
5434560	5437720	movies and say, well, I don't have to buy your movies, you know, sell through, I'm just
5437720	5441000	going to go rent it from this kiosk for a dollar.
5441000	5443880	And they figure, oh, if we take that away, then they'll go buy the DVD.
5443880	5448080	No, they'll actually just go rent it from someplace else for less.
5448080	5452400	You know, they're not going to just go, oh, well, I guess I have to go buy the DVD now
5452400	5453960	to watch it.
5453960	5455360	Or they're going to go, oh, well, I'm just going to...
5455360	5459240	What about Netflix, where I get it for free, pretty much, with a subscription?
5459240	5461000	I mean, it's retarded.
5461000	5462400	There are some that have jumped on board.
5462400	5465960	There's some, though, that they realize that they've made a mistake, but they're stubborn,
5465960	5470880	so they're going to stick to their guns, and that's unfortunately the case.
5470880	5473440	This actually, I believe, is unrelated to all that.
5473440	5478560	The reason why I think they're raising their rentals to two dollars is because they're
5478560	5483800	starting to carry more Blu-rays in there, and you can't rent a Blu-ray for a buck a
5483800	5486560	day and expect to make a return on your investment.
5486560	5490480	Yeah, that's true, too, is that they're going to lose money at that rate.
5490480	5493360	But still, I think it's kind of cool, though, two dollar rentals for games, I mean, that's
5493360	5494360	not bad.
5494360	5495360	That's not bad at all.
5495360	5499000	No, I mean, I don't rent games, really, anymore, but if I did...
5499000	5500920	I don't either, but I should.
5500920	5504140	I would save a lot of money if I were smart enough to rent the games.
5504140	5507400	My only issue is that the nearest red box machine I can think of is at Wal-Mart, and
5507400	5509700	I ain't setting foot in that place.
5509700	5512760	But it's just like a few feet into Wal-Mart, I mean, it's like...
5512760	5515840	I have to get through the parking lot and all the people asking me for money.
5515840	5518560	Seriously, the Wal-Mart by where I live is sick.
5518560	5519560	You know why they also Safeway?
5519560	5520560	Check it out.
5520560	5521560	They need to nuke it.
5521560	5523120	I found a secret entrance into the Wal-Mart near where I live.
5523120	5526920	There's actually a side one by where they push the carts in that no one uses.
5526920	5527920	Really?
5527920	5529320	So I actually bypass the front door completely.
5529320	5530360	They don't have one like that here.
5530360	5531360	Just go to Safeway.
5531360	5532360	I'll go to Safeway.
5532360	5533360	Safeway's nice.
5533360	5534360	Yeah.
5534360	5539740	Which is funny, Safeway is next door to Wal-Mart, yet Safeway doesn't have that problem, because
5539740	5542240	Safeway hires security guards.
5542240	5547160	Safeway probably also doesn't want people loitering out front selling shit too, so...
5547160	5551360	I had people knock at my door today, two different people trying to sell me shit.
5551360	5553040	I hate that shit.
5553040	5556560	You know, someone trying to sell me the Sac B so they can get their thousand dollar scholarship.
5556560	5557560	I don't give a shit!
5557560	5560360	Do you know how many of those kids have come to my door in like the past couple weeks?
5560360	5563840	Because when I was home sick with the swine flu, I swear to God, like three of those people
5563840	5564840	came by the house.
5564840	5568600	I'm like, I'm gonna cough on you, and then you're really gonna have something to fundraise
5568600	5569600	for.
5569600	5571600	And then like, do you have any cans?
5571600	5572600	No!
5572600	5573600	I don't have any cans!
5573600	5575000	Go away!
5575000	5578400	People dig through the recycle bin at my house.
5578400	5582520	It's kinda, like, I gotta watch what I throw in there.
5582520	5583520	It's kinda freaky.
5583520	5584520	People suck.
5584520	5589360	Anyhow, Toa Gak in our chat says, threaten to shoot them if they don't get off your property.
5589360	5591520	Sadly, it's not that easy.
5591520	5596860	DarkTattooia is pointing me to the PeopleOfWalmart.com website, which, by the way, love.
5596860	5597860	Love that site.
5597860	5598860	Hilarity.
5598860	5599860	Great time waster.
5599860	5600860	Yes, great time waster.
5600860	5603000	The other person wants to know, is Walmart that bad in California?
5603000	5604440	Depends where you are.
5604440	5605560	There's some really nice ones.
5605560	5607680	There's some really nice Walmarts I will go to.
5607680	5612600	I like the, well, Walmart for me also, when I first moved out here, I could not find a
5612600	5613600	Walmart.
5613600	5615360	We had to go to, like, Elberta to find a Walmart.
5615360	5617560	Yeah, they're only new as of the past, you know, ten years, as long as you've been here.
5617560	5619120	Well, now we have the supercenters now.
5619120	5621120	Yeah, and honestly, that makes the difference to me.
5621120	5622800	If it's a supercenter, it's usually really nice.
5622800	5623800	If it's not, they'll go there.
5623800	5627040	Well, for the longest time, we couldn't have them out here because of actually zoning laws
5627040	5630640	regarding grocery stores, where you could have a certain number of grocery stores within
5630640	5633880	a certain radius of each other.
5633880	5636760	But I think they since lived through that, because I saw them building the one on Antelope
5636760	5641800	way back, well, here near where I live, when I would come home from work, and now it's
5641800	5642800	here, and I love it.
5642800	5646760	And whenever, actually, it's kind of funny, I just stayed in there for two hours when
5646760	5650200	they first opened it, because I was so homesick.
5650200	5652680	When I get homesick, I go to Walmart.
5652680	5657000	Honestly though, why would I ever go to Walmart when there's a Target just a couple blocks
5657000	5662320	away that's brand spanking new, and nice, and even has groceries now?
5662320	5664280	It's Uber Target, and I love it.
5664280	5668440	Actually, Walmart does have better prices for certain things, like, okay, I know you're
5668440	5670320	not a chick, but...
5670320	5671320	Tampons?
5671320	5675320	No, actually, the hair dye that I buy actually get cheaper.
5675320	5680240	A lot of the stuff that I get actually, I tend to get a whole lot cheaper than action
5680240	5684360	figures.
5684360	5689880	Where else can I go to get, you know, a bag of baby spinach, and then run it over and
5689880	5695560	buy some Equate brand NyQuil stuff?
5695560	5697280	Hitstun is mentioning Costco.
5697280	5699000	Actually, it was Marissa that first said it.
5699000	5701440	Screw Sam's Club, Costco for the win.
5701440	5706360	Costco's pretty awesome if you need, like, 15 of something.
5706360	5710600	Because seriously, like, I think a great arrangement would be to have, like, a really good friend
5710600	5713600	that you can go, like, shopping at Costco with for your necessities, and then split
5713600	5715400	what you buy in half.
5715400	5716400	You know what?
5716400	5717400	It would be a smart arrangement.
5717400	5718400	You know what?
5718400	5719400	We do.
5719400	5720400	Well, we actually did just get a Costco membership, but we had a friend.
5720400	5723760	Actually, our landlord, but he's a buddy of ours, has a Costco membership, and then Dan
5723760	5728640	is our friend Julie's complimentary spouse.
5728640	5729640	Nice.
5729640	5733720	I actually got pissed off over that the first time, though.
5733720	5734720	Yeah, yeah.
5734720	5736440	But I think we have our own membership now, but still.
5736440	5739560	I like Costco quite a bit, actually.
5739560	5743360	All joking aside about the bulk items, they do have really good deals on, like, TVs and,
5743360	5744520	you know, the high-end stuff.
5744520	5746200	Like, I got my TV at Costco.
5746200	5749080	Well, I told you about what happened with ours, right?
5749080	5755040	Well, keep in mind, with Costco, you can return anything anytime without your receipt.
5755040	5756040	You can just go.
5756040	5757600	It'll be on your membership card.
5757600	5758600	Yeah.
5758600	5764180	So we took, we had our old 50-inch widescreen TV, and we actually took it back to exchange
5764180	5767880	it for, you know, something that was equivalent.
5767880	5771440	And we actually now have a 52-inch LCD widescreen.
5771440	5775960	So because we could exchange it for anything equivalent, and it was the only equivalent
5775960	5777780	they had, our old model is not made anymore.
5777780	5781840	They do have a great return policy at Target, or not Target, at Costco.
5781840	5784520	I did have a TV break, and I took it back, and they took it back.
5784520	5785520	Amazing.
5785520	5787840	Anyhow, I don't know how we got from Redbox to Costco, but we did.
5787840	5788840	So there you go.
5788840	5793960	World of Warcraft, moving on to this crack of a game, World of Warcraft, World of War
5793960	5794960	crack.
5794960	5795960	I'm addicted.
5795960	5796960	What can I say?
5796960	5797960	It's fun.
5797960	5798960	But did you hear that it got beaten?
5798960	5801760	Yes, somebody beat the World of Warcraft.
5801760	5806520	And of course, they live in Taiwan, and the character's name is Little Gray, if you translate
5806520	5807520	the name.
5807520	5809320	They've beat the World of Warcraft.
5809320	5810480	What do I mean by beat?
5810480	5813720	No, I don't mean they beat the final raid in the game, because then a lot of people
5813720	5815080	have beat it, if that's the case.
5815080	5822680	No, they have gotten every single achievement in World of Warcraft, all 986.
5822680	5824680	Someone has no fucking life.
5824680	5825680	Here's my thought.
5825680	5827320	I bet multiple people are splitting this account.
5827320	5829160	I bet multiple people contributed to this.
5829160	5831000	It probably wasn't just one person.
5831000	5835600	It's still an impressive achievement, though, but at the same time, time to go outside,
5835600	5838280	because there's some achievements in there that are crazy.
5838280	5842720	One of them is that you have to get exalted with Aldor, and then you have to go all the
5842720	5847360	way down to Hated and get exalted with Scryer.
5847360	5849240	That means nothing to people that don't play WoW.
5849240	5850680	It means nothing to me.
5850680	5851680	It takes a lot.
5851680	5852680	It's a lot of fucking grinding.
5852680	5853680	Let's just leave it like that.
5853680	5854680	You know what?
5854680	5856120	It's like trying to gain one level in Final Fantasy XI.
5856120	5858400	It's a lot of fucking grinding.
5858400	5860760	That's a great analogy.
5860760	5862360	That's a fantastic analogy.
5862360	5864520	Yes, and it's accurate, too.
5864520	5870960	Because, I mean, for me, I can't stand to play with more than two people at a time,
5870960	5874040	because I'm like, you're going too fast!
5874040	5879120	So just doing all of that would be like, eeee, wince.
5879120	5883740	I will say, though, despite all the crap I give Final Fantasy XI years out, I am super,
5883740	5886240	super excited for Final Fantasy XIV.
5886240	5889960	Like I'm already seeing that 2010 will be the year I finally quit WoW, because we'll
5889960	5892880	have Final Fantasy XIV and we'll have Star Trek Online.
5892880	5896040	Star Trek Online is going to completely murder any free time I have.
5896040	5897040	I know.
5897040	5898040	That's what I'm looking at, too.
5898040	5899040	I'm going to command a fucking ship.
5899040	5901920	Did you see what they did to the Borg?
5901920	5906280	I've been very good about not looking at any previews for it, because I want to poop my
5906280	5911080	pants from shock and awe the first day I play it.
5911080	5917320	I think that I farted a little bit.
5917320	5922800	To use your analogy, Rob.
5922800	5924280	Don't pin that analogy on me.
5924280	5925280	That's all you.
5925280	5927720	No, you're the one who said you were going to poop your pants.
5927720	5929520	I just used your same analogy.
5929520	5930920	Alright, fine.
5930920	5932840	They did cool stuff.
5932840	5936520	So the Borg made you shard a little bit.
5936520	5942360	Anyway, like some of the stuff that they were talking about is like they were trying to
5942360	5946120	make it to where you could not go back from assimilation, that like they replace your
5946120	5947120	stomach.
5947120	5948120	Wow.
5948120	5951560	Because you don't really need to eat when you have a regeneration cycle.
5951560	5956760	I'm like, wow, these people are geeky on a level that is far beyond my comprehension.
5956760	5958700	So the Borg won't sh- never mind.
5958700	5960320	They can't shit.
5960320	5961320	I wasn't going to go there.
5961320	5964160	Unless they're going to throw up some energy at you or something.
5964160	5968800	They're going to fart sparks.
5968800	5972800	Resistance is futile.
5972800	5975600	Pooped!
5975600	5979720	This was the moment when OLR got flushed down the toilet.
5979720	5984600	That's the moment when the episode literally and figuratively went down the-
5984600	5985600	Hey, I see a shark.
5985600	5986600	Let's jump it.
5986600	5987600	Hey!
5987600	5992880	Rest in peace, Orange Launch Radio, 2002-2009.
5992880	5996760	Alright, let's move on with some more gaming news.
5996760	5999520	Jamie, can you take us in a non-poopy direction, please?
5999520	6004200	Um, sorry, I'm still laughing my ass off.
6004200	6006320	I'm laughing my ass off, so no more pooping.
6006320	6008480	Are you laughing at what Salacious Pop is saying in chat?
6008480	6009480	I'm not looking.
6009480	6015000	They poop Sound Blaster cards from 1998 and laugh at you when they crash your Win 95.
6015000	6017640	I lolled.
6017640	6019400	That's pretty, pretty damn funny.
6019400	6023200	Oh, anyway, okay, so, how about some Tatsunoko vs. Capcom news?
6023200	6024200	Yes, please.
6024200	6026640	Because Tatsunoko vs. Capcom is sexy.
6026640	6036640	Um, so yeah, actually, um, there is something on one of the Mad Cat's, um, employees' flicker
6036640	6045440	that is a Tatsunoko vs. Capcom fighting stick, so that you can actually, uh, play fighting
6045440	6050560	games without having to contort your fingers to actually use the damn Wii controller, even
6050560	6051560	the classic controller.
6051560	6053560	I was going to say, the classic controller is not terrible.
6053560	6055280	But it's not great.
6055280	6059880	It's like trying to play fighting games on the SNES, unless you were dealing with something
6059880	6060880	with only four buttons.
6060880	6064240	But I actually, I was quite fond of Street Fighter II on the SNES, you know?
6064240	6067920	So it was like, well, keep in mind, when I bought my SNES, the first game I went out
6067920	6072080	and got, well, besides Kirby's Avalanche, was Super Street Fighter II.
6072080	6076320	Now, I'm with Dark Tetsuya, though, that would be awesome to have even for virtual console
6076320	6078200	games or a few arcade games.
6078200	6085680	Well, anyway, the theory is that it could be possible that it's going to, uh, be a bundle,
6085680	6091040	like a normal and then arcade bundle, um, like, uh, Street Fighter IV had.
6091040	6093320	So, and it looks, it looks really nice.
6093320	6094320	I hope so.
6094320	6098160	I mean, because honestly, you know what's funny is that playing fighting games at home,
6098160	6104280	I actually do prefer to play on a good controller over playing it on a joystick just because
6104280	6107760	of, um, some of my hand problems.
6107760	6112080	But I would, I would seriously, I would seriously get this.
6112080	6113080	It's sexy.
6113080	6117160	There's a, everybody else's face is covered except for, you know, that crack coach in
6117160	6118160	Lee.
6118160	6123880	But right at the very top of it is Owashi no Ken, and he, he is so cool.
6123880	6129080	I'm kind of surprised at all the love that Tatsunoko versus Capcom is getting, um, getting
6129080	6130240	from Capcom.
6130240	6134040	I kind of assumed that they were going to release this, like they were kind of throwing
6134040	6137680	us a fricking bone, but it really seems like they're giving this an Uber release here.
6137680	6138680	Like they're really trying.
6138680	6144160	Keep in mind, I mean, yeah, maybe not many people over here in the US have heard of Kagaki
6144160	6145160	Ninja Taigajamon, right?
6145160	6151040	But they've heard of Battle of the Planets, they've heard of G-Force, they've heard of
6151040	6153120	even Eagle Riders.
6153120	6159200	I mean, for all the anime fans, Gatchaman, the OAVs got a release, um, Kashan got an
6159200	6165920	OAV release, um, Hurricane Polymer, uh, Tekkaman, all of those, I mean, these are names that
6165920	6171840	are known in a lot of the, the, uh, anime slash video game industry, I guess, or, you
6171840	6172840	know, fan base.
6172840	6173840	I'll give you that.
6173840	6177560	I mean, this is definitely is catered to the anime convention going crowd, but there's
6177560	6180680	a damn lot of anime convention going people, you know what I mean?
6180680	6183400	And there's enough people that would take interest in a game like this.
6183400	6184800	Do you see this evil book?
6184800	6185800	Um, Amano.
6185800	6188000	I have the giant book of Amano.
6188000	6192880	He did the character designs for Gatchaman and a lot of the early Tachinoko characters.
6192880	6195560	So I'll find it and put the picture up.
6195560	6197120	All right.
6197120	6198120	Sounds good.
6198120	6199120	Oh, here we go.
6199120	6200120	I opened right to it.
6200120	6201120	What'd you open to?
6201120	6202120	What are you showing me?
6202120	6203120	Oh, those are, those are pretty.
6203120	6204120	Oh, some of the characters.
6204120	6205120	I see.
6205120	6206120	Here.
6206120	6207120	Oh, okay.
6207120	6208120	Very cool.
6208120	6209120	This makes for great radio, by the way.
6209120	6210120	Can I just point out?
6210120	6211120	Okay.
6211120	6212120	Very cool.
6212120	6213120	Take a picture.
6213120	6214120	I'm gonna put a picture up.
6214120	6215120	All right.
6215120	6216120	Meanwhile, Loki, let's move on with some more gaming news.
6216120	6217120	Yes.
6217120	6221240	There's a new Xbox Live Arcade game going to be coming out March 2010.
6221240	6225840	It's called Scourge Project, and it's a third person shooter game.
6225840	6230060	It will be coming out on Steam, Xbox Live Arcade, and the PlayStation Network.
6230060	6233420	And what's kind of notable about it is it actually looks really good.
6233420	6236560	And it's being powered by the Unreal 3 engine.
6236560	6240860	It's kind of a co-op shooter game where they've got four different storylines with each player,
6240860	6245740	you know, being able to, in the team, you can play as four different players, and then
6245740	6250000	you can have a unique perspective on the story with each player that you play as.
6250000	6255560	And they've also got online deathmatch for up to 16 players as well.
6255560	6258720	And I don't know, it looks pretty awesome.
6258720	6262240	Really high quality for even, like, an Xbox Live Arcade game.
6262240	6267280	You know, kind of almost something that I would expect from a console, just a standard
6267280	6268860	disc release.
6268860	6271680	But something to definitely look forward to.
6271680	6275640	It was actually announced back in 2007, but I guess it took them this long to actually
6275640	6277000	get it finished.
6277000	6279400	But eh, whatever.
6279400	6284960	And like I said, it's scheduled to arrive March 2010, so it's going to be pretty awesome.
6284960	6285960	All right.
6285960	6291600	Well, something you can get much sooner than March 2010 is some more crap for your Xbox
6291600	6292600	Live avatar.
6292600	6293600	That's right.
6293600	6297420	If you love dressing up your virtual Barbie with, you know, spending nickels and dimes
6297420	6301520	here and there on new outfits and things like that, guess what you can get now very soon?
6301520	6302520	Animals!
6302520	6305200	Cute fuzzy widow animals!
6305200	6306200	That's right.
6306200	6309000	You can get a dog or a pug dog or a dog in a bag.
6309000	6310680	I'm assuming that's like a Paris Hilton dog.
6310680	6311680	Bag dog.
6311680	6312680	Yeah, bag dog.
6312680	6316920	You can get a cat, a Siamese cat, a long haired cat, or if you're not a cat or dog person,
6316920	6323000	you can get a goldfish, a guinea pig, monkey, bird, snake, or you can get a pony.
6323000	6324000	That's right.
6324000	6327520	If you've always wanted a pony, you can now have one for the low, low cost of 240 Microsoft
6327520	6328700	points.
6328700	6330920	In the real world, that's $3.
6330920	6333520	$3 for a virtual pet.
6333520	6334680	That's your thing.
6334680	6335680	Have fun.
6335680	6337400	What can I do with this virtual pet?
6337400	6338400	Um,
6338400	6343400	Or is it just going to be like a handbag, like, you know, I have the dog.
6343400	6348760	Well you can see a little picture of the avatar with the dog and I guess they, they pet it.
6348760	6349760	Um,
6349760	6350760	Can I have multiple animals?
6350760	6354600	The dog probably barks, but not really because I don't think the avatars make sound.
6354600	6355600	They should allow you to have multiple animals.
6355600	6359280	Like, I want to be a virtual cat woman in the game and have like 800 cats.
6359280	6361440	Did you just say you want to be a virtual cat woman?
6361440	6362560	Did I hear that correctly?
6362560	6363560	Cat lady.
6363560	6366400	Not cat woman as in like, you know.
6366400	6369960	Just hearing you talking about your dream of being a cat lady is kind of amusing to
6369960	6370960	me.
6370960	6373920	It's like an avatar because you like, you flip over and see what your friends are doing
6373920	6382080	and all of a sudden it's like, what the fuck is, is there a person under all those cats?
6382080	6383080	Oh, I want to see.
6383080	6384080	I see.
6384080	6385080	You don't want to be like Michelle Pfeiffer.
6385080	6386080	No, no, no.
6386080	6387080	God.
6387080	6391200	You want to be the lady that lives in the shoe that has 500 cats that you hear about.
6391200	6392200	What's in the shoe?
6392200	6393200	You hear about.
6393200	6394200	She has so many cats.
6394200	6395200	She didn't know what to do.
6395200	6399440	I've maybe combined a couple of things there, but she's the lady you see on the news that,
6399440	6404360	you know, she died in the house and all the cats like, you know, ate her and then, you
6404360	6407520	know, suddenly the SPCA doesn't know what to do with all these cats, so they're trying
6407520	6410200	to find home, homes for 500 cats.
6410200	6412240	500 human eating cats.
6412240	6413240	Exactly.
6413240	6415840	I can find a home for them.
6415840	6420160	Our prison system.
6420160	6421160	But they're adorable.
6421160	6427560	By the way, I just want to point out, people are actually going to spend money on this.
6427560	6428560	That's right.
6428560	6432000	People will spend $3 so that they can have a cutesy little pet.
6432000	6433000	Here's my problem.
6433000	6434000	It just goes to you.
6434000	6435000	I want to make a point.
6435000	6436000	This is very important.
6436000	6439320	This just proves my point, and I've said this before on the show.
6439320	6446880	This will make money because America loves cats.
6446880	6449040	But the cat they have is the Siamese cat.
6449040	6450040	That's unacceptable.
6450040	6451040	There's more.
6451040	6452040	There's other cats, too.
6452040	6453040	No, there's just the Siamese cat.
6453040	6454040	There's the long-haired cat.
6454040	6455620	Oh, well, I don't have a long-haired cat.
6455620	6457440	I want a cat that looks like my cat.
6457440	6461240	I have Shermie that sheds enough for 50 cats.
6461240	6466880	By the way, the Final Fight Guy pictures are up at the Orange Zones Radio Gallery.
6466880	6472020	I want a guy cat that wears an orange jumpsuit and karate kicks intruders.
6472020	6474080	That's what I want.
6474080	6477320	That I might pay $3 for.
6477320	6479200	Whatever.
6479200	6480200	It's your money.
6480200	6481720	Spend it on whatever makes you happy.
6481720	6482720	That's what I say.
6482720	6486720	Hey, now's the part of the show that we're going to get to the mailbag, and we're going
6486720	6490080	to open up the old mailbag and see what's in there and read some emails.
6490080	6491080	Although, I don't know if we...
6491080	6492760	At last, I went in there before the show started.
6492760	6493760	We didn't have a damn thing.
6493760	6494760	We got two things, Rob.
6494760	6495760	Woo!
6495760	6496760	Jack and shit.
6496760	6497760	Oh, I thought we actually had an email.
6497760	6498760	Nope.
6498760	6501080	Well, part of that probably has to do with the fact that we didn't get a show last week
6501080	6503700	up because of internal problems, so big whoops.
6503700	6509520	This will serve as a reminder, though, that you can always email our show mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.
6509520	6515000	Funny how that works, that sometimes we get like 100 Twitters like we got tonight, and
6515000	6516000	then no emails.
6516000	6519360	And then some nights we'll have like 50 emails and no Twitters or something else.
6519360	6521800	All right, so we'll roll over.
6521800	6522800	And don't email us now.
6522800	6523800	It's going to do no good.
6523800	6524800	You missed your chance.
6524800	6525800	So we'll roll them over to next week.
6525800	6527440	So there you go.
6527440	6530320	But there's always time for ranting.
6530320	6533920	And usually right after the mailbag, we take a moment to rant about something, and this
6533920	6534920	week's no different.
6534920	6552760	We had the FUs of the Week.
6552760	6557520	We have a story tonight to inspire the FUs, just to get your ranting warmed up a little
6557520	6558520	bit.
6558520	6567240	And that is that a Florida father apparently was arrested and thrown in a slammer for getting
6567240	6574360	high, gaming all night long, and then falling asleep on his seven-month-old daughter, which
6574360	6576880	suffocated the poor thing to death.
6576880	6580080	His name, Emanuel Lawrence, 30.
6580080	6585200	And he finished a marathon game session at 6 a.m., and he laid her on the bed next to
6585200	6587440	him, rolled over, and dot, dot, dot.
6587440	6590120	I don't need to describe what else happened.
6590120	6592120	This makes me angry for two reasons.
6592120	6596240	One, I think it's pretty obvious he was an idiot.
6596240	6601320	Two, I'm seeing this on game blogs, and with all due respect to the lovely people that
6601320	6605400	work very hard on game blogs, this story has nothing to do with gaming, and it shouldn't
6605400	6608240	... This guy's an idiot.
6608240	6609240	That's the problem.
6609240	6613320	I mean, the fact that he was gaming all night long, he could have just been easily watching
6613320	6615240	movies or doing something else.
6615240	6618520	It has nothing to do with games, so don't run it on the game blogs, because it just
6618520	6623400	supports that notion that somehow it was connected to the games, when we all know it wasn't.
6623400	6625800	He was just a stupid, stupid head.
6625800	6627740	A stupid, stupid head.
6627740	6631120	And for that, he can go live with the 500 human-eating cats, for all I care.
6631120	6634560	Dark Soccer, your FUs of the Week, please.
6634560	6638520	FU to the wimpy California people.
6638520	6640760	It's just a little snow.
6640760	6643880	If you really don't... I'm excited.
6643880	6644920	I'm not really excited either.
6644920	6647240	I actually feel really indifferent about the whole thing.
6647240	6652600	I'm just like... Well, I suppose it's novel, but at the same time, I'm like, dude, if you're
6652600	6655720	afraid of people on the road, don't go out.
6655720	6657840	If you have to go to work, drive safely.
6657840	6658840	Stick to the slow lane.
6658840	6660840	I'm going to call in snow to work tomorrow.
6660840	6663280	Well, they also sent us that warning.
6663280	6667100	And by the way, thank you for sending me the warning while I'm in the middle of doing really
6667100	6668100	good stitches.
6668100	6669800	And also, fuck this hat.
6669800	6671200	Hi, husband!
6671200	6673240	Low-key, your FUs of the Week, please.
6673240	6674240	My husband just arrived.
6674240	6678360	Um, FU to people trying to sell me shit at my house.
6678360	6682840	I hate hearing the doorbell ring and going to the door and not recognizing the person.
6682840	6686200	I always assume that maybe it's a kid that threw a ball into our backyard or something
6686200	6690820	like that, and the dumb me answers the door, and it's always someone trying to sell shit
6690820	6694600	or someone that wants cams for me to donate to them for shit.
6694600	6697480	I don't have your fucking... Are you sure you don't want a subscription to the SACB?
6697480	6698480	No, I don't want a subscription.
6698480	6700480	Because if you don't subscribe, I'm going to die.
6700480	6702480	You're like, well, you... I'm not going to be able to go on my trip.
6702480	6707800	I'm going to get my $1,000 scholarship, I'm going to be stupid!
6707800	6708800	I don't give a fuck.
6708800	6712840	You're an idiot already if you think that you're going to get a $1,000 scholarship from
6712840	6717160	the SACB for walking door-to-door to sell their fucking subscription.
6717160	6718600	You're an idiot.
6718600	6723120	Maybe you should have been smarter in the first place, and you wouldn't have to walk
6723120	6729320	door-to-door selling subscriptions to newspapers and said you'd be earning a scholarship from,
6729320	6734200	I don't know, someone that celebrates academic excellence.
6734200	6735200	You're an idiot.
6735200	6738000	And I don't want your fucking SACB subscriptions.
6738000	6739520	I don't care how you give them to me.
6739520	6741520	Get the fuck out!
6741520	6747400	Uh, I'm, I'm, I'm in a pretty good mood today, so I don't really have a lot of FUs.
6747400	6749360	I guess FU to traffic.
6749360	6753280	Like people driving to San Francisco don't know what they're doing and need to stop.
6753280	6754280	Get off my bridge.
6754280	6757840	FU, FU to the S-curve on the bridge, too, for slowing everything down.
6757840	6761080	Well, you know, a lot of people, a lot of trucks have been running off of it.
6761080	6762080	Did you hear about that?
6762080	6763080	Yeah, I've heard about that.
6763080	6768280	Then drive carefully, but don't, you know, it's just, it's not that that slows things
6768280	6769280	down.
6769280	6770760	It's people cutting in and out of lanes.
6770760	6771760	That's what slows things down.
6771760	6772760	I agree.
6772760	6774920	That shit needs to be illegal at a certain point.
6774920	6777960	And like they need to do the thing where they put the bumps in the road that are so high,
6777960	6780160	you can't cross them.
6780160	6784600	And Kate, unless it's like a real emergency or something, you know, it's just ridiculous.
6784600	6789040	And they should have a way that if you do happen to be stupid enough to drive off the
6789040	6791560	edge that you die.
6791560	6795400	There should be grinders and explosions at the bottom of the hill.
6795400	6799920	And most importantly, human-eating cats living in the bay.
6799920	6802320	That's what they did at Alcatraz, actually.
6802320	6803820	That's how people didn't escape Alcatraz.
6803820	6805360	They had human-eating cats in the water.
6805360	6806360	Cat sharks.
6806360	6807360	That's right.
6807360	6808360	Cat sharks.
6808360	6809360	True story.
6809360	6810360	Look it up.
6810360	6811360	That's right.
6811360	6812360	It's on Wikipedia.
6812360	6813360	Quick, put it on Wikipedia.
6813360	6815360	We've got some good stories for you guys and then we're going to get to your stories on
6815360	6817800	our Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR.
6817800	6819440	But first, some Skype stories.
6819440	6821080	Some Skype stories?
6821080	6822080	What the hell?
6822080	6825160	The Skype line, then some last stories before we get to the Skype line.
6825160	6826160	Say what?
6826160	6827160	I'm dyslexic today.
6827160	6828160	It's crazy.
6828160	6833460	I'm putting up the last of the Amano pictures right now.
6833460	6834460	So they should be up.
6834460	6835460	Run.
6835460	6836460	Go look.
6836460	6837460	Quick.
6837460	6842960	Well, if you're in Japan, there's definitely your share of adult games available out there.
6842960	6852160	And yes, one of these adult games, which features women with extremely large breasts, very unnaturally
6852160	6859000	large breasts, but more power to them for that, and comes from Willowsoft.
6859000	6866600	Well, this game you can also get with a collector's edition that's bundled with a special manga,
6866600	6869720	an audio CD, and a personal assistant.
6869720	6874840	No, that's not a person that takes down notation for you and brings you coffee.
6874840	6877480	It is a pocket pussy.
6877480	6879840	It is a rubber thing that you put your penis in.
6879840	6882360	A fleshlight, basically?
6882360	6883360	Without the fleshlight.
6883360	6884360	No, no.
6884360	6885360	They're called ona cups.
6885360	6887360	As in woman cup.
6887360	6888360	Wow.
6888360	6890960	Just go to Jlist and look at all this stuff.
6890960	6891960	I seriously sell all this stuff.
6891960	6892960	I really don't need to.
6892960	6893960	I just don't.
6893960	6894960	They have commercials for them.
6894960	6895960	It's hilarious.
6895960	6897440	My life will be fine without it, actually.
6897440	6899260	I think it's funny looking at the commercials.
6899260	6903800	And it will be released during Christmas on the 25th.
6903800	6905480	Just in time for the holidays.
6905480	6906480	Just what I always wanted.
6906480	6908920	A pocket pussy to take with me.
6908920	6912920	I did love, though, you gotta share the artwork for the game with our chatters, because I
6912920	6917640	love the unnaturally large breasts that the women had.
6917640	6922800	They were larger than Springer Large, like Jerry Springer's show, when he has the women
6922800	6924460	with the unnaturally large titties.
6924460	6925520	That's gonna cause some back pain.
6925520	6926720	That's a Z cup.
6926720	6927720	That's some back pain.
6927720	6930120	I can't believe she doesn't walk over with a hunch.
6930120	6935240	I mean, that is just amazing.
6935240	6941200	That is some serious, seriously large boobies there.
6941200	6946560	Hey, and you know, and I kinda laugh at some of the stuff that I've seen, you know, like
6946560	6955840	they've got the booby pillows or the booby mouse pads and stuff like that, but that's
6955840	6959520	just a little much, I mean.
6959520	6961280	Sorry I'm laughing at a comment in chat.
6961280	6966480	Salacious Pop comments, I'd carry a pocket pussy with me, but only to give friends sudden
6966480	6969400	nose kisses.
6969400	6973660	Oh my god, if someone did that to me, I think I'd slap them.
6973660	6975880	Although the mental image is really funny.
6975880	6979160	Can you imagine walking up to someone, I kiss you!
6979160	6981920	Wow, their website is sure detailed.
6981920	6982920	What?
6982920	6987480	Oh, and I guess they have different ones depending on which woman that you want to, you know.
6987480	6990080	Oh well, whoopee!
6990080	6992200	Like different depths and widths and everything?
6992200	6993200	No, differently.
6993200	6994200	Are they all loose?
6994200	6995200	They're all different.
6995200	6996200	The women in this game, clearly.
6996200	7000120	They've got different patterns in there, see, you know, you've got the one chick there,
7000120	7004600	the blue, and it's got like, looks like nubs and ribs and then something else.
7004600	7008720	That looks like, okay, that looks like a diagram that you see in a geology book about what
7008720	7011480	it would look like if you drilled to the center of the earth.
7011480	7013240	That's what that looks like to me.
7013240	7016040	Oh, well you're drilling to the center of the earth, alright.
7016040	7018040	Shut up, you ass.
7018040	7021480	And then that one right there looks like a spine and a screw at the top there.
7021480	7023120	It does, it looks like an MRI picture.
7023120	7029720	And that one's got kind of like, you know, some sort of DNA helix thing going on there.
7029720	7032320	Wait a minute, is this radio really happening right now?
7032320	7034400	We're describing pocket pussies on our radio program?
7034400	7037240	You're right, that's not going to help our chat room, I gotta link this into the chat
7037240	7038240	room.
7038240	7039240	Yes you do.
7039240	7041240	The commercials, the commercials are hilarious.
7041240	7043240	No, thank you.
7043240	7047520	Well, you know, Rob, they do make vibrators.
7047520	7055080	Oh, it was funny, the other day we were watching and I, you know, this is the perfect use of
7055080	7056080	our PS3.
7056080	7062320	Oh, and then of course in the one that looks like they're underage of course is in there.
7062320	7063320	You gotta love that.
7063320	7064320	Yay.
7064320	7070600	No, there is like, they had like an interactive device or whatever that you would buy for
7070600	7075760	your PC that's 4.0 use or whatever, but it's interactive, you see, because it's synced
7075760	7078760	up with whatever's on the computer.
7078760	7082480	Technology, gotta love it.
7082480	7084480	Holy moly.
7084480	7089680	I just got a picture of Marissa and she said, were the boobies bigger than mine?
7089680	7091740	Not by much.
7091740	7092740	Not by much.
7092740	7093740	That's an impressive picture.
7093740	7095040	Marissa has the best rack ever.
7095040	7098220	That is an impressive picture.
7098220	7102960	I just want to, like, I am, I am completely secure in my homosexuality, okay?
7102960	7109400	I am 100% secure in my, my fagness, but I want to like bury my face in that.
7109400	7110880	Like, I can't explain it.
7110880	7116840	That's because you have something that's built into male DNA, whether you're gay or not,
7116840	7119000	that boobies are important.
7119000	7120560	Were you breastfed, Rob?
7120560	7121800	I know.
7121800	7122800	That could be part of it.
7122800	7123800	I don't know.
7123800	7124800	I do.
7124800	7126400	Quit trying to make it sound like it's like a psychological thing.
7126400	7128480	It's much more basic than that.
7128480	7130680	Yeah, it looks like they do have multiple box sets.
7130680	7132720	Rob, Rob, it's because boobies are fun.
7132720	7133720	The boobies are fun.
7133720	7136240	That's what it boils down to.
7136240	7138920	You guys are going to have to get her to post the link if you want to see it, because now
7138920	7146440	all the chat is like, link, link, link, link, please, please link, link, please.
7146440	7148640	And Marissa says gay man motorboat me all the time.
7148640	7153320	I tell you, if you post that link in chat, it's going to get really quiet and chat for
7153320	7156720	about the next five minutes.
7156720	7160440	Anyhow, one more story for you guys.
7160440	7165120	And then we're going to get to the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR, and we're going to travel
7165120	7167880	the world here a little bit and go to Brazil.
7167880	7171200	And it sounds like Brazil is following in the footsteps of some other places around
7171200	7173400	the world.
7173400	7180000	It's the home of a recently proposed bill coming from Senator Vladir Raup, and this
7180000	7184240	bill was recently passed by the Education Commission of the Brazilian Senate and is
7184240	7188080	now about to be voted on by the Committee of Constitution and Justice.
7188080	7192720	And what they're trying to do, they're trying to, quote, curb the manufacture, distribution,
7192720	7197840	importation, distribution, yes, it's in there twice, trading in custody, storage of the
7197840	7202620	video games that affect the customs and traditions of the people, their worship, creeds, religions
7202620	7203620	and symbols.
7203620	7208120	In other words, they're basically trying to eliminate video games in bad taste, which
7208120	7213960	could be violent video games and, you know, lots of things among that route.
7213960	7214960	You know what?
7214960	7217600	They've tried to do that many places and it never works.
7217600	7222620	Of course, Brazil isn't this country, but, you know, I just, it would be sad to hear
7222620	7227480	about that, so.
7227480	7232640	Just learn from, you can't stop freedom of expression.
7232640	7238360	I mean, as much as this, like, fleshlight pocket pussy thing is ridiculous, I love the
7238360	7240360	fact that it can be made.
7240360	7241500	You know what I mean?
7241500	7244560	The fact that it exists brings me lols.
7244560	7247080	So, all right.
7247080	7253960	Anyhow, we're going to go to the Skype line now, 1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype
7253960	7254960	is OrangeLoungeRadio.
7254960	7258920	If you want to give us a call, we're going to take some calls right now.
7258920	7262280	The Skype line is open for business, taking your calls.
7262280	7265920	In the meantime, some last-minute stories while we wait for the little delay there.
7265920	7266920	Loki, I don't know if you have anything to say.
7266920	7267920	I have one.
7267920	7268920	Oh, yes.
7268920	7269920	Dark Sakura.
7269920	7270920	Boobs are great.
7270920	7271920	The end.
7271920	7272920	And we're getting a call, so let's take the phone.
7272920	7273920	Hello.
7273920	7274920	You're on OrangeLoungeRadio.
7274920	7275920	Who's this?
7275920	7276920	Hi.
7276920	7277920	This is Spazinator.
7277920	7278920	Hi, Spazinator.
7278920	7279920	What's on your mind tonight?
7279920	7280920	Two things.
7280920	7290840	You know, first, so far, this episode has kind of been the best episode of OLR so far.
7290840	7292680	Well, thank you very much.
7292680	7294920	Is it because it's very porn-tastic tonight?
7294920	7295920	I'm sorry.
7295920	7301000	You know, with my ear infection, it's kind of hard to hear you.
7301000	7302240	Could you repeat that for me?
7302240	7303240	That's all right.
7303240	7304560	Is it because we're porn-tastic tonight?
7304560	7305560	Oh, yeah.
7305560	7308300	I mean, you know, not too sad.
7308300	7309800	You cover your what?
7309800	7313120	Boobs, vaginas, and bodily functions.
7313120	7317440	I mean, yeah, there's probably stuff for you.
7317440	7321200	Nothing, but you can't think of it off the top of my head.
7321200	7322640	The gay man in me is ashamed tonight.
7322640	7325880	I feel like I need to go blow someone after the show, but anyhow.
7325880	7335640	Well, yeah, to get to the main point of my call, yeah, I kind of wanted to touch on something
7335640	7339360	that you were mentioning towards the beginning of the show.
7339360	7340360	Yeah.
7340360	7348360	Well, you know, I mean, with the whole rumor of the PSP Go add-on, and it can relate to
7348360	7355280	the whole, you know, I don't know what you want to call it, flunkers in town, and the
7355280	7361520	motion controller for the PSP, you know, PS3 as well in the sense, it's probably a good
7361520	7369640	idea that the PSP add-on doesn't come out, simply because of one simple reason.
7369640	7378120	Traditionally speaking, add-ons, for instance, do really, really horrible in terms of sales
7378120	7379120	and whatnot.
7379120	7393320	Classic examples are the Sega CD, the 32X, and more recently, the 360 HD DVD add-on,
7393320	7396640	and the PlayStation 2's hard drive.
7396640	7399840	You know, that did loudly.
7399840	7407840	The simple reason for that is that, you know, add-ons, you know, kind of like, flunk through
7407840	7420440	the market a little bit, and game manufacturers can't rely on people buying these add-ons,
7420440	7427720	and therefore, you know, they tend to shy away from catering to these add-ons.
7427720	7431620	There's a lot of add-ons that don't do very well, because they're not very well supported.
7431620	7433920	They're made for, like, one game, and then that's it.
7433920	7436600	You know, you can go back through gaming's history, and there's just tons of stuff that
7436600	7439120	just wasn't very well supported.
7439120	7445280	The Super Scope 6, but some were also very good on the other side, because they got a
7445280	7449800	lot of support for them, like DDR mats did very well, because the games that, you know,
7449800	7450800	came out with them.
7450800	7454320	There was a ton of them, and, you know, folks got use out of them, and the guitar peripherals
7454320	7455320	do very well, too.
7455320	7459480	But don't forget, too, the biggest difference here, when you're talking about the PSP, and
7459480	7462160	what we're talking about at the beginning of the show, is that you're having an add-on
7462160	7463880	for something that should have been there in the first place.
7463880	7468240	It's ridiculous that, you know, you would get this add-on if you, what, just go buy
7468240	7470520	the PSP 3000 if you want a UMD.
7470520	7472520	It makes no sense at all.
7472520	7473520	Yeah.
7473520	7485560	Yeah, you definitely got a point there, in both cases, and also, you know, like you mentioned,
7485560	7494840	the DDR mats and Rock Band, Guitar Hero stuff, you know, does so well, but you gotta be reminded
7494840	7501520	that that kind of stuff is kind of being a minority, in a sense, and the companies that
7501520	7507720	put those stuff out are taking, like, a really, really major risk with that stuff.
7507720	7516360	And in terms of, like, Project Metal and Sony's motion controller, sure, I'm willing to bet
7516360	7522320	that there will be some early adopters that will probably get it for the novelty of it,
7522320	7528720	and probably wouldn't use that stuff for a while, up until the novelty wears off.
7528720	7529720	Well, you know what?
7529720	7530720	Peripherals?
7530720	7534960	I understand peripherals give sometimes developers, I think right now, a false sense of security
7534960	7540200	because DDR's done so well, because Guitar Hero's done so well, but I think Tony Hawk
7540200	7543920	at the right is gonna bring him right back to reminding folks that peripherals don't
7543920	7547840	always make the game, that's for sure, and especially the amount that folks spend on
7547840	7548840	it.
7548840	7549840	Yeah, true.
7549840	7562040	Yeah, the only reason the Wii remote did well is because, in a sense, Nintendo got it right
7562040	7564520	where they packed the stuff in.
7564520	7566520	Right, and that was the system.
7566520	7570120	Every single game has to support it, therefore there's plenty of games out there that support
7570120	7571120	it.
7571120	7574240	But it's very interesting, isn't it, that sometimes folks' complaints about the Wii
7574240	7578240	is that they should make some games that don't support it, you know, that don't overdo it
7578240	7579880	with the motion controls.
7579880	7581600	The Wii's been very interesting.
7581600	7582600	Very interesting.
7582600	7587080	Spaznator, I gotta wrap up and let you go here so we can get some more calls.
7587080	7589360	Do you have any other final thoughts for our listeners?
7589360	7592160	Uh, no, not that I can go.
7592160	7593440	Alright, well thank you.
7593440	7594440	Have a good one.
7594440	7598000	Yeah, thanks as always for the call, Spaznator, and I hope you were able to dig yourself out
7598000	7601760	of the snow that you get there, just like we'll have to dig ourselves out tomorrow morning.
7601760	7602760	Alright.
7602760	7603760	Alright.
7603760	7604760	Take care.
7604760	7610920	Um, we're gonna get some more calls, 1-877-GAME-OLR, our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio,
7610920	7612680	and we'll get to calls in just a moment.
7612680	7616120	I don't know if, uh, Loki had any last minute stories you wanted to do real quick?
7616120	7617120	Yeah, sure.
7617120	7620200	Um, Mirror's Edge is gonna be coming to the iPhone soon.
7620200	7622360	It's a little bit different than normal Mirror's Edge.
7622360	7627440	It's actually kind of more of a side-scroll game, but it's, uh, still 3D, and it looks
7627440	7628440	neat.
7628440	7631080	Uh, hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio, who's this?
7631080	7632320	It's Ranma one more time.
7632320	7633320	Hi, Ranma, what's on your mind?
7633320	7635320	Lucky you, getting through two weeks in a row.
7635320	7636320	Not too much.
7636320	7641240	Um, couple of quick things, I'll be on my merry little way, um, first thing is, I don't
7641240	7646760	know if you saw, but I had made a retweet about President Katz coming to the US.
7646760	7647760	Uh huh.
7647760	7648760	Did you see that?
7648760	7650760	No, wait, like, for real?
7650760	7656800	Well, someone on Twitter goes, going by the name of smap454, his name is Matt Cox, made
7656800	7660520	a tweet to Ranma Wee saying that President Katz coming to the US.
7660520	7661520	Uh huh.
7661520	7666360	And I retweeted it, but it just kind of fell right in the water, so I don't know if you
7666360	7667360	guys had heard about it.
7667360	7668360	When was it?
7668360	7669360	Was it today?
7669360	7671760	No, actually, this was about three days ago.
7671760	7675360	No, I didn't see it, I've been bad on keeping current on Twitter.
7675360	7677040	Would I see it on Ranma Wee's Twitter?
7677040	7681480	Yes, and I actually have, I actually have the Twitter, um, page up, I can put it in
7681480	7687360	the chat room, and even though it makes for great radio, it's Twitter.com slash smat454.
7687360	7691960	Well, wait, now they're saying President Katz, the revolution is coming to the US, that's
7691960	7696200	just, they're just talking about the, the, the fever, President Katz fever, I don't think
7696200	7697200	they mean a game.
7697200	7700960	Because, like, yeah, if you look at a couple tweets before that, they're saying President
7700960	7704880	Katz for the win, we need President Katz, I don't think they're talking about the actual
7704880	7705880	game.
7705880	7706880	I wish.
7706880	7707880	It's probably a listener to this program.
7707880	7712040	Probably so, but when it came across to my feed, I'm automatically, assuming, so I picked
7712040	7716000	up the rights to the game, it's coming over, you know?
7716000	7717000	I wish.
7717000	7720840	If these stories about the fact that it only sold 100 copies are true, maybe it won't happen,
7720840	7724600	but, you know, again, I gotta be careful, I don't want to make this the President Katz
7724600	7728680	show, but my point still stands, this game would sell if it came out here, and it will
7728680	7730920	sell much more than 100 copies.
7730920	7733400	I mean, hell, they made a sequel to We Cheer.
7733400	7734400	I know, right?
7734400	7737920	Like, get their, and muscle, hello, Muscle March.
7737920	7738920	End of argument.
7738920	7743120	Yeah, yeah, you, yeah, you got a valid point on that one, yeah.
7743120	7744120	Exactly.
7744120	7747600	Well, anything else on your mind tonight, DJ Rama?
7747600	7748600	Something interesting.
7748600	7754560	Saturday, I called Best Buy, I had an issue about my TV set, but at the same time, my
7754560	7759280	360s acted kind of odd, so then I called them to see if I could get it replaced, which is
7759280	7760280	not a problem.
7760280	7764360	So I asked them another question, because it seems that another one of my coworkers,
7764360	7770040	he has a 360 with a two-year coverage by Best Buy, and they're refusing to take his 360
7770040	7773300	because it's the Red Ring of Death, so I asked them about that.
7773300	7778520	It seems that now, when you buy your Xbox 360 from Best Buy, you know you get the two-year
7778520	7779880	black type protection?
7779880	7781640	It does not cover the Red Ring of Death.
7781640	7786040	Now, if you already have the coverage, you're good, provided that you bought your console
7786040	7789520	before, I believe, September of 2008.
7789520	7793460	I'd actually, I want to say I've heard of this before, and it's because the Red Rings
7793460	7796220	are covered under Microsoft's warranty, and Best Buy don't want to have anything to do
7796220	7797220	with it anymore.
7797220	7800120	Well, it looks like I got lucky with my Red Ring.
7800120	7804400	Well, the thing is also, I mean, if there are anything like what we have to deal with,
7804400	7809360	Microsoft is telling us to tell our customers that they need to go through Microsoft to
7809360	7811120	get that system fixed.
7811120	7814540	So there's no point in returning it back to the place you bought it.
7814540	7818400	You need to go send it to Microsoft, because all they're going to end up doing is having
7818400	7825840	to send it back to Microsoft anyways, and really, it's the way you need to do it anyways.
7825840	7826840	True.
7826840	7831360	So the funny thing is, I mean, I used to work for them, and under this coverage, if someone
7831360	7835320	brought the console back, whatever console it was, Best Buy would still get the full
7835320	7838120	credit on it anyway, back from the manufacturer.
7838120	7841080	So that's the part that kind of threw me off for a long time.
7841080	7842080	Maybe I'm not anymore, though.
7842080	7843080	I don't know.
7843080	7844080	I don't think.
7844080	7845080	Strange.
7845080	7849480	All right, well, Rama, thank you so much for the call, and thanks for the heads up on Best
7849480	7850880	Buy, if folks didn't already know.
7850880	7853680	It's something to think about, especially this holiday season, as you're buying people
7853680	7854680	Xboxes.
7854680	7858520	The thing to think of possibly as a reason why they wouldn't take it back, too, is they
7858520	7863320	could just say, oh yeah, Red Ringed, and in reality, their console got banned.
7863320	7864320	Don't.
7864320	7868320	Yeah, because the thing is, they're supposed to pop open the consoles and test it out and
7868320	7872520	make sure Red Ringed or whatever, because that's what I did when I worked at Geeksfella,
7872520	7875120	so I brought back defective PS2s and Xboxes.
7875120	7879680	When I showed my 360 in the box, they took it, grabbed me another one off the shelf,
7879680	7882240	and I'm like, here you go.
7882240	7884960	And it was a slow day, too.
7884960	7885960	Hmm.
7885960	7886960	All right.
7886960	7890040	Well, we're going to let you go, Rama, so we can get some more calls, but thank you
7890040	7891040	guys.
7891040	7892040	No problem.
7892040	7893520	Thank you so much, as always, for calling in, OK?
7893520	7894520	And upon you.
7894520	7895520	Have a good week.
7895520	7896520	Have a good week.
7896520	7897520	You too.
7897520	7898520	All right.
7898520	7899520	877-GAME-OLR.
7899520	7902840	Our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio, and that's the place to get in on the Skype
7902840	7906120	line if you have anything you want to talk about tonight on the program.
7906120	7907560	Other last minute stories we have, Logan?
7907560	7908560	Yeah, sure.
7908560	7914120	This is a PlayStation Network game that's going to be nearly 10 gigabytes in size, and
7914120	7921880	it's the PlayStation Network title Record of Argressed War, and apparently it's a strategy
7921880	7929120	RPG, and it's coming to North America by Axis Games localization.
7929120	7933600	One of the companies I said to send the President and Cat emails to, because they localize all
7933600	7938640	sorts of weird stuff, including this game that has apparently anime chicks seductively
7938640	7940320	eating sausages.
7940320	7943920	Oh, joy and rapture.
7943920	7945640	This picture here.
7945640	7947040	Too much porn tonight.
7947040	7948040	Yeah.
7948040	7952680	I mean, I know there's no such thing as too much porn, but tonight might be pushing the
7952680	7953680	limit.
7953680	7954680	I'm just saying.
7954680	7957440	I might have to put the explicit tag on tonight's show for once.
7957440	7958880	Anyhow, we got another call.
7958880	7959880	Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio.
7959880	7960880	Who's this?
7960880	7961880	Hey, this is X-Link.
7961880	7962880	Hey, X-Link.
7962880	7963880	Hey, X-Link.
7963880	7964880	Hey, Lauren.
7964880	7965880	What are you talking about?
7965880	7966880	Clearly I'm smoking crack.
7966880	7967880	That means we're Orange Lounge Pornio.
7967880	7970920	X-Link, I'm sorry to make you wait there for a little bit, but what's in your mind?
7970920	7971920	Hey, no, no problem.
7971920	7972920	Not at all.
7972920	7977760	This has been a great show, everything from snow to boobs to flashlights.
7977760	7978760	To snowboob flashlights.
7978760	7979760	I know.
7979760	7980760	And food.
7980760	7981840	It's been an amazing night.
7981840	7984600	Well, I found a little bit of information, it was interesting.
7984600	7987360	I ran you about this before, and I told you to look this up.
7987360	7990420	I don't know if you did or not, but they were talking about Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep,
7990420	7996940	of course, is going to be hitting over in Japan on January 9th, but Jesse McCarthy on
7996940	8002860	his tweet back about November 30th put up a tweet and says, recording yet another Kingdom
8002860	8007140	Hearts game. All you gamers eat your heart out. Man, what a process, though. The first
8007140	8012260	recording was in 2005 for game one, which I think they said that actually the first
8012260	8018560	game came out in the U.S. in 2002, which then they said part two came out in 2005, but none
8018560	8022580	of the last, though, which they're talking about, hopefully that means that we will be
8022580	8027900	getting Birth by Sleep here come sometime maybe either middle of next year or possibly
8027900	8030780	the year after, so I'm definitely looking forward to that.
8030780	8034860	I'm kind of not surprised that, you know, it's making its way over here.
8034860	8038780	No, not at all, but I'm looking forward to it because it's going to add a lot of
8038780	8042740	information to the storyline, especially since it's supposed to be the prequel to what
8042740	8047540	all happened for the story, so. And it's supposedly rumors are claiming that it might
8047540	8052300	have, like, of course, all the games at the end have that little sneak peek of what's
8052300	8056180	going on. It supposedly could possibly have something for maybe, you know, part three.
8056180	8057180	So.
8057180	8060820	Let's hope. You know I'm all about the Kingdom Hearts part three, but it also makes
8060820	8064260	sense, you know, and I think this point got brought up a couple episodes ago is that that
8064260	8068820	team has been hard at work on Versus 13, which we've had very little information about,
8068820	8073060	so you know that that game is still heavy under development. I think once Versus 13
8073060	8076420	finally looks like it's nearing gold status and it's on its way out, which, honestly,
8076420	8080700	at this point, I don't think it's going to happen until 2011. I think we'll, I think
8080700	8085180	we'll have more. Because, you know, I think, here's my thought, actually, Versus 13, I
8085180	8089700	think is going to be a big thing at E3 2010 for Square. Because at that point, Final Fantasy
8089700	8094380	13, non-versus, the regular one, will be out. You know, now that we know the release date
8094380	8099200	for 13, it'll be out in Japan, it'll be out here in the U.S., that's done now. So,
8099200	8103760	I think Versus 13 will be big, and maybe they'll make a Kingdom Hearts announcement, but I
8103760	8108180	think that that's what's going to be their big thing at E3 this year, is finding more
8108180	8109180	on Versus.
8109180	8113180	I'm sorry, I don't mean to interrupt. I'm sorry. My prediction would be that the Kingdom
8113180	8117900	Hearts, and also there was, they've been showing teasers, especially over in Japan
8117900	8125060	for it, but the Parasite Eve, the third birthday, was also, been teased over in Japan, which,
8125060	8129500	of course, did very well. The first two did very well over here, I believe, in the U.S.
8129500	8132100	Yeah, surprising they never did a third one.
8132100	8136180	Well, they're supposed to, and it's supposed to be for PSP, and they already said that
8136180	8140060	it was going to come out, but there has been no release dates or anything of the, yeah,
8140060	8143980	they're just showing teasers, they had a little teaser, one or two teasers out for
8143980	8144980	that, but I'm hoping...
8144980	8146740	I still wish they'd translate the book.
8146740	8151100	I remember Parasite Eve, I remember a story that we covered on the show, like, it was
8151100	8153620	a while ago, probably about a year and a half ago, but I remember this has come up on the
8153620	8158100	show before. You know, it's, it's, it's being done, it's just, yeah, and I seem
8158100	8162620	to recall it was on the PSP, too, but it's a little weird that that's the direction
8162620	8166620	they're going with it, when they could do something, you know, epic on the PS3, but,
8166620	8172140	you know, whatever, or 360, whatever they want to do. I, I, I imagine that's something
8172140	8175260	they're going to pull out of their hat at E3. I'd be with you there.
8175260	8178180	I just, I'm just surprised to see what they will do. I mean, they're just going to try
8178180	8182780	to, you know, go for it, you know, so, if they do, that's great, if not, then...
8182780	8186900	So, alright, well, excellent, thank you so much for the call, and we're going to let
8186900	8190260	you go, so we can wrap up the show, but thank you so much, as always, and have a good night,
8190260	8191260	okay?
8191260	8192260	Of course, thanks.
8192260	8193260	Later.
8193260	8194260	See you.
8194260	8196020	That's going to do it for tonight's Skypline. Thank you so much to our callers tonight.
8196020	8200140	We really appreciate it. Sorry to those folks that didn't get through tonight, but it's
8200140	8205020	weird. Tonight's show's been moving very fast. We're actually probably going to end a little
8205020	8208080	bit earlier than usual, but you know what? It's also that time of year where the games
8208080	8212660	are out now, so there's not a whole lot of, you know, people are going to be sleeping
8212660	8216100	through December, and we'll get more game news come January, especially with all of
8216100	8220380	these postponements. I think first and second quarter 2010 are going to be very interesting.
8220380	8222020	First quarter is pretty interesting.
8222020	8226140	All these games that got delayed are finally going to come out. It's going to be very interesting.
8226140	8229020	But anyhow, we still have some last minute stories, right, Loki?
8229020	8233960	Yeah, and then, other than Mirror's Edge, there's also some other decent games coming
8233960	8244220	to the iPhone, including iPhone, the iPhone version of Ace Combat 11, or XI, I guess.
8244220	8249940	It's coming from Namco, of course. It looks pretty awesome. And they're also updating,
8249940	8255420	I guess, Guarders and Ghouls, no relation to Ghosts and Goblins.
8255420	8258540	I was going to say, that's what it sounds like. Is that like Ghosts and Goblins?
8258540	8263860	It's a zombie killing game, and it allows you, they're going to have GPS support now,
8263860	8268380	so you can move your iPhone around to turn your player in the game.
8268380	8274380	Deft wants to point out that's Ace Combat She, not XI, because Ace Combat 6 was the
8274380	8276060	last one, so they wouldn't jump right to XI.
8276060	8281780	Yeah, but you never. Okay, so She. And let's see, what else? So Serious Sam, the second
8281780	8285420	encounter, is also getting the HD treatment as well. And if I remember correctly, the
8285420	8293740	first one still hasn't come out yet, but still, that's kind of neat. So I'm assuming coming
8293740	8301340	to the same places as the first game, probably Steam, PlayStation Network, and Xbox Live
8301340	8303340	Arcade.
8303340	8313860	And then finally, Lips Party Classics will be coming out on the Xbox 360 in 2010, apparently
8313860	8321820	in the spring. It will feature 40 new tracks, including the Love Shack by the B-52s, Tub
8321820	8327820	Thumping by Chubba Wumba, I Will Survive by Gloria Gaynor, Rock and Roll All Night by
8327820	8334420	KISS, Wannabe by Spice Girls, I Think We're Alone Now by Tiffany, and YMCA by the Village
8334420	8343420	People. And of course, you know, your typical karaoke game.
8343420	8350600	And then finally, to kind of elaborate a little bit more on what the Record of Argos War was,
8350600	8355620	it's a game that had that soul breed function in there. Basically, you find these women
8355620	8361620	and you breed with them to create a new hero.
8361620	8362980	Okay.
8362980	8363980	I'm bringing it back around.
8363980	8365980	I see, yes.
8365980	8366980	I see.
8366980	8367980	Yeah.
8367980	8368980	Uh-huh.
8368980	8373980	That's why she was seductively eating the sausage. It all makes sense now.
8373980	8379140	Dot dot dot.
8379140	8381140	That's all I've got.
8381140	8388300	All right. Anyhow, we're going to wrap up here at Orange Lawns Radio and say goodnight
8388300	8393860	and all that fun stuff. DarkSakura, your final thought tonight?
8393860	8394860	My hands hurt.
8394860	8395860	Sorry to hear that.
8395860	8397500	Damn hat.
8397500	8400580	My hands don't hurt.
8400580	8404340	My final thought is, I want a taco. That's my final thought. I think that was my final
8404340	8407940	thought last week, but I again want a taco, just so you know. That's going to do it for
8407940	8410580	another episode of Orange Lawns Radio. Believe it or not, we're coming to a close. I know
8410580	8413740	it's a little early tonight, but like I said, it's a little bit of a slower news week. Not
8413740	8417200	as much to discuss as usual. Live listeners though, stay tuned because we have a little
8417200	8420380	extra something after the show as usual. For those of you guys listening on the podcast
8420380	8423500	though, that's going to do it. Thank you guys so much for downloading and supporting our
8423500	8427180	program. We really appreciate it. Again, all we ask, we do this stuff for free, so please
8427180	8430860	tell two people about the show. I know especially ever since the launch of the Facebook page,
8430860	8434460	a lot of you guys have really been selling the show to your friends. We really appreciate
8434460	8439220	that and the word of mouth goes a very long way. Just want to let you guys know it's really
8439220	8443460	appreciated because we don't really have advertising dollars. We don't have a big magazine supporting
8443460	8448740	us. We're not on TV or anything fancy like that. Word of mouth is all we got, so we really
8448740	8453660	appreciate it. If you didn't like our program, that's okay. We don't hate you that much,
8453660	8456760	but do check out some of the other programs on AllGames.com, some other great independent
8456760	8460640	podcasts that talk about other things. If you don't like us because we don't talk enough
8460640	8464420	modern warfare, there's a show on there that talks much more about first person shooters
8464420	8469900	or whatever might be up your alley. So thank you guys, of course, as always, and we'll
8469900	8474700	do it all again next week. Except remember guys, next week, sadly, not live, but it will
8474700	8479700	be pre-taped. If we can pre-tape it live, stay tuned to the Twitter and the Facebook
8479700	8483420	for all that information. Meanwhile, that's going to do it for another additional Orange
8483420	8490420	Lounge Radio. Till next week, I'm Rob Roberts, she's DarkSakura, he's Loki, and we're out!
8513420	8520420	See you next week!
