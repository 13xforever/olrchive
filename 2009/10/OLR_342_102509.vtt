00:00.000 --> 00:14.000
Music

00:14.000 --> 00:19.000
Tonight, October 25th, 2009, a major new score burns computer games while you wait.

00:19.000 --> 00:22.000
We have an interview about the upcoming charity event, Ooh Loud,

00:22.000 --> 00:27.000
and some crappy little podcast once an obscure Japanese title released in the US.

00:27.000 --> 00:34.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:34.000 --> 00:51.000
Music

00:51.000 --> 00:53.000
Heard any good jokes lately?

00:53.000 --> 00:57.000
Hi, and welcome to another edition of Orange Lounge Radio.

00:57.000 --> 01:05.000
That's a podcast dedicated to video games, video gaming, gamer lifestyle, and of course, kittens!

01:05.000 --> 01:11.000
Cute, adorable, fluffy kittens.

01:11.000 --> 01:14.000
My name is Rob Roberts, joining you for the next few hours.

01:14.000 --> 01:19.000
Of course, as with me as always, say hello to the one and only secretary of catnip,

01:19.000 --> 01:22.000
Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.

01:22.000 --> 01:28.000
And of course, the one and only secretary of defense, Techmaster Loki.

01:28.000 --> 01:29.000
Hello.

01:29.000 --> 01:30.000
He cleans the cat box.

01:30.000 --> 01:32.000
I do.

01:32.000 --> 01:34.000
How are you guys doing tonight?

01:34.000 --> 01:36.000
It's been an interesting week.

01:36.000 --> 01:38.000
Been a very interesting week.

01:38.000 --> 01:40.000
It's been a unique week.

01:40.000 --> 01:42.000
It's been a very unique week here at Orange Lounge Radio.

01:42.000 --> 01:45.000
I have to say, in the seven and a half years we've been doing Orange Lounge Radio,

01:45.000 --> 01:47.000
I haven't quite seen anything like it.

01:47.000 --> 01:51.000
Usually at Orange Lounge Radio, we start off the show talking about our gaming weeks,

01:51.000 --> 01:55.000
but in spite of things going on, we thought we might change that up a little bit

01:55.000 --> 01:57.000
and start off tonight with some news.

01:57.000 --> 02:00.000
And we're going to head over to Joystiq with a Q.

02:00.000 --> 02:02.000
Of course, we like them over at Joystiq.

02:02.000 --> 02:04.000
They run lots of fun little game stories.

02:04.000 --> 02:06.000
They ran a story this week.

02:06.000 --> 02:09.000
Fans campaigning for President Cat.

02:09.000 --> 02:10.000
I love that picture.

02:10.000 --> 02:14.000
Against all odds, a completely random Japanese Wii game starring a cat blogger

02:14.000 --> 02:17.000
has become a hot topic among some fans.

02:17.000 --> 02:23.000
Sukiban Sachurena Wii stars a cat named Rena from a popular Japanese blog

02:23.000 --> 02:25.000
as the CEO of Cat Queen, Inc.

02:25.000 --> 02:28.000
You play as a cat going through the initiation into the company,

02:28.000 --> 02:30.000
performing various minigames to earn Rena's respect.

02:30.000 --> 02:31.000
That's not really true.

02:31.000 --> 02:32.000
Oh, really?

02:32.000 --> 02:33.000
You don't play a cat.

02:33.000 --> 02:34.000
Oh, what?

02:34.000 --> 02:35.000
You play a person.

02:35.000 --> 02:36.000
Oh, really now?

02:36.000 --> 02:37.000
Yes.

02:37.000 --> 02:38.000
How do you know this?

02:38.000 --> 02:39.000
Because you see the person in the game that you're playing.

02:39.000 --> 02:40.000
You dodge flying cats.

02:40.000 --> 02:41.000
I see.

02:41.000 --> 02:44.000
The Orange Lounge Radio podcast discovered the game,

02:44.000 --> 02:46.000
which they have dubbed President Cat.

02:46.000 --> 02:48.000
I like that, that we just dubbed it that.

02:48.000 --> 02:49.000
Hey, they like it.

02:49.000 --> 02:52.000
I shall call it President Cat.

02:52.000 --> 02:53.000
Hey, they like it.

02:53.000 --> 02:54.000
They did.

02:54.000 --> 02:57.000
Then began tweeting the Wii game's official account.

02:57.000 --> 03:00.000
Fans started sending messages of encouragement and support

03:00.000 --> 03:02.000
to the President Cat hashtag,

03:02.000 --> 03:05.000
and the Rena account has started responding in both Japanese and English,

03:05.000 --> 03:09.000
revealing that the publisher is excited and a little confused

03:09.000 --> 03:11.000
about all this sudden attention.

03:11.000 --> 03:15.000
It would be hilarious if this grassroots movement resulted in the localization

03:15.000 --> 03:18.000
of a weird licensed game.

03:18.000 --> 03:22.000
However, it would also be pretty sad if the publisher turned out to lose money on it.

03:22.000 --> 03:24.000
It's definitely something we want to play,

03:24.000 --> 03:27.000
but we're not exactly representative of the mainstream audience.

03:27.000 --> 03:33.000
That story coming from J.C. Fletcher over at Joystick.

03:33.000 --> 03:36.000
I want to dodge flying cats.

03:36.000 --> 03:39.000
Obviously, we're a little surprised, probably like most people,

03:39.000 --> 03:42.000
that this actually made game blogs this week.

03:42.000 --> 03:45.000
A number of them.

03:45.000 --> 03:48.000
Some people might think it was a grab for attention,

03:48.000 --> 03:49.000
but no, please.

03:49.000 --> 03:52.000
We've done far worse desperate cries for attention on this show in the past.

03:52.000 --> 03:53.000
This was nothing.

03:53.000 --> 03:58.000
What's also interesting about this is that it's not like this is the first game

03:58.000 --> 04:00.000
we've ever said they should bring over from Japan.

04:00.000 --> 04:04.000
This is the first one that we've actually contacted the company roundaboutly.

04:04.000 --> 04:05.000
Kind of.

04:05.000 --> 04:08.000
Think about what the show was based on, what we started the show on.

04:08.000 --> 04:09.000
DDR, right?

04:09.000 --> 04:10.000
Yeah.

04:10.000 --> 04:15.000
How long did it take for DDR to finally come from Japan to the U.S.?

04:15.000 --> 04:16.000
Did we have Twitter back then?

04:16.000 --> 04:17.000
No, we didn't.

04:17.000 --> 04:18.000
So?

04:18.000 --> 04:21.000
Yeah, so certainly Twitter's changed things up a little bit.

04:21.000 --> 04:24.000
You know, and all the obscure Japanese title we talked about in the past.

04:24.000 --> 04:25.000
So it's interesting, you know,

04:25.000 --> 04:30.000
and I understand why Joystick is saying what they do at the end there.

04:30.000 --> 04:32.000
They have to kind of show both ends of the story that, you know,

04:32.000 --> 04:34.000
well, it would be a darn shame if they localized this game

04:34.000 --> 04:35.000
and it ended up in bargain bins.

04:35.000 --> 04:40.000
But dude, the fact that you guys ran the article as well as a variety

04:40.000 --> 04:42.000
of other sites ran the article.

04:42.000 --> 04:44.000
Like Go Nintendo and Destructoid.

04:44.000 --> 04:48.000
Means that people obviously saw something in it, I think.

04:48.000 --> 04:52.000
You know, that wasn't in some of the games we talked about in the past.

04:52.000 --> 04:53.000
And so it's very interesting.

04:53.000 --> 04:56.000
It just goes to show the moral of the story.

04:56.000 --> 04:58.000
America...

04:58.000 --> 04:59.000
Loves cats.

04:59.000 --> 05:00.000
Loves cats.

05:00.000 --> 05:04.000
And I'm not, when I say America, I mean collectively the world

05:04.000 --> 05:07.000
that listens to this show, we just happen to be in America.

05:07.000 --> 05:11.000
But, you know, our friends in Australia, Canada, Mexico, Europe,

05:11.000 --> 05:13.000
they all fucking love cats too.

05:13.000 --> 05:18.000
And I think it just goes to show that people would like to see a game like this.

05:18.000 --> 05:20.000
Not everybody wants to see a game like this.

05:20.000 --> 05:22.000
Of course, you look at the comments on this and, you know,

05:22.000 --> 05:24.000
the other sites that ran the article and there's people saying,

05:24.000 --> 05:26.000
this game looks stupid.

05:26.000 --> 05:28.000
Yeah, they probably also like Madden.

05:28.000 --> 05:32.000
And my point would be there are some people that look at games like Madden

05:32.000 --> 05:34.000
and go, well, that's stupid.

05:34.000 --> 05:36.000
Like me. I go a lot stupid to Madden.

05:36.000 --> 05:38.000
I don't think Madden is stupid.

05:38.000 --> 05:40.000
I just, it's not my kind of game.

05:40.000 --> 05:41.000
I think it's a waste of my time.

05:41.000 --> 05:44.000
But I bet there are people out there that would say Uncharted 2 is stupid.

05:44.000 --> 05:49.000
This game that gets critical praise, lavish, left and right upon it.

05:49.000 --> 05:50.000
Somebody thinks it's stupid.

05:50.000 --> 05:53.000
I don't, but, you know, somebody out there probably does.

05:53.000 --> 05:54.000
I will say it's stupid.

05:54.000 --> 05:55.000
You haven't even played it.

05:55.000 --> 05:56.000
No, I haven't.

05:56.000 --> 05:57.000
You just want to be controversial.

05:57.000 --> 05:58.000
I know.

05:58.000 --> 06:01.000
See, that's that desperate cry for attention people talk about.

06:01.000 --> 06:02.000
It's not.

06:02.000 --> 06:05.000
I am unique just like everyone else.

06:05.000 --> 06:07.000
So here's the thing, though.

06:07.000 --> 06:13.000
The point behind this, and if you go back on the show weeks and weeks,

06:13.000 --> 06:15.000
years and years, months and months, whatever,

06:15.000 --> 06:17.000
we've talked about this for a long time.

06:17.000 --> 06:20.000
It has to do with risk taking.

06:20.000 --> 06:24.000
For example, Konami really missed the boat when it came to making guitar

06:24.000 --> 06:26.000
games in the U.S., didn't they?

06:26.000 --> 06:27.000
Oh, hell yeah.

06:27.000 --> 06:30.000
They had a guitar and drum game out for years and years in Japan

06:30.000 --> 06:32.000
that they could have released over here.

06:32.000 --> 06:35.000
But when they did it, they did a half-assed job with it.

06:35.000 --> 06:37.000
And same thing goes for Beatmania is that, you know,

06:37.000 --> 06:41.000
they transferred everything in Japan, kind of figuring it would work over here,

06:41.000 --> 06:44.000
didn't really invest a lot of time or money into it.

06:44.000 --> 06:47.000
And so they didn't really take a big risk.

06:47.000 --> 06:50.000
I mean, sure, they, I guess, took a little risk in putting the game out

06:50.000 --> 06:52.000
over here, which paid off for them with DDR.

06:52.000 --> 06:53.000
Yeah.

06:53.000 --> 06:54.000
You know.

06:54.000 --> 06:55.000
Beatmania, not so much.

06:55.000 --> 07:00.000
But a lot of Japanese companies, I think, are afraid to take risks sometimes

07:00.000 --> 07:05.000
because they think Americans don't get it or we're not going to get it.

07:05.000 --> 07:08.000
Well, let this past week be a lesson.

07:08.000 --> 07:12.000
There's a lot of people over here that get it,

07:12.000 --> 07:15.000
or else this story would have, nobody would have cared,

07:15.000 --> 07:18.000
just like the past other hundred games we've talked about on the show

07:18.000 --> 07:20.000
that should be over here.

07:20.000 --> 07:24.000
I'm thinking about doing a Sharmi blog as tribute.

07:24.000 --> 07:26.000
So, I don't know, Loki, what are your thoughts on this whole thing?

07:26.000 --> 07:28.000
You actually got the game this week, right?

07:28.000 --> 07:29.000
Yes, I did.

07:29.000 --> 07:30.000
And what did you think?

07:30.000 --> 07:32.000
Is it worth all our hype?

07:32.000 --> 07:35.000
Did this get out of hand, what?

07:35.000 --> 07:38.000
Well, I don't know, it may have gotten out of hand a little bit,

07:38.000 --> 07:42.000
but it's a fun game, from what I can understand.

07:42.000 --> 07:46.000
Obviously, I don't get a lot of the stuff that's going on in the game

07:46.000 --> 07:49.000
because it's all in Japanese, but the little mini-games in there are fun,

07:49.000 --> 07:53.000
and it's funny to watch them, and it's just weird.

07:53.000 --> 07:56.000
So, it's got that kind of appeal, and I think it'd be a little bit better

07:56.000 --> 07:57.000
if it was in English.

07:57.000 --> 07:59.000
How much of it is spoken?

07:59.000 --> 08:01.000
There's a lot of it. Well, it's not really spoken,

08:01.000 --> 08:04.000
it's just kind of in text boxes.

08:04.000 --> 08:05.000
Oh.

08:05.000 --> 08:09.000
But, you know, it's fun.

08:09.000 --> 08:12.000
Definitely would pick it up if it came out over here.

08:12.000 --> 08:15.000
And, you know, as I posted in Twitter and stuff,

08:15.000 --> 08:18.000
there's been a few other cat games that have come out over here,

08:18.000 --> 08:20.000
more like the cat-raising systems, like, you know,

08:20.000 --> 08:23.000
the dog's kind of crap.

08:23.000 --> 08:26.000
Imagine cats, and they also have purr pals and stuff like that.

08:26.000 --> 08:30.000
And you have to understand, even though a lot of people

08:30.000 --> 08:33.000
don't get these kind of games on the Wii,

08:33.000 --> 08:36.000
the Wii has so many units out there, it doesn't matter.

08:36.000 --> 08:39.000
It takes such a small percentage of the people out there

08:39.000 --> 08:41.000
to sell a lot of units of this.

08:41.000 --> 08:43.000
For example, those other cat games.

08:43.000 --> 08:46.000
200,000 units and 400,000 units.

08:46.000 --> 08:49.000
And they were shit. They were absolute shit.

08:49.000 --> 08:52.000
But people will buy anything that comes out on the Wii.

08:52.000 --> 08:55.000
And if you put President Cat on the front of that box,

08:55.000 --> 08:58.000
you better believe that hundreds of thousands of people

08:58.000 --> 09:02.000
will pick up the game, even if it completely stunk.

09:02.000 --> 09:05.000
Which is good because this game doesn't stink,

09:05.000 --> 09:09.000
but, you know, it's quirky and it's fun and it's got minigames in it,

09:09.000 --> 09:12.000
and trust me, there's so many minigame collections,

09:12.000 --> 09:15.000
party games out there, it'll fit right in.

09:15.000 --> 09:18.000
What do you think is the fear about putting a game like this

09:18.000 --> 09:20.000
out in the US?

09:20.000 --> 09:23.000
I mean, clearly the developers behind this game, who granted,

09:23.000 --> 09:25.000
we blindsided a little bit last week,

09:25.000 --> 09:27.000
but we kind of never thought they'd care.

09:27.000 --> 09:30.000
So it's kind of really cool that they actually responded in the first place,

09:30.000 --> 09:34.000
and I think speaks very highly of the company in the first place,

09:34.000 --> 09:35.000
you know, despite all this.

09:35.000 --> 09:37.000
But what do you think is the fear?

09:37.000 --> 09:40.000
I mean, there's plenty. We read off Japanese releases every week,

09:40.000 --> 09:42.000
and many of them don't come over here.

09:42.000 --> 09:45.000
Why do you think? Do they just think we don't get it?

09:45.000 --> 09:47.000
It's just not the kind of game that would do well here?

09:47.000 --> 09:49.000
What is the fear?

09:49.000 --> 09:52.000
I think that it's just a lot of money that goes into localizing the game,

09:52.000 --> 09:55.000
and if they don't feel that they're going to sell enough units,

09:55.000 --> 09:58.000
then they're just not going to bother with it.

09:58.000 --> 10:03.000
But then I look at companies like Atlus, or even Axis game localization,

10:03.000 --> 10:06.000
or even Ignition, whatever.

10:06.000 --> 10:08.000
I mean, a lot of their games that come out over here

10:08.000 --> 10:12.000
that they decided to put out on the Wii, or even the DS and stuff,

10:12.000 --> 10:14.000
don't sell that many units.

10:14.000 --> 10:19.000
Atlus especially, they don't sell a lot of units, maybe 200,000 on a good title,

10:19.000 --> 10:22.000
and they only have a limited run.

10:22.000 --> 10:24.000
They really cut their budget that way.

10:24.000 --> 10:28.000
But I think that something like this, given the right marketing behind it,

10:28.000 --> 10:31.000
and I'm sure there would be a lot of praise for it,

10:31.000 --> 10:33.000
I think it would do pretty well.

10:33.000 --> 10:38.000
And when you consider these games like Pets Cats 2 and Purrpals,

10:38.000 --> 10:41.000
they have no marketing. They have zero marketing.

10:41.000 --> 10:46.000
And all you're getting, people are seeing these in the stores,

10:46.000 --> 10:49.000
and they're picking it up based on the cute kitten that's on the front cover.

10:49.000 --> 10:51.000
That's it.

10:51.000 --> 10:54.000
Because they're, oh, my daughter likes cat games, so they'll pick it up.

10:54.000 --> 10:59.000
And if it's a quirky, weird cat game, it's cute, and it's got fun games in it.

10:59.000 --> 11:01.000
I think it's even better.

11:01.000 --> 11:04.000
Let's go to the chat room, our always present other guests here on the program,

11:04.000 --> 11:05.000
chat.orangetonshooter.com.

11:05.000 --> 11:07.000
Dark Tetsuya in chat asks,

11:07.000 --> 11:09.000
yeah, who would we contact about localizing this, if anyone?

11:09.000 --> 11:12.000
And this kind of, you know, leading into the next question,

11:12.000 --> 11:15.000
what happens from here with our little mission to get this game localized?

11:15.000 --> 11:17.000
I have a thought, but go ahead.

11:17.000 --> 11:23.000
I would contact kind of the usual bunch of people that are out there

11:23.000 --> 11:25.000
localizing weird-ass games.

11:25.000 --> 11:28.000
I mean, there's a few companies out there that will do that.

11:28.000 --> 11:31.000
One example would be UFO Interactive.

11:31.000 --> 11:36.000
They localize a lot of shoot-em-up games, like shmup games,

11:36.000 --> 11:39.000
bullet hell stuff, and a lot of other weird stuff,

11:39.000 --> 11:41.000
plus they have their own games that they actually put out as well,

11:41.000 --> 11:44.000
but they do a lot of localization in that sense,

11:44.000 --> 11:48.000
and it's a lot of stuff that I know that their stuff is not selling that many units,

11:48.000 --> 11:51.000
but I guess they're picking these properties cheap enough

11:51.000 --> 11:54.000
or something that they decide, you know, that it's worth putting it out.

11:54.000 --> 12:00.000
Like they put out, I forget if it was like Go Minion or something like that.

12:00.000 --> 12:03.000
It ended up coming out as Domino Rally over here or something like that.

12:03.000 --> 12:05.000
It's like Go Go Minion I think was the name of it.

12:05.000 --> 12:09.000
You know, that's a really obscure title, but they went ahead and brought it over here.

12:09.000 --> 12:12.000
Axis Game Localization does the same stuff.

12:12.000 --> 12:14.000
They've been doing a little bit more mainstream stuff lately.

12:14.000 --> 12:17.000
They've been doing the Guilty Gear series, a lot of stuff from that.

12:17.000 --> 12:19.000
But there's a few other things that they bring over.

12:19.000 --> 12:21.000
Then if you want to talk to other publishers,

12:21.000 --> 12:26.000
there's Zoo Games that brings out a lot of like, you know, kind of bargain bin stuff.

12:26.000 --> 12:30.000
They do a lot of localization for UK games that get released over there,

12:30.000 --> 12:34.000
but they're willing to bring over properties that no one has any idea what the hell they are over here,

12:34.000 --> 12:40.000
like Kokoto, which is some sort of demon character that's popular I guess in the UK or something.

12:40.000 --> 12:44.000
So should our listeners that feel passionate about the game email these guys, tweet them?

12:44.000 --> 12:48.000
No, I think it'd be a good idea to maybe bring it up to maybe,

12:48.000 --> 12:54.000
I would go with like UFO Interactive and maybe Triaxis, maybe even like D3 or something,

12:54.000 --> 12:59.000
because remember D3, they brought over Defense Force, which is sweet and weird.

12:59.000 --> 13:06.000
Only Shambara, plus they have a simple series in Japan, so they're used to weird ass games,

13:06.000 --> 13:12.000
but it's just, I don't know, it couldn't hurt to hit up more people than less.

13:12.000 --> 13:17.000
In a way, I think our quirky little mission has succeeded big already.

13:17.000 --> 13:21.000
I mean obviously this was just kind of like a running joke last week,

13:21.000 --> 13:25.000
and I don't want to say it's a joke, because I mean there's a lot of truth to it.

13:25.000 --> 13:28.000
Obviously it's something that kind of got like way bigger than we ever thought.

13:28.000 --> 13:32.000
I mean with them responding and what have you, but in a way I think it already succeeded.

13:32.000 --> 13:37.000
Having hit all the game blogs, having, I mean, let's face it, the developers' Twitter,

13:37.000 --> 13:42.000
their numbers of followers has doubled, damn near tripled since everything happened last week.

13:42.000 --> 13:46.000
You know, and I think in that regard, I think it already got the point across in regards to,

13:46.000 --> 13:49.000
hey, there's an audience over here for this kind of like quirky stuff.

13:49.000 --> 13:53.000
If you don't think game developers have already noticed when, you know,

13:53.000 --> 13:56.000
several major, major gaming blogs picked up the story.

13:56.000 --> 14:01.000
Yeah, and really what it came down to is what are these, what kind of units are they looking to sell?

14:01.000 --> 14:03.000
What would make it worthwhile for them to bring it over here?

14:03.000 --> 14:05.000
I mean obviously something like this is not going to sell a million units.

14:05.000 --> 14:08.000
I mean it's not going to be, I don't think it's going to be the next Katamari.

14:08.000 --> 14:09.000
I mean it's not.

14:09.000 --> 14:12.000
They didn't think the Katamari was going to be the next Katamari.

14:12.000 --> 14:16.000
Actually it's good you bring that up, but keep in mind Katamari Damacy was a big risk too.

14:16.000 --> 14:19.000
That game was released for 20 bucks several years ago.

14:19.000 --> 14:23.000
And it was weird, and everyone loved it because it was different.

14:23.000 --> 14:27.000
I want to read this comment, and I don't know if you have anything else you want to say on this Dark Sakura,

14:27.000 --> 14:29.000
but another comment from chat, Bochikawa in chat,

14:29.000 --> 14:33.000
Skye, the best jokes are those that we all can relate to,

14:33.000 --> 14:36.000
and I think you hit the nail on the head there.

14:36.000 --> 14:40.000
Again, this is not the first game we've screamed from the mountain tops,

14:40.000 --> 14:42.000
has ought to be localized and brought over here.

14:42.000 --> 14:46.000
Keep in mind, this show started as a music game based show,

14:46.000 --> 14:50.000
and we have screamed at the top of our lungs about tons and tons of music games

14:50.000 --> 14:51.000
since the very beginning of this.

14:51.000 --> 14:56.000
But for some reason, this one got people's attention.

14:56.000 --> 14:59.000
And it's part the Twitter thing.

14:59.000 --> 15:01.000
I think that speaks for me about Twitter.

15:01.000 --> 15:02.000
It's part the Twitter thing.

15:02.000 --> 15:04.000
But I think it's part the fact that people looked at this and went,

15:04.000 --> 15:06.000
oh my God, this does look really cute.

15:06.000 --> 15:11.000
Why isn't there like a lolcats game with this as big as, you know,

15:11.000 --> 15:13.000
maybe that wasn't the point behind this game,

15:13.000 --> 15:15.000
but that's what a lot of us are kind of interpreting it as,

15:15.000 --> 15:17.000
is cats in funny situations, cat wearing cat masks,

15:17.000 --> 15:21.000
and the whole like stealing money game I saw a video of with the cats,

15:21.000 --> 15:23.000
and the cat driving the car.

15:23.000 --> 15:30.000
It is ridiculous and preposterous like lolcats and fun, fun, fun.

15:30.000 --> 15:34.000
I think that the best kind of fun is the ones you don't expect to be fun.

15:34.000 --> 15:35.000
You know, the ones that surprise you.

15:35.000 --> 15:38.000
I played the cat dodging game about ten times.

15:38.000 --> 15:39.000
It's fun.

15:39.000 --> 15:41.000
It's just ridiculous and weird.

15:41.000 --> 15:43.000
And it's fun because there's like, you know,

15:43.000 --> 15:45.000
you have to dodge a cat and then there's cats that will jump out

15:45.000 --> 15:46.000
with like hearts above their heads.

15:46.000 --> 15:50.000
You have to expand your arms out to catch the cat in a loving embrace.

15:50.000 --> 15:55.000
And it does it in this really weird like slow motion cut scene with,

15:55.000 --> 15:57.000
you know, like roses and all sorts of stuff.

15:57.000 --> 15:59.000
It's weird, but it's funny.

15:59.000 --> 16:03.000
I got to read this comment from actdeft in our chat room,

16:03.000 --> 16:05.000
and who says that Twitter is useless?

16:05.000 --> 16:07.000
I did two weeks ago.

16:07.000 --> 16:10.000
I was actually listening to the show before last week's show,

16:10.000 --> 16:13.000
and I had said I was done and fed up with Twitter,

16:13.000 --> 16:14.000
and I didn't get the point.

16:14.000 --> 16:16.000
Boy, did I get told.

16:16.000 --> 16:18.000
Well, didn't I tell you, you know,

16:18.000 --> 16:21.000
that I've done some of my best networking through Twitter.

16:21.000 --> 16:25.000
And, you know, I've gotten a little bit of work through Twitter.

16:25.000 --> 16:28.000
You know, it really is super useful.

16:28.000 --> 16:32.000
And especially, you know, right now it greatly served our purpose.

16:32.000 --> 16:33.000
You know.

16:33.000 --> 16:35.000
What is our purpose?

16:35.000 --> 16:37.000
Whatever we determine it is at the time.

16:37.000 --> 16:42.000
No, I think our purpose was to show that more Japanese developers

16:42.000 --> 16:44.000
should think about bringing their quirky little games over here,

16:44.000 --> 16:45.000
because there's an audience for it.

16:45.000 --> 16:46.000
I mean, shoot.

16:46.000 --> 16:48.000
Where was it that we would always go to at E3?

16:48.000 --> 16:50.000
We would go to the small little developers,

16:50.000 --> 16:52.000
to the ones that were looking.

16:52.000 --> 16:53.000
Kensha Frickin' Hall.

16:53.000 --> 16:56.000
Or the back corner where Natsume had their little walk around

16:56.000 --> 16:58.000
thinking you could get, like,

16:58.000 --> 17:01.000
my sheep is right over there, my Harvest Moon sheep.

17:01.000 --> 17:03.000
You know.

17:03.000 --> 17:06.000
And also I was thinking, you know,

17:06.000 --> 17:10.000
Matt made some good suggestions,

17:10.000 --> 17:12.000
but I think also look for that company,

17:12.000 --> 17:17.000
see if they've released any other games that have been released in the US

17:17.000 --> 17:20.000
and see who their marketer was.

17:20.000 --> 17:23.000
But certainly, though, after the antics of last week,

17:23.000 --> 17:27.000
you know in a boardroom somewhere in Japan this got brought up.

17:27.000 --> 17:29.000
We're going to this crazy guy, Gene.

17:29.000 --> 17:31.000
It's just very interesting.

17:31.000 --> 17:32.000
I've got one more question for Loki,

17:32.000 --> 17:34.000
and then we're going to get into how was your gaming week

17:34.000 --> 17:36.000
and the way we usually start off the show.

17:36.000 --> 17:40.000
Loki, what I'm really curious about, what did the wife think?

17:40.000 --> 17:42.000
She thought it was weird.

17:42.000 --> 17:44.000
I don't know.

17:44.000 --> 17:47.000
She didn't really pay attention because I stopped playing it

17:47.000 --> 17:50.000
because she got tired because I can't read any of the text,

17:50.000 --> 17:52.000
and there's a lot of dialogue in the game.

17:52.000 --> 17:54.000
And every time you progress the text forward,

17:54.000 --> 17:56.000
it makes a bing sound.

17:56.000 --> 17:58.000
So I was clicking, and it's all bing, bing, bing, bing, bing, bing.

17:58.000 --> 18:01.000
She's like, stop that. That's annoying.

18:01.000 --> 18:03.000
So that was pretty much...

18:03.000 --> 18:07.000
For you to be developers when you localize this, a little less bing.

18:07.000 --> 18:09.000
How about a cute meow noise instead of a bing?

18:09.000 --> 18:11.000
Something I actually noticed from the screenshots

18:11.000 --> 18:14.000
is that it's actually in very simple Japanese.

18:14.000 --> 18:16.000
But part of the reason I was wondering

18:16.000 --> 18:19.000
is how much of it was actually spoken dialogue

18:19.000 --> 18:21.000
is because it would be much easier to follow if it's spoken.

18:21.000 --> 18:22.000
There wasn't really any spoken.

18:22.000 --> 18:25.000
There was a lot of meows and lots of text boxes.

18:25.000 --> 18:28.000
What's also interesting, I've been looking on Twitter,

18:28.000 --> 18:30.000
and quite a few people on Twitter have been talking about

18:30.000 --> 18:32.000
how they got the game from Play Asia and so on.

18:32.000 --> 18:36.000
So oddly enough, our little crusade ended up increasing the sales in Japan,

18:36.000 --> 18:37.000
even if by a little bit.

18:37.000 --> 18:40.000
So you're welcome for the free advertising.

18:40.000 --> 18:43.000
I want someone to get the game for me.

18:43.000 --> 18:44.000
All right.

18:44.000 --> 18:45.000
I will render services.

18:45.000 --> 18:48.000
Any other thoughts on President Cat for now?

18:48.000 --> 18:50.000
I don't know if there's anything left to say.

18:50.000 --> 18:52.000
In a way, I kind of think our mission was successful.

18:52.000 --> 18:55.000
I don't know if there's a lot else that can be done.

18:55.000 --> 18:57.000
Ultimately, it's out of our hands at this point,

18:57.000 --> 18:59.000
and it is who's going to take a risk.

18:59.000 --> 19:00.000
We can keep the awareness up.

19:00.000 --> 19:02.000
I think we can keep the awareness up,

19:02.000 --> 19:04.000
and we can alert the potential risk takers.

19:04.000 --> 19:06.000
Keep that hashtag going.

19:06.000 --> 19:07.000
Yeah, keep the hashtag going.

19:07.000 --> 19:09.000
Tweet the companies that you think ought to bring it over,

19:09.000 --> 19:12.000
and who knows what may happen.

19:12.000 --> 19:15.000
Especially those of you that felt the need to email,

19:15.000 --> 19:16.000
because I know this could act deft.

19:16.000 --> 19:18.000
They'd thank at the bottom of the Joystick article,

19:18.000 --> 19:20.000
so I know this came from tips from listeners,

19:20.000 --> 19:22.000
these various game blogs around the story.

19:22.000 --> 19:26.000
Now that we've got that, I guess,

19:26.000 --> 19:29.000
start emailing some of the developers and see what happens.

19:29.000 --> 19:31.000
I mean, the worst that happens, they're going to delete it.

19:31.000 --> 19:36.000
Actually, I got their email address, the people over there.

19:36.000 --> 19:39.000
I've just been trying to get a hold of one of my friends in Japan

19:39.000 --> 19:42.000
to translate it for me, and she's been less than forthcoming

19:42.000 --> 19:45.000
because she has a mutual friend is over there visiting,

19:45.000 --> 19:48.000
so I might see if any of our Japanese listeners

19:48.000 --> 19:52.000
who's really good with your translation let me know,

19:52.000 --> 19:57.000
because I wanted to let them know exactly how we came across them.

19:57.000 --> 20:02.000
So shoot an email at the mailbag, and we'll work together.

20:02.000 --> 20:07.000
There may be some lucrative opportunity for you.

20:07.000 --> 20:10.000
All right. Well, let's get back into our regular show here.

20:10.000 --> 20:13.000
Obviously, we've taken a 20-minute detour to talk about President Cap,

20:13.000 --> 20:17.000
but that kind of thing happens when we tend to get spotlighted for a week

20:17.000 --> 20:18.000
for whatever reason.

20:18.000 --> 20:20.000
We're going to move into our regular show now.

20:20.000 --> 20:22.000
Our ego's full, and we turn into Big Divas.

20:22.000 --> 20:25.000
Basically. Hey, wait a minute. What is this?

20:25.000 --> 20:29.000
I asked for a Diet Coke. What is this? Anyway.

20:29.000 --> 20:34.000
I'm sorry. I wanted 2% milk in my latte. Hi.

20:34.000 --> 20:35.000
I peed in your latte.

20:35.000 --> 20:36.000
You're a butt.

20:36.000 --> 20:38.000
We're going to get into how was your gaming week.

20:38.000 --> 20:40.000
We always like to start off the show with a little bit of that,

20:40.000 --> 20:43.000
but let me quick just explain if anybody should be listening for the first time

20:43.000 --> 20:45.000
because you heard about this through the President Cap stuff.

20:45.000 --> 20:47.000
You know, we're three friends who've been doing this show

20:47.000 --> 20:49.000
for about seven and a half years.

20:49.000 --> 20:51.000
We all met in an arcade playing Dance Dance Revolution,

20:51.000 --> 20:54.000
and we used to go to a little café right across the street

20:54.000 --> 20:57.000
called Brookfield's after a night of arcade gaming,

20:57.000 --> 20:59.000
and we'd just kind of sit around and talk smack about each other,

20:59.000 --> 21:02.000
about video games, about whatever was going on in the world.

21:02.000 --> 21:04.000
It was just basically nerds sitting around the dinner table,

21:04.000 --> 21:07.000
and that's kind of the theme we like to emulate here,

21:07.000 --> 21:09.000
and the way we invite you to the dinner table

21:09.000 --> 21:11.000
is through all the ways to interact with our show,

21:11.000 --> 21:14.000
chat.orangelandtrader.com, our Skype line, our mailbag, and so forth.

21:14.000 --> 21:15.000
Twitter now, too.

21:15.000 --> 21:16.000
I don't know you guys. Get out of my house.

21:16.000 --> 21:18.000
Shut up. All right.

21:18.000 --> 21:21.000
One way we like to always start off the show, though,

21:21.000 --> 21:23.000
is with what we've been playing this week.

21:23.000 --> 21:25.000
Dark Sakura, how have you had your gaming week?

21:25.000 --> 21:26.000
How was your gaming week?

21:26.000 --> 21:27.000
PEGGLE!

21:27.000 --> 21:29.000
Lots and lots of PEGGLE.

21:29.000 --> 21:34.000
My goal in PEGGLE has been to beat some of the levels on the first try,

21:34.000 --> 21:37.000
and I beat that freaking hard DNA level on the first try,

21:37.000 --> 21:38.000
and I was very proud of myself.

21:38.000 --> 21:41.000
Like, one of the last ones with the spirals going up.

21:41.000 --> 21:47.000
Anyway, I have also really not been playing much of anything else

21:47.000 --> 21:50.000
just simply because I had my midterms last week

21:50.000 --> 21:57.000
and migraines all last week and just the son of crap all week.

21:57.000 --> 22:00.000
So I haven't really had too much of an opportunity,

22:00.000 --> 22:05.000
although I'm still campaigning for, you know,

22:05.000 --> 22:08.000
potential World of Warcrafting, maybe.

22:08.000 --> 22:10.000
I just don't have time.

22:10.000 --> 22:12.000
All right.

22:12.000 --> 22:14.000
Loki, how was your gaming week?

22:14.000 --> 22:15.000
It was pretty good.

22:15.000 --> 22:18.000
I actually played, well, like I mentioned earlier,

22:18.000 --> 22:22.000
President Cat, so I played a little bit of the new Renegame,

22:22.000 --> 22:24.000
and it was fun.

22:24.000 --> 22:26.000
I got through.

22:26.000 --> 22:28.000
It starts off, it kind of breaks it up,

22:28.000 --> 22:30.000
like there's three minigames that you have to do

22:30.000 --> 22:32.000
and then like three more after that,

22:32.000 --> 22:34.000
and I got past the first three minigames,

22:34.000 --> 22:38.000
which is tough because the last one was like some question-answer thing.

22:38.000 --> 22:41.000
I can't read any of that, so I just kept hitting random buttons,

22:41.000 --> 22:43.000
and yet somehow I was getting it correct.

22:43.000 --> 22:45.000
So I managed to get past that.

22:45.000 --> 22:47.000
I played the piano portion,

22:47.000 --> 22:49.000
even though I was hitting it in time.

22:49.000 --> 22:51.000
I guess I wasn't doing it well enough,

22:51.000 --> 22:53.000
and so they're getting pissed off.

22:53.000 --> 22:56.000
And of course the car driving,

22:56.000 --> 23:00.000
which is weird because you're like controlling the cat in the back of the car

23:00.000 --> 23:05.000
that's sucking up what I look like stars or clouds or something.

23:05.000 --> 23:08.000
It's just weird.

23:08.000 --> 23:13.000
And then also play the cat dodging, which was kind of fun.

23:13.000 --> 23:16.000
But yeah, the game is weird and fun.

23:16.000 --> 23:18.000
So definitely worth checking out.

23:18.000 --> 23:21.000
The other thing of course I played tons of was DJ Hero.

23:21.000 --> 23:25.000
We just knocked out most of the songs in the game.

23:25.000 --> 23:28.000
I think I've actually played through everything now.

23:28.000 --> 23:30.000
Maybe a few tracks I'm missing,

23:30.000 --> 23:33.000
but I've almost five-starred everything on Medium,

23:33.000 --> 23:36.000
and I've started trying out some of the songs on Hard,

23:36.000 --> 23:41.000
and it gets a lot harder, that's for sure.

23:41.000 --> 23:44.000
But very fun game.

23:44.000 --> 23:48.000
I hope everyone checks it out when it comes out in two days.

23:48.000 --> 23:51.000
And then finally of course Grand Theft Auto IV

23:51.000 --> 23:53.000
played some more Lost and Damned.

23:53.000 --> 23:57.000
Also found a way around their patch to get rid of the mods,

23:57.000 --> 24:01.000
but I haven't really done much with that because it's not working correct.

24:01.000 --> 24:05.000
Because apparently if you've ever modded the Grand Theft Auto on PC,

24:05.000 --> 24:10.000
if you change too much, it becomes unstable.

24:10.000 --> 24:15.000
And then each save file actually saves some of the stuff that you change.

24:15.000 --> 24:17.000
So if I try to change certain weapons or whatever,

24:17.000 --> 24:21.000
they'll kind of disappear from the save, and it's a pain in the ass.

24:21.000 --> 24:24.000
So I found a way around all that,

24:24.000 --> 24:27.000
but unfortunately the modded discs I made was very unstable,

24:27.000 --> 24:29.000
so I have to go back to the drawing board.

24:29.000 --> 24:32.000
I don't really care though because the new expansion's coming out at the end of next week,

24:32.000 --> 24:34.000
so I may just hold off on modding everything

24:34.000 --> 24:39.000
until I can maybe get my hands on the episodes of Liberty City disc instead.

24:39.000 --> 24:42.000
Because that might be a little more fun.

24:42.000 --> 24:44.000
We were even just playing the new expansion,

24:44.000 --> 24:47.000
because that's just going to be all sorts of awesome.

24:47.000 --> 24:52.000
And other than that, I moved the arcade cabinet into the house this afternoon,

24:52.000 --> 24:55.000
so I'm hopefully going to be done with that soon.

24:55.000 --> 25:01.000
I'm downloading some front-end stuff for this program called Hyper Spin.

25:01.000 --> 25:03.000
I'm going to be running on it.

25:03.000 --> 25:08.000
So I've been downloading themes for a bunch of different games that I have in MAME.

25:08.000 --> 25:12.000
And that's it.

25:12.000 --> 25:15.000
I've been playing mostly World of Warcraft this week,

25:15.000 --> 25:17.000
because I'm sucked into wowcrack.

25:17.000 --> 25:20.000
But I did try out one new game.

25:20.000 --> 25:23.000
I say game in quotes because it wasn't really a game,

25:23.000 --> 25:28.000
but I checked out a game on PlayStation Network this week called Dot Detuned,

25:28.000 --> 25:31.000
or just Detuned I guess you could call the game.

25:31.000 --> 25:34.000
And it was something I think that was brought up at the very end of our show last week.

25:34.000 --> 25:36.000
I want to say one of the callers alerted us to it.

25:36.000 --> 25:39.000
I don't know if I saw it on Twitter during the week, but I saw it was $3.

25:39.000 --> 25:41.000
And I was like, wow, what a deal for a game.

25:41.000 --> 25:43.000
So I went ahead and downloaded it and checked it out.

25:43.000 --> 25:46.000
And yeah, it wasn't quite what I was expecting,

25:46.000 --> 25:50.000
because I heard that you could use custom soundtracks in the game,

25:50.000 --> 25:55.000
and I finally figured out why my songs weren't copying over on my USB card to the PS3.

25:55.000 --> 25:58.000
I had to go in there and do all or whatever, hit the triangle button.

25:58.000 --> 25:59.000
I was finally able to figure it out.

25:59.000 --> 26:02.000
So I got a bunch of custom songs on my PlayStation 3, so I was excited.

26:02.000 --> 26:07.000
And I was like, oh, a game that uses custom soundtracks and it says it builds the game around the soundtracks.

26:07.000 --> 26:10.000
I'm like, oh, cool, it's like a music game, like a beat matching game.

26:10.000 --> 26:14.000
I love music games, that's what I'm all about, so let's check out this game.

26:14.000 --> 26:17.000
Not exactly.

26:17.000 --> 26:21.000
This is one of those games that's kind of like, I guess you could call it video game art.

26:21.000 --> 26:25.000
And I know that's weird, because there's that whole controversy out there in the world,

26:25.000 --> 26:27.000
are video games art?

26:27.000 --> 26:31.000
But this is definitely one of those things where you kind of look at it and go,

26:31.000 --> 26:33.000
well, it's not really a game either.

26:33.000 --> 26:35.000
And PlayStation has a few of these.

26:35.000 --> 26:37.000
I mean, PlayStation Network's kind of been the home for these.

26:37.000 --> 26:42.000
But in a way, like Flower, that game on PlayStation Network was kind of art, too.

26:42.000 --> 26:45.000
But there was a game there, and that was a really cool game.

26:45.000 --> 26:50.000
Actually, I think Flower is one of the best, if not the best PlayStation Network title out there.

26:50.000 --> 26:52.000
It's a beautiful game.

26:52.000 --> 26:56.000
It's the strangest racing game you'll ever play in your life, but it's amazing.

26:56.000 --> 26:59.000
So I thought, okay, I'll take a chance on this Detune game.

26:59.000 --> 27:01.000
But it's really weird.

27:01.000 --> 27:04.000
Like, you use buttons to pump the guy sitting in the chair.

27:04.000 --> 27:08.000
And depending on what kind of skin you've selected with your direction buttons

27:08.000 --> 27:12.000
and your triangle, square, X buttons might make it do different things.

27:12.000 --> 27:15.000
Like, he might turn into an elephant man.

27:15.000 --> 27:18.000
Or he might turn into a ghost-looking man.

27:18.000 --> 27:21.000
And then as you wind the R-stick, he might dance around the chair

27:21.000 --> 27:23.000
or do this weird thing in the chair.

27:23.000 --> 27:25.000
And then if you hit another button, it deflates.

27:25.000 --> 27:28.000
Basically, it's like playing with a baby toy.

27:28.000 --> 27:31.000
You hit all these different buttons and it makes different noises

27:31.000 --> 27:32.000
or has all these different effects.

27:32.000 --> 27:33.000
It's very strange.

27:33.000 --> 27:35.000
But I can't stress this enough.

27:35.000 --> 27:37.000
There is no game here.

27:37.000 --> 27:39.000
There is no object. There is nothing to do.

27:39.000 --> 27:41.000
And yes, you can use your custom soundtracks.

27:41.000 --> 27:45.000
And some of the pumps and little effects will distort the soundtrack.

27:45.000 --> 27:49.000
This is literally one of those things that you sit there and you press the buttons

27:49.000 --> 27:51.000
and it kind of does different things.

27:51.000 --> 27:54.000
I imagine it's a lot more impactful if you're on drugs or something.

27:54.000 --> 27:57.000
I'm not on drugs, so I didn't quite see that.

27:57.000 --> 28:01.000
But yeah, it was just interesting.

28:01.000 --> 28:04.000
I'm not saying it was bad because it was three dollars.

28:04.000 --> 28:06.000
And it's certainly something different.

28:06.000 --> 28:08.000
I'm just saying it's not a game.

28:08.000 --> 28:10.000
So be careful.

28:10.000 --> 28:13.000
And yet it awards trophies even though it's not a game.

28:13.000 --> 28:14.000
And I will tell you this.

28:14.000 --> 28:17.000
If you want the easiest trophies,

28:17.000 --> 28:21.000
like easier than those achievements in the Avatar game on 360,

28:21.000 --> 28:23.000
just pay the three bucks for this game.

28:23.000 --> 28:26.000
And you can have a gold trophy, like three silvers and a handful of bronze.

28:26.000 --> 28:28.000
A handful of bronze in seconds.

28:28.000 --> 28:31.000
I didn't even look at what the trophies were.

28:31.000 --> 28:35.000
And I had all but one of them unlocked in five minutes in the game.

28:35.000 --> 28:37.000
It was incredibly simple.

28:37.000 --> 28:41.000
But that's, of course, I wouldn't recommend downloading a game just for trophies.

28:41.000 --> 28:43.000
But I know there's some people out there that are, you know,

28:43.000 --> 28:45.000
E-peen whores and want to see that stuff.

28:45.000 --> 28:49.000
Otherwise, this is kind of one of those things.

28:49.000 --> 28:51.000
I don't know if you ever go to the Museum of Modern Art

28:51.000 --> 28:53.000
and you see some things in there that are really, really cool.

28:53.000 --> 28:55.000
Like Andy Warhol paintings.

28:55.000 --> 28:56.000
Well, that's kind of neat.

28:56.000 --> 28:58.000
You know, that Marilyn Monroe painting is kind of rad.

28:58.000 --> 29:01.000
But then, like, you see that other piece on the wall that just looks like

29:01.000 --> 29:05.000
someone threw a paint can against the canvas and called it art.

29:05.000 --> 29:06.000
That's art!

29:06.000 --> 29:09.000
Well, this is, okay, well, this is what that game,

29:09.000 --> 29:12.000
this is the art equivalent of that.

29:12.000 --> 29:15.000
This is the video game equivalent of that art piece.

29:15.000 --> 29:20.000
You kind of look at it and go, okay, I guess there's art in here somewhere.

29:20.000 --> 29:25.000
So, but you know what, it does add to the very interesting debate

29:25.000 --> 29:28.000
that is, are video games art or not?

29:28.000 --> 29:30.000
It's very, very strange.

29:30.000 --> 29:32.000
So there you go.

29:32.000 --> 29:34.000
And I'm going to link this in the chat room.

29:34.000 --> 29:36.000
But look at this. Isn't that art?

29:36.000 --> 29:38.000
I've seen that before.

29:38.000 --> 29:42.000
But it's not what one would conventionally think of,

29:42.000 --> 29:44.000
like a Renoir or anything.

29:44.000 --> 29:45.000
I'll link it in the chat room.

29:45.000 --> 29:47.000
Terrible radio trying to describe a painting.

29:47.000 --> 29:48.000
There's lines and boxes.

29:48.000 --> 29:51.000
All I need to tell anyone is that it's one of Mondrian's work.

29:51.000 --> 29:55.000
You know, it's the primary colors, black and white on a grid,

29:55.000 --> 29:59.000
but that's still art, even though it's not really representational of anything.

29:59.000 --> 30:02.000
So, I mean, it all depends on what you enjoy.

30:02.000 --> 30:04.000
And there's some people that are going to look at that and go,

30:04.000 --> 30:06.000
what the fuck is that crap?

30:06.000 --> 30:08.000
You know, somebody paid thousands of dollars for that?

30:08.000 --> 30:11.000
So, and that would exactly be this game.

30:11.000 --> 30:13.000
There's going to be some people that look at it and go, wow, this is art.

30:13.000 --> 30:14.000
This is cool.

30:14.000 --> 30:20.000
This is just like an interactive experience that you can only get on a video game console.

30:20.000 --> 30:23.000
And there's some people that are going to look at it and go, what the fucking shit?

30:23.000 --> 30:24.000
Are these people on drugs?

30:24.000 --> 30:27.000
And keep in mind, there was the all audio game on Saturn where you get seeds.

30:27.000 --> 30:28.000
Uh-huh.

30:28.000 --> 30:33.000
And it's zero visual. It's all audio, the way you play the game.

30:33.000 --> 30:34.000
Interesting.

30:34.000 --> 30:36.000
And you grow seeds into plants.

30:36.000 --> 30:37.000
Is that like Seaman?

30:37.000 --> 30:39.000
No, seeds. Like, real.

30:39.000 --> 30:43.000
It comes with a packet of seeds and you plant them.

30:43.000 --> 30:44.000
All right.

30:44.000 --> 30:47.000
Yeah. So, that's not the most bizarre thing ever.

30:47.000 --> 30:50.000
Uh, going to the chat room, alpha-kinanagram is in caps.

30:50.000 --> 30:53.000
It's not a game, da-da-da. I believe I said that.

30:53.000 --> 30:54.000
It's not a game.

30:54.000 --> 30:58.000
But keep in mind, they're selling it in the game section of the PlayStation Store.

30:58.000 --> 31:00.000
So, just, you know, be forewarned.

31:00.000 --> 31:01.000
It is not a game.

31:01.000 --> 31:05.000
And it awards trophies like a game would do.

31:05.000 --> 31:08.000
You know, games usually have objectives and there are objectives with the trophy.

31:08.000 --> 31:10.000
But it's not a game. I'm just saying.

31:10.000 --> 31:12.000
It's not a game.

31:12.000 --> 31:14.000
I'm not saying it's bad.

31:14.000 --> 31:16.000
It's just weird.

31:16.000 --> 31:17.000
Different.

31:17.000 --> 31:19.000
Art is interpretation.

31:19.000 --> 31:21.000
I interpreted this as, huh?

31:21.000 --> 31:23.000
Some people are going to interpret this as cool.

31:23.000 --> 31:26.000
Some people are going to interpret this as, pfft.

31:26.000 --> 31:28.000
Just, interpretation.

31:28.000 --> 31:29.000
As caca.

31:29.000 --> 31:30.000
Yes, exactly.

31:30.000 --> 31:33.000
So, that pretty much does it for my gaming week.

31:33.000 --> 31:35.000
We're going to get into some gaming news here shortly.

31:35.000 --> 31:36.000
But first, some housekeeping.

31:36.000 --> 31:41.000
Hey, if you're not already, follow us on Twitter at www.Twitter.com slash O-L-R.

31:41.000 --> 31:43.000
And also on tonight's show.

31:43.000 --> 31:45.000
We actually have a pretty full show tonight.

31:45.000 --> 31:49.000
We're going to be interviewing later on in the show, in part B, our pal Seg.

31:49.000 --> 31:54.000
He is putting on a big part of this OOM LOUD event that's going on in San Francisco.

31:54.000 --> 31:56.000
It's a charity event for Child's Play.

31:56.000 --> 32:02.000
And we think these kinds of things that are very creative and involve video games and, you know, raise money for good causes.

32:02.000 --> 32:10.000
Things that give gamers a good name as opposed to, you know, kid shoots up neighbors, says he was inspired by Grand Theft Auto.

32:10.000 --> 32:15.000
We love covering things like this that really offset the crap stuff that's in the media.

32:15.000 --> 32:16.000
So, this is a great cause.

32:16.000 --> 32:18.000
We hope our friends in the Bay Area will show up to this.

32:18.000 --> 32:20.000
We're going to talk to Seg a little later in the show.

32:20.000 --> 32:21.000
Talk about OOM LOUD.

32:21.000 --> 32:22.000
I know I'm going.

32:22.000 --> 32:24.000
I think Jamie's going to go because I'll give her a ride.

32:24.000 --> 32:25.000
She said all she needed was a ride.

32:25.000 --> 32:27.000
Loki will try to get to go.

32:27.000 --> 32:30.000
If all of us can go, we could have a band.

32:30.000 --> 32:32.000
Might be fun.

32:32.000 --> 32:35.000
Loki, you might have to see if you can get away from the wife for a night.

32:35.000 --> 32:36.000
I don't know.

32:36.000 --> 32:37.000
We could call the band President Cat.

32:37.000 --> 32:38.000
Come on.

32:38.000 --> 32:39.000
You know you want to do it.

32:39.000 --> 32:41.000
All right.

32:41.000 --> 32:44.000
Anyhow, we'll get into that a little later on in Part B of our show.

32:44.000 --> 32:46.000
But first, some gaming news.

32:46.000 --> 32:47.000
Start us off tonight, Loki.

32:47.000 --> 32:48.000
Yes.

32:48.000 --> 32:52.000
Recently, Microsoft opened their first Microsoft store in Scottsdale, Arizona.

32:52.000 --> 32:58.000
And, of course, one of the big things about the store, other than kind of being sort of a copy of an Apple store,

32:58.000 --> 33:06.000
is that they have the ability to basically print their own Windows games.

33:06.000 --> 33:16.000
And the way this is done is you actually order it from a kiosk and then give your name, I guess, to one of the representatives in the stores.

33:16.000 --> 33:21.000
And then basically you wait a few minutes and you'll actually have the game with the label on the game printed,

33:21.000 --> 33:28.000
the case and inserts as well as the manual all printed for you.

33:28.000 --> 33:40.000
So it's kind of like that whole, I don't know, they have a kiosk out there that will print, or I guess it will make custom DVDs for you as well, like movies.

33:40.000 --> 33:51.000
But this is kind of cool, actually, because you can't really knock it since games, like for PC at least, there's not really a used market for them.

33:51.000 --> 33:54.000
At least not one that you would see in a GameStop or something like that.

33:54.000 --> 34:04.000
So if you're looking for a case and stuff and they don't have to have inventory in the store, I mean, that's pretty awesome.

34:04.000 --> 34:11.000
I'd be kind of curious to see if they could do something like this with Xbox Live arcade games or something. That'd be pretty cool.

34:11.000 --> 34:16.000
Kind of different. I mean, haven't they talked about this, though, for like video rentals, though?

34:16.000 --> 34:23.000
And I don't know how successful this was, but I think a while ago Blockbuster was talking about how video stores would sometimes run out of movies.

34:23.000 --> 34:27.000
That they could actually print out movies that you want to rent right there on the spot.

34:27.000 --> 34:31.000
Originally I thought that's what those Red Boss kiosks did, but I guess that's not really what they do.

34:31.000 --> 34:42.000
Now they had something that they were going to work on where you would be able to basically, it would burn DVDs for you, and you would have to get the licensing through different companies for this.

34:42.000 --> 34:53.000
And the people that were kind of participating in it were actually really small studios that didn't really have the money or whatever to sell stock and that kind of stuff.

34:53.000 --> 34:57.000
Or even catalog items for some of the major studios and whatnot.

34:57.000 --> 35:04.000
It was supposed to cut down their costs because they don't store all this catalog product that doesn't sell as fast.

35:04.000 --> 35:20.000
I guess I get the idea of putting out of print or catalog games into this kind of system, but as far as new games go, isn't the whole reason to walk into a store and buy a video game as opposed to just going onto Steam or Direct-to-Drive or one of those companies online?

35:20.000 --> 35:27.000
Isn't the whole point of having the box, having the manual and that kind of new game smell that comes when you open up the box?

35:27.000 --> 35:34.000
They still get that. I mean, they get the manual and everything printed. It's just, you know, they won't get the big giant cardboard box that goes with it.

35:34.000 --> 35:36.000
Which I guess saves trees, I don't know.

35:36.000 --> 35:42.000
And, you know, I guess you could look at it that way, but it's neat, I guess.

35:42.000 --> 35:50.000
You'll be able to get a disc and you won't have to worry about it being out of stock because they're just burning a game for you, so why not?

35:50.000 --> 35:59.000
Of course, I kind of look at this and go, well, you know, it would be cool, I guess, if the kiosk or whatever is kind of like showing you a demo of the game so you can play the game and then order it on the spot.

35:59.000 --> 36:05.000
But then again, you could kind of do the same thing with a lot of these online systems like Steam and so forth.

36:05.000 --> 36:08.000
You play a demo of the game and if you like it, drop the money for the full version.

36:08.000 --> 36:14.000
But I guess this might be cool for like parents going Christmas shopping, wanting to buy computer games for the kids.

36:14.000 --> 36:20.000
You know, you could see what the game looks like on a monitor in front of you, kind of see if it's appropriate for kids or not.

36:20.000 --> 36:26.000
Like if it's, you know, Lego that you're getting or if it's, you know, Demon Slayers from Hell with boobies or whatever.

36:26.000 --> 36:33.000
You know, you don't want to get the kids, you can kind of see what it is in the kiosk before you actually buy it and then have it printed right there.

36:33.000 --> 36:36.000
I guess that would be the target audience for this kind of thing?

36:36.000 --> 36:37.000
I think so, yeah.

36:37.000 --> 36:38.000
Question mark?

36:38.000 --> 36:39.000
Yeah.

36:39.000 --> 36:44.000
And some comments from our chatroom at chat.orangelaunchradio.com.

36:44.000 --> 36:48.000
GameGuru says, besides, you can buy DVD cases and print out box art.

36:48.000 --> 36:50.000
Yeah, but I don't know, it's not the same.

36:50.000 --> 36:53.000
Like the homemade stuff just isn't the same to me.

36:53.000 --> 36:58.000
It's not the same and they actually, you know, obviously since it's games for Windows stuff, they have this stuff licensed.

36:58.000 --> 37:02.000
They have the actual manufacturers giving them the artwork for this.

37:02.000 --> 37:14.000
They have probably the process to, I'm sure it's not just going to be like an inkjet printer printing out a piece of crappy, you know, artwork that's going to be on paper that looks like cheap, you know, crap that you would make at home.

37:14.000 --> 37:17.000
But I think this is going to be a little bit better than that.

37:17.000 --> 37:27.000
And I don't know, I mean, I'd be interested to see, there's a lot of people that reported on this and, you know, obviously a lot of people that visited the store.

37:27.000 --> 37:35.000
So, how is the software that's, you know, burned off that? I mean, does it look good? Does it, you know, look cheap and knocked off?

37:35.000 --> 37:39.000
I mean, is it something that you could probably do at home for a lot less or?

37:39.000 --> 37:44.000
Haven't you ever bought a video game and then you came home and like you were just kind of opening and going through it?

37:44.000 --> 37:50.000
And unfortunately a lot of console games, especially Nintendo ones, put a lot of crap in there like sign up for the club, sign up for the whatever.

37:50.000 --> 37:57.000
But haven't you ever like, there's been some games where you pull out the manual and you're like, this is an epic manual.

37:57.000 --> 37:58.000
And I'm kind of glad I bought the game.

37:58.000 --> 38:00.000
Anything Working Designs did?

38:00.000 --> 38:06.000
Yeah. I thought Demon's Souls, just speaking of a very recent game, had a pretty epic manual with it.

38:06.000 --> 38:08.000
I'm sure there's a lot of games out there.

38:08.000 --> 38:12.000
And it's just not the same thing as, you know, running it on the inkjet or looking at a PDF file.

38:12.000 --> 38:17.000
I would like to see them at their store and I would like to see this in actually other stores.

38:17.000 --> 38:25.000
I mean, and yeah, I know you can buy Microsoft points and stuff like that and go purchase your own Xbox Live Arcade games.

38:25.000 --> 38:30.000
But I want actual cards for like each individual game, you know, or something that I could print up and say,

38:30.000 --> 38:36.000
OK, I want to give the gift of like, and why I would never punish someone like this.

38:36.000 --> 38:42.000
Give someone the gift of, say, the Warriors game that they put on Xbox Live Arcade, you know,

38:42.000 --> 38:48.000
and have it actually print up with like, you know, a nice little logo and stuff like that and have the code redeem that game.

38:48.000 --> 38:50.000
And only that game.

38:50.000 --> 38:52.000
I think that would be kind of cool.

38:52.000 --> 38:58.000
But, you know, obviously I know they're out to sell the points cards and stuff because in that way you buy a game

38:58.000 --> 39:04.000
and you still have extra points left over and they get you to spend, you know, $20 and $50 instead of, say, $10 or $15.

39:04.000 --> 39:12.000
So, OK, Jamie brought in an epic manual that came to her mind and it's for Sega Ages on the Sega Saturn and it's fancy.

39:12.000 --> 39:16.000
It's got like raised print and like the foil writing for Sega Ages.

39:16.000 --> 39:18.000
It was a working designs game.

39:18.000 --> 39:20.000
It's pretty epic.

39:20.000 --> 39:21.000
There you go.

39:21.000 --> 39:28.000
So, I know, could we make cards for Yaris and get those printed and I can give those to like, it's like giving someone a fruitcake for Christmas?

39:28.000 --> 39:29.000
Yeah, it's free.

39:29.000 --> 39:30.000
That would be kind of funny.

39:30.000 --> 39:36.000
But even like, you know, not necessarily that, but like custom 1600 point cards or something.

39:36.000 --> 39:38.000
I guess you could do that if you had the time.

39:38.000 --> 39:48.000
You know, just buy a bunch of them and pull them all off and transpose the, you know, the number over to whatever new card you make.

39:48.000 --> 39:49.000
I don't know.

39:49.000 --> 39:56.000
It's just a neat idea and, you know, it's a neat way to go, especially now since a lot of businesses are trying to go all digital.

39:56.000 --> 40:00.000
So, I don't know. It's kind of cool.

40:00.000 --> 40:04.000
Well, this is a game whose manual I'd be curious to see what it looks like.

40:04.000 --> 40:06.000
It's a game called Choaniki.

40:06.000 --> 40:10.000
It's the sequel, I guess, or the prequel Choaniki Zero.

40:10.000 --> 40:12.000
There have been a ton of Choaniki games.

40:12.000 --> 40:13.000
Yes, but there's a new one coming out.

40:13.000 --> 40:17.000
It's coming out to the PSP in spring of 2010.

40:17.000 --> 40:21.000
It is coming out also as a download title because that's where all the PSP titles are going now.

40:21.000 --> 40:26.000
And, by the way, this is coming out here in the U.S.

40:26.000 --> 40:28.000
This is being localized.

40:28.000 --> 40:31.000
By whom is it being localized?

40:31.000 --> 40:34.000
Some brave, brave soul.

40:34.000 --> 40:38.000
To be honest, I think Ax-AK-Sis is the name of the company.

40:38.000 --> 40:40.000
Ax-Sis Game Localization.

40:40.000 --> 40:43.000
The company I was talking about that localizes obscure shit.

40:43.000 --> 40:45.000
Hello, this would be a perfect candidate.

40:45.000 --> 40:49.000
This would be a perfect candidate because, honestly, like seriously.

40:49.000 --> 40:51.000
It was so funny to see, you know, going back.

40:51.000 --> 40:54.000
I'm picking on Joystiq a little bit when they were kind enough to run our article first.

40:54.000 --> 40:55.000
But I have to say this.

40:55.000 --> 40:59.000
It was so funny to see that whole little like Debbie Downer paragraph at the end about,

40:59.000 --> 41:02.000
well, it would be a shame to see them localize this and lose money on it.

41:02.000 --> 41:05.000
And then like not even a day later, here's a story.

41:05.000 --> 41:09.000
Choaniki Zero being localized for the U.S. as if there's an audience for this.

41:09.000 --> 41:14.000
Because a lot of people look at this and go L-O-L-W-T-F because, yes, if you don't already know,

41:14.000 --> 41:23.000
it's all about like muscle bound guys wearing thong and all this muscle man-tastic voyage, I believe,

41:23.000 --> 41:25.000
that press relief Steven said about it.

41:25.000 --> 41:28.000
I mean this is a ludicrous freaking game.

41:28.000 --> 41:33.000
Yet it's getting localized and it's coming out of here.

41:33.000 --> 41:36.000
And the SNES one came out in Virtual Console.

41:36.000 --> 41:38.000
And don't get me wrong.

41:38.000 --> 41:42.000
I'm all for this kind of like weird shit coming out and I might even like check it out.

41:42.000 --> 41:44.000
Especially if there's a demo for me to play.

41:44.000 --> 41:46.000
You know, it's something different.

41:46.000 --> 41:49.000
It certainly stands out from the countless other shooters I've seen.

41:49.000 --> 41:52.000
But it is a little weird.

41:52.000 --> 41:54.000
But there's an audience for this.

41:54.000 --> 41:58.000
So I just can't, it's funny to me that there's an audience for this.

41:58.000 --> 42:03.000
Yet President Cat, you know, doesn't apparently have an audience over here.

42:03.000 --> 42:05.000
And it's going to end up in bargain bins across America.

42:05.000 --> 42:08.000
So it's just interesting.

42:08.000 --> 42:14.000
So yeah, as Loki said, there's your perfect candidate company for someone to bring the kitty cat games over with.

42:14.000 --> 42:15.000
We'll see.

42:15.000 --> 42:20.000
Well, how about something that is no surprise to anybody?

42:20.000 --> 42:22.000
What's that?

42:22.000 --> 42:28.000
Microsoft has poo-pooed on any thoughts of having Blu-ray on Xbox 360.

42:28.000 --> 42:31.000
Which we sort of knew.

42:31.000 --> 42:37.000
But they were talking about, Microsoft was actually talking about Blu-ray accessories for the PC.

42:37.000 --> 42:39.000
But not for the Xbox 360.

42:39.000 --> 42:43.000
Yeah, I think some interview that some dude did with some website earlier this week.

42:43.000 --> 42:46.000
Isn't that so professional? Some dude at some website.

42:46.000 --> 42:50.000
It's pretty much the boss, Steve Ballmer, said uh-uh.

42:50.000 --> 42:56.000
But a lot of people interpreted him to say that these Blu-ray, oh Blu-ray for Xbox 360, imminent.

42:56.000 --> 42:58.000
I saw that all over Twitter that night.

42:58.000 --> 43:00.000
Blu-rays coming to Xbox 360.

43:00.000 --> 43:03.000
That was me rolling my eyes and going, no.

43:03.000 --> 43:04.000
Yeah.

43:04.000 --> 43:07.000
Why would Microsoft put out a Sony product especially?

43:07.000 --> 43:09.000
And you know they kind of make a good point.

43:09.000 --> 43:14.000
And it's funny enough because yet again, here's something we just talked about two weeks ago on the show or even last week.

43:14.000 --> 43:22.000
I think before all that cat madness started, we were talking about how, you know, one thing that Sony has that Microsoft doesn't have is Blu-ray.

43:22.000 --> 43:27.000
And if Microsoft was smart, they would be selling the streaming video, the Netflix.

43:27.000 --> 43:32.000
And sure enough, when they kind of backpedaled on what the dude had said earlier in the week.

43:32.000 --> 43:39.000
They said, hey, we're going to be the only system with streaming 1080p very soon.

43:39.000 --> 43:43.000
So they're kind of saying, you don't need Blu-ray when you have streaming video.

43:43.000 --> 43:45.000
Yeah.

43:45.000 --> 43:46.000
I don't know.

43:46.000 --> 43:49.000
I like the Netflix Instant Q stuff.

43:49.000 --> 43:55.000
I like Netflix Instant Q, but at the same time, I'm very proud this week of one of my purchases.

43:55.000 --> 43:59.000
I bought the box collection of the Star Trek Next Generation movies.

43:59.000 --> 44:02.000
That's right, all four movies with Captain Picard and a bonus disc.

44:02.000 --> 44:03.000
I'm very excited.

44:03.000 --> 44:04.000
On Blu-ray.

44:04.000 --> 44:06.000
And that's not something I would have wanted to download.

44:06.000 --> 44:07.000
So you're bringing that over, right?

44:07.000 --> 44:08.000
We could totally have a Nerdathon.

44:08.000 --> 44:09.000
I am all over.

44:09.000 --> 44:11.000
I actually haven't seen Insurrection.

44:11.000 --> 44:13.000
What?

44:13.000 --> 44:14.000
And I've got it on Laserdisc, I think.

44:14.000 --> 44:17.000
Oh my gosh, we should totally have a Blu-ray Next Genathon.

44:17.000 --> 44:20.000
No, I have first contact on Laserdisc.

44:20.000 --> 44:21.000
Can we drink?

44:21.000 --> 44:22.000
Sure.

44:22.000 --> 44:23.000
Awesome.

44:23.000 --> 44:24.000
We're going to have a nerdy slumber party.

44:24.000 --> 44:25.000
I like Booz Mahal.

44:25.000 --> 44:26.000
It'll be awesome.

44:26.000 --> 44:28.000
Anyhow, I don't know how we got off topic.

44:28.000 --> 44:32.000
But for me, it's kind of the same thing going back to the story we were talking about earlier

44:32.000 --> 44:34.000
with the games being printed on demand.

44:34.000 --> 44:37.000
I would not have downloaded the Star Trek collection.

44:37.000 --> 44:41.000
And even though I could probably get a lot of these on Instant Netflix,

44:41.000 --> 44:48.000
it's just not the same as having the collection in your house anytime you want, put in the disc.

44:48.000 --> 44:52.000
Yeah, but it's easier for me to watch stuff on my computer.

44:52.000 --> 44:55.000
Is it just me or Blu-rays seeming to get a little cheaper?

44:55.000 --> 44:57.000
They're getting a little cheaper, not much.

44:57.000 --> 44:59.000
You're finding used ones more often.

44:59.000 --> 45:01.000
And I'm finding a lot of sales now.

45:01.000 --> 45:03.000
I'm seeing a lot of Blu-rays.

45:03.000 --> 45:04.000
I was at Best Buy this week.

45:04.000 --> 45:06.000
One game I didn't talk about during my gaming week,

45:06.000 --> 45:08.000
because we've talked about it at length the past couple weeks,

45:08.000 --> 45:10.000
I finally played the DJ Hero demo.

45:10.000 --> 45:12.000
Loki's had DJ Hero here the past couple weeks,

45:12.000 --> 45:15.000
but he's always been the one playing it because he knows what he's doing.

45:15.000 --> 45:17.000
I finally got my hands on it this week, and that was fun.

45:17.000 --> 45:19.000
I was at Best Buy, and I was looking at Blu-rays.

45:19.000 --> 45:21.000
They had a lot of Blu-rays available for $10, $15.

45:21.000 --> 45:25.000
So they're starting to come the way of DVDs.

45:25.000 --> 45:26.000
They're still a little more expensive than DVDs.

45:26.000 --> 45:28.000
You can get DVDs for $4 at Walmart,

45:28.000 --> 45:33.000
but they're coming down a little bit, which is nice.

45:33.000 --> 45:34.000
All right.

45:34.000 --> 45:36.000
Let's move on with some more gaming news.

45:36.000 --> 45:38.000
We'll get to release dates very soon

45:38.000 --> 45:41.000
and see if there's anything wacky coming out this week.

45:41.000 --> 45:42.000
But first, some more news.

45:42.000 --> 45:47.000
Yeah, and I don't know about another president, Kat.

45:47.000 --> 45:50.000
Yeah, I'm all campaigned out.

45:50.000 --> 45:54.000
So Xbox Live, the preview for the new fall update,

45:54.000 --> 45:58.000
they have sent out their first Wave 1 invites.

45:58.000 --> 46:02.000
In fact, actually, I got one of those, so I have the new update.

46:02.000 --> 46:05.000
I haven't gotten a chance to play with a lot of the stuff on there,

46:05.000 --> 46:07.000
but I did do the Twitter thing,

46:07.000 --> 46:12.000
and the problem I see is I don't think I'm going to use half this stuff.

46:12.000 --> 46:17.000
I mean, the Twitter and the Facebook stuff, it's neat.

46:17.000 --> 46:20.000
Do you know how many tweets I saw this week that were,

46:20.000 --> 46:24.000
hey, I'm posting from my 360? I'm just like, eye roll.

46:24.000 --> 46:26.000
Like, we totally saw this coming.

46:26.000 --> 46:28.000
Everybody's going to have to do that mandatory tweet.

46:28.000 --> 46:31.000
Hey, guys, I got in the preview program.

46:31.000 --> 46:32.000
Here's my tweet from the 360.

46:32.000 --> 46:35.000
Hey, I want to tell you guys a secret.

46:35.000 --> 46:38.000
Almost everybody who signs up for these preview programs gets in.

46:38.000 --> 46:39.000
You know why?

46:39.000 --> 46:42.000
Because it's Microsoft's little way now.

46:42.000 --> 46:44.000
Do you remember when their system crashed a couple of years ago

46:44.000 --> 46:45.000
when they rolled out one of these updates

46:45.000 --> 46:47.000
because everybody was freaking downloading it at once?

46:47.000 --> 46:50.000
This little preview program is their way of doing a rolling release

46:50.000 --> 46:52.000
for these updates.

46:52.000 --> 46:54.000
Except they're going to have to re-download it.

46:54.000 --> 46:55.000
It's not the full thing.

46:55.000 --> 46:56.000
Oh, really?

46:56.000 --> 46:57.000
Yeah.

46:57.000 --> 46:58.000
Interesting.

46:58.000 --> 47:00.000
Because the music store isn't working yet.

47:00.000 --> 47:03.000
Well, they have Lips on there, and that's it.

47:03.000 --> 47:07.000
But yeah, so apparently a lot of people got in on it,

47:07.000 --> 47:10.000
and they did have a lot of cool stuff in there.

47:10.000 --> 47:12.000
Of course, if you're in the UK, you got to check out the Skyplayer

47:12.000 --> 47:14.000
and that kind of thing.

47:14.000 --> 47:21.000
Over here in North America, they had, of course, the Last.fm,

47:21.000 --> 47:22.000
Facebook.

47:22.000 --> 47:23.000
Did you check out the Last.fm by chance?

47:23.000 --> 47:24.000
No, I haven't.

47:24.000 --> 47:26.000
That's the one thing I am kind of curious about,

47:26.000 --> 47:27.000
because I am a Last.fm user.

47:27.000 --> 47:30.000
I prefer it to Pandora and the other services available out there.

47:30.000 --> 47:32.000
I think they're great,

47:32.000 --> 47:34.000
because the way it kind of syncs up with your iPod and everything

47:34.000 --> 47:36.000
with the Scrobbler,

47:36.000 --> 47:39.000
and the recommendations have been, for the most part, pretty good.

47:39.000 --> 47:43.000
So I'm really curious to see what the Last.fm does,

47:43.000 --> 47:46.000
if I can play them during my games or what.

47:46.000 --> 47:49.000
Maybe somebody in chat who's in the preview program can clue me in.

47:49.000 --> 47:51.000
It would be cool if you can,

47:51.000 --> 47:56.000
because I've done a little bit of custom soundtrack stuff.

47:56.000 --> 47:58.000
There's not a lot of games that use it quite right.

47:58.000 --> 48:00.000
Like Grand Theft Auto, for example,

48:00.000 --> 48:02.000
when you just play it, it just plays over everything,

48:02.000 --> 48:05.000
and it's kind of annoying, because it doesn't just play

48:05.000 --> 48:07.000
when you get in a car or something like that,

48:07.000 --> 48:09.000
which is disappointing.

48:09.000 --> 48:11.000
I don't know.

48:11.000 --> 48:12.000
It's neat.

48:12.000 --> 48:15.000
I'll probably get a chance to play with a little bit more of it this week.

48:15.000 --> 48:16.000
I just kind of like,

48:16.000 --> 48:18.000
oh, look, hey, it downloaded, and, you know,

48:18.000 --> 48:20.000
oh, okay, try the tweet.

48:20.000 --> 48:21.000
Okay, I'm going to bed.

48:21.000 --> 48:23.000
You know, and that was it.

48:23.000 --> 48:25.000
The chat room is confirming for me,

48:25.000 --> 48:27.000
DJ Dark Knight and Golden Anthro both saying

48:27.000 --> 48:28.000
you can't play them with your games.

48:28.000 --> 48:30.000
Last.fm does not work with your game.

48:30.000 --> 48:32.000
Okay, that's lame.

48:32.000 --> 48:34.000
Well, I guess it's the kind of thing that might be

48:34.000 --> 48:36.000
background noise at parties or something,

48:36.000 --> 48:38.000
or, you know, I could just turn on the Xbox in my living room,

48:38.000 --> 48:40.000
because I don't have a computer in my living room,

48:40.000 --> 48:42.000
and let's say maybe I'm cleaning or something

48:42.000 --> 48:44.000
and I want to listen to synth pop while I do it,

48:44.000 --> 48:46.000
I could bring up Last.fm, type in synth pop,

48:46.000 --> 48:49.000
run it on my 360, and clean my living room.

48:49.000 --> 48:51.000
Actually, okay, we all know it would be Spice Girls,

48:51.000 --> 48:54.000
but, you know, I'm saying, whatever you want.

48:54.000 --> 49:00.000
Synth pop and Spice Girls mixed together would be epic.

49:00.000 --> 49:02.000
Very epic.

49:02.000 --> 49:04.000
And Tiger Claw also confirms that the music stops playing

49:04.000 --> 49:05.000
when you exit out of it.

49:05.000 --> 49:07.000
So it sounds like it's kind of like an independent application,

49:07.000 --> 49:09.000
kind of like Netflix is, basically.

49:09.000 --> 49:11.000
Like, the movies stop when you leave Netflix.

49:11.000 --> 49:13.000
Like, all the programs are kind of like that, too,

49:13.000 --> 49:15.000
like, you know, the Twitter and stuff,

49:15.000 --> 49:17.000
it kind of goes into its own program thing,

49:17.000 --> 49:19.000
and then you actually back out to the main menu

49:19.000 --> 49:21.000
when you're done.

49:21.000 --> 49:23.000
Whatever, I mean, if I really am that desperate

49:23.000 --> 49:25.000
to check, you know, Twitter and stuff,

49:25.000 --> 49:27.000
I guess that would be handy.

49:27.000 --> 49:29.000
It might be useful, like, if I, whatever,

49:29.000 --> 49:31.000
go on the road or something like that

49:31.000 --> 49:33.000
and I have my Xbox 360 and I don't have, like,

49:33.000 --> 49:35.000
you know, my laptop or something like that,

49:35.000 --> 49:37.000
that might be important.

49:37.000 --> 49:39.000
It might be about, you know, hey, you know,

49:39.000 --> 49:41.000
where are you guys going to be at this time,

49:41.000 --> 49:43.000
or something like that.

49:43.000 --> 49:45.000
You know, assuming that I don't have their cell phone number

49:45.000 --> 49:47.000
or something like that, because I would just use my cell phone.

49:47.000 --> 49:49.000
But, um, it might be neat.

49:49.000 --> 49:51.000
But then again, after all this stuff is in here and stuff,

49:51.000 --> 49:53.000
I have to wonder,

49:53.000 --> 49:55.000
why the hell is there not an internet browser yet?

49:55.000 --> 49:57.000
That is very, very good question.

49:57.000 --> 49:59.000
That is one thing that Xbox is, like,

49:59.000 --> 50:01.000
sorely lacking, and these are the people

50:01.000 --> 50:03.000
that make Internet Explorer.

50:03.000 --> 50:05.000
Why?

50:05.000 --> 50:07.000
Is there not, unless,

50:07.000 --> 50:09.000
you know, because Internet Explorer is,

50:09.000 --> 50:11.000
you know, kind of a magnet for bugs

50:11.000 --> 50:13.000
and all sorts of exploits and whatnot

50:13.000 --> 50:15.000
that they're worried that somehow they're going to

50:15.000 --> 50:17.000
find a way around.

50:17.000 --> 50:19.000
Oh, people playing, like, emulated games,

50:19.000 --> 50:21.000
like, Nintendo games in a Flash browser

50:21.000 --> 50:23.000
or something, you know?

50:23.000 --> 50:25.000
Is that what they're worried about, maybe?

50:25.000 --> 50:27.000
Maybe. But I would think, though, with maybe Facebook

50:27.000 --> 50:29.000
or something, you might be able to kind of exploit something, too.

50:29.000 --> 50:31.000
You know, I never even thought to do that on the Playstation,

50:31.000 --> 50:33.000
because the Playstation has a decent web browser.

50:33.000 --> 50:35.000
But is it just me, or

50:35.000 --> 50:37.000
are both the Playstation and the Wii

50:37.000 --> 50:39.000
their web browsers? It's kind of clunky.

50:39.000 --> 50:41.000
Like, they just don't work like it does on a computer.

50:41.000 --> 50:43.000
And, I don't know,

50:43.000 --> 50:45.000
especially when I'm using, like, the YouTube TV site,

50:45.000 --> 50:47.000
like, they're so slow to load.

50:47.000 --> 50:49.000
That's been the hang-up

50:49.000 --> 50:51.000
of any type of web system

50:51.000 --> 50:53.000
on a console.

50:53.000 --> 50:55.000
I mean, really. You think, I mean,

50:55.000 --> 50:57.000
but isn't the PS3 supposed to be a computer?

50:57.000 --> 50:59.000
So they said, I think they did it

50:59.000 --> 51:01.000
just for the tax cut, remember?

51:01.000 --> 51:03.000
I guess. I don't know, they seem

51:03.000 --> 51:05.000
a little clunky to me, because I love doing,

51:05.000 --> 51:07.000
like, you know, you guys have been to my house,

51:07.000 --> 51:09.000
and, you know, like, when I have a lot of

51:09.000 --> 51:11.000
people over, we'll fire up YouTube

51:11.000 --> 51:13.000
and watch funny things, and it's really good

51:13.000 --> 51:15.000
to be able to do it on the Wii or the Playstation 3.

51:15.000 --> 51:17.000
You know, I love that new YouTube channel,

51:17.000 --> 51:19.000
but it's slow and clunky.

51:19.000 --> 51:21.000
You know what I say, if you want to run anything off the internet

51:21.000 --> 51:23.000
on your TV, build a multimedia

51:23.000 --> 51:25.000
box.

51:25.000 --> 51:27.000
I guess, but... Especially now with an HDTV,

51:27.000 --> 51:29.000
it's so

51:29.000 --> 51:31.000
cheap and

51:31.000 --> 51:33.000
easy to do.

51:33.000 --> 51:35.000
DJ Dark Knight does say in chat,

51:35.000 --> 51:37.000
I do like how on Last.fm they do have

51:37.000 --> 51:39.000
video game music stations. I wasn't aware of that.

51:39.000 --> 51:41.000
That's kinda interesting.

51:41.000 --> 51:43.000
So I'm gonna have to check this out. You know I'm going on, like,

51:43.000 --> 51:45.000
60 days since I've played on Xbox 360.

51:45.000 --> 51:47.000
I'm like, I've been all Playstation 3

51:47.000 --> 51:49.000
lately, so...

51:49.000 --> 51:51.000
Very interesting. Anyhow,

51:51.000 --> 51:53.000
speaking of Playstation 3, I signed into home,

51:53.000 --> 51:55.000
and there were, like, six requests to join our club,

51:55.000 --> 51:57.000
so I approved them all, so if you want to join the

51:57.000 --> 51:59.000
Sony home club

51:59.000 --> 52:01.000
for Orange Lounge Radio, look for us on the

52:01.000 --> 52:03.000
search and at us

52:03.000 --> 52:05.000
before we fill up.

52:05.000 --> 52:07.000
Moving on to another game

52:07.000 --> 52:09.000
story about Fable 3.

52:09.000 --> 52:11.000
Fable 3, a couple of things

52:11.000 --> 52:13.000
about this. There will be an in-game

52:13.000 --> 52:15.000
shop with microtransactions

52:15.000 --> 52:17.000
in Fable 3. I'm sure this is

52:17.000 --> 52:19.000
no surprise at all.

52:19.000 --> 52:21.000
But what they're doing, they're kind of integrating this

52:21.000 --> 52:23.000
in-game shop in the game world,

52:23.000 --> 52:25.000
and you buy the download content in

52:25.000 --> 52:27.000
this shop with the experience.

52:27.000 --> 52:29.000
In other words,

52:29.000 --> 52:31.000
you don't pop up a new screen that takes

52:31.000 --> 52:33.000
you to the Xbox Live Marketplace.

52:33.000 --> 52:35.000
In my mind, this is kind of similar to what Rock Band 2

52:35.000 --> 52:37.000
did a little while ago. That's kind of

52:37.000 --> 52:39.000
very integrated into the game, but of course

52:39.000 --> 52:41.000
Rock Band's a very different type of game than

52:41.000 --> 52:43.000
Fable 3, so it'll be interesting.

52:43.000 --> 52:45.000
And they are saying

52:45.000 --> 52:47.000
that possibly one idea

52:47.000 --> 52:49.000
is that special weapons could sell

52:49.000 --> 52:51.000
for $1.70.

52:51.000 --> 52:53.000
This is starting to tread into dangerous

52:53.000 --> 52:55.000
territory, though. I don't like the idea

52:55.000 --> 52:57.000
that I could spend real money

52:57.000 --> 52:59.000
at the touch of a button for

52:59.000 --> 53:01.000
weapon upgrades.

53:01.000 --> 53:03.000
I mean, this is starting to get a little cheap.

53:03.000 --> 53:05.000
That's getting silly.

53:05.000 --> 53:07.000
I'm sorry, here's my problem with it.

53:07.000 --> 53:09.000
It's Fable 3, and I'm sorry.

53:09.000 --> 53:11.000
Luckily for me,

53:11.000 --> 53:13.000
I didn't play Fable 1. I played

53:13.000 --> 53:15.000
Fable 2, and I learned my lesson

53:15.000 --> 53:17.000
not to trust Peter Molyneaux for

53:17.000 --> 53:19.000
crap, and I don't get it

53:19.000 --> 53:21.000
because I really enjoyed Fable 2.

53:21.000 --> 53:23.000
It was one of my favorite games that year it came out.

53:23.000 --> 53:25.000
No, I got bored with it really fast.

53:25.000 --> 53:27.000
That's where we have differing opinions

53:27.000 --> 53:29.000
on Long Long Radio. Exactly, and Fable 3

53:29.000 --> 53:31.000
I'm sorry, they're going to start doing this in the

53:31.000 --> 53:33.000
tall stuff. They're going to have this

53:33.000 --> 53:35.000
store in there, and yeah, I know I don't have to buy any

53:35.000 --> 53:37.000
of this stuff, but

53:37.000 --> 53:39.000
I'm just going to bypass the whole game altogether.

53:39.000 --> 53:41.000
Unless there's something that's really

53:41.000 --> 53:43.000
awesome that I must play in this.

53:43.000 --> 53:45.000
I mean, I

53:45.000 --> 53:47.000
guess it's where we're going to be going

53:47.000 --> 53:49.000
with it. I mean, so...

53:49.000 --> 53:51.000
It's the trend that's showing

53:51.000 --> 53:53.000
up that I'm getting really nervous about.

53:53.000 --> 53:55.000
But the bottom line is, if you don't like it, don't buy it.

53:55.000 --> 53:57.000
Show them that you're not going to support it.

53:57.000 --> 53:59.000
That's really what it boils down to in the end.

53:59.000 --> 54:01.000
But it's just kind of sad that it's going there in the

54:01.000 --> 54:03.000
first place. I'm still going to buy Fable 3. I loved

54:03.000 --> 54:05.000
Fable 2, and the first Fable was good too.

54:05.000 --> 54:07.000
You know, no matter what, I'm going to buy it,

54:07.000 --> 54:09.000
but

54:09.000 --> 54:11.000
this is a little ridiculous.

54:11.000 --> 54:13.000
I'll just get my upgrades naturally. I know, I don't

54:13.000 --> 54:15.000
like it for these

54:15.000 --> 54:17.000
super great weapons

54:17.000 --> 54:19.000
that you can, you know,

54:19.000 --> 54:21.000
that are better than the ones you

54:21.000 --> 54:23.000
get in the game normally. Like, if World of Warcraft

54:23.000 --> 54:25.000
ever did this, this is what I'm really worried about,

54:25.000 --> 54:27.000
is MMOs going this route where World of Warcraft

54:27.000 --> 54:29.000
sells the Uber weapon.

54:29.000 --> 54:31.000
Like, that'll be the day I leave World of Warcraft.

54:31.000 --> 54:33.000
Because that's kind of bold that somebody would be able

54:33.000 --> 54:35.000
to pay money and get the weapon.

54:35.000 --> 54:37.000
Yeah, I agree. You know, although I

54:37.000 --> 54:39.000
suppose one could argue they can do that now

54:39.000 --> 54:41.000
and pay a gold farmer to buy the

54:41.000 --> 54:43.000
crafted stuff, but... By the way,

54:43.000 --> 54:45.000
something that didn't make our show this week, but I want to say

54:45.000 --> 54:47.000
it really quick, because I want to applaud Blizzard,

54:47.000 --> 54:49.000
finally kind of did a little campaign

54:49.000 --> 54:51.000
against gold sellers this week, and basically

54:51.000 --> 54:53.000
coming out and saying, look, if you support gold selling,

54:53.000 --> 54:55.000
you are supporting the hacking of people's

54:55.000 --> 54:57.000
accounts. You know, you're supporting all this stuff.

54:57.000 --> 54:59.000
Did I even talk about on this show

54:59.000 --> 55:01.000
that my WoW account was hacked a couple weeks ago?

55:01.000 --> 55:03.000
Did I? Okay. And it sucks.

55:03.000 --> 55:05.000
It totally sucks when something like that happens.

55:05.000 --> 55:07.000
So, I totally agree with their stance.

55:07.000 --> 55:09.000
If you buy gold online, you suck.

55:09.000 --> 55:11.000
Because you're supporting

55:11.000 --> 55:13.000
this practice of

55:13.000 --> 55:15.000
hacking accounts like mine, and supporting

55:15.000 --> 55:17.000
keyloggers and funding this,

55:17.000 --> 55:19.000
basically. So, don't buy gold

55:19.000 --> 55:21.000
online.

55:21.000 --> 55:23.000
One other thing I wanted to state, although

55:23.000 --> 55:25.000
Matt kind of stated it. It was circulated also

55:25.000 --> 55:27.000
this week. Project Natal will be

55:27.000 --> 55:29.000
supported in Fable 3. That, of course, should come

55:29.000 --> 55:31.000
as no surprise at all, since

55:31.000 --> 55:33.000
Peter Molyneux was, of course, out there

55:33.000 --> 55:35.000
at E3 this year, kind of,

55:35.000 --> 55:37.000
you know, promoting Project

55:37.000 --> 55:39.000
Natal, but there will be support for it in Fable 3.

55:39.000 --> 55:41.000
What will it do?

55:41.000 --> 55:43.000
I don't know.

55:43.000 --> 55:45.000
Wait until the game comes out.

55:45.000 --> 55:47.000
That's what it does.

55:47.000 --> 55:49.000
I don't know.

55:49.000 --> 55:51.000
Well, you know, there's something else going on

55:51.000 --> 55:53.000
that's, I think, a little stinky.

55:53.000 --> 55:55.000
Very much like the weapon upgrade business.

55:55.000 --> 55:57.000
And that's, um,

55:57.000 --> 55:59.000
there's a game that's called

55:59.000 --> 56:01.000
Parachute Panic that's on

56:01.000 --> 56:03.000
iPhone and iPod Touch.

56:03.000 --> 56:05.000
And, achoo!

56:05.000 --> 56:07.000
And achoo! And I'm allergic to it.

56:07.000 --> 56:09.000
Um, actually, there's dust in the room.

56:09.000 --> 56:11.000
Um, but now you, um,

56:11.000 --> 56:13.000
on the last version that came out,

56:13.000 --> 56:15.000
you can pay 99 cents to unlock

56:15.000 --> 56:17.000
another five lives.

56:17.000 --> 56:19.000
And it's a 99 cent game already.

56:19.000 --> 56:21.000
So, I mean,

56:21.000 --> 56:23.000
you can just

56:23.000 --> 56:25.000
do it in-game, but for the impatient

56:25.000 --> 56:27.000
people who want more lives, then

56:27.000 --> 56:29.000
you just pay for it. I think it's kind of stupid.

56:29.000 --> 56:31.000
And,

56:31.000 --> 56:33.000
this is, again,

56:33.000 --> 56:35.000
this kind of goes right in line with the Fable 3 story.

56:35.000 --> 56:37.000
You know, it's paying for

56:37.000 --> 56:39.000
something that,

56:39.000 --> 56:41.000
kind of a cheap upgrade

56:41.000 --> 56:43.000
in the game, I guess. But,

56:43.000 --> 56:45.000
if you don't like it, don't buy it.

56:45.000 --> 56:47.000
It's a crappy precedent to be setting.

56:47.000 --> 56:49.000
Because, unfortunately,

56:49.000 --> 56:51.000
if one person buys it,

56:51.000 --> 56:53.000
they're like, hey, that's a dollar I didn't have before

56:53.000 --> 56:55.000
to sell something like this.

56:55.000 --> 56:57.000
No, I agree. I think it's really just

56:57.000 --> 56:59.000
encouraging gamer laziness,

56:59.000 --> 57:01.000
really.

57:01.000 --> 57:03.000
It's kind of like EA and their cheat codes, remember?

57:03.000 --> 57:05.000
Stuff that normally would be in a game for free.

57:05.000 --> 57:07.000
You can sell it for two bucks.

57:07.000 --> 57:09.000
Win-win.

57:09.000 --> 57:11.000
I'm not,

57:11.000 --> 57:13.000
I don't have as much of a problem with it

57:13.000 --> 57:15.000
if it's something that you can achieve in the game

57:15.000 --> 57:17.000
otherwise, especially single player.

57:17.000 --> 57:19.000
Keep in mind when I ranted about, wow,

57:19.000 --> 57:21.000
that's a multiplayer experience,

57:21.000 --> 57:23.000
and much different. But a single player

57:23.000 --> 57:25.000
game, you know what, if you want to use

57:25.000 --> 57:27.000
cheats to your heart's content

57:27.000 --> 57:29.000
in a single player game, where you're not

57:29.000 --> 57:31.000
interacting with other people going online or what have you,

57:31.000 --> 57:33.000
go for it. And if you want to pay two bucks

57:33.000 --> 57:35.000
because you're too lazy to get it yourself, fine.

57:35.000 --> 57:37.000
But as long as the option

57:37.000 --> 57:39.000
is there for you to still get it yourself

57:39.000 --> 57:41.000
and work towards it, I think it's okay.

57:41.000 --> 57:43.000
It's just not something I would probably do.

57:43.000 --> 57:45.000
I think it's more fun if you,

57:45.000 --> 57:47.000
you know, I think anything worth having is worth

57:47.000 --> 57:49.000
working for. Even if

57:49.000 --> 57:51.000
it's in a game or not.

57:51.000 --> 57:53.000
I am behind on some chat room

57:53.000 --> 57:55.000
comments, so I want to read some comments from our chat room.

57:55.000 --> 57:57.000
chat.orangelaungeradio.com

57:57.000 --> 57:59.000
Salacious Pop says,

57:59.000 --> 58:01.000
it could just be rose colored glasses

58:01.000 --> 58:03.000
but Dreamcast's browser was pretty good.

58:03.000 --> 58:05.000
Kind of going back a ways back.

58:05.000 --> 58:07.000
Actually, yeah, it was decent. For the time.

58:07.000 --> 58:09.000
You know, you have to kind of say, okay, well,

58:09.000 --> 58:11.000
you know, that was 1999, this is

58:11.000 --> 58:13.000
before kind of web browsers were

58:13.000 --> 58:15.000
standard like that. What did Dreamcast browser

58:15.000 --> 58:17.000
have to compete with? Web TV?

58:17.000 --> 58:19.000
Yeah. So yeah, I think for its time,

58:19.000 --> 58:21.000
it was certainly pretty good.

58:21.000 --> 58:23.000
Let's see, Reddertainment says, the store

58:23.000 --> 58:25.000
in Fable 3 will be good, but the store in Fable 4

58:25.000 --> 58:27.000
will be awesome.

58:27.000 --> 58:29.000
Let's hope that it's not more of this

58:29.000 --> 58:31.000
technical and diming stuff, but I'm sure it will be.

58:31.000 --> 58:33.000
Also a question from

58:33.000 --> 58:35.000
Reddertainment, if Natal gets delayed,

58:35.000 --> 58:37.000
will Fable 3 get delayed?

58:37.000 --> 58:39.000
And Seg replies with his thought,

58:39.000 --> 58:41.000
maybe not, unless Microsoft wants it as a

58:41.000 --> 58:43.000
launch product. I assume Fable 3 is an

58:43.000 --> 58:45.000
add-on support for Natal rather than a

58:45.000 --> 58:47.000
requirement. So I guess, yeah,

58:47.000 --> 58:49.000
that's a good thought. It depends on how much Natal

58:49.000 --> 58:51.000
is integrated into this game. If it's like

58:51.000 --> 58:53.000
a required part of the game, then

58:53.000 --> 58:55.000
yeah, Natal delay is going to affect the game,

58:55.000 --> 58:57.000
but if it's just kind of a

58:57.000 --> 58:59.000
bonus little game or a bonus

58:59.000 --> 59:01.000
little quest, then maybe not.

59:01.000 --> 59:03.000
I could see that kind of being the case, is that

59:03.000 --> 59:05.000
there's a download expansion that uses Natal

59:05.000 --> 59:07.000
or something like that. It'll be kind of

59:07.000 --> 59:09.000
interesting, I suppose.

59:09.000 --> 59:11.000
So, alright.

59:11.000 --> 59:13.000
Well, moving right along

59:13.000 --> 59:15.000
into some release dates. Loki,

59:15.000 --> 59:17.000
take us through the US releases this week.

59:17.000 --> 59:19.000
Yeah, lots of good stuff this week. Of course,

59:19.000 --> 59:21.000
we were talking about DJ Hero

59:21.000 --> 59:23.000
earlier, and

59:23.000 --> 59:25.000
that will be making its way out this week

59:25.000 --> 59:27.000
on all four systems, and of course, the

59:27.000 --> 59:29.000
Renegade Edition coming out on

59:29.000 --> 59:31.000
the PlayStation 3, Xbox 360,

59:31.000 --> 59:33.000
and the Wii. Also,

59:33.000 --> 59:35.000
coming out this week, we've got

59:35.000 --> 59:37.000
Tekken 6 on PlayStation

59:37.000 --> 59:39.000
3 and Xbox 360,

59:39.000 --> 59:41.000
as well as the Fight Stick bundles for those.

59:41.000 --> 59:43.000
Hasbro Family

59:43.000 --> 59:45.000
Game Night 2 on

59:45.000 --> 59:47.000
the DS and on the Wii.

59:47.000 --> 59:49.000
World of Zoo

59:49.000 --> 59:51.000
coming out this week on the Wii and DS.

59:51.000 --> 59:53.000
SpongeBob's Truth

59:53.000 --> 59:55.000
or Square on DS, Xbox

59:55.000 --> 59:57.000
360, and the Wii.

59:57.000 --> 59:59.000
We've also got...

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:03.000
probably not from any of our listeners,

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:05.000
but Nihau, Kylan,

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:07.000
Super Game Day on the Wii

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:09.000
for your Nick Jr. fans.

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:11.000
You read a lot of game releases that

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:13.000
I don't think a single one of OLR listeners

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:15.000
care about. Hey, they may have kids that watch Nick Jr.

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:17.000
and that is important. Just saying.

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:19.000
Just saying. Also, the Backyard

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:21.000
Again is another Nick Jr. program.

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:23.000
Nerf

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:25.000
N-Strike Elite

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:27.000
with the scope

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:29.000
that's going to be coming out in a bundle for the Wii.

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:31.000
Borderlands on PC

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:33.000
also making its way out this week.

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:35.000
RE Smarter than a Fifth Grader Game Time

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:37.000
on the Wii and DS

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:39.000
and Xbox 360.

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:41.000
Pets, Dolphins,

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:43.000
and Counters on the DS.

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:45.000
Once again, another game series that puts

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:47.000
out tons of games and I'm sure they don't

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:49.000
sell very well, but hey, you know what?

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:51.000
They're putting them out and people pick them up.

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:53.000
Barbie and the

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:55.000
Three Musketeers on DS and Wii.

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:57.000
Monster

01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:59.000
4x4 Stunt Racer

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:01.000
with a pack-in wheel

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:03.000
coming to the Wii.

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:05.000
Drawn to Life, the next chapter, also on Wii

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:07.000
and DS this time.

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:09.000
Diner Dash Flow on the Go

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:11.000
is still the best title for the DS

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:13.000
title. Wow.

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:15.000
I know.

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:17.000
I was just here going, uh...

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:19.000
Some ladies might have to make a dash out of the diner

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:21.000
with Flow on the Go.

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:23.000
No one wants Flow on the Go.

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:25.000
That's always a bad thing.

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:27.000
Ben 10, Alien Force, Vilgax Attacks

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:29.000
on Playstation 2, Wii, and

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:31.000
DS and PSP.

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:33.000
Forza

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:35.000
Motorsport 3 on

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:37.000
Xbox 360.

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:39.000
CSI Deadly Intent on

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:41.000
DS and Wii.

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:43.000
I think PS3 and Xbox 360 as well.

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:45.000
This one's for Rob.

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:47.000
Press Your Luck 2010

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:49.000
coming out on PC, Wii, and

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:51.000
I believe

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:53.000
DS as well.

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:55.000
But if it's not Peter Tamarkin, then I don't give a crap

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:57.000
and I don't see how that'll be possible because he's

01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:59.000
kinda dead.

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:01.000
What's his name?

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:03.000
Todd Newton. Can't stand him.

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:05.000
He's like the worst game show host ever.

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:07.000
Reanimation. Ruined Whammy.

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:09.000
And going back to the roots of this show, Dance Dance Revolution

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:11.000
Hot Party 3 making its way out

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:13.000
from Konami. Of course, all these

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:15.000
games now kinda blend together because they all

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:17.000
kinda suck.

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:19.000
I believe also

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:21.000
kinda go with that. DDRX2

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:23.000
will be coming out as well in the bundle

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:25.000
on Playstation 2. They only sell these

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:27.000
games in a bundle now because they want you to buy those

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:29.000
crappy dance pads to go with them.

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:31.000
And Hamster

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:33.000
or Pets Hamster's Bunch

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:35.000
on PSP because god forbid

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:37.000
if the PSP be devoid of

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:39.000
crappy pet games.

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:41.000
And

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:43.000
Dream Salon on DS.

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:45.000
Now that's gonna be crap.

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:47.000
And finally, stuff coming out a week

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:49.000
from now.

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:53.000
Rabbids Go Home would be

01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:55.000
the last. Oh, Ratchet and Clank

01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:57.000
Crack in Time. That's another title that'll be coming out

01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:59.000
this week as well. I gotta read some comments

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:01.000
from chat. If you're done. I'm done.

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:03.000
Dart Tetsuya says, Sky, three words.

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:05.000
Zombie Peter Tamarkin.

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:07.000
Awesome.

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:09.000
Let's see, what else was said here? Oh, Salacious

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:11.000
Pop says, I'd play a Nick Jr.

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:13.000
Eureka's Castle FPS.

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:15.000
Hell yeah.

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:17.000
Where are the, yeah, exactly, where are the

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:19.000
Nickelodeon games for me?

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:21.000
Screw the children.

01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:23.000
I want my Nickelodeon games.

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:25.000
Like, for instance, can I get like a

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:27.000
you can't do that on television minigame collection?

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:29.000
Or like,

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:31.000
Hey dude. Hey dude, explore the ranch

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:33.000
game. Or

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:35.000
Salute your shorts. Salute your shorts.

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:37.000
You know, are you afraid of the dark?

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:39.000
The best episode of Salute your shorts

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:41.000
had to have been was at the

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:43.000
water balloon capture the flag

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:45.000
episode. My favorite.

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:47.000
Thank you, Seg.

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:49.000
Legends of the Hidden Temple.

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:51.000
Guts. Actually, they did have a Guts game

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:53.000
on Super Nintendo, didn't they? Nick Arcade.

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:55.000
Yeah, I know. How about reviving one of these

01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:57.000
old, like, classic frickin'

01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:59.000
for all I care, do a fucking

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:01.000
today's special video game. I don't care.

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:03.000
Just give me something I remember from my childhood.

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:05.000
David the Gnome.

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:07.000
The Gnome was great. Turkey Television.

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:09.000
Tell me

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:11.000
you wouldn't play a Turkey Television, like, shooting

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:13.000
game. It'd be amazing.

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:15.000
Well, they do have Chicken Shoot. That's kinda close.

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:17.000
I guess so.

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:19.000
Alright, let's go to Japanese release dates.

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:21.000
Is there anything that's gonna make us go

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:23.000
crazy this week? Probably

01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:25.000
not, because Japan's getting a lot of the titles that are

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:27.000
big and expected for us over here

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:29.000
this week. And Japanese releases this week on the

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:31.000
Xbox 360. Bayonetta makes its way

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:33.000
to the Xbox 360

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:35.000
on October 29th, as well as Tekken 6.

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:37.000
Of course, it's a big deal over there, just

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:39.000
as it is over here. Those both coming out to

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:41.000
the Xbox 360. And, of course, just in time

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:43.000
for Tekken 6, another hoary

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:45.000
arcade stick with the Tekken 6 design on it.

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:47.000
If you'd care to import one

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:49.000
of those from Japan. Or you can just get them here

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:51.000
in the bundle. Fine. Or on

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:53.000
the PlayStation 3, you could get a Bayonetta

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:55.000
there, or the, again, Tekken

01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:57.000
6. There's also a game getting a price

01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:59.000
reduction. That's Samurai Dou 3

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:01.000
Plus getting a price reduction this week.

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:03.000
So those are the big releases on the

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:05.000
360 PS3 combo.

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:07.000
Now, dipping into Nintendo Wii, we have some

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:09.000
different alternate titles. Another Dragon

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:11.000
Ball title. I'm sorry, that's

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:13.000
a US date. Chin Sports makes its

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:15.000
way to Japan. This is kind of

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:17.000
a mini-game collection that's wacky and weird

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:19.000
sports. This is the one that has

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:21.000
the Extreme Ironing. I think we talked

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:23.000
about this on the show. Oh, Wacky World of Sports? Yeah, remember we talked about, I think

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:25.000
this came up on the show a few weeks ago. It came out last month.

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:27.000
Yeah, for here in the US.

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:29.000
The Japanese are getting their own version

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:31.000
of that. Probably what people

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:33.000
care a little more about would be Sin and Punishment 2.

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:35.000
That is finally being released on the Nintendo Wii

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:37.000
this week. Super Robot

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:39.000
Taisen Nioh comes out as well, because there

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:41.000
just wasn't enough Super Robot

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:43.000
Taisen games. So another one is coming

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:45.000
out on the Wii this week. Heading on over to

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:47.000
the DS and looking at some of the games coming out

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:49.000
there on the DS,

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:51.000
we have Hakari No. 4 Senshi

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:53.000
Final Fantasy Gaiden comes

01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:55.000
out on the DS. So yes, this is from

01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:57.000
Squeenix. It's that Final Fantasy

01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:59.000
DS title that doesn't look very

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:01.000
Final Fantasy to me at all. It's kind of like

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:03.000
a spin-off game. In this game, you try

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:05.000
to defeat the Witch of the North. That's what a Gaiden is

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:07.000
as a side story. Yeah, and it's

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:09.000
that same style of like Final Fantasy

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:11.000
3 DS and the Final Fantasy 12

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:13.000
spin-off game, but don't expect

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:15.000
it to play like

01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:17.000
your other Final Fantasy games. It's a little bit

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:19.000
different.

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:21.000
You know what I miss as far as Final Fantasy

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:23.000
spin-off games go? You know what my favorite,

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:25.000
like seriously, my favorite Final Fantasy

01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:27.000
spin-off game was? Tease me all you want.

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:29.000
I fucking love Chocobo Racing.

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:31.000
That game is amazing. No, I know

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:33.000
a lot of people who love that one. I wish they would make another

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:35.000
one. I love that game.

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:37.000
It was perfect for the Wii.

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:39.000
Or give me my extreme

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:41.000
Chocobo Racing on the PlayStation 3

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:43.000
just in time for Final Fantasy 13.

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:45.000
You know, you reminded me, I forgot two major

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:47.000
titles and I don't understand how I did that.

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:49.000
Fairy Tail Fights is coming out on Xbox 360

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:51.000
and PlayStation 3. Dude, how

01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:53.000
did I forget this? Grand Theft Auto Episodes of

01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:55.000
Liberty City on Xbox 360

01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:57.000
this week. Fail. Cause I think most people think

01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:59.000
of that as a download title.

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:01.000
It's still gonna be awesome.

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:03.000
Fairy Tail Fighters, is that what it

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:05.000
sounds like? No, Fairy Tail Fights. Think of it

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:07.000
as like, um,

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:09.000
Castle Crashers but with Fairy Tail characters.

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:11.000
It's brutal. It's like

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:13.000
blood and guts everywhere. Oh, you talked about this on a

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:15.000
previous show. This sounded awesome.

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:17.000
I'm gonna have to check that out. Is it

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:19.000
cheap or is it like 60 bucks? I think it's

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:21.000
like 50. I'll wait

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:23.000
for the bargain bin cause that's...

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:25.000
You wanna talk about a game that'll end up in the bargain bin?

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:27.000
Let's see. We can't really sell

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:29.000
this game to children and adults

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:31.000
probably won't take it very seriously either.

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:33.000
Uh, we could market this to the people

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:35.000
that bought the Red Riding Hood Zombie game

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:37.000
on the DS. That's probably

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:39.000
the target market for this.

01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:41.000
It's gotta be the same company, right?

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:43.000
Nope. Right? That was Zoo

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:45.000
Games. It did, um,

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:47.000
Red Riding Hood

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:49.000
Zombie BBQ. Yeah,

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:51.000
that was it. That was the best name ever, by the way. That was an awesome game.

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:53.000
I played it at PAX, I think. It was either PAX

01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:55.000
or E3. Uh,

01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:57.000
it was PAX.

01:07:57.000 --> 01:07:59.000
Um,

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:01.000
and SalaciousPop reminded me

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:03.000
in chat there saying I only got maybe

01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:05.000
seven to eight hours in the Tactics titles.

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:07.000
I suppose Final Fantasy Tactics is a pretty notable

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:09.000
spinoff of the Final Fantasy series. Yeah.

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:11.000
But you know what's sad? I probably spent

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:13.000
more time playing Chocobo Racing than the Final

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:15.000
Fantasy Tactics games.

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:17.000
That's for sure. Uh,

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:19.000
specifically I wanted to mention on the PSP just because

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:21.000
I think this name is hilarious. It's

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:23.000
R-Type Tactics 2. Yes,

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:25.000
the R-Type Tactical game, remember that,

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:27.000
is actually getting a sequel. And the

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:29.000
sequel is called Operation

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:31.000
Bitter Chocolate.

01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:33.000
I can't make that up. That is the real name of the game.

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:35.000
Operation Bitter Chocolate.

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:37.000
So would that be Dark Chocolate? Baker's Chocolate?

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:39.000
I don't know. It's just...

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:41.000
That's what it's called. Operation Semi-Sweet

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:43.000
Chocolate. With a little bit of nuts.

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:45.000
Operation... I don't get it.

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:47.000
Couple more news stories for you

01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:49.000
guys right after the UK

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:51.000
releases. That's right. On the

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:53.000
29th we have Grand Theft Auto 4, The Ballad

01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:55.000

01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:57.000
have Aggress Generations of War

01:08:57.000 --> 01:08:59.000
Borderlands, DJ Hero

Fallout 3 Game of the Year edition,

01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:03.000
Football Manager 2010,

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:05.000
Tekken 6, Feel,

01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:07.000
that sounds dirty, Wii Fit

01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:09.000
Plus, and Yoga for Wii.

01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:11.000
Alright, we're gonna

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:13.000
get to the Classic Game of the Week very, very

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:15.000
soon here, but just two more stories for you guys

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:17.000
real quick, and then the break, and then our interview

01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:19.000
with our pal Seg about

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:21.000
Unloud right after the break tonight.

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:23.000
You know, since we

01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:25.000
were talking a little bit about

01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:27.000
Fairytale Fights, they did have an achievement at one

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:29.000
point for killing children in this.

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:31.000
So not to be outdone, of course,

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:33.000
Dante's Inferno, the game

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:35.000
full of great ideas and awesome

01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:37.000
promotions,

01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:39.000
is now getting some

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:41.000
flak for

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:43.000
an achievement called Bad Nanny.

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:45.000
And this achievement

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:47.000
is... You've been a very bad

01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:49.000
nanny, I can just see a super nanny.

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:51.000
This achievement is... You need to go and

01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:53.000
sit on the naughty step.

01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:55.000
You've been very naughty.

01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:57.000
Apparently this achievement is for killing unbaptized

01:09:57.000 --> 01:09:59.000
babies in the game.

01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:01.000
But they're demon babies,

01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:03.000
they're in hell, okay? Oh, well that makes it okay.

01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:05.000
They're demon babies, but apparently, you know,

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:07.000
the International

01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:09.000
Nanny Association, I

01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:11.000
can't make that up, has

01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:13.000
released a statement saying

01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:15.000
that it's an offense to our

01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:17.000
association.

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:19.000
Do they not have

01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:21.000
a sense of humor? I mean, this isn't saying

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:23.000
that, you know, Bad

01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:25.000
International Nanny Association

01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:27.000
or something like that. My mom was

01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:29.000
a nanny, actually, for many, many years,

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:31.000
and I can verify they do not have a sense

01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:33.000
of humor. Actually,

01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:35.000
my mom's hilarious, but I don't think she'd find that

01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:37.000
funny. Your mom's a hoot.

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:39.000
It's a video game about

01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:41.000
hell. I mean, they've got walls

01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:43.000
made out of writhing naked people.

01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:45.000
I mean, this isn't exactly,

01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:47.000
this isn't saying you should go kill babies.

01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:49.000
Just demon babies.

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:51.000
Are you saying we should go kill babies?

01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:53.000
Demon babies, okay?

01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:55.000
I mean, look at Silent Hill with the

01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:57.000
smoke babies. I mean, yes, you need to kill

01:10:57.000 --> 01:10:59.000
them because they're not human.

01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:01.000
They're trying to eat you.

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:03.000
Or something.

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:05.000
Cats aren't human. Do you kill them?

01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:07.000
No, I don't kill them.

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:09.000
But they're not demon babies, either.

01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:11.000
Well, sometimes they are, but

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:13.000
most of the time, they're not.

01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:15.000
Comment from xlink in chat chat

01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:17.000
dot orange orange radio dot com. They say no to

01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:19.000
this, but you can shoot kids in Fallout 3.

01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:21.000
Hmm.

01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:23.000
Those kids had it

01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:25.000
coming.

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:27.000
Shut up.

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:29.000
Alright, speaking of things, I told you

01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:31.000
we're coming before too long on a completely

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:33.000
different note. Remember when I said

01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:35.000
don't discount Facebook gaming?

01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:37.000
Uh oh.

01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:39.000
There is a big, big new game coming to

01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:41.000
Facebook. Civilization Network

01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:43.000
has been announced for Facebook, and in my opinion,

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:45.000
this is huge, because this is

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:47.000
what it sounds like. It is a major

01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:49.000
PC beloved franchise

01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:51.000
colliding with the world of Facebook

01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:53.000
games, and some of you are preparing your

01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:55.000
block application thing on Facebook right

01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:57.000
now, which, by the way, tangent warning.

01:11:57.000 --> 01:11:59.000
What the hell is up with those changes

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:01.000
on Facebook?

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:03.000
What changes?

01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:05.000
Ok, now they've changed it, so when you log in, you get

01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:07.000
like a news feed that seems to be like a

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:09.000
random sampling of the stuff that you would see

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:11.000
before, like the popular stories.

01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:13.000
If you want to see the live feed, you have to

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:15.000
click into that, but now the live feed

01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:17.000
shows not just people's updates, but like

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:19.000
who became friends with who,

01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:21.000
and all this stuff that you really don't want to see.

01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:23.000
All the stuff we don't care about.

01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:25.000
Yay, more stuff we get to block.

01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:27.000
But you can't block it, because if you block it, then

01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:29.000
you block the person that did the friending.

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:31.000
So yeah, Facebook didn't think that one through.

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:33.000
I know, exactly, Facebook didn't think that one through very well.

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:35.000
Anyhow, sorry, I digress.

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:37.000
Civilization Network is making its way

01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:39.000
to Facebook, and it's supposed to be out sometime

01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:41.000
in 2010. There's actually a

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:43.000
Facebook page already set up.

01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:45.000
It's on facebook.com

01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:47.000
slash civnetwork, C-I-V

01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:49.000
network, and they're going to be on the

01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:51.000
lookout for beta testers very soon.

01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:53.000
Sid Meier himself has said that the

01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:55.000
game will offer everything that people

01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:57.000
love about Civ in a quote

01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:59.000
fully persistent environment.

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:01.000
Best of all, the game

01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:03.000
will be free.

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:05.000
I like free.

01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:07.000
Brian Reynolds, who is behind Civilization 2

01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:09.000
and Alpha Centauri, has

01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:11.000
the job of chief designer at

01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:13.000
the social gaming developer site

01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:15.000
Zynga. It's kind of an interesting

01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:17.000
little coincidence. He has nothing to do with this game,

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:19.000
but it's interesting

01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:21.000
that he did so much with that now he's at this

01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:23.000
other company, so you think maybe old friends maybe

01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:25.000
got together at dinner talking about this, who knows.

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:27.000
But Facebook

01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:29.000
gaming dude, it's

01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:31.000
coming. This is going to be something we're going to

01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:33.000
see in the next few months, just get bigger and bigger.

01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:35.000
Yep.

01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:37.000
Alright, now we're going to get into a section of the show

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:39.000
that we like to get into every week. It's a section

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:41.000
for Dark Sakura to open up the gaming vault

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:43.000
and take a travel through

01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:45.000
gaming's past. It's a segment we call

01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:47.000
the Classic Game of the

01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:49.000
Week. Dark Sakura, what video game do

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:51.000
you think the kids should be playing this week?

01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:53.000
For those in the US,

01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:55.000
it is Galactic Attack.

01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:57.000
It has been

01:13:57.000 --> 01:13:59.000
known by many other names.

01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:01.000
In

01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:03.000
Japan, in the arcade, it was called

01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:05.000
Ray Force, but because of licensing

01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:07.000
it came out as a layer section

01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:09.000
on the Saturn. We got it

01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:11.000
as Galactic Attack, and in Europe they got it

01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:13.000
as Gun Lock. But it is

01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:15.000
in the Ray

01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:17.000
series, Ray Force, Ray

01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:19.000
Storm, and Ray Crisis.

01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:21.000
It's a pretty freaking amazing shooting

01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:23.000
game.

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:25.000
I love the way that it plays because

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:27.000
not only do you have the stuff coming from you

01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:29.000
from right above, you also target

01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:31.000
below your ship

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:33.000
and can launch

01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:35.000
missiles at targets in the

01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:37.000
background, or as it should be

01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:39.000
toward the bottom.

01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:41.000
Do you want to add something to that?

01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:43.000
No, unless you want to hear some of the

01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:45.000
lovely little shooting sound effects here.

01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:51.000
At least it's good.

01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:53.000
Definitely sounds like a shooting game.

01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:55.000
Bullets, bullets, and more bullets.

01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:57.000
It really is. It is

01:14:57.000 --> 01:14:59.000
just one of the

01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:01.000
regular old

01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:03.000
shooting games.

01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:05.000
I think it's one of Taito's best.

01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:07.000
I love the entire

01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:09.000
series.

01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:11.000
Ray Storm and Ray Crisis

01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:13.000
were fantastic, but

01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:15.000
this, to me, I think is what really

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:17.000
gave it to us.

01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:19.000
It's, to this day, one of my favorite

01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:21.000
shooters and one of the reasons to have

01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:23.000
a rotating widescreen monitor.

01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:25.000
That's it.

01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:27.000
Alright.

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:29.000
So there it is, your classic game of the week.

01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:31.000
It goes by several different names, right?

01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:33.000
We have Galactic Attack in the US.

01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:35.000
Gunlock in Europe.

01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:37.000
Layer Section for the Japanese

01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:39.000
home version, and in the arcade

01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:41.000
it was Ray Storm.

01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:43.000
Why couldn't they just pick one name?

01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:45.000
Because of licensing.

01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:47.000
It was fully licensing.

01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:49.000
Alright, well there you have it, your classic game of the week.

01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:51.000
Many, many different names

01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:53.000
for that one. Check it out on

01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:55.000
the Sega Saturn. Jamie loves

01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:57.000
her Sega games. Yes, she does.

01:15:57.000 --> 01:15:59.000
I sure do. Alright.

01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:01.000
Well, that's going to do it for this part A of our podcast,

01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:03.000
but don't go anywhere. We're going to be right back

01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:05.000
with plenty more in part B. We have a lot

01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:07.000
coming up on deck in part B tonight. Not only do we

01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:09.000
have some news, some

01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:11.000
quick little stories here about what's coming out

01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:13.000
on Rock Band and Xbox Live, and

01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:15.000
some news on Star Trek Online,

01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:17.000
and Beatles Rock Band, and so forth.

01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:19.000
But we have an interview coming up. Our pal

01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:21.000
Seg is the man behind a charity

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:23.000
event coming up in the Bay Area very soon

01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:25.000
known as Umlaud.

01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:27.000
And we're going to be talking to him about what's going to go down

01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:29.000
in December, just a few weeks away

01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:31.000
if you can believe it. The year's almost up.

01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:33.000
But it's all for a great cause. We're going to talk to Seg

01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:35.000
all about it right after this quick break.

01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:37.000
So don't go anywhere. We'll be right back with more

01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:39.000
of Orange Lounge Radio.

01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:09.000
It's allgamesradio.com. That's how I usually

01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:11.000
go in there. Or there's also a

01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:13.000
radio app that you can get on your iPhone if you just

01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:15.000
search for All Games in the store. They are the

01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:17.000
folks who we steal our bandwidth from every week.

01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:19.000
And we really, really appreciate

01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:21.000
it. So anyway, we're going to move into

01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:23.000
something a little different here. Usually we'll be doing

01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:25.000
Twitter topics about now, but we're actually going to invite

01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:27.000
a friend of the program on the show.

01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:29.000
And he goes by Seg online, but his name is

01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:31.000
John Segerson. He actually goes by the

01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:33.000
nickname Seg. And he is one of the minds behind

01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:35.000
Umlaud, which is a charity event that

01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:37.000
is happening in San Francisco at the DNA

01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:39.000
Lounge Wednesday, December 9th

01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:41.000
of this year, 7 p.m.

01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:43.000
to 2 a.m. It is a rock band

01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:45.000
event for Child's Play charity.

01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:47.000
And, you know, we like to talk about

01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:49.000
charity events and gamers doing

01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:51.000
good things. So we're going to give Seg a call

01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:53.000
and get him on the show to talk

01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:55.000
to us a little bit about Umlaud.

01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:57.000
So we're going to go ahead and

01:17:57.000 --> 01:17:59.000
ring him up on Skype right now

01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:01.000
and see what happens.

01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:03.000
Hello, Orange Lounge Radio.

01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:05.000
Seg, how are you? I'm doing

01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:07.000
fabulous yourself. We're very good.

01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:09.000
Hey, thank you so much for being here live tonight.

01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:11.000
You know, a little secret of Orange Lounge Radio,

01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:13.000
most of our interviews are not done live, but

01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:15.000
you were good enough to actually be here live during the

01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:17.000
show tonight and be with us live.

01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:19.000
So thank you very much. No, no, no.

01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:21.000
Thank you for having us. You know,

01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:23.000
it's, we

01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:25.000
have a great event that we want to share with people

01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:27.000
and we want to make sure everyone knows about it.

01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:29.000
Alright, well tell us all about it. I'm going to start off

01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:31.000
what is Umlaud?

01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:33.000
It's an Umlaud,

01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:35.000
or Umlaud, but louder.

01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:37.000
It's a charity

01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:39.000
event for Child's Play

01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:41.000
charity, which provides

01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:43.000
video games, toys, and other financial support

01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:45.000
to children's hospitals around the globe.

01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:47.000
And our event

01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:49.000
is we play

01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:51.000
Rock Band as

01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:53.000
a catalyst for

01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:55.000
people donating money to Child's Play.

01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:57.000
But now, is

01:18:57.000 --> 01:18:59.000
Rock Band the only thing that's going on at this event

01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:01.000
or is this kind of like just a big party where Rock Band's

01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:03.000
kind of in the corner? How does this work?

01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:05.000
Well, actually, this is going to be

01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:07.000
a very different

01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:09.000
kind of Rock Band night than

01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:11.000
most Rock Band

01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:13.000
nights. I mean, usually when people go out

01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:15.000
to do Rock Band

01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:17.000
at like a bar or something, you know, it's there, but it's

01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:19.000
you know, it's just everyone playing

01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:21.000
to a projector and all that.

01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:23.000
We're doing something a little bit

01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:25.000
more.

01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:27.000
We'll have one area

01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:29.000
of just regular Rock Band play,

01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:31.000
no fuss or anything, in the upstairs

01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:33.000
lounge area. But

01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:35.000
for the main event,

01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:37.000
you're playing Rock Band on

01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:39.000
the DNA lounge

01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:41.000
stage, a San Francisco concert

01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:43.000
venue. And you'll be performing

01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:45.000
Rock Band as a band

01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:47.000
on a concert stage to an audience.

01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:49.000
So it's more than just

01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:51.000
just playing Rock Band to the projector

01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:53.000
and all that. You're actually, you are

01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:55.000
putting on a

01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:57.000
rock concert

01:19:57.000 --> 01:19:59.000
for people. And

01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:01.000
depending on what kind of

01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:03.000
band package you donate to,

01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:05.000
you can really get the

01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:07.000
ultimate rock concert performance

01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:09.000
experience with the lighting, band

01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:11.000
introduction, the whole nine yards.

01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:13.000
Tell us a little more about some of these different experiences

01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:15.000
that, you know, Rock Band

01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:17.000
wannabes or however you want to phrase it,

01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:19.000
because you talk about how you can

01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:21.000
actually get up on a real stage that

01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:23.000
quote unquote real bands are performed

01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:25.000
up on. I mean, is that something that's

01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:27.000
accessible to everybody, or what are the different options

01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:29.000
for my band to showcase at this event?

01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:31.000
So, first of all,

01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:33.000
I do want to say that we do have two

01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:35.000
stages, and one stage is free for

01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:37.000
anybody to show up, and we'll get in a little

01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:39.000
later of

01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:41.000
what everybody can do.

01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:43.000
But if you and three of

01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:45.000
your friends really want

01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:47.000
to perform on the main stage,

01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:49.000
we have two

01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:51.000
packages to perform on the main stage.

01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:53.000
There's a standard band package,

01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:55.000
which we're going to

01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:57.000
ask for a $40 donation,

01:20:57.000 --> 01:20:59.000
but if you order online, it's $35.

01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:01.000
And that's the whole band.

01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:03.000
So if you split that up to four people,

01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:05.000
that's $8.75

01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:07.000
a person.

01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:09.000
And for the standard band package, you get to

01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:11.000
play on the stage. You just

01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:13.000
play on the stage regularly, but you're still playing

01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:15.000
to the crowd on a major San Francisco

01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:17.000
stage. Now if you want to rock

01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:19.000
harder,

01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:21.000
that's where our ultimate band package comes in.

01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:23.000
If you want to put some extra oomph in your oomph

01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:25.000
loud. Exactly.

01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:27.000
And we're asking

01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:29.000
for $120

01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:31.000
for the donation, but again, that's the band

01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:33.000
package, so it amounts to $30. And you get

01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:35.000
a little bit,

01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:37.000
you get more into it

01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:39.000
with this package, where

01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:41.000
you first get to reserve

01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:43.000
your song ahead of time, and we are going to have

01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:45.000
a rule with just the main stage

01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:47.000
that once a song's

01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:49.000
played, it's not going to be played again.

01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:51.000
And we're doing that

01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:53.000
because we will have

01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:55.000
every

01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:57.000
song on rock band

01:21:57.000 --> 01:21:59.000
available. Nice. We actually partnered

01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:01.000
up with Harmonix with this, and they will be

01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:03.000
providing

01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:05.000
stuff that can be played on rock

01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:07.000
band two, but all of it.

01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:09.000
So there's those few

01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:11.000
songs on rock band one

01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:13.000
that won't be included.

01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:15.000
And Beatles doesn't count for

01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:17.000
the main stage, because it's just hard to

01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:19.000
get people through without

01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:21.000
switching discs. Yeah, you don't want to have to switch discs all the time.

01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:23.000
That makes sense. Is it still like, what, a thousand songs

01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:25.000
to pick from? Yeah, it's about a thousand

01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:27.000
songs, you know. So

01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:29.000
we feel we're comfortable in doing this because

01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:31.000
it'd be pretty lame to have the same

01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:33.000
song played

01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:35.000
again. So if you're

01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:37.000
in the ultimate band package, you get to reserve it ahead of time.

01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:39.000
So that's

01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:41.000
one thing. You also

01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:43.000
get, each member of your band

01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:45.000
will get lanyards,

01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:47.000
you know, that sort of VIP pass

01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:49.000
thing.

01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:51.000
That's a nice little take-home memento. You also

01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:53.000
get, you'll get a gift bag for each

01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:55.000
band member,

01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:57.000
four bags.

01:22:57.000 --> 01:22:59.000
And when you're about

01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:01.000
to go on stage, you'll be introduced as your

01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:03.000
band. You have to pick a name for your band, and we'll make

01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:05.000
an introduction for you.

01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:07.000
And we get

01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:09.000
the lighting guy involved, and it

01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:11.000
just really makes it

01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:13.000
the kind of experience you

01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:15.000
really can't

01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:17.000
get anywhere with it. Did you get the rock band

01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:19.000
Fog Machine? Who needs the

01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:21.000
Fog Machine? You'll have the full

01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:23.000
lighting setup of the

01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:25.000
DNA Lounges concert

01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:27.000
venue stage. I guess true enough.

01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:29.000
You get industrial strength.

01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:31.000
Yes, you get the industrial strength

01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:33.000
concert. Fair enough, fair enough.

01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:35.000
And for those folks that are thinking, oh my gosh,

01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:37.000
$120, that's a lot of money, keep in mind

01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:39.000
this is, you know, a

01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:41.000
once in a, you know, never

01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:43.000
type experience that you can get getting a play on the

01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:45.000
stage, and B, the fact that it's

01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:47.000
going to charity. I mean, it's not like going in

01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:49.000
Sake's pocket, it's going to a great charity.

01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:51.000
Yes, it's going to Child's Play.

01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:53.000
We really want to stress that this

01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:55.000
is a donation, and

01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:57.000
we are, the

01:23:57.000 --> 01:23:59.000
money that you give is going to

01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:01.000
Child's Play.

01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:03.000
So it's, you know, I mean,

01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:05.000
if you stood back and just saw it as

01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:07.000
the value of just like, what would I pay

01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:09.000
just to play rock band? It's, you're

01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:11.000
kind of thinking it a little

01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:13.000
wrong in this context. This is

01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:15.000
a donation to which we are

01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:17.000
thanking you by giving you this experience.

01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:19.000
And plus it's just a chance to kind of get together

01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:21.000
with other nerds and have a good time. Yes, exactly.

01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:23.000
Now, here's the thing, is this because

01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:25.000
it's a rock concert, is it 18 up,

01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:27.000
21 and up, or? No, it is an all

01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:29.000
ages show at DNA Lounge.

01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:31.000
Yeah, we like to

01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:33.000
say it's T for teen and that, you know,

01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:35.000
we don't want people to think that

01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:37.000
because it's for Child's

01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:39.000
Play charity that it's for little kids.

01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:41.000
True. Just, you know, but it's

01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:43.000
an all ages show. Because if someone gets up

01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:45.000
on stage and doesn't censor the lyrics

01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:47.000
to a song that may have the F word in it, you

01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:49.000
don't want no one to get offended. Yeah.

01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:51.000
But it's all in good fun.

01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:53.000
But let me talk about, you know, I've been talking

01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:55.000
about the band packages, which is definitely the

01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:57.000
higher end stuff. Please do.

01:24:57.000 --> 01:24:59.000
But I really,

01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:01.000
for people who don't, you know, don't

01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:03.000
want to perform and all that,

01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:05.000
it is a free

01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:07.000
event. We won't turn

01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:09.000
anyone away if they don't pay at the door.

01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:11.000
We are asking for a $10

01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:13.000
donation because

01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:15.000
this is a charity event.

01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:17.000
But no one will be turned

01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:19.000
away. And even if you don't

01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:21.000
do the donation, you will get two

01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:23.000
raffle tickets for our prize

01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:25.000
raffle. And our prize raffle

01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:27.000
is stuff that we've been

01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:29.000
that

01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:31.000
my co-words Chris

01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:33.000
Fuller, Joe Marquette, have been

01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:35.000
collecting throughout

01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:37.000
the year of all this swag and all this stuff

01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:39.000
and they've been piling up in their

01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:41.000
apartments. And we're going to

01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:43.000
give the stuff away as prizes

01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:45.000
in this free raffle.

01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:47.000
So there's a lot of incentive there.

01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:49.000
And actually Chris is doing

01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:51.000
a prize a day on our blog at

01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:53.000
umloud.org

01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:55.000
that's umloud.org

01:25:55.000 --> 01:25:57.000
where he'll take a

01:25:57.000 --> 01:25:59.000
photo of some of the things that he'll have

01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:01.000
and post it so you can see

01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:03.000
the kinds of things that we'll be

01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:05.000
giving away on that night.

01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:07.000
Now I know this is an event

01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:09.000
that's being hosted at the DNA Lounge which is

01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:11.000
on 11th Street in San Francisco and again

01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:13.000
the date and time if you missed it, December 9th, 2009

01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:15.000
that's a Wednesday, 7 p.m.

01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:17.000
till 2 a.m. like most bars are open till

01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:19.000
2 a.m. But what if

01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:21.000
we have listeners all over the globe really?

01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:23.000
How can people help out if they can't

01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:25.000
be there in San Francisco on that night?

01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:27.000
Yes, I know

01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:29.000
our event is around San Francisco

01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:31.000
and all that, but if you can't make it to San Francisco

01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:33.000
or any of the other

01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:35.000
kinds of events that are

01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:37.000
happening, please

01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:39.000
consider a donation to

01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:41.000
Child's Play Charity.

01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:43.000
Just go directly to them.

01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:45.000
They're childsplaycharity.org

01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:47.000
and just consider

01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:49.000
a donation direct to them.

01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:51.000
We're doing this thing here in San Francisco

01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:53.000
because of the success of

01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:55.000
Fundrazer last year and a lot of

01:26:55.000 --> 01:26:57.000
people liked it and it's the kind of thing that we know

01:26:57.000 --> 01:26:59.000
that a lot of

01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:01.000
people come to and we want to

01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:03.000
facilitate that, but what we're really

01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:05.000
here is to show

01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:07.000
to create

01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:09.000
awareness to Child's Play Charity

01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:11.000
as a whole and this is

01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:13.000
one micro chasm of the

01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:15.000
many things going on in the gaming

01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:17.000
community to help Child's

01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:19.000
Play Charity. Well I think it's a

01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:21.000
great cause and it's a really fun event and you know

01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:23.000
if nothing else, even if people are like shy

01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:25.000
you know one thing that should be said is that

01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:27.000
this isn't just for people

01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:29.000
that love attention of getting up on stage and all

01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:31.000
that. If you just kind of want to come hang with

01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:33.000
cool people, come to this event

01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:35.000
because I'm going to be there and I believe

01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:37.000
Dark Soccer is going to be there and we're trying to

01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:39.000
get Loki there so hopefully we'll all be there

01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:41.000
so come hang with us. Yes and we'll definitely have

01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:43.000
more, I mean there's stuff that we're

01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:45.000
working on and I can't really put on, you know

01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:47.000
say right now, but don't feel

01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:49.000
that just because you didn't pay

01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:51.000
for, you know you didn't get the package

01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:53.000
the band package thing that there's nothing

01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:55.000
for you. There will be plenty

01:27:55.000 --> 01:27:57.000
of things for you to do. You will have a good time

01:27:57.000 --> 01:27:59.000
just showing up so please

01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:01.000
please come by

01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:03.000
we'd love to have you

01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:05.000
it's again for

01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:07.000
all the information of this, there are many

01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:09.000
other things, please come to our website

01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:11.000
umloud.org

01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:13.000
that's u-m-l-o-u-d.org

01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:15.000
and we hope to see you there.

01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:17.000
And I just wanted to mention this real quick

01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:19.000
I'm kind of glancing through chat here and I see Tiger

01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:21.000
Claw in chat says something about DNA

01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:23.000
Lounge seems to have like a live

01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:25.000
video stream? Oh yes

01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:27.000
that's right, yes there will be a live video stream

01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:29.000
that will be turned on

01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:31.000
during our events so

01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:33.000
you can also see us

01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:35.000
rock out, all the

01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:37.000
bands, it's

01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:39.000
going to be centered on the main stage

01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:41.000
I believe and you

01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:43.000
can view it from anywhere

01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:45.000
during the night as well. Oh well now we

01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:47.000
have to figure out a way to get up on that main stage

01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:49.000
so that the listeners around can see

01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:51.000
it so we're going to have to try and get Loki there

01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:53.000
if he can't make it we'll get some of our friends to come

01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:55.000
so we can get our president cat

01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:57.000
band up on stage

01:28:57.000 --> 01:28:59.000
and do order soon because we only have

01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:01.000
a limited amount of the band packages

01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:03.000
so we really

01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:05.000
if you really want to do

01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:07.000
it, get on the boat soon

01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:09.000
to do the band packages

01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:11.000
we'll have a few of the standard on hand

01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:13.000
but that's sort of our release valve

01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:15.000
to make sure that everyone who's

01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:17.000
paid for a package gets to play on the stage

01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:19.000
and we're also increasing the price

01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:21.000
a little more

01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:23.000
on the night of for the standard band package

01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:25.000
so if you really want to do that

01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:27.000
if you think, if you

01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:29.000
really

01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:31.000
want to do this, please order

01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:33.000
soon than later

01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:35.000
Alright, so once again this is

01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:37.000
Um Loud happening Wednesday

01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:39.000

more information is available on their website

01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:47.000

01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:49.000

fun spots too, right?

01:29:53.000 --> 01:29:55.000
Yes, it's amazing how many

01:29:55.000 --> 01:29:57.000
things can and cannot use the

01:29:57.000 --> 01:29:59.000

And that's so important for an event like this

01:30:01.000 --> 01:30:03.000
It's so important

01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:05.000
But don't worry, you don't have to figure out how to type it into your computer

01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:07.000
to get to the website, just a normal You

01:30:07.000 --> 01:30:09.000

Best of luck with the event and we'll be there

01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:15.000
Thank you guys, we had to rebrand this event

01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:17.000
a week and a half ago

01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:19.000
So

01:30:19.000 --> 01:30:21.000

or relative or someone who likes

01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:41.000
video games that might see you following

01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:43.000

01:30:43.000 --> 01:30:45.000

Um Loud and a great event for

01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:49.000
Child's Play Charity

01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:51.000
Alright, Seg, thank you so much

01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:53.000
Thank you, take care

01:30:53.000 --> 01:30:55.000
That was our friend John

01:30:55.000 --> 01:30:57.000
Segerson who goes by the

01:30:57.000 --> 01:30:59.000
Monkier Seg online

01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:01.000
putting on Um Loud

01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:03.000
Sounds like a lot of fun, Jamie, I don't know about you

01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:05.000
but I'm ready to turn it to 11 at this event

01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:07.000
Let's go

01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:09.000
We need to get mullet wigs

01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:11.000
I'm all for dressing up

01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:13.000
We need the rock mullet

01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:15.000
Come on, buddy

01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:17.000
We'll see if I can make it down there

01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:19.000
Alright, alright, at least we got upgraded from

01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:21.000
an I don't know to a we'll see

01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:23.000
so that's usually good

01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:25.000
Anyhow, we'll get to more Skype calls a little later on in the show

01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:27.000
I want to thank our buddy Seg for tuning in live

01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:29.000
and being here with us live

01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:31.000
We've got plenty more show for you

01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:33.000
including some rapid fire news and I believe

01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:35.000
right into a story about rock band

01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:37.000
some more songs you can play at this event

01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:39.000
Exactly, some more songs you may be able to play

01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:41.000
during the event

01:31:41.000 --> 01:31:43.000
This week we're getting new tracks from Rob Zombie

01:31:43.000 --> 01:31:45.000
and Wolf Mother

01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:47.000
among other things

01:31:47.000 --> 01:31:49.000
They've got a whole variety pack here

01:31:49.000 --> 01:31:51.000
Looks like some morning wood tracks as well

01:31:51.000 --> 01:31:53.000
Anyways, starting things off

01:31:53.000 --> 01:31:55.000
Rob Zombie pack 1

01:31:55.000 --> 01:31:57.000
which I got to say has got some sweet

01:31:57.000 --> 01:31:59.000
songs in it, definitely something I'm going to be

01:31:59.000 --> 01:32:01.000
purchasing

01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:03.000
including Burn, Dragula, and Superbeast

01:32:03.000 --> 01:32:05.000
It's about freaking time Dragula's in the game

01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:07.000
Hell yes

01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:09.000
What song are we going to sing?

01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:11.000
That would be a perfect song

01:32:11.000 --> 01:32:13.000
You want to do Dragula?

01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:15.000
I can get up on there and do my best Rob Zombie

01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:17.000
I'll have to get a big curly wig or something

01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:19.000
We'll figure something out

01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:21.000
Anyways, the Wolf Mother pack 1

01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:23.000
is going to have five tracks

01:32:23.000 --> 01:32:25.000
and that will include

01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:27.000
New Moon Rising, Pilgrim, Sundial,

01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:29.000
White Unicorn, and Woman

01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:31.000
Finally, they have a few individual songs

01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:33.000
including

01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:35.000
Liz Fair, Rock Me, Morning Wood Best of Me

01:32:35.000 --> 01:32:37.000
and Morning Wood

01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:39.000
Sugar Baby

01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:41.000
and each of those are available

01:32:41.000 --> 01:32:43.000
Actually, the Morning Wood tracks are half off

01:32:43.000 --> 01:32:45.000
so it's only a buck

01:32:45.000 --> 01:32:47.000
or 80 Microsoft points

01:32:47.000 --> 01:32:49.000
Everything else individually is

01:32:49.000 --> 01:32:51.000
$1.99 or 200

01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:53.000
Wii points or

01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:55.000
160 Microsoft points

01:32:55.000 --> 01:32:57.000
and of course the packs are a little bit cheaper

01:32:57.000 --> 01:32:59.000
The Rob Zombie pack is $549

01:32:59.000 --> 01:33:01.000
or 440 Microsoft points

01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:03.000
680

01:33:03.000 --> 01:33:05.000
Microsoft points for the Wolf Mother pack

01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:07.000
or $849 in real money

01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:09.000
and then of course the

01:33:09.000 --> 01:33:11.000
PSP, they're getting

01:33:11.000 --> 01:33:13.000
Sonic Youth, Cool Thing

01:33:13.000 --> 01:33:15.000
and Stealing and My Old School

01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:17.000
both of those for two bucks

01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:19.000
and then they go along

01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:21.000
with releases

01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:23.000
Konami has confirmed that

01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:25.000
they're going to be releasing a

01:33:25.000 --> 01:33:27.000
port of Shadow of Destiny

01:33:27.000 --> 01:33:29.000
which came out I believe on PlayStation 2

01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:31.000
not too long ago

01:33:31.000 --> 01:33:33.000
and

01:33:33.000 --> 01:33:35.000
yeah

01:33:35.000 --> 01:33:37.000
I guess it's nice to see them actually

01:33:37.000 --> 01:33:39.000
putting out some new games and stuff

01:33:39.000 --> 01:33:41.000
and the game is

01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:43.000
I guess

01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:45.000
comparing it to Groundhog Day

01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:47.000
but I guess to the point where

01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:49.000
the person dies

01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:51.000
over and over and over again

01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:53.000
I don't know, I remember it being a pretty decent game

01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:55.000
when it came out on PlayStation 2

01:33:55.000 --> 01:33:57.000
Alright, well speaking of release dates

01:33:57.000 --> 01:33:59.000
it's not very often we're talking about a game coming out early

01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:01.000
in fact this year it's been talking about all these games

01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:03.000
getting delayed to 2010

01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:05.000
but Need for Speed Nitro

01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:07.000
that's the new Need for Speed entry on the Nintendo Wii and DS

01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:09.000
has had its release bumped up

01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:11.000
it was originally going to come out November 17th

01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:13.000
but guess what, it's now coming out

01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:15.000
November 3rd here in the US

01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:17.000
and November 6th over in Europe

01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:19.000
so it actually got out a little early

01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:21.000
I actually checked this out at E3

01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:23.000
it was pretty cool for a Wii game

01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:25.000
I know that sounds kind of harsh

01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:27.000
but usually when you think Need for Speed and racing games

01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:29.000
you think, oh the top of the line graphics

01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:31.000
you're not going to get that on the Wii

01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:33.000
but it was a good arcade game

01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:35.000
for arcade silly fun

01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:37.000
it was pretty cool

01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:39.000
it didn't really feel like other Need for Speed games to me

01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:41.000
but maybe that's just me

01:34:41.000 --> 01:34:43.000
on Xbox Live, Rainbow Islands

01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:45.000
Towering Adventure is coming out on Xbox Live

01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:47.000
yes, that would be Rainbow Islands

01:34:47.000 --> 01:34:49.000
that game that was once inspired

01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:51.000
by Bubble Bobble

01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:53.000
it was kind of like a sequel to Bubble Bobble

01:34:53.000 --> 01:34:55.000
it was a little different, it was still Bub and Bob

01:34:55.000 --> 01:34:57.000
but they were shooting rainbows

01:34:57.000 --> 01:34:59.000
although I noticed in the screenshots for this game

01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:01.000
I don't see Bub and Bob

01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:03.000
it's like a new little guy here

01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:05.000
so this is some new little spinoff game

01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:07.000
it's Rainbow Islands Towering Adventure

01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:09.000
it is actually a port of a WiiWare game

01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:11.000
that came out a little while ago

01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:13.000
so it's coming out very, very soon

01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:15.000
also for those who are in Europe

01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:17.000
and can make it and are interested

01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:19.000
there's some playable Star Trek Online

01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:21.000
at Eurogamer Expo

01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:23.000
they're almost out of tickets too

01:35:23.000 --> 01:35:25.000
but that's on Wednesday the 28th

01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:27.000
in Leeds

01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:29.000
and yeah, they're almost sold out

01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:31.000
but you can actually

01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:35.000
play on one of the gaming PCs there

01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:37.000
and

01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:41.000
it's different level demos

01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:43.000
you can do ship to ship and planet combat

01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:45.000
and you can

01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:47.000
shoot Klingons in space

01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:49.000
and you can actually

01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:51.000
I think play as Klingons

01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:53.000
in that one too

01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:55.000
and also you can go visit

01:35:55.000 --> 01:35:57.000
the giant lopsided donut

01:35:57.000 --> 01:35:59.000
I mean the Guardian of Forever

01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:01.000
so, should be fun

01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:05.000
and

01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:07.000
Bayonetta

01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:09.000
Bayonetta has done something major

01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:11.000
it is the first Xbox 360 game

01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:13.000
that got a perfect score from Famitsu

01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:15.000
it got a perfect 40-40

01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:17.000
although now Bayonetta is cross platform

01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:19.000
it just happens that Xbox 360

01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:21.000
is one of the platforms it's on, correct?

01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:23.000
and also the better version

01:36:23.000 --> 01:36:25.000
yeah, the other one got 38

01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:27.000
oh, so they did review both

01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:29.000
I didn't know that Famitsu did that

01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:31.000
very interesting

01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:33.000
well, there are, if you actually

01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:35.000
look for movies on YouTube

01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:37.000
of them side by side

01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:39.000
you will see a noticeable difference

01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:41.000
interesting, now Famitsu magazine

01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:43.000
doesn't hand out 40s very often

01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:45.000
although it seems like we've had a few of these stories

01:36:45.000 --> 01:36:47.000
in the past few years

01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:49.000
sometimes you kind of raise an eyebrow at the games they give 40s to

01:36:49.000 --> 01:36:51.000
like, I believe Nintendogs was one of their 40 titles

01:36:51.000 --> 01:36:53.000
but, you know, there's a lot of

01:36:53.000 --> 01:36:55.000
really, really great games in the past

01:36:55.000 --> 01:36:57.000
like Final Fantasy XII and so forth that got this as well

01:36:57.000 --> 01:36:59.000
so it definitely is a distinction, I think only what a dozen games

01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:01.000
in the history of the magazine have had it

01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:03.000
I think so, Famitsu is really tough

01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:05.000
so Bayonetta, getting that is a big, like, whoa

01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:07.000
whoa, hello

01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:09.000
well, I'm totally getting Bayonetta

01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:11.000
at the game, or just

01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:13.000
we're only hearing about the 40s right now

01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:15.000
I think it's just the 40s so far

01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:17.000
let me double check

01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:19.000
Salacious Pop clarifies, by the way

01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:21.000
they gave the PS3 version of 38 because the port

01:37:21.000 --> 01:37:23.000
is muddy and bad, it looks brown

01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:25.000
and is missing quite a bit of particles

01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:27.000
ouch

01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:29.000
yeah, they're not really saying why

01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:31.000
but yeah, just seriously, look at them side by side

01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:33.000
38's still not bad

01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:35.000
that's why it's intense, it's like, oh, it's crappy

01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:37.000
I think President Cat

01:37:37.000 --> 01:37:39.000
got, what, like a 24

01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:41.000
from Famitsu, but they're kind of

01:37:41.000 --> 01:37:43.000
yeah, they're used to seeing these games a lot

01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:45.000
too, I think it's a lot different for them

01:37:45.000 --> 01:37:47.000
than it was for us, maybe like a generic party game

01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:49.000
coming out over here on the Wii, I mean

01:37:49.000 --> 01:37:51.000
those are, you know, a dime a dozen

01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:53.000
whereas Cat Games, there's two

01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:55.000
maybe a little bit more, but

01:37:55.000 --> 01:37:57.000
about a handful

01:37:57.000 --> 01:37:59.000
alright, moving on to

01:37:59.000 --> 01:38:01.000
some more gaming news

01:38:01.000 --> 01:38:03.000
and your phone calls a little later on tonight

01:38:03.000 --> 01:38:05.000
in the mailbag, we still have that to get to

01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:07.000
controller patent, this controller

01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:09.000
looks odd

01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:11.000
and, well, I guess it's

01:38:11.000 --> 01:38:13.000
normal for them, since they have the Cosmic Ice Cream

01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:15.000
cone, but this controller

01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:17.000
looks like, it's like a cylinder with

01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:19.000
the end cut off and four buttons on it

01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:21.000
no word on what

01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:23.000
the hell this is going to be used for, possibly

01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:25.000
designed for their new remote

01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:27.000
their motion controller device

01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:29.000
sans

01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:31.000
ice cream, I guess

01:38:31.000 --> 01:38:33.000
but

01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:35.000
this world looks like a sex toy

01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:37.000
too, so, I don't know

01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:41.000
uh, that sounds kinda gross

01:38:41.000 --> 01:38:43.000
yeah

01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:45.000
hmm

01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:47.000
but, uh, so this is not like

01:38:47.000 --> 01:38:49.000
these are actually coming

01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:51.000
out, this is just a list of

01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:53.000
this is what could have been, or what is this

01:38:53.000 --> 01:38:55.000
it's a design, they may go with it

01:38:55.000 --> 01:38:57.000
they may not go with it, it's just like, you know

01:38:57.000 --> 01:38:59.000
Nintendo with their inflatable chair of

01:38:59.000 --> 01:39:01.000
fun, you know, it might come out

01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:03.000
it might not, it's just an idea

01:39:03.000 --> 01:39:05.000
I thought everything was sold on the whole, like, lights thing

01:39:05.000 --> 01:39:07.000
or the changing light dot

01:39:07.000 --> 01:39:09.000
beam looking thing, now

01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:11.000
I thought that's what we were going at

01:39:11.000 --> 01:39:13.000
well, maybe they decided to change

01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:15.000
the way they look, maybe the

01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:17.000
maybe there's a light on here

01:39:17.000 --> 01:39:19.000
that we don't see or something, I don't know

01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:21.000
to me it looks like a plastic cylinder that

01:39:21.000 --> 01:39:23.000
has four buttons on top

01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:25.000
well, you know what though

01:39:25.000 --> 01:39:27.000
I don't, I don't

01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:29.000
I have a lot of faith in Sony when it comes to

01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:31.000
controller design, because I still love

01:39:31.000 --> 01:39:33.000
the PlayStation controllers, although then again

01:39:33.000 --> 01:39:35.000
I say that and then at the same time I think

01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:37.000
yeah, but then they did take DualShock out of the PS3

01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:39.000
but that was a whole different reason, that wasn't really a design

01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:41.000
well it's because they didn't want to pay royalties

01:39:41.000 --> 01:39:43.000
but, you know, the

01:39:43.000 --> 01:39:45.000
PlayStation 3 controller is still a rock solid

01:39:45.000 --> 01:39:47.000
controller, especially, you know, and I

01:39:47.000 --> 01:39:49.000
took some crap last week for saying this, but

01:39:49.000 --> 01:39:51.000
especially compared to the 360 controller, which

01:39:51.000 --> 01:39:53.000
you know, the D-pad leaves a lot

01:39:53.000 --> 01:39:55.000
to be desired on the 360 controller

01:39:55.000 --> 01:39:57.000
the PS3 is a pretty slick controller

01:39:57.000 --> 01:39:59.000
especially the newer ones, so you know

01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:01.000
I kind of trust their judgement when it comes to

01:40:01.000 --> 01:40:03.000
making controllers, they usually don't make bad ones

01:40:03.000 --> 01:40:05.000
except that boomerang thing was really weird

01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:07.000
but that never did come out

01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:09.000
that was only a concept thing, so

01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:11.000
maybe that light thing went the way of the boomerang

01:40:11.000 --> 01:40:13.000
but thankfully we do live in the day

01:40:13.000 --> 01:40:15.000
and the age of the internet

01:40:15.000 --> 01:40:17.000
because if this was like, you know

01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:19.000
the mid 90s where all we had were gaming magazines

01:40:19.000 --> 01:40:21.000
that boomerang would have come out

01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:23.000
possibly, because they wouldn't have heard

01:40:23.000 --> 01:40:25.000
the horrible feedback

01:40:25.000 --> 01:40:27.000
I don't think, I don't know

01:40:27.000 --> 01:40:29.000
this is like a debate that's years old at this point

01:40:29.000 --> 01:40:31.000
but I don't know if the boomerang was necessarily a bad

01:40:31.000 --> 01:40:33.000
thing, I'd have to feel it in my hands

01:40:33.000 --> 01:40:35.000
if it felt fine to control with

01:40:35.000 --> 01:40:37.000
I would have been okay with the weird design

01:40:37.000 --> 01:40:39.000
but I just think at the same time

01:40:39.000 --> 01:40:41.000
the PlayStation controller is like one of the

01:40:41.000 --> 01:40:43.000
best controllers ever, why ruin

01:40:43.000 --> 01:40:45.000
a good thing? You know, look at the PS1

01:40:45.000 --> 01:40:47.000
PS2, PS3 controllers, they've all

01:40:47.000 --> 01:40:49.000
been pretty much the same, and there's a reason for that

01:40:49.000 --> 01:40:51.000
you know, granted they added

01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:53.000
rumble to it at some point along the way

01:40:53.000 --> 01:40:55.000
they added dual, you know, and all that

01:40:55.000 --> 01:40:57.000
pretty much though it stayed consistent

01:40:59.000 --> 01:41:01.000
alright, moving on to another

01:41:01.000 --> 01:41:03.000
news story having to do with Beatles Rock Band

01:41:03.000 --> 01:41:05.000
Beatles Rock Band

01:41:05.000 --> 01:41:07.000
has actually beaten Guitar Hero 5

01:41:07.000 --> 01:41:09.000
on the sales chart

01:41:09.000 --> 01:41:11.000
this is based on US September

01:41:11.000 --> 01:41:13.000
sales, yeah, believe it or not

01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:15.000
the Beatles

01:41:15.000 --> 01:41:17.000
was released September 9th and Guitar Hero 5

01:41:17.000 --> 01:41:19.000
was released September 1st, the Beatles has moved

01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:21.000
595,000

01:41:21.000 --> 01:41:23.000
units to 499

01:41:23.000 --> 01:41:25.000
units of Guitar Hero 5

01:41:25.000 --> 01:41:27.000
granted that's really close

01:41:27.000 --> 01:41:29.000
but also it should be noted that

01:41:29.000 --> 01:41:31.000
the All You Need Is Love download track

01:41:31.000 --> 01:41:33.000
100,000 downloads

01:41:33.000 --> 01:41:35.000
in September, so this is only

01:41:35.000 --> 01:41:37.000
considering September, it's not considering the

01:41:37.000 --> 01:41:39.000
important Christmas period, I don't want to start

01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:41.000
all this like OMG Guitar Hero 5

01:41:41.000 --> 01:41:43.000
but it is a little surprising

01:41:43.000 --> 01:41:45.000
considering Beatles

01:41:45.000 --> 01:41:47.000
Rock Band to some was kind of a niche title

01:41:47.000 --> 01:41:49.000
I don't think it is

01:41:49.000 --> 01:41:51.000
surprising to me because they went all out

01:41:51.000 --> 01:41:53.000
with Guitar Hero 5 as far as trying to get people

01:41:53.000 --> 01:41:55.000
to buy it, I mean they were throwing in a free game

01:41:55.000 --> 01:41:57.000
even, you know, to really push that first

01:41:57.000 --> 01:41:59.000
month numbers and it failed

01:41:59.000 --> 01:42:01.000
is this a sign that people are

01:42:01.000 --> 01:42:03.000
kind of wising up to the 50,000

01:42:03.000 --> 01:42:05.000
releases in a year?

01:42:05.000 --> 01:42:07.000
I don't know, it'll be

01:42:07.000 --> 01:42:09.000
interesting to see what's going to happen

01:42:09.000 --> 01:42:11.000
I'm not remotely surprised, I'm surprised it didn't sell more

01:42:11.000 --> 01:42:13.000
a lot of people are actually surprised

01:42:13.000 --> 01:42:15.000
the Beatles game didn't sell more, but of course

01:42:15.000 --> 01:42:17.000
you know, this game will move throughout

01:42:17.000 --> 01:42:19.000
Christmas, I mean both of these games

01:42:19.000 --> 01:42:21.000
are still going to continue to move, but it is a very

01:42:21.000 --> 01:42:23.000
I mean, doesn't Guitar Hero, I mean, just taking

01:42:23.000 --> 01:42:25.000
the whole Beatles thing out of it, doesn't

01:42:25.000 --> 01:42:27.000
Guitar Hero usually tend to beat Rock Band

01:42:27.000 --> 01:42:29.000
on sales chart? Well

01:42:29.000 --> 01:42:31.000
it depends who you're asking because

01:42:31.000 --> 01:42:33.000
they

01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:35.000
say, yeah, we've sold more units, well yeah

01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:37.000
you have like five times as many

01:42:37.000 --> 01:42:39.000
games coming out, so yes, you've sold

01:42:39.000 --> 01:42:41.000
more units, I see, but

01:42:41.000 --> 01:42:43.000
so you can't really

01:42:43.000 --> 01:42:45.000
trust those numbers

01:42:45.000 --> 01:42:47.000
I mean, look at, you know, even the Guitar Hero

01:42:47.000 --> 01:42:49.000
platform, you've still got two more games coming out

01:42:49.000 --> 01:42:51.000
this year in Guitar

01:42:51.000 --> 01:42:53.000
well, Band Hero, but come on

01:42:53.000 --> 01:42:55.000
it's Guitar Hero, it's just E10, you know

01:42:55.000 --> 01:42:57.000
and then Van Halen

01:42:57.000 --> 01:42:59.000
you know, that's still coming out too, so

01:42:59.000 --> 01:43:01.000
it's a little

01:43:01.000 --> 01:43:03.000
oversaturation right now

01:43:03.000 --> 01:43:05.000
Hmm, interesting

01:43:05.000 --> 01:43:07.000
comment from xlink in chatroom on a

01:43:07.000 --> 01:43:09.000
related topic, says, I do

01:43:09.000 --> 01:43:11.000
if you look at the box office

01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:13.000
Saw VI got the

01:43:13.000 --> 01:43:15.000
number two spot

01:43:15.000 --> 01:43:17.000
too much can be an overkill, and that's a good

01:43:17.000 --> 01:43:19.000
point is that, you know, maybe the saturation

01:43:19.000 --> 01:43:21.000
of Guitar Hero is starting to catch up to him

01:43:21.000 --> 01:43:23.000
because, you know, I think

01:43:23.000 --> 01:43:25.000
a lot of us, at least me, I never like the

01:43:25.000 --> 01:43:27.000
Saw movies really to begin with, but I especially look at

01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:29.000
Saw VI and go, enough already!

01:43:29.000 --> 01:43:31.000
It was actually pretty good

01:43:31.000 --> 01:43:33.000
Did you go see it? Yeah! Really?

01:43:33.000 --> 01:43:35.000
I didn't like

01:43:35.000 --> 01:43:37.000
the last few because it's just hard to follow what's going on

01:43:37.000 --> 01:43:39.000
but this one actually took place after the last movie

01:43:39.000 --> 01:43:41.000
you know, Chronology, which

01:43:41.000 --> 01:43:43.000
is awesome, and it kind of explained a lot of things

01:43:43.000 --> 01:43:45.000
and I thought it was actually pretty decent

01:43:45.000 --> 01:43:47.000
Hmm, but it got, do you know

01:43:47.000 --> 01:43:49.000
what it got beat by? Did it explain why people like it?

01:43:49.000 --> 01:43:51.000
Where the Wild Things Are, I'm guessing

01:43:51.000 --> 01:43:53.000
No, it got beat by a little indie title

01:43:53.000 --> 01:43:55.000
that has made it big called Paranormal Activity

01:43:55.000 --> 01:43:57.000
I want to see that

01:43:57.000 --> 01:43:59.000
Was the number one movie

01:43:59.000 --> 01:44:01.000
I actually get to see that for free pretty soon

01:44:01.000 --> 01:44:03.000
We're having a screening

01:44:03.000 --> 01:44:05.000
Well that movie's made a lot of

01:44:05.000 --> 01:44:07.000
buzz based off of the internet and Twitter

01:44:07.000 --> 01:44:09.000
and the way, it's the very, it's Blair

01:44:09.000 --> 01:44:11.000
You know, funny enough, we're ten years

01:44:11.000 --> 01:44:13.000
believe it or not, after the Blair Witch Project

01:44:13.000 --> 01:44:15.000
which is a very similar kind of marketing

01:44:15.000 --> 01:44:17.000
although technology's changed in the past ten years

01:44:17.000 --> 01:44:19.000
but Paranormal Activity is sort of

01:44:19.000 --> 01:44:21.000
2009's Blair Witch Project in a way

01:44:21.000 --> 01:44:23.000
They're marketing it like a Wii

01:44:23.000 --> 01:44:25.000
Whereas, you know, we're not gonna put it out everywhere

01:44:25.000 --> 01:44:27.000
and you're gonna hear how awesome this movie is

01:44:27.000 --> 01:44:29.000
and you're gonna be like, I wish I could see it

01:44:29.000 --> 01:44:31.000
but it's not in my town and then we're gonna

01:44:31.000 --> 01:44:33.000
flood the market with it and then

01:44:33.000 --> 01:44:35.000
everyone goes and sees it

01:44:35.000 --> 01:44:37.000
So that's what they did this weekend

01:44:37.000 --> 01:44:39.000
ActDeftInChat says, enough is enough

01:44:39.000 --> 01:44:41.000
I've had it with these motherfucking

01:44:41.000 --> 01:44:43.000
saws in my motherfucking movies

01:44:43.000 --> 01:44:45.000
And that apparently

01:44:45.000 --> 01:44:47.000
might be what some people are saying about Guitar Hero

01:44:47.000 --> 01:44:49.000
I don't know, interestingly enough

01:44:49.000 --> 01:44:51.000
I'm more interested in

01:44:51.000 --> 01:44:53.000
Guitar Hero 5

01:44:53.000 --> 01:44:55.000
than I have been in a Guitar Hero

01:44:55.000 --> 01:44:57.000
game in a while, and I think Band Hero

01:44:57.000 --> 01:44:59.000
was needed, you know what I mean

01:44:59.000 --> 01:45:01.000
For that other audience

01:45:01.000 --> 01:45:03.000
I kind of look at this and go

01:45:03.000 --> 01:45:05.000
Activision

01:45:05.000 --> 01:45:07.000
isn't doing anything wrong this year

01:45:07.000 --> 01:45:09.000
except for the fact that maybe

01:45:09.000 --> 01:45:11.000
they just put out too much

01:45:11.000 --> 01:45:13.000
Really? Here's what comes out

01:45:13.000 --> 01:45:15.000
Here's what comes down too

01:45:15.000 --> 01:45:17.000
I don't think the Van Halen game was needed

01:45:17.000 --> 01:45:19.000
I think in the Metallica game and all this other stuff

01:45:19.000 --> 01:45:21.000
You don't need to buy them

01:45:21.000 --> 01:45:23.000
But Guitar Hero fans do buy them

01:45:23.000 --> 01:45:25.000
And the reason you keep putting them out

01:45:25.000 --> 01:45:27.000
is because you keep buying them

01:45:27.000 --> 01:45:29.000
I guess it's more of a sure thing

01:45:29.000 --> 01:45:31.000
for them to put out a new

01:45:31.000 --> 01:45:33.000
Guitar Hero game every once in a while

01:45:33.000 --> 01:45:35.000
sell it for $60

01:45:35.000 --> 01:45:37.000
and make that

01:45:37.000 --> 01:45:39.000
kind of money back versus trying to

01:45:39.000 --> 01:45:41.000
gamble on download content

01:45:41.000 --> 01:45:43.000
which they do a little bit, but it's nowhere

01:45:43.000 --> 01:45:45.000
near what Rock Band's doing

01:45:45.000 --> 01:45:47.000
Quick question chat and then we'll get into the next story

01:45:47.000 --> 01:45:49.000
XLink asks, speaking of SAW

01:45:49.000 --> 01:45:51.000
basically, how many people have bought

01:45:51.000 --> 01:45:53.000
SAW the video game? Any idea

01:45:53.000 --> 01:45:55.000
Lowkey? How that game's moving?

01:45:55.000 --> 01:45:57.000
The SAW video game?

01:45:57.000 --> 01:45:59.000
I don't know, but I can

01:45:59.000 --> 01:46:01.000
find out

01:46:01.000 --> 01:46:03.000
That brings us to the next story

01:46:03.000 --> 01:46:05.000
If we can move on there and then we'll

01:46:05.000 --> 01:46:07.000
figure that out later

01:46:07.000 --> 01:46:09.000
Well, for people who are playing Marvel Ultimate Alliance 2

01:46:09.000 --> 01:46:11.000
there actually is a future

01:46:11.000 --> 01:46:13.000
character coming up

01:46:13.000 --> 01:46:15.000
for download

01:46:15.000 --> 01:46:17.000
is Cable

01:46:17.000 --> 01:46:19.000
Right now he's an NPC, but he will be

01:46:19.000 --> 01:46:21.000
downloadable to be playable

01:46:21.000 --> 01:46:23.000
I guess that's a pay to unlock type of thing

01:46:23.000 --> 01:46:25.000
and

01:46:25.000 --> 01:46:27.000
yeah, I hope he's

01:46:27.000 --> 01:46:29.000
he's not, you know

01:46:29.000 --> 01:46:31.000
overly imbalanced

01:46:31.000 --> 01:46:33.000
but also

01:46:33.000 --> 01:46:35.000
for more missions, there's a Psylocke mission

01:46:35.000 --> 01:46:37.000
coming out too, which will be pretty cool

01:46:41.000 --> 01:46:43.000
Have you played the Ultimate Alliance game yet?

01:46:43.000 --> 01:46:45.000
The new one?

01:46:45.000 --> 01:46:47.000
No, it's still sitting right here on my desk

01:46:47.000 --> 01:46:49.000
Hopefully one day your hand will be all patched up

01:46:49.000 --> 01:46:51.000
and you can

01:46:51.000 --> 01:46:53.000
get into that, because I'm kind of curious

01:46:53.000 --> 01:46:55.000
what the Marvel fans think of that one

01:46:55.000 --> 01:46:57.000
Couple more stories. Oh, did you find the SAW video game?

01:46:57.000 --> 01:46:59.000
Yes, I did. I'm just pulling up

01:46:59.000 --> 01:47:01.000
PlayStation 3 numbers right now

01:47:01.000 --> 01:47:03.000
For the Xbox 360

01:47:03.000 --> 01:47:05.000
it sold

01:47:05.000 --> 01:47:07.000
.03 million units

01:47:07.000 --> 01:47:09.000
so that would be like

01:47:09.000 --> 01:47:11.000
30,000 copies? Wow

01:47:11.000 --> 01:47:13.000
Yeah

01:47:13.000 --> 01:47:15.000
Yeah, 30,000 copies, granted

01:47:15.000 --> 01:47:17.000
I mean, that's not great

01:47:17.000 --> 01:47:19.000
it only came out a couple weeks ago

01:47:19.000 --> 01:47:21.000
and this is only showing in the first two weeks

01:47:21.000 --> 01:47:23.000
but

01:47:23.000 --> 01:47:25.000
it has dropped in half versus

01:47:25.000 --> 01:47:27.000
week one, week two. Maybe it'll bump up again

01:47:27.000 --> 01:47:29.000
with the new movie out and everything

01:47:29.000 --> 01:47:31.000
Halloween and all that

01:47:31.000 --> 01:47:33.000
Maybe

01:47:33.000 --> 01:47:35.000
PlayStation 3 version sold only

01:47:35.000 --> 01:47:37.000
20,000 units, so 50,000 total

01:47:37.000 --> 01:47:39.000
but once again

01:47:39.000 --> 01:47:41.000
I bring up the point

01:47:41.000 --> 01:47:43.000
these publishers are putting out games that are only selling

01:47:43.000 --> 01:47:45.000
under 100,000 units or whatever

01:47:45.000 --> 01:47:47.000
President Cat

01:47:47.000 --> 01:47:49.000
could do quite well over here

01:47:49.000 --> 01:47:51.000
I mean, if their expectations

01:47:51.000 --> 01:47:53.000
are just to sell maybe a few 100,000

01:47:53.000 --> 01:47:55.000
units, if that, or even

01:47:55.000 --> 01:47:57.000
100,000 units

01:47:57.000 --> 01:47:59.000
it's easy on the Wii

01:47:59.000 --> 01:48:01.000
easy to do that

01:48:01.000 --> 01:48:03.000
Out of curiosity, and I apologize because I know we don't have the answer

01:48:03.000 --> 01:48:05.000
right in front of you, but how does this compare to Silent Hill

01:48:05.000 --> 01:48:07.000
Homecoming? Because I know at one point they were talking

01:48:07.000 --> 01:48:09.000
about Saw was supposed

01:48:09.000 --> 01:48:11.000
to be like Konami's new series

01:48:11.000 --> 01:48:13.000
that I guess

01:48:13.000 --> 01:48:15.000
was going to co-exist with Silent Hill

01:48:15.000 --> 01:48:17.000
but you kind of get the weird feeling, are they going to try and replace

01:48:17.000 --> 01:48:19.000
Silent Hill with Saw? But

01:48:19.000 --> 01:48:21.000
Silent Hill Homecoming kind of took a lot of crap

01:48:21.000 --> 01:48:23.000
from the reviewers

01:48:23.000 --> 01:48:25.000
and the fact

01:48:25.000 --> 01:48:27.000
that they just outright cancelled the game

01:48:27.000 --> 01:48:29.000
for Japan, which kind of says something

01:48:29.000 --> 01:48:31.000
about their faith in the game as it is

01:48:31.000 --> 01:48:33.000
I don't think the game was terrible by any means

01:48:33.000 --> 01:48:35.000
you know, it's different from the other games, you could tell it was developed

01:48:35.000 --> 01:48:37.000
somewhere else, but I don't think it was bad at all

01:48:37.000 --> 01:48:39.000
Well, let's see, in comparison

01:48:39.000 --> 01:48:41.000
for example, the

01:48:41.000 --> 01:48:43.000
Xbox 360 version now

01:48:43.000 --> 01:48:45.000
of Saw only sold 20,000

01:48:45.000 --> 01:48:47.000
units in the first week

01:48:47.000 --> 01:48:49.000
the Xbox 360 version of Silent Hill

01:48:49.000 --> 01:48:51.000
sold 47,000

01:48:51.000 --> 01:48:53.000
units in the first week

01:48:53.000 --> 01:48:55.000
Okay, there you go

01:48:55.000 --> 01:48:57.000
So, you know, about

01:48:57.000 --> 01:48:59.000
almost 30,000 more units

01:48:59.000 --> 01:49:01.000
and then continued to sell

01:49:01.000 --> 01:49:03.000
and still continuing to sell

01:49:03.000 --> 01:49:05.000
but, you know, once again

01:49:05.000 --> 01:49:07.000
it's a little early to see, but

01:49:07.000 --> 01:49:09.000
granted games normally don't peak back

01:49:09.000 --> 01:49:11.000
up again, it's just normally either

01:49:11.000 --> 01:49:13.000
consistent or it starts to

01:49:13.000 --> 01:49:15.000
degrade and it didn't start

01:49:15.000 --> 01:49:17.000
that high to begin with, so it may sell

01:49:17.000 --> 01:49:19.000
I'm guessing probably in its lifetime

01:49:19.000 --> 01:49:21.000
it will probably sell

01:49:21.000 --> 01:49:23.000
maybe 100,000

01:49:23.000 --> 01:49:25.000
units on the Xbox

01:49:25.000 --> 01:49:27.000
360, probably combined

01:49:27.000 --> 01:49:29.000
I'd say it's gonna sell maybe

01:49:29.000 --> 01:49:31.000
150,000, both platforms

01:49:31.000 --> 01:49:33.000
so

01:49:33.000 --> 01:49:35.000
And you don't just pull these numbers out of your ass

01:49:35.000 --> 01:49:37.000
I mean, you do a little bit, but

01:49:37.000 --> 01:49:39.000
keep in mind, for those that may not have listened to the show before

01:49:39.000 --> 01:49:41.000
Loki, you work in distribution, so

01:49:41.000 --> 01:49:43.000
you have a pretty good thumbprint on, you know

01:49:43.000 --> 01:49:45.000
who's ordering what

01:49:45.000 --> 01:49:47.000
I'm still looking at, there's a website, VGCharts

01:49:47.000 --> 01:49:49.000
that pulls stuff from NPD

01:49:49.000 --> 01:49:51.000
numbers, so I'm looking at what the actual

01:49:51.000 --> 01:49:53.000
numbers were each week

01:49:53.000 --> 01:49:55.000
Silent Hill on PS3 sold

01:49:55.000 --> 01:49:57.000
41,000 units in the first week

01:49:57.000 --> 01:49:59.000
versus the 20 that sold

01:49:59.000 --> 01:50:01.000
you know

01:50:01.000 --> 01:50:03.000
not even 20, you know

01:50:03.000 --> 01:50:05.000
probably like 15

01:50:05.000 --> 01:50:07.000
for Saw, so

01:50:07.000 --> 01:50:09.000
Complete random ass question I'm gonna put out there

01:50:09.000 --> 01:50:11.000
and maybe you don't even know the answer to this, but

01:50:11.000 --> 01:50:13.000
is there any highly anticipated

01:50:13.000 --> 01:50:15.000
game coming out this season

01:50:15.000 --> 01:50:17.000
that you're just noticing is not

01:50:17.000 --> 01:50:19.000
selling? That you're just not selling

01:50:19.000 --> 01:50:21.000
copies of it? I'm not selling copies

01:50:21.000 --> 01:50:23.000
of it

01:50:23.000 --> 01:50:25.000
I was surprised

01:50:25.000 --> 01:50:27.000
that people aren't jumping on

01:50:27.000 --> 01:50:29.000
DJ Hero as much as I thought they would

01:50:29.000 --> 01:50:31.000
but I can understand that because it's

01:50:31.000 --> 01:50:33.000
120 dollars

01:50:33.000 --> 01:50:35.000
Tony Hawk's Bride, not doing well

01:50:35.000 --> 01:50:37.000
you know, once

01:50:37.000 --> 01:50:39.000
again, because it's 120 dollars

01:50:39.000 --> 01:50:41.000
and it's a Tony Hawk game, I'd say like

01:50:41.000 --> 01:50:43.000
standard priced game that's not doing well

01:50:47.000 --> 01:50:49.000
I'm putting you on the spot a little bit, I'm sorry

01:50:49.000 --> 01:50:51.000
Rabbids Go Home isn't doing very well

01:50:51.000 --> 01:50:53.000
not a lot of people are picking that up in large

01:50:53.000 --> 01:50:55.000
quantities like the other Rabbids games

01:50:55.000 --> 01:50:57.000
they're kind of getting a warning

01:50:57.000 --> 01:50:59.000
I guess they're

01:50:59.000 --> 01:51:01.000
they've worn out their welcome

01:51:01.000 --> 01:51:03.000
I would say maybe

01:51:07.000 --> 01:51:09.000
oh man

01:51:09.000 --> 01:51:11.000
I had to beg and plead for

01:51:11.000 --> 01:51:13.000
Demon Souls

01:51:13.000 --> 01:51:15.000
and then everybody after the fact was scrambling

01:51:15.000 --> 01:51:17.000
for that, I'm like dude I told you

01:51:17.000 --> 01:51:19.000
you should have listened to me

01:51:19.000 --> 01:51:21.000
so is that game actually moving now?

01:51:21.000 --> 01:51:23.000
oh yeah it's moving, they're sold out at Atlas

01:51:23.000 --> 01:51:25.000
I mean they keep selling out

01:51:25.000 --> 01:51:27.000
so it's doing

01:51:27.000 --> 01:51:29.000
it's probably the fastest moving

01:51:29.000 --> 01:51:31.000
Atlas title I've seen

01:51:31.000 --> 01:51:33.000
some of the smaller niche titles

01:51:33.000 --> 01:51:35.000
even like Muramasa don't do

01:51:35.000 --> 01:51:37.000
as well right off the bat

01:51:37.000 --> 01:51:39.000
they hear all the buzz and it's like

01:51:39.000 --> 01:51:41.000
there's people coming in asking for this, I need this right away

01:51:41.000 --> 01:51:43.000
so it's not a surprise

01:51:43.000 --> 01:51:45.000
but

01:51:45.000 --> 01:51:47.000
I'd say probably this fall

01:51:47.000 --> 01:51:49.000
the one title that's not going to do as well

01:51:49.000 --> 01:51:51.000
as the company's hoping

01:51:51.000 --> 01:51:53.000
I'm guessing would be Avatar

01:51:53.000 --> 01:51:55.000
I don't think that's going to do that well

01:51:55.000 --> 01:51:57.000
oh the one based on the movie?

01:51:57.000 --> 01:51:59.000
I think that movie's going to bomb

01:51:59.000 --> 01:52:01.000
I think that movie's going to be a big fucking bomb

01:52:01.000 --> 01:52:03.000
I'm not knocking it, it actually looks

01:52:03.000 --> 01:52:05.000
kind of neat, but I just think it's going to be

01:52:05.000 --> 01:52:07.000
one of those movies that is

01:52:07.000 --> 01:52:09.000
especially considering the hype is too high

01:52:09.000 --> 01:52:11.000
I think that movie's going to bomb

01:52:11.000 --> 01:52:13.000
of course watch me be wrong

01:52:13.000 --> 01:52:15.000
who knows

01:52:15.000 --> 01:52:17.000
well this is something that may not sell a lot

01:52:17.000 --> 01:52:19.000
but I think this looks freaking phenomenal

01:52:19.000 --> 01:52:21.000
do you guys know what a Microsoft

01:52:21.000 --> 01:52:23.000
I know one, and this is really sad

01:52:23.000 --> 01:52:25.000
Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles

01:52:25.000 --> 01:52:27.000
The Crystal Bearers, that's a tough sell

01:52:27.000 --> 01:52:29.000
no one wants to buy it because the last one was a port

01:52:29.000 --> 01:52:31.000
of a DS title and everybody hated it

01:52:31.000 --> 01:52:33.000
and so they're like oh Crystal Chronicles

01:52:33.000 --> 01:52:35.000
I'm not bringing that shit in

01:52:35.000 --> 01:52:37.000
well I want to show you guys

01:52:37.000 --> 01:52:39.000
a little bit of this, how many of you guys know what a Microsoft

01:52:39.000 --> 01:52:41.000
Surface is?

01:52:41.000 --> 01:52:43.000
aren't those like the giant

01:52:43.000 --> 01:52:45.000
tables, like we saw one at Penny Arcade

01:52:45.000 --> 01:52:47.000
yeah we played with the Google Maps on there

01:52:47.000 --> 01:52:49.000
yeah, us and Bobby were kind of like

01:52:49.000 --> 01:52:51.000
we were giving each other tours of our neighborhoods

01:52:51.000 --> 01:52:53.000
on the Microsoft Surface on the Google Maps

01:52:53.000 --> 01:52:55.000
I took you guys to Alabama, that's right

01:52:55.000 --> 01:52:57.000
the Surface tables are a lot of fun, it's like a gigantic

01:52:57.000 --> 01:52:59.000
iPhone, which is probably

01:52:59.000 --> 01:53:01.000
not what Microsoft would want me to call it

01:53:01.000 --> 01:53:03.000
I don't know what it is, well I gotta say

01:53:03.000 --> 01:53:05.000
this looks rad

01:53:05.000 --> 01:53:07.000
this is a little game called Surfacecapes

01:53:07.000 --> 01:53:09.000
and they're calling it a proof of concept

01:53:09.000 --> 01:53:11.000
project, it is using

01:53:11.000 --> 01:53:13.000
the Microsoft Surface table to play

01:53:13.000 --> 01:53:15.000
Dungeons and Dragons essentially

01:53:15.000 --> 01:53:17.000
it's using the Surface table

01:53:17.000 --> 01:53:19.000
get this, you can actually plot out little pieces

01:53:19.000 --> 01:53:21.000
on the map, and they actually show you

01:53:21.000 --> 01:53:23.000
a little tour of this, you can put pieces on the grid

01:53:23.000 --> 01:53:25.000
so you can actually, you know how like people get out

01:53:25.000 --> 01:53:27.000
their big charts and their pen and paper

01:53:27.000 --> 01:53:29.000
to move characters around, imagine

01:53:29.000 --> 01:53:31.000
being able to do all that on the Surface, and look at that

01:53:31.000 --> 01:53:33.000
D20 flying in that you can actually roll there

01:53:33.000 --> 01:53:35.000
virtually, and you can't cheat

01:53:35.000 --> 01:53:37.000
you can do that virtually

01:53:37.000 --> 01:53:39.000
there on the Microsoft Surface, and you can actually

01:53:39.000 --> 01:53:41.000
move these little pieces around

01:53:41.000 --> 01:53:43.000
now this is going to make the nerds

01:53:43.000 --> 01:53:45.000
want to have one of these in their home, I think this is

01:53:45.000 --> 01:53:47.000
pretty cool, having this, this is

01:53:47.000 --> 01:53:49.000
just a proof of concept for right now

01:53:49.000 --> 01:53:51.000
but I think a lot of people have looked at these

01:53:51.000 --> 01:53:53.000
Surfaces going, what do you do with it?

01:53:53.000 --> 01:53:55.000
like there's not a lot

01:53:55.000 --> 01:53:57.000
to do here, but this is

01:53:57.000 --> 01:53:59.000
really expensive too

01:53:59.000 --> 01:54:01.000
oh I'm sure, I mean I've never seen one

01:54:01.000 --> 01:54:03.000
outside of that one hotel, and it seems

01:54:03.000 --> 01:54:05.000
like that's where you're going to see them, is like in

01:54:05.000 --> 01:54:07.000
the lobbies of hotels for people

01:54:07.000 --> 01:54:09.000
to find like coffee shops and

01:54:09.000 --> 01:54:11.000
expensive restaurants they want to

01:54:11.000 --> 01:54:13.000
go to and so forth

01:54:13.000 --> 01:54:15.000
Salaciouspopnchat says some casinos in Vegas are starting

01:54:15.000 --> 01:54:17.000
to use it, yeah I can see that too

01:54:17.000 --> 01:54:19.000
Redertainment says Microsoft Surface is a

01:54:19.000 --> 01:54:21.000
cool thing to play around with, it's

01:54:21.000 --> 01:54:23.000
like watching TV while high without

01:54:23.000 --> 01:54:25.000
actually being high

01:54:25.000 --> 01:54:27.000
it certainly is

01:54:27.000 --> 01:54:29.000
something a little different, it's

01:54:29.000 --> 01:54:31.000
a cool little device, I think it just might be a little ahead of

01:54:31.000 --> 01:54:33.000
its time, like it's not the kind of thing people are going to have

01:54:33.000 --> 01:54:35.000
in their homes, you're not going to be replacing your

01:54:35.000 --> 01:54:37.000
coffee table with the Surface at any time soon

01:54:37.000 --> 01:54:39.000
I will, but then again I don't have a coffee table

01:54:39.000 --> 01:54:41.000
yeah don't, don't spill a drink

01:54:41.000 --> 01:54:43.000
on it though or you're fucked, I mean that's the

01:54:43.000 --> 01:54:45.000
other nervous thing about it, of course

01:54:45.000 --> 01:54:47.000
then again, I've dropped my iPhone I don't know

01:54:47.000 --> 01:54:49.000
how many times and it still works, but I also put a

01:54:49.000 --> 01:54:51.000
protective case on it, so

01:54:51.000 --> 01:54:53.000
I've dropped mine on concrete

01:54:53.000 --> 01:54:55.000
and it hasn't broken, and I don't have a case

01:54:55.000 --> 01:54:57.000
on mine, wow

01:54:57.000 --> 01:54:59.000
see I have a big thick case on mine

01:54:59.000 --> 01:55:01.000
because when I got my iPhone I said, okay

01:55:01.000 --> 01:55:03.000
I know this guy is going to get dropped

01:55:03.000 --> 01:55:05.000
so I need to figure out a case I can put

01:55:05.000 --> 01:55:07.000
on it, wow you don't even have a protective screen on it

01:55:07.000 --> 01:55:09.000
do you, that's pretty amazing

01:55:09.000 --> 01:55:11.000
nope, wow, look at the back of it

01:55:11.000 --> 01:55:13.000
that's not bad at all, but then again

01:55:13.000 --> 01:55:15.000
here's the silver, I didn't even know they made them

01:55:15.000 --> 01:55:17.000
the original ones, I have an old school

01:55:17.000 --> 01:55:19.000
iPhone, interesting

01:55:19.000 --> 01:55:21.000
which I'm going to auction off when I get

01:55:21.000 --> 01:55:23.000
my 3GS for a holiday

01:55:23.000 --> 01:55:25.000
I think those things are pretty waterproof

01:55:25.000 --> 01:55:27.000
because it looks like, you know, they have a picture

01:55:27.000 --> 01:55:29.000
like a fancy picture, it looks like someone

01:55:29.000 --> 01:55:31.000
in a casino, they have their

01:55:31.000 --> 01:55:33.000
drinks set on it, I think that because

01:55:33.000 --> 01:55:35.000
the monitor is actually so inside of it

01:55:35.000 --> 01:55:37.000
you know, and the table

01:55:37.000 --> 01:55:39.000
goes way beyond the actual monitor

01:55:39.000 --> 01:55:41.000
if you spilled something on it it would just drip over the edge

01:55:41.000 --> 01:55:43.000
one more comment from Redertainment

01:55:43.000 --> 01:55:45.000
NBC News used Surface during their

01:55:45.000 --> 01:55:47.000
2008 election coverage, yeah

01:55:47.000 --> 01:55:49.000
and also that probably has a lot

01:55:49.000 --> 01:55:51.000
to do with Microsoft and NBC

01:55:51.000 --> 01:55:53.000
collaborating on a lot of stuff, I mean

01:55:53.000 --> 01:55:55.000
MSNBC, hello, but then, you know

01:55:55.000 --> 01:55:57.000
I like

01:55:57.000 --> 01:55:59.000
watching election year coverage because that's

01:55:59.000 --> 01:56:01.000
when all the channels try to roll out their new technology

01:56:01.000 --> 01:56:03.000
to get you to watch them, remember when CNN

01:56:03.000 --> 01:56:05.000
did the holograms

01:56:05.000 --> 01:56:07.000
like the most pointless thing ever

01:56:07.000 --> 01:56:09.000
it was just like a cool technology to show

01:56:09.000 --> 01:56:11.000
off, so

01:56:11.000 --> 01:56:13.000
Amanda giving us a warning in chat

01:56:13.000 --> 01:56:15.000
I dropped my iPhone the other night

01:56:15.000 --> 01:56:17.000
and totally cracked the screen

01:56:17.000 --> 01:56:19.000
I don't know how many times I dropped it

01:56:19.000 --> 01:56:21.000
before and it had been fine, Dan did

01:56:21.000 --> 01:56:23.000
his first time, he got his, he cracked it in his

01:56:23.000 --> 01:56:25.000
pocket, so careful, careful folks

01:56:25.000 --> 01:56:27.000
yeah, I don't think I'll be buying one of these

01:56:27.000 --> 01:56:29.000
they're $12,000

01:56:29.000 --> 01:56:31.000
or $12,500

01:56:31.000 --> 01:56:33.000
but you know

01:56:33.000 --> 01:56:35.000
like in five years

01:56:35.000 --> 01:56:37.000
that price, remember when HDTVs

01:56:37.000 --> 01:56:39.000
were $8,000, I'm sorry, it's still way too damn

01:56:39.000 --> 01:56:41.000
expensive, you get an HDTV, put a

01:56:41.000 --> 01:56:43.000
nice touchscreen interface on it

01:56:43.000 --> 01:56:45.000
Surface, done, I mean you don't really

01:56:45.000 --> 01:56:47.000
I don't understand why this stuff's so expensive

01:56:47.000 --> 01:56:49.000
it's not $12,000 unit

01:56:49.000 --> 01:56:51.000
I mean, come on

01:56:51.000 --> 01:56:53.000
Salacious Pop was just asking as we were talking about it on air

01:56:53.000 --> 01:56:55.000
cause there's a little delay, LOL, what channel did

01:56:55.000 --> 01:56:57.000
the Princess Leia shit

01:56:57.000 --> 01:56:59.000
that's a great way to describe what CNN did that year

01:56:59.000 --> 01:57:01.000
and Redertainment follows up with

01:57:01.000 --> 01:57:03.000
Wolf Blitzer

01:57:03.000 --> 01:57:05.000
I am your father

01:57:05.000 --> 01:57:07.000
love it, so wrong, funny, funny, funny

01:57:07.000 --> 01:57:09.000
I don't know if you happened to catch the soup

01:57:09.000 --> 01:57:11.000
this week, they had a thing, no, I stopped

01:57:11.000 --> 01:57:13.000
watching that show, not that, I love Joel McHale

01:57:13.000 --> 01:57:15.000
I just always forget to TV

01:57:15.000 --> 01:57:17.000
they had a funny quote, it was a show

01:57:17.000 --> 01:57:19.000
about celebrities that saw ghosts

01:57:19.000 --> 01:57:21.000
or something, but she was talking about

01:57:21.000 --> 01:57:23.000
her friend or something that

01:57:23.000 --> 01:57:25.000
he's a gay Republican who's a

01:57:25.000 --> 01:57:27.000
drug addict or something like that, but the way she said it

01:57:27.000 --> 01:57:29.000
was hilarious, sounds like my ex

01:57:29.000 --> 01:57:31.000
oh, snap, alright, snap

01:57:31.000 --> 01:57:33.000
alright, I was just thinking it only

01:57:33.000 --> 01:57:35.000
I had the tact to not say it aloud, awe

01:57:35.000 --> 01:57:37.000
let's see

01:57:37.000 --> 01:57:39.000
really random topic, and then we're gonna get it into

01:57:39.000 --> 01:57:41.000
the mailbag, your email's at

01:57:41.000 --> 01:57:43.000
orangelessradio.com, DarkSakura will read here in a moment

01:57:43.000 --> 01:57:45.000
but I'm gonna throw out this completely random

01:57:45.000 --> 01:57:47.000
question from chat, it's like

01:57:47.000 --> 01:57:49.000
throw random questions at Loki night, I swear

01:57:49.000 --> 01:57:51.000
Deekman is asking, Loki

01:57:51.000 --> 01:57:53.000
did you see this announcement that a custom

01:57:53.000 --> 01:57:55.000
firmware for the PSP 3000 is supposed to be

01:57:55.000 --> 01:57:57.000
released next week

01:57:57.000 --> 01:57:59.000
that's like every week, I mean

01:57:59.000 --> 01:58:01.000
I'm sorry, like, which custom

01:58:01.000 --> 01:58:03.000
firmware, who's making it, what

01:58:03.000 --> 01:58:05.000
is it, I haven't even bothered to look

01:58:05.000 --> 01:58:07.000
just because I'm so sick

01:58:07.000 --> 01:58:09.000
and tired of, like, I got to the

01:58:09.000 --> 01:58:11.000
point where you can convert

01:58:11.000 --> 01:58:13.000
some games to run with certain other

01:58:13.000 --> 01:58:15.000
firmwares and stuff

01:58:15.000 --> 01:58:17.000
alright, I'm gonna

01:58:17.000 --> 01:58:19.000
go look at this

01:58:19.000 --> 01:58:21.000
alright, you look it up, in the mean time

01:58:21.000 --> 01:58:23.000
DarkSakura's gonna dive into the mailbag

01:58:23.000 --> 01:58:25.000
mailbag at orangelessradio.com

01:58:25.000 --> 01:58:27.000
and read your emails

01:58:27.000 --> 01:58:29.000
cause, dang it, you send us emails

01:58:29.000 --> 01:58:31.000
and show us a little love, so we show you

01:58:31.000 --> 01:58:33.000
some love back in a little segment we call the mailbag

01:58:33.000 --> 01:58:35.000
alright, um

01:58:35.000 --> 01:58:37.000
hi LLR, thanks for reading my

01:58:37.000 --> 01:58:39.000
twitter question that's upon playing

01:58:39.000 --> 01:58:41.000
on the short show about the

01:58:41.000 --> 01:58:43.000
official Konami DDR tournament

01:58:43.000 --> 01:58:45.000
following up on it, I was wondering what you guys

01:58:45.000 --> 01:58:47.000
thought about the age restrictions on Konami's

01:58:47.000 --> 01:58:49.000
official DDR tournament, I have enclosed a snippet

01:58:49.000 --> 01:58:51.000
about it on the official summary

01:58:51.000 --> 01:58:53.000
all registrants must be between the ages of 13

01:58:53.000 --> 01:58:55.000
and 32 years as of

01:58:55.000 --> 01:58:57.000
April 1, 2009

01:58:57.000 --> 01:58:59.000
according to these rules, I actually would be

01:58:59.000 --> 01:59:01.000
ineligible to compete next year if there was another

01:59:01.000 --> 01:59:03.000
tournament, I'm not sure what

01:59:03.000 --> 01:59:05.000
to think, maybe they

01:59:05.000 --> 01:59:07.000
are thinking someone hits 32 they fall apart

01:59:07.000 --> 01:59:09.000
anyway, give it the good work

01:59:09.000 --> 01:59:11.000
peace out and triple A

01:59:11.000 --> 01:59:13.000
that's from uh

01:59:13.000 --> 01:59:15.000
Jammer J

01:59:15.000 --> 01:59:17.000
I think that's stupid

01:59:17.000 --> 01:59:19.000
it's incredibly stupid and kind of

01:59:19.000 --> 01:59:21.000
insulting, especially to the fanbase that kind of

01:59:21.000 --> 01:59:23.000
helped DDR get big, but this is

01:59:23.000 --> 01:59:25.000
exactly why I had no idea

01:59:25.000 --> 01:59:27.000
about this until you mentioned it, because guess what

01:59:27.000 --> 01:59:29.000
I stopped following it, so maybe that's why

01:59:29.000 --> 01:59:31.000
I'm not allowed to participate

01:59:31.000 --> 01:59:33.000
next year I will be able to participate

01:59:33.000 --> 01:59:35.000
I was 32 April 1, 2009

01:59:35.000 --> 01:59:37.000
I know, I know

01:59:37.000 --> 01:59:39.000
it's ridiculous

01:59:39.000 --> 01:59:41.000
I mean, it

01:59:41.000 --> 01:59:43.000
whatever, if you want to

01:59:43.000 --> 01:59:45.000
alienate some of your potential fans

01:59:45.000 --> 01:59:47.000
that way, go for it, whatever

01:59:49.000 --> 01:59:51.000
ugh, I need a new nose, Rob

01:59:51.000 --> 01:59:53.000
I'm kind of, it's weird

01:59:53.000 --> 01:59:55.000
I am and I'm not over the DDR

01:59:55.000 --> 01:59:57.000
thing, like some days I go

01:59:57.000 --> 01:59:59.000
I'm so done with DDR, like it's just

01:59:59.000 --> 02:00:01.000
not cool anymore, but then I go

02:00:01.000 --> 02:00:03.000
I kind of want that new one on the 360 PS3

02:00:03.000 --> 02:00:05.000
it looks kind of awesome, my sheet metal

02:00:05.000 --> 02:00:07.000
came in the other day

02:00:07.000 --> 02:00:09.000
you know what that's for, right?

02:00:09.000 --> 02:00:11.000
I know, for your little DDR project

02:00:11.000 --> 02:00:13.000
and, but you're still in your 20s

02:00:13.000 --> 02:00:15.000
so whatever, oh whatever

02:00:15.000 --> 02:00:17.000
I mean, barely, oh god

02:00:17.000 --> 02:00:19.000
you young whippersnapper

02:00:19.000 --> 02:00:21.000
in your DDR mat

02:00:21.000 --> 02:00:23.000
listen, okay, I went

02:00:23.000 --> 02:00:25.000
so far as getting official

02:00:25.000 --> 02:00:27.000
Konami

02:00:27.000 --> 02:00:29.000
stickers from the arcade machine that are gonna

02:00:29.000 --> 02:00:31.000
go on this thing, I mean that's how

02:00:31.000 --> 02:00:33.000
awesome it's gonna look

02:00:33.000 --> 02:00:35.000
well how do you feel that in, you know, 4 years or whatever

02:00:35.000 --> 02:00:37.000
you're dead to Konami

02:00:37.000 --> 02:00:39.000
Dead Man Walking, Dead Man Dancing

02:00:39.000 --> 02:00:41.000
I don't buy their games

02:00:41.000 --> 02:00:43.000
oh, maybe that should be the next game that comes out

02:00:43.000 --> 02:00:45.000
it's like Zombies Ate My Neighbors combined with DDR, Dead Man Dancing

02:00:45.000 --> 02:00:47.000
dude, I have a way to fix their whole franchise

02:00:47.000 --> 02:00:49.000
but no, let's add 8 arrows

02:00:49.000 --> 02:00:51.000
to it, that'll be awesome

02:00:51.000 --> 02:00:53.000
oh, well, are we actually gonna do step charts

02:00:53.000 --> 02:00:55.000
that support those 8 arrows?

02:00:55.000 --> 02:00:57.000
no, we're just gonna use some programs

02:00:57.000 --> 02:00:59.000
to integrate these arrows for you

02:00:59.000 --> 02:01:01.000
that's awesome, because that works so well with quads

02:01:03.000 --> 02:01:05.000
yeah, over DDR, sorry

02:01:05.000 --> 02:01:07.000
which is just a scam to get you to buy

02:01:07.000 --> 02:01:09.000
you know, more dance mats

02:01:09.000 --> 02:01:11.000
I know we have a lot of listeners

02:01:11.000 --> 02:01:13.000
that are still attached to the music games

02:01:13.000 --> 02:01:15.000
and yes, we founded the station on it

02:01:15.000 --> 02:01:17.000
but I guess, you know, now that some of us are

02:01:17.000 --> 02:01:19.000
getting that 32 threshold, I guess we are officially

02:01:19.000 --> 02:01:21.000
too old for DDR

02:01:21.000 --> 02:01:23.000
well, here's the other thing too, I mean, look at their game releases

02:01:23.000 --> 02:01:25.000
for DDR, they're not doing

02:01:25.000 --> 02:01:27.000
game only releases

02:01:27.000 --> 02:01:29.000
not until like, way later on

02:01:29.000 --> 02:01:31.000
so if you wanna really stick with DDR

02:01:31.000 --> 02:01:33.000
and buy a new release each year, guess what

02:01:33.000 --> 02:01:35.000
you're gonna get a soft mat to go with that release

02:01:35.000 --> 02:01:37.000
and it's gonna be $10 more than they would normally be

02:01:37.000 --> 02:01:39.000
by itself

02:01:39.000 --> 02:01:41.000
however, I will say this

02:01:41.000 --> 02:01:43.000
if Beatmania 2DX or whatever goes to PlayStation 3

02:01:43.000 --> 02:01:45.000
I'm very interested in what's next

02:01:45.000 --> 02:01:47.000
for that franchise, because I've always loved Beatmania

02:01:47.000 --> 02:01:49.000
well, if it goes to the PlayStation 3, you can import that shit

02:01:49.000 --> 02:01:51.000
ooh, I didn't even think of that

02:01:51.000 --> 02:01:53.000
good point, my man, good point

02:01:53.000 --> 02:01:55.000
anyhow

02:01:55.000 --> 02:01:57.000
more emails, sorry

02:01:57.000 --> 02:01:59.000
sorry, I'm kind of feeling like crap right now

02:01:59.000 --> 02:02:07.000
this one is a Kingdom Hearts 358 two day mini review

02:02:07.000 --> 02:02:11.000
it's like, well I'm saying this because you guys probably aren't gonna play the game

02:02:11.000 --> 02:02:15.000
so I thought that writing a review would help motivate you guys to buy it or at least rent it

02:02:15.000 --> 02:02:17.000
I beat it in a week, dude, please use punctuation

02:02:17.000 --> 02:02:19.000
and capitalize your thing, cause

02:02:19.000 --> 02:02:21.000
I saw a commercial for the game on TV today

02:02:21.000 --> 02:02:23.000
just random thought

02:02:23.000 --> 02:02:25.000
I never made it through the first game

02:02:25.000 --> 02:02:27.000
or played the second game

02:02:27.000 --> 02:02:29.000
or played the DS game

02:02:29.000 --> 02:02:31.000
I glitched my second game

02:02:31.000 --> 02:02:33.000
or played the PlayStation 2 port of the Gameboy Advance game

02:02:33.000 --> 02:02:35.000
so I'm so lost in it right now

02:02:35.000 --> 02:02:39.000
that I just am not gonna even bother

02:02:39.000 --> 02:02:41.000
I'm gonna sum this up

02:02:41.000 --> 02:02:43.000
you play as Roxas

02:02:43.000 --> 02:02:45.000
and he gives it an 8

02:02:45.000 --> 02:02:47.000
so like, I don't even know who Roxas is

02:02:47.000 --> 02:02:49.000
I mean, I know who he is

02:02:49.000 --> 02:02:51.000
but this character means nothing to me

02:02:51.000 --> 02:02:53.000
re-write your review with proper grammar

02:02:53.000 --> 02:02:55.000
and spelling and everything

02:02:55.000 --> 02:02:57.000
and I'll put it up on the site

02:02:57.000 --> 02:02:59.000
I do love the Kingdom Hearts games

02:02:59.000 --> 02:03:01.000
but I'm just not interested in these handheld ones

02:03:01.000 --> 02:03:03.000
and this all goes back to my whole

02:03:03.000 --> 02:03:05.000
I'm just not as big of a fan of handheld games

02:03:05.000 --> 02:03:07.000
as I am playing them on my big TV

02:03:07.000 --> 02:03:09.000
so I'll wait until the next

02:03:09.000 --> 02:03:11.000
big official Kingdom Hearts 3

02:03:11.000 --> 02:03:13.000
comes out and leave all these side stories

02:03:13.000 --> 02:03:15.000
on the side

02:03:15.000 --> 02:03:17.000
alright, this one comes from

02:03:17.000 --> 02:03:19.000
AZHP

02:03:47.000 --> 02:03:49.000
gross

02:04:03.000 --> 02:04:07.000
most of those stores are franchised anyway

02:04:07.000 --> 02:04:09.000
so

02:04:09.000 --> 02:04:11.000
well, they closed one not far from here

02:04:11.000 --> 02:04:13.000
the one that was in the Target lot closed

02:04:13.000 --> 02:04:15.000
yeah, but I don't work over there

02:04:15.000 --> 02:04:17.000
but, you know

02:04:17.000 --> 02:04:19.000
they're not all doing great

02:04:19.000 --> 02:04:21.000
mmmkay

02:04:21.000 --> 02:04:23.000
ooh, we got an angry letter

02:04:23.000 --> 02:04:25.000
angry letter

02:04:25.000 --> 02:04:27.000
I love angry emails, yay

02:04:27.000 --> 02:04:29.000
and thankfully I sound like crap now

02:04:29.000 --> 02:04:31.000
dear OLR

02:04:31.000 --> 02:04:33.000
I listened to the podcast of the October 18th show

02:04:33.000 --> 02:04:35.000
and was honestly astounded at what I heard

02:04:35.000 --> 02:04:37.000
upon reflection, what did I expect to come out of the mouths of people

02:04:37.000 --> 02:04:39.000
who live in the liberal enclave

02:04:39.000 --> 02:04:41.000
that is California

02:04:41.000 --> 02:04:43.000
how can you stand behind the possible presidency

02:04:43.000 --> 02:04:45.000
of Cat?

02:04:45.000 --> 02:04:47.000
Cat has little foreign animal experience

02:04:47.000 --> 02:04:49.000
and no executive experience

02:04:49.000 --> 02:04:51.000
and likes the coherent strategy to deal with the growing threat

02:04:51.000 --> 02:04:53.000
presented by radical fundamental fleas

02:04:53.000 --> 02:04:55.000
I even doubt that Cat

02:04:55.000 --> 02:04:57.000
is even from this country

02:04:57.000 --> 02:04:59.000
I heard that Cat is a Persian

02:04:59.000 --> 02:05:01.000
any rational person knows that the true

02:05:01.000 --> 02:05:03.000
and correct choice for president is Dog

02:05:03.000 --> 02:05:05.000
Dog has expressed his bath-based

02:05:05.000 --> 02:05:07.000
strategy for dealing with threat of fleas

02:05:07.000 --> 02:05:09.000
once and for all

02:05:09.000 --> 02:05:11.000
Dog has a steady paw and is loyal to our

02:05:11.000 --> 02:05:13.000
president, President Burrow

02:05:13.000 --> 02:05:15.000
yes, Dog has

02:05:15.000 --> 02:05:17.000
chased cars in the past, but after accepting

02:05:17.000 --> 02:05:19.000
Jesus as his lord and master

02:05:19.000 --> 02:05:21.000
I can assure you that Dog will never chase cars again

02:05:21.000 --> 02:05:23.000
when you step into the gaming

02:05:23.000 --> 02:05:25.000
arena on Tuesday, remember who is

02:05:25.000 --> 02:05:27.000
stuck by you like a loyal friend who treats you

02:05:27.000 --> 02:05:29.000
like you are its pet

02:05:29.000 --> 02:05:31.000
and not the dominant person you are

02:05:31.000 --> 02:05:33.000
vote for Dog for president

02:05:33.000 --> 02:05:35.000
do it or the fleas win

02:05:35.000 --> 02:05:37.000
thanks for letting me listen from the conservative Eden that is Utah

02:05:37.000 --> 02:05:39.000
Reddertainment

02:05:39.000 --> 02:05:41.000
Dog has been brought to you by Glenn Beck

02:05:41.000 --> 02:05:43.000
a smart, rational, and insane voice for the future

02:05:43.000 --> 02:05:45.000
if that isn't proof that I'm clearly kidding

02:05:45.000 --> 02:05:47.000
what else can I say?

02:05:47.000 --> 02:05:49.000
Well, I'd have to say that Dog has been

02:05:49.000 --> 02:05:51.000
known to eat poop

02:05:51.000 --> 02:05:53.000
and honestly, Dog thinks

02:05:53.000 --> 02:05:55.000
I threw something when I just faked them out

02:05:55.000 --> 02:05:57.000
so I don't really know if I can trust

02:05:57.000 --> 02:05:59.000
Dog to

02:05:59.000 --> 02:06:01.000
you know, not drool

02:06:01.000 --> 02:06:03.000
on the issues

02:06:03.000 --> 02:06:05.000
I can rely on Cat to be self-sufficient

02:06:05.000 --> 02:06:07.000
except for Shermy, who is just fat and lean

02:06:07.000 --> 02:06:09.000
Cat has eaten hair

02:06:09.000 --> 02:06:11.000
so, you know, that's not as bad as poop

02:06:11.000 --> 02:06:13.000
but still, both candidates have their flaws

02:06:13.000 --> 02:06:15.000
Reddertainment, you ignorant slut

02:06:15.000 --> 02:06:17.000
no, I'm just kidding

02:06:17.000 --> 02:06:19.000
actually, that was like the email of the century

02:06:19.000 --> 02:06:21.000
loved it

02:06:21.000 --> 02:06:23.000
Gold Star for you, sir

02:06:23.000 --> 02:06:25.000
I think that is worthy of the Gold Star

02:06:25.000 --> 02:06:27.000
email bag segment recipient

02:06:27.000 --> 02:06:29.000
wouldn't you agree, DarkSakura?

02:06:29.000 --> 02:06:31.000
Was proper grammar and punctuation all that used?

02:06:31.000 --> 02:06:33.000
So there you go, Gold Star recipient

02:06:33.000 --> 02:06:35.000
applause to you

02:06:35.000 --> 02:06:37.000
I closed the fanfare

02:06:37.000 --> 02:06:39.000
There's your fanfare

02:06:41.000 --> 02:06:43.000
Well done there, Rob

02:06:43.000 --> 02:06:45.000
Thank you

02:06:45.000 --> 02:06:47.000
Does my fanfare get a Gold Star?

02:06:47.000 --> 02:06:49.000
Your fanfare gets a

02:06:49.000 --> 02:06:51.000
My god, you're like

02:06:51.000 --> 02:06:53.000
really sick over there, aren't you?

02:06:53.000 --> 02:06:55.000
It's the dust in the room

02:06:55.000 --> 02:06:57.000
What's the dust in the room?

02:06:57.000 --> 02:06:59.000
No, I opened up my old

02:06:59.000 --> 02:07:01.000
laptop case to try to find my SD card

02:07:01.000 --> 02:07:03.000
reader and it kicked up

02:07:03.000 --> 02:07:05.000
a crap ton of dust

02:07:05.000 --> 02:07:07.000
So, yeah

02:07:07.000 --> 02:07:09.000
All we are is dust in the room

02:07:09.000 --> 02:07:11.000
That's the official campaign

02:07:11.000 --> 02:07:13.000
song, by the way, of President Cat

02:07:13.000 --> 02:07:15.000
Not really

02:07:15.000 --> 02:07:17.000
Is that it for emails tonight?

02:07:17.000 --> 02:07:19.000
Mailbag at Orange Lounge Radio

02:07:19.000 --> 02:07:21.000
That's all I'm fucking reading

02:07:21.000 --> 02:07:23.000
Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com

02:07:23.000 --> 02:07:25.000
if you want to send your email

02:07:25.000 --> 02:07:27.000
for possible reading

02:07:27.000 --> 02:07:29.000
on the air next week

02:07:29.000 --> 02:07:31.000
How much of that is getting picked up by the mics?

02:07:31.000 --> 02:07:33.000
Probably a lot

02:07:33.000 --> 02:07:35.000
I don't care, my nose feels

02:07:35.000 --> 02:07:37.000
like crap

02:07:37.000 --> 02:07:39.000
Hey, we want to get into the FUs of the week

02:07:39.000 --> 02:07:41.000
actually, before we get back into

02:07:41.000 --> 02:07:43.000
the little show here

02:07:43.000 --> 02:07:45.000
and the news stories

02:07:45.000 --> 02:07:47.000
No story to inspire

02:07:47.000 --> 02:07:49.000
our FUs of the week tonight

02:07:49.000 --> 02:07:51.000
I have a story

02:07:51.000 --> 02:07:53.000
I hate my nose, that's the story

02:07:53.000 --> 02:08:05.000
of the media

02:08:05.000 --> 02:08:07.000
This is fucked up

02:08:07.000 --> 02:08:09.000
FU to my nose

02:08:09.000 --> 02:08:11.000
and dust

02:08:11.000 --> 02:08:13.000
and did I mention

02:08:13.000 --> 02:08:15.000
my nose? Because FU to my

02:08:15.000 --> 02:08:17.000
fucking nose and the fucking dust

02:08:17.000 --> 02:08:19.000
FU to people

02:08:19.000 --> 02:08:21.000
that have a story about everything

02:08:21.000 --> 02:08:23.000
and I mean, like, we were watching

02:08:23.000 --> 02:08:25.000
people on the subway

02:08:25.000 --> 02:08:27.000
you know, riding Bart this weekend

02:08:27.000 --> 02:08:29.000
and there was

02:08:29.000 --> 02:08:31.000
on the way there, a woman who was talking

02:08:31.000 --> 02:08:33.000
about, you know, for some

02:08:33.000 --> 02:08:35.000
reason, she was going like

02:08:35.000 --> 02:08:37.000
oh, I hope you have fun today and that

02:08:37.000 --> 02:08:39.000
turned into like, yeah, my daughter

02:08:39.000 --> 02:08:41.000
went to this convention and she got

02:08:41.000 --> 02:08:43.000
to see Miley Cyrus and blah blah blah

02:08:43.000 --> 02:08:45.000
blah blah blah blah blah and it's like, yeah, well

02:08:45.000 --> 02:08:47.000
you know, my daughter lives

02:08:47.000 --> 02:08:49.000
in Texas now, oh, and we went to Texas

02:08:49.000 --> 02:08:51.000
then there was this bum

02:08:51.000 --> 02:08:53.000
that did the same thing, talking

02:08:53.000 --> 02:08:55.000
to this blind woman, so not only is she blind

02:08:55.000 --> 02:08:57.000
she's being berated by this

02:08:57.000 --> 02:08:59.000
guy who says he's rich, but yet

02:08:59.000 --> 02:09:01.000
has a bag full of cans with him

02:09:01.000 --> 02:09:03.000
so that's bullshit

02:09:03.000 --> 02:09:05.000
Maybe he's into recycling

02:09:05.000 --> 02:09:07.000
Maybe he's rich in cans

02:09:07.000 --> 02:09:09.000
because cans is the new currency

02:09:09.000 --> 02:09:11.000
Yeah, I'm under

02:09:11.000 --> 02:09:13.000
the regime of President Cat

02:09:13.000 --> 02:09:15.000
But he, Catnip

02:09:15.000 --> 02:09:17.000
is the new currency

02:09:17.000 --> 02:09:19.000
But, it's just, these

02:09:19.000 --> 02:09:21.000
people though, just annoy

02:09:21.000 --> 02:09:23.000
the hell out of me, that like, try to one up

02:09:23.000 --> 02:09:25.000
everybody's stories and stuff like that, you know

02:09:25.000 --> 02:09:27.000
how they have, you know, oh yeah

02:09:27.000 --> 02:09:29.000
my cousin lives there, and oh

02:09:29.000 --> 02:09:31.000
I went there and did sheet metal work

02:09:31.000 --> 02:09:33.000
and oh, and my dog was

02:09:33.000 --> 02:09:35.000
from that country and stuff, and like

02:09:35.000 --> 02:09:37.000
Is there a character like that on Saturday Night Live?

02:09:37.000 --> 02:09:39.000
Yes, there is. Alright, yeah, yeah, yeah

02:09:39.000 --> 02:09:41.000
I had ten baby cows

02:09:41.000 --> 02:09:43.000
I can't believe Logan

02:09:43.000 --> 02:09:45.000
just did a great impression of that

02:09:45.000 --> 02:09:47.000
we do impressions

02:09:47.000 --> 02:09:49.000
of that woman all the time

02:09:49.000 --> 02:09:51.000
especially when we see people like this

02:09:51.000 --> 02:09:53.000
and we were doing that too, like while she was talking

02:09:53.000 --> 02:09:55.000
and I was like

02:09:55.000 --> 02:09:57.000
and yeah, and then we had Miley Cyrus follow us

02:09:57.000 --> 02:09:59.000
and we were like making fun of her the entire day

02:09:59.000 --> 02:10:01.000
and Miley Cyrus followed us, right?

02:10:01.000 --> 02:10:03.000
and she was playing music for us

02:10:03.000 --> 02:10:05.000
and then, uh

02:10:05.000 --> 02:10:07.000
then we went to our house on the moon

02:10:07.000 --> 02:10:09.000
and Miley Cyrus followed us

02:10:09.000 --> 02:10:11.000
because she's our slave

02:10:11.000 --> 02:10:13.000
so yeah

02:10:13.000 --> 02:10:15.000
I hate people who have served better

02:10:15.000 --> 02:10:17.000
oh god

02:10:17.000 --> 02:10:19.000
I can't follow that up, that's amazing

02:10:19.000 --> 02:10:21.000
um, I guess my only F.U. would

02:10:21.000 --> 02:10:23.000
go to stress

02:10:23.000 --> 02:10:25.000
because I have quite a lot of it at work right now

02:10:25.000 --> 02:10:27.000
but, you know, it happens

02:10:27.000 --> 02:10:29.000
and F.U. did the fact that I haven't updated

02:10:29.000 --> 02:10:31.000
LiveJournal in like three weeks

02:10:31.000 --> 02:10:33.000
like I'm seriously falling behind on that stuff

02:10:33.000 --> 02:10:35.000
and uh, yeah

02:10:35.000 --> 02:10:37.000
I don't like feeling behind

02:10:37.000 --> 02:10:39.000
on my life

02:10:39.000 --> 02:10:41.000
Kristen Wiig, that's, oh yeah, she's

02:10:41.000 --> 02:10:43.000
like the only woman on that show right now, isn't she?

02:10:43.000 --> 02:10:45.000
Did they ever fire the one that dropped

02:10:45.000 --> 02:10:47.000
the F-bomb on air?

02:10:47.000 --> 02:10:49.000
Who was that? Some new chick

02:10:49.000 --> 02:10:51.000
remember like her first show, like she dropped

02:10:51.000 --> 02:10:53.000
the F-bomb because they gave her a character

02:10:53.000 --> 02:10:55.000
that said frickin' frickin' frickin' every other word

02:10:55.000 --> 02:10:57.000
and one time she just slipped and said, fuck it

02:10:57.000 --> 02:10:59.000
I would have done the same thing

02:10:59.000 --> 02:11:01.000
I kind of felt bad for her

02:11:01.000 --> 02:11:03.000
so, anyhow

02:11:03.000 --> 02:11:05.000
in Reddertainment we like to point out the name of that character is

02:11:05.000 --> 02:11:07.000
Penelope, the one-upper

02:11:07.000 --> 02:11:09.000
there you go

02:11:09.000 --> 02:11:11.000
and the name bless you to Jamie because they can all hear her nose

02:11:11.000 --> 02:11:13.000
sorry!

02:11:13.000 --> 02:11:15.000
Thank you everybody, I love you

02:11:15.000 --> 02:11:17.000
alright, couple more news stories for you guys

02:11:17.000 --> 02:11:19.000
then the Skype line at 1877-GAME-OLR

02:11:19.000 --> 02:11:21.000
Loki?

02:11:21.000 --> 02:11:23.000
Yes, so um

02:11:23.000 --> 02:11:25.000
personally, I haven't played this game yet

02:11:25.000 --> 02:11:27.000
I acquired it for my MAME cabinet

02:11:27.000 --> 02:11:29.000
earlier today, but the game is

02:11:29.000 --> 02:11:31.000
Toki, it's a

02:11:31.000 --> 02:11:33.000
2D side-scrolling game starring a

02:11:33.000 --> 02:11:35.000
ape, and apparently

02:11:35.000 --> 02:11:37.000
it's getting the HD treatment

02:11:37.000 --> 02:11:39.000
the French developer

02:11:39.000 --> 02:11:41.000
Golgoth Studio

02:11:41.000 --> 02:11:43.000
is taking the game and completely redoing all the graphics

02:11:43.000 --> 02:11:45.000
and it actually looks pretty cool

02:11:45.000 --> 02:11:47.000
so I hope the game is fun

02:11:47.000 --> 02:11:49.000
but it looks like it's all

02:11:49.000 --> 02:11:51.000
hand-drawn now and

02:11:51.000 --> 02:11:53.000
I don't know, it's the stuff you would normally

02:11:53.000 --> 02:11:55.000
expect on box art

02:11:55.000 --> 02:11:57.000
but

02:11:57.000 --> 02:11:59.000
it's all in motion now

02:11:59.000 --> 02:12:01.000
huh

02:12:01.000 --> 02:12:03.000
but apparently it'll be coming out for games for Windows Live

02:12:03.000 --> 02:12:05.000
and Xbox Live Arcade

02:12:05.000 --> 02:12:07.000
so it's not like a

02:12:07.000 --> 02:12:09.000
full retail game, it's kind of more of a

02:12:09.000 --> 02:12:11.000
mini-game if it's coming out on Arcade, but it

02:12:11.000 --> 02:12:13.000
looked kind of neat from the screen

02:12:13.000 --> 02:12:15.000
it could still be a full game, yeah

02:12:15.000 --> 02:12:17.000
it looks neat

02:12:17.000 --> 02:12:19.000
interesting

02:12:19.000 --> 02:12:21.000
well, here's some games that didn't do so great when they

02:12:21.000 --> 02:12:23.000
came out, this story kind of caught our attention

02:12:23.000 --> 02:12:25.000
and I don't like a whole lot of these

02:12:25.000 --> 02:12:27.000
top 10 kind of lists, but this particular piece

02:12:27.000 --> 02:12:29.000
on GamesRadar.com, I thought was kind of

02:12:29.000 --> 02:12:31.000
interesting, they ran a piece earlier this week called

02:12:31.000 --> 02:12:33.000
18 Awesome Games That Died at Retail

02:12:33.000 --> 02:12:35.000
and what I thought about reading this

02:12:35.000 --> 02:12:37.000
list is I wanted to see how many of these

02:12:37.000 --> 02:12:39.000
games, Jamie being the collector of

02:12:39.000 --> 02:12:41.000
obscure ass video games, was going to pipe up

02:12:41.000 --> 02:12:43.000
and say, that game was awesome

02:12:43.000 --> 02:12:45.000
so we'll see what happens, so Jamie

02:12:45.000 --> 02:12:47.000
would you like to hear about the 18 awesome

02:12:47.000 --> 02:12:49.000
games that died at retail? Sure

02:12:49.000 --> 02:12:51.000
okay, the first one was Metal Arms

02:12:51.000 --> 02:12:53.000
Glitch in the System, and they

02:12:53.000 --> 02:12:55.000
say this game didn't do too well just

02:12:55.000 --> 02:12:57.000
because it was too kitty for serious

02:12:57.000 --> 02:12:59.000
gamers and vice versa

02:12:59.000 --> 02:13:01.000
Beyond Good and Evil on

02:13:01.000 --> 02:13:03.000
the Playstation 2. I think

02:13:03.000 --> 02:13:05.000
I have that. That's

02:13:05.000 --> 02:13:07.000
one of those big games on GameTap I think

02:13:07.000 --> 02:13:09.000
they were really selling that when that first came out

02:13:09.000 --> 02:13:11.000
again, this is a list from GamesRadar, 18

02:13:11.000 --> 02:13:13.000
games that died at retail

02:13:13.000 --> 02:13:15.000
Grand Theft Auto Chinatown War is a

02:13:15.000 --> 02:13:17.000
more recent game coming out because

02:13:17.000 --> 02:13:19.000
folks saying there's not enough mature games

02:13:19.000 --> 02:13:21.000
for the system, but at the same time

02:13:21.000 --> 02:13:23.000
not enough Nintendo fans wanting mature games

02:13:23.000 --> 02:13:25.000
Why did this die, Loki?

02:13:25.000 --> 02:13:27.000
I didn't really

02:13:27.000 --> 02:13:29.000
care to, you know, I didn't like

02:13:29.000 --> 02:13:31.000
the way it played just because it was a top

02:13:31.000 --> 02:13:33.000
down game

02:13:33.000 --> 02:13:35.000
I prefer more of like the

02:13:35.000 --> 02:13:37.000
PSP versions and stuff that are

02:13:37.000 --> 02:13:39.000
more of the 3D stuff you would see on

02:13:39.000 --> 02:13:41.000
Playstation 2. I understand why they did it that way

02:13:41.000 --> 02:13:43.000
because the

02:13:43.000 --> 02:13:45.000
system might not be able to handle that

02:13:45.000 --> 02:13:47.000
However, now we see that

02:13:47.000 --> 02:13:49.000
Cop of the Recruit is coming

02:13:49.000 --> 02:13:51.000
out from Ubisoft and looks like

02:13:51.000 --> 02:13:53.000
what the Playstation

02:13:53.000 --> 02:13:55.000
portable versions of Grand Theft Auto were

02:13:55.000 --> 02:13:57.000
so it is possible to do

02:13:57.000 --> 02:13:59.000
it that way, but they decided not to

02:13:59.000 --> 02:14:01.000
I think it will have a better

02:14:01.000 --> 02:14:03.000
chance on the PSP probably

02:14:03.000 --> 02:14:05.000
Moving on with the list from GamesRadar.com

02:14:05.000 --> 02:14:07.000
Psychonauts, of course

02:14:07.000 --> 02:14:09.000
I'm sure a list like this just wouldn't be complete without

02:14:09.000 --> 02:14:11.000
Psychonauts. It gets a lot of

02:14:11.000 --> 02:14:13.000
praise all around. It was something that was

02:14:13.000 --> 02:14:15.000
originally supposed to be an exclusive for Microsoft

02:14:15.000 --> 02:14:17.000
but then got killed and brought back and just

02:14:17.000 --> 02:14:19.000
didn't really have a serious marketing push behind it

02:14:19.000 --> 02:14:21.000
I know Jamie will get behind

02:14:21.000 --> 02:14:23.000
this one, Jet Grind Radio on the Dreamcast

02:14:23.000 --> 02:14:25.000
one of the 18

02:14:25.000 --> 02:14:27.000
games that tanked here. Unfortunately

02:14:27.000 --> 02:14:29.000
just being the fact that it was on the Dreamcast

02:14:29.000 --> 02:14:31.000
console

02:14:31.000 --> 02:14:33.000
kind of

02:14:33.000 --> 02:14:35.000
put a damper in it there

02:14:35.000 --> 02:14:37.000
Metal Storm

02:14:37.000 --> 02:14:39.000
is on this list. This is an

02:14:39.000 --> 02:14:41.000
old ass NES side scrolling

02:14:41.000 --> 02:14:43.000
game like on the old school 8-bit

02:14:43.000 --> 02:14:45.000
That was pretty sweet too

02:14:45.000 --> 02:14:47.000
But unfortunately it didn't really

02:14:47.000 --> 02:14:49.000
sell very well. They're saying

02:14:49.000 --> 02:14:51.000
it might have something to do with the fact that it was a

02:14:51.000 --> 02:14:53.000
crappy localization process and

02:14:53.000 --> 02:14:55.000
the cutscenes were taken out when it was brought

02:14:55.000 --> 02:14:57.000
over and it screwed with the color palette

02:14:57.000 --> 02:14:59.000
Shenmue 2

02:14:59.000 --> 02:15:01.000
on the Xbox

02:15:01.000 --> 02:15:03.000
I think I have that somewhere

02:15:03.000 --> 02:15:05.000
Unfortunately this series just kind of

02:15:05.000 --> 02:15:07.000
never really seemed to catch on. It's one of those things

02:15:07.000 --> 02:15:09.000
that went later on

02:15:09.000 --> 02:15:11.000
kind of as a cult status

02:15:13.000 --> 02:15:15.000
Moving on with this list again from

02:15:15.000 --> 02:15:17.000
GamesRadar.com. 18 awesome

02:15:17.000 --> 02:15:19.000
games that died at retail

02:15:19.000 --> 02:15:21.000
Anything you guys would put on this list that you haven't

02:15:21.000 --> 02:15:23.000
heard yet? While I'm waiting for the next page

02:15:23.000 --> 02:15:25.000
to load here

02:15:25.000 --> 02:15:27.000
Earth Defense Force

02:15:27.000 --> 02:15:29.000
Oddworld

02:15:29.000 --> 02:15:31.000
Stranger's Wrath on the

02:15:31.000 --> 02:15:33.000
Xbox is on the list

02:15:33.000 --> 02:15:35.000
Armed and Dangerous for the PC

02:15:35.000 --> 02:15:37.000
Otogi 2

02:15:37.000 --> 02:15:39.000
Immortal Warriors. I never even heard of

02:15:39.000 --> 02:15:41.000
this game but it was a Japanese

02:15:41.000 --> 02:15:43.000
hack and slasher about an ancient swordsman

02:15:43.000 --> 02:15:45.000
It was a sequel

02:15:45.000 --> 02:15:47.000
to a game that apparently didn't do too well in the

02:15:47.000 --> 02:15:49.000
first place. Space Station

02:15:49.000 --> 02:15:51.000
Silicon Valley on the N64

02:15:51.000 --> 02:15:53.000
It was kind of a whimsical little

02:15:53.000 --> 02:15:55.000
platformer robot animal type of game

02:15:55.000 --> 02:15:57.000
that just got lost in the whole

02:15:57.000 --> 02:15:59.000
N64 not being one of

02:15:59.000 --> 02:16:01.000
Nintendo's greatest systems

02:16:01.000 --> 02:16:03.000
Panzer Dragoon Orta

02:16:03.000 --> 02:16:05.000
from 2003 is on the list

02:16:05.000 --> 02:16:07.000
That was a good game

02:16:07.000 --> 02:16:09.000
The Last Express

02:16:09.000 --> 02:16:11.000
That was kind of like a stylish

02:16:11.000 --> 02:16:13.000
game. I remember this game Thief Deadly

02:16:13.000 --> 02:16:15.000
Shadows on the Xbox

02:16:15.000 --> 02:16:17.000
did not do too well. I guess maybe that was

02:16:17.000 --> 02:16:19.000
more of a PC game. I'm not sure

02:16:19.000 --> 02:16:21.000
Jet Set Radio Future

02:16:21.000 --> 02:16:23.000
also made the list

02:16:23.000 --> 02:16:25.000
They say it kind of

02:16:25.000 --> 02:16:27.000
alienated fans of the first game

02:16:27.000 --> 02:16:29.000
Bionic Commando on the

02:16:29.000 --> 02:16:31.000
360 and PS3 I don't think did very well

02:16:31.000 --> 02:16:33.000
Interesting all things considered

02:16:33.000 --> 02:16:35.000
Do you think maybe

02:16:35.000 --> 02:16:37.000
I wonder if the 2D one did better than that

02:16:37.000 --> 02:16:39.000
Yeah it did a lot better

02:16:39.000 --> 02:16:41.000
I think because the game kind of

02:16:41.000 --> 02:16:43.000
I think people were just tied to their memories of the old school

02:16:43.000 --> 02:16:45.000
game and weren't ready for the whole 3D-ification

02:16:45.000 --> 02:16:47.000
of it, you know

02:16:47.000 --> 02:16:49.000
Yeah, there might have been issues with the game

02:16:49.000 --> 02:16:51.000
Grim Fandango

02:16:51.000 --> 02:16:53.000
also on the list, getting down towards

02:16:53.000 --> 02:16:55.000
the end here. The Neverhood

02:16:55.000 --> 02:16:57.000
from 1996 on the list

02:16:57.000 --> 02:16:59.000
and last but not least

02:16:59.000 --> 02:17:01.000
Okami made the list which isn't

02:17:01.000 --> 02:17:03.000
surprising at all and the reason why

02:17:03.000 --> 02:17:05.000
Okami kind of got burned, it was out on the

02:17:05.000 --> 02:17:07.000
Playstation 2 kind of when the next generation

02:17:07.000 --> 02:17:09.000
of games was already starting and the

02:17:09.000 --> 02:17:11.000
PS2 was already dying out for a lot of hardcore

02:17:11.000 --> 02:17:13.000
gamers. I think that was one of the biggest problems with Final Fantasy

02:17:13.000 --> 02:17:15.000
12, I think it came out too late

02:17:15.000 --> 02:17:17.000
I think by the time Final Fantasy 12 came out

02:17:17.000 --> 02:17:19.000
it should have been on the next gen system

02:17:19.000 --> 02:17:21.000
But that's just me

02:17:21.000 --> 02:17:23.000
So, alright

02:17:23.000 --> 02:17:25.000
I guess we're getting to that part of the

02:17:25.000 --> 02:17:27.000
show where we're going to open up the Skype line

02:17:27.000 --> 02:17:29.000
and hear from you guys

02:17:29.000 --> 02:17:31.000
1-877-GAME-OLR is the number you want

02:17:31.000 --> 02:17:33.000
to call if you want to get on the show or you can just

02:17:33.000 --> 02:17:35.000
Skype us directly at Orange Lounge Radio

02:17:35.000 --> 02:17:37.000
I do want to give a little disclaimer first, we've been having

02:17:37.000 --> 02:17:39.000
problems with Skype the past couple weeks

02:17:39.000 --> 02:17:41.000
where we've been randomly hanging up on callers

02:17:41.000 --> 02:17:43.000
We did upgrade to a new version of Skype

02:17:43.000 --> 02:17:45.000
today, so

02:17:45.000 --> 02:17:47.000
we're on the latest and greatest version of Skype

02:17:47.000 --> 02:17:49.000
I'm hoping that we'll fix our problems

02:17:49.000 --> 02:17:51.000
We hadn't upgraded in a long time

02:17:51.000 --> 02:17:53.000
I'm hoping that we'll fix our problems, but we don't

02:17:53.000 --> 02:17:55.000
know what's going to happen, we still may have

02:17:55.000 --> 02:17:57.000
some issues tonight, so bear with us

02:17:57.000 --> 02:17:59.000
But again, the number 1-877-GAME-OLR

02:17:59.000 --> 02:18:01.000
if you want to give us a call

02:18:01.000 --> 02:18:03.000
Meanwhile, do we have any last minute stories we want to get to

02:18:03.000 --> 02:18:05.000
while we wait for some calls?

02:18:05.000 --> 02:18:07.000
Sure, we'll talk about a game called Inversion

02:18:07.000 --> 02:18:09.000
which actually looks pretty sweet

02:18:09.000 --> 02:18:11.000
and of course, the developer

02:18:11.000 --> 02:18:13.000
of Timeshift, Saber Interactive

02:18:13.000 --> 02:18:15.000
they're doing a new shooter

02:18:15.000 --> 02:18:17.000
that kind of takes place during

02:18:17.000 --> 02:18:19.000
an invasion by aliens called

02:18:19.000 --> 02:18:21.000
Ludador, and what happens

02:18:21.000 --> 02:18:23.000
they have these anti-gravity

02:18:23.000 --> 02:18:25.000
bubbles, they're calling them

02:18:25.000 --> 02:18:27.000
gravitational vectors

02:18:27.000 --> 02:18:29.000
that appear in the game, changing the gravity

02:18:29.000 --> 02:18:31.000
in different directions and also

02:18:31.000 --> 02:18:33.000
becomes part of the game where you can flip stuff

02:18:33.000 --> 02:18:35.000
upside down and whatnot

02:18:35.000 --> 02:18:37.000
It's kind of cool, and they have a new weapon

02:18:37.000 --> 02:18:39.000
in the game called a grappler that allows you to

02:18:39.000 --> 02:18:41.000
manipulate gravity as well and move objects

02:18:41.000 --> 02:18:43.000
around stuff, so that's kind of cool

02:18:43.000 --> 02:18:45.000
and it looks like that'll be due out on the

02:18:45.000 --> 02:18:47.000
Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 in

02:18:47.000 --> 02:18:49.000
2010

02:18:49.000 --> 02:18:51.000
Let's go to the phones and take a call

02:18:51.000 --> 02:18:53.000
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?

02:18:55.000 --> 02:18:57.000
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?

02:18:59.000 --> 02:19:01.000
Hola, bienvenidos a Orange

02:19:01.000 --> 02:19:03.000
Launch Radio, quien es?

02:19:03.000 --> 02:19:05.000
Remember

02:19:05.000 --> 02:19:07.000
you should always check your microphone

02:19:07.000 --> 02:19:09.000
connection calling

02:19:09.000 --> 02:19:11.000
Echo 123 on Skype

02:19:11.000 --> 02:19:13.000
before you give us a call, otherwise

02:19:13.000 --> 02:19:15.000
it may not work, but I could swear I heard somebody

02:19:15.000 --> 02:19:17.000
breathing there, maybe they just couldn't hear us for some reason

02:19:17.000 --> 02:19:19.000
I did, I heard someone breathing

02:19:19.000 --> 02:19:21.000
I could too, so I don't know what the hell was going on there

02:19:21.000 --> 02:19:23.000
So somebody was not paying attention

02:19:23.000 --> 02:19:25.000
Don't know

02:19:25.000 --> 02:19:27.000
what happened there

02:19:27.000 --> 02:19:29.000
Do we have any other, well actually

02:19:29.000 --> 02:19:31.000
here we go, we got another call coming in

02:19:31.000 --> 02:19:33.000
Orange Launch Radio, who's this?

02:19:33.000 --> 02:19:35.000
Hey, it's SSJ100 Matt

02:19:35.000 --> 02:19:37.000
Hey SSJ100 Matt, how are you?

02:19:39.000 --> 02:19:41.000
I'm doing good, quite a while

02:19:41.000 --> 02:19:43.000
You're cutting out a little bit

02:19:43.000 --> 02:19:45.000
I don't know what's going on, but what are you

02:19:45.000 --> 02:19:47.000
up to tonight?

02:19:47.000 --> 02:19:49.000
I've actually just got out of

02:19:49.000 --> 02:19:51.000
Video Games Live

02:19:51.000 --> 02:19:53.000
Video Games Live,

02:19:53.000 --> 02:19:55.000
was it in New York City tonight?

02:19:55.000 --> 02:19:57.000
It was

02:19:57.000 --> 02:19:59.000
How was the show?

02:19:59.000 --> 02:20:01.000
It was great, you know

02:20:01.000 --> 02:20:03.000
I went to other shows

02:20:03.000 --> 02:20:05.000
before, you know, I went to the Dear Friends concert

02:20:05.000 --> 02:20:07.000
a while back when it was done around

02:20:07.000 --> 02:20:09.000
and this was

02:20:09.000 --> 02:20:11.000
you know, a lot more

02:20:11.000 --> 02:20:13.000
this is a lot better

02:20:13.000 --> 02:20:15.000
Well, was this your first Video Games Live

02:20:15.000 --> 02:20:17.000
that you've been to?

02:20:17.000 --> 02:20:19.000
This is the first one I've been to

02:20:19.000 --> 02:20:21.000
What was kind of the highlight of the show

02:20:21.000 --> 02:20:23.000
for you, you think?

02:20:23.000 --> 02:20:25.000
Well

02:20:25.000 --> 02:20:27.000
I think the best

02:20:27.000 --> 02:20:29.000
was when he did the encore

02:20:29.000 --> 02:20:31.000
it was Chrono Trigger

02:20:31.000 --> 02:20:33.000
Because it was kind of

02:20:33.000 --> 02:20:35.000
you know, he thought he wasn't going to be playing it

02:20:35.000 --> 02:20:37.000
and then he came out

02:20:37.000 --> 02:20:39.000
said this was the number one requested song

02:20:39.000 --> 02:20:41.000
the piece that everyone

02:20:41.000 --> 02:20:43.000
wanted to Video Games Live

02:20:43.000 --> 02:20:45.000
And I just want to point out

02:20:45.000 --> 02:20:47.000
we realize SSJ100 Matt

02:20:47.000 --> 02:20:49.000
is breaking up, his connection

02:20:49.000 --> 02:20:51.000
is kind of crap, I don't know if that's because of the new

02:20:51.000 --> 02:20:53.000
Skype or what's going on, but we're going to try

02:20:53.000 --> 02:20:55.000
and get through this because I want to talk about

02:20:55.000 --> 02:20:57.000
Video Games Live a little bit. The Chrono Trigger piece

02:20:57.000 --> 02:20:59.000
we were there

02:20:59.000 --> 02:21:01.000
the night that debuted in Oakland

02:21:01.000 --> 02:21:03.000
that was an awesome night, so a good piece

02:21:03.000 --> 02:21:05.000
I'm glad that came out

02:21:05.000 --> 02:21:07.000
Any lowlights?

02:21:07.000 --> 02:21:09.000
Were there songs that they were playing

02:21:09.000 --> 02:21:11.000
where you were kind of like, they could have bumped

02:21:11.000 --> 02:21:13.000
this for something else?

02:21:13.000 --> 02:21:17.000
Not really, I mean

02:21:17.000 --> 02:21:19.000
I was

02:21:19.000 --> 02:21:21.000
it was cool that they bought

02:21:21.000 --> 02:21:23.000
Mega Man, which I don't think

02:21:23.000 --> 02:21:25.000
they bought

02:21:25.000 --> 02:21:27.000
in previous video shows

02:21:27.000 --> 02:21:29.000
but

02:21:29.000 --> 02:21:31.000
the note did change

02:21:31.000 --> 02:21:33.000
they did play

02:21:33.000 --> 02:21:35.000
Castlevania songs

02:21:35.000 --> 02:21:37.000
Ah, Castlevania

02:21:37.000 --> 02:21:39.000
Did they have any guests show up?

02:21:39.000 --> 02:21:41.000
Because sometimes they have random guests show up at these things

02:21:41.000 --> 02:21:43.000
Well they did have

02:21:43.000 --> 02:21:45.000
a kid from YouTube

02:21:45.000 --> 02:21:47.000
that played

02:21:47.000 --> 02:21:49.000
Mario songs blindfolded

02:21:49.000 --> 02:21:51.000
Oh, on the piano?

02:21:51.000 --> 02:21:53.000
Yeah, I think Tommy

02:21:53.000 --> 02:21:55.000
has him on the payroll or something

02:21:55.000 --> 02:21:57.000
he follows him everywhere

02:21:57.000 --> 02:21:59.000
And also, good show

02:21:59.000 --> 02:22:01.000
they

02:22:01.000 --> 02:22:03.000
called in

02:22:03.000 --> 02:22:05.000
I'm trying to think of the name, Ross Bear

02:22:05.000 --> 02:22:07.000
the creator of Pong

02:22:07.000 --> 02:22:09.000
Oh, nice

02:22:09.000 --> 02:22:11.000
So, that was interesting

02:22:11.000 --> 02:22:13.000
Alright, well as I was showing them out

02:22:13.000 --> 02:22:15.000
we're going to let you go because the connection is kind of

02:22:15.000 --> 02:22:17.000
a bit crap, but thank you so much

02:22:17.000 --> 02:22:19.000
for calling in

02:22:19.000 --> 02:22:21.000
Yeah, I'm actually in

02:22:21.000 --> 02:22:23.000
watching the rest of the Yankee

02:22:23.000 --> 02:22:25.000
show, sorry about that

02:22:25.000 --> 02:22:27.000
Alright, well take care

02:22:27.000 --> 02:22:29.000
and thanks for giving us a call

02:22:29.000 --> 02:22:31.000
and it's good to hear that the show is still going

02:22:31.000 --> 02:22:33.000
and traveling across the nation. Take care, buddy

02:22:35.000 --> 02:22:37.000
Alright

02:22:37.000 --> 02:22:39.000
Let's see

02:22:39.000 --> 02:22:41.000
Moving on to more

02:22:41.000 --> 02:22:43.000
calls and more last minute stories

02:22:43.000 --> 02:22:45.000
here on Orange Longest Radio

02:22:45.000 --> 02:22:47.000
I hope that was just an isolated thing

02:22:47.000 --> 02:22:49.000
and not something that's going to continue

02:22:49.000 --> 02:22:51.000
We'll see, hopefully

02:22:51.000 --> 02:22:53.000
He said he was somewhere, I don't know, he was cutting out

02:22:53.000 --> 02:22:55.000
I think he said he was at a game or something, so we'll see

02:22:55.000 --> 02:22:57.000
We'll try to get a couple more calls here

02:22:57.000 --> 02:22:59.000
877-Game-O-L-R

02:22:59.000 --> 02:23:01.000
Loki, do you have any other last minute stories?

02:23:01.000 --> 02:23:03.000
Yeah, DiRT 2 is heading to PC's in December

02:23:03.000 --> 02:23:05.000
It's going to be one of the first games using DirectX 11

02:23:05.000 --> 02:23:07.000
and apparently they were shown off during the big

02:23:07.000 --> 02:23:09.000
Windows 7 launch party in New York City

02:23:11.000 --> 02:23:13.000
Hmm, it's very sexy looking

02:23:13.000 --> 02:23:15.000
Alright, let's go to the phones

02:23:15.000 --> 02:23:17.000
Hi, you're on Orange Longest Radio, who's this?

02:23:17.000 --> 02:23:19.000
This is DS Master 25

02:23:19.000 --> 02:23:21.000
Hi, DS Master 25, what's on your mind?

02:23:23.000 --> 02:23:25.000
Well, kinda

02:23:25.000 --> 02:23:27.000
sad story today

02:23:27.000 --> 02:23:29.000
What's that?

02:23:33.000 --> 02:23:35.000
As soon as I get done

02:23:35.000 --> 02:23:37.000
What the hell is going on?

02:23:37.000 --> 02:23:39.000
Is somebody breaking a dish behind you?

02:23:39.000 --> 02:23:41.000
What is going on?

02:23:41.000 --> 02:23:43.000
My mother

02:23:43.000 --> 02:23:45.000
Basically my DS

02:23:45.000 --> 02:23:47.000
Who are you talking to?

02:23:47.000 --> 02:23:49.000
I'm on the radio, mom

02:23:49.000 --> 02:23:51.000
Come on

02:23:51.000 --> 02:23:53.000
It's 11 o'clock

02:23:53.000 --> 02:23:55.000
Basically

02:23:55.000 --> 02:23:57.000
the L button on my DS side died

02:23:57.000 --> 02:23:59.000
and it's only been like a few months

02:23:59.000 --> 02:24:01.000
and

02:24:01.000 --> 02:24:03.000
I don't know if any of our listeners have had that problem

02:24:05.000 --> 02:24:07.000
Is your mom mad that you're calling in

02:24:07.000 --> 02:24:09.000
so late?

02:24:09.000 --> 02:24:11.000
Probably

02:24:11.000 --> 02:24:13.000
You shouldn't say Jesus in front of your mother like that

02:24:13.000 --> 02:24:15.000
That's usually frowned upon, just so you know

02:24:19.000 --> 02:24:21.000
You realize your whole call has just been shot

02:24:21.000 --> 02:24:23.000
because now everybody's just saying

02:24:23.000 --> 02:24:25.000
Mom, I'm on the radio

02:24:27.000 --> 02:24:29.000
I'm sorry, but

02:24:29.000 --> 02:24:31.000
basically my

02:24:31.000 --> 02:24:33.000
DSi, the stupid L button

02:24:33.000 --> 02:24:35.000
stopped working in the middle of 3D

02:24:35.000 --> 02:24:37.000
pinball

02:24:37.000 --> 02:24:39.000
I'm sorry to hear it

02:24:39.000 --> 02:24:41.000
But mom's not gonna

02:24:41.000 --> 02:24:43.000
buy you a new one if you keep staying up late

02:24:43.000 --> 02:24:45.000
to call stupid internet radio programs

02:24:45.000 --> 02:24:47.000
Well, anyways

02:24:47.000 --> 02:24:49.000
I do have a good game review though

02:24:49.000 --> 02:24:51.000
Kingdom Hearts

02:24:51.000 --> 02:24:53.000
can be on a date over two days

02:24:55.000 --> 02:24:57.000
I will say here

02:24:57.000 --> 02:24:59.000
I've been a long time Square fan

02:24:59.000 --> 02:25:01.000
even though I kinda

02:25:01.000 --> 02:25:03.000
despise them on the first Kingdom Hearts

02:25:03.000 --> 02:25:05.000
because I'm like, what the hell are you thinking

02:25:05.000 --> 02:25:07.000
I'm playing with Disney?

02:25:07.000 --> 02:25:09.000
You're stupid

02:25:09.000 --> 02:25:11.000
Well, you know

02:25:11.000 --> 02:25:13.000
if I'm telling you, don't knock it till you try it

02:25:13.000 --> 02:25:15.000
So, uh, you know

02:25:15.000 --> 02:25:17.000
and I still love the series right then and there

02:25:17.000 --> 02:25:19.000
and

02:25:19.000 --> 02:25:21.000
when Kyrie left

02:25:21.000 --> 02:25:23.000
I kinda cried

02:25:23.000 --> 02:25:25.000
and

02:25:25.000 --> 02:25:27.000
basically now I'm still on the search for

02:25:27.000 --> 02:25:29.000
in this one, which is supposed to be the

02:25:29.000 --> 02:25:31.000
real link between

02:25:31.000 --> 02:25:33.000
one and two

02:25:33.000 --> 02:25:35.000
I was fortunate enough to sell my Playstation 2 op

02:25:35.000 --> 02:25:37.000
because they're overdraft

02:25:37.000 --> 02:25:39.000
but I'm planning on getting one again

02:25:39.000 --> 02:25:41.000
just to play the rest of the Kingdom Hearts series

02:25:41.000 --> 02:25:43.000
again

02:25:43.000 --> 02:25:45.000
Your mom didn't see you crying in a video game

02:25:45.000 --> 02:25:47.000
did she?

02:25:47.000 --> 02:25:49.000
No, my girlfriend did

02:25:49.000 --> 02:25:51.000
though, and she kinda cried along

02:25:51.000 --> 02:25:53.000
because she's like, no Kyrie

02:25:53.000 --> 02:25:55.000
don't leave

02:25:55.000 --> 02:25:57.000
Well that's okay, you know, chicks seeing you cry

02:25:57.000 --> 02:25:59.000
that just scores you points with them

02:25:59.000 --> 02:26:01.000
but you don't want your mom to see you cry because then she thinks you're a wimp

02:26:01.000 --> 02:26:03.000
Alright

02:26:03.000 --> 02:26:05.000
Yeah, I'm posting my father is already

02:26:05.000 --> 02:26:07.000
bashing the whole Hannah Montana

02:26:07.000 --> 02:26:09.000
stuff and saying, at least you're playing good music

02:26:09.000 --> 02:26:11.000
Wait, are you

02:26:11.000 --> 02:26:13.000
a Hannah Montana fan?

02:26:13.000 --> 02:26:15.000
I was the one who sent in

02:26:15.000 --> 02:26:17.000
that angry message, you know

02:26:17.000 --> 02:26:19.000
remember, leave Hannah alone

02:26:19.000 --> 02:26:21.000
Do you guys remember that?

02:26:21.000 --> 02:26:23.000
I try every day to forget

02:26:23.000 --> 02:26:25.000
Episode 271

02:26:25.000 --> 02:26:27.000
I'll go look it up

02:26:27.000 --> 02:26:29.000
I don't remember

02:26:29.000 --> 02:26:31.000
That would have only been like two years ago

02:26:31.000 --> 02:26:33.000
That's alright

02:26:33.000 --> 02:26:35.000
This isn't going to get any better

02:26:35.000 --> 02:26:37.000
DS Master 25 or 26 or whoever you are

02:26:37.000 --> 02:26:39.000
we've got to wrap up, it's way past your bedtime

02:26:39.000 --> 02:26:41.000
young man, but any other last minute thoughts

02:26:41.000 --> 02:26:43.000
before we let you go?

02:26:43.000 --> 02:26:45.000
Beat Mania 2DX 17

02:26:45.000 --> 02:26:47.000
so PS3 is going to rock

02:26:47.000 --> 02:26:49.000
I'm importing it with a PS3

02:26:49.000 --> 02:26:51.000
that's indefinite

02:26:51.000 --> 02:26:53.000
I hope we actually see it over here

02:26:53.000 --> 02:26:55.000
It's perfect

02:26:55.000 --> 02:26:57.000
Later

02:26:57.000 --> 02:26:59.000
Wow

02:26:59.000 --> 02:27:01.000
That's like

02:27:01.000 --> 02:27:03.000
and then

02:27:03.000 --> 02:27:05.000
it got worse

02:27:05.000 --> 02:27:07.000
and then it got worse

02:27:07.000 --> 02:27:09.000
You have to admit that call is pretty epic

02:27:09.000 --> 02:27:11.000
that was pretty awesome

02:27:11.000 --> 02:27:13.000
It was cool, I kind of feel bad for a minute

02:27:13.000 --> 02:27:15.000
that's alright

02:27:15.000 --> 02:27:17.000
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?

02:27:17.000 --> 02:27:19.000
Hello, this is Ray

02:27:19.000 --> 02:27:21.000
or Ray Force

02:27:21.000 --> 02:27:23.000
whatever you go on Orange Lounge Radio

02:27:23.000 --> 02:27:25.000
What's up Ray?

02:27:25.000 --> 02:27:27.000
What's your mind?

02:27:27.000 --> 02:27:29.000
Well, this past week I managed to

02:27:29.000 --> 02:27:31.000
get my hands on a Street Fighter 4

02:27:31.000 --> 02:27:33.000
5 and 6 tournament edition

02:27:33.000 --> 02:27:35.000
it had a big stick with the real arcade parts

02:27:35.000 --> 02:27:37.000
Mhm

02:27:37.000 --> 02:27:39.000
Now what did you think?

02:27:39.000 --> 02:27:41.000
So I started

02:27:41.000 --> 02:27:43.000
I was playing mostly shooter type games

02:27:43.000 --> 02:27:45.000
like

02:27:45.000 --> 02:27:47.000
writing fires and such

02:27:47.000 --> 02:27:49.000
it takes some time getting used to it

02:27:49.000 --> 02:27:51.000
especially with the square well

02:27:51.000 --> 02:27:53.000
instead of having an octagonal well

02:27:53.000 --> 02:27:55.000
I get used to it

02:27:55.000 --> 02:27:57.000
playing a

02:27:57.000 --> 02:27:59.000
tree shooter with a stick

02:27:59.000 --> 02:28:01.000
it's really something you'd play with

02:28:01.000 --> 02:28:03.000
a patterned keyboard

02:28:03.000 --> 02:28:05.000
How expensive is this thing?

02:28:07.000 --> 02:28:09.000
I got it at $95

02:28:09.000 --> 02:28:11.000
at Fry's

02:28:11.000 --> 02:28:13.000
but it was down to $95 instead of $100

02:28:13.000 --> 02:28:15.000
like usual because it was a return

02:28:15.000 --> 02:28:17.000
stick, I guess someone didn't like it

02:28:17.000 --> 02:28:19.000
but said they returned it

02:28:19.000 --> 02:28:21.000
I guess that kind of stuff

02:28:21.000 --> 02:28:23.000
tends to go down in price though

02:28:23.000 --> 02:28:25.000
after just a little bit of time

02:28:25.000 --> 02:28:27.000
because haven't those been out a little while?

02:28:27.000 --> 02:28:29.000
Since February

02:28:29.000 --> 02:28:31.000
Yeah, they've been out for nearly a year now

02:28:31.000 --> 02:28:33.000
and I believe the prices around VR

02:28:33.000 --> 02:28:35.000
are starting to run out of them

02:28:35.000 --> 02:28:37.000
Honestly

02:28:37.000 --> 02:28:39.000
if you're to build your own, it's a lot cheaper

02:28:39.000 --> 02:28:41.000
Really? Because I actually thought about getting one of those

02:28:41.000 --> 02:28:43.000
I think we're thinking of the same

02:28:43.000 --> 02:28:45.000
device, I was thinking about getting one of those

02:28:45.000 --> 02:28:47.000
a while ago

02:28:47.000 --> 02:28:49.000
Yeah, you can basically, if you get the encoder board

02:28:49.000 --> 02:28:51.000
which, they're not that expensive

02:28:51.000 --> 02:28:53.000
the actual

02:28:53.000 --> 02:28:55.000
buttons and everything will cost anything

02:28:55.000 --> 02:28:57.000
I'm not you, I can't build my own stuff

02:28:57.000 --> 02:28:59.000
It plugs in! I mean my god

02:28:59.000 --> 02:29:01.000
It's a switch

02:29:01.000 --> 02:29:03.000
Fine, it's simple

02:29:03.000 --> 02:29:05.000
You'd be surprised

02:29:05.000 --> 02:29:07.000
Be very surprised

02:29:07.000 --> 02:29:09.000
So Ray, was it worth the money?

02:29:09.000 --> 02:29:11.000
No

02:29:11.000 --> 02:29:13.000
Was it worth the money?

02:29:13.000 --> 02:29:15.000
Definitely

02:29:15.000 --> 02:29:17.000
I also love how it's real arcade parts

02:29:17.000 --> 02:29:19.000
so if one of the buttons breaks down

02:29:19.000 --> 02:29:21.000
I can just replace it with actual arcade parts

02:29:23.000 --> 02:29:25.000
What I kind of like about what you're saying is that

02:29:25.000 --> 02:29:27.000
you're not actually using this to play Street Fighter 4

02:29:27.000 --> 02:29:29.000
but that you're using it to play other games

02:29:29.000 --> 02:29:31.000
like shooters and stuff, because I think, seriously

02:29:31.000 --> 02:29:33.000
if I were to get one of these, I'd actually use it to play Soul Calibur

02:29:35.000 --> 02:29:37.000
Well, I suck horribly at fighters

02:29:37.000 --> 02:29:39.000
I mean, I'm a snot person first

02:29:39.000 --> 02:29:41.000
and a fighting game person

02:29:41.000 --> 02:29:47.000
I'm like, way further down

02:29:47.000 --> 02:29:49.000
I don't think it's worth it

02:29:49.000 --> 02:29:51.000
Alright

02:29:51.000 --> 02:29:53.000
Well, Buddy, do you have anything else you want to talk about tonight?

02:29:53.000 --> 02:29:55.000
Any other games you've been playing lately?

02:29:55.000 --> 02:29:57.000
I'm playing Space Invaders Extreme 2

02:29:57.000 --> 02:29:59.000
but I haven't been playing it for long

02:29:59.000 --> 02:30:01.000
so I'll probably tell him about it next week

02:30:01.000 --> 02:30:03.000
Yeah, please do, I'm very curious to hear about that game

02:30:03.000 --> 02:30:05.000
because I did enjoy the first one

02:30:05.000 --> 02:30:07.000
I want to hear about what's new in the second one

02:30:07.000 --> 02:30:09.000
You know

02:30:09.000 --> 02:30:11.000
How about later when there's more time to talk

02:30:11.000 --> 02:30:15.000
I used to most of my call this time on the arcade stage

02:30:15.000 --> 02:30:17.000
so a lot of people can't be called

02:30:17.000 --> 02:30:19.000
We'll arrange something

02:30:19.000 --> 02:30:21.000
Okay

02:30:21.000 --> 02:30:23.000
Alright, take care, Buddy

02:30:23.000 --> 02:30:25.000
Hey, you're in the Bay Area, any chance we're going to see you at UmLoud?

02:30:25.000 --> 02:30:29.000
I'm not sure

02:30:29.000 --> 02:30:33.000
If on a Wednesday, I'm not sure if I'll be able to make it since on Thursdays

02:30:33.000 --> 02:30:35.000
that's class Sunday at 9am

02:30:35.000 --> 02:30:37.000
and that's in San Jose, not San Francisco

02:30:37.000 --> 02:30:39.000
Oh yeah, that's right, you're in the South Bay

02:30:39.000 --> 02:30:41.000
Well, we'll see

02:30:41.000 --> 02:30:43.000
It is a weeknight, that's tough

02:30:43.000 --> 02:30:45.000
but hopefully we'll see some of our Bay Area friends

02:30:45.000 --> 02:30:47.000
able to get up there

02:30:47.000 --> 02:30:49.000
so it's going to be a fun night

02:30:49.000 --> 02:30:51.000
Alright, Buddy, thanks for calling

02:30:51.000 --> 02:30:53.000
Alright, see you later

02:30:53.000 --> 02:30:55.000
Speaking of San Jose, we've got to get our butts back to Fonomay next year

02:30:55.000 --> 02:30:57.000
because we missed this year

02:30:57.000 --> 02:30:59.000
I had a fun time at that convention

02:30:59.000 --> 02:31:01.000
We've got to get back there

02:31:01.000 --> 02:31:03.000
Anyhow, I guess that's going to do it for the Skype line tonight

02:31:03.000 --> 02:31:05.000
Thank you for those folks that gave us a call

02:31:05.000 --> 02:31:07.000
We hope you missed your chance tonight

02:31:07.000 --> 02:31:09.000
You can always try again next week

02:31:09.000 --> 02:31:11.000
But we are going to first check in

02:31:11.000 --> 02:31:13.000
see if there's any other last minute stories

02:31:13.000 --> 02:31:15.000
and wrap up the show

02:31:15.000 --> 02:31:17.000
Just real quick, there's a new indie game that's on Xbox Live indie games

02:31:17.000 --> 02:31:19.000
called Pumpkin Shop

02:31:19.000 --> 02:31:21.000
and yes, this will be the perfect time of the year

02:31:21.000 --> 02:31:23.000
to release a pumpkin carving sim

02:31:23.000 --> 02:31:25.000
so you can do just that without the mess

02:31:25.000 --> 02:31:27.000
and have your own virtual pumpkin

02:31:27.000 --> 02:31:29.000
that no one can smash against your porch

02:31:29.000 --> 02:31:31.000
No word on how expensive that is

02:31:31.000 --> 02:31:33.000
but that is called Pumpkin Shop

02:31:33.000 --> 02:31:35.000
Sounds a little ridiculous to me

02:31:35.000 --> 02:31:37.000
It looks neat

02:31:37.000 --> 02:31:39.000
It'd be cool if you could share it with your friends

02:31:39.000 --> 02:31:41.000
If you want to carve a pumpkin, carve a pumpkin

02:31:41.000 --> 02:31:43.000
I'm surprised there's not a Facebook app to do that

02:31:43.000 --> 02:31:45.000
and then you share it with your friends

02:31:45.000 --> 02:31:47.000
so they get annoying little notices and stuff

02:31:47.000 --> 02:31:49.000
Yeah, I'm kind of surprised there isn't that too

02:31:49.000 --> 02:31:51.000
but now that you said it, there'll probably be one

02:31:51.000 --> 02:31:53.000
Is that it?

02:31:53.000 --> 02:31:55.000
It's a shame that there's not millions of dollars

02:31:55.000 --> 02:31:57.000
coming into my mailbox each day

02:31:57.000 --> 02:31:59.000
because that would be tragic

02:31:59.000 --> 02:32:01.000
I know, you can start your own game company

02:32:01.000 --> 02:32:03.000
with a pumpkin carving Facebook app

02:32:03.000 --> 02:32:05.000
release President Cat

02:32:05.000 --> 02:32:07.000
You'd be a rich man

02:32:07.000 --> 02:32:09.000
We'll see what we can do with President Cat

02:32:09.000 --> 02:32:11.000
I mean, it's just a matter of giving

02:32:11.000 --> 02:32:13.000
That sounds like a threat

02:32:13.000 --> 02:32:15.000
That's not a threat

02:32:15.000 --> 02:32:17.000
We'll just see where we can

02:32:17.000 --> 02:32:19.000
We'll figure out who we want to target

02:32:19.000 --> 02:32:21.000
to bug about releasing President Cat

02:32:21.000 --> 02:32:23.000
over here and

02:32:23.000 --> 02:32:25.000
I think access game localization

02:32:25.000 --> 02:32:27.000
I know, I was going to say, whoever's doing Choaniki

02:32:27.000 --> 02:32:29.000
I mean, really, really

02:32:29.000 --> 02:32:31.000
They

02:32:31.000 --> 02:32:33.000
What did they release?

02:32:33.000 --> 02:32:35.000
They don't release that many games a year

02:32:35.000 --> 02:32:37.000
so I think that they may have

02:32:37.000 --> 02:32:39.000
their budget might be really low

02:32:39.000 --> 02:32:41.000
I'd say both them and UFO Interactive

02:32:41.000 --> 02:32:43.000
would be good candidates

02:32:43.000 --> 02:32:45.000
to bug about

02:32:45.000 --> 02:32:47.000
releasing the game over here

02:32:47.000 --> 02:32:49.000
and then followed by maybe

02:32:49.000 --> 02:32:51.000
I'm not sure about Ignition

02:32:51.000 --> 02:32:53.000
or

02:32:53.000 --> 02:32:55.000
oh, who was the other one?

02:32:55.000 --> 02:32:57.000
Yeah, Ignition

02:32:57.000 --> 02:32:59.000
because they

02:32:59.000 --> 02:33:01.000
really only release certain types of games over here

02:33:01.000 --> 02:33:03.000
you know, really a lot of the RPGs

02:33:03.000 --> 02:33:05.000
and that kind of stuff

02:33:05.000 --> 02:33:07.000
so that wouldn't really fit with them

02:33:07.000 --> 02:33:09.000
but access game localization, man

02:33:09.000 --> 02:33:11.000
it's all sorts of weird shit

02:33:11.000 --> 02:33:13.000
Graffiti Interactive would be good too

02:33:13.000 --> 02:33:15.000
but they're really low budget

02:33:15.000 --> 02:33:17.000
and it takes forever for them to get stuff out

02:33:17.000 --> 02:33:19.000
Well, if you guys send out emails out there

02:33:19.000 --> 02:33:21.000
we definitely want to see

02:33:21.000 --> 02:33:23.000
Send your responses, the responses you get back from companies

02:33:23.000 --> 02:33:25.000
We'll post something, I'll post something

02:33:25.000 --> 02:33:27.000
in our forums for it

02:33:27.000 --> 02:33:29.000
We'll post the information of where we need to

02:33:29.000 --> 02:33:31.000
go with that

02:33:31.000 --> 02:33:33.000
You know, I love the

02:33:33.000 --> 02:33:35.000
Excuse me, I love the way people used the photo stream

02:33:35.000 --> 02:33:37.000
last week to show pictures of President and Cat

02:33:37.000 --> 02:33:39.000
and their fan art

02:33:39.000 --> 02:33:41.000
So I would like to encourage people this week

02:33:41.000 --> 02:33:43.000
You know, we're still a little bit on our President and Cat kick

02:33:43.000 --> 02:33:45.000
We'll think of a new theme maybe next week

02:33:45.000 --> 02:33:47.000
But continuing on that, I would really like to see in the photo stream

02:33:47.000 --> 02:33:49.000
and email your pics to

02:33:49.000 --> 02:33:51.000
pics at orangelondredare.com

02:33:51.000 --> 02:33:53.000
They go right up on our website when you do that

02:33:53.000 --> 02:33:55.000
So I would like to see

02:33:55.000 --> 02:33:57.000
conceptual box art

02:33:57.000 --> 02:33:59.000
for this game if released in the US

02:33:59.000 --> 02:34:01.000
That's what I'm going to challenge folks to do

02:34:01.000 --> 02:34:03.000
on the picture feed this week

02:34:03.000 --> 02:34:05.000
And I do think I will

02:34:05.000 --> 02:34:07.000
post some information about

02:34:07.000 --> 02:34:09.000
possible companies that would

02:34:09.000 --> 02:34:11.000
maybe distribute this or

02:34:11.000 --> 02:34:13.000
localize it or something

02:34:13.000 --> 02:34:15.000
because obviously it's their money

02:34:15.000 --> 02:34:17.000
that they're risking and stuff

02:34:17.000 --> 02:34:19.000
But I think maybe even as sad as petitions go

02:34:19.000 --> 02:34:21.000
because they're crap online

02:34:21.000 --> 02:34:23.000
Maybe an online petition might not

02:34:23.000 --> 02:34:25.000
hurt because at least it shows

02:34:25.000 --> 02:34:27.000
there's a few

02:34:27.000 --> 02:34:29.000
hundred people interested in getting this game

02:34:29.000 --> 02:34:31.000
over here to see what we can do

02:34:31.000 --> 02:34:33.000
It gives people focus to

02:34:33.000 --> 02:34:35.000
make their mark or something like that

02:34:35.000 --> 02:34:37.000
and we'll go from there

02:34:37.000 --> 02:34:39.000
Well if that's it for Last Minute Stories

02:34:39.000 --> 02:34:41.000
tonight, then we're going to go around and get everybody's

02:34:41.000 --> 02:34:43.000
final thoughts. DarkSakura

02:34:43.000 --> 02:34:45.000
your final thoughts tonight

02:34:45.000 --> 02:34:47.000
Loki, your final thought tonight

02:34:47.000 --> 02:34:49.000
My final thought is

02:34:49.000 --> 02:34:51.000
I have my arcade cabinet in my house and now I've got to

02:34:51.000 --> 02:34:53.000
finish it

02:34:53.000 --> 02:34:55.000
My final thought is I want chicken

02:34:55.000 --> 02:34:57.000
I'll play a loco to be exact

02:34:57.000 --> 02:34:59.000
which reminds me of this week's episode

02:34:59.000 --> 02:35:01.000
of South Park which is kind of funny

02:35:01.000 --> 02:35:03.000
Anyhow, that's going to do it for this week's episode

02:35:03.000 --> 02:35:05.000
of Orange Lawns Radio

02:35:05.000 --> 02:35:07.000
Just a word to the wise out there

02:35:07.000 --> 02:35:09.000
to those folks that are listening live

02:35:09.000 --> 02:35:11.000
We have Daylight Savings Time kicking in next week

02:35:11.000 --> 02:35:13.000
So it's Spring Forward, Fall, Back

02:35:13.000 --> 02:35:15.000
So we will be moving the clocks

02:35:15.000 --> 02:35:17.000
back an hour here

02:35:17.000 --> 02:35:19.000
to celebrate Daylight Savings Time

02:35:19.000 --> 02:35:21.000
in your country or where you are

02:35:21.000 --> 02:35:23.000
We're looking at you, Arizona

02:35:23.000 --> 02:35:25.000
It's Arizona that doesn't have it

02:35:25.000 --> 02:35:27.000
So please plan accordingly for those of you folks

02:35:27.000 --> 02:35:29.000
that don't have Daylight Savings Time

02:35:29.000 --> 02:35:31.000
I guess that was it

02:35:31.000 --> 02:35:33.000
Yeah, I get my final thought

02:35:33.000 --> 02:35:35.000
We're good to go

02:35:35.000 --> 02:35:37.000
I always like to say also if you enjoyed Orange Lawns Radio

02:35:37.000 --> 02:35:39.000
please tell two friends about the show

02:35:39.000 --> 02:35:41.000
Help spread the word

02:35:41.000 --> 02:35:43.000
because remember we have no big magazine backing us up

02:35:43.000 --> 02:35:45.000
We have no advertising dollars

02:35:45.000 --> 02:35:47.000
We rely strictly on word of mouth

02:35:47.000 --> 02:35:49.000
We do the show for free, no ads

02:35:49.000 --> 02:35:51.000
It's not even nine o'clock yet

02:35:51.000 --> 02:35:53.000
I know, it's kind of early tonight

02:35:53.000 --> 02:35:55.000
Not really, it's still been an almost three hour show

02:35:55.000 --> 02:35:57.000
Maybe two and a half

02:35:57.000 --> 02:35:59.000
But it's time to wrap it up

02:35:59.000 --> 02:36:01.000
Get on out of here

02:36:01.000 --> 02:36:03.000
Have a good night everybody, we'll see you next week

02:36:03.000 --> 02:36:05.000
We'll be back with more of Orange Lounge Radio

02:36:05.000 --> 02:36:07.000
on November 1st

02:36:07.000 --> 02:36:09.000
Can't believe it's almost the end of the year already

02:36:09.000 --> 02:36:11.000
Getting into the very very busy game season

02:36:11.000 --> 02:36:15.000
Orange Lounge Radio

02:36:41.000 --> 02:36:43.000
Right anyway

02:36:43.000 --> 02:37:11.000
See you next week
