0	3000	Orange Lounge Radio
7000	13000	With your hosts, Dark Sakura, Sky, and Roto!
14000	19000	Tonight, October 18th, 2009, playing early bootlegs get you banned from Xbox,
19000	22000	the PSP series gains heavy product placement tie-ins,
22000	26000	and the classic arcade racer returns in high dev.
26000	30000	Orange Lounge Radio
31000	35000	Well hello everybody and welcome to another edition of Orange Lounge Radio.
35000	39000	We are that radio talk show dedicated to video games,
39000	42000	video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.
42000	45000	My name is Rob Roberts and I'm here with you every week,
45000	48000	as well as the one and only Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.
49000	50000	How you doing?
51000	52000	That good, huh?
52000	56000	Will you actually be speaking tonight or just communicating in grunts?
56000	57000	Alright, fine.
57000	60000	Also say hello to the hopefully better spoken tonight, Loki.
60000	61000	Hello.
61000	62000	How you doing, Techmaster Loki?
62000	63000	I'm doing fine.
63000	64000	Awesome.
64000	67000	A little bit before the show tonight, just before we went live,
67000	69000	sadly Bobby wasn't on tonight, but you know,
69000	73000	Bobby Blackwolf needs a break too once in a while and he had other stuff going on.
73000	75000	But we were live on the feed a little early tonight,
75000	77000	and Loki was playing some more DJ Hero.
77000	78000	Yes I was.
78000	80000	So we got to hear, and you have the full version now.
80000	81000	Yes I do.
81000	82000	We got to hear some of the mixes,
82000	84000	so I'm kind of curious what our chat thought of what they got to hear.
84000	86000	Sadly, you know, we can't reproduce it for the podcast
86000	87000	because of copyright and all that,
87000	90000	but we were playing the, what was that?
90000	93000	It was Eric Pride's Tears for Fears.
93000	97000	Oh yeah, Eric Pride's Piano versus Tears for Fears Shout,
97000	101000	and then of course MC Hammer with Can't Touch This and...
101000	102000	Vanilla Ice, right?
102000	103000	Vanilla Ice Ice Ice Baby.
103000	107000	Which was sounding really epic in the beginning, but got a little...
107000	110000	It's not one of the better tracks on there,
110000	112000	so there's a lot of good tracks in there, I mean,
112000	114000	and we'll get into that later, but it's...
114000	116000	I'm not disappointed at all.
116000	117000	Well we'll get into that in just a minute,
117000	119000	I know Loki wants to talk about that during his gaming week,
119000	123000	but first I need to plug our lovely bandwidth hosts,
123000	127000	the one and only www.allgames.com, All Games Radio,
127000	130000	always helps us out by letting us steal their bandwidth every Sunday night,
130000	132000	and they are the home to a bunch of great programs,
132000	136000	not just Bobby who's usually on before us when he's not, you know, in a drumline,
136000	138000	but then as well as a host of other programs
138000	141000	such as Escapist Listening Lounge, Video Game Outsiders,
141000	143000	Electric Sisterhood, Dead Pixel Live, blah blah blah,
143000	145000	the list goes on and on, it's great.
145000	148000	All Games Radio, www.allgames.com.
148000	151000	We tape live Sunday nights at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern,
151000	154000	and if you've never listened to Orange Launch Radio live before,
154000	156000	well, why not? Sad.
156000	158000	You should come join us some Sunday,
158000	162000	and if you are hearing this on a Sunday night that happens to be October 18th,
162000	165000	then we actually are live, and you are tuned into All Games Radio,
165000	167000	and you know that we're going to start off the show, as we always do,
167000	169000	with a little bit of How Is Your Gaming Week.
169000	171000	DarkSakura, what types of video games have you been playing this week?
171000	173000	Mmm.
173000	176000	You do have to speak at some point during this radio show.
176000	177000	Okay.
177000	178000	I'm fine.
178000	179000	I play Peggle.
179000	181000	And how is Peggle?
181000	182000	Pegglerific.
182000	183000	Yeah?
183000	186000	Um, I downloaded a bunch of crap for Sims,
186000	189000	and now it's making my game kind of fart while it's loading.
189000	190000	Sorry to hear it.
190000	193000	Yeah, I accidentally started installing a bunch of cute clothes,
193000	195000	and then I found out after I was already installing them
195000	197000	that they were for Sims 2,
197000	199000	and me being a lazy-ass just didn't bother
199000	201000	because I figured the game just wouldn't recognize it.
201000	204000	So, I've been reading a lot of comics.
204000	206000	What type of comics?
206000	208000	Um, I will pull...
208000	211000	Oh, look, my game decides to start working now.
211000	213000	I'm going to build a house live on air.
213000	218000	Deadpool 900, including the epic story of Deadpool vs. Mimes.
218000	220000	We have Deadpool vs. Mimes?
220000	222000	Yes, look at the cover.
222000	224000	That's not a very fair fight, if you ask me.
224000	227000	They're mimes that are powered with psychological weapons
227000	230000	that their mymery actually causes real damage.
230000	231000	Their mymery?
231000	232000	Their mymery.
232000	233000	Mimicry.
233000	235000	No mymery. I like the word mymery.
235000	237000	Knock that miming off.
237000	238000	I've had to play with...
238000	239000	You know...
239000	241000	I've had to play with your audio a little bit, by the way.
241000	243000	If you are hearing Dark Soccer kind of fade in and out,
243000	246000	it's live radio. That kind of thing happens.
246000	247000	We adjust audio on the fly sometimes.
247000	248000	Because remember, though...
248000	249000	What?
249000	251000	A mime is a wonderful thing to waste.
251000	252000	Shut up.
252000	255000	Hey, wait. I have an idea for a new segment, though, Dark Sakura.
255000	256000	What?
256000	257000	We're gonna do a segment called
257000	260000	Dark Sakura Reviews Games Through Grunting.
260000	261000	You ready?
261000	262000	What game should I review?
262000	266000	I'm gonna name some games and you review them with a grunt.
266000	267000	Okay.
267000	268000	We'll start with something easy.
268000	270000	Sims 3.
270000	274000	Marvel Ultimate Alliance.
274000	279000	Yaris.
279000	281000	DJ Hero.
281000	282000	Alright.
282000	284000	Speaking of which, I don't know if there's anything else.
284000	287000	Loki, do you have anything you want Dark Sakura to review with a grunt?
287000	288000	No.
288000	289000	Alright.
289000	290000	I can't think of anything else.
290000	291000	There's Shadow Complex.
291000	294000	Okay, Shadow Complex.
294000	297000	Bayonetta.
297000	298000	Alright.
298000	300000	Cheater. That's not even out yet.
300000	301000	Alright.
301000	303000	It's pretty, though.
303000	306000	She's wearing her hair.
306000	309000	Loki, how was your gaming week?
309000	311000	It was good.
311000	315000	Played lots of Grand Theft Auto, Lost and Damned.
315000	318000	There's been rumors going out there, and I've seen it now,
318000	321000	that people have found a way around the patch so they can re-enable mods again.
321000	323000	And I've been trying to figure out how to do that.
323000	328000	And I'm close, but what I thought I needed to change actually freezes the game up.
328000	333000	So, not quite there yet, but I'm on the path to getting it done.
333000	337000	And I've obviously been playing lots of DJ Hero.
337000	341000	I played it for a few hours today and yesterday.
341000	345000	Most of the game starts off locked when most of the tracks you can play.
345000	348000	So I've actually unlocked almost everything in the game so far.
348000	350000	I mean, that's how much I've been playing it.
350000	354000	And if you played it at, say, a Best Buy or GameStop or something like that
354000	358000	and thought it was too easy, trust me, those songs are nothing
358000	360000	compared to the stuff that's in the game.
360000	362000	It's fucking hard even on medium.
362000	364000	That's what I've been playing it on.
364000	367000	I mean, you bump it up to Expert or something like that.
367000	369000	It's just insane.
369000	372000	So I wouldn't be worried by that.
372000	375000	But yeah, nothing like BeatMania, obviously.
375000	377000	But great track lists.
377000	380000	I mean, there's not really any songs I haven't liked in the game.
380000	383000	I mean, there's some that have been okay, but there's none that I really hate.
383000	385000	I mean, it's just overall good.
385000	388000	I like playing all of them.
388000	390000	And for the live folks, you're going to spin some more songs.
390000	392000	Oh yeah, we'll play more songs during the break.
392000	394000	Awesome.
394000	397000	Anything else, or is this DJ Hero or DG Hero all week long?
397000	398000	That's what I've been doing.
398000	399000	All right, sounds good.
399000	400000	My Gaming Week.
400000	402000	Sadly, I don't have a lot of new games, really.
402000	404000	There's only one new game I can think of to review,
404000	406000	and it's actually something I've been playing a couple weeks.
406000	408000	I just have yet to mention it on the show.
408000	412000	It's a PlayStation Network game, and it's called Digger.
412000	416000	And I guess it's based off an old Apple IIe game or something.
416000	418000	I had never played the original game.
418000	422000	It's kind of like if Dig Dug met Mr. Doom,
422000	427000	met Pac-Man, met a lot of other classic 80s games,
427000	429000	kind of all in one little hodgepodge of a game.
429000	431000	You can play the game in classic mode,
431000	435000	which is why I can kind of tell that this game was either originally on Apple II
435000	437000	or the old school CGA,
437000	440000	because that's the kind of graphics it has, the CGA graphics in classic mode.
440000	443000	But you don't download games on PlayStation Network
443000	445000	to play them in four colors now, do you?
445000	447000	Obviously, the game's been fleshed out with a whole new high def mode,
447000	449000	and pretty crisp graphics.
449000	453000	So if you're into retro gaming, I think you'll kind of like this,
453000	455000	especially because it combines the elements of all these old games.
455000	459000	I like a lot of the retro games, though.
459000	462000	It can get a little repetitive, so be warned.
462000	464000	But they do try to throw in some things to make it interesting,
464000	468000	like co-op survival and co-op collaborative mode,
468000	470000	and a whole crap ton of levels.
470000	474000	My only complaint is that it was hard for me to kind of pick up and go with the game.
474000	478000	There's no tutorial or mode that teaches you how to play the game.
478000	481000	I guess they figure a lot of people are going to want to download this
481000	483000	because of the retro vibe going on,
483000	486000	but that's a lot harder to do with a game like Digger
486000	488000	than, say, a game like Pac-Man.
488000	490000	I don't know, because everybody fucking knows Pac-Man.
490000	494000	I had never heard of Digger until I decided to download this game,
494000	497000	and I was like, oh, retro gaming classic, maybe I'll like it.
497000	500000	Unfortunately, there's no demo out there for it, so I took a risk.
500000	504000	But not bad. I'm not depressed with the money I spent,
504000	508000	but I don't think it's a wow, OMG, run out and buy it right now type game either.
508000	510000	I think if you like the old retro classics,
510000	514000	you like your 80s PC games, you'll get a kick out of this.
514000	517000	But maybe you'll find out faster than I did
517000	519000	that there's actually a fire button,
519000	521000	and you can actually shoot the oncoming enemies
521000	524000	that makes the game a little easier when you feel a little overwhelmed,
524000	525000	because I had no idea.
525000	528000	There's no tutorial or nothing to kind of get you going with the game.
528000	530000	So that's my one little piece of feedback for it.
530000	535000	Otherwise, OMG, World of Warcraft, LOL, WTFBBQ.
535000	537000	I was looking for donations, by the way.
537000	538000	Are you?
538000	539000	Yeah.
539000	540000	Everybody's looking for donations on the show.
540000	542000	Well, no, I mean, because I can't.
542000	543000	I know, I know.
543000	547000	But I am up to level 52 on my paladin.
547000	549000	I just hit 52 before the show tonight,
549000	553000	which isn't bad considering I think she rolled on September 3rd or 4th,
553000	555000	so I haven't been playing that long,
555000	557000	and I don't have triple XP or anything like that,
557000	559000	so I'm happy.
559000	562000	So that's it for my gaming week pretty much.
562000	564000	Otherwise, the same type of stuff I already talked about last week,
564000	567000	like Demon's Souls and Katamari Forever and all that fun stuff.
567000	569000	So now that we've talked about our gaming weeks,
569000	572000	let's get into some housekeeping real quick,
572000	574000	but actually not a lot for that segment either.
574000	579000	So I'm just going to plug our Twitter at www.Twitter.com slash O-L-R,
579000	581000	and of course we also have our Facebook community.
581000	582000	Just search for O-L Army.
582000	585000	By the way, we're going to create an actual page on there too.
585000	587000	I can't remember if I mentioned this last week or not.
587000	589000	I was going to work on that more this week,
589000	591000	but I got sidetracked leveling a paladin,
591000	593000	so I'm hopefully going to get that done.
593000	597000	Actually, we had a lot of shows that we were behind on the feed too.
597000	599000	Three shows went up this week on the podcast feed,
599000	601000	so you can't say I didn't do anything for O-L-R.
601000	604000	I got that just about caught up.
604000	607000	And yeah, so look for that on Facebook,
607000	610000	and we have a MySpace if anyone actually uses that anymore.
610000	612000	Does anyone use MySpace anymore? I don't think so.
612000	618000	The last thing I did on MySpace was look at my art history teacher's blog.
618000	620000	The last thing I did on MySpace was block spammers.
620000	622000	Nellie looked at MySpace the other day and she's like,
622000	624000	wow, it looks like Facebook now.
624000	628000	They did change some stuff on there to try and make it more Facebook-y, I guess,
628000	630000	but I don't like it anymore.
630000	631000	Facebook did something that makes me happy.
631000	632000	What's that?
632000	635000	I can now block everything I don't freaking want to see.
635000	638000	I can keep from getting this stupid sorority life invites.
638000	640000	They've had that for months.
640000	643000	But they haven't had it in an easy-to-access place.
643000	645000	You had to go into your profile and everything,
645000	648000	and I would set it all up through my profile and I'd still get all the shit.
648000	650000	Because the apps get smart and they work around them.
650000	653000	They exploit every little thing Facebook will let you do.
653000	656000	Now I can just hide and I don't ever have to see it again.
656000	657000	Yay.
657000	659000	All right, that's what Twitter needs, by the way.
659000	661000	O-M-G, does Twitter need a hide button?
661000	663000	Twitter needs a filter.
663000	666000	All right. Anyhow, let's move on.
666000	669000	Let's talk less ranting on social networking and more gaming news.
669000	671000	We'll start off tonight.
671000	673000	The wonderful Loki is going to start us off tonight.
673000	676000	Yes, Nintendo has partnered up with Capcom
676000	679000	and 53 other video game publishers in Japan
679000	683000	to file suit against four resellers of the popular R4 flash cartridge.
683000	686000	You know, the one that modded the pirate stuff.
686000	692000	Apparently, though, in Tokyo court it banned the sale of the devices.
692000	697000	However, these four retailers are kind of ignoring that.
697000	702000	So there's a new lawsuit now that finally stopped these guys from selling it.
702000	706000	I mean, it's kind of interesting if you think about it
706000	711000	because they've been making threats about this stuff for a while now.
711000	714000	And I kind of find it funny that they're really only targeting the R4
714000	717000	because that is the most widely known backup device.
717000	720000	But there's tons of them out there.
720000	725000	I mean, the R4, I don't even think it's being used as much nowadays
725000	727000	as some of these other ones.
727000	728000	I don't know.
728000	730000	But I guess it's a start
730000	734000	because I know piracy really eats into the DS sales.
734000	736000	Especially overseas, right?
736000	738000	They have more of a problem with this overseas than they do here, right?
738000	740000	Definitely.
740000	742000	Are you surprised by this move?
742000	746000	I mean, I can't think of anything quite like this that I've heard of recently.
746000	747000	Well, it makes sense.
747000	751000	I mean, the court already banned the sales of this stuff.
751000	753000	They went ahead and ignored the law.
753000	756000	I guess they're going to have a lawsuit put against them.
756000	757000	I don't know.
757000	759000	It's not surprising, I guess.
759000	760000	Yeah.
760000	762000	Okay.
762000	766000	Do you think there's a legitimate purpose for someone having an R4
766000	768000	or is this just straight-up piracy?
768000	771000	I mean, is there any type of way that they could come into court and say,
771000	774000	oh, well, this R4 has a legitimate purpose
774000	777000	or is it just 100% piracy?
777000	780000	It does have a legitimate purpose as far as enabling homebrew,
780000	785000	but once again, though, it's kind of reverse engineering the DS
785000	789000	sort of to make it work, that kind of stuff.
789000	794000	So yeah, it might allow for homebrew stuff,
794000	799000	but any of the homebrew enabling patches, mods, whatever out there so far
799000	804000	have been pretty much stomped out by any game hardware manufacturer.
804000	807000	I mean, look at Sony with the PSP firmwares.
807000	809000	Yeah, it enables homebrew, but people use the pirate stuff,
809000	811000	so they've been stomping that out.
811000	813000	Look at the Wii, the homebrew channel.
813000	817000	I mean, also used for homebrew, but also used for piracy.
817000	820000	They've tried to stomp that out, and then now with the DS,
820000	825000	with the flash cards, they're trying, and they keep making changes to it.
825000	827000	It's hard, though, with the Wii.
827000	830000	Well, I should say not even the Wii, but the DS,
830000	833000	not so much with the DSi now because I think you can patch that
833000	836000	with firmware upgrades, but with the DS,
836000	841000	so you can't add any firmware upgrades to it, so you're pretty much stuck.
841000	845000	If someone gets one of those, maybe later on some of the games
845000	848000	will patch it so that you can't play those ROMs or whatever
848000	852000	on your R4 device, but the ones that are already made out there,
852000	854000	there's nothing they can do about it because they can't patch it.
854000	856000	I've got a wild question for you.
856000	859000	Isn't homebrew piracy in a way?
859000	862000	I mean, any homebrew that's cooked up,
862000	866000	because aren't you supposed to buy a very expensive kit from Nintendo
866000	869000	or Sony or whoever it is to develop for the system?
869000	870000	No.
870000	872000	Are you supposed to buy these very expensive kits to help you develop?
872000	874000	If you were to put something out in market,
874000	876000	then maybe that wouldn't necessarily be piracy,
876000	878000	but it would be unauthorized,
878000	881000	because of all the stipulations that they have,
881000	883000	the testing process that has to go through,
883000	885000	and development kits and whatnot.
885000	890000	Then, yeah, to be in market, you'd have to be an authorized developer,
890000	892000	but this isn't really in market.
892000	894000	This is just kind of crap that they're throwing on there.
894000	897000	But it encourages people to hack their stuff, right?
897000	899000	People are going to hack it no matter what,
899000	901000	whether the carts are out there or something else.
901000	903000	I mean, they'll find a way around it.
903000	905000	All right.
905000	908000	Well, I'm going to our chat room at chat.orangelandradio.com,
908000	911000	and it looks like there's just other devices out there.
911000	913000	Azure Edge says, I have Ace Card 2.
913000	916000	I've never heard of this, but I guess that's another similar device?
916000	918000	Yeah, there's the Ace Card.
918000	921000	There's Cyclo DS, Evolution.
921000	925000	They've also got the M3.
925000	929000	I think the D6 or something like that.
929000	931000	So why are we just hearing about the R4 then?
931000	935000	Because it's the popular one, I guess.
935000	937000	It's just like, you know, like Napster.
937000	940000	Remember, there was Napster and a lot of other file-sharing services,
940000	942000	but everyone went after Napster because...
942000	945000	Oh, yeah, LimeWire, Virus Heaven. I remember that one.
945000	948000	Well, I'm just saying that there were other services out there,
948000	950000	but, you know, they're going to go after them.
950000	951000	Just like Pirate Bay.
951000	954000	They're going after Pirate Bay because that's the most...
954000	957000	I guess they're making an example out of them or something like that.
957000	962000	Yeah, but they really can't do anything about Pirate Bay
962000	965000	unless they get international law changed or...
965000	967000	Didn't Pirate Bay have to stop?
967000	968000	Didn't something happen with that?
968000	970000	I mean, I don't know. I don't use Pirate Bay.
970000	972000	It did, but it's still up.
972000	974000	So I don't really know.
974000	976000	I guess it didn't work very well.
976000	977000	Going to our chat again, Tiger Claw says,
977000	980000	Homebrew is also used to create applications that can be useful
980000	984000	for non-gaming purposes, like listening to internet radio and such.
984000	986000	Hey, I guess that would be useful, wouldn't it?
986000	988000	For programs like this.
988000	991000	Well, it's also the kind of, you know,
991000	995000	put the applications and features that you want on a certain console.
995000	999000	It's a way to build those in where, you know,
999000	1001000	said company is not putting them in.
1001000	1005000	And actually some companies, like Sony, have learned from the Homebrew community
1005000	1008000	and have seen what they've put in there
1008000	1011000	and have added that support in later on.
1011000	1016000	Sometimes little things kind of get endorsed, too.
1016000	1018000	I seem to remember, you know, speaking of,
1018000	1021000	because Tiger Claw's comment kind of made me think of internet radio on the Wii,
1021000	1024000	there was a program a while back, and I can't remember the name of it,
1024000	1026000	and I don't even know if it's still developed,
1026000	1030000	but it was a program that was supposed to let you get podcasts on your Wii,
1030000	1032000	like it downloaded them to some program,
1032000	1034000	or sorry, not the Wii, the Xbox 360.
1034000	1036000	You could get podcasts on the 360,
1036000	1037000	and I remember it was really controversial
1037000	1039000	because all the podcasts that were in it by default,
1039000	1042000	it was downloading like the last five episodes all at once.
1042000	1044000	Maybe somebody in chat can remember the name of this.
1044000	1048000	Because I remember we were listed in a future version of it
1048000	1050000	after that bug was taken out,
1050000	1052000	but the reason why I bring it up is that I seem to remember
1052000	1055000	like Major Nelson mentioned it on his blog or something,
1055000	1058000	and that's why the thing got so popular so fast,
1058000	1061000	and it just screwed the bandwidth of all these sites.
1061000	1064000	I remember Gamer Andy was pissed about it.
1064000	1066000	Tiger Claw says it's TV or City,
1066000	1068000	but that's actually not the one I'm thinking of.
1068000	1071000	I think that lets you do podcasts also,
1071000	1073000	but that's not the same one I'm thinking of.
1073000	1075000	That's what you use for streaming video.
1075000	1076000	Yeah.
1076000	1078000	But there was another program, and I can't remember the name,
1078000	1079000	but it was a couple of years ago.
1079000	1080000	I don't think it's developed anymore.
1080000	1083000	If it is, it's not popular, sadly.
1083000	1084000	I don't know.
1084000	1087000	But anyhow, maybe somebody else in chat will come up with that later.
1087000	1090000	Anyhow, moving on to another new story,
1090000	1092000	something completely different.
1092000	1094000	Let's talk Pokemans.
1094000	1096000	OMG Pokemans.
1096000	1097000	Anyhow, no.
1097000	1098000	Let me show you them.
1098000	1100000	There is a new Pokemon game coming out.
1100000	1103000	It is PokePark Wii, Pikachu's Big Adventure.
1103000	1105000	Nintendo officially unveiled the game this week,
1105000	1107000	meaning screenshots and all that fun stuff.
1107000	1109000	It is coming out in Japan on December 5th.
1109000	1111000	It'll set you back 4,800 yen.
1111000	1116000	That would be $53 in exchange rates.
1116000	1122000	Sadly, though, it's not really a Pokemon Game Boy game on the Wii,
1122000	1125000	like people have been wanting, oh, I don't know, forever.
1125000	1129000	Instead, it's a game where you are, of course, Pikachu,
1129000	1131000	because, you know, one of the Pokemon is nearly as famous,
1131000	1133000	and you're in, like, a theme park,
1133000	1137000	and you tag, battle, and participate in quiz minigames.
1137000	1138000	Oh, joy.
1138000	1141000	It's another minigame collection on the Nintendo Wii.
1141000	1144000	Only this time, it has Pokemon.
1144000	1147000	But my Pokemans, let me show you them.
1147000	1150000	Also, Pikachu interacts with new friends.
1150000	1154000	There's also a camera mode to let you photograph the Pokemon you meet.
1154000	1158000	I guess kind of tipping the hat to Pokemon Snap, which was kind of awesome.
1158000	1161000	But no words about Mudkips. Sorry, guys.
1161000	1163000	But Pokemans, Rob.
1163000	1168000	I know it's Pokemans, but it's not like the Game Boy Pokemon games.
1168000	1170000	Don't care, Pokemans. It'll sell.
1170000	1172000	Nintendo prints money.
1172000	1176000	I guess so, but I'm just like, yay, another minigame collection on the Wii.
1176000	1179000	Although, to be fair, they're talking about, you know, tagging and battling
1179000	1180000	and all this other stuff, too.
1180000	1183000	And I shouldn't judge a game before I play it,
1183000	1186000	but, you know, you're not giving me a lot to go off of here.
1186000	1188000	It's not like the Wii has demos, either,
1188000	1191000	and I'm not going to spend 40 bucks or 50 bucks on a game
1191000	1193000	just to find out it's another crappy minigame collection.
1193000	1196000	But, but, but, Rob. Pokemans.
1196000	1199000	DarkTatsuya in chat says Pokemon Snap needs a sequel.
1199000	1202000	It sort of does, and maybe that's what they're trying to allude to with this,
1202000	1205000	but I wouldn't say that this is a sequel by any means.
1205000	1206000	Now, I'm looking at screenshots,
1206000	1209000	and here's one where it looks like Pikachu's kind of fighting Charizard
1209000	1213000	with some timer on the screen doing battle, so I don't, maybe,
1213000	1215000	maybe there's something cool in there,
1215000	1220000	but it's not the role-playing Pokemon a lot of you guys have come to know and love,
1220000	1224000	which I think is the game people really want on the Wii. So.
1224000	1227000	That's, that's sad and a shame and a travesty.
1227000	1228000	It is.
1228000	1230000	It is what else is sad and a shame and a travesty.
1230000	1231000	What?
1231000	1232000	What Sega's doing.
1232000	1233000	What is Sega doing?
1233000	1235000	Bringing back a piece of my tortured past.
1235000	1236000	Why?
1236000	1238000	Into full HD life.
1238000	1241000	I do not understand. Please elaborate.
1241000	1246000	Um, I don't ever, if I've ever told you about my nightmares of Daytona USA.
1246000	1249000	Even if you have, it's probably been years, so tell them again.
1249000	1255000	I used to, when I worked for my Namco arcade, we had a four-person Daytona USA,
1255000	1257000	and it would, it would follow me. I would hear,
1257000	1260000	Daytona!
1260000	1263000	Or, Rolling Start!
1263000	1265000	I don't know, like, ugh!
1265000	1266000	What about Daytona?
1266000	1267000	That too.
1267000	1271000	So, um, but it's coming back. It is coming back.
1271000	1275000	Oh, is it ever, as Sega Racing Classic.
1275000	1278000	Sega Racing!
1278000	1284000	And, um, it's gonna be on, uh, the ring-wide, um, arcade hardware,
1284000	1292000	and, uh, it's being called Sega Racing Classic because they don't have the rights to the Daytona name anymore.
1292000	1294000	Oh, well that makes sense, I guess.
1294000	1298000	So I guess we're, we're not gonna get the Daytona.
1298000	1301000	So, but you know what I want?
1301000	1307000	Is I want cameos by, um, Pepsiman, and by, um, Sega Tasanchiro.
1307000	1310000	That would make me happy.
1310000	1314000	Sega always has the most interesting product placement in their games,
1314000	1316000	because I think about Crazy Taxi.
1316000	1318000	I also want to race as the horse in the game.
1318000	1321000	And, I want a little mini-game in there where you can fight,
1321000	1324000	make the cars fight each other like Fighter's Megamix.
1324000	1326000	Uh, xlinc in chat says,
1326000	1328000	I work at an arcade and I hated that song.
1328000	1331000	Yes! See, anyone who has worked in an arcade,
1331000	1334000	where the attract mode is turned sufficiently loud enough,
1334000	1336000	knows my pain.
1336000	1338000	Knows my pain.
1338000	1341000	I'd have nightmares, I'm not kidding, I would have nightmares.
1341000	1342000	Nightmares.
1342000	1343000	Nice.
1343000	1346000	No it's not! It's awful!
1346000	1351000	How would you like to be in the middle of dreaming about,
1351000	1354000	you know, so-and-so gorgeous person, and then hear,
1354000	1357000	DAH! Oh god! Knock it off!
1357000	1361000	Maybe I don't understand because I've never played this Daytona game.
1361000	1363000	I just somehow missed it, I guess.
1363000	1369000	I left Daytona USA at the Luxor the first time I went to Las Vegas,
1369000	1371000	when it first, when the game first came out,
1371000	1375000	and had like the eight person big rallies set up.
1375000	1377000	I thought it was cool then,
1377000	1379000	that's the last time I ever thought that game was cool.
1379000	1381000	Wait, don't they have this at Dave & Buster's?
1381000	1383000	Uh, they have something similar.
1383000	1385000	I think they have NASCAR, it's like similar to that.
1385000	1389000	Maybe I played it years ago when they had it at Dave & Buster's, I think.
1389000	1394000	It was one of those games that they would have linked like 80,000 units.
1394000	1398000	Rob, you just need to go on YouTube and look up Daytona Rolling Start.
1398000	1400000	Sure, I'd be happy to.
1400000	1403000	It's fantastic radio, and this is how everyone would know-
1403000	1405000	There you go, Tiger Claw linked the theme in the chat room.
1405000	1407000	Yeah.
1410000	1414000	Dude, Tiger Claw is like faster at researching stuff than I am.
1414000	1416000	I've already been on it.
1416000	1419000	I'm saying that because there's like a 45 second delay.
1426000	1428000	I have played this game.
1428000	1429000	Yes, you have.
1429000	1430000	Yes, I have.
1430000	1435000	Now that I'm not hearing your horrible karaoke rendition of it, I recognize it.
1435000	1437000	You need to find the Rolling Start one,
1437000	1440000	because that's the one that I still hear in my sleep.
1441000	1443000	How can you not like this song?
1443000	1445000	It's totally not repetitive.
1445000	1447000	Because I have something called taste.
1448000	1451000	This almost sounds like it could be like an 80s cartoon theme, you know?
1451000	1452000	That'd be awesome.
1458000	1461000	Someone should totally make that as their cell phone ringtone, that'd be awesome.
1461000	1464000	I'm gonna make that the ringtone for whenever Jamie calls on my phone.
1466000	1469000	Hey, I've already made a bunch of iPhone ringtones now.
1469000	1474000	I made the Burning Rangers one, and that's about as far as I'll go into the realm of Sega.
1474000	1476000	Hey, Jamie, I've got a joke for you.
1477000	1478000	It's gonna end...
1478000	1482000	The joke is gonna be when I kick your ass so hard your teeth will feel my foot.
1482000	1483000	Dark Sakura.
1484000	1485000	Knock knock.
1486000	1487000	What?
1493000	1494000	What?
1494000	1496000	What?
1497000	1498000	Shut up.
1499000	1501000	I will play it again. I will fucking play it again.
1501000	1503000	I will kick you in the face.
1505000	1506000	You know what your ringtone is on my phone, by the way?
1506000	1507000	What?
1509000	1511000	I wanna guess. Is it?
1515000	1516000	No? No?
1520000	1522000	Just let me borrow that phone.
1522000	1523000	So I gave you something more annoying.
1523000	1524000	Alright.
1524000	1527000	I don't know what it is with this show tonight. I'm just...
1528000	1529000	It's called Jamie Has a Headache.
1529000	1530000	I feel sorry.
1530000	1532000	Oh, and Tigerclaw linked the rolling start, by the way.
1532000	1533000	Awesome.
1534000	1537000	That one, actually, I do like that one okay.
1537000	1538000	Just cause I think it's kinda neat.
1538000	1540000	I realize this game is like years and years old.
1543000	1545000	This is the worst soundtrack in history.
1545000	1547000	I love this soundtrack. What are you talking about?
1547000	1552000	It's more of a song you need to play the game to.
1556000	1558000	I actually like this music.
1563000	1567000	Xlinc in chat says, I'll fly over there and both of them in the face.
1567000	1570000	Except he left out, like, there's a word missing there, I think.
1570000	1571000	So...
1572000	1574000	You know what you can do in the face?
1574000	1576000	Do, do, do, do, do, do-do-d Features
1575000	1578000	Rob, you need to cleanse the pallet.
1580000	1581000	Let's move on.
1581000	1583000	Copy, save us.
1583000	1587000	Let's get into some release dates, perhaps that will end the Daytona chat.
1587000	1588000	Never. It will never end that chat.
1588000	1595000	So coming out of this week is actually a pretty good line up of stuff.
1595000	1600000	Starting off we've got Borderlands, which is making its way out
1600000	1609720	Xbox 360. Did Rob mess up? No, just go ahead. I totally like skipped like three
1609720	1612880	stories in the show, but that's okay. Just do release dates now, we'll go back to it.
1612880	1622240	Alright, anyways. Stop messing with my head, Rob! I got too distracted by Daytona, I'm sorry. But it's
1622240	1628440	good music to think too. Alright, so yeah, as I said, Borderlands coming out this
1628440	1633040	week. PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, pretty awesome looking, so definitely check that
1633040	1646680	out. If you're into the football, or soccer as we call it in the US, FIFA Soccer 2010 will be coming out on DS, PSP, Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, PlayStation 2, and Wii.
1646680	1653760	Smackdown vs. Brawl 2010 also coming out this week on pretty much everything.
1653760	1666360	Space Invaders Extreme 2 making its way out on DS, finally. It looks like the Wii version of NBA 2K10 was delayed to this week, so that'll be coming out as well.
1666360	1672640	Jillian Michaels Fitness Ultimatum 2010 on DS. Yippee, I know, I'm excited.
1672640	1682560	Madagascar Carts on the Wii, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360, DS, and PSP. And then with the Wii, of course, they also have a version with
1682560	1690640	a wheel, because god damn it, no one can pretend that the Wii remote is a steering wheel without a plastic piece of crap that's got attached to it.
1690640	1697240	Marvel Superhero Squad coming out on PlayStation 2, Wii, and DS. If you like your
1697240	1705520	Marvel Ultimate Alliance Super Chibi. Tropico 3 coming out on PC. Charm Girls Club,
1705520	1715160	Perfect Prom coming out on DS. And yes, EA has a lot more to go with that as well. They have a few other Charm Girls games.
1715160	1722760	Charm Girls Club Pajama Party on the Wii. Ooh, exciting. Charm Girls Club Fashion Mall on DS.
1722760	1734800	And there was something with the prom, I know. Oh, Fashion Show, yes. And to go along with that, if you're not in the Charm Girls Club, maybe
1734800	1743800	Littlest Pet Shop, because they're whoring that out this week as well. Littlest Pet Shop City Friends on DS this week. Littlest Pet Shop Friends on the Wii.
1743800	1754400	Littlest Pet Shop Country Friends on DS. And I'm sure there's one other one, but I don't really care. What a bunch of crap. Yes, exactly.
1754400	1770240	It's not coming out this week, but Cookie Mama 3 and Shop and Chop is coming out on DS. Oh, there's a game for Jamie. You know, it'd be better if it was Cookie Mama 3
1770240	1780880	Chop Shop, but you know, opportunity missed. Just in time for Halloween, too. Cookie Mama goes insane. You know, I have to tell you guys something. Before the show tonight,
1780880	1788120	Dark Soccer, you know, we were all running late tonight. If the show seems off tonight, it is. Dark Soccer, I think, is getting sick, which means
1788120	1797800	Loki and I are going to be sick. I've had the plague. Great. Cool, I get to play DJ Hero. Loki is not cool for me. I've got so much crap going on at work.
1797800	1806600	Loki got here like five minutes before the show started tonight, and it was going to get chicken. And I overslept, so I got here way later than I usually do.
1806600	1815880	If Bobby was going to do a call tonight, we would have been screwed. We would have been ready. But here's the thing. Dark Soccer, she runs in here like a couple of minutes
1815880	1826760	before the show starts, and she goes, dude, I've got these grapes that are like eyeballs. They're so big. They are. They're the size of eyeballs. They're meat and grapes.
1826760	1835400	Well, is your mic on? No, I turned it off because you said I was typing too loud. That's right. Well, so you had these grapes that were the size of eyeballs, and it made me
1835400	1843480	think how, like, you remember when you'd go to those haunted houses when you were younger? They'd put frozen grapes in a bowl and tell you it was a bowl full of eyeballs?
1843480	1851360	Yeah. It just made me think of that. And then you mentioned Cooking Mama, and I think it's just in time for Halloween. What if Cooking Mama went crazy and it was a game like
1851360	1859720	Splatterhouse? That would be amazing. Or as actdeft in chat says, Cooking Mama, chop till you drop. A game like Splatterhouse? You mean delayed indefinitely? Okay, how about
1859720	1883720	Cooking Mama meets Dead Rising? That could work. Cooking Mama, Zombie Edition. Don't worry, Mama will braise. Ah, Cooking Mama as the cleaner. Don't worry, Mama will fix it. Or as darktids3 in chat says, Cooking Mama, rolling star.
1883720	1893720	Oh, that's going to be the joke all night. Other games coming out this week. Astro Boy, tying in with the new animated movie, coming out on Wii, PlayStation 2, DS, and PSP.
1893720	1916720	Secret Saturdays, Beasts of the Fifth Sun, coming out on Wii, PlayStation 2, DS. My Tran Wars on PSP. iCarly on DS and Wii. God, it's just pitiful. Mountain Sports on the Wii, yet another winter themed sports minigame collection.
1916720	1936720	Imagine Fashion Designer World Tour on DS. Crap, crap, and more crap. Is there anything interesting? Bakugan on PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Wii, and DS. And I'm sure there's something I'm missing here. Good stuff.
1936720	1946720	Good stuff. Alien Monster Bowling League? No, no, that's not good. It's on the Wii. No, Your Mom the Game, I'm Sorry, is not coming out this week. It's too bad.
1946720	1960720	She got delayed. She got delayed, yes. Lips, number one hit on Xbox 360? No? If it doesn't have that Rolling Start song, I don't want it.
1960720	1978720	Maybe it does. The worst title for a game, but they had to do it. Diner Dash, Flow on the Go, for DS. No, that's wrong. So wrong. The joke's right itself, I don't have to say anything.
1978720	1991720	Medieval Games on the Wii for all your Ren Faire fans. Grand Theft Auto Chinatown Wars coming to the PSP this week, which looks pretty cool. Dragon Ball Revenge of King Piccolo on the Wii. Lots of stuff this week.
1991720	2012720	Motorstorm Arctic Edge finally coming out on PlayStation 2, and Nostalgia on DS. That actually looks pretty sweet. Star Wars The Force Unleashed Ultimate Sith Edition on PC. And finally, World of the Zoo on the Wii.
2012720	2026720	Finally. Let's see, I wanted to actually read something from chat here that was from Psycoon saying, Orange Lounge is one big tangent today. Yes, it is. And I'm going to start another one here.
2026720	2034720	Because speaking of release dates, going to last week's releases, we had a huge game come out this week that nobody mentioned during their gaming weeks. Uncharted 2.
2034720	2050720	I, anywhere I look, I can't stop hearing about this game and how fucking amazing it's supposed to be. Like, you know, now keep in mind, I don't usually play a lot of the platformy Tomb Raider type of games, which I hear Uncharted 2 kind of is.
2050720	2066720	So I haven't really been paying attention. But now, as I will hear about how awesome this game is non-stop and how people are already calling it Game of the Year, I kind of feel like I need to play it. So I got to turn to Loki, who's talked about this game a little more on the show than I have.
2066720	2073720	What have you heard about this game? You didn't mention it either, but I seriously have not heard a single thing bad about it. Like, not one.
2073720	2080720	I don't know. It got good reviews. I'm not buying it.
2080720	2081720	Why not?
2081720	2083720	Because I don't want to buy it.
2083720	2086720	Is it one of those things where it's like, oh well, you're too cool for schools?
2086720	2096720	No, no, no. It's not even that. It's an action game. Not even so much like Tomb Raider. I mean, the comparisons of the first game were kind of like, oh, it's Tomb Raider the guy.
2096720	2107720	Not so much now. I mean, it's more of just an action game. It's a very cinematic action game. I just don't have time for it. And yeah, I can see why they're calling it Game of the Year. It's practically the only game coming from Sony this fall.
2107720	2121720	So it is the Game of the Year. I mean, they did have games in the spring, but for argument's sake, we're going to ignore those. But I don't know. It's good. I mean, don't get me wrong. Game of the Year? Probably not.
2121720	2131720	Kind of some polarizing stuff in chat. Psycoon says, if I got a free copy, I would totally play it. That's a good point. Games are 60 bucks. But again, I haven't heard a negative thing about this game. It's probably worth it.
2131720	2141720	And HungryMrKrunk says, why aren't you going to buy it? What? Seriously? What? Daytona?
2141720	2153720	I mean, there are a lot of people that probably think you're crazy for what you just said. I at least want to rent it and see if I like it and get us into it as everyone else does. So I apologize I didn't play it for this week.
2153720	2158720	I'm not buying Modern Warfare 2 either. Ooh, I'm crazy.
2158720	2163720	And GameGuru says, Game of the Year for Sony fanboy maybes. Ooh, yikes.
2163720	2177720	Don't get me wrong. It is probably going to be the best Playstation 3 game other than Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 that comes out this year. But that's about it. Best Sony made game this year? Yes.
2177720	2195720	I'll probably play it at some point. I can never resist peer pressure. Okay, anyway, back to release dates. Sorry. Going to Japan and looking at the Japanese release dates. FIFA Soccer 10 World Class Soccer comes out in Japan as well as Forza Motorsport 3 gets its run in Japan. Those both coming out on the 22nd of October.
2195720	2210720	Moving on over to, of course, the Playstation 3. FIFA Soccer 10 also comes out over there. That's really the only major release in Japan this week on the PS3. And moving on over to the Nintendo Wii, another port of FIFA 10 World Class Soccer.
2210720	2228720	There's some other games there as well, including Sukiban Satcho Reina Wii comes out on the Wii. And I like this because the box art is like this hot pink box art. And it's just kittens all over it. And it looks like it's like a lolcat game. Like I'm not even kidding.
2228720	2244720	Oh my god. I shit you not. It's Keyboard Cat. There's a scene with a cat playing the piano. It's Keyboard Cat and Lolcat like in a game for the Wii. That is Game of the Year right there. I'm sorry. Fuck Uncharted. Fuck it. This is the Game of the Year right here.
2244720	2269720	Why don't they release this crap over here? D3, come on. If there is a game that you need to localize for the US, it is this game. They're dancing with kittens and oh my god is that cat shooting a laser. Oh my god. This is it right here. Again, I'm going to say this name again.
2269720	2290720	I'm going to order that game. It is Sukiban Satcho Reina Wii. Question for you Rob. And this sort of ties in with that. Why don't we move back to the old studio again? I don't know. Because we should. Why? Because I'll get that game and then we can do it on Justin TV. Oh maybe at some point.
2290720	2306720	I can get that set up here. We just need the camera. I can get the camera. That's easy. We can do it in the vault. We'll figure it out. But anyhow, the chat was demanding to check out that game in the chat rooms. I posted a link in chat. I apologize to those on the podcast because I can't link it to you.
2306720	2327720	But again, that's S-U-K-E-B-A-N. Sukiban. S-H-A-C-H-O-U. Satcho. Reina. R-E-N-A. Wii. That's the name of the game. And it's cats, cats and more cats. It's an action game. So I mean seriously, how can you say Uncharted 2 is the game of the year when you have this game coming out on the Wii?
2327720	2336720	I just don't. I think it's clearly. That was a statement said without considering the rest of the year.
2336720	2342720	Wow. I'm actually looking up reviews on it. To make sure it's lolcats the game.
2342720	2345720	Let us know what you find.
2345720	2362720	Ok well I still have to do. Well hold on, hold on. I got some more releases here. PlayStation 2. Beatmania 2DX 16 Empress is making its way out right now. I think it was out a little early for some people. I think it just came out in Japan this past week.
2362720	2372720	But some of your import stores will finally have it in stock this week. They know that this is one of the big games people like to import. And it's a huge release obviously being the last 2DX game on PlayStation 2. So look for that.
2372720	2381720	On the Nintendo DS Element Hunters comes out in Japan this week as well as Rune Factory 3. And a game called Roller Angels. Check that out.
2381720	2393720	And then lastly on the Sony PSP. Again these are Japanese release dates. Another release of FIFA Soccer 10. Obviously soccer is very big in countries that aren't the US.
2393720	2413720	And a game called Haru Kanaru Toki no Naka Day 3 Unme no Meikyu Aizu Ban or Treasure Box. And I've learned to look up these games and make sure they aren't like more cat games. Because they might have a weird title but it might be awesome.
2413720	2422720	But this is actually a role playing game and it's a romance simulation game. But it has to do with historical characters. Yes that's right I said romance game with historical characters.
2422720	2430720	I love how this cat game is so realistic because they have a mini dancing game where the guy is dancing around and the cat is just like I don't care.
2430720	2442720	I'm looking at the website for the game which sadly because it's all image files I can't read but like half of it. So it looks like it's a cat raising sim. Do they have a Twitter? They freaking have a Twitter.
2442720	2445720	But it's all in Japanese right? I'm gonna follow the Japanese Twitter.
2445720	2459720	Alright you do that. Actdeft in chat says now the folks in chat are kind of looking at what we just posted. Leo Shen says I got my copy. Oh he might have been talking about Beatmania because I just mentioned that.
2459720	2463720	Actdeft says best Wii game ever. Not even Epic Mickey will surpass this game.
2463720	2470720	Okay I found the description from the Twitter so I'm running it through the Nifty translator. And we'll see what it says.
2470720	2472720	Alright let me know what happens.
2472720	2484720	Okay. Cat president and choking employee recruitment on large scale. Famous cat Rena of the Superman nature blog finally appears in the game. Let's work also by you under the cat president.
2484720	2486720	What the hell does that mean?
2486720	2488720	Because it's translating.
2488720	2490720	That doesn't even fucking make sense. I love it.
2490720	2506720	So is the president of cats or something? I guess this cat Rena is a famous cat. I've actually heard of the cat before. I'm getting this game. Fuck it. I'm getting it.
2506720	2511720	Rob let's get the communal OLR copy and find a Wii that we can play it on.
2511720	2513720	Amazing. Loki has one right?
2513720	2517720	I have a Wii that I'll play it on. We'll have this game. Don't worry. It'll be coming.
2517720	2528720	Actually this was just sent to me in chat is that we actually have an exclusive sneak peek at the soundtrack for this game. It's amazing.
2528720	2532720	That sounds so familiar.
2532720	2539720	Okay the next one you're going to hear is my microphone connecting with the back of Rob's head. Ready? One, two.
2539720	2543720	Ow!
2543720	2551720	Anyhow, President Cat.
2551720	2557720	Seriously every other podcast you listen to, every single one of them will mention Uncharted 2 this week.
2557720	2563720	And they will suck its dick to no end. What other show are you going to hear about this game on?
2563720	2566720	I challenge you. What other show?
2566720	2571720	Watch there's probably at least five other shows that mention it. But seriously.
2571720	2573720	There's a reason we're different.
2573720	2574720	I'm picking a random tweet.
2574720	2576720	Alright fine. But then you gotta get into UK releases.
2576720	2582720	Okay this is just hilarious. And I love also listing stuff through the nifty translator.
2582720	2584720	Okay.
2584720	2590720	Oh never mind. Just talking about a grade schooler following their Wii. Their Twitter.
2590720	2595720	Yeah if anyone who can read Japanese wants to follow their Twitter it's Renawii.
2595720	2599720	Someone go start translating that for me right now.
2599720	2601720	Ooh I just forgot. I can run the whole thing through.
2601720	2604720	You need to like tweet to them you know. Quoting them or something.
2604720	2608720	Yeah just tweet to them and say release your game in English please.
2608720	2609720	Best game ever.
2609720	2611720	No I'm going to go on the OLR Twitter right now and tweet to them.
2611720	2614720	Actually I'm running their Twitter through Nifty.
2614720	2621720	I love. Anyone if you want one of the best translators from Japanese to English.
2621720	2625720	Seriously. Just look up Nifty Global Gate.
2625720	2631720	So yeah. Say they keep calling it President Rina.
2631720	2637720	Okay. I'm going to tweet them right now from the OLR account. Can you send me the link to their Twitter in chat?
2637720	2638720	Yeah.
2638720	2642720	And then can we do the UK releases? Sorry I know you're like trying to do five things at once but.
2642720	2644720	Where's IRC? There it is.
2644720	2652720	Alright. So she's going to get me the Twitter there and I'm going to tweet them from the OLR account saying we demand that you release this game in English.
2652720	2654720	I'm linking it to the main chat room too because I want everyone.
2654720	2656720	Alright. Sweet. I'm going to go tweet them right now.
2656720	2666720	We want this game. We want President Kat. Sacho means Kat. President by the way. Rob. Sacho means President.
2666720	2672720	Gotcha. Well now I learned a little Japanese today. Alright. Let's do UK releases.
2672720	2677720	Okay. To end this stuff on the 23rd we have Borderlands. We have CSI Deadly Intent.
2677720	2685720	Fairy Tail Fights. Forza Motorsport 3. Ghostbusters on PSP. Grand Theft Auto Chinatown Wars on PSP.
2685720	2694720	Lips number one hits. What the fuck ever. Marvel Superhero Squad. Nintendo Presents Style Boutique. Ew.
2694720	2703720	Pro Evolution Soccer 2010. WWE Smackdown vs Raw 2010. And that's it.
2703720	2704720	Alright.
2704720	2706720	And President Kat!
2706720	2708720	No. Not in the. Here's what I'm saying to them.
2708720	2710720	I'm making an icon of President Kat.
2710720	2714720	We are talking about your game on our show right now and we demand you release it in English in the US.
2714720	2717720	President Kat for USA.
2717720	2726720	Alright. In fact. Please retweet the fuck out of this please. Thank you. I'm going to post it shortly.
2726720	2728720	Okay.
2728720	2735720	Also if any of our listeners that speak Japanese please retweet it to them in Japanese. Thank you.
2735720	2740720	This needs to happen. Alright. Anyway. There's probably some people listening to this show right now like.
2740720	2741720	Release date.
2741720	2742720	What are they smoking tonight?
2742720	2747720	10-22. Countdown will deliver a picture of their cute and funny friend, Rina.
2747720	2752720	Is a marijuana farm burning in Sacramento tonight? I mean seriously. What is going on?
2752720	2756720	SSJ100 Matt says Shermie is secretary of Katnipp.
2756720	2758720	Dude I love this Kat.
2758720	2764720	Alright. Moving on there's other video gaming stories. Believe it or not. Other than President Kat we will keep you posted.
2764720	2771720	Please again. Please please please retweet our message to Rina Wee. We want them to notice. Please.
2771720	2772720	Okay.
2772720	2774720	We want President Kat.
2774720	2782720	Alright. In other news that's not President Kat related and unfortunately makes it less important is Blaze.
2782720	2787720	Which is a company that makes third party peripherals for game systems like the Wii and the PlayStation 3.
2787720	2797720	Well they have now put out a brand new motion 3D controller that looks exactly like a Wii remote.
2797720	2800720	So much so I wouldn't be surprised if they get sued for it.
2800720	2806720	But. Hey whatever. It says it works fine at Sega Tennis and Tiger Woods.
2806720	2810720	But it looks exactly like a Wii remote.
2810720	2814720	Good luck with your lawsuit.
2814720	2827720	However. There's always a however. However. It will not work with President Kat because President Kat is coming out on the Wii and not the PlayStation 3.
2827720	2828720	Anyway.
2828720	2835720	I'm also making a call by the way for making President Kat be a trending topic.
2835720	2845720	I hope it works. Alright. Here's the thing. Why are they doing this when the PlayStation 3 is doing their own?
2845720	2848720	And how are they possibly getting away with it without Sony bringing the smack down?
2848720	2852720	I mean doesn't this kind of thing have to have some type of Sony license anyway?
2852720	2855720	Especially considering the fact that it works with existing games?
2855720	2865720	Maybe. I don't know how they're doing it. But it'll be something that's not very useful.
2865720	2871720	Probably won't sell that much. Especially when the Cosmic Ice Cream Cones come out.
2871720	2878720	But for right now. Hey if you want to buy this to use in your two games that it supports.
2878720	2881720	More power to you I guess.
2881720	2885720	I don't even really know how it'd work because it doesn't look like it has analog sticks on it.
2885720	2889720	I mean maybe that little grey circle is supposed to be an analog stick.
2889720	2893720	But I mean it looks like it's missing most of the buttons on there.
2893720	2899720	So I don't know. I'm confused.
2899720	2905720	It just looks like a cheap knockoff. Which I'm sure it is. But I still don't understand the legal end of it.
2905720	2909720	Like how they can possibly get away with it and how Sony is letting it happen.
2909720	2911720	I guess it looks different enough than the Wii Remote.
2911720	2915720	But it's basically got the trigger underneath where the B button would normally be.
2915720	2919720	It's got the directional pad at the top just like the Wii Remote.
2919720	2923720	Instead of just the 1 and 2 button at the bottom like the Wii Remote.
2923720	2927720	It has the 4 buttons that are normally on the face of the controller.
2927720	2931720	In the middle it's got 3 other buttons which I can't really read what they say.
2931720	2935720	I think it's Start, Select, and maybe the PlayStation button.
2935720	2941720	And then 3 more buttons kind of in the middle there which I have no idea what those do either.
2941720	2947720	But whatever. Like I said, if you really want to buy it then check it out I guess.
2947720	2953720	But it looks like cheap knockoff crap and you'd better just wait for the real thing.
2953720	2959720	It's tough when you're making this controller that really serves somewhat of a purpose but it's not that important.
2959720	2967720	It's not anything like the Frag FX or something like that where you're actually making something that you use a mouse to aim or something like that.
2967720	2969720	So it's more like PC.
2969720	2982720	But this, I guess it's more immersive for Tiger Woods but I'd really just wait for the official motion controller from Sony because it'll probably be even better.
2982720	2988720	And what's the point in dropping money now for something that's not very good when you can just wait a few more months and the official thing comes out.
2988720	2990720	I don't know.
2990720	2995720	Alright. Moving on to something that's so interesting.
2995720	2997720	I don't even know how to define this here.
2997720	2999720	This is a complete 180. A different type of story here.
2999720	3001720	But it has to do with Phantasy Star Portable 2.
3001720	3004720	Which, you know, we've been talking about Sega and crazy things from Japan tonight.
3004720	3006720	This is right up the alley of these types of stories.
3006720	3014720	Phantasy Star Portable 2 is going to be getting some product placement and it's kind of extreme.
3014720	3022720	First off, there's going to be Fanta products in the game like the drink, you know, Wanna Fanta, that whole thing are going to be showing up in Phantasy Star Portable 2.
3022720	3023720	They're still around.
3023720	3027720	Well, you're talking about the official drink of Germany during World War 2.
3027720	3028720	I guess.
3028720	3034720	But then also, something to note is that Pizza Hut branding is now going to show up in the game.
3034720	3043720	Apparently, you're actually going to be able to have like pizza related shields and swords and things of that note.
3043720	3051720	And I'm looking at the site that is running the story here, andreasang.com.
3051720	3055720	And they actually have screenshots of this chick and it doesn't look photoshopped.
3055720	3056720	Like, I think this is the real deal.
3056720	3057720	Oh, that's the real deal.
3057720	3061720	A little Pizza Hut box and a pizza pan.
3061720	3064720	Yes, you will actually be able to get like Pizza 2.
3064720	3072720	Seafood mixed pizza for 2500 Meseta and cheese and cheese pizza for 1900 Meseta will actually be available in the game.
3072720	3076720	There's a little like pizza place in the game and so forth.
3076720	3080720	So, I mean, I just don't really like get it.
3080720	3084720	Like, A, that sword and shield is god awful ugly.
3084720	3089720	But, I mean, what does pizza have to do with Phantasy Star?
3089720	3094720	I mean, I guess it's like product placement, just like you see in the billboards and the racing games here in the US.
3094720	3096720	But it's a little extreme, don't you think?
3096720	3101720	Well, keep in mind, Sega had a whole game based around Pepsi.
3101720	3104720	This isn't Farfetch'd.
3104720	3105720	I guess.
3105720	3109720	Pepsiman, Rob! They need Pepsiman versus Pizza Hut.
3109720	3112720	You can't help but go, okay, this is a little bit much.
3112720	3116720	Like, it's one thing in Crazy Taxi to have the KFC and Pizza Hut that you have to drop people off.
3116720	3119720	Doesn't Pepsi Cola own Pizza Hut?
3119720	3121720	I think so, yeah.
3121720	3123720	Is Pepsi gonna buy Sega? Is that where we're going?
3123720	3126720	Maybe that's just what's gonna happen, I don't know.
3126720	3132720	Tigerclaw in chat says, I remember seeing Pizza Hut billboards in TMNT 2, the arcade on the NES.
3132720	3136720	Yeah, it's not that, like, product placement in video games is anything new, although, you know, I don't know how-
3136720	3137720	It was Domino's in the movie.
3137720	3139720	I don't know if it's often talked about.
3139720	3145720	But, I mean, when it gets, like, in your face so much as, like, you're carrying around a giant Pizza Hut box,
3145720	3149720	and, I guess, hitting monsters with it or blocking their attacks with it,
3149720	3155720	I mean, it kind of starts to cross the line of WTF, LOL.
3155720	3161720	Deathwishing says, the acceptable games with product placement are sports and racing games unless they're futuristic,
3161720	3164720	but if it's a shooter or RPG, no, no.
3164720	3169720	And it's not cheeseball enough to where, you know, they really could be over the top with everything, like,
3169720	3176720	you know, have product placement everywhere and just, like, ridiculous weapons based on, you know,
3176720	3181720	you know, the golden arches or something, you know, that'd be kind of funny.
3181720	3183720	Crazy, crazy.
3183720	3186720	By the way, thank you so much to the people that are retweeting our message.
3186720	3190720	We have almost, like, a full page of tweets there of people retweeting our message.
3190720	3193720	They've got to see it. You know they're going to see it.
3193720	3199720	I've actually tried to translate a little bit more of it, so I think I've got the general story of the game.
3199720	3200720	Yeah.
3200720	3209720	So, you play as the cat, and you are part of a trio called Let's Going 3, so I'm guessing it'd be Ikimas 3, I guess.
3209720	3215720	And they are a very, very popular trio of cats.
3215720	3226720	And so, Rina, who is the editor-in-chief of production of a company, I guess, that puts out Shogakuken,
3226720	3231720	which is, like, a shoujo manga book, I guess.
3231720	3235720	This is just what I'm getting from the translation and from what little I can read.
3235720	3244720	But basically, the whole point is you're trying to get Rina and the staff to try to publish, I guess, the magazine
3244720	3246720	and try to do all this other stuff.
3246720	3249720	You have a minigame where you play the piano, and you have exercises,
3249720	3253720	but the whole point of it is to become president of the company.
3253720	3255720	Oh, and you have cosplay.
3255720	3256720	A cat?
3256720	3257720	You have kitty cosplay.
3257720	3260720	A cat that publishes an anime magazine?
3260720	3261720	No.
3261720	3263720	Mongo, whatever.
3263720	3267720	That's fucking awesome.
3267720	3270720	You have sixteen different kinds of cosplay.
3270720	3272720	I'm just giggling. This game is funny.
3272720	3275720	This is... seriously, game of the year.
3275720	3277720	This is gonna save the Wii.
3277720	3284720	I mean, because this is kind of like... the Wii is kind of a preposterous system to begin with.
3284720	3286720	This game just is right at home.
3286720	3290720	The Wii needs more games that are just OMG, WTF like this.
3290720	3291720	Amazing.
3291720	3295720	An Amazon JP is selling it for 4,410 yen.
3295720	3298720	When does it come out? Oh no, duh, I just read it during Japanese releases.
3298720	3299720	It's out this week.
3299720	3300720	Yeah, this week.
3300720	3302720	Someone buy me this.
3302720	3306720	Seriously, this is the type of random crap I would buy on Dreamcast.
3306720	3309720	Like, okay, I bought Super Producers.
3309720	3312720	If that game isn't random, I don't know what is.
3312720	3316720	Or like, what was it, the Roommate 202 or something?
3316720	3317720	Oh, I remember that one.
3317720	3318720	Or 232?
3318720	3319720	Yeah. Oh my god.
3319720	3322720	This is along the same... the Wii is the new Dreamcast.
3322720	3324720	Rob, the Wii is the Dreamcast.
3324720	3328720	Except, the Wii is actually selling a lot to soccer moms across America.
3328720	3330720	Alright, anyhow, let's move on with more stories.
3330720	3332720	DarkSakura, you're up.
3332720	3337720	I hate to make President Cat take over this whole show, but it's fucking fascinating.
3337720	3339720	I think it's fantastic.
3339720	3344720	Okay, so Microsoft seems to think that the PS3 is screwed this year.
3344720	3348720	They think that the 360 will outsell the PS3.
3348720	3355720	Aaron Greenberg, who is the big mouth of Microsoft,
3355720	3360720	is saying that when NPD releases the September sales,
3360720	3366720	they expect the PS3 is going to come in with the most units sold for the month
3366720	3370720	because of the Slim release, but overall,
3370720	3375720	that the Xbox 360 is still going to outsell for the calendar year
3375720	3377720	and for the entire system generation.
3377720	3384720	He compares it to a game of baseball where they may be ahead one inning,
3384720	3387720	but it's what you get by the end of the game, that's what counts.
3387720	3392720	So you may have won the battle, but you haven't won the war type of thing.
3392720	3393720	Exactly.
3393720	3395720	This is just one month.
3395720	3398720	And I have to agree with the article, this is burn.
3398720	3400720	He's quoted saying,
3400720	3404720	Sony, for example, has publicly noted that they lose money on every console they sell,
3404720	3406720	and with the price cut, they're now losing even more money.
3406720	3410720	So even with the PS3 in the market today at $299,
3410720	3414720	you have to question if their business model is sustainable.
3414720	3416720	I don't know.
3416720	3419720	You know, as much as I think, you know,
3419720	3424720	and I do admit I've been kind of in the past, especially on this show,
3424720	3427720	like really slanted towards 360.
3427720	3431720	I think especially this year, I have come a long way towards,
3431720	3434720	and I don't mean in reporting, I mean in, you know,
3434720	3436720	just what I play myself and what I've enjoyed.
3436720	3439720	I think this year especially, I think PS3 has gained a lot with me,
3439720	3442720	and I think, you know, kind of going into this holiday season,
3442720	3445720	I think the price drop was the best freaking thing they could do.
3445720	3448720	Let me tell you a true story, totally true,
3448720	3452720	is that the other night I was eating dinner with some co-workers,
3452720	3455720	and the people at the table next to us,
3455720	3459720	some like husbands and wives, about six of them,
3459720	3463720	in their mid-20s, and they were talking about video games,
3463720	3467720	and so I couldn't help but overhear because I'm a nosy motherfucker.
3467720	3471720	So I actually heard them talking about the Xbox 360 and the PlayStation 3,
3471720	3474720	and the guy was talking about how he's going to sell back his 360,
3474720	3477720	and the one guy actually said, and it had nothing to do with the quality,
3477720	3479720	I think they were talking financers or something,
3479720	3480720	I don't know, I didn't hear everything.
3480720	3482720	But the one guy said, well, you know, this holiday season,
3482720	3483720	I kind of want to get a game system,
3483720	3488720	but I think I want to get a PlayStation 3 because, dude, it has Blu-Ray.
3488720	3492720	You know, and now that those systems are getting closer to the same price,
3492720	3495720	you know, again, I don't think these guys were like hardcore gamers,
3495720	3497720	but they are just average people.
3497720	3498720	I overheard at a restaurant.
3498720	3502720	I think that Blu-Ray this Christmas season is going to carry a lot of weight,
3502720	3504720	and Microsoft's going to feel it.
3504720	3510720	But you can get a better quality Blu-Ray player now for cheaper
3510720	3512720	than the entire system costs.
3512720	3515720	You could, for the cost of a good PS3 bundle,
3515720	3518720	you could buy an Xbox 360 and a better Blu-Ray player.
3518720	3523720	I get that, but what about that PlayStation 2 is a DVD player mentality
3523720	3525720	that really helped out that system when it needed it?
3525720	3529720	You know, you, me, the other gamers of America, we get that.
3529720	3532720	But the people that are purchasing things en masse from Wal-Mart
3532720	3535720	and Target to put under Christmas trees, are they going to get that?
3535720	3540720	I still don't think that it's enough to save the system
3540720	3544720	because, I mean, really, I would have to see hard numbers.
3544720	3546720	I would have to look at their financial reports.
3546720	3550720	I'd have to see what it costs to produce a system, what their marketing costs.
3550720	3555720	Basically, I'd have to see overhead versus sales to get an idea to project.
3555720	3560720	It seems to me that they would have to sell a hell of a lot to make up past losses
3560720	3566720	and their current losses for overall system sales versus the overhead.
3566720	3567720	Now, don't get me wrong.
3567720	3569720	Can you tell I've been working in finance too long?
3569720	3570720	Now, don't get me wrong.
3570720	3574720	I'm not trying to say that I suddenly hate the 360.
3574720	3575720	That's certainly not true.
3575720	3579720	I think either way, Microsoft is going to definitely give them a run for their money,
3579720	3582720	and they're probably, in the end, will still come out ahead.
3582720	3586720	But I think if they were smart, what Microsoft would do is kind of go for the jugular.
3586720	3591720	What's the biggest, for the mass population, asset of the PlayStation 3? Blu-ray.
3591720	3596720	But what does the 360 have? Downloadable movies with Netflix specifically.
3596720	3600720	I think if they start marketing a lot with that in their Netflix partnership,
3600720	3605720	they are very likely to keep their head above water
3605720	3609720	and not let Sony get them down too bad outside of just September.
3609720	3610720	But we'll see.
3610720	3612720	It's going to be a very interesting holiday season.
3612720	3613720	I can't wait to see what happens.
3613720	3615720	I know what would save the PS3, Rob.
3615720	3616720	What?
3616720	3618720	President Cat.
3618720	3621720	Or how about Daytona?
3621720	3625720	No, President Cat.
3625720	3626720	Arena for President.
3626720	3630720	Moving on. Loki, more video game news, please.
3630720	3632720	That doesn't have to do with Cats.
3632720	3637720	Well, one thing that Sony doesn't have, unfortunately, is the Ballad of Gay Tony.
3637720	3640720	And that will be coming out, actually, next week.
3640720	3644720	Well, the 29th, I guess, two weeks.
3644720	3652720	They did release some new information regarding the multiplayer in the new episode for the 360.
3652720	3658720	Some of the things that they get, new areas to have Deathmatch and Team Deathmatches,
3658720	3662720	including some new and closed areas as well.
3662720	3668720	Some that are actually in the clubs.
3668720	3673720	Most of the Deathmatch maps that are out there right now for Grand Theft Auto
3673720	3675720	were all just pretty much spots in the city.
3675720	3677720	But these are actually in addition to that stuff.
3677720	3680720	At least, I hope it's in addition to that and not just replacing it
3680720	3683720	because that would really suck if they did replace it.
3683720	3685720	But we'll see.
3685720	3691720	Some other new things adding to Deathmatch other than just locations.
3691720	3697720	They have killstreak bonuses, where if you kill 3 people, 5 people, or 10 people in a row,
3697720	3700720	you get health and armor bonuses.
3700720	3706720	And also, if someone kills you, breaking your streak, they will earn $125 instead of just $100.
3706720	3712720	Also, for assists, where you do damage to somebody and someone else takes the kill for it,
3712720	3716720	you also make $25 for that, whereas before you made nothing.
3716720	3721720	And of course, they have new weapon classes to break things apart.
3721720	3726720	They've got episodic, automatic, sniper rifles, explosives, and sticky bombs.
3726720	3728720	I'm kind of interested about the episodic.
3728720	3731720	Lol, gay Tony has sticky bombs.
3731720	3738720	Hahaha. I'm interested to see if they actually, since it does have episodic,
3738720	3742720	if it will include both the first and second episodes,
3742720	3746720	which would be pretty awesome if they had some sort of cross-play with that.
3746720	3753720	Free mode, they've added some new options, including the ability to use the parachutes in the game,
3753720	3758720	and of course your tanks and the new buzzard attack helicopter, which is pretty awesome.
3758720	3766720	And that's pretty much it for right now, but very excited about this new expansion coming out.
3766720	3770720	Okay, so I have to admit, as somebody who doesn't really play a lot of Grand Theft Auto,
3770720	3773720	a lot of that was blah blah blah to me, so you have to kind of translate.
3773720	3775720	Is this going to be a good thing for the game?
3775720	3778720	Yes, it's going to be awesome. It's going to basically enhance multiplayer a lot,
3778720	3783720	and bring it to the over-the-topness of the other Grand Theft Auto games.
3783720	3786720	Alright, and that's what people love about it, right?
3786720	3788720	Yes, alright.
3788720	3795720	Moving on, in other news, speaking of big multiplayer games, Left 4 Dead, as you know, there was a boycott.
3795720	3800720	41,000 people had made this group on Steam, the Left 4 Dead 2 boycott group.
3800720	3804720	Apparently, it has been brought to an end.
3804720	3808720	And this has to do with one of the co-founders, Agent of Chaos.
3808720	3812720	You might remember a couple weeks ago, we talked about how they actually got invited to Valve's headquarters and so forth,
3812720	3819720	and we were kind of joking, oh, sold out and all this stuff, which certainly the community was accusing them of.
3819720	3824720	But they said, quote, our goal wasn't to steer people away from Left 4 Dead 2,
3824720	3828720	it was to get Valve's attention and have them support Left 4 Dead.
3828720	3835720	So apparently, since they have continued to support Left 4 Dead with content, they have declared the boycott over.
3835720	3837720	Hmm, interesting.
3837720	3839720	But you know, the boycott was a little silly in the first place.
3839720	3843720	It's also mainly because they were worried that Left 4 Dead 2 was just going to be some add-on crap,
3843720	3846720	and it's not going to be that much of a game to stand alone by itself.
3846720	3855720	And they really have added a lot to Left 4 Dead 2 to really warrant it as another release, and not just add-on stuff.
3855720	3859720	Do you think they'll continue to support Left 4 Dead 1, even while Left 4 Dead 2 is out?
3859720	3863720	I mean, EverQuest 1 still got upgrade packs, and EverQuest 2 is out.
3863720	3866720	Maybe. I don't know. Maybe. You never know.
3866720	3870720	Well, you know, I never understood the boycott to begin with, so I can't say this is...
3870720	3874720	Well, actually, it is surprising. You don't usually hear about boycotts coming to an end.
3874720	3877720	You just hear about, come to my online petition and sign it.
3877720	3884720	So I guess I have to say, I haven't really heard that before, but it is kind of lol-tastic that those guys actually went out to Valve and now they're canceling their boycott.
3884720	3886720	But, you know, whatever.
3886720	3889720	It was a little bit of a silly boycott in the first place, I think.
3889720	3893720	So would we have this problem if the game came out like a year from now?
3893720	3895720	Probably not, because...
3895720	3898720	And what if they had never released any upgrades for Left 4 Dead?
3898720	3904720	You know, I kind of go back to the thing, like, what does Valve really owe you outside of the base game?
3904720	3905720	You know?
3905720	3910720	Look at Madden. I mean, they have a bunch of updates and stuff from Madden, and there's a new version that comes out every year.
3910720	3916720	I don't see why they need to owe them anything, just like Need for Speed or a lot of EA games.
3916720	3921720	Who cares? You know? You buy it or you don't buy it. That's it, you know?
3921720	3924720	And you'll bitch and moan about it all you want, but...
3924720	3926720	Post to the internet on your favorite forum.
3926720	3929720	Yeah, post to the internet. You know, complain that it's not President Cat.
3929720	3935720	And then, you know, you'll just buy it anyways, because you're consumer whore.
3935720	3937720	And how.
3937720	3940720	Alright, let's move on to another segment we love to do here on the program.
3940720	3944720	It is a segment we like to call the Classic Game of the Week.
3944720	3950720	It's a segment where Dark Soccer actually goes into the video game Vault and pulls out one of her favorite classic games and she says,
3950720	3955720	You know what, bitches? You should be playing this game right now.
3955720	3959720	So Dark Soccer, you've dived into the vault and you've picked out a game that you think everyone should be playing.
3959720	3960720	What game?
3960720	3962720	I died.
3962720	3965720	Fine, you swam. I don't know what you did. Whatever you did.
3965720	3967720	Um, the classic game is...
3967720	3969720	Dude, dude, dude, dude, dude your way in there.
3969720	3972720	Is Hexen.
3972720	3975720	Not Heretic, but Hexen.
3975720	3979720	And this is actually the best quality of the music I could find other than having them.
3979720	3983720	Punch. Smack. Chicken.
3983720	3990720	So yeah, Hexen is a first person shooter that was put up by Raven and published by ID.
3990720	3993720	I-B-E.
3993720	4007720	And it's actually the sequel to Heretic, however it has better points to it, which makes me really put it over the first one that came out.
4007720	4017720	There were PlayStation, Saturn, and N64 versions, but the N64 one was the only really good one that came out.
4017720	4022720	It was the best conversion. The Saturn and PlayStation ones actually had some...
4022720	4025720	They were only one player and had some frame rate losses.
4025720	4038720	So anyway, you are playing as Kronos who is going on and you actually can play as either a fighter, a cleric, or a mage.
4038720	4054720	And they have their own different weapons and the fighter is mainly a melee, the cleric has special weapons and healing effects and the mage has long range weapons and is also pretty damn fragile.
4054720	4063720	So it's first person. You go through these sprightly, fake 3D places and smite things.
4063720	4065720	It was Doom with Magic.
4065720	4072720	It was Doom with Magic. And actually Hexen uses the Doom engine. So you can jump. You can jump.
4072720	4087720	You also have a hub system of level progression and this one actually had, where the previous ones used on MIDI music, this one actually used full Redbook audio.
4087720	4096720	You've got moving walls in the game. So they actually had to modify Doom's engine.
4096720	4104720	Also, the source code was released in 2008 so now you can get Hexen for Linux, which is pretty good.
4104720	4110720	And also it's compatible with a lot of the Doom source ports.
4110720	4121720	There was an expansion pack called Death Kings of the Dark Citadel and it had 20 new levels and deathmatch levels.
4121720	4130720	And you actually had to either buy it in store or by mail order.
4130720	4136720	It's just a really good game. It actually had some of the best cheats ever in it.
4136720	4141720	The NRA code was all weapons.
4141720	4144720	You can turn yourself into a chicken.
4144720	4146720	Seriously, you can turn yourself into a chicken.
4146720	4148720	It's the anti-Zelda.
4148720	4150720	It was a fun game.
4150720	4155720	I know you usually don't like first person shooters because they make you sick because they're so realistic.
4155720	4157720	This was sprite based.
4157720	4158720	Yeah, sprite based isn't as bad.
4158720	4162720	It didn't really make me all that motion sick. I'd have to stop because I'd get headaches.
4162720	4168720	But it didn't really make me full on sick to my stomach, ready to throw up on the cat or anything.
4168720	4173720	Alright, there you go kids. Your classic game of the week, Hexen from id.
4173720	4177720	Which you can still get. In fact, someone in chat was saying they were just playing it earlier today.
4177720	4182720	Who was saying that? I just saw it in chat a minute ago.
4182720	4184720	Gosh, I'm behind on chat or something.
4184720	4186720	Sorry, somebody had said they were playing. Oh, there it is.
4186720	4189720	Frisbee says, I was just playing this online today through school tag.
4189720	4192720	So you can play it, I guess, online in different places.
4192720	4195720	So check it out.
4195720	4198720	Deathwishing, I guess, hasn't heard the chat on the show before.
4198720	4202720	Wants to know, how do you get sick from playing first person shooters?
4202720	4205720	It's called vertigo.
4205720	4209720	I have a friend at work who has that real bad too.
4209720	4212720	She can't get on boats or anything. It makes her very sick.
4212720	4218720	It's just, I really don't know what it is. It's something between the eye and inner ear, I guess.
4218720	4227720	But it's like, I guess, I think it's that your brain starts compensating for the motion that it sees.
4227720	4233720	When your body isn't feeling the same motion and it causes a conflict in your balance.
4233720	4236720	That just makes me sick right away.
4236720	4240720	Also, another thing that will do it to me is rendering errors.
4240720	4245720	You know, like when Sonic Adventure, when the Japanese version had all those bad rendering errors
4245720	4250720	and the collision detection wasn't bad and you could actually see through the wall at some points and see the edge.
4250720	4253720	It's like, I couldn't process it. It would just stop.
4253720	4257720	I would literally have to close my eyes because it would make my head hurt.
4257720	4261720	HungryMrKrunk in chat says, I can't play Spyro. I get sick.
4261720	4265720	Well, is that motion sickness or just because you're playing Spyro?
4265720	4269720	Brad from Paw Culture says, well, Vertigo, it's a good flick.
4269720	4271720	Vertigo, shoot.
4271720	4273720	It's a good movie, but...
4273720	4280720	I did know who did the opening credits for that, too, because we studied it in my typography or my graphic design class.
4280720	4284720	Because the opening titles to it were so amazing.
4284720	4286720	Wasn't it the same as Psycho?
4286720	4287720	I think it was Saul Bass.
4287720	4293720	Saul Bass is seriously the best movie title designer ever, but I digress.
4293720	4296720	Death Wishing just seems to think it's bad games that make you sick, but...
4296720	4304720	Well, GoldenEye, which is supposed to be one of the best N64 first person shooters, made me really sick.
4304720	4308720	I couldn't play Unreal.
4308720	4312720	I couldn't play Portal. Oh my god.
4312720	4316720	You want to see me just get so sick? Dan had to play through Portal for me.
4316720	4318720	I would tell him what to do.
4318720	4319720	So that you could look away and...
4319720	4327720	I would tell him how to pass, because I could easily see how to pass all of the puzzles and everything.
4327720	4333720	But I would literally have to tell him, because the moment that I held the controller in my hand and actually looked at the screen to do it,
4333720	4336720	I would be sick. Katamari does it. Katamari makes me really sick.
4336720	4340720	I can't play more than two levels before I get way too ill to keep playing.
4340720	4341720	That sucks.
4341720	4344720	Alright, well, hopefully they'll come out with an app for that.
4344720	4346720	I didn't do it on my iPhone.
4346720	4348720	Well, iPhone's so tiny.
4348720	4349720	I didn't get that sick on my iPhone.
4349720	4350720	You probably don't get as immersed there.
4350720	4351720	Yeah.
4351720	4353720	SGA-100 Matt does confirm it's Sawbass.
4353720	4354720	Yeah.
4354720	4356720	I knew it was Sawbass.
4356720	4363720	Alright, for anyone who ever wanted to know, I don't know if you do, but Sawbass is one of my designer heroes.
4363720	4368720	So, just go watch the opening credits for the man with the golden arm and you'll know.
4368720	4369720	Alright.
4369720	4374720	Well, that is going to bring this Part A of Orange Lounge Radio to a close, but don't go anywhere kids,
4374720	4376720	because we'll be right back with plenty more tonight in Part B.
4376720	4381720	We have our rapid fire news, talking about some news about Final Fantasy XI, Mass Effect 2, and so forth.
4381720	4383720	And then, of course, our long stories.
4383720	4385720	We're going to talk about people getting banned from Xbox and why.
4385720	4389720	More talk about a Wii HD and a new peripheral for the Wii.
4389720	4393720	That is all coming up in just a little bit here on Orange Lounge Radio.
4393720	4395720	So, we will be right back.
4395720	4402720	Stay tuned.
4402720	4404720	Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio.
4404720	4412720	Live on this lovely Sunday evening, October the 18th of 2009, where we are taping the 341st episode of our show.
4412720	4415720	And during the break, we heard some music there from DJ Hero.
4415720	4417720	You can only hear that live, sadly, because it is copyright.
4417720	4419720	We can't put it in the podcast.
4419720	4421720	Kind of like what we did last week, except this time it wasn't the demo.
4421720	4422720	It was the full game.
4422720	4423720	Yeah.
4423720	4425720	Paul Van Dyke, you were saying you had a favorite song already?
4425720	4429720	Yes, that Paul Van Dyke track, the one we played, was absolutely awesome.
4429720	4433720	They had a demo online, or a little clip online on their YouTube channel.
4433720	4435720	I just love that song.
4435720	4437720	I couldn't wait to play it, and it's really hard.
4437720	4441720	It has a lot of cross-fading in there, and it's really hard.
4441720	4446720	I was actually able to listen on the iPhone app for All Games.
4446720	4449720	Which, by the way, if you own an iPhone and you don't have this app, it's awesome.
4449720	4454720	You should check it out at All Games' website, or just look for it in the store.
4454720	4460720	It's an application where you can actually just play All Games Radio without needing any other type of tuner program or anything.
4460720	4461720	It's amazing.
4461720	4462720	Noelle's is amazing?
4462720	4463720	What?
4463720	4464720	Chicken.
4464720	4465720	Chicken is amazing.
4465720	4467720	Are you enjoying the Kentucky Fried Chicken that I went and got on Parade?
4467720	4468720	Yes, thank you.
4468720	4471720	You know, I could have, you know, I forgot.
4471720	4475720	I could just have that autoplay, like the actual tracks I wanted, so they'd be flawless.
4475720	4476720	But it's more fun to play.
4476720	4478720	Yeah, it's more fun to play it.
4478720	4488720	Folks, we have breaking news here at Orange Lounge Radio.
4488720	4490720	We have breaking news developing right now.
4490720	4499720	The folks at Rina We, the president cat game that we were laughing hysterically at in Part A, they have responded on their Twitter.
4499720	4504720	And boy have they ever, I don't think they know what the hell is going on right now.
4504720	4510720	They responded to some, one of our listeners, Technicolor, who tweeted our message that said, please release this game in the USA.
4510720	4511720	They said, really?
4511720	4512720	I'm so excited.
4512720	4513720	Is this spam?
4513720	4515720	So, A, we know they speak English.
4515720	4518720	Even though they've been tweeting in Japanese, somebody over there speaks English.
4518720	4521720	And then they tweeted us and some other listeners, can I ask one question?
4521720	4522720	How do you know this game?
4522720	4525720	And I think somebody said back to them that they were hearing it here on Orange Lounge Radio.
4525720	4527720	They tweeted back, oh my goodness, really?
4527720	4529720	Thank you so much.
4529720	4531720	I'm talking about this with coworkers right now.
4531720	4533720	They are all excited.
4533720	4536720	If this information on some website, let me know the URL.
4536720	4537720	Please retweet.
4537720	4542720	And they've been corresponding with one of our listeners on Twitter, Edmund Lu, I guess, has been helping them out.
4542720	4550720	And they told them that we were getting it from playasia.com, the release dates, which is where I read the Japanese release dates from.
4550720	4553720	And they responded, thank you so much.
4553720	4556720	And they retweeted so that all their followers could see it.
4556720	4560720	OLR talked about it on their radio show, and it really looks like an interesting game to play.
4560720	4563720	And then they said, thanks, is this popular in the USA?
4563720	4564720	Sorry for many questions.
4564720	4575720	So in the scope of just that time that Loki was playing DJ Hero during the break, they've tweeted six times about this President Cat takes over the USA tonight, Life on Orange Lounge Radio thing going on.
4575720	4583720	I also replied to that last thing saying that, yeah, some gamers like that kind of thing, stuff other than the sports and the typical RPG.
4583720	4586720	And that I personally love those kinds of games.
4586720	4592720	Oh, less than a minute ago, they have responded to one of my tweets because I wrote them back saying,
4592720	4597720	we found it on our weekly Japanese release date reading and think we need more lolcat inspired games.
4597720	4599720	How can we help get game in USA?
4599720	4602720	I said, it's not popular yet, but we think if it was released here, that it just might be.
4602720	4605720	There are many piano playing cat loving people here.
4605720	4610720	And they just said, you mean game in English? Retweet.
4610720	4614720	Okay, so I'm going to respond, yes, basically.
4614720	4617720	Yes, game in English.
4624720	4626720	Okay, so sorry for the dead air. So I'm tweeting back right now.
4626720	4629720	Yes, game in English and playable on our American Wiis.
4629720	4633720	And somebody in the chat room is like shouting, get them on the show, get them on the show.
4633720	4637720	I don't know if Japan can call our 800 numbers.
4637720	4644720	We have a friend that lives in Japan who is currently, you know, Julie.
4644720	4645720	Yeah.
4645720	4646720	Julie is in Japan right now.
4646720	4647720	Well, could we get...
4647720	4650720	Julie is with Krista. Krista speaks fluent Japanese.
4650720	4653720	I wonder if we can get them on Skype or something. I don't know.
4653720	4657720	I'll tell them, they added us back so I can direct message them. So I'll tell them to email me.
4657720	4661720	I don't want to do anything tonight because it's all panning out too fast, but we'll try to get them on a future show.
4661720	4663720	I am going to love this.
4663720	4668720	AlphaCananagram in chat says, this is one kick-ass episode of OLR.
4668720	4674720	Let me put it this way, okay? There's many companies out there like Tomo, well not necessarily Tomo,
4674720	4679720	but was it UFO Interactive Games and stuff like that, they port really obscure shit.
4679720	4688720	I mean, just really obscure Japanese RPGs or not even Japanese RPGs, like Japanese shooters and just weird games, you know, for budget prices.
4688720	4694720	One of these companies could easily pick this game up. It's just, you know, whether they think they can actually sell some copies of it.
4694720	4699720	They just tweeted it again. And keep in mind, it's like noon in Japan on a Monday morning right now, right?
4699720	4701720	Because they're up across on the other side of the date lines. It's probably about noon right there.
4701720	4707720	And they just tweeted again, great people, awesome. And they put at OLR, there are many piano playing cat loving people,
4707720	4714720	because that's what I said to them. So this is amazing. So we're going to correspond with them.
4714720	4720720	They could do like a viral advertisement or whatever with keyboard cat. I think they could have something, you know?
4720720	4726720	They could get the whole main loving people. Especially if the price is right, you know?
4726720	4732720	Okay, so we may need your friend in Japan to somehow get a hold of these people and talk to them in Japanese.
4732720	4737720	I don't know if we can make that happen, but I want them on the show. This needs to happen.
4737720	4744720	They love us. We love what they're doing. We are going to get this game released in the USA. And dammit, it all started right here tonight.
4744720	4746720	Let me see if she's online.
4746720	4753720	Alright, anyhow. Anyhow, I don't know what we have to do. If we're going to have to do one of those silly online petitions or what.
4753720	4759720	But meanwhile, we have a show to do. We got to get to Twitter topics. Here's the thing, I am not prepared for Twitter topics,
4759720	4762720	because usually I can just click on the at OLR messages and they're all right there.
4762720	4767720	But tonight, because of President Cat, our Twitter is full, so I need to go back a little bit.
4767720	4770720	I'm going to mix things up a little. Why not? It's one of those nights.
4770720	4774720	I think we should put a post on the front page about, you know, bring President Cat to the US.
4774720	4776720	I mean, that would be awesome.
4776720	4783720	We'll figure something out. Absolutely. Maybe we can get some of our friends and Game Ballers involved.
4783720	4789720	I don't know what we can do. We'll figure it out. All I know is that all unfolding live here on Sunday night might be a bit much.
4789720	4796720	So, we're going to get into some Twitter, not Twitter topics, I'm sorry, fast news. Loki's going to cover some quick news stories for us.
4796720	4805720	Yes. Okay, so Final Fantasy XI The Ultimate Collection, not the first collection that they released on PC, but probably the last,
4805720	4812720	will be coming out, of course, for $20 soon. November 10th is the date that's coming out.
4812720	4822720	And actually, that will be coming out on 360 as well. And as you might expect, it's basically the game plus all the downloadable expansions and whatnot.
4822720	4827720	For $20, it's not a bad price at all, especially if you're looking to get into Final Fantasy XI.
4827720	4835720	Although, at this point, I would wonder why you wouldn't just wait for Final Fantasy XIV, but hey, to each their own and $20 is very cheap.
4835720	4847720	Also, Zen Studios, the creators of such wonderful games like Zen Pinball, Pinball FX, and The Punisher of No Mercy, are releasing a brand new game to the PlayStation Network called Planet Mini Golf.
4847720	4859720	It is going to be a game featuring 144 mini golf holes with several exhilarating courses around the world, they say, complete with crazy obstacles and six customizable characters.
4859720	4864720	And it looks pretty sweet. I love me some mini golf games.
4864720	4874720	Finally, as rumored, Sony is releasing a 250GB PlayStation 3 slim model over here in the US as well.
4874720	4884720	It is coming standalone, no packing games with that, and only for $50 more than the 120GB system, so $349.99 will be the price on that.
4884720	4890720	Which is not a bad deal if you're looking to really pack a lot of crap onto your PlayStation 3 hard drive.
4890720	4896720	So that will be coming out around November 3rd.
4896720	4902720	Alright, sorry, they wrote back again. I hate to keep going back to this, but I'm loving this.
4902720	4908720	They're asking their boss right now. They put, wow, ask my boss, haha, wait a minute please.
4908720	4914720	And retweeted our message about, yes, game in English and playable on our American Wiis, how can we help make this happen?
4914720	4922720	So, some executive at some Japanese game company right now is hearing about some crappy little internet show in America that wants this damn game.
4922720	4924720	Dude, totally want President Cat.
4924720	4926720	Amazing. I love the internet.
4926720	4930720	And hey, you know, maybe if all its fellows will just send us a Japanese Wii in the game.
4930720	4935720	Just put it on WiiWare. I mean, honestly, it can't be that big of a game. I mean, just put it on WiiWare.
4935720	4936720	President Cat!
4936720	4943720	Alright, well, when Twitter ladies, bosses, or guys, I don't know who it is, but when that boss gets back to them, we will have more.
4943720	4947720	Meantime, more late-breaking, well, not late-breaking, but rapid-fire news anyway.
4947720	4953720	News about Super Mario Bros. Wii, the new one coming out. Did you know Princess Peach is not playable in the game?
4953720	4958720	Actually, this was brought up recently in an interview with Miyamoto, and Miyamoto commented,
4958720	4964720	quote, I thought it'd be nice to have her as a playable character, but the Toad characters have a similar physique to a Mario character than Peach does.
4964720	4972720	And if one of the four had a dress, we'd have to come up with a special programming to handle how the skirt is handled in the gameplay, and that's really the only reason why Peach isn't playable.
4972720	4976720	Of course, if we had Wario in there, we'd have to program a way to make him fart.
4976720	4985720	Is that maybe a throwback to the fact that people in Super Smash Bros. Melee were just pausing the game to do upskirt cams on Princess Peach and Daisy? I don't know.
4985720	4990720	But regardless, it sounds like they're trying to skirt the issue. Her, her.
4990720	4997720	Mass Effect 2 now has a release date. It's coming out in North America on January 26th, and it's coming out in Europe on the 29th.
4997720	5005720	Is there really anything else you need to know? Well, you might want to know about the GameStop pre-order bonus that they're advertising, including Terminus Armor.
5005720	5011720	It will increase the run speed and personal shields, and augmenting weapons with an additional magazine of reserve ammo.
5011720	5019720	And then the M90 Blackstorm Heavy Weapon will generate a high-powered localized gravity well, accelerating particles to near-infinite mass.
5019720	5025720	So there you go, some pre-order bonuses for Mass Effect 2, officially dated for January, both North America and Europe.
5025720	5036720	Duels of the Planeswalker gets a new expansion on Xbox 360. They think the name is Duel of the Dragons, but it is being priced only 400 Microsoft points.
5036720	5044720	It is coming out on the 21st of October. It's going to add three playable decks and three unlockable cards for all of the original decks.
5044720	5050720	So there you go, some new expansions coming to Magic the Gathering, which hopefully you didn't forget was out there on the Wii.
5050720	5058720	Let's do Jamie's Stories. We never did our closed deck tournament, Rob. We never did, we need to.
5058720	5064720	Well, how about some news about Alpha Protocol, which actually really isn't very much news because I think we expected it.
5064720	5071720	It is delayed instead of being out, even for Christmas, they're pushing it back to Spring 2010.
5071720	5081720	But Obsidian, the developer, is actually pretty happy about that because it gives them more time to make sure it's really polished and looking the way that they want it to.
5081720	5088720	So I think that's a good thing. I would rather wait for a good product than have to deal with substandard.
5088720	5093720	Yeah, delays aren't always a bad thing. Delays can sometimes end out pretty good.
5093720	5106720	Also, two characters for Tatsunoko vs. Capcom have been released. We have Condor Nojo as Joe the Condor from Gatchaman.
5106720	5110720	He was G2, the one who always wanted to fire the bird missile.
5110720	5118720	Also, just to say, for anyone who watched Battle of the Planets, it was Jason. He was Dirk in G-Force.
5118720	5123720	Anyway, I'm the Gatchaman fangirl, so I'm very happy about this.
5123720	5131720	And then there's also Zero. Zero is going to be out, as in Zero from the Mega Man X series.
5131720	5134720	So that's going to be pretty sweet.
5134720	5141720	I actually watched videos of them in motion and it was epic.
5141720	5153720	Also, the team up with... they had Joe and Jun on one of the matches I saw and they did the Tatsumaki attack.
5153720	5157720	That was pretty cool. That was pretty damn cool. I'm looking so forward to this.
5157720	5160720	Except I really don't like what they did with the Tatsunoko logo in English.
5160720	5166720	It doesn't look nice. They should have just stuck to the Japanese one.
5166720	5173720	And, last but definitely not least, Blur is going to be in LEGO Rock Band.
5173720	5187720	And there are little blur-shaped, you know, LEGO stick people all bricked out for LEGO Rock Band, so that makes me pretty happy.
5187720	5195720	I'm just sort of laughing at the little Damon and the little Graham. I think that's pretty funny.
5195720	5199720	That's just cute. But that's it.
5199720	5205720	Alright. Moving on, we're going to get into some Twitter topics. You guys ready to do Twitter?
5205720	5209720	I know we had a lot of Twitter tonight with what the developments were present in CAT,
5209720	5214720	which apparently they just posted some type of comic that has our chat room in stitches right now.
5214720	5220720	I'm loving this. I mean, live radio doesn't... I'm serious. We should petition this stuff.
5220720	5224720	We should send it all out, you know, tell people why this game needs to come over here.
5224720	5226720	Well, let's wait and see how they respond.
5226720	5228720	I can actually read some of this.
5228720	5233720	Alright. Anyhow, I'm sorry. I didn't mean for President CAT to take over the show, but goddamn.
5233720	5236720	This is cute.
5236720	5242720	O-L-R-0, President CAT 1. Let's just face it. President CAT is the fourth host tonight.
5242720	5247720	Alright. Twitter topics, dammit. Things that don't involve President CAT, believe it or not.
5247720	5250720	Questions when our tweeters give us stuff at O-L-R.
5250720	5255720	Deekman wants me to remind you all, you can now post pictures to the photo stream.
5255720	5259720	So if you send a picture to pics at orangelaungeradio.com,
5259720	5264720	it will now go to our website at www.orangelaungeradio.com,
5264720	5267720	and it'll be right up there for everyone to see.
5267720	5271720	So don't send pictures of penises, or I swear to God, we'll remove this like that.
5271720	5273720	But if you have, like, gaming stuff you want to put,
5273720	5279720	or maybe it's a challenge this week to show our love for President CAT,
5279720	5282720	you need to upload pictures. In fact, who should give a challenge to the listeners every week?
5282720	5283720	I love this idea.
5283720	5286720	Since President CAT has taken over the show tonight,
5286720	5290720	we want people to upload pictures to the stream showing their love for President CAT,
5290720	5294720	because this will help the developers show that they are the next big thing in the U.S.
5294720	5296720	Let's make that happen.
5296720	5302720	Alright. I can't fight the adornment of this. It's too cute.
5302720	5307720	It really is. Like, the podcast listeners who aren't in chat and can't see all these URLs tonight
5307720	5311720	are like, you've got to be smoking crack. But, like, seriously, look at the website.
5311720	5313720	It is cute overload.
5313720	5317720	I hope they don't think that I actually know more Japanese than what I just posted to them.
5317720	5322720	I just said it was funny.
5322720	5325720	Alright. Anyhow, other Twitter topics going on.
5325720	5330720	Oh, shoot. I somehow accidentally clicked on an ad.
5330720	5332720	And now I've got to, oh, man.
5332720	5333720	No.
5333720	5335720	Now I've got to get the stories up again.
5335720	5337720	I'm going to fail.
5337720	5342720	Ryan Belknap wants to know, what do you guys think of Glee and Flash Forward?
5342720	5345720	I love Glee. I think that show is amazing.
5345720	5349720	Flash Forward, I watched the first episode, but wasn't able to watch anything after that.
5349720	5352720	I just haven't had time, because I've been watching a bunch of other shows.
5352720	5355720	My wife watches Glee. I've watched a few episodes of Glee.
5355720	5360720	It's okay. I just, you know, during the week with so much stuff that I'm watching on TV,
5360720	5364720	I try to get time to work on the cabinet and stuff.
5364720	5366720	And I normally skip out on that show.
5366720	5368720	But it's entertaining.
5368720	5373720	And my wife is excited at the fact that they're going to be going on tour.
5373720	5375720	So she wants to go see that.
5375720	5377720	Did that get officially announced?
5377720	5379720	I don't know. I want to see it too if it goes on tour.
5379720	5381720	I'll take your wife if you don't want to go.
5381720	5386720	And then, also, Flash Forward I've actually watched.
5386720	5389720	It's good, but it's slow. That's the only problem.
5389720	5391720	But it is getting interesting.
5391720	5393720	But it is very slow.
5393720	5395720	It's better. But I watch them both.
5395720	5397720	It's by the people who do the 4400.
5397720	5399720	But you know what I haven't been watching, though?
5399720	5401720	And I hear it's actually good this season?
5401720	5402720	Heroes.
5402720	5404720	Really? And I stopped watching it, too.
5404720	5406720	Because I'm watching House. Because House is on the same time.
5406720	5408720	I'm sorry. House wins.
5408720	5411720	Can I say, though, I got introduced to It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia the other day.
5411720	5416720	Oh my god. That show is fucking funny. Oh my god, that show is funny.
5416720	5418720	I've really been, like, kind of...
5418720	5420720	I don't watch that show regularly.
5420720	5424720	We were actually killing time between, like, a show and South Park or something.
5424720	5427720	So we turned it on. I'm like, I forgot how funny this show is.
5427720	5429720	It's just hilarious.
5429720	5432720	And Chat Room reminded me that a couple of people in Chat are saying,
5432720	5434720	Don't forget V starts in a couple weeks.
5434720	5436720	Oh my god!
5436720	5440720	I have two words for you. Fuck yes.
5440720	5442720	No, you don't know how giddy this makes me.
5442720	5445720	You've talked about V, like, five years ago on the show.
5445720	5447720	You've talked about it for a very long time. I know you love V.
5447720	5450720	And you remember when that book came out, how I read the whole thing?
5450720	5451720	Mm-hmm.
5451720	5452720	Like, right here on the show?
5452720	5453720	During the show? Yeah, I know.
5453720	5454720	That book was...
5454720	5456720	I was like, Jamie, time to do the story. What, V?
5456720	5457720	I'm like, fuck you, V.
5457720	5460720	No, that was epic. That was epic.
5460720	5463720	So I'm looking forward to V.
5463720	5464720	Spazinator wants to know,
5464720	5467720	How about the apparent leak by Naughty Dog on the official PS boards
5467720	5471720	regarding cross-game chat coming to the PS3 in Firmware 3.1?
5471720	5474720	Well, you kind of summed it up right there what the news story is,
5474720	5476720	and all I have to say is I hope so.
5476720	5479720	Sadly, as much as I've said nice things about Sony tonight,
5479720	5484720	I think that they're still lagging big time in the online war.
5484720	5487720	But they're free, so I guess you get what you pay for,
5487720	5488720	but this would be nice.
5488720	5489720	It's certainly a nice feature.
5489720	5492720	I mean, of course it would be. Yeah.
5492720	5493720	Let's see.
5493720	5494720	Gamer Girl asks,
5494720	5496720	What's the most fun game you've ever played?
5496720	5500720	Like, so fun that when it's over you'd play it a million times no matter what.
5500720	5503720	Oh, my gosh.
5503720	5507720	I don't know if I want to go like 8-bit or like newer stuff.
5507720	5509720	I can always play the Guardian Legends.
5509720	5511720	You know I talk about that game very fondly on the show,
5511720	5512720	and I love that game.
5512720	5514720	I can always go back to that.
5514720	5517720	If you want to go to a true 80s arcade classic, Dig Dug.
5517720	5518720	I can never stop playing Dig Dug.
5518720	5519720	Peggle.
5519720	5520720	Peggle.
5520720	5521720	Seriously.
5521720	5526720	No, it's like whenever anything happens and I have to wait for anything,
5526720	5527720	I'm like Peggle.
5527720	5529720	Seriously, it's all Peggle for me right now.
5529720	5531720	Mr. Dew.
5531720	5535720	Mr. Dew is Snow Brothers.
5535720	5537720	And soon, President Cat.
5537720	5539720	Mr. Dew is rad.
5539720	5541720	Redertainment asks,
5541720	5543720	I have a big pile of strategy guides I want to get rid of.
5543720	5546720	Suggestions?
5546720	5551720	If you have the versus Final Fantasy 7 one and it still has the poster in it
5551720	5553720	and it's intact, give it to me.
5553720	5555720	Also, winner is coming.
5555720	5557720	Because I don't want to pay $100 for it on eBay.
5557720	5559720	I had that poster, but my drunk girlfriend kicked it
5559720	5562720	and it accidentally ripped.
5562720	5564720	I had the strategy guide and poster and everything
5564720	5568720	and Dan's friend ripped the cover and drew on it.
5568720	5569720	It was a long time ago.
5569720	5570720	I'm pissed off.
5570720	5573720	That particular strategy guide goes for a lot of money on eBay.
5573720	5575720	Seriously.
5575720	5577720	The versus books Final Fantasy 7 one.
5577720	5579720	Rina, we just responded to you, Jamie.
5579720	5580720	Oh, Lord.
5580720	5582720	She's busy tonight.
5582720	5583720	Sorry.
5583720	5585720	It's taking over Twitter tonight.
5585720	5587720	I can't help it.
5587720	5589720	Anyway, that's going to do it for Twitter topics tonight.
5589720	5591720	Sorry if you guys didn't get through.
5591720	5592720	Don't forget, you can always send us an email.
5592720	5594720	Mailbag at OrangeLawnsRadio.com
5594720	5597720	and if you're really upset your tweet didn't get through,
5597720	5601720	blame President Cat because that's been monopolizing our Twitter discussion this evening.
5601720	5602720	I love it.
5602720	5604720	It's got a cat licking its nose.
5604720	5606720	It's so cute.
5606720	5607720	Exactly.
5607720	5609720	How about some other gaming news?
5609720	5611720	Loki.
5611720	5613720	I don't know if I could do any more gaming news.
5613720	5616720	It just feels so insignificant compared to President Cat.
5616720	5618720	But anyways, we'll move on.
5618720	5625720	So apparently people are getting banned for playing pirated copies of Forza and Borderlands.
5625720	5627720	Really?
5627720	5634720	Is that a shock to you that playing games that you've burned early is going to get you banned off Xbox Live?
5634720	5636720	But yeah, that's the case.
5636720	5640720	So apparently if you are going to go the illegal route with Forza Motorsport 3 and Borderlands,
5640720	5642720	you might want to wait until the game comes out.
5642720	5651720	Ironically though, you're going to get banned, but only your live account is going to get banned,
5651720	5654720	not your console because they still want you to buy games apparently.
5654720	5656720	But you can always create a new live account.
5656720	5660720	Or if you're really going to play this that early, just play it offline.
5660720	5663720	Or play it on a banned console.
5663720	5668720	I heard though they banned the account and not the console.
5668720	5669720	Yeah, the account.
5669720	5673720	In some way they knew whether you're playing a legit game or not.
5673720	5679720	I almost picked up Borderlands early too, but I figured I wouldn't get to it because I'd be playing DJ Hero.
5679720	5681720	And that's really what's going to happen.
5681720	5685720	I'm going to wait for Borderlands to come out because I don't know when I'm going to get to it.
5685720	5692720	And really that's the last game I'm buying this year, so I'm all set for the rest of the holiday.
5692720	5698720	I'll just cozy up, no fire, but I'll cozy up in my warm house and DJ Hero and Borderlands.
5698720	5702720	How though, because they say that you're not going to get banned if you have it legitimately,
5702720	5704720	but seriously, how do they know the difference?
5704720	5707720	I don't know.
5707720	5711720	But a lot of people are probably going to be surprised when that fall update rolls around.
5711720	5714720	Everyone playing burned copies of stuff.
5714720	5716720	I hope none of my consoles get banned.
5716720	5717720	Interesting.
5717720	5723720	Of course, ironically enough, and this is kind of off topic, but since I have modded consoles,
5723720	5725720	I'll go ahead and talk about it.
5725720	5730720	It's not even really the fact that they're modded, it's the fact that they're older generation consoles.
5730720	5737720	I've had a 100% failure rate with Xbox 360s, the first generation of them.
5737720	5745720	And I have another one that's dead, or that's going to die, it's freezing up now.
5745720	5748720	And it was actually one that Microsoft repaired.
5748720	5752720	Of course, I went and modded it, so now they can't repair it again.
5752720	5761720	But the new arcade systems, when they have the HDMI ports and stuff on them, those live, sort of.
5761720	5764720	It's just the older ones do not.
5764720	5772720	My sister's console, which I actually have a new one coming for her, the video died on it, which sucks.
5772720	5777720	But the one console though that is dying right now, I'm going to probably take some of the fix.
5777720	5780720	And I'm going to take the other one too, just to see if they can fix that one.
5780720	5783720	Because that's a different error, but we'll see.
5783720	5788720	But god damn it, seriously, talk about crappy hardware.
5788720	5791720	Although I love them.
5791720	5795720	And their console's good, and I will buy another one.
5795720	5797720	Because I'm a sucker like that.
5797720	5801720	Because Grand Theft Auto IV is awesome, and I have to mod it.
5801720	5804720	Well now, I'd be curious to know if Loki's going to buy this.
5804720	5809720	It's something for the Wii that has nothing to do with President Cat, but it does have to do with an exercise bike.
5809720	5814720	Now, I seem to remember on the show a couple weeks ago, we were talking about some type of patent for an exercise bike.
5814720	5818720	Well, it wasn't a patent, it was a leaked, like, advertisement.
5818720	5823720	Well, it looks like this has come to fruition, because Cyberbike Cycling Sports is coming out.
5823720	5826720	But here's the thing, it's not from Nintendo.
5826720	5832720	It's coming from publisher Big Ben, and it comes with a, yes, full-size exercise bike controller.
5832720	5837720	And apparently it's very easy to set up, it has an adjustable saddle, it has handlebars and all this.
5837720	5843720	It's also compatible with Mario Kart Wii, go figure, but the game that comes with it is called Cyberbike.
5843720	5846720	It's supposed to come out in 2010.
5846720	5848720	It looks stupid.
5848720	5854720	Okay, the other one, which looked pretty ridiculous to begin with, you know, had a smaller peripheral.
5854720	5858720	I mean, I could understand maybe having that, because that's a little bit smaller.
5858720	5863720	You know, maybe there's some games that might use it later on, but this is a full fucking exercise bike.
5863720	5870720	You do not need an exercise bike to go with the damn game, just buy an exercise bike if you're gonna buy an exercise bike.
5872720	5878720	Alright, um, moving on, DarkSakura.
5878720	5881720	Oh yes, I'm sorry, I'm still, uh...
5881720	5883720	No, I know, I'm so distracted with the Rina We thing, too.
5883720	5885720	They just, they said something again, to you.
5885720	5886720	To me?
5886720	5889720	I see, I'm a little confused now, many follower in English.
5889720	5891720	Oh, oh, gur, my poor English.
5891720	5898720	I almost feel bad, because they've got to be overwhelmed right now, because Twitter only had like 80 followers, which is fucking criminal.
5898720	5899720	Yeah.
5899720	5905720	And they've already got like 20 new followers throughout the show tonight, and it's probably going to continue to grow as people listen to this podcast.
5905720	5907720	Please go follow them.
5907720	5913720	They are feeling like probably a little overwhelmed at this whole thing, but people need to know, cats are adorable, dammit.
5913720	5914720	I know.
5914720	5916720	So if we're distracted tonight, sorry, this is...
5916720	5923720	If Keyboard Cat can be as popular as it is, if Keyboard Cat can get referenced in Scribblenauts, there is no reason.
5923720	5932720	Okay, if they can put out all these stupid party games that don't sell maybe a thousand copies, you know, they just, they're crappy, crappy, crappy, cheap ass party games.
5932720	5934720	Why the hell can't they port this over?
5934720	5944720	They port all these, you know, UK games that are like, absolutely not popular at all, like these franchises I've never heard of before.
5944720	5947720	And I can't get a goddamn cat playing a fucking piano.
5947720	5952720	Exactly, why can't they put out a cute cat game?
5952720	5959720	Alright, sj100matt in chat, speaking of the last story, says, wait, Mr. Garrison's Wild Wacky Action Bike, the game?
5959720	5965720	No, it's not that kind of peripheral, but I bet with a little duct tape, you can achieve anything.
5965720	5966720	If you want.
5966720	5973720	Question is, Rob, how quick before someone tries to put their penis in it?
5973720	5979720	That is always the quintessential question here on Orange Launch Radio, how quick before someone tries to put their penis in it.
5979720	5988720	And the exercise bike, not long, I mean, I don't know really where you would put your penis, but I'm sure somewhere it'll happen.
5988720	5995720	Alright, anyhow, sorry, Darsakura, we keep interrupting, I know you're trying to correspond with Rina Wee, but there is a show still to be done.
5995720	5999720	I'm just saying, thank you for being patient with us, I wish I knew better Japanese.
5999720	6018720	Well, back to Nintendo, Miyamoto has actually brought back a little bit more conversation in regards to HD Wee, by saying that they want to support new technology as it comes out.
6018720	6027720	And he's actually even saying that if he was a consumer that had an HDTV, he'd want to play his games with nice graphics too.
6027720	6038720	So they're actually going to be moving with it as HD technology becomes more and more prevalent, which really it is, I mean, you know what I mean?
6038720	6063720	But they are pretty adamant that they're going to focus on gameplay, but not close the door on HD. In fact, there's actually some financial analysts already that are saying that it's definitely going to happen this summer.
6063720	6071720	And I think that it's... I don't really know how they're going to do it, other than add-ons, but...
6071720	6079720	Well, I think, you know, we've been saying on this show for some time, the Super Wee or the Wee HD that will be backwards compatible with the original...
6079720	6080720	The Wee Double D!
6080720	6094720	The Wee with four eyes or something, Will, is inevitable. It's going to happen. I think the question is, when? And certainly, you know, summer 2010, I don't need a mega expensive analyst to tell me that.
6094720	6102720	I mean, I think I said that on the show months ago, that it's probably going to happen. Of course, I also called it for this year, so I'm not always right, but this is why I do the show for free.
6102720	6114720	But the one question, we'll let have President Cat. No, but seriously, I mean, Wee HD, is now the time or is everybody just getting over-anxious because Wee HD is what they want?
6114720	6119720	Loki, I'm especially curious to hear from you. I know you're doing other stuff, but I'm kind of curious what you think.
6119720	6125720	I don't want another Wee HD. I'm finding my Wee right now.
6125720	6128720	Is that just because you don't want to spend more money or what's the deal?
6128720	6139720	No, I don't think money is an option. Really, it's just the problem is I'm so jaded by what they've done so far with the Wee. Why do I really want to go through the gamble again?
6139720	6141720	Because tonight we have seen its potential.
6141720	6152720	Listen, OK, I am checking my bank account. Why am I checking my bank account? Because I am buying President Cat. This purchase is imminent, OK? It's happening.
6152720	6162720	I'm buying it, too. I'm buying it, too. I don't even have a thing that can play it, but I'm going to buy it. Why? Because I don't know. Don't fucking judge me. I just want it.
6162720	6167720	I will look at the manual and purr at it or something. I don't know. Someday my Wee will play it.
6167720	6172720	You want to pay for the massage for me? You can get me President Cat.
6172720	6176720	Plus, I oddly want to support this.
6176720	6177720	I do, too.
6177720	6179720	I hope the game doesn't stink.
6179720	6180720	Oh, yeah.
6180720	6187720	I don't care if it stinks or not. The whole fun is going to be the whole novelty.
6187720	6196720	Keep in mind, it's taken me a long time to actually sit and read the blog, just the little comics of the cat, but it's freaking funny.
6196720	6201720	Cat's like, why am I on your t-shirt? Pat, pat, pat.
6201720	6212720	I don't know if you guys heard me laughing earlier. Keep in mind, I probably read on a five-year-old level in Japanese.
6212720	6219720	Which is probably the perfect age of what this game is geared towards, yet we're all sitting here going, eee, cats, eee.
6219720	6221720	You notice who's not in the room.
6221720	6222720	Who?
6222720	6228720	Shermie. Shermie's like, screw all you, I'm gone.
6228720	6234720	Anyhow, Wii HD, I think it's going to happen. It'll be backwards compatible with all the Wii games.
6234720	6238720	It's just a matter of when. We know it. It's a must.
6238720	6241720	Oh, they replied and said, I wish I knew better English, too.
6241720	6245720	Aww. I just want to hug them.
6245720	6249720	You know, I am supposed to go to Japan next year. I should offer to come give her a hug, or him.
6249720	6252720	I don't care. I'll hug them, whoever they are.
6252720	6254720	Anyhow, Loki.
6254720	6256720	Oh, I'm sorry.
6256720	6262720	So, speaking of Xbox 360 updates and possible bannings of people and stuff like that.
6262720	6267720	There is another update that's going to ban stuff, and that will be, of course, the fall update.
6267720	6271720	It will be banning unauthorized memory units.
6271720	6277720	Yes, you may remember we talked a little bit about max memory units being put out by, I believe, Datel.
6277720	6288720	These will allow you to use a micro SD card and support it up to 2GB to 4GB of memory.
6288720	6292720	Which is awesome, because the Microsoft memory units are really fucking expensive.
6292720	6299720	For like $50 or $40, you get a 512MB memory unit, which is ridiculous.
6299720	6306720	Especially since, hell, you can get a USB drive for nothing.
6306720	6312720	So, being the greedy bastards that they are, they decided, hey, you know what?
6312720	6316720	We don't want you to sell this, and so we're going to block it.
6316720	6319720	So if you bought it, you're shit out of luck.
6319720	6322720	And there's nothing you can do about it.
6322720	6325720	But people are pissed, but Microsoft says, who gives a shit?
6325720	6329720	It's our console, we'll do what we want, nah nah nah nah nah.
6329720	6332720	I'm kind of on the fence with this. I think they...
6332720	6334720	They have the right to do it, but it's a dick move.
6334720	6338720	Yeah, it's a cock block move, is what they're doing.
6338720	6343720	And it kind of sucks, because the person who loses here is the consumer.
6343720	6345720	Not the developer of this memory unit.
6345720	6348720	They already made the money from selling it to the consumer.
6348720	6350720	It's the consumer who's shit out of luck.
6350720	6356720	But, if I'm understanding this right, this isn't aimed so much as things that might be in stores.
6356720	6359720	Because there aren't a lot of these unauthorised things in stores.
6359720	6363720	This is aimed at people trying to jerry-rig hard drives to do everything, right?
6363720	6370720	This is aimed at... Well, these devices are aimed at just the consumer, but it's a cheaper alternative with more memory.
6370720	6372720	But it's not being offered by Microsoft.
6372720	6376720	And so, therefore, it goes away.
6376720	6379720	It's the same reason why there's no third-party hard drives.
6379720	6382720	Because, I can tell you this much, hard drives are damn cheap.
6382720	6388720	And especially these drives they're offering for $150, you can get a terabyte drive for $150.
6388720	6394720	So, I guess that's true. Yeah, I think Microsoft does kind of rip off a little bit with their storage.
6394720	6397720	But this is, you know...
6397720	6403720	You know what's really disturbing is the whole wireless adapter.
6403720	6405720	You want to talk about how they really rip people off.
6405720	6409720	I hope they don't block out my wireless adapter just because it's not an official Microsoft one.
6409720	6411720	No, that they can't because it's USB powered.
6411720	6414720	And the wireless adapters, I mean, it's just by Ethernet.
6414720	6419720	They can't block that because it's not USB or... Well, the memory units are technically kind of USB,
6419720	6422720	but it's like some weird setup.
6422720	6425720	So, they can block it by the device ID.
6425720	6427720	Same with controllers if they want to.
6427720	6431720	I think they could block controllers that way too, but they don't.
6431720	6436720	Alright, but the thing is though, when the new 250GB hard drives come out,
6436720	6444720	there are ways out there to make your own hard drive for the 360 by modifying a laptop hard drive.
6444720	6447720	So, if you want to go through the trouble, you can do that for cheaper.
6447720	6450720	And now you can do it up to 250GB.
6450720	6452720	Amazing.
6452720	6455720	Moving on to another story about the Wii.
6455720	6459720	I want to talk about New Super Mario Brothers Wii and the whole demo play.
6459720	6461720	Remember this was very controversial.
6461720	6463720	We've talked about it in an extent on the show.
6463720	6468720	This is the whole, when you pause the game, you can have it play for you to get through certain parts of the game.
6468720	6472720	Well, now details have emerged on how it actually works.
6472720	6474720	So, see what you guys think of this, okay?
6474720	6478720	The mode is actually called Super Guide, okay?
6478720	6482720	And it doesn't really work exactly the way people think it would.
6482720	6487720	What happens is that if you die 8 times on one of the stages, there's 80 stages in the game,
6487720	6493720	if you die 8 times, then what happens is that you'll have a chance to hit a green Super Guide block.
6493720	6497720	What will happen is that then a video is going to show up, Luigi plays through the stage.
6497720	6501720	It's not going to show you hidden paths, it's not going to show you hidden coins,
6501720	6503720	it just kind of shows you how to get through the stage.
6503720	6505720	It will show you how the stage could be completed.
6505720	6509720	At any time, the player can jump in and take over,
6509720	6514720	and then the game basically will have played you through the parts you can't get through.
6514720	6520720	If you want, though, you can just let the game complete the level for you and move on to the next stage.
6520720	6524720	Now, Miyamoto has said there are some disadvantages to using Super Guide.
6524720	6527720	If you decide not to use the Super Guide at all during the game,
6527720	6530720	you stay away from the blocks and don't use them, you get something special.
6530720	6532720	Of course, that could be anything.
6532720	6534720	Could that be something new on the title screen?
6534720	6536720	Could it be an unlockable character?
6536720	6537720	Who knows what that could be.
6537720	6539720	But if you rely on them, you're going to miss out.
6539720	6545720	And, of course, just the whole morale of the fact you had to use the Super Guide to beat the level.
6545720	6551720	A quote from Miyamoto in a little article that is running on Destructoid right now,
6551720	6554720	I find that when the Super Guide block does appear,
6554720	6557720	I kind of feel regretful and guilty that I've let that happen.
6557720	6559720	So I've often found that playing the game, when that happens,
6559720	6561720	it kind of inspires me to say,
6561720	6564720	I've already done this bad, now I have to clear the level on my own.
6564720	6569720	So, you know, I guess they're saying that you just feel a general sense of,
6569720	6572720	well, you cheated to beat the level in order to actually get through it.
6572720	6575720	So, I don't know, what do you guys think?
6575720	6577720	Now that you hear the details on how this actually works,
6577720	6581720	that it's a brick that appears if you die eight times, what do you think?
6581720	6584720	Is it still a joke? Is it useful?
6584720	6589720	It's got a use for it, but, you know, at the same time, it's kind of, I don't know.
6589720	6593720	I've stopped caring, basically, I think is what it is.
6593720	6596720	It's like, it was fun to complain about and stuff like that a while ago,
6596720	6602720	but they've just hired me out, so I just don't care anymore.
6602720	6606720	And on top of that, I'll have you know that I've already placed my order for President Cat,
6606720	6607720	which will be here shortly after-
6607720	6608720	High five! High five!
6608720	6610720	Shortly after street date, yes.
6610720	6614720	To play on my modded Wii that will take games from any region.
6614720	6616720	That means we need the camera next week.
6616720	6621720	I just sent them a message saying, you know, that I'm one of the hosts
6621720	6625720	and that I have a friend that speaks Japanese who I can probably get to translate for us.
6625720	6629720	So, we've got several friends in Japan. We've got several listeners in Japan.
6629720	6633720	See if she could write a story for our website.
6633720	6636720	Like, just an interview. Interview them for a story on the website or something.
6636720	6637720	I'll talk to her.
6637720	6641720	Yeah, please do. I don't know if that would interest her at all, but that would be amazing.
6641720	6642720	All right.
6642720	6643720	President Cat!
6643720	6647720	Let's get some comments from our chat room.
6647720	6652720	Let's see. Gameguru says, problem with Wii HD coming out before the next Xbox or Playstation
6652720	6656720	is that it won't be graphically on par with them and won't initially have the Wii's fan base.
6656720	6660720	That's going back to a previous news story, but that's okay because I know there's a little delay.
6660720	6664720	XLink calls this Super Cheater 5000 is the name of the device.
6664720	6667720	You know, again, I think we have to remember the audience this is aimed at.
6667720	6674720	And I think for the casual player, this is, you know, going to be a good thing.
6674720	6675720	But I think for the rest of us,
6675720	6680720	I do really like the fact that you at least get some unlockable if you don't do it.
6680720	6684720	I just hope that unlockable carries some weight a little bit.
6684720	6687720	You know, unfortunately, Wii doesn't have anything like achievements,
6687720	6692720	so hopefully it'll have some type of E-peen that you can show other people
6692720	6695720	because who doesn't like to stroke their E-peen?
6695720	6697720	DarkSakura, don't you love to stroke your E-peen?
6697720	6698720	Yeah.
6698720	6701720	All right. One way DarkSakura likes to stroke her E-peen is every week she'll open up the mailbag
6701720	6705720	and read some emails from our listeners at mailbagatorangelaungeradio.com.
6705720	6709720	So DarkSakura, please open up the mailbag.
6709720	6711720	There wasn't very much when I looked in there earlier, but maybe there is now.
6711720	6712720	There's one.
6712720	6713720	One email.
6713720	6714720	From J-Rod.
6714720	6717720	All right. Well, let's read it tonight in tonight's mailbag segment.
6717720	6721720	And we'll just have to roll anything that comes in now to next week.
6721720	6722720	President Cat.
6722720	6725720	I anticipate we're going to have a lot of President Cat emails this week, but we'll see.
6725720	6727720	Hello, OLR crew.
6727720	6733720	I currently listen to the latest podcast on the feed where Rob and Loki completely trash the PSP Go.
6733720	6740720	What everyone who bad mouths the PSP Go needs to realize is that maybe the PSP Go is supposed to be a new PSP owner purchase and not an upgrade.
6740720	6747720	I never had a PSP before, but seeing all the stuff on PSN and the new PSP Go pushed me over the edge to get one finally.
6747720	6751720	It is a sleek portable, and the sliding screen looks cool as hell.
6751720	6760720	Now, if I owned an older PSP, of course I wouldn't buy the PSP Go the same way I wouldn't buy a DSi if I owned a Lite or a Phat.
6760720	6766720	I honestly don't think the PSP Go is even aimed at the current PSP owners, but new customers like myself.
6766720	6770720	So really, no need to take a shit on it. Just don't buy it and enjoy your current PSPs.
6770720	6774720	This email sponsored by the Olive Garden, home of the River Reading Salad and Breadsticks.
6774720	6776720	Um, I will say this.
6776720	6777720	And this is me.
6777720	6779720	Okay, this is just me.
6779720	6793720	If I was a new customer, and I was told to pick one to buy, if they were all the same price, I would pick the 3,000.
6793720	6795720	I wouldn't get a Go.
6795720	6799720	And we've said on this show that the PSP 3,000 is a great system. It's pretty cool.
6799720	6803720	And the thing is, I don't understand why you would pay more money for a system that does less, basically.
6803720	6805720	That's my question.
6805720	6810720	I'm not even talking about people that own a PlayStation Portable already, because there's no reason they need another system.
6810720	6812720	I don't understand that at all, why would you buy another one.
6812720	6820720	Why I said that, because I actually have two PSPs, but the 2,000 actually had a little bit more RAM and stuff like that, and it was a little bit different.
6820720	6824720	The 3,000 has a built-in microphone and whatnot, so that's alright.
6824720	6829720	But, the fact is, the 3,000 is cheaper.
6829720	6831720	It plays the same downloadable games.
6831720	6835720	Plus, you have the option now to purchase games that are on UMD.
6835720	6839720	Plus, you can get memory units and stuff like that for it.
6839720	6841720	Yes, it doesn't have built-in memory, but you know what?
6841720	6847720	Memory is cheap, so it's not really worth paying the extra money for memory that's in the system.
6847720	6853720	And that sliding screen may look cool and stuff, but at the same time, I'm wondering how soon that's going to break.
6853720	6863720	I do give them credit for the fact that they have the ability to sync up your DualShock 3 controller with it to play games when you have it hooked up to your TV.
6863720	6869720	I can't say that I've actually used that function on my PSP 2,000.
6869720	6875720	I mean, I've played games on TV before, but maybe once or twice to see it and check it out.
6875720	6880720	I don't understand why you would pay more money for a system that does less.
6880720	6882720	That's basically my argument.
6882720	6890720	But hey, if you want to, and if you think it's a cool-looking system or whatever, more power to you.
6890720	6892720	I got to try one.
6892720	6897720	A guy in my art history class had one.
6897720	6902720	Well, I didn't really sit and play on anything, but he let me hold it and push the buttons.
6902720	6905720	And I have to say that it really felt flimsy.
6905720	6908720	It felt really cheap.
6908720	6913720	My iPhone weighs more, and of course I have an old iPhone, but it weighs more than the PSP Go.
6913720	6916720	And the plastic just felt like poor quality.
6916720	6922720	I just really felt like if I had a moment of frustration and gripped it too tightly that I would break it.
6922720	6926720	I really had the feeling that it was fragile.
6926720	6931720	I want to take a quick poll in here because I want to kind of address the Sony people for a minute.
6931720	6935720	Because especially in reading some of the reviews on Twitter and so forth.
6935720	6939720	I'm sorry, not Twitter. Twitter's on my mind tonight because of everything else going on.
6939720	6941720	But on iTunes and everything.
6941720	6945720	People have been unnecessarily harsh to our program because they think we're slanted against Sony.
6945720	6948720	And I want to make it very clear, it's not the case.
6948720	6950720	We haze people when they deserve to be hazed.
6950720	6952720	And I want to prove that here with something.
6952720	6957720	And I'm not saying this particular emailer is a part of that because I know he's emailed us a bunch about various topics.
6957720	6960720	But I'm just saying, hold on a minute, because it works both ways here.
6960720	6962720	Quick poll of the room.
6962720	6966720	How many of you own a DSi?
6966720	6969720	No. I don't. I don't. Exactly.
6969720	6971720	None of us own a DSi either.
6971720	6973720	And for many of the same reasons.
6973720	6976720	Because what's the difference between a DS and a DSi?
6976720	6978720	It has a camera. It has a camera.
6978720	6981720	I'll get a DSi when there are more specific DSi games.
6981720	6985720	But other than that, there's no legitimate reason for me to have a DSi.
6985720	6989720	It's got a camera with it and the price points are pretty similar.
6989720	6993720	But at the same time, it doesn't warrant me purchasing another system that plays the same games, basically.
6993720	6997720	They put out a camera on the old Game Boy Color.
6997720	6999720	Guess who didn't buy one? Me.
6999720	7001720	Eddie is saying two cameras.
7001720	7003720	But here's something else to consider.
7003720	7006720	If I remember right, the DSi got rid of the Game Boy Advance slot, too.
7006720	7007720	Exactly.
7007720	7008720	So you can't play games.
7008720	7009720	Less functionality.
7009720	7014720	So it's, in a way, almost just as bad as the PSP Go and the PSP 3000.
7014720	7017720	Here's my question that is not really being answered.
7017720	7024720	What do you get with the PSP Go that you don't get on the PSP 3000 that justifies the increased price?
7024720	7034720	At least in the DS world, you can say a camera, the downloadable game service, and the SD card support.
7034720	7036720	Okay, fair enough. So you've named a couple things that you would with a DS.
7036720	7038720	And I even knocked on that.
7038720	7040720	It's not enough for me.
7040720	7041720	For me.
7041720	7045720	But for a new player, okay, now you have to weigh the pros and the cons.
7045720	7047720	I don't get to play Game Boy Advance games anymore.
7047720	7050720	Pros. I get a camera, SD card slot, and downloadable games.
7050720	7051720	What do I want to do?
7051720	7055720	But with the PSP 3000 and the PSP Go, you have to weigh.
7055720	7059720	Con. It's more expensive and I lose the UMD.
7059720	7061720	Pro.
7061720	7062720	Chirp chirp.
7062720	7063720	It's cuter.
7063720	7067720	It's sleeker looking and it's got Bluetooth support.
7067720	7068720	So?
7068720	7069720	That's it.
7069720	7079720	And with the DSi even, if you are purchasing a new system, you're probably not going to be able to buy any Game Boy Advance games anyways out there because they're not selling them anymore.
7079720	7081720	They haven't been selling them for a few years now.
7081720	7090720	So it's not going to be that big a deal if you can't have a Game Boy Advance slot on there to people that are just getting into the DS or whatever.
7090720	7092720	And the DSi would be a good purchase for them.
7092720	7100720	But if you have Game Boy Advance games and you have a DS, why would you go and buy another game system?
7100720	7107720	I'm glad to know it's not just us tonight because there's a little bit of DSi rabble rabble going on in chat as well, but there is some comments.
7107720	7113720	SSJ100Matt says, aside from them putting President Cat on DSi, I never see myself getting a DSi.
7113720	7117720	And ActDef says, Matt indeed, President Cat on the DSi and I'll buy it instantly.
7117720	7120720	Which, by the way, I want to say, how fucking adorable is this?
7120720	7127720	ActDef tweeted the Reno-y people to say, hey, I'm in Mexico. It's not just USA people. I'm in Mexico and I think you're great.
7127720	7134720	And they responded, gracias. How adorable. I want to hug them all. I do.
7134720	7136720	I want President Cat.
7136720	7138720	Aren't you going to be traveling to Japan?
7138720	7143720	I'm supposed to travel to Japan in June, yes. In fact, I will be gone from the show for two or three weeks.
7143720	7145720	Take me with you.
7145720	7148720	You got money? I'm going on a tour type thing, so we'll see.
7148720	7149720	Okay.
7149720	7155720	But, yeah, I'm excited about that. More details on that next year.
7155720	7157720	I may have to miss E3 because of it. We'll see.
7157720	7160720	Rob, I have to teach you how to shop.
7160720	7165720	I know. I'm not going to know anything. That's why I won't go to a foreign country if it's not in a tour.
7165720	7167720	I'm going to teach you how to shop.
7167720	7168720	All right.
7168720	7170720	And ask for directions.
7170720	7171720	Teach me five-year-old Japanese.
7171720	7173720	I will teach you five-year-old Japanese.
7173720	7175720	Hey, I know five-year-old Japanese.
7175720	7180720	All right. So, anyway, if you want more e-mails, mailbag at orangelaungeradio.com.
7180720	7185720	Loki, we... Oh, I'm sorry. Before we get into that, I'm just all off tonight.
7185720	7187720	It's all right. It's President Cat.
7187720	7191720	It's not even just President Cat. You know what started it all?
7191720	7194720	Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do.
7194720	7196720	Oh, yeah.
7196720	7205720	You thought I forgot about that, didn't you?
7205720	7209720	It's official. Dark Sakura is in the corner crying.
7209720	7216720	I was not. I got you. And I flipped Rob off a lot.
7216720	7219720	This is just one of those shows. You know, I was driving here tonight thinking,
7219720	7221720	God, I'm tired. This is just going to be a crappy show tonight.
7221720	7222720	My headache spun away.
7222720	7223720	Yeah, no, this is great.
7223720	7224720	Seriously.
7224720	7229720	But I swear to God, if you make me sick, not even President Cat can help you where you're going to go.
7229720	7231720	President Cat.
7233720	7234720	Anyhow.
7234720	7237720	Rob, you know what I have? I have a case of meh.
7237720	7242720	Leo Shannon Chat says, Rob, I made that my new iPhone ringtone. Awesome.
7242720	7245720	DJ Dark Knight says, Flying shoe coming up, lol.
7245720	7248720	And X-Link says, I was also in the corner crying.
7248720	7252720	Those comments from our lovely chat room, chat.orangelaungeradio.com.
7252720	7256720	All right, well, maybe for those of you that are sick and tired of Daytona, this segment is just for you.
7256720	7258720	It's the FUs of the Week.
7273720	7279720	All right, so starting off tonight, the story that inspired our FUs of the Week.
7279720	7283720	Apparently, a 15-year-old was set on fire this week.
7283720	7284720	And that's not cool.
7284720	7291720	You know, as much as we joke about fire, fire is to look at on the Indiana Jones ride and yell cool at or fuego.
7291720	7293720	You don't actually set people on fire.
7293720	7295720	That is not cool.
7295720	7299720	And unfortunately, this poor kid, Michael Brewer, was set on fire.
7299720	7308720	And the reason why, because Brewer owed one of the suspects who's been arrested US $40 for a video game.
7308720	7313720	This video game debt apparently made the suspect steal the father's bicycle.
7313720	7315720	Brewer reported the bicycle was stolen.
7315720	7320720	The suspect got arrested, but the suspect was released from a detention center on Monday morning.
7320720	7323720	And then Brewer was waiting for friends in an apartment complex.
7323720	7328720	The suspect, I guess, came up saying he's a snitch, a snitch, and poured on him.
7328720	7331720	And they poured alcohol and lighter and, yeah, gross.
7331720	7334720	So, I mean, just, what a monster.
7334720	7335720	What an ass.
7335720	7337720	And over a video game debt.
7337720	7343720	And it commented, prompted one sheriff to say in 31 years it's the most heinous crime I've ever seen.
7343720	7346720	All over $40 over a video game.
7346720	7350720	FU suspect whose name they clearly haven't released because he's a minor.
7350720	7353720	But they should so we can dedicate this segment to him.
7353720	7355720	Dark Soccer, do you have any FUs of the week?
7355720	7361720	I'm actually just trying to verify that I was reading this properly because they asked us what President Katz is.
7361720	7363720	So I was going to say doesn't that mean president?
7363720	7365720	Anyway, I'm about to say.
7365720	7372720	But, yeah, FU to my coworker who I refer to all the time as Mr. Annoying.
7372720	7377720	For, I took a five year old baby in tattletaling on something that didn't involve him.
7377720	7380720	Logie, do you have any FUs of the week?
7380720	7383720	My FU of the week goes to pushy salesmen.
7383720	7386720	Especially people that come door to door selling stuff.
7386720	7390720	Because I'm always a sucker at opening the door and I really shouldn't.
7390720	7395720	So we had a guy that we were looking for roof quotes because we need a new roof on our house.
7395720	7401720	And this guy came and gave us this sales pitch that took two hours.
7401720	7408720	And, well, he was really pushy and annoying so it sucked.
7408720	7412720	And if I hadn't answered the door I wouldn't have to deal with it.
7412720	7417720	So FU that because I hate these people.
7417720	7425720	My FU of the week just goes to, gosh, tonight I've laughed so hard I'm actually not that angsty.
7425720	7429720	I guess my FU goes to drama.
7429720	7430720	Drama.
7430720	7431720	In general.
7431720	7436720	Although, honestly, you know, things are okay. I can't complain too much.
7436720	7438720	Everything's better with President Cat.
7438720	7442720	It really is. Although now we're finding out when the official people are saying what's President Cat.
7442720	7444720	Clearly that is not the name of the game.
7444720	7447720	So I just tweeted him, do you have a better translation?
7447720	7454720	I see that. Well, that's what I copied the actual kanji over because, was it sensual?
7454720	7462720	It's like, for example, there's a different word that's similar that means like class president when you're in school.
7462720	7466720	And so and so president. It's a different type of position.
7466720	7470720	And president would be the closest equivalent.
7470720	7472720	I still think that's a cool name for a game, President Cat.
7472720	7477720	I mean, even if that's not the translation, wouldn't that be awesome if we just named the game?
7477720	7479720	I think it would be like company president.
7479720	7481720	And you could do it. Okay. Get this. Follow me with this.
7481720	7487720	You could do it in the style, have the cat like kind of looking up in the sky, doing the style of Obama.
7487720	7492720	And that would be so the Obama poster. That would be awesome.
7492720	7494720	That could be the cover of the game.
7494720	7497720	We're going to make that the website. I'm telling you.
7497720	7503720	We're going to do it. I can't stress this enough. Please upload your your President Cat or whatever the hell this game is called.
7503720	7506720	Your fan art, your whatever.
7506720	7512720	Put it on the OLR picks thing and then tweet it to this poor girl who doesn't know what the hell she just woke up to today.
7512720	7514720	Here. And show them the love.
7514720	7516720	The cat, Renna is the cat's name.
7516720	7519720	Okay. Okay. I got the Renna part. Okay.
7519720	7525720	And Sancho, Shacho would be, I guess, like company president.
7525720	7527720	Just call it Obama cat and be done with it.
7527720	7529720	The game will sell millions of copies.
7529720	7534720	Now, it'll be on Fox News about how it brainwashes kids and will laugh.
7534720	7539720	The one Sukeban I think has to do with.
7539720	7545720	I think it means something about female something.
7545720	7552720	I don't know. I think Dark Tetsuya says top cat.
7552720	7555720	Oh, God, like top chef, top cat. I'd love that.
7555720	7559720	All right. Anyhow, let's move on with a couple more stories.
7559720	7561720	Sukeban means delinquent girl.
7561720	7563720	Interesting.
7563720	7564720	Or boss girl.
7564720	7567720	So is the game like naughty cat? Oh, that would be amazing.
7567720	7577720	So, well, I knew that has something to do with the girl because it's like I know characters who've been in series that have like Sukeban Dekka.
7577720	7586720	It has to do with like a delinquent girl who uses a yo-yo as a weapon or like a female gang leader, you know, for a school gang, you know.
7586720	7595720	So I'm guessing it's sort of like female boss cat Renna or female boss Renna.
7595720	7597720	Cat's not actually in the name.
7597720	7598720	Interesting.
7598720	7599720	So.
7599720	7604720	All right. Well, if they should download the show and listen to it, just know we've decided that that should be the name of the game.
7604720	7608720	All right. Anyhow, a couple more news stories for you.
7608720	7612720	And then the Skype line to say your piece on anything about tonight.
7612720	7617720	What says something on Twitter said that means boss cat boss.
7617720	7622720	Thank you. Akuma J.P. I'm so glad he's still listening, even though Justin TV hasn't been around for a while.
7622720	7625720	He's like the ambassador we need right now.
7625720	7631720	Plus, did you notice his little icon is him looking up just like Obama would.
7631720	7634720	Thank you, Akuma J.P. All right.
7634720	7645720	Let's get to a couple more stories and then we'll get to the Skype line at 1877 Game OLR for some stories.
7645720	7647720	Let's talk something else about.
7647720	7648720	Let's see.
7648720	7654720	We've got the possibility of a new DS on the horizon, which is interesting.
7654720	7665720	There's a rumor that the new Nvidia Tegra chip is going into the next generation DS system, seeing as it just did the DSi.
7665720	7666720	Whatever.
7666720	7668720	Guess you get to buy DS again.
7668720	7676720	And it's interesting because apparently it's going to be similar to the one that's like in the Zune HD.
7676720	7684720	And what's interesting though is it's got a really high clock speed compared to what the DSi is right now.
7684720	7694720	Because the Tegra APX has a clock speed of 600 MHz, whereas the DS cores right now run at 67 and 33 MHz.
7694720	7701720	And they believe that there's a potential that it could be GeForce 9-based hardware.
7701720	7707720	And if it's cheap enough, Nintendo might consider it their next DS system, possibly an announcement.
7707720	7709720	Maybe in another E3.
7709720	7712720	Maybe not next year, but the year after.
7712720	7713720	I don't know.
7713720	7714720	It's interesting.
7714720	7720720	It'd be interesting to see them being on the cutting edge of portable systems since their systems usually kind of...
7720720	7721720	I don't know.
7721720	7722720	Well, let's see.
7722720	7726720	I mean, the last system was emulating like Nintendo 64 games.
7726720	7729720	So this next handheld system should be like a GameCube in my pocket.
7729720	7730720	Yeah.
7730720	7731720	It's interesting.
7731720	7732720	Oh, President Cat.
7732720	7733720	Wait, would you say it?
7733720	7739720	They just posted again to all of us saying, really, I can't believe it, kind people, I'm impressed.
7739720	7742720	And great name, thank you.
7742720	7744720	So they like President Cat.
7744720	7746720	I like it too.
7746720	7748720	Chat room, quick poll.
7748720	7749720	Lost Cat or President Cat?
7749720	7752720	Who would buy a game called President Cat?
7752720	7757720	And as soon as that game comes, I'm taking a picture of my cat holding the game.
7757720	7761720	I'm going to take a picture of Shermie with it too.
7761720	7766720	I'm telling you, we are going to flood these people with USA love because what we're doing...
7766720	7774720	This poor guy does not know what they're in for because we're going to flood them with this stuff so they can take it to their people and say,
7774720	7778720	look, the US is crazy about President Cat.
7778720	7779720	We need to get them.
7779720	7786720	And then they'll be like, what's President Cat?
7786720	7789720	This is the show is the win.
7789720	7792720	Rob, when you put this show up, subtitle it President Cat.
7792720	7794720	I'm not even going to put a description.
7794720	7798720	I'm going to say, sorry, this show was dominated by President Cat or something.
7798720	7803720	Anyhow, let's see, quick response to our poll in chat room.
7803720	7815720	Do want, arrow pointing at name, I would, yo, I will, stuff on my President Cat, I would, now, ten copies, I would, my cat wants it, I will buy a hundred copies.
7815720	7818720	Nove Dea is buying copies for her cats.
7818720	7822720	I haven't even played my Wii in over a year, but if I can get this game, I'll break that trend.
7822720	7831720	And my favorite from M.A. Satsuma, President Cat is purrfect.
7831720	7832720	That's beautiful.
7832720	7842720	I knew what I'm just hoping though is that I'm hoping that at least this game isn't all like written that there's like vocal track with it because then I could play it.
7842720	7846720	Because I read like, seriously, I read like a five year old.
7846720	7848720	I know my numbers in a few other countries.
7848720	7849720	I just love the action.
7849720	7851720	I'm just worried the game sucks.
7851720	7853720	I don't care at this point.
7853720	7855720	I don't care.
7855720	7857720	It doesn't matter.
7857720	7859720	How can this?
7859720	7861720	Uh oh, what?
7861720	7873720	Uh, pod culture, Brad just became Rina Wee's 100th follower. We doubled their followership.
7873720	7875720	I love this show.
7875720	7877720	Some days I hate it, today I love it.
7877720	7882720	I mean seriously, okay, Wii music was put out by Nintendo.
7882720	7885720	Sucked balls.
7885720	7886720	Why?
7886720	7889720	Because it did not have a cat playing the piano.
7889720	7891720	And I'm sorry, it doesn't matter.
7891720	7893720	The game is going to be awesome.
7893720	7902720	And yes, I understand it's no Metroid Prime, it's no Conduit or whatever, it's not even a Super Mario Galaxy, but you know what?
7902720	7906720	It's a motherfucking cat playing a motherfucking piano, what else do you need?
7906720	7914720	They have games out there based on like Moomin, which is like some, I don't even know what it is, it's some character from Europe somewhere.
7914720	7919720	It's just, then we need this game. I'm sorry, we need this game.
7919720	7922720	I agree, we need it. We need it.
7922720	7929720	Alright, anyhow, one more story for you guys, then we're going to open up the Skypline and I can't wait to get to the calls tonight.
7929720	7933720	Castlevania, the Adventure Rebirth, more information has been announced.
7933720	7935720	This is a game, of course, heading to WiiWare.
7935720	7943720	It's been a Wii heavy show, we haven't had a lot of Nintendo news in a long time, but yes, of course, Castlevania Adventure Rebirth, this was one of the games that was spoiled from the ESRB database.
7943720	7950720	It is true, Konami hasn't really announced it, but we know it's true because you know what, it showed up in a magazine this week in Japan.
7950720	7958720	It's coming out October 27th for a thousand Wii points, and hopefully it's going to come here in time, maybe for Halloween, that's what they're thinking at this point is coming out in Japan.
7958720	7959720	It looks sexy.
7959720	7960720	It looks very sexy.
7960720	7964720	It's a Game Boy game originally, but they just completely remade it, it's now in color.
7964720	7974720	It looks a little more, to me, like the 16-bit era, like it looks like the Castlevania 4, Super Castlevania 4, but like, I don't know, this is going to be cool.
7974720	7985720	It will have new arrangements of classic Castlevania music, yes, and like the other Rebirth games that they did, they are going for a faithful 16-bit look.
7985720	7988720	What are you screaming laughing about there, over there, DarkSakura?
7988720	7997720	I'm just looking at all of the last 50 followers of Reno E, and it's all of us.
7997720	7998720	I love it, I love it.
7998720	8002720	Anyhow, can we move on?
8002720	8004720	I'm sorry, this is fantastic.
8004720	8006720	No, it's funny.
8006720	8012720	Tonight has just been a very special show, and it's about to get more special-er, as if there was such a thing.
8012720	8018720	1877 Game OLR is the Skype line, or our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.
8018720	8021720	Let's get to the calls. Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio, who's this?
8021720	8024720	This is DS Master 26.
8024720	8029720	DS Master, we're asking everybody tonight, President Cat, is it awesome, are we overdoing it?
8029720	8030720	Yes, I would buy it.
8030720	8033720	I would too. Alright, what's on your mind tonight?
8033720	8037720	Oh shit, Skype crashed again.
8037720	8039720	Son of a bitch.
8039720	8042720	Skype did that last week too, didn't it?
8042720	8044720	Bad Skype.
8044720	8055720	Alright, well, this is when, this is one of those rare cases where we will actually call somebody back, because he did get through fair and square, so we're gonna call him.
8055720	8058720	I don't know what the hell, Skype did this last week too, remember?
8058720	8060720	It's just being retarded.
8060720	8066720	Tigerclaw asked if I've updated it, you know what, I probably haven't, especially not tonight, because we ran in studio very late tonight.
8066720	8068720	Hi, DS Master, are you back?
8068720	8072720	Yeah, sorry, I think it's something with my PSP 2000 here.
8072720	8073720	No, no, it's us.
8073720	8075720	I'm gonna try to log into my 3000 call you.
8075720	8078720	Hello? DS Master, it's us, Skype crashed on our end.
8078720	8079720	Um, what's on your mind?
8079720	8080720	Oh, it's your end?
8080720	8082720	Yeah, it was our end. What's on your mind tonight?
8082720	8089720	Um, not much, other than I will buy President Cat when it comes out.
8089720	8099720	Other than that, um, I'm here to review, my friend got an early copy of Sixteen Empress.
8099720	8100720	Please go for it.
8100720	8102720	It's epic.
8102720	8109720	Tell us a little bit about the game for those that don't know, because remember not everybody that listens to this show is from the Bamani days.
8109720	8122720	Well, we were kind of thinking since this is going to be the last BeatMania for PS2, we might as well get it. And of course I don't have the phone of cash lying around, so uh, you know, my friend bought it.
8122720	8128720	And so, you know, he showed me some videos and whatever, and I thought this was kind of cool.
8128720	8142720	And now with DJ Hero coming out, the question is, is that going to, you know, is that going to be the competition in Konami to run for their money along with Scratch DJ?
8142720	8153720	Do you think this is going to, you know, blow off the BeatMania fans to go get the DJ Heroes and Scratch games for the world?
8153720	8160720	Well, let's not forget these games aren't here in the U.S. I mean, those that are buying this game are not supporting anything in the U.S.
8160720	8167720	You're supporting Konami of Japan, but you're not really supporting anything here, and I don't believe DJ Hero is out in Japan anytime soon. Right, Loki? Do you know?
8167720	8168720	I don't know.
8168720	8169720	I don't think it would be anytime soon.
8169720	8170720	Probably not.
8170720	8176720	So the two games really aren't competing against each other. I know a lot of the Bamani community wants to think it is, but they're really not.
8176720	8186720	Because we all know that DJ Hero will come out in Japan soon, because Guitar Hero is out in Japan, I mean, as far as the On Tour games, as far as I know.
8186720	8188720	That would be true. I'll give you that.
8188720	8196720	And some of me thinking, this is the competition for the Guitar Freaks, Drummanias, and especially with Rockman out there now, too.
8196720	8206720	So, Konami tried Rock Revolution, that was a crap shame, as we all know. And this, I think, may be their final nail in the coffin.
8206720	8218720	It doesn't say when it's going to be out over there, but it says October 2009 is the release date for DJ Hero over there, so it very well could be coming out around the same time, although, I don't know.
8218720	8223720	Alright, well, DS Master, do you have anything else, quickly, before we let you go?
8223720	8235720	Um, other than to say, I give Sixteen Empress, you know, since I'm a factor, it's probably the last beatme for the PS2, because I'm waiting for a PS3 launch before I actually buy one of those consoles.
8235720	8242720	Um, I, it's, in the point of President Cat, it's purrrrfect.
8242720	8250720	It is purrrfect, and Skype just crashed again, so if you can hear me, Skype crashed again.
8250720	8256720	I don't know what the hell is going on tonight, but Skype crashed again, so sorry to DS Master 26, but at least he got his thoughts out.
8256720	8259720	So, live radio, unfortunately, this kind of stuff is going to happen.
8259720	8260720	We got another reply from Rina Wee.
8260720	8261720	What happened now?
8261720	8263720	It says she has a bit of the queen type.
8263720	8265720	So maybe it's Queen Cat?
8265720	8266720	Queen Cat.
8266720	8269720	I don't know if Queen Cat, I think President Cat has a better ring to it.
8269720	8270720	Boss Cat.
8270720	8271720	Or Boss Cat?
8271720	8273720	The boss of the cats in the house.
8273720	8280720	Almost like Top Cat. But if you saw these games on the shelf, which one would jump out to you? I think President Cat would jump out to you.
8280720	8282720	That shows a little bit of the US flair to it, right?
8282720	8283720	Mmm.
8283720	8286720	Because in Japan, they don't have a president, they have a prime minister, correct?
8286720	8293720	Yeah, but I think that when it comes to representing the game, you're not actually being a president president, but, you know. Anyway.
8293720	8296720	Alright, let's go to another call. Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this?
8296720	8299720	Hi, this is Ray Ayanami.
8299720	8303720	Hi, Ray Ayanami. Hey, quickly, we're polling all of our callers tonight.
8303720	8309720	If President Cat was released in the US, would you buy it, or do we need to shut the hell up?
8309720	8311720	Um, sorry, why the hell not?
8311720	8315720	Have you not been listening to the show tonight?
8315720	8321720	I have been, I just didn't go to a gentle party, since I was busy with homework and such.
8321720	8326720	Oh, okay, well then we'll give you a buy. Well, what's on your mind tonight?
8326720	8332720	So, I've been looking at the 2D shooters, like, this decade, and I've been noticing a recent trend.
8332720	8338720	Like, they need to have, like, a bullet hell shooter with lots of cutesy anime characters.
8338720	8343720	And it's kind of getting me worried about the 2D shooter genre.
8343720	8345720	Mm-hmm.
8345720	8365720	This means that, like, more traditional shooters with starships made out of characters are being phased out, and I have friends who are mostly into stuff like Toho, and Psych Witches, and Death Moth, and all the other...
8365720	8367720	...Moet, Moet shooters.
8367720	8373720	And I was feeling that if I were to show them something like archives or something of the force, they'd probably say no.
8373720	8389720	And one offer, them playing whatever they want, it makes you realize, in the future, it's all we're ever going to see of shooters, and it'd be nothing but cutesy bullet hell shooters that are all, like, cropping topics of each other.
8389720	8396720	Let's say you were a game designer. What would you do to make a 2D shooter interesting?
8396720	8413720	Mm-hmm. Interesting is in, like, for people to, like, make a shooter that was more of the aforementioned traditional shooter, like, how to make it more interesting.
8413720	8416720	I'm sorry, I missed that. What?
8416720	8423720	Wait, what do you mean by how to make a shooter interesting is how to design a shooter?
8423720	8433720	Like, because, you know, you kind of are saying that a lot of the games are kind of copies of each other, so what would you do to kind of break the mold?
8433720	8456720	Well, because as I mentioned, I want to make more shooters that are, like, they don't have lots of worlds, but it's something that makes the game challenging to other than really pretty board patterns, like, kind of more of a sort of more traditional shooter, like Gradius Rebirth.
8456720	8465720	Gradius Rebirth is pretty cool. I like these Rebirth series that Konami is doing recently. Did you just hear us talking about Castlevania Rebirth?
8465720	8467720	Yeah, I did.
8467720	8472720	What do you think of that? Is that going to be interesting? I know it's not a shooter, but I figure you're a fan of that series, too.
8472720	8492720	Yeah, I'm a Castlevania fan, too. I've played most of the Metroidvania and some of the older Castlevania games, but I'm going to give it a shot. It depends on what elements it decides to borrow from past games.
8492720	8503720	All right. Well, we're going to let you go, buddy, so we can get some more calls, but do yourself a favor. Listen to Part A tonight, because we're just crazy tonight, all right? Take care, buddy.
8503720	8512720	1-877-GAME-OLR, username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio. We're going to take your calls right now, and of course we are polling all the callers tonight about President and Cat.
8512720	8515720	Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this?
8515720	8517720	Hi, this is Spazinator.
8517720	8519720	Hey, Spazinator. How you doing?
8519720	8524720	Oh, pretty good, Huck. How's everything over in President Cantland?
8524720	8531720	Yes, wonderful, and we have to ask you, are you interested in buying President and Cat, or are we making too big of a deal out of it?
8531720	8545720	I might get it, assuming that I ever do get a Wii. That's the only current council I don't have yet, but I may get a Wii just for President and Cat.
8545720	8549720	All right, I'm just going to put you down as a yes. All right, what's on your mind tonight?
8549720	8565720	Yeah, I don't know if you saw one of my earlier tweets today before your show went live, but I have asked the three of you if you have seen Detuned on PlayStation Network Store yet.
8565720	8570720	I have not seen this, but I know you were tweeting some things about it. What's this all about?
8570720	8585720	It simply puts like a cross between Linger and Shadows, which has been on the store forever, and music visualizer.
8585720	8607720	It's kind of both of two things together, and that's what Detuned is. It's not actually a game, it's part art and part music visualizer, and like any other game for the PS3, it also has trophies.
8607720	8626720	So if you're kind of like bored of your music visualizers on the PS3, and you need something else to look at, if you're a trophy whore, then I suggest getting it to Detuned.
8626720	8629720	Is there a demo that I can check out?
8629720	8640720	Not yet, but I would imagine that probably they may come up with one soon. When exactly, I don't know.
8640720	8645720	I'm trying to see if maybe there's like a YouTube or something I can kind of check out here.
8645720	8656720	I'm looking, I actually just loaded up somebody's video that looks like they shot their TV to show this game, and I'm trying to look at a little bit of the game in action here, so I can kind of see what it looks like.
8656720	8668720	But this looks like a very, oh this looks crazy. Dude, there's like elephant, maybe President Cat needs to go to PlayStation Network. Seriously, if this game's on it, I don't know.
8668720	8669720	What the heck?
8669720	8697720	Yeah, and also, the other thing I mentioned in the same tweet is that I know you kind of talked on it earlier on, and I know you're not exactly the type of gamer, but you know, I'm tired too with one of the more recent games I got, and I swear to God, it is pretty good.
8697720	8713720	And you know, if you like, you know, the Indiana Jones type of stuff, you know, I would suggest getting it.
8713720	8724720	You know, you're seeing that every major company out there that does reviews gave it basically purpose.
8724720	8734720	I know, I saw. The reviews are nothing but positive. I'm sure the game's great, it's just, you know, I don't usually play those type of games, but I probably will check it out right after I get President Cat, okay?
8734720	8735720	Sure.
8735720	8739720	All right. Take care, buddy. We're going to let you go so we can get some more calls. Have a good one.
8739720	8740720	I have to hear that.
8740720	8741720	Yes, you too.
8741720	8746720	Later. 1877 game, OLR. Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this?
8746720	8747720	It's Legend of Zaku.
8747720	8751720	Zaku, you know what I'm going to ask you first. President Cat, yay or nay?
8751720	8756720	If he offers as much change as Obama, then yay.
8756720	8759720	All right, I'm all for it. What's on your mind tonight?
8759720	8766720	Nothing much, just trying to reflect on this weekend. Obviously, I popped my Rocky Horror Picture Show cherry last night.
8766720	8768720	Did you really? What did you think?
8768720	8771720	First of all, how did you get de-virginized?
8771720	8775720	Let's say I had to fake an orgasm.
8775720	8776720	Nice.
8776720	8777720	That's pretty standard.
8777720	8782720	At least you didn't have to do the Twinkie or Banana Blowjob.
8782720	8785720	Did you have a good time?
8785720	8787720	It was pretty good, to be honest with you.
8787720	8798720	Aside from that, I'm just mulling over the bullshit decision that Infinity Ward made over the weekend regarding Modern Warfare 2 PC.
8798720	8800720	And what's that?
8800720	8811720	Killing off dedicated servers, basically making the whole game a living hell for clans and the ability to mob the hell out of it.
8811720	8815720	This seems to be a trend this year with PC games.
8815720	8820720	The only reason why I say that is because remember what a hissy fit everybody went into over Starcraft 2?
8820720	8822720	You can't play on LANs right now.
8822720	8829720	It seems like all these game companies want to centralize things on their own servers for various reasons.
8829720	8836720	It's not even that. It's just that they're introducing matchmaking as an integral part of Modern Warfare 2.
8836720	8842720	Basically bringing it down to the level of consoles.
8842720	8845720	Not that it hasn't been done already.
8845720	8855720	Left 4 Dead does it, but what I hear is not as severe or drastic as what Infinity Ward is trying to do.
8855720	8867720	And that worries me right now because if you have no means of setting up dedicated servers and you have to rely on other people's connections, it'll just be like Xbox Live.
8867720	8875720	And it basically kills off any aspect of gaming, playing against more than 16 people at the same time.
8875720	8888720	The fact of the matter is that dedicated servers pretty much has always been the norm for PC games for the most part.
8888720	8894720	Growing up playing on Quake 2 for example on dedicated servers.
8894720	8898720	I don't know, I guess they're going ass backwards.
8898720	8907720	I guess it's worse being regressive regarding this. And it's pissing off a lot of people. A lot of people canceling their pre-orders.
8907720	8915720	So either that or they're being kept in the dark regarding this.
8915720	8919720	My god, are you tearing your computer apart during the show?
8919720	8931720	No, no, no. I was going to get Modern Warfare 2, but after reading this I'm kind of questioning that notion of actually investing in that game.
8931720	8936720	It's tough for me, Zaku, because you know Modern Warfare isn't the type of game I would usually play.
8936720	8943720	But obviously I know it's going to be epic, especially for fans of that genre. I'm not going to knock it because it sets trends.
8943720	8951720	But I can see where people are getting a little irritated, but really you're going to go without the game completely when it's going to be this year's biggest game?
8951720	8959720	I understand that it's supposed to be Halo and all the other games.
8959720	8971720	But when you basically cut off the bread and butter of most clans and the fact that they won't allow me to play with the same regular people.
8971720	8975720	As I normally would if I find a good decent server for that game.
8975720	8981720	And I have to play with just some random Joe Shmuck, whoever the hell is at my level.
8981720	8988720	It kind of turns me off. I went through the same thing when playing Call of Duty 4 on 360.
8988720	9000720	It was just a lot of ass hattery and it just didn't feel right when I should be playing that game on my PC with a decent server where everyone at least knows who you are.
9000720	9005720	Alright. Zaku, any quick thoughts before we move on to some more calls?
9005720	9014720	Infinity Ward needs to either release more information or just really rethink about what they just said, about what they're planning to do.
9014720	9020720	Because they've already lost one sale out of probably thousands if not millions.
9020720	9022720	At least that's money you can invest in, President Cat.
9022720	9025720	Alright, take care Zaku. Have a good night.
9025720	9026720	Have a good one.
9026720	9032720	Speaking of President Cat, the updates keep coming. They're trying to explain to us what it is.
9032720	9037720	And basically they tweeted us to this Google image search that shows us what the Sukeban is.
9037720	9039720	That was Yo-Yo Cop Girl.
9039720	9045720	That's completely mistranslated. Sukeban, that's a word I knew.
9045720	9049720	Because like I said, it means a boss girl. And that's the typical look.
9049720	9052720	Rob, did you ever play Project Justice?
9052720	9053720	No.
9053720	9060720	Well there's a character in that called Zaki who wore the long skirt and everything with her uniform.
9060720	9063720	And it's like a girl gang leader.
9063720	9069720	So maybe they need to call the game Mistress Cat because these look like a mistress.
9069720	9075720	But I just like the name President Cat and I do want to point out in all these pictures, look at the colors the Sukeban are wearing.
9075720	9078720	Red, white, and blue. Am I right? Am I right?
9078720	9080720	That's just typical uniform colors though.
9080720	9084720	Coincidence or not, it's funny and adds to the cause. I still like the name President Cat.
9084720	9090720	At any rate, I think the best way to describe the title of the game is basically we've been going and I said,
9090720	9094720	oh she controls the house and they were going, no she controls the office.
9094720	9101720	So I think it's like she is sort of like the real leader of the office. You know what I mean?
9101720	9108720	Like Shermie is the real princess of the house. She inserts her own control over the house.
9108720	9111720	More calls at 1-877-GAME-OLR.
9111720	9115720	Loki, do you have any last minute stories? I see you looking at something about...
9115720	9118720	Oh, I was just doing search for the cat thing and there's someone talking about it.
9118720	9124720	They thought it was a Dreamcast game. It's the NTSC-UK forums.
9124720	9131720	We're talking about the cat game. They call it the Dreamcast Cat game because it has a little Dreamcast swirl on it.
9131720	9133720	Spirals on our cheeks for the blush.
9133720	9136720	Well did you respond and say it's fucking President Cat? Now salute.
9136720	9142720	No, I didn't say that. However, I did notice that there was someone that posted on the Game Facts forum,
9142720	9150720	the only post, I suspect, to act deaf, that said President Cat for 2012, you know what you want or something.
9150720	9156720	I love that idea. Go flood the Game Facts forums with President Cat love. Please.
9156720	9159720	That is the most awesome Suki Bhandeka picture ever.
9159720	9164720	And I understand that, you know, President Cat isn't necessarily what it translates into,
9164720	9172720	but, you know, bossy or authoritative, you know, female cat just doesn't have the same ring as President Cat.
9172720	9174720	And the president of a company, CEO Cat, I mean...
9174720	9178720	Yeah, exactly. I think President Cat has the best ring to it. We'll see what happens.
9178720	9180720	You could do Company President Cat.
9180720	9185720	All right. I don't think we're getting any other calls. Do we have any... Oh, sorry.
9185720	9187720	Grand Empress Cat.
9187720	9188720	All right.
9188720	9190720	Loki, do you have any last minute stories?
9190720	9199720	So, just like they did with the NHL, EA is bringing Madden NFL Arcade to Xbox Live Arcade and PlayStation Network.
9199720	9204720	It will be a five-on-five football game with kind of like a backyard scenario.
9204720	9209720	They say the first of 30, four plays per progression, no penalties, no field goals.
9209720	9215720	And that'll be coming for $15 in some time in December.
9215720	9221720	Also, Nice America wants to bring A Holy Invasion of Privacy Bad Man to UMD.
9221720	9227720	Ironically enough, this game was originally going to come out in UMD, but for whatever reason, it got cock-blocked into download only.
9227720	9234720	But they're looking for 1,000 fans to basically promise that they're going to pre-order the game.
9234720	9240720	And if you do that, by November 13th, they will bring out the game.
9240720	9241720	Interesting.
9241720	9248720	Yes. Apparently, third-party publishers are not required to release PSP games on the PlayStation Store.
9248720	9252720	All the more reason that you have the option of buying a UMD game.
9252720	9257720	And that's why you need to own a PlayStation 3, or PSP 3000 and not a Go.
9257720	9260720	But, you know, hey, you're just limiting your options.
9260720	9267720	Finally, Borderlands, a game that hasn't even come out yet, is already getting its first bit of download content.
9267720	9273720	It's almost kind of tying in with, you know, the, I guess, Halloween season.
9273720	9280720	But the Zombie Island of Dr. Ned, apparently, will be the first bit of download content for $10.
9280720	9286720	And it'll be on the PlayStation 3, Windows, and Xbox Live Marketplace.
9286720	9290720	And apparently, it's... I don't know what's coming out there.
9290720	9297720	I don't know if that's going to be released at launch, or if it's slightly afterwards.
9297720	9300720	Yeah, later this year, they say. So, interesting.
9300720	9303720	Alright, I got a couple stories that I missed on the Twitter of the Tigerclaw.
9303720	9305720	Really wanted me to mention for you guys, so I said sure.
9305720	9309720	Because I got, obviously, I've been extremely distracted on Twitter for tonight.
9309720	9313720	GameStop has mentioned what the Super Street Fighter IV price and ship date is.
9313720	9315720	But remember, this is in their system.
9315720	9318720	It doesn't mean it's necessarily 100% true, but it's nice to imagine.
9318720	9322720	That it is really going to cost $39.99 on the Xbox 360 or PS3.
9322720	9327720	And that the date it's coming, March 23rd, 2010, is the rumored date.
9327720	9332720	Also, in related news, I think this was something that was briefly covered on a previous show.
9332720	9339720	The Cleveland fan, John Thompson, also known as Big Dog, had recently sued EA.
9339720	9342720	Because EA used his likeness in Madden NFL.
9342720	9345720	He's one of the super fans that actually dresses up as a dog for the games.
9345720	9349720	Yeah, I can't really explain it either, but I'm assuming if you follow football or live in Cleveland,
9349720	9351720	you know what I'm talking about.
9351720	9354720	He has settled the suit, apparently, $25,000.
9354720	9357720	So, there you go.
9357720	9360720	I'm sorry, the suit has been settled not necessarily for $25,000.
9360720	9365720	That is what he was seeking originally, but we don't know exactly how much it was settled for.
9365720	9367720	So, there you go.
9367720	9369720	And that's going to do it for Last Minute Stories tonight.
9369720	9372720	No other calls on Skypline tonight, so I guess that's it.
9372720	9374720	We just have shy callers tonight.
9374720	9378720	So, that's going to do it, I guess, for tonight's episode of Orange Launch Radio.
9378720	9380720	Thank you guys so much for tuning in to us and supporting our show.
9380720	9383720	I know it was a crazy-ass show tonight, but you know what?
9383720	9385720	It was fun. It was a lot of fun.
9385720	9392720	But I'm just waiting for the backlash to begin on President Cat, but you're a fool if you don't support it.
9392720	9395720	Let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts.
9395720	9396720	Oh, hey, hey, guess what?
9396720	9397720	Oh, God, more?
9397720	9398720	Yeah.
9398720	9406720	Renna Wee says, yeah, I like to and I think President Cat is better.
9406720	9408720	So, they like President Cat.
9408720	9416720	So, now I've got a goal to make President Cat a trending topic on Twitter.
9416720	9417720	Good luck with that.
9417720	9422720	It takes a lot to get a trending topic, but I think the more we can show that, again,
9422720	9426720	I'm totally serious about let's use our picture stream for something really useful.
9426720	9432720	Send in President Cat fan art, something that we can send to them so they can show people.
9432720	9433720	That's how this is going to happen.
9433720	9440720	They have to be able to prove to some American publisher that America actually wants this game and that it's not a fucking joke.
9440720	9441720	You know what?
9441720	9442720	What?
9442720	9444720	I think we need to start a Shermie blog.
9444720	9446720	I'm serious.
9446720	9447720	Shermie needs a Twitter?
9447720	9448720	Shermie needs a Twitter.
9448720	9458720	Shermie is going to be like – well, no, they have their little blog for their – for Renna, yeah, who is like the boss cat and all the other.
9458720	9461720	Seriously, I was just reading this one about this other cat going, oh, you know.
9461720	9464720	So, it will be Shermie's goal to get President Cat out in the U.S.?
9464720	9465720	Yeah.
9465720	9474720	And she can be – or Shermie can be Secretary of Fat because Shermie is a fat cat.
9474720	9475720	She is.
9475720	9476720	I love my big fat baby.
9476720	9477720	But she's awesome.
9477720	9478720	My big fat hairy stinky baby.
9478720	9480720	And Rama reminds us about the OLR ferret.
9480720	9482720	We don't know who started OLR ferret.
9482720	9484720	I think it's Jason, but I don't know for sure.
9484720	9486720	Like I don't know who OLR ferret is.
9486720	9487720	So, it could be Dekeman.
9487720	9488720	I don't know.
9488720	9491720	It's probably one of our web geeks behind the scenes.
9491720	9492720	But we don't know who started that.
9492720	9495720	But hopefully, OLR ferret will get in on the cause too.
9495720	9498720	Anyhow, you haven't heard the last of President Cat.
9498720	9503720	We finally found a cause here on Orange Lounge Radio, one of several causes I'm sure.
9503720	9506720	Oh, we got one more call coming through on the Skype line.
9506720	9508720	Let's take a call.
9508720	9509720	Hi.
9509720	9510720	You're on Orange Lounge Radio.
9510720	9511720	Who's this?
9511720	9524720	Thank you so much for downloading and supporting Orange Lounge Radio.
9524720	9525720	Oh, we didn't get everybody's final thought.
9525720	9526720	I'm sorry.
9526720	9528720	Loki, your final thought.
9528720	9533720	My final thought is Daytona.
9533720	9537720	DarkSakura, did you have anything else you wanted to add?
9537720	9538720	Meow.
9538720	9541720	My final thought is President Cat for 2012.
9541720	9542720	Actually, 2010.
9542720	9544720	We need President Cat a lot sooner.
9544720	9545720	Governor Cat in 2010.
9545720	9547720	Governor Cat.
9547720	9552720	We need President Cat to take over the mafia.
9552720	9553720	All right.
9553720	9554720	That's going to do it.
9554720	9556720	Thank you guys so much for downloading and supporting Internet Radio.
9556720	9557720	President Cat.
9557720	9559720	And President Cat indirectly.
9559720	9562720	Look, guys, honestly, I said it before in a minute.
9562720	9565720	There's millions of shows talking about Uncharted 2 this week,
9565720	9567720	and we're certainly not hating on the game by any means.
9567720	9568720	We're just like you.
9568720	9570720	We don't get paid.
9570720	9571720	Did somebody put that on our Twitter?
9571720	9575720	Ikuma JP put a picture of a kitten dressed up as a Sukeban,
9575720	9579720	so I'm going to post that on our Twitter.
9579720	9580720	I fucking love it.
9580720	9581720	Not the Twitter, but on...
9581720	9583720	Place that in chat for chatters.
9583720	9584720	Can C, please?
9584720	9585720	Thank you.
9585720	9586720	God damn, the show's amazing tonight.
9586720	9587720	All right.
9587720	9588720	Thank you, guys.
9588720	9590720	Honestly, I meant it when I said it earlier, you know,
9590720	9592720	and we're certainly not hating on Uncharted 2 by any means.
9592720	9593720	We're just like you.
9593720	9595720	We have to pay $60 of our own money if we want to play the game.
9595720	9597720	They don't send us this stuff for free,
9597720	9598720	so we'll get to those stuff eventually.
9598720	9600720	But seriously, what other show are you going to hear about,
9600720	9602720	President Cat, on this week?
9602720	9604720	Let's make it happen, guys.
9604720	9606720	It's the OL Army, and the way you can help us out,
9606720	9609720	always just tell two friends about our show and help spread the word.
9609720	9611720	From us to you guys, thank you so much.
9611720	9612720	We'll see you next week.
9612720	9613720	We'll be back to do this all again,
9613720	9617720	and I'm sure plenty of updates on this whole President Cat thing
9617720	9622720	and even more of gaming news because it's just a lullsy time
9622720	9623720	here at Orange Lounge Radio.
9623720	9628720	So on behalf of myself, DarkSakura, Loki, doo-doo-doo-doo guy,
9628720	9630720	and President Cat, we'll see you next time.
