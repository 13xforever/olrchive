14031	15873	Night, October 18, 2009.
16414	24343	Playing early bootlegs Gichuban from Xbox, the PSP series gains heavy product placement tie-ins, and the classic arcade racer returns.
31445	31905	DarkSakura.com
49602	52584	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
77338	77658	Yes, I was.
77698	79620	So we got to hear, and you have the full version now.
79660	80060	Yes, I do.
80240	81681	So we got to hear some of the mixes.
82061	84443	So I'm kind of curious what our chat thought of what they got to hear.
84523	87205	Sadly, you know, we can't reproduce it for the podcast because of copyright and all that.
87565	90647	But we were playing the, what was that?
91167	93089	Eric Pryde's Tears for Fears.
93769	97011	Eric Pryde's piano versus Tears for Fears shout.
97191	103355	And then, of course, MC Hammer with Can't Touch This and Vanilla Ice.
103415	107038	Which was sounding really epic in the beginning, but got a little.
107878	109839	It's not one of the better tracks in there.
109879	111219	But there's a lot of good tracks in there.
111419	112620	And we'll get into that later.
112660	115541	But I'm not disappointed at all.
115741	117041	Well, we'll get into that in just a minute.
117081	119082	I know Loki wants to talk about that during his gaming week.
119122	123124	But first, I need to plug our lovely bandwidth hosts.
123284	125985	The one and only www.allgames.com.
126025	130046	All Games Radio always helps us out by letting us steal their bandwidth every Sunday night.
130066	132187	And they are the home to a bunch of great programs.
132247	135628	Not just Bobby, who's usually on before us when he's not in a drum line.
136088	136969	All games radio www.allgames.com
154158	155199	Well, why not?
155779	156099	Sad.
156620	157841	You should come join us some Sunday.
157881	164666	And if you are hearing this on a Sunday night that happens to be October 18th, then we actually are live and you are tuned in to All Games Radio.
164946	169289	And you know that we're going to start off the show, as we always do, with a little bit of How Is Your Gaming Week.
169350	171451	DarkSakura, what types of video games have you been playing this week?
173533	176255	You do have to speak at some point during this radio show.
176695	177055	Okay.
177376	177756	I'm fine.
177996	178717	I play Peggle.
179817	180438	And how is Peggle?
181087	182028	What type of comics?
206811	210333	I will pull... Oh, look, my game decides to start working now.
211313	212674	I'm going to build a house live on air.
213254	218056	Deadpool 900, including the epic story of Deadpool versus mimes.
218496	220477	We have Deadpool versus mimes?
220777	221537	Yes, look at the cover.
221777	222097	Mimes.
223278	225058	That's not a very fair fight if you ask me.
225099	230121	They're mimes that are powered with psychological weapons that their mimery actually causes real damage.
230141	230861	Their mimery?
231241	231841	Their mimery.
232561	233022	Mimicry.
233522	234022	No mimery.
234142	234862	I like the word mimery.
235123	236163	Knock that miming off.
237426	238581	I've had to play with... You know...
239349	241130	I've got to play with your audio a little bit, by the way.
241190	244773	If you are hearing DarkSakura kind of fade in and out, it's live radio.
244793	245733	That kind of thing happens.
246234	247675	We adjust audio on the fly sometimes.
247815	248615	Because remember, though.
249096	249276	What?
249876	251377	A mime is a wonderful thing to waste.
251577	251877	Shut up.
252458	252858	Hey, wait.
252898	254799	I have an idea for a new segment, though, DarkSakura.
254959	255280	What?
255760	259603	We're going to do a segment called DarkSakura Reviews Games Through Grunting.
260223	260623	You ready?
260943	261944	What game should I review?
262244	265887	I'm going to name some games and you review them with a grunt.
266367	266607	Okay.
266667	267628	We'll start with something easy.
268048	268308	Sims 3.
270350	287222	Marvel Ultimate Alliance Yaris DJ Hero Speaking of which, I don't know if there's anything else Loki, do you have anything you want DarkSakura to review with a grunt?
287803	295048	No I can't think of anything else The Shadow Complex Okay, Shadow Complex Bayonetta
296448	297969	Alright.
298849	300389	Hey cheater, that's not even out yet.
300829	303770	It's pretty though.
303830	305170	She's wearing her hair.
306651	307891	Loki, how was your gaming week?
309051	310252	It was good.
310292	311752	Played lots of Grand Theft Auto.
312372	314012	Lost and Damned.
314753	320974	There's been rumors going out there and I've seen it now that people have found a way around the patch so they can re-enable mods again.
321274	322555	I've been trying to figure out how to do that.
323215	323835	And I'm close.
324943	331426	But what I thought I needed to change actually freezes the game up, so not quite there yet, but I'm on the path to getting it done.
332586	335188	And I've obviously been playing lots of DJ Hero.
336748	344832	I played it for a few hours today and yesterday, and most of the game starts off locked when you, you know, most of the tracks that you can play.
345232	347573	So I've actually unlocked almost everything in the game so far.
347773	349034	I mean, that's how much I've been playing it.
349194	349294	And
349926	350366	Thanks for watching!
365652	365892	DarkSakura
393956	394256	DJ Hero, DJ Hero
418775	419876	Dig Dug, Mr. Doom, Pac-Man, CGA, etc.
440714	444656	But you don't download games on PlayStation Network to play them in four colors now, do you?
445097	449299	Obviously the game's been fleshed out with a whole new high def mode and pretty crisp graphics.
450740	455543	So if you're into retro gaming, I think you'll kind of like this, especially because it combines the elements of all these old games.
456663	459525	I like a lot of the retro games, though.
459585	462307	It can get a little repetitive, so be warned.
462387	465789	But they do try to throw in some things to make it interesting, like co-op survival and
466109	467610	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
485367	486348	Thank you for watching!
500818	501879	But not bad.
502219	504301	I'm not depressed with the money I spent.
504621	508183	But I don't think it's a wow, OMG, run out and buy it right now type game either.
508483	513587	I think if you like the old retro classics, you like your 80s PC games, you'll get a kick out of this.
514627	523854	But maybe you'll find out faster than I did that there's actually a fire button and you can actually shoot the oncoming enemies that makes the game a little easier when you feel a little overwhelmed.
524054	524934	Because I had no idea.
524974	527636	There's no tutorial or nothing to kind of get you going with the game.
527996	530138	So that's my one little piece of feedback for it.
530818	537643	Otherwise, OMG, World of Warcraft, LOL, WTFBBQ I'm just looking for donations, by the way Are you?
538263	559478	Yeah Everybody's looking for donations on this show Well, no, I mean, because I can't I know, I know But I am up to level 52 on my paladin I just hit 52 before the show tonight Which isn't bad, considering I think she rolled on September 3rd or 4th So I haven't been playing that long So I'm happy And I don't have triple XP or anything like that So I'm happy So
560459	587246	that's it for my gaming week pretty much otherwise the same type of stuff I already talked about last week like Demon's Souls and Katamari Forever and all that fun stuff so now that we've talked about our gaming weeks let's get into some housekeeping real quick but actually not a lot for that segment either so I'm just gonna plug our Twitter at www.twitter.com slash OLR and of course we also have our Facebook community just search for OL Army by the way we're gonna create an actual page on there too I can't remember if I mentioned this last week or not
588066	610854	I was going to work on that more this week but I got sidetracked leveling a paladin so I'm hopefully going to get that done actually we had a lot of shows that we were behind on the feed too three shows went up this week on the podcast feed so you can't say it and do anything for a while I got that just about caught up and yeah so look for that on Facebook and we have a MySpace if anyone actually uses that anymore does anyone use MySpace anymore?
611214	611614	I don't think so
612360	617542	The last thing I did on MySpace was look at my art history teacher's blog.
617722	620003	The last thing I did on MySpace was block spammers.
620404	623585	Nellie looked at MySpace the other day and she's like, wow, it looks like Facebook now.
624365	627927	They did change some stuff on there to try and make it more Facebook-y, I guess.
628127	631448	Facebook did something that makes me happy.
631568	631888	What's that?
632008	634730	I can now block everything I don't freaking want to see.
635230	637811	I can keep from getting this stupid sorority life invites.
638735	639835	They've had that for months.
663530	665451	Anyhow, let's move on.
665511	669072	Let's talk less ranting on social networking and more gaming news.
669632	670452	We'll start off tonight.
670752	672793	The wonderful Loki is going to start us off tonight.
673353	685277	Yes, Nintendo has partnered up with Capcom and 53 other video game publishers in Japan to file suit against four resellers of the popular R4 flash cartridge, you know, the one that launches the pirate stuff.
685977	688038	Apparently, though...
689767	691829	In Tokyo court, it banned the sale of the devices.
691870	696775	However, these four retailers are kind of ignoring that.
697035	701440	So there's a new lawsuit now that finally stopped these guys from selling it.
704504	706326	I mean, it's kind of interesting if you think about it, because...
708690	710531	They've been making threats about this stuff for a while now.
710651	719937	And I kind of find it funny that they're really only targeting the R4 because that is the most widely known backup device, but there's tons of them out there.
720037	725761	I mean, the R4s, I don't even think it's being used as much nowadays as some of these other ones.
727222	727542	I don't know.
728042	733426	But I guess it's a start because I know piracy really eats into the DS sales.
734764	735885	Especially overseas, right?
735905	738087	They have more of a problem with this overseas than they do here, right?
738287	738628	Definitely.
740629	742211	Are you surprised by this move?
742291	745874	I mean, I can't think of anything quite like this that I've heard of recently.
746094	746935	Well, it makes sense.
746975	750559	I mean, the court already banned the sales of this stuff.
750859	755303	They went ahead and ignored the loss, so of course they're going to have a lawsuit put against them.
756904	757205	I don't know.
757245	758706	It's not surprising, I guess.
759387	759587	Yeah.
760353	761554	Okay.
761954	767317	Why... Do you think there's a legitimate purpose for someone having an R4, or is this just straight-up piracy?
767697	776483	I mean, is there any type of way that they could come into court and say, oh, well, this R4 has a legitimate purpose, or I mean, is it just 100% piracy?
777363	787570	It does have a legitimate purpose as far as enabling homebrew, but once again, though, it's kind of reversing... reverse engineering, you know, the DS sort of to make it work, that kind of stuff.
787590	788050	So...
790467	795688	Yeah, it might allow for homebrew stuff, but any of the homebrew enabling...
797028	798069	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
823183	823803	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
844026	849450	Maybe later on some of the games will patch it so that you can't play those ROMs or whatever on your R4 device.
849570	854314	But the ones that are already made out there, there's nothing they can do about it because they can't patch it.
854534	856075	I got a wild question for you.
856956	858497	Isn't homebrew piracy in a way?
859218	862080	I mean, any homebrew that's cooked up.
862120	869425	Because aren't you supposed to buy a very expensive kit from Nintendo or Sony or whoever it is to develop for the system?
869445	869805	No.
870546	872508	We're supposed to buy these very expensive kits to help you do that?
878337	884901	And, you know, because of all the stipulations that they have, the testing process has to go through and, you know, development kits and whatnot.
885641	889903	Then, yeah, to be in market, you'd have to be like an authorized developer.
890444	891664	But this isn't really in market.
891704	894066	This is just kind of crap that they're throwing on there.
894426	896887	But it encourages people to hack their stuff, right?
897227	900789	People are going to hack it no matter what, whether the carts are out there or something else.
900849	902790	I mean, they'll find a way around it.
903571	903731	Hmm.
904389	910671	All right, well, I'm going to our chat room at chat.orangelawnsradio.com, and it looks like there's just other devices out there.
911191	913172	Azure Edge says, I have Ace Card 2.
913632	915973	I've never heard of this, but I guess that's another similar device?
916353	917974	Yeah, there's the Ace Card.
918014	921115	There's CycloDS Evolution.
921215	927477	They've also got the M3, I think like the D6 or something like that.
929418	930919	So why are we just hearing about R4 then?
931380	934362	Because it's the popular one, I guess.
935142	937424	It's just like, you know, like Napster.
937604	941728	Remember there was Napster and a lot of other file sharing services, but everyone went after Napster.
941768	944330	Oh yeah, LimeWire, Virus Heaven, I remember that one.
945130	950034	Well, I'm just saying that there were other services out there, but, you know, they're going to go after them.
950094	950935	Just like Pirate Bay.
951175	957279	They're going after Pirate Bay because that's the most, I guess, they're making an example out of them or something like that.
957600	957960	Yeah, but...
959156	961137	They really can't do anything about Pirate Bay.
961997	964278	Unless they get international law changed.
965019	967040	Didn't Pirate Bay have to stop?
967120	968100	Didn't something happen with that?
968140	968641	I mean, I don't know.
968701	969681	I don't use Pirate Bay.
969701	970922	It did, but it's still up.
971682	973103	So I don't really know.
973543	975544	I guess it didn't work very well.
975664	983347	Going to our chat again, Tiger Claw says, Homebrew is also used to create applications that can be useful for non-gaming purposes, like listening to internet radio and such.
984008	985388	Hey, I guess that would be useful, wouldn't it?
985769	986529	For programs like this.
988341	1010167	well it's also the kind of you know put the applications and features that you want on a certain console it's a way to build those in where you know said company is not putting them in and actually some companies like Sony have learned from the homebrew community and see you know have seen what they put in there and they've added that support in later on
1012085	1016371	Sometimes little things kind of get endorsed too.
1016451	1021898	I seem to remember, you know, speaking of, because Tiger Claw's comment kind of made me think of internet radio on the Wii.
1022058	1029729	There was a program a while back, and I can't remember the name of it, and I don't even know if it's still developed, but it was a program that was supposed to let you get podcasts on your Wii.
1030169	1034130	Like it downloaded them to some program and then you... Sorry, not the Wii, the Xbox 360.
1034490	1035571	You can get podcasts on the 360.
1036271	1042533	And I remember it was really controversial because all the podcasts that were in it by default, it was downloading like the last five episodes all at once.
1042573	1043993	Maybe somebody in chat can remember the name of this.
1044674	1044794	And...
1046094	1049417	I remember we were listed in a future version of it after that bug was taken out.
1050017	1055122	The reason why I bring it up is that I seem to remember Major Nelson mentioned it on his blog or something.
1055142	1061006	That's why the thing got so popular so fast and it just screwed the bandwidth of all these sites.
1061026	1063508	I remember Gamer Andy was pissed about it.
1063969	1068012	TigerClaw says it's TVercity, but that's actually not the one I'm thinking of.
1068072	1072536	I think that lets you do podcasts also, but that's not the same one I'm thinking of.
1072616	1073897	That's what you use for streaming video.
1075038	1075238	Yeah.
1076414	1076774	POKEMON POKEMON
1103502	1107183	Nintendo officially unveiled the game this week, meaning screenshots and all that fun stuff.
1107524	1109524	It is coming out in Japan on December 5th.
1109564	1111245	It'll set you back 4,800 yen.
1111565	1114626	That would be $53 in exchange rates.
1116147	1124150	Sadly, though, it's not really a Pokemon Game Boy game on the Wii like people have been wanting, oh, I don't know, forever.
1125170	1146466	instead, it's a game where you are of course Pikachu because what other Pokemon is nearly as famous and you're in like a theme park and you tag, battle, and participate in quiz minigames oh joy, it's another minigame collection on the Nintendo Wii only this time, it has Pokemon but my Pokemans, let me show you them
1147428	1150049	Also, Pikachu interacts with new friends.
1150370	1154171	There's also a camera mode to let you photograph the Pokemon you meet.
1154552	1157433	I guess kind of tipping the hat to Pokemon Snap, which was kind of awesome.
1158273	1159574	But no words about Mudkips.
1159894	1160414	Sorry, guys.
1161615	1163336	But Pokemans, Rob.
1163656	1167778	I know it's Pokemans, but it's not like the Game Boy Pokemon games.
1168038	1169159	Don't care, Pokemans.
1169199	1169759	It'll sell.
1170079	1171420	Nintendo prints money.
1172099	1176021	I guess so, but I'm just like, yay, another minigame collection on the Wii.
1176341	1179942	Although, to be fair, they're talking about tagging and battling and all this other stuff, too.
1180483	1186285	And I shouldn't judge a game before I play it, but you're not giving me a lot to go off of here.
1186325	1192968	It's not like the Wii has demos, either, and I'm not going to spend $40 or $50 on a game just to find out it's another crappy minigame collection.
1193488	1195809	But, but, but, Rob, Pokemons...
1196513	1199054	DarkTattooia in chat says Pokemon Snap needs a sequel.
1199594	1204936	It sort of does, and maybe that's what they're trying to allude to with this, but I wouldn't say that this is a sequel by any means.
1205277	1212900	Now I'm looking at screenshots, and here's one where it looks like Pikachu's kind of fighting Charizard with some timer on the screen doing battles, so I don't know, maybe...
1213740	1222383	Maybe there's something cool in there, but it's not the role-playing Pokemon a lot of you guys have come to know and love, which I think is the game people really want on the Wii.
1224063	1226784	That's sad and a shame and a travesty.
1227284	1227484	It is.
1227684	1230165	You know what else is sad and a shame and a travesty?
1230345	1230545	What?
1231165	1232265	What Sega's doing.
1232406	1233026	What is Sega doing?
1233046	1237367	Bringing back a piece of my tortured past into full HD life.
1239007	1239848	I do not understand.
1239908	1240588	Please elaborate.
1241905	1245488	I don't know if I've ever told you about my nightmares of Daytona USA.
1246429	1248770	Even if you have, it's probably been years, so tell them again.
1249891	1256516	When I worked for my Namco Arcade, we had a four-person Daytona USA, and it would follow me.
1256716	1259698	I would hear, Daytona!
1260659	1263641	Or, Rolling Star!
1264721	1266263	What about Daytona?
1266303	1268404	That too.
1268884	1269865	But it's coming back.
1270085	1270926	It is coming back.
1272034	1275336	Oh, is it ever, as Sega Racing Classic.
1275757	1277137	Sega Racing!
1279259	1283802	And it's going to be on the Ringwide arcade hardware.
1284502	1292007	And it's being called Sega Racing Classic because they don't have the rights to the Daytona name anymore.
1293408	1294589	Oh, well that makes sense, I guess.
1294609	1297211	So I guess we're not going to get the Daytona...
1298678	1301020	So, but you know what I want?
1301161	1307146	Is I want cameos by Pepsi Man and by Sega Tassanchiro.
1309208	1310029	That would make me happy.
1310590	1314193	Sega always has the most interesting product placement in their games.
1314213	1316015	Because I think about Crazy Taxi.
1316075	1317656	I also want to race as the horse in the game.
1318297	1323142	And I want a little mini game in there where you can make the cars fight each other like Fighters Megamix.
1325098	1327939	X-Link in chat says, I work at an arcade and I hated that song.
1328259	1328939	Yeah, see?
1329139	1335342	Anyone who has worked in an arcade where the attract mode is turned sufficiently loud enough knows my pain.
1336802	1337702	Knows my pain.
1338363	1339023	I'd have nightmares.
1339263	1339903	I'm not kidding.
1340003	1340663	I would have nightmares.
1341163	1341524	Nightmares.
1341944	1342164	Nice.
1343224	1343924	No, it's not.
1344445	1344985	It's awful.
1346277	1357503	How would you like to be in the middle of dreaming about, you know, so-and-so gorgeous person and then hear, oh god, knock it off.
1357563	1360685	Maybe I don't understand because I've never played this Daytona game.
1360865	1362126	I just somehow missed it, I guess.
1362466	1373952	I played Daytona USA at the Luxor the first time I went to Las Vegas when the game first came out and had the eight-person big rally set up.
1375618	1376599	I thought it was cool then.
1376639	1378320	That's the last time I ever thought that game was cool.
1378680	1380501	Wait, don't they have this at Dave & Buster's?
1381521	1382582	They have something similar.
1382602	1383563	I think they have NASCAR.
1385404	1388826	Maybe I played it years ago when they had it at Dave & Buster's, I think.
1389726	1392568	I mean, it was one of those games that they would have linked like 80,000 units.
1392628	1397431	Rob, you just need to go on YouTube and look up Daytona Rolling Start.
1397851	1399052	Sure, I'd be happy to.
1399752	1400833	It's fantastic radio.
1401333	1402854	And this is how everyone would know.
1402874	1404795	There you go, Tiger Claw linked the theme in the chat room.
1405478	1405779	Yeah.
1410266	1412890	Dude, Tigerclaw's like faster at researching stuff than I am.
1413911	1414773	Might have already been on it.
1415814	1417537	And I'm saying that because there's like a 45 second delay.
1426417	1428038	I have played this game.
1428098	1428939	Yes, you have.
1429079	1430060	Yes, I have.
1431181	1435384	Now that I'm not hearing your horrible karaoke rendition of it, I recognize it.
1435624	1439707	You need to find the Rolling Start one, because that's the one that I still hear in my sleep.
1441288	1442809	How could you not like this song?
1443209	1445091	It's totally not repetitive.
1445111	1446812	Because I have something called taste.
1448053	1451295	This almost sounds like it could be like an 80s cartoon theme, you know?
1451335	1451916	That'd be awesome.
1454978	1455238	DarkSakura
1484522	1485062	Knock knock.
1486223	1486583	What?
1493588	1497390	What?
1497430	1497791	Shut up.
1499252	1500092	I will play it again.
1500392	1501393	I will fucking play it again.
1501413	1502434	I will kick you in the face.
1504975	1506496	You know, your ringtone is on my phone, by the way.
1506696	1506916	What?
1509578	1510098	I want to guess.
1510559	1510799	Is it?
1514486	1515186	No, no, no.
1515226	1520569	Let me borrow that toss.
1520589	1521930	Just let me borrow that toss.
1522290	1523571	So I gave you something more annoying.
1523671	1523951	All right.
1524631	1526152	I don't know what it is with this show tonight.
1526192	1529133	I'm just, I'm... It's called Jamie Has a Headache.
1529153	1529714	I feel sorry.
1530034	1532655	Oh, and Tiger Claw linked the Rolling Start, by the way.
1532895	1533315	Awesome.
1534836	1536917	That one, actually, I do like that one, okay?
1537417	1538698	Just because I think it's kind of neat.
1538778	1540399	I realize this game is like years and years old.
1540419	1540759	Rolling Start!
1545325	1548391	I love this soundtrack, what are you talking about?
1548491	1551076	It's more of a song you need to play the game to.
1563328	1566930	XLink in chat says, I'll fly over there and both of them in the face.
1567050	1569571	Except he left out, like, there's a word missing there, I think.
1570231	1573373	So, you know what you can do in the face?
1576634	1578035	Rob, you need to cleanse the palate.
1579755	1580596	All right, let's move on.
1580616	1581436	Loki, save us.
1582137	1582377	Yes.
1583117	1584558	Let's get into some release dates.
1584618	1587459	Perhaps that will end the Daytona chat.
1587930	1589832	Never, it will never end that chat.
1590232	1593714	Now, um, so coming out this week is actually a pretty good lineup of stuff.
1594255	1601240	Starting off, we've got Borderlands, which is making its way out to PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.
1604763	1605683	Did Rob mess up?
1607004	1607785	No, just go ahead.
1608145	1611047	I totally, like, skipped, like, three stories in the show, but that's okay.
1611067	1612548	Just do release dates now, we'll go back to it.
1612989	1613309	Alright.
1613689	1614350	Anyways, um...
1615819	1619442	I got too distracted by Daytona.
1619523	1620023	I'm sorry.
1621905	1623266	But it's good music to think to.
1625225	1633290	Alright, so yeah, as I said, Borderlands coming out this week, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, pretty awesome looking, so definitely check that out.
1634111	1645078	If you're into the football, or soccer as we call it in the US, FIFA Soccer 2010 will be coming out on DS, PSP, Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, PlayStation 2, and Wii.
1649727	1653990	Smackdown vs. Brawl 2010, also coming out this week on pretty much everything.
1655051	1658514	Space Invaders Extreme 2 making its way out on DS, finally.
1661980	1666383	It looks like the Wii version of NBA 2K10 was delayed to this week, so that'll be coming out as well.
1666783	1669905	Jillian Michaels Fitness Ultimatum 2010 on DS.
1670225	1670645	Yippee.
1671086	1671446	I know.
1672026	1672587	I'm excited.
1673627	1680191	Madagascar Karts on the Wii, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360, DS, and PSP.
1680712	1689237	And then with the Wii, of course, they also have a version with wheel, because goddammit, no one can pretend that the Wii remote is a steering wheel without a plastic piece of crap that's got attached to it.
1690365	1694368	Marvel Super Hero Squad coming out on PlayStation 2, Wii, and DS.
1696570	1699392	If you like your Marvel Ultimate Alliance super chibi.
1701194	1703155	Tropico 3 coming out on PC.
1704416	1708519	Charm Girls Club, Perfect Prom coming out on DS.
1709000	1712022	And yes, EA has a lot more to go with that as well.
1713982	1720546	Charm Girls Club Pajama Party on the Wii, Fashion Mall on DS, Fashion Show
1731932	1737613	And to go along with that, if you're not in the Charmed Girls Club, maybe Littlest Pet Shop, because they're whoring that out this week as well.
1738033	1740653	Littlest Pet Shop City Friends on DS this week.
1741314	1743654	Littlest Pet Shop Friends on the Wii.
1744834	1748015	Littlest Pet Shop Country Friends on DS.
1749195	1751395	And I'm sure there's one other one, but I don't really care.
1751415	1752515	What a bunch of crap.
1753276	1754376	Yes, exactly.
1754396	1755476	A bunch of horse crap.
1755756	1757236	Ha, because of the farm ones.
1758376	1760297	Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do.
1760457	1761317	Daytona.
1761977	1762797	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1791010	1792150	Thanks for watching!
1811698	1811878	They are!
1826721	1827781	Well, is your mic on?
1827861	1830903	I didn't... No, I turned it off because you said I was typing too loud.
1830963	1831323	That's right.
1831683	1835084	Well, so you had these grapes that were the size of eyeballs.
1835124	1838826	And it made me think how like... You remember like when you'd go to those haunted houses like when you were younger?
1839186	1843308	They'd put like frozen grapes like in a bowl and tell you it was a bowl full of eyeballs?
1843548	1843848	Yeah.
1843888	1844028	Yeah.
1844448	1845569	Cooking Mama Zombie Edition Mama Will Brains
1872117	1873459	Cookie Mama as the cleaner.
1874240	1875321	Don't worry, Mama will fix it.
1876983	1881129	DarkTetsuya in chat says, Cooking Mama, Rolling Stones.
1883959	1886221	Oh, that's going to be the joke all night.
1886402	1887603	Other games coming out this week.
1887743	1893289	Astro Boy, tying in with the new animated movie, coming out on Wii, PlayStation 2, DS, and PSP.

1916719	1919860	Imagine Fashion Designer World Tour on DS.
1923502	1923582	Uh...
1924827	1926028	Crap, crap, and more crap.
1926068	1927008	Is there anything interesting?
1927208	1931551	Bakugan on PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Wii, and DS.
1932992	1934973	And I'm sure there's something I'm missing here.
1936254	1937374	Good stuff, good stuff.
1937434	1938395	Alien Monster Bowling League?
1938475	1939676	No, no, that's not good.
1939696	1940616	Your Mom the Game.
1940676	1942317	It's on the Wii.
1942998	1945719	No, Your Mom the Game, I'm sorry, is not coming out this week.
1946540	1947180	It's too bad.
1947420	1948120	She got delayed.
1948601	1949521	She got delayed, yes.
1953103	1955446	Diner Dash, Flow on the Go for DS
1973274	1974995	No, that's wrong.
1975935	1976415	So wrong.
1976835	1977936	The joke's right itself.
1977996	1978896	I don't have to say anything.
1979176	1981837	Medieval Games on the Wii for all your Ren Faire fans.
1982137	1985779	Grand Theft Auto Chinatown Wars coming to the PSP this week, which looks pretty cool.
1987039	1989220	Dragon Ball Revenge of King Piccolo on the Wii.
1990862	1993484	Star Wars The Force Unleashed Ultimate Sith Edition on PC World of the Zoo
2013479	2023787	Finally, um, let's see, I wanted to actually read something from chat here that was, um, from Sycoon saying, Orange Lounge is one big tangent today.
2024187	2033835	Yes, it is, and I'm gonna start another one here, because speaking of release dates, going to last week's releases, we had a huge game come out this week that nobody mentioned during their gaming weeks, Uncharted 2.
2035076	2041621	I, anywhere I look, I can't stop hearing about this game and how fucking amazing it's supposed to be, like, you
2043522	2052069	I don't usually play a lot of the platformy Tomb Raider type of games, which I hear Uncharted 2 kind of is, so I haven't really been paying attention.
2052489	2061656	But now, as I will hear about how awesome this game is non-stop and how people are already calling it Game of the Year, I kind of feel like I need to play it.
2062036	2066359	So I've got to turn to Loki, who's talked about this game a little more on the show than I have.
2067300	2068241	What have you heard about this game?
2068261	2072083	You didn't mention it either, but I seriously have not heard a single thing bad about it.
2072324	2072804	Like, not one.
2074898	2076540	I don't know.
2076780	2077901	It got good reviews.
2078942	2079563	I'm not buying it.
2080144	2080464	Why not?
2080484	2082066	Because I don't want to buy it.
2083507	2086830	Is it one of those things where it's like, oh, well, you're too cool for school.
2086910	2087551	No, no, no.
2087611	2088312	It's not even that.
2088432	2089673	It's an action game.
2090174	2091695	Not even so much like Tomb Raider.
2091715	2095940	I mean, that was kind of the comparisons of the first game were kind of like, oh, it's Tomb Raider with a guy.
2097233	2097813	Not so much now.
2097833	2098953	I mean, it's more of just an action game.
2098973	2100474	It's a very cinematic action game.
2101234	2102314	I just don't have time for it.
2102855	2104435	And yeah, I can see why they're calling it Game of the Year.
2104815	2107516	It's practically the only game coming from Sony this fall.
2107876	2109937	So it is the Game of the Year.
2110037	2115118	I mean, they did have games in the spring, but you know, for argument's sake, we're going to ignore those.
2115758	2118379	But I don't know.
2118499	2118799	It's good.
2119232	2119972	I mean, don't get me wrong.
2120113	2120533	Game of the year?
2120633	2121974	Probably not.
2122034	2123495	Kind of some polarizing stuff in chat.
2123515	2126156	Sycoon says, if I got a free copy, I would totally play it.
2126476	2127077	That's a good point.
2127157	2128097	Games are 60 bucks.
2128458	2130699	But again, I haven't heard a negative thing about this game.
2130719	2131479	It's probably worth it.
2131960	2134741	And HungryMrCrunk says, why aren't you going to buy it?
2134982	2135242	What?
2136282	2136863	Seriously?
2137983	2138244	What?
2139484	2140025	Daytona?
2141806	2145128	I mean, there are a lot of people that probably think you're crazy for what you just said.
2145568	2146949	I at least want to rent it.
2148194	2151235	and see if I like it and get us into it as everyone else does.
2151395	2153696	So I apologize I didn't play it for this week.
2153976	2155657	I'm not buying Modern Warfare 2 either.
2156017	2156817	Ooh, I'm crazy.
2159378	2162239	And GameGuru says game of the year for Sony fanboy maybes.
2162339	2163300	Ooh, yikes.
2164400	2164980	Don't get me wrong.
2165481	2172203	It is probably going to be the best PlayStation 3 game other than Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 that comes out this year.
2174084	2174584	But that's about it.
2175616	2176826	Best Sony made game this year?
2177472	2177694	Yes.
2178676	2179777	I'll probably play it at some point.
2180497	2181858	I can never resist peer pressure.
2182179	2183300	Okay, anyway, back to release dates.
2183320	2183540	Sorry.
2184460	2186602	Going to Japan and looking at the Japanese release dates.
2187463	2193327	FIFA Soccer 10 World Class Soccer comes out in Japan as well as Forza Motorsport 3 gets its run in Japan.
2193627	2196209	Those both coming out on the 22nd of October.
2196829	2199191	Moving on over to, of course, the PlayStation 3.
2200232	2202193	FIFA Soccer 10 also comes out over there.
2202674	2205015	That's really the only major release in Japan this week on the PS3.
2206631	2211375	And moving on over to the Nintendo Wii, another port of FIFA 10 World Class Soccer.
2211655	2217699	But there's some other games there as well, including Tsukiban Satchu Rena Wii comes out on the Wii.
2218239	2225645	And I like this because the box art is like this hot pink box art, and it's just kittens all over it.
2225725	2227886	And it looks like it's like a LOLCAT game.
2227946	2228947	Like, I'm not even kidding.
2229347	2230428	Oh, my God.
2230688	2231409	I shit you not.
2231429	2231729	It's not.
2231749	2232529	It's Keyboard Cat.
2232549	2234850	There's a scene with a cat playing the piano.
2235330	2237610	It's Keyboard Cat and Lol Cat, like in a game.
2237851	2239571	That is Game of the Year right there.
2239831	2240331	I'm sorry.
2240411	2241271	Fuck Uncharted.
2241531	2241952	Fuck it.
2242452	2244172	This is the Game of the Year right here.
2245752	2247853	Why don't they release this crap over here?
2247893	2248433	D3, come on.
2249633	2252234	Dear Working Designs, come back and bring us out.
2252314	2255795	If there is a game that you need to localize for the US, it is this game.
2257042	2258543	They're dancing with kittens.
2259243	2261725	And, oh my god, is that cat shooting a laser?
2262726	2263046	Oh my god.
2263066	2264327	We have laser cats.
2265087	2266108	This is it, right here.
2266648	2268389	Again, I'm going to say this name again.
2268409	2269290	Rob, email me that link.
2270610	2271531	I'm going to order that game.
2272872	2276434	It is Sukiban Shachu Rena Wee.
2276514	2277555	Question for you, Rob.
2278195	2279516	And this sort of ties in with that.
2280276	2281677	Why don't we move back to the old studio again?
2282698	2283098	I don't know.
2283839	2284459	Because we should.
2285253	2285533	Why?
2286114	2288597	Because I'll get that game and then we can do it on Justin TV.
2288797	2289418	Oh, I see.
2289478	2290179	Maybe at some point.
2291019	2292221	I can get that set up here.
2292401	2293122	We just need the camera.
2293976	2294636	I can get the camera.
2294656	2295036	That's easy.
2295577	2296377	Yeah, we can do it in the vault.
2296417	2297017	We'll figure it out.
2297577	2302119	But anyhow, the chat was demanding to check out that game in the chat room.
2302139	2303239	So I posted a link in chat.
2303299	2306160	I apologize to those on the podcast because I can't link it to you.
2306600	2309121	But again, that's S-U-K-E-B-A-N.
2309201	2309741	Sukiban.
2310281	2311822	S-H-A-C-H-O-U.
2312002	2312562	Shachu.
2313142	2313442	Rena.
2313602	2314282	R-E-N-A.
2314703	2314943	We.
2315283	2316703	That's the name of the game.
2316803	2319464	And it's cats, cats, and more cats.
2319524	2320444	It's an action game.
2321105	2321325	So...
2322525	2327229	I mean, seriously, how can you say Uncharted 2 is the game of the year when you have this game coming out on the Wii?
2329051	2336617	I just don't... I think it's clearly... That was a statement said without considering the rest of the year.
2337778	2342602	Well, I'm actually looking up reviews on it to make sure it's Lolcats the game.
2345104	2346025	Let us know what you find.
2346826	2348307	Okay, well, I still have to do...
2349721	2350361	Well, hold on, hold on.
2351001	2351921	I got some more releases here.
2352242	2358003	PlayStation 2, Beatmania 2DX 16 Empress is making its way out right now.
2358483	2361023	I think it was out a little early for some people.
2361183	2365704	I think it just came out in Japan this past week, but some of your import stores will finally have it in stock this week.
2365804	2373186	They know that this is one of the big games people like to import, and it's a huge release, obviously being the last 2DX game on PlayStation 2, so look for that.
2374026	2380893	On the Nintendo DS, Element Hunters comes out in Japan this week, as well as Rune Factory 3, and a game called Roller Angels.
2381633	2382094	Check that out.
2382874	2389861	And then lastly, on the Sony PSP, again, these are Japanese release dates, another release of FIFA Soccer 10.
2390481	2393524	Obviously, soccer is very big in countries that aren't the US.
2394125	2394945	And a game called...
2395706	2403752	Haru Kanaru, Toki no Naka, Day 3, Unmei no Meikyu, Aizu Ban, or Treasure Box.
2403872	2408155	And I've learned to look up these games and make sure...
2409292	2410112	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
2439249	2440095	Do they have a Twitter?
2441325	2442665	They freaking have a Twitter.
2443246	2444146	But it's all in Japanese, right?
2444166	2445586	I'm going to follow the Japanese Twitter.
2445866	2446466	Alright, you do that.
2447367	2452968	Actdeft in chat says, now the folks in chat are kind of looking at what we just posted.
2454309	2456129	Leo Shen says, I got my copy.
2456169	2459510	Oh, he might have been talking about Beatmania because I just mentioned that.
2460270	2462211	Actdeft says, best Wii game ever.
2462291	2464131	Not even Epic Mickey will surpass this game.
2464151	2468512	Okay, I found a description from the Twitter, so I'm running it through the Nifty Translator.
2468533	2470193	And we'll see what it says.
2471722	2472541	Alright, let me know what happens.
2474832	2481957	Cat President and Choking Employee Recruitment on Large Scale Famous Cat Rena of the Superman Nature Blog finally appears in the game.
2482378	2485020	Let's work also by you under the Cat President.
2485661	2486942	What the hell does that mean?
2487142	2488763	Because it's translating.
2489043	2490505	That doesn't even fucking make sense.
2490565	2491005	I love it.
2491265	2494168	So he's like the President of Cats or something?
2495309	2499012	I guess this Cat Rena is a famous cat.
2499692	2501554	I've actually heard of the cat before.
2503901	2504742	I'm getting this game.
2504842	2505202	Fuck it.
2505242	2505742	I'm getting it.
2507322	2511964	Rob, let's get the communal OLR copy and find a Wii that we can play it on.
2512484	2512944	Amazing.
2513004	2513924	Loki has one, right?
2514224	2515165	I have a Wii that I'll play.
2515505	2516225	We'll have this game.
2516305	2516645	Don't worry.
2516965	2517885	It'll be coming.
2518025	2523587	Actually, this was just sent to me in chat is that we actually have an exclusive sneak peek at the soundtrack for this game.
2523627	2524207	It's amazing.
2524587	2526688	That sounds so familiar.
2532239	2537305	Okay, the next sound you're going to hear is my microphone connecting with the back of Rob's head.
2537766	2538046	Ready?
2538807	2540950	One, two... Ow!
2544274	2547838	Anyhow, um... President Cat.
2552614	2558021	Seriously, every other podcast you listen to, every single one of them will mention Uncharted 2 this week.
2558122	2558963	And they will talk about it.
2558983	2560465	They will suck its dick to no end.
2560986	2563088	What other show are you going to hear about this game on, huh?
2564170	2564791	I challenge you.
2564891	2565512	What other show?
2566834	2568596	Watch, there's probably at least five other shows that mention it.
2568616	2569177	But seriously.
2572213	2572794	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2590972	2596117	If anyone who can read Japanese wants to follow their Twitter, it's RenaWii, R-E-N-A-W-I-I.
2596558	2599200	Someone go start translating that for me right now.
2599220	2601682	You need to tweet to them, quoting them or something.
2601843	2603184	Yeah, just tweet to them.
2607048	2608870	and say, release your game in English, please.
2609190	2609830	Best game ever.
2610271	2612272	I'm going to go on the OLR Twitter right now and tweet to them.
2612573	2614995	Actually, I'm running their Twitter through Nifty.
2615435	2625143	I love... Anyone, if you want one of the best translators from Japanese to English, seriously, just look up Nifty Globalgate.
2626104	2628386	So, yeah.
2628666	2631549	They keep calling it President Rina.
2633372	2635313	I'm going to tweet them right now from the OLR account.
2635353	2637794	Can you send me the link to their Twitter in chat?
2638034	2638234	Yeah.
2638474	2640195	And then can we do the UK releases?
2640455	2642016	Sorry, I know you're trying to do five things at once.
2643016	2643776	Where's IRC?
2643796	2644136	There it is.
2644376	2644677	Alright.
2646317	2652019	So she's going to get me the Twitter there and I'm going to tweet them from the OLR account saying we demand that you release this game in English.
2652860	2655060	I'm linking it to the main chat room too because I want everyone.
2655180	2655701	Alright, sweet.
2656441	2658242	I'm going to go tweet them right now.
2658262	2658962	We want this game.
2660242	2663344	We want President Satchel means President, by the way.
2664804	2666665	Rob, Satchel means President.
2666965	2667325	Gotcha.
2667446	2669146	Well, now I've learned a little Japanese today.
2669547	2669807	All right.
2671287	2672288	Let's do UK releases.
2673135	2675416	Okay, a ton of stuff on the 23rd.
2675456	2699864	We have Borderlands, we have CSI Deadly Intent, Fairytale Fights, Forza Motorsport 3, Ghostbusters on PSP, Grand Theft Auto Chinatown Wars on PSP, Lips, number one hits, what the fuck ever, Marvel Super Heroes Squad, Nintendo Presents Style Boutique, ew, Pro Evolution Soccer 2010, WWE Smackdown vs. Raw 2010, and that's it.
2704116	2707078	and President Cat!
2707239	2710301	I'm making an icon of President Cat.
2710861	2715165	We are talking about your game on our show right now and we demand you release it in English in the US.
2715525	2716886	President Cat for USA.
2720129	2722451	Please, retweet the fuck out of this, please.
2722771	2723131	Thank you.
2723471	2724372	I'm going to post it shortly.
2727675	2727915	Okay.
2729651	2733912	Also, if any of our listeners that speak Japanese, please retweet it to them in Japanese.
2733992	2734352	Thank you.
2736253	2737013	This needs to happen.
2737674	2738214	Alright, anyway.
2738874	2742155	There's probably some people listening to this show right now like, what are they smoking tonight?
2742175	2743115	Release date 10-22.
2744115	2747096	Countdown will deliver a picture of their cute and funny friend, Rina.
2747356	2749557	Is a marijuana farm burning in Sacramento tonight?
2749637	2750537	I mean, seriously.
2751518	2752098	What is going on?
2753118	2755979	SSJ100 Matt says, Shermie is secretary of catnip.
2757240	2758400	Dude, I love this cat.
2759192	2759412	All right.
2759852	2763835	Moving on, there's other video gaming stories, believe it or not, other than President Cat.
2763855	2764796	We will keep you posted.
2765076	2769559	Please, again, please, please, please, retweet our message to Reno We.
2769599	2770720	We want them to notice.
2771261	2771761	Please.
2772481	2772682	Okay.
2772902	2774183	We want President Cat!
2774363	2774703	All right.
2775283	2780287	In other news that's not President Cat related and unfortunately makes it less important...
2781119	2787863	is Blaze, which is a company that makes third-party peripherals for game systems like the Wii and the PlayStation 3.
2788583	2797387	Well, they have now put out a brand new motion 3D controller that looks exactly like a Wii remote.
2797928	2800529	So much so, I wouldn't be surprised if they get sued for it.
2801810	2803671	But, hey, whatever.
2803711	2806592	It says it works fine as Sega Tennis and Tiger Woods.
2808133	2808293	But,
2808962	2810903	It looks exactly like a Wii Remote.
2812985	2814206	Good luck with your lawsuit.
2817368	2820490	However... There's always a however.
2821130	2827154	However, it will not work with President Cat because President Cat is coming out on the Wii and not the PlayStation 3.
2827955	2835220	Anyway... I'm also making a call, by the way, for making President Cat be a trending topic.
2837250	2837890	I hope it works.
2838310	2839510	All right, here's the thing.
2841151	2849232	Why are they doing this when the PlayStation 3 is doing their own, and how are they possibly getting away with it without Sony bringing the SmackDown?
2849272	2855573	I mean, doesn't this kind of thing have to have some type of Sony license anyway, especially considering the fact that it works with existing games?
2855913	2856154	Maybe.
2856654	2863895	I don't know how they're doing it, but it'll be, I don't know, something that's not...
2865473	2866233	Thanks for watching!
2890956	2893257	I mean, it looks like it's missing most of the buttons on there.
2894458	2895699	So, I don't know.
2897240	2898180	I'm confused.
2900001	2908706	It just looks like a cheap knockoff, which I'm sure it is, but I still don't understand the legal end of it, like how they can possibly get away with it and how Sony is letting it happen.
2909907	2915630	I guess it looks different enough than the Wii Remote, but it's basically got the trigger underneath where the B button would normally be.
2916131	2918432	It's got the directional pad at the top, just like...
2919329	2919849	TheWeeRemote
2950414	2953356	but it looks like cheap knockoff crap and you'd better just wait for the real thing.
2953416	2960061	It's tough when they're making this controller that really serves somewhat of a purpose but it's not that important.
2960381	2969708	It's not anything like the FragFX or something like that where you're actually making something that you use a mouse to aim or something like that so it's more like a PC.
2970268	2978154	But this I guess it's more immersive for Tiger Woods but I'd really just wait for the official release
2979389	2980811	and the official thing comes out I don't know
2991465	2994547	Fantasy Star Portable 2 is going to be getting some product placement.
3011981	3014462	and it's kind of extreme.
3014863	3022446	First off, there's going to be Fanta products in the game, like the drink, you know, one of Fanta, that whole thing, are going to be showing up in Fanta.
3022466	3023327	Those are still around.
3023487	3027569	Well, you're talking about the official drink of Germany during World War II.
3027629	3028069	I guess.
3028509	3034432	But then also, something to note is that Pizza Hut branding is now going to show up in the game.
3035352	3043857	Apparently, you're actually going to be able to have pizza-related shields and swords and things of that note.
3044097	3056065	And I'm looking at the site that is running this story here, andreasang.com, A-N-D-R-A-S-A-N-G.com, and they actually have screenshots of this chick, and it doesn't look Photoshopped.
3056085	3057145	I think this is the real deal.
3057445	3058066	Oh, that's the real deal.
3058166	3061448	A little Pizza Hut box and a pizza pan.
3062577	3072760	Yes, you will actually be able to get like pizza to seafood mix pizza for $2,500 meseta and cheese and cheese pizza for $1,900 meseta will actually be available in the game.
3074640	3077201	There's a little like pizza place in the game and so forth.
3077281	3084322	So, I mean, I just don't really like get it like a that sword and shield is God awful ugly.
3085543	3086103	But, um,
3087884	3090465	I mean, what does pizza have to do with Phantasy Star?
3090505	3097187	I mean, I guess it's like product placement, just like you see in the billboards in the racing games here in the US, but it's a little extreme, don't you think?
3097568	3101089	Well, keep in mind, Sega had a whole game based around Pepsi.
3102870	3103930	This isn't far-fetched.
3105501	3106041	I guess.
3106102	3107082	Pepsi Man, Rob.
3107823	3109704	They need Pepsi Man versus Pizza Hut.
3109864	3112707	You can't help but go, okay, this is a little bit much.
3112967	3117290	Like, it's one thing in Crazy Taxi to have the KFC and Pizza Hut that you have to drop people off.
3117310	3119272	Doesn't Pepsi Cola own Pizza Hut?
3120072	3120653	I think so, yeah.
3122086	3123187	Is Pepsi going to buy Sega?
3123267	3124028	Is that where we're going?
3124248	3125670	Maybe that's just what's going to happen.
3125690	3126911	I don't know.
3126991	3132477	TigerClaw in chat says, I remember seeing Pizza Hut billboards in TMNT 2, the arcade on the NES.
3132857	3135620	Yeah, it's not that product placement in video games is anything new.
3135800	3137762	It was Domino's in the movie.
3138123	3139564	I don't know if it's often talked about.
3140592	3148995	But, I mean, when it gets in your face so much, it's like you're carrying around a giant Pizza Hut box and, I guess, hitting monsters with it or blocking their attacks with it.
3149576	3154578	I mean, it kind of starts to cross the line of WTF, LOL.
3156659	3161581	Deathwishing says the acceptable games with product placement are sports and racing games unless they're futuristic.
3161881	3164762	But if it's a shooter or RPG, no, no.
3164982	3167283	And it's not cheeseball enough to where, you know...
3167918	3179997	They really could be over the top with everything like, you know, have product placement everywhere and just like ridiculous weapons based on, you know, the golden arches or something, you know, that'd be kind of funny.
3182125	3183046	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3201202	3209625	So, you play as the cat, and you are part of a trio called Let's Going 3, so I'm guessing it'd be Ikimasu 3, I guess.
3211846	3215728	And they are a very, very popular trio of cats.
3216448	3228533	And so, Rina, who is the editor-in-chief of production of a company, I guess, that puts out Shougakugen, which is like a shoujo manga.
3229574	3230895	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
3254085	3254485	Thanks for watching!
3278703	3284521	I mean, because this is kind of like, the Wii is kind of a preposterous system to begin with.
3284842	3286426	This game just is right at home.
3287865	3290707	We need some more games that are just OMG WTF like this.
3291307	3291687	Amazing.
3291907	3295870	And Amazon JP is selling it for 4,410 yen.
3296350	3297211	When does it come out?
3297231	3299292	Oh no, duh, I just read it during Japanese releases.
3299312	3301113	It's out this week.
3301433	3302574	Someone buy me this!
3304035	3307036	Seriously, this is the type of random crap I would buy on Dreamcast.
3307517	3309438	Like, okay, I bought Super Producers.
3310258	3312360	If that game isn't random, I don't know what is.
3313080	3316102	Or like, what was it, the Roommate 202 or something?
3316122	3316202	Yeah.
3317291	3317972	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3338433	3339453	I think it's fantastic.
3340654	3345295	Okay, so Microsoft seems to think that the PS3 is screwed this year.
3345715	3348916	They think that the 360 will outsell the PS3.
3349856	3366821	Aaron Greenberg, who is the big mouth of Microsoft, is saying that when NPD releases the September sales, they expect the PS3 is going to come in with the most units sold for the month.
3367501	3377408	because of the slim release, but overall that the Xbox 360 is still going to outsell for the calendar year and for the entire system generation.
3379369	3387354	He compares it to a game of baseball where they may be ahead one inning, but it's what you get by the end of the game that's what counts.
3390417	3393138	So you may have won the battle, but you haven't won the war type of thing.
3393379	3393879	Exactly.
3394319	3395280	This is just one month.
3396645	3398586	And I have to agree with the article, this is burn.
3398946	3407189	He's quoted saying, Sony, for example, has publicly noted that they lose money on every console they sell, and with the price cut, they're now losing even more money.
3407509	3414052	So even with the PS3 in the market today at $299, you have to question if their business model is sustainable.
3416497	3416957	I don't know.
3417398	3427644	You know, as much as I think, you know, and I do admit I've been kind of in the past, especially on this show, like really slanted towards 360.
3428144	3436509	I think especially this year I have come a long way towards, and I don't mean in reporting, I mean in, you know, just what I play myself and what I've enjoyed.
3436849	3439531	I think this year especially I think PS3's gained a lot with me.
3440251	3445894	and I think, you know, kind of going into this holiday season, I think the prize drop was the best freaking thing they could do.
3446414	3462703	Let me tell you a true story, totally true, is that the other night I was eating dinner with some co-workers and the people at the table next to us, some like husbands and wives, about six of them in their mid-twenties and they were talking about
3464106	3467488	And so I couldn't help but overhear because I'm a nosy motherfucker.
3467948	3471650	So I actually heard them talking about the Xbox 360 and the PlayStation 3.
3471910	3474311	And the guy was talking about how he's going to sell back his 360.
3474732	3478073	And the one guy actually said, and it had nothing to do with the quality.
3478113	3479734	I think they were talking finances or something.
3479754	3479994	I don't know.
3480014	3480615	I didn't hear everything.
3480995	3484356	But the one guy said, well, you know, this holiday season, I kind of want to get a game system.
3484376	3487698	But I think I want to get a PlayStation 3 because, dude, it has Blu-ray.
3488899	3489419	You know, and...
3491048	3499552	And now that those systems are getting closer to the same price, you know, again, I don't think these guys were like hardcore gamers, but they are just average people I overheard at a restaurant.
3500092	3505155	I think that Blu-ray this Christmas season is going to carry a lot of weight and Microsoft's going to feel it.
3506058	3513103	But you can get a better quality Blu-ray player now for cheaper than the entire system costs.
3514284	3519327	For the cost of a good PS3 bundle, you could buy an Xbox 360 and a better Blu-ray player.
3519667	3525671	I get that, but what about that PlayStation 2 is a DVD player mentality that really helped out that system when it needed it?
3527212	3529854	You, me, the other gamers of America, we get that.
3530214	3535738	But the people that are purchasing things in mass from Walmart and Target to put under Christmas trees, are they going to get that?
3535998	3536049	Thanks for watching!
3536906	3542048	I still don't think that it's enough to save the system.
3542448	3544949	I would have to see hard numbers.
3545089	3547330	I would have to look at their financial reports.
3547370	3550811	I'd have to see what it costs to produce as a system, what their marketing costs.
3550931	3555893	Basically, I'd have to see overhead versus sales to get an idea to project.
3556473	3565937	It seems to me that they would have to sell a hell of a lot to make up past losses and their current losses for overall system sales versus the overhead.
3566894	3569836	Now, don't get me wrong, I haven't... Can you tell I've been working in finance too long?
3570216	3574819	Now, don't get me wrong, I'm not trying to say that I've suddenly, you know, hate the 360.
3574859	3575720	That's certainly not true.
3575780	3582624	I think either way, it's going to be, you know, Microsoft's going to definitely give them a run for their money, and they're probably, in the end, will still come out ahead.
3582644	3586647	But I think if they were smart, what Microsoft would do is kind of go for the jugular.
3586707	3587588	What's the biggest...
3588328	3591830	for the mass population asset of the PlayStation 3, Blu-ray.
3592131	3593432	But what does the 360 have?
3593792	3596894	Downloadable movies with Netflix, specifically.
3597394	3609362	I think if they start marketing a lot with that and their Netflix partnership, they are very likely to keep their head above water and not let Sony get them down too bad outside of just September.
3609482	3609983	But we'll see.
3610803	3612384	It's going to be a very interesting holiday season.
3612404	3613145	I can't wait to see what happens.
3613205	3614986	I know what would save the PS3, Rob.
3615847	3616027	What?
3616187	3616968	President Cat.
3617348	3617488	Shh.
3619315	3620196	Or how about Daytona?
3622297	3625159	No, President Cat.
3625500	3626460	Rina for President!
3626861	3627421	Moving on.
3628122	3630043	Loki, more video game news, please.
3630603	3631684	That doesn't have to do with cats.
3632345	3637328	Well, one thing that Sony doesn't have, unfortunately, is the Ballad of Gay Tony.
3638049	3640311	And that will be coming out, actually, next week.
3641856	3643037	Well, 29th, I guess, two weeks.
3644778	3651203	They did release some new information regarding the multiplayer in the new episode for the 360.
3653085	3660711	Some of the things that they get, new areas to have deathmatch and team deathmatches, including some new enclosed areas as well.
3662453	3663514	Some that are actually...
3665177	3683616	in the clubs, they have most of the deathmatch maps that are out there right now for Grand Theft Auto were all just pretty much spots in the city but these are actually in addition to that stuff at least I hope it's in addition to that and not just replacing it because that would really suck if they did replace it
3686133	3692059	Some other new things adding to Deathmatch other than just locations.
3692519	3704792	They have killstreak bonuses where if you kill 3 people, 5 people, or 10 people in a row you get health and armor bonuses and also if someone kills you breaking your streak they will earn $125 instead of just $100.
3707875	3716720	Also, for assists, where you do damage to somebody and someone else takes the kill for it, you also make $25 for that, whereas before you made nothing.
3718041	3722043	And, of course, they have new weapon classes to break things apart.
3722123	3726986	They've got episodic, automatic, sniper rifles, explosives, and sticky bombs.
3727507	3729448	I'm kind of interested about the episodic.
3729488	3731489	Lol, Gay Tony has sticky bombs.
3733749	3734310	Ha ha ha.
3734670	3746401	Yeah, I'm interested to see, though, if they actually, since it does have episodic, if it will include both the first and second episodes, which would be pretty awesome if they had some sort of cross-play with that.
3747562	3758693	Free mode, they've added some new options, including the ability to use the parachutes in the game, and of course your tanks and the new buzzard attack helicopter, which is pretty awesome.
3761047	3789001	and that's pretty much it for right now but very excited about this new expansion coming out okay so I have to admit like as somebody who doesn't really play a lot of Grand Theft Auto a lot of that was blah blah blah to me so you have to kind of translate is this going to be a good thing for the game yes it's gonna be awesome it's gonna basically enhance multiplayer a lot and bring it to the over-the-topness of the other Grand Theft Auto games all right and that's what people love about it right yes all right um
3789628	3790429	Left 4 Dead 2 Boycott Group
3805770	3808632	And this has to do with one of the co-founders, Agent of Chaos.
3808872	3812795	You might remember a couple weeks ago we talked about how they actually got invited to Valve's headquarters and so forth.
3812815	3819299	And we were kind of joking, oh, sold out and all this stuff, which certainly the community was accusing them of.
3819860	3823862	But they said, quote, our goal wasn't to steer people away from Left 4 Dead 2.
3824683	3828265	It was to get Valve's attention and have them support Left 4 Dead.
3828886	3834990	So apparently since they have continued to support Left 4 Dead with content, they have declared the boycott over.
3835710	3837752	The Boycott was a little silly.
3856325	3860146	Do you think they'll continue to support Left 4 Dead 1 even while Left 4 Dead 2 is out?
3860226	3863447	I mean, EverQuest 1 still got upgrade packs and EverQuest 2 is out.
3863467	3863687	Maybe.
3864027	3864587	I don't know.
3864687	3864987	Maybe.
3865367	3865827	You never know.
3866887	3872709	Well, you know, I never understood the boycott to begin with, so I can't say this is... Well, actually, it is surprising.
3872769	3874629	You don't usually hear about boycotts coming to an end.
3875009	3877530	You just hear about, come to my online petition and sign it.
3877590	3885852	So I guess I have to say I haven't really heard that before, but it is kind of lol-tastic that those guys actually went out to Valve and now they're canceling their boycott, but, you know, whatever.
3887236	3888037	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3917219	3917759	Who cares?
3918220	3919800	You buy it or you don't buy it.
3920601	3921481	That's it.
3922202	3924063	And you'll bitch and moan about it all you want.
3924503	3926404	And post to the internet on your favorite forum.
3926504	3927925	Yeah, post to the internet.
3928005	3929926	Complain that it's not President Cat.
3930326	3935929	And then you'll just buy it anyways because you're a consumer whore.
3936689	3937049	And how.
3938720	3939381	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3963257	3964658	Fine, you swam.
3964778	3965499	I don't know what you did.
3965659	3966459	Whatever you did.
3966619	3969842	The classic game is... Dude, you're way in there.
3970322	3971083	It's Hexen.
3972944	3975306	Not Heretic, but Hexen.
3976306	3981110	And this is actually the best quality of music I can find other than having the... Punch.
3981590	3981991	Smack.
3982051	3982391	Chicken.
3983952	3991237	So yeah, Hexen is a first-person shooter that was put up by Raven and published by ID... ID...
3993999	4007764	And it's actually a sequel to Heretic, however it has better points to it, which makes me really put it over the first one that came out.
4008324	4010525	There were PlayStation Saturn and N64 versions.
4013446	4017588	But the N64 one was the only really good one that came out.
4017708	4019389	It was the best conversion.
4020069	4024952	The Saturn and PlayStation ones actually had some... They were only one player and had some frame rate losses.
4026112	4030595	So anyway, you are playing as Kronos, who is...
4034523	4036305	DarkSakura, DarkSakura S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
4054867	4056709	So it's, you know, it's first person.
4056909	4063817	It's, you go through these, you know, sprightly, fake 3D places and smite things.
4064418	4065659	It was Doom with magic.
4065919	4066760	It was Doom with magic.
4066820	4069223	And actually, Hexen uses the Doom engine.
4070720	4071400	So you can jump.
4072061	4072721	You can jump.
4073141	4075903	You also have a hub system of level progression.
4076923	4083967	And, um, this one actually had, where the previous ones used all MIDI music, this one actually used, um, full Redbook audio.
4084027	4084087	Um...
4088757	4096783	You've got moving walls in the game, so they actually had to modify Doom's engine.
4097524	4105050	Also, the source code was released in 2008, so now you can get Hexen for Linux, which is pretty good.
4105530	4109353	And also, it's compatible with a lot of the Doom source ports.
4110414	4115197	Um, there was an expansion pack called Death Kings of the Dark Citadel.
4116218	4121081	And, um, you could have, uh, it had 20 new levels and deathmatch levels.
4122282	4127225	And, um, you actually had to, uh, either buy it in store or buy mail order.
4128186	4128266	Um...
4130287	4131928	It's just a really good game.
4131948	4137010	It actually had some of the best cheats ever in it.
4137030	4139231	The NRA code was all weapons.
4140611	4140871	Nice.
4140891	4143292	You can turn yourself into a chicken.
4144313	4146234	Seriously, you can turn yourself into a chicken.
4146254	4147254	It's the anti-Zelda.
4147594	4149555	It was a fun game.
4150513	4157039	And I know you usually don't like first-person shooters because they make you sick because they're so realistic, but this was like right before.
4157339	4158640	Yeah, sprite-based isn't as bad.
4158740	4160041	It didn't really make me all that motion sick.
4160101	4168008	I mean, I'd have to stop because I'd get headaches, but it didn't really make me full-on sick to my stomach, ready to throw up, you know, on the cat or anything.
4169009	4169289	All right.
4169653	4174874	There you go, kids, your classic game of the week, Hexen from id, which you can still get.
4174914	4177455	In fact, someone in chat was saying they were just playing it earlier today.
4178135	4178975	Who was saying that?
4179075	4180376	I just saw it in chat a minute ago.
4183136	4184557	Gosh, I'm behind on chat or something.
4185297	4186337	Sorry, somebody had said they were playing.
4186377	4186757	Oh, there it is.
4186797	4189238	Frisbee says, I was just playing this online today through Skulltag.
4189678	4191659	So you can play it, I guess, online in different places.
4192759	4193239	So check it out.
4196092	4199054	Deathwishing, I guess, hasn't heard the chat on the show before.
4199434	4202116	Wants to know, how do you get sick from playing first-person shooters?
4203277	4203997	It's called vertigo.
4205738	4209501	I have a friend at work who has that real bad, too.
4209741	4210601	She can't get on boats.
4211482	4212382	It makes her very sick.
4213523	4216105	I really don't know what it is.
4216165	4218826	It's something between the eye and inner ear, I guess.
4219927	4221068	It's like, I guess...
4222953	4236720	I think it's that your brain starts compensating for the motion that it sees when your body isn't feeling the same motion and it causes a conflict in your balance and that just makes me sick right away.
4237201	4240943	Also, another thing that will do it to me is rendering errors.
4241603	4251168	When Sonic Adventure, when the Japanese version had all those bad rendering errors and the collision detection wasn't bad and you could actually see through the wall at some points and see the edge...
4251588	4252769	I couldn't process it.
4252969	4253869	It would just stop.
4254530	4258151	I would literally have to close my eyes because it would make my head hurt.
4259212	4261553	Hungry Mr. Crunk in chat says, I can't play Spyro.
4261593	4262113	I get sick.
4262153	4264635	Well, is that motion sickness or just because you're playing Spyro?
4266375	4269137	Brad from PodCulture says, well, Vertigo is a good flick.
4270620	4272341	Vertigo, shoot.
4272521	4285085	It's a good movie, but... I did know who did the opening credits for that, too, because we studied it in my typography, or my graphic design class, because the opening titles to it were so amazing.
4285565	4286786	Wasn't it the same as Psycho?
4286986	4288126	I think it was Saul Bass.
4288286	4292928	Saul Bass is seriously the best movie title designer ever, but I digress.
4294195	4296539	Deathwishing just seems to think it's bad games that make you sick.
4297240	4304852	Well, Goldeneye, which is supposed to be one of the best N64 first-person shooters, made me really sick.
4304972	4306134	I couldn't play Unreal.
4309779	4311421	I couldn't play Portal.
4311501	4312202	Oh my god.
4312942	4315064	You want to see me just get so sick?
4315285	4316606	Dan had to play through Portal for me.
4317287	4318168	I would tell him what to do.
4318188	4319008	So that he could look away?
4319829	4327577	I would tell him how to pass... Because I could easily see how to pass all of the puzzles and everything.
4328017	4333202	But I would literally have to tell him because the moment that I held the controller in my hand and actually looked at the screen to do it...
4333963	4334544	I would be sick.
4334584	4335366	Katamari does it.
4335566	4336848	Katamari makes me really sick.
4337329	4340334	I can't play more than two levels before I get way too ill to keep playing.
4340535	4341075	That sucks.
4341837	4344822	Alright, well, hopefully they'll come out with an app for that.
4344842	4345904	I didn't do it on my iPhone.
4347926	4348406	Well, iPhone's so tiny.
4348466	4349507	I didn't get that sick on my iPhone.
4349547	4350708	You probably don't get as immersed there.
4351990	4353871	SSJ100MAT does confirm it's Saul Bass.
4354131	4355052	Yeah.
4355152	4357314	I knew it was Saul Bass.
4357394	4364221	Alright, for anyone who ever wanted to know, I don't know if you do, but Saul Bass is one of my designer heroes.
4364581	4368665	So, just go watch the opening credits for The Man with the Golden Arm and you'll know.
4369827	4370087	Stay tuned!
4402912	4403352	Orange Lounge Radio
4425663	4429504	Yes, that Paul Van Dyke track, the one we played, absolutely awesome.
4429524	4433044	They had a demo online, or like a little clip online, their YouTube channel.
4433825	4437125	I just love that song, and I couldn't wait to play it, and it's really hard.
4437825	4441546	Yeah, that was a... It has a lot of cross-fading in there, and it's really hard.
4441946	4449747	I was actually able to listen on the iPhone app for all games, which, by the way, if you own an iPhone and you don't have this app, it's awesome.
4450108	4452568	You should check it out at allgames.com.
4452928	4453428	DarkSakura.com
4488922	4491003	We have breaking news developing right now.
4491244	4499469	The folks at Reno Wii, the President Cat game that we were laughing hysterically at in Part A, they have responded on their Twitter.
4499930	4501031	And boy, have they ever.
4501551	4504313	I don't think they know what the hell is going on right now.
4504733	4510397	They responded to one of our listeners, Technicolor, who tweeted our message that said, please release this game in the USA.
4510817	4511538	They said, really?
4511678	4512419	I'm so excited.
4512499	4513139	Is this spam?
4513519	4515421	So, A, we know they speak English.
4515621	4518523	Even though they've been tweeting in Japanese, somebody over there speaks English.
4518863	4521605	and then they tweeted to us and some other listeners, can I ask one question?
4521645	4522686	How do you know this game?
4523247	4526189	And I think somebody said back to them that they were hearing it here on Orange Launch Radio.
4526229	4528050	They tweeted back, oh my goodness, really?
4528411	4529291	Thank you so much.
4529631	4531713	I'm talking about this with coworkers right now.
4531753	4532714	They are all excited.
4533895	4536917	If this information on some website, let me know the URL.
4536977	4537838	Please retweet.
4537878	4540160	And they've been corresponding with one of our listeners on Twitter.
4540280	4541961	Edmund Liu, I guess, has been helping them out.
4542621	4542742	And...
4544474	4550456	They told them that we were getting it from PlayAsia.com, the release dates, which is where I read the Japanese release dates from.
4551056	4553557	And they responded, thank you so much.
4554277	4556558	And they retweeted so that all their followers could see it.
4556638	4560239	OLR talked about it on their radio show, and it really looks like an interesting game to play.
4560900	4563620	And then they said, thanks, is this popular in the USA?
4563700	4564741	Sorry for many questions.
4565061	4570243	So in the scope of just that time that Loki was playing DJ Hero during the break, they've tweeted six times about this...
4571463	4599303	President Cat takes over the USA tonight live on Orange Lounge Radio thing going on I also replied to that last thing saying that that yeah some gamers like that kind of thing stuff other than the sports and the typical RPG and that I personally love those kinds of games oh and oh they just less than a minute ago they have responded to one of my tweets because I wrote them back saying we found it on our weekly Japanese release date reading and think we need more low cat inspired games how can we help get game in USA and
4599551	4599911	DarkSakura.com
4624993	4626694	Sorry for the dead air, so I'm tweeting back right now.
4626794	4631116	Yes, game in English and playable on our American Wiis.
4631336	4633877	The chat room is shouting, get them on the show, get them on the show.
4634977	4638118	I don't know if Japan can call our 800 numbers.
4638139	4640980	I have a friend that lives in Japan.
4642202	4644503	Who is currently, you know Julie?
4645083	4645323	Yeah.
4645423	4646623	Julie is in Japan right now.
4647203	4648304	Julie is with Krista.
4648724	4650224	Krista speaks fluent Japanese.
4650324	4653205	I wonder if we can get them on Skype or something.
4653305	4653585	I don't know.
4653625	4654025	I'll tell them.
4654365	4656306	They added us back so I can direct message them.
4656326	4657526	So I'll tell them to email me.
4657566	4659986	I don't want to do anything tonight because it's all panning out too fast.
4660326	4661787	But we'll try to get them on a future show.
4661967	4663587	I am going to love this.
4664167	4665628	AlphaKananaGram in chat says...
4666789	4668950	This is one kick-ass episode of OLR.
4669410	4670251	Let me put it this way, okay?
4670791	4677955	There's many companies out there like Tomo, well, not necessarily Tomo, but was it UFO Interactive Games and stuff like that?
4677995	4680336	They port really obscure shit.
4680756	4683397	I mean, just really obscure Japanese RPGs.
4683857	4689120	Or not even Japanese RPGs, like Japanese shooters and just weird games for budget prices.
4689780	4691721	One of these companies could easily pick this game up.
4692042	4694723	It's just whether they think they can actually sell some copies of it.
4695183	4696263	They just tweeted it again.
4696383	4699504	And keep in mind, it's like noon in Japan on a Monday morning right now, right?
4699524	4701024	Because they're across on the other side of the dateline.
4701044	4702144	So it's probably about noon right there.
4702544	4704865	And they just tweeted again, great people, awesome.
4704885	4708165	And they put, at OLR, there are many piano-playing, cat-loving people.
4708245	4709526	Because that's what I said to them.
4712026	4712986	So this is amazing.
4713086	4714826	So we're going to correspond with them.
4714846	4721168	If they could do a viral advertisement or whatever with Keyboard Cat, I think they could have something.
4721188	4723968	It could get the whole mame-loving people involved.
4724619	4726100	Especially if the price is right, you know?
4726120	4728963	Let me see if she's online.
4729003	4729143	Anyhow.
4750771	4751892	Anyhow, I don't know what we have to do.
4751912	4754313	If we're going to have to do one of those silly online petitions or what.
4754373	4755975	But meanwhile, we have a show to do.
4756375	4757556	We've got to get to Twitter topics.
4758436	4758796	Here's the thing.
4758876	4763500	I am not prepared for Twitter topics because usually I can just click on the at OLR messages and they're all right there.
4763560	4766562	But tonight, because of President Cat, our Twitter is full.
4766662	4767642	So I need to go back a little bit.
4767882	4769484	I'm going to mix things up a little.
4769824	4770164	Why not?
4770244	4770744	It's one of those nights.
4770764	4774827	I think we should put a post on the front page about bring President Cat to the U.S.
4775508	4777329	I mean, that would be awesome.
4777569	4778329	We'll figure something out.
4778730	4779190	Absolutely.
4781892	4783814	Maybe we can get some of our friends at GameBallers involved.
4783894	4784555	I don't know what we can do.
4784615	4785255	We'll figure it out.
4786036	4789780	All I know is that all unfolding live here on Sunday night might be a bit much.
4790260	4792763	So we're going to get into some Twitter topics.
4792783	4793083	I'm sorry.
4793864	4794444	Fast news.
4794985	4797147	Loki's going to cover some quick news stories for us.
4797467	4797648	Yes.
4798788	4810512	Okay, so Final Fantasy XI, the Ultimate Collection, not the first collection that they've released on PC, but probably the last, will be coming out, of course, for $20 soon.
4811012	4812693	November 10th is the date that's coming out.
4813573	4815514	And actually, that will be coming out on 360 as well.
4816554	4818455	And as you might expect, it's basically...
4819485	4821207	Final Fantasy XIV Final Fantasy XIV
4836443	4847610	Also, Zen Studios, the creators of such wonderful games like Zen Pinball, Pinball FX, and The Punisher No Mercy are releasing a brand new game to the PlayStation Network called Planet Minigolf.
4848291	4859137	It is going to be a game featuring 144 minigolf holes with several exhilarating courses around the world, they say, complete with crazy obstacles and six customizable characters.
4859998	4860858	And it looks pretty sweet.
4861979	4863520	I love me some minigolf games.
4865326	4874712	Um, finally, as rumored, um, Sony is releasing a 250 gigabyte PlayStation 3 Slim model over here in the US as well.
4875152	4881176	Um, it is coming standalone, no packing games with that, and only for $50 more than the 120 gigabyte system.
4881756	4884958	So, a $349.99 will be the price on that.
4885398	4890641	Which is not a bad deal if you're looking to really pack a lot of crap onto your PlayStation 3 hard drive.
4891502	4891602	Um...
4892679	4894826	So that'll be coming out around November 3rd.
4897481	4897781	All right.
4898302	4899783	Sorry, they wrote back again.
4900563	4902424	I hate to keep going back to this, but I'm loving this.
4903365	4904766	They're asking their boss right now.
4905687	4907248	They put, wow, ask my boss.
4907588	4908669	Ha ha, wait a minute, please.
4909349	4913372	And retweeted our message about, yes, game in English and playable on our American Wiis.
4913412	4914432	How can we help make this happen?
4914973	4922338	So some executive at some Japanese game company right now is hearing about some crappy little internet show in America that wants this damn game.
4923298	4924739	Dude, totally want President Cat.
4925060	4925580	Amazing.
4926160	4926961	I love the internet.
4927432	4931117	And hey, you know, maybe if all else fails, they'll just send us a Japanese Wii game.
4931137	4932118	Just put it on WiiWare.
4932138	4934341	I mean, honestly, it can't be that big of a game.
4934401	4936023	I mean, just put it on WiiWare.
4936063	4936924	President Cat!
4937024	4943372	Alright, well, when Twitter ladies, bosses, or guys, I don't know who it is, but when that boss gets back to them, we will have more.
4943852	4947796	Meantime, more late-breaking, well, not late-breaking, but rapid-fire news anyway.
4948917	4950398	News about Super Mario Bros.
4950478	4951780	Wii, the new one coming out.
4951840	4954162	Did you know Princess Peach is not playable in the game?
4954962	4958366	Actually, this was brought up recently in an interview with Miyamoto, and Miyamoto commented...
4958786	4960767	Is that maybe a throwback to the fact that people in Super Smash Bros.
4960787	4963349	Melee were just pausing the game to do upskirt cams on Princess Peach and Daisy?
4963369	4963689	I don't know.
4986035	4989577	But regardless, it sounds like they're trying to skirt the issue.
4990917	4992698	Mass Effect 2 now has a release date.
4992738	4998081	It's coming out in North America on January 26th, and it's coming out in Europe on the 29th.
4998781	5000202	Is there really anything else you need to know?
5000442	5002983	Well, you might want to know about the GameStop pre-order bonus that they're offering.
5004136	5005817	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5026734	5030636	Duels of the Planeswalker gets a new expansion on Xbox 360.
5031276	5036878	They think the name is Duel of the Dragons, but it is being priced only 400 Microsoft points.
5037279	5039459	It is coming out on the 21st of October.
5039500	5045002	It's going to add three playable decks and three unlockable cards for all of the original decks.
5045482	5050804	So there you go, some new expansions coming to Magic the Gathering, which hopefully you didn't forget was out there on the Wii.
5051204	5051585	Let's do...
5054042	5054783	Jamie's Stories.
5055324	5057007	We never did our closed deck tournament, Rob.
5057387	5057948	We never did.
5058008	5058469	We need to.
5059281	5064986	Well, how about some news about Alpha Protocol, which actually really isn't very much news because I think we expected it.
5065946	5071751	It is delayed instead of being out, even for Christmas, they're pushing it back to spring 2010.
5072632	5081639	But Obsidian, the developer, is actually pretty happy about that because it gives them more time to make sure it's really polished and looking the way that they want it to.
5081739	5082820	So I think that's a good thing.
5083621	5088845	I would rather wait for a good product than have to deal with substandard.
5090053	5091534	Delays aren't always a bad thing.
5091594	5093695	Delays can sometimes end out pretty good.
5094815	5100257	Also, two characters for Tatsunoko vs. Capcom have been released.
5101317	5106519	We have Condor Nojo as Joe the Condor from Gatchaman.
5106560	5109541	He was G2, the one who always wanted to fire the bird missile.
5111321	5114303	Also, just to say, for anyone who watched Battle of the Planets, it was Jason.
5114323	5118445	It was Dirk in GeForce.
5118645	5123228	Anyway, I'm the Gatchaman fangirl, so I'm very happy about this.
5123948	5124308	And then...
5125849	5127090	There's also Zero.
5127350	5131433	Zero is going to be out, as in Zero from the Mega Man X series.
5132374	5134796	So that's going to be pretty sweet.
5134916	5141861	I actually watched videos of them in motion, and it was epic.
5142161	5144643	Also, the team up with...
5146879	5153784	They had a Joe and June on one of the matches I saw and they did the Tatsumaki attack.
5153944	5154644	That was pretty cool.
5155045	5156125	That was pretty damn cool.
5156165	5157586	I'm looking so forward to this.
5158187	5160688	Except I really don't like what they did with the Tatsunoko logo in English.
5161689	5163170	It doesn't look nice.
5163410	5166032	They should have just stuck to the Japanese one.
5167492	5194633	and last but definitely not least Blur is going to be in Lego Rock Band and there are little Blur shaped Lego stick people all bricked out for Lego Rock Band so that makes me pretty happy I'm just sort of laughing at the little Damon and the little Graham I think that's pretty funny
5196659	5197320	That's just cute.
5198281	5198661	But that's it.
5200883	5201224	All right.
5202965	5204827	Moving on, we're going to get into some Twitter topics.
5204867	5205808	You guys ready to do Twitter?
5206009	5214157	I know we had a lot of Twitter tonight with what the developments with President Cat, which apparently they just posted some type of comic that has our chat room in stitches right now.
5215400	5215920	Oh, I see.
5216160	5216921	I'm loving this.
5217021	5219241	I mean, live radio doesn't... I'm serious.
5219301	5220762	We should petition this stuff.
5220902	5221902	We should send it all out.
5222002	5224083	You know, tell people why this game needs to come over here.
5225664	5226664	Well, let's wait and see how they respond.
5226704	5227744	I can actually read some of this.
5228745	5228985	Alright.
5229585	5229865	Anyhow.
5230325	5230666	I'm sorry.
5230686	5233807	I didn't mean for President Cat to take over the show, but... Goddamn.
5233827	5234707	This is cute!
5237228	5239028	OLRZO, President Cat won.
5240009	5240789	Let's just face it.
5241549	5242910	President Cat is the fourth host tonight.
5243459	5245079	Alright, Twitter topics, dammit.
5245559	5247760	Things that don't involve President Cat, believe it or not.
5248460	5251201	Questions when our tweeters give us stuff at OLR.
5251521	5255601	Deekman wants me to remind you all, you can now post pictures to the photo stream.
5256682	5266464	So if you send a picture to pics at orangelaunchradio.com, it will now go to our website at www.orangelaunchradio.com and it'll be right up there for everyone to see.
5267964	5294478	so don't send pictures of penises or I swear to God we'll remove this like that but if you have like gaming stuff you want to put or maybe it's a challenge this week to show our love for President Cat you need to upload pictures in fact we should give a challenge to the listeners every week I love this idea since President Cat has taken over the show tonight we want people to upload pictures to the stream showing their love for President Cat because this will help the developers show that they are the next big thing in the U.S.
5295663	5296604	Let's make that happen.
5323411	5325051	Other Twitter topics going on.
5326052	5326692	Oh, shoot.
5328192	5329872	I somehow accidentally clicked on an ad.
5330773	5331793	Oh, man.
5332873	5335133	No.
5335254	5336194	Advertisement fail.
5337514	5341495	Ryan Belknap wants to know, what do you guys think of Glee and Flash Forward?
5342535	5343355	I love Glee.
5343595	5344735	I think that show's amazing.
5345616	5349236	Flash Forward, I watched the first episode but wasn't able to watch anything after that.
5349556	5352397	I just haven't had time because I've been watching a bunch of other shows.
5352677	5353337	Thanks for watching!
5369824	5372845	My wife is excited about the fact that they're going to be going on tour.
5373745	5374885	So she wants to go see that.
5375725	5376865	Did that get officially announced?
5377365	5377906	I don't know.
5378206	5379406	I want to see it too if it goes on tour.
5379426	5380706	I'll take your wife if you don't want to go.
5381746	5386007	And then also, flash forward, I've actually watched.
5386127	5388048	It's good, but it's slow.
5388208	5389108	That's the only problem.
5389148	5390668	But it is getting interesting.
5391508	5392628	But it is very slow.
5393109	5395089	I like Fringe better, but I watch them both.
5396351	5397252	It's by the people who do the 4400.
5397752	5399133	But you know what I haven't been watching, though?
5399353	5400955	And I hear it's actually good this season.
5401495	5401875	Heroes.
5402996	5403316	Really?
5403336	5404477	And I stopped watching it, too.
5405038	5405818	Because I'm watching House.
5405838	5406919	Because House is on at the same time.
5406939	5407259	I'm sorry.
5407419	5407920	House wins.
5408220	5412083	Can I say, though, I got introduced to It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia the other day.
5412103	5412603	Oh, my God.
5412904	5414505	That show is fucking funny.
5414725	5416326	Oh, my God, that show is funny.
5416987	5418167	I've really been kind of...
5419068	5420069	Thank you for watching!
5440566	5441266	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5463627	5470771	Spazinator wants to know, how about the apparent leak by Naughty Dog on the official PS boards regarding cross-game chat coming to the PS3 in firmware 3.1?
5471872	5476195	Well, you kind of summed it up right there what the news story is, and all I have to say is I hope so.
5476355	5484139	I mean, sadly, as much as I've said nice things about Sony tonight, I think that they're still lagging big time in the online war.
5484860	5488602	But they're free, so I guess you get what you pay for, but this would be nice.
5488742	5489683	It's certainly a nice feature.
5489843	5490803	I mean, of course it would be.
5491404	5491544	Yeah.
5493170	5493530	Let's see.
5493650	5496411	Gamer Girl asks, what's the most fun game you've ever played?
5496732	5499613	Like so fun that when it's over you'd play it a million times no matter what.
5501394	5501934	Oh my gosh.
5504075	5506556	I don't know if I want to go like 8-bit or like newer stuff.
5508276	5510337	I can always play The Guardian Legends.
5510357	5513278	You know I talk about that game very fondly on this show and I love that game.
5513578	5514599	I can always go back to that.
5514879	5517740	If you want to go to a true 80s arcade classic, Dig Dug.
5517960	5519321	I can never stop playing Dig Dug.
5519561	5519801	Peggle.
5520506	5524328	Redertainment asks, I have a big pile of strategy guides I want to get rid of.
5524388	5525008	Suggestions?
5546880	5553403	If you have the versus Final Fantasy 7 one and it still has the poster in it and it's intact, give it to me.
5554484	5555444	Also, winter is coming.
5555464	5556585	Because I don't want to pay $100 for it on eBay.
5557748	5562130	I had that poster, but my drunk girlfriend kicked it and it accidentally ripped.
5563210	5568913	I had the strategy guide and the poster and everything, and Dan's friend ripped the cover and drew on it.
5569253	5570013	It was a long time ago.
5570573	5571133	I'm pissed off.
5571233	5574295	That particular strategy guide goes for a lot of money on eBay.
5574795	5575355	Seriously.
5576055	5577796	The versus books Final Fantasy VII one.
5578336	5579697	Reno, we just responded to you, Jamie.
5580180	5580680	Oh, Lord.
5581741	5582902	She's busy tonight.
5583002	5583322	Sorry.
5584542	5585783	It's taking over Twitter tonight.
5585903	5587404	I just, I can't help it.
5587704	5589685	Anyway, that's going to do it for Twitter topics tonight.
5589725	5590706	Sorry if you guys didn't get through.
5591346	5594548	Don't forget, you can always send us an email, mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com.
5595048	5601432	And if you're really upset your tweet didn't get through, blame President Cat, because that's been monopolizing our Twitter discussion this evening.
5601712	5602372	But I love it.
5602752	5604974	It's got a cat licking its nose.
5605034	5606154	It's so cute.
5606254	5606915	Exactly.
5608151	5610513	How about some other gaming news, Loki?
5611814	5613596	I don't know if I could do any more gaming news.
5613676	5616819	It just feels so insignificant compared to President Cat.
5617579	5618980	But anyways, we'll move on.
5620262	5626107	So apparently people are getting banned for playing pirated copies of Forza and Borderlands.
5626667	5626987	Really? !
5627881	5629602	Is that a shock to you?
5629682	5635423	That, you know, playing games that you've burned early is gonna get you banned off Xbox Live?
5635463	5636184	But yeah, that's the case.
5636624	5643186	So, apparently, if you are gonna go the illegal route with Forza Motorsports 3 and Borderlands, you might wanna wait until the game comes out.
5643806	5645246	But, um, yeah.
5645526	5654469	And it's, ironically, though, you're gonna get banned, but only your live account's gonna get banned, not your console, because they still want you to buy games, apparently.
5654729	5656610	But, um, you can always create a new live account.
5657586	5660388	Or if you're really going to play this that early, just play it offline.
5661729	5663190	Or play it on a banned console.
5664611	5668673	I heard, though, they only ban the console... Or no, they ban the account and not the console.
5668954	5670274	Yeah, the account.
5670294	5673617	In some way, they knew whether you're playing a legit game or not.
5674057	5681622	I almost picked up Borderlands early, too, but I figured I wouldn't get to it because I'd be playing DJ Hero, and that's really what's going to happen.
5681662	5685444	I'm going to wait for Borderlands to come out because I don't know when I'm going to get to it.
5685865	5686025	And...
5687352	5688213	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5714889	5716670	I hope none of my consoles get banned.
5716770	5717350	Interesting.
5717631	5724795	Of course, ironically enough, this is kind of off topic, but since I have modded consoles, I'll go ahead and talk about it.
5725535	5730098	It's not even really the fact that they're modded, it's the fact that they're older generation consoles.
5730418	5737122	I've had a 100% failure rate with Xbox 360s, the first generation of them.
5737663	5738083	I've had
5739258	5767818	and I have another one that's dead or that's gonna die it's freezing up now and it was actually one that Microsoft repaired of course I went and modded it so now they can't repair it again but anything that like the new arcade systems you know when they have the HDMI ports and stuff on them I can actually those live sort of it's just the older ones do not my sister's console which I actually have a new one coming for her
5769773	5771113	Thanks for watching!
5792286	5795167	And you know, their console's good, and I will buy another one.
5796048	5796528	Of course you will.
5796548	5797528	Because I'm a sucker like that.
5798108	5800649	Because Grand Theft Auto 4 is awesome, and I have to mod it.
5802170	5804431	Well, now, I'd be curious to know if Loki's going to buy this.
5804551	5809453	It's something for the Wii that has nothing to do with President Cat, but it does have to do with an exercise bike.
5809813	5814655	Now, I seem to remember on the show a couple weeks ago, we were talking about some type of patent for an exercise bike.
5814875	5815535	Well, it wasn't a patent.
5815555	5816256	It was a leaked...
5819317	5824219	Well, it looks like this has come to fruition because Cyber Bike Cycling Sports is coming out.
5824259	5824719	But here's the thing.
5824759	5826440	It's not from Nintendo.
5826880	5828681	It's coming from publisher Big Ben.
5829041	5832583	And it comes with a, yes, full-size exercise bike controller.
5833123	5834884	And apparently it's very easy to set up.
5834904	5836104	It has an adjustable saddle.
5836124	5837885	It has handlebars and all this.
5838345	5840606	It's also compatible with Mario Kart Wii.
5841067	5841567	Go figure.
5841607	5843988	But the game that comes with it is called Cyber Bike.
5844428	5845388	It's supposed to come out in 2010.
5847577	5848378	It looks stupid.
5849238	5849539	Okay.
5850319	5854843	The other one, which looked pretty ridiculous to begin with, had a smaller peripheral.
5855483	5858846	I mean, I could understand maybe having that because that's a little bit smaller.
5859486	5863750	Maybe there's some games that might use it later on, but this is a full fucking exercise bike.
5863790	5866892	You do not need an exercise bike to go with the damn game.
5866932	5870135	Just buy an exercise bike if you're going to buy an exercise bike.
5873137	5873437	Alright.
5873858	5873978	Um...
5876024	5877884	Moving on, DarkSakura.
5879505	5879825	Oh, yes.
5880525	5880865	I'm sorry.
5880925	5882066	I'm still... No, I know.
5882126	5884046	I'm so distracted with the Rina Wee thing, too.
5884106	5885987	They said something again to you.
5886107	5886387	To me?
5886767	5887147	I see.
5887287	5888267	I'm a little confused now.
5888307	5889528	Many follower in English.
5889768	5891288	Oh, oh, grr, my poor English.
5891988	5898190	I almost feel bad because they've got to be overwhelmed right now because their Twitter only had like 80 followers, which is fucking criminal.
5898530	5898790	Yeah.
5899290	5905432	and they've already got like 20 new followers throughout the show tonight and it's probably going to continue to grow as people listen to this podcast.
5906153	5908354	Please go follow them.
5908674	5912595	They are feeling like probably a little overwhelmed at this whole thing but people need to know.
5912775	5913916	Cats are adorable, damn it.
5914036	5914396	I know.
5914596	5915817	So if we're distracted tonight, sorry.
5915837	5916297	I'm sorry.
5916817	5923560	If Keyboard Cat can be as popular as it is, if Keyboard Cat can get referenced in Scribblenauts, there is no reason.
5923660	5926781	Okay, if they can put out all these stupid party games that don't sell...
5927603	5928183	Thanks for watching!
5953246	5959228	Alright, SJ100Matt in chat speaking of the last story says, wait, Mr. Garrison's wild wacky action bike, the game?
5960929	5965390	No, it's not that kind of peripheral, but I bet with a little duct tape you can achieve anything.
5966731	5967151	If you want.
5967671	5972633	Question is, Rob, how quick before someone tries to put their penis in it?
5974670	5977172	That is always a quintessential question here on Orange Lounge Radio.
5977452	5979554	How quick before someone tries to put their penis in it?
5980055	5982236	In the exercise bike, not long.
5982357	5988262	I mean, I don't know really where you would put your penis, but I'm sure somewhere it'll happen.
5989903	5990423	Alright, anyhow.
5991084	5992465	Sorry, DarkSakura, we keep interrupting.
5992485	5996048	I know you're trying to correspond with Rina Wee, but there is a show still to be done.
5996068	5997750	I'm just saying, thank you for being patient with us.
5997790	5998911	I wish I knew better Japanese.
6001301	6003301	Well, back to Nintendo.
6005162	6019784	Miyamoto has actually brought back a little bit more conversation in regards to HD Wii by saying that they want to support new technology as it comes out.
6021125	6027226	And he's actually even saying that if he was a consumer that had an HD TV, he'd want to play his games with nice graphics too.
6028226	6028326	Um...
6029566	6037054	So they're actually going to be moving with it as HD technology becomes more and more prevalent, which really it is.
6037294	6038776	I mean, you know what I mean?
6043801	6046924	But they are pretty...
6048749	6054515	Adamant that they're going to focus on gameplay but not close the door on HD.
6054635	6063923	In fact, there's actually some financial analysts already that are saying that it's definitely going to happen this summer.
6064864	6071811	And I think that it's... I don't really know how they're going to do it other than add-ons, but...
6073311	6079776	Well, I think, you know, we've been saying on the show for some time, the Super Wii or the Wii HD that will be backwards compatible with the original Wii.
6079796	6081337	The Wii Double D. Yeah.
6082598	6086962	The Wii with four eyes or something will, is inevitable.
6087122	6088423	It's going to happen.
6088743	6095288	I think the question is when, and certainly, you know, summer 2010, I don't need a mega expensive analyst to tell me that.
6095388	6098671	I mean, I think I said that on the show months ago, that it's probably going to happen.
6098691	6102794	Of course, I also called it for this year, so I'm not always right, but this is why I do the show for free.
6103817	6104617	I don't want another Wii HD.
6104657	6106298	I'm finding my Wii right now.
6106318	6109139	Is that just because you don't want to spend more money, or what's the deal?
6130183	6131384	No, I don't think money is an option.
6132264	6137006	The problem is I'm so jaded by what they've done so far at the Wii.
6137346	6139827	Why do I really want to go through the gamble again?
6139967	6142088	Because tonight we have seen its potential.
6142268	6144689	Listen, okay, I am checking my bank account.
6146010	6147271	Why am I checking my bank account?
6147571	6149251	Because I am buying President Cat.
6150632	6151993	This purchase is imminent, okay?
6152393	6152933	It's happening.
6152953	6153613	I'm buying it too.
6153793	6154274	I'm buying it too.
6154574	6157675	I don't even have a thing that can play it, but I'm going to buy it.
6157995	6158255	Why?
6158816	6159116	Because...
6160387	6161208	I don't know.
6161248	6162009	Don't fucking judge me.
6162049	6162610	I just want it.
6163611	6165653	I will look at the manual and purr at it or something.
6165753	6166234	I don't know.
6166414	6168096	Someday my Wii will play it.
6168136	6170418	You want to pay for my massage for me?
6170679	6171700	Get me President Cat.
6173288	6177229	Plus, I oddly want to support this.
6177409	6178329	I do too.
6178449	6179790	I hope the game doesn't stink.
6179870	6180270	Oh yeah.
6180590	6181150	I don't care.
6181170	6183031	I don't care if it stinks or not.
6183111	6187472	The whole fun is going to be the whole novelty.
6188332	6193294	Keep in mind, it's taken me a long time to actually sit and read the blog.
6193854	6195314	Just the little comics of the cat.
6195694	6196835	But it's freaking funny.
6197295	6199375	Cat's like, why am I on your t-shirt?
6199815	6200636	Pat, pat, pat.
6201416	6201736	I'm like...
6202576	6203136	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
6229193	6229553	Anyhow.
6230794	6231394	WeHD.
6231794	6232915	I think it's going to happen.
6232975	6235136	It'll be backwards compatible with all the Wii games.
6235276	6236356	It's just a matter of when.
6236676	6237757	We know it.
6238257	6238777	It's a must.
6239117	6241599	They replied and said, I wish I knew better English too.
6242719	6242879	Aww.
6244040	6245040	I just want to hug them.
6245880	6247401	You know, I am supposed to go to Japan next year.
6247441	6249242	I should offer to come give her a hug.
6249402	6249722	Or him.
6249962	6250322	I don't care.
6250803	6251743	I'll hug them, whoever they are.
6252904	6253184	Anyhow.
6254004	6254284	Loki.
6255064	6255565	Oh, I'm sorry.
6256085	6256165	Um.
6257190	6267815	So, speaking of Xbox 360 updates and possible bannings of people and stuff like that, there is another update that's going to ban stuff, and that will be, of course, the fall update.
6268315	6271397	It will be banning unauthorized memory units.
6271577	6280861	Yes, you may remember we talked a little bit about max memory units being put out by, I believe, Datel, and these will allow you to use a...
6282842	6288605	was a micro SD card and supported up to 2GB to 4GB of memory.
6289085	6292647	Which is awesome, because the Microsoft memory units are really fucking expensive.
6293627	6299690	For like $50 or $40, you get a 512MB memory unit, which is ridiculous.
6300071	6303552	Especially since, hell, you can get a 4GB USB drive for nothing.
6303572	6303612	So...
6310566	6312949	Being the greedy bastards that they are, they decided, hey, you know what?
6313469	6316713	We don't want you to sell this, and so we're going to block it.
6317033	6319336	So if you bought it, you're shit out of luck.
6320837	6322799	And there's nothing you can do about it.
6322920	6323741	But people are pissed.
6324301	6326423	But Microsoft says, who gives a shit?
6326463	6326964	It's our console.
6326984	6327665	We'll do what we want.
6327745	6328566	Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah.
6330456	6331717	I'm kind of on the fence with this.
6331817	6334759	I think they... They have the right to do it, but it's a dick move.
6334779	6338322	They have the right to do it, but it's a cock-block move is what they're doing.
6338902	6345486	It kind of sucks because the person who loses here is the consumer, not the developer of this memory unit.
6345947	6348468	They already made the money from selling it to the consumer.
6348509	6351431	It's the consumer who's shit out of luck.
6351931	6352892	If I'm understanding this right...
6353692	6359196	This isn't aimed so much as things that might be in stores, because there aren't a lot of these unauthorized things in stores.
6359397	6362619	This is aimed at people trying to jerry-rig hard drives to do everything, right?
6363520	6370105	No, this is aimed at... Well, these devices are aimed at just the consumer, but it's a cheaper alternative with more memory.
6371226	6372707	But it's not being offered by Microsoft.
6373528	6376170	And so, therefore, it goes away.
6377807	6379868	It's the same reason why there's no third-party hard drives.
6380168	6383030	Because I can tell you this much, hard drives are damn cheap.
6383270	6385751	Especially these drives they're offering for $150.
6386131	6387812	You can get a terabyte drive for $150.
6388072	6390993	I guess that's true.
6391013	6395515	I think Microsoft does kind of rip off a little bit with their storage, but this is...
6398806	6400808	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6423426	6425327	So they can block it by the device ID.
6425667	6427569	Same with controllers if they want to.
6427609	6429751	I think they can block controllers that way too.
6430731	6431172	But they don't.
6432693	6444542	But the thing is though, when the new 250GB hard drives come out, there are ways out there to make your own hard drive for the 360 by modifying a laptop hard drive.
6445363	6447585	So if you want to go through the trouble, you can do that for cheaper.
6447845	6448986	And now you can do it up to 250GB.
6451340	6452821	Super Mario Bros.
6453242	6453302	Wii
6469955	6470555	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6494332	6496553	What will happen is that then a video is going to show up.
6496713	6498314	Luigi plays through the stage.
6498674	6500195	It's not going to show you hidden paths.
6500495	6501895	It's not going to show you hidden coins.
6501995	6503696	It just kind of shows you how to get through the stage.
6504156	6506097	It will show you how the stage could be completed.
6506538	6514521	At any time, the player can jump in and take over, and then the game basically will have played you through the parts you can't get through.
6516102	6520244	If you want, though, you can just let the game complete the level for you and move on to the next stage.
6521184	6524347	Now, Miyamoto has said there are some disadvantages to using Super Guide.
6524908	6531154	If you decide not to use the Super Guide at all during the game, you stay away from the blocks and don't use them, you get something special.
6531655	6533136	Of course, that could be anything.
6533217	6535239	Could that be something new on the title screen?
6535279	6536620	Could it be an unlockable character?
6536920	6537781	Who knows what that could be.
6538322	6539983	But if you rely on them, you're going to miss out.
6540644	6542046	And, of course, you know...
6542786	6546047	Just the whole morale of the fact you had to use the Super Guide to beat the level.
6546367	6551569	A quote from Miyamoto in a little article that is running on Destructoid right now.
6552229	6557851	I find that when the Super Guide block does appear, I kind of feel regretful and guilty that I've let that happen.
6558171	6561932	So I've often found that playing the game, when that happens, it kind of inspires me to say...
6562412	6565133	I've already done this bad, now I have to clear the level on my own.
6565613	6572535	So, you know, I guess they're saying that you just feel a general sense of, well, you cheated to beat the level in order to actually get through it.
6573235	6576216	So, I don't know, what do you guys think?
6576256	6582378	Now that you hear the details on how this actually works, that it's a brick that appears if you die eight times, what do you think?
6582438	6583438	Is it still a joke?
6584079	6584659	Is it useful?
6585179	6588320	It's got a use for it, but, you know, at the same time, it's kind of...
6589420	6590841	Thanks for watching!
6611169	6612730	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
6634286	6635528	I'll talk to her President Cat
6648823	6656548	GameGuru says, Problem with Wii HD coming out before the next Xbox or PlayStation is that it won't be graphically on par with them and won't initially have the Wii's fanbase.
6656568	6660130	That's going back to a previous news story, but that's okay because I know there's a little delay.
6661051	6664273	XLink calls this Super Cheater 5000 is the name of the device.
6664773	6668035	You know, again, I think we have to remember the audience this is aimed at.
6668135	6671658	And I think for the casual player, this is...
6672972	6694402	you know, gonna be a good thing but I think for the rest of us I do really like the fact that you at least get some unlockable if you don't do it I just hope that unlockable carries some weight a little bit you know, unfortunately Wii doesn't have anything like achievements so hopefully it'll have some type of e-peen that you can show other people because who doesn't like to stroke their e-peen?
6696243	6697784	DarkSakura, don't you love to stroke your E-peen?
6698184	6698384	Yeah.
6698565	6698785	Alright.
6699165	6708891	One way DarkSakura likes to stroke her E-peen is every week she'll open up the mailbag and read some emails from our listeners at MailbagAtOrangeLoungeRadio.com So DarkSakura, please open up the mailbag.
6709812	6712093	There wasn't very much when I looked in there earlier, but maybe there is now.
6712113	6712994	There's one.
6713414	6714074	One email!
6714355	6715035	From J-Rod.
6715195	6716296	Alright, well let's read it tonight.
6716316	6717397	It's tonight's mailbag segment.
6717837	6721479	And we'll just have to roll anything that comes in now to next week.
6721679	6725502	I anticipate we're going to have a lot of President Cat emails this week, but we'll see.
6726397	6727437	Hello, OLR crew.
6728278	6733299	I currently listen to the latest podcast on the feed where Robin Loki completely trashed the PSP Go.
6733839	6741002	What everyone who badmouths the PSP Go needs to realize is that maybe the PSP Go is supposed to be a new PSP owner purchase and not an upgrade.
6741382	6747123	I never had a PSP before, but seeing all the stuff on PSN and the new PSP Go pushed me over the edge to get one finally.
6747664	6751585	It is a sleek portable and the sliding screen looks cool as hell.
6752165	6760830	Now, if I owned an older PSP, of course, I wouldn't buy the PSP Go the same way I wouldn't buy a DSi if I owned a Lite or a Phat.
6761691	6766734	I honestly don't think the PSP Go is even aimed at the current PSP owners, but new customers like myself.
6767274	6771037	So really, no need to take a shit on it, just don't buy it and enjoy your current PSPs.
6771317	6775079	This email is sponsored by the Olive Garden Home of the Reverending Salad and Breadsticks.
6775700	6777641	Um, I will say this, and this is me.
6778081	6779102	Okay, this is just me.
6781241	6791657	If I was a new customer and I was told to pick one to buy, if they were all the same price, I would pick the $3,000.
6795091	6795791	I wouldn't get a go.
6796292	6798993	And we've said on this show that the PSP 3000 is a great system.
6799213	6799794	It's pretty cool.
6799994	6804056	And the thing is, I don't understand why you would pay more money for a system that does less, basically.
6804556	6805937	That's my question.
6805997	6810720	I'm not even talking about people that own a PlayStation Portable already, because there's no reason that you need another system.
6810880	6812841	I don't understand that at all, why we would buy another one.
6813181	6816203	Why I said that, because I actually have two PSPs, but the 2000 actually had...
6817915	6819279	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
6825799	6839642	The fact is, the 3000 is cheaper, it plays the same downloadable games, plus you have the option now to purchase games that are on UMD, plus you can get memory units and stuff like that for it.
6839682	6842263	Yes, it doesn't have built-in memory, but you know what?
6842703	6847644	Memory's cheap, so it's not really worth paying the extra money for memory that's in the system.
6848004	6853405	And that sliding screen may look cool and stuff, but at the same time, I'm wondering how soon that's going to break.
6854305	6864111	and, you know, I do give them credit for the fact that they have, you know, the ability to sync up your DualShock 3 controller with it to, you know, play games when you have it hooked up to your TV.
6864551	6868694	I can't say that I've actually used that function on my PSP 2000.
6869855	6875278	I mean, I've played games on TV before, but maybe once or twice to see it, you know, check it out.
6876755	6881078	I don't know, it's just... I don't understand why you would pay more money for a system that does less.
6881318	6882739	That's basically my argument.
6882879	6888143	But hey, if you want to, and if you think it's a cool looking system or whatever, more power to you, but...
6890888	6891569	I got to try one.
6893090	6897753	A guy in my art history class had one.
6897794	6902157	Well, I didn't really sit and play on anything, but he let me hold it and push the buttons.
6902918	6905680	And I have to say that it really felt flimsy.
6906080	6906620	It felt...
6908089	6908990	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
6927196	6936122	I want to take a quick poll in here because I want to kind of address the Sony people for a minute because especially in reading some of the reviews on Twitter and so forth.
6936402	6937183	I'm sorry, not Twitter.
6937823	6941346	Twitter's on my mind tonight because of everything else going on, but iTunes and everything.
6942046	6946069	People have been unnecessarily harsh to our program because they think we're slanted against Sony.
6946469	6947550	And I want to make it very clear.
6947750	6948411	It's not the case.
6949031	6950872	We haze people when they deserve to be hazed.
6951333	6952814	And I want to prove that here with something.
6952854	6957537	And I'm not saying this particular emailer is a part of that because I know he's emailed us a bunch about various topics.
6957918	6960639	But I'm just saying, hold on a minute because it works both ways here.
6960720	6961960	Quick poll of the room.
6962521	6965123	How many of you own a DSi?
6967054	6967795	No, I don't.
6968075	6968535	I don't.
6968855	6969356	Exactly.
6969616	6971317	None of us own a DSi either.
6971717	6973258	And for many of the same reasons.
6973578	6976280	Because what's the difference between a DS and a DSi?
6976460	6977581	It has a camera.
6977861	6978322	It has a camera.
6978342	6981324	I'll get a DSi when there are more specific DSi games.
6982244	6986027	But other than that, there's no legitimate reason for me to have a DSi.
6986307	6988068	It's just it's got a camera with it.
6988268	6989909	And, you know, the price points are pretty similar.
6990410	6993972	But at the same time, it doesn't warrant me purchasing another system that plays the same games.
6993992	6995773	They put out a camera on the old...
6997294	6998995	Game Boy Color, guess who didn't buy one?
6999396	6999656	Me.
6999956	7001517	Eddie is saying two cameras.
7002198	7003318	But here's something else to consider.
7004239	7007341	If I remember right, the DSi got rid of the Game Boy Advance slot too.
7007601	7008082	Exactly.
7008102	7009002	So you can't play games.
7009643	7014906	So it's in a way almost just as bad as the PSP Go and the PSP 3000.
7014966	7018008	Here's my question that is not really being answered.
7018369	7024293	What do you get with the PSP Go that you don't get on the PSP 3000 that justifies the increased price?
7025663	7034389	At least in the DS world, you can say a camera, the downloadable game service, and the SD card support.
7034409	7035489	Okay, fair enough.
7035509	7037030	So you've named a couple things that you have with the DS.
7037331	7038451	And I even knocked on that.
7038972	7040453	It's not enough for me.
7041113	7041393	For me.
7041653	7045376	But for a new player, okay, now you have to weigh the pros and the cons.
7045676	7048217	Con, I don't get to play Game Boy Advance games anymore.
7048518	7051400	Pros, I get a camera, SD card slot, and downloadable games.
7051720	7052300	What do I want to do?
7052660	7053961	But with the PSP 3000 and the PSP Go...
7055622	7056343	You have to weigh.
7056783	7057243	Con.
7057644	7059725	It's more expensive and I lose the UMD.
7060125	7060545	Pro.
7062587	7063167	Chirp, chirp.
7063247	7063907	It's cuter.
7064788	7067890	It's sleeker looking and it's got Bluetooth support.
7068971	7069151	So?
7069893	7070874	That's it.
7071654	7079939	And with the DSi even, if you are purchasing a new system, you're probably not going to be able to buy any Game Boy Advance games anyways out there because they're not selling them anymore.
7079959	7081500	They haven't been selling them for a few years now.
7081560	7090866	So it's not going to be that big a deal if you can't have a Game Boy Advance slot on there to people that are just getting into the DS or whatever.
7090906	7092747	And the DSi would be a good purchase for them.
7094028	7097450	But if you have Game Boy Advance games and you have a DS...
7098564	7100446	Why would you go and buy another game system?
7101147	7107454	I'm glad to know it's not just us tonight because there's a little bit of DSI rabble-rabble going on in chat as well, but there is some comments.
7107874	7113440	SSJ100Matt says, Aside from them putting President Cat on DSI, I never see myself getting a DSI.
7113821	7115743	And Actdeft says, Matt, indeed.
7115803	7118065	President Cat on the DSI and I'll buy it instantly.
7118386	7119407	Which, by the way, I want to say...
7119687	7120928	How fucking adorable is this?
7121308	7124829	Actdeft tweeted the Rina Wee people to say, Hey, I'm in Mexico.
7125229	7126250	It's not just USA people.
7126290	7127590	I'm in Mexico, and I think you're great.
7128091	7129811	And they responded, Gracias.
7131032	7131652	How adorable.
7132453	7133393	I want to hug them all.
7134213	7134554	I do.
7135174	7136314	I want President Cat.
7136774	7138955	Aren't you going to be traveling to Japan?
7139136	7141236	I'm supposed to travel to Japan in June, yes.
7141417	7143918	In fact, I will be gone from the show for two or three weeks.
7144218	7144758	Take me with you.
7145838	7146339	You got money?
7146559	7148460	I'm going on a tour type thing, so we'll see.
7148480	7149240	Okay.
7149710	7151873	Rob, I have to teach you how to shop.
7151913	7153395	I'm going to teach you how to shop.
7167506	7169967	And ask for directions.
7169987	7171307	Teach me five-year-old Japanese.
7171547	7172948	I will teach you five-year-old Japanese.
7173568	7175228	Hey, I know five-year-old Japanese.
7175649	7182731	Alright, so anyway, if you want more emails, mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com Loki, we... Oh, I'm sorry.
7182811	7185272	Before we get into that, I'm just all off tonight.
7185292	7186112	It's alright.
7186172	7186952	It's President Cat.
7187652	7189173	It's not even just President Cat.
7189213	7190273	You know what started it all?
7191834	7192314	Oh, yes.
7199895	7201476	You thought I forgot about that, didn't you?
7206459	7207040	It's official.
7207180	7209041	DarkSakura is in the corner crying.
7210202	7210902	I was not.
7211062	7211683	I got you.
7211783	7213264	And I flip Rob off a lot.
7216923	7217944	This is just one of those shows.
7217964	7220425	You know, I was driving here tonight thinking, God, I'm tired.
7220465	7222066	This is just going to be a crappy show tonight.
7222246	7223387	Yeah, no, this is great.
7224067	7224787	I'm having a good time.
7225048	7229830	But I swear to God, if you make me sick, not even President Cat can help you where you're going to go.
7230471	7231451	President Cat.
7234012	7234373	Anyhow.
7234853	7236014	Rob, you know what I have?
7236034	7236794	What?
7236814	7238015	I have a case of meh.
7238775	7242338	Leo Shannon Chat says, Rob, I made that my new iPhone ringtone.
7242718	7243018	Awesome.
7243699	7245580	DJ Dark Knight says, Flying Shoe coming up.
7245760	7246001	Lol.
7246381	7248542	And X-Link says, I was also in the corner crying.
7249403	7252966	Those comments from our lovely chat room, chat.orangeloungeradio.com.
7253346	7253626	All right.
7253666	7257229	Well, maybe for those of you that are sick and tired of Daytona, this segment is just for you.
7257269	7258410	It's the F-Views of the Week.
7274161	7279344	Alright, so starting off tonight, the story that inspired our FUs of the Week.
7280224	7283306	Apparently a 15-year-old was set on fire this week.
7284107	7285147	And that's not cool.
7285167	7291431	You know, as much as we joke about fire, fire is to look at on the Indiana Jones ride and yell cool at or fuego.
7291511	7293772	You don't actually set people on fire.
7294112	7294913	That is not cool.
7296194	7321228	and unfortunately his poor kid Michael Brewer was set on fire and the reason why because Brewer owed one of the suspects who's been arrested US $40 for a video game this video game debt apparently made the suspect steal the father's bicycle Brewer reported the bicycle was stolen the suspect got arrested but the suspect was released from a detention center on Monday morning
7321688	7324251	and then Brewer was waiting for friends in an apartment complex.
7324591	7331958	The suspect, I guess, came up saying he's a snitch, a snitch and poured on him and they poured alcohol and lighter and yeah, gross.
7332459	7334561	So, I mean, just what a monster.
7335362	7336022	What an ass.
7336222	7337564	And over a video game debt.
7338684	7343767	and it prompted one sheriff to say in 31 years it's the most heinous crime I've ever seen.
7344287	7346508	All over $40 over a video game.
7347289	7353152	FU suspect whose name they clearly haven't released because he's a minor but they should so we can dedicate this segment to him.
7354012	7355133	DarkSakura, do you have any FUs of the week?
7356484	7363288	I'm actually just trying to verify that I was reading this properly, because they asked us what President Cat is, so I was going to say, doesn't that mean President?
7363828	7365309	Anyway, I'm about to say.
7365629	7376175	But, yeah, F you to my co-worker, who I refer to all the time as Mr. Annoying, for acting like a five-year-old baby and tattletailing on something that didn't involve him.
7378276	7379257	Loki, do you have any F's of the week?
7380856	7383558	My FQ of the week goes to Pushy Salesman.
7383698	7385959	Especially people that come door-to-door selling stuff.
7386379	7389341	Because I'm always a sucker and open the door, and I really shouldn't.
7390862	7394644	So we had a guy that we were looking for roof quotes because we need a new roof on our house.
7395725	7400647	And this guy came and gave us this sales pitch that took two hours.
7402488	7406891	And, well, he was really pushy and annoying, so...
7408200	7412541	It sucked, and if I hadn't answered the door, I wouldn't have to deal with it.
7412661	7415702	So, uh... F you to that, because I hate these people.
7418182	7425584	Um, my F you of the week just goes to, um... Gosh, I... Tonight I've laughed so hard, I'm actually not that angsty.
7425624	7428424	I guess my F you goes to, uh... Drama.
7430025	7430445	Drama!
7430665	7431205	In general.
7431745	7435366	Although, honestly, you know... Things are okay.
7435486	7436586	I can't complain too much.
7437031	7438533	Everything's better with President Cat.
7438573	7439053	It really is.
7439093	7442877	Although now we're defining out President... When the official people are saying, what's President Cat?
7443437	7444859	Clearly that is not the name of the game.
7444879	7447201	So I just tweeted him, do you have a better translation?
7448282	7448743	I see that.
7448783	7453508	Well, that's what... I copied the actual kanji over because... Was it sensential?
7453748	7455049	Mm-hmm.
7455530	7455910	It's like...
7457697	7464185	For example, there's a different word that's similar that means class president when you're in school and so-and-so president.
7464225	7466708	It's a different type of position.
7467329	7469672	And president would be the closest equivalent.
7471150	7471791	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7493106	7494327	That could be the cover of the game.
7495027	7496468	We're going to make that for the website.
7496508	7497028	I'm telling you.
7497828	7498448	We're going to do it.
7498789	7499869	I can't stress this enough.
7500209	7506392	Please upload your president cat or whatever the hell this game is called, your fan art, your whatever.
7506952	7515536	Put it on the OLR pics thing and then tweet it to this poor girl who doesn't know what the hell she just woke up to today here and show them the love.
7516116	7517237	Renna is the cat's name.
7517657	7517897	Okay.
7518017	7518277	Okay.
7518297	7519218	I got the Renna part.
7519278	7519558	Okay.
7520769	7525491	and Sancho would be, I guess, like company president?
7525871	7527491	Just call it Obama Cat and be done with it.
7527911	7529352	The game will sell millions of copies.
7531212	7534073	It'll be on Fox News about how it brainwashes kids and we'll laugh.
7535113	7544956	The one, Sukibon, I think, has to do with... I think it means something about female something.
7545877	7546257	I don't know.
7547377	7547737	I think.
7548317	7550078	Dark Tetsuya says, Top Cat...
7553432	7555394	Oh god, like Top Chef, Top Cat, I'd love that.
7555894	7559137	Alright, anyhow, let's move on with a couple more stories.
7559337	7561398	Okay, Sukeban means delinquent girl.
7562819	7563440	Interesting.
7563640	7564521	Or boss girl.
7564541	7566062	So is the game like Naughty Cat?
7566142	7566962	Oh, that would be amazing.
7567983	7580713	So, well, I knew that it had something to do with a girl, because it's like, I know characters who've been in series that have, like Sukeban Deka, it has to do with like a delinquent girl who uses a yo-yo as a weapon.
7581505	7586047	or like a female gang leader for a school gang.
7588007	7595630	So I'm guessing it's sort of like female boss Katrina or female boss Rina.
7596010	7597310	Kat's not actually in the name.
7598271	7598691	Interesting.
7599011	7599171	So...
7600222	7604986	Alright, well, if they should download the show and listen to it, just know we've decided that that should be the name of the game.
7605386	7605687	Alright.
7607128	7612452	Anyhow, a couple more news stories for you, and then the Skype line to say your piece on anything we've talked about tonight.
7613073	7617316	AkumaJP said something on Twitter, said that it means boss, cat boss.
7618077	7619218	Thank you, AkumaJP.
7619258	7622681	I'm so glad he's still listening, even though JustinTV hasn't been around for a while.
7623121	7625143	He's like the ambassador we need right now.
7626684	7630269	Plus, did you notice his little icon is him looking up just like Obama would?
7632692	7633433	Thank you, AkumaJP.
7635655	7643319	Let's get to a couple more stories and then we'll get to the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR for some stories.
7646161	7655386	Let's talk something else about... Let's see, we've got the possibility of a new DS on the horizon, which is interesting.
7655666	7661850	There's a rumor that the new NVIDIA Tegra chip is going into the next generation DS system.
7663393	7663974	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
7681616	7682237	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7709978	7711458	Not next year, but the year after.
7713079	7713399	I don't know.
7713499	7714099	It's interesting.
7714939	7718000	It'd be interesting to see them being on the cutting edge of portable systems.
7719241	7721621	Since their systems usually kind of... I don't know.
7722201	7722682	Well, let's see.
7722802	7726203	I mean, their last system was emulating Nintendo 64 games.
7726223	7729263	So this next handheld system should be like a GameCube in my pocket.
7729504	7729684	Yeah.
7730384	7730824	Amazing.
7732594	7733135	Wait, what'd you say?
7733155	7740901	They just posted again to all of us saying, say, really, I can't believe it, kind people, I'm impressed, and great name, thank you.
7742622	7743944	So they like President Cat.
7744604	7745385	I like it too.
7746886	7748107	Chat room, quick poll.
7748427	7751490	Who would buy a game called President Cat?
7752631	7756814	And as soon as that game comes, I'm taking a picture of my cat holding the game.
7757515	7759336	We need to take a picture of Shermie with it too.
7761454	7777905	I'm telling you, we are going to flood these people with USA love because what we're doing, this poor girl or guy does not know what they're in for because we're going to flood them with this stuff so they can take it to their people and say, look, the US is crazy about President Cat.
7778526	7779446	We need to get them.
7779706	7781568	And then they'll be like, what's President Cat?
7786973	7788274	This show is the win.
7789796	7792898	Rob, when you put this show up, subtitle it President Cat.
7792918	7794099	I'm not even going to put a description.
7794119	7797581	I'm going to say, sorry, this show was dominated by President Cat.
7799023	7801004	Anyhow, let's see.
7801324	7803286	Quick response to our poll in chat room.
7803666	7815149	Do want, arrow pointing at name, I would, yo, I will, stuff on my president cat, I would, now, 10 copies, I would, my cat wants it, I will buy 100 copies.
7815549	7817769	Giovedea is buying copies for her cats.
7818410	7822190	I haven't even played my Wii in over a year, but if I can get this game, I'll break that trend.
7822711	7824591	And my favorite, from M.A.
7824631	7828292	Satsuma, president cat is purr-fect.
7831403	7832404	That's beautiful.
7832864	7842110	And you know what I'm just hoping, though, is that I'm hoping that at least this game isn't all, like, written, that there's, like, vocal track with it, because then I could play it.
7842571	7845813	Because I read, like, seriously, I read like a five-year-old.
7846393	7847994	I know my numbers in a few other countries.
7848014	7848995	I just love the action.
7849455	7851017	I'm just worried the game sucks.
7851317	7852978	I don't care at this point.
7852998	7853778	I don't care.
7855340	7856100	It doesn't matter.
7857301	7858542	I'll get this!
7859605	7860105	Uh-oh, what?
7861006	7867030	Uh, uh, Rina, uh, PodCulture, uh, Brad, Brad just became Rina Wee's 100th follower.
7868110	7869831	We doubled their followership.
7873954	7875295	I love this show.
7875955	7877716	Some days I hate it, today I love it.
7877896	7878837	I mean, seriously, okay?
7879557	7882239	Wii Music was put out by Nintendo.
7883300	7883900	Sucked balls.
7885901	7886161	Why?
7886602	7888463	Because it did not have a cat playing the piano.
7889755	7890356	And I'm sorry.
7891016	7891677	It doesn't matter.
7892017	7893118	The game is going to be awesome.
7893218	7897162	And yes, I understand it's no Metroid Prime.
7897222	7899284	It's no Conduit or whatever.
7899344	7901126	It's not even a Super Mario Galaxy.
7901186	7901746	But you know what?
7902647	7905470	It's a motherfucking cat playing a motherfucking piano.
7905510	7906310	What else do you need?
7907151	7912256	They have games out there based on Moomin, which is like some... I don't even know what it is.
7912296	7914358	It's some character from Europe somewhere.
7915319	7915639	It's just...
7917957	7918641	We need this game.
7919064	7919466	I'm sorry.
7919506	7919908	We need this game.
7919929	7920069	I agree.
7920089	7920411	We need it.
7921196	7921558	We need it.
7922659	7922939	All right.
7924320	7928884	Anyhow, one more story for you guys, then we're going to open up the Skype line, and I can't wait to get to the calls tonight.
7929725	7931847	Castlevania, The Adventure Rebirth.
7931907	7933568	More information has been announced.
7933788	7935389	This is a game, of course, heading to WiiWare.
7935429	7936771	Tonight's been a Wii-heavy show.
7936871	7941294	We haven't had a lot of Nintendo news in a long time, but yes, of course, Castlevania Adventure Rebirth.
7941374	7943856	This was one of the games that was spoiled from the ESRB database.
7944217	7944897	It is true.
7945277	7948220	Konami hasn't really announced it, but we know it's true because you know what?
7948300	7950582	It showed up in a magazine this week in Japan.
7950942	7953344	It's coming out October 27th for 1,000 Wii Points.
7954184	7957266	And hopefully it's going to come here in time, maybe for Halloween.
7957286	7958347	That's what they're thinking at this point.
7958387	7959668	It's coming out in Japan at this time.
7959948	7961509	It looks very sexy.
7961730	7964371	It's a Game Boy game originally, but they just completely remade it.
7964431	7965192	It's now in color.
7965532	7968854	It looks a little more to me like the 16-bit era.
7968874	7971076	It looks like the Castlevania 4, Super Castlevania 4.
7971416	7971797	But like...
7972997	7973758	I don't know.
7973838	7975219	This is going to be cool.
7975399	7978501	It will have new arrangements of classic Castlevania music.
7978661	7978901	Yes!
7979822	7985245	And like the other Rebirth games that they did, they are going for a faithful 16-bit look.
7986126	7988727	What are you screaming laughing about there, DarkSakura?
7988947	7996992	I'm just looking at all of the last 50 followers of Reno E. And it's all of us.
7997793	7998213	I love it.
7998353	7998754	I love it.
8000355	8000615	Anyhow.
8001789	8002470	Can we move on?
8003250	8005132	I'm sorry, this is fantastic.
8005312	8006412	No, it's funny.
8007673	8013638	Tonight has just been a very special show, and it's about to get more specialer, as if there was such a thing.
8013658	8018882	1-877-GAME-OLR is the Skype line, or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
8019502	8020363	Let's get to the calls.
8020423	8021364	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
8021384	8021764	Who's this?
8022785	8024746	This is DSMaster26.
8024806	8029690	DSMaster, we're asking everybody tonight, President Cat, is it awesome or are we overdoing it?
8030210	8031071	Yes, I would buy it.
8032092	8032552	I would too.
8032812	8033693	Alright, what's on your mind tonight?
8035754	8037575	Oh shit, Skype crashed again.
8038935	8040136	Son of a bitch.
8041216	8042897	Skype did that last week too, didn't it?
8043637	8044398	Bad Skype.
8045598	8055343	Alright, well, this is when this is one of those rare cases where we will actually call somebody back because he did get through fair and square so we're gonna call him.
8056703	8059084	I don't know what the hell Skype did this last week too, remember?
8059484	8060285	It's just being retarded.
8061638	8062998	TigerClaw asks if I've updated it.
8063038	8063339	You know what?
8063359	8066959	I probably haven't, especially not tonight because we ran in studio very late tonight.
8067219	8068340	Hi, DSMaster, are you back?
8069500	8070480	Yeah, sorry.
8070580	8072061	I think it's something with my PSP.
8072121	8073281	No, no, it's us.
8073321	8075601	I'm going to try to log in to my 3000 call you.
8075782	8076082	Hello?
8076562	8077362	DSMaster, it's us.
8077602	8078562	Skype crashed on our end.
8079542	8080003	What's on your mind?
8080023	8080703	Oh, it's your end?
8080783	8081423	Yeah, it was our end.
8081463	8082123	What's on your mind tonight?
8083883	8087684	Not much other than I will buy President Cat when it comes out.
8087704	8087984	Me too.
8090714	8099279	Other than that, I'm here to review... My friend got an early copy of 16 Empress.
8099739	8100499	Please, go for it.
8101640	8102660	It's epic.
8103301	8104321	Tell us a little bit about the game.
8104701	8109384	Tell us a little bit about the game for those that don't know, because remember, not everybody that listens to this show is from the Bomani days.
8111025	8116888	Well, we were kind of thinking, since this is going to be the last Beatmania for PS2, we might as well get it.
8118035	8143165	and of course I don't have the phone of cash lying around so my friend bought it and so he showed me some videos and whatever and I thought this was kind of cool and now with DJ Hero coming out, the question is is that going to be the competition in Konami to run for their money along with Scratch DJ?
8143465	8145406	Do you think this is going to
8145848	8148838	you know, blow off the Beatmania fans to go get
8149721	8152963	The two games really aren't competing against each other.
8153003	8155705	I know a lot of the Bonnie community wants to think it is, but they're really not.
8177811	8186373	Because we all know that DJ Hero will come out in Japan soon, because Guitar Hero is out in Japan, I mean, as far as the on-tour games, as far as I know.
8186833	8188173	That would be true, I'll give you that.
8189714	8195955	And some of me is thinking, this is the competition for the guitar freaks, drum manias, and especially with rock band out there now, too.
8195975	8200496	I mean, Konami tried Rock Revolution, that was a crapshoot, as we all know.
8202116	8206197	And this, I think, may be their final nail in the coffin.
8207503	8218126	It doesn't say when it's going to be out over there, but it says October 2009 is the release date for DJ Hero over there, so it very well could be coming out around the same time, although, I don't know.
8219647	8223568	Alright, well, DS Master, do you have anything else quickly before we let you go?
8223588	8235812	Um, other than to say, I give 16 Empress, you know, since I'm a factor, it's probably the last beat me for the PS2, because I'm waiting for a PS3 launch before I actually buy one of those consoles.
8237172	8237252	Um,
8237950	8242592	I, it's, in the point of President Cat, it's purr-fect.
8242813	8244133	It is purr-fect.
8244233	8245694	And Skype just crashed again.
8246034	8246915	So if you can hear me.
8247075	8247195	Hello?
8247755	8247915	Yeah.
8249216	8250616	Um, Skype crashed again.
8250797	8253658	I don't know what the hell is going on tonight, but Skype crashed again.
8254198	8256880	So, sorry to DSMaster26, but at least he got his thoughts out.
8257260	8259481	So, live radio, unfortunately, this kind of stuff's gonna happen.
8259681	8260882	We got another reply from Rena Wee.
8261222	8261682	What happened now?
8261702	8263583	She says she is a bit of the queen type.
8264554	8265474	So maybe it's Queen Cat?
8265494	8266195	Queen Cat.
8266915	8269876	I don't know if Queen... I think President Cat has a better ring to it.
8269936	8270736	Or Boss Cat.
8270996	8271636	Or Boss Cat?
8271956	8273677	The boss of the cats in the house.
8273717	8274517	Almost like Top Cat.
8274737	8277638	But if you saw these games on the shelf, which one would jump out to you?
8277738	8279819	I think President Cat would jump out to you.
8280099	8281599	That shows a little bit of the U.S.
8281799	8282920	flair to it, right?
8283560	8285100	Because in Japan, they don't have a president.
8285140	8286381	They have a prime minister, correct?
8287221	8292943	Yeah, but I think that if it comes to representing the game, because you're not actually being a president president, but, you know.
8293243	8293463	Anyway.
8293871	8294531	Hi, this is Ray Iannami.
8294571	8295412	Sorry, I thought it held up.
8316334	8321277	I'm gonna have been, I just didn't really join until Part B since I was busy with homework and such.
8321657	8323618	Oh, okay, well then we'll give you a bye.
8323658	8324598	Well, what's on your mind tonight?
8326920	8333063	So, I've been looking at the 2D shooters, like, this decade, and I've been noticing a recent trend.
8333083	8338786	Like, they need to have, like, a bullet hell shooter with lots of cutesy enemy characters.
8339386	8343768	And it's kind of getting me worried about the 2D shooter genre.
8344569	8344829	Mm-hmm.
8348174	8373489	This means that more traditional shooters with starship characters are being phased out and I have friends who are mostly into stuff like Toho and Strike Witches and Death's Mouth and all those other moe it, moe it shooters and I have a feeling that if I were to show them something like Archive or Thunder Force they'd probably say no.
8374794	8377536	and one offer them playing whatever they want.
8377636	8388484	It makes you realize in the future if all you're ever going to see a shooter is going to be nothing but cutesy bullet hole shooters that are all like copping topics of each other.
8390365	8391826	Let's say you were a game designer.
8391987	8394388	What would you do to make a 2D shooter interesting?
8398992	8403315	Interesting as in like get people to imitate
8405117	8411982	Like, if I was making a shooter that was more of the aforementioned traditional shooter, like, how to make it more interesting?
8414304	8415025	I'm sorry, I missed that.
8415065	8415265	What?
8417587	8421209	What do you mean by how to make a shooter interesting?
8421509	8430997	Well, I know... Like, because, you know, you kind of are saying that a lot of the games are kind of copies of each other, so what would you do to kind of break the mold?
8433479	8433819	Hmm...
8435069	8451394	Well, as I mentioned, I want to make more shooters that don't have lots of worlds, but something that makes the game challenging, other than really pretty board patterns.
8451595	8455716	Something that's more of a comeback to a more traditional sort of graduate rebirth.
8457421	8460122	Gradius Rebirth is pretty cool.
8460142	8462603	I like these Rebirth series that Konami's doing recently.
8462623	8465104	Did you just hear us talking about Castlevania Rebirth?
8466645	8467365	Yeah, I did.
8467845	8468465	What do you think of that?
8468505	8469186	Is that going to be interesting?
8469206	8471847	I know it's not a shooter, but I figure you're a fan of that series too.
8473127	8476428	Yeah, I'm a Castlevania fan too.
8476889	8482951	I've played most of the Metroidvania and some of the older Castlevania games.
8485126	8486087	I'm going to give it a shot.
8486127	8492055	It depends on what element it decides to borrow from past games.
8492075	8493777	Take care, buddy.
8504580	8507502	1-877-GAME-OLR, username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
8508182	8509863	We're going to take your calls right now.
8509883	8512505	And, of course, we are polling all the callers tonight about President Cat.
8513465	8514346	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
8514366	8514726	Who's this?
8516247	8517548	Hi, this is Spazinator.
8517568	8518328	Hey, Spazinator.
8518348	8518928	How you doing?
8520429	8521850	Oh, pretty good.
8521890	8524531	How's everything over in President Catland?
8524731	8525992	Yes, wonderful.
8526032	8531055	And we have to ask you, are you interested in buying President Cat or are we making too big of a deal out of it?
8532698	8536641	Um, I might get it, assuming that I ever do get a Wii.
8537402	8545588	Um, you know, the Wii's only, you know, our current console, our current console I don't have yet, but I may get a Wii just for President Cat.
8545949	8547250	Alright, I'm just going to put you down to see yes.
8547650	8549171	Alright, uh, what's on your mind tonight?
8550632	8558018	Oh, yeah, I don't know if you saw one of my earlier tweets today before your show went live, but, um, I had asked, uh,
8559580	8566202	The three of you, if you have seen Detuned on the PlayStation Network store yet.
8566322	8569223	I have not seen this, but I know you were tweeting some things about it.
8569263	8570044	What's this all about?
8572244	8584889	It simply puts like a cross between Lingering Shadows, which has been on the store for forever, and Music Visualizer, so
8587023	8592847	It's kind of both or two things together and that's what Detuned is.
8593828	8599832	It's not actually a game, it's like part art, part music visualizer.
8600173	8607858	And like any other game, like a game for the PS3, it also has trophies.
8608779	8615404	So if you're kind of like bored of your music visualizers on the PS3,
8616864	8621087	and, you know, you need something else to look at.
8621307	8626930	If you're a trophy whore, then I suggest getting it detuned.
8626990	8628291	Is there a demo that I can check out?
8630612	8637457	Not yet, but I would imagine that probably they may come up with one soon.
8638137	8639578	When exactly, I don't know.
8640967	8644430	I'm trying to see if maybe there's like a YouTube or something I can kind of check out here.
8645951	8651415	I'm looking, I actually just loaded up somebody's video that looks like they shot their TV to show this game.
8652155	8654597	And I'm trying to look at a little bit of the game in action here.
8654977	8656178	So I can kind of see what it looks like.
8657259	8660361	But this looks like a very... Oh, this looks crazy.
8661422	8666486	Dude, there's like elephant... Maybe President Cat needs to go to PlayStation Network.
8666526	8668247	Seriously, if this game's on it, I don't know.
8670171	8697091	Yeah, uh, and also, um, the only thing I mentioned in the same tweet is that I know you kind of talked on it earlier, and I know you're not exactly that action-y, platform-y type of gamer, but, you know, um, Uncharted 2 is, uh, one of the more recent games that I got, and I swear to God, it is pretty good, um,
8699095	8722112	and um you know you know you know if you like um you know the Indiana Jones type type of uh stuff you know you know I would suggest getting it um you know you know you're seeing that uh every uh you know major company out there that does uh
8722609	8724930	The reviews gave it basically perfect.
8725170	8725730	I know, I saw it.
8726211	8727871	The reviews are nothing but positive.
8727911	8729072	I'm sure the game's great.
8729152	8730892	It's just, you know, I don't usually play those type of games.
8731173	8734394	But I probably will check it out right after I get President Cat, okay?
8735694	8735935	Sure.
8736195	8736455	All right.
8736975	8737675	Take care, buddy.
8737715	8739076	We're going to let you go so we can get some more calls.
8739156	8739616	Have a good one.
8739636	8741797	I have to hear that.
8741817	8743618	Yes, you too.
8743658	8743938	Later.
8743958	8744658	1877 Game OLR.
8744678	8745659	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
8745679	8746079	Who's this?
8746859	8747759	It's Legend of Zaku.
8747839	8749380	Zaku, you know what I'm going to ask you first.
8749520	8751341	President Cat, yay or nay?
8752714	8752994	DeVirginized
8772006	8775048	Um, let's say, um, I had to fake an orgasm.
8775888	8776068	Nice.
8776088	8777189	That's pretty standard.
8777229	8779150	That's, yeah, I've actually seen the show in New York.
8779170	8782311	At least you didn't have to do the, at least you didn't have to do the Twinkie or Banana Blowjob.
8782732	8784893	Did you, uh, did you have a good time?
8785593	8787254	It was pretty good, to be honest with you.
8788114	8793177	So, yeah, aside from that, I'm just, you know, just like mulling over the things.
8793652	8799496	you know, the bullshit decision that Infinity Ward made over the weekend regarding Modern Warfare 2 PC and what's that?
8801138	8810885	killing off dedicated servers basically making the whole game a living hell for clans and the ability to mob the hell out of it
8813338	8815438	This seems to be a trend this year with PC games.
8815538	8820760	The only reason why I say that is because remember what a hizzy fit everybody went into over StarCraft 2?
8821121	8822741	You can't play on LANs right now?
8823081	8829184	It seems like all these game companies want to centralize things on their own servers for various reasons.
8829564	8832065	Well, it's not even that.
8832125	8837127	It's just that they're introducing matchmaking as an integral part of Modern Warfare 2.
8837507	8839688	Basically, bringing it down to the level...
8841220	8841420	XBOX 5
8868439	8895748	and you know basically kills off any aspect of gaming playing against like more than 16 people at the same time and I mean the fact of the matter is that dedicated servers pretty much has always been the norm for PC games for the most part I mean growing up playing on like Quake 2 for example on dedicated servers and the
8896636	8898377	I don't know, I guess they're going ass-backwards.
8898777	8903240	I guess Infinity Ward's trying to, like, being, like, regressive regarding this.
8903660	8904881	And it's pissing off a lot of people.
8904901	8907362	A lot of people are canceling their pre-orders.
8908443	8912425	So, either that or they're being kept in the dark.
8914745	8919611	My God, are you tearing your computer apart during the show?
8920351	8921733	No, no, no, no, no.
8922314	8928160	I mean, I was going to get Modern Warfare 2, but after reading this, I'm kind of questioning that thought.
8928598	8931740	That notion of actually investing in that game.
8932240	8937043	It's tough for me, Zaku, because you know Modern Warfare isn't the type of game I would usually play.
8937563	8941225	But, you know, obviously I know it's going to be epic, especially for fans of that genre.
8941245	8943947	I'm not going to knock it because it sets trends.
8944347	8946949	But I can see where people are getting a little irritated.
8947029	8952332	But really, you're going to go without the game completely when it's going to be probably this year's biggest game?
8952812	8956914	I understand that it's supposed to be Halo and all the other...
8958195	8959015	Subtitles by the Amara.org community
8981984	8983486	It kind of turns me off.
8983906	8987949	I mean, I went through the same thing when playing Call of Duty 4 on 360.
8988290	9001080	It was just a lot of asshattery and it just didn't feel right when I should be playing that game on my PC with a decent server where everyone at least knows who you are.
9002542	9002842	Alright.
9003702	9005944	Zaku, any quick thoughts before we move on to some more calls?
9006945	9008907	Infinity Ward needs to either
9009673	9014796	Release more information or just like really rethink about what they just said about what they're planning to do.
9015397	9020720	Because they already lost one sale out of probably thousands, if not millions.
9021121	9023262	At least that's money you can invest in a present cap.
9023923	9024203	All right.
9024663	9025644	Take care, Saku.
9025664	9026204	Have a good night.
9026905	9027425	Have a good one.
9028078	9030259	Speaking of President Cat, the updates keep coming.
9030299	9032799	They're trying to explain to us what it is.
9033259	9036480	And basically, they tweeted us to this Google image search.
9036800	9037220	Hey, that's you.
9037280	9038600	It shows us what the Tsukibon is.
9038760	9039941	That was Yo-Yo Cop Girl.
9040561	9044162	Well, that's completely mistranslated.
9044182	9046102	Tsukibon, that's a word I knew.
9046722	9048783	Because, like I said, it means a boss girl.
9048843	9050123	And that's the typical look.
9050303	9053144	Okay, Rob, did you ever play Project Justice?
9053404	9053544	No.
9053724	9054164	Okay.
9054864	9063865	Well, there's a character in that called Zaki who wore the long skirt and everything with her uniform and it's like a girl gang leader.
9064855	9070500	So, maybe they need to call the game Mistress Cat, because these look like a mistress.
9070721	9076065	But I just like the name President Cat, and I do want to point out, in all these pictures, look at the colors the Tsukibon are wearing.
9076506	9078067	Red, white, and blue.
9078207	9078608	Am I right?
9079068	9079469	Am I right?
9079489	9081671	That's just typical uniform colors, though.
9081691	9084493	Coincidence or not, it's funny and adds to the cause.
9084533	9085614	I still like the name President Cat.
9085734	9089017	At any rate, I think the best way to describe the title of the game, because...
9089898	9095000	It's basically, we've been going, and I said, oh, she controls the house, and they were going, no, she controls the office.
9095060	9102283	So I think it's like, she is sort of like the real leader of the office, you know what I mean?
9102323	9104164	Like, Shermie's the real princess of the house.
9105184	9108645	She inserts her own control over the house.
9108805	9111566	More calls at 1-877-GAME-OLR.
9112047	9114247	Loki, do you have any last minute stories?
9114287	9115528	I see you looking at something about...
9115848	9119312	Oh, I was just doing a search for the cat thing, and there's someone talking about it.
9119332	9120653	They thought it was a Dreamcast game.
9121013	9124617	It's the NTSC-UK forums.
9125278	9126239	We're talking about the cat game.
9126259	9132305	They call it the Dreamcast cat game because it has a little Dreamcast swirl on it.
9132325	9133466	Spirals on our cheeks for the blush.
9133486	9135988	Well, did you respond and say it's fucking President Cat?
9136028	9136629	Now, salute.
9137737	9138498	No, I didn't say that.
9138758	9150965	However, I did notice that there was someone that posted on the GameFAQs forum, the only post, I suspect, Actdeft, that said, President Cat for 2012, you know you want or something.
9151745	9152506	I love that idea.
9152606	9155828	Go flood the GameFAQs forums with President Cat love.
9157108	9159129	That is the most awesome Tsukibandeka picture ever.
9159469	9172293	And I understand that, you know, President Cat isn't necessarily what it translates into, but, you know, bossy or authoritative female cat just doesn't have the same ring as President Cat.
9172313	9176295	And the president of a company, CEO Cat, I mean... Yeah, exactly.
9176455	9178055	I think President Cat has the best ring to it.
9178075	9179816	You could do Company President Cat.
9182714	9185522	I don't think we're getting any other calls Grand Empress Kat
9188311	9188551	All right.
9188771	9190213	Loki, do you have any last-minute stories?
9190473	9190633	Yes.
9191794	9199500	So just like they did with the NHL, EA is bringing Madden NFL Arcade to Xbox Live Arcade and PlayStation Network.
9199940	9204885	It will be a five-on-five football game with kind of like a backyard scenario.
9204905	9209048	They say the first of 30, four plays per progression, no penalties, no field goals.
9209748	9212931	And that will be coming for $15 sometime in December.
9212951	9213451	Okay.
9216454	9221878	Also, Nice America wants to bring Holy Invasion of Privacy Badman to UMD.
9222318	9227862	Ironically enough, this game was originally going to come out in UMD, but for whatever reason, it got cock-blocked into download only.
9228423	9234968	But they're looking for a thousand fans to basically promise that they're going to pre-order the game.
9235628	9239131	And if you do that, by November 13th, they will bring out the game.
9240876	9241376	Interesting.
9241636	9241936	Yes.
9242956	9248718	Apparently, third-party publishers are not required to release PSP games on the PlayStation Store.
9249018	9257520	All the more reason that you have the option of buying a UMD game, and that's why you need to own a PSP 3000 and not a Go.
9259780	9261020	You're just limiting your options.
9261280	9269282	Finally, Borderlands, a game that hasn't even come out yet, is already getting its first bit of download content, almost kind of tying in with
9270300	9272642	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
9298072	9299153	Yeah, later this year they say.
9300594	9300954	Interesting.
9326733	9327614	is the rumored date.
9328234	9332077	Also, in related news, I think this was something that was briefly covered on a previous show.
9333838	9342684	The Cleveland fan John Thompson, also known as Big Dog, had recently sued EA because EA used his likeness in Madden NFL.
9342945	9345947	He's one of the super fans that actually dresses up as a dog for the games.
9346407	9350990	Yeah, I can't really explain it either, but I'm assuming if you follow football or live in Cleveland, you know what I'm talking about.
9352211	9353592	He has settled the suit, apparently, $25,000.
9353632	9354012	So, there you go.
9358197	9361059	I'm sorry, the suit has been settled not necessarily for $25,000.
9361439	9365722	That is what he was seeking originally, but we don't know exactly how much it was settled for.
9366083	9366523	So there you go.
9368220	9370141	And that's going to do it for Last Minute Stories tonight.
9370181	9373082	No other calls on Skype line tonight, so I guess that's it.
9373122	9374403	We just have shy callers tonight.
9375003	9378945	So that's going to do it, I guess, for tonight's episode of Orange Launch Radio.
9378965	9381306	Thank you guys so much for tuning in to us and supporting our show.
9381627	9384008	I know it was a crazy-ass show tonight, but you know what?
9384488	9384928	It was fun.
9385088	9385789	It was a lot of fun.
9386609	9392552	But I'm just waiting for the backlash to begin on President Cat, but you're a fool if you don't support it.
9394733	9395994	Let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts.
9396014	9396814	Oh, hey, hey, guess what?
9397259	9398200	Oh god, more?
9398480	9400362	Yeah.

9563557	9567941	There's millions of shows talking about Uncharted 2 this week, and we're certainly not hating on the game by any means.
9567981	9568681	We're just like you.
9570322	9571123	We don't get paid.

9588526	9593128	Honestly, I meant it when I said it earlier, you know, and we're certainly not hating on Uncharted 2 by any means.
9593168	9593748	We're just like you.
9593788	9596389	We have to pay $60 of our own money if we want to play the game.
9596409	9599450	They don't send us this stuff for free, so we'll get to those stuff eventually.
