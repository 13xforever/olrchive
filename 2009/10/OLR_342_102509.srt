1
00:00:14,175 --> 00:00:15,217
[SPEAKER_00]: and I, October 25th, 2009.

2
00:00:15,898 --> 00:00:19,404
[SPEAKER_00]: A major new store burns computer games while you wait.

3
00:00:19,524 --> 00:00:26,737
[SPEAKER_00]: We have an interview about the upcoming charity event, Umlaut, and some crappy little podcast once an obscure Japanese title released in the U.S.

4
00:00:44,443 --> 00:00:52,205
[SPEAKER_08]: I heard any good jokes lately?

5
00:00:53,145 --> 00:00:55,486
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi, and welcome to another edition of Orange Lounge Radio.

6
00:00:57,386 --> 00:01:04,808
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a podcast dedicated to video games, video gaming, gamer lifestyle, and of course, kittens!

7
00:01:05,408 --> 00:01:09,049
[SPEAKER_08]: Cute, adorable, fluffy kittens!

8
00:01:11,345 --> 00:01:20,830
[SPEAKER_08]: My name is Rob Roberts, joining you for the next few hours, of course, as with me as always, say hello to the one and only Secretary of Catnip, DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.

9
00:01:22,711 --> 00:01:27,614
[SPEAKER_08]: And of course, the one and only Secretary of Defense, TechMasterLoki.

10
00:01:28,695 --> 00:01:29,615
[SPEAKER_10]: He cleans the cat box.

11
00:01:30,416 --> 00:01:30,696
[SPEAKER_10]: I do.

12
00:01:32,577 --> 00:01:33,758
[SPEAKER_08]: How are you guys doing tonight?

13
00:01:34,818 --> 00:01:35,879
[SPEAKER_08]: It's been an interesting week.

14
00:01:36,979 --> 00:01:37,960
[SPEAKER_08]: Been a very interesting week.

15
00:01:38,442 --> 00:01:39,703
[SPEAKER_10]: It's been a unique week.

16
00:01:39,783 --> 00:01:41,784
[SPEAKER_08]: It's been a very unique week here at Orange Lounge Radio.

17
00:01:41,824 --> 00:01:46,466
[SPEAKER_08]: I have to say in the seven and a half years we've been doing Orange Lounge Radio, I haven't quite seen anything like it.

18
00:01:47,426 --> 00:01:57,071
[SPEAKER_08]: Usually at Orange Lounge Radio we start off the show talking about our gaming weeks, but you know, in spite of things going on, we thought we might change that up a little bit and start off tonight with some news.

19
00:01:57,651 --> 00:02:02,453
[SPEAKER_08]: And we're going to head over to Joystick with a Q. Of course, we like them over at Joystick.

20
00:02:02,473 --> 00:02:04,234
[SPEAKER_08]: They run lots of fun little game stories.

21
00:02:04,854 --> 00:02:05,715
[SPEAKER_08]: They ran a story this week.

22
00:02:06,095 --> 00:02:08,516
[SPEAKER_08]: Fans campaigning for President Cat.

23
00:02:09,836 --> 00:02:16,479
[SPEAKER_08]: Against all odds, a completely random Japanese Wii game starring a cat blogger has become a hot topic among some fans.

24
00:02:17,239 --> 00:02:24,642
[SPEAKER_08]: Tsukiban Satchu Rena Wii stars a cat named Rena from a popular Japanese blog as the CEO of Cat Queen Inc.

25
00:02:25,042 --> 00:02:29,864
[SPEAKER_08]: You play as a cat going through the initiation into the company, performing various minigames to earn Rena's respect.

26
00:02:29,884 --> 00:02:30,544
[SPEAKER_08]: That's not really true.

27
00:02:31,224 --> 00:02:31,545
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, really?

28
00:02:32,185 --> 00:02:33,545
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't play a cat.

29
00:02:33,565 --> 00:02:34,206
[SPEAKER_03]: You play a person.

30
00:02:34,806 --> 00:02:35,326
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, really now?

31
00:02:37,986 --> 00:02:45,588
[SPEAKER_08]: The Orange Lounge Radio Podcast discovered the game, which they have dubbed President Cat.

32
00:02:46,428 --> 00:02:48,629
[SPEAKER_08]: I like that, that we just dubbed it that.

33
00:02:48,909 --> 00:02:49,609
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, they like it.

34
00:02:49,869 --> 00:02:51,769
[SPEAKER_08]: I shall call it President Cat.

35
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:53,410
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, they like it.

36
00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:53,890
[SPEAKER_08]: They did.

37
00:02:54,530 --> 00:02:56,911
[SPEAKER_08]: Then began tweeting the Wii game's official account.

38
00:02:57,875 --> 00:03:10,485
[SPEAKER_08]: The fans started sending messages of encouragement and support to the President Cat hashtag, and the Rena account has started responding in both Japanese and English, revealing that the publisher is excited and a little confused about all this sudden attention.

39
00:03:11,245 --> 00:03:17,170
[SPEAKER_08]: It would be hilarious if this grassroots movement resulted in the localization of a weird licensed game.

40
00:03:17,890 --> 00:03:21,673
[SPEAKER_08]: However, it would also be pretty sad if the publisher turned out to lose money on it.

41
00:03:22,173 --> 00:03:26,597
[SPEAKER_08]: It's definitely something we want to play, but we're not exactly representative of the mainstream audience.

42
00:03:30,289 --> 00:03:33,190
[SPEAKER_08]: That story coming from JC Fletcher over at Joystick.

43
00:03:33,230 --> 00:03:34,650
[SPEAKER_10]: I want to dodge flying cats.

44
00:03:36,611 --> 00:03:41,972
[SPEAKER_08]: Obviously, we're a little surprised, probably like most people, that this actually made game blogs this week.

45
00:03:42,832 --> 00:03:44,833
[SPEAKER_10]: A number of them.

46
00:03:45,573 --> 00:03:49,014
[SPEAKER_08]: Some people might think it was like a grab for attention, but no, please.

47
00:03:49,074 --> 00:03:52,335
[SPEAKER_08]: We've done far worse desperate cries for attention on this show in the past.

48
00:03:52,375 --> 00:03:52,955
[SPEAKER_08]: This was nothing.

49
00:03:53,375 --> 00:03:55,096
[SPEAKER_08]: What's also interesting about this is that...

50
00:03:56,786 --> 00:03:57,406
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

51
00:04:19,075 --> 00:04:19,976
[SPEAKER_08]: GoNintendo and Destructoid

52
00:04:46,673 --> 00:04:52,015
[SPEAKER_08]: Obviously saw something in it, I think, that wasn't in some of the games we've talked about in the past.

53
00:04:52,595 --> 00:04:53,616
[SPEAKER_08]: And so it's very interesting.

54
00:04:53,876 --> 00:04:56,317
[SPEAKER_08]: It just goes to show the moral of the story.

55
00:04:57,037 --> 00:04:58,698
[SPEAKER_08]: America... Loves cats.

56
00:04:58,838 --> 00:04:59,418
[SPEAKER_08]: Loves cats.

57
00:05:00,699 --> 00:05:05,861
[SPEAKER_08]: And when I say America, I mean collectively the world that listens to this show.

58
00:05:05,901 --> 00:05:12,804
[SPEAKER_08]: We just happen to be in America, but our friends in Australia, Canada, Mexico, Europe, they all fucking love cats too.

59
00:05:13,763 --> 00:05:34,035
[SPEAKER_08]: and I think it just goes to show that people would like to see a game like this not everybody wants to see a game like this of course you look at the comments on this and you know the other sites that ran the article and there's people saying this game looks stupid yeah they probably also like Madden well yeah and my point would be there are some people that look at games like Madden and go well that's stupid

60
00:05:34,315 --> 00:05:34,776
[SPEAKER_10]: Like me.

61
00:05:34,976 --> 00:05:36,658
[SPEAKER_10]: I go a lot stupid to Madden.

62
00:05:36,798 --> 00:05:38,340
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think Madden is stupid.

63
00:05:39,121 --> 00:05:40,242
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not my kind of game.

64
00:05:40,262 --> 00:05:41,283
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it's a waste of my time.

65
00:05:41,423 --> 00:05:44,547
[SPEAKER_08]: But I bet there are people out there that would say Uncharted 2 is stupid.

66
00:05:45,008 --> 00:05:49,473
[SPEAKER_08]: This game that gets critical praise, lavish, left and right upon it.

67
00:05:49,513 --> 00:05:50,474
[SPEAKER_08]: Somebody thinks it's stupid.

68
00:05:50,914 --> 00:05:52,877
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't, but somebody out there probably does.

69
00:05:53,337 --> 00:05:54,338
[SPEAKER_10]: I will say it's stupid.

70
00:05:54,858 --> 00:05:55,739
[SPEAKER_10]: You haven't even played it.

71
00:05:56,059 --> 00:05:56,499
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I haven't.

72
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:57,780
[SPEAKER_08]: You just want to be controversial.

73
00:05:58,101 --> 00:05:58,381
[SPEAKER_08]: I know.

74
00:05:58,421 --> 00:06:01,403
[SPEAKER_08]: See, that's that desperate cry for attention people talk about.

75
00:06:01,643 --> 00:06:02,724
[SPEAKER_09]: It is not.

76
00:06:02,984 --> 00:06:04,545
[SPEAKER_09]: I am unique, just like everyone else.

77
00:06:05,166 --> 00:06:06,567
[SPEAKER_08]: So here's the thing, though.

78
00:06:07,287 --> 00:06:17,015
[SPEAKER_08]: The point behind this, and if you go back on the show weeks and weeks, years and years, months and months, whatever, we've talked about this for a long time.

79
00:06:17,055 --> 00:06:18,796
[SPEAKER_08]: It has to do with risk-taking.

80
00:06:20,669 --> 00:06:22,170
[SPEAKER_08]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

81
00:06:44,725 --> 00:07:04,509
[SPEAKER_08]: and so they didn't really take a big risk I mean sure they I guess took a little risk in putting the game out over here which paid off for them with DDR yeah you know Beatmania not so much but a lot of Japanese companies I think are afraid to take risks sometimes because they think Americans don't get it or we're not gonna get it

82
00:07:05,632 --> 00:07:08,113
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, let this past week be a lesson.

83
00:07:08,673 --> 00:07:11,694
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a lot of people over here that get it.

84
00:07:12,474 --> 00:07:15,135
[SPEAKER_08]: Or else this story would have... Nobody would have cared.

85
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:19,476
[SPEAKER_08]: Just like the past other hundred games we've talked about on this show that should be over here.

86
00:07:19,856 --> 00:07:21,957
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm thinking about doing a Shermie blog as tribute.

87
00:07:24,077 --> 00:07:24,557
[SPEAKER_08]: So, I don't know.

88
00:07:24,617 --> 00:07:26,358
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki, what are your thoughts on this whole thing?

89
00:07:26,378 --> 00:07:28,278
[SPEAKER_08]: You actually got the game this week, right?

90
00:07:28,418 --> 00:07:28,778
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, I did.

91
00:07:29,319 --> 00:07:30,119
[SPEAKER_08]: And what did you think?

92
00:07:30,499 --> 00:07:31,719
[SPEAKER_08]: Is it worth all our hype?

93
00:07:32,359 --> 00:07:34,200
[SPEAKER_08]: Did this get out of hand, what?

94
00:07:35,277 --> 00:07:37,079
[SPEAKER_03]: How much of it is spoken?

95
00:07:58,919 --> 00:07:59,619
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot of it.

96
00:07:59,819 --> 00:08:03,820
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it's not really spoken, it's just kind of in text boxes.

97
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:08,181
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, it's fun.

98
00:08:09,441 --> 00:08:11,281
[SPEAKER_03]: Definitely would pick it up if it came out over here.

99
00:08:11,561 --> 00:08:20,723
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, as I posted in Twitter and stuff, there's been a few other cat games that have come out over here, more like the cat raising systems like, you know, Nintendogs kind of crap.

100
00:08:21,783 --> 00:08:25,964
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, Imagine Cats, and they also have like Purr Pals and stuff like that.

101
00:08:26,104 --> 00:08:28,044
[SPEAKER_03]: And you have to understand, even though

102
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:32,181
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of people don't get these kind of games on the Wii.

103
00:08:33,222 --> 00:08:35,824
[SPEAKER_03]: The Wii has so many units out there, it doesn't matter.

104
00:08:35,844 --> 00:08:41,127
[SPEAKER_03]: It takes such a small percentage of the people out there to sell a lot of units of this.

105
00:08:41,167 --> 00:08:42,628
[SPEAKER_03]: For example, those other cat games.

106
00:08:43,229 --> 00:08:45,630
[SPEAKER_03]: 200,000 units and 400,000 units.

107
00:08:46,091 --> 00:08:47,051
[SPEAKER_03]: And they were shit.

108
00:08:47,512 --> 00:08:48,993
[SPEAKER_03]: They were absolute shit.

109
00:08:49,333 --> 00:08:52,375
[SPEAKER_03]: But people will buy anything that comes out on the Wii.

110
00:08:52,795 --> 00:08:55,237
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you put President Cat on the front of that box...

111
00:08:56,081 --> 00:08:56,381
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura.com

112
00:09:15,911 --> 00:09:19,472
[SPEAKER_08]: What is the fear of putting a game like this out in the US?

113
00:09:36,997 --> 00:09:37,957
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, there's plenty.

114
00:09:38,017 --> 00:09:41,378
[SPEAKER_08]: We read off Japanese releases every week, and many of them don't come over here.

115
00:09:42,278 --> 00:09:44,579
[SPEAKER_08]: Do they just think we don't get it?

116
00:09:45,019 --> 00:09:46,959
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just not the kind of game that would do well here?

117
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:48,319
[SPEAKER_08]: What is the fear?

118
00:09:48,539 --> 00:09:57,541
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that it's just a lot of money that goes into localizing the game, and if they don't feel that they're going to sell enough units, then they're just not going to bother with it.

119
00:09:57,901 --> 00:10:05,383
[SPEAKER_03]: But then I look at companies like Atlus or even Axis Game Localization or even Ignition, whatever.

120
00:10:06,012 --> 00:10:09,226
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of their games that come out over here that they decided to put out on the Wii...

121
00:10:10,228 --> 00:10:12,710
[SPEAKER_03]: or even like the DS and stuff don't sell that many units.

122
00:10:12,930 --> 00:10:18,594
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, Atlus especially, they don't sell a lot of units, maybe 200,000 on a good title.

123
00:10:19,454 --> 00:10:21,636
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, they only have a limited run.

124
00:10:21,676 --> 00:10:23,137
[SPEAKER_03]: They've really cut their budget that way.

125
00:10:23,697 --> 00:10:32,283
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think that something like this, given the right marketing behind it, and I'm sure there would be, you know, a lot of praise for it, I think it would do pretty well.

126
00:10:32,643 --> 00:10:38,667
[SPEAKER_03]: And when you consider like these games like Pets, Cats 2 and Purr Pals, they have no marketing.

127
00:10:38,847 --> 00:10:40,068
[SPEAKER_03]: They have zero marketing.

128
00:10:40,768 --> 00:10:41,709
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

129
00:11:00,799 --> 00:11:05,360
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's go to the chat room, our always present other guests here on the program, chat.orangehauntsradio.com.

130
00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:09,301
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkTetsuya in chat asks, yeah, who would we contact about localizing this, if anyone?

131
00:11:09,321 --> 00:11:15,682
[SPEAKER_08]: And this kind of, you know, leading into the next question, what happens from here with our little mission to get this game localized?

132
00:11:15,762 --> 00:11:16,783
[SPEAKER_08]: I have a thought, but go ahead.

133
00:11:17,383 --> 00:11:22,644
[SPEAKER_03]: I would contact kind of the usual bunch of people that are out there playing.

134
00:11:23,348 --> 00:11:24,689
[SPEAKER_03]: Localizing Weird-Ass Games

135
00:11:48,226 --> 00:11:54,269
[SPEAKER_03]: But I guess they're picking these properties cheap enough or something that they decide, you know, that it's worth putting it out.

136
00:11:54,309 --> 00:12:00,291
[SPEAKER_03]: Like they put out, I forget if it was like Go Minion or something like that.

137
00:12:00,311 --> 00:12:03,113
[SPEAKER_03]: It ended up coming out as Domino Rally over here or something like that.

138
00:12:03,133 --> 00:12:05,113
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like Go Go Minion, I think was the name of it.

139
00:12:05,133 --> 00:12:09,595
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, that's a really obscure title, but they went ahead and brought it over here.

140
00:12:09,716 --> 00:12:11,756
[SPEAKER_03]: Axis Game Localization does the same stuff.

141
00:12:12,237 --> 00:12:14,338
[SPEAKER_03]: They've been doing a little bit more mainstream stuff lately.

142
00:12:14,378 --> 00:12:17,019
[SPEAKER_03]: They've been doing the Guilty Gear series, a lot of stuff from that.

143
00:12:17,938 --> 00:12:19,439
[SPEAKER_03]: But there's a few other things that they bring over.

144
00:12:19,859 --> 00:12:26,601
[SPEAKER_03]: Then if you want to talk to other publishers, there's Zoo Games that brings out a lot of, like, kind of bargain bin stuff.

145
00:12:26,641 --> 00:12:30,683
[SPEAKER_03]: They do a lot of localization for UK games that get released over there.

146
00:12:30,703 --> 00:12:40,547
[SPEAKER_03]: But they're willing to bring over properties that no one has any idea what the hell they are over here, like Kokuto, which is some sort of demon character that's popular, I guess, in the UK or something.

147
00:12:40,987 --> 00:12:44,568
[SPEAKER_08]: So should our listeners that feel passionate about the game email these guys, tweet them?

148
00:12:44,648 --> 00:12:46,349
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I think it'd be a good idea to maybe...

149
00:12:47,503 --> 00:13:11,446
[SPEAKER_03]: I would bring it up to maybe, I would go with like UFO Interactive and maybe Triaxis, maybe even like D3 or something, because remember D3, they brought over Defense Force, which is sweet and weird, Onishambara, plus they have the Simple Series in Japan, so they're used to weird ass games, but it's just, I don't know, it couldn't hurt to hit up more people than less.

150
00:13:12,571 --> 00:13:13,652
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks for watching!

151
00:13:32,034 --> 00:13:32,795
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

152
00:13:49,754 --> 00:14:01,008
[SPEAKER_08]: If you don't think game developers have already noticed when several major, major gaming blogs picked up the story... Yeah, and really what it comes down to is what kind of units are they looking to sell?

153
00:14:01,108 --> 00:14:03,051
[SPEAKER_03]: What would make it worthwhile for them to bring it over here?

154
00:14:03,091 --> 00:14:05,474
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, obviously something like this is not going to sell a million units.

155
00:14:05,594 --> 00:14:08,377
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's not going to be... I don't think it's going to be the next Katamari.

156
00:14:08,597 --> 00:14:08,998
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not...

157
00:14:09,830 --> 00:14:10,330
[SPEAKER_10]: They didn't need it.

158
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:12,092
[SPEAKER_10]: Katamari was going to be the next Katamari.

159
00:14:12,292 --> 00:14:13,673
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually, it's good you bring that up.

160
00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:16,415
[SPEAKER_08]: Keep in mind, Katamari Damacy was a big risk, too.

161
00:14:16,695 --> 00:14:19,537
[SPEAKER_08]: That game was released for $20 several years ago.

162
00:14:19,577 --> 00:14:23,079
[SPEAKER_10]: And it was weird, and everyone loved it because it was different.

163
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:33,446
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to read this comment, and I don't know if you have anything else you want to say on this, DarkSakura, but another comment from chat, Bochikawa in chat, Sky, the best jokes are those that we all can relate to.

164
00:14:34,087 --> 00:14:36,208
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think you hit the nail on the head there.

165
00:14:36,388 --> 00:14:36,749
[SPEAKER_08]: Again,

166
00:14:37,952 --> 00:14:38,613
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

167
00:14:57,083 --> 00:14:59,164
[SPEAKER_08]: and it's part the Twitter thing.

168
00:14:59,504 --> 00:15:00,745
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that speaks volumes about Twitter.

169
00:15:01,105 --> 00:15:02,026
[SPEAKER_08]: It's part the Twitter thing.

170
00:15:02,346 --> 00:15:06,268
[SPEAKER_08]: But I think it's part the fact that people looked at this and went, oh my God, this does look really cute.

171
00:15:08,249 --> 00:15:22,776
[SPEAKER_08]: Why isn't there like a lolcats game with this as big as, you know, and maybe that wasn't the point behind this game, but that's what a lot of us are kind of interpreting it as, is cats in funny situations, cat wearing cat masks and the whole like stealing money game I saw a video of with the cats and the cat driving the car.

172
00:15:23,036 --> 00:15:26,338
[SPEAKER_08]: It is ridiculous and preposterous like lolcats and fun.

173
00:15:27,438 --> 00:15:27,819
[SPEAKER_08]: Fun.

174
00:15:28,721 --> 00:15:29,042
[SPEAKER_08]: Fun.

175
00:15:29,062 --> 00:15:33,734
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that the best kind of fun is the ones you don't expect to be fun.

176
00:15:34,075 --> 00:15:34,937
[SPEAKER_10]: The ones that surprise you.

177
00:15:35,572 --> 00:15:36,272
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

178
00:16:01,224 --> 00:16:03,405
[SPEAKER_08]: I gotta read this comment from Actdeft in our chatroom.

179
00:16:03,505 --> 00:16:05,267
[SPEAKER_08]: And who says that Twitter is useless?

180
00:16:05,767 --> 00:16:06,848
[SPEAKER_08]: I did two weeks ago.

181
00:16:07,348 --> 00:16:14,093
[SPEAKER_08]: I was actually listening to the show before last week's show, and I had said I was done and fed up with Twitter and I didn't get the point.

182
00:16:14,553 --> 00:16:15,694
[SPEAKER_08]: Boy, did I get told.

183
00:16:16,774 --> 00:16:17,355
[SPEAKER_08]: What did I get shown?

184
00:16:17,375 --> 00:16:17,975
[SPEAKER_10]: What is our purpose?

185
00:16:35,379 --> 00:16:36,940
[SPEAKER_10]: Whatever we determined it is at the time.

186
00:16:37,821 --> 00:16:45,405
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I think our purpose was to show that more Japanese developers should think about bringing their quirky little games over here because there's an audience for it.

187
00:16:45,666 --> 00:16:48,067
[SPEAKER_10]: Shoot, where was it that we would always go to at E3?

188
00:16:48,107 --> 00:16:53,250
[SPEAKER_10]: We would go to the small little developers, to the ones that were looking... Kensha frickin' Hall.

189
00:16:53,851 --> 00:16:59,634
[SPEAKER_10]: Or the back corner where Natsume had their little walk around thinking you could get... Look, my sheep is right over there.

190
00:16:59,694 --> 00:17:00,955
[SPEAKER_10]: My Harvest Moon sheep.

191
00:17:01,796 --> 00:17:02,036
[SPEAKER_10]: You know...

192
00:17:04,077 --> 00:17:17,003
[SPEAKER_10]: Also, I was thinking, Matt made some good suggestions, but I think also look for that company, see if they've released any other games that have been released in the U.S.

193
00:17:17,043 --> 00:17:18,964
[SPEAKER_10]: and see who their marketer was.

194
00:17:20,585 --> 00:17:26,728
[SPEAKER_08]: But certainly, though, after the antics of last week, you know in a boardroom somewhere in Japan this got brought up.

195
00:17:27,367 --> 00:17:28,408
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

196
00:17:49,076 --> 00:17:49,857
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

197
00:18:00,956 --> 00:18:05,699
[SPEAKER_08]: So that was pretty much... So maybe developers, when you localize this, a little less Bing?

198
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:08,221
[SPEAKER_08]: How about a cute meow noise instead of a Bing?

199
00:18:08,261 --> 00:18:12,624
[SPEAKER_10]: Something I actually noticed from the screenshots is that it's actually in very simple Japanese.

200
00:18:14,165 --> 00:18:20,810
[SPEAKER_09]: But part of the reason I was wondering is how much of it was actually spoken dialogue is because it would be much easier to follow if it's spoken.

201
00:18:20,830 --> 00:18:21,911
[SPEAKER_03]: There wasn't really any spoken.

202
00:18:21,991 --> 00:18:24,173
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a lot of meows and lots of text boxes.

203
00:18:24,977 --> 00:18:26,659
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

204
00:18:43,434 --> 00:18:45,435
[SPEAKER_08]: I will render services.

205
00:18:45,595 --> 00:18:47,435
[SPEAKER_08]: Any other thoughts on President Cat for now?

206
00:18:47,755 --> 00:18:49,476
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know if there's anything left to say.

207
00:18:49,776 --> 00:18:52,376
[SPEAKER_08]: In a way, I kind of think our mission was successful.

208
00:18:52,496 --> 00:18:54,557
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know if there's a lot else that can be done.

209
00:18:55,077 --> 00:18:59,038
[SPEAKER_08]: Ultimately, it's out of our hands at this point, and it is who's going to take a risk.

210
00:18:59,158 --> 00:19:00,358
[SPEAKER_10]: We can keep the awareness up.

211
00:19:00,638 --> 00:19:04,319
[SPEAKER_08]: I think we can keep the awareness up, and we can alert the potential risk takers.

212
00:19:04,499 --> 00:19:05,579
[SPEAKER_10]: Keep that hashtag going.

213
00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:06,940
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, keep the hashtag going.

214
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:11,241
[SPEAKER_08]: Tweet the companies that you think ought to bring it over, and who knows what may happen.

215
00:19:12,356 --> 00:19:22,861
[SPEAKER_08]: Especially those of you that felt the need to email, because I know this came from tips from listeners, these various game blogs around the story.

216
00:19:23,621 --> 00:19:29,104
[SPEAKER_08]: Now that we've got that, I guess, start emailing some of the developers and see what happens.

217
00:19:29,324 --> 00:19:31,045
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, the worst that happens, they're going to delete it.

218
00:19:31,733 --> 00:19:35,395
[SPEAKER_09]: Actually, I got their email address, the people over there.

219
00:19:36,435 --> 00:19:59,067
[SPEAKER_10]: I've just been trying to get a hold of one of my friends in Japan to translate it for me, and she's been less than forthcoming because she has, a mutual friend is over there visiting, so I might see if, any of our Japanese listeners who's really good with your translation, let me know, because I wanted to let them know exactly how we came across them, so shoot an email at the mailbag.

220
00:19:59,787 --> 00:20:00,047
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

221
00:20:00,567 --> 00:20:02,028
[SPEAKER_10]: And we'll work together.

222
00:20:02,648 --> 00:20:06,770
[SPEAKER_10]: There may be some lucrative opportunity for you.

223
00:20:07,391 --> 00:20:07,651
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

224
00:20:08,151 --> 00:20:10,712
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, let's get back into our regular show here.

225
00:20:10,752 --> 00:20:18,296
[SPEAKER_08]: Obviously, we've taken a 20-minute detour to talk about President Cap, but that kind of thing happens when we tend to get spotlighted for a week for whatever reason.

226
00:20:18,316 --> 00:20:20,437
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to move into our regular show now.

227
00:20:20,637 --> 00:20:22,578
[SPEAKER_10]: Our ego swell and we turn into big divas.

228
00:20:23,078 --> 00:20:23,578
[SPEAKER_08]: Basically.

229
00:20:24,679 --> 00:20:25,399
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, wait a minute.

230
00:20:25,419 --> 00:20:25,759
[SPEAKER_08]: What is this?

231
00:20:25,819 --> 00:20:26,880
[SPEAKER_08]: I asked for a Diet Coke.

232
00:20:27,762 --> 00:20:32,488
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

233
00:20:45,706 --> 00:20:47,047
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

234
00:21:05,979 --> 00:21:07,821
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, how have you had your gaming week?

235
00:21:07,841 --> 00:21:08,082
[SPEAKER_08]: Peggle!

236
00:21:27,975 --> 00:21:29,356
[SPEAKER_10]: Lots and lots of Peggle.

237
00:21:30,016 --> 00:21:34,258
[SPEAKER_10]: My goal in Peggle has been to beat some of the levels on the first try.

238
00:21:34,638 --> 00:21:38,260
[SPEAKER_10]: And I beat that freaking hard DNA level on the first try, and I was very proud of myself.

239
00:21:39,241 --> 00:21:41,202
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, one of the last ones with the spirals going up.

240
00:21:41,422 --> 00:21:41,622
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyway.

241
00:21:42,342 --> 00:21:53,608
[SPEAKER_10]: I have also really not been playing much of anything else, just simply because I had my midterms last week, and migraines all last week, and just...

242
00:21:54,828 --> 00:21:58,492
[SPEAKER_10]: The Son of Crap All Week Loki, how was your gaming week?

243
00:22:14,741 --> 00:22:15,502
[SPEAKER_03]: It was pretty good.

244
00:22:15,662 --> 00:22:18,603
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually played, well, like I mentioned earlier, President Cat.

245
00:22:18,903 --> 00:22:21,684
[SPEAKER_03]: So I played a little bit of the new Rena game.

246
00:22:22,425 --> 00:22:23,965
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was fun.

247
00:22:24,465 --> 00:22:31,228
[SPEAKER_03]: I got through... It starts off, it kind of breaks it up, like there's three mini-games you have to do, and then three more after that.

248
00:22:31,749 --> 00:22:37,011
[SPEAKER_03]: And I got past the first three mini-games, which is tough, because the last one was some question-answer thing.

249
00:22:38,345 --> 00:22:42,667
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't read any of that, so I just kept hitting random buttons, and yet somehow I was getting it correct.

250
00:22:43,227 --> 00:22:44,508
[SPEAKER_03]: So I managed to get past that.

251
00:22:44,548 --> 00:22:52,451
[SPEAKER_03]: I played the piano portion, which, even though I was hitting it in time, I guess I wasn't doing it well enough, and so they're getting pissed off.

252
00:22:53,211 --> 00:23:05,136
[SPEAKER_03]: And, of course, the car driving, which is weird, because you're controlling the cat in the back of the car that's sucking up what look like stars or clouds or something.

253
00:23:05,156 --> 00:23:06,196
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just weird.

254
00:23:06,897 --> 00:23:06,997
[SPEAKER_03]: Um...

255
00:23:08,072 --> 00:23:26,362
[SPEAKER_03]: and then also play the cat dodging which was kind of fun but yeah the game is weird and fun so definitely worth checking out the other thing of course I played tons of was DJ Hero just knocked out most of the songs in the game I think I've actually played through everything now

256
00:23:29,116 --> 00:23:29,937
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

257
00:23:48,076 --> 00:23:52,858
[SPEAKER_03]: and then finally of course Grand Theft Auto 4 played some more Lost and Damned.

258
00:23:53,278 --> 00:24:12,326
[SPEAKER_03]: Also found a way around their patch to get rid of the mods but I haven't really done much with that because it's not working correct because apparently if you've ever modded the Grand Theft Auto on PC if you change too much it becomes unstable and then each save file actually saves some of the

259
00:24:14,113 --> 00:24:14,954
[SPEAKER_03]: Stuff that you change.

260
00:24:14,994 --> 00:24:20,798
[SPEAKER_03]: So if I try to change certain weapons or whatever, they'll kind of disappear from the save, and it's a pain in the ass.

261
00:24:21,378 --> 00:24:28,263
[SPEAKER_03]: So I found a way around all that, but unfortunately the modded disc I made was very unstable, so I have to go back to the drawing board.

262
00:24:28,623 --> 00:24:41,412
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't really care, though, because a new expansion's coming out at the end of next week, so I may just hold off on modding everything until I can maybe get my hands on the Episodes of Liberty City disc instead, because that might be a little more fun.

263
00:24:42,273 --> 00:24:47,414
[SPEAKER_03]: We were even just playing the new expansion because that's just going to be all sorts of awesome.

264
00:24:48,674 --> 00:24:55,336
[SPEAKER_03]: Other than that, I moved the arcade cabinet into the house this afternoon, so hopefully going to be done with that soon.

265
00:24:55,356 --> 00:25:01,497
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm downloading some front-end stuff for this program called Hyper Spin.

266
00:25:01,537 --> 00:25:03,377
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to be running on it.

267
00:25:03,557 --> 00:25:07,698
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been downloading themes for a bunch of different games that I have in MAME.

268
00:25:07,718 --> 00:25:09,079
[SPEAKER_03]: That's it.

269
00:25:12,523 --> 00:25:19,388
[SPEAKER_08]: I've been playing mostly World of Warcraft this week because, you know, I'm sucked into WoWcrack, but I did try out one new game.

270
00:25:20,109 --> 00:25:30,277
[SPEAKER_08]: I say game in quotes because it wasn't really a game, but I checked out a game on PlayStation Network this week called Dot Detuned, or just Detuned, I guess you could call the game.

271
00:25:30,637 --> 00:25:33,459
[SPEAKER_08]: And it was something I think that was brought up at the very end of our show last week.

272
00:25:33,479 --> 00:25:35,301
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to say one of the callers alerted us to it or

273
00:25:35,921 --> 00:25:41,323
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know if I saw it on Twitter during the week, but I saw it was $3, and I was like, wow, what a deal for a game.

274
00:25:41,383 --> 00:25:46,426
[SPEAKER_08]: So I went ahead and downloaded it and checked it out, and yeah, it wasn't quite what I was expecting.

275
00:25:46,486 --> 00:25:54,469
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I heard that you could use custom soundtracks in the game, and I finally figured out why my songs weren't copying over on my USB card to the PS3.

276
00:25:54,589 --> 00:25:59,151
[SPEAKER_08]: I had to go in there and do all or whatever, hit the triangle button, and was finally able to figure it out.

277
00:25:59,691 --> 00:26:00,191
[SPEAKER_08]: I love music games.

278
00:26:00,211 --> 00:26:00,812
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what I'm all about.

279
00:26:00,832 --> 00:26:01,612
[SPEAKER_08]: So let's check out this game.

280
00:26:01,632 --> 00:26:02,172
[SPEAKER_08]: Not exactly.

281
00:26:17,239 --> 00:26:18,299
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

282
00:26:40,129 --> 00:26:40,850
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

283
00:26:56,127 --> 00:26:57,408
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

284
00:27:26,249 --> 00:27:27,530
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

285
00:27:47,909 --> 00:27:50,871
[SPEAKER_08]: You sit there and you press the buttons and it kind of does different things.

286
00:27:51,312 --> 00:27:54,614
[SPEAKER_08]: I imagine it's a lot more impactful if you're on drugs or something.

287
00:27:55,154 --> 00:27:57,556
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not on drugs, so I didn't quite see that.

288
00:27:57,956 --> 00:28:01,258
[SPEAKER_08]: But yeah, it was just interesting.

289
00:28:01,859 --> 00:28:07,202
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not saying it was bad because it was $3 and it's certainly something different.

290
00:28:07,242 --> 00:28:10,284
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just saying it's not a game, so be careful.

291
00:28:10,344 --> 00:28:13,386
[SPEAKER_08]: And yet it awards trophies even though it's not a game.

292
00:28:13,666 --> 00:28:16,989
[SPEAKER_08]: And I will tell you this, if you want the easiest trophies,

293
00:28:17,629 --> 00:28:20,750
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, easier than those achievements in the Avatar game on 360.

294
00:28:22,171 --> 00:28:28,033
[SPEAKER_08]: Just pay the three bucks for this game and you can have like a gold trophy, like three silvers and a handful of bronze in like seconds.

295
00:28:29,073 --> 00:28:35,416
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't even look at what the trophies were and I had all but one of them unlocked in five minutes in the game.

296
00:28:35,456 --> 00:28:36,956
[SPEAKER_08]: It was incredibly simple.

297
00:28:37,737 --> 00:28:45,079
[SPEAKER_08]: But that's, of course, I wouldn't recommend downloading a game just for trophies, but I know there's some people out there that are, you know, EPing whores and want to see that stuff.

298
00:28:45,820 --> 00:28:46,380
[SPEAKER_08]: Otherwise,

299
00:28:47,745 --> 00:28:55,688
[SPEAKER_08]: This is kind of one of those things, like, I don't know if you ever go to, like, the Museum of Modern Art, and you see some things in there that are really, really cool, like Andy Warhol paintings, you're like, oh, that's kind of neat.

300
00:28:55,708 --> 00:28:57,429
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, that Marilyn Monroe painting's kind of rad.

301
00:28:57,949 --> 00:29:05,112
[SPEAKER_08]: But then, like, you see that other piece on the wall that just looks like someone threw a paint can against the canvas and called it art.

302
00:29:05,372 --> 00:29:05,932
[SPEAKER_08]: That's art!

303
00:29:06,592 --> 00:29:11,094
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, this is, okay, well, this is what that game, this is the art equivalent of...

304
00:29:12,253 --> 00:29:14,375
[SPEAKER_08]: This is the video game equivalent of that art piece.

305
00:29:14,835 --> 00:29:19,538
[SPEAKER_08]: You kind of look at it and go, okay, I guess there's art in here somewhere.

306
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:27,303
[SPEAKER_08]: But you know what, it does add to the very interesting debate that is, are video games art or not?

307
00:29:27,963 --> 00:29:29,945
[SPEAKER_08]: It's very, very strange.

308
00:29:30,405 --> 00:29:30,925
[SPEAKER_08]: So there you go.

309
00:29:32,386 --> 00:29:34,007
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm going to link this in the chat room.

310
00:29:34,408 --> 00:29:35,028
[SPEAKER_10]: But look at this.

311
00:29:35,929 --> 00:29:36,469
[SPEAKER_10]: Isn't that art?

312
00:29:36,769 --> 00:29:37,830
[SPEAKER_08]: I've seen that before.

313
00:29:38,871 --> 00:29:40,672
[SPEAKER_10]: But it's not what one would conventionally...

314
00:29:41,963 --> 00:29:43,244
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

315
00:30:03,052 --> 00:30:03,532
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

316
00:30:24,011 --> 00:30:24,271
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

317
00:30:44,557 --> 00:30:47,338
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, so that's not the most bizarre thing ever.

318
00:30:47,838 --> 00:30:50,479
[SPEAKER_08]: Going to the chat room, Alpha Cananogram is in caps.

319
00:30:50,659 --> 00:30:51,599
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not a game.

320
00:30:52,060 --> 00:30:52,880
[SPEAKER_08]: I believe I said that.

321
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:53,860
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not a game.

322
00:30:54,340 --> 00:30:57,962
[SPEAKER_08]: But keep in mind, they're selling it in the game section of the PlayStation Store.

323
00:30:58,062 --> 00:31:00,042
[SPEAKER_08]: So just, you know, be forewarned.

324
00:31:00,102 --> 00:31:01,623
[SPEAKER_08]: It is not a game.

325
00:31:01,663 --> 00:31:04,024
[SPEAKER_08]: And it awards trophies like a game would do.

326
00:31:05,504 --> 00:31:08,665
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, games usually have objectives and there are objectives with the trophy.

327
00:31:08,685 --> 00:31:09,405
[SPEAKER_08]: But it's not a game.

328
00:31:09,445 --> 00:31:10,006
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just saying.

329
00:31:10,446 --> 00:31:11,006
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not a game.

330
00:31:12,847 --> 00:31:13,327
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura.com

331
00:31:38,610 --> 00:31:41,472
[SPEAKER_08]: at www.twitter.com slash OLR.

332
00:31:42,072 --> 00:31:44,874
[SPEAKER_08]: And also on tonight's show, we actually have a pretty full show tonight.

333
00:31:45,134 --> 00:31:49,076
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to be interviewing later on in the show, in part B, our pal Seg.

334
00:31:49,497 --> 00:31:54,780
[SPEAKER_08]: He is putting on a big part of this Oom Loud event that's going on in San Francisco.

335
00:31:54,820 --> 00:31:56,521
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a charity event for Child's Play.

336
00:31:57,121 --> 00:32:02,304
[SPEAKER_08]: And we think these kinds of things that are very creative and involve video games and, you know, raise money for good causes.

337
00:32:02,645 --> 00:32:05,827
[SPEAKER_08]: Things that give gamers a good name as opposed to, you know,

338
00:32:06,587 --> 00:32:10,309
[SPEAKER_08]: Kid shoots up neighbors, says he was inspired by Grand Theft Auto.

339
00:32:10,669 --> 00:32:15,211
[SPEAKER_08]: We love covering things like this that really offset the crap stuff that's in the media.

340
00:32:15,251 --> 00:32:16,311
[SPEAKER_08]: So this is a great cause.

341
00:32:16,692 --> 00:32:18,813
[SPEAKER_08]: We hope our friends in the Bay Area will show up to this.

342
00:32:18,853 --> 00:32:21,154
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to talk to Seg a little later in the show, talk about Umlaut.

343
00:32:21,474 --> 00:32:22,234
[SPEAKER_08]: I know I'm going.

344
00:32:22,594 --> 00:32:24,395
[SPEAKER_08]: I think Jamie's going to go because I'll give her a ride.

345
00:32:24,415 --> 00:32:25,536
[SPEAKER_08]: She said all she needed was a ride.

346
00:32:25,876 --> 00:32:27,196
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki will try to get to go.

347
00:32:27,717 --> 00:32:30,338
[SPEAKER_08]: If all of us can go, we could have a band.

348
00:32:31,857 --> 00:32:33,640
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

349
00:32:41,607 --> 00:32:43,729
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyhow, we'll get into that a little later on in Part B of our show.

350
00:32:44,089 --> 00:32:45,690
[SPEAKER_08]: But first, some gaming news.

351
00:32:45,910 --> 00:32:46,971
[SPEAKER_03]: Start us off tonight, Loki.

352
00:32:47,451 --> 00:32:52,294
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, recently Microsoft opened their first Microsoft store in Scottsdale, Arizona.

353
00:32:53,015 --> 00:33:05,824
[SPEAKER_03]: And of course, one of the big things about the store, other than kind of being sort of a copy of an Apple store, is that they have the ability to basically print their own Windows games.

354
00:33:06,544 --> 00:33:09,607
[SPEAKER_03]: And the way this is done is you actually order it from a kiosk.

355
00:33:10,527 --> 00:33:27,872
[SPEAKER_03]: and then give your name to one of the representatives in the stores and then basically wait a few minutes and you'll actually have the game with the label on the game printed, the case and inserts as well as the manual all printed for you.

356
00:33:28,532 --> 00:33:29,733
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's kind of like that whole...

357
00:33:32,165 --> 00:33:39,610
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, they have a kiosk out there that will print, or I guess will make custom DVDs for you as well, like movies.

358
00:33:40,091 --> 00:33:54,120
[SPEAKER_03]: But this is kind of cool, actually, because you can't really knock it since games, like for PC at least, there's not really a used market for them, at least not one that you would see in a GameStop or something like that.

359
00:33:54,701 --> 00:33:58,263
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you're looking for a case and stuff, and...

360
00:33:59,224 --> 00:34:01,005
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't have to have inventory in the store.

361
00:34:01,045 --> 00:34:05,248
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, that's pretty awesome.

362
00:34:05,528 --> 00:34:09,431
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd be kind of curious to see if they could do something like this with Xbox Live Arcade games or something.

363
00:34:09,451 --> 00:34:10,172
[SPEAKER_03]: That'd be pretty cool.

364
00:34:11,602 --> 00:34:12,103
[SPEAKER_08]: Red Boss Kiosks

365
00:34:31,445 --> 00:34:32,065
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

366
00:34:48,911 --> 00:34:49,372
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

367
00:35:04,674 --> 00:35:26,901
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess I get the idea of putting out-of-print or catalog games into this kind of system, but as far as new games go, isn't the whole reason to walk into a store and buy a video game as opposed to just going onto Steam or Direct to Drive or one of those companies online, isn't the whole point of having the box, having the manual and that kind of new game smell that comes when you open up the box?

368
00:35:27,141 --> 00:35:28,021
[SPEAKER_03]: They still get that.

369
00:35:28,041 --> 00:35:29,782
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, they get the manual and everything printed.

370
00:35:30,002 --> 00:35:33,383
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just they won't get the big, giant cardboard box that goes with it.

371
00:35:34,303 --> 00:35:35,745
[SPEAKER_03]: Which I guess saves trees.

372
00:35:35,865 --> 00:35:36,625
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

373
00:35:37,006 --> 00:35:38,327
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess you could look at it that way.

374
00:35:38,527 --> 00:35:41,989
[SPEAKER_03]: It's neat, I guess.

375
00:35:43,010 --> 00:35:48,655
[SPEAKER_03]: You get a disc and you don't have to worry about it being out of stock because they're just burning the game for you.

376
00:35:48,735 --> 00:35:49,876
[SPEAKER_03]: So, why not?

377
00:35:50,703 --> 00:35:51,223
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

378
00:36:08,737 --> 00:36:14,260
[SPEAKER_08]: But I guess this might be cool for like parents going Christmas shopping, wanting to buy computer games for the kids.

379
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:20,143
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, you could see what the game looks like on a monitor in front of you, kind of see if it's appropriate for kids or not.

380
00:36:20,463 --> 00:36:28,167
[SPEAKER_08]: Like if it's, you know, Lego that you're getting or if it's, you know, Demon Slayers from hell with boobies or whatever that, you know, you don't want to get the kids.

381
00:36:28,187 --> 00:36:33,029
[SPEAKER_08]: You can kind of see what it is in the kiosk before you actually buy it and then have it printed right there.

382
00:36:33,269 --> 00:36:35,711
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess that would be the target audience for this kind of thing.

383
00:36:36,271 --> 00:36:36,671
[SPEAKER_08]: I think so.

384
00:36:36,731 --> 00:36:37,231
[SPEAKER_08]: Question mark.

385
00:36:37,672 --> 00:36:37,852
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

386
00:36:38,312 --> 00:36:38,432
[SPEAKER_08]: So.

387
00:36:41,238 --> 00:36:48,743
[SPEAKER_08]: and some comments from our chatroom at chat.orangeloungeradio.com GameGuru says, besides, you can buy DVD cases and print out box art.

388
00:36:49,184 --> 00:36:49,804
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, but I don't know.

389
00:36:49,844 --> 00:36:50,484
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not the same.

390
00:36:51,085 --> 00:36:53,246
[SPEAKER_08]: The homemade stuff just isn't the same to me.

391
00:36:53,366 --> 00:36:58,570
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not the same and they actually, obviously, since it's games for Windows stuff, they have this stuff licensed.

392
00:36:58,590 --> 00:37:02,192
[SPEAKER_03]: They have the actual manufacturers giving them the artwork for this.

393
00:37:02,252 --> 00:37:09,937
[SPEAKER_03]: They have probably the process to I'm sure it's not just going to be like an inkjet printer printing out a piece of crappy artwork that's going to be on

394
00:37:10,137 --> 00:37:13,619
[SPEAKER_03]: Paper that looks like cheap crap that you would make at home.

395
00:37:14,079 --> 00:37:17,221
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think this is going to be a little bit better than that.

396
00:37:18,041 --> 00:37:20,383
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't know.

397
00:37:21,083 --> 00:37:21,823
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd be interested to see.

398
00:37:21,863 --> 00:37:23,404
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot of people that reported on this.

399
00:37:23,904 --> 00:37:26,966
[SPEAKER_03]: And obviously a lot of people that visited the store.

400
00:37:27,426 --> 00:37:31,709
[SPEAKER_03]: So how is the software that's burned off that?

401
00:37:31,729 --> 00:37:32,389
[SPEAKER_03]: Does it look good?

402
00:37:32,449 --> 00:37:34,710
[SPEAKER_03]: Does it look cheap and knocked off?

403
00:37:35,411 --> 00:37:37,552
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it something that you could probably do at home for a lot less?

404
00:37:37,572 --> 00:37:37,772
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

405
00:37:39,543 --> 00:37:40,704
[SPEAKER_08]: Everything Working Designs Did

406
00:38:00,034 --> 00:38:02,577
[SPEAKER_08]: I would like to see them in their store

407
00:38:15,414 --> 00:38:17,596
[SPEAKER_03]: I would like to see this in other stores.

408
00:38:18,417 --> 00:38:28,686
[SPEAKER_03]: I know you can buy Microsoft Points and stuff like that and go purchase your own Xbox Live Arcade games, but I want actual cards for each individual game.

409
00:38:29,207 --> 00:38:41,398
[SPEAKER_03]: Or something that I can print out and say, I want to give the gift of, and why I would never punish someone like this, give someone the gift of the Warriors game that they put out on Xbox Live Arcade.

410
00:38:41,892 --> 00:38:42,773
[SPEAKER_03]: and so on and so forth.

411
00:39:05,635 --> 00:39:11,920
[SPEAKER_08]: So, okay, Jamie brought in an epic manual that came to her mind, and it's for Sega Ages on the Sega Saturn, and it's fancy.

412
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:15,843
[SPEAKER_08]: It's got, like, raised print and, like, the foil writing for Sega Ages.

413
00:39:16,363 --> 00:39:17,424
[SPEAKER_08]: It was a working designs game.

414
00:39:18,045 --> 00:39:18,645
[SPEAKER_08]: It's pretty epic.

415
00:39:19,886 --> 00:39:20,367
[SPEAKER_08]: There you go.

416
00:39:20,967 --> 00:39:27,312
[SPEAKER_08]: So, I know, could we make cards for Yaris and get those printed, and I can give those to, like, it's like giving someone a fruitcake for Christmas?

417
00:39:28,013 --> 00:39:28,873
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it's free.

418
00:39:29,414 --> 00:39:30,274
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be kind of funny.

419
00:39:30,595 --> 00:39:33,997
[SPEAKER_03]: But even, like, you know, not necessarily that, but, like, custom...

420
00:39:34,838 --> 00:39:35,278
[SPEAKER_03]: and DarkSakura.com.

421
00:39:58,874 --> 00:39:59,174
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

422
00:39:59,434 --> 00:40:00,034
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of cool.

423
00:40:22,241 --> 00:40:25,883
[SPEAKER_08]: and, by the way, this is coming out here in the U.S.

424
00:40:26,183 --> 00:40:27,724
[SPEAKER_08]: This is being localized.

425
00:40:29,184 --> 00:40:30,705
[SPEAKER_08]: By whom is it being localized?

426
00:40:31,746 --> 00:40:33,426
[SPEAKER_10]: Some brave, brave soul.

427
00:40:34,847 --> 00:40:38,789
[SPEAKER_08]: To be honest, I think Axe AK Sis is the name of the company.

428
00:40:38,809 --> 00:40:40,009
[SPEAKER_03]: Axe is game localization.

429
00:40:40,170 --> 00:40:43,031
[SPEAKER_03]: The company I was talking about that localizes obscure shit.

430
00:40:43,171 --> 00:40:45,272
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello, this would be a perfect candidate.

431
00:40:45,712 --> 00:40:46,853
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

432
00:41:05,129 --> 00:41:28,190
[SPEAKER_08]: Joe Aniki Zero being localized for the US as if there's an audience for this because a lot of people look at this and go LOL WTF because yes if you don't already know it's all about like muscle bound guys wearing thong and all this muscle man-tastic voyage I believe that press reliefs even said about it I mean this is a ludicrous freaking game

433
00:41:30,586 --> 00:41:32,807
[SPEAKER_08]: And the SNES one came out in Virtual Console?

434
00:41:53,379 --> 00:42:14,515
[SPEAKER_08]: but there's an audience for this so I just can't it's funny to me that there's an audience for this yet President Cat you know doesn't apparently have an audience over here and it's going to end up in bargain bins across America so it's just interesting so yeah as Loki said there's your perfect candidate company for someone to bring the kitty cat games over with we'll see

435
00:42:15,407 --> 00:42:20,331
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, how about something that is no surprise to anybody?

436
00:42:20,752 --> 00:42:22,373
[SPEAKER_10]: What's that?

437
00:42:22,773 --> 00:42:27,317
[SPEAKER_10]: Microsoft has poo-pooed on any thoughts of having Blu-ray on Xbox 360.

438
00:42:28,879 --> 00:42:29,879
[SPEAKER_10]: Which we sort of knew.

439
00:42:32,003 --> 00:42:38,530
[SPEAKER_10]: They were talking about, Microsoft was actually talking about Blu-ray accessories for the PC, but not for the Xbox 360.

440
00:42:38,570 --> 00:42:43,415
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I think some interview some dude did with some website earlier this week.

441
00:42:43,656 --> 00:42:44,557
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's so professional.

442
00:42:44,597 --> 00:42:45,758
[SPEAKER_08]: Some dude at some website.

443
00:42:45,898 --> 00:42:50,323
[SPEAKER_10]: It's pretty much the boss, Steve Ballmer, said, uh-uh.

444
00:42:50,603 --> 00:42:56,005
[SPEAKER_08]: But a lot of people interpreted him to say that these Blu-ray... Oh, Blu-ray for Xbox 360 imminent.

445
00:42:56,485 --> 00:42:58,165
[SPEAKER_08]: I saw that all over Twitter that night.

446
00:42:58,585 --> 00:42:59,666
[SPEAKER_08]: Blu-ray's coming to Xbox 360.

447
00:42:59,706 --> 00:43:03,047
[SPEAKER_10]: That was me rolling my eyes and going, no.

448
00:43:03,327 --> 00:43:03,547
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

449
00:43:04,147 --> 00:43:06,348
[SPEAKER_08]: Why would Microsoft put out a Sony product?

450
00:43:06,388 --> 00:43:08,388
[SPEAKER_08]: Especially... And you know, they kind of make a good point.

451
00:43:08,728 --> 00:43:13,850
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's funny enough because, yet again, here's something we just talked about two weeks ago on the show or even last week.

452
00:43:14,290 --> 00:43:17,591
[SPEAKER_08]: I think before all that cat madness started, we were talking about how...

453
00:43:18,691 --> 00:43:21,952
[SPEAKER_08]: One thing that Sony has that Microsoft doesn't have is Blu-ray.

454
00:43:22,372 --> 00:43:27,354
[SPEAKER_08]: And if Microsoft was smart, they would be selling the streaming video, the Netflix.

455
00:43:27,394 --> 00:43:37,917
[SPEAKER_08]: And sure enough, when they kind of backpedaled on what the dude had said earlier in the week, they said, hey, we're going to be the only system with streaming 1080p very soon.

456
00:43:39,318 --> 00:43:42,519
[SPEAKER_08]: So they're kind of saying you don't need Blu-ray when you have streaming video.

457
00:43:43,739 --> 00:43:43,939
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

458
00:43:45,410 --> 00:43:45,730
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

459
00:43:46,891 --> 00:43:48,631
[SPEAKER_10]: I like the Netflix Instant Queue stuff.

460
00:43:50,492 --> 00:43:55,194
[SPEAKER_08]: I like Netflix Instant Queue, but at the same time, I'm very proud this week of one of my purchases.

461
00:43:55,674 --> 00:43:59,375
[SPEAKER_08]: I bought the box collection of the Star Trek Next Generation movies.

462
00:43:59,756 --> 00:44:00,196
[SPEAKER_08]: That's right.

463
00:44:00,376 --> 00:44:02,737
[SPEAKER_08]: All four movies with Captain Picard and a bonus disc.

464
00:44:02,797 --> 00:44:03,497
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm very excited.

465
00:44:03,937 --> 00:44:04,417
[SPEAKER_08]: On Blu-ray.

466
00:44:04,437 --> 00:44:05,738
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's not something I would have wanted to download.

467
00:44:05,758 --> 00:44:06,818
[SPEAKER_10]: So you're bringing that over, right?

468
00:44:07,439 --> 00:44:08,679
[SPEAKER_08]: We could totally have a nerd-a-thon.

469
00:44:08,779 --> 00:44:09,639
[SPEAKER_08]: I am all over.

470
00:44:09,659 --> 00:44:11,080
[SPEAKER_10]: I actually haven't seen Insurrection.

471
00:44:12,298 --> 00:44:12,598
[SPEAKER_08]: What?

472
00:44:13,239 --> 00:44:14,621
[SPEAKER_10]: And I've got it on Laserdisc, I think.

473
00:44:14,741 --> 00:44:15,322
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh my gosh.

474
00:44:15,362 --> 00:44:18,928
[SPEAKER_08]: We should totally have a Blu-ray next Genathon with booze.

475
00:44:19,008 --> 00:44:20,651
[SPEAKER_10]: I have first contact on Laserdisc.

476
00:44:20,791 --> 00:44:21,392
[SPEAKER_08]: Can we drink?

477
00:44:22,053 --> 00:44:22,253
[SPEAKER_10]: Sure.

478
00:44:22,634 --> 00:44:22,974
[SPEAKER_08]: Awesome.

479
00:44:23,035 --> 00:44:24,076
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to have a nerdy slumber party.

480
00:44:24,116 --> 00:44:24,817
[SPEAKER_10]: I like Booze Mahal.

481
00:44:24,958 --> 00:44:25,619
[SPEAKER_08]: It would be awesome.

482
00:44:26,812 --> 00:44:28,653
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyhow, I don't know how we got off topic.

483
00:44:28,873 --> 00:44:33,794
[SPEAKER_08]: But for me, it's kind of the same thing going back to the story we were talking about earlier with the games being printed on demand.

484
00:44:34,454 --> 00:44:37,355
[SPEAKER_08]: I would not have downloaded the Star Trek collection.

485
00:44:38,075 --> 00:44:49,098
[SPEAKER_08]: And even though I could probably get a lot of these on Instant Netflix, it's just not the same as having the collection in your house anytime you want, put in the disc.

486
00:44:49,518 --> 00:44:52,259
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, but it's easier for me to watch stuff on my computer.

487
00:44:53,159 --> 00:44:55,180
[SPEAKER_08]: Is it just me or are Blu-rays seeming to get a little cheaper?

488
00:44:55,620 --> 00:44:56,960
[SPEAKER_10]: They're getting a little cheaper, not much.

489
00:44:57,861 --> 00:44:59,341
[SPEAKER_10]: You're finding used ones more often.

490
00:44:59,541 --> 00:45:01,522
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm finding a lot of sales now.

491
00:45:01,602 --> 00:45:03,042
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm seeing a lot of Blu-rays.

492
00:45:03,082 --> 00:45:04,163
[SPEAKER_08]: I was at Best Buy this week.

493
00:45:04,903 --> 00:45:08,364
[SPEAKER_08]: One game I didn't talk about during my gaming week because we've talked about it at length the past couple weeks.

494
00:45:08,404 --> 00:45:09,865
[SPEAKER_08]: I finally played the DJ Hero demo.

495
00:45:10,825 --> 00:45:12,086
[SPEAKER_08]: I was at Best Buy, and I was looking at Blu-rays.

496
00:45:12,106 --> 00:45:13,286
[SPEAKER_08]: They had a lot of Blu-rays available for $10, $15.

497
00:45:13,366 --> 00:45:14,687
[SPEAKER_08]: So, you know, they're starting to come the way of DVDs.

498
00:45:14,707 --> 00:45:16,547
[SPEAKER_08]: They're still a little more expensive than DVDs.

499
00:45:16,587 --> 00:45:19,109
[SPEAKER_08]: You can get DVDs for $4 at Walmart, but they're coming down a little bit, which is nice.

500
00:45:33,254 --> 00:45:36,579
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, let's move on with some more gaming news.

501
00:45:36,619 --> 00:45:40,644
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll get to release dates very soon and see if there's anything wacky coming out this week.

502
00:45:41,085 --> 00:45:42,206
[SPEAKER_08]: But first, some more news.

503
00:45:42,747 --> 00:45:48,215
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I don't know about another President Cat, but I'm all campaigned out.

504
00:45:49,068 --> 00:45:58,132
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so Xbox Live, the preview for the new fall update, they have sent out their first Wave 1 invites.

505
00:45:58,592 --> 00:46:02,013
[SPEAKER_03]: In fact, actually, I got one of those, so I have the new update.

506
00:46:02,794 --> 00:46:06,915
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't gotten a chance to play with a lot of the stuff on there, but I did do the Twitter thing.

507
00:46:07,316 --> 00:46:12,438
[SPEAKER_03]: And the problem I see is I don't think I'm going to use half this stuff.

508
00:46:12,678 --> 00:46:15,459
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, the Twitter and the Facebook stuff, it's neat.

509
00:46:17,313 --> 00:46:21,376
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you know how many tweets I saw this week that were, Hey, I'm posted from my 360!

510
00:46:21,836 --> 00:46:23,817
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just like, eye roll.

511
00:46:24,198 --> 00:46:26,139
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, we totally saw this coming.

512
00:46:26,399 --> 00:46:28,260
[SPEAKER_08]: Everybody's going to have to do that mandatory tweet.

513
00:46:28,540 --> 00:46:31,042
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey guys, I got in the preview program.

514
00:46:31,082 --> 00:46:31,722
[SPEAKER_08]: Here's my tweet from 360.

515
00:46:31,782 --> 00:46:34,024
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, I want to tell you guys a secret.

516
00:46:35,416 --> 00:46:38,219
[SPEAKER_08]: Almost everybody who signs up for these preview programs gets in.

517
00:46:38,259 --> 00:46:38,759
[SPEAKER_08]: You know why?

518
00:46:39,319 --> 00:46:41,541
[SPEAKER_08]: Because it's Microsoft's little way now.

519
00:46:41,862 --> 00:46:47,366
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you remember when their system crashed a couple years ago when they rolled out one of these updates because everybody was freaking downloading it at once?

520
00:46:47,707 --> 00:46:51,910
[SPEAKER_08]: This little preview program is their way of doing a rolling release for these updates.

521
00:46:52,691 --> 00:46:54,012
[SPEAKER_03]: Except they're going to have to re-download it.

522
00:46:54,052 --> 00:46:55,053
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not the full thing.

523
00:46:55,213 --> 00:46:55,714
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, really?

524
00:46:56,034 --> 00:46:56,214
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

525
00:46:56,354 --> 00:46:56,654
[SPEAKER_03]: Huh.

526
00:46:57,235 --> 00:46:57,575
[SPEAKER_03]: Interesting.

527
00:46:57,855 --> 00:47:00,458
[SPEAKER_03]: Because the music store isn't working yet.

528
00:47:00,738 --> 00:47:02,159
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, they have Lips on there and that's it.

529
00:47:02,660 --> 00:47:02,840
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

530
00:47:03,717 --> 00:47:07,700
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, so apparently a lot of people got in on it.

531
00:47:07,960 --> 00:47:09,921
[SPEAKER_03]: And they did have a lot of cool stuff in there.

532
00:47:09,941 --> 00:47:13,344
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, if you're in the UK, you got to check out the Sky Player and that kind of thing.

533
00:47:13,874 --> 00:47:21,976
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, over here in North America, you know, they had, of course, the Last.fm, you know, Facebook.

534
00:47:21,996 --> 00:47:23,477
[SPEAKER_08]: Did you check out the Last.fm by chance?

535
00:47:23,497 --> 00:47:23,797
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I haven't.

536
00:47:23,817 --> 00:47:27,278
[SPEAKER_08]: That's the one thing I am kind of curious about because I am a Last.fm user.

537
00:47:27,658 --> 00:47:30,379
[SPEAKER_08]: I prefer it to Pandora and the other services available out there.

538
00:47:30,759 --> 00:47:34,980
[SPEAKER_08]: I think they're great because the way it kind of syncs up with your iPod and everything with the Scrabbler.

539
00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:38,461
[SPEAKER_08]: And the recommendations have been, for the most part, pretty good.

540
00:47:38,901 --> 00:47:40,802
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm really curious to see what the Last.fm...

541
00:47:42,199 --> 00:47:44,540
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

542
00:48:10,865 --> 00:48:14,508
[SPEAKER_03]: DJ DarkKnight and GoldAnthro both saying you can't play them with your games.

543
00:48:14,528 --> 00:48:15,830
[SPEAKER_03]: Last.fm does not work with your game.

544
00:48:15,850 --> 00:48:16,150
[SPEAKER_03]: That's lame.

545
00:48:32,844 --> 00:48:34,065
[SPEAKER_08]: Synthpop and Spice Girls Mixed Together Epic

546
00:49:00,322 --> 00:49:00,862
[SPEAKER_08]: Very epic.

547
00:49:02,103 --> 00:49:05,406
[SPEAKER_08]: And Tiger Claw also confirms that the music stops playing when you exit out of it.

548
00:49:05,446 --> 00:49:09,048
[SPEAKER_08]: So it sounds like it's kind of like an independent application, kind of like Netflix is, basically.

549
00:49:09,388 --> 00:49:10,749
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, the movies stop when you leave Netflix.

550
00:49:10,769 --> 00:49:12,510
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, all the programs are kind of like that, too.

551
00:49:12,570 --> 00:49:19,595
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, you know, the Twitter and stuff, it kind of goes into its own program thing, and then you actually back out to the main menu when you're done.

552
00:49:20,716 --> 00:49:21,156
[SPEAKER_03]: Whatever.

553
00:49:21,236 --> 00:49:25,880
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, if I really am that desperate to check Twitter and stuff, I guess that would be handy.

554
00:49:26,200 --> 00:49:27,341
[SPEAKER_03]: It might be useful, like, if I...

555
00:49:28,484 --> 00:49:29,565
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

556
00:49:55,322 --> 00:49:57,226
[SPEAKER_08]: That is a very good question.

557
00:49:57,406 --> 00:50:02,376
[SPEAKER_08]: That is one thing that Xbox is sorely lacking, and these are the people that make Internet Explorer.

558
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:04,780
[SPEAKER_03]: Why?

559
00:50:05,240 --> 00:50:16,084
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there not... Unless, you know, because Internet Explorer is, you know, kind of a magnet for bugs and all sorts of exploits and whatnot, that they're worried that somehow they're going to find a way around it.

560
00:50:16,104 --> 00:50:21,687
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, people playing, like, emulated games, like Nintendo games in a Flash browser or something, you know?

561
00:50:22,247 --> 00:50:23,247
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that what they're worried about, maybe?

562
00:50:23,367 --> 00:50:23,707
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe.

563
00:50:24,408 --> 00:50:28,789
[SPEAKER_08]: But I would think that with maybe Facebook or something, you might be able to kind of exploit something, too.

564
00:50:28,909 --> 00:50:32,691
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, I never even thought to do that on the PlayStation, because the PlayStation has a decent web browser.

565
00:50:33,391 --> 00:50:38,753
[SPEAKER_08]: But is it just me, or are both the PlayStation and the Wii, their web browsers, just kind of clunky?

566
00:50:39,093 --> 00:50:41,393
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, they just don't work like it does on a computer.

567
00:50:41,673 --> 00:50:47,635
[SPEAKER_08]: And, I don't know, especially when I'm using the YouTube TV site, they're so slow to load.

568
00:50:47,695 --> 00:50:52,137
[SPEAKER_10]: That's been the hang-up of any type of web system on a console.

569
00:50:53,157 --> 00:50:53,717
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, really.

570
00:50:53,837 --> 00:50:54,237
[SPEAKER_08]: You think?

571
00:50:54,417 --> 00:50:56,898
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, but isn't the PS3 supposed to be a computer?

572
00:50:58,038 --> 00:50:58,618
[SPEAKER_10]: So they said.

573
00:50:58,658 --> 00:51:00,519
[SPEAKER_10]: I think they did it just for the tax cut, remember?

574
00:51:01,095 --> 00:51:01,435
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess.

575
00:51:02,356 --> 00:51:05,057
[SPEAKER_08]: They seem a little clunky to me.

576
00:51:05,357 --> 00:51:08,398
[SPEAKER_08]: You guys have been to my house.

577
00:51:08,418 --> 00:51:12,260
[SPEAKER_08]: When I have a lot of people over, we'll fire up YouTube and watch funny things.

578
00:51:12,460 --> 00:51:15,641
[SPEAKER_08]: It's really good to be able to do it on the Wii or the PlayStation 3.

579
00:51:15,781 --> 00:51:18,102
[SPEAKER_08]: I love that new YouTube channel, but it's slow and clunky.

580
00:51:18,783 --> 00:51:19,403
[SPEAKER_10]: You know what I say?

581
00:51:19,423 --> 00:51:23,625
[SPEAKER_10]: If you want to run anything off the internet on your TV, build a multimedia box.

582
00:51:25,154 --> 00:51:31,637
[SPEAKER_10]: I guess, but... Especially now with an HDTV, it's so cheap and easy to do.

583
00:51:32,778 --> 00:51:38,080
[SPEAKER_08]: DJ Dark Knight does say in chat, I do like how on Last.fm they do have video game music stations.

584
00:51:38,140 --> 00:51:38,921
[SPEAKER_08]: I wasn't aware of that.

585
00:51:39,121 --> 00:51:39,921
[SPEAKER_08]: That's kind of interesting.

586
00:51:40,702 --> 00:51:41,722
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm going to have to check this out.

587
00:51:41,982 --> 00:51:45,024
[SPEAKER_08]: You know I'm going on like 60 days since I've played an Xbox 360.

588
00:51:45,524 --> 00:51:47,485
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm like, I've been all PlayStation 3 lately.

589
00:51:48,005 --> 00:51:49,306
[SPEAKER_08]: So, very interesting.

590
00:51:50,206 --> 00:51:56,032
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyhow, speaking of PlayStation 3, I signed into Home and there were like six requests to join our club, so I approved them all.

591
00:51:56,072 --> 00:52:03,819
[SPEAKER_08]: So if you want to join the Sony Home Club for Orange Lounge Radio, look for us on the search and add us before we fill up.

592
00:52:05,888 --> 00:52:06,088
[SPEAKER_08]: Fable 3

593
00:52:35,888 --> 00:52:37,529
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

594
00:53:01,670 --> 00:53:02,974
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, this is starting to get a little cheap.

595
00:53:03,094 --> 00:53:03,515
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?

596
00:53:03,535 --> 00:53:04,859
[SPEAKER_10]: That's getting silly.

597
00:53:04,899 --> 00:53:05,441
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry.

598
00:53:05,541 --> 00:53:07,005
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's my problem with it.

599
00:53:07,146 --> 00:53:09,252
[SPEAKER_03]: It's Fable 3, and I'm sorry.

600
00:53:10,444 --> 00:53:11,325
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

601
00:53:37,113 --> 00:53:38,974
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just going to bypass the whole game altogether.

602
00:53:39,635 --> 00:53:42,637
[SPEAKER_03]: Unless there's something that's really awesome that I must play in this.

603
00:53:43,258 --> 00:53:47,901
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I guess it's where we're going to be going with it.

604
00:53:48,682 --> 00:53:53,025
[SPEAKER_08]: It's the trend that's showing up that I'm getting really nervous about.

605
00:53:53,065 --> 00:53:55,127
[SPEAKER_08]: But the bottom line is, if you don't like it, don't buy it.

606
00:53:55,427 --> 00:53:56,788
[SPEAKER_08]: Show them that you're not going to support it.

607
00:53:56,868 --> 00:53:58,549
[SPEAKER_08]: That's really what it boils down to in the end.

608
00:53:58,910 --> 00:54:01,292
[SPEAKER_08]: But it's just kind of sad that it's going there in the first place.

609
00:54:01,352 --> 00:54:02,412
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm still going to buy Fable 3.

610
00:54:02,533 --> 00:54:05,295
[SPEAKER_08]: I loved Fable 2 and the first Fable was good too.

611
00:54:05,355 --> 00:54:06,876
[SPEAKER_08]: No matter what, I'm going to buy it.

612
00:54:09,538 --> 00:54:12,200
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll just get my upgrades naturally.

613
00:54:35,256 --> 00:54:35,656
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I agree.

614
00:54:35,676 --> 00:54:36,396
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, you did.

615
00:54:36,416 --> 00:54:36,637
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

616
00:55:03,686 --> 00:55:05,328
[SPEAKER_08]: It totally sucks when something like that happens.

617
00:55:05,529 --> 00:55:07,191
[SPEAKER_08]: So I totally agree with their stance.

618
00:55:07,511 --> 00:55:17,786
[SPEAKER_08]: If you buy gold online, you suck because you're supporting this practice of hacking accounts like mine and supporting keyloggers and funding this, basically.

619
00:55:17,906 --> 00:55:19,789
[SPEAKER_08]: So don't buy gold online.

620
00:55:21,266 --> 00:55:25,490
[SPEAKER_08]: One other thing I wanted to state, although Matt kind of stated it, it was circulated also this week.

621
00:55:25,970 --> 00:55:28,192
[SPEAKER_08]: Project Natal will be supported in Fable 3.

622
00:55:28,312 --> 00:55:37,621
[SPEAKER_08]: That, of course, should come as no surprise at all since Peter Molyneux was, of course, out there at E3 this year kind of promoting Project Natal.

623
00:55:37,641 --> 00:55:39,122
[SPEAKER_08]: But there will be support for it in Fable 3.

624
00:55:40,223 --> 00:55:41,224
[SPEAKER_08]: What will it do?

625
00:55:41,244 --> 00:55:42,485
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

626
00:55:42,905 --> 00:55:46,488
[SPEAKER_08]: Wait till the game comes out.

627
00:55:46,668 --> 00:55:47,269
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what it does.

628
00:55:47,769 --> 00:55:48,130
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

629
00:55:49,380 --> 00:55:52,182
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, you know, there's something else going on that's, I think, a little stinky.

630
00:55:52,743 --> 00:55:54,664
[SPEAKER_10]: Very much like the weapon upgrade business.

631
00:55:57,006 --> 00:56:02,030
[SPEAKER_10]: There's a game that's called Parachute Panic that's on iPhone and iPod Touch.

632
00:56:02,831 --> 00:56:06,454
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm allergic to it.

633
00:56:07,809 --> 00:56:08,709
[SPEAKER_10]: Actually, there's dust in the room.

634
00:56:09,630 --> 00:56:16,832
[SPEAKER_10]: But now, on the last version that came out, you can pay 99 cents to unlock another five lives.

635
00:56:16,892 --> 00:56:18,093
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's a 99 cent game already.

636
00:56:18,753 --> 00:56:28,036
[SPEAKER_10]: So, I mean, you can just do it in-game, but for the impatient people who want more lives, then you just pay for it.

637
00:56:28,197 --> 00:56:29,077
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it's kind of stupid.

638
00:56:30,920 --> 00:56:31,260
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I agree.

639
00:56:31,280 --> 00:56:33,701
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's really just encouraging gamer laziness really.

640
00:57:00,009 --> 00:57:02,051
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of like EA and their cheat codes, remember?

641
00:57:02,211 --> 00:57:03,992
[SPEAKER_03]: Stuff that normally would be in a game for free.

642
00:57:04,052 --> 00:57:05,994
[SPEAKER_03]: But hey, now we can sell it for two bucks.

643
00:57:09,934 --> 00:57:17,297
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't have as much of a problem with it if it's something that you can achieve in the game otherwise, especially single player.

644
00:57:17,578 --> 00:57:21,660
[SPEAKER_08]: Keep in mind when I ranted about WoW, that's a multiplayer experience and much different.

645
00:57:21,980 --> 00:57:31,845
[SPEAKER_08]: But a single player game, you know what, if you want to use cheats to your heart's content in a single player game where you're not interacting with other people going online or what have you, go for it.

646
00:57:32,065 --> 00:57:35,247
[SPEAKER_08]: And if you want to pay two bucks because you're too lazy to get it yourself, fine.

647
00:57:36,107 --> 00:57:40,671
[SPEAKER_08]: But as long as the option is there for you to still get it yourself and work towards it, I think it's okay.

648
00:57:41,132 --> 00:57:42,773
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just not something I would probably do.

649
00:57:43,914 --> 00:57:47,637
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it's more fun if you... I think anything worth having is worth working for.

650
00:57:48,838 --> 00:57:50,320
[SPEAKER_10]: Even if it's in a game or not.

651
00:57:51,767 --> 00:58:03,414
[SPEAKER_08]: I am behind on some chatroom comments, so I want to read some comments from our chatroom, chat.orangeloungeradio.com Salacious Pop says, it could just be rose-colored glasses, but Dreamcast's browser was pretty good.

652
00:58:04,014 --> 00:58:05,115
[SPEAKER_08]: Kind of going back a ways back.

653
00:58:05,135 --> 00:58:05,955
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, it was decent.

654
00:58:05,975 --> 00:58:06,536
[SPEAKER_08]: For the time.

655
00:58:06,756 --> 00:58:06,956
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

656
00:58:07,076 --> 00:58:13,640
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, you have to kind of say, okay, well, you know, that was 1999, this is before kind of web browsers were standard like that.

657
00:58:13,960 --> 00:58:16,402
[SPEAKER_08]: What did Dreamcast's browser have to compete with, WebTV?

658
00:58:16,422 --> 00:58:16,502
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

659
00:58:17,703 --> 00:58:20,505
[SPEAKER_08]: So yeah, I think for its time, it was certainly pretty good.

660
00:58:21,526 --> 00:58:26,051
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's see, Redertainment says the store in Fable 3 will be good, but the store in Fable 4 will be awesome.

661
00:58:27,301 --> 00:58:30,924
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's hope that it's not more of this nickel and diming stuff, but I'm sure it will be.

662
00:58:31,985 --> 00:58:33,306
[SPEAKER_08]: Also a question from Red Entertainment.

663
00:58:33,386 --> 00:58:36,388
[SPEAKER_08]: If Natal gets delayed, will Fable 3 get delayed?

664
00:58:36,708 --> 00:58:41,492
[SPEAKER_08]: And Seg replies with his thought, maybe not unless Microsoft wants it as a launch product.

665
00:58:41,552 --> 00:58:45,515
[SPEAKER_08]: I assume Fable 3 is an add-on support for Natal rather than a requirement.

666
00:58:46,056 --> 00:58:47,297
[SPEAKER_08]: So I guess, yeah, that's a good thought.

667
00:58:47,337 --> 00:58:50,079
[SPEAKER_08]: It depends on how much Natal is integrated into this game.

668
00:58:50,459 --> 00:58:55,023
[SPEAKER_08]: If it's like a required part of the game, then yeah, Natal delay is going to affect the game, but

669
00:58:55,623 --> 00:59:00,987
[SPEAKER_08]: If it's just kind of a, hey, a bonus little game or a bonus little quest, then maybe not.

670
00:59:01,327 --> 00:59:05,691
[SPEAKER_08]: I could see that kind of being the case, is that there's a download expansion that uses Natal or something like that.

671
00:59:06,011 --> 00:59:07,972
[SPEAKER_08]: It would be kind of interesting, I suppose.

672
00:59:11,215 --> 00:59:14,477
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, moving right along into some release dates.

673
00:59:14,657 --> 00:59:16,919

684
01:00:12,980 --> 01:00:16,342
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, they may have kids that watch Nick Jr., and that is important.

[SPEAKER_03]: Forza Motorsports 3 on Xbox 360 CSI Deadly Intent on DS and Wii I think PS3 and Xbox 360 as well this one's for Rob Press Your Luck 2010 coming out on PC, Wii, and I believe DS as well but if it's not Peter Tamarkin then I don't give a crap and I don't see how that'll be possible because he's kind of dead

699
01:02:00,005 --> 01:02:01,186
[SPEAKER_08]: What's his name?

700
01:02:01,226 --> 01:02:01,807
[SPEAKER_08]: Todd Newton?

701
01:02:02,207 --> 01:02:03,068
[SPEAKER_08]: Can't stand him.

702
01:02:03,088 --> 01:02:04,669
[SPEAKER_08]: He's like the worst game show host ever.

703
01:02:04,689 --> 01:02:05,329
[SPEAKER_03]: Reanimation.

704
01:02:05,409 --> 01:02:05,990
[SPEAKER_08]: Ruined whammy.

705
01:02:06,610 --> 01:02:11,674
[SPEAKER_03]: And going back to the roots of this show, Dance Dance Revolution Hot Party 3 making its way out from Konami.

706
01:02:12,015 --> 01:02:15,557
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, all these games now kind of blend together because they all kind of suck.

707
01:02:17,078 --> 01:02:23,904
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe also to kind of go with that, DDRX2 will be coming out as well in the bundle on PlayStation 2.

708
01:02:24,384 --> 01:02:28,287
[SPEAKER_03]: They only sell these games in a bundle now because they want you to buy those crappy dance pads to go with them.

709
01:02:30,401 --> 01:02:39,127
[SPEAKER_03]: and Hamster's Bunch on PSP because God forbid if the PSP be devoid of crappy pet games.

710
01:02:40,788 --> 01:02:42,389
[SPEAKER_03]: And Dream Salon on DS.

711
01:02:43,369 --> 01:02:44,210
[SPEAKER_03]: That's going to be crap.

712
01:02:45,751 --> 01:02:47,712
[SPEAKER_03]: And finally, stuff coming out a week from now.

713
01:02:52,046 --> 01:02:53,366
[SPEAKER_03]: Rabbids Go Home would be the last.

714
01:02:53,486 --> 01:02:55,447
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, Ratchet and Clank, Crack in Time.

715
01:02:55,587 --> 01:02:57,708
[SPEAKER_03]: That's another title that will be coming out this week as well.

716
01:02:58,168 --> 01:03:00,149
[SPEAKER_08]: I've got to read some comments from chat if you're done.

717
01:03:00,529 --> 01:03:00,809
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm done.

718
01:03:01,109 --> 01:03:04,910
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkTituya says, Sky, three words, Zombie Peter Tamarkin.

719
01:03:05,511 --> 01:03:05,831
[SPEAKER_08]: Awesome.

720
01:03:07,332 --> 01:03:08,413
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's see, what else was said here?

721
01:03:08,493 --> 01:03:11,095
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, SalaciousPop says, I'd play a Nick Jr.

722
01:03:11,396 --> 01:03:12,937
[SPEAKER_08]: Eureka's Castle FPS.

723
01:03:13,658 --> 01:03:14,819
[SPEAKER_02]: Hell yeah!

724
01:03:14,839 --> 01:03:16,180
[SPEAKER_08]: That would be kind of cool.

725
01:03:16,220 --> 01:03:19,163
[SPEAKER_08]: Exactly, where are the Nickelodeon games for me?

726
01:03:20,024 --> 01:03:21,025
[SPEAKER_08]: Screw the children!

727
01:03:21,325 --> 01:03:23,107
[SPEAKER_08]: I want my Nickelodeon games.

728
01:03:23,187 --> 01:03:27,471
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, for instance, can I get like a You Can't Do That on Television minigame collection?

729
01:03:28,071 --> 01:03:37,298
[SPEAKER_08]: or like, Hey Dude, Explore the Ranch Game, or Salute Your Shorts, you know, so Are You Afraid of the Dark?

730
01:03:37,418 --> 01:03:44,803
[SPEAKER_03]: The best episode of Salute Your Shorts had to have been, was it, the Water Balloon Capture the Flag episode, my favorite.

731
01:03:46,064 --> 01:03:48,345
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank You, Seg, Legends of the Hidden Temple.

732
01:03:49,566 --> 01:03:49,946
[SPEAKER_08]: Guts.

733
01:03:50,106 --> 01:03:52,047
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually, they did have a Guts game on Super Nintendo, didn't they?

734
01:03:52,067 --> 01:03:52,767
[SPEAKER_10]: Nick Arcade.

735
01:03:52,787 --> 01:03:53,307
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I know.

736
01:03:53,587 --> 01:04:00,389
[SPEAKER_08]: How about reviving one of these old, like, classic frickin'... For all I care, do a fuckin' today's special video game.

737
01:04:00,509 --> 01:04:01,089
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't care.

738
01:04:01,189 --> 01:04:03,129
[SPEAKER_08]: Just give me something I remember from my childhood.

739
01:04:03,149 --> 01:04:03,529
[SPEAKER_03]: David the Gnome?

740
01:04:04,369 --> 01:04:05,550
[SPEAKER_10]: Dude, David the Gnome was great.

741
01:04:05,590 --> 01:04:06,690
[SPEAKER_08]: Turkey Television.

742
01:04:08,890 --> 01:04:11,351
[SPEAKER_08]: Tell me you wouldn't play a Turkey Television, like, shooting game.

743
01:04:11,371 --> 01:04:12,171
[SPEAKER_08]: It'd be amazing.

744
01:04:12,591 --> 01:04:13,812
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, they do have Chicken Shoot.

745
01:04:13,832 --> 01:04:14,572
[SPEAKER_03]: That's kinda close.

746
01:04:14,712 --> 01:04:15,152
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess so.

747
01:04:16,960 --> 01:04:19,182
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, let's go to Japanese release dates.

748
01:04:19,242 --> 01:04:21,884
[SPEAKER_08]: Is there anything that's going to make us go crazy this week?

749
01:04:22,425 --> 01:04:27,449
[SPEAKER_08]: Probably not, because Japan's getting a lot of the titles that are big and expected for us over here this week.

750
01:04:27,489 --> 01:04:29,891
[SPEAKER_08]: And Japanese releases this week on the Xbox 360.

751
01:04:30,051 --> 01:04:37,718
[SPEAKER_08]: Bayonetta makes its way to the Xbox 360 on October 29th, as well as Tekken 6, of course, is a big deal over there, just as it is over here.

752
01:04:38,098 --> 01:04:45,024
[SPEAKER_08]: Those both coming out to the Xbox 360, and of course, just in time for Tekken 6, another Hori arcade stick with the Tekken 6 design on it.

753
01:04:45,484 --> 01:04:47,965
[SPEAKER_08]: If you'd care to import one of those from Japan.

754
01:04:48,225 --> 01:04:49,626
[SPEAKER_08]: Or you can just get them here in the bundle.

755
01:04:50,166 --> 01:04:50,406
[SPEAKER_08]: Fine.

756
01:04:50,826 --> 01:04:53,407
[SPEAKER_08]: Or on the PlayStation 3, you could get Bayonetta there.

757
01:04:53,667 --> 01:04:55,328
[SPEAKER_08]: Or the, again, Tekken 6.

758
01:04:55,648 --> 01:04:57,428
[SPEAKER_08]: There's also a game getting a price reduction.

759
01:04:57,448 --> 01:05:01,110
[SPEAKER_08]: That's Samurai Do 3 Plus getting a price reduction this week.

760
01:05:01,150 --> 01:05:03,170
[SPEAKER_08]: So those are the big releases on the 360 PS3 combo.

761
01:05:05,251 --> 01:05:08,134
[SPEAKER_08]: Dipping into Nintendo Wii, we have some different alternate titles.

762
01:05:08,474 --> 01:05:09,676
[SPEAKER_08]: Another Dragon Ball title.

763
01:05:10,316 --> 01:05:11,517
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sorry, that's a US date.

764
01:05:11,998 --> 01:05:14,080
[SPEAKER_08]: Chin Sports makes its way to Japan.

765
01:05:14,580 --> 01:05:17,663
[SPEAKER_08]: This is kind of a minigame collection that's wacky and weird sports.

766
01:05:18,324 --> 01:05:20,346
[SPEAKER_08]: This is the one that has the extreme ironing.

767
01:05:20,706 --> 01:05:24,309
[SPEAKER_08]: I think this came up on the show a few weeks ago.

768
01:05:24,369 --> 01:05:25,530
[SPEAKER_08]: It came out last month.

769
01:05:25,730 --> 01:05:27,031
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, for here in the US.

770
01:05:27,131 --> 01:05:29,453
[SPEAKER_08]: The Japanese are getting their own version of that.

771
01:05:30,154 --> 01:05:32,856
[SPEAKER_08]: Probably what people care a little more about would be Sin and Punishment 2.

772
01:05:32,976 --> 01:05:35,338
[SPEAKER_08]: That is finally being released on Nintendo Wii this week.

773
01:05:36,179 --> 01:05:41,764
[SPEAKER_08]: Super Robot Taisen Neo comes out as well because there just wasn't enough Super Robot Taisen games.

774
01:05:42,304 --> 01:05:43,826
[SPEAKER_08]: Hikari no 4 Senshi Final Fantasy Gaiden Side Story

775
01:06:06,027 --> 01:06:16,336
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, and it's that same style of like Final Fantasy 3 DS and the Final Fantasy 12 spin-off game, but don't expect it to play like your other Final Fantasy games.

776
01:06:16,536 --> 01:06:17,537
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a little bit different.

777
01:06:19,238 --> 01:06:22,181
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what I miss as far as Final Fantasy spin-off games go?

778
01:06:22,261 --> 01:06:25,804
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what my favorite, like seriously my favorite Final Fantasy spin-off game was?

779
01:06:26,104 --> 01:06:27,045
[SPEAKER_08]: Tease Me All You Want.

780
01:06:27,345 --> 01:06:28,746
[SPEAKER_08]: I fucking love Chocobo Racing.

781
01:06:28,766 --> 01:06:30,087
[SPEAKER_08]: That game is amazing.

782
01:06:30,127 --> 01:06:31,889
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I know a lot of people who love that one.

783
01:06:31,969 --> 01:06:33,250
[SPEAKER_08]: I wish they would make another one.

784
01:06:33,270 --> 01:06:34,111
[SPEAKER_08]: I love that game.

785
01:06:35,063 --> 01:06:36,004
[SPEAKER_08]: That was perfect for the Wii.

786
01:06:37,325 --> 01:06:42,909
[SPEAKER_08]: Or give me my extreme chocobo racing on the PlayStation 3 just in time for Final Fantasy XIII.

787
01:06:43,029 --> 01:06:46,772
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, you reminded me, I forgot two major titles and I don't understand how I did that.

788
01:06:47,072 --> 01:06:49,894
[SPEAKER_03]: Fairytale Fights was coming out on Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3.

789
01:06:50,474 --> 01:06:51,795
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude, how did I forget this?

790
01:06:51,835 --> 01:06:55,398
[SPEAKER_03]: Grand Theft Auto Episodes of Liberty City on Xbox 360 this week.

791
01:06:55,438 --> 01:06:55,798
[SPEAKER_03]: Fail.

792
01:06:55,998 --> 01:06:57,940
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I think most people think of that as a download title.

793
01:06:58,761 --> 01:06:59,721
[SPEAKER_03]: It's still going to be awesome.

794
01:06:59,961 --> 01:07:00,322
[SPEAKER_08]: It's true.

795
01:07:01,192 --> 01:07:02,313
[SPEAKER_08]: Fairytale Fighters.

796
01:07:02,393 --> 01:07:03,455
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that what it sounds like?

797
01:07:03,475 --> 01:07:04,336
[SPEAKER_08]: No, Fairytale Fights.

798
01:07:04,636 --> 01:07:09,181
[SPEAKER_03]: Think of it as like Castle Crashers but with fairytale characters.

799
01:07:09,321 --> 01:07:10,142
[SPEAKER_03]: It's brutal.

800
01:07:10,583 --> 01:07:12,085
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like blood and guts everywhere.

801
01:07:12,105 --> 01:07:13,687
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, you talked about this on a previous show.

802
01:07:13,747 --> 01:07:14,968
[SPEAKER_08]: This sounded awesome.

803
01:07:14,988 --> 01:07:16,410
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to have to check that out.

804
01:07:16,710 --> 01:07:18,272
[SPEAKER_08]: Is it cheap or is it like 60 bucks?

805
01:07:18,752 --> 01:07:19,133
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's like 50.

806
01:07:20,755 --> 01:07:25,058
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll wait for the bargain bin, because that's... You want to talk about a game that'll end up in the bargain bin?

807
01:07:25,558 --> 01:07:25,898
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's see.

808
01:07:26,319 --> 01:07:30,582
[SPEAKER_08]: We can't really sell this game to children, and adults probably won't take it very seriously either.

809
01:07:31,743 --> 01:07:35,446
[SPEAKER_08]: We could market this to the people that bought the Red Riding Hood zombie game on the DS.

810
01:07:36,407 --> 01:07:38,508
[SPEAKER_08]: That's probably the target market for this.

811
01:07:38,888 --> 01:07:40,209
[SPEAKER_08]: It's got to be the same company, right?

812
01:07:41,010 --> 01:07:41,250
[SPEAKER_04]: Nope.

813
01:07:41,350 --> 01:07:41,571
[SPEAKER_04]: Right?

814
01:07:42,671 --> 01:07:43,392
[SPEAKER_03]: That was Zoo Games.

815
01:07:43,952 --> 01:07:44,153
[SPEAKER_03]: It did...

816
01:07:46,418 --> 01:07:49,280
[SPEAKER_03]: Red Riding Hood Zombie BBQ Yeah, that was it.

817
01:07:49,320 --> 01:07:50,900
[SPEAKER_08]: That was an awesome game.

818
01:07:50,960 --> 01:07:52,441
[SPEAKER_08]: I played it at PAX, I think.

819
01:07:52,461 --> 01:07:53,561
[SPEAKER_08]: It was either PAX or E3.

820
01:07:54,962 --> 01:07:58,343
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it was PAX.

821
01:07:59,184 --> 01:08:04,686
[SPEAKER_08]: And SalaciousPop reminded me in chat there saying I only got maybe 7-8 hours in the Tactics titles.

822
01:08:04,766 --> 01:08:08,447
[SPEAKER_08]: I suppose Final Fantasy Tactics is a pretty notable spin-off of the Final Fantasy series.

823
01:08:08,928 --> 01:08:09,668
[SPEAKER_08]: But you know what's sad?

824
01:08:10,188 --> 01:08:14,070
[SPEAKER_08]: I probably spent more time playing Chocobo Racing than the Final Fantasy Tactics games.

825
01:08:15,421 --> 01:08:35,948
[SPEAKER_08]: that's for sure quickly I wanted to mention on the PSP just because I think this name is hilarious it's R-Type Tactics 2 yes the R-Type Tactical game remember that is actually getting a sequel and the sequel is called Operation Bitter Chocolate I can't make that up that is the real name of the game Operation Bitter Chocolate so would that be Dark Chocolate?

826
01:08:36,308 --> 01:08:37,148
[SPEAKER_08]: Baker's Chocolate?

827
01:08:37,248 --> 01:08:44,731
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know that's what it's called Operation Semi-Sweet Chocolate with a little bit of nuts Operation I don't get it

828
01:08:45,902 --> 01:08:53,668
[SPEAKER_08]: Grand Theft Auto IV, The Ballad of Gay Tony, Aggressed Generations of War, Borderlands, DJ Hero, Fallout 3 Game of the Year Edition, Football Manager 2010, Tekken 6, Feel, Wii Fit Plus, and Yoga for Wii.

829
01:09:10,549 --> 01:09:20,552
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, we're going to get to the classic game of the week very, very soon here, but just two more stories for you guys real quick, and then the break, and then our interview with our pal Seg about Umlaut right after the break tonight.

830
01:09:21,033 --> 01:09:28,415
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, since we were talking a little bit about fairytale fights, they did have an achievement at one point for killing children in this.

831
01:09:28,955 --> 01:09:35,737
[SPEAKER_03]: So not to be outdone, of course, Dante's Inferno, the game full of great ideas and awesome promotions.

832
01:09:37,438 --> 01:09:43,504
[SPEAKER_03]: is now getting some flack for an achievement called Bad Nanny.

833
01:09:44,485 --> 01:09:47,748
[SPEAKER_03]: And this achievement is... You've been a very bad nanny.

834
01:09:47,829 --> 01:09:49,270
[SPEAKER_03]: I can just see Super Nanny.

835
01:09:49,530 --> 01:09:52,753
[SPEAKER_08]: This achievement is... You need to go and sit on the naughty step.

836
01:09:53,494 --> 01:09:54,595
[SPEAKER_08]: You've been very naughty.

837
01:09:54,956 --> 01:09:59,200
[SPEAKER_03]: Apparently this achievement is for killing unbaptized babies in the game.

838
01:09:59,994 --> 01:10:00,635
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for watching!

839
01:10:18,323 --> 01:10:19,904
[SPEAKER_03]: Do they not have a sense of humor?

840
01:10:20,184 --> 01:10:25,727
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, this isn't saying that, like, you know, bad International Nanny Association or something like that.

841
01:10:25,847 --> 01:10:31,590
[SPEAKER_08]: My mom was a nanny, actually, for many, many years, and I can verify they do not have a sense of humor.

842
01:10:32,811 --> 01:10:35,192
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually, my mom's hilarious, but I don't think she'd find that funny.

843
01:10:35,652 --> 01:10:36,372
[SPEAKER_10]: Your mom's a hoot.

844
01:10:36,913 --> 01:10:40,054
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a video game about hell.

845
01:10:40,174 --> 01:10:42,956
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, they've got walls made out of writhing naked people.

846
01:10:42,996 --> 01:10:46,998
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, this isn't exactly... This isn't saying you should go kill babies.

847
01:10:48,103 --> 01:10:49,004
[SPEAKER_03]: Just demon babies.

848
01:10:49,725 --> 01:10:51,146
[SPEAKER_08]: Are you saying we should go kill babies?

849
01:10:51,506 --> 01:10:52,727
[SPEAKER_03]: Demon babies, okay?

850
01:10:53,588 --> 01:10:55,610
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, look at Silent Hill with the smoke babies.

851
01:10:55,790 --> 01:10:58,533
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, yes, you need to kill them because they're not human.

852
01:10:59,754 --> 01:11:00,855
[SPEAKER_03]: They're trying to eat you.

853
01:11:02,016 --> 01:11:02,537
[SPEAKER_03]: Or something.

854
01:11:02,857 --> 01:11:03,678
[SPEAKER_10]: Cats aren't human.

855
01:11:03,698 --> 01:11:04,338
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you kill them?

856
01:11:05,279 --> 01:11:06,620
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I don't kill them.

857
01:11:06,861 --> 01:11:08,402
[SPEAKER_03]: But they're not demon babies either.

858
01:11:09,964 --> 01:11:12,006
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, sometimes they are, but most of the time they're not.

859
01:11:12,958 --> 01:11:25,465
[SPEAKER_08]: a comment from xlink in chat chat.orange.radio.com they say no to this but you can shoot kids in Fallout 3 hmm those kids had it coming shut up

860
01:11:26,792 --> 01:11:31,876
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, speaking of things I told you were coming before too long on a completely different note.

861
01:11:32,257 --> 01:11:35,339
[SPEAKER_08]: Remember when I said don't discount Facebook gaming?

862
01:11:35,359 --> 01:11:36,160
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh-oh.

863
01:11:36,340 --> 01:11:36,981
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't discount.

864
01:11:37,001 --> 01:11:39,243
[SPEAKER_08]: There is a big, big new game coming to Facebook.

865
01:11:39,703 --> 01:11:42,505
[SPEAKER_08]: Civilization Network has been announced for Facebook.

866
01:11:42,525 --> 01:11:46,429
[SPEAKER_08]: And in my opinion, this is huge because this is what it sounds like.

867
01:11:46,469 --> 01:11:51,293
[SPEAKER_08]: It is a major PC beloved franchise colliding with the world of Facebook games.

868
01:11:51,593 --> 01:11:55,254
[SPEAKER_08]: and some of you are preparing your block application thing on Facebook right now.

869
01:11:55,294 --> 01:11:57,095
[SPEAKER_08]: Which, by the way, tangent warning.

870
01:11:57,895 --> 01:11:59,715
[SPEAKER_08]: What the hell is up with those changes on Facebook?

871
01:12:00,996 --> 01:12:01,776
[SPEAKER_08]: What changes?

872
01:12:02,136 --> 01:12:09,298
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, now they've changed it so when you log in you get like a news feed that seems to be like a random sampling of the stuff that you would see before.

873
01:12:09,618 --> 01:12:11,018
[SPEAKER_08]: Like the popular stories.

874
01:12:11,598 --> 01:12:13,739
[SPEAKER_08]: If you want to see the live feed you have to click into that.

875
01:12:13,799 --> 01:12:20,661
[SPEAKER_08]: But now the live feed shows not just people's updates but like who became friends with who and all this stuff that you really don't want to see.

876
01:12:21,454 --> 01:12:22,455
[SPEAKER_10]: All the stuff we don't care about.

877
01:12:23,036 --> 01:12:24,417
[SPEAKER_08]: Yay, more stuff we get to block.

878
01:12:25,118 --> 01:12:25,799
[SPEAKER_08]: You can't block it.

879
01:12:25,939 --> 01:12:28,422
[SPEAKER_08]: Because if you block it, then you block the person that did the friending.

880
01:12:29,403 --> 01:12:32,886
[SPEAKER_08]: So yeah, Facebook didn't think that one through very well.

881
01:12:33,346 --> 01:12:34,887
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyhow, sorry, I digress.

882
01:12:35,428 --> 01:12:39,110
[SPEAKER_08]: Civilization Network is making its way to Facebook and it's supposed to be out sometime in 2010.

883
01:12:39,811 --> 01:12:42,613
[SPEAKER_08]: There's actually a Facebook page already set up.

884
01:12:43,393 --> 01:12:47,436
[SPEAKER_08]: It's on facebook.com slash civnetwork, C-I-V network.

885
01:12:47,997 --> 01:12:51,079
[SPEAKER_08]: And they're going to be on the lookout for beta testers very soon.

886
01:12:51,640 --> 01:12:55,903
[SPEAKER_08]: Sid Meier himself has said that the game will offer everything that people love about Civ...

887
01:12:56,443 --> 01:12:59,226
[SPEAKER_08]: in a quote, fully persistent environment.

888
01:12:59,627 --> 01:13:02,790
[SPEAKER_08]: Best of all, the game will be free.

889
01:13:04,172 --> 01:13:04,712
[SPEAKER_08]: I like free.

890
01:13:04,993 --> 01:13:14,183
[SPEAKER_08]: Brian Reynolds, who is behind Civilization 2 and Alpha Centauri, has the job of chief designer at the social gaming developer site Zynga.

891
01:13:14,223 --> 01:13:15,825
[SPEAKER_08]: It's kind of an interesting little coincidence.

892
01:13:15,865 --> 01:13:17,246
[SPEAKER_08]: He has nothing to do with this game, but...

893
01:13:18,669 --> 01:13:32,958
[SPEAKER_08]: it's interesting that he did so much with that now he's at this other company so you think maybe old friends maybe got together at dinner talking about this who knows but Facebook gaming dude it's common this is going to be something we're going to see in the next few months just get bigger and bigger

894
01:13:34,860 --> 01:13:38,442
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, now we're going to get into a section of the show that we like to get into every week.

895
01:13:38,502 --> 01:13:44,087
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a section for DarkSakura to open up the gaming vault and take a travel through gaming's past.

896
01:13:44,107 --> 01:13:47,409
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a segment we call the Classic Game of the Week.

897
01:13:47,850 --> 01:13:50,572
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, what video game do you think the kids should be playing this week?

898
01:13:52,043 --> 01:13:54,484
[SPEAKER_10]: For those in the U.S., it is Galactic Attack.

899
01:13:56,624 --> 01:13:58,125
[SPEAKER_10]: It has been known by many other names.

900
01:14:01,285 --> 01:14:08,107
[SPEAKER_10]: In Japan, in the arcade, it was called Rayforce, but because of licensing, it came out as Layer Section on the Saturn.

901
01:14:08,567 --> 01:14:11,908
[SPEAKER_10]: We got it as Galactic Attack, and in Europe, they got it as Gunlock.

902
01:14:12,468 --> 01:14:17,909
[SPEAKER_10]: But it is in the Ray series, Rayforce, Raystorm, and Raycrisis.

903
01:14:19,530 --> 01:14:21,391
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's pretty freaking amazing shooting game.

904
01:14:23,493 --> 01:14:35,423
[SPEAKER_10]: I love the way that it plays because not only do you have the stuff coming from you from right above, you also target below your ship and can launch missiles at targets in the background.

905
01:14:36,384 --> 01:14:38,005
[SPEAKER_10]: Or as it should be, toward the bottom.

906
01:14:38,666 --> 01:14:40,207
[SPEAKER_10]: Can I add something to that?

907
01:14:40,868 --> 01:14:41,048
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

908
01:14:41,868 --> 01:14:44,571
[SPEAKER_08]: Unless you want to hear some of the lovely little shooting sound effects here.

909
01:14:44,711 --> 01:14:45,151
[SPEAKER_10]: Sure, why not?

910
01:14:45,231 --> 01:14:45,712
[SPEAKER_10]: The music's good.

911
01:14:51,209 --> 01:14:52,431
[SPEAKER_08]: Definitely sounds like a shooting game.

912
01:14:52,451 --> 01:14:53,974
[SPEAKER_08]: Just bullets, bullets, and more bullets.

913
01:14:55,092 --> 01:14:55,892
[SPEAKER_10]: It really is.

914
01:14:56,072 --> 01:15:02,193
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, it is just one of the, you know, regular old, you know, shooting games.

915
01:15:02,833 --> 01:15:04,634
[SPEAKER_10]: But I think it's one of Taito's best.

916
01:15:04,754 --> 01:15:07,334
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, especially, I love the entire series.

917
01:15:07,474 --> 01:15:12,135
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, Raystorm and Ray Crisis were fantastic.

918
01:15:12,335 --> 01:15:15,596
[SPEAKER_10]: But this, to me, I think is what really gave it to us.

919
01:15:16,236 --> 01:15:22,277
[SPEAKER_10]: It's, to this day, one of my favorite shooters and one of the reasons to have a rotating widescreen monitor.

920
01:15:24,656 --> 01:15:24,976
[SPEAKER_10]: That's it.

921
01:15:25,597 --> 01:15:25,897
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

922
01:15:26,598 --> 01:15:28,659
[SPEAKER_08]: So there it is, your classic game of the week.

923
01:15:28,939 --> 01:15:30,481
[SPEAKER_08]: It goes by several different names, right?

924
01:15:30,501 --> 01:15:31,942
[SPEAKER_08]: We have Galactic Attack in the U.S.

925
01:15:32,262 --> 01:15:32,542
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh-huh.

926
01:15:32,582 --> 01:15:33,443
[SPEAKER_10]: Gunlock in Europe.

927
01:15:33,743 --> 01:15:34,364
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh-huh.

928
01:15:34,544 --> 01:15:37,286
[SPEAKER_10]: Layer Section for the Japanese home version.

929
01:15:37,867 --> 01:15:40,789
[SPEAKER_10]: And in the arcade, it was Ray Force.

930
01:15:40,829 --> 01:15:41,970
[SPEAKER_08]: Why couldn't they just pick one name?

931
01:15:42,310 --> 01:15:43,311
[SPEAKER_10]: Because of licensing.

932
01:15:45,193 --> 01:15:46,714
[SPEAKER_10]: It was fully licensing.

933
01:15:47,452 --> 01:15:49,274
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, well there you have it, your classic game of the week.

934
01:15:49,995 --> 01:15:51,557
[SPEAKER_08]: Many, many different names for that one.

935
01:15:51,997 --> 01:15:53,739
[SPEAKER_08]: Check it out on the Sega Saturn.

936
01:15:54,460 --> 01:15:55,822
[SPEAKER_08]: Jamie loves her Sega games.

937
01:15:56,082 --> 01:15:56,623
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, she does.

938
01:15:57,785 --> 01:15:58,205
[SPEAKER_10]: I sure do.

939
01:15:58,425 --> 01:15:58,685
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright.

940
01:15:59,065 --> 01:16:02,046
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, that's going to do it for this Part A of our podcast, but don't go anywhere.

941
01:16:02,086 --> 01:16:06,427
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to be right back with plenty more in Part B. We have a lot coming up on deck in Part B tonight.

942
01:16:06,467 --> 01:16:17,910
[SPEAKER_08]: Not only do we have some news, some quick little stories here about what's coming out on Rock Band and Xbox Live and some news on Star Trek Online and Beatles Rock Band and so forth, but we have an interview coming up.

943
01:16:18,490 --> 01:16:24,212
[SPEAKER_08]: Our pal Seg is the man behind a charity event coming up in the Bay Area very soon known as Umlaut.

944
01:16:24,872 --> 01:16:27,695
[SPEAKER_08]: And we're going to be talking to him about what's going to go down in December.

945
01:16:27,895 --> 01:16:29,817
[SPEAKER_08]: Just a few weeks away, if you can believe it.

946
01:16:29,837 --> 01:16:30,678
[SPEAKER_08]: The year's almost up.

947
01:16:31,018 --> 01:16:32,300
[SPEAKER_08]: But it's all for a great cause.

948
01:16:32,320 --> 01:16:34,742
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to talk to Seg all about it right after this quick break.

949
01:16:35,083 --> 01:16:35,763
[SPEAKER_08]: So don't go anywhere.

950
01:16:35,784 --> 01:16:38,667
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll be right back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

951
01:16:45,021 --> 01:16:57,470
[SPEAKER_08]: And welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio here on this lovely Sunday evening, October the 25th of 2009, where we are taping the 342nd episode of our podcast, if you can believe it.

952
01:16:57,970 --> 01:17:09,618
[SPEAKER_08]: And of course you can tune in every week and listen to us tape live at www.allgamesradio.com, or if you just want the radio feed, it's allgamesradio.com, that's how I usually go in there.

953
01:17:10,038 --> 01:17:14,382
[SPEAKER_08]: or there's also a radio app that you can get on your iPhone if you just search for All Games in the Store.

954
01:17:14,442 --> 01:17:19,165
[SPEAKER_08]: They are the folks who we steal our bandwidth from every week and we really, really appreciate it.

955
01:17:19,646 --> 01:17:22,308
[SPEAKER_08]: So anyway, we're going to move into something a little different here.

956
01:17:22,328 --> 01:17:30,434
[SPEAKER_08]: We usually be doing Twitter topics about now, but we're actually going to invite a friend of the program on the show and he goes by Seg Online, but his name is John Segerson.

957
01:17:30,474 --> 01:17:37,440
[SPEAKER_08]: He actually goes by the nickname Seg and he is one of the minds behind Umlaut, which is a charity event that is happening in San Francisco at the DNA Lounge in

958
01:17:37,780 --> 01:17:41,761
[SPEAKER_08]: Wednesday, December 9th of this year, 7pm to 2am.

959
01:17:41,821 --> 01:17:45,802
[SPEAKER_08]: It is a rock band event for Child's Play Charity.

960
01:17:45,842 --> 01:17:49,463
[SPEAKER_08]: We like to talk about charity events and gamers doing good things.

961
01:17:49,523 --> 01:17:54,644
[SPEAKER_08]: So we're going to give Seg a call and get him on the show to talk to us a little bit about Umlaut.

962
01:17:55,444 --> 01:18:00,425
[SPEAKER_08]: So we're going to go ahead and ring him up on Skype right now and see what happens.

963
01:18:01,788 --> 01:18:02,568
[SPEAKER_01]: Orange Lounge Radio

964
01:18:31,457 --> 01:18:34,979
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an umlaut, but louder.

965
01:18:36,720 --> 01:18:45,024
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a charity event for Child's Play charity, which provides video games, toys, and other financial support to children's hospitals around the globe.

966
01:18:45,864 --> 01:18:55,129
[SPEAKER_01]: And our event is we play rock band as a catalyst for people donating money to Child's Play.

967
01:18:56,277 --> 01:19:01,860
[SPEAKER_08]: But now, is Rock Band the only thing that's going on at this event, or is this kind of like just a big party where Rock Band's kind of in the corner?

968
01:19:02,140 --> 01:19:02,680
[SPEAKER_08]: How's this work?

969
01:19:03,120 --> 01:19:11,484
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, actually, this is going to be a very different kind of Rock Band night than most Rock Band nights.

970
01:19:11,524 --> 01:19:20,369
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, usually when people go out to do Rock Band at a bar or something, it's there, but it's just everyone playing to a projector and all that.

971
01:19:21,189 --> 01:19:24,011
[SPEAKER_01]: We're doing something a little bit more.

972
01:19:25,252 --> 01:19:31,956
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll have one area of just regular rock band play, no fuss or anything, in the upstairs lounge area.

973
01:19:32,477 --> 01:19:41,383
[SPEAKER_01]: But for the main event, you're playing rock band on the DNA Lounge stage, a San Francisco concert venue.

974
01:19:41,983 --> 01:19:47,087
[SPEAKER_01]: And you will be performing rock band as a band on a concert stage to an audience.

975
01:19:47,147 --> 01:19:48,288
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's more than just...

976
01:19:49,528 --> 01:19:52,229
[SPEAKER_01]: Just playing rock band to the projector and all that.

977
01:19:52,509 --> 01:19:57,771
[SPEAKER_01]: You are putting on a rock concert for people.

978
01:19:58,772 --> 01:20:10,716
[SPEAKER_01]: And depending on what kind of band package you donate to, you can really get the ultimate rock concert performance experience with the lighting, band introduction, the whole nine yards.

979
01:20:11,107 --> 01:20:24,280
[SPEAKER_08]: Tell us a little more about some of these different experiences that rock band wannabes, or however you want to phrase it, because you talk about how you can actually get up on a real stage that quote-unquote real bands have performed up on.

980
01:20:24,320 --> 01:20:28,645
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that something that's accessible to everybody, or what are the different options for my band to showcase at this event?

981
01:20:29,184 --> 01:20:43,609
[SPEAKER_01]: so first of all I do want to say that we do have two stages and one stage is free for anybody to show up and we'll get in a little later of what everybody can do but if you and three of your friends

982
01:20:44,669 --> 01:20:51,053
[SPEAKER_01]: really want to perform on the main stage, we have two packages to perform on the main stage.

983
01:20:51,113 --> 01:20:59,378
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a standard band package, which we're going to ask for a $40 donation, but if you order online, it's $35.

984
01:21:00,238 --> 01:21:01,299
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the whole band.

985
01:21:01,459 --> 01:21:04,721
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you split that up to four people, that's $8.75 a person.

986
01:21:07,063 --> 01:21:09,985
[SPEAKER_01]: And for the standard band package, you get to play on the stage.

987
01:21:10,726 --> 01:21:15,610
[SPEAKER_01]: You just play on the stage regularly, but you're still playing to the crowd on a major San Francisco stage.

988
01:21:16,110 --> 01:21:21,055
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, if you want to rock harder, that's where our ultimate band package comes in.

989
01:21:21,155 --> 01:21:23,377
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to put some extra oomph in your oomph loud.

990
01:21:24,017 --> 01:21:24,758
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.

991
01:21:25,638 --> 01:21:31,904
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're asking for $120 for the donation, but again, that's the band package, so it amounts to $30.

992
01:21:31,944 --> 01:21:32,284
[SPEAKER_01]: And you get...

993
01:21:33,385 --> 01:21:34,905
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for watching!

994
01:21:54,404 --> 01:21:57,887
[SPEAKER_01]: Every song on Rock Band available.

995
01:21:58,487 --> 01:22:07,134
[SPEAKER_01]: We actually partnered up with Harmonix with this and they will be providing stuff that can be played on Rock Band 2, but all of it.

996
01:22:07,194 --> 01:22:13,399
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's those few songs on Rock Band 1 that won't be included.

997
01:22:14,060 --> 01:22:19,664
[SPEAKER_01]: And Beatles doesn't count for the main stage because it's just hard to get people through without switching discs.

998
01:22:19,744 --> 01:22:21,125
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, you don't want to have to switch discs all the time.

999
01:22:21,445 --> 01:22:23,606
[SPEAKER_08]: Is it still like, what, a thousand songs to pick from?

1000
01:22:23,626 --> 01:22:25,507
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it's about a thousand songs.

1001
01:22:26,067 --> 01:22:33,370
[SPEAKER_01]: So we feel we're comfortable in doing this because it'd be pretty lame to have the same song played again.

1002
01:22:34,071 --> 01:22:37,152
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're in the ultimate band package, you get to reserve it ahead of time.

1003
01:22:38,613 --> 01:22:39,593
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's one thing.

1004
01:22:40,654 --> 01:22:47,557
[SPEAKER_01]: You also get, each member of your band will get lanyards, that sort of VIP pass thing.

1005
01:22:48,677 --> 01:23:17,663
[SPEAKER_01]: that's a nice little take home memento you also get you'll get a gift bag for each band member four bags and when you're about to go on stage you'll be introduced as your band you have to pick a name for your band and we'll make an introduction for you and we get the lighting guy involved and it just really makes it the kind of experience you really can't really can't get anywhere with it did you get the rock band Fog Machine?

1006
01:23:18,303 --> 01:23:19,705
[SPEAKER_01]: Who needs the fog machine?

1007
01:23:19,745 --> 01:23:25,912
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll have the full lighting setup of the DNA Lounge's concert venue stage.

1008
01:23:26,112 --> 01:23:26,833
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess true enough.

1009
01:23:26,873 --> 01:23:29,055
[SPEAKER_08]: You get industrial strength.

1010
01:23:29,556 --> 01:23:31,899
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, you get the industrial strength concert.

1011
01:23:32,179 --> 01:23:33,000
[SPEAKER_08]: Fair enough, fair enough.

1012
01:23:33,280 --> 01:23:45,771
[SPEAKER_08]: And for those folks that are thinking, oh my gosh, $120, that's a lot of money, keep in mind, this is, you know, A, a once-in-a-never type experience that you can get getting to play on the stage, and B, the fact that it's going to charity.

1013
01:23:45,911 --> 01:23:49,054
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, it's not like going in SAG's pocket, it's going to a great charity.

1014
01:23:49,514 --> 01:23:51,214
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, it's going to Child's Play.

1015
01:23:51,795 --> 01:23:59,737
[SPEAKER_01]: We really want to stress that this is a donation, and the money that you give is going to Child's Play.

1016
01:24:03,478 --> 01:24:12,300
[SPEAKER_01]: If you stood back and just saw it as the value of just like, what would I pay just to play rock band, you're kind of thinking it a little wrong in this context.

1017
01:24:12,660 --> 01:24:17,081
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a donation to which we are thanking you by giving you this experience.

1018
01:24:17,403 --> 01:24:18,204
[SPEAKER_08]: All ages show at DNA Lounge

1019
01:24:42,162 --> 01:24:42,742
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1020
01:25:09,477 --> 01:25:15,023
[SPEAKER_01]: We are asking for a $10 donation because this is a charity event.

1021
01:25:16,084 --> 01:25:17,365
[SPEAKER_01]: But no one will be turned away.

1022
01:25:17,845 --> 01:25:23,411
[SPEAKER_01]: And even if you don't do the donation, you will get two raffle tickets for our prize raffle.

1023
01:25:23,972 --> 01:25:27,235
[SPEAKER_01]: And our prize raffle is stuff that we've been...

1024
01:25:29,657 --> 01:25:44,588
[SPEAKER_01]: my cohorts Chris Kohler, Joe Marquette have been collecting throughout the year of all this swag and all this stuff and they've been piling up in their apartments and we're going to give this stuff away as prizes in this free raffle

1025
01:25:45,629 --> 01:26:04,797
[SPEAKER_01]: so there's a lot of incentive there and actually Chris is doing a prize a day on our blog at umloud.org that's U-M-L-O-U-D dot org where he'll take a photo of some of the things that he'll have and post it so you can see the kinds of things that we'll be giving away on that night

1026
01:26:05,734 --> 01:26:10,496
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, I know this is an event that's being hosted at the DNA Lounge, which is on 11th Street in San Francisco.

1027
01:26:10,536 --> 01:26:12,776
[SPEAKER_08]: And again, the date and time, if you missed it, December 9th, 2009.

1028
01:26:13,496 --> 01:26:15,217
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a Wednesday, 7 p.m.

1029
01:26:15,297 --> 01:26:16,097
[SPEAKER_08]: till 2 a.m.

1030
01:26:16,157 --> 01:26:17,438
[SPEAKER_08]: Like most bars are open till 2 a.m.

1031
01:26:18,238 --> 01:26:21,059
[SPEAKER_08]: But what if we have listeners all over the globe, really?

1032
01:26:21,159 --> 01:26:24,640
[SPEAKER_08]: How can people help out if they can't be there in San Francisco on that night?

1033
01:26:25,945 --> 01:26:40,292
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, I know our event is around San Francisco and all that, but if you can't make it to San Francisco or any of the other kinds of events that are happening, please consider a donation to Child's Play Charity.

1034
01:26:40,872 --> 01:26:48,096
[SPEAKER_01]: Just go directly to them, they're childsplaycharity.org, and just consider a donation direct to them.

1035
01:26:48,576 --> 01:26:55,641
[SPEAKER_01]: We're doing this thing here in San Francisco because of the success of Foombrowser last year, and a lot of people liked it.

1036
01:26:55,701 --> 01:27:01,606
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's the kind of thing that we know that a lot of people come to, and we want to facilitate that.

1037
01:27:02,046 --> 01:27:09,832
[SPEAKER_01]: But what we're really here is to create awareness to Child's Play Charity as a whole.

1038
01:27:10,212 --> 01:27:17,658
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is one microchasm of the many things going on in the gaming community to help Child's Play Charity.

1039
01:27:18,373 --> 01:27:20,635
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I think it's a great cause and it's a really fun event.

1040
01:27:20,735 --> 01:27:29,201
[SPEAKER_08]: And, you know, if nothing else, even if people are like shy, you know, one thing that should be said is that this isn't just, you know, for people that love attention of getting up on stage and all that.

1041
01:27:29,241 --> 01:27:37,707
[SPEAKER_08]: If you just kind of want to come hang with, you know, cool people, come to this event because I'm going to be there and I believe DarkSakura is going to be there and we're trying to get Loki there.

1042
01:27:38,008 --> 01:27:39,068
[SPEAKER_08]: So hopefully we'll all be there.

1043
01:27:39,108 --> 01:27:39,789
[SPEAKER_08]: So come hang with us.

1044
01:27:40,117 --> 01:27:41,338
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, and we'll definitely have more.

1045
01:27:41,398 --> 01:27:43,519
[SPEAKER_01]: There's stuff that we're working on.

1046
01:27:43,579 --> 01:27:53,546
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't really say right now, but don't feel that just because you didn't get the band package thing that there's nothing for you.

1047
01:27:53,886 --> 01:27:56,108
[SPEAKER_01]: There will be plenty of things for you to do.

1048
01:27:56,148 --> 01:27:58,369
[SPEAKER_01]: You will have a good time just showing up.

1049
01:27:58,469 --> 01:28:00,711
[SPEAKER_01]: So please, please come by.

1050
01:28:01,471 --> 01:28:02,492
[SPEAKER_01]: We'd love to have you.

1051
01:28:03,773 --> 01:28:07,499
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, again, for all the information of this, there are many, many other things.

1052
01:28:07,879 --> 01:28:10,623
[SPEAKER_01]: Please come to our website, umloud.org.

1053
01:28:10,723 --> 01:28:13,327
[SPEAKER_01]: That's U-M-L-O-U-D dot org.

1054
01:28:14,148 --> 01:28:15,090
[SPEAKER_01]: And we hope to see you there.

1055
01:28:15,743 --> 01:28:17,084
[SPEAKER_08]: And I just wanted to mention this real quick.

1056
01:28:17,124 --> 01:28:23,807
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm kind of glancing through chat here and I see Tigerclaw in chat says something about DNA Lounge seems to have like a live video stream.

1057
01:28:24,508 --> 01:28:25,328
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yes, that's right.

1058
01:28:25,368 --> 01:28:30,551
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, there will be a live video stream that will be turned on during our events.

1059
01:28:30,651 --> 01:28:35,774
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can also see us rock out all the bands.

1060
01:28:36,094 --> 01:28:40,056
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be centered on the main stage, I believe.

1061
01:28:40,636 --> 01:28:44,018
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can view it from anywhere during the night as well.

1062
01:28:44,517 --> 01:28:45,978
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft

1063
01:29:06,044 --> 01:29:08,625
[SPEAKER_01]: Get on the boat soon to do the band packages.

1064
01:29:08,906 --> 01:29:17,090
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll have a few of the standard on hand, but that's sort of our release valve to make sure that everyone who's paid for a package gets to play on the stage.

1065
01:29:17,170 --> 01:29:22,673
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're also increasing the price a little more on the night of for the standard package.

1066
01:29:23,114 --> 01:29:32,319
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you really want to do that, if you really want to do this, please order soon than later.

1067
01:29:33,183 --> 01:29:33,503
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1068
01:29:33,924 --> 01:29:39,028
[SPEAKER_08]: So once again, this is Umlaut happening Wednesday, December 9th of this year, 7 p.m.

1069
01:29:39,048 --> 01:29:39,708
[SPEAKER_08]: to 2 a.m.

1070
01:29:39,748 --> 01:29:42,590
[SPEAKER_08]: at the DNA Lounge on 11th Street in San Francisco.

1071
01:29:42,991 --> 01:29:45,913
[SPEAKER_08]: More information is available on their website, umlaut.org.

1072
01:29:45,953 --> 01:29:48,395
[SPEAKER_08]: That's U-M-L-O-U-D.org.

1073
01:29:48,755 --> 01:29:51,998
[SPEAKER_08]: And you guys are on the Twitter and the Facebook and all those fun spots too, right?

1074
01:29:52,458 --> 01:30:00,942
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, it's amazing how many things can and cannot use the umlauted U. And that's so important for an event like this.

1075
01:30:00,962 --> 01:30:01,703
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so important.

1076
01:30:01,723 --> 01:30:02,163
[SPEAKER_08]: It is.

1077
01:30:02,483 --> 01:30:05,625
[SPEAKER_08]: But don't worry, you don't have to figure out how to type it into your computer to get to the website.

1078
01:30:05,665 --> 01:30:07,245
[SPEAKER_08]: Just a normal U will do just fine.

1079
01:30:07,265 --> 01:30:08,486
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, a normal U will work.

1080
01:30:08,746 --> 01:30:09,406
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, there you go.

1081
01:30:09,746 --> 01:30:10,907
[SPEAKER_08]: Seg, thank you so much.

1082
01:30:11,127 --> 01:30:12,347
[SPEAKER_08]: Best of luck with the event.

1083
01:30:12,367 --> 01:30:13,127
[SPEAKER_01]: No, thank you guys.

1084
01:30:13,548 --> 01:30:17,569
[SPEAKER_01]: We had to rebrand this event a week and a half ago.

1085
01:30:18,869 --> 01:30:24,851
[SPEAKER_01]: So we really appreciate any word coming out of this event since it's a new name and everything.

1086
01:30:25,532 --> 01:30:29,533
[SPEAKER_01]: And we will have a great event for you guys to come.

1087
01:30:30,143 --> 01:30:30,844
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, awesome.

1088
01:30:30,864 --> 01:30:34,126
[SPEAKER_08]: And hey, yeah, listeners, definitely follow these guys on Facebook or Twitter.

1089
01:30:34,206 --> 01:30:43,933
[SPEAKER_08]: Even if you're not in San Francisco, you might have a friend or relative or someone who likes video games that might see you following this and check it out.

1090
01:30:44,033 --> 01:30:47,476
[SPEAKER_08]: Get the word out about Umlaut and a great event for Child's Play Charity.

1091

[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, Seg, thank you so much.

[SPEAKER_08]: We'll see if I can make it down there.

1098
01:31:16,543 --> 01:31:17,243
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, all right.

1099
01:31:17,283 --> 01:31:21,866
[SPEAKER_08]: At least we got upgraded from I don't know to a we'll see, so that's usually good.

1100
01:31:22,246 --> 01:31:22,506
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1101
01:31:22,886 --> 01:31:25,367
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyhow, we'll get to more Skype calls a little later on in the show.

1102
01:31:25,688 --> 01:31:28,469
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to thank our buddy, Seg, for tuning in live and being here with us live.

1103
01:31:28,769 --> 01:31:36,393
[SPEAKER_08]: We've got plenty more show for you, including some rapid-fire news, and I believe right into a story about Rock Band and maybe some more songs you can play at this event.

1104
01:31:36,513 --> 01:31:37,134
[SPEAKER_03]: Rob Zombie, Pac-1

1105
01:31:54,955 --> 01:31:57,877
[SPEAKER_03]: Which I gotta say has got some sweet songs in it.

1106
01:31:58,017 --> 01:31:59,758
[SPEAKER_03]: Definitely something I'm going to be purchasing.

1107
01:32:00,419 --> 01:32:03,200
[SPEAKER_03]: Including Burn, Dragula, and Super Beast.

1108
01:32:03,321 --> 01:32:05,262
[SPEAKER_03]: It's about frickin' time Dragula's in the game.

1109
01:32:05,322 --> 01:32:06,623
[SPEAKER_08]: Hell yes.

1110
01:32:07,823 --> 01:32:08,844
[SPEAKER_08]: What song are we going to sing?

1111
01:32:08,924 --> 01:32:10,505
[SPEAKER_08]: That would be a perfect song.

1112
01:32:10,525 --> 01:32:11,366
[SPEAKER_08]: You want to do Dragula?

1113
01:32:11,806 --> 01:32:13,727
[SPEAKER_08]: I can get up on there and do my best Rob Zombie.

1114
01:32:14,128 --> 01:32:16,589
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll have to get a big curly wig or something.

1115
01:32:16,609 --> 01:32:17,490
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll figure something out.

1116
01:32:18,972 --> 01:32:25,636
[SPEAKER_03]: Wolfmother Pack 1 New Moon Rising, Pilgrim, Sundial, White Unicorn, Woman Liz Fair, Rock Me, Morning Wood, Best of Me, Sugar Baby

1117
01:32:40,939 --> 01:32:41,880
[SPEAKER_03]: and each of those are available.

1118
01:32:42,200 --> 01:32:46,942
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually the Morning Wood tracks are half off so it's only a buck or 80 Microsoft points.

1119
01:32:47,903 --> 01:32:52,305
[SPEAKER_03]: Everything else individually is $1.99 or 200 Wii points or 160 Microsoft points and of course the packs are a little bit cheaper.

1120
01:32:52,325 --> 01:32:53,766
[SPEAKER_03]: The Rob Zombie pack is $5.49 or 440 Microsoft points.

1121
01:32:53,786 --> 01:32:56,267
[SPEAKER_03]: $6.80 Microsoft points for the Wolf Mother pack or $8.49 in real money.

1122
01:33:07,733 --> 01:33:09,394
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, of course, the PSP.

1123
01:33:10,134 --> 01:33:14,496
[SPEAKER_03]: They're getting Sonic Youth, Cool Thing, and Steely Dan, My Old School.

1124
01:33:14,836 --> 01:33:15,436
[SPEAKER_03]: Both of those for $2.

1125
01:33:17,957 --> 01:33:30,703
[SPEAKER_03]: And then to go along with releases here, Konami has confirmed that they're going to be releasing a port of Shadow of Destiny, which came out, I believe, on PlayStation 2 not too long ago.

1126
01:33:31,483 --> 01:33:32,123
[SPEAKER_03]: And, yeah.

1127
01:33:33,804 --> 01:33:33,964
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1128
01:33:34,341 --> 01:33:37,222
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember it being a pretty decent game when it came out on PlayStation 2.

1129
01:33:54,997 --> 01:33:59,179
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, well speaking of release dates, it's not very often we're talking about a game coming out early.

1130
01:33:59,239 --> 01:34:02,301
[SPEAKER_08]: In fact, this year it's been talking about all these games getting delayed to 2010.

1131
01:34:02,941 --> 01:34:09,344
[SPEAKER_08]: But Need for Speed Nitro, that's the new Need for Speed entry on the Nintendo Wii and DS, has had its release bumped up.

1132
01:34:09,745 --> 01:34:12,126
[SPEAKER_08]: It was originally going to come out November 17th, but guess what?

1133
01:34:12,206 --> 01:34:16,668
[SPEAKER_08]: It's now coming out November 3rd here in the US and November 6th over in Europe.

1134
01:34:16,748 --> 01:34:18,709
[SPEAKER_08]: So it actually got out a little early.

1135
01:34:19,089 --> 01:34:20,550
[SPEAKER_08]: I actually checked this out at E3.

1136
01:34:20,670 --> 01:34:22,071
[SPEAKER_08]: Pretty cool for a Wii game.

1137
01:34:22,471 --> 01:34:24,192
[SPEAKER_08]: I know that sounds kind of harsh, but

1138
01:34:24,392 --> 01:34:24,993
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks for watching!

1139
01:34:40,565 --> 01:34:45,068
[SPEAKER_08]: On Xbox Live, Rainbow Islands Towering Adventure is coming out on Xbox Live.

1140
01:34:45,388 --> 01:34:50,172
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, that would be Rainbow Islands, that game that kind of was once inspired by Bubble Bobble.

1141
01:34:50,232 --> 01:34:52,013
[SPEAKER_08]: It was kind of like a sequel to Bubble Bobble.

1142
01:34:52,393 --> 01:34:53,054
[SPEAKER_08]: It was a little different.

1143
01:34:53,094 --> 01:34:55,255
[SPEAKER_08]: It was still Bub and Bob, but they were shooting rainbows.

1144
01:34:55,555 --> 01:34:58,317
[SPEAKER_08]: Although I noticed in the screenshots for this game, I don't see Bub and Bob.

1145
01:34:58,357 --> 01:34:59,438
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like a new little guy here.

1146
01:34:59,498 --> 01:35:01,079
[SPEAKER_08]: So this is some new little spin-off game.

1147
01:35:01,559 --> 01:35:03,180
[SPEAKER_08]: It's Rainbow Islands Towering Adventure.

1148
01:35:03,200 --> 01:35:06,443
[SPEAKER_08]: It is actually a port of a WiiWare game that came out a little while ago.

1149
01:35:07,283 --> 01:35:10,005
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's coming out very, very soon.

1150
01:35:11,445 --> 01:35:20,993
[SPEAKER_10]: Also for those who are in Europe and can make it and are interested, there's going to be playable Star Trek Online at Eurogamer Expo.

1151
01:35:22,034 --> 01:35:27,037
[SPEAKER_10]: They're almost out of tickets too, but that's on Wednesday the 28th in Leeds.

1152
01:35:27,898 --> 01:35:29,179
[SPEAKER_10]: And yeah, they're almost sold out.

1153
01:35:29,339 --> 01:35:35,984
[SPEAKER_10]: But you can actually play on one of the gaming PCs there and...

1154
01:35:38,681 --> 01:35:41,162
[SPEAKER_10]: It's different level demos.

1155
01:35:41,282 --> 01:35:43,883
[SPEAKER_10]: You can do ship-to-ship and planet combat.

1156
01:35:44,244 --> 01:35:47,805
[SPEAKER_10]: And you can shoot Klingons in space.

1157
01:35:48,706 --> 01:35:52,067
[SPEAKER_10]: You can actually, I think, play as Klingons in that one, too.

1158
01:35:52,968 --> 01:35:56,889
[SPEAKER_10]: And also, you can go visit the giant lopsided donut.

1159
01:35:57,050 --> 01:35:58,090
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, the Guardian of Forever.

1160
01:35:58,930 --> 01:35:59,951
[SPEAKER_10]: So, it should be fun.

1161
01:36:04,233 --> 01:36:04,413
[SPEAKER_08]: And...

1162
01:36:06,121 --> 01:36:06,721
[SPEAKER_10]: Bayonetta.

1163
01:36:07,621 --> 01:36:09,562
[SPEAKER_10]: Bayonetta has done something major.

1164
01:36:10,102 --> 01:36:13,803
[SPEAKER_10]: It is the first Xbox 360 game that got a perfect score from Famitsu.

1165
01:36:14,603 --> 01:36:15,983
[SPEAKER_10]: It got a perfect 40-40.

1166
01:36:16,923 --> 01:36:18,724
[SPEAKER_08]: Although now Bayonetta is cross-platform.

1167
01:36:18,764 --> 01:36:21,604
[SPEAKER_08]: It just happens that Xbox 360 is one of the platforms it's on, correct?

1168
01:36:21,624 --> 01:36:22,565
[SPEAKER_10]: And also the better version.

1169
01:36:23,385 --> 01:36:24,725
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, the other one got 38.

1170
01:36:25,645 --> 01:36:27,186
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, so they did review both.

1171
01:36:27,386 --> 01:36:28,006
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

1172
01:36:28,206 --> 01:36:29,626
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't know that Famitsu did that.

1173
01:36:29,706 --> 01:36:30,246
[SPEAKER_08]: Very interesting.

1174
01:36:30,446 --> 01:36:32,627
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, there are... If you actually...

1175
01:36:33,907 --> 01:36:36,868
[SPEAKER_10]: Look for movies on YouTube of them side by side.

1176
01:36:37,728 --> 01:36:39,429
[SPEAKER_10]: You will see a noticeable difference.

1177
01:36:39,469 --> 01:36:39,869
[SPEAKER_08]: Interesting.

1178
01:36:40,229 --> 01:36:45,931
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, Famitsu Magazine doesn't hand out 40s very often, although it seems like we've had a few of these stories in the past few years.

1179
01:36:46,491 --> 01:36:49,132
[SPEAKER_08]: Sometimes you kind of raise an eyebrow at the games they give 40s to.

1180
01:36:49,252 --> 01:36:51,753
[SPEAKER_08]: I believe Nintendogs was one of their 40 titles.

1181
01:36:52,093 --> 01:36:56,655
[SPEAKER_08]: But there's a lot of really, really great games in the past, like Final Fantasy XII and so forth, that got this as well.

1182
01:36:56,695 --> 01:36:57,735
[SPEAKER_08]: So it definitely is a distinction.

1183
01:36:57,755 --> 01:37:00,156
[SPEAKER_08]: I think only, what, a dozen games in the history of the magazine have had it?

1184
01:37:00,376 --> 01:37:00,816
[SPEAKER_10]: I think so.

1185
01:37:00,836 --> 01:37:01,797
[SPEAKER_10]: For me, it's really tough.

1186
01:37:01,957 --> 01:37:05,819
[SPEAKER_08]: So Bayonetta, getting that is a big like, whoa, whoa, hello.

1187
01:37:06,019 --> 01:37:07,240
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I'm totally getting Bayonetta.

1188
01:37:07,380 --> 01:37:09,321
[SPEAKER_08]: Any word on what it was they loved about the game?

1189
01:37:10,162 --> 01:37:12,203
[SPEAKER_08]: Or just we're only hearing about the 40s right now?

1190
01:37:12,743 --> 01:37:14,945
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it's just the 40s so far.

1191
01:37:15,025 --> 01:37:16,085
[SPEAKER_10]: Let me double check.

1192
01:37:17,366 --> 01:37:22,129
[SPEAKER_08]: Salacious Pop clarifies, by the way, they gave the PS3 version a 38 because the port is muddy and bad.

1193
01:37:22,469 --> 01:37:24,730
[SPEAKER_08]: It looks brown and is missing quite a bit of particles.

1194
01:37:25,031 --> 01:37:25,191
[SPEAKER_08]: Ouch.

1195
01:37:26,073 --> 01:37:31,296
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, they're not really saying why, but yeah, just seriously, look at them side by side.

1196
01:37:32,197 --> 01:37:32,937
[SPEAKER_03]: 38's still not bad.

1197
01:37:33,058 --> 01:37:34,058
[SPEAKER_03]: That's intense.

1198
01:37:34,298 --> 01:37:35,679
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, oh, it's crappy.

1199
01:37:35,839 --> 01:37:40,242
[SPEAKER_08]: I think President Cat got, what, like a 24 from Famitsu.

1200
01:37:40,282 --> 01:37:40,902
[SPEAKER_08]: That's harsh.

1201
01:37:40,922 --> 01:37:43,504
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, they're used to seeing these games a lot, too.

1202
01:37:43,564 --> 01:37:45,706
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's a lot different for them than it was for us.

1203
01:37:45,726 --> 01:37:47,987
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe like a generic party game coming out over here on the Wii.

1204
01:37:48,007 --> 01:37:52,570
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, those are a dime a dozen, whereas Cat games, there's two.

1205
01:37:53,795 --> 01:37:54,675
[SPEAKER_03]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1206
01:38:20,362 --> 01:38:31,031
[SPEAKER_03]: No word on what the hell this is going to be used for, possibly a design for their new remote, their motion controller device, sans ice cream, I guess.

1207
01:38:31,732 --> 01:38:36,796
[SPEAKER_03]: But it sort of looks like a sex toy, too, so I don't know.

1208
01:38:40,119 --> 01:38:40,920
[SPEAKER_08]: That sounds kind of gross.

1209
01:38:40,940 --> 01:38:41,961
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

1210
01:38:41,981 --> 01:38:42,181
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

1211
01:38:46,205 --> 01:38:49,486
[SPEAKER_08]: So this is not like these are actually coming out.

1212
01:38:49,566 --> 01:38:52,446
[SPEAKER_08]: This is just a list of this is what could have been or what is this?

1213
01:38:53,227 --> 01:38:54,007
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a design.

1214
01:38:54,267 --> 01:38:55,027
[SPEAKER_03]: They may go with it.

1215
01:38:55,067 --> 01:38:56,007
[SPEAKER_03]: They may not go with it.

1216
01:38:56,027 --> 01:38:59,468
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just like Nintendo with their inflatable chair of fun.

1217
01:39:00,249 --> 01:39:00,949
[SPEAKER_03]: It might come out.

1218
01:39:01,009 --> 01:39:01,469
[SPEAKER_03]: It might not.

1219
01:39:01,529 --> 01:39:02,309
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just an idea.

1220
01:39:02,389 --> 01:39:07,891
[SPEAKER_08]: I thought everything was sold on the whole lights thing or the changing light dot beam looking thing.

1221
01:39:08,351 --> 01:39:09,711
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, I thought that's what we were going at.

1222
01:39:09,911 --> 01:39:12,692
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, maybe they decided to change...

1223
01:39:13,325 --> 01:39:13,866
[SPEAKER_03]: The way they look.

1224
01:39:13,946 --> 01:39:17,951
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe there's a light on here that we don't see or something.

1225
01:39:18,011 --> 01:39:18,352
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

1226
01:39:18,892 --> 01:39:22,117
[SPEAKER_03]: To me, it looks like a plastic cylinder that has four buttons on top.

1227
01:39:24,340 --> 01:39:25,101
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, you know what, though?

1228
01:39:25,221 --> 01:39:25,421
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't...

1229
01:39:27,308 --> 01:39:32,229
[SPEAKER_08]: I have a lot of faith in Sony when it comes to controller design because I still love the PlayStation controllers.

1230
01:39:32,549 --> 01:39:36,750
[SPEAKER_08]: Although then again, I say that and then at the same time I think, yeah, but then they did take DualShock out of the PS3.

1231
01:39:36,970 --> 01:39:38,070
[SPEAKER_08]: But that was a whole different reason.

1232
01:39:38,090 --> 01:39:39,050
[SPEAKER_08]: That wasn't really a design thing.

1233
01:39:39,070 --> 01:39:40,930
[SPEAKER_08]: That was because they didn't want to pay royalties.

1234
01:39:41,230 --> 01:39:54,953
[SPEAKER_08]: But, you know, the PlayStation 3 controller is still a rock solid controller, especially, you know, and I took some crap last week for saying this, but especially compared to the 360 controller, which, you know, the D-pad leaves a lot to be desired on the 360 controller.

1235
01:39:54,973 --> 01:39:56,493
[SPEAKER_08]: The PS3 is a pretty slick controller.

1236
01:39:57,153 --> 01:39:58,013
[SPEAKER_08]: Especially the newer ones.

1237
01:39:58,333 --> 01:40:01,534
[SPEAKER_08]: So, you know, I kind of trust their judgment when it comes to making controllers.

1238
01:40:01,574 --> 01:40:05,175
[SPEAKER_08]: They usually don't make bad ones, except that boomerang thing was really weird.

1239
01:40:05,675 --> 01:40:06,935
[SPEAKER_08]: But that never did come out.

1240
01:40:06,955 --> 01:40:08,116
[SPEAKER_08]: That was only a concept thing.

1241
01:40:08,196 --> 01:40:11,577
[SPEAKER_08]: So, maybe that light thing went the way of the boomerang.

1242
01:40:11,597 --> 01:40:21,059
[SPEAKER_03]: Thankfully, we do live in the day and the age of the internet, because if this was like, you know, the mid-90s where all we had were gaming magazines, that boomerang would have come out.

1243
01:40:21,699 --> 01:40:22,179
[SPEAKER_03]: Possibly.

1244
01:40:22,199 --> 01:40:24,660
[SPEAKER_03]: Because they wouldn't have heard the horrible feedback.

1245
01:40:24,720 --> 01:40:25,300
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think...

1246
01:40:26,559 --> 01:40:26,939
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

1247
01:40:26,979 --> 01:40:29,100
[SPEAKER_08]: This is like a debate that's years old at this point.

1248
01:40:29,140 --> 01:40:31,520
[SPEAKER_08]: But I don't know if the boomerang was necessarily a bad thing.

1249
01:40:31,560 --> 01:40:32,960
[SPEAKER_08]: I'd have to feel it in my hands.

1250
01:40:33,380 --> 01:40:36,821
[SPEAKER_08]: If it felt fine to control with, I would have been okay with the weird design.

1251
01:40:37,741 --> 01:40:42,222
[SPEAKER_08]: But I just think at the same time, the PlayStation controllers are one of the best controllers ever.

1252
01:40:42,662 --> 01:40:44,343
[SPEAKER_08]: Why ruin a good thing?

1253
01:40:44,403 --> 01:40:46,403
[SPEAKER_08]: Look at the PS1, PS2, PS3 controllers.

1254
01:40:46,663 --> 01:40:49,604
[SPEAKER_08]: They've all been pretty much the same, and there's a reason for that.

1255
01:40:49,644 --> 01:40:52,785
[SPEAKER_08]: Granted, they added Rumble to it at some point along the way.

1256
01:40:52,825 --> 01:40:54,205
[SPEAKER_08]: They added DualShock and all that.

1257
01:40:55,933 --> 01:40:57,228
[SPEAKER_08]: Pretty much though it stayed consistent.

1258
01:41:00,631 --> 01:41:03,413
[SPEAKER_08]: Moving on to another news story having to do with Beatles Rock Band.

1259
01:41:03,613 --> 01:41:08,396
[SPEAKER_08]: Beatles Rock Band has actually beaten Guitar Hero 5 on the sales chart.

1260
01:41:08,676 --> 01:41:10,017
[SPEAKER_08]: This is based on U.S.

1261
01:41:10,357 --> 01:41:12,098
[SPEAKER_08]: September sales.

1262
01:41:12,138 --> 01:41:18,242
[SPEAKER_08]: Believe it or not, the Beatles was released September 9th and Guitar Hero 5 was released September 1st.

1263
01:41:18,282 --> 01:41:20,643
[SPEAKER_08]: The Beatles has moved 595,000 units to 499 units of Guitar Hero 5.

1264
01:41:20,703 --> 01:41:22,424
[SPEAKER_08]: Granted, that's really close

1265
01:41:27,327 --> 01:41:46,876
[SPEAKER_08]: but also it should be noted that the All You Need Is Love download track 100,000 downloads in September so this is only considering September it's not considering the important Christmas period I don't want to start all this like OMG Guitar Hero 5 got his butt kicked but it is a little surprising considering Beatles Rock Band to some was kind of a niche title

1266
01:41:47,176 --> 01:41:50,559
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think it is I'm not remotely surprised, I'm surprised it didn't sell more

1267
01:42:11,917 --> 01:42:14,439
[SPEAKER_08]: A lot of people are actually surprised the Beatles game didn't sell more.

1268
01:42:14,759 --> 01:42:17,541
[SPEAKER_08]: But of course, you know, this game will move throughout Christmas.

1269
01:42:18,181 --> 01:42:28,247
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, both of these games are still going to continue to move, but it is a very... I mean, doesn't Guitar Hero... I mean, just taking the whole Beatles thing out of it, doesn't Guitar Hero usually tend to beat Rock Band on sales chart?

1270
01:42:28,628 --> 01:42:31,129
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it depends who you're asking because...

1271
01:42:32,932 --> 01:43:02,681
[SPEAKER_03]: they say yeah we've sold more units well yeah you have like 5 times as many games coming out so yes you've sold more units so you can't really trust those numbers I mean look at even the Guitar Hero platform you've still got 2 more games coming out this year in Guitar Hero well Band Hero but come on it's Guitar Hero it's just E10 and then Van Halen that's still coming out too so it's a little oversaturation right now

1272
01:43:04,104 --> 01:43:04,885
[SPEAKER_08]: Enough already!

1273
01:43:29,707 --> 01:43:30,747
[SPEAKER_08]: It was actually pretty good.

1274
01:43:31,287 --> 01:43:31,947
[SPEAKER_08]: Did you go see it?

1275
01:43:31,987 --> 01:43:32,248
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

1276
01:43:32,468 --> 01:43:32,748
[SPEAKER_08]: Really?

1277
01:43:34,528 --> 01:43:36,968
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't like the last few because it's just hard to follow what's going on.

1278
01:43:37,009 --> 01:43:41,549
[SPEAKER_03]: But this one actually took place after the last movie in chronology, which is awesome.

1279
01:43:42,070 --> 01:43:44,590
[SPEAKER_03]: And they kind of explained a lot of things and I thought it was actually pretty decent.

1280
01:43:46,490 --> 01:43:47,851
[SPEAKER_08]: But do you know what it got beat by?

1281
01:43:47,911 --> 01:43:49,491
[SPEAKER_10]: Did it explain why people like it?

1282
01:43:49,531 --> 01:43:50,551
[SPEAKER_08]: Where the wild things are, I'm guessing.

1283
01:43:50,591 --> 01:43:50,711
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

1284
01:43:51,111 --> 01:43:55,212
[SPEAKER_08]: It got beat by a little indie title that has made it big called Paranormal Activity.

1285
01:43:55,692 --> 01:43:56,312
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to see that.

1286
01:43:56,332 --> 01:43:56,913
[SPEAKER_08]: I should have figured.

1287
01:43:56,933 --> 01:43:57,933
[SPEAKER_08]: It was the number one movie.

1288
01:43:58,033 --> 01:43:58,373
[SPEAKER_08]: Now that...

1289
01:43:59,418 --> 01:44:01,280
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually get to see that for free pretty soon.

1290
01:44:01,760 --> 01:44:09,026
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, that movie's made a lot of buzz based off of the internet and Twitter.

1291
01:44:09,366 --> 01:44:17,032
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, funny enough, we're 10 years, believe it or not, after the Blair Witch Project, which is a very similar kind of marketing, although technology's changed in the past 10 years.

1292
01:44:17,372 --> 01:44:20,655
[SPEAKER_08]: But Paranormal Activity is sort of 2009's Blair Witch Project in a way.

1293
01:44:21,315 --> 01:44:23,037
[SPEAKER_03]: They're marketing it like the Wii, whereas...

1294
01:44:24,146 --> 01:44:29,749
[SPEAKER_03]: We're not going to put it out everywhere and you're going to hear how awesome this movie is and you're going to be like, I wish I could see it, but it's not in my town.

1295
01:44:29,789 --> 01:44:33,992
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we're going to flood the market with it and then everyone goes and sees it.

1296
01:44:34,972 --> 01:44:36,153
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's what they did this weekend.

1297
01:44:37,093 --> 01:44:39,515
[SPEAKER_08]: Actdeft in chat says, enough is enough.

1298
01:44:40,015 --> 01:44:43,697
[SPEAKER_08]: I've had it with these motherfucking saws in my motherfucking movies.

1299
01:44:44,917 --> 01:44:47,339
[SPEAKER_08]: And that apparently might be what some people are saying about Guitar Hero.

1300
01:44:47,419 --> 01:44:47,699
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

1301
01:44:48,305 --> 01:44:49,286
[SPEAKER_08]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1302
01:45:09,426 --> 01:45:11,328
[SPEAKER_08]: Except for the fact that maybe they just put out too much.

1303
01:45:11,348 --> 01:45:12,289
[SPEAKER_03]: Really, here's what comes out.

1304
01:45:12,749 --> 01:45:14,291
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's what comes down to.

1305
01:45:14,311 --> 01:45:16,092
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think the Van Halen game was needed.

1306
01:45:16,573 --> 01:45:18,435
[SPEAKER_08]: I think in the Metallica game and all this other stuff.

1307
01:45:18,455 --> 01:45:19,375
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't need to buy them.

1308
01:45:20,497 --> 01:45:22,218
[SPEAKER_03]: But Guitar Hero fans do buy them.

1309
01:45:22,979 --> 01:45:26,682
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the reason you keep putting them out is because you keep buying them.

1310
01:45:26,762 --> 01:45:27,163
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know...

1311
01:45:28,260 --> 01:45:28,901
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1312
01:45:45,309 --> 01:45:47,049
[SPEAKER_08]: Quick question chat and then we'll get into the next story.

1313
01:45:47,190 --> 01:45:52,371
[SPEAKER_08]: Xlink asks, speaking of Saw basically, how many people have bought Saw the video game?

1314
01:45:52,651 --> 01:45:53,411
[SPEAKER_08]: Any idea, Loki?

1315
01:45:54,251 --> 01:45:55,271
[SPEAKER_08]: How that game's moving?

1316
01:45:55,512 --> 01:45:56,272
[SPEAKER_08]: The Saw video game?

1317
01:45:57,752 --> 01:45:59,993
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know, but I can find out.

1318
01:46:00,013 --> 01:46:01,853
[SPEAKER_08]: Look that up while Jamie brings us the next story.

1319
01:46:02,093 --> 01:46:05,474
[SPEAKER_08]: If we can move on there and then we'll figure that out later.

1320
01:46:06,468 --> 01:46:13,754
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, for people who are playing Marvel Ultimate Alliance 2, there actually is a future character coming up for download.

1321
01:46:14,875 --> 01:46:15,476
[SPEAKER_10]: It's Cable.

1322
01:46:15,776 --> 01:46:20,520
[SPEAKER_10]: Right now he's an NPC, but he will be downloadable to be playable.

1323
01:46:20,780 --> 01:46:22,381
[SPEAKER_10]: I guess that's a pay to unlock type of thing.

1324
01:46:23,462 --> 01:46:23,602
[SPEAKER_10]: And...

1325
01:46:25,897 --> 01:46:30,879
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I hope he's not overly imbalanced.

1326
01:46:31,259 --> 01:46:36,521
[SPEAKER_10]: But also, for more missions, there's a Psylocke mission coming out too, which will be pretty cool.

1327
01:46:41,803 --> 01:46:43,624
[SPEAKER_08]: Have you played the Ultimate Alliance game yet?

1328
01:46:44,064 --> 01:46:44,764
[SPEAKER_08]: The new one?

1329
01:46:45,224 --> 01:46:46,625
[SPEAKER_10]: No, it's still sitting right here on my desk.

1330
01:46:46,805 --> 01:46:46,985
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't!

1331
01:46:47,844 --> 01:46:48,584
[SPEAKER_08]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1332
01:47:15,987 --> 01:47:17,047
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, that's not great.

1333
01:47:17,268 --> 01:47:18,728
[SPEAKER_03]: It only came out a couple weeks ago.

1334
01:47:19,208 --> 01:47:20,949
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is only showing in the first two weeks.

1335
01:47:22,770 --> 01:47:26,071
[SPEAKER_03]: But it has dropped in half versus week one, week two.

1336
01:47:26,111 --> 01:47:29,112
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe it'll bump up again with the new movie out and everything.

1337
01:47:29,152 --> 01:47:30,212
[SPEAKER_03]: Halloween and all that, yeah.

1338
01:47:30,252 --> 01:47:31,533
[SPEAKER_03]: Halloween, maybe.

1339
01:47:33,134 --> 01:47:35,575
[SPEAKER_03]: PlayStation 3 version sold only 20,000 units.

1340
01:47:35,675 --> 01:47:37,035
[SPEAKER_03]: So 50,000 total.

1341
01:47:38,316 --> 01:47:40,376
[SPEAKER_03]: But once again, I bring up the point.

1342
01:47:40,416 --> 01:47:43,357
[SPEAKER_03]: These publishers are putting out games that are only selling under 100,000 units or whatever.

1343
01:47:45,916 --> 01:47:48,698
[SPEAKER_03]: President Cat could do quite well over here.

1344
01:47:48,898 --> 01:47:58,763
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, if their expectations are just to sell maybe a few hundred thousand units, if that, or even like a hundred thousand units, it's easy on the Wii.

1345
01:47:59,043 --> 01:47:59,804
[SPEAKER_08]: Easy to do that.

1346
01:48:00,084 --> 01:48:05,547
[SPEAKER_08]: Out of curiosity, and I apologize because I know we don't have the answer right in front of you, but how does this compare to Silent Hill Homecoming?

1347
01:48:05,587 --> 01:48:12,311
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I know at one point they were talking about Saw was supposed to be like Konami's new series that...

1348
01:48:12,711 --> 01:48:19,253
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess was going to coexist with Silent Hill, but you kind of get the weird feeling, are they going to try and replace Silent Hill with Saw?

1349
01:48:19,513 --> 01:48:30,196
[SPEAKER_08]: Silent Hill Homecoming kind of took a lot of crap from the reviewers and the fact that they just outright cancelled the game for Japan, which kind of says something about their faith in the game as it is.

1350
01:48:30,476 --> 01:48:32,237
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think the game was terrible by any means.

1351
01:48:32,917 --> 01:48:34,117
[SPEAKER_08]: It was different from the other games.

1352
01:48:34,137 --> 01:48:36,578
[SPEAKER_08]: You could tell it was developed somewhere else, but I don't think it was bad at all.

1353
01:48:36,958 --> 01:48:37,698
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, let's see.

1354
01:48:37,898 --> 01:48:39,779
[SPEAKER_03]: In comparison, for example...

1355
01:48:40,439 --> 01:48:45,941
[SPEAKER_03]: The Xbox 360 version now of Saw only sold 20,000 units in the first week.

1356
01:48:46,421 --> 01:48:52,203
[SPEAKER_03]: The Xbox 360 version of Silent Hill sold 47,000 units in the first week.

1357
01:48:52,963 --> 01:48:54,684
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, there you go.

1358
01:48:55,504 --> 01:49:02,186
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, about almost 30,000 more units and then continued to sell and still continuing to sell.

1359
01:49:04,047 --> 01:49:06,488
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, once again, it's a little early to see, but...

1360
01:49:07,406 --> 01:49:08,246
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1361
01:49:33,567 --> 01:49:35,368
[SPEAKER_08]: And you don't just pull these numbers out of your ass.

1362
01:49:35,408 --> 01:49:44,271
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, you do a little bit, but keep in mind, for those that may not have listened to the show before, Loki, you work in distribution, so you have a pretty good thumbprint on, you know, who's ordering what.

1363
01:49:44,331 --> 01:49:52,454
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, yeah, and I'm also looking at, there's a website, VGCharts, that pulls stuff from MPD numbers, so I'm looking at what the actual numbers were each week.

1364
01:49:52,954 --> 01:49:59,617
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, Silent Hill on PS3 sold 41,000 units in the first week versus the 20 that sold, you know,

1365
01:50:00,817 --> 01:50:05,942
[SPEAKER_03]: Not even 20, you know, probably like 15 for Saw, so.

1366
01:50:06,223 --> 01:50:17,374
[SPEAKER_08]: Complete random-ass question I'm going to put out there, and maybe you don't even know the answer to this, but is there any highly anticipated game coming out this season that you're just noticing is not selling?

1367
01:50:17,934 --> 01:50:19,656
[SPEAKER_08]: That you're just not selling copies of it?

1368
01:50:20,297 --> 01:50:21,578
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not selling copies of it.

1369
01:50:22,199 --> 01:50:22,319
[SPEAKER_03]: Um...

1370
01:50:24,548 --> 01:50:25,128
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

1371
01:50:47,369 --> 01:50:48,930
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm putting you on the spot a little bit.

1372
01:50:49,070 --> 01:50:50,670
[SPEAKER_03]: Rabbids Go Home isn't doing very well.

1373
01:50:51,250 --> 01:50:54,652
[SPEAKER_03]: Not a lot of people are picking that up in large quantities like the other Rabbids games.

1374
01:50:55,152 --> 01:50:56,552
[SPEAKER_03]: They're kind of getting worn.

1375
01:50:56,813 --> 01:50:59,574
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess they've worn out their welcome.

1376
01:51:02,094 --> 01:51:03,055
[SPEAKER_03]: I would say maybe...

1377
01:51:06,795 --> 01:51:07,255
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, man.

1378
01:51:07,916 --> 01:51:12,359
[SPEAKER_03]: I had to beg and plead for Demon's Souls.

1379
01:51:13,039 --> 01:51:15,581
[SPEAKER_03]: And then everybody after the fact was scrambling for that.

1380
01:51:15,601 --> 01:51:16,922
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, dude, I told you.

1381
01:51:17,222 --> 01:51:17,922
[SPEAKER_03]: You should have listened to me.

1382
01:51:18,843 --> 01:51:20,604
[SPEAKER_03]: So is that game actually moving now?

1383
01:51:20,764 --> 01:51:21,425
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah, it's moving.

1384
01:51:21,725 --> 01:51:22,825
[SPEAKER_03]: They're sold out at Atlus.

1385
01:51:23,006 --> 01:51:24,507
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, they keep selling out.

1386
01:51:25,187 --> 01:51:29,690
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's probably the fastest moving Atlus title I've seen.

1387
01:51:29,710 --> 01:51:30,651
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1388
01:51:31,704 --> 01:51:32,145
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1389
01:51:45,173 --> 01:51:52,396
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd say probably this fall, the one title that's not going to do as well as the company's hoping, I'm guessing, would be Avatar.

1390
01:51:52,836 --> 01:51:54,937
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think it's going to do that well, which is too bad.

1391
01:51:55,037 --> 01:51:56,177
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, the one based on the movie?

1392
01:51:56,697 --> 01:51:57,298
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1393
01:51:57,418 --> 01:51:58,658
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that movie's going to bomb.

1394
01:51:58,678 --> 01:52:01,059
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that movie's going to be a big fucking bomb.

1395
01:52:01,179 --> 01:52:02,480
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not knocking it.

1396
01:52:02,720 --> 01:52:07,601
[SPEAKER_08]: It actually looks kind of neat, but I just think it's going to be one of those movies that is, especially considering who's behind it.

1397
01:52:07,621 --> 01:52:08,162
[SPEAKER_08]: The hype is too high.

1398
01:52:08,282 --> 01:52:09,822
[SPEAKER_08]: The hype is way too high.

1399
01:52:09,982 --> 01:52:11,063
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that movie's going to bomb.

1400
01:52:11,363 --> 01:52:12,303
[SPEAKER_08]: Of course, watch me be wrong.

1401
01:52:13,143 --> 01:52:13,484
[SPEAKER_08]: Who knows?

1402
01:52:15,040 --> 01:52:19,462
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, this is something, you know, that may not sell a lot, but I think this looks freaking phenomenal.

1403
01:52:19,502 --> 01:52:21,142
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you guys know what a Microsoft... Oh, I know one.

1404
01:52:21,363 --> 01:52:21,603
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, what?

1405
01:52:21,643 --> 01:52:22,923
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is really sad.

1406
01:52:23,243 --> 01:52:25,324
[SPEAKER_03]: Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles The Crystal Bearers.

1407
01:52:25,624 --> 01:52:25,904
[SPEAKER_03]: Ooh.

1408
01:52:25,944 --> 01:52:26,685
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a tough sell.

1409
01:52:27,025 --> 01:52:31,186
[SPEAKER_03]: No one wants to buy it because the last one was a port of a DS title and everybody hated it.

1410
01:52:31,527 --> 01:52:33,968
[SPEAKER_03]: And so they're like, oh, Crystal Chronicles, I'm not bringing that shit in.

1411
01:52:34,248 --> 01:52:34,468
[SPEAKER_03]: Hmm.

1412
01:52:34,588 --> 01:52:34,728
[SPEAKER_03]: So...

1413
01:52:36,315 --> 01:52:36,875
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks for watching!

1414
01:52:58,584 --> 01:52:59,065
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1415
01:53:13,638 --> 01:53:15,199
[SPEAKER_08]: Dungeons and Dragons, essentially.

1416
01:53:15,639 --> 01:53:28,344
[SPEAKER_08]: It's using the surface table, get this, you can actually plot out little pieces on the map, and they actually show you a little tour of this, you can put pieces on the grid, so you can actually, you know how people get out their big charts and their pen and paper to move characters around?

1417
01:53:28,584 --> 01:53:34,146
[SPEAKER_08]: Imagine being able to do all that on the surface, and look at that, D20 flying in, that you can actually roll there virtually.

1418
01:53:34,386 --> 01:53:35,287
[SPEAKER_10]: And you can't cheat!

1419
01:53:36,087 --> 01:53:40,349
[SPEAKER_08]: You can do that virtually there on the Microsoft Surface, and you can actually move these little pieces around.

1420
01:53:40,809 --> 01:53:44,292
[SPEAKER_08]: Now this is going to make the nerds want to have one of these in their home.

1421
01:53:44,332 --> 01:53:46,054
[SPEAKER_08]: I think this is pretty cool having this.

1422
01:53:46,074 --> 01:53:48,436
[SPEAKER_08]: This is just a proof of concept for right now.

1423
01:53:49,157 --> 01:53:53,221
[SPEAKER_08]: But I think a lot of people have looked at these surfaces going, what do you do with it?

1424
01:53:54,497 --> 01:53:58,099
[SPEAKER_08]: There's not a lot to do here, but this is starting to get really expensive too.

1425
01:53:59,120 --> 01:53:59,580
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, I'm sure.

1426
01:53:59,641 --> 01:54:02,182
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I've never seen one outside of that one hotel.

1427
01:54:02,562 --> 01:54:11,949
[SPEAKER_08]: And it seems like that's where you're going to see them is in the lobbies of hotels for people to find coffee shops and expensive restaurants they want to go to and so forth.

1428
01:54:12,489 --> 01:54:15,651
[SPEAKER_08]: Salacious Pop in chat says some casinos in Vegas are starting to use it.

1429
01:54:15,691 --> 01:54:16,592
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I can see that too.

1430
01:54:16,612 --> 01:54:20,134
[SPEAKER_08]: Red Entertainment says Microsoft Surface is a cool thing to play around with.

1431
01:54:20,895 --> 01:54:24,037
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like watching TV while high without actually being high.

1432
01:54:26,440 --> 01:54:28,262
[SPEAKER_08]: It certainly is something a little different.

1433
01:54:29,023 --> 01:54:29,924
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a cool little device.

1434
01:54:29,964 --> 01:54:31,426
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it just might be a little ahead of its time.

1435
01:54:31,686 --> 01:54:33,509
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not the kind of thing people are going to have in their homes.

1436
01:54:33,849 --> 01:54:36,993
[SPEAKER_08]: You're not going to be replacing your coffee table with a surface at any time soon.

1437
01:54:37,194 --> 01:54:37,474
[SPEAKER_10]: I will.

1438
01:54:37,834 --> 01:54:38,936
[SPEAKER_10]: Then again, I don't have a coffee table.

1439
01:54:39,863 --> 01:54:42,305
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't spill a drink on it, though, or you're fucked.

1440
01:54:42,405 --> 01:54:44,406
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, that's the other nervous thing about it.

1441
01:54:44,426 --> 01:54:50,811
[SPEAKER_08]: Of course, then again, I've dropped my iPhone I don't know how many times, and it still works, but I also put a protective case on it.

1442
01:54:50,891 --> 01:54:52,792
[SPEAKER_10]: I've dropped mine on concrete.

1443
01:54:52,952 --> 01:54:53,272
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, me too.

1444
01:54:53,292 --> 01:54:55,394
[SPEAKER_10]: And it hasn't broken, and I don't have a case on mine.

1445
01:54:56,092 --> 01:54:56,512
[SPEAKER_08]: Wow.

1446
01:54:56,972 --> 01:55:05,375
[SPEAKER_08]: See, I have a big, thick case on mine because when I got my iPhone, I said, okay, I know this guy's going to get dropped, so I need to figure out a case I can put on it.

1447
01:55:05,435 --> 01:55:07,296
[SPEAKER_08]: Wow, you don't even have a protective screen on it, do you?

1448
01:55:08,056 --> 01:55:08,737
[SPEAKER_08]: That's pretty amazing.

1449
01:55:08,817 --> 01:55:09,077
[SPEAKER_08]: Nope.

1450
01:55:09,537 --> 01:55:09,837
[SPEAKER_08]: Wow.

1451
01:55:09,877 --> 01:55:10,537
[SPEAKER_10]: Look at the back of it.

1452
01:55:11,398 --> 01:55:12,058
[SPEAKER_08]: That's not bad at all.

1453
01:55:12,178 --> 01:55:12,278
[SPEAKER_10]: Nope.

1454
01:55:12,698 --> 01:55:13,958
[SPEAKER_10]: But then again... Yours is silver.

1455
01:55:13,978 --> 01:55:14,679
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't even know they made them.

1456
01:55:14,699 --> 01:55:15,439
[SPEAKER_08]: The original ones.

1457
01:55:16,139 --> 01:55:16,279
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh.

1458
01:55:16,379 --> 01:55:17,340
[SPEAKER_10]: I have an old-school iPhone.

1459
01:55:17,480 --> 01:55:17,800
[SPEAKER_08]: Interesting.

1460
01:55:19,079 --> 01:55:23,303
[SPEAKER_10]: Which I'm going to auction off when I get my 3GS for a holiday.

1461
01:55:23,364 --> 01:55:28,549
[SPEAKER_03]: I think those things are pretty waterproof because it looks like they have a picture, like a fancy picture.

1462
01:55:28,569 --> 01:55:31,872
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks like someone in a casino that have their drinks set on it.

1463
01:55:32,333 --> 01:55:39,000
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that because the monitor is actually so inside of it, you know, and the table goes way beyond the actual monitor.

1464
01:55:39,020 --> 01:55:40,862
[SPEAKER_03]: If you spilled something, it would just drip over the edge.

1465
01:55:41,162 --> 01:55:41,302
[SPEAKER_08]: Hmm.

1466
01:55:42,283 --> 01:55:43,323
[SPEAKER_08]: One more comment from Red Entertainment.

1467
01:55:43,403 --> 01:55:46,464
[SPEAKER_08]: NBC News used Surface during their 2008 election coverage.

1468
01:55:46,824 --> 01:55:52,185
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, and also that probably has a lot to do with that Microsoft and NBC collaborate on a lot of stuff.

1469
01:55:52,225 --> 01:55:53,466
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, MSNBC, hello.

1470
01:55:54,306 --> 01:56:02,007
[SPEAKER_08]: But then, you know, I like watching election year coverage because that's when all the channels try to roll out their new technology to get you to watch them.

1471
01:56:02,288 --> 01:56:03,988
[SPEAKER_08]: Remember when CNN did the holograms?

1472
01:56:05,413 --> 01:56:08,316
[SPEAKER_08]: I dropped my iPhone the other night and totally cracked the screen.

1473
01:56:08,376 --> 01:56:11,899
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know how many times I dropped it before and it had been fine.

1474
01:56:20,427 --> 01:56:22,048
[SPEAKER_10]: Dan did his first time he got his.

1475
01:56:22,268 --> 01:56:23,469
[SPEAKER_10]: He cracked it in his pocket.

1476
01:56:23,689 --> 01:56:24,970
[SPEAKER_03]: So careful, careful, folks.

1477
01:56:25,010 --> 01:56:28,933
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I don't think I'll be buying one of these.

1478
01:56:29,373 --> 01:56:31,274
[SPEAKER_03]: They're $12,500.

1479
01:56:32,535 --> 01:56:37,399
[SPEAKER_08]: But you know, like in five years, that price is going to... Remember when HDTVs were $8,000?

1480
01:56:37,459 --> 01:56:39,660
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry, it's still way too damn expensive.

1481
01:56:39,700 --> 01:56:44,003
[SPEAKER_03]: You get an HDTV, put a nice touchscreen interface on it, surface, done.

1482
01:56:44,363 --> 01:56:47,185
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you don't really... I don't understand why this stuff's so expensive.

1483
01:56:47,225 --> 01:56:47,806
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not a $12,000 unit.

1484
01:56:47,886 --> 01:56:48,286
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, come on.

1485
01:56:50,087 --> 01:56:53,569
[SPEAKER_08]: Salacious Pop was just asking as we were talking about it on air because there's a little delay.

1486
01:56:53,989 --> 01:56:56,270
[SPEAKER_08]: LOL, what channel did the Princess Leia shit?

1487
01:56:56,590 --> 01:56:59,251
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a great way to describe what CNN did that year.

1488
01:57:00,252 --> 01:57:04,214
[SPEAKER_08]: And Red Entertainment follows up with Wolf Blitzer, I am your father.

1489
01:57:05,305 --> 01:57:05,525
[SPEAKER_08]: Love it.

1490
01:57:05,545 --> 01:57:06,005
[SPEAKER_08]: So wrong.

1491
01:57:06,405 --> 01:57:07,065
[SPEAKER_08]: Funny, funny, funny.

1492
01:57:36,435 --> 01:57:55,818
[SPEAKER_08]: uh let's see really random topic and then we're going to get it into the mailbag your emails at mailbag at orange loss radio.com DarkSakura will read here in a moment but I'm going to throw out this completely random question from chat it's like throw random questions at Loki night I swear uh Deakman is asking Loki did you see this announcement that a custom firmware for the PSP 3000 is supposed to be released next week

1493
01:57:57,059 --> 01:57:57,500
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

1494
01:58:15,982 --> 01:58:18,165
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, I'm gonna go look at this up.

1495
01:58:18,546 --> 01:58:19,887
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, you look it up.

1496
01:58:20,208 --> 01:58:33,344
[SPEAKER_08]: In the meantime, DarkSakura's gonna dive into the mailbag at mailbag at orangelaundrater.com and read your emails, cause dang it, you send us emails and show us a little love, so we show you some love back in a little segment we call the mailbag.

1497
01:58:34,125 --> 01:58:42,712
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, um, hi LLR, thanks for reading my Twitter questions while playing on the short show about the official Konami DDR tournament.

1498
01:58:43,193 --> 01:58:47,836
[SPEAKER_10]: Following up on it, I was wondering what you guys thought about the age restrictions on Konami's official DDR tournament.

1499
01:58:47,937 --> 01:58:50,299
[SPEAKER_10]: I have enclosed a snippet about it on the official summary.

1500
01:58:51,119 --> 01:58:56,021
[SPEAKER_10]: All registrants must be between the ages of 13 and 32 years as of April 1st, 2009.

1501
01:58:57,101 --> 01:59:01,403
[SPEAKER_10]: According to these rules, I actually would be ineligible to compete next year if there was another tournament.

1502
01:59:01,863 --> 01:59:03,824
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not sure what to think.

1503
01:59:04,664 --> 01:59:07,145
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe they are thinking someone hits 32, they fall apart.

1504
01:59:08,265 --> 01:59:16,208
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyway, give it the good work, peace out, and triple A. That's from Jammer J. I think that's stupid.

1505
01:59:17,212 --> 01:59:19,493
[SPEAKER_08]: It's incredibly stupid and kind of insulting.

1506
01:59:19,653 --> 01:59:22,175
[SPEAKER_08]: Especially to the fanbase that kind of helped DDR get big.

1507
01:59:22,255 --> 01:59:26,397
[SPEAKER_08]: But this is exactly why I had no idea about this until you mentioned it.

1508
01:59:26,417 --> 01:59:27,037
[SPEAKER_08]: Because guess what?

1509
01:59:27,057 --> 01:59:27,978
[SPEAKER_08]: I stopped following it.

1510
01:59:28,078 --> 01:59:28,538
[SPEAKER_08]: Then again?

1511
01:59:28,598 --> 01:59:30,099
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe that's why I'm not allowed to participate.

1512
01:59:30,379 --> 01:59:30,739
[SPEAKER_10]: Then again?

1513
01:59:31,920 --> 01:59:33,761
[SPEAKER_10]: Next year I won't be allowed to participate.

1514
01:59:33,801 --> 01:59:35,061
[SPEAKER_10]: I was 32 April 1st of 2009.

1515
01:59:35,522 --> 01:59:37,443
[SPEAKER_08]: I know, I know.

1516
01:59:37,743 --> 01:59:39,163
[SPEAKER_08]: It's ridiculous.

1517
01:59:39,464 --> 01:59:40,204
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, it... Whatever.

1518
01:59:41,545 --> 01:59:41,845
[SPEAKER_08]: Whatever.

1519
01:59:42,583 --> 01:59:46,304
[SPEAKER_08]: If you want to alienate some of your potential fans that way, go for it.

1520
01:59:46,564 --> 01:59:46,964
[SPEAKER_08]: Whatever.

1521
01:59:50,165 --> 01:59:52,446
[SPEAKER_10]: I need a new nose, Rob.

1522
01:59:52,866 --> 01:59:53,326
[SPEAKER_08]: It's weird.

1523
01:59:53,406 --> 01:59:55,367
[SPEAKER_08]: I am and I'm not over the DDR thing.

1524
01:59:56,167 --> 01:59:58,228
[SPEAKER_08]: Some days I go, I'm so done with DDR.

1525
01:59:58,328 --> 02:00:00,129
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just not cool anymore.

1526
02:00:00,169 --> 02:00:02,409
[SPEAKER_08]: But then I go, I kind of want that new one on the 360 PS3.

1527
02:00:02,529 --> 02:00:04,070
[SPEAKER_08]: It looks kind of awesome.

1528
02:00:04,410 --> 02:00:05,990
[SPEAKER_03]: My sheet metal came in the other day.

1529
02:00:07,071 --> 02:00:08,031
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what that's for, right?

1530
02:00:09,371 --> 02:00:11,252
[SPEAKER_03]: I know, for your little DDR project.

1531
02:00:11,572 --> 02:00:14,092
[SPEAKER_08]: But you're still in your 20s, so whatever.

1532
02:00:14,113 --> 02:00:14,813
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, whatever.

1533
02:00:14,893 --> 02:00:16,013
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, barely.

1534
02:00:16,213 --> 02:00:16,813
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, God.

1535
02:00:18,454 --> 02:00:20,394
[SPEAKER_03]: You young whippersnapper in your DDR mat.

1536
02:00:20,934 --> 02:00:21,694
[SPEAKER_03]: Listen, okay.

1537
02:00:21,714 --> 02:00:29,916
[SPEAKER_03]: Our way so far is getting official Konami stickers from the arcade machine that are going to go on this thing.

1538
02:00:29,956 --> 02:00:31,997
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, that's how awesome it's going to look.

1539
02:00:32,157 --> 02:00:35,538
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, how do you feel that in four years or whatever, you're dead to Konami?

1540
02:00:36,559 --> 02:00:38,761
[SPEAKER_08]: Deadman Walking, Deadman Dancing Deadman Dancing

1541
02:01:04,110 --> 02:01:05,551
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, over DDR, sorry.

1542
02:01:05,571 --> 02:01:08,773
[SPEAKER_08]: Which is just a scam to get you to buy more dance mats.

1543
02:01:09,293 --> 02:01:19,840
[SPEAKER_08]: I know we have a lot of listeners that are still attached to the music games, and yes, we founded the station on it, but I guess now that some of us are getting that 32 threshold, I guess we are officially too old for DDR.

1544
02:01:19,860 --> 02:01:20,841
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, here's the other thing, too.

1545
02:01:20,981 --> 02:01:23,743
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, look at their game releases for DDR.

1546
02:01:23,983 --> 02:01:24,704
[SPEAKER_03]: They're not doing...

1547
02:01:25,544 --> 02:01:28,126
[SPEAKER_03]: Game only releases, not until like way later on.

1548
02:01:28,386 --> 02:01:32,688
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you want to really stick with DDR and buy a new release each year, guess what?

1549
02:01:32,728 --> 02:01:34,929
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going to get Softmat to go with that release.

1550
02:01:35,110 --> 02:01:37,651
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's going to be $10 more than it would normally be by itself.

1551
02:01:39,212 --> 02:01:40,272
[SPEAKER_08]: However, I will say this.

1552
02:01:40,793 --> 02:01:45,776
[SPEAKER_08]: If Beatmania 2DX or whatever goes to PlayStation 3, I'm very interested in what's next for that franchise.

1553
02:01:45,796 --> 02:01:47,216
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I've always loved Beatmania.

1554
02:01:47,396 --> 02:01:49,398
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, if it goes to the PlayStation 3, you can import that shit.

1555
02:01:50,158 --> 02:01:51,679
[SPEAKER_08]: Ooh, I didn't even think of that.

1556
02:01:52,139 --> 02:01:53,000
[SPEAKER_08]: Good point, my man.

1557
02:01:53,160 --> 02:01:53,520
[SPEAKER_08]: Good point.

1558
02:01:55,005 --> 02:01:55,265
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyhow.

1559
02:01:56,386 --> 02:01:56,946
[SPEAKER_08]: More emails.

1560
02:01:57,147 --> 02:01:57,347
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry.

1561
02:01:57,827 --> 02:01:59,588
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry, I'm kind of feeling like crap right now.

1562
02:02:02,330 --> 02:02:07,693
[SPEAKER_10]: This one is a Kingdom Hearts 358 two-day mini-review.

1563
02:02:09,194 --> 02:02:15,037
[SPEAKER_10]: It's like, well, I'm saying this because you guys probably aren't going to play the game, so I thought that writing a review would help motivate you guys to buy it or at least rent it.

1564
02:02:15,117 --> 02:02:15,858
[SPEAKER_10]: I beat it in a week.

1565
02:02:15,978 --> 02:02:19,300
[SPEAKER_10]: Dude, please use punctuation and capitalize your thing, because...

1566
02:02:19,861 --> 02:02:21,502
[SPEAKER_08]: I saw a commercial for the game on TV today.

1567
02:02:22,542 --> 02:02:23,242
[SPEAKER_03]: Just random thought.

1568
02:02:23,402 --> 02:02:29,124
[SPEAKER_03]: I never made it through the first game or played the second game or played the DS game.

1569
02:02:29,144 --> 02:02:30,144
[SPEAKER_03]: I glitched my second game.

1570
02:02:30,685 --> 02:02:33,806
[SPEAKER_03]: Or played the PlayStation 2 port of the Game Boy Advance game.

1571
02:02:34,306 --> 02:02:39,388
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm so lost in it right now that I'm just not going to even bother.

1572
02:02:39,428 --> 02:02:40,628
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm going to sum this up.

1573
02:02:40,688 --> 02:02:43,269
[SPEAKER_10]: You play as Roxas and he gives it an 8.

1574
02:02:44,498 --> 02:02:45,638
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't even know who Roxas is.

1575
02:02:45,718 --> 02:02:46,779
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I know who he is.

1576
02:02:47,139 --> 02:02:51,980
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, I know who he is because I've heard about the second game, but this character means nothing to me.

1577
02:02:52,200 --> 02:02:57,282
[SPEAKER_10]: Rewrite your review with proper grammar and spelling and everything, and I'll put it up on the site.

1578
02:02:58,862 --> 02:03:02,963
[SPEAKER_08]: I do love the Kingdom Hearts games, but I'm just not interested in these handheld ones.

1579
02:03:03,283 --> 02:03:09,085
[SPEAKER_08]: And this all goes back to my whole, like, I'm just not as big of a fan of handheld games as I am playing them on my big TV.

1580
02:03:09,645 --> 02:03:16,349
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'll wait until the next big official Kingdom Hearts 3 comes out and leave all these side stories on the side.

1581
02:03:17,230 --> 02:03:19,551
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, this one comes from AZHP.

1582
02:03:20,372 --> 02:03:30,198
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey OLR, I was listening to one of your September podcasts catching up on the backlog you flooded the feed with and I remembered hearing that Rob said he got food poisoning from a sandwich chain that toasts its subs.

1583
02:03:30,738 --> 02:03:31,418
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I'm not surprised.

1584
02:03:31,859 --> 02:03:37,342
[SPEAKER_10]: I used to work at Century Theater to save up for Nintendo Wii near one such store of that chain.

1585
02:03:37,842 --> 02:03:37,962
[SPEAKER_10]: Gross.

1586
02:03:37,982 --> 02:03:38,182
[SPEAKER_10]: Gross.

1587
02:03:38,202 --> 02:03:38,322
[SPEAKER_10]: Gross.

1588
02:04:04,017 --> 02:04:06,940
[SPEAKER_08]: Most of those stores are franchised anyway.

1589
02:04:07,780 --> 02:04:10,022
[SPEAKER_10]: One by my work is super clean.

1590
02:04:10,302 --> 02:04:11,903
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, they closed one not far from here.

1591
02:04:12,464 --> 02:04:14,145
[SPEAKER_08]: The one that was in the Target lot closed.

1592
02:04:14,205 --> 02:04:15,806
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, but I don't work over there.

1593
02:04:17,167 --> 02:04:18,128
[SPEAKER_08]: They're not all doing great.

1594
02:04:19,469 --> 02:04:19,829
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

1595
02:04:20,510 --> 02:04:21,751
[SPEAKER_10]: Ooh, we got an angry letter.

1596
02:04:23,312 --> 02:04:23,812
[SPEAKER_10]: Angry letter.

1597
02:04:23,913 --> 02:04:25,093
[SPEAKER_08]: I love angry emails.

1598
02:04:25,154 --> 02:04:25,414
[SPEAKER_08]: Yay!

1599
02:04:26,280 --> 02:04:27,701
[SPEAKER_10]: and thankfully I sound like crap now.

1600
02:04:28,242 --> 02:04:34,047
[SPEAKER_10]: Dear OLR, I listened to the podcast of the October 18th show and was honestly astounded at what I heard.

1601
02:04:34,407 --> 02:04:40,172
[SPEAKER_10]: Upon reflection, what did I expect to come out of the mouths of people who live in the liberal enclave that is California?

1602
02:04:40,772 --> 02:04:43,355
[SPEAKER_10]: How can you stand behind the possible presidency of Cat?

1603
02:04:43,875 --> 02:04:52,700
[SPEAKER_10]: Cat has little foreign animal experience and no executive experience and likes the coherent strategy to deal with the growing threat presented by radical fundamental fleets.

1604
02:04:53,741 --> 02:04:56,282
[SPEAKER_10]: I even doubt that Cat is even from this country.

1605
02:04:56,422 --> 02:04:57,763
[SPEAKER_10]: I heard that Cat is a Persian.

1606
02:04:58,904 --> 02:05:02,125
[SPEAKER_10]: Any rational person knows that the true and correct choice for president is Dog.

1607
02:05:03,326 --> 02:05:08,072
[SPEAKER_10]: Dog has expressed his bath-based strategy for dealing with the threat of fleas once and for all.

1608
02:05:08,573 --> 02:05:12,738
[SPEAKER_10]: Dog has a steady paw and is loyal to her previous president, President Burrow.

1609
02:05:14,220 --> 02:05:21,408
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, Dog has chased cars in the past, but after accepting Jesus as his Lord and Master, I can assure you that Dog will never chase cars again.

1610
02:05:22,009 --> 02:05:30,613
[SPEAKER_10]: When you step into the gaming arena on Tuesday, remember who has stuck by you like a loyal friend who treats you like you are its pet and not the dominant person you are.

1611
02:05:31,413 --> 02:05:32,714
[SPEAKER_10]: Vote for Dog for President.

1612
02:05:32,874 --> 02:05:34,115
[SPEAKER_10]: Do it or the fleas win.

1613
02:05:34,375 --> 02:05:38,036
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks for letting me listen from the conservative Eden that is Utah Redertainment.

1614
02:05:38,537 --> 02:05:42,579
[SPEAKER_10]: This message has been brought to you by Glenn Beck, a smart, rational, and sane voice for the future.

1615
02:05:43,019 --> 02:05:45,400
[SPEAKER_10]: If that isn't proof that I'm clearly kidding, what else can I say?

1616
02:05:46,806 --> 02:05:49,687
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I'd have to say that Dog has been known to eat poop.

1617
02:05:51,487 --> 02:05:55,028
[SPEAKER_03]: And honestly, Dog thinks I threw something when I just faked him out.

1618
02:05:55,088 --> 02:06:01,750
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't really know if I can trust Dog to not drool on the issues.

1619
02:06:02,450 --> 02:06:04,791
[SPEAKER_10]: I can rely on Cat to be self-sufficient.

1620
02:06:05,111 --> 02:06:06,532
[SPEAKER_10]: Except for Shermie, who's just fat and lazy.

1621
02:06:06,552 --> 02:06:13,398
[SPEAKER_03]: Granted, Kat has eaten hair, so that's not as bad as poop, but still, both candidates have their flaws.

1622
02:06:13,999 --> 02:06:15,700
[SPEAKER_08]: Redertainment, you ignorant slut.

1623
02:06:16,401 --> 02:06:16,982
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I'm just kidding.

1624
02:06:17,042 --> 02:06:18,563
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually, that was like the email of the century.

1625
02:06:18,783 --> 02:06:19,103
[SPEAKER_08]: Loved it.

1626
02:06:19,304 --> 02:06:20,104
[SPEAKER_10]: That's the best ever.

1627
02:06:20,144 --> 02:06:20,685
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm saving it.

1628
02:06:21,141 --> 02:06:22,522
[SPEAKER_08]: Gold star for you, sir.

1629
02:06:22,722 --> 02:06:26,445
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that is worthy of the gold star email bag segment recipient.

1630
02:06:26,465 --> 02:06:27,446
[SPEAKER_08]: Wouldn't you agree, DarkSakura?

1631
02:06:27,866 --> 02:06:28,407
[SPEAKER_10]: Agreed.

1632
02:06:28,467 --> 02:06:30,429
[SPEAKER_08]: Was proper grammar and punctuation all that used?

1633
02:06:30,549 --> 02:06:30,889
[SPEAKER_10]: Quite.

1634
02:06:31,149 --> 02:06:31,710
[SPEAKER_08]: So there you go.

1635
02:06:31,750 --> 02:06:32,890
[SPEAKER_08]: Gold star recipient.

1636
02:06:32,951 --> 02:06:33,691
[SPEAKER_08]: Applause to you.

1637
02:06:33,971 --> 02:06:34,272
[SPEAKER_08]: Yay.

1638
02:06:34,312 --> 02:06:35,132
[SPEAKER_08]: Close the fanfare, Rob.

1639
02:06:35,953 --> 02:06:36,874
[SPEAKER_08]: I close the fanfare.

1640
02:06:37,454 --> 02:06:38,355
[SPEAKER_08]: Do-do-do-do-do-do.

1641
02:06:38,395 --> 02:06:39,095
[SPEAKER_08]: There's your fanfare.

1642
02:06:42,038 --> 02:06:42,919
[SPEAKER_08]: Well done there, Rob.

1643
02:06:42,979 --> 02:06:43,239
[SPEAKER_02]: Well done.

1644
02:06:43,259 --> 02:06:43,519
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

1645
02:06:44,100 --> 02:06:45,661
[SPEAKER_08]: Does my fanfare get a gold star?

1646
02:06:46,341 --> 02:06:47,082
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, something like that.

1647
02:06:47,102 --> 02:06:47,943
[SPEAKER_10]: Your fanfare gets a...

1648
02:06:50,339 --> 02:06:52,801
[SPEAKER_08]: My God, you're like really sick over there, aren't you?

1649
02:06:53,122 --> 02:06:54,223
[SPEAKER_10]: It's the dust in the room.

1650
02:06:54,263 --> 02:06:54,743
[SPEAKER_10]: Open the window.

1651
02:06:54,963 --> 02:06:56,585
[SPEAKER_08]: What is dust in the room?

1652
02:06:56,785 --> 02:07:04,392
[SPEAKER_10]: No, it's... I opened up my old laptop case to try to find my SD card reader, and it kicked up a crap ton of dust.

1653
02:07:05,433 --> 02:07:06,033
[SPEAKER_10]: So, yeah.

1654
02:07:07,295 --> 02:07:08,556
[SPEAKER_08]: All we are is dust in the room.

1655
02:07:10,297 --> 02:07:13,000
[SPEAKER_08]: That's the official campaign song, by the way, of President Cat.

1656
02:07:14,437 --> 02:07:14,837
[SPEAKER_08]: Not really.

1657
02:07:15,058 --> 02:07:17,360
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that it for emails tonight?

1658
02:07:17,741 --> 02:07:28,372
[SPEAKER_08]: Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com if you want to send your email for possible reading on the air next week.

1659
02:07:28,953 --> 02:07:30,955
[SPEAKER_08]: How much of that is getting picked up by the mics?

1660
02:07:31,215 --> 02:07:31,816
[SPEAKER_08]: Probably a lot.

1661
02:07:33,641 --> 02:07:34,901
[SPEAKER_10]: I hate my nose.

1662
02:07:34,921 --> 02:07:35,381
[SPEAKER_08]: That's the story.

1663
02:07:35,401 --> 02:07:36,242
[SPEAKER_08]: Alert the media.

1664
02:08:07,962 --> 02:08:09,063
[SPEAKER_10]: F you to my nose.

1665
02:08:11,005 --> 02:08:11,745
[SPEAKER_10]: And dust.

1666
02:08:12,686 --> 02:08:13,767
[SPEAKER_10]: And did I mention my nose?

1667
02:08:13,787 --> 02:08:15,688
[SPEAKER_10]: Because F you to my fucking nose.

1668
02:08:16,129 --> 02:08:16,949
[SPEAKER_10]: And the fucking dust.

1669
02:08:17,730 --> 02:08:18,050
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki.

1670
02:08:18,691 --> 02:08:20,652
[SPEAKER_03]: F you to people that have a story about everything.

1671
02:08:21,233 --> 02:08:24,456
[SPEAKER_03]: And I mean, like, we were watching people on the subway.

1672
02:08:25,216 --> 02:08:26,697
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, riding Bart this weekend.

1673
02:08:27,038 --> 02:08:33,483
[SPEAKER_03]: And there was, on the way there, a woman who was talking about... For some reason...

1674
02:08:34,121 --> 02:08:35,342
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1675
02:09:03,399 --> 02:09:04,900
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe he's into recycling.

1676
02:09:04,960 --> 02:09:09,222
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe he's rich in cans, because cans is the new currency.

1677
02:09:10,943 --> 02:09:13,145
[SPEAKER_08]: Under the regime of President Cat.

1678
02:09:14,566 --> 02:09:16,187
[SPEAKER_03]: Catnip is the new currency.

1679
02:09:17,407 --> 02:09:21,710
[SPEAKER_03]: These people, though, just annoy the hell out of me.

1680
02:09:21,830 --> 02:09:24,671
[SPEAKER_03]: They try to one-up everybody's stories and stuff like that.

1681
02:09:24,711 --> 02:09:25,472
[SPEAKER_03]: You know how they have

1682
02:09:26,195 --> 02:09:36,779
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, oh yeah, my cousin lives there, and oh my, I went there and did sheet metal work, and oh, and my dog was from that country and stuff, and like, isn't there a character like that on Saturday Night Live?

1683
02:09:36,799 --> 02:09:37,359
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, there is.

1684
02:09:37,379 --> 02:09:38,199
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1685
02:09:38,580 --> 02:09:39,980
[SPEAKER_03]: I had ten baby cows.

1686
02:09:40,640 --> 02:09:44,902
[SPEAKER_08]: I can't believe Loki just did a great impression of that.

1687
02:09:46,246 --> 02:09:48,366
[SPEAKER_03]: We do impressions of that woman all the time.

1688
02:09:48,406 --> 02:09:48,787
[SPEAKER_03]: It's hilarious.

1689
02:09:48,827 --> 02:09:50,107
[SPEAKER_03]: Especially when we see people like this.

1690
02:09:50,307 --> 02:09:52,267
[SPEAKER_03]: And we were doing that too while she was talking.

1691
02:09:52,287 --> 02:09:55,348
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was like, and yeah.

1692
02:09:55,468 --> 02:09:56,968
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we had Miley Cyrus follow us.

1693
02:09:57,028 --> 02:09:58,969
[SPEAKER_03]: And we were making fun of her the entire day.

1694
02:09:59,269 --> 02:10:00,549
[SPEAKER_03]: And Miley Cyrus followed us, right?

1695
02:10:00,589 --> 02:10:02,049
[SPEAKER_03]: And she was playing music for us.

1696
02:10:02,630 --> 02:10:07,050
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we went to our house on the moon.

1697
02:10:07,431 --> 02:10:09,811
[SPEAKER_03]: And Miley Cyrus followed us because she's our slave.

1698
02:10:12,372 --> 02:10:14,052
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, I hate people who have stories better.

1699
02:10:16,678 --> 02:10:18,559
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh god, I can't follow that up, that's amazing.

1700
02:10:19,100 --> 02:10:27,144
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, I guess my only FU would go to stress, because I have quite a lot of it at work right now, but, you know, it happens.

1701
02:10:27,525 --> 02:10:30,486
[SPEAKER_08]: And FU to the fact that I haven't updated LiveJournal in like three weeks.

1702
02:10:31,007 --> 02:10:32,788
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, I'm seriously falling behind on that stuff.

1703
02:10:33,128 --> 02:10:35,049
[SPEAKER_08]: And, uh, yeah.

1704
02:10:35,649 --> 02:10:37,691
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't like feeling behind on my life.

1705
02:10:38,031 --> 02:10:42,874
[SPEAKER_08]: Kristen Wiig, that's... Oh yeah, she's like the only woman on that show right now, isn't she?

1706
02:10:43,634 --> 02:10:45,976
[SPEAKER_08]: Did they ever fire the one that dropped the F-bomb on air?

1707
02:10:46,596 --> 02:10:47,177
[SPEAKER_08]: Who was that?

1708
02:10:47,477 --> 02:10:48,898
[SPEAKER_08]: Some new chick.

1709
02:10:48,958 --> 02:10:50,399
[SPEAKER_08]: Remember her first show?

1710
02:10:50,539 --> 02:10:51,540
[SPEAKER_08]: She dropped the F-bomb.

1711
02:10:51,941 --> 02:10:55,103
[SPEAKER_08]: Because they gave her a character that said frickin', frickin', frickin' every other word.

1712
02:10:55,123 --> 02:10:57,666
[SPEAKER_08]: And one time she just slipped and said, Fuckin', I would have done the same thing.

1713
02:10:58,916 --> 02:10:59,897
[SPEAKER_08]: I've kind of felt bad for her.

1714
02:11:00,718 --> 02:11:02,039
[SPEAKER_08]: So, anyhow.

1715
02:11:02,720 --> 02:11:05,863
[SPEAKER_08]: And Red Entertainment would like to point out the name of that character is Penelope, the one-upper.

1716
02:11:05,883 --> 02:11:07,224
[SPEAKER_08]: There you go.

1717
02:11:08,286 --> 02:11:10,888
[SPEAKER_08]: And the chat room is saying bless you to Jamie because they can all hear her nose.

1718
02:11:11,449 --> 02:11:12,230
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry.

1719
02:11:12,250 --> 02:11:12,870
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry it happens.

1720
02:11:12,890 --> 02:11:13,711
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, everybody.

1721
02:11:13,791 --> 02:11:14,372
[SPEAKER_10]: I love you.

1722
02:11:14,792 --> 02:11:15,052
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1723
02:11:15,533 --> 02:11:17,955
[SPEAKER_08]: A couple more news stories for you guys, then the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR.

1724
02:11:17,975 --> 02:11:18,055
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki?

1725
02:11:20,697 --> 02:11:20,857
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

1726
02:11:21,397 --> 02:11:24,518
[SPEAKER_03]: So, personally, I haven't played this game yet.

1727
02:11:24,718 --> 02:11:27,459
[SPEAKER_03]: I acquired it for my MAME cabinet earlier today.

1728
02:11:28,139 --> 02:11:29,020
[SPEAKER_03]: But the game is Toki.

1729
02:11:29,520 --> 02:11:33,501
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a 2D side-scrolling game starring an ape.

1730
02:11:34,321 --> 02:11:36,682
[SPEAKER_03]: And apparently it's getting the HD treatment.

1731
02:11:37,442 --> 02:11:43,604
[SPEAKER_03]: The French developer Golgoth Studio is taking the game and completely redoing all the graphics in it.

1732
02:11:43,624 --> 02:11:44,764
[SPEAKER_03]: And it actually looks pretty cool.

1733
02:11:45,504 --> 02:11:46,465
[SPEAKER_03]: So I hope the game's fun.

1734
02:11:46,945 --> 02:11:50,166
[SPEAKER_03]: But it looks like it's all hand-drawn now and...

1735
02:11:51,499 --> 02:11:58,745
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, it's the stuff you would normally expect on BoxArt, but it's all in motion now.

1736
02:11:59,965 --> 02:12:00,146
[SPEAKER_03]: Huh.

1737
02:12:00,606 --> 02:12:04,369
[SPEAKER_03]: But apparently it'll be coming out for games for Windows Live and Xbox Live Arcade.

1738
02:12:05,970 --> 02:12:12,455
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's not like a full retail game, it's kind of more of a mini-game if it's coming out on Arcade, but it looked kind of neat from the screenshots.

1739
02:12:12,495 --> 02:12:14,016
[SPEAKER_03]: It could still be a full game, yeah.

1740
02:12:15,197 --> 02:12:15,717
[SPEAKER_08]: It looks neat.

1741
02:12:15,737 --> 02:12:16,218
[SPEAKER_08]: Interesting.

1742
02:12:17,099 --> 02:12:17,439
[SPEAKER_08]: Interesting.

1743
02:12:18,294 --> 02:12:21,456
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, here's some games that didn't do so great when they came out.

1744
02:12:21,917 --> 02:12:29,403
[SPEAKER_08]: This story kind of caught our attention, and I don't like a whole lot of these top ten kind of lists, but this particular piece on GamesRadar.com, I thought was kind of interesting.

1745
02:12:29,423 --> 02:12:33,246
[SPEAKER_08]: They ran a piece earlier this week called 18 Awesome Games That Died at Retail.

1746
02:12:33,626 --> 02:12:42,293
[SPEAKER_08]: And what I thought about reading this list is I wanted to see how many of these games, Jamie, being the collector of obscure-ass video games, was going to pipe up and say, that game was awesome!

1747
02:12:43,359 --> 02:12:44,940
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1748
02:13:04,513 --> 02:13:07,095
[SPEAKER_08]: That's one of those big games on GameTap, I think.

1749
02:13:07,736 --> 02:13:09,057
[SPEAKER_08]: They were really selling that when that first came out.

1750
02:13:09,077 --> 02:13:10,558
[SPEAKER_08]: Again, this is a list from GamesRadar.

1751
02:13:10,578 --> 02:13:12,619
[SPEAKER_08]: 18 games that died at retail.

1752
02:13:12,920 --> 02:13:22,847
[SPEAKER_08]: Grand Theft Auto Chinatown War is a more recent game coming out because folks saying there's not enough mature games for the system, but at the same time, not enough Nintendo fans wanting mature games.

1753
02:13:23,808 --> 02:13:24,888
[SPEAKER_08]: Why did this die, Loki?

1754
02:13:25,729 --> 02:13:31,533
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't really care to... I didn't like the way it played just because it was a top-down game.

1755
02:13:32,154 --> 02:13:32,274
[SPEAKER_03]: Um...

1756
02:13:33,284 --> 02:13:34,455
[SPEAKER_03]: I prefer more of like the

1757
02:13:35,563 --> 02:13:39,345
[SPEAKER_03]: PSP versions and stuff that are more the 3D stuff you'd see on PlayStation 2.

1758
02:13:39,425 --> 02:13:44,627
[SPEAKER_03]: I understand why they did it that way because the system might not be able to handle that.

1759
02:13:45,107 --> 02:13:58,534
[SPEAKER_03]: However, now we see that Cop of the Recruit is coming out from Ubisoft and looks like what the PlayStation Portable versions of Grand Theft Auto were so it is possible to do it that way but they decided not to.

1760
02:13:59,074 --> 02:14:02,516
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it'll have a better chance on the PSP probably.

1761
02:14:03,796 --> 02:14:06,597
[SPEAKER_08]: Moving on with the list from GamesRadar.com, Psychonauts.

1762
02:14:06,657 --> 02:14:09,458
[SPEAKER_08]: Of course, I'm sure a list like this just wouldn't be complete without Psychonauts.

1763
02:14:09,898 --> 02:14:12,279
[SPEAKER_08]: It gets a lot of praise all around.

1764
02:14:12,319 --> 02:14:18,981
[SPEAKER_08]: It was something that was originally supposed to be an exclusive for Microsoft but then got killed and brought back and just didn't really have a serious marketing push behind it.

1765
02:14:20,061 --> 02:14:23,405
[SPEAKER_08]: I know Jamie will get behind this one, Jet Grind Radio on the Dreamcast.

1766
02:14:23,525 --> 02:14:23,986
[SPEAKER_10]: Hell yeah.

1767
02:14:24,166 --> 02:14:26,208
[SPEAKER_08]: One of the 18 games that tanked here.

1768
02:14:26,608 --> 02:14:32,114
[SPEAKER_08]: Unfortunately, just being the fact that it was on the Dreamcast console put a damper in it there.

1769
02:14:35,875 --> 02:14:38,397
[SPEAKER_08]: Metal Storm is on this list.

1770
02:14:38,517 --> 02:14:43,140
[SPEAKER_08]: This is an old-ass NES side-scrolling game, like on the old-school 8-bit NES.

1771
02:14:43,160 --> 02:14:45,001
[SPEAKER_08]: That was pretty sweet, too.

1772
02:14:45,021 --> 02:14:47,843
[SPEAKER_08]: 1991, but unfortunately, it didn't really sell very well.

1773
02:14:48,563 --> 02:14:56,828
[SPEAKER_08]: They're saying it might have something to do with the fact that it was a crappy localization process and the cutscenes were taken out when it was brought over and it screwed with the color palette.

1774
02:14:58,309 --> 02:14:58,890
[SPEAKER_08]: Shenmue 2.

1775
02:15:00,489 --> 02:15:01,109
[SPEAKER_08]: I think I have that somewhere.

1776
02:15:01,129 --> 02:15:02,130
[SPEAKER_10]: I think I have that somewhere.

1777
02:15:26,673 --> 02:15:34,520
[SPEAKER_08]: Earth Defense Force Oddworld, Stranger's Wrath on the Xbox is on the list Armed and Dangerous for the PC

1778
02:15:35,856 --> 02:16:05,471
[SPEAKER_08]: Otogi 2 Immortal Warriors I never even heard of this game but it was a Japanese hack and slasher about like an ancient swordsman it was a sequel to a game that apparently didn't do too well in the first place Space Station Silicon Valley on the N64 it was kind of a whimsical little platformer robot animal type of game that just got lost in the whole N64 not being one of Nintendo's greatest systems Panzer Dragoon Orta from 2003 is on the list that was a good game

1779
02:16:06,744 --> 02:16:10,086
[SPEAKER_08]: The Last Express Bionic Commando

1780
02:16:28,137 --> 02:16:29,198
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1781
02:16:49,895 --> 02:16:53,616
[SPEAKER_08]: Grim Fandango, also on the list, getting down towards the end here.

1782
02:16:53,656 --> 02:16:56,576
[SPEAKER_08]: The Neverhood, from 1996, on the list.

1783
02:16:56,956 --> 02:17:01,777
[SPEAKER_08]: And last but not least, Okami made the list, which isn't surprising at all.

1784
02:17:02,217 --> 02:17:08,258
[SPEAKER_08]: And the reason why Okami kind of got burned, it was out on the PlayStation 2, kind of when the next generation of games was already starting.

1785
02:17:08,518 --> 02:17:11,339
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, and the PS2 was already dying out for a lot of hardcore gamers.

1786
02:17:11,639 --> 02:17:13,659
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that was one of the biggest problems with Final Fantasy XII.

1787
02:17:13,739 --> 02:17:14,659
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it came out too late.

1788
02:17:15,419 --> 02:17:18,020
[SPEAKER_08]: And by the time Final Fantasy XII came out, it should have been on the next-gen system.

1789
02:17:19,020 --> 02:17:20,121
[SPEAKER_08]: But that's just me.

1790
02:17:21,902 --> 02:17:22,242
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright.

1791
02:17:23,603 --> 02:17:28,646
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess we're getting to that part of the show where we're going to open up the Skype line and hear from you guys.

1792
02:17:28,666 --> 02:17:34,610
[SPEAKER_08]: 1-877-GAME-OLR is the number you want to call if you want to get on the show or you can just Skype us directly at Orange Lounge Radio.

1793
02:17:35,010 --> 02:17:36,571
[SPEAKER_08]: I do want to give a little disclaimer first.

1794
02:17:36,591 --> 02:17:40,653
[SPEAKER_08]: We've been having problems with Skype the past couple weeks where we've been randomly hanging up on callers.

1795
02:17:41,013 --> 02:17:43,235
[SPEAKER_08]: We did upgrade to a new version of Skype.

1796
02:17:43,895 --> 02:17:45,555
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1797
02:18:13,961 --> 02:18:14,982
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1798
02:18:36,812 --> 02:18:38,454
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?

1799
02:18:38,474 --> 02:18:40,175
[SPEAKER_03]: Hola, bienvenidos a Orange Launch Radio, quien es?

1800
02:19:05,063 --> 02:19:12,367
[SPEAKER_08]: Remember, you should always check your microphone connection calling Echo 123 on Skype before you give us a call.

1801
02:19:12,427 --> 02:19:13,648
[SPEAKER_08]: Otherwise, it may not work.

1802
02:19:13,908 --> 02:19:15,629
[SPEAKER_08]: But I could swear I heard somebody breathing there.

1803
02:19:15,809 --> 02:19:17,250
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe they just couldn't hear us for some reason.

1804
02:19:17,770 --> 02:19:17,970
[SPEAKER_08]: Huh?

1805
02:19:18,170 --> 02:19:18,951
[SPEAKER_08]: I heard someone breathing.

1806
02:19:19,051 --> 02:19:19,551
[SPEAKER_08]: I could too.

1807
02:19:19,671 --> 02:19:21,052
[SPEAKER_08]: So I don't know what the hell was going on there.

1808
02:19:21,652 --> 02:19:23,333
[SPEAKER_08]: So somebody was not paying attention.

1809
02:19:24,854 --> 02:19:25,655
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't know what happened there.

1810
02:19:27,296 --> 02:19:29,257
[SPEAKER_08]: Do we have any other... Actually, here we go.

1811
02:19:29,277 --> 02:19:30,077
[SPEAKER_08]: We got another call coming in.

1812
02:19:30,558 --> 02:19:31,618
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1813
02:19:31,638 --> 02:19:32,038
[SPEAKER_08]: Who's this?

1814
02:19:33,619 --> 02:19:34,260
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, it's Mr.

1815
02:19:36,038 --> 02:19:37,858
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, SSJ100 Matt, how are you?

1816
02:19:39,359 --> 02:19:40,159
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm doing good.

1817
02:19:40,279 --> 02:19:42,319
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm doing well, actually.

1818
02:19:42,359 --> 02:19:43,540
[SPEAKER_08]: You're cutting out a little bit.

1819
02:19:43,580 --> 02:19:45,620
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know what's going on, but what are you up to tonight?

1820
02:19:47,141 --> 02:19:50,961
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually, I just got out of Video Games Live.

1821
02:19:51,662 --> 02:19:53,142
[SPEAKER_08]: Video Games Live?

1822
02:19:53,182 --> 02:19:54,342
[SPEAKER_08]: Was it in New York City tonight?

1823
02:19:55,703 --> 02:19:56,143
It was.

1824
02:19:56,663 --> 02:19:57,463
[SPEAKER_08]: How was the show?

1825
02:19:59,943 --> 02:20:00,704
[SPEAKER_06]: It was great.

1826
02:20:00,724 --> 02:20:01,404
[SPEAKER_06]: I went to other...

1827
02:20:02,652 --> 02:20:07,656
[SPEAKER_06]: I went to the Dear Friends concert a while back when it was done, and this was a lot better.

1828
02:20:07,716 --> 02:20:09,518
[SPEAKER_06]: This is the first one I did.

1829
02:20:09,538 --> 02:20:12,640
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I think the best one was when he did the encore, it was Chrono Trigger.

1830
02:20:31,689 --> 02:20:31,990
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh-huh.

1831
02:20:32,070 --> 02:20:32,270
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh-huh.

1832
02:20:44,135 --> 02:20:48,316
[SPEAKER_08]: And I just want to point out, we realize SSJ100Mad is breaking up.

1833
02:20:48,376 --> 02:20:49,957
[SPEAKER_08]: His connection is kind of crap.

1834
02:20:50,017 --> 02:20:56,058
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know if that's because of the new Skype or what's going on, but we're going to try and get through this because I want to talk about Video Games Live a little bit.

1835
02:20:56,078 --> 02:21:00,599
[SPEAKER_08]: The Chrono Trigger piece, we were there the night that debuted in Oakland.

1836
02:21:00,619 --> 02:21:03,000
[SPEAKER_08]: That was an awesome night, so a good piece.

1837
02:21:03,060 --> 02:21:05,200
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm glad that came out.

1838
02:21:06,121 --> 02:21:07,021
[SPEAKER_08]: Any lowlights?

1839
02:21:07,201 --> 02:21:11,762
[SPEAKER_08]: Were there songs that they were playing where you were kind of like, they could have bumped this for something else?

1840
02:21:16,146 --> 02:21:16,686
[SPEAKER_06]: Not really.

1841
02:21:16,746 --> 02:21:26,612
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it was cool that they brought in Mega Man, which I don't think they brought in previous shows.

1842
02:21:27,653 --> 02:21:36,798
[SPEAKER_06]: But to Jamie's surprise, they did play Castlevania songs.

1843
02:21:37,899 --> 02:21:39,059
[SPEAKER_08]: Did they have any guests show up?

1844
02:21:39,100 --> 02:21:41,321
[SPEAKER_08]: Because sometimes they have random guests show up at these things.

1845
02:21:43,406 --> 02:21:49,828
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, they did have a kid from YouTube that played Mario songs blindfolded.

1846
02:21:50,548 --> 02:21:51,309
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, on the piano?

1847
02:21:51,369 --> 02:21:52,629
[SPEAKER_08]: He was there when we went.

1848
02:21:52,649 --> 02:21:54,690
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I think Tommy has him on the payroll or something.

1849
02:21:54,730 --> 02:21:55,570
[SPEAKER_08]: He follows him everywhere.

1850
02:21:56,690 --> 02:21:56,930
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

1851
02:21:57,551 --> 02:22:06,013
[SPEAKER_06]: And also, they called in, I'm trying to think of his name, Ross Baer, the creator of Pong.

1852
02:22:06,874 --> 02:22:07,354
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, nice.

1853
02:22:09,134 --> 02:22:11,055
[SPEAKER_06]: So, that was interesting.

1854
02:22:11,718 --> 02:22:12,678
[SPEAKER_08]: Take care, buddy.

1855
02:22:12,698 --> 02:22:12,878
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1856
02:22:12,898 --> 02:22:13,098
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's see.

1857
02:22:39,759 --> 02:22:43,961
[SPEAKER_08]: Moving on to more calls and more last-minute stories here on Orange Lounge Radio.

1858
02:22:44,021 --> 02:22:48,643
[SPEAKER_08]: I hope that was just an isolated thing and not something that's going to continue.

1859
02:22:49,163 --> 02:22:49,543
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll see.

1860
02:22:50,504 --> 02:22:51,384
[SPEAKER_08]: He said he was somewhere.

1861
02:22:51,604 --> 02:22:51,864
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

1862
02:22:51,884 --> 02:22:52,464
[SPEAKER_08]: He was cutting out.

1863
02:22:52,484 --> 02:22:54,265
[SPEAKER_08]: I think he said he was at a game or something, so we'll see.

1864
02:22:54,805 --> 02:22:56,066
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll try to get a couple more calls here.

1865
02:22:56,086 --> 02:22:57,546
[SPEAKER_08]: 877-GAME-OLR.

1866
02:22:57,646 --> 02:22:59,007
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki, do you have any other last-minute stories?

1867
02:22:59,147 --> 02:23:00,108
[SPEAKER_03]: DS Master 25 What's on your mind?

1868
02:23:24,171 --> 02:23:26,672
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, kind of a sad story today.

1869
02:23:28,052 --> 02:23:28,492
[SPEAKER_04]: What's that?

1870
02:23:28,512 --> 02:23:31,733
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1871
02:23:33,294 --> 02:23:37,275
[SPEAKER_04]: As soon as I get done... What the hell is going on?

1872
02:23:37,335 --> 02:23:38,095
[SPEAKER_08]: Is there an argument?

1873
02:23:38,155 --> 02:23:39,755
[SPEAKER_08]: Is somebody breaking a dish behind you?

1874
02:23:39,815 --> 02:23:40,516
[SPEAKER_08]: What is going on?

1875
02:23:41,256 --> 02:23:41,876
[SPEAKER_04]: My mother.

1876
02:23:42,476 --> 02:23:43,196
[SPEAKER_08]: Is she yelling at you?

1877
02:23:43,216 --> 02:23:46,997
[SPEAKER_04]: Basically, my DS... Who are you talking to?

1878
02:23:47,358 --> 02:23:49,138
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm on the radio, Mom.

1879
02:23:49,298 --> 02:23:49,878
[SPEAKER_04]: Come on.

1880
02:23:50,498 --> 02:23:51,319
[SPEAKER_04]: It's 11 o'clock.

1881
02:23:51,399 --> 02:23:52,399
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, okay.

1882
02:23:52,459 --> 02:23:52,679
[SPEAKER_04]: Jesus.

1883
02:23:53,822 --> 02:23:58,983
[SPEAKER_04]: Basically, the L button on my DSI died, and it's only been like a few months.

1884
02:24:00,564 --> 02:24:03,444
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't know if any of our listeners have had that problem.

1885
02:24:05,785 --> 02:24:07,705
[SPEAKER_08]: Is your mom mad that you're calling in so late?

1886
02:24:09,046 --> 02:24:09,646
[SPEAKER_04]: Probably.

1887
02:24:10,046 --> 02:24:12,286
[SPEAKER_08]: You shouldn't say Jesus in front of your mother like that.

1888
02:24:12,927 --> 02:24:14,427
[SPEAKER_08]: That's usually frowned upon, just so you know.

1889
02:24:18,388 --> 02:24:45,095
[SPEAKER_08]: you realize your whole call has just been shot because now everybody's just saying mom I'm on the radio sorry but basically my DSI the stupid L button stopped working in the middle of 3D pinball of all things I'm sorry to hear it but mom's not going to buy you a new one if you keep staying up late to call stupid internet radio programs

1890
02:24:46,141 --> 02:24:48,623
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, anyways, I do have a good game review, though.

1891
02:24:49,063 --> 02:24:49,544
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, please.

1892
02:24:49,724 --> 02:24:52,807
[SPEAKER_04]: Kingdom Hearts, Jaren Fitgate, over two days.

1893
02:24:54,108 --> 02:25:05,457
[SPEAKER_04]: I will say here, I've been a long-time Square fan, even though I kind of despised them on the first Kingdom Hearts, because I'm like, what the hell are you thinking, Square?

1894
02:25:06,038 --> 02:25:06,999
[SPEAKER_04]: Combining with Disney?

1895
02:25:07,139 --> 02:25:07,919
[SPEAKER_04]: You're stupid.

1896
02:25:09,281 --> 02:25:13,264
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you know, and then a friend told me, don't knock it till you try it.

1897
02:25:13,834 --> 02:25:16,675
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, and I fell in love with this series right then and there.

1898
02:25:17,715 --> 02:25:22,137
[SPEAKER_04]: And when Kairi left, I kind of cried.

1899
02:25:23,598 --> 02:25:31,080
[SPEAKER_04]: And basically now I'm still on the search for in this one, which is supposed to be the real link between 1 and 2.

1900
02:25:31,160 --> 02:25:35,622
[SPEAKER_04]: So unfortunately I had to sell my PlayStation 2 off because of the overdraft.

1901
02:25:36,482 --> 02:25:41,524
[SPEAKER_04]: But I'm planning on getting one again just to play the rest of the Kingdom Hearts series again.

1902
02:25:43,533 --> 02:25:45,454
[SPEAKER_08]: Your mom didn't see you crying in a video game, did she?

1903
02:25:47,014 --> 02:25:51,215
[SPEAKER_04]: No, my girlfriend did, though, and she kind of cried along.

1904
02:25:51,235 --> 02:25:54,356
[SPEAKER_04]: She's like, no, Kyrie, don't leave.

1905
02:25:54,436 --> 02:25:55,237
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, that's okay.

1906
02:25:55,297 --> 02:25:58,538
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, chicks seeing you cry, that just scores you points with them.

1907
02:25:58,558 --> 02:26:00,758
[SPEAKER_08]: But you don't want your mom to see you cry because then she thinks you're a wimp.

1908
02:26:00,778 --> 02:26:01,178
[SPEAKER_08]: That's right.

1909
02:26:03,119 --> 02:26:09,161
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I'm surprised my father is already bashing the whole Hannah Montana stuff and saying, at least you're playing good music.

1910
02:26:10,681 --> 02:26:12,422
[SPEAKER_08]: Wait, are you a Hannah Montana fan?

1911
02:26:13,843 --> 02:26:16,485
[SPEAKER_04]: I was the one who sent in that angry message.

1912
02:26:16,585 --> 02:26:18,847
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, remember, leave Hannah alone.

1913
02:26:19,368 --> 02:26:20,348
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you guys remember that?

1914
02:26:21,309 --> 02:26:22,710
[SPEAKER_04]: I try every day to forget.

1915
02:26:24,612 --> 02:26:25,393
[SPEAKER_04]: Episode 271.

1916
02:26:25,553 --> 02:26:29,015
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, don't look it up.

1917
02:26:29,056 --> 02:26:29,576
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't remember.

1918
02:26:29,596 --> 02:26:31,437
[SPEAKER_03]: That would have only been like two years ago.

1919
02:26:31,578 --> 02:26:31,978
[SPEAKER_08]: That's all right.

1920
02:26:32,338 --> 02:26:32,638
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1921
02:26:32,859 --> 02:26:34,020
[SPEAKER_03]: This isn't going to get any better.

1922
02:26:34,040 --> 02:26:37,182
[SPEAKER_08]: DS Master 25 or 26 or whoever you are.

1923
02:26:37,242 --> 02:26:37,963
[SPEAKER_08]: We've got to wrap up.

1924
02:26:38,023 --> 02:26:39,464
[SPEAKER_08]: It's way past your bedtime, young man.

1925
02:26:39,824 --> 02:26:41,586
[SPEAKER_08]: But any other last minute thoughts before we let you go?

1926
02:26:43,642 --> 02:26:47,244
[SPEAKER_04]: Beatmania 2DX17 for PS3 is going to rock.

1927
02:26:47,505 --> 02:26:49,005
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm importing it with a PS3.

1928
02:26:49,065 --> 02:26:50,426
[SPEAKER_04]: That's indefinite.

1929
02:26:50,446 --> 02:26:50,686
[SPEAKER_08]: Bye.

1930
02:26:50,806 --> 02:26:51,006
[SPEAKER_08]: Perfect.

1931
02:26:51,027 --> 02:26:51,227
[SPEAKER_08]: Later.

1932
02:26:51,247 --> 02:26:51,527
[SPEAKER_08]: Go to bed.

1933
02:26:51,547 --> 02:26:51,607
[SPEAKER_08]: Wow.

1934
02:26:51,627 --> 02:26:51,967
[SPEAKER_08]: That's like

1935
02:27:02,358 --> 02:27:07,402
[SPEAKER_03]: and then it got worse and then it got worse.

1936
02:27:07,422 --> 02:27:09,103
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to admit that call was pretty epic.

1937
02:27:09,143 --> 02:27:10,104
[SPEAKER_03]: That was pretty awesome.

1938
02:27:10,985 --> 02:27:11,405
[SPEAKER_03]: It was cool.

1939
02:27:11,465 --> 02:27:13,407
[SPEAKER_08]: I kind of feel bad for him, but that's all right.

1940
02:27:14,227 --> 02:27:15,448
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1941
02:27:15,488 --> 02:27:15,909
[SPEAKER_08]: Who's this?

1942
02:27:17,650 --> 02:27:23,514
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello, this is Ray or Ray Force, whatever you go on in Orange Lounge Radio.

1943
02:27:23,735 --> 02:27:24,455
[SPEAKER_05]: What's up, Ray?

1944
02:27:24,715 --> 02:27:25,276
[SPEAKER_08]: What's on your mind?

1945
02:27:26,537 --> 02:27:26,757
[SPEAKER_08]: Hmm.

1946
02:27:27,406 --> 02:27:32,530
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, this past week, I managed to get my hands on a Street Fighter 4 5-in-6 tournament edition.

1947
02:27:32,550 --> 02:27:35,272
[SPEAKER_05]: It had a big stick with the real arcade parts.

1948
02:27:35,912 --> 02:27:36,233
[SPEAKER_02]: Mm-hmm.

1949
02:27:37,994 --> 02:27:38,715
[SPEAKER_05]: And what did you think?

1950
02:27:38,735 --> 02:27:46,040
[SPEAKER_05]: So, I thought... I was playing mostly, like, shooter-type games, like... Riding Fires and such with it.

1951
02:27:46,180 --> 02:27:55,247
[SPEAKER_05]: It takes some time getting used to it, especially with the square well, but... Instead of, like, having an octagonal well or a circular one, but once you get used to it, like... Playing a...

1952
02:27:57,177 --> 02:28:00,420
[SPEAKER_05]: How expensive is this thing?

1953
02:28:00,480 --> 02:28:08,765
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess that kind of stuff tends to go down in price, though, after just a little bit of time.

1954
02:28:08,825 --> 02:28:11,968
[SPEAKER_05]: Because haven't those been out a little while?

1955
02:28:27,389 --> 02:28:28,030
[SPEAKER_08]: Since February.

1956
02:28:28,070 --> 02:28:33,639
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, they've been out for nearly a year now, and I believe the friars around me are starting to run out of them.

1957
02:28:36,505 --> 02:28:38,707
[SPEAKER_08]: Honestly, if you're going to build your own, it's a lot cheaper.

1958
02:28:39,027 --> 02:28:39,267
[SPEAKER_08]: Really?

1959
02:28:39,327 --> 02:28:40,988
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I actually thought about getting one of those.

1960
02:28:41,148 --> 02:28:43,690
[SPEAKER_08]: I think we're thinking of the same device.

1961
02:28:43,950 --> 02:28:45,371
[SPEAKER_08]: I was thinking about getting one of those a while ago.

1962
02:28:45,571 --> 02:28:54,738
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you can basically, if you get the encoder board for it, which they're not that expensive, the actual buttons and everything, it'll cost anything.

1963
02:28:54,798 --> 02:28:55,418
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not you.

1964
02:28:55,518 --> 02:28:56,839
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't build my own stuff.

1965
02:28:56,879 --> 02:28:57,720
[SPEAKER_03]: Would I be able to do this?

1966
02:28:57,740 --> 02:28:58,060
[SPEAKER_03]: It plugs in.

1967
02:28:58,120 --> 02:28:59,041
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, my God.

1968
02:28:59,862 --> 02:29:00,282
[SPEAKER_03]: Switch.

1969
02:29:00,982 --> 02:29:01,343
[SPEAKER_03]: Fine.

1970
02:29:02,003 --> 02:29:02,603
[SPEAKER_08]: It's simple.

1971
02:29:02,623 --> 02:29:03,504
[SPEAKER_08]: You'd be surprised.

1972
02:29:04,505 --> 02:29:05,365
[SPEAKER_08]: Be very surprised.

1973
02:29:05,506 --> 02:29:05,966
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1974
02:29:07,082 --> 02:29:08,243
[SPEAKER_08]: So, Ray, was it worth the money?

1975
02:29:10,604 --> 02:29:11,524
[SPEAKER_08]: Was it worth the money?

1976
02:29:23,289 --> 02:29:29,572
[SPEAKER_08]: What I kind of like about what you're saying is that you're not actually using this to play Street Fighter 4, but that you're using it to play, like, other games, like shooters and stuff.

1977
02:29:29,912 --> 02:29:33,054
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I think, seriously, if I were to get one of these, I'd actually use it to play, like, Soul Calibur.

1978
02:29:34,878 --> 02:29:36,920
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I suck horribly at fighters.

1979
02:29:37,000 --> 02:29:43,027
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I'm mostly, I'm a schmuck person first, and a fighting game person, like, way further down.

1980
02:29:47,051 --> 02:29:47,912
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think it's worth it.

1981
02:29:49,714 --> 02:29:49,994
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright.

1982
02:29:50,835 --> 02:29:54,178
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, buddy, do you have anything else you want to talk about tonight?

1983
02:29:54,279 --> 02:29:55,460
[SPEAKER_08]: Any other games you've been playing lately?

1984
02:29:56,827 --> 02:30:01,489
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm playing Space Invaders Extreme too, but I haven't played it for long, so I'll probably call in by next week.

1985
02:30:01,989 --> 02:30:02,529
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, please do.

1986
02:30:02,569 --> 02:30:05,090
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm very curious to hear about that game, because I did enjoy the first one.

1987
02:30:05,110 --> 02:30:06,550
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to hear about what's new in the second one.

1988
02:30:08,331 --> 02:30:12,313
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I'll have that later when there's more time to talk.

1989
02:30:12,653 --> 02:30:17,574
[SPEAKER_05]: Most of my calls this time are on my arcade stick, so any other people who can't be called.

1990
02:30:17,794 --> 02:30:18,635
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll arrange something.

1991
02:30:20,215 --> 02:30:20,495
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

1992
02:30:20,715 --> 02:30:21,536
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, take care, buddy.

1993
02:30:21,736 --> 02:30:23,236
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, hey, you're in the Bay Area.

1994
02:30:23,336 --> 02:30:24,777
[SPEAKER_08]: Any chance we're going to see you at Umlaut?

1995
02:30:27,056 --> 02:30:27,897
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not sure.

1996
02:30:29,377 --> 02:30:33,279
[SPEAKER_05]: If on a Wednesday, I'm not sure if I'll be able to make it on Thursday.

1997
02:30:33,299 --> 02:30:34,720
[SPEAKER_05]: That's past 9 a.m.

1998
02:30:35,440 --> 02:30:37,801
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's in San Jose, not San Francisco.

1999
02:30:38,262 --> 02:30:38,882
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, yeah, that's right.

2000
02:30:39,262 --> 02:30:40,003
[SPEAKER_08]: You're in the South Bay.

2001
02:30:40,383 --> 02:30:41,123
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, we'll see.

2002
02:30:41,583 --> 02:30:42,324
[SPEAKER_08]: It is a weeknight.

2003
02:30:42,364 --> 02:30:42,824
[SPEAKER_08]: That's tough.

2004
02:30:42,884 --> 02:30:46,186
[SPEAKER_08]: But hopefully we'll see some of our Bay Area friends able to get up there.

2005
02:30:46,346 --> 02:30:47,526
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's going to be a fun night.

2006
02:30:47,946 --> 02:30:48,347
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, buddy.

2007
02:30:48,367 --> 02:30:48,907
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks for calling.

2008
02:30:50,319 --> 02:30:51,240
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, see ya Later

2009
02:31:12,059 --> 02:31:16,846
[SPEAKER_03]: Just real quick, there's a new indie game that's on Xbox Live Indie Games called Pumpkin Shop.

2010
02:31:17,306 --> 02:31:22,433
[SPEAKER_03]: And yes, this would be the perfect time of the year to release a pumpkin carving sim.

2011
02:31:22,954 --> 02:31:28,922
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can do just that without the mess and have your own virtual pumpkin that no one can smash against your porch.

2012
02:31:30,663 --> 02:31:33,546
[SPEAKER_03]: No word on how expensive that is, but that is called Pumpkin Shop.

2013
02:31:33,747 --> 02:31:35,068
[SPEAKER_03]: Sounds a little ridiculous to me.

2014
02:31:35,309 --> 02:31:35,789
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks neat.

2015
02:31:35,829 --> 02:31:37,952
[SPEAKER_03]: It'd be cool if you could share it with your friends.

2016
02:31:37,972 --> 02:31:39,674
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want to carve a pumpkin, carve a pumpkin.

2017
02:31:40,455 --> 02:31:46,462
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm surprised there's not a Facebook app to do that and you share it with your friends so that you get annoying little notices and stuff.

2018
02:31:46,542 --> 02:31:48,324
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I'm kind of surprised there isn't that too.

2019
02:31:48,344 --> 02:31:49,806
[SPEAKER_08]: But now that you said it, there'll probably be one.

2020
02:31:52,162 --> 02:31:52,462
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that it?

2021
02:31:52,783 --> 02:31:57,628
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a shame that there's not millions of dollars coming into my mailbox each day because that would be tragic.

2022
02:31:57,848 --> 02:31:58,089
[SPEAKER_03]: I know.

2023
02:31:58,129 --> 02:31:59,210
[SPEAKER_08]: You could start your own game company.

2024
02:31:59,270 --> 02:32:02,574
[SPEAKER_08]: Release the pumpkin carving Facebook app.

2025
02:32:02,634 --> 02:32:03,735
[SPEAKER_08]: Release President Cat.

2026
02:32:04,135 --> 02:32:05,237
[SPEAKER_08]: You'd be a rich man.

2027
02:32:05,857 --> 02:32:07,539
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see what we can do with President Cat.

2028
02:32:07,579 --> 02:32:09,982
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's just a matter of giving... That sounds like a threat.

2029
02:32:11,738 --> 02:32:12,258
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

2030
02:32:33,131 --> 02:32:37,973
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't release that many games a year, so I think that their budget might be really low.

2031
02:32:38,293 --> 02:32:45,976
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd say both them and UFO Interactive would be good candidates to bug about releasing the game over here.

2032
02:32:47,257 --> 02:32:52,059
[SPEAKER_03]: And then followed by maybe... I'm not sure about Ignition or...

2033
02:32:54,830 --> 02:32:55,631
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, who was the other one?

2034
02:32:56,332 --> 02:33:01,037
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, like Ignition, because they really only release certain types of games over here.

2035
02:33:01,197 --> 02:33:03,379
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, really a lot of the RPGs and that kind of stuff.

2036
02:33:03,799 --> 02:33:05,561
[SPEAKER_03]: So that wouldn't really fit with them.

2037
02:33:05,701 --> 02:33:09,706
[SPEAKER_03]: But Axis Game Localization, man, it's all sorts of weird shit.

2038
02:33:11,488 --> 02:33:17,272
[SPEAKER_03]: Graffiti Interactive would be good too, but they're really low budget and it takes forever for them to get stuff out.

2039
02:33:17,392 --> 02:33:20,113
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, if you guys send out emails out there, we definitely want to see.

2040
02:33:20,253 --> 02:33:22,495
[SPEAKER_08]: Send your responses, the responses you get back from companies.

2041
02:33:22,555 --> 02:33:23,195
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll post something.

2042
02:33:23,355 --> 02:33:23,955
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll post something.

2043
02:33:24,416 --> 02:33:29,859
[SPEAKER_03]: If there's a thread in our forums for it, we'll post the information of where we need to go with that.

2044
02:33:30,419 --> 02:33:37,823
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, I loved the excuse me, I loved the way people used the photo stream last week to show pictures of President Cat and their fan art.

2045
02:33:38,243 --> 02:33:42,226
[SPEAKER_08]: So I would like to encourage people this week, you know, we're still a little bit on our President Cat kick.

2046
02:33:42,266 --> 02:33:43,686
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll think of a new theme maybe next week.

2047
02:33:44,147 --> 02:33:50,490
[SPEAKER_08]: But continuing on that, I would really like to see in the photo stream and email your pics to pics at orange lingerie dot com.

2048
02:33:50,770 --> 02:33:52,671
[SPEAKER_08]: They go right up on our website when you do that.

2049
02:33:52,751 --> 02:33:58,615
[SPEAKER_08]: So, you know, I would like to see conceptual box art for this game if released in the U.S.

2050
02:33:59,215 --> 02:33:59,996
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2051
02:34:21,255 --> 02:34:30,398
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe an online petition might not hurt because at least it shows, okay, look, there's a few hundred people interested in getting this game over here to see what we can do.

2052
02:34:30,418 --> 02:34:35,780
[SPEAKER_03]: It gives people focus to make their mark or something like that, and we'll go from there.

2053
02:34:36,721 --> 02:34:37,021
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

2054
02:34:37,801 --> 02:34:41,722
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, if that's it for Last Minute Stories tonight, then we're going to go around and get everybody's final thoughts.

2055
02:34:41,983 --> 02:34:44,563
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, your final thought tonight.

2056
02:34:44,944 --> 02:34:45,984
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki, your final thought tonight.

2057
02:34:47,469 --> 02:34:54,881
[SPEAKER_03]: my final thought is I have my arcade cabinet in my house and now I gotta finish it my final thought is I want chicken

2058
02:34:55,984 --> 02:35:00,126
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll play a loco to be exact, which reminds me of this week's episode of South Park, which is kind of funny.

2059
02:35:00,426 --> 02:35:03,807
[SPEAKER_08]: So anyhow, that's going to do it for this week's episode of Orange Launch Radio.

2060
02:35:03,847 --> 02:35:07,369
[SPEAKER_08]: Just a word to the wise out there, those folks that are listening live.

2061
02:35:07,949 --> 02:35:10,270
[SPEAKER_08]: We have Daylight Savings Time kicking in next week.

2062
02:35:10,330 --> 02:35:13,191
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's spring forward, fall back.

2063
02:35:13,591 --> 02:35:15,912
[SPEAKER_08]: So we will be moving the clocks back an hour here.

2064
02:35:15,972 --> 02:35:19,694
[SPEAKER_08]: So if you don't celebrate Daylight Savings Time in your country or where you are.

2065
02:35:19,714 --> 02:35:20,954
[SPEAKER_08]: We're looking at you, Arizona.

2066
02:35:20,974 --> 02:35:22,235
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, please plan accordingly.

2067
02:35:22,935 --> 02:35:24,016
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it's Arizona that doesn't have it.

2068
02:35:24,056 --> 02:35:27,417
[SPEAKER_08]: So please plan accordingly for those of you folks that don't have daylight savings time.

2069
02:35:28,738 --> 02:35:30,779
[SPEAKER_08]: And my – I guess that was it.

2070
02:35:31,599 --> 02:35:32,720
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I get my final thought.

2071
02:35:32,820 --> 02:35:33,360
[SPEAKER_08]: We're good to go.

2072
02:35:33,860 --> 02:35:38,403
[SPEAKER_08]: I always like to say also if you enjoyed Orange Lounge Radio, please tell two friends about the show.

2073
02:35:38,723 --> 02:35:42,425
[SPEAKER_08]: Help spread the word because remember we have no big magazine backing us up.

2074
02:35:42,505 --> 02:35:44,546
[SPEAKER_08]: We have no advertising dollars.

2075
02:35:44,606 --> 02:35:45,967
[SPEAKER_08]: We rely strictly on word of mouth.

2076
02:35:46,007 --> 02:35:47,427
[SPEAKER_08]: We do the show for free, no ads.

2077
02:35:47,868 --> 02:35:48,608
[SPEAKER_08]: So, you know.

2078
02:35:49,073 --> 02:35:50,574
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not even 9 o'clock yet.

2079
02:35:50,794 --> 02:35:51,034
[SPEAKER_08]: I know.

2080
02:35:51,074 --> 02:35:52,675
[SPEAKER_08]: It's kind of early tonight.

2081
02:35:52,715 --> 02:35:53,055
[SPEAKER_08]: Not really.

2082
02:35:53,095 --> 02:35:55,796
[SPEAKER_08]: It's still been an almost three-hour show, maybe two and a half.

2083
02:35:56,316 --> 02:35:57,457
[SPEAKER_08]: But it's time to wrap it up.

2084
02:35:58,017 --> 02:35:58,637
[SPEAKER_08]: Get on out of here.

2085
02:35:59,198 --> 02:35:59,898
[SPEAKER_08]: Have a good night, everybody.

2086
02:35:59,918 --> 02:36:00,678
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll see you next week.

2087
02:36:00,698 --> 02:36:04,340
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll be back with more of Orange Lounge Radio on November 1st.

2088
02:36:05,100 --> 02:36:06,861
[SPEAKER_08]: I can't believe it's almost the end of the year already.

2089
02:36:06,941 --> 02:36:09,002
[SPEAKER_08]: We're getting into the very, very busy game season.

2090
02:36:09,282 --> 02:36:13,104
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll see you next time here on Orange Lounge Radio.

2091
02:36:14,358 --> 02:36:17,140
[SPEAKER_00]: You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

2092
02:36:17,641 --> 02:36:20,883
[SPEAKER_00]: Orange Lounge Radio is an Orange Lounge production.

2093
02:36:21,323 --> 02:36:29,990
[SPEAKER_00]: To join us for a live show, visit www.allgames.com Sunday nights at 6pm Pacific Time.

2094
02:36:30,470 --> 02:36:42,079
[SPEAKER_00]: The views and opinions expressed on Orange Lounge Radio do not necessarily reflect those of the entire staff of Orange Lounge Radio or allgames.com, but we're probably right anyway.

2095
02:36:42,639 --> 02:36:43,480
[SPEAKER_00]: See you next week!
