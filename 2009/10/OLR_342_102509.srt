00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Music

2
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Tonight, October 25th, 2009, a major new score burns computer games while you wait.

3
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
We have an interview about the upcoming charity event, Ooh Loud,

4
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
and some crappy little podcast once an obscure Japanese title released in the US.

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Orange Lounge Radio

6
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Music

7
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Heard any good jokes lately?

8
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Hi, and welcome to another edition of Orange Lounge Radio.

9
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:05,000
That's a podcast dedicated to video games, video gaming, gamer lifestyle, and of course, kittens!

10
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Cute, adorable, fluffy kittens.

11
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
My name is Rob Roberts, joining you for the next few hours.

12
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Of course, as with me as always, say hello to the one and only secretary of catnip,

13
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.

14
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:28,000
And of course, the one and only secretary of defense, Techmaster Loki.

15
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Hello.

16
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
He cleans the cat box.

17
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I do.

18
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
How are you guys doing tonight?

19
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
It's been an interesting week.

20
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Been a very interesting week.

21
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
It's been a unique week.

22
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
It's been a very unique week here at Orange Lounge Radio.

23
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I have to say, in the seven and a half years we've been doing Orange Lounge Radio,

24
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I haven't quite seen anything like it.

25
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Usually at Orange Lounge Radio, we start off the show talking about our gaming weeks,

26
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,000
but in spite of things going on, we thought we might change that up a little bit

27
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
and start off tonight with some news.

28
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
And we're going to head over to Joystiq with a Q.

29
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Of course, we like them over at Joystiq.

30
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
They run lots of fun little game stories.

31
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
They ran a story this week.

32
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Fans campaigning for President Cat.

33
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I love that picture.

34
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Against all odds, a completely random Japanese Wii game starring a cat blogger

35
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
has become a hot topic among some fans.

36
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Sukiban Sachurena Wii stars a cat named Rena from a popular Japanese blog

37
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
as the CEO of Cat Queen, Inc.

38
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
You play as a cat going through the initiation into the company,

39
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
performing various minigames to earn Rena's respect.

40
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
That's not really true.

41
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Oh, really?

42
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
You don't play a cat.

43
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Oh, what?

44
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
You play a person.

45
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Oh, really now?

46
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Yes.

47
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
How do you know this?

48
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Because you see the person in the game that you're playing.

49
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
You dodge flying cats.

50
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
I see.

51
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
The Orange Lounge Radio podcast discovered the game,

52
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
which they have dubbed President Cat.

53
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I like that, that we just dubbed it that.

54
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Hey, they like it.

55
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I shall call it President Cat.

56
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Hey, they like it.

57
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
They did.

58
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Then began tweeting the Wii game's official account.

59
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Fans started sending messages of encouragement and support

60
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
to the President Cat hashtag,

61
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
and the Rena account has started responding in both Japanese and English,

62
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,000
revealing that the publisher is excited and a little confused

63
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
about all this sudden attention.

64
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,000
It would be hilarious if this grassroots movement resulted in the localization

65
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
of a weird licensed game.

66
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,000
However, it would also be pretty sad if the publisher turned out to lose money on it.

67
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
It's definitely something we want to play,

68
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
but we're not exactly representative of the mainstream audience.

69
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:33,000
That story coming from J.C. Fletcher over at Joystick.

70
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I want to dodge flying cats.

71
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Obviously, we're a little surprised, probably like most people,

72
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
that this actually made game blogs this week.

73
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
A number of them.

74
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Some people might think it was a grab for attention,

75
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
but no, please.

76
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
We've done far worse desperate cries for attention on this show in the past.

77
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
This was nothing.

78
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:58,000
What's also interesting about this is that it's not like this is the first game

79
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
we've ever said they should bring over from Japan.

80
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,000
This is the first one that we've actually contacted the company roundaboutly.

81
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Kind of.

82
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Think about what the show was based on, what we started the show on.

83
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
DDR, right?

84
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Yeah.

85
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:15,000
How long did it take for DDR to finally come from Japan to the U.S.?

86
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Did we have Twitter back then?

87
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
No, we didn't.

88
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
So?

89
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Yeah, so certainly Twitter's changed things up a little bit.

90
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
You know, and all the obscure Japanese title we talked about in the past.

91
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
So it's interesting, you know,

92
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:30,000
and I understand why Joystick is saying what they do at the end there.

93
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
They have to kind of show both ends of the story that, you know,

94
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
well, it would be a darn shame if they localized this game

95
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
and it ended up in bargain bins.

96
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:40,000
But dude, the fact that you guys ran the article as well as a variety

97
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
of other sites ran the article.

98
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Like Go Nintendo and Destructoid.

99
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Means that people obviously saw something in it, I think.

100
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,000
You know, that wasn't in some of the games we talked about in the past.

101
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
And so it's very interesting.

102
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
It just goes to show the moral of the story.

103
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
America...

104
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Loves cats.

105
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Loves cats.

106
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,000
And I'm not, when I say America, I mean collectively the world

107
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
that listens to this show, we just happen to be in America.

108
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:11,000
But, you know, our friends in Australia, Canada, Mexico, Europe,

109
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
they all fucking love cats too.

110
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:18,000
And I think it just goes to show that people would like to see a game like this.

111
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Not everybody wants to see a game like this.

112
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Of course, you look at the comments on this and, you know,

113
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
the other sites that ran the article and there's people saying,

114
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
this game looks stupid.

115
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Yeah, they probably also like Madden.

116
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,000
And my point would be there are some people that look at games like Madden

117
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
and go, well, that's stupid.

118
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Like me. I go a lot stupid to Madden.

119
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I don't think Madden is stupid.

120
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I just, it's not my kind of game.

121
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
I think it's a waste of my time.

122
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
But I bet there are people out there that would say Uncharted 2 is stupid.

123
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:49,000
This game that gets critical praise, lavish, left and right upon it.

124
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Somebody thinks it's stupid.

125
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
I don't, but, you know, somebody out there probably does.

126
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I will say it's stupid.

127
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
You haven't even played it.

128
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
No, I haven't.

129
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
You just want to be controversial.

130
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I know.

131
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
See, that's that desperate cry for attention people talk about.

132
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
It's not.

133
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
I am unique just like everyone else.

134
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
So here's the thing, though.

135
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:13,000
The point behind this, and if you go back on the show weeks and weeks,

136
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
years and years, months and months, whatever,

137
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
we've talked about this for a long time.

138
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
It has to do with risk taking.

139
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,000
For example, Konami really missed the boat when it came to making guitar

140
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
games in the U.S., didn't they?

141
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Oh, hell yeah.

142
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
They had a guitar and drum game out for years and years in Japan

143
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
that they could have released over here.

144
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
But when they did it, they did a half-assed job with it.

145
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
And same thing goes for Beatmania is that, you know,

146
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:41,000
they transferred everything in Japan, kind of figuring it would work over here,

147
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
didn't really invest a lot of time or money into it.

148
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
And so they didn't really take a big risk.

149
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
I mean, sure, they, I guess, took a little risk in putting the game out

150
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
over here, which paid off for them with DDR.

151
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Yeah.

152
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
You know.

153
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Beatmania, not so much.

154
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:00,000
But a lot of Japanese companies, I think, are afraid to take risks sometimes

155
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:05,000
because they think Americans don't get it or we're not going to get it.

156
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Well, let this past week be a lesson.

157
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,000
There's a lot of people over here that get it,

158
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
or else this story would have, nobody would have cared,

159
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
just like the past other hundred games we've talked about on the show

160
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
that should be over here.

161
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,000
I'm thinking about doing a Sharmi blog as tribute.

162
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
So, I don't know, Loki, what are your thoughts on this whole thing?

163
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
You actually got the game this week, right?

164
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Yes, I did.

165
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
And what did you think?

166
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Is it worth all our hype?

167
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Did this get out of hand, what?

168
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Well, I don't know, it may have gotten out of hand a little bit,

169
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,000
but it's a fun game, from what I can understand.

170
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Obviously, I don't get a lot of the stuff that's going on in the game

171
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
because it's all in Japanese, but the little mini-games in there are fun,

172
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:53,000
and it's funny to watch them, and it's just weird.

173
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
So, it's got that kind of appeal, and I think it'd be a little bit better

174
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
if it was in English.

175
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
How much of it is spoken?

176
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
There's a lot of it. Well, it's not really spoken,

177
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
it's just kind of in text boxes.

178
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Oh.

179
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:09,000
But, you know, it's fun.

180
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Definitely would pick it up if it came out over here.

181
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
And, you know, as I posted in Twitter and stuff,

182
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
there's been a few other cat games that have come out over here,

183
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
more like the cat-raising systems, like, you know,

184
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
the dog's kind of crap.

185
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Imagine cats, and they also have purr pals and stuff like that.

186
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,000
And you have to understand, even though a lot of people

187
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
don't get these kind of games on the Wii,

188
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
the Wii has so many units out there, it doesn't matter.

189
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
It takes such a small percentage of the people out there

190
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
to sell a lot of units of this.

191
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
For example, those other cat games.

192
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
200,000 units and 400,000 units.

193
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
And they were shit. They were absolute shit.

194
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
But people will buy anything that comes out on the Wii.

195
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
And if you put President Cat on the front of that box,

196
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
you better believe that hundreds of thousands of people

197
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,000
will pick up the game, even if it completely stunk.

198
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Which is good because this game doesn't stink,

199
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:09,000
but, you know, it's quirky and it's fun and it's got minigames in it,

200
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,000
and trust me, there's so many minigame collections,

201
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,000
party games out there, it'll fit right in.

202
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000
What do you think is the fear about putting a game like this

203
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
out in the US?

204
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
I mean, clearly the developers behind this game, who granted,

205
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
we blindsided a little bit last week,

206
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
but we kind of never thought they'd care.

207
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
So it's kind of really cool that they actually responded in the first place,

208
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,000
and I think speaks very highly of the company in the first place,

209
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
you know, despite all this.

210
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
But what do you think is the fear?

211
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
I mean, there's plenty. We read off Japanese releases every week,

212
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
and many of them don't come over here.

213
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Why do you think? Do they just think we don't get it?

214
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
It's just not the kind of game that would do well here?

215
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
What is the fear?

216
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
I think that it's just a lot of money that goes into localizing the game,

217
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
and if they don't feel that they're going to sell enough units,

218
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
then they're just not going to bother with it.

219
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:03,000
But then I look at companies like Atlus, or even Axis game localization,

220
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
or even Ignition, whatever.

221
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
I mean, a lot of their games that come out over here

222
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:12,000
that they decided to put out on the Wii, or even the DS and stuff,

223
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
don't sell that many units.

224
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Atlus especially, they don't sell a lot of units, maybe 200,000 on a good title,

225
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,000
and they only have a limited run.

226
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
They really cut their budget that way.

227
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,000
But I think that something like this, given the right marketing behind it,

228
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,000
and I'm sure there would be a lot of praise for it,

229
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
I think it would do pretty well.

230
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:38,000
And when you consider these games like Pets Cats 2 and Purrpals,

231
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
they have no marketing. They have zero marketing.

232
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:46,000
And all you're getting, people are seeing these in the stores,

233
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,000
and they're picking it up based on the cute kitten that's on the front cover.

234
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
That's it.

235
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Because they're, oh, my daughter likes cat games, so they'll pick it up.

236
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:59,000
And if it's a quirky, weird cat game, it's cute, and it's got fun games in it.

237
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
I think it's even better.

238
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Let's go to the chat room, our always present other guests here on the program,

239
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
chat.orangetonshooter.com.

240
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Dark Tetsuya in chat asks,

241
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
yeah, who would we contact about localizing this, if anyone?

242
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
And this kind of, you know, leading into the next question,

243
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,000
what happens from here with our little mission to get this game localized?

244
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
I have a thought, but go ahead.

245
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:23,000
I would contact kind of the usual bunch of people that are out there

246
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
localizing weird-ass games.

247
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,000
I mean, there's a few companies out there that will do that.

248
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,000
One example would be UFO Interactive.

249
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:36,000
They localize a lot of shoot-em-up games, like shmup games,

250
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,000
bullet hell stuff, and a lot of other weird stuff,

251
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
plus they have their own games that they actually put out as well,

252
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,000
but they do a lot of localization in that sense,

253
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,000
and it's a lot of stuff that I know that their stuff is not selling that many units,

254
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
but I guess they're picking these properties cheap enough

255
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
or something that they decide, you know, that it's worth putting it out.

256
00:11:54,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Like they put out, I forget if it was like Go Minion or something like that.

257
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,000
It ended up coming out as Domino Rally over here or something like that.

258
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
It's like Go Go Minion I think was the name of it.

259
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:09,000
You know, that's a really obscure title, but they went ahead and brought it over here.

260
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Axis Game Localization does the same stuff.

261
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
They've been doing a little bit more mainstream stuff lately.

262
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,000
They've been doing the Guilty Gear series, a lot of stuff from that.

263
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
But there's a few other things that they bring over.

264
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Then if you want to talk to other publishers,

265
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:26,000
there's Zoo Games that brings out a lot of like, you know, kind of bargain bin stuff.

266
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,000
They do a lot of localization for UK games that get released over there,

267
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,000
but they're willing to bring over properties that no one has any idea what the hell they are over here,

268
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:40,000
like Kokoto, which is some sort of demon character that's popular I guess in the UK or something.

269
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,000
So should our listeners that feel passionate about the game email these guys, tweet them?

270
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:48,000
No, I think it'd be a good idea to maybe bring it up to maybe,

271
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:54,000
I would go with like UFO Interactive and maybe Triaxis, maybe even like D3 or something,

272
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:59,000
because remember D3, they brought over Defense Force, which is sweet and weird.

273
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Only Shambara, plus they have a simple series in Japan, so they're used to weird ass games,

274
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:12,000
but it's just, I don't know, it couldn't hurt to hit up more people than less.

275
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:17,000
In a way, I think our quirky little mission has succeeded big already.

276
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:21,000
I mean obviously this was just kind of like a running joke last week,

277
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:25,000
and I don't want to say it's a joke, because I mean there's a lot of truth to it.

278
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Obviously it's something that kind of got like way bigger than we ever thought.

279
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:32,000
I mean with them responding and what have you, but in a way I think it already succeeded.

280
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Having hit all the game blogs, having, I mean, let's face it, the developers' Twitter,

281
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:42,000
their numbers of followers has doubled, damn near tripled since everything happened last week.

282
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,000
You know, and I think in that regard, I think it already got the point across in regards to,

283
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,000
hey, there's an audience over here for this kind of like quirky stuff.

284
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:53,000
If you don't think game developers have already noticed when, you know,

285
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,000
several major, major gaming blogs picked up the story.

286
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Yeah, and really what it came down to is what are these, what kind of units are they looking to sell?

287
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
What would make it worthwhile for them to bring it over here?

288
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
I mean obviously something like this is not going to sell a million units.

289
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,000
I mean it's not going to be, I don't think it's going to be the next Katamari.

290
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
I mean it's not.

291
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,000
They didn't think the Katamari was going to be the next Katamari.

292
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Actually it's good you bring that up, but keep in mind Katamari Damacy was a big risk too.

293
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,000
That game was released for 20 bucks several years ago.

294
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:23,000
And it was weird, and everyone loved it because it was different.

295
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:27,000
I want to read this comment, and I don't know if you have anything else you want to say on this Dark Sakura,

296
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
but another comment from chat, Bochikawa in chat,

297
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Skye, the best jokes are those that we all can relate to,

298
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,000
and I think you hit the nail on the head there.

299
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Again, this is not the first game we've screamed from the mountain tops,

300
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
has ought to be localized and brought over here.

301
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Keep in mind, this show started as a music game based show,

302
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:50,000
and we have screamed at the top of our lungs about tons and tons of music games

303
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
since the very beginning of this.

304
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:56,000
But for some reason, this one got people's attention.

305
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,000
And it's part the Twitter thing.

306
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
I think that speaks for me about Twitter.

307
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
It's part the Twitter thing.

308
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
But I think it's part the fact that people looked at this and went,

309
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
oh my God, this does look really cute.

310
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Why isn't there like a lolcats game with this as big as, you know,

311
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
maybe that wasn't the point behind this game,

312
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
but that's what a lot of us are kind of interpreting it as,

313
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
is cats in funny situations, cat wearing cat masks,

314
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:21,000
and the whole like stealing money game I saw a video of with the cats,

315
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
and the cat driving the car.

316
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:30,000
It is ridiculous and preposterous like lolcats and fun, fun, fun.

317
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:34,000
I think that the best kind of fun is the ones you don't expect to be fun.

318
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
You know, the ones that surprise you.

319
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,000
I played the cat dodging game about ten times.

320
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
It's fun.

321
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
It's just ridiculous and weird.

322
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
And it's fun because there's like, you know,

323
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
you have to dodge a cat and then there's cats that will jump out

324
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
with like hearts above their heads.

325
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:50,000
You have to expand your arms out to catch the cat in a loving embrace.

326
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:55,000
And it does it in this really weird like slow motion cut scene with,

327
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
you know, like roses and all sorts of stuff.

328
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
It's weird, but it's funny.

329
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:03,000
I got to read this comment from actdeft in our chat room,

330
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
and who says that Twitter is useless?

331
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
I did two weeks ago.

332
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,000
I was actually listening to the show before last week's show,

333
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,000
and I had said I was done and fed up with Twitter,

334
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
and I didn't get the point.

335
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Boy, did I get told.

336
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Well, didn't I tell you, you know,

337
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,000
that I've done some of my best networking through Twitter.

338
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:25,000
And, you know, I've gotten a little bit of work through Twitter.

339
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,000
You know, it really is super useful.

340
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:32,000
And especially, you know, right now it greatly served our purpose.

341
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
You know.

342
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
What is our purpose?

343
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Whatever we determine it is at the time.

344
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:42,000
No, I think our purpose was to show that more Japanese developers

345
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
should think about bringing their quirky little games over here,

346
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
because there's an audience for it.

347
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
I mean, shoot.

348
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Where was it that we would always go to at E3?

349
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
We would go to the small little developers,

350
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
to the ones that were looking.

351
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Kensha Frickin' Hall.

352
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Or the back corner where Natsume had their little walk around

353
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
thinking you could get, like,

354
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,000
my sheep is right over there, my Harvest Moon sheep.

355
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
You know.

356
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,000
And also I was thinking, you know,

357
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Matt made some good suggestions,

358
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
but I think also look for that company,

359
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:17,000
see if they've released any other games that have been released in the US

360
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,000
and see who their marketer was.

361
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,000
But certainly, though, after the antics of last week,

362
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:27,000
you know in a boardroom somewhere in Japan this got brought up.

363
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
We're going to this crazy guy, Gene.

364
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
It's just very interesting.

365
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
I've got one more question for Loki,

366
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
and then we're going to get into how was your gaming week

367
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
and the way we usually start off the show.

368
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Loki, what I'm really curious about, what did the wife think?

369
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
She thought it was weird.

370
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
I don't know.

371
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,000
She didn't really pay attention because I stopped playing it

372
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,000
because she got tired because I can't read any of the text,

373
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
and there's a lot of dialogue in the game.

374
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
And every time you progress the text forward,

375
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
it makes a bing sound.

376
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
So I was clicking, and it's all bing, bing, bing, bing, bing, bing.

377
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,000
She's like, stop that. That's annoying.

378
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
So that was pretty much...

379
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:07,000
For you to be developers when you localize this, a little less bing.

380
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
How about a cute meow noise instead of a bing?

381
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Something I actually noticed from the screenshots

382
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,000
is that it's actually in very simple Japanese.

383
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
But part of the reason I was wondering

384
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,000
is how much of it was actually spoken dialogue

385
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
is because it would be much easier to follow if it's spoken.

386
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
There wasn't really any spoken.

387
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,000
There was a lot of meows and lots of text boxes.

388
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,000
What's also interesting, I've been looking on Twitter,

389
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
and quite a few people on Twitter have been talking about

390
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
how they got the game from Play Asia and so on.

391
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:36,000
So oddly enough, our little crusade ended up increasing the sales in Japan,

392
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
even if by a little bit.

393
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,000
So you're welcome for the free advertising.

394
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,000
I want someone to get the game for me.

395
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
All right.

396
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
I will render services.

397
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Any other thoughts on President Cat for now?

398
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
I don't know if there's anything left to say.

399
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
In a way, I kind of think our mission was successful.

400
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,000
I don't know if there's a lot else that can be done.

401
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Ultimately, it's out of our hands at this point,

402
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
and it is who's going to take a risk.

403
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
We can keep the awareness up.

404
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
I think we can keep the awareness up,

405
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
and we can alert the potential risk takers.

406
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Keep that hashtag going.

407
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Yeah, keep the hashtag going.

408
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Tweet the companies that you think ought to bring it over,

409
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,000
and who knows what may happen.

410
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Especially those of you that felt the need to email,

411
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
because I know this could act deft.

412
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
They'd thank at the bottom of the Joystick article,

413
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
so I know this came from tips from listeners,

414
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
these various game blogs around the story.

415
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Now that we've got that, I guess,

416
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,000
start emailing some of the developers and see what happens.

417
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
I mean, the worst that happens, they're going to delete it.

418
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Actually, I got their email address, the people over there.

419
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,000
I've just been trying to get a hold of one of my friends in Japan

420
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,000
to translate it for me, and she's been less than forthcoming

421
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,000
because she has a mutual friend is over there visiting,

422
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:48,000
so I might see if any of our Japanese listeners

423
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:52,000
who's really good with your translation let me know,

424
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:57,000
because I wanted to let them know exactly how we came across them.

425
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:02,000
So shoot an email at the mailbag, and we'll work together.

426
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:07,000
There may be some lucrative opportunity for you.

427
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,000
All right. Well, let's get back into our regular show here.

428
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Obviously, we've taken a 20-minute detour to talk about President Cap,

429
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:17,000
but that kind of thing happens when we tend to get spotlighted for a week

430
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
for whatever reason.

431
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
We're going to move into our regular show now.

432
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Our ego's full, and we turn into Big Divas.

433
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Basically. Hey, wait a minute. What is this?

434
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:29,000
I asked for a Diet Coke. What is this? Anyway.

435
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:34,000
I'm sorry. I wanted 2% milk in my latte. Hi.

436
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
I peed in your latte.

437
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
You're a butt.

438
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
We're going to get into how was your gaming week.

439
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
We always like to start off the show with a little bit of that,

440
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,000
but let me quick just explain if anybody should be listening for the first time

441
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
because you heard about this through the President Cap stuff.

442
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
You know, we're three friends who've been doing this show

443
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
for about seven and a half years.

444
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
We all met in an arcade playing Dance Dance Revolution,

445
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,000
and we used to go to a little café right across the street

446
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,000
called Brookfield's after a night of arcade gaming,

447
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
and we'd just kind of sit around and talk smack about each other,

448
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,000
about video games, about whatever was going on in the world.

449
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
It was just basically nerds sitting around the dinner table,

450
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,000
and that's kind of the theme we like to emulate here,

451
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
and the way we invite you to the dinner table

452
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
is through all the ways to interact with our show,

453
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,000
chat.orangelandtrader.com, our Skype line, our mailbag, and so forth.

454
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Twitter now, too.

455
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
I don't know you guys. Get out of my house.

456
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Shut up. All right.

457
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,000
One way we like to always start off the show, though,

458
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
is with what we've been playing this week.

459
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Dark Sakura, how have you had your gaming week?

460
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
How was your gaming week?

461
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
PEGGLE!

462
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Lots and lots of PEGGLE.

463
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:34,000
My goal in PEGGLE has been to beat some of the levels on the first try,

464
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,000
and I beat that freaking hard DNA level on the first try,

465
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
and I was very proud of myself.

466
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Like, one of the last ones with the spirals going up.

467
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:47,000
Anyway, I have also really not been playing much of anything else

468
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,000
just simply because I had my midterms last week

469
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:57,000
and migraines all last week and just the son of crap all week.

470
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:00,000
So I haven't really had too much of an opportunity,

471
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:05,000
although I'm still campaigning for, you know,

472
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,000
potential World of Warcrafting, maybe.

473
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
I just don't have time.

474
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
All right.

475
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Loki, how was your gaming week?

476
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
It was pretty good.

477
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,000
I actually played, well, like I mentioned earlier,

478
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:22,000
President Cat, so I played a little bit of the new Renegame,

479
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
and it was fun.

480
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
I got through.

481
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
It starts off, it kind of breaks it up,

482
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
like there's three minigames that you have to do

483
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
and then like three more after that,

484
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
and I got past the first three minigames,

485
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:38,000
which is tough because the last one was like some question-answer thing.

486
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,000
I can't read any of that, so I just kept hitting random buttons,

487
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
and yet somehow I was getting it correct.

488
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
So I managed to get past that.

489
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
I played the piano portion,

490
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
even though I was hitting it in time.

491
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
I guess I wasn't doing it well enough,

492
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
and so they're getting pissed off.

493
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:56,000
And of course the car driving,

494
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:00,000
which is weird because you're like controlling the cat in the back of the car

495
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:05,000
that's sucking up what I look like stars or clouds or something.

496
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:08,000
It's just weird.

497
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:13,000
And then also play the cat dodging, which was kind of fun.

498
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:16,000
But yeah, the game is weird and fun.

499
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
So definitely worth checking out.

500
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,000
The other thing of course I played tons of was DJ Hero.

501
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:25,000
We just knocked out most of the songs in the game.

502
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:28,000
I think I've actually played through everything now.

503
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Maybe a few tracks I'm missing,

504
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,000
but I've almost five-starred everything on Medium,

505
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:36,000
and I've started trying out some of the songs on Hard,

506
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:41,000
and it gets a lot harder, that's for sure.

507
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:44,000
But very fun game.

508
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:48,000
I hope everyone checks it out when it comes out in two days.

509
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,000
And then finally of course Grand Theft Auto IV

510
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
played some more Lost and Damned.

511
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:57,000
Also found a way around their patch to get rid of the mods,

512
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:01,000
but I haven't really done much with that because it's not working correct.

513
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:05,000
Because apparently if you've ever modded the Grand Theft Auto on PC,

514
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:10,000
if you change too much, it becomes unstable.

515
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:15,000
And then each save file actually saves some of the stuff that you change.

516
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
So if I try to change certain weapons or whatever,

517
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:21,000
they'll kind of disappear from the save, and it's a pain in the ass.

518
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:24,000
So I found a way around all that,

519
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,000
but unfortunately the modded discs I made was very unstable,

520
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
so I have to go back to the drawing board.

521
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:32,000
I don't really care though because the new expansion's coming out at the end of next week,

522
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
so I may just hold off on modding everything

523
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:39,000
until I can maybe get my hands on the episodes of Liberty City disc instead.

524
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:42,000
Because that might be a little more fun.

525
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
We were even just playing the new expansion,

526
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:47,000
because that's just going to be all sorts of awesome.

527
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:52,000
And other than that, I moved the arcade cabinet into the house this afternoon,

528
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:55,000
so I'm hopefully going to be done with that soon.

529
00:24:55,000 --> 00:25:01,000
I'm downloading some front-end stuff for this program called Hyper Spin.

530
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
I'm going to be running on it.

531
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:08,000
So I've been downloading themes for a bunch of different games that I have in MAME.

532
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:12,000
And that's it.

533
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,000
I've been playing mostly World of Warcraft this week,

534
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
because I'm sucked into wowcrack.

535
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:20,000
But I did try out one new game.

536
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,000
I say game in quotes because it wasn't really a game,

537
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:28,000
but I checked out a game on PlayStation Network this week called Dot Detuned,

538
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,000
or just Detuned I guess you could call the game.

539
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:34,000
And it was something I think that was brought up at the very end of our show last week.

540
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
I want to say one of the callers alerted us to it.

541
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,000
I don't know if I saw it on Twitter during the week, but I saw it was $3.

542
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
And I was like, wow, what a deal for a game.

543
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
So I went ahead and downloaded it and checked it out.

544
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:46,000
And yeah, it wasn't quite what I was expecting,

545
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:50,000
because I heard that you could use custom soundtracks in the game,

546
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:55,000
and I finally figured out why my songs weren't copying over on my USB card to the PS3.

547
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:58,000
I had to go in there and do all or whatever, hit the triangle button.

548
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,000
I was finally able to figure it out.

549
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:02,000
So I got a bunch of custom songs on my PlayStation 3, so I was excited.

550
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:07,000
And I was like, oh, a game that uses custom soundtracks and it says it builds the game around the soundtracks.

551
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:10,000
I'm like, oh, cool, it's like a music game, like a beat matching game.

552
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:14,000
I love music games, that's what I'm all about, so let's check out this game.

553
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:17,000
Not exactly.

554
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:21,000
This is one of those games that's kind of like, I guess you could call it video game art.

555
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:25,000
And I know that's weird, because there's that whole controversy out there in the world,

556
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
are video games art?

557
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:31,000
But this is definitely one of those things where you kind of look at it and go,

558
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
well, it's not really a game either.

559
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
And PlayStation has a few of these.

560
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
I mean, PlayStation Network's kind of been the home for these.

561
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:42,000
But in a way, like Flower, that game on PlayStation Network was kind of art, too.

562
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,000
But there was a game there, and that was a really cool game.

563
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:50,000
Actually, I think Flower is one of the best, if not the best PlayStation Network title out there.

564
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
It's a beautiful game.

565
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:56,000
It's the strangest racing game you'll ever play in your life, but it's amazing.

566
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:59,000
So I thought, okay, I'll take a chance on this Detune game.

567
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
But it's really weird.

568
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:04,000
Like, you use buttons to pump the guy sitting in the chair.

569
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:08,000
And depending on what kind of skin you've selected with your direction buttons

570
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:12,000
and your triangle, square, X buttons might make it do different things.

571
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,000
Like, he might turn into an elephant man.

572
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:18,000
Or he might turn into a ghost-looking man.

573
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,000
And then as you wind the R-stick, he might dance around the chair

574
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
or do this weird thing in the chair.

575
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
And then if you hit another button, it deflates.

576
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:28,000
Basically, it's like playing with a baby toy.

577
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,000
You hit all these different buttons and it makes different noises

578
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,000
or has all these different effects.

579
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,000
It's very strange.

580
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
But I can't stress this enough.

581
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
There is no game here.

582
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
There is no object. There is nothing to do.

583
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
And yes, you can use your custom soundtracks.

584
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:45,000
And some of the pumps and little effects will distort the soundtrack.

585
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:49,000
This is literally one of those things that you sit there and you press the buttons

586
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
and it kind of does different things.

587
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:54,000
I imagine it's a lot more impactful if you're on drugs or something.

588
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:57,000
I'm not on drugs, so I didn't quite see that.

589
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:01,000
But yeah, it was just interesting.

590
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:04,000
I'm not saying it was bad because it was three dollars.

591
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
And it's certainly something different.

592
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
I'm just saying it's not a game.

593
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
So be careful.

594
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:13,000
And yet it awards trophies even though it's not a game.

595
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,000
And I will tell you this.

596
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:17,000
If you want the easiest trophies,

597
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:21,000
like easier than those achievements in the Avatar game on 360,

598
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
just pay the three bucks for this game.

599
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:26,000
And you can have a gold trophy, like three silvers and a handful of bronze.

600
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
A handful of bronze in seconds.

601
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:31,000
I didn't even look at what the trophies were.

602
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:35,000
And I had all but one of them unlocked in five minutes in the game.

603
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
It was incredibly simple.

604
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:41,000
But that's, of course, I wouldn't recommend downloading a game just for trophies.

605
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
But I know there's some people out there that are, you know,

606
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
E-peen whores and want to see that stuff.

607
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:49,000
Otherwise, this is kind of one of those things.

608
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
I don't know if you ever go to the Museum of Modern Art

609
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
and you see some things in there that are really, really cool.

610
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
Like Andy Warhol paintings.

611
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,000
Well, that's kind of neat.

612
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
You know, that Marilyn Monroe painting is kind of rad.

613
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:01,000
But then, like, you see that other piece on the wall that just looks like

614
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:05,000
someone threw a paint can against the canvas and called it art.

615
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,000
That's art!

616
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:09,000
Well, this is, okay, well, this is what that game,

617
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:12,000
this is the art equivalent of that.

618
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,000
This is the video game equivalent of that art piece.

619
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:20,000
You kind of look at it and go, okay, I guess there's art in here somewhere.

620
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:25,000
So, but you know what, it does add to the very interesting debate

621
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:28,000
that is, are video games art or not?

622
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
It's very, very strange.

623
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
So there you go.

624
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
And I'm going to link this in the chat room.

625
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
But look at this. Isn't that art?

626
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
I've seen that before.

627
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:42,000
But it's not what one would conventionally think of,

628
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
like a Renoir or anything.

629
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,000
I'll link it in the chat room.

630
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
Terrible radio trying to describe a painting.

631
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,000
There's lines and boxes.

632
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:51,000
All I need to tell anyone is that it's one of Mondrian's work.

633
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:55,000
You know, it's the primary colors, black and white on a grid,

634
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:59,000
but that's still art, even though it's not really representational of anything.

635
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:02,000
So, I mean, it all depends on what you enjoy.

636
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
And there's some people that are going to look at that and go,

637
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
what the fuck is that crap?

638
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
You know, somebody paid thousands of dollars for that?

639
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:11,000
So, and that would exactly be this game.

640
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
There's going to be some people that look at it and go, wow, this is art.

641
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,000
This is cool.

642
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:20,000
This is just like an interactive experience that you can only get on a video game console.

643
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:23,000
And there's some people that are going to look at it and go, what the fucking shit?

644
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,000
Are these people on drugs?

645
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:27,000
And keep in mind, there was the all audio game on Saturn where you get seeds.

646
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,000
Uh-huh.

647
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:33,000
And it's zero visual. It's all audio, the way you play the game.

648
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,000
Interesting.

649
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
And you grow seeds into plants.

650
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,000
Is that like Seaman?

651
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
No, seeds. Like, real.

652
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:43,000
It comes with a packet of seeds and you plant them.

653
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,000
All right.

654
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:47,000
Yeah. So, that's not the most bizarre thing ever.

655
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:50,000
Uh, going to the chat room, alpha-kinanagram is in caps.

656
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:53,000
It's not a game, da-da-da. I believe I said that.

657
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,000
It's not a game.

658
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:58,000
But keep in mind, they're selling it in the game section of the PlayStation Store.

659
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
So, just, you know, be forewarned.

660
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,000
It is not a game.

661
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:05,000
And it awards trophies like a game would do.

662
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:08,000
You know, games usually have objectives and there are objectives with the trophy.

663
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
But it's not a game. I'm just saying.

664
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
It's not a game.

665
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
I'm not saying it's bad.

666
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
It's just weird.

667
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,000
Different.

668
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
Art is interpretation.

669
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
I interpreted this as, huh?

670
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000
Some people are going to interpret this as cool.

671
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:26,000
Some people are going to interpret this as, pfft.

672
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
Just, interpretation.

673
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,000
As caca.

674
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,000
Yes, exactly.

675
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:33,000
So, that pretty much does it for my gaming week.

676
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
We're going to get into some gaming news here shortly.

677
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,000
But first, some housekeeping.

678
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:41,000
Hey, if you're not already, follow us on Twitter at www.Twitter.com slash O-L-R.

679
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
And also on tonight's show.

680
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
We actually have a pretty full show tonight.

681
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:49,000
We're going to be interviewing later on in the show, in part B, our pal Seg.

682
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:54,000
He is putting on a big part of this OOM LOUD event that's going on in San Francisco.

683
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
It's a charity event for Child's Play.

684
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:02,000
And we think these kinds of things that are very creative and involve video games and, you know, raise money for good causes.

685
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:10,000
Things that give gamers a good name as opposed to, you know, kid shoots up neighbors, says he was inspired by Grand Theft Auto.

686
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:15,000
We love covering things like this that really offset the crap stuff that's in the media.

687
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,000
So, this is a great cause.

688
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
We hope our friends in the Bay Area will show up to this.

689
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
We're going to talk to Seg a little later in the show.

690
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,000
Talk about OOM LOUD.

691
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,000
I know I'm going.

692
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
I think Jamie's going to go because I'll give her a ride.

693
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,000
She said all she needed was a ride.

694
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
Loki will try to get to go.

695
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:30,000
If all of us can go, we could have a band.

696
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
Might be fun.

697
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:35,000
Loki, you might have to see if you can get away from the wife for a night.

698
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,000
I don't know.

699
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,000
We could call the band President Cat.

700
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,000
Come on.

701
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,000
You know you want to do it.

702
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
All right.

703
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:44,000
Anyhow, we'll get into that a little later on in Part B of our show.

704
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
But first, some gaming news.

705
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,000
Start us off tonight, Loki.

706
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,000
Yes.

707
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:52,000
Recently, Microsoft opened their first Microsoft store in Scottsdale, Arizona.

708
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:58,000
And, of course, one of the big things about the store, other than kind of being sort of a copy of an Apple store,

709
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:06,000
is that they have the ability to basically print their own Windows games.

710
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:16,000
And the way this is done is you actually order it from a kiosk and then give your name, I guess, to one of the representatives in the stores.

711
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:21,000
And then basically you wait a few minutes and you'll actually have the game with the label on the game printed,

712
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:28,000
the case and inserts as well as the manual all printed for you.

713
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:40,000
So it's kind of like that whole, I don't know, they have a kiosk out there that will print, or I guess it will make custom DVDs for you as well, like movies.

714
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:51,000
But this is kind of cool, actually, because you can't really knock it since games, like for PC at least, there's not really a used market for them.

715
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:54,000
At least not one that you would see in a GameStop or something like that.

716
00:33:54,000 --> 00:34:04,000
So if you're looking for a case and stuff and they don't have to have inventory in the store, I mean, that's pretty awesome.

717
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:11,000
I'd be kind of curious to see if they could do something like this with Xbox Live arcade games or something. That'd be pretty cool.

718
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:16,000
Kind of different. I mean, haven't they talked about this, though, for like video rentals, though?

719
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:23,000
And I don't know how successful this was, but I think a while ago Blockbuster was talking about how video stores would sometimes run out of movies.

720
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:27,000
That they could actually print out movies that you want to rent right there on the spot.

721
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:31,000
Originally I thought that's what those Red Boss kiosks did, but I guess that's not really what they do.

722
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:42,000
Now they had something that they were going to work on where you would be able to basically, it would burn DVDs for you, and you would have to get the licensing through different companies for this.

723
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:53,000
And the people that were kind of participating in it were actually really small studios that didn't really have the money or whatever to sell stock and that kind of stuff.

724
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:57,000
Or even catalog items for some of the major studios and whatnot.

725
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:04,000
It was supposed to cut down their costs because they don't store all this catalog product that doesn't sell as fast.

726
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:20,000
I guess I get the idea of putting out of print or catalog games into this kind of system, but as far as new games go, isn't the whole reason to walk into a store and buy a video game as opposed to just going onto Steam or Direct-to-Drive or one of those companies online?

727
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:27,000
Isn't the whole point of having the box, having the manual and that kind of new game smell that comes when you open up the box?

728
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:34,000
They still get that. I mean, they get the manual and everything printed. It's just, you know, they won't get the big giant cardboard box that goes with it.

729
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
Which I guess saves trees, I don't know.

730
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:42,000
And, you know, I guess you could look at it that way, but it's neat, I guess.

731
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:50,000
You'll be able to get a disc and you won't have to worry about it being out of stock because they're just burning a game for you, so why not?

732
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:59,000
Of course, I kind of look at this and go, well, you know, it would be cool, I guess, if the kiosk or whatever is kind of like showing you a demo of the game so you can play the game and then order it on the spot.

733
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:05,000
But then again, you could kind of do the same thing with a lot of these online systems like Steam and so forth.

734
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:08,000
You play a demo of the game and if you like it, drop the money for the full version.

735
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:14,000
But I guess this might be cool for like parents going Christmas shopping, wanting to buy computer games for the kids.

736
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:20,000
You know, you could see what the game looks like on a monitor in front of you, kind of see if it's appropriate for kids or not.

737
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:26,000
Like if it's, you know, Lego that you're getting or if it's, you know, Demon Slayers from Hell with boobies or whatever.

738
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:33,000
You know, you don't want to get the kids, you can kind of see what it is in the kiosk before you actually buy it and then have it printed right there.

739
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:36,000
I guess that would be the target audience for this kind of thing?

740
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,000
I think so, yeah.

741
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,000
Question mark?

742
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,000
Yeah.

743
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:44,000
And some comments from our chatroom at chat.orangelaunchradio.com.

744
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:48,000
GameGuru says, besides, you can buy DVD cases and print out box art.

745
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
Yeah, but I don't know, it's not the same.

746
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:53,000
Like the homemade stuff just isn't the same to me.

747
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:58,000
It's not the same and they actually, you know, obviously since it's games for Windows stuff, they have this stuff licensed.

748
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:02,000
They have the actual manufacturers giving them the artwork for this.

749
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:14,000
They have probably the process to, I'm sure it's not just going to be like an inkjet printer printing out a piece of crappy, you know, artwork that's going to be on paper that looks like cheap, you know, crap that you would make at home.

750
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:17,000
But I think this is going to be a little bit better than that.

751
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:27,000
And I don't know, I mean, I'd be interested to see, there's a lot of people that reported on this and, you know, obviously a lot of people that visited the store.

752
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:35,000
So, how is the software that's, you know, burned off that? I mean, does it look good? Does it, you know, look cheap and knocked off?

753
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:39,000
I mean, is it something that you could probably do at home for a lot less or?

754
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:44,000
Haven't you ever bought a video game and then you came home and like you were just kind of opening and going through it?

755
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:50,000
And unfortunately a lot of console games, especially Nintendo ones, put a lot of crap in there like sign up for the club, sign up for the whatever.

756
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:57,000
But haven't you ever like, there's been some games where you pull out the manual and you're like, this is an epic manual.

757
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,000
And I'm kind of glad I bought the game.

758
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
Anything Working Designs did?

759
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:06,000
Yeah. I thought Demon's Souls, just speaking of a very recent game, had a pretty epic manual with it.

760
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
I'm sure there's a lot of games out there.

761
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:12,000
And it's just not the same thing as, you know, running it on the inkjet or looking at a PDF file.

762
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:17,000
I would like to see them at their store and I would like to see this in actually other stores.

763
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:25,000
I mean, and yeah, I know you can buy Microsoft points and stuff like that and go purchase your own Xbox Live Arcade games.

764
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:30,000
But I want actual cards for like each individual game, you know, or something that I could print up and say,

765
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:36,000
OK, I want to give the gift of like, and why I would never punish someone like this.

766
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:42,000
Give someone the gift of, say, the Warriors game that they put on Xbox Live Arcade, you know,

767
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:48,000
and have it actually print up with like, you know, a nice little logo and stuff like that and have the code redeem that game.

768
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
And only that game.

769
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
I think that would be kind of cool.

770
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:58,000
But, you know, obviously I know they're out to sell the points cards and stuff because in that way you buy a game

771
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:04,000
and you still have extra points left over and they get you to spend, you know, $20 and $50 instead of, say, $10 or $15.

772
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:12,000
So, OK, Jamie brought in an epic manual that came to her mind and it's for Sega Ages on the Sega Saturn and it's fancy.

773
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:16,000
It's got like raised print and like the foil writing for Sega Ages.

774
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
It was a working designs game.

775
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
It's pretty epic.

776
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,000
There you go.

777
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:28,000
So, I know, could we make cards for Yaris and get those printed and I can give those to like, it's like giving someone a fruitcake for Christmas?

778
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,000
Yeah, it's free.

779
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,000
That would be kind of funny.

780
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:36,000
But even like, you know, not necessarily that, but like custom 1600 point cards or something.

781
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
I guess you could do that if you had the time.

782
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:48,000
You know, just buy a bunch of them and pull them all off and transpose the, you know, the number over to whatever new card you make.

783
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,000
I don't know.

784
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:56,000
It's just a neat idea and, you know, it's a neat way to go, especially now since a lot of businesses are trying to go all digital.

785
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:00,000
So, I don't know. It's kind of cool.

786
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:04,000
Well, this is a game whose manual I'd be curious to see what it looks like.

787
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
It's a game called Choaniki.

788
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:10,000
It's the sequel, I guess, or the prequel Choaniki Zero.

789
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
There have been a ton of Choaniki games.

790
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,000
Yes, but there's a new one coming out.

791
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:17,000
It's coming out to the PSP in spring of 2010.

792
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:21,000
It is coming out also as a download title because that's where all the PSP titles are going now.

793
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:26,000
And, by the way, this is coming out here in the U.S.

794
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
This is being localized.

795
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:31,000
By whom is it being localized?

796
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:34,000
Some brave, brave soul.

797
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:38,000
To be honest, I think Ax-AK-Sis is the name of the company.

798
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
Ax-Sis Game Localization.

799
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:43,000
The company I was talking about that localizes obscure shit.

800
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,000
Hello, this would be a perfect candidate.

801
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:49,000
This would be a perfect candidate because, honestly, like seriously.

802
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,000
It was so funny to see, you know, going back.

803
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:54,000
I'm picking on Joystiq a little bit when they were kind enough to run our article first.

804
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,000
But I have to say this.

805
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:59,000
It was so funny to see that whole little like Debbie Downer paragraph at the end about,

806
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:02,000
well, it would be a shame to see them localize this and lose money on it.

807
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:05,000
And then like not even a day later, here's a story.

808
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:09,000
Choaniki Zero being localized for the U.S. as if there's an audience for this.

809
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:14,000
Because a lot of people look at this and go L-O-L-W-T-F because, yes, if you don't already know,

810
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:23,000
it's all about like muscle bound guys wearing thong and all this muscle man-tastic voyage, I believe,

811
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,000
that press relief Steven said about it.

812
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:28,000
I mean this is a ludicrous freaking game.

813
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:33,000
Yet it's getting localized and it's coming out of here.

814
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:36,000
And the SNES one came out in Virtual Console.

815
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
And don't get me wrong.

816
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:42,000
I'm all for this kind of like weird shit coming out and I might even like check it out.

817
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
Especially if there's a demo for me to play.

818
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
You know, it's something different.

819
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:49,000
It certainly stands out from the countless other shooters I've seen.

820
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:52,000
But it is a little weird.

821
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
But there's an audience for this.

822
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:58,000
So I just can't, it's funny to me that there's an audience for this.

823
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:03,000
Yet President Cat, you know, doesn't apparently have an audience over here.

824
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,000
And it's going to end up in bargain bins across America.

825
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:08,000
So it's just interesting.

826
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:14,000
So yeah, as Loki said, there's your perfect candidate company for someone to bring the kitty cat games over with.

827
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,000
We'll see.

828
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:20,000
Well, how about something that is no surprise to anybody?

829
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
What's that?

830
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:28,000
Microsoft has poo-pooed on any thoughts of having Blu-ray on Xbox 360.

831
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:31,000
Which we sort of knew.

832
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:37,000
But they were talking about, Microsoft was actually talking about Blu-ray accessories for the PC.

833
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,000
But not for the Xbox 360.

834
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:43,000
Yeah, I think some interview that some dude did with some website earlier this week.

835
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:46,000
Isn't that so professional? Some dude at some website.

836
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:50,000
It's pretty much the boss, Steve Ballmer, said uh-uh.

837
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:56,000
But a lot of people interpreted him to say that these Blu-ray, oh Blu-ray for Xbox 360, imminent.

838
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
I saw that all over Twitter that night.

839
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
Blu-rays coming to Xbox 360.

840
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:03,000
That was me rolling my eyes and going, no.

841
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:04,000
Yeah.

842
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:07,000
Why would Microsoft put out a Sony product especially?

843
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,000
And you know they kind of make a good point.

844
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:14,000
And it's funny enough because yet again, here's something we just talked about two weeks ago on the show or even last week.

845
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:22,000
I think before all that cat madness started, we were talking about how, you know, one thing that Sony has that Microsoft doesn't have is Blu-ray.

846
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:27,000
And if Microsoft was smart, they would be selling the streaming video, the Netflix.

847
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:32,000
And sure enough, when they kind of backpedaled on what the dude had said earlier in the week.

848
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:39,000
They said, hey, we're going to be the only system with streaming 1080p very soon.

849
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:43,000
So they're kind of saying, you don't need Blu-ray when you have streaming video.

850
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,000
Yeah.

851
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:46,000
I don't know.

852
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:49,000
I like the Netflix Instant Q stuff.

853
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:55,000
I like Netflix Instant Q, but at the same time, I'm very proud this week of one of my purchases.

854
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:59,000
I bought the box collection of the Star Trek Next Generation movies.

855
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:02,000
That's right, all four movies with Captain Picard and a bonus disc.

856
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:03,000
I'm very excited.

857
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:04,000
On Blu-ray.

858
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
And that's not something I would have wanted to download.

859
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:07,000
So you're bringing that over, right?

860
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:08,000
We could totally have a Nerdathon.

861
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:09,000
I am all over.

862
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,000
I actually haven't seen Insurrection.

863
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,000
What?

864
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:14,000
And I've got it on Laserdisc, I think.

865
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:17,000
Oh my gosh, we should totally have a Blu-ray Next Genathon.

866
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:20,000
No, I have first contact on Laserdisc.

867
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:21,000
Can we drink?

868
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:22,000
Sure.

869
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:23,000
Awesome.

870
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:24,000
We're going to have a nerdy slumber party.

871
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:25,000
I like Booz Mahal.

872
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:26,000
It'll be awesome.

873
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
Anyhow, I don't know how we got off topic.

874
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:32,000
But for me, it's kind of the same thing going back to the story we were talking about earlier

875
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
with the games being printed on demand.

876
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:37,000
I would not have downloaded the Star Trek collection.

877
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:41,000
And even though I could probably get a lot of these on Instant Netflix,

878
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:48,000
it's just not the same as having the collection in your house anytime you want, put in the disc.

879
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:52,000
Yeah, but it's easier for me to watch stuff on my computer.

880
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:55,000
Is it just me or Blu-rays seeming to get a little cheaper?

881
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,000
They're getting a little cheaper, not much.

882
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,000
You're finding used ones more often.

883
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,000
And I'm finding a lot of sales now.

884
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,000
I'm seeing a lot of Blu-rays.

885
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:04,000
I was at Best Buy this week.

886
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,000
One game I didn't talk about during my gaming week,

887
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
because we've talked about it at length the past couple weeks,

888
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
I finally played the DJ Hero demo.

889
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,000
Loki's had DJ Hero here the past couple weeks,

890
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:15,000
but he's always been the one playing it because he knows what he's doing.

891
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,000
I finally got my hands on it this week, and that was fun.

892
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,000
I was at Best Buy, and I was looking at Blu-rays.

893
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,000
They had a lot of Blu-rays available for $10, $15.

894
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:25,000
So they're starting to come the way of DVDs.

895
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:26,000
They're still a little more expensive than DVDs.

896
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,000
You can get DVDs for $4 at Walmart,

897
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:33,000
but they're coming down a little bit, which is nice.

898
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:34,000
All right.

899
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,000
Let's move on with some more gaming news.

900
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,000
We'll get to release dates very soon

901
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:41,000
and see if there's anything wacky coming out this week.

902
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:42,000
But first, some more news.

903
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:47,000
Yeah, and I don't know about another president, Kat.

904
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:50,000
Yeah, I'm all campaigned out.

905
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:54,000
So Xbox Live, the preview for the new fall update,

906
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:58,000
they have sent out their first Wave 1 invites.

907
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:02,000
In fact, actually, I got one of those, so I have the new update.

908
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:05,000
I haven't gotten a chance to play with a lot of the stuff on there,

909
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,000
but I did do the Twitter thing,

910
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:12,000
and the problem I see is I don't think I'm going to use half this stuff.

911
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:17,000
I mean, the Twitter and the Facebook stuff, it's neat.

912
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:20,000
Do you know how many tweets I saw this week that were,

913
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:24,000
hey, I'm posting from my 360? I'm just like, eye roll.

914
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,000
Like, we totally saw this coming.

915
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
Everybody's going to have to do that mandatory tweet.

916
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:31,000
Hey, guys, I got in the preview program.

917
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:32,000
Here's my tweet from the 360.

918
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:35,000
Hey, I want to tell you guys a secret.

919
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:38,000
Almost everybody who signs up for these preview programs gets in.

920
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:39,000
You know why?

921
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:42,000
Because it's Microsoft's little way now.

922
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,000
Do you remember when their system crashed a couple of years ago

923
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:45,000
when they rolled out one of these updates

924
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,000
because everybody was freaking downloading it at once?

925
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:50,000
This little preview program is their way of doing a rolling release

926
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,000
for these updates.

927
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,000
Except they're going to have to re-download it.

928
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:55,000
It's not the full thing.

929
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:56,000
Oh, really?

930
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:57,000
Yeah.

931
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:58,000
Interesting.

932
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,000
Because the music store isn't working yet.

933
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:03,000
Well, they have Lips on there, and that's it.

934
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:07,000
But yeah, so apparently a lot of people got in on it,

935
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:10,000
and they did have a lot of cool stuff in there.

936
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,000
Of course, if you're in the UK, you got to check out the Skyplayer

937
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,000
and that kind of thing.

938
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:21,000
Over here in North America, they had, of course, the Last.fm,

939
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:22,000
Facebook.

940
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:23,000
Did you check out the Last.fm by chance?

941
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:24,000
No, I haven't.

942
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,000
That's the one thing I am kind of curious about,

943
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:27,000
because I am a Last.fm user.

944
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:30,000
I prefer it to Pandora and the other services available out there.

945
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,000
I think they're great,

946
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,000
because the way it kind of syncs up with your iPod and everything

947
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,000
with the Scrobbler,

948
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:39,000
and the recommendations have been, for the most part, pretty good.

949
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:43,000
So I'm really curious to see what the Last.fm does,

950
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:46,000
if I can play them during my games or what.

951
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:49,000
Maybe somebody in chat who's in the preview program can clue me in.

952
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,000
It would be cool if you can,

953
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:56,000
because I've done a little bit of custom soundtrack stuff.

954
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,000
There's not a lot of games that use it quite right.

955
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,000
Like Grand Theft Auto, for example,

956
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,000
when you just play it, it just plays over everything,

957
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:05,000
and it's kind of annoying, because it doesn't just play

958
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,000
when you get in a car or something like that,

959
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,000
which is disappointing.

960
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,000
I don't know.

961
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:12,000
It's neat.

962
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:15,000
I'll probably get a chance to play with a little bit more of it this week.

963
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:16,000
I just kind of like,

964
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
oh, look, hey, it downloaded, and, you know,

965
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,000
oh, okay, try the tweet.

966
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:21,000
Okay, I'm going to bed.

967
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,000
You know, and that was it.

968
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,000
The chat room is confirming for me,

969
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:27,000
DJ Dark Knight and Golden Anthro both saying

970
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:28,000
you can't play them with your games.

971
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,000
Last.fm does not work with your game.

972
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,000
Okay, that's lame.

973
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,000
Well, I guess it's the kind of thing that might be

974
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,000
background noise at parties or something,

975
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,000
or, you know, I could just turn on the Xbox in my living room,

976
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,000
because I don't have a computer in my living room,

977
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,000
and let's say maybe I'm cleaning or something

978
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,000
and I want to listen to synth pop while I do it,

979
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,000
I could bring up Last.fm, type in synth pop,

980
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:49,000
run it on my 360, and clean my living room.

981
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,000
Actually, okay, we all know it would be Spice Girls,

982
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:54,000
but, you know, I'm saying, whatever you want.

983
00:48:54,000 --> 00:49:00,000
Synth pop and Spice Girls mixed together would be epic.

984
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,000
Very epic.

985
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,000
And Tiger Claw also confirms that the music stops playing

986
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:05,000
when you exit out of it.

987
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:07,000
So it sounds like it's kind of like an independent application,

988
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:09,000
kind of like Netflix is, basically.

989
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:11,000
Like, the movies stop when you leave Netflix.

990
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:13,000
Like, all the programs are kind of like that, too,

991
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,000
like, you know, the Twitter and stuff,

992
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:17,000
it kind of goes into its own program thing,

993
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:19,000
and then you actually back out to the main menu

994
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:21,000
when you're done.

995
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,000
Whatever, I mean, if I really am that desperate

996
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,000
to check, you know, Twitter and stuff,

997
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,000
I guess that would be handy.

998
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,000
It might be useful, like, if I, whatever,

999
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,000
go on the road or something like that

1000
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,000
and I have my Xbox 360 and I don't have, like,

1001
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:35,000
you know, my laptop or something like that,

1002
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,000
that might be important.

1003
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,000
It might be about, you know, hey, you know,

1004
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,000
where are you guys going to be at this time,

1005
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,000
or something like that.

1006
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:45,000
You know, assuming that I don't have their cell phone number

1007
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:47,000
or something like that, because I would just use my cell phone.

1008
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,000
But, um, it might be neat.

1009
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,000
But then again, after all this stuff is in here and stuff,

1010
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,000
I have to wonder,

1011
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,000
why the hell is there not an internet browser yet?

1012
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:57,000
That is very, very good question.

1013
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,000
That is one thing that Xbox is, like,

1014
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,000
sorely lacking, and these are the people

1015
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,000
that make Internet Explorer.

1016
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,000
Why?

1017
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,000
Is there not, unless,

1018
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,000
you know, because Internet Explorer is,

1019
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,000
you know, kind of a magnet for bugs

1020
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:13,000
and all sorts of exploits and whatnot

1021
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:15,000
that they're worried that somehow they're going to

1022
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,000
find a way around.

1023
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:19,000
Oh, people playing, like, emulated games,

1024
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:21,000
like, Nintendo games in a Flash browser

1025
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,000
or something, you know?

1026
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:25,000
Is that what they're worried about, maybe?

1027
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:27,000
Maybe. But I would think, though, with maybe Facebook

1028
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:29,000
or something, you might be able to kind of exploit something, too.

1029
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:31,000
You know, I never even thought to do that on the Playstation,

1030
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:33,000
because the Playstation has a decent web browser.

1031
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,000
But is it just me, or

1032
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:37,000
are both the Playstation and the Wii

1033
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,000
their web browsers? It's kind of clunky.

1034
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,000
Like, they just don't work like it does on a computer.

1035
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,000
And, I don't know,

1036
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:45,000
especially when I'm using, like, the YouTube TV site,

1037
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,000
like, they're so slow to load.

1038
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:49,000
That's been the hang-up

1039
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:51,000
of any type of web system

1040
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,000
on a console.

1041
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:55,000
I mean, really. You think, I mean,

1042
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,000
but isn't the PS3 supposed to be a computer?

1043
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:59,000
So they said, I think they did it

1044
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:01,000
just for the tax cut, remember?

1045
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:03,000
I guess. I don't know, they seem

1046
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:05,000
a little clunky to me, because I love doing,

1047
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:07,000
like, you know, you guys have been to my house,

1048
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,000
and, you know, like, when I have a lot of

1049
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,000
people over, we'll fire up YouTube

1050
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,000
and watch funny things, and it's really good

1051
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:15,000
to be able to do it on the Wii or the Playstation 3.

1052
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:17,000
You know, I love that new YouTube channel,

1053
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,000
but it's slow and clunky.

1054
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:21,000
You know what I say, if you want to run anything off the internet

1055
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:23,000
on your TV, build a multimedia

1056
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:25,000
box.

1057
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:27,000
I guess, but... Especially now with an HDTV,

1058
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,000
it's so

1059
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:31,000
cheap and

1060
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,000
easy to do.

1061
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:35,000
DJ Dark Knight does say in chat,

1062
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,000
I do like how on Last.fm they do have

1063
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:39,000
video game music stations. I wasn't aware of that.

1064
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,000
That's kinda interesting.

1065
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:43,000
So I'm gonna have to check this out. You know I'm going on, like,

1066
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:45,000
60 days since I've played on Xbox 360.

1067
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,000
I'm like, I've been all Playstation 3

1068
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:49,000
lately, so...

1069
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:51,000
Very interesting. Anyhow,

1070
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,000
speaking of Playstation 3, I signed into home,

1071
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:55,000
and there were, like, six requests to join our club,

1072
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:57,000
so I approved them all, so if you want to join the

1073
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:59,000
Sony home club

1074
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:01,000
for Orange Lounge Radio, look for us on the

1075
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:03,000
search and at us

1076
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,000
before we fill up.

1077
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:07,000
Moving on to another game

1078
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:09,000
story about Fable 3.

1079
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:11,000
Fable 3, a couple of things

1080
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,000
about this. There will be an in-game

1081
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:15,000
shop with microtransactions

1082
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,000
in Fable 3. I'm sure this is

1083
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,000
no surprise at all.

1084
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:21,000
But what they're doing, they're kind of integrating this

1085
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:23,000
in-game shop in the game world,

1086
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:25,000
and you buy the download content in

1087
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:27,000
this shop with the experience.

1088
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:29,000
In other words,

1089
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:31,000
you don't pop up a new screen that takes

1090
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:33,000
you to the Xbox Live Marketplace.

1091
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,000
In my mind, this is kind of similar to what Rock Band 2

1092
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:37,000
did a little while ago. That's kind of

1093
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:39,000
very integrated into the game, but of course

1094
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,000
Rock Band's a very different type of game than

1095
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:43,000
Fable 3, so it'll be interesting.

1096
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:45,000
And they are saying

1097
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:47,000
that possibly one idea

1098
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:49,000
is that special weapons could sell

1099
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:51,000
for $1.70.

1100
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:53,000
This is starting to tread into dangerous

1101
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:55,000
territory, though. I don't like the idea

1102
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:57,000
that I could spend real money

1103
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:59,000
at the touch of a button for

1104
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,000
weapon upgrades.

1105
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:03,000
I mean, this is starting to get a little cheap.

1106
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:05,000
That's getting silly.

1107
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:07,000
I'm sorry, here's my problem with it.

1108
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,000
It's Fable 3, and I'm sorry.

1109
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:11,000
Luckily for me,

1110
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:13,000
I didn't play Fable 1. I played

1111
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,000
Fable 2, and I learned my lesson

1112
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:17,000
not to trust Peter Molyneaux for

1113
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:19,000
crap, and I don't get it

1114
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:21,000
because I really enjoyed Fable 2.

1115
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:23,000
It was one of my favorite games that year it came out.

1116
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:25,000
No, I got bored with it really fast.

1117
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:27,000
That's where we have differing opinions

1118
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:29,000
on Long Long Radio. Exactly, and Fable 3

1119
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:31,000
I'm sorry, they're going to start doing this in the

1120
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:33,000
tall stuff. They're going to have this

1121
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:35,000
store in there, and yeah, I know I don't have to buy any

1122
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:37,000
of this stuff, but

1123
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:39,000
I'm just going to bypass the whole game altogether.

1124
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:41,000
Unless there's something that's really

1125
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:43,000
awesome that I must play in this.

1126
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:45,000
I mean, I

1127
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:47,000
guess it's where we're going to be going

1128
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:49,000
with it. I mean, so...

1129
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:51,000
It's the trend that's showing

1130
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:53,000
up that I'm getting really nervous about.

1131
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:55,000
But the bottom line is, if you don't like it, don't buy it.

1132
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:57,000
Show them that you're not going to support it.

1133
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,000
That's really what it boils down to in the end.

1134
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:01,000
But it's just kind of sad that it's going there in the

1135
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:03,000
first place. I'm still going to buy Fable 3. I loved

1136
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:05,000
Fable 2, and the first Fable was good too.

1137
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:07,000
You know, no matter what, I'm going to buy it,

1138
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:09,000
but

1139
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:11,000
this is a little ridiculous.

1140
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:13,000
I'll just get my upgrades naturally. I know, I don't

1141
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,000
like it for these

1142
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:17,000
super great weapons

1143
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:19,000
that you can, you know,

1144
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:21,000
that are better than the ones you

1145
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:23,000
get in the game normally. Like, if World of Warcraft

1146
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,000
ever did this, this is what I'm really worried about,

1147
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:27,000
is MMOs going this route where World of Warcraft

1148
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:29,000
sells the Uber weapon.

1149
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:31,000
Like, that'll be the day I leave World of Warcraft.

1150
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:33,000
Because that's kind of bold that somebody would be able

1151
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:35,000
to pay money and get the weapon.

1152
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:37,000
Yeah, I agree. You know, although I

1153
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:39,000
suppose one could argue they can do that now

1154
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:41,000
and pay a gold farmer to buy the

1155
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:43,000
crafted stuff, but... By the way,

1156
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:45,000
something that didn't make our show this week, but I want to say

1157
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:47,000
it really quick, because I want to applaud Blizzard,

1158
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,000
finally kind of did a little campaign

1159
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:51,000
against gold sellers this week, and basically

1160
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:53,000
coming out and saying, look, if you support gold selling,

1161
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:55,000
you are supporting the hacking of people's

1162
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,000
accounts. You know, you're supporting all this stuff.

1163
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:59,000
Did I even talk about on this show

1164
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:01,000
that my WoW account was hacked a couple weeks ago?

1165
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:03,000
Did I? Okay. And it sucks.

1166
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:05,000
It totally sucks when something like that happens.

1167
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:07,000
So, I totally agree with their stance.

1168
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:09,000
If you buy gold online, you suck.

1169
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:11,000
Because you're supporting

1170
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:13,000
this practice of

1171
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:15,000
hacking accounts like mine, and supporting

1172
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:17,000
keyloggers and funding this,

1173
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:19,000
basically. So, don't buy gold

1174
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:21,000
online.

1175
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:23,000
One other thing I wanted to state, although

1176
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:25,000
Matt kind of stated it. It was circulated also

1177
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:27,000
this week. Project Natal will be

1178
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:29,000
supported in Fable 3. That, of course, should come

1179
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:31,000
as no surprise at all, since

1180
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:33,000
Peter Molyneux was, of course, out there

1181
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:35,000
at E3 this year, kind of,

1182
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:37,000
you know, promoting Project

1183
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,000
Natal, but there will be support for it in Fable 3.

1184
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:41,000
What will it do?

1185
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:43,000
I don't know.

1186
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:45,000
Wait until the game comes out.

1187
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:47,000
That's what it does.

1188
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:49,000
I don't know.

1189
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:51,000
Well, you know, there's something else going on

1190
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:53,000
that's, I think, a little stinky.

1191
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:55,000
Very much like the weapon upgrade business.

1192
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:57,000
And that's, um,

1193
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:59,000
there's a game that's called

1194
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:01,000
Parachute Panic that's on

1195
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:03,000
iPhone and iPod Touch.

1196
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:05,000
And, achoo!

1197
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:07,000
And achoo! And I'm allergic to it.

1198
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:09,000
Um, actually, there's dust in the room.

1199
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:11,000
Um, but now you, um,

1200
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:13,000
on the last version that came out,

1201
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:15,000
you can pay 99 cents to unlock

1202
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:17,000
another five lives.

1203
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:19,000
And it's a 99 cent game already.

1204
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:21,000
So, I mean,

1205
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:23,000
you can just

1206
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:25,000
do it in-game, but for the impatient

1207
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:27,000
people who want more lives, then

1208
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:29,000
you just pay for it. I think it's kind of stupid.

1209
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:31,000
And,

1210
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:33,000
this is, again,

1211
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:35,000
this kind of goes right in line with the Fable 3 story.

1212
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:37,000
You know, it's paying for

1213
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:39,000
something that,

1214
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:41,000
kind of a cheap upgrade

1215
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:43,000
in the game, I guess. But,

1216
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:45,000
if you don't like it, don't buy it.

1217
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:47,000
It's a crappy precedent to be setting.

1218
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:49,000
Because, unfortunately,

1219
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:51,000
if one person buys it,

1220
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:53,000
they're like, hey, that's a dollar I didn't have before

1221
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:55,000
to sell something like this.

1222
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:57,000
No, I agree. I think it's really just

1223
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:59,000
encouraging gamer laziness,

1224
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:01,000
really.

1225
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:03,000
It's kind of like EA and their cheat codes, remember?

1226
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:05,000
Stuff that normally would be in a game for free.

1227
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:07,000
You can sell it for two bucks.

1228
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:09,000
Win-win.

1229
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:11,000
I'm not,

1230
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:13,000
I don't have as much of a problem with it

1231
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:15,000
if it's something that you can achieve in the game

1232
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:17,000
otherwise, especially single player.

1233
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:19,000
Keep in mind when I ranted about, wow,

1234
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:21,000
that's a multiplayer experience,

1235
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:23,000
and much different. But a single player

1236
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:25,000
game, you know what, if you want to use

1237
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:27,000
cheats to your heart's content

1238
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:29,000
in a single player game, where you're not

1239
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:31,000
interacting with other people going online or what have you,

1240
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:33,000
go for it. And if you want to pay two bucks

1241
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:35,000
because you're too lazy to get it yourself, fine.

1242
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:37,000
But as long as the option

1243
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:39,000
is there for you to still get it yourself

1244
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:41,000
and work towards it, I think it's okay.

1245
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:43,000
It's just not something I would probably do.

1246
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:45,000
I think it's more fun if you,

1247
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:47,000
you know, I think anything worth having is worth

1248
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:49,000
working for. Even if

1249
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:51,000
it's in a game or not.

1250
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:53,000
I am behind on some chat room

1251
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:55,000
comments, so I want to read some comments from our chat room.

1252
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:57,000
chat.orangelaungeradio.com

1253
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:59,000
Salacious Pop says,

1254
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:01,000
it could just be rose colored glasses

1255
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:03,000
but Dreamcast's browser was pretty good.

1256
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:05,000
Kind of going back a ways back.

1257
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:07,000
Actually, yeah, it was decent. For the time.

1258
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:09,000
You know, you have to kind of say, okay, well,

1259
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:11,000
you know, that was 1999, this is

1260
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:13,000
before kind of web browsers were

1261
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:15,000
standard like that. What did Dreamcast browser

1262
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:17,000
have to compete with? Web TV?

1263
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:19,000
Yeah. So yeah, I think for its time,

1264
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:21,000
it was certainly pretty good.

1265
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:23,000
Let's see, Reddertainment says, the store

1266
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:25,000
in Fable 3 will be good, but the store in Fable 4

1267
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:27,000
will be awesome.

1268
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:29,000
Let's hope that it's not more of this

1269
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:31,000
technical and diming stuff, but I'm sure it will be.

1270
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:33,000
Also a question from

1271
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:35,000
Reddertainment, if Natal gets delayed,

1272
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:37,000
will Fable 3 get delayed?

1273
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:39,000
And Seg replies with his thought,

1274
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:41,000
maybe not, unless Microsoft wants it as a

1275
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:43,000
launch product. I assume Fable 3 is an

1276
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:45,000
add-on support for Natal rather than a

1277
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:47,000
requirement. So I guess, yeah,

1278
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:49,000
that's a good thought. It depends on how much Natal

1279
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:51,000
is integrated into this game. If it's like

1280
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:53,000
a required part of the game, then

1281
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:55,000
yeah, Natal delay is going to affect the game,

1282
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:57,000
but if it's just kind of a

1283
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:59,000
bonus little game or a bonus

1284
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:01,000
little quest, then maybe not.

1285
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:03,000
I could see that kind of being the case, is that

1286
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:05,000
there's a download expansion that uses Natal

1287
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:07,000
or something like that. It'll be kind of

1288
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:09,000
interesting, I suppose.

1289
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:11,000
So, alright.

1290
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:13,000
Well, moving right along

1291
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:15,000
into some release dates. Loki,

1292
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:17,000
take us through the US releases this week.

1293
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:19,000
Yeah, lots of good stuff this week. Of course,

1294
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:21,000
we were talking about DJ Hero

1295
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:23,000
earlier, and

1296
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:25,000
that will be making its way out this week

1297
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:27,000
on all four systems, and of course, the

1298
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:29,000
Renegade Edition coming out on

1299
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:31,000
the PlayStation 3, Xbox 360,

1300
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:33,000
and the Wii. Also,

1301
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:35,000
coming out this week, we've got

1302
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:37,000

1303
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:39,000
3 and Xbox 360,

1304
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:41,000
as well as the Fight Stick bundles for those.

1305
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:43,000

1307
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:47,000

1308
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:49,000

1309
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:51,000
coming out this week on the Wii and DS.

or Square on DS, Xbox

1312
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:57,000
360, and the Wii.

1313
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:59,000
We've also got...

1314
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:03,000
probably not from any of our listeners,

1315
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:05,000
but Nihau, Kylan,

1316
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:07,000
Super Game Day on the Wii

1317
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:09,000
for your Nick Jr. fans.

1318
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:11,000
You read a lot of game releases that

1319
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:13,000
I don't think a single one of OLR listeners

1320
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:15,000
care about. Hey, they may have kids that watch Nick Jr.

1321
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:17,000
and that is important. Just saying.

1322
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:19,000
Just saying. Also, the Backyard

1323
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:21,000
Again is another Nick Jr. program.

1324
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:23,000

with the scope

1327
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:29,000
that's going to be coming out in a bundle for the Wii.

1328
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:31,000
Borderlands on PC

1329
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:33,000
also making its way out this week.

1330
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:35,000

and Xbox 360.

1333
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:41,000
Pets, Dolphins,

1334
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:43,000
and Counters on the DS.

1335
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:45,000
Once again, another game series that puts

1336
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:47,000
out tons of games and I'm sure they don't

1337
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:49,000
sell very well, but hey, you know what?

1338
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:51,000
They're putting them out and people pick them up.

1339
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:53,000
Barbie and the

1340
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:55,000
Three Musketeers on DS and Wii.

1341
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:57,000
Monster

1342
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:59,000
4x4 Stunt Racer

1343
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:01,000
with a pack-in wheel

1344
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:03,000
coming to the Wii.

1345
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:05,000
Drawn to Life, the next chapter, also on Wii

1346
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:07,000
and DS this time.

1347
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:09,000
Diner Dash Flow on the Go

1348
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:11,000
is still the best title for the DS

1349
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:13,000
title. Wow.

1350
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:15,000
I know.

1351
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:17,000
I was just here going, uh...

1352
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:19,000
Some ladies might have to make a dash out of the diner

1353
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:21,000
with Flow on the Go.

1354
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:23,000
No one wants Flow on the Go.

1355
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:25,000
That's always a bad thing.

1356
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:27,000
Ben 10, Alien Force, Vilgax Attacks

1357
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:29,000
on Playstation 2, Wii, and

1358
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:31,000
DS and PSP.

1359
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:33,000
Forza

1360
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:35,000
Motorsport 3 on

1361
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:37,000
Xbox 360.

1362
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:39,000
CSI Deadly Intent on

1363
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:41,000
DS and Wii.

1364
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:43,000
I think PS3 and Xbox 360 as well.

1365
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:45,000
This one's for Rob.

1366
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:47,000
Press Your Luck 2010

1367
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:49,000
coming out on PC, Wii, and

1368
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:51,000
I believe

1369
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:53,000
DS as well.

1370
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:55,000
But if it's not Peter Tamarkin, then I don't give a crap

1371
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:57,000
and I don't see how that'll be possible because he's

1372
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:59,000
kinda dead.

1373
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:01,000
What's his name?

1374
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:03,000
Todd Newton. Can't stand him.

1375
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:05,000
He's like the worst game show host ever.

1376
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:07,000
Reanimation. Ruined Whammy.

1377
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:09,000
And going back to the roots of this show, Dance Dance Revolution

1378
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:11,000
Hot Party 3 making its way out

1379
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:13,000
from Konami. Of course, all these

1380
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:15,000
games now kinda blend together because they all

1381
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:17,000
kinda suck.

1382
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:19,000
I believe also

1383
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:21,000
kinda go with that. DDRX2

1384
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:23,000
will be coming out as well in the bundle

1385
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:25,000
on Playstation 2. They only sell these

1386
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:27,000
games in a bundle now because they want you to buy those

1387
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:29,000
crappy dance pads to go with them.

1388
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:31,000
And Hamster

1389
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:33,000
or Pets Hamster's Bunch

1390
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:35,000
on PSP because god forbid

1391
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:37,000
if the PSP be devoid of

1392
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:39,000
crappy pet games.

1393
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:41,000
And

1394
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:43,000
Dream Salon on DS.

1395
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:45,000
Now that's gonna be crap.

1396
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:47,000
And finally, stuff coming out a week

1397
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:49,000
from now.

1398
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:53,000
Rabbids Go Home would be

1399
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:55,000
the last. Oh, Ratchet and Clank

1400
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:57,000
Crack in Time. That's another title that'll be coming out

1401
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:59,000
this week as well. I gotta read some comments

1402
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:01,000
from chat. If you're done. I'm done.

1403
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:03,000
Dart Tetsuya says, Sky, three words.

1404
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:05,000
Zombie Peter Tamarkin.

1405
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:07,000
Awesome.

1406
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:09,000
Let's see, what else was said here? Oh, Salacious

1407
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:11,000
Pop says, I'd play a Nick Jr.

1408
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:13,000
Eureka's Castle FPS.

1409
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:15,000
Hell yeah.

1410
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:17,000
Where are the, yeah, exactly, where are the

1411
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:19,000
Nickelodeon games for me?

1412
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:21,000
Screw the children.

1413
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:23,000
I want my Nickelodeon games.

1414
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:25,000
Like, for instance, can I get like a

1415
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:27,000
you can't do that on television minigame collection?

1416
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:29,000
Or like,

1417
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:31,000
Hey dude. Hey dude, explore the ranch

1418
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:33,000
game. Or

1419
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:35,000
Salute your shorts. Salute your shorts.

1420
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:37,000
You know, are you afraid of the dark?

1421
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:39,000
The best episode of Salute your shorts

1422
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:41,000
had to have been was at the

1423
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:43,000
water balloon capture the flag

1424
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:45,000
episode. My favorite.

1425
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:47,000
Thank you, Seg.

1426
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:49,000
Legends of the Hidden Temple.

1427
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:51,000
Guts. Actually, they did have a Guts game

1428
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:53,000
on Super Nintendo, didn't they? Nick Arcade.

1429
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:55,000
Yeah, I know. How about reviving one of these

1430
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:57,000
old, like, classic frickin'

1431
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:59,000
for all I care, do a fucking

1432
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:01,000
today's special video game. I don't care.

1433
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:03,000
Just give me something I remember from my childhood.

1434
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:05,000
David the Gnome.

1435
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:07,000
The Gnome was great. Turkey Television.

1436
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:09,000
Tell me

1437
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:11,000
you wouldn't play a Turkey Television, like, shooting

1438
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:13,000
game. It'd be amazing.

1439
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:15,000
Well, they do have Chicken Shoot. That's kinda close.

1440
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:17,000
I guess so.

1441
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:19,000
Alright, let's go to Japanese release dates.

1442
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:21,000
Is there anything that's gonna make us go

1443
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:23,000
crazy this week? Probably

1444
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:25,000
not, because Japan's getting a lot of the titles that are

1445
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:27,000
big and expected for us over here

1446
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:29,000
this week. And Japanese releases this week on the

1447
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:31,000
Xbox 360. Bayonetta makes its way

1448
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:33,000
to the Xbox 360

1449
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:35,000
on October 29th, as well as Tekken 6.

1450
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:37,000
Of course, it's a big deal over there, just

1451
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:39,000
as it is over here. Those both coming out to

1452
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:41,000
the Xbox 360. And, of course, just in time

1453
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:43,000
for Tekken 6, another hoary

1454
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:45,000
arcade stick with the Tekken 6 design on it.

1455
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:47,000
If you'd care to import one

1456
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:49,000
of those from Japan. Or you can just get them here

1457
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:51,000
in the bundle. Fine. Or on

1458
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:53,000
the PlayStation 3, you could get a Bayonetta

1459
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:55,000
there, or the, again, Tekken

1460
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:57,000
6. There's also a game getting a price

1461
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:59,000
reduction. That's Samurai Dou 3

1462
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:01,000
Plus getting a price reduction this week.

1463
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:03,000
So those are the big releases on the

1464
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:05,000
360 PS3 combo.

1465
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:07,000
Now, dipping into Nintendo Wii, we have some

1466
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:09,000
different alternate titles. Another Dragon

1467
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:11,000
Ball title. I'm sorry, that's

1468
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:13,000
a US date. Chin Sports makes its

1469
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:15,000
way to Japan. This is kind of

1470
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:17,000
a mini-game collection that's wacky and weird

1471
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:19,000
sports. This is the one that has

1472
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:21,000
the Extreme Ironing. I think we talked

1473
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:23,000
about this on the show. Oh, Wacky World of Sports? Yeah, remember we talked about, I think

1474
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:25,000
this came up on the show a few weeks ago. It came out last month.

1475
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:27,000
Yeah, for here in the US.

1476
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:29,000
The Japanese are getting their own version

1477
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:31,000
of that. Probably what people

1478
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:33,000
care a little more about would be Sin and Punishment 2.

1479
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:35,000
That is finally being released on the Nintendo Wii

1480
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:37,000
this week. Super Robot

1481
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:39,000
Taisen Nioh comes out as well, because there

1482
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:41,000
just wasn't enough Super Robot

1483
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:43,000
Taisen games. So another one is coming

1484
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:45,000
out on the Wii this week. Heading on over to

1485
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:47,000
the DS and looking at some of the games coming out

1486
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:49,000
there on the DS,

1487
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:51,000
we have Hakari No. 4 Senshi

1488
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:53,000
Final Fantasy Gaiden comes

1489
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:55,000
out on the DS. So yes, this is from

1490
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:57,000
Squeenix. It's that Final Fantasy

1491
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:59,000
DS title that doesn't look very

1492
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:01,000
Final Fantasy to me at all. It's kind of like

1493
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:03,000
a spin-off game. In this game, you try

1494
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:05,000
to defeat the Witch of the North. That's what a Gaiden is

1495
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:07,000
as a side story. Yeah, and it's

1496
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:09,000
that same style of like Final Fantasy

1497
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:11,000
3 DS and the Final Fantasy 12

1498
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:13,000
spin-off game, but don't expect

1499
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:15,000
it to play like

1500
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:17,000
your other Final Fantasy games. It's a little bit

1501
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:19,000
different.

1502
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:21,000
You know what I miss as far as Final Fantasy

1503
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:23,000
spin-off games go? You know what my favorite,

1504
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:25,000
like seriously, my favorite Final Fantasy

1505
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:27,000
spin-off game was? Tease me all you want.

1506
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:29,000
I fucking love Chocobo Racing.

1507
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:31,000
That game is amazing. No, I know

1508
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:33,000
a lot of people who love that one. I wish they would make another

1509
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:35,000
one. I love that game.

1510
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:37,000
It was perfect for the Wii.

1511
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:39,000
Or give me my extreme

1512
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:41,000
Chocobo Racing on the PlayStation 3

1513
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:43,000
just in time for Final Fantasy 13.

1514
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:45,000
You know, you reminded me, I forgot two major

1515
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:47,000
titles and I don't understand how I did that.

1516
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:49,000
Fairy Tail Fights is coming out on Xbox 360

1517
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:51,000
and PlayStation 3. Dude, how

1518
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:53,000
did I forget this? Grand Theft Auto Episodes of

1519
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:55,000
Liberty City on Xbox 360

1520
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:57,000
this week. Fail. Cause I think most people think

1521
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:59,000
of that as a download title.

1522
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:01,000
It's still gonna be awesome.

1523
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:03,000
Fairy Tail Fighters, is that what it

1524
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:05,000
sounds like? No, Fairy Tail Fights. Think of it

1525
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:07,000
as like, um,

1526
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:09,000
Castle Crashers but with Fairy Tail characters.

1527
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:11,000
It's brutal. It's like

1528
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:13,000
blood and guts everywhere. Oh, you talked about this on a

1529
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:15,000
previous show. This sounded awesome.

1530
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:17,000
I'm gonna have to check that out. Is it

1531
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:19,000
cheap or is it like 60 bucks? I think it's

1532
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:21,000
like 50. I'll wait

1533
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:23,000
for the bargain bin cause that's...

1534
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:25,000
You wanna talk about a game that'll end up in the bargain bin?

1535
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:27,000
Let's see. We can't really sell

1536
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:29,000
this game to children and adults

1537
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:31,000
probably won't take it very seriously either.

1538
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:33,000
Uh, we could market this to the people

1539
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:35,000
that bought the Red Riding Hood Zombie game

1540
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:37,000
on the DS. That's probably

1541
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:39,000
the target market for this.

1542
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:41,000
It's gotta be the same company, right?

1543
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:43,000
Nope. Right? That was Zoo

1544
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:45,000
Games. It did, um,

1545
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:47,000
Red Riding Hood

1546
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:49,000
Zombie BBQ. Yeah,

1547
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:51,000
that was it. That was the best name ever, by the way. That was an awesome game.

1548
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:53,000
I played it at PAX, I think. It was either PAX

1549
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:55,000
or E3. Uh,

1550
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:57,000
it was PAX.

1551
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:59,000
Um,

1552
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:01,000
and SalaciousPop reminded me

1553
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:03,000
in chat there saying I only got maybe

1554
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:05,000
seven to eight hours in the Tactics titles.

1555
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:07,000
I suppose Final Fantasy Tactics is a pretty notable

1556
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:09,000
spinoff of the Final Fantasy series. Yeah.

1557
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:11,000
But you know what's sad? I probably spent

1558
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:13,000
more time playing Chocobo Racing than the Final

1559
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:15,000
Fantasy Tactics games.

1560
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:17,000
That's for sure. Uh,

1561
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:19,000
specifically I wanted to mention on the PSP just because

1562
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:21,000
I think this name is hilarious. It's

1563
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:23,000
R-Type Tactics 2. Yes,

1564
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:25,000
the R-Type Tactical game, remember that,

1565
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:27,000
is actually getting a sequel. And the

1566
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:29,000
sequel is called Operation

1567
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:31,000
Bitter Chocolate.

1568
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:33,000
I can't make that up. That is the real name of the game.

1569
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:35,000
Operation Bitter Chocolate.

1570
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:37,000
So would that be Dark Chocolate? Baker's Chocolate?

1571
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:39,000
I don't know. It's just...

1572
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:41,000
That's what it's called. Operation Semi-Sweet

1573
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:43,000
Chocolate. With a little bit of nuts.

1574
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:45,000
Operation... I don't get it.

1575
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:47,000
Couple more news stories for you

1576
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:49,000

Fallout 3 Game of the Year edition,

1583
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:03,000
Football Manager 2010,

1584
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:05,000
Tekken 6, Feel,

1585
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:07,000
that sounds dirty, Wii Fit

1586
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:09,000
Plus, and Yoga for Wii.

1587
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:11,000
Alright, we're gonna

1588
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:13,000
get to the Classic Game of the Week very, very

1589
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:15,000
soon here, but just two more stories for you guys

1590
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:17,000
real quick, and then the break, and then our interview

1591
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:19,000
with our pal Seg about

1592
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:21,000
Unloud right after the break tonight.

1593
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:23,000
You know, since we

1594
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:25,000
were talking a little bit about

1595
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:27,000
Fairytale Fights, they did have an achievement at one

1596
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:29,000
point for killing children in this.

1597
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:31,000
So not to be outdone, of course,

1598
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:33,000
Dante's Inferno, the game

1599
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:35,000
full of great ideas and awesome

1600
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:37,000
promotions,

1601
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:39,000
is now getting some

1602
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:41,000
flak for

1603
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:43,000
an achievement called Bad Nanny.

1604
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:45,000
And this achievement

1605
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:47,000
is... You've been a very bad

1606
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:49,000
nanny, I can just see a super nanny.

1607
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:51,000
This achievement is... You need to go and

1608
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:53,000
sit on the naughty step.

1609
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:55,000
You've been very naughty.

1610
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:57,000
Apparently this achievement is for killing unbaptized

1611
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:59,000
babies in the game.

1612
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:01,000
But they're demon babies,

1613
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:03,000
they're in hell, okay? Oh, well that makes it okay.

1614
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:05,000
They're demon babies, but apparently, you know,

1615
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:07,000
the International

1616
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:09,000
Nanny Association, I

1617
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:11,000
can't make that up, has

1618
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:13,000
released a statement saying

1619
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:15,000
that it's an offense to our

1620
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:17,000
association.

1621
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:19,000
Do they not have

1622
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:21,000
a sense of humor? I mean, this isn't saying

1623
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:23,000
that, you know, Bad

1624
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:25,000
International Nanny Association

1625
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:27,000
or something like that. My mom was

1626
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:29,000
a nanny, actually, for many, many years,

1627
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:31,000
and I can verify they do not have a sense

1628
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:33,000
of humor. Actually,

1629
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:35,000
my mom's hilarious, but I don't think she'd find that

1630
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:37,000
funny. Your mom's a hoot.

1631
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:39,000
It's a video game about

1632
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:41,000
hell. I mean, they've got walls

1633
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:43,000
made out of writhing naked people.

1634
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:45,000
I mean, this isn't exactly,

1635
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:47,000
this isn't saying you should go kill babies.

1636
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:49,000
Just demon babies.

1637
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:51,000
Are you saying we should go kill babies?

1638
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:53,000
Demon babies, okay?

1639
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:55,000
I mean, look at Silent Hill with the

1640
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:57,000
smoke babies. I mean, yes, you need to kill

1641
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:59,000
them because they're not human.

1642
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:01,000
They're trying to eat you.

1643
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:03,000
Or something.

1644
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:05,000
Cats aren't human. Do you kill them?

1645
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:07,000
No, I don't kill them.

1646
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:09,000
But they're not demon babies, either.

1647
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:11,000
Well, sometimes they are, but

1648
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:13,000
most of the time, they're not.

1649
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:15,000
Comment from xlink in chat chat

1650
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:17,000
dot orange orange radio dot com. They say no to

1651
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:19,000
this, but you can shoot kids in Fallout 3.

1652
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:21,000
Hmm.

1653
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:23,000
Those kids had it

1654
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:25,000
coming.

1655
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:27,000
Shut up.

1656
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:29,000
Alright, speaking of things, I told you

1657
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:31,000
we're coming before too long on a completely

1658
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:33,000
different note. Remember when I said

1659
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:35,000
don't discount Facebook gaming?

1660
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:37,000
Uh oh.

1661
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:39,000
There is a big, big new game coming to

1662
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:41,000
Facebook. Civilization Network

1663
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:43,000
has been announced for Facebook, and in my opinion,

1664
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:45,000
this is huge, because this is

1665
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:47,000
what it sounds like. It is a major

1666
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:49,000
PC beloved franchise

1667
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:51,000
colliding with the world of Facebook

1668
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:53,000
games, and some of you are preparing your

1669
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:55,000
block application thing on Facebook right

1670
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:57,000
now, which, by the way, tangent warning.

1671
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:59,000
What the hell is up with those changes

1672
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:01,000
on Facebook?

1673
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:03,000
What changes?

1674
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:05,000
Ok, now they've changed it, so when you log in, you get

1675
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:07,000
like a news feed that seems to be like a

1676
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:09,000
random sampling of the stuff that you would see

1677
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:11,000
before, like the popular stories.

1678
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:13,000
If you want to see the live feed, you have to

1679
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:15,000
click into that, but now the live feed

1680
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:17,000
shows not just people's updates, but like

1681
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:19,000
who became friends with who,

1682
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:21,000
and all this stuff that you really don't want to see.

1683
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:23,000
All the stuff we don't care about.

1684
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:25,000
Yay, more stuff we get to block.

1685
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:27,000
But you can't block it, because if you block it, then

1686
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:29,000
you block the person that did the friending.

1687
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:31,000
So yeah, Facebook didn't think that one through.

1688
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:33,000
I know, exactly, Facebook didn't think that one through very well.

1689
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:35,000
Anyhow, sorry, I digress.

1690
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:37,000
Civilization Network is making its way

1691
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:39,000
to Facebook, and it's supposed to be out sometime

1692
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:41,000
in 2010. There's actually a

1693
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:43,000
Facebook page already set up.

1694
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:45,000
It's on facebook.com

1695
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:47,000
slash civnetwork, C-I-V

1696
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:49,000
network, and they're going to be on the

1697
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:51,000
lookout for beta testers very soon.

1698
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:53,000
Sid Meier himself has said that the

1699
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:55,000
game will offer everything that people

1700
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:57,000
love about Civ in a quote

1701
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:59,000
fully persistent environment.

1702
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:01,000
Best of all, the game

1703
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:03,000
will be free.

1704
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:05,000
I like free.

1705
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:07,000
Brian Reynolds, who is behind Civilization 2

1706
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:09,000
and Alpha Centauri, has

1707
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:11,000
the job of chief designer at

1708
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:13,000
the social gaming developer site

1709
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:15,000
Zynga. It's kind of an interesting

1710
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:17,000
little coincidence. He has nothing to do with this game,

1711
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:19,000
but it's interesting

1712
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:21,000
that he did so much with that now he's at this

1713
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:23,000
other company, so you think maybe old friends maybe

1714
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:25,000
got together at dinner talking about this, who knows.

1715
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:27,000
But Facebook

1716
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:29,000
gaming dude, it's

1717
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:31,000
coming. This is going to be something we're going to

1718
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:33,000
see in the next few months, just get bigger and bigger.

1719
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:35,000
Yep.

1720
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:37,000
Alright, now we're going to get into a section of the show

1721
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:39,000
that we like to get into every week. It's a section

1722
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:41,000
for Dark Sakura to open up the gaming vault

1723
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:43,000
and take a travel through

1724
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:45,000
gaming's past. It's a segment we call

1725
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:47,000
the Classic Game of the

1726
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:49,000
Week. Dark Sakura, what video game do

1727
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:51,000
you think the kids should be playing this week?

1728
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:53,000
For those in the US,

1729
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:55,000
it is Galactic Attack.

1730
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:57,000
It has been

1731
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:59,000
known by many other names.

1732
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:01,000
In

1733
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:03,000
Japan, in the arcade, it was called

1734
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:05,000
Ray Force, but because of licensing

1735
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:07,000
it came out as a layer section

1736
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:09,000
on the Saturn. We got it

1737
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:11,000
as Galactic Attack, and in Europe they got it

1738
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:13,000
as Gun Lock. But it is

1739
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:15,000
in the Ray

1740
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:17,000
series, Ray Force, Ray

1741
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:19,000
Storm, and Ray Crisis.

1742
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:21,000
It's a pretty freaking amazing shooting

1743
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:23,000
game.

1744
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:25,000
I love the way that it plays because

1745
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:27,000
not only do you have the stuff coming from you

1746
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:29,000
from right above, you also target

1747
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:31,000
below your ship

1748
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:33,000
and can launch

1749
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:35,000
missiles at targets in the

1750
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:37,000
background, or as it should be

1751
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:39,000
toward the bottom.

1752
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:41,000
Do you want to add something to that?

1753
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:43,000
No, unless you want to hear some of the

1754
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:45,000
lovely little shooting sound effects here.

1755
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:51,000
At least it's good.

1756
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:53,000
Definitely sounds like a shooting game.

1757
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:55,000
Bullets, bullets, and more bullets.

1758
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:57,000
It really is. It is

1759
01:14:57,000 --> 01:14:59,000
just one of the

1760
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:01,000
regular old

1761
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:03,000
shooting games.

1762
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:05,000
I think it's one of Taito's best.

1763
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:07,000
I love the entire

1764
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:09,000
series.

1765
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:11,000
Ray Storm and Ray Crisis

1766
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:13,000
were fantastic, but

1767
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:15,000
this, to me, I think is what really

1768
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:17,000
gave it to us.

1769
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:19,000
It's, to this day, one of my favorite

1770
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:21,000
shooters and one of the reasons to have

1771
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:23,000
a rotating widescreen monitor.

1772
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:25,000
That's it.

1773
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:27,000
Alright.

1774
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:29,000
So there it is, your classic game of the week.

1775
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:31,000
It goes by several different names, right?

1776
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:33,000
We have Galactic Attack in the US.

1777
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:35,000
Gunlock in Europe.

1778
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:37,000
Layer Section for the Japanese

1779
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:39,000
home version, and in the arcade

1780
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:41,000
it was Ray Storm.

1781
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:43,000
Why couldn't they just pick one name?

1782
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:45,000
Because of licensing.

1783
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:47,000
It was fully licensing.

1784
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:49,000
Alright, well there you have it, your classic game of the week.

1785
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:51,000
Many, many different names

1786
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:53,000
for that one. Check it out on

1787
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:55,000
the Sega Saturn. Jamie loves

1788
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:57,000
her Sega games. Yes, she does.

1789
01:15:57,000 --> 01:15:59,000
I sure do. Alright.

1790
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:01,000
Well, that's going to do it for this part A of our podcast,

1791
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:03,000
but don't go anywhere. We're going to be right back

1792
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:05,000
with plenty more in part B. We have a lot

1793
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:07,000
coming up on deck in part B tonight. Not only do we

1794
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:09,000
have some news, some

1795
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:11,000
quick little stories here about what's coming out

1796
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:13,000
on Rock Band and Xbox Live, and

1797
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:15,000
some news on Star Trek Online,

1798
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:17,000
and Beatles Rock Band, and so forth.

1799
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:19,000
But we have an interview coming up. Our pal

1800
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:21,000
Seg is the man behind a charity

1801
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:23,000
event coming up in the Bay Area very soon

1802
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:25,000
known as Umlaud.

1803
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:27,000
And we're going to be talking to him about what's going to go down

1804
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:29,000
in December, just a few weeks away

1805
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:31,000
if you can believe it. The year's almost up.

1806
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:33,000
But it's all for a great cause. We're going to talk to Seg

1807
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:35,000
all about it right after this quick break.

1808
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:37,000
So don't go anywhere. We'll be right back with more

1809
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:39,000
of Orange Lounge Radio.

1810
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:09,000
It's allgamesradio.com. That's how I usually

1811
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:11,000
go in there. Or there's also a

1812
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:13,000
radio app that you can get on your iPhone if you just

1813
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:15,000
search for All Games in the store. They are the

1814
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:17,000
folks who we steal our bandwidth from every week.

1815
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:19,000
And we really, really appreciate

1816
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:21,000
it. So anyway, we're going to move into

1817
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:23,000
something a little different here. Usually we'll be doing

1818
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:25,000
Twitter topics about now, but we're actually going to invite

1819
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:27,000
a friend of the program on the show.

1820
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:29,000
And he goes by Seg online, but his name is

1821
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:31,000
John Segerson. He actually goes by the

1822
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:33,000
nickname Seg. And he is one of the minds behind

1823
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:35,000
Umlaud, which is a charity event that

1824
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:37,000
is happening in San Francisco at the DNA

1825
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:39,000
Lounge Wednesday, December 9th

1826
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:41,000
of this year, 7 p.m.

1827
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:43,000
to 2 a.m. It is a rock band

1828
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:45,000
event for Child's Play charity.

1829
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:47,000
And, you know, we like to talk about

1830
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:49,000
charity events and gamers doing

1831
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:51,000
good things. So we're going to give Seg a call

1832
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:53,000
and get him on the show to talk

1833
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:55,000
to us a little bit about Umlaud.

1834
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:57,000
So we're going to go ahead and

1835
01:17:57,000 --> 01:17:59,000
ring him up on Skype right now

1836
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:01,000
and see what happens.

1837
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:03,000
Hello, Orange Lounge Radio.

1838
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:05,000
Seg, how are you? I'm doing

1839
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:07,000
fabulous yourself. We're very good.

1840
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:09,000
Hey, thank you so much for being here live tonight.

1841
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:11,000
You know, a little secret of Orange Lounge Radio,

1842
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:13,000
most of our interviews are not done live, but

1843
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:15,000
you were good enough to actually be here live during the

1844
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:17,000
show tonight and be with us live.

1845
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:19,000
So thank you very much. No, no, no.

1846
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:21,000
Thank you for having us. You know,

1847
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:23,000
it's, we

1848
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:25,000
have a great event that we want to share with people

1849
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:27,000
and we want to make sure everyone knows about it.

1850
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:29,000
Alright, well tell us all about it. I'm going to start off

1851
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:31,000
what is Umlaud?

1852
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:33,000
It's an Umlaud,

1853
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:35,000
or Umlaud, but louder.

1854
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:37,000
It's a charity

1855
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:39,000
event for Child's Play

1856
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:41,000
charity, which provides

1857
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:43,000
video games, toys, and other financial support

1858
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:45,000
to children's hospitals around the globe.

1859
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:47,000
And our event

1860
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:49,000
is we play

1861
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:51,000
Rock Band as

1862
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:53,000
a catalyst for

1863
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:55,000
people donating money to Child's Play.

1864
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:57,000
But now, is

1865
01:18:57,000 --> 01:18:59,000
Rock Band the only thing that's going on at this event

1866
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:01,000
or is this kind of like just a big party where Rock Band's

1867
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:03,000
kind of in the corner? How does this work?

1868
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:05,000
Well, actually, this is going to be

1869
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:07,000
a very different

1870
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:09,000
kind of Rock Band night than

1871
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:11,000
most Rock Band

1872
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:13,000
nights. I mean, usually when people go out

1873
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:15,000
to do Rock Band

1874
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:17,000
at like a bar or something, you know, it's there, but it's

1875
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:19,000
you know, it's just everyone playing

1876
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:21,000
to a projector and all that.

1877
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:23,000
We're doing something a little bit

1878
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:25,000
more.

1879
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:27,000
We'll have one area

1880
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:29,000
of just regular Rock Band play,

1881
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:31,000
no fuss or anything, in the upstairs

1882
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:33,000
lounge area. But

1883
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:35,000
for the main event,

1884
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:37,000
you're playing Rock Band on

1885
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:39,000
the DNA lounge

1886
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:41,000
stage, a San Francisco concert

1887
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:43,000
venue. And you'll be performing

1888
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:45,000
Rock Band as a band

1889
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:47,000
on a concert stage to an audience.

1890
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:49,000
So it's more than just

1891
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:51,000
just playing Rock Band to the projector

1892
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:53,000
and all that. You're actually, you are

1893
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:55,000
putting on a

1894
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:57,000
rock concert

1895
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:59,000
for people. And

1896
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:01,000
depending on what kind of

1897
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:03,000
band package you donate to,

1898
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:05,000
you can really get the

1899
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:07,000
ultimate rock concert performance

1900
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:09,000
experience with the lighting, band

1901
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:11,000
introduction, the whole nine yards.

1902
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:13,000
Tell us a little more about some of these different experiences

1903
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:15,000
that, you know, Rock Band

1904
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:17,000
wannabes or however you want to phrase it,

1905
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:19,000
because you talk about how you can

1906
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:21,000
actually get up on a real stage that

1907
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:23,000
quote unquote real bands are performed

1908
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:25,000
up on. I mean, is that something that's

1909
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:27,000
accessible to everybody, or what are the different options

1910
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:29,000
for my band to showcase at this event?

1911
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:31,000
So, first of all,

1912
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:33,000
I do want to say that we do have two

1913
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:35,000
stages, and one stage is free for

1914
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:37,000
anybody to show up, and we'll get in a little

1915
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:39,000
later of

1916
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:41,000
what everybody can do.

1917
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:43,000
But if you and three of

1918
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:45,000
your friends really want

1919
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:47,000
to perform on the main stage,

1920
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:49,000
we have two

1921
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:51,000
packages to perform on the main stage.

1922
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:53,000
There's a standard band package,

1923
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:55,000
which we're going to

1924
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:57,000
ask for a $40 donation,

1925
01:20:57,000 --> 01:20:59,000
but if you order online, it's $35.

1926
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:01,000
And that's the whole band.

1927
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:03,000
So if you split that up to four people,

1928
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:05,000
that's $8.75

1929
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:07,000
a person.

1930
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:09,000
And for the standard band package, you get to

1931
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:11,000
play on the stage. You just

1932
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:13,000
play on the stage regularly, but you're still playing

1933
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:15,000
to the crowd on a major San Francisco

1934
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:17,000
stage. Now if you want to rock

1935
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:19,000
harder,

1936
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:21,000
that's where our ultimate band package comes in.

1937
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:23,000
If you want to put some extra oomph in your oomph

1938
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:25,000
loud. Exactly.

1939
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:27,000
And we're asking

1940
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:29,000
for $120

1941
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:31,000
for the donation, but again, that's the band

1942
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:33,000
package, so it amounts to $30. And you get

1943
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:35,000
a little bit,

1944
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:37,000
you get more into it

1945
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:39,000
with this package, where

1946
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:41,000
you first get to reserve

1947
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:43,000
your song ahead of time, and we are going to have

1948
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:45,000
a rule with just the main stage

1949
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:47,000
that once a song's

1950
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:49,000
played, it's not going to be played again.

1951
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:51,000
And we're doing that

1952
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:53,000
because we will have

1953
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:55,000
every

1954
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:57,000
song on rock band

1955
01:21:57,000 --> 01:21:59,000
available. Nice. We actually partnered

1956
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:01,000
up with Harmonix with this, and they will be

1957
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:03,000
providing

1958
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:05,000
stuff that can be played on rock

1959
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:07,000
band two, but all of it.

1960
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:09,000
So there's those few

1961
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:11,000
songs on rock band one

1962
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:13,000
that won't be included.

1963
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:15,000
And Beatles doesn't count for

1964
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:17,000
the main stage, because it's just hard to

1965
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:19,000
get people through without

1966
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:21,000
switching discs. Yeah, you don't want to have to switch discs all the time.

1967
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:23,000
That makes sense. Is it still like, what, a thousand songs

1968
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:25,000
to pick from? Yeah, it's about a thousand

1969
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:27,000
songs, you know. So

1970
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:29,000
we feel we're comfortable in doing this because

1971
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:31,000
it'd be pretty lame to have the same

1972
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:33,000
song played

1973
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:35,000
again. So if you're

1974
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:37,000
in the ultimate band package, you get to reserve it ahead of time.

1975
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:39,000
So that's

1976
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:41,000
one thing. You also

1977
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:43,000
get, each member of your band

1978
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:45,000
will get lanyards,

1979
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:47,000
you know, that sort of VIP pass

1980
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:49,000
thing.

1981
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:51,000
That's a nice little take-home memento. You also

1982
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:53,000
get, you'll get a gift bag for each

1983
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:55,000
band member,

1984
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:57,000
four bags.

1985
01:22:57,000 --> 01:22:59,000
And when you're about

1986
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:01,000
to go on stage, you'll be introduced as your

1987
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:03,000
band. You have to pick a name for your band, and we'll make

1988
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:05,000
an introduction for you.

1989
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:07,000
And we get

1990
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:09,000
the lighting guy involved, and it

1991
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:11,000
just really makes it

1992
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:13,000
the kind of experience you

1993
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:15,000
really can't

1994
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:17,000
get anywhere with it. Did you get the rock band

1995
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:19,000
Fog Machine? Who needs the

1996
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:21,000
Fog Machine? You'll have the full

1997
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:23,000
lighting setup of the

1998
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:25,000
DNA Lounges concert

1999
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:27,000
venue stage. I guess true enough.

2000
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:29,000
You get industrial strength.

2001
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:31,000
Yes, you get the industrial strength

2002
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:33,000
concert. Fair enough, fair enough.

2003
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:35,000
And for those folks that are thinking, oh my gosh,

2004
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:37,000
$120, that's a lot of money, keep in mind

2005
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:39,000
this is, you know, a

2006
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:41,000
once in a, you know, never

2007
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:43,000
type experience that you can get getting a play on the

2008
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:45,000
stage, and B, the fact that it's

2009
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:47,000
going to charity. I mean, it's not like going in

2010
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:49,000
Sake's pocket, it's going to a great charity.

2011
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:51,000
Yes, it's going to Child's Play.

2012
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:53,000
We really want to stress that this

2013
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:55,000
is a donation, and

2014
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:57,000
we are, the

2015
01:23:57,000 --> 01:23:59,000
money that you give is going to

2016
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:01,000
Child's Play.

2017
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:03,000
So it's, you know, I mean,

2018
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:05,000
if you stood back and just saw it as

2019
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:07,000
the value of just like, what would I pay

2020
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:09,000
just to play rock band? It's, you're

2021
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:11,000
kind of thinking it a little

2022
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:13,000
wrong in this context. This is

2023
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:15,000
a donation to which we are

2024
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:17,000
thanking you by giving you this experience.

2025
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:19,000
And plus it's just a chance to kind of get together

2026
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:21,000
with other nerds and have a good time. Yes, exactly.

2027
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:23,000
Now, here's the thing, is this because

2028
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:25,000
it's a rock concert, is it 18 up,

2029
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:27,000
21 and up, or? No, it is an all

2030
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:29,000
ages show at DNA Lounge.

2031
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:31,000
Yeah, we like to

2032
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:33,000
say it's T for teen and that, you know,

2033
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:35,000
we don't want people to think that

2034
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:37,000
because it's for Child's

2035
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:39,000
Play charity that it's for little kids.

2036
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:41,000
True. Just, you know, but it's

2037
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:43,000
an all ages show. Because if someone gets up

2038
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:45,000
on stage and doesn't censor the lyrics

2039
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:47,000
to a song that may have the F word in it, you

2040
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:49,000
don't want no one to get offended. Yeah.

2041
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:51,000
But it's all in good fun.

2042
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:53,000
But let me talk about, you know, I've been talking

2043
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:55,000
about the band packages, which is definitely the

2044
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:57,000
higher end stuff. Please do.

2045
01:24:57,000 --> 01:24:59,000
But I really,

2046
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:01,000
for people who don't, you know, don't

2047
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:03,000
want to perform and all that,

2048
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:05,000
it is a free

2049
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:07,000
event. We won't turn

2050
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:09,000
anyone away if they don't pay at the door.

2051
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:11,000
We are asking for a $10

2052
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:13,000
donation because

2053
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:15,000
this is a charity event.

2054
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:17,000
But no one will be turned

2055
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:19,000
away. And even if you don't

2056
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:21,000
do the donation, you will get two

2057
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:23,000
raffle tickets for our prize

2058
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:25,000
raffle. And our prize raffle

2059
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:27,000
is stuff that we've been

2060
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:29,000
that

2061
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:31,000
my co-words Chris

2062
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:33,000
Fuller, Joe Marquette, have been

2063
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:35,000
collecting throughout

2064
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:37,000
the year of all this swag and all this stuff

2065
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:39,000
and they've been piling up in their

2066
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:41,000
apartments. And we're going to

2067
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:43,000
give the stuff away as prizes

2068
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:45,000
in this free raffle.

2069
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:47,000
So there's a lot of incentive there.

2070
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:49,000
And actually Chris is doing

2071
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:51,000
a prize a day on our blog at

2072
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:53,000
umloud.org

2073
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:55,000
that's umloud.org

2074
01:25:55,000 --> 01:25:57,000
where he'll take a

2075
01:25:57,000 --> 01:25:59,000
photo of some of the things that he'll have

2076
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:01,000
and post it so you can see

2077
01:26:01,000 --> 01:26:03,000
the kinds of things that we'll be

2078
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:05,000
giving away on that night.

2079
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:07,000
Now I know this is an event

2080
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:09,000
that's being hosted at the DNA Lounge which is

2081
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:11,000
on 11th Street in San Francisco and again

2082
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:13,000
the date and time if you missed it, December 9th, 2009

2083
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:15,000
that's a Wednesday, 7 p.m.

2084
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:17,000
till 2 a.m. like most bars are open till

2085
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:19,000
2 a.m. But what if

2086
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:21,000
we have listeners all over the globe really?

2087
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:23,000
How can people help out if they can't

2088
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:25,000
be there in San Francisco on that night?

2089
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:27,000
Yes, I know

2090
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:29,000
our event is around San Francisco

2091
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:31,000
and all that, but if you can't make it to San Francisco

2092
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:33,000
or any of the other

2093
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:35,000
kinds of events that are

2094
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:37,000
happening, please

2095
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:39,000
consider a donation to

2096
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:41,000
Child's Play Charity.

2097
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:43,000
Just go directly to them.

2098
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:45,000
They're childsplaycharity.org

2099
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:47,000
and just consider

2100
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:49,000
a donation direct to them.

2101
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:51,000
We're doing this thing here in San Francisco

2102
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:53,000
because of the success of

2103
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:55,000
Fundrazer last year and a lot of

2104
01:26:55,000 --> 01:26:57,000
people liked it and it's the kind of thing that we know

2105
01:26:57,000 --> 01:26:59,000
that a lot of

2106
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:01,000
people come to and we want to

2107
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:03,000
facilitate that, but what we're really

2108
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:05,000
here is to show

2109
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:07,000
to create

2110
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:09,000
awareness to Child's Play Charity

2111
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:11,000
as a whole and this is

2112
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:13,000
one micro chasm of the

2113
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:15,000
many things going on in the gaming

2114
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:17,000
community to help Child's

2115
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:19,000
Play Charity. Well I think it's a

2116
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:21,000
great cause and it's a really fun event and you know

2117
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:23,000
if nothing else, even if people are like shy

2118
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:25,000
you know one thing that should be said is that

2119
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:27,000
this isn't just for people

2120
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:29,000
that love attention of getting up on stage and all

2121
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:31,000
that. If you just kind of want to come hang with

2122
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:33,000
cool people, come to this event

2123
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:35,000
because I'm going to be there and I believe

2124
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:37,000
Dark Soccer is going to be there and we're trying to

2125
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:39,000
get Loki there so hopefully we'll all be there

2126
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:41,000
so come hang with us. Yes and we'll definitely have

2127
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:43,000
more, I mean there's stuff that we're

2128
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:45,000
working on and I can't really put on, you know

2129
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:47,000
say right now, but don't feel

2130
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:49,000
that just because you didn't pay

2131
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:51,000
for, you know you didn't get the package

2132
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:53,000
the band package thing that there's nothing

2133
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:55,000
for you. There will be plenty

2134
01:27:55,000 --> 01:27:57,000
of things for you to do. You will have a good time

2135
01:27:57,000 --> 01:27:59,000
just showing up so please

2136
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:01,000
please come by

2137
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:03,000
we'd love to have you

2138
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:05,000
it's again for

2139
01:28:05,000 --> 01:28:07,000
all the information of this, there are many

2140
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:09,000
other things, please come to our website

2141
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:11,000
umloud.org

2142
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:13,000
that's u-m-l-o-u-d.org

2143
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:15,000
and we hope to see you there.

2144
01:28:15,000 --> 01:28:17,000
And I just wanted to mention this real quick

2145
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:19,000
I'm kind of glancing through chat here and I see Tiger

2146
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:21,000
Claw in chat says something about DNA

2147
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:23,000
Lounge seems to have like a live

2148
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:25,000
video stream? Oh yes

2149
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:27,000
that's right, yes there will be a live video stream

2150
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:29,000
that will be turned on

2151
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:31,000
during our events so

2152
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:33,000
you can also see us

2153
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:35,000
rock out, all the

2154
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:37,000
bands, it's

2155
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:39,000
going to be centered on the main stage

2156
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:41,000
I believe and you

2157
01:28:41,000 --> 01:28:43,000
can view it from anywhere

2158
01:28:43,000 --> 01:28:45,000
during the night as well. Oh well now we

2159
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:47,000
have to figure out a way to get up on that main stage

2160
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:49,000
so that the listeners around can see

2161
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:51,000
it so we're going to have to try and get Loki there

2162
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:53,000
if he can't make it we'll get some of our friends to come

2163
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:55,000
so we can get our president cat

2164
01:28:55,000 --> 01:28:57,000
band up on stage

2165
01:28:57,000 --> 01:28:59,000
and do order soon because we only have

2166
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:01,000
a limited amount of the band packages

2167
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:03,000
so we really

2168
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:05,000
if you really want to do

2169
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:07,000
it, get on the boat soon

2170
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:09,000
to do the band packages

2171
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:11,000
we'll have a few of the standard on hand

2172
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:13,000
but that's sort of our release valve

2173
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:15,000
to make sure that everyone who's

2174
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:17,000
paid for a package gets to play on the stage

2175
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:19,000
and we're also increasing the price

2176
01:29:19,000 --> 01:29:21,000
a little more

2177
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:23,000
on the night of for the standard band package

2178
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:25,000
so if you really want to do that

2179
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:27,000
if you think, if you

2180
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:29,000
really

2181
01:29:29,000 --> 01:29:31,000
want to do this, please order

2182
01:29:31,000 --> 01:29:33,000
soon than later

2183
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:35,000
Alright, so once again this is

2184
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:37,000

01:30:43,000 --> 01:30:45,000
Get the word out about

2219
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:47,000
Um Loud and a great event for

2220
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:49,000
Child's Play Charity

2221
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:51,000
Alright, Seg, thank you so much

2222
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:53,000
Thank you, take care

2223
01:30:53,000 --> 01:30:55,000
That was our friend John

2224
01:30:55,000 --> 01:30:57,000
Segerson who goes by the

2225
01:30:57,000 --> 01:30:59,000
Monkier Seg online

2226
01:30:59,000 --> 01:31:01,000
putting on Um Loud

2227
01:31:01,000 --> 01:31:03,000
Sounds like a lot of fun, Jamie, I don't know about you

2228
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:05,000
but I'm ready to turn it to 11 at this event

2229
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:07,000
Let's go

2230
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:09,000
We need to get mullet wigs

2231
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:11,000
I'm all for dressing up

2232
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:13,000
We need the rock mullet

2233
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:15,000
Come on, buddy

2234
01:31:15,000 --> 01:31:17,000
We'll see if I can make it down there

2235
01:31:17,000 --> 01:31:19,000
Alright, alright, at least we got upgraded from

2236
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:21,000
an I don't know to a we'll see

2237
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:23,000
so that's usually good

2238
01:31:23,000 --> 01:31:25,000
Anyhow, we'll get to more Skype calls a little later on in the show

2239
01:31:25,000 --> 01:31:27,000
I want to thank our buddy Seg for tuning in live

2240
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:29,000
and being here with us live

2241
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:31,000
We've got plenty more show for you

2242
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:33,000
including some rapid fire news and I believe

2243
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:35,000
right into a story about rock band

2244
01:31:35,000 --> 01:31:37,000
some more songs you can play at this event

2245
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:39,000
Exactly, some more songs you may be able to play

2246
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:41,000
during the event

2247
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:43,000
This week we're getting new tracks from Rob Zombie

2248
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:45,000
and Wolf Mother

2249
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:47,000
among other things

2250
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:49,000
They've got a whole variety pack here

2251
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:51,000
Looks like some morning wood tracks as well

2252
01:31:51,000 --> 01:31:53,000
Anyways, starting things off

2253
01:31:53,000 --> 01:31:55,000
Rob Zombie pack 1

2254
01:31:55,000 --> 01:31:57,000
which I got to say has got some sweet

2255
01:31:57,000 --> 01:31:59,000
songs in it, definitely something I'm going to be

2256
01:31:59,000 --> 01:32:01,000
purchasing

2257
01:32:01,000 --> 01:32:03,000
including Burn, Dragula, and Superbeast

2258
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:05,000
It's about freaking time Dragula's in the game

2259
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:07,000
Hell yes

2260
01:32:07,000 --> 01:32:09,000
What song are we going to sing?

2261
01:32:09,000 --> 01:32:11,000
That would be a perfect song

2262
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:13,000
You want to do Dragula?

2263
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:15,000
I can get up on there and do my best Rob Zombie

2264
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:17,000
I'll have to get a big curly wig or something

2265
01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:19,000
We'll figure something out

2266
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:21,000
Anyways, the Wolf Mother pack 1

2267
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:23,000
is going to have five tracks

2268
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:25,000
and that will include

2269
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:27,000
New Moon Rising, Pilgrim, Sundial,

2270
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:29,000
White Unicorn, and Woman

2271
01:32:29,000 --> 01:32:31,000
Finally, they have a few individual songs

2272
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:33,000
including

2273
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:35,000
Liz Fair, Rock Me, Morning Wood Best of Me

2274
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:37,000
and Morning Wood

2275
01:32:37,000 --> 01:32:39,000
Sugar Baby

2276
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:41,000
and each of those are available

2277
01:32:41,000 --> 01:32:43,000
Actually, the Morning Wood tracks are half off

2278
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:45,000
so it's only a buck

2279
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:47,000
or 80 Microsoft points

2280
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:49,000
Everything else individually is

2281
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:51,000
$1.99 or 200

2282
01:32:51,000 --> 01:32:53,000
Wii points or

2283
01:32:53,000 --> 01:32:55,000
160 Microsoft points

2284
01:32:55,000 --> 01:32:57,000
and of course the packs are a little bit cheaper

2285
01:32:57,000 --> 01:32:59,000
The Rob Zombie pack is $549

2286
01:32:59,000 --> 01:33:01,000
or 440 Microsoft points

2287
01:33:01,000 --> 01:33:03,000
680

2288
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:05,000
Microsoft points for the Wolf Mother pack

2289
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:07,000
or $849 in real money

2290
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:09,000
and then of course the

2291
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:11,000
PSP, they're getting

2292
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:13,000
Sonic Youth, Cool Thing

2293
01:33:13,000 --> 01:33:15,000
and Stealing and My Old School

2294
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:17,000
both of those for two bucks

2295
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:19,000
and then they go along

2296
01:33:19,000 --> 01:33:21,000
with releases

2297
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:23,000
Konami has confirmed that

2298
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:25,000
they're going to be releasing a

2299
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:27,000
port of Shadow of Destiny

2300
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:29,000
which came out I believe on PlayStation 2

2301
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:31,000
not too long ago

2302
01:33:31,000 --> 01:33:33,000
and

2303
01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:35,000
yeah

2304
01:33:35,000 --> 01:33:37,000
I guess it's nice to see them actually

2305
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:39,000
putting out some new games and stuff

2306
01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:41,000
and the game is

2307
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:43,000
I guess

2308
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:45,000
comparing it to Groundhog Day

2309
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:47,000
but I guess to the point where

2310
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:49,000
the person dies

2311
01:33:49,000 --> 01:33:51,000
over and over and over again

2312
01:33:51,000 --> 01:33:53,000
I don't know, I remember it being a pretty decent game

2313
01:33:53,000 --> 01:33:55,000
when it came out on PlayStation 2

2314
01:33:55,000 --> 01:33:57,000
Alright, well speaking of release dates

2315
01:33:57,000 --> 01:33:59,000
it's not very often we're talking about a game coming out early

2316
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:01,000
in fact this year it's been talking about all these games

2317
01:34:01,000 --> 01:34:03,000
getting delayed to 2010

2318
01:34:03,000 --> 01:34:05,000
but Need for Speed Nitro

2319
01:34:05,000 --> 01:34:07,000
that's the new Need for Speed entry on the Nintendo Wii and DS

2320
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:09,000
has had its release bumped up

2321
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:11,000
it was originally going to come out November 17th

2322
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:13,000
but guess what, it's now coming out

2323
01:34:13,000 --> 01:34:15,000
November 3rd here in the US

2324
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:17,000
and November 6th over in Europe

2325
01:34:17,000 --> 01:34:19,000
so it actually got out a little early

2326
01:34:19,000 --> 01:34:21,000
I actually checked this out at E3

2327
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:23,000
it was pretty cool for a Wii game

2328
01:34:23,000 --> 01:34:25,000
I know that sounds kind of harsh

2329
01:34:25,000 --> 01:34:27,000
but usually when you think Need for Speed and racing games

2330
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:29,000
you think, oh the top of the line graphics

2331
01:34:29,000 --> 01:34:31,000
you're not going to get that on the Wii

2332
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:33,000
but it was a good arcade game

2333
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:35,000
for arcade silly fun

2334
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:37,000
it was pretty cool

2335
01:34:37,000 --> 01:34:39,000
it didn't really feel like other Need for Speed games to me

2336
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:41,000
but maybe that's just me

2337
01:34:41,000 --> 01:34:43,000
on Xbox Live, Rainbow Islands

2338
01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:45,000
Towering Adventure is coming out on Xbox Live

2339
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:47,000
yes, that would be Rainbow Islands

2340
01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:49,000
that game that was once inspired

2341
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:51,000
by Bubble Bobble

2342
01:34:51,000 --> 01:34:53,000
it was kind of like a sequel to Bubble Bobble

2343
01:34:53,000 --> 01:34:55,000
it was a little different, it was still Bub and Bob

2344
01:34:55,000 --> 01:34:57,000
but they were shooting rainbows

2345
01:34:57,000 --> 01:34:59,000
although I noticed in the screenshots for this game

2346
01:34:59,000 --> 01:35:01,000
I don't see Bub and Bob

2347
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:03,000
it's like a new little guy here

2348
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:05,000
so this is some new little spinoff game

2349
01:35:05,000 --> 01:35:07,000
it's Rainbow Islands Towering Adventure

2350
01:35:07,000 --> 01:35:09,000
it is actually a port of a WiiWare game

2351
01:35:09,000 --> 01:35:11,000
that came out a little while ago

2352
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:13,000
so it's coming out very, very soon

2353
01:35:13,000 --> 01:35:15,000
also for those who are in Europe

2354
01:35:15,000 --> 01:35:17,000
and can make it and are interested

2355
01:35:17,000 --> 01:35:19,000
there's some playable Star Trek Online

2356
01:35:19,000 --> 01:35:21,000
at Eurogamer Expo

2357
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:23,000
they're almost out of tickets too

2358
01:35:23,000 --> 01:35:25,000
but that's on Wednesday the 28th

2359
01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:27,000
in Leeds

2360
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:29,000
and yeah, they're almost sold out

2361
01:35:29,000 --> 01:35:31,000
but you can actually

2362
01:35:31,000 --> 01:35:35,000
play on one of the gaming PCs there

2363
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:37,000
and

2364
01:35:37,000 --> 01:35:41,000
it's different level demos

2365
01:35:41,000 --> 01:35:43,000
you can do ship to ship and planet combat

2366
01:35:43,000 --> 01:35:45,000
and you can

2367
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:47,000
shoot Klingons in space

2368
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:49,000
and you can actually

2369
01:35:49,000 --> 01:35:51,000
I think play as Klingons

2370
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:53,000
in that one too

2371
01:35:53,000 --> 01:35:55,000
and also you can go visit

2372
01:35:55,000 --> 01:35:57,000
the giant lopsided donut

2373
01:35:57,000 --> 01:35:59,000
I mean the Guardian of Forever

2374
01:35:59,000 --> 01:36:01,000
so, should be fun

2375
01:36:03,000 --> 01:36:05,000
and

2376
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:07,000
Bayonetta

2377
01:36:07,000 --> 01:36:09,000
Bayonetta has done something major

2378
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:11,000
it is the first Xbox 360 game

2379
01:36:11,000 --> 01:36:13,000
that got a perfect score from Famitsu

2380
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:15,000
it got a perfect 40-40

2381
01:36:15,000 --> 01:36:17,000
although now Bayonetta is cross platform

2382
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:19,000
it just happens that Xbox 360

2383
01:36:19,000 --> 01:36:21,000
is one of the platforms it's on, correct?

2384
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:23,000
and also the better version

2385
01:36:23,000 --> 01:36:25,000
yeah, the other one got 38

2386
01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:27,000
oh, so they did review both

2387
01:36:27,000 --> 01:36:29,000
I didn't know that Famitsu did that

2388
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:31,000
very interesting

2389
01:36:31,000 --> 01:36:33,000
well, there are, if you actually

2390
01:36:33,000 --> 01:36:35,000
look for movies on YouTube

2391
01:36:35,000 --> 01:36:37,000
of them side by side

2392
01:36:37,000 --> 01:36:39,000
you will see a noticeable difference

2393
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:41,000
interesting, now Famitsu magazine

2394
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:43,000
doesn't hand out 40s very often

2395
01:36:43,000 --> 01:36:45,000
although it seems like we've had a few of these stories

2396
01:36:45,000 --> 01:36:47,000
in the past few years

2397
01:36:47,000 --> 01:36:49,000
sometimes you kind of raise an eyebrow at the games they give 40s to

2398
01:36:49,000 --> 01:36:51,000
like, I believe Nintendogs was one of their 40 titles

2399
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:53,000
but, you know, there's a lot of

2400
01:36:53,000 --> 01:36:55,000
really, really great games in the past

2401
01:36:55,000 --> 01:36:57,000
like Final Fantasy XII and so forth that got this as well

2402
01:36:57,000 --> 01:36:59,000
so it definitely is a distinction, I think only what a dozen games

2403
01:36:59,000 --> 01:37:01,000
in the history of the magazine have had it

2404
01:37:01,000 --> 01:37:03,000
I think so, Famitsu is really tough

2405
01:37:03,000 --> 01:37:05,000
so Bayonetta, getting that is a big, like, whoa

2406
01:37:05,000 --> 01:37:07,000
whoa, hello

2407
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:09,000
well, I'm totally getting Bayonetta

2408
01:37:09,000 --> 01:37:11,000
at the game, or just

2409
01:37:11,000 --> 01:37:13,000
we're only hearing about the 40s right now

2410
01:37:13,000 --> 01:37:15,000
I think it's just the 40s so far

2411
01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:17,000
let me double check

2412
01:37:17,000 --> 01:37:19,000
Salacious Pop clarifies, by the way

2413
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:21,000
they gave the PS3 version of 38 because the port

2414
01:37:21,000 --> 01:37:23,000
is muddy and bad, it looks brown

2415
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:25,000
and is missing quite a bit of particles

2416
01:37:25,000 --> 01:37:27,000
ouch

2417
01:37:27,000 --> 01:37:29,000
yeah, they're not really saying why

2418
01:37:29,000 --> 01:37:31,000
but yeah, just seriously, look at them side by side

2419
01:37:31,000 --> 01:37:33,000
38's still not bad

2420
01:37:33,000 --> 01:37:35,000
that's why it's intense, it's like, oh, it's crappy

2421
01:37:35,000 --> 01:37:37,000
I think President Cat

2422
01:37:37,000 --> 01:37:39,000
got, what, like a 24

2423
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:41,000
from Famitsu, but they're kind of

2424
01:37:41,000 --> 01:37:43,000
yeah, they're used to seeing these games a lot

2425
01:37:43,000 --> 01:37:45,000
too, I think it's a lot different for them

2426
01:37:45,000 --> 01:37:47,000
than it was for us, maybe like a generic party game

2427
01:37:47,000 --> 01:37:49,000
coming out over here on the Wii, I mean

2428
01:37:49,000 --> 01:37:51,000
those are, you know, a dime a dozen

2429
01:37:51,000 --> 01:37:53,000
whereas Cat Games, there's two

2430
01:37:53,000 --> 01:37:55,000
maybe a little bit more, but

2431
01:37:55,000 --> 01:37:57,000
about a handful

2432
01:37:57,000 --> 01:37:59,000
alright, moving on to

2433
01:37:59,000 --> 01:38:01,000
some more gaming news

2434
01:38:01,000 --> 01:38:03,000
and your phone calls a little later on tonight

2435
01:38:03,000 --> 01:38:05,000
in the mailbag, we still have that to get to

2436
01:38:05,000 --> 01:38:07,000
controller patent, this controller

2437
01:38:07,000 --> 01:38:09,000
looks odd

2438
01:38:09,000 --> 01:38:11,000
and, well, I guess it's

2439
01:38:11,000 --> 01:38:13,000
normal for them, since they have the Cosmic Ice Cream

2440
01:38:13,000 --> 01:38:15,000
cone, but this controller

2441
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:17,000
looks like, it's like a cylinder with

2442
01:38:17,000 --> 01:38:19,000
the end cut off and four buttons on it

2443
01:38:19,000 --> 01:38:21,000
no word on what

2444
01:38:21,000 --> 01:38:23,000
the hell this is going to be used for, possibly

2445
01:38:23,000 --> 01:38:25,000
designed for their new remote

2446
01:38:25,000 --> 01:38:27,000
their motion controller device

2447
01:38:27,000 --> 01:38:29,000
sans

2448
01:38:29,000 --> 01:38:31,000
ice cream, I guess

2449
01:38:31,000 --> 01:38:33,000
but

2450
01:38:33,000 --> 01:38:35,000
this world looks like a sex toy

2451
01:38:35,000 --> 01:38:37,000
too, so, I don't know

2452
01:38:39,000 --> 01:38:41,000
uh, that sounds kinda gross

2453
01:38:41,000 --> 01:38:43,000
yeah

2454
01:38:43,000 --> 01:38:45,000
hmm

2455
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:47,000
but, uh, so this is not like

2456
01:38:47,000 --> 01:38:49,000
these are actually coming

2457
01:38:49,000 --> 01:38:51,000
out, this is just a list of

2458
01:38:51,000 --> 01:38:53,000
this is what could have been, or what is this

2459
01:38:53,000 --> 01:38:55,000
it's a design, they may go with it

2460
01:38:55,000 --> 01:38:57,000
they may not go with it, it's just like, you know

2461
01:38:57,000 --> 01:38:59,000
Nintendo with their inflatable chair of

2462
01:38:59,000 --> 01:39:01,000
fun, you know, it might come out

2463
01:39:01,000 --> 01:39:03,000
it might not, it's just an idea

2464
01:39:03,000 --> 01:39:05,000
I thought everything was sold on the whole, like, lights thing

2465
01:39:05,000 --> 01:39:07,000
or the changing light dot

2466
01:39:07,000 --> 01:39:09,000
beam looking thing, now

2467
01:39:09,000 --> 01:39:11,000
I thought that's what we were going at

2468
01:39:11,000 --> 01:39:13,000
well, maybe they decided to change

2469
01:39:13,000 --> 01:39:15,000
the way they look, maybe the

2470
01:39:15,000 --> 01:39:17,000
maybe there's a light on here

2471
01:39:17,000 --> 01:39:19,000
that we don't see or something, I don't know

2472
01:39:19,000 --> 01:39:21,000
to me it looks like a plastic cylinder that

2473
01:39:21,000 --> 01:39:23,000
has four buttons on top

2474
01:39:23,000 --> 01:39:25,000
well, you know what though

2475
01:39:25,000 --> 01:39:27,000
I don't, I don't

2476
01:39:27,000 --> 01:39:29,000
I have a lot of faith in Sony when it comes to

2477
01:39:29,000 --> 01:39:31,000
controller design, because I still love

2478
01:39:31,000 --> 01:39:33,000
the PlayStation controllers, although then again

2479
01:39:33,000 --> 01:39:35,000
I say that and then at the same time I think

2480
01:39:35,000 --> 01:39:37,000
yeah, but then they did take DualShock out of the PS3

2481
01:39:37,000 --> 01:39:39,000
but that was a whole different reason, that wasn't really a design

2482
01:39:39,000 --> 01:39:41,000
well it's because they didn't want to pay royalties

2483
01:39:41,000 --> 01:39:43,000
but, you know, the

2484
01:39:43,000 --> 01:39:45,000
PlayStation 3 controller is still a rock solid

2485
01:39:45,000 --> 01:39:47,000
controller, especially, you know, and I

2486
01:39:47,000 --> 01:39:49,000
took some crap last week for saying this, but

2487
01:39:49,000 --> 01:39:51,000
especially compared to the 360 controller, which

2488
01:39:51,000 --> 01:39:53,000
you know, the D-pad leaves a lot

2489
01:39:53,000 --> 01:39:55,000
to be desired on the 360 controller

2490
01:39:55,000 --> 01:39:57,000
the PS3 is a pretty slick controller

2491
01:39:57,000 --> 01:39:59,000
especially the newer ones, so you know

2492
01:39:59,000 --> 01:40:01,000
I kind of trust their judgement when it comes to

2493
01:40:01,000 --> 01:40:03,000
making controllers, they usually don't make bad ones

2494
01:40:03,000 --> 01:40:05,000
except that boomerang thing was really weird

2495
01:40:05,000 --> 01:40:07,000
but that never did come out

2496
01:40:07,000 --> 01:40:09,000
that was only a concept thing, so

2497
01:40:09,000 --> 01:40:11,000
maybe that light thing went the way of the boomerang

2498
01:40:11,000 --> 01:40:13,000
but thankfully we do live in the day

2499
01:40:13,000 --> 01:40:15,000
and the age of the internet

2500
01:40:15,000 --> 01:40:17,000
because if this was like, you know

2501
01:40:17,000 --> 01:40:19,000
the mid 90s where all we had were gaming magazines

2502
01:40:19,000 --> 01:40:21,000
that boomerang would have come out

2503
01:40:21,000 --> 01:40:23,000
possibly, because they wouldn't have heard

2504
01:40:23,000 --> 01:40:25,000
the horrible feedback

2505
01:40:25,000 --> 01:40:27,000
I don't think, I don't know

2506
01:40:27,000 --> 01:40:29,000
this is like a debate that's years old at this point

2507
01:40:29,000 --> 01:40:31,000
but I don't know if the boomerang was necessarily a bad

2508
01:40:31,000 --> 01:40:33,000
thing, I'd have to feel it in my hands

2509
01:40:33,000 --> 01:40:35,000
if it felt fine to control with

2510
01:40:35,000 --> 01:40:37,000
I would have been okay with the weird design

2511
01:40:37,000 --> 01:40:39,000
but I just think at the same time

2512
01:40:39,000 --> 01:40:41,000
the PlayStation controller is like one of the

2513
01:40:41,000 --> 01:40:43,000
best controllers ever, why ruin

2514
01:40:43,000 --> 01:40:45,000
a good thing? You know, look at the PS1

2515
01:40:45,000 --> 01:40:47,000
PS2, PS3 controllers, they've all

2516
01:40:47,000 --> 01:40:49,000
been pretty much the same, and there's a reason for that

2517
01:40:49,000 --> 01:40:51,000
you know, granted they added

2518
01:40:51,000 --> 01:40:53,000
rumble to it at some point along the way

2519
01:40:53,000 --> 01:40:55,000
they added dual, you know, and all that

2520
01:40:55,000 --> 01:40:57,000
pretty much though it stayed consistent

2521
01:40:59,000 --> 01:41:01,000
alright, moving on to another

2522
01:41:01,000 --> 01:41:03,000
news story having to do with Beatles Rock Band

2523
01:41:03,000 --> 01:41:05,000
Beatles Rock Band

2524
01:41:05,000 --> 01:41:07,000
has actually beaten Guitar Hero 5

2525
01:41:07,000 --> 01:41:09,000
on the sales chart

2526
01:41:09,000 --> 01:41:11,000
this is based on US September

2527
01:41:11,000 --> 01:41:13,000
sales, yeah, believe it or not

2528
01:41:13,000 --> 01:41:15,000
the Beatles

2529
01:41:15,000 --> 01:41:17,000
was released September 9th and Guitar Hero 5

2530
01:41:17,000 --> 01:41:19,000
was released September 1st, the Beatles has moved

2531
01:41:19,000 --> 01:41:21,000
595,000

2532
01:41:21,000 --> 01:41:23,000
units to 499

2533
01:41:23,000 --> 01:41:25,000
units of Guitar Hero 5

2534
01:41:25,000 --> 01:41:27,000
granted that's really close

2535
01:41:27,000 --> 01:41:29,000
but also it should be noted that

2536
01:41:29,000 --> 01:41:31,000
the All You Need Is Love download track

2537
01:41:31,000 --> 01:41:33,000
100,000 downloads

2538
01:41:33,000 --> 01:41:35,000
in September, so this is only

2539
01:41:35,000 --> 01:41:37,000
considering September, it's not considering the

2540
01:41:37,000 --> 01:41:39,000
important Christmas period, I don't want to start

2541
01:41:39,000 --> 01:41:41,000
all this like OMG Guitar Hero 5

2542
01:41:41,000 --> 01:41:43,000
but it is a little surprising

2543
01:41:43,000 --> 01:41:45,000
considering Beatles

2544
01:41:45,000 --> 01:41:47,000
Rock Band to some was kind of a niche title

2545
01:41:47,000 --> 01:41:49,000
I don't think it is

2546
01:41:49,000 --> 01:41:51,000
surprising to me because they went all out

2547
01:41:51,000 --> 01:41:53,000
with Guitar Hero 5 as far as trying to get people

2548
01:41:53,000 --> 01:41:55,000
to buy it, I mean they were throwing in a free game

2549
01:41:55,000 --> 01:41:57,000
even, you know, to really push that first

2550
01:41:57,000 --> 01:41:59,000
month numbers and it failed

2551
01:41:59,000 --> 01:42:01,000
is this a sign that people are

2552
01:42:01,000 --> 01:42:03,000
kind of wising up to the 50,000

2553
01:42:03,000 --> 01:42:05,000
releases in a year?

2554
01:42:05,000 --> 01:42:07,000
I don't know, it'll be

2555
01:42:07,000 --> 01:42:09,000
interesting to see what's going to happen

2556
01:42:09,000 --> 01:42:11,000
I'm not remotely surprised, I'm surprised it didn't sell more

2557
01:42:11,000 --> 01:42:13,000
a lot of people are actually surprised

2558
01:42:13,000 --> 01:42:15,000
the Beatles game didn't sell more, but of course

2559
01:42:15,000 --> 01:42:17,000
you know, this game will move throughout

2560
01:42:17,000 --> 01:42:19,000
Christmas, I mean both of these games

2561
01:42:19,000 --> 01:42:21,000
are still going to continue to move, but it is a very

2562
01:42:21,000 --> 01:42:23,000
I mean, doesn't Guitar Hero, I mean, just taking

2563
01:42:23,000 --> 01:42:25,000
the whole Beatles thing out of it, doesn't

2564
01:42:25,000 --> 01:42:27,000
Guitar Hero usually tend to beat Rock Band

2565
01:42:27,000 --> 01:42:29,000
on sales chart? Well

2566
01:42:29,000 --> 01:42:31,000
it depends who you're asking because

2567
01:42:31,000 --> 01:42:33,000
they

2568
01:42:33,000 --> 01:42:35,000
say, yeah, we've sold more units, well yeah

2569
01:42:35,000 --> 01:42:37,000
you have like five times as many

2570
01:42:37,000 --> 01:42:39,000
games coming out, so yes, you've sold

2571
01:42:39,000 --> 01:42:41,000
more units, I see, but

2572
01:42:41,000 --> 01:42:43,000
so you can't really

2573
01:42:43,000 --> 01:42:45,000
trust those numbers

2574
01:42:45,000 --> 01:42:47,000
I mean, look at, you know, even the Guitar Hero

2575
01:42:47,000 --> 01:42:49,000
platform, you've still got two more games coming out

2576
01:42:49,000 --> 01:42:51,000
this year in Guitar

2577
01:42:51,000 --> 01:42:53,000
well, Band Hero, but come on

2578
01:42:53,000 --> 01:42:55,000
it's Guitar Hero, it's just E10, you know

2579
01:42:55,000 --> 01:42:57,000
and then Van Halen

2580
01:42:57,000 --> 01:42:59,000
you know, that's still coming out too, so

2581
01:42:59,000 --> 01:43:01,000
it's a little

2582
01:43:01,000 --> 01:43:03,000
oversaturation right now

2583
01:43:03,000 --> 01:43:05,000
Hmm, interesting

2584
01:43:05,000 --> 01:43:07,000
comment from xlink in chatroom on a

2585
01:43:07,000 --> 01:43:09,000
related topic, says, I do

2586
01:43:09,000 --> 01:43:11,000
if you look at the box office

2587
01:43:11,000 --> 01:43:13,000
Saw VI got the

2588
01:43:13,000 --> 01:43:15,000
number two spot

2589
01:43:15,000 --> 01:43:17,000
too much can be an overkill, and that's a good

2590
01:43:17,000 --> 01:43:19,000
point is that, you know, maybe the saturation

2591
01:43:19,000 --> 01:43:21,000
of Guitar Hero is starting to catch up to him

2592
01:43:21,000 --> 01:43:23,000
because, you know, I think

2593
01:43:23,000 --> 01:43:25,000
a lot of us, at least me, I never like the

2594
01:43:25,000 --> 01:43:27,000
Saw movies really to begin with, but I especially look at

2595
01:43:27,000 --> 01:43:29,000
Saw VI and go, enough already!

2596
01:43:29,000 --> 01:43:31,000
It was actually pretty good

2597
01:43:31,000 --> 01:43:33,000
Did you go see it? Yeah! Really?

2598
01:43:33,000 --> 01:43:35,000
I didn't like

2599
01:43:35,000 --> 01:43:37,000
the last few because it's just hard to follow what's going on

2600
01:43:37,000 --> 01:43:39,000
but this one actually took place after the last movie

2601
01:43:39,000 --> 01:43:41,000
you know, Chronology, which

2602
01:43:41,000 --> 01:43:43,000
is awesome, and it kind of explained a lot of things

2603
01:43:43,000 --> 01:43:45,000
and I thought it was actually pretty decent

2604
01:43:45,000 --> 01:43:47,000
Hmm, but it got, do you know

2605
01:43:47,000 --> 01:43:49,000
what it got beat by? Did it explain why people like it?

2606
01:43:49,000 --> 01:43:51,000
Where the Wild Things Are, I'm guessing

2607
01:43:51,000 --> 01:43:53,000
No, it got beat by a little indie title

2608
01:43:53,000 --> 01:43:55,000
that has made it big called Paranormal Activity

2609
01:43:55,000 --> 01:43:57,000
I want to see that

2610
01:43:57,000 --> 01:43:59,000
Was the number one movie

2611
01:43:59,000 --> 01:44:01,000
I actually get to see that for free pretty soon

2612
01:44:01,000 --> 01:44:03,000
We're having a screening

2613
01:44:03,000 --> 01:44:05,000
Well that movie's made a lot of

2614
01:44:05,000 --> 01:44:07,000
buzz based off of the internet and Twitter

2615
01:44:07,000 --> 01:44:09,000
and the way, it's the very, it's Blair

2616
01:44:09,000 --> 01:44:11,000
You know, funny enough, we're ten years

2617
01:44:11,000 --> 01:44:13,000
believe it or not, after the Blair Witch Project

2618
01:44:13,000 --> 01:44:15,000
which is a very similar kind of marketing

2619
01:44:15,000 --> 01:44:17,000
although technology's changed in the past ten years

2620
01:44:17,000 --> 01:44:19,000
but Paranormal Activity is sort of

2621
01:44:19,000 --> 01:44:21,000
2009's Blair Witch Project in a way

2622
01:44:21,000 --> 01:44:23,000
They're marketing it like a Wii

2623
01:44:23,000 --> 01:44:25,000
Whereas, you know, we're not gonna put it out everywhere

2624
01:44:25,000 --> 01:44:27,000
and you're gonna hear how awesome this movie is

2625
01:44:27,000 --> 01:44:29,000
and you're gonna be like, I wish I could see it

2626
01:44:29,000 --> 01:44:31,000
but it's not in my town and then we're gonna

2627
01:44:31,000 --> 01:44:33,000
flood the market with it and then

2628
01:44:33,000 --> 01:44:35,000
everyone goes and sees it

2629
01:44:35,000 --> 01:44:37,000
So that's what they did this weekend

2630
01:44:37,000 --> 01:44:39,000
ActDeftInChat says, enough is enough

2631
01:44:39,000 --> 01:44:41,000
I've had it with these motherfucking

2632
01:44:41,000 --> 01:44:43,000
saws in my motherfucking movies

2633
01:44:43,000 --> 01:44:45,000
And that apparently

2634
01:44:45,000 --> 01:44:47,000
might be what some people are saying about Guitar Hero

2635
01:44:47,000 --> 01:44:49,000
I don't know, interestingly enough

2636
01:44:49,000 --> 01:44:51,000
I'm more interested in

2637
01:44:51,000 --> 01:44:53,000
Guitar Hero 5

2638
01:44:53,000 --> 01:44:55,000
than I have been in a Guitar Hero

2639
01:44:55,000 --> 01:44:57,000
game in a while, and I think Band Hero

2640
01:44:57,000 --> 01:44:59,000
was needed, you know what I mean

2641
01:44:59,000 --> 01:45:01,000
For that other audience

2642
01:45:01,000 --> 01:45:03,000
I kind of look at this and go

2643
01:45:03,000 --> 01:45:05,000
Activision

2644
01:45:05,000 --> 01:45:07,000
isn't doing anything wrong this year

2645
01:45:07,000 --> 01:45:09,000
except for the fact that maybe

2646
01:45:09,000 --> 01:45:11,000
they just put out too much

2647
01:45:11,000 --> 01:45:13,000
Really? Here's what comes out

2648
01:45:13,000 --> 01:45:15,000
Here's what comes down too

2649
01:45:15,000 --> 01:45:17,000
I don't think the Van Halen game was needed

2650
01:45:17,000 --> 01:45:19,000
I think in the Metallica game and all this other stuff

2651
01:45:19,000 --> 01:45:21,000
You don't need to buy them

2652
01:45:21,000 --> 01:45:23,000
But Guitar Hero fans do buy them

2653
01:45:23,000 --> 01:45:25,000
And the reason you keep putting them out

2654
01:45:25,000 --> 01:45:27,000
is because you keep buying them

2655
01:45:27,000 --> 01:45:29,000
I guess it's more of a sure thing

2656
01:45:29,000 --> 01:45:31,000
for them to put out a new

2657
01:45:31,000 --> 01:45:33,000
Guitar Hero game every once in a while

2658
01:45:33,000 --> 01:45:35,000
sell it for $60

2659
01:45:35,000 --> 01:45:37,000
and make that

2660
01:45:37,000 --> 01:45:39,000
kind of money back versus trying to

2661
01:45:39,000 --> 01:45:41,000
gamble on download content

2662
01:45:41,000 --> 01:45:43,000
which they do a little bit, but it's nowhere

2663
01:45:43,000 --> 01:45:45,000
near what Rock Band's doing

2664
01:45:45,000 --> 01:45:47,000
Quick question chat and then we'll get into the next story

2665
01:45:47,000 --> 01:45:49,000
XLink asks, speaking of SAW

2666
01:45:49,000 --> 01:45:51,000
basically, how many people have bought

2667
01:45:51,000 --> 01:45:53,000
SAW the video game? Any idea

2668
01:45:53,000 --> 01:45:55,000
Lowkey? How that game's moving?

2669
01:45:55,000 --> 01:45:57,000
The SAW video game?

2670
01:45:57,000 --> 01:45:59,000
I don't know, but I can

2671
01:45:59,000 --> 01:46:01,000
find out

2672
01:46:01,000 --> 01:46:03,000
That brings us to the next story

2673
01:46:03,000 --> 01:46:05,000
If we can move on there and then we'll

2674
01:46:05,000 --> 01:46:07,000
figure that out later

2675
01:46:07,000 --> 01:46:09,000
Well, for people who are playing Marvel Ultimate Alliance 2

2676
01:46:09,000 --> 01:46:11,000
there actually is a future

2677
01:46:11,000 --> 01:46:13,000
character coming up

2678
01:46:13,000 --> 01:46:15,000
for download

2679
01:46:15,000 --> 01:46:17,000
is Cable

2680
01:46:17,000 --> 01:46:19,000
Right now he's an NPC, but he will be

2681
01:46:19,000 --> 01:46:21,000
downloadable to be playable

2682
01:46:21,000 --> 01:46:23,000
I guess that's a pay to unlock type of thing

2683
01:46:23,000 --> 01:46:25,000
and

2684
01:46:25,000 --> 01:46:27,000
yeah, I hope he's

2685
01:46:27,000 --> 01:46:29,000
he's not, you know

2686
01:46:29,000 --> 01:46:31,000
overly imbalanced

2687
01:46:31,000 --> 01:46:33,000
but also

2688
01:46:33,000 --> 01:46:35,000
for more missions, there's a Psylocke mission

2689
01:46:35,000 --> 01:46:37,000
coming out too, which will be pretty cool

2690
01:46:41,000 --> 01:46:43,000
Have you played the Ultimate Alliance game yet?

2691
01:46:43,000 --> 01:46:45,000
The new one?

2692
01:46:45,000 --> 01:46:47,000
No, it's still sitting right here on my desk

2693
01:46:47,000 --> 01:46:49,000
Hopefully one day your hand will be all patched up

2694
01:46:49,000 --> 01:46:51,000
and you can

2695
01:46:51,000 --> 01:46:53,000
get into that, because I'm kind of curious

2696
01:46:53,000 --> 01:46:55,000
what the Marvel fans think of that one

2697
01:46:55,000 --> 01:46:57,000
Couple more stories. Oh, did you find the SAW video game?

2698
01:46:57,000 --> 01:46:59,000
Yes, I did. I'm just pulling up

2699
01:46:59,000 --> 01:47:01,000
PlayStation 3 numbers right now

2700
01:47:01,000 --> 01:47:03,000
For the Xbox 360

2701
01:47:03,000 --> 01:47:05,000
it sold

2702
01:47:05,000 --> 01:47:07,000
.03 million units

2703
01:47:07,000 --> 01:47:09,000
so that would be like

2704
01:47:09,000 --> 01:47:11,000
30,000 copies? Wow

2705
01:47:11,000 --> 01:47:13,000
Yeah

2706
01:47:13,000 --> 01:47:15,000
Yeah, 30,000 copies, granted

2707
01:47:15,000 --> 01:47:17,000
I mean, that's not great

2708
01:47:17,000 --> 01:47:19,000
it only came out a couple weeks ago

2709
01:47:19,000 --> 01:47:21,000
and this is only showing in the first two weeks

2710
01:47:21,000 --> 01:47:23,000
but

2711
01:47:23,000 --> 01:47:25,000
it has dropped in half versus

2712
01:47:25,000 --> 01:47:27,000
week one, week two. Maybe it'll bump up again

2713
01:47:27,000 --> 01:47:29,000
with the new movie out and everything

2714
01:47:29,000 --> 01:47:31,000
Halloween and all that

2715
01:47:31,000 --> 01:47:33,000
Maybe

2716
01:47:33,000 --> 01:47:35,000
PlayStation 3 version sold only

2717
01:47:35,000 --> 01:47:37,000
20,000 units, so 50,000 total

2718
01:47:37,000 --> 01:47:39,000
but once again

2719
01:47:39,000 --> 01:47:41,000
I bring up the point

2720
01:47:41,000 --> 01:47:43,000
these publishers are putting out games that are only selling

2721
01:47:43,000 --> 01:47:45,000
under 100,000 units or whatever

2722
01:47:45,000 --> 01:47:47,000
President Cat

2723
01:47:47,000 --> 01:47:49,000
could do quite well over here

2724
01:47:49,000 --> 01:47:51,000
I mean, if their expectations

2725
01:47:51,000 --> 01:47:53,000
are just to sell maybe a few 100,000

2726
01:47:53,000 --> 01:47:55,000
units, if that, or even

2727
01:47:55,000 --> 01:47:57,000
100,000 units

2728
01:47:57,000 --> 01:47:59,000
it's easy on the Wii

2729
01:47:59,000 --> 01:48:01,000
easy to do that

2730
01:48:01,000 --> 01:48:03,000
Out of curiosity, and I apologize because I know we don't have the answer

2731
01:48:03,000 --> 01:48:05,000
right in front of you, but how does this compare to Silent Hill

2732
01:48:05,000 --> 01:48:07,000
Homecoming? Because I know at one point they were talking

2733
01:48:07,000 --> 01:48:09,000
about Saw was supposed

2734
01:48:09,000 --> 01:48:11,000
to be like Konami's new series

2735
01:48:11,000 --> 01:48:13,000
that I guess

2736
01:48:13,000 --> 01:48:15,000
was going to co-exist with Silent Hill

2737
01:48:15,000 --> 01:48:17,000
but you kind of get the weird feeling, are they going to try and replace

2738
01:48:17,000 --> 01:48:19,000
Silent Hill with Saw? But

2739
01:48:19,000 --> 01:48:21,000
Silent Hill Homecoming kind of took a lot of crap

2740
01:48:21,000 --> 01:48:23,000
from the reviewers

2741
01:48:23,000 --> 01:48:25,000
and the fact

2742
01:48:25,000 --> 01:48:27,000
that they just outright cancelled the game

2743
01:48:27,000 --> 01:48:29,000
for Japan, which kind of says something

2744
01:48:29,000 --> 01:48:31,000
about their faith in the game as it is

2745
01:48:31,000 --> 01:48:33,000
I don't think the game was terrible by any means

2746
01:48:33,000 --> 01:48:35,000
you know, it's different from the other games, you could tell it was developed

2747
01:48:35,000 --> 01:48:37,000
somewhere else, but I don't think it was bad at all

2748
01:48:37,000 --> 01:48:39,000
Well, let's see, in comparison

2749
01:48:39,000 --> 01:48:41,000
for example, the

2750
01:48:41,000 --> 01:48:43,000
Xbox 360 version now

2751
01:48:43,000 --> 01:48:45,000
of Saw only sold 20,000

2752
01:48:45,000 --> 01:48:47,000
units in the first week

2753
01:48:47,000 --> 01:48:49,000
the Xbox 360 version of Silent Hill

2754
01:48:49,000 --> 01:48:51,000
sold 47,000

2755
01:48:51,000 --> 01:48:53,000
units in the first week

2756
01:48:53,000 --> 01:48:55,000
Okay, there you go

2757
01:48:55,000 --> 01:48:57,000
So, you know, about

2758
01:48:57,000 --> 01:48:59,000
almost 30,000 more units

2759
01:48:59,000 --> 01:49:01,000
and then continued to sell

2760
01:49:01,000 --> 01:49:03,000
and still continuing to sell

2761
01:49:03,000 --> 01:49:05,000
but, you know, once again

2762
01:49:05,000 --> 01:49:07,000
it's a little early to see, but

2763
01:49:07,000 --> 01:49:09,000
granted games normally don't peak back

2764
01:49:09,000 --> 01:49:11,000
up again, it's just normally either

2765
01:49:11,000 --> 01:49:13,000
consistent or it starts to

2766
01:49:13,000 --> 01:49:15,000
degrade and it didn't start

2767
01:49:15,000 --> 01:49:17,000
that high to begin with, so it may sell

2768
01:49:17,000 --> 01:49:19,000
I'm guessing probably in its lifetime

2769
01:49:19,000 --> 01:49:21,000
it will probably sell

2770
01:49:21,000 --> 01:49:23,000
maybe 100,000

2771
01:49:23,000 --> 01:49:25,000
units on the Xbox

2772
01:49:25,000 --> 01:49:27,000
360, probably combined

2773
01:49:27,000 --> 01:49:29,000
I'd say it's gonna sell maybe

2774
01:49:29,000 --> 01:49:31,000
150,000, both platforms

2775
01:49:31,000 --> 01:49:33,000
so

2776
01:49:33,000 --> 01:49:35,000
And you don't just pull these numbers out of your ass

2777
01:49:35,000 --> 01:49:37,000
I mean, you do a little bit, but

2778
01:49:37,000 --> 01:49:39,000
keep in mind, for those that may not have listened to the show before

2779
01:49:39,000 --> 01:49:41,000
Loki, you work in distribution, so

2780
01:49:41,000 --> 01:49:43,000
you have a pretty good thumbprint on, you know

2781
01:49:43,000 --> 01:49:45,000
who's ordering what

2782
01:49:45,000 --> 01:49:47,000
I'm still looking at, there's a website, VGCharts

2783
01:49:47,000 --> 01:49:49,000
that pulls stuff from NPD

2784
01:49:49,000 --> 01:49:51,000
numbers, so I'm looking at what the actual

2785
01:49:51,000 --> 01:49:53,000
numbers were each week

2786
01:49:53,000 --> 01:49:55,000
Silent Hill on PS3 sold

2787
01:49:55,000 --> 01:49:57,000
41,000 units in the first week

2788
01:49:57,000 --> 01:49:59,000
versus the 20 that sold

2789
01:49:59,000 --> 01:50:01,000
you know

2790
01:50:01,000 --> 01:50:03,000
not even 20, you know

2791
01:50:03,000 --> 01:50:05,000
probably like 15

2792
01:50:05,000 --> 01:50:07,000
for Saw, so

2793
01:50:07,000 --> 01:50:09,000
Complete random ass question I'm gonna put out there

2794
01:50:09,000 --> 01:50:11,000
and maybe you don't even know the answer to this, but

2795
01:50:11,000 --> 01:50:13,000
is there any highly anticipated

2796
01:50:13,000 --> 01:50:15,000
game coming out this season

2797
01:50:15,000 --> 01:50:17,000
that you're just noticing is not

2798
01:50:17,000 --> 01:50:19,000
selling? That you're just not selling

2799
01:50:19,000 --> 01:50:21,000
copies of it? I'm not selling copies

2800
01:50:21,000 --> 01:50:23,000
of it

2801
01:50:23,000 --> 01:50:25,000
I was surprised

2802
01:50:25,000 --> 01:50:27,000
that people aren't jumping on

2803
01:50:27,000 --> 01:50:29,000
DJ Hero as much as I thought they would

2804
01:50:29,000 --> 01:50:31,000
but I can understand that because it's

2805
01:50:31,000 --> 01:50:33,000
120 dollars

2806
01:50:33,000 --> 01:50:35,000
Tony Hawk's Bride, not doing well

2807
01:50:35,000 --> 01:50:37,000
you know, once

2808
01:50:37,000 --> 01:50:39,000
again, because it's 120 dollars

2809
01:50:39,000 --> 01:50:41,000
and it's a Tony Hawk game, I'd say like

2810
01:50:41,000 --> 01:50:43,000
standard priced game that's not doing well

2811
01:50:47,000 --> 01:50:49,000
I'm putting you on the spot a little bit, I'm sorry

2812
01:50:49,000 --> 01:50:51,000
Rabbids Go Home isn't doing very well

2813
01:50:51,000 --> 01:50:53,000
not a lot of people are picking that up in large

2814
01:50:53,000 --> 01:50:55,000
quantities like the other Rabbids games

2815
01:50:55,000 --> 01:50:57,000
they're kind of getting a warning

2816
01:50:57,000 --> 01:50:59,000
I guess they're

2817
01:50:59,000 --> 01:51:01,000
they've worn out their welcome

2818
01:51:01,000 --> 01:51:03,000
I would say maybe

2819
01:51:07,000 --> 01:51:09,000
oh man

2820
01:51:09,000 --> 01:51:11,000
I had to beg and plead for

2821
01:51:11,000 --> 01:51:13,000
Demon Souls

2822
01:51:13,000 --> 01:51:15,000
and then everybody after the fact was scrambling

2823
01:51:15,000 --> 01:51:17,000
for that, I'm like dude I told you

2824
01:51:17,000 --> 01:51:19,000
you should have listened to me

2825
01:51:19,000 --> 01:51:21,000
so is that game actually moving now?

2826
01:51:21,000 --> 01:51:23,000
oh yeah it's moving, they're sold out at Atlas

2827
01:51:23,000 --> 01:51:25,000
I mean they keep selling out

2828
01:51:25,000 --> 01:51:27,000
so it's doing

2829
01:51:27,000 --> 01:51:29,000
it's probably the fastest moving

2830
01:51:29,000 --> 01:51:31,000
Atlas title I've seen

2831
01:51:31,000 --> 01:51:33,000
some of the smaller niche titles

2832
01:51:33,000 --> 01:51:35,000
even like Muramasa don't do

2833
01:51:35,000 --> 01:51:37,000
as well right off the bat

2834
01:51:37,000 --> 01:51:39,000
they hear all the buzz and it's like

2835
01:51:39,000 --> 01:51:41,000
there's people coming in asking for this, I need this right away

2836
01:51:41,000 --> 01:51:43,000
so it's not a surprise

2837
01:51:43,000 --> 01:51:45,000
but

2838
01:51:45,000 --> 01:51:47,000
I'd say probably this fall

2839
01:51:47,000 --> 01:51:49,000
the one title that's not going to do as well

2840
01:51:49,000 --> 01:51:51,000
as the company's hoping

2841
01:51:51,000 --> 01:51:53,000
I'm guessing would be Avatar

2842
01:51:53,000 --> 01:51:55,000
I don't think that's going to do that well

2843
01:51:55,000 --> 01:51:57,000
oh the one based on the movie?

2844
01:51:57,000 --> 01:51:59,000
I think that movie's going to bomb

2845
01:51:59,000 --> 01:52:01,000
I think that movie's going to be a big fucking bomb

2846
01:52:01,000 --> 01:52:03,000
I'm not knocking it, it actually looks

2847
01:52:03,000 --> 01:52:05,000
kind of neat, but I just think it's going to be

2848
01:52:05,000 --> 01:52:07,000
one of those movies that is

2849
01:52:07,000 --> 01:52:09,000
especially considering the hype is too high

2850
01:52:09,000 --> 01:52:11,000
I think that movie's going to bomb

2851
01:52:11,000 --> 01:52:13,000
of course watch me be wrong

2852
01:52:13,000 --> 01:52:15,000
who knows

2853
01:52:15,000 --> 01:52:17,000
well this is something that may not sell a lot

2854
01:52:17,000 --> 01:52:19,000
but I think this looks freaking phenomenal

2855
01:52:19,000 --> 01:52:21,000
do you guys know what a Microsoft

2856
01:52:21,000 --> 01:52:23,000
I know one, and this is really sad

2857
01:52:23,000 --> 01:52:25,000
Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles

2858
01:52:25,000 --> 01:52:27,000
The Crystal Bearers, that's a tough sell

2859
01:52:27,000 --> 01:52:29,000
no one wants to buy it because the last one was a port

2860
01:52:29,000 --> 01:52:31,000
of a DS title and everybody hated it

2861
01:52:31,000 --> 01:52:33,000
and so they're like oh Crystal Chronicles

2862
01:52:33,000 --> 01:52:35,000
I'm not bringing that shit in

2863
01:52:35,000 --> 01:52:37,000
well I want to show you guys

2864
01:52:37,000 --> 01:52:39,000
a little bit of this, how many of you guys know what a Microsoft

2865
01:52:39,000 --> 01:52:41,000
Surface is?

2866
01:52:41,000 --> 01:52:43,000
aren't those like the giant

2867
01:52:43,000 --> 01:52:45,000
tables, like we saw one at Penny Arcade

2868
01:52:45,000 --> 01:52:47,000
yeah we played with the Google Maps on there

2869
01:52:47,000 --> 01:52:49,000
yeah, us and Bobby were kind of like

2870
01:52:49,000 --> 01:52:51,000
we were giving each other tours of our neighborhoods

2871
01:52:51,000 --> 01:52:53,000
on the Microsoft Surface on the Google Maps

2872
01:52:53,000 --> 01:52:55,000
I took you guys to Alabama, that's right

2873
01:52:55,000 --> 01:52:57,000
the Surface tables are a lot of fun, it's like a gigantic

2874
01:52:57,000 --> 01:52:59,000
iPhone, which is probably

2875
01:52:59,000 --> 01:53:01,000
not what Microsoft would want me to call it

2876
01:53:01,000 --> 01:53:03,000
I don't know what it is, well I gotta say

2877
01:53:03,000 --> 01:53:05,000
this looks rad

2878
01:53:05,000 --> 01:53:07,000
this is a little game called Surfacecapes

2879
01:53:07,000 --> 01:53:09,000
and they're calling it a proof of concept

2880
01:53:09,000 --> 01:53:11,000
project, it is using

2881
01:53:11,000 --> 01:53:13,000
the Microsoft Surface table to play

2882
01:53:13,000 --> 01:53:15,000
Dungeons and Dragons essentially

2883
01:53:15,000 --> 01:53:17,000
it's using the Surface table

2884
01:53:17,000 --> 01:53:19,000
get this, you can actually plot out little pieces

2885
01:53:19,000 --> 01:53:21,000
on the map, and they actually show you

2886
01:53:21,000 --> 01:53:23,000
a little tour of this, you can put pieces on the grid

2887
01:53:23,000 --> 01:53:25,000
so you can actually, you know how like people get out

2888
01:53:25,000 --> 01:53:27,000
their big charts and their pen and paper

2889
01:53:27,000 --> 01:53:29,000
to move characters around, imagine

2890
01:53:29,000 --> 01:53:31,000
being able to do all that on the Surface, and look at that

2891
01:53:31,000 --> 01:53:33,000
D20 flying in that you can actually roll there

2892
01:53:33,000 --> 01:53:35,000
virtually, and you can't cheat

2893
01:53:35,000 --> 01:53:37,000
you can do that virtually

2894
01:53:37,000 --> 01:53:39,000
there on the Microsoft Surface, and you can actually

2895
01:53:39,000 --> 01:53:41,000
move these little pieces around

2896
01:53:41,000 --> 01:53:43,000
now this is going to make the nerds

2897
01:53:43,000 --> 01:53:45,000
want to have one of these in their home, I think this is

2898
01:53:45,000 --> 01:53:47,000
pretty cool, having this, this is

2899
01:53:47,000 --> 01:53:49,000
just a proof of concept for right now

2900
01:53:49,000 --> 01:53:51,000
but I think a lot of people have looked at these

2901
01:53:51,000 --> 01:53:53,000
Surfaces going, what do you do with it?

2902
01:53:53,000 --> 01:53:55,000
like there's not a lot

2903
01:53:55,000 --> 01:53:57,000
to do here, but this is

2904
01:53:57,000 --> 01:53:59,000
really expensive too

2905
01:53:59,000 --> 01:54:01,000
oh I'm sure, I mean I've never seen one

2906
01:54:01,000 --> 01:54:03,000
outside of that one hotel, and it seems

2907
01:54:03,000 --> 01:54:05,000
like that's where you're going to see them, is like in

2908
01:54:05,000 --> 01:54:07,000
the lobbies of hotels for people

2909
01:54:07,000 --> 01:54:09,000
to find like coffee shops and

2910
01:54:09,000 --> 01:54:11,000
expensive restaurants they want to

2911
01:54:11,000 --> 01:54:13,000
go to and so forth

2912
01:54:13,000 --> 01:54:15,000
Salaciouspopnchat says some casinos in Vegas are starting

2913
01:54:15,000 --> 01:54:17,000
to use it, yeah I can see that too

2914
01:54:17,000 --> 01:54:19,000
Redertainment says Microsoft Surface is a

2915
01:54:19,000 --> 01:54:21,000
cool thing to play around with, it's

2916
01:54:21,000 --> 01:54:23,000
like watching TV while high without

2917
01:54:23,000 --> 01:54:25,000
actually being high

2918
01:54:25,000 --> 01:54:27,000
it certainly is

2919
01:54:27,000 --> 01:54:29,000
something a little different, it's

2920
01:54:29,000 --> 01:54:31,000
a cool little device, I think it just might be a little ahead of

2921
01:54:31,000 --> 01:54:33,000
its time, like it's not the kind of thing people are going to have

2922
01:54:33,000 --> 01:54:35,000
in their homes, you're not going to be replacing your

2923
01:54:35,000 --> 01:54:37,000
coffee table with the Surface at any time soon

2924
01:54:37,000 --> 01:54:39,000
I will, but then again I don't have a coffee table

2925
01:54:39,000 --> 01:54:41,000
yeah don't, don't spill a drink

2926
01:54:41,000 --> 01:54:43,000
on it though or you're fucked, I mean that's the

2927
01:54:43,000 --> 01:54:45,000
other nervous thing about it, of course

2928
01:54:45,000 --> 01:54:47,000
then again, I've dropped my iPhone I don't know

2929
01:54:47,000 --> 01:54:49,000
how many times and it still works, but I also put a

2930
01:54:49,000 --> 01:54:51,000
protective case on it, so

2931
01:54:51,000 --> 01:54:53,000
I've dropped mine on concrete

2932
01:54:53,000 --> 01:54:55,000
and it hasn't broken, and I don't have a case

2933
01:54:55,000 --> 01:54:57,000
on mine, wow

2934
01:54:57,000 --> 01:54:59,000
see I have a big thick case on mine

2935
01:54:59,000 --> 01:55:01,000
because when I got my iPhone I said, okay

2936
01:55:01,000 --> 01:55:03,000
I know this guy is going to get dropped

2937
01:55:03,000 --> 01:55:05,000
so I need to figure out a case I can put

2938
01:55:05,000 --> 01:55:07,000
on it, wow you don't even have a protective screen on it

2939
01:55:07,000 --> 01:55:09,000
do you, that's pretty amazing

2940
01:55:09,000 --> 01:55:11,000
nope, wow, look at the back of it

2941
01:55:11,000 --> 01:55:13,000
that's not bad at all, but then again

2942
01:55:13,000 --> 01:55:15,000
here's the silver, I didn't even know they made them

2943
01:55:15,000 --> 01:55:17,000
the original ones, I have an old school

2944
01:55:17,000 --> 01:55:19,000
iPhone, interesting

2945
01:55:19,000 --> 01:55:21,000
which I'm going to auction off when I get

2946
01:55:21,000 --> 01:55:23,000
my 3GS for a holiday

2947
01:55:23,000 --> 01:55:25,000
I think those things are pretty waterproof

2948
01:55:25,000 --> 01:55:27,000
because it looks like, you know, they have a picture

2949
01:55:27,000 --> 01:55:29,000
like a fancy picture, it looks like someone

2950
01:55:29,000 --> 01:55:31,000
in a casino, they have their

2951
01:55:31,000 --> 01:55:33,000
drinks set on it, I think that because

2952
01:55:33,000 --> 01:55:35,000
the monitor is actually so inside of it

2953
01:55:35,000 --> 01:55:37,000
you know, and the table

2954
01:55:37,000 --> 01:55:39,000
goes way beyond the actual monitor

2955
01:55:39,000 --> 01:55:41,000
if you spilled something on it it would just drip over the edge

2956
01:55:41,000 --> 01:55:43,000
one more comment from Redertainment

2957
01:55:43,000 --> 01:55:45,000
NBC News used Surface during their

2958
01:55:45,000 --> 01:55:47,000
2008 election coverage, yeah

2959
01:55:47,000 --> 01:55:49,000
and also that probably has a lot

2960
01:55:49,000 --> 01:55:51,000
to do with Microsoft and NBC

2961
01:55:51,000 --> 01:55:53,000
collaborating on a lot of stuff, I mean

2962
01:55:53,000 --> 01:55:55,000
MSNBC, hello, but then, you know

2963
01:55:55,000 --> 01:55:57,000
I like

2964
01:55:57,000 --> 01:55:59,000
watching election year coverage because that's

2965
01:55:59,000 --> 01:56:01,000
when all the channels try to roll out their new technology

2966
01:56:01,000 --> 01:56:03,000
to get you to watch them, remember when CNN

2967
01:56:03,000 --> 01:56:05,000
did the holograms

2968
01:56:05,000 --> 01:56:07,000
like the most pointless thing ever

2969
01:56:07,000 --> 01:56:09,000
it was just like a cool technology to show

2970
01:56:09,000 --> 01:56:11,000
off, so

2971
01:56:11,000 --> 01:56:13,000
Amanda giving us a warning in chat

2972
01:56:13,000 --> 01:56:15,000
I dropped my iPhone the other night

2973
01:56:15,000 --> 01:56:17,000
and totally cracked the screen

2974
01:56:17,000 --> 01:56:19,000
I don't know how many times I dropped it

2975
01:56:19,000 --> 01:56:21,000
before and it had been fine, Dan did

2976
01:56:21,000 --> 01:56:23,000
his first time, he got his, he cracked it in his

2977
01:56:23,000 --> 01:56:25,000
pocket, so careful, careful folks

2978
01:56:25,000 --> 01:56:27,000
yeah, I don't think I'll be buying one of these

2979
01:56:27,000 --> 01:56:29,000
they're $12,000

2980
01:56:29,000 --> 01:56:31,000
or $12,500

2981
01:56:31,000 --> 01:56:33,000
but you know

2982
01:56:33,000 --> 01:56:35,000
like in five years

2983
01:56:35,000 --> 01:56:37,000
that price, remember when HDTVs

2984
01:56:37,000 --> 01:56:39,000
were $8,000, I'm sorry, it's still way too damn

2985
01:56:39,000 --> 01:56:41,000
expensive, you get an HDTV, put a

2986
01:56:41,000 --> 01:56:43,000
nice touchscreen interface on it

2987
01:56:43,000 --> 01:56:45,000
Surface, done, I mean you don't really

2988
01:56:45,000 --> 01:56:47,000
I don't understand why this stuff's so expensive

2989
01:56:47,000 --> 01:56:49,000
it's not $12,000 unit

2990
01:56:49,000 --> 01:56:51,000
I mean, come on

2991
01:56:51,000 --> 01:56:53,000
Salacious Pop was just asking as we were talking about it on air

2992
01:56:53,000 --> 01:56:55,000
cause there's a little delay, LOL, what channel did

2993
01:56:55,000 --> 01:56:57,000
the Princess Leia shit

2994
01:56:57,000 --> 01:56:59,000
that's a great way to describe what CNN did that year

2995
01:56:59,000 --> 01:57:01,000
and Redertainment follows up with

2996
01:57:01,000 --> 01:57:03,000
Wolf Blitzer

2997
01:57:03,000 --> 01:57:05,000
I am your father

2998
01:57:05,000 --> 01:57:07,000
love it, so wrong, funny, funny, funny

2999
01:57:07,000 --> 01:57:09,000
I don't know if you happened to catch the soup

3000
01:57:09,000 --> 01:57:11,000
this week, they had a thing, no, I stopped

3001
01:57:11,000 --> 01:57:13,000
watching that show, not that, I love Joel McHale

3002
01:57:13,000 --> 01:57:15,000
I just always forget to TV

3003
01:57:15,000 --> 01:57:17,000
they had a funny quote, it was a show

3004
01:57:17,000 --> 01:57:19,000
about celebrities that saw ghosts

3005
01:57:19,000 --> 01:57:21,000
or something, but she was talking about

3006
01:57:21,000 --> 01:57:23,000
her friend or something that

3007
01:57:23,000 --> 01:57:25,000
he's a gay Republican who's a

3008
01:57:25,000 --> 01:57:27,000
drug addict or something like that, but the way she said it

3009
01:57:27,000 --> 01:57:29,000
was hilarious, sounds like my ex

3010
01:57:29,000 --> 01:57:31,000
oh, snap, alright, snap

3011
01:57:31,000 --> 01:57:33,000
alright, I was just thinking it only

3012
01:57:33,000 --> 01:57:35,000
I had the tact to not say it aloud, awe

3013
01:57:35,000 --> 01:57:37,000
let's see

3014
01:57:37,000 --> 01:57:39,000
really random topic, and then we're gonna get it into

3015
01:57:39,000 --> 01:57:41,000
the mailbag, your email's at

3016
01:57:41,000 --> 01:57:43,000
orangelessradio.com, DarkSakura will read here in a moment

3017
01:57:43,000 --> 01:57:45,000
but I'm gonna throw out this completely random

3018
01:57:45,000 --> 01:57:47,000
question from chat, it's like

3019
01:57:47,000 --> 01:57:49,000
throw random questions at Loki night, I swear

3020
01:57:49,000 --> 01:57:51,000
Deekman is asking, Loki

3021
01:57:51,000 --> 01:57:53,000
did you see this announcement that a custom

3022
01:57:53,000 --> 01:57:55,000
firmware for the PSP 3000 is supposed to be

3023
01:57:55,000 --> 01:57:57,000
released next week

3024
01:57:57,000 --> 01:57:59,000
that's like every week, I mean

3025
01:57:59,000 --> 01:58:01,000
I'm sorry, like, which custom

3026
01:58:01,000 --> 01:58:03,000
firmware, who's making it, what

3027
01:58:03,000 --> 01:58:05,000
is it, I haven't even bothered to look

3028
01:58:05,000 --> 01:58:07,000
just because I'm so sick

3029
01:58:07,000 --> 01:58:09,000
and tired of, like, I got to the

3030
01:58:09,000 --> 01:58:11,000
point where you can convert

3031
01:58:11,000 --> 01:58:13,000
some games to run with certain other

3032
01:58:13,000 --> 01:58:15,000
firmwares and stuff

3033
01:58:15,000 --> 01:58:17,000
alright, I'm gonna

3034
01:58:17,000 --> 01:58:19,000
go look at this

3035
01:58:19,000 --> 01:58:21,000
alright, you look it up, in the mean time

3036
01:58:21,000 --> 01:58:23,000
DarkSakura's gonna dive into the mailbag

3037
01:58:23,000 --> 01:58:25,000
mailbag at orangelessradio.com

3038
01:58:25,000 --> 01:58:27,000
and read your emails

3039
01:58:27,000 --> 01:58:29,000
cause, dang it, you send us emails

3040
01:58:29,000 --> 01:58:31,000
and show us a little love, so we show you

3041
01:58:31,000 --> 01:58:33,000
some love back in a little segment we call the mailbag

3042
01:58:33,000 --> 01:58:35,000
alright, um

3043
01:58:35,000 --> 01:58:37,000
hi LLR, thanks for reading my

3044
01:58:37,000 --> 01:58:39,000
twitter question that's upon playing

3045
01:58:39,000 --> 01:58:41,000
on the short show about the

3046
01:58:41,000 --> 01:58:43,000
official Konami DDR tournament

3047
01:58:43,000 --> 01:58:45,000
following up on it, I was wondering what you guys

3048
01:58:45,000 --> 01:58:47,000
thought about the age restrictions on Konami's

3049
01:58:47,000 --> 01:58:49,000
official DDR tournament, I have enclosed a snippet

3050
01:58:49,000 --> 01:58:51,000
about it on the official summary

3051
01:58:51,000 --> 01:58:53,000
all registrants must be between the ages of 13

3052
01:58:53,000 --> 01:58:55,000
and 32 years as of

3053
01:58:55,000 --> 01:58:57,000
April 1, 2009

3054
01:58:57,000 --> 01:58:59,000
according to these rules, I actually would be

3055
01:58:59,000 --> 01:59:01,000
ineligible to compete next year if there was another

3056
01:59:01,000 --> 01:59:03,000
tournament, I'm not sure what

3057
01:59:03,000 --> 01:59:05,000
to think, maybe they

3058
01:59:05,000 --> 01:59:07,000
are thinking someone hits 32 they fall apart

3059
01:59:07,000 --> 01:59:09,000
anyway, give it the good work

3060
01:59:09,000 --> 01:59:11,000
peace out and triple A

3061
01:59:11,000 --> 01:59:13,000
that's from uh

3062
01:59:13,000 --> 01:59:15,000
Jammer J

3063
01:59:15,000 --> 01:59:17,000
I think that's stupid

3064
01:59:17,000 --> 01:59:19,000
it's incredibly stupid and kind of

3065
01:59:19,000 --> 01:59:21,000
insulting, especially to the fanbase that kind of

3066
01:59:21,000 --> 01:59:23,000
helped DDR get big, but this is

3067
01:59:23,000 --> 01:59:25,000
exactly why I had no idea

3068
01:59:25,000 --> 01:59:27,000
about this until you mentioned it, because guess what

3069
01:59:27,000 --> 01:59:29,000
I stopped following it, so maybe that's why

3070
01:59:29,000 --> 01:59:31,000
I'm not allowed to participate

3071
01:59:31,000 --> 01:59:33,000
next year I will be able to participate

3072
01:59:33,000 --> 01:59:35,000
I was 32 April 1, 2009

3073
01:59:35,000 --> 01:59:37,000
I know, I know

3074
01:59:37,000 --> 01:59:39,000
it's ridiculous

3075
01:59:39,000 --> 01:59:41,000
I mean, it

3076
01:59:41,000 --> 01:59:43,000
whatever, if you want to

3077
01:59:43,000 --> 01:59:45,000
alienate some of your potential fans

3078
01:59:45,000 --> 01:59:47,000
that way, go for it, whatever

3079
01:59:49,000 --> 01:59:51,000
ugh, I need a new nose, Rob

3080
01:59:51,000 --> 01:59:53,000
I'm kind of, it's weird

3081
01:59:53,000 --> 01:59:55,000
I am and I'm not over the DDR

3082
01:59:55,000 --> 01:59:57,000
thing, like some days I go

3083
01:59:57,000 --> 01:59:59,000
I'm so done with DDR, like it's just

3084
01:59:59,000 --> 02:00:01,000
not cool anymore, but then I go

3085
02:00:01,000 --> 02:00:03,000
I kind of want that new one on the 360 PS3

3086
02:00:03,000 --> 02:00:05,000
it looks kind of awesome, my sheet metal

3087
02:00:05,000 --> 02:00:07,000
came in the other day

3088
02:00:07,000 --> 02:00:09,000
you know what that's for, right?

3089
02:00:09,000 --> 02:00:11,000
I know, for your little DDR project

3090
02:00:11,000 --> 02:00:13,000
and, but you're still in your 20s

3091
02:00:13,000 --> 02:00:15,000
so whatever, oh whatever

3092
02:00:15,000 --> 02:00:17,000
I mean, barely, oh god

3093
02:00:17,000 --> 02:00:19,000
you young whippersnapper

3094
02:00:19,000 --> 02:00:21,000
in your DDR mat

3095
02:00:21,000 --> 02:00:23,000
listen, okay, I went

3096
02:00:23,000 --> 02:00:25,000
so far as getting official

3097
02:00:25,000 --> 02:00:27,000
Konami

3098
02:00:27,000 --> 02:00:29,000
stickers from the arcade machine that are gonna

3099
02:00:29,000 --> 02:00:31,000
go on this thing, I mean that's how

3100
02:00:31,000 --> 02:00:33,000
awesome it's gonna look

3101
02:00:33,000 --> 02:00:35,000
well how do you feel that in, you know, 4 years or whatever

3102
02:00:35,000 --> 02:00:37,000
you're dead to Konami

3103
02:00:37,000 --> 02:00:39,000
Dead Man Walking, Dead Man Dancing

3104
02:00:39,000 --> 02:00:41,000
I don't buy their games

3105
02:00:41,000 --> 02:00:43,000
oh, maybe that should be the next game that comes out

3106
02:00:43,000 --> 02:00:45,000
it's like Zombies Ate My Neighbors combined with DDR, Dead Man Dancing

3107
02:00:45,000 --> 02:00:47,000
dude, I have a way to fix their whole franchise

3108
02:00:47,000 --> 02:00:49,000
but no, let's add 8 arrows

3109
02:00:49,000 --> 02:00:51,000
to it, that'll be awesome

3110
02:00:51,000 --> 02:00:53,000
oh, well, are we actually gonna do step charts

3111
02:00:53,000 --> 02:00:55,000
that support those 8 arrows?

3112
02:00:55,000 --> 02:00:57,000
no, we're just gonna use some programs

3113
02:00:57,000 --> 02:00:59,000
to integrate these arrows for you

3114
02:00:59,000 --> 02:01:01,000
that's awesome, because that works so well with quads

3115
02:01:03,000 --> 02:01:05,000
yeah, over DDR, sorry

3116
02:01:05,000 --> 02:01:07,000
which is just a scam to get you to buy

3117
02:01:07,000 --> 02:01:09,000
you know, more dance mats

3118
02:01:09,000 --> 02:01:11,000
I know we have a lot of listeners

3119
02:01:11,000 --> 02:01:13,000
that are still attached to the music games

3120
02:01:13,000 --> 02:01:15,000
and yes, we founded the station on it

3121
02:01:15,000 --> 02:01:17,000
but I guess, you know, now that some of us are

3122
02:01:17,000 --> 02:01:19,000
getting that 32 threshold, I guess we are officially

3123
02:01:19,000 --> 02:01:21,000
too old for DDR

3124
02:01:21,000 --> 02:01:23,000
well, here's the other thing too, I mean, look at their game releases

3125
02:01:23,000 --> 02:01:25,000
for DDR, they're not doing

3126
02:01:25,000 --> 02:01:27,000
game only releases

3127
02:01:27,000 --> 02:01:29,000
not until like, way later on

3128
02:01:29,000 --> 02:01:31,000
so if you wanna really stick with DDR

3129
02:01:31,000 --> 02:01:33,000
and buy a new release each year, guess what

3130
02:01:33,000 --> 02:01:35,000
you're gonna get a soft mat to go with that release

3131
02:01:35,000 --> 02:01:37,000
and it's gonna be $10 more than they would normally be

3132
02:01:37,000 --> 02:01:39,000
by itself

3133
02:01:39,000 --> 02:01:41,000
however, I will say this

3134
02:01:41,000 --> 02:01:43,000
if Beatmania 2DX or whatever goes to PlayStation 3

3135
02:01:43,000 --> 02:01:45,000
I'm very interested in what's next

3136
02:01:45,000 --> 02:01:47,000
for that franchise, because I've always loved Beatmania

3137
02:01:47,000 --> 02:01:49,000
well, if it goes to the PlayStation 3, you can import that shit

3138
02:01:49,000 --> 02:01:51,000
ooh, I didn't even think of that

3139
02:01:51,000 --> 02:01:53,000
good point, my man, good point

3140
02:01:53,000 --> 02:01:55,000
anyhow

3141
02:01:55,000 --> 02:01:57,000
more emails, sorry

3142
02:01:57,000 --> 02:01:59,000
sorry, I'm kind of feeling like crap right now

3143
02:01:59,000 --> 02:02:07,000
this one is a Kingdom Hearts 358 two day mini review

3144
02:02:07,000 --> 02:02:11,000
it's like, well I'm saying this because you guys probably aren't gonna play the game

3145
02:02:11,000 --> 02:02:15,000
so I thought that writing a review would help motivate you guys to buy it or at least rent it

3146
02:02:15,000 --> 02:02:17,000
I beat it in a week, dude, please use punctuation

3147
02:02:17,000 --> 02:02:19,000
and capitalize your thing, cause

3148
02:02:19,000 --> 02:02:21,000
I saw a commercial for the game on TV today

3149
02:02:21,000 --> 02:02:23,000
just random thought

3150
02:02:23,000 --> 02:02:25,000
I never made it through the first game

3151
02:02:25,000 --> 02:02:27,000
or played the second game

3152
02:02:27,000 --> 02:02:29,000
or played the DS game

3153
02:02:29,000 --> 02:02:31,000
I glitched my second game

3154
02:02:31,000 --> 02:02:33,000
or played the PlayStation 2 port of the Gameboy Advance game

3155
02:02:33,000 --> 02:02:35,000
so I'm so lost in it right now

3156
02:02:35,000 --> 02:02:39,000
that I just am not gonna even bother

3157
02:02:39,000 --> 02:02:41,000
I'm gonna sum this up

3158
02:02:41,000 --> 02:02:43,000
you play as Roxas

3159
02:02:43,000 --> 02:02:45,000
and he gives it an 8

3160
02:02:45,000 --> 02:02:47,000
so like, I don't even know who Roxas is

3161
02:02:47,000 --> 02:02:49,000
I mean, I know who he is

3162
02:02:49,000 --> 02:02:51,000
but this character means nothing to me

3163
02:02:51,000 --> 02:02:53,000
re-write your review with proper grammar

3164
02:02:53,000 --> 02:02:55,000
and spelling and everything

3165
02:02:55,000 --> 02:02:57,000
and I'll put it up on the site

3166
02:02:57,000 --> 02:02:59,000
I do love the Kingdom Hearts games

3167
02:02:59,000 --> 02:03:01,000
but I'm just not interested in these handheld ones

3168
02:03:01,000 --> 02:03:03,000
and this all goes back to my whole

3169
02:03:03,000 --> 02:03:05,000
I'm just not as big of a fan of handheld games

3170
02:03:05,000 --> 02:03:07,000
as I am playing them on my big TV

3171
02:03:07,000 --> 02:03:09,000
so I'll wait until the next

3172
02:03:09,000 --> 02:03:11,000
big official Kingdom Hearts 3

3173
02:03:11,000 --> 02:03:13,000
comes out and leave all these side stories

3174
02:03:13,000 --> 02:03:15,000
on the side

3175
02:03:15,000 --> 02:03:17,000
alright, this one comes from

3176
02:03:17,000 --> 02:03:19,000
AZHP

3177
02:03:47,000 --> 02:03:49,000
gross

3178
02:04:03,000 --> 02:04:07,000
most of those stores are franchised anyway

3179
02:04:07,000 --> 02:04:09,000
so

3180
02:04:09,000 --> 02:04:11,000
well, they closed one not far from here

3181
02:04:11,000 --> 02:04:13,000
the one that was in the Target lot closed

3182
02:04:13,000 --> 02:04:15,000
yeah, but I don't work over there

3183
02:04:15,000 --> 02:04:17,000
but, you know

3184
02:04:17,000 --> 02:04:19,000
they're not all doing great

3185
02:04:19,000 --> 02:04:21,000
mmmkay

3186
02:04:21,000 --> 02:04:23,000
ooh, we got an angry letter

3187
02:04:23,000 --> 02:04:25,000
angry letter

3188
02:04:25,000 --> 02:04:27,000
I love angry emails, yay

3189
02:04:27,000 --> 02:04:29,000
and thankfully I sound like crap now

3190
02:04:29,000 --> 02:04:31,000
dear OLR

3191
02:04:31,000 --> 02:04:33,000
I listened to the podcast of the October 18th show

3192
02:04:33,000 --> 02:04:35,000
and was honestly astounded at what I heard

3193
02:04:35,000 --> 02:04:37,000
upon reflection, what did I expect to come out of the mouths of people

3194
02:04:37,000 --> 02:04:39,000
who live in the liberal enclave

3195
02:04:39,000 --> 02:04:41,000
that is California

3196
02:04:41,000 --> 02:04:43,000
how can you stand behind the possible presidency

3197
02:04:43,000 --> 02:04:45,000
of Cat?

3198
02:04:45,000 --> 02:04:47,000
Cat has little foreign animal experience

3199
02:04:47,000 --> 02:04:49,000
and no executive experience

3200
02:04:49,000 --> 02:04:51,000
and likes the coherent strategy to deal with the growing threat

3201
02:04:51,000 --> 02:04:53,000
presented by radical fundamental fleas

3202
02:04:53,000 --> 02:04:55,000
I even doubt that Cat

3203
02:04:55,000 --> 02:04:57,000
is even from this country

3204
02:04:57,000 --> 02:04:59,000
I heard that Cat is a Persian

3205
02:04:59,000 --> 02:05:01,000
any rational person knows that the true

3206
02:05:01,000 --> 02:05:03,000
and correct choice for president is Dog

3207
02:05:03,000 --> 02:05:05,000
Dog has expressed his bath-based

3208
02:05:05,000 --> 02:05:07,000
strategy for dealing with threat of fleas

3209
02:05:07,000 --> 02:05:09,000
once and for all

3210
02:05:09,000 --> 02:05:11,000
Dog has a steady paw and is loyal to our

3211
02:05:11,000 --> 02:05:13,000
president, President Burrow

3212
02:05:13,000 --> 02:05:15,000
yes, Dog has

3213
02:05:15,000 --> 02:05:17,000
chased cars in the past, but after accepting

3214
02:05:17,000 --> 02:05:19,000
Jesus as his lord and master

3215
02:05:19,000 --> 02:05:21,000
I can assure you that Dog will never chase cars again

3216
02:05:21,000 --> 02:05:23,000
when you step into the gaming

3217
02:05:23,000 --> 02:05:25,000
arena on Tuesday, remember who is

3218
02:05:25,000 --> 02:05:27,000
stuck by you like a loyal friend who treats you

3219
02:05:27,000 --> 02:05:29,000
like you are its pet

3220
02:05:29,000 --> 02:05:31,000
and not the dominant person you are

3221
02:05:31,000 --> 02:05:33,000
vote for Dog for president

3222
02:05:33,000 --> 02:05:35,000
do it or the fleas win

3223
02:05:35,000 --> 02:05:37,000
thanks for letting me listen from the conservative Eden that is Utah

3224
02:05:37,000 --> 02:05:39,000
Reddertainment

3225
02:05:39,000 --> 02:05:41,000
Dog has been brought to you by Glenn Beck

3226
02:05:41,000 --> 02:05:43,000
a smart, rational, and insane voice for the future

3227
02:05:43,000 --> 02:05:45,000
if that isn't proof that I'm clearly kidding

3228
02:05:45,000 --> 02:05:47,000
what else can I say?

3229
02:05:47,000 --> 02:05:49,000
Well, I'd have to say that Dog has been

3230
02:05:49,000 --> 02:05:51,000
known to eat poop

3231
02:05:51,000 --> 02:05:53,000
and honestly, Dog thinks

3232
02:05:53,000 --> 02:05:55,000
I threw something when I just faked them out

3233
02:05:55,000 --> 02:05:57,000
so I don't really know if I can trust

3234
02:05:57,000 --> 02:05:59,000
Dog to

3235
02:05:59,000 --> 02:06:01,000
you know, not drool

3236
02:06:01,000 --> 02:06:03,000
on the issues

3237
02:06:03,000 --> 02:06:05,000
I can rely on Cat to be self-sufficient

3238
02:06:05,000 --> 02:06:07,000
except for Shermy, who is just fat and lean

3239
02:06:07,000 --> 02:06:09,000
Cat has eaten hair

3240
02:06:09,000 --> 02:06:11,000
so, you know, that's not as bad as poop

3241
02:06:11,000 --> 02:06:13,000
but still, both candidates have their flaws

3242
02:06:13,000 --> 02:06:15,000
Reddertainment, you ignorant slut

3243
02:06:15,000 --> 02:06:17,000
no, I'm just kidding

3244
02:06:17,000 --> 02:06:19,000
actually, that was like the email of the century

3245
02:06:19,000 --> 02:06:21,000
loved it

3246
02:06:21,000 --> 02:06:23,000
Gold Star for you, sir

3247
02:06:23,000 --> 02:06:25,000
I think that is worthy of the Gold Star

3248
02:06:25,000 --> 02:06:27,000
email bag segment recipient

3249
02:06:27,000 --> 02:06:29,000
wouldn't you agree, DarkSakura?

3250
02:06:29,000 --> 02:06:31,000
Was proper grammar and punctuation all that used?

3251
02:06:31,000 --> 02:06:33,000
So there you go, Gold Star recipient

3252
02:06:33,000 --> 02:06:35,000
applause to you

3253
02:06:35,000 --> 02:06:37,000
I closed the fanfare

3254
02:06:37,000 --> 02:06:39,000
There's your fanfare

3255
02:06:41,000 --> 02:06:43,000
Well done there, Rob

3256
02:06:43,000 --> 02:06:45,000
Thank you

3257
02:06:45,000 --> 02:06:47,000
Does my fanfare get a Gold Star?

3258
02:06:47,000 --> 02:06:49,000
Your fanfare gets a

3259
02:06:49,000 --> 02:06:51,000
My god, you're like

3260
02:06:51,000 --> 02:06:53,000
really sick over there, aren't you?

3261
02:06:53,000 --> 02:06:55,000
It's the dust in the room

3262
02:06:55,000 --> 02:06:57,000
What's the dust in the room?

3263
02:06:57,000 --> 02:06:59,000
No, I opened up my old

3264
02:06:59,000 --> 02:07:01,000
laptop case to try to find my SD card

3265
02:07:01,000 --> 02:07:03,000
reader and it kicked up

3266
02:07:03,000 --> 02:07:05,000
a crap ton of dust

3267
02:07:05,000 --> 02:07:07,000
So, yeah

3268
02:07:07,000 --> 02:07:09,000
All we are is dust in the room

3269
02:07:09,000 --> 02:07:11,000
That's the official campaign

3270
02:07:11,000 --> 02:07:13,000
song, by the way, of President Cat

3271
02:07:13,000 --> 02:07:15,000
Not really

3272
02:07:15,000 --> 02:07:17,000
Is that it for emails tonight?

3273
02:07:17,000 --> 02:07:19,000
Mailbag at Orange Lounge Radio

3274
02:07:19,000 --> 02:07:21,000
That's all I'm fucking reading

3275
02:07:21,000 --> 02:07:23,000
Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com

3276
02:07:23,000 --> 02:07:25,000
if you want to send your email

3277
02:07:25,000 --> 02:07:27,000
for possible reading

3278
02:07:27,000 --> 02:07:29,000
on the air next week

3279
02:07:29,000 --> 02:07:31,000
How much of that is getting picked up by the mics?

3280
02:07:31,000 --> 02:07:33,000
Probably a lot

3281
02:07:33,000 --> 02:07:35,000
I don't care, my nose feels

3282
02:07:35,000 --> 02:07:37,000
like crap

3283
02:07:37,000 --> 02:07:39,000
Hey, we want to get into the FUs of the week

3284
02:07:39,000 --> 02:07:41,000
actually, before we get back into

3285
02:07:41,000 --> 02:07:43,000
the little show here

3286
02:07:43,000 --> 02:07:45,000
and the news stories

3287
02:07:45,000 --> 02:07:47,000
No story to inspire

3288
02:07:47,000 --> 02:07:49,000
our FUs of the week tonight

3289
02:07:49,000 --> 02:07:51,000
I have a story

3290
02:07:51,000 --> 02:07:53,000
I hate my nose, that's the story

3291
02:07:53,000 --> 02:08:05,000
of the media

3292
02:08:05,000 --> 02:08:07,000
This is fucked up

3293
02:08:07,000 --> 02:08:09,000
FU to my nose

3294
02:08:09,000 --> 02:08:11,000
and dust

3295
02:08:11,000 --> 02:08:13,000
and did I mention

3296
02:08:13,000 --> 02:08:15,000
my nose? Because FU to my

3297
02:08:15,000 --> 02:08:17,000
fucking nose and the fucking dust

3298
02:08:17,000 --> 02:08:19,000
FU to people

3299
02:08:19,000 --> 02:08:21,000
that have a story about everything

3300
02:08:21,000 --> 02:08:23,000
and I mean, like, we were watching

3301
02:08:23,000 --> 02:08:25,000
people on the subway

3302
02:08:25,000 --> 02:08:27,000
you know, riding Bart this weekend

3303
02:08:27,000 --> 02:08:29,000
and there was

3304
02:08:29,000 --> 02:08:31,000
on the way there, a woman who was talking

3305
02:08:31,000 --> 02:08:33,000
about, you know, for some

3306
02:08:33,000 --> 02:08:35,000
reason, she was going like

3307
02:08:35,000 --> 02:08:37,000
oh, I hope you have fun today and that

3308
02:08:37,000 --> 02:08:39,000
turned into like, yeah, my daughter

3309
02:08:39,000 --> 02:08:41,000
went to this convention and she got

3310
02:08:41,000 --> 02:08:43,000
to see Miley Cyrus and blah blah blah

3311
02:08:43,000 --> 02:08:45,000
blah blah blah blah blah and it's like, yeah, well

3312
02:08:45,000 --> 02:08:47,000
you know, my daughter lives

3313
02:08:47,000 --> 02:08:49,000
in Texas now, oh, and we went to Texas

3314
02:08:49,000 --> 02:08:51,000
then there was this bum

3315
02:08:51,000 --> 02:08:53,000
that did the same thing, talking

3316
02:08:53,000 --> 02:08:55,000
to this blind woman, so not only is she blind

3317
02:08:55,000 --> 02:08:57,000
she's being berated by this

3318
02:08:57,000 --> 02:08:59,000
guy who says he's rich, but yet

3319
02:08:59,000 --> 02:09:01,000
has a bag full of cans with him

3320
02:09:01,000 --> 02:09:03,000
so that's bullshit

3321
02:09:03,000 --> 02:09:05,000
Maybe he's into recycling

3322
02:09:05,000 --> 02:09:07,000
Maybe he's rich in cans

3323
02:09:07,000 --> 02:09:09,000
because cans is the new currency

3324
02:09:09,000 --> 02:09:11,000
Yeah, I'm under

3325
02:09:11,000 --> 02:09:13,000
the regime of President Cat

3326
02:09:13,000 --> 02:09:15,000
But he, Catnip

3327
02:09:15,000 --> 02:09:17,000
is the new currency

3328
02:09:17,000 --> 02:09:19,000
But, it's just, these

3329
02:09:19,000 --> 02:09:21,000
people though, just annoy

3330
02:09:21,000 --> 02:09:23,000
the hell out of me, that like, try to one up

3331
02:09:23,000 --> 02:09:25,000
everybody's stories and stuff like that, you know

3332
02:09:25,000 --> 02:09:27,000
how they have, you know, oh yeah

3333
02:09:27,000 --> 02:09:29,000
my cousin lives there, and oh

3334
02:09:29,000 --> 02:09:31,000
I went there and did sheet metal work

3335
02:09:31,000 --> 02:09:33,000
and oh, and my dog was

3336
02:09:33,000 --> 02:09:35,000
from that country and stuff, and like

3337
02:09:35,000 --> 02:09:37,000
Is there a character like that on Saturday Night Live?

3338
02:09:37,000 --> 02:09:39,000
Yes, there is. Alright, yeah, yeah, yeah

3339
02:09:39,000 --> 02:09:41,000
I had ten baby cows

3340
02:09:41,000 --> 02:09:43,000
I can't believe Logan

3341
02:09:43,000 --> 02:09:45,000
just did a great impression of that

3342
02:09:45,000 --> 02:09:47,000
we do impressions

3343
02:09:47,000 --> 02:09:49,000
of that woman all the time

3344
02:09:49,000 --> 02:09:51,000
especially when we see people like this

3345
02:09:51,000 --> 02:09:53,000
and we were doing that too, like while she was talking

3346
02:09:53,000 --> 02:09:55,000
and I was like

3347
02:09:55,000 --> 02:09:57,000
and yeah, and then we had Miley Cyrus follow us

3348
02:09:57,000 --> 02:09:59,000
and we were like making fun of her the entire day

3349
02:09:59,000 --> 02:10:01,000
and Miley Cyrus followed us, right?

3350
02:10:01,000 --> 02:10:03,000
and she was playing music for us

3351
02:10:03,000 --> 02:10:05,000
and then, uh

3352
02:10:05,000 --> 02:10:07,000
then we went to our house on the moon

3353
02:10:07,000 --> 02:10:09,000
and Miley Cyrus followed us

3354
02:10:09,000 --> 02:10:11,000
because she's our slave

3355
02:10:11,000 --> 02:10:13,000
so yeah

3356
02:10:13,000 --> 02:10:15,000
I hate people who have served better

3357
02:10:15,000 --> 02:10:17,000
oh god

3358
02:10:17,000 --> 02:10:19,000
I can't follow that up, that's amazing

3359
02:10:19,000 --> 02:10:21,000
um, I guess my only F.U. would

3360
02:10:21,000 --> 02:10:23,000
go to stress

3361
02:10:23,000 --> 02:10:25,000
because I have quite a lot of it at work right now

3362
02:10:25,000 --> 02:10:27,000
but, you know, it happens

3363
02:10:27,000 --> 02:10:29,000
and F.U. did the fact that I haven't updated

3364
02:10:29,000 --> 02:10:31,000
LiveJournal in like three weeks

3365
02:10:31,000 --> 02:10:33,000
like I'm seriously falling behind on that stuff

3366
02:10:33,000 --> 02:10:35,000
and uh, yeah

3367
02:10:35,000 --> 02:10:37,000
I don't like feeling behind

3368
02:10:37,000 --> 02:10:39,000
on my life

3369
02:10:39,000 --> 02:10:41,000
Kristen Wiig, that's, oh yeah, she's

3370
02:10:41,000 --> 02:10:43,000
like the only woman on that show right now, isn't she?

3371
02:10:43,000 --> 02:10:45,000
Did they ever fire the one that dropped

3372
02:10:45,000 --> 02:10:47,000
the F-bomb on air?

3373
02:10:47,000 --> 02:10:49,000
Who was that? Some new chick

3374
02:10:49,000 --> 02:10:51,000
remember like her first show, like she dropped

3375
02:10:51,000 --> 02:10:53,000
the F-bomb because they gave her a character

3376
02:10:53,000 --> 02:10:55,000
that said frickin' frickin' frickin' every other word

3377
02:10:55,000 --> 02:10:57,000
and one time she just slipped and said, fuck it

3378
02:10:57,000 --> 02:10:59,000
I would have done the same thing

3379
02:10:59,000 --> 02:11:01,000
I kind of felt bad for her

3380
02:11:01,000 --> 02:11:03,000
so, anyhow

3381
02:11:03,000 --> 02:11:05,000
in Reddertainment we like to point out the name of that character is

3382
02:11:05,000 --> 02:11:07,000
Penelope, the one-upper

3383
02:11:07,000 --> 02:11:09,000
there you go

3384
02:11:09,000 --> 02:11:11,000
and the name bless you to Jamie because they can all hear her nose

3385
02:11:11,000 --> 02:11:13,000
sorry!

3386
02:11:13,000 --> 02:11:15,000
Thank you everybody, I love you

3387
02:11:15,000 --> 02:11:17,000
alright, couple more news stories for you guys

3388
02:11:17,000 --> 02:11:19,000
then the Skype line at 1877-GAME-OLR

3389
02:11:19,000 --> 02:11:21,000
Loki?

3390
02:11:21,000 --> 02:11:23,000
Yes, so um

3391
02:11:23,000 --> 02:11:25,000
personally, I haven't played this game yet

3392
02:11:25,000 --> 02:11:27,000
I acquired it for my MAME cabinet

3393
02:11:27,000 --> 02:11:29,000
earlier today, but the game is

3394
02:11:29,000 --> 02:11:31,000
Toki, it's a

3395
02:11:31,000 --> 02:11:33,000
2D side-scrolling game starring a

3396
02:11:33,000 --> 02:11:35,000
ape, and apparently

3397
02:11:35,000 --> 02:11:37,000
it's getting the HD treatment

3398
02:11:37,000 --> 02:11:39,000
the French developer

3399
02:11:39,000 --> 02:11:41,000
Golgoth Studio

3400
02:11:41,000 --> 02:11:43,000
is taking the game and completely redoing all the graphics

3401
02:11:43,000 --> 02:11:45,000
and it actually looks pretty cool

3402
02:11:45,000 --> 02:11:47,000
so I hope the game is fun

3403
02:11:47,000 --> 02:11:49,000
but it looks like it's all

3404
02:11:49,000 --> 02:11:51,000
hand-drawn now and

3405
02:11:51,000 --> 02:11:53,000
I don't know, it's the stuff you would normally

3406
02:11:53,000 --> 02:11:55,000
expect on box art

3407
02:11:55,000 --> 02:11:57,000
but

3408
02:11:57,000 --> 02:11:59,000
it's all in motion now

3409
02:11:59,000 --> 02:12:01,000
huh

3410
02:12:01,000 --> 02:12:03,000
but apparently it'll be coming out for games for Windows Live

3411
02:12:03,000 --> 02:12:05,000
and Xbox Live Arcade

3412
02:12:05,000 --> 02:12:07,000
so it's not like a

3413
02:12:07,000 --> 02:12:09,000
full retail game, it's kind of more of a

3414
02:12:09,000 --> 02:12:11,000
mini-game if it's coming out on Arcade, but it

3415
02:12:11,000 --> 02:12:13,000
looked kind of neat from the screen

3416
02:12:13,000 --> 02:12:15,000
it could still be a full game, yeah

3417
02:12:15,000 --> 02:12:17,000
it looks neat

3418
02:12:17,000 --> 02:12:19,000
interesting

3419
02:12:19,000 --> 02:12:21,000
well, here's some games that didn't do so great when they

3420
02:12:21,000 --> 02:12:23,000
came out, this story kind of caught our attention

3421
02:12:23,000 --> 02:12:25,000
and I don't like a whole lot of these

3422
02:12:25,000 --> 02:12:27,000
top 10 kind of lists, but this particular piece

3423
02:12:27,000 --> 02:12:29,000
on GamesRadar.com, I thought was kind of

3424
02:12:29,000 --> 02:12:31,000
interesting, they ran a piece earlier this week called

3425
02:12:31,000 --> 02:12:33,000
18 Awesome Games That Died at Retail

3426
02:12:33,000 --> 02:12:35,000
and what I thought about reading this

3427
02:12:35,000 --> 02:12:37,000
list is I wanted to see how many of these

3428
02:12:37,000 --> 02:12:39,000
games, Jamie being the collector of

3429
02:12:39,000 --> 02:12:41,000
obscure ass video games, was going to pipe up

3430
02:12:41,000 --> 02:12:43,000
and say, that game was awesome

3431
02:12:43,000 --> 02:12:45,000
so we'll see what happens, so Jamie

3432
02:12:45,000 --> 02:12:47,000
would you like to hear about the 18 awesome

3433
02:12:47,000 --> 02:12:49,000
games that died at retail? Sure

3434
02:12:49,000 --> 02:12:51,000
okay, the first one was Metal Arms

3435
02:12:51,000 --> 02:12:53,000
Glitch in the System, and they

3436
02:12:53,000 --> 02:12:55,000
say this game didn't do too well just

3437
02:12:55,000 --> 02:12:57,000
because it was too kitty for serious

3438
02:12:57,000 --> 02:12:59,000
gamers and vice versa

3439
02:12:59,000 --> 02:13:01,000
Beyond Good and Evil on

3440
02:13:01,000 --> 02:13:03,000
the Playstation 2. I think

3441
02:13:03,000 --> 02:13:05,000
I have that. That's

3442
02:13:05,000 --> 02:13:07,000
one of those big games on GameTap I think

3443
02:13:07,000 --> 02:13:09,000
they were really selling that when that first came out

3444
02:13:09,000 --> 02:13:11,000
again, this is a list from GamesRadar, 18

3445
02:13:11,000 --> 02:13:13,000
games that died at retail

3446
02:13:13,000 --> 02:13:15,000
Grand Theft Auto Chinatown War is a

3447
02:13:15,000 --> 02:13:17,000
more recent game coming out because

3448
02:13:17,000 --> 02:13:19,000
folks saying there's not enough mature games

3449
02:13:19,000 --> 02:13:21,000
for the system, but at the same time

3450
02:13:21,000 --> 02:13:23,000
not enough Nintendo fans wanting mature games

3451
02:13:23,000 --> 02:13:25,000
Why did this die, Loki?

3452
02:13:25,000 --> 02:13:27,000
I didn't really

3453
02:13:27,000 --> 02:13:29,000
care to, you know, I didn't like

3454
02:13:29,000 --> 02:13:31,000
the way it played just because it was a top

3455
02:13:31,000 --> 02:13:33,000
down game

3456
02:13:33,000 --> 02:13:35,000
I prefer more of like the

3457
02:13:35,000 --> 02:13:37,000
PSP versions and stuff that are

3458
02:13:37,000 --> 02:13:39,000
more of the 3D stuff you would see on

3459
02:13:39,000 --> 02:13:41,000
Playstation 2. I understand why they did it that way

3460
02:13:41,000 --> 02:13:43,000
because the

3461
02:13:43,000 --> 02:13:45,000
system might not be able to handle that

3462
02:13:45,000 --> 02:13:47,000
However, now we see that

3463
02:13:47,000 --> 02:13:49,000
Cop of the Recruit is coming

3464
02:13:49,000 --> 02:13:51,000
out from Ubisoft and looks like

3465
02:13:51,000 --> 02:13:53,000
what the Playstation

3466
02:13:53,000 --> 02:13:55,000
portable versions of Grand Theft Auto were

3467
02:13:55,000 --> 02:13:57,000
so it is possible to do

3468
02:13:57,000 --> 02:13:59,000
it that way, but they decided not to

3469
02:13:59,000 --> 02:14:01,000
I think it will have a better

3470
02:14:01,000 --> 02:14:03,000
chance on the PSP probably

3471
02:14:03,000 --> 02:14:05,000
Moving on with the list from GamesRadar.com

3472
02:14:05,000 --> 02:14:07,000
Psychonauts, of course

3473
02:14:07,000 --> 02:14:09,000
I'm sure a list like this just wouldn't be complete without

3474
02:14:09,000 --> 02:14:11,000
Psychonauts. It gets a lot of

3475
02:14:11,000 --> 02:14:13,000
praise all around. It was something that was

3476
02:14:13,000 --> 02:14:15,000
originally supposed to be an exclusive for Microsoft

3477
02:14:15,000 --> 02:14:17,000
but then got killed and brought back and just

3478
02:14:17,000 --> 02:14:19,000
didn't really have a serious marketing push behind it

3479
02:14:19,000 --> 02:14:21,000
I know Jamie will get behind

3480
02:14:21,000 --> 02:14:23,000
this one, Jet Grind Radio on the Dreamcast

3481
02:14:23,000 --> 02:14:25,000
one of the 18

3482
02:14:25,000 --> 02:14:27,000
games that tanked here. Unfortunately

3483
02:14:27,000 --> 02:14:29,000
just being the fact that it was on the Dreamcast

3484
02:14:29,000 --> 02:14:31,000
console

3485
02:14:31,000 --> 02:14:33,000
kind of

3486
02:14:33,000 --> 02:14:35,000
put a damper in it there

3487
02:14:35,000 --> 02:14:37,000
Metal Storm

3488
02:14:37,000 --> 02:14:39,000
is on this list. This is an

3489
02:14:39,000 --> 02:14:41,000
old ass NES side scrolling

3490
02:14:41,000 --> 02:14:43,000
game like on the old school 8-bit

3491
02:14:43,000 --> 02:14:45,000
That was pretty sweet too

3492
02:14:45,000 --> 02:14:47,000
But unfortunately it didn't really

3493
02:14:47,000 --> 02:14:49,000
sell very well. They're saying

3494
02:14:49,000 --> 02:14:51,000
it might have something to do with the fact that it was a

3495
02:14:51,000 --> 02:14:53,000
crappy localization process and

3496
02:14:53,000 --> 02:14:55,000
the cutscenes were taken out when it was brought

3497
02:14:55,000 --> 02:14:57,000
over and it screwed with the color palette

3498
02:14:57,000 --> 02:14:59,000
Shenmue 2

3499
02:14:59,000 --> 02:15:01,000
on the Xbox

3500
02:15:01,000 --> 02:15:03,000
I think I have that somewhere

3501
02:15:03,000 --> 02:15:05,000
Unfortunately this series just kind of

3502
02:15:05,000 --> 02:15:07,000
never really seemed to catch on. It's one of those things

3503
02:15:07,000 --> 02:15:09,000
that went later on

3504
02:15:09,000 --> 02:15:11,000
kind of as a cult status

3505
02:15:13,000 --> 02:15:15,000
Moving on with this list again from

3506
02:15:15,000 --> 02:15:17,000
GamesRadar.com. 18 awesome

3507
02:15:17,000 --> 02:15:19,000
games that died at retail

3508
02:15:19,000 --> 02:15:21,000
Anything you guys would put on this list that you haven't

3509
02:15:21,000 --> 02:15:23,000
heard yet? While I'm waiting for the next page

3510
02:15:23,000 --> 02:15:25,000
to load here

3511
02:15:25,000 --> 02:15:27,000
Earth Defense Force

3512
02:15:27,000 --> 02:15:29,000
Oddworld

3513
02:15:29,000 --> 02:15:31,000
Stranger's Wrath on the

3514
02:15:31,000 --> 02:15:33,000
Xbox is on the list

3515
02:15:33,000 --> 02:15:35,000
Armed and Dangerous for the PC

3516
02:15:35,000 --> 02:15:37,000
Otogi 2

3517
02:15:37,000 --> 02:15:39,000
Immortal Warriors. I never even heard of

3518
02:15:39,000 --> 02:15:41,000
this game but it was a Japanese

3519
02:15:41,000 --> 02:15:43,000
hack and slasher about an ancient swordsman

3520
02:15:43,000 --> 02:15:45,000
It was a sequel

3521
02:15:45,000 --> 02:15:47,000
to a game that apparently didn't do too well in the

3522
02:15:47,000 --> 02:15:49,000
first place. Space Station

3523
02:15:49,000 --> 02:15:51,000
Silicon Valley on the N64

3524
02:15:51,000 --> 02:15:53,000
It was kind of a whimsical little

3525
02:15:53,000 --> 02:15:55,000
platformer robot animal type of game

3526
02:15:55,000 --> 02:15:57,000
that just got lost in the whole

3527
02:15:57,000 --> 02:15:59,000
N64 not being one of

3528
02:15:59,000 --> 02:16:01,000
Nintendo's greatest systems

3529
02:16:01,000 --> 02:16:03,000
Panzer Dragoon Orta

3530
02:16:03,000 --> 02:16:05,000
from 2003 is on the list

3531
02:16:05,000 --> 02:16:07,000
That was a good game

3532
02:16:07,000 --> 02:16:09,000
The Last Express

3533
02:16:09,000 --> 02:16:11,000
That was kind of like a stylish

3534
02:16:11,000 --> 02:16:13,000
game. I remember this game Thief Deadly

3535
02:16:13,000 --> 02:16:15,000
Shadows on the Xbox

3536
02:16:15,000 --> 02:16:17,000
did not do too well. I guess maybe that was

3537
02:16:17,000 --> 02:16:19,000
more of a PC game. I'm not sure

3538
02:16:19,000 --> 02:16:21,000
Jet Set Radio Future

3539
02:16:21,000 --> 02:16:23,000
also made the list

3540
02:16:23,000 --> 02:16:25,000
They say it kind of

3541
02:16:25,000 --> 02:16:27,000
alienated fans of the first game

3542
02:16:27,000 --> 02:16:29,000
Bionic Commando on the

3543
02:16:29,000 --> 02:16:31,000
360 and PS3 I don't think did very well

3544
02:16:31,000 --> 02:16:33,000
Interesting all things considered

3545
02:16:33,000 --> 02:16:35,000
Do you think maybe

3546
02:16:35,000 --> 02:16:37,000
I wonder if the 2D one did better than that

3547
02:16:37,000 --> 02:16:39,000
Yeah it did a lot better

3548
02:16:39,000 --> 02:16:41,000
I think because the game kind of

3549
02:16:41,000 --> 02:16:43,000
I think people were just tied to their memories of the old school

3550
02:16:43,000 --> 02:16:45,000
game and weren't ready for the whole 3D-ification

3551
02:16:45,000 --> 02:16:47,000
of it, you know

3552
02:16:47,000 --> 02:16:49,000
Yeah, there might have been issues with the game

3553
02:16:49,000 --> 02:16:51,000
Grim Fandango

3554
02:16:51,000 --> 02:16:53,000
also on the list, getting down towards

3555
02:16:53,000 --> 02:16:55,000
the end here. The Neverhood

3556
02:16:55,000 --> 02:16:57,000
from 1996 on the list

3557
02:16:57,000 --> 02:16:59,000
and last but not least

3558
02:16:59,000 --> 02:17:01,000
Okami made the list which isn't

3559
02:17:01,000 --> 02:17:03,000
surprising at all and the reason why

3560
02:17:03,000 --> 02:17:05,000
Okami kind of got burned, it was out on the

3561
02:17:05,000 --> 02:17:07,000
Playstation 2 kind of when the next generation

3562
02:17:07,000 --> 02:17:09,000
of games was already starting and the

3563
02:17:09,000 --> 02:17:11,000
PS2 was already dying out for a lot of hardcore

3564
02:17:11,000 --> 02:17:13,000
gamers. I think that was one of the biggest problems with Final Fantasy

3565
02:17:13,000 --> 02:17:15,000
12, I think it came out too late

3566
02:17:15,000 --> 02:17:17,000
I think by the time Final Fantasy 12 came out

3567
02:17:17,000 --> 02:17:19,000
it should have been on the next gen system

3568
02:17:19,000 --> 02:17:21,000
But that's just me

3569
02:17:21,000 --> 02:17:23,000
So, alright

3570
02:17:23,000 --> 02:17:25,000
I guess we're getting to that part of the

3571
02:17:25,000 --> 02:17:27,000
show where we're going to open up the Skype line

3572
02:17:27,000 --> 02:17:29,000
and hear from you guys

3573
02:17:29,000 --> 02:17:31,000
1-877-GAME-OLR is the number you want

3574
02:17:31,000 --> 02:17:33,000
to call if you want to get on the show or you can just

3575
02:17:33,000 --> 02:17:35,000
Skype us directly at Orange Lounge Radio

3576
02:17:35,000 --> 02:17:37,000
I do want to give a little disclaimer first, we've been having

3577
02:17:37,000 --> 02:17:39,000
problems with Skype the past couple weeks

3578
02:17:39,000 --> 02:17:41,000
where we've been randomly hanging up on callers

3579
02:17:41,000 --> 02:17:43,000
We did upgrade to a new version of Skype

3580
02:17:43,000 --> 02:17:45,000
today, so

3581
02:17:45,000 --> 02:17:47,000
we're on the latest and greatest version of Skype

3582
02:17:47,000 --> 02:17:49,000
I'm hoping that we'll fix our problems

3583
02:17:49,000 --> 02:17:51,000
We hadn't upgraded in a long time

3584
02:17:51,000 --> 02:17:53,000
I'm hoping that we'll fix our problems, but we don't

3585
02:17:53,000 --> 02:17:55,000
know what's going to happen, we still may have

3586
02:17:55,000 --> 02:17:57,000
some issues tonight, so bear with us

3587
02:17:57,000 --> 02:17:59,000
But again, the number 1-877-GAME-OLR

3588
02:17:59,000 --> 02:18:01,000
if you want to give us a call

3589
02:18:01,000 --> 02:18:03,000
Meanwhile, do we have any last minute stories we want to get to

3590
02:18:03,000 --> 02:18:05,000
while we wait for some calls?

3591
02:18:05,000 --> 02:18:07,000
Sure, we'll talk about a game called Inversion

3592
02:18:07,000 --> 02:18:09,000
which actually looks pretty sweet

3593
02:18:09,000 --> 02:18:11,000
and of course, the developer

3594
02:18:11,000 --> 02:18:13,000
of Timeshift, Saber Interactive

3595
02:18:13,000 --> 02:18:15,000
they're doing a new shooter

3596
02:18:15,000 --> 02:18:17,000
that kind of takes place during

3597
02:18:17,000 --> 02:18:19,000
an invasion by aliens called

3598
02:18:19,000 --> 02:18:21,000
Ludador, and what happens

3599
02:18:21,000 --> 02:18:23,000
they have these anti-gravity

3600
02:18:23,000 --> 02:18:25,000
bubbles, they're calling them

3601
02:18:25,000 --> 02:18:27,000
gravitational vectors

3602
02:18:27,000 --> 02:18:29,000
that appear in the game, changing the gravity

3603
02:18:29,000 --> 02:18:31,000
in different directions and also

3604
02:18:31,000 --> 02:18:33,000
becomes part of the game where you can flip stuff

3605
02:18:33,000 --> 02:18:35,000
upside down and whatnot

3606
02:18:35,000 --> 02:18:37,000
It's kind of cool, and they have a new weapon

3607
02:18:37,000 --> 02:18:39,000
in the game called a grappler that allows you to

3608
02:18:39,000 --> 02:18:41,000
manipulate gravity as well and move objects

3609
02:18:41,000 --> 02:18:43,000
around stuff, so that's kind of cool

3610
02:18:43,000 --> 02:18:45,000
and it looks like that'll be due out on the

3611
02:18:45,000 --> 02:18:47,000
Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 in

3612
02:18:47,000 --> 02:18:49,000
2010

3613
02:18:49,000 --> 02:18:51,000
Let's go to the phones and take a call

3614
02:18:51,000 --> 02:18:53,000
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?

3615
02:18:55,000 --> 02:18:57,000
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?

3616
02:18:59,000 --> 02:19:01,000
Hola, bienvenidos a Orange

3617
02:19:01,000 --> 02:19:03,000
Launch Radio, quien es?

3618
02:19:03,000 --> 02:19:05,000
Remember

3619
02:19:05,000 --> 02:19:07,000
you should always check your microphone

3620
02:19:07,000 --> 02:19:09,000
connection calling

3621
02:19:09,000 --> 02:19:11,000
Echo 123 on Skype

3622
02:19:11,000 --> 02:19:13,000
before you give us a call, otherwise

3623
02:19:13,000 --> 02:19:15,000
it may not work, but I could swear I heard somebody

3624
02:19:15,000 --> 02:19:17,000
breathing there, maybe they just couldn't hear us for some reason

3625
02:19:17,000 --> 02:19:19,000
I did, I heard someone breathing

3626
02:19:19,000 --> 02:19:21,000
I could too, so I don't know what the hell was going on there

3627
02:19:21,000 --> 02:19:23,000
So somebody was not paying attention

3628
02:19:23,000 --> 02:19:25,000
Don't know

3629
02:19:25,000 --> 02:19:27,000
what happened there

3630
02:19:27,000 --> 02:19:29,000
Do we have any other, well actually

3631
02:19:29,000 --> 02:19:31,000
here we go, we got another call coming in

3632
02:19:31,000 --> 02:19:33,000
Orange Launch Radio, who's this?

3633
02:19:33,000 --> 02:19:35,000
Hey, it's SSJ100 Matt

3634
02:19:35,000 --> 02:19:37,000
Hey SSJ100 Matt, how are you?

3635
02:19:39,000 --> 02:19:41,000
I'm doing good, quite a while

3636
02:19:41,000 --> 02:19:43,000
You're cutting out a little bit

3637
02:19:43,000 --> 02:19:45,000
I don't know what's going on, but what are you

3638
02:19:45,000 --> 02:19:47,000
up to tonight?

3639
02:19:47,000 --> 02:19:49,000
I've actually just got out of

3640
02:19:49,000 --> 02:19:51,000
Video Games Live

3641
02:19:51,000 --> 02:19:53,000
Video Games Live,

3642
02:19:53,000 --> 02:19:55,000
was it in New York City tonight?

3643
02:19:55,000 --> 02:19:57,000
It was

3644
02:19:57,000 --> 02:19:59,000
How was the show?

3645
02:19:59,000 --> 02:20:01,000
It was great, you know

3646
02:20:01,000 --> 02:20:03,000
I went to other shows

3647
02:20:03,000 --> 02:20:05,000
before, you know, I went to the Dear Friends concert

3648
02:20:05,000 --> 02:20:07,000
a while back when it was done around

3649
02:20:07,000 --> 02:20:09,000
and this was

3650
02:20:09,000 --> 02:20:11,000
you know, a lot more

3651
02:20:11,000 --> 02:20:13,000
this is a lot better

3652
02:20:13,000 --> 02:20:15,000
Well, was this your first Video Games Live

3653
02:20:15,000 --> 02:20:17,000
that you've been to?

3654
02:20:17,000 --> 02:20:19,000
This is the first one I've been to

3655
02:20:19,000 --> 02:20:21,000
What was kind of the highlight of the show

3656
02:20:21,000 --> 02:20:23,000
for you, you think?

3657
02:20:23,000 --> 02:20:25,000
Well

3658
02:20:25,000 --> 02:20:27,000
I think the best

3659
02:20:27,000 --> 02:20:29,000
was when he did the encore

3660
02:20:29,000 --> 02:20:31,000
it was Chrono Trigger

3661
02:20:31,000 --> 02:20:33,000
Because it was kind of

3662
02:20:33,000 --> 02:20:35,000
you know, he thought he wasn't going to be playing it

3663
02:20:35,000 --> 02:20:37,000
and then he came out

3664
02:20:37,000 --> 02:20:39,000
said this was the number one requested song

3665
02:20:39,000 --> 02:20:41,000
the piece that everyone

3666
02:20:41,000 --> 02:20:43,000
wanted to Video Games Live

3667
02:20:43,000 --> 02:20:45,000
And I just want to point out

3668
02:20:45,000 --> 02:20:47,000
we realize SSJ100 Matt

3669
02:20:47,000 --> 02:20:49,000
is breaking up, his connection

3670
02:20:49,000 --> 02:20:51,000
is kind of crap, I don't know if that's because of the new

3671
02:20:51,000 --> 02:20:53,000
Skype or what's going on, but we're going to try

3672
02:20:53,000 --> 02:20:55,000
and get through this because I want to talk about

3673
02:20:55,000 --> 02:20:57,000
Video Games Live a little bit. The Chrono Trigger piece

3674
02:20:57,000 --> 02:20:59,000
we were there

3675
02:20:59,000 --> 02:21:01,000
the night that debuted in Oakland

3676
02:21:01,000 --> 02:21:03,000
that was an awesome night, so a good piece

3677
02:21:03,000 --> 02:21:05,000
I'm glad that came out

3678
02:21:05,000 --> 02:21:07,000
Any lowlights?

3679
02:21:07,000 --> 02:21:09,000
Were there songs that they were playing

3680
02:21:09,000 --> 02:21:11,000
where you were kind of like, they could have bumped

3681
02:21:11,000 --> 02:21:13,000
this for something else?

3682
02:21:13,000 --> 02:21:17,000
Not really, I mean

3683
02:21:17,000 --> 02:21:19,000
I was

3684
02:21:19,000 --> 02:21:21,000
it was cool that they bought

3685
02:21:21,000 --> 02:21:23,000
Mega Man, which I don't think

3686
02:21:23,000 --> 02:21:25,000
they bought

3687
02:21:25,000 --> 02:21:27,000
in previous video shows

3688
02:21:27,000 --> 02:21:29,000
but

3689
02:21:29,000 --> 02:21:31,000
the note did change

3690
02:21:31,000 --> 02:21:33,000
they did play

3691
02:21:33,000 --> 02:21:35,000
Castlevania songs

3692
02:21:35,000 --> 02:21:37,000
Ah, Castlevania

3693
02:21:37,000 --> 02:21:39,000
Did they have any guests show up?

3694
02:21:39,000 --> 02:21:41,000
Because sometimes they have random guests show up at these things

3695
02:21:41,000 --> 02:21:43,000
Well they did have

3696
02:21:43,000 --> 02:21:45,000
a kid from YouTube

3697
02:21:45,000 --> 02:21:47,000
that played

3698
02:21:47,000 --> 02:21:49,000
Mario songs blindfolded

3699
02:21:49,000 --> 02:21:51,000
Oh, on the piano?

3700
02:21:51,000 --> 02:21:53,000
Yeah, I think Tommy

3701
02:21:53,000 --> 02:21:55,000
has him on the payroll or something

3702
02:21:55,000 --> 02:21:57,000
he follows him everywhere

3703
02:21:57,000 --> 02:21:59,000
And also, good show

3704
02:21:59,000 --> 02:22:01,000
they

3705
02:22:01,000 --> 02:22:03,000
called in

3706
02:22:03,000 --> 02:22:05,000
I'm trying to think of the name, Ross Bear

3707
02:22:05,000 --> 02:22:07,000
the creator of Pong

3708
02:22:07,000 --> 02:22:09,000
Oh, nice

3709
02:22:09,000 --> 02:22:11,000
So, that was interesting

3710
02:22:11,000 --> 02:22:13,000
Alright, well as I was showing them out

3711
02:22:13,000 --> 02:22:15,000
we're going to let you go because the connection is kind of

3712
02:22:15,000 --> 02:22:17,000
a bit crap, but thank you so much

3713
02:22:17,000 --> 02:22:19,000
for calling in

3714
02:22:19,000 --> 02:22:21,000
Yeah, I'm actually in

3715
02:22:21,000 --> 02:22:23,000
watching the rest of the Yankee

3716
02:22:23,000 --> 02:22:25,000
show, sorry about that

3717
02:22:25,000 --> 02:22:27,000
Alright, well take care

3718
02:22:27,000 --> 02:22:29,000
and thanks for giving us a call

3719
02:22:29,000 --> 02:22:31,000
and it's good to hear that the show is still going

3720
02:22:31,000 --> 02:22:33,000
and traveling across the nation. Take care, buddy

3721
02:22:35,000 --> 02:22:37,000
Alright

3722
02:22:37,000 --> 02:22:39,000
Let's see

3723
02:22:39,000 --> 02:22:41,000
Moving on to more

3724
02:22:41,000 --> 02:22:43,000
calls and more last minute stories

3725
02:22:43,000 --> 02:22:45,000
here on Orange Longest Radio

3726
02:22:45,000 --> 02:22:47,000
I hope that was just an isolated thing

3727
02:22:47,000 --> 02:22:49,000
and not something that's going to continue

3728
02:22:49,000 --> 02:22:51,000
We'll see, hopefully

3729
02:22:51,000 --> 02:22:53,000
He said he was somewhere, I don't know, he was cutting out

3730
02:22:53,000 --> 02:22:55,000
I think he said he was at a game or something, so we'll see

3731
02:22:55,000 --> 02:22:57,000
We'll try to get a couple more calls here

3732
02:22:57,000 --> 02:22:59,000
877-Game-O-L-R

3733
02:22:59,000 --> 02:23:01,000
Loki, do you have any other last minute stories?

3734
02:23:01,000 --> 02:23:03,000
Yeah, DiRT 2 is heading to PC's in December

3735
02:23:03,000 --> 02:23:05,000
It's going to be one of the first games using DirectX 11

3736
02:23:05,000 --> 02:23:07,000
and apparently they were shown off during the big

3737
02:23:07,000 --> 02:23:09,000
Windows 7 launch party in New York City

3738
02:23:11,000 --> 02:23:13,000
Hmm, it's very sexy looking

3739
02:23:13,000 --> 02:23:15,000
Alright, let's go to the phones

3740
02:23:15,000 --> 02:23:17,000
Hi, you're on Orange Longest Radio, who's this?

3741
02:23:17,000 --> 02:23:19,000
This is DS Master 25

3742
02:23:19,000 --> 02:23:21,000
Hi, DS Master 25, what's on your mind?

3743
02:23:23,000 --> 02:23:25,000
Well, kinda

3744
02:23:25,000 --> 02:23:27,000
sad story today

3745
02:23:27,000 --> 02:23:29,000
What's that?

3746
02:23:33,000 --> 02:23:35,000
As soon as I get done

3747
02:23:35,000 --> 02:23:37,000
What the hell is going on?

3748
02:23:37,000 --> 02:23:39,000
Is somebody breaking a dish behind you?

3749
02:23:39,000 --> 02:23:41,000
What is going on?

3750
02:23:41,000 --> 02:23:43,000
My mother

3751
02:23:43,000 --> 02:23:45,000
Basically my DS

3752
02:23:45,000 --> 02:23:47,000
Who are you talking to?

3753
02:23:47,000 --> 02:23:49,000
I'm on the radio, mom

3754
02:23:49,000 --> 02:23:51,000
Come on

3755
02:23:51,000 --> 02:23:53,000
It's 11 o'clock

3756
02:23:53,000 --> 02:23:55,000
Basically

3757
02:23:55,000 --> 02:23:57,000
the L button on my DS side died

3758
02:23:57,000 --> 02:23:59,000
and it's only been like a few months

3759
02:23:59,000 --> 02:24:01,000
and

3760
02:24:01,000 --> 02:24:03,000
I don't know if any of our listeners have had that problem

3761
02:24:05,000 --> 02:24:07,000
Is your mom mad that you're calling in

3762
02:24:07,000 --> 02:24:09,000
so late?

3763
02:24:09,000 --> 02:24:11,000
Probably

3764
02:24:11,000 --> 02:24:13,000
You shouldn't say Jesus in front of your mother like that

3765
02:24:13,000 --> 02:24:15,000
That's usually frowned upon, just so you know

3766
02:24:19,000 --> 02:24:21,000
You realize your whole call has just been shot

3767
02:24:21,000 --> 02:24:23,000
because now everybody's just saying

3768
02:24:23,000 --> 02:24:25,000
Mom, I'm on the radio

3769
02:24:27,000 --> 02:24:29,000
I'm sorry, but

3770
02:24:29,000 --> 02:24:31,000
basically my

3771
02:24:31,000 --> 02:24:33,000
DSi, the stupid L button

3772
02:24:33,000 --> 02:24:35,000
stopped working in the middle of 3D

3773
02:24:35,000 --> 02:24:37,000
pinball

3774
02:24:37,000 --> 02:24:39,000
I'm sorry to hear it

3775
02:24:39,000 --> 02:24:41,000
But mom's not gonna

3776
02:24:41,000 --> 02:24:43,000
buy you a new one if you keep staying up late

3777
02:24:43,000 --> 02:24:45,000
to call stupid internet radio programs

3778
02:24:45,000 --> 02:24:47,000
Well, anyways

3779
02:24:47,000 --> 02:24:49,000
I do have a good game review though

3780
02:24:49,000 --> 02:24:51,000
Kingdom Hearts

3781
02:24:51,000 --> 02:24:53,000
can be on a date over two days

3782
02:24:55,000 --> 02:24:57,000
I will say here

3783
02:24:57,000 --> 02:24:59,000
I've been a long time Square fan

3784
02:24:59,000 --> 02:25:01,000
even though I kinda

3785
02:25:01,000 --> 02:25:03,000
despise them on the first Kingdom Hearts

3786
02:25:03,000 --> 02:25:05,000
because I'm like, what the hell are you thinking

3787
02:25:05,000 --> 02:25:07,000
I'm playing with Disney?

3788
02:25:07,000 --> 02:25:09,000
You're stupid

3789
02:25:09,000 --> 02:25:11,000
Well, you know

3790
02:25:11,000 --> 02:25:13,000
if I'm telling you, don't knock it till you try it

3791
02:25:13,000 --> 02:25:15,000
So, uh, you know

3792
02:25:15,000 --> 02:25:17,000
and I still love the series right then and there

3793
02:25:17,000 --> 02:25:19,000
and

3794
02:25:19,000 --> 02:25:21,000
when Kyrie left

3795
02:25:21,000 --> 02:25:23,000
I kinda cried

3796
02:25:23,000 --> 02:25:25,000
and

3797
02:25:25,000 --> 02:25:27,000
basically now I'm still on the search for

3798
02:25:27,000 --> 02:25:29,000
in this one, which is supposed to be the

3799
02:25:29,000 --> 02:25:31,000
real link between

3800
02:25:31,000 --> 02:25:33,000
one and two

3801
02:25:33,000 --> 02:25:35,000
I was fortunate enough to sell my Playstation 2 op

3802
02:25:35,000 --> 02:25:37,000
because they're overdraft

3803
02:25:37,000 --> 02:25:39,000
but I'm planning on getting one again

3804
02:25:39,000 --> 02:25:41,000
just to play the rest of the Kingdom Hearts series

3805
02:25:41,000 --> 02:25:43,000
again

3806
02:25:43,000 --> 02:25:45,000
Your mom didn't see you crying in a video game

3807
02:25:45,000 --> 02:25:47,000
did she?

3808
02:25:47,000 --> 02:25:49,000
No, my girlfriend did

3809
02:25:49,000 --> 02:25:51,000
though, and she kinda cried along

3810
02:25:51,000 --> 02:25:53,000
because she's like, no Kyrie

3811
02:25:53,000 --> 02:25:55,000
don't leave

3812
02:25:55,000 --> 02:25:57,000
Well that's okay, you know, chicks seeing you cry

3813
02:25:57,000 --> 02:25:59,000
that just scores you points with them

3814
02:25:59,000 --> 02:26:01,000
but you don't want your mom to see you cry because then she thinks you're a wimp

3815
02:26:01,000 --> 02:26:03,000
Alright

3816
02:26:03,000 --> 02:26:05,000
Yeah, I'm posting my father is already

3817
02:26:05,000 --> 02:26:07,000
bashing the whole Hannah Montana

3818
02:26:07,000 --> 02:26:09,000
stuff and saying, at least you're playing good music

3819
02:26:09,000 --> 02:26:11,000
Wait, are you

3820
02:26:11,000 --> 02:26:13,000
a Hannah Montana fan?

3821
02:26:13,000 --> 02:26:15,000
I was the one who sent in

3822
02:26:15,000 --> 02:26:17,000
that angry message, you know

3823
02:26:17,000 --> 02:26:19,000
remember, leave Hannah alone

3824
02:26:19,000 --> 02:26:21,000
Do you guys remember that?

3825
02:26:21,000 --> 02:26:23,000
I try every day to forget

3826
02:26:23,000 --> 02:26:25,000
Episode 271

3827
02:26:25,000 --> 02:26:27,000
I'll go look it up

3828
02:26:27,000 --> 02:26:29,000
I don't remember

3829
02:26:29,000 --> 02:26:31,000
That would have only been like two years ago

3830
02:26:31,000 --> 02:26:33,000
That's alright

3831
02:26:33,000 --> 02:26:35,000
This isn't going to get any better

3832
02:26:35,000 --> 02:26:37,000
DS Master 25 or 26 or whoever you are

3833
02:26:37,000 --> 02:26:39,000
we've got to wrap up, it's way past your bedtime

3834
02:26:39,000 --> 02:26:41,000
young man, but any other last minute thoughts

3835
02:26:41,000 --> 02:26:43,000
before we let you go?

3836
02:26:43,000 --> 02:26:45,000
Beat Mania 2DX 17

3837
02:26:45,000 --> 02:26:47,000
so PS3 is going to rock

3838
02:26:47,000 --> 02:26:49,000
I'm importing it with a PS3

3839
02:26:49,000 --> 02:26:51,000
that's indefinite

3840
02:26:51,000 --> 02:26:53,000
I hope we actually see it over here

3841
02:26:53,000 --> 02:26:55,000
It's perfect

3842
02:26:55,000 --> 02:26:57,000
Later

3843
02:26:57,000 --> 02:26:59,000
Wow

3844
02:26:59,000 --> 02:27:01,000
That's like

3845
02:27:01,000 --> 02:27:03,000
and then

3846
02:27:03,000 --> 02:27:05,000
it got worse

3847
02:27:05,000 --> 02:27:07,000
and then it got worse

3848
02:27:07,000 --> 02:27:09,000
You have to admit that call is pretty epic

3849
02:27:09,000 --> 02:27:11,000
that was pretty awesome

3850
02:27:11,000 --> 02:27:13,000
It was cool, I kind of feel bad for a minute

3851
02:27:13,000 --> 02:27:15,000
that's alright

3852
02:27:15,000 --> 02:27:17,000
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?

3853
02:27:17,000 --> 02:27:19,000
Hello, this is Ray

3854
02:27:19,000 --> 02:27:21,000
or Ray Force

3855
02:27:21,000 --> 02:27:23,000
whatever you go on Orange Lounge Radio

3856
02:27:23,000 --> 02:27:25,000
What's up Ray?

3857
02:27:25,000 --> 02:27:27,000
What's your mind?

3858
02:27:27,000 --> 02:27:29,000
Well, this past week I managed to

3859
02:27:29,000 --> 02:27:31,000
get my hands on a Street Fighter 4

3860
02:27:31,000 --> 02:27:33,000
5 and 6 tournament edition

3861
02:27:33,000 --> 02:27:35,000
it had a big stick with the real arcade parts

3862
02:27:35,000 --> 02:27:37,000
Mhm

3863
02:27:37,000 --> 02:27:39,000
Now what did you think?

3864
02:27:39,000 --> 02:27:41,000
So I started

3865
02:27:41,000 --> 02:27:43,000
I was playing mostly shooter type games

3866
02:27:43,000 --> 02:27:45,000
like

3867
02:27:45,000 --> 02:27:47,000
writing fires and such

3868
02:27:47,000 --> 02:27:49,000
it takes some time getting used to it

3869
02:27:49,000 --> 02:27:51,000
especially with the square well

3870
02:27:51,000 --> 02:27:53,000
instead of having an octagonal well

3871
02:27:53,000 --> 02:27:55,000
I get used to it

3872
02:27:55,000 --> 02:27:57,000
playing a

3873
02:27:57,000 --> 02:27:59,000
tree shooter with a stick

3874
02:27:59,000 --> 02:28:01,000
it's really something you'd play with

3875
02:28:01,000 --> 02:28:03,000
a patterned keyboard

3876
02:28:03,000 --> 02:28:05,000
How expensive is this thing?

3877
02:28:07,000 --> 02:28:09,000
I got it at $95

3878
02:28:09,000 --> 02:28:11,000
at Fry's

3879
02:28:11,000 --> 02:28:13,000
but it was down to $95 instead of $100

3880
02:28:13,000 --> 02:28:15,000
like usual because it was a return

3881
02:28:15,000 --> 02:28:17,000
stick, I guess someone didn't like it

3882
02:28:17,000 --> 02:28:19,000
but said they returned it

3883
02:28:19,000 --> 02:28:21,000
I guess that kind of stuff

3884
02:28:21,000 --> 02:28:23,000
tends to go down in price though

3885
02:28:23,000 --> 02:28:25,000
after just a little bit of time

3886
02:28:25,000 --> 02:28:27,000
because haven't those been out a little while?

3887
02:28:27,000 --> 02:28:29,000
Since February

3888
02:28:29,000 --> 02:28:31,000
Yeah, they've been out for nearly a year now

3889
02:28:31,000 --> 02:28:33,000
and I believe the prices around VR

3890
02:28:33,000 --> 02:28:35,000
are starting to run out of them

3891
02:28:35,000 --> 02:28:37,000
Honestly

3892
02:28:37,000 --> 02:28:39,000
if you're to build your own, it's a lot cheaper

3893
02:28:39,000 --> 02:28:41,000
Really? Because I actually thought about getting one of those

3894
02:28:41,000 --> 02:28:43,000
I think we're thinking of the same

3895
02:28:43,000 --> 02:28:45,000
device, I was thinking about getting one of those

3896
02:28:45,000 --> 02:28:47,000
a while ago

3897
02:28:47,000 --> 02:28:49,000
Yeah, you can basically, if you get the encoder board

3898
02:28:49,000 --> 02:28:51,000
which, they're not that expensive

3899
02:28:51,000 --> 02:28:53,000
the actual

3900
02:28:53,000 --> 02:28:55,000
buttons and everything will cost anything

3901
02:28:55,000 --> 02:28:57,000
I'm not you, I can't build my own stuff

3902
02:28:57,000 --> 02:28:59,000
It plugs in! I mean my god

3903
02:28:59,000 --> 02:29:01,000
It's a switch

3904
02:29:01,000 --> 02:29:03,000
Fine, it's simple

3905
02:29:03,000 --> 02:29:05,000
You'd be surprised

3906
02:29:05,000 --> 02:29:07,000
Be very surprised

3907
02:29:07,000 --> 02:29:09,000
So Ray, was it worth the money?

3908
02:29:09,000 --> 02:29:11,000
No

3909
02:29:11,000 --> 02:29:13,000
Was it worth the money?

3910
02:29:13,000 --> 02:29:15,000
Definitely

3911
02:29:15,000 --> 02:29:17,000
I also love how it's real arcade parts

3912
02:29:17,000 --> 02:29:19,000
so if one of the buttons breaks down

3913
02:29:19,000 --> 02:29:21,000
I can just replace it with actual arcade parts

3914
02:29:23,000 --> 02:29:25,000
What I kind of like about what you're saying is that

3915
02:29:25,000 --> 02:29:27,000
you're not actually using this to play Street Fighter 4

3916
02:29:27,000 --> 02:29:29,000
but that you're using it to play other games

3917
02:29:29,000 --> 02:29:31,000
like shooters and stuff, because I think, seriously

3918
02:29:31,000 --> 02:29:33,000
if I were to get one of these, I'd actually use it to play Soul Calibur

3919
02:29:35,000 --> 02:29:37,000
Well, I suck horribly at fighters

3920
02:29:37,000 --> 02:29:39,000
I mean, I'm a snot person first

3921
02:29:39,000 --> 02:29:41,000
and a fighting game person

3922
02:29:41,000 --> 02:29:47,000
I'm like, way further down

3923
02:29:47,000 --> 02:29:49,000
I don't think it's worth it

3924
02:29:49,000 --> 02:29:51,000
Alright

3925
02:29:51,000 --> 02:29:53,000
Well, Buddy, do you have anything else you want to talk about tonight?

3926
02:29:53,000 --> 02:29:55,000
Any other games you've been playing lately?

3927
02:29:55,000 --> 02:29:57,000
I'm playing Space Invaders Extreme 2

3928
02:29:57,000 --> 02:29:59,000
but I haven't been playing it for long

3929
02:29:59,000 --> 02:30:01,000
so I'll probably tell him about it next week

3930
02:30:01,000 --> 02:30:03,000
Yeah, please do, I'm very curious to hear about that game

3931
02:30:03,000 --> 02:30:05,000
because I did enjoy the first one

3932
02:30:05,000 --> 02:30:07,000
I want to hear about what's new in the second one

3933
02:30:07,000 --> 02:30:09,000
You know

3934
02:30:09,000 --> 02:30:11,000
How about later when there's more time to talk

3935
02:30:11,000 --> 02:30:15,000
I used to most of my call this time on the arcade stage

3936
02:30:15,000 --> 02:30:17,000
so a lot of people can't be called

3937
02:30:17,000 --> 02:30:19,000
We'll arrange something

3938
02:30:19,000 --> 02:30:21,000
Okay

3939
02:30:21,000 --> 02:30:23,000
Alright, take care, Buddy

3940
02:30:23,000 --> 02:30:25,000
Hey, you're in the Bay Area, any chance we're going to see you at UmLoud?

3941
02:30:25,000 --> 02:30:29,000
I'm not sure

3942
02:30:29,000 --> 02:30:33,000
If on a Wednesday, I'm not sure if I'll be able to make it since on Thursdays

3943
02:30:33,000 --> 02:30:35,000
that's class Sunday at 9am

3944
02:30:35,000 --> 02:30:37,000
and that's in San Jose, not San Francisco

3945
02:30:37,000 --> 02:30:39,000
Oh yeah, that's right, you're in the South Bay

3946
02:30:39,000 --> 02:30:41,000
Well, we'll see

3947
02:30:41,000 --> 02:30:43,000
It is a weeknight, that's tough

3948
02:30:43,000 --> 02:30:45,000
but hopefully we'll see some of our Bay Area friends

3949
02:30:45,000 --> 02:30:47,000
able to get up there

3950
02:30:47,000 --> 02:30:49,000
so it's going to be a fun night

3951
02:30:49,000 --> 02:30:51,000
Alright, Buddy, thanks for calling

3952
02:30:51,000 --> 02:30:53,000
Alright, see you later

3953
02:30:53,000 --> 02:30:55,000
Speaking of San Jose, we've got to get our butts back to Fonomay next year

3954
02:30:55,000 --> 02:30:57,000
because we missed this year

3955
02:30:57,000 --> 02:30:59,000
I had a fun time at that convention

3956
02:30:59,000 --> 02:31:01,000
We've got to get back there

3957
02:31:01,000 --> 02:31:03,000
Anyhow, I guess that's going to do it for the Skype line tonight

3958
02:31:03,000 --> 02:31:05,000
Thank you for those folks that gave us a call

3959
02:31:05,000 --> 02:31:07,000
We hope you missed your chance tonight

3960
02:31:07,000 --> 02:31:09,000
You can always try again next week

3961
02:31:09,000 --> 02:31:11,000
But we are going to first check in

3962
02:31:11,000 --> 02:31:13,000
see if there's any other last minute stories

3963
02:31:13,000 --> 02:31:15,000
and wrap up the show

3964
02:31:15,000 --> 02:31:17,000
Just real quick, there's a new indie game that's on Xbox Live indie games

3965
02:31:17,000 --> 02:31:19,000
called Pumpkin Shop

3966
02:31:19,000 --> 02:31:21,000
and yes, this will be the perfect time of the year

3967
02:31:21,000 --> 02:31:23,000
to release a pumpkin carving sim

3968
02:31:23,000 --> 02:31:25,000
so you can do just that without the mess

3969
02:31:25,000 --> 02:31:27,000
and have your own virtual pumpkin

3970
02:31:27,000 --> 02:31:29,000
that no one can smash against your porch

3971
02:31:29,000 --> 02:31:31,000
No word on how expensive that is

3972
02:31:31,000 --> 02:31:33,000
but that is called Pumpkin Shop

3973
02:31:33,000 --> 02:31:35,000
Sounds a little ridiculous to me

3974
02:31:35,000 --> 02:31:37,000
It looks neat

3975
02:31:37,000 --> 02:31:39,000
It'd be cool if you could share it with your friends

3976
02:31:39,000 --> 02:31:41,000
If you want to carve a pumpkin, carve a pumpkin

3977
02:31:41,000 --> 02:31:43,000
I'm surprised there's not a Facebook app to do that

3978
02:31:43,000 --> 02:31:45,000
and then you share it with your friends

3979
02:31:45,000 --> 02:31:47,000
so they get annoying little notices and stuff

3980
02:31:47,000 --> 02:31:49,000
Yeah, I'm kind of surprised there isn't that too

3981
02:31:49,000 --> 02:31:51,000
but now that you said it, there'll probably be one

3982
02:31:51,000 --> 02:31:53,000
Is that it?

3983
02:31:53,000 --> 02:31:55,000
It's a shame that there's not millions of dollars

3984
02:31:55,000 --> 02:31:57,000
coming into my mailbox each day

3985
02:31:57,000 --> 02:31:59,000
because that would be tragic

3986
02:31:59,000 --> 02:32:01,000
I know, you can start your own game company

3987
02:32:01,000 --> 02:32:03,000
with a pumpkin carving Facebook app

3988
02:32:03,000 --> 02:32:05,000
release President Cat

3989
02:32:05,000 --> 02:32:07,000
You'd be a rich man

3990
02:32:07,000 --> 02:32:09,000
We'll see what we can do with President Cat

3991
02:32:09,000 --> 02:32:11,000
I mean, it's just a matter of giving

3992
02:32:11,000 --> 02:32:13,000
That sounds like a threat

3993
02:32:13,000 --> 02:32:15,000
That's not a threat

3994
02:32:15,000 --> 02:32:17,000
We'll just see where we can

3995
02:32:17,000 --> 02:32:19,000
We'll figure out who we want to target

3996
02:32:19,000 --> 02:32:21,000
to bug about releasing President Cat

3997
02:32:21,000 --> 02:32:23,000
over here and

3998
02:32:23,000 --> 02:32:25,000
I think access game localization

3999
02:32:25,000 --> 02:32:27,000
I know, I was going to say, whoever's doing Choaniki

4000
02:32:27,000 --> 02:32:29,000
I mean, really, really

4001
02:32:29,000 --> 02:32:31,000
They

4002
02:32:31,000 --> 02:32:33,000
What did they release?

4003
02:32:33,000 --> 02:32:35,000
They don't release that many games a year

4004
02:32:35,000 --> 02:32:37,000
so I think that they may have

4005
02:32:37,000 --> 02:32:39,000
their budget might be really low

4006
02:32:39,000 --> 02:32:41,000
I'd say both them and UFO Interactive

4007
02:32:41,000 --> 02:32:43,000
would be good candidates

4008
02:32:43,000 --> 02:32:45,000
to bug about

4009
02:32:45,000 --> 02:32:47,000
releasing the game over here

4010
02:32:47,000 --> 02:32:49,000
and then followed by maybe

4011
02:32:49,000 --> 02:32:51,000
I'm not sure about Ignition

4012
02:32:51,000 --> 02:32:53,000
or

4013
02:32:53,000 --> 02:32:55,000
oh, who was the other one?

4014
02:32:55,000 --> 02:32:57,000
Yeah, Ignition

4015
02:32:57,000 --> 02:32:59,000
because they

4016
02:32:59,000 --> 02:33:01,000
really only release certain types of games over here

4017
02:33:01,000 --> 02:33:03,000
you know, really a lot of the RPGs

4018
02:33:03,000 --> 02:33:05,000
and that kind of stuff

4019
02:33:05,000 --> 02:33:07,000
so that wouldn't really fit with them

4020
02:33:07,000 --> 02:33:09,000
but access game localization, man

4021
02:33:09,000 --> 02:33:11,000
it's all sorts of weird shit

4022
02:33:11,000 --> 02:33:13,000
Graffiti Interactive would be good too

4023
02:33:13,000 --> 02:33:15,000
but they're really low budget

4024
02:33:15,000 --> 02:33:17,000
and it takes forever for them to get stuff out

4025
02:33:17,000 --> 02:33:19,000
Well, if you guys send out emails out there

4026
02:33:19,000 --> 02:33:21,000
we definitely want to see

4027
02:33:21,000 --> 02:33:23,000
Send your responses, the responses you get back from companies

4028
02:33:23,000 --> 02:33:25,000
We'll post something, I'll post something

4029
02:33:25,000 --> 02:33:27,000
in our forums for it

4030
02:33:27,000 --> 02:33:29,000
We'll post the information of where we need to

4031
02:33:29,000 --> 02:33:31,000
go with that

4032
02:33:31,000 --> 02:33:33,000
You know, I love the

4033
02:33:33,000 --> 02:33:35,000
Excuse me, I love the way people used the photo stream

4034
02:33:35,000 --> 02:33:37,000
last week to show pictures of President and Cat

4035
02:33:37,000 --> 02:33:39,000
and their fan art

4036
02:33:39,000 --> 02:33:41,000
So I would like to encourage people this week

4037
02:33:41,000 --> 02:33:43,000
You know, we're still a little bit on our President and Cat kick

4038
02:33:43,000 --> 02:33:45,000
We'll think of a new theme maybe next week

4039
02:33:45,000 --> 02:33:47,000
But continuing on that, I would really like to see in the photo stream

4040
02:33:47,000 --> 02:33:49,000
and email your pics to

4041
02:33:49,000 --> 02:33:51,000
pics at orangelondredare.com

4042
02:33:51,000 --> 02:33:53,000
They go right up on our website when you do that

4043
02:33:53,000 --> 02:33:55,000
So I would like to see

4044
02:33:55,000 --> 02:33:57,000
conceptual box art

4045
02:33:57,000 --> 02:33:59,000
for this game if released in the US

4046
02:33:59,000 --> 02:34:01,000
That's what I'm going to challenge folks to do

4047
02:34:01,000 --> 02:34:03,000
on the picture feed this week

4048
02:34:03,000 --> 02:34:05,000
And I do think I will

4049
02:34:05,000 --> 02:34:07,000
post some information about

4050
02:34:07,000 --> 02:34:09,000
possible companies that would

4051
02:34:09,000 --> 02:34:11,000
maybe distribute this or

4052
02:34:11,000 --> 02:34:13,000
localize it or something

4053
02:34:13,000 --> 02:34:15,000
because obviously it's their money

4054
02:34:15,000 --> 02:34:17,000
that they're risking and stuff

4055
02:34:17,000 --> 02:34:19,000
But I think maybe even as sad as petitions go

4056
02:34:19,000 --> 02:34:21,000
because they're crap online

4057
02:34:21,000 --> 02:34:23,000
Maybe an online petition might not

4058
02:34:23,000 --> 02:34:25,000
hurt because at least it shows

4059
02:34:25,000 --> 02:34:27,000
there's a few

4060
02:34:27,000 --> 02:34:29,000
hundred people interested in getting this game

4061
02:34:29,000 --> 02:34:31,000
over here to see what we can do

4062
02:34:31,000 --> 02:34:33,000
It gives people focus to

4063
02:34:33,000 --> 02:34:35,000
make their mark or something like that

4064
02:34:35,000 --> 02:34:37,000
and we'll go from there

4065
02:34:37,000 --> 02:34:39,000
Well if that's it for Last Minute Stories

4066
02:34:39,000 --> 02:34:41,000
tonight, then we're going to go around and get everybody's

4067
02:34:41,000 --> 02:34:43,000
final thoughts. DarkSakura

4068
02:34:43,000 --> 02:34:45,000
your final thoughts tonight

4069
02:34:45,000 --> 02:34:47,000
Loki, your final thought tonight

4070
02:34:47,000 --> 02:34:49,000
My final thought is

4071
02:34:49,000 --> 02:34:51,000
I have my arcade cabinet in my house and now I've got to

4072
02:34:51,000 --> 02:34:53,000
finish it

4073
02:34:53,000 --> 02:34:55,000
My final thought is I want chicken

4074
02:34:55,000 --> 02:34:57,000
I'll play a loco to be exact

4075
02:34:57,000 --> 02:34:59,000
which reminds me of this week's episode

4076
02:34:59,000 --> 02:35:01,000
of South Park which is kind of funny

4077
02:35:01,000 --> 02:35:03,000
Anyhow, that's going to do it for this week's episode

4078
02:35:03,000 --> 02:35:05,000
of Orange Lawns Radio

4079
02:35:05,000 --> 02:35:07,000
Just a word to the wise out there

4080
02:35:07,000 --> 02:35:09,000
to those folks that are listening live

4081
02:35:09,000 --> 02:35:11,000
We have Daylight Savings Time kicking in next week

4082
02:35:11,000 --> 02:35:13,000
So it's Spring Forward, Fall, Back

4083
02:35:13,000 --> 02:35:15,000
So we will be moving the clocks

4084
02:35:15,000 --> 02:35:17,000
back an hour here

4085
02:35:17,000 --> 02:35:19,000
to celebrate Daylight Savings Time

4086
02:35:19,000 --> 02:35:21,000
in your country or where you are

4087
02:35:21,000 --> 02:35:23,000
We're looking at you, Arizona

4088
02:35:23,000 --> 02:35:25,000
It's Arizona that doesn't have it

4089
02:35:25,000 --> 02:35:27,000
So please plan accordingly for those of you folks

4090
02:35:27,000 --> 02:35:29,000
that don't have Daylight Savings Time

4091
02:35:29,000 --> 02:35:31,000
I guess that was it

4092
02:35:31,000 --> 02:35:33,000
Yeah, I get my final thought

4093
02:35:33,000 --> 02:35:35,000
We're good to go

4094
02:35:35,000 --> 02:35:37,000
I always like to say also if you enjoyed Orange Lawns Radio

4095
02:35:37,000 --> 02:35:39,000
please tell two friends about the show

4096
02:35:39,000 --> 02:35:41,000
Help spread the word

4097
02:35:41,000 --> 02:35:43,000
because remember we have no big magazine backing us up

4098
02:35:43,000 --> 02:35:45,000
We have no advertising dollars

4099
02:35:45,000 --> 02:35:47,000
We rely strictly on word of mouth

4100
02:35:47,000 --> 02:35:49,000
We do the show for free, no ads

4101
02:35:49,000 --> 02:35:51,000
It's not even nine o'clock yet

4102
02:35:51,000 --> 02:35:53,000
I know, it's kind of early tonight

4103
02:35:53,000 --> 02:35:55,000
Not really, it's still been an almost three hour show

4104
02:35:55,000 --> 02:35:57,000
Maybe two and a half

4105
02:35:57,000 --> 02:35:59,000
But it's time to wrap it up

4106
02:35:59,000 --> 02:36:01,000
Get on out of here

4107
02:36:01,000 --> 02:36:03,000
Have a good night everybody, we'll see you next week

4108
02:36:03,000 --> 02:36:05,000
We'll be back with more of Orange Lounge Radio

4109
02:36:05,000 --> 02:36:07,000
on November 1st

4110
02:36:07,000 --> 02:36:09,000
Can't believe it's almost the end of the year already

4111
02:36:09,000 --> 02:36:11,000
Getting into the very very busy game season

4112
02:36:11,000 --> 02:36:15,000
Orange Lounge Radio

4113
02:36:41,000 --> 02:36:43,000
Right anyway

4114
02:36:43,000 --> 02:37:11,000
See you next week
