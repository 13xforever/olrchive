Playing early bootlegs Gichuban from Xbox, the PSP series gains heavy product placement tie-ins, and the classic arcade racer returns.

Yes, I was.
So we got to hear, and you have the full version now.
Yes, I do.
So we got to hear some of the mixes.
So I'm kind of curious what our chat thought of what they got to hear.
Sadly, you know, we can't reproduce it for the podcast because of copyright and all that.
But we were playing the, what was that?
Eric Pryde's Tears for Fears.
Eric Pryde's piano versus Tears for Fears shout.
And then, of course, MC Hammer with Can't Touch This and Vanilla Ice.
Which was sounding really epic in the beginning, but got a little.
It's not one of the better tracks in there.
But there's a lot of good tracks in there.
And we'll get into that later.
But I'm not disappointed at all.
Well, we'll get into that in just a minute.
I know Loki wants to talk about that during his gaming week.
But first, I need to plug our lovely bandwidth hosts.
The one and only www.allgames.com.
All Games Radio always helps us out by letting us steal their bandwidth every Sunday night.
And they are the home to a bunch of great programs.
Not just Bobby, who's usually on before us when he's not in a drum line.
All games radio www.allgames.com
Well, why not?
Sad.
You should come join us some Sunday.
And if you are hearing this on a Sunday night that happens to be October 18th, then we actually are live and you are tuned in to All Games Radio.
And you know that we're going to start off the show, as we always do, with a little bit of How Is Your Gaming Week.
DarkSakura, what types of video games have you been playing this week?
You do have to speak at some point during this radio show.
Okay.
I'm fine.
I play Peggle.
And how is Peggle?
What type of comics?
I will pull... Oh, look, my game decides to start working now.
I'm going to build a house live on air.
Deadpool 900, including the epic story of Deadpool versus mimes.
We have Deadpool versus mimes?
Yes, look at the cover.
Mimes.
That's not a very fair fight if you ask me.
They're mimes that are powered with psychological weapons that their mimery actually causes real damage.
Their mimery?
Their mimery.
Mimicry.
No mimery.
I like the word mimery.
Knock that miming off.
I've had to play with... You know...
I've got to play with your audio a little bit, by the way.
If you are hearing DarkSakura kind of fade in and out, it's live radio.
That kind of thing happens.
We adjust audio on the fly sometimes.
Because remember, though.
What?
A mime is a wonderful thing to waste.
Shut up.
Hey, wait.
I have an idea for a new segment, though, DarkSakura.
What?
We're going to do a segment called DarkSakura Reviews Games Through Grunting.
You ready?
What game should I review?
I'm going to name some games and you review them with a grunt.
Okay.
We'll start with something easy.
Sims 3.
Marvel Ultimate Alliance Yaris DJ Hero Speaking of which, I don't know if there's anything else Loki, do you have anything you want DarkSakura to review with a grunt?
No I can't think of anything else The Shadow Complex Okay, Shadow Complex Bayonetta
Alright.
Hey cheater, that's not even out yet.
It's pretty though.
She's wearing her hair.
Loki, how was your gaming week?
It was good.
Played lots of Grand Theft Auto.
Lost and Damned.
There's been rumors going out there and I've seen it now that people have found a way around the patch so they can re-enable mods again.
I've been trying to figure out how to do that.
And I'm close.
But what I thought I needed to change actually freezes the game up, so not quite there yet, but I'm on the path to getting it done.
And I've obviously been playing lots of DJ Hero.
I played it for a few hours today and yesterday, and most of the game starts off locked when you, you know, most of the tracks that you can play.
So I've actually unlocked almost everything in the game so far.
I mean, that's how much I've been playing it.
And
Thanks for watching!
DarkSakura
DJ Hero, DJ Hero
Dig Dug, Mr. Doom, Pac-Man, CGA, etc.
But you don't download games on PlayStation Network to play them in four colors now, do you?
Obviously the game's been fleshed out with a whole new high def mode and pretty crisp graphics.
So if you're into retro gaming, I think you'll kind of like this, especially because it combines the elements of all these old games.
I like a lot of the retro games, though.
It can get a little repetitive, so be warned.
But they do try to throw in some things to make it interesting, like co-op survival and
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Thank you for watching!
But not bad.
I'm not depressed with the money I spent.
But I don't think it's a wow, OMG, run out and buy it right now type game either.
I think if you like the old retro classics, you like your 80s PC games, you'll get a kick out of this.
But maybe you'll find out faster than I did that there's actually a fire button and you can actually shoot the oncoming enemies that makes the game a little easier when you feel a little overwhelmed.
Because I had no idea.
There's no tutorial or nothing to kind of get you going with the game.
So that's my one little piece of feedback for it.
Otherwise, OMG, World of Warcraft, LOL, WTFBBQ I'm just looking for donations, by the way Are you?
Yeah Everybody's looking for donations on this show Well, no, I mean, because I can't I know, I know But I am up to level 52 on my paladin I just hit 52 before the show tonight Which isn't bad, considering I think she rolled on September 3rd or 4th So I haven't been playing that long So I'm happy And I don't have triple XP or anything like that So I'm happy So
that's it for my gaming week pretty much otherwise the same type of stuff I already talked about last week like Demon's Souls and Katamari Forever and all that fun stuff so now that we've talked about our gaming weeks let's get into some housekeeping real quick but actually not a lot for that segment either so I'm just gonna plug our Twitter at www.twitter.com slash OLR and of course we also have our Facebook community just search for OL Army by the way we're gonna create an actual page on there too I can't remember if I mentioned this last week or not
I was going to work on that more this week but I got sidetracked leveling a paladin so I'm hopefully going to get that done actually we had a lot of shows that we were behind on the feed too three shows went up this week on the podcast feed so you can't say it and do anything for a while I got that just about caught up and yeah so look for that on Facebook and we have a MySpace if anyone actually uses that anymore does anyone use MySpace anymore?
I don't think so
The last thing I did on MySpace was look at my art history teacher's blog.
The last thing I did on MySpace was block spammers.
Nellie looked at MySpace the other day and she's like, wow, it looks like Facebook now.
They did change some stuff on there to try and make it more Facebook-y, I guess.
Facebook did something that makes me happy.
What's that?
I can now block everything I don't freaking want to see.
I can keep from getting this stupid sorority life invites.
They've had that for months.
Anyhow, let's move on.
Let's talk less ranting on social networking and more gaming news.
We'll start off tonight.
The wonderful Loki is going to start us off tonight.
Yes, Nintendo has partnered up with Capcom and 53 other video game publishers in Japan to file suit against four resellers of the popular R4 flash cartridge, you know, the one that launches the pirate stuff.
Apparently, though...
In Tokyo court, it banned the sale of the devices.
However, these four retailers are kind of ignoring that.
So there's a new lawsuit now that finally stopped these guys from selling it.
I mean, it's kind of interesting if you think about it, because...
They've been making threats about this stuff for a while now.
And I kind of find it funny that they're really only targeting the R4 because that is the most widely known backup device, but there's tons of them out there.
I mean, the R4s, I don't even think it's being used as much nowadays as some of these other ones.
I don't know.
But I guess it's a start because I know piracy really eats into the DS sales.
Especially overseas, right?
They have more of a problem with this overseas than they do here, right?
Definitely.
Are you surprised by this move?
I mean, I can't think of anything quite like this that I've heard of recently.
Well, it makes sense.
I mean, the court already banned the sales of this stuff.
They went ahead and ignored the loss, so of course they're going to have a lawsuit put against them.
I don't know.
It's not surprising, I guess.
Yeah.
Okay.
Why... Do you think there's a legitimate purpose for someone having an R4, or is this just straight-up piracy?
I mean, is there any type of way that they could come into court and say, oh, well, this R4 has a legitimate purpose, or I mean, is it just 100% piracy?
It does have a legitimate purpose as far as enabling homebrew, but once again, though, it's kind of reversing... reverse engineering, you know, the DS sort of to make it work, that kind of stuff.
So...
Yeah, it might allow for homebrew stuff, but any of the homebrew enabling...
Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Maybe later on some of the games will patch it so that you can't play those ROMs or whatever on your R4 device.
But the ones that are already made out there, there's nothing they can do about it because they can't patch it.
I got a wild question for you.
Isn't homebrew piracy in a way?
I mean, any homebrew that's cooked up.
Because aren't you supposed to buy a very expensive kit from Nintendo or Sony or whoever it is to develop for the system?
No.
We're supposed to buy these very expensive kits to help you do that?
And, you know, because of all the stipulations that they have, the testing process has to go through and, you know, development kits and whatnot.
Then, yeah, to be in market, you'd have to be like an authorized developer.
But this isn't really in market.
This is just kind of crap that they're throwing on there.
But it encourages people to hack their stuff, right?
People are going to hack it no matter what, whether the carts are out there or something else.
I mean, they'll find a way around it.
Hmm.
All right, well, I'm going to our chat room at chat.orangelawnsradio.com, and it looks like there's just other devices out there.
Azure Edge says, I have Ace Card 2.
I've never heard of this, but I guess that's another similar device?
Yeah, there's the Ace Card.
There's CycloDS Evolution.
They've also got the M3, I think like the D6 or something like that.
So why are we just hearing about R4 then?
Because it's the popular one, I guess.
It's just like, you know, like Napster.
Remember there was Napster and a lot of other file sharing services, but everyone went after Napster.
Oh yeah, LimeWire, Virus Heaven, I remember that one.
Well, I'm just saying that there were other services out there, but, you know, they're going to go after them.
Just like Pirate Bay.
They're going after Pirate Bay because that's the most, I guess, they're making an example out of them or something like that.
Yeah, but...
They really can't do anything about Pirate Bay.
Unless they get international law changed.
Didn't Pirate Bay have to stop?
Didn't something happen with that?
I mean, I don't know.
I don't use Pirate Bay.
It did, but it's still up.
So I don't really know.
I guess it didn't work very well.
Going to our chat again, Tiger Claw says, Homebrew is also used to create applications that can be useful for non-gaming purposes, like listening to internet radio and such.
Hey, I guess that would be useful, wouldn't it?
For programs like this.
well it's also the kind of you know put the applications and features that you want on a certain console it's a way to build those in where you know said company is not putting them in and actually some companies like Sony have learned from the homebrew community and see you know have seen what they put in there and they've added that support in later on
Sometimes little things kind of get endorsed too.
I seem to remember, you know, speaking of, because Tiger Claw's comment kind of made me think of internet radio on the Wii.
There was a program a while back, and I can't remember the name of it, and I don't even know if it's still developed, but it was a program that was supposed to let you get podcasts on your Wii.
Like it downloaded them to some program and then you... Sorry, not the Wii, the Xbox 360.
You can get podcasts on the 360.
And I remember it was really controversial because all the podcasts that were in it by default, it was downloading like the last five episodes all at once.
Maybe somebody in chat can remember the name of this.
And...
I remember we were listed in a future version of it after that bug was taken out.
The reason why I bring it up is that I seem to remember Major Nelson mentioned it on his blog or something.
That's why the thing got so popular so fast and it just screwed the bandwidth of all these sites.
I remember Gamer Andy was pissed about it.
TigerClaw says it's TVercity, but that's actually not the one I'm thinking of.
I think that lets you do podcasts also, but that's not the same one I'm thinking of.
That's what you use for streaming video.
Yeah.
POKEMON POKEMON
Nintendo officially unveiled the game this week, meaning screenshots and all that fun stuff.
It is coming out in Japan on December 5th.
It'll set you back 4,800 yen.
That would be $53 in exchange rates.
Sadly, though, it's not really a Pokemon Game Boy game on the Wii like people have been wanting, oh, I don't know, forever.
instead, it's a game where you are of course Pikachu because what other Pokemon is nearly as famous and you're in like a theme park and you tag, battle, and participate in quiz minigames oh joy, it's another minigame collection on the Nintendo Wii only this time, it has Pokemon but my Pokemans, let me show you them
Also, Pikachu interacts with new friends.
There's also a camera mode to let you photograph the Pokemon you meet.
I guess kind of tipping the hat to Pokemon Snap, which was kind of awesome.
But no words about Mudkips.
Sorry, guys.
But Pokemans, Rob.
I know it's Pokemans, but it's not like the Game Boy Pokemon games.
Don't care, Pokemans.
It'll sell.
Nintendo prints money.
I guess so, but I'm just like, yay, another minigame collection on the Wii.
Although, to be fair, they're talking about tagging and battling and all this other stuff, too.
And I shouldn't judge a game before I play it, but you're not giving me a lot to go off of here.
It's not like the Wii has demos, either, and I'm not going to spend $40 or $50 on a game just to find out it's another crappy minigame collection.
But, but, but, Rob, Pokemons...
DarkTattooia in chat says Pokemon Snap needs a sequel.
It sort of does, and maybe that's what they're trying to allude to with this, but I wouldn't say that this is a sequel by any means.
Now I'm looking at screenshots, and here's one where it looks like Pikachu's kind of fighting Charizard with some timer on the screen doing battles, so I don't know, maybe...
Maybe there's something cool in there, but it's not the role-playing Pokemon a lot of you guys have come to know and love, which I think is the game people really want on the Wii.
That's sad and a shame and a travesty.
It is.
You know what else is sad and a shame and a travesty?
What?
What Sega's doing.
What is Sega doing?
Bringing back a piece of my tortured past into full HD life.
I do not understand.
Please elaborate.
I don't know if I've ever told you about my nightmares of Daytona USA.
Even if you have, it's probably been years, so tell them again.
When I worked for my Namco Arcade, we had a four-person Daytona USA, and it would follow me.
I would hear, Daytona!
Or, Rolling Star!
What about Daytona?
That too.
But it's coming back.
It is coming back.
Oh, is it ever, as Sega Racing Classic.
Sega Racing!
And it's going to be on the Ringwide arcade hardware.
And it's being called Sega Racing Classic because they don't have the rights to the Daytona name anymore.
Oh, well that makes sense, I guess.
So I guess we're not going to get the Daytona...
So, but you know what I want?
Is I want cameos by Pepsi Man and by Sega Tassanchiro.
That would make me happy.
Sega always has the most interesting product placement in their games.
Because I think about Crazy Taxi.
I also want to race as the horse in the game.
And I want a little mini game in there where you can make the cars fight each other like Fighters Megamix.
X-Link in chat says, I work at an arcade and I hated that song.
Yeah, see?
Anyone who has worked in an arcade where the attract mode is turned sufficiently loud enough knows my pain.
Knows my pain.
I'd have nightmares.
I'm not kidding.
I would have nightmares.
Nightmares.
Nice.
No, it's not.
It's awful.
How would you like to be in the middle of dreaming about, you know, so-and-so gorgeous person and then hear, oh god, knock it off.
Maybe I don't understand because I've never played this Daytona game.
I just somehow missed it, I guess.
I played Daytona USA at the Luxor the first time I went to Las Vegas when the game first came out and had the eight-person big rally set up.
I thought it was cool then.
That's the last time I ever thought that game was cool.
Wait, don't they have this at Dave & Buster's?
They have something similar.
I think they have NASCAR.
Maybe I played it years ago when they had it at Dave & Buster's, I think.
I mean, it was one of those games that they would have linked like 80,000 units.
Rob, you just need to go on YouTube and look up Daytona Rolling Start.
Sure, I'd be happy to.
It's fantastic radio.
And this is how everyone would know.
There you go, Tiger Claw linked the theme in the chat room.
Yeah.
Dude, Tigerclaw's like faster at researching stuff than I am.
Might have already been on it.
And I'm saying that because there's like a 45 second delay.
I have played this game.
Yes, you have.
Yes, I have.
Now that I'm not hearing your horrible karaoke rendition of it, I recognize it.
You need to find the Rolling Start one, because that's the one that I still hear in my sleep.
How could you not like this song?
It's totally not repetitive.
Because I have something called taste.
This almost sounds like it could be like an 80s cartoon theme, you know?
That'd be awesome.
DarkSakura
Knock knock.
What?
What?
Shut up.
I will play it again.
I will fucking play it again.
I will kick you in the face.
You know, your ringtone is on my phone, by the way.
What?
I want to guess.
Is it?
No, no, no.
Let me borrow that toss.
Just let me borrow that toss.
So I gave you something more annoying.
All right.
I don't know what it is with this show tonight.
I'm just, I'm... It's called Jamie Has a Headache.
I feel sorry.
Oh, and Tiger Claw linked the Rolling Start, by the way.
Awesome.
That one, actually, I do like that one, okay?
Just because I think it's kind of neat.
I realize this game is like years and years old.
Rolling Start!
I love this soundtrack, what are you talking about?
It's more of a song you need to play the game to.
XLink in chat says, I'll fly over there and both of them in the face.
Except he left out, like, there's a word missing there, I think.
So, you know what you can do in the face?
Rob, you need to cleanse the palate.
All right, let's move on.
Loki, save us.
Yes.
Let's get into some release dates.
Perhaps that will end the Daytona chat.
Never, it will never end that chat.
Now, um, so coming out this week is actually a pretty good lineup of stuff.
Starting off, we've got Borderlands, which is making its way out to PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.
Did Rob mess up?
No, just go ahead.
I totally, like, skipped, like, three stories in the show, but that's okay.
Just do release dates now, we'll go back to it.
Alright.
Anyways, um...
I got too distracted by Daytona.
I'm sorry.
But it's good music to think to.
Alright, so yeah, as I said, Borderlands coming out this week, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, pretty awesome looking, so definitely check that out.
If you're into the football, or soccer as we call it in the US, FIFA Soccer 2010 will be coming out on DS, PSP, Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, PlayStation 2, and Wii.
Smackdown vs. Brawl 2010, also coming out this week on pretty much everything.
Space Invaders Extreme 2 making its way out on DS, finally.
It looks like the Wii version of NBA 2K10 was delayed to this week, so that'll be coming out as well.
Jillian Michaels Fitness Ultimatum 2010 on DS.
Yippee.
I know.
I'm excited.
Madagascar Karts on the Wii, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360, DS, and PSP.
And then with the Wii, of course, they also have a version with wheel, because goddammit, no one can pretend that the Wii remote is a steering wheel without a plastic piece of crap that's got attached to it.
Marvel Super Hero Squad coming out on PlayStation 2, Wii, and DS.
If you like your Marvel Ultimate Alliance super chibi.
Tropico 3 coming out on PC.
Charm Girls Club, Perfect Prom coming out on DS.
And yes, EA has a lot more to go with that as well.
Charm Girls Club Pajama Party on the Wii, Fashion Mall on DS, Fashion Show
And to go along with that, if you're not in the Charmed Girls Club, maybe Littlest Pet Shop, because they're whoring that out this week as well.
Littlest Pet Shop City Friends on DS this week.
Littlest Pet Shop Friends on the Wii.
Littlest Pet Shop Country Friends on DS.
And I'm sure there's one other one, but I don't really care.
What a bunch of crap.
Yes, exactly.
A bunch of horse crap.
Ha, because of the farm ones.
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do.
Daytona.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Thanks for watching!
They are!
Well, is your mic on?
I didn't... No, I turned it off because you said I was typing too loud.
That's right.
Well, so you had these grapes that were the size of eyeballs.
And it made me think how like... You remember like when you'd go to those haunted houses like when you were younger?
They'd put like frozen grapes like in a bowl and tell you it was a bowl full of eyeballs?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Cooking Mama Zombie Edition Mama Will Brains
Cookie Mama as the cleaner.
Don't worry, Mama will fix it.
DarkTetsuya in chat says, Cooking Mama, Rolling Stones.
Oh, that's going to be the joke all night.
Other games coming out this week.
Astro Boy, tying in with the new animated movie, coming out on Wii, PlayStation 2, DS, and PSP.
Secret Saturdays, Beasts of the Fifth Sun, coming out on Wii, PlayStation 2, DS.
My Tran Wars on PSP.
iCarly on DS and Wii.
God, it's just pitiful.
Mountain Sports on the Wii.
Yet another winter themed sports minigame collection.
Imagine Fashion Designer World Tour on DS.
Uh...
Crap, crap, and more crap.
Is there anything interesting?
Bakugan on PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Wii, and DS.
And I'm sure there's something I'm missing here.
Good stuff, good stuff.
Alien Monster Bowling League?
No, no, that's not good.
Your Mom the Game.
It's on the Wii.
No, Your Mom the Game, I'm sorry, is not coming out this week.
It's too bad.
She got delayed.
She got delayed, yes.
Diner Dash, Flow on the Go for DS
No, that's wrong.
So wrong.
The joke's right itself.
I don't have to say anything.
Medieval Games on the Wii for all your Ren Faire fans.
Grand Theft Auto Chinatown Wars coming to the PSP this week, which looks pretty cool.
Dragon Ball Revenge of King Piccolo on the Wii.
Star Wars The Force Unleashed Ultimate Sith Edition on PC World of the Zoo
Finally, um, let's see, I wanted to actually read something from chat here that was, um, from Sycoon saying, Orange Lounge is one big tangent today.
Yes, it is, and I'm gonna start another one here, because speaking of release dates, going to last week's releases, we had a huge game come out this week that nobody mentioned during their gaming weeks, Uncharted 2.
I, anywhere I look, I can't stop hearing about this game and how fucking amazing it's supposed to be, like, you
I don't usually play a lot of the platformy Tomb Raider type of games, which I hear Uncharted 2 kind of is, so I haven't really been paying attention.
But now, as I will hear about how awesome this game is non-stop and how people are already calling it Game of the Year, I kind of feel like I need to play it.
So I've got to turn to Loki, who's talked about this game a little more on the show than I have.
What have you heard about this game?
You didn't mention it either, but I seriously have not heard a single thing bad about it.
Like, not one.
I don't know.
It got good reviews.
I'm not buying it.
Why not?
Because I don't want to buy it.
Is it one of those things where it's like, oh, well, you're too cool for school.
No, no, no.
It's not even that.
It's an action game.
Not even so much like Tomb Raider.
I mean, that was kind of the comparisons of the first game were kind of like, oh, it's Tomb Raider with a guy.
Not so much now.
I mean, it's more of just an action game.
It's a very cinematic action game.
I just don't have time for it.
And yeah, I can see why they're calling it Game of the Year.
It's practically the only game coming from Sony this fall.
So it is the Game of the Year.
I mean, they did have games in the spring, but you know, for argument's sake, we're going to ignore those.
But I don't know.
It's good.
I mean, don't get me wrong.
Game of the year?
Probably not.
Kind of some polarizing stuff in chat.
Sycoon says, if I got a free copy, I would totally play it.
That's a good point.
Games are 60 bucks.
But again, I haven't heard a negative thing about this game.
It's probably worth it.
And HungryMrCrunk says, why aren't you going to buy it?
What?
Seriously?
What?
Daytona?
I mean, there are a lot of people that probably think you're crazy for what you just said.
I at least want to rent it.
and see if I like it and get us into it as everyone else does.
So I apologize I didn't play it for this week.
I'm not buying Modern Warfare 2 either.
Ooh, I'm crazy.
And GameGuru says game of the year for Sony fanboy maybes.
Ooh, yikes.
Don't get me wrong.
It is probably going to be the best PlayStation 3 game other than Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 that comes out this year.
But that's about it.
Best Sony made game this year?
Yes.
I'll probably play it at some point.
I can never resist peer pressure.
Okay, anyway, back to release dates.
Sorry.
Going to Japan and looking at the Japanese release dates.
FIFA Soccer 10 World Class Soccer comes out in Japan as well as Forza Motorsport 3 gets its run in Japan.
Those both coming out on the 22nd of October.
Moving on over to, of course, the PlayStation 3.
FIFA Soccer 10 also comes out over there.
That's really the only major release in Japan this week on the PS3.
And moving on over to the Nintendo Wii, another port of FIFA 10 World Class Soccer.
But there's some other games there as well, including Tsukiban Satchu Rena Wii comes out on the Wii.
And I like this because the box art is like this hot pink box art, and it's just kittens all over it.
And it looks like it's like a LOLCAT game.
Like, I'm not even kidding.
Oh, my God.
I shit you not.
It's not.
It's Keyboard Cat.
There's a scene with a cat playing the piano.
It's Keyboard Cat and Lol Cat, like in a game.
That is Game of the Year right there.
I'm sorry.
Fuck Uncharted.
Fuck it.
This is the Game of the Year right here.
Why don't they release this crap over here?
D3, come on.
Dear Working Designs, come back and bring us out.
If there is a game that you need to localize for the US, it is this game.
They're dancing with kittens.
And, oh my god, is that cat shooting a laser?
Oh my god.
We have laser cats.
This is it, right here.
Again, I'm going to say this name again.
Rob, email me that link.
I'm going to order that game.
It is Sukiban Shachu Rena Wee.
Question for you, Rob.
And this sort of ties in with that.
Why don't we move back to the old studio again?
I don't know.
Because we should.
Why?
Because I'll get that game and then we can do it on Justin TV.
Oh, I see.
Maybe at some point.
I can get that set up here.
We just need the camera.
I can get the camera.
That's easy.
Yeah, we can do it in the vault.
We'll figure it out.
But anyhow, the chat was demanding to check out that game in the chat room.
So I posted a link in chat.
I apologize to those on the podcast because I can't link it to you.
But again, that's S-U-K-E-B-A-N.
Sukiban.
S-H-A-C-H-O-U.
Shachu.
Rena.
R-E-N-A.
We.
That's the name of the game.
And it's cats, cats, and more cats.
It's an action game.
So...
I mean, seriously, how can you say Uncharted 2 is the game of the year when you have this game coming out on the Wii?
I just don't... I think it's clearly... That was a statement said without considering the rest of the year.
Well, I'm actually looking up reviews on it to make sure it's Lolcats the game.
Let us know what you find.
Okay, well, I still have to do...
Well, hold on, hold on.
I got some more releases here.
PlayStation 2, Beatmania 2DX 16 Empress is making its way out right now.
I think it was out a little early for some people.
I think it just came out in Japan this past week, but some of your import stores will finally have it in stock this week.
They know that this is one of the big games people like to import, and it's a huge release, obviously being the last 2DX game on PlayStation 2, so look for that.
On the Nintendo DS, Element Hunters comes out in Japan this week, as well as Rune Factory 3, and a game called Roller Angels.
Check that out.
And then lastly, on the Sony PSP, again, these are Japanese release dates, another release of FIFA Soccer 10.
Obviously, soccer is very big in countries that aren't the US.
And a game called...
Haru Kanaru, Toki no Naka, Day 3, Unmei no Meikyu, Aizu Ban, or Treasure Box.
And I've learned to look up these games and make sure...
Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
Do they have a Twitter?
They freaking have a Twitter.
But it's all in Japanese, right?
I'm going to follow the Japanese Twitter.
Alright, you do that.
Actdeft in chat says, now the folks in chat are kind of looking at what we just posted.
Leo Shen says, I got my copy.
Oh, he might have been talking about Beatmania because I just mentioned that.
Actdeft says, best Wii game ever.
Not even Epic Mickey will surpass this game.
Okay, I found a description from the Twitter, so I'm running it through the Nifty Translator.
And we'll see what it says.
Alright, let me know what happens.
Cat President and Choking Employee Recruitment on Large Scale Famous Cat Rena of the Superman Nature Blog finally appears in the game.
Let's work also by you under the Cat President.
What the hell does that mean?
Because it's translating.
That doesn't even fucking make sense.
I love it.
So he's like the President of Cats or something?
I guess this Cat Rena is a famous cat.
I've actually heard of the cat before.
I'm getting this game.
Fuck it.
I'm getting it.
Rob, let's get the communal OLR copy and find a Wii that we can play it on.
Amazing.
Loki has one, right?
I have a Wii that I'll play.
We'll have this game.
Don't worry.
It'll be coming.
Actually, this was just sent to me in chat is that we actually have an exclusive sneak peek at the soundtrack for this game.
It's amazing.
That sounds so familiar.
Okay, the next sound you're going to hear is my microphone connecting with the back of Rob's head.
Ready?
One, two... Ow!
Anyhow, um... President Cat.
Seriously, every other podcast you listen to, every single one of them will mention Uncharted 2 this week.
And they will talk about it.
They will suck its dick to no end.
What other show are you going to hear about this game on, huh?
I challenge you.
What other show?
Watch, there's probably at least five other shows that mention it.
But seriously.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
If anyone who can read Japanese wants to follow their Twitter, it's RenaWii, R-E-N-A-W-I-I.
Someone go start translating that for me right now.
You need to tweet to them, quoting them or something.
Yeah, just tweet to them.
and say, release your game in English, please.
Best game ever.
I'm going to go on the OLR Twitter right now and tweet to them.
Actually, I'm running their Twitter through Nifty.
I love... Anyone, if you want one of the best translators from Japanese to English, seriously, just look up Nifty Globalgate.
So, yeah.
They keep calling it President Rina.
I'm going to tweet them right now from the OLR account.
Can you send me the link to their Twitter in chat?
Yeah.
And then can we do the UK releases?
Sorry, I know you're trying to do five things at once.
Where's IRC?
There it is.
Alright.
So she's going to get me the Twitter there and I'm going to tweet them from the OLR account saying we demand that you release this game in English.
I'm linking it to the main chat room too because I want everyone.
Alright, sweet.
I'm going to go tweet them right now.
We want this game.
We want President Satchel means President, by the way.
Rob, Satchel means President.
Gotcha.
Well, now I've learned a little Japanese today.
All right.
Let's do UK releases.
Okay, a ton of stuff on the 23rd.
We have Borderlands, we have CSI Deadly Intent, Fairytale Fights, Forza Motorsport 3, Ghostbusters on PSP, Grand Theft Auto Chinatown Wars on PSP, Lips, number one hits, what the fuck ever, Marvel Super Heroes Squad, Nintendo Presents Style Boutique, ew, Pro Evolution Soccer 2010, WWE Smackdown vs. Raw 2010, and that's it.
and President Cat!
I'm making an icon of President Cat.
We are talking about your game on our show right now and we demand you release it in English in the US.
President Cat for USA.
Please, retweet the fuck out of this, please.
Thank you.
I'm going to post it shortly.
Okay.
Also, if any of our listeners that speak Japanese, please retweet it to them in Japanese.
Thank you.
This needs to happen.
Alright, anyway.
There's probably some people listening to this show right now like, what are they smoking tonight?
Release date 10-22.
Countdown will deliver a picture of their cute and funny friend, Rina.
Is a marijuana farm burning in Sacramento tonight?
I mean, seriously.
What is going on?
SSJ100 Matt says, Shermie is secretary of catnip.
Dude, I love this cat.
All right.
Moving on, there's other video gaming stories, believe it or not, other than President Cat.
We will keep you posted.
Please, again, please, please, please, retweet our message to Reno We.
We want them to notice.
Please.
Okay.
We want President Cat!
All right.
In other news that's not President Cat related and unfortunately makes it less important...
is Blaze, which is a company that makes third-party peripherals for game systems like the Wii and the PlayStation 3.
Well, they have now put out a brand new motion 3D controller that looks exactly like a Wii remote.
So much so, I wouldn't be surprised if they get sued for it.
But, hey, whatever.
It says it works fine as Sega Tennis and Tiger Woods.
But,
It looks exactly like a Wii Remote.
Good luck with your lawsuit.
However... There's always a however.
However, it will not work with President Cat because President Cat is coming out on the Wii and not the PlayStation 3.
Anyway... I'm also making a call, by the way, for making President Cat be a trending topic.
I hope it works.
All right, here's the thing.
Why are they doing this when the PlayStation 3 is doing their own, and how are they possibly getting away with it without Sony bringing the SmackDown?
I mean, doesn't this kind of thing have to have some type of Sony license anyway, especially considering the fact that it works with existing games?
Maybe.
I don't know how they're doing it, but it'll be, I don't know, something that's not...
Thanks for watching!
I mean, it looks like it's missing most of the buttons on there.
So, I don't know.
I'm confused.
It just looks like a cheap knockoff, which I'm sure it is, but I still don't understand the legal end of it, like how they can possibly get away with it and how Sony is letting it happen.
I guess it looks different enough than the Wii Remote, but it's basically got the trigger underneath where the B button would normally be.
It's got the directional pad at the top, just like...
TheWeeRemote
but it looks like cheap knockoff crap and you'd better just wait for the real thing.
It's tough when they're making this controller that really serves somewhat of a purpose but it's not that important.
It's not anything like the FragFX or something like that where you're actually making something that you use a mouse to aim or something like that so it's more like a PC.
But this I guess it's more immersive for Tiger Woods but I'd really just wait for the official release
and the official thing comes out I don't know
Fantasy Star Portable 2 is going to be getting some product placement.
and it's kind of extreme.
First off, there's going to be Fanta products in the game, like the drink, you know, one of Fanta, that whole thing, are going to be showing up in Fanta.
Those are still around.
Well, you're talking about the official drink of Germany during World War II.
I guess.
But then also, something to note is that Pizza Hut branding is now going to show up in the game.
Apparently, you're actually going to be able to have pizza-related shields and swords and things of that note.
And I'm looking at the site that is running this story here, andreasang.com, A-N-D-R-A-S-A-N-G.com, and they actually have screenshots of this chick, and it doesn't look Photoshopped.
I think this is the real deal.
Oh, that's the real deal.
A little Pizza Hut box and a pizza pan.
Yes, you will actually be able to get like pizza to seafood mix pizza for $2,500 meseta and cheese and cheese pizza for $1,900 meseta will actually be available in the game.
There's a little like pizza place in the game and so forth.
So, I mean, I just don't really like get it like a that sword and shield is God awful ugly.
But, um,
I mean, what does pizza have to do with Phantasy Star?
I mean, I guess it's like product placement, just like you see in the billboards in the racing games here in the US, but it's a little extreme, don't you think?
Well, keep in mind, Sega had a whole game based around Pepsi.
This isn't far-fetched.
I guess.
Pepsi Man, Rob.
They need Pepsi Man versus Pizza Hut.
You can't help but go, okay, this is a little bit much.
Like, it's one thing in Crazy Taxi to have the KFC and Pizza Hut that you have to drop people off.
Doesn't Pepsi Cola own Pizza Hut?
I think so, yeah.
Is Pepsi going to buy Sega?
Is that where we're going?
Maybe that's just what's going to happen.
I don't know.
TigerClaw in chat says, I remember seeing Pizza Hut billboards in TMNT 2, the arcade on the NES.
Yeah, it's not that product placement in video games is anything new.
It was Domino's in the movie.
I don't know if it's often talked about.
But, I mean, when it gets in your face so much, it's like you're carrying around a giant Pizza Hut box and, I guess, hitting monsters with it or blocking their attacks with it.
I mean, it kind of starts to cross the line of WTF, LOL.
Deathwishing says the acceptable games with product placement are sports and racing games unless they're futuristic.
But if it's a shooter or RPG, no, no.
And it's not cheeseball enough to where, you know...
They really could be over the top with everything like, you know, have product placement everywhere and just like ridiculous weapons based on, you know, the golden arches or something, you know, that'd be kind of funny.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
So, you play as the cat, and you are part of a trio called Let's Going 3, so I'm guessing it'd be Ikimasu 3, I guess.
And they are a very, very popular trio of cats.
And so, Rina, who is the editor-in-chief of production of a company, I guess, that puts out Shougakugen, which is like a shoujo manga.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
Thanks for watching!
I mean, because this is kind of like, the Wii is kind of a preposterous system to begin with.
This game just is right at home.
We need some more games that are just OMG WTF like this.
Amazing.
And Amazon JP is selling it for 4,410 yen.
When does it come out?
Oh no, duh, I just read it during Japanese releases.
It's out this week.
Someone buy me this!
Seriously, this is the type of random crap I would buy on Dreamcast.
Like, okay, I bought Super Producers.
If that game isn't random, I don't know what is.
Or like, what was it, the Roommate 202 or something?
Yeah.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
I think it's fantastic.
Okay, so Microsoft seems to think that the PS3 is screwed this year.
They think that the 360 will outsell the PS3.
Aaron Greenberg, who is the big mouth of Microsoft, is saying that when NPD releases the September sales, they expect the PS3 is going to come in with the most units sold for the month.
because of the slim release, but overall that the Xbox 360 is still going to outsell for the calendar year and for the entire system generation.
He compares it to a game of baseball where they may be ahead one inning, but it's what you get by the end of the game that's what counts.
So you may have won the battle, but you haven't won the war type of thing.
Exactly.
This is just one month.
And I have to agree with the article, this is burn.
He's quoted saying, Sony, for example, has publicly noted that they lose money on every console they sell, and with the price cut, they're now losing even more money.
So even with the PS3 in the market today at $299, you have to question if their business model is sustainable.
I don't know.
You know, as much as I think, you know, and I do admit I've been kind of in the past, especially on this show, like really slanted towards 360.
I think especially this year I have come a long way towards, and I don't mean in reporting, I mean in, you know, just what I play myself and what I've enjoyed.
I think this year especially I think PS3's gained a lot with me.
and I think, you know, kind of going into this holiday season, I think the prize drop was the best freaking thing they could do.
Let me tell you a true story, totally true, is that the other night I was eating dinner with some co-workers and the people at the table next to us, some like husbands and wives, about six of them in their mid-twenties and they were talking about
And so I couldn't help but overhear because I'm a nosy motherfucker.
So I actually heard them talking about the Xbox 360 and the PlayStation 3.
And the guy was talking about how he's going to sell back his 360.
And the one guy actually said, and it had nothing to do with the quality.
I think they were talking finances or something.
I don't know.
I didn't hear everything.
But the one guy said, well, you know, this holiday season, I kind of want to get a game system.
But I think I want to get a PlayStation 3 because, dude, it has Blu-ray.
You know, and...
And now that those systems are getting closer to the same price, you know, again, I don't think these guys were like hardcore gamers, but they are just average people I overheard at a restaurant.
I think that Blu-ray this Christmas season is going to carry a lot of weight and Microsoft's going to feel it.
But you can get a better quality Blu-ray player now for cheaper than the entire system costs.
For the cost of a good PS3 bundle, you could buy an Xbox 360 and a better Blu-ray player.
I get that, but what about that PlayStation 2 is a DVD player mentality that really helped out that system when it needed it?
You, me, the other gamers of America, we get that.
But the people that are purchasing things in mass from Walmart and Target to put under Christmas trees, are they going to get that?
Thanks for watching!
I still don't think that it's enough to save the system.
I would have to see hard numbers.
I would have to look at their financial reports.
I'd have to see what it costs to produce as a system, what their marketing costs.
Basically, I'd have to see overhead versus sales to get an idea to project.
It seems to me that they would have to sell a hell of a lot to make up past losses and their current losses for overall system sales versus the overhead.
Now, don't get me wrong, I haven't... Can you tell I've been working in finance too long?
Now, don't get me wrong, I'm not trying to say that I've suddenly, you know, hate the 360.
That's certainly not true.
I think either way, it's going to be, you know, Microsoft's going to definitely give them a run for their money, and they're probably, in the end, will still come out ahead.
But I think if they were smart, what Microsoft would do is kind of go for the jugular.
What's the biggest...
for the mass population asset of the PlayStation 3, Blu-ray.
But what does the 360 have?
Downloadable movies with Netflix, specifically.
I think if they start marketing a lot with that and their Netflix partnership, they are very likely to keep their head above water and not let Sony get them down too bad outside of just September.
But we'll see.
It's going to be a very interesting holiday season.
I can't wait to see what happens.
I know what would save the PS3, Rob.
What?
President Cat.
Shh.
Or how about Daytona?
No, President Cat.
Rina for President!
Moving on.
Loki, more video game news, please.
That doesn't have to do with cats.
Well, one thing that Sony doesn't have, unfortunately, is the Ballad of Gay Tony.
And that will be coming out, actually, next week.
Well, 29th, I guess, two weeks.
They did release some new information regarding the multiplayer in the new episode for the 360.
Some of the things that they get, new areas to have deathmatch and team deathmatches, including some new enclosed areas as well.
Some that are actually...
in the clubs, they have most of the deathmatch maps that are out there right now for Grand Theft Auto were all just pretty much spots in the city but these are actually in addition to that stuff at least I hope it's in addition to that and not just replacing it because that would really suck if they did replace it
Some other new things adding to Deathmatch other than just locations.
They have killstreak bonuses where if you kill 3 people, 5 people, or 10 people in a row you get health and armor bonuses and also if someone kills you breaking your streak they will earn $125 instead of just $100.
Also, for assists, where you do damage to somebody and someone else takes the kill for it, you also make $25 for that, whereas before you made nothing.
And, of course, they have new weapon classes to break things apart.
They've got episodic, automatic, sniper rifles, explosives, and sticky bombs.
I'm kind of interested about the episodic.
Lol, Gay Tony has sticky bombs.
Ha ha ha.
Yeah, I'm interested to see, though, if they actually, since it does have episodic, if it will include both the first and second episodes, which would be pretty awesome if they had some sort of cross-play with that.
Free mode, they've added some new options, including the ability to use the parachutes in the game, and of course your tanks and the new buzzard attack helicopter, which is pretty awesome.
and that's pretty much it for right now but very excited about this new expansion coming out okay so I have to admit like as somebody who doesn't really play a lot of Grand Theft Auto a lot of that was blah blah blah to me so you have to kind of translate is this going to be a good thing for the game yes it's gonna be awesome it's gonna basically enhance multiplayer a lot and bring it to the over-the-topness of the other Grand Theft Auto games all right and that's what people love about it right yes all right um
Left 4 Dead 2 Boycott Group
And this has to do with one of the co-founders, Agent of Chaos.
You might remember a couple weeks ago we talked about how they actually got invited to Valve's headquarters and so forth.
And we were kind of joking, oh, sold out and all this stuff, which certainly the community was accusing them of.
But they said, quote, our goal wasn't to steer people away from Left 4 Dead 2.
It was to get Valve's attention and have them support Left 4 Dead.
So apparently since they have continued to support Left 4 Dead with content, they have declared the boycott over.
The Boycott was a little silly.
Do you think they'll continue to support Left 4 Dead 1 even while Left 4 Dead 2 is out?
I mean, EverQuest 1 still got upgrade packs and EverQuest 2 is out.
Maybe.
I don't know.
Maybe.
You never know.
Well, you know, I never understood the boycott to begin with, so I can't say this is... Well, actually, it is surprising.
You don't usually hear about boycotts coming to an end.
You just hear about, come to my online petition and sign it.
So I guess I have to say I haven't really heard that before, but it is kind of lol-tastic that those guys actually went out to Valve and now they're canceling their boycott, but, you know, whatever.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Who cares?
You buy it or you don't buy it.
That's it.
And you'll bitch and moan about it all you want.
And post to the internet on your favorite forum.
Yeah, post to the internet.
Complain that it's not President Cat.
And then you'll just buy it anyways because you're a consumer whore.
And how.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Fine, you swam.
I don't know what you did.
Whatever you did.
The classic game is... Dude, you're way in there.
It's Hexen.
Not Heretic, but Hexen.
And this is actually the best quality of music I can find other than having the... Punch.
Smack.
Chicken.
So yeah, Hexen is a first-person shooter that was put up by Raven and published by ID... ID...
And it's actually a sequel to Heretic, however it has better points to it, which makes me really put it over the first one that came out.
There were PlayStation Saturn and N64 versions.
But the N64 one was the only really good one that came out.
It was the best conversion.
The Saturn and PlayStation ones actually had some... They were only one player and had some frame rate losses.
So anyway, you are playing as Kronos, who is...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
So it's, you know, it's first person.
It's, you go through these, you know, sprightly, fake 3D places and smite things.
It was Doom with magic.
It was Doom with magic.
And actually, Hexen uses the Doom engine.
So you can jump.
You can jump.
You also have a hub system of level progression.
And, um, this one actually had, where the previous ones used all MIDI music, this one actually used, um, full Redbook audio.
Um...
You've got moving walls in the game, so they actually had to modify Doom's engine.
Also, the source code was released in 2008, so now you can get Hexen for Linux, which is pretty good.
And also, it's compatible with a lot of the Doom source ports.
Um, there was an expansion pack called Death Kings of the Dark Citadel.
And, um, you could have, uh, it had 20 new levels and deathmatch levels.
And, um, you actually had to, uh, either buy it in store or buy mail order.
Um...
It's just a really good game.
It actually had some of the best cheats ever in it.
The NRA code was all weapons.
Nice.
You can turn yourself into a chicken.
Seriously, you can turn yourself into a chicken.
It's the anti-Zelda.
It was a fun game.
And I know you usually don't like first-person shooters because they make you sick because they're so realistic, but this was like right before.
Yeah, sprite-based isn't as bad.
It didn't really make me all that motion sick.
I mean, I'd have to stop because I'd get headaches, but it didn't really make me full-on sick to my stomach, ready to throw up, you know, on the cat or anything.
All right.
There you go, kids, your classic game of the week, Hexen from id, which you can still get.
In fact, someone in chat was saying they were just playing it earlier today.
Who was saying that?
I just saw it in chat a minute ago.
Gosh, I'm behind on chat or something.
Sorry, somebody had said they were playing.
Oh, there it is.
Frisbee says, I was just playing this online today through Skulltag.
So you can play it, I guess, online in different places.
So check it out.
Deathwishing, I guess, hasn't heard the chat on the show before.
Wants to know, how do you get sick from playing first-person shooters?
It's called vertigo.
I have a friend at work who has that real bad, too.
She can't get on boats.
It makes her very sick.
I really don't know what it is.
It's something between the eye and inner ear, I guess.
It's like, I guess...
I think it's that your brain starts compensating for the motion that it sees when your body isn't feeling the same motion and it causes a conflict in your balance and that just makes me sick right away.
Also, another thing that will do it to me is rendering errors.
When Sonic Adventure, when the Japanese version had all those bad rendering errors and the collision detection wasn't bad and you could actually see through the wall at some points and see the edge...
I couldn't process it.
It would just stop.
I would literally have to close my eyes because it would make my head hurt.
Hungry Mr. Crunk in chat says, I can't play Spyro.
I get sick.
Well, is that motion sickness or just because you're playing Spyro?
Brad from PodCulture says, well, Vertigo is a good flick.
Vertigo, shoot.
It's a good movie, but... I did know who did the opening credits for that, too, because we studied it in my typography, or my graphic design class, because the opening titles to it were so amazing.
Wasn't it the same as Psycho?
I think it was Saul Bass.
Saul Bass is seriously the best movie title designer ever, but I digress.
Deathwishing just seems to think it's bad games that make you sick.
Well, Goldeneye, which is supposed to be one of the best N64 first-person shooters, made me really sick.
I couldn't play Unreal.
I couldn't play Portal.
Oh my god.
You want to see me just get so sick?
Dan had to play through Portal for me.
I would tell him what to do.
So that he could look away?
I would tell him how to pass... Because I could easily see how to pass all of the puzzles and everything.
But I would literally have to tell him because the moment that I held the controller in my hand and actually looked at the screen to do it...
I would be sick.
Katamari does it.
Katamari makes me really sick.
I can't play more than two levels before I get way too ill to keep playing.
That sucks.
Alright, well, hopefully they'll come out with an app for that.
I didn't do it on my iPhone.
Well, iPhone's so tiny.
I didn't get that sick on my iPhone.
You probably don't get as immersed there.
SSJ100MAT does confirm it's Saul Bass.
Yeah.
I knew it was Saul Bass.
Alright, for anyone who ever wanted to know, I don't know if you do, but Saul Bass is one of my designer heroes.
So, just go watch the opening credits for The Man with the Golden Arm and you'll know.
Stay tuned!
Orange Lounge Radio
Yes, that Paul Van Dyke track, the one we played, absolutely awesome.
They had a demo online, or like a little clip online, their YouTube channel.
I just love that song, and I couldn't wait to play it, and it's really hard.
Yeah, that was a... It has a lot of cross-fading in there, and it's really hard.
I was actually able to listen on the iPhone app for all games, which, by the way, if you own an iPhone and you don't have this app, it's awesome.
You should check it out at allgames.com.
DarkSakura.com
We have breaking news developing right now.
The folks at Reno Wii, the President Cat game that we were laughing hysterically at in Part A, they have responded on their Twitter.
And boy, have they ever.
I don't think they know what the hell is going on right now.
They responded to one of our listeners, Technicolor, who tweeted our message that said, please release this game in the USA.
They said, really?
I'm so excited.
Is this spam?
So, A, we know they speak English.
Even though they've been tweeting in Japanese, somebody over there speaks English.
and then they tweeted to us and some other listeners, can I ask one question?
How do you know this game?
And I think somebody said back to them that they were hearing it here on Orange Launch Radio.
They tweeted back, oh my goodness, really?
Thank you so much.
I'm talking about this with coworkers right now.
They are all excited.
If this information on some website, let me know the URL.
Please retweet.
And they've been corresponding with one of our listeners on Twitter.
Edmund Liu, I guess, has been helping them out.
And...
They told them that we were getting it from PlayAsia.com, the release dates, which is where I read the Japanese release dates from.
And they responded, thank you so much.
And they retweeted so that all their followers could see it.
OLR talked about it on their radio show, and it really looks like an interesting game to play.
And then they said, thanks, is this popular in the USA?
Sorry for many questions.
So in the scope of just that time that Loki was playing DJ Hero during the break, they've tweeted six times about this...
President Cat takes over the USA tonight live on Orange Lounge Radio thing going on I also replied to that last thing saying that that yeah some gamers like that kind of thing stuff other than the sports and the typical RPG and that I personally love those kinds of games oh and oh they just less than a minute ago they have responded to one of my tweets because I wrote them back saying we found it on our weekly Japanese release date reading and think we need more low cat inspired games how can we help get game in USA and
DarkSakura.com
Sorry for the dead air, so I'm tweeting back right now.
Yes, game in English and playable on our American Wiis.
The chat room is shouting, get them on the show, get them on the show.
I don't know if Japan can call our 800 numbers.
I have a friend that lives in Japan.
Who is currently, you know Julie?
Yeah.
Julie is in Japan right now.
Julie is with Krista.
Krista speaks fluent Japanese.
I wonder if we can get them on Skype or something.
I don't know.
I'll tell them.
They added us back so I can direct message them.
So I'll tell them to email me.
I don't want to do anything tonight because it's all panning out too fast.
But we'll try to get them on a future show.
I am going to love this.
AlphaKananaGram in chat says...
This is one kick-ass episode of OLR.
Let me put it this way, okay?
There's many companies out there like Tomo, well, not necessarily Tomo, but was it UFO Interactive Games and stuff like that?
They port really obscure shit.
I mean, just really obscure Japanese RPGs.
Or not even Japanese RPGs, like Japanese shooters and just weird games for budget prices.
One of these companies could easily pick this game up.
It's just whether they think they can actually sell some copies of it.
They just tweeted it again.
And keep in mind, it's like noon in Japan on a Monday morning right now, right?
Because they're across on the other side of the dateline.
So it's probably about noon right there.
And they just tweeted again, great people, awesome.
And they put, at OLR, there are many piano-playing, cat-loving people.
Because that's what I said to them.
So this is amazing.
So we're going to correspond with them.
If they could do a viral advertisement or whatever with Keyboard Cat, I think they could have something.
It could get the whole mame-loving people involved.
Especially if the price is right, you know?
Let me see if she's online.
Anyhow.
Anyhow, I don't know what we have to do.
If we're going to have to do one of those silly online petitions or what.
But meanwhile, we have a show to do.
We've got to get to Twitter topics.
Here's the thing.
I am not prepared for Twitter topics because usually I can just click on the at OLR messages and they're all right there.
But tonight, because of President Cat, our Twitter is full.
So I need to go back a little bit.
I'm going to mix things up a little.
Why not?
It's one of those nights.
I think we should put a post on the front page about bring President Cat to the U.S.
I mean, that would be awesome.
We'll figure something out.
Absolutely.
Maybe we can get some of our friends at GameBallers involved.
I don't know what we can do.
We'll figure it out.
All I know is that all unfolding live here on Sunday night might be a bit much.
So we're going to get into some Twitter topics.
I'm sorry.
Fast news.
Loki's going to cover some quick news stories for us.
Yes.
Okay, so Final Fantasy XI, the Ultimate Collection, not the first collection that they've released on PC, but probably the last, will be coming out, of course, for $20 soon.
November 10th is the date that's coming out.
And actually, that will be coming out on 360 as well.
And as you might expect, it's basically...
Final Fantasy XIV Final Fantasy XIV
Also, Zen Studios, the creators of such wonderful games like Zen Pinball, Pinball FX, and The Punisher No Mercy are releasing a brand new game to the PlayStation Network called Planet Minigolf.
It is going to be a game featuring 144 minigolf holes with several exhilarating courses around the world, they say, complete with crazy obstacles and six customizable characters.
And it looks pretty sweet.
I love me some minigolf games.
Um, finally, as rumored, um, Sony is releasing a 250 gigabyte PlayStation 3 Slim model over here in the US as well.
Um, it is coming standalone, no packing games with that, and only for $50 more than the 120 gigabyte system.
So, a $349.99 will be the price on that.
Which is not a bad deal if you're looking to really pack a lot of crap onto your PlayStation 3 hard drive.
Um...
So that'll be coming out around November 3rd.
All right.
Sorry, they wrote back again.
I hate to keep going back to this, but I'm loving this.
They're asking their boss right now.
They put, wow, ask my boss.
Ha ha, wait a minute, please.
And retweeted our message about, yes, game in English and playable on our American Wiis.
How can we help make this happen?
So some executive at some Japanese game company right now is hearing about some crappy little internet show in America that wants this damn game.
Dude, totally want President Cat.
Amazing.
I love the internet.
And hey, you know, maybe if all else fails, they'll just send us a Japanese Wii game.
Just put it on WiiWare.
I mean, honestly, it can't be that big of a game.
I mean, just put it on WiiWare.
President Cat!
Alright, well, when Twitter ladies, bosses, or guys, I don't know who it is, but when that boss gets back to them, we will have more.
Meantime, more late-breaking, well, not late-breaking, but rapid-fire news anyway.
News about Super Mario Bros.
Wii, the new one coming out.
Did you know Princess Peach is not playable in the game?
Actually, this was brought up recently in an interview with Miyamoto, and Miyamoto commented...
Is that maybe a throwback to the fact that people in Super Smash Bros.
Melee were just pausing the game to do upskirt cams on Princess Peach and Daisy?
I don't know.
But regardless, it sounds like they're trying to skirt the issue.
Mass Effect 2 now has a release date.
It's coming out in North America on January 26th, and it's coming out in Europe on the 29th.
Is there really anything else you need to know?
Well, you might want to know about the GameStop pre-order bonus that they're offering.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Duels of the Planeswalker gets a new expansion on Xbox 360.
They think the name is Duel of the Dragons, but it is being priced only 400 Microsoft points.
It is coming out on the 21st of October.
It's going to add three playable decks and three unlockable cards for all of the original decks.
So there you go, some new expansions coming to Magic the Gathering, which hopefully you didn't forget was out there on the Wii.
Let's do...
Jamie's Stories.
We never did our closed deck tournament, Rob.
We never did.
We need to.
Well, how about some news about Alpha Protocol, which actually really isn't very much news because I think we expected it.
It is delayed instead of being out, even for Christmas, they're pushing it back to spring 2010.
But Obsidian, the developer, is actually pretty happy about that because it gives them more time to make sure it's really polished and looking the way that they want it to.
So I think that's a good thing.
I would rather wait for a good product than have to deal with substandard.
Delays aren't always a bad thing.
Delays can sometimes end out pretty good.
Also, two characters for Tatsunoko vs. Capcom have been released.
We have Condor Nojo as Joe the Condor from Gatchaman.
He was G2, the one who always wanted to fire the bird missile.
Also, just to say, for anyone who watched Battle of the Planets, it was Jason.
It was Dirk in GeForce.
Anyway, I'm the Gatchaman fangirl, so I'm very happy about this.
And then...
There's also Zero.
Zero is going to be out, as in Zero from the Mega Man X series.
So that's going to be pretty sweet.
I actually watched videos of them in motion, and it was epic.
Also, the team up with...
They had a Joe and June on one of the matches I saw and they did the Tatsumaki attack.
That was pretty cool.
That was pretty damn cool.
I'm looking so forward to this.
Except I really don't like what they did with the Tatsunoko logo in English.
It doesn't look nice.
They should have just stuck to the Japanese one.
and last but definitely not least Blur is going to be in Lego Rock Band and there are little Blur shaped Lego stick people all bricked out for Lego Rock Band so that makes me pretty happy I'm just sort of laughing at the little Damon and the little Graham I think that's pretty funny
That's just cute.
But that's it.
All right.
Moving on, we're going to get into some Twitter topics.
You guys ready to do Twitter?
I know we had a lot of Twitter tonight with what the developments with President Cat, which apparently they just posted some type of comic that has our chat room in stitches right now.
Oh, I see.
I'm loving this.
I mean, live radio doesn't... I'm serious.
We should petition this stuff.
We should send it all out.
You know, tell people why this game needs to come over here.
Well, let's wait and see how they respond.
I can actually read some of this.
Alright.
Anyhow.
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean for President Cat to take over the show, but... Goddamn.
This is cute!
OLRZO, President Cat won.
Let's just face it.
President Cat is the fourth host tonight.
Alright, Twitter topics, dammit.
Things that don't involve President Cat, believe it or not.
Questions when our tweeters give us stuff at OLR.
Deekman wants me to remind you all, you can now post pictures to the photo stream.
So if you send a picture to pics at orangelaunchradio.com, it will now go to our website at www.orangelaunchradio.com and it'll be right up there for everyone to see.
so don't send pictures of penises or I swear to God we'll remove this like that but if you have like gaming stuff you want to put or maybe it's a challenge this week to show our love for President Cat you need to upload pictures in fact we should give a challenge to the listeners every week I love this idea since President Cat has taken over the show tonight we want people to upload pictures to the stream showing their love for President Cat because this will help the developers show that they are the next big thing in the U.S.
Let's make that happen.
Other Twitter topics going on.
Oh, shoot.
I somehow accidentally clicked on an ad.
Oh, man.
No.
Advertisement fail.
Ryan Belknap wants to know, what do you guys think of Glee and Flash Forward?
I love Glee.
I think that show's amazing.
Flash Forward, I watched the first episode but wasn't able to watch anything after that.
I just haven't had time because I've been watching a bunch of other shows.
Thanks for watching!
My wife is excited about the fact that they're going to be going on tour.
So she wants to go see that.
Did that get officially announced?
I don't know.
I want to see it too if it goes on tour.
I'll take your wife if you don't want to go.
And then also, flash forward, I've actually watched.
It's good, but it's slow.
That's the only problem.
But it is getting interesting.
But it is very slow.
I like Fringe better, but I watch them both.
It's by the people who do the 4400.
But you know what I haven't been watching, though?
And I hear it's actually good this season.
Heroes.
Really?
And I stopped watching it, too.
Because I'm watching House.
Because House is on at the same time.
I'm sorry.
House wins.
Can I say, though, I got introduced to It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia the other day.
Oh, my God.
That show is fucking funny.
Oh, my God, that show is funny.
I've really been kind of...
Thank you for watching!
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Spazinator wants to know, how about the apparent leak by Naughty Dog on the official PS boards regarding cross-game chat coming to the PS3 in firmware 3.1?
Well, you kind of summed it up right there what the news story is, and all I have to say is I hope so.
I mean, sadly, as much as I've said nice things about Sony tonight, I think that they're still lagging big time in the online war.
But they're free, so I guess you get what you pay for, but this would be nice.
It's certainly a nice feature.
I mean, of course it would be.
Yeah.
Let's see.
Gamer Girl asks, what's the most fun game you've ever played?
Like so fun that when it's over you'd play it a million times no matter what.
Oh my gosh.
I don't know if I want to go like 8-bit or like newer stuff.
I can always play The Guardian Legends.
You know I talk about that game very fondly on this show and I love that game.
I can always go back to that.
If you want to go to a true 80s arcade classic, Dig Dug.
I can never stop playing Dig Dug.
Peggle.
Redertainment asks, I have a big pile of strategy guides I want to get rid of.
Suggestions?
If you have the versus Final Fantasy 7 one and it still has the poster in it and it's intact, give it to me.
Also, winter is coming.
Because I don't want to pay $100 for it on eBay.
I had that poster, but my drunk girlfriend kicked it and it accidentally ripped.
I had the strategy guide and the poster and everything, and Dan's friend ripped the cover and drew on it.
It was a long time ago.
I'm pissed off.
That particular strategy guide goes for a lot of money on eBay.
Seriously.
The versus books Final Fantasy VII one.
Reno, we just responded to you, Jamie.
Oh, Lord.
She's busy tonight.
Sorry.
It's taking over Twitter tonight.
I just, I can't help it.
Anyway, that's going to do it for Twitter topics tonight.
Sorry if you guys didn't get through.
Don't forget, you can always send us an email, mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com.
And if you're really upset your tweet didn't get through, blame President Cat, because that's been monopolizing our Twitter discussion this evening.
But I love it.
It's got a cat licking its nose.
It's so cute.
Exactly.
How about some other gaming news, Loki?
I don't know if I could do any more gaming news.
It just feels so insignificant compared to President Cat.
But anyways, we'll move on.
So apparently people are getting banned for playing pirated copies of Forza and Borderlands.
Really? !
Is that a shock to you?
That, you know, playing games that you've burned early is gonna get you banned off Xbox Live?
But yeah, that's the case.
So, apparently, if you are gonna go the illegal route with Forza Motorsports 3 and Borderlands, you might wanna wait until the game comes out.
But, um, yeah.
And it's, ironically, though, you're gonna get banned, but only your live account's gonna get banned, not your console, because they still want you to buy games, apparently.
But, um, you can always create a new live account.
Or if you're really going to play this that early, just play it offline.
Or play it on a banned console.
I heard, though, they only ban the console... Or no, they ban the account and not the console.
Yeah, the account.
In some way, they knew whether you're playing a legit game or not.
I almost picked up Borderlands early, too, but I figured I wouldn't get to it because I'd be playing DJ Hero, and that's really what's going to happen.
I'm going to wait for Borderlands to come out because I don't know when I'm going to get to it.
And...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
I hope none of my consoles get banned.
Interesting.
Of course, ironically enough, this is kind of off topic, but since I have modded consoles, I'll go ahead and talk about it.
It's not even really the fact that they're modded, it's the fact that they're older generation consoles.
I've had a 100% failure rate with Xbox 360s, the first generation of them.
I've had
and I have another one that's dead or that's gonna die it's freezing up now and it was actually one that Microsoft repaired of course I went and modded it so now they can't repair it again but anything that like the new arcade systems you know when they have the HDMI ports and stuff on them I can actually those live sort of it's just the older ones do not my sister's console which I actually have a new one coming for her
Thanks for watching!
And you know, their console's good, and I will buy another one.
Of course you will.
Because I'm a sucker like that.
Because Grand Theft Auto 4 is awesome, and I have to mod it.
Well, now, I'd be curious to know if Loki's going to buy this.
It's something for the Wii that has nothing to do with President Cat, but it does have to do with an exercise bike.
Now, I seem to remember on the show a couple weeks ago, we were talking about some type of patent for an exercise bike.
Well, it wasn't a patent.
It was a leaked...
Well, it looks like this has come to fruition because Cyber Bike Cycling Sports is coming out.
But here's the thing.
It's not from Nintendo.
It's coming from publisher Big Ben.
And it comes with a, yes, full-size exercise bike controller.
And apparently it's very easy to set up.
It has an adjustable saddle.
It has handlebars and all this.
It's also compatible with Mario Kart Wii.
Go figure.
But the game that comes with it is called Cyber Bike.
It's supposed to come out in 2010.
It looks stupid.
Okay.
The other one, which looked pretty ridiculous to begin with, had a smaller peripheral.
I mean, I could understand maybe having that because that's a little bit smaller.
Maybe there's some games that might use it later on, but this is a full fucking exercise bike.
You do not need an exercise bike to go with the damn game.
Just buy an exercise bike if you're going to buy an exercise bike.
Alright.
Um...
Moving on, DarkSakura.
Oh, yes.
I'm sorry.
I'm still... No, I know.
I'm so distracted with the Rina Wee thing, too.
They said something again to you.
To me?
I see.
I'm a little confused now.
Many follower in English.
Oh, oh, grr, my poor English.
I almost feel bad because they've got to be overwhelmed right now because their Twitter only had like 80 followers, which is fucking criminal.
Yeah.
and they've already got like 20 new followers throughout the show tonight and it's probably going to continue to grow as people listen to this podcast.
Please go follow them.
They are feeling like probably a little overwhelmed at this whole thing but people need to know.
Cats are adorable, damn it.
I know.
So if we're distracted tonight, sorry.
I'm sorry.
If Keyboard Cat can be as popular as it is, if Keyboard Cat can get referenced in Scribblenauts, there is no reason.
Okay, if they can put out all these stupid party games that don't sell...
Thanks for watching!
Alright, SJ100Matt in chat speaking of the last story says, wait, Mr. Garrison's wild wacky action bike, the game?
No, it's not that kind of peripheral, but I bet with a little duct tape you can achieve anything.
If you want.
Question is, Rob, how quick before someone tries to put their penis in it?
That is always a quintessential question here on Orange Lounge Radio.
How quick before someone tries to put their penis in it?
In the exercise bike, not long.
I mean, I don't know really where you would put your penis, but I'm sure somewhere it'll happen.
Alright, anyhow.
Sorry, DarkSakura, we keep interrupting.
I know you're trying to correspond with Rina Wee, but there is a show still to be done.
I'm just saying, thank you for being patient with us.
I wish I knew better Japanese.
Well, back to Nintendo.
Miyamoto has actually brought back a little bit more conversation in regards to HD Wii by saying that they want to support new technology as it comes out.
And he's actually even saying that if he was a consumer that had an HD TV, he'd want to play his games with nice graphics too.
Um...
So they're actually going to be moving with it as HD technology becomes more and more prevalent, which really it is.
I mean, you know what I mean?
But they are pretty...
Adamant that they're going to focus on gameplay but not close the door on HD.
In fact, there's actually some financial analysts already that are saying that it's definitely going to happen this summer.
And I think that it's... I don't really know how they're going to do it other than add-ons, but...
Well, I think, you know, we've been saying on the show for some time, the Super Wii or the Wii HD that will be backwards compatible with the original Wii.
The Wii Double D. Yeah.
The Wii with four eyes or something will, is inevitable.
It's going to happen.
I think the question is when, and certainly, you know, summer 2010, I don't need a mega expensive analyst to tell me that.
I mean, I think I said that on the show months ago, that it's probably going to happen.
Of course, I also called it for this year, so I'm not always right, but this is why I do the show for free.
I don't want another Wii HD.
I'm finding my Wii right now.
Is that just because you don't want to spend more money, or what's the deal?
No, I don't think money is an option.
The problem is I'm so jaded by what they've done so far at the Wii.
Why do I really want to go through the gamble again?
Because tonight we have seen its potential.
Listen, okay, I am checking my bank account.
Why am I checking my bank account?
Because I am buying President Cat.
This purchase is imminent, okay?
It's happening.
I'm buying it too.
I'm buying it too.
I don't even have a thing that can play it, but I'm going to buy it.
Why?
Because...
I don't know.
Don't fucking judge me.
I just want it.
I will look at the manual and purr at it or something.
I don't know.
Someday my Wii will play it.
You want to pay for my massage for me?
Get me President Cat.
Plus, I oddly want to support this.
I do too.
I hope the game doesn't stink.
Oh yeah.
I don't care.
I don't care if it stinks or not.
The whole fun is going to be the whole novelty.
Keep in mind, it's taken me a long time to actually sit and read the blog.
Just the little comics of the cat.
But it's freaking funny.
Cat's like, why am I on your t-shirt?
Pat, pat, pat.
I'm like...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
Anyhow.
WeHD.
I think it's going to happen.
It'll be backwards compatible with all the Wii games.
It's just a matter of when.
We know it.
It's a must.
They replied and said, I wish I knew better English too.
Aww.
I just want to hug them.
You know, I am supposed to go to Japan next year.
I should offer to come give her a hug.
Or him.
I don't care.
I'll hug them, whoever they are.
Anyhow.
Loki.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Um.
So, speaking of Xbox 360 updates and possible bannings of people and stuff like that, there is another update that's going to ban stuff, and that will be, of course, the fall update.
It will be banning unauthorized memory units.
Yes, you may remember we talked a little bit about max memory units being put out by, I believe, Datel, and these will allow you to use a...
was a micro SD card and supported up to 2GB to 4GB of memory.
Which is awesome, because the Microsoft memory units are really fucking expensive.
For like $50 or $40, you get a 512MB memory unit, which is ridiculous.
Especially since, hell, you can get a 4GB USB drive for nothing.
So...
Being the greedy bastards that they are, they decided, hey, you know what?
We don't want you to sell this, and so we're going to block it.
So if you bought it, you're shit out of luck.
And there's nothing you can do about it.
But people are pissed.
But Microsoft says, who gives a shit?
It's our console.
We'll do what we want.
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah.
I'm kind of on the fence with this.
I think they... They have the right to do it, but it's a dick move.
They have the right to do it, but it's a cock-block move is what they're doing.
It kind of sucks because the person who loses here is the consumer, not the developer of this memory unit.
They already made the money from selling it to the consumer.
It's the consumer who's shit out of luck.
If I'm understanding this right...
This isn't aimed so much as things that might be in stores, because there aren't a lot of these unauthorized things in stores.
This is aimed at people trying to jerry-rig hard drives to do everything, right?
No, this is aimed at... Well, these devices are aimed at just the consumer, but it's a cheaper alternative with more memory.
But it's not being offered by Microsoft.
And so, therefore, it goes away.
It's the same reason why there's no third-party hard drives.
Because I can tell you this much, hard drives are damn cheap.
Especially these drives they're offering for $150.
You can get a terabyte drive for $150.
I guess that's true.
I think Microsoft does kind of rip off a little bit with their storage, but this is...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
So they can block it by the device ID.
Same with controllers if they want to.
I think they can block controllers that way too.
But they don't.
But the thing is though, when the new 250GB hard drives come out, there are ways out there to make your own hard drive for the 360 by modifying a laptop hard drive.
So if you want to go through the trouble, you can do that for cheaper.
And now you can do it up to 250GB.
Super Mario Bros.
Wii
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
What will happen is that then a video is going to show up.
Luigi plays through the stage.
It's not going to show you hidden paths.
It's not going to show you hidden coins.
It just kind of shows you how to get through the stage.
It will show you how the stage could be completed.
At any time, the player can jump in and take over, and then the game basically will have played you through the parts you can't get through.
If you want, though, you can just let the game complete the level for you and move on to the next stage.
Now, Miyamoto has said there are some disadvantages to using Super Guide.
If you decide not to use the Super Guide at all during the game, you stay away from the blocks and don't use them, you get something special.
Of course, that could be anything.
Could that be something new on the title screen?
Could it be an unlockable character?
Who knows what that could be.
But if you rely on them, you're going to miss out.
And, of course, you know...
Just the whole morale of the fact you had to use the Super Guide to beat the level.
A quote from Miyamoto in a little article that is running on Destructoid right now.
I find that when the Super Guide block does appear, I kind of feel regretful and guilty that I've let that happen.
So I've often found that playing the game, when that happens, it kind of inspires me to say...
I've already done this bad, now I have to clear the level on my own.
So, you know, I guess they're saying that you just feel a general sense of, well, you cheated to beat the level in order to actually get through it.
So, I don't know, what do you guys think?
Now that you hear the details on how this actually works, that it's a brick that appears if you die eight times, what do you think?
Is it still a joke?
Is it useful?
It's got a use for it, but, you know, at the same time, it's kind of...
Thanks for watching!
Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
I'll talk to her President Cat
GameGuru says, Problem with Wii HD coming out before the next Xbox or PlayStation is that it won't be graphically on par with them and won't initially have the Wii's fanbase.
That's going back to a previous news story, but that's okay because I know there's a little delay.
XLink calls this Super Cheater 5000 is the name of the device.
You know, again, I think we have to remember the audience this is aimed at.
And I think for the casual player, this is...
you know, gonna be a good thing but I think for the rest of us I do really like the fact that you at least get some unlockable if you don't do it I just hope that unlockable carries some weight a little bit you know, unfortunately Wii doesn't have anything like achievements so hopefully it'll have some type of e-peen that you can show other people because who doesn't like to stroke their e-peen?
DarkSakura, don't you love to stroke your E-peen?
Yeah.
Alright.
One way DarkSakura likes to stroke her E-peen is every week she'll open up the mailbag and read some emails from our listeners at MailbagAtOrangeLoungeRadio.com So DarkSakura, please open up the mailbag.
There wasn't very much when I looked in there earlier, but maybe there is now.
There's one.
One email!
From J-Rod.
Alright, well let's read it tonight.
It's tonight's mailbag segment.
And we'll just have to roll anything that comes in now to next week.
I anticipate we're going to have a lot of President Cat emails this week, but we'll see.
Hello, OLR crew.
I currently listen to the latest podcast on the feed where Robin Loki completely trashed the PSP Go.
What everyone who badmouths the PSP Go needs to realize is that maybe the PSP Go is supposed to be a new PSP owner purchase and not an upgrade.
I never had a PSP before, but seeing all the stuff on PSN and the new PSP Go pushed me over the edge to get one finally.
It is a sleek portable and the sliding screen looks cool as hell.
Now, if I owned an older PSP, of course, I wouldn't buy the PSP Go the same way I wouldn't buy a DSi if I owned a Lite or a Phat.
I honestly don't think the PSP Go is even aimed at the current PSP owners, but new customers like myself.
So really, no need to take a shit on it, just don't buy it and enjoy your current PSPs.
This email is sponsored by the Olive Garden Home of the Reverending Salad and Breadsticks.
Um, I will say this, and this is me.
Okay, this is just me.
If I was a new customer and I was told to pick one to buy, if they were all the same price, I would pick the $3,000.
I wouldn't get a go.
And we've said on this show that the PSP 3000 is a great system.
It's pretty cool.
And the thing is, I don't understand why you would pay more money for a system that does less, basically.
That's my question.
I'm not even talking about people that own a PlayStation Portable already, because there's no reason that you need another system.
I don't understand that at all, why we would buy another one.
Why I said that, because I actually have two PSPs, but the 2000 actually had...
S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
The fact is, the 3000 is cheaper, it plays the same downloadable games, plus you have the option now to purchase games that are on UMD, plus you can get memory units and stuff like that for it.
Yes, it doesn't have built-in memory, but you know what?
Memory's cheap, so it's not really worth paying the extra money for memory that's in the system.
And that sliding screen may look cool and stuff, but at the same time, I'm wondering how soon that's going to break.
and, you know, I do give them credit for the fact that they have, you know, the ability to sync up your DualShock 3 controller with it to, you know, play games when you have it hooked up to your TV.
I can't say that I've actually used that function on my PSP 2000.
I mean, I've played games on TV before, but maybe once or twice to see it, you know, check it out.
I don't know, it's just... I don't understand why you would pay more money for a system that does less.
That's basically my argument.
But hey, if you want to, and if you think it's a cool looking system or whatever, more power to you, but...
I got to try one.
A guy in my art history class had one.
Well, I didn't really sit and play on anything, but he let me hold it and push the buttons.
And I have to say that it really felt flimsy.
It felt...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
I want to take a quick poll in here because I want to kind of address the Sony people for a minute because especially in reading some of the reviews on Twitter and so forth.
I'm sorry, not Twitter.
Twitter's on my mind tonight because of everything else going on, but iTunes and everything.
People have been unnecessarily harsh to our program because they think we're slanted against Sony.
And I want to make it very clear.
It's not the case.
We haze people when they deserve to be hazed.
And I want to prove that here with something.
And I'm not saying this particular emailer is a part of that because I know he's emailed us a bunch about various topics.
But I'm just saying, hold on a minute because it works both ways here.
Quick poll of the room.
How many of you own a DSi?
No, I don't.
I don't.
Exactly.
None of us own a DSi either.
And for many of the same reasons.
Because what's the difference between a DS and a DSi?
It has a camera.
It has a camera.
I'll get a DSi when there are more specific DSi games.
But other than that, there's no legitimate reason for me to have a DSi.
It's just it's got a camera with it.
And, you know, the price points are pretty similar.
But at the same time, it doesn't warrant me purchasing another system that plays the same games.
They put out a camera on the old...
Game Boy Color, guess who didn't buy one?
Me.
Eddie is saying two cameras.
But here's something else to consider.
If I remember right, the DSi got rid of the Game Boy Advance slot too.
Exactly.
So you can't play games.
So it's in a way almost just as bad as the PSP Go and the PSP 3000.
Here's my question that is not really being answered.
What do you get with the PSP Go that you don't get on the PSP 3000 that justifies the increased price?
At least in the DS world, you can say a camera, the downloadable game service, and the SD card support.
Okay, fair enough.
So you've named a couple things that you have with the DS.
And I even knocked on that.
It's not enough for me.
For me.
But for a new player, okay, now you have to weigh the pros and the cons.
Con, I don't get to play Game Boy Advance games anymore.
Pros, I get a camera, SD card slot, and downloadable games.
What do I want to do?
But with the PSP 3000 and the PSP Go...
You have to weigh.
Con.
It's more expensive and I lose the UMD.
Pro.
Chirp, chirp.
It's cuter.
It's sleeker looking and it's got Bluetooth support.
So?
That's it.
And with the DSi even, if you are purchasing a new system, you're probably not going to be able to buy any Game Boy Advance games anyways out there because they're not selling them anymore.
They haven't been selling them for a few years now.
So it's not going to be that big a deal if you can't have a Game Boy Advance slot on there to people that are just getting into the DS or whatever.
And the DSi would be a good purchase for them.
But if you have Game Boy Advance games and you have a DS...
Why would you go and buy another game system?
I'm glad to know it's not just us tonight because there's a little bit of DSI rabble-rabble going on in chat as well, but there is some comments.
SSJ100Matt says, Aside from them putting President Cat on DSI, I never see myself getting a DSI.
And Actdeft says, Matt, indeed.
President Cat on the DSI and I'll buy it instantly.
Which, by the way, I want to say...
How fucking adorable is this?
Actdeft tweeted the Rina Wee people to say, Hey, I'm in Mexico.
It's not just USA people.
I'm in Mexico, and I think you're great.
And they responded, Gracias.
How adorable.
I want to hug them all.
I do.
I want President Cat.
Aren't you going to be traveling to Japan?
I'm supposed to travel to Japan in June, yes.
In fact, I will be gone from the show for two or three weeks.
Take me with you.
You got money?
I'm going on a tour type thing, so we'll see.
Okay.
Rob, I have to teach you how to shop.
I'm going to teach you how to shop.
And ask for directions.
Teach me five-year-old Japanese.
I will teach you five-year-old Japanese.
Hey, I know five-year-old Japanese.
Alright, so anyway, if you want more emails, mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com Loki, we... Oh, I'm sorry.
Before we get into that, I'm just all off tonight.
It's alright.
It's President Cat.
It's not even just President Cat.
You know what started it all?
Oh, yes.
You thought I forgot about that, didn't you?
It's official.
DarkSakura is in the corner crying.
I was not.
I got you.
And I flip Rob off a lot.
This is just one of those shows.
You know, I was driving here tonight thinking, God, I'm tired.
This is just going to be a crappy show tonight.
Yeah, no, this is great.
I'm having a good time.
But I swear to God, if you make me sick, not even President Cat can help you where you're going to go.
President Cat.
Anyhow.
Rob, you know what I have?
What?
I have a case of meh.
Leo Shannon Chat says, Rob, I made that my new iPhone ringtone.
Awesome.
DJ Dark Knight says, Flying Shoe coming up.
Lol.
And X-Link says, I was also in the corner crying.
Those comments from our lovely chat room, chat.orangeloungeradio.com.
All right.
Well, maybe for those of you that are sick and tired of Daytona, this segment is just for you.
It's the F-Views of the Week.
Alright, so starting off tonight, the story that inspired our FUs of the Week.
Apparently a 15-year-old was set on fire this week.
And that's not cool.
You know, as much as we joke about fire, fire is to look at on the Indiana Jones ride and yell cool at or fuego.
You don't actually set people on fire.
That is not cool.
and unfortunately his poor kid Michael Brewer was set on fire and the reason why because Brewer owed one of the suspects who's been arrested US $40 for a video game this video game debt apparently made the suspect steal the father's bicycle Brewer reported the bicycle was stolen the suspect got arrested but the suspect was released from a detention center on Monday morning
and then Brewer was waiting for friends in an apartment complex.
The suspect, I guess, came up saying he's a snitch, a snitch and poured on him and they poured alcohol and lighter and yeah, gross.
So, I mean, just what a monster.
What an ass.
And over a video game debt.
and it prompted one sheriff to say in 31 years it's the most heinous crime I've ever seen.
All over $40 over a video game.
FU suspect whose name they clearly haven't released because he's a minor but they should so we can dedicate this segment to him.
DarkSakura, do you have any FUs of the week?
I'm actually just trying to verify that I was reading this properly, because they asked us what President Cat is, so I was going to say, doesn't that mean President?
Anyway, I'm about to say.
But, yeah, F you to my co-worker, who I refer to all the time as Mr. Annoying, for acting like a five-year-old baby and tattletailing on something that didn't involve him.
Loki, do you have any F's of the week?
My FQ of the week goes to Pushy Salesman.
Especially people that come door-to-door selling stuff.
Because I'm always a sucker and open the door, and I really shouldn't.
So we had a guy that we were looking for roof quotes because we need a new roof on our house.
And this guy came and gave us this sales pitch that took two hours.
And, well, he was really pushy and annoying, so...
It sucked, and if I hadn't answered the door, I wouldn't have to deal with it.
So, uh... F you to that, because I hate these people.
Um, my F you of the week just goes to, um... Gosh, I... Tonight I've laughed so hard, I'm actually not that angsty.
I guess my F you goes to, uh... Drama.
Drama!
In general.
Although, honestly, you know... Things are okay.
I can't complain too much.
Everything's better with President Cat.
It really is.
Although now we're defining out President... When the official people are saying, what's President Cat?
Clearly that is not the name of the game.
So I just tweeted him, do you have a better translation?
I see that.
Well, that's what... I copied the actual kanji over because... Was it sensential?
Mm-hmm.
It's like...
For example, there's a different word that's similar that means class president when you're in school and so-and-so president.
It's a different type of position.
And president would be the closest equivalent.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
That could be the cover of the game.
We're going to make that for the website.
I'm telling you.
We're going to do it.
I can't stress this enough.
Please upload your president cat or whatever the hell this game is called, your fan art, your whatever.
Put it on the OLR pics thing and then tweet it to this poor girl who doesn't know what the hell she just woke up to today here and show them the love.
Renna is the cat's name.
Okay.
Okay.
I got the Renna part.
Okay.
and Sancho would be, I guess, like company president?
Just call it Obama Cat and be done with it.
The game will sell millions of copies.
It'll be on Fox News about how it brainwashes kids and we'll laugh.
The one, Sukibon, I think, has to do with... I think it means something about female something.
I don't know.
I think.
Dark Tetsuya says, Top Cat...
Oh god, like Top Chef, Top Cat, I'd love that.
Alright, anyhow, let's move on with a couple more stories.
Okay, Sukeban means delinquent girl.
Interesting.
Or boss girl.
So is the game like Naughty Cat?
Oh, that would be amazing.
So, well, I knew that it had something to do with a girl, because it's like, I know characters who've been in series that have, like Sukeban Deka, it has to do with like a delinquent girl who uses a yo-yo as a weapon.
or like a female gang leader for a school gang.
So I'm guessing it's sort of like female boss Katrina or female boss Rina.
Kat's not actually in the name.
Interesting.
So...
Alright, well, if they should download the show and listen to it, just know we've decided that that should be the name of the game.
Alright.
Anyhow, a couple more news stories for you, and then the Skype line to say your piece on anything we've talked about tonight.
AkumaJP said something on Twitter, said that it means boss, cat boss.
Thank you, AkumaJP.
I'm so glad he's still listening, even though JustinTV hasn't been around for a while.
He's like the ambassador we need right now.
Plus, did you notice his little icon is him looking up just like Obama would?
Thank you, AkumaJP.
Let's get to a couple more stories and then we'll get to the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR for some stories.
Let's talk something else about... Let's see, we've got the possibility of a new DS on the horizon, which is interesting.
There's a rumor that the new NVIDIA Tegra chip is going into the next generation DS system.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Not next year, but the year after.
I don't know.
It's interesting.
It'd be interesting to see them being on the cutting edge of portable systems.
Since their systems usually kind of... I don't know.
Well, let's see.
I mean, their last system was emulating Nintendo 64 games.
So this next handheld system should be like a GameCube in my pocket.
Yeah.
Amazing.
Wait, what'd you say?
They just posted again to all of us saying, say, really, I can't believe it, kind people, I'm impressed, and great name, thank you.
So they like President Cat.
I like it too.
Chat room, quick poll.
Who would buy a game called President Cat?
And as soon as that game comes, I'm taking a picture of my cat holding the game.
We need to take a picture of Shermie with it too.
I'm telling you, we are going to flood these people with USA love because what we're doing, this poor girl or guy does not know what they're in for because we're going to flood them with this stuff so they can take it to their people and say, look, the US is crazy about President Cat.
We need to get them.
And then they'll be like, what's President Cat?
This show is the win.
Rob, when you put this show up, subtitle it President Cat.
I'm not even going to put a description.
I'm going to say, sorry, this show was dominated by President Cat.
Anyhow, let's see.
Quick response to our poll in chat room.
Do want, arrow pointing at name, I would, yo, I will, stuff on my president cat, I would, now, 10 copies, I would, my cat wants it, I will buy 100 copies.
Giovedea is buying copies for her cats.
I haven't even played my Wii in over a year, but if I can get this game, I'll break that trend.
And my favorite, from M.A.
Satsuma, president cat is purr-fect.
That's beautiful.
And you know what I'm just hoping, though, is that I'm hoping that at least this game isn't all, like, written, that there's, like, vocal track with it, because then I could play it.
Because I read, like, seriously, I read like a five-year-old.
I know my numbers in a few other countries.
I just love the action.
I'm just worried the game sucks.
I don't care at this point.
I don't care.
It doesn't matter.
I'll get this!
Uh-oh, what?
Uh, uh, Rina, uh, PodCulture, uh, Brad, Brad just became Rina Wee's 100th follower.
We doubled their followership.
I love this show.
Some days I hate it, today I love it.
I mean, seriously, okay?
Wii Music was put out by Nintendo.
Sucked balls.
Why?
Because it did not have a cat playing the piano.
And I'm sorry.
It doesn't matter.
The game is going to be awesome.
And yes, I understand it's no Metroid Prime.
It's no Conduit or whatever.
It's not even a Super Mario Galaxy.
But you know what?
It's a motherfucking cat playing a motherfucking piano.
What else do you need?
They have games out there based on Moomin, which is like some... I don't even know what it is.
It's some character from Europe somewhere.
It's just...
We need this game.
I'm sorry.
We need this game.
I agree.
We need it.
We need it.
All right.
Anyhow, one more story for you guys, then we're going to open up the Skype line, and I can't wait to get to the calls tonight.
Castlevania, The Adventure Rebirth.
More information has been announced.
This is a game, of course, heading to WiiWare.
Tonight's been a Wii-heavy show.
We haven't had a lot of Nintendo news in a long time, but yes, of course, Castlevania Adventure Rebirth.
This was one of the games that was spoiled from the ESRB database.
It is true.
Konami hasn't really announced it, but we know it's true because you know what?
It showed up in a magazine this week in Japan.
It's coming out October 27th for 1,000 Wii Points.
And hopefully it's going to come here in time, maybe for Halloween.
That's what they're thinking at this point.
It's coming out in Japan at this time.
It looks very sexy.
It's a Game Boy game originally, but they just completely remade it.
It's now in color.
It looks a little more to me like the 16-bit era.
It looks like the Castlevania 4, Super Castlevania 4.
But like...
I don't know.
This is going to be cool.
It will have new arrangements of classic Castlevania music.
Yes!
And like the other Rebirth games that they did, they are going for a faithful 16-bit look.
What are you screaming laughing about there, DarkSakura?
I'm just looking at all of the last 50 followers of Reno E. And it's all of us.
I love it.
I love it.
Anyhow.
Can we move on?
I'm sorry, this is fantastic.
No, it's funny.
Tonight has just been a very special show, and it's about to get more specialer, as if there was such a thing.
1-877-GAME-OLR is the Skype line, or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
Let's get to the calls.
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
Who's this?
This is DSMaster26.
DSMaster, we're asking everybody tonight, President Cat, is it awesome or are we overdoing it?
Yes, I would buy it.
I would too.
Alright, what's on your mind tonight?
Oh shit, Skype crashed again.
Son of a bitch.
Skype did that last week too, didn't it?
Bad Skype.
Alright, well, this is when this is one of those rare cases where we will actually call somebody back because he did get through fair and square so we're gonna call him.
I don't know what the hell Skype did this last week too, remember?
It's just being retarded.
TigerClaw asks if I've updated it.
You know what?
I probably haven't, especially not tonight because we ran in studio very late tonight.
Hi, DSMaster, are you back?
Yeah, sorry.
I think it's something with my PSP.
No, no, it's us.
I'm going to try to log in to my 3000 call you.
Hello?
DSMaster, it's us.
Skype crashed on our end.
What's on your mind?
Oh, it's your end?
Yeah, it was our end.
What's on your mind tonight?
Not much other than I will buy President Cat when it comes out.
Me too.
Other than that, I'm here to review... My friend got an early copy of 16 Empress.
Please, go for it.
It's epic.
Tell us a little bit about the game.
Tell us a little bit about the game for those that don't know, because remember, not everybody that listens to this show is from the Bomani days.
Well, we were kind of thinking, since this is going to be the last Beatmania for PS2, we might as well get it.
and of course I don't have the phone of cash lying around so my friend bought it and so he showed me some videos and whatever and I thought this was kind of cool and now with DJ Hero coming out, the question is is that going to be the competition in Konami to run for their money along with Scratch DJ?
Do you think this is going to
you know, blow off the Beatmania fans to go get
The two games really aren't competing against each other.
I know a lot of the Bonnie community wants to think it is, but they're really not.
Because we all know that DJ Hero will come out in Japan soon, because Guitar Hero is out in Japan, I mean, as far as the on-tour games, as far as I know.
That would be true, I'll give you that.
And some of me is thinking, this is the competition for the guitar freaks, drum manias, and especially with rock band out there now, too.
I mean, Konami tried Rock Revolution, that was a crapshoot, as we all know.
And this, I think, may be their final nail in the coffin.
It doesn't say when it's going to be out over there, but it says October 2009 is the release date for DJ Hero over there, so it very well could be coming out around the same time, although, I don't know.
Alright, well, DS Master, do you have anything else quickly before we let you go?
Um, other than to say, I give 16 Empress, you know, since I'm a factor, it's probably the last beat me for the PS2, because I'm waiting for a PS3 launch before I actually buy one of those consoles.
Um,
I, it's, in the point of President Cat, it's purr-fect.
It is purr-fect.
And Skype just crashed again.
So if you can hear me.
Hello?
Yeah.
Um, Skype crashed again.
I don't know what the hell is going on tonight, but Skype crashed again.
So, sorry to DSMaster26, but at least he got his thoughts out.
So, live radio, unfortunately, this kind of stuff's gonna happen.
We got another reply from Rena Wee.
What happened now?
She says she is a bit of the queen type.
So maybe it's Queen Cat?
Queen Cat.
I don't know if Queen... I think President Cat has a better ring to it.
Or Boss Cat.
Or Boss Cat?
The boss of the cats in the house.
Almost like Top Cat.
But if you saw these games on the shelf, which one would jump out to you?
I think President Cat would jump out to you.
That shows a little bit of the U.S.
flair to it, right?
Because in Japan, they don't have a president.
They have a prime minister, correct?
Yeah, but I think that if it comes to representing the game, because you're not actually being a president president, but, you know.
Anyway.
Hi, this is Ray Iannami.
Sorry, I thought it held up.
I'm gonna have been, I just didn't really join until Part B since I was busy with homework and such.
Oh, okay, well then we'll give you a bye.
Well, what's on your mind tonight?
So, I've been looking at the 2D shooters, like, this decade, and I've been noticing a recent trend.
Like, they need to have, like, a bullet hell shooter with lots of cutesy enemy characters.
And it's kind of getting me worried about the 2D shooter genre.
Mm-hmm.
This means that more traditional shooters with starship characters are being phased out and I have friends who are mostly into stuff like Toho and Strike Witches and Death's Mouth and all those other moe it, moe it shooters and I have a feeling that if I were to show them something like Archive or Thunder Force they'd probably say no.
and one offer them playing whatever they want.
It makes you realize in the future if all you're ever going to see a shooter is going to be nothing but cutesy bullet hole shooters that are all like copping topics of each other.
Let's say you were a game designer.
What would you do to make a 2D shooter interesting?
Interesting as in like get people to imitate
Like, if I was making a shooter that was more of the aforementioned traditional shooter, like, how to make it more interesting?
I'm sorry, I missed that.
What?
What do you mean by how to make a shooter interesting?
Well, I know... Like, because, you know, you kind of are saying that a lot of the games are kind of copies of each other, so what would you do to kind of break the mold?
Hmm...
Well, as I mentioned, I want to make more shooters that don't have lots of worlds, but something that makes the game challenging, other than really pretty board patterns.
Something that's more of a comeback to a more traditional sort of graduate rebirth.
Gradius Rebirth is pretty cool.
I like these Rebirth series that Konami's doing recently.
Did you just hear us talking about Castlevania Rebirth?
Yeah, I did.
What do you think of that?
Is that going to be interesting?
I know it's not a shooter, but I figure you're a fan of that series too.
Yeah, I'm a Castlevania fan too.
I've played most of the Metroidvania and some of the older Castlevania games.
I'm going to give it a shot.
It depends on what element it decides to borrow from past games.
Take care, buddy.
1-877-GAME-OLR, username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
We're going to take your calls right now.
And, of course, we are polling all the callers tonight about President Cat.
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
Who's this?
Hi, this is Spazinator.
Hey, Spazinator.
How you doing?
Oh, pretty good.
How's everything over in President Catland?
Yes, wonderful.
And we have to ask you, are you interested in buying President Cat or are we making too big of a deal out of it?
Um, I might get it, assuming that I ever do get a Wii.
Um, you know, the Wii's only, you know, our current console, our current console I don't have yet, but I may get a Wii just for President Cat.
Alright, I'm just going to put you down to see yes.
Alright, uh, what's on your mind tonight?
Oh, yeah, I don't know if you saw one of my earlier tweets today before your show went live, but, um, I had asked, uh,
The three of you, if you have seen Detuned on the PlayStation Network store yet.
I have not seen this, but I know you were tweeting some things about it.
What's this all about?
It simply puts like a cross between Lingering Shadows, which has been on the store for forever, and Music Visualizer, so
It's kind of both or two things together and that's what Detuned is.
It's not actually a game, it's like part art, part music visualizer.
And like any other game, like a game for the PS3, it also has trophies.
So if you're kind of like bored of your music visualizers on the PS3,
and, you know, you need something else to look at.
If you're a trophy whore, then I suggest getting it detuned.
Is there a demo that I can check out?
Not yet, but I would imagine that probably they may come up with one soon.
When exactly, I don't know.
I'm trying to see if maybe there's like a YouTube or something I can kind of check out here.
I'm looking, I actually just loaded up somebody's video that looks like they shot their TV to show this game.
And I'm trying to look at a little bit of the game in action here.
So I can kind of see what it looks like.
But this looks like a very... Oh, this looks crazy.
Dude, there's like elephant... Maybe President Cat needs to go to PlayStation Network.
Seriously, if this game's on it, I don't know.
Yeah, uh, and also, um, the only thing I mentioned in the same tweet is that I know you kind of talked on it earlier, and I know you're not exactly that action-y, platform-y type of gamer, but, you know, um, Uncharted 2 is, uh, one of the more recent games that I got, and I swear to God, it is pretty good, um,
and um you know you know you know if you like um you know the Indiana Jones type type of uh stuff you know you know I would suggest getting it um you know you know you're seeing that uh every uh you know major company out there that does uh
The reviews gave it basically perfect.
I know, I saw it.
The reviews are nothing but positive.
I'm sure the game's great.
It's just, you know, I don't usually play those type of games.
But I probably will check it out right after I get President Cat, okay?
Sure.
All right.
Take care, buddy.
We're going to let you go so we can get some more calls.
Have a good one.
I have to hear that.
Yes, you too.
Later.
1877 Game OLR.
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
Who's this?
It's Legend of Zaku.
Zaku, you know what I'm going to ask you first.
President Cat, yay or nay?
DeVirginized
Um, let's say, um, I had to fake an orgasm.
Nice.
That's pretty standard.
That's, yeah, I've actually seen the show in New York.
At least you didn't have to do the, at least you didn't have to do the Twinkie or Banana Blowjob.
Did you, uh, did you have a good time?
It was pretty good, to be honest with you.
So, yeah, aside from that, I'm just, you know, just like mulling over the things.
you know, the bullshit decision that Infinity Ward made over the weekend regarding Modern Warfare 2 PC and what's that?
killing off dedicated servers basically making the whole game a living hell for clans and the ability to mob the hell out of it
This seems to be a trend this year with PC games.
The only reason why I say that is because remember what a hizzy fit everybody went into over StarCraft 2?
You can't play on LANs right now?
It seems like all these game companies want to centralize things on their own servers for various reasons.
Well, it's not even that.
It's just that they're introducing matchmaking as an integral part of Modern Warfare 2.
Basically, bringing it down to the level...
XBOX 5
and you know basically kills off any aspect of gaming playing against like more than 16 people at the same time and I mean the fact of the matter is that dedicated servers pretty much has always been the norm for PC games for the most part I mean growing up playing on like Quake 2 for example on dedicated servers and the
I don't know, I guess they're going ass-backwards.
I guess Infinity Ward's trying to, like, being, like, regressive regarding this.
And it's pissing off a lot of people.
A lot of people are canceling their pre-orders.
So, either that or they're being kept in the dark.
My God, are you tearing your computer apart during the show?
No, no, no, no, no.
I mean, I was going to get Modern Warfare 2, but after reading this, I'm kind of questioning that thought.
That notion of actually investing in that game.
It's tough for me, Zaku, because you know Modern Warfare isn't the type of game I would usually play.
But, you know, obviously I know it's going to be epic, especially for fans of that genre.
I'm not going to knock it because it sets trends.
But I can see where people are getting a little irritated.
But really, you're going to go without the game completely when it's going to be probably this year's biggest game?
I understand that it's supposed to be Halo and all the other...
Subtitles by the Amara.org community
It kind of turns me off.
I mean, I went through the same thing when playing Call of Duty 4 on 360.
It was just a lot of asshattery and it just didn't feel right when I should be playing that game on my PC with a decent server where everyone at least knows who you are.
Alright.
Zaku, any quick thoughts before we move on to some more calls?
Infinity Ward needs to either
Release more information or just like really rethink about what they just said about what they're planning to do.
Because they already lost one sale out of probably thousands, if not millions.
At least that's money you can invest in a present cap.
All right.
Take care, Saku.
Have a good night.
Have a good one.
Speaking of President Cat, the updates keep coming.
They're trying to explain to us what it is.
And basically, they tweeted us to this Google image search.
Hey, that's you.
It shows us what the Tsukibon is.
That was Yo-Yo Cop Girl.
Well, that's completely mistranslated.
Tsukibon, that's a word I knew.
Because, like I said, it means a boss girl.
And that's the typical look.
Okay, Rob, did you ever play Project Justice?
No.
Okay.
Well, there's a character in that called Zaki who wore the long skirt and everything with her uniform and it's like a girl gang leader.
So, maybe they need to call the game Mistress Cat, because these look like a mistress.
But I just like the name President Cat, and I do want to point out, in all these pictures, look at the colors the Tsukibon are wearing.
Red, white, and blue.
Am I right?
Am I right?
That's just typical uniform colors, though.
Coincidence or not, it's funny and adds to the cause.
I still like the name President Cat.
At any rate, I think the best way to describe the title of the game, because...
It's basically, we've been going, and I said, oh, she controls the house, and they were going, no, she controls the office.
So I think it's like, she is sort of like the real leader of the office, you know what I mean?
Like, Shermie's the real princess of the house.
She inserts her own control over the house.
More calls at 1-877-GAME-OLR.
Loki, do you have any last minute stories?
I see you looking at something about...
Oh, I was just doing a search for the cat thing, and there's someone talking about it.
They thought it was a Dreamcast game.
It's the NTSC-UK forums.
We're talking about the cat game.
They call it the Dreamcast cat game because it has a little Dreamcast swirl on it.
Spirals on our cheeks for the blush.
Well, did you respond and say it's fucking President Cat?
Now, salute.
No, I didn't say that.
However, I did notice that there was someone that posted on the GameFAQs forum, the only post, I suspect, Actdeft, that said, President Cat for 2012, you know you want or something.
I love that idea.
Go flood the GameFAQs forums with President Cat love.
That is the most awesome Tsukibandeka picture ever.
And I understand that, you know, President Cat isn't necessarily what it translates into, but, you know, bossy or authoritative female cat just doesn't have the same ring as President Cat.
And the president of a company, CEO Cat, I mean... Yeah, exactly.
I think President Cat has the best ring to it.
You could do Company President Cat.
I don't think we're getting any other calls Grand Empress Kat
All right.
Loki, do you have any last-minute stories?
Yes.
So just like they did with the NHL, EA is bringing Madden NFL Arcade to Xbox Live Arcade and PlayStation Network.
It will be a five-on-five football game with kind of like a backyard scenario.
They say the first of 30, four plays per progression, no penalties, no field goals.
And that will be coming for $15 sometime in December.
Okay.
Also, Nice America wants to bring Holy Invasion of Privacy Badman to UMD.
Ironically enough, this game was originally going to come out in UMD, but for whatever reason, it got cock-blocked into download only.
But they're looking for a thousand fans to basically promise that they're going to pre-order the game.
And if you do that, by November 13th, they will bring out the game.
Interesting.
Yes.
Apparently, third-party publishers are not required to release PSP games on the PlayStation Store.
All the more reason that you have the option of buying a UMD game, and that's why you need to own a PSP 3000 and not a Go.
You're just limiting your options.
Finally, Borderlands, a game that hasn't even come out yet, is already getting its first bit of download content, almost kind of tying in with
S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
Yeah, later this year they say.
Interesting.
is the rumored date.
Also, in related news, I think this was something that was briefly covered on a previous show.
The Cleveland fan John Thompson, also known as Big Dog, had recently sued EA because EA used his likeness in Madden NFL.
He's one of the super fans that actually dresses up as a dog for the games.
Yeah, I can't really explain it either, but I'm assuming if you follow football or live in Cleveland, you know what I'm talking about.
He has settled the suit, apparently, $25,000.
So, there you go.
I'm sorry, the suit has been settled not necessarily for $25,000.
That is what he was seeking originally, but we don't know exactly how much it was settled for.
So there you go.
And that's going to do it for Last Minute Stories tonight.
No other calls on Skype line tonight, so I guess that's it.
We just have shy callers tonight.
So that's going to do it, I guess, for tonight's episode of Orange Launch Radio.
Thank you guys so much for tuning in to us and supporting our show.
I know it was a crazy-ass show tonight, but you know what?
It was fun.
It was a lot of fun.
But I'm just waiting for the backlash to begin on President Cat, but you're a fool if you don't support it.
Let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts.
Oh, hey, hey, guess what?
Oh god, more?
Yeah.
Renowee says, yeah, I like to and I think President Cat is better.
So they like President Cat.
So now I've got a goal to make President Cat a trending topic on...
On Twitter Good luck with that, it takes a lot It takes a lot to get a trending topic But I think the more we can show Again, I'm totally serious about Let's use our picture stream for something really useful Send in President Cat fan art Something that we can send to them So they can show people That's how this is going to happen They have to be able to prove to some American publisher That America actually wants this game And that it's not a fucking joke You know what?
I think we need to start a Shermie blog
I'm serious!
Shermie needs a Twitter.
Shermie needs a Twitter.
Shermie's gonna be, like, well, no, you know, they have their little blog for their president, for, um, for their, uh, for Renna, yeah, who was, like, the boss cat and all the other, seriously, I was just reading this one about this other cat going, oh, you know.
So it'll be Shermie's goal to get President Cat out in the US.
Yeah.
And he, she can be, uh, Shermie can be Secretary of Fat.
S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
You haven't heard the last of President Cat.
We finally found a cause here on Orange Lounge Radio.
One of several causes, I'm sure.
Oh, we got one more call coming through on the Skype line.
Let's take a call.
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
Who's this?

Oh, we didn't get everybody's final thought.

DarkSakura, did you have anything else you wanted to add?
My final thought is President Cat for 2012.
Actually, 2010.
We need President Cat a lot sooner.
Governor Cat in 2010.
We need President Cat to take over the mafia.
All right.
That's going to do it.
Thank you guys so much for downloading and supporting Internet Radio.
President Cat.
President Cat, indirectly.
Look, guys, honestly, I said it before and I meant it.
There's millions of shows talking about Uncharted 2 this week, and we're certainly not hating on the game by any means.
We're just like you.
We don't get paid.
Did somebody put that on our Twitter?
IkumaJP put a picture of a kitten dressed up as a sukeban, so I'm going to post that on our Twitter.
Okay.
Not the Twitter, but on... Place that in chat so our chatters can see, please.
Thank you.
God damn, the show's amazing tonight.
Alright, thank you guys.
Honestly, I meant it when I said it earlier, you know, and we're certainly not hating on Uncharted 2 by any means.
We're just like you.
We have to pay $60 of our own money if we want to play the game.
They don't send us this stuff for free, so we'll get to those stuff eventually.
