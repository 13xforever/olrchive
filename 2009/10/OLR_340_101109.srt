With your hosts, DarkSakura, Sky and Loco

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Tonight, October 11th, 2009, Epic Mickey is confirmed this week as a real game.

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Could you soon see the Wii Balance Board used in airport security?

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
And the Commodore 64 Classic is set for a new revival.

Orange Lounge Radio

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Hello everybody out there on the internet, on their iPods, on allgames.com or however you're listening to our show.

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

9
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:46,000
We are that show dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture and the gamer lifestyle.

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
We like to think of ourselves as the show where every gamer has a voice.

11
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
With you here every week is myself, Rob Roberts.

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
And joining me as always, say hello to the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.

13
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
You.

14
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
How are you doing, DarkSakura?

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I'm doing.

16
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Good, good to hear.

17
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Yeah, and guess what?

18
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
What?

19
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I don't have to work tomorrow.

20
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Lucky you.

21
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Who celebrates Columbus Day anymore?

22
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Banks, apparently.

23
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Colombians.

24
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Alright, anyway, also joining us, say hello to TechMaster, Loki.

25
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Hello.

26
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
How you doing, Loki?

27
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I'm doing good.

28
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Awesome.

29
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
How was your couple weeks off?

30
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Because you missed the show, the mini show we did.

31
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
We talked about that before.

32
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
That I guess you just kind of spaced it on Tuesday.

33
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
I forgot.

34
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Yeah, right.

35
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I had crap going on on Tuesday, so I forgot all about it.

36
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
So we pre-recorded so that, you know, because it's been weird.

37
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
We've missed a couple weeks, and that's all my fault, I apologize.

38
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,000
But we pre-recorded a show for last week, and Loki, you just kind of didn't come.

39
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Yeah, I spaced.

40
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
You were better than that show.

41
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Sorry.

42
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
What did you get done last Saturday, or last Sunday in Absence of Orange on radio?

43
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I put in sprinklers.

44
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Yeah?

45
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Yeah, that was not fun.

46
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
But it's done?

47
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Do they work?

48
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Yeah, it's done.

49
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
They work.

50
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Good, because our sprinklers need fixing.

51
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I just have to bury them, which I haven't...

52
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
I finished most of it.

53
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,000
There's a part by the valves at the bury and the side yard at the bury.

54
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Gotcha.

55
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
But I haven't really...

56
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I don't know.

57
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I need...

58
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Because, you know, when you're digging that stuff out, especially if you dig it out onto

59
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:19,000
grass and stuff like that, you end up losing some of the dirt because you just can't scrape

60
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
all of it out of the grass.

61
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,000
So there's like big divots where all the pipes are.

62
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,000
And at the same time, we also chop through the cable line, which is fun.

63
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
So we had to fix that too.

64
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
But, yeah, they went in.

65
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
They work.

66
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I ran them today trying to flush out the water because now our water out of our fridge tastes

67
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
like crap.

68
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Well, you know, city water.

69
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
That's what it tastes like.

70
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:48,000
So, you know, we need to flush out the water out of the pipes and stuff and get it all

71
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
clean, and then everything will be fine.

72
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
All right.

73
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Well, it's really good to be back.

74
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Let me just tell you guys because honestly, and I was commenting to Dark Sakura before

75
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
we started tonight's show, it feels like we've been gone for like a year.

76
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,000
I don't know what it is about having missed a couple of shows here and there, but I just

77
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,000
want to reassure everybody, we are set to go through the rest of 2009.

78
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
No foreseeable vacations.

79
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I mean, of course, you know, things are going to happen, who knows what.

80
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
But no foreseeable vacations for the rest of the year.

81
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
We're here with you guys.

82
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:21,000
And podcast feed should be all good again soon, very soon.

83
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:26,000
We've got the episode from a few weeks ago up and getting that all caught up, so we'll

84
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
be good to go very soon.

85
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
So let's get back into it.

86
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
How was your gaming week is how we always start off the show.

87
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Dark Sakura, how was your gaming week?

88
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Not very.

89
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Yeah, really?

90
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Well, I sat around watching Dan play through Shadow Complex, which is pretty cool.

91
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:48,000
And I don't know, I didn't play too much myself, except I didn't even play any Sims.

92
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I was just, meh.

93
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
But wait a minute.

94
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I played Peggle.

95
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Well, hold on a minute.

96
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Rewind a minute.

97
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Because you were telling me before the show started tonight, and I even noticed the background

98
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
on your computer.

99
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
It's a game I want.

100
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I didn't play it.

101
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Oh, I thought it was something you were watching Dan play.

102
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
No, we were watching a comparison for Bayonetta.

103
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:13,000
We were watching an Xbox 360 and PS3 side-by-side comparison.

104
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
PS3 version looks like shit.

105
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Yeah, they're really distancing themselves from it.

106
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
It's awful.

107
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Oh, the bunnies are out.

108
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Interesting.

109
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Rob, look out the window.

110
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Yeah, I saw them last week.

111
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Bunnies?

112
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
In the neighbor's yard.

113
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Wow.

114
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Sorry.

115
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
I heard a rooster earlier, and now bunnies.

116
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Are we out on a farm today or something?

117
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Well, our neighbors across the street, they let their bunnies run wild all over the neighborhood.

118
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
And they usually like to hang out in my yard.

119
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
So, we have stray bunnies.

120
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Gotcha.

121
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
And not stray dogs or cats.

122
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
We have stray bunnies.

123
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
You been watching Dan play more ODST?

124
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
That game makes me motion sick, and I don't really care for it.

125
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Gotcha.

126
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
I'm like, ugh, turn off this loud piece of crap.

127
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:00,000
But Dan loves it, so if he's having fun with it, then he can have fun, just not when I'm

128
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
trying to go to bed.

129
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
And just for folks who are newer to the show who may not know, you've never been a fan

130
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
of first-person shooters, because they just make you ill.

131
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Well, I'd like them before they used 3D.

132
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
When they were sprite-based, great.

133
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Like Wolfenstein was fine, right?

134
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Yeah, and Doom.

135
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Alright.

136
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Well, let's move on.

137
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Loki, how was your gaming week?

138
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
My gaming week was pretty good, I guess.

139
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:29,000
I played more Grand Theft Auto, Lost and Damned, where I'm up to almost rank 5.

140
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:35,000
I would have been ranked 5 on Friday, but I dropped out of one of my games.

141
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:41,000
And I had to go on some manager special event thing or something, so I went to a zoo instead.

142
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:48,000
But no, I'm like $500 away from rank 5, which means I get more heads, as my coworker likes

143
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
to put it.

144
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:54,000
And it's just killing time for a couple more weeks until Ballad of Gay Tony comes out,

145
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
and that'll be awesome.

146
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,000
And then, what was it, my sister's 360 died, so now...

147
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:06,000
And it's funny, hers died the same way as my last one did, where it basically lost its

148
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:12,000
graphics processor, got like a green tint to it, and then the whole thing, just no video

149
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
anymore, so that kind of sucked.

150
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,000
There's no real way to fix that, and obviously it's not under warranty since hers is modded

151
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
as well, so that doesn't work.

152
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,000
But we have a way to remedy that soon enough.

153
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:34,000
And then I played some DJ Hero, I have a demo unit that I got, and I've been playing the

154
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:39,000
four songs that are on there, well three technically in the set, and then there's a fourth one

155
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:47,000
which is like a DJ versus guitar song in there, which I didn't really play that much of because

156
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
not a lot of people wanted to play guitar.

157
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:57,000
And then, been having a lot of fun with that, you know, the controller's pretty nice, although

158
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:02,000
since it is a demo unit, it's wired and wireless, which is fine, I don't really give a crap,

159
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
because I hate replacing batteries anyways.

160
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:09,000
And the only thing that sucks about those, you can't flip it because the way the cord

161
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:15,000
comes out, it actually would be in the way if you flipped it to the left-handed, I guess

162
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:20,000
lefty side, although for me, I don't really care because I'm right-handed, but my coworker

163
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:25,000
wasn't, and he wanted to really try it, and I'm like, dude, sorry, can't, so he had to

164
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
play cross-handed.

165
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Tell us a little bit, because you know, obviously Orange Highlands Radio started as a music

166
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:35,000
game thing, and on our very first episode of Orange Highlands Radio, we had people in

167
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:40,000
house playing BeatMania 2DX, so it's very interesting now coming here seven and a half

168
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
years later, now we're going to have people in the studio playing DJ Hero tonight.

169
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:50,000
How do the two games compare, if at all, what are Bomani fans going to think of DJ Hero?

170
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:55,000
They may not like it, because it's nothing like 2DX, it's more like Guitar Hero, I mean

171
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:00,000
it's just like the comparison of 2DX and Guitar Hero, they're really not similar at all,

172
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,000
I mean other than you have notes coming down the screen, but that's about it.

173
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:12,000
The scratching in the game is almost like strumming on the guitar a little bit, and

174
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:19,000
then the crossfader, it's a lot of, I mean, when you start playing it, it's a lot to

175
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:26,000
kind of take all in, but then you get used to it, and it can be hard to juggle the crossfader

176
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:32,000
and the keys and all that stuff sometimes, but it's fun, and I don't know, I enjoy

177
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:38,000
the game a lot, there's some songs I saw on the full track list I'm not too excited

178
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,000
about, I mean there's especially a lot of songs that are just kind of repeats as far

179
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
as what they've used to mix them together, but you know what, I think it'll actually

180
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:52,000
sound very different, just like I've listened to the two Shout remixes, and they're completely

181
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:58,000
different, it's just, it's going to be fun, definitely, and as far as playing it, it's

182
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,000
pretty easy to kind of pick up and start, but if you're good at Guitar Hero, I mean

183
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:06,000
you're still going to have trouble with it, because I had a friend who's, you know,

184
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:11,000
he can expert almost all the songs in Guitar Hero, and he was struggling just to kind of

185
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:16,000
get DJ Hero down, but it's kind of a new learning curve, but you'll pick it up pretty

186
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:21,000
quick, I mean, just from watching the videos, I started off playing Medium, and I picked

187
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:25,000
it up pretty quick, I kind of want to try hard, I haven't gotten a chance to do that

188
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:30,000
yet, because also the demo too kind of sucks, because you can't calibrate it, because

189
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:37,000
it is a demo, and so on the TV we're playing, there's some lag, and so trying to fix that,

190
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
you know, you kind of have to compensate for it.

191
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
But in the full version, you will be able to get it.

192
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Yeah, in the full version, they'll have all that stuff, it's just, you know, because

193
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:47,000
it's just a basic demo, they don't have that built in.

194
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Now, this game's going to cost $130, right?

195
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,000
$120, sorry, I think it's $120.

196
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Well, after tax, $130.

197
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
$130, yeah.

198
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Let's be real, so this game's going to set you back about $130.

199
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Who should drop, I mean, that's a big investment, I mean, for $70 more you can buy a console,

200
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:09,000
for $20 more you can buy a Wii, that's as much as a Nintendo DS.

201
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Who should drop $130 on this game?

202
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Who should not drop $130 on this game?

203
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:17,000
I think if you like music games, you should drop the money, I mean, but the thing is,

204
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:21,000
you can go to Source now, I mean, Best Buy, I know some Best Buys have this demo unit

205
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:25,000
set up, I'm sure a lot of them will be getting it if they don't have it yet, GameStop did

206
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,000
a thing this weekend where their stores had a demo unit in-house.

207
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Dark Sakura?

208
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:33,000
I was going to say, don't drop the money on this game if you're on food stamps.

209
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Well, duh, Dark Sakura, I mean, yeah, if it's not in your budget, then it's not in your

210
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
budget, but I mean, if, you know, you're debating.

211
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Yeah, and the other thing you've got to understand is, unlike, you know, Guitar Hero and Rockband,

212
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:52,000
this controller's only going to work with, you know, this game.

213
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
So far?

214
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:57,000
So far, I mean, it's not going to work, you know, Harmonix is not going to come out with

215
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:01,000
a DJ game that's going to be exactly like this, and so, you're not going to have, you

216
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:07,000
know, uniformity that way, so, you know, you've got to be really willing to stick to this

217
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:11,000
series, and you know what, I, after playing the three songs in there, I'm fine with dropping

218
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:17,000
the money, and I'll be honest, you know, I know a lot of people frown upon buying demos,

219
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:22,000
but yes, I bought this demo unit, and yes, it's the same one that you saw on Destructoid,

220
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:27,000
I bought that unit, I paid the money to buy it, and yeah, I know it's retarded, but I

221
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:33,000
had nefarious intentions, trust me, originally, but having played it, I probably am going

222
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:38,000
to buy the full game, only because I can get it early, and that's really why I'm excited

223
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:43,000
to play this game, but if I wanted to, I could, you know, pirate it, but I'm not going to,

224
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,000
because I won't play it early.

225
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:50,000
I wasn't going to say anything about how you got this game, because most people would assume

226
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
you get it through your work channels, but...

227
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
No, no, my work doesn't hook me up for crap.

228
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:59,000
What possessed you to drop that money on it?

229
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Because I wanted to play it.

230
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Because I'm impatient, and because I figured, I figured, hey, you know what, I can drop

231
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:13,000
the money on this demo unit, and the controller works just fine, and you know what, I have

232
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:19,000
the means to play modded games on my console, so if I really want to not spend the money,

233
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
I can do that.

234
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Only you can tell you how to spend your money, and the wife now, because that's part of the

235
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,000
whole marriage thing, but hopefully she liked it too.

236
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:33,000
She hasn't really seen it, she's just like, I don't know, she laughed because Hollaback

237
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Roll is in there, in the demo, but I don't care, you know, because if I don't want to

238
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:44,000
buy the game, I can still play the game, technically, but I'm not condoning piracy or anything,

239
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:48,000
and not a lot of people would be pirating this game anyway, since, you know, you need

240
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
a controller.

241
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
You need a controller for it, yeah.

242
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Alright, let me go to our chat room.

243
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000
We always have the chat comments here, chat.orangelaungeradio.com.

244
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:01,000
But for the record, though, I am buying the game on top of this, so I have two controllers,

245
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
you know, for party situations and stuff like that.

246
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:07,000
And, actually, I want to lead into our first chat comment tonight from our chat room that

247
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,000
kind of gets into this a little bit, and our first chat comment tonight comes from our

248
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,000
buddy Derek H., who actually hosts another show here on allgames.com, Dead Pixel Live,

249
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:18,000
which would technically be the next show on After Orange Launch Radio, just, you have

250
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
to wait until Monday.

251
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Derek H. says, "$130, it's catch-22.

252
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:27,000
To be worth it, you'd need to have a lot of friends, but if you have a lot of friends,

253
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,000
you're not a person who spends $130 on a video game."

254
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,000
I don't know, though, what about, I mean, I get the funny he's trying to make there,

255
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
but what about, like, Rock Band?

256
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Rock Band's a party game.

257
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Rock Band, you know, and it's, I don't know, I looked at it, you know, I thought about

258
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
it, but I went with it.

259
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
I went for it, and you know what, I'm not regretting it.

260
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
I like playing it.

261
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,000
But didn't you, it sounds like you had people over to play this game.

262
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Well, I work, yeah, we checked it out and stuff like that, and, you know, I had it hooked

263
00:13:53,000 --> 00:14:00,000
up for an entire day and that kind of thing, but, yeah, it's fun, and I am looking forward

264
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:07,000
to, and really, I could, I could just skip paying the extra $200, or $100, I'm not buying

265
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:11,000
the Renegade Edition, that's for sure, because I have a bag to carry this, you know, system

266
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:16,000
in, and you know what, I don't really need a table to play it on, because I played it

267
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:21,000
in my lap just fine, so don't buy it, especially if you don't like rap music like me.

268
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:26,000
I'm not really huge into hip hop and rap music, so, not for me.

269
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:32,000
But, yeah, I am playing and picking it up, because I'm hoping I get it about a week or

270
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
two early, so.

271
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,000
So there, now your day job comes into play.

272
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Yeah, that's where it comes in.

273
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
So don't say they don't do crap, because you've got lots of games that way.

274
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Yeah, but they don't give it to me for free, and I have to buy that crap.

275
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
All right, fair enough.

276
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
All right, so that was your gaming week.

277
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,000
All right, we spent a lot of time talking about DJ Hero, but hey, the game's not out

278
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
for, what, two weeks?

279
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Yeah, and it's 27th, I also want to say I finished my cabinet almost, I've been working

280
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:04,000
on that constantly since I've gotten it, and just today, around 3 o'clock, I finished

281
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:08,000
putting it all back together and everything, and, you know, played a little bit of New

282
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Mario on there, and it works awesome.

283
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:17,000
It's just, I have everything done except for I need to modify the kick harness on there

284
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:23,000
to hook up to what I've got for MAME, and then also have to get two new locks for under

285
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:31,000
the control panel, because the ones I bought are too short, and then also need to move

286
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
it in the house.

287
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Oh, and install Windows and stuff onto my actual PC, because I actually had to custom

288
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:43,000
build the PC to mount it on this piece of wood and stuff, so I actually made my own

289
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
power buttons and stuff like that.

290
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
It's ridiculous.

291
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:50,000
But I have pictures online, and there's pictures posted in chat.

292
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Look at that.

293
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Within seconds, Tiger Claw and SSA100MAT have pictures up.

294
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:59,000
It's pretty, it looks prettier in the picture than it does in real life, but yeah, all the

295
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
buttons have been replaced.

296
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Wait, so you just posted these today?

297
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
I just posted them this afternoon.

298
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Oh, I haven't seen this yet.

299
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
I haven't checked live during the day, so I haven't seen it.

300
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
I painted it black, and it looks awesome.

301
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Wow.

302
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Yeah, it's slick.

303
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Nice.

304
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:15,000
So you can see there, I had to drill three more holes for additional buttons, and then

305
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,000
if you scroll all the way to the bottom there, you can see-

306
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Why did you make a mess of your garage?

307
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Oh, the garage is a mess, yeah.

308
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
I remember when you moved in, that was pristine.

309
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Okay, sorry.

310
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
I just, no.

311
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
So I had to drill new buttons, but that's the PC right there.

312
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,000
It's a huge, but it's all mounted to a piece of wood.

313
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,000
I had to make custom buttons and stuff like that.

314
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,000
I will post this to our Twitter feed if you're okay with that.

315
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Oh, I'm fine.

316
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
I already posted a link to my Twitter.

317
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Folks listening on the podcast can go back and check that out if they want to see it.

318
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Very cool.

319
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Some questions from chat.

320
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Tigerclaw wants to know, so you mounted a motherboard to it.

321
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
What about cooling?

322
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Are there any vents on the back, an extra amount of fans?

323
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
No, I don't think that I really need all that stuff.

324
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:58,000
I mean, the cabinet's pretty open in the inside anyways.

325
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:02,000
I mean, there's a fan on the processor, fan on the graphics card, but I don't think it's

326
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,000
going to get too hot because I'm really not...

327
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:09,000
I mean, MAME, I don't think it's going to strain that processor too much.

328
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
So we'll see.

329
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,000
If I need to put a fan in there, I can.

330
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
But, I mean, I don't know.

331
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
I don't think it needs it.

332
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
I think it'll be fine.

333
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
But we'll play it by ear, you know.

334
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
All right.

335
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
I just put that on the Twitter, by the way.

336
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
So there you go.

337
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Anything else, Loki?

338
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
That's it.

339
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
All right.

340
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
My gaming week.

341
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
I've actually had some time to play some games this week.

342
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,000
I just want to point this out, and I know I'm going to get criticized by a lot of folks.

343
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,000
I still haven't fixed the 360.

344
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
I kind of don't need to right now.

345
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:43,000
I've totally been happy in my gaming world with World of Warcraft, of course, and PlayStation

346
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
3.

347
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:50,000
I hate to admit it because we've been so critical of Sony for a long time, but when Sony does

348
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,000
things right, I think we should admit when they've done things right.

349
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:57,000
And I think this price drop was really the right thing, and it could have happened a

350
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
long time ago, granted.

351
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
And I think PS3 is moving in a pretty good direction.

352
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:08,000
And one reason why I'm saying that is because finally we got another really good PlayStation

353
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,000
3 exclusive game this week, and that's one of the games I've been playing this week,

354
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,000
is Demon's Souls.

355
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Here's the thing, though.

356
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Demon's Souls is not for everybody.

357
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
It's, from what I hear, it is hard.

358
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,000
I've dropped probably four or five hours in this game.

359
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
I've rolled three different characters.

360
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:28,000
I've beaten the tutorial level, and I consistently get my ass handed to me in the first level.

361
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
It is that hard of a game.

362
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:36,000
This game is the Mega Man 9 of role-playing games, although I don't want to think role-playing

363
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:41,000
games as like Final Fantasy role-playing game because it's more of an action-y RPG.

364
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Think a little more like Oblivion in the third person.

365
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:48,000
This game is so hardcore, it's like D&D.

366
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
I mean, you have to consider everything.

367
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:54,000
You have to consider the weights of the weapons you're carrying, all these different statistics.

368
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
There's no pause.

369
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
There is no pause in this game.

370
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,000
There is no pause in this game because the game's online.

371
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
And this is the interesting thing.

372
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:06,000
This is the part that makes Demon's Souls fascinating is the online component because

373
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
it's not an MMO.

374
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
It's not a single-player role-playing game.

375
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Let me give you an idea of the types of stuff you do in this game.

376
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:17,000
You can leave markings on the ground that have little messages for other people,

377
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
but you can't type in your own messages.

378
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Sorry, Loki.

379
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:24,000
You have to choose from like a predetermined set that kind of works like a mad lib.

380
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:28,000
In other words, you can put down a sentence that says, beware of blank ahead.

381
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
And then the next screen would say, what do you want to be in the blank?

382
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Enemies, gold, trap, what do you want it to say?

383
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:38,000
So you put these mad lib-ish type warnings down, and then people can rate these messages up.

384
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,000
And if they get rated up, your character gets healed.

385
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
You might suddenly see a message pop on your screen.

386
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Your message has been rated up, and you get a little bit of life point back,

387
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:51,000
which is good because otherwise you can't really get it back very easily.

388
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:55,000
And then if it sucks, well, your message just never shows up in other people's worlds.

389
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,000
The less it gets rated, the less it just goes away.

390
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
The other component is that you'll have blood stains.

391
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,000
When people die in the world, their blood stain appears,

392
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,000
and you can touch the blood stain and watch how they die.

393
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
That's awesome.

394
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Which is kind of interesting.

395
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:14,000
It helps you learn lessons because there's little surprises around every corner and all this stuff.

396
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
So here's the thing, though.

397
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Here's how unforgiving the game is.

398
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
The currency of the game is souls.

399
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Souls by beating monsters.

400
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:26,000
If you die in a level, you go all the way back to start.

401
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:33,000
You lose all your souls, all of them, and the whole level starts over.

402
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:39,000
If you can get back to where your blood stain was and touch it, you get all your souls back.

403
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
If you die again, you're fucked.

404
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
It's gone.

405
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
You lose everything.

406
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
This game is not messing around.

407
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,000
It is a very, very difficult game.

408
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:52,000
When I say it is the Mega Man 9 of role-playing games, I'm not kidding.

409
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
You know how Mega Man 9 is?

410
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:59,000
You have to go in, you have to die, die, die, and learn a distinct pattern in how to beat the level.

411
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Once you learn the pattern to beat the level, it's never a problem again.

412
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
That's very similar to what this game is.

413
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
As I'm going through the level,

414
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
oh, demon hiding behind the wood,

415
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
oh, demon hiding around the corner,

416
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
oh, two demons over here,

417
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
you start to learn the patterns.

418
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:18,000
It just is difficult still for me because a lot of it has to do with timing.

419
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,000
If you want to beat really hard enemies, you have to be able to block

420
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:25,000
and then basically jab your sword into the enemy.

421
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
It gets really hard.

422
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:32,000
I'm just saying this game is not fucking around with the difficulty.

423
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:37,000
If you think you're going to throw a controller across the room, you probably will.

424
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:41,000
That's where you might need to decide if this game is worth dropping $60 on or not

425
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:47,000
because I think the challenge is this game's biggest asset and it's game's biggest drawback.

426
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:53,000
I usually don't go on and read internet reviews of games before I review it myself

427
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:56,000
because I'm afraid I'm going to steal things from reviews,

428
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
but I had to do it this way.

429
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:00,000
It just indirectly might say something that I read in a review,

430
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
but I have to repeat this.

431
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,000
This was on a review somewhere.

432
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:07,000
It is the anti-casual game, I think is the perfect way to describe this game.

433
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
It is the anti-casual game.

434
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
It's R-Type.

435
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Is it a rewarding experience though?

436
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Heck yeah because it feels really good when you are able to successfully beat a level

437
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
and get past a point you've never got before.

438
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:24,000
That's a reward you haven't really seen since 8-bit gaming days.

439
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
One other thing I do want to say about online mode.

440
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
I haven't gotten to this part myself,

441
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:32,000
but apparently this gets in later on after you beat the first couple levels

442
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:37,000
is that when you die or I guess some of the stains on the floor

443
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:41,000
start being that you can warp yourself into someone else's world

444
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
and help them beat the boss,

445
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:48,000
or you can go into someone else's world as a black phantom and try to kill them.

446
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,000
So now you can be the enemy in someone else's world.

447
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
That's awesome.

448
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
And you get rewarded if you kill the other player.

449
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
But here's the other thing to keep in mind.

450
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
There is no friends list in this game.

451
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
There is no voice chat in the game.

452
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
It is all anonymous.

453
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
So when you're the black phantom, you're a silent killer.

454
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:06,000
They don't even know who killed them.

455
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
That sounds like fun.

456
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:12,000
The tricky thing about being the phantom is that if you're just out there,

457
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,000
I think they purposely make the phantoms a little weaker,

458
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:18,000
but if you know the levels, if you've really worked at the levels,

459
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,000
and you kind of know the good hiding spaces like around corners and stuff,

460
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:25,000
you can just beat the shit out of somebody that you storm in their level.

461
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
That's awesome.

462
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Loki, I think you would sit there all day

463
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,000
and be the black phantom on people's levels and have fun with it.

464
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:35,000
You should see me play Grand Theft Auto, man.

465
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:38,000
What we've been doing now where we have random people coming into our games,

466
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
because we do ranked games now,

467
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:43,000
so basically if you sign on to a ranked game when we're online playing a ranked game

468
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:46,000
or in the lobby, you will be in our ranked game.

469
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,000
And then I will mock you on our end,

470
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:54,000
because no one realizes that all five of us or four of us are in the same room.

471
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
So we'll be like, okay, he's coming around the corner.

472
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,000
Boom!

473
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:00,000
Just knock the guy down and we'll kind of not really gang up on them,

474
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,000
but we'll help each other.

475
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:06,000
Oh, man, I talk shit when other people are in there.

476
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,000
It's awesome.

477
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
Going to some comments from our chat, chat.orangelandsradio.com,

478
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:13,000
Kitsune says, by that means, they can come into your world and kill you.

479
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,000
Yes, they can.

480
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:17,000
I am told the game warns you when a black phantom has entered your level,

481
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:20,000
but it doesn't tell you anything beyond that.

482
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,000
And let's see, Hitstun says, this sounds awesome.

483
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
Too bad it's a PS3 exclusive.

484
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,000
That's actually my point, Hitstun.

485
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,000
That's why I said kind of before I went into this story,

486
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:33,000
Sony's finally gaining some ground moving into this holiday season.

487
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:37,000
Sony PS3 has had some great exclusives.

488
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
For the platformers, they have LittleBigPlanet.

489
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
For the first-person shooters, they have Resistance.

490
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:45,000
Now they have something for the action RPGers, and that's Demon's Souls.

491
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
And to some extent, you could say Valkyria Chronicles 2,

492
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:52,000
although that's more of a, you know, why can't I think of the name all of a sudden?

493
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,000
Real?

494
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,000
The strategy, RTS game.

495
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,000
Thank you.

496
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
Leo Shen wants to know how far did I get.

497
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:00,000
Dude, I can't even beat Voltaria Palace 1-1.

498
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
That's how hard this game is.

499
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:06,000
Like, I keep getting killed by the blue-eyed guy.

500
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,000
But I'm trying.

501
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:10,000
I just, I keep rerolling characters to think it can,

502
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:15,000
I actually hear the easiest way through it is with the royalty character,

503
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
because even though they start at the lowest level, they have the soul arrow,

504
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
so that's what I'm trying to do now.

505
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
But I'm finding it makes you really weak.

506
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:24,000
So I got gang raped by two fire-wielding guys.

507
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:27,000
I can't even get back to where I was with my soldier.

508
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:31,000
Anyhow, Demon's Souls is the name of the game.

509
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:34,000
One other game I do want to mention that I played, another PS3 exclusive,

510
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:37,000
go figure, Katamari Forever on the PlayStation 3.

511
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
I did pick up this week, finally.

512
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,000
It's a little cheaper than Demon's Souls.

513
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
Demon's Souls set me back 60.

514
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,000
I believe Katamari Forever was 49.99 or 50.

515
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,000
Yeah, 40.

516
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:49,000
So it's a little cheaper, but you know what?

517
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:52,000
I had more fun playing this than I did the Xbox 360 version,

518
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,000
beautiful Katamari.

519
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
I don't know why.

520
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,000
I'm not trying to hate on 360.

521
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:00,000
I do miss my 360, and I will be getting it fixed soon

522
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:06,000
when I finally can't resist anymore wanting to play Beatles Rock Band

523
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
and some of the other online games I've been missing out on

524
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,000
while my 360 has been broken.

525
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
But I will say Katamari Forever is really cool.

526
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,000
I love the way it controls.

527
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:17,000
The music is cute, having it back in the levels.

528
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:20,000
I have to admit, I haven't fully explored the game,

529
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
because I've been kind of a little busy playing Demon's Souls

530
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,000
and killing in that game.

531
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:28,000
But I'm already having more fun with this than I was the 360 version of the game,

532
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:32,000
even though this admittedly is a rehash of a lot of the levels.

533
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:35,000
But what I like is that they do put new elements in the levels.

534
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:39,000
You can go back and play the old levels as the old levels if you want.

535
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
And to be honest, I haven't played the game in so long

536
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:44,000
that all the levels are feeling new to me again

537
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
after two, three years of not playing it.

538
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:49,000
But I do think the price point may be a little high

539
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:52,000
considering that a lot of it is recycled.

540
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:55,000
If you've never played Katamari Damacy before, though,

541
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
this is a really good entry-level game.

542
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:01,000
If you have all the other games, you might want to wait for a price drop.

543
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
I just think for a lot of folks, 50 bucks,

544
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
unless you're a hardcore fan of the series,

545
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
you're going to be like, come on, too much.

546
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:10,000
So there you go.

547
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:13,000
All right, so that was pretty much my gaming week.

548
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:16,000
I did play some other stuff, but I've talked too much about the other games.

549
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
I want to get into some gaming news.

550
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,000
I know you guys do, too.

551
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,000
We're going to get into it.

552
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
First off, some housekeeping real quick.

553
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
The podcast feed is behind.

554
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:27,000
I'm sorry about that, but vacations will do that.

555
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:31,000
I did get 338 on the feed tonight, so all that's left is 339 in the mini show.

556
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:34,000
So those will go up this week before this week's show does.

557
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:39,000
So part of the problem was that when I was last here at Dark Soccer's house,

558
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:42,000
I didn't upload 339 to our server.

559
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
I uploaded 329.

560
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:47,000
So I was never going to be able to put up more than what I put up today.

561
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:50,000
So that was my bad, and I'm sorry for being lazy.

562
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:55,000
But vacations happen, so I guess more incentive to tune in live when you can,

563
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
but I will try to be better for the podcast feed listeners.

564
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:00,000
I know you guys have been kind of pooped on a lot in 2009,

565
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
so I apologize for that.

566
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
Anyhow, that's really it.

567
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
Otherwise, go ahead and add us on Twitter.

568
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,000
We are soon going to have a new Facebook fan page.

569
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,000
I know we have our Facebook forums,

570
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
but we're actually going to work on building a fan page

571
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:16,000
so that way we can notify you about new shows in your friend feed

572
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,000
if you want.

573
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:20,000
If you don't want it, add us anyway, and then block our updates, whatever.

574
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:23,000
But we're going to actually work on an official Orange Laundry Radio page

575
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
that will hopefully be open this week.

576
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
And then, of course, we still have our live journal,

577
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
our website, orangelaundryradio.com, and so forth.

578
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
Let's get into some actual gaming news now.

579
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:34,000
Thirty minutes into the show, we can finally talk gaming news.

580
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:37,000
There's been quite a bit in the time we've been gone.

581
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
Loki, start us off tonight, if you would.

582
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
Yes, and it's interesting.

583
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:46,000
The game that was kind of teased around, and actually it was pretty sweet

584
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
from the concept art that was leaked,

585
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:53,000
Epic Mickey has been confirmed via the newest Game Informer.

586
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
It's on the cover.

587
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:58,000
And, of course, they have the inside story about that as well.

588
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:01,000
The game is being done by War Inspector,

589
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:04,000
and it's actually pretty sweet looking.

590
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:08,000
It takes place kind of in this dark Disney-type world

591
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:14,000
where Mickey will actually be facing up against some forgotten Disney characters

592
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:17,000
who are all really twisted looking.

593
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:20,000
I mean, this stuff is like some Alice McGee type of stuff,

594
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:24,000
but apparently the villain in the game is supposed to be Oswald the Rabbit,

595
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:29,000
who I had no idea who he was, so therefore perfect for this,

596
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:34,000
since it's a character that's been forgotten.

597
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:37,000
Very cool looking game, and right now it's been confirmed

598
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:43,000
to be exclusive for the Wii, but it might actually be coming out later on,

599
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,000
maybe on some other platforms.

600
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:47,000
I hope it actually comes out on 360 or PS3,

601
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:50,000
because the visuals that they have right now in the concept art look awesome,

602
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:53,000
and I just don't know if it's going to translate well over to the Wii,

603
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:56,000
but definitely want to play this game.

604
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
It's a pretty epic looking RPG.

605
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:02,000
Have we seen much outside of the one screenshot that's on the magazine cover?

606
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:06,000
They've had artwork put out from it, and it looks really dark.

607
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:09,000
I'm almost surprised it's even on the Wii.

608
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:13,000
Well, the Wii's kind of needed something like Epic Mickey,

609
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
so I get it, and I'm going to give it a chance.

610
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
I think a lot of people are like,

611
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:22,000
boo, this isn't coming to 360 or PS3, it can't be that epic,

612
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
but I'm saying, wait a minute, give this a chance,

613
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:28,000
because what this game's trying to do is fill a niche that the Wii doesn't have,

614
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
because the Wii right now is known as a shovelware system

615
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:34,000
with the occasional awesome Metroid or Mario game.

616
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
That's what the Wii is right now.

617
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:39,000
So, okay, let's give Epic Mickey a chance to fill a void that's needed.

618
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:42,000
So I'm hopeful, even though, yeah, I can't be high def,

619
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:45,000
graphics aren't everything, let's remember that.

620
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:48,000
And right now, the reason why it's on the Wii exclusively

621
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:53,000
is because the control system that's in the game relies on motion controls,

622
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:58,000
and since I don't know when it's going to be coming out,

623
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
if it's spring next year, it might be too early,

624
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:03,000
maybe they don't have time to work with development kits for Natal,

625
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:07,000
or whatever they're calling the PlayStation 3 motion controller.

626
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
We'll see more of these games later on.

627
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
And who's to say that they couldn't, if this is really popular,

628
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:16,000
do a sequel, it'll be on all platforms, or even port this later on.

629
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
So I wouldn't rule it out, but...

630
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
Well, here's my thing, though.

631
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
What's wrong with Kingdom Hearts?

632
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:25,000
I mean, isn't Kingdom Hearts, in a way, epic Mickey?

633
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
I mean, I realize that games are going to be different.

634
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:30,000
I realize this is not going to be a role-playing game or what have you.

635
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:33,000
I kind of look at this and go, is this going to kill off Kingdom Hearts?

636
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
Because that's kind of too bad.

637
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:38,000
Because Kingdom Hearts, I always thought, was kind of an epic Mickey.

638
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,000
I mean, yeah, I was...

639
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
I don't think it co-exists.

640
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,000
I hope so.

641
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:46,000
But, I mean, there was always those rumors that Kingdom Hearts 3,

642
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:50,000
whenever it actually happens, was going to do away with the Disney.

643
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
I mean, is that what we're looking at?

644
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
Now the Disney is over here?

645
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:58,000
I mean, I guess we don't know until we really get some final words on Kingdom Hearts 3.

646
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:02,000
But how much Disney is involved with these handheld Kingdom Hearts games?

647
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:05,000
I've got to admit, I haven't been following the handheld Kingdom Hearts games.

648
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,000
Maybe the chat can help.

649
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,000
I don't really know.

650
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:11,000
Chatters, how much Disney are in those handheld Kingdom Hearts games?

651
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:14,000
I mean, are they already phasing the Disney out?

652
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
I'm not really sure.

653
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:20,000
I never played the DS version that just came out, so I don't know.

654
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:23,000
All right, well, granted the games can co-exist,

655
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:27,000
and we can't really rate this game until it's actually out.

656
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:31,000
But I do kind of pose that question, is that, well, isn't Kingdom Hearts, in some extent,

657
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,000
kind of an epic Mickey game?

658
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:37,000
And, granted, you can still have Kingdom Hearts co-exist with

659
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:41,000
Happy Birthday Disney Princess or whatever that game is on the Wii.

660
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:44,000
It's not like Kingdom Hearts is the sole only Disney game.

661
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:47,000
And X-Link confirms, yes, there is a lot in the games.

662
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:51,000
So whatever I heard about Disney being phased out is just a sick rumor.

663
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:56,000
Although, I will tell you, being at Disneyland twice in the past month,

664
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
there isn't a lot of Kingdom Hearts.

665
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:01,000
In fact, there is no Kingdom Hearts references in either park.

666
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:05,000
Which, I understand, because Square Enix, that's really their thing.

667
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:10,000
But you would think it still raises Disney awareness as kind of a bummer.

668
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:14,000
They don't have at least a Sora something to buy.

669
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:17,000
Well, it looks like, though, this game is going to be more like Disney Park stuff

670
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:21,000
because they show, kind of in the concept art here,

671
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:25,000
they have the castle in the background, they've got the Haunted Mansion in there.

672
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:29,000
They also have, you know, it's a small world in there.

673
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
They've got, you know, the characters.

674
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:36,000
They have, it looks like, it's just, it's going to be awesome.

675
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:39,000
I'm worried that it's going to be too dark and the people are going to be like,

676
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:43,000
oh my god, this is, you know, my kids are going to get nightmares from this, you know.

677
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:47,000
Because some of the creatures that they've shown so far are pretty creepy

678
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:50,000
and for a little kid, it would not be appropriate for them.

679
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:53,000
But is it going to be dark in like a, I mean, let's face it,

680
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
there's a lot of dark things at Disneyland now.

681
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:58,000
It's Halloween time there. They have Haunted Mansion.

682
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,000
I guess it would...

683
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:02,000
The ghost galaxy, if I were a little kid, would be freaked out by it.

684
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
As an adult, I think it's funny.

685
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:09,000
I think it's dark as in like, you know, the toys, I guess, like, you know, in Toy Story,

686
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:12,000
how they had the toys that the neighbor kid, you know, put together

687
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:15,000
and they're all creepy looking like the baby doll head.

688
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,000
That was a spider thing.

689
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:20,000
Imagine that but with Disney head, you know, characters of Disney

690
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:24,000
with their heads all over the place and machine parts and claws and stuff all over the place.

691
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
I can't believe Disney would allow that.

692
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
That just seems weird to me.

693
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:32,000
Like, non-distinct heads and things I would get or a nightmare before Christmas.

694
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:36,000
Like, I'll see if I can pull up some pictures for you and check it out.

695
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:40,000
Reading some comments from chat, because there's a lot of talk in chat about Epic Mickey,

696
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:45,000
Black Wolf says, I do know that Square and Disney don't like each other, at least in the US.

697
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:49,000
Kitsune says, even at Tokyo Disney, nothing from Kingdom Hearts.

698
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:52,000
I guess Kitsune has been there recently.

699
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:56,000
Tigerclaw says, oh my, I would imagine during the It's a Small World level,

700
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:00,000
the gamers will be tortured with that music playing on repeat.

701
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:04,000
So, like, here's some concept art that they had for Epic Mickey.

702
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
It's kind of very steampunk-ish.

703
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:10,000
Like, they have this, like, you know, ship thing with Epcot on there.

704
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:17,000
They've got, you know, just, like, some characters running around and, like, machines and stuff.

705
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:22,000
Like, there's Goofy right there that looks like a zombie almost.

706
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:25,000
Some, like, twisted, I don't even know what that is, you know.

707
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:30,000
This is, you know what this is? This is, like, the Return to Oz of Disney.

708
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
Did anyone ever see Return to Oz when they were kids?

709
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,000
It was awesome.

710
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,000
And read the books, too.

711
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,000
In the 80s? Dude.

712
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:38,000
Okay, for those that never saw Return to Oz back in the 80s,

713
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:42,000
because I was, like, seven when this movie came out, which means half our listeners weren't even born.

714
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:46,000
But here's the thing is that, okay, when Return to Oz came out,

715
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
first off, Feruza Balk was Dorothy.

716
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:51,000
And if you don't know who she is, she was, like, the twisted chick in the craft.

717
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
I don't know what else she's been in lately.

718
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
But she was in American History X, I think, and something else.

719
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,000
Okay, she was Dorothy.

720
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:00,000
And, like, the movie started out with her in an insane asylum, right?

721
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:07,000
And she goes, and she goes to this area where the witch, whoever she was, the bad witch,

722
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:10,000
and you all forgive me, my details of the story are scattered.

723
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,000
Maybe Jamie can help.

724
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,000
She was another princess.

725
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,000
Oh, was she another princess?

726
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,000
She collected heads in jars.

727
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
Of pretty women.

728
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
Yeah, she was after Dorothy's head to get.

729
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:21,000
So she was, like, and you would actually see, like, the heads in jars and things.

730
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:27,000
And, like, you saw all your favorite, like, characters from The Wizard of Oz, like,

731
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:32,000
Turn to Stone and, like, Frozen and Time, and it was a very dark-looking world.

732
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:36,000
I mean, for the, and this was, I believe, a movie Disney put out, wasn't it?

733
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,000
Maybe.

734
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:42,000
Yeah, well, even that, though, the characters that pick up along the way, like TikTok,

735
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:47,000
he was a different clockwork man, and he looked a bit more.

736
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:52,000
But when they brought in the Scarecrow and Tin Man and all of them, they looked very...

737
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
They looked like the old book.

738
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,000
Burtonized.

739
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,000
Yeah.

740
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:02,000
If I remember right, this movie took so long to come out because MGM had to lose the rights

741
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:06,000
to make the future Oz movies, and I think Disney put this one out.

742
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:09,000
So it was really weird that it was kind of a darker movie.

743
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:13,000
So, you know, Disney is capable of doing darker things.

744
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:16,000
It is just surprising that it would be their character.

745
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
That's why I'm calling this the return to Oz of new years.

746
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:21,000
If you don't know what I'm talking about, this movie's like a cult classic now.

747
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,000
It's out on DVD.

748
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,000
It's awesome.

749
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,000
Check it out.

750
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,000
It is a pretty awesome movie.

751
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:28,000
Like, it just, it'll warp your fragile little seven-year-old mind if you have kids.

752
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:32,000
It's, if you can't stand The Wizard of Oz, this movie is awesome.

753
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,000
I mean, because it's actually...

754
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:36,000
I think they should go back and do all the Oz movies this kind of style because it'd

755
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,000
be really sweet.

756
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:43,000
But anyways, so yeah, really creepy shit, you know, that's in all these concept things.

757
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
And so I hope they stick to it.

758
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:49,000
I mean, I hope they stick to their guns and try something risky because you know what?

759
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:54,000
You can put out a game for Disney's Princess and the Frog, you know,

760
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:57,000
and it may sell X number of copies or whatever, and that's fine.

761
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,000
But you know what?

762
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
Do something ballsy, and you know what?

763
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:03,000
It will, they'll get a good return on it.

764
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
Because gamers will buy it.

765
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:09,000
I'm curious, you know, and then I'm looking at the big picture is that what could this,

766
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:13,000
you know, if this does really, really well, what could this mean for, like,

767
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
what would happen at Disneyland and some of these places?

768
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:18,000
Like, could we get, like, an attraction based off of, like, creepy Disney?

769
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
I don't know.

770
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
Maybe a California adventure.

771
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,000
Maybe.

772
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,000
All right.

773
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:28,000
Anyhow, Kitsune, by the way, had never heard of Return to Oz, I guess,

774
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
and is very excited about the movie.

775
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:34,000
Put the trailer in chat and says, somehow this feels like Labyrinth.

776
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
Well, it came out around that same time.

777
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,000
It does feel kind of like Labyrinth.

778
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,000
It was a lot like Labyrinth.

779
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:41,000
I mean, this was that time in the 80s when you had, like, Never Ending Story,

780
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:44,000
Labyrinth, Dark Crystal, you know, Return to Oz.

781
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
They all came out right around the same time.

782
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:50,000
You know, they were all in that mid-early 80s phase, so.

783
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:53,000
The golden age of, you know, adventure movies.

784
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
Of fucking up children's minds.

785
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:58,000
Seriously, those are some fucked up movies we had as a kid.

786
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:01,000
Say my name!

787
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:05,000
And then you never really understood what the hell her name was.

788
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,000
I never got that.

789
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:09,000
They said what it was.

790
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,000
I used to know.

791
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
Crap, I'll have to look it up again.

792
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
I think we even tried turning on the subtitles once

793
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
to find out what her goddamn name was,

794
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:20,000
and it said Untangible or something.

795
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:24,000
Or Scream's name or something like that, where I was like, dammit!

796
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
All right, anyhow.

797
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:29,000
Moving on to some more gaming news, because Epic Mickey does sound pretty epic.

798
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000
But moving on back to the 360, and I got to say,

799
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
the early screenshots for this look kind of cool.

800
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:36,000
It's something called the Retrocade.

801
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
Now, this isn't something that's confirmed.

802
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:42,000
I want to point out, this is news and rumors coming to us from a survey

803
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
that is currently out there with consumers.

804
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
And of course, when a survey goes out there,

805
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:49,000
somebody's going to take screen prints of it and send it to your favorite gaming blogs.

806
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:52,000
This is a project that's known as a lot of different names,

807
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,000
according to the survey.

808
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:58,000
Game Room, Retrocade, Tower of Rom, Classics Live.

809
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:02,000
Tower of Rom is kind of awesome, although I don't see that being the actual name.

810
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:07,000
I think Retrocade or Classics Live sound a lot more realistic.

811
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:15,000
Anyhow, they are saying that this is something that I guess looks a lot like PlayStation Home,

812
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,000
but they're not calling it PlayStation Home.

813
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:20,000
It's just something where the 360 avatars are in there,

814
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:27,000
and they're kind of walking around, and they're playing arcade games.

815
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,000
That's all we really know based on the survey.

816
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
We don't know to the full extent what the interactivity is here.

817
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,000
But you look at one of these screenshots,

818
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:36,000
and you can see two levels of video games with the avatars around.

819
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
And when I look at the titles of the games,

820
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
they look like they might actually be old-school games.

821
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:44,000
That little graphic there, that's an Intellivision graphic.

822
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:47,000
That little guy there is from the Intellivision series.

823
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:51,000
And it looks like the name of the game there is baseball from Intellivision.

824
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,000
Yeah, it has the Atari logos.

825
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,000
So I don't know what the deal is going on here.

826
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,000
Maybe this is like old-school 80s games,

827
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,000
Atari and Intellivision coming out, or what it is.

828
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:02,000
But it could be interesting.

829
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:06,000
I don't know, what would you guys like to see in regards to retro-ness on the 360?

830
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
I think it would be cool to have something like that.

831
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
Or that would be even kind of cool instead of like home.

832
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:15,000
You can just go walk around and play arcade games.

833
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:20,000
Instead of watching Twilight trailers.

834
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,000
Right.

835
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,000
But yeah, I've got to say though,

836
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:27,000
doing this in home, going into a virtual space to launch a game,

837
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,000
isn't that exciting?

838
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:31,000
Like it's one of those things that seems a lot cooler when you hear about it.

839
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,000
It's kind of irritating, isn't it?

840
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:36,000
Yeah, so I've got to wonder, what is going to make this cool?

841
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:40,000
Why am I going to want to go into this little front end with all the little avatars?

842
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:43,000
Beer would make it cool.

843
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,000
Achievement points.

844
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,000
Oh Lord.

845
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,000
You have found a game! Achievement point!

846
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:52,000
You have sneezed, achievement point.

847
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
Sadly, you're probably right.

848
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
No! Hey, I got an idea.

849
00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:00,000
Well, it wouldn't really work with the classic games so much,

850
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:03,000
but like you could have, you know, say,

851
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:06,000
redemption games and you earn tickets or whatever

852
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:10,000
and you can redeem stuff for your avatar like costumes and crap.

853
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:13,000
What if, you might be onto something here,

854
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:18,000
what if Xbox Live charged you like ten cents to play

855
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:22,000
for one play of these games that might redeem?

856
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
You know, because there was other news this week,

857
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
and I know Bobby talked about it on his show,

858
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,000
it didn't make the cut for our show,

859
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:30,000
but they talked about the sports jerseys.

860
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
I know he talked about it on his show.

861
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
The sports jerseys made their way to Xbox Live this week.

862
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
What, four bucks a pop for the jerseys?

863
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
And I know he was surveying his listeners tonight about,

864
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:42,000
you know, would they pay for that or not?

865
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:46,000
Do you think there would be any interest in putting in like ten cents,

866
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:50,000
twenty-five cents to play a game and possibly unlock something from the game?

867
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,000
Do you think people would do that?

868
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,000
I think people would bite at that, you know,

869
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,000
like eight points or something like that.

870
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,000
Because they've talked about this as a distribution method

871
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,000
for games before for the online games,

872
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:02,000
both PSN and Xbox Live, is they put in a quarter to play the game

873
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:05,000
and then that way you're not paying like five bucks to own it

874
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,000
if you're only going to play it once or twice.

875
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:10,000
Is your mic on?

876
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,000
No, it is now.

877
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:12,000
There it is.

878
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:13,000
There's consumer wars out there.

879
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,000
I would try it just to try it.

880
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:19,000
I think that a quarter would be, well,

881
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:24,000
I think that it should be along the lines of, oh, play this,

882
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:29,000
and if you decide that you want it permanently then, you know,

883
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:30,000
like pay for demo.

884
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:34,000
Well, either way, you know it's going to be their virtual money anyway.

885
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,000
Yeah.

886
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:38,000
So, all right.

887
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:41,000
Well, anyhow, it's going to be interesting to see what comes of that.

888
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:42,000
Of course, it could be nothing.

889
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:43,000
It could just be a survey.

890
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:44,000
We'll see.

891
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:47,000
DarkSakura.

892
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:52,000
Well, for other, I guess we can sort of call this nostalgic

893
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:55,000
even though it's an ongoing series,

894
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:59,000
but there's the pop music portable

895
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:02,000
that's supposed to be coming out on PSP

896
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
with the nine button mode and everything,

897
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:08,000
but it looks like there's going to be a story mode in it.

898
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:13,000
And so, because you can go around like sort of a board game map thingy

899
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:19,000
like Mario Party-ish, and you go that way to unlock new songs and things,

900
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:23,000
but this sort of makes me think of, like, you know the pop music,

901
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:28,000
I have pop music seven where you play through

902
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:32,000
as the little superhero guy at the end of the thing like a board game

903
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:33,000
and you unlock stuff.

904
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,000
It's more like an old RPG,

905
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:40,000
but maybe that's just the post game unlock mode thing.

906
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,000
I don't know if it's an actual story mode.

907
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:45,000
Now, for those who don't know what pop music is,

908
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:48,000
because not everybody who listens to our show now is a music game fan,

909
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:51,000
it's basically think like, I guess you could say,

910
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,000
a guitar hero or a rock band,

911
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:57,000
but with a controller that looks like nine pop-o-matic bubbles

912
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:58,000
from the game Trouble,

913
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:01,000
and they're kind of laid out in a five on the bottom,

914
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,000
four on the top pattern,

915
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:07,000
and you use these to play songs like a la Guitar Hero, basically.

916
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:10,000
How in the hell is this going to translate to PSP?

917
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:13,000
Maybe they'll have an add-on or something?

918
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,000
Japan's kind of used to this, though.

919
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,000
Japan kind of will play these games.

920
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,000
You've seen DDR on the Game Boy.

921
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,000
They have DJ Max on there.

922
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:24,000
Yeah, DJ Max is really popular on PSP and other countries.

923
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:27,000
Even here, to some extent, has a cult following here.

924
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:31,000
I guess these type of button beat games are okay.

925
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,000
Would this game ever come out in the US, though?

926
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:34,000
I don't know.

927
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:37,000
How desperate is Konami for money? That's really the question.

928
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:40,000
You would think, though, now that it's all going digital distribution,

929
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:44,000
how hard would it be for them to just slap it up on the download and let it be?

930
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,000
Minimal localization for that.

931
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:49,000
Right, but do you think they'll still do it? Probably not.

932
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:50,000
No, they're leaving.

933
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:51,000
Sad.

934
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:52,000
Unfortunately.

935
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:53,000
Anyway.

936
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:57,000
All right, well, I guess we'll see if a controller comes out for this game or not,

937
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:58,000
but probably not.

938
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:01,000
But the story modes, hey, this game already sounds better than pop-o-music.

939
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:03,000
We are getting that here in America.

940
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:10,000
And it's already better than whatever beaten groovy told you we started.

941
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:13,000
Anyways, DJ Hero will be coming out in a couple weeks,

942
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:18,000
and the full song list has been released by Activision

943
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:24,000
and features 93 tracks with 100 different songs composing those tracks.

944
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,000
And some of the neat little things I thought I'd mention,

945
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:32,000
some of the tracks that we have here that I thought were interesting.

946
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:33,000
Let's see.

947
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,000
Of course, you may remember the remix that I did,

948
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:38,000
Shout vs. Eric Pride's Piano.

949
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:42,000
Well, there's also going to be two other Shout remixes as well.

950
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:47,000
Tears for Fears Shout vs. DJ Shadow's 6 Days remix featuring Mos Def

951
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:50,000
and Shout vs. Eric B and Rakim.

952
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,000
Eric B is the president.

953
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:58,000
That one is mixed by DJ Jazzy Jeff, all completely different sounding.

954
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,000
They have another one also versus piano,

955
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:03,000
Somebody Told Me by The Killers vs. Piano, which will be interesting.

956
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:07,000
Vanilla Ice Ice Ice Baby vs. MC Hammer You Can't Touch This.

957
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:13,000
And then also a little bit more 80's or I guess early 90's music in there.

958
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:19,000
Ice Ice Baby vs. Paula Abdul's Straight Up, which that would be kind of interesting.

959
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:24,000
If that's not your kind of thing, there may be some Herbie Hancock Rocket.

960
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:28,000
They've got a beat juggle version of that and also Rocket vs. Nerd's Lap Dance.

961
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:32,000
That one's produced by Grandmaster Flash.

962
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:40,000
And then Foreigner, Jukebox Hero vs. DJ Z-Trip featuring Mers, DJ Hero.

963
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:46,000
That's produced and mixed by DJ Z-Trip.

964
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:49,000
And then some of the songs that we'll be hearing tonight later on.

965
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:55,000
Foreigner, Jukebox Hero, only live for our live listeners during break.

966
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:59,000
Foo Fighters Monkey Wrench vs. BC Boys Sabotage, the DJ guitar mix.

967
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:04,000
And then also, what do we got here?

968
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:14,000
Boom Boom Pow by Black Eyed Peas and Satisfaction by Benny Banasi.

969
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:17,000
And lots more stuff.

970
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:20,000
But yeah, you can check out the full track list. It's online everywhere.

971
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:24,000
Lots of good songs. I'm very excited to play all these.

972
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:28,000
Now we're actually going to give DJ Hero a little spin here in studio quick.

973
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:31,000
I don't think we're going to play all the songs because of copyright.

974
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:33,000
We'll just play like maybe a minute or so.

975
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,000
But just if you kind of want to hear what this game sounds like.

976
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:38,000
And it's going to be tricky because I kind of want Loki to describe what...

977
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,000
Or I guess maybe I'll describe kind of what he's doing.

978
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:45,000
This is going to be weird radio, but can we plug in DJ Hero and get some of the noise out on the feed here?

979
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:48,000
And I'm going to kind of describe what Loki's doing as he's playing this game.

980
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:52,000
Where are the audio ties? Oh, they're down there. Are those them?

981
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:55,000
Or is that where they're... Okay.

982
00:48:55,000 --> 00:49:01,000
Hold on guys. Live radio. We're actually plugging in the audio for DJ Hero right now.

983
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:06,000
Can you shut it down a little bit?

984
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:17,000
Okay. Did that take down my mics too?

985
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:22,000
Okay. Sorry guys. We're adjusting the audio live here.

986
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:25,000
So, alright.

987
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:29,000
So here we go. So Loki's going to hit start.

988
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:34,000
I don't hear anything either.

989
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:40,000
Oh, there it is. Very quiet. There we go.

990
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:44,000
Sorry guys. I know this isn't the most interesting radio in the world, but right now there's a menu here.

991
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:48,000
Learn to DJ. Quick play single DJ. That's what Loki picked.

992
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:51,000
And in this demo we have Marvin Gaye versus Gorillaz.

993
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:56,000
Gwen Stefani versus Rick James and Black Eyed Peas versus Benny Banasi.

994
00:49:56,000 --> 00:50:01,000
And you can actually see it shows you on the screen who is presenting the track.

995
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:06,000
It shows what's called the intensity, which this is low.

996
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:11,000
And the duration, 3 minutes and 48 seconds for the song that Loki currently has selected.

997
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:14,000
And then you can actually see performance on different levels.

998
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:19,000
I don't know if that shows how well Loki's done or what that is showing there.

999
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:24,000
Do we have the audio?

1000
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:30,000
Is the connection bad?

1001
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:34,000
There you go.

1002
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:44,000
I think those wires are weird.

1003
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:49,000
Uh oh, is there a mixing board? That's not good.

1004
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:54,000
Sorry guys.

1005
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:59,000
The reason why you're hearing it bounce from left to right, those of you listening live, are podcasts are mono.

1006
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:06,000
Loki's doing one at a time here.

1007
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:09,000
We're having the board just to match it. There you go.

1008
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:16,000
Don't touch it. Just play.

1009
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,000
Did the audio already go out?

1010
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,000
Oh crap.

1011
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:23,000
All right. Well, maybe we won't get to play it live tonight.

1012
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:26,000
We will later. You're going to fix it for later.

1013
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:30,000
All right. So we just won't get to play it during the show for the podcasters. That was a waste of time.

1014
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,000
Sorry guys.

1015
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,000
Are you working on that now?

1016
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:38,000
All right. All right. Fair enough.

1017
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:41,000
I don't know what to talk about here in the meantime.

1018
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:44,000
Should I just go on to the next story? We'll come back.

1019
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:48,000
Yeah, we'll do that. I'm going to go on to the next story. We'll come back.

1020
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:51,000
The next story has to do with the Wii Balance Board.

1021
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:56,000
The Wii Balance Board apparently is now being used in some airport screening.

1022
00:51:56,000 --> 00:52:00,000
Now, this is only a study. It's not actually something you're going to go to the airport and see right now.

1023
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:09,000
But apparently, the US government has invested some money into actually looking at using the Wii Balance Board in airport screening.

1024
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:12,000
So this is according to a CNN report.

1025
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:18,000
This is a couple of experimental methods that are being used right now to see who is suspicious at the airport.

1026
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:24,000
This is being done by scientists that are part of the Future Attribute Screening Technology, or FAST program.

1027
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:29,000
They're actually using the Wii Fit peripheral to see how somebody shifts their weight.

1028
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:35,000
They're trying to find, quote, a level of fidgeting that would suggest the need for a secondary screening.

1029
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:40,000
So they're using the Wii Balance Board, I guess it's something that you would kind of step on before you go through the gate,

1030
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:45,000
to see if you are really fidgety while you're going into the airport.

1031
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:50,000
That's kind of weird to me because what if you're just old and you just shake a lot?

1032
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:53,000
I mean, wouldn't that set off some red flags?

1033
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:58,000
I don't know about you guys, but I don't think this is something you're actually going to see at an airport for quite some time.

1034
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:02,000
You certainly wouldn't see a Wii Balance Board, that's for sure.

1035
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:08,000
Would you see that type of technology embedded into a mat that you step on before you go through the terminal?

1036
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:12,000
Sure. But are you going to see the Wii Balance Board itself out there?

1037
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:16,000
Heck no. That's just going to look dumb. Besides, those things are kind of thin.

1038
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:21,000
And don't forget the Wii Balance Board only supports up to like 300 or 350 pounds.

1039
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:24,000
That doesn't include everybody that you need to screen at an airport.

1040
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:32,000
So if anything else, they may have to take the same technology and use it in some other new device.

1041
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:36,000
Although I don't know why seeing the balance of somebody is going to show if they're a terrorist or not.

1042
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,000
That seems a little silly to me.

1043
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:45,000
I have this bad feeling that this whole thing was just a footnote on some other study that people are taking way too seriously.

1044
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:49,000
Yeah, an X-Link in chat says, old person with MS, Suez Airport.

1045
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:52,000
Yeah, I can see that. I can see that happening.

1046
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:58,000
How we doing, Loki? We okay? Loki's got some new plugs he's going to try.

1047
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:01,000
Like I said, I want to try this the first time.

1048
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:04,000
This is the way he wanted to do it the first time, I guess.

1049
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:06,000
Of course, I'm not hearing anything.

1050
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:10,000
Oh.

1051
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:17,000
It's those plugs there are bad.

1052
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:25,000
Do you have another red and white set you can use besides those plugs?

1053
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:28,000
Only on live radio could this happen, boys and girls.

1054
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:32,000
What about the gray cords? There's gray cords in the box that we used to use.

1055
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:38,000
Those will extend.

1056
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:44,000
Okay, we're trying to right now extend.

1057
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:49,000
Will that even work? Okay, he says yes.

1058
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:52,000
And hopefully these plugs will be a little better.

1059
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:55,000
And that's what Loki is putting in right now.

1060
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:59,000
As we try to demo DJ Hero for you guys here on Orange Lodge Radio.

1061
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:02,000
Much better.

1062
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:06,000
Alright.

1063
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:09,000
Okay.

1064
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:12,000
So which track are you going to play here?

1065
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:18,000
Oh yeah, I'm going to get one. Here we go.

1066
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:21,000
So he can pick his character here if he wants, but he didn't.

1067
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:26,000
So now he's cool Papa G is the character he is.

1068
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:29,000
There's also one named Kitty Smash.

1069
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:31,000
It's like a punk chick.

1070
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:32,000
So alright.

1071
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,000
So he's going to go cool Papa G.

1072
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,000
And now he's picking his difficulty.

1073
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,000
He's going with medium.

1074
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:41,000
Sorry.

1075
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:44,000
Alright, so the song is currently loading.

1076
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,000
And there's a tip on the screen.

1077
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,000
Rewinds are a great way to earn a big score.

1078
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:51,000
Try them in a section you know well.

1079
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:53,000
And it's showing him a little bit about how to play the game.

1080
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:56,000
There's a euphoria button, an effects dial.

1081
00:55:56,000 --> 00:56:01,000
Alright, so this is Marvin Gaye versus Gorillaz.

1082
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:03,000
He's laying down the track.

1083
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:06,000
Here we go.

1084
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:18,000
And right now he's hitting buttons on the controller in time with the beats as they fall.

1085
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:25,000
He's also moving the crossfader back and forth as you see it on the green and the blue sides.

1086
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:29,000
I don't know if he's holding the button down when he does that.

1087
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:33,000
And when he sees these little arrows on the track, he actually has to keep scratching.

1088
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:47,000
Let's just check some there.

1089
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:49,000
I want this remix really bad.

1090
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:54,000
And Logan's actually having to hold down the green or the blue button when he scratches.

1091
00:56:54,000 --> 00:57:20,000
Because they're scratching on both the green and the blue track.

1092
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:32,000
What was that in the middle? He just blared a horn.

1093
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:33,000
Very interesting.

1094
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:35,000
Alright, I don't know if we can play much more here.

1095
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:37,000
I'm going to cut you off, Logan.

1096
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:39,000
Can you just pause it?

1097
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:42,000
Or fail it or whatever?

1098
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:43,000
Alright, there he is. He's going to pause it there.

1099
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:46,000
You will get to hear the whole thing of that on break later.

1100
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:50,000
But unfortunately for the podcast, we have to cut it off because we don't want to get sued by the makers of DJ Hero.

1101
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:54,000
So we used a little bit there for critical review purposes only.

1102
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:55,000
As we're allowed to do.

1103
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:58,000
So, there you go.

1104
00:57:58,000 --> 00:57:59,000
Interesting.

1105
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:01,000
Yeah, it is a bummer we don't have TV.

1106
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:05,000
I don't know what exciting radio that made, but at least I was able to get a feel for the game.

1107
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:07,000
Now I kind of want to play.

1108
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:08,000
Yeah, it looks like fun.

1109
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:09,000
I'll have to play later.

1110
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:10,000
Alright.

1111
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:14,000
Anyhow, we'll get into more DJ Hero here in a little bit, but we have some more news.

1112
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:16,000
Dark Soccer is going to take us to our next story.

1113
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:19,000
I am. Well, I guess I am.

1114
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:25,000
For fans of Beatles Rock Band, there is an actual download content plan in store.

1115
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:31,000
But it's based on how well the next three sets of download content go.

1116
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:42,000
Because the process for doing everything for Beatles Rock Band is expensive and intensive.

1117
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:47,000
Because it's not just like, you know, mastering one song in.

1118
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:57,000
You have to send off the original tape and redo it and bring it back in and have level animation and whatnot ready for it.

1119
00:58:57,000 --> 00:59:01,000
Because it has to fit in with their whole, I guess, branding or whatever.

1120
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:03,000
The feel of the game.

1121
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:06,000
It has to fit the identity of the game.

1122
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:11,000
So, they want to see how everything sells first.

1123
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:17,000
Right now, of course, the only downloadable content is All You Need Is Love.

1124
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:26,000
But on October 20th, we're getting Abbey Road, which will be 1360 Microsoft Points.

1125
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:28,000
Or 160 points per track.

1126
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:33,000
And then we get Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band and Rubber Soul, which Rubber Soul is my favorite.

1127
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:34,000
Just saying.

1128
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,000
Great album.

1129
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:39,000
I had it on vinyl.

1130
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:45,000
And, of course, those are coming out in November and December, respectively.

1131
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:47,000
So, I think it makes sense.

1132
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:53,000
Because it is really a lot of work that goes into it.

1133
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:59,000
Not just for having to master the tracks, but like I said, you've got to make sure that the animation is lined up.

1134
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:03,000
That everything is going to fit the feel of the rest of the game.

1135
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:08,000
Which is why you can't go in and play Aerosmith on Beatles Rock Band or something like that.

1136
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,000
Even though that would be kind of fun.

1137
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:12,000
That would be in Guitar Hero.

1138
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,000
You know what I mean, as an example.

1139
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:19,000
Well, you can't expect that there's going to be new content every week for the Beatles Rock Band.

1140
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:22,000
Obviously, there's a very limited catalog to what they can pick from.

1141
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:24,000
And, of course, you're talking about old music.

1142
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:33,000
You're talking about very protected, very delicate, world icon music that has got to be scrutinized very carefully.

1143
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:37,000
It makes sense why this is not going to be a floodgate worth of material.

1144
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:45,000
If the game enough isn't enough for you, I don't think the download content is going to give you anything that's going to make you go, OMG must buy this game.

1145
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:48,000
If the game enough wasn't good enough, forget it.

1146
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:51,000
But it would be nice to see them pour some more stuff out here.

1147
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:59,000
My thought on this is that there are actually a number of songs in the home game that are just a few that I'm really not familiar with.

1148
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:07,000
And certain songs in different eras are ones that are not on my list of old favorites.

1149
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:11,000
I like a lot of the mid to older stuff better.

1150
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:16,000
But isn't it like maybe exposing you to stuff you haven't heard from a band that is so iconic?

1151
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:17,000
I'll put it this way.

1152
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:22,000
I've at least heard most of the songs in the game once at least.

1153
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:28,000
But I don't really look at it as being a new kind of exposure.

1154
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:32,000
It's just that I would rather have some of my favorites.

1155
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:41,000
Although I wonder how they're doing some of the ones that didn't have a drum track or didn't have any guitar.

1156
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:46,000
For example, Eleanor Rigby only had strings.

1157
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:51,000
So maybe you put your guitar up to your neck and play as a violin.

1158
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:52,000
I'm joking.

1159
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:59,000
You could probably play a sort of like a Let's Talk More Rock instead of Keytar.

1160
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:02,000
You have, you know.

1161
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:04,000
Violin Rock.

1162
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:05,000
Vanessa May.

1163
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:11,000
Anyhow, let's go ahead and get into some release dates for games that are coming out this week.

1164
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:15,000
Yeah, I got a good selection of games coming out this week.

1165
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:21,000
Starting things off, Witch's Tale, which is going to be coming out on DS.

1166
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:25,000
Also this week, NBA 2K10 is coming out on PC.

1167
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:27,000
I guess it got delayed from the rest of them.

1168
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:32,000
Kars Racerama pretty much coming out on everything.

1169
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:34,000
Squeeballs Party on the Wii and DS.

1170
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:39,000
You may remember this was the game that was supposed to have a Wii remote type of controller for the Xbox 360.

1171
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:41,000
That version got cancelled, unfortunately.

1172
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:44,000
But you can pick it up on the rest of the systems.

1173
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:51,000
Also, kind of a Grey's Hits edition of Midnight Club Los Angeles is coming out.

1174
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:56,000
The Complete Edition with the download content intact and for the Grey's Hits price.

1175
01:02:56,000 --> 01:03:00,000
Pets Pony Beauty Pageant for the DS.

1176
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:04,000
Sing Star Latino coming out on PlayStation 2.

1177
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:05,000
That's interesting.

1178
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:06,000
Didn't know that was coming over here.

1179
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:11,000
Ju-On, The Grudge, Haunted House Simulator for the Wii.

1180
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:13,000
Making its way out this week.

1181
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:21,000
Africa on PS3, which apparently has been getting horrible reviews.

1182
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:23,000
It's about time that game comes out, though.

1183
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:24,000
Africa.

1184
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:25,000
Yes.

1185
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:32,000
Where the Wild Things are coming out, tying with the new movie.

1186
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:36,000
That'll be on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Wii, and DS.

1187
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:38,000
Maybe PSP.

1188
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:42,000
Magna Carta 2 coming out on Xbox 360.

1189
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:45,000
Sing Star Motown coming out on PlayStation 3.

1190
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:47,000
Also another game I was unaware of.

1191
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:54,000
Heroes Saga Leviathan Tactics coming out on DS.

1192
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:59,000
Mario and Sonic at the Olympic Winter Games on the Wii and DS this week.

1193
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:04,000
Brutal Legend making its way out on Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3.

1194
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:06,000
Kind of go along with Epic Games like that.

1195
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:10,000
Uncharted 2 Among Thieves coming out this week on PlayStation 3.

1196
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:13,000
Half Minute Hero coming out on PlayStation Portable.

1197
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:15,000
That'll be pretty awesome.

1198
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:16,000
They haven't bought Fallout 3 yet.

1199
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:22,000
Fallout 3 Game of the Year Edition with all the download content with it for 60 bucks.

1200
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:25,000
That's coming out on Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, and PC.

1201
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:29,000
Way of the Samurai on Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 this week.

1202
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:34,000
Grand Theft Auto Chinatown Wars on PSP.

1203
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:38,000
Sudoku Ball Detective on the Wii.

1204
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:40,000
Buck Fever on the Wii.

1205
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:45,000
And a boy and his blob on the Wii.

1206
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:46,000
That's going to be awesome.

1207
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:47,000
Really?

1208
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:48,000
Yeah.

1209
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:49,000
Boy, that came out under the radar, didn't it?

1210
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:52,000
I actually saw something for that a little earlier today.

1211
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:56,000
I thought I'd seen something on one of the blogs, but I got the impression this game was still in development.

1212
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:58,000
I didn't realize it was coming out now.

1213
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:00,000
It's ready to go.

1214
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:01,000
Interesting.

1215
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:05,000
Agatha Christie's ABC Murders coming out on DS this week.

1216
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:06,000
Woohoo.

1217
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:07,000
Yeah.

1218
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:10,000
Hope Angela Lansbury does some voice acting in that.

1219
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:12,000
I'm a big fan.

1220
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:13,000
And that's it.

1221
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:14,000
All right.

1222
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:16,000
Japanese release dates are not here this week.

1223
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:18,000
We'll get back to those next week.

1224
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:23,000
So apologies to those folks looking for the releases in Japan, but my resource is not working right now.

1225
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:26,000
So we'll have to just skip over to Euro release dates, right, Jimmy?

1226
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:32,000
Well, what we have is Brutal Legend on the 16th for PS3 and Xbox 360.

1227
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:35,000
Harvest Fishing, yay.

1228
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:41,000
Magna Carta 2, Mario and Luigi Bowser's Inside Story, which actually that sounds pretty fun to me.

1229
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:45,000
Playing as a big old lizard guy.

1230
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:47,000
Playing inside of him.

1231
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:48,000
Yeah.

1232
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:50,000
The nose and rump command.

1233
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:52,000
That sounds funny.

1234
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:56,000
Mario and Sonic at the Olympic Winter Games on the 16th.

1235
01:05:56,000 --> 01:06:02,000
And Ninja Captains, as well as Tropico 3.

1236
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:07,000
Oh, and also Uncharted 2 among thieves.

1237
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:10,000
That we all are.

1238
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:12,000
I'm hearing great things about Uncharted 2.

1239
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:14,000
I just want to say great, great things.

1240
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:15,000
Uncharted.

1241
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:17,000
I want to kind of check it out.

1242
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:18,000
This looks...

1243
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:24,000
I'm looking at more of the stuff from the Mario and Luigi Bowser's Inside Story.

1244
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:26,000
That actually looks pretty cute.

1245
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:28,000
Well, those Mario and Luigi games were always fun.

1246
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:30,000
I feel like they've kind of like really milked that series.

1247
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:34,000
But, you know, they've always been a good kind of role playing game for the DS.

1248
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:37,000
Yeah.

1249
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:41,000
Okay, so you may not be having trouble with your vision.

1250
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:44,000
But hey, who says that you can't improve upon what you already have?

1251
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:49,000
And apparently a company that makes gaming glasses is looking to do that.

1252
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:52,000
The new glasses are called Gunner Optics.

1253
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:55,000
And they're designed to improve your gaming performance.

1254
01:06:55,000 --> 01:07:01,000
Apparently they have some special coating and tints to them.

1255
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:07,000
And apparently they do everything from reducing glare to blocking out evaporative air currents.

1256
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:09,000
Okay.

1257
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:12,000
Basically, to me, they look like shooting glasses.

1258
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:14,000
But just with a fancier frame.

1259
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:16,000
They kind of have that same yellow tint to them.

1260
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:17,000
The prices are $100.

1261
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:20,000
And apparently Ars Technica took them out for a test drive.

1262
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:23,000
And actually found out that they do what they say.

1263
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:27,000
And actually did have an effect during prolonged gaming sessions.

1264
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:31,000
Whether that's worth the $100 or not is, I guess, your decision.

1265
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:33,000
But they look neat.

1266
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:36,000
You know, I guess a little bit geek chic.

1267
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:37,000
I don't know.

1268
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:40,000
Maybe if I, I don't know, that might look good in glasses.

1269
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:43,000
I'm not going to drop $100 on glasses, though.

1270
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:44,000
Let me see these.

1271
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:48,000
Well, you know, a good pair of regular glasses will cost you several hundred dollars.

1272
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:49,000
So, you know.

1273
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:51,000
Mine cost $430.

1274
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:53,000
That's why people have vision insurance, but.

1275
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:58,000
And if it's just yellow tint, I have yellow tinted glasses I bought for $10 that are basically

1276
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:01,000
this same thing, except without the fancy frame.

1277
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:04,000
And, you know, maybe I should try those.

1278
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:06,000
Except I don't like running around with those, because.

1279
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:09,000
Well, didn't some big website put this on a study and vouch for it?

1280
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:10,000
I mean, so.

1281
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:11,000
Yeah.

1282
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:12,000
There's got to be something more there, Loki.

1283
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:15,000
I don't think this is something you can just get the tinted lens at the 98 cent clearance

1284
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:17,000
center and run with, you know.

1285
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:20,000
Well, not necessarily those, but like, you know, shooting glasses.

1286
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:27,000
I bought them for Airsofting, but they're dangerous to wear Airsofting, because, you

1287
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:31,000
know, those BBs can bounce underneath them, and that's not good, so you need like full

1288
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:32,000
face goggles.

1289
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:36,000
But I did buy them, and they worked okay, you know, because they didn't fog up, and

1290
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:37,000
that was positive to me.

1291
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:42,000
But after wearing them for an extended period of time, your eyes kind of hurt because everything's

1292
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:45,000
like a yellow tint, and you take them off, and you're like, what?

1293
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:46,000
Colors other than yellow.

1294
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:48,000
What the hell?

1295
01:08:48,000 --> 01:09:12,620
Well, according to Tiger Claw in our chat room, chat.orange

1296
01:09:12,620 --> 01:09:16,620
on twitter.com, apparently Dead Pixel Live, another show here on allgames.com, had an

1297
01:09:16,620 --> 01:09:18,120
awesome day.

1298
01:09:18,120 --> 01:09:19,120
Alright, anyhow.

1299
01:09:19,120 --> 01:09:22,620
Moving on to one more game news story here, and then we're getting to the classic game

1300
01:09:22,620 --> 01:09:24,620
of the week.

1301
01:09:24,620 --> 01:09:27,080
PSP Minis.

1302
01:09:27,080 --> 01:09:28,940
You know, these are coming out now.

1303
01:09:28,940 --> 01:09:33,380
You saw kind of the first wave of these hit when the PSP Go came out, but something that

1304
01:09:33,380 --> 01:09:40,000
PSP Minis are having to account for in their price point, the ESRB ratings apparently are

1305
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:43,860
setting these developers back $2,500.

1306
01:09:43,860 --> 01:09:49,000
So you might see a game here on a PSP that you see on the iPhone as well, and it costs

1307
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:52,720
more on the PSP, and the whole reason why is the ESRB.

1308
01:09:52,720 --> 01:09:58,320
And something I didn't think of before is that the ESRB, you don't have to get a rating

1309
01:09:58,320 --> 01:10:01,720
from that for the iPhone game, surprisingly enough.

1310
01:10:01,720 --> 01:10:04,800
Isn't that something you think that's going to come to a head later on?

1311
01:10:04,800 --> 01:10:08,040
Like isn't that just a bag of uh-oh waiting to be open?

1312
01:10:08,040 --> 01:10:12,560
No, not really, because if you think about it, they kind of go through their own review

1313
01:10:12,560 --> 01:10:18,600
process through Apple, and really it's Apple as a platform that determines whether they

1314
01:10:18,600 --> 01:10:22,380
want to put games on their platform that have an ESRB rating or not.

1315
01:10:22,380 --> 01:10:26,800
And if they say, yeah, we'll take whatever, even if it doesn't have a rating or not, then

1316
01:10:26,800 --> 01:10:29,880
there's really nothing the ESRB can do.

1317
01:10:29,880 --> 01:10:34,200
Although it should be noted the ESRB is the president, I'm sorry, I do want to mention

1318
01:10:34,200 --> 01:10:38,360
this, the president has been on record saying not that long ago that Apple should be going

1319
01:10:38,360 --> 01:10:39,640
to their rating system for the iPhone.

1320
01:10:39,640 --> 01:10:41,560
Well, of course, they want the $2,500.

1321
01:10:41,560 --> 01:10:45,680
They want money for all those ratings and stuff, but you know what, if they don't want

1322
01:10:45,680 --> 01:10:50,800
to do it, and they don't have to do it, so to hell with you.

1323
01:10:50,800 --> 01:10:55,320
Interesting point from xlink in chat, kids don't have an iPhone, adults do.

1324
01:10:55,320 --> 01:10:56,320
But what about-

1325
01:10:56,320 --> 01:10:57,320
I know kids with iPhones.

1326
01:10:57,320 --> 01:10:58,320
Yeah.

1327
01:10:58,320 --> 01:10:59,320
What the hell are you talking about?

1328
01:10:59,320 --> 01:11:00,320
What about an iTouch, too?

1329
01:11:00,320 --> 01:11:02,640
I mean, he makes a good point that an iTouch, you don't have to have a phone contract for.

1330
01:11:02,640 --> 01:11:03,640
That sounds dirty, Rob.

1331
01:11:03,640 --> 01:11:04,640
Well, that's true, though.

1332
01:11:04,640 --> 01:11:05,640
The apps are for the iTouch, too.

1333
01:11:05,640 --> 01:11:07,080
It's an iPod Touch.

1334
01:11:07,080 --> 01:11:11,320
At least they don't have a kids version called iTouch Kids, because that would be bad.

1335
01:11:11,320 --> 01:11:12,320
Fine.

1336
01:11:12,320 --> 01:11:13,320
iPod Touch.

1337
01:11:13,320 --> 01:11:14,320
Sorry.

1338
01:11:14,320 --> 01:11:15,320
I thought it was an iTouch.

1339
01:11:15,320 --> 01:11:16,320
Whatever.

1340
01:11:16,320 --> 01:11:17,320
Shut up.

1341
01:11:17,320 --> 01:11:18,320
All right.

1342
01:11:18,320 --> 01:11:19,320
I got to do a story.

1343
01:11:19,320 --> 01:11:20,320
Yes.

1344
01:11:20,320 --> 01:11:21,320
I know.

1345
01:11:21,320 --> 01:11:22,320
What's that?

1346
01:11:22,320 --> 01:11:23,320
Down the line.

1347
01:11:23,320 --> 01:11:24,320
I can't shut up yet.

1348
01:11:24,320 --> 01:11:25,320
No.

1349
01:11:25,320 --> 01:11:26,320
All right.

1350
01:11:26,320 --> 01:11:30,600
Anyhow, I just wanted to say, though, real quick, that if you wonder why the PSP Minis

1351
01:11:30,600 --> 01:11:35,020
are more expensive, that is something the developers are citing as kind of their excuse,

1352
01:11:35,020 --> 01:11:36,200
for lack of a better term.

1353
01:11:36,200 --> 01:11:37,560
So there you go.

1354
01:11:37,560 --> 01:11:38,560
All right.

1355
01:11:38,560 --> 01:11:42,280
So we're going to get into another segment we like to do here on Orange Lounge Radio.

1356
01:11:42,280 --> 01:11:45,480
Every week is kind of our Part B segment, so to speak.

1357
01:11:45,480 --> 01:11:49,920
And it's a part where Dark Sakura gets to climb through her gaming vault and find a

1358
01:11:49,920 --> 01:11:53,280
game that, you know what, she thinks you guys ought to be playing.

1359
01:11:53,280 --> 01:11:58,400
And this is a segment we like to call the Classic Video Game of the Week.

1360
01:11:58,400 --> 01:12:04,080
Oh, Dark Sakura, what should the kids be playing this week?

1361
01:12:04,080 --> 01:12:07,080
Well, this is a game that I have admitted to everybody.

1362
01:12:07,080 --> 01:12:08,080
I have not played it.

1363
01:12:08,080 --> 01:12:09,080
I have seen it.

1364
01:12:09,080 --> 01:12:10,080
No, I take it back.

1365
01:12:10,080 --> 01:12:11,080
I started it once.

1366
01:12:11,080 --> 01:12:16,640
But people have suggested it to me, and earlier today, a friend of mine suggested it to me

1367
01:12:16,640 --> 01:12:17,640
as well.

1368
01:12:17,640 --> 01:12:19,720
Megzi suggested it.

1369
01:12:19,720 --> 01:12:23,200
Is Super Mario RPG Legend of the Seven Stars?

1370
01:12:23,200 --> 01:12:25,480
Well, it's about time.

1371
01:12:25,480 --> 01:12:28,640
This is a classic game, Dark Sakura, even if you somehow missed it.

1372
01:12:28,640 --> 01:12:30,960
This is definitely one of the all-time classic games.

1373
01:12:30,960 --> 01:12:35,440
In fact, a game that I was surprised we have never featured here on the Classic Game of

1374
01:12:35,440 --> 01:12:36,440
the Week segment.

1375
01:12:36,440 --> 01:12:44,080
So, I am going to play some music from it for you right now as soon as the website cooperates,

1376
01:12:44,080 --> 01:12:45,560
which it is not right now.

1377
01:12:45,560 --> 01:12:48,080
I'm not doing anything extra internet-y.

1378
01:12:48,080 --> 01:12:49,080
We may not.

1379
01:12:49,080 --> 01:12:50,080
There we go.

1380
01:12:50,080 --> 01:12:53,760
I just picked random level music.

1381
01:12:53,760 --> 01:13:03,520
Anyway, Super Mario RPG is an sort of adventure and role-playing game that's put out by Square

1382
01:13:03,520 --> 01:13:06,040
back in the day and Nintendo.

1383
01:13:06,040 --> 01:13:12,040
It came out in Japan on March 9th, 1996, and on May 13th, 1996, in North America.

1384
01:13:12,040 --> 01:13:14,660
Europe did not get it.

1385
01:13:14,660 --> 01:13:21,960
Not until it came out on the Virtual Console, August 22nd, 2008, which, according to this

1386
01:13:21,960 --> 01:13:29,120
reference, is the longest difference in time between release dates in Nintendo's history.

1387
01:13:29,120 --> 01:13:30,120
I had to change the YouTube.

1388
01:13:30,120 --> 01:13:34,960
Sorry, the other one wasn't loading right, so here we go.

1389
01:13:34,960 --> 01:13:47,440
Anyway, this was made pretty much all in-house by Square with guidance from Miyamoto, so

1390
01:13:47,440 --> 01:13:49,440
big deal.

1391
01:13:49,440 --> 01:13:52,960
The battle system in this game was pretty cool.

1392
01:13:52,960 --> 01:14:00,760
It's very similar to Chrono Trigger so that it's action-based, but you don't necessarily

1393
01:14:00,760 --> 01:14:04,240
just stick in your monster battles.

1394
01:14:04,240 --> 01:14:11,920
It does play rather isometrically, and you can see your enemies, and you can't, you know,

1395
01:14:11,920 --> 01:14:18,880
you don't fight with one until you run into one, so that's what I mean by Chrono Trigger-like.

1396
01:14:18,880 --> 01:14:23,320
But with your battle system, you can play Mario, Mallow, Geno, Bowser, or Princess Toadstool.

1397
01:14:23,320 --> 01:14:30,640
They all, of course, have their own attacks, and it is turn-based, this traditional turn-based

1398
01:14:30,640 --> 01:14:42,880
system, but you do have timed button presses, where how you do your commands determines

1399
01:14:42,880 --> 01:14:50,160
how your results come out, so pretty cool, and of course you have items and stuff.

1400
01:14:50,160 --> 01:14:58,480
But yeah, with the game, you go visit all the Toad people, and you have Moleville, and

1401
01:14:58,480 --> 01:15:05,640
a monster town, and you have the Yoshi town, and you have the cloud place called Nimbus

1402
01:15:05,640 --> 01:15:14,400
Land where the cloud people live, and Bowser's castle, and all this other crazy stuff, but

1403
01:15:14,400 --> 01:15:19,680
you play, but yeah, there are some original characters on there, I mean, not just, you

1404
01:15:19,680 --> 01:15:26,960
know, Mario and Toadstool and Bowser who come from the other games, but you have Mallow

1405
01:15:26,960 --> 01:15:37,520
who is a cloud boy who thinks he's a tadpole, and Geno who is possessed by a creature from

1406
01:15:37,520 --> 01:15:45,240
the star road, and then, of course, Bowser and his little friends, so that's the game.

1407
01:15:45,240 --> 01:15:46,400
Pretty cool.

1408
01:15:46,400 --> 01:15:52,800
It's got its own fun look, and its own fun music, and also though, this is, I've mentioned

1409
01:15:52,800 --> 01:15:59,600
this before, but it's one of the only three games that came outside of Japan that used

1410
01:15:59,600 --> 01:16:08,440
the Nintendo SA1, the others being Kirby Superstar and Kirby's Dream Land 3, so basically, and

1411
01:16:08,440 --> 01:16:14,520
this was another microprocessor, but it had allowed a higher clock speed, faster RAM,

1412
01:16:14,520 --> 01:16:21,440
greater memory mapping, data storage compression, new DMA modes such as bitmap to bitplane,

1413
01:16:21,440 --> 01:16:26,400
and builds in CIC lockout, so, pretty cool.

1414
01:16:26,400 --> 01:16:36,880
Oh yeah, it had different sound effects that used the SBC 700, so that was pretty cool.

1415
01:16:36,880 --> 01:16:41,600
This game was really advanced for when it came out, so.

1416
01:16:41,600 --> 01:16:44,360
Alright, well there you go.

1417
01:16:44,360 --> 01:16:49,920
Super Mario RPG finally, after all this time, gets highlighted on our show here, although

1418
01:16:49,920 --> 01:16:53,880
we've talked about it very fondly before, even if Dark Sakura somehow missed it.

1419
01:16:53,880 --> 01:16:57,480
That's okay, you know what, I played it a little bit, I like rented it once, and played

1420
01:16:57,480 --> 01:17:01,040
the crap out of it for like five days, and then, you know, sent it back, but I never

1421
01:17:01,040 --> 01:17:02,040
beat the game.

1422
01:17:02,040 --> 01:17:05,040
Loki, on the other hand, I know this is one of his all-time favorites, if I'm not mistaken,

1423
01:17:05,040 --> 01:17:06,040
right?

1424
01:17:06,040 --> 01:17:07,040
Hell yeah, I finished the game.

1425
01:17:07,040 --> 01:17:10,400
Alright, I see some people in chat calling it a good entry-level RPG, and a lot of folks

1426
01:17:10,400 --> 01:17:14,840
in chat really like this as the classic game of the week, so there you go.

1427
01:17:14,840 --> 01:17:16,840
Super Mario RPG, the classic game of the week.

1428
01:17:16,840 --> 01:17:20,440
Alright, that's gonna do it for this part A of Orange Lawns Radio tonight, but don't

1429
01:17:20,440 --> 01:17:23,800
go anywhere, because when we come back in part B, we have your Twitter topics, some

1430
01:17:23,800 --> 01:17:29,080
rapid-fire news tonight, and some news about Facebook and Twitter on Xbox Live, some dates

1431
01:17:29,080 --> 01:17:33,480
for when you can expect to see that, and Rock Band, coming to the iPhone.

1432
01:17:33,480 --> 01:17:38,600
We talked a little bit about iPhone games, now a big, big title is coming its way to

1433
01:17:38,600 --> 01:17:42,480
the iPhone, so we'll be kind of talking about if folks are looking forward to that, or if

1434
01:17:42,480 --> 01:17:44,020
this just sounds like shit.

1435
01:17:44,020 --> 01:17:48,400
We'll talk about that all in a little bit when we come back with more of Orange Lounge

1436
01:17:48,400 --> 01:17:55,720
Radio, so stay tuned.

1437
01:17:55,720 --> 01:18:00,760
And welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio, live on this October 11th, 2009, here

1438
01:18:00,760 --> 01:18:07,360
for episode number 340 of our weekly podcast, which we've taped since May, I'm sorry, June

1439
01:18:07,360 --> 01:18:10,040
of 2002.

1440
01:18:10,040 --> 01:18:13,320
During the break there, something I don't think we've done in quite some time in the

1441
01:18:13,320 --> 01:18:18,320
history of our show, Loki actually played a game live and provided us all of the break

1442
01:18:18,320 --> 01:18:20,560
music tonight, and we played some DJ Hero.

1443
01:18:20,560 --> 01:18:24,560
I am so sorry to the podcast listeners, but due to copyright restrictions, we can't play

1444
01:18:24,560 --> 01:18:28,480
any more than we did in part A for you guys, although I hear guys in our chat room were

1445
01:18:28,480 --> 01:18:34,600
bootlegging that, and we don't condone that, but if you know who to talk to, there's really

1446
01:18:34,600 --> 01:18:37,840
nothing we can do about it if some of those bootlegs get out, so there you go.

1447
01:18:37,840 --> 01:18:41,520
But I posed a question to chat, what you guys thought of that, and we were talking here

1448
01:18:41,520 --> 01:18:45,720
in the studio, the soundtrack's really hot, that third song, especially the Satisfaction

1449
01:18:45,720 --> 01:18:51,040
versus Boom Boom Pow, the Black Eyed Peas are kind of hit and miss for me, I think they

1450
01:18:51,040 --> 01:18:55,280
play them way too much on the radio and you kind of get sick of them, but I love how these

1451
01:18:55,280 --> 01:19:01,160
songs give a whole new look to these songs, and even some folks in chat were saying about

1452
01:19:01,160 --> 01:19:05,160
that Hollaback Girl song, that's the best they've ever heard that song.

1453
01:19:05,160 --> 01:19:10,320
And not everything in those songs were just a part of the soundtrack, you were actually

1454
01:19:10,320 --> 01:19:13,120
rewinding, you were doing the freestyle horns, right?

1455
01:19:13,120 --> 01:19:16,800
Freestyle, and then also there's parts where you can distort it, and I was using the Effector

1456
01:19:16,800 --> 01:19:20,800
dial on there to distort some of the tracks in there too.

1457
01:19:20,800 --> 01:19:23,740
So there's a lot of stuff that you can kind of add on top of it, and actually there's

1458
01:19:23,740 --> 01:19:27,800
a port in there where you can add a microphone too, I think a headset microphone, if you

1459
01:19:27,800 --> 01:19:33,160
want to talk over stuff, but that's tough enough, but yeah, I did screw up a few spots

1460
01:19:33,160 --> 01:19:38,480
where it dropped out, it's really touchy, it's sensitive to where, and the scratches

1461
01:19:38,480 --> 01:19:43,360
too early sometimes, but it's fun, and we'll have to definitely do it again once we get

1462
01:19:43,360 --> 01:19:44,880
the full game.

1463
01:19:44,880 --> 01:19:49,000
Now Bobby does want me to say in chat, obviously All Games Radio would prefer no bootlegs be

1464
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:53,920
released as we could be held liable just saying, yeah, so obviously I was kidding before, so

1465
01:19:53,920 --> 01:19:57,440
don't release bootlegs because we don't want the fine folks to host our show here.

1466
01:19:57,440 --> 01:20:01,560
A lot of these songs I think are already out there, like in numerous gameplay clips.

1467
01:20:01,560 --> 01:20:07,440
I was commenting that I think that the Hollaback Boy Girl would and whatever, that I have a

1468
01:20:07,440 --> 01:20:11,660
very similar mashup on a disc that I bought in Berkeley.

1469
01:20:11,660 --> 01:20:15,200
And honestly this is all just promotion for Activision anyway, because honestly if I wasn't

1470
01:20:15,200 --> 01:20:19,760
sold on this game already, I am fucking buying this day one now, so, and I think a lot of

1471
01:20:19,760 --> 01:20:23,280
folks in chat that were skeptical about the soundtrack have probably, you know, for the

1472
01:20:23,280 --> 01:20:28,600
most part been overwhelmingly approved, so we've done a good thing for Activision here,

1473
01:20:28,600 --> 01:20:32,720
but still for legal reasons, yeah, we said what we said.

1474
01:20:32,720 --> 01:20:37,640
So, let's see, what else, yeah, DJ Dark Knight says don't copy that floppy.

1475
01:20:37,640 --> 01:20:44,160
Back to the songs, let's see, Cheeseburger does say sorry but I hate those songs set

1476
01:20:44,160 --> 01:20:47,880
for the synth in Satisfaction, which is a part of the original song anyway.

1477
01:20:47,880 --> 01:20:51,160
There's, well they have a lot of stuff, like there's some hip hop songs in there that I'm

1478
01:20:51,160 --> 01:20:55,960
not going to be too excited to play, but you know, there's a lot of songs like this, like

1479
01:20:55,960 --> 01:20:59,120
the Daft Punk stuff, I'm all over the Daft Punk stuff, that's going to be awesome.

1480
01:20:59,120 --> 01:21:01,960
And of course we have downloadable stuff on the horizon too, right?

1481
01:21:01,960 --> 01:21:02,960
Yeah.

1482
01:21:02,960 --> 01:21:03,960
Eventually.

1483
01:21:03,960 --> 01:21:04,960
Eventually.

1484
01:21:04,960 --> 01:21:05,960
Yeah.

1485
01:21:05,960 --> 01:21:06,960
Hopefully so.

1486
01:21:06,960 --> 01:21:07,960
Hopefully there's a lot.

1487
01:21:07,960 --> 01:21:08,960
This game looks pretty hot.

1488
01:21:08,960 --> 01:21:13,560
I'm a little sad I didn't get to play, but even just watching was fun, so there you go.

1489
01:21:13,560 --> 01:21:14,560
So, alright.

1490
01:21:14,560 --> 01:21:18,960
Well, we do have plenty more going on in the world than just DJ Hero and part of that is

1491
01:21:18,960 --> 01:21:24,480
going to the Twitter and reading some of your Twitter topics for tonight.

1492
01:21:24,480 --> 01:21:30,280
And there's a lot of DJ Hero talk on our Twitter feed right now, but we do have some questions.

1493
01:21:30,280 --> 01:21:32,200
Let's get to some quick Twitter topics tonight.

1494
01:21:32,200 --> 01:21:37,760
Ryan Belknap on Twitter at Twitter.com slash O-L-R. Uh oh, I have the hiccups, worst thing

1495
01:21:37,760 --> 01:21:38,760
in radio to have.

1496
01:21:38,760 --> 01:21:42,840
Excuse me, wants to know, what do you think about all of the games that were pushed back

1497
01:21:42,840 --> 01:21:43,840
over the last month?

1498
01:21:43,840 --> 01:21:45,160
Will they be worth the wait?

1499
01:21:45,160 --> 01:21:46,160
Loki?

1500
01:21:46,160 --> 01:21:50,240
There's a lot that I was waiting for to come out that have been pushed back, like Red Dead

1501
01:21:50,240 --> 01:21:54,680
to Redemption, which I'm very excited to play because it's Grand Theft Auto in the Wild

1502
01:21:54,680 --> 01:21:56,480
West.

1503
01:21:56,480 --> 01:22:02,200
And also, I'm trying to think of other stuff I was waiting for that are, I'm kind of glad

1504
01:22:02,200 --> 01:22:05,880
a lot of it's been pushed back because I don't have the money to buy all these right now.

1505
01:22:05,880 --> 01:22:11,420
Like I'll be picking up Borderlands probably in two weeks, I'll be picking up DJ Hero hopefully

1506
01:22:11,420 --> 01:22:14,820
earlier than that.

1507
01:22:14,820 --> 01:22:18,920
And I think those two right there are going to pretty much wrap up my year as far as what

1508
01:22:18,920 --> 01:22:26,060
I'm buying, you know, Left 4 Dead, well maybe New Super Mario Brothers, I'm on the fence

1509
01:22:26,060 --> 01:22:32,560
with that, like probably won't buy it, but you know, at least DJ Hero and Borderlands

1510
01:22:32,560 --> 01:22:35,960
are the two that I'm looking forward to right now, but there's a lot of stuff that's coming

1511
01:22:35,960 --> 01:22:41,920
out like Dead Rising 2 next year, just a ton of stuff that was coming out this fourth quarter

1512
01:22:41,920 --> 01:22:43,360
that's now pushed back.

1513
01:22:43,360 --> 01:22:46,560
I'm okay with games getting pushed back because honestly I have barely enough time to play

1514
01:22:46,560 --> 01:22:50,120
the games that are out there already, especially when you have a game like Demon's Souls, it's

1515
01:22:50,120 --> 01:22:53,440
going to take me 100 hours just to get to level 2.

1516
01:22:53,440 --> 01:22:57,720
You know, there's not, my gaming time's kind of spread out, but then again 2010's just

1517
01:22:57,720 --> 01:22:58,720
going to look worse.

1518
01:22:58,720 --> 01:23:01,640
I was looking forward to Blur, I'm kind of sad that that game got pushed back, but you

1519
01:23:01,640 --> 01:23:04,600
know, DJ Hero's going to be really cool and there's still some stuff coming out.

1520
01:23:04,600 --> 01:23:07,520
And some of the games I bought already are really taking my time.

1521
01:23:07,520 --> 01:23:13,560
So, Gamer Girl on Twitter wants to know, what's anyone's favorite video game soundtrack?

1522
01:23:13,560 --> 01:23:15,360
Favorite video game soundtrack?

1523
01:23:15,360 --> 01:23:18,940
Beatmania 2DX 5th style is one of my favorites.

1524
01:23:18,940 --> 01:23:23,760
I can't really think about the dancing games, the music games, considering.

1525
01:23:23,760 --> 01:23:28,520
So I'm going to say that as far as a soundtrack that I can just sit and listen to over and

1526
01:23:28,520 --> 01:23:32,000
over again, probably, um, Klonoa.

1527
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:33,000
Hmm.

1528
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:34,000
Okay.

1529
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:35,440
Klonoa or Chrono Trigger.

1530
01:23:35,440 --> 01:23:36,440
Good choice.

1531
01:23:36,440 --> 01:23:41,180
I would, I'm going to be just total stereotypical and go with the Final Fantasy series.

1532
01:23:41,180 --> 01:23:44,240
Just because the Final Fantasy, you know, especially series like Final Fantasy XI,

1533
01:23:44,240 --> 01:23:47,480
you know, you do listen to that music so often when you play those games that it has to have

1534
01:23:47,480 --> 01:23:51,880
good music, so I would say a game like Final Fantasy XI or probably my favorite soundtrack

1535
01:23:51,880 --> 01:23:54,360
in the entire series was VI, Final Fantasy VI.

1536
01:23:54,360 --> 01:24:00,600
I'd have to go with VI, although the spin-off soundtracks were pretty good, like, um, Final

1537
01:24:00,600 --> 01:24:02,480
Fantasy, Prey, and Celtic Moon.

1538
01:24:02,480 --> 01:24:03,480
Both fantastic.

1539
01:24:03,480 --> 01:24:05,760
Loki, any favorites for you?

1540
01:24:05,760 --> 01:24:14,480
Um, I don't know, like, I'd say maybe DDR 5th or Max 2 would probably be my favorite

1541
01:24:14,480 --> 01:24:15,480
soundtracks.

1542
01:24:15,480 --> 01:24:18,440
Um, Katamari's pretty good.

1543
01:24:18,440 --> 01:24:20,240
I don't know.

1544
01:24:20,240 --> 01:24:22,960
Spazinator has two quick topics for us.

1545
01:24:22,960 --> 01:24:25,880
Your video game related pet peeves.

1546
01:24:25,880 --> 01:24:30,060
Mine would be, um, arcades replacing arcade machines with redemption machines.

1547
01:24:30,060 --> 01:24:31,720
That's a pet peeve of mine.

1548
01:24:31,720 --> 01:24:35,280
I mean, I understand why it's happening, but it's still a pet peeve.

1549
01:24:35,280 --> 01:24:38,820
Mine are programmed in quarter drainers for arcades.

1550
01:24:38,820 --> 01:24:47,760
For console, um, it would be, um, oh, you know, I really don't know.

1551
01:24:47,760 --> 01:24:49,400
Probably bad voice acting.

1552
01:24:49,400 --> 01:24:54,600
Um, my other pet peeve would be Xbox Live Griefers, just the people on there and go,

1553
01:24:54,600 --> 01:24:59,360
you know, NNNFFF, you know, you know what I mean.

1554
01:24:59,360 --> 01:25:03,440
Fixing stuff that doesn't need to be fixed or just, you know, not adding features that

1555
01:25:03,440 --> 01:25:05,100
should be completely simple to add.

1556
01:25:05,100 --> 01:25:11,520
For example, Grand Theft Auto 4, um, the multiplayer, you can set your time limits, you know, for

1557
01:25:11,520 --> 01:25:19,360
5, 10, 15 minutes, 20 minutes, 30 minutes, and then it jumps to 45 minutes.

1558
01:25:19,360 --> 01:25:22,760
If you want to play a 35 minute game, you have to play two games, and it's annoying.

1559
01:25:22,760 --> 01:25:26,440
Like in Saints Row, you can play anything from a 1 minute long game to a 60 minute game

1560
01:25:26,440 --> 01:25:29,520
and just set it any amount of time in between, and I don't understand why they have to take

1561
01:25:29,520 --> 01:25:30,520
that out.

1562
01:25:30,520 --> 01:25:33,960
Or, when they updated for Lost and Damned, let's remove the helicopters out of free mode.

1563
01:25:33,960 --> 01:25:35,320
Yeah, that's an awesome idea.

1564
01:25:35,320 --> 01:25:36,320
Why the hell did you do that?

1565
01:25:36,320 --> 01:25:37,880
It's just, there's no point.

1566
01:25:37,880 --> 01:25:41,480
Uh, we'll let Spaznator have a second question here on Twitter Topics tonight, because he

1567
01:25:41,480 --> 01:25:45,280
managed to fit two questions in 140 characters, so we'll let him do it.

1568
01:25:45,280 --> 01:25:48,880
What each console and their respective services can do to improve.

1569
01:25:48,880 --> 01:25:50,840
What could each console do to improve?

1570
01:25:50,840 --> 01:25:53,720
Anyone want to tackle this first?

1571
01:25:53,720 --> 01:25:55,400
What can each console do to improve?

1572
01:25:55,400 --> 01:25:56,400
Yeah, what could the Wii do?

1573
01:25:56,400 --> 01:25:57,400
What could the 360 do?

1574
01:25:57,400 --> 01:25:58,840
What could the PS3 do?

1575
01:25:58,840 --> 01:26:03,700
Well, the Wii, first of all, could have online play.

1576
01:26:03,700 --> 01:26:09,800
The Xbox 360 can, I don't know, they're pretty damn awesome.

1577
01:26:09,800 --> 01:26:12,080
I guess have better filters.

1578
01:26:12,080 --> 01:26:15,760
And the PS3 can be a different system.

1579
01:26:15,760 --> 01:26:18,600
Loki?

1580
01:26:18,600 --> 01:26:25,040
The Wii needs an actual online something, other than just browsing a flash, not even

1581
01:26:25,040 --> 01:26:28,800
a flash, like a JavaScript store for games and stuff.

1582
01:26:28,800 --> 01:26:33,560
They need something more substantial, like the PlayStation Network and Xbox Live.

1583
01:26:33,560 --> 01:26:37,600
PlayStation Network needs more download content on there, as far as game releases and stuff

1584
01:26:37,600 --> 01:26:44,520
like that, because Xbox Live has at least one or two new games coming out each week.

1585
01:26:44,520 --> 01:26:48,920
You'd be lucky to find that over on the PlayStation Network, and I understand that they have PlayStation

1586
01:26:48,920 --> 01:26:53,360
Originals and stuff like that, but come on, a little bit more and more demos for that

1587
01:26:53,360 --> 01:26:55,000
kind of stuff.

1588
01:26:55,000 --> 01:27:04,200
And then Xbox Live, I would say probably a way to purchase stuff where I don't have to

1589
01:27:04,200 --> 01:27:08,760
just buy points in a big lot, like how the PlayStation Network has it, if the purchase

1590
01:27:08,760 --> 01:27:13,200
is over $5, I can pay for the exact amount and be done with it, and that'd be nice, instead

1591
01:27:13,200 --> 01:27:15,360
of having all these extra points lying around.

1592
01:27:15,360 --> 01:27:19,360
I hate doing the point conversion crap.

1593
01:27:19,360 --> 01:27:22,640
I definitely have the definitive answers, in my opinion, for these three consoles.

1594
01:27:22,640 --> 01:27:27,700
The Wii needs to embrace online, period, Nintendo needs to stop being afraid of online and see

1595
01:27:27,700 --> 01:27:32,980
how it can work for them in large doses, but I honestly don't think the Wii can be remedied

1596
01:27:32,980 --> 01:27:33,980
in its current state.

1597
01:27:33,980 --> 01:27:37,320
I think it is what it is, I think it's been pigeon-holed for what it is, it's not necessarily

1598
01:27:37,320 --> 01:27:40,920
a bad thing, it is the number one console in America right now, whether we like it or

1599
01:27:40,920 --> 01:27:45,980
not as hardcore gamers, but I would say if they want to woo the hardcore gamers back,

1600
01:27:45,980 --> 01:27:50,420
they're going to need to fix some things with Wii HD, which we all know is inevitable.

1601
01:27:50,420 --> 01:27:52,880
Question three, I couldn't disagree with Dark Sakura more.

1602
01:27:52,880 --> 01:27:57,200
I think they did exactly what they needed to do this year, and that was drop the price

1603
01:27:57,200 --> 01:28:00,800
to a reasonable point, and I think they're on a path for success right now.

1604
01:28:00,800 --> 01:28:03,240
I think the PS3's been doing a lot right this year.

1605
01:28:03,240 --> 01:28:05,640
PSP Go, completely different story.

1606
01:28:05,640 --> 01:28:09,920
PS3, I think, is a console I would recommend to friends this Christmas.

1607
01:28:09,920 --> 01:28:14,320
The biggest thing they could do now, focus on working, selling those consoles, and getting

1608
01:28:14,320 --> 01:28:17,760
more exclusives would be the biggest thing they could do right now.

1609
01:28:17,760 --> 01:28:21,400
Yeah, my PS3 is a Blu-ray player.

1610
01:28:21,400 --> 01:28:26,120
See now, I can't say that, because especially now that my 360's been broken, I've been able

1611
01:28:26,120 --> 01:28:27,840
to value the PlayStation more as-

1612
01:28:27,840 --> 01:28:34,160
Now, tell me, when your Xbox 360 is fixed, is that going to change?

1613
01:28:34,160 --> 01:28:38,200
Are you going to immediately remember everything that you liked better about the Xbox 360?

1614
01:28:38,200 --> 01:28:42,000
It'll be about half and half, because here's my thing for the 360, and yes, there will

1615
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:48,640
be games that I will buy on the PlayStation 3 over the 360, because this 360 lacks hardcore

1616
01:28:48,640 --> 01:28:53,920
in this one place, and what the 360 needs to fix, anyone?

1617
01:28:53,920 --> 01:28:57,400
The controller sucks on the Xbox 360.

1618
01:28:57,400 --> 01:28:58,800
I disagree.

1619
01:28:58,800 --> 01:28:59,800
Especially the D-pad.

1620
01:28:59,800 --> 01:29:00,800
The D-pad is ass.

1621
01:29:00,800 --> 01:29:01,800
The D-pad is horrible.

1622
01:29:01,800 --> 01:29:02,800
I disagree.

1623
01:29:02,800 --> 01:29:03,800
You can't play retro games.

1624
01:29:03,800 --> 01:29:04,800
Oh my, really?

1625
01:29:04,800 --> 01:29:05,800
Why?

1626
01:29:05,800 --> 01:29:08,960
I've had actually absolutely no problem playing on the Xbox 360.

1627
01:29:08,960 --> 01:29:13,800
The controller size, first of all, is more comfortable to the shape of my hands.

1628
01:29:13,800 --> 01:29:17,120
Why else do you think that I like the Saturn dual analog controller, even though that one

1629
01:29:17,120 --> 01:29:21,040
seemed kind of, you know, on the unwieldy side when you look at it?

1630
01:29:21,040 --> 01:29:25,520
It actually, everything, like I was playing through just a number of games and having

1631
01:29:25,520 --> 01:29:29,600
a zero problem, like, well, Dan had problems with Mr. Driller, I didn't.

1632
01:29:29,600 --> 01:29:33,740
I mean, it may just be I've got, you know, smaller hands than both of you guys, but I

1633
01:29:33,740 --> 01:29:38,700
don't really have much of a problem with playing games on the Xbox 360.

1634
01:29:38,700 --> 01:29:46,520
I actually hate a lot of the PS3 games just because, I mean, first of all, they'll rely

1635
01:29:46,520 --> 01:29:51,180
on different visual effects that the Xbox 360 just doesn't need.

1636
01:29:51,180 --> 01:29:56,120
And also, in comparison, there's certain games that are coming out, namely Bayonetta, that

1637
01:29:56,120 --> 01:30:02,360
is going to be completely utter crap on PS3 as opposed to Xbox 360, both in terms of graphics,

1638
01:30:02,360 --> 01:30:07,840
processor speed, you know, how the game functions on the system.

1639
01:30:07,840 --> 01:30:13,160
So honestly, I think that the Xbox 360 controller, to me, is more comfortable in my hands.

1640
01:30:13,160 --> 01:30:21,520
That's why I got this on Xbox 360, as in Marvel Ultimate Alliance 2, instead of PlayStation

1641
01:30:21,520 --> 01:30:27,240
3, which I've played the first one on both systems, and to this day, the control is infinitely

1642
01:30:27,240 --> 01:30:29,560
better on the Xbox 360.

1643
01:30:29,560 --> 01:30:34,360
Just playing Mega Man 9 on the 360 controller and playing it on a PS3 controller made me

1644
01:30:34,360 --> 01:30:37,160
want to just build my own 360 controller.

1645
01:30:37,160 --> 01:30:39,240
I just cannot play some games on the 360.

1646
01:30:39,240 --> 01:30:40,240
I'm not hating on Microsoft.

1647
01:30:40,240 --> 01:30:41,240
They do a lot right.

1648
01:30:41,240 --> 01:30:45,600
I mean, to be fair, if I'm picking on that, there's, I mean, 360's done a lot of brilliant

1649
01:30:45,600 --> 01:30:46,600
things this year.

1650
01:30:46,600 --> 01:30:47,860
One versus 100 was awesome.

1651
01:30:47,860 --> 01:30:52,760
They continue to lead the charge in online gaming, but, you know, if I could fix something,

1652
01:30:52,760 --> 01:30:55,080
that would be the first place to start as a new controller.

1653
01:30:55,080 --> 01:30:57,600
Well, third parties make other controllers, I think.

1654
01:30:57,600 --> 01:30:59,300
Doesn't Hori make one as well, or?

1655
01:30:59,300 --> 01:31:04,160
I don't think any of them really just radically change the design, though.

1656
01:31:04,160 --> 01:31:06,400
So anyhow.

1657
01:31:06,400 --> 01:31:09,000
And Brad, you know, you have a fan in, uh, Brad from Pod Culture.

1658
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:13,040
He says he prefers the 360 controller over the PS3 any day.

1659
01:31:13,040 --> 01:31:14,040
Yeah.

1660
01:31:14,040 --> 01:31:15,040
How about the noise of the system?

1661
01:31:15,040 --> 01:31:18,080
That would be the other thing I'd want to fix, is that when I am trying to watch Netflix

1662
01:31:18,080 --> 01:31:22,080
or movies on the 360, it sounds like Mom's running the vacuum cleaner behind me.

1663
01:31:22,080 --> 01:31:23,080
I don't notice.

1664
01:31:23,080 --> 01:31:24,080
Really?

1665
01:31:24,080 --> 01:31:26,960
Well, keep in mind how my setup is.

1666
01:31:26,960 --> 01:31:33,040
I have everything together under the, uh, the drawer on there, so really, I don't really

1667
01:31:33,040 --> 01:31:34,040
hear it.

1668
01:31:34,040 --> 01:31:40,520
The only time that I hear it is when we have the subwoofer off, and the game volume very

1669
01:31:40,520 --> 01:31:46,000
low, and my hearing is extra sensitive, or, you know, that type of thing.

1670
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:51,560
Or if, like, someone's turned off the TV and left the system on, or if the game is on pause,

1671
01:31:51,560 --> 01:31:52,560
then I hear the system.

1672
01:31:52,560 --> 01:31:55,280
But I don't really hear it when I'm playing.

1673
01:31:55,280 --> 01:32:00,240
Then again, we've got the surround sound setup and everything, too, so it's hard to hear

1674
01:32:00,240 --> 01:32:01,240
yourself breathe.

1675
01:32:01,240 --> 01:32:02,240
All right.

1676
01:32:02,240 --> 01:32:08,880
One more question here, Surtur from our Twitter wants to know, are PSP mini games too expensive?

1677
01:32:08,880 --> 01:32:13,440
Are the regular PSN download games too expensive in comparison to the UMD prices?

1678
01:32:13,440 --> 01:32:15,480
Yes and yes.

1679
01:32:15,480 --> 01:32:16,480
That's his opinion.

1680
01:32:16,480 --> 01:32:20,480
Um, for me, I don't, I can't answer this, and I doubt the others can, too.

1681
01:32:20,480 --> 01:32:22,000
I haven't played a PSP mini game yet.

1682
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:23,300
I haven't paid to download one.

1683
01:32:23,300 --> 01:32:26,560
I couldn't tell you if they're worth the money or not, so I don't know.

1684
01:32:26,560 --> 01:32:28,760
I keep forgetting they exist.

1685
01:32:28,760 --> 01:32:35,560
I do think people forget what $5 or $10 is supposed to get you.

1686
01:32:35,560 --> 01:32:42,960
And honestly, I think $10 is not that much money for a video game, and, you know, considering

1687
01:32:42,960 --> 01:32:47,560
that most games now cost $60 used, I think most of these arcade games, I mean, this goes

1688
01:32:47,560 --> 01:32:53,160
for Xbox Live and the minis or what have you, $10 for a game is not unreasonable, especially

1689
01:32:53,160 --> 01:32:55,760
if the game's good.

1690
01:32:55,760 --> 01:32:56,760
But I don't know.

1691
01:32:56,760 --> 01:32:59,000
I haven't played any PSP mini games, so I couldn't tell you.

1692
01:32:59,000 --> 01:33:03,880
As far as the regular PSN download games too expensive in comparison to UMD prices, I,

1693
01:33:03,880 --> 01:33:04,880
you know what?

1694
01:33:04,880 --> 01:33:09,240
I'm all for the PSN download thing for convenience, but I'm also all for competition, and this

1695
01:33:09,240 --> 01:33:15,200
is why I do not like the PSP Go, and I don't really care for where it's headed with games.

1696
01:33:15,200 --> 01:33:20,080
I don't like the fact that there's only one source to buy the games, and it is, you know,

1697
01:33:20,080 --> 01:33:24,720
something I haven't given a lot of thought to until the system was released, but competition

1698
01:33:24,720 --> 01:33:30,160
is usually a pretty healthy thing, and, you know, if this digital distribution thing keeps

1699
01:33:30,160 --> 01:33:35,520
going and, you know, online is the only place we're able to buy games, that is, through

1700
01:33:35,520 --> 01:33:40,560
Sony or through Microsoft in the future, if they do something similar, that's gonna be

1701
01:33:40,560 --> 01:33:44,960
a little worrisome, because competition right now is what keeps things awesome.

1702
01:33:44,960 --> 01:33:51,600
What's a website like CheapAssGamer gonna do if all the consoles go digital distribution?

1703
01:33:51,600 --> 01:33:55,960
There's always gonna be older stuff that's out there, so, and I don't think it's ever

1704
01:33:55,960 --> 01:34:02,040
gonna go away completely, because GameStop's not gonna let it go away completely, so, and

1705
01:34:02,040 --> 01:34:06,360
despite every nice thing I said about PlayStation 3 earlier, I still think the PSP Go is a big

1706
01:34:06,360 --> 01:34:12,760
joke, and if you want to get a PSP, get a PSP 3000, and I would recommend a PSP 3000,

1707
01:34:12,760 --> 01:34:14,760
but I would not recommend a PSP Go.

1708
01:34:14,760 --> 01:34:19,120
All right, um, that's enough for Twitter topics, we talked a lot about those Twitter topics.

1709
01:34:19,120 --> 01:34:25,280
Let's move on with some rapid-fire news tonight on Orange Lawn's radio.

1710
01:34:25,280 --> 01:34:27,360
Loki, start us off with some quick news.

1711
01:34:27,360 --> 01:34:32,760
Well, I may not support the iPhone, they are getting a lot of games, and one game that

1712
01:34:32,760 --> 01:34:37,640
I like that's pretty awesome, Command & Conquer Red Alert will now be coming to the iPhone

1713
01:34:37,640 --> 01:34:44,520
this October, and will feature 12 levels in the game, and looks pretty awesome from the

1714
01:34:44,520 --> 01:34:48,800
screenshots, so, you know, hey, Red Alert's awesome, so definitely worth checking it out,

1715
01:34:48,800 --> 01:34:54,280
and, you know, with the touchscreen and everything, it should be perfect, since this is an RTS.

1716
01:34:54,280 --> 01:35:01,360
There is a fan movie released this week, actually kind of a mini Turbo, the movie, kind of showing

1717
01:35:01,360 --> 01:35:07,320
what a Street Fighter-esque type game would be played like in the future, and kind of

1718
01:35:07,320 --> 01:35:14,880
revolves around, you know, this player who's, you know, almost like a plot to, say, The

1719
01:35:14,880 --> 01:35:19,680
Wizard or something like that, you know, he's getting better at this one game in order to

1720
01:35:19,680 --> 01:35:26,520
fight somebody in this competition, and it's pretty neat because, I guess, his brother

1721
01:35:26,520 --> 01:35:31,920
in the movie or something was like a Tae Kwon Do master or something like that, and so now

1722
01:35:31,920 --> 01:35:36,880
he's getting trained from him to fight in this game and stuff, but the movie itself

1723
01:35:36,880 --> 01:35:43,600
is available online for free, or you can grab a DVD for it, and it actually, you know, it's

1724
01:35:43,600 --> 01:35:51,760
got a pretty decent story to it, and I think 20 minutes or so, so yeah, 23 minutes, so

1725
01:35:51,760 --> 01:35:56,160
definitely worth checking it out, and you can check it out at turbothemovie.com, so

1726
01:35:56,160 --> 01:35:57,880
that's pretty sweet.

1727
01:35:57,880 --> 01:36:05,480
Finally, there is a Resistance 3 billboard that's been spotted, and apparently this is

1728
01:36:05,480 --> 01:36:10,280
part of a background for a movie coming out called Battle of Los Angeles, which is due

1729
01:36:10,280 --> 01:36:14,840
out in 2011, although it's not really a big surprise that, you know, Resistance would

1730
01:36:14,840 --> 01:36:21,960
be, you know, Resistance 3 would be coming out eventually, but it's surprising, I guess,

1731
01:36:21,960 --> 01:36:26,360
to see a billboard for it, and apparently I do see something that was blacked out that

1732
01:36:26,360 --> 01:36:28,960
looks like a website, so interesting.

1733
01:36:28,960 --> 01:36:34,200
Alright, I got some rapid-fire news for you guys tonight, starting off with some Rockband

1734
01:36:34,200 --> 01:36:35,200
updates.

1735
01:36:35,200 --> 01:36:38,080
Here's some of the tracks coming to Rockband next week, October 13th, if you're on the

1736
01:36:38,080 --> 01:36:40,760
360 or the 15th, if you're on the PS3.

1737
01:36:40,760 --> 01:36:45,040
There's a Brutal Legend pack making its way out, coming with Motorhead, We Are The Road

1738
01:36:45,040 --> 01:36:49,840
Crew 08, Testament, More Than Meets The Eye, and of course Tenacious D with the metal,

1739
01:36:49,840 --> 01:36:52,880
since, you know, Jack Black is one of the voices in Brutal Legend.

1740
01:36:52,880 --> 01:36:58,240
Some other individual songs coming out for the bands Black Tide, Joe Satriani, Kansas,

1741
01:36:58,240 --> 01:37:01,520
L7, and Blink-182 with What's My Age Again.

1742
01:37:01,520 --> 01:37:03,800
That was one of the videos you would see on TV all the time.

1743
01:37:03,800 --> 01:37:06,260
So I bet L7's is Pretend That We're Dead.

1744
01:37:06,260 --> 01:37:07,260
That's already in the game.

1745
01:37:07,260 --> 01:37:10,080
And, well, then the other...

1746
01:37:10,080 --> 01:37:11,920
Andres is the song that's coming.

1747
01:37:11,920 --> 01:37:14,780
So there it is.

1748
01:37:14,780 --> 01:37:20,360
In other news, Jordan Mechner has filed a trademark for Prince of Persia, The Forgotten

1749
01:37:20,360 --> 01:37:21,360
Sands.

1750
01:37:21,360 --> 01:37:24,480
Of course, Jordan Mechner is the creator of the Prince of Persia series, after all.

1751
01:37:24,480 --> 01:37:30,040
So that may be something where, I don't know if that's something where the new Prince of

1752
01:37:30,040 --> 01:37:31,440
Persia series is headed.

1753
01:37:31,440 --> 01:37:33,320
That also might tie in with the movie, too.

1754
01:37:33,320 --> 01:37:36,840
That is very true, is that it could be a sequel to the movie that's coming out this year.

1755
01:37:36,840 --> 01:37:39,920
I think Sands of Time is what it's based on.

1756
01:37:39,920 --> 01:37:45,440
So it sounds like it could be a tie-in movie or maybe the next Prince of Persia game.

1757
01:37:45,440 --> 01:37:46,440
You never know.

1758
01:37:46,440 --> 01:37:50,840
But just so it's also stated, though, Mechner did once file a trademark called Prince of

1759
01:37:50,840 --> 01:37:56,060
Persia Prodigy that was never brought to light, at least as of yet.

1760
01:37:56,060 --> 01:37:58,680
So who knows if that will come to light at all.

1761
01:37:58,680 --> 01:38:02,160
And one more story for you real quick about the game Rocket Knight.

1762
01:38:02,160 --> 01:38:03,280
It's coming back.

1763
01:38:03,280 --> 01:38:09,680
Xbox Live, PlayStation Network, and Steam will be seeing this game in 2010.

1764
01:38:09,680 --> 01:38:13,640
This is coming from Konami, has made this game.

1765
01:38:13,640 --> 01:38:17,600
It's going to be on Xbox Live Arcade and all that good stuff in early 2010.

1766
01:38:17,600 --> 01:38:18,600
It is not a remake.

1767
01:38:18,600 --> 01:38:24,400
It is a sequel 15 years after the last Rocket Knight.

1768
01:38:24,400 --> 01:38:25,400
It looks pretty sweet, too.

1769
01:38:25,400 --> 01:38:27,200
Have you seen the screenshots or trailer yet?

1770
01:38:27,200 --> 01:38:30,320
I've just seen one screenshot, but I haven't seen the trailer.

1771
01:38:30,320 --> 01:38:31,320
It looks neat.

1772
01:38:31,320 --> 01:38:32,320
I don't know.

1773
01:38:32,320 --> 01:38:33,320
I never played the original.

1774
01:38:33,320 --> 01:38:34,320
Did you play it?

1775
01:38:34,320 --> 01:38:35,320
No.

1776
01:38:35,320 --> 01:38:37,600
Is this something Dark Sakura maybe played at all?

1777
01:38:37,600 --> 01:38:38,600
Rocket Knight?

1778
01:38:38,600 --> 01:38:39,600
No.

1779
01:38:39,600 --> 01:38:40,600
All right.

1780
01:38:40,600 --> 01:38:42,360
Well, Climax is developing the game.

1781
01:38:42,360 --> 01:38:45,160
They were the folks buying Silent Hill Origins.

1782
01:38:45,160 --> 01:38:46,840
So there you go.

1783
01:38:46,840 --> 01:38:48,480
Dark Sakura!

1784
01:38:48,480 --> 01:38:56,720
Well, for news of Halo 3 ODST, they actually made up...

1785
01:38:56,720 --> 01:38:59,800
Sorry, I'm getting dinged.

1786
01:38:59,800 --> 01:39:01,800
My apologies.

1787
01:39:01,800 --> 01:39:09,480
Actually are getting hit a 27 million game sold, which is pretty good.

1788
01:39:09,480 --> 01:39:13,920
So I'm sorry, that's total Halo game sold is up to 27 million.

1789
01:39:13,920 --> 01:39:21,960
Actually for ODST, 2.5 million copies have been sold within the last two weeks.

1790
01:39:21,960 --> 01:39:24,840
Also there's to be a little bit more for it.

1791
01:39:24,840 --> 01:39:30,880
That means that we're going to be potentially seeing Master Chief come out in one of the

1792
01:39:30,880 --> 01:39:33,580
future expansions.

1793
01:39:33,580 --> 01:39:39,200
And they also know that there were a few cliffhangers that need to be resolved.

1794
01:39:39,200 --> 01:39:44,660
But they're saying that they have a plan that's going out at least six years.

1795
01:39:44,660 --> 01:39:49,920
And it actually is going to tie in all the canon, including comic books and novels.

1796
01:39:49,920 --> 01:39:52,400
That sounds ambitious.

1797
01:39:52,400 --> 01:39:57,080
Also for Marvel Ultimate Alliance 2, they're getting Carnage.

1798
01:39:57,080 --> 01:40:04,280
And Carnage is, well, as everyone hopes, not just another Spider-Man and not just another

1799
01:40:04,280 --> 01:40:11,480
Venom but full on psycho, crazy, honorless, vicious, did I say crazy?

1800
01:40:11,480 --> 01:40:12,480
Because I mean crazy.

1801
01:40:12,480 --> 01:40:14,880
Carnage is fucking nuts.

1802
01:40:14,880 --> 01:40:15,880
So yeah.

1803
01:40:15,880 --> 01:40:17,240
Begetting Carnage.

1804
01:40:17,240 --> 01:40:18,680
Woot.

1805
01:40:18,680 --> 01:40:25,660
And then Activision filed a particular trademark for a particular adaptation of a particular

1806
01:40:25,660 --> 01:40:28,340
game to be made into a movie.

1807
01:40:28,340 --> 01:40:31,000
And that would be Call of Duty.

1808
01:40:31,000 --> 01:40:40,360
So I actually were, some of the people behind it were actually leaving hints about talking

1809
01:40:40,360 --> 01:40:43,360
with different directors already.

1810
01:40:43,360 --> 01:40:44,880
Cool.

1811
01:40:44,880 --> 01:40:49,120
All right.

1812
01:40:49,120 --> 01:40:50,960
That would be it for my quickie stuff.

1813
01:40:50,960 --> 01:40:54,280
That would be interesting for a Call of Duty movie, but I suppose it's inevitable because

1814
01:40:54,280 --> 01:40:55,280
the series is huge.

1815
01:40:55,280 --> 01:40:57,560
I think Call of Duty would make a great movie.

1816
01:40:57,560 --> 01:41:00,840
At least with Call of Duty, there is an actual storyline that goes along with it.

1817
01:41:00,840 --> 01:41:05,840
It's not like, you know, okay, let's make a war movie and call it Call of Duty.

1818
01:41:05,840 --> 01:41:07,120
I still wouldn't see it.

1819
01:41:07,120 --> 01:41:08,440
I'm not a big fan of war movies.

1820
01:41:08,440 --> 01:41:09,440
Exactly.

1821
01:41:09,440 --> 01:41:10,440
I like chick flicks.

1822
01:41:10,440 --> 01:41:11,440
All right.

1823
01:41:11,440 --> 01:41:12,440
Call of Duty, the chick flick?

1824
01:41:12,440 --> 01:41:16,080
No, they don't need to do Call of Duty, the chick flick.

1825
01:41:16,080 --> 01:41:17,080
That would be pretty funny.

1826
01:41:17,080 --> 01:41:21,540
You know, Final Fantasy is kind of a chick flick in some ways, especially emo ones like

1827
01:41:21,540 --> 01:41:22,860
Final Fantasy 7.

1828
01:41:22,860 --> 01:41:25,520
If they turn Final Fantasy 7 into a movie, that's kind of a chick flick.

1829
01:41:25,520 --> 01:41:26,520
A little bit.

1830
01:41:26,520 --> 01:41:32,520
They have, it's, you know, Advent Children wasn't so much a chick flick as it was just

1831
01:41:32,520 --> 01:41:33,520
confusing.

1832
01:41:33,520 --> 01:41:34,520
It was nonstop.

1833
01:41:34,520 --> 01:41:35,520
Action is what it was.

1834
01:41:35,520 --> 01:41:36,520
It doesn't need a plot.

1835
01:41:36,520 --> 01:41:37,520
It's just ass kickery.

1836
01:41:37,520 --> 01:41:38,520
In your face, ass kicking action.

1837
01:41:38,520 --> 01:41:39,520
Cloud is emo.

1838
01:41:39,520 --> 01:41:40,520
Vincent is dark.

1839
01:41:40,520 --> 01:41:41,520
Cloud is emo.

1840
01:41:41,520 --> 01:41:42,520
Vincent is dark.

1841
01:41:42,520 --> 01:41:43,520
Look.

1842
01:41:43,520 --> 01:41:44,520
Three sephiroths.

1843
01:41:44,520 --> 01:41:47,520
Three sephirbrats.

1844
01:41:47,520 --> 01:41:48,520
All right.

1845
01:41:48,520 --> 01:41:49,520
The end.

1846
01:41:49,520 --> 01:41:50,520
Exactly.

1847
01:41:50,520 --> 01:41:51,520
P.S.

1848
01:41:51,520 --> 01:41:52,520
Aerith is dead.

1849
01:41:52,520 --> 01:41:53,520
P.S.

1850
01:41:53,520 --> 01:41:54,520
Laura Klaw says I like the Twilight movies.

1851
01:41:54,520 --> 01:41:55,520
Wrong.

1852
01:41:55,520 --> 01:41:56,520
Ew.

1853
01:41:56,520 --> 01:41:57,520
Ew.

1854
01:41:57,520 --> 01:41:58,520
Ew.

1855
01:41:58,520 --> 01:41:59,520
Sparkly vampires for the lose.

1856
01:41:59,520 --> 01:42:00,520
No, no.

1857
01:42:00,520 --> 01:42:02,760
I'm not a fan of the Twilight movies.

1858
01:42:02,760 --> 01:42:03,760
I tried.

1859
01:42:03,760 --> 01:42:06,360
Did I tell you I sat down and tried to read the first book?

1860
01:42:06,360 --> 01:42:07,560
And I wanted to.

1861
01:42:07,560 --> 01:42:08,780
Did you notice it?

1862
01:42:08,780 --> 01:42:12,980
I'm glad it wasn't my book because it probably would have been the first book I ever burned.

1863
01:42:12,980 --> 01:42:17,240
I've never read the book, but my wife asks, and she's, you know, show me parts.

1864
01:42:17,240 --> 01:42:18,240
She's like, look at this.

1865
01:42:18,240 --> 01:42:20,920
It's like they don't have an editor for this book.

1866
01:42:20,920 --> 01:42:26,900
so many grammar and spelling and it just doesn't make any sense.

1867
01:42:26,900 --> 01:42:27,900
Back to video games.

1868
01:42:27,900 --> 01:42:28,900
Sorry.

1869
01:42:28,900 --> 01:42:30,940
Just proving how crappy it is.

1870
01:42:30,940 --> 01:42:33,560
Something not crappy though would be TrackMania.

1871
01:42:33,560 --> 01:42:40,760
And Ubisoft has acquired the developer of TrackMania, Nadeo, and apparently they're

1872
01:42:40,760 --> 01:42:44,240
doing it to build some online cred.

1873
01:42:44,240 --> 01:42:49,240
And I hope this means that we do get a console version of TrackMania 2 because it looks absolutely

1874
01:42:49,240 --> 01:42:50,240
awesome.

1875
01:42:50,240 --> 01:42:54,320
It's supposed to start racing with kind of the Forza 3 graphics, so hey, that's not a

1876
01:42:54,320 --> 01:42:56,400
bad combo whatsoever.

1877
01:42:56,400 --> 01:43:01,080
And they say, through Nadeo, Ubisoft will gain an expert team, one of the best online

1878
01:43:01,080 --> 01:43:06,240
technologies around, as well as a flagship multiplayer game that enjoys an unrivaled

1879
01:43:06,240 --> 01:43:10,880
reputation among the loyal and committed community.

1880
01:43:10,880 --> 01:43:14,400
And yeah, so awesome.

1881
01:43:14,400 --> 01:43:18,280
It doesn't look like they're going to be canceling any TrackMania games, and hopefully we'll

1882
01:43:18,280 --> 01:43:20,060
see this come to consoles.

1883
01:43:20,060 --> 01:43:24,120
That's what I'm really hoping for, because the DS version was awesome, but not as good

1884
01:43:24,120 --> 01:43:26,720
as a console release.

1885
01:43:26,720 --> 01:43:28,720
All right.

1886
01:43:28,720 --> 01:43:32,520
Well moving on to Facebook and Twitter on the Xbox 360.

1887
01:43:32,520 --> 01:43:34,800
This is something a lot of folks have been looking forward to.

1888
01:43:34,800 --> 01:43:39,520
Of course, Last.fm would be a part of this as well, but speaking specifically of Facebook

1889
01:43:39,520 --> 01:43:45,640
and Twitter, there was a splash page spotted on Xbox Live's UK portal saying that the service

1890
01:43:45,640 --> 01:43:48,100
is going to launch November 17th.

1891
01:43:48,100 --> 01:43:53,420
Now of course, again, this was on the UK portal, but if I'm not mistaken, don't you get these

1892
01:43:53,420 --> 01:43:54,960
updates worldwide?

1893
01:43:54,960 --> 01:43:56,920
So if they get on the 17th, we would too?

1894
01:43:56,920 --> 01:43:57,920
Pretty much, yeah.

1895
01:43:57,920 --> 01:43:58,920
It'd be relatively close.

1896
01:43:58,920 --> 01:43:59,920
Yeah.

1897
01:43:59,920 --> 01:44:01,240
So that's what they're saying.

1898
01:44:01,240 --> 01:44:05,040
This was spotted in a screenshot on the flash page, if you zoom in a lot there.

1899
01:44:05,040 --> 01:44:08,300
And it is just assumed, even though Last.fm isn't featured on there, that this update

1900
01:44:08,300 --> 01:44:11,420
is going to include that as well.

1901
01:44:11,420 --> 01:44:15,040
So there was a little firmware update that went out not that long ago, kind of prepping

1902
01:44:15,040 --> 01:44:17,360
the Xbox 360 for this.

1903
01:44:17,360 --> 01:44:20,720
So this is going to be on its way, and that's assumed in November.

1904
01:44:20,720 --> 01:44:24,120
I guess there's also going to be a beta test I was reading somewhere at the end of October

1905
01:44:24,120 --> 01:44:28,280
for these services, but I'm kind of eh on these.

1906
01:44:28,280 --> 01:44:32,000
I think the one cool thing would be maybe like taking screenshots and publishing them

1907
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:33,000
to Facebook.

1908
01:44:33,000 --> 01:44:34,000
That'd be cool.

1909
01:44:34,000 --> 01:44:38,600
But I don't see this being something I would want to use.

1910
01:44:38,600 --> 01:44:42,400
And what I really don't want to happen is I don't want it to turn into, with all due

1911
01:44:42,400 --> 01:44:44,720
respect to the people that made it, Raptor.

1912
01:44:44,720 --> 01:44:48,320
Like I don't want my Xbox 360 tweeting every time I put in a new game.

1913
01:44:48,320 --> 01:44:50,200
Because I know that's just going to irritate people.

1914
01:44:50,200 --> 01:44:53,980
And part of the reason I'm really starting to hate Twitter is that there's no filters.

1915
01:44:53,980 --> 01:44:56,680
Like Facebook is basically Twitter, but with filters.

1916
01:44:56,680 --> 01:45:00,120
But you can also use TweetDeck.

1917
01:45:00,120 --> 01:45:05,020
But even with TweetDeck, you can filter a certain person's tweets, which I do use.

1918
01:45:05,020 --> 01:45:07,040
But you can't filter the type.

1919
01:45:07,040 --> 01:45:10,520
If a person just posts annoying things over and over, I just unfollow them.

1920
01:45:10,520 --> 01:45:11,520
Exactly.

1921
01:45:11,520 --> 01:45:13,140
Like, I'm sorry, but it's just Twitter.

1922
01:45:13,140 --> 01:45:18,660
Like if you're going to get butthurt over me unfollowing you, get something real to

1923
01:45:18,660 --> 01:45:22,040
worry about, like Darfur or something.

1924
01:45:22,040 --> 01:45:23,040
I don't know.

1925
01:45:23,040 --> 01:45:25,840
But don't worry about me unfriending you on Twitter.

1926
01:45:25,840 --> 01:45:27,640
It just means you post a lot of crap.

1927
01:45:27,640 --> 01:45:33,080
So unfortunately, Twitter not having filters makes it really inferior to Facebook.

1928
01:45:33,080 --> 01:45:36,480
And hopefully there'll be a magic button where I can just block all the 360 updates from

1929
01:45:36,480 --> 01:45:38,260
Facebook if they're annoying.

1930
01:45:38,260 --> 01:45:40,840
But if they aren't, then maybe I'll keep it around.

1931
01:45:40,840 --> 01:45:41,960
We'll see.

1932
01:45:41,960 --> 01:45:45,440
So Last.fm on the other hand sounds very cool, because I'm already using Last.fm.

1933
01:45:45,440 --> 01:45:47,720
I have like 3,000 plays chalked up on there.

1934
01:45:47,720 --> 01:45:50,240
And God, some people have way more than that.

1935
01:45:50,240 --> 01:45:53,480
And I think Last.fm has a really good recommendation service.

1936
01:45:53,480 --> 01:45:55,040
I prefer it to Pandora.

1937
01:45:55,040 --> 01:45:58,040
I know a lot of people disagree with me and think Pandora is God.

1938
01:45:58,040 --> 01:46:01,280
But I like that Last.fm kind of bases its recommendations off of what you already play.

1939
01:46:01,280 --> 01:46:03,640
I use Last.fm at work sometimes.

1940
01:46:03,640 --> 01:46:05,680
Pandora is really useless to me.

1941
01:46:05,680 --> 01:46:06,880
Why is it blocked or something?

1942
01:46:06,880 --> 01:46:07,880
On my phone.

1943
01:46:07,880 --> 01:46:08,880
Oh.

1944
01:46:08,880 --> 01:46:09,880
They do have a Pandora app on the phone.

1945
01:46:09,880 --> 01:46:10,880
I know, but it's useless to me on my phone.

1946
01:46:10,880 --> 01:46:14,680
And I prefer using Last.fm, because if I want to listen to the stuff that I've been listening

1947
01:46:14,680 --> 01:46:18,400
to at home, then I may not have moved on to my iPhone then.

1948
01:46:18,400 --> 01:46:22,280
And of course, they have an Enflow station.

1949
01:46:22,280 --> 01:46:24,520
So I think Last.fm is pretty cool.

1950
01:46:24,520 --> 01:46:26,400
I'm excited to see how it works on Xbox.

1951
01:46:26,400 --> 01:46:28,240
I hope I can use it for background music.

1952
01:46:28,240 --> 01:46:29,240
We'll see.

1953
01:46:29,240 --> 01:46:33,680
But anyhow, that is all coming soon for Xbox Live Gold members getting a sneak peek.

1954
01:46:33,680 --> 01:46:38,660
But it sounds like everybody will get to access it on November 17th in the UK.

1955
01:46:38,660 --> 01:46:41,440
I'm sure the rest of us, hopefully, around the same time.

1956
01:46:41,440 --> 01:46:47,560
SHJ100Matt says in our chat room, chat.orangehonestrader.com, I really hope this doesn't open my gamertag

1957
01:46:47,560 --> 01:46:49,520
to the cam whores and porn spammers.

1958
01:46:49,520 --> 01:46:51,800
Oh, I hope so too.

1959
01:46:51,800 --> 01:46:56,900
But seeing as you have to follow them in order to see the messages on Twitter, hopefully,

1960
01:46:56,900 --> 01:46:59,020
you know.

1961
01:46:59,020 --> 01:47:03,400
And SalaciousPopInChat, I like this comment, LOL, it's not like LiveJournal where it's

1962
01:47:03,400 --> 01:47:06,140
a grievous offense to de-friend someone.

1963
01:47:06,140 --> 01:47:10,040
I totally agree because I totally get butthurt when people de-friend me on LiveJournal.

1964
01:47:10,040 --> 01:47:11,040
It's like, what did I do?

1965
01:47:11,040 --> 01:47:13,040
I'm doing it right now, Rob.

1966
01:47:13,040 --> 01:47:14,040
No, don't cry.

1967
01:47:14,040 --> 01:47:16,480
No, I do get butthurt when people un-friend me on LiveJournal.

1968
01:47:16,480 --> 01:47:19,000
But I put a lot more of myself out there on LiveJournal.

1969
01:47:19,000 --> 01:47:21,880
Twitter, I agree, is bullshit.

1970
01:47:21,880 --> 01:47:25,880
Facebook, I always kind of wonder why someone would de-friend me on Facebook because it's

1971
01:47:25,880 --> 01:47:26,880
just Facebook.

1972
01:47:26,880 --> 01:47:31,120
But LiveJournal, I actually kind of get butthurt because I have a friends-only journal.

1973
01:47:31,120 --> 01:47:34,700
And so if I let someone in to read it all and then they just leave, I'm kind of sad.

1974
01:47:34,700 --> 01:47:39,280
So I like to know why or, you know, I'm a big boy.

1975
01:47:39,280 --> 01:47:40,500
Tell me if you're unfollowing me.

1976
01:47:40,500 --> 01:47:45,480
You post too many, you know, memes or you post too many advertisements for your LiveJournal

1977
01:47:45,480 --> 01:47:46,480
games.

1978
01:47:46,480 --> 01:47:47,480
Please tell me.

1979
01:47:47,480 --> 01:47:50,240
Rob, I am so tired of that survivor thing.

1980
01:47:50,240 --> 01:47:53,320
Which by the way, I'm hosting season 18 and we're looking for players.

1981
01:47:53,320 --> 01:47:56,120
I think it's silly that there are 18 seasons.

1982
01:47:56,120 --> 01:47:58,960
I, well, there's 20 of the real things, so believe it.

1983
01:47:58,960 --> 01:47:59,960
All right, anyhow.

1984
01:47:59,960 --> 01:48:03,840
I'm sad that it caught up that fast.

1985
01:48:03,840 --> 01:48:06,640
It's just, it's no worse than role-play gaming online.

1986
01:48:06,640 --> 01:48:07,640
That's what it is.

1987
01:48:07,640 --> 01:48:08,640
It's role-play gaming.

1988
01:48:08,640 --> 01:48:10,880
All right, anyway.

1989
01:48:10,880 --> 01:48:14,280
Ray Ayanami in chat asked, what the hell is FarmVille or Mafia Wars?

1990
01:48:14,280 --> 01:48:16,540
Well, obviously he has- Boring crap!

1991
01:48:16,540 --> 01:48:20,920
I will say this though, Bejeweled Blitz got a makeover this week and it's awesome.

1992
01:48:20,920 --> 01:48:23,160
Oh yeah, my wife's been playing that non-stop.

1993
01:48:23,160 --> 01:48:24,440
It's awesome!

1994
01:48:24,440 --> 01:48:27,760
They totally revamped the game and made it more awesomer.

1995
01:48:27,760 --> 01:48:31,840
Well, Facebook finally did something right, speaking of their little games, that if I

1996
01:48:31,840 --> 01:48:36,960
don't give a shit about what game you're playing, and by the way, Loki, your wife just posted

1997
01:48:36,960 --> 01:48:37,960
weird pictures of herself.

1998
01:48:37,960 --> 01:48:40,960
Wait a minute, did she- Yes, she did.

1999
01:48:40,960 --> 01:48:41,960
Yes, yes.

2000
01:48:41,960 --> 01:48:47,920
She, she, I was trying to post my live journal post of my finishing the cabinet and she was

2001
01:48:47,920 --> 01:48:51,300
sitting next to me because I had my camera there that I had just taken pictures with,

2002
01:48:51,300 --> 01:48:55,560
taking weird pictures of herself and standing there and going, hey, look at this.

2003
01:48:55,560 --> 01:48:56,560
Hey, look at this.

2004
01:48:56,560 --> 01:48:57,560
Hey, look at this.

2005
01:48:57,560 --> 01:49:00,840
Then she started taking pictures of me too and it was annoying, so.

2006
01:49:00,840 --> 01:49:02,480
I'm like, knock it off.

2007
01:49:02,480 --> 01:49:07,640
Okay, what's more annoying, wife taking pictures of you or Farmville?

2008
01:49:07,640 --> 01:49:08,640
Farmville.

2009
01:49:08,640 --> 01:49:09,640
Farmville.

2010
01:49:09,640 --> 01:49:14,040
But actually, someone pointed out to me that you can hide those little app announcements

2011
01:49:14,040 --> 01:49:15,040
when people announce this shit.

2012
01:49:15,040 --> 01:49:16,040
Oh yeah, you didn't know that.

2013
01:49:16,040 --> 01:49:19,240
Well, I didn't think about it, but the ones that were getting me is when you have like

2014
01:49:19,240 --> 01:49:25,360
up in your little top hand corner, the so-and-so sent you a big pile of poopy from Sorority

2015
01:49:25,360 --> 01:49:26,360
Life.

2016
01:49:26,360 --> 01:49:27,360
Yes.

2017
01:49:27,360 --> 01:49:30,560
And I found, and the thing is, is that I've gone into my settings and blocked the application

2018
01:49:30,560 --> 01:49:31,840
and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

2019
01:49:31,840 --> 01:49:36,640
I have a real life, you know, and it still gives me those little invite things whenever

2020
01:49:36,640 --> 01:49:39,100
people send me the shit I don't care about.

2021
01:49:39,100 --> 01:49:44,580
So I found that you can go into the little thing there and then block the app from there.

2022
01:49:44,580 --> 01:49:48,600
I actually do think I did send you a big pile of poop in Sorority Life the other day.

2023
01:49:48,600 --> 01:49:50,200
So I'm surprised you're not using that too.

2024
01:49:50,200 --> 01:49:52,160
Speaking of which, oh, I was going to say.

2025
01:49:52,160 --> 01:49:54,800
I dropped that Sorority Life thing so fast.

2026
01:49:54,800 --> 01:49:56,040
I did too, finally.

2027
01:49:56,040 --> 01:49:57,040
I'm done with Sorority Life.

2028
01:49:57,040 --> 01:50:03,480
My wife is online, probably playing Bejeweled Blitz.

2029
01:50:03,480 --> 01:50:05,120
Good for her.

2030
01:50:05,120 --> 01:50:09,800
And not listening to this show, because it's just games, games, games.

2031
01:50:09,800 --> 01:50:10,800
Exactly.

2032
01:50:10,800 --> 01:50:14,480
All right, moving on with more news, Dark Sakura.

2033
01:50:14,480 --> 01:50:15,600
I don't want to.

2034
01:50:15,600 --> 01:50:16,600
You have to.

2035
01:50:16,600 --> 01:50:18,600
That's what we do here on the show.

2036
01:50:18,600 --> 01:50:19,600
Okay.

2037
01:50:19,600 --> 01:50:27,320
Apparently, Sony and Microsoft don't understand MMOs on a console.

2038
01:50:27,320 --> 01:50:33,920
This actually was said in an interview from one of the people behind Star Trek Online

2039
01:50:33,920 --> 01:50:40,000
that the reason the MMO is delayed is because of the business side of things.

2040
01:50:40,000 --> 01:50:41,560
He says the game runs.

2041
01:50:41,560 --> 01:50:42,840
The game is there.

2042
01:50:42,840 --> 01:50:45,720
It runs all of their games.

2043
01:50:45,720 --> 01:50:55,000
You know, like Champions Online, it runs almost, you know, pretty much all of their MMOs run

2044
01:50:55,000 --> 01:50:56,000
on the console.

2045
01:50:56,000 --> 01:51:01,880
It's just that they're trying to get Sony and Microsoft to understand how an MMO works

2046
01:51:01,880 --> 01:51:04,400
and what helps it make its money.

2047
01:51:04,400 --> 01:51:10,200
They said that the only ones to come close is maybe Final Fantasy XI and that they had

2048
01:51:10,200 --> 01:51:14,600
to make a lot of exceptions.

2049
01:51:14,600 --> 01:51:20,760
So Microsoft would, could establish a market share.

2050
01:51:20,760 --> 01:51:29,480
I just, I'm like, you know, if you haven't, if, if you are a newbie to the world of MMOs,

2051
01:51:29,480 --> 01:51:34,600
why don't you let the people who have done them before help you with your business model?

2052
01:51:34,600 --> 01:51:37,320
Hey, it's worked for this.

2053
01:51:37,320 --> 01:51:39,360
Why don't you do it this way?

2054
01:51:39,360 --> 01:51:44,480
It's just, to me, I don't really see any reason why it can't be run like it is on the

2055
01:51:44,480 --> 01:51:45,800
PC.

2056
01:51:45,800 --> 01:51:50,040
You know, you buy your game, you pay your subscription fee.

2057
01:51:50,040 --> 01:51:51,040
What's the big deal?

2058
01:51:51,040 --> 01:51:55,920
Well, you know, there have been some MMOs on consoles, but you know, they also, like

2059
01:51:55,920 --> 01:51:59,920
all the good ones I can think of were also on PC, like Final Fantasy XI, which might

2060
01:51:59,920 --> 01:52:00,920
be the only console MMO.

2061
01:52:00,920 --> 01:52:01,920
You said that's good?

2062
01:52:01,920 --> 01:52:03,360
Well, you know, for its time, yes.

2063
01:52:03,360 --> 01:52:06,240
Although Final Fantasy XIV, I'm all about that.

2064
01:52:06,240 --> 01:52:07,240
Yes siree.

2065
01:52:07,240 --> 01:52:11,120
I just still remember the day that you came over here to help me set up some of my stuff

2066
01:52:11,120 --> 01:52:17,720
on Final Fantasy XI, and I was doing everything on a controller, done all my macros and everything,

2067
01:52:17,720 --> 01:52:20,560
and you looked at me going, how the fuck are you doing that?

2068
01:52:20,560 --> 01:52:22,800
I couldn't play that game with a controller.

2069
01:52:22,800 --> 01:52:27,320
I realized it was made for the PS2, but I could not play that game with a controller.

2070
01:52:27,320 --> 01:52:28,320
Unpossible.

2071
01:52:28,320 --> 01:52:29,320
No, no.

2072
01:52:29,320 --> 01:52:30,320
I was playing on the PC.

2073
01:52:30,320 --> 01:52:31,320
I know.

2074
01:52:31,320 --> 01:52:32,320
I know you were.

2075
01:52:32,320 --> 01:52:33,320
I know you were.

2076
01:52:33,320 --> 01:52:34,320
Because I've been playing PSO.

2077
01:52:34,320 --> 01:52:35,320
And I thought you were a crackhead.

2078
01:52:35,320 --> 01:52:37,780
But hey, I made that shit work.

2079
01:52:37,780 --> 01:52:39,000
For the week you played, yes.

2080
01:52:39,000 --> 01:52:40,000
No.

2081
01:52:40,000 --> 01:52:41,320
That was when I was playing for a few months.

2082
01:52:41,320 --> 01:52:45,760
I remember once we were in a party in the Valcrum Dunes, and you were, heal please.

2083
01:52:45,760 --> 01:52:46,840
I was saying that to you.

2084
01:52:46,840 --> 01:52:47,840
Heal please.

2085
01:52:47,840 --> 01:52:49,840
And I was like, shut up please.

2086
01:52:49,840 --> 01:52:57,640
But it really wasn't until I got to World of Warcraft that I had to actually learn how

2087
01:52:57,640 --> 01:52:59,280
to play with a keyboard.

2088
01:52:59,280 --> 01:53:00,280
Which sucks.

2089
01:53:00,280 --> 01:53:02,520
I think MMOs are certainly possible on consoles.

2090
01:53:02,520 --> 01:53:05,920
Like a console exclusive MMO, and I kind of wish they'd go for it.

2091
01:53:05,920 --> 01:53:10,120
I think a game like Demon's Souls shows it's possible, even though that's not really an

2092
01:53:10,120 --> 01:53:11,120
MMO.

2093
01:53:11,120 --> 01:53:16,800
It is still a massively kind of multiplayer environment, it's just that the game doesn't

2094
01:53:16,800 --> 01:53:18,440
revolve around the multiplayer.

2095
01:53:18,440 --> 01:53:24,200
Well, I still, by the way, I'm gonna say to this day that I still wish that World of Warcraft

2096
01:53:24,200 --> 01:53:28,640
had controller support, and that I'm looking for two months of play, please.

2097
01:53:28,640 --> 01:53:30,800
Beg, beg, grovel, grovel.

2098
01:53:30,800 --> 01:53:33,120
Not really.

2099
01:53:33,120 --> 01:53:36,480
Then my paycheck situation fixes up.

2100
01:53:36,480 --> 01:53:38,440
I dinged level 45 paladin today.

2101
01:53:38,440 --> 01:53:39,440
Yay!

2102
01:53:39,440 --> 01:53:41,360
You know what level my character got to?

2103
01:53:41,360 --> 01:53:42,360
Seven.

2104
01:53:42,360 --> 01:53:43,360
Yes, exactly.

2105
01:53:43,360 --> 01:53:44,640
I know, you mentioned it two weeks ago.

2106
01:53:44,640 --> 01:53:45,640
I know.

2107
01:53:45,640 --> 01:53:47,640
And I haven't played in that long.

2108
01:53:47,640 --> 01:53:49,160
Alright, anyhow, Loki.

2109
01:53:49,160 --> 01:53:51,320
I haven't played any.

2110
01:53:51,320 --> 01:53:53,200
You've never played World of Warcraft, huh?

2111
01:53:53,200 --> 01:53:54,200
No.

2112
01:53:54,200 --> 01:53:57,960
You sunk like three years, well you suck for one, but you sunk like three years of

2113
01:53:57,960 --> 01:54:03,600
your life into Final Fantasy XI, and somehow never got sucked into World of Warcraft.

2114
01:54:03,600 --> 01:54:04,960
It's amazing to me.

2115
01:54:04,960 --> 01:54:07,800
This is what happens when Rob has a third a glass of wine.

2116
01:54:07,800 --> 01:54:08,800
Apparently.

2117
01:54:08,800 --> 01:54:10,400
Final Fantasy XIV, though, I...

2118
01:54:10,400 --> 01:54:13,280
Well, it won't be okay to drive home.

2119
01:54:13,280 --> 01:54:15,720
Final Fantasy XIV, though, I don't know.

2120
01:54:15,720 --> 01:54:16,720
I can't make any promises.

2121
01:54:16,720 --> 01:54:18,800
Final Fantasy XIV looks so sexy.

2122
01:54:18,800 --> 01:54:23,840
I'm like, no, you can't do this now!

2123
01:54:23,840 --> 01:54:26,400
I have a life, I've already moved on.

2124
01:54:26,400 --> 01:54:30,280
If anything's going to cause a divorce, it's going to be Final Fantasy XIV.

2125
01:54:30,280 --> 01:54:31,280
Alright.

2126
01:54:31,280 --> 01:54:32,280
Anyhow.

2127
01:54:32,280 --> 01:54:36,360
Alright, you better hope it has Bejeweled in it.

2128
01:54:36,360 --> 01:54:37,360
For your wife.

2129
01:54:37,360 --> 01:54:38,360
Well, hey, Bejeweled.

2130
01:54:38,360 --> 01:54:42,360
I showed her the Bejeweled Square Enix game, you remember that?

2131
01:54:42,360 --> 01:54:43,640
Oh, yeah.

2132
01:54:43,640 --> 01:54:45,560
But it's Bejeweled Twist, she doesn't like Bejeweled Twist.

2133
01:54:45,560 --> 01:54:48,360
She's like, ah, I know.

2134
01:54:48,360 --> 01:54:49,360
Whatever.

2135
01:54:49,360 --> 01:54:51,680
Um, so, Fifth Cell.

2136
01:54:51,680 --> 01:54:55,980
They're looking to move on to some other platforms other than the Wii and DS.

2137
01:54:55,980 --> 01:55:01,240
Their next game, which is pretty big, they say, and unannounced, will be for Xbox Live

2138
01:55:01,240 --> 01:55:02,520
Arcade.

2139
01:55:02,520 --> 01:55:06,000
And they go on saying, no, we're doing an Xbox Live Arcade title next, it's going to

2140
01:55:06,000 --> 01:55:07,000
be pretty big.

2141
01:55:07,000 --> 01:55:09,100
Wow, that's pretty generic.

2142
01:55:09,100 --> 01:55:13,160
It's going to be really cool, we're very excited about it, and it's totally not ready to be

2143
01:55:13,160 --> 01:55:14,160
announced.

2144
01:55:14,160 --> 01:55:15,480
It's far away.

2145
01:55:15,480 --> 01:55:18,440
I'm going to take a wild guess and say that it's probably going to look very similar to

2146
01:55:18,440 --> 01:55:26,160
Draw on the Life and Scribblenauts, since both their games are very similar looking.

2147
01:55:26,160 --> 01:55:29,200
I'm glad they're not doing the cheap Scribblenauts 2.

2148
01:55:29,200 --> 01:55:31,560
In fact, I hope they never make a sequel to Scribblenauts.

2149
01:55:31,560 --> 01:55:35,360
I would like to see more games that they just don't make sequels to.

2150
01:55:35,360 --> 01:55:40,520
I know that sounds cruel, but, you know, sometimes these series get dug into the ground, you

2151
01:55:40,520 --> 01:55:41,520
know?

2152
01:55:41,520 --> 01:55:42,520
Like the Guardian Legend.

2153
01:55:42,520 --> 01:55:43,520
No!

2154
01:55:43,520 --> 01:55:44,780
That must have a sequel.

2155
01:55:44,780 --> 01:55:48,560
That's one of those games where it's like, okay, 25 years later, we need a sequel to

2156
01:55:48,560 --> 01:55:49,560
that.

2157
01:55:49,560 --> 01:55:50,560
Or at least a remake.

2158
01:55:50,560 --> 01:55:51,560
I mean, come on.

2159
01:55:51,560 --> 01:55:52,560
A reimagining.

2160
01:55:52,560 --> 01:55:54,120
How about a reimagining?

2161
01:55:54,120 --> 01:55:57,680
I don't like the word remake as much as I do reimagining, because usually the reimagined

2162
01:55:57,680 --> 01:55:59,720
games are better, so.

2163
01:55:59,720 --> 01:56:03,200
Like the Silent Hill game on the Wii, which, that's out very soon, right?

2164
01:56:03,200 --> 01:56:04,200
On November.

2165
01:56:04,200 --> 01:56:06,200
Damn, they're going to miss Halloween?

2166
01:56:06,200 --> 01:56:07,200
Stupids?

2167
01:56:07,200 --> 01:56:09,200
Yeah, I got delayed.

2168
01:56:09,200 --> 01:56:10,380
Stupids?

2169
01:56:10,380 --> 01:56:12,120
Also stupid, in my opinion.

2170
01:56:12,120 --> 01:56:15,840
Rock Band is on its way to the iPhone, and I don't get it.

2171
01:56:15,840 --> 01:56:16,840
Like I do and I don't.

2172
01:56:16,840 --> 01:56:17,840
It's like the PSP version.

2173
01:56:17,840 --> 01:56:19,920
I under- well, no.

2174
01:56:19,920 --> 01:56:20,920
Bite your tongue.

2175
01:56:20,920 --> 01:56:23,660
The PSP version is amplitude or frequency.

2176
01:56:23,660 --> 01:56:24,960
It is awesome.

2177
01:56:24,960 --> 01:56:29,720
The iPhone version is just tap tap tap tap tap tap tap on your little screen.

2178
01:56:29,720 --> 01:56:35,000
It's like Tap Tap Revenge, which is funny for the first few songs you play, but then

2179
01:56:35,000 --> 01:56:36,280
kind of loses its point.

2180
01:56:36,280 --> 01:56:40,640
I like Tap Tap Revenge because there were some good songs in it that I could play.

2181
01:56:40,640 --> 01:56:41,640
That was it.

2182
01:56:41,640 --> 01:56:44,240
But like Rock Band on the iPhone, okay, look, here it is.

2183
01:56:44,240 --> 01:56:47,320
Before I give you my opinion, I should give you some of the facts.

2184
01:56:47,320 --> 01:56:49,400
There is going to be a four-way multiplayer mode.

2185
01:56:49,400 --> 01:56:54,000
It's all done over Bluetooth, and then you're going to have 20 games, which apparently are

2186
01:56:54,000 --> 01:56:55,640
all in the actual game.

2187
01:56:55,640 --> 01:56:59,160
And of course, since the iPhone will allow you to do microtransactions now, you can bet

2188
01:56:59,160 --> 01:57:03,320
there's going to be downloadable songs in the future that you will be able to buy these

2189
01:57:03,320 --> 01:57:06,120
song packs from EA Mobile.

2190
01:57:06,120 --> 01:57:11,320
So basically, this is just Rock Band on your phone, and you can play drums with your fingers.

2191
01:57:11,320 --> 01:57:14,680
And in my opinion, it's a little ridiculous, because you know what?

2192
01:57:14,680 --> 01:57:18,360
They're going to charge kind of, you know, a high price for this.

2193
01:57:18,360 --> 01:57:21,440
And there's some folks in chat that disagree with me.

2194
01:57:21,440 --> 01:57:22,440
Tap Tap is rads.

2195
01:57:22,440 --> 01:57:25,320
There's a couple people there, so.

2196
01:57:25,320 --> 01:57:26,320
You know what?

2197
01:57:26,320 --> 01:57:30,920
I probably won't ever get it because I'm still playing pickle.

2198
01:57:30,920 --> 01:57:31,920
You know what I find?

2199
01:57:31,920 --> 01:57:35,000
I've bought a lot of iPhone games that I just don't play.

2200
01:57:35,000 --> 01:57:38,520
And maybe it goes back to that whole handheld gaming thing that I don't really care for

2201
01:57:38,520 --> 01:57:39,680
handheld games usually.

2202
01:57:39,680 --> 01:57:41,880
I don't really play them a lot.

2203
01:57:41,880 --> 01:57:47,120
But I find that when I'm on my iPhone and I'm bored, I'm on Safari or Wikipedia or something.

2204
01:57:47,120 --> 01:57:49,820
I'm never on the games, hardly ever.

2205
01:57:49,820 --> 01:57:53,840
Here's what I have on mine, just for games left on here right now, is Peggle Cooking

2206
01:57:53,840 --> 01:57:58,720
Mama Vi, which was the Sega CD RPG.

2207
01:57:58,720 --> 01:58:06,440
I have the IMT Pain app.

2208
01:58:06,440 --> 01:58:07,440
Let me tell you what I have.

2209
01:58:07,440 --> 01:58:08,440
Click on Word of Day.

2210
01:58:08,440 --> 01:58:09,440
That's fun.

2211
01:58:09,440 --> 01:58:11,000
I have quite a few.

2212
01:58:11,000 --> 01:58:18,240
DDRS, Tap Tap Revenge 2, Word Fu, Labyrinth, Wild West, Silent Hill the Escape, Aurora

2213
01:58:18,240 --> 01:58:25,360
Faint the Arena, Pinball Dreams, Peggle, Columns Deluxe, Infinity Gene Space Invaders, Civilization

2214
01:58:25,360 --> 01:58:33,160
Revolution, and Luminous Light, which if you listen to the mini show from last week, is

2215
01:58:33,160 --> 01:58:35,340
the most horrible adaptation of Luminous.

2216
01:58:35,340 --> 01:58:37,320
It's an aberration of a Luminous game.

2217
01:58:37,320 --> 01:58:41,840
I've also had a Light Cycle game, remember, I had my Light Cycle game for a while, and

2218
01:58:41,840 --> 01:58:45,520
I did get Katamari, which I just didn't think was as much fun as I'd hoped it would have

2219
01:58:45,520 --> 01:58:46,520
been on the iPhone.

2220
01:58:46,520 --> 01:58:53,480
And I had Pole Position Remix, which was pretty fun, but mostly, you know, what I've been

2221
01:58:53,480 --> 01:58:54,480
playing on here.

2222
01:58:54,480 --> 01:58:56,120
I tried Pac-Man when I didn't think it was fun.

2223
01:58:56,120 --> 01:58:59,080
I just think the touch controls kind of suck.

2224
01:58:59,080 --> 01:59:00,080
Like I'm just kind of done with it.

2225
01:59:00,080 --> 01:59:01,080
Except for Peggle.

2226
01:59:01,080 --> 01:59:02,920
Yeah, they make it work for Peggle.

2227
01:59:02,920 --> 01:59:03,920
I will give you that.

2228
01:59:03,920 --> 01:59:07,400
It's actually a lot of fun to play Peggle on the iPhone.

2229
01:59:07,400 --> 01:59:08,720
That would be like the first game I would ever play.

2230
01:59:08,720 --> 01:59:10,600
Oh yeah, I have my Solid Tear game.

2231
01:59:10,600 --> 01:59:13,240
I had a good Sudoku game, too.

2232
01:59:13,240 --> 01:59:16,840
Well, anyhow, Rock Band's coming to the iPhone, and I don't care.

2233
01:59:16,840 --> 01:59:18,000
But maybe you do.

2234
01:59:18,000 --> 01:59:20,760
I'm sure there will be plenty of folks that download this, they're not gonna have a problem

2235
01:59:20,760 --> 01:59:24,800
selling this, but there you go.

2236
01:59:24,800 --> 01:59:30,000
Anyhow, let's get into the part of the show that is all about you guys, and the emails

2237
01:59:30,000 --> 01:59:34,720
that you send us every week to Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

2238
01:59:34,720 --> 01:59:36,720
It's our Orange Lounge Radio Mailbag segment.

2239
01:59:36,720 --> 01:59:38,840
I know, I'm excited, too.

2240
01:59:38,840 --> 01:59:43,200
Dark Soccer's gonna jump in head first in the email bag, and pull out some emails to

2241
01:59:43,200 --> 01:59:44,200
read.

2242
01:59:44,200 --> 01:59:48,040
I doubt it's very full this week, as we didn't have a show last week, really.

2243
01:59:48,040 --> 01:59:49,240
Well, we had a pre-taped show.

2244
01:59:49,240 --> 01:59:50,520
We had a number.

2245
01:59:50,520 --> 01:59:51,720
A tiny show.

2246
01:59:51,720 --> 01:59:55,120
Anyway, this comes from Slapshot, I'm gonna guess.

2247
01:59:55,120 --> 02:00:00,800
Hey guys, I know you probably won't read this on this show because of the content, but I

2248
02:00:00,800 --> 02:00:05,360
have a question about trying out, quote, Sims 3.

2249
02:00:05,360 --> 02:00:10,240
Everything has installed fine, and I'm using Magic Disc for my ISO.

2250
02:00:10,240 --> 02:00:11,240
I see.

2251
02:00:11,240 --> 02:00:13,240
Yeah, I'm gonna go ahead and do it online, I don't care.

2252
02:00:13,240 --> 02:00:17,440
After Sims 3 loads up, it gives me the error saying I don't have a disc in my drive.

2253
02:00:17,440 --> 02:00:18,440
Any suggestions?

2254
02:00:18,440 --> 02:00:21,600
Thanks a lot.

2255
02:00:21,600 --> 02:00:22,600
I have a suggestion.

2256
02:00:22,600 --> 02:00:23,600
Buy the game.

2257
02:00:23,600 --> 02:00:24,600
Buy the game.

2258
02:00:24,600 --> 02:00:25,600
That'll fix it.

2259
02:00:25,600 --> 02:00:29,480
Having a physical disc would probably be advisable.

2260
02:00:29,480 --> 02:00:35,200
I don't mean to give you shit, but when you decide to pirate games, getting low quality

2261
02:00:35,200 --> 02:00:39,440
and crap like this happening to you is exactly what you sign up for.

2262
02:00:39,440 --> 02:00:45,360
So like, if this were fmylife.com, I'd be clicking you deserved it right now.

2263
02:00:45,360 --> 02:00:49,520
So sorry I don't have any real advice for you, but you know what, here comes a point

2264
02:00:49,520 --> 02:00:54,720
where we have to say, enough piracy is enough, and do it just buy the game.

2265
02:00:54,720 --> 02:00:59,160
I'm sorry, I was actually suddenly looking at the back of the box.

2266
02:00:59,160 --> 02:01:04,360
Yeah, because my Sims 3 box is like sitting here on my desk because I keep the game in

2267
02:01:04,360 --> 02:01:08,280
my damn drive and take it out to burn DVDs, so.

2268
02:01:08,280 --> 02:01:10,840
Who else has seen the back of your box?

2269
02:01:10,840 --> 02:01:17,880
Look, oooh, Rob, it's my box, it's green.

2270
02:01:17,880 --> 02:01:20,720
Look, my box has a car.

2271
02:01:20,720 --> 02:01:23,720
I need to see a doctor.

2272
02:01:23,720 --> 02:01:24,720
Next email, quick.

2273
02:01:24,720 --> 02:01:26,720
Give me a doctor!

2274
02:01:26,720 --> 02:01:27,720
No, okay.

2275
02:01:27,720 --> 02:01:32,320
Um, this is from our buddy Rob-ba-ba.

2276
02:01:32,320 --> 02:01:36,320
Although this is not podcast material, I just wanted to share about my first trip to Disneyland.

2277
02:01:36,320 --> 02:01:38,200
Oh, it's podcast material.

2278
02:01:38,200 --> 02:01:40,000
I can see why you guys love it so much.

2279
02:01:40,000 --> 02:01:43,280
The Nightmare Before Christmas Haunted Mansion was amazing and worth a trip alone.

2280
02:01:43,280 --> 02:01:48,200
I also noticed that your Pirates of the Caribbean ride has the same basic components, but it

2281
02:01:48,200 --> 02:01:49,200
is just plain better.

2282
02:01:49,200 --> 02:01:52,600
Well, that's because we have two drops on ours.

2283
02:01:52,600 --> 02:01:57,000
You know, the one over in Florida has one drop.

2284
02:01:57,000 --> 02:02:01,880
Sorry, we just had a feed drop in our stage, so I was talking to the chatters.

2285
02:02:01,880 --> 02:02:02,880
What is this about?

2286
02:02:02,880 --> 02:02:03,880
I'm sorry.

2287
02:02:03,880 --> 02:02:04,880
Um, it's Disneyland.

2288
02:02:04,880 --> 02:02:05,880
Oh, yay!

2289
02:02:05,880 --> 02:02:06,880
Rob-ba-ba.

2290
02:02:06,880 --> 02:02:07,880
That's right, he went.

2291
02:02:07,880 --> 02:02:11,600
He went the one week I didn't go, because I went and then I stayed here a week and then

2292
02:02:11,600 --> 02:02:13,560
I went again, and he was there the week I was home.

2293
02:02:13,560 --> 02:02:17,920
Well, going forward, I love California Adventure too, so I looked it up on Google Maps and

2294
02:02:17,920 --> 02:02:22,400
saw something cool in the lagoon, which still had water in the picture.

2295
02:02:22,400 --> 02:02:27,000
There appears to be an earthquake happening based on the interference pattern on the surface.

2296
02:02:27,000 --> 02:02:31,280
A normal lagoon of that size would normally have small irregular waves, not evenly spaced

2297
02:02:31,280 --> 02:02:37,960
in consistent wave patterns, except that they, um, the lagoon water is filtered and runs

2298
02:02:37,960 --> 02:02:45,200
through cyclically, so, well, it did, when they had one, so, because I've actually got

2299
02:02:45,200 --> 02:02:52,040
to peek in the lagoon now that it's, um, dumped out and they're redoing shit, so, but yeah.

2300
02:02:52,040 --> 02:02:55,920
Actually I love looking at, just look at Disneyland over on Google Maps, that's pretty cool.

2301
02:02:55,920 --> 02:02:57,640
It's kind of fun to go on a virtual tour of Disneyland.

2302
02:02:57,640 --> 02:03:01,420
I love Google Maps just to go on virtual tours of just about anything, but I'm really glad

2303
02:03:01,420 --> 02:03:05,800
to hear Rob-ba-ba had fun at Disneyland, because it is a fun place.

2304
02:03:05,800 --> 02:03:09,520
I'm hoping to go one more time before my season pass expires.

2305
02:03:09,520 --> 02:03:13,720
And this is, now I keep forgetting if we said it was Shook, I think you said Shook.

2306
02:03:13,720 --> 02:03:14,720
I think it is Shook.

2307
02:03:14,720 --> 02:03:15,720
Okay.

2308
02:03:15,720 --> 02:03:16,720
Hello, OLR.

2309
02:03:16,720 --> 02:03:19,720
First off, I'd like to say that my fight with my father is over.

2310
02:03:19,720 --> 02:03:20,720
Yay!

2311
02:03:20,720 --> 02:03:23,760
Wait, I thought it was resolved in a previous episode of OLR.

2312
02:03:23,760 --> 02:03:24,760
Alright, whatever.

2313
02:03:24,760 --> 02:03:26,440
His dad took the game away, remember?

2314
02:03:26,440 --> 02:03:28,000
Yeah, but I thought they made up.

2315
02:03:28,000 --> 02:03:29,000
Alright, anyway.

2316
02:03:29,000 --> 02:03:32,240
I talked to him quoting you guys, I hope he didn't quote the kind of rude stuff that we

2317
02:03:32,240 --> 02:03:33,240
said, because, anyway.

2318
02:03:33,240 --> 02:03:36,240
But he seemed understanding for once.

2319
02:03:36,240 --> 02:03:40,240
He tried playing Final Fantasy X, and he actually seemed to love it, most notably the metal

2320
02:03:40,240 --> 02:03:41,240
music.

2321
02:03:41,240 --> 02:03:42,320
Now, on to the main story.

2322
02:03:42,320 --> 02:03:47,440
I was in gym class playing American football when an idiot in my class fouls the ball.

2323
02:03:47,440 --> 02:03:51,400
He runs over to the ball and starts teabagging the ball.

2324
02:03:51,400 --> 02:03:53,920
Let that sink in.

2325
02:03:53,920 --> 02:03:56,440
I swear to God we read this email the week you weren't here.

2326
02:03:56,440 --> 02:03:57,440
Did you?

2327
02:03:57,440 --> 02:04:00,280
But I'm looking at the date that email was received, and it was Friday, I wonder if dude

2328
02:04:00,280 --> 02:04:01,280
sent the email twice.

2329
02:04:01,280 --> 02:04:03,920
Oh, well, if you already read it, then.

2330
02:04:03,920 --> 02:04:04,920
Go ahead and finish.

2331
02:04:04,920 --> 02:04:06,160
Is it about the lewd sexual behavior?

2332
02:04:06,160 --> 02:04:07,160
Yeah, you weren't here.

2333
02:04:07,160 --> 02:04:08,160
Go ahead.

2334
02:04:08,160 --> 02:04:09,160
You can put your opinion on it.

2335
02:04:09,160 --> 02:04:11,120
No, no, if you already read it, then.

2336
02:04:11,120 --> 02:04:12,120
I could be wrong.

2337
02:04:12,120 --> 02:04:13,120
I don't know.

2338
02:04:13,120 --> 02:04:14,920
Chatters, does this email sound familiar?

2339
02:04:14,920 --> 02:04:19,360
That's why I said I could swear we had a resolution on the, um, but maybe he re-sent it, because

2340
02:04:19,360 --> 02:04:22,280
the podcast feed hasn't gotten updated in a while, so maybe he didn't hear it.

2341
02:04:22,280 --> 02:04:25,620
Alright, well, the coach grabs him by the neck, drags him inside, screaming, you little

2342
02:04:25,620 --> 02:04:27,300
son of a bitch.

2343
02:04:27,300 --> 02:04:33,240
If idiot was suspended for lewd sexual behavior, it just goes to show how far gaming has taken

2344
02:04:33,240 --> 02:04:34,720
us in society.

2345
02:04:34,720 --> 02:04:39,840
Is it true- it truly is the shit like this that gives us good gamers a bad stereotyped

2346
02:04:39,840 --> 02:04:41,240
name.

2347
02:04:41,240 --> 02:04:45,400
Was it re- what really pisses me the hell off slash rant.

2348
02:04:45,400 --> 02:04:46,400
You're truly shook.

2349
02:04:46,400 --> 02:04:51,360
Uh, PS, a few weeks ago, Juan ranted about old people not wearing bras.

2350
02:04:51,360 --> 02:04:52,360
He was right.

2351
02:04:52,360 --> 02:04:57,920
A little bag of an English teacher let out a knit- a knit slip in front of everyone.

2352
02:04:57,920 --> 02:04:58,920
Gag.

2353
02:04:58,920 --> 02:04:59,920
Ew!

2354
02:04:59,920 --> 02:05:03,240
You've got a fucked up school, dude.

2355
02:05:03,240 --> 02:05:06,360
Your English teachers are showing their ta-tas and your gym teachers are throwing people

2356
02:05:06,360 --> 02:05:09,220
against the wall, calling them sons of bitches, like, seriously?

2357
02:05:09,220 --> 02:05:10,220
Go to private school?

2358
02:05:10,220 --> 02:05:18,140
Well, first of all, the behavior was- Tell your dad we said that, too.

2359
02:05:18,140 --> 02:05:25,080
The behavior of the, uh, idiot playing football was indeed unnecessary and deserved punishment,

2360
02:05:25,080 --> 02:05:27,320
but- Has nothing to do with games.

2361
02:05:27,320 --> 02:05:29,180
Yeah, that has nothing to do with games.

2362
02:05:29,180 --> 02:05:36,120
The coach, however, seriously, uh, needed to, uh, also be suspended at least for a game

2363
02:05:36,120 --> 02:05:41,760
or have, uh, you know, some sort of probationary measure taken.

2364
02:05:41,760 --> 02:05:45,480
And then, um, your English teacher does need to wear a better bra.

2365
02:05:45,480 --> 02:05:51,240
This sounds like the high school in Glee, like, only, like, random shit happens.

2366
02:05:51,240 --> 02:05:54,560
What- You've got an interesting life- None of that ever happened at- at mine except

2367
02:05:54,560 --> 02:06:02,760
for one teacher accidentally, um, ripping his, um, pants in, um, I always tell his underwear

2368
02:06:02,760 --> 02:06:03,760
but still.

2369
02:06:03,760 --> 02:06:08,660
Shook, I hope you're writing all this down so that you can write an epic autobiography

2370
02:06:08,660 --> 02:06:09,660
someday.

2371
02:06:09,660 --> 02:06:11,080
A memoir, if you will.

2372
02:06:11,080 --> 02:06:14,240
Dude, sell it to a reality show or something.

2373
02:06:14,240 --> 02:06:16,240
Of course, you know I won't watch it.

2374
02:06:16,240 --> 02:06:17,240
Um.

2375
02:06:17,240 --> 02:06:18,720
You're so kind.

2376
02:06:18,720 --> 02:06:21,920
I don't watch, like, a reality show, sorry, you know.

2377
02:06:21,920 --> 02:06:25,040
Um, okay, this next one comes from, uh, SonicM88.

2378
02:06:25,040 --> 02:06:26,600
Hello, O.L.R.!

2379
02:06:26,600 --> 02:06:27,600
Hi.

2380
02:06:27,600 --> 02:06:28,600
Bling, bling.

2381
02:06:28,600 --> 02:06:33,280
I was just responding.

2382
02:06:33,280 --> 02:06:35,320
I miss you guys a ton.

2383
02:06:35,320 --> 02:06:38,880
I haven't- Wow, a ton, that's two thousand pounds.

2384
02:06:38,880 --> 02:06:43,200
I haven't been able to listen to you guys for ever- several months for complicated reasons

2385
02:06:43,200 --> 02:06:45,960
but I needed to let you guys know something.

2386
02:06:45,960 --> 02:06:49,900
Rob, I remember way back in an old podcast you used to talk about how much you loved

2387
02:06:49,900 --> 02:06:51,960
Alanis Morissette in Rock Band 2.

2388
02:06:51,960 --> 02:06:56,240
Well, as I'm sure you know, two additional Alanis Morissette songs came as downloadable

2389
02:06:56,240 --> 02:06:57,240
content.

2390
02:06:57,240 --> 02:06:58,240
What?

2391
02:06:58,240 --> 02:06:59,240
Really?

2392
02:06:59,240 --> 02:07:04,200
I was probably just as stoked as you were to hear that they were coming out-

2393
02:07:04,200 --> 02:07:05,200
You lie!

2394
02:07:05,200 --> 02:07:09,880
So I bought them as soon as I could and for you I decided to get first place on both of

2395
02:07:09,880 --> 02:07:11,840
them, Ironic and Head Over Feet, on vocals.

2396
02:07:11,840 --> 02:07:15,960
Wait a minute, wait a minute, hold on, Loki, Alanis' tracks came out on Rock Band?

2397
02:07:15,960 --> 02:07:17,960
I miss this.

2398
02:07:17,960 --> 02:07:18,960
There may have been some.

2399
02:07:18,960 --> 02:07:21,040
You know what, we didn't cover Rock Band releases last week because we didn't have

2400
02:07:21,040 --> 02:07:22,040
a show.

2401
02:07:22,040 --> 02:07:23,040
Yeah.

2402
02:07:23,040 --> 02:07:24,040
Maybe it did happen.

2403
02:07:24,040 --> 02:07:25,040
Chatters?

2404
02:07:25,040 --> 02:07:26,040
Did I really miss that?

2405
02:07:26,040 --> 02:07:27,040
Can I continue?

2406
02:07:27,040 --> 02:07:28,040
Yeah.

2407
02:07:28,040 --> 02:07:29,040
Figure is the one week that you don't do it.

2408
02:07:29,040 --> 02:07:30,040
I know, right?

2409
02:07:30,040 --> 02:07:38,760
As of this posting I'm still first on Xbox 360 leaderboards, gamertag LucasPones8907.

2410
02:07:38,760 --> 02:07:43,080
He sends a follow up email though.

2411
02:07:43,080 --> 02:07:46,840
It seems someone's taken my first place on Head Over Feet but I'm working hard for first

2412
02:07:46,840 --> 02:07:48,080
again for you, Rob.

2413
02:07:48,080 --> 02:07:52,400
I'm still first on Ironic though but maybe I shouldn't say that or I'll jinx my score

2414
02:07:52,400 --> 02:07:53,400
again.

2415
02:07:53,400 --> 02:07:55,960
Dude, I'll play expert with you or something and we'll take over the leaderboards.

2416
02:07:55,960 --> 02:07:59,760
I did not know that was- now I gotta get my Xbox 360 back.

2417
02:07:59,760 --> 02:08:03,160
There you go, you asked earlier what it would take to get my 360 back.

2418
02:08:03,160 --> 02:08:05,120
What's gonna light the fire under Rob's ass?

2419
02:08:05,120 --> 02:08:06,320
Alanis and Rock Band, there you go.

2420
02:08:06,320 --> 02:08:09,680
Hey, you know what lit the fire under your ass for PS3?

2421
02:08:09,680 --> 02:08:10,680
Abba!

2422
02:08:10,680 --> 02:08:15,640
Oh yeah, SingStar Abba, yeah, that was a big seller too.

2423
02:08:15,640 --> 02:08:16,640
Which I still play.

2424
02:08:16,640 --> 02:08:20,800
You need to play some Beatles Rock Band with me.

2425
02:08:20,800 --> 02:08:22,680
I did pretty damn good, okay?

2426
02:08:22,680 --> 02:08:25,640
I blame you now for me playing Beatles Rock Band.

2427
02:08:25,640 --> 02:08:26,640
So there is-

2428
02:08:26,640 --> 02:08:27,720
Getting me up there making me sing.

2429
02:08:27,720 --> 02:08:31,760
There is much more to the cast of Orange Lounge Radio than just video games and I will say,

2430
02:08:31,760 --> 02:08:38,720
I am not ashamed to admit I'm a huge Alanis Morissette fan and that was my musical muse

2431
02:08:38,720 --> 02:08:41,000
in high school, like for real.

2432
02:08:41,000 --> 02:08:47,180
Did you actually watch the video that I posted on Facebook a while back which was the metaphor

2433
02:08:47,180 --> 02:08:51,160
free radio thing from College Humor?

2434
02:08:51,160 --> 02:08:52,640
Was that the-

2435
02:08:52,640 --> 02:08:53,640
The guy sitting in the car?

2436
02:08:53,640 --> 02:08:54,640
Turn around?

2437
02:08:54,640 --> 02:08:55,640
No, I didn't see that one.

2438
02:08:55,640 --> 02:08:56,640
No.

2439
02:08:56,640 --> 02:08:58,040
I saw the total eclipse of the heart little video.

2440
02:08:58,040 --> 02:09:02,680
It was basically a guy listening to his radio says, and now on Sublight Radio we have metaphor

2441
02:09:02,680 --> 02:09:07,640
free radio and then it was all these songs doing like literally what the songs mean and

2442
02:09:07,640 --> 02:09:14,720
the Alanis part was, I hate you Dave Coulier.

2443
02:09:14,720 --> 02:09:18,120
Shut the front door, Tiger Claw just linked me to rockband.com.

2444
02:09:18,120 --> 02:09:22,160
Sure enough, this happened on October 2nd, this would have been the week we weren't here.

2445
02:09:22,160 --> 02:09:23,160
This was last week.

2446
02:09:23,160 --> 02:09:27,920
That's just what goes to show if we miss a session.

2447
02:09:27,920 --> 02:09:30,800
Electric Six and Flowbots.

2448
02:09:30,800 --> 02:09:33,600
Oh my God, Gaybar by Electric Six is in rockband.

2449
02:09:33,600 --> 02:09:34,600
That song is awesome.

2450
02:09:34,600 --> 02:09:35,600
Sweet.

2451
02:09:35,600 --> 02:09:39,340
You, I want to take you to a gaybar.

2452
02:09:39,340 --> 02:09:40,340
That song is rad.

2453
02:09:40,340 --> 02:09:42,440
Dude, we missed an awesome week.

2454
02:09:42,440 --> 02:09:45,120
Do you have that on your computer, Rob?

2455
02:09:45,120 --> 02:09:53,140
I do, but iTunes will slow things down significantly, however, this is why we have such wonderful

2456
02:09:53,140 --> 02:09:57,000
things like YouTube so that when you're in the middle of a radio show, you can actually

2457
02:09:57,000 --> 02:10:04,000
just pull it up and you can actually get the song.

2458
02:10:04,000 --> 02:10:30,240
Why is War censored on YouTube?

2459
02:10:30,240 --> 02:10:36,040
Is that because it's Abraham Lincoln wearing no pants and you can't say more?

2460
02:10:36,040 --> 02:10:47,840
On a spin bike at that.

2461
02:10:47,840 --> 02:10:51,440
Tell me you do not want to play this in rockband right the fuck now.

2462
02:10:51,440 --> 02:10:52,440
Seriously.

2463
02:10:52,440 --> 02:11:04,200
After the show, YouTube that immediately, it's hilarity.

2464
02:11:04,200 --> 02:11:05,200
It really is.

2465
02:11:05,200 --> 02:11:07,880
That song is awesome.

2466
02:11:07,880 --> 02:11:13,200
Anyhow, thank you, emailer, for alerting us to such awesomeness in rockband that we missed

2467
02:11:13,200 --> 02:11:14,200
the week of...

2468
02:11:14,200 --> 02:11:15,200
Ironically enough...

2469
02:11:15,200 --> 02:11:17,480
Rob is throwing up the horns, but he's doing it wrong.

2470
02:11:17,480 --> 02:11:21,360
Ironically enough, the week of gay days at Disneyland.

2471
02:11:21,360 --> 02:11:26,520
Rob is throwing up the horns the wrong way, because really, that's too much metal for

2472
02:11:26,520 --> 02:11:29,240
one hand.

2473
02:11:29,240 --> 02:11:30,640
Too much metal at the gay bar.

2474
02:11:30,640 --> 02:11:36,240
All right, anyhow, let's move on to the FUs of the week, which I sadly don't really have

2475
02:11:36,240 --> 02:11:39,640
a story to inspire tonight.

2476
02:11:39,640 --> 02:11:42,120
So we're just going to get into the FUs of the week.

2477
02:11:42,120 --> 02:11:46,180
I thought there was something in our show about a lawsuit, but I guess maybe it was

2478
02:11:46,180 --> 02:11:49,200
something I cut out accidentally, whatever.

2479
02:11:49,200 --> 02:11:50,600
It's one of those nights tonight.

2480
02:11:50,600 --> 02:11:55,960
I've been drinking wine, and now I have gay bar on repeat in my head, and now Loki's singing

2481
02:11:55,960 --> 02:11:57,960
it over there.

2482
02:11:57,960 --> 02:11:58,960
I just said one line.

2483
02:11:58,960 --> 02:11:59,960
All right, anyhow.

2484
02:11:59,960 --> 02:12:00,960
Here come the FUs of the week.

2485
02:12:00,960 --> 02:12:01,960
A chance for a little angst in your life.

2486
02:12:01,960 --> 02:12:02,960
Oh, this is bad.

2487
02:12:02,960 --> 02:12:03,960
Here is justice.

2488
02:12:03,960 --> 02:12:04,960
Here is punishment.

2489
02:12:04,960 --> 02:12:05,960
Here...

2490
02:12:05,960 --> 02:12:06,960
This is fucked up.

2491
02:12:06,960 --> 02:12:29,320
Um, FU to EDD and other disability things for the lovely gap in my paycheck, which has

2492
02:12:29,320 --> 02:12:34,840
not been fun because, you know, I like to have money with which to pay my bills.

2493
02:12:34,840 --> 02:12:42,840
I really like being able to pay my bills because, you know, it means that I can eat and have

2494
02:12:42,840 --> 02:12:47,880
a place to live without, you know, feeling completely guilty for, you know, taking advantage

2495
02:12:47,880 --> 02:12:54,040
of my friend's generosity, and, you know, and there's also this, you know, wonderful

2496
02:12:54,040 --> 02:12:58,160
concept, Rob, of power and internet.

2497
02:12:58,160 --> 02:12:59,160
I love them.

2498
02:12:59,160 --> 02:13:01,160
Love them both.

2499
02:13:01,160 --> 02:13:05,840
I would seriously go without eating before I didn't pay the internet bill.

2500
02:13:05,840 --> 02:13:10,440
Honestly, I realize my priorities are fucked, but...

2501
02:13:10,440 --> 02:13:11,440
I'll put it this way.

2502
02:13:11,440 --> 02:13:18,460
I found food in my fridge that I didn't even know existed, and then once we got a little

2503
02:13:18,460 --> 02:13:26,720
bit of a break thanks to me getting some massage work in, thanks to having a very good generous

2504
02:13:26,720 --> 02:13:32,400
friend and, uh, thanks to a little bit of a break on our rent, so we actually were able

2505
02:13:32,400 --> 02:13:34,400
to go get groceries and get some of our bills paid.

2506
02:13:34,400 --> 02:13:35,920
I might take you out for a massage, by the way.

2507
02:13:35,920 --> 02:13:37,920
I can use one if you're still giving them out.

2508
02:13:37,920 --> 02:13:38,920
Fifty bucks?

2509
02:13:38,920 --> 02:13:39,920
I might actually go for it.

2510
02:13:39,920 --> 02:13:40,920
For an hour?

2511
02:13:40,920 --> 02:13:41,920
For an hour.

2512
02:13:41,920 --> 02:13:42,920
Hmm.

2513
02:13:42,920 --> 02:13:43,920
I might do it.

2514
02:13:43,920 --> 02:13:44,920
I might have friends that are interested too if you really want.

2515
02:13:44,920 --> 02:13:47,920
As long as they won't report me for not having my business license.

2516
02:13:47,920 --> 02:13:48,920
Oh.

2517
02:13:48,920 --> 02:13:53,320
Well, I don't know about that, but, you know, I can't do T.A. there.

2518
02:13:53,320 --> 02:13:54,320
No.

2519
02:13:54,320 --> 02:13:55,320
Rob.

2520
02:13:55,320 --> 02:13:56,320
Rob.

2521
02:13:56,320 --> 02:13:57,320
Rob.

2522
02:13:57,320 --> 02:13:58,320
Yeah, but I'll charge for that.

2523
02:13:58,320 --> 02:13:59,320
Wink.

2524
02:13:59,320 --> 02:14:00,320
Wink.

2525
02:14:00,320 --> 02:14:01,320
Okay.

2526
02:14:01,320 --> 02:14:02,320
Wink.

2527
02:14:02,320 --> 02:14:03,320
Wink.

2528
02:14:03,320 --> 02:14:04,320
Wink.

2529
02:14:04,320 --> 02:14:05,320
Wink.

2530
02:14:05,320 --> 02:14:06,320
Wink.

2531
02:14:06,320 --> 02:14:07,320
IGH.

2532
02:14:07,320 --> 02:14:11,320
// Humane

2533
02:14:11,320 --> 02:14:12,120
F.e. to the guy.

2534
02:14:12,120 --> 02:14:13,320
It's actually kind of my fault.

2535
02:14:13,320 --> 02:14:19,300
F.e. to me, answering the door to my house because every time I do, it's always somebody

2536
02:14:19,300 --> 02:14:24,340
is trying to sell me something and, for some reason, I end up getting roped into buying

2537
02:14:24,340 --> 02:14:25,340
something.

2538
02:14:25,340 --> 02:14:27,940
It was actually a guy coming up to quote us for a new roof

2539
02:14:27,940 --> 02:14:30,340
Which is fine cuz we needed that and I wanted to quote for a new roof

2540
02:14:30,420 --> 02:14:33,820
But he sat there and talked to us for two hours, and that was just unacceptable

2541
02:14:33,820 --> 02:14:36,500
I just wanted him to give me a damn price because I knew it was gonna be expensive anyways

2542
02:14:36,780 --> 02:14:40,540
But he sat there and talked about how his roofing system is the most

2543
02:14:40,940 --> 02:14:46,180
Awesome thing in the world, and I really don't give a crap because I was in the middle of soldering for my new cabinet

2544
02:14:47,140 --> 02:14:49,140
And you don't interrupt that

2545
02:14:49,140 --> 02:14:53,900
Um f you to something I didn't bring up earlier in the show

2546
02:14:54,100 --> 02:14:58,980
But f you to the fact that my world of warcraft account got hacked this week while I was on vacation

2547
02:14:58,980 --> 02:15:03,780
I got a call Monday morning for my buddy Shane who said that all my characters were logging in and out of Ravencrest

2548
02:15:03,780 --> 02:15:07,540
And I said boy, that's really funny because I'm not playing the game right now in fact

2549
02:15:07,540 --> 02:15:11,340
I'm in Los Angeles turns out my password was stolen and my account was hacked

2550
02:15:12,140 --> 02:15:18,820
Which makes me feel very vulnerable because if they have my wow password what else do they have now granted?

2551
02:15:18,820 --> 02:15:22,540
I removed an authenticator from my account which yes, you might think is stupid

2552
02:15:22,540 --> 02:15:27,420
But the keychain broke so I was gonna lose that authenticator if I didn't remove my account

2553
02:15:27,420 --> 02:15:32,100
So they could've stolen my password from my ex-boyfriend's computer, or maybe his was insecure

2554
02:15:32,100 --> 02:15:32,660
I don't know

2555
02:15:32,660 --> 02:15:36,100
But all I know is that it makes me very nervous to know that I have passwords stolen

2556
02:15:36,100 --> 02:15:42,580
So I had to go change all of my passwords and everything to Blizzard's credit very nice customer service even though

2557
02:15:42,580 --> 02:15:47,220
It took me forever to get through like they had a 30-minute hold time Monday morning

2558
02:15:47,220 --> 02:15:51,260
And I even called like right before close, and I still had to wait 18 minutes before I got a representative

2559
02:15:51,260 --> 02:15:56,460
But to be fair she was very nice did everything she was supposed to do I trained customer service for call centers

2560
02:15:56,460 --> 02:15:57,660
I'm always very

2561
02:15:57,660 --> 02:16:02,860
Scrutinizing those people she was a very good rep and I got an email from a lady that was very nice at Blizzard too

2562
02:16:02,980 --> 02:16:04,700
The GM's fixed my stuff

2563
02:16:04,700 --> 02:16:10,300
It's probably the whole thing took about three to four days, but fuck you to people who steal passwords, and I've decided

2564
02:16:10,820 --> 02:16:13,740
I'm completely against people buying gold and wow at this point

2565
02:16:13,740 --> 02:16:20,460
You know why because you only encourage these assholes to do what they do so if you buy wow and or if you buy gold and

2566
02:16:20,460 --> 02:16:22,460
Wow fuck you

2567
02:16:24,620 --> 02:16:26,220
There you go

2568
02:16:26,220 --> 02:16:32,040
X link in chat says wow rape damn. Yes. I feel like I was raped in the face by a

2569
02:16:32,820 --> 02:16:37,420
Warcraft hacker Lumi's in chat says Rob. I had to wait an hour and a half on Friday morning

2570
02:16:37,420 --> 02:16:40,220
I should get everything restored in two to four days well sadly

2571
02:16:40,220 --> 02:16:44,500
I guess it wasn't just I mean I'm glad to hear it wasn't just me, but at the same time that really sucks

2572
02:16:44,900 --> 02:16:48,020
Yeah, it takes a couple days to get everything restored see now the good news was I

2573
02:16:48,580 --> 02:16:50,020
Wasn't really playing on that server

2574
02:16:50,020 --> 02:16:51,380
I was playing on a different server

2575
02:16:51,380 --> 02:16:56,620
But right around the same time my wow account got hacked and I got home was when I was really getting into demon souls

2576
02:16:56,620 --> 02:16:58,900
so I wasn't really missing Wow anyway, but

2577
02:16:59,420 --> 02:17:01,420
It still sucks

2578
02:17:01,740 --> 02:17:03,380
bar

2579
02:17:03,380 --> 02:17:05,380
by the way

2580
02:17:05,460 --> 02:17:09,620
The story I was going to read to lead into the F use tonight for some reason I forgot to link it

2581
02:17:09,620 --> 02:17:11,620
There was a dude that got

2582
02:17:12,100 --> 02:17:16,380
Banned from the Sony PlayStation Network, and he was gonna file a lawsuit

2583
02:17:16,380 --> 02:17:19,420
Or he did file a lawsuit saying that his first amendment rights were breached

2584
02:17:20,020 --> 02:17:25,180
Well, and what's wrong with this picture? Can your first amendment rights really be breached when you're banned from the PlayStation Network?

2585
02:17:26,060 --> 02:17:29,060
No, cuz bright PlayStation Network is a private network

2586
02:17:29,060 --> 02:17:32,500
And that's exactly what a judge Ronald M

2587
02:17:32,500 --> 02:17:39,500
White said in a federal court in the Northern District of California earlier this week is that there was no plausible first of amendment cause and

2588
02:17:39,860 --> 02:17:45,460
Throughout the lawsuit but interesting from some of the commenters here on Kotaku where I saw this story

2589
02:17:45,460 --> 02:17:50,540
I thought a really good point that was brought up by one of the commenters is that but when you buy stuff on PlayStation Network

2590
02:17:50,620 --> 02:17:52,900
It's tied to your login name

2591
02:17:52,900 --> 02:17:58,660
So if you suddenly get banned from Wow, not only do you use your act lose your access you lose everything you bought

2592
02:17:58,660 --> 02:18:03,780
That is kind of messed up in a way. Although granted. I mean if you did something really bad

2593
02:18:03,780 --> 02:18:09,820
Maybe you had it coming. It's also in the terms of service and you have to read that but that is that shady

2594
02:18:09,820 --> 02:18:11,820
That's a little shady throw all this money

2595
02:18:13,100 --> 02:18:18,660
It's an incentive for him not to be a douchebag now what is kind of messed up and yeah

2596
02:18:18,660 --> 02:18:25,340
You may not understand you realize it like for example the PlayStation Network forums, you know where it's tied to your account

2597
02:18:25,340 --> 02:18:30,860
you get banned from the forums you get banned from PlayStation Network, which is kind of shady because you know

2598
02:18:30,860 --> 02:18:35,900
You may not realize that but once again read your terms of service Wow and don't be a douchebag

2599
02:18:36,140 --> 02:18:39,300
Yeah, I mean I agree with don't be a douchebag and maybe he had it coming in a way

2600
02:18:39,300 --> 02:18:43,100
But at the same time like what if a mistake happens because you know, like I you know

2601
02:18:43,100 --> 02:18:44,860
I'm comparing apples to oranges here

2602
02:18:44,860 --> 02:18:46,960
But on the Xbox side of things if you get banned

2603
02:18:46,960 --> 02:18:49,580
There's no way to contest it which I think it's kind of fucked up

2604
02:18:49,580 --> 02:18:53,480
Like I think there should be a way you can contest it especially if it's like not you

2605
02:18:53,480 --> 02:18:58,820
I mean you are responsible for your account that it added up but after getting hacked in Wow and

2606
02:18:59,180 --> 02:19:04,860
Seriously, I'm not an idiot on the computer. Okay, like I know what sites I'm logging into

2607
02:19:05,220 --> 02:19:07,740
I'm not you know, I'd like to think I'm not an idiot

2608
02:19:07,740 --> 02:19:12,900
so I'm kind of shocked that this happened to me and that was really alarming because I

2609
02:19:13,640 --> 02:19:18,740
Don't do stupid things on my computer. Like I don't download programs and run them. You know what I mean?

2610
02:19:18,740 --> 02:19:25,100
Like it's kind of scary. So I heard it might have been an exploit in flash that got me but still

2611
02:19:25,940 --> 02:19:27,580
terrible

2612
02:19:27,580 --> 02:19:31,540
Terrible terrible. All right, just a couple more stories for you guys and then your calls Loki

2613
02:19:32,260 --> 02:19:36,540
yes, so EA has trademarked a new game called the Ripper and

2614
02:19:37,300 --> 02:19:41,740
what it's believed to be is actually a game based on Jack the Ripper and

2615
02:19:42,900 --> 02:19:44,900
apparently I

2616
02:19:44,900 --> 02:19:52,340
I guess this is a kinder gentler Jack the Ripper and not really he's killing people friendship friendship

2617
02:19:52,620 --> 02:19:59,180
He's still killing people. But these people aren't really people. They're demons. So he's killing demons and

2618
02:19:59,820 --> 02:20:05,300
Want to say I saw a law and order or no, not law and order. This is very similar to uh, god damn it

2619
02:20:05,300 --> 02:20:07,300
there is a a

2620
02:20:07,500 --> 02:20:09,500
Movie that was out there. I

2621
02:20:09,500 --> 02:20:10,940
I

2622
02:20:10,940 --> 02:20:16,420
Can't remember it now. Anyways, this is similar to movie, you know where you're killing demons with its people and stuff like that

2623
02:20:16,900 --> 02:20:21,820
So yeah, think of like I guess a dead space game where you're Jack the Ripper ripping people apart

2624
02:20:21,820 --> 02:20:24,300
But they're really demons so you shouldn't feel so bad about it

2625
02:20:26,220 --> 02:20:28,220
Praise Jack the Ripper

2626
02:20:28,780 --> 02:20:32,220
Interesting, I guess and it's believed that this is

2627
02:20:33,660 --> 02:20:36,280
Visceral's games new action title

2628
02:20:36,280 --> 02:20:38,280
All

2629
02:20:39,240 --> 02:20:41,000
Right, I

2630
02:20:41,000 --> 02:20:44,880
Guess I'll have to wait to see this game in motion there. It could be interesting

2631
02:20:44,880 --> 02:20:47,200
I mean, I like the survival horror type games

2632
02:20:47,200 --> 02:20:50,600
Although I have yet to check out saw but I'm kind of on the fence like, you know

2633
02:20:50,600 --> 02:20:51,920
I'm not gonna get into it again

2634
02:20:51,920 --> 02:20:54,280
But you know how I feel about the saw movies and that is I hate them

2635
02:20:54,440 --> 02:20:58,680
But I am kind of curious about the game because the game's demo looked interesting at e3

2636
02:20:58,680 --> 02:21:01,360
I'm surprised you haven't played it Loki seem like type of thing. You would have got all the time

2637
02:21:01,360 --> 02:21:06,040
I'm playing DJ hero. Gotcha. All right. Anyhow, one more story for you guys

2638
02:21:06,040 --> 02:21:08,660
Then we're gonna open up the skype line at one eight seven seven game

2639
02:21:08,800 --> 02:21:12,780
Olr or our username on skype orange lounge radio hoping to hear from some new people tonight

2640
02:21:13,280 --> 02:21:15,980
Because now we have some new people listening. So one eight seven seven game

2641
02:21:15,980 --> 02:21:21,600
Olr username on skype is orange launch radio. We have one more story for you guys involving one of my favorite games

2642
02:21:21,600 --> 02:21:26,080
In fact, probably my favorite game ever on the Commodore 64 at least I can think of right now

2643
02:21:26,080 --> 02:21:32,000
Our con remember our con it was like battle chess but cooler because it wasn't actually chess

2644
02:21:32,000 --> 02:21:35,720
But it was dark versus light and you were trying to take over these power squares

2645
02:21:35,760 --> 02:21:40,680
but when you would when two pieces would come together like the shape-shifter and the Phoenix or the

2646
02:21:41,080 --> 02:21:46,280
Banshee and the Valkyrie they would do battle in this arena and you would have basically have to kill one other piece

2647
02:21:46,360 --> 02:21:51,240
So it wasn't like chess where whoever was the attacker was always the victor two pieces would fight

2648
02:21:51,240 --> 02:21:54,200
Well, the game came on the iPhone not that long ago

2649
02:21:54,200 --> 02:21:57,640
There was a version of it released for iPhone, which I forgot about that might be a game

2650
02:21:57,640 --> 02:22:00,780
I need to pick up even though I just talked about how I don't play games on iPhone, but I love our con

2651
02:22:01,380 --> 02:22:08,300
Well, apparently the game was so successful. Guess what our con is coming back to the PC. That's right

2652
02:22:08,820 --> 02:22:15,500
Information coming from Chad Lee the owner and developer of react games in bringing our con back to the PC

2653
02:22:15,500 --> 02:22:18,960
We've really focused on maintaining the classic feel of the original game

2654
02:22:19,040 --> 02:22:22,600
That said there were aspects of the title that needed updating for the modern audience

2655
02:22:22,600 --> 02:22:27,280
For example, the addition of four players was never in the original but it adds so much fun

2656
02:22:27,280 --> 02:22:32,960
It feels like it always belonged there. So yes, there are achievements and HD resolution online support

2657
02:22:33,000 --> 02:22:38,200
It's all gonna be there and apparently there's gonna be a new our con based iPhone game as well

2658
02:22:38,640 --> 02:22:45,760
It's gonna be a single-player experience with four campaigns at 60 quests unique enemies and characters

2659
02:22:46,160 --> 02:22:48,560
It's all gonna use ng moko's plus

2660
02:22:48,560 --> 02:22:52,600
technology awards and a leaderboard and all that fun stuff

2661
02:22:53,200 --> 02:22:59,920
our con conquest submitted to the App Store earlier this month should be out any time now and the first our con game just you

2662
02:22:59,920 --> 02:23:03,400
Know was a remake of the first game. So that's very exciting

2663
02:23:03,960 --> 02:23:09,020
Because I love our con. I'm a little iffy on this whole like four player modernized thing, but you know what?

2664
02:23:09,020 --> 02:23:12,760
I'll still try it out. So hopefully it's cool kind of a bummer

2665
02:23:12,760 --> 02:23:16,360
There's no console release, but at least hey anybody can put anything out on PC, right?

2666
02:23:16,360 --> 02:23:17,600
anybody

2667
02:23:17,600 --> 02:23:22,200
Anybody else a fan of our con just me just me. Okay. All right. I like battle chess

2668
02:23:22,720 --> 02:23:29,720
Yeah, I never played the game. Did you ever play battle chess to know there was battle chess to Chinese chess

2669
02:23:29,720 --> 02:23:34,600
And it was a totally I mean because obviously it was based off a Chinese chess totally different

2670
02:23:34,640 --> 02:23:39,640
But I actually did play that when I was a kid tried to learn how to play Chinese chess. It's hard. It's not

2671
02:23:40,200 --> 02:23:43,680
Chinese checkers Chinese chess totally different. Anyhow

2672
02:23:43,680 --> 02:23:48,040
One eight seven seven game. Ol our username on skype is orange lounge radio

2676
02:23:58,840 --> 02:24:02,060

Hit our line when you guys hear it Loki any last-minute stories

2678
02:24:07,800 --> 02:24:10,520
Yeah, the odd world games are coming to the PlayStation Network and

2679
02:24:10,520 --> 02:24:13,800
Apparently tells that were exclusive before

2680
02:24:14,600 --> 02:24:20,200
Also now coming to the PC. They have a new pack that they're basically release them under I guess the

2681
02:24:20,960 --> 02:24:22,960
What was it the?

2682
02:24:23,840 --> 02:24:25,840
Original no

2683
02:24:26,200 --> 02:24:30,220
The odd box that's what it was including looks like a

2684
02:24:32,040 --> 02:24:34,040
Stranger's wrath

2685
02:24:34,360 --> 02:24:36,360
Munches Odyssey and

2686
02:24:36,360 --> 02:24:43,200
The original odd world game so that's kind of cool. Um, that's it. Let me get to the phones. We have a call

2687
02:24:43,200 --> 02:24:45,200
Hi, you're on orange launch radio

2688
02:24:46,180 --> 02:24:51,880
Hello, you're oh my gosh Skype crashed on me that sucks that was not the caller's fault that was Skype's fault

2689
02:24:51,880 --> 02:24:58,560
It just crashed that's like a bad Skype naughty naughty and I apologize to the caller that was on the line waiting to talk to us

2690
02:24:58,880 --> 02:25:05,120
But computer crashes, I guess are inevitable. Thank God Adobe Edition didn't crash or we lose all part B of our show

2691
02:25:05,120 --> 02:25:07,120
Wouldn't that be lovely do over?

2692
02:25:08,160 --> 02:25:10,720
I'm gonna call that person back because they did get through

2693
02:25:11,960 --> 02:25:13,200
mm-hmm

2694
02:25:13,200 --> 02:25:16,160
This is a nice thing when you call through Skype. I know who it is. Hi

2695
02:25:17,560 --> 02:25:21,200
You're on orange on this radio. Who's this? Hey, this is excellent. Hi X link

2696
02:25:21,200 --> 02:25:24,880
I don't know if you heard if the buffer made it through for some reason Skype crashed. So we called you back

2697
02:25:26,240 --> 02:25:29,560
Appreciate no, I was on there and I saw that I was like wow, that's kind of interesting

2698
02:25:29,560 --> 02:25:32,960
I thought was my end because I'm having problems with my laptop right now with my

2699
02:25:32,960 --> 02:25:37,900
Um mouse pad part with the click instead of clicking once you like to like like five different times

2700
02:25:38,520 --> 02:25:42,360
Just sucks. Although I am thinking about using it on my PSP. I have a PSP headset

2701
02:25:42,360 --> 02:25:44,360
I can use Skype on it, but I'm like who would call me

2702
02:25:44,800 --> 02:25:46,040
like

2703
02:25:46,040 --> 02:25:50,960
Nobody calls my iPhone. Why would people call me on Skype? I don't know. Anyway, sorry, that would be kind of interesting

2704
02:25:51,800 --> 02:25:54,640
Few things I'm gonna make this make this quick course

2705
02:25:54,640 --> 02:26:00,200
I'm gonna go through a few things here really quickly the PSP mini prices are actually pretty

2706
02:26:00,200 --> 02:26:05,320
Decent the only one that's really the highest point as of right now would be the Tetris game

2707
02:26:07,040 --> 02:26:08,500
Sudoku is

2708
02:26:08,500 --> 02:26:14,560
$6.99 and there's a two other ones for $4.99 and I believe two or three other ones for $6.99

2709
02:26:14,560 --> 02:26:16,560
So, I mean they're all under ten bucks

2710
02:26:17,400 --> 02:26:23,880
Level in Sudoku though is zero. I mean I'm done with Sudoku you Sudoku can be played with paper in pen, but yeah

2711
02:26:23,880 --> 02:26:25,880
I totally agree. I guess

2712
02:26:25,880 --> 02:26:31,160
It's just EA though and you know EA is gonna be a little more expensive because you know the EA brand name being on it

2713
02:26:31,160 --> 02:26:33,160
So, oh well hell of course

2714
02:26:34,840 --> 02:26:38,360
As for the Kingdom Hearts I played a new one I've been playing a new one for DS

2715
02:26:38,360 --> 02:26:43,120
I'm not gonna give anything away storyline wise but I'm gonna say I know you're a big fan of it

2716
02:26:43,120 --> 02:26:46,060
Play it when you get a chance or you know buy it. It's

2717
02:26:46,760 --> 02:26:53,360
Worth wild. It's been a lot of fun. I've been playing about ten hours and I've been pretty much addicted to it. So

2718
02:26:53,360 --> 02:26:56,120
And there is a lot of different characters in it

2719
02:26:56,120 --> 02:26:59,120
Okay, as long as they didn't cut out the Disney then I'm happy. How about Tron?

2720
02:26:59,120 --> 02:27:03,840
You can spoil that for me is Tron in it. I believe I don't know be it quite honest

2721
02:27:03,840 --> 02:27:07,920
I only played ten hours. I'm not really in I'm only on the second third world

2722
02:27:07,920 --> 02:27:13,200
I was gonna say it was ten hours enough to get past the prologue like Kingdom Hearts 2. Oh, definitely

2723
02:27:13,200 --> 02:27:17,240
You know, there's a lot of talk in the beginning and there's a lot of the beginning where they're saying

2724
02:27:17,240 --> 02:27:21,160
Okay, this button is this this does this if you press this button it does this

2725
02:27:21,160 --> 02:27:27,540
This is how you do stuff in the game. But once you get past all of it, it pretty much becomes normal. Hmm

2726
02:27:27,800 --> 02:27:30,000
All right. Well, I'll have to check that out

2727
02:27:30,000 --> 02:27:36,280
I suppose house look is it does it play like the PlayStation Kingdom Heart games or is it that it plays like that PS?

2728
02:27:36,280 --> 02:27:41,880
Yes, the ps1 the Kingdom Hearts and Kingdom Hearts 2 it doesn't play like that good. It's not like the chain of memory

2729
02:27:41,880 --> 02:27:43,880
Thank God good

2730
02:27:44,120 --> 02:27:46,120
So I'm waiting for birth by sleep

2731
02:27:46,120 --> 02:27:52,260
For the PSP now, so hopefully that will work well as well too. So well the way it's the on that one

2732
02:27:52,840 --> 02:27:57,480
Very cool. I'll tell you if you want a headache try playing a chain of memories on a micro

2733
02:27:58,680 --> 02:28:06,040
Thank you. No, thank you pass on that one. I did I do have the original though for the Gameboy advance

2734
02:28:06,760 --> 02:28:12,640
But yeah, no, I I tried playing that was the last one I tried to play on any handheld. I

2735
02:28:12,640 --> 02:28:18,120
I can only imagine what a headache machine that was anything else in your mind tonight excellent

2736
02:28:18,120 --> 02:28:19,200
Well, it was kind of funny

2737
02:28:19,200 --> 02:28:23,760
You robbed the whole hacking issue wasn't they having a problem with the Xbox Live and the hacking on that one, too?

2738
02:28:23,760 --> 02:28:28,840
People are trying to get some people were trying it to people's accounts to that one that had high game scores

2739
02:28:28,840 --> 02:28:32,320
Yeah, it was it was retarded stuff. It was like some kid

2740
02:28:33,080 --> 02:28:38,200
Sending voice messages to people saying I can give you cheats or whatever if you send me your account information

2741
02:28:38,200 --> 02:28:42,760
So like, you know, it you'd have to be an idiot to fall for that. Yeah, I

2742
02:28:44,080 --> 02:28:50,120
Live at least that I know of yet. I mean, I've been out of Xbox Live for about two months now, so

2743
02:28:51,880 --> 02:28:55,480
I've been on longer than that. So I've been busy doing my school stuff

2744
02:28:55,480 --> 02:29:00,560
So I can yeah, you can understand that but they're trying to probably sound like someone they were pulling back in the you know

2745
02:29:00,560 --> 02:29:06,400
Hey days of hey, give me I'm so I'm surprised or not. I'm so-and-so from Xbox Live. I need your name and password

2746
02:29:06,400 --> 02:29:08,680
There's been a system server crash that type of deal

2747
02:29:09,240 --> 02:29:13,640
Well, I hope everyone knows by now. Nobody will ask you for your name and password online a

2748
02:29:14,280 --> 02:29:21,200
Nobody that just doesn't happen not through email not online. It doesn't happen. Even when you call support they don't ask for it

2749
02:29:21,200 --> 02:29:23,620
They have ways of verifying you in other ways. So

2750
02:29:24,320 --> 02:29:29,520
Like I know with Blizzard, I guess I filled out a security question about like for example

2751
02:29:29,920 --> 02:29:31,620
This wasn't my security question

2752
02:29:31,620 --> 02:29:34,320
But like an example would be what was your house number as a child?

2753
02:29:34,320 --> 02:29:37,020
You know things that only you would know that a hacker wouldn't know

2754
02:29:37,480 --> 02:29:43,220
Yeah, so well anything else in your mind tonight? Excellent. Yeah, that's pretty much about it. All right, even so

2755
02:29:43,220 --> 02:29:47,000
I heard that's one the hardest ones yet from Atlas and I'm hearing they're getting good reviews from it

2756
02:29:47,000 --> 02:29:48,120
So you have a lot of fun with that

2757
02:29:48,120 --> 02:29:49,200
I just you know

2758
02:29:49,200 --> 02:29:53,680
Although I can see from a critical standpoint where it's getting good reviews and I'm not knocking the game at all

2759
02:29:53,680 --> 02:30:00,000
But the difficulty is really gonna turn some people off. So proceed carefully. Oh, I agree, but hey Atlas

2760
02:30:00,600 --> 02:30:02,200
RPGs you can't really beat that

2761
02:30:02,200 --> 02:30:07,080
I mean the every pretty much everything they have sealed with their name on there has been pretty much gold

2762
02:30:07,080 --> 02:30:11,940
So, all right fair enough. They do make good stuff. All right, take care. Excellent. Yeah YouTube. Thanks for the call

2763
02:30:12,720 --> 02:30:15,760
We got comments in chat here. What is this?

2764
02:30:17,040 --> 02:30:23,320
Kill Gannon one three three seven says I wonder if Rob's Wow pass was secure like caps numbers and shit

2765
02:30:23,320 --> 02:30:27,040
Um, I didn't use caps, but my password

2766
02:30:27,040 --> 02:30:33,320
To somebody who wouldn't know better would look like an a random jumble of letters

2767
02:30:33,320 --> 02:30:37,860
They meant something to me, but for most people just look like a random jumble of letters and numbers

2768
02:30:37,860 --> 02:30:41,220
I did use both letters and numbers so I don't think by any means it was easy to guess

2769
02:30:41,520 --> 02:30:44,400
Like it wasn't like a pet name. It wasn't

2770
02:30:45,400 --> 02:30:50,580
You know anything like that. So let's go to another call. Hi. You're on orange launch radio. Who's this?

2771
02:30:50,580 --> 02:30:55,540
Hello, you're on orange launch radio, who's this?

2772
02:30:58,020 --> 02:31:00,520
Hola bienvenidos all orange lounge radio kenis

2773
02:31:02,040 --> 02:31:07,980
Okay, yes, the person isn't there remember you can always call echo one two three before you give us a call to make sure

2774
02:31:07,980 --> 02:31:11,740
Your setup works. That's always a good idea. So there you go

2775
02:31:11,740 --> 02:31:21,820
A one eight seven seven game olr or username on skype orange lounge radio

2776
02:31:21,820 --> 02:31:26,780
If you want to give us a call was that it for last minute story tonight Loki G rent is pretty much it I think

2777
02:31:29,340 --> 02:31:31,780
Hold on we had another call. Hi, you're on orange launch radio. Who's this?

2778
02:31:31,780 --> 02:31:40,540
Hi, how are you? Oh pretty good. How are you? No good. It wouldn't be a skype segment without you. What's on your mind?

2779
02:31:42,140 --> 02:31:46,620
Two quick tips, I don't want to take up too much time because you're near the end of your show

2780
02:31:47,620 --> 02:31:51,500
I guess, you know one tip of information regarding

2781
02:31:52,180 --> 02:31:54,180
PS the PSN store

2782
02:31:54,180 --> 02:32:01,900
We released from I think was last week. Yeah, and now also at the same time. I also want to put some moment about

2783
02:32:02,700 --> 02:32:04,700
PlayStation 3 as well

2784
02:32:05,260 --> 02:32:07,260
There was one release

2785
02:32:07,860 --> 02:32:14,380
On the PSN store. It's a PS1 classic. Yeah, I think you guys me and like it was

2786
02:32:15,100 --> 02:32:21,780
Pandemonium which was poured out by I think crystal dynamics. Yes. I I've never played the game, but I

2787
02:32:21,780 --> 02:32:26,060
I've heard I actually have the Japanese version of it, which was

2788
02:32:27,740 --> 02:32:29,740
Magical hoppers. Oh

2789
02:32:30,540 --> 02:32:33,260
Yeah, I used to hit the desk version

2790
02:32:33,860 --> 02:32:38,820
Fortunately, I had that stolen a couple years ago. So I just bought the download version

2791
02:32:39,700 --> 02:32:46,100
And it's pretty good. The graphics are kind of dated by today's standards, but all in all it's pretty good

2792
02:32:46,100 --> 02:32:52,380
You know, I mean as far as my complaint isn't so much with the system itself

2793
02:32:52,380 --> 02:32:57,940
It's just fun, but it doesn't yeah too pretty of some of the other users on it

2794
02:32:58,660 --> 02:33:05,780
You know how well with the messaging on there, you know, they get the whole cut-and-paste kind of deal on there

2795
02:33:06,420 --> 02:33:09,940
Well, I yeah, well, I don't know if you've seen this yet or not

2796
02:33:09,940 --> 02:33:12,460
You know, if not, you probably will see it soon

2797
02:33:12,460 --> 02:33:18,720
But you know people have been doing it on piece checking messages. No, no

2798
02:33:20,020 --> 02:33:22,980
Oh, yeah, it's like, you know

2799
02:33:23,260 --> 02:33:30,140
if if you you're send this message to X number people so he's gonna see this and

2800
02:33:30,940 --> 02:33:37,260
And they're gonna track this message and you know, they'll really key low on the PlayStation 3

2801
02:33:37,260 --> 02:33:42,580
My god that ridiculous I'm like, you know, really that's why I'm thinking a

2802
02:33:43,380 --> 02:33:45,820
You know, he low and gears and all they are

2803
02:33:46,500 --> 02:33:51,540
Microsoft exclusive now, they're gonna notice nopes calm just for PlayStation Network

2804
02:33:51,540 --> 02:33:56,140
It sounds like they're just gonna need something to try to diffuse all the rumors there, you know

2805
02:33:56,140 --> 02:33:58,740
I'm surprised and I hope I'm not starting something here

2806
02:33:58,740 --> 02:34:03,060
I'm surprised I don't get that crap on my iPhone ever since they did the copy paste thing on iPhone, too

2807
02:34:03,060 --> 02:34:09,980
But I suppose whenever you open this up to you know, having the copy paste you wouldn't even really need it

2808
02:34:09,980 --> 02:34:13,420
I suppose it just makes it a lot easier to send these chain messages and crap

2809
02:34:13,420 --> 02:34:20,420
But just you know think before you forward good rule of thumb for everybody out there think before you forward

2810
02:34:20,500 --> 02:34:24,900
Do you really think Sony cares about what you're writing in messages to other people?

2811
02:34:25,060 --> 02:34:31,060
No, they don't they only put this stuff in the front end for you know as another feature

2812
02:34:31,060 --> 02:34:36,180
But they don't read your messages you're sending to other people and they don't track messages. That's a bunch of crap

2813
02:34:37,380 --> 02:34:43,420
Yes. Yeah, that's why I've been saying to all the people that have been sending me to these, you know

2814
02:34:43,420 --> 02:34:47,460
Yeah, I just tell them that by sending these messages

2815
02:34:47,460 --> 02:34:52,820
You're annoying crap out of other people and you're just showing how ignorant you are

2816
02:34:52,820 --> 02:34:58,020
I mean, you know using their prior example, I gave you know

2817
02:34:58,020 --> 02:35:01,300
You know, Microsoft's exclusives aren't going to read me

2818
02:35:01,300 --> 02:35:05,540
Microsoft's exclusives, you know, the pizza will fly out to someone's

2819
02:35:05,540 --> 02:35:12,900
Nellie reasons before those exclusives will show up on you know, PSG and vice versa

2820
02:35:12,900 --> 02:35:18,420
Exactly, that kind of stuff is just ridiculous that the exclusives would make their way to Sony

2821
02:35:18,420 --> 02:35:20,420
I mean people ought to know better

2822
02:35:20,420 --> 02:35:23,060
Did you have any other topics for us tonight Spaznier?

2823
02:35:23,060 --> 02:35:28,180
No, no, no, pretty much covers it

2824
02:35:28,180 --> 02:35:29,860
I'll probably let you go

2825
02:35:29,860 --> 02:35:34,020
I would imagine you probably want to squeeze in one more call and maybe close off afterwards

2826
02:35:34,020 --> 02:35:38,900
All right. Well, thank you as always Spaznier and keep on rocking the PlayStation

2827
02:35:38,900 --> 02:35:39,780
All right, have a good one

2828
02:35:39,780 --> 02:35:40,580
Take care

2829
02:35:40,580 --> 02:35:43,220
You know, actually I did buy a PS original not that long ago

2830
02:35:43,220 --> 02:35:48,100
I bought Unjamma Lamy on the PlayStation Network because you know, it's funny

2831
02:35:48,100 --> 02:35:49,860
I actually already own the disc for that

2832
02:35:49,860 --> 02:35:54,420
But I bought Unjamma Lamy just so I could have it on my PSP

2833
02:35:55,700 --> 02:35:56,900
So, hi, you're on Orange

2834
02:35:56,900 --> 02:35:58,180
I bought Parappa

2835
02:35:58,180 --> 02:35:58,820
Hi, you're on Orange

2836
02:35:58,820 --> 02:35:59,460
All right

2837
02:35:59,460 --> 02:36:00,100
Who's this?

2838
02:36:00,100 --> 02:36:01,140
Legend of Zaku

2839
02:36:01,140 --> 02:36:02,420
Hopefully now

2840
02:36:02,420 --> 02:36:04,020
Yes, we can hear you loud and clear

2841
02:36:04,020 --> 02:36:05,380
What's up Legend of Zaku?

2842
02:36:06,260 --> 02:36:10,900
Nothing much, just trying to kill just trying to kill another dull weekend and

2843
02:36:11,540 --> 02:36:13,300
aside from the Yanks winning

2844
02:36:13,300 --> 02:36:20,900
But yeah, I mean from basically what I've been seeing so far of PSP

2845
02:36:20,900 --> 02:36:22,900
Go has been getting a lot of flack

2846
02:36:22,900 --> 02:36:24,340
Most of it's actually deserving

2847
02:36:24,980 --> 02:36:27,460
Just for the fact that Sony is just done

2848
02:36:28,260 --> 02:36:34,340
They just haven't made it easy for existing PSP owners to give them the incentive to switch on

2849
02:36:35,140 --> 02:36:37,540
Especially when transferring existing UMDs

2850
02:36:38,100 --> 02:36:42,020
Did you see that story earlier this week where Reggie Fils-Aime has even come out and said

2851
02:36:42,020 --> 02:36:43,940
I don't get the PSP Go basically

2852
02:36:45,300 --> 02:36:49,060
Actually, I think he's right for the fact that for the most part

2853
02:36:49,060 --> 02:36:53,460
Every upgrade to the DS allowed people to play their old existing games

2854
02:36:54,100 --> 02:37:00,020
So in that sense, Sony's basically going two steps forward, one step back

2855
02:37:01,540 --> 02:37:02,980
Actually, no wait, what am I saying?

2856
02:37:02,980 --> 02:37:04,900
Two steps backward, one step forward

2857
02:37:04,900 --> 02:37:06,260
I like this, it's all right

2858
02:37:06,260 --> 02:37:09,860
I like this what Toa Gak says in our chat and I probably horribly mispronounced that name

2859
02:37:09,860 --> 02:37:10,660
I apologize

2860
02:37:10,660 --> 02:37:14,020
But Toa Gak says PSP Go equals PSP No

2861
02:37:14,900 --> 02:37:17,140
Exactly, I mean I have my original PS

2862
02:37:17,140 --> 02:37:20,260
I mean I have my slim PSP and I love it

2863
02:37:20,260 --> 02:37:23,940
You know, I love that thing to death just because I can play UMDs on it

2864
02:37:23,940 --> 02:37:28,260
So any new game that's still coming out, at least I have a hard copy of it

2865
02:37:28,260 --> 02:37:30,900
That's like something you'd see on a protest sign at a march or something

2866
02:37:32,740 --> 02:37:36,900
But I guess Sony really dropped the ball for this time around

2867
02:37:36,900 --> 02:37:39,620
They can put all the memory they want on a single unit

2868
02:37:39,620 --> 02:37:45,140
It's not going to change the fact that if you have your UMDs

2869
02:37:45,140 --> 02:37:46,900
They're practically obsolete at this point

2870
02:37:48,900 --> 02:37:50,020
You know, for new hardware

2871
02:37:50,820 --> 02:37:56,820
So it doesn't give people that incentive to just impulsively buy that new system

2872
02:37:58,260 --> 02:37:59,940
I want to read this comment in chat here real quick

2873
02:37:59,940 --> 02:38:04,100
Kutsune in chat says the PSP Go is only for those who don't already have a PSP

2874
02:38:04,100 --> 02:38:08,260
And I understand that point and I almost would agree with it

2875
02:38:08,260 --> 02:38:13,860
Almost, except I feel like with the PSP Go you get less choice than you have with the PSP 3000

2876
02:38:13,860 --> 02:38:15,540
Right, I mean you can't even sell

2877
02:38:16,180 --> 02:38:20,020
Everything's digital, there's no second-hand sales of games

2878
02:38:20,020 --> 02:38:25,300
Like you would with the UMD taking it to GameStop for money

2879
02:38:25,300 --> 02:38:31,380
If there was a faster processor, a second analog, something else in here

2880
02:38:31,380 --> 02:38:36,420
PS2 capability of games, something else in here I could recommend

2881
02:38:36,420 --> 02:38:37,620
I would be all about that

2882
02:38:37,620 --> 02:38:44,580
Right, if it was a brand new PSP, a new version of it

2883
02:38:44,580 --> 02:38:49,540
A completely new version outside of the fact that there's already been three so far

2884
02:38:51,060 --> 02:38:53,380
I mean that would be more than enough

2885
02:38:53,380 --> 02:38:59,460
But if it's more of the same with just like superficial tacked on features like Bluetooth

2886
02:38:59,460 --> 02:39:03,220
Which should have been in recent PSP iterations already

2887
02:39:03,220 --> 02:39:07,700
It just feels like Sony's like, you know, they're fucking up

2888
02:39:07,700 --> 02:39:10,820
You know, you're preaching to the choir here and it's tough

2889
02:39:10,820 --> 02:39:15,220
Because we want to give Sony credit for the things they're doing right on the PlayStation 3

2890
02:39:15,220 --> 02:39:17,300
But then you can't turn the blind eye on the Go

2891
02:39:17,300 --> 02:39:22,980
But the PSP, they're just acting like a bunch of chickens with their heads cut off

2892
02:39:22,980 --> 02:39:27,220
Because they don't even know how to make a product that not only new people would want

2893
02:39:27,220 --> 02:39:29,060
But the existing base

2894
02:39:30,100 --> 02:39:32,900
If you can't woo them, then that thing is dead in the water

2895
02:39:32,900 --> 02:39:34,340
Yeah, I agree

2896
02:39:34,340 --> 02:39:35,780
Well, what else is on your mind tonight, Zaku?

2897
02:39:37,300 --> 02:39:38,020
Nothing much

2898
02:39:38,020 --> 02:39:44,980
I mean except for the fact that, well, a few weeks ago I did attend an old-timers DDR tournament

2899
02:39:44,980 --> 02:39:47,700
Out on the break even though I didn't compete

2900
02:39:47,700 --> 02:39:52,580
It was basically a 32-man fifth mix tournament that took hours to complete

2901
02:39:53,620 --> 02:39:57,300
So that was the other highlight of these past few weeks

2902
02:39:58,740 --> 02:40:00,340
Eight on the break's a good arcade

2903
02:40:00,340 --> 02:40:04,100
I've been there, of course, and I haven't been there in a few years

2904
02:40:04,100 --> 02:40:06,980
Well, they put fifth mix already

2905
02:40:06,980 --> 02:40:08,260
They've been having that for months

2906
02:40:08,260 --> 02:40:12,260
And during Kings of the Coast, their big tournament in August

2907
02:40:12,260 --> 02:40:14,100
They were running a fourth mix plus tournament

2908
02:40:14,100 --> 02:40:16,820
So yeah, they're really throwing it back right over there

2909
02:40:16,820 --> 02:40:19,140
My love for eight on the break isn't just with the music games

2910
02:40:19,140 --> 02:40:22,500
But the fact that I didn't feel like that place was overrun with redemption games

2911
02:40:22,500 --> 02:40:23,460
It was a real arcade

2912
02:40:23,460 --> 02:40:24,740
Not only that, it's like cheap food

2913
02:40:24,740 --> 02:40:26,820
Four dollars will pretty much fill your stomach

2914
02:40:28,420 --> 02:40:28,900
Good point

2915
02:40:28,900 --> 02:40:31,300
Although it is, I wouldn't want to live on that food if you know what I mean

2916
02:40:32,260 --> 02:40:32,500
All right

2917
02:40:32,500 --> 02:40:32,980
I mean that

2918
02:40:33,620 --> 02:40:36,100
Zach, we're going to let you go to try and maybe squeeze in one more call

2919
02:40:36,100 --> 02:40:37,060
But thank you so much for the call

2920
02:40:37,060 --> 02:40:38,020
Okay, buddy

2921
02:40:38,020 --> 02:40:38,740
All right, have a good one

2922
02:40:38,740 --> 02:40:39,380
Go Yankees!

2923
02:40:40,100 --> 02:40:40,340
Yes

2924
02:40:40,980 --> 02:40:43,460
I always say that because my coworker loves the, I don't follow baseball

2925
02:40:43,460 --> 02:40:44,980
My coworker loves the Yankees

2926
02:40:44,980 --> 02:40:48,580
So I know that if the Yankees win, it's going to be a good day at work tomorrow

2927
02:40:48,580 --> 02:40:50,020
Because people will be happy

2928
02:40:50,020 --> 02:40:52,980
So actually I think that's going to do it for the Skype line tonight

2929
02:40:52,980 --> 02:40:54,500
So sorry to those that didn't get through

2930
02:40:54,500 --> 02:40:57,940
But you can always send us an email to mailbag at orangelauntrader.com

2931
02:40:57,940 --> 02:40:59,700
But for now, we want to go ahead and wrap up the show

2932
02:40:59,700 --> 02:41:02,980
And before we do that, we got to get everybody's final thoughts

2933
02:41:02,980 --> 02:41:05,300
Actually, I'm sorry, last minute stories if we have any left

2934
02:41:05,300 --> 02:41:06,900
I don't know if, Loki, you had anything else left

2935
02:41:08,180 --> 02:41:09,140
Well, let's see

2936
02:41:10,100 --> 02:41:11,380
I guess I could talk about

2937
02:41:12,100 --> 02:41:14,500
Well, they had a, you know, speaking of the PSP Go

2938
02:41:14,500 --> 02:41:19,540
There was a knockoff PSP Go-ish type device that was coming out

2939
02:41:20,260 --> 02:41:22,500
The PXP MP5

2940
02:41:23,140 --> 02:41:25,700
And I had to laugh though because some of the specs on it

2941
02:41:25,700 --> 02:41:29,140
Like it had a built-in camera, it could play emulation games and stuff like that

2942
02:41:29,140 --> 02:41:31,700
I'm like, wow, that's already better than the PSP Go

2943
02:41:32,660 --> 02:41:36,820
But yeah, I would imagine the camera is pretty low quality and all that stuff

2944
02:41:36,820 --> 02:41:38,100
It is a lot cheaper though

2945
02:41:38,100 --> 02:41:42,740
But it'll be interesting to see how much it actually sells

2946
02:41:42,740 --> 02:41:44,260
And I don't even know if we'll be able to tell that

2947
02:41:44,260 --> 02:41:47,300
Because it's going to be the PlayStation Portable Platform

2948
02:41:47,300 --> 02:41:49,060
And not necessarily the PSP Go

2949
02:41:49,060 --> 02:41:53,380
But yeah, I bet you it's going to just slump off to nothing by the time a holiday comes around

2950
02:41:53,380 --> 02:41:56,580
Are you able to figure out the real sales figures for PSP Go?

2951
02:41:56,580 --> 02:41:58,660
I don't know, they could do it with the DSI and the DS

2952
02:41:58,660 --> 02:42:01,620
So I wouldn't see why they wouldn't be able to at the PSP Go

2953
02:42:01,620 --> 02:42:06,260
But I know we're not selling a lot of them, that's for sure

2954
02:42:06,260 --> 02:42:07,540
A lot of people are backing out on them

2955
02:42:07,540 --> 02:42:11,300
We get a few people ordering like one in their store just to have it

2956
02:42:11,300 --> 02:42:14,260
But I don't think it's really

2957
02:42:14,260 --> 02:42:15,060
They never call back

2958
02:42:15,620 --> 02:42:17,300
No, no, they get it

2959
02:42:17,300 --> 02:42:20,740
And you know, they may reorder one here and there because people are looking for them

2960
02:42:20,740 --> 02:42:22,420
But they're not like pushing them, I guess

2961
02:42:22,420 --> 02:42:25,060
I see, all right

2962
02:42:25,060 --> 02:42:27,220
Well, that's it for last minute stories then

2963
02:42:27,220 --> 02:42:29,220
Let's go around and get everybody's final thought

2964
02:42:29,220 --> 02:42:33,700
Dark Sakura, thank you as always for your lovely contributions to the show

2965
02:42:33,700 --> 02:42:36,100
The Female Perspective, you're on Orange Lounge Radio

2966
02:42:36,740 --> 02:42:37,700
When I can't provide it

2967
02:42:38,260 --> 02:42:39,540
Dark Sakura, your final thought?

2968
02:42:40,740 --> 02:42:44,020
I want frozen yogurt, but I'm not going to have any

2969
02:42:44,900 --> 02:42:47,300
Sorry to hear that because frozen yogurt is amazing

2970
02:42:47,300 --> 02:42:47,780
Fro-Yo

2971
02:42:48,340 --> 02:42:48,980
We should go

2972
02:42:49,780 --> 02:42:52,100
We should, but I don't think the show will be over in time

2973
02:42:52,100 --> 02:42:53,540
This isn't that place close at 10?

2974
02:42:53,540 --> 02:42:53,780
Yeah

2975
02:42:53,780 --> 02:42:54,660
Yeah, we have Afterbirth

2976
02:42:54,660 --> 02:42:56,420
So I think we have three new songs tonight, right?

2977
02:42:57,140 --> 02:42:57,380
Yeah

2978
02:42:57,380 --> 02:42:57,780
We do

2979
02:42:58,740 --> 02:42:59,780
Did you win last?

2980
02:42:59,780 --> 02:43:00,340
I don't remember

2981
02:43:00,340 --> 02:43:02,580
You won't win anything because my song was all fucked up

2982
02:43:02,580 --> 02:43:03,700
I won't talk about during Afterbirth

2983
02:43:04,260 --> 02:43:06,660
Loki, your final thought tonight?

2984
02:43:06,660 --> 02:43:12,420
I need to move the cabinet into the house and then the next project is to rebuild the DVR pads

2985
02:43:12,420 --> 02:43:14,420
Already have them designed and everything

2986
02:43:14,420 --> 02:43:15,380
They're gonna be awesome

2987
02:43:17,060 --> 02:43:20,100
My final thought for the day is happy national coming out day

2988
02:43:20,100 --> 02:43:22,420
And equality for all means just that

2989
02:43:22,420 --> 02:43:24,260
Equal rights for all

2990
02:43:24,260 --> 02:43:25,860
Equal, equal, equal

2991
02:43:25,860 --> 02:43:31,060
There is no such thing as a domestic partnership being equal rights in any way shape or form

2992
02:43:31,060 --> 02:43:33,940
I had one of my friends actually, it was funny that you mentioned that

2993
02:43:33,940 --> 02:43:36,900
Last weekend he came up and stuff, he came out to me

2994
02:43:36,900 --> 02:43:38,660
He's been apparently married

2995
02:43:39,300 --> 02:43:40,820
He got married during that time too

2996
02:43:41,620 --> 02:43:42,900
That it was legal

2997
02:43:42,900 --> 02:43:43,380
And so

2998
02:43:44,020 --> 02:43:46,100
Oh, it's part of the 18,000

2999
02:43:46,100 --> 02:43:46,340
Yeah

3000
02:43:46,340 --> 02:43:49,380
Oh, I thought you meant this was like a married man to a woman who came out too

3001
02:43:49,380 --> 02:43:50,500
Because that could be very difficult

3002
02:43:50,500 --> 02:43:52,180
I've met men who have gone through

3003
02:43:52,180 --> 02:43:52,820
No, no, no, no

3004
02:43:52,820 --> 02:43:53,140
Okay

3005
02:43:53,140 --> 02:43:54,820
No, no idea whatsoever

3006
02:43:54,820 --> 02:43:57,300
But he's had a boyfriend for like, you know, ever since

3007
02:43:57,300 --> 02:44:01,780
Even like during like when he came to our wedding stuff

3008
02:44:01,780 --> 02:44:02,660
You've actually met him

3009
02:44:03,540 --> 02:44:06,340
But, you know, I was like, why didn't you bring him?

3010
02:44:06,340 --> 02:44:08,020
I'm like, that would have been okay

3011
02:44:08,020 --> 02:44:10,260
But he's just, he's not coming out there but yet

3012
02:44:10,260 --> 02:44:12,820
I met a lot of people at your wedding so I probably wouldn't remember him

3013
02:44:12,820 --> 02:44:14,580
But props

3014
02:44:14,580 --> 02:44:14,820
I

3015
02:44:14,820 --> 02:44:18,980
Because California is the only state where like some marriages are legal

3016
02:44:18,980 --> 02:44:20,980
And they don't know how to explain how it works

3017
02:44:20,980 --> 02:44:22,420
Let me give you a hint California

3018
02:44:22,420 --> 02:44:23,540
Here's how to get it right

3019
02:44:23,540 --> 02:44:26,100
Equal, equal, equal

3020
02:44:26,100 --> 02:44:26,820
Across the board

3021
02:44:26,820 --> 02:44:28,020
That's how you do it

3022
02:44:28,020 --> 02:44:29,940
There's no reason for it

3023
02:44:30,820 --> 02:44:34,340
No religious text should ever take away equality

3024
02:44:34,340 --> 02:44:34,660
Ever

3025
02:44:35,380 --> 02:44:35,940
So

3026
02:44:35,940 --> 02:44:36,420
Anyhow

3027
02:44:36,980 --> 02:44:37,300
That's it

3028
02:44:37,300 --> 02:44:38,420
I'll get off my soapbox now

3029
02:44:38,980 --> 02:44:39,620
That's gonna do it

3030
02:44:39,620 --> 02:44:40,980
For another episode of Orange on its Radio

3031
02:44:40,980 --> 02:44:42,260
Thank you guys so much for tuning into us

3032
02:44:42,260 --> 02:44:43,620
We had a really good listener count tonight

3033
02:44:43,620 --> 02:44:45,700
Especially considering we've been off for a week

3034
02:44:45,700 --> 02:44:46,900
So that must mean you missed us

3035
02:44:46,900 --> 02:44:47,780
So thank you very much

3036
02:44:47,780 --> 02:44:50,820
And you don't hate us too much for falling behind on the podcast feed and all that stuff

3037
02:44:50,820 --> 02:44:52,340
Hey I bet their aim's improving

3038
02:44:52,340 --> 02:44:53,140
I bet so too

3039
02:44:53,140 --> 02:44:55,300
But we'll be back next week to do it all again

3040
02:44:55,300 --> 02:44:57,220
I don't know if we have anything special planned for next week

3041
02:44:57,220 --> 02:45:00,260
Unfortunately we're not doing the big gaming marathon next week

3042
02:45:00,260 --> 02:45:03,700
But if you aren't already tuning into it somewhere

3043
02:45:03,700 --> 02:45:06,420
Please be sure you're watching the Extra Life marathon somewhere

3044
02:45:06,980 --> 02:45:09,860
That's all Sarcastic Gamer and other podcasts is doing that

3045
02:45:09,860 --> 02:45:14,100
And you know we are all for the Extra Life marathon

3046
02:45:14,100 --> 02:45:16,340
That is going to happen around the internet on Saturday

3047
02:45:16,340 --> 02:45:18,020
So please look for that and donate

3048
02:45:18,020 --> 02:45:19,940
I'm sure there'll be other ones later on

3049
02:45:19,940 --> 02:45:23,220
Oh yeah we'll participate in something later on

3050
02:45:23,220 --> 02:45:25,620
For sure a good cause somewhere

3051
02:45:25,620 --> 02:45:26,660
But that's going to do it for now

3052
02:45:26,660 --> 02:45:28,100
For us have a great week everybody

3053
02:45:28,100 --> 02:45:30,500
We'll see you next week on Orange Lounge Radio

3054
02:45:30,500 --> 02:45:34,740
If you've enjoyed the show all we ask you just tell a couple people about the show

3055
02:45:34,740 --> 02:45:36,260
Help spread by word of mouth

3056
02:45:36,260 --> 02:45:39,060
Because remember that's all we've got to promote Orange Lounge Radio

3057
02:45:39,060 --> 02:45:44,180
We don't have any fancy magazines or big million hits a month website to back us up

3058
02:45:44,180 --> 02:45:46,980
We only have you guys to help spread the word

3059
02:45:46,980 --> 02:45:48,740
So that's it have a great week

3060
02:45:48,740 --> 02:46:15,540
We'll see you next time here on Orange Lounge Radio

3061
02:46:18,740 --> 02:46:20,660
But we're probably right anyway

3062
02:46:20,660 --> 02:46:48,420
See you next week
