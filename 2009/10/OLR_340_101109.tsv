13933	15855	Good night, October 11th, 2009.
16216	19239	Epic Mickey is confirmed this week as a real game.
19560	23825	Could you soon see the Wii balance board used in Airport Security and the Commodore 64?
31297	37379	Hello everybody out there on the internet, on their iPods, on allgames.com, or however you're listening to our show.
37459	39999	Welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
40019	45981	We are that show dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.
46001	49022	We like to think of ourselves as the show where every gamer has a voice.
49542	56224	With you here every week is myself, Rob Roberts, and joining me as always, say hello to the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.
56764	57144	Yo.
57424	58305	How are you doing, DarkSakura?
58725	59285	I'm doing great.
59665	59885	Good.
60145	60446	Good to hear.
60466	60726	Yeah.
61286	62067	And guess what?
62227	62407	What?
62667	63467	I don't have to work tomorrow.
63968	64588	Lucky you.
64668	67110	What is up with... Who celebrates Columbus Day anymore?
67230	68010	Banks, apparently.
68330	69091	Colombians.
70073	73215	Also joining us, say hello to Techmaster, Loki.
73456	73816	Hello.
73836	74556	How are you doing, Loki?
74697	75277	I'm doing good.
75497	75777	Awesome.
76698	78859	How was your couple weeks off?
78939	82422	Because you missed the mini-show we did.
82442	83643	We talked about that before.
84363	86825	I guess you just kind of spaced it on Tuesday.
87065	89587	I had crap going on on Tuesday, so I forgot all about it.
89927	93250	So we pre-recorded so that, you know, because it's been weird.
93290	95872	We've missed a couple weeks and that's all my fault, I apologize.
96233	100636	But we pre-recorded a show for last week and Loki, you just kind of didn't come.
101157	102338	Yeah, I spaced.
102458	103359	You were better than that show.
104420	104740	Sorry.
105260	108984	What did you get done last Sunday in absence of Orange Haunch Radio?
109464	110505	I put in sprinklers.
110865	111106	Yeah?
111626	112627	Yeah, that was not fun.
114229	114690	Thanks for watching!
130168	132048	I don't know.
132088	140490	When you're digging that stuff out, especially if you dig it out onto grass and stuff like that, you end up losing some of the dirt because you just can't scrape all of it out of the grass.
141511	144972	There's big divots where all the pipes are.
145852	148612	At the same time, we also chop through the cable line, which is fun.
149673	150573	We had to fix that too.
150753	153374	They went in.
153414	153754	They work.
154054	159095	I ran them today trying to flush out the water because now our water out of our fridge tastes like crap.
160302	160942	DarkSakura.com
187569	188570	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
214684	215844	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
234810	235150	Robocop Window
263467	264608	Yeah, I saw them last week.
265669	265969	Bunnies?
266029	266610	In the neighbor's yard.
267371	268752	Wow.
269152	270213	Sorry.
270273	271855	I heard a rooster earlier and now bunnies.
271895	273216	Are we out on a farm today or something?
273236	276720	Well, our neighbors across the street, they let their bunnies run wild all over the neighborhood.
277420	278761	And they usually like to hang out in my yard.
279802	281964	So we have stray bunnies.
282505	282845	Gotcha.
283126	284347	And not stray dogs or cats.
284767	285448	We have stray bunnies.
286088	287349	Been watching Dan play more ODST?
288599	289680	That game makes me motion sick.
289920	290740	I don't really care for it.
291621	291981	Gotcha.
292021	294342	I'm like, ugh, turn off this loud piece of crap.
295383	300385	But Dan loves it, so if he's having fun with it, then he can have fun, just not when I'm trying to go to bed.
300566	307049	And just for folks who are newer to the show who may not know, you've never been a fan of first-person shooters because they just make you ill.
307269	309250	Well, I liked them before they used 3D.
310571	312272	When they were sprite-based, great.
312792	314533	Like Wolfenstein was fine, right?
314913	316074	Yeah, and Doom.
316094	316174	Doom.
317543	317843	All right.
318164	318804	Well, let's move on.
318865	320066	Loki, how was your gaming week?
320246	322088	My gaming week was pretty good, I guess.
323450	329176	I played more Grand Theft Auto Lost and Damned, where I'm up to almost rank five.
329196	334061	I would have been ranked five on Friday, but I dropped out of one of my games, so...
335202	336103	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
356240	384371	and then was it my sister's 360 died so now and it's funny hers died the same way as my last one did where it basically lost its graphics processor you know got like a green tint to it and then the whole thing just no video anymore so that kind of sucked there's no real way to fix that and obviously it's not under warranty since hers is modded as well so that doesn't work but we have a way to remedy that soon enough and then um
386597	388658	I played some DJ Hero.
388898	395401	I have a demo unit that I got, and I've been playing the four songs that are on there.
395541	408566	Well, three technically in the set, and then there's a fourth one, which is like a DJ versus guitar song in there, which I didn't really play that much of because not a lot of people wanted to play guitar.
409547	412448	And then I've been having a lot of fun with that.
414025	420830	The controller is pretty nice, although since it is a demo unit, it's wired instead of wireless, which is fine.
420931	423873	I don't really give a crap, because I hate replacing batteries anyways.
425510	445654	and um the only thing that sucks about those you can't flip it because the way the chord comes out it actually um would be in the way if you flipped it to left-handed um i guess lefty side um although for me i don't really care because i'm right-handed but my co-worker wasn't he wanted to really try it and i'm like dude sorry you can't so he had to play cross-handed
446496	446676	DJ Hero
471048	473270	They may not like it because it's nothing like 2DX.
473731	475012	It's more like Guitar Hero.
475332	478776	It's just like the comparison of 2DX and Guitar Hero.
478816	480958	They're really not similar at all.
481018	483580	Other than you have notes coming down the screen, but that's about it.
485702	491628	The scratching in the game is almost like strumming on the guitar a little bit.
491788	492229	And then...
493584	495146	Thanks for watching!
511673	512213	Thanks for watching!
531715	532616	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
555612	556533	But you'll pick it up pretty quick.
556634	561882	I mean, just from watching the videos, I started off playing Medium, and I picked it up pretty quick.
562915	563876	I kind of want to try hard.
563896	565377	I haven't gotten a chance to do that yet.
565677	570981	Because also, the demo too kind of sucks because you can't calibrate it because it is a demo.
571802	574024	And so, on the TV we're playing, there's some lag.
574244	579268	And so, trying to fix that, you know, you kind of have to compensate for it.
579328	580849	But in the full version, you will be able to calibrate it.
580869	582370	Yeah, in the full version, it'll have all that stuff.
582430	586634	It's just, you know, because it's just a basic demo, they don't have that built in.
587154	588775	Now, this game's going to cost $130, right?
588815	588775	$120.
588835	588975	We are...
592732	593513	I think it's $120.
593613	594814	Well, after tax, $130.
594854	597056	$130, yeah.
597096	597577	Let's be real.
597937	599859	So this game is going to set you back about $130.
600440	601360	Who should drop?
601701	602802	I mean, that's a big investment.
602882	605384	I mean, for $70 more, you can buy a console.
605404	606365	For $20 more, you can buy a Wii.
606826	608547	That's as much as a Nintendo DS.
609048	610389	Who should drop $130 on this game?
610409	611450	Who should not drop $130 on this game?
613832	614212	DarkSakura?
614232	617333	I was going to say, don't drop the money on this game if you're on food stamps.
617373	618433	Well, duh, DarkSakura.
618493	621874	I mean, yeah, if it's not in your budget, then it's not in your budget.
621894	623795	But, I mean, if, you know, you're debating...
641940	651865	And the other thing you've got to understand is, unlike Guitar Hero and Rock Band, this controller is only going to work with this game.
652245	653086	So far.
653386	653806	So far.
653906	655087	I mean, it's not going to work.
655667	658849	Harmonix is not going to come out with a DJ game that's going to be exactly like this.
659389	662831	And so you're not going to have uniformity that way.
662951	663111	So...
664202	667425	You've got to be really willing to stick to this series.
667545	668105	And you know what?
668846	671608	After playing the three songs in there, I'm fine with dropping the money.
672428	679414	And I'll be honest, I know a lot of people frown upon buying demos, but yes, I bought this demo unit.
679634	681916	And yes, it's the same one that you saw on Destructoid.
682356	683156	I bought that unit.
683277	684417	I paid the money to buy it.
684578	685939	And yeah, I know it's retarded, but...
686919	690660	I had nefarious intentions, trust me, originally.
690760	695882	But having played it, I probably am going to buy the full game only because I can get it early.
696182	699202	And that's really why I'm excited to play this game.
699242	701823	But if I wanted to, I could pirate it.
701863	705924	But I'm not going to because I want to play it early.
706244	711746	I wasn't going to say anything about how you got this game because most people would assume you get it through your work channels.
712406	713926	No, my work doesn't hook me up for crap.
714066	715647	What possessed you to...
717290	718351	Drop that money on it.
719212	720172	Because I wanted to play it.
722534	723775	Because I'm impatient.
724375	727138	And because I figured, hey, you know what?
727178	730560	I can drop the money on this demo unit and the controller works just fine.
730720	731381	And you know what?
732586	739869	I have the means to play modded games on my console, so if I really want to not spend the money, I can do that.
740809	747911	Only you can tell you how to spend your money, and the wife now, because that's part of the whole marriage thing, but hopefully she liked it too.
748772	754674	She hasn't really seen it, she's just like, I don't know, she laughed because Hollaback Girl was in the demo, but...
756320	769737	I don't care, you know, because if I don't want to buy the game, I can still play the game, technically, but I'm not condoning piracy or anything, and not a lot of people will be pirating this game anyway, since, you know, you need a controller for it, so...
771038	771638	All right.
771858	772918	Let me go to our chat room.
772938	775379	We always have the chat comments here.
775459	779960	Chat.OrangeLoungeRadio.com But for the record, though, I am buying the game on top of this.
780300	783121	So I have two controllers for party situations and stuff like that.
783401	788182	And actually, I want to lead into our first chat comment tonight from our chat room that kind of gets into this a little bit.
788462	798085	And our first chat comment tonight comes from our buddy Derek H., who actually hosts another show here on AllGames.com, Dead Pixel Live, which would technically be the next show on after Orange Lounge Radio.
798165	799305	Just you have to wait until Monday.
800046	802668	Derek H says, $130, it's Catch-22.
802708	810096	To be worth it, you'd need to have a lot of friends, but if you have a lot of friends, you're not a person who spends $130 on a video game.
811137	811698	I don't know, though.
812359	815041	I get the funny he's trying to make there, but what about Rock Band?
815081	816443	Rock Band's a party game.
816463	816943	I don't know.
817003	818065	I looked at it.
818725	819246	I thought about it.
822506	823206	But I went with it.
823366	824626	I went for it, and you know what?
824686	825727	I'm not regretting it.
826487	829347	It sounds like you had people over to play this game.
829487	830608	Well, at work, yeah.
830888	832328	We checked it out and stuff like that.
832668	835669	I had it hooked up for an entire day and that kind of thing.
836109	839289	Yeah, it's fun.
839890	841290	I am looking forward to it.
841370	847011	Really, I could just skip paying the extra $200 or $100.
847171	848731	I'm not buying the Renegade Edition, that's for sure.
849692	851492	I have a bag to carry the system in.
852651	853152	And you know what?
853392	857276	I don't really need a table to play it on because I played it in my lap just fine.
858037	860980	So don't buy it, especially if you don't like rap music like me.
861080	866146	I'm not really huge into hip-hop and rap music, so not for me.
866586	869749	But yeah, I am planning on picking it up because...
871038	871779	I've been working on that.
899045	900186	and DarkSakura.com
928334	931800	Also, need to move it in the house.
932401	935607	Oh, and install Windows and stuff onto my actual PC.
935647	938011	Because I actually had to custom build a PC to...
940267	940527	DarkSakura
971309	975350	So you can see there, like, I had to drill three more holes for, like, additional buttons.
975450	980071	And then if you scroll all the way to the bottom there, you can see... Boy, did you make a mess of your garage.
980191	981711	Oh, the garage is a mess, yeah.
982111	984392	I remember when you moved in, that was pristine.
984412	984892	Okay, sorry.
985092	985832	I just... No.
986232	988553	So I had to drill new buttons, but that's the piece here.
988733	991113	It's a huge... But it's all mounted to a piece of wood.
991773	993854	I had to make custom buttons and stuff like that.
994554	996836	I will post this to our Twitter feed if you're okay with that.
996956	999738	I already posted a link to my Twitter.
999978	1003401	Folks listening on the podcast can go back and check that out if they want to see it.
1004101	1004502	Very cool.
1004942	1005783	Some questions from chat.
1005823	1008525	TigerClaw wants to know, so you mounted a motherboard to it.
1008585	1009325	What about cooling?
1009365	1011407	Are there any vents on the back, an extra amount of fans?
1011877	1014099	No, I don't think that I really need all that stuff.
1014299	1018062	I mean, the cabinet's pretty open in the inside anyways.
1018183	1028311	I mean, there's a fan on the processor, fan on the graphics card, but I don't think it's going to get too hot because I'm really not... I mean, MAME, I don't think it's going to strain that processor too much.
1029292	1029953	So we'll see.
1030033	1032275	If I need to put a fan in there, I can.
1033196	1035738	But, I mean, I don't know.
1035858	1036739	I don't think it needs it.
1037319	1038060	I think it'll be fine.
1040011	1040712	But we'll play it by ear.
1041012	1042733	I just put that on the Twitter, by the way.
1042853	1043314	So there you go.
1044695	1046076	Anything else, Loki?
1046296	1046576	That's it.
1047377	1048037	My Gaming Week.
1048077	1049799	I've actually had some time to play some games this week.
1049919	1052821	I just want to point this out, and I know I'm going to get criticized by a lot of folks.
1053261	1054062	I still haven't fixed the 360.
1054442	1057444	I kind of don't need to right now.
1057645	1062869	I've totally been happy in my gaming world with World of Warcraft, of course, and PlayStation 3.
1062909	1062929	I...
1064730	1065771	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1093918	1094518	Here's the thing, though.
1094578	1096079	Demon's Souls is not for everybody.
1097639	1098219	From what I hear.
1098419	1099400	It is hard.
1099660	1102180	I've dropped probably four or five hours in this game.
1102280	1103821	I've rolled three different characters.
1104321	1108902	I've beaten the tutorial level, and I consistently get my ass handed to me in the first level.
1109302	1110662	It is that hard of a game.
1111062	1112903	This game is the Mega Man 9
1113963	1115044	of roleplaying games.
1115124	1121230	Although I don't want to think roleplaying games as like Final Fantasy roleplaying games because it's more of an action-y RPG.
1121670	1124052	Think a little more like Oblivion in the third person.
1125194	1128136	This game is so hardcore, it's like D&D.
1128737	1130518	I mean, you have to consider everything.
1130558	1134943	You have to consider the weights of the weapons you're carrying, all these different statistics.
1134963	1136184	There's no pause.
1136384	1139066	There is no pause in this game because the game's online.
1140107	1141768	Um, and this is the interesting thing.
1141808	1147309	This is the part that makes Demon's Souls fascinating is the online component because it's not an MMO.
1147790	1149610	It's not a single player role playing game.
1149650	1152071	Let me give you an idea of the types of stuff you do in this game.
1152511	1158853	You can leave markings on the ground that have little messages for other people, but you can't type in your own messages.
1158913	1159433	Sorry, Loki.
1159874	1163935	You have to choose from like a predetermined set that's kind of works like a Mad Lib.
1164355	1164896	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1181792	1183693	You might suddenly see a message pop on your screen.
1183833	1187574	Your message has been rated up and you get a little bit of life point back.
1187934	1190735	Which is good because otherwise you can't really get it back very easily.
1191375	1194696	And then if it sucks, well your message just never shows up in other people's worlds.
1194916	1197417	The less it gets rated, the less it just goes away.
1197917	1199918	The other component is that you'll have bloodstains.
1199998	1205140	When people die in the world, their bloodstain appears and you can touch the bloodstain and watch how they died.
1205933	1206553	That's awesome.
1206773	1207713	Which is kind of interesting.
1208434	1213215	It helps you learn lessons because there's little surprises around every corner and all this stuff.
1213675	1215715	So here's the thing, though.
1215755	1217116	Here's how unforgiving the game is.
1217596	1219416	The currency of the game is souls.
1219576	1221477	You get souls by beating monsters.
1221957	1225638	If you die in a level, you go all the way back to start.
1225978	1231739	You lose all your souls, all of them, and the whole level starts over.
1232879	1238423	If you can get back to where your blood stain was and touch it, you get all your souls back.
1238923	1240644	If you die again, you're fucked.
1241005	1241405	It's gone.
1241925	1242686	You lose everything.
1243646	1245327	This game is not messing around.
1245848	1248610	It is a very, very difficult game.
1248830	1251732	When I say it is the Mega Man 9 of role-playing games, I'm not kidding.
1251772	1253093	Because you know how Mega Man 9 is?
1253433	1258676	You have to go in, you have to die, die, die, and learn a distinct pattern in how to beat the level.
1258916	1261978	And then once you learn the pattern to beat the level, it's never a problem again.
1262259	1262479	Right?
1263239	1265181	That's very similar to what this game is.
1265481	1268143	Because as I'm going through the level... Oh, demon hiding behind the wood.
1268244	1269765	Oh, demon hiding around the corner.
1269905	1270886	Oh, two demons over here.
1271206	1272747	You start to learn the patterns.
1273288	1277511	It just is difficult still for me because a lot of it has to do with timing.
1277952	1284457	If you want to beat really hard enemies, you have to be able to block and then basically jab your sword into the enemy.
1284477	1286779	It gets really hard.
1287279	1287439	So...
1288420	1292221	I'm just saying, this game is not fucking around with the difficulty.
1292541	1296422	So if you think you're going to throw a controller across the room, you probably will.
1297082	1301083	And that's where you might need to decide if this game's worth dropping $60 on or not.
1301143	1306865	Because I think the challenge is this game's biggest asset and it's its game's biggest drawback.
1307365	1308286	It's our type.
1331169	1333029	is it a rewarding experience though?
1333369	1359334	heck yeah, because it feels really good when you are able to successfully beat a level and get past a point you've never got before that's a reward you haven't really seen since like 8-bit gaming days one other thing I do want to say about online mode I haven't gotten to this part myself but apparently this gets in later on after you beat the first couple levels is that when you die or I guess some of the stains on the floor start being that you can warp yourself
1359794	1362915	into someone else's world and help them beat the boss.
1363635	1367436	Or you can go into someone else's world as a black phantom and try to kill them.
1368336	1371237	So now you can be the enemy in someone else's world.
1371377	1373438	And you get rewarded if you kill the other player.
1373738	1375058	But here's the other thing to keep in mind.
1375318	1377019	There is no friends list in this game.
1377459	1379019	There is no voice chat in the game.
1379360	1380980	It is all anonymous.
1381560	1383521	So when you're the black phantom, you're a silent killer.
1383561	1384481	They don't even know who killed them.
1386104	1405647	and the tricky thing about being the phantom is that if you're just out there, I think they purposely make the phantoms a little weaker, but if you know the levels, if you've really worked at the levels and you kind of know the good hiding spaces like around corners and stuff, you can just beat the shit out of somebody that you storm in their level.
1405747	1410348	Loki, I think you would sit there all day and be the black phantom on people's levels and have fun with it.
1411908	1414149	You should see me play Grand Theft Auto, man.
1414249	1414269	I
1415279	1418400	What we've been doing now, we have random people coming into our games.
1418420	1419520	Because we do ranked games now.
1419560	1425622	So basically, if you sign on to a ranked game when we're online playing a ranked game, or in the lobby, you will be in our ranked game.
1426623	1428964	And then I will mock you on our end.
1428984	1433825	Because no one realizes that all five of us, or four of us, are in the same room.
1434185	1436426	So we'll be like, okay, he's coming around the corner.
1436786	1437106	Boom!
1437246	1439447	Just knock the guy down.
1439647	1441868	Not really gang up on them, but we'll help each other.
1443252	1445513	Oh man, I talk shit when other people are in there.
1446133	1446553	It's awesome.
1446613	1452655	Go into some comments from our chat, chat.orangelonsradio.com Kitsune says, by that means they can come into your world and kill you.
1453056	1453736	Yes, they can.
1454056	1459278	I am told the game warns you when a black phantom has entered your level, but it doesn't tell you anything beyond that.
1460078	1488901	and let's see, HitStun says this sounds awesome, too bad it's a PS3 exclusive, that's actually my point HitStun, that's why I said kind of before I went into this story, you know, Sony's finally gaining some ground moving into this holiday season, you know Sony PS3 has had some great exclusives, for the platformers they have LittleBigPlanet, for the first person shooters they have Resistance, now they have something for the action RPGers and that's Demon's Souls, and to some extent you could say Valkyria Chronicles 2, although that's more of a, you know, um
1490683	1492064	Why can't I think of the name all of a sudden?
1492104	1494667	The strategy, RTS game, thank you.
1495067	1496829	Leo Shen wants to know how far did I get?
1496909	1499532	Dude, I can't even beat Bolteria Palace 1-1.
1499912	1501594	That's how hard this game is.
1501934	1505398	Like, I keep getting killed by the blue-eyed guy.
1505698	1507140	But I'm trying.
1507520	1511204	I keep re-rolling characters to think it can... I actually hear...
1511704	1526891	the easiest way through it is with the royalty character because even though they start at the lowest level they have the soul arrow so that's what I'm trying to do now but I'm finding it makes you really weak so I got gang raped by two fire wielding guys like I can't even get back to where I was with my soldier so whoo
1527691	1529352	Anyhow, Demon's Souls is the name of the game.
1531012	1536694	One other game I do want to mention that I played, another PS3 exclusive, go figure, Katamari Forever on the PlayStation 3.
1536975	1538175	I did pick up this week, finally.
1538935	1540476	It's a little cheaper than Demon's Souls.
1540516	1541336	Demon's Souls sent me back $60.
1541836	1543057	I believe Katamari Forever was...
1543757	1544718	Thank you for watching!
1566082	1569483	and some of the other online games I've been missing out on while my 360's been broken.
1570824	1572685	But I will say Katamari Forever is really cool.
1572825	1573965	I love the way it controls.
1574345	1576786	The music is cute, having it back in the levels.
1576907	1582669	I have to admit I haven't fully explored the game because I've been kind of a little busy playing Demon's Souls and getting killed in that game.
1583089	1591651	But I'm already having more fun with this than I was the 360 version of the game, even though this admittedly is a rehash of, you know, a lot of the levels.
1592011	1595212	But what I like is that they do put new elements in the levels.
1595572	1598653	You can go back and play the old levels as the old levels if you want.
1598973	1605335	And to be honest, I haven't played the game in so long that, you know, all the levels are feeling new to me again after, you know, two, three years of not playing it.
1606535	1611737	But I do think the price point may be a little high, considering that a lot of it is recycled.
1612057	1616379	If you've never played Katamari Damacy before, though, this is a really good entry-level game.
1616819	1621100	If you have all the other games, you might want to wait for a price drop.
1621220	1626682	I just think for a lot of folks, $50, unless you're a hardcore fan of the series, you're going to be like, come on, too much.
1627262	1628903	So, there you go.
1630958	1632919	All right, so that was pretty much my gaming week.
1633839	1636120	I did play some other stuff, but I've talked too much about the other games.
1636560	1637700	I want to get into some gaming news.
1637740	1638580	I know you guys do too.
1638940	1639620	We're going to get into it.
1639920	1641281	First off, some housekeeping real quick.
1641821	1643421	The podcast feed is behind.
1643741	1646022	I'm sorry about that, but vacations will do that.
1646682	1650823	I did get 338 on the feed tonight, so all that's left is 339 in the mini show.
1651363	1653384	So those will go up this week before this week's show does.
1654804	1655104	DarkSakura.com
1683470	1684090	That's really it.
1684150	1685951	Otherwise, go ahead and add us on Twitter.
1686691	1688912	We are soon going to have a new Facebook fan page.
1688952	1697076	I know we have our Facebook forums, but we're actually going to work on building a fan page so that way we can notify you about new shows in your friend feed if you want.
1697156	1700177	If you don't want it, add us anyway and then block our updates, whatever.
1700977	1704599	But we're going to actually work on an official Orange Launch Radio page that will hopefully be open this week.
1704919	1709041	And then, of course, we still have our live journal, our website, orangelaunchradio.com, and so forth.
1709821	1711642	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1728250	1733114	Epic Mickey has been confirmed via the newest Game Informer.
1733535	1734336	It's on the cover.
1735016	1737558	And, of course, they have the inside story about that as well.
1737899	1741201	The game is being done by War Inspector.
1741902	1743884	And it's actually pretty sweet looking.
1743904	1754913	It takes place kind of in this dark Disney-type world where Mickey will actually be facing up against some forgotten Disney characters who are all really...
1756054	1756835	Thanks for watching!
1774025	1774685	Thank you for watching!
1796038	1798220	It's a pretty epic looking RPG.
1798380	1801462	Have we seen much outside of the one screenshot that's on the magazine cover?
1802723	1806266	They've had artwork put out from it and it looks really dark.
1806426	1808628	I'm almost surprised it's even on the Wii.
1809554	1815357	Well, you know, the Wii's kind of needed something like Epic Mickey, so I get it, and I'm going to give it a chance.
1815457	1822021	You know, I think a lot of people are like, boo, this isn't coming to 360 or PS3, you know, it can't be that epic.
1822061	1827404	But I'm saying, wait a minute, give this a chance, because what this game's trying to do is fill a niche that the Wii doesn't have.
1827944	1833507	Because the Wii right now is known as a shovelware system, with the occasional awesome Metroid or Mario game.
1833668	1834228	I mean, right?
1834508	1835449	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1855111	1857753	I don't know when this is going to be coming out.
1858213	1859994	If it's spring of next year, it might be too early.
1860034	1866298	Maybe they don't have time to work with development kits for Natal or whatever they're calling the PlayStation 3 motion controller.
1867519	1868760	We'll see more of these games later on.
1868900	1874864	And who's to say that they couldn't, if this is really popular, do a sequel, be on all platforms, or even port this later on.
1875864	1877425	So I wouldn't rule it out.
1878066	1879387	Well, here's my thing, though.
1879647	1881668	What's wrong with Kingdom Hearts?
1881868	1884010	I mean, isn't Kingdom Hearts, in a way, Epic Mickey?
1884030	1884070	No.
1884847	1886808	I mean, I realize that games are going to be different.
1886848	1889209	I realize this is not going to be a role-playing game or what have you.
1889609	1893411	But I kind of look at this and go, is this going to kill off Kingdom Hearts?
1893551	1894772	Because that's kind of too bad.
1895112	1898413	Because Kingdom Hearts, I always thought, was kind of an epic Mickey.
1898493	1898953	I mean, yeah.
1898973	1900314	I mean, they can coexist.
1900954	1901595	I hope so.
1902535	1909478	But, I mean, there was always those rumors that Kingdom Hearts 3, whenever it actually happens, was going to do away with the Disney.
1909998	1911598	I mean, is that what we're looking at?
1912299	1913539	Now that Disney is over here?
1913619	1917480	I mean, I guess we don't know until we really get some final words on Kingdom Hearts 3.
1917520	1917580	But...
1919281	1920081	I'm not really sure.
1920121	1921762	I never played the DS version that just came out, so...
1940233	1942074	X-Link confirms yes, there is a lot in the games.
1942094	1944336	So whatever I heard about Disney being fade out.
1968953	1970537	Fazed Out is just a sick rumor.
1971039	1974829	Although, I will tell you, being at Disneyland twice in the past month
1976058	1978179	There isn't a lot of Kingdom Hearts.
1978219	1980821	In fact, there is no Kingdom Hearts references in either park.
1981321	1985183	Which, you know, I understand because Square Enix, that's really their thing.
1985203	1988985	But you would think, you know, it still raises Disney awareness.
1989045	1993588	It's kind of a bummer they don't have at least like a Sora something to buy, you know.
1993928	1999231	Well, it looks like though this game is going to be more like Disney Park stuff because they show kind of in the...
1999651	2000292	Thanks for watching!
2014890	2015451	Thanks for watching!
2031104	2035765	But is it going to be dark in like a... I mean, let's face it, there's a lot of dark things at Disneyland now.
2035825	2036825	It's Halloween time there.
2036865	2038086	They have Haunted Mansion.
2038186	2042887	I guess it would... The Ghost Galaxy, if I were a little kid, would be freaked out by it.
2042947	2043987	As an adult, I think it's funny.
2044007	2046888	I think it's dark as in like, you know, the toys.
2047368	2054670	I guess, like, you know, in Toy Story, how they had the toys that the neighbor kid put together and they're all creepy looking like the baby doll head.
2055070	2057252	I can't believe Disney would allow that.
2057372	2058713	That just seems weird to me.
2068362	2072004	BlackWolf says, I do know that Square and Disney don't like each other, at least in the US.
2085910	2089252	Kitsune says, even at Tokyo Disney, nothing from Kingdom Hearts.
2089452	2091413	I guess Kitsune's been there recently.
2092773	2099276	Tigerclaw says, oh my, I would imagine during the It's a Small World level, the gamers will be tortured with that music playing on repeat.
2101000	2104123	Here's some concept art that they had for Epic Mickey.
2104523	2106085	It was kind of very steampunk-ish.
2106545	2109448	They have this ship thing with Epcot on there.
2110349	2115635	They've got some characters running around and machines and stuff.
2117196	2119839	There's Goofy right there that looks like a zombie almost.
2121941	2123822	Some like twisted, I don't even know what that is.
2125604	2126304	You know what this is?
2126664	2129486	This is like the Return to Oz of Disney.
2129766	2131828	Did anyone ever see Return to Oz when they were kids?
2131848	2132288	It was awesome.
2132368	2133749	And read the books too.
2133789	2134189	In the 80s?
2134550	2141314	Dude, okay, for those that never saw Return to Oz back in the 80s, because I was like 7 when this movie came out, which means half our listeners weren't even born.
2142715	2148419	But here's the thing is that, okay, when Return to Oz came out, first off, Feruza Balk was Dorothy.
2148479	2151281	And if you don't know who she is, she was like the twisted chick in The Craft.
2151541	2152822	I don't know what else she's been in lately.
2153102	2155484	But she was in American History X, I think, and something else.
2155764	2156464	Okay, she was Dorothy.
2156785	2160287	And like the movie started out with her in an insane asylum, right?
2160627	2164130	And she goes to this area where...
2165046	2170727	The Witch, whoever she was, the bad witch, and y'all forgive me, my details of the story are scattered, maybe Jamie can help.
2170907	2171988	She was another princess.
2172288	2172988	Oh, was she another princess?
2173008	2174508	She collected heads in jars.
2174948	2175969	Of pretty women.
2176229	2184551	Yeah, she was after Dorothy's head to get, so she was like, and you would actually see like the heads in jars and things, and like you saw all your favorite like, um...
2185171	2192675	Characters from The Wizard of Oz turned to stone and frozen in time, and it was a very dark-looking world.
2192935	2196637	And this was, I believe, a movie Disney put out, wasn't it?
2197237	2197557	Maybe.
2197677	2210824	Yeah, well, even that, though, the characters that pick up along the way, like Tick Tock, he was a different clockwork man, and he looked a bit more... But when they brought in the Scarecrow and Tin Man and all of them, they looked very...
2212349	2214529	They look like the old book.
2215210	2224232	If I remember right, this movie took so long to come out because MGM had to lose the rights to make the future Oz movies.
2224252	2226192	And I think Disney put this one out.
2226292	2229173	So it was really weird that it was kind of a darker movie.
2229633	2232653	So, you know, Disney is capable of doing darker things.
2233113	2234954	It is just surprising that it would be...
2235914	2236394	Thanks for watching!
2258448	2265593	Anyways, so yeah, really creepy shit that's in all these concept things, and so I hope they stick to it.
2265993	2268995	I mean, I hope they stick to their guns and try something risky, because you know what?
2269735	2277560	You can put out a game for Disney's Princess and the Frog, and it may sell X number of copies or whatever, and that's fine.
2277700	2278140	But you know what?
2278160	2280802	Do something ballsy, and you know what?
2281242	2282403	They'll get a good return on it.
2283837	2284458	I don't know.
2284478	2285799	Maybe a California adventure.
2285819	2285959	Maybe.
2285979	2286119	Alright.
2286139	2286260	Anyhow.
2306141	2310524	Kitsune, by the way, had never heard of Return to Oz, I guess, and is very excited about the movie.
2310564	2313706	Put the trailer in chat and says, somehow this feels like Labyrinth.
2314026	2315547	Well, it came out around that same time.
2315567	2316968	It does feel kind of like Labyrinth.
2317008	2318208	It was a lot like Labyrinth.
2318249	2324292	I mean, this was that time in the 80s when you had NeverEnding Story, Labyrinth, Dark Crystal, Return to Oz.
2324332	2326694	They all came out right around the same time.
2326854	2329876	They were all in that mid-early 80s phase, so...
2330416	2333176	The golden age of adventure movies.
2333277	2334917	Of fucking up children's minds.
2335077	2335717	Seriously.
2335817	2338017	Those are some fucked up movies we had as a kid.
2338877	2340258	Say my name!
2341538	2343478	And then you never really understood what the hell her name was.
2344819	2346419	I never got that.
2346459	2347559	They said what it was.
2349399	2350059	I used to know.
2350660	2351700	Crap, I'll have to look it up again.
2351920	2355320	I think we even tried turning on the subtitles once to find out what her goddamn name was.
2355820	2358101	And it said Untangible or something.
2359862	2360923	or Scream's name
2390025	2393027	This is a project that's known as a lot of different names according to the survey.
2393447	2398371	Game Room, Retrocade, Tower of Rom, Classics Live.
2398471	2402553	Tower of Rom is kind of awesome, although I don't see that being the actual name.
2402833	2406035	I think Retrocade or Classics Live sound a lot more realistic.
2407216	2407476	Anyhow...
2410353	2417381	They're saying that this is something that I guess looks a lot like PlayStation Home, but they're not calling it PlayStation Home.
2417701	2422666	It's just something where the 360 avatars are in there and they're kind of walking around and...
2424710	2427371	Yeah, they're playing arcade games.
2427431	2429091	That's all we really know based on the survey.
2429131	2431332	We don't know to the full extent what the interactivity is here.
2431612	2436374	But you look at one of these screenshots and you can see like two levels of video games with the avatars around.
2436734	2440595	And when I look at the titles of the games, they look like they might actually be like old school games.
2440615	2444556	Like that little graphic there, that's an Intellivision graphic.
2444916	2447337	That little guy there is from the Intellivision series.
2447677	2450958	And it looks like the name of the game there is like baseball from Intellivision.
2451138	2452059	They have Atari, yeah.
2452079	2453480	Yeah, it has the Atari logos.
2453840	2459164	So I don't know what the deal is going on here, if maybe this is like old school 80s games, Atari and Intellivision coming out, or what it is.
2459724	2461846	But could be interesting.
2462226	2465148	I don't know, what would you guys like to see in regards to retroness on the 360?
2465488	2467450	I think it'd be cool to have something like that.
2467850	2473274	Or that would be even kind of cool instead of like home, you know, just go walk around and play like arcade games.
2474915	2475155	Hmm.
2475396	2479478	Instead of, you know, watching Twilight trailers.
2479659	2479879	Right.
2481956	2488279	I gotta say though, doing this at home, going into a virtual space to launch a game, isn't that exciting?
2488460	2491721	It's one of those things that seems a lot cooler when you hear about it.
2491741	2492902	It's kind of irritating, isn't it?
2493122	2496404	Yeah, so I gotta wonder, what is gonna make this cool?
2496784	2499885	Why am I gonna wanna go into this little front end with all the little avatars?
2501966	2502807	Beer would make it cool.
2503967	2504748	Achievement points.
2505879	2506279	Oh lord.
2507280	2508280	You have found a game!
2508361	2509121	Achievement point!
2510082	2510922	You have sneezed!
2510942	2511662	Achievement point.
2512483	2513744	Sadly, you're probably right.
2513844	2515225	No, hey, I got an idea.
2516465	2529253	Well, it wouldn't really work with the classic games so much, but like, you could have, you know, say, redemption games, and you earn tickets or whatever, and you can redeem stuff for your avatar, like costumes and crap.
2530307	2533050	What if... You might be onto something here.
2533190	2545805	What if Xbox Live charged you like 10 cents to play for one play of these games that might redeem... You know, because there was other news this week, and I know Bobby talked about it on his show.
2545825	2549129	I didn't make the cut for our show, but they talked about the sports jerseys.
2550430	2551531	I know he talked about it on his show.
2551791	2556114	The sports jerseys made their way to Xbox Live this week at $4 a pop for the jerseys.
2556354	2560336	I know he was surveying his listeners tonight about would they pay for that or not.
2562497	2569821	Do you think there would be any interest in putting in $0.10, $0.25 to play a game and possibly unlock something from the game?
2570081	2571022	Do you think people would do that?
2571522	2572643	I think people would bite at that.
2573143	2574444	There are consumer whores out there.
2593883	2595264	I would try it, just to try it.
2595664	2596904	And if the game's fine, I might play it a couple times.
2596944	2609750	I think that a quarter would be... Well, I think that it should be along the lines of, oh, play this, and if you decide that you want it permanently, then you might pay for demo.
2610490	2614772	Well, either way, you know it's going to be their virtual money anyway.
2614952	2615192	Yeah.
2615952	2617533	So, alright.
2618277	2621219	Well, anyhow, it's going to be interesting to see what comes of that.
2621319	2622200	Of course, it could be nothing.
2622240	2623121	It could just be a survey.
2623301	2623701	We'll see.
2624081	2624562	DarkSakura.
2626683	2633768	Well, for other... I guess we can sort of call this nostalgic even though it's an ongoing series.
2634969	2638311	But there's the Poppin' Music Portable.
2638952	2643735	It's supposed to be coming out on PSP with the nine-button mode and everything.
2643795	2646718	But it looks like there's going to be a story mode in it.
2647858	2675350	and so because you can go around like sort of a board game map thingy like Mario Party ish and you go that way to unlock you know new songs and things but this is sort of makes me think of like you know the pop music I have pop music 7 where you play through as the little superhero guy at the end of the thing like a board game and you unlock stuff like it's sort of more like an old RPG but
2675390	2676051	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2692746	2709595	But with a controller that looks like nine pop-o-matic bubbles from the game Trouble And they're kind of laid out in a five on the bottom, four on the top pattern And you use these to play songs, like a la Guitar Hero, basically How in the hell is this going to translate to PSP?
2709975	2710195	I guess...
2710759	2712960	DJ Max is really popular on PSP and other countries.
2713441	2715902	Even here, to some extent, has a cult following here.
2715962	2717684	I guess these type of button beat games are okay.
2717764	2719365	Would this game ever come out in the U.S., though?
2733214	2733594	I don't know.
2733915	2735416	How desperate is Konami for money?
2735436	2736457	That's really the question.
2736897	2744524	You would think, though, now that it's all going digital distribution, how hard would it be for them to just slap it up on the download and let it be?
2744845	2746466	Minimal localization for that.
2746746	2748348	Right, but do you think they'll still do it?
2748408	2748868	Probably not.
2749049	2749829	No, they're leaving.
2749849	2750129	Sad.
2751651	2752171	Unfortunately.
2752472	2752712	Anyway.
2753559	2758081	Alright, well, I guess we'll see if a controller comes out for this game or not, but probably not.
2758161	2763244	But the story modes, hey, this game already sounds better than Poppin' Music Wii, and we are getting that here in America.
2763424	2766705	And it's already better than whatever Beatin' Groovy.
2767246	2768446	Oh, don't get me started.
2771568	2789581	DJ Hero will be coming out in a couple weeks and the full song list has been released by Activision and features 93 tracks with 100 different songs composing those tracks and some of the neat little things I thought I'd mention some of the tracks we have here that I thought were interesting
2791520	2792420	Um, let's see.
2792901	2798324	Of course, you may remember the remix that I did, Shout vs. Eric Pryde's Piano.
2798645	2801967	Well, there's also going to be two other Shout remixes as well.
2802007	2809713	Tears for Fears, Shout vs. DJ Shadow's Six Days, a remix featuring Mos Def, and Shout vs. Eric B. and Rakim.
2810113	2811154	Eric B. is the president.
2812034	2814236	That one is mixed by DJ Jazzy Jeff.
2814796	2816077	All completely different sounding.
2816998	2817098	Um...
2818134	2819295	Ice Ice Baby vs. Paul Abdul Straight Up
2839327	2843910	If that's not your kind of thing, there may be some Herbie Hancock Rocket.
2843950	2848013	They've got a Beat Juggle version of that and also Rocket vs. Nerds Lap Dance.
2848474	2851316	That one's produced by Grandmaster Flash.
2852256	2860463	And then Foreigner, Jukebox Hero vs. DJ Z-Trip featuring MERS, DJ Hero.
2860683	2865407	And that's, I guess, produced and mixed by DJ Z-Trip.
2866499	2869240	and then some of the songs that we'll be hearing tonight later on.
2869700	2874983	Foreigner, Jukebox Hero, only live for our live listeners during break.
2875483	2879125	Foo Fighters, Monkey Wrench vs. BC Boy Sabotage, the DJ guitar mix.
2880165	2883967	And then also, what do we got here?
2887108	2893531	Boom Boom Pow by Black Eyed Peas and Satisfaction by Benny Banassi.
2895223	2897106	and lots more stuff.
2897326	2898647	You can check out the full track list.
2898727	2899929	It's online everywhere.
2900309	2901230	Lots of good songs.
2901611	2903913	I'm very excited to play all these.
2905306	2908407	Now, we're actually going to give DJ Hero a little spin here in studio quick.
2908747	2911148	I don't think we're going to play all the songs because of copyright.
2911168	2915189	We'll just play maybe a minute or so, but just if you kind of want to hear what this game sounds like.
2915629	2919910	And it's going to be tricky because I kind of want Loki to describe, or I guess maybe I'll describe kind of what he's doing.
2920310	2924571	This is going to be weird radio, but can we plug in DJ Hero and get some of the noise out on the feed here?
2925051	2927852	And I'm going to kind of describe what Loki's doing as he's playing this game.
2929272	2930793	Where are the audio ties?
2930833	2931393	Oh, they're down there.
2931493	2931853	Are those them?
2933973	2934953	Or is that where they're... Okay.
2935733	2936334	Hold on, guys.
2936414	2937034	Live radio.
2937054	2940715	We're actually plugging in the audio for DJ Hero right now.
2942655	2945856	Can you turn it down a little bit?
2954298	2954538	Okay.
2955298	2957199	Did that take down my mics too?
2957459	2957519	Or...
2958979	2961880	Okay, sorry guys, we're adjusting the audio live here.
2962701	2963921	So, alright.
2965962	2966502	So here we go.
2966882	2968003	So Loki's going to hit start.
2970604	2971424	I don't hear anything either.
2975526	2975926	Oh, there it is.
2976066	2976627	Very quiet.
2976647	2977667	There we go.
2980905	2984227	Sorry guys, I know this isn't the most interesting radio in the world, but right now there's a menu here.
2984327	2986449	Learn to DJ, Quick Play, Single DJ.
2986469	2987250	That's what Loki picked.
2987810	2995575	And in this demo we have Marvin Gaye vs. Gorillaz, Gwen Stefani vs. Rick James, and Black Eyed Peas vs. Benny Banassi.
2996796	3019512	and you can actually see it shows you on the screen who is presenting the track it shows what's called the intensity which this is low and the duration 3 minutes and 48 seconds for the song that Loki currently has selected and then you can actually see performance on different levels I don't know if that shows how well Loki's done or what that is showing there do we have the audio?
3020193	3021834	when you're talking over it I think it's not
3027766	3028787	Is the connection bad?
3029828	3030488	There you go.
3034031	3036132	I think those wires are just weird.
3038534	3045219	Uh-oh, is there a mixing board?
3045359	3045899	That's not good.
3048861	3049422	Sorry, guys.
3053902	3057583	The reason why you're hearing it bounce from left to right, those of you listening live, our podcasts are mono.
3058743	3060623	But Loki's doing one at a time here.
3062844	3063164	Uh-oh.
3066124	3068725	We're having the board just in bad shape.
3068765	3069125	There you go.
3069665	3070245	Don't touch it.
3070725	3071145	Just play.
3076406	3077506	Did the audio already go out?
3078806	3079446	Ah, crap.
3080867	3082767	Alright, well, maybe we won't get to play it live tonight.
3083976	3084576	We will later.
3084656	3085577	You're going to fix it for later?
3086437	3088859	Alright, so we just won't get to play during the show for the podcasters.
3088899	3089699	That was a waste of time.
3090260	3090740	Sorry, guys.
3092641	3093501	Are you working on that now?
3094842	3095503	Alright, alright.
3095543	3095923	Fair enough.
3098744	3100585	I don't know what to talk about here in the meantime.
3102006	3103107	Should I just go on to the next story?
3103147	3103607	We'll come back?
3104187	3104648	Yeah, we'll do that.
3104668	3105968	I'm going to go on to the next story and we'll come back.
3108663	3110524	The next story has to do with the Wii Balance Board.
3111064	3116227	And the Wii Balance Board apparently is now being used in some airport screening.
3116727	3117908	Now, this is only a study.
3117948	3120309	It's not actually something you're going to go to the airport and see right now.
3120689	3121870	But apparently, the U.S.
3121910	3129133	government has invested some money into actually looking at using the Wii Balance Board in airport screening.
3129634	3131535	So this is according to a CNN report.
3132075	3137658	This is one of a couple of experimental methods that are being used right now to see who is suspicious at the airport.
3138638	3144000	This is being done by scientists that are part of the Future Attribute Screening Technology, or FAST program.
3144361	3148582	They're actually using the Wii Fit Peripheral to see how somebody shifts their weight.
3149203	3154465	They're trying to find, quote, a level of fidgeting that would suggest the need for a secondary screening.
3155285	3164371	So they're using the Wii balance board, I guess it's something that you would kind of step on before you go through the gate to see if you are really fidgety while you're going into the airport.
3164991	3167733	That's kind of weird to me because what if you're just old?
3169039	3170200	and you just shake a lot.
3170360	3172322	I mean, wouldn't that set off some red flags?
3173203	3178208	I don't know about you guys, but I don't think this is something you're actually going to see at an airport for quite some time.
3178749	3181772	You certainly wouldn't see a Wii balance board, that's for sure.
3182112	3188139	Would you see that type of technology embedded into a mat that you step on before you go through the terminal?
3188519	3188779	Sure.
3189219	3191660	But are you going to see the Wii balance board itself out there?
3191960	3192500	Heck no.
3192960	3193980	That's just going to look dumb.
3194280	3195520	Besides, those things are kind of thin.
3196101	3200902	And don't forget the Wii balance board only supports up to like 300 or 350 pounds.
3201342	3203882	That doesn't include everybody that you need to screen at an airport.
3204262	3211304	So, you know, if anything else, they may have to take the same technology and use it in some other new device.
3211824	3216445	Although I don't know why seeing the balance of somebody is going to show if they're a terrorist or not.
3216465	3217625	That seems a little silly to me.
3218345	3225067	I have this bad feeling that this whole thing was just a footnote on some other study that people are taking way too seriously.
3225447	3229568	Yeah, an ex-link in chat says, old person with MS sues airport.
3229728	3230448	Yeah, I could see that.
3231229	3231969	I could see that happening.
3232989	3233629	How we doing, Loki?
3234510	3235830	We okay?
3236050	3237650	Loki's got some new plugs he's gonna try.
3237670	3241252	Like I said, I wanted to try this the first time.
3242012	3243732	This is the way he wanted to do it the first time, I guess.
3244352	3245393	Of course, I'm not hearing anything.
3246173	3246273	Oh.
3252337	3253997	Those plugs there are bad.
3257638	3260959	Do you have another red and white set you can use besides those plugs?
3265580	3267600	Only on live radio could this happen, boys and girls.
3267820	3268661	What about the gray cords?
3268761	3271101	There's gray cords in the box that we used to use.
3272542	3273802	Those will extend.
3278584	3285068	Okay, we're trying to right now extend... Will that even work?
3285809	3286589	Okay, he says yes.
3289952	3291473	And hopefully these plugs will be a little better.
3292994	3294355	And that's what Loki is putting in right now.
3295275	3299758	As we try to demo DJ Hero for you guys here on Orange On Radio.
3299858	3300559	Much better!
3300819	3301640	Alright!
3301740	3302180	Okay.
3302300	3302520	Okay.
3308942	3309903	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft
3341570	3343030	Alright, so the song is currently loading.
3344891	3345931	And there's a tip on the screen.
3345991	3348471	Rewinds are a great way to earn a big score.
3348851	3350351	Try them in a section you know well.
3351392	3353452	And it's showing him a little bit about how to play the game.
3353472	3356172	There's a euphoria button, an effects dial.
3356813	3358613	Alright, so this is Marvin Gaye versus Gorillaz.
3360253	3362073	He's laying down the track.
3363774	3364374	Here we go.
3366994	3370775	And right now he's hitting buttons on the controller in time with the beats as they fall.
3378379	3382641	But he's also moving the crossfader back and forth as you see it on the green and the blue sides.
3382881	3386823	I don't know if he's holding the button down when he does that.
3386843	3391866	But when he sees these little arrows on the track, he actually has to be scratching.
3407287	3409028	I want this remix, like, really bad.
3409608	3413530	And Loki's actually having to hold down the green or the blue button when he scratches.
3413550	3417212	Because they're scratching on both the green and the blue track.
3417552	3426877	Watch me as I grab it.
3427097	3431519	Watch me as I... Close down this... Showdown you... Can't fight with us.
3431539	3432539	Showdown you... So...
3440046	3442228	What was that in the middle?
3442368	3443048	Oh, freestyle?
3443088	3452075	He just blared a horn.
3452115	3452836	Very interesting.
3452856	3454657	Alright, I don't know if we can play much more here.
3454998	3457139	I'm gonna catch off Loki.
3457179	3459361	Can you just pause it?
3459441	3460342	Or fail it, or whatever?
3461903	3462363	Alright, there he is.
3462403	3463204	He's going to pause it there.
3463604	3466105	You will get to hear the whole thing of that on break later.
3466825	3470526	But unfortunately for the podcast, we have to cut it off because we don't want to get sued by the makers of DJ Hero.
3470866	3474968	So we used a little bit there for critical review purposes only, as we're allowed to do.
3475528	3477309	So, there you go.
3478209	3478650	Interesting.
3479510	3480890	Yeah, it is a bummer we don't have TV.
3481131	3485452	I don't know what exciting radio that made, but at least I was able to get a feel for the game.
3485872	3486773	Now I kind of want to play.
3486793	3487873	Yeah, it looks like fun.
3487893	3488954	I'll have to play later.
3488974	3489694	Alright.
3489734	3490014	Alright.
3490580	3494562	Anyhow, we'll get into more DJ Hero here in a little bit, but we have some more news.
3494942	3496503	DarkSakura's going to take us to our next story.
3497184	3497704	I am.
3498164	3499145	Well, I guess I am.
3500185	3511171	For fans of Beatles Rock Band, there is an actual download content plan in store, but it's based on how well the next three sets of download content go.
3514113	3526820	They, um... Because the process for doing everything for Beatles Rock Band is expensive and intensive because it's not just like, you know, mastering one song in.
3527420	3543089	You have to send off the original tape and redo it and bring it back in and have level animation and whatnot ready for it because it has to fit in with their whole, I guess, branding or whatever, the feel of the game.
3544229	3545831	It has to fit the identity of the game.
3546831	3550934	So they want to see how everything sells first.
3551915	3554757	Right now, of course, the only downloadable content is All You Need Is Love.
3557097	3568846	but on October 20th we're getting Abbey Road which will be 1360 Microsoft points or 160 points per track and then we get Sgt.
3568886	3584058	Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band and Rubber Soul which Rubber Soul is my favorite just saying great album I had it on vinyl and of course those are coming out in November and December respectively
3584958	3607115	So, I think it makes sense, you know, because it is really a lot of work to go, that goes into it, not just, you know, for having to master the tracks, but like I said, you've got to make sure that the animations lined up, that, you know, everything is going to fit the feel of the rest of the game, which is why you can't, you know, go in and play Aerosmith on Beatles Rock Band or something like that.
3607936	3609337	You know, even though that would be kind of fun.
3609577	3610698	That would be in Guitar Hero.
3611158	3613240	Yeah, well, you know what I mean, as an example.
3613973	3618595	Well, you know, you can't expect that there's going to be new content every week for the Beatles rock band.
3618615	3621396	I mean, obviously, there's a very limited catalog to what they can pick from.
3621856	3623896	And, of course, you know, you're talking about old music.
3624197	3632460	You're talking about very protected, very delicate, you know, world icon music that, you know, has got to be scrutinized very carefully.
3632840	3636341	It makes sense why this is not going to be a floodgate worth of material.
3636381	3638882	And, honestly, you know, if the game enough...
3639762	3645405	I don't think the download content is going to give you anything that's going to make you go OMG must buy this game.
3645725	3647606	If the game enough wasn't good enough, forget it.
3648147	3651108	But it would be nice to see them pour some more stuff out here.
3651489	3658913	My thought on this is that there are actually a number of songs in the home game that are just a few that I'm really not familiar with.
3660013	3670559	and certain songs in different eras are ones that are not on my list of favorites I like a lot of the mid to older stuff better
3671823	3676347	But isn't it like maybe exposing you to stuff you haven't heard from a band that is so iconic?
3676367	3677287	I'll put it this way.
3677507	3681911	I've at least heard most of the songs in the game once at least.
3683452	3687996	But I don't really look at it as being a new kind of exposure.
3688236	3691118	It's just that I would rather have some of my favorites.
3693160	3698984	Although I wonder how they're doing some of the ones that didn't have a drum track or didn't have a...
3700425	3722588	any guitar there's like for example Eleanor Rigby only had strings so maybe you put your guitar up to your neck and play like it's a violin I'm joking of course you just probably play sort of like a let's talk more rock instead of keytar you have you know violin rock
3723934	3724474	Vanessa May
3743439	3745421	NBA 2K10 is coming out on PC.
3745441	3747042	I guess it got delayed from the rest of them.
3747703	3750225	Cars, Racerama, pretty much coming out on everything.
3752127	3754209	Squeeball's Party on the Wii and DS.
3754229	3758413	You may remember this was the game that was supposed to have a Wii remote type of controller for the Xbox 360.
3759514	3761135	That version got cancelled, unfortunately.
3761976	3763417	But you can pick it up on the rest of the systems.
3764398	3770840	Also, the kind of a Grey's Hits edition of Midnight Club Los Angeles is coming out.
3770880	3775682	The complete edition with the download content intact and for the Grey's Hits price.
3776562	3778923	Pets Pony Beauty Pageant for the DS.
3780424	3783705	SingStar Latino coming out on PlayStation 2.
3784265	3784885	That's interesting.
3784905	3785886	Didn't know that was coming over here.
3786846	3790167	Ju-On, The Grudge, Haunted House Simulator for the Wii.
3791108	3791928	Making its way out this week.
3794064	3800895	Africa on PS3, which apparently has been getting horrible reviews.
3800915	3804040	It's about time that game comes out, though.
3804581	3806424	How long have we been waiting for that?
3808819	3811522	Where the Wild Things Are, coming out, tying in with the new movie.
3812323	3815767	And that'll be on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Wii, and DS.
3816587	3818109	Maybe PSP.
3818149	3821112	Magna Carta 2, coming out on Xbox 360.
3822594	3824896	SingStar Motown, coming out on PlayStation 3.
3825397	3826678	Also another game I was unaware of.
3827479	3828960	Hero Saga, Leviathan...
3829761	3849577	Elevathan Tactics coming out on DS Mario and Sonic at the Olympic Winter Games on the Wii and DS this week Brutal Legend making its way out on Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 kind of go along with epic games like that Uncharted 2 Among Thieves coming out this week on PlayStation 3
3850831	3853453	Half Minute Hero coming out on PlayStation Portable.
3853873	3854734	That'll be pretty awesome.
3854754	3861179	If you haven't bought Fallout 3 yet, Fallout 3 Game of the Year Edition with all the download content with it for $60.
3861419	3865102	That's coming out on Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, and PC.
3865703	3868865	Way of the Samurai on Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 this week.
3869546	3873068	Grand Theft Auto Chinatown Wars on PSP.
3874710	3877091	Sudoku Ball Detective on the Wii.
3878197	3884765	Buck Fever on the Wii, and a boy and his blob on the Wii.
3885265	3885906	That's going to be awesome.
3885946	3886326	Really?
3886447	3886787	Yeah.
3887167	3888889	Boy, that came out of the radar, didn't it?
3889250	3891412	I actually saw something for that a little earlier today.
3891793	3895897	I thought I'd seen something on one of the blogs, but I got the impression this game was still in development.
3895917	3896979	I didn't realize it was coming out now.
3898420	3899581	It's ready to go.
3899802	3900242	Interesting.
3900643	3904887	Agatha Christie's ABC Murders coming out on DS this week.
3905347	3905788	Woohoo.
3906048	3906309	Yeah.
3906989	3910313	I hope Angela Lansbury does some voice acting in that.
3910333	3911033	I'm a big fan.
3912315	3913056	And that's it.
3913576	3916338	Alright, Japanese release dates are not here this week.
3916358	3917779	We'll get back to those next week.
3917839	3923423	So apologies to those folks looking for the releases in Japan, but my resource is not working right now.
3923503	3925544	So we'll have to just skip over to Euro release dates, right?
3926465	3940414	What we have is Brutal Legend on the 16th for PS3 and Xbox 360, Harvest Fishing, yay, Magna Carta 2, Mario & Luigi Bowser's Inside Story, which actually that sounds pretty fun to me.
3941675	3942435	Playing as a...
3943796	3944657	Big ol' lizard guy.
3945037	3946258	You're playing inside of him.
3946298	3947678	Yeah.
3947939	3949319	The nose and rump command.
3950020	3950680	That sounds funny.
3952221	3955643	Mario and Sonic at the Olympic Winter Games on the 16th.
3956624	3961367	And Ninja Captains, as well as Tropico 3.
3962767	3964909	Oh, and also Uncharted 2 Among Thieves.
3967470	3968131	That'd be all.
3968411	3968631	Arrgh.
3970709	3971209	Uncharted Uncharted
3997355	4004060	Okay, so you may not be having trouble with your vision, but hey, who says that you can't improve upon what you already have?
4004661	4008944	And apparently a company that makes gaming glasses is looking to do that.
4009284	4014528	The new glasses are called Gunner Optics, and they're designed to improve your gaming performance.
4015008	4026057	Apparently they have some special coating and tints to them, and apparently they do everything from reducing glare to blocking out evaporative air currents.
4027489	4033353	Okay, basically to me they look like shooting glasses, but just with a fancier frame.
4033513	4035114	They kind of have that same yellow tint to them.
4035594	4042618	The prices are $100, and apparently Ars Technica took them out for a test drive and actually found out that they do what they say.
4042678	4046501	They actually did have an effect during prolonged gaming sessions.
4047721	4052484	Whether that's worth the $100 or not is, I guess, your decision, but they look neat.
4053365	4054766	You know, I guess a little bit geek-chic.
4056277	4056597	I don't know.
4057017	4059379	Maybe if I... I don't know, I might look good in glasses.
4060639	4062280	I'm not going to drop $100 on glasses, though.
4062640	4063341	Let me see these.
4064221	4069424	Well, you know, a good pair of regular glasses will cost you several hundred dollars, so... Mine cost $430.
4069544	4080490	I mean, that's why people have vision insurance, but... And if it's just yellow tint, I have yellow tinted glasses I bought for $10 that are basically this same thing, except without the fancy frame.
4081291	4081791	And, you know...
4082813	4088578	Maybe I should try those, except I don't like running around with those because... Well, didn't some big website put this on a study and vouch for it?
4088718	4091481	I mean, so there's got to be something more there, Loki.
4091521	4096285	I don't think this is something you can just get the tinted lenses at the 98 cent clearance center and run with, you know?
4096625	4099528	Well, not necessarily those, but like, you know, shooting glasses.
4099588	4106895	I use them for... Well, I bought them for airsofting, but they're dangerous to wear airsofting because, you know, it...
4107515	4108215	Thanks for watching!
4128717	4137863	Well, according to TigerClaw in our chatroom, chat.orange.com, apparently Dead Pixel Live, another show here on allgames.com, had an interview with the folks that made these glasses.
4137943	4143207	And Derek H. just wants to say they do put magic stuff in them to make them work.
4143287	4146389	And I'm assuming you won't be able to find the magic stuff in your $10 frames.
4146569	4148551	So there's something special in there.
4148571	4149532	It's called crack.
4152675	4155841	and Bochikawa also wears yellow tinted plastic for Airsoft.
4156843	4157404	Alright, anyhow.
4158606	4163095	Moving on to one more game news story here and then we're getting into the classic game of the week.
4165157	4166458	PSP Minis
4183393	4195931	$2,500 so you might see a game here on a PSP that you see on the iPhone as well and it costs more on the PSP and the whole reason why is the ESRB and something I didn't think of before is that the ESRB
4196972	4200994	You don't have to get a rating from that for the iPhone game, surprisingly enough.
4201555	4204316	Isn't that something you think that's going to come to a head later on?
4204776	4208058	Isn't that just a bag of uh-oh waiting to be opened?
4208078	4214121	No, not really, because if you think about it, they kind of go through their own review process through Apple.
4214241	4221846	And really, it's Apple as a platform that determines whether they want to put games on their platform that have an ESRB rating or not.
4222346	4226308	And if they say, yeah, we'll take whatever, even if it doesn't have a rating or not,
4226608	4227409	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4249022	4249662	The hell with you.
4250402	4252203	Interesting point from Xlink in chat.
4252303	4253784	Kids don't have an iPhone.
4253844	4254524	Adults do.
4255244	4256805	But what about... I know kids with iPhones.
4257225	4257325	Yeah.
4257345	4258525	What the hell are you talking about?
4258545	4259746	What about an iTouch, too?
4259866	4262587	I mean, he makes a good point, but an iTouch, you don't have to have a phone contract for.
4262607	4263467	That sounds dirty, Rob.
4263487	4264227	Well, that's true, though.
4264287	4265147	The apps are for the iTouch, too.
4265207	4266068	It's an iPod Touch.
4267088	4270909	At least they don't have a kid's version called iTouch Kids, because that would be bad.
4271290	4272370	Fine, iPod Touch.
4272410	4273530	Sorry, I thought it was an iTouch.
4273570	4273910	Whatever.
4274411	4274791	Shut up.
4276571	4276851	All right.
4276871	4278192	I gotta do a story.
4279352	4279853	Yes, I know.
4280313	4280734	What's that?
4280914	4281615	Down the line.
4281995	4282856	I can't shut up yet.
4283858	4286261	No.
4286681	4286961	All right.
4287322	4295873	Anyhow, I just wanted to say, though, real quick, that if you wonder why the PSP minis are more expensive, that is something the developers are citing as kind of their excuse, for lack of a better term.
4296133	4297134	So there you go.
4298072	4301975	Alright, we're going to get into another segment we like to do here on Orange Lounge Radio.
4302115	4304737	Every week is kind of our Part B segment, so to speak.
4305357	4312882	And it's a part where DarkSakura gets to climb through her gaming vault and find a game that, you know what, she thinks you guys ought to be playing.
4313242	4316705	And it's a segment we like to call the Classic Video Game of the Week.
4320629	4321630	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4344324	4346066	I'm not doing anything extra internet-y.
4346126	4346566	We may not.
4346586	4346826	There we go.
4371775	4373517	I just picked random level music.
4374457	4385347	Anyway, Super Mario RPG is an adventure and role-playing game that's put out by Square back in the day and Nintendo.
4386068	4388330	It came out in Japan on March 9, 1996 and on May 13, 1996 in North America.
4388370	4389531	Europe did not get it.
4394535	4407626	Not until it came out on the Virtual Console, August 22, 2008, which, according to this reference, is the longest difference in time between release dates in Nintendo's history.
4408868	4410149	So... I had to change the YouTube.
4410169	4411370	Sorry, the other one wasn't loading right.
4411390	4412050	So, here we go.
4412150	4414653	Oh, okay.
4414673	4414833	Okay.
4416633	4426480	Anyway, this was made pretty much all in-house by Square, with guidance from Miyamoto.
4427220	4427861	So, big deal.
4429442	4432143	The battle system in this game was pretty cool.
4432904	4444211	It's very similar to Chrono Trigger, so that it's action-based, but you don't necessarily just stick in your monster battles.
4444252	4446253	It does play rather isometrically.
4447173	4475940	um and you can see your enemies and you can't you know you don't fight with one until you run into one so that's what I mean by Chrono Trigger like you know but with your battle system you can play Mario, Mallow, Geno, Bowser or Princess Toadstool and they all of course have their own attacks and it is turn based um this traditional turn based system um but you do have timed button presses um
4477824	4481611	And of course you have items and stuff.
4490103	4512084	But yeah, with the game, you go visit all the Toad people, and you have Moleville, and a monster town, and you have the Yoshi town, and you have the cloud place called Nimbus Land, where the cloud people live, and Bowser's Castle, and all this other crazy stuff.
4512805	4514466	But you...
4515447	4518868	Play, um, but yeah, there are some original characters on there.
4518908	4522610	I mean, not just, you know, Mario and Toadstool and Bowser who came from the other games.
4523690	4530693	Um, but you have, um, Mallow who is a cloud boy who thinks he's a tadpole.
4531854	4534875	And Geno who is, uh...
4536118	4560906	Possessed by a creature from the Star Road And then, of course, Bowser and his little friends So that's the game Pretty cool It's got its own fun look and its own fun music And also, though, this is... I've mentioned this before, but it's one of the only three games That came outside of Japan that used the Nintendo SA-1
4562667	4584504	The others being Kirby Superstar and Kirby's Dream Land 3 So basically, and this was another microprocessor But it allowed a higher clock speed, faster RAM, greater memory mapping Data storage, compression, new DMA modes such as bitmap to bitplane And built-in CIC lockout, so pretty cool
4588579	4594828	Oh yeah, it had different sound effects that used the SBC-700.
4594988	4596971	That was pretty cool.
4596991	4599935	This game was really advanced for when it came out.
4601637	4601978	Alright.
4602916	4604477	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4625452	4626373	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
4651150	4653412	and Rock Band coming to the iPhone.
4653432	4654793	We talked a little bit about iPhone games.
4655234	4659257	Now a big, big title is coming its way to the iPhone.
4659577	4663601	So we'll be kind of talking about if folks are looking forward to that or if this just sounds like shit.
4663961	4668945	We'll talk about that all in a little bit when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
4669105	4669726	So stay tuned.
4675655	4703762	And welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio Live on this October 11th, 2009 Here for episode number 340 of our weekly podcast Which we've taped since June of 2002 During the break there, something I don't think we've done in quite some time in the history of our show Loki actually played a game live and provided us all of the break music tonight And we played some DJ Hero I am so sorry to the podcast listeners, but due to copyright restrictions
4704082	4717270	We can't play any more than we did in Part A for you guys, although I hear guys in our chatroom were bootlegging that, and we don't condone that, but if you know who to talk to, there's really nothing we can do about it if some of those bootlegs get out, so there you go.
4717710	4723494	But I posted a question in the chat, what you guys thought of that, and we were talking here in the studio, the soundtrack's really hot.
4723574	4728137	That third song, especially the Satisfaction vs. Boom Boom Pow, you know, I'm...
4728977	4730158	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4747924	4749565	Just a part of the soundtrack.
4749625	4751046	You were actually rewinding.
4751327	4753048	You were doing the freestyle horns, right?
4753088	4760453	Freestyle, and then also there's parts where you can distort it, and I was using the effector dial on there to distort some of the tracks in there, too.
4760773	4765757	So there's a lot of stuff that you can kind of add on top of it, and actually there's a port in there where you can add a microphone, too.
4765777	4771321	I think a headset microphone if you want to talk over stuff, but that's tough enough.
4771361	4774043	But yeah, I did screw up a few spots where it dropped out.
4774383	4775484	It's really touchy.
4775544	4776505	It's sensitive to where...
4777446	4783941	I end the scratches too early sometimes, but it's fun, and we'll have to definitely do it again once we get the full game.
4784901	4790403	Now Bobby does want me to say in chat, obviously all games radio would prefer no bootlegs be released as we could be held liable.
4790423	4793404	Just saying, yeah, so obviously I was kidding before.
4793744	4797445	So don't release bootlegs because we don't want the fine folks to host our show here.
4797525	4801606	A lot of these songs I think are already out there in numerous gameplay clips.
4801666	4810709	I was commenting that I think that the Hollaback Boy, Girl, Wooden, whatever, that I have a very similar mashup on a disc that I bought in Berklee.
4811627	4825260	and honestly this is all just promotion for Activision anyway because honestly if I wasn't sold on this game already I am fucking buying this day one now so and I think a lot of folks in chat that were skeptical about the soundtrack have probably you know for the most part been overwhelmingly approved so
4825782	4832247	We've done a good thing for Activision here, but still, for legal reasons, yeah, we said what we said.
4832688	4834689	So, let's see, what else?
4834889	4836931	Yeah, DJ Dark Knight says, don't copy that floppy.
4837432	4838352	But back to the songs.
4839914	4840434	Let's see.
4841575	4847520	Cheeseburger does say, sorry, but I hate those songs, except for the synth in Satisfaction, which is a part of the original song anyway.
4848360	4853365	Well, they have a lot of stuff, like there's some hip-hop songs in there that I'm not going to be too excited to play, but...
4853945	4854666	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4881491	4883832	and reading some of your Twitter topics for tonight.
4884412	4889173	And there's a lot of DJ Hero talk on our Twitter feed right now, but we do have some questions.
4890213	4892133	Let's get to some quick Twitter topics tonight.
4892213	4896254	Ryan Belknap on Twitter at twitter.com slash OLR.
4896274	4897434	Uh-oh, I have the hiccups.
4897514	4898395	Worst thing in radio to have.
4899355	4903676	Excuse me, wants to know, what do you think about all of the games that were pushed back over the last month?
4903716	4904796	Will they be worth the wait?
4906690	4915875	There's a lot that I was waiting for to come out that have been pushed back, like Red Dead Redemption, which I'm very excited to play because it's Grand Theft Auto and the Wild West.
4916355	4925320	Then also, I'm trying to think what other stuff I was waiting for that are... I don't know, I'm kind of glad a lot of it's been pushed back because I don't have the money to buy all these right now.
4925900	4929062	I'll be picking up Borderlands probably in two weeks.
4929222	4932544	I'll be picking up DJ Hero hopefully earlier than that.
4934858	4935579	DJ Hero, Borderlands
4959906	4961808	DJ Hero is gonna be really cool and there's still some stuff coming out
4984890	4987131	and some of the games I bought already are really taking my time.
4988231	4993112	GamerGirl on Twitter wants to know, what's anyone's favorite video game soundtrack?
4993412	4994412	Favorite video game soundtrack?
4995293	4998253	Beatmania 2DX 5th Style is one of my favorite.
4999074	5003075	I can't really think about the dancing games, the music games, considering.
5003755	5011777	So I'm going to say that as far as a soundtrack that I can just sit and listen to over and over again, probably Klonoa.
5013018	5034311	hmm okay chrono or chrono trigger good choice i would i i'm gonna be just total uh stereotypical and go with the final fantasy series just because the final you know especially series like final fantasy 11 you know you do listen to that music so often when you play those games that it has to have good music so i would say a game like final fantasy 11 or probably my favorite soundtrack in the entire series was six final fantasy six
5034491	5039156	I'd have to go with six, although the spinoff soundtracks were pretty good.
5039416	5043640	Like Final Fantasy Prey and Celtic Moon, both fantastic.
5044020	5044941	Loki, any favorites for you?
5049866	5050226	I don't know.
5050326	5055071	I'd say maybe DDR5th or Max 2 would probably be my favorite soundtracks.
5057153	5057994	Katamari's pretty good.
5060213	5088654	Spazinator has two quick topics for us your video game related pet peeves mine would be arcades replacing arcade machines with redemption machines that's a pet peeve of mine I mean I understand why it's happening but it's still a pet peeve mine are programmed in quarter drainers for arcades for console it would be you know I really don't know probably bad voice acting
5090474	5093316	My other pet peeve would be Xbox Live Griefers.
5093356	5098299	Just the people on there and go, you know, NNNFFF, you know what I mean.
5099259	5105042	Fixing stuff that doesn't need to be fixed or just not adding features that should be completely simple to add.
5105082	5107183	For example, Grand Theft Auto 4.
5108104	5114768	The multiplayer, you can set your time limits for 5, 10, 15 minutes, 20 minutes, 30 minutes.
5117611	5118993	And then it jumps to 45 minutes.
5119373	5121655	If you want to play a 35 minute game, you have to play two games.
5122016	5122556	And it's annoying.
5122696	5126521	Like, because Saints Row, you can play anything from a 1 minute long game to a 60 minute game.
5126561	5128563	And it's just set at any amount of time in between.
5128643	5129884	And I don't understand why they have to take that out.
5130305	5133928	Or, when they updated for Lost and Damned, let's remove the helicopters out of free mode.
5134169	5135110	Yeah, that's an awesome idea.
5135290	5136151	Why the hell did you do that?
5136411	5136671	It's just...
5137372	5137892	There's no point.
5138493	5144455	We'll let Spazinator have a second question here on Twitter Topics tonight because he managed to fit two questions in 140 characters, so we'll let him do it.
5145135	5148397	What each console and their respective services can do to improve?
5148797	5150658	What could each console do to improve?
5150798	5151778	Anyone want to tackle this first?
5153619	5155480	What can each console do to improve?
5155520	5156440	Yeah, what could the Wii do?
5156460	5157421	What could the 360 do?
5157461	5158281	What could the PS3 do?
5158821	5162203	Well, the Wii, first of all, could have online play.
5163672	5168336	The Xbox 360 can, I don't know, they're pretty damn awesome.
5169857	5170798	I guess have better filters.
5171899	5174261	And the PS3 can be a different system.
5176963	5177183	Loki?
5178618	5188744	The Wii needs an actual online something other than just browsing a Flash, not even a Flash, like a JavaScript store for games and stuff.
5188764	5192726	They need something more substantial like the PlayStation Network and Xbox Live.
5193067	5203493	The PlayStation Network needs more download content on there as far as game releases and stuff like that because Xbox Live has at least one or two new games coming out each week.
5204414	5204654	XBOX Live
5222506	5223147	Point Conversion Crap
5239653	5242535	I definitely have the definitive answers in my opinion for these three consoles.
5242615	5245457	The Wii needs to embrace online, period.
5245557	5250241	Nintendo needs to stop being afraid of online and see how it can work for them in large doses.
5251041	5253783	But I honestly don't think the Wii can be remedied in its current state.
5253803	5254704	I think it is what it is.
5254764	5256285	I think it's been pigeonholed for what it is.
5256625	5257986	It's not necessarily a bad thing.
5258046	5262369	It is the number one console in America right now, whether we like it or not as hardcore gamers.
5263309	5268853	But I would say if they want to woo the hardcore gamers back, they're going to need to fix some things with Wii HD, which we all know is inevitable.
5269914	5297488	PlayStation 3 I couldn't disagree with DarkSakura more I think they did exactly what they needed to do this year and that was drop the price to a reasonable point and I think they're on a path for success right now I think the PS3's been doing a lot right this year PSP Go, completely different story PS3, I think is a console I would recommend to friends this Christmas, the biggest thing they could do now focus on working, selling those consoles and getting more exclusives would be the biggest thing they could do right now
5297981	5299702	Yeah, my PS3 is a Blu-ray player.
5301482	5307344	See, now I can't say that because especially now that my 360's been broken, I've been able to value the PlayStation more.
5307744	5313446	Now, tell me, when your Xbox 360 is fixed, is that going to change?
5314167	5317528	Are you going to immediately remember everything that you liked better about the Xbox 360?
5318188	5320510	It'll be about half and half because here's my thing for the 360.
5321291	5329820	And yes, there will be games that I will buy on the PlayStation 3 over the 360 because this 360 lacks hardcore in this one place.
5330300	5331942	And what the 360 needs to fix?
5332542	5332883	Anyone?
5333902	5336464	DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
5353721	5360842	Why else do you think that I like the Saturn Dual Analog Control, even though that one seemed kind of, you know, on the unwieldy side when you look at it?
5360982	5366504	It actually, everything, like, I was playing through just a number of games and having zero problem.
5366524	5368984	Like, well, Dan had problems with Mr. Driller, I didn't.
5369644	5376766	I mean, it may just be I've got, you know, smaller hands than both of you guys, but I don't really have much of a problem with playing games on the Xbox 360.
5376826	5376866	Um...
5378846	5390634	I actually hate a lot of the PS3 games just because, I mean, first of all, they'll rely on different visual effects that the Xbox 360 just doesn't need.
5391094	5405464	And also, in comparison, there's certain games that are coming out, namely Bayonetta, that is going to be complete and utter crap on PS3 as opposed to Xbox 360, both in terms of graphics, processor speed, how the game functions on the system.
5406444	5412529	Um, so, honestly, I think that the Xbox 360 controller to me is more comfortable in my hands.
5412989	5428420	That's why I got this on Xbox 360, as in Marvel Ultimate Alliance 2, instead of PlayStation 3, which I've played the first one on both systems, and to this day, the control is infinitely better on the Xbox 360.
5429298	5436681	Just playing Mega Man 9 on the 360 controller and playing it on a PS3 controller made me want to just build my own 360 controller.
5437202	5438863	I just cannot play some games on 360.
5439283	5440123	I'm not hating on Microsoft.
5440143	5440964	They do a lot right.
5441344	5446106	I mean, to be fair, if I'm picking on that, 360's done a lot of brilliant things this year.
5446306	5447547	1 vs. 100 was awesome.
5447787	5450448	They continue to lead the charge in online gaming.
5450808	5454490	But if I could fix something, that would be the first place to start is a new controller.
5454949	5457350	Well, third parties make other controllers, I think.
5457391	5458891	Doesn't Hori make one as well?
5459352	5462153	I don't think any of them really just radically change the design, though.
5464095	5464215	So.
5465313	5465593	Anyhow.
5466293	5468934	And, you know, you have a fan in Brad from PodCulture.
5468974	5472575	He says he prefers the 360 controller over the PS3 any day.
5473035	5473255	Yeah.
5473796	5474996	How about the noise of the system?
5475016	5476296	That would be the other thing I'd want to fix.
5476596	5481858	Is that when I am trying to watch Netflix or movies on the 360, it sounds like mom's running the vacuum cleaner behind me.
5482158	5482738	I don't notice.
5483118	5483458	Really?
5483959	5485919	Well, keep in mind how my setup is.
5487059	5491641	I have everything together under the drawer on there, so really...
5492481	5493362	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5522060	5523441	Alright, one more question here.
5523961	5528424	Sertour from our Twitter wants to know, are PSP minigames too expensive?
5528844	5532846	Are the regular PSN download games too expensive in comparison to the UMD prices?
5533286	5534267	Yes and yes.
5535308	5536308	That's his opinion.
5536808	5540470	For me, I can't answer this and I doubt the others can too.
5540550	5541991	I haven't played a PSP minigame yet.
5542011	5542992	I haven't paid to download one.
5543392	5545053	I couldn't tell you if they're worth the money or not.
5545333	5546414	I don't know.
5546734	5548235	I keep forgetting they exist.
5548895	5549976	I do think people...
5551857	5554880	Forget what $5 or $10 is supposed to get you.
5555480	5560345	And honestly, I think $10 is not that much money for a video game.
5561125	5574097	And, you know, considering that most games now cost $60 used, I think most of these arcade games, I mean, this goes for Xbox Live and the minis and what have you, $10 for a game is not unreasonable, especially if the game's good.
5574117	5574877	Yeah.
5575878	5578639	I haven't played any PSP minigames, so I couldn't tell you.
5578979	5584281	As far as the regular PSN download games too expensive in comparison to UMD prices, you know what?
5584401	5593344	I'm all for the PSN download thing for convenience, but I'm also all for competition, and this is why I do not like the PSP Go, and I don't really care for where it's...
5594564	5598367	I don't like the fact that there's only one source to buy the games.
5598787	5603450	And it is something I haven't given a lot of thought to until the system was released.
5603850	5606212	But competition is usually a pretty healthy thing.
5606792	5621282	And if this digital distribution thing keeps going and online is the only place we're able to buy games, that is through Sony or through Microsoft in the future if they do something similar, that's going to be a little worrisome.
5621702	5624024	Because competition right now is what keeps things awesome.
5624784	5629467	What's a website like CheapAssGamer going to do if all the consoles go digital distribution?
5631408	5634009	There's always going to be older stuff that's out there.
5635050	5637151	And I don't think it's ever going to go away completely.
5638392	5640793	Because GameStop's not going to let it go away completely.
5641914	5646696	And despite every nice thing I said about PlayStation 3 earlier, I still think the PSP Go is a big joke.
5646956	5648697	And if you want to get a PSP, get a PSP 3000.
5650802	5666799	and I would recommend a PSP3000 but I would not recommend a PSPGO alright that's enough for Twitter topics we talked a lot about those Twitter topics let's move on with some rapid fire news tonight on Orange Lounge Radio Loki, start us off with some quick news
5667150	5668510	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5690197	5690777	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
5712363	5716148	Almost like a plot to, say, The Wizard or something like that.
5716429	5720454	He's getting better at this one game in order to fight somebody.
5722557	5723077	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
5743174	5746476	DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
5765310	5765890	Thanks for watching!
5790660	5792721	DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
5812811	5821477	Some other individual songs coming out for the bands Black Tide, Joe Satriani, Kansas, L7, and Blink-182 with What's My Age Again.
5821837	5823878	That was one of the videos you would see on MTV all the time.
5823898	5825599	I bet L7's is Pretend That We're Dead.
5826159	5826900	That's already in the game.
5827260	5831523	And well then the other... And Andres is the song that's coming.
5831903	5832383	So there it is.
5834795	5840816	In other news, Jordan Mechner has filed a trademark for Prince of Persia, The Forgotten Sands.
5840936	5844057	Of course, Jordan Mechner is the creator of the Prince of Persia series after all.
5844477	5851138	So that may be something where... I don't know if that's something where the new Prince of Persia series is headed.
5851438	5853478	That also might tie in with the movie, too.
5853518	5856859	That is very true, is that it could be a sequel to the movie that's coming out next year.
5857059	5862740	I think Sands of Time is what it's based on, so it sounds like it could be a tie-in movie or...
5863300	5864021	and DarkSakura.com.
5883280	5887704	Xbox Live, PlayStation Network, and Steam will be seeing this game in 2010.
5887924	5893589	This is coming from Konami, has made this game.
5893649	5896931	It's going to be on Xbox Live Arcade and all that good stuff in early 2010.
5897632	5898673	It is not a remake.
5898773	5904217	It is a sequel 15 years after the last Rocket.
5904437	5905238	It looks pretty sweet, too.
5905258	5907160	Have you seen the screenshots or trailer yet?
5907220	5909562	I've just seen one screenshot, but I haven't seen the trailer.
5910422	5910782	DarkSakura
5928860	5938725	Well, for news of Halo 3 ODST, they actually made up... Sorry, I'm getting dinged.
5939826	5940346	My apologies.
5941567	5942707	Actually are getting...
5944348	5948750	Hit a 27 million games sold, which is pretty good.
5949591	5953632	I'm sorry, that's total Halo games sold is up to 27 million.
5953753	5960195	Actually, for ODST, 2.5 million copies have been sold within the last two weeks.
5961736	5964738	Also, there's to be a little bit more for it.
5964778	5971901	That means that we're going to be potentially seeing Master Chief come out in one of the future expansions.
5973369	5990662	and they also know that there were a few cliffhangers that need to be resolved but they're saying that they have a plan that's going out at least six years and it actually is going to tie in all the canon including comic books and novels that sounds ambitious
5992239	5995660	Also for Marvel Ultimate Alliance 2, they're getting Carnage.
5996981	6011346	And Carnage is, well, as everyone hopes, not just another Spider-Man and not just another Venom, but full-on, psycho, crazy, honorless, vicious... Did I say crazy?
6011366	6012286	Because I mean crazy.
6012406	6013787	Carnage is fucking nuts.
6014867	6016188	So yeah, be getting Carnage.
6018589	6044604	and then Activision filed a particular trademark for a particular adaptation of a particular game to be made into a movie and that would be Call of Duty so actually some of the people behind it were actually leaving hints about talking with different directors already cool
6048588	6050890	That would be it for my quickie stuff.
6050910	6055092	That would be interesting for a Call of Duty movie, but I suppose it's inevitable because the series is huge.
6055152	6057674	I think Call of Duty would make a great movie.
6057934	6060756	At least with Call of Duty there is an actual storyline that goes along with it.
6060836	6064338	It's not like, you know, okay, let's make a war movie and call it Call of Duty.
6065999	6066760	I still wouldn't see it.
6067220	6068861	I'm not a big fan of war movies.
6068961	6069661	I like chick flicks.
6071082	6072423	Call of Duty, the chick flick?
6072944	6074885	No, they don't need to do Call of Duty, the chick flick.
6076099	6076900	That would be pretty funny.
6077300	6080401	You know, Final Fantasy is kind of a chick flick in some ways.
6080481	6082542	Especially emo ones like Final Fantasy 7.
6082883	6085284	They turned Final Fantasy 7 into a movie that's kind of a chick flick.
6085824	6086224	A little bit.
6086745	6087165	They have.
6088546	6089166	Advent Children.
6090146	6092988	Advent Children wasn't so much a chick flick as it was just confusing.
6093068	6095109	It was non-stop action is what it was.
6095189	6096170	It doesn't need a plot.
6096210	6098231	It's just ass kickery.
6098311	6099571	Cloud is emo.
6099812	6100772	Vincent is dark.
6100932	6101733	Cloud is emo.
6101813	6102493	Vincent is dark.
6102633	6102873	Look.
6103193	6104094	Three Sephiroths.
6105134	6106075	Three Sufferbrats.
6107896	6108456	The end.
6109597	6110117	P.S.
6110337	6111198	Aerith is dead.
6111498	6111898	The end.
6112219	6114180	Tiger Claw says I like the Twilight movies.
6114440	6114980	Wrong.
6118122	6120024	Sparkly Vampires for the lose.
6120224	6121665	No, I'm not a fan of the Twilight movies.
6122886	6128949	I did tell you I sat down and tried to read the first book.
6128989	6132752	I'm glad it wasn't my book because it probably would have been the first book I ever burned.
6133035	6134317	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6146820	6148202	Back to video games, sorry.
6148823	6150124	Just proving how crappy it is.
6165544	6169545	I hope this means that we do get a console version of Trackmania 2 because it looks absolutely awesome.
6169905	6172646	You know, all the stunt racing with kind of the Forza 3 graphics.
6172766	6175546	So, hey, that's not a bad combo whatsoever.
6176306	6188949	And they say, through Nadio, Ubisoft will gain an expert team, one of the best online technologies around, as well as a flagship multiplayer game that enjoys an unrivaled reputation among the loyal and committed community.
6190790	6191750	And, yeah.
6192190	6192450	So...
6194133	6194413	Awesome!
6194453	6199680	It doesn't look like they're going to be cancelling any Trackmania games and hopefully we'll see this come to consoles.
6199920	6205687	That's what I'm really hoping for because the DS version was awesome but not as good as a console release.
6207762	6211624	Alright, well moving on to Facebook and Twitter on the Xbox 360.
6212244	6214445	You know, this is something a lot of folks have been looking forward to.
6214845	6227732	Of course, Last.fm would be a part of this as well, but speaking specifically of Facebook and Twitter, there was a splash page spotted on Xbox Live's UK portal saying that the service is going to launch November 17th.
6228132	6234455	Now, of course, again, this was on the UK portal, but if I'm not mistaking, don't you get these updates worldwide?
6234975	6236396	So if they get it on the 17th, we would too?
6236416	6236956	Pretty much, yeah.
6237236	6238337	It'd be relatively close.
6238917	6239117	Yeah.
6239818	6241219	So that's what they're saying.
6241239	6244581	This was spotted in a screenshot on the Flash page if you zoom in a lot there.
6245001	6250124	And it is just assumed, even though Last.fm isn't featured on there, that this update is going to include that as well.
6251425	6256908	So there was a little firmware update that went out not that long ago kind of prepping the Xbox 360 for this.
6257369	6260771	So this is going to be on its way, and that's assumed in November.
6260831	6263793	I guess there's also going to be a beta test I was reading somewhere at the end of October.
6263813	6263893	Yeah.
6264433	6266514	for these services.
6266614	6267955	I'm kind of eh on these.
6268395	6272817	I think the one cool thing would be maybe taking screenshots and publishing them to Facebook.
6272837	6273397	That would be cool.
6273637	6278399	But I don't see this being something I would want to use.
6278739	6284162	What I really don't want to happen is I don't want it to turn into, with all due respect to the people that made it, Raptor.
6284802	6289764	I don't want my Xbox 360 tweeting every time I put in a new game because I know that's just going to irritate people.
6290224	6293226	Part of the reason I'm really starting to hate Twitter is that there's no filters.
6294066	6296567	Facebook is basically Twitter, but with filters.
6296807	6298308	But you can also use TweetDeck.
6300008	6310152	But even with TweetDeck, you can filter a certain person's tweets, which I do use, but you can't filter the type... If a person just posts annoying things over and over, I just unfollow them.
6310652	6311072	Exactly.
6311552	6313173	I'm sorry, but it's just Twitter.
6313213	6319755	If you're going to get butthurt over me unfollowing you, get something real to worry about, like...
6320655	6341103	you know, Darfur or something, I don't know but like, don't worry about me unfriending you on Twitter, it just means you post a lot of crap, so unfortunately Twitter not having filters makes it really inferior to Facebook and hopefully there'll be a magic button where I can just block all the 360 updates from Facebook if they're annoying, but if they aren't, then maybe I'll keep it around we'll see
6342363	6364760	Last.fm on the other hand sounds very cool because I'm already using Last.fm I have like 3,000 plays chalked up on there and god some people have way more than that and I think Last.fm has a really good recommendation service I prefer it to Pandora I know a lot of people disagree with me and think Pandora is god but I like that Last.fm kind of bases its recommendations off of what you already play I use Last.fm at work sometimes Pandora is really useless to me
6365615	6366216	DarkSakura.com
6382230	6384532	So, I think Last.fm is pretty cool.
6384552	6386413	I'm excited to see how it works on Xbox.
6386453	6388014	I hope I can use it for, like, background music.
6388154	6388474	We'll see.
6389095	6392457	But, anyhow, that is all coming soon for Xbox Live Gold.
6392477	6397981	Members getting a sneak peek, but it sounds like everybody will get to access it on November 17th in the UK.
6398721	6400943	I'm sure the rest of us, hopefully, around the same time.
6401903	6409489	SSJ100Matt says in our chatroom, chat.orangehauntsradio.com, I really hope this doesn't open my gamer tag to the cam whores and porn spammers.
6409989	6410669	Oh, I hope so, too.
6411730	6417059	but seeing as you have to follow them in order to see the messages on Twitter, hopefully you know
6418940	6420381	and SalaciousPop in chat.
6420401	6421101	I like this comment.
6421541	6425384	LOL, it's not like LiveJournal where it's a grievous offense to defriend someone.
6425764	6429946	Totally agree because I totally get butt hurt when people defriend me on LiveJournal.
6429986	6430566	It's like, what did I do?
6430586	6432147	I'm doing it right now, Rob!
6432668	6432808	No!
6432928	6433448	I'll cry.
6433948	6438771	No, I do get butt hurt when people unfriend me on LiveJournal, but I put a lot more of myself out there on LiveJournal.
6439031	6441192	Twitter, I agree, is bullshit.
6441412	6441973	Facebook...
6443173	6446534	I always kind of wonder why someone would defend me on Facebook because it's just Facebook.
6446574	6450754	But LiveJournal, I actually kind of get butt hurt because I have a friends-only journal.
6451075	6454075	And so if I let someone in to read it all and then they just leave, I'm kind of sad.
6454635	6458556	So I like to know why or, you know, I'm a big boy.
6459176	6460396	Tell me if you're unfollowing me.
6460456	6465797	You post too many memes or you post too many advertisements for your LiveJournal games.
6466537	6466957	Please tell me.
6466997	6469418	Rob, I am so tired of that Survivor thing.
6470165	6472946	Which, by the way, I'm hosting season 18, and we're looking for players.
6473466	6475867	I think it's silly that there are 18 seasons.
6476708	6478769	Well, there's 20 of the real things, so believe it.
6479189	6479709	Alright, anyhow.
6480629	6482350	I'm sad that it caught up that fast.
6483791	6486512	It's no worse than roleplay gaming online.
6486552	6487212	That's what it is.
6487452	6488133	It's roleplay gaming.
6488153	6488593	Alright, anyway.
6490838	6494201	Ray Iannami in chat asked, what the hell is Farmville or Mafia Wars?
6494661	6496062	Obviously he has a thought.
6496642	6502286	I will say this though, Bejeweled Blitz got a makeover this week and it's awesome.
6502446	6504288	It's awesome.
6504408	6507390	They totally revamped the game and made it more awesomer.
6507947	6517932	Well, Facebook finally did something right, speaking of their little games, that if I don't give a shit about what game you're playing, and by the way, Loki, your wife just posted weird pictures of herself.
6519132	6519813	Wait a minute, did she?
6520213	6520613	Yes, she did.
6520653	6522334	Yes, yes.
6522774	6530898	I was trying to post my live journal post of my finishing the cabinet, and she was sitting next to me because I had my camera there that I had just taken pictures with.
6531198	6535440	Taking weird pictures of herself and standing there going, Hey, look at this.
6535741	6536221	Hey, look at this.
6536461	6536961	Hey, look at this.
6537141	6539363	Then she started taking pictures of me, too, and it was annoying.
6540883	6541924	I'm like, knock it off.
6542264	6547127	Okay, what's more annoying, wife taking pictures of you or Farmville?
6547487	6547967	Farmville.
6548948	6549328	Farmville.
6550298	6555120	But actually someone pointed out to me that you can hide those little app announcements when people announce the shit.
6555200	6555781	You didn't know that?
6555981	6557201	Well, I didn't think about it.
6557601	6565645	But the ones that were getting me is when you have like up in your little top hand corner the so-and-so sent you a big pile of poopy from sorority life.
6565785	6565985	Yes.
6566645	6590762	and I found and the thing is is that I've gone into my settings and blocked the application and blah blah blah blah blah I have a real life you know and it still gives me those little invite things whenever people send me the shit I don't care about so I found that you can go into the little thing there and then block the app from there I actually do think I did send you a big pile of poop in sorority life the other day so I'm surprised you're not using that to speaking of which
6591262	6591783	DarkSakura
6615522	6616164	You have to.
6616184	6617847	That's what we do here on the show.
6620272	6624541	Apparently, Sony and Microsoft don't understand MMOs on a console.
6625523	6625603	Um...
6627034	6627494	Thanks for watching!
6646389	6655617	You know, like Champions Online, it runs almost, you know, pretty much all of their MMOs run on the console.
6655637	6663824	It's just that they're trying to get Sony and Microsoft to understand how an MMO works and what helps it make its money.
6664384	6668067	They said that the only one that's come close is maybe Final Fantasy...
6669008	6669649	I just, I'm like...
6685306	6693948	If you are a newbie to the world of MMOs, why don't you let the people who have done them before help you with your business model?
6694968	6696628	Hey, it's worked for this.
6697289	6699449	Why don't you do it this way?
6700169	6706071	To me, I don't really see any reason why it can't be run like it is on the PC.
6706111	6707031	You buy your game.
6707511	6708771	You pay your subscription fee.
6709932	6710572	What's the big deal?
6711909	6721159	Well, you know, there have been some MMOs on consoles, but all the good ones I can think of were also on PC, like Final Fantasy XI, which might be the only console MMO.
6721740	6723302	Well, for its time, yes.
6723362	6725925	Although Final Fantasy XIV, I'm all about that.
6727326	6732232	I just still remember the day that you came over here to help me set up some of my stuff on Final Fantasy XI.
6732252	6733333	Mm-hmm.
6733815	6737039	and I was doing everything on a controller down to all my macros and everything.
6737099	6737499	Yeah, yeah.
6737659	6740302	And you looked at me going, how the fuck are you doing that?
6741083	6742324	I couldn't play that game with a controller.
6743085	6746569	I realized it was made for the PS2, but I could not play that game with a controller.
6746849	6747850	Well, no.
6747930	6748370	No, no.
6748711	6749412	I was playing on the PC.
6749432	6750653	I know, I know you were.
6750673	6751254	With a controller, yeah.
6751274	6751794	I know you were.
6751834	6753055	Because I've been playing PSO.
6753095	6754217	And I thought you were a crackhead.
6754977	6756239	Hey, I made that shit work.
6757583	6758505	I was like, shut up, please!
6769827	6779914	But it really wasn't until I got to World of Warcraft that I had to actually learn how to play with a keyboard, which sucks.
6780334	6785718	I think MMOs are certainly possible on consoles, like a console-exclusive MMO, and I kind of wish they'd go for it.
6786018	6790582	I think a game like Demon's Soul shows it's possible, even though that's not really an MMO.
6791122	6794084	It is still a massively kind of multiplayer environment.
6794184	6798387	It's just that the game doesn't revolve around the multiplayer environment.
6798987	6807771	Well, I still, by the way, I'm going to say to this day that I still wish that World of Warcraft had controller support and that I'm looking for two months of play, please.
6809512	6810592	Beg, beg, grovel, grovel.
6810732	6811153	Not really.
6813053	6815374	When my paycheck situation fixes up.
6816555	6818336	I dinged level 45 Paladin today.
6818556	6818996	Yay!
6819016	6820877	You know what level my character got to?
6821277	6821557	Seven.
6822357	6823138	Yes, exactly.
6823538	6824538	You mentioned it two weeks ago.
6824698	6824959	I know.
6825339	6826399	And I haven't played in that long.
6827120	6827380	All right.
6827440	6828040	Anyhow, Loki...
6829329	6833813	I haven't played any You've never played World of Warcraft, huh?
6833853	6857272	You sunk like three years Well, you suck for one, but you sunk like three years of your life into Final Fantasy XI and somehow never got sucked into World of Warcraft It's amazing to me This is what happens when Rob has a third a glass of wine Apparently Final Fantasy XIV, though It won't be okay to drive home Final Fantasy XIV, though I don't know Final Fantasy XIV looks so sexy
6860541	6861001	No!
6861081	6862401	You can't do this now!
6864042	6864822	I have a life.
6864962	6866263	I've already moved on.
6866383	6869584	If anything's going to cause a divorce, it's going to be Final Fantasy XIV.
6873286	6873586	Anyhow.
6874206	6875547	You better hope it has Bejeweled in it.
6876307	6878208	For your wife.
6878468	6881069	I showed her the Bejeweled Square Enix game.
6881089	6881670	You remember that?
6881990	6882530	Oh, yeah.
6883550	6884351	But it's Bejeweled Twist.
6884371	6885531	She doesn't like Bejeweled Twist.
6886111	6887092	She's like, I know.
6888418	6888838	or whatever.
6890319	6895421	So, Fifth Cell, they're looking to move on to some other platforms other than the Wii and DS.
6895882	6901724	Their next game, which is pretty big, they say, and unannounced, will be for Xbox Live Arcade.
6902405	6905706	And they go on saying that we're doing an Xbox Live Arcade title next.
6905766	6906546	It's going to be pretty big.
6906887	6907207	Well, that's...
6909027	6923034	I'm going to take a wild guess and say that it's probably going to look very similar to Drawn Life and Scribblenauts since both their games are very similar looking.
6924274	6924874	Just my guess.
6926335	6928636	I'm glad they're not doing the cheap Scribblenauts 2.
6929196	6931277	In fact, I hope they never make a sequel to Scribblenauts.
6931757	6934299	I would like to see more games that they just don't make sequels to.
6935413	6939834	I know that sounds cruel, but sometimes these series get dug into the ground.
6940895	6941755	Like the Guardian Legend.
6942315	6942515	No!
6942855	6943696	That must have a sequel.
6944616	6948637	That's one of those games where it's like, okay, 25 years later, we need a sequel to that.
6948697	6949918	Or at least a remake.
6950218	6950938	I mean, come on.
6951118	6952079	A reimagining.
6952119	6953059	How about a reimagining?
6954361	6958368	I don't like the word remake as much as I do reimagining because usually the reimagined games are better.
6959670	6962975	Like the Silent Hill game on the Wii, which that's out very soon, right?
6963416	6963857	On November.
6964899	6965960	Damn, they're going to miss Halloween?
6965980	6967623	Yeah, I got delayed.
6968204	6968685	Stupids.
6970177	6971857	Also stupid, in my opinion.
6971958	6975338	Rock Band is on its way to the iPhone, and I don't get it.
6975779	6976559	Like, I do and I don't.
6976579	6977639	It's like the PSP version.
6979039	6979420	No.
6979920	6980580	Bite your tongue.
6980620	6983401	The PSP version is amplitude or frequency.
6983641	6984481	It is awesome.
6984941	6988162	The iPhone version is just tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap.
6988522	6989403	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7005177	7006857	My opinion, I should give you some of the facts.
7007197	7009278	There is going to be a four-way multiplayer mode.
7009318	7010818	It's all done over Bluetooth.
7011718	7015159	And then you're going to have 20 games, which apparently are all in the actual game.
7015519	7025641	And of course, since the iPhone will allow you to do microtransactions now, you can bet there's going to be downloadable songs in the future that you will be able to buy these song packs from EA Mobile.
7026041	7028801	So basically, this is just Rock Band on your phone.
7029001	7030281	You can play drums with your fingers.
7031082	7033202	And in my opinion, it's a little ridiculous.
7034162	7034503	You know what?
7034523	7037327	I probably won't ever get it because I'm still playing Peggle.
7050509	7051290	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7065845	7067125	or Wikipanion or something.
7067165	7068846	I'm never on the games.
7069086	7069626	Hardly ever.
7069686	7072367	Here's what I have on mine just for games left on here right now.
7072947	7076569	It's Peggle, Cooking Mama, Vi, which was the Sega CD RPG.
7077749	7084551	I have the IMT Pain app.
7086372	7087112	Let me tell you what I have.
7087132	7088013	Hang on, we're today.
7088173	7088653	That's fun.
7089474	7090215	I have quite a few.
7090956	7105977	DDRS, Tap Tap Revenge 2, Word Fu, Labyrinth, Wild West, Silent Hill The Escape, Aurora Faint The Arena, Pinball Dreams, Peggle, Columns Deluxe, Infinity Gene Space Invaders, Civilization Revolution,
7108374	7115078	and Luminous Light, which if you listen to the mini show from last week is the most horrible adaptation of Luminous.
7115298	7117199	It's an aberration of a Luminous game.
7117639	7119480	I've also had a Light Cycle game.
7119560	7121241	Remember, I had my Light Cycle game for a while.
7121741	7126404	And I did get Katamari, which I just didn't think was as much fun as I'd hoped it would have been on the iPhone.
7126964	7129025	And I had Pole Position Remix, which was pretty fun.
7130286	7131987	Pole Position.
7132187	7134268	Mostly what I've been playing on here.
7134308	7135849	I tried Pac-Man when I didn't think it was fun.
7136192	7138694	I just think the touch controls kind of suck.
7139014	7139955	Like I'm just kind of done with it.
7139975	7140595	Except for Peggle.
7141596	7142736	Yeah, they make it work for Peggle.
7143197	7143857	I will give you that.
7144037	7146839	It's actually a lot of fun to play Peggle on the iPhone.
7147299	7148780	That would be like the first game I would recommend.
7148800	7150041	Oh yeah, I have my Solitaire game.
7151702	7152823	I had a good Sudoku game too.
7153503	7156145	Well anyhow, Rock Band's coming to the iPhone and I don't care.
7156746	7157366	But maybe you do.
7158026	7159968	I'm sure there will be plenty of folks that download this.
7159988	7161309	They're not going to have a problem selling this.
7162790	7163190	There you go.
7164693	7176484	Anyhow, let's get into the part of the show that is all about you guys and the emails that you send us every week to Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com It's our Orange Lounge Radio Mailbag segment.
7177785	7178666	I know, I'm excited too.
7179086	7183490	DarkSakura is going to jump in head first in the email bag and pull out some emails to read.
7183650	7188034	I doubt it's very full this week as we didn't have a show last week really.
7188114	7189115	Well, we had a pre-taped show.
7189275	7190216	We had a number.
7190576	7191057	A tiny show.
7191837	7194939	Anyway, this comes from Slapshot, I'm gonna guess.
7195659	7204163	Hey guys, I know you probably won't read this on this show because of the content, but I have a question about trying out, quote, Sims 3.
7205264	7208746	Everything has installed fine, and I'm using Magic Disk for my ISO.
7210406	7210827	I see.
7210927	7212587	Yeah, I'm gonna go ahead and do it online, I don't care.
7213088	7217310	After Sims 3 loads up, it gives me the error saying I don't have a disk in my drive.
7217390	7218270	Any suggestions?
7218390	7219011	Thanks a lot.
7219571	7219651	Um...
7221693	7222454	I have a suggestion.
7222574	7223274	Buy the game.
7224515	7225256	That'll fix it.
7225496	7228758	Having a physical disc would probably be advisable.
7229339	7238925	I don't mean to give you shit, but when you decide to pirate games, getting low quality and crap like this happening to you is exactly what you sign up for.
7239426	7244650	So, like, if this were fmylife.com, I'd be clicking you deserved it right now.
7245350	7269527	so sorry I don't have any real advice for you but you know what there comes a point where we have to say enough piracy is enough and dude just buy the game I'm sorry I was actually suddenly looking at the back of my box yeah cause my Sims 3 box is like sitting here on my desk because I keep the game in my damn drive and take it out to burn DVDs so who else has seen the back of your box?
7272921	7274222	Look!
7274242	7274302	Ooh!
7274962	7276243	Rob, it's my box.
7276303	7277103	It's green.
7277824	7280325	And look, my box has a car.
7281866	7282827	I need to see a doctor.
7283527	7284608	Next email, quick.
7284868	7285768	Give me a doctor!
7286228	7287349	Okay.
7288410	7290471	This is from our buddy Robb.
7292202	7296426	Although this is not podcast material, I just wanted to share about my first trip to Disneyland.
7296546	7297728	Oh, it's podcast material.
7298368	7299930	I can see why you guys love it so much.
7299970	7303033	The Nightmare Before Christmas Haunted Mansion was amazing and worth the trip alone.
7303493	7309099	I also noticed that your Pirates of the Caribbean ride has the same basic components, but it is just plain better.
7309139	7310981	Well, that's because we have two drops on ours.
7312532	7316654	You know the one over in Florida has one drop.
7317214	7321776	Sorry, we just had a feed drop in our state, so I was talking to the chatters.
7321816	7322357	What is this about?
7322397	7322717	I'm sorry.
7323417	7324178	It's Disneyland.
7324518	7324958	Oh, yay!
7324978	7327119	That's right, he went.
7327179	7328900	He went the one week I didn't go.
7329020	7332181	Because I went, and then I stayed here a week, and then I went again.
7332221	7333262	And he was there the week I was home.
7333959	7341946	Well, going forward, I love California Adventure too, so I looked it up on Google Maps and saw something cool in the lagoon, which still had water in the picture.
7342287	7346611	There appears to be an earthquake happening based on the interference pattern on the surface.
7347091	7358782	A normal lagoon of that size would normally have small irregular waves, not evenly spaced and consistent wave patterns, except that the lagoon water is filtered and runs through cyclically.
7360327	7362728	So, well, it did when they had one.
7363548	7369510	So, because I've actually got to peek in the lagoon now that it's dumped out and they're redoing shit.
7369810	7374692	So, but yeah, actually I love looking at, just look at Disneyland over on Google Maps.
7374712	7375232	That's pretty cool.
7375836	7377457	It's kind of fun to go on a virtual tour of Disneyland.
7377797	7380457	I love Google Maps just to go on virtual tours of just about anything.
7380898	7385499	But I'm really glad to hear Robaba had fun at Disneyland because it is a fun place.
7385899	7388380	I'm hoping to go one more time before my season pass expires.
7389620	7392141	I keep forgetting if we said it was Shook.
7392601	7393381	I think you said Shook.
7393762	7394322	I think it is Shook.
7394542	7394782	Okay.
7395422	7396584	Hello, OLR.
7396624	7399387	First off, I'd like to say that my fight with my father is over.
7399968	7401089	Yay!
7401109	7403712	Wait, I thought it was resolved in a previous episode of OLR.
7404393	7406155	Well, his dad took the game away, remember?
7406416	7407857	Yeah, but I thought they made up.
7408358	7409820	I talked to him, quoting you guys.
7409860	7412723	I hope you didn't quote the kind of rude stuff that we said, because...
7414245	7416166	Anyway, but he seemed understanding for once.
7416186	7420628	He tried playing Final Fantasy X, and he actually seemed to love it, most notably the metal music.
7421129	7422289	Now, on to the main story.
7422389	7426952	I was in gym class playing American football when an idiot in my class fouls the ball.
7427412	7430213	He runs over to the ball and starts teabagging the ball.
7431294	7432014	Let that sink in.
7433975	7435956	I swear to God, we read this email the week you weren't here.
7436356	7436657	Did you?
7437137	7439858	But I'm looking at the date that email was received, and it was Friday.
7439878	7441179	I wonder if dudes have emailed twice.
7441954	7444417	Oh, well, if you already read it, then... Go ahead and finish.
7444477	7446078	Is it about the lewd sexual behavior?
7446259	7446999	Yeah, you weren't here.
7447079	7447400	Go ahead.
7447700	7448721	You can put your opinion on it.
7448941	7450523	I don't know if you already read it, then.
7451224	7451965	I could be wrong.
7452765	7454347	Chatters, does this email sound familiar?
7454667	7457350	Like, that's why I said I could swear we had a resolution on the, um...
7459351	7466253	The Coach grabs him by the neck, drags him inside, screaming, you little son of a bitch.
7467273	7470834	The idiot was suspended for lewd sexual behavior.
7471274	7474195	It just goes to show how far gaming has taken us in society.
7474815	7480016	It truly is the shit like this that gives us good gamers a bad stereotyped name.
7481916	7484737	What really pisses me the hell off slash rant.
7486597	7486957	P.S.
7487097	7490178	A few weeks ago, Juan ranted about old people not wearing bras.
7491298	7491959	He was right.
7492119	7497600	My old bag of an English teacher let out a knit slip in front of everyone.
7497840	7498160	Gag.
7498560	7498720	Ew.
7500361	7502701	You've got a fucked up school, dude.
7503121	7507922	Your English teachers are showing their ta-tas and your gym teachers are throwing people against the wall calling them sons of bitches.
7507982	7509083	Like, seriously?
7509163	7509983	Go to private school?
7512322	7516986	Well, first of all, the behavior was... Tell your dad we said that, too.
7518087	7526994	The behavior of the idiot playing football was indeed unnecessary and deserved punishment, but... Has nothing to do with games.
7527865	7528985	Yeah, that has nothing to do with games.
7529145	7540869	The coach, however, seriously needed to also be suspended at least for a game or have some sort of probationary measure taken.
7541610	7545251	And then your English teacher does need to wear a better bra.
7546305	7548046	This sounds like the high school in Glee.
7548306	7551307	Like, only random shit happens.
7551807	7552528	You've got an interesting life.
7552548	7560671	None of that ever happened at mine except for one teacher accidentally ripping his pants in.
7560971	7563292	I always saw his underwear, but still.
7564092	7568954	Shook, I hope you're writing all this down so that you can write an epic autobiography someday.
7569234	7570375	A memoir, if you will.
7572154	7574336	Dude, sell it to a reality show or something.
7574797	7575818	Of course, you know I won't watch it.
7577780	7578701	You're so kind.
7578841	7580703	I don't watch a reality show.
7580743	7581643	Sorry, you know.
7582624	7584626	Okay, this next one comes from SonicM88.
7584887	7585147	Hello, OLR!
7585187	7585227	Hi.
7591721	7592742	I was just responding.
7593362	7594883	I miss you guys a ton.
7596104	7596945	Wow, a ton.
7596985	7598486	That's 2,000 pounds.
7599067	7605892	I haven't been able to listen to you guys forever for several months for complicated reasons, but I needed to let you guys know something.
7606292	7611557	Rob, I remember way back in an old podcast you used to talk about how much you loved Alanis Morissette and Rock Band 2.
7612217	7616480	Well, as I'm sure you know, two additional Alanis Morissette songs came as downloadable content.
7616520	7616741	What?
7617842	7618122	Really?
7618142	7618222	Yeah.
7620218	7624080	I was probably just as stoked as you were to hear that they were coming out.
7624100	7624520	You lie!
7625121	7631844	So I bought them as soon as I could and for you I decided to get first place on both of them, Ironic and Head Over Feet on vocals.
7632184	7632744	Wait a minute, wait a minute.
7632924	7633184	Hold on.
7633404	7635565	Loki, Alanis tracks came out on Rock Band?
7636105	7636586	I missed this.
7637926	7638687	There may have been some.
7638847	7641528	You know we didn't cover Rock Band releases last week because we didn't have a show.
7642128	7642868	Maybe it did happen.
7643329	7643789	Chatters?
7644529	7645389	Did I really miss that?
7645429	7646250	Can I continue?
7646370	7647851	Figure it's the one week that you don't do it.
7647951	7648531	I know, right?
7649503	7652790	As of this posting, I'm still first on Xbox 360 leaderboards.
7652850	7658240	Gamertag LucasPones8907.
7658842	7660004	Orange Children Radio rocks.
7660264	7661407	He sends a follow-up email, though.
7663044	7667788	It seems someone's taking my first place on head over feet, but I'm working hard for first again for you, Rob.
7668249	7672472	I'm still first on ironic, though, but maybe I shouldn't say that or I'll jinx my score again.
7672933	7674814	Dude, I'll play expert with you or something.
7674914	7675935	We'll take over the leaderboards.
7676115	7676996	I did not know that.
7677516	7678958	Now I gotta get my Xbox 360 back.
7679658	7680099	There you go.
7680139	7682561	You asked earlier what it would take to get my 360 back.
7683041	7684983	What's gonna light the fire under Rob's ass?
7685203	7686144	Alanis and Rock Band.
7686164	7688286	Hey, you know what lit the fire under your ass for, uh...
7689383	7690183	for PS3.
7690424	7691684	Abba.
7692164	7692945	Oh, yeah, SingStar Abba.
7692985	7694546	Yeah, that was a big, big seller, too.
7695566	7696327	Which I still play.
7696767	7698608	You need to play some Beatles Rock Band with me.
7698628	7699768	You can dance.
7699928	7700149	Anyway.
7700909	7702570	I did pretty damn good, okay?
7702770	7704611	I blame you now for me playing Beatles Rock Band.
7705551	7707412	For getting me up there and making me sing.
7707612	7710994	There is much more to the cast of Orange Lounge Radio than just video games.
7711054	7715096	And I will say, and I am not ashamed to admit, I'm a huge Alanis Morissette fan.
7715116	7715576	And that was my...
7717455	7720421	Like musical muse in high school, like for real.
7720962	7728957	Did you, did you actually, did you watch the video that I posted on Facebook a while back, which was the metaphor-free radio thing from College Humor?
7731111	7734274	Was that the... The guy sitting in the car?
7734835	7735535	No, I didn't see that one.
7736016	7737977	I saw the Total Eclipse of the Heart little video.
7738037	7746965	It was basically a guy listening to his radio and says, and now on Sublight Radio we have metaphor-free radio and then it was all these songs doing literally what the songs mean.
7747386	7752370	And the Alanis part was, I hate you, Dave Coulier!
7754398	7755719	Shut the front door.
7755819	7757981	TigerClaw just linked me to Rockband.com.
7758041	7760042	Sure enough, this happened on October 2nd.
7760543	7761744	This would have been the week we weren't here.
7762124	7762825	This was last week.
7764086	7767408	That's just what goes to show if we miss a session.
7767608	7769209	Electric Six and Flowbots.
7770891	7773533	Oh my god, Gay Bar by Electric Six is in Rockband.
7773553	7774594	That song is awesome.
7774614	7774794	Sweet!
7775434	7777876	You, I want to take you to a gay bar.
7779277	7780378	That song is rad.
7780678	7782259	Dude, we missed an awesome week.
7782460	7783841	Do you have that on your computer, Rob?
7785416	7790303	I do, but iTunes will slow things down significantly.
7790403	7800378	However, this is why we have such wonderful things like YouTube, so that when you're in the middle of a radio show, you can actually just pull it up and you can actually get the song.
7812332	7830180	I wanna take you to a game bar I wanna take you to a game bar I wanna take you to a game bar Game bar, game bar Let's stop Stop Why is war censored on YouTube?
7830241	7835143	Is that because it's Abraham Lincoln wearing no pants and you can't say war?
7835583	7837504	On a spin bike at that
7847745	7850727	Tell me you do not want to play this in Rock Band right the fuck now.
7851087	7851667	Seriously.
7854649	7856190	That looks like Abraham Lincoln.
7856210	7857010	That'd be awesome.
7857070	7858051	Wearing spandex.
7860012	7862353	Seriously, after the show, YouTube that immediately.
7862413	7862974	It's hilarity.
7864174	7864695	It really is.
7865675	7866696	That song is awesome.
7867853	7877120	Anyhow, thank you, emailer, for alerting us to such awesomeness in rock band that we missed the week of... Ranma is throwing up the horns, but he's doing it wrong.
7877580	7880302	Ironically enough, the week of gay days at Disneyland.
7881263	7887047	Ranma is throwing up the horns the wrong way because really that's too much metal for one hand.
7889229	7890369	Too much metal at the gay bar.
7890889	7891149	All right.
7891250	7898611	Anyhow, let's move on to the FUs of the week, which I sadly don't really have a story to inspire tonight.
7899612	7901492	So we're just going to get into the FUs of the week.
7902212	7907514	I thought there was something in our show role about a lawsuit, but I guess maybe it was something I cut out accidentally.
7908274	7908594	Whatever.
7909154	7910274	It's one of those nights tonight.
7910674	7913235	I've been drinking wine, and now I have gay bar on repeat in my head.
7915176	7916716	Now Loki's singing it over there.
7918149	7918950	I just said one line.
7919370	7919850	Alright, anyhow.
7921851	7923192	Here come the FUs of the week.
7924193	7936461	A chance for a little angst in your life.
7937262	7946748	FU to EDD and other disability things for the lovely gap in my paycheck.
7948228	7953390	which has not been fun because I like to have money with which to pay my bills.
7954910	7969155	I really like being able to pay my bills because it means that I can eat and have a place to live without feeling completely guilty for taking advantage of my friend's generosity.
7970075	7977578	And there's also this wonderful concept, Rob, of power and internet.
7978243	7978883	I love them.
7979444	7980064	Love them both.
7981305	7984487	I would seriously go without eating before I didn't pay the internet bill.
7986028	7991291	Honestly, I realize my priorities are fucked, but... I'll put it this way.
7991552	7994774	I found food in my fridge that I didn't even know existed.
7995694	8000817	And then once we got a little bit of a break, thanks to...
8002708	8004809	Thanks to me getting some massage work in.
8004869	8007309	Thanks to having a very good, generous friend.
8007669	8010270	And thanks to a little bit of a break on our rent.
8010730	8014131	So we actually were able to go get groceries and get some of our bills paid.
8014451	8015892	I might take you out for a massage, by the way.
8015932	8016472	I could use one.
8016732	8017592	If you're still giving them out.
8018072	8018412	50 bucks?
8018912	8019933	I might actually go for it.
8020033	8020453	For an hour?
8020913	8021273	For an hour.
8022033	8022493	I might do it.
8022713	8024394	I might have friends that are interested, too, if you really want.
8024974	8027055	As long as they won't report me for not having my business license.
8027435	8027535	Oh.
8029810	8033232	Well, I don't know about that, but I can't get a PA there.
8033332	8034133	Rob, Rob.
8034293	8034553	What?
8035153	8036975	I cannot charge for that.
8038055	8038336	Wink.
8038536	8039056	Wink.
8039917	8040617	Okay, I get it.
8041057	8042478	Well, do I get a happy ending?
8043459	8044059	Just kidding.
8044099	8044660	I don't want that.
8044720	8045040	Gross.
8045100	8048202	I'll find you a kilted Scotsman for it.
8048723	8049463	Loki, your F.U.
8049483	8049824	to the week.
8050624	8050804	F.U.
8050844	8051445	to the guy.
8052365	8053286	It's actually kind of my fault.
8053626	8053726	F.U.
8053766	8064852	to me, answering the door to my house, because every time I do, it's always somebody that's trying to sell me something, and for some reason I end up getting roped into buying something.
8064952	8070375	Well, in this case, it was actually a guy coming up to quote us for a new roof, which is fine, because we needed that, and I wanted to quote for a new roof.
8070868	8073911	But he sat there and talked to us for two hours and that was just unacceptable.
8073931	8076573	I just wanted him to give me a damn price because I knew it was going to be expensive anyways.
8077174	8086202	But he sat there and talked about how his roofing system is the most awesome thing in the world and I really don't give a crap because I was in the middle of soldering for my new cabinet.
8087643	8088464	And you don't interrupt that.
8091350	8106669	F you to something I didn't bring up earlier in the show but F you to the fact that my World of Warcraft account got hacked this week while I was on vacation I got a call Monday morning from my buddy Shane who said that all my characters were logging in and out of Ravencrest and I said boy that's really funny because I'm not playing the game right now
8107349	8108490	In fact, I'm in Los Angeles.
8108810	8111512	Turns out my password was stolen and my account was hacked.
8112592	8114253	Which makes me feel very vulnerable.
8114753	8117595	Because if they have my WoW password, what else do they have?
8118235	8124619	Now granted, I removed an authenticator from my account, which yes, you might think is stupid, but the keychain broke.
8124819	8127540	So I was going to lose that authenticator if I didn't remove it from my account.
8127820	8132723	So they could have stolen my password from my ex-boyfriend's computer, maybe his was insecure, I don't know.
8133083	8136205	But all I know is that it makes me very nervous to know that I have passwords stolen.
8136465	8139086	So I had to go change all of my passwords and everything.
8139686	8144548	To Blizzard's credit, very nice customer service, even though it took me forever to get through.
8144908	8151270	Like, they had a 30-minute hold time Monday morning, and I even called, like, right before close, and I still had to wait 18 minutes before I got a representative.
8151670	8154571	But to be fair, she was very nice, did everything she was supposed to do.
8154831	8158632	I train customer service for call centers, so I'm always very scrutinizing those people.
8158933	8162814	She was a very good rep, and I got an email from a lady that was very nice at Blizzard, too.
8163444	8164885	The GMs fixed my stuff.
8164905	8166346	Probably the whole thing took about three to four days.
8166626	8169168	But fuck you to people who steal passwords.
8169508	8173811	And I've decided I'm completely against people buying gold in WoW at this point.
8174131	8174651	You know why?
8175031	8177553	Because you only encourage these assholes to do what they do.
8178213	8179834	So if you buy gold in WoW, fuck you.
8179854	8180275	There you go.
8186698	8188739	Xlink in chat says, wow, rape?
8188959	8193682	Damn, yes, I feel like I was raped in the face by a Warcraft hacker.
8194342	8197443	Loomies in chat says, Rob, I had to wait an hour and a half on Friday morning.
8197483	8199324	I should get everything restored in two to four days.
8199745	8204627	Well, sadly, I guess it wasn't, I mean, I'm glad to hear it wasn't just me, but at the same time, that really sucks.
8205327	8206988	Yeah, it takes a couple days to get everything restored.
8207028	8207869	See, now the good news was...
8208649	8209069	Thanks for watching!
8225905	8229626	The story I was going to read to lead into the FUs tonight for some reason I forgot to link it.
8230547	8239590	There was a dude that got banned from the Sony PlayStation Network and he was going to file a lawsuit or he did file a lawsuit saying that his First Amendment rights were breached.
8240410	8241971	Well, and what's wrong with this picture?
8242311	8245232	Can your First Amendment rights really be breached when you're banned from the PlayStation Network?
8246494	8249157	No, because PlayStation Network is a private network.
8249758	8261390	And that's exactly what Judge Ronald M. White said in a federal court in the Northern District of California earlier this week, is that there was no plausible First Amendment cause and threw out the lawsuit.
8261750	8272956	But interesting from some of the commenters here on Kotaku where I saw this story, I thought a really good point that was brought up by one of the commenters is that when you buy stuff on PlayStation Network, it's tied to your login name.
8273296	8278779	So if you suddenly get banned from WoW, not only do you lose your access, you lose everything you bought.
8279739	8281460	That is kind of messed up, in a way.
8281840	8284922	Although, granted, if you did something really bad, maybe you had it coming.
8284942	8288043	It's also in the Terms of Service, and you have to read that.
8288584	8289964	But that's shady.
8290024	8290845	That's a little shady.
8290905	8293426	Throw all this money at us to buy online stuff and then get banned?
8293546	8295727	It's an incentive for him not to be a douchebag.
8296208	8305913	Now, what is kind of messed up, and yeah, you may not realize it, like, for example, the PlayStation Network forums, where it's tied to your account,
8306553	8312257	You get banned from the forums, you get banned from PlayStation Network, which is kind of shady because you may not realize that.
8312337	8314538	But once again, read your terms of service.
8314918	8315198	Wow.
8315238	8316159	And don't be a douchebag.
8316559	8319381	Yeah, I mean, I agree with don't be a douchebag, and maybe he had it coming in a way.
8319401	8321502	But at the same time, what if a mistake happens?
8321682	8329667	Because I'm comparing apples to oranges here, but on the Xbox side of things, if you get banned, there's no way to contest it, which I think is kind of fucked up.
8330188	8331789	I think there should be a way you can contest it.
8332429	8333249	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
8361764	8366488	I heard it might have been an exploit in Flash that got me, but still, terrible.
8367709	8368449	Terrible, terrible.
8368990	8371572	Alright, just a couple more stories for you guys, and then your calls, Loki.
8372653	8383521	Yes, so EA has trademarked a new game called The Ripper, and what it's believed to be is actually a game based on Jack the Ripper, and apparently...
8386457	8387178	Jack the Ripper
8413018	8416520	This is similar to a movie where you're killing demons with its people and stuff like that.
8417321	8424266	So yeah, think of like I guess a Dead Space game where you're Jack the Ripper ripping people apart, but they're really demons so you shouldn't feel so bad about it.
8426528	8427428	Praise Jack the Ripper.
8428549	8430150	Interesting, I guess.
8430610	8436274	And it's believed that this is Visceral Games' new action title.
8439537	8439877	All right.
8441209	8442250	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
8464649	8464829	All right.
8464869	8466130	Anyhow, one more story for you guys.
8466150	8471514	Then we're going to open up the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
8471534	8474877	I'm hoping to hear from some new people tonight because I know we have some new people listening.
8474937	8477679	So 1-877-GAME-OLR, username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
8477719	8481782	We have one more story for you guys involving one of my favorite games.
8481842	8486286	In fact, probably my favorite game ever on the Commodore 64, at least I can think of right now.
8486946	8487466	Archon.
8487627	8488487	Remember Archon?
8489068	8506399	It was like Battle Chess but cooler because it wasn't actually chess but it was dark versus light and you were trying to take over these power squares but when two pieces would come together like the Shapeshifter and the Phoenix or the Banshee and the Valkyrie they would do battle in this arena and you would basically have to kill one other piece.
8506799	8510062	So it wasn't like chess where whoever was the attacker was always the victor.
8510362	8511322	Two pieces would fight.
8511563	8514304	Well the game came on the iPhone not that long ago.
8514364	8516626	There was a version of it released for iPhone which I forgot about.
8516866	8517607	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
8533809	8539093	In bringing Archon back to the PC, we've really focused on maintaining the classic feel of the original game.
8539493	8542876	That said, there were aspects of the title that needed updating for the modern audience.
8543176	8549000	For example, the addition of four players was never in the original, but it adds so much fun it feels like it always belonged there.
8549281	8554585	So yes, there are achievements and HD resolution, online support, it's all going to be there.
8554665	8558387	And apparently there's going to be a new Archon-based iPhone game as well.
8559128	8559648	It's going to be...
8560869	8565912	A single player experience with four campaigns, 60 quests, unique enemies, and characters.
8566632	8569714	It's all going to use NG Moco's Plus technology.
8570094	8572716	Awards and a leaderboard and all that fun stuff.
8573476	8577999	Archon Conquest, submitted to the App Store earlier this month, should be out anytime now.
8578499	8578859	Battle Chess
8603188	8603888	Yeah, I never played the game.
8625655	8628077	1-877-GAME-OLR or username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
8628097	8630339	It's that time of the show where we're going to take your calls.
8630780	8637146	So give us a call and comment on anything you've heard about tonight or any topic we haven't discussed that you'd like us to get into.
8637466	8645534	Before we get into that and before the calls start rolling in since there is a little delay before the calls hit our line when you guys hear it, Loki, any last minute stories?
8647376	8650378	Um... Yeah, the Oddworld games are coming to the PlayStation Network.
8650918	8656402	And apparently titles that were exclusive before are also now coming to the PC.
8656902	8659544	They have a new pack that they're basically releasing them under.
8659664	8661746	I guess the, um... What was it?
8661786	8667390	The, uh... Original... The Oddbox.
8667650	8668150	That's what it was.
8668550	8673594	Including, um... Looks like, uh... Stranger's Wrath, um...
8674551	8678178	Munch's Odyssey and the original Oddworld game.
8678339	8679040	So that's kind of cool.
8680924	8681225	That's it.
8681365	8682728	Let me get to the phones.
8682808	8683369	We have a call.
8683429	8684591	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
8686530	8688411	Hello, you're... Oh my gosh, Skype crashed on me.
8688491	8689171	That sucks.
8689291	8690451	That was not the caller's fault.
8690471	8691972	That was Skype's fault.
8692112	8692772	It just crashed.
8693112	8693612	Bad Skype.
8694153	8694773	Bad Skype.
8694853	8695333	Naughty, naughty.
8695353	8698634	And I apologize to the caller that was on the line waiting to talk to us.
8699314	8701175	But computer crashes, I guess, are inevitable.
8701195	8705236	Thank God Adobe Audition didn't crash or we'd lose all Part B of our show.
8705276	8706057	Wouldn't that be lovely?
8706517	8707157	Do over.
8707177	8710738	I'm going to call that person back because they did get through.
8713649	8714289	This is a nice thing.
8714309	8715750	When you call through Skype, I know who it is.
8716070	8718731	Hi, you're on Orange Noms Radio.
8718771	8719151	Who's this?
8719791	8720611	Hey, this is X-Link.
8720631	8721231	Hi, X-Link.
8721271	8722952	I don't know if you heard if the buffer made it through.
8722992	8725013	For some reason, Skype crashed, so we called you back.
8725653	8726293	No, thank you.
8726313	8726833	I appreciate it.
8727173	8728434	No, I was on there, and I saw that.
8728454	8729554	I was like, wow, that's kind of interesting.
8729594	8734576	I thought it was my end because I'm having problems with my laptop right now with my mouse pad part.
8734696	8738057	Instead of clicking once, I click like five different times.
8738317	8739317	Nah, Skype just sucks.
8739497	8741358	Although I am thinking about using it on my PSP.
8741438	8744279	I have a PSP headset and I can use Skype on it, but I'm like, who would call me?
8745199	8747439	Like, nobody calls my iPhone.
8747479	8748880	Why would people call me on Skype?
8748980	8749280	I don't know.
8749360	8750160	Anyway, sorry.
8750220	8751200	That would be kind of interesting.
8752121	8752721	A few things.
8752901	8754761	I'm going to make this quick, of course.
8754781	8757362	I'm going to go through a few things here really quickly.
8757442	8761103	The PSP Mini prices are actually pretty decent.
8761263	8765424	The only one that's really the highest point as of right now would be the Tetris game.
8765724	8765824	Um,
8766880	8766940	E.A.
8766960	8769242	is going to be a little more expensive because of the E.A.
8769262	8770203	brand name being on it.
8770263	8770783	Oh, hell, of course.
8795330	8797131	As for the Kingdom Hearts, I played a new one.
8797171	8798512	I've been playing a new one for DS.
8798613	8803216	I'm not going to give anything away storyline-wise, but I'm going to say I know you're a big fan of it.
8803316	8805438	Play it when you get a chance or buy it.
8806018	8807980	It's worthwhile.
8808140	8809301	It's been a lot of fun.
8809361	8813204	I've been playing it about 10 hours, and I've been pretty much addicted to it.
8814525	8816186	And there is a lot of Disney characters in it.
8816326	8818328	Okay, as long as they didn't cut out the Disney, then I'm happy.
8818588	8819348	How about Tron?
8819468	8820449	You can spoil that for me.
8820489	8821090	Is Tron in it?
8821954	8822975	I don't know.
8823215	8824696	To be quite honest, I only played 10 hours.
8826177	8828078	I'm only on the second, third world.
8828378	8832020	I was going to say, was 10 hours enough to get past the prologue like Kingdom Hearts 2?
8832741	8833261	Oh, definitely.
8833361	8839565	You know, there's a lot of talk in the beginning, and there's a lot of the beginning where they're saying, okay, this button does this, this does this.
8839685	8841386	If you press this button, it does this.
8841946	8843507	This is how you do stuff in the game.
8843607	8846889	But once you get past all of it, it pretty much becomes normal.
8847330	8847490	Hmm.
8848226	8850527	All right, well, I'll have to check that out, I suppose.
8851528	8855930	Does it play like the PlayStation Kingdom Hearts games, or is it that crappy card at all?
8855950	8857131	It plays like the PS, yes.
8857151	8860193	The PS1, the Kingdom Hearts, and Kingdom Hearts 2, it does play like that.
8860413	8860633	Good.
8860653	8861914	It's not like the Chain of Memory.
8862074	8862494	Thank God.
8862734	8862934	Good.
8864535	8870438	So I'm waiting for Birth By Sleep for the PSP now, so hopefully that will work as well, too.
8870498	8872299	So we'll see on that one.
8873160	8873560	Very cool.
8873922	8877524	I'll tell you if you want a headache, try playing Chain of Memories on a micro.
8877544	8879264	No, thank you.
8879885	8880465	No, thank you.
8881085	8882566	I'll pass on that one.
8882666	8890009	I do have the original, though, for the Game Boy Advance.
8890469	8892410	That was the last one I tried to play on any handheld.
8894579	8896280	I can only imagine what a headache machine that was.
8896981	8898201	Anything else on your mind tonight, X-Link?
8898241	8900623	Well, it was kind of funny you brought up the whole hacking issue.
8900703	8904925	Wasn't there having a problem with the Xbox Live and the hacking on that one too?
8905225	8908927	Some people were trying to get people's accounts to that one that had high game scores.
8909107	8911188	Yeah, it was retarded stuff.
8911248	8918272	It was like some kid sending voice messages to people saying, I can give you cheats or whatever if you send me your account information.
8919393	8921854	You'd have to be an idiot to fall for that.
8922628	8926629	Yeah, I've never had a problem on Xbox Live, at least that I know of yet.
8926869	8930270	I mean, I've been out of Xbox Live for about two months now, so.
8932371	8935812	I've been on longer than that, so I've been busy doing my school stuff, so.
8936232	8948716	Yeah, I understand that, but they're trying to probably, it would sound like someone they were pulling back in the, you know, hey days of, hey, give me, I'm so and so, I'm surprised or not, I'm so and so from Xbox Live, I need your name and password, there's been a system server crash, that type of deal.
8949656	8953479	Well, I hope everyone knows by now, nobody will ask you for your name and password online.
8954440	8954860	Nobody.
8955521	8956321	It just doesn't happen.
8956382	8957803	Not through email, not online.
8957943	8958543	It doesn't happen.
8959344	8961205	Even when you call support, they don't ask for it.
8961225	8962867	They have ways of verifying you in other ways.
8964768	8974476	Like I know with Blizzard, I guess I filled out a security question about like, for example, this wasn't my security question, but like an example would be, what was your house number as a child?
8974817	8977078	You know, things that only you would know that a hacker wouldn't know.
8978999	8980420	Well, anything else on your mind tonight, X-Link?
8981040	8982081	No, that's pretty much about it.
8982341	8983342	I'm playing with Demon's Soul.
8983362	8989266	I heard that's one of the hardest ones yet from Atlus, and I'm hearing they're getting good reviews from it, so have a lot of fun with that.
8989386	8998133	Although I can see from a critical standpoint where it's getting good reviews and I'm not knocking the game at all, but the difficulty is really going to turn some people off, so proceed carefully.
8998618	9002301	Oh, I agree, but hey, Atlas RPGs, you can't really beat that.
9002381	9007165	I mean, pretty much everything they have sealed with their name on there has been pretty much gold.
9007345	9008405	Alright, fair enough.
9008446	9009246	They do make good stuff.
9009586	9010567	Alright, take care, X-Link.
9010927	9011448	Yeah, you too.
9011468	9011988	Thanks for the call.
9013109	9014830	We got comments in chat here.
9015371	9016412	What is this?
9017312	9023397	KillGannon1337 says, I wonder if Rob's WoW pass was secure, like caps, numbers, and shit.
9024318	9027160	I didn't use caps, but my password...
9028615	9055559	to somebody who wouldn't know better would look like a random jumble of letters they meant something to me but for most people just look like a random jumble of letters and numbers I did use both letters and numbers so I don't think by any means it was easy to guess like it wasn't like a pet name it wasn't you know anything like that so let's go to another call hi you're on Orange Launch Radio who's this hello you're on Orange Launch Radio who's this
9058274	9060096	Hola, bienvenidos a Orange Lounge Radio.
9060216	9060557	Quien es?
9062339	9063400	Okay, I guess the person isn't there.
9063821	9069068	Remember, you can always call Echo 123 before you give us a call to make sure your setup works.
9069528	9070469	That's always a good idea.
9071090	9073834	So, there you go.
9073854	9077158	1-877-GAME-OLR or username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
9081940	9082840	Hi, this is Spazinator.
9083601	9083901	Oh, pretty good.
9083921	9084281	How are you?
9084301	9084781	Two quick hits.
9084981	9090543	I don't want to take up too much time because you're near the end of your show.
9107709	9116971	Um, I got, you know, one tip of information, uh, regarding, you know, the PSN store, uh, released from, uh, I think it was last week.
9117091	9117411	Yeah.
9118011	9124293	And, you know, also, at the same time, I also want to put some on about, uh, the PlayStation 3 as well.
9124813	9129754	Um, there was one, uh, release, uh, on the PSN store.
9129854	9133455	It's a PS1 classic that I think you guys may have liked.
9134122	9138884	It was Pandemonium, which was put up by, I think, Crystal Dynamics.
9139625	9143126	Yes, I've never played the game, but I've heard of it.
9143146	9148609	I actually have the Japanese version of it, which was Magical Hoppers.
9150830	9151450	Oh, yeah.
9151610	9153671	I used to have the disc version.
9153851	9159254	Unfortunately, I had that stolen a couple years ago, so I just bought the download version now.
9160794	9161475	It's pretty good.
9161495	9166237	The graphics are kind of dated by today's standards, but all in all, it's pretty good.
9167698	9178843	As far as my complaint, it isn't so much with the system itself, it's just some of the mass stupidity of some of the other users on it.
9179124	9185807	You know how with the messaging on there, they get the whole cut and paste kind of deal on there?
9187936	9190097	Well, I don't know if you've seen this yet or not.
9190777	9192578	If not, you probably will see it soon.
9193258	9197881	But, you know, people have been doing the unpaced chain messages.
9198221	9199001	Oh, no.
9200742	9201502	Oh, yeah.
9201702	9213728	It's like, you know, if you send this message to X number of people, Sony's going to see this, and they're going to track this message, and
9214161	9217265	You know, if they'll release Halo on the PlayStation 3.
9217445	9218326	Oh my god.
9219207	9219828	Ridiculous.
9219848	9221650	Yeah, I'm like, yeah, really.
9221690	9222752	That's why I'm thinking A.
9224427	9227889	Hilo, Gears, and all their Microsoft exclusives
9246121	9247462	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
9265459	9266400	No, they don't.
9266480	9271242	They only put this stuff in the front end as another feature.
9271302	9275404	But they don't read your messages you're sending to other people, and they don't track messages.
9275444	9276324	That's a bunch of crap.
9277765	9283888	Yeah, that's what I've been saying to the people that have been sending me these.
9283928	9292952	I just tell them that by sending these messages, you're annoying the crap out of other people, and you're just showing how ignorant you are.
9292972	9294413	I mean, you know...
9295095	9302877	Using the prior example I gave, Microsoft exclusives aren't going to remain Microsoft exclusives.
9303277	9312960	Pics will fly out for some reason before those exclusives will show up on PS3 and vice versa.
9313360	9313720	Exactly.
9313760	9318381	That kind of stuff is just ridiculous that the exclusives would make their way to Sony.
9318421	9320061	I mean, people ought to know better.
9320561	9322442	Did you have any other topics for us tonight, Spatineer?
9324247	9327591	No, pretty much covers it.
9328371	9329413	I'll probably let you go.
9330114	9333898	I would imagine you probably want to squeeze in one more call and maybe close off afterwards.
9339184	9339864	Alright, here's a good one.
9356434	9359236	Hi, you're on Orange Radio.
9359617	9360017	Who's this?
9360257	9361278	Legend of Zaku.
9361318	9361938	Hopefully now.
9362579	9363739	Yes, we can hear you loud and clear.
9364180	9365461	What's up, Legend of Zaku?
9366461	9372866	Nothing much, just trying to kill another dull weekend aside from the Yanks winning.
9373466	9374327	But yeah, I mean...
9375470	9382454	Um, basically, from what I've been seeing so far, PSP Go has been getting a lot of flack.
9383075	9384456	Most of it's actually deserving.
9385156	9394462	Just for the fact that Sony is just not, they just haven't made it easy for existing PSP owners to give them the incentive to switch on.
9395322	9397544	Especially when transferring existing UMDs.
9398325	9404071	Did you see that story earlier this week where Reggie Fils-Aimé has even come out and said, I don't get the PSP Go, basically?
9405453	9413501	Actually, I think he's right for the fact that, for the most part, every upgrade to the DS allowed people to play their old existing games.
9414282	9419468	So in that sense, Sony's basically going two steps forward, one step back.
9421696	9422997	Actually, no, wait, what am I saying?
9423097	9424818	Two steps backward, one step forward.
9425059	9425519	I like this.
9425779	9426159	That's all right.
9426500	9429942	I like this, what Toagak says in our chat, and I probably horribly mispronounced that name.
9429982	9430463	I apologize.
9430803	9434165	But Toagak says, PSP go equals PSP no.
9435046	9435466	Exactly.
9435526	9437188	I mean, I have my original PSP.
9437288	9440130	I mean, I have my slim PSP, and I love it.
9440350	9443532	You know, I love that thing to death just because I can play UMDs on it.
9444073	9448256	So any new game that's still coming out, at least I have a hard copy of it.
9448376	9450958	That's like something you'd see on a protest sign in a march or something.
9452898	9453499	Sonic the Hedgehog
9470939	9477622	so it doesn't give people that incentive to just impulsively buy that new system.
9478382	9480043	I want to read this comment in chat here real quick.
9480063	9493708	Kitsune in chat says the PSP Go is only for those who don't already have a PSP and I understand that point and I almost would agree with it, almost except I feel like with the PSP Go you get less choice than you have with the PSP 3000.
9493988	9499010	Right, I mean you can't even sell, everything's digital there's no second hand sales of
9505513	9517677	If there was a faster processor, a second analog, something else in here, PS2 capability of games, something else in here I could recommend, I would be all about that.
9518097	9519938	Right, if it was a brand new PSP, a second...
9523519	9529743	A new version of it, a completely new version outside of the fact that there's already been three so far.
9531244	9546615	I mean, that would be more than enough, but if it's more of the same with just like superficial tacked on features like Bluetooth, which should have been in recent PSP iterations already, it just feels like Sony's like, you know, they're fucking up.
9547856	9557364	You're preaching to the choir here and it's tough because we want to give Sony credit for the things they're doing right on the PlayStation 3, but then you can't turn the blind eye to go.
9557424	9570234	But the PSP, they're just acting like a bunch of chickens with their heads cut off because they don't even know how to make a product that not only new people would want, but the existing base.
9570274	9572496	If you can't woo them, then that thing is dead in the water.
9573690	9574050	I agree.
9574710	9575891	What else is on your mind tonight, Zaku?
9577452	9587400	Nothing much, except for the fact that a few weeks ago I did attend an old-timers DDR tournament on the break, even though I didn't compete.
9587960	9592664	It was basically a 32-man mixed tournament that took hours to complete.
9593823	9597444	So that was the other highlight of these past few weeks.
9598084	9600445	Eight on the breaks, a good arcade.
9600865	9604186	I've been there, of course, and I haven't been there in a few years.
9605486	9607066	Well, they put FitMix already.
9607126	9608287	They've been having that for months.
9608427	9614208	And during Kings of the Coast, their big tournament in August, they were running a 4th Mix Plus tournament.
9614228	9616749	So, yeah, they're really throwing it back over there.
9616949	9622376	My love for 8 on the Break isn't just with the music games, but the fact that I didn't feel like the place was overrun with redemption games.
9622696	9624799	Not only that, it's like cheap food.
9624819	9626902	$4 would pretty much fill your stomach.
9628584	9631367	Good point, although I wouldn't want to live on that food, if you know what I mean.
9632648	9633069	All right.
9633849	9637191	Zachu, we're going to let you go to try and maybe squeeze in one more call, but thank you so much for the call.
9637251	9637591	Okay, buddy?
9637611	9638412	All right.
9638432	9638832	Have a good one.
9638872	9639392	Go Yankees.
9640213	9640473	Yes.
9641213	9643815	I always say that because my coworker loves the – I don't follow baseball.
9643875	9649738	My coworker loves the Yankees, so I know that if the Yankees win, it's going to be a good day at work tomorrow because people will be happy.
9650178	9653080	So actually I think that's going to do it for the Skype line tonight.
9653120	9657823	So sorry to those that didn't get through, but you can always send us an email to mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com.
9658143	9658363	PXP MP5
9683457	9689264	And I had to laugh though because some of the specs on it, like it had a built-in camera, it could play emulation games and stuff like that.
9689284	9691726	I'm like, wow, that's already better than the PSP Go.
9692868	9696912	But yeah, I would imagine the camera's pretty low quality and all that stuff.
9696972	9698434	It is a lot cheaper though, but...
9699366	9702768	It'll be interesting to see how much it actually sells.
9702868	9709092	And I don't even know if we'll be able to tell that because it's going to be the PlayStation portable platform and not necessarily the PSP Go.
9709192	9713234	But yeah, I bet you it's going to just slump off to nothing by the time the holiday comes around.
9713534	9716136	Are you able to figure out the real sales figures for PSP Go?
9716829	9717269	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
9744720	9746563	I want frozen yogurt, but I'm not going to have any.
9765106	9765366	Frozen Yogurt
9778953	9779893	Did you win last?
9779933	9780394	I don't remember.
9780414	9782594	I didn't win anything because my song was all fucked up.
9782774	9783775	We'll talk about it during Afterbirth.
9784395	9786276	Loki, your final thought tonight.
9786876	9792078	I need to move the cabinet into the house and then the next project is to rebuild the DDR pads.
9792478	9794078	I already have them designed and everything.
9794579	9795519	They're going to be awesome.
9797243	9818765	my final thought for the day is happy national coming out day and equality for all means just that equal rights for all equal equal equal there is no such thing as a domestic partnership being equal rights in any way shape or form I had one of my friends actually it's funny that you mentioned that last weekend he came up and stuff he came out to me he's been apparently married
9819506	9820927	He got married during that time, too.
9821848	9823569	That it was legal.
9824510	9825370	Oh, as part of the 18,000.
9825831	9829473	Oh, I thought you meant this was like a married man to a woman who came out to you.
9829493	9830534	Because that could be very difficult.
9831154	9832575	I've met men who have gone through that.
9832615	9833396	No, no, no.
9833796	9834637	No idea whatsoever.
9834997	9837339	But he's had a boyfriend ever since.
9837439	9841802	Even during when he came to our wedding and stuff.
9841962	9842663	You've actually met him.
9843683	9843823	But...
9845004	9846385	I was like, why didn't you bring him?
9846465	9848026	I'm like, that would have been okay.
9848166	9850327	But he's not coming out there but yet.
9850447	9852849	I met a lot of people at your wedding, so I probably wouldn't remember him.
9852889	9854530	But props.
9855650	9860933	California is the only state where some marriages are legal and they don't know how to explain how it works.
9861013	9862554	Let me give you a hint, California.
9862594	9863255	Here's how to get it right.
9863795	9866957	Equal, equal, equal across the board.
9866997	9867617	That's how you do it.
9868218	9869999	There's no reason for it.
9870959	9874121	No religious text should ever take away equality.
9874521	9874701	Ever.
9875541	9875681	So.
9876182	9876442	Anyhow.
9877202	9877442	That's it.
9877462	9878423	I'll get off my soapbox now.
9879183	9881044	That's going to do it for another episode of Orange Launch Radio.
9881084	9882364	Thank you guys so much for tuning in to us.
9882404	9885506	We had a really good listener count tonight, especially considering we've been off for a week.
9885906	9886906	So that must mean you missed us.
9887067	9887787	So thank you very much.
9887927	9890588	And you don't hate us too much for falling behind on the podcast feed and all that stuff.

9934891	9938994	Help spread by word of mouth, because remember, that's all we've got to promote Orange Lounge Radio.
9939274	9944017	We don't have any fancy magazines or big million hits a month website to back us up.
9944338	9947019	We only have you guys to help spread the word.
9947079	9947980	So that's it.
