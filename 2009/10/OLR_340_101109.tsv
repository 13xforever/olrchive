7000	12000	With your hosts, DarkSakura, Sky and Loco
14000	19000	Tonight, October 11th, 2009, Epic Mickey is confirmed this week as a real game.
19000	23000	Could you soon see the Wii Balance Board used in airport security?
23000	27000	And the Commodore 64 Classic is set for a new revival.
27000	30000	Orange Lounge Radio
31000	37000	Hello everybody out there on the internet, on their iPods, on allgames.com or however you're listening to our show.
37000	40000	Welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
40000	46000	We are that show dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture and the gamer lifestyle.
46000	49000	We like to think of ourselves as the show where every gamer has a voice.
49000	52000	With you here every week is myself, Rob Roberts.
52000	56000	And joining me as always, say hello to the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.
56000	57000	You.
57000	58000	How are you doing, DarkSakura?
58000	59000	I'm doing.
59000	60000	Good, good to hear.
60000	62000	Yeah, and guess what?
62000	63000	What?
63000	64000	I don't have to work tomorrow.
64000	65000	Lucky you.
65000	67000	Who celebrates Columbus Day anymore?
67000	68000	Banks, apparently.
68000	69000	Colombians.
69000	73000	Alright, anyway, also joining us, say hello to TechMaster, Loki.
73000	74000	Hello.
74000	75000	How you doing, Loki?
75000	76000	I'm doing good.
76000	77000	Awesome.
77000	79000	How was your couple weeks off?
79000	82000	Because you missed the show, the mini show we did.
82000	84000	We talked about that before.
84000	86000	That I guess you just kind of spaced it on Tuesday.
86000	87000	I forgot.
87000	88000	Yeah, right.
88000	90000	I had crap going on on Tuesday, so I forgot all about it.
90000	93000	So we pre-recorded so that, you know, because it's been weird.
93000	96000	We've missed a couple weeks, and that's all my fault, I apologize.
96000	101000	But we pre-recorded a show for last week, and Loki, you just kind of didn't come.
101000	102000	Yeah, I spaced.
102000	104000	You were better than that show.
104000	105000	Sorry.
105000	109000	What did you get done last Saturday, or last Sunday in Absence of Orange on radio?
109000	111000	I put in sprinklers.
111000	112000	Yeah?
112000	113000	Yeah, that was not fun.
113000	114000	But it's done?
114000	115000	Do they work?
115000	116000	Yeah, it's done.
116000	117000	They work.
117000	118000	Good, because our sprinklers need fixing.
118000	121000	I just have to bury them, which I haven't...
121000	123000	I finished most of it.
123000	127000	There's a part by the valves at the bury and the side yard at the bury.
127000	128000	Gotcha.
128000	129000	But I haven't really...
129000	130000	I don't know.
130000	131000	I need...
131000	134000	Because, you know, when you're digging that stuff out, especially if you dig it out onto
134000	139000	grass and stuff like that, you end up losing some of the dirt because you just can't scrape
139000	141000	all of it out of the grass.
141000	145000	So there's like big divots where all the pipes are.
145000	149000	And at the same time, we also chop through the cable line, which is fun.
149000	151000	So we had to fix that too.
151000	153000	But, yeah, they went in.
153000	154000	They work.
154000	158000	I ran them today trying to flush out the water because now our water out of our fridge tastes
158000	159000	like crap.
159000	161000	Well, you know, city water.
161000	163000	That's what it tastes like.
163000	168000	So, you know, we need to flush out the water out of the pipes and stuff and get it all
168000	171000	clean, and then everything will be fine.
171000	172000	All right.
172000	173000	Well, it's really good to be back.
173000	176000	Let me just tell you guys because honestly, and I was commenting to Dark Sakura before
176000	179000	we started tonight's show, it feels like we've been gone for like a year.
179000	183000	I don't know what it is about having missed a couple of shows here and there, but I just
183000	187000	want to reassure everybody, we are set to go through the rest of 2009.
187000	189000	No foreseeable vacations.
189000	192000	I mean, of course, you know, things are going to happen, who knows what.
192000	194000	But no foreseeable vacations for the rest of the year.
194000	196000	We're here with you guys.
196000	201000	And podcast feed should be all good again soon, very soon.
201000	206000	We've got the episode from a few weeks ago up and getting that all caught up, so we'll
206000	208000	be good to go very soon.
208000	209000	So let's get back into it.
209000	212000	How was your gaming week is how we always start off the show.
212000	214000	Dark Sakura, how was your gaming week?
214000	215000	Not very.
215000	216000	Yeah, really?
216000	221000	Well, I sat around watching Dan play through Shadow Complex, which is pretty cool.
221000	228000	And I don't know, I didn't play too much myself, except I didn't even play any Sims.
228000	230000	I was just, meh.
230000	231000	But wait a minute.
231000	234000	I played Peggle.
234000	235000	Well, hold on a minute.
235000	236000	Rewind a minute.
236000	239000	Because you were telling me before the show started tonight, and I even noticed the background
239000	240000	on your computer.
240000	241000	It's a game I want.
241000	242000	I didn't play it.
242000	244000	Oh, I thought it was something you were watching Dan play.
244000	248000	No, we were watching a comparison for Bayonetta.
248000	253000	We were watching an Xbox 360 and PS3 side-by-side comparison.
253000	256000	PS3 version looks like shit.
256000	259000	Yeah, they're really distancing themselves from it.
259000	260000	It's awful.
260000	261000	Oh, the bunnies are out.
261000	262000	Interesting.
262000	263000	Rob, look out the window.
263000	265000	Yeah, I saw them last week.
265000	266000	Bunnies?
266000	267000	In the neighbor's yard.
267000	268000	Wow.
268000	269000	Sorry.
269000	271000	I heard a rooster earlier, and now bunnies.
271000	273000	Are we out on a farm today or something?
273000	277000	Well, our neighbors across the street, they let their bunnies run wild all over the neighborhood.
277000	279000	And they usually like to hang out in my yard.
279000	282000	So, we have stray bunnies.
282000	283000	Gotcha.
283000	284000	And not stray dogs or cats.
284000	285000	We have stray bunnies.
285000	288000	You been watching Dan play more ODST?
288000	291000	That game makes me motion sick, and I don't really care for it.
291000	292000	Gotcha.
292000	295000	I'm like, ugh, turn off this loud piece of crap.
295000	300000	But Dan loves it, so if he's having fun with it, then he can have fun, just not when I'm
300000	301000	trying to go to bed.
301000	304000	And just for folks who are newer to the show who may not know, you've never been a fan
304000	307000	of first-person shooters, because they just make you ill.
307000	310000	Well, I'd like them before they used 3D.
310000	312000	When they were sprite-based, great.
312000	314000	Like Wolfenstein was fine, right?
314000	317000	Yeah, and Doom.
317000	318000	Alright.
318000	319000	Well, let's move on.
319000	320000	Loki, how was your gaming week?
320000	323000	My gaming week was pretty good, I guess.
323000	329000	I played more Grand Theft Auto, Lost and Damned, where I'm up to almost rank 5.
329000	335000	I would have been ranked 5 on Friday, but I dropped out of one of my games.
335000	341000	And I had to go on some manager special event thing or something, so I went to a zoo instead.
341000	348000	But no, I'm like $500 away from rank 5, which means I get more heads, as my coworker likes
348000	349000	to put it.
349000	354000	And it's just killing time for a couple more weeks until Ballad of Gay Tony comes out,
354000	356000	and that'll be awesome.
356000	360000	And then, what was it, my sister's 360 died, so now...
360000	366000	And it's funny, hers died the same way as my last one did, where it basically lost its
366000	372000	graphics processor, got like a green tint to it, and then the whole thing, just no video
372000	374000	anymore, so that kind of sucked.
374000	378000	There's no real way to fix that, and obviously it's not under warranty since hers is modded
378000	380000	as well, so that doesn't work.
380000	384000	But we have a way to remedy that soon enough.
384000	394000	And then I played some DJ Hero, I have a demo unit that I got, and I've been playing the
394000	399000	four songs that are on there, well three technically in the set, and then there's a fourth one
399000	407000	which is like a DJ versus guitar song in there, which I didn't really play that much of because
407000	409000	not a lot of people wanted to play guitar.
409000	417000	And then, been having a lot of fun with that, you know, the controller's pretty nice, although
417000	422000	since it is a demo unit, it's wired and wireless, which is fine, I don't really give a crap,
422000	425000	because I hate replacing batteries anyways.
425000	429000	And the only thing that sucks about those, you can't flip it because the way the cord
429000	435000	comes out, it actually would be in the way if you flipped it to the left-handed, I guess
435000	440000	lefty side, although for me, I don't really care because I'm right-handed, but my coworker
440000	445000	wasn't, and he wanted to really try it, and I'm like, dude, sorry, can't, so he had to
445000	446000	play cross-handed.
446000	450000	Tell us a little bit, because you know, obviously Orange Highlands Radio started as a music
450000	455000	game thing, and on our very first episode of Orange Highlands Radio, we had people in
455000	460000	house playing BeatMania 2DX, so it's very interesting now coming here seven and a half
460000	463000	years later, now we're going to have people in the studio playing DJ Hero tonight.
463000	470000	How do the two games compare, if at all, what are Bomani fans going to think of DJ Hero?
470000	475000	They may not like it, because it's nothing like 2DX, it's more like Guitar Hero, I mean
475000	480000	it's just like the comparison of 2DX and Guitar Hero, they're really not similar at all,
480000	484000	I mean other than you have notes coming down the screen, but that's about it.
484000	492000	The scratching in the game is almost like strumming on the guitar a little bit, and
492000	499000	then the crossfader, it's a lot of, I mean, when you start playing it, it's a lot to
499000	506000	kind of take all in, but then you get used to it, and it can be hard to juggle the crossfader
506000	512000	and the keys and all that stuff sometimes, but it's fun, and I don't know, I enjoy
512000	518000	the game a lot, there's some songs I saw on the full track list I'm not too excited
518000	522000	about, I mean there's especially a lot of songs that are just kind of repeats as far
522000	525000	as what they've used to mix them together, but you know what, I think it'll actually
525000	532000	sound very different, just like I've listened to the two Shout remixes, and they're completely
532000	538000	different, it's just, it's going to be fun, definitely, and as far as playing it, it's
538000	542000	pretty easy to kind of pick up and start, but if you're good at Guitar Hero, I mean
542000	546000	you're still going to have trouble with it, because I had a friend who's, you know,
546000	551000	he can expert almost all the songs in Guitar Hero, and he was struggling just to kind of
551000	556000	get DJ Hero down, but it's kind of a new learning curve, but you'll pick it up pretty
556000	561000	quick, I mean, just from watching the videos, I started off playing Medium, and I picked
561000	565000	it up pretty quick, I kind of want to try hard, I haven't gotten a chance to do that
565000	570000	yet, because also the demo too kind of sucks, because you can't calibrate it, because
570000	577000	it is a demo, and so on the TV we're playing, there's some lag, and so trying to fix that,
577000	579000	you know, you kind of have to compensate for it.
579000	581000	But in the full version, you will be able to get it.
581000	583000	Yeah, in the full version, they'll have all that stuff, it's just, you know, because
583000	587000	it's just a basic demo, they don't have that built in.
587000	590000	Now, this game's going to cost $130, right?
590000	594000	$120, sorry, I think it's $120.
594000	595000	Well, after tax, $130.
595000	596000	$130, yeah.
596000	600000	Let's be real, so this game's going to set you back about $130.
600000	605000	Who should drop, I mean, that's a big investment, I mean, for $70 more you can buy a console,
605000	609000	for $20 more you can buy a Wii, that's as much as a Nintendo DS.
609000	611000	Who should drop $130 on this game?
611000	613000	Who should not drop $130 on this game?
613000	617000	I think if you like music games, you should drop the money, I mean, but the thing is,
617000	621000	you can go to Source now, I mean, Best Buy, I know some Best Buys have this demo unit
621000	625000	set up, I'm sure a lot of them will be getting it if they don't have it yet, GameStop did
625000	628000	a thing this weekend where their stores had a demo unit in-house.
628000	629000	Dark Sakura?
629000	633000	I was going to say, don't drop the money on this game if you're on food stamps.
633000	638000	Well, duh, Dark Sakura, I mean, yeah, if it's not in your budget, then it's not in your
638000	641000	budget, but I mean, if, you know, you're debating.
641000	647000	Yeah, and the other thing you've got to understand is, unlike, you know, Guitar Hero and Rockband,
647000	652000	this controller's only going to work with, you know, this game.
652000	653000	So far?
653000	657000	So far, I mean, it's not going to work, you know, Harmonix is not going to come out with
657000	661000	a DJ game that's going to be exactly like this, and so, you're not going to have, you
661000	667000	know, uniformity that way, so, you know, you've got to be really willing to stick to this
667000	671000	series, and you know what, I, after playing the three songs in there, I'm fine with dropping
671000	677000	the money, and I'll be honest, you know, I know a lot of people frown upon buying demos,
677000	682000	but yes, I bought this demo unit, and yes, it's the same one that you saw on Destructoid,
682000	687000	I bought that unit, I paid the money to buy it, and yeah, I know it's retarded, but I
687000	693000	had nefarious intentions, trust me, originally, but having played it, I probably am going
693000	698000	to buy the full game, only because I can get it early, and that's really why I'm excited
698000	703000	to play this game, but if I wanted to, I could, you know, pirate it, but I'm not going to,
703000	706000	because I won't play it early.
706000	710000	I wasn't going to say anything about how you got this game, because most people would assume
710000	712000	you get it through your work channels, but...
712000	714000	No, no, my work doesn't hook me up for crap.
714000	719000	What possessed you to drop that money on it?
719000	722000	Because I wanted to play it.
722000	727000	Because I'm impatient, and because I figured, I figured, hey, you know what, I can drop
727000	733000	the money on this demo unit, and the controller works just fine, and you know what, I have
733000	739000	the means to play modded games on my console, so if I really want to not spend the money,
739000	740000	I can do that.
740000	745000	Only you can tell you how to spend your money, and the wife now, because that's part of the
745000	748000	whole marriage thing, but hopefully she liked it too.
748000	753000	She hasn't really seen it, she's just like, I don't know, she laughed because Hollaback
753000	758000	Roll is in there, in the demo, but I don't care, you know, because if I don't want to
758000	764000	buy the game, I can still play the game, technically, but I'm not condoning piracy or anything,
764000	768000	and not a lot of people would be pirating this game anyway, since, you know, you need
768000	769000	a controller.
769000	771000	You need a controller for it, yeah.
771000	773000	Alright, let me go to our chat room.
773000	776000	We always have the chat comments here, chat.orangelaungeradio.com.
776000	781000	But for the record, though, I am buying the game on top of this, so I have two controllers,
781000	783000	you know, for party situations and stuff like that.
783000	787000	And, actually, I want to lead into our first chat comment tonight from our chat room that
787000	790000	kind of gets into this a little bit, and our first chat comment tonight comes from our
790000	794000	buddy Derek H., who actually hosts another show here on allgames.com, Dead Pixel Live,
794000	798000	which would technically be the next show on After Orange Launch Radio, just, you have
798000	799000	to wait until Monday.
799000	803000	Derek H. says, "$130, it's catch-22.
803000	807000	To be worth it, you'd need to have a lot of friends, but if you have a lot of friends,
807000	810000	you're not a person who spends $130 on a video game."
810000	813000	I don't know, though, what about, I mean, I get the funny he's trying to make there,
813000	815000	but what about, like, Rock Band?
815000	816000	Rock Band's a party game.
816000	821000	Rock Band, you know, and it's, I don't know, I looked at it, you know, I thought about
821000	823000	it, but I went with it.
823000	825000	I went for it, and you know what, I'm not regretting it.
825000	826000	I like playing it.
826000	829000	But didn't you, it sounds like you had people over to play this game.
829000	833000	Well, I work, yeah, we checked it out and stuff like that, and, you know, I had it hooked
833000	840000	up for an entire day and that kind of thing, but, yeah, it's fun, and I am looking forward
840000	847000	to, and really, I could, I could just skip paying the extra $200, or $100, I'm not buying
847000	851000	the Renegade Edition, that's for sure, because I have a bag to carry this, you know, system
851000	856000	in, and you know what, I don't really need a table to play it on, because I played it
856000	861000	in my lap just fine, so don't buy it, especially if you don't like rap music like me.
861000	866000	I'm not really huge into hip hop and rap music, so, not for me.
866000	872000	But, yeah, I am playing and picking it up, because I'm hoping I get it about a week or
872000	874000	two early, so.
874000	877000	So there, now your day job comes into play.
877000	879000	Yeah, that's where it comes in.
879000	881000	So don't say they don't do crap, because you've got lots of games that way.
881000	884000	Yeah, but they don't give it to me for free, and I have to buy that crap.
884000	886000	All right, fair enough.
886000	888000	All right, so that was your gaming week.
888000	891000	All right, we spent a lot of time talking about DJ Hero, but hey, the game's not out
891000	892000	for, what, two weeks?
892000	897000	Yeah, and it's 27th, I also want to say I finished my cabinet almost, I've been working
897000	904000	on that constantly since I've gotten it, and just today, around 3 o'clock, I finished
904000	908000	putting it all back together and everything, and, you know, played a little bit of New
908000	910000	Mario on there, and it works awesome.
910000	917000	It's just, I have everything done except for I need to modify the kick harness on there
917000	923000	to hook up to what I've got for MAME, and then also have to get two new locks for under
923000	931000	the control panel, because the ones I bought are too short, and then also need to move
931000	932000	it in the house.
932000	937000	Oh, and install Windows and stuff onto my actual PC, because I actually had to custom
937000	943000	build the PC to mount it on this piece of wood and stuff, so I actually made my own
943000	945000	power buttons and stuff like that.
945000	946000	It's ridiculous.
946000	950000	But I have pictures online, and there's pictures posted in chat.
950000	951000	Look at that.
951000	955000	Within seconds, Tiger Claw and SSA100MAT have pictures up.
955000	959000	It's pretty, it looks prettier in the picture than it does in real life, but yeah, all the
959000	960000	buttons have been replaced.
960000	961000	Wait, so you just posted these today?
961000	962000	I just posted them this afternoon.
962000	963000	Oh, I haven't seen this yet.
963000	965000	I haven't checked live during the day, so I haven't seen it.
965000	967000	I painted it black, and it looks awesome.
967000	968000	Wow.
968000	969000	Yeah, it's slick.
969000	970000	Nice.
970000	975000	So you can see there, I had to drill three more holes for additional buttons, and then
975000	978000	if you scroll all the way to the bottom there, you can see-
978000	980000	Why did you make a mess of your garage?
980000	982000	Oh, the garage is a mess, yeah.
982000	984000	I remember when you moved in, that was pristine.
984000	985000	Okay, sorry.
985000	986000	I just, no.
986000	988000	So I had to drill new buttons, but that's the PC right there.
988000	991000	It's a huge, but it's all mounted to a piece of wood.
991000	994000	I had to make custom buttons and stuff like that.
994000	997000	I will post this to our Twitter feed if you're okay with that.
997000	998000	Oh, I'm fine.
998000	1000000	I already posted a link to my Twitter.
1000000	1004000	Folks listening on the podcast can go back and check that out if they want to see it.
1004000	1005000	Very cool.
1005000	1006000	Some questions from chat.
1006000	1009000	Tigerclaw wants to know, so you mounted a motherboard to it.
1009000	1010000	What about cooling?
1010000	1012000	Are there any vents on the back, an extra amount of fans?
1012000	1014000	No, I don't think that I really need all that stuff.
1014000	1018000	I mean, the cabinet's pretty open in the inside anyways.
1018000	1022000	I mean, there's a fan on the processor, fan on the graphics card, but I don't think it's
1022000	1025000	going to get too hot because I'm really not...
1025000	1029000	I mean, MAME, I don't think it's going to strain that processor too much.
1029000	1030000	So we'll see.
1030000	1033000	If I need to put a fan in there, I can.
1033000	1035000	But, I mean, I don't know.
1035000	1037000	I don't think it needs it.
1037000	1039000	I think it'll be fine.
1039000	1041000	But we'll play it by ear, you know.
1041000	1042000	All right.
1042000	1043000	I just put that on the Twitter, by the way.
1043000	1044000	So there you go.
1044000	1046000	Anything else, Loki?
1046000	1047000	That's it.
1047000	1048000	All right.
1048000	1049000	My gaming week.
1049000	1050000	I've actually had some time to play some games this week.
1050000	1053000	I just want to point this out, and I know I'm going to get criticized by a lot of folks.
1053000	1056000	I still haven't fixed the 360.
1056000	1058000	I kind of don't need to right now.
1058000	1063000	I've totally been happy in my gaming world with World of Warcraft, of course, and PlayStation
1063000	1064000	3.
1064000	1070000	I hate to admit it because we've been so critical of Sony for a long time, but when Sony does
1070000	1073000	things right, I think we should admit when they've done things right.
1073000	1077000	And I think this price drop was really the right thing, and it could have happened a
1077000	1079000	long time ago, granted.
1079000	1081000	And I think PS3 is moving in a pretty good direction.
1081000	1088000	And one reason why I'm saying that is because finally we got another really good PlayStation
1088000	1091000	3 exclusive game this week, and that's one of the games I've been playing this week,
1091000	1094000	is Demon's Souls.
1094000	1095000	Here's the thing, though.
1095000	1097000	Demon's Souls is not for everybody.
1097000	1099000	It's, from what I hear, it is hard.
1099000	1102000	I've dropped probably four or five hours in this game.
1102000	1104000	I've rolled three different characters.
1104000	1108000	I've beaten the tutorial level, and I consistently get my ass handed to me in the first level.
1108000	1110000	It is that hard of a game.
1110000	1116000	This game is the Mega Man 9 of role-playing games, although I don't want to think role-playing
1116000	1121000	games as like Final Fantasy role-playing game because it's more of an action-y RPG.
1121000	1124000	Think a little more like Oblivion in the third person.
1124000	1128000	This game is so hardcore, it's like D&D.
1128000	1130000	I mean, you have to consider everything.
1130000	1134000	You have to consider the weights of the weapons you're carrying, all these different statistics.
1134000	1135000	There's no pause.
1135000	1137000	There is no pause in this game.
1137000	1140000	There is no pause in this game because the game's online.
1140000	1142000	And this is the interesting thing.
1142000	1146000	This is the part that makes Demon's Souls fascinating is the online component because
1146000	1148000	it's not an MMO.
1148000	1150000	It's not a single-player role-playing game.
1150000	1153000	Let me give you an idea of the types of stuff you do in this game.
1153000	1157000	You can leave markings on the ground that have little messages for other people,
1157000	1159000	but you can't type in your own messages.
1159000	1160000	Sorry, Loki.
1160000	1164000	You have to choose from like a predetermined set that kind of works like a mad lib.
1164000	1168000	In other words, you can put down a sentence that says, beware of blank ahead.
1168000	1170000	And then the next screen would say, what do you want to be in the blank?
1170000	1173000	Enemies, gold, trap, what do you want it to say?
1173000	1178000	So you put these mad lib-ish type warnings down, and then people can rate these messages up.
1178000	1181000	And if they get rated up, your character gets healed.
1181000	1183000	You might suddenly see a message pop on your screen.
1183000	1187000	Your message has been rated up, and you get a little bit of life point back,
1187000	1191000	which is good because otherwise you can't really get it back very easily.
1191000	1195000	And then if it sucks, well, your message just never shows up in other people's worlds.
1195000	1198000	The less it gets rated, the less it just goes away.
1198000	1200000	The other component is that you'll have blood stains.
1200000	1203000	When people die in the world, their blood stain appears,
1203000	1206000	and you can touch the blood stain and watch how they die.
1206000	1207000	That's awesome.
1207000	1208000	Which is kind of interesting.
1208000	1214000	It helps you learn lessons because there's little surprises around every corner and all this stuff.
1214000	1216000	So here's the thing, though.
1216000	1218000	Here's how unforgiving the game is.
1218000	1220000	The currency of the game is souls.
1220000	1222000	Souls by beating monsters.
1222000	1226000	If you die in a level, you go all the way back to start.
1226000	1233000	You lose all your souls, all of them, and the whole level starts over.
1233000	1239000	If you can get back to where your blood stain was and touch it, you get all your souls back.
1239000	1241000	If you die again, you're fucked.
1241000	1242000	It's gone.
1242000	1244000	You lose everything.
1244000	1246000	This game is not messing around.
1246000	1249000	It is a very, very difficult game.
1249000	1252000	When I say it is the Mega Man 9 of role-playing games, I'm not kidding.
1252000	1253000	You know how Mega Man 9 is?
1253000	1259000	You have to go in, you have to die, die, die, and learn a distinct pattern in how to beat the level.
1259000	1263000	Once you learn the pattern to beat the level, it's never a problem again.
1263000	1265000	That's very similar to what this game is.
1265000	1267000	As I'm going through the level,
1267000	1268000	oh, demon hiding behind the wood,
1268000	1270000	oh, demon hiding around the corner,
1270000	1271000	oh, two demons over here,
1271000	1273000	you start to learn the patterns.
1273000	1278000	It just is difficult still for me because a lot of it has to do with timing.
1278000	1281000	If you want to beat really hard enemies, you have to be able to block
1281000	1285000	and then basically jab your sword into the enemy.
1285000	1287000	It gets really hard.
1287000	1292000	I'm just saying this game is not fucking around with the difficulty.
1292000	1297000	If you think you're going to throw a controller across the room, you probably will.
1297000	1301000	That's where you might need to decide if this game is worth dropping $60 on or not
1301000	1307000	because I think the challenge is this game's biggest asset and it's game's biggest drawback.
1307000	1313000	I usually don't go on and read internet reviews of games before I review it myself
1313000	1316000	because I'm afraid I'm going to steal things from reviews,
1316000	1317000	but I had to do it this way.
1317000	1320000	It just indirectly might say something that I read in a review,
1320000	1322000	but I have to repeat this.
1322000	1323000	This was on a review somewhere.
1323000	1327000	It is the anti-casual game, I think is the perfect way to describe this game.
1327000	1329000	It is the anti-casual game.
1329000	1331000	It's R-Type.
1331000	1333000	Is it a rewarding experience though?
1333000	1338000	Heck yeah because it feels really good when you are able to successfully beat a level
1338000	1340000	and get past a point you've never got before.
1340000	1344000	That's a reward you haven't really seen since 8-bit gaming days.
1344000	1346000	One other thing I do want to say about online mode.
1346000	1348000	I haven't gotten to this part myself,
1348000	1352000	but apparently this gets in later on after you beat the first couple levels
1352000	1357000	is that when you die or I guess some of the stains on the floor
1357000	1361000	start being that you can warp yourself into someone else's world
1361000	1363000	and help them beat the boss,
1363000	1368000	or you can go into someone else's world as a black phantom and try to kill them.
1368000	1371000	So now you can be the enemy in someone else's world.
1371000	1372000	That's awesome.
1372000	1374000	And you get rewarded if you kill the other player.
1374000	1375000	But here's the other thing to keep in mind.
1375000	1377000	There is no friends list in this game.
1377000	1379000	There is no voice chat in the game.
1379000	1381000	It is all anonymous.
1381000	1383000	So when you're the black phantom, you're a silent killer.
1383000	1386000	They don't even know who killed them.
1386000	1388000	That sounds like fun.
1388000	1392000	The tricky thing about being the phantom is that if you're just out there,
1392000	1395000	I think they purposely make the phantoms a little weaker,
1395000	1398000	but if you know the levels, if you've really worked at the levels,
1398000	1401000	and you kind of know the good hiding spaces like around corners and stuff,
1401000	1405000	you can just beat the shit out of somebody that you storm in their level.
1405000	1406000	That's awesome.
1406000	1408000	Loki, I think you would sit there all day
1408000	1411000	and be the black phantom on people's levels and have fun with it.
1411000	1415000	You should see me play Grand Theft Auto, man.
1415000	1418000	What we've been doing now where we have random people coming into our games,
1418000	1420000	because we do ranked games now,
1420000	1423000	so basically if you sign on to a ranked game when we're online playing a ranked game
1423000	1426000	or in the lobby, you will be in our ranked game.
1426000	1429000	And then I will mock you on our end,
1429000	1434000	because no one realizes that all five of us or four of us are in the same room.
1434000	1436000	So we'll be like, okay, he's coming around the corner.
1436000	1437000	Boom!
1437000	1440000	Just knock the guy down and we'll kind of not really gang up on them,
1440000	1443000	but we'll help each other.
1443000	1446000	Oh, man, I talk shit when other people are in there.
1446000	1447000	It's awesome.
1447000	1449000	Going to some comments from our chat, chat.orangelandsradio.com,
1449000	1453000	Kitsune says, by that means, they can come into your world and kill you.
1453000	1454000	Yes, they can.
1454000	1457000	I am told the game warns you when a black phantom has entered your level,
1457000	1460000	but it doesn't tell you anything beyond that.
1460000	1463000	And let's see, Hitstun says, this sounds awesome.
1463000	1465000	Too bad it's a PS3 exclusive.
1465000	1466000	That's actually my point, Hitstun.
1466000	1469000	That's why I said kind of before I went into this story,
1469000	1473000	Sony's finally gaining some ground moving into this holiday season.
1473000	1477000	Sony PS3 has had some great exclusives.
1477000	1479000	For the platformers, they have LittleBigPlanet.
1479000	1481000	For the first-person shooters, they have Resistance.
1481000	1485000	Now they have something for the action RPGers, and that's Demon's Souls.
1485000	1487000	And to some extent, you could say Valkyria Chronicles 2,
1487000	1492000	although that's more of a, you know, why can't I think of the name all of a sudden?
1492000	1493000	Real?
1493000	1494000	The strategy, RTS game.
1494000	1495000	Thank you.
1495000	1497000	Leo Shen wants to know how far did I get.
1497000	1500000	Dude, I can't even beat Voltaria Palace 1-1.
1500000	1502000	That's how hard this game is.
1502000	1506000	Like, I keep getting killed by the blue-eyed guy.
1506000	1507000	But I'm trying.
1507000	1510000	I just, I keep rerolling characters to think it can,
1510000	1515000	I actually hear the easiest way through it is with the royalty character,
1515000	1517000	because even though they start at the lowest level, they have the soul arrow,
1517000	1519000	so that's what I'm trying to do now.
1519000	1521000	But I'm finding it makes you really weak.
1521000	1524000	So I got gang raped by two fire-wielding guys.
1524000	1527000	I can't even get back to where I was with my soldier.
1527000	1531000	Anyhow, Demon's Souls is the name of the game.
1531000	1534000	One other game I do want to mention that I played, another PS3 exclusive,
1534000	1537000	go figure, Katamari Forever on the PlayStation 3.
1537000	1539000	I did pick up this week, finally.
1539000	1540000	It's a little cheaper than Demon's Souls.
1540000	1542000	Demon's Souls set me back 60.
1542000	1545000	I believe Katamari Forever was 49.99 or 50.
1545000	1546000	Yeah, 40.
1546000	1549000	So it's a little cheaper, but you know what?
1549000	1552000	I had more fun playing this than I did the Xbox 360 version,
1552000	1553000	beautiful Katamari.
1553000	1555000	I don't know why.
1555000	1556000	I'm not trying to hate on 360.
1556000	1560000	I do miss my 360, and I will be getting it fixed soon
1560000	1566000	when I finally can't resist anymore wanting to play Beatles Rock Band
1566000	1568000	and some of the other online games I've been missing out on
1568000	1571000	while my 360 has been broken.
1571000	1573000	But I will say Katamari Forever is really cool.
1573000	1574000	I love the way it controls.
1574000	1577000	The music is cute, having it back in the levels.
1577000	1580000	I have to admit, I haven't fully explored the game,
1580000	1582000	because I've been kind of a little busy playing Demon's Souls
1582000	1583000	and killing in that game.
1583000	1588000	But I'm already having more fun with this than I was the 360 version of the game,
1588000	1592000	even though this admittedly is a rehash of a lot of the levels.
1592000	1595000	But what I like is that they do put new elements in the levels.
1595000	1599000	You can go back and play the old levels as the old levels if you want.
1599000	1601000	And to be honest, I haven't played the game in so long
1601000	1604000	that all the levels are feeling new to me again
1604000	1606000	after two, three years of not playing it.
1606000	1609000	But I do think the price point may be a little high
1609000	1612000	considering that a lot of it is recycled.
1612000	1615000	If you've never played Katamari Damacy before, though,
1615000	1617000	this is a really good entry-level game.
1617000	1621000	If you have all the other games, you might want to wait for a price drop.
1621000	1623000	I just think for a lot of folks, 50 bucks,
1623000	1625000	unless you're a hardcore fan of the series,
1625000	1627000	you're going to be like, come on, too much.
1627000	1630000	So there you go.
1630000	1633000	All right, so that was pretty much my gaming week.
1633000	1636000	I did play some other stuff, but I've talked too much about the other games.
1636000	1638000	I want to get into some gaming news.
1638000	1639000	I know you guys do, too.
1639000	1640000	We're going to get into it.
1640000	1642000	First off, some housekeeping real quick.
1642000	1644000	The podcast feed is behind.
1644000	1647000	I'm sorry about that, but vacations will do that.
1647000	1651000	I did get 338 on the feed tonight, so all that's left is 339 in the mini show.
1651000	1654000	So those will go up this week before this week's show does.
1654000	1659000	So part of the problem was that when I was last here at Dark Soccer's house,
1659000	1662000	I didn't upload 339 to our server.
1662000	1664000	I uploaded 329.
1664000	1667000	So I was never going to be able to put up more than what I put up today.
1667000	1670000	So that was my bad, and I'm sorry for being lazy.
1670000	1675000	But vacations happen, so I guess more incentive to tune in live when you can,
1675000	1677000	but I will try to be better for the podcast feed listeners.
1677000	1680000	I know you guys have been kind of pooped on a lot in 2009,
1680000	1682000	so I apologize for that.
1682000	1684000	Anyhow, that's really it.
1684000	1686000	Otherwise, go ahead and add us on Twitter.
1686000	1689000	We are soon going to have a new Facebook fan page.
1689000	1690000	I know we have our Facebook forums,
1690000	1692000	but we're actually going to work on building a fan page
1692000	1696000	so that way we can notify you about new shows in your friend feed
1696000	1697000	if you want.
1697000	1700000	If you don't want it, add us anyway, and then block our updates, whatever.
1700000	1703000	But we're going to actually work on an official Orange Laundry Radio page
1703000	1705000	that will hopefully be open this week.
1705000	1707000	And then, of course, we still have our live journal,
1707000	1709000	our website, orangelaundryradio.com, and so forth.
1709000	1711000	Let's get into some actual gaming news now.
1711000	1714000	Thirty minutes into the show, we can finally talk gaming news.
1714000	1717000	There's been quite a bit in the time we've been gone.
1717000	1719000	Loki, start us off tonight, if you would.
1719000	1721000	Yes, and it's interesting.
1721000	1726000	The game that was kind of teased around, and actually it was pretty sweet
1726000	1728000	from the concept art that was leaked,
1728000	1733000	Epic Mickey has been confirmed via the newest Game Informer.
1733000	1735000	It's on the cover.
1735000	1738000	And, of course, they have the inside story about that as well.
1738000	1741000	The game is being done by War Inspector,
1741000	1744000	and it's actually pretty sweet looking.
1744000	1748000	It takes place kind of in this dark Disney-type world
1748000	1754000	where Mickey will actually be facing up against some forgotten Disney characters
1754000	1757000	who are all really twisted looking.
1757000	1760000	I mean, this stuff is like some Alice McGee type of stuff,
1760000	1764000	but apparently the villain in the game is supposed to be Oswald the Rabbit,
1764000	1769000	who I had no idea who he was, so therefore perfect for this,
1769000	1774000	since it's a character that's been forgotten.
1774000	1777000	Very cool looking game, and right now it's been confirmed
1777000	1783000	to be exclusive for the Wii, but it might actually be coming out later on,
1783000	1784000	maybe on some other platforms.
1784000	1787000	I hope it actually comes out on 360 or PS3,
1787000	1790000	because the visuals that they have right now in the concept art look awesome,
1790000	1793000	and I just don't know if it's going to translate well over to the Wii,
1793000	1796000	but definitely want to play this game.
1796000	1798000	It's a pretty epic looking RPG.
1798000	1802000	Have we seen much outside of the one screenshot that's on the magazine cover?
1802000	1806000	They've had artwork put out from it, and it looks really dark.
1806000	1809000	I'm almost surprised it's even on the Wii.
1809000	1813000	Well, the Wii's kind of needed something like Epic Mickey,
1813000	1815000	so I get it, and I'm going to give it a chance.
1815000	1817000	I think a lot of people are like,
1817000	1822000	boo, this isn't coming to 360 or PS3, it can't be that epic,
1822000	1824000	but I'm saying, wait a minute, give this a chance,
1824000	1828000	because what this game's trying to do is fill a niche that the Wii doesn't have,
1828000	1830000	because the Wii right now is known as a shovelware system
1830000	1834000	with the occasional awesome Metroid or Mario game.
1834000	1836000	That's what the Wii is right now.
1836000	1839000	So, okay, let's give Epic Mickey a chance to fill a void that's needed.
1839000	1842000	So I'm hopeful, even though, yeah, I can't be high def,
1842000	1845000	graphics aren't everything, let's remember that.
1845000	1848000	And right now, the reason why it's on the Wii exclusively
1848000	1853000	is because the control system that's in the game relies on motion controls,
1853000	1858000	and since I don't know when it's going to be coming out,
1858000	1860000	if it's spring next year, it might be too early,
1860000	1863000	maybe they don't have time to work with development kits for Natal,
1863000	1867000	or whatever they're calling the PlayStation 3 motion controller.
1867000	1869000	We'll see more of these games later on.
1869000	1871000	And who's to say that they couldn't, if this is really popular,
1871000	1876000	do a sequel, it'll be on all platforms, or even port this later on.
1876000	1878000	So I wouldn't rule it out, but...
1878000	1880000	Well, here's my thing, though.
1880000	1882000	What's wrong with Kingdom Hearts?
1882000	1885000	I mean, isn't Kingdom Hearts, in a way, epic Mickey?
1885000	1887000	I mean, I realize that games are going to be different.
1887000	1890000	I realize this is not going to be a role-playing game or what have you.
1890000	1893000	I kind of look at this and go, is this going to kill off Kingdom Hearts?
1893000	1895000	Because that's kind of too bad.
1895000	1898000	Because Kingdom Hearts, I always thought, was kind of an epic Mickey.
1898000	1899000	I mean, yeah, I was...
1899000	1901000	I don't think it co-exists.
1901000	1902000	I hope so.
1902000	1906000	But, I mean, there was always those rumors that Kingdom Hearts 3,
1906000	1910000	whenever it actually happens, was going to do away with the Disney.
1910000	1912000	I mean, is that what we're looking at?
1912000	1914000	Now the Disney is over here?
1914000	1918000	I mean, I guess we don't know until we really get some final words on Kingdom Hearts 3.
1918000	1922000	But how much Disney is involved with these handheld Kingdom Hearts games?
1922000	1925000	I've got to admit, I haven't been following the handheld Kingdom Hearts games.
1925000	1926000	Maybe the chat can help.
1926000	1927000	I don't really know.
1927000	1931000	Chatters, how much Disney are in those handheld Kingdom Hearts games?
1931000	1934000	I mean, are they already phasing the Disney out?
1934000	1936000	I'm not really sure.
1936000	1940000	I never played the DS version that just came out, so I don't know.
1940000	1943000	All right, well, granted the games can co-exist,
1943000	1947000	and we can't really rate this game until it's actually out.
1947000	1951000	But I do kind of pose that question, is that, well, isn't Kingdom Hearts, in some extent,
1951000	1953000	kind of an epic Mickey game?
1953000	1957000	And, granted, you can still have Kingdom Hearts co-exist with
1957000	1961000	Happy Birthday Disney Princess or whatever that game is on the Wii.
1961000	1964000	It's not like Kingdom Hearts is the sole only Disney game.
1964000	1967000	And X-Link confirms, yes, there is a lot in the games.
1967000	1971000	So whatever I heard about Disney being phased out is just a sick rumor.
1971000	1976000	Although, I will tell you, being at Disneyland twice in the past month,
1976000	1978000	there isn't a lot of Kingdom Hearts.
1978000	1981000	In fact, there is no Kingdom Hearts references in either park.
1981000	1985000	Which, I understand, because Square Enix, that's really their thing.
1985000	1990000	But you would think it still raises Disney awareness as kind of a bummer.
1990000	1994000	They don't have at least a Sora something to buy.
1994000	1997000	Well, it looks like, though, this game is going to be more like Disney Park stuff
1997000	2001000	because they show, kind of in the concept art here,
2001000	2005000	they have the castle in the background, they've got the Haunted Mansion in there.
2005000	2009000	They also have, you know, it's a small world in there.
2009000	2011000	They've got, you know, the characters.
2011000	2016000	They have, it looks like, it's just, it's going to be awesome.
2016000	2019000	I'm worried that it's going to be too dark and the people are going to be like,
2019000	2023000	oh my god, this is, you know, my kids are going to get nightmares from this, you know.
2023000	2027000	Because some of the creatures that they've shown so far are pretty creepy
2027000	2030000	and for a little kid, it would not be appropriate for them.
2030000	2033000	But is it going to be dark in like a, I mean, let's face it,
2033000	2035000	there's a lot of dark things at Disneyland now.
2035000	2038000	It's Halloween time there. They have Haunted Mansion.
2038000	2039000	I guess it would...
2039000	2042000	The ghost galaxy, if I were a little kid, would be freaked out by it.
2042000	2044000	As an adult, I think it's funny.
2044000	2049000	I think it's dark as in like, you know, the toys, I guess, like, you know, in Toy Story,
2049000	2052000	how they had the toys that the neighbor kid, you know, put together
2052000	2055000	and they're all creepy looking like the baby doll head.
2055000	2056000	That was a spider thing.
2056000	2060000	Imagine that but with Disney head, you know, characters of Disney
2060000	2064000	with their heads all over the place and machine parts and claws and stuff all over the place.
2064000	2066000	I can't believe Disney would allow that.
2066000	2068000	That just seems weird to me.
2068000	2072000	Like, non-distinct heads and things I would get or a nightmare before Christmas.
2072000	2076000	Like, I'll see if I can pull up some pictures for you and check it out.
2076000	2080000	Reading some comments from chat, because there's a lot of talk in chat about Epic Mickey,
2080000	2085000	Black Wolf says, I do know that Square and Disney don't like each other, at least in the US.
2085000	2089000	Kitsune says, even at Tokyo Disney, nothing from Kingdom Hearts.
2089000	2092000	I guess Kitsune has been there recently.
2092000	2096000	Tigerclaw says, oh my, I would imagine during the It's a Small World level,
2096000	2100000	the gamers will be tortured with that music playing on repeat.
2100000	2104000	So, like, here's some concept art that they had for Epic Mickey.
2104000	2106000	It's kind of very steampunk-ish.
2106000	2110000	Like, they have this, like, you know, ship thing with Epcot on there.
2110000	2117000	They've got, you know, just, like, some characters running around and, like, machines and stuff.
2117000	2122000	Like, there's Goofy right there that looks like a zombie almost.
2122000	2125000	Some, like, twisted, I don't even know what that is, you know.
2125000	2130000	This is, you know what this is? This is, like, the Return to Oz of Disney.
2130000	2132000	Did anyone ever see Return to Oz when they were kids?
2132000	2133000	It was awesome.
2133000	2134000	And read the books, too.
2134000	2135000	In the 80s? Dude.
2135000	2138000	Okay, for those that never saw Return to Oz back in the 80s,
2138000	2142000	because I was, like, seven when this movie came out, which means half our listeners weren't even born.
2142000	2146000	But here's the thing is that, okay, when Return to Oz came out,
2146000	2148000	first off, Feruza Balk was Dorothy.
2148000	2151000	And if you don't know who she is, she was, like, the twisted chick in the craft.
2151000	2153000	I don't know what else she's been in lately.
2153000	2155000	But she was in American History X, I think, and something else.
2155000	2156000	Okay, she was Dorothy.
2156000	2160000	And, like, the movie started out with her in an insane asylum, right?
2160000	2167000	And she goes, and she goes to this area where the witch, whoever she was, the bad witch,
2167000	2170000	and you all forgive me, my details of the story are scattered.
2170000	2171000	Maybe Jamie can help.
2171000	2172000	She was another princess.
2172000	2173000	Oh, was she another princess?
2173000	2174000	She collected heads in jars.
2174000	2176000	Of pretty women.
2176000	2178000	Yeah, she was after Dorothy's head to get.
2178000	2181000	So she was, like, and you would actually see, like, the heads in jars and things.
2181000	2187000	And, like, you saw all your favorite, like, characters from The Wizard of Oz, like,
2187000	2192000	Turn to Stone and, like, Frozen and Time, and it was a very dark-looking world.
2192000	2196000	I mean, for the, and this was, I believe, a movie Disney put out, wasn't it?
2196000	2197000	Maybe.
2197000	2202000	Yeah, well, even that, though, the characters that pick up along the way, like TikTok,
2202000	2207000	he was a different clockwork man, and he looked a bit more.
2207000	2212000	But when they brought in the Scarecrow and Tin Man and all of them, they looked very...
2212000	2214000	They looked like the old book.
2214000	2215000	Burtonized.
2215000	2216000	Yeah.
2216000	2222000	If I remember right, this movie took so long to come out because MGM had to lose the rights
2222000	2226000	to make the future Oz movies, and I think Disney put this one out.
2226000	2229000	So it was really weird that it was kind of a darker movie.
2229000	2233000	So, you know, Disney is capable of doing darker things.
2233000	2236000	It is just surprising that it would be their character.
2236000	2238000	That's why I'm calling this the return to Oz of new years.
2238000	2241000	If you don't know what I'm talking about, this movie's like a cult classic now.
2241000	2242000	It's out on DVD.
2242000	2243000	It's awesome.
2243000	2244000	Check it out.
2244000	2245000	It is a pretty awesome movie.
2245000	2248000	Like, it just, it'll warp your fragile little seven-year-old mind if you have kids.
2248000	2252000	It's, if you can't stand The Wizard of Oz, this movie is awesome.
2252000	2253000	I mean, because it's actually...
2253000	2256000	I think they should go back and do all the Oz movies this kind of style because it'd
2256000	2257000	be really sweet.
2257000	2263000	But anyways, so yeah, really creepy shit, you know, that's in all these concept things.
2263000	2265000	And so I hope they stick to it.
2265000	2269000	I mean, I hope they stick to their guns and try something risky because you know what?
2269000	2274000	You can put out a game for Disney's Princess and the Frog, you know,
2274000	2277000	and it may sell X number of copies or whatever, and that's fine.
2277000	2278000	But you know what?
2278000	2280000	Do something ballsy, and you know what?
2280000	2283000	It will, they'll get a good return on it.
2283000	2285000	Because gamers will buy it.
2285000	2289000	I'm curious, you know, and then I'm looking at the big picture is that what could this,
2289000	2293000	you know, if this does really, really well, what could this mean for, like,
2293000	2295000	what would happen at Disneyland and some of these places?
2295000	2298000	Like, could we get, like, an attraction based off of, like, creepy Disney?
2298000	2300000	I don't know.
2300000	2302000	Maybe a California adventure.
2302000	2303000	Maybe.
2303000	2304000	All right.
2304000	2308000	Anyhow, Kitsune, by the way, had never heard of Return to Oz, I guess,
2308000	2310000	and is very excited about the movie.
2310000	2314000	Put the trailer in chat and says, somehow this feels like Labyrinth.
2314000	2316000	Well, it came out around that same time.
2316000	2317000	It does feel kind of like Labyrinth.
2317000	2318000	It was a lot like Labyrinth.
2318000	2321000	I mean, this was that time in the 80s when you had, like, Never Ending Story,
2321000	2324000	Labyrinth, Dark Crystal, you know, Return to Oz.
2324000	2326000	They all came out right around the same time.
2326000	2330000	You know, they were all in that mid-early 80s phase, so.
2330000	2333000	The golden age of, you know, adventure movies.
2333000	2335000	Of fucking up children's minds.
2335000	2338000	Seriously, those are some fucked up movies we had as a kid.
2338000	2341000	Say my name!
2341000	2345000	And then you never really understood what the hell her name was.
2345000	2346000	I never got that.
2346000	2349000	They said what it was.
2349000	2350000	I used to know.
2350000	2352000	Crap, I'll have to look it up again.
2352000	2354000	I think we even tried turning on the subtitles once
2354000	2356000	to find out what her goddamn name was,
2356000	2360000	and it said Untangible or something.
2360000	2364000	Or Scream's name or something like that, where I was like, dammit!
2364000	2366000	All right, anyhow.
2366000	2369000	Moving on to some more gaming news, because Epic Mickey does sound pretty epic.
2369000	2371000	But moving on back to the 360, and I got to say,
2371000	2373000	the early screenshots for this look kind of cool.
2373000	2376000	It's something called the Retrocade.
2376000	2378000	Now, this isn't something that's confirmed.
2378000	2382000	I want to point out, this is news and rumors coming to us from a survey
2382000	2384000	that is currently out there with consumers.
2384000	2386000	And of course, when a survey goes out there,
2386000	2389000	somebody's going to take screen prints of it and send it to your favorite gaming blogs.
2389000	2392000	This is a project that's known as a lot of different names,
2392000	2393000	according to the survey.
2393000	2398000	Game Room, Retrocade, Tower of Rom, Classics Live.
2398000	2402000	Tower of Rom is kind of awesome, although I don't see that being the actual name.
2402000	2407000	I think Retrocade or Classics Live sound a lot more realistic.
2407000	2415000	Anyhow, they are saying that this is something that I guess looks a lot like PlayStation Home,
2415000	2417000	but they're not calling it PlayStation Home.
2417000	2420000	It's just something where the 360 avatars are in there,
2420000	2427000	and they're kind of walking around, and they're playing arcade games.
2427000	2429000	That's all we really know based on the survey.
2429000	2431000	We don't know to the full extent what the interactivity is here.
2431000	2433000	But you look at one of these screenshots,
2433000	2436000	and you can see two levels of video games with the avatars around.
2436000	2438000	And when I look at the titles of the games,
2438000	2440000	they look like they might actually be old-school games.
2440000	2444000	That little graphic there, that's an Intellivision graphic.
2444000	2447000	That little guy there is from the Intellivision series.
2447000	2451000	And it looks like the name of the game there is baseball from Intellivision.
2451000	2453000	Yeah, it has the Atari logos.
2453000	2455000	So I don't know what the deal is going on here.
2455000	2457000	Maybe this is like old-school 80s games,
2457000	2459000	Atari and Intellivision coming out, or what it is.
2459000	2462000	But it could be interesting.
2462000	2466000	I don't know, what would you guys like to see in regards to retro-ness on the 360?
2466000	2468000	I think it would be cool to have something like that.
2468000	2470000	Or that would be even kind of cool instead of like home.
2470000	2475000	You can just go walk around and play arcade games.
2475000	2480000	Instead of watching Twilight trailers.
2480000	2481000	Right.
2481000	2483000	But yeah, I've got to say though,
2483000	2487000	doing this in home, going into a virtual space to launch a game,
2487000	2488000	isn't that exciting?
2488000	2491000	Like it's one of those things that seems a lot cooler when you hear about it.
2491000	2493000	It's kind of irritating, isn't it?
2493000	2496000	Yeah, so I've got to wonder, what is going to make this cool?
2496000	2500000	Why am I going to want to go into this little front end with all the little avatars?
2500000	2503000	Beer would make it cool.
2503000	2505000	Achievement points.
2505000	2507000	Oh Lord.
2507000	2509000	You have found a game! Achievement point!
2509000	2512000	You have sneezed, achievement point.
2512000	2514000	Sadly, you're probably right.
2514000	2516000	No! Hey, I got an idea.
2516000	2520000	Well, it wouldn't really work with the classic games so much,
2520000	2523000	but like you could have, you know, say,
2523000	2526000	redemption games and you earn tickets or whatever
2526000	2530000	and you can redeem stuff for your avatar like costumes and crap.
2530000	2533000	What if, you might be onto something here,
2533000	2538000	what if Xbox Live charged you like ten cents to play
2538000	2542000	for one play of these games that might redeem?
2542000	2544000	You know, because there was other news this week,
2544000	2546000	and I know Bobby talked about it on his show,
2546000	2547000	it didn't make the cut for our show,
2547000	2550000	but they talked about the sports jerseys.
2550000	2552000	I know he talked about it on his show.
2552000	2554000	The sports jerseys made their way to Xbox Live this week.
2554000	2556000	What, four bucks a pop for the jerseys?
2556000	2558000	And I know he was surveying his listeners tonight about,
2558000	2562000	you know, would they pay for that or not?
2562000	2566000	Do you think there would be any interest in putting in like ten cents,
2566000	2570000	twenty-five cents to play a game and possibly unlock something from the game?
2570000	2571000	Do you think people would do that?
2571000	2573000	I think people would bite at that, you know,
2573000	2575000	like eight points or something like that.
2575000	2577000	Because they've talked about this as a distribution method
2577000	2579000	for games before for the online games,
2579000	2582000	both PSN and Xbox Live, is they put in a quarter to play the game
2582000	2585000	and then that way you're not paying like five bucks to own it
2585000	2587000	if you're only going to play it once or twice.
2587000	2590000	Is your mic on?
2590000	2591000	No, it is now.
2591000	2592000	There it is.
2592000	2593000	There's consumer wars out there.
2593000	2595000	I would try it just to try it.
2595000	2599000	I think that a quarter would be, well,
2599000	2604000	I think that it should be along the lines of, oh, play this,
2604000	2609000	and if you decide that you want it permanently then, you know,
2609000	2610000	like pay for demo.
2610000	2614000	Well, either way, you know it's going to be their virtual money anyway.
2614000	2615000	Yeah.
2615000	2618000	So, all right.
2618000	2621000	Well, anyhow, it's going to be interesting to see what comes of that.
2621000	2622000	Of course, it could be nothing.
2622000	2623000	It could just be a survey.
2623000	2624000	We'll see.
2624000	2627000	DarkSakura.
2627000	2632000	Well, for other, I guess we can sort of call this nostalgic
2632000	2635000	even though it's an ongoing series,
2635000	2639000	but there's the pop music portable
2639000	2642000	that's supposed to be coming out on PSP
2642000	2644000	with the nine button mode and everything,
2644000	2648000	but it looks like there's going to be a story mode in it.
2648000	2653000	And so, because you can go around like sort of a board game map thingy
2653000	2659000	like Mario Party-ish, and you go that way to unlock new songs and things,
2659000	2663000	but this sort of makes me think of, like, you know the pop music,
2663000	2668000	I have pop music seven where you play through
2668000	2672000	as the little superhero guy at the end of the thing like a board game
2672000	2673000	and you unlock stuff.
2673000	2675000	It's more like an old RPG,
2675000	2680000	but maybe that's just the post game unlock mode thing.
2680000	2682000	I don't know if it's an actual story mode.
2682000	2685000	Now, for those who don't know what pop music is,
2685000	2688000	because not everybody who listens to our show now is a music game fan,
2688000	2691000	it's basically think like, I guess you could say,
2691000	2693000	a guitar hero or a rock band,
2693000	2697000	but with a controller that looks like nine pop-o-matic bubbles
2697000	2698000	from the game Trouble,
2698000	2701000	and they're kind of laid out in a five on the bottom,
2701000	2703000	four on the top pattern,
2703000	2707000	and you use these to play songs like a la Guitar Hero, basically.
2707000	2710000	How in the hell is this going to translate to PSP?
2710000	2713000	Maybe they'll have an add-on or something?
2713000	2715000	Japan's kind of used to this, though.
2715000	2717000	Japan kind of will play these games.
2717000	2719000	You've seen DDR on the Game Boy.
2719000	2721000	They have DJ Max on there.
2721000	2724000	Yeah, DJ Max is really popular on PSP and other countries.
2724000	2727000	Even here, to some extent, has a cult following here.
2727000	2731000	I guess these type of button beat games are okay.
2731000	2733000	Would this game ever come out in the US, though?
2733000	2734000	I don't know.
2734000	2737000	How desperate is Konami for money? That's really the question.
2737000	2740000	You would think, though, now that it's all going digital distribution,
2740000	2744000	how hard would it be for them to just slap it up on the download and let it be?
2744000	2746000	Minimal localization for that.
2746000	2749000	Right, but do you think they'll still do it? Probably not.
2749000	2750000	No, they're leaving.
2750000	2751000	Sad.
2751000	2752000	Unfortunately.
2752000	2753000	Anyway.
2753000	2757000	All right, well, I guess we'll see if a controller comes out for this game or not,
2757000	2758000	but probably not.
2758000	2761000	But the story modes, hey, this game already sounds better than pop-o-music.
2761000	2763000	We are getting that here in America.
2763000	2770000	And it's already better than whatever beaten groovy told you we started.
2770000	2773000	Anyways, DJ Hero will be coming out in a couple weeks,
2773000	2778000	and the full song list has been released by Activision
2778000	2784000	and features 93 tracks with 100 different songs composing those tracks.
2784000	2786000	And some of the neat little things I thought I'd mention,
2786000	2792000	some of the tracks that we have here that I thought were interesting.
2792000	2793000	Let's see.
2793000	2795000	Of course, you may remember the remix that I did,
2795000	2798000	Shout vs. Eric Pride's Piano.
2798000	2802000	Well, there's also going to be two other Shout remixes as well.
2802000	2807000	Tears for Fears Shout vs. DJ Shadow's 6 Days remix featuring Mos Def
2807000	2810000	and Shout vs. Eric B and Rakim.
2810000	2812000	Eric B is the president.
2812000	2818000	That one is mixed by DJ Jazzy Jeff, all completely different sounding.
2818000	2820000	They have another one also versus piano,
2820000	2823000	Somebody Told Me by The Killers vs. Piano, which will be interesting.
2823000	2827000	Vanilla Ice Ice Ice Baby vs. MC Hammer You Can't Touch This.
2827000	2833000	And then also a little bit more 80's or I guess early 90's music in there.
2833000	2839000	Ice Ice Baby vs. Paula Abdul's Straight Up, which that would be kind of interesting.
2839000	2844000	If that's not your kind of thing, there may be some Herbie Hancock Rocket.
2844000	2848000	They've got a beat juggle version of that and also Rocket vs. Nerd's Lap Dance.
2848000	2852000	That one's produced by Grandmaster Flash.
2852000	2860000	And then Foreigner, Jukebox Hero vs. DJ Z-Trip featuring Mers, DJ Hero.
2860000	2866000	That's produced and mixed by DJ Z-Trip.
2866000	2869000	And then some of the songs that we'll be hearing tonight later on.
2869000	2875000	Foreigner, Jukebox Hero, only live for our live listeners during break.
2875000	2879000	Foo Fighters Monkey Wrench vs. BC Boys Sabotage, the DJ guitar mix.
2879000	2884000	And then also, what do we got here?
2884000	2894000	Boom Boom Pow by Black Eyed Peas and Satisfaction by Benny Banasi.
2894000	2897000	And lots more stuff.
2897000	2900000	But yeah, you can check out the full track list. It's online everywhere.
2900000	2904000	Lots of good songs. I'm very excited to play all these.
2904000	2908000	Now we're actually going to give DJ Hero a little spin here in studio quick.
2908000	2911000	I don't think we're going to play all the songs because of copyright.
2911000	2913000	We'll just play like maybe a minute or so.
2913000	2915000	But just if you kind of want to hear what this game sounds like.
2915000	2918000	And it's going to be tricky because I kind of want Loki to describe what...
2918000	2920000	Or I guess maybe I'll describe kind of what he's doing.
2920000	2925000	This is going to be weird radio, but can we plug in DJ Hero and get some of the noise out on the feed here?
2925000	2928000	And I'm going to kind of describe what Loki's doing as he's playing this game.
2928000	2932000	Where are the audio ties? Oh, they're down there. Are those them?
2932000	2935000	Or is that where they're... Okay.
2935000	2941000	Hold on guys. Live radio. We're actually plugging in the audio for DJ Hero right now.
2941000	2946000	Can you shut it down a little bit?
2954000	2957000	Okay. Did that take down my mics too?
2957000	2962000	Okay. Sorry guys. We're adjusting the audio live here.
2962000	2965000	So, alright.
2965000	2969000	So here we go. So Loki's going to hit start.
2969000	2974000	I don't hear anything either.
2974000	2980000	Oh, there it is. Very quiet. There we go.
2980000	2984000	Sorry guys. I know this isn't the most interesting radio in the world, but right now there's a menu here.
2984000	2988000	Learn to DJ. Quick play single DJ. That's what Loki picked.
2988000	2991000	And in this demo we have Marvin Gaye versus Gorillaz.
2991000	2996000	Gwen Stefani versus Rick James and Black Eyed Peas versus Benny Banasi.
2996000	3001000	And you can actually see it shows you on the screen who is presenting the track.
3001000	3006000	It shows what's called the intensity, which this is low.
3006000	3011000	And the duration, 3 minutes and 48 seconds for the song that Loki currently has selected.
3011000	3014000	And then you can actually see performance on different levels.
3014000	3019000	I don't know if that shows how well Loki's done or what that is showing there.
3019000	3024000	Do we have the audio?
3027000	3030000	Is the connection bad?
3030000	3034000	There you go.
3034000	3044000	I think those wires are weird.
3044000	3049000	Uh oh, is there a mixing board? That's not good.
3049000	3054000	Sorry guys.
3054000	3059000	The reason why you're hearing it bounce from left to right, those of you listening live, are podcasts are mono.
3059000	3066000	Loki's doing one at a time here.
3066000	3069000	We're having the board just to match it. There you go.
3069000	3076000	Don't touch it. Just play.
3076000	3078000	Did the audio already go out?
3078000	3080000	Oh crap.
3080000	3083000	All right. Well, maybe we won't get to play it live tonight.
3083000	3086000	We will later. You're going to fix it for later.
3086000	3090000	All right. So we just won't get to play it during the show for the podcasters. That was a waste of time.
3090000	3092000	Sorry guys.
3092000	3094000	Are you working on that now?
3094000	3098000	All right. All right. Fair enough.
3098000	3101000	I don't know what to talk about here in the meantime.
3101000	3104000	Should I just go on to the next story? We'll come back.
3104000	3108000	Yeah, we'll do that. I'm going to go on to the next story. We'll come back.
3108000	3111000	The next story has to do with the Wii Balance Board.
3111000	3116000	The Wii Balance Board apparently is now being used in some airport screening.
3116000	3120000	Now, this is only a study. It's not actually something you're going to go to the airport and see right now.
3120000	3129000	But apparently, the US government has invested some money into actually looking at using the Wii Balance Board in airport screening.
3129000	3132000	So this is according to a CNN report.
3132000	3138000	This is a couple of experimental methods that are being used right now to see who is suspicious at the airport.
3138000	3144000	This is being done by scientists that are part of the Future Attribute Screening Technology, or FAST program.
3144000	3149000	They're actually using the Wii Fit peripheral to see how somebody shifts their weight.
3149000	3155000	They're trying to find, quote, a level of fidgeting that would suggest the need for a secondary screening.
3155000	3160000	So they're using the Wii Balance Board, I guess it's something that you would kind of step on before you go through the gate,
3160000	3165000	to see if you are really fidgety while you're going into the airport.
3165000	3170000	That's kind of weird to me because what if you're just old and you just shake a lot?
3170000	3173000	I mean, wouldn't that set off some red flags?
3173000	3178000	I don't know about you guys, but I don't think this is something you're actually going to see at an airport for quite some time.
3178000	3182000	You certainly wouldn't see a Wii Balance Board, that's for sure.
3182000	3188000	Would you see that type of technology embedded into a mat that you step on before you go through the terminal?
3188000	3192000	Sure. But are you going to see the Wii Balance Board itself out there?
3192000	3196000	Heck no. That's just going to look dumb. Besides, those things are kind of thin.
3196000	3201000	And don't forget the Wii Balance Board only supports up to like 300 or 350 pounds.
3201000	3204000	That doesn't include everybody that you need to screen at an airport.
3204000	3212000	So if anything else, they may have to take the same technology and use it in some other new device.
3212000	3216000	Although I don't know why seeing the balance of somebody is going to show if they're a terrorist or not.
3216000	3218000	That seems a little silly to me.
3218000	3225000	I have this bad feeling that this whole thing was just a footnote on some other study that people are taking way too seriously.
3225000	3229000	Yeah, an X-Link in chat says, old person with MS, Suez Airport.
3229000	3232000	Yeah, I can see that. I can see that happening.
3232000	3238000	How we doing, Loki? We okay? Loki's got some new plugs he's going to try.
3238000	3241000	Like I said, I want to try this the first time.
3241000	3244000	This is the way he wanted to do it the first time, I guess.
3244000	3246000	Of course, I'm not hearing anything.
3246000	3250000	Oh.
3250000	3257000	It's those plugs there are bad.
3257000	3265000	Do you have another red and white set you can use besides those plugs?
3265000	3268000	Only on live radio could this happen, boys and girls.
3268000	3272000	What about the gray cords? There's gray cords in the box that we used to use.
3272000	3278000	Those will extend.
3278000	3284000	Okay, we're trying to right now extend.
3284000	3289000	Will that even work? Okay, he says yes.
3289000	3292000	And hopefully these plugs will be a little better.
3292000	3295000	And that's what Loki is putting in right now.
3295000	3299000	As we try to demo DJ Hero for you guys here on Orange Lodge Radio.
3299000	3302000	Much better.
3302000	3306000	Alright.
3306000	3309000	Okay.
3309000	3312000	So which track are you going to play here?
3312000	3318000	Oh yeah, I'm going to get one. Here we go.
3318000	3321000	So he can pick his character here if he wants, but he didn't.
3321000	3326000	So now he's cool Papa G is the character he is.
3326000	3329000	There's also one named Kitty Smash.
3329000	3331000	It's like a punk chick.
3331000	3332000	So alright.
3332000	3334000	So he's going to go cool Papa G.
3334000	3336000	And now he's picking his difficulty.
3336000	3338000	He's going with medium.
3338000	3341000	Sorry.
3341000	3344000	Alright, so the song is currently loading.
3344000	3346000	And there's a tip on the screen.
3346000	3348000	Rewinds are a great way to earn a big score.
3348000	3351000	Try them in a section you know well.
3351000	3353000	And it's showing him a little bit about how to play the game.
3353000	3356000	There's a euphoria button, an effects dial.
3356000	3361000	Alright, so this is Marvin Gaye versus Gorillaz.
3361000	3363000	He's laying down the track.
3363000	3366000	Here we go.
3366000	3378000	And right now he's hitting buttons on the controller in time with the beats as they fall.
3378000	3385000	He's also moving the crossfader back and forth as you see it on the green and the blue sides.
3385000	3389000	I don't know if he's holding the button down when he does that.
3389000	3393000	And when he sees these little arrows on the track, he actually has to keep scratching.
3393000	3407000	Let's just check some there.
3407000	3409000	I want this remix really bad.
3409000	3414000	And Logan's actually having to hold down the green or the blue button when he scratches.
3414000	3440000	Because they're scratching on both the green and the blue track.
3440000	3452000	What was that in the middle? He just blared a horn.
3452000	3453000	Very interesting.
3453000	3455000	Alright, I don't know if we can play much more here.
3455000	3457000	I'm going to cut you off, Logan.
3457000	3459000	Can you just pause it?
3459000	3462000	Or fail it or whatever?
3462000	3463000	Alright, there he is. He's going to pause it there.
3463000	3466000	You will get to hear the whole thing of that on break later.
3466000	3470000	But unfortunately for the podcast, we have to cut it off because we don't want to get sued by the makers of DJ Hero.
3470000	3474000	So we used a little bit there for critical review purposes only.
3474000	3475000	As we're allowed to do.
3475000	3478000	So, there you go.
3478000	3479000	Interesting.
3479000	3481000	Yeah, it is a bummer we don't have TV.
3481000	3485000	I don't know what exciting radio that made, but at least I was able to get a feel for the game.
3485000	3487000	Now I kind of want to play.
3487000	3488000	Yeah, it looks like fun.
3488000	3489000	I'll have to play later.
3489000	3490000	Alright.
3490000	3494000	Anyhow, we'll get into more DJ Hero here in a little bit, but we have some more news.
3494000	3496000	Dark Soccer is going to take us to our next story.
3496000	3499000	I am. Well, I guess I am.
3499000	3505000	For fans of Beatles Rock Band, there is an actual download content plan in store.
3505000	3511000	But it's based on how well the next three sets of download content go.
3511000	3522000	Because the process for doing everything for Beatles Rock Band is expensive and intensive.
3522000	3527000	Because it's not just like, you know, mastering one song in.
3527000	3537000	You have to send off the original tape and redo it and bring it back in and have level animation and whatnot ready for it.
3537000	3541000	Because it has to fit in with their whole, I guess, branding or whatever.
3541000	3543000	The feel of the game.
3543000	3546000	It has to fit the identity of the game.
3546000	3551000	So, they want to see how everything sells first.
3551000	3557000	Right now, of course, the only downloadable content is All You Need Is Love.
3557000	3566000	But on October 20th, we're getting Abbey Road, which will be 1360 Microsoft Points.
3566000	3568000	Or 160 points per track.
3568000	3573000	And then we get Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band and Rubber Soul, which Rubber Soul is my favorite.
3573000	3574000	Just saying.
3574000	3576000	Great album.
3576000	3579000	I had it on vinyl.
3579000	3585000	And, of course, those are coming out in November and December, respectively.
3585000	3587000	So, I think it makes sense.
3587000	3593000	Because it is really a lot of work that goes into it.
3593000	3599000	Not just for having to master the tracks, but like I said, you've got to make sure that the animation is lined up.
3599000	3603000	That everything is going to fit the feel of the rest of the game.
3603000	3608000	Which is why you can't go in and play Aerosmith on Beatles Rock Band or something like that.
3608000	3610000	Even though that would be kind of fun.
3610000	3612000	That would be in Guitar Hero.
3612000	3614000	You know what I mean, as an example.
3614000	3619000	Well, you can't expect that there's going to be new content every week for the Beatles Rock Band.
3619000	3622000	Obviously, there's a very limited catalog to what they can pick from.
3622000	3624000	And, of course, you're talking about old music.
3624000	3633000	You're talking about very protected, very delicate, world icon music that has got to be scrutinized very carefully.
3633000	3637000	It makes sense why this is not going to be a floodgate worth of material.
3637000	3645000	If the game enough isn't enough for you, I don't think the download content is going to give you anything that's going to make you go, OMG must buy this game.
3645000	3648000	If the game enough wasn't good enough, forget it.
3648000	3651000	But it would be nice to see them pour some more stuff out here.
3651000	3659000	My thought on this is that there are actually a number of songs in the home game that are just a few that I'm really not familiar with.
3659000	3667000	And certain songs in different eras are ones that are not on my list of old favorites.
3667000	3671000	I like a lot of the mid to older stuff better.
3671000	3676000	But isn't it like maybe exposing you to stuff you haven't heard from a band that is so iconic?
3676000	3677000	I'll put it this way.
3677000	3682000	I've at least heard most of the songs in the game once at least.
3682000	3688000	But I don't really look at it as being a new kind of exposure.
3688000	3692000	It's just that I would rather have some of my favorites.
3692000	3701000	Although I wonder how they're doing some of the ones that didn't have a drum track or didn't have any guitar.
3701000	3706000	For example, Eleanor Rigby only had strings.
3706000	3711000	So maybe you put your guitar up to your neck and play as a violin.
3711000	3712000	I'm joking.
3712000	3719000	You could probably play a sort of like a Let's Talk More Rock instead of Keytar.
3719000	3722000	You have, you know.
3722000	3724000	Violin Rock.
3724000	3725000	Vanessa May.
3725000	3731000	Anyhow, let's go ahead and get into some release dates for games that are coming out this week.
3731000	3735000	Yeah, I got a good selection of games coming out this week.
3735000	3741000	Starting things off, Witch's Tale, which is going to be coming out on DS.
3741000	3745000	Also this week, NBA 2K10 is coming out on PC.
3745000	3747000	I guess it got delayed from the rest of them.
3747000	3752000	Kars Racerama pretty much coming out on everything.
3752000	3754000	Squeeballs Party on the Wii and DS.
3754000	3759000	You may remember this was the game that was supposed to have a Wii remote type of controller for the Xbox 360.
3759000	3761000	That version got cancelled, unfortunately.
3761000	3764000	But you can pick it up on the rest of the systems.
3764000	3771000	Also, kind of a Grey's Hits edition of Midnight Club Los Angeles is coming out.
3771000	3776000	The Complete Edition with the download content intact and for the Grey's Hits price.
3776000	3780000	Pets Pony Beauty Pageant for the DS.
3780000	3784000	Sing Star Latino coming out on PlayStation 2.
3784000	3785000	That's interesting.
3785000	3786000	Didn't know that was coming over here.
3786000	3791000	Ju-On, The Grudge, Haunted House Simulator for the Wii.
3791000	3793000	Making its way out this week.
3793000	3801000	Africa on PS3, which apparently has been getting horrible reviews.
3801000	3803000	It's about time that game comes out, though.
3803000	3804000	Africa.
3804000	3805000	Yes.
3805000	3812000	Where the Wild Things are coming out, tying with the new movie.
3812000	3816000	That'll be on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Wii, and DS.
3816000	3818000	Maybe PSP.
3818000	3822000	Magna Carta 2 coming out on Xbox 360.
3822000	3825000	Sing Star Motown coming out on PlayStation 3.
3825000	3827000	Also another game I was unaware of.
3827000	3834000	Heroes Saga Leviathan Tactics coming out on DS.
3834000	3839000	Mario and Sonic at the Olympic Winter Games on the Wii and DS this week.
3839000	3844000	Brutal Legend making its way out on Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3.
3844000	3846000	Kind of go along with Epic Games like that.
3846000	3850000	Uncharted 2 Among Thieves coming out this week on PlayStation 3.
3850000	3853000	Half Minute Hero coming out on PlayStation Portable.
3853000	3855000	That'll be pretty awesome.
3855000	3856000	They haven't bought Fallout 3 yet.
3856000	3862000	Fallout 3 Game of the Year Edition with all the download content with it for 60 bucks.
3862000	3865000	That's coming out on Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, and PC.
3865000	3869000	Way of the Samurai on Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 this week.
3869000	3874000	Grand Theft Auto Chinatown Wars on PSP.
3874000	3878000	Sudoku Ball Detective on the Wii.
3878000	3880000	Buck Fever on the Wii.
3880000	3885000	And a boy and his blob on the Wii.
3885000	3886000	That's going to be awesome.
3886000	3887000	Really?
3887000	3888000	Yeah.
3888000	3889000	Boy, that came out under the radar, didn't it?
3889000	3892000	I actually saw something for that a little earlier today.
3892000	3896000	I thought I'd seen something on one of the blogs, but I got the impression this game was still in development.
3896000	3898000	I didn't realize it was coming out now.
3898000	3900000	It's ready to go.
3900000	3901000	Interesting.
3901000	3905000	Agatha Christie's ABC Murders coming out on DS this week.
3905000	3906000	Woohoo.
3906000	3907000	Yeah.
3907000	3910000	Hope Angela Lansbury does some voice acting in that.
3910000	3912000	I'm a big fan.
3912000	3913000	And that's it.
3913000	3914000	All right.
3914000	3916000	Japanese release dates are not here this week.
3916000	3918000	We'll get back to those next week.
3918000	3923000	So apologies to those folks looking for the releases in Japan, but my resource is not working right now.
3923000	3926000	So we'll have to just skip over to Euro release dates, right, Jimmy?
3926000	3932000	Well, what we have is Brutal Legend on the 16th for PS3 and Xbox 360.
3932000	3935000	Harvest Fishing, yay.
3935000	3941000	Magna Carta 2, Mario and Luigi Bowser's Inside Story, which actually that sounds pretty fun to me.
3941000	3945000	Playing as a big old lizard guy.
3945000	3947000	Playing inside of him.
3947000	3948000	Yeah.
3948000	3950000	The nose and rump command.
3950000	3952000	That sounds funny.
3952000	3956000	Mario and Sonic at the Olympic Winter Games on the 16th.
3956000	3962000	And Ninja Captains, as well as Tropico 3.
3962000	3967000	Oh, and also Uncharted 2 among thieves.
3967000	3970000	That we all are.
3970000	3972000	I'm hearing great things about Uncharted 2.
3972000	3974000	I just want to say great, great things.
3974000	3975000	Uncharted.
3975000	3977000	I want to kind of check it out.
3977000	3978000	This looks...
3978000	3984000	I'm looking at more of the stuff from the Mario and Luigi Bowser's Inside Story.
3984000	3986000	That actually looks pretty cute.
3986000	3988000	Well, those Mario and Luigi games were always fun.
3988000	3990000	I feel like they've kind of like really milked that series.
3990000	3994000	But, you know, they've always been a good kind of role playing game for the DS.
3994000	3997000	Yeah.
3997000	4001000	Okay, so you may not be having trouble with your vision.
4001000	4004000	But hey, who says that you can't improve upon what you already have?
4004000	4009000	And apparently a company that makes gaming glasses is looking to do that.
4009000	4012000	The new glasses are called Gunner Optics.
4012000	4015000	And they're designed to improve your gaming performance.
4015000	4021000	Apparently they have some special coating and tints to them.
4021000	4027000	And apparently they do everything from reducing glare to blocking out evaporative air currents.
4027000	4029000	Okay.
4029000	4032000	Basically, to me, they look like shooting glasses.
4032000	4034000	But just with a fancier frame.
4034000	4036000	They kind of have that same yellow tint to them.
4036000	4037000	The prices are $100.
4037000	4040000	And apparently Ars Technica took them out for a test drive.
4040000	4043000	And actually found out that they do what they say.
4043000	4047000	And actually did have an effect during prolonged gaming sessions.
4047000	4051000	Whether that's worth the $100 or not is, I guess, your decision.
4051000	4053000	But they look neat.
4053000	4056000	You know, I guess a little bit geek chic.
4056000	4057000	I don't know.
4057000	4060000	Maybe if I, I don't know, that might look good in glasses.
4060000	4063000	I'm not going to drop $100 on glasses, though.
4063000	4064000	Let me see these.
4064000	4068000	Well, you know, a good pair of regular glasses will cost you several hundred dollars.
4068000	4069000	So, you know.
4069000	4071000	Mine cost $430.
4071000	4073000	That's why people have vision insurance, but.
4073000	4078000	And if it's just yellow tint, I have yellow tinted glasses I bought for $10 that are basically
4078000	4081000	this same thing, except without the fancy frame.
4081000	4084000	And, you know, maybe I should try those.
4084000	4086000	Except I don't like running around with those, because.
4086000	4089000	Well, didn't some big website put this on a study and vouch for it?
4089000	4090000	I mean, so.
4090000	4091000	Yeah.
4091000	4092000	There's got to be something more there, Loki.
4092000	4095000	I don't think this is something you can just get the tinted lens at the 98 cent clearance
4095000	4097000	center and run with, you know.
4097000	4100000	Well, not necessarily those, but like, you know, shooting glasses.
4100000	4107000	I bought them for Airsofting, but they're dangerous to wear Airsofting, because, you
4107000	4111000	know, those BBs can bounce underneath them, and that's not good, so you need like full
4111000	4112000	face goggles.
4112000	4116000	But I did buy them, and they worked okay, you know, because they didn't fog up, and
4116000	4117000	that was positive to me.
4117000	4122000	But after wearing them for an extended period of time, your eyes kind of hurt because everything's
4122000	4125000	like a yellow tint, and you take them off, and you're like, what?
4125000	4126000	Colors other than yellow.
4126000	4128000	What the hell?
4128000	4152620	Well, according to Tiger Claw in our chat room, chat.orange
4152620	4156620	on twitter.com, apparently Dead Pixel Live, another show here on allgames.com, had an
4156620	4158120	awesome day.
4158120	4159120	Alright, anyhow.
4159120	4162620	Moving on to one more game news story here, and then we're getting to the classic game
4162620	4164620	of the week.
4164620	4167080	PSP Minis.
4167080	4168940	You know, these are coming out now.
4168940	4173380	You saw kind of the first wave of these hit when the PSP Go came out, but something that
4173380	4180000	PSP Minis are having to account for in their price point, the ESRB ratings apparently are
4180000	4183860	setting these developers back $2,500.
4183860	4189000	So you might see a game here on a PSP that you see on the iPhone as well, and it costs
4189000	4192720	more on the PSP, and the whole reason why is the ESRB.
4192720	4198320	And something I didn't think of before is that the ESRB, you don't have to get a rating
4198320	4201720	from that for the iPhone game, surprisingly enough.
4201720	4204800	Isn't that something you think that's going to come to a head later on?
4204800	4208040	Like isn't that just a bag of uh-oh waiting to be open?
4208040	4212560	No, not really, because if you think about it, they kind of go through their own review
4212560	4218600	process through Apple, and really it's Apple as a platform that determines whether they
4218600	4222380	want to put games on their platform that have an ESRB rating or not.
4222380	4226800	And if they say, yeah, we'll take whatever, even if it doesn't have a rating or not, then
4226800	4229880	there's really nothing the ESRB can do.
4229880	4234200	Although it should be noted the ESRB is the president, I'm sorry, I do want to mention
4234200	4238360	this, the president has been on record saying not that long ago that Apple should be going
4238360	4239640	to their rating system for the iPhone.
4239640	4241560	Well, of course, they want the $2,500.
4241560	4245680	They want money for all those ratings and stuff, but you know what, if they don't want
4245680	4250800	to do it, and they don't have to do it, so to hell with you.
4250800	4255320	Interesting point from xlink in chat, kids don't have an iPhone, adults do.
4255320	4256320	But what about-
4256320	4257320	I know kids with iPhones.
4257320	4258320	Yeah.
4258320	4259320	What the hell are you talking about?
4259320	4260320	What about an iTouch, too?
4260320	4262640	I mean, he makes a good point that an iTouch, you don't have to have a phone contract for.
4262640	4263640	That sounds dirty, Rob.
4263640	4264640	Well, that's true, though.
4264640	4265640	The apps are for the iTouch, too.
4265640	4267080	It's an iPod Touch.
4267080	4271320	At least they don't have a kids version called iTouch Kids, because that would be bad.
4271320	4272320	Fine.
4272320	4273320	iPod Touch.
4273320	4274320	Sorry.
4274320	4275320	I thought it was an iTouch.
4275320	4276320	Whatever.
4276320	4277320	Shut up.
4277320	4278320	All right.
4278320	4279320	I got to do a story.
4279320	4280320	Yes.
4280320	4281320	I know.
4281320	4282320	What's that?
4282320	4283320	Down the line.
4283320	4284320	I can't shut up yet.
4284320	4285320	No.
4285320	4286320	All right.
4286320	4290600	Anyhow, I just wanted to say, though, real quick, that if you wonder why the PSP Minis
4290600	4295020	are more expensive, that is something the developers are citing as kind of their excuse,
4295020	4296200	for lack of a better term.
4296200	4297560	So there you go.
4297560	4298560	All right.
4298560	4302280	So we're going to get into another segment we like to do here on Orange Lounge Radio.
4302280	4305480	Every week is kind of our Part B segment, so to speak.
4305480	4309920	And it's a part where Dark Sakura gets to climb through her gaming vault and find a
4309920	4313280	game that, you know what, she thinks you guys ought to be playing.
4313280	4318400	And this is a segment we like to call the Classic Video Game of the Week.
4318400	4324080	Oh, Dark Sakura, what should the kids be playing this week?
4324080	4327080	Well, this is a game that I have admitted to everybody.
4327080	4328080	I have not played it.
4328080	4329080	I have seen it.
4329080	4330080	No, I take it back.
4330080	4331080	I started it once.
4331080	4336640	But people have suggested it to me, and earlier today, a friend of mine suggested it to me
4336640	4337640	as well.
4337640	4339720	Megzi suggested it.
4339720	4343200	Is Super Mario RPG Legend of the Seven Stars?
4343200	4345480	Well, it's about time.
4345480	4348640	This is a classic game, Dark Sakura, even if you somehow missed it.
4348640	4350960	This is definitely one of the all-time classic games.
4350960	4355440	In fact, a game that I was surprised we have never featured here on the Classic Game of
4355440	4356440	the Week segment.
4356440	4364080	So, I am going to play some music from it for you right now as soon as the website cooperates,
4364080	4365560	which it is not right now.
4365560	4368080	I'm not doing anything extra internet-y.
4368080	4369080	We may not.
4369080	4370080	There we go.
4370080	4373760	I just picked random level music.
4373760	4383520	Anyway, Super Mario RPG is an sort of adventure and role-playing game that's put out by Square
4383520	4386040	back in the day and Nintendo.
4386040	4392040	It came out in Japan on March 9th, 1996, and on May 13th, 1996, in North America.
4392040	4394660	Europe did not get it.
4394660	4401960	Not until it came out on the Virtual Console, August 22nd, 2008, which, according to this
4401960	4409120	reference, is the longest difference in time between release dates in Nintendo's history.
4409120	4410120	I had to change the YouTube.
4410120	4414960	Sorry, the other one wasn't loading right, so here we go.
4414960	4427440	Anyway, this was made pretty much all in-house by Square with guidance from Miyamoto, so
4427440	4429440	big deal.
4429440	4432960	The battle system in this game was pretty cool.
4432960	4440760	It's very similar to Chrono Trigger so that it's action-based, but you don't necessarily
4440760	4444240	just stick in your monster battles.
4444240	4451920	It does play rather isometrically, and you can see your enemies, and you can't, you know,
4451920	4458880	you don't fight with one until you run into one, so that's what I mean by Chrono Trigger-like.
4458880	4463320	But with your battle system, you can play Mario, Mallow, Geno, Bowser, or Princess Toadstool.
4463320	4470640	They all, of course, have their own attacks, and it is turn-based, this traditional turn-based
4470640	4482880	system, but you do have timed button presses, where how you do your commands determines
4482880	4490160	how your results come out, so pretty cool, and of course you have items and stuff.
4490160	4498480	But yeah, with the game, you go visit all the Toad people, and you have Moleville, and
4498480	4505640	a monster town, and you have the Yoshi town, and you have the cloud place called Nimbus
4505640	4514400	Land where the cloud people live, and Bowser's castle, and all this other crazy stuff, but
4514400	4519680	you play, but yeah, there are some original characters on there, I mean, not just, you
4519680	4526960	know, Mario and Toadstool and Bowser who come from the other games, but you have Mallow
4526960	4537520	who is a cloud boy who thinks he's a tadpole, and Geno who is possessed by a creature from
4537520	4545240	the star road, and then, of course, Bowser and his little friends, so that's the game.
4545240	4546400	Pretty cool.
4546400	4552800	It's got its own fun look, and its own fun music, and also though, this is, I've mentioned
4552800	4559600	this before, but it's one of the only three games that came outside of Japan that used
4559600	4568440	the Nintendo SA1, the others being Kirby Superstar and Kirby's Dream Land 3, so basically, and
4568440	4574520	this was another microprocessor, but it had allowed a higher clock speed, faster RAM,
4574520	4581440	greater memory mapping, data storage compression, new DMA modes such as bitmap to bitplane,
4581440	4586400	and builds in CIC lockout, so, pretty cool.
4586400	4596880	Oh yeah, it had different sound effects that used the SBC 700, so that was pretty cool.
4596880	4601600	This game was really advanced for when it came out, so.
4601600	4604360	Alright, well there you go.
4604360	4609920	Super Mario RPG finally, after all this time, gets highlighted on our show here, although
4609920	4613880	we've talked about it very fondly before, even if Dark Sakura somehow missed it.
4613880	4617480	That's okay, you know what, I played it a little bit, I like rented it once, and played
4617480	4621040	the crap out of it for like five days, and then, you know, sent it back, but I never
4621040	4622040	beat the game.
4622040	4625040	Loki, on the other hand, I know this is one of his all-time favorites, if I'm not mistaken,
4625040	4626040	right?
4626040	4627040	Hell yeah, I finished the game.
4627040	4630400	Alright, I see some people in chat calling it a good entry-level RPG, and a lot of folks
4630400	4634840	in chat really like this as the classic game of the week, so there you go.
4634840	4636840	Super Mario RPG, the classic game of the week.
4636840	4640440	Alright, that's gonna do it for this part A of Orange Lawns Radio tonight, but don't
4640440	4643800	go anywhere, because when we come back in part B, we have your Twitter topics, some
4643800	4649080	rapid-fire news tonight, and some news about Facebook and Twitter on Xbox Live, some dates
4649080	4653480	for when you can expect to see that, and Rock Band, coming to the iPhone.
4653480	4658600	We talked a little bit about iPhone games, now a big, big title is coming its way to
4658600	4662480	the iPhone, so we'll be kind of talking about if folks are looking forward to that, or if
4662480	4664020	this just sounds like shit.
4664020	4668400	We'll talk about that all in a little bit when we come back with more of Orange Lounge
4668400	4675720	Radio, so stay tuned.
4675720	4680760	And welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio, live on this October 11th, 2009, here
4680760	4687360	for episode number 340 of our weekly podcast, which we've taped since May, I'm sorry, June
4687360	4690040	of 2002.
4690040	4693320	During the break there, something I don't think we've done in quite some time in the
4693320	4698320	history of our show, Loki actually played a game live and provided us all of the break
4698320	4700560	music tonight, and we played some DJ Hero.
4700560	4704560	I am so sorry to the podcast listeners, but due to copyright restrictions, we can't play
4704560	4708480	any more than we did in part A for you guys, although I hear guys in our chat room were
4708480	4714600	bootlegging that, and we don't condone that, but if you know who to talk to, there's really
4714600	4717840	nothing we can do about it if some of those bootlegs get out, so there you go.
4717840	4721520	But I posed a question to chat, what you guys thought of that, and we were talking here
4721520	4725720	in the studio, the soundtrack's really hot, that third song, especially the Satisfaction
4725720	4731040	versus Boom Boom Pow, the Black Eyed Peas are kind of hit and miss for me, I think they
4731040	4735280	play them way too much on the radio and you kind of get sick of them, but I love how these
4735280	4741160	songs give a whole new look to these songs, and even some folks in chat were saying about
4741160	4745160	that Hollaback Girl song, that's the best they've ever heard that song.
4745160	4750320	And not everything in those songs were just a part of the soundtrack, you were actually
4750320	4753120	rewinding, you were doing the freestyle horns, right?
4753120	4756800	Freestyle, and then also there's parts where you can distort it, and I was using the Effector
4756800	4760800	dial on there to distort some of the tracks in there too.
4760800	4763740	So there's a lot of stuff that you can kind of add on top of it, and actually there's
4763740	4767800	a port in there where you can add a microphone too, I think a headset microphone, if you
4767800	4773160	want to talk over stuff, but that's tough enough, but yeah, I did screw up a few spots
4773160	4778480	where it dropped out, it's really touchy, it's sensitive to where, and the scratches
4778480	4783360	too early sometimes, but it's fun, and we'll have to definitely do it again once we get
4783360	4784880	the full game.
4784880	4789000	Now Bobby does want me to say in chat, obviously All Games Radio would prefer no bootlegs be
4789000	4793920	released as we could be held liable just saying, yeah, so obviously I was kidding before, so
4793920	4797440	don't release bootlegs because we don't want the fine folks to host our show here.
4797440	4801560	A lot of these songs I think are already out there, like in numerous gameplay clips.
4801560	4807440	I was commenting that I think that the Hollaback Boy Girl would and whatever, that I have a
4807440	4811660	very similar mashup on a disc that I bought in Berkeley.
4811660	4815200	And honestly this is all just promotion for Activision anyway, because honestly if I wasn't
4815200	4819760	sold on this game already, I am fucking buying this day one now, so, and I think a lot of
4819760	4823280	folks in chat that were skeptical about the soundtrack have probably, you know, for the
4823280	4828600	most part been overwhelmingly approved, so we've done a good thing for Activision here,
4828600	4832720	but still for legal reasons, yeah, we said what we said.
4832720	4837640	So, let's see, what else, yeah, DJ Dark Knight says don't copy that floppy.
4837640	4844160	Back to the songs, let's see, Cheeseburger does say sorry but I hate those songs set
4844160	4847880	for the synth in Satisfaction, which is a part of the original song anyway.
4847880	4851160	There's, well they have a lot of stuff, like there's some hip hop songs in there that I'm
4851160	4855960	not going to be too excited to play, but you know, there's a lot of songs like this, like
4855960	4859120	the Daft Punk stuff, I'm all over the Daft Punk stuff, that's going to be awesome.
4859120	4861960	And of course we have downloadable stuff on the horizon too, right?
4861960	4862960	Yeah.
4862960	4863960	Eventually.
4863960	4864960	Eventually.
4864960	4865960	Yeah.
4865960	4866960	Hopefully so.
4866960	4867960	Hopefully there's a lot.
4867960	4868960	This game looks pretty hot.
4868960	4873560	I'm a little sad I didn't get to play, but even just watching was fun, so there you go.
4873560	4874560	So, alright.
4874560	4878960	Well, we do have plenty more going on in the world than just DJ Hero and part of that is
4878960	4884480	going to the Twitter and reading some of your Twitter topics for tonight.
4884480	4890280	And there's a lot of DJ Hero talk on our Twitter feed right now, but we do have some questions.
4890280	4892200	Let's get to some quick Twitter topics tonight.
4892200	4897760	Ryan Belknap on Twitter at Twitter.com slash O-L-R. Uh oh, I have the hiccups, worst thing
4897760	4898760	in radio to have.
4898760	4902840	Excuse me, wants to know, what do you think about all of the games that were pushed back
4902840	4903840	over the last month?
4903840	4905160	Will they be worth the wait?
4905160	4906160	Loki?
4906160	4910240	There's a lot that I was waiting for to come out that have been pushed back, like Red Dead
4910240	4914680	to Redemption, which I'm very excited to play because it's Grand Theft Auto in the Wild
4914680	4916480	West.
4916480	4922200	And also, I'm trying to think of other stuff I was waiting for that are, I'm kind of glad
4922200	4925880	a lot of it's been pushed back because I don't have the money to buy all these right now.
4925880	4931420	Like I'll be picking up Borderlands probably in two weeks, I'll be picking up DJ Hero hopefully
4931420	4934820	earlier than that.
4934820	4938920	And I think those two right there are going to pretty much wrap up my year as far as what
4938920	4946060	I'm buying, you know, Left 4 Dead, well maybe New Super Mario Brothers, I'm on the fence
4946060	4952560	with that, like probably won't buy it, but you know, at least DJ Hero and Borderlands
4952560	4955960	are the two that I'm looking forward to right now, but there's a lot of stuff that's coming
4955960	4961920	out like Dead Rising 2 next year, just a ton of stuff that was coming out this fourth quarter
4961920	4963360	that's now pushed back.
4963360	4966560	I'm okay with games getting pushed back because honestly I have barely enough time to play
4966560	4970120	the games that are out there already, especially when you have a game like Demon's Souls, it's
4970120	4973440	going to take me 100 hours just to get to level 2.
4973440	4977720	You know, there's not, my gaming time's kind of spread out, but then again 2010's just
4977720	4978720	going to look worse.
4978720	4981640	I was looking forward to Blur, I'm kind of sad that that game got pushed back, but you
4981640	4984600	know, DJ Hero's going to be really cool and there's still some stuff coming out.
4984600	4987520	And some of the games I bought already are really taking my time.
4987520	4993560	So, Gamer Girl on Twitter wants to know, what's anyone's favorite video game soundtrack?
4993560	4995360	Favorite video game soundtrack?
4995360	4998940	Beatmania 2DX 5th style is one of my favorites.
4998940	5003760	I can't really think about the dancing games, the music games, considering.
5003760	5008520	So I'm going to say that as far as a soundtrack that I can just sit and listen to over and
5008520	5012000	over again, probably, um, Klonoa.
5012000	5013000	Hmm.
5013000	5014000	Okay.
5014000	5015440	Klonoa or Chrono Trigger.
5015440	5016440	Good choice.
5016440	5021180	I would, I'm going to be just total stereotypical and go with the Final Fantasy series.
5021180	5024240	Just because the Final Fantasy, you know, especially series like Final Fantasy XI,
5024240	5027480	you know, you do listen to that music so often when you play those games that it has to have
5027480	5031880	good music, so I would say a game like Final Fantasy XI or probably my favorite soundtrack
5031880	5034360	in the entire series was VI, Final Fantasy VI.
5034360	5040600	I'd have to go with VI, although the spin-off soundtracks were pretty good, like, um, Final
5040600	5042480	Fantasy, Prey, and Celtic Moon.
5042480	5043480	Both fantastic.
5043480	5045760	Loki, any favorites for you?
5045760	5054480	Um, I don't know, like, I'd say maybe DDR 5th or Max 2 would probably be my favorite
5054480	5055480	soundtracks.
5055480	5058440	Um, Katamari's pretty good.
5058440	5060240	I don't know.
5060240	5062960	Spazinator has two quick topics for us.
5062960	5065880	Your video game related pet peeves.
5065880	5070060	Mine would be, um, arcades replacing arcade machines with redemption machines.
5070060	5071720	That's a pet peeve of mine.
5071720	5075280	I mean, I understand why it's happening, but it's still a pet peeve.
5075280	5078820	Mine are programmed in quarter drainers for arcades.
5078820	5087760	For console, um, it would be, um, oh, you know, I really don't know.
5087760	5089400	Probably bad voice acting.
5089400	5094600	Um, my other pet peeve would be Xbox Live Griefers, just the people on there and go,
5094600	5099360	you know, NNNFFF, you know, you know what I mean.
5099360	5103440	Fixing stuff that doesn't need to be fixed or just, you know, not adding features that
5103440	5105100	should be completely simple to add.
5105100	5111520	For example, Grand Theft Auto 4, um, the multiplayer, you can set your time limits, you know, for
5111520	5119360	5, 10, 15 minutes, 20 minutes, 30 minutes, and then it jumps to 45 minutes.
5119360	5122760	If you want to play a 35 minute game, you have to play two games, and it's annoying.
5122760	5126440	Like in Saints Row, you can play anything from a 1 minute long game to a 60 minute game
5126440	5129520	and just set it any amount of time in between, and I don't understand why they have to take
5129520	5130520	that out.
5130520	5133960	Or, when they updated for Lost and Damned, let's remove the helicopters out of free mode.
5133960	5135320	Yeah, that's an awesome idea.
5135320	5136320	Why the hell did you do that?
5136320	5137880	It's just, there's no point.
5137880	5141480	Uh, we'll let Spaznator have a second question here on Twitter Topics tonight, because he
5141480	5145280	managed to fit two questions in 140 characters, so we'll let him do it.
5145280	5148880	What each console and their respective services can do to improve.
5148880	5150840	What could each console do to improve?
5150840	5153720	Anyone want to tackle this first?
5153720	5155400	What can each console do to improve?
5155400	5156400	Yeah, what could the Wii do?
5156400	5157400	What could the 360 do?
5157400	5158840	What could the PS3 do?
5158840	5163700	Well, the Wii, first of all, could have online play.
5163700	5169800	The Xbox 360 can, I don't know, they're pretty damn awesome.
5169800	5172080	I guess have better filters.
5172080	5175760	And the PS3 can be a different system.
5175760	5178600	Loki?
5178600	5185040	The Wii needs an actual online something, other than just browsing a flash, not even
5185040	5188800	a flash, like a JavaScript store for games and stuff.
5188800	5193560	They need something more substantial, like the PlayStation Network and Xbox Live.
5193560	5197600	PlayStation Network needs more download content on there, as far as game releases and stuff
5197600	5204520	like that, because Xbox Live has at least one or two new games coming out each week.
5204520	5208920	You'd be lucky to find that over on the PlayStation Network, and I understand that they have PlayStation
5208920	5213360	Originals and stuff like that, but come on, a little bit more and more demos for that
5213360	5215000	kind of stuff.
5215000	5224200	And then Xbox Live, I would say probably a way to purchase stuff where I don't have to
5224200	5228760	just buy points in a big lot, like how the PlayStation Network has it, if the purchase
5228760	5233200	is over $5, I can pay for the exact amount and be done with it, and that'd be nice, instead
5233200	5235360	of having all these extra points lying around.
5235360	5239360	I hate doing the point conversion crap.
5239360	5242640	I definitely have the definitive answers, in my opinion, for these three consoles.
5242640	5247700	The Wii needs to embrace online, period, Nintendo needs to stop being afraid of online and see
5247700	5252980	how it can work for them in large doses, but I honestly don't think the Wii can be remedied
5252980	5253980	in its current state.
5253980	5257320	I think it is what it is, I think it's been pigeon-holed for what it is, it's not necessarily
5257320	5260920	a bad thing, it is the number one console in America right now, whether we like it or
5260920	5265980	not as hardcore gamers, but I would say if they want to woo the hardcore gamers back,
5265980	5270420	they're going to need to fix some things with Wii HD, which we all know is inevitable.
5270420	5272880	Question three, I couldn't disagree with Dark Sakura more.
5272880	5277200	I think they did exactly what they needed to do this year, and that was drop the price
5277200	5280800	to a reasonable point, and I think they're on a path for success right now.
5280800	5283240	I think the PS3's been doing a lot right this year.
5283240	5285640	PSP Go, completely different story.
5285640	5289920	PS3, I think, is a console I would recommend to friends this Christmas.
5289920	5294320	The biggest thing they could do now, focus on working, selling those consoles, and getting
5294320	5297760	more exclusives would be the biggest thing they could do right now.
5297760	5301400	Yeah, my PS3 is a Blu-ray player.
5301400	5306120	See now, I can't say that, because especially now that my 360's been broken, I've been able
5306120	5307840	to value the PlayStation more as-
5307840	5314160	Now, tell me, when your Xbox 360 is fixed, is that going to change?
5314160	5318200	Are you going to immediately remember everything that you liked better about the Xbox 360?
5318200	5322000	It'll be about half and half, because here's my thing for the 360, and yes, there will
5322000	5328640	be games that I will buy on the PlayStation 3 over the 360, because this 360 lacks hardcore
5328640	5333920	in this one place, and what the 360 needs to fix, anyone?
5333920	5337400	The controller sucks on the Xbox 360.
5337400	5338800	I disagree.
5338800	5339800	Especially the D-pad.
5339800	5340800	The D-pad is ass.
5340800	5341800	The D-pad is horrible.
5341800	5342800	I disagree.
5342800	5343800	You can't play retro games.
5343800	5344800	Oh my, really?
5344800	5345800	Why?
5345800	5348960	I've had actually absolutely no problem playing on the Xbox 360.
5348960	5353800	The controller size, first of all, is more comfortable to the shape of my hands.
5353800	5357120	Why else do you think that I like the Saturn dual analog controller, even though that one
5357120	5361040	seemed kind of, you know, on the unwieldy side when you look at it?
5361040	5365520	It actually, everything, like I was playing through just a number of games and having
5365520	5369600	a zero problem, like, well, Dan had problems with Mr. Driller, I didn't.
5369600	5373740	I mean, it may just be I've got, you know, smaller hands than both of you guys, but I
5373740	5378700	don't really have much of a problem with playing games on the Xbox 360.
5378700	5386520	I actually hate a lot of the PS3 games just because, I mean, first of all, they'll rely
5386520	5391180	on different visual effects that the Xbox 360 just doesn't need.
5391180	5396120	And also, in comparison, there's certain games that are coming out, namely Bayonetta, that
5396120	5402360	is going to be completely utter crap on PS3 as opposed to Xbox 360, both in terms of graphics,
5402360	5407840	processor speed, you know, how the game functions on the system.
5407840	5413160	So honestly, I think that the Xbox 360 controller, to me, is more comfortable in my hands.
5413160	5421520	That's why I got this on Xbox 360, as in Marvel Ultimate Alliance 2, instead of PlayStation
5421520	5427240	3, which I've played the first one on both systems, and to this day, the control is infinitely
5427240	5429560	better on the Xbox 360.
5429560	5434360	Just playing Mega Man 9 on the 360 controller and playing it on a PS3 controller made me
5434360	5437160	want to just build my own 360 controller.
5437160	5439240	I just cannot play some games on the 360.
5439240	5440240	I'm not hating on Microsoft.
5440240	5441240	They do a lot right.
5441240	5445600	I mean, to be fair, if I'm picking on that, there's, I mean, 360's done a lot of brilliant
5445600	5446600	things this year.
5446600	5447860	One versus 100 was awesome.
5447860	5452760	They continue to lead the charge in online gaming, but, you know, if I could fix something,
5452760	5455080	that would be the first place to start as a new controller.
5455080	5457600	Well, third parties make other controllers, I think.
5457600	5459300	Doesn't Hori make one as well, or?
5459300	5464160	I don't think any of them really just radically change the design, though.
5464160	5466400	So anyhow.
5466400	5469000	And Brad, you know, you have a fan in, uh, Brad from Pod Culture.
5469000	5473040	He says he prefers the 360 controller over the PS3 any day.
5473040	5474040	Yeah.
5474040	5475040	How about the noise of the system?
5475040	5478080	That would be the other thing I'd want to fix, is that when I am trying to watch Netflix
5478080	5482080	or movies on the 360, it sounds like Mom's running the vacuum cleaner behind me.
5482080	5483080	I don't notice.
5483080	5484080	Really?
5484080	5486960	Well, keep in mind how my setup is.
5486960	5493040	I have everything together under the, uh, the drawer on there, so really, I don't really
5493040	5494040	hear it.
5494040	5500520	The only time that I hear it is when we have the subwoofer off, and the game volume very
5500520	5506000	low, and my hearing is extra sensitive, or, you know, that type of thing.
5506000	5511560	Or if, like, someone's turned off the TV and left the system on, or if the game is on pause,
5511560	5512560	then I hear the system.
5512560	5515280	But I don't really hear it when I'm playing.
5515280	5520240	Then again, we've got the surround sound setup and everything, too, so it's hard to hear
5520240	5521240	yourself breathe.
5521240	5522240	All right.
5522240	5528880	One more question here, Surtur from our Twitter wants to know, are PSP mini games too expensive?
5528880	5533440	Are the regular PSN download games too expensive in comparison to the UMD prices?
5533440	5535480	Yes and yes.
5535480	5536480	That's his opinion.
5536480	5540480	Um, for me, I don't, I can't answer this, and I doubt the others can, too.
5540480	5542000	I haven't played a PSP mini game yet.
5542000	5543300	I haven't paid to download one.
5543300	5546560	I couldn't tell you if they're worth the money or not, so I don't know.
5546560	5548760	I keep forgetting they exist.
5548760	5555560	I do think people forget what $5 or $10 is supposed to get you.
5555560	5562960	And honestly, I think $10 is not that much money for a video game, and, you know, considering
5562960	5567560	that most games now cost $60 used, I think most of these arcade games, I mean, this goes
5567560	5573160	for Xbox Live and the minis or what have you, $10 for a game is not unreasonable, especially
5573160	5575760	if the game's good.
5575760	5576760	But I don't know.
5576760	5579000	I haven't played any PSP mini games, so I couldn't tell you.
5579000	5583880	As far as the regular PSN download games too expensive in comparison to UMD prices, I,
5583880	5584880	you know what?
5584880	5589240	I'm all for the PSN download thing for convenience, but I'm also all for competition, and this
5589240	5595200	is why I do not like the PSP Go, and I don't really care for where it's headed with games.
5595200	5600080	I don't like the fact that there's only one source to buy the games, and it is, you know,
5600080	5604720	something I haven't given a lot of thought to until the system was released, but competition
5604720	5610160	is usually a pretty healthy thing, and, you know, if this digital distribution thing keeps
5610160	5615520	going and, you know, online is the only place we're able to buy games, that is, through
5615520	5620560	Sony or through Microsoft in the future, if they do something similar, that's gonna be
5620560	5624960	a little worrisome, because competition right now is what keeps things awesome.
5624960	5631600	What's a website like CheapAssGamer gonna do if all the consoles go digital distribution?
5631600	5635960	There's always gonna be older stuff that's out there, so, and I don't think it's ever
5635960	5642040	gonna go away completely, because GameStop's not gonna let it go away completely, so, and
5642040	5646360	despite every nice thing I said about PlayStation 3 earlier, I still think the PSP Go is a big
5646360	5652760	joke, and if you want to get a PSP, get a PSP 3000, and I would recommend a PSP 3000,
5652760	5654760	but I would not recommend a PSP Go.
5654760	5659120	All right, um, that's enough for Twitter topics, we talked a lot about those Twitter topics.
5659120	5665280	Let's move on with some rapid-fire news tonight on Orange Lawn's radio.
5665280	5667360	Loki, start us off with some quick news.
5667360	5672760	Well, I may not support the iPhone, they are getting a lot of games, and one game that
5672760	5677640	I like that's pretty awesome, Command & Conquer Red Alert will now be coming to the iPhone
5677640	5684520	this October, and will feature 12 levels in the game, and looks pretty awesome from the
5684520	5688800	screenshots, so, you know, hey, Red Alert's awesome, so definitely worth checking it out,
5688800	5694280	and, you know, with the touchscreen and everything, it should be perfect, since this is an RTS.
5694280	5701360	There is a fan movie released this week, actually kind of a mini Turbo, the movie, kind of showing
5701360	5707320	what a Street Fighter-esque type game would be played like in the future, and kind of
5707320	5714880	revolves around, you know, this player who's, you know, almost like a plot to, say, The
5714880	5719680	Wizard or something like that, you know, he's getting better at this one game in order to
5719680	5726520	fight somebody in this competition, and it's pretty neat because, I guess, his brother
5726520	5731920	in the movie or something was like a Tae Kwon Do master or something like that, and so now
5731920	5736880	he's getting trained from him to fight in this game and stuff, but the movie itself
5736880	5743600	is available online for free, or you can grab a DVD for it, and it actually, you know, it's
5743600	5751760	got a pretty decent story to it, and I think 20 minutes or so, so yeah, 23 minutes, so
5751760	5756160	definitely worth checking it out, and you can check it out at turbothemovie.com, so
5756160	5757880	that's pretty sweet.
5757880	5765480	Finally, there is a Resistance 3 billboard that's been spotted, and apparently this is
5765480	5770280	part of a background for a movie coming out called Battle of Los Angeles, which is due
5770280	5774840	out in 2011, although it's not really a big surprise that, you know, Resistance would
5774840	5781960	be, you know, Resistance 3 would be coming out eventually, but it's surprising, I guess,
5781960	5786360	to see a billboard for it, and apparently I do see something that was blacked out that
5786360	5788960	looks like a website, so interesting.
5788960	5794200	Alright, I got some rapid-fire news for you guys tonight, starting off with some Rockband
5794200	5795200	updates.
5795200	5798080	Here's some of the tracks coming to Rockband next week, October 13th, if you're on the
5798080	5800760	360 or the 15th, if you're on the PS3.
5800760	5805040	There's a Brutal Legend pack making its way out, coming with Motorhead, We Are The Road
5805040	5809840	Crew 08, Testament, More Than Meets The Eye, and of course Tenacious D with the metal,
5809840	5812880	since, you know, Jack Black is one of the voices in Brutal Legend.
5812880	5818240	Some other individual songs coming out for the bands Black Tide, Joe Satriani, Kansas,
5818240	5821520	L7, and Blink-182 with What's My Age Again.
5821520	5823800	That was one of the videos you would see on TV all the time.
5823800	5826260	So I bet L7's is Pretend That We're Dead.
5826260	5827260	That's already in the game.
5827260	5830080	And, well, then the other...
5830080	5831920	Andres is the song that's coming.
5831920	5834780	So there it is.
5834780	5840360	In other news, Jordan Mechner has filed a trademark for Prince of Persia, The Forgotten
5840360	5841360	Sands.
5841360	5844480	Of course, Jordan Mechner is the creator of the Prince of Persia series, after all.
5844480	5850040	So that may be something where, I don't know if that's something where the new Prince of
5850040	5851440	Persia series is headed.
5851440	5853320	That also might tie in with the movie, too.
5853320	5856840	That is very true, is that it could be a sequel to the movie that's coming out this year.
5856840	5859920	I think Sands of Time is what it's based on.
5859920	5865440	So it sounds like it could be a tie-in movie or maybe the next Prince of Persia game.
5865440	5866440	You never know.
5866440	5870840	But just so it's also stated, though, Mechner did once file a trademark called Prince of
5870840	5876060	Persia Prodigy that was never brought to light, at least as of yet.
5876060	5878680	So who knows if that will come to light at all.
5878680	5882160	And one more story for you real quick about the game Rocket Knight.
5882160	5883280	It's coming back.
5883280	5889680	Xbox Live, PlayStation Network, and Steam will be seeing this game in 2010.
5889680	5893640	This is coming from Konami, has made this game.
5893640	5897600	It's going to be on Xbox Live Arcade and all that good stuff in early 2010.
5897600	5898600	It is not a remake.
5898600	5904400	It is a sequel 15 years after the last Rocket Knight.
5904400	5905400	It looks pretty sweet, too.
5905400	5907200	Have you seen the screenshots or trailer yet?
5907200	5910320	I've just seen one screenshot, but I haven't seen the trailer.
5910320	5911320	It looks neat.
5911320	5912320	I don't know.
5912320	5913320	I never played the original.
5913320	5914320	Did you play it?
5914320	5915320	No.
5915320	5917600	Is this something Dark Sakura maybe played at all?
5917600	5918600	Rocket Knight?
5918600	5919600	No.
5919600	5920600	All right.
5920600	5922360	Well, Climax is developing the game.
5922360	5925160	They were the folks buying Silent Hill Origins.
5925160	5926840	So there you go.
5926840	5928480	Dark Sakura!
5928480	5936720	Well, for news of Halo 3 ODST, they actually made up...
5936720	5939800	Sorry, I'm getting dinged.
5939800	5941800	My apologies.
5941800	5949480	Actually are getting hit a 27 million game sold, which is pretty good.
5949480	5953920	So I'm sorry, that's total Halo game sold is up to 27 million.
5953920	5961960	Actually for ODST, 2.5 million copies have been sold within the last two weeks.
5961960	5964840	Also there's to be a little bit more for it.
5964840	5970880	That means that we're going to be potentially seeing Master Chief come out in one of the
5970880	5973580	future expansions.
5973580	5979200	And they also know that there were a few cliffhangers that need to be resolved.
5979200	5984660	But they're saying that they have a plan that's going out at least six years.
5984660	5989920	And it actually is going to tie in all the canon, including comic books and novels.
5989920	5992400	That sounds ambitious.
5992400	5997080	Also for Marvel Ultimate Alliance 2, they're getting Carnage.
5997080	6004280	And Carnage is, well, as everyone hopes, not just another Spider-Man and not just another
6004280	6011480	Venom but full on psycho, crazy, honorless, vicious, did I say crazy?
6011480	6012480	Because I mean crazy.
6012480	6014880	Carnage is fucking nuts.
6014880	6015880	So yeah.
6015880	6017240	Begetting Carnage.
6017240	6018680	Woot.
6018680	6025660	And then Activision filed a particular trademark for a particular adaptation of a particular
6025660	6028340	game to be made into a movie.
6028340	6031000	And that would be Call of Duty.
6031000	6040360	So I actually were, some of the people behind it were actually leaving hints about talking
6040360	6043360	with different directors already.
6043360	6044880	Cool.
6044880	6049120	All right.
6049120	6050960	That would be it for my quickie stuff.
6050960	6054280	That would be interesting for a Call of Duty movie, but I suppose it's inevitable because
6054280	6055280	the series is huge.
6055280	6057560	I think Call of Duty would make a great movie.
6057560	6060840	At least with Call of Duty, there is an actual storyline that goes along with it.
6060840	6065840	It's not like, you know, okay, let's make a war movie and call it Call of Duty.
6065840	6067120	I still wouldn't see it.
6067120	6068440	I'm not a big fan of war movies.
6068440	6069440	Exactly.
6069440	6070440	I like chick flicks.
6070440	6071440	All right.
6071440	6072440	Call of Duty, the chick flick?
6072440	6076080	No, they don't need to do Call of Duty, the chick flick.
6076080	6077080	That would be pretty funny.
6077080	6081540	You know, Final Fantasy is kind of a chick flick in some ways, especially emo ones like
6081540	6082860	Final Fantasy 7.
6082860	6085520	If they turn Final Fantasy 7 into a movie, that's kind of a chick flick.
6085520	6086520	A little bit.
6086520	6092520	They have, it's, you know, Advent Children wasn't so much a chick flick as it was just
6092520	6093520	confusing.
6093520	6094520	It was nonstop.
6094520	6095520	Action is what it was.
6095520	6096520	It doesn't need a plot.
6096520	6097520	It's just ass kickery.
6097520	6098520	In your face, ass kicking action.
6098520	6099520	Cloud is emo.
6099520	6100520	Vincent is dark.
6100520	6101520	Cloud is emo.
6101520	6102520	Vincent is dark.
6102520	6103520	Look.
6103520	6104520	Three sephiroths.
6104520	6107520	Three sephirbrats.
6107520	6108520	All right.
6108520	6109520	The end.
6109520	6110520	Exactly.
6110520	6111520	P.S.
6111520	6112520	Aerith is dead.
6112520	6113520	P.S.
6113520	6114520	Laura Klaw says I like the Twilight movies.
6114520	6115520	Wrong.
6115520	6116520	Ew.
6116520	6117520	Ew.
6117520	6118520	Ew.
6118520	6119520	Sparkly vampires for the lose.
6119520	6120520	No, no.
6120520	6122760	I'm not a fan of the Twilight movies.
6122760	6123760	I tried.
6123760	6126360	Did I tell you I sat down and tried to read the first book?
6126360	6127560	And I wanted to.
6127560	6128780	Did you notice it?
6128780	6132980	I'm glad it wasn't my book because it probably would have been the first book I ever burned.
6132980	6137240	I've never read the book, but my wife asks, and she's, you know, show me parts.
6137240	6138240	She's like, look at this.
6138240	6140920	It's like they don't have an editor for this book.
6140920	6146900	so many grammar and spelling and it just doesn't make any sense.
6146900	6147900	Back to video games.
6147900	6148900	Sorry.
6148900	6150940	Just proving how crappy it is.
6150940	6153560	Something not crappy though would be TrackMania.
6153560	6160760	And Ubisoft has acquired the developer of TrackMania, Nadeo, and apparently they're
6160760	6164240	doing it to build some online cred.
6164240	6169240	And I hope this means that we do get a console version of TrackMania 2 because it looks absolutely
6169240	6170240	awesome.
6170240	6174320	It's supposed to start racing with kind of the Forza 3 graphics, so hey, that's not a
6174320	6176400	bad combo whatsoever.
6176400	6181080	And they say, through Nadeo, Ubisoft will gain an expert team, one of the best online
6181080	6186240	technologies around, as well as a flagship multiplayer game that enjoys an unrivaled
6186240	6190880	reputation among the loyal and committed community.
6190880	6194400	And yeah, so awesome.
6194400	6198280	It doesn't look like they're going to be canceling any TrackMania games, and hopefully we'll
6198280	6200060	see this come to consoles.
6200060	6204120	That's what I'm really hoping for, because the DS version was awesome, but not as good
6204120	6206720	as a console release.
6206720	6208720	All right.
6208720	6212520	Well moving on to Facebook and Twitter on the Xbox 360.
6212520	6214800	This is something a lot of folks have been looking forward to.
6214800	6219520	Of course, Last.fm would be a part of this as well, but speaking specifically of Facebook
6219520	6225640	and Twitter, there was a splash page spotted on Xbox Live's UK portal saying that the service
6225640	6228100	is going to launch November 17th.
6228100	6233420	Now of course, again, this was on the UK portal, but if I'm not mistaken, don't you get these
6233420	6234960	updates worldwide?
6234960	6236920	So if they get on the 17th, we would too?
6236920	6237920	Pretty much, yeah.
6237920	6238920	It'd be relatively close.
6238920	6239920	Yeah.
6239920	6241240	So that's what they're saying.
6241240	6245040	This was spotted in a screenshot on the flash page, if you zoom in a lot there.
6245040	6248300	And it is just assumed, even though Last.fm isn't featured on there, that this update
6248300	6251420	is going to include that as well.
6251420	6255040	So there was a little firmware update that went out not that long ago, kind of prepping
6255040	6257360	the Xbox 360 for this.
6257360	6260720	So this is going to be on its way, and that's assumed in November.
6260720	6264120	I guess there's also going to be a beta test I was reading somewhere at the end of October
6264120	6268280	for these services, but I'm kind of eh on these.
6268280	6272000	I think the one cool thing would be maybe like taking screenshots and publishing them
6272000	6273000	to Facebook.
6273000	6274000	That'd be cool.
6274000	6278600	But I don't see this being something I would want to use.
6278600	6282400	And what I really don't want to happen is I don't want it to turn into, with all due
6282400	6284720	respect to the people that made it, Raptor.
6284720	6288320	Like I don't want my Xbox 360 tweeting every time I put in a new game.
6288320	6290200	Because I know that's just going to irritate people.
6290200	6293980	And part of the reason I'm really starting to hate Twitter is that there's no filters.
6293980	6296680	Like Facebook is basically Twitter, but with filters.
6296680	6300120	But you can also use TweetDeck.
6300120	6305020	But even with TweetDeck, you can filter a certain person's tweets, which I do use.
6305020	6307040	But you can't filter the type.
6307040	6310520	If a person just posts annoying things over and over, I just unfollow them.
6310520	6311520	Exactly.
6311520	6313140	Like, I'm sorry, but it's just Twitter.
6313140	6318660	Like if you're going to get butthurt over me unfollowing you, get something real to
6318660	6322040	worry about, like Darfur or something.
6322040	6323040	I don't know.
6323040	6325840	But don't worry about me unfriending you on Twitter.
6325840	6327640	It just means you post a lot of crap.
6327640	6333080	So unfortunately, Twitter not having filters makes it really inferior to Facebook.
6333080	6336480	And hopefully there'll be a magic button where I can just block all the 360 updates from
6336480	6338260	Facebook if they're annoying.
6338260	6340840	But if they aren't, then maybe I'll keep it around.
6340840	6341960	We'll see.
6341960	6345440	So Last.fm on the other hand sounds very cool, because I'm already using Last.fm.
6345440	6347720	I have like 3,000 plays chalked up on there.
6347720	6350240	And God, some people have way more than that.
6350240	6353480	And I think Last.fm has a really good recommendation service.
6353480	6355040	I prefer it to Pandora.
6355040	6358040	I know a lot of people disagree with me and think Pandora is God.
6358040	6361280	But I like that Last.fm kind of bases its recommendations off of what you already play.
6361280	6363640	I use Last.fm at work sometimes.
6363640	6365680	Pandora is really useless to me.
6365680	6366880	Why is it blocked or something?
6366880	6367880	On my phone.
6367880	6368880	Oh.
6368880	6369880	They do have a Pandora app on the phone.
6369880	6370880	I know, but it's useless to me on my phone.
6370880	6374680	And I prefer using Last.fm, because if I want to listen to the stuff that I've been listening
6374680	6378400	to at home, then I may not have moved on to my iPhone then.
6378400	6382280	And of course, they have an Enflow station.
6382280	6384520	So I think Last.fm is pretty cool.
6384520	6386400	I'm excited to see how it works on Xbox.
6386400	6388240	I hope I can use it for background music.
6388240	6389240	We'll see.
6389240	6393680	But anyhow, that is all coming soon for Xbox Live Gold members getting a sneak peek.
6393680	6398660	But it sounds like everybody will get to access it on November 17th in the UK.
6398660	6401440	I'm sure the rest of us, hopefully, around the same time.
6401440	6407560	SHJ100Matt says in our chat room, chat.orangehonestrader.com, I really hope this doesn't open my gamertag
6407560	6409520	to the cam whores and porn spammers.
6409520	6411800	Oh, I hope so too.
6411800	6416900	But seeing as you have to follow them in order to see the messages on Twitter, hopefully,
6416900	6419020	you know.
6419020	6423400	And SalaciousPopInChat, I like this comment, LOL, it's not like LiveJournal where it's
6423400	6426140	a grievous offense to de-friend someone.
6426140	6430040	I totally agree because I totally get butthurt when people de-friend me on LiveJournal.
6430040	6431040	It's like, what did I do?
6431040	6433040	I'm doing it right now, Rob.
6433040	6434040	No, don't cry.
6434040	6436480	No, I do get butthurt when people un-friend me on LiveJournal.
6436480	6439000	But I put a lot more of myself out there on LiveJournal.
6439000	6441880	Twitter, I agree, is bullshit.
6441880	6445880	Facebook, I always kind of wonder why someone would de-friend me on Facebook because it's
6445880	6446880	just Facebook.
6446880	6451120	But LiveJournal, I actually kind of get butthurt because I have a friends-only journal.
6451120	6454700	And so if I let someone in to read it all and then they just leave, I'm kind of sad.
6454700	6459280	So I like to know why or, you know, I'm a big boy.
6459280	6460500	Tell me if you're unfollowing me.
6460500	6465480	You post too many, you know, memes or you post too many advertisements for your LiveJournal
6465480	6466480	games.
6466480	6467480	Please tell me.
6467480	6470240	Rob, I am so tired of that survivor thing.
6470240	6473320	Which by the way, I'm hosting season 18 and we're looking for players.
6473320	6476120	I think it's silly that there are 18 seasons.
6476120	6478960	I, well, there's 20 of the real things, so believe it.
6478960	6479960	All right, anyhow.
6479960	6483840	I'm sad that it caught up that fast.
6483840	6486640	It's just, it's no worse than role-play gaming online.
6486640	6487640	That's what it is.
6487640	6488640	It's role-play gaming.
6488640	6490880	All right, anyway.
6490880	6494280	Ray Ayanami in chat asked, what the hell is FarmVille or Mafia Wars?
6494280	6496540	Well, obviously he has- Boring crap!
6496540	6500920	I will say this though, Bejeweled Blitz got a makeover this week and it's awesome.
6500920	6503160	Oh yeah, my wife's been playing that non-stop.
6503160	6504440	It's awesome!
6504440	6507760	They totally revamped the game and made it more awesomer.
6507760	6511840	Well, Facebook finally did something right, speaking of their little games, that if I
6511840	6516960	don't give a shit about what game you're playing, and by the way, Loki, your wife just posted
6516960	6517960	weird pictures of herself.
6517960	6520960	Wait a minute, did she- Yes, she did.
6520960	6521960	Yes, yes.
6521960	6527920	She, she, I was trying to post my live journal post of my finishing the cabinet and she was
6527920	6531300	sitting next to me because I had my camera there that I had just taken pictures with,
6531300	6535560	taking weird pictures of herself and standing there and going, hey, look at this.
6535560	6536560	Hey, look at this.
6536560	6537560	Hey, look at this.
6537560	6540840	Then she started taking pictures of me too and it was annoying, so.
6540840	6542480	I'm like, knock it off.
6542480	6547640	Okay, what's more annoying, wife taking pictures of you or Farmville?
6547640	6548640	Farmville.
6548640	6549640	Farmville.
6549640	6554040	But actually, someone pointed out to me that you can hide those little app announcements
6554040	6555040	when people announce this shit.
6555040	6556040	Oh yeah, you didn't know that.
6556040	6559240	Well, I didn't think about it, but the ones that were getting me is when you have like
6559240	6565360	up in your little top hand corner, the so-and-so sent you a big pile of poopy from Sorority
6565360	6566360	Life.
6566360	6567360	Yes.
6567360	6570560	And I found, and the thing is, is that I've gone into my settings and blocked the application
6570560	6571840	and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
6571840	6576640	I have a real life, you know, and it still gives me those little invite things whenever
6576640	6579100	people send me the shit I don't care about.
6579100	6584580	So I found that you can go into the little thing there and then block the app from there.
6584580	6588600	I actually do think I did send you a big pile of poop in Sorority Life the other day.
6588600	6590200	So I'm surprised you're not using that too.
6590200	6592160	Speaking of which, oh, I was going to say.
6592160	6594800	I dropped that Sorority Life thing so fast.
6594800	6596040	I did too, finally.
6596040	6597040	I'm done with Sorority Life.
6597040	6603480	My wife is online, probably playing Bejeweled Blitz.
6603480	6605120	Good for her.
6605120	6609800	And not listening to this show, because it's just games, games, games.
6609800	6610800	Exactly.
6610800	6614480	All right, moving on with more news, Dark Sakura.
6614480	6615600	I don't want to.
6615600	6616600	You have to.
6616600	6618600	That's what we do here on the show.
6618600	6619600	Okay.
6619600	6627320	Apparently, Sony and Microsoft don't understand MMOs on a console.
6627320	6633920	This actually was said in an interview from one of the people behind Star Trek Online
6633920	6640000	that the reason the MMO is delayed is because of the business side of things.
6640000	6641560	He says the game runs.
6641560	6642840	The game is there.
6642840	6645720	It runs all of their games.
6645720	6655000	You know, like Champions Online, it runs almost, you know, pretty much all of their MMOs run
6655000	6656000	on the console.
6656000	6661880	It's just that they're trying to get Sony and Microsoft to understand how an MMO works
6661880	6664400	and what helps it make its money.
6664400	6670200	They said that the only ones to come close is maybe Final Fantasy XI and that they had
6670200	6674600	to make a lot of exceptions.
6674600	6680760	So Microsoft would, could establish a market share.
6680760	6689480	I just, I'm like, you know, if you haven't, if, if you are a newbie to the world of MMOs,
6689480	6694600	why don't you let the people who have done them before help you with your business model?
6694600	6697320	Hey, it's worked for this.
6697320	6699360	Why don't you do it this way?
6699360	6704480	It's just, to me, I don't really see any reason why it can't be run like it is on the
6704480	6705800	PC.
6705800	6710040	You know, you buy your game, you pay your subscription fee.
6710040	6711040	What's the big deal?
6711040	6715920	Well, you know, there have been some MMOs on consoles, but you know, they also, like
6715920	6719920	all the good ones I can think of were also on PC, like Final Fantasy XI, which might
6719920	6720920	be the only console MMO.
6720920	6721920	You said that's good?
6721920	6723360	Well, you know, for its time, yes.
6723360	6726240	Although Final Fantasy XIV, I'm all about that.
6726240	6727240	Yes siree.
6727240	6731120	I just still remember the day that you came over here to help me set up some of my stuff
6731120	6737720	on Final Fantasy XI, and I was doing everything on a controller, done all my macros and everything,
6737720	6740560	and you looked at me going, how the fuck are you doing that?
6740560	6742800	I couldn't play that game with a controller.
6742800	6747320	I realized it was made for the PS2, but I could not play that game with a controller.
6747320	6748320	Unpossible.
6748320	6749320	No, no.
6749320	6750320	I was playing on the PC.
6750320	6751320	I know.
6751320	6752320	I know you were.
6752320	6753320	I know you were.
6753320	6754320	Because I've been playing PSO.
6754320	6755320	And I thought you were a crackhead.
6755320	6757780	But hey, I made that shit work.
6757780	6759000	For the week you played, yes.
6759000	6760000	No.
6760000	6761320	That was when I was playing for a few months.
6761320	6765760	I remember once we were in a party in the Valcrum Dunes, and you were, heal please.
6765760	6766840	I was saying that to you.
6766840	6767840	Heal please.
6767840	6769840	And I was like, shut up please.
6769840	6777640	But it really wasn't until I got to World of Warcraft that I had to actually learn how
6777640	6779280	to play with a keyboard.
6779280	6780280	Which sucks.
6780280	6782520	I think MMOs are certainly possible on consoles.
6782520	6785920	Like a console exclusive MMO, and I kind of wish they'd go for it.
6785920	6790120	I think a game like Demon's Souls shows it's possible, even though that's not really an
6790120	6791120	MMO.
6791120	6796800	It is still a massively kind of multiplayer environment, it's just that the game doesn't
6796800	6798440	revolve around the multiplayer.
6798440	6804200	Well, I still, by the way, I'm gonna say to this day that I still wish that World of Warcraft
6804200	6808640	had controller support, and that I'm looking for two months of play, please.
6808640	6810800	Beg, beg, grovel, grovel.
6810800	6813120	Not really.
6813120	6816480	Then my paycheck situation fixes up.
6816480	6818440	I dinged level 45 paladin today.
6818440	6819440	Yay!
6819440	6821360	You know what level my character got to?
6821360	6822360	Seven.
6822360	6823360	Yes, exactly.
6823360	6824640	I know, you mentioned it two weeks ago.
6824640	6825640	I know.
6825640	6827640	And I haven't played in that long.
6827640	6829160	Alright, anyhow, Loki.
6829160	6831320	I haven't played any.
6831320	6833200	You've never played World of Warcraft, huh?
6833200	6834200	No.
6834200	6837960	You sunk like three years, well you suck for one, but you sunk like three years of
6837960	6843600	your life into Final Fantasy XI, and somehow never got sucked into World of Warcraft.
6843600	6844960	It's amazing to me.
6844960	6847800	This is what happens when Rob has a third a glass of wine.
6847800	6848800	Apparently.
6848800	6850400	Final Fantasy XIV, though, I...
6850400	6853280	Well, it won't be okay to drive home.
6853280	6855720	Final Fantasy XIV, though, I don't know.
6855720	6856720	I can't make any promises.
6856720	6858800	Final Fantasy XIV looks so sexy.
6858800	6863840	I'm like, no, you can't do this now!
6863840	6866400	I have a life, I've already moved on.
6866400	6870280	If anything's going to cause a divorce, it's going to be Final Fantasy XIV.
6870280	6871280	Alright.
6871280	6872280	Anyhow.
6872280	6876360	Alright, you better hope it has Bejeweled in it.
6876360	6877360	For your wife.
6877360	6878360	Well, hey, Bejeweled.
6878360	6882360	I showed her the Bejeweled Square Enix game, you remember that?
6882360	6883640	Oh, yeah.
6883640	6885560	But it's Bejeweled Twist, she doesn't like Bejeweled Twist.
6885560	6888360	She's like, ah, I know.
6888360	6889360	Whatever.
6889360	6891680	Um, so, Fifth Cell.
6891680	6895980	They're looking to move on to some other platforms other than the Wii and DS.
6895980	6901240	Their next game, which is pretty big, they say, and unannounced, will be for Xbox Live
6901240	6902520	Arcade.
6902520	6906000	And they go on saying, no, we're doing an Xbox Live Arcade title next, it's going to
6906000	6907000	be pretty big.
6907000	6909100	Wow, that's pretty generic.
6909100	6913160	It's going to be really cool, we're very excited about it, and it's totally not ready to be
6913160	6914160	announced.
6914160	6915480	It's far away.
6915480	6918440	I'm going to take a wild guess and say that it's probably going to look very similar to
6918440	6926160	Draw on the Life and Scribblenauts, since both their games are very similar looking.
6926160	6929200	I'm glad they're not doing the cheap Scribblenauts 2.
6929200	6931560	In fact, I hope they never make a sequel to Scribblenauts.
6931560	6935360	I would like to see more games that they just don't make sequels to.
6935360	6940520	I know that sounds cruel, but, you know, sometimes these series get dug into the ground, you
6940520	6941520	know?
6941520	6942520	Like the Guardian Legend.
6942520	6943520	No!
6943520	6944780	That must have a sequel.
6944780	6948560	That's one of those games where it's like, okay, 25 years later, we need a sequel to
6948560	6949560	that.
6949560	6950560	Or at least a remake.
6950560	6951560	I mean, come on.
6951560	6952560	A reimagining.
6952560	6954120	How about a reimagining?
6954120	6957680	I don't like the word remake as much as I do reimagining, because usually the reimagined
6957680	6959720	games are better, so.
6959720	6963200	Like the Silent Hill game on the Wii, which, that's out very soon, right?
6963200	6964200	On November.
6964200	6966200	Damn, they're going to miss Halloween?
6966200	6967200	Stupids?
6967200	6969200	Yeah, I got delayed.
6969200	6970380	Stupids?
6970380	6972120	Also stupid, in my opinion.
6972120	6975840	Rock Band is on its way to the iPhone, and I don't get it.
6975840	6976840	Like I do and I don't.
6976840	6977840	It's like the PSP version.
6977840	6979920	I under- well, no.
6979920	6980920	Bite your tongue.
6980920	6983660	The PSP version is amplitude or frequency.
6983660	6984960	It is awesome.
6984960	6989720	The iPhone version is just tap tap tap tap tap tap tap on your little screen.
6989720	6995000	It's like Tap Tap Revenge, which is funny for the first few songs you play, but then
6995000	6996280	kind of loses its point.
6996280	7000640	I like Tap Tap Revenge because there were some good songs in it that I could play.
7000640	7001640	That was it.
7001640	7004240	But like Rock Band on the iPhone, okay, look, here it is.
7004240	7007320	Before I give you my opinion, I should give you some of the facts.
7007320	7009400	There is going to be a four-way multiplayer mode.
7009400	7014000	It's all done over Bluetooth, and then you're going to have 20 games, which apparently are
7014000	7015640	all in the actual game.
7015640	7019160	And of course, since the iPhone will allow you to do microtransactions now, you can bet
7019160	7023320	there's going to be downloadable songs in the future that you will be able to buy these
7023320	7026120	song packs from EA Mobile.
7026120	7031320	So basically, this is just Rock Band on your phone, and you can play drums with your fingers.
7031320	7034680	And in my opinion, it's a little ridiculous, because you know what?
7034680	7038360	They're going to charge kind of, you know, a high price for this.
7038360	7041440	And there's some folks in chat that disagree with me.
7041440	7042440	Tap Tap is rads.
7042440	7045320	There's a couple people there, so.
7045320	7046320	You know what?
7046320	7050920	I probably won't ever get it because I'm still playing pickle.
7050920	7051920	You know what I find?
7051920	7055000	I've bought a lot of iPhone games that I just don't play.
7055000	7058520	And maybe it goes back to that whole handheld gaming thing that I don't really care for
7058520	7059680	handheld games usually.
7059680	7061880	I don't really play them a lot.
7061880	7067120	But I find that when I'm on my iPhone and I'm bored, I'm on Safari or Wikipedia or something.
7067120	7069820	I'm never on the games, hardly ever.
7069820	7073840	Here's what I have on mine, just for games left on here right now, is Peggle Cooking
7073840	7078720	Mama Vi, which was the Sega CD RPG.
7078720	7086440	I have the IMT Pain app.
7086440	7087440	Let me tell you what I have.
7087440	7088440	Click on Word of Day.
7088440	7089440	That's fun.
7089440	7091000	I have quite a few.
7091000	7098240	DDRS, Tap Tap Revenge 2, Word Fu, Labyrinth, Wild West, Silent Hill the Escape, Aurora
7098240	7105360	Faint the Arena, Pinball Dreams, Peggle, Columns Deluxe, Infinity Gene Space Invaders, Civilization
7105360	7113160	Revolution, and Luminous Light, which if you listen to the mini show from last week, is
7113160	7115340	the most horrible adaptation of Luminous.
7115340	7117320	It's an aberration of a Luminous game.
7117320	7121840	I've also had a Light Cycle game, remember, I had my Light Cycle game for a while, and
7121840	7125520	I did get Katamari, which I just didn't think was as much fun as I'd hoped it would have
7125520	7126520	been on the iPhone.
7126520	7133480	And I had Pole Position Remix, which was pretty fun, but mostly, you know, what I've been
7133480	7134480	playing on here.
7134480	7136120	I tried Pac-Man when I didn't think it was fun.
7136120	7139080	I just think the touch controls kind of suck.
7139080	7140080	Like I'm just kind of done with it.
7140080	7141080	Except for Peggle.
7141080	7142920	Yeah, they make it work for Peggle.
7142920	7143920	I will give you that.
7143920	7147400	It's actually a lot of fun to play Peggle on the iPhone.
7147400	7148720	That would be like the first game I would ever play.
7148720	7150600	Oh yeah, I have my Solid Tear game.
7150600	7153240	I had a good Sudoku game, too.
7153240	7156840	Well, anyhow, Rock Band's coming to the iPhone, and I don't care.
7156840	7158000	But maybe you do.
7158000	7160760	I'm sure there will be plenty of folks that download this, they're not gonna have a problem
7160760	7164800	selling this, but there you go.
7164800	7170000	Anyhow, let's get into the part of the show that is all about you guys, and the emails
7170000	7174720	that you send us every week to Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
7174720	7176720	It's our Orange Lounge Radio Mailbag segment.
7176720	7178840	I know, I'm excited, too.
7178840	7183200	Dark Soccer's gonna jump in head first in the email bag, and pull out some emails to
7183200	7184200	read.
7184200	7188040	I doubt it's very full this week, as we didn't have a show last week, really.
7188040	7189240	Well, we had a pre-taped show.
7189240	7190520	We had a number.
7190520	7191720	A tiny show.
7191720	7195120	Anyway, this comes from Slapshot, I'm gonna guess.
7195120	7200800	Hey guys, I know you probably won't read this on this show because of the content, but I
7200800	7205360	have a question about trying out, quote, Sims 3.
7205360	7210240	Everything has installed fine, and I'm using Magic Disc for my ISO.
7210240	7211240	I see.
7211240	7213240	Yeah, I'm gonna go ahead and do it online, I don't care.
7213240	7217440	After Sims 3 loads up, it gives me the error saying I don't have a disc in my drive.
7217440	7218440	Any suggestions?
7218440	7221600	Thanks a lot.
7221600	7222600	I have a suggestion.
7222600	7223600	Buy the game.
7223600	7224600	Buy the game.
7224600	7225600	That'll fix it.
7225600	7229480	Having a physical disc would probably be advisable.
7229480	7235200	I don't mean to give you shit, but when you decide to pirate games, getting low quality
7235200	7239440	and crap like this happening to you is exactly what you sign up for.
7239440	7245360	So like, if this were fmylife.com, I'd be clicking you deserved it right now.
7245360	7249520	So sorry I don't have any real advice for you, but you know what, here comes a point
7249520	7254720	where we have to say, enough piracy is enough, and do it just buy the game.
7254720	7259160	I'm sorry, I was actually suddenly looking at the back of the box.
7259160	7264360	Yeah, because my Sims 3 box is like sitting here on my desk because I keep the game in
7264360	7268280	my damn drive and take it out to burn DVDs, so.
7268280	7270840	Who else has seen the back of your box?
7270840	7277880	Look, oooh, Rob, it's my box, it's green.
7277880	7280720	Look, my box has a car.
7280720	7283720	I need to see a doctor.
7283720	7284720	Next email, quick.
7284720	7286720	Give me a doctor!
7286720	7287720	No, okay.
7287720	7292320	Um, this is from our buddy Rob-ba-ba.
7292320	7296320	Although this is not podcast material, I just wanted to share about my first trip to Disneyland.
7296320	7298200	Oh, it's podcast material.
7298200	7300000	I can see why you guys love it so much.
7300000	7303280	The Nightmare Before Christmas Haunted Mansion was amazing and worth a trip alone.
7303280	7308200	I also noticed that your Pirates of the Caribbean ride has the same basic components, but it
7308200	7309200	is just plain better.
7309200	7312600	Well, that's because we have two drops on ours.
7312600	7317000	You know, the one over in Florida has one drop.
7317000	7321880	Sorry, we just had a feed drop in our stage, so I was talking to the chatters.
7321880	7322880	What is this about?
7322880	7323880	I'm sorry.
7323880	7324880	Um, it's Disneyland.
7324880	7325880	Oh, yay!
7325880	7326880	Rob-ba-ba.
7326880	7327880	That's right, he went.
7327880	7331600	He went the one week I didn't go, because I went and then I stayed here a week and then
7331600	7333560	I went again, and he was there the week I was home.
7333560	7337920	Well, going forward, I love California Adventure too, so I looked it up on Google Maps and
7337920	7342400	saw something cool in the lagoon, which still had water in the picture.
7342400	7347000	There appears to be an earthquake happening based on the interference pattern on the surface.
7347000	7351280	A normal lagoon of that size would normally have small irregular waves, not evenly spaced
7351280	7357960	in consistent wave patterns, except that they, um, the lagoon water is filtered and runs
7357960	7365200	through cyclically, so, well, it did, when they had one, so, because I've actually got
7365200	7372040	to peek in the lagoon now that it's, um, dumped out and they're redoing shit, so, but yeah.
7372040	7375920	Actually I love looking at, just look at Disneyland over on Google Maps, that's pretty cool.
7375920	7377640	It's kind of fun to go on a virtual tour of Disneyland.
7377640	7381420	I love Google Maps just to go on virtual tours of just about anything, but I'm really glad
7381420	7385800	to hear Rob-ba-ba had fun at Disneyland, because it is a fun place.
7385800	7389520	I'm hoping to go one more time before my season pass expires.
7389520	7393720	And this is, now I keep forgetting if we said it was Shook, I think you said Shook.
7393720	7394720	I think it is Shook.
7394720	7395720	Okay.
7395720	7396720	Hello, OLR.
7396720	7399720	First off, I'd like to say that my fight with my father is over.
7399720	7400720	Yay!
7400720	7403760	Wait, I thought it was resolved in a previous episode of OLR.
7403760	7404760	Alright, whatever.
7404760	7406440	His dad took the game away, remember?
7406440	7408000	Yeah, but I thought they made up.
7408000	7409000	Alright, anyway.
7409000	7412240	I talked to him quoting you guys, I hope he didn't quote the kind of rude stuff that we
7412240	7413240	said, because, anyway.
7413240	7416240	But he seemed understanding for once.
7416240	7420240	He tried playing Final Fantasy X, and he actually seemed to love it, most notably the metal
7420240	7421240	music.
7421240	7422320	Now, on to the main story.
7422320	7427440	I was in gym class playing American football when an idiot in my class fouls the ball.
7427440	7431400	He runs over to the ball and starts teabagging the ball.
7431400	7433920	Let that sink in.
7433920	7436440	I swear to God we read this email the week you weren't here.
7436440	7437440	Did you?
7437440	7440280	But I'm looking at the date that email was received, and it was Friday, I wonder if dude
7440280	7441280	sent the email twice.
7441280	7443920	Oh, well, if you already read it, then.
7443920	7444920	Go ahead and finish.
7444920	7446160	Is it about the lewd sexual behavior?
7446160	7447160	Yeah, you weren't here.
7447160	7448160	Go ahead.
7448160	7449160	You can put your opinion on it.
7449160	7451120	No, no, if you already read it, then.
7451120	7452120	I could be wrong.
7452120	7453120	I don't know.
7453120	7454920	Chatters, does this email sound familiar?
7454920	7459360	That's why I said I could swear we had a resolution on the, um, but maybe he re-sent it, because
7459360	7462280	the podcast feed hasn't gotten updated in a while, so maybe he didn't hear it.
7462280	7465620	Alright, well, the coach grabs him by the neck, drags him inside, screaming, you little
7465620	7467300	son of a bitch.
7467300	7473240	If idiot was suspended for lewd sexual behavior, it just goes to show how far gaming has taken
7473240	7474720	us in society.
7474720	7479840	Is it true- it truly is the shit like this that gives us good gamers a bad stereotyped
7479840	7481240	name.
7481240	7485400	Was it re- what really pisses me the hell off slash rant.
7485400	7486400	You're truly shook.
7486400	7491360	Uh, PS, a few weeks ago, Juan ranted about old people not wearing bras.
7491360	7492360	He was right.
7492360	7497920	A little bag of an English teacher let out a knit- a knit slip in front of everyone.
7497920	7498920	Gag.
7498920	7499920	Ew!
7499920	7503240	You've got a fucked up school, dude.
7503240	7506360	Your English teachers are showing their ta-tas and your gym teachers are throwing people
7506360	7509220	against the wall, calling them sons of bitches, like, seriously?
7509220	7510220	Go to private school?
7510220	7518140	Well, first of all, the behavior was- Tell your dad we said that, too.
7518140	7525080	The behavior of the, uh, idiot playing football was indeed unnecessary and deserved punishment,
7525080	7527320	but- Has nothing to do with games.
7527320	7529180	Yeah, that has nothing to do with games.
7529180	7536120	The coach, however, seriously, uh, needed to, uh, also be suspended at least for a game
7536120	7541760	or have, uh, you know, some sort of probationary measure taken.
7541760	7545480	And then, um, your English teacher does need to wear a better bra.
7545480	7551240	This sounds like the high school in Glee, like, only, like, random shit happens.
7551240	7554560	What- You've got an interesting life- None of that ever happened at- at mine except
7554560	7562760	for one teacher accidentally, um, ripping his, um, pants in, um, I always tell his underwear
7562760	7563760	but still.
7563760	7568660	Shook, I hope you're writing all this down so that you can write an epic autobiography
7568660	7569660	someday.
7569660	7571080	A memoir, if you will.
7571080	7574240	Dude, sell it to a reality show or something.
7574240	7576240	Of course, you know I won't watch it.
7576240	7577240	Um.
7577240	7578720	You're so kind.
7578720	7581920	I don't watch, like, a reality show, sorry, you know.
7581920	7585040	Um, okay, this next one comes from, uh, SonicM88.
7585040	7586600	Hello, O.L.R.!
7586600	7587600	Hi.
7587600	7588600	Bling, bling.
7588600	7593280	I was just responding.
7593280	7595320	I miss you guys a ton.
7595320	7598880	I haven't- Wow, a ton, that's two thousand pounds.
7598880	7603200	I haven't been able to listen to you guys for ever- several months for complicated reasons
7603200	7605960	but I needed to let you guys know something.
7605960	7609900	Rob, I remember way back in an old podcast you used to talk about how much you loved
7609900	7611960	Alanis Morissette in Rock Band 2.
7611960	7616240	Well, as I'm sure you know, two additional Alanis Morissette songs came as downloadable
7616240	7617240	content.
7617240	7618240	What?
7618240	7619240	Really?
7619240	7624200	I was probably just as stoked as you were to hear that they were coming out-
7624200	7625200	You lie!
7625200	7629880	So I bought them as soon as I could and for you I decided to get first place on both of
7629880	7631840	them, Ironic and Head Over Feet, on vocals.
7631840	7635960	Wait a minute, wait a minute, hold on, Loki, Alanis' tracks came out on Rock Band?
7635960	7637960	I miss this.
7637960	7638960	There may have been some.
7638960	7641040	You know what, we didn't cover Rock Band releases last week because we didn't have
7641040	7642040	a show.
7642040	7643040	Yeah.
7643040	7644040	Maybe it did happen.
7644040	7645040	Chatters?
7645040	7646040	Did I really miss that?
7646040	7647040	Can I continue?
7647040	7648040	Yeah.
7648040	7649040	Figure is the one week that you don't do it.
7649040	7650040	I know, right?
7650040	7658760	As of this posting I'm still first on Xbox 360 leaderboards, gamertag LucasPones8907.
7658760	7663080	He sends a follow up email though.
7663080	7666840	It seems someone's taken my first place on Head Over Feet but I'm working hard for first
7666840	7668080	again for you, Rob.
7668080	7672400	I'm still first on Ironic though but maybe I shouldn't say that or I'll jinx my score
7672400	7673400	again.
7673400	7675960	Dude, I'll play expert with you or something and we'll take over the leaderboards.
7675960	7679760	I did not know that was- now I gotta get my Xbox 360 back.
7679760	7683160	There you go, you asked earlier what it would take to get my 360 back.
7683160	7685120	What's gonna light the fire under Rob's ass?
7685120	7686320	Alanis and Rock Band, there you go.
7686320	7689680	Hey, you know what lit the fire under your ass for PS3?
7689680	7690680	Abba!
7690680	7695640	Oh yeah, SingStar Abba, yeah, that was a big seller too.
7695640	7696640	Which I still play.
7696640	7700800	You need to play some Beatles Rock Band with me.
7700800	7702680	I did pretty damn good, okay?
7702680	7705640	I blame you now for me playing Beatles Rock Band.
7705640	7706640	So there is-
7706640	7707720	Getting me up there making me sing.
7707720	7711760	There is much more to the cast of Orange Lounge Radio than just video games and I will say,
7711760	7718720	I am not ashamed to admit I'm a huge Alanis Morissette fan and that was my musical muse
7718720	7721000	in high school, like for real.
7721000	7727180	Did you actually watch the video that I posted on Facebook a while back which was the metaphor
7727180	7731160	free radio thing from College Humor?
7731160	7732640	Was that the-
7732640	7733640	The guy sitting in the car?
7733640	7734640	Turn around?
7734640	7735640	No, I didn't see that one.
7735640	7736640	No.
7736640	7738040	I saw the total eclipse of the heart little video.
7738040	7742680	It was basically a guy listening to his radio says, and now on Sublight Radio we have metaphor
7742680	7747640	free radio and then it was all these songs doing like literally what the songs mean and
7747640	7754720	the Alanis part was, I hate you Dave Coulier.
7754720	7758120	Shut the front door, Tiger Claw just linked me to rockband.com.
7758120	7762160	Sure enough, this happened on October 2nd, this would have been the week we weren't here.
7762160	7763160	This was last week.
7763160	7767920	That's just what goes to show if we miss a session.
7767920	7770800	Electric Six and Flowbots.
7770800	7773600	Oh my God, Gaybar by Electric Six is in rockband.
7773600	7774600	That song is awesome.
7774600	7775600	Sweet.
7775600	7779340	You, I want to take you to a gaybar.
7779340	7780340	That song is rad.
7780340	7782440	Dude, we missed an awesome week.
7782440	7785120	Do you have that on your computer, Rob?
7785120	7793140	I do, but iTunes will slow things down significantly, however, this is why we have such wonderful
7793140	7797000	things like YouTube so that when you're in the middle of a radio show, you can actually
7797000	7804000	just pull it up and you can actually get the song.
7804000	7830240	Why is War censored on YouTube?
7830240	7836040	Is that because it's Abraham Lincoln wearing no pants and you can't say more?
7836040	7847840	On a spin bike at that.
7847840	7851440	Tell me you do not want to play this in rockband right the fuck now.
7851440	7852440	Seriously.
7852440	7864200	After the show, YouTube that immediately, it's hilarity.
7864200	7865200	It really is.
7865200	7867880	That song is awesome.
7867880	7873200	Anyhow, thank you, emailer, for alerting us to such awesomeness in rockband that we missed
7873200	7874200	the week of...
7874200	7875200	Ironically enough...
7875200	7877480	Rob is throwing up the horns, but he's doing it wrong.
7877480	7881360	Ironically enough, the week of gay days at Disneyland.
7881360	7886520	Rob is throwing up the horns the wrong way, because really, that's too much metal for
7886520	7889240	one hand.
7889240	7890640	Too much metal at the gay bar.
7890640	7896240	All right, anyhow, let's move on to the FUs of the week, which I sadly don't really have
7896240	7899640	a story to inspire tonight.
7899640	7902120	So we're just going to get into the FUs of the week.
7902120	7906180	I thought there was something in our show about a lawsuit, but I guess maybe it was
7906180	7909200	something I cut out accidentally, whatever.
7909200	7910600	It's one of those nights tonight.
7910600	7915960	I've been drinking wine, and now I have gay bar on repeat in my head, and now Loki's singing
7915960	7917960	it over there.
7917960	7918960	I just said one line.
7918960	7919960	All right, anyhow.
7919960	7920960	Here come the FUs of the week.
7920960	7921960	A chance for a little angst in your life.
7921960	7922960	Oh, this is bad.
7922960	7923960	Here is justice.
7923960	7924960	Here is punishment.
7924960	7925960	Here...
7925960	7926960	This is fucked up.
7926960	7949320	Um, FU to EDD and other disability things for the lovely gap in my paycheck, which has
7949320	7954840	not been fun because, you know, I like to have money with which to pay my bills.
7954840	7962840	I really like being able to pay my bills because, you know, it means that I can eat and have
7962840	7967880	a place to live without, you know, feeling completely guilty for, you know, taking advantage
7967880	7974040	of my friend's generosity, and, you know, and there's also this, you know, wonderful
7974040	7978160	concept, Rob, of power and internet.
7978160	7979160	I love them.
7979160	7981160	Love them both.
7981160	7985840	I would seriously go without eating before I didn't pay the internet bill.
7985840	7990440	Honestly, I realize my priorities are fucked, but...
7990440	7991440	I'll put it this way.
7991440	7998460	I found food in my fridge that I didn't even know existed, and then once we got a little
7998460	8006720	bit of a break thanks to me getting some massage work in, thanks to having a very good generous
8006720	8012400	friend and, uh, thanks to a little bit of a break on our rent, so we actually were able
8012400	8014400	to go get groceries and get some of our bills paid.
8014400	8015920	I might take you out for a massage, by the way.
8015920	8017920	I can use one if you're still giving them out.
8017920	8018920	Fifty bucks?
8018920	8019920	I might actually go for it.
8019920	8020920	For an hour?
8020920	8021920	For an hour.
8021920	8022920	Hmm.
8022920	8023920	I might do it.
8023920	8024920	I might have friends that are interested too if you really want.
8024920	8027920	As long as they won't report me for not having my business license.
8027920	8028920	Oh.
8028920	8033320	Well, I don't know about that, but, you know, I can't do T.A. there.
8033320	8034320	No.
8034320	8035320	Rob.
8035320	8036320	Rob.
8036320	8037320	Rob.
8037320	8038320	Yeah, but I'll charge for that.
8038320	8039320	Wink.
8039320	8040320	Wink.
8040320	8041320	Okay.
8041320	8042320	Wink.
8042320	8043320	Wink.
8043320	8044320	Wink.
8044320	8045320	Wink.
8045320	8046320	Wink.
8046320	8047320	IGH.
8047320	8051320	// Humane
8051320	8052120	F.e. to the guy.
8052120	8053320	It's actually kind of my fault.
8053320	8059300	F.e. to me, answering the door to my house because every time I do, it's always somebody
8059300	8064340	is trying to sell me something and, for some reason, I end up getting roped into buying
8064340	8065340	something.
8065340	8067940	It was actually a guy coming up to quote us for a new roof
8067940	8070340	Which is fine cuz we needed that and I wanted to quote for a new roof
8070420	8073820	But he sat there and talked to us for two hours, and that was just unacceptable
8073820	8076500	I just wanted him to give me a damn price because I knew it was gonna be expensive anyways
8076780	8080540	But he sat there and talked about how his roofing system is the most
8080940	8086180	Awesome thing in the world, and I really don't give a crap because I was in the middle of soldering for my new cabinet
8087140	8089140	And you don't interrupt that
8089140	8093900	Um f you to something I didn't bring up earlier in the show
8094100	8098980	But f you to the fact that my world of warcraft account got hacked this week while I was on vacation
8098980	8103780	I got a call Monday morning for my buddy Shane who said that all my characters were logging in and out of Ravencrest
8103780	8107540	And I said boy, that's really funny because I'm not playing the game right now in fact
8107540	8111340	I'm in Los Angeles turns out my password was stolen and my account was hacked
8112140	8118820	Which makes me feel very vulnerable because if they have my wow password what else do they have now granted?
8118820	8122540	I removed an authenticator from my account which yes, you might think is stupid
8122540	8127420	But the keychain broke so I was gonna lose that authenticator if I didn't remove my account
8127420	8132100	So they could've stolen my password from my ex-boyfriend's computer, or maybe his was insecure
8132100	8132660	I don't know
8132660	8136100	But all I know is that it makes me very nervous to know that I have passwords stolen
8136100	8142580	So I had to go change all of my passwords and everything to Blizzard's credit very nice customer service even though
8142580	8147220	It took me forever to get through like they had a 30-minute hold time Monday morning
8147220	8151260	And I even called like right before close, and I still had to wait 18 minutes before I got a representative
8151260	8156460	But to be fair she was very nice did everything she was supposed to do I trained customer service for call centers
8156460	8157660	I'm always very
8157660	8162860	Scrutinizing those people she was a very good rep and I got an email from a lady that was very nice at Blizzard too
8162980	8164700	The GM's fixed my stuff
8164700	8170300	It's probably the whole thing took about three to four days, but fuck you to people who steal passwords, and I've decided
8170820	8173740	I'm completely against people buying gold and wow at this point
8173740	8180460	You know why because you only encourage these assholes to do what they do so if you buy wow and or if you buy gold and
8180460	8182460	Wow fuck you
8184620	8186220	There you go
8186220	8192040	X link in chat says wow rape damn. Yes. I feel like I was raped in the face by a
8192820	8197420	Warcraft hacker Lumi's in chat says Rob. I had to wait an hour and a half on Friday morning
8197420	8200220	I should get everything restored in two to four days well sadly
8200220	8204500	I guess it wasn't just I mean I'm glad to hear it wasn't just me, but at the same time that really sucks
8204900	8208020	Yeah, it takes a couple days to get everything restored see now the good news was I
8208580	8210020	Wasn't really playing on that server
8210020	8211380	I was playing on a different server
8211380	8216620	But right around the same time my wow account got hacked and I got home was when I was really getting into demon souls
8216620	8218900	so I wasn't really missing Wow anyway, but
8219420	8221420	It still sucks
8221740	8223380	bar
8223380	8225380	by the way
8225460	8229620	The story I was going to read to lead into the F use tonight for some reason I forgot to link it
8229620	8231620	There was a dude that got
8232100	8236380	Banned from the Sony PlayStation Network, and he was gonna file a lawsuit
8236380	8239420	Or he did file a lawsuit saying that his first amendment rights were breached
8240020	8245180	Well, and what's wrong with this picture? Can your first amendment rights really be breached when you're banned from the PlayStation Network?
8246060	8249060	No, cuz bright PlayStation Network is a private network
8249060	8252500	And that's exactly what a judge Ronald M
8252500	8259500	White said in a federal court in the Northern District of California earlier this week is that there was no plausible first of amendment cause and
8259860	8265460	Throughout the lawsuit but interesting from some of the commenters here on Kotaku where I saw this story
8265460	8270540	I thought a really good point that was brought up by one of the commenters is that but when you buy stuff on PlayStation Network
8270620	8272900	It's tied to your login name
8272900	8278660	So if you suddenly get banned from Wow, not only do you use your act lose your access you lose everything you bought
8278660	8283780	That is kind of messed up in a way. Although granted. I mean if you did something really bad
8283780	8289820	Maybe you had it coming. It's also in the terms of service and you have to read that but that is that shady
8289820	8291820	That's a little shady throw all this money
8293100	8298660	It's an incentive for him not to be a douchebag now what is kind of messed up and yeah
8298660	8305340	You may not understand you realize it like for example the PlayStation Network forums, you know where it's tied to your account
8305340	8310860	you get banned from the forums you get banned from PlayStation Network, which is kind of shady because you know
8310860	8315900	You may not realize that but once again read your terms of service Wow and don't be a douchebag
8316140	8319300	Yeah, I mean I agree with don't be a douchebag and maybe he had it coming in a way
8319300	8323100	But at the same time like what if a mistake happens because you know, like I you know
8323100	8324860	I'm comparing apples to oranges here
8324860	8326960	But on the Xbox side of things if you get banned
8326960	8329580	There's no way to contest it which I think it's kind of fucked up
8329580	8333480	Like I think there should be a way you can contest it especially if it's like not you
8333480	8338820	I mean you are responsible for your account that it added up but after getting hacked in Wow and
8339180	8344860	Seriously, I'm not an idiot on the computer. Okay, like I know what sites I'm logging into
8345220	8347740	I'm not you know, I'd like to think I'm not an idiot
8347740	8352900	so I'm kind of shocked that this happened to me and that was really alarming because I
8353640	8358740	Don't do stupid things on my computer. Like I don't download programs and run them. You know what I mean?
8358740	8365100	Like it's kind of scary. So I heard it might have been an exploit in flash that got me but still
8365940	8367580	terrible
8367580	8371540	Terrible terrible. All right, just a couple more stories for you guys and then your calls Loki
8372260	8376540	yes, so EA has trademarked a new game called the Ripper and
8377300	8381740	what it's believed to be is actually a game based on Jack the Ripper and
8382900	8384900	apparently I
8384900	8392340	I guess this is a kinder gentler Jack the Ripper and not really he's killing people friendship friendship
8392620	8399180	He's still killing people. But these people aren't really people. They're demons. So he's killing demons and
8399820	8405300	Want to say I saw a law and order or no, not law and order. This is very similar to uh, god damn it
8405300	8407300	there is a a
8407500	8409500	Movie that was out there. I
8409500	8410940	I
8410940	8416420	Can't remember it now. Anyways, this is similar to movie, you know where you're killing demons with its people and stuff like that
8416900	8421820	So yeah, think of like I guess a dead space game where you're Jack the Ripper ripping people apart
8421820	8424300	But they're really demons so you shouldn't feel so bad about it
8426220	8428220	Praise Jack the Ripper
8428780	8432220	Interesting, I guess and it's believed that this is
8433660	8436280	Visceral's games new action title
8436280	8438280	All
8439240	8441000	Right, I
8441000	8444880	Guess I'll have to wait to see this game in motion there. It could be interesting
8444880	8447200	I mean, I like the survival horror type games
8447200	8450600	Although I have yet to check out saw but I'm kind of on the fence like, you know
8450600	8451920	I'm not gonna get into it again
8451920	8454280	But you know how I feel about the saw movies and that is I hate them
8454440	8458680	But I am kind of curious about the game because the game's demo looked interesting at e3
8458680	8461360	I'm surprised you haven't played it Loki seem like type of thing. You would have got all the time
8461360	8466040	I'm playing DJ hero. Gotcha. All right. Anyhow, one more story for you guys
8466040	8468660	Then we're gonna open up the skype line at one eight seven seven game
8468800	8472780	Olr or our username on skype orange lounge radio hoping to hear from some new people tonight
8473280	8475980	Because now we have some new people listening. So one eight seven seven game
8475980	8481600	Olr username on skype is orange launch radio. We have one more story for you guys involving one of my favorite games
8481600	8486080	In fact, probably my favorite game ever on the Commodore 64 at least I can think of right now
8486080	8492000	Our con remember our con it was like battle chess but cooler because it wasn't actually chess
8492000	8495720	But it was dark versus light and you were trying to take over these power squares
8495760	8500680	but when you would when two pieces would come together like the shape-shifter and the Phoenix or the
8501080	8506280	Banshee and the Valkyrie they would do battle in this arena and you would have basically have to kill one other piece
8506360	8511240	So it wasn't like chess where whoever was the attacker was always the victor two pieces would fight
8511240	8514200	Well, the game came on the iPhone not that long ago
8514200	8517640	There was a version of it released for iPhone, which I forgot about that might be a game
8517640	8520780	I need to pick up even though I just talked about how I don't play games on iPhone, but I love our con
8521380	8528300	Well, apparently the game was so successful. Guess what our con is coming back to the PC. That's right
8528820	8535500	Information coming from Chad Lee the owner and developer of react games in bringing our con back to the PC
8535500	8538960	We've really focused on maintaining the classic feel of the original game
8539040	8542600	That said there were aspects of the title that needed updating for the modern audience
8542600	8547280	For example, the addition of four players was never in the original but it adds so much fun
8547280	8552960	It feels like it always belonged there. So yes, there are achievements and HD resolution online support
8553000	8558200	It's all gonna be there and apparently there's gonna be a new our con based iPhone game as well
8558640	8565760	It's gonna be a single-player experience with four campaigns at 60 quests unique enemies and characters
8566160	8568560	It's all gonna use ng moko's plus
8568560	8572600	technology awards and a leaderboard and all that fun stuff
8573200	8579920	our con conquest submitted to the App Store earlier this month should be out any time now and the first our con game just you
8579920	8583400	Know was a remake of the first game. So that's very exciting
8583960	8589020	Because I love our con. I'm a little iffy on this whole like four player modernized thing, but you know what?
8589020	8592760	I'll still try it out. So hopefully it's cool kind of a bummer
8592760	8596360	There's no console release, but at least hey anybody can put anything out on PC, right?
8596360	8597600	anybody
8597600	8602200	Anybody else a fan of our con just me just me. Okay. All right. I like battle chess
8602720	8609720	Yeah, I never played the game. Did you ever play battle chess to know there was battle chess to Chinese chess
8609720	8614600	And it was a totally I mean because obviously it was based off a Chinese chess totally different
8614640	8619640	But I actually did play that when I was a kid tried to learn how to play Chinese chess. It's hard. It's not
8620200	8623680	Chinese checkers Chinese chess totally different. Anyhow
8623680	8628040	One eight seven seven game. Ol our username on skype is orange lounge radio
8628040	8630120	It's that time of the show where we're gonna take your calls
8630360	8634640	So give us a call and comment on anything you've heard about tonight or any topic
8634640	8638240	We haven't discussed that you'd like us to get into before we get into that
8638840	8642060	And before the calls start rolling in since there is a little delay before the calls
8642160	8645520	Hit our line when you guys hear it Loki any last-minute stories
8647800	8650520	Yeah, the odd world games are coming to the PlayStation Network and
8650520	8653800	Apparently tells that were exclusive before
8654600	8660200	Also now coming to the PC. They have a new pack that they're basically release them under I guess the
8660960	8662960	What was it the?
8663840	8665840	Original no
8666200	8670220	The odd box that's what it was including looks like a
8672040	8674040	Stranger's wrath
8674360	8676360	Munches Odyssey and
8676360	8683200	The original odd world game so that's kind of cool. Um, that's it. Let me get to the phones. We have a call
8683200	8685200	Hi, you're on orange launch radio
8686180	8691880	Hello, you're oh my gosh Skype crashed on me that sucks that was not the caller's fault that was Skype's fault
8691880	8698560	It just crashed that's like a bad Skype naughty naughty and I apologize to the caller that was on the line waiting to talk to us
8698880	8705120	But computer crashes, I guess are inevitable. Thank God Adobe Edition didn't crash or we lose all part B of our show
8705120	8707120	Wouldn't that be lovely do over?
8708160	8710720	I'm gonna call that person back because they did get through
8711960	8713200	mm-hmm
8713200	8716160	This is a nice thing when you call through Skype. I know who it is. Hi
8717560	8721200	You're on orange on this radio. Who's this? Hey, this is excellent. Hi X link
8721200	8724880	I don't know if you heard if the buffer made it through for some reason Skype crashed. So we called you back
8726240	8729560	Appreciate no, I was on there and I saw that I was like wow, that's kind of interesting
8729560	8732960	I thought was my end because I'm having problems with my laptop right now with my
8732960	8737900	Um mouse pad part with the click instead of clicking once you like to like like five different times
8738520	8742360	Just sucks. Although I am thinking about using it on my PSP. I have a PSP headset
8742360	8744360	I can use Skype on it, but I'm like who would call me
8744800	8746040	like
8746040	8750960	Nobody calls my iPhone. Why would people call me on Skype? I don't know. Anyway, sorry, that would be kind of interesting
8751800	8754640	Few things I'm gonna make this make this quick course
8754640	8760200	I'm gonna go through a few things here really quickly the PSP mini prices are actually pretty
8760200	8765320	Decent the only one that's really the highest point as of right now would be the Tetris game
8767040	8768500	Sudoku is
8768500	8774560	$6.99 and there's a two other ones for $4.99 and I believe two or three other ones for $6.99
8774560	8776560	So, I mean they're all under ten bucks
8777400	8783880	Level in Sudoku though is zero. I mean I'm done with Sudoku you Sudoku can be played with paper in pen, but yeah
8783880	8785880	I totally agree. I guess
8785880	8791160	It's just EA though and you know EA is gonna be a little more expensive because you know the EA brand name being on it
8791160	8793160	So, oh well hell of course
8794840	8798360	As for the Kingdom Hearts I played a new one I've been playing a new one for DS
8798360	8803120	I'm not gonna give anything away storyline wise but I'm gonna say I know you're a big fan of it
8803120	8806060	Play it when you get a chance or you know buy it. It's
8806760	8813360	Worth wild. It's been a lot of fun. I've been playing about ten hours and I've been pretty much addicted to it. So
8813360	8816120	And there is a lot of different characters in it
8816120	8819120	Okay, as long as they didn't cut out the Disney then I'm happy. How about Tron?
8819120	8823840	You can spoil that for me is Tron in it. I believe I don't know be it quite honest
8823840	8827920	I only played ten hours. I'm not really in I'm only on the second third world
8827920	8833200	I was gonna say it was ten hours enough to get past the prologue like Kingdom Hearts 2. Oh, definitely
8833200	8837240	You know, there's a lot of talk in the beginning and there's a lot of the beginning where they're saying
8837240	8841160	Okay, this button is this this does this if you press this button it does this
8841160	8847540	This is how you do stuff in the game. But once you get past all of it, it pretty much becomes normal. Hmm
8847800	8850000	All right. Well, I'll have to check that out
8850000	8856280	I suppose house look is it does it play like the PlayStation Kingdom Heart games or is it that it plays like that PS?
8856280	8861880	Yes, the ps1 the Kingdom Hearts and Kingdom Hearts 2 it doesn't play like that good. It's not like the chain of memory
8861880	8863880	Thank God good
8864120	8866120	So I'm waiting for birth by sleep
8866120	8872260	For the PSP now, so hopefully that will work well as well too. So well the way it's the on that one
8872840	8877480	Very cool. I'll tell you if you want a headache try playing a chain of memories on a micro
8878680	8886040	Thank you. No, thank you pass on that one. I did I do have the original though for the Gameboy advance
8886760	8892640	But yeah, no, I I tried playing that was the last one I tried to play on any handheld. I
8892640	8898120	I can only imagine what a headache machine that was anything else in your mind tonight excellent
8898120	8899200	Well, it was kind of funny
8899200	8903760	You robbed the whole hacking issue wasn't they having a problem with the Xbox Live and the hacking on that one, too?
8903760	8908840	People are trying to get some people were trying it to people's accounts to that one that had high game scores
8908840	8912320	Yeah, it was it was retarded stuff. It was like some kid
8913080	8918200	Sending voice messages to people saying I can give you cheats or whatever if you send me your account information
8918200	8922760	So like, you know, it you'd have to be an idiot to fall for that. Yeah, I
8924080	8930120	Live at least that I know of yet. I mean, I've been out of Xbox Live for about two months now, so
8931880	8935480	I've been on longer than that. So I've been busy doing my school stuff
8935480	8940560	So I can yeah, you can understand that but they're trying to probably sound like someone they were pulling back in the you know
8940560	8946400	Hey days of hey, give me I'm so I'm surprised or not. I'm so-and-so from Xbox Live. I need your name and password
8946400	8948680	There's been a system server crash that type of deal
8949240	8953640	Well, I hope everyone knows by now. Nobody will ask you for your name and password online a
8954280	8961200	Nobody that just doesn't happen not through email not online. It doesn't happen. Even when you call support they don't ask for it
8961200	8963620	They have ways of verifying you in other ways. So
8964320	8969520	Like I know with Blizzard, I guess I filled out a security question about like for example
8969920	8971620	This wasn't my security question
8971620	8974320	But like an example would be what was your house number as a child?
8974320	8977020	You know things that only you would know that a hacker wouldn't know
8977480	8983220	Yeah, so well anything else in your mind tonight? Excellent. Yeah, that's pretty much about it. All right, even so
8983220	8987000	I heard that's one the hardest ones yet from Atlas and I'm hearing they're getting good reviews from it
8987000	8988120	So you have a lot of fun with that
8988120	8989200	I just you know
8989200	8993680	Although I can see from a critical standpoint where it's getting good reviews and I'm not knocking the game at all
8993680	9000000	But the difficulty is really gonna turn some people off. So proceed carefully. Oh, I agree, but hey Atlas
9000600	9002200	RPGs you can't really beat that
9002200	9007080	I mean the every pretty much everything they have sealed with their name on there has been pretty much gold
9007080	9011940	So, all right fair enough. They do make good stuff. All right, take care. Excellent. Yeah YouTube. Thanks for the call
9012720	9015760	We got comments in chat here. What is this?
9017040	9023320	Kill Gannon one three three seven says I wonder if Rob's Wow pass was secure like caps numbers and shit
9023320	9027040	Um, I didn't use caps, but my password
9027040	9033320	To somebody who wouldn't know better would look like an a random jumble of letters
9033320	9037860	They meant something to me, but for most people just look like a random jumble of letters and numbers
9037860	9041220	I did use both letters and numbers so I don't think by any means it was easy to guess
9041520	9044400	Like it wasn't like a pet name. It wasn't
9045400	9050580	You know anything like that. So let's go to another call. Hi. You're on orange launch radio. Who's this?

9114180	9121900	We released from I think was last week. Yeah, and now also at the same time. I also want to put some moment about
9122700	9124700	PlayStation 3 as well

9127860	9134380	On the PSN store. It's a PS1 classic. Yeah, I think you guys me and like it was
9135100	9141780	Pandemonium which was poured out by I think crystal dynamics. Yes. I I've never played the game, but I
9141780	9146060	I've heard I actually have the Japanese version of it, which was
9147740	9149740	Magical hoppers. Oh
9150540	9153260	Yeah, I used to hit the desk version
9153860	9158820	Fortunately, I had that stolen a couple years ago. So I just bought the download version
9159700	9166100	And it's pretty good. The graphics are kind of dated by today's standards, but all in all it's pretty good
9166100	9172380	You know, I mean as far as my complaint isn't so much with the system itself
9172380	9177940	It's just fun, but it doesn't yeah too pretty of some of the other users on it
9178660	9185780	You know how well with the messaging on there, you know, they get the whole cut-and-paste kind of deal on there
9186420	9189940	Well, I yeah, well, I don't know if you've seen this yet or not
9189940	9192460	You know, if not, you probably will see it soon
9192460	9198720	But you know people have been doing it on piece checking messages. No, no
9200020	9202980	Oh, yeah, it's like, you know
9203260	9210140	if if you you're send this message to X number people so he's gonna see this and
9210940	9217260	And they're gonna track this message and you know, they'll really key low on the PlayStation 3
9217260	9222580	My god that ridiculous I'm like, you know, really that's why I'm thinking a
9223380	9225820	You know, he low and gears and all they are
9226500	9231540	Microsoft exclusive now, they're gonna notice nopes calm just for PlayStation Network
9231540	9236140	It sounds like they're just gonna need something to try to diffuse all the rumors there, you know
9236140	9238740	I'm surprised and I hope I'm not starting something here
9238740	9243060	I'm surprised I don't get that crap on my iPhone ever since they did the copy paste thing on iPhone, too
9243060	9249980	But I suppose whenever you open this up to you know, having the copy paste you wouldn't even really need it
9249980	9253420	I suppose it just makes it a lot easier to send these chain messages and crap
9253420	9260420	But just you know think before you forward good rule of thumb for everybody out there think before you forward
9260500	9264900	Do you really think Sony cares about what you're writing in messages to other people?
9265060	9271060	No, they don't they only put this stuff in the front end for you know as another feature
9271060	9276180	But they don't read your messages you're sending to other people and they don't track messages. That's a bunch of crap
9277380	9283420	Yes. Yeah, that's why I've been saying to all the people that have been sending me to these, you know
9283420	9287460	Yeah, I just tell them that by sending these messages
9287460	9292820	You're annoying crap out of other people and you're just showing how ignorant you are
9292820	9298020	I mean, you know using their prior example, I gave you know
9298020	9301300	You know, Microsoft's exclusives aren't going to read me
9301300	9305540	Microsoft's exclusives, you know, the pizza will fly out to someone's
9305540	9312900	Nellie reasons before those exclusives will show up on you know, PSG and vice versa
9312900	9318420	Exactly, that kind of stuff is just ridiculous that the exclusives would make their way to Sony
9318420	9320420	I mean people ought to know better
9320420	9323060	Did you have any other topics for us tonight Spaznier?
9323060	9328180	No, no, no, pretty much covers it
9328180	9329860	I'll probably let you go
9329860	9334020	I would imagine you probably want to squeeze in one more call and maybe close off afterwards
9334020	9338900	All right. Well, thank you as always Spaznier and keep on rocking the PlayStation
9338900	9339780	All right, have a good one
9339780	9340580	Take care
9340580	9343220	You know, actually I did buy a PS original not that long ago
9343220	9348100	I bought Unjamma Lamy on the PlayStation Network because you know, it's funny
9348100	9349860	I actually already own the disc for that
9349860	9354420	But I bought Unjamma Lamy just so I could have it on my PSP
9355700	9356900	So, hi, you're on Orange
9356900	9358180	I bought Parappa
9358180	9358820	Hi, you're on Orange
9358820	9359460	All right
9359460	9360100	Who's this?
9360100	9361140	Legend of Zaku
9361140	9362420	Hopefully now
9362420	9364020	Yes, we can hear you loud and clear
9364020	9365380	What's up Legend of Zaku?
9366260	9370900	Nothing much, just trying to kill just trying to kill another dull weekend and
9371540	9373300	aside from the Yanks winning
9373300	9380900	But yeah, I mean from basically what I've been seeing so far of PSP
9380900	9382900	Go has been getting a lot of flack
9382900	9384340	Most of it's actually deserving
9384980	9387460	Just for the fact that Sony is just done
9388260	9394340	They just haven't made it easy for existing PSP owners to give them the incentive to switch on
9395140	9397540	Especially when transferring existing UMDs
9398100	9402020	Did you see that story earlier this week where Reggie Fils-Aime has even come out and said
9402020	9403940	I don't get the PSP Go basically
9405300	9409060	Actually, I think he's right for the fact that for the most part
9409060	9413460	Every upgrade to the DS allowed people to play their old existing games
9414100	9420020	So in that sense, Sony's basically going two steps forward, one step back
9421540	9422980	Actually, no wait, what am I saying?
9422980	9424900	Two steps backward, one step forward
9424900	9426260	I like this, it's all right
9426260	9429860	I like this what Toa Gak says in our chat and I probably horribly mispronounced that name
9429860	9430660	I apologize
9430660	9434020	But Toa Gak says PSP Go equals PSP No
9434900	9437140	Exactly, I mean I have my original PS
9437140	9440260	I mean I have my slim PSP and I love it
9440260	9443940	You know, I love that thing to death just because I can play UMDs on it
9443940	9448260	So any new game that's still coming out, at least I have a hard copy of it
9448260	9450900	That's like something you'd see on a protest sign at a march or something
9452740	9456900	But I guess Sony really dropped the ball for this time around
9456900	9459620	They can put all the memory they want on a single unit
9459620	9465140	It's not going to change the fact that if you have your UMDs
9465140	9466900	They're practically obsolete at this point
9468900	9470020	You know, for new hardware
9470820	9476820	So it doesn't give people that incentive to just impulsively buy that new system
9478260	9479940	I want to read this comment in chat here real quick
9479940	9484100	Kutsune in chat says the PSP Go is only for those who don't already have a PSP
9484100	9488260	And I understand that point and I almost would agree with it
9488260	9493860	Almost, except I feel like with the PSP Go you get less choice than you have with the PSP 3000
9493860	9495540	Right, I mean you can't even sell
9496180	9500020	Everything's digital, there's no second-hand sales of games
9500020	9505300	Like you would with the UMD taking it to GameStop for money
9505300	9511380	If there was a faster processor, a second analog, something else in here
9511380	9516420	PS2 capability of games, something else in here I could recommend
9516420	9517620	I would be all about that
9517620	9524580	Right, if it was a brand new PSP, a new version of it
9524580	9529540	A completely new version outside of the fact that there's already been three so far
9531060	9533380	I mean that would be more than enough
9533380	9539460	But if it's more of the same with just like superficial tacked on features like Bluetooth
9539460	9543220	Which should have been in recent PSP iterations already
9543220	9547700	It just feels like Sony's like, you know, they're fucking up
9547700	9550820	You know, you're preaching to the choir here and it's tough
9550820	9555220	Because we want to give Sony credit for the things they're doing right on the PlayStation 3
9555220	9557300	But then you can't turn the blind eye on the Go
9557300	9562980	But the PSP, they're just acting like a bunch of chickens with their heads cut off
9562980	9567220	Because they don't even know how to make a product that not only new people would want
9567220	9569060	But the existing base
9570100	9572900	If you can't woo them, then that thing is dead in the water
9572900	9574340	Yeah, I agree
9574340	9575780	Well, what else is on your mind tonight, Zaku?
9577300	9578020	Nothing much
9578020	9584980	I mean except for the fact that, well, a few weeks ago I did attend an old-timers DDR tournament
9584980	9587700	Out on the break even though I didn't compete
9587700	9592580	It was basically a 32-man fifth mix tournament that took hours to complete
9593620	9597300	So that was the other highlight of these past few weeks
9598740	9600340	Eight on the break's a good arcade
9600340	9604100	I've been there, of course, and I haven't been there in a few years
9604100	9606980	Well, they put fifth mix already
9606980	9608260	They've been having that for months
9608260	9612260	And during Kings of the Coast, their big tournament in August
9612260	9614100	They were running a fourth mix plus tournament
9614100	9616820	So yeah, they're really throwing it back right over there
9616820	9619140	My love for eight on the break isn't just with the music games
9619140	9622500	But the fact that I didn't feel like that place was overrun with redemption games
9622500	9623460	It was a real arcade
9623460	9624740	Not only that, it's like cheap food
9624740	9626820	Four dollars will pretty much fill your stomach
9628420	9628900	Good point
9628900	9631300	Although it is, I wouldn't want to live on that food if you know what I mean
9632260	9632500	All right
9632500	9632980	I mean that
9633620	9636100	Zach, we're going to let you go to try and maybe squeeze in one more call
9636100	9637060	But thank you so much for the call
9637060	9638020	Okay, buddy
9638020	9638740	All right, have a good one
9638740	9639380	Go Yankees!
9640100	9640340	Yes
9640980	9643460	I always say that because my coworker loves the, I don't follow baseball
9643460	9644980	My coworker loves the Yankees
9644980	9648580	So I know that if the Yankees win, it's going to be a good day at work tomorrow
9648580	9650020	Because people will be happy
9650020	9652980	So actually I think that's going to do it for the Skype line tonight
9652980	9654500	So sorry to those that didn't get through
9654500	9657940	But you can always send us an email to mailbag at orangelauntrader.com
9657940	9659700	But for now, we want to go ahead and wrap up the show
9659700	9662980	And before we do that, we got to get everybody's final thoughts
9662980	9665300	Actually, I'm sorry, last minute stories if we have any left
9665300	9666900	I don't know if, Loki, you had anything else left
9668180	9669140	Well, let's see
9670100	9671380	I guess I could talk about
9672100	9674500	Well, they had a, you know, speaking of the PSP Go
9674500	9679540	There was a knockoff PSP Go-ish type device that was coming out
9680260	9682500	The PXP MP5
9683140	9685700	And I had to laugh though because some of the specs on it
9685700	9689140	Like it had a built-in camera, it could play emulation games and stuff like that
9689140	9691700	I'm like, wow, that's already better than the PSP Go
9692660	9696820	But yeah, I would imagine the camera is pretty low quality and all that stuff
9696820	9698100	It is a lot cheaper though
9698100	9702740	But it'll be interesting to see how much it actually sells
9702740	9704260	And I don't even know if we'll be able to tell that
9704260	9707300	Because it's going to be the PlayStation Portable Platform
9707300	9709060	And not necessarily the PSP Go
9709060	9713380	But yeah, I bet you it's going to just slump off to nothing by the time a holiday comes around
9713380	9716580	Are you able to figure out the real sales figures for PSP Go?
9716580	9718660	I don't know, they could do it with the DSI and the DS
9718660	9721620	So I wouldn't see why they wouldn't be able to at the PSP Go
9721620	9726260	But I know we're not selling a lot of them, that's for sure
9726260	9727540	A lot of people are backing out on them
9727540	9731300	We get a few people ordering like one in their store just to have it
9731300	9734260	But I don't think it's really
9734260	9735060	They never call back
9735620	9737300	No, no, they get it
9737300	9740740	And you know, they may reorder one here and there because people are looking for them
9740740	9742420	But they're not like pushing them, I guess
9742420	9745060	I see, all right
9745060	9747220	Well, that's it for last minute stories then
9747220	9749220	Let's go around and get everybody's final thought
9749220	9753700	Dark Sakura, thank you as always for your lovely contributions to the show
9753700	9756100	The Female Perspective, you're on Orange Lounge Radio
9756740	9757700	When I can't provide it
9758260	9759540	Dark Sakura, your final thought?
9760740	9764020	I want frozen yogurt, but I'm not going to have any
9764900	9767300	Sorry to hear that because frozen yogurt is amazing
9767300	9767780	Fro-Yo
9768340	9768980	We should go
9769780	9772100	We should, but I don't think the show will be over in time
9772100	9773540	This isn't that place close at 10?
9773540	9773780	Yeah
9773780	9774660	Yeah, we have Afterbirth
9774660	9776420	So I think we have three new songs tonight, right?
9777140	9777380	Yeah
9777380	9777780	We do
9778740	9779780	Did you win last?
9779780	9780340	I don't remember
9780340	9782580	You won't win anything because my song was all fucked up
9782580	9783700	I won't talk about during Afterbirth
9784260	9786660	Loki, your final thought tonight?
9786660	9792420	I need to move the cabinet into the house and then the next project is to rebuild the DVR pads
9792420	9794420	Already have them designed and everything
9794420	9795380	They're gonna be awesome
9797060	9800100	My final thought for the day is happy national coming out day
9800100	9802420	And equality for all means just that
9802420	9804260	Equal rights for all
9804260	9805860	Equal, equal, equal
9805860	9811060	There is no such thing as a domestic partnership being equal rights in any way shape or form
9811060	9813940	I had one of my friends actually, it was funny that you mentioned that
9813940	9816900	Last weekend he came up and stuff, he came out to me
9816900	9818660	He's been apparently married
9819300	9820820	He got married during that time too
9821620	9822900	That it was legal
9822900	9823380	And so
9824020	9826100	Oh, it's part of the 18,000
9826100	9826340	Yeah
9826340	9829380	Oh, I thought you meant this was like a married man to a woman who came out too
9829380	9830500	Because that could be very difficult
9830500	9832180	I've met men who have gone through
9832180	9832820	No, no, no, no
9832820	9833140	Okay
9833140	9834820	No, no idea whatsoever
9834820	9837300	But he's had a boyfriend for like, you know, ever since
9837300	9841780	Even like during like when he came to our wedding stuff
9841780	9842660	You've actually met him
9843540	9846340	But, you know, I was like, why didn't you bring him?
9846340	9848020	I'm like, that would have been okay
9848020	9850260	But he's just, he's not coming out there but yet
9850260	9852820	I met a lot of people at your wedding so I probably wouldn't remember him
9852820	9854580	But props
9854580	9854820	I
9854820	9858980	Because California is the only state where like some marriages are legal
9858980	9860980	And they don't know how to explain how it works
9860980	9862420	Let me give you a hint California
9862420	9863540	Here's how to get it right
9863540	9866100	Equal, equal, equal
9866100	9866820	Across the board
9866820	9868020	That's how you do it
9868020	9869940	There's no reason for it
9870820	9874340	No religious text should ever take away equality
9874340	9874660	Ever
9875380	9875940	So
9875940	9876420	Anyhow
9876980	9877300	That's it
9877300	9878420	I'll get off my soapbox now
9878980	9879620	That's gonna do it
9879620	9880980	For another episode of Orange on its Radio
9880980	9882260	Thank you guys so much for tuning into us
9882260	9883620	We had a really good listener count tonight
9883620	9885700	Especially considering we've been off for a week
9885700	9886900	So that must mean you missed us
9886900	9887780	So thank you very much
9887780	9890820	And you don't hate us too much for falling behind on the podcast feed and all that stuff
9890820	9892340	Hey I bet their aim's improving
9892340	9893140	I bet so too
9893140	9895300	But we'll be back next week to do it all again
9895300	9897220	I don't know if we have anything special planned for next week
9897220	9900260	Unfortunately we're not doing the big gaming marathon next week
9900260	9903700	But if you aren't already tuning into it somewhere
9903700	9906420	Please be sure you're watching the Extra Life marathon somewhere

9914100	9916340	That is going to happen around the internet on Saturday

9918020	9919940	I'm sure there'll be other ones later on
9919940	9923220	Oh yeah we'll participate in something later on
9923220	9925620	For sure a good cause somewhere
9925620	9926660	But that's going to do it for now

9928100	9930500	We'll see you next week on Orange Lounge Radio
9930500	9934740	If you've enjoyed the show all we ask you just tell a couple people about the show
9934740	9936260	Help spread by word of mouth
9936260	9939060	Because remember that's all we've got to promote Orange Lounge Radio
9939060	9944180	We don't have any fancy magazines or big million hits a month website to back us up
9944180	9946980	We only have you guys to help spread the word
9946980	9948740	So that's it have a great week
9948740	9975540	We'll see you next time here on Orange Lounge Radio
9978740	9980660	But we're probably right anyway
