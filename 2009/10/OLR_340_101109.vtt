Orange Lounge Radio

00:07.000 --> 00:12.000
With your hosts, DarkSakura, Sky and Loco

00:14.000 --> 00:19.000
Tonight, October 11th, 2009, Epic Mickey is confirmed this week as a real game.

00:19.000 --> 00:23.000
Could you soon see the Wii Balance Board used in airport security?

00:23.000 --> 00:27.000
And the Commodore 64 Classic is set for a new revival.

00:27.000 --> 00:30.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:31.000 --> 00:37.000
Hello everybody out there on the internet, on their iPods, on allgames.com or however you're listening to our show.

00:37.000 --> 00:40.000
Welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

00:40.000 --> 00:46.000
We are that show dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture and the gamer lifestyle.

00:46.000 --> 00:49.000
We like to think of ourselves as the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:49.000 --> 00:52.000
With you here every week is myself, Rob Roberts.

00:52.000 --> 00:56.000
And joining me as always, say hello to the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.

00:56.000 --> 00:57.000
You.

00:57.000 --> 00:58.000
How are you doing, DarkSakura?

00:58.000 --> 00:59.000
I'm doing.

00:59.000 --> 01:00.000
Good, good to hear.

01:00.000 --> 01:02.000
Yeah, and guess what?

01:02.000 --> 01:03.000
What?

01:03.000 --> 01:04.000
I don't have to work tomorrow.

01:04.000 --> 01:05.000
Lucky you.

01:05.000 --> 01:07.000
Who celebrates Columbus Day anymore?

01:07.000 --> 01:08.000
Banks, apparently.

01:08.000 --> 01:09.000
Colombians.

01:09.000 --> 01:13.000
Alright, anyway, also joining us, say hello to TechMaster, Loki.

01:13.000 --> 01:14.000
Hello.

01:14.000 --> 01:15.000
How you doing, Loki?

01:15.000 --> 01:16.000
I'm doing good.

01:16.000 --> 01:17.000
Awesome.

01:17.000 --> 01:19.000
How was your couple weeks off?

01:19.000 --> 01:22.000
Because you missed the show, the mini show we did.

01:22.000 --> 01:24.000
We talked about that before.

01:24.000 --> 01:26.000
That I guess you just kind of spaced it on Tuesday.

01:26.000 --> 01:27.000
I forgot.

01:27.000 --> 01:28.000
Yeah, right.

01:28.000 --> 01:30.000
I had crap going on on Tuesday, so I forgot all about it.

01:30.000 --> 01:33.000
So we pre-recorded so that, you know, because it's been weird.

01:33.000 --> 01:36.000
We've missed a couple weeks, and that's all my fault, I apologize.

01:36.000 --> 01:41.000
But we pre-recorded a show for last week, and Loki, you just kind of didn't come.

01:41.000 --> 01:42.000
Yeah, I spaced.

01:42.000 --> 01:44.000
You were better than that show.

01:44.000 --> 01:45.000
Sorry.

01:45.000 --> 01:49.000
What did you get done last Saturday, or last Sunday in Absence of Orange on radio?

01:49.000 --> 01:51.000
I put in sprinklers.

01:51.000 --> 01:52.000
Yeah?

01:52.000 --> 01:53.000
Yeah, that was not fun.

01:53.000 --> 01:54.000
But it's done?

01:54.000 --> 01:55.000
Do they work?

01:55.000 --> 01:56.000
Yeah, it's done.

01:56.000 --> 01:57.000
They work.

01:57.000 --> 01:58.000
Good, because our sprinklers need fixing.

01:58.000 --> 02:01.000
I just have to bury them, which I haven't...

02:01.000 --> 02:03.000
I finished most of it.

02:03.000 --> 02:07.000
There's a part by the valves at the bury and the side yard at the bury.

02:07.000 --> 02:08.000
Gotcha.

02:08.000 --> 02:09.000
But I haven't really...

02:09.000 --> 02:10.000
I don't know.

02:10.000 --> 02:11.000
I need...

02:11.000 --> 02:14.000
Because, you know, when you're digging that stuff out, especially if you dig it out onto

02:14.000 --> 02:19.000
grass and stuff like that, you end up losing some of the dirt because you just can't scrape

02:19.000 --> 02:21.000
all of it out of the grass.

02:21.000 --> 02:25.000
So there's like big divots where all the pipes are.

02:25.000 --> 02:29.000
And at the same time, we also chop through the cable line, which is fun.

02:29.000 --> 02:31.000
So we had to fix that too.

02:31.000 --> 02:33.000
But, yeah, they went in.

02:33.000 --> 02:34.000
They work.

02:34.000 --> 02:38.000
I ran them today trying to flush out the water because now our water out of our fridge tastes

02:38.000 --> 02:39.000
like crap.

02:39.000 --> 02:41.000
Well, you know, city water.

02:41.000 --> 02:43.000
That's what it tastes like.

02:43.000 --> 02:48.000
So, you know, we need to flush out the water out of the pipes and stuff and get it all

02:48.000 --> 02:51.000
clean, and then everything will be fine.

02:51.000 --> 02:52.000
All right.

02:52.000 --> 02:53.000
Well, it's really good to be back.

02:53.000 --> 02:56.000
Let me just tell you guys because honestly, and I was commenting to Dark Sakura before

02:56.000 --> 02:59.000
we started tonight's show, it feels like we've been gone for like a year.

02:59.000 --> 03:03.000
I don't know what it is about having missed a couple of shows here and there, but I just

03:03.000 --> 03:07.000
want to reassure everybody, we are set to go through the rest of 2009.

03:07.000 --> 03:09.000
No foreseeable vacations.

03:09.000 --> 03:12.000
I mean, of course, you know, things are going to happen, who knows what.

03:12.000 --> 03:14.000
But no foreseeable vacations for the rest of the year.

03:14.000 --> 03:16.000
We're here with you guys.

03:16.000 --> 03:21.000
And podcast feed should be all good again soon, very soon.

03:21.000 --> 03:26.000
We've got the episode from a few weeks ago up and getting that all caught up, so we'll

03:26.000 --> 03:28.000
be good to go very soon.

03:28.000 --> 03:29.000
So let's get back into it.

03:29.000 --> 03:32.000
How was your gaming week is how we always start off the show.

03:32.000 --> 03:34.000
Dark Sakura, how was your gaming week?

03:34.000 --> 03:35.000
Not very.

03:35.000 --> 03:36.000
Yeah, really?

03:36.000 --> 03:41.000
Well, I sat around watching Dan play through Shadow Complex, which is pretty cool.

03:41.000 --> 03:48.000
And I don't know, I didn't play too much myself, except I didn't even play any Sims.

03:48.000 --> 03:50.000
I was just, meh.

03:50.000 --> 03:51.000
But wait a minute.

03:51.000 --> 03:54.000
I played Peggle.

03:54.000 --> 03:55.000
Well, hold on a minute.

03:55.000 --> 03:56.000
Rewind a minute.

03:56.000 --> 03:59.000
Because you were telling me before the show started tonight, and I even noticed the background

03:59.000 --> 04:00.000
on your computer.

04:00.000 --> 04:01.000
It's a game I want.

04:01.000 --> 04:02.000
I didn't play it.

04:02.000 --> 04:04.000
Oh, I thought it was something you were watching Dan play.

04:04.000 --> 04:08.000
No, we were watching a comparison for Bayonetta.

04:08.000 --> 04:13.000
We were watching an Xbox 360 and PS3 side-by-side comparison.

04:13.000 --> 04:16.000
PS3 version looks like shit.

04:16.000 --> 04:19.000
Yeah, they're really distancing themselves from it.

04:19.000 --> 04:20.000
It's awful.

04:20.000 --> 04:21.000
Oh, the bunnies are out.

04:21.000 --> 04:22.000
Interesting.

04:22.000 --> 04:23.000
Rob, look out the window.

04:23.000 --> 04:25.000
Yeah, I saw them last week.

04:25.000 --> 04:26.000
Bunnies?

04:26.000 --> 04:27.000
In the neighbor's yard.

04:27.000 --> 04:28.000
Wow.

04:28.000 --> 04:29.000
Sorry.

04:29.000 --> 04:31.000
I heard a rooster earlier, and now bunnies.

04:31.000 --> 04:33.000
Are we out on a farm today or something?

04:33.000 --> 04:37.000
Well, our neighbors across the street, they let their bunnies run wild all over the neighborhood.

04:37.000 --> 04:39.000
And they usually like to hang out in my yard.

04:39.000 --> 04:42.000
So, we have stray bunnies.

04:42.000 --> 04:43.000
Gotcha.

04:43.000 --> 04:44.000
And not stray dogs or cats.

04:44.000 --> 04:45.000
We have stray bunnies.

04:45.000 --> 04:48.000
You been watching Dan play more ODST?

04:48.000 --> 04:51.000
That game makes me motion sick, and I don't really care for it.

04:51.000 --> 04:52.000
Gotcha.

04:52.000 --> 04:55.000
I'm like, ugh, turn off this loud piece of crap.

04:55.000 --> 05:00.000
But Dan loves it, so if he's having fun with it, then he can have fun, just not when I'm

05:00.000 --> 05:01.000
trying to go to bed.

05:01.000 --> 05:04.000
And just for folks who are newer to the show who may not know, you've never been a fan

05:04.000 --> 05:07.000
of first-person shooters, because they just make you ill.

05:07.000 --> 05:10.000
Well, I'd like them before they used 3D.

05:10.000 --> 05:12.000
When they were sprite-based, great.

05:12.000 --> 05:14.000
Like Wolfenstein was fine, right?

05:14.000 --> 05:17.000
Yeah, and Doom.

05:17.000 --> 05:18.000
Alright.

05:18.000 --> 05:19.000
Well, let's move on.

05:19.000 --> 05:20.000
Loki, how was your gaming week?

05:20.000 --> 05:23.000
My gaming week was pretty good, I guess.

05:23.000 --> 05:29.000
I played more Grand Theft Auto, Lost and Damned, where I'm up to almost rank 5.

05:29.000 --> 05:35.000
I would have been ranked 5 on Friday, but I dropped out of one of my games.

05:35.000 --> 05:41.000
And I had to go on some manager special event thing or something, so I went to a zoo instead.

05:41.000 --> 05:48.000
But no, I'm like $500 away from rank 5, which means I get more heads, as my coworker likes

05:48.000 --> 05:49.000
to put it.

05:49.000 --> 05:54.000
And it's just killing time for a couple more weeks until Ballad of Gay Tony comes out,

05:54.000 --> 05:56.000
and that'll be awesome.

05:56.000 --> 06:00.000
And then, what was it, my sister's 360 died, so now...

06:00.000 --> 06:06.000
And it's funny, hers died the same way as my last one did, where it basically lost its

06:06.000 --> 06:12.000
graphics processor, got like a green tint to it, and then the whole thing, just no video

06:12.000 --> 06:14.000
anymore, so that kind of sucked.

06:14.000 --> 06:18.000
There's no real way to fix that, and obviously it's not under warranty since hers is modded

06:18.000 --> 06:20.000
as well, so that doesn't work.

06:20.000 --> 06:24.000
But we have a way to remedy that soon enough.

06:24.000 --> 06:34.000
And then I played some DJ Hero, I have a demo unit that I got, and I've been playing the

06:34.000 --> 06:39.000
four songs that are on there, well three technically in the set, and then there's a fourth one

06:39.000 --> 06:47.000
which is like a DJ versus guitar song in there, which I didn't really play that much of because

06:47.000 --> 06:49.000
not a lot of people wanted to play guitar.

06:49.000 --> 06:57.000
And then, been having a lot of fun with that, you know, the controller's pretty nice, although

06:57.000 --> 07:02.000
since it is a demo unit, it's wired and wireless, which is fine, I don't really give a crap,

07:02.000 --> 07:05.000
because I hate replacing batteries anyways.

07:05.000 --> 07:09.000
And the only thing that sucks about those, you can't flip it because the way the cord

07:09.000 --> 07:15.000
comes out, it actually would be in the way if you flipped it to the left-handed, I guess

07:15.000 --> 07:20.000
lefty side, although for me, I don't really care because I'm right-handed, but my coworker

07:20.000 --> 07:25.000
wasn't, and he wanted to really try it, and I'm like, dude, sorry, can't, so he had to

07:25.000 --> 07:26.000
play cross-handed.

07:26.000 --> 07:30.000
Tell us a little bit, because you know, obviously Orange Highlands Radio started as a music

07:30.000 --> 07:35.000
game thing, and on our very first episode of Orange Highlands Radio, we had people in

07:35.000 --> 07:40.000
house playing BeatMania 2DX, so it's very interesting now coming here seven and a half

07:40.000 --> 07:43.000
years later, now we're going to have people in the studio playing DJ Hero tonight.

07:43.000 --> 07:50.000
How do the two games compare, if at all, what are Bomani fans going to think of DJ Hero?

07:50.000 --> 07:55.000
They may not like it, because it's nothing like 2DX, it's more like Guitar Hero, I mean

07:55.000 --> 08:00.000
it's just like the comparison of 2DX and Guitar Hero, they're really not similar at all,

08:00.000 --> 08:04.000
I mean other than you have notes coming down the screen, but that's about it.

08:04.000 --> 08:12.000
The scratching in the game is almost like strumming on the guitar a little bit, and

08:12.000 --> 08:19.000
then the crossfader, it's a lot of, I mean, when you start playing it, it's a lot to

08:19.000 --> 08:26.000
kind of take all in, but then you get used to it, and it can be hard to juggle the crossfader

08:26.000 --> 08:32.000
and the keys and all that stuff sometimes, but it's fun, and I don't know, I enjoy

08:32.000 --> 08:38.000
the game a lot, there's some songs I saw on the full track list I'm not too excited

08:38.000 --> 08:42.000
about, I mean there's especially a lot of songs that are just kind of repeats as far

08:42.000 --> 08:45.000
as what they've used to mix them together, but you know what, I think it'll actually

08:45.000 --> 08:52.000
sound very different, just like I've listened to the two Shout remixes, and they're completely

08:52.000 --> 08:58.000
different, it's just, it's going to be fun, definitely, and as far as playing it, it's

08:58.000 --> 09:02.000
pretty easy to kind of pick up and start, but if you're good at Guitar Hero, I mean

09:02.000 --> 09:06.000
you're still going to have trouble with it, because I had a friend who's, you know,

09:06.000 --> 09:11.000
he can expert almost all the songs in Guitar Hero, and he was struggling just to kind of

09:11.000 --> 09:16.000
get DJ Hero down, but it's kind of a new learning curve, but you'll pick it up pretty

09:16.000 --> 09:21.000
quick, I mean, just from watching the videos, I started off playing Medium, and I picked

09:21.000 --> 09:25.000
it up pretty quick, I kind of want to try hard, I haven't gotten a chance to do that

09:25.000 --> 09:30.000
yet, because also the demo too kind of sucks, because you can't calibrate it, because

09:30.000 --> 09:37.000
it is a demo, and so on the TV we're playing, there's some lag, and so trying to fix that,

09:37.000 --> 09:39.000
you know, you kind of have to compensate for it.

09:39.000 --> 09:41.000
But in the full version, you will be able to get it.

09:41.000 --> 09:43.000
Yeah, in the full version, they'll have all that stuff, it's just, you know, because

09:43.000 --> 09:47.000
it's just a basic demo, they don't have that built in.

09:47.000 --> 09:50.000
Now, this game's going to cost $130, right?

09:50.000 --> 09:54.000
$120, sorry, I think it's $120.

09:54.000 --> 09:55.000
Well, after tax, $130.

09:55.000 --> 09:56.000
$130, yeah.

09:56.000 --> 10:00.000
Let's be real, so this game's going to set you back about $130.

10:00.000 --> 10:05.000
Who should drop, I mean, that's a big investment, I mean, for $70 more you can buy a console,

10:05.000 --> 10:09.000
for $20 more you can buy a Wii, that's as much as a Nintendo DS.

10:09.000 --> 10:11.000
Who should drop $130 on this game?

10:11.000 --> 10:13.000
Who should not drop $130 on this game?

10:13.000 --> 10:17.000
I think if you like music games, you should drop the money, I mean, but the thing is,

10:17.000 --> 10:21.000
you can go to Source now, I mean, Best Buy, I know some Best Buys have this demo unit

10:21.000 --> 10:25.000
set up, I'm sure a lot of them will be getting it if they don't have it yet, GameStop did

10:25.000 --> 10:28.000
a thing this weekend where their stores had a demo unit in-house.

10:28.000 --> 10:29.000
Dark Sakura?

10:29.000 --> 10:33.000
I was going to say, don't drop the money on this game if you're on food stamps.

10:33.000 --> 10:38.000
Well, duh, Dark Sakura, I mean, yeah, if it's not in your budget, then it's not in your

10:38.000 --> 10:41.000
budget, but I mean, if, you know, you're debating.

10:41.000 --> 10:47.000
Yeah, and the other thing you've got to understand is, unlike, you know, Guitar Hero and Rockband,

10:47.000 --> 10:52.000
this controller's only going to work with, you know, this game.

10:52.000 --> 10:53.000
So far?

10:53.000 --> 10:57.000
So far, I mean, it's not going to work, you know, Harmonix is not going to come out with

10:57.000 --> 11:01.000
a DJ game that's going to be exactly like this, and so, you're not going to have, you

11:01.000 --> 11:07.000
know, uniformity that way, so, you know, you've got to be really willing to stick to this

11:07.000 --> 11:11.000
series, and you know what, I, after playing the three songs in there, I'm fine with dropping

11:11.000 --> 11:17.000
the money, and I'll be honest, you know, I know a lot of people frown upon buying demos,

11:17.000 --> 11:22.000
but yes, I bought this demo unit, and yes, it's the same one that you saw on Destructoid,

11:22.000 --> 11:27.000
I bought that unit, I paid the money to buy it, and yeah, I know it's retarded, but I

11:27.000 --> 11:33.000
had nefarious intentions, trust me, originally, but having played it, I probably am going

11:33.000 --> 11:38.000
to buy the full game, only because I can get it early, and that's really why I'm excited

11:38.000 --> 11:43.000
to play this game, but if I wanted to, I could, you know, pirate it, but I'm not going to,

11:43.000 --> 11:46.000
because I won't play it early.

11:46.000 --> 11:50.000
I wasn't going to say anything about how you got this game, because most people would assume

11:50.000 --> 11:52.000
you get it through your work channels, but...

11:52.000 --> 11:54.000
No, no, my work doesn't hook me up for crap.

11:54.000 --> 11:59.000
What possessed you to drop that money on it?

11:59.000 --> 12:02.000
Because I wanted to play it.

12:02.000 --> 12:07.000
Because I'm impatient, and because I figured, I figured, hey, you know what, I can drop

12:07.000 --> 12:13.000
the money on this demo unit, and the controller works just fine, and you know what, I have

12:13.000 --> 12:19.000
the means to play modded games on my console, so if I really want to not spend the money,

12:19.000 --> 12:20.000
I can do that.

12:20.000 --> 12:25.000
Only you can tell you how to spend your money, and the wife now, because that's part of the

12:25.000 --> 12:28.000
whole marriage thing, but hopefully she liked it too.

12:28.000 --> 12:33.000
She hasn't really seen it, she's just like, I don't know, she laughed because Hollaback

12:33.000 --> 12:38.000
Roll is in there, in the demo, but I don't care, you know, because if I don't want to

12:38.000 --> 12:44.000
buy the game, I can still play the game, technically, but I'm not condoning piracy or anything,

12:44.000 --> 12:48.000
and not a lot of people would be pirating this game anyway, since, you know, you need

12:48.000 --> 12:49.000
a controller.

12:49.000 --> 12:51.000
You need a controller for it, yeah.

12:51.000 --> 12:53.000
Alright, let me go to our chat room.

12:53.000 --> 12:56.000
We always have the chat comments here, chat.orangelaungeradio.com.

12:56.000 --> 13:01.000
But for the record, though, I am buying the game on top of this, so I have two controllers,

13:01.000 --> 13:03.000
you know, for party situations and stuff like that.

13:03.000 --> 13:07.000
And, actually, I want to lead into our first chat comment tonight from our chat room that

13:07.000 --> 13:10.000
kind of gets into this a little bit, and our first chat comment tonight comes from our

13:10.000 --> 13:14.000
buddy Derek H., who actually hosts another show here on allgames.com, Dead Pixel Live,

13:14.000 --> 13:18.000
which would technically be the next show on After Orange Launch Radio, just, you have

13:18.000 --> 13:19.000
to wait until Monday.

13:19.000 --> 13:23.000
Derek H. says, "$130, it's catch-22.

13:23.000 --> 13:27.000
To be worth it, you'd need to have a lot of friends, but if you have a lot of friends,

13:27.000 --> 13:30.000
you're not a person who spends $130 on a video game."

13:30.000 --> 13:33.000
I don't know, though, what about, I mean, I get the funny he's trying to make there,

13:33.000 --> 13:35.000
but what about, like, Rock Band?

13:35.000 --> 13:36.000
Rock Band's a party game.

13:36.000 --> 13:41.000
Rock Band, you know, and it's, I don't know, I looked at it, you know, I thought about

13:41.000 --> 13:43.000
it, but I went with it.

13:43.000 --> 13:45.000
I went for it, and you know what, I'm not regretting it.

13:45.000 --> 13:46.000
I like playing it.

13:46.000 --> 13:49.000
But didn't you, it sounds like you had people over to play this game.

13:49.000 --> 13:53.000
Well, I work, yeah, we checked it out and stuff like that, and, you know, I had it hooked

13:53.000 --> 14:00.000
up for an entire day and that kind of thing, but, yeah, it's fun, and I am looking forward

14:00.000 --> 14:07.000
to, and really, I could, I could just skip paying the extra $200, or $100, I'm not buying

14:07.000 --> 14:11.000
the Renegade Edition, that's for sure, because I have a bag to carry this, you know, system

14:11.000 --> 14:16.000
in, and you know what, I don't really need a table to play it on, because I played it

14:16.000 --> 14:21.000
in my lap just fine, so don't buy it, especially if you don't like rap music like me.

14:21.000 --> 14:26.000
I'm not really huge into hip hop and rap music, so, not for me.

14:26.000 --> 14:32.000
But, yeah, I am playing and picking it up, because I'm hoping I get it about a week or

14:32.000 --> 14:34.000
two early, so.

14:34.000 --> 14:37.000
So there, now your day job comes into play.

14:37.000 --> 14:39.000
Yeah, that's where it comes in.

14:39.000 --> 14:41.000
So don't say they don't do crap, because you've got lots of games that way.

14:41.000 --> 14:44.000
Yeah, but they don't give it to me for free, and I have to buy that crap.

14:44.000 --> 14:46.000
All right, fair enough.

14:46.000 --> 14:48.000
All right, so that was your gaming week.

14:48.000 --> 14:51.000
All right, we spent a lot of time talking about DJ Hero, but hey, the game's not out

14:51.000 --> 14:52.000
for, what, two weeks?

14:52.000 --> 14:57.000
Yeah, and it's 27th, I also want to say I finished my cabinet almost, I've been working

14:57.000 --> 15:04.000
on that constantly since I've gotten it, and just today, around 3 o'clock, I finished

15:04.000 --> 15:08.000
putting it all back together and everything, and, you know, played a little bit of New

15:08.000 --> 15:10.000
Mario on there, and it works awesome.

15:10.000 --> 15:17.000
It's just, I have everything done except for I need to modify the kick harness on there

15:17.000 --> 15:23.000
to hook up to what I've got for MAME, and then also have to get two new locks for under

15:23.000 --> 15:31.000
the control panel, because the ones I bought are too short, and then also need to move

15:31.000 --> 15:32.000
it in the house.

15:32.000 --> 15:37.000
Oh, and install Windows and stuff onto my actual PC, because I actually had to custom

15:37.000 --> 15:43.000
build the PC to mount it on this piece of wood and stuff, so I actually made my own

15:43.000 --> 15:45.000
power buttons and stuff like that.

15:45.000 --> 15:46.000
It's ridiculous.

15:46.000 --> 15:50.000
But I have pictures online, and there's pictures posted in chat.

15:50.000 --> 15:51.000
Look at that.

15:51.000 --> 15:55.000
Within seconds, Tiger Claw and SSA100MAT have pictures up.

15:55.000 --> 15:59.000
It's pretty, it looks prettier in the picture than it does in real life, but yeah, all the

15:59.000 --> 16:00.000
buttons have been replaced.

16:00.000 --> 16:01.000
Wait, so you just posted these today?

16:01.000 --> 16:02.000
I just posted them this afternoon.

16:02.000 --> 16:03.000
Oh, I haven't seen this yet.

16:03.000 --> 16:05.000
I haven't checked live during the day, so I haven't seen it.

16:05.000 --> 16:07.000
I painted it black, and it looks awesome.

16:07.000 --> 16:08.000
Wow.

16:08.000 --> 16:09.000
Yeah, it's slick.

16:09.000 --> 16:10.000
Nice.

16:10.000 --> 16:15.000
So you can see there, I had to drill three more holes for additional buttons, and then

16:15.000 --> 16:18.000
if you scroll all the way to the bottom there, you can see-

16:18.000 --> 16:20.000
Why did you make a mess of your garage?

16:20.000 --> 16:22.000
Oh, the garage is a mess, yeah.

16:22.000 --> 16:24.000
I remember when you moved in, that was pristine.

16:24.000 --> 16:25.000
Okay, sorry.

16:25.000 --> 16:26.000
I just, no.

16:26.000 --> 16:28.000
So I had to drill new buttons, but that's the PC right there.

16:28.000 --> 16:31.000
It's a huge, but it's all mounted to a piece of wood.

16:31.000 --> 16:34.000
I had to make custom buttons and stuff like that.

16:34.000 --> 16:37.000
I will post this to our Twitter feed if you're okay with that.

16:37.000 --> 16:38.000
Oh, I'm fine.

16:38.000 --> 16:40.000
I already posted a link to my Twitter.

16:40.000 --> 16:44.000
Folks listening on the podcast can go back and check that out if they want to see it.

16:44.000 --> 16:45.000
Very cool.

16:45.000 --> 16:46.000
Some questions from chat.

16:46.000 --> 16:49.000
Tigerclaw wants to know, so you mounted a motherboard to it.

16:49.000 --> 16:50.000
What about cooling?

16:50.000 --> 16:52.000
Are there any vents on the back, an extra amount of fans?

16:52.000 --> 16:54.000
No, I don't think that I really need all that stuff.

16:54.000 --> 16:58.000
I mean, the cabinet's pretty open in the inside anyways.

16:58.000 --> 17:02.000
I mean, there's a fan on the processor, fan on the graphics card, but I don't think it's

17:02.000 --> 17:05.000
going to get too hot because I'm really not...

17:05.000 --> 17:09.000
I mean, MAME, I don't think it's going to strain that processor too much.

17:09.000 --> 17:10.000
So we'll see.

17:10.000 --> 17:13.000
If I need to put a fan in there, I can.

17:13.000 --> 17:15.000
But, I mean, I don't know.

17:15.000 --> 17:17.000
I don't think it needs it.

17:17.000 --> 17:19.000
I think it'll be fine.

17:19.000 --> 17:21.000
But we'll play it by ear, you know.

17:21.000 --> 17:22.000
All right.

17:22.000 --> 17:23.000
I just put that on the Twitter, by the way.

17:23.000 --> 17:24.000
So there you go.

17:24.000 --> 17:26.000
Anything else, Loki?

17:26.000 --> 17:27.000
That's it.

17:27.000 --> 17:28.000
All right.

17:28.000 --> 17:29.000
My gaming week.

17:29.000 --> 17:30.000
I've actually had some time to play some games this week.

17:30.000 --> 17:33.000
I just want to point this out, and I know I'm going to get criticized by a lot of folks.

17:33.000 --> 17:36.000
I still haven't fixed the 360.

17:36.000 --> 17:38.000
I kind of don't need to right now.

17:38.000 --> 17:43.000
I've totally been happy in my gaming world with World of Warcraft, of course, and PlayStation

17:43.000 --> 17:44.000
3.

17:44.000 --> 17:50.000
I hate to admit it because we've been so critical of Sony for a long time, but when Sony does

17:50.000 --> 17:53.000
things right, I think we should admit when they've done things right.

17:53.000 --> 17:57.000
And I think this price drop was really the right thing, and it could have happened a

17:57.000 --> 17:59.000
long time ago, granted.

17:59.000 --> 18:01.000
And I think PS3 is moving in a pretty good direction.

18:01.000 --> 18:08.000
And one reason why I'm saying that is because finally we got another really good PlayStation

18:08.000 --> 18:11.000
3 exclusive game this week, and that's one of the games I've been playing this week,

18:11.000 --> 18:14.000
is Demon's Souls.

18:14.000 --> 18:15.000
Here's the thing, though.

18:15.000 --> 18:17.000
Demon's Souls is not for everybody.

18:17.000 --> 18:19.000
It's, from what I hear, it is hard.

18:19.000 --> 18:22.000
I've dropped probably four or five hours in this game.

18:22.000 --> 18:24.000
I've rolled three different characters.

18:24.000 --> 18:28.000
I've beaten the tutorial level, and I consistently get my ass handed to me in the first level.

18:28.000 --> 18:30.000
It is that hard of a game.

18:30.000 --> 18:36.000
This game is the Mega Man 9 of role-playing games, although I don't want to think role-playing

18:36.000 --> 18:41.000
games as like Final Fantasy role-playing game because it's more of an action-y RPG.

18:41.000 --> 18:44.000
Think a little more like Oblivion in the third person.

18:44.000 --> 18:48.000
This game is so hardcore, it's like D&D.

18:48.000 --> 18:50.000
I mean, you have to consider everything.

18:50.000 --> 18:54.000
You have to consider the weights of the weapons you're carrying, all these different statistics.

18:54.000 --> 18:55.000
There's no pause.

18:55.000 --> 18:57.000
There is no pause in this game.

18:57.000 --> 19:00.000
There is no pause in this game because the game's online.

19:00.000 --> 19:02.000
And this is the interesting thing.

19:02.000 --> 19:06.000
This is the part that makes Demon's Souls fascinating is the online component because

19:06.000 --> 19:08.000
it's not an MMO.

19:08.000 --> 19:10.000
It's not a single-player role-playing game.

19:10.000 --> 19:13.000
Let me give you an idea of the types of stuff you do in this game.

19:13.000 --> 19:17.000
You can leave markings on the ground that have little messages for other people,

19:17.000 --> 19:19.000
but you can't type in your own messages.

19:19.000 --> 19:20.000
Sorry, Loki.

19:20.000 --> 19:24.000
You have to choose from like a predetermined set that kind of works like a mad lib.

19:24.000 --> 19:28.000
In other words, you can put down a sentence that says, beware of blank ahead.

19:28.000 --> 19:30.000
And then the next screen would say, what do you want to be in the blank?

19:30.000 --> 19:33.000
Enemies, gold, trap, what do you want it to say?

19:33.000 --> 19:38.000
So you put these mad lib-ish type warnings down, and then people can rate these messages up.

19:38.000 --> 19:41.000
And if they get rated up, your character gets healed.

19:41.000 --> 19:43.000
You might suddenly see a message pop on your screen.

19:43.000 --> 19:47.000
Your message has been rated up, and you get a little bit of life point back,

19:47.000 --> 19:51.000
which is good because otherwise you can't really get it back very easily.

19:51.000 --> 19:55.000
And then if it sucks, well, your message just never shows up in other people's worlds.

19:55.000 --> 19:58.000
The less it gets rated, the less it just goes away.

19:58.000 --> 20:00.000
The other component is that you'll have blood stains.

20:00.000 --> 20:03.000
When people die in the world, their blood stain appears,

20:03.000 --> 20:06.000
and you can touch the blood stain and watch how they die.

20:06.000 --> 20:07.000
That's awesome.

20:07.000 --> 20:08.000
Which is kind of interesting.

20:08.000 --> 20:14.000
It helps you learn lessons because there's little surprises around every corner and all this stuff.

20:14.000 --> 20:16.000
So here's the thing, though.

20:16.000 --> 20:18.000
Here's how unforgiving the game is.

20:18.000 --> 20:20.000
The currency of the game is souls.

20:20.000 --> 20:22.000
Souls by beating monsters.

20:22.000 --> 20:26.000
If you die in a level, you go all the way back to start.

20:26.000 --> 20:33.000
You lose all your souls, all of them, and the whole level starts over.

20:33.000 --> 20:39.000
If you can get back to where your blood stain was and touch it, you get all your souls back.

20:39.000 --> 20:41.000
If you die again, you're fucked.

20:41.000 --> 20:42.000
It's gone.

20:42.000 --> 20:44.000
You lose everything.

20:44.000 --> 20:46.000
This game is not messing around.

20:46.000 --> 20:49.000
It is a very, very difficult game.

20:49.000 --> 20:52.000
When I say it is the Mega Man 9 of role-playing games, I'm not kidding.

20:52.000 --> 20:53.000
You know how Mega Man 9 is?

20:53.000 --> 20:59.000
You have to go in, you have to die, die, die, and learn a distinct pattern in how to beat the level.

20:59.000 --> 21:03.000
Once you learn the pattern to beat the level, it's never a problem again.

21:03.000 --> 21:05.000
That's very similar to what this game is.

21:05.000 --> 21:07.000
As I'm going through the level,

21:07.000 --> 21:08.000
oh, demon hiding behind the wood,

21:08.000 --> 21:10.000
oh, demon hiding around the corner,

21:10.000 --> 21:11.000
oh, two demons over here,

21:11.000 --> 21:13.000
you start to learn the patterns.

21:13.000 --> 21:18.000
It just is difficult still for me because a lot of it has to do with timing.

21:18.000 --> 21:21.000
If you want to beat really hard enemies, you have to be able to block

21:21.000 --> 21:25.000
and then basically jab your sword into the enemy.

21:25.000 --> 21:27.000
It gets really hard.

21:27.000 --> 21:32.000
I'm just saying this game is not fucking around with the difficulty.

21:32.000 --> 21:37.000
If you think you're going to throw a controller across the room, you probably will.

21:37.000 --> 21:41.000
That's where you might need to decide if this game is worth dropping $60 on or not

21:41.000 --> 21:47.000
because I think the challenge is this game's biggest asset and it's game's biggest drawback.

21:47.000 --> 21:53.000
I usually don't go on and read internet reviews of games before I review it myself

21:53.000 --> 21:56.000
because I'm afraid I'm going to steal things from reviews,

21:56.000 --> 21:57.000
but I had to do it this way.

21:57.000 --> 22:00.000
It just indirectly might say something that I read in a review,

22:00.000 --> 22:02.000
but I have to repeat this.

22:02.000 --> 22:03.000
This was on a review somewhere.

22:03.000 --> 22:07.000
It is the anti-casual game, I think is the perfect way to describe this game.

22:07.000 --> 22:09.000
It is the anti-casual game.

22:09.000 --> 22:11.000
It's R-Type.

22:11.000 --> 22:13.000
Is it a rewarding experience though?

22:13.000 --> 22:18.000
Heck yeah because it feels really good when you are able to successfully beat a level

22:18.000 --> 22:20.000
and get past a point you've never got before.

22:20.000 --> 22:24.000
That's a reward you haven't really seen since 8-bit gaming days.

22:24.000 --> 22:26.000
One other thing I do want to say about online mode.

22:26.000 --> 22:28.000
I haven't gotten to this part myself,

22:28.000 --> 22:32.000
but apparently this gets in later on after you beat the first couple levels

22:32.000 --> 22:37.000
is that when you die or I guess some of the stains on the floor

22:37.000 --> 22:41.000
start being that you can warp yourself into someone else's world

22:41.000 --> 22:43.000
and help them beat the boss,

22:43.000 --> 22:48.000
or you can go into someone else's world as a black phantom and try to kill them.

22:48.000 --> 22:51.000
So now you can be the enemy in someone else's world.

22:51.000 --> 22:52.000
That's awesome.

22:52.000 --> 22:54.000
And you get rewarded if you kill the other player.

22:54.000 --> 22:55.000
But here's the other thing to keep in mind.

22:55.000 --> 22:57.000
There is no friends list in this game.

22:57.000 --> 22:59.000
There is no voice chat in the game.

22:59.000 --> 23:01.000
It is all anonymous.

23:01.000 --> 23:03.000
So when you're the black phantom, you're a silent killer.

23:03.000 --> 23:06.000
They don't even know who killed them.

23:06.000 --> 23:08.000
That sounds like fun.

23:08.000 --> 23:12.000
The tricky thing about being the phantom is that if you're just out there,

23:12.000 --> 23:15.000
I think they purposely make the phantoms a little weaker,

23:15.000 --> 23:18.000
but if you know the levels, if you've really worked at the levels,

23:18.000 --> 23:21.000
and you kind of know the good hiding spaces like around corners and stuff,

23:21.000 --> 23:25.000
you can just beat the shit out of somebody that you storm in their level.

23:25.000 --> 23:26.000
That's awesome.

23:26.000 --> 23:28.000
Loki, I think you would sit there all day

23:28.000 --> 23:31.000
and be the black phantom on people's levels and have fun with it.

23:31.000 --> 23:35.000
You should see me play Grand Theft Auto, man.

23:35.000 --> 23:38.000
What we've been doing now where we have random people coming into our games,

23:38.000 --> 23:40.000
because we do ranked games now,

23:40.000 --> 23:43.000
so basically if you sign on to a ranked game when we're online playing a ranked game

23:43.000 --> 23:46.000
or in the lobby, you will be in our ranked game.

23:46.000 --> 23:49.000
And then I will mock you on our end,

23:49.000 --> 23:54.000
because no one realizes that all five of us or four of us are in the same room.

23:54.000 --> 23:56.000
So we'll be like, okay, he's coming around the corner.

23:56.000 --> 23:57.000
Boom!

23:57.000 --> 24:00.000
Just knock the guy down and we'll kind of not really gang up on them,

24:00.000 --> 24:03.000
but we'll help each other.

24:03.000 --> 24:06.000
Oh, man, I talk shit when other people are in there.

24:06.000 --> 24:07.000
It's awesome.

24:07.000 --> 24:09.000
Going to some comments from our chat, chat.orangelandsradio.com,

24:09.000 --> 24:13.000
Kitsune says, by that means, they can come into your world and kill you.

24:13.000 --> 24:14.000
Yes, they can.

24:14.000 --> 24:17.000
I am told the game warns you when a black phantom has entered your level,

24:17.000 --> 24:20.000
but it doesn't tell you anything beyond that.

24:20.000 --> 24:23.000
And let's see, Hitstun says, this sounds awesome.

24:23.000 --> 24:25.000
Too bad it's a PS3 exclusive.

24:25.000 --> 24:26.000
That's actually my point, Hitstun.

24:26.000 --> 24:29.000
That's why I said kind of before I went into this story,

24:29.000 --> 24:33.000
Sony's finally gaining some ground moving into this holiday season.

24:33.000 --> 24:37.000
Sony PS3 has had some great exclusives.

24:37.000 --> 24:39.000
For the platformers, they have LittleBigPlanet.

24:39.000 --> 24:41.000
For the first-person shooters, they have Resistance.

24:41.000 --> 24:45.000
Now they have something for the action RPGers, and that's Demon's Souls.

24:45.000 --> 24:47.000
And to some extent, you could say Valkyria Chronicles 2,

24:47.000 --> 24:52.000
although that's more of a, you know, why can't I think of the name all of a sudden?

24:52.000 --> 24:53.000
Real?

24:53.000 --> 24:54.000
The strategy, RTS game.

24:54.000 --> 24:55.000
Thank you.

24:55.000 --> 24:57.000
Leo Shen wants to know how far did I get.

24:57.000 --> 25:00.000
Dude, I can't even beat Voltaria Palace 1-1.

25:00.000 --> 25:02.000
That's how hard this game is.

25:02.000 --> 25:06.000
Like, I keep getting killed by the blue-eyed guy.

25:06.000 --> 25:07.000
But I'm trying.

25:07.000 --> 25:10.000
I just, I keep rerolling characters to think it can,

25:10.000 --> 25:15.000
I actually hear the easiest way through it is with the royalty character,

25:15.000 --> 25:17.000
because even though they start at the lowest level, they have the soul arrow,

25:17.000 --> 25:19.000
so that's what I'm trying to do now.

25:19.000 --> 25:21.000
But I'm finding it makes you really weak.

25:21.000 --> 25:24.000
So I got gang raped by two fire-wielding guys.

25:24.000 --> 25:27.000
I can't even get back to where I was with my soldier.

25:27.000 --> 25:31.000
Anyhow, Demon's Souls is the name of the game.

25:31.000 --> 25:34.000
One other game I do want to mention that I played, another PS3 exclusive,

25:34.000 --> 25:37.000
go figure, Katamari Forever on the PlayStation 3.

25:37.000 --> 25:39.000
I did pick up this week, finally.

25:39.000 --> 25:40.000
It's a little cheaper than Demon's Souls.

25:40.000 --> 25:42.000
Demon's Souls set me back 60.

25:42.000 --> 25:45.000
I believe Katamari Forever was 49.99 or 50.

25:45.000 --> 25:46.000
Yeah, 40.

25:46.000 --> 25:49.000
So it's a little cheaper, but you know what?

25:49.000 --> 25:52.000
I had more fun playing this than I did the Xbox 360 version,

25:52.000 --> 25:53.000
beautiful Katamari.

25:53.000 --> 25:55.000
I don't know why.

25:55.000 --> 25:56.000
I'm not trying to hate on 360.

25:56.000 --> 26:00.000
I do miss my 360, and I will be getting it fixed soon

26:00.000 --> 26:06.000
when I finally can't resist anymore wanting to play Beatles Rock Band

26:06.000 --> 26:08.000
and some of the other online games I've been missing out on

26:08.000 --> 26:11.000
while my 360 has been broken.

26:11.000 --> 26:13.000
But I will say Katamari Forever is really cool.

26:13.000 --> 26:14.000
I love the way it controls.

26:14.000 --> 26:17.000
The music is cute, having it back in the levels.

26:17.000 --> 26:20.000
I have to admit, I haven't fully explored the game,

26:20.000 --> 26:22.000
because I've been kind of a little busy playing Demon's Souls

26:22.000 --> 26:23.000
and killing in that game.

26:23.000 --> 26:28.000
But I'm already having more fun with this than I was the 360 version of the game,

26:28.000 --> 26:32.000
even though this admittedly is a rehash of a lot of the levels.

26:32.000 --> 26:35.000
But what I like is that they do put new elements in the levels.

26:35.000 --> 26:39.000
You can go back and play the old levels as the old levels if you want.

26:39.000 --> 26:41.000
And to be honest, I haven't played the game in so long

26:41.000 --> 26:44.000
that all the levels are feeling new to me again

26:44.000 --> 26:46.000
after two, three years of not playing it.

26:46.000 --> 26:49.000
But I do think the price point may be a little high

26:49.000 --> 26:52.000
considering that a lot of it is recycled.

26:52.000 --> 26:55.000
If you've never played Katamari Damacy before, though,

26:55.000 --> 26:57.000
this is a really good entry-level game.

26:57.000 --> 27:01.000
If you have all the other games, you might want to wait for a price drop.

27:01.000 --> 27:03.000
I just think for a lot of folks, 50 bucks,

27:03.000 --> 27:05.000
unless you're a hardcore fan of the series,

27:05.000 --> 27:07.000
you're going to be like, come on, too much.

27:07.000 --> 27:10.000
So there you go.

27:10.000 --> 27:13.000
All right, so that was pretty much my gaming week.

27:13.000 --> 27:16.000
I did play some other stuff, but I've talked too much about the other games.

27:16.000 --> 27:18.000
I want to get into some gaming news.

27:18.000 --> 27:19.000
I know you guys do, too.

27:19.000 --> 27:20.000
We're going to get into it.

27:20.000 --> 27:22.000
First off, some housekeeping real quick.

27:22.000 --> 27:24.000
The podcast feed is behind.

27:24.000 --> 27:27.000
I'm sorry about that, but vacations will do that.

27:27.000 --> 27:31.000
I did get 338 on the feed tonight, so all that's left is 339 in the mini show.

27:31.000 --> 27:34.000
So those will go up this week before this week's show does.

27:34.000 --> 27:39.000
So part of the problem was that when I was last here at Dark Soccer's house,

27:39.000 --> 27:42.000
I didn't upload 339 to our server.

27:42.000 --> 27:44.000
I uploaded 329.

27:44.000 --> 27:47.000
So I was never going to be able to put up more than what I put up today.

27:47.000 --> 27:50.000
So that was my bad, and I'm sorry for being lazy.

27:50.000 --> 27:55.000
But vacations happen, so I guess more incentive to tune in live when you can,

27:55.000 --> 27:57.000
but I will try to be better for the podcast feed listeners.

27:57.000 --> 28:00.000
I know you guys have been kind of pooped on a lot in 2009,

28:00.000 --> 28:02.000
so I apologize for that.

28:02.000 --> 28:04.000
Anyhow, that's really it.

28:04.000 --> 28:06.000
Otherwise, go ahead and add us on Twitter.

28:06.000 --> 28:09.000
We are soon going to have a new Facebook fan page.

28:09.000 --> 28:10.000
I know we have our Facebook forums,

28:10.000 --> 28:12.000
but we're actually going to work on building a fan page

28:12.000 --> 28:16.000
so that way we can notify you about new shows in your friend feed

28:16.000 --> 28:17.000
if you want.

28:17.000 --> 28:20.000
If you don't want it, add us anyway, and then block our updates, whatever.

28:20.000 --> 28:23.000
But we're going to actually work on an official Orange Laundry Radio page

28:23.000 --> 28:25.000
that will hopefully be open this week.

28:25.000 --> 28:27.000
And then, of course, we still have our live journal,

28:27.000 --> 28:29.000
our website, orangelaundryradio.com, and so forth.

28:29.000 --> 28:31.000
Let's get into some actual gaming news now.

28:31.000 --> 28:34.000
Thirty minutes into the show, we can finally talk gaming news.

28:34.000 --> 28:37.000
There's been quite a bit in the time we've been gone.

28:37.000 --> 28:39.000
Loki, start us off tonight, if you would.

28:39.000 --> 28:41.000
Yes, and it's interesting.

28:41.000 --> 28:46.000
The game that was kind of teased around, and actually it was pretty sweet

28:46.000 --> 28:48.000
from the concept art that was leaked,

28:48.000 --> 28:53.000
Epic Mickey has been confirmed via the newest Game Informer.

28:53.000 --> 28:55.000
It's on the cover.

28:55.000 --> 28:58.000
And, of course, they have the inside story about that as well.

28:58.000 --> 29:01.000
The game is being done by War Inspector,

29:01.000 --> 29:04.000
and it's actually pretty sweet looking.

29:04.000 --> 29:08.000
It takes place kind of in this dark Disney-type world

29:08.000 --> 29:14.000
where Mickey will actually be facing up against some forgotten Disney characters

29:14.000 --> 29:17.000
who are all really twisted looking.

29:17.000 --> 29:20.000
I mean, this stuff is like some Alice McGee type of stuff,

29:20.000 --> 29:24.000
but apparently the villain in the game is supposed to be Oswald the Rabbit,

29:24.000 --> 29:29.000
who I had no idea who he was, so therefore perfect for this,

29:29.000 --> 29:34.000
since it's a character that's been forgotten.

29:34.000 --> 29:37.000
Very cool looking game, and right now it's been confirmed

29:37.000 --> 29:43.000
to be exclusive for the Wii, but it might actually be coming out later on,

29:43.000 --> 29:44.000
maybe on some other platforms.

29:44.000 --> 29:47.000
I hope it actually comes out on 360 or PS3,

29:47.000 --> 29:50.000
because the visuals that they have right now in the concept art look awesome,

29:50.000 --> 29:53.000
and I just don't know if it's going to translate well over to the Wii,

29:53.000 --> 29:56.000
but definitely want to play this game.

29:56.000 --> 29:58.000
It's a pretty epic looking RPG.

29:58.000 --> 30:02.000
Have we seen much outside of the one screenshot that's on the magazine cover?

30:02.000 --> 30:06.000
They've had artwork put out from it, and it looks really dark.

30:06.000 --> 30:09.000
I'm almost surprised it's even on the Wii.

30:09.000 --> 30:13.000
Well, the Wii's kind of needed something like Epic Mickey,

30:13.000 --> 30:15.000
so I get it, and I'm going to give it a chance.

30:15.000 --> 30:17.000
I think a lot of people are like,

30:17.000 --> 30:22.000
boo, this isn't coming to 360 or PS3, it can't be that epic,

30:22.000 --> 30:24.000
but I'm saying, wait a minute, give this a chance,

30:24.000 --> 30:28.000
because what this game's trying to do is fill a niche that the Wii doesn't have,

30:28.000 --> 30:30.000
because the Wii right now is known as a shovelware system

30:30.000 --> 30:34.000
with the occasional awesome Metroid or Mario game.

30:34.000 --> 30:36.000
That's what the Wii is right now.

30:36.000 --> 30:39.000
So, okay, let's give Epic Mickey a chance to fill a void that's needed.

30:39.000 --> 30:42.000
So I'm hopeful, even though, yeah, I can't be high def,

30:42.000 --> 30:45.000
graphics aren't everything, let's remember that.

30:45.000 --> 30:48.000
And right now, the reason why it's on the Wii exclusively

30:48.000 --> 30:53.000
is because the control system that's in the game relies on motion controls,

30:53.000 --> 30:58.000
and since I don't know when it's going to be coming out,

30:58.000 --> 31:00.000
if it's spring next year, it might be too early,

31:00.000 --> 31:03.000
maybe they don't have time to work with development kits for Natal,

31:03.000 --> 31:07.000
or whatever they're calling the PlayStation 3 motion controller.

31:07.000 --> 31:09.000
We'll see more of these games later on.

31:09.000 --> 31:11.000
And who's to say that they couldn't, if this is really popular,

31:11.000 --> 31:16.000
do a sequel, it'll be on all platforms, or even port this later on.

31:16.000 --> 31:18.000
So I wouldn't rule it out, but...

31:18.000 --> 31:20.000
Well, here's my thing, though.

31:20.000 --> 31:22.000
What's wrong with Kingdom Hearts?

31:22.000 --> 31:25.000
I mean, isn't Kingdom Hearts, in a way, epic Mickey?

31:25.000 --> 31:27.000
I mean, I realize that games are going to be different.

31:27.000 --> 31:30.000
I realize this is not going to be a role-playing game or what have you.

31:30.000 --> 31:33.000
I kind of look at this and go, is this going to kill off Kingdom Hearts?

31:33.000 --> 31:35.000
Because that's kind of too bad.

31:35.000 --> 31:38.000
Because Kingdom Hearts, I always thought, was kind of an epic Mickey.

31:38.000 --> 31:39.000
I mean, yeah, I was...

31:39.000 --> 31:41.000
I don't think it co-exists.

31:41.000 --> 31:42.000
I hope so.

31:42.000 --> 31:46.000
But, I mean, there was always those rumors that Kingdom Hearts 3,

31:46.000 --> 31:50.000
whenever it actually happens, was going to do away with the Disney.

31:50.000 --> 31:52.000
I mean, is that what we're looking at?

31:52.000 --> 31:54.000
Now the Disney is over here?

31:54.000 --> 31:58.000
I mean, I guess we don't know until we really get some final words on Kingdom Hearts 3.

31:58.000 --> 32:02.000
But how much Disney is involved with these handheld Kingdom Hearts games?

32:02.000 --> 32:05.000
I've got to admit, I haven't been following the handheld Kingdom Hearts games.

32:05.000 --> 32:06.000
Maybe the chat can help.

32:06.000 --> 32:07.000
I don't really know.

32:07.000 --> 32:11.000
Chatters, how much Disney are in those handheld Kingdom Hearts games?

32:11.000 --> 32:14.000
I mean, are they already phasing the Disney out?

32:14.000 --> 32:16.000
I'm not really sure.

32:16.000 --> 32:20.000
I never played the DS version that just came out, so I don't know.

32:20.000 --> 32:23.000
All right, well, granted the games can co-exist,

32:23.000 --> 32:27.000
and we can't really rate this game until it's actually out.

32:27.000 --> 32:31.000
But I do kind of pose that question, is that, well, isn't Kingdom Hearts, in some extent,

32:31.000 --> 32:33.000
kind of an epic Mickey game?

32:33.000 --> 32:37.000
And, granted, you can still have Kingdom Hearts co-exist with

32:37.000 --> 32:41.000
Happy Birthday Disney Princess or whatever that game is on the Wii.

32:41.000 --> 32:44.000
It's not like Kingdom Hearts is the sole only Disney game.

32:44.000 --> 32:47.000
And X-Link confirms, yes, there is a lot in the games.

32:47.000 --> 32:51.000
So whatever I heard about Disney being phased out is just a sick rumor.

32:51.000 --> 32:56.000
Although, I will tell you, being at Disneyland twice in the past month,

32:56.000 --> 32:58.000
there isn't a lot of Kingdom Hearts.

32:58.000 --> 33:01.000
In fact, there is no Kingdom Hearts references in either park.

33:01.000 --> 33:05.000
Which, I understand, because Square Enix, that's really their thing.

33:05.000 --> 33:10.000
But you would think it still raises Disney awareness as kind of a bummer.

33:10.000 --> 33:14.000
They don't have at least a Sora something to buy.

33:14.000 --> 33:17.000
Well, it looks like, though, this game is going to be more like Disney Park stuff

33:17.000 --> 33:21.000
because they show, kind of in the concept art here,

33:21.000 --> 33:25.000
they have the castle in the background, they've got the Haunted Mansion in there.

33:25.000 --> 33:29.000
They also have, you know, it's a small world in there.

33:29.000 --> 33:31.000
They've got, you know, the characters.

33:31.000 --> 33:36.000
They have, it looks like, it's just, it's going to be awesome.

33:36.000 --> 33:39.000
I'm worried that it's going to be too dark and the people are going to be like,

33:39.000 --> 33:43.000
oh my god, this is, you know, my kids are going to get nightmares from this, you know.

33:43.000 --> 33:47.000
Because some of the creatures that they've shown so far are pretty creepy

33:47.000 --> 33:50.000
and for a little kid, it would not be appropriate for them.

33:50.000 --> 33:53.000
But is it going to be dark in like a, I mean, let's face it,

33:53.000 --> 33:55.000
there's a lot of dark things at Disneyland now.

33:55.000 --> 33:58.000
It's Halloween time there. They have Haunted Mansion.

33:58.000 --> 33:59.000
I guess it would...

33:59.000 --> 34:02.000
The ghost galaxy, if I were a little kid, would be freaked out by it.

34:02.000 --> 34:04.000
As an adult, I think it's funny.

34:04.000 --> 34:09.000
I think it's dark as in like, you know, the toys, I guess, like, you know, in Toy Story,

34:09.000 --> 34:12.000
how they had the toys that the neighbor kid, you know, put together

34:12.000 --> 34:15.000
and they're all creepy looking like the baby doll head.

34:15.000 --> 34:16.000
That was a spider thing.

34:16.000 --> 34:20.000
Imagine that but with Disney head, you know, characters of Disney

34:20.000 --> 34:24.000
with their heads all over the place and machine parts and claws and stuff all over the place.

34:24.000 --> 34:26.000
I can't believe Disney would allow that.

34:26.000 --> 34:28.000
That just seems weird to me.

34:28.000 --> 34:32.000
Like, non-distinct heads and things I would get or a nightmare before Christmas.

34:32.000 --> 34:36.000
Like, I'll see if I can pull up some pictures for you and check it out.

34:36.000 --> 34:40.000
Reading some comments from chat, because there's a lot of talk in chat about Epic Mickey,

34:40.000 --> 34:45.000
Black Wolf says, I do know that Square and Disney don't like each other, at least in the US.

34:45.000 --> 34:49.000
Kitsune says, even at Tokyo Disney, nothing from Kingdom Hearts.

34:49.000 --> 34:52.000
I guess Kitsune has been there recently.

34:52.000 --> 34:56.000
Tigerclaw says, oh my, I would imagine during the It's a Small World level,

34:56.000 --> 35:00.000
the gamers will be tortured with that music playing on repeat.

35:00.000 --> 35:04.000
So, like, here's some concept art that they had for Epic Mickey.

35:04.000 --> 35:06.000
It's kind of very steampunk-ish.

35:06.000 --> 35:10.000
Like, they have this, like, you know, ship thing with Epcot on there.

35:10.000 --> 35:17.000
They've got, you know, just, like, some characters running around and, like, machines and stuff.

35:17.000 --> 35:22.000
Like, there's Goofy right there that looks like a zombie almost.

35:22.000 --> 35:25.000
Some, like, twisted, I don't even know what that is, you know.

35:25.000 --> 35:30.000
This is, you know what this is? This is, like, the Return to Oz of Disney.

35:30.000 --> 35:32.000
Did anyone ever see Return to Oz when they were kids?

35:32.000 --> 35:33.000
It was awesome.

35:33.000 --> 35:34.000
And read the books, too.

35:34.000 --> 35:35.000
In the 80s? Dude.

35:35.000 --> 35:38.000
Okay, for those that never saw Return to Oz back in the 80s,

35:38.000 --> 35:42.000
because I was, like, seven when this movie came out, which means half our listeners weren't even born.

35:42.000 --> 35:46.000
But here's the thing is that, okay, when Return to Oz came out,

35:46.000 --> 35:48.000
first off, Feruza Balk was Dorothy.

35:48.000 --> 35:51.000
And if you don't know who she is, she was, like, the twisted chick in the craft.

35:51.000 --> 35:53.000
I don't know what else she's been in lately.

35:53.000 --> 35:55.000
But she was in American History X, I think, and something else.

35:55.000 --> 35:56.000
Okay, she was Dorothy.

35:56.000 --> 36:00.000
And, like, the movie started out with her in an insane asylum, right?

36:00.000 --> 36:07.000
And she goes, and she goes to this area where the witch, whoever she was, the bad witch,

36:07.000 --> 36:10.000
and you all forgive me, my details of the story are scattered.

36:10.000 --> 36:11.000
Maybe Jamie can help.

36:11.000 --> 36:12.000
She was another princess.

36:12.000 --> 36:13.000
Oh, was she another princess?

36:13.000 --> 36:14.000
She collected heads in jars.

36:14.000 --> 36:16.000
Of pretty women.

36:16.000 --> 36:18.000
Yeah, she was after Dorothy's head to get.

36:18.000 --> 36:21.000
So she was, like, and you would actually see, like, the heads in jars and things.

36:21.000 --> 36:27.000
And, like, you saw all your favorite, like, characters from The Wizard of Oz, like,

36:27.000 --> 36:32.000
Turn to Stone and, like, Frozen and Time, and it was a very dark-looking world.

36:32.000 --> 36:36.000
I mean, for the, and this was, I believe, a movie Disney put out, wasn't it?

36:36.000 --> 36:37.000
Maybe.

36:37.000 --> 36:42.000
Yeah, well, even that, though, the characters that pick up along the way, like TikTok,

36:42.000 --> 36:47.000
he was a different clockwork man, and he looked a bit more.

36:47.000 --> 36:52.000
But when they brought in the Scarecrow and Tin Man and all of them, they looked very...

36:52.000 --> 36:54.000
They looked like the old book.

36:54.000 --> 36:55.000
Burtonized.

36:55.000 --> 36:56.000
Yeah.

36:56.000 --> 37:02.000
If I remember right, this movie took so long to come out because MGM had to lose the rights

37:02.000 --> 37:06.000
to make the future Oz movies, and I think Disney put this one out.

37:06.000 --> 37:09.000
So it was really weird that it was kind of a darker movie.

37:09.000 --> 37:13.000
So, you know, Disney is capable of doing darker things.

37:13.000 --> 37:16.000
It is just surprising that it would be their character.

37:16.000 --> 37:18.000
That's why I'm calling this the return to Oz of new years.

37:18.000 --> 37:21.000
If you don't know what I'm talking about, this movie's like a cult classic now.

37:21.000 --> 37:22.000
It's out on DVD.

37:22.000 --> 37:23.000
It's awesome.

37:23.000 --> 37:24.000
Check it out.

37:24.000 --> 37:25.000
It is a pretty awesome movie.

37:25.000 --> 37:28.000
Like, it just, it'll warp your fragile little seven-year-old mind if you have kids.

37:28.000 --> 37:32.000
It's, if you can't stand The Wizard of Oz, this movie is awesome.

37:32.000 --> 37:33.000
I mean, because it's actually...

37:33.000 --> 37:36.000
I think they should go back and do all the Oz movies this kind of style because it'd

37:36.000 --> 37:37.000
be really sweet.

37:37.000 --> 37:43.000
But anyways, so yeah, really creepy shit, you know, that's in all these concept things.

37:43.000 --> 37:45.000
And so I hope they stick to it.

37:45.000 --> 37:49.000
I mean, I hope they stick to their guns and try something risky because you know what?

37:49.000 --> 37:54.000
You can put out a game for Disney's Princess and the Frog, you know,

37:54.000 --> 37:57.000
and it may sell X number of copies or whatever, and that's fine.

37:57.000 --> 37:58.000
But you know what?

37:58.000 --> 38:00.000
Do something ballsy, and you know what?

38:00.000 --> 38:03.000
It will, they'll get a good return on it.

38:03.000 --> 38:05.000
Because gamers will buy it.

38:05.000 --> 38:09.000
I'm curious, you know, and then I'm looking at the big picture is that what could this,

38:09.000 --> 38:13.000
you know, if this does really, really well, what could this mean for, like,

38:13.000 --> 38:15.000
what would happen at Disneyland and some of these places?

38:15.000 --> 38:18.000
Like, could we get, like, an attraction based off of, like, creepy Disney?

38:18.000 --> 38:20.000
I don't know.

38:20.000 --> 38:22.000
Maybe a California adventure.

38:22.000 --> 38:23.000
Maybe.

38:23.000 --> 38:24.000
All right.

38:24.000 --> 38:28.000
Anyhow, Kitsune, by the way, had never heard of Return to Oz, I guess,

38:28.000 --> 38:30.000
and is very excited about the movie.

38:30.000 --> 38:34.000
Put the trailer in chat and says, somehow this feels like Labyrinth.

38:34.000 --> 38:36.000
Well, it came out around that same time.

38:36.000 --> 38:37.000
It does feel kind of like Labyrinth.

38:37.000 --> 38:38.000
It was a lot like Labyrinth.

38:38.000 --> 38:41.000
I mean, this was that time in the 80s when you had, like, Never Ending Story,

38:41.000 --> 38:44.000
Labyrinth, Dark Crystal, you know, Return to Oz.

38:44.000 --> 38:46.000
They all came out right around the same time.

38:46.000 --> 38:50.000
You know, they were all in that mid-early 80s phase, so.

38:50.000 --> 38:53.000
The golden age of, you know, adventure movies.

38:53.000 --> 38:55.000
Of fucking up children's minds.

38:55.000 --> 38:58.000
Seriously, those are some fucked up movies we had as a kid.

38:58.000 --> 39:01.000
Say my name!

39:01.000 --> 39:05.000
And then you never really understood what the hell her name was.

39:05.000 --> 39:06.000
I never got that.

39:06.000 --> 39:09.000
They said what it was.

39:09.000 --> 39:10.000
I used to know.

39:10.000 --> 39:12.000
Crap, I'll have to look it up again.

39:12.000 --> 39:14.000
I think we even tried turning on the subtitles once

39:14.000 --> 39:16.000
to find out what her goddamn name was,

39:16.000 --> 39:20.000
and it said Untangible or something.

39:20.000 --> 39:24.000
Or Scream's name or something like that, where I was like, dammit!

39:24.000 --> 39:26.000
All right, anyhow.

39:26.000 --> 39:29.000
Moving on to some more gaming news, because Epic Mickey does sound pretty epic.

39:29.000 --> 39:31.000
But moving on back to the 360, and I got to say,

39:31.000 --> 39:33.000
the early screenshots for this look kind of cool.

39:33.000 --> 39:36.000
It's something called the Retrocade.

39:36.000 --> 39:38.000
Now, this isn't something that's confirmed.

39:38.000 --> 39:42.000
I want to point out, this is news and rumors coming to us from a survey

39:42.000 --> 39:44.000
that is currently out there with consumers.

39:44.000 --> 39:46.000
And of course, when a survey goes out there,

39:46.000 --> 39:49.000
somebody's going to take screen prints of it and send it to your favorite gaming blogs.

39:49.000 --> 39:52.000
This is a project that's known as a lot of different names,

39:52.000 --> 39:53.000
according to the survey.

39:53.000 --> 39:58.000
Game Room, Retrocade, Tower of Rom, Classics Live.

39:58.000 --> 40:02.000
Tower of Rom is kind of awesome, although I don't see that being the actual name.

40:02.000 --> 40:07.000
I think Retrocade or Classics Live sound a lot more realistic.

40:07.000 --> 40:15.000
Anyhow, they are saying that this is something that I guess looks a lot like PlayStation Home,

40:15.000 --> 40:17.000
but they're not calling it PlayStation Home.

40:17.000 --> 40:20.000
It's just something where the 360 avatars are in there,

40:20.000 --> 40:27.000
and they're kind of walking around, and they're playing arcade games.

40:27.000 --> 40:29.000
That's all we really know based on the survey.

40:29.000 --> 40:31.000
We don't know to the full extent what the interactivity is here.

40:31.000 --> 40:33.000
But you look at one of these screenshots,

40:33.000 --> 40:36.000
and you can see two levels of video games with the avatars around.

40:36.000 --> 40:38.000
And when I look at the titles of the games,

40:38.000 --> 40:40.000
they look like they might actually be old-school games.

40:40.000 --> 40:44.000
That little graphic there, that's an Intellivision graphic.

40:44.000 --> 40:47.000
That little guy there is from the Intellivision series.

40:47.000 --> 40:51.000
And it looks like the name of the game there is baseball from Intellivision.

40:51.000 --> 40:53.000
Yeah, it has the Atari logos.

40:53.000 --> 40:55.000
So I don't know what the deal is going on here.

40:55.000 --> 40:57.000
Maybe this is like old-school 80s games,

40:57.000 --> 40:59.000
Atari and Intellivision coming out, or what it is.

40:59.000 --> 41:02.000
But it could be interesting.

41:02.000 --> 41:06.000
I don't know, what would you guys like to see in regards to retro-ness on the 360?

41:06.000 --> 41:08.000
I think it would be cool to have something like that.

41:08.000 --> 41:10.000
Or that would be even kind of cool instead of like home.

41:10.000 --> 41:15.000
You can just go walk around and play arcade games.

41:15.000 --> 41:20.000
Instead of watching Twilight trailers.

41:20.000 --> 41:21.000
Right.

41:21.000 --> 41:23.000
But yeah, I've got to say though,

41:23.000 --> 41:27.000
doing this in home, going into a virtual space to launch a game,

41:27.000 --> 41:28.000
isn't that exciting?

41:28.000 --> 41:31.000
Like it's one of those things that seems a lot cooler when you hear about it.

41:31.000 --> 41:33.000
It's kind of irritating, isn't it?

41:33.000 --> 41:36.000
Yeah, so I've got to wonder, what is going to make this cool?

41:36.000 --> 41:40.000
Why am I going to want to go into this little front end with all the little avatars?

41:40.000 --> 41:43.000
Beer would make it cool.

41:43.000 --> 41:45.000
Achievement points.

41:45.000 --> 41:47.000
Oh Lord.

41:47.000 --> 41:49.000
You have found a game! Achievement point!

41:49.000 --> 41:52.000
You have sneezed, achievement point.

41:52.000 --> 41:54.000
Sadly, you're probably right.

41:54.000 --> 41:56.000
No! Hey, I got an idea.

41:56.000 --> 42:00.000
Well, it wouldn't really work with the classic games so much,

42:00.000 --> 42:03.000
but like you could have, you know, say,

42:03.000 --> 42:06.000
redemption games and you earn tickets or whatever

42:06.000 --> 42:10.000
and you can redeem stuff for your avatar like costumes and crap.

42:10.000 --> 42:13.000
What if, you might be onto something here,

42:13.000 --> 42:18.000
what if Xbox Live charged you like ten cents to play

42:18.000 --> 42:22.000
for one play of these games that might redeem?

42:22.000 --> 42:24.000
You know, because there was other news this week,

42:24.000 --> 42:26.000
and I know Bobby talked about it on his show,

42:26.000 --> 42:27.000
it didn't make the cut for our show,

42:27.000 --> 42:30.000
but they talked about the sports jerseys.

42:30.000 --> 42:32.000
I know he talked about it on his show.

42:32.000 --> 42:34.000
The sports jerseys made their way to Xbox Live this week.

42:34.000 --> 42:36.000
What, four bucks a pop for the jerseys?

42:36.000 --> 42:38.000
And I know he was surveying his listeners tonight about,

42:38.000 --> 42:42.000
you know, would they pay for that or not?

42:42.000 --> 42:46.000
Do you think there would be any interest in putting in like ten cents,

42:46.000 --> 42:50.000
twenty-five cents to play a game and possibly unlock something from the game?

42:50.000 --> 42:51.000
Do you think people would do that?

42:51.000 --> 42:53.000
I think people would bite at that, you know,

42:53.000 --> 42:55.000
like eight points or something like that.

42:55.000 --> 42:57.000
Because they've talked about this as a distribution method

42:57.000 --> 42:59.000
for games before for the online games,

42:59.000 --> 43:02.000
both PSN and Xbox Live, is they put in a quarter to play the game

43:02.000 --> 43:05.000
and then that way you're not paying like five bucks to own it

43:05.000 --> 43:07.000
if you're only going to play it once or twice.

43:07.000 --> 43:10.000
Is your mic on?

43:10.000 --> 43:11.000
No, it is now.

43:11.000 --> 43:12.000
There it is.

43:12.000 --> 43:13.000
There's consumer wars out there.

43:13.000 --> 43:15.000
I would try it just to try it.

43:15.000 --> 43:19.000
I think that a quarter would be, well,

43:19.000 --> 43:24.000
I think that it should be along the lines of, oh, play this,

43:24.000 --> 43:29.000
and if you decide that you want it permanently then, you know,

43:29.000 --> 43:30.000
like pay for demo.

43:30.000 --> 43:34.000
Well, either way, you know it's going to be their virtual money anyway.

43:34.000 --> 43:35.000
Yeah.

43:35.000 --> 43:38.000
So, all right.

43:38.000 --> 43:41.000
Well, anyhow, it's going to be interesting to see what comes of that.

43:41.000 --> 43:42.000
Of course, it could be nothing.

43:42.000 --> 43:43.000
It could just be a survey.

43:43.000 --> 43:44.000
We'll see.

43:44.000 --> 43:47.000
DarkSakura.

43:47.000 --> 43:52.000
Well, for other, I guess we can sort of call this nostalgic

43:52.000 --> 43:55.000
even though it's an ongoing series,

43:55.000 --> 43:59.000
but there's the pop music portable

43:59.000 --> 44:02.000
that's supposed to be coming out on PSP

44:02.000 --> 44:04.000
with the nine button mode and everything,

44:04.000 --> 44:08.000
but it looks like there's going to be a story mode in it.

44:08.000 --> 44:13.000
And so, because you can go around like sort of a board game map thingy

44:13.000 --> 44:19.000
like Mario Party-ish, and you go that way to unlock new songs and things,

44:19.000 --> 44:23.000
but this sort of makes me think of, like, you know the pop music,

44:23.000 --> 44:28.000
I have pop music seven where you play through

44:28.000 --> 44:32.000
as the little superhero guy at the end of the thing like a board game

44:32.000 --> 44:33.000
and you unlock stuff.

44:33.000 --> 44:35.000
It's more like an old RPG,

44:35.000 --> 44:40.000
but maybe that's just the post game unlock mode thing.

44:40.000 --> 44:42.000
I don't know if it's an actual story mode.

44:42.000 --> 44:45.000
Now, for those who don't know what pop music is,

44:45.000 --> 44:48.000
because not everybody who listens to our show now is a music game fan,

44:48.000 --> 44:51.000
it's basically think like, I guess you could say,

44:51.000 --> 44:53.000
a guitar hero or a rock band,

44:53.000 --> 44:57.000
but with a controller that looks like nine pop-o-matic bubbles

44:57.000 --> 44:58.000
from the game Trouble,

44:58.000 --> 45:01.000
and they're kind of laid out in a five on the bottom,

45:01.000 --> 45:03.000
four on the top pattern,

45:03.000 --> 45:07.000
and you use these to play songs like a la Guitar Hero, basically.

45:07.000 --> 45:10.000
How in the hell is this going to translate to PSP?

45:10.000 --> 45:13.000
Maybe they'll have an add-on or something?

45:13.000 --> 45:15.000
Japan's kind of used to this, though.

45:15.000 --> 45:17.000
Japan kind of will play these games.

45:17.000 --> 45:19.000
You've seen DDR on the Game Boy.

45:19.000 --> 45:21.000
They have DJ Max on there.

45:21.000 --> 45:24.000
Yeah, DJ Max is really popular on PSP and other countries.

45:24.000 --> 45:27.000
Even here, to some extent, has a cult following here.

45:27.000 --> 45:31.000
I guess these type of button beat games are okay.

45:31.000 --> 45:33.000
Would this game ever come out in the US, though?

45:33.000 --> 45:34.000
I don't know.

45:34.000 --> 45:37.000
How desperate is Konami for money? That's really the question.

45:37.000 --> 45:40.000
You would think, though, now that it's all going digital distribution,

45:40.000 --> 45:44.000
how hard would it be for them to just slap it up on the download and let it be?

45:44.000 --> 45:46.000
Minimal localization for that.

45:46.000 --> 45:49.000
Right, but do you think they'll still do it? Probably not.

45:49.000 --> 45:50.000
No, they're leaving.

45:50.000 --> 45:51.000
Sad.

45:51.000 --> 45:52.000
Unfortunately.

45:52.000 --> 45:53.000
Anyway.

45:53.000 --> 45:57.000
All right, well, I guess we'll see if a controller comes out for this game or not,

45:57.000 --> 45:58.000
but probably not.

45:58.000 --> 46:01.000
But the story modes, hey, this game already sounds better than pop-o-music.

46:01.000 --> 46:03.000
We are getting that here in America.

46:03.000 --> 46:10.000
And it's already better than whatever beaten groovy told you we started.

46:10.000 --> 46:13.000
Anyways, DJ Hero will be coming out in a couple weeks,

46:13.000 --> 46:18.000
and the full song list has been released by Activision

46:18.000 --> 46:24.000
and features 93 tracks with 100 different songs composing those tracks.

46:24.000 --> 46:26.000
And some of the neat little things I thought I'd mention,

46:26.000 --> 46:32.000
some of the tracks that we have here that I thought were interesting.

46:32.000 --> 46:33.000
Let's see.

46:33.000 --> 46:35.000
Of course, you may remember the remix that I did,

46:35.000 --> 46:38.000
Shout vs. Eric Pride's Piano.

46:38.000 --> 46:42.000
Well, there's also going to be two other Shout remixes as well.

46:42.000 --> 46:47.000
Tears for Fears Shout vs. DJ Shadow's 6 Days remix featuring Mos Def

46:47.000 --> 46:50.000
and Shout vs. Eric B and Rakim.

46:50.000 --> 46:52.000
Eric B is the president.

46:52.000 --> 46:58.000
That one is mixed by DJ Jazzy Jeff, all completely different sounding.

46:58.000 --> 47:00.000
They have another one also versus piano,

47:00.000 --> 47:03.000
Somebody Told Me by The Killers vs. Piano, which will be interesting.

47:03.000 --> 47:07.000
Vanilla Ice Ice Ice Baby vs. MC Hammer You Can't Touch This.

47:07.000 --> 47:13.000
And then also a little bit more 80's or I guess early 90's music in there.

47:13.000 --> 47:19.000
Ice Ice Baby vs. Paula Abdul's Straight Up, which that would be kind of interesting.

47:19.000 --> 47:24.000
If that's not your kind of thing, there may be some Herbie Hancock Rocket.

47:24.000 --> 47:28.000
They've got a beat juggle version of that and also Rocket vs. Nerd's Lap Dance.

47:28.000 --> 47:32.000
That one's produced by Grandmaster Flash.

47:32.000 --> 47:40.000
And then Foreigner, Jukebox Hero vs. DJ Z-Trip featuring Mers, DJ Hero.

47:40.000 --> 47:46.000
That's produced and mixed by DJ Z-Trip.

47:46.000 --> 47:49.000
And then some of the songs that we'll be hearing tonight later on.

47:49.000 --> 47:55.000
Foreigner, Jukebox Hero, only live for our live listeners during break.

47:55.000 --> 47:59.000
Foo Fighters Monkey Wrench vs. BC Boys Sabotage, the DJ guitar mix.

47:59.000 --> 48:04.000
And then also, what do we got here?

48:04.000 --> 48:14.000
Boom Boom Pow by Black Eyed Peas and Satisfaction by Benny Banasi.

48:14.000 --> 48:17.000
And lots more stuff.

48:17.000 --> 48:20.000
But yeah, you can check out the full track list. It's online everywhere.

48:20.000 --> 48:24.000
Lots of good songs. I'm very excited to play all these.

48:24.000 --> 48:28.000
Now we're actually going to give DJ Hero a little spin here in studio quick.

48:28.000 --> 48:31.000
I don't think we're going to play all the songs because of copyright.

48:31.000 --> 48:33.000
We'll just play like maybe a minute or so.

48:33.000 --> 48:35.000
But just if you kind of want to hear what this game sounds like.

48:35.000 --> 48:38.000
And it's going to be tricky because I kind of want Loki to describe what...

48:38.000 --> 48:40.000
Or I guess maybe I'll describe kind of what he's doing.

48:40.000 --> 48:45.000
This is going to be weird radio, but can we plug in DJ Hero and get some of the noise out on the feed here?

48:45.000 --> 48:48.000
And I'm going to kind of describe what Loki's doing as he's playing this game.

48:48.000 --> 48:52.000
Where are the audio ties? Oh, they're down there. Are those them?

48:52.000 --> 48:55.000
Or is that where they're... Okay.

48:55.000 --> 49:01.000
Hold on guys. Live radio. We're actually plugging in the audio for DJ Hero right now.

49:01.000 --> 49:06.000
Can you shut it down a little bit?

49:14.000 --> 49:17.000
Okay. Did that take down my mics too?

49:17.000 --> 49:22.000
Okay. Sorry guys. We're adjusting the audio live here.

49:22.000 --> 49:25.000
So, alright.

49:25.000 --> 49:29.000
So here we go. So Loki's going to hit start.

49:29.000 --> 49:34.000
I don't hear anything either.

49:34.000 --> 49:40.000
Oh, there it is. Very quiet. There we go.

49:40.000 --> 49:44.000
Sorry guys. I know this isn't the most interesting radio in the world, but right now there's a menu here.

49:44.000 --> 49:48.000
Learn to DJ. Quick play single DJ. That's what Loki picked.

49:48.000 --> 49:51.000
And in this demo we have Marvin Gaye versus Gorillaz.

49:51.000 --> 49:56.000
Gwen Stefani versus Rick James and Black Eyed Peas versus Benny Banasi.

49:56.000 --> 50:01.000
And you can actually see it shows you on the screen who is presenting the track.

50:01.000 --> 50:06.000
It shows what's called the intensity, which this is low.

50:06.000 --> 50:11.000
And the duration, 3 minutes and 48 seconds for the song that Loki currently has selected.

50:11.000 --> 50:14.000
And then you can actually see performance on different levels.

50:14.000 --> 50:19.000
I don't know if that shows how well Loki's done or what that is showing there.

50:19.000 --> 50:24.000
Do we have the audio?

50:27.000 --> 50:30.000
Is the connection bad?

50:30.000 --> 50:34.000
There you go.

50:34.000 --> 50:44.000
I think those wires are weird.

50:44.000 --> 50:49.000
Uh oh, is there a mixing board? That's not good.

50:49.000 --> 50:54.000
Sorry guys.

50:54.000 --> 50:59.000
The reason why you're hearing it bounce from left to right, those of you listening live, are podcasts are mono.

50:59.000 --> 51:06.000
Loki's doing one at a time here.

51:06.000 --> 51:09.000
We're having the board just to match it. There you go.

51:09.000 --> 51:16.000
Don't touch it. Just play.

51:16.000 --> 51:18.000
Did the audio already go out?

51:18.000 --> 51:20.000
Oh crap.

51:20.000 --> 51:23.000
All right. Well, maybe we won't get to play it live tonight.

51:23.000 --> 51:26.000
We will later. You're going to fix it for later.

51:26.000 --> 51:30.000
All right. So we just won't get to play it during the show for the podcasters. That was a waste of time.

51:30.000 --> 51:32.000
Sorry guys.

51:32.000 --> 51:34.000
Are you working on that now?

51:34.000 --> 51:38.000
All right. All right. Fair enough.

51:38.000 --> 51:41.000
I don't know what to talk about here in the meantime.

51:41.000 --> 51:44.000
Should I just go on to the next story? We'll come back.

51:44.000 --> 51:48.000
Yeah, we'll do that. I'm going to go on to the next story. We'll come back.

51:48.000 --> 51:51.000
The next story has to do with the Wii Balance Board.

51:51.000 --> 51:56.000
The Wii Balance Board apparently is now being used in some airport screening.

51:56.000 --> 52:00.000
Now, this is only a study. It's not actually something you're going to go to the airport and see right now.

52:00.000 --> 52:09.000
But apparently, the US government has invested some money into actually looking at using the Wii Balance Board in airport screening.

52:09.000 --> 52:12.000
So this is according to a CNN report.

52:12.000 --> 52:18.000
This is a couple of experimental methods that are being used right now to see who is suspicious at the airport.

52:18.000 --> 52:24.000
This is being done by scientists that are part of the Future Attribute Screening Technology, or FAST program.

52:24.000 --> 52:29.000
They're actually using the Wii Fit peripheral to see how somebody shifts their weight.

52:29.000 --> 52:35.000
They're trying to find, quote, a level of fidgeting that would suggest the need for a secondary screening.

52:35.000 --> 52:40.000
So they're using the Wii Balance Board, I guess it's something that you would kind of step on before you go through the gate,

52:40.000 --> 52:45.000
to see if you are really fidgety while you're going into the airport.

52:45.000 --> 52:50.000
That's kind of weird to me because what if you're just old and you just shake a lot?

52:50.000 --> 52:53.000
I mean, wouldn't that set off some red flags?

52:53.000 --> 52:58.000
I don't know about you guys, but I don't think this is something you're actually going to see at an airport for quite some time.

52:58.000 --> 53:02.000
You certainly wouldn't see a Wii Balance Board, that's for sure.

53:02.000 --> 53:08.000
Would you see that type of technology embedded into a mat that you step on before you go through the terminal?

53:08.000 --> 53:12.000
Sure. But are you going to see the Wii Balance Board itself out there?

53:12.000 --> 53:16.000
Heck no. That's just going to look dumb. Besides, those things are kind of thin.

53:16.000 --> 53:21.000
And don't forget the Wii Balance Board only supports up to like 300 or 350 pounds.

53:21.000 --> 53:24.000
That doesn't include everybody that you need to screen at an airport.

53:24.000 --> 53:32.000
So if anything else, they may have to take the same technology and use it in some other new device.

53:32.000 --> 53:36.000
Although I don't know why seeing the balance of somebody is going to show if they're a terrorist or not.

53:36.000 --> 53:38.000
That seems a little silly to me.

53:38.000 --> 53:45.000
I have this bad feeling that this whole thing was just a footnote on some other study that people are taking way too seriously.

53:45.000 --> 53:49.000
Yeah, an X-Link in chat says, old person with MS, Suez Airport.

53:49.000 --> 53:52.000
Yeah, I can see that. I can see that happening.

53:52.000 --> 53:58.000
How we doing, Loki? We okay? Loki's got some new plugs he's going to try.

53:58.000 --> 54:01.000
Like I said, I want to try this the first time.

54:01.000 --> 54:04.000
This is the way he wanted to do it the first time, I guess.

54:04.000 --> 54:06.000
Of course, I'm not hearing anything.

54:06.000 --> 54:10.000
Oh.

54:10.000 --> 54:17.000
It's those plugs there are bad.

54:17.000 --> 54:25.000
Do you have another red and white set you can use besides those plugs?

54:25.000 --> 54:28.000
Only on live radio could this happen, boys and girls.

54:28.000 --> 54:32.000
What about the gray cords? There's gray cords in the box that we used to use.

54:32.000 --> 54:38.000
Those will extend.

54:38.000 --> 54:44.000
Okay, we're trying to right now extend.

54:44.000 --> 54:49.000
Will that even work? Okay, he says yes.

54:49.000 --> 54:52.000
And hopefully these plugs will be a little better.

54:52.000 --> 54:55.000
And that's what Loki is putting in right now.

54:55.000 --> 54:59.000
As we try to demo DJ Hero for you guys here on Orange Lodge Radio.

54:59.000 --> 55:02.000
Much better.

55:02.000 --> 55:06.000
Alright.

55:06.000 --> 55:09.000
Okay.

55:09.000 --> 55:12.000
So which track are you going to play here?

55:12.000 --> 55:18.000
Oh yeah, I'm going to get one. Here we go.

55:18.000 --> 55:21.000
So he can pick his character here if he wants, but he didn't.

55:21.000 --> 55:26.000
So now he's cool Papa G is the character he is.

55:26.000 --> 55:29.000
There's also one named Kitty Smash.

55:29.000 --> 55:31.000
It's like a punk chick.

55:31.000 --> 55:32.000
So alright.

55:32.000 --> 55:34.000
So he's going to go cool Papa G.

55:34.000 --> 55:36.000
And now he's picking his difficulty.

55:36.000 --> 55:38.000
He's going with medium.

55:38.000 --> 55:41.000
Sorry.

55:41.000 --> 55:44.000
Alright, so the song is currently loading.

55:44.000 --> 55:46.000
And there's a tip on the screen.

55:46.000 --> 55:48.000
Rewinds are a great way to earn a big score.

55:48.000 --> 55:51.000
Try them in a section you know well.

55:51.000 --> 55:53.000
And it's showing him a little bit about how to play the game.

55:53.000 --> 55:56.000
There's a euphoria button, an effects dial.

55:56.000 --> 56:01.000
Alright, so this is Marvin Gaye versus Gorillaz.

56:01.000 --> 56:03.000
He's laying down the track.

56:03.000 --> 56:06.000
Here we go.

56:06.000 --> 56:18.000
And right now he's hitting buttons on the controller in time with the beats as they fall.

56:18.000 --> 56:25.000
He's also moving the crossfader back and forth as you see it on the green and the blue sides.

56:25.000 --> 56:29.000
I don't know if he's holding the button down when he does that.

56:29.000 --> 56:33.000
And when he sees these little arrows on the track, he actually has to keep scratching.

56:33.000 --> 56:47.000
Let's just check some there.

56:47.000 --> 56:49.000
I want this remix really bad.

56:49.000 --> 56:54.000
And Logan's actually having to hold down the green or the blue button when he scratches.

56:54.000 --> 57:20.000
Because they're scratching on both the green and the blue track.

57:20.000 --> 57:32.000
What was that in the middle? He just blared a horn.

57:32.000 --> 57:33.000
Very interesting.

57:33.000 --> 57:35.000
Alright, I don't know if we can play much more here.

57:35.000 --> 57:37.000
I'm going to cut you off, Logan.

57:37.000 --> 57:39.000
Can you just pause it?

57:39.000 --> 57:42.000
Or fail it or whatever?

57:42.000 --> 57:43.000
Alright, there he is. He's going to pause it there.

57:43.000 --> 57:46.000
You will get to hear the whole thing of that on break later.

57:46.000 --> 57:50.000
But unfortunately for the podcast, we have to cut it off because we don't want to get sued by the makers of DJ Hero.

57:50.000 --> 57:54.000
So we used a little bit there for critical review purposes only.

57:54.000 --> 57:55.000
As we're allowed to do.

57:55.000 --> 57:58.000
So, there you go.

57:58.000 --> 57:59.000
Interesting.

57:59.000 --> 58:01.000
Yeah, it is a bummer we don't have TV.

58:01.000 --> 58:05.000
I don't know what exciting radio that made, but at least I was able to get a feel for the game.

58:05.000 --> 58:07.000
Now I kind of want to play.

58:07.000 --> 58:08.000
Yeah, it looks like fun.

58:08.000 --> 58:09.000
I'll have to play later.

58:09.000 --> 58:10.000
Alright.

58:10.000 --> 58:14.000
Anyhow, we'll get into more DJ Hero here in a little bit, but we have some more news.

58:14.000 --> 58:16.000
Dark Soccer is going to take us to our next story.

58:16.000 --> 58:19.000
I am. Well, I guess I am.

58:19.000 --> 58:25.000
For fans of Beatles Rock Band, there is an actual download content plan in store.

58:25.000 --> 58:31.000
But it's based on how well the next three sets of download content go.

58:31.000 --> 58:42.000
Because the process for doing everything for Beatles Rock Band is expensive and intensive.

58:42.000 --> 58:47.000
Because it's not just like, you know, mastering one song in.

58:47.000 --> 58:57.000
You have to send off the original tape and redo it and bring it back in and have level animation and whatnot ready for it.

58:57.000 --> 59:01.000
Because it has to fit in with their whole, I guess, branding or whatever.

59:01.000 --> 59:03.000
The feel of the game.

59:03.000 --> 59:06.000
It has to fit the identity of the game.

59:06.000 --> 59:11.000
So, they want to see how everything sells first.

59:11.000 --> 59:17.000
Right now, of course, the only downloadable content is All You Need Is Love.

59:17.000 --> 59:26.000
But on October 20th, we're getting Abbey Road, which will be 1360 Microsoft Points.

59:26.000 --> 59:28.000
Or 160 points per track.

59:28.000 --> 59:33.000
And then we get Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band and Rubber Soul, which Rubber Soul is my favorite.

59:33.000 --> 59:34.000
Just saying.

59:34.000 --> 59:36.000
Great album.

59:36.000 --> 59:39.000
I had it on vinyl.

59:39.000 --> 59:45.000
And, of course, those are coming out in November and December, respectively.

59:45.000 --> 59:47.000
So, I think it makes sense.

59:47.000 --> 59:53.000
Because it is really a lot of work that goes into it.

59:53.000 --> 59:59.000
Not just for having to master the tracks, but like I said, you've got to make sure that the animation is lined up.

59:59.000 --> 01:00:03.000
That everything is going to fit the feel of the rest of the game.

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:08.000
Which is why you can't go in and play Aerosmith on Beatles Rock Band or something like that.

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:10.000
Even though that would be kind of fun.

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:12.000
That would be in Guitar Hero.

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:14.000
You know what I mean, as an example.

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:19.000
Well, you can't expect that there's going to be new content every week for the Beatles Rock Band.

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:22.000
Obviously, there's a very limited catalog to what they can pick from.

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:24.000
And, of course, you're talking about old music.

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:33.000
You're talking about very protected, very delicate, world icon music that has got to be scrutinized very carefully.

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:37.000
It makes sense why this is not going to be a floodgate worth of material.

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:45.000
If the game enough isn't enough for you, I don't think the download content is going to give you anything that's going to make you go, OMG must buy this game.

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:48.000
If the game enough wasn't good enough, forget it.

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:51.000
But it would be nice to see them pour some more stuff out here.

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:59.000
My thought on this is that there are actually a number of songs in the home game that are just a few that I'm really not familiar with.

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:07.000
And certain songs in different eras are ones that are not on my list of old favorites.

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:11.000
I like a lot of the mid to older stuff better.

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:16.000
But isn't it like maybe exposing you to stuff you haven't heard from a band that is so iconic?

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:17.000
I'll put it this way.

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:22.000
I've at least heard most of the songs in the game once at least.

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:28.000
But I don't really look at it as being a new kind of exposure.

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:32.000
It's just that I would rather have some of my favorites.

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:41.000
Although I wonder how they're doing some of the ones that didn't have a drum track or didn't have any guitar.

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:46.000
For example, Eleanor Rigby only had strings.

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:51.000
So maybe you put your guitar up to your neck and play as a violin.

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:52.000
I'm joking.

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:59.000
You could probably play a sort of like a Let's Talk More Rock instead of Keytar.

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:02.000
You have, you know.

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:04.000
Violin Rock.

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:05.000
Vanessa May.

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:11.000
Anyhow, let's go ahead and get into some release dates for games that are coming out this week.

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:15.000
Yeah, I got a good selection of games coming out this week.

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:21.000
Starting things off, Witch's Tale, which is going to be coming out on DS.

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:25.000
Also this week, NBA 2K10 is coming out on PC.

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:27.000
I guess it got delayed from the rest of them.

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:32.000
Kars Racerama pretty much coming out on everything.

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:34.000
Squeeballs Party on the Wii and DS.

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:39.000
You may remember this was the game that was supposed to have a Wii remote type of controller for the Xbox 360.

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:41.000
That version got cancelled, unfortunately.

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:44.000
But you can pick it up on the rest of the systems.

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:51.000
Also, kind of a Grey's Hits edition of Midnight Club Los Angeles is coming out.

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:56.000
The Complete Edition with the download content intact and for the Grey's Hits price.

01:02:56.000 --> 01:03:00.000
Pets Pony Beauty Pageant for the DS.

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:04.000
Sing Star Latino coming out on PlayStation 2.

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:05.000
That's interesting.

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:06.000
Didn't know that was coming over here.

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:11.000
Ju-On, The Grudge, Haunted House Simulator for the Wii.

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:13.000
Making its way out this week.

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:21.000
Africa on PS3, which apparently has been getting horrible reviews.

01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:23.000
It's about time that game comes out, though.

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:24.000
Africa.

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:25.000
Yes.

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:32.000
Where the Wild Things are coming out, tying with the new movie.

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:36.000
That'll be on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Wii, and DS.

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:38.000
Maybe PSP.

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:42.000
Magna Carta 2 coming out on Xbox 360.

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:45.000
Sing Star Motown coming out on PlayStation 3.

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:47.000
Also another game I was unaware of.

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:54.000
Heroes Saga Leviathan Tactics coming out on DS.

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:59.000
Mario and Sonic at the Olympic Winter Games on the Wii and DS this week.

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:04.000
Brutal Legend making its way out on Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3.

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:06.000
Kind of go along with Epic Games like that.

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:10.000
Uncharted 2 Among Thieves coming out this week on PlayStation 3.

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:13.000
Half Minute Hero coming out on PlayStation Portable.

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:15.000
That'll be pretty awesome.

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:16.000
They haven't bought Fallout 3 yet.

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:22.000
Fallout 3 Game of the Year Edition with all the download content with it for 60 bucks.

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:25.000
That's coming out on Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, and PC.

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:29.000
Way of the Samurai on Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 this week.

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:34.000
Grand Theft Auto Chinatown Wars on PSP.

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:38.000
Sudoku Ball Detective on the Wii.

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:40.000
Buck Fever on the Wii.

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:45.000
And a boy and his blob on the Wii.

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:46.000
That's going to be awesome.

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:47.000
Really?

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:48.000
Yeah.

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:49.000
Boy, that came out under the radar, didn't it?

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:52.000
I actually saw something for that a little earlier today.

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:56.000
I thought I'd seen something on one of the blogs, but I got the impression this game was still in development.

01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:58.000
I didn't realize it was coming out now.

01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:00.000
It's ready to go.

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:01.000
Interesting.

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:05.000
Agatha Christie's ABC Murders coming out on DS this week.

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:06.000
Woohoo.

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:07.000
Yeah.

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:10.000
Hope Angela Lansbury does some voice acting in that.

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:12.000
I'm a big fan.

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:13.000
And that's it.

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:14.000
All right.

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:16.000
Japanese release dates are not here this week.

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:18.000
We'll get back to those next week.

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:23.000
So apologies to those folks looking for the releases in Japan, but my resource is not working right now.

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:26.000
So we'll have to just skip over to Euro release dates, right, Jimmy?

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:32.000
Well, what we have is Brutal Legend on the 16th for PS3 and Xbox 360.

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:35.000
Harvest Fishing, yay.

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:41.000
Magna Carta 2, Mario and Luigi Bowser's Inside Story, which actually that sounds pretty fun to me.

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:45.000
Playing as a big old lizard guy.

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:47.000
Playing inside of him.

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:48.000
Yeah.

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:50.000
The nose and rump command.

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:52.000
That sounds funny.

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:56.000
Mario and Sonic at the Olympic Winter Games on the 16th.

01:05:56.000 --> 01:06:02.000
And Ninja Captains, as well as Tropico 3.

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:07.000
Oh, and also Uncharted 2 among thieves.

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:10.000
That we all are.

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:12.000
I'm hearing great things about Uncharted 2.

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:14.000
I just want to say great, great things.

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:15.000
Uncharted.

01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:17.000
I want to kind of check it out.

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:18.000
This looks...

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:24.000
I'm looking at more of the stuff from the Mario and Luigi Bowser's Inside Story.

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:26.000
That actually looks pretty cute.

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:28.000
Well, those Mario and Luigi games were always fun.

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:30.000
I feel like they've kind of like really milked that series.

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:34.000
But, you know, they've always been a good kind of role playing game for the DS.

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:37.000
Yeah.

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:41.000
Okay, so you may not be having trouble with your vision.

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:44.000
But hey, who says that you can't improve upon what you already have?

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:49.000
And apparently a company that makes gaming glasses is looking to do that.

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:52.000
The new glasses are called Gunner Optics.

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:55.000
And they're designed to improve your gaming performance.

01:06:55.000 --> 01:07:01.000
Apparently they have some special coating and tints to them.

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:07.000
And apparently they do everything from reducing glare to blocking out evaporative air currents.

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:09.000
Okay.

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:12.000
Basically, to me, they look like shooting glasses.

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:14.000
But just with a fancier frame.

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:16.000
They kind of have that same yellow tint to them.

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:17.000
The prices are $100.

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:20.000
And apparently Ars Technica took them out for a test drive.

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:23.000
And actually found out that they do what they say.

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:27.000
And actually did have an effect during prolonged gaming sessions.

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:31.000
Whether that's worth the $100 or not is, I guess, your decision.

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:33.000
But they look neat.

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:36.000
You know, I guess a little bit geek chic.

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:37.000
I don't know.

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:40.000
Maybe if I, I don't know, that might look good in glasses.

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:43.000
I'm not going to drop $100 on glasses, though.

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:44.000
Let me see these.

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:48.000
Well, you know, a good pair of regular glasses will cost you several hundred dollars.

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:49.000
So, you know.

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:51.000
Mine cost $430.

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:53.000
That's why people have vision insurance, but.

01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:58.000
And if it's just yellow tint, I have yellow tinted glasses I bought for $10 that are basically

01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:01.000
this same thing, except without the fancy frame.

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:04.000
And, you know, maybe I should try those.

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:06.000
Except I don't like running around with those, because.

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:09.000
Well, didn't some big website put this on a study and vouch for it?

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:10.000
I mean, so.

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:11.000
Yeah.

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:12.000
There's got to be something more there, Loki.

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:15.000
I don't think this is something you can just get the tinted lens at the 98 cent clearance

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:17.000
center and run with, you know.

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:20.000
Well, not necessarily those, but like, you know, shooting glasses.

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:27.000
I bought them for Airsofting, but they're dangerous to wear Airsofting, because, you

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:31.000
know, those BBs can bounce underneath them, and that's not good, so you need like full

01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:32.000
face goggles.

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:36.000
But I did buy them, and they worked okay, you know, because they didn't fog up, and

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:37.000
that was positive to me.

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:42.000
But after wearing them for an extended period of time, your eyes kind of hurt because everything's

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:45.000
like a yellow tint, and you take them off, and you're like, what?

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:46.000
Colors other than yellow.

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:48.000
What the hell?

01:08:48.000 --> 01:09:12.620
Well, according to Tiger Claw in our chat room, chat.orange

01:09:12.620 --> 01:09:16.620
on twitter.com, apparently Dead Pixel Live, another show here on allgames.com, had an

01:09:16.620 --> 01:09:18.120
awesome day.

01:09:18.120 --> 01:09:19.120
Alright, anyhow.

01:09:19.120 --> 01:09:22.620
Moving on to one more game news story here, and then we're getting to the classic game

01:09:22.620 --> 01:09:24.620
of the week.

01:09:24.620 --> 01:09:27.080
PSP Minis.

01:09:27.080 --> 01:09:28.940
You know, these are coming out now.

01:09:28.940 --> 01:09:33.380
You saw kind of the first wave of these hit when the PSP Go came out, but something that

01:09:33.380 --> 01:09:40.000
PSP Minis are having to account for in their price point, the ESRB ratings apparently are

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:43.860
setting these developers back $2,500.

01:09:43.860 --> 01:09:49.000
So you might see a game here on a PSP that you see on the iPhone as well, and it costs

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:52.720
more on the PSP, and the whole reason why is the ESRB.

01:09:52.720 --> 01:09:58.320
And something I didn't think of before is that the ESRB, you don't have to get a rating

01:09:58.320 --> 01:10:01.720
from that for the iPhone game, surprisingly enough.

01:10:01.720 --> 01:10:04.800
Isn't that something you think that's going to come to a head later on?

01:10:04.800 --> 01:10:08.040
Like isn't that just a bag of uh-oh waiting to be open?

01:10:08.040 --> 01:10:12.560
No, not really, because if you think about it, they kind of go through their own review

01:10:12.560 --> 01:10:18.600
process through Apple, and really it's Apple as a platform that determines whether they

01:10:18.600 --> 01:10:22.380
want to put games on their platform that have an ESRB rating or not.

01:10:22.380 --> 01:10:26.800
And if they say, yeah, we'll take whatever, even if it doesn't have a rating or not, then

01:10:26.800 --> 01:10:29.880
there's really nothing the ESRB can do.

01:10:29.880 --> 01:10:34.200
Although it should be noted the ESRB is the president, I'm sorry, I do want to mention

01:10:34.200 --> 01:10:38.360
this, the president has been on record saying not that long ago that Apple should be going

01:10:38.360 --> 01:10:39.640
to their rating system for the iPhone.

01:10:39.640 --> 01:10:41.560
Well, of course, they want the $2,500.

01:10:41.560 --> 01:10:45.680
They want money for all those ratings and stuff, but you know what, if they don't want

01:10:45.680 --> 01:10:50.800
to do it, and they don't have to do it, so to hell with you.

01:10:50.800 --> 01:10:55.320
Interesting point from xlink in chat, kids don't have an iPhone, adults do.

01:10:55.320 --> 01:10:56.320
But what about-

01:10:56.320 --> 01:10:57.320
I know kids with iPhones.

01:10:57.320 --> 01:10:58.320
Yeah.

01:10:58.320 --> 01:10:59.320
What the hell are you talking about?

01:10:59.320 --> 01:11:00.320
What about an iTouch, too?

01:11:00.320 --> 01:11:02.640
I mean, he makes a good point that an iTouch, you don't have to have a phone contract for.

01:11:02.640 --> 01:11:03.640
That sounds dirty, Rob.

01:11:03.640 --> 01:11:04.640
Well, that's true, though.

01:11:04.640 --> 01:11:05.640
The apps are for the iTouch, too.

01:11:05.640 --> 01:11:07.080
It's an iPod Touch.

01:11:07.080 --> 01:11:11.320
At least they don't have a kids version called iTouch Kids, because that would be bad.

01:11:11.320 --> 01:11:12.320
Fine.

01:11:12.320 --> 01:11:13.320
iPod Touch.

01:11:13.320 --> 01:11:14.320
Sorry.

01:11:14.320 --> 01:11:15.320
I thought it was an iTouch.

01:11:15.320 --> 01:11:16.320
Whatever.

01:11:16.320 --> 01:11:17.320
Shut up.

01:11:17.320 --> 01:11:18.320
All right.

01:11:18.320 --> 01:11:19.320
I got to do a story.

01:11:19.320 --> 01:11:20.320
Yes.

01:11:20.320 --> 01:11:21.320
I know.

01:11:21.320 --> 01:11:22.320
What's that?

01:11:22.320 --> 01:11:23.320
Down the line.

01:11:23.320 --> 01:11:24.320
I can't shut up yet.

01:11:24.320 --> 01:11:25.320
No.

01:11:25.320 --> 01:11:26.320
All right.

01:11:26.320 --> 01:11:30.600
Anyhow, I just wanted to say, though, real quick, that if you wonder why the PSP Minis

01:11:30.600 --> 01:11:35.020
are more expensive, that is something the developers are citing as kind of their excuse,

01:11:35.020 --> 01:11:36.200
for lack of a better term.

01:11:36.200 --> 01:11:37.560
So there you go.

01:11:37.560 --> 01:11:38.560
All right.

01:11:38.560 --> 01:11:42.280
So we're going to get into another segment we like to do here on Orange Lounge Radio.

01:11:42.280 --> 01:11:45.480
Every week is kind of our Part B segment, so to speak.

01:11:45.480 --> 01:11:49.920
And it's a part where Dark Sakura gets to climb through her gaming vault and find a

01:11:49.920 --> 01:11:53.280
game that, you know what, she thinks you guys ought to be playing.

01:11:53.280 --> 01:11:58.400
And this is a segment we like to call the Classic Video Game of the Week.

01:11:58.400 --> 01:12:04.080
Oh, Dark Sakura, what should the kids be playing this week?

01:12:04.080 --> 01:12:07.080
Well, this is a game that I have admitted to everybody.

01:12:07.080 --> 01:12:08.080
I have not played it.

01:12:08.080 --> 01:12:09.080
I have seen it.

01:12:09.080 --> 01:12:10.080
No, I take it back.

01:12:10.080 --> 01:12:11.080
I started it once.

01:12:11.080 --> 01:12:16.640
But people have suggested it to me, and earlier today, a friend of mine suggested it to me

01:12:16.640 --> 01:12:17.640
as well.

01:12:17.640 --> 01:12:19.720
Megzi suggested it.

01:12:19.720 --> 01:12:23.200
Is Super Mario RPG Legend of the Seven Stars?

01:12:23.200 --> 01:12:25.480
Well, it's about time.

01:12:25.480 --> 01:12:28.640
This is a classic game, Dark Sakura, even if you somehow missed it.

01:12:28.640 --> 01:12:30.960
This is definitely one of the all-time classic games.

01:12:30.960 --> 01:12:35.440
In fact, a game that I was surprised we have never featured here on the Classic Game of

01:12:35.440 --> 01:12:36.440
the Week segment.

01:12:36.440 --> 01:12:44.080
So, I am going to play some music from it for you right now as soon as the website cooperates,

01:12:44.080 --> 01:12:45.560
which it is not right now.

01:12:45.560 --> 01:12:48.080
I'm not doing anything extra internet-y.

01:12:48.080 --> 01:12:49.080
We may not.

01:12:49.080 --> 01:12:50.080
There we go.

01:12:50.080 --> 01:12:53.760
I just picked random level music.

01:12:53.760 --> 01:13:03.520
Anyway, Super Mario RPG is an sort of adventure and role-playing game that's put out by Square

01:13:03.520 --> 01:13:06.040
back in the day and Nintendo.

01:13:06.040 --> 01:13:12.040
It came out in Japan on March 9th, 1996, and on May 13th, 1996, in North America.

01:13:12.040 --> 01:13:14.660
Europe did not get it.

01:13:14.660 --> 01:13:21.960
Not until it came out on the Virtual Console, August 22nd, 2008, which, according to this

01:13:21.960 --> 01:13:29.120
reference, is the longest difference in time between release dates in Nintendo's history.

01:13:29.120 --> 01:13:30.120
I had to change the YouTube.

01:13:30.120 --> 01:13:34.960
Sorry, the other one wasn't loading right, so here we go.

01:13:34.960 --> 01:13:47.440
Anyway, this was made pretty much all in-house by Square with guidance from Miyamoto, so

01:13:47.440 --> 01:13:49.440
big deal.

01:13:49.440 --> 01:13:52.960
The battle system in this game was pretty cool.

01:13:52.960 --> 01:14:00.760
It's very similar to Chrono Trigger so that it's action-based, but you don't necessarily

01:14:00.760 --> 01:14:04.240
just stick in your monster battles.

01:14:04.240 --> 01:14:11.920
It does play rather isometrically, and you can see your enemies, and you can't, you know,

01:14:11.920 --> 01:14:18.880
you don't fight with one until you run into one, so that's what I mean by Chrono Trigger-like.

01:14:18.880 --> 01:14:23.320
But with your battle system, you can play Mario, Mallow, Geno, Bowser, or Princess Toadstool.

01:14:23.320 --> 01:14:30.640
They all, of course, have their own attacks, and it is turn-based, this traditional turn-based

01:14:30.640 --> 01:14:42.880
system, but you do have timed button presses, where how you do your commands determines

01:14:42.880 --> 01:14:50.160
how your results come out, so pretty cool, and of course you have items and stuff.

01:14:50.160 --> 01:14:58.480
But yeah, with the game, you go visit all the Toad people, and you have Moleville, and

01:14:58.480 --> 01:15:05.640
a monster town, and you have the Yoshi town, and you have the cloud place called Nimbus

01:15:05.640 --> 01:15:14.400
Land where the cloud people live, and Bowser's castle, and all this other crazy stuff, but

01:15:14.400 --> 01:15:19.680
you play, but yeah, there are some original characters on there, I mean, not just, you

01:15:19.680 --> 01:15:26.960
know, Mario and Toadstool and Bowser who come from the other games, but you have Mallow

01:15:26.960 --> 01:15:37.520
who is a cloud boy who thinks he's a tadpole, and Geno who is possessed by a creature from

01:15:37.520 --> 01:15:45.240
the star road, and then, of course, Bowser and his little friends, so that's the game.

01:15:45.240 --> 01:15:46.400
Pretty cool.

01:15:46.400 --> 01:15:52.800
It's got its own fun look, and its own fun music, and also though, this is, I've mentioned

01:15:52.800 --> 01:15:59.600
this before, but it's one of the only three games that came outside of Japan that used

01:15:59.600 --> 01:16:08.440
the Nintendo SA1, the others being Kirby Superstar and Kirby's Dream Land 3, so basically, and

01:16:08.440 --> 01:16:14.520
this was another microprocessor, but it had allowed a higher clock speed, faster RAM,

01:16:14.520 --> 01:16:21.440
greater memory mapping, data storage compression, new DMA modes such as bitmap to bitplane,

01:16:21.440 --> 01:16:26.400
and builds in CIC lockout, so, pretty cool.

01:16:26.400 --> 01:16:36.880
Oh yeah, it had different sound effects that used the SBC 700, so that was pretty cool.

01:16:36.880 --> 01:16:41.600
This game was really advanced for when it came out, so.

01:16:41.600 --> 01:16:44.360
Alright, well there you go.

01:16:44.360 --> 01:16:49.920
Super Mario RPG finally, after all this time, gets highlighted on our show here, although

01:16:49.920 --> 01:16:53.880
we've talked about it very fondly before, even if Dark Sakura somehow missed it.

01:16:53.880 --> 01:16:57.480
That's okay, you know what, I played it a little bit, I like rented it once, and played

01:16:57.480 --> 01:17:01.040
the crap out of it for like five days, and then, you know, sent it back, but I never

01:17:01.040 --> 01:17:02.040
beat the game.

01:17:02.040 --> 01:17:05.040
Loki, on the other hand, I know this is one of his all-time favorites, if I'm not mistaken,

01:17:05.040 --> 01:17:06.040
right?

01:17:06.040 --> 01:17:07.040
Hell yeah, I finished the game.

01:17:07.040 --> 01:17:10.400
Alright, I see some people in chat calling it a good entry-level RPG, and a lot of folks

01:17:10.400 --> 01:17:14.840
in chat really like this as the classic game of the week, so there you go.

01:17:14.840 --> 01:17:16.840
Super Mario RPG, the classic game of the week.

01:17:16.840 --> 01:17:20.440
Alright, that's gonna do it for this part A of Orange Lawns Radio tonight, but don't

01:17:20.440 --> 01:17:23.800
go anywhere, because when we come back in part B, we have your Twitter topics, some

01:17:23.800 --> 01:17:29.080
rapid-fire news tonight, and some news about Facebook and Twitter on Xbox Live, some dates

01:17:29.080 --> 01:17:33.480
for when you can expect to see that, and Rock Band, coming to the iPhone.

01:17:33.480 --> 01:17:38.600
We talked a little bit about iPhone games, now a big, big title is coming its way to

01:17:38.600 --> 01:17:42.480
the iPhone, so we'll be kind of talking about if folks are looking forward to that, or if

01:17:42.480 --> 01:17:44.020
this just sounds like shit.

01:17:44.020 --> 01:17:48.400
We'll talk about that all in a little bit when we come back with more of Orange Lounge

01:17:48.400 --> 01:17:55.720
Radio, so stay tuned.

01:17:55.720 --> 01:18:00.760
And welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio, live on this October 11th, 2009, here

01:18:00.760 --> 01:18:07.360
for episode number 340 of our weekly podcast, which we've taped since May, I'm sorry, June

01:18:07.360 --> 01:18:10.040
of 2002.

01:18:10.040 --> 01:18:13.320
During the break there, something I don't think we've done in quite some time in the

01:18:13.320 --> 01:18:18.320
history of our show, Loki actually played a game live and provided us all of the break

01:18:18.320 --> 01:18:20.560
music tonight, and we played some DJ Hero.

01:18:20.560 --> 01:18:24.560
I am so sorry to the podcast listeners, but due to copyright restrictions, we can't play

01:18:24.560 --> 01:18:28.480
any more than we did in part A for you guys, although I hear guys in our chat room were

01:18:28.480 --> 01:18:34.600
bootlegging that, and we don't condone that, but if you know who to talk to, there's really

01:18:34.600 --> 01:18:37.840
nothing we can do about it if some of those bootlegs get out, so there you go.

01:18:37.840 --> 01:18:41.520
But I posed a question to chat, what you guys thought of that, and we were talking here

01:18:41.520 --> 01:18:45.720
in the studio, the soundtrack's really hot, that third song, especially the Satisfaction

01:18:45.720 --> 01:18:51.040
versus Boom Boom Pow, the Black Eyed Peas are kind of hit and miss for me, I think they

01:18:51.040 --> 01:18:55.280
play them way too much on the radio and you kind of get sick of them, but I love how these

01:18:55.280 --> 01:19:01.160
songs give a whole new look to these songs, and even some folks in chat were saying about

01:19:01.160 --> 01:19:05.160
that Hollaback Girl song, that's the best they've ever heard that song.

01:19:05.160 --> 01:19:10.320
And not everything in those songs were just a part of the soundtrack, you were actually

01:19:10.320 --> 01:19:13.120
rewinding, you were doing the freestyle horns, right?

01:19:13.120 --> 01:19:16.800
Freestyle, and then also there's parts where you can distort it, and I was using the Effector

01:19:16.800 --> 01:19:20.800
dial on there to distort some of the tracks in there too.

01:19:20.800 --> 01:19:23.740
So there's a lot of stuff that you can kind of add on top of it, and actually there's

01:19:23.740 --> 01:19:27.800
a port in there where you can add a microphone too, I think a headset microphone, if you

01:19:27.800 --> 01:19:33.160
want to talk over stuff, but that's tough enough, but yeah, I did screw up a few spots

01:19:33.160 --> 01:19:38.480
where it dropped out, it's really touchy, it's sensitive to where, and the scratches

01:19:38.480 --> 01:19:43.360
too early sometimes, but it's fun, and we'll have to definitely do it again once we get

01:19:43.360 --> 01:19:44.880
the full game.

01:19:44.880 --> 01:19:49.000
Now Bobby does want me to say in chat, obviously All Games Radio would prefer no bootlegs be

01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:53.920
released as we could be held liable just saying, yeah, so obviously I was kidding before, so

01:19:53.920 --> 01:19:57.440
don't release bootlegs because we don't want the fine folks to host our show here.

01:19:57.440 --> 01:20:01.560
A lot of these songs I think are already out there, like in numerous gameplay clips.

01:20:01.560 --> 01:20:07.440
I was commenting that I think that the Hollaback Boy Girl would and whatever, that I have a

01:20:07.440 --> 01:20:11.660
very similar mashup on a disc that I bought in Berkeley.

01:20:11.660 --> 01:20:15.200
And honestly this is all just promotion for Activision anyway, because honestly if I wasn't

01:20:15.200 --> 01:20:19.760
sold on this game already, I am fucking buying this day one now, so, and I think a lot of

01:20:19.760 --> 01:20:23.280
folks in chat that were skeptical about the soundtrack have probably, you know, for the

01:20:23.280 --> 01:20:28.600
most part been overwhelmingly approved, so we've done a good thing for Activision here,

01:20:28.600 --> 01:20:32.720
but still for legal reasons, yeah, we said what we said.

01:20:32.720 --> 01:20:37.640
So, let's see, what else, yeah, DJ Dark Knight says don't copy that floppy.

01:20:37.640 --> 01:20:44.160
Back to the songs, let's see, Cheeseburger does say sorry but I hate those songs set

01:20:44.160 --> 01:20:47.880
for the synth in Satisfaction, which is a part of the original song anyway.

01:20:47.880 --> 01:20:51.160
There's, well they have a lot of stuff, like there's some hip hop songs in there that I'm

01:20:51.160 --> 01:20:55.960
not going to be too excited to play, but you know, there's a lot of songs like this, like

01:20:55.960 --> 01:20:59.120
the Daft Punk stuff, I'm all over the Daft Punk stuff, that's going to be awesome.

01:20:59.120 --> 01:21:01.960
And of course we have downloadable stuff on the horizon too, right?

01:21:01.960 --> 01:21:02.960
Yeah.

01:21:02.960 --> 01:21:03.960
Eventually.

01:21:03.960 --> 01:21:04.960
Eventually.

01:21:04.960 --> 01:21:05.960
Yeah.

01:21:05.960 --> 01:21:06.960
Hopefully so.

01:21:06.960 --> 01:21:07.960
Hopefully there's a lot.

01:21:07.960 --> 01:21:08.960
This game looks pretty hot.

01:21:08.960 --> 01:21:13.560
I'm a little sad I didn't get to play, but even just watching was fun, so there you go.

01:21:13.560 --> 01:21:14.560
So, alright.

01:21:14.560 --> 01:21:18.960
Well, we do have plenty more going on in the world than just DJ Hero and part of that is

01:21:18.960 --> 01:21:24.480
going to the Twitter and reading some of your Twitter topics for tonight.

01:21:24.480 --> 01:21:30.280
And there's a lot of DJ Hero talk on our Twitter feed right now, but we do have some questions.

01:21:30.280 --> 01:21:32.200
Let's get to some quick Twitter topics tonight.

01:21:32.200 --> 01:21:37.760
Ryan Belknap on Twitter at Twitter.com slash O-L-R. Uh oh, I have the hiccups, worst thing

01:21:37.760 --> 01:21:38.760
in radio to have.

01:21:38.760 --> 01:21:42.840
Excuse me, wants to know, what do you think about all of the games that were pushed back

01:21:42.840 --> 01:21:43.840
over the last month?

01:21:43.840 --> 01:21:45.160
Will they be worth the wait?

01:21:45.160 --> 01:21:46.160
Loki?

01:21:46.160 --> 01:21:50.240
There's a lot that I was waiting for to come out that have been pushed back, like Red Dead

01:21:50.240 --> 01:21:54.680
to Redemption, which I'm very excited to play because it's Grand Theft Auto in the Wild

01:21:54.680 --> 01:21:56.480
West.

01:21:56.480 --> 01:22:02.200
And also, I'm trying to think of other stuff I was waiting for that are, I'm kind of glad

01:22:02.200 --> 01:22:05.880
a lot of it's been pushed back because I don't have the money to buy all these right now.

01:22:05.880 --> 01:22:11.420
Like I'll be picking up Borderlands probably in two weeks, I'll be picking up DJ Hero hopefully

01:22:11.420 --> 01:22:14.820
earlier than that.

01:22:14.820 --> 01:22:18.920
And I think those two right there are going to pretty much wrap up my year as far as what

01:22:18.920 --> 01:22:26.060
I'm buying, you know, Left 4 Dead, well maybe New Super Mario Brothers, I'm on the fence

01:22:26.060 --> 01:22:32.560
with that, like probably won't buy it, but you know, at least DJ Hero and Borderlands

01:22:32.560 --> 01:22:35.960
are the two that I'm looking forward to right now, but there's a lot of stuff that's coming

01:22:35.960 --> 01:22:41.920
out like Dead Rising 2 next year, just a ton of stuff that was coming out this fourth quarter

01:22:41.920 --> 01:22:43.360
that's now pushed back.

01:22:43.360 --> 01:22:46.560
I'm okay with games getting pushed back because honestly I have barely enough time to play

01:22:46.560 --> 01:22:50.120
the games that are out there already, especially when you have a game like Demon's Souls, it's

01:22:50.120 --> 01:22:53.440
going to take me 100 hours just to get to level 2.

01:22:53.440 --> 01:22:57.720
You know, there's not, my gaming time's kind of spread out, but then again 2010's just

01:22:57.720 --> 01:22:58.720
going to look worse.

01:22:58.720 --> 01:23:01.640
I was looking forward to Blur, I'm kind of sad that that game got pushed back, but you

01:23:01.640 --> 01:23:04.600
know, DJ Hero's going to be really cool and there's still some stuff coming out.

01:23:04.600 --> 01:23:07.520
And some of the games I bought already are really taking my time.

01:23:07.520 --> 01:23:13.560
So, Gamer Girl on Twitter wants to know, what's anyone's favorite video game soundtrack?

01:23:13.560 --> 01:23:15.360
Favorite video game soundtrack?

01:23:15.360 --> 01:23:18.940
Beatmania 2DX 5th style is one of my favorites.

01:23:18.940 --> 01:23:23.760
I can't really think about the dancing games, the music games, considering.

01:23:23.760 --> 01:23:28.520
So I'm going to say that as far as a soundtrack that I can just sit and listen to over and

01:23:28.520 --> 01:23:32.000
over again, probably, um, Klonoa.

01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:33.000
Hmm.

01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:34.000
Okay.

01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:35.440
Klonoa or Chrono Trigger.

01:23:35.440 --> 01:23:36.440
Good choice.

01:23:36.440 --> 01:23:41.180
I would, I'm going to be just total stereotypical and go with the Final Fantasy series.

01:23:41.180 --> 01:23:44.240
Just because the Final Fantasy, you know, especially series like Final Fantasy XI,

01:23:44.240 --> 01:23:47.480
you know, you do listen to that music so often when you play those games that it has to have

01:23:47.480 --> 01:23:51.880
good music, so I would say a game like Final Fantasy XI or probably my favorite soundtrack

01:23:51.880 --> 01:23:54.360
in the entire series was VI, Final Fantasy VI.

01:23:54.360 --> 01:24:00.600
I'd have to go with VI, although the spin-off soundtracks were pretty good, like, um, Final

01:24:00.600 --> 01:24:02.480
Fantasy, Prey, and Celtic Moon.

01:24:02.480 --> 01:24:03.480
Both fantastic.

01:24:03.480 --> 01:24:05.760
Loki, any favorites for you?

01:24:05.760 --> 01:24:14.480
Um, I don't know, like, I'd say maybe DDR 5th or Max 2 would probably be my favorite

01:24:14.480 --> 01:24:15.480
soundtracks.

01:24:15.480 --> 01:24:18.440
Um, Katamari's pretty good.

01:24:18.440 --> 01:24:20.240
I don't know.

01:24:20.240 --> 01:24:22.960
Spazinator has two quick topics for us.

01:24:22.960 --> 01:24:25.880
Your video game related pet peeves.

01:24:25.880 --> 01:24:30.060
Mine would be, um, arcades replacing arcade machines with redemption machines.

01:24:30.060 --> 01:24:31.720
That's a pet peeve of mine.

01:24:31.720 --> 01:24:35.280
I mean, I understand why it's happening, but it's still a pet peeve.

01:24:35.280 --> 01:24:38.820
Mine are programmed in quarter drainers for arcades.

01:24:38.820 --> 01:24:47.760
For console, um, it would be, um, oh, you know, I really don't know.

01:24:47.760 --> 01:24:49.400
Probably bad voice acting.

01:24:49.400 --> 01:24:54.600
Um, my other pet peeve would be Xbox Live Griefers, just the people on there and go,

01:24:54.600 --> 01:24:59.360
you know, NNNFFF, you know, you know what I mean.

01:24:59.360 --> 01:25:03.440
Fixing stuff that doesn't need to be fixed or just, you know, not adding features that

01:25:03.440 --> 01:25:05.100
should be completely simple to add.

01:25:05.100 --> 01:25:11.520
For example, Grand Theft Auto 4, um, the multiplayer, you can set your time limits, you know, for

01:25:11.520 --> 01:25:19.360
5, 10, 15 minutes, 20 minutes, 30 minutes, and then it jumps to 45 minutes.

01:25:19.360 --> 01:25:22.760
If you want to play a 35 minute game, you have to play two games, and it's annoying.

01:25:22.760 --> 01:25:26.440
Like in Saints Row, you can play anything from a 1 minute long game to a 60 minute game

01:25:26.440 --> 01:25:29.520
and just set it any amount of time in between, and I don't understand why they have to take

01:25:29.520 --> 01:25:30.520
that out.

01:25:30.520 --> 01:25:33.960
Or, when they updated for Lost and Damned, let's remove the helicopters out of free mode.

01:25:33.960 --> 01:25:35.320
Yeah, that's an awesome idea.

01:25:35.320 --> 01:25:36.320
Why the hell did you do that?

01:25:36.320 --> 01:25:37.880
It's just, there's no point.

01:25:37.880 --> 01:25:41.480
Uh, we'll let Spaznator have a second question here on Twitter Topics tonight, because he

01:25:41.480 --> 01:25:45.280
managed to fit two questions in 140 characters, so we'll let him do it.

01:25:45.280 --> 01:25:48.880
What each console and their respective services can do to improve.

01:25:48.880 --> 01:25:50.840
What could each console do to improve?

01:25:50.840 --> 01:25:53.720
Anyone want to tackle this first?

01:25:53.720 --> 01:25:55.400
What can each console do to improve?

01:25:55.400 --> 01:25:56.400
Yeah, what could the Wii do?

01:25:56.400 --> 01:25:57.400
What could the 360 do?

01:25:57.400 --> 01:25:58.840
What could the PS3 do?

01:25:58.840 --> 01:26:03.700
Well, the Wii, first of all, could have online play.

01:26:03.700 --> 01:26:09.800
The Xbox 360 can, I don't know, they're pretty damn awesome.

01:26:09.800 --> 01:26:12.080
I guess have better filters.

01:26:12.080 --> 01:26:15.760
And the PS3 can be a different system.

01:26:15.760 --> 01:26:18.600
Loki?

01:26:18.600 --> 01:26:25.040
The Wii needs an actual online something, other than just browsing a flash, not even

01:26:25.040 --> 01:26:28.800
a flash, like a JavaScript store for games and stuff.

01:26:28.800 --> 01:26:33.560
They need something more substantial, like the PlayStation Network and Xbox Live.

01:26:33.560 --> 01:26:37.600
PlayStation Network needs more download content on there, as far as game releases and stuff

01:26:37.600 --> 01:26:44.520
like that, because Xbox Live has at least one or two new games coming out each week.

01:26:44.520 --> 01:26:48.920
You'd be lucky to find that over on the PlayStation Network, and I understand that they have PlayStation

01:26:48.920 --> 01:26:53.360
Originals and stuff like that, but come on, a little bit more and more demos for that

01:26:53.360 --> 01:26:55.000
kind of stuff.

01:26:55.000 --> 01:27:04.200
And then Xbox Live, I would say probably a way to purchase stuff where I don't have to

01:27:04.200 --> 01:27:08.760
just buy points in a big lot, like how the PlayStation Network has it, if the purchase

01:27:08.760 --> 01:27:13.200
is over $5, I can pay for the exact amount and be done with it, and that'd be nice, instead

01:27:13.200 --> 01:27:15.360
of having all these extra points lying around.

01:27:15.360 --> 01:27:19.360
I hate doing the point conversion crap.

01:27:19.360 --> 01:27:22.640
I definitely have the definitive answers, in my opinion, for these three consoles.

01:27:22.640 --> 01:27:27.700
The Wii needs to embrace online, period, Nintendo needs to stop being afraid of online and see

01:27:27.700 --> 01:27:32.980
how it can work for them in large doses, but I honestly don't think the Wii can be remedied

01:27:32.980 --> 01:27:33.980
in its current state.

01:27:33.980 --> 01:27:37.320
I think it is what it is, I think it's been pigeon-holed for what it is, it's not necessarily

01:27:37.320 --> 01:27:40.920
a bad thing, it is the number one console in America right now, whether we like it or

01:27:40.920 --> 01:27:45.980
not as hardcore gamers, but I would say if they want to woo the hardcore gamers back,

01:27:45.980 --> 01:27:50.420
they're going to need to fix some things with Wii HD, which we all know is inevitable.

01:27:50.420 --> 01:27:52.880
Question three, I couldn't disagree with Dark Sakura more.

01:27:52.880 --> 01:27:57.200
I think they did exactly what they needed to do this year, and that was drop the price

01:27:57.200 --> 01:28:00.800
to a reasonable point, and I think they're on a path for success right now.

01:28:00.800 --> 01:28:03.240
I think the PS3's been doing a lot right this year.

01:28:03.240 --> 01:28:05.640
PSP Go, completely different story.

01:28:05.640 --> 01:28:09.920
PS3, I think, is a console I would recommend to friends this Christmas.

01:28:09.920 --> 01:28:14.320
The biggest thing they could do now, focus on working, selling those consoles, and getting

01:28:14.320 --> 01:28:17.760
more exclusives would be the biggest thing they could do right now.

01:28:17.760 --> 01:28:21.400
Yeah, my PS3 is a Blu-ray player.

01:28:21.400 --> 01:28:26.120
See now, I can't say that, because especially now that my 360's been broken, I've been able

01:28:26.120 --> 01:28:27.840
to value the PlayStation more as-

01:28:27.840 --> 01:28:34.160
Now, tell me, when your Xbox 360 is fixed, is that going to change?

01:28:34.160 --> 01:28:38.200
Are you going to immediately remember everything that you liked better about the Xbox 360?

01:28:38.200 --> 01:28:42.000
It'll be about half and half, because here's my thing for the 360, and yes, there will

01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:48.640
be games that I will buy on the PlayStation 3 over the 360, because this 360 lacks hardcore

01:28:48.640 --> 01:28:53.920
in this one place, and what the 360 needs to fix, anyone?

01:28:53.920 --> 01:28:57.400
The controller sucks on the Xbox 360.

01:28:57.400 --> 01:28:58.800
I disagree.

01:28:58.800 --> 01:28:59.800
Especially the D-pad.

01:28:59.800 --> 01:29:00.800
The D-pad is ass.

01:29:00.800 --> 01:29:01.800
The D-pad is horrible.

01:29:01.800 --> 01:29:02.800
I disagree.

01:29:02.800 --> 01:29:03.800
You can't play retro games.

01:29:03.800 --> 01:29:04.800
Oh my, really?

01:29:04.800 --> 01:29:05.800
Why?

01:29:05.800 --> 01:29:08.960
I've had actually absolutely no problem playing on the Xbox 360.

01:29:08.960 --> 01:29:13.800
The controller size, first of all, is more comfortable to the shape of my hands.

01:29:13.800 --> 01:29:17.120
Why else do you think that I like the Saturn dual analog controller, even though that one

01:29:17.120 --> 01:29:21.040
seemed kind of, you know, on the unwieldy side when you look at it?

01:29:21.040 --> 01:29:25.520
It actually, everything, like I was playing through just a number of games and having

01:29:25.520 --> 01:29:29.600
a zero problem, like, well, Dan had problems with Mr. Driller, I didn't.

01:29:29.600 --> 01:29:33.740
I mean, it may just be I've got, you know, smaller hands than both of you guys, but I

01:29:33.740 --> 01:29:38.700
don't really have much of a problem with playing games on the Xbox 360.

01:29:38.700 --> 01:29:46.520
I actually hate a lot of the PS3 games just because, I mean, first of all, they'll rely

01:29:46.520 --> 01:29:51.180
on different visual effects that the Xbox 360 just doesn't need.

01:29:51.180 --> 01:29:56.120
And also, in comparison, there's certain games that are coming out, namely Bayonetta, that

01:29:56.120 --> 01:30:02.360
is going to be completely utter crap on PS3 as opposed to Xbox 360, both in terms of graphics,

01:30:02.360 --> 01:30:07.840
processor speed, you know, how the game functions on the system.

01:30:07.840 --> 01:30:13.160
So honestly, I think that the Xbox 360 controller, to me, is more comfortable in my hands.

01:30:13.160 --> 01:30:21.520
That's why I got this on Xbox 360, as in Marvel Ultimate Alliance 2, instead of PlayStation

01:30:21.520 --> 01:30:27.240
3, which I've played the first one on both systems, and to this day, the control is infinitely

01:30:27.240 --> 01:30:29.560
better on the Xbox 360.

01:30:29.560 --> 01:30:34.360
Just playing Mega Man 9 on the 360 controller and playing it on a PS3 controller made me

01:30:34.360 --> 01:30:37.160
want to just build my own 360 controller.

01:30:37.160 --> 01:30:39.240
I just cannot play some games on the 360.

01:30:39.240 --> 01:30:40.240
I'm not hating on Microsoft.

01:30:40.240 --> 01:30:41.240
They do a lot right.

01:30:41.240 --> 01:30:45.600
I mean, to be fair, if I'm picking on that, there's, I mean, 360's done a lot of brilliant

01:30:45.600 --> 01:30:46.600
things this year.

01:30:46.600 --> 01:30:47.860
One versus 100 was awesome.

01:30:47.860 --> 01:30:52.760
They continue to lead the charge in online gaming, but, you know, if I could fix something,

01:30:52.760 --> 01:30:55.080
that would be the first place to start as a new controller.

01:30:55.080 --> 01:30:57.600
Well, third parties make other controllers, I think.

01:30:57.600 --> 01:30:59.300
Doesn't Hori make one as well, or?

01:30:59.300 --> 01:31:04.160
I don't think any of them really just radically change the design, though.

01:31:04.160 --> 01:31:06.400
So anyhow.

01:31:06.400 --> 01:31:09.000
And Brad, you know, you have a fan in, uh, Brad from Pod Culture.

01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:13.040
He says he prefers the 360 controller over the PS3 any day.

01:31:13.040 --> 01:31:14.040
Yeah.

01:31:14.040 --> 01:31:15.040
How about the noise of the system?

01:31:15.040 --> 01:31:18.080
That would be the other thing I'd want to fix, is that when I am trying to watch Netflix

01:31:18.080 --> 01:31:22.080
or movies on the 360, it sounds like Mom's running the vacuum cleaner behind me.

01:31:22.080 --> 01:31:23.080
I don't notice.

01:31:23.080 --> 01:31:24.080
Really?

01:31:24.080 --> 01:31:26.960
Well, keep in mind how my setup is.

01:31:26.960 --> 01:31:33.040
I have everything together under the, uh, the drawer on there, so really, I don't really

01:31:33.040 --> 01:31:34.040
hear it.

01:31:34.040 --> 01:31:40.520
The only time that I hear it is when we have the subwoofer off, and the game volume very

01:31:40.520 --> 01:31:46.000
low, and my hearing is extra sensitive, or, you know, that type of thing.

01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:51.560
Or if, like, someone's turned off the TV and left the system on, or if the game is on pause,

01:31:51.560 --> 01:31:52.560
then I hear the system.

01:31:52.560 --> 01:31:55.280
But I don't really hear it when I'm playing.

01:31:55.280 --> 01:32:00.240
Then again, we've got the surround sound setup and everything, too, so it's hard to hear

01:32:00.240 --> 01:32:01.240
yourself breathe.

01:32:01.240 --> 01:32:02.240
All right.

01:32:02.240 --> 01:32:08.880
One more question here, Surtur from our Twitter wants to know, are PSP mini games too expensive?

01:32:08.880 --> 01:32:13.440
Are the regular PSN download games too expensive in comparison to the UMD prices?

01:32:13.440 --> 01:32:15.480
Yes and yes.

01:32:15.480 --> 01:32:16.480
That's his opinion.

01:32:16.480 --> 01:32:20.480
Um, for me, I don't, I can't answer this, and I doubt the others can, too.

01:32:20.480 --> 01:32:22.000
I haven't played a PSP mini game yet.

01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:23.300
I haven't paid to download one.

01:32:23.300 --> 01:32:26.560
I couldn't tell you if they're worth the money or not, so I don't know.

01:32:26.560 --> 01:32:28.760
I keep forgetting they exist.

01:32:28.760 --> 01:32:35.560
I do think people forget what $5 or $10 is supposed to get you.

01:32:35.560 --> 01:32:42.960
And honestly, I think $10 is not that much money for a video game, and, you know, considering

01:32:42.960 --> 01:32:47.560
that most games now cost $60 used, I think most of these arcade games, I mean, this goes

01:32:47.560 --> 01:32:53.160
for Xbox Live and the minis or what have you, $10 for a game is not unreasonable, especially

01:32:53.160 --> 01:32:55.760
if the game's good.

01:32:55.760 --> 01:32:56.760
But I don't know.

01:32:56.760 --> 01:32:59.000
I haven't played any PSP mini games, so I couldn't tell you.

01:32:59.000 --> 01:33:03.880
As far as the regular PSN download games too expensive in comparison to UMD prices, I,

01:33:03.880 --> 01:33:04.880
you know what?

01:33:04.880 --> 01:33:09.240
I'm all for the PSN download thing for convenience, but I'm also all for competition, and this

01:33:09.240 --> 01:33:15.200
is why I do not like the PSP Go, and I don't really care for where it's headed with games.

01:33:15.200 --> 01:33:20.080
I don't like the fact that there's only one source to buy the games, and it is, you know,

01:33:20.080 --> 01:33:24.720
something I haven't given a lot of thought to until the system was released, but competition

01:33:24.720 --> 01:33:30.160
is usually a pretty healthy thing, and, you know, if this digital distribution thing keeps

01:33:30.160 --> 01:33:35.520
going and, you know, online is the only place we're able to buy games, that is, through

01:33:35.520 --> 01:33:40.560
Sony or through Microsoft in the future, if they do something similar, that's gonna be

01:33:40.560 --> 01:33:44.960
a little worrisome, because competition right now is what keeps things awesome.

01:33:44.960 --> 01:33:51.600
What's a website like CheapAssGamer gonna do if all the consoles go digital distribution?

01:33:51.600 --> 01:33:55.960
There's always gonna be older stuff that's out there, so, and I don't think it's ever

01:33:55.960 --> 01:34:02.040
gonna go away completely, because GameStop's not gonna let it go away completely, so, and

01:34:02.040 --> 01:34:06.360
despite every nice thing I said about PlayStation 3 earlier, I still think the PSP Go is a big

01:34:06.360 --> 01:34:12.760
joke, and if you want to get a PSP, get a PSP 3000, and I would recommend a PSP 3000,

01:34:12.760 --> 01:34:14.760
but I would not recommend a PSP Go.

01:34:14.760 --> 01:34:19.120
All right, um, that's enough for Twitter topics, we talked a lot about those Twitter topics.

01:34:19.120 --> 01:34:25.280
Let's move on with some rapid-fire news tonight on Orange Lawn's radio.

01:34:25.280 --> 01:34:27.360
Loki, start us off with some quick news.

01:34:27.360 --> 01:34:32.760
Well, I may not support the iPhone, they are getting a lot of games, and one game that

01:34:32.760 --> 01:34:37.640
I like that's pretty awesome, Command & Conquer Red Alert will now be coming to the iPhone

01:34:37.640 --> 01:34:44.520
this October, and will feature 12 levels in the game, and looks pretty awesome from the

01:34:44.520 --> 01:34:48.800
screenshots, so, you know, hey, Red Alert's awesome, so definitely worth checking it out,

01:34:48.800 --> 01:34:54.280
and, you know, with the touchscreen and everything, it should be perfect, since this is an RTS.

01:34:54.280 --> 01:35:01.360
There is a fan movie released this week, actually kind of a mini Turbo, the movie, kind of showing

01:35:01.360 --> 01:35:07.320
what a Street Fighter-esque type game would be played like in the future, and kind of

01:35:07.320 --> 01:35:14.880
revolves around, you know, this player who's, you know, almost like a plot to, say, The

01:35:14.880 --> 01:35:19.680
Wizard or something like that, you know, he's getting better at this one game in order to

01:35:19.680 --> 01:35:26.520
fight somebody in this competition, and it's pretty neat because, I guess, his brother

01:35:26.520 --> 01:35:31.920
in the movie or something was like a Tae Kwon Do master or something like that, and so now

01:35:31.920 --> 01:35:36.880
he's getting trained from him to fight in this game and stuff, but the movie itself

01:35:36.880 --> 01:35:43.600
is available online for free, or you can grab a DVD for it, and it actually, you know, it's

01:35:43.600 --> 01:35:51.760
got a pretty decent story to it, and I think 20 minutes or so, so yeah, 23 minutes, so

01:35:51.760 --> 01:35:56.160
definitely worth checking it out, and you can check it out at turbothemovie.com, so

01:35:56.160 --> 01:35:57.880
that's pretty sweet.

01:35:57.880 --> 01:36:05.480
Finally, there is a Resistance 3 billboard that's been spotted, and apparently this is

01:36:05.480 --> 01:36:10.280
part of a background for a movie coming out called Battle of Los Angeles, which is due

01:36:10.280 --> 01:36:14.840
out in 2011, although it's not really a big surprise that, you know, Resistance would

01:36:14.840 --> 01:36:21.960
be, you know, Resistance 3 would be coming out eventually, but it's surprising, I guess,

01:36:21.960 --> 01:36:26.360
to see a billboard for it, and apparently I do see something that was blacked out that

01:36:26.360 --> 01:36:28.960
looks like a website, so interesting.

01:36:28.960 --> 01:36:34.200
Alright, I got some rapid-fire news for you guys tonight, starting off with some Rockband

01:36:34.200 --> 01:36:35.200
updates.

01:36:35.200 --> 01:36:38.080
Here's some of the tracks coming to Rockband next week, October 13th, if you're on the

01:36:38.080 --> 01:36:40.760
360 or the 15th, if you're on the PS3.

01:36:40.760 --> 01:36:45.040
There's a Brutal Legend pack making its way out, coming with Motorhead, We Are The Road

01:36:45.040 --> 01:36:49.840
Crew 08, Testament, More Than Meets The Eye, and of course Tenacious D with the metal,

01:36:49.840 --> 01:36:52.880
since, you know, Jack Black is one of the voices in Brutal Legend.

01:36:52.880 --> 01:36:58.240
Some other individual songs coming out for the bands Black Tide, Joe Satriani, Kansas,

01:36:58.240 --> 01:37:01.520
L7, and Blink-182 with What's My Age Again.

01:37:01.520 --> 01:37:03.800
That was one of the videos you would see on TV all the time.

01:37:03.800 --> 01:37:06.260
So I bet L7's is Pretend That We're Dead.

01:37:06.260 --> 01:37:07.260
That's already in the game.

01:37:07.260 --> 01:37:10.080
And, well, then the other...

01:37:10.080 --> 01:37:11.920
Andres is the song that's coming.

01:37:11.920 --> 01:37:14.780
So there it is.

01:37:14.780 --> 01:37:20.360
In other news, Jordan Mechner has filed a trademark for Prince of Persia, The Forgotten

01:37:20.360 --> 01:37:21.360
Sands.

01:37:21.360 --> 01:37:24.480
Of course, Jordan Mechner is the creator of the Prince of Persia series, after all.

01:37:24.480 --> 01:37:30.040
So that may be something where, I don't know if that's something where the new Prince of

01:37:30.040 --> 01:37:31.440
Persia series is headed.

01:37:31.440 --> 01:37:33.320
That also might tie in with the movie, too.

01:37:33.320 --> 01:37:36.840
That is very true, is that it could be a sequel to the movie that's coming out this year.

01:37:36.840 --> 01:37:39.920
I think Sands of Time is what it's based on.

01:37:39.920 --> 01:37:45.440
So it sounds like it could be a tie-in movie or maybe the next Prince of Persia game.

01:37:45.440 --> 01:37:46.440
You never know.

01:37:46.440 --> 01:37:50.840
But just so it's also stated, though, Mechner did once file a trademark called Prince of

01:37:50.840 --> 01:37:56.060
Persia Prodigy that was never brought to light, at least as of yet.

01:37:56.060 --> 01:37:58.680
So who knows if that will come to light at all.

01:37:58.680 --> 01:38:02.160
And one more story for you real quick about the game Rocket Knight.

01:38:02.160 --> 01:38:03.280
It's coming back.

01:38:03.280 --> 01:38:09.680
Xbox Live, PlayStation Network, and Steam will be seeing this game in 2010.

01:38:09.680 --> 01:38:13.640
This is coming from Konami, has made this game.

01:38:13.640 --> 01:38:17.600
It's going to be on Xbox Live Arcade and all that good stuff in early 2010.

01:38:17.600 --> 01:38:18.600
It is not a remake.

01:38:18.600 --> 01:38:24.400
It is a sequel 15 years after the last Rocket Knight.

01:38:24.400 --> 01:38:25.400
It looks pretty sweet, too.

01:38:25.400 --> 01:38:27.200
Have you seen the screenshots or trailer yet?

01:38:27.200 --> 01:38:30.320
I've just seen one screenshot, but I haven't seen the trailer.

01:38:30.320 --> 01:38:31.320
It looks neat.

01:38:31.320 --> 01:38:32.320
I don't know.

01:38:32.320 --> 01:38:33.320
I never played the original.

01:38:33.320 --> 01:38:34.320
Did you play it?

01:38:34.320 --> 01:38:35.320
No.

01:38:35.320 --> 01:38:37.600
Is this something Dark Sakura maybe played at all?

01:38:37.600 --> 01:38:38.600
Rocket Knight?

01:38:38.600 --> 01:38:39.600
No.

01:38:39.600 --> 01:38:40.600
All right.

01:38:40.600 --> 01:38:42.360
Well, Climax is developing the game.

01:38:42.360 --> 01:38:45.160
They were the folks buying Silent Hill Origins.

01:38:45.160 --> 01:38:46.840
So there you go.

01:38:46.840 --> 01:38:48.480
Dark Sakura!

01:38:48.480 --> 01:38:56.720
Well, for news of Halo 3 ODST, they actually made up...

01:38:56.720 --> 01:38:59.800
Sorry, I'm getting dinged.

01:38:59.800 --> 01:39:01.800
My apologies.

01:39:01.800 --> 01:39:09.480
Actually are getting hit a 27 million game sold, which is pretty good.

01:39:09.480 --> 01:39:13.920
So I'm sorry, that's total Halo game sold is up to 27 million.

01:39:13.920 --> 01:39:21.960
Actually for ODST, 2.5 million copies have been sold within the last two weeks.

01:39:21.960 --> 01:39:24.840
Also there's to be a little bit more for it.

01:39:24.840 --> 01:39:30.880
That means that we're going to be potentially seeing Master Chief come out in one of the

01:39:30.880 --> 01:39:33.580
future expansions.

01:39:33.580 --> 01:39:39.200
And they also know that there were a few cliffhangers that need to be resolved.

01:39:39.200 --> 01:39:44.660
But they're saying that they have a plan that's going out at least six years.

01:39:44.660 --> 01:39:49.920
And it actually is going to tie in all the canon, including comic books and novels.

01:39:49.920 --> 01:39:52.400
That sounds ambitious.

01:39:52.400 --> 01:39:57.080
Also for Marvel Ultimate Alliance 2, they're getting Carnage.

01:39:57.080 --> 01:40:04.280
And Carnage is, well, as everyone hopes, not just another Spider-Man and not just another

01:40:04.280 --> 01:40:11.480
Venom but full on psycho, crazy, honorless, vicious, did I say crazy?

01:40:11.480 --> 01:40:12.480
Because I mean crazy.

01:40:12.480 --> 01:40:14.880
Carnage is fucking nuts.

01:40:14.880 --> 01:40:15.880
So yeah.

01:40:15.880 --> 01:40:17.240
Begetting Carnage.

01:40:17.240 --> 01:40:18.680
Woot.

01:40:18.680 --> 01:40:25.660
And then Activision filed a particular trademark for a particular adaptation of a particular

01:40:25.660 --> 01:40:28.340
game to be made into a movie.

01:40:28.340 --> 01:40:31.000
And that would be Call of Duty.

01:40:31.000 --> 01:40:40.360
So I actually were, some of the people behind it were actually leaving hints about talking

01:40:40.360 --> 01:40:43.360
with different directors already.

01:40:43.360 --> 01:40:44.880
Cool.

01:40:44.880 --> 01:40:49.120
All right.

01:40:49.120 --> 01:40:50.960
That would be it for my quickie stuff.

01:40:50.960 --> 01:40:54.280
That would be interesting for a Call of Duty movie, but I suppose it's inevitable because

01:40:54.280 --> 01:40:55.280
the series is huge.

01:40:55.280 --> 01:40:57.560
I think Call of Duty would make a great movie.

01:40:57.560 --> 01:41:00.840
At least with Call of Duty, there is an actual storyline that goes along with it.

01:41:00.840 --> 01:41:05.840
It's not like, you know, okay, let's make a war movie and call it Call of Duty.

01:41:05.840 --> 01:41:07.120
I still wouldn't see it.

01:41:07.120 --> 01:41:08.440
I'm not a big fan of war movies.

01:41:08.440 --> 01:41:09.440
Exactly.

01:41:09.440 --> 01:41:10.440
I like chick flicks.

01:41:10.440 --> 01:41:11.440
All right.

01:41:11.440 --> 01:41:12.440
Call of Duty, the chick flick?

01:41:12.440 --> 01:41:16.080
No, they don't need to do Call of Duty, the chick flick.

01:41:16.080 --> 01:41:17.080
That would be pretty funny.

01:41:17.080 --> 01:41:21.540
You know, Final Fantasy is kind of a chick flick in some ways, especially emo ones like

01:41:21.540 --> 01:41:22.860
Final Fantasy 7.

01:41:22.860 --> 01:41:25.520
If they turn Final Fantasy 7 into a movie, that's kind of a chick flick.

01:41:25.520 --> 01:41:26.520
A little bit.

01:41:26.520 --> 01:41:32.520
They have, it's, you know, Advent Children wasn't so much a chick flick as it was just

01:41:32.520 --> 01:41:33.520
confusing.

01:41:33.520 --> 01:41:34.520
It was nonstop.

01:41:34.520 --> 01:41:35.520
Action is what it was.

01:41:35.520 --> 01:41:36.520
It doesn't need a plot.

01:41:36.520 --> 01:41:37.520
It's just ass kickery.

01:41:37.520 --> 01:41:38.520
In your face, ass kicking action.

01:41:38.520 --> 01:41:39.520
Cloud is emo.

01:41:39.520 --> 01:41:40.520
Vincent is dark.

01:41:40.520 --> 01:41:41.520
Cloud is emo.

01:41:41.520 --> 01:41:42.520
Vincent is dark.

01:41:42.520 --> 01:41:43.520
Look.

01:41:43.520 --> 01:41:44.520
Three sephiroths.

01:41:44.520 --> 01:41:47.520
Three sephirbrats.

01:41:47.520 --> 01:41:48.520
All right.

01:41:48.520 --> 01:41:49.520
The end.

01:41:49.520 --> 01:41:50.520
Exactly.

01:41:50.520 --> 01:41:51.520
P.S.

01:41:51.520 --> 01:41:52.520
Aerith is dead.

01:41:52.520 --> 01:41:53.520
P.S.

01:41:53.520 --> 01:41:54.520
Laura Klaw says I like the Twilight movies.

01:41:54.520 --> 01:41:55.520
Wrong.

01:41:55.520 --> 01:41:56.520
Ew.

01:41:56.520 --> 01:41:57.520
Ew.

01:41:57.520 --> 01:41:58.520
Ew.

01:41:58.520 --> 01:41:59.520
Sparkly vampires for the lose.

01:41:59.520 --> 01:42:00.520
No, no.

01:42:00.520 --> 01:42:02.760
I'm not a fan of the Twilight movies.

01:42:02.760 --> 01:42:03.760
I tried.

01:42:03.760 --> 01:42:06.360
Did I tell you I sat down and tried to read the first book?

01:42:06.360 --> 01:42:07.560
And I wanted to.

01:42:07.560 --> 01:42:08.780
Did you notice it?

01:42:08.780 --> 01:42:12.980
I'm glad it wasn't my book because it probably would have been the first book I ever burned.

01:42:12.980 --> 01:42:17.240
I've never read the book, but my wife asks, and she's, you know, show me parts.

01:42:17.240 --> 01:42:18.240
She's like, look at this.

01:42:18.240 --> 01:42:20.920
It's like they don't have an editor for this book.

01:42:20.920 --> 01:42:26.900
so many grammar and spelling and it just doesn't make any sense.

01:42:26.900 --> 01:42:27.900
Back to video games.

01:42:27.900 --> 01:42:28.900
Sorry.

01:42:28.900 --> 01:42:30.940
Just proving how crappy it is.

01:42:30.940 --> 01:42:33.560
Something not crappy though would be TrackMania.

01:42:33.560 --> 01:42:40.760
And Ubisoft has acquired the developer of TrackMania, Nadeo, and apparently they're

01:42:40.760 --> 01:42:44.240
doing it to build some online cred.

01:42:44.240 --> 01:42:49.240
And I hope this means that we do get a console version of TrackMania 2 because it looks absolutely

01:42:49.240 --> 01:42:50.240
awesome.

01:42:50.240 --> 01:42:54.320
It's supposed to start racing with kind of the Forza 3 graphics, so hey, that's not a

01:42:54.320 --> 01:42:56.400
bad combo whatsoever.

01:42:56.400 --> 01:43:01.080
And they say, through Nadeo, Ubisoft will gain an expert team, one of the best online

01:43:01.080 --> 01:43:06.240
technologies around, as well as a flagship multiplayer game that enjoys an unrivaled

01:43:06.240 --> 01:43:10.880
reputation among the loyal and committed community.

01:43:10.880 --> 01:43:14.400
And yeah, so awesome.

01:43:14.400 --> 01:43:18.280
It doesn't look like they're going to be canceling any TrackMania games, and hopefully we'll

01:43:18.280 --> 01:43:20.060
see this come to consoles.

01:43:20.060 --> 01:43:24.120
That's what I'm really hoping for, because the DS version was awesome, but not as good

01:43:24.120 --> 01:43:26.720
as a console release.

01:43:26.720 --> 01:43:28.720
All right.

01:43:28.720 --> 01:43:32.520
Well moving on to Facebook and Twitter on the Xbox 360.

01:43:32.520 --> 01:43:34.800
This is something a lot of folks have been looking forward to.

01:43:34.800 --> 01:43:39.520
Of course, Last.fm would be a part of this as well, but speaking specifically of Facebook

01:43:39.520 --> 01:43:45.640
and Twitter, there was a splash page spotted on Xbox Live's UK portal saying that the service

01:43:45.640 --> 01:43:48.100
is going to launch November 17th.

01:43:48.100 --> 01:43:53.420
Now of course, again, this was on the UK portal, but if I'm not mistaken, don't you get these

01:43:53.420 --> 01:43:54.960
updates worldwide?

01:43:54.960 --> 01:43:56.920
So if they get on the 17th, we would too?

01:43:56.920 --> 01:43:57.920
Pretty much, yeah.

01:43:57.920 --> 01:43:58.920
It'd be relatively close.

01:43:58.920 --> 01:43:59.920
Yeah.

01:43:59.920 --> 01:44:01.240
So that's what they're saying.

01:44:01.240 --> 01:44:05.040
This was spotted in a screenshot on the flash page, if you zoom in a lot there.

01:44:05.040 --> 01:44:08.300
And it is just assumed, even though Last.fm isn't featured on there, that this update

01:44:08.300 --> 01:44:11.420
is going to include that as well.

01:44:11.420 --> 01:44:15.040
So there was a little firmware update that went out not that long ago, kind of prepping

01:44:15.040 --> 01:44:17.360
the Xbox 360 for this.

01:44:17.360 --> 01:44:20.720
So this is going to be on its way, and that's assumed in November.

01:44:20.720 --> 01:44:24.120
I guess there's also going to be a beta test I was reading somewhere at the end of October

01:44:24.120 --> 01:44:28.280
for these services, but I'm kind of eh on these.

01:44:28.280 --> 01:44:32.000
I think the one cool thing would be maybe like taking screenshots and publishing them

01:44:32.000 --> 01:44:33.000
to Facebook.

01:44:33.000 --> 01:44:34.000
That'd be cool.

01:44:34.000 --> 01:44:38.600
But I don't see this being something I would want to use.

01:44:38.600 --> 01:44:42.400
And what I really don't want to happen is I don't want it to turn into, with all due

01:44:42.400 --> 01:44:44.720
respect to the people that made it, Raptor.

01:44:44.720 --> 01:44:48.320
Like I don't want my Xbox 360 tweeting every time I put in a new game.

01:44:48.320 --> 01:44:50.200
Because I know that's just going to irritate people.

01:44:50.200 --> 01:44:53.980
And part of the reason I'm really starting to hate Twitter is that there's no filters.

01:44:53.980 --> 01:44:56.680
Like Facebook is basically Twitter, but with filters.

01:44:56.680 --> 01:45:00.120
But you can also use TweetDeck.

01:45:00.120 --> 01:45:05.020
But even with TweetDeck, you can filter a certain person's tweets, which I do use.

01:45:05.020 --> 01:45:07.040
But you can't filter the type.

01:45:07.040 --> 01:45:10.520
If a person just posts annoying things over and over, I just unfollow them.

01:45:10.520 --> 01:45:11.520
Exactly.

01:45:11.520 --> 01:45:13.140
Like, I'm sorry, but it's just Twitter.

01:45:13.140 --> 01:45:18.660
Like if you're going to get butthurt over me unfollowing you, get something real to

01:45:18.660 --> 01:45:22.040
worry about, like Darfur or something.

01:45:22.040 --> 01:45:23.040
I don't know.

01:45:23.040 --> 01:45:25.840
But don't worry about me unfriending you on Twitter.

01:45:25.840 --> 01:45:27.640
It just means you post a lot of crap.

01:45:27.640 --> 01:45:33.080
So unfortunately, Twitter not having filters makes it really inferior to Facebook.

01:45:33.080 --> 01:45:36.480
And hopefully there'll be a magic button where I can just block all the 360 updates from

01:45:36.480 --> 01:45:38.260
Facebook if they're annoying.

01:45:38.260 --> 01:45:40.840
But if they aren't, then maybe I'll keep it around.

01:45:40.840 --> 01:45:41.960
We'll see.

01:45:41.960 --> 01:45:45.440
So Last.fm on the other hand sounds very cool, because I'm already using Last.fm.

01:45:45.440 --> 01:45:47.720
I have like 3,000 plays chalked up on there.

01:45:47.720 --> 01:45:50.240
And God, some people have way more than that.

01:45:50.240 --> 01:45:53.480
And I think Last.fm has a really good recommendation service.

01:45:53.480 --> 01:45:55.040
I prefer it to Pandora.

01:45:55.040 --> 01:45:58.040
I know a lot of people disagree with me and think Pandora is God.

01:45:58.040 --> 01:46:01.280
But I like that Last.fm kind of bases its recommendations off of what you already play.

01:46:01.280 --> 01:46:03.640
I use Last.fm at work sometimes.

01:46:03.640 --> 01:46:05.680
Pandora is really useless to me.

01:46:05.680 --> 01:46:06.880
Why is it blocked or something?

01:46:06.880 --> 01:46:07.880
On my phone.

01:46:07.880 --> 01:46:08.880
Oh.

01:46:08.880 --> 01:46:09.880
They do have a Pandora app on the phone.

01:46:09.880 --> 01:46:10.880
I know, but it's useless to me on my phone.

01:46:10.880 --> 01:46:14.680
And I prefer using Last.fm, because if I want to listen to the stuff that I've been listening

01:46:14.680 --> 01:46:18.400
to at home, then I may not have moved on to my iPhone then.

01:46:18.400 --> 01:46:22.280
And of course, they have an Enflow station.

01:46:22.280 --> 01:46:24.520
So I think Last.fm is pretty cool.

01:46:24.520 --> 01:46:26.400
I'm excited to see how it works on Xbox.

01:46:26.400 --> 01:46:28.240
I hope I can use it for background music.

01:46:28.240 --> 01:46:29.240
We'll see.

01:46:29.240 --> 01:46:33.680
But anyhow, that is all coming soon for Xbox Live Gold members getting a sneak peek.

01:46:33.680 --> 01:46:38.660
But it sounds like everybody will get to access it on November 17th in the UK.

01:46:38.660 --> 01:46:41.440
I'm sure the rest of us, hopefully, around the same time.

01:46:41.440 --> 01:46:47.560
SHJ100Matt says in our chat room, chat.orangehonestrader.com, I really hope this doesn't open my gamertag

01:46:47.560 --> 01:46:49.520
to the cam whores and porn spammers.

01:46:49.520 --> 01:46:51.800
Oh, I hope so too.

01:46:51.800 --> 01:46:56.900
But seeing as you have to follow them in order to see the messages on Twitter, hopefully,

01:46:56.900 --> 01:46:59.020
you know.

01:46:59.020 --> 01:47:03.400
And SalaciousPopInChat, I like this comment, LOL, it's not like LiveJournal where it's

01:47:03.400 --> 01:47:06.140
a grievous offense to de-friend someone.

01:47:06.140 --> 01:47:10.040
I totally agree because I totally get butthurt when people de-friend me on LiveJournal.

01:47:10.040 --> 01:47:11.040
It's like, what did I do?

01:47:11.040 --> 01:47:13.040
I'm doing it right now, Rob.

01:47:13.040 --> 01:47:14.040
No, don't cry.

01:47:14.040 --> 01:47:16.480
No, I do get butthurt when people un-friend me on LiveJournal.

01:47:16.480 --> 01:47:19.000
But I put a lot more of myself out there on LiveJournal.

01:47:19.000 --> 01:47:21.880
Twitter, I agree, is bullshit.

01:47:21.880 --> 01:47:25.880
Facebook, I always kind of wonder why someone would de-friend me on Facebook because it's

01:47:25.880 --> 01:47:26.880
just Facebook.

01:47:26.880 --> 01:47:31.120
But LiveJournal, I actually kind of get butthurt because I have a friends-only journal.

01:47:31.120 --> 01:47:34.700
And so if I let someone in to read it all and then they just leave, I'm kind of sad.

01:47:34.700 --> 01:47:39.280
So I like to know why or, you know, I'm a big boy.

01:47:39.280 --> 01:47:40.500
Tell me if you're unfollowing me.

01:47:40.500 --> 01:47:45.480
You post too many, you know, memes or you post too many advertisements for your LiveJournal

01:47:45.480 --> 01:47:46.480
games.

01:47:46.480 --> 01:47:47.480
Please tell me.

01:47:47.480 --> 01:47:50.240
Rob, I am so tired of that survivor thing.

01:47:50.240 --> 01:47:53.320
Which by the way, I'm hosting season 18 and we're looking for players.

01:47:53.320 --> 01:47:56.120
I think it's silly that there are 18 seasons.

01:47:56.120 --> 01:47:58.960
I, well, there's 20 of the real things, so believe it.

01:47:58.960 --> 01:47:59.960
All right, anyhow.

01:47:59.960 --> 01:48:03.840
I'm sad that it caught up that fast.

01:48:03.840 --> 01:48:06.640
It's just, it's no worse than role-play gaming online.

01:48:06.640 --> 01:48:07.640
That's what it is.

01:48:07.640 --> 01:48:08.640
It's role-play gaming.

01:48:08.640 --> 01:48:10.880
All right, anyway.

01:48:10.880 --> 01:48:14.280
Ray Ayanami in chat asked, what the hell is FarmVille or Mafia Wars?

01:48:14.280 --> 01:48:16.540
Well, obviously he has- Boring crap!

01:48:16.540 --> 01:48:20.920
I will say this though, Bejeweled Blitz got a makeover this week and it's awesome.

01:48:20.920 --> 01:48:23.160
Oh yeah, my wife's been playing that non-stop.

01:48:23.160 --> 01:48:24.440
It's awesome!

01:48:24.440 --> 01:48:27.760
They totally revamped the game and made it more awesomer.

01:48:27.760 --> 01:48:31.840
Well, Facebook finally did something right, speaking of their little games, that if I

01:48:31.840 --> 01:48:36.960
don't give a shit about what game you're playing, and by the way, Loki, your wife just posted

01:48:36.960 --> 01:48:37.960
weird pictures of herself.

01:48:37.960 --> 01:48:40.960
Wait a minute, did she- Yes, she did.

01:48:40.960 --> 01:48:41.960
Yes, yes.

01:48:41.960 --> 01:48:47.920
She, she, I was trying to post my live journal post of my finishing the cabinet and she was

01:48:47.920 --> 01:48:51.300
sitting next to me because I had my camera there that I had just taken pictures with,

01:48:51.300 --> 01:48:55.560
taking weird pictures of herself and standing there and going, hey, look at this.

01:48:55.560 --> 01:48:56.560
Hey, look at this.

01:48:56.560 --> 01:48:57.560
Hey, look at this.

01:48:57.560 --> 01:49:00.840
Then she started taking pictures of me too and it was annoying, so.

01:49:00.840 --> 01:49:02.480
I'm like, knock it off.

01:49:02.480 --> 01:49:07.640
Okay, what's more annoying, wife taking pictures of you or Farmville?

01:49:07.640 --> 01:49:08.640
Farmville.

01:49:08.640 --> 01:49:09.640
Farmville.

01:49:09.640 --> 01:49:14.040
But actually, someone pointed out to me that you can hide those little app announcements

01:49:14.040 --> 01:49:15.040
when people announce this shit.

01:49:15.040 --> 01:49:16.040
Oh yeah, you didn't know that.

01:49:16.040 --> 01:49:19.240
Well, I didn't think about it, but the ones that were getting me is when you have like

01:49:19.240 --> 01:49:25.360
up in your little top hand corner, the so-and-so sent you a big pile of poopy from Sorority

01:49:25.360 --> 01:49:26.360
Life.

01:49:26.360 --> 01:49:27.360
Yes.

01:49:27.360 --> 01:49:30.560
And I found, and the thing is, is that I've gone into my settings and blocked the application

01:49:30.560 --> 01:49:31.840
and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

01:49:31.840 --> 01:49:36.640
I have a real life, you know, and it still gives me those little invite things whenever

01:49:36.640 --> 01:49:39.100
people send me the shit I don't care about.

01:49:39.100 --> 01:49:44.580
So I found that you can go into the little thing there and then block the app from there.

01:49:44.580 --> 01:49:48.600
I actually do think I did send you a big pile of poop in Sorority Life the other day.

01:49:48.600 --> 01:49:50.200
So I'm surprised you're not using that too.

01:49:50.200 --> 01:49:52.160
Speaking of which, oh, I was going to say.

01:49:52.160 --> 01:49:54.800
I dropped that Sorority Life thing so fast.

01:49:54.800 --> 01:49:56.040
I did too, finally.

01:49:56.040 --> 01:49:57.040
I'm done with Sorority Life.

01:49:57.040 --> 01:50:03.480
My wife is online, probably playing Bejeweled Blitz.

01:50:03.480 --> 01:50:05.120
Good for her.

01:50:05.120 --> 01:50:09.800
And not listening to this show, because it's just games, games, games.

01:50:09.800 --> 01:50:10.800
Exactly.

01:50:10.800 --> 01:50:14.480
All right, moving on with more news, Dark Sakura.

01:50:14.480 --> 01:50:15.600
I don't want to.

01:50:15.600 --> 01:50:16.600
You have to.

01:50:16.600 --> 01:50:18.600
That's what we do here on the show.

01:50:18.600 --> 01:50:19.600
Okay.

01:50:19.600 --> 01:50:27.320
Apparently, Sony and Microsoft don't understand MMOs on a console.

01:50:27.320 --> 01:50:33.920
This actually was said in an interview from one of the people behind Star Trek Online

01:50:33.920 --> 01:50:40.000
that the reason the MMO is delayed is because of the business side of things.

01:50:40.000 --> 01:50:41.560
He says the game runs.

01:50:41.560 --> 01:50:42.840
The game is there.

01:50:42.840 --> 01:50:45.720
It runs all of their games.

01:50:45.720 --> 01:50:55.000
You know, like Champions Online, it runs almost, you know, pretty much all of their MMOs run

01:50:55.000 --> 01:50:56.000
on the console.

01:50:56.000 --> 01:51:01.880
It's just that they're trying to get Sony and Microsoft to understand how an MMO works

01:51:01.880 --> 01:51:04.400
and what helps it make its money.

01:51:04.400 --> 01:51:10.200
They said that the only ones to come close is maybe Final Fantasy XI and that they had

01:51:10.200 --> 01:51:14.600
to make a lot of exceptions.

01:51:14.600 --> 01:51:20.760
So Microsoft would, could establish a market share.

01:51:20.760 --> 01:51:29.480
I just, I'm like, you know, if you haven't, if, if you are a newbie to the world of MMOs,

01:51:29.480 --> 01:51:34.600
why don't you let the people who have done them before help you with your business model?

01:51:34.600 --> 01:51:37.320
Hey, it's worked for this.

01:51:37.320 --> 01:51:39.360
Why don't you do it this way?

01:51:39.360 --> 01:51:44.480
It's just, to me, I don't really see any reason why it can't be run like it is on the

01:51:44.480 --> 01:51:45.800
PC.

01:51:45.800 --> 01:51:50.040
You know, you buy your game, you pay your subscription fee.

01:51:50.040 --> 01:51:51.040
What's the big deal?

01:51:51.040 --> 01:51:55.920
Well, you know, there have been some MMOs on consoles, but you know, they also, like

01:51:55.920 --> 01:51:59.920
all the good ones I can think of were also on PC, like Final Fantasy XI, which might

01:51:59.920 --> 01:52:00.920
be the only console MMO.

01:52:00.920 --> 01:52:01.920
You said that's good?

01:52:01.920 --> 01:52:03.360
Well, you know, for its time, yes.

01:52:03.360 --> 01:52:06.240
Although Final Fantasy XIV, I'm all about that.

01:52:06.240 --> 01:52:07.240
Yes siree.

01:52:07.240 --> 01:52:11.120
I just still remember the day that you came over here to help me set up some of my stuff

01:52:11.120 --> 01:52:17.720
on Final Fantasy XI, and I was doing everything on a controller, done all my macros and everything,

01:52:17.720 --> 01:52:20.560
and you looked at me going, how the fuck are you doing that?

01:52:20.560 --> 01:52:22.800
I couldn't play that game with a controller.

01:52:22.800 --> 01:52:27.320
I realized it was made for the PS2, but I could not play that game with a controller.

01:52:27.320 --> 01:52:28.320
Unpossible.

01:52:28.320 --> 01:52:29.320
No, no.

01:52:29.320 --> 01:52:30.320
I was playing on the PC.

01:52:30.320 --> 01:52:31.320
I know.

01:52:31.320 --> 01:52:32.320
I know you were.

01:52:32.320 --> 01:52:33.320
I know you were.

01:52:33.320 --> 01:52:34.320
Because I've been playing PSO.

01:52:34.320 --> 01:52:35.320
And I thought you were a crackhead.

01:52:35.320 --> 01:52:37.780
But hey, I made that shit work.

01:52:37.780 --> 01:52:39.000
For the week you played, yes.

01:52:39.000 --> 01:52:40.000
No.

01:52:40.000 --> 01:52:41.320
That was when I was playing for a few months.

01:52:41.320 --> 01:52:45.760
I remember once we were in a party in the Valcrum Dunes, and you were, heal please.

01:52:45.760 --> 01:52:46.840
I was saying that to you.

01:52:46.840 --> 01:52:47.840
Heal please.

01:52:47.840 --> 01:52:49.840
And I was like, shut up please.

01:52:49.840 --> 01:52:57.640
But it really wasn't until I got to World of Warcraft that I had to actually learn how

01:52:57.640 --> 01:52:59.280
to play with a keyboard.

01:52:59.280 --> 01:53:00.280
Which sucks.

01:53:00.280 --> 01:53:02.520
I think MMOs are certainly possible on consoles.

01:53:02.520 --> 01:53:05.920
Like a console exclusive MMO, and I kind of wish they'd go for it.

01:53:05.920 --> 01:53:10.120
I think a game like Demon's Souls shows it's possible, even though that's not really an

01:53:10.120 --> 01:53:11.120
MMO.

01:53:11.120 --> 01:53:16.800
It is still a massively kind of multiplayer environment, it's just that the game doesn't

01:53:16.800 --> 01:53:18.440
revolve around the multiplayer.

01:53:18.440 --> 01:53:24.200
Well, I still, by the way, I'm gonna say to this day that I still wish that World of Warcraft

01:53:24.200 --> 01:53:28.640
had controller support, and that I'm looking for two months of play, please.

01:53:28.640 --> 01:53:30.800
Beg, beg, grovel, grovel.

01:53:30.800 --> 01:53:33.120
Not really.

01:53:33.120 --> 01:53:36.480
Then my paycheck situation fixes up.

01:53:36.480 --> 01:53:38.440
I dinged level 45 paladin today.

01:53:38.440 --> 01:53:39.440
Yay!

01:53:39.440 --> 01:53:41.360
You know what level my character got to?

01:53:41.360 --> 01:53:42.360
Seven.

01:53:42.360 --> 01:53:43.360
Yes, exactly.

01:53:43.360 --> 01:53:44.640
I know, you mentioned it two weeks ago.

01:53:44.640 --> 01:53:45.640
I know.

01:53:45.640 --> 01:53:47.640
And I haven't played in that long.

01:53:47.640 --> 01:53:49.160
Alright, anyhow, Loki.

01:53:49.160 --> 01:53:51.320
I haven't played any.

01:53:51.320 --> 01:53:53.200
You've never played World of Warcraft, huh?

01:53:53.200 --> 01:53:54.200
No.

01:53:54.200 --> 01:53:57.960
You sunk like three years, well you suck for one, but you sunk like three years of

01:53:57.960 --> 01:54:03.600
your life into Final Fantasy XI, and somehow never got sucked into World of Warcraft.

01:54:03.600 --> 01:54:04.960
It's amazing to me.

01:54:04.960 --> 01:54:07.800
This is what happens when Rob has a third a glass of wine.

01:54:07.800 --> 01:54:08.800
Apparently.

01:54:08.800 --> 01:54:10.400
Final Fantasy XIV, though, I...

01:54:10.400 --> 01:54:13.280
Well, it won't be okay to drive home.

01:54:13.280 --> 01:54:15.720
Final Fantasy XIV, though, I don't know.

01:54:15.720 --> 01:54:16.720
I can't make any promises.

01:54:16.720 --> 01:54:18.800
Final Fantasy XIV looks so sexy.

01:54:18.800 --> 01:54:23.840
I'm like, no, you can't do this now!

01:54:23.840 --> 01:54:26.400
I have a life, I've already moved on.

01:54:26.400 --> 01:54:30.280
If anything's going to cause a divorce, it's going to be Final Fantasy XIV.

01:54:30.280 --> 01:54:31.280
Alright.

01:54:31.280 --> 01:54:32.280
Anyhow.

01:54:32.280 --> 01:54:36.360
Alright, you better hope it has Bejeweled in it.

01:54:36.360 --> 01:54:37.360
For your wife.

01:54:37.360 --> 01:54:38.360
Well, hey, Bejeweled.

01:54:38.360 --> 01:54:42.360
I showed her the Bejeweled Square Enix game, you remember that?

01:54:42.360 --> 01:54:43.640
Oh, yeah.

01:54:43.640 --> 01:54:45.560
But it's Bejeweled Twist, she doesn't like Bejeweled Twist.

01:54:45.560 --> 01:54:48.360
She's like, ah, I know.

01:54:48.360 --> 01:54:49.360
Whatever.

01:54:49.360 --> 01:54:51.680
Um, so, Fifth Cell.

01:54:51.680 --> 01:54:55.980
They're looking to move on to some other platforms other than the Wii and DS.

01:54:55.980 --> 01:55:01.240
Their next game, which is pretty big, they say, and unannounced, will be for Xbox Live

01:55:01.240 --> 01:55:02.520
Arcade.

01:55:02.520 --> 01:55:06.000
And they go on saying, no, we're doing an Xbox Live Arcade title next, it's going to

01:55:06.000 --> 01:55:07.000
be pretty big.

01:55:07.000 --> 01:55:09.100
Wow, that's pretty generic.

01:55:09.100 --> 01:55:13.160
It's going to be really cool, we're very excited about it, and it's totally not ready to be

01:55:13.160 --> 01:55:14.160
announced.

01:55:14.160 --> 01:55:15.480
It's far away.

01:55:15.480 --> 01:55:18.440
I'm going to take a wild guess and say that it's probably going to look very similar to

01:55:18.440 --> 01:55:26.160
Draw on the Life and Scribblenauts, since both their games are very similar looking.

01:55:26.160 --> 01:55:29.200
I'm glad they're not doing the cheap Scribblenauts 2.

01:55:29.200 --> 01:55:31.560
In fact, I hope they never make a sequel to Scribblenauts.

01:55:31.560 --> 01:55:35.360
I would like to see more games that they just don't make sequels to.

01:55:35.360 --> 01:55:40.520
I know that sounds cruel, but, you know, sometimes these series get dug into the ground, you

01:55:40.520 --> 01:55:41.520
know?

01:55:41.520 --> 01:55:42.520
Like the Guardian Legend.

01:55:42.520 --> 01:55:43.520
No!

01:55:43.520 --> 01:55:44.780
That must have a sequel.

01:55:44.780 --> 01:55:48.560
That's one of those games where it's like, okay, 25 years later, we need a sequel to

01:55:48.560 --> 01:55:49.560
that.

01:55:49.560 --> 01:55:50.560
Or at least a remake.

01:55:50.560 --> 01:55:51.560
I mean, come on.

01:55:51.560 --> 01:55:52.560
A reimagining.

01:55:52.560 --> 01:55:54.120
How about a reimagining?

01:55:54.120 --> 01:55:57.680
I don't like the word remake as much as I do reimagining, because usually the reimagined

01:55:57.680 --> 01:55:59.720
games are better, so.

01:55:59.720 --> 01:56:03.200
Like the Silent Hill game on the Wii, which, that's out very soon, right?

01:56:03.200 --> 01:56:04.200
On November.

01:56:04.200 --> 01:56:06.200
Damn, they're going to miss Halloween?

01:56:06.200 --> 01:56:07.200
Stupids?

01:56:07.200 --> 01:56:09.200
Yeah, I got delayed.

01:56:09.200 --> 01:56:10.380
Stupids?

01:56:10.380 --> 01:56:12.120
Also stupid, in my opinion.

01:56:12.120 --> 01:56:15.840
Rock Band is on its way to the iPhone, and I don't get it.

01:56:15.840 --> 01:56:16.840
Like I do and I don't.

01:56:16.840 --> 01:56:17.840
It's like the PSP version.

01:56:17.840 --> 01:56:19.920
I under- well, no.

01:56:19.920 --> 01:56:20.920
Bite your tongue.

01:56:20.920 --> 01:56:23.660
The PSP version is amplitude or frequency.

01:56:23.660 --> 01:56:24.960
It is awesome.

01:56:24.960 --> 01:56:29.720
The iPhone version is just tap tap tap tap tap tap tap on your little screen.

01:56:29.720 --> 01:56:35.000
It's like Tap Tap Revenge, which is funny for the first few songs you play, but then

01:56:35.000 --> 01:56:36.280
kind of loses its point.

01:56:36.280 --> 01:56:40.640
I like Tap Tap Revenge because there were some good songs in it that I could play.

01:56:40.640 --> 01:56:41.640
That was it.

01:56:41.640 --> 01:56:44.240
But like Rock Band on the iPhone, okay, look, here it is.

01:56:44.240 --> 01:56:47.320
Before I give you my opinion, I should give you some of the facts.

01:56:47.320 --> 01:56:49.400
There is going to be a four-way multiplayer mode.

01:56:49.400 --> 01:56:54.000
It's all done over Bluetooth, and then you're going to have 20 games, which apparently are

01:56:54.000 --> 01:56:55.640
all in the actual game.

01:56:55.640 --> 01:56:59.160
And of course, since the iPhone will allow you to do microtransactions now, you can bet

01:56:59.160 --> 01:57:03.320
there's going to be downloadable songs in the future that you will be able to buy these

01:57:03.320 --> 01:57:06.120
song packs from EA Mobile.

01:57:06.120 --> 01:57:11.320
So basically, this is just Rock Band on your phone, and you can play drums with your fingers.

01:57:11.320 --> 01:57:14.680
And in my opinion, it's a little ridiculous, because you know what?

01:57:14.680 --> 01:57:18.360
They're going to charge kind of, you know, a high price for this.

01:57:18.360 --> 01:57:21.440
And there's some folks in chat that disagree with me.

01:57:21.440 --> 01:57:22.440
Tap Tap is rads.

01:57:22.440 --> 01:57:25.320
There's a couple people there, so.

01:57:25.320 --> 01:57:26.320
You know what?

01:57:26.320 --> 01:57:30.920
I probably won't ever get it because I'm still playing pickle.

01:57:30.920 --> 01:57:31.920
You know what I find?

01:57:31.920 --> 01:57:35.000
I've bought a lot of iPhone games that I just don't play.

01:57:35.000 --> 01:57:38.520
And maybe it goes back to that whole handheld gaming thing that I don't really care for

01:57:38.520 --> 01:57:39.680
handheld games usually.

01:57:39.680 --> 01:57:41.880
I don't really play them a lot.

01:57:41.880 --> 01:57:47.120
But I find that when I'm on my iPhone and I'm bored, I'm on Safari or Wikipedia or something.

01:57:47.120 --> 01:57:49.820
I'm never on the games, hardly ever.

01:57:49.820 --> 01:57:53.840
Here's what I have on mine, just for games left on here right now, is Peggle Cooking

01:57:53.840 --> 01:57:58.720
Mama Vi, which was the Sega CD RPG.

01:57:58.720 --> 01:58:06.440
I have the IMT Pain app.

01:58:06.440 --> 01:58:07.440
Let me tell you what I have.

01:58:07.440 --> 01:58:08.440
Click on Word of Day.

01:58:08.440 --> 01:58:09.440
That's fun.

01:58:09.440 --> 01:58:11.000
I have quite a few.

01:58:11.000 --> 01:58:18.240
DDRS, Tap Tap Revenge 2, Word Fu, Labyrinth, Wild West, Silent Hill the Escape, Aurora

01:58:18.240 --> 01:58:25.360
Faint the Arena, Pinball Dreams, Peggle, Columns Deluxe, Infinity Gene Space Invaders, Civilization

01:58:25.360 --> 01:58:33.160
Revolution, and Luminous Light, which if you listen to the mini show from last week, is

01:58:33.160 --> 01:58:35.340
the most horrible adaptation of Luminous.

01:58:35.340 --> 01:58:37.320
It's an aberration of a Luminous game.

01:58:37.320 --> 01:58:41.840
I've also had a Light Cycle game, remember, I had my Light Cycle game for a while, and

01:58:41.840 --> 01:58:45.520
I did get Katamari, which I just didn't think was as much fun as I'd hoped it would have

01:58:45.520 --> 01:58:46.520
been on the iPhone.

01:58:46.520 --> 01:58:53.480
And I had Pole Position Remix, which was pretty fun, but mostly, you know, what I've been

01:58:53.480 --> 01:58:54.480
playing on here.

01:58:54.480 --> 01:58:56.120
I tried Pac-Man when I didn't think it was fun.

01:58:56.120 --> 01:58:59.080
I just think the touch controls kind of suck.

01:58:59.080 --> 01:59:00.080
Like I'm just kind of done with it.

01:59:00.080 --> 01:59:01.080
Except for Peggle.

01:59:01.080 --> 01:59:02.920
Yeah, they make it work for Peggle.

01:59:02.920 --> 01:59:03.920
I will give you that.

01:59:03.920 --> 01:59:07.400
It's actually a lot of fun to play Peggle on the iPhone.

01:59:07.400 --> 01:59:08.720
That would be like the first game I would ever play.

01:59:08.720 --> 01:59:10.600
Oh yeah, I have my Solid Tear game.

01:59:10.600 --> 01:59:13.240
I had a good Sudoku game, too.

01:59:13.240 --> 01:59:16.840
Well, anyhow, Rock Band's coming to the iPhone, and I don't care.

01:59:16.840 --> 01:59:18.000
But maybe you do.

01:59:18.000 --> 01:59:20.760
I'm sure there will be plenty of folks that download this, they're not gonna have a problem

01:59:20.760 --> 01:59:24.800
selling this, but there you go.

01:59:24.800 --> 01:59:30.000
Anyhow, let's get into the part of the show that is all about you guys, and the emails

01:59:30.000 --> 01:59:34.720
that you send us every week to Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

01:59:34.720 --> 01:59:36.720
It's our Orange Lounge Radio Mailbag segment.

01:59:36.720 --> 01:59:38.840
I know, I'm excited, too.

01:59:38.840 --> 01:59:43.200
Dark Soccer's gonna jump in head first in the email bag, and pull out some emails to

01:59:43.200 --> 01:59:44.200
read.

01:59:44.200 --> 01:59:48.040
I doubt it's very full this week, as we didn't have a show last week, really.

01:59:48.040 --> 01:59:49.240
Well, we had a pre-taped show.

01:59:49.240 --> 01:59:50.520
We had a number.

01:59:50.520 --> 01:59:51.720
A tiny show.

01:59:51.720 --> 01:59:55.120
Anyway, this comes from Slapshot, I'm gonna guess.

01:59:55.120 --> 02:00:00.800
Hey guys, I know you probably won't read this on this show because of the content, but I

02:00:00.800 --> 02:00:05.360
have a question about trying out, quote, Sims 3.

02:00:05.360 --> 02:00:10.240
Everything has installed fine, and I'm using Magic Disc for my ISO.

02:00:10.240 --> 02:00:11.240
I see.

02:00:11.240 --> 02:00:13.240
Yeah, I'm gonna go ahead and do it online, I don't care.

02:00:13.240 --> 02:00:17.440
After Sims 3 loads up, it gives me the error saying I don't have a disc in my drive.

02:00:17.440 --> 02:00:18.440
Any suggestions?

02:00:18.440 --> 02:00:21.600
Thanks a lot.

02:00:21.600 --> 02:00:22.600
I have a suggestion.

02:00:22.600 --> 02:00:23.600
Buy the game.

02:00:23.600 --> 02:00:24.600
Buy the game.

02:00:24.600 --> 02:00:25.600
That'll fix it.

02:00:25.600 --> 02:00:29.480
Having a physical disc would probably be advisable.

02:00:29.480 --> 02:00:35.200
I don't mean to give you shit, but when you decide to pirate games, getting low quality

02:00:35.200 --> 02:00:39.440
and crap like this happening to you is exactly what you sign up for.

02:00:39.440 --> 02:00:45.360
So like, if this were fmylife.com, I'd be clicking you deserved it right now.

02:00:45.360 --> 02:00:49.520
So sorry I don't have any real advice for you, but you know what, here comes a point

02:00:49.520 --> 02:00:54.720
where we have to say, enough piracy is enough, and do it just buy the game.

02:00:54.720 --> 02:00:59.160
I'm sorry, I was actually suddenly looking at the back of the box.

02:00:59.160 --> 02:01:04.360
Yeah, because my Sims 3 box is like sitting here on my desk because I keep the game in

02:01:04.360 --> 02:01:08.280
my damn drive and take it out to burn DVDs, so.

02:01:08.280 --> 02:01:10.840
Who else has seen the back of your box?

02:01:10.840 --> 02:01:17.880
Look, oooh, Rob, it's my box, it's green.

02:01:17.880 --> 02:01:20.720
Look, my box has a car.

02:01:20.720 --> 02:01:23.720
I need to see a doctor.

02:01:23.720 --> 02:01:24.720
Next email, quick.

02:01:24.720 --> 02:01:26.720
Give me a doctor!

02:01:26.720 --> 02:01:27.720
No, okay.

02:01:27.720 --> 02:01:32.320
Um, this is from our buddy Rob-ba-ba.

02:01:32.320 --> 02:01:36.320
Although this is not podcast material, I just wanted to share about my first trip to Disneyland.

02:01:36.320 --> 02:01:38.200
Oh, it's podcast material.

02:01:38.200 --> 02:01:40.000
I can see why you guys love it so much.

02:01:40.000 --> 02:01:43.280
The Nightmare Before Christmas Haunted Mansion was amazing and worth a trip alone.

02:01:43.280 --> 02:01:48.200
I also noticed that your Pirates of the Caribbean ride has the same basic components, but it

02:01:48.200 --> 02:01:49.200
is just plain better.

02:01:49.200 --> 02:01:52.600
Well, that's because we have two drops on ours.

02:01:52.600 --> 02:01:57.000
You know, the one over in Florida has one drop.

02:01:57.000 --> 02:02:01.880
Sorry, we just had a feed drop in our stage, so I was talking to the chatters.

02:02:01.880 --> 02:02:02.880
What is this about?

02:02:02.880 --> 02:02:03.880
I'm sorry.

02:02:03.880 --> 02:02:04.880
Um, it's Disneyland.

02:02:04.880 --> 02:02:05.880
Oh, yay!

02:02:05.880 --> 02:02:06.880
Rob-ba-ba.

02:02:06.880 --> 02:02:07.880
That's right, he went.

02:02:07.880 --> 02:02:11.600
He went the one week I didn't go, because I went and then I stayed here a week and then

02:02:11.600 --> 02:02:13.560
I went again, and he was there the week I was home.

02:02:13.560 --> 02:02:17.920
Well, going forward, I love California Adventure too, so I looked it up on Google Maps and

02:02:17.920 --> 02:02:22.400
saw something cool in the lagoon, which still had water in the picture.

02:02:22.400 --> 02:02:27.000
There appears to be an earthquake happening based on the interference pattern on the surface.

02:02:27.000 --> 02:02:31.280
A normal lagoon of that size would normally have small irregular waves, not evenly spaced

02:02:31.280 --> 02:02:37.960
in consistent wave patterns, except that they, um, the lagoon water is filtered and runs

02:02:37.960 --> 02:02:45.200
through cyclically, so, well, it did, when they had one, so, because I've actually got

02:02:45.200 --> 02:02:52.040
to peek in the lagoon now that it's, um, dumped out and they're redoing shit, so, but yeah.

02:02:52.040 --> 02:02:55.920
Actually I love looking at, just look at Disneyland over on Google Maps, that's pretty cool.

02:02:55.920 --> 02:02:57.640
It's kind of fun to go on a virtual tour of Disneyland.

02:02:57.640 --> 02:03:01.420
I love Google Maps just to go on virtual tours of just about anything, but I'm really glad

02:03:01.420 --> 02:03:05.800
to hear Rob-ba-ba had fun at Disneyland, because it is a fun place.

02:03:05.800 --> 02:03:09.520
I'm hoping to go one more time before my season pass expires.

02:03:09.520 --> 02:03:13.720
And this is, now I keep forgetting if we said it was Shook, I think you said Shook.

02:03:13.720 --> 02:03:14.720
I think it is Shook.

02:03:14.720 --> 02:03:15.720
Okay.

02:03:15.720 --> 02:03:16.720
Hello, OLR.

02:03:16.720 --> 02:03:19.720
First off, I'd like to say that my fight with my father is over.

02:03:19.720 --> 02:03:20.720
Yay!

02:03:20.720 --> 02:03:23.760
Wait, I thought it was resolved in a previous episode of OLR.

02:03:23.760 --> 02:03:24.760
Alright, whatever.

02:03:24.760 --> 02:03:26.440
His dad took the game away, remember?

02:03:26.440 --> 02:03:28.000
Yeah, but I thought they made up.

02:03:28.000 --> 02:03:29.000
Alright, anyway.

02:03:29.000 --> 02:03:32.240
I talked to him quoting you guys, I hope he didn't quote the kind of rude stuff that we

02:03:32.240 --> 02:03:33.240
said, because, anyway.

02:03:33.240 --> 02:03:36.240
But he seemed understanding for once.

02:03:36.240 --> 02:03:40.240
He tried playing Final Fantasy X, and he actually seemed to love it, most notably the metal

02:03:40.240 --> 02:03:41.240
music.

02:03:41.240 --> 02:03:42.320
Now, on to the main story.

02:03:42.320 --> 02:03:47.440
I was in gym class playing American football when an idiot in my class fouls the ball.

02:03:47.440 --> 02:03:51.400
He runs over to the ball and starts teabagging the ball.

02:03:51.400 --> 02:03:53.920
Let that sink in.

02:03:53.920 --> 02:03:56.440
I swear to God we read this email the week you weren't here.

02:03:56.440 --> 02:03:57.440
Did you?

02:03:57.440 --> 02:04:00.280
But I'm looking at the date that email was received, and it was Friday, I wonder if dude

02:04:00.280 --> 02:04:01.280
sent the email twice.

02:04:01.280 --> 02:04:03.920
Oh, well, if you already read it, then.

02:04:03.920 --> 02:04:04.920
Go ahead and finish.

02:04:04.920 --> 02:04:06.160
Is it about the lewd sexual behavior?

02:04:06.160 --> 02:04:07.160
Yeah, you weren't here.

02:04:07.160 --> 02:04:08.160
Go ahead.

02:04:08.160 --> 02:04:09.160
You can put your opinion on it.

02:04:09.160 --> 02:04:11.120
No, no, if you already read it, then.

02:04:11.120 --> 02:04:12.120
I could be wrong.

02:04:12.120 --> 02:04:13.120
I don't know.

02:04:13.120 --> 02:04:14.920
Chatters, does this email sound familiar?

02:04:14.920 --> 02:04:19.360
That's why I said I could swear we had a resolution on the, um, but maybe he re-sent it, because

02:04:19.360 --> 02:04:22.280
the podcast feed hasn't gotten updated in a while, so maybe he didn't hear it.

02:04:22.280 --> 02:04:25.620
Alright, well, the coach grabs him by the neck, drags him inside, screaming, you little

02:04:25.620 --> 02:04:27.300
son of a bitch.

02:04:27.300 --> 02:04:33.240
If idiot was suspended for lewd sexual behavior, it just goes to show how far gaming has taken

02:04:33.240 --> 02:04:34.720
us in society.

02:04:34.720 --> 02:04:39.840
Is it true- it truly is the shit like this that gives us good gamers a bad stereotyped

02:04:39.840 --> 02:04:41.240
name.

02:04:41.240 --> 02:04:45.400
Was it re- what really pisses me the hell off slash rant.

02:04:45.400 --> 02:04:46.400
You're truly shook.

02:04:46.400 --> 02:04:51.360
Uh, PS, a few weeks ago, Juan ranted about old people not wearing bras.

02:04:51.360 --> 02:04:52.360
He was right.

02:04:52.360 --> 02:04:57.920
A little bag of an English teacher let out a knit- a knit slip in front of everyone.

02:04:57.920 --> 02:04:58.920
Gag.

02:04:58.920 --> 02:04:59.920
Ew!

02:04:59.920 --> 02:05:03.240
You've got a fucked up school, dude.

02:05:03.240 --> 02:05:06.360
Your English teachers are showing their ta-tas and your gym teachers are throwing people

02:05:06.360 --> 02:05:09.220
against the wall, calling them sons of bitches, like, seriously?

02:05:09.220 --> 02:05:10.220
Go to private school?

02:05:10.220 --> 02:05:18.140
Well, first of all, the behavior was- Tell your dad we said that, too.

02:05:18.140 --> 02:05:25.080
The behavior of the, uh, idiot playing football was indeed unnecessary and deserved punishment,

02:05:25.080 --> 02:05:27.320
but- Has nothing to do with games.

02:05:27.320 --> 02:05:29.180
Yeah, that has nothing to do with games.

02:05:29.180 --> 02:05:36.120
The coach, however, seriously, uh, needed to, uh, also be suspended at least for a game

02:05:36.120 --> 02:05:41.760
or have, uh, you know, some sort of probationary measure taken.

02:05:41.760 --> 02:05:45.480
And then, um, your English teacher does need to wear a better bra.

02:05:45.480 --> 02:05:51.240
This sounds like the high school in Glee, like, only, like, random shit happens.

02:05:51.240 --> 02:05:54.560
What- You've got an interesting life- None of that ever happened at- at mine except

02:05:54.560 --> 02:06:02.760
for one teacher accidentally, um, ripping his, um, pants in, um, I always tell his underwear

02:06:02.760 --> 02:06:03.760
but still.

02:06:03.760 --> 02:06:08.660
Shook, I hope you're writing all this down so that you can write an epic autobiography

02:06:08.660 --> 02:06:09.660
someday.

02:06:09.660 --> 02:06:11.080
A memoir, if you will.

02:06:11.080 --> 02:06:14.240
Dude, sell it to a reality show or something.

02:06:14.240 --> 02:06:16.240
Of course, you know I won't watch it.

02:06:16.240 --> 02:06:17.240
Um.

02:06:17.240 --> 02:06:18.720
You're so kind.

02:06:18.720 --> 02:06:21.920
I don't watch, like, a reality show, sorry, you know.

02:06:21.920 --> 02:06:25.040
Um, okay, this next one comes from, uh, SonicM88.

02:06:25.040 --> 02:06:26.600
Hello, O.L.R.!

02:06:26.600 --> 02:06:27.600
Hi.

02:06:27.600 --> 02:06:28.600
Bling, bling.

02:06:28.600 --> 02:06:33.280
I was just responding.

02:06:33.280 --> 02:06:35.320
I miss you guys a ton.

02:06:35.320 --> 02:06:38.880
I haven't- Wow, a ton, that's two thousand pounds.

02:06:38.880 --> 02:06:43.200
I haven't been able to listen to you guys for ever- several months for complicated reasons

02:06:43.200 --> 02:06:45.960
but I needed to let you guys know something.

02:06:45.960 --> 02:06:49.900
Rob, I remember way back in an old podcast you used to talk about how much you loved

02:06:49.900 --> 02:06:51.960
Alanis Morissette in Rock Band 2.

02:06:51.960 --> 02:06:56.240
Well, as I'm sure you know, two additional Alanis Morissette songs came as downloadable

02:06:56.240 --> 02:06:57.240
content.

02:06:57.240 --> 02:06:58.240
What?

02:06:58.240 --> 02:06:59.240
Really?

02:06:59.240 --> 02:07:04.200
I was probably just as stoked as you were to hear that they were coming out-

02:07:04.200 --> 02:07:05.200
You lie!

02:07:05.200 --> 02:07:09.880
So I bought them as soon as I could and for you I decided to get first place on both of

02:07:09.880 --> 02:07:11.840
them, Ironic and Head Over Feet, on vocals.

02:07:11.840 --> 02:07:15.960
Wait a minute, wait a minute, hold on, Loki, Alanis' tracks came out on Rock Band?

02:07:15.960 --> 02:07:17.960
I miss this.

02:07:17.960 --> 02:07:18.960
There may have been some.

02:07:18.960 --> 02:07:21.040
You know what, we didn't cover Rock Band releases last week because we didn't have

02:07:21.040 --> 02:07:22.040
a show.

02:07:22.040 --> 02:07:23.040
Yeah.

02:07:23.040 --> 02:07:24.040
Maybe it did happen.

02:07:24.040 --> 02:07:25.040
Chatters?

02:07:25.040 --> 02:07:26.040
Did I really miss that?

02:07:26.040 --> 02:07:27.040
Can I continue?

02:07:27.040 --> 02:07:28.040
Yeah.

02:07:28.040 --> 02:07:29.040
Figure is the one week that you don't do it.

02:07:29.040 --> 02:07:30.040
I know, right?

02:07:30.040 --> 02:07:38.760
As of this posting I'm still first on Xbox 360 leaderboards, gamertag LucasPones8907.

02:07:38.760 --> 02:07:43.080
He sends a follow up email though.

02:07:43.080 --> 02:07:46.840
It seems someone's taken my first place on Head Over Feet but I'm working hard for first

02:07:46.840 --> 02:07:48.080
again for you, Rob.

02:07:48.080 --> 02:07:52.400
I'm still first on Ironic though but maybe I shouldn't say that or I'll jinx my score

02:07:52.400 --> 02:07:53.400
again.

02:07:53.400 --> 02:07:55.960
Dude, I'll play expert with you or something and we'll take over the leaderboards.

02:07:55.960 --> 02:07:59.760
I did not know that was- now I gotta get my Xbox 360 back.

02:07:59.760 --> 02:08:03.160
There you go, you asked earlier what it would take to get my 360 back.

02:08:03.160 --> 02:08:05.120
What's gonna light the fire under Rob's ass?

02:08:05.120 --> 02:08:06.320
Alanis and Rock Band, there you go.

02:08:06.320 --> 02:08:09.680
Hey, you know what lit the fire under your ass for PS3?

02:08:09.680 --> 02:08:10.680
Abba!

02:08:10.680 --> 02:08:15.640
Oh yeah, SingStar Abba, yeah, that was a big seller too.

02:08:15.640 --> 02:08:16.640
Which I still play.

02:08:16.640 --> 02:08:20.800
You need to play some Beatles Rock Band with me.

02:08:20.800 --> 02:08:22.680
I did pretty damn good, okay?

02:08:22.680 --> 02:08:25.640
I blame you now for me playing Beatles Rock Band.

02:08:25.640 --> 02:08:26.640
So there is-

02:08:26.640 --> 02:08:27.720
Getting me up there making me sing.

02:08:27.720 --> 02:08:31.760
There is much more to the cast of Orange Lounge Radio than just video games and I will say,

02:08:31.760 --> 02:08:38.720
I am not ashamed to admit I'm a huge Alanis Morissette fan and that was my musical muse

02:08:38.720 --> 02:08:41.000
in high school, like for real.

02:08:41.000 --> 02:08:47.180
Did you actually watch the video that I posted on Facebook a while back which was the metaphor

02:08:47.180 --> 02:08:51.160
free radio thing from College Humor?

02:08:51.160 --> 02:08:52.640
Was that the-

02:08:52.640 --> 02:08:53.640
The guy sitting in the car?

02:08:53.640 --> 02:08:54.640
Turn around?

02:08:54.640 --> 02:08:55.640
No, I didn't see that one.

02:08:55.640 --> 02:08:56.640
No.

02:08:56.640 --> 02:08:58.040
I saw the total eclipse of the heart little video.

02:08:58.040 --> 02:09:02.680
It was basically a guy listening to his radio says, and now on Sublight Radio we have metaphor

02:09:02.680 --> 02:09:07.640
free radio and then it was all these songs doing like literally what the songs mean and

02:09:07.640 --> 02:09:14.720
the Alanis part was, I hate you Dave Coulier.

02:09:14.720 --> 02:09:18.120
Shut the front door, Tiger Claw just linked me to rockband.com.

02:09:18.120 --> 02:09:22.160
Sure enough, this happened on October 2nd, this would have been the week we weren't here.

02:09:22.160 --> 02:09:23.160
This was last week.

02:09:23.160 --> 02:09:27.920
That's just what goes to show if we miss a session.

02:09:27.920 --> 02:09:30.800
Electric Six and Flowbots.

02:09:30.800 --> 02:09:33.600
Oh my God, Gaybar by Electric Six is in rockband.

02:09:33.600 --> 02:09:34.600
That song is awesome.

02:09:34.600 --> 02:09:35.600
Sweet.

02:09:35.600 --> 02:09:39.340
You, I want to take you to a gaybar.

02:09:39.340 --> 02:09:40.340
That song is rad.

02:09:40.340 --> 02:09:42.440
Dude, we missed an awesome week.

02:09:42.440 --> 02:09:45.120
Do you have that on your computer, Rob?

02:09:45.120 --> 02:09:53.140
I do, but iTunes will slow things down significantly, however, this is why we have such wonderful

02:09:53.140 --> 02:09:57.000
things like YouTube so that when you're in the middle of a radio show, you can actually

02:09:57.000 --> 02:10:04.000
just pull it up and you can actually get the song.

02:10:04.000 --> 02:10:30.240
Why is War censored on YouTube?

02:10:30.240 --> 02:10:36.040
Is that because it's Abraham Lincoln wearing no pants and you can't say more?

02:10:36.040 --> 02:10:47.840
On a spin bike at that.

02:10:47.840 --> 02:10:51.440
Tell me you do not want to play this in rockband right the fuck now.

02:10:51.440 --> 02:10:52.440
Seriously.

02:10:52.440 --> 02:11:04.200
After the show, YouTube that immediately, it's hilarity.

02:11:04.200 --> 02:11:05.200
It really is.

02:11:05.200 --> 02:11:07.880
That song is awesome.

02:11:07.880 --> 02:11:13.200
Anyhow, thank you, emailer, for alerting us to such awesomeness in rockband that we missed

02:11:13.200 --> 02:11:14.200
the week of...

02:11:14.200 --> 02:11:15.200
Ironically enough...

02:11:15.200 --> 02:11:17.480
Rob is throwing up the horns, but he's doing it wrong.

02:11:17.480 --> 02:11:21.360
Ironically enough, the week of gay days at Disneyland.

02:11:21.360 --> 02:11:26.520
Rob is throwing up the horns the wrong way, because really, that's too much metal for

02:11:26.520 --> 02:11:29.240
one hand.

02:11:29.240 --> 02:11:30.640
Too much metal at the gay bar.

02:11:30.640 --> 02:11:36.240
All right, anyhow, let's move on to the FUs of the week, which I sadly don't really have

02:11:36.240 --> 02:11:39.640
a story to inspire tonight.

02:11:39.640 --> 02:11:42.120
So we're just going to get into the FUs of the week.

02:11:42.120 --> 02:11:46.180
I thought there was something in our show about a lawsuit, but I guess maybe it was

02:11:46.180 --> 02:11:49.200
something I cut out accidentally, whatever.

02:11:49.200 --> 02:11:50.600
It's one of those nights tonight.

02:11:50.600 --> 02:11:55.960
I've been drinking wine, and now I have gay bar on repeat in my head, and now Loki's singing

02:11:55.960 --> 02:11:57.960
it over there.

02:11:57.960 --> 02:11:58.960
I just said one line.

02:11:58.960 --> 02:11:59.960
All right, anyhow.

02:11:59.960 --> 02:12:00.960
Here come the FUs of the week.

02:12:00.960 --> 02:12:01.960
A chance for a little angst in your life.

02:12:01.960 --> 02:12:02.960
Oh, this is bad.

02:12:02.960 --> 02:12:03.960
Here is justice.

02:12:03.960 --> 02:12:04.960
Here is punishment.

02:12:04.960 --> 02:12:05.960
Here...

02:12:05.960 --> 02:12:06.960
This is fucked up.

02:12:06.960 --> 02:12:29.320
Um, FU to EDD and other disability things for the lovely gap in my paycheck, which has

02:12:29.320 --> 02:12:34.840
not been fun because, you know, I like to have money with which to pay my bills.

02:12:34.840 --> 02:12:42.840
I really like being able to pay my bills because, you know, it means that I can eat and have

02:12:42.840 --> 02:12:47.880
a place to live without, you know, feeling completely guilty for, you know, taking advantage

02:12:47.880 --> 02:12:54.040
of my friend's generosity, and, you know, and there's also this, you know, wonderful

02:12:54.040 --> 02:12:58.160
concept, Rob, of power and internet.

02:12:58.160 --> 02:12:59.160
I love them.

02:12:59.160 --> 02:13:01.160
Love them both.

02:13:01.160 --> 02:13:05.840
I would seriously go without eating before I didn't pay the internet bill.

02:13:05.840 --> 02:13:10.440
Honestly, I realize my priorities are fucked, but...

02:13:10.440 --> 02:13:11.440
I'll put it this way.

02:13:11.440 --> 02:13:18.460
I found food in my fridge that I didn't even know existed, and then once we got a little

02:13:18.460 --> 02:13:26.720
bit of a break thanks to me getting some massage work in, thanks to having a very good generous

02:13:26.720 --> 02:13:32.400
friend and, uh, thanks to a little bit of a break on our rent, so we actually were able

02:13:32.400 --> 02:13:34.400
to go get groceries and get some of our bills paid.

02:13:34.400 --> 02:13:35.920
I might take you out for a massage, by the way.

02:13:35.920 --> 02:13:37.920
I can use one if you're still giving them out.

02:13:37.920 --> 02:13:38.920
Fifty bucks?

02:13:38.920 --> 02:13:39.920
I might actually go for it.

02:13:39.920 --> 02:13:40.920
For an hour?

02:13:40.920 --> 02:13:41.920
For an hour.

02:13:41.920 --> 02:13:42.920
Hmm.

02:13:42.920 --> 02:13:43.920
I might do it.

02:13:43.920 --> 02:13:44.920
I might have friends that are interested too if you really want.

02:13:44.920 --> 02:13:47.920
As long as they won't report me for not having my business license.

02:13:47.920 --> 02:13:48.920
Oh.

02:13:48.920 --> 02:13:53.320
Well, I don't know about that, but, you know, I can't do T.A. there.

02:13:53.320 --> 02:13:54.320
No.

02:13:54.320 --> 02:13:55.320
Rob.

02:13:55.320 --> 02:13:56.320
Rob.

02:13:56.320 --> 02:13:57.320
Rob.

02:13:57.320 --> 02:13:58.320
Yeah, but I'll charge for that.

02:13:58.320 --> 02:13:59.320
Wink.

02:13:59.320 --> 02:14:00.320
Wink.

02:14:00.320 --> 02:14:01.320
Okay.

02:14:01.320 --> 02:14:02.320
Wink.

02:14:02.320 --> 02:14:03.320
Wink.

02:14:03.320 --> 02:14:04.320
Wink.

02:14:04.320 --> 02:14:05.320
Wink.

02:14:05.320 --> 02:14:06.320
Wink.

02:14:06.320 --> 02:14:07.320
IGH.

02:14:07.320 --> 02:14:11.320
// Humane

02:14:11.320 --> 02:14:12.120
F.e. to the guy.

02:14:12.120 --> 02:14:13.320
It's actually kind of my fault.

02:14:13.320 --> 02:14:19.300
F.e. to me, answering the door to my house because every time I do, it's always somebody

02:14:19.300 --> 02:14:24.340
is trying to sell me something and, for some reason, I end up getting roped into buying

02:14:24.340 --> 02:14:25.340
something.

02:14:25.340 --> 02:14:27.940
It was actually a guy coming up to quote us for a new roof

02:14:27.940 --> 02:14:30.340
Which is fine cuz we needed that and I wanted to quote for a new roof

02:14:30.420 --> 02:14:33.820
But he sat there and talked to us for two hours, and that was just unacceptable

02:14:33.820 --> 02:14:36.500
I just wanted him to give me a damn price because I knew it was gonna be expensive anyways

02:14:36.780 --> 02:14:40.540
But he sat there and talked about how his roofing system is the most

02:14:40.940 --> 02:14:46.180
Awesome thing in the world, and I really don't give a crap because I was in the middle of soldering for my new cabinet

02:14:47.140 --> 02:14:49.140
And you don't interrupt that

02:14:49.140 --> 02:14:53.900
Um f you to something I didn't bring up earlier in the show

02:14:54.100 --> 02:14:58.980
But f you to the fact that my world of warcraft account got hacked this week while I was on vacation

02:14:58.980 --> 02:15:03.780
I got a call Monday morning for my buddy Shane who said that all my characters were logging in and out of Ravencrest

02:15:03.780 --> 02:15:07.540
And I said boy, that's really funny because I'm not playing the game right now in fact

02:15:07.540 --> 02:15:11.340
I'm in Los Angeles turns out my password was stolen and my account was hacked

02:15:12.140 --> 02:15:18.820
Which makes me feel very vulnerable because if they have my wow password what else do they have now granted?

02:15:18.820 --> 02:15:22.540
I removed an authenticator from my account which yes, you might think is stupid

02:15:22.540 --> 02:15:27.420
But the keychain broke so I was gonna lose that authenticator if I didn't remove my account

02:15:27.420 --> 02:15:32.100
So they could've stolen my password from my ex-boyfriend's computer, or maybe his was insecure

02:15:32.100 --> 02:15:32.660
I don't know

02:15:32.660 --> 02:15:36.100
But all I know is that it makes me very nervous to know that I have passwords stolen

02:15:36.100 --> 02:15:42.580
So I had to go change all of my passwords and everything to Blizzard's credit very nice customer service even though

02:15:42.580 --> 02:15:47.220
It took me forever to get through like they had a 30-minute hold time Monday morning

02:15:47.220 --> 02:15:51.260
And I even called like right before close, and I still had to wait 18 minutes before I got a representative

02:15:51.260 --> 02:15:56.460
But to be fair she was very nice did everything she was supposed to do I trained customer service for call centers

02:15:56.460 --> 02:15:57.660
I'm always very

02:15:57.660 --> 02:16:02.860
Scrutinizing those people she was a very good rep and I got an email from a lady that was very nice at Blizzard too

02:16:02.980 --> 02:16:04.700
The GM's fixed my stuff

02:16:04.700 --> 02:16:10.300
It's probably the whole thing took about three to four days, but fuck you to people who steal passwords, and I've decided

02:16:10.820 --> 02:16:13.740
I'm completely against people buying gold and wow at this point

02:16:13.740 --> 02:16:20.460
You know why because you only encourage these assholes to do what they do so if you buy wow and or if you buy gold and

02:16:20.460 --> 02:16:22.460
Wow fuck you

02:16:24.620 --> 02:16:26.220
There you go

02:16:26.220 --> 02:16:32.040
X link in chat says wow rape damn. Yes. I feel like I was raped in the face by a

02:16:32.820 --> 02:16:37.420
Warcraft hacker Lumi's in chat says Rob. I had to wait an hour and a half on Friday morning

02:16:37.420 --> 02:16:40.220
I should get everything restored in two to four days well sadly

02:16:40.220 --> 02:16:44.500
I guess it wasn't just I mean I'm glad to hear it wasn't just me, but at the same time that really sucks

02:16:44.900 --> 02:16:48.020
Yeah, it takes a couple days to get everything restored see now the good news was I

02:16:48.580 --> 02:16:50.020
Wasn't really playing on that server

02:16:50.020 --> 02:16:51.380
I was playing on a different server

02:16:51.380 --> 02:16:56.620
But right around the same time my wow account got hacked and I got home was when I was really getting into demon souls

02:16:56.620 --> 02:16:58.900
so I wasn't really missing Wow anyway, but

02:16:59.420 --> 02:17:01.420
It still sucks

02:17:01.740 --> 02:17:03.380
bar

02:17:03.380 --> 02:17:05.380
by the way

02:17:05.460 --> 02:17:09.620
The story I was going to read to lead into the F use tonight for some reason I forgot to link it

02:17:09.620 --> 02:17:11.620
There was a dude that got

02:17:12.100 --> 02:17:16.380
Banned from the Sony PlayStation Network, and he was gonna file a lawsuit

02:17:16.380 --> 02:17:19.420
Or he did file a lawsuit saying that his first amendment rights were breached

02:17:20.020 --> 02:17:25.180
Well, and what's wrong with this picture? Can your first amendment rights really be breached when you're banned from the PlayStation Network?

02:17:26.060 --> 02:17:29.060
No, cuz bright PlayStation Network is a private network

02:17:29.060 --> 02:17:32.500
And that's exactly what a judge Ronald M

02:17:32.500 --> 02:17:39.500
White said in a federal court in the Northern District of California earlier this week is that there was no plausible first of amendment cause and

02:17:39.860 --> 02:17:45.460
Throughout the lawsuit but interesting from some of the commenters here on Kotaku where I saw this story

02:17:45.460 --> 02:17:50.540
I thought a really good point that was brought up by one of the commenters is that but when you buy stuff on PlayStation Network

02:17:50.620 --> 02:17:52.900
It's tied to your login name

02:17:52.900 --> 02:17:58.660
So if you suddenly get banned from Wow, not only do you use your act lose your access you lose everything you bought

02:17:58.660 --> 02:18:03.780
That is kind of messed up in a way. Although granted. I mean if you did something really bad

02:18:03.780 --> 02:18:09.820
Maybe you had it coming. It's also in the terms of service and you have to read that but that is that shady

02:18:09.820 --> 02:18:11.820
That's a little shady throw all this money

02:18:13.100 --> 02:18:18.660
It's an incentive for him not to be a douchebag now what is kind of messed up and yeah

02:18:18.660 --> 02:18:25.340
You may not understand you realize it like for example the PlayStation Network forums, you know where it's tied to your account

02:18:25.340 --> 02:18:30.860
you get banned from the forums you get banned from PlayStation Network, which is kind of shady because you know

02:18:30.860 --> 02:18:35.900
You may not realize that but once again read your terms of service Wow and don't be a douchebag

02:18:36.140 --> 02:18:39.300
Yeah, I mean I agree with don't be a douchebag and maybe he had it coming in a way

02:18:39.300 --> 02:18:43.100
But at the same time like what if a mistake happens because you know, like I you know

02:18:43.100 --> 02:18:44.860
I'm comparing apples to oranges here

02:18:44.860 --> 02:18:46.960
But on the Xbox side of things if you get banned

02:18:46.960 --> 02:18:49.580
There's no way to contest it which I think it's kind of fucked up

02:18:49.580 --> 02:18:53.480
Like I think there should be a way you can contest it especially if it's like not you

02:18:53.480 --> 02:18:58.820
I mean you are responsible for your account that it added up but after getting hacked in Wow and

02:18:59.180 --> 02:19:04.860
Seriously, I'm not an idiot on the computer. Okay, like I know what sites I'm logging into

02:19:05.220 --> 02:19:07.740
I'm not you know, I'd like to think I'm not an idiot

02:19:07.740 --> 02:19:12.900
so I'm kind of shocked that this happened to me and that was really alarming because I

02:19:13.640 --> 02:19:18.740
Don't do stupid things on my computer. Like I don't download programs and run them. You know what I mean?

02:19:18.740 --> 02:19:25.100
Like it's kind of scary. So I heard it might have been an exploit in flash that got me but still

02:19:25.940 --> 02:19:27.580
terrible

02:19:27.580 --> 02:19:31.540
Terrible terrible. All right, just a couple more stories for you guys and then your calls Loki

02:19:32.260 --> 02:19:36.540
yes, so EA has trademarked a new game called the Ripper and

02:19:37.300 --> 02:19:41.740
what it's believed to be is actually a game based on Jack the Ripper and

02:19:42.900 --> 02:19:44.900
apparently I

02:19:44.900 --> 02:19:52.340
I guess this is a kinder gentler Jack the Ripper and not really he's killing people friendship friendship

02:19:52.620 --> 02:19:59.180
He's still killing people. But these people aren't really people. They're demons. So he's killing demons and

02:19:59.820 --> 02:20:05.300
Want to say I saw a law and order or no, not law and order. This is very similar to uh, god damn it

02:20:05.300 --> 02:20:07.300
there is a a

02:20:07.500 --> 02:20:09.500
Movie that was out there. I

02:20:09.500 --> 02:20:10.940
I

02:20:10.940 --> 02:20:16.420
Can't remember it now. Anyways, this is similar to movie, you know where you're killing demons with its people and stuff like that

02:20:16.900 --> 02:20:21.820
So yeah, think of like I guess a dead space game where you're Jack the Ripper ripping people apart

02:20:21.820 --> 02:20:24.300
But they're really demons so you shouldn't feel so bad about it

02:20:26.220 --> 02:20:28.220
Praise Jack the Ripper

02:20:28.780 --> 02:20:32.220
Interesting, I guess and it's believed that this is

02:20:33.660 --> 02:20:36.280
Visceral's games new action title

02:20:36.280 --> 02:20:38.280
All

02:20:39.240 --> 02:20:41.000
Right, I

02:20:41.000 --> 02:20:44.880
Guess I'll have to wait to see this game in motion there. It could be interesting

02:20:44.880 --> 02:20:47.200
I mean, I like the survival horror type games

02:20:47.200 --> 02:20:50.600
Although I have yet to check out saw but I'm kind of on the fence like, you know

02:20:50.600 --> 02:20:51.920
I'm not gonna get into it again

02:20:51.920 --> 02:20:54.280
But you know how I feel about the saw movies and that is I hate them

02:20:54.440 --> 02:20:58.680
But I am kind of curious about the game because the game's demo looked interesting at e3

02:20:58.680 --> 02:21:01.360
I'm surprised you haven't played it Loki seem like type of thing. You would have got all the time

02:21:01.360 --> 02:21:06.040
I'm playing DJ hero. Gotcha. All right. Anyhow, one more story for you guys

02:21:06.040 --> 02:21:08.660
Then we're gonna open up the skype line at one eight seven seven game

02:21:08.800 --> 02:21:12.780
Olr or our username on skype orange lounge radio hoping to hear from some new people tonight

02:21:13.280 --> 02:21:15.980
Because now we have some new people listening. So one eight seven seven game

02:21:15.980 --> 02:21:21.600
Olr username on skype is orange launch radio. We have one more story for you guys involving one of my favorite games

02:21:21.600 --> 02:21:26.080
In fact, probably my favorite game ever on the Commodore 64 at least I can think of right now

02:21:26.080 --> 02:21:32.000
Our con remember our con it was like battle chess but cooler because it wasn't actually chess

02:21:32.000 --> 02:21:35.720
But it was dark versus light and you were trying to take over these power squares

02:21:35.760 --> 02:21:40.680
but when you would when two pieces would come together like the shape-shifter and the Phoenix or the

02:21:41.080 --> 02:21:46.280
Banshee and the Valkyrie they would do battle in this arena and you would have basically have to kill one other piece

02:21:46.360 --> 02:21:51.240
So it wasn't like chess where whoever was the attacker was always the victor two pieces would fight

02:21:51.240 --> 02:21:54.200
Well, the game came on the iPhone not that long ago

02:21:54.200 --> 02:21:57.640
There was a version of it released for iPhone, which I forgot about that might be a game

02:21:57.640 --> 02:22:00.780
I need to pick up even though I just talked about how I don't play games on iPhone, but I love our con

02:22:01.380 --> 02:22:08.300
Well, apparently the game was so successful. Guess what our con is coming back to the PC. That's right

02:22:08.820 --> 02:22:15.500
Information coming from Chad Lee the owner and developer of react games in bringing our con back to the PC

02:22:15.500 --> 02:22:18.960
We've really focused on maintaining the classic feel of the original game

02:22:19.040 --> 02:22:22.600
That said there were aspects of the title that needed updating for the modern audience

02:22:22.600 --> 02:22:27.280
For example, the addition of four players was never in the original but it adds so much fun

02:22:27.280 --> 02:22:32.960
It feels like it always belonged there. So yes, there are achievements and HD resolution online support

02:22:33.000 --> 02:22:38.200
It's all gonna be there and apparently there's gonna be a new our con based iPhone game as well

02:22:38.640 --> 02:22:45.760
It's gonna be a single-player experience with four campaigns at 60 quests unique enemies and characters

02:22:46.160 --> 02:22:48.560
It's all gonna use ng moko's plus

02:22:48.560 --> 02:22:52.600
technology awards and a leaderboard and all that fun stuff

02:22:53.200 --> 02:22:59.920
our con conquest submitted to the App Store earlier this month should be out any time now and the first our con game just you

02:22:59.920 --> 02:23:03.400
Know was a remake of the first game. So that's very exciting

02:23:03.960 --> 02:23:09.020
Because I love our con. I'm a little iffy on this whole like four player modernized thing, but you know what?

02:23:09.020 --> 02:23:12.760
I'll still try it out. So hopefully it's cool kind of a bummer

02:23:12.760 --> 02:23:16.360
There's no console release, but at least hey anybody can put anything out on PC, right?

02:23:16.360 --> 02:23:17.600
anybody

02:23:17.600 --> 02:23:22.200
Anybody else a fan of our con just me just me. Okay. All right. I like battle chess

02:23:22.720 --> 02:23:29.720
Yeah, I never played the game. Did you ever play battle chess to know there was battle chess to Chinese chess

02:23:29.720 --> 02:23:34.600
And it was a totally I mean because obviously it was based off a Chinese chess totally different

02:23:34.640 --> 02:23:39.640
But I actually did play that when I was a kid tried to learn how to play Chinese chess. It's hard. It's not

02:23:40.200 --> 02:23:43.680
Chinese checkers Chinese chess totally different. Anyhow

02:23:43.680 --> 02:23:48.040
One eight seven seven game. Ol our username on skype is orange lounge radio

02:23:48.040 --> 02:23:50.120

So give us a call and comment on anything you've heard about tonight or any topic

02:23:54.640 --> 02:23:58.240
We haven't discussed that you'd like us to get into before we get into that

02:23:58.840 --> 02:24:02.060
And before the calls start rolling in since there is a little delay before the calls

02:24:02.160 --> 02:24:05.520
Hit our line when you guys hear it Loki any last-minute stories

02:24:07.800 --> 02:24:10.520
Yeah, the odd world games are coming to the PlayStation Network and

02:24:10.520 --> 02:24:13.800
Apparently tells that were exclusive before

02:24:14.600 --> 02:24:20.200
Also now coming to the PC. They have a new pack that they're basically release them under I guess the

02:24:20.960 --> 02:24:22.960
What was it the?

02:24:23.840 --> 02:24:25.840
Original no

02:24:26.200 --> 02:24:30.220
The odd box that's what it was including looks like a

02:24:32.040 --> 02:24:34.040
Stranger's wrath

02:24:34.360 --> 02:24:36.360
Munches Odyssey and

02:24:36.360 --> 02:24:43.200
The original odd world game so that's kind of cool. Um, that's it. Let me get to the phones. We have a call

02:24:43.200 --> 02:24:45.200
Hi, you're on orange launch radio

02:24:46.180 --> 02:24:51.880
Hello, you're oh my gosh Skype crashed on me that sucks that was not the caller's fault that was Skype's fault

02:24:51.880 --> 02:24:58.560
It just crashed that's like a bad Skype naughty naughty and I apologize to the caller that was on the line waiting to talk to us

02:24:58.880 --> 02:25:05.120
But computer crashes, I guess are inevitable. Thank God Adobe Edition didn't crash or we lose all part B of our show

02:25:05.120 --> 02:25:07.120
Wouldn't that be lovely do over?

02:25:08.160 --> 02:25:10.720
I'm gonna call that person back because they did get through

02:25:11.960 --> 02:25:13.200
mm-hmm

02:25:13.200 --> 02:25:16.160
This is a nice thing when you call through Skype. I know who it is. Hi

02:25:17.560 --> 02:25:21.200
You're on orange on this radio. Who's this? Hey, this is excellent. Hi X link

02:25:21.200 --> 02:25:24.880
I don't know if you heard if the buffer made it through for some reason Skype crashed. So we called you back

02:25:26.240 --> 02:25:29.560
Appreciate no, I was on there and I saw that I was like wow, that's kind of interesting

02:25:29.560 --> 02:25:32.960
I thought was my end because I'm having problems with my laptop right now with my

02:25:32.960 --> 02:25:37.900
Um mouse pad part with the click instead of clicking once you like to like like five different times

02:25:38.520 --> 02:25:42.360
Just sucks. Although I am thinking about using it on my PSP. I have a PSP headset

02:25:42.360 --> 02:25:44.360
I can use Skype on it, but I'm like who would call me

02:25:44.800 --> 02:25:46.040
like

02:25:46.040 --> 02:25:50.960
Nobody calls my iPhone. Why would people call me on Skype? I don't know. Anyway, sorry, that would be kind of interesting

02:25:51.800 --> 02:25:54.640
Few things I'm gonna make this make this quick course

02:25:54.640 --> 02:26:00.200
I'm gonna go through a few things here really quickly the PSP mini prices are actually pretty

02:26:00.200 --> 02:26:05.320
Decent the only one that's really the highest point as of right now would be the Tetris game

02:26:07.040 --> 02:26:08.500
Sudoku is

02:26:08.500 --> 02:26:14.560
$6.99 and there's a two other ones for $4.99 and I believe two or three other ones for $6.99

02:26:14.560 --> 02:26:16.560
So, I mean they're all under ten bucks

02:26:17.400 --> 02:26:23.880
Level in Sudoku though is zero. I mean I'm done with Sudoku you Sudoku can be played with paper in pen, but yeah

02:26:23.880 --> 02:26:25.880
I totally agree. I guess

02:26:25.880 --> 02:26:31.160
It's just EA though and you know EA is gonna be a little more expensive because you know the EA brand name being on it

02:26:31.160 --> 02:26:33.160
So, oh well hell of course

02:26:34.840 --> 02:26:38.360
As for the Kingdom Hearts I played a new one I've been playing a new one for DS

02:26:38.360 --> 02:26:43.120
I'm not gonna give anything away storyline wise but I'm gonna say I know you're a big fan of it

02:26:43.120 --> 02:26:46.060
Play it when you get a chance or you know buy it. It's

02:26:46.760 --> 02:26:53.360
Worth wild. It's been a lot of fun. I've been playing about ten hours and I've been pretty much addicted to it. So

02:26:53.360 --> 02:26:56.120
And there is a lot of different characters in it

02:26:56.120 --> 02:26:59.120
Okay, as long as they didn't cut out the Disney then I'm happy. How about Tron?

02:26:59.120 --> 02:27:03.840
You can spoil that for me is Tron in it. I believe I don't know be it quite honest

02:27:03.840 --> 02:27:07.920
I only played ten hours. I'm not really in I'm only on the second third world

02:27:07.920 --> 02:27:13.200
I was gonna say it was ten hours enough to get past the prologue like Kingdom Hearts 2. Oh, definitely

02:27:13.200 --> 02:27:17.240
You know, there's a lot of talk in the beginning and there's a lot of the beginning where they're saying

02:27:17.240 --> 02:27:21.160
Okay, this button is this this does this if you press this button it does this

02:27:21.160 --> 02:27:27.540
This is how you do stuff in the game. But once you get past all of it, it pretty much becomes normal. Hmm

02:27:27.800 --> 02:27:30.000
All right. Well, I'll have to check that out

02:27:30.000 --> 02:27:36.280
I suppose house look is it does it play like the PlayStation Kingdom Heart games or is it that it plays like that PS?

02:27:36.280 --> 02:27:41.880
Yes, the ps1 the Kingdom Hearts and Kingdom Hearts 2 it doesn't play like that good. It's not like the chain of memory

02:27:41.880 --> 02:27:43.880
Thank God good

02:27:44.120 --> 02:27:46.120
So I'm waiting for birth by sleep

02:27:46.120 --> 02:27:52.260
For the PSP now, so hopefully that will work well as well too. So well the way it's the on that one

02:27:52.840 --> 02:27:57.480
Very cool. I'll tell you if you want a headache try playing a chain of memories on a micro

02:27:58.680 --> 02:28:06.040
Thank you. No, thank you pass on that one. I did I do have the original though for the Gameboy advance

02:28:06.760 --> 02:28:12.640
But yeah, no, I I tried playing that was the last one I tried to play on any handheld. I

02:28:12.640 --> 02:28:18.120
I can only imagine what a headache machine that was anything else in your mind tonight excellent

02:28:18.120 --> 02:28:19.200
Well, it was kind of funny

02:28:19.200 --> 02:28:23.760
You robbed the whole hacking issue wasn't they having a problem with the Xbox Live and the hacking on that one, too?

02:28:23.760 --> 02:28:28.840
People are trying to get some people were trying it to people's accounts to that one that had high game scores

02:28:28.840 --> 02:28:32.320
Yeah, it was it was retarded stuff. It was like some kid

02:28:33.080 --> 02:28:38.200
Sending voice messages to people saying I can give you cheats or whatever if you send me your account information

02:28:38.200 --> 02:28:42.760
So like, you know, it you'd have to be an idiot to fall for that. Yeah, I

02:28:44.080 --> 02:28:50.120
Live at least that I know of yet. I mean, I've been out of Xbox Live for about two months now, so

02:28:51.880 --> 02:28:55.480
I've been on longer than that. So I've been busy doing my school stuff

02:28:55.480 --> 02:29:00.560
So I can yeah, you can understand that but they're trying to probably sound like someone they were pulling back in the you know

02:29:00.560 --> 02:29:06.400
Hey days of hey, give me I'm so I'm surprised or not. I'm so-and-so from Xbox Live. I need your name and password

02:29:06.400 --> 02:29:08.680
There's been a system server crash that type of deal

02:29:09.240 --> 02:29:13.640
Well, I hope everyone knows by now. Nobody will ask you for your name and password online a

02:29:14.280 --> 02:29:21.200
Nobody that just doesn't happen not through email not online. It doesn't happen. Even when you call support they don't ask for it

02:29:21.200 --> 02:29:23.620
They have ways of verifying you in other ways. So

02:29:24.320 --> 02:29:29.520
Like I know with Blizzard, I guess I filled out a security question about like for example

02:29:29.920 --> 02:29:31.620
This wasn't my security question

02:29:31.620 --> 02:29:34.320
But like an example would be what was your house number as a child?

02:29:34.320 --> 02:29:37.020
You know things that only you would know that a hacker wouldn't know

02:29:37.480 --> 02:29:43.220
Yeah, so well anything else in your mind tonight? Excellent. Yeah, that's pretty much about it. All right, even so

02:29:43.220 --> 02:29:47.000
I heard that's one the hardest ones yet from Atlas and I'm hearing they're getting good reviews from it

02:29:47.000 --> 02:29:48.120
So you have a lot of fun with that

02:29:48.120 --> 02:29:49.200
I just you know

02:29:49.200 --> 02:29:53.680
Although I can see from a critical standpoint where it's getting good reviews and I'm not knocking the game at all

02:29:53.680 --> 02:30:00.000
But the difficulty is really gonna turn some people off. So proceed carefully. Oh, I agree, but hey Atlas

02:30:00.600 --> 02:30:02.200
RPGs you can't really beat that

02:30:02.200 --> 02:30:07.080
I mean the every pretty much everything they have sealed with their name on there has been pretty much gold

02:30:07.080 --> 02:30:11.940
So, all right fair enough. They do make good stuff. All right, take care. Excellent. Yeah YouTube. Thanks for the call

02:30:12.720 --> 02:30:15.760
We got comments in chat here. What is this?

02:30:17.040 --> 02:30:23.320
Kill Gannon one three three seven says I wonder if Rob's Wow pass was secure like caps numbers and shit

02:30:23.320 --> 02:30:27.040
Um, I didn't use caps, but my password

02:30:27.040 --> 02:30:33.320
To somebody who wouldn't know better would look like an a random jumble of letters

02:30:33.320 --> 02:30:37.860
They meant something to me, but for most people just look like a random jumble of letters and numbers

02:30:37.860 --> 02:30:41.220
I did use both letters and numbers so I don't think by any means it was easy to guess

02:30:41.520 --> 02:30:44.400
Like it wasn't like a pet name. It wasn't

02:30:45.400 --> 02:30:50.580
You know anything like that. So let's go to another call. Hi. You're on orange launch radio. Who's this?

02:30:50.580 --> 02:30:55.540
Hello, you're on orange launch radio, who's this?

02:30:58.020 --> 02:31:00.520
Hola bienvenidos all orange lounge radio kenis

02:31:02.040 --> 02:31:07.980
Okay, yes, the person isn't there remember you can always call echo one two three before you give us a call to make sure

02:31:07.980 --> 02:31:11.740
Your setup works. That's always a good idea. So there you go

02:31:11.740 --> 02:31:21.820
A one eight seven seven game olr or username on skype orange lounge radio

02:31:21.820 --> 02:31:26.780
If you want to give us a call was that it for last minute story tonight Loki G rent is pretty much it I think

02:31:29.340 --> 02:31:31.780
Hold on we had another call. Hi, you're on orange launch radio. Who's this?

02:31:31.780 --> 02:31:40.540
Hi, how are you? Oh pretty good. How are you? No good. It wouldn't be a skype segment without you. What's on your mind?

02:31:42.140 --> 02:31:46.620
Two quick tips, I don't want to take up too much time because you're near the end of your show

02:31:47.620 --> 02:31:51.500
I guess, you know one tip of information regarding

02:31:52.180 --> 02:31:54.180
PS the PSN store

02:31:54.180 --> 02:32:01.900
We released from I think was last week. Yeah, and now also at the same time. I also want to put some moment about

02:32:02.700 --> 02:32:04.700
PlayStation 3 as well

02:32:05.260 --> 02:32:07.260
There was one release

02:32:07.860 --> 02:32:14.380
On the PSN store. It's a PS1 classic. Yeah, I think you guys me and like it was

02:32:15.100 --> 02:32:21.780
Pandemonium which was poured out by I think crystal dynamics. Yes. I I've never played the game, but I

02:32:21.780 --> 02:32:26.060
I've heard I actually have the Japanese version of it, which was

02:32:27.740 --> 02:32:29.740
Magical hoppers. Oh

02:32:30.540 --> 02:32:33.260
Yeah, I used to hit the desk version

02:32:33.860 --> 02:32:38.820
Fortunately, I had that stolen a couple years ago. So I just bought the download version

02:32:39.700 --> 02:32:46.100
And it's pretty good. The graphics are kind of dated by today's standards, but all in all it's pretty good

02:32:46.100 --> 02:32:52.380
You know, I mean as far as my complaint isn't so much with the system itself

02:32:52.380 --> 02:32:57.940
It's just fun, but it doesn't yeah too pretty of some of the other users on it

02:32:58.660 --> 02:33:05.780
You know how well with the messaging on there, you know, they get the whole cut-and-paste kind of deal on there

02:33:06.420 --> 02:33:09.940
Well, I yeah, well, I don't know if you've seen this yet or not

02:33:09.940 --> 02:33:12.460
You know, if not, you probably will see it soon

02:33:12.460 --> 02:33:18.720
But you know people have been doing it on piece checking messages. No, no

02:33:20.020 --> 02:33:22.980
Oh, yeah, it's like, you know

02:33:23.260 --> 02:33:30.140
if if you you're send this message to X number people so he's gonna see this and

02:33:30.940 --> 02:33:37.260
And they're gonna track this message and you know, they'll really key low on the PlayStation 3

02:33:37.260 --> 02:33:42.580
My god that ridiculous I'm like, you know, really that's why I'm thinking a

02:33:43.380 --> 02:33:45.820
You know, he low and gears and all they are

02:33:46.500 --> 02:33:51.540
Microsoft exclusive now, they're gonna notice nopes calm just for PlayStation Network

02:33:51.540 --> 02:33:56.140
It sounds like they're just gonna need something to try to diffuse all the rumors there, you know

02:33:56.140 --> 02:33:58.740
I'm surprised and I hope I'm not starting something here

02:33:58.740 --> 02:34:03.060
I'm surprised I don't get that crap on my iPhone ever since they did the copy paste thing on iPhone, too

02:34:03.060 --> 02:34:09.980
But I suppose whenever you open this up to you know, having the copy paste you wouldn't even really need it

02:34:09.980 --> 02:34:13.420
I suppose it just makes it a lot easier to send these chain messages and crap

02:34:13.420 --> 02:34:20.420
But just you know think before you forward good rule of thumb for everybody out there think before you forward

02:34:20.500 --> 02:34:24.900
Do you really think Sony cares about what you're writing in messages to other people?

02:34:25.060 --> 02:34:31.060
No, they don't they only put this stuff in the front end for you know as another feature

02:34:31.060 --> 02:34:36.180
But they don't read your messages you're sending to other people and they don't track messages. That's a bunch of crap

02:34:37.380 --> 02:34:43.420
Yes. Yeah, that's why I've been saying to all the people that have been sending me to these, you know

02:34:43.420 --> 02:34:47.460
Yeah, I just tell them that by sending these messages

02:34:47.460 --> 02:34:52.820
You're annoying crap out of other people and you're just showing how ignorant you are

02:34:52.820 --> 02:34:58.020
I mean, you know using their prior example, I gave you know

02:34:58.020 --> 02:35:01.300
You know, Microsoft's exclusives aren't going to read me

02:35:01.300 --> 02:35:05.540
Microsoft's exclusives, you know, the pizza will fly out to someone's

02:35:05.540 --> 02:35:12.900
Nellie reasons before those exclusives will show up on you know, PSG and vice versa

02:35:12.900 --> 02:35:18.420
Exactly, that kind of stuff is just ridiculous that the exclusives would make their way to Sony

02:35:18.420 --> 02:35:20.420
I mean people ought to know better

02:35:20.420 --> 02:35:23.060
Did you have any other topics for us tonight Spaznier?

02:35:23.060 --> 02:35:28.180
No, no, no, pretty much covers it

02:35:28.180 --> 02:35:29.860
I'll probably let you go

02:35:29.860 --> 02:35:34.020
I would imagine you probably want to squeeze in one more call and maybe close off afterwards

02:35:34.020 --> 02:35:38.900
All right. Well, thank you as always Spaznier and keep on rocking the PlayStation

02:35:38.900 --> 02:35:39.780
All right, have a good one

02:35:39.780 --> 02:35:40.580
Take care

02:35:40.580 --> 02:35:43.220
You know, actually I did buy a PS original not that long ago

02:35:43.220 --> 02:35:48.100
I bought Unjamma Lamy on the PlayStation Network because you know, it's funny

02:35:48.100 --> 02:35:49.860
I actually already own the disc for that

02:35:49.860 --> 02:35:54.420
But I bought Unjamma Lamy just so I could have it on my PSP

02:35:55.700 --> 02:35:56.900
So, hi, you're on Orange

02:35:56.900 --> 02:35:58.180
I bought Parappa

02:35:58.180 --> 02:35:58.820
Hi, you're on Orange

02:35:58.820 --> 02:35:59.460
All right

02:35:59.460 --> 02:36:00.100
Who's this?

02:36:00.100 --> 02:36:01.140
Legend of Zaku

02:36:01.140 --> 02:36:02.420
Hopefully now

02:36:02.420 --> 02:36:04.020
Yes, we can hear you loud and clear

02:36:04.020 --> 02:36:05.380
What's up Legend of Zaku?

02:36:06.260 --> 02:36:10.900
Nothing much, just trying to kill just trying to kill another dull weekend and

02:36:11.540 --> 02:36:13.300
aside from the Yanks winning

02:36:13.300 --> 02:36:20.900
But yeah, I mean from basically what I've been seeing so far of PSP

02:36:20.900 --> 02:36:22.900
Go has been getting a lot of flack

02:36:22.900 --> 02:36:24.340
Most of it's actually deserving

02:36:24.980 --> 02:36:27.460
Just for the fact that Sony is just done

02:36:28.260 --> 02:36:34.340
They just haven't made it easy for existing PSP owners to give them the incentive to switch on

02:36:35.140 --> 02:36:37.540
Especially when transferring existing UMDs

02:36:38.100 --> 02:36:42.020
Did you see that story earlier this week where Reggie Fils-Aime has even come out and said

02:36:42.020 --> 02:36:43.940
I don't get the PSP Go basically

02:36:45.300 --> 02:36:49.060
Actually, I think he's right for the fact that for the most part

02:36:49.060 --> 02:36:53.460
Every upgrade to the DS allowed people to play their old existing games

02:36:54.100 --> 02:37:00.020
So in that sense, Sony's basically going two steps forward, one step back

02:37:01.540 --> 02:37:02.980
Actually, no wait, what am I saying?

02:37:02.980 --> 02:37:04.900
Two steps backward, one step forward

02:37:04.900 --> 02:37:06.260
I like this, it's all right

02:37:06.260 --> 02:37:09.860
I like this what Toa Gak says in our chat and I probably horribly mispronounced that name

02:37:09.860 --> 02:37:10.660
I apologize

02:37:10.660 --> 02:37:14.020
But Toa Gak says PSP Go equals PSP No

02:37:14.900 --> 02:37:17.140
Exactly, I mean I have my original PS

02:37:17.140 --> 02:37:20.260
I mean I have my slim PSP and I love it

02:37:20.260 --> 02:37:23.940
You know, I love that thing to death just because I can play UMDs on it

02:37:23.940 --> 02:37:28.260
So any new game that's still coming out, at least I have a hard copy of it

02:37:28.260 --> 02:37:30.900
That's like something you'd see on a protest sign at a march or something

02:37:32.740 --> 02:37:36.900
But I guess Sony really dropped the ball for this time around

02:37:36.900 --> 02:37:39.620
They can put all the memory they want on a single unit

02:37:39.620 --> 02:37:45.140
It's not going to change the fact that if you have your UMDs

02:37:45.140 --> 02:37:46.900
They're practically obsolete at this point

02:37:48.900 --> 02:37:50.020
You know, for new hardware

02:37:50.820 --> 02:37:56.820
So it doesn't give people that incentive to just impulsively buy that new system

02:37:58.260 --> 02:37:59.940
I want to read this comment in chat here real quick

02:37:59.940 --> 02:38:04.100
Kutsune in chat says the PSP Go is only for those who don't already have a PSP

02:38:04.100 --> 02:38:08.260
And I understand that point and I almost would agree with it

02:38:08.260 --> 02:38:13.860
Almost, except I feel like with the PSP Go you get less choice than you have with the PSP 3000

02:38:13.860 --> 02:38:15.540
Right, I mean you can't even sell

02:38:16.180 --> 02:38:20.020
Everything's digital, there's no second-hand sales of games

02:38:20.020 --> 02:38:25.300
Like you would with the UMD taking it to GameStop for money

02:38:25.300 --> 02:38:31.380
If there was a faster processor, a second analog, something else in here

02:38:31.380 --> 02:38:36.420
PS2 capability of games, something else in here I could recommend

02:38:36.420 --> 02:38:37.620
I would be all about that

02:38:37.620 --> 02:38:44.580
Right, if it was a brand new PSP, a new version of it

02:38:44.580 --> 02:38:49.540
A completely new version outside of the fact that there's already been three so far

02:38:51.060 --> 02:38:53.380
I mean that would be more than enough

02:38:53.380 --> 02:38:59.460
But if it's more of the same with just like superficial tacked on features like Bluetooth

02:38:59.460 --> 02:39:03.220
Which should have been in recent PSP iterations already

02:39:03.220 --> 02:39:07.700
It just feels like Sony's like, you know, they're fucking up

02:39:07.700 --> 02:39:10.820
You know, you're preaching to the choir here and it's tough

02:39:10.820 --> 02:39:15.220
Because we want to give Sony credit for the things they're doing right on the PlayStation 3

02:39:15.220 --> 02:39:17.300
But then you can't turn the blind eye on the Go

02:39:17.300 --> 02:39:22.980
But the PSP, they're just acting like a bunch of chickens with their heads cut off

02:39:22.980 --> 02:39:27.220
Because they don't even know how to make a product that not only new people would want

02:39:27.220 --> 02:39:29.060
But the existing base

02:39:30.100 --> 02:39:32.900
If you can't woo them, then that thing is dead in the water

02:39:32.900 --> 02:39:34.340
Yeah, I agree

02:39:34.340 --> 02:39:35.780
Well, what else is on your mind tonight, Zaku?

02:39:37.300 --> 02:39:38.020
Nothing much

02:39:38.020 --> 02:39:44.980
I mean except for the fact that, well, a few weeks ago I did attend an old-timers DDR tournament

02:39:44.980 --> 02:39:47.700
Out on the break even though I didn't compete

02:39:47.700 --> 02:39:52.580
It was basically a 32-man fifth mix tournament that took hours to complete

02:39:53.620 --> 02:39:57.300
So that was the other highlight of these past few weeks

02:39:58.740 --> 02:40:00.340
Eight on the break's a good arcade

02:40:00.340 --> 02:40:04.100
I've been there, of course, and I haven't been there in a few years

02:40:04.100 --> 02:40:06.980
Well, they put fifth mix already

02:40:06.980 --> 02:40:08.260
They've been having that for months

02:40:08.260 --> 02:40:12.260
And during Kings of the Coast, their big tournament in August

02:40:12.260 --> 02:40:14.100
They were running a fourth mix plus tournament

02:40:14.100 --> 02:40:16.820
So yeah, they're really throwing it back right over there

02:40:16.820 --> 02:40:19.140
My love for eight on the break isn't just with the music games

02:40:19.140 --> 02:40:22.500
But the fact that I didn't feel like that place was overrun with redemption games

02:40:22.500 --> 02:40:23.460
It was a real arcade

02:40:23.460 --> 02:40:24.740
Not only that, it's like cheap food

02:40:24.740 --> 02:40:26.820
Four dollars will pretty much fill your stomach

02:40:28.420 --> 02:40:28.900
Good point

02:40:28.900 --> 02:40:31.300
Although it is, I wouldn't want to live on that food if you know what I mean

02:40:32.260 --> 02:40:32.500
All right

02:40:32.500 --> 02:40:32.980
I mean that

02:40:33.620 --> 02:40:36.100
Zach, we're going to let you go to try and maybe squeeze in one more call

02:40:36.100 --> 02:40:37.060
But thank you so much for the call

02:40:37.060 --> 02:40:38.020
Okay, buddy

02:40:38.020 --> 02:40:38.740
All right, have a good one

02:40:38.740 --> 02:40:39.380
Go Yankees!

02:40:40.100 --> 02:40:40.340
Yes

02:40:40.980 --> 02:40:43.460
I always say that because my coworker loves the, I don't follow baseball

02:40:43.460 --> 02:40:44.980
My coworker loves the Yankees

02:40:44.980 --> 02:40:48.580
So I know that if the Yankees win, it's going to be a good day at work tomorrow

02:40:48.580 --> 02:40:50.020
Because people will be happy

02:40:50.020 --> 02:40:52.980
So actually I think that's going to do it for the Skype line tonight

02:40:52.980 --> 02:40:54.500
So sorry to those that didn't get through

02:40:54.500 --> 02:40:57.940
But you can always send us an email to mailbag at orangelauntrader.com

02:40:57.940 --> 02:40:59.700
But for now, we want to go ahead and wrap up the show

02:40:59.700 --> 02:41:02.980
And before we do that, we got to get everybody's final thoughts

02:41:02.980 --> 02:41:05.300
Actually, I'm sorry, last minute stories if we have any left

02:41:05.300 --> 02:41:06.900
I don't know if, Loki, you had anything else left

02:41:08.180 --> 02:41:09.140
Well, let's see

02:41:10.100 --> 02:41:11.380
I guess I could talk about

02:41:12.100 --> 02:41:14.500
Well, they had a, you know, speaking of the PSP Go

02:41:14.500 --> 02:41:19.540
There was a knockoff PSP Go-ish type device that was coming out

02:41:20.260 --> 02:41:22.500
The PXP MP5

02:41:23.140 --> 02:41:25.700
And I had to laugh though because some of the specs on it

02:41:25.700 --> 02:41:29.140
Like it had a built-in camera, it could play emulation games and stuff like that

02:41:29.140 --> 02:41:31.700
I'm like, wow, that's already better than the PSP Go

02:41:32.660 --> 02:41:36.820
But yeah, I would imagine the camera is pretty low quality and all that stuff

02:41:36.820 --> 02:41:38.100
It is a lot cheaper though

02:41:38.100 --> 02:41:42.740
But it'll be interesting to see how much it actually sells

02:41:42.740 --> 02:41:44.260
And I don't even know if we'll be able to tell that

02:41:44.260 --> 02:41:47.300
Because it's going to be the PlayStation Portable Platform

02:41:47.300 --> 02:41:49.060
And not necessarily the PSP Go

02:41:49.060 --> 02:41:53.380
But yeah, I bet you it's going to just slump off to nothing by the time a holiday comes around

02:41:53.380 --> 02:41:56.580
Are you able to figure out the real sales figures for PSP Go?

02:41:56.580 --> 02:41:58.660
I don't know, they could do it with the DSI and the DS

02:41:58.660 --> 02:42:01.620
So I wouldn't see why they wouldn't be able to at the PSP Go

02:42:01.620 --> 02:42:06.260
But I know we're not selling a lot of them, that's for sure

02:42:06.260 --> 02:42:07.540
A lot of people are backing out on them

02:42:07.540 --> 02:42:11.300
We get a few people ordering like one in their store just to have it

02:42:11.300 --> 02:42:14.260
But I don't think it's really

02:42:14.260 --> 02:42:15.060
They never call back

02:42:15.620 --> 02:42:17.300
No, no, they get it

02:42:17.300 --> 02:42:20.740
And you know, they may reorder one here and there because people are looking for them

02:42:20.740 --> 02:42:22.420
But they're not like pushing them, I guess

02:42:22.420 --> 02:42:25.060
I see, all right

02:42:25.060 --> 02:42:27.220
Well, that's it for last minute stories then

02:42:27.220 --> 02:42:29.220
Let's go around and get everybody's final thought

02:42:29.220 --> 02:42:33.700
Dark Sakura, thank you as always for your lovely contributions to the show

02:42:33.700 --> 02:42:36.100
The Female Perspective, you're on Orange Lounge Radio

02:42:36.740 --> 02:42:37.700
When I can't provide it

02:42:38.260 --> 02:42:39.540
Dark Sakura, your final thought?

02:42:40.740 --> 02:42:44.020
I want frozen yogurt, but I'm not going to have any

02:42:44.900 --> 02:42:47.300
Sorry to hear that because frozen yogurt is amazing

02:42:47.300 --> 02:42:47.780
Fro-Yo

02:42:48.340 --> 02:42:48.980
We should go

02:42:49.780 --> 02:42:52.100
We should, but I don't think the show will be over in time

02:42:52.100 --> 02:42:53.540
This isn't that place close at 10?

02:42:53.540 --> 02:42:53.780
Yeah

02:42:53.780 --> 02:42:54.660
Yeah, we have Afterbirth

02:42:54.660 --> 02:42:56.420
So I think we have three new songs tonight, right?

02:42:57.140 --> 02:42:57.380
Yeah

02:42:57.380 --> 02:42:57.780
We do

02:42:58.740 --> 02:42:59.780
Did you win last?

02:42:59.780 --> 02:43:00.340
I don't remember

02:43:00.340 --> 02:43:02.580
You won't win anything because my song was all fucked up

02:43:02.580 --> 02:43:03.700
I won't talk about during Afterbirth

02:43:04.260 --> 02:43:06.660
Loki, your final thought tonight?

02:43:06.660 --> 02:43:12.420
I need to move the cabinet into the house and then the next project is to rebuild the DVR pads

02:43:12.420 --> 02:43:14.420
Already have them designed and everything

02:43:14.420 --> 02:43:15.380
They're gonna be awesome

02:43:17.060 --> 02:43:20.100
My final thought for the day is happy national coming out day

02:43:20.100 --> 02:43:22.420
And equality for all means just that

02:43:22.420 --> 02:43:24.260
Equal rights for all

02:43:24.260 --> 02:43:25.860
Equal, equal, equal

02:43:25.860 --> 02:43:31.060
There is no such thing as a domestic partnership being equal rights in any way shape or form

02:43:31.060 --> 02:43:33.940
I had one of my friends actually, it was funny that you mentioned that

02:43:33.940 --> 02:43:36.900
Last weekend he came up and stuff, he came out to me

02:43:36.900 --> 02:43:38.660
He's been apparently married

02:43:39.300 --> 02:43:40.820
He got married during that time too

02:43:41.620 --> 02:43:42.900
That it was legal

02:43:42.900 --> 02:43:43.380
And so

02:43:44.020 --> 02:43:46.100
Oh, it's part of the 18,000

02:43:46.100 --> 02:43:46.340
Yeah

02:43:46.340 --> 02:43:49.380
Oh, I thought you meant this was like a married man to a woman who came out too

02:43:49.380 --> 02:43:50.500
Because that could be very difficult

02:43:50.500 --> 02:43:52.180
I've met men who have gone through

02:43:52.180 --> 02:43:52.820
No, no, no, no

02:43:52.820 --> 02:43:53.140
Okay

02:43:53.140 --> 02:43:54.820
No, no idea whatsoever

02:43:54.820 --> 02:43:57.300
But he's had a boyfriend for like, you know, ever since

02:43:57.300 --> 02:44:01.780
Even like during like when he came to our wedding stuff

02:44:01.780 --> 02:44:02.660
You've actually met him

02:44:03.540 --> 02:44:06.340
But, you know, I was like, why didn't you bring him?

02:44:06.340 --> 02:44:08.020
I'm like, that would have been okay

02:44:08.020 --> 02:44:10.260
But he's just, he's not coming out there but yet

02:44:10.260 --> 02:44:12.820
I met a lot of people at your wedding so I probably wouldn't remember him

02:44:12.820 --> 02:44:14.580
But props

02:44:14.580 --> 02:44:14.820
I

02:44:14.820 --> 02:44:18.980
Because California is the only state where like some marriages are legal

02:44:18.980 --> 02:44:20.980
And they don't know how to explain how it works

02:44:20.980 --> 02:44:22.420
Let me give you a hint California

02:44:22.420 --> 02:44:23.540
Here's how to get it right

02:44:23.540 --> 02:44:26.100
Equal, equal, equal

02:44:26.100 --> 02:44:26.820
Across the board

02:44:26.820 --> 02:44:28.020
That's how you do it

02:44:28.020 --> 02:44:29.940
There's no reason for it

02:44:30.820 --> 02:44:34.340
No religious text should ever take away equality

02:44:34.340 --> 02:44:34.660
Ever

02:44:35.380 --> 02:44:35.940
So

02:44:35.940 --> 02:44:36.420
Anyhow

02:44:36.980 --> 02:44:37.300
That's it

02:44:37.300 --> 02:44:38.420
I'll get off my soapbox now

02:44:38.980 --> 02:44:39.620
That's gonna do it

02:44:39.620 --> 02:44:40.980
For another episode of Orange on its Radio

02:44:40.980 --> 02:44:42.260
Thank you guys so much for tuning into us

02:44:42.260 --> 02:44:43.620
We had a really good listener count tonight

02:44:43.620 --> 02:44:45.700
Especially considering we've been off for a week

02:44:45.700 --> 02:44:46.900
So that must mean you missed us

02:44:46.900 --> 02:44:47.780
So thank you very much

02:44:47.780 --> 02:44:50.820
And you don't hate us too much for falling behind on the podcast feed and all that stuff

02:44:50.820 --> 02:44:52.340
Hey I bet their aim's improving

02:44:52.340 --> 02:44:53.140
I bet so too

02:44:53.140 --> 02:44:55.300
But we'll be back next week to do it all again

02:44:55.300 --> 02:44:57.220
I don't know if we have anything special planned for next week

02:44:57.220 --> 02:45:00.260
Unfortunately we're not doing the big gaming marathon next week

02:45:00.260 --> 02:45:03.700
But if you aren't already tuning into it somewhere

02:45:03.700 --> 02:45:06.420
Please be sure you're watching the Extra Life marathon somewhere

02:45:06.980 --> 02:45:09.860
That's all Sarcastic Gamer and other podcasts is doing that

02:45:09.860 --> 02:45:14.100
And you know we are all for the Extra Life marathon

02:45:14.100 --> 02:45:16.340
That is going to happen around the internet on Saturday

02:45:16.340 --> 02:45:18.020
So please look for that and donate

02:45:18.020 --> 02:45:19.940
I'm sure there'll be other ones later on

02:45:19.940 --> 02:45:23.220
Oh yeah we'll participate in something later on

02:45:23.220 --> 02:45:25.620
For sure a good cause somewhere

02:45:25.620 --> 02:45:26.660
But that's going to do it for now

02:45:26.660 --> 02:45:28.100
For us have a great week everybody

02:45:28.100 --> 02:45:30.500
We'll see you next week on Orange Lounge Radio

02:45:30.500 --> 02:45:34.740
If you've enjoyed the show all we ask you just tell a couple people about the show

02:45:34.740 --> 02:45:36.260
Help spread by word of mouth

02:45:36.260 --> 02:45:39.060
Because remember that's all we've got to promote Orange Lounge Radio

02:45:39.060 --> 02:45:44.180
We don't have any fancy magazines or big million hits a month website to back us up

02:45:44.180 --> 02:45:46.980
We only have you guys to help spread the word

02:45:46.980 --> 02:45:48.740
So that's it have a great week

02:45:48.740 --> 02:46:15.540
We'll see you next time here on Orange Lounge Radio

02:46:18.740 --> 02:46:20.660
But we're probably right anyway

02:46:20.660 --> 02:46:48.420
See you next week
