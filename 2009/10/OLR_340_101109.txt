Good night, October 11th, 2009.
Epic Mickey is confirmed this week as a real game.
Could you soon see the Wii balance board used in Airport Security and the Commodore 64?
Hello everybody out there on the internet, on their iPods, on allgames.com, or however you're listening to our show.
Welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
We are that show dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.
We like to think of ourselves as the show where every gamer has a voice.
With you here every week is myself, Rob Roberts, and joining me as always, say hello to the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.
Yo.
How are you doing, DarkSakura?
I'm doing great.
Good.
Good to hear.
Yeah.
And guess what?
What?
I don't have to work tomorrow.
Lucky you.
What is up with... Who celebrates Columbus Day anymore?
Banks, apparently.
Colombians.
Also joining us, say hello to Techmaster, Loki.
Hello.
How are you doing, Loki?
I'm doing good.
Awesome.
How was your couple weeks off?
Because you missed the mini-show we did.
We talked about that before.
I guess you just kind of spaced it on Tuesday.
I had crap going on on Tuesday, so I forgot all about it.
So we pre-recorded so that, you know, because it's been weird.
We've missed a couple weeks and that's all my fault, I apologize.
But we pre-recorded a show for last week and Loki, you just kind of didn't come.
Yeah, I spaced.
You were better than that show.
Sorry.
What did you get done last Sunday in absence of Orange Haunch Radio?
I put in sprinklers.
Yeah?
Yeah, that was not fun.
Thanks for watching!
I don't know.
When you're digging that stuff out, especially if you dig it out onto grass and stuff like that, you end up losing some of the dirt because you just can't scrape all of it out of the grass.
There's big divots where all the pipes are.
At the same time, we also chop through the cable line, which is fun.
We had to fix that too.
They went in.
They work.
I ran them today trying to flush out the water because now our water out of our fridge tastes like crap.
DarkSakura.com
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Robocop Window
Yeah, I saw them last week.
Bunnies?
In the neighbor's yard.
Wow.
Sorry.
I heard a rooster earlier and now bunnies.
Are we out on a farm today or something?
Well, our neighbors across the street, they let their bunnies run wild all over the neighborhood.
And they usually like to hang out in my yard.
So we have stray bunnies.
Gotcha.
And not stray dogs or cats.
We have stray bunnies.
Been watching Dan play more ODST?
That game makes me motion sick.
I don't really care for it.
Gotcha.
I'm like, ugh, turn off this loud piece of crap.
But Dan loves it, so if he's having fun with it, then he can have fun, just not when I'm trying to go to bed.
And just for folks who are newer to the show who may not know, you've never been a fan of first-person shooters because they just make you ill.
Well, I liked them before they used 3D.
When they were sprite-based, great.
Like Wolfenstein was fine, right?
Yeah, and Doom.
Doom.
All right.
Well, let's move on.
Loki, how was your gaming week?
My gaming week was pretty good, I guess.
I played more Grand Theft Auto Lost and Damned, where I'm up to almost rank five.
I would have been ranked five on Friday, but I dropped out of one of my games, so...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
and then was it my sister's 360 died so now and it's funny hers died the same way as my last one did where it basically lost its graphics processor you know got like a green tint to it and then the whole thing just no video anymore so that kind of sucked there's no real way to fix that and obviously it's not under warranty since hers is modded as well so that doesn't work but we have a way to remedy that soon enough and then um
I played some DJ Hero.
I have a demo unit that I got, and I've been playing the four songs that are on there.
Well, three technically in the set, and then there's a fourth one, which is like a DJ versus guitar song in there, which I didn't really play that much of because not a lot of people wanted to play guitar.
And then I've been having a lot of fun with that.
The controller is pretty nice, although since it is a demo unit, it's wired instead of wireless, which is fine.
I don't really give a crap, because I hate replacing batteries anyways.
and um the only thing that sucks about those you can't flip it because the way the chord comes out it actually um would be in the way if you flipped it to left-handed um i guess lefty side um although for me i don't really care because i'm right-handed but my co-worker wasn't he wanted to really try it and i'm like dude sorry you can't so he had to play cross-handed
DJ Hero
They may not like it because it's nothing like 2DX.
It's more like Guitar Hero.
It's just like the comparison of 2DX and Guitar Hero.
They're really not similar at all.
Other than you have notes coming down the screen, but that's about it.
The scratching in the game is almost like strumming on the guitar a little bit.
And then...
Thanks for watching!
Thanks for watching!
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
But you'll pick it up pretty quick.
I mean, just from watching the videos, I started off playing Medium, and I picked it up pretty quick.
I kind of want to try hard.
I haven't gotten a chance to do that yet.
Because also, the demo too kind of sucks because you can't calibrate it because it is a demo.
And so, on the TV we're playing, there's some lag.
And so, trying to fix that, you know, you kind of have to compensate for it.
But in the full version, you will be able to calibrate it.
Yeah, in the full version, it'll have all that stuff.
It's just, you know, because it's just a basic demo, they don't have that built in.
Now, this game's going to cost $130, right?
$120.
We are...
I think it's $120.
Well, after tax, $130.
$130, yeah.
Let's be real.
So this game is going to set you back about $130.
Who should drop?
I mean, that's a big investment.
I mean, for $70 more, you can buy a console.
For $20 more, you can buy a Wii.
That's as much as a Nintendo DS.
Who should drop $130 on this game?
Who should not drop $130 on this game?
DarkSakura?
I was going to say, don't drop the money on this game if you're on food stamps.
Well, duh, DarkSakura.
I mean, yeah, if it's not in your budget, then it's not in your budget.
But, I mean, if, you know, you're debating...
And the other thing you've got to understand is, unlike Guitar Hero and Rock Band, this controller is only going to work with this game.
So far.
So far.
I mean, it's not going to work.
Harmonix is not going to come out with a DJ game that's going to be exactly like this.
And so you're not going to have uniformity that way.
So...
You've got to be really willing to stick to this series.
And you know what?
After playing the three songs in there, I'm fine with dropping the money.
And I'll be honest, I know a lot of people frown upon buying demos, but yes, I bought this demo unit.
And yes, it's the same one that you saw on Destructoid.
I bought that unit.
I paid the money to buy it.
And yeah, I know it's retarded, but...
I had nefarious intentions, trust me, originally.
But having played it, I probably am going to buy the full game only because I can get it early.
And that's really why I'm excited to play this game.
But if I wanted to, I could pirate it.
But I'm not going to because I want to play it early.
I wasn't going to say anything about how you got this game because most people would assume you get it through your work channels.
No, my work doesn't hook me up for crap.
What possessed you to...
Drop that money on it.
Because I wanted to play it.
Because I'm impatient.
And because I figured, hey, you know what?
I can drop the money on this demo unit and the controller works just fine.
And you know what?
I have the means to play modded games on my console, so if I really want to not spend the money, I can do that.
Only you can tell you how to spend your money, and the wife now, because that's part of the whole marriage thing, but hopefully she liked it too.
She hasn't really seen it, she's just like, I don't know, she laughed because Hollaback Girl was in the demo, but...
I don't care, you know, because if I don't want to buy the game, I can still play the game, technically, but I'm not condoning piracy or anything, and not a lot of people will be pirating this game anyway, since, you know, you need a controller for it, so...
All right.
Let me go to our chat room.
We always have the chat comments here.
Chat.OrangeLoungeRadio.com But for the record, though, I am buying the game on top of this.
So I have two controllers for party situations and stuff like that.
And actually, I want to lead into our first chat comment tonight from our chat room that kind of gets into this a little bit.
And our first chat comment tonight comes from our buddy Derek H., who actually hosts another show here on AllGames.com, Dead Pixel Live, which would technically be the next show on after Orange Lounge Radio.
Just you have to wait until Monday.
Derek H says, $130, it's Catch-22.
To be worth it, you'd need to have a lot of friends, but if you have a lot of friends, you're not a person who spends $130 on a video game.
I don't know, though.
I get the funny he's trying to make there, but what about Rock Band?
Rock Band's a party game.
I don't know.
I looked at it.
I thought about it.
But I went with it.
I went for it, and you know what?
I'm not regretting it.
It sounds like you had people over to play this game.
Well, at work, yeah.
We checked it out and stuff like that.
I had it hooked up for an entire day and that kind of thing.
Yeah, it's fun.
I am looking forward to it.
Really, I could just skip paying the extra $200 or $100.
I'm not buying the Renegade Edition, that's for sure.
I have a bag to carry the system in.
And you know what?
I don't really need a table to play it on because I played it in my lap just fine.
So don't buy it, especially if you don't like rap music like me.
I'm not really huge into hip-hop and rap music, so not for me.
But yeah, I am planning on picking it up because...
I've been working on that.
and DarkSakura.com
Also, need to move it in the house.
Oh, and install Windows and stuff onto my actual PC.
Because I actually had to custom build a PC to...
DarkSakura
So you can see there, like, I had to drill three more holes for, like, additional buttons.
And then if you scroll all the way to the bottom there, you can see... Boy, did you make a mess of your garage.
Oh, the garage is a mess, yeah.
I remember when you moved in, that was pristine.
Okay, sorry.
I just... No.
So I had to drill new buttons, but that's the piece here.
It's a huge... But it's all mounted to a piece of wood.
I had to make custom buttons and stuff like that.
I will post this to our Twitter feed if you're okay with that.
I already posted a link to my Twitter.
Folks listening on the podcast can go back and check that out if they want to see it.
Very cool.
Some questions from chat.
TigerClaw wants to know, so you mounted a motherboard to it.
What about cooling?
Are there any vents on the back, an extra amount of fans?
No, I don't think that I really need all that stuff.
I mean, the cabinet's pretty open in the inside anyways.
I mean, there's a fan on the processor, fan on the graphics card, but I don't think it's going to get too hot because I'm really not... I mean, MAME, I don't think it's going to strain that processor too much.
So we'll see.
If I need to put a fan in there, I can.
But, I mean, I don't know.
I don't think it needs it.
I think it'll be fine.
But we'll play it by ear.
I just put that on the Twitter, by the way.
So there you go.
Anything else, Loki?
That's it.
My Gaming Week.
I've actually had some time to play some games this week.
I just want to point this out, and I know I'm going to get criticized by a lot of folks.
I still haven't fixed the 360.
I kind of don't need to right now.
I've totally been happy in my gaming world with World of Warcraft, of course, and PlayStation 3.
I...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Here's the thing, though.
Demon's Souls is not for everybody.
From what I hear.
It is hard.
I've dropped probably four or five hours in this game.
I've rolled three different characters.
I've beaten the tutorial level, and I consistently get my ass handed to me in the first level.
It is that hard of a game.
This game is the Mega Man 9
of roleplaying games.
Although I don't want to think roleplaying games as like Final Fantasy roleplaying games because it's more of an action-y RPG.
Think a little more like Oblivion in the third person.
This game is so hardcore, it's like D&D.
I mean, you have to consider everything.
You have to consider the weights of the weapons you're carrying, all these different statistics.
There's no pause.
There is no pause in this game because the game's online.
Um, and this is the interesting thing.
This is the part that makes Demon's Souls fascinating is the online component because it's not an MMO.
It's not a single player role playing game.
Let me give you an idea of the types of stuff you do in this game.
You can leave markings on the ground that have little messages for other people, but you can't type in your own messages.
Sorry, Loki.
You have to choose from like a predetermined set that's kind of works like a Mad Lib.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
You might suddenly see a message pop on your screen.
Your message has been rated up and you get a little bit of life point back.
Which is good because otherwise you can't really get it back very easily.
And then if it sucks, well your message just never shows up in other people's worlds.
The less it gets rated, the less it just goes away.
The other component is that you'll have bloodstains.
When people die in the world, their bloodstain appears and you can touch the bloodstain and watch how they died.
That's awesome.
Which is kind of interesting.
It helps you learn lessons because there's little surprises around every corner and all this stuff.
So here's the thing, though.
Here's how unforgiving the game is.
The currency of the game is souls.
You get souls by beating monsters.
If you die in a level, you go all the way back to start.
You lose all your souls, all of them, and the whole level starts over.
If you can get back to where your blood stain was and touch it, you get all your souls back.
If you die again, you're fucked.
It's gone.
You lose everything.
This game is not messing around.
It is a very, very difficult game.
When I say it is the Mega Man 9 of role-playing games, I'm not kidding.
Because you know how Mega Man 9 is?
You have to go in, you have to die, die, die, and learn a distinct pattern in how to beat the level.
And then once you learn the pattern to beat the level, it's never a problem again.
Right?
That's very similar to what this game is.
Because as I'm going through the level... Oh, demon hiding behind the wood.
Oh, demon hiding around the corner.
Oh, two demons over here.
You start to learn the patterns.
It just is difficult still for me because a lot of it has to do with timing.
If you want to beat really hard enemies, you have to be able to block and then basically jab your sword into the enemy.
It gets really hard.
So...
I'm just saying, this game is not fucking around with the difficulty.
So if you think you're going to throw a controller across the room, you probably will.
And that's where you might need to decide if this game's worth dropping $60 on or not.
Because I think the challenge is this game's biggest asset and it's its game's biggest drawback.
It's our type.
is it a rewarding experience though?
heck yeah, because it feels really good when you are able to successfully beat a level and get past a point you've never got before that's a reward you haven't really seen since like 8-bit gaming days one other thing I do want to say about online mode I haven't gotten to this part myself but apparently this gets in later on after you beat the first couple levels is that when you die or I guess some of the stains on the floor start being that you can warp yourself
into someone else's world and help them beat the boss.
Or you can go into someone else's world as a black phantom and try to kill them.
So now you can be the enemy in someone else's world.
And you get rewarded if you kill the other player.
But here's the other thing to keep in mind.
There is no friends list in this game.
There is no voice chat in the game.
It is all anonymous.
So when you're the black phantom, you're a silent killer.
They don't even know who killed them.
and the tricky thing about being the phantom is that if you're just out there, I think they purposely make the phantoms a little weaker, but if you know the levels, if you've really worked at the levels and you kind of know the good hiding spaces like around corners and stuff, you can just beat the shit out of somebody that you storm in their level.
Loki, I think you would sit there all day and be the black phantom on people's levels and have fun with it.
You should see me play Grand Theft Auto, man.
I
What we've been doing now, we have random people coming into our games.
Because we do ranked games now.
So basically, if you sign on to a ranked game when we're online playing a ranked game, or in the lobby, you will be in our ranked game.
And then I will mock you on our end.
Because no one realizes that all five of us, or four of us, are in the same room.
So we'll be like, okay, he's coming around the corner.
Boom!
Just knock the guy down.
Not really gang up on them, but we'll help each other.
Oh man, I talk shit when other people are in there.
It's awesome.
Go into some comments from our chat, chat.orangelonsradio.com Kitsune says, by that means they can come into your world and kill you.
Yes, they can.
I am told the game warns you when a black phantom has entered your level, but it doesn't tell you anything beyond that.
and let's see, HitStun says this sounds awesome, too bad it's a PS3 exclusive, that's actually my point HitStun, that's why I said kind of before I went into this story, you know, Sony's finally gaining some ground moving into this holiday season, you know Sony PS3 has had some great exclusives, for the platformers they have LittleBigPlanet, for the first person shooters they have Resistance, now they have something for the action RPGers and that's Demon's Souls, and to some extent you could say Valkyria Chronicles 2, although that's more of a, you know, um
Why can't I think of the name all of a sudden?
The strategy, RTS game, thank you.
Leo Shen wants to know how far did I get?
Dude, I can't even beat Bolteria Palace 1-1.
That's how hard this game is.
Like, I keep getting killed by the blue-eyed guy.
But I'm trying.
I keep re-rolling characters to think it can... I actually hear...
the easiest way through it is with the royalty character because even though they start at the lowest level they have the soul arrow so that's what I'm trying to do now but I'm finding it makes you really weak so I got gang raped by two fire wielding guys like I can't even get back to where I was with my soldier so whoo
Anyhow, Demon's Souls is the name of the game.
One other game I do want to mention that I played, another PS3 exclusive, go figure, Katamari Forever on the PlayStation 3.
I did pick up this week, finally.
It's a little cheaper than Demon's Souls.
Demon's Souls sent me back $60.
I believe Katamari Forever was...
Thank you for watching!
and some of the other online games I've been missing out on while my 360's been broken.
But I will say Katamari Forever is really cool.
I love the way it controls.
The music is cute, having it back in the levels.
I have to admit I haven't fully explored the game because I've been kind of a little busy playing Demon's Souls and getting killed in that game.
But I'm already having more fun with this than I was the 360 version of the game, even though this admittedly is a rehash of, you know, a lot of the levels.
But what I like is that they do put new elements in the levels.
You can go back and play the old levels as the old levels if you want.
And to be honest, I haven't played the game in so long that, you know, all the levels are feeling new to me again after, you know, two, three years of not playing it.
But I do think the price point may be a little high, considering that a lot of it is recycled.
If you've never played Katamari Damacy before, though, this is a really good entry-level game.
If you have all the other games, you might want to wait for a price drop.
I just think for a lot of folks, $50, unless you're a hardcore fan of the series, you're going to be like, come on, too much.
So, there you go.
All right, so that was pretty much my gaming week.
I did play some other stuff, but I've talked too much about the other games.
I want to get into some gaming news.
I know you guys do too.
We're going to get into it.
First off, some housekeeping real quick.
The podcast feed is behind.
I'm sorry about that, but vacations will do that.
I did get 338 on the feed tonight, so all that's left is 339 in the mini show.
So those will go up this week before this week's show does.
DarkSakura.com
That's really it.
Otherwise, go ahead and add us on Twitter.
We are soon going to have a new Facebook fan page.
I know we have our Facebook forums, but we're actually going to work on building a fan page so that way we can notify you about new shows in your friend feed if you want.
If you don't want it, add us anyway and then block our updates, whatever.
But we're going to actually work on an official Orange Launch Radio page that will hopefully be open this week.
And then, of course, we still have our live journal, our website, orangelaunchradio.com, and so forth.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Epic Mickey has been confirmed via the newest Game Informer.
It's on the cover.
And, of course, they have the inside story about that as well.
The game is being done by War Inspector.
And it's actually pretty sweet looking.
It takes place kind of in this dark Disney-type world where Mickey will actually be facing up against some forgotten Disney characters who are all really...
Thanks for watching!
Thank you for watching!
It's a pretty epic looking RPG.
Have we seen much outside of the one screenshot that's on the magazine cover?
They've had artwork put out from it and it looks really dark.
I'm almost surprised it's even on the Wii.
Well, you know, the Wii's kind of needed something like Epic Mickey, so I get it, and I'm going to give it a chance.
You know, I think a lot of people are like, boo, this isn't coming to 360 or PS3, you know, it can't be that epic.
But I'm saying, wait a minute, give this a chance, because what this game's trying to do is fill a niche that the Wii doesn't have.
Because the Wii right now is known as a shovelware system, with the occasional awesome Metroid or Mario game.
I mean, right?
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
I don't know when this is going to be coming out.
If it's spring of next year, it might be too early.
Maybe they don't have time to work with development kits for Natal or whatever they're calling the PlayStation 3 motion controller.
We'll see more of these games later on.
And who's to say that they couldn't, if this is really popular, do a sequel, be on all platforms, or even port this later on.
So I wouldn't rule it out.
Well, here's my thing, though.
What's wrong with Kingdom Hearts?
I mean, isn't Kingdom Hearts, in a way, Epic Mickey?
No.
I mean, I realize that games are going to be different.
I realize this is not going to be a role-playing game or what have you.
But I kind of look at this and go, is this going to kill off Kingdom Hearts?
Because that's kind of too bad.
Because Kingdom Hearts, I always thought, was kind of an epic Mickey.
I mean, yeah.
I mean, they can coexist.
I hope so.
But, I mean, there was always those rumors that Kingdom Hearts 3, whenever it actually happens, was going to do away with the Disney.
I mean, is that what we're looking at?
Now that Disney is over here?
I mean, I guess we don't know until we really get some final words on Kingdom Hearts 3.
But...
I'm not really sure.
I never played the DS version that just came out, so...
X-Link confirms yes, there is a lot in the games.
So whatever I heard about Disney being fade out.
Fazed Out is just a sick rumor.
Although, I will tell you, being at Disneyland twice in the past month
There isn't a lot of Kingdom Hearts.
In fact, there is no Kingdom Hearts references in either park.
Which, you know, I understand because Square Enix, that's really their thing.
But you would think, you know, it still raises Disney awareness.
It's kind of a bummer they don't have at least like a Sora something to buy, you know.
Well, it looks like though this game is going to be more like Disney Park stuff because they show kind of in the...
Thanks for watching!
Thanks for watching!
But is it going to be dark in like a... I mean, let's face it, there's a lot of dark things at Disneyland now.
It's Halloween time there.
They have Haunted Mansion.
I guess it would... The Ghost Galaxy, if I were a little kid, would be freaked out by it.
As an adult, I think it's funny.
I think it's dark as in like, you know, the toys.
I guess, like, you know, in Toy Story, how they had the toys that the neighbor kid put together and they're all creepy looking like the baby doll head.
I can't believe Disney would allow that.
That just seems weird to me.
BlackWolf says, I do know that Square and Disney don't like each other, at least in the US.
Kitsune says, even at Tokyo Disney, nothing from Kingdom Hearts.
I guess Kitsune's been there recently.
Tigerclaw says, oh my, I would imagine during the It's a Small World level, the gamers will be tortured with that music playing on repeat.
Here's some concept art that they had for Epic Mickey.
It was kind of very steampunk-ish.
They have this ship thing with Epcot on there.
They've got some characters running around and machines and stuff.
There's Goofy right there that looks like a zombie almost.
Some like twisted, I don't even know what that is.
You know what this is?
This is like the Return to Oz of Disney.
Did anyone ever see Return to Oz when they were kids?
It was awesome.
And read the books too.
In the 80s?
Dude, okay, for those that never saw Return to Oz back in the 80s, because I was like 7 when this movie came out, which means half our listeners weren't even born.
But here's the thing is that, okay, when Return to Oz came out, first off, Feruza Balk was Dorothy.
And if you don't know who she is, she was like the twisted chick in The Craft.
I don't know what else she's been in lately.
But she was in American History X, I think, and something else.
Okay, she was Dorothy.
And like the movie started out with her in an insane asylum, right?
And she goes to this area where...
The Witch, whoever she was, the bad witch, and y'all forgive me, my details of the story are scattered, maybe Jamie can help.
She was another princess.
Oh, was she another princess?
She collected heads in jars.
Of pretty women.
Yeah, she was after Dorothy's head to get, so she was like, and you would actually see like the heads in jars and things, and like you saw all your favorite like, um...
Characters from The Wizard of Oz turned to stone and frozen in time, and it was a very dark-looking world.
And this was, I believe, a movie Disney put out, wasn't it?
Maybe.
Yeah, well, even that, though, the characters that pick up along the way, like Tick Tock, he was a different clockwork man, and he looked a bit more... But when they brought in the Scarecrow and Tin Man and all of them, they looked very...
They look like the old book.
If I remember right, this movie took so long to come out because MGM had to lose the rights to make the future Oz movies.
And I think Disney put this one out.
So it was really weird that it was kind of a darker movie.
So, you know, Disney is capable of doing darker things.
It is just surprising that it would be...
Thanks for watching!
Anyways, so yeah, really creepy shit that's in all these concept things, and so I hope they stick to it.
I mean, I hope they stick to their guns and try something risky, because you know what?
You can put out a game for Disney's Princess and the Frog, and it may sell X number of copies or whatever, and that's fine.
But you know what?
Do something ballsy, and you know what?
They'll get a good return on it.
I don't know.
Maybe a California adventure.
Maybe.
Alright.
Anyhow.
Kitsune, by the way, had never heard of Return to Oz, I guess, and is very excited about the movie.
Put the trailer in chat and says, somehow this feels like Labyrinth.
Well, it came out around that same time.
It does feel kind of like Labyrinth.
It was a lot like Labyrinth.
I mean, this was that time in the 80s when you had NeverEnding Story, Labyrinth, Dark Crystal, Return to Oz.
They all came out right around the same time.
They were all in that mid-early 80s phase, so...
The golden age of adventure movies.
Of fucking up children's minds.
Seriously.
Those are some fucked up movies we had as a kid.
Say my name!
And then you never really understood what the hell her name was.
I never got that.
They said what it was.
I used to know.
Crap, I'll have to look it up again.
I think we even tried turning on the subtitles once to find out what her goddamn name was.
And it said Untangible or something.
or Scream's name
This is a project that's known as a lot of different names according to the survey.
Game Room, Retrocade, Tower of Rom, Classics Live.
Tower of Rom is kind of awesome, although I don't see that being the actual name.
I think Retrocade or Classics Live sound a lot more realistic.
Anyhow...
They're saying that this is something that I guess looks a lot like PlayStation Home, but they're not calling it PlayStation Home.
It's just something where the 360 avatars are in there and they're kind of walking around and...
Yeah, they're playing arcade games.
That's all we really know based on the survey.
We don't know to the full extent what the interactivity is here.
But you look at one of these screenshots and you can see like two levels of video games with the avatars around.
And when I look at the titles of the games, they look like they might actually be like old school games.
Like that little graphic there, that's an Intellivision graphic.
That little guy there is from the Intellivision series.
And it looks like the name of the game there is like baseball from Intellivision.
They have Atari, yeah.
Yeah, it has the Atari logos.
So I don't know what the deal is going on here, if maybe this is like old school 80s games, Atari and Intellivision coming out, or what it is.
But could be interesting.
I don't know, what would you guys like to see in regards to retroness on the 360?
I think it'd be cool to have something like that.
Or that would be even kind of cool instead of like home, you know, just go walk around and play like arcade games.
Hmm.
Instead of, you know, watching Twilight trailers.
Right.
I gotta say though, doing this at home, going into a virtual space to launch a game, isn't that exciting?
It's one of those things that seems a lot cooler when you hear about it.
It's kind of irritating, isn't it?
Yeah, so I gotta wonder, what is gonna make this cool?
Why am I gonna wanna go into this little front end with all the little avatars?
Beer would make it cool.
Achievement points.
Oh lord.
You have found a game!
Achievement point!
You have sneezed!
Achievement point.
Sadly, you're probably right.
No, hey, I got an idea.
Well, it wouldn't really work with the classic games so much, but like, you could have, you know, say, redemption games, and you earn tickets or whatever, and you can redeem stuff for your avatar, like costumes and crap.
What if... You might be onto something here.
What if Xbox Live charged you like 10 cents to play for one play of these games that might redeem... You know, because there was other news this week, and I know Bobby talked about it on his show.
I didn't make the cut for our show, but they talked about the sports jerseys.
I know he talked about it on his show.
The sports jerseys made their way to Xbox Live this week at $4 a pop for the jerseys.
I know he was surveying his listeners tonight about would they pay for that or not.
Do you think there would be any interest in putting in $0.10, $0.25 to play a game and possibly unlock something from the game?
Do you think people would do that?
I think people would bite at that.
There are consumer whores out there.
I would try it, just to try it.
And if the game's fine, I might play it a couple times.
I think that a quarter would be... Well, I think that it should be along the lines of, oh, play this, and if you decide that you want it permanently, then you might pay for demo.
Well, either way, you know it's going to be their virtual money anyway.
Yeah.
So, alright.
Well, anyhow, it's going to be interesting to see what comes of that.
Of course, it could be nothing.
It could just be a survey.
We'll see.
DarkSakura.
Well, for other... I guess we can sort of call this nostalgic even though it's an ongoing series.
But there's the Poppin' Music Portable.
It's supposed to be coming out on PSP with the nine-button mode and everything.
But it looks like there's going to be a story mode in it.
and so because you can go around like sort of a board game map thingy like Mario Party ish and you go that way to unlock you know new songs and things but this is sort of makes me think of like you know the pop music I have pop music 7 where you play through as the little superhero guy at the end of the thing like a board game and you unlock stuff like it's sort of more like an old RPG but
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
But with a controller that looks like nine pop-o-matic bubbles from the game Trouble And they're kind of laid out in a five on the bottom, four on the top pattern And you use these to play songs, like a la Guitar Hero, basically How in the hell is this going to translate to PSP?
I guess...
DJ Max is really popular on PSP and other countries.
Even here, to some extent, has a cult following here.
I guess these type of button beat games are okay.
Would this game ever come out in the U.S., though?
I don't know.
How desperate is Konami for money?
That's really the question.
You would think, though, now that it's all going digital distribution, how hard would it be for them to just slap it up on the download and let it be?
Minimal localization for that.
Right, but do you think they'll still do it?
Probably not.
No, they're leaving.
Sad.
Unfortunately.
Anyway.
Alright, well, I guess we'll see if a controller comes out for this game or not, but probably not.
But the story modes, hey, this game already sounds better than Poppin' Music Wii, and we are getting that here in America.
And it's already better than whatever Beatin' Groovy.
Oh, don't get me started.
DJ Hero will be coming out in a couple weeks and the full song list has been released by Activision and features 93 tracks with 100 different songs composing those tracks and some of the neat little things I thought I'd mention some of the tracks we have here that I thought were interesting
Um, let's see.
Of course, you may remember the remix that I did, Shout vs. Eric Pryde's Piano.
Well, there's also going to be two other Shout remixes as well.
Tears for Fears, Shout vs. DJ Shadow's Six Days, a remix featuring Mos Def, and Shout vs. Eric B. and Rakim.
Eric B. is the president.
That one is mixed by DJ Jazzy Jeff.
All completely different sounding.
Um...
Ice Ice Baby vs. Paul Abdul Straight Up
If that's not your kind of thing, there may be some Herbie Hancock Rocket.
They've got a Beat Juggle version of that and also Rocket vs. Nerds Lap Dance.
That one's produced by Grandmaster Flash.
And then Foreigner, Jukebox Hero vs. DJ Z-Trip featuring MERS, DJ Hero.
And that's, I guess, produced and mixed by DJ Z-Trip.
and then some of the songs that we'll be hearing tonight later on.
Foreigner, Jukebox Hero, only live for our live listeners during break.
Foo Fighters, Monkey Wrench vs. BC Boy Sabotage, the DJ guitar mix.
And then also, what do we got here?
Boom Boom Pow by Black Eyed Peas and Satisfaction by Benny Banassi.
and lots more stuff.
You can check out the full track list.
It's online everywhere.
Lots of good songs.
I'm very excited to play all these.
Now, we're actually going to give DJ Hero a little spin here in studio quick.
I don't think we're going to play all the songs because of copyright.
We'll just play maybe a minute or so, but just if you kind of want to hear what this game sounds like.
And it's going to be tricky because I kind of want Loki to describe, or I guess maybe I'll describe kind of what he's doing.
This is going to be weird radio, but can we plug in DJ Hero and get some of the noise out on the feed here?
And I'm going to kind of describe what Loki's doing as he's playing this game.
Where are the audio ties?
Oh, they're down there.
Are those them?
Or is that where they're... Okay.
Hold on, guys.
Live radio.
We're actually plugging in the audio for DJ Hero right now.
Can you turn it down a little bit?
Okay.
Did that take down my mics too?
Or...
Okay, sorry guys, we're adjusting the audio live here.
So, alright.
So here we go.
So Loki's going to hit start.
I don't hear anything either.
Oh, there it is.
Very quiet.
There we go.
Sorry guys, I know this isn't the most interesting radio in the world, but right now there's a menu here.
Learn to DJ, Quick Play, Single DJ.
That's what Loki picked.
And in this demo we have Marvin Gaye vs. Gorillaz, Gwen Stefani vs. Rick James, and Black Eyed Peas vs. Benny Banassi.
and you can actually see it shows you on the screen who is presenting the track it shows what's called the intensity which this is low and the duration 3 minutes and 48 seconds for the song that Loki currently has selected and then you can actually see performance on different levels I don't know if that shows how well Loki's done or what that is showing there do we have the audio?
when you're talking over it I think it's not
Is the connection bad?
There you go.
I think those wires are just weird.
Uh-oh, is there a mixing board?
That's not good.
Sorry, guys.
The reason why you're hearing it bounce from left to right, those of you listening live, our podcasts are mono.
But Loki's doing one at a time here.
Uh-oh.
We're having the board just in bad shape.
There you go.
Don't touch it.
Just play.
Did the audio already go out?
Ah, crap.
Alright, well, maybe we won't get to play it live tonight.
We will later.
You're going to fix it for later?
Alright, so we just won't get to play during the show for the podcasters.
That was a waste of time.
Sorry, guys.
Are you working on that now?
Alright, alright.
Fair enough.
I don't know what to talk about here in the meantime.
Should I just go on to the next story?
We'll come back?
Yeah, we'll do that.
I'm going to go on to the next story and we'll come back.
The next story has to do with the Wii Balance Board.
And the Wii Balance Board apparently is now being used in some airport screening.
Now, this is only a study.
It's not actually something you're going to go to the airport and see right now.
But apparently, the U.S.
government has invested some money into actually looking at using the Wii Balance Board in airport screening.
So this is according to a CNN report.
This is one of a couple of experimental methods that are being used right now to see who is suspicious at the airport.
This is being done by scientists that are part of the Future Attribute Screening Technology, or FAST program.
They're actually using the Wii Fit Peripheral to see how somebody shifts their weight.
They're trying to find, quote, a level of fidgeting that would suggest the need for a secondary screening.
So they're using the Wii balance board, I guess it's something that you would kind of step on before you go through the gate to see if you are really fidgety while you're going into the airport.
That's kind of weird to me because what if you're just old?
and you just shake a lot.
I mean, wouldn't that set off some red flags?
I don't know about you guys, but I don't think this is something you're actually going to see at an airport for quite some time.
You certainly wouldn't see a Wii balance board, that's for sure.
Would you see that type of technology embedded into a mat that you step on before you go through the terminal?
Sure.
But are you going to see the Wii balance board itself out there?
Heck no.
That's just going to look dumb.
Besides, those things are kind of thin.
And don't forget the Wii balance board only supports up to like 300 or 350 pounds.
That doesn't include everybody that you need to screen at an airport.
So, you know, if anything else, they may have to take the same technology and use it in some other new device.
Although I don't know why seeing the balance of somebody is going to show if they're a terrorist or not.
That seems a little silly to me.
I have this bad feeling that this whole thing was just a footnote on some other study that people are taking way too seriously.
Yeah, an ex-link in chat says, old person with MS sues airport.
Yeah, I could see that.
I could see that happening.
How we doing, Loki?
We okay?
Loki's got some new plugs he's gonna try.
Like I said, I wanted to try this the first time.
This is the way he wanted to do it the first time, I guess.
Of course, I'm not hearing anything.
Oh.
Those plugs there are bad.
Do you have another red and white set you can use besides those plugs?
Only on live radio could this happen, boys and girls.
What about the gray cords?
There's gray cords in the box that we used to use.
Those will extend.
Okay, we're trying to right now extend... Will that even work?
Okay, he says yes.
And hopefully these plugs will be a little better.
And that's what Loki is putting in right now.
As we try to demo DJ Hero for you guys here on Orange On Radio.
Much better!
Alright!
Okay.
Okay.
DJ Ranma S, Actdeft
Alright, so the song is currently loading.
And there's a tip on the screen.
Rewinds are a great way to earn a big score.
Try them in a section you know well.
And it's showing him a little bit about how to play the game.
There's a euphoria button, an effects dial.
Alright, so this is Marvin Gaye versus Gorillaz.
He's laying down the track.
Here we go.
And right now he's hitting buttons on the controller in time with the beats as they fall.
But he's also moving the crossfader back and forth as you see it on the green and the blue sides.
I don't know if he's holding the button down when he does that.
But when he sees these little arrows on the track, he actually has to be scratching.
I want this remix, like, really bad.
And Loki's actually having to hold down the green or the blue button when he scratches.
Because they're scratching on both the green and the blue track.
Watch me as I grab it.
Watch me as I... Close down this... Showdown you... Can't fight with us.
Showdown you... So...
What was that in the middle?
Oh, freestyle?
He just blared a horn.
Very interesting.
Alright, I don't know if we can play much more here.
I'm gonna catch off Loki.
Can you just pause it?
Or fail it, or whatever?
Alright, there he is.
He's going to pause it there.
You will get to hear the whole thing of that on break later.
But unfortunately for the podcast, we have to cut it off because we don't want to get sued by the makers of DJ Hero.
So we used a little bit there for critical review purposes only, as we're allowed to do.
So, there you go.
Interesting.
Yeah, it is a bummer we don't have TV.
I don't know what exciting radio that made, but at least I was able to get a feel for the game.
Now I kind of want to play.
Yeah, it looks like fun.
I'll have to play later.
Alright.
Alright.
Anyhow, we'll get into more DJ Hero here in a little bit, but we have some more news.
DarkSakura's going to take us to our next story.
I am.
Well, I guess I am.
For fans of Beatles Rock Band, there is an actual download content plan in store, but it's based on how well the next three sets of download content go.
They, um... Because the process for doing everything for Beatles Rock Band is expensive and intensive because it's not just like, you know, mastering one song in.
You have to send off the original tape and redo it and bring it back in and have level animation and whatnot ready for it because it has to fit in with their whole, I guess, branding or whatever, the feel of the game.
It has to fit the identity of the game.
So they want to see how everything sells first.
Right now, of course, the only downloadable content is All You Need Is Love.
but on October 20th we're getting Abbey Road which will be 1360 Microsoft points or 160 points per track and then we get Sgt.
Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band and Rubber Soul which Rubber Soul is my favorite just saying great album I had it on vinyl and of course those are coming out in November and December respectively
So, I think it makes sense, you know, because it is really a lot of work to go, that goes into it, not just, you know, for having to master the tracks, but like I said, you've got to make sure that the animations lined up, that, you know, everything is going to fit the feel of the rest of the game, which is why you can't, you know, go in and play Aerosmith on Beatles Rock Band or something like that.
You know, even though that would be kind of fun.
That would be in Guitar Hero.
Yeah, well, you know what I mean, as an example.
Well, you know, you can't expect that there's going to be new content every week for the Beatles rock band.
I mean, obviously, there's a very limited catalog to what they can pick from.
And, of course, you know, you're talking about old music.
You're talking about very protected, very delicate, you know, world icon music that, you know, has got to be scrutinized very carefully.
It makes sense why this is not going to be a floodgate worth of material.
And, honestly, you know, if the game enough...
I don't think the download content is going to give you anything that's going to make you go OMG must buy this game.
If the game enough wasn't good enough, forget it.
But it would be nice to see them pour some more stuff out here.
My thought on this is that there are actually a number of songs in the home game that are just a few that I'm really not familiar with.
and certain songs in different eras are ones that are not on my list of favorites I like a lot of the mid to older stuff better
But isn't it like maybe exposing you to stuff you haven't heard from a band that is so iconic?
I'll put it this way.
I've at least heard most of the songs in the game once at least.
But I don't really look at it as being a new kind of exposure.
It's just that I would rather have some of my favorites.
Although I wonder how they're doing some of the ones that didn't have a drum track or didn't have a...
any guitar there's like for example Eleanor Rigby only had strings so maybe you put your guitar up to your neck and play like it's a violin I'm joking of course you just probably play sort of like a let's talk more rock instead of keytar you have you know violin rock
Vanessa May
NBA 2K10 is coming out on PC.
I guess it got delayed from the rest of them.
Cars, Racerama, pretty much coming out on everything.
Squeeball's Party on the Wii and DS.
You may remember this was the game that was supposed to have a Wii remote type of controller for the Xbox 360.
That version got cancelled, unfortunately.
But you can pick it up on the rest of the systems.
Also, the kind of a Grey's Hits edition of Midnight Club Los Angeles is coming out.
The complete edition with the download content intact and for the Grey's Hits price.
Pets Pony Beauty Pageant for the DS.
SingStar Latino coming out on PlayStation 2.
That's interesting.
Didn't know that was coming over here.
Ju-On, The Grudge, Haunted House Simulator for the Wii.
Making its way out this week.
Africa on PS3, which apparently has been getting horrible reviews.
It's about time that game comes out, though.
How long have we been waiting for that?
Where the Wild Things Are, coming out, tying in with the new movie.
And that'll be on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Wii, and DS.
Maybe PSP.
Magna Carta 2, coming out on Xbox 360.
SingStar Motown, coming out on PlayStation 3.
Also another game I was unaware of.
Hero Saga, Leviathan...
Elevathan Tactics coming out on DS Mario and Sonic at the Olympic Winter Games on the Wii and DS this week Brutal Legend making its way out on Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 kind of go along with epic games like that Uncharted 2 Among Thieves coming out this week on PlayStation 3
Half Minute Hero coming out on PlayStation Portable.
That'll be pretty awesome.
If you haven't bought Fallout 3 yet, Fallout 3 Game of the Year Edition with all the download content with it for $60.
That's coming out on Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, and PC.
Way of the Samurai on Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 this week.
Grand Theft Auto Chinatown Wars on PSP.
Sudoku Ball Detective on the Wii.
Buck Fever on the Wii, and a boy and his blob on the Wii.
That's going to be awesome.
Really?
Yeah.
Boy, that came out of the radar, didn't it?
I actually saw something for that a little earlier today.
I thought I'd seen something on one of the blogs, but I got the impression this game was still in development.
I didn't realize it was coming out now.
It's ready to go.
Interesting.
Agatha Christie's ABC Murders coming out on DS this week.
Woohoo.
Yeah.
I hope Angela Lansbury does some voice acting in that.
I'm a big fan.
And that's it.
Alright, Japanese release dates are not here this week.
We'll get back to those next week.
So apologies to those folks looking for the releases in Japan, but my resource is not working right now.
So we'll have to just skip over to Euro release dates, right?
What we have is Brutal Legend on the 16th for PS3 and Xbox 360, Harvest Fishing, yay, Magna Carta 2, Mario & Luigi Bowser's Inside Story, which actually that sounds pretty fun to me.
Playing as a...
Big ol' lizard guy.
You're playing inside of him.
Yeah.
The nose and rump command.
That sounds funny.
Mario and Sonic at the Olympic Winter Games on the 16th.
And Ninja Captains, as well as Tropico 3.
Oh, and also Uncharted 2 Among Thieves.
That'd be all.
Arrgh.
Uncharted Uncharted
Okay, so you may not be having trouble with your vision, but hey, who says that you can't improve upon what you already have?
And apparently a company that makes gaming glasses is looking to do that.
The new glasses are called Gunner Optics, and they're designed to improve your gaming performance.
Apparently they have some special coating and tints to them, and apparently they do everything from reducing glare to blocking out evaporative air currents.
Okay, basically to me they look like shooting glasses, but just with a fancier frame.
They kind of have that same yellow tint to them.
The prices are $100, and apparently Ars Technica took them out for a test drive and actually found out that they do what they say.
They actually did have an effect during prolonged gaming sessions.
Whether that's worth the $100 or not is, I guess, your decision, but they look neat.
You know, I guess a little bit geek-chic.
I don't know.
Maybe if I... I don't know, I might look good in glasses.
I'm not going to drop $100 on glasses, though.
Let me see these.
Well, you know, a good pair of regular glasses will cost you several hundred dollars, so... Mine cost $430.
I mean, that's why people have vision insurance, but... And if it's just yellow tint, I have yellow tinted glasses I bought for $10 that are basically this same thing, except without the fancy frame.
And, you know...
Maybe I should try those, except I don't like running around with those because... Well, didn't some big website put this on a study and vouch for it?
I mean, so there's got to be something more there, Loki.
I don't think this is something you can just get the tinted lenses at the 98 cent clearance center and run with, you know?
Well, not necessarily those, but like, you know, shooting glasses.
I use them for... Well, I bought them for airsofting, but they're dangerous to wear airsofting because, you know, it...
Thanks for watching!
Well, according to TigerClaw in our chatroom, chat.orange.com, apparently Dead Pixel Live, another show here on allgames.com, had an interview with the folks that made these glasses.
And Derek H. just wants to say they do put magic stuff in them to make them work.
And I'm assuming you won't be able to find the magic stuff in your $10 frames.
So there's something special in there.
It's called crack.
and Bochikawa also wears yellow tinted plastic for Airsoft.
Alright, anyhow.
Moving on to one more game news story here and then we're getting into the classic game of the week.
PSP Minis
$2,500 so you might see a game here on a PSP that you see on the iPhone as well and it costs more on the PSP and the whole reason why is the ESRB and something I didn't think of before is that the ESRB
You don't have to get a rating from that for the iPhone game, surprisingly enough.
Isn't that something you think that's going to come to a head later on?
Isn't that just a bag of uh-oh waiting to be opened?
No, not really, because if you think about it, they kind of go through their own review process through Apple.
And really, it's Apple as a platform that determines whether they want to put games on their platform that have an ESRB rating or not.
And if they say, yeah, we'll take whatever, even if it doesn't have a rating or not,
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
The hell with you.
Interesting point from Xlink in chat.
Kids don't have an iPhone.
Adults do.
But what about... I know kids with iPhones.
Yeah.
What the hell are you talking about?
What about an iTouch, too?
I mean, he makes a good point, but an iTouch, you don't have to have a phone contract for.
That sounds dirty, Rob.
Well, that's true, though.
The apps are for the iTouch, too.
It's an iPod Touch.
At least they don't have a kid's version called iTouch Kids, because that would be bad.
Fine, iPod Touch.
Sorry, I thought it was an iTouch.
Whatever.
Shut up.
All right.
I gotta do a story.
Yes, I know.
What's that?
Down the line.
I can't shut up yet.
No.
All right.
Anyhow, I just wanted to say, though, real quick, that if you wonder why the PSP minis are more expensive, that is something the developers are citing as kind of their excuse, for lack of a better term.
So there you go.
Alright, we're going to get into another segment we like to do here on Orange Lounge Radio.
Every week is kind of our Part B segment, so to speak.
And it's a part where DarkSakura gets to climb through her gaming vault and find a game that, you know what, she thinks you guys ought to be playing.
And it's a segment we like to call the Classic Video Game of the Week.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
I'm not doing anything extra internet-y.
We may not.
There we go.
I just picked random level music.
Anyway, Super Mario RPG is an adventure and role-playing game that's put out by Square back in the day and Nintendo.
It came out in Japan on March 9, 1996 and on May 13, 1996 in North America.
Europe did not get it.
Not until it came out on the Virtual Console, August 22, 2008, which, according to this reference, is the longest difference in time between release dates in Nintendo's history.
So... I had to change the YouTube.
Sorry, the other one wasn't loading right.
So, here we go.
Oh, okay.
Okay.
Anyway, this was made pretty much all in-house by Square, with guidance from Miyamoto.
So, big deal.
The battle system in this game was pretty cool.
It's very similar to Chrono Trigger, so that it's action-based, but you don't necessarily just stick in your monster battles.
It does play rather isometrically.
um and you can see your enemies and you can't you know you don't fight with one until you run into one so that's what I mean by Chrono Trigger like you know but with your battle system you can play Mario, Mallow, Geno, Bowser or Princess Toadstool and they all of course have their own attacks and it is turn based um this traditional turn based system um but you do have timed button presses um
And of course you have items and stuff.
But yeah, with the game, you go visit all the Toad people, and you have Moleville, and a monster town, and you have the Yoshi town, and you have the cloud place called Nimbus Land, where the cloud people live, and Bowser's Castle, and all this other crazy stuff.
But you...
Play, um, but yeah, there are some original characters on there.
I mean, not just, you know, Mario and Toadstool and Bowser who came from the other games.
Um, but you have, um, Mallow who is a cloud boy who thinks he's a tadpole.
And Geno who is, uh...
Possessed by a creature from the Star Road And then, of course, Bowser and his little friends So that's the game Pretty cool It's got its own fun look and its own fun music And also, though, this is... I've mentioned this before, but it's one of the only three games That came outside of Japan that used the Nintendo SA-1
The others being Kirby Superstar and Kirby's Dream Land 3 So basically, and this was another microprocessor But it allowed a higher clock speed, faster RAM, greater memory mapping Data storage, compression, new DMA modes such as bitmap to bitplane And built-in CIC lockout, so pretty cool
Oh yeah, it had different sound effects that used the SBC-700.
That was pretty cool.
This game was really advanced for when it came out.
Alright.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
and Rock Band coming to the iPhone.
We talked a little bit about iPhone games.
Now a big, big title is coming its way to the iPhone.
So we'll be kind of talking about if folks are looking forward to that or if this just sounds like shit.
We'll talk about that all in a little bit when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
So stay tuned.
And welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio Live on this October 11th, 2009 Here for episode number 340 of our weekly podcast Which we've taped since June of 2002 During the break there, something I don't think we've done in quite some time in the history of our show Loki actually played a game live and provided us all of the break music tonight And we played some DJ Hero I am so sorry to the podcast listeners, but due to copyright restrictions
We can't play any more than we did in Part A for you guys, although I hear guys in our chatroom were bootlegging that, and we don't condone that, but if you know who to talk to, there's really nothing we can do about it if some of those bootlegs get out, so there you go.
But I posted a question in the chat, what you guys thought of that, and we were talking here in the studio, the soundtrack's really hot.
That third song, especially the Satisfaction vs. Boom Boom Pow, you know, I'm...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Just a part of the soundtrack.
You were actually rewinding.
You were doing the freestyle horns, right?
Freestyle, and then also there's parts where you can distort it, and I was using the effector dial on there to distort some of the tracks in there, too.
So there's a lot of stuff that you can kind of add on top of it, and actually there's a port in there where you can add a microphone, too.
I think a headset microphone if you want to talk over stuff, but that's tough enough.
But yeah, I did screw up a few spots where it dropped out.
It's really touchy.
It's sensitive to where...
I end the scratches too early sometimes, but it's fun, and we'll have to definitely do it again once we get the full game.
Now Bobby does want me to say in chat, obviously all games radio would prefer no bootlegs be released as we could be held liable.
Just saying, yeah, so obviously I was kidding before.
So don't release bootlegs because we don't want the fine folks to host our show here.
A lot of these songs I think are already out there in numerous gameplay clips.
I was commenting that I think that the Hollaback Boy, Girl, Wooden, whatever, that I have a very similar mashup on a disc that I bought in Berklee.
and honestly this is all just promotion for Activision anyway because honestly if I wasn't sold on this game already I am fucking buying this day one now so and I think a lot of folks in chat that were skeptical about the soundtrack have probably you know for the most part been overwhelmingly approved so
We've done a good thing for Activision here, but still, for legal reasons, yeah, we said what we said.
So, let's see, what else?
Yeah, DJ Dark Knight says, don't copy that floppy.
But back to the songs.
Let's see.
Cheeseburger does say, sorry, but I hate those songs, except for the synth in Satisfaction, which is a part of the original song anyway.
Well, they have a lot of stuff, like there's some hip-hop songs in there that I'm not going to be too excited to play, but...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
and reading some of your Twitter topics for tonight.
And there's a lot of DJ Hero talk on our Twitter feed right now, but we do have some questions.
Let's get to some quick Twitter topics tonight.
Ryan Belknap on Twitter at twitter.com slash OLR.
Uh-oh, I have the hiccups.
Worst thing in radio to have.
Excuse me, wants to know, what do you think about all of the games that were pushed back over the last month?
Will they be worth the wait?
There's a lot that I was waiting for to come out that have been pushed back, like Red Dead Redemption, which I'm very excited to play because it's Grand Theft Auto and the Wild West.
Then also, I'm trying to think what other stuff I was waiting for that are... I don't know, I'm kind of glad a lot of it's been pushed back because I don't have the money to buy all these right now.
I'll be picking up Borderlands probably in two weeks.
I'll be picking up DJ Hero hopefully earlier than that.
DJ Hero, Borderlands
DJ Hero is gonna be really cool and there's still some stuff coming out
and some of the games I bought already are really taking my time.
GamerGirl on Twitter wants to know, what's anyone's favorite video game soundtrack?
Favorite video game soundtrack?
Beatmania 2DX 5th Style is one of my favorite.
I can't really think about the dancing games, the music games, considering.
So I'm going to say that as far as a soundtrack that I can just sit and listen to over and over again, probably Klonoa.
hmm okay chrono or chrono trigger good choice i would i i'm gonna be just total uh stereotypical and go with the final fantasy series just because the final you know especially series like final fantasy 11 you know you do listen to that music so often when you play those games that it has to have good music so i would say a game like final fantasy 11 or probably my favorite soundtrack in the entire series was six final fantasy six
I'd have to go with six, although the spinoff soundtracks were pretty good.
Like Final Fantasy Prey and Celtic Moon, both fantastic.
Loki, any favorites for you?
I don't know.
I'd say maybe DDR5th or Max 2 would probably be my favorite soundtracks.
Katamari's pretty good.
Spazinator has two quick topics for us your video game related pet peeves mine would be arcades replacing arcade machines with redemption machines that's a pet peeve of mine I mean I understand why it's happening but it's still a pet peeve mine are programmed in quarter drainers for arcades for console it would be you know I really don't know probably bad voice acting
My other pet peeve would be Xbox Live Griefers.
Just the people on there and go, you know, NNNFFF, you know what I mean.
Fixing stuff that doesn't need to be fixed or just not adding features that should be completely simple to add.
For example, Grand Theft Auto 4.
The multiplayer, you can set your time limits for 5, 10, 15 minutes, 20 minutes, 30 minutes.
And then it jumps to 45 minutes.
If you want to play a 35 minute game, you have to play two games.
And it's annoying.
Like, because Saints Row, you can play anything from a 1 minute long game to a 60 minute game.
And it's just set at any amount of time in between.
And I don't understand why they have to take that out.
Or, when they updated for Lost and Damned, let's remove the helicopters out of free mode.
Yeah, that's an awesome idea.
Why the hell did you do that?
It's just...
There's no point.
We'll let Spazinator have a second question here on Twitter Topics tonight because he managed to fit two questions in 140 characters, so we'll let him do it.
What each console and their respective services can do to improve?
What could each console do to improve?
Anyone want to tackle this first?
What can each console do to improve?
Yeah, what could the Wii do?
What could the 360 do?
What could the PS3 do?
Well, the Wii, first of all, could have online play.
The Xbox 360 can, I don't know, they're pretty damn awesome.
I guess have better filters.
And the PS3 can be a different system.
Loki?
The Wii needs an actual online something other than just browsing a Flash, not even a Flash, like a JavaScript store for games and stuff.
They need something more substantial like the PlayStation Network and Xbox Live.
The PlayStation Network needs more download content on there as far as game releases and stuff like that because Xbox Live has at least one or two new games coming out each week.
XBOX Live
Point Conversion Crap
I definitely have the definitive answers in my opinion for these three consoles.
The Wii needs to embrace online, period.
Nintendo needs to stop being afraid of online and see how it can work for them in large doses.
But I honestly don't think the Wii can be remedied in its current state.
I think it is what it is.
I think it's been pigeonholed for what it is.
It's not necessarily a bad thing.
It is the number one console in America right now, whether we like it or not as hardcore gamers.
But I would say if they want to woo the hardcore gamers back, they're going to need to fix some things with Wii HD, which we all know is inevitable.
PlayStation 3 I couldn't disagree with DarkSakura more I think they did exactly what they needed to do this year and that was drop the price to a reasonable point and I think they're on a path for success right now I think the PS3's been doing a lot right this year PSP Go, completely different story PS3, I think is a console I would recommend to friends this Christmas, the biggest thing they could do now focus on working, selling those consoles and getting more exclusives would be the biggest thing they could do right now
Yeah, my PS3 is a Blu-ray player.
See, now I can't say that because especially now that my 360's been broken, I've been able to value the PlayStation more.
Now, tell me, when your Xbox 360 is fixed, is that going to change?
Are you going to immediately remember everything that you liked better about the Xbox 360?
It'll be about half and half because here's my thing for the 360.
And yes, there will be games that I will buy on the PlayStation 3 over the 360 because this 360 lacks hardcore in this one place.
And what the 360 needs to fix?
Anyone?
DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
Why else do you think that I like the Saturn Dual Analog Control, even though that one seemed kind of, you know, on the unwieldy side when you look at it?
It actually, everything, like, I was playing through just a number of games and having zero problem.
Like, well, Dan had problems with Mr. Driller, I didn't.
I mean, it may just be I've got, you know, smaller hands than both of you guys, but I don't really have much of a problem with playing games on the Xbox 360.
Um...
I actually hate a lot of the PS3 games just because, I mean, first of all, they'll rely on different visual effects that the Xbox 360 just doesn't need.
And also, in comparison, there's certain games that are coming out, namely Bayonetta, that is going to be complete and utter crap on PS3 as opposed to Xbox 360, both in terms of graphics, processor speed, how the game functions on the system.
Um, so, honestly, I think that the Xbox 360 controller to me is more comfortable in my hands.
That's why I got this on Xbox 360, as in Marvel Ultimate Alliance 2, instead of PlayStation 3, which I've played the first one on both systems, and to this day, the control is infinitely better on the Xbox 360.
Just playing Mega Man 9 on the 360 controller and playing it on a PS3 controller made me want to just build my own 360 controller.
I just cannot play some games on 360.
I'm not hating on Microsoft.
They do a lot right.
I mean, to be fair, if I'm picking on that, 360's done a lot of brilliant things this year.
1 vs. 100 was awesome.
They continue to lead the charge in online gaming.
But if I could fix something, that would be the first place to start is a new controller.
Well, third parties make other controllers, I think.
Doesn't Hori make one as well?
I don't think any of them really just radically change the design, though.
So.
Anyhow.
And, you know, you have a fan in Brad from PodCulture.
He says he prefers the 360 controller over the PS3 any day.
Yeah.
How about the noise of the system?
That would be the other thing I'd want to fix.
Is that when I am trying to watch Netflix or movies on the 360, it sounds like mom's running the vacuum cleaner behind me.
I don't notice.
Really?
Well, keep in mind how my setup is.
I have everything together under the drawer on there, so really...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Alright, one more question here.
Sertour from our Twitter wants to know, are PSP minigames too expensive?
Are the regular PSN download games too expensive in comparison to the UMD prices?
Yes and yes.
That's his opinion.
For me, I can't answer this and I doubt the others can too.
I haven't played a PSP minigame yet.
I haven't paid to download one.
I couldn't tell you if they're worth the money or not.
I don't know.
I keep forgetting they exist.
I do think people...
Forget what $5 or $10 is supposed to get you.
And honestly, I think $10 is not that much money for a video game.
And, you know, considering that most games now cost $60 used, I think most of these arcade games, I mean, this goes for Xbox Live and the minis and what have you, $10 for a game is not unreasonable, especially if the game's good.
Yeah.
I haven't played any PSP minigames, so I couldn't tell you.
As far as the regular PSN download games too expensive in comparison to UMD prices, you know what?
I'm all for the PSN download thing for convenience, but I'm also all for competition, and this is why I do not like the PSP Go, and I don't really care for where it's...
I don't like the fact that there's only one source to buy the games.
And it is something I haven't given a lot of thought to until the system was released.
But competition is usually a pretty healthy thing.
And if this digital distribution thing keeps going and online is the only place we're able to buy games, that is through Sony or through Microsoft in the future if they do something similar, that's going to be a little worrisome.
Because competition right now is what keeps things awesome.
What's a website like CheapAssGamer going to do if all the consoles go digital distribution?
There's always going to be older stuff that's out there.
And I don't think it's ever going to go away completely.
Because GameStop's not going to let it go away completely.
And despite every nice thing I said about PlayStation 3 earlier, I still think the PSP Go is a big joke.
And if you want to get a PSP, get a PSP 3000.
and I would recommend a PSP3000 but I would not recommend a PSPGO alright that's enough for Twitter topics we talked a lot about those Twitter topics let's move on with some rapid fire news tonight on Orange Lounge Radio Loki, start us off with some quick news
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
Almost like a plot to, say, The Wizard or something like that.
He's getting better at this one game in order to fight somebody.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
Thanks for watching!
DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
Some other individual songs coming out for the bands Black Tide, Joe Satriani, Kansas, L7, and Blink-182 with What's My Age Again.
That was one of the videos you would see on MTV all the time.
I bet L7's is Pretend That We're Dead.
That's already in the game.
And well then the other... And Andres is the song that's coming.
So there it is.
In other news, Jordan Mechner has filed a trademark for Prince of Persia, The Forgotten Sands.
Of course, Jordan Mechner is the creator of the Prince of Persia series after all.
So that may be something where... I don't know if that's something where the new Prince of Persia series is headed.
That also might tie in with the movie, too.
That is very true, is that it could be a sequel to the movie that's coming out next year.
I think Sands of Time is what it's based on, so it sounds like it could be a tie-in movie or...
and DarkSakura.com.
Xbox Live, PlayStation Network, and Steam will be seeing this game in 2010.
This is coming from Konami, has made this game.
It's going to be on Xbox Live Arcade and all that good stuff in early 2010.
It is not a remake.
It is a sequel 15 years after the last Rocket.
It looks pretty sweet, too.
Have you seen the screenshots or trailer yet?
I've just seen one screenshot, but I haven't seen the trailer.
DarkSakura
Well, for news of Halo 3 ODST, they actually made up... Sorry, I'm getting dinged.
My apologies.
Actually are getting...
Hit a 27 million games sold, which is pretty good.
I'm sorry, that's total Halo games sold is up to 27 million.
Actually, for ODST, 2.5 million copies have been sold within the last two weeks.
Also, there's to be a little bit more for it.
That means that we're going to be potentially seeing Master Chief come out in one of the future expansions.
and they also know that there were a few cliffhangers that need to be resolved but they're saying that they have a plan that's going out at least six years and it actually is going to tie in all the canon including comic books and novels that sounds ambitious
Also for Marvel Ultimate Alliance 2, they're getting Carnage.
And Carnage is, well, as everyone hopes, not just another Spider-Man and not just another Venom, but full-on, psycho, crazy, honorless, vicious... Did I say crazy?
Because I mean crazy.
Carnage is fucking nuts.
So yeah, be getting Carnage.
and then Activision filed a particular trademark for a particular adaptation of a particular game to be made into a movie and that would be Call of Duty so actually some of the people behind it were actually leaving hints about talking with different directors already cool
That would be it for my quickie stuff.
That would be interesting for a Call of Duty movie, but I suppose it's inevitable because the series is huge.
I think Call of Duty would make a great movie.
At least with Call of Duty there is an actual storyline that goes along with it.
It's not like, you know, okay, let's make a war movie and call it Call of Duty.
I still wouldn't see it.
I'm not a big fan of war movies.
I like chick flicks.
Call of Duty, the chick flick?
No, they don't need to do Call of Duty, the chick flick.
That would be pretty funny.
You know, Final Fantasy is kind of a chick flick in some ways.
Especially emo ones like Final Fantasy 7.
They turned Final Fantasy 7 into a movie that's kind of a chick flick.
A little bit.
They have.
Advent Children.
Advent Children wasn't so much a chick flick as it was just confusing.
It was non-stop action is what it was.
It doesn't need a plot.
It's just ass kickery.
Cloud is emo.
Vincent is dark.
Cloud is emo.
Vincent is dark.
Look.
Three Sephiroths.
Three Sufferbrats.
The end.
P.S.
Aerith is dead.
The end.
Tiger Claw says I like the Twilight movies.
Wrong.
Sparkly Vampires for the lose.
No, I'm not a fan of the Twilight movies.
I did tell you I sat down and tried to read the first book.
I'm glad it wasn't my book because it probably would have been the first book I ever burned.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Back to video games, sorry.
Just proving how crappy it is.
I hope this means that we do get a console version of Trackmania 2 because it looks absolutely awesome.
You know, all the stunt racing with kind of the Forza 3 graphics.
So, hey, that's not a bad combo whatsoever.
And they say, through Nadio, Ubisoft will gain an expert team, one of the best online technologies around, as well as a flagship multiplayer game that enjoys an unrivaled reputation among the loyal and committed community.
And, yeah.
So...
Awesome!
It doesn't look like they're going to be cancelling any Trackmania games and hopefully we'll see this come to consoles.
That's what I'm really hoping for because the DS version was awesome but not as good as a console release.
Alright, well moving on to Facebook and Twitter on the Xbox 360.
You know, this is something a lot of folks have been looking forward to.
Of course, Last.fm would be a part of this as well, but speaking specifically of Facebook and Twitter, there was a splash page spotted on Xbox Live's UK portal saying that the service is going to launch November 17th.
Now, of course, again, this was on the UK portal, but if I'm not mistaking, don't you get these updates worldwide?
So if they get it on the 17th, we would too?
Pretty much, yeah.
It'd be relatively close.
Yeah.
So that's what they're saying.
This was spotted in a screenshot on the Flash page if you zoom in a lot there.
And it is just assumed, even though Last.fm isn't featured on there, that this update is going to include that as well.
So there was a little firmware update that went out not that long ago kind of prepping the Xbox 360 for this.
So this is going to be on its way, and that's assumed in November.
I guess there's also going to be a beta test I was reading somewhere at the end of October.
Yeah.
for these services.
I'm kind of eh on these.
I think the one cool thing would be maybe taking screenshots and publishing them to Facebook.
That would be cool.
But I don't see this being something I would want to use.
What I really don't want to happen is I don't want it to turn into, with all due respect to the people that made it, Raptor.
I don't want my Xbox 360 tweeting every time I put in a new game because I know that's just going to irritate people.
Part of the reason I'm really starting to hate Twitter is that there's no filters.
Facebook is basically Twitter, but with filters.
But you can also use TweetDeck.
But even with TweetDeck, you can filter a certain person's tweets, which I do use, but you can't filter the type... If a person just posts annoying things over and over, I just unfollow them.
Exactly.
I'm sorry, but it's just Twitter.
If you're going to get butthurt over me unfollowing you, get something real to worry about, like...
you know, Darfur or something, I don't know but like, don't worry about me unfriending you on Twitter, it just means you post a lot of crap, so unfortunately Twitter not having filters makes it really inferior to Facebook and hopefully there'll be a magic button where I can just block all the 360 updates from Facebook if they're annoying, but if they aren't, then maybe I'll keep it around we'll see
Last.fm on the other hand sounds very cool because I'm already using Last.fm I have like 3,000 plays chalked up on there and god some people have way more than that and I think Last.fm has a really good recommendation service I prefer it to Pandora I know a lot of people disagree with me and think Pandora is god but I like that Last.fm kind of bases its recommendations off of what you already play I use Last.fm at work sometimes Pandora is really useless to me
DarkSakura.com
So, I think Last.fm is pretty cool.
I'm excited to see how it works on Xbox.
I hope I can use it for, like, background music.
We'll see.
But, anyhow, that is all coming soon for Xbox Live Gold.
Members getting a sneak peek, but it sounds like everybody will get to access it on November 17th in the UK.
I'm sure the rest of us, hopefully, around the same time.
SSJ100Matt says in our chatroom, chat.orangehauntsradio.com, I really hope this doesn't open my gamer tag to the cam whores and porn spammers.
Oh, I hope so, too.
but seeing as you have to follow them in order to see the messages on Twitter, hopefully you know
and SalaciousPop in chat.
I like this comment.
LOL, it's not like LiveJournal where it's a grievous offense to defriend someone.
Totally agree because I totally get butt hurt when people defriend me on LiveJournal.
It's like, what did I do?
I'm doing it right now, Rob!
No!
I'll cry.
No, I do get butt hurt when people unfriend me on LiveJournal, but I put a lot more of myself out there on LiveJournal.
Twitter, I agree, is bullshit.
Facebook...
I always kind of wonder why someone would defend me on Facebook because it's just Facebook.
But LiveJournal, I actually kind of get butt hurt because I have a friends-only journal.
And so if I let someone in to read it all and then they just leave, I'm kind of sad.
So I like to know why or, you know, I'm a big boy.
Tell me if you're unfollowing me.
You post too many memes or you post too many advertisements for your LiveJournal games.
Please tell me.
Rob, I am so tired of that Survivor thing.
Which, by the way, I'm hosting season 18, and we're looking for players.
I think it's silly that there are 18 seasons.
Well, there's 20 of the real things, so believe it.
Alright, anyhow.
I'm sad that it caught up that fast.
It's no worse than roleplay gaming online.
That's what it is.
It's roleplay gaming.
Alright, anyway.
Ray Iannami in chat asked, what the hell is Farmville or Mafia Wars?
Obviously he has a thought.
I will say this though, Bejeweled Blitz got a makeover this week and it's awesome.
It's awesome.
They totally revamped the game and made it more awesomer.
Well, Facebook finally did something right, speaking of their little games, that if I don't give a shit about what game you're playing, and by the way, Loki, your wife just posted weird pictures of herself.
Wait a minute, did she?
Yes, she did.
Yes, yes.
I was trying to post my live journal post of my finishing the cabinet, and she was sitting next to me because I had my camera there that I had just taken pictures with.
Taking weird pictures of herself and standing there going, Hey, look at this.
Hey, look at this.
Hey, look at this.
Then she started taking pictures of me, too, and it was annoying.
I'm like, knock it off.
Okay, what's more annoying, wife taking pictures of you or Farmville?
Farmville.
Farmville.
But actually someone pointed out to me that you can hide those little app announcements when people announce the shit.
You didn't know that?
Well, I didn't think about it.
But the ones that were getting me is when you have like up in your little top hand corner the so-and-so sent you a big pile of poopy from sorority life.
Yes.
and I found and the thing is is that I've gone into my settings and blocked the application and blah blah blah blah blah I have a real life you know and it still gives me those little invite things whenever people send me the shit I don't care about so I found that you can go into the little thing there and then block the app from there I actually do think I did send you a big pile of poop in sorority life the other day so I'm surprised you're not using that to speaking of which
DarkSakura
You have to.
That's what we do here on the show.
Apparently, Sony and Microsoft don't understand MMOs on a console.
Um...
Thanks for watching!
You know, like Champions Online, it runs almost, you know, pretty much all of their MMOs run on the console.
It's just that they're trying to get Sony and Microsoft to understand how an MMO works and what helps it make its money.
They said that the only one that's come close is maybe Final Fantasy...
I just, I'm like...
If you are a newbie to the world of MMOs, why don't you let the people who have done them before help you with your business model?
Hey, it's worked for this.
Why don't you do it this way?
To me, I don't really see any reason why it can't be run like it is on the PC.
You buy your game.
You pay your subscription fee.
What's the big deal?
Well, you know, there have been some MMOs on consoles, but all the good ones I can think of were also on PC, like Final Fantasy XI, which might be the only console MMO.
Well, for its time, yes.
Although Final Fantasy XIV, I'm all about that.
I just still remember the day that you came over here to help me set up some of my stuff on Final Fantasy XI.
Mm-hmm.
and I was doing everything on a controller down to all my macros and everything.
Yeah, yeah.
And you looked at me going, how the fuck are you doing that?
I couldn't play that game with a controller.
I realized it was made for the PS2, but I could not play that game with a controller.
Well, no.
No, no.
I was playing on the PC.
I know, I know you were.
With a controller, yeah.
I know you were.
Because I've been playing PSO.
And I thought you were a crackhead.
Hey, I made that shit work.
I was like, shut up, please!
But it really wasn't until I got to World of Warcraft that I had to actually learn how to play with a keyboard, which sucks.
I think MMOs are certainly possible on consoles, like a console-exclusive MMO, and I kind of wish they'd go for it.
I think a game like Demon's Soul shows it's possible, even though that's not really an MMO.
It is still a massively kind of multiplayer environment.
It's just that the game doesn't revolve around the multiplayer environment.
Well, I still, by the way, I'm going to say to this day that I still wish that World of Warcraft had controller support and that I'm looking for two months of play, please.
Beg, beg, grovel, grovel.
Not really.
When my paycheck situation fixes up.
I dinged level 45 Paladin today.
Yay!
You know what level my character got to?
Seven.
Yes, exactly.
You mentioned it two weeks ago.
I know.
And I haven't played in that long.
All right.
Anyhow, Loki...
I haven't played any You've never played World of Warcraft, huh?
You sunk like three years Well, you suck for one, but you sunk like three years of your life into Final Fantasy XI and somehow never got sucked into World of Warcraft It's amazing to me This is what happens when Rob has a third a glass of wine Apparently Final Fantasy XIV, though It won't be okay to drive home Final Fantasy XIV, though I don't know Final Fantasy XIV looks so sexy
No!
You can't do this now!
I have a life.
I've already moved on.
If anything's going to cause a divorce, it's going to be Final Fantasy XIV.
Anyhow.
You better hope it has Bejeweled in it.
For your wife.
I showed her the Bejeweled Square Enix game.
You remember that?
Oh, yeah.
But it's Bejeweled Twist.
She doesn't like Bejeweled Twist.
She's like, I know.
or whatever.
So, Fifth Cell, they're looking to move on to some other platforms other than the Wii and DS.
Their next game, which is pretty big, they say, and unannounced, will be for Xbox Live Arcade.
And they go on saying that we're doing an Xbox Live Arcade title next.
It's going to be pretty big.
Well, that's...
I'm going to take a wild guess and say that it's probably going to look very similar to Drawn Life and Scribblenauts since both their games are very similar looking.
Just my guess.
I'm glad they're not doing the cheap Scribblenauts 2.
In fact, I hope they never make a sequel to Scribblenauts.
I would like to see more games that they just don't make sequels to.
I know that sounds cruel, but sometimes these series get dug into the ground.
Like the Guardian Legend.
No!
That must have a sequel.
That's one of those games where it's like, okay, 25 years later, we need a sequel to that.
Or at least a remake.
I mean, come on.
A reimagining.
How about a reimagining?
I don't like the word remake as much as I do reimagining because usually the reimagined games are better.
Like the Silent Hill game on the Wii, which that's out very soon, right?
On November.
Damn, they're going to miss Halloween?
Yeah, I got delayed.
Stupids.
Also stupid, in my opinion.
Rock Band is on its way to the iPhone, and I don't get it.
Like, I do and I don't.
It's like the PSP version.
No.
Bite your tongue.
The PSP version is amplitude or frequency.
It is awesome.
The iPhone version is just tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
My opinion, I should give you some of the facts.
There is going to be a four-way multiplayer mode.
It's all done over Bluetooth.
And then you're going to have 20 games, which apparently are all in the actual game.
And of course, since the iPhone will allow you to do microtransactions now, you can bet there's going to be downloadable songs in the future that you will be able to buy these song packs from EA Mobile.
So basically, this is just Rock Band on your phone.
You can play drums with your fingers.
And in my opinion, it's a little ridiculous.
You know what?
I probably won't ever get it because I'm still playing Peggle.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
or Wikipanion or something.
I'm never on the games.
Hardly ever.
Here's what I have on mine just for games left on here right now.
It's Peggle, Cooking Mama, Vi, which was the Sega CD RPG.
I have the IMT Pain app.
Let me tell you what I have.
Hang on, we're today.
That's fun.
I have quite a few.
DDRS, Tap Tap Revenge 2, Word Fu, Labyrinth, Wild West, Silent Hill The Escape, Aurora Faint The Arena, Pinball Dreams, Peggle, Columns Deluxe, Infinity Gene Space Invaders, Civilization Revolution,
and Luminous Light, which if you listen to the mini show from last week is the most horrible adaptation of Luminous.
It's an aberration of a Luminous game.
I've also had a Light Cycle game.
Remember, I had my Light Cycle game for a while.
And I did get Katamari, which I just didn't think was as much fun as I'd hoped it would have been on the iPhone.
And I had Pole Position Remix, which was pretty fun.
Pole Position.
Mostly what I've been playing on here.
I tried Pac-Man when I didn't think it was fun.
I just think the touch controls kind of suck.
Like I'm just kind of done with it.
Except for Peggle.
Yeah, they make it work for Peggle.
I will give you that.
It's actually a lot of fun to play Peggle on the iPhone.
That would be like the first game I would recommend.
Oh yeah, I have my Solitaire game.
I had a good Sudoku game too.
Well anyhow, Rock Band's coming to the iPhone and I don't care.
But maybe you do.
I'm sure there will be plenty of folks that download this.
They're not going to have a problem selling this.
There you go.
Anyhow, let's get into the part of the show that is all about you guys and the emails that you send us every week to Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com It's our Orange Lounge Radio Mailbag segment.
I know, I'm excited too.
DarkSakura is going to jump in head first in the email bag and pull out some emails to read.
I doubt it's very full this week as we didn't have a show last week really.
Well, we had a pre-taped show.
We had a number.
A tiny show.
Anyway, this comes from Slapshot, I'm gonna guess.
Hey guys, I know you probably won't read this on this show because of the content, but I have a question about trying out, quote, Sims 3.
Everything has installed fine, and I'm using Magic Disk for my ISO.
I see.
Yeah, I'm gonna go ahead and do it online, I don't care.
After Sims 3 loads up, it gives me the error saying I don't have a disk in my drive.
Any suggestions?
Thanks a lot.
Um...
I have a suggestion.
Buy the game.
That'll fix it.
Having a physical disc would probably be advisable.
I don't mean to give you shit, but when you decide to pirate games, getting low quality and crap like this happening to you is exactly what you sign up for.
So, like, if this were fmylife.com, I'd be clicking you deserved it right now.
so sorry I don't have any real advice for you but you know what there comes a point where we have to say enough piracy is enough and dude just buy the game I'm sorry I was actually suddenly looking at the back of my box yeah cause my Sims 3 box is like sitting here on my desk because I keep the game in my damn drive and take it out to burn DVDs so who else has seen the back of your box?
Look!
Ooh!
Rob, it's my box.
It's green.
And look, my box has a car.
I need to see a doctor.
Next email, quick.
Give me a doctor!
Okay.
This is from our buddy Robb.
Although this is not podcast material, I just wanted to share about my first trip to Disneyland.
Oh, it's podcast material.
I can see why you guys love it so much.
The Nightmare Before Christmas Haunted Mansion was amazing and worth the trip alone.
I also noticed that your Pirates of the Caribbean ride has the same basic components, but it is just plain better.
Well, that's because we have two drops on ours.
You know the one over in Florida has one drop.
Sorry, we just had a feed drop in our state, so I was talking to the chatters.
What is this about?
I'm sorry.
It's Disneyland.
Oh, yay!
That's right, he went.
He went the one week I didn't go.
Because I went, and then I stayed here a week, and then I went again.
And he was there the week I was home.
Well, going forward, I love California Adventure too, so I looked it up on Google Maps and saw something cool in the lagoon, which still had water in the picture.
There appears to be an earthquake happening based on the interference pattern on the surface.
A normal lagoon of that size would normally have small irregular waves, not evenly spaced and consistent wave patterns, except that the lagoon water is filtered and runs through cyclically.
So, well, it did when they had one.
So, because I've actually got to peek in the lagoon now that it's dumped out and they're redoing shit.
So, but yeah, actually I love looking at, just look at Disneyland over on Google Maps.
That's pretty cool.
It's kind of fun to go on a virtual tour of Disneyland.
I love Google Maps just to go on virtual tours of just about anything.
But I'm really glad to hear Robaba had fun at Disneyland because it is a fun place.
I'm hoping to go one more time before my season pass expires.
I keep forgetting if we said it was Shook.
I think you said Shook.
I think it is Shook.
Okay.
Hello, OLR.
First off, I'd like to say that my fight with my father is over.
Yay!
Wait, I thought it was resolved in a previous episode of OLR.
Well, his dad took the game away, remember?
Yeah, but I thought they made up.
I talked to him, quoting you guys.
I hope you didn't quote the kind of rude stuff that we said, because...
Anyway, but he seemed understanding for once.
He tried playing Final Fantasy X, and he actually seemed to love it, most notably the metal music.
Now, on to the main story.
I was in gym class playing American football when an idiot in my class fouls the ball.
He runs over to the ball and starts teabagging the ball.
Let that sink in.
I swear to God, we read this email the week you weren't here.
Did you?
But I'm looking at the date that email was received, and it was Friday.
I wonder if dudes have emailed twice.
Oh, well, if you already read it, then... Go ahead and finish.
Is it about the lewd sexual behavior?
Yeah, you weren't here.
Go ahead.
You can put your opinion on it.
I don't know if you already read it, then.
I could be wrong.
Chatters, does this email sound familiar?
Like, that's why I said I could swear we had a resolution on the, um...
The Coach grabs him by the neck, drags him inside, screaming, you little son of a bitch.
The idiot was suspended for lewd sexual behavior.
It just goes to show how far gaming has taken us in society.
It truly is the shit like this that gives us good gamers a bad stereotyped name.
What really pisses me the hell off slash rant.
P.S.
A few weeks ago, Juan ranted about old people not wearing bras.
He was right.
My old bag of an English teacher let out a knit slip in front of everyone.
Gag.
Ew.
You've got a fucked up school, dude.
Your English teachers are showing their ta-tas and your gym teachers are throwing people against the wall calling them sons of bitches.
Like, seriously?
Go to private school?
Well, first of all, the behavior was... Tell your dad we said that, too.
The behavior of the idiot playing football was indeed unnecessary and deserved punishment, but... Has nothing to do with games.
Yeah, that has nothing to do with games.
The coach, however, seriously needed to also be suspended at least for a game or have some sort of probationary measure taken.
And then your English teacher does need to wear a better bra.
This sounds like the high school in Glee.
Like, only random shit happens.
You've got an interesting life.
None of that ever happened at mine except for one teacher accidentally ripping his pants in.
I always saw his underwear, but still.
Shook, I hope you're writing all this down so that you can write an epic autobiography someday.
A memoir, if you will.
Dude, sell it to a reality show or something.
Of course, you know I won't watch it.
You're so kind.
I don't watch a reality show.
Sorry, you know.
Okay, this next one comes from SonicM88.
Hello, OLR!
Hi.
I was just responding.
I miss you guys a ton.
Wow, a ton.
That's 2,000 pounds.
I haven't been able to listen to you guys forever for several months for complicated reasons, but I needed to let you guys know something.
Rob, I remember way back in an old podcast you used to talk about how much you loved Alanis Morissette and Rock Band 2.
Well, as I'm sure you know, two additional Alanis Morissette songs came as downloadable content.
What?
Really?
Yeah.
I was probably just as stoked as you were to hear that they were coming out.
You lie!
So I bought them as soon as I could and for you I decided to get first place on both of them, Ironic and Head Over Feet on vocals.
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
Hold on.
Loki, Alanis tracks came out on Rock Band?
I missed this.
There may have been some.
You know we didn't cover Rock Band releases last week because we didn't have a show.
Maybe it did happen.
Chatters?
Did I really miss that?
Can I continue?
Figure it's the one week that you don't do it.
I know, right?
As of this posting, I'm still first on Xbox 360 leaderboards.
Gamertag LucasPones8907.
Orange Children Radio rocks.
He sends a follow-up email, though.
It seems someone's taking my first place on head over feet, but I'm working hard for first again for you, Rob.
I'm still first on ironic, though, but maybe I shouldn't say that or I'll jinx my score again.
Dude, I'll play expert with you or something.
We'll take over the leaderboards.
I did not know that.
Now I gotta get my Xbox 360 back.
There you go.
You asked earlier what it would take to get my 360 back.
What's gonna light the fire under Rob's ass?
Alanis and Rock Band.
Hey, you know what lit the fire under your ass for, uh...
for PS3.
Abba.
Oh, yeah, SingStar Abba.
Yeah, that was a big, big seller, too.
Which I still play.
You need to play some Beatles Rock Band with me.
You can dance.
Anyway.
I did pretty damn good, okay?
I blame you now for me playing Beatles Rock Band.
For getting me up there and making me sing.
There is much more to the cast of Orange Lounge Radio than just video games.
And I will say, and I am not ashamed to admit, I'm a huge Alanis Morissette fan.
And that was my...
Like musical muse in high school, like for real.
Did you, did you actually, did you watch the video that I posted on Facebook a while back, which was the metaphor-free radio thing from College Humor?
Was that the... The guy sitting in the car?
No, I didn't see that one.
I saw the Total Eclipse of the Heart little video.
It was basically a guy listening to his radio and says, and now on Sublight Radio we have metaphor-free radio and then it was all these songs doing literally what the songs mean.
And the Alanis part was, I hate you, Dave Coulier!
Shut the front door.
TigerClaw just linked me to Rockband.com.
Sure enough, this happened on October 2nd.
This would have been the week we weren't here.
This was last week.
That's just what goes to show if we miss a session.
Electric Six and Flowbots.
Oh my god, Gay Bar by Electric Six is in Rockband.
That song is awesome.
Sweet!
You, I want to take you to a gay bar.
That song is rad.
Dude, we missed an awesome week.
Do you have that on your computer, Rob?
I do, but iTunes will slow things down significantly.
However, this is why we have such wonderful things like YouTube, so that when you're in the middle of a radio show, you can actually just pull it up and you can actually get the song.
I wanna take you to a game bar I wanna take you to a game bar I wanna take you to a game bar Game bar, game bar Let's stop Stop Why is war censored on YouTube?
Is that because it's Abraham Lincoln wearing no pants and you can't say war?
On a spin bike at that
Tell me you do not want to play this in Rock Band right the fuck now.
Seriously.
That looks like Abraham Lincoln.
That'd be awesome.
Wearing spandex.
Seriously, after the show, YouTube that immediately.
It's hilarity.
It really is.
That song is awesome.
Anyhow, thank you, emailer, for alerting us to such awesomeness in rock band that we missed the week of... Ranma is throwing up the horns, but he's doing it wrong.
Ironically enough, the week of gay days at Disneyland.
Ranma is throwing up the horns the wrong way because really that's too much metal for one hand.
Too much metal at the gay bar.
All right.
Anyhow, let's move on to the FUs of the week, which I sadly don't really have a story to inspire tonight.
So we're just going to get into the FUs of the week.
I thought there was something in our show role about a lawsuit, but I guess maybe it was something I cut out accidentally.
Whatever.
It's one of those nights tonight.
I've been drinking wine, and now I have gay bar on repeat in my head.
Now Loki's singing it over there.
I just said one line.
Alright, anyhow.
Here come the FUs of the week.
A chance for a little angst in your life.
FU to EDD and other disability things for the lovely gap in my paycheck.
which has not been fun because I like to have money with which to pay my bills.
I really like being able to pay my bills because it means that I can eat and have a place to live without feeling completely guilty for taking advantage of my friend's generosity.
And there's also this wonderful concept, Rob, of power and internet.
I love them.
Love them both.
I would seriously go without eating before I didn't pay the internet bill.
Honestly, I realize my priorities are fucked, but... I'll put it this way.
I found food in my fridge that I didn't even know existed.
And then once we got a little bit of a break, thanks to...
Thanks to me getting some massage work in.
Thanks to having a very good, generous friend.
And thanks to a little bit of a break on our rent.
So we actually were able to go get groceries and get some of our bills paid.
I might take you out for a massage, by the way.
I could use one.
If you're still giving them out.
50 bucks?
I might actually go for it.
For an hour?
For an hour.
I might do it.
I might have friends that are interested, too, if you really want.
As long as they won't report me for not having my business license.
Oh.
Well, I don't know about that, but I can't get a PA there.
Rob, Rob.
What?
I cannot charge for that.
Wink.
Wink.
Okay, I get it.
Well, do I get a happy ending?
Just kidding.
I don't want that.
Gross.
I'll find you a kilted Scotsman for it.
Loki, your F.U.
to the week.
F.U.
to the guy.
It's actually kind of my fault.
F.U.
to me, answering the door to my house, because every time I do, it's always somebody that's trying to sell me something, and for some reason I end up getting roped into buying something.
Well, in this case, it was actually a guy coming up to quote us for a new roof, which is fine, because we needed that, and I wanted to quote for a new roof.
But he sat there and talked to us for two hours and that was just unacceptable.
I just wanted him to give me a damn price because I knew it was going to be expensive anyways.
But he sat there and talked about how his roofing system is the most awesome thing in the world and I really don't give a crap because I was in the middle of soldering for my new cabinet.
And you don't interrupt that.
F you to something I didn't bring up earlier in the show but F you to the fact that my World of Warcraft account got hacked this week while I was on vacation I got a call Monday morning from my buddy Shane who said that all my characters were logging in and out of Ravencrest and I said boy that's really funny because I'm not playing the game right now
In fact, I'm in Los Angeles.
Turns out my password was stolen and my account was hacked.
Which makes me feel very vulnerable.
Because if they have my WoW password, what else do they have?
Now granted, I removed an authenticator from my account, which yes, you might think is stupid, but the keychain broke.
So I was going to lose that authenticator if I didn't remove it from my account.
So they could have stolen my password from my ex-boyfriend's computer, maybe his was insecure, I don't know.
But all I know is that it makes me very nervous to know that I have passwords stolen.
So I had to go change all of my passwords and everything.
To Blizzard's credit, very nice customer service, even though it took me forever to get through.
Like, they had a 30-minute hold time Monday morning, and I even called, like, right before close, and I still had to wait 18 minutes before I got a representative.
But to be fair, she was very nice, did everything she was supposed to do.
I train customer service for call centers, so I'm always very scrutinizing those people.
She was a very good rep, and I got an email from a lady that was very nice at Blizzard, too.
The GMs fixed my stuff.
Probably the whole thing took about three to four days.
But fuck you to people who steal passwords.
And I've decided I'm completely against people buying gold in WoW at this point.
You know why?
Because you only encourage these assholes to do what they do.
So if you buy gold in WoW, fuck you.
There you go.
Xlink in chat says, wow, rape?
Damn, yes, I feel like I was raped in the face by a Warcraft hacker.
Loomies in chat says, Rob, I had to wait an hour and a half on Friday morning.
I should get everything restored in two to four days.
Well, sadly, I guess it wasn't, I mean, I'm glad to hear it wasn't just me, but at the same time, that really sucks.
Yeah, it takes a couple days to get everything restored.
See, now the good news was...
Thanks for watching!
The story I was going to read to lead into the FUs tonight for some reason I forgot to link it.
There was a dude that got banned from the Sony PlayStation Network and he was going to file a lawsuit or he did file a lawsuit saying that his First Amendment rights were breached.
Well, and what's wrong with this picture?
Can your First Amendment rights really be breached when you're banned from the PlayStation Network?
No, because PlayStation Network is a private network.
And that's exactly what Judge Ronald M. White said in a federal court in the Northern District of California earlier this week, is that there was no plausible First Amendment cause and threw out the lawsuit.
But interesting from some of the commenters here on Kotaku where I saw this story, I thought a really good point that was brought up by one of the commenters is that when you buy stuff on PlayStation Network, it's tied to your login name.
So if you suddenly get banned from WoW, not only do you lose your access, you lose everything you bought.
That is kind of messed up, in a way.
Although, granted, if you did something really bad, maybe you had it coming.
It's also in the Terms of Service, and you have to read that.
But that's shady.
That's a little shady.
Throw all this money at us to buy online stuff and then get banned?
It's an incentive for him not to be a douchebag.
Now, what is kind of messed up, and yeah, you may not realize it, like, for example, the PlayStation Network forums, where it's tied to your account,
You get banned from the forums, you get banned from PlayStation Network, which is kind of shady because you may not realize that.
But once again, read your terms of service.
Wow.
And don't be a douchebag.
Yeah, I mean, I agree with don't be a douchebag, and maybe he had it coming in a way.
But at the same time, what if a mistake happens?
Because I'm comparing apples to oranges here, but on the Xbox side of things, if you get banned, there's no way to contest it, which I think is kind of fucked up.
I think there should be a way you can contest it.
S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
I heard it might have been an exploit in Flash that got me, but still, terrible.
Terrible, terrible.
Alright, just a couple more stories for you guys, and then your calls, Loki.
Yes, so EA has trademarked a new game called The Ripper, and what it's believed to be is actually a game based on Jack the Ripper, and apparently...
Jack the Ripper
This is similar to a movie where you're killing demons with its people and stuff like that.
So yeah, think of like I guess a Dead Space game where you're Jack the Ripper ripping people apart, but they're really demons so you shouldn't feel so bad about it.
Praise Jack the Ripper.
Interesting, I guess.
And it's believed that this is Visceral Games' new action title.
All right.
S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
All right.
Anyhow, one more story for you guys.
Then we're going to open up the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
I'm hoping to hear from some new people tonight because I know we have some new people listening.
So 1-877-GAME-OLR, username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
We have one more story for you guys involving one of my favorite games.
In fact, probably my favorite game ever on the Commodore 64, at least I can think of right now.
Archon.
Remember Archon?
It was like Battle Chess but cooler because it wasn't actually chess but it was dark versus light and you were trying to take over these power squares but when two pieces would come together like the Shapeshifter and the Phoenix or the Banshee and the Valkyrie they would do battle in this arena and you would basically have to kill one other piece.
So it wasn't like chess where whoever was the attacker was always the victor.
Two pieces would fight.
Well the game came on the iPhone not that long ago.
There was a version of it released for iPhone which I forgot about.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
In bringing Archon back to the PC, we've really focused on maintaining the classic feel of the original game.
That said, there were aspects of the title that needed updating for the modern audience.
For example, the addition of four players was never in the original, but it adds so much fun it feels like it always belonged there.
So yes, there are achievements and HD resolution, online support, it's all going to be there.
And apparently there's going to be a new Archon-based iPhone game as well.
It's going to be...
A single player experience with four campaigns, 60 quests, unique enemies, and characters.
It's all going to use NG Moco's Plus technology.
Awards and a leaderboard and all that fun stuff.
Archon Conquest, submitted to the App Store earlier this month, should be out anytime now.
Battle Chess
Yeah, I never played the game.
1-877-GAME-OLR or username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
It's that time of the show where we're going to take your calls.
So give us a call and comment on anything you've heard about tonight or any topic we haven't discussed that you'd like us to get into.
Before we get into that and before the calls start rolling in since there is a little delay before the calls hit our line when you guys hear it, Loki, any last minute stories?
Um... Yeah, the Oddworld games are coming to the PlayStation Network.
And apparently titles that were exclusive before are also now coming to the PC.
They have a new pack that they're basically releasing them under.
I guess the, um... What was it?
The, uh... Original... The Oddbox.
That's what it was.
Including, um... Looks like, uh... Stranger's Wrath, um...
Munch's Odyssey and the original Oddworld game.
So that's kind of cool.
That's it.
Let me get to the phones.
We have a call.
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
Hello, you're... Oh my gosh, Skype crashed on me.
That sucks.
That was not the caller's fault.
That was Skype's fault.
It just crashed.
Bad Skype.
Bad Skype.
Naughty, naughty.
And I apologize to the caller that was on the line waiting to talk to us.
But computer crashes, I guess, are inevitable.
Thank God Adobe Audition didn't crash or we'd lose all Part B of our show.
Wouldn't that be lovely?
Do over.
I'm going to call that person back because they did get through.
This is a nice thing.
When you call through Skype, I know who it is.
Hi, you're on Orange Noms Radio.
Who's this?
Hey, this is X-Link.
Hi, X-Link.
I don't know if you heard if the buffer made it through.
For some reason, Skype crashed, so we called you back.
No, thank you.
I appreciate it.
No, I was on there, and I saw that.
I was like, wow, that's kind of interesting.
I thought it was my end because I'm having problems with my laptop right now with my mouse pad part.
Instead of clicking once, I click like five different times.
Nah, Skype just sucks.
Although I am thinking about using it on my PSP.
I have a PSP headset and I can use Skype on it, but I'm like, who would call me?
Like, nobody calls my iPhone.
Why would people call me on Skype?
I don't know.
Anyway, sorry.
That would be kind of interesting.
A few things.
I'm going to make this quick, of course.
I'm going to go through a few things here really quickly.
The PSP Mini prices are actually pretty decent.
The only one that's really the highest point as of right now would be the Tetris game.
Um,
E.A.
is going to be a little more expensive because of the E.A.
brand name being on it.
Oh, hell, of course.
As for the Kingdom Hearts, I played a new one.
I've been playing a new one for DS.
I'm not going to give anything away storyline-wise, but I'm going to say I know you're a big fan of it.
Play it when you get a chance or buy it.
It's worthwhile.
It's been a lot of fun.
I've been playing it about 10 hours, and I've been pretty much addicted to it.
And there is a lot of Disney characters in it.
Okay, as long as they didn't cut out the Disney, then I'm happy.
How about Tron?
You can spoil that for me.
Is Tron in it?
I don't know.
To be quite honest, I only played 10 hours.
I'm only on the second, third world.
I was going to say, was 10 hours enough to get past the prologue like Kingdom Hearts 2?
Oh, definitely.
You know, there's a lot of talk in the beginning, and there's a lot of the beginning where they're saying, okay, this button does this, this does this.
If you press this button, it does this.
This is how you do stuff in the game.
But once you get past all of it, it pretty much becomes normal.
Hmm.
All right, well, I'll have to check that out, I suppose.
Does it play like the PlayStation Kingdom Hearts games, or is it that crappy card at all?
It plays like the PS, yes.
The PS1, the Kingdom Hearts, and Kingdom Hearts 2, it does play like that.
Good.
It's not like the Chain of Memory.
Thank God.
Good.
So I'm waiting for Birth By Sleep for the PSP now, so hopefully that will work as well, too.
So we'll see on that one.
Very cool.
I'll tell you if you want a headache, try playing Chain of Memories on a micro.
No, thank you.
No, thank you.
I'll pass on that one.
I do have the original, though, for the Game Boy Advance.
That was the last one I tried to play on any handheld.
I can only imagine what a headache machine that was.
Anything else on your mind tonight, X-Link?
Well, it was kind of funny you brought up the whole hacking issue.
Wasn't there having a problem with the Xbox Live and the hacking on that one too?
Some people were trying to get people's accounts to that one that had high game scores.
Yeah, it was retarded stuff.
It was like some kid sending voice messages to people saying, I can give you cheats or whatever if you send me your account information.
You'd have to be an idiot to fall for that.
Yeah, I've never had a problem on Xbox Live, at least that I know of yet.
I mean, I've been out of Xbox Live for about two months now, so.
I've been on longer than that, so I've been busy doing my school stuff, so.
Yeah, I understand that, but they're trying to probably, it would sound like someone they were pulling back in the, you know, hey days of, hey, give me, I'm so and so, I'm surprised or not, I'm so and so from Xbox Live, I need your name and password, there's been a system server crash, that type of deal.
Well, I hope everyone knows by now, nobody will ask you for your name and password online.
Nobody.
It just doesn't happen.
Not through email, not online.
It doesn't happen.
Even when you call support, they don't ask for it.
They have ways of verifying you in other ways.
Like I know with Blizzard, I guess I filled out a security question about like, for example, this wasn't my security question, but like an example would be, what was your house number as a child?
You know, things that only you would know that a hacker wouldn't know.
Well, anything else on your mind tonight, X-Link?
No, that's pretty much about it.
I'm playing with Demon's Soul.
I heard that's one of the hardest ones yet from Atlus, and I'm hearing they're getting good reviews from it, so have a lot of fun with that.
Although I can see from a critical standpoint where it's getting good reviews and I'm not knocking the game at all, but the difficulty is really going to turn some people off, so proceed carefully.
Oh, I agree, but hey, Atlas RPGs, you can't really beat that.
I mean, pretty much everything they have sealed with their name on there has been pretty much gold.
Alright, fair enough.
They do make good stuff.
Alright, take care, X-Link.
Yeah, you too.
Thanks for the call.
We got comments in chat here.
What is this?
KillGannon1337 says, I wonder if Rob's WoW pass was secure, like caps, numbers, and shit.
I didn't use caps, but my password...
to somebody who wouldn't know better would look like a random jumble of letters they meant something to me but for most people just look like a random jumble of letters and numbers I did use both letters and numbers so I don't think by any means it was easy to guess like it wasn't like a pet name it wasn't you know anything like that so let's go to another call hi you're on Orange Launch Radio who's this hello you're on Orange Launch Radio who's this
Hola, bienvenidos a Orange Lounge Radio.
Quien es?
Okay, I guess the person isn't there.
Remember, you can always call Echo 123 before you give us a call to make sure your setup works.
That's always a good idea.
So, there you go.
1-877-GAME-OLR or username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
Hi, this is Spazinator.
Oh, pretty good.
How are you?
Two quick hits.
I don't want to take up too much time because you're near the end of your show.
Um, I got, you know, one tip of information, uh, regarding, you know, the PSN store, uh, released from, uh, I think it was last week.
Yeah.
And, you know, also, at the same time, I also want to put some on about, uh, the PlayStation 3 as well.
Um, there was one, uh, release, uh, on the PSN store.
It's a PS1 classic that I think you guys may have liked.
It was Pandemonium, which was put up by, I think, Crystal Dynamics.
Yes, I've never played the game, but I've heard of it.
I actually have the Japanese version of it, which was Magical Hoppers.
Oh, yeah.
I used to have the disc version.
Unfortunately, I had that stolen a couple years ago, so I just bought the download version now.
It's pretty good.
The graphics are kind of dated by today's standards, but all in all, it's pretty good.
As far as my complaint, it isn't so much with the system itself, it's just some of the mass stupidity of some of the other users on it.
You know how with the messaging on there, they get the whole cut and paste kind of deal on there?
Well, I don't know if you've seen this yet or not.
If not, you probably will see it soon.
But, you know, people have been doing the unpaced chain messages.
Oh, no.
Oh, yeah.
It's like, you know, if you send this message to X number of people, Sony's going to see this, and they're going to track this message, and
You know, if they'll release Halo on the PlayStation 3.
Oh my god.
Ridiculous.
Yeah, I'm like, yeah, really.
That's why I'm thinking A.
Hilo, Gears, and all their Microsoft exclusives
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
No, they don't.
They only put this stuff in the front end as another feature.
But they don't read your messages you're sending to other people, and they don't track messages.
That's a bunch of crap.
Yeah, that's what I've been saying to the people that have been sending me these.
I just tell them that by sending these messages, you're annoying the crap out of other people, and you're just showing how ignorant you are.
I mean, you know...
Using the prior example I gave, Microsoft exclusives aren't going to remain Microsoft exclusives.
Pics will fly out for some reason before those exclusives will show up on PS3 and vice versa.
Exactly.
That kind of stuff is just ridiculous that the exclusives would make their way to Sony.
I mean, people ought to know better.
Did you have any other topics for us tonight, Spatineer?
No, pretty much covers it.
I'll probably let you go.
I would imagine you probably want to squeeze in one more call and maybe close off afterwards.
Alright, here's a good one.
Hi, you're on Orange Radio.
Who's this?
Legend of Zaku.
Hopefully now.
Yes, we can hear you loud and clear.
What's up, Legend of Zaku?
Nothing much, just trying to kill another dull weekend aside from the Yanks winning.
But yeah, I mean...
Um, basically, from what I've been seeing so far, PSP Go has been getting a lot of flack.
Most of it's actually deserving.
Just for the fact that Sony is just not, they just haven't made it easy for existing PSP owners to give them the incentive to switch on.
Especially when transferring existing UMDs.
Did you see that story earlier this week where Reggie Fils-Aimé has even come out and said, I don't get the PSP Go, basically?
Actually, I think he's right for the fact that, for the most part, every upgrade to the DS allowed people to play their old existing games.
So in that sense, Sony's basically going two steps forward, one step back.
Actually, no, wait, what am I saying?
Two steps backward, one step forward.
I like this.
That's all right.
I like this, what Toagak says in our chat, and I probably horribly mispronounced that name.
I apologize.
But Toagak says, PSP go equals PSP no.
Exactly.
I mean, I have my original PSP.
I mean, I have my slim PSP, and I love it.
You know, I love that thing to death just because I can play UMDs on it.
So any new game that's still coming out, at least I have a hard copy of it.
That's like something you'd see on a protest sign in a march or something.
Sonic the Hedgehog
so it doesn't give people that incentive to just impulsively buy that new system.
I want to read this comment in chat here real quick.
Kitsune in chat says the PSP Go is only for those who don't already have a PSP and I understand that point and I almost would agree with it, almost except I feel like with the PSP Go you get less choice than you have with the PSP 3000.
Right, I mean you can't even sell, everything's digital there's no second hand sales of
If there was a faster processor, a second analog, something else in here, PS2 capability of games, something else in here I could recommend, I would be all about that.
Right, if it was a brand new PSP, a second...
A new version of it, a completely new version outside of the fact that there's already been three so far.
I mean, that would be more than enough, but if it's more of the same with just like superficial tacked on features like Bluetooth, which should have been in recent PSP iterations already, it just feels like Sony's like, you know, they're fucking up.
You're preaching to the choir here and it's tough because we want to give Sony credit for the things they're doing right on the PlayStation 3, but then you can't turn the blind eye to go.
But the PSP, they're just acting like a bunch of chickens with their heads cut off because they don't even know how to make a product that not only new people would want, but the existing base.
If you can't woo them, then that thing is dead in the water.
I agree.
What else is on your mind tonight, Zaku?
Nothing much, except for the fact that a few weeks ago I did attend an old-timers DDR tournament on the break, even though I didn't compete.
It was basically a 32-man mixed tournament that took hours to complete.
So that was the other highlight of these past few weeks.
Eight on the breaks, a good arcade.
I've been there, of course, and I haven't been there in a few years.
Well, they put FitMix already.
They've been having that for months.
And during Kings of the Coast, their big tournament in August, they were running a 4th Mix Plus tournament.
So, yeah, they're really throwing it back over there.
My love for 8 on the Break isn't just with the music games, but the fact that I didn't feel like the place was overrun with redemption games.
Not only that, it's like cheap food.
$4 would pretty much fill your stomach.
Good point, although I wouldn't want to live on that food, if you know what I mean.
All right.
Zachu, we're going to let you go to try and maybe squeeze in one more call, but thank you so much for the call.
Okay, buddy?
All right.
Have a good one.
Go Yankees.
Yes.
I always say that because my coworker loves the – I don't follow baseball.
My coworker loves the Yankees, so I know that if the Yankees win, it's going to be a good day at work tomorrow because people will be happy.
So actually I think that's going to do it for the Skype line tonight.
So sorry to those that didn't get through, but you can always send us an email to mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com.
PXP MP5
And I had to laugh though because some of the specs on it, like it had a built-in camera, it could play emulation games and stuff like that.
I'm like, wow, that's already better than the PSP Go.
But yeah, I would imagine the camera's pretty low quality and all that stuff.
It is a lot cheaper though, but...
It'll be interesting to see how much it actually sells.
And I don't even know if we'll be able to tell that because it's going to be the PlayStation portable platform and not necessarily the PSP Go.
But yeah, I bet you it's going to just slump off to nothing by the time the holiday comes around.
Are you able to figure out the real sales figures for PSP Go?
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
I want frozen yogurt, but I'm not going to have any.
Frozen Yogurt
Did you win last?
I don't remember.
I didn't win anything because my song was all fucked up.
We'll talk about it during Afterbirth.
Loki, your final thought tonight.
I need to move the cabinet into the house and then the next project is to rebuild the DDR pads.
I already have them designed and everything.
They're going to be awesome.
my final thought for the day is happy national coming out day and equality for all means just that equal rights for all equal equal equal there is no such thing as a domestic partnership being equal rights in any way shape or form I had one of my friends actually it's funny that you mentioned that last weekend he came up and stuff he came out to me he's been apparently married
He got married during that time, too.
That it was legal.
Oh, as part of the 18,000.
Oh, I thought you meant this was like a married man to a woman who came out to you.
Because that could be very difficult.
I've met men who have gone through that.
No, no, no.
No idea whatsoever.
But he's had a boyfriend ever since.
Even during when he came to our wedding and stuff.
You've actually met him.
But...
I was like, why didn't you bring him?
I'm like, that would have been okay.
But he's not coming out there but yet.
I met a lot of people at your wedding, so I probably wouldn't remember him.
But props.
California is the only state where some marriages are legal and they don't know how to explain how it works.
Let me give you a hint, California.
Here's how to get it right.
Equal, equal, equal across the board.
That's how you do it.
There's no reason for it.
No religious text should ever take away equality.
Ever.
So.
Anyhow.
That's it.
I'll get off my soapbox now.
That's going to do it for another episode of Orange Launch Radio.
Thank you guys so much for tuning in to us.
We had a really good listener count tonight, especially considering we've been off for a week.
So that must mean you missed us.
So thank you very much.
And you don't hate us too much for falling behind on the podcast feed and all that stuff.
I think their aim is improving.
I bet so too but we'll be back next week to do it all again I don't know if we have anything special planned for next week unfortunately we're not doing the big gaming marathon next week but if you aren't already tuning into it somewhere please be sure you're watching the Extra Life Marathon somewhere that's all Sarcastic Gamer and other podcasts is doing that and you know we are all for the Extra Life Marathon that is going to happen around the internet on Saturday so please look for that and donate
I'm sure there'll be other ones later on.
Oh, yeah.
We'll participate in something later on, for sure.
A good cause somewhere.
But that's going to do it for now.
For us, have a great week, everybody.
We'll see you next week on Orange Lounge Radio.
If you've enjoyed the show, all we ask, you just tell a couple people about the show.
