00:00.000 --> 00:03.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:07.000 --> 00:13.000
With your hosts, Dark Sakura, Sky, and Roto!

00:14.000 --> 00:19.000
Tonight, October 18th, 2009, playing early bootlegs get you banned from Xbox,

00:19.000 --> 00:22.000
the PSP series gains heavy product placement tie-ins,

00:22.000 --> 00:26.000
and the classic arcade racer returns in high dev.

00:26.000 --> 00:30.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:31.000 --> 00:35.000
Well hello everybody and welcome to another edition of Orange Lounge Radio.

00:35.000 --> 00:39.000
We are that radio talk show dedicated to video games,

00:39.000 --> 00:42.000
video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.

00:42.000 --> 00:45.000
My name is Rob Roberts and I'm here with you every week,

00:45.000 --> 00:48.000
as well as the one and only Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.

00:49.000 --> 00:50.000
How you doing?

00:51.000 --> 00:52.000
That good, huh?

00:52.000 --> 00:56.000
Will you actually be speaking tonight or just communicating in grunts?

00:56.000 --> 00:57.000
Alright, fine.

00:57.000 --> 01:00.000
Also say hello to the hopefully better spoken tonight, Loki.

01:00.000 --> 01:01.000
Hello.

01:01.000 --> 01:02.000
How you doing, Techmaster Loki?

01:02.000 --> 01:03.000
I'm doing fine.

01:03.000 --> 01:04.000
Awesome.

01:04.000 --> 01:07.000
A little bit before the show tonight, just before we went live,

01:07.000 --> 01:09.000
sadly Bobby wasn't on tonight, but you know,

01:09.000 --> 01:13.000
Bobby Blackwolf needs a break too once in a while and he had other stuff going on.

01:13.000 --> 01:15.000
But we were live on the feed a little early tonight,

01:15.000 --> 01:17.000
and Loki was playing some more DJ Hero.

01:17.000 --> 01:18.000
Yes I was.

01:18.000 --> 01:20.000
So we got to hear, and you have the full version now.

01:20.000 --> 01:21.000
Yes I do.

01:21.000 --> 01:22.000
We got to hear some of the mixes,

01:22.000 --> 01:24.000
so I'm kind of curious what our chat thought of what they got to hear.

01:24.000 --> 01:26.000
Sadly, you know, we can't reproduce it for the podcast

01:26.000 --> 01:27.000
because of copyright and all that,

01:27.000 --> 01:30.000
but we were playing the, what was that?

01:30.000 --> 01:33.000
It was Eric Pride's Tears for Fears.

01:33.000 --> 01:37.000
Oh yeah, Eric Pride's Piano versus Tears for Fears Shout,

01:37.000 --> 01:41.000
and then of course MC Hammer with Can't Touch This and...

01:41.000 --> 01:42.000
Vanilla Ice, right?

01:42.000 --> 01:43.000
Vanilla Ice Ice Ice Baby.

01:43.000 --> 01:47.000
Which was sounding really epic in the beginning, but got a little...

01:47.000 --> 01:50.000
It's not one of the better tracks on there,

01:50.000 --> 01:52.000
so there's a lot of good tracks in there, I mean,

01:52.000 --> 01:54.000
and we'll get into that later, but it's...

01:54.000 --> 01:56.000
I'm not disappointed at all.

01:56.000 --> 01:57.000
Well we'll get into that in just a minute,

01:57.000 --> 01:59.000
I know Loki wants to talk about that during his gaming week,

01:59.000 --> 02:03.000
but first I need to plug our lovely bandwidth hosts,

02:03.000 --> 02:07.000
the one and only www.allgames.com, All Games Radio,

02:07.000 --> 02:10.000
always helps us out by letting us steal their bandwidth every Sunday night,

02:10.000 --> 02:12.000
and they are the home to a bunch of great programs,

02:12.000 --> 02:16.000
not just Bobby who's usually on before us when he's not, you know, in a drumline,

02:16.000 --> 02:18.000
but then as well as a host of other programs

02:18.000 --> 02:21.000
such as Escapist Listening Lounge, Video Game Outsiders,

02:21.000 --> 02:23.000
Electric Sisterhood, Dead Pixel Live, blah blah blah,

02:23.000 --> 02:25.000
the list goes on and on, it's great.

02:25.000 --> 02:28.000
All Games Radio, www.allgames.com.

02:28.000 --> 02:31.000
We tape live Sunday nights at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern,

02:31.000 --> 02:34.000
and if you've never listened to Orange Launch Radio live before,

02:34.000 --> 02:36.000
well, why not? Sad.

02:36.000 --> 02:38.000
You should come join us some Sunday,

02:38.000 --> 02:42.000
and if you are hearing this on a Sunday night that happens to be October 18th,

02:42.000 --> 02:45.000
then we actually are live, and you are tuned into All Games Radio,

02:45.000 --> 02:47.000
and you know that we're going to start off the show, as we always do,

02:47.000 --> 02:49.000
with a little bit of How Is Your Gaming Week.

02:49.000 --> 02:51.000
DarkSakura, what types of video games have you been playing this week?

02:51.000 --> 02:53.000
Mmm.

02:53.000 --> 02:56.000
You do have to speak at some point during this radio show.

02:56.000 --> 02:57.000
Okay.

02:57.000 --> 02:58.000
I'm fine.

02:58.000 --> 02:59.000
I play Peggle.

02:59.000 --> 03:01.000
And how is Peggle?

03:01.000 --> 03:02.000
Pegglerific.

03:02.000 --> 03:03.000
Yeah?

03:03.000 --> 03:06.000
Um, I downloaded a bunch of crap for Sims,

03:06.000 --> 03:09.000
and now it's making my game kind of fart while it's loading.

03:09.000 --> 03:10.000
Sorry to hear it.

03:10.000 --> 03:13.000
Yeah, I accidentally started installing a bunch of cute clothes,

03:13.000 --> 03:15.000
and then I found out after I was already installing them

03:15.000 --> 03:17.000
that they were for Sims 2,

03:17.000 --> 03:19.000
and me being a lazy-ass just didn't bother

03:19.000 --> 03:21.000
because I figured the game just wouldn't recognize it.

03:21.000 --> 03:24.000
So, I've been reading a lot of comics.

03:24.000 --> 03:26.000
What type of comics?

03:26.000 --> 03:28.000
Um, I will pull...

03:28.000 --> 03:31.000
Oh, look, my game decides to start working now.

03:31.000 --> 03:33.000
I'm going to build a house live on air.

03:33.000 --> 03:38.000
Deadpool 900, including the epic story of Deadpool vs. Mimes.

03:38.000 --> 03:40.000
We have Deadpool vs. Mimes?

03:40.000 --> 03:42.000
Yes, look at the cover.

03:42.000 --> 03:44.000
That's not a very fair fight, if you ask me.

03:44.000 --> 03:47.000
They're mimes that are powered with psychological weapons

03:47.000 --> 03:50.000
that their mymery actually causes real damage.

03:50.000 --> 03:51.000
Their mymery?

03:51.000 --> 03:52.000
Their mymery.

03:52.000 --> 03:53.000
Mimicry.

03:53.000 --> 03:55.000
No mymery. I like the word mymery.

03:55.000 --> 03:57.000
Knock that miming off.

03:57.000 --> 03:58.000
I've had to play with...

03:58.000 --> 03:59.000
You know...

03:59.000 --> 04:01.000
I've had to play with your audio a little bit, by the way.

04:01.000 --> 04:03.000
If you are hearing Dark Soccer kind of fade in and out,

04:03.000 --> 04:06.000
it's live radio. That kind of thing happens.

04:06.000 --> 04:07.000
We adjust audio on the fly sometimes.

04:07.000 --> 04:08.000
Because remember, though...

04:08.000 --> 04:09.000
What?

04:09.000 --> 04:11.000
A mime is a wonderful thing to waste.

04:11.000 --> 04:12.000
Shut up.

04:12.000 --> 04:15.000
Hey, wait. I have an idea for a new segment, though, Dark Sakura.

04:15.000 --> 04:16.000
What?

04:16.000 --> 04:17.000
We're gonna do a segment called

04:17.000 --> 04:20.000
Dark Sakura Reviews Games Through Grunting.

04:20.000 --> 04:21.000
You ready?

04:21.000 --> 04:22.000
What game should I review?

04:22.000 --> 04:26.000
I'm gonna name some games and you review them with a grunt.

04:26.000 --> 04:27.000
Okay.

04:27.000 --> 04:28.000
We'll start with something easy.

04:28.000 --> 04:30.000
Sims 3.

04:30.000 --> 04:34.000
Marvel Ultimate Alliance.

04:34.000 --> 04:39.000
Yaris.

04:39.000 --> 04:41.000
DJ Hero.

04:41.000 --> 04:42.000
Alright.

04:42.000 --> 04:44.000
Speaking of which, I don't know if there's anything else.

04:44.000 --> 04:47.000
Loki, do you have anything you want Dark Sakura to review with a grunt?

04:47.000 --> 04:48.000
No.

04:48.000 --> 04:49.000
Alright.

04:49.000 --> 04:50.000
I can't think of anything else.

04:50.000 --> 04:51.000
There's Shadow Complex.

04:51.000 --> 04:54.000
Okay, Shadow Complex.

04:54.000 --> 04:57.000
Bayonetta.

04:57.000 --> 04:58.000
Alright.

04:58.000 --> 05:00.000
Cheater. That's not even out yet.

05:00.000 --> 05:01.000
Alright.

05:01.000 --> 05:03.000
It's pretty, though.

05:03.000 --> 05:06.000
She's wearing her hair.

05:06.000 --> 05:09.000
Loki, how was your gaming week?

05:09.000 --> 05:11.000
It was good.

05:11.000 --> 05:15.000
Played lots of Grand Theft Auto, Lost and Damned.

05:15.000 --> 05:18.000
There's been rumors going out there, and I've seen it now,

05:18.000 --> 05:21.000
that people have found a way around the patch so they can re-enable mods again.

05:21.000 --> 05:23.000
And I've been trying to figure out how to do that.

05:23.000 --> 05:28.000
And I'm close, but what I thought I needed to change actually freezes the game up.

05:28.000 --> 05:33.000
So, not quite there yet, but I'm on the path to getting it done.

05:33.000 --> 05:37.000
And I've obviously been playing lots of DJ Hero.

05:37.000 --> 05:41.000
I played it for a few hours today and yesterday.

05:41.000 --> 05:45.000
Most of the game starts off locked when most of the tracks you can play.

05:45.000 --> 05:48.000
So I've actually unlocked almost everything in the game so far.

05:48.000 --> 05:50.000
I mean, that's how much I've been playing it.

05:50.000 --> 05:54.000
And if you played it at, say, a Best Buy or GameStop or something like that

05:54.000 --> 05:58.000
and thought it was too easy, trust me, those songs are nothing

05:58.000 --> 06:00.000
compared to the stuff that's in the game.

06:00.000 --> 06:02.000
It's fucking hard even on medium.

06:02.000 --> 06:04.000
That's what I've been playing it on.

06:04.000 --> 06:07.000
I mean, you bump it up to Expert or something like that.

06:07.000 --> 06:09.000
It's just insane.

06:09.000 --> 06:12.000
So I wouldn't be worried by that.

06:12.000 --> 06:15.000
But yeah, nothing like BeatMania, obviously.

06:15.000 --> 06:17.000
But great track lists.

06:17.000 --> 06:20.000
I mean, there's not really any songs I haven't liked in the game.

06:20.000 --> 06:23.000
I mean, there's some that have been okay, but there's none that I really hate.

06:23.000 --> 06:25.000
I mean, it's just overall good.

06:25.000 --> 06:28.000
I like playing all of them.

06:28.000 --> 06:30.000
And for the live folks, you're going to spin some more songs.

06:30.000 --> 06:32.000
Oh yeah, we'll play more songs during the break.

06:32.000 --> 06:34.000
Awesome.

06:34.000 --> 06:37.000
Anything else, or is this DJ Hero or DG Hero all week long?

06:37.000 --> 06:38.000
That's what I've been doing.

06:38.000 --> 06:39.000
All right, sounds good.

06:39.000 --> 06:40.000
My Gaming Week.

06:40.000 --> 06:42.000
Sadly, I don't have a lot of new games, really.

06:42.000 --> 06:44.000
There's only one new game I can think of to review,

06:44.000 --> 06:46.000
and it's actually something I've been playing a couple weeks.

06:46.000 --> 06:48.000
I just have yet to mention it on the show.

06:48.000 --> 06:52.000
It's a PlayStation Network game, and it's called Digger.

06:52.000 --> 06:56.000
And I guess it's based off an old Apple IIe game or something.

06:56.000 --> 06:58.000
I had never played the original game.

06:58.000 --> 07:02.000
It's kind of like if Dig Dug met Mr. Doom,

07:02.000 --> 07:07.000
met Pac-Man, met a lot of other classic 80s games,

07:07.000 --> 07:09.000
kind of all in one little hodgepodge of a game.

07:09.000 --> 07:11.000
You can play the game in classic mode,

07:11.000 --> 07:15.000
which is why I can kind of tell that this game was either originally on Apple II

07:15.000 --> 07:17.000
or the old school CGA,

07:17.000 --> 07:20.000
because that's the kind of graphics it has, the CGA graphics in classic mode.

07:20.000 --> 07:23.000
But you don't download games on PlayStation Network

07:23.000 --> 07:25.000
to play them in four colors now, do you?

07:25.000 --> 07:27.000
Obviously, the game's been fleshed out with a whole new high def mode,

07:27.000 --> 07:29.000
and pretty crisp graphics.

07:29.000 --> 07:33.000
So if you're into retro gaming, I think you'll kind of like this,

07:33.000 --> 07:35.000
especially because it combines the elements of all these old games.

07:35.000 --> 07:39.000
I like a lot of the retro games, though.

07:39.000 --> 07:42.000
It can get a little repetitive, so be warned.

07:42.000 --> 07:44.000
But they do try to throw in some things to make it interesting,

07:44.000 --> 07:48.000
like co-op survival and co-op collaborative mode,

07:48.000 --> 07:50.000
and a whole crap ton of levels.

07:50.000 --> 07:54.000
My only complaint is that it was hard for me to kind of pick up and go with the game.

07:54.000 --> 07:58.000
There's no tutorial or mode that teaches you how to play the game.

07:58.000 --> 08:01.000
I guess they figure a lot of people are going to want to download this

08:01.000 --> 08:03.000
because of the retro vibe going on,

08:03.000 --> 08:06.000
but that's a lot harder to do with a game like Digger

08:06.000 --> 08:08.000
than, say, a game like Pac-Man.

08:08.000 --> 08:10.000
I don't know, because everybody fucking knows Pac-Man.

08:10.000 --> 08:14.000
I had never heard of Digger until I decided to download this game,

08:14.000 --> 08:17.000
and I was like, oh, retro gaming classic, maybe I'll like it.

08:17.000 --> 08:20.000
Unfortunately, there's no demo out there for it, so I took a risk.

08:20.000 --> 08:24.000
But not bad. I'm not depressed with the money I spent,

08:24.000 --> 08:28.000
but I don't think it's a wow, OMG, run out and buy it right now type game either.

08:28.000 --> 08:30.000
I think if you like the old retro classics,

08:30.000 --> 08:34.000
you like your 80s PC games, you'll get a kick out of this.

08:34.000 --> 08:37.000
But maybe you'll find out faster than I did

08:37.000 --> 08:39.000
that there's actually a fire button,

08:39.000 --> 08:41.000
and you can actually shoot the oncoming enemies

08:41.000 --> 08:44.000
that makes the game a little easier when you feel a little overwhelmed,

08:44.000 --> 08:45.000
because I had no idea.

08:45.000 --> 08:48.000
There's no tutorial or nothing to kind of get you going with the game.

08:48.000 --> 08:50.000
So that's my one little piece of feedback for it.

08:50.000 --> 08:55.000
Otherwise, OMG, World of Warcraft, LOL, WTFBBQ.

08:55.000 --> 08:57.000
I was looking for donations, by the way.

08:57.000 --> 08:58.000
Are you?

08:58.000 --> 08:59.000
Yeah.

08:59.000 --> 09:00.000
Everybody's looking for donations on the show.

09:00.000 --> 09:02.000
Well, no, I mean, because I can't.

09:02.000 --> 09:03.000
I know, I know.

09:03.000 --> 09:07.000
But I am up to level 52 on my paladin.

09:07.000 --> 09:09.000
I just hit 52 before the show tonight,

09:09.000 --> 09:13.000
which isn't bad considering I think she rolled on September 3rd or 4th,

09:13.000 --> 09:15.000
so I haven't been playing that long,

09:15.000 --> 09:17.000
and I don't have triple XP or anything like that,

09:17.000 --> 09:19.000
so I'm happy.

09:19.000 --> 09:22.000
So that's it for my gaming week pretty much.

09:22.000 --> 09:24.000
Otherwise, the same type of stuff I already talked about last week,

09:24.000 --> 09:27.000
like Demon's Souls and Katamari Forever and all that fun stuff.

09:27.000 --> 09:29.000
So now that we've talked about our gaming weeks,

09:29.000 --> 09:32.000
let's get into some housekeeping real quick,

09:32.000 --> 09:34.000
but actually not a lot for that segment either.

09:34.000 --> 09:39.000
So I'm just going to plug our Twitter at www.Twitter.com slash O-L-R,

09:39.000 --> 09:41.000
and of course we also have our Facebook community.

09:41.000 --> 09:42.000
Just search for O-L Army.

09:42.000 --> 09:45.000
By the way, we're going to create an actual page on there too.

09:45.000 --> 09:47.000
I can't remember if I mentioned this last week or not.

09:47.000 --> 09:49.000
I was going to work on that more this week,

09:49.000 --> 09:51.000
but I got sidetracked leveling a paladin,

09:51.000 --> 09:53.000
so I'm hopefully going to get that done.

09:53.000 --> 09:57.000
Actually, we had a lot of shows that we were behind on the feed too.

09:57.000 --> 09:59.000
Three shows went up this week on the podcast feed,

09:59.000 --> 10:01.000
so you can't say I didn't do anything for O-L-R.

10:01.000 --> 10:04.000
I got that just about caught up.

10:04.000 --> 10:07.000
And yeah, so look for that on Facebook,

10:07.000 --> 10:10.000
and we have a MySpace if anyone actually uses that anymore.

10:10.000 --> 10:12.000
Does anyone use MySpace anymore? I don't think so.

10:12.000 --> 10:18.000
The last thing I did on MySpace was look at my art history teacher's blog.

10:18.000 --> 10:20.000
The last thing I did on MySpace was block spammers.

10:20.000 --> 10:22.000
Nellie looked at MySpace the other day and she's like,

10:22.000 --> 10:24.000
wow, it looks like Facebook now.

10:24.000 --> 10:28.000
They did change some stuff on there to try and make it more Facebook-y, I guess,

10:28.000 --> 10:30.000
but I don't like it anymore.

10:30.000 --> 10:31.000
Facebook did something that makes me happy.

10:31.000 --> 10:32.000
What's that?

10:32.000 --> 10:35.000
I can now block everything I don't freaking want to see.

10:35.000 --> 10:38.000
I can keep from getting this stupid sorority life invites.

10:38.000 --> 10:40.000
They've had that for months.

10:40.000 --> 10:43.000
But they haven't had it in an easy-to-access place.

10:43.000 --> 10:45.000
You had to go into your profile and everything,

10:45.000 --> 10:48.000
and I would set it all up through my profile and I'd still get all the shit.

10:48.000 --> 10:50.000
Because the apps get smart and they work around them.

10:50.000 --> 10:53.000
They exploit every little thing Facebook will let you do.

10:53.000 --> 10:56.000
Now I can just hide and I don't ever have to see it again.

10:56.000 --> 10:57.000
Yay.

10:57.000 --> 10:59.000
All right, that's what Twitter needs, by the way.

10:59.000 --> 11:01.000
O-M-G, does Twitter need a hide button?

11:01.000 --> 11:03.000
Twitter needs a filter.

11:03.000 --> 11:06.000
All right. Anyhow, let's move on.

11:06.000 --> 11:09.000
Let's talk less ranting on social networking and more gaming news.

11:09.000 --> 11:11.000
We'll start off tonight.

11:11.000 --> 11:13.000
The wonderful Loki is going to start us off tonight.

11:13.000 --> 11:16.000
Yes, Nintendo has partnered up with Capcom

11:16.000 --> 11:19.000
and 53 other video game publishers in Japan

11:19.000 --> 11:23.000
to file suit against four resellers of the popular R4 flash cartridge.

11:23.000 --> 11:26.000
You know, the one that modded the pirate stuff.

11:26.000 --> 11:32.000
Apparently, though, in Tokyo court it banned the sale of the devices.

11:32.000 --> 11:37.000
However, these four retailers are kind of ignoring that.

11:37.000 --> 11:42.000
So there's a new lawsuit now that finally stopped these guys from selling it.

11:42.000 --> 11:46.000
I mean, it's kind of interesting if you think about it

11:46.000 --> 11:51.000
because they've been making threats about this stuff for a while now.

11:51.000 --> 11:54.000
And I kind of find it funny that they're really only targeting the R4

11:54.000 --> 11:57.000
because that is the most widely known backup device.

11:57.000 --> 12:00.000
But there's tons of them out there.

12:00.000 --> 12:05.000
I mean, the R4, I don't even think it's being used as much nowadays

12:05.000 --> 12:07.000
as some of these other ones.

12:07.000 --> 12:08.000
I don't know.

12:08.000 --> 12:10.000
But I guess it's a start

12:10.000 --> 12:14.000
because I know piracy really eats into the DS sales.

12:14.000 --> 12:16.000
Especially overseas, right?

12:16.000 --> 12:18.000
They have more of a problem with this overseas than they do here, right?

12:18.000 --> 12:20.000
Definitely.

12:20.000 --> 12:22.000
Are you surprised by this move?

12:22.000 --> 12:26.000
I mean, I can't think of anything quite like this that I've heard of recently.

12:26.000 --> 12:27.000
Well, it makes sense.

12:27.000 --> 12:31.000
I mean, the court already banned the sales of this stuff.

12:31.000 --> 12:33.000
They went ahead and ignored the law.

12:33.000 --> 12:36.000
I guess they're going to have a lawsuit put against them.

12:36.000 --> 12:37.000
I don't know.

12:37.000 --> 12:39.000
It's not surprising, I guess.

12:39.000 --> 12:40.000
Yeah.

12:40.000 --> 12:42.000
Okay.

12:42.000 --> 12:46.000
Do you think there's a legitimate purpose for someone having an R4

12:46.000 --> 12:48.000
or is this just straight-up piracy?

12:48.000 --> 12:51.000
I mean, is there any type of way that they could come into court and say,

12:51.000 --> 12:54.000
oh, well, this R4 has a legitimate purpose

12:54.000 --> 12:57.000
or is it just 100% piracy?

12:57.000 --> 13:00.000
It does have a legitimate purpose as far as enabling homebrew,

13:00.000 --> 13:05.000
but once again, though, it's kind of reverse engineering the DS

13:05.000 --> 13:09.000
sort of to make it work, that kind of stuff.

13:09.000 --> 13:14.000
So yeah, it might allow for homebrew stuff,

13:14.000 --> 13:19.000
but any of the homebrew enabling patches, mods, whatever out there so far

13:19.000 --> 13:24.000
have been pretty much stomped out by any game hardware manufacturer.

13:24.000 --> 13:27.000
I mean, look at Sony with the PSP firmwares.

13:27.000 --> 13:29.000
Yeah, it enables homebrew, but people use the pirate stuff,

13:29.000 --> 13:31.000
so they've been stomping that out.

13:31.000 --> 13:33.000
Look at the Wii, the homebrew channel.

13:33.000 --> 13:37.000
I mean, also used for homebrew, but also used for piracy.

13:37.000 --> 13:40.000
They've tried to stomp that out, and then now with the DS,

13:40.000 --> 13:45.000
with the flash cards, they're trying, and they keep making changes to it.

13:45.000 --> 13:47.000
It's hard, though, with the Wii.

13:47.000 --> 13:50.000
Well, I should say not even the Wii, but the DS,

13:50.000 --> 13:53.000
not so much with the DSi now because I think you can patch that

13:53.000 --> 13:56.000
with firmware upgrades, but with the DS,

13:56.000 --> 14:01.000
so you can't add any firmware upgrades to it, so you're pretty much stuck.

14:01.000 --> 14:05.000
If someone gets one of those, maybe later on some of the games

14:05.000 --> 14:08.000
will patch it so that you can't play those ROMs or whatever

14:08.000 --> 14:12.000
on your R4 device, but the ones that are already made out there,

14:12.000 --> 14:14.000
there's nothing they can do about it because they can't patch it.

14:14.000 --> 14:16.000
I've got a wild question for you.

14:16.000 --> 14:19.000
Isn't homebrew piracy in a way?

14:19.000 --> 14:22.000
I mean, any homebrew that's cooked up,

14:22.000 --> 14:26.000
because aren't you supposed to buy a very expensive kit from Nintendo

14:26.000 --> 14:29.000
or Sony or whoever it is to develop for the system?

14:29.000 --> 14:30.000
No.

14:30.000 --> 14:32.000
Are you supposed to buy these very expensive kits to help you develop?

14:32.000 --> 14:34.000
If you were to put something out in market,

14:34.000 --> 14:36.000
then maybe that wouldn't necessarily be piracy,

14:36.000 --> 14:38.000
but it would be unauthorized,

14:38.000 --> 14:41.000
because of all the stipulations that they have,

14:41.000 --> 14:43.000
the testing process that has to go through,

14:43.000 --> 14:45.000
and development kits and whatnot.

14:45.000 --> 14:50.000
Then, yeah, to be in market, you'd have to be an authorized developer,

14:50.000 --> 14:52.000
but this isn't really in market.

14:52.000 --> 14:54.000
This is just kind of crap that they're throwing on there.

14:54.000 --> 14:57.000
But it encourages people to hack their stuff, right?

14:57.000 --> 14:59.000
People are going to hack it no matter what,

14:59.000 --> 15:01.000
whether the carts are out there or something else.

15:01.000 --> 15:03.000
I mean, they'll find a way around it.

15:03.000 --> 15:05.000
All right.

15:05.000 --> 15:08.000
Well, I'm going to our chat room at chat.orangelandradio.com,

15:08.000 --> 15:11.000
and it looks like there's just other devices out there.

15:11.000 --> 15:13.000
Azure Edge says, I have Ace Card 2.

15:13.000 --> 15:16.000
I've never heard of this, but I guess that's another similar device?

15:16.000 --> 15:18.000
Yeah, there's the Ace Card.

15:18.000 --> 15:21.000
There's Cyclo DS, Evolution.

15:21.000 --> 15:25.000
They've also got the M3.

15:25.000 --> 15:29.000
I think the D6 or something like that.

15:29.000 --> 15:31.000
So why are we just hearing about the R4 then?

15:31.000 --> 15:35.000
Because it's the popular one, I guess.

15:35.000 --> 15:37.000
It's just like, you know, like Napster.

15:37.000 --> 15:40.000
Remember, there was Napster and a lot of other file-sharing services,

15:40.000 --> 15:42.000
but everyone went after Napster because...

15:42.000 --> 15:45.000
Oh, yeah, LimeWire, Virus Heaven. I remember that one.

15:45.000 --> 15:48.000
Well, I'm just saying that there were other services out there,

15:48.000 --> 15:50.000
but, you know, they're going to go after them.

15:50.000 --> 15:51.000
Just like Pirate Bay.

15:51.000 --> 15:54.000
They're going after Pirate Bay because that's the most...

15:54.000 --> 15:57.000
I guess they're making an example out of them or something like that.

15:57.000 --> 16:02.000
Yeah, but they really can't do anything about Pirate Bay

16:02.000 --> 16:05.000
unless they get international law changed or...

16:05.000 --> 16:07.000
Didn't Pirate Bay have to stop?

16:07.000 --> 16:08.000
Didn't something happen with that?

16:08.000 --> 16:10.000
I mean, I don't know. I don't use Pirate Bay.

16:10.000 --> 16:12.000
It did, but it's still up.

16:12.000 --> 16:14.000
So I don't really know.

16:14.000 --> 16:16.000
I guess it didn't work very well.

16:16.000 --> 16:17.000
Going to our chat again, Tiger Claw says,

16:17.000 --> 16:20.000
Homebrew is also used to create applications that can be useful

16:20.000 --> 16:24.000
for non-gaming purposes, like listening to internet radio and such.

16:24.000 --> 16:26.000
Hey, I guess that would be useful, wouldn't it?

16:26.000 --> 16:28.000
For programs like this.

16:28.000 --> 16:31.000
Well, it's also the kind of, you know,

16:31.000 --> 16:35.000
put the applications and features that you want on a certain console.

16:35.000 --> 16:39.000
It's a way to build those in where, you know,

16:39.000 --> 16:41.000
said company is not putting them in.

16:41.000 --> 16:45.000
And actually some companies, like Sony, have learned from the Homebrew community

16:45.000 --> 16:48.000
and have seen what they've put in there

16:48.000 --> 16:51.000
and have added that support in later on.

16:51.000 --> 16:56.000
Sometimes little things kind of get endorsed, too.

16:56.000 --> 16:58.000
I seem to remember, you know, speaking of,

16:58.000 --> 17:01.000
because Tiger Claw's comment kind of made me think of internet radio on the Wii,

17:01.000 --> 17:04.000
there was a program a while back, and I can't remember the name of it,

17:04.000 --> 17:06.000
and I don't even know if it's still developed,

17:06.000 --> 17:10.000
but it was a program that was supposed to let you get podcasts on your Wii,

17:10.000 --> 17:12.000
like it downloaded them to some program,

17:12.000 --> 17:14.000
or sorry, not the Wii, the Xbox 360.

17:14.000 --> 17:16.000
You could get podcasts on the 360,

17:16.000 --> 17:17.000
and I remember it was really controversial

17:17.000 --> 17:19.000
because all the podcasts that were in it by default,

17:19.000 --> 17:22.000
it was downloading like the last five episodes all at once.

17:22.000 --> 17:24.000
Maybe somebody in chat can remember the name of this.

17:24.000 --> 17:28.000
Because I remember we were listed in a future version of it

17:28.000 --> 17:30.000
after that bug was taken out,

17:30.000 --> 17:32.000
but the reason why I bring it up is that I seem to remember

17:32.000 --> 17:35.000
like Major Nelson mentioned it on his blog or something,

17:35.000 --> 17:38.000
and that's why the thing got so popular so fast,

17:38.000 --> 17:41.000
and it just screwed the bandwidth of all these sites.

17:41.000 --> 17:44.000
I remember Gamer Andy was pissed about it.

17:44.000 --> 17:46.000
Tiger Claw says it's TV or City,

17:46.000 --> 17:48.000
but that's actually not the one I'm thinking of.

17:48.000 --> 17:51.000
I think that lets you do podcasts also,

17:51.000 --> 17:53.000
but that's not the same one I'm thinking of.

17:53.000 --> 17:55.000
That's what you use for streaming video.

17:55.000 --> 17:56.000
Yeah.

17:56.000 --> 17:58.000
But there was another program, and I can't remember the name,

17:58.000 --> 17:59.000
but it was a couple of years ago.

17:59.000 --> 18:00.000
I don't think it's developed anymore.

18:00.000 --> 18:03.000
If it is, it's not popular, sadly.

18:03.000 --> 18:04.000
I don't know.

18:04.000 --> 18:07.000
But anyhow, maybe somebody else in chat will come up with that later.

18:07.000 --> 18:10.000
Anyhow, moving on to another new story,

18:10.000 --> 18:12.000
something completely different.

18:12.000 --> 18:14.000
Let's talk Pokemans.

18:14.000 --> 18:16.000
OMG Pokemans.

18:16.000 --> 18:17.000
Anyhow, no.

18:17.000 --> 18:18.000
Let me show you them.

18:18.000 --> 18:20.000
There is a new Pokemon game coming out.

18:20.000 --> 18:23.000
It is PokePark Wii, Pikachu's Big Adventure.

18:23.000 --> 18:25.000
Nintendo officially unveiled the game this week,

18:25.000 --> 18:27.000
meaning screenshots and all that fun stuff.

18:27.000 --> 18:29.000
It is coming out in Japan on December 5th.

18:29.000 --> 18:31.000
It'll set you back 4,800 yen.

18:31.000 --> 18:36.000
That would be $53 in exchange rates.

18:36.000 --> 18:42.000
Sadly, though, it's not really a Pokemon Game Boy game on the Wii,

18:42.000 --> 18:45.000
like people have been wanting, oh, I don't know, forever.

18:45.000 --> 18:49.000
Instead, it's a game where you are, of course, Pikachu,

18:49.000 --> 18:51.000
because, you know, one of the Pokemon is nearly as famous,

18:51.000 --> 18:53.000
and you're in, like, a theme park,

18:53.000 --> 18:57.000
and you tag, battle, and participate in quiz minigames.

18:57.000 --> 18:58.000
Oh, joy.

18:58.000 --> 19:01.000
It's another minigame collection on the Nintendo Wii.

19:01.000 --> 19:04.000
Only this time, it has Pokemon.

19:04.000 --> 19:07.000
But my Pokemans, let me show you them.

19:07.000 --> 19:10.000
Also, Pikachu interacts with new friends.

19:10.000 --> 19:14.000
There's also a camera mode to let you photograph the Pokemon you meet.

19:14.000 --> 19:18.000
I guess kind of tipping the hat to Pokemon Snap, which was kind of awesome.

19:18.000 --> 19:21.000
But no words about Mudkips. Sorry, guys.

19:21.000 --> 19:23.000
But Pokemans, Rob.

19:23.000 --> 19:28.000
I know it's Pokemans, but it's not like the Game Boy Pokemon games.

19:28.000 --> 19:30.000
Don't care, Pokemans. It'll sell.

19:30.000 --> 19:32.000
Nintendo prints money.

19:32.000 --> 19:36.000
I guess so, but I'm just like, yay, another minigame collection on the Wii.

19:36.000 --> 19:39.000
Although, to be fair, they're talking about, you know, tagging and battling

19:39.000 --> 19:40.000
and all this other stuff, too.

19:40.000 --> 19:43.000
And I shouldn't judge a game before I play it,

19:43.000 --> 19:46.000
but, you know, you're not giving me a lot to go off of here.

19:46.000 --> 19:48.000
It's not like the Wii has demos, either,

19:48.000 --> 19:51.000
and I'm not going to spend 40 bucks or 50 bucks on a game

19:51.000 --> 19:53.000
just to find out it's another crappy minigame collection.

19:53.000 --> 19:56.000
But, but, but, Rob. Pokemans.

19:56.000 --> 19:59.000
DarkTatsuya in chat says Pokemon Snap needs a sequel.

19:59.000 --> 20:02.000
It sort of does, and maybe that's what they're trying to allude to with this,

20:02.000 --> 20:05.000
but I wouldn't say that this is a sequel by any means.

20:05.000 --> 20:06.000
Now, I'm looking at screenshots,

20:06.000 --> 20:09.000
and here's one where it looks like Pikachu's kind of fighting Charizard

20:09.000 --> 20:13.000
with some timer on the screen doing battle, so I don't, maybe,

20:13.000 --> 20:15.000
maybe there's something cool in there,

20:15.000 --> 20:20.000
but it's not the role-playing Pokemon a lot of you guys have come to know and love,

20:20.000 --> 20:24.000
which I think is the game people really want on the Wii. So.

20:24.000 --> 20:27.000
That's, that's sad and a shame and a travesty.

20:27.000 --> 20:28.000
It is.

20:28.000 --> 20:30.000
It is what else is sad and a shame and a travesty.

20:30.000 --> 20:31.000
What?

20:31.000 --> 20:32.000
What Sega's doing.

20:32.000 --> 20:33.000
What is Sega doing?

20:33.000 --> 20:35.000
Bringing back a piece of my tortured past.

20:35.000 --> 20:36.000
Why?

20:36.000 --> 20:38.000
Into full HD life.

20:38.000 --> 20:41.000
I do not understand. Please elaborate.

20:41.000 --> 20:46.000
Um, I don't ever, if I've ever told you about my nightmares of Daytona USA.

20:46.000 --> 20:49.000
Even if you have, it's probably been years, so tell them again.

20:49.000 --> 20:55.000
I used to, when I worked for my Namco arcade, we had a four-person Daytona USA,

20:55.000 --> 20:57.000
and it would, it would follow me. I would hear,

20:57.000 --> 21:00.000
Daytona!

21:00.000 --> 21:03.000
Or, Rolling Start!

21:03.000 --> 21:05.000
I don't know, like, ugh!

21:05.000 --> 21:06.000
What about Daytona?

21:06.000 --> 21:07.000
That too.

21:07.000 --> 21:11.000
So, um, but it's coming back. It is coming back.

21:11.000 --> 21:15.000
Oh, is it ever, as Sega Racing Classic.

21:15.000 --> 21:18.000
Sega Racing!

21:18.000 --> 21:24.000
And, um, it's gonna be on, uh, the ring-wide, um, arcade hardware,

21:24.000 --> 21:32.000
and, uh, it's being called Sega Racing Classic because they don't have the rights to the Daytona name anymore.

21:32.000 --> 21:34.000
Oh, well that makes sense, I guess.

21:34.000 --> 21:38.000
So I guess we're, we're not gonna get the Daytona.

21:38.000 --> 21:41.000
So, but you know what I want?

21:41.000 --> 21:47.000
Is I want cameos by, um, Pepsiman, and by, um, Sega Tasanchiro.

21:47.000 --> 21:50.000
That would make me happy.

21:50.000 --> 21:54.000
Sega always has the most interesting product placement in their games,

21:54.000 --> 21:56.000
because I think about Crazy Taxi.

21:56.000 --> 21:58.000
I also want to race as the horse in the game.

21:58.000 --> 22:01.000
And, I want a little mini-game in there where you can fight,

22:01.000 --> 22:04.000
make the cars fight each other like Fighter's Megamix.

22:04.000 --> 22:06.000
Uh, xlinc in chat says,

22:06.000 --> 22:08.000
I work at an arcade and I hated that song.

22:08.000 --> 22:11.000
Yes! See, anyone who has worked in an arcade,

22:11.000 --> 22:14.000
where the attract mode is turned sufficiently loud enough,

22:14.000 --> 22:16.000
knows my pain.

22:16.000 --> 22:18.000
Knows my pain.

22:18.000 --> 22:21.000
I'd have nightmares, I'm not kidding, I would have nightmares.

22:21.000 --> 22:22.000
Nightmares.

22:22.000 --> 22:23.000
Nice.

22:23.000 --> 22:26.000
No it's not! It's awful!

22:26.000 --> 22:31.000
How would you like to be in the middle of dreaming about,

22:31.000 --> 22:34.000
you know, so-and-so gorgeous person, and then hear,

22:34.000 --> 22:37.000
DAH! Oh god! Knock it off!

22:37.000 --> 22:41.000
Maybe I don't understand because I've never played this Daytona game.

22:41.000 --> 22:43.000
I just somehow missed it, I guess.

22:43.000 --> 22:49.000
I left Daytona USA at the Luxor the first time I went to Las Vegas,

22:49.000 --> 22:51.000
when it first, when the game first came out,

22:51.000 --> 22:55.000
and had like the eight person big rallies set up.

22:55.000 --> 22:57.000
I thought it was cool then,

22:57.000 --> 22:59.000
that's the last time I ever thought that game was cool.

22:59.000 --> 23:01.000
Wait, don't they have this at Dave & Buster's?

23:01.000 --> 23:03.000
Uh, they have something similar.

23:03.000 --> 23:05.000
I think they have NASCAR, it's like similar to that.

23:05.000 --> 23:09.000
Maybe I played it years ago when they had it at Dave & Buster's, I think.

23:09.000 --> 23:14.000
It was one of those games that they would have linked like 80,000 units.

23:14.000 --> 23:18.000
Rob, you just need to go on YouTube and look up Daytona Rolling Start.

23:18.000 --> 23:20.000
Sure, I'd be happy to.

23:20.000 --> 23:23.000
It's fantastic radio, and this is how everyone would know-

23:23.000 --> 23:25.000
There you go, Tiger Claw linked the theme in the chat room.

23:25.000 --> 23:27.000
Yeah.

23:30.000 --> 23:34.000
Dude, Tiger Claw is like faster at researching stuff than I am.

23:34.000 --> 23:36.000
I've already been on it.

23:36.000 --> 23:39.000
I'm saying that because there's like a 45 second delay.

23:46.000 --> 23:48.000
I have played this game.

23:48.000 --> 23:49.000
Yes, you have.

23:49.000 --> 23:50.000
Yes, I have.

23:50.000 --> 23:55.000
Now that I'm not hearing your horrible karaoke rendition of it, I recognize it.

23:55.000 --> 23:57.000
You need to find the Rolling Start one,

23:57.000 --> 24:00.000
because that's the one that I still hear in my sleep.

24:01.000 --> 24:03.000
How can you not like this song?

24:03.000 --> 24:05.000
It's totally not repetitive.

24:05.000 --> 24:07.000
Because I have something called taste.

24:08.000 --> 24:11.000
This almost sounds like it could be like an 80s cartoon theme, you know?

24:11.000 --> 24:12.000
That'd be awesome.

24:18.000 --> 24:21.000
Someone should totally make that as their cell phone ringtone, that'd be awesome.

24:21.000 --> 24:24.000
I'm gonna make that the ringtone for whenever Jamie calls on my phone.

24:26.000 --> 24:29.000
Hey, I've already made a bunch of iPhone ringtones now.

24:29.000 --> 24:34.000
I made the Burning Rangers one, and that's about as far as I'll go into the realm of Sega.

24:34.000 --> 24:36.000
Hey, Jamie, I've got a joke for you.

24:37.000 --> 24:38.000
It's gonna end...

24:38.000 --> 24:42.000
The joke is gonna be when I kick your ass so hard your teeth will feel my foot.

24:42.000 --> 24:43.000
Dark Sakura.

24:44.000 --> 24:45.000
Knock knock.

24:46.000 --> 24:47.000
What?

24:53.000 --> 24:54.000
What?

24:54.000 --> 24:56.000
What?

24:57.000 --> 24:58.000
Shut up.

24:59.000 --> 25:01.000
I will play it again. I will fucking play it again.

25:01.000 --> 25:03.000
I will kick you in the face.

25:05.000 --> 25:06.000
You know what your ringtone is on my phone, by the way?

25:06.000 --> 25:07.000
What?

25:09.000 --> 25:11.000
I wanna guess. Is it?

25:15.000 --> 25:16.000
No? No?

25:20.000 --> 25:22.000
Just let me borrow that phone.

25:22.000 --> 25:23.000
So I gave you something more annoying.

25:23.000 --> 25:24.000
Alright.

25:24.000 --> 25:27.000
I don't know what it is with this show tonight. I'm just...

25:28.000 --> 25:29.000
It's called Jamie Has a Headache.

25:29.000 --> 25:30.000
I feel sorry.

25:30.000 --> 25:32.000
Oh, and Tigerclaw linked the rolling start, by the way.

25:32.000 --> 25:33.000
Awesome.

25:34.000 --> 25:37.000
That one, actually, I do like that one okay.

25:37.000 --> 25:38.000
Just cause I think it's kinda neat.

25:38.000 --> 25:40.000
I realize this game is like years and years old.

25:43.000 --> 25:45.000
This is the worst soundtrack in history.

25:45.000 --> 25:47.000
I love this soundtrack. What are you talking about?

25:47.000 --> 25:52.000
It's more of a song you need to play the game to.

25:56.000 --> 25:58.000
I actually like this music.

26:03.000 --> 26:07.000
Xlinc in chat says, I'll fly over there and both of them in the face.

26:07.000 --> 26:10.000
Except he left out, like, there's a word missing there, I think.

26:10.000 --> 26:11.000
So...

26:12.000 --> 26:14.000
You know what you can do in the face?

26:14.000 --> 26:16.000
Do, do, do, do, do, do-do-d Features

26:15.000 --> 26:18.000
Rob, you need to cleanse the pallet.

26:20.000 --> 26:21.000
Let's move on.

26:21.000 --> 26:23.000
Copy, save us.

26:23.000 --> 26:27.000
Let's get into some release dates, perhaps that will end the Daytona chat.

26:27.000 --> 26:28.000
Never. It will never end that chat.

26:28.000 --> 26:35.000
So coming out of this week is actually a pretty good line up of stuff.

26:35.000 --> 26:40.000
Starting off we've got Borderlands, which is making its way out

26:40.000 --> 26:49.720
Xbox 360. Did Rob mess up? No, just go ahead. I totally like skipped like three

26:49.720 --> 26:52.880
stories in the show, but that's okay. Just do release dates now, we'll go back to it.

26:52.880 --> 27:02.240
Alright, anyways. Stop messing with my head, Rob! I got too distracted by Daytona, I'm sorry. But it's

27:02.240 --> 27:08.440
good music to think too. Alright, so yeah, as I said, Borderlands coming out this

27:08.440 --> 27:13.040
week. PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, pretty awesome looking, so definitely check that

27:13.040 --> 27:26.680
out. If you're into the football, or soccer as we call it in the US, FIFA Soccer 2010 will be coming out on DS, PSP, Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, PlayStation 2, and Wii.

27:26.680 --> 27:33.760
Smackdown vs. Brawl 2010 also coming out this week on pretty much everything.

27:33.760 --> 27:46.360
Space Invaders Extreme 2 making its way out on DS, finally. It looks like the Wii version of NBA 2K10 was delayed to this week, so that'll be coming out as well.

27:46.360 --> 27:52.640
Jillian Michaels Fitness Ultimatum 2010 on DS. Yippee, I know, I'm excited.

27:52.640 --> 28:02.560
Madagascar Carts on the Wii, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360, DS, and PSP. And then with the Wii, of course, they also have a version with

28:02.560 --> 28:10.640
a wheel, because god damn it, no one can pretend that the Wii remote is a steering wheel without a plastic piece of crap that's got attached to it.

28:10.640 --> 28:17.240
Marvel Superhero Squad coming out on PlayStation 2, Wii, and DS. If you like your

28:17.240 --> 28:25.520
Marvel Ultimate Alliance Super Chibi. Tropico 3 coming out on PC. Charm Girls Club,

28:25.520 --> 28:35.160
Perfect Prom coming out on DS. And yes, EA has a lot more to go with that as well. They have a few other Charm Girls games.

28:35.160 --> 28:42.760
Charm Girls Club Pajama Party on the Wii. Ooh, exciting. Charm Girls Club Fashion Mall on DS.

28:42.760 --> 28:54.800
And there was something with the prom, I know. Oh, Fashion Show, yes. And to go along with that, if you're not in the Charm Girls Club, maybe

28:54.800 --> 29:03.800
Littlest Pet Shop, because they're whoring that out this week as well. Littlest Pet Shop City Friends on DS this week. Littlest Pet Shop Friends on the Wii.

29:03.800 --> 29:14.400
Littlest Pet Shop Country Friends on DS. And I'm sure there's one other one, but I don't really care. What a bunch of crap. Yes, exactly.

29:14.400 --> 29:30.240
It's not coming out this week, but Cookie Mama 3 and Shop and Chop is coming out on DS. Oh, there's a game for Jamie. You know, it'd be better if it was Cookie Mama 3

29:30.240 --> 29:40.880
Chop Shop, but you know, opportunity missed. Just in time for Halloween, too. Cookie Mama goes insane. You know, I have to tell you guys something. Before the show tonight,

29:40.880 --> 29:48.120
Dark Soccer, you know, we were all running late tonight. If the show seems off tonight, it is. Dark Soccer, I think, is getting sick, which means

29:48.120 --> 29:57.800
Loki and I are going to be sick. I've had the plague. Great. Cool, I get to play DJ Hero. Loki is not cool for me. I've got so much crap going on at work.

29:57.800 --> 30:06.600
Loki got here like five minutes before the show started tonight, and it was going to get chicken. And I overslept, so I got here way later than I usually do.

30:06.600 --> 30:15.880
If Bobby was going to do a call tonight, we would have been screwed. We would have been ready. But here's the thing. Dark Soccer, she runs in here like a couple of minutes

30:15.880 --> 30:26.760
before the show starts, and she goes, dude, I've got these grapes that are like eyeballs. They're so big. They are. They're the size of eyeballs. They're meat and grapes.

30:26.760 --> 30:35.400
Well, is your mic on? No, I turned it off because you said I was typing too loud. That's right. Well, so you had these grapes that were the size of eyeballs, and it made me

30:35.400 --> 30:43.480
think how, like, you remember when you'd go to those haunted houses when you were younger? They'd put frozen grapes in a bowl and tell you it was a bowl full of eyeballs?

30:43.480 --> 30:51.360
Yeah. It just made me think of that. And then you mentioned Cooking Mama, and I think it's just in time for Halloween. What if Cooking Mama went crazy and it was a game like

30:51.360 --> 30:59.720
Splatterhouse? That would be amazing. Or as actdeft in chat says, Cooking Mama, chop till you drop. A game like Splatterhouse? You mean delayed indefinitely? Okay, how about

30:59.720 --> 31:23.720
Cooking Mama meets Dead Rising? That could work. Cooking Mama, Zombie Edition. Don't worry, Mama will braise. Ah, Cooking Mama as the cleaner. Don't worry, Mama will fix it. Or as darktids3 in chat says, Cooking Mama, rolling star.

31:23.720 --> 31:33.720
Oh, that's going to be the joke all night. Other games coming out this week. Astro Boy, tying in with the new animated movie, coming out on Wii, PlayStation 2, DS, and PSP.

31:33.720 --> 31:56.720
Secret Saturdays, Beasts of the Fifth Sun, coming out on Wii, PlayStation 2, DS. My Tran Wars on PSP. iCarly on DS and Wii. God, it's just pitiful. Mountain Sports on the Wii, yet another winter themed sports minigame collection.

31:56.720 --> 32:16.720
Imagine Fashion Designer World Tour on DS. Crap, crap, and more crap. Is there anything interesting? Bakugan on PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Wii, and DS. And I'm sure there's something I'm missing here. Good stuff.

32:16.720 --> 32:26.720
Good stuff. Alien Monster Bowling League? No, no, that's not good. It's on the Wii. No, Your Mom the Game, I'm Sorry, is not coming out this week. It's too bad.

32:26.720 --> 32:40.720
She got delayed. She got delayed, yes. Lips, number one hit on Xbox 360? No? If it doesn't have that Rolling Start song, I don't want it.

32:40.720 --> 32:58.720
Maybe it does. The worst title for a game, but they had to do it. Diner Dash, Flow on the Go, for DS. No, that's wrong. So wrong. The joke's right itself, I don't have to say anything.

32:58.720 --> 33:11.720
Medieval Games on the Wii for all your Ren Faire fans. Grand Theft Auto Chinatown Wars coming to the PSP this week, which looks pretty cool. Dragon Ball Revenge of King Piccolo on the Wii. Lots of stuff this week.

33:11.720 --> 33:32.720
Motorstorm Arctic Edge finally coming out on PlayStation 2, and Nostalgia on DS. That actually looks pretty sweet. Star Wars The Force Unleashed Ultimate Sith Edition on PC. And finally, World of the Zoo on the Wii.

33:32.720 --> 33:46.720
Finally. Let's see, I wanted to actually read something from chat here that was from Psycoon saying, Orange Lounge is one big tangent today. Yes, it is. And I'm going to start another one here.

33:46.720 --> 33:54.720
Because speaking of release dates, going to last week's releases, we had a huge game come out this week that nobody mentioned during their gaming weeks. Uncharted 2.

33:54.720 --> 34:10.720
I, anywhere I look, I can't stop hearing about this game and how fucking amazing it's supposed to be. Like, you know, now keep in mind, I don't usually play a lot of the platformy Tomb Raider type of games, which I hear Uncharted 2 kind of is.

34:10.720 --> 34:26.720
So I haven't really been paying attention. But now, as I will hear about how awesome this game is non-stop and how people are already calling it Game of the Year, I kind of feel like I need to play it. So I got to turn to Loki, who's talked about this game a little more on the show than I have.

34:26.720 --> 34:33.720
What have you heard about this game? You didn't mention it either, but I seriously have not heard a single thing bad about it. Like, not one.

34:33.720 --> 34:40.720
I don't know. It got good reviews. I'm not buying it.

34:40.720 --> 34:41.720
Why not?

34:41.720 --> 34:43.720
Because I don't want to buy it.

34:43.720 --> 34:46.720
Is it one of those things where it's like, oh well, you're too cool for schools?

34:46.720 --> 34:56.720
No, no, no. It's not even that. It's an action game. Not even so much like Tomb Raider. I mean, the comparisons of the first game were kind of like, oh, it's Tomb Raider the guy.

34:56.720 --> 35:07.720
Not so much now. I mean, it's more of just an action game. It's a very cinematic action game. I just don't have time for it. And yeah, I can see why they're calling it Game of the Year. It's practically the only game coming from Sony this fall.

35:07.720 --> 35:21.720
So it is the Game of the Year. I mean, they did have games in the spring, but for argument's sake, we're going to ignore those. But I don't know. It's good. I mean, don't get me wrong. Game of the Year? Probably not.

35:21.720 --> 35:31.720
Kind of some polarizing stuff in chat. Psycoon says, if I got a free copy, I would totally play it. That's a good point. Games are 60 bucks. But again, I haven't heard a negative thing about this game. It's probably worth it.

35:31.720 --> 35:41.720
And HungryMrKrunk says, why aren't you going to buy it? What? Seriously? What? Daytona?

35:41.720 --> 35:53.720
I mean, there are a lot of people that probably think you're crazy for what you just said. I at least want to rent it and see if I like it and get us into it as everyone else does. So I apologize I didn't play it for this week.

35:53.720 --> 35:58.720
I'm not buying Modern Warfare 2 either. Ooh, I'm crazy.

35:58.720 --> 36:03.720
And GameGuru says, Game of the Year for Sony fanboy maybes. Ooh, yikes.

36:03.720 --> 36:17.720
Don't get me wrong. It is probably going to be the best Playstation 3 game other than Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 that comes out this year. But that's about it. Best Sony made game this year? Yes.

36:17.720 --> 36:35.720
I'll probably play it at some point. I can never resist peer pressure. Okay, anyway, back to release dates. Sorry. Going to Japan and looking at the Japanese release dates. FIFA Soccer 10 World Class Soccer comes out in Japan as well as Forza Motorsport 3 gets its run in Japan. Those both coming out on the 22nd of October.

36:35.720 --> 36:50.720
Moving on over to, of course, the Playstation 3. FIFA Soccer 10 also comes out over there. That's really the only major release in Japan this week on the PS3. And moving on over to the Nintendo Wii, another port of FIFA 10 World Class Soccer.

36:50.720 --> 37:08.720
There's some other games there as well, including Sukiban Satcho Reina Wii comes out on the Wii. And I like this because the box art is like this hot pink box art. And it's just kittens all over it. And it looks like it's like a lolcat game. Like I'm not even kidding.

37:08.720 --> 37:24.720
Oh my god. I shit you not. It's Keyboard Cat. There's a scene with a cat playing the piano. It's Keyboard Cat and Lolcat like in a game for the Wii. That is Game of the Year right there. I'm sorry. Fuck Uncharted. Fuck it. This is the Game of the Year right here.

37:24.720 --> 37:49.720
Why don't they release this crap over here? D3, come on. If there is a game that you need to localize for the US, it is this game. They're dancing with kittens and oh my god is that cat shooting a laser. Oh my god. This is it right here. Again, I'm going to say this name again.

37:49.720 --> 38:10.720
I'm going to order that game. It is Sukiban Satcho Reina Wii. Question for you Rob. And this sort of ties in with that. Why don't we move back to the old studio again? I don't know. Because we should. Why? Because I'll get that game and then we can do it on Justin TV. Oh maybe at some point.

38:10.720 --> 38:26.720
I can get that set up here. We just need the camera. I can get the camera. That's easy. We can do it in the vault. We'll figure it out. But anyhow, the chat was demanding to check out that game in the chat rooms. I posted a link in chat. I apologize to those on the podcast because I can't link it to you.

38:26.720 --> 38:47.720
But again, that's S-U-K-E-B-A-N. Sukiban. S-H-A-C-H-O-U. Satcho. Reina. R-E-N-A. Wii. That's the name of the game. And it's cats, cats and more cats. It's an action game. So I mean seriously, how can you say Uncharted 2 is the game of the year when you have this game coming out on the Wii?

38:47.720 --> 38:56.720
I just don't. I think it's clearly. That was a statement said without considering the rest of the year.

38:56.720 --> 39:02.720
Wow. I'm actually looking up reviews on it. To make sure it's lolcats the game.

39:02.720 --> 39:05.720
Let us know what you find.

39:05.720 --> 39:22.720
Ok well I still have to do. Well hold on, hold on. I got some more releases here. PlayStation 2. Beatmania 2DX 16 Empress is making its way out right now. I think it was out a little early for some people. I think it just came out in Japan this past week.

39:22.720 --> 39:32.720
But some of your import stores will finally have it in stock this week. They know that this is one of the big games people like to import. And it's a huge release obviously being the last 2DX game on PlayStation 2. So look for that.

39:32.720 --> 39:41.720
On the Nintendo DS Element Hunters comes out in Japan this week as well as Rune Factory 3. And a game called Roller Angels. Check that out.

39:41.720 --> 39:53.720
And then lastly on the Sony PSP. Again these are Japanese release dates. Another release of FIFA Soccer 10. Obviously soccer is very big in countries that aren't the US.

39:53.720 --> 40:13.720
And a game called Haru Kanaru Toki no Naka Day 3 Unme no Meikyu Aizu Ban or Treasure Box. And I've learned to look up these games and make sure they aren't like more cat games. Because they might have a weird title but it might be awesome.

40:13.720 --> 40:22.720
But this is actually a role playing game and it's a romance simulation game. But it has to do with historical characters. Yes that's right I said romance game with historical characters.

40:22.720 --> 40:30.720
I love how this cat game is so realistic because they have a mini dancing game where the guy is dancing around and the cat is just like I don't care.

40:30.720 --> 40:42.720
I'm looking at the website for the game which sadly because it's all image files I can't read but like half of it. So it looks like it's a cat raising sim. Do they have a Twitter? They freaking have a Twitter.

40:42.720 --> 40:45.720
But it's all in Japanese right? I'm gonna follow the Japanese Twitter.

40:45.720 --> 40:59.720
Alright you do that. Actdeft in chat says now the folks in chat are kind of looking at what we just posted. Leo Shen says I got my copy. Oh he might have been talking about Beatmania because I just mentioned that.

40:59.720 --> 41:03.720
Actdeft says best Wii game ever. Not even Epic Mickey will surpass this game.

41:03.720 --> 41:10.720
Okay I found the description from the Twitter so I'm running it through the Nifty translator. And we'll see what it says.

41:10.720 --> 41:12.720
Alright let me know what happens.

41:12.720 --> 41:24.720
Okay. Cat president and choking employee recruitment on large scale. Famous cat Rena of the Superman nature blog finally appears in the game. Let's work also by you under the cat president.

41:24.720 --> 41:26.720
What the hell does that mean?

41:26.720 --> 41:28.720
Because it's translating.

41:28.720 --> 41:30.720
That doesn't even fucking make sense. I love it.

41:30.720 --> 41:46.720
So is the president of cats or something? I guess this cat Rena is a famous cat. I've actually heard of the cat before. I'm getting this game. Fuck it. I'm getting it.

41:46.720 --> 41:51.720
Rob let's get the communal OLR copy and find a Wii that we can play it on.

41:51.720 --> 41:53.720
Amazing. Loki has one right?

41:53.720 --> 41:57.720
I have a Wii that I'll play it on. We'll have this game. Don't worry. It'll be coming.

41:57.720 --> 42:08.720
Actually this was just sent to me in chat is that we actually have an exclusive sneak peek at the soundtrack for this game. It's amazing.

42:08.720 --> 42:12.720
That sounds so familiar.

42:12.720 --> 42:19.720
Okay the next one you're going to hear is my microphone connecting with the back of Rob's head. Ready? One, two.

42:19.720 --> 42:23.720
Ow!

42:23.720 --> 42:31.720
Anyhow, President Cat.

42:31.720 --> 42:37.720
Seriously every other podcast you listen to, every single one of them will mention Uncharted 2 this week.

42:37.720 --> 42:43.720
And they will suck its dick to no end. What other show are you going to hear about this game on?

42:43.720 --> 42:46.720
I challenge you. What other show?

42:46.720 --> 42:51.720
Watch there's probably at least five other shows that mention it. But seriously.

42:51.720 --> 42:53.720
There's a reason we're different.

42:53.720 --> 42:54.720
I'm picking a random tweet.

42:54.720 --> 42:56.720
Alright fine. But then you gotta get into UK releases.

42:56.720 --> 43:02.720
Okay this is just hilarious. And I love also listing stuff through the nifty translator.

43:02.720 --> 43:04.720
Okay.

43:04.720 --> 43:10.720
Oh never mind. Just talking about a grade schooler following their Wii. Their Twitter.

43:10.720 --> 43:15.720
Yeah if anyone who can read Japanese wants to follow their Twitter it's Renawii.

43:15.720 --> 43:19.720
Someone go start translating that for me right now.

43:19.720 --> 43:21.720
Ooh I just forgot. I can run the whole thing through.

43:21.720 --> 43:24.720
You need to like tweet to them you know. Quoting them or something.

43:24.720 --> 43:28.720
Yeah just tweet to them and say release your game in English please.

43:28.720 --> 43:29.720
Best game ever.

43:29.720 --> 43:31.720
No I'm going to go on the OLR Twitter right now and tweet to them.

43:31.720 --> 43:34.720
Actually I'm running their Twitter through Nifty.

43:34.720 --> 43:41.720
I love. Anyone if you want one of the best translators from Japanese to English.

43:41.720 --> 43:45.720
Seriously. Just look up Nifty Global Gate.

43:45.720 --> 43:51.720
So yeah. Say they keep calling it President Rina.

43:51.720 --> 43:57.720
Okay. I'm going to tweet them right now from the OLR account. Can you send me the link to their Twitter in chat?

43:57.720 --> 43:58.720
Yeah.

43:58.720 --> 44:02.720
And then can we do the UK releases? Sorry I know you're like trying to do five things at once but.

44:02.720 --> 44:04.720
Where's IRC? There it is.

44:04.720 --> 44:12.720
Alright. So she's going to get me the Twitter there and I'm going to tweet them from the OLR account saying we demand that you release this game in English.

44:12.720 --> 44:14.720
I'm linking it to the main chat room too because I want everyone.

44:14.720 --> 44:16.720
Alright. Sweet. I'm going to go tweet them right now.

44:16.720 --> 44:26.720
We want this game. We want President Kat. Sacho means Kat. President by the way. Rob. Sacho means President.

44:26.720 --> 44:32.720
Gotcha. Well now I learned a little Japanese today. Alright. Let's do UK releases.

44:32.720 --> 44:37.720
Okay. To end this stuff on the 23rd we have Borderlands. We have CSI Deadly Intent.

44:37.720 --> 44:45.720
Fairy Tail Fights. Forza Motorsport 3. Ghostbusters on PSP. Grand Theft Auto Chinatown Wars on PSP.

44:45.720 --> 44:54.720
Lips number one hits. What the fuck ever. Marvel Superhero Squad. Nintendo Presents Style Boutique. Ew.

44:54.720 --> 45:03.720
Pro Evolution Soccer 2010. WWE Smackdown vs Raw 2010. And that's it.

45:03.720 --> 45:04.720
Alright.

45:04.720 --> 45:06.720
And President Kat!

45:06.720 --> 45:08.720
No. Not in the. Here's what I'm saying to them.

45:08.720 --> 45:10.720
I'm making an icon of President Kat.

45:10.720 --> 45:14.720
We are talking about your game on our show right now and we demand you release it in English in the US.

45:14.720 --> 45:17.720
President Kat for USA.

45:17.720 --> 45:26.720
Alright. In fact. Please retweet the fuck out of this please. Thank you. I'm going to post it shortly.

45:26.720 --> 45:28.720
Okay.

45:28.720 --> 45:35.720
Also if any of our listeners that speak Japanese please retweet it to them in Japanese. Thank you.

45:35.720 --> 45:40.720
This needs to happen. Alright. Anyway. There's probably some people listening to this show right now like.

45:40.720 --> 45:41.720
Release date.

45:41.720 --> 45:42.720
What are they smoking tonight?

45:42.720 --> 45:47.720
10-22. Countdown will deliver a picture of their cute and funny friend, Rina.

45:47.720 --> 45:52.720
Is a marijuana farm burning in Sacramento tonight? I mean seriously. What is going on?

45:52.720 --> 45:56.720
SSJ100 Matt says Shermie is secretary of Katnipp.

45:56.720 --> 45:58.720
Dude I love this Kat.

45:58.720 --> 46:04.720
Alright. Moving on there's other video gaming stories. Believe it or not. Other than President Kat we will keep you posted.

46:04.720 --> 46:11.720
Please again. Please please please retweet our message to Rina Wee. We want them to notice. Please.

46:11.720 --> 46:12.720
Okay.

46:12.720 --> 46:14.720
We want President Kat.

46:14.720 --> 46:22.720
Alright. In other news that's not President Kat related and unfortunately makes it less important is Blaze.

46:22.720 --> 46:27.720
Which is a company that makes third party peripherals for game systems like the Wii and the PlayStation 3.

46:27.720 --> 46:37.720
Well they have now put out a brand new motion 3D controller that looks exactly like a Wii remote.

46:37.720 --> 46:40.720
So much so I wouldn't be surprised if they get sued for it.

46:40.720 --> 46:46.720
But. Hey whatever. It says it works fine at Sega Tennis and Tiger Woods.

46:46.720 --> 46:50.720
But it looks exactly like a Wii remote.

46:50.720 --> 46:54.720
Good luck with your lawsuit.

46:54.720 --> 47:07.720
However. There's always a however. However. It will not work with President Kat because President Kat is coming out on the Wii and not the PlayStation 3.

47:07.720 --> 47:08.720
Anyway.

47:08.720 --> 47:15.720
I'm also making a call by the way for making President Kat be a trending topic.

47:15.720 --> 47:25.720
I hope it works. Alright. Here's the thing. Why are they doing this when the PlayStation 3 is doing their own?

47:25.720 --> 47:28.720
And how are they possibly getting away with it without Sony bringing the smack down?

47:28.720 --> 47:32.720
I mean doesn't this kind of thing have to have some type of Sony license anyway?

47:32.720 --> 47:35.720
Especially considering the fact that it works with existing games?

47:35.720 --> 47:45.720
Maybe. I don't know how they're doing it. But it'll be something that's not very useful.

47:45.720 --> 47:51.720
Probably won't sell that much. Especially when the Cosmic Ice Cream Cones come out.

47:51.720 --> 47:58.720
But for right now. Hey if you want to buy this to use in your two games that it supports.

47:58.720 --> 48:01.720
More power to you I guess.

48:01.720 --> 48:05.720
I don't even really know how it'd work because it doesn't look like it has analog sticks on it.

48:05.720 --> 48:09.720
I mean maybe that little grey circle is supposed to be an analog stick.

48:09.720 --> 48:13.720
But I mean it looks like it's missing most of the buttons on there.

48:13.720 --> 48:19.720
So I don't know. I'm confused.

48:19.720 --> 48:25.720
It just looks like a cheap knockoff. Which I'm sure it is. But I still don't understand the legal end of it.

48:25.720 --> 48:29.720
Like how they can possibly get away with it and how Sony is letting it happen.

48:29.720 --> 48:31.720
I guess it looks different enough than the Wii Remote.

48:31.720 --> 48:35.720
But it's basically got the trigger underneath where the B button would normally be.

48:35.720 --> 48:39.720
It's got the directional pad at the top just like the Wii Remote.

48:39.720 --> 48:43.720
Instead of just the 1 and 2 button at the bottom like the Wii Remote.

48:43.720 --> 48:47.720
It has the 4 buttons that are normally on the face of the controller.

48:47.720 --> 48:51.720
In the middle it's got 3 other buttons which I can't really read what they say.

48:51.720 --> 48:55.720
I think it's Start, Select, and maybe the PlayStation button.

48:55.720 --> 49:01.720
And then 3 more buttons kind of in the middle there which I have no idea what those do either.

49:01.720 --> 49:07.720
But whatever. Like I said, if you really want to buy it then check it out I guess.

49:07.720 --> 49:13.720
But it looks like cheap knockoff crap and you'd better just wait for the real thing.

49:13.720 --> 49:19.720
It's tough when you're making this controller that really serves somewhat of a purpose but it's not that important.

49:19.720 --> 49:27.720
It's not anything like the Frag FX or something like that where you're actually making something that you use a mouse to aim or something like that.

49:27.720 --> 49:29.720
So it's more like PC.

49:29.720 --> 49:42.720
But this, I guess it's more immersive for Tiger Woods but I'd really just wait for the official motion controller from Sony because it'll probably be even better.

49:42.720 --> 49:48.720
And what's the point in dropping money now for something that's not very good when you can just wait a few more months and the official thing comes out.

49:48.720 --> 49:50.720
I don't know.

49:50.720 --> 49:55.720
Alright. Moving on to something that's so interesting.

49:55.720 --> 49:57.720
I don't even know how to define this here.

49:57.720 --> 49:59.720
This is a complete 180. A different type of story here.

49:59.720 --> 50:01.720
But it has to do with Phantasy Star Portable 2.

50:01.720 --> 50:04.720
Which, you know, we've been talking about Sega and crazy things from Japan tonight.

50:04.720 --> 50:06.720
This is right up the alley of these types of stories.

50:06.720 --> 50:14.720
Phantasy Star Portable 2 is going to be getting some product placement and it's kind of extreme.

50:14.720 --> 50:22.720
First off, there's going to be Fanta products in the game like the drink, you know, Wanna Fanta, that whole thing are going to be showing up in Phantasy Star Portable 2.

50:22.720 --> 50:23.720
They're still around.

50:23.720 --> 50:27.720
Well, you're talking about the official drink of Germany during World War 2.

50:27.720 --> 50:28.720
I guess.

50:28.720 --> 50:34.720
But then also, something to note is that Pizza Hut branding is now going to show up in the game.

50:34.720 --> 50:43.720
Apparently, you're actually going to be able to have like pizza related shields and swords and things of that note.

50:43.720 --> 50:51.720
And I'm looking at the site that is running the story here, andreasang.com.

50:51.720 --> 50:55.720
And they actually have screenshots of this chick and it doesn't look photoshopped.

50:55.720 --> 50:56.720
Like, I think this is the real deal.

50:56.720 --> 50:57.720
Oh, that's the real deal.

50:57.720 --> 51:01.720
A little Pizza Hut box and a pizza pan.

51:01.720 --> 51:04.720
Yes, you will actually be able to get like Pizza 2.

51:04.720 --> 51:12.720
Seafood mixed pizza for 2500 Meseta and cheese and cheese pizza for 1900 Meseta will actually be available in the game.

51:12.720 --> 51:16.720
There's a little like pizza place in the game and so forth.

51:16.720 --> 51:20.720
So, I mean, I just don't really like get it.

51:20.720 --> 51:24.720
Like, A, that sword and shield is god awful ugly.

51:24.720 --> 51:29.720
But, I mean, what does pizza have to do with Phantasy Star?

51:29.720 --> 51:34.720
I mean, I guess it's like product placement, just like you see in the billboards and the racing games here in the US.

51:34.720 --> 51:36.720
But it's a little extreme, don't you think?

51:36.720 --> 51:41.720
Well, keep in mind, Sega had a whole game based around Pepsi.

51:41.720 --> 51:44.720
This isn't Farfetch'd.

51:44.720 --> 51:45.720
I guess.

51:45.720 --> 51:49.720
Pepsiman, Rob! They need Pepsiman versus Pizza Hut.

51:49.720 --> 51:52.720
You can't help but go, okay, this is a little bit much.

51:52.720 --> 51:56.720
Like, it's one thing in Crazy Taxi to have the KFC and Pizza Hut that you have to drop people off.

51:56.720 --> 51:59.720
Doesn't Pepsi Cola own Pizza Hut?

51:59.720 --> 52:01.720
I think so, yeah.

52:01.720 --> 52:03.720
Is Pepsi gonna buy Sega? Is that where we're going?

52:03.720 --> 52:06.720
Maybe that's just what's gonna happen, I don't know.

52:06.720 --> 52:12.720
Tigerclaw in chat says, I remember seeing Pizza Hut billboards in TMNT 2, the arcade on the NES.

52:12.720 --> 52:16.720
Yeah, it's not that, like, product placement in video games is anything new, although, you know, I don't know how-

52:16.720 --> 52:17.720
It was Domino's in the movie.

52:17.720 --> 52:19.720
I don't know if it's often talked about.

52:19.720 --> 52:25.720
But, I mean, when it gets, like, in your face so much as, like, you're carrying around a giant Pizza Hut box,

52:25.720 --> 52:29.720
and, I guess, hitting monsters with it or blocking their attacks with it,

52:29.720 --> 52:35.720
I mean, it kind of starts to cross the line of WTF, LOL.

52:35.720 --> 52:41.720
Deathwishing says, the acceptable games with product placement are sports and racing games unless they're futuristic,

52:41.720 --> 52:44.720
but if it's a shooter or RPG, no, no.

52:44.720 --> 52:49.720
And it's not cheeseball enough to where, you know, they really could be over the top with everything, like,

52:49.720 --> 52:56.720
you know, have product placement everywhere and just, like, ridiculous weapons based on, you know,

52:56.720 --> 53:01.720
you know, the golden arches or something, you know, that'd be kind of funny.

53:01.720 --> 53:03.720
Crazy, crazy.

53:03.720 --> 53:06.720
By the way, thank you so much to the people that are retweeting our message.

53:06.720 --> 53:10.720
We have almost, like, a full page of tweets there of people retweeting our message.

53:10.720 --> 53:13.720
They've got to see it. You know they're going to see it.

53:13.720 --> 53:19.720
I've actually tried to translate a little bit more of it, so I think I've got the general story of the game.

53:19.720 --> 53:20.720
Yeah.

53:20.720 --> 53:29.720
So, you play as the cat, and you are part of a trio called Let's Going 3, so I'm guessing it'd be Ikimas 3, I guess.

53:29.720 --> 53:35.720
And they are a very, very popular trio of cats.

53:35.720 --> 53:46.720
And so, Rina, who is the editor-in-chief of production of a company, I guess, that puts out Shogakuken,

53:46.720 --> 53:51.720
which is, like, a shoujo manga book, I guess.

53:51.720 --> 53:55.720
This is just what I'm getting from the translation and from what little I can read.

53:55.720 --> 54:04.720
But basically, the whole point is you're trying to get Rina and the staff to try to publish, I guess, the magazine

54:04.720 --> 54:06.720
and try to do all this other stuff.

54:06.720 --> 54:09.720
You have a minigame where you play the piano, and you have exercises,

54:09.720 --> 54:13.720
but the whole point of it is to become president of the company.

54:13.720 --> 54:15.720
Oh, and you have cosplay.

54:15.720 --> 54:16.720
A cat?

54:16.720 --> 54:17.720
You have kitty cosplay.

54:17.720 --> 54:20.720
A cat that publishes an anime magazine?

54:20.720 --> 54:21.720
No.

54:21.720 --> 54:23.720
Mongo, whatever.

54:23.720 --> 54:27.720
That's fucking awesome.

54:27.720 --> 54:30.720
You have sixteen different kinds of cosplay.

54:30.720 --> 54:32.720
I'm just giggling. This game is funny.

54:32.720 --> 54:35.720
This is... seriously, game of the year.

54:35.720 --> 54:37.720
This is gonna save the Wii.

54:37.720 --> 54:44.720
I mean, because this is kind of like... the Wii is kind of a preposterous system to begin with.

54:44.720 --> 54:46.720
This game just is right at home.

54:46.720 --> 54:50.720
The Wii needs more games that are just OMG, WTF like this.

54:50.720 --> 54:51.720
Amazing.

54:51.720 --> 54:55.720
An Amazon JP is selling it for 4,410 yen.

54:55.720 --> 54:58.720
When does it come out? Oh no, duh, I just read it during Japanese releases.

54:58.720 --> 54:59.720
It's out this week.

54:59.720 --> 55:00.720
Yeah, this week.

55:00.720 --> 55:02.720
Someone buy me this.

55:02.720 --> 55:06.720
Seriously, this is the type of random crap I would buy on Dreamcast.

55:06.720 --> 55:09.720
Like, okay, I bought Super Producers.

55:09.720 --> 55:12.720
If that game isn't random, I don't know what is.

55:12.720 --> 55:16.720
Or like, what was it, the Roommate 202 or something?

55:16.720 --> 55:17.720
Oh, I remember that one.

55:17.720 --> 55:18.720
Or 232?

55:18.720 --> 55:19.720
Yeah. Oh my god.

55:19.720 --> 55:22.720
This is along the same... the Wii is the new Dreamcast.

55:22.720 --> 55:24.720
Rob, the Wii is the Dreamcast.

55:24.720 --> 55:28.720
Except, the Wii is actually selling a lot to soccer moms across America.

55:28.720 --> 55:30.720
Alright, anyhow, let's move on with more stories.

55:30.720 --> 55:32.720
DarkSakura, you're up.

55:32.720 --> 55:37.720
I hate to make President Cat take over this whole show, but it's fucking fascinating.

55:37.720 --> 55:39.720
I think it's fantastic.

55:39.720 --> 55:44.720
Okay, so Microsoft seems to think that the PS3 is screwed this year.

55:44.720 --> 55:48.720
They think that the 360 will outsell the PS3.

55:48.720 --> 55:55.720
Aaron Greenberg, who is the big mouth of Microsoft,

55:55.720 --> 56:00.720
is saying that when NPD releases the September sales,

56:00.720 --> 56:06.720
they expect the PS3 is going to come in with the most units sold for the month

56:06.720 --> 56:10.720
because of the Slim release, but overall,

56:10.720 --> 56:15.720
that the Xbox 360 is still going to outsell for the calendar year

56:15.720 --> 56:17.720
and for the entire system generation.

56:17.720 --> 56:24.720
He compares it to a game of baseball where they may be ahead one inning,

56:24.720 --> 56:27.720
but it's what you get by the end of the game, that's what counts.

56:27.720 --> 56:32.720
So you may have won the battle, but you haven't won the war type of thing.

56:32.720 --> 56:33.720
Exactly.

56:33.720 --> 56:35.720
This is just one month.

56:35.720 --> 56:38.720
And I have to agree with the article, this is burn.

56:38.720 --> 56:40.720
He's quoted saying,

56:40.720 --> 56:44.720
Sony, for example, has publicly noted that they lose money on every console they sell,

56:44.720 --> 56:46.720
and with the price cut, they're now losing even more money.

56:46.720 --> 56:50.720
So even with the PS3 in the market today at $299,

56:50.720 --> 56:54.720
you have to question if their business model is sustainable.

56:54.720 --> 56:56.720
I don't know.

56:56.720 --> 56:59.720
You know, as much as I think, you know,

56:59.720 --> 57:04.720
and I do admit I've been kind of in the past, especially on this show,

57:04.720 --> 57:07.720
like really slanted towards 360.

57:07.720 --> 57:11.720
I think especially this year, I have come a long way towards,

57:11.720 --> 57:14.720
and I don't mean in reporting, I mean in, you know,

57:14.720 --> 57:16.720
just what I play myself and what I've enjoyed.

57:16.720 --> 57:19.720
I think this year especially, I think PS3 has gained a lot with me,

57:19.720 --> 57:22.720
and I think, you know, kind of going into this holiday season,

57:22.720 --> 57:25.720
I think the price drop was the best freaking thing they could do.

57:25.720 --> 57:28.720
Let me tell you a true story, totally true,

57:28.720 --> 57:32.720
is that the other night I was eating dinner with some co-workers,

57:32.720 --> 57:35.720
and the people at the table next to us,

57:35.720 --> 57:39.720
some like husbands and wives, about six of them,

57:39.720 --> 57:43.720
in their mid-20s, and they were talking about video games,

57:43.720 --> 57:47.720
and so I couldn't help but overhear because I'm a nosy motherfucker.

57:47.720 --> 57:51.720
So I actually heard them talking about the Xbox 360 and the PlayStation 3,

57:51.720 --> 57:54.720
and the guy was talking about how he's going to sell back his 360,

57:54.720 --> 57:57.720
and the one guy actually said, and it had nothing to do with the quality,

57:57.720 --> 57:59.720
I think they were talking financers or something,

57:59.720 --> 58:00.720
I don't know, I didn't hear everything.

58:00.720 --> 58:02.720
But the one guy said, well, you know, this holiday season,

58:02.720 --> 58:03.720
I kind of want to get a game system,

58:03.720 --> 58:08.720
but I think I want to get a PlayStation 3 because, dude, it has Blu-Ray.

58:08.720 --> 58:12.720
You know, and now that those systems are getting closer to the same price,

58:12.720 --> 58:15.720
you know, again, I don't think these guys were like hardcore gamers,

58:15.720 --> 58:17.720
but they are just average people.

58:17.720 --> 58:18.720
I overheard at a restaurant.

58:18.720 --> 58:22.720
I think that Blu-Ray this Christmas season is going to carry a lot of weight,

58:22.720 --> 58:24.720
and Microsoft's going to feel it.

58:24.720 --> 58:30.720
But you can get a better quality Blu-Ray player now for cheaper

58:30.720 --> 58:32.720
than the entire system costs.

58:32.720 --> 58:35.720
You could, for the cost of a good PS3 bundle,

58:35.720 --> 58:38.720
you could buy an Xbox 360 and a better Blu-Ray player.

58:38.720 --> 58:43.720
I get that, but what about that PlayStation 2 is a DVD player mentality

58:43.720 --> 58:45.720
that really helped out that system when it needed it?

58:45.720 --> 58:49.720
You know, you, me, the other gamers of America, we get that.

58:49.720 --> 58:52.720
But the people that are purchasing things en masse from Wal-Mart

58:52.720 --> 58:55.720
and Target to put under Christmas trees, are they going to get that?

58:55.720 --> 59:00.720
I still don't think that it's enough to save the system

59:00.720 --> 59:04.720
because, I mean, really, I would have to see hard numbers.

59:04.720 --> 59:06.720
I would have to look at their financial reports.

59:06.720 --> 59:10.720
I'd have to see what it costs to produce a system, what their marketing costs.

59:10.720 --> 59:15.720
Basically, I'd have to see overhead versus sales to get an idea to project.

59:15.720 --> 59:20.720
It seems to me that they would have to sell a hell of a lot to make up past losses

59:20.720 --> 59:26.720
and their current losses for overall system sales versus the overhead.

59:26.720 --> 59:27.720
Now, don't get me wrong.

59:27.720 --> 59:29.720
Can you tell I've been working in finance too long?

59:29.720 --> 59:30.720
Now, don't get me wrong.

59:30.720 --> 59:34.720
I'm not trying to say that I suddenly hate the 360.

59:34.720 --> 59:35.720
That's certainly not true.

59:35.720 --> 59:39.720
I think either way, Microsoft is going to definitely give them a run for their money,

59:39.720 --> 59:42.720
and they're probably, in the end, will still come out ahead.

59:42.720 --> 59:46.720
But I think if they were smart, what Microsoft would do is kind of go for the jugular.

59:46.720 --> 59:51.720
What's the biggest, for the mass population, asset of the PlayStation 3? Blu-ray.

59:51.720 --> 59:56.720
But what does the 360 have? Downloadable movies with Netflix specifically.

59:56.720 --> 01:00:00.720
I think if they start marketing a lot with that in their Netflix partnership,

01:00:00.720 --> 01:00:05.720
they are very likely to keep their head above water

01:00:05.720 --> 01:00:09.720
and not let Sony get them down too bad outside of just September.

01:00:09.720 --> 01:00:10.720
But we'll see.

01:00:10.720 --> 01:00:12.720
It's going to be a very interesting holiday season.

01:00:12.720 --> 01:00:13.720
I can't wait to see what happens.

01:00:13.720 --> 01:00:15.720
I know what would save the PS3, Rob.

01:00:15.720 --> 01:00:16.720
What?

01:00:16.720 --> 01:00:18.720
President Cat.

01:00:18.720 --> 01:00:21.720
Or how about Daytona?

01:00:21.720 --> 01:00:25.720
No, President Cat.

01:00:25.720 --> 01:00:26.720
Arena for President.

01:00:26.720 --> 01:00:30.720
Moving on. Loki, more video game news, please.

01:00:30.720 --> 01:00:32.720
That doesn't have to do with Cats.

01:00:32.720 --> 01:00:37.720
Well, one thing that Sony doesn't have, unfortunately, is the Ballad of Gay Tony.

01:00:37.720 --> 01:00:40.720
And that will be coming out, actually, next week.

01:00:40.720 --> 01:00:44.720
Well, the 29th, I guess, two weeks.

01:00:44.720 --> 01:00:52.720
They did release some new information regarding the multiplayer in the new episode for the 360.

01:00:52.720 --> 01:00:58.720
Some of the things that they get, new areas to have Deathmatch and Team Deathmatches,

01:00:58.720 --> 01:01:02.720
including some new and closed areas as well.

01:01:02.720 --> 01:01:08.720
Some that are actually in the clubs.

01:01:08.720 --> 01:01:13.720
Most of the Deathmatch maps that are out there right now for Grand Theft Auto

01:01:13.720 --> 01:01:15.720
were all just pretty much spots in the city.

01:01:15.720 --> 01:01:17.720
But these are actually in addition to that stuff.

01:01:17.720 --> 01:01:20.720
At least, I hope it's in addition to that and not just replacing it

01:01:20.720 --> 01:01:23.720
because that would really suck if they did replace it.

01:01:23.720 --> 01:01:25.720
But we'll see.

01:01:25.720 --> 01:01:31.720
Some other new things adding to Deathmatch other than just locations.

01:01:31.720 --> 01:01:37.720
They have killstreak bonuses, where if you kill 3 people, 5 people, or 10 people in a row,

01:01:37.720 --> 01:01:40.720
you get health and armor bonuses.

01:01:40.720 --> 01:01:46.720
And also, if someone kills you, breaking your streak, they will earn $125 instead of just $100.

01:01:46.720 --> 01:01:52.720
Also, for assists, where you do damage to somebody and someone else takes the kill for it,

01:01:52.720 --> 01:01:56.720
you also make $25 for that, whereas before you made nothing.

01:01:56.720 --> 01:02:01.720
And of course, they have new weapon classes to break things apart.

01:02:01.720 --> 01:02:06.720
They've got episodic, automatic, sniper rifles, explosives, and sticky bombs.

01:02:06.720 --> 01:02:08.720
I'm kind of interested about the episodic.

01:02:08.720 --> 01:02:11.720
Lol, gay Tony has sticky bombs.

01:02:11.720 --> 01:02:18.720
Hahaha. I'm interested to see if they actually, since it does have episodic,

01:02:18.720 --> 01:02:22.720
if it will include both the first and second episodes,

01:02:22.720 --> 01:02:26.720
which would be pretty awesome if they had some sort of cross-play with that.

01:02:26.720 --> 01:02:33.720
Free mode, they've added some new options, including the ability to use the parachutes in the game,

01:02:33.720 --> 01:02:38.720
and of course your tanks and the new buzzard attack helicopter, which is pretty awesome.

01:02:38.720 --> 01:02:46.720
And that's pretty much it for right now, but very excited about this new expansion coming out.

01:02:46.720 --> 01:02:50.720
Okay, so I have to admit, as somebody who doesn't really play a lot of Grand Theft Auto,

01:02:50.720 --> 01:02:53.720
a lot of that was blah blah blah to me, so you have to kind of translate.

01:02:53.720 --> 01:02:55.720
Is this going to be a good thing for the game?

01:02:55.720 --> 01:02:58.720
Yes, it's going to be awesome. It's going to basically enhance multiplayer a lot,

01:02:58.720 --> 01:03:03.720
and bring it to the over-the-topness of the other Grand Theft Auto games.

01:03:03.720 --> 01:03:06.720
Alright, and that's what people love about it, right?

01:03:06.720 --> 01:03:08.720
Yes, alright.

01:03:08.720 --> 01:03:15.720
Moving on, in other news, speaking of big multiplayer games, Left 4 Dead, as you know, there was a boycott.

01:03:15.720 --> 01:03:20.720
41,000 people had made this group on Steam, the Left 4 Dead 2 boycott group.

01:03:20.720 --> 01:03:24.720
Apparently, it has been brought to an end.

01:03:24.720 --> 01:03:28.720
And this has to do with one of the co-founders, Agent of Chaos.

01:03:28.720 --> 01:03:32.720
You might remember a couple weeks ago, we talked about how they actually got invited to Valve's headquarters and so forth,

01:03:32.720 --> 01:03:39.720
and we were kind of joking, oh, sold out and all this stuff, which certainly the community was accusing them of.

01:03:39.720 --> 01:03:44.720
But they said, quote, our goal wasn't to steer people away from Left 4 Dead 2,

01:03:44.720 --> 01:03:48.720
it was to get Valve's attention and have them support Left 4 Dead.

01:03:48.720 --> 01:03:55.720
So apparently, since they have continued to support Left 4 Dead with content, they have declared the boycott over.

01:03:55.720 --> 01:03:57.720
Hmm, interesting.

01:03:57.720 --> 01:03:59.720
But you know, the boycott was a little silly in the first place.

01:03:59.720 --> 01:04:03.720
It's also mainly because they were worried that Left 4 Dead 2 was just going to be some add-on crap,

01:04:03.720 --> 01:04:06.720
and it's not going to be that much of a game to stand alone by itself.

01:04:06.720 --> 01:04:15.720
And they really have added a lot to Left 4 Dead 2 to really warrant it as another release, and not just add-on stuff.

01:04:15.720 --> 01:04:19.720
Do you think they'll continue to support Left 4 Dead 1, even while Left 4 Dead 2 is out?

01:04:19.720 --> 01:04:23.720
I mean, EverQuest 1 still got upgrade packs, and EverQuest 2 is out.

01:04:23.720 --> 01:04:26.720
Maybe. I don't know. Maybe. You never know.

01:04:26.720 --> 01:04:30.720
Well, you know, I never understood the boycott to begin with, so I can't say this is...

01:04:30.720 --> 01:04:34.720
Well, actually, it is surprising. You don't usually hear about boycotts coming to an end.

01:04:34.720 --> 01:04:37.720
You just hear about, come to my online petition and sign it.

01:04:37.720 --> 01:04:44.720
So I guess I have to say, I haven't really heard that before, but it is kind of lol-tastic that those guys actually went out to Valve and now they're canceling their boycott.

01:04:44.720 --> 01:04:46.720
But, you know, whatever.

01:04:46.720 --> 01:04:49.720
It was a little bit of a silly boycott in the first place, I think.

01:04:49.720 --> 01:04:53.720
So would we have this problem if the game came out like a year from now?

01:04:53.720 --> 01:04:55.720
Probably not, because...

01:04:55.720 --> 01:04:58.720
And what if they had never released any upgrades for Left 4 Dead?

01:04:58.720 --> 01:05:04.720
You know, I kind of go back to the thing, like, what does Valve really owe you outside of the base game?

01:05:04.720 --> 01:05:05.720
You know?

01:05:05.720 --> 01:05:10.720
Look at Madden. I mean, they have a bunch of updates and stuff from Madden, and there's a new version that comes out every year.

01:05:10.720 --> 01:05:16.720
I don't see why they need to owe them anything, just like Need for Speed or a lot of EA games.

01:05:16.720 --> 01:05:21.720
Who cares? You know? You buy it or you don't buy it. That's it, you know?

01:05:21.720 --> 01:05:24.720
And you'll bitch and moan about it all you want, but...

01:05:24.720 --> 01:05:26.720
Post to the internet on your favorite forum.

01:05:26.720 --> 01:05:29.720
Yeah, post to the internet. You know, complain that it's not President Cat.

01:05:29.720 --> 01:05:35.720
And then, you know, you'll just buy it anyways, because you're consumer whore.

01:05:35.720 --> 01:05:37.720
And how.

01:05:37.720 --> 01:05:40.720
Alright, let's move on to another segment we love to do here on the program.

01:05:40.720 --> 01:05:44.720
It is a segment we like to call the Classic Game of the Week.

01:05:44.720 --> 01:05:50.720
It's a segment where Dark Soccer actually goes into the video game Vault and pulls out one of her favorite classic games and she says,

01:05:50.720 --> 01:05:55.720
You know what, bitches? You should be playing this game right now.

01:05:55.720 --> 01:05:59.720
So Dark Soccer, you've dived into the vault and you've picked out a game that you think everyone should be playing.

01:05:59.720 --> 01:06:00.720
What game?

01:06:00.720 --> 01:06:02.720
I died.

01:06:02.720 --> 01:06:05.720
Fine, you swam. I don't know what you did. Whatever you did.

01:06:05.720 --> 01:06:07.720
Um, the classic game is...

01:06:07.720 --> 01:06:09.720
Dude, dude, dude, dude, dude your way in there.

01:06:09.720 --> 01:06:12.720
Is Hexen.

01:06:12.720 --> 01:06:15.720
Not Heretic, but Hexen.

01:06:15.720 --> 01:06:19.720
And this is actually the best quality of the music I could find other than having them.

01:06:19.720 --> 01:06:23.720
Punch. Smack. Chicken.

01:06:23.720 --> 01:06:30.720
So yeah, Hexen is a first person shooter that was put up by Raven and published by ID.

01:06:30.720 --> 01:06:33.720
I-B-E.

01:06:33.720 --> 01:06:47.720
And it's actually the sequel to Heretic, however it has better points to it, which makes me really put it over the first one that came out.

01:06:47.720 --> 01:06:57.720
There were PlayStation, Saturn, and N64 versions, but the N64 one was the only really good one that came out.

01:06:57.720 --> 01:07:02.720
It was the best conversion. The Saturn and PlayStation ones actually had some...

01:07:02.720 --> 01:07:05.720
They were only one player and had some frame rate losses.

01:07:05.720 --> 01:07:18.720
So anyway, you are playing as Kronos who is going on and you actually can play as either a fighter, a cleric, or a mage.

01:07:18.720 --> 01:07:34.720
And they have their own different weapons and the fighter is mainly a melee, the cleric has special weapons and healing effects and the mage has long range weapons and is also pretty damn fragile.

01:07:34.720 --> 01:07:43.720
So it's first person. You go through these sprightly, fake 3D places and smite things.

01:07:43.720 --> 01:07:45.720
It was Doom with Magic.

01:07:45.720 --> 01:07:52.720
It was Doom with Magic. And actually Hexen uses the Doom engine. So you can jump. You can jump.

01:07:52.720 --> 01:08:07.720
You also have a hub system of level progression and this one actually had, where the previous ones used on MIDI music, this one actually used full Redbook audio.

01:08:07.720 --> 01:08:16.720
You've got moving walls in the game. So they actually had to modify Doom's engine.

01:08:16.720 --> 01:08:24.720
Also, the source code was released in 2008 so now you can get Hexen for Linux, which is pretty good.

01:08:24.720 --> 01:08:30.720
And also it's compatible with a lot of the Doom source ports.

01:08:30.720 --> 01:08:41.720
There was an expansion pack called Death Kings of the Dark Citadel and it had 20 new levels and deathmatch levels.

01:08:41.720 --> 01:08:50.720
And you actually had to either buy it in store or by mail order.

01:08:50.720 --> 01:08:56.720
It's just a really good game. It actually had some of the best cheats ever in it.

01:08:56.720 --> 01:09:01.720
The NRA code was all weapons.

01:09:01.720 --> 01:09:04.720
You can turn yourself into a chicken.

01:09:04.720 --> 01:09:06.720
Seriously, you can turn yourself into a chicken.

01:09:06.720 --> 01:09:08.720
It's the anti-Zelda.

01:09:08.720 --> 01:09:10.720
It was a fun game.

01:09:10.720 --> 01:09:15.720
I know you usually don't like first person shooters because they make you sick because they're so realistic.

01:09:15.720 --> 01:09:17.720
This was sprite based.

01:09:17.720 --> 01:09:18.720
Yeah, sprite based isn't as bad.

01:09:18.720 --> 01:09:22.720
It didn't really make me all that motion sick. I'd have to stop because I'd get headaches.

01:09:22.720 --> 01:09:28.720
But it didn't really make me full on sick to my stomach, ready to throw up on the cat or anything.

01:09:28.720 --> 01:09:33.720
Alright, there you go kids. Your classic game of the week, Hexen from id.

01:09:33.720 --> 01:09:37.720
Which you can still get. In fact, someone in chat was saying they were just playing it earlier today.

01:09:37.720 --> 01:09:42.720
Who was saying that? I just saw it in chat a minute ago.

01:09:42.720 --> 01:09:44.720
Gosh, I'm behind on chat or something.

01:09:44.720 --> 01:09:46.720
Sorry, somebody had said they were playing. Oh, there it is.

01:09:46.720 --> 01:09:49.720
Frisbee says, I was just playing this online today through school tag.

01:09:49.720 --> 01:09:52.720
So you can play it, I guess, online in different places.

01:09:52.720 --> 01:09:55.720
So check it out.

01:09:55.720 --> 01:09:58.720
Deathwishing, I guess, hasn't heard the chat on the show before.

01:09:58.720 --> 01:10:02.720
Wants to know, how do you get sick from playing first person shooters?

01:10:02.720 --> 01:10:05.720
It's called vertigo.

01:10:05.720 --> 01:10:09.720
I have a friend at work who has that real bad too.

01:10:09.720 --> 01:10:12.720
She can't get on boats or anything. It makes her very sick.

01:10:12.720 --> 01:10:18.720
It's just, I really don't know what it is. It's something between the eye and inner ear, I guess.

01:10:18.720 --> 01:10:27.720
But it's like, I guess, I think it's that your brain starts compensating for the motion that it sees.

01:10:27.720 --> 01:10:33.720
When your body isn't feeling the same motion and it causes a conflict in your balance.

01:10:33.720 --> 01:10:36.720
That just makes me sick right away.

01:10:36.720 --> 01:10:40.720
Also, another thing that will do it to me is rendering errors.

01:10:40.720 --> 01:10:45.720
You know, like when Sonic Adventure, when the Japanese version had all those bad rendering errors

01:10:45.720 --> 01:10:50.720
and the collision detection wasn't bad and you could actually see through the wall at some points and see the edge.

01:10:50.720 --> 01:10:53.720
It's like, I couldn't process it. It would just stop.

01:10:53.720 --> 01:10:57.720
I would literally have to close my eyes because it would make my head hurt.

01:10:57.720 --> 01:11:01.720
HungryMrKrunk in chat says, I can't play Spyro. I get sick.

01:11:01.720 --> 01:11:05.720
Well, is that motion sickness or just because you're playing Spyro?

01:11:05.720 --> 01:11:09.720
Brad from Paw Culture says, well, Vertigo, it's a good flick.

01:11:09.720 --> 01:11:11.720
Vertigo, shoot.

01:11:11.720 --> 01:11:13.720
It's a good movie, but...

01:11:13.720 --> 01:11:20.720
I did know who did the opening credits for that, too, because we studied it in my typography or my graphic design class.

01:11:20.720 --> 01:11:24.720
Because the opening titles to it were so amazing.

01:11:24.720 --> 01:11:26.720
Wasn't it the same as Psycho?

01:11:26.720 --> 01:11:27.720
I think it was Saul Bass.

01:11:27.720 --> 01:11:33.720
Saul Bass is seriously the best movie title designer ever, but I digress.

01:11:33.720 --> 01:11:36.720
Death Wishing just seems to think it's bad games that make you sick, but...

01:11:36.720 --> 01:11:44.720
Well, GoldenEye, which is supposed to be one of the best N64 first person shooters, made me really sick.

01:11:44.720 --> 01:11:48.720
I couldn't play Unreal.

01:11:48.720 --> 01:11:52.720
I couldn't play Portal. Oh my god.

01:11:52.720 --> 01:11:56.720
You want to see me just get so sick? Dan had to play through Portal for me.

01:11:56.720 --> 01:11:58.720
I would tell him what to do.

01:11:58.720 --> 01:11:59.720
So that you could look away and...

01:11:59.720 --> 01:12:07.720
I would tell him how to pass, because I could easily see how to pass all of the puzzles and everything.

01:12:07.720 --> 01:12:13.720
But I would literally have to tell him, because the moment that I held the controller in my hand and actually looked at the screen to do it,

01:12:13.720 --> 01:12:16.720
I would be sick. Katamari does it. Katamari makes me really sick.

01:12:16.720 --> 01:12:20.720
I can't play more than two levels before I get way too ill to keep playing.

01:12:20.720 --> 01:12:21.720
That sucks.

01:12:21.720 --> 01:12:24.720
Alright, well, hopefully they'll come out with an app for that.

01:12:24.720 --> 01:12:26.720
I didn't do it on my iPhone.

01:12:26.720 --> 01:12:28.720
Well, iPhone's so tiny.

01:12:28.720 --> 01:12:29.720
I didn't get that sick on my iPhone.

01:12:29.720 --> 01:12:30.720
You probably don't get as immersed there.

01:12:30.720 --> 01:12:31.720
Yeah.

01:12:31.720 --> 01:12:33.720
SGA-100 Matt does confirm it's Sawbass.

01:12:33.720 --> 01:12:34.720
Yeah.

01:12:34.720 --> 01:12:36.720
I knew it was Sawbass.

01:12:36.720 --> 01:12:43.720
Alright, for anyone who ever wanted to know, I don't know if you do, but Sawbass is one of my designer heroes.

01:12:43.720 --> 01:12:48.720
So, just go watch the opening credits for the man with the golden arm and you'll know.

01:12:48.720 --> 01:12:49.720
Alright.

01:12:49.720 --> 01:12:54.720
Well, that is going to bring this Part A of Orange Lounge Radio to a close, but don't go anywhere kids,

01:12:54.720 --> 01:12:56.720
because we'll be right back with plenty more tonight in Part B.

01:12:56.720 --> 01:13:01.720
We have our rapid fire news, talking about some news about Final Fantasy XI, Mass Effect 2, and so forth.

01:13:01.720 --> 01:13:03.720
And then, of course, our long stories.

01:13:03.720 --> 01:13:05.720
We're going to talk about people getting banned from Xbox and why.

01:13:05.720 --> 01:13:09.720
More talk about a Wii HD and a new peripheral for the Wii.

01:13:09.720 --> 01:13:13.720
That is all coming up in just a little bit here on Orange Lounge Radio.

01:13:13.720 --> 01:13:15.720
So, we will be right back.

01:13:15.720 --> 01:13:22.720
Stay tuned.

01:13:22.720 --> 01:13:24.720
Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio.

01:13:24.720 --> 01:13:32.720
Live on this lovely Sunday evening, October the 18th of 2009, where we are taping the 341st episode of our show.

01:13:32.720 --> 01:13:35.720
And during the break, we heard some music there from DJ Hero.

01:13:35.720 --> 01:13:37.720
You can only hear that live, sadly, because it is copyright.

01:13:37.720 --> 01:13:39.720
We can't put it in the podcast.

01:13:39.720 --> 01:13:41.720
Kind of like what we did last week, except this time it wasn't the demo.

01:13:41.720 --> 01:13:42.720
It was the full game.

01:13:42.720 --> 01:13:43.720
Yeah.

01:13:43.720 --> 01:13:45.720
Paul Van Dyke, you were saying you had a favorite song already?

01:13:45.720 --> 01:13:49.720
Yes, that Paul Van Dyke track, the one we played, was absolutely awesome.

01:13:49.720 --> 01:13:53.720
They had a demo online, or a little clip online on their YouTube channel.

01:13:53.720 --> 01:13:55.720
I just love that song.

01:13:55.720 --> 01:13:57.720
I couldn't wait to play it, and it's really hard.

01:13:57.720 --> 01:14:01.720
It has a lot of cross-fading in there, and it's really hard.

01:14:01.720 --> 01:14:06.720
I was actually able to listen on the iPhone app for All Games.

01:14:06.720 --> 01:14:09.720
Which, by the way, if you own an iPhone and you don't have this app, it's awesome.

01:14:09.720 --> 01:14:14.720
You should check it out at All Games' website, or just look for it in the store.

01:14:14.720 --> 01:14:20.720
It's an application where you can actually just play All Games Radio without needing any other type of tuner program or anything.

01:14:20.720 --> 01:14:21.720
It's amazing.

01:14:21.720 --> 01:14:22.720
Noelle's is amazing?

01:14:22.720 --> 01:14:23.720
What?

01:14:23.720 --> 01:14:24.720
Chicken.

01:14:24.720 --> 01:14:25.720
Chicken is amazing.

01:14:25.720 --> 01:14:27.720
Are you enjoying the Kentucky Fried Chicken that I went and got on Parade?

01:14:27.720 --> 01:14:28.720
Yes, thank you.

01:14:28.720 --> 01:14:31.720
You know, I could have, you know, I forgot.

01:14:31.720 --> 01:14:35.720
I could just have that autoplay, like the actual tracks I wanted, so they'd be flawless.

01:14:35.720 --> 01:14:36.720
But it's more fun to play.

01:14:36.720 --> 01:14:38.720
Yeah, it's more fun to play it.

01:14:38.720 --> 01:14:48.720
Folks, we have breaking news here at Orange Lounge Radio.

01:14:48.720 --> 01:14:50.720
We have breaking news developing right now.

01:14:50.720 --> 01:14:59.720
The folks at Rina We, the president cat game that we were laughing hysterically at in Part A, they have responded on their Twitter.

01:14:59.720 --> 01:15:04.720
And boy have they ever, I don't think they know what the hell is going on right now.

01:15:04.720 --> 01:15:10.720
They responded to some, one of our listeners, Technicolor, who tweeted our message that said, please release this game in the USA.

01:15:10.720 --> 01:15:11.720
They said, really?

01:15:11.720 --> 01:15:12.720
I'm so excited.

01:15:12.720 --> 01:15:13.720
Is this spam?

01:15:13.720 --> 01:15:15.720
So, A, we know they speak English.

01:15:15.720 --> 01:15:18.720
Even though they've been tweeting in Japanese, somebody over there speaks English.

01:15:18.720 --> 01:15:21.720
And then they tweeted us and some other listeners, can I ask one question?

01:15:21.720 --> 01:15:22.720
How do you know this game?

01:15:22.720 --> 01:15:25.720
And I think somebody said back to them that they were hearing it here on Orange Lounge Radio.

01:15:25.720 --> 01:15:27.720
They tweeted back, oh my goodness, really?

01:15:27.720 --> 01:15:29.720
Thank you so much.

01:15:29.720 --> 01:15:31.720
I'm talking about this with coworkers right now.

01:15:31.720 --> 01:15:33.720
They are all excited.

01:15:33.720 --> 01:15:36.720
If this information on some website, let me know the URL.

01:15:36.720 --> 01:15:37.720
Please retweet.

01:15:37.720 --> 01:15:42.720
And they've been corresponding with one of our listeners on Twitter, Edmund Lu, I guess, has been helping them out.

01:15:42.720 --> 01:15:50.720
And they told them that we were getting it from playasia.com, the release dates, which is where I read the Japanese release dates from.

01:15:50.720 --> 01:15:53.720
And they responded, thank you so much.

01:15:53.720 --> 01:15:56.720
And they retweeted so that all their followers could see it.

01:15:56.720 --> 01:16:00.720
OLR talked about it on their radio show, and it really looks like an interesting game to play.

01:16:00.720 --> 01:16:03.720
And then they said, thanks, is this popular in the USA?

01:16:03.720 --> 01:16:04.720
Sorry for many questions.

01:16:04.720 --> 01:16:15.720
So in the scope of just that time that Loki was playing DJ Hero during the break, they've tweeted six times about this President Cat takes over the USA tonight, Life on Orange Lounge Radio thing going on.

01:16:15.720 --> 01:16:23.720
I also replied to that last thing saying that, yeah, some gamers like that kind of thing, stuff other than the sports and the typical RPG.

01:16:23.720 --> 01:16:26.720
And that I personally love those kinds of games.

01:16:26.720 --> 01:16:32.720
Oh, less than a minute ago, they have responded to one of my tweets because I wrote them back saying,

01:16:32.720 --> 01:16:37.720
we found it on our weekly Japanese release date reading and think we need more lolcat inspired games.

01:16:37.720 --> 01:16:39.720
How can we help get game in USA?

01:16:39.720 --> 01:16:42.720
I said, it's not popular yet, but we think if it was released here, that it just might be.

01:16:42.720 --> 01:16:45.720
There are many piano playing cat loving people here.

01:16:45.720 --> 01:16:50.720
And they just said, you mean game in English? Retweet.

01:16:50.720 --> 01:16:54.720
Okay, so I'm going to respond, yes, basically.

01:16:54.720 --> 01:16:57.720
Yes, game in English.

01:17:04.720 --> 01:17:06.720
Okay, so sorry for the dead air. So I'm tweeting back right now.

01:17:06.720 --> 01:17:09.720
Yes, game in English and playable on our American Wiis.

01:17:09.720 --> 01:17:13.720
And somebody in the chat room is like shouting, get them on the show, get them on the show.

01:17:13.720 --> 01:17:17.720
I don't know if Japan can call our 800 numbers.

01:17:17.720 --> 01:17:24.720
We have a friend that lives in Japan who is currently, you know, Julie.

01:17:24.720 --> 01:17:25.720
Yeah.

01:17:25.720 --> 01:17:26.720
Julie is in Japan right now.

01:17:26.720 --> 01:17:27.720
Well, could we get...

01:17:27.720 --> 01:17:30.720
Julie is with Krista. Krista speaks fluent Japanese.

01:17:30.720 --> 01:17:33.720
I wonder if we can get them on Skype or something. I don't know.

01:17:33.720 --> 01:17:37.720
I'll tell them, they added us back so I can direct message them. So I'll tell them to email me.

01:17:37.720 --> 01:17:41.720
I don't want to do anything tonight because it's all panning out too fast, but we'll try to get them on a future show.

01:17:41.720 --> 01:17:43.720
I am going to love this.

01:17:43.720 --> 01:17:48.720
AlphaCananagram in chat says, this is one kick-ass episode of OLR.

01:17:48.720 --> 01:17:54.720
Let me put it this way, okay? There's many companies out there like Tomo, well not necessarily Tomo,

01:17:54.720 --> 01:17:59.720
but was it UFO Interactive Games and stuff like that, they port really obscure shit.

01:17:59.720 --> 01:18:08.720
I mean, just really obscure Japanese RPGs or not even Japanese RPGs, like Japanese shooters and just weird games, you know, for budget prices.

01:18:08.720 --> 01:18:14.720
One of these companies could easily pick this game up. It's just, you know, whether they think they can actually sell some copies of it.

01:18:14.720 --> 01:18:19.720
They just tweeted it again. And keep in mind, it's like noon in Japan on a Monday morning right now, right?

01:18:19.720 --> 01:18:21.720
Because they're up across on the other side of the date lines. It's probably about noon right there.

01:18:21.720 --> 01:18:27.720
And they just tweeted again, great people, awesome. And they put at OLR, there are many piano playing cat loving people,

01:18:27.720 --> 01:18:34.720
because that's what I said to them. So this is amazing. So we're going to correspond with them.

01:18:34.720 --> 01:18:40.720
They could do like a viral advertisement or whatever with keyboard cat. I think they could have something, you know?

01:18:40.720 --> 01:18:46.720
They could get the whole main loving people. Especially if the price is right, you know?

01:18:46.720 --> 01:18:52.720
Okay, so we may need your friend in Japan to somehow get a hold of these people and talk to them in Japanese.

01:18:52.720 --> 01:18:57.720
I don't know if we can make that happen, but I want them on the show. This needs to happen.

01:18:57.720 --> 01:19:04.720
They love us. We love what they're doing. We are going to get this game released in the USA. And dammit, it all started right here tonight.

01:19:04.720 --> 01:19:06.720
Let me see if she's online.

01:19:06.720 --> 01:19:13.720
Alright, anyhow. Anyhow, I don't know what we have to do. If we're going to have to do one of those silly online petitions or what.

01:19:13.720 --> 01:19:19.720
But meanwhile, we have a show to do. We got to get to Twitter topics. Here's the thing, I am not prepared for Twitter topics,

01:19:19.720 --> 01:19:22.720
because usually I can just click on the at OLR messages and they're all right there.

01:19:22.720 --> 01:19:27.720
But tonight, because of President Cat, our Twitter is full, so I need to go back a little bit.

01:19:27.720 --> 01:19:30.720
I'm going to mix things up a little. Why not? It's one of those nights.

01:19:30.720 --> 01:19:34.720
I think we should put a post on the front page about, you know, bring President Cat to the US.

01:19:34.720 --> 01:19:36.720
I mean, that would be awesome.

01:19:36.720 --> 01:19:43.720
We'll figure something out. Absolutely. Maybe we can get some of our friends and Game Ballers involved.

01:19:43.720 --> 01:19:49.720
I don't know what we can do. We'll figure it out. All I know is that all unfolding live here on Sunday night might be a bit much.

01:19:49.720 --> 01:19:56.720
So, we're going to get into some Twitter, not Twitter topics, I'm sorry, fast news. Loki's going to cover some quick news stories for us.

01:19:56.720 --> 01:20:05.720
Yes. Okay, so Final Fantasy XI The Ultimate Collection, not the first collection that they released on PC, but probably the last,

01:20:05.720 --> 01:20:12.720
will be coming out, of course, for $20 soon. November 10th is the date that's coming out.

01:20:12.720 --> 01:20:22.720
And actually, that will be coming out on 360 as well. And as you might expect, it's basically the game plus all the downloadable expansions and whatnot.

01:20:22.720 --> 01:20:27.720
For $20, it's not a bad price at all, especially if you're looking to get into Final Fantasy XI.

01:20:27.720 --> 01:20:35.720
Although, at this point, I would wonder why you wouldn't just wait for Final Fantasy XIV, but hey, to each their own and $20 is very cheap.

01:20:35.720 --> 01:20:47.720
Also, Zen Studios, the creators of such wonderful games like Zen Pinball, Pinball FX, and The Punisher of No Mercy, are releasing a brand new game to the PlayStation Network called Planet Mini Golf.

01:20:47.720 --> 01:20:59.720
It is going to be a game featuring 144 mini golf holes with several exhilarating courses around the world, they say, complete with crazy obstacles and six customizable characters.

01:20:59.720 --> 01:21:04.720
And it looks pretty sweet. I love me some mini golf games.

01:21:04.720 --> 01:21:14.720
Finally, as rumored, Sony is releasing a 250GB PlayStation 3 slim model over here in the US as well.

01:21:14.720 --> 01:21:24.720
It is coming standalone, no packing games with that, and only for $50 more than the 120GB system, so $349.99 will be the price on that.

01:21:24.720 --> 01:21:30.720
Which is not a bad deal if you're looking to really pack a lot of crap onto your PlayStation 3 hard drive.

01:21:30.720 --> 01:21:36.720
So that will be coming out around November 3rd.

01:21:36.720 --> 01:21:42.720
Alright, sorry, they wrote back again. I hate to keep going back to this, but I'm loving this.

01:21:42.720 --> 01:21:48.720
They're asking their boss right now. They put, wow, ask my boss, haha, wait a minute please.

01:21:48.720 --> 01:21:54.720
And retweeted our message about, yes, game in English and playable on our American Wiis, how can we help make this happen?

01:21:54.720 --> 01:22:02.720
So, some executive at some Japanese game company right now is hearing about some crappy little internet show in America that wants this damn game.

01:22:02.720 --> 01:22:04.720
Dude, totally want President Cat.

01:22:04.720 --> 01:22:06.720
Amazing. I love the internet.

01:22:06.720 --> 01:22:10.720
And hey, you know, maybe if all its fellows will just send us a Japanese Wii in the game.

01:22:10.720 --> 01:22:15.720
Just put it on WiiWare. I mean, honestly, it can't be that big of a game. I mean, just put it on WiiWare.

01:22:15.720 --> 01:22:16.720
President Cat!

01:22:16.720 --> 01:22:23.720
Alright, well, when Twitter ladies, bosses, or guys, I don't know who it is, but when that boss gets back to them, we will have more.

01:22:23.720 --> 01:22:27.720
Meantime, more late-breaking, well, not late-breaking, but rapid-fire news anyway.

01:22:27.720 --> 01:22:33.720
News about Super Mario Bros. Wii, the new one coming out. Did you know Princess Peach is not playable in the game?

01:22:33.720 --> 01:22:38.720
Actually, this was brought up recently in an interview with Miyamoto, and Miyamoto commented,

01:22:38.720 --> 01:22:44.720
quote, I thought it'd be nice to have her as a playable character, but the Toad characters have a similar physique to a Mario character than Peach does.

01:22:44.720 --> 01:22:52.720
And if one of the four had a dress, we'd have to come up with a special programming to handle how the skirt is handled in the gameplay, and that's really the only reason why Peach isn't playable.

01:22:52.720 --> 01:22:56.720
Of course, if we had Wario in there, we'd have to program a way to make him fart.

01:22:56.720 --> 01:23:05.720
Is that maybe a throwback to the fact that people in Super Smash Bros. Melee were just pausing the game to do upskirt cams on Princess Peach and Daisy? I don't know.

01:23:05.720 --> 01:23:10.720
But regardless, it sounds like they're trying to skirt the issue. Her, her.

01:23:10.720 --> 01:23:17.720
Mass Effect 2 now has a release date. It's coming out in North America on January 26th, and it's coming out in Europe on the 29th.

01:23:17.720 --> 01:23:25.720
Is there really anything else you need to know? Well, you might want to know about the GameStop pre-order bonus that they're advertising, including Terminus Armor.

01:23:25.720 --> 01:23:31.720
It will increase the run speed and personal shields, and augmenting weapons with an additional magazine of reserve ammo.

01:23:31.720 --> 01:23:39.720
And then the M90 Blackstorm Heavy Weapon will generate a high-powered localized gravity well, accelerating particles to near-infinite mass.

01:23:39.720 --> 01:23:45.720
So there you go, some pre-order bonuses for Mass Effect 2, officially dated for January, both North America and Europe.

01:23:45.720 --> 01:23:56.720
Duels of the Planeswalker gets a new expansion on Xbox 360. They think the name is Duel of the Dragons, but it is being priced only 400 Microsoft points.

01:23:56.720 --> 01:24:04.720
It is coming out on the 21st of October. It's going to add three playable decks and three unlockable cards for all of the original decks.

01:24:04.720 --> 01:24:10.720
So there you go, some new expansions coming to Magic the Gathering, which hopefully you didn't forget was out there on the Wii.

01:24:10.720 --> 01:24:18.720
Let's do Jamie's Stories. We never did our closed deck tournament, Rob. We never did, we need to.

01:24:18.720 --> 01:24:24.720
Well, how about some news about Alpha Protocol, which actually really isn't very much news because I think we expected it.

01:24:24.720 --> 01:24:31.720
It is delayed instead of being out, even for Christmas, they're pushing it back to Spring 2010.

01:24:31.720 --> 01:24:41.720
But Obsidian, the developer, is actually pretty happy about that because it gives them more time to make sure it's really polished and looking the way that they want it to.

01:24:41.720 --> 01:24:48.720
So I think that's a good thing. I would rather wait for a good product than have to deal with substandard.

01:24:48.720 --> 01:24:53.720
Yeah, delays aren't always a bad thing. Delays can sometimes end out pretty good.

01:24:53.720 --> 01:25:06.720
Also, two characters for Tatsunoko vs. Capcom have been released. We have Condor Nojo as Joe the Condor from Gatchaman.

01:25:06.720 --> 01:25:10.720
He was G2, the one who always wanted to fire the bird missile.

01:25:10.720 --> 01:25:18.720
Also, just to say, for anyone who watched Battle of the Planets, it was Jason. He was Dirk in G-Force.

01:25:18.720 --> 01:25:23.720
Anyway, I'm the Gatchaman fangirl, so I'm very happy about this.

01:25:23.720 --> 01:25:31.720
And then there's also Zero. Zero is going to be out, as in Zero from the Mega Man X series.

01:25:31.720 --> 01:25:34.720
So that's going to be pretty sweet.

01:25:34.720 --> 01:25:41.720
I actually watched videos of them in motion and it was epic.

01:25:41.720 --> 01:25:53.720
Also, the team up with... they had Joe and Jun on one of the matches I saw and they did the Tatsumaki attack.

01:25:53.720 --> 01:25:57.720
That was pretty cool. That was pretty damn cool. I'm looking so forward to this.

01:25:57.720 --> 01:26:00.720
Except I really don't like what they did with the Tatsunoko logo in English.

01:26:00.720 --> 01:26:06.720
It doesn't look nice. They should have just stuck to the Japanese one.

01:26:06.720 --> 01:26:13.720
And, last but definitely not least, Blur is going to be in LEGO Rock Band.

01:26:13.720 --> 01:26:27.720
And there are little blur-shaped, you know, LEGO stick people all bricked out for LEGO Rock Band, so that makes me pretty happy.

01:26:27.720 --> 01:26:35.720
I'm just sort of laughing at the little Damon and the little Graham. I think that's pretty funny.

01:26:35.720 --> 01:26:39.720
That's just cute. But that's it.

01:26:39.720 --> 01:26:45.720
Alright. Moving on, we're going to get into some Twitter topics. You guys ready to do Twitter?

01:26:45.720 --> 01:26:49.720
I know we had a lot of Twitter tonight with what the developments were present in CAT,

01:26:49.720 --> 01:26:54.720
which apparently they just posted some type of comic that has our chat room in stitches right now.

01:26:54.720 --> 01:27:00.720
I'm loving this. I mean, live radio doesn't... I'm serious. We should petition this stuff.

01:27:00.720 --> 01:27:04.720
We should send it all out, you know, tell people why this game needs to come over here.

01:27:04.720 --> 01:27:06.720
Well, let's wait and see how they respond.

01:27:06.720 --> 01:27:08.720
I can actually read some of this.

01:27:08.720 --> 01:27:13.720
Alright. Anyhow, I'm sorry. I didn't mean for President CAT to take over the show, but goddamn.

01:27:13.720 --> 01:27:16.720
This is cute.

01:27:16.720 --> 01:27:22.720
O-L-R-0, President CAT 1. Let's just face it. President CAT is the fourth host tonight.

01:27:22.720 --> 01:27:27.720
Alright. Twitter topics, dammit. Things that don't involve President CAT, believe it or not.

01:27:27.720 --> 01:27:30.720
Questions when our tweeters give us stuff at O-L-R.

01:27:30.720 --> 01:27:35.720
Deekman wants me to remind you all, you can now post pictures to the photo stream.

01:27:35.720 --> 01:27:39.720
So if you send a picture to pics at orangelaungeradio.com,

01:27:39.720 --> 01:27:44.720
it will now go to our website at www.orangelaungeradio.com,

01:27:44.720 --> 01:27:47.720
and it'll be right up there for everyone to see.

01:27:47.720 --> 01:27:51.720
So don't send pictures of penises, or I swear to God, we'll remove this like that.

01:27:51.720 --> 01:27:53.720
But if you have, like, gaming stuff you want to put,

01:27:53.720 --> 01:27:59.720
or maybe it's a challenge this week to show our love for President CAT,

01:27:59.720 --> 01:28:02.720
you need to upload pictures. In fact, who should give a challenge to the listeners every week?

01:28:02.720 --> 01:28:03.720
I love this idea.

01:28:03.720 --> 01:28:06.720
Since President CAT has taken over the show tonight,

01:28:06.720 --> 01:28:10.720
we want people to upload pictures to the stream showing their love for President CAT,

01:28:10.720 --> 01:28:14.720
because this will help the developers show that they are the next big thing in the U.S.

01:28:14.720 --> 01:28:16.720
Let's make that happen.

01:28:16.720 --> 01:28:22.720
Alright. I can't fight the adornment of this. It's too cute.

01:28:22.720 --> 01:28:27.720
It really is. Like, the podcast listeners who aren't in chat and can't see all these URLs tonight

01:28:27.720 --> 01:28:31.720
are like, you've got to be smoking crack. But, like, seriously, look at the website.

01:28:31.720 --> 01:28:33.720
It is cute overload.

01:28:33.720 --> 01:28:37.720
I hope they don't think that I actually know more Japanese than what I just posted to them.

01:28:37.720 --> 01:28:42.720
I just said it was funny.

01:28:42.720 --> 01:28:45.720
Alright. Anyhow, other Twitter topics going on.

01:28:45.720 --> 01:28:50.720
Oh, shoot. I somehow accidentally clicked on an ad.

01:28:50.720 --> 01:28:52.720
And now I've got to, oh, man.

01:28:52.720 --> 01:28:53.720
No.

01:28:53.720 --> 01:28:55.720
Now I've got to get the stories up again.

01:28:55.720 --> 01:28:57.720
I'm going to fail.

01:28:57.720 --> 01:29:02.720
Ryan Belknap wants to know, what do you guys think of Glee and Flash Forward?

01:29:02.720 --> 01:29:05.720
I love Glee. I think that show is amazing.

01:29:05.720 --> 01:29:09.720
Flash Forward, I watched the first episode, but wasn't able to watch anything after that.

01:29:09.720 --> 01:29:12.720
I just haven't had time, because I've been watching a bunch of other shows.

01:29:12.720 --> 01:29:15.720
My wife watches Glee. I've watched a few episodes of Glee.

01:29:15.720 --> 01:29:20.720
It's okay. I just, you know, during the week with so much stuff that I'm watching on TV,

01:29:20.720 --> 01:29:24.720
I try to get time to work on the cabinet and stuff.

01:29:24.720 --> 01:29:26.720
And I normally skip out on that show.

01:29:26.720 --> 01:29:28.720
But it's entertaining.

01:29:28.720 --> 01:29:33.720
And my wife is excited at the fact that they're going to be going on tour.

01:29:33.720 --> 01:29:35.720
So she wants to go see that.

01:29:35.720 --> 01:29:37.720
Did that get officially announced?

01:29:37.720 --> 01:29:39.720
I don't know. I want to see it too if it goes on tour.

01:29:39.720 --> 01:29:41.720
I'll take your wife if you don't want to go.

01:29:41.720 --> 01:29:46.720
And then, also, Flash Forward I've actually watched.

01:29:46.720 --> 01:29:49.720
It's good, but it's slow. That's the only problem.

01:29:49.720 --> 01:29:51.720
But it is getting interesting.

01:29:51.720 --> 01:29:53.720
But it is very slow.

01:29:53.720 --> 01:29:55.720
It's better. But I watch them both.

01:29:55.720 --> 01:29:57.720
It's by the people who do the 4400.

01:29:57.720 --> 01:29:59.720
But you know what I haven't been watching, though?

01:29:59.720 --> 01:30:01.720
And I hear it's actually good this season?

01:30:01.720 --> 01:30:02.720
Heroes.

01:30:02.720 --> 01:30:04.720
Really? And I stopped watching it, too.

01:30:04.720 --> 01:30:06.720
Because I'm watching House. Because House is on the same time.

01:30:06.720 --> 01:30:08.720
I'm sorry. House wins.

01:30:08.720 --> 01:30:11.720
Can I say, though, I got introduced to It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia the other day.

01:30:11.720 --> 01:30:16.720
Oh my god. That show is fucking funny. Oh my god, that show is funny.

01:30:16.720 --> 01:30:18.720
I've really been, like, kind of...

01:30:18.720 --> 01:30:20.720
I don't watch that show regularly.

01:30:20.720 --> 01:30:24.720
We were actually killing time between, like, a show and South Park or something.

01:30:24.720 --> 01:30:27.720
So we turned it on. I'm like, I forgot how funny this show is.

01:30:27.720 --> 01:30:29.720
It's just hilarious.

01:30:29.720 --> 01:30:32.720
And Chat Room reminded me that a couple of people in Chat are saying,

01:30:32.720 --> 01:30:34.720
Don't forget V starts in a couple weeks.

01:30:34.720 --> 01:30:36.720
Oh my god!

01:30:36.720 --> 01:30:40.720
I have two words for you. Fuck yes.

01:30:40.720 --> 01:30:42.720
No, you don't know how giddy this makes me.

01:30:42.720 --> 01:30:45.720
You've talked about V, like, five years ago on the show.

01:30:45.720 --> 01:30:47.720
You've talked about it for a very long time. I know you love V.

01:30:47.720 --> 01:30:50.720
And you remember when that book came out, how I read the whole thing?

01:30:50.720 --> 01:30:51.720
Mm-hmm.

01:30:51.720 --> 01:30:52.720
Like, right here on the show?

01:30:52.720 --> 01:30:53.720
During the show? Yeah, I know.

01:30:53.720 --> 01:30:54.720
That book was...

01:30:54.720 --> 01:30:56.720
I was like, Jamie, time to do the story. What, V?

01:30:56.720 --> 01:30:57.720
I'm like, fuck you, V.

01:30:57.720 --> 01:31:00.720
No, that was epic. That was epic.

01:31:00.720 --> 01:31:03.720
So I'm looking forward to V.

01:31:03.720 --> 01:31:04.720
Spazinator wants to know,

01:31:04.720 --> 01:31:07.720
How about the apparent leak by Naughty Dog on the official PS boards

01:31:07.720 --> 01:31:11.720
regarding cross-game chat coming to the PS3 in Firmware 3.1?

01:31:11.720 --> 01:31:14.720
Well, you kind of summed it up right there what the news story is,

01:31:14.720 --> 01:31:16.720
and all I have to say is I hope so.

01:31:16.720 --> 01:31:19.720
Sadly, as much as I've said nice things about Sony tonight,

01:31:19.720 --> 01:31:24.720
I think that they're still lagging big time in the online war.

01:31:24.720 --> 01:31:27.720
But they're free, so I guess you get what you pay for,

01:31:27.720 --> 01:31:28.720
but this would be nice.

01:31:28.720 --> 01:31:29.720
It's certainly a nice feature.

01:31:29.720 --> 01:31:32.720
I mean, of course it would be. Yeah.

01:31:32.720 --> 01:31:33.720
Let's see.

01:31:33.720 --> 01:31:34.720
Gamer Girl asks,

01:31:34.720 --> 01:31:36.720
What's the most fun game you've ever played?

01:31:36.720 --> 01:31:40.720
Like, so fun that when it's over you'd play it a million times no matter what.

01:31:40.720 --> 01:31:43.720
Oh, my gosh.

01:31:43.720 --> 01:31:47.720
I don't know if I want to go like 8-bit or like newer stuff.

01:31:47.720 --> 01:31:49.720
I can always play the Guardian Legends.

01:31:49.720 --> 01:31:51.720
You know I talk about that game very fondly on the show,

01:31:51.720 --> 01:31:52.720
and I love that game.

01:31:52.720 --> 01:31:54.720
I can always go back to that.

01:31:54.720 --> 01:31:57.720
If you want to go to a true 80s arcade classic, Dig Dug.

01:31:57.720 --> 01:31:58.720
I can never stop playing Dig Dug.

01:31:58.720 --> 01:31:59.720
Peggle.

01:31:59.720 --> 01:32:00.720
Peggle.

01:32:00.720 --> 01:32:01.720
Seriously.

01:32:01.720 --> 01:32:06.720
No, it's like whenever anything happens and I have to wait for anything,

01:32:06.720 --> 01:32:07.720
I'm like Peggle.

01:32:07.720 --> 01:32:09.720
Seriously, it's all Peggle for me right now.

01:32:09.720 --> 01:32:11.720
Mr. Dew.

01:32:11.720 --> 01:32:15.720
Mr. Dew is Snow Brothers.

01:32:15.720 --> 01:32:17.720
And soon, President Cat.

01:32:17.720 --> 01:32:19.720
Mr. Dew is rad.

01:32:19.720 --> 01:32:21.720
Redertainment asks,

01:32:21.720 --> 01:32:23.720
I have a big pile of strategy guides I want to get rid of.

01:32:23.720 --> 01:32:26.720
Suggestions?

01:32:26.720 --> 01:32:31.720
If you have the versus Final Fantasy 7 one and it still has the poster in it

01:32:31.720 --> 01:32:33.720
and it's intact, give it to me.

01:32:33.720 --> 01:32:35.720
Also, winner is coming.

01:32:35.720 --> 01:32:37.720
Because I don't want to pay $100 for it on eBay.

01:32:37.720 --> 01:32:39.720
I had that poster, but my drunk girlfriend kicked it

01:32:39.720 --> 01:32:42.720
and it accidentally ripped.

01:32:42.720 --> 01:32:44.720
I had the strategy guide and poster and everything

01:32:44.720 --> 01:32:48.720
and Dan's friend ripped the cover and drew on it.

01:32:48.720 --> 01:32:49.720
It was a long time ago.

01:32:49.720 --> 01:32:50.720
I'm pissed off.

01:32:50.720 --> 01:32:53.720
That particular strategy guide goes for a lot of money on eBay.

01:32:53.720 --> 01:32:55.720
Seriously.

01:32:55.720 --> 01:32:57.720
The versus books Final Fantasy 7 one.

01:32:57.720 --> 01:32:59.720
Rina, we just responded to you, Jamie.

01:32:59.720 --> 01:33:00.720
Oh, Lord.

01:33:00.720 --> 01:33:02.720
She's busy tonight.

01:33:02.720 --> 01:33:03.720
Sorry.

01:33:03.720 --> 01:33:05.720
It's taking over Twitter tonight.

01:33:05.720 --> 01:33:07.720
I can't help it.

01:33:07.720 --> 01:33:09.720
Anyway, that's going to do it for Twitter topics tonight.

01:33:09.720 --> 01:33:11.720
Sorry if you guys didn't get through.

01:33:11.720 --> 01:33:12.720
Don't forget, you can always send us an email.

01:33:12.720 --> 01:33:14.720
Mailbag at OrangeLawnsRadio.com

01:33:14.720 --> 01:33:17.720
and if you're really upset your tweet didn't get through,

01:33:17.720 --> 01:33:21.720
blame President Cat because that's been monopolizing our Twitter discussion this evening.

01:33:21.720 --> 01:33:22.720
I love it.

01:33:22.720 --> 01:33:24.720
It's got a cat licking its nose.

01:33:24.720 --> 01:33:26.720
It's so cute.

01:33:26.720 --> 01:33:27.720
Exactly.

01:33:27.720 --> 01:33:29.720
How about some other gaming news?

01:33:29.720 --> 01:33:31.720
Loki.

01:33:31.720 --> 01:33:33.720
I don't know if I could do any more gaming news.

01:33:33.720 --> 01:33:36.720
It just feels so insignificant compared to President Cat.

01:33:36.720 --> 01:33:38.720
But anyways, we'll move on.

01:33:38.720 --> 01:33:45.720
So apparently people are getting banned for playing pirated copies of Forza and Borderlands.

01:33:45.720 --> 01:33:47.720
Really?

01:33:47.720 --> 01:33:54.720
Is that a shock to you that playing games that you've burned early is going to get you banned off Xbox Live?

01:33:54.720 --> 01:33:56.720
But yeah, that's the case.

01:33:56.720 --> 01:34:00.720
So apparently if you are going to go the illegal route with Forza Motorsport 3 and Borderlands,

01:34:00.720 --> 01:34:02.720
you might want to wait until the game comes out.

01:34:02.720 --> 01:34:11.720
Ironically though, you're going to get banned, but only your live account is going to get banned,

01:34:11.720 --> 01:34:14.720
not your console because they still want you to buy games apparently.

01:34:14.720 --> 01:34:16.720
But you can always create a new live account.

01:34:16.720 --> 01:34:20.720
Or if you're really going to play this that early, just play it offline.

01:34:20.720 --> 01:34:23.720
Or play it on a banned console.

01:34:23.720 --> 01:34:28.720
I heard though they banned the account and not the console.

01:34:28.720 --> 01:34:29.720
Yeah, the account.

01:34:29.720 --> 01:34:33.720
In some way they knew whether you're playing a legit game or not.

01:34:33.720 --> 01:34:39.720
I almost picked up Borderlands early too, but I figured I wouldn't get to it because I'd be playing DJ Hero.

01:34:39.720 --> 01:34:41.720
And that's really what's going to happen.

01:34:41.720 --> 01:34:45.720
I'm going to wait for Borderlands to come out because I don't know when I'm going to get to it.

01:34:45.720 --> 01:34:52.720
And really that's the last game I'm buying this year, so I'm all set for the rest of the holiday.

01:34:52.720 --> 01:34:58.720
I'll just cozy up, no fire, but I'll cozy up in my warm house and DJ Hero and Borderlands.

01:34:58.720 --> 01:35:02.720
How though, because they say that you're not going to get banned if you have it legitimately,

01:35:02.720 --> 01:35:04.720
but seriously, how do they know the difference?

01:35:04.720 --> 01:35:07.720
I don't know.

01:35:07.720 --> 01:35:11.720
But a lot of people are probably going to be surprised when that fall update rolls around.

01:35:11.720 --> 01:35:14.720
Everyone playing burned copies of stuff.

01:35:14.720 --> 01:35:16.720
I hope none of my consoles get banned.

01:35:16.720 --> 01:35:17.720
Interesting.

01:35:17.720 --> 01:35:23.720
Of course, ironically enough, and this is kind of off topic, but since I have modded consoles,

01:35:23.720 --> 01:35:25.720
I'll go ahead and talk about it.

01:35:25.720 --> 01:35:30.720
It's not even really the fact that they're modded, it's the fact that they're older generation consoles.

01:35:30.720 --> 01:35:37.720
I've had a 100% failure rate with Xbox 360s, the first generation of them.

01:35:37.720 --> 01:35:45.720
And I have another one that's dead, or that's going to die, it's freezing up now.

01:35:45.720 --> 01:35:48.720
And it was actually one that Microsoft repaired.

01:35:48.720 --> 01:35:52.720
Of course, I went and modded it, so now they can't repair it again.

01:35:52.720 --> 01:36:01.720
But the new arcade systems, when they have the HDMI ports and stuff on them, those live, sort of.

01:36:01.720 --> 01:36:04.720
It's just the older ones do not.

01:36:04.720 --> 01:36:12.720
My sister's console, which I actually have a new one coming for her, the video died on it, which sucks.

01:36:12.720 --> 01:36:17.720
But the one console though that is dying right now, I'm going to probably take some of the fix.

01:36:17.720 --> 01:36:20.720
And I'm going to take the other one too, just to see if they can fix that one.

01:36:20.720 --> 01:36:23.720
Because that's a different error, but we'll see.

01:36:23.720 --> 01:36:28.720
But god damn it, seriously, talk about crappy hardware.

01:36:28.720 --> 01:36:31.720
Although I love them.

01:36:31.720 --> 01:36:35.720
And their console's good, and I will buy another one.

01:36:35.720 --> 01:36:37.720
Because I'm a sucker like that.

01:36:37.720 --> 01:36:41.720
Because Grand Theft Auto IV is awesome, and I have to mod it.

01:36:41.720 --> 01:36:44.720
Well now, I'd be curious to know if Loki's going to buy this.

01:36:44.720 --> 01:36:49.720
It's something for the Wii that has nothing to do with President Cat, but it does have to do with an exercise bike.

01:36:49.720 --> 01:36:54.720
Now, I seem to remember on the show a couple weeks ago, we were talking about some type of patent for an exercise bike.

01:36:54.720 --> 01:36:58.720
Well, it wasn't a patent, it was a leaked, like, advertisement.

01:36:58.720 --> 01:37:03.720
Well, it looks like this has come to fruition, because Cyberbike Cycling Sports is coming out.

01:37:03.720 --> 01:37:06.720
But here's the thing, it's not from Nintendo.

01:37:06.720 --> 01:37:12.720
It's coming from publisher Big Ben, and it comes with a, yes, full-size exercise bike controller.

01:37:12.720 --> 01:37:17.720
And apparently it's very easy to set up, it has an adjustable saddle, it has handlebars and all this.

01:37:17.720 --> 01:37:23.720
It's also compatible with Mario Kart Wii, go figure, but the game that comes with it is called Cyberbike.

01:37:23.720 --> 01:37:26.720
It's supposed to come out in 2010.

01:37:26.720 --> 01:37:28.720
It looks stupid.

01:37:28.720 --> 01:37:34.720
Okay, the other one, which looked pretty ridiculous to begin with, you know, had a smaller peripheral.

01:37:34.720 --> 01:37:38.720
I mean, I could understand maybe having that, because that's a little bit smaller.

01:37:38.720 --> 01:37:43.720
You know, maybe there's some games that might use it later on, but this is a full fucking exercise bike.

01:37:43.720 --> 01:37:50.720
You do not need an exercise bike to go with the damn game, just buy an exercise bike if you're gonna buy an exercise bike.

01:37:52.720 --> 01:37:58.720
Alright, um, moving on, DarkSakura.

01:37:58.720 --> 01:38:01.720
Oh yes, I'm sorry, I'm still, uh...

01:38:01.720 --> 01:38:03.720
No, I know, I'm so distracted with the Rina We thing, too.

01:38:03.720 --> 01:38:05.720
They just, they said something again, to you.

01:38:05.720 --> 01:38:06.720
To me?

01:38:06.720 --> 01:38:09.720
I see, I'm a little confused now, many follower in English.

01:38:09.720 --> 01:38:11.720
Oh, oh, gur, my poor English.

01:38:11.720 --> 01:38:18.720
I almost feel bad, because they've got to be overwhelmed right now, because Twitter only had like 80 followers, which is fucking criminal.

01:38:18.720 --> 01:38:19.720
Yeah.

01:38:19.720 --> 01:38:25.720
And they've already got like 20 new followers throughout the show tonight, and it's probably going to continue to grow as people listen to this podcast.

01:38:25.720 --> 01:38:27.720
Please go follow them.

01:38:27.720 --> 01:38:33.720
They are feeling like probably a little overwhelmed at this whole thing, but people need to know, cats are adorable, dammit.

01:38:33.720 --> 01:38:34.720
I know.

01:38:34.720 --> 01:38:36.720
So if we're distracted tonight, sorry, this is...

01:38:36.720 --> 01:38:43.720
If Keyboard Cat can be as popular as it is, if Keyboard Cat can get referenced in Scribblenauts, there is no reason.

01:38:43.720 --> 01:38:52.720
Okay, if they can put out all these stupid party games that don't sell maybe a thousand copies, you know, they just, they're crappy, crappy, crappy, cheap ass party games.

01:38:52.720 --> 01:38:54.720
Why the hell can't they port this over?

01:38:54.720 --> 01:39:04.720
They port all these, you know, UK games that are like, absolutely not popular at all, like these franchises I've never heard of before.

01:39:04.720 --> 01:39:07.720
And I can't get a goddamn cat playing a fucking piano.

01:39:07.720 --> 01:39:12.720
Exactly, why can't they put out a cute cat game?

01:39:12.720 --> 01:39:19.720
Alright, sj100matt in chat, speaking of the last story, says, wait, Mr. Garrison's Wild Wacky Action Bike, the game?

01:39:19.720 --> 01:39:25.720
No, it's not that kind of peripheral, but I bet with a little duct tape, you can achieve anything.

01:39:25.720 --> 01:39:26.720
If you want.

01:39:26.720 --> 01:39:33.720
Question is, Rob, how quick before someone tries to put their penis in it?

01:39:33.720 --> 01:39:39.720
That is always the quintessential question here on Orange Launch Radio, how quick before someone tries to put their penis in it.

01:39:39.720 --> 01:39:48.720
And the exercise bike, not long, I mean, I don't know really where you would put your penis, but I'm sure somewhere it'll happen.

01:39:48.720 --> 01:39:55.720
Alright, anyhow, sorry, Darsakura, we keep interrupting, I know you're trying to correspond with Rina Wee, but there is a show still to be done.

01:39:55.720 --> 01:39:59.720
I'm just saying, thank you for being patient with us, I wish I knew better Japanese.

01:39:59.720 --> 01:40:18.720
Well, back to Nintendo, Miyamoto has actually brought back a little bit more conversation in regards to HD Wee, by saying that they want to support new technology as it comes out.

01:40:18.720 --> 01:40:27.720
And he's actually even saying that if he was a consumer that had an HDTV, he'd want to play his games with nice graphics too.

01:40:27.720 --> 01:40:38.720
So they're actually going to be moving with it as HD technology becomes more and more prevalent, which really it is, I mean, you know what I mean?

01:40:38.720 --> 01:41:03.720
But they are pretty adamant that they're going to focus on gameplay, but not close the door on HD. In fact, there's actually some financial analysts already that are saying that it's definitely going to happen this summer.

01:41:03.720 --> 01:41:11.720
And I think that it's... I don't really know how they're going to do it, other than add-ons, but...

01:41:11.720 --> 01:41:19.720
Well, I think, you know, we've been saying on this show for some time, the Super Wee or the Wee HD that will be backwards compatible with the original...

01:41:19.720 --> 01:41:20.720
The Wee Double D!

01:41:20.720 --> 01:41:34.720
The Wee with four eyes or something, Will, is inevitable. It's going to happen. I think the question is, when? And certainly, you know, summer 2010, I don't need a mega expensive analyst to tell me that.

01:41:34.720 --> 01:41:42.720
I mean, I think I said that on the show months ago, that it's probably going to happen. Of course, I also called it for this year, so I'm not always right, but this is why I do the show for free.

01:41:42.720 --> 01:41:54.720
But the one question, we'll let have President Cat. No, but seriously, I mean, Wee HD, is now the time or is everybody just getting over-anxious because Wee HD is what they want?

01:41:54.720 --> 01:41:59.720
Loki, I'm especially curious to hear from you. I know you're doing other stuff, but I'm kind of curious what you think.

01:41:59.720 --> 01:42:05.720
I don't want another Wee HD. I'm finding my Wee right now.

01:42:05.720 --> 01:42:08.720
Is that just because you don't want to spend more money or what's the deal?

01:42:08.720 --> 01:42:19.720
No, I don't think money is an option. Really, it's just the problem is I'm so jaded by what they've done so far with the Wee. Why do I really want to go through the gamble again?

01:42:19.720 --> 01:42:21.720
Because tonight we have seen its potential.

01:42:21.720 --> 01:42:32.720
Listen, OK, I am checking my bank account. Why am I checking my bank account? Because I am buying President Cat. This purchase is imminent, OK? It's happening.

01:42:32.720 --> 01:42:42.720
I'm buying it, too. I'm buying it, too. I don't even have a thing that can play it, but I'm going to buy it. Why? Because I don't know. Don't fucking judge me. I just want it.

01:42:42.720 --> 01:42:47.720
I will look at the manual and purr at it or something. I don't know. Someday my Wee will play it.

01:42:47.720 --> 01:42:52.720
You want to pay for the massage for me? You can get me President Cat.

01:42:52.720 --> 01:42:56.720
Plus, I oddly want to support this.

01:42:56.720 --> 01:42:57.720
I do, too.

01:42:57.720 --> 01:42:59.720
I hope the game doesn't stink.

01:42:59.720 --> 01:43:00.720
Oh, yeah.

01:43:00.720 --> 01:43:07.720
I don't care if it stinks or not. The whole fun is going to be the whole novelty.

01:43:07.720 --> 01:43:16.720
Keep in mind, it's taken me a long time to actually sit and read the blog, just the little comics of the cat, but it's freaking funny.

01:43:16.720 --> 01:43:21.720
Cat's like, why am I on your t-shirt? Pat, pat, pat.

01:43:21.720 --> 01:43:32.720
I don't know if you guys heard me laughing earlier. Keep in mind, I probably read on a five-year-old level in Japanese.

01:43:32.720 --> 01:43:39.720
Which is probably the perfect age of what this game is geared towards, yet we're all sitting here going, eee, cats, eee.

01:43:39.720 --> 01:43:41.720
You notice who's not in the room.

01:43:41.720 --> 01:43:42.720
Who?

01:43:42.720 --> 01:43:48.720
Shermie. Shermie's like, screw all you, I'm gone.

01:43:48.720 --> 01:43:54.720
Anyhow, Wii HD, I think it's going to happen. It'll be backwards compatible with all the Wii games.

01:43:54.720 --> 01:43:58.720
It's just a matter of when. We know it. It's a must.

01:43:58.720 --> 01:44:01.720
Oh, they replied and said, I wish I knew better English, too.

01:44:01.720 --> 01:44:05.720
Aww. I just want to hug them.

01:44:05.720 --> 01:44:09.720
You know, I am supposed to go to Japan next year. I should offer to come give her a hug, or him.

01:44:09.720 --> 01:44:12.720
I don't care. I'll hug them, whoever they are.

01:44:12.720 --> 01:44:14.720
Anyhow, Loki.

01:44:14.720 --> 01:44:16.720
Oh, I'm sorry.

01:44:16.720 --> 01:44:22.720
So, speaking of Xbox 360 updates and possible bannings of people and stuff like that.

01:44:22.720 --> 01:44:27.720
There is another update that's going to ban stuff, and that will be, of course, the fall update.

01:44:27.720 --> 01:44:31.720
It will be banning unauthorized memory units.

01:44:31.720 --> 01:44:37.720
Yes, you may remember we talked a little bit about max memory units being put out by, I believe, Datel.

01:44:37.720 --> 01:44:48.720
These will allow you to use a micro SD card and support it up to 2GB to 4GB of memory.

01:44:48.720 --> 01:44:52.720
Which is awesome, because the Microsoft memory units are really fucking expensive.

01:44:52.720 --> 01:44:59.720
For like $50 or $40, you get a 512MB memory unit, which is ridiculous.

01:44:59.720 --> 01:45:06.720
Especially since, hell, you can get a USB drive for nothing.

01:45:06.720 --> 01:45:12.720
So, being the greedy bastards that they are, they decided, hey, you know what?

01:45:12.720 --> 01:45:16.720
We don't want you to sell this, and so we're going to block it.

01:45:16.720 --> 01:45:19.720
So if you bought it, you're shit out of luck.

01:45:19.720 --> 01:45:22.720
And there's nothing you can do about it.

01:45:22.720 --> 01:45:25.720
But people are pissed, but Microsoft says, who gives a shit?

01:45:25.720 --> 01:45:29.720
It's our console, we'll do what we want, nah nah nah nah nah.

01:45:29.720 --> 01:45:32.720
I'm kind of on the fence with this. I think they...

01:45:32.720 --> 01:45:34.720
They have the right to do it, but it's a dick move.

01:45:34.720 --> 01:45:38.720
Yeah, it's a cock block move, is what they're doing.

01:45:38.720 --> 01:45:43.720
And it kind of sucks, because the person who loses here is the consumer.

01:45:43.720 --> 01:45:45.720
Not the developer of this memory unit.

01:45:45.720 --> 01:45:48.720
They already made the money from selling it to the consumer.

01:45:48.720 --> 01:45:50.720
It's the consumer who's shit out of luck.

01:45:50.720 --> 01:45:56.720
But, if I'm understanding this right, this isn't aimed so much as things that might be in stores.

01:45:56.720 --> 01:45:59.720
Because there aren't a lot of these unauthorised things in stores.

01:45:59.720 --> 01:46:03.720
This is aimed at people trying to jerry-rig hard drives to do everything, right?

01:46:03.720 --> 01:46:10.720
This is aimed at... Well, these devices are aimed at just the consumer, but it's a cheaper alternative with more memory.

01:46:10.720 --> 01:46:12.720
But it's not being offered by Microsoft.

01:46:12.720 --> 01:46:16.720
And so, therefore, it goes away.

01:46:16.720 --> 01:46:19.720
It's the same reason why there's no third-party hard drives.

01:46:19.720 --> 01:46:22.720
Because, I can tell you this much, hard drives are damn cheap.

01:46:22.720 --> 01:46:28.720
And especially these drives they're offering for $150, you can get a terabyte drive for $150.

01:46:28.720 --> 01:46:34.720
So, I guess that's true. Yeah, I think Microsoft does kind of rip off a little bit with their storage.

01:46:34.720 --> 01:46:37.720
But this is, you know...

01:46:37.720 --> 01:46:43.720
You know what's really disturbing is the whole wireless adapter.

01:46:43.720 --> 01:46:45.720
You want to talk about how they really rip people off.

01:46:45.720 --> 01:46:49.720
I hope they don't block out my wireless adapter just because it's not an official Microsoft one.

01:46:49.720 --> 01:46:51.720
No, that they can't because it's USB powered.

01:46:51.720 --> 01:46:54.720
And the wireless adapters, I mean, it's just by Ethernet.

01:46:54.720 --> 01:46:59.720
They can't block that because it's not USB or... Well, the memory units are technically kind of USB,

01:46:59.720 --> 01:47:02.720
but it's like some weird setup.

01:47:02.720 --> 01:47:05.720
So, they can block it by the device ID.

01:47:05.720 --> 01:47:07.720
Same with controllers if they want to.

01:47:07.720 --> 01:47:11.720
I think they could block controllers that way too, but they don't.

01:47:11.720 --> 01:47:16.720
Alright, but the thing is though, when the new 250GB hard drives come out,

01:47:16.720 --> 01:47:24.720
there are ways out there to make your own hard drive for the 360 by modifying a laptop hard drive.

01:47:24.720 --> 01:47:27.720
So, if you want to go through the trouble, you can do that for cheaper.

01:47:27.720 --> 01:47:30.720
And now you can do it up to 250GB.

01:47:30.720 --> 01:47:32.720
Amazing.

01:47:32.720 --> 01:47:35.720
Moving on to another story about the Wii.

01:47:35.720 --> 01:47:39.720
I want to talk about New Super Mario Brothers Wii and the whole demo play.

01:47:39.720 --> 01:47:41.720
Remember this was very controversial.

01:47:41.720 --> 01:47:43.720
We've talked about it in an extent on the show.

01:47:43.720 --> 01:47:48.720
This is the whole, when you pause the game, you can have it play for you to get through certain parts of the game.

01:47:48.720 --> 01:47:52.720
Well, now details have emerged on how it actually works.

01:47:52.720 --> 01:47:54.720
So, see what you guys think of this, okay?

01:47:54.720 --> 01:47:58.720
The mode is actually called Super Guide, okay?

01:47:58.720 --> 01:48:02.720
And it doesn't really work exactly the way people think it would.

01:48:02.720 --> 01:48:07.720
What happens is that if you die 8 times on one of the stages, there's 80 stages in the game,

01:48:07.720 --> 01:48:13.720
if you die 8 times, then what happens is that you'll have a chance to hit a green Super Guide block.

01:48:13.720 --> 01:48:17.720
What will happen is that then a video is going to show up, Luigi plays through the stage.

01:48:17.720 --> 01:48:21.720
It's not going to show you hidden paths, it's not going to show you hidden coins,

01:48:21.720 --> 01:48:23.720
it just kind of shows you how to get through the stage.

01:48:23.720 --> 01:48:25.720
It will show you how the stage could be completed.

01:48:25.720 --> 01:48:29.720
At any time, the player can jump in and take over,

01:48:29.720 --> 01:48:34.720
and then the game basically will have played you through the parts you can't get through.

01:48:34.720 --> 01:48:40.720
If you want, though, you can just let the game complete the level for you and move on to the next stage.

01:48:40.720 --> 01:48:44.720
Now, Miyamoto has said there are some disadvantages to using Super Guide.

01:48:44.720 --> 01:48:47.720
If you decide not to use the Super Guide at all during the game,

01:48:47.720 --> 01:48:50.720
you stay away from the blocks and don't use them, you get something special.

01:48:50.720 --> 01:48:52.720
Of course, that could be anything.

01:48:52.720 --> 01:48:54.720
Could that be something new on the title screen?

01:48:54.720 --> 01:48:56.720
Could it be an unlockable character?

01:48:56.720 --> 01:48:57.720
Who knows what that could be.

01:48:57.720 --> 01:48:59.720
But if you rely on them, you're going to miss out.

01:48:59.720 --> 01:49:05.720
And, of course, just the whole morale of the fact you had to use the Super Guide to beat the level.

01:49:05.720 --> 01:49:11.720
A quote from Miyamoto in a little article that is running on Destructoid right now,

01:49:11.720 --> 01:49:14.720
I find that when the Super Guide block does appear,

01:49:14.720 --> 01:49:17.720
I kind of feel regretful and guilty that I've let that happen.

01:49:17.720 --> 01:49:19.720
So I've often found that playing the game, when that happens,

01:49:19.720 --> 01:49:21.720
it kind of inspires me to say,

01:49:21.720 --> 01:49:24.720
I've already done this bad, now I have to clear the level on my own.

01:49:24.720 --> 01:49:29.720
So, you know, I guess they're saying that you just feel a general sense of,

01:49:29.720 --> 01:49:32.720
well, you cheated to beat the level in order to actually get through it.

01:49:32.720 --> 01:49:35.720
So, I don't know, what do you guys think?

01:49:35.720 --> 01:49:37.720
Now that you hear the details on how this actually works,

01:49:37.720 --> 01:49:41.720
that it's a brick that appears if you die eight times, what do you think?

01:49:41.720 --> 01:49:44.720
Is it still a joke? Is it useful?

01:49:44.720 --> 01:49:49.720
It's got a use for it, but, you know, at the same time, it's kind of, I don't know.

01:49:49.720 --> 01:49:53.720
I've stopped caring, basically, I think is what it is.

01:49:53.720 --> 01:49:56.720
It's like, it was fun to complain about and stuff like that a while ago,

01:49:56.720 --> 01:50:02.720
but they've just hired me out, so I just don't care anymore.

01:50:02.720 --> 01:50:06.720
And on top of that, I'll have you know that I've already placed my order for President Cat,

01:50:06.720 --> 01:50:07.720
which will be here shortly after-

01:50:07.720 --> 01:50:08.720
High five! High five!

01:50:08.720 --> 01:50:10.720
Shortly after street date, yes.

01:50:10.720 --> 01:50:14.720
To play on my modded Wii that will take games from any region.

01:50:14.720 --> 01:50:16.720
That means we need the camera next week.

01:50:16.720 --> 01:50:21.720
I just sent them a message saying, you know, that I'm one of the hosts

01:50:21.720 --> 01:50:25.720
and that I have a friend that speaks Japanese who I can probably get to translate for us.

01:50:25.720 --> 01:50:29.720
So, we've got several friends in Japan. We've got several listeners in Japan.

01:50:29.720 --> 01:50:33.720
See if she could write a story for our website.

01:50:33.720 --> 01:50:36.720
Like, just an interview. Interview them for a story on the website or something.

01:50:36.720 --> 01:50:37.720
I'll talk to her.

01:50:37.720 --> 01:50:41.720
Yeah, please do. I don't know if that would interest her at all, but that would be amazing.

01:50:41.720 --> 01:50:42.720
All right.

01:50:42.720 --> 01:50:43.720
President Cat!

01:50:43.720 --> 01:50:47.720
Let's get some comments from our chat room.

01:50:47.720 --> 01:50:52.720
Let's see. Gameguru says, problem with Wii HD coming out before the next Xbox or Playstation

01:50:52.720 --> 01:50:56.720
is that it won't be graphically on par with them and won't initially have the Wii's fan base.

01:50:56.720 --> 01:51:00.720
That's going back to a previous news story, but that's okay because I know there's a little delay.

01:51:00.720 --> 01:51:04.720
XLink calls this Super Cheater 5000 is the name of the device.

01:51:04.720 --> 01:51:07.720
You know, again, I think we have to remember the audience this is aimed at.

01:51:07.720 --> 01:51:14.720
And I think for the casual player, this is, you know, going to be a good thing.

01:51:14.720 --> 01:51:15.720
But I think for the rest of us,

01:51:15.720 --> 01:51:20.720
I do really like the fact that you at least get some unlockable if you don't do it.

01:51:20.720 --> 01:51:24.720
I just hope that unlockable carries some weight a little bit.

01:51:24.720 --> 01:51:27.720
You know, unfortunately, Wii doesn't have anything like achievements,

01:51:27.720 --> 01:51:32.720
so hopefully it'll have some type of E-peen that you can show other people

01:51:32.720 --> 01:51:35.720
because who doesn't like to stroke their E-peen?

01:51:35.720 --> 01:51:37.720
DarkSakura, don't you love to stroke your E-peen?

01:51:37.720 --> 01:51:38.720
Yeah.

01:51:38.720 --> 01:51:41.720
All right. One way DarkSakura likes to stroke her E-peen is every week she'll open up the mailbag

01:51:41.720 --> 01:51:45.720
and read some emails from our listeners at mailbagatorangelaungeradio.com.

01:51:45.720 --> 01:51:49.720
So DarkSakura, please open up the mailbag.

01:51:49.720 --> 01:51:51.720
There wasn't very much when I looked in there earlier, but maybe there is now.

01:51:51.720 --> 01:51:52.720
There's one.

01:51:52.720 --> 01:51:53.720
One email.

01:51:53.720 --> 01:51:54.720
From J-Rod.

01:51:54.720 --> 01:51:57.720
All right. Well, let's read it tonight in tonight's mailbag segment.

01:51:57.720 --> 01:52:01.720
And we'll just have to roll anything that comes in now to next week.

01:52:01.720 --> 01:52:02.720
President Cat.

01:52:02.720 --> 01:52:05.720
I anticipate we're going to have a lot of President Cat emails this week, but we'll see.

01:52:05.720 --> 01:52:07.720
Hello, OLR crew.

01:52:07.720 --> 01:52:13.720
I currently listen to the latest podcast on the feed where Rob and Loki completely trash the PSP Go.

01:52:13.720 --> 01:52:20.720
What everyone who bad mouths the PSP Go needs to realize is that maybe the PSP Go is supposed to be a new PSP owner purchase and not an upgrade.

01:52:20.720 --> 01:52:27.720
I never had a PSP before, but seeing all the stuff on PSN and the new PSP Go pushed me over the edge to get one finally.

01:52:27.720 --> 01:52:31.720
It is a sleek portable, and the sliding screen looks cool as hell.

01:52:31.720 --> 01:52:40.720
Now, if I owned an older PSP, of course I wouldn't buy the PSP Go the same way I wouldn't buy a DSi if I owned a Lite or a Phat.

01:52:40.720 --> 01:52:46.720
I honestly don't think the PSP Go is even aimed at the current PSP owners, but new customers like myself.

01:52:46.720 --> 01:52:50.720
So really, no need to take a shit on it. Just don't buy it and enjoy your current PSPs.

01:52:50.720 --> 01:52:54.720
This email sponsored by the Olive Garden, home of the River Reading Salad and Breadsticks.

01:52:54.720 --> 01:52:56.720
Um, I will say this.

01:52:56.720 --> 01:52:57.720
And this is me.

01:52:57.720 --> 01:52:59.720
Okay, this is just me.

01:52:59.720 --> 01:53:13.720
If I was a new customer, and I was told to pick one to buy, if they were all the same price, I would pick the 3,000.

01:53:13.720 --> 01:53:15.720
I wouldn't get a Go.

01:53:15.720 --> 01:53:19.720
And we've said on this show that the PSP 3,000 is a great system. It's pretty cool.

01:53:19.720 --> 01:53:23.720
And the thing is, I don't understand why you would pay more money for a system that does less, basically.

01:53:23.720 --> 01:53:25.720
That's my question.

01:53:25.720 --> 01:53:30.720
I'm not even talking about people that own a PlayStation Portable already, because there's no reason they need another system.

01:53:30.720 --> 01:53:32.720
I don't understand that at all, why would you buy another one.

01:53:32.720 --> 01:53:40.720
Why I said that, because I actually have two PSPs, but the 2,000 actually had a little bit more RAM and stuff like that, and it was a little bit different.

01:53:40.720 --> 01:53:44.720
The 3,000 has a built-in microphone and whatnot, so that's alright.

01:53:44.720 --> 01:53:49.720
But, the fact is, the 3,000 is cheaper.

01:53:49.720 --> 01:53:51.720
It plays the same downloadable games.

01:53:51.720 --> 01:53:55.720
Plus, you have the option now to purchase games that are on UMD.

01:53:55.720 --> 01:53:59.720
Plus, you can get memory units and stuff like that for it.

01:53:59.720 --> 01:54:01.720
Yes, it doesn't have built-in memory, but you know what?

01:54:01.720 --> 01:54:07.720
Memory is cheap, so it's not really worth paying the extra money for memory that's in the system.

01:54:07.720 --> 01:54:13.720
And that sliding screen may look cool and stuff, but at the same time, I'm wondering how soon that's going to break.

01:54:13.720 --> 01:54:23.720
I do give them credit for the fact that they have the ability to sync up your DualShock 3 controller with it to play games when you have it hooked up to your TV.

01:54:23.720 --> 01:54:29.720
I can't say that I've actually used that function on my PSP 2,000.

01:54:29.720 --> 01:54:35.720
I mean, I've played games on TV before, but maybe once or twice to see it and check it out.

01:54:35.720 --> 01:54:40.720
I don't understand why you would pay more money for a system that does less.

01:54:40.720 --> 01:54:42.720
That's basically my argument.

01:54:42.720 --> 01:54:50.720
But hey, if you want to, and if you think it's a cool-looking system or whatever, more power to you.

01:54:50.720 --> 01:54:52.720
I got to try one.

01:54:52.720 --> 01:54:57.720
A guy in my art history class had one.

01:54:57.720 --> 01:55:02.720
Well, I didn't really sit and play on anything, but he let me hold it and push the buttons.

01:55:02.720 --> 01:55:05.720
And I have to say that it really felt flimsy.

01:55:05.720 --> 01:55:08.720
It felt really cheap.

01:55:08.720 --> 01:55:13.720
My iPhone weighs more, and of course I have an old iPhone, but it weighs more than the PSP Go.

01:55:13.720 --> 01:55:16.720
And the plastic just felt like poor quality.

01:55:16.720 --> 01:55:22.720
I just really felt like if I had a moment of frustration and gripped it too tightly that I would break it.

01:55:22.720 --> 01:55:26.720
I really had the feeling that it was fragile.

01:55:26.720 --> 01:55:31.720
I want to take a quick poll in here because I want to kind of address the Sony people for a minute.

01:55:31.720 --> 01:55:35.720
Because especially in reading some of the reviews on Twitter and so forth.

01:55:35.720 --> 01:55:39.720
I'm sorry, not Twitter. Twitter's on my mind tonight because of everything else going on.

01:55:39.720 --> 01:55:41.720
But on iTunes and everything.

01:55:41.720 --> 01:55:45.720
People have been unnecessarily harsh to our program because they think we're slanted against Sony.

01:55:45.720 --> 01:55:48.720
And I want to make it very clear, it's not the case.

01:55:48.720 --> 01:55:50.720
We haze people when they deserve to be hazed.

01:55:50.720 --> 01:55:52.720
And I want to prove that here with something.

01:55:52.720 --> 01:55:57.720
And I'm not saying this particular emailer is a part of that because I know he's emailed us a bunch about various topics.

01:55:57.720 --> 01:56:00.720
But I'm just saying, hold on a minute, because it works both ways here.

01:56:00.720 --> 01:56:02.720
Quick poll of the room.

01:56:02.720 --> 01:56:06.720
How many of you own a DSi?

01:56:06.720 --> 01:56:09.720
No. I don't. I don't. Exactly.

01:56:09.720 --> 01:56:11.720
None of us own a DSi either.

01:56:11.720 --> 01:56:13.720
And for many of the same reasons.

01:56:13.720 --> 01:56:16.720
Because what's the difference between a DS and a DSi?

01:56:16.720 --> 01:56:18.720
It has a camera. It has a camera.

01:56:18.720 --> 01:56:21.720
I'll get a DSi when there are more specific DSi games.

01:56:21.720 --> 01:56:25.720
But other than that, there's no legitimate reason for me to have a DSi.

01:56:25.720 --> 01:56:29.720
It's got a camera with it and the price points are pretty similar.

01:56:29.720 --> 01:56:33.720
But at the same time, it doesn't warrant me purchasing another system that plays the same games, basically.

01:56:33.720 --> 01:56:37.720
They put out a camera on the old Game Boy Color.

01:56:37.720 --> 01:56:39.720
Guess who didn't buy one? Me.

01:56:39.720 --> 01:56:41.720
Eddie is saying two cameras.

01:56:41.720 --> 01:56:43.720
But here's something else to consider.

01:56:43.720 --> 01:56:46.720
If I remember right, the DSi got rid of the Game Boy Advance slot, too.

01:56:46.720 --> 01:56:47.720
Exactly.

01:56:47.720 --> 01:56:48.720
So you can't play games.

01:56:48.720 --> 01:56:49.720
Less functionality.

01:56:49.720 --> 01:56:54.720
So it's, in a way, almost just as bad as the PSP Go and the PSP 3000.

01:56:54.720 --> 01:56:57.720
Here's my question that is not really being answered.

01:56:57.720 --> 01:57:04.720
What do you get with the PSP Go that you don't get on the PSP 3000 that justifies the increased price?

01:57:04.720 --> 01:57:14.720
At least in the DS world, you can say a camera, the downloadable game service, and the SD card support.

01:57:14.720 --> 01:57:16.720
Okay, fair enough. So you've named a couple things that you would with a DS.

01:57:16.720 --> 01:57:18.720
And I even knocked on that.

01:57:18.720 --> 01:57:20.720
It's not enough for me.

01:57:20.720 --> 01:57:21.720
For me.

01:57:21.720 --> 01:57:25.720
But for a new player, okay, now you have to weigh the pros and the cons.

01:57:25.720 --> 01:57:27.720
I don't get to play Game Boy Advance games anymore.

01:57:27.720 --> 01:57:30.720
Pros. I get a camera, SD card slot, and downloadable games.

01:57:30.720 --> 01:57:31.720
What do I want to do?

01:57:31.720 --> 01:57:35.720
But with the PSP 3000 and the PSP Go, you have to weigh.

01:57:35.720 --> 01:57:39.720
Con. It's more expensive and I lose the UMD.

01:57:39.720 --> 01:57:41.720
Pro.

01:57:41.720 --> 01:57:42.720
Chirp chirp.

01:57:42.720 --> 01:57:43.720
It's cuter.

01:57:43.720 --> 01:57:47.720
It's sleeker looking and it's got Bluetooth support.

01:57:47.720 --> 01:57:48.720
So?

01:57:48.720 --> 01:57:49.720
That's it.

01:57:49.720 --> 01:57:59.720
And with the DSi even, if you are purchasing a new system, you're probably not going to be able to buy any Game Boy Advance games anyways out there because they're not selling them anymore.

01:57:59.720 --> 01:58:01.720
They haven't been selling them for a few years now.

01:58:01.720 --> 01:58:10.720
So it's not going to be that big a deal if you can't have a Game Boy Advance slot on there to people that are just getting into the DS or whatever.

01:58:10.720 --> 01:58:12.720
And the DSi would be a good purchase for them.

01:58:12.720 --> 01:58:20.720
But if you have Game Boy Advance games and you have a DS, why would you go and buy another game system?

01:58:20.720 --> 01:58:27.720
I'm glad to know it's not just us tonight because there's a little bit of DSi rabble rabble going on in chat as well, but there is some comments.

01:58:27.720 --> 01:58:33.720
SSJ100Matt says, aside from them putting President Cat on DSi, I never see myself getting a DSi.

01:58:33.720 --> 01:58:37.720
And ActDef says, Matt indeed, President Cat on the DSi and I'll buy it instantly.

01:58:37.720 --> 01:58:40.720
Which, by the way, I want to say, how fucking adorable is this?

01:58:40.720 --> 01:58:47.720
ActDef tweeted the Reno-y people to say, hey, I'm in Mexico. It's not just USA people. I'm in Mexico and I think you're great.

01:58:47.720 --> 01:58:54.720
And they responded, gracias. How adorable. I want to hug them all. I do.

01:58:54.720 --> 01:58:56.720
I want President Cat.

01:58:56.720 --> 01:58:58.720
Aren't you going to be traveling to Japan?

01:58:58.720 --> 01:59:03.720
I'm supposed to travel to Japan in June, yes. In fact, I will be gone from the show for two or three weeks.

01:59:03.720 --> 01:59:05.720
Take me with you.

01:59:05.720 --> 01:59:08.720
You got money? I'm going on a tour type thing, so we'll see.

01:59:08.720 --> 01:59:09.720
Okay.

01:59:09.720 --> 01:59:15.720
But, yeah, I'm excited about that. More details on that next year.

01:59:15.720 --> 01:59:17.720
I may have to miss E3 because of it. We'll see.

01:59:17.720 --> 01:59:20.720
Rob, I have to teach you how to shop.

01:59:20.720 --> 01:59:25.720
I know. I'm not going to know anything. That's why I won't go to a foreign country if it's not in a tour.

01:59:25.720 --> 01:59:27.720
I'm going to teach you how to shop.

01:59:27.720 --> 01:59:28.720
All right.

01:59:28.720 --> 01:59:30.720
And ask for directions.

01:59:30.720 --> 01:59:31.720
Teach me five-year-old Japanese.

01:59:31.720 --> 01:59:33.720
I will teach you five-year-old Japanese.

01:59:33.720 --> 01:59:35.720
Hey, I know five-year-old Japanese.

01:59:35.720 --> 01:59:40.720
All right. So, anyway, if you want more e-mails, mailbag at orangelaungeradio.com.

01:59:40.720 --> 01:59:45.720
Loki, we... Oh, I'm sorry. Before we get into that, I'm just all off tonight.

01:59:45.720 --> 01:59:47.720
It's all right. It's President Cat.

01:59:47.720 --> 01:59:51.720
It's not even just President Cat. You know what started it all?

01:59:51.720 --> 01:59:54.720
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do.

01:59:54.720 --> 01:59:56.720
Oh, yeah.

01:59:56.720 --> 02:00:05.720
You thought I forgot about that, didn't you?

02:00:05.720 --> 02:00:09.720
It's official. Dark Sakura is in the corner crying.

02:00:09.720 --> 02:00:16.720
I was not. I got you. And I flipped Rob off a lot.

02:00:16.720 --> 02:00:19.720
This is just one of those shows. You know, I was driving here tonight thinking,

02:00:19.720 --> 02:00:21.720
God, I'm tired. This is just going to be a crappy show tonight.

02:00:21.720 --> 02:00:22.720
My headache spun away.

02:00:22.720 --> 02:00:23.720
Yeah, no, this is great.

02:00:23.720 --> 02:00:24.720
Seriously.

02:00:24.720 --> 02:00:29.720
But I swear to God, if you make me sick, not even President Cat can help you where you're going to go.

02:00:29.720 --> 02:00:31.720
President Cat.

02:00:33.720 --> 02:00:34.720
Anyhow.

02:00:34.720 --> 02:00:37.720
Rob, you know what I have? I have a case of meh.

02:00:37.720 --> 02:00:42.720
Leo Shannon Chat says, Rob, I made that my new iPhone ringtone. Awesome.

02:00:42.720 --> 02:00:45.720
DJ Dark Knight says, Flying shoe coming up, lol.

02:00:45.720 --> 02:00:48.720
And X-Link says, I was also in the corner crying.

02:00:48.720 --> 02:00:52.720
Those comments from our lovely chat room, chat.orangelaungeradio.com.

02:00:52.720 --> 02:00:56.720
All right, well, maybe for those of you that are sick and tired of Daytona, this segment is just for you.

02:00:56.720 --> 02:00:58.720
It's the FUs of the Week.

02:01:13.720 --> 02:01:19.720
All right, so starting off tonight, the story that inspired our FUs of the Week.

02:01:19.720 --> 02:01:23.720
Apparently, a 15-year-old was set on fire this week.

02:01:23.720 --> 02:01:24.720
And that's not cool.

02:01:24.720 --> 02:01:31.720
You know, as much as we joke about fire, fire is to look at on the Indiana Jones ride and yell cool at or fuego.

02:01:31.720 --> 02:01:33.720
You don't actually set people on fire.

02:01:33.720 --> 02:01:35.720
That is not cool.

02:01:35.720 --> 02:01:39.720
And unfortunately, this poor kid, Michael Brewer, was set on fire.

02:01:39.720 --> 02:01:48.720
And the reason why, because Brewer owed one of the suspects who's been arrested US $40 for a video game.

02:01:48.720 --> 02:01:53.720
This video game debt apparently made the suspect steal the father's bicycle.

02:01:53.720 --> 02:01:55.720
Brewer reported the bicycle was stolen.

02:01:55.720 --> 02:02:00.720
The suspect got arrested, but the suspect was released from a detention center on Monday morning.

02:02:00.720 --> 02:02:03.720
And then Brewer was waiting for friends in an apartment complex.

02:02:03.720 --> 02:02:08.720
The suspect, I guess, came up saying he's a snitch, a snitch, and poured on him.

02:02:08.720 --> 02:02:11.720
And they poured alcohol and lighter and, yeah, gross.

02:02:11.720 --> 02:02:14.720
So, I mean, just, what a monster.

02:02:14.720 --> 02:02:15.720
What an ass.

02:02:15.720 --> 02:02:17.720
And over a video game debt.

02:02:17.720 --> 02:02:23.720
And it commented, prompted one sheriff to say in 31 years it's the most heinous crime I've ever seen.

02:02:23.720 --> 02:02:26.720
All over $40 over a video game.

02:02:26.720 --> 02:02:30.720
FU suspect whose name they clearly haven't released because he's a minor.

02:02:30.720 --> 02:02:33.720
But they should so we can dedicate this segment to him.

02:02:33.720 --> 02:02:35.720
Dark Soccer, do you have any FUs of the week?

02:02:35.720 --> 02:02:41.720
I'm actually just trying to verify that I was reading this properly because they asked us what President Katz is.

02:02:41.720 --> 02:02:43.720
So I was going to say doesn't that mean president?

02:02:43.720 --> 02:02:45.720
Anyway, I'm about to say.

02:02:45.720 --> 02:02:52.720
But, yeah, FU to my coworker who I refer to all the time as Mr. Annoying.

02:02:52.720 --> 02:02:57.720
For, I took a five year old baby in tattletaling on something that didn't involve him.

02:02:57.720 --> 02:03:00.720
Logie, do you have any FUs of the week?

02:03:00.720 --> 02:03:03.720
My FU of the week goes to pushy salesmen.

02:03:03.720 --> 02:03:06.720
Especially people that come door to door selling stuff.

02:03:06.720 --> 02:03:10.720
Because I'm always a sucker at opening the door and I really shouldn't.

02:03:10.720 --> 02:03:15.720
So we had a guy that we were looking for roof quotes because we need a new roof on our house.

02:03:15.720 --> 02:03:21.720
And this guy came and gave us this sales pitch that took two hours.

02:03:21.720 --> 02:03:28.720
And, well, he was really pushy and annoying so it sucked.

02:03:28.720 --> 02:03:32.720
And if I hadn't answered the door I wouldn't have to deal with it.

02:03:32.720 --> 02:03:37.720
So FU that because I hate these people.

02:03:37.720 --> 02:03:45.720
My FU of the week just goes to, gosh, tonight I've laughed so hard I'm actually not that angsty.

02:03:45.720 --> 02:03:49.720
I guess my FU goes to drama.

02:03:49.720 --> 02:03:50.720
Drama.

02:03:50.720 --> 02:03:51.720
In general.

02:03:51.720 --> 02:03:56.720
Although, honestly, you know, things are okay. I can't complain too much.

02:03:56.720 --> 02:03:58.720
Everything's better with President Cat.

02:03:58.720 --> 02:04:02.720
It really is. Although now we're finding out when the official people are saying what's President Cat.

02:04:02.720 --> 02:04:04.720
Clearly that is not the name of the game.

02:04:04.720 --> 02:04:07.720
So I just tweeted him, do you have a better translation?

02:04:07.720 --> 02:04:14.720
I see that. Well, that's what I copied the actual kanji over because, was it sensual?

02:04:14.720 --> 02:04:22.720
It's like, for example, there's a different word that's similar that means like class president when you're in school.

02:04:22.720 --> 02:04:26.720
And so and so president. It's a different type of position.

02:04:26.720 --> 02:04:30.720
And president would be the closest equivalent.

02:04:30.720 --> 02:04:32.720
I still think that's a cool name for a game, President Cat.

02:04:32.720 --> 02:04:37.720
I mean, even if that's not the translation, wouldn't that be awesome if we just named the game?

02:04:37.720 --> 02:04:39.720
I think it would be like company president.

02:04:39.720 --> 02:04:41.720
And you could do it. Okay. Get this. Follow me with this.

02:04:41.720 --> 02:04:47.720
You could do it in the style, have the cat like kind of looking up in the sky, doing the style of Obama.

02:04:47.720 --> 02:04:52.720
And that would be so the Obama poster. That would be awesome.

02:04:52.720 --> 02:04:54.720
That could be the cover of the game.

02:04:54.720 --> 02:04:57.720
We're going to make that the website. I'm telling you.

02:04:57.720 --> 02:05:03.720
We're going to do it. I can't stress this enough. Please upload your your President Cat or whatever the hell this game is called.

02:05:03.720 --> 02:05:06.720
Your fan art, your whatever.

02:05:06.720 --> 02:05:12.720
Put it on the OLR picks thing and then tweet it to this poor girl who doesn't know what the hell she just woke up to today.

02:05:12.720 --> 02:05:14.720
Here. And show them the love.

02:05:14.720 --> 02:05:16.720
The cat, Renna is the cat's name.

02:05:16.720 --> 02:05:19.720
Okay. Okay. I got the Renna part. Okay.

02:05:19.720 --> 02:05:25.720
And Sancho, Shacho would be, I guess, like company president.

02:05:25.720 --> 02:05:27.720
Just call it Obama cat and be done with it.

02:05:27.720 --> 02:05:29.720
The game will sell millions of copies.

02:05:29.720 --> 02:05:34.720
Now, it'll be on Fox News about how it brainwashes kids and will laugh.

02:05:34.720 --> 02:05:39.720
The one Sukeban I think has to do with.

02:05:39.720 --> 02:05:45.720
I think it means something about female something.

02:05:45.720 --> 02:05:52.720
I don't know. I think Dark Tetsuya says top cat.

02:05:52.720 --> 02:05:55.720
Oh, God, like top chef, top cat. I'd love that.

02:05:55.720 --> 02:05:59.720
All right. Anyhow, let's move on with a couple more stories.

02:05:59.720 --> 02:06:01.720
Sukeban means delinquent girl.

02:06:01.720 --> 02:06:03.720
Interesting.

02:06:03.720 --> 02:06:04.720
Or boss girl.

02:06:04.720 --> 02:06:07.720
So is the game like naughty cat? Oh, that would be amazing.

02:06:07.720 --> 02:06:17.720
So, well, I knew that has something to do with the girl because it's like I know characters who've been in series that have like Sukeban Dekka.

02:06:17.720 --> 02:06:26.720
It has to do with like a delinquent girl who uses a yo-yo as a weapon or like a female gang leader, you know, for a school gang, you know.

02:06:26.720 --> 02:06:35.720
So I'm guessing it's sort of like female boss cat Renna or female boss Renna.

02:06:35.720 --> 02:06:37.720
Cat's not actually in the name.

02:06:37.720 --> 02:06:38.720
Interesting.

02:06:38.720 --> 02:06:39.720
So.

02:06:39.720 --> 02:06:44.720
All right. Well, if they should download the show and listen to it, just know we've decided that that should be the name of the game.

02:06:44.720 --> 02:06:48.720
All right. Anyhow, a couple more news stories for you.

02:06:48.720 --> 02:06:52.720
And then the Skype line to say your piece on anything about tonight.

02:06:52.720 --> 02:06:57.720
What says something on Twitter said that means boss cat boss.

02:06:57.720 --> 02:07:02.720
Thank you. Akuma J.P. I'm so glad he's still listening, even though Justin TV hasn't been around for a while.

02:07:02.720 --> 02:07:05.720
He's like the ambassador we need right now.

02:07:05.720 --> 02:07:11.720
Plus, did you notice his little icon is him looking up just like Obama would.

02:07:11.720 --> 02:07:14.720
Thank you, Akuma J.P. All right.

02:07:14.720 --> 02:07:25.720
Let's get to a couple more stories and then we'll get to the Skype line at 1877 Game OLR for some stories.

02:07:25.720 --> 02:07:27.720
Let's talk something else about.

02:07:27.720 --> 02:07:28.720
Let's see.

02:07:28.720 --> 02:07:34.720
We've got the possibility of a new DS on the horizon, which is interesting.

02:07:34.720 --> 02:07:45.720
There's a rumor that the new Nvidia Tegra chip is going into the next generation DS system, seeing as it just did the DSi.

02:07:45.720 --> 02:07:46.720
Whatever.

02:07:46.720 --> 02:07:48.720
Guess you get to buy DS again.

02:07:48.720 --> 02:07:56.720
And it's interesting because apparently it's going to be similar to the one that's like in the Zune HD.

02:07:56.720 --> 02:08:04.720
And what's interesting though is it's got a really high clock speed compared to what the DSi is right now.

02:08:04.720 --> 02:08:14.720
Because the Tegra APX has a clock speed of 600 MHz, whereas the DS cores right now run at 67 and 33 MHz.

02:08:14.720 --> 02:08:21.720
And they believe that there's a potential that it could be GeForce 9-based hardware.

02:08:21.720 --> 02:08:27.720
And if it's cheap enough, Nintendo might consider it their next DS system, possibly an announcement.

02:08:27.720 --> 02:08:29.720
Maybe in another E3.

02:08:29.720 --> 02:08:32.720
Maybe not next year, but the year after.

02:08:32.720 --> 02:08:33.720
I don't know.

02:08:33.720 --> 02:08:34.720
It's interesting.

02:08:34.720 --> 02:08:40.720
It'd be interesting to see them being on the cutting edge of portable systems since their systems usually kind of...

02:08:40.720 --> 02:08:41.720
I don't know.

02:08:41.720 --> 02:08:42.720
Well, let's see.

02:08:42.720 --> 02:08:46.720
I mean, the last system was emulating like Nintendo 64 games.

02:08:46.720 --> 02:08:49.720
So this next handheld system should be like a GameCube in my pocket.

02:08:49.720 --> 02:08:50.720
Yeah.

02:08:50.720 --> 02:08:51.720
It's interesting.

02:08:51.720 --> 02:08:52.720
Oh, President Cat.

02:08:52.720 --> 02:08:53.720
Wait, would you say it?

02:08:53.720 --> 02:08:59.720
They just posted again to all of us saying, really, I can't believe it, kind people, I'm impressed.

02:08:59.720 --> 02:09:02.720
And great name, thank you.

02:09:02.720 --> 02:09:04.720
So they like President Cat.

02:09:04.720 --> 02:09:06.720
I like it too.

02:09:06.720 --> 02:09:08.720
Chat room, quick poll.

02:09:08.720 --> 02:09:09.720
Lost Cat or President Cat?

02:09:09.720 --> 02:09:12.720
Who would buy a game called President Cat?

02:09:12.720 --> 02:09:17.720
And as soon as that game comes, I'm taking a picture of my cat holding the game.

02:09:17.720 --> 02:09:21.720
I'm going to take a picture of Shermie with it too.

02:09:21.720 --> 02:09:26.720
I'm telling you, we are going to flood these people with USA love because what we're doing...

02:09:26.720 --> 02:09:34.720
This poor guy does not know what they're in for because we're going to flood them with this stuff so they can take it to their people and say,

02:09:34.720 --> 02:09:38.720
look, the US is crazy about President Cat.

02:09:38.720 --> 02:09:39.720
We need to get them.

02:09:39.720 --> 02:09:46.720
And then they'll be like, what's President Cat?

02:09:46.720 --> 02:09:49.720
This is the show is the win.

02:09:49.720 --> 02:09:52.720
Rob, when you put this show up, subtitle it President Cat.

02:09:52.720 --> 02:09:54.720
I'm not even going to put a description.

02:09:54.720 --> 02:09:58.720
I'm going to say, sorry, this show was dominated by President Cat or something.

02:09:58.720 --> 02:10:03.720
Anyhow, let's see, quick response to our poll in chat room.

02:10:03.720 --> 02:10:15.720
Do want, arrow pointing at name, I would, yo, I will, stuff on my President Cat, I would, now, ten copies, I would, my cat wants it, I will buy a hundred copies.

02:10:15.720 --> 02:10:18.720
Nove Dea is buying copies for her cats.

02:10:18.720 --> 02:10:22.720
I haven't even played my Wii in over a year, but if I can get this game, I'll break that trend.

02:10:22.720 --> 02:10:31.720
And my favorite from M.A. Satsuma, President Cat is purrfect.

02:10:31.720 --> 02:10:32.720
That's beautiful.

02:10:32.720 --> 02:10:42.720
I knew what I'm just hoping though is that I'm hoping that at least this game isn't all like written that there's like vocal track with it because then I could play it.

02:10:42.720 --> 02:10:46.720
Because I read like, seriously, I read like a five year old.

02:10:46.720 --> 02:10:48.720
I know my numbers in a few other countries.

02:10:48.720 --> 02:10:49.720
I just love the action.

02:10:49.720 --> 02:10:51.720
I'm just worried the game sucks.

02:10:51.720 --> 02:10:53.720
I don't care at this point.

02:10:53.720 --> 02:10:55.720
I don't care.

02:10:55.720 --> 02:10:57.720
It doesn't matter.

02:10:57.720 --> 02:10:59.720
How can this?

02:10:59.720 --> 02:11:01.720
Uh oh, what?

02:11:01.720 --> 02:11:13.720
Uh, pod culture, Brad just became Rina Wee's 100th follower. We doubled their followership.

02:11:13.720 --> 02:11:15.720
I love this show.

02:11:15.720 --> 02:11:17.720
Some days I hate it, today I love it.

02:11:17.720 --> 02:11:22.720
I mean seriously, okay, Wii music was put out by Nintendo.

02:11:22.720 --> 02:11:25.720
Sucked balls.

02:11:25.720 --> 02:11:26.720
Why?

02:11:26.720 --> 02:11:29.720
Because it did not have a cat playing the piano.

02:11:29.720 --> 02:11:31.720
And I'm sorry, it doesn't matter.

02:11:31.720 --> 02:11:33.720
The game is going to be awesome.

02:11:33.720 --> 02:11:42.720
And yes, I understand it's no Metroid Prime, it's no Conduit or whatever, it's not even a Super Mario Galaxy, but you know what?

02:11:42.720 --> 02:11:46.720
It's a motherfucking cat playing a motherfucking piano, what else do you need?

02:11:46.720 --> 02:11:54.720
They have games out there based on like Moomin, which is like some, I don't even know what it is, it's some character from Europe somewhere.

02:11:54.720 --> 02:11:59.720
It's just, then we need this game. I'm sorry, we need this game.

02:11:59.720 --> 02:12:02.720
I agree, we need it. We need it.

02:12:02.720 --> 02:12:09.720
Alright, anyhow, one more story for you guys, then we're going to open up the Skypline and I can't wait to get to the calls tonight.

02:12:09.720 --> 02:12:13.720
Castlevania, the Adventure Rebirth, more information has been announced.

02:12:13.720 --> 02:12:15.720
This is a game, of course, heading to WiiWare.

02:12:15.720 --> 02:12:23.720
It's been a Wii heavy show, we haven't had a lot of Nintendo news in a long time, but yes, of course, Castlevania Adventure Rebirth, this was one of the games that was spoiled from the ESRB database.

02:12:23.720 --> 02:12:30.720
It is true, Konami hasn't really announced it, but we know it's true because you know what, it showed up in a magazine this week in Japan.

02:12:30.720 --> 02:12:38.720
It's coming out October 27th for a thousand Wii points, and hopefully it's going to come here in time, maybe for Halloween, that's what they're thinking at this point is coming out in Japan.

02:12:38.720 --> 02:12:39.720
It looks sexy.

02:12:39.720 --> 02:12:40.720
It looks very sexy.

02:12:40.720 --> 02:12:44.720
It's a Game Boy game originally, but they just completely remade it, it's now in color.

02:12:44.720 --> 02:12:54.720
It looks a little more, to me, like the 16-bit era, like it looks like the Castlevania 4, Super Castlevania 4, but like, I don't know, this is going to be cool.

02:12:54.720 --> 02:13:05.720
It will have new arrangements of classic Castlevania music, yes, and like the other Rebirth games that they did, they are going for a faithful 16-bit look.

02:13:05.720 --> 02:13:08.720
What are you screaming laughing about there, over there, DarkSakura?

02:13:08.720 --> 02:13:17.720
I'm just looking at all of the last 50 followers of Reno E, and it's all of us.

02:13:17.720 --> 02:13:18.720
I love it, I love it.

02:13:18.720 --> 02:13:22.720
Anyhow, can we move on?

02:13:22.720 --> 02:13:24.720
I'm sorry, this is fantastic.

02:13:24.720 --> 02:13:26.720
No, it's funny.

02:13:26.720 --> 02:13:32.720
Tonight has just been a very special show, and it's about to get more special-er, as if there was such a thing.

02:13:32.720 --> 02:13:38.720
1877 Game OLR is the Skype line, or our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.

02:13:38.720 --> 02:13:41.720
Let's get to the calls. Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio, who's this?

02:13:41.720 --> 02:13:44.720
This is DS Master 26.

02:13:44.720 --> 02:13:49.720
DS Master, we're asking everybody tonight, President Cat, is it awesome, are we overdoing it?

02:13:49.720 --> 02:13:50.720
Yes, I would buy it.

02:13:50.720 --> 02:13:53.720
I would too. Alright, what's on your mind tonight?

02:13:53.720 --> 02:13:57.720
Oh shit, Skype crashed again.

02:13:57.720 --> 02:13:59.720
Son of a bitch.

02:13:59.720 --> 02:14:02.720
Skype did that last week too, didn't it?

02:14:02.720 --> 02:14:04.720
Bad Skype.

02:14:04.720 --> 02:14:15.720
Alright, well, this is when, this is one of those rare cases where we will actually call somebody back, because he did get through fair and square, so we're gonna call him.

02:14:15.720 --> 02:14:18.720
I don't know what the hell, Skype did this last week too, remember?

02:14:18.720 --> 02:14:20.720
It's just being retarded.

02:14:20.720 --> 02:14:26.720
Tigerclaw asked if I've updated it, you know what, I probably haven't, especially not tonight, because we ran in studio very late tonight.

02:14:26.720 --> 02:14:28.720
Hi, DS Master, are you back?

02:14:28.720 --> 02:14:32.720
Yeah, sorry, I think it's something with my PSP 2000 here.

02:14:32.720 --> 02:14:33.720
No, no, it's us.

02:14:33.720 --> 02:14:35.720
I'm gonna try to log into my 3000 call you.

02:14:35.720 --> 02:14:38.720
Hello? DS Master, it's us, Skype crashed on our end.

02:14:38.720 --> 02:14:39.720
Um, what's on your mind?

02:14:39.720 --> 02:14:40.720
Oh, it's your end?

02:14:40.720 --> 02:14:42.720
Yeah, it was our end. What's on your mind tonight?

02:14:42.720 --> 02:14:49.720
Um, not much, other than I will buy President Cat when it comes out.

02:14:49.720 --> 02:14:59.720
Other than that, um, I'm here to review, my friend got an early copy of Sixteen Empress.

02:14:59.720 --> 02:15:00.720
Please go for it.

02:15:00.720 --> 02:15:02.720
It's epic.

02:15:02.720 --> 02:15:09.720
Tell us a little bit about the game for those that don't know, because remember not everybody that listens to this show is from the Bamani days.

02:15:09.720 --> 02:15:22.720
Well, we were kind of thinking since this is going to be the last BeatMania for PS2, we might as well get it. And of course I don't have the phone of cash lying around, so uh, you know, my friend bought it.

02:15:22.720 --> 02:15:28.720
And so, you know, he showed me some videos and whatever, and I thought this was kind of cool.

02:15:28.720 --> 02:15:42.720
And now with DJ Hero coming out, the question is, is that going to, you know, is that going to be the competition in Konami to run for their money along with Scratch DJ?

02:15:42.720 --> 02:15:53.720
Do you think this is going to, you know, blow off the BeatMania fans to go get the DJ Heroes and Scratch games for the world?

02:15:53.720 --> 02:16:00.720
Well, let's not forget these games aren't here in the U.S. I mean, those that are buying this game are not supporting anything in the U.S.

02:16:00.720 --> 02:16:07.720
You're supporting Konami of Japan, but you're not really supporting anything here, and I don't believe DJ Hero is out in Japan anytime soon. Right, Loki? Do you know?

02:16:07.720 --> 02:16:08.720
I don't know.

02:16:08.720 --> 02:16:09.720
I don't think it would be anytime soon.

02:16:09.720 --> 02:16:10.720
Probably not.

02:16:10.720 --> 02:16:16.720
So the two games really aren't competing against each other. I know a lot of the Bamani community wants to think it is, but they're really not.

02:16:16.720 --> 02:16:26.720
Because we all know that DJ Hero will come out in Japan soon, because Guitar Hero is out in Japan, I mean, as far as the On Tour games, as far as I know.

02:16:26.720 --> 02:16:28.720
That would be true. I'll give you that.

02:16:28.720 --> 02:16:36.720
And some of me thinking, this is the competition for the Guitar Freaks, Drummanias, and especially with Rockman out there now, too.

02:16:36.720 --> 02:16:46.720
So, Konami tried Rock Revolution, that was a crap shame, as we all know. And this, I think, may be their final nail in the coffin.

02:16:46.720 --> 02:16:58.720
It doesn't say when it's going to be out over there, but it says October 2009 is the release date for DJ Hero over there, so it very well could be coming out around the same time, although, I don't know.

02:16:58.720 --> 02:17:03.720
Alright, well, DS Master, do you have anything else, quickly, before we let you go?

02:17:03.720 --> 02:17:15.720
Um, other than to say, I give Sixteen Empress, you know, since I'm a factor, it's probably the last beatme for the PS2, because I'm waiting for a PS3 launch before I actually buy one of those consoles.

02:17:15.720 --> 02:17:22.720
Um, I, it's, in the point of President Cat, it's purrrrfect.

02:17:22.720 --> 02:17:30.720
It is purrrfect, and Skype just crashed again, so if you can hear me, Skype crashed again.

02:17:30.720 --> 02:17:36.720
I don't know what the hell is going on tonight, but Skype crashed again, so sorry to DS Master 26, but at least he got his thoughts out.

02:17:36.720 --> 02:17:39.720
So, live radio, unfortunately, this kind of stuff is going to happen.

02:17:39.720 --> 02:17:40.720
We got another reply from Rina Wee.

02:17:40.720 --> 02:17:41.720
What happened now?

02:17:41.720 --> 02:17:43.720
It says she has a bit of the queen type.

02:17:43.720 --> 02:17:45.720
So maybe it's Queen Cat?

02:17:45.720 --> 02:17:46.720
Queen Cat.

02:17:46.720 --> 02:17:49.720
I don't know if Queen Cat, I think President Cat has a better ring to it.

02:17:49.720 --> 02:17:50.720
Boss Cat.

02:17:50.720 --> 02:17:51.720
Or Boss Cat?

02:17:51.720 --> 02:17:53.720
The boss of the cats in the house.

02:17:53.720 --> 02:18:00.720
Almost like Top Cat. But if you saw these games on the shelf, which one would jump out to you? I think President Cat would jump out to you.

02:18:00.720 --> 02:18:02.720
That shows a little bit of the US flair to it, right?

02:18:02.720 --> 02:18:03.720
Mmm.

02:18:03.720 --> 02:18:06.720
Because in Japan, they don't have a president, they have a prime minister, correct?

02:18:06.720 --> 02:18:13.720
Yeah, but I think that when it comes to representing the game, you're not actually being a president president, but, you know. Anyway.

02:18:13.720 --> 02:18:16.720
Alright, let's go to another call. Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this?

02:18:16.720 --> 02:18:19.720
Hi, this is Ray Ayanami.

02:18:19.720 --> 02:18:23.720
Hi, Ray Ayanami. Hey, quickly, we're polling all of our callers tonight.

02:18:23.720 --> 02:18:29.720
If President Cat was released in the US, would you buy it, or do we need to shut the hell up?

02:18:29.720 --> 02:18:31.720
Um, sorry, why the hell not?

02:18:31.720 --> 02:18:35.720
Have you not been listening to the show tonight?

02:18:35.720 --> 02:18:41.720
I have been, I just didn't go to a gentle party, since I was busy with homework and such.

02:18:41.720 --> 02:18:46.720
Oh, okay, well then we'll give you a buy. Well, what's on your mind tonight?

02:18:46.720 --> 02:18:52.720
So, I've been looking at the 2D shooters, like, this decade, and I've been noticing a recent trend.

02:18:52.720 --> 02:18:58.720
Like, they need to have, like, a bullet hell shooter with lots of cutesy anime characters.

02:18:58.720 --> 02:19:03.720
And it's kind of getting me worried about the 2D shooter genre.

02:19:03.720 --> 02:19:05.720
Mm-hmm.

02:19:05.720 --> 02:19:25.720
This means that, like, more traditional shooters with starships made out of characters are being phased out, and I have friends who are mostly into stuff like Toho, and Psych Witches, and Death Moth, and all the other...

02:19:25.720 --> 02:19:27.720
...Moet, Moet shooters.

02:19:27.720 --> 02:19:33.720
And I was feeling that if I were to show them something like archives or something of the force, they'd probably say no.

02:19:33.720 --> 02:19:49.720
And one offer, them playing whatever they want, it makes you realize, in the future, it's all we're ever going to see of shooters, and it'd be nothing but cutesy bullet hell shooters that are all, like, cropping topics of each other.

02:19:49.720 --> 02:19:56.720
Let's say you were a game designer. What would you do to make a 2D shooter interesting?

02:19:56.720 --> 02:20:13.720
Mm-hmm. Interesting is in, like, for people to, like, make a shooter that was more of the aforementioned traditional shooter, like, how to make it more interesting.

02:20:13.720 --> 02:20:16.720
I'm sorry, I missed that. What?

02:20:16.720 --> 02:20:23.720
Wait, what do you mean by how to make a shooter interesting is how to design a shooter?

02:20:23.720 --> 02:20:33.720
Like, because, you know, you kind of are saying that a lot of the games are kind of copies of each other, so what would you do to kind of break the mold?

02:20:33.720 --> 02:20:56.720
Well, because as I mentioned, I want to make more shooters that are, like, they don't have lots of worlds, but it's something that makes the game challenging to other than really pretty board patterns, like, kind of more of a sort of more traditional shooter, like Gradius Rebirth.

02:20:56.720 --> 02:21:05.720
Gradius Rebirth is pretty cool. I like these Rebirth series that Konami is doing recently. Did you just hear us talking about Castlevania Rebirth?

02:21:05.720 --> 02:21:07.720
Yeah, I did.

02:21:07.720 --> 02:21:12.720
What do you think of that? Is that going to be interesting? I know it's not a shooter, but I figure you're a fan of that series, too.

02:21:12.720 --> 02:21:32.720
Yeah, I'm a Castlevania fan, too. I've played most of the Metroidvania and some of the older Castlevania games, but I'm going to give it a shot. It depends on what elements it decides to borrow from past games.

02:21:32.720 --> 02:21:43.720
All right. Well, we're going to let you go, buddy, so we can get some more calls, but do yourself a favor. Listen to Part A tonight, because we're just crazy tonight, all right? Take care, buddy.

02:21:43.720 --> 02:21:52.720
1-877-GAME-OLR, username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio. We're going to take your calls right now, and of course we are polling all the callers tonight about President and Cat.

02:21:52.720 --> 02:21:55.720
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this?

02:21:55.720 --> 02:21:57.720
Hi, this is Spazinator.

02:21:57.720 --> 02:21:59.720
Hey, Spazinator. How you doing?

02:21:59.720 --> 02:22:04.720
Oh, pretty good, Huck. How's everything over in President Cantland?

02:22:04.720 --> 02:22:11.720
Yes, wonderful, and we have to ask you, are you interested in buying President and Cat, or are we making too big of a deal out of it?

02:22:11.720 --> 02:22:25.720
I might get it, assuming that I ever do get a Wii. That's the only current council I don't have yet, but I may get a Wii just for President and Cat.

02:22:25.720 --> 02:22:29.720
All right, I'm just going to put you down as a yes. All right, what's on your mind tonight?

02:22:29.720 --> 02:22:45.720
Yeah, I don't know if you saw one of my earlier tweets today before your show went live, but I have asked the three of you if you have seen Detuned on PlayStation Network Store yet.

02:22:45.720 --> 02:22:50.720
I have not seen this, but I know you were tweeting some things about it. What's this all about?

02:22:50.720 --> 02:23:05.720
It simply puts like a cross between Linger and Shadows, which has been on the store forever, and music visualizer.

02:23:05.720 --> 02:23:27.720
It's kind of both of two things together, and that's what Detuned is. It's not actually a game, it's part art and part music visualizer, and like any other game for the PS3, it also has trophies.

02:23:27.720 --> 02:23:46.720
So if you're kind of like bored of your music visualizers on the PS3, and you need something else to look at, if you're a trophy whore, then I suggest getting it to Detuned.

02:23:46.720 --> 02:23:49.720
Is there a demo that I can check out?

02:23:49.720 --> 02:24:00.720
Not yet, but I would imagine that probably they may come up with one soon. When exactly, I don't know.

02:24:00.720 --> 02:24:05.720
I'm trying to see if maybe there's like a YouTube or something I can kind of check out here.

02:24:05.720 --> 02:24:16.720
I'm looking, I actually just loaded up somebody's video that looks like they shot their TV to show this game, and I'm trying to look at a little bit of the game in action here, so I can kind of see what it looks like.

02:24:16.720 --> 02:24:28.720
But this looks like a very, oh this looks crazy. Dude, there's like elephant, maybe President Cat needs to go to PlayStation Network. Seriously, if this game's on it, I don't know.

02:24:28.720 --> 02:24:29.720
What the heck?

02:24:29.720 --> 02:24:57.720
Yeah, and also, the other thing I mentioned in the same tweet is that I know you kind of talked on it earlier on, and I know you're not exactly the type of gamer, but you know, I'm tired too with one of the more recent games I got, and I swear to God, it is pretty good.

02:24:57.720 --> 02:25:13.720
And you know, if you like, you know, the Indiana Jones type of stuff, you know, I would suggest getting it.

02:25:13.720 --> 02:25:24.720
You know, you're seeing that every major company out there that does reviews gave it basically purpose.

02:25:24.720 --> 02:25:34.720
I know, I saw. The reviews are nothing but positive. I'm sure the game's great, it's just, you know, I don't usually play those type of games, but I probably will check it out right after I get President Cat, okay?

02:25:34.720 --> 02:25:35.720
Sure.

02:25:35.720 --> 02:25:39.720
All right. Take care, buddy. We're going to let you go so we can get some more calls. Have a good one.

02:25:39.720 --> 02:25:40.720
I have to hear that.

02:25:40.720 --> 02:25:41.720
Yes, you too.

02:25:41.720 --> 02:25:46.720
Later. 1877 game, OLR. Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this?

02:25:46.720 --> 02:25:47.720
It's Legend of Zaku.

02:25:47.720 --> 02:25:51.720
Zaku, you know what I'm going to ask you first. President Cat, yay or nay?

02:25:51.720 --> 02:25:56.720
If he offers as much change as Obama, then yay.

02:25:56.720 --> 02:25:59.720
All right, I'm all for it. What's on your mind tonight?

02:25:59.720 --> 02:26:06.720
Nothing much, just trying to reflect on this weekend. Obviously, I popped my Rocky Horror Picture Show cherry last night.

02:26:06.720 --> 02:26:08.720
Did you really? What did you think?

02:26:08.720 --> 02:26:11.720
First of all, how did you get de-virginized?

02:26:11.720 --> 02:26:15.720
Let's say I had to fake an orgasm.

02:26:15.720 --> 02:26:16.720
Nice.

02:26:16.720 --> 02:26:17.720
That's pretty standard.

02:26:17.720 --> 02:26:22.720
At least you didn't have to do the Twinkie or Banana Blowjob.

02:26:22.720 --> 02:26:25.720
Did you have a good time?

02:26:25.720 --> 02:26:27.720
It was pretty good, to be honest with you.

02:26:27.720 --> 02:26:38.720
Aside from that, I'm just mulling over the bullshit decision that Infinity Ward made over the weekend regarding Modern Warfare 2 PC.

02:26:38.720 --> 02:26:40.720
And what's that?

02:26:40.720 --> 02:26:51.720
Killing off dedicated servers, basically making the whole game a living hell for clans and the ability to mob the hell out of it.

02:26:51.720 --> 02:26:55.720
This seems to be a trend this year with PC games.

02:26:55.720 --> 02:27:00.720
The only reason why I say that is because remember what a hissy fit everybody went into over Starcraft 2?

02:27:00.720 --> 02:27:02.720
You can't play on LANs right now.

02:27:02.720 --> 02:27:09.720
It seems like all these game companies want to centralize things on their own servers for various reasons.

02:27:09.720 --> 02:27:16.720
It's not even that. It's just that they're introducing matchmaking as an integral part of Modern Warfare 2.

02:27:16.720 --> 02:27:22.720
Basically bringing it down to the level of consoles.

02:27:22.720 --> 02:27:25.720
Not that it hasn't been done already.

02:27:25.720 --> 02:27:35.720
Left 4 Dead does it, but what I hear is not as severe or drastic as what Infinity Ward is trying to do.

02:27:35.720 --> 02:27:47.720
And that worries me right now because if you have no means of setting up dedicated servers and you have to rely on other people's connections, it'll just be like Xbox Live.

02:27:47.720 --> 02:27:55.720
And it basically kills off any aspect of gaming, playing against more than 16 people at the same time.

02:27:55.720 --> 02:28:08.720
The fact of the matter is that dedicated servers pretty much has always been the norm for PC games for the most part.

02:28:08.720 --> 02:28:14.720
Growing up playing on Quake 2 for example on dedicated servers.

02:28:14.720 --> 02:28:18.720
I don't know, I guess they're going ass backwards.

02:28:18.720 --> 02:28:27.720
I guess it's worse being regressive regarding this. And it's pissing off a lot of people. A lot of people canceling their pre-orders.

02:28:27.720 --> 02:28:35.720
So either that or they're being kept in the dark regarding this.

02:28:35.720 --> 02:28:39.720
My god, are you tearing your computer apart during the show?

02:28:39.720 --> 02:28:51.720
No, no, no. I was going to get Modern Warfare 2, but after reading this I'm kind of questioning that notion of actually investing in that game.

02:28:51.720 --> 02:28:56.720
It's tough for me, Zaku, because you know Modern Warfare isn't the type of game I would usually play.

02:28:56.720 --> 02:29:03.720
But obviously I know it's going to be epic, especially for fans of that genre. I'm not going to knock it because it sets trends.

02:29:03.720 --> 02:29:11.720
But I can see where people are getting a little irritated, but really you're going to go without the game completely when it's going to be this year's biggest game?

02:29:11.720 --> 02:29:19.720
I understand that it's supposed to be Halo and all the other games.

02:29:19.720 --> 02:29:31.720
But when you basically cut off the bread and butter of most clans and the fact that they won't allow me to play with the same regular people.

02:29:31.720 --> 02:29:35.720
As I normally would if I find a good decent server for that game.

02:29:35.720 --> 02:29:41.720
And I have to play with just some random Joe Shmuck, whoever the hell is at my level.

02:29:41.720 --> 02:29:48.720
It kind of turns me off. I went through the same thing when playing Call of Duty 4 on 360.

02:29:48.720 --> 02:30:00.720
It was just a lot of ass hattery and it just didn't feel right when I should be playing that game on my PC with a decent server where everyone at least knows who you are.

02:30:00.720 --> 02:30:05.720
Alright. Zaku, any quick thoughts before we move on to some more calls?

02:30:05.720 --> 02:30:14.720
Infinity Ward needs to either release more information or just really rethink about what they just said, about what they're planning to do.

02:30:14.720 --> 02:30:20.720
Because they've already lost one sale out of probably thousands if not millions.

02:30:20.720 --> 02:30:22.720
At least that's money you can invest in, President Cat.

02:30:22.720 --> 02:30:25.720
Alright, take care Zaku. Have a good night.

02:30:25.720 --> 02:30:26.720
Have a good one.

02:30:26.720 --> 02:30:32.720
Speaking of President Cat, the updates keep coming. They're trying to explain to us what it is.

02:30:32.720 --> 02:30:37.720
And basically they tweeted us to this Google image search that shows us what the Sukeban is.

02:30:37.720 --> 02:30:39.720
That was Yo-Yo Cop Girl.

02:30:39.720 --> 02:30:45.720
That's completely mistranslated. Sukeban, that's a word I knew.

02:30:45.720 --> 02:30:49.720
Because like I said, it means a boss girl. And that's the typical look.

02:30:49.720 --> 02:30:52.720
Rob, did you ever play Project Justice?

02:30:52.720 --> 02:30:53.720
No.

02:30:53.720 --> 02:31:00.720
Well there's a character in that called Zaki who wore the long skirt and everything with her uniform.

02:31:00.720 --> 02:31:03.720
And it's like a girl gang leader.

02:31:03.720 --> 02:31:09.720
So maybe they need to call the game Mistress Cat because these look like a mistress.

02:31:09.720 --> 02:31:15.720
But I just like the name President Cat and I do want to point out in all these pictures, look at the colors the Sukeban are wearing.

02:31:15.720 --> 02:31:18.720
Red, white, and blue. Am I right? Am I right?

02:31:18.720 --> 02:31:20.720
That's just typical uniform colors though.

02:31:20.720 --> 02:31:24.720
Coincidence or not, it's funny and adds to the cause. I still like the name President Cat.

02:31:24.720 --> 02:31:30.720
At any rate, I think the best way to describe the title of the game is basically we've been going and I said,

02:31:30.720 --> 02:31:34.720
oh she controls the house and they were going, no she controls the office.

02:31:34.720 --> 02:31:41.720
So I think it's like she is sort of like the real leader of the office. You know what I mean?

02:31:41.720 --> 02:31:48.720
Like Shermie is the real princess of the house. She inserts her own control over the house.

02:31:48.720 --> 02:31:51.720
More calls at 1-877-GAME-OLR.

02:31:51.720 --> 02:31:55.720
Loki, do you have any last minute stories? I see you looking at something about...

02:31:55.720 --> 02:31:58.720
Oh, I was just doing search for the cat thing and there's someone talking about it.

02:31:58.720 --> 02:32:04.720
They thought it was a Dreamcast game. It's the NTSC-UK forums.

02:32:04.720 --> 02:32:11.720
We're talking about the cat game. They call it the Dreamcast Cat game because it has a little Dreamcast swirl on it.

02:32:11.720 --> 02:32:13.720
Spirals on our cheeks for the blush.

02:32:13.720 --> 02:32:16.720
Well did you respond and say it's fucking President Cat? Now salute.

02:32:16.720 --> 02:32:22.720
No, I didn't say that. However, I did notice that there was someone that posted on the Game Facts forum,

02:32:22.720 --> 02:32:30.720
the only post, I suspect, to act deaf, that said President Cat for 2012, you know what you want or something.

02:32:30.720 --> 02:32:36.720
I love that idea. Go flood the Game Facts forums with President Cat love. Please.

02:32:36.720 --> 02:32:39.720
That is the most awesome Suki Bhandeka picture ever.

02:32:39.720 --> 02:32:44.720
And I understand that, you know, President Cat isn't necessarily what it translates into,

02:32:44.720 --> 02:32:52.720
but, you know, bossy or authoritative, you know, female cat just doesn't have the same ring as President Cat.

02:32:52.720 --> 02:32:54.720
And the president of a company, CEO Cat, I mean...

02:32:54.720 --> 02:32:58.720
Yeah, exactly. I think President Cat has the best ring to it. We'll see what happens.

02:32:58.720 --> 02:33:00.720
You could do Company President Cat.

02:33:00.720 --> 02:33:05.720
All right. I don't think we're getting any other calls. Do we have any... Oh, sorry.

02:33:05.720 --> 02:33:07.720
Grand Empress Cat.

02:33:07.720 --> 02:33:08.720
All right.

02:33:08.720 --> 02:33:10.720
Loki, do you have any last minute stories?

02:33:10.720 --> 02:33:19.720
So, just like they did with the NHL, EA is bringing Madden NFL Arcade to Xbox Live Arcade and PlayStation Network.

02:33:19.720 --> 02:33:24.720
It will be a five-on-five football game with kind of like a backyard scenario.

02:33:24.720 --> 02:33:29.720
They say the first of 30, four plays per progression, no penalties, no field goals.

02:33:29.720 --> 02:33:35.720
And that'll be coming for $15 in some time in December.

02:33:35.720 --> 02:33:41.720
Also, Nice America wants to bring A Holy Invasion of Privacy Bad Man to UMD.

02:33:41.720 --> 02:33:47.720
Ironically enough, this game was originally going to come out in UMD, but for whatever reason, it got cock-blocked into download only.

02:33:47.720 --> 02:33:54.720
But they're looking for 1,000 fans to basically promise that they're going to pre-order the game.

02:33:54.720 --> 02:34:00.720
And if you do that, by November 13th, they will bring out the game.

02:34:00.720 --> 02:34:01.720
Interesting.

02:34:01.720 --> 02:34:08.720
Yes. Apparently, third-party publishers are not required to release PSP games on the PlayStation Store.

02:34:08.720 --> 02:34:12.720
All the more reason that you have the option of buying a UMD game.

02:34:12.720 --> 02:34:17.720
And that's why you need to own a PlayStation 3, or PSP 3000 and not a Go.

02:34:17.720 --> 02:34:20.720
But, you know, hey, you're just limiting your options.

02:34:20.720 --> 02:34:27.720
Finally, Borderlands, a game that hasn't even come out yet, is already getting its first bit of download content.

02:34:27.720 --> 02:34:33.720
It's almost kind of tying in with, you know, the, I guess, Halloween season.

02:34:33.720 --> 02:34:40.720
But the Zombie Island of Dr. Ned, apparently, will be the first bit of download content for $10.

02:34:40.720 --> 02:34:46.720
And it'll be on the PlayStation 3, Windows, and Xbox Live Marketplace.

02:34:46.720 --> 02:34:50.720
And apparently, it's... I don't know what's coming out there.

02:34:50.720 --> 02:34:57.720
I don't know if that's going to be released at launch, or if it's slightly afterwards.

02:34:57.720 --> 02:35:00.720
Yeah, later this year, they say. So, interesting.

02:35:00.720 --> 02:35:03.720
Alright, I got a couple stories that I missed on the Twitter of the Tigerclaw.

02:35:03.720 --> 02:35:05.720
Really wanted me to mention for you guys, so I said sure.

02:35:05.720 --> 02:35:09.720
Because I got, obviously, I've been extremely distracted on Twitter for tonight.

02:35:09.720 --> 02:35:13.720
GameStop has mentioned what the Super Street Fighter IV price and ship date is.

02:35:13.720 --> 02:35:15.720
But remember, this is in their system.

02:35:15.720 --> 02:35:18.720
It doesn't mean it's necessarily 100% true, but it's nice to imagine.

02:35:18.720 --> 02:35:22.720
That it is really going to cost $39.99 on the Xbox 360 or PS3.

02:35:22.720 --> 02:35:27.720
And that the date it's coming, March 23rd, 2010, is the rumored date.

02:35:27.720 --> 02:35:32.720
Also, in related news, I think this was something that was briefly covered on a previous show.

02:35:32.720 --> 02:35:39.720
The Cleveland fan, John Thompson, also known as Big Dog, had recently sued EA.

02:35:39.720 --> 02:35:42.720
Because EA used his likeness in Madden NFL.

02:35:42.720 --> 02:35:45.720
He's one of the super fans that actually dresses up as a dog for the games.

02:35:45.720 --> 02:35:49.720
Yeah, I can't really explain it either, but I'm assuming if you follow football or live in Cleveland,

02:35:49.720 --> 02:35:51.720
you know what I'm talking about.

02:35:51.720 --> 02:35:54.720
He has settled the suit, apparently, $25,000.

02:35:54.720 --> 02:35:57.720
So, there you go.

02:35:57.720 --> 02:36:00.720
I'm sorry, the suit has been settled not necessarily for $25,000.

02:36:00.720 --> 02:36:05.720
That is what he was seeking originally, but we don't know exactly how much it was settled for.

02:36:05.720 --> 02:36:07.720
So, there you go.

02:36:07.720 --> 02:36:09.720
And that's going to do it for Last Minute Stories tonight.

02:36:09.720 --> 02:36:12.720
No other calls on Skypline tonight, so I guess that's it.

02:36:12.720 --> 02:36:14.720
We just have shy callers tonight.

02:36:14.720 --> 02:36:18.720
So, that's going to do it, I guess, for tonight's episode of Orange Launch Radio.

02:36:18.720 --> 02:36:20.720
Thank you guys so much for tuning in to us and supporting our show.

02:36:20.720 --> 02:36:23.720
I know it was a crazy-ass show tonight, but you know what?

02:36:23.720 --> 02:36:25.720
It was fun. It was a lot of fun.

02:36:25.720 --> 02:36:32.720
But I'm just waiting for the backlash to begin on President Cat, but you're a fool if you don't support it.

02:36:32.720 --> 02:36:35.720
Let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts.

02:36:35.720 --> 02:36:36.720
Oh, hey, hey, guess what?

02:36:36.720 --> 02:36:37.720
Oh, God, more?

02:36:37.720 --> 02:36:38.720
Yeah.

02:36:38.720 --> 02:36:46.720
Renna Wee says, yeah, I like to and I think President Cat is better.

02:36:46.720 --> 02:36:48.720
So, they like President Cat.

02:36:48.720 --> 02:36:56.720
So, now I've got a goal to make President Cat a trending topic on Twitter.

02:36:56.720 --> 02:36:57.720
Good luck with that.

02:36:57.720 --> 02:37:02.720
It takes a lot to get a trending topic, but I think the more we can show that, again,

02:37:02.720 --> 02:37:06.720
I'm totally serious about let's use our picture stream for something really useful.

02:37:06.720 --> 02:37:12.720
Send in President Cat fan art, something that we can send to them so they can show people.

02:37:12.720 --> 02:37:13.720
That's how this is going to happen.

02:37:13.720 --> 02:37:20.720
They have to be able to prove to some American publisher that America actually wants this game and that it's not a fucking joke.

02:37:20.720 --> 02:37:21.720
You know what?

02:37:21.720 --> 02:37:22.720
What?

02:37:22.720 --> 02:37:24.720
I think we need to start a Shermie blog.

02:37:24.720 --> 02:37:26.720
I'm serious.

02:37:26.720 --> 02:37:27.720
Shermie needs a Twitter?

02:37:27.720 --> 02:37:28.720
Shermie needs a Twitter.

02:37:28.720 --> 02:37:38.720
Shermie is going to be like – well, no, they have their little blog for their – for Renna, yeah, who is like the boss cat and all the other.

02:37:38.720 --> 02:37:41.720
Seriously, I was just reading this one about this other cat going, oh, you know.

02:37:41.720 --> 02:37:44.720
So, it will be Shermie's goal to get President Cat out in the U.S.?

02:37:44.720 --> 02:37:45.720
Yeah.

02:37:45.720 --> 02:37:54.720
And she can be – or Shermie can be Secretary of Fat because Shermie is a fat cat.

02:37:54.720 --> 02:37:55.720
She is.

02:37:55.720 --> 02:37:56.720
I love my big fat baby.

02:37:56.720 --> 02:37:57.720
But she's awesome.

02:37:57.720 --> 02:37:58.720
My big fat hairy stinky baby.

02:37:58.720 --> 02:38:00.720
And Rama reminds us about the OLR ferret.

02:38:00.720 --> 02:38:02.720
We don't know who started OLR ferret.

02:38:02.720 --> 02:38:04.720
I think it's Jason, but I don't know for sure.

02:38:04.720 --> 02:38:06.720
Like I don't know who OLR ferret is.

02:38:06.720 --> 02:38:07.720
So, it could be Dekeman.

02:38:07.720 --> 02:38:08.720
I don't know.

02:38:08.720 --> 02:38:11.720
It's probably one of our web geeks behind the scenes.

02:38:11.720 --> 02:38:12.720
But we don't know who started that.

02:38:12.720 --> 02:38:15.720
But hopefully, OLR ferret will get in on the cause too.

02:38:15.720 --> 02:38:18.720
Anyhow, you haven't heard the last of President Cat.

02:38:18.720 --> 02:38:23.720
We finally found a cause here on Orange Lounge Radio, one of several causes I'm sure.

02:38:23.720 --> 02:38:26.720
Oh, we got one more call coming through on the Skype line.

02:38:26.720 --> 02:38:28.720
Let's take a call.

02:38:28.720 --> 02:38:29.720
Hi.

02:38:29.720 --> 02:38:30.720
You're on Orange Lounge Radio.

02:38:30.720 --> 02:38:31.720
Who's this?

02:38:31.720 --> 02:38:44.720
Thank you so much for downloading and supporting Orange Lounge Radio.

02:38:44.720 --> 02:38:45.720
Oh, we didn't get everybody's final thought.

02:38:45.720 --> 02:38:46.720
I'm sorry.

02:38:46.720 --> 02:38:48.720
Loki, your final thought.

02:38:48.720 --> 02:38:53.720
My final thought is Daytona.

02:38:53.720 --> 02:38:57.720
DarkSakura, did you have anything else you wanted to add?

02:38:57.720 --> 02:38:58.720
Meow.

02:38:58.720 --> 02:39:01.720
My final thought is President Cat for 2012.

02:39:01.720 --> 02:39:02.720
Actually, 2010.

02:39:02.720 --> 02:39:04.720
We need President Cat a lot sooner.

02:39:04.720 --> 02:39:05.720
Governor Cat in 2010.

02:39:05.720 --> 02:39:07.720
Governor Cat.

02:39:07.720 --> 02:39:12.720
We need President Cat to take over the mafia.

02:39:12.720 --> 02:39:13.720
All right.

02:39:13.720 --> 02:39:14.720
That's going to do it.

02:39:14.720 --> 02:39:16.720
Thank you guys so much for downloading and supporting Internet Radio.

02:39:16.720 --> 02:39:17.720
President Cat.

02:39:17.720 --> 02:39:19.720
And President Cat indirectly.

02:39:19.720 --> 02:39:22.720
Look, guys, honestly, I said it before in a minute.

02:39:22.720 --> 02:39:25.720
There's millions of shows talking about Uncharted 2 this week,

02:39:25.720 --> 02:39:27.720
and we're certainly not hating on the game by any means.

02:39:27.720 --> 02:39:28.720
We're just like you.

02:39:28.720 --> 02:39:30.720
We don't get paid.

02:39:30.720 --> 02:39:31.720
Did somebody put that on our Twitter?

02:39:31.720 --> 02:39:35.720
Ikuma JP put a picture of a kitten dressed up as a Sukeban,

02:39:35.720 --> 02:39:39.720
so I'm going to post that on our Twitter.

02:39:39.720 --> 02:39:40.720
I fucking love it.

02:39:40.720 --> 02:39:41.720
Not the Twitter, but on...

02:39:41.720 --> 02:39:43.720
Place that in chat for chatters.

02:39:43.720 --> 02:39:44.720
Can C, please?

02:39:44.720 --> 02:39:45.720
Thank you.

02:39:45.720 --> 02:39:46.720
God damn, the show's amazing tonight.

02:39:46.720 --> 02:39:47.720
All right.

02:39:47.720 --> 02:39:48.720
Thank you, guys.

02:39:48.720 --> 02:39:50.720
Honestly, I meant it when I said it earlier, you know,

02:39:50.720 --> 02:39:52.720
and we're certainly not hating on Uncharted 2 by any means.

02:39:52.720 --> 02:39:53.720
We're just like you.

02:39:53.720 --> 02:39:55.720
We have to pay $60 of our own money if we want to play the game.

02:39:55.720 --> 02:39:57.720
They don't send us this stuff for free,

02:39:57.720 --> 02:39:58.720
so we'll get to those stuff eventually.

02:39:58.720 --> 02:40:00.720
But seriously, what other show are you going to hear about,

02:40:00.720 --> 02:40:02.720
President Cat, on this week?

02:40:02.720 --> 02:40:04.720
Let's make it happen, guys.

02:40:04.720 --> 02:40:06.720
It's the OL Army, and the way you can help us out,

02:40:06.720 --> 02:40:09.720
always just tell two friends about our show and help spread the word.

02:40:09.720 --> 02:40:11.720
From us to you guys, thank you so much.

02:40:11.720 --> 02:40:12.720
We'll see you next week.

02:40:12.720 --> 02:40:13.720
We'll be back to do this all again,

02:40:13.720 --> 02:40:17.720
and I'm sure plenty of updates on this whole President Cat thing

02:40:17.720 --> 02:40:22.720
and even more of gaming news because it's just a lullsy time

02:40:22.720 --> 02:40:23.720
here at Orange Lounge Radio.

02:40:23.720 --> 02:40:28.720
So on behalf of myself, DarkSakura, Loki, doo-doo-doo-doo guy,

02:40:28.720 --> 02:40:30.720
and President Cat, we'll see you next time.

02:40:30.720 --> 02:40:33.720
