31940	33101	Is that Simtoplus?
33181	34242	What is the deal over there?
34442	36104	Do you have naked Sims on your computer?
36404	37365	No, he's not naked.
37385	38886	Oh, hi, we're live.
39227	40147	Hi, we're live.
40708	41409	Actually, we're not live.
41469	42189	We're taped tonight.
42870	44591	It's a little special edition of Morison's Radio.
44611	46413	This is a voice from the past.
46453	47054	That's right.
47174	49876	Ooh, scary ghost of Christmas past.
50276	51738	No, we're pre-taping tonight.
52458	55461	Obviously, if you've been following OLR, we're out this week.
55681	55781	I'm...
57083	64138	As you guys are hearing this live on All Games Radio, I am far, far away in a strange, mystical land that they call La.
65322	68525	DarkSakura, Jamie Summers
88911	91293	Not here tonight is the one and only Techmaster Loki.
92053	98017	We're taping Not Live on a Tuesday night, and Loki just isn't here.
98518	101820	He didn't show up, and to be fair, I didn't call him.
102741	105483	I was going to say, shouldn't you have called?
106083	113829	Well, probably I should have, but here's the thing, is that then we'd have to wait 30 minutes for him to show up, and I'm just like, I want to get the hell out of here and get some dinner tonight.
114929	115810	He missed the boat.
116531	117031	I want dinner.
117071	118432	Should we call Matt and see where he's at?
119557	120878	How do you pre-tape?
136340	137781	Silly little... That's what they call it.
137801	140642	That's industry speak for... Silly little prefixes.
140802	141022	Yes.
141563	145024	Now, I think we were going to do like a best of tonight or something.
145385	159372	I think we're going to roll that over until later because one of our listeners slash staff members, in other words, he listens so long we decided to just make him a staff member, Dark Tetsuya, is like putting something together out of some really old episodes.
160512	161713	And of course this wouldn't be...
162304	166587	It just wouldn't be OLR if the music I didn't intend to play started playing.
166807	167267	There we go.
170549	172931	How does that happen even when we're not live?
174312	176193	I had two songs queued up tonight.
176553	180336	The open and the Twitter topic song which we'll get into a little later.
181197	181657	I fail.
183473	183833	Simps3 and Peggle
205540	207160	I never really got into it, you know.
230393	230613	Yeah.
231634	232074	What do you think?
232374	234014	Why do you think you never were able to get into WoW?
234034	238376	I mean, certainly there's plenty of our listeners who don't play Warcraft and there's some that do.
238816	241397	What is it that made you not really want to stick with it?
241497	245459	I'd hit around level seven and go, what the hell am I doing with my time?
247597	248818	I guess that's what I hear from a lot of people.
248998	254241	Because, you know, like when I was, I had a fun time playing with Tiara a while back.
254662	259525	But it's like, I'm not a get up and quest-o-rama type person and zip through them.
259825	263728	I like to explore a little bit and take it, you know, kind of slow.
263868	266169	And it was like, this is kind of boring.
266950	267690	This is kind of boring.
267730	269371	It almost sounds like you're talking about something dirty.
269591	270292	It's kind of boring.
270612	275155	I like to take my time and explore a little bit slow.
275595	276316	And it's kind of boring.
276336	276416	Yeah.
279324	281906	I mean, I have a good time if I'm playing with people.
284008	284789	Oh, shut up.
287070	289112	Are you talking about WoW or what?
289132	295357	In regards to World of Warcraft, I have a better time playing with a friend when I've got something to... Shut up.
302123	302423	Alright.
303544	307227	But what I was saying is it's more fun when I have other people to participate in the game with.
307768	308088	I see.
309226	309646	Fair enough.
311608	314571	Of all the things in this room, you threw a box of Kleenex at me.
314751	315011	Yep.
315492	315772	Alright.
315912	317534	You almost hit Shermie.
317674	319376	I figured if it landed on Shermie, it wouldn't hurt her.
319636	319856	Alright.
320457	322058	You notice who did not budge?
322819	323479	Shermie, yeah.
323499	328664	She just parks her fat ass there next to the very warm computer for pretty much the night.
328684	330986	That's her little fortress of solitude.
331007	331347	Mm-hmm.
332148	336489	Alright, well on tonight's show, oh, I actually did play one new game I want to talk about.
336849	337809	So we'll give them something new.
338169	340030	I played Luminous for the iPhone.
340790	341830	Did you say Bluminous?
341910	342690	No, Luminous.
342750	345391	I thought so, but... Or Lumines, as some people call it.
345591	346351	Luminous!
346571	347031	Luminous.
348252	353633	This is the puzzle game that, of course, was hugely, disgustingly popular on the PSP, and rightfully so.
354073	358894	And then had a sequel come out on the PSP that I don't think was quite as well received, even though it had Hollaback Girl.
359854	363495	and then it had versions on the PlayStation Network as well as Xbox Live.
363735	373239	The Xbox Live version, of course, was highly criticized for being kind of the first microtransaction-y game where there was just lots and lots of little things to download and add to the game.
374319	375720	Now it's out on iPhone.
377100	378340	I love Luminous.
378400	397026	Like, Luminous is one of my favorite puzzle games ever because, you know, I love music games and I love the whole infusion and all that, kind of like how the music plays a part in the puzzle game where, you know, if you've never played Luminous before, basically you're trying to make blocks of varying size out of four by four blocks of different colors.
397606	401087	But the bar that sweeps across the field moves in time to the music.
401427	405008	And as you move the blocks around, the beats that it makes kind of fit in with the music.
405489	406509	Is it worth the purchase to you?
407310	408070	Well, here's the thing.
408431	410573	On the iPhone, it sucks.
411174	411895	It sucks.
412336	412996	It sucks.
413497	414138	I hate it.
414598	415800	It is awful.
416941	424410	The version of Luminous that I played on my old Sprint cell phone that had a four directional key and stuff was more fun to play.
424710	425611	And let me tell you why.
426212	427493	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
441926	460573	and the reason why is that they made one key design flaw and that flaw is that in order to move the bricks you touch the screen and you move your finger left or you move your finger right but to drop it you move your finger down so what do you think happens when I'm playing keep dropping it exactly
461732	462753	Pebble is so beautiful on iPhones.
481032	481913	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
501474	508777	So, if you are a fan of Luminous, avoid, avoid, avoid until they get this control scheme fixed.
509117	524042	You know, I don't care if they put this shitty touch control thing in as an option, but what they need to do is have it so you can turn drops off, or that there's a specific little button in the right-hand corner or something where my thumb could rest that would drop the thing.
524342	526503	And that's the only way you would drop it.
526603	528904	That would make it so much better.
529423	536247	DarkSakura has been browsing the MMO world and has found quite a bit going on apparently in the land of MMOs.
553873	572940	Yeah, for the people looking forward to Star Trek Online, namely me, if you get the Season 3 Blu-ray that's going to be coming out, then you will be actually receiving an Admiral's outfit.
575342	579365	I really think they're trying to push the game, especially with using champions to do it and all that.
579485	579886	But yeah...
603760	609650	It looks like they're really trying to get the fans of the series into the MMO even if they're not necessarily gamers.
610552	619136	Which is smart, but the problem is, as weird as it sounds, I am kind of a bit of a Trekkie, but I don't really have an interest in those Blu-rays.
620897	622218	The original series Blu-rays, right?
622238	624779	Because, like, original series season three?
625339	627320	Although, wait, no, there was no third season.
627401	628441	Was there a third season?
629141	631282	I thought there were only two, but whatever.
631302	636045	I'm sure there were, yeah, because third season is when you really started noticing the toupee.
636576	641358	I'm not really into the original series anyway, as much of a Trekkie as I am.
641758	649702	It was all about, yeah, I mean, I get that, but it was all about the, it was all about Next Generation and Voyager and Deep Space Nine.
649762	650582	It's all about DS9.
650702	651302	Yeah.
651822	654804	So I guess that's kind of cool, though.
654984	662847	I mean, a little bonus perk tie-in, but sorry, I'm not going to spend like $80 on a Blu-ray box set season just to get some one little dumb little item.
663227	664908	Hopefully it'll be unlockable some other ways.
665333	665634	Maybe.
666295	670220	I mean, then again, it's like the admirals, all they do is sit in a chair and be important.
671102	677752	The captain's seat is what everyone joins Starfleet for, you know, to sort of paraphrase a DS9 episode.
679405	681807	I'm still very, very curious about Star Trek Online.
682047	688352	I'm a little jealous of those that went to PAX and got to get a little sneak peek of it because I definitely am curious where this game is headed.
688633	690354	There's a lot of great MMOs on the horizon.
690374	692896	Final Fantasy XIV, I'm sorry.
693436	696319	Hate on XI all you want, but XIV looks amazing.
696339	698160	I'm really interested in where this game goes.
698521	702964	Granted, by the time I play it, a lot could change, but the trailer looked pretty cool.
704425	706447	Even WoW's next expansion looks really good.
707268	710974	There's also some news about Final Fantasy XI since you brought it up.
711014	712356	People are still playing Final Fantasy XI?
712456	712716	Yeah.
712877	714038	Wow.
714138	722771	In October, there's going to be a new expansion titled Shantotto Ascension that's supposed to...
726320	731922	Well, actually they say that the next free version update is going to be in November.
732202	736583	But other than that, we're looking for October for the expansion pack.
737763	755188	It will have the new Wings of the Goddess Nation quests, the Moblin Maze Monger's dungeon crawling system, and it's also the final part in a series of stories that was written by the guy who wrote the story for Chrono Trigger.
756429	757390	Masato Kato.
758711	761554	So that is going to stick out for a lot of people.
761594	764877	If it was written by the guy who did Chrono Trigger, there's going to be fanboys that are like, huh?
764977	765157	What?
765998	771103	Well, the trilogy of the stories, I'm trying to pull up that information.
774607	776629	But seriously, I don't think that
779008	779909	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
794049	795390	Oh, I remember hearing about these.
795410	801295	These were the very small mini expansions they released that are like online only that you would get for the game.
801535	804417	I guess they pretty much stopped with the in-store ones, which makes sense.
804457	810282	If they have 14 on the horizon, development for 11 is probably going to slow up significantly and remain things like this.
810702	811362	Yeah, I agree.
811743	812543	Which is very interesting.
812603	816987	What happens to a game like Final Fantasy 11 when Final Fantasy 14 comes out?
817207	819309	It's probably going to go the way of PSO.
820202	825543	But you look at EverQuest and EverQuest 2, I think there's more people still playing the original EverQuest.
825563	826944	It's going to be interesting.
827004	828684	But I think that doesn't always happen, though.
829785	834226	You know, then again, there are still a bunch of people playing Diablo 2.
834566	836767	Yeah, we haven't had a lot of MMOs get sequels yet.
836907	837327	You know what I mean?
837367	837607	Yeah.
838127	839907	And Diablo 3 is still not out.
840307	846069	Well, the Ragnarok one was still going on, and a lot of people were still preferring the 2D over the 3D.
846309	846849	Oh, that's right.
846889	848290	I totally forgot about Ragnarok 2.
848930	849210	Yeah.
849370	849510	Hmm.
850711	853513	I wonder if that... So that finally came out at some point?
853873	854313	I don't know.
854393	855894	I stopped paying attention to it, honestly.
856935	857155	Nice.
858095	860617	I haven't touched Ragnarok in like a month, so... A whole month?
863498	864739	I couldn't really get back into it.
864779	869602	I sort of was going through the same thing that I went through, you know, with World... Like, what am I doing with my time?
871022	873304	Well... So you went back to Sims instead.
875865	877966	This is actually the first time I've opened Sims in two weeks.
878026	878947	I'm just giving you a hard time.
879238	881919	Except to remodel a character.
882299	884080	But there's something about a game that you like, Rob.
884400	884720	What's that?
885300	885621	Aion.
885641	887681	Aion, you know what's funny?
887721	891203	I never did end up buying the full game because I heard about all the problems they were having.
891643	894844	So, you know, I don't need to be the very first person in an MMO.
895064	898086	I want to give Aion a few months to let the dust settle.
898646	899906	Because it's been having a lot of issues.
900106	903328	Well, this is actually more news for our European listeners anyway.
904929	906770	They are opening two European servers.
906970	912693	One is a French language server called Deltris and an English server called Karun.
914654	922218	It's supposed to be available for character transfers from the different servers in a couple of months.
922258	923579	They haven't said exactly.
927201	928742	But it's on its way.
931504	933385	They say that everything should...
933956	934016	Hmm.
959147	964170	Alright, well, I've got some other news for you guys that doesn't have to do with MMOs.
964190	966552	There's actually been a few things that have happened over the past couple days.
967553	968934	The Wii got a system update.
969394	974998	It has a brand new 4.2 release software, and you might be asking, oh, what cool new feature do I get with this?
975378	976899	And the answer is nothing.
977419	980261	At least there's nothing that they're touting that is big about this release.
980621	986686	Apparently, the Wii system update 4.2 really only did some things behind the scenes, and it's also supposed to improve...
987540	988140	DarkSakura.com
1015247	1041880	also big big and confirmed this week there were some rumors about this and we talked about it on the show but Super Street Fighter 4 was confirmed earlier this week it apparently was revealed by GameSpot has released the first details on the game T-Hawk and DJ are coming back in the game and there's also going to be a brand new female character named Juri that is coming back to Street Fighter 4 Super Street Fighter 4 is it spelled J-U-R-I?
1041980	1042140	yeah
1043459	1047345	It could also be one of the alpha characters.
1048427	1050952	Remember Judy and Junie?
1051343	1053244	Super Street Fighter 4 Super Street Fighter 4
1073112	1075092	Yeah, so let's see here.
1075112	1077653	There's a little back and forth going on there.
1077713	1080634	I love the graphic style in this.
1080734	1084214	It's so gorgeous.
1084434	1087315	Nah, it doesn't look like that.
1087355	1089976	Yeah, it looks like just another Ken vs. Ryu little epic battle.
1090016	1093896	I don't know if it's really going to show any new people.
1094537	1098177	Boy, what if this is what the fighting actually looked like in the game?
1100038	1100798	That'd be awesome.
1101791	1104516	It's the same freaking font and everything.
1104756	1105337	For Super?
1105597	1105878	Yeah.
1105938	1106159	Yeah.
1106179	1107080	It's kind of cool.
1107100	1108543	Of course you know I'd notice the font.
1108803	1109084	I know.
1109425	1109825	You nerd.
1110146	1111068	So yeah, there's going to be...
1112911	1115593	8 new characters, 3 of them probably familiar.
1139116	1142617	Apparently though, Capcom will not charge full price for the title.
1142978	1143958	I'm not sure what that means.
1144138	1149260	I'm assuming that means it's probably going to be in the realm of $40 for this as opposed to a full $60 game.
1149780	1154342	Another thing to consider, did they say that it was going to be hard copy or did they say it's going to be a download?
1155320	1157561	I believe this is an all-new release that's coming out.
1157621	1159541	It's not some type of download expansion.
1159561	1161222	I think we'll get some answers to that in the next few days.
1161522	1164783	But it's certainly, I think it would be too big for a download, I think.
1165743	1168344	Eight new characters and all this character balancing, that's big.
1168364	1173386	So I'm pretty sure it's going to be... Does this mean that they're going to make Seth less of an ass?
1173906	1174346	Hopefully.
1176107	1179908	I mean, even the guys that made the game said he's way too powerful.
1180305	1182387	I remember that coming up on a previous episode of the show.
1182407	1183849	It was funny.
1184490	1184810	All right.
1185371	1187793	One other story I've got for you guys about Squeenix.
1188074	1193319	And Squeenix apparently earlier this week, of course, that's my lovely name for Square Enix, which now is Square Enix Eidos.
1194421	1195222	All that stuff in there.
1195442	1197965	So would they be Squino... Squino-dos.
1198365	1198906	Squindos.
1199912	1201893	Dragon Quest, Kingdom Hearts, Final Fantasy 8 flagship IPs
1223988	1232971	If each one of these games has a two year development cycle for a new game in the franchise, then that means every quarter they could release a two million selling game.
1233712	1237973	And you could certainly see that happening with series like Final Fantasy, Dragon Quest, Kingdom Hearts.
1238233	1240494	But the question is, where the hell are the other games going to come from?
1241514	1242115	Star Ocean?
1243135	1245356	Is that a two million selling title every time?
1245556	1248297	The Tales games?
1248942	1249883	Batman and Kingdom Hearts!
1270168	1272729	I don't know if that's possible, but that would be interesting.
1272749	1273429	Shut up, Sora.
1273509	1274149	I'm Batman.
1276050	1276430	What?
1276750	1277250	I'm Batman.
1277550	1279171	Are you one of the heartless... I'm Batman.
1281292	1281912	Batman!
1282892	1284573	You almost... You know what you remind me of there?
1284653	1287593	It's Eddie Murphy from 80s Saturday Night Live.
1288274	1288914	My name is Gumby.
1289314	1290014	I'm Gumby, damn it.
1290734	1291635	Remember that?
1291675	1292475	That's old school.
1292555	1293475	That's very old school.
1293495	1294936	That's older than most of our listeners.
1295216	1296016	That's older than most schools.
1296036	1296456	That joke right there.
1297016	1297497	That's right.
1298017	1298217	So...
1299485	1301626	Alright, well Jamie wants to tell you guys about one other thing.
1302406	1305548	This is actually in regards to Left 4 Dead.
1306168	1309870	The Crash Course is actually out on Steam and Xbox Live Marketplace.
1310891	1313532	And there's actually a price point on it.
1315753	1320435	It actually was released at a higher price point, but ended up being an error.
1321156	1325038	It is actually going to be out for, well is out I should say, for 560 Microsoft points.
1328700	1332463	Right now, but it is, like I said, an error.
1333044	1336647	So if you think it's worth the money to spend a little bit more on it, go for it.
1336727	1340010	But just keep in mind, it is going to be dropped.
1341151	1348557	And of course, if you have it on PC, then the Crash Course actually isn't really available from Steam yet.
1349939	1354763	It's supposed to bridge the gap between the Death Toll and No Mercy game.
1355131	1358033	That is very strange that it wouldn't even be on Valve's own service yet.
1359133	1359554	On Steam.
1359854	1360014	Huh.
1361094	1362055	I'm sure it's just a little holdup.
1362075	1363936	It just says that the download content is not available yet.
1365177	1365417	Soon.
1366097	1366297	Soon.
1366557	1366818	Maybe.
1367318	1372461	Alright, well, we're going to get into a little segment we do here on Orange Launch Radio called Twitter Topics because...
1373547	1385915	because we can because we can basically that's what it boils down to we're bored and don't really know what else to talk about here on the show tonight because it's only been a couple days since our last show we go to twitter and we say hey guys what do you guys want us to talk about tonight because you know it's where every gamer has a voice and
1386300	1388721	Sadly, we can't do calls tonight because we're not actually live.
1388741	1393983	There's another show going on on All Games right now, so we couldn't, you know, we don't have our own radio station anymore.
1394003	1396384	We can't just bust down the door and say, hey, guys, we're live.
1396544	1399745	We could just go, hey, chat room, someone call us.
1400545	1406847	I guess we could go bust down the door on All Games, but I don't think the VGO fans would appreciate that.
1406887	1408828	No, no, no, they can call our line.
1409969	1411091	We only have a couple people in chat right now.
1411111	1412793	Well, I've been soliciting questions from chat.
1413013	1414916	So we got plenty and plenty of questions.
1414976	1416418	By all means, Mr. Rob Kerski.
1416838	1418841	Tweets and chatters and all this stuff.
1420363	1422305	Blue Swim is our first tweeter tonight.
1422345	1424028	We got a lot of tweet questions.
1424148	1424628	We got more.
1424889	1426851	We got like twice as many as we usually do on a Sunday.
1432616	1437861	Blue Swim on the Twitter asks, What do you guys think of the natural disaster survival genre?
1438261	1442885	Twister the game with a flying cow and digital Helen Hunt tits equals epic win.
1445087	1445828	You know what though?
1447012	1451374	If Loki were here, he would diss that game that Konami was showing at E3, which was something like that.
1451394	1452575	It was like a natural disaster game.
1452855	1458638	And there was one of those on Xbox Live not that long ago, too, and neither one of those games was exactly as awesome as you would think.
1458778	1461380	And neither one had digital Helen Hunt tits, either.
1461920	1473946	The closest I've ever played that had natural disasters in it that I could stand was the tornado area in Sonic the Hedgehog on Dreamcast, because that was pretty freaking cool.
1474506	1475547	Other than that, SUCK!
1476975	1485540	BlueSwim goes on to say in a second tweet, After playing the PlayStation 2 game Raw Danger, I'm convinced that the disaster genre has huge amounts of untapped potential.
1486020	1486680	I have to be honest.
1486700	1487881	Don't leave that untapped, please.
1487901	1490002	That's not a game I've ever played.
1490062	1490903	Is that something newer?
1492043	1492824	This is PlayStation 2.
1494505	1495265	I have no idea.
1496066	1501108	GamerGirl on the Twitter asks, What was the first game anyone's ever played?
1501689	1502649	Ooh, that's tough.
1503170	1504450	I gotta go way back.
1505211	1505271	Um...
1506377	1507177	There's two.
1507618	1511560	My earliest memories, because I don't remember, unfortunately, far enough back.
1511700	1513981	It's hard, because when you're that young, you don't remember everything.
1514482	1516943	But I would say I kind of have a memory of two games.
1517964	1520525	One of them would be Spider-Man on the Atari 2600.
1520625	1523427	It was one of the first games I ever remember playing.
1524687	1526628	And at the arcade, Crystal Castles.
1527429	1530971	I remember going to my sister's wedding reception once.
1532136	1534317	I remember being four and playing Pong on an arcade machine
1559755	1561757	I grew up playing pinball, really.
1563658	1577849	As far as early memories, I remember being six and going to play the Odyssey 2 at my friend's house next door and playing Casey Munchkin and Casey Crazy Chase.
1578729	1584113	I had a ColecoVision when I was a kid.
1587276	1587417	And, uh...
1597571	1599413	Who enabled your gaming addiction?
1599453	1606358	Because it doesn't sound like your mom was really that much into video games, but yet you had all these systems that I never heard of.
1606398	1609601	My mom actually was kind of into games.
1610142	1615626	Because keep in mind, when I was four, my mom was still in her early 20s.
1616767	1618969	Most of my childhood was spent with my mom in her 20s.
1620490	1624251	And so she liked to go out and have fun and liked games and played some pinball.
1624392	1633875	And when we'd go get pizza, she'd give me a few quarters and leave me in the little game area so I could play the Mario one or play Kangaroo.
1634275	1636956	Kangaroo was... I was the shit at Kangaroo.
1638917	1642498	I mean, over at Godfather's Pizza back in the day in Mobile.
1642898	1643238	Wow.
1643999	1644099	And...
1645336	1651688	I've been a gamer practically since I knew that turn this knob, the bar moves this way.
1654156	1657159	I have very early memories of Atari 2600 in much the same way.
1657199	1662943	I don't remember who got one for the family or how we got it, but we had an Atari 2600, and my dad hooked it up.
1663884	1675734	But it was hooked up in my mom's room, which I always thought was weird, but I think that was so that if my dad wanted to watch TV or somebody wanted to watch a real show, then I wouldn't be monopolizing the big television with video games.
1675874	1680218	So I would always have to go in my mom's room to play, and then she'd get mad if I don't ask first.
1680999	1684463	I also played a lot of Apple II games.
1684643	1688027	A lot of Kix, Lode Runner.
1688367	1693553	I also grew up on the Carmen Sandiego games.
1693693	1694855	Yes, I played those too.
1694875	1696056	Oregon Trail.
1696897	1697257	Mousetrap
1726918	1738184	and, you know, her stupid ex-husband, Craphead, playing... He was really good at Carnival.
1739246	1739686	GORF GORF GORF
1760680	1761821	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1781198	1786043	I would love to hook up the old ass systems and see how long some of those games can hold our attention today.
1786384	1789567	There's the point of actually having a TV that will run some of them.
1789627	1792530	Keep in mind, my Odyssey 2, we don't have a TV it works on.
1793732	1795974	They take the old coaxial cable thing, right?
1796014	1798537	The little hooky things.
1798917	1800219	They go with the coaxial cable, right?
1801480	1802241	Like hooking up cable.
1805373	1805813	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1824164	1826265	My Nintendo had one of those.
1826365	1832150	You know, those TVs are going to actually be really easy to find now because a lot of them, because of the whole digital TV transition, they're obsolete.
1832650	1835292	So what else are they good for but playing video games?
1835492	1836193	Yeah, seriously.
1836873	1838274	Anyhow, let's move on with some other questions.
1838294	1838695	That was a lot.
1839135	1841677	Takeo Ray wanted to plug his Extra Life donation page.
1842017	1843458	The URL is very long.
1843518	1847181	I'll go ahead and read it here because obviously Extra Life was something we wanted to be involved with.
1847221	1847942	Unfortunately, we had to
1848402	1852303	Backout is shared on the last show, which sucks, but we are still supporting the cause, certainly.
1852643	1862545	TKL Ray's page is at ways2give.texaschildrens.org slash netcommunity slash allen, A-L-L-E-N, Ray, R-E-Y.
1862585	1864565	That's all one word, A-L-L-E-N, R-E-Y.
1865146	1876148	I do want to say, though, if you just want to check out what Extra Life's all about in general, I'm sure TKL Ray would not mind if you just donate to somebody that's participating, extralife.sarcastiggamer.com.
1876621	1877261	Sarkastic Gamer
1901804	1902205	No!
1905206	1907648	I don't know how to pronounce this name, but I'll try.
1907768	1908748	Sponchtwang?
1909409	1912290	S-P-O-N-C-H-T-W-A-N-G Sponchtwang?
1912370	1912871	Close enough.
1913598	1916479	What do you guys think about Konami rolling out the official DDR tourney?
1917059	1929482	You know, Konami announced they are doing an official DDR tournament that is going to be in certain cities across the US and it all kind of comes to a head at an official Vegas tournament.
1929542	1933202	But in order to go to the one in Vegas, you have to win one of the satellite competitions that's happening.
1933323	1933883	Qualifiers.
1934163	1934983	Yeah, basically.
1935343	1937423	I don't think there is one happening in NorCal.
1937543	1939224	I think the closest one is in the LA area.
1940404	1943486	That's a shame, because a bunch of the really good... I may be wrong.
1943526	1944367	Please don't quote me on that.
1944387	1946808	I don't have the slide up in front of me, but yeah.
1947248	1956014	I think a lot of the... I mean, this comes from watching a lot of videos and seeing a lot of people, but I really do think that some of the best players were in the Bay Area.
1957331	1960295	I think it's good that Konami's finally doing this.
1960695	1963318	I think they're honestly, sadly, about five years too late.
1963418	1966241	I think this is something they should have done when Extreme was out.
1966361	1967943	But fair enough.
1967963	1969785	They're trying to promote some of their new DDR games.
1969905	1974390	I think the one mistake they're making, they didn't give a lot of notice before this tournament happened.
1974790	1978855	It was literally like, hey, this is going to start in Texas next week.
1980196	1981197	It really came out of nowhere.
1981217	1983218	And I think that's probably one of the biggest mistakes they made.
1983599	1993366	Whereas if they just would have given it a little time, like maybe a month, and maybe they did have it out and I just didn't hear about it until a week before, but I don't think there was a lot of notice.
1993647	1997730	Because I want to say the first thing I read on DDR Freak said it was like this weekend.
1998651	1998851	But
1999429	2000030	Super Mario 3 It's so bad.
2027153	2030957	Von Johnson on Twitter wants to know, what do you guys think about Borderlands?
2031277	2035301	You know, I don't know much about this game, but I did a little bit of research, just because of your Twitter question.
2035801	2039685	Apparently this is a first-person shooter, but it also has RPG elements mixed in.
2040186	2044350	It's being made by Gearbox, and 2K is publishing it, and it's coming out on PC, of course.
2044710	2045691	PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.
2045971	2047332	It's coming out in October.
2048213	2049514	They want to make a franchise out of it.
2049694	2056659	Honestly, when I'm first looking at this, just the box art and even some of the screenshots, I'm kind of like, they're kind of going for the Fallout audience.
2057040	2059281	This looks a lot like kind of what Fallout is all about.
2059301	2061163	If I want a Fallout game, I'll play Fallout.
2061960	2064821	But, you know, it's certainly... And then I'll throw up because I get motion sick.
2065001	2066521	Well, here's the other thing you should know.
2067081	2069482	It does do random level generation.
2069542	2071163	It's kind of got something like Diablo.
2071243	2072503	They're kind of saying it was like that.
2072883	2075444	So, you know, certainly this has its own merits.
2075764	2076464	So things like that.
2076924	2082846	A content creation system, which will influence some of the weapons that you see in-game in the game world and the map.
2083246	2087747	So it sounds like this is something that's going to kind of develop uniquely for each person.
2087767	2088647	That sounds kind of cool.
2088947	2090028	Especially for an RPG.
2090108	2090748	That's a little weird.
2090768	2090868	Well...
2092293	2095710	Weren't some of the dungeons in Phantasy Star, the earlier Phantasy Star games?
2096343	2097064	Fight to the Death
2122745	2128727	So this certainly sounds like kind of an original game, you know, even though we're making jokes that it sounds a lot like Fallout.
2128767	2132048	It definitely sounds like it has some unique features that try to make it set it apart.
2132128	2134508	So hopefully they release a demo.
2135449	2137029	That would be my biggest thing.
2137389	2138730	I probably still wouldn't try it out.
2139510	2140970	Well, you have the whole motion sick thing going on.
2141110	2142651	You just don't play first person shooters in general.
2143071	2146812	I don't play a lot, but there are a few that I got really into.
2147052	2147672	But most of them are old.
2147692	2150013	And then they're going to be anytime soon as long as Dan's got ODST.
2150865	2179257	Quake, Duke Nukem, 3D those are the games I'm talking about that I got into I haven't gotten into a shooter I played a little bit of Halo the last one I played any severe amount of was Hexen now that is an old school shooting I wish there would be a game like that again like the whole magical mystical first person shooter type of thing that was a rad game Hexen was great just the whole problem being that was still sprite based and you know I think wasn't Heretic 2 the one that they did
2185556	2194505	DoctorOfWarC or DoctorOfWork on Twitter who has a cute little chibi squirtle icon wants to know the last CD or song you bought.
2194605	2195606	I said anything goes.
2196226	2197628	Last CD or song you bought.
2201031	2201771	Physical CD?
2202611	2204933	Oh god, I can't even remember the last physical CD I bought.
2204953	2206994	That was too long ago.
2207094	2209436	The World's Greatest Mashups Part 2.
2210216	2210536	Really?
2210776	2210997	Yes.
2211257	2211497	Nice.
2212598	2218682	As far as an actual song, I bought actually what my cage match pick was.
2219963	2221264	Which didn't win, I'm sorry to tell you.
2221484	2224486	Loki picked some song out of thin air and we both lost by one vote.
2224526	2225427	He pulled it out of his ass.
2225467	2225747	He did.
2225887	2226327	He always does.
2226707	2228008	But it was all the Kylie stuff.
2228268	2229229	Yeah.
2229369	2233452	I would say the last song I bought, funny enough, there's a story behind this.
2233492	2236193	The last song I bought was Limbo Rock by Chubby Checker.
2237314	2238195	Yes, that's right.
2239255	2246562	No joke, go back, it's in my iTunes receipt.
2246622	2248343	I wish I had it on this computer, I'd play it.
2248904	2250565	But it was actually, it was for Rocky.
2251066	2257271	I bought it because there was a new little pre-showed game we did that was the limbo, so I had to get the song for that, but that's the last song I bought.
2257372	2258453	What was your last physical CD?
2259335	2259695	Regina Spector
2272904	2295321	I actually think the last physical CD I bought was Flavors of Entanglement by Alanis Morissette and that came out like a year ago I just don't really buy physical CDs I'm pretty sure that it wasn't the mashups disc was the last one that I bought but I'll be damned if I can remember what it is I know what it was, Video Games Live I bought it at the concert
2297619	2298059	There you go.
2299160	2304343	And that's a great place to get physical CDs, is at concerts, because sometimes you need to sign them there.
2305623	2309585	Simslova wants to know, what games are you excited about for next month?
2310706	2311947	I'm still catching up on last month.
2312767	2314228	I haven't been able to play crap.
2314788	2315809	You were out because of your hand.
2316269	2318770	Yep, I am still kind of out on my hand.
2318890	2320631	You never even played Marvel Ultimate Alliance, did you?
2321032	2322792	No, in fact, look, right here.
2323293	2323753	Look at this.
2324153	2324834	Oh my god, a sealed copy.
2327219	2329744	and I really freaking want to play it so I can get my Deadpool on.
2329985	2330466	Poor thing.
2330806	2336678	I think my team is going to be Deadpool and uh uh Ms.
2336719	2338081	Marvel and uh
2339204	2340866	Phoenix, and Captain America.
2359137	2362900	Really, in looking at the releases, DJ Hero clearly is a game I want to get.
2363680	2370064	Also, kind of slipping under the radar, I mean, there's a lot of big releases between Gran Turismo, PSP, Uncharted 2 certainly is going to be worth a look.
2370364	2372906	But I do want to point out Demon's Souls is coming out on the PlayStation 3.
2373366	2374707	That was a game I checked out at E3.
2374787	2377649	I think it's been out in Japan for a little while, but they're adapting it over here.
2378069	2380270	It's like an RPG, but it's supposed to be super hard.
2380650	2385113	And especially with White Knight Chronicles getting pushed back to next year, I think I do want to pick up Demon's Souls and check it out.
2385393	2387935	That's actually a PlayStation 3 exclusive, if I remember correctly.
2388917	2393522	Um... Nutman wants to know in chat... Yes, that's the name.
2393542	2394203	I'm sorry, not chat.
2394243	2395244	That's Twitter again.
2395725	2398047	For Rob, a question just for me.
2399368	2401431	Would you go straight for Alicia Keys?
2401771	2402332	Be honest.
2403773	2403853	Um...
2405046	2406947	No, I have to say no.
2408167	2409168	Not for Alicia Keys.
2409688	2417471	And I could get into this whole tirade about I don't really believe there is going straight in quotes or going gay.
2417912	2421593	There is just liking who you want to like, as I call it.
2422594	2431998	I go ahead and classify myself gay because I like guys mostly, but I'm not going to say I would never, ever, ever, ever, ever want to kiss a girl.
2433118	2433518	DarkSakura.com
2461809	2462829	Like my soul!
2464910	2466050	Dark Forest Green.
2466550	2468310	I'm actually really fond of dark, dark red.
2468750	2473771	There's actually an in-joke amongst a lot of my friends that I always wear earth colors.
2474411	2480473	Like, I pretty much always am wearing brown, green, black, you know, like earthy colors.
2480613	2481193	You're not today.
2481453	2482873	Funny enough, today I'm wearing all blue.
2483413	2486374	I have a little blue stripy shirt and blue jeans on today.
2486434	2487254	I'm wearing gray.
2488624	2489645	Acrylic is a bitch to wash out
2510950	2516213	I got one more question on the Twitter that just came in a little bit ago while we've been taping and I'll give this one more reload before we sign off tonight.
2516233	2516753	This is fun.
2516873	2518634	I like this for a random show when there's not a lot of news.
2519534	2520795	Okay, Soda or Pop?
2520995	2524096	Asks Spazinator PSN on Twitter.
2525257	2525557	Soda.
2525757	2525997	Easy.
2526858	2527838	I hate Pop.
2528138	2529459	I hate it when people call it Pop.
2530039	2531520	It just bugs me.
2531540	2532460	It's like nails on a chalkboard.
2532500	2533721	Pop is what you do to bubble gum.
2533961	2536422	Pop is what you do to bubbles when somebody blows them.
2536903	2539604	Technically, the name is Soda Pop.
2540166	2541608	I get that, but it just sounds weird.
2563689	2565711	I'm okay with that, even though I prefer Pepsi.
2565991	2567853	Pepsi is so much better because Coke tastes like poo.
2568554	2573959	But now, when I go into a restaurant, and it throws people off so much.
2576322	2577123	Can I get you a drink?
2577223	2578324	I'd like a Diet Cola.
2579503	2580124	Ah, cola.
2580704	2581585	That's when you don't hear a lot.
2581605	2586270	Because I don't like, I don't really care for the Sprite type drinks, you know.
2586711	2589493	But I'll say, I would like a diet cola, whichever one you have.
2590514	2592757	So that way they won't do, is Coke okay?
2593257	2594058	Is Pepsi okay?
2594238	2595680	I just said whichever one.
2597121	2598262	I don't care.
2598443	2602427	You know there's a, you know they have to do that though because plenty of people bitch about it when it's not the right one.
2602527	2602647	But,
2603962	2605603	But that's why I specify.
2605623	2606503	And you've heard me do it.
2607544	2609925	I will take a diet cola whichever one you have.
2610945	2612626	That's a blanket permission.
2613026	2618408	If you don't have Coke or Pepsi but you have RC Cola, by all means, give me the RC.
2618948	2627192	Which, by the way, I was going to say, when I hear the word cola, I think of RC Cola and I think of Shasta Cola, which I don't even think they probably sell outside of Markel.
2627212	2627872	You remember Faygo?
2627892	2629413	Yeah.
2630663	2632825	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2656161	2660644	I drink diet soda Rob, I have to give up my diet soda and my coffee and black tea I can have green tea Can you have Sprite?
2680905	2681706	What's the point?
2681787	2684110	Caffeine.
2684170	2686874	The only type of caffeinated drink I'm supposed to have is green tea.
2686914	2687915	I'm like, the hell with that.
2687955	2688676	I'm having coffee.
2689217	2691420	But I'll have my one cup of coffee in the morning.
2692342	2692442	One.
2692462	2692522	One.
2693871	2694891	We had really good Chinese food.
2716596	2717097	and Asen.
2717337	2718078	I got to see him again.
2718138	2719699	So he's a good guy.
2719719	2720841	I wish his show would come back.
2721321	2725706	That was a slick show that this day in gaming that he had.
2725726	2726186	I know it was T-Day.
2726206	2727287	I was trying to remember what it stood for.
2727968	2730410	This day in gaming that he had that he... It was a slick show.
2730451	2733634	He has a really good voice for radio and the guy that edited it did a really good job.
2734255	2734395	So...
2735441	2742144	Anyhow, Rob D asks in chat, first thing he said, what is your favorite Japanese media depiction of an American?
2742824	2743704	That's a good question.
2744185	2746586	Mine is and will forever be Terry Bogard.
2749127	2749747	I don't know.
2749787	2751428	This is one I'd really have to get some thought to.
2751468	2753329	I can't think of any big stereotypes that jump out at me.
2753789	2763833	I would have to say from Axis Powers, Hetalia, America, who is always sitting in the corner eating cheeseburgers and giving emphatic orders.
2766290	2768152	I'm going to take the question in a different direction here.
2768192	2775897	It's not my favorite Japanese media depiction of an American, but my favorite British depiction of an American was Bubbles from Absolutely Fabulous.
2777178	2781461	I'm sure none of our listeners are going to get that reference, but that was my favorite depiction of an American.
2784478	2803893	The only thing that's coming to mind, and it's not even her depicting an American, it's her depicting a Welsh... It's Dawn French doing her imitation of Catherine Zeta-Jones, but slipping into a fully California-American accent.
2803913	2805915	It's just, oh, my California's showing!
2805935	2806556	Yeah.
2807256	2807496	Nice.
2809277	2810377	I have to do it right.
2812258	2813359	Catherine Zeta Douglas.
2813379	2815400	I lost it.
2816560	2817941	Is this something people can look up on YouTube?
2817961	2819502	Catherine Zeta Douglas, Spartacus Jones.
2820082	2820962	Spartacus Jones?
2821002	2821222	Yes.
2821963	2827325	Just look up Don French or French and Saunders and Catherine Zeta Jones.
2827545	2828285	It's hilarious.
2829626	2830747	Especially the Roundabout one.
2830787	2831347	That one's funny.
2832475	2832755	I think... Hmm.
2855356	2856717	I think it's a necessary evil.
2856837	2861302	And I know that's totally like I just picked none of the above in a way, which is sad.
2861362	2865506	But the problem is that it's not just the gaming industry that I think has to deal with this.
2865846	2869129	The movie industry, to a certain extent, definitely has to deal with this big time.
2869970	2874514	Sites like ain'titcoolnews.com or everybody's got a movie blog, it seems these days.
2874894	2875135	You know,
2875715	2885526	and bitchy people like Perez Hilton in some of these gossip blogs will oftentimes ruin a movie before it comes out with spoilers and things that it stinks.
2885966	2886387	Think about it.
2887348	2892473	I know most of us, even I'm too young to remember this, but when...
2893686	2896108	The Empire Strikes Back originally came out.
2896788	2898849	No, Return of the Jedi originally came out.
2898949	2902031	And it was revealed that Darth Vader was Luke's father.
2902952	2904072	That was Empire Strikes Back.
2904092	2905153	Sorry, leading into Return of the Jedi.
2905173	2905794	I remember this.
2907074	2909436	That was such a huge fucking thing.
2910076	2912318	Oh my gosh, what a shock.
2912418	2913298	What a surprise.
2914159	2916380	That would not be possible in this day and age.
2916440	2916920	Think about it.
2917221	2920563	A huge reveal like that would have been spoiled on the internet a month before the movie was released.
2920843	2920923	Yeah.
2921343	2922324	Snape killed Dumbledore!
2943818	2946220	I did very well to hide myself.
2946940	2952684	I mean, even though I figured out that something like that was going to happen from the freaking beginning of the damn book.
2953024	2954485	Hi!
2957086	2958807	Especially when the last book came out.
2959467	2967292	I hid myself in a hole and made sure to read everything that day before I let myself read anything on the internet.
2968533	2969514	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
2998277	3015491	and, you know, live performances, television, every artistic foray, which yes, gaming is one, we can have that discussion another day if you want, is, you know, is a part of, is subject to this scrutiny that is, you know, the blogosphere that we live in now.
3015952	3017012	It's just the way it is.
3018053	3023678	Um, I think companies to overcome that kind of have to be smart in how they do things, but it's really hard to keep a secret.
3024078	3030583	Look at what happened to Sony and having everything spoiled, except Final Fantasy 14 was one of the only secrets they had.
3030963	3032825	Most of their big things were spoiled.
3033065	3037048	And now you had this whole Sega, uh, Sony thing we talked about on the show last week.
3037388	3038950	That was a huge spoiler thing too.
3039270	3044294	You know, it's very hard to keep a secret anymore, but if the product is really, really good, it's going to transcend all that.
3045135	3046396	I totally agree with that.
3046416	3051703	How many people who had their Harry Potter spoilers still went out and got the book?
3051743	3055007	Going back to the original question, because we totally digressed from the question and probably missed the point.
3055728	3058832	Has the gaming community helped or stunted the gaming industry?
3059452	3061215	In the end, it doesn't matter.
3061535	3062897	It's not a switch we can turn off.
3063885	3072729	But I would honestly say the answer is a little of column A and a little of column B. It's probably made things better as far as promoting.
3073109	3084174	I think games like Scribblenauts, Braid, some of these games, I don't think would have sold as well or been quite as talked about if it weren't for the internet.
3084520	3089124	I think the concepts of some of these games wouldn't have even existed if not for the internet.
3089144	3093748	I mean, Scribblenauts itself has so many internet jokes in it.
3094308	3094629	Hi!
3095409	3096570	But has it hurt things?
3096930	3097151	Sure.
3097851	3099112	Has it hurt sales of some games?
3099152	3099372	Sure.
3099413	3103856	But honestly, I don't even know if that's the blog so much as it is probably just piracy.
3104056	3106839	Straight up piracy is easy to do, you know?
3108058	3108979	Anyhow, that was a good question.
3109459	3110620	Want to do one more from the Rob D?
3110940	3111321	Sure.
3111621	3115404	Along the same lines, has online multiplayer helped or hurt gaming?
3115864	3119787	Before, a good game could have glitches and they would be ignored or even revered.
3120227	3124190	Now, people will complain that it needs a patch because it will be abused if there's an online component.
3127112	3128694	I think it's just a sign of the times.
3128734	3130555	I mean, I really think that it's just the evolution.
3131716	3135519	You know, you move in one direction, you're going to have problems that come because of it, you know.
3137060	3138962	I really think that you can't have one without the other.
3139642	3141664	So I don't really see it as a hurt or help.
3142785	3147789	I'm going to plant myself firmly in the column of I believe multiplayer gaming has helped gaming altogether.
3147889	3151031	I think it's created genres of gaming that really wouldn't exist otherwise.
3152172	3153433	I think it hurt arcades.
3154514	3160359	I think multiplayer gaming and the online stuff, I think it hurt arcades and I think that's what finally put the nail in the coffin of arcades.
3160379	3161740	I think it hurt people's social life.
3162279	3164460	But I think it helped gaming in general.
3164820	3165640	I mean, let's face it.
3165720	3167781	What is the Xbox 360's biggest strength?
3168341	3168701	Online.
3168961	3169841	It is online.
3170241	3183145	And what is a lot of people, you know, what made it so successful, you know, especially in the beginning over the PlayStation 3, you know, complain all you will about, you know, how Sony maybe botched the launch of the PlayStation 3 that they're trying to make, you know, amends for now.
3183605	3187046	But the online component has always been Xbox 360's greatest strength.
3187466	3190647	What is the one thing most of us are most critical about with the Wii?
3191667	3192468	The lack of online?
3192488	3198512	The lack of online and the lack of ability to patch games and the lack of, you know, we kind of see that as not catering to the hardcore audience.
3200354	3203356	They said though from the get-go that it's not for the hardcore audience.
3205018	3209861	But honestly, I've kind of made friends with online games, as strange as that sounds.
3210302	3210822	I know, I have.
3211162	3220710	Yeah, I mean, I've met people on like LiveJournal that I'll go off and, you know, join my guild in Final Fantasy XI or World of Warcraft or what have you that I've become really good friends with.
3221018	3231563	Well, just along the same token, a lot of the people that I've made friends with out here, they were my online buddies in Alabama, you know, through playing Gemstone.
3232384	3232684	Oh, wow.
3232864	3233785	How's that for old school?
3233825	3234805	That is very old school.
3234825	3239067	Or, you know, doing the silly little games on AOL.
3239147	3239888	Nice.
3241068	3245791	I met a lot of people who are now my in-person friends, but I met them online.
3246851	3247672	You know, Dan...
3249205	3263353	your husband you met online my husband I met online so I think that while this may have hurt face-to-face social interaction I think that it has opened the doors for people who otherwise would not get out of the house you know
3264662	3265362	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3282680	3289430	It's sometimes kind of hard to meet other gay people because not everybody is out with it and a lot of people have to suppress it out there in society.
3289770	3291613	I think the internet's helped a lot of people connect.
3291633	3293496	And I don't think that's necessarily limited to gay culture.
3293556	3295238	That goes for a lot of like...
3296308	3299710	fans of anything or lifestyle.
3299930	3305314	Well, a lot of fringe groups too, you know, people who may think, oh, I'm the only one.
3305414	3306195	I'm the only one.
3306635	3319503	You find out there's other people like you, you know, you may, you know, it's, I think it's fantastic for especially not just as a social tool, but as, as socially informative tool.
3319603	3320124	You know what I mean?
3320489	3321290	DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com
3339526	3366061	because I'm able to meet other gay geeks like myself which is ironic because I actually don't go there a whole lot anymore but I went to a party they had once and I had a lot of fun and it was kind of cool because sometimes in gamer culture I feel like the underdog for being gay and you sign on Xbox Live you hear all that stuff and then as the gay guy I sometimes feel like being a nerd I'm on the bottom rung because I'm not a fashionista I don't go to every Madonna concert and all this stuff
3366641	3367182	You know what I mean?
3367582	3368143	I know what you mean.
3368964	3372708	That's why I rolled my eyes, because I see way too much of it.
3372988	3374269	Don't cry for me, Argentina.
3374309	3377413	This happens in any social structure, not just the ones I've mentioned.
3377513	3381057	But I think the internet has allowed us to find people like us, and gaming is a part of that.
3382878	3383298	Think about it.
3383318	3385079	What about the community we have here at Orange Lounge Radio?
3385299	3388541	We've met a lot of awesome people just because they've listened to our show.
3389001	3390962	To use an example directly through a game.
3391542	3396444	One of my friends that I played on the IRO back in the day on the International Ragnarok server.
3397044	3400686	She lives in Canada so we haven't met face to face.
3400746	3401607	I've never been up there.
3402107	3406189	But we're still friends on DeviantArt and through LiveJournal.
3406209	3407149	We still keep in touch.
3408250	3410591	And I'm talking seven years ago.
3412507	3432024	I've made, even though these are people that I would never have come into contact with People of vast talent For example, I met Tiara online We were friends online before we had ever gotten to meet in person
3434003	3438988	and now we hang out whenever we can go to each other's towns or go to Disneyland.
3439568	3440730	But it's pretty cool.
3441110	3449398	I've made really lasting friendships through online networking and through games.
3450339	3451620	So, meh.
3453255	3454696	What more question tonight?
3454736	3455616	That was a good discussion.
3456657	3464280	This one comes from DarkTetsuya, and the question is, how likely are you guys to be checking out La Mulana when it hits WiiWare when it's available?
3464660	3467822	I did read the difficulty, at least of the controls, has been adjusted.
3468402	3471203	I really wish there were demos, but that's a whole bigger issue.
3471643	3477206	I still have some extra Wii points from a gift card someone was kind enough to give me for my birthday, so I'll probably use it to pick up this game.
3477486	3479529	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
3492014	3493435	I'm still thinking about it.
3494696	3500640	Just right now, me playing much of anything is in small doses that I have to be able to take a lot of rest with.
3501120	3503882	Why isn't there like a Nintendo magazine that comes with demos?
3504122	3506444	You know, they do this on the Xbox, they do this on the PlayStation.
3506784	3512568	I mean, granted, those discs got made a little obsolete in this era of gaming because we all download our demos online.
3512848	3515910	But remember, like on PlayStation 1, those demo discs used to be the shit.
3516010	3517531	I have a pile of them.
3517651	3518252	They're awesome.
3518832	3523115	Why doesn't Nintendo do something like that to make up for the lack of having an online thing?
3523995	3524636	I don't get that.
3525736	3529959	Wouldn't that be cool if they had a magazine that would have like five games you could play on a disc?
3530159	3532501	They're too busy kissing Miyamoto's ass.
3532701	3534502	Or kissing Soccer Mom's ass or something.
3534542	3535763	I don't know.
3536183	3539185	Let me just reload the Twitter real quick to see if we got any other last questions.
3539325	3539825	No, we didn't.
3539925	3543107	Jeremy keeps trying to get out of the room and then she's like, Ah, the door!
3543788	3544789	And then turning back around.
3545229	3545349	So.
3546118	3549181	I'll be going to wrap it up in ribbons and bows You know what this means?
3566558	3577806	to sort of tease a little bit an idea that I brought up to you on Sunday about a little one hour thing involving a room in my house that would make it entirely possible.
3577986	3578606	It would.
3578766	3581788	There could be plenty of good fun things in store for us in 2010.
3582088	3582429	We'll see.
3582849	3584530	So thanks to everybody for the questions.
3584570	3586311	If I somehow missed your questions, I'm sorry.
3586351	3587772	We'll roll it over to another show.
3588072	3590794	Don't forget, you can always send us an email, mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com.
3591334	3596377	And thank you guys so much for tuning into our show tonight, even though we weren't live or downloading it, even though it was a little different tonight.
3597337	3598338	I hope you guys have a great week.
3598418	3603300	We'll be back to do our normal show one week from Sunday, which would be October.
3603320	3606222	We need to bring back our missing house guest.
3607203	3607723	Loki.
3608243	3608783	Oh, the ferret.
3610224	3612465	To join the ranks of... Do you miss the ferret more than Loki?
3612485	3613346	Is that what you're trying to say?
3614011	3617293	No, no, no, no, yes, no.
3618414	3624437	October 11th, we'll be live again at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern on All Games Radio, www.allgames.com.
3624717	3626098	Any final thoughts tonight, DarkSakura?
3627059	3627639	I'm hungry.
3629480	3631541	I haven't talked about food all day.
3632342	3634543	That's how you know it's in a typical episode of Orange Sounds Radio.
3635464	3640426	My final thought is, by the time you're hearing this, I will be on Space Mountain Ghost Galaxy.
3641167	3641447	Heart.
3642468	3642588	So...
3643407	3643767	That's it.
3644208	3644628	We're done.
3645169	3645689	We're out of here.
3646850	3649352	Oh, let's go to San Francisco so we can wait for the tsunami.
3650193	3652615	The tsunami is not hitting the West Coast, did you hear?
3652975	3653215	All right.
3654737	3655197	We're out.
3655237	3655858	Bye, guys.
3655938	3657779	See you next week, October 11th.
3657799	3658380	We'll be back live.
3659428	3659968	See you next week!
3690411	3690714	Thank you.
