0	3000	Orange Lounge Radio
7000	13000	We the hosts, Dark Sakura, Sky and Loco.
13000	16000	Orange Lounge Radio
27000	30000	Orange Lounge Radio
31000	34000	Is that Sim Topless? What is the deal over there?
34000	36000	Do you have naked sims on your computer?
36000	38000	No, he's not naked, he's just wearing shorts.
38000	40000	Oh hi, we're live. Hi, we're live.
40000	43000	Actually, we're not live, we're taped tonight.
43000	45000	It's a little special edition of Orange Lounge Radio.
45000	47000	This is the voice from the past!
47000	50000	That's right, scary ghost of Christmas past.
50000	52000	No, we're pre-taping tonight.
52000	56000	Obviously, if you've been following OLR, we're out this week.
56000	59000	As you guys are hearing this live on All Games Radio,
59000	65000	I am far, far away in a strange, mystical land that they call LA.
65000	67000	Or LA.
67000	68000	Dork.
68000	71000	So yes, we're having a little bit of a pre-taped show tonight.
71000	74000	So let me introduce ourselves if you've never heard Orange Lounge Radio before.
74000	76000	I'm very sorry this had to be your first episode,
76000	79000	but regardless, my name is Rob Roberts,
79000	81000	and joining me is always say hello to the one and only,
81000	83000	Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.
83000	87000	Not here tonight, who plays with naked sims, just so you know.
87000	89000	I'm not playing with naked sims.
89000	92000	Not here tonight is the one and only tech master, Loki.
92000	95000	We're taping not live on a Tuesday night,
95000	98000	and Loki just isn't here.
98000	100000	He didn't show up.
100000	103000	And to be fair, I didn't call him tonight.
103000	106000	I was going to say, shouldn't you have called?
106000	108000	Well, probably I should have,
108000	111000	but here's the thing is that then we'd have to wait 30 minutes for him to show up,
111000	114000	and I'm just like, I want to get the hell out of here and get some dinner tonight.
114000	116000	He missed the boat.
116000	117000	I want dinner.
117000	119000	Should we call Matt and see where he's at?
119000	120000	Nah.
120000	122000	No? Let him have his peace?
122000	124000	He could be being intimate with the wife right now.
124000	125000	That's true. I don't know.
125000	129000	So Loki, I guess, just forgot that we were going to pre-tape a show Tuesday night.
129000	131000	Technically, we're just taping.
131000	132000	He's missed.
132000	134000	Our aim is always improving, though.
134000	136000	How do you pre-tape?
136000	137000	Silly little...
137000	139000	That's what they call it. That's industry speak for...
139000	141000	Silly little prefixes.
141000	145000	Now, I think we were going to do a best of tonight or something.
145000	147000	I think we're going to roll that over until later,
147000	151000	because one of our listeners slash staff members,
151000	154000	in other words, he listened so long we decided to just make him a staff member,
154000	160000	Dar Tetsuya, is like putting something together out of some really old episodes.
160000	162000	And, of course, this wouldn't be...
162000	166000	It just wouldn't be OLR if the music I didn't intend to play started playing.
166000	170000	There we go.
170000	174000	How does that happen, even when we're not live?
174000	176000	I had two songs queued up tonight.
176000	181000	The open and the Twitter topic song, which we'll get into a little later.
181000	183000	I fail.
183000	185000	Isn't it nice to know that even when we're not live,
185000	187000	we can still have technical difficulties?
187000	188000	Amazing.
188000	189000	It wouldn't be us if we didn't.
189000	190000	That's right.
190000	194000	Well, usually we would start off the show with a little bit of how was your gaming week,
194000	198000	although we're only about two days since we taped the last episode of Orange is on its Radio.
198000	201000	I don't know if there's a lot new going on, but I'll ask, Dark Soccer,
201000	203000	is there anything exciting going on in your gaming week?
203000	205000	Sims 3 and Peggle.
205000	207000	That's about it.
207000	209000	It's pretty much the same story with me.
209000	212000	Sims 3 and Peggle. Wow. What a coincidence.
212000	213000	No, I'm not playing Sims 3 and Peggle.
213000	215000	I'm playing WoW and Bejeweled.
215000	216000	There you go.
216000	217000	And Bejeweled in WoW, actually.
217000	219000	I'm actually gonna...
219000	221000	Hopefully if I can scrounge together the 14 bucks,
221000	225000	I'll pay for a couple months of my account.
225000	228000	You should definitely come back. It's crackalicious.
228000	230000	I never really got into it, you know.
230000	232000	Yeah?
232000	234000	Why do you think you never were able to get into WoW?
234000	237000	I mean, certainly, there's plenty of our listeners who don't play Warcraft.
237000	239000	And there's some that do.
239000	241000	What is it that made you not really want to stick with it?
241000	243000	I'd hit around level 7 and go,
243000	247000	What the hell am I doing with my time?
247000	249000	I guess that's what I hear from a lot of people.
249000	251000	Because, you know, like, when I was...
251000	254000	I had a fun time playing with Tiara a while back.
254000	258000	But it's like, I'm not a get up and Questarama type person
258000	260000	and zip through them.
260000	264000	I like to explore a little bit and take it, you know, kind of slow.
264000	267000	And it's like, this is kind of boring.
267000	268000	This is kind of boring.
268000	270000	It almost sounds like you're talking about something dirty.
270000	271000	It's kind of boring.
271000	276000	I like to take my time and explore a little bit slow.
276000	279000	Eh, it's kind of boring.
279000	284000	I mean, I have a good time if I'm playing with people.
284000	287000	Oh, shut up.
287000	289000	Are you talking about WoW or what?
289000	294000	With regards to World of Warcraft, I have a better time playing with a friend
294000	302000	when I've got something to shut up.
302000	303000	Alright.
303000	308000	But what I was saying is more fun when I have other people to participate in the game with.
308000	311000	I see. Fair enough.
311000	315000	Of all the things in this room, you threw a box of Kleenex at me.
315000	316000	Yep.
316000	318000	You almost hit Shermie.
318000	320000	But if it landed on Shermie, it wouldn't hurt her.
320000	321000	Alright.
321000	323000	You notice who did not budge?
323000	324000	Shermie, yeah.
324000	329000	She just parks her badass there next to the very warm computer for pretty much the night.
329000	332000	That's her little fortress of solitude.
332000	333000	Alright.
333000	334000	Well, on tonight's show...
334000	337000	Oh, I actually did play one new game I want to talk about.
337000	338000	So, we'll give them something new.
338000	341000	I played Luminous for the iPhone.
341000	342000	Did you say Bluminous?
342000	343000	No, Luminous.
343000	344000	I thought so, but...
344000	346000	Or Lumines, as some people call it.
346000	348000	Luminous. Luminous.
348000	354000	This is the puzzle game that, of course, was hugely, disgustingly popular on the PSP, and rightfully so.
354000	360000	And then it had a sequel come out on the PSP that I don't think was quite as well received, even though it had Hollaback Girl.
360000	364000	And then it had versions on the PlayStation Network, as well as Xbox Live.
364000	369000	The Xbox Live version, of course, was highly criticized for being kind of the first microtransaction-y game.
369000	370000	I hate that word.
370000	374000	Lots and lots of little things to download and add to the game.
374000	376000	Now it's out on iPhone.
376000	378000	And I love Luminous.
378000	380000	Like, Luminous is one of my favorite puzzle games ever.
380000	383000	Because you know I love music games, and I love the whole infusion and all that.
383000	387000	Kind of like how the music plays a part in the puzzle game.
387000	397000	Where, you know, if you've never played Luminous before, basically you're trying to make blocks of varying size out of 4x4 blocks of different colors.
397000	401000	But the bar that sweeps across the field moves in time to the music.
401000	405000	And as you move the blocks around, the beats that it makes kind of fit in with the music.
405000	407000	Is it worth the purchase to you?
407000	408000	Well, here's the thing.
408000	411000	On the iPhone, it sucks.
411000	412000	It sucks.
412000	413000	It sucks.
413000	414000	I hate it.
414000	416000	It is awful.
416000	424000	The version of Luminous that I played on my old Sprint cell phone that had a four directional key and stuff was more fun to play.
424000	426000	And let me tell you why.
426000	432000	It's all about, and the reason why I'm so harsh on this game, because honestly, it's got some new skins.
432000	434000	It is a very nice looking game.
434000	441000	But the reason why I got so frustrated with this, I wanted to throw my phone across the room, is that the controls are shit.
441000	446000	And the reason why is that they made one key design flaw.
446000	453000	And that flaw is that in order to move the bricks, you touch the screen and you move your finger left, or you move your finger right.
453000	456000	But to drop it, you move your finger down.
456000	459000	So what do you think happens when I'm playing...
459000	460000	Keep dropping it.
460000	461000	Exactly.
461000	466000	That's exactly what happens when I play Luminous on the phone, is that when I'm trying to move bricks left and right...
466000	472000	Oh, and you tap the screen to rotate your block, which sometimes results in movement that you didn't intend.
472000	478000	You need to have another control scheme in, or patch in another control scheme then, because that just sounds like it'd be...
478000	481000	And like, Peggle is so beautiful on iPhone.
481000	484000	Yeah, there's other games that work out great on iPhone, don't get me wrong.
484000	487000	But Luminous is not one of them, and it's all about a design flaw.
487000	494000	Like, it's to the point where I'm seriously looking at it going, did anyone actually play this game to see if it was any fun?
494000	501000	Or was it something that was just kind of like conceived, and hey, iPhone gaming's really big, let's just kind of put it out there and see what happens.
501000	509000	So, if you are a fan of Luminous, avoid, avoid, avoid, until they get this control scheme fixed.
509000	517000	You know, I don't care if they put this shitty touch control thing in as an option, but what they need to do is have it so you can turn drops off,
517000	524000	or that there's a specific little button in the right-hand corner or something where my thumb could rest that would drop the thing.
524000	529000	And that's the only way you would drop it. That would make it so much better.
529000	530000	I agree.
530000	531000	So...
531000	533000	From how you're describing it at any rate.
533000	534000	Yeah.
534000	542000	Alright, so we want to cover some news stories tonight for you guys, because even though it's only Tuesday, there's been a lot that's happened this week in gaming.
542000	546000	You know, with the close of the Tokyo Game Show and so forth, there's quite a bit of stuff going on.
546000	553000	Dark Soccer has been browsing the MMO world, and has found quite a bit going on apparently in the land of MMOs.
553000	567000	Yeah, for the people looking forward to Star Trek Online, namely me, if you get the Season 3 Blu-Ray that's going to be coming out,
567000	577000	then you will be actually receiving an Admiral's Outfit for Star Trek Online.
577000	583000	So, I can't think of a lot of, like, buy-the-movie-get-something-in-a-game tie-ins going on.
583000	588000	I'm sure there's been something else before that I'm just not thinking of, like, maybe with some of those Disney games they do and stuff,
588000	594000	but that's, especially with an MMO, I can't think of a time where it's been buy a Blu-Ray, get an item in an MMO.
594000	595000	Which is kind of interesting.
595000	600000	I really think that they're trying to push the game, I mean, especially with using Champions to do it and all that,
600000	610000	but yeah, it looks like they're really trying to get the fans of the series into the MMO even if they're not necessarily gamers.
610000	617000	Which is smart, but the problem is, like, as weird as it sounds, I am kind of a bit of a Trekkie,
617000	622000	but I don't really have an interest in those Blu-Rays, the original series Blu-Rays, right?
622000	627000	Because, like, original series Season 3? Although, wait, no, there was no third series.
627000	628000	Yeah, there was.
628000	629000	Was there a third season?
629000	631000	I thought there were only two, but whatever.
631000	636000	I'm sure there, yeah, because third season is when you really started noticing the toupee.
636000	642000	I'm not really into the original series anyway, as much of a Trekkie as I am, it was all about,
642000	649000	yeah, I mean, I get that, but it was all about the, it was all about Next Generation and Voyager and DSpace 9.
649000	651000	It's all about DS9.
651000	663000	Yeah, so, I guess that's kind of cool, though, I mean, a little bonus perk tie-in, but sorry, I'm not going to spend, like, $80 on a Blu-Ray box set season just to get some, one dumb little item.
663000	665000	Hopefully it'll be unlockable some other ways.
665000	671000	Maybe. I mean, then again, it's like, the admirals, all they do is sit in a chair and be important.
671000	674000	The captain's seat is what everyone joins Starfleet for.
674000	679000	You know, to sort of paraphrase a DS9 episode.
679000	682000	I'm still very, very curious about Star Trek Online.
682000	688000	I'm a little jealous of those that went to PAX and got to get a little sneak peek of it, because I definitely am curious where this game is headed.
688000	691000	There's a lot of great MMOs on the horizon.
691000	696000	You know, Final Fantasy XIV, I'm sorry, hate on XI all you want, but XIV looks amazing.
696000	698000	I'm really interested in where this game goes.
698000	704000	Granted, you know, by the time I play it, a lot could change, but the trailer looked pretty cool.
704000	707000	Even WoW's next expansion looks really good.
707000	711000	Well, there's also some news about Final Fantasy XI since you brought it up.
711000	712000	People are still playing Final Fantasy XI?
712000	713000	Yeah.
713000	714000	Wow.
714000	726000	There's, in October, there's going to be a new expansion titled a Shantotto Ascension that's supposed to...
726000	732000	Well, actually they say that the next free version update is going to be in November.
732000	737000	But other than that, we're looking for October for the expansion pack.
737000	746000	It will have the new Wings of the Goddess Nation quest, the Moblin Maze Monger's dungeon crawling system.
746000	758000	And it's also the final part in a series of stories that was written by the guy who wrote the story for Chrono Trigger, Masato Kato.
758000	765000	So, that is going to stick out for a lot of people. If it was written by the guy who did Chrono Trigger, there's going to be fanboys that are like, huh? What?
765000	771000	Well, the trilogy of the stories, I'm trying to pull up that information.
771000	793000	But seriously, I don't think that it's really supposed to be all of that, because there was the Crystalline Prophecy was the first one, and then there was the Mughal Kupo Detat, the Evil in Small Doses.
793000	797000	Oh, I remember hearing about these. These were the very small mini expansions they released.
797000	798000	Yeah.
798000	804000	Like online only that you would get for the game. I guess they pretty much stopped with the in-store ones, which makes sense.
804000	810000	If they have 14 on the horizon, development for 11 is probably going to slow up significantly and remain things like this.
810000	811000	Yeah, I agree.
811000	816000	Which is very interesting. What happens to a game like Final Fantasy XI when Final Fantasy XIV comes out?
816000	820000	It's probably going to go the way of PSO.
820000	827000	But you look at EverQuest and EverQuest II, I think there's more people still playing the original EverQuest. It's going to be interesting.
827000	834000	But I think that doesn't always happen, though. Then again, there are still a bunch of people playing Diablo II.
834000	837000	Yeah, we haven't had a lot of MMOs get sequels yet, you know what I mean?
837000	838000	Yeah.
838000	840000	And Diablo III's still not out.
840000	846000	Well, the Ragnarok one was still going on, and a lot of people were still preferring the 2D over the 3D.
846000	848000	Oh, that's right. I totally forgot about Ragnarok II.
848000	849000	Yeah.
849000	853000	Hmm. I wonder if that... So that finally came out at some point?
853000	856000	I don't know. I stopped paying attention to it, honestly.
856000	857000	Nice.
857000	860000	I haven't touched Ragnarok in like a month, so...
860000	863000	A whole month?
863000	868000	I couldn't really get back into it. I sort of was going through the same thing that I went through with World of Warcraft.
868000	871000	What am I doing with my time?
871000	875000	So you went back to Sims instead.
875000	878000	This is actually the first time I've opened Sims in two weeks.
878000	879000	I'm just giving you a hard time.
879000	882000	Except to remodel a character.
882000	884000	But there's something about a game that you like, Rob.
884000	885000	What's that?
885000	886000	Aion.
886000	891000	Aion? You know what's funny? I never did end up buying the full game, because I heard about all the problems they were having.
891000	895000	So, you know, I don't need to be the very first person in an MMO.
895000	898000	I want to give Aion a few months to let the dust settle.
898000	900000	Because it's been having a lot of issues.
900000	904000	Well, this is actually more news for our European listeners, anyway.
904000	907000	They're opening two European servers.
907000	913000	One is a French language server called Deltres, and an English server called Carun.
913000	922000	It's supposed to be available for character transfers from the different servers in a couple of months.
922000	924000	They haven't said exactly.
924000	929000	But it's on its way.
929000	934000	They say that everything should...
934000	939000	Well, they kind of needed it, because they were having a lot of problems when it launched in Europe.
939000	941000	The servers were backing up like crazy, too.
941000	948000	That's what it was saying, is that there was way too much of a backlog on the servers and slowing everything down.
948000	953000	So that's why they've opened the other two, and they're going to have it where you can move your characters.
953000	957000	But that's... that's... something.
957000	960000	Hmm. Alright.
960000	964000	Well, I've got some other news for you guys that doesn't have to do with MMOs.
964000	967000	There's actually been a few things that have happened over the past couple days.
967000	973000	The Wii got a system update. It has a brand new 4.2 release software, and you might be asking,
973000	975000	Oh, what cool new feature do I get with this?
975000	977000	And the answer is nothing.
977000	980000	At least there's nothing that they're touting that is big about this release.
980000	985000	Apparently, the Wii system update 4.2 really only did some things behind the scenes,
985000	990000	and it's also supposed to improve performance of the system, whatever that means.
990000	995000	I don't know what exactly was broken that they needed to fix, but they're saying that's what they did in this.
995000	1000000	Also, what you probably want to know, it patches out the homebrew channel at least for, you know,
1000000	1002000	the next couple days until they figure it out.
1002000	1005000	Exactly. So it shuts out the homebrew channel once again.
1005000	1010000	So if you are a homebrew Wii person, you might want to avoid that update for a little bit.
1010000	1014000	But everybody's little blue light was a-glowing this week.
1014000	1017000	Also, big, big, and confirmed this week.
1017000	1019000	There were some rumors about this, and we talked about it on the show,
1019000	1023000	but Super Street Fighter 4 was confirmed earlier this week.
1023000	1028000	It apparently was revealed by GameSpot, has released the first details on the game.
1028000	1032000	T-Hawk and DJ are coming back in the game.
1032000	1036000	And there's also going to be a brand new female character named Juri
1036000	1039000	that is coming back to Street Fighter 4, Super Street Fighter 4.
1039000	1042000	Oh, wait, is this spelled J-U-R-I?
1042000	1043000	Yeah.
1043000	1051000	It could also be one of the alpha characters. Remember, Judy and Junie?
1051000	1056000	I'll be honest, I didn't play much of the alpha series, which is why I'm reading that like it's news to me.
1056000	1061000	Sadly, no, I don't know. There's a little trailer here that might show more information.
1061000	1063000	I'll play a little bit of the trailer here.
1063000	1069000	But I did want to say it's not just these three characters.
1069000	1072000	There's going to be five more, eight new characters in Super Street Fighter 4.
1072000	1073000	When?
1073000	1078000	Yeah, so let's see here. There's a little back and forth going on there.
1078000	1086000	I love the graphic style in this. It's so gorgeous.
1086000	1088000	Nah, it doesn't look like that.
1088000	1090000	Yeah, it looks like just another Ken versus Ryu little epic battle.
1090000	1095000	I don't know if it's really going to show any new people.
1095000	1096000	Ken looks this odd.
1096000	1100000	Boy, what if this is what the fighting actually looked like in the game?
1100000	1102000	That'd be awesome.
1102000	1105000	It's the same freaking font and everything.
1105000	1106000	For Super?
1106000	1107000	Yeah.
1107000	1108000	That's kind of cool.
1108000	1109000	Of course you know I noticed the font.
1109000	1110000	I know. You nerd.
1110000	1116000	So yeah, there's going to be eight new characters, three of them probably familiar.
1116000	1121000	Now, what's also interesting, this game is coming out in the spring in an already crowded 2010.
1121000	1124000	It's coming out on the PlayStation 3 and the Xbox 360.
1124000	1129000	You will not be able to do cross-game matches between the original Street Fighter 4 and Super
1129000	1132000	because they are also doing some character balancing.
1132000	1136000	They're going to address some of the concerns that people had about the original characters in the game.
1136000	1139000	And of course, you know, there's eight new characters.
1139000	1143000	Apparently though, Capcom will not charge full price for the title.
1143000	1144000	I'm not sure what that means.
1144000	1150000	I'm assuming that means it's probably going to be in the realm of about $40 for this as opposed to a full $60 game.
1150000	1155000	Another thing to consider, did they say that it was going to be hard copy or did they say it's going to be a download?
1155000	1158000	I believe this is an all new release that's coming out.
1158000	1160000	It's not some type of download expansion.
1160000	1162000	I think we'll get some answers to that in the next few days.
1162000	1165000	But it certainly, I think it would be too big for a download, I think.
1165000	1168000	Eight new characters and all this character balancing.
1168000	1170000	That's big.
1170000	1171000	So I'm pretty sure it's going to be.
1171000	1174000	Does this mean that they're going to make Seth less of an ass?
1174000	1176000	Hopefully.
1176000	1180000	I mean, even the guys that made the game said he's way too powerful.
1180000	1182000	I remember that coming up on a previous episode of the show.
1182000	1184000	It was fun.
1184000	1188000	Alright, one other story I've got for you guys about Squeenix.
1188000	1194000	And Squeenix, apparently earlier this week, of course that's my lovely name for Square Enix, which now is Square Enix Eidos.
1194000	1195000	All that stuff in there.
1195000	1199000	So what would they be? Squeenodos. Squeendos.
1199000	1203000	That sounds like a flu that will be going around next year. We'll see.
1203000	1208000	Anyhow, they are obviously a huge company with a lot of role playing games.
1208000	1213000	Some of their biggest franchises, of course, Dragon Quest, Kingdom Hearts, Final Fantasy.
1213000	1223000	Well, they have come out and said in a recent interview with Rooters that they want to have eight flagship IPs that will be capable of selling two million units.
1223000	1233000	If each one of these games has a two year development cycle for a new game in the franchise, then that means every quarter they could release a two million selling game.
1233000	1238000	And you could certainly see that happening with series like Final Fantasy, Dragon Quest, Kingdom Hearts.
1238000	1241000	But the question is, where the hell are the other games going to come from?
1241000	1243000	Star Ocean?
1243000	1245000	Is that a two million selling title every time?
1245000	1249000	The Tales games?
1249000	1257000	Well, one thought is that perhaps because they also just recently got Eidos as a part of this as well, Eidos made Batman Arkham Asylum, let's not forget.
1257000	1265000	So the Batman series, which as weird as it is to say that Square Enix would have Batman, that could be a possible kind of IP for them.
1265000	1267000	Batman and Kingdom Hearts!
1267000	1270000	Oh, God.
1270000	1273000	I don't know if that's possible, but that would be interesting.
1273000	1276000	Shut up, Sora. I'm Batman.
1276000	1279000	What? I'm Batman. Are you one of the heartless?
1279000	1281000	I'm Batman!
1281000	1283000	Batman!
1283000	1288000	You almost, you know what you remind me of there is Eddie Murphy from 80s Saturday Night Live.
1288000	1292000	My name is Gumby. I'm Gumby Dammit.
1292000	1293000	That's old school.
1293000	1295000	That's very old school. That's older than most of our listeners.
1295000	1296000	That's older than most schools.
1296000	1298000	That joke right there. That's right.
1298000	1302000	So, alright, well Jamie wants to tell you guys about one other thing.
1302000	1306000	This is actually in regards to Left 4 Dead.
1306000	1314000	The Crash Course is actually out on Steam in the Xbox Live Marketplace, and there's actually a price point on it.
1314000	1321000	It actually was released at a higher price point, but ended up being an error.
1321000	1333000	It is actually going to be out for, well, is out, I should say, for 560 Microsoft points right now, but it is, like I said, an error.
1333000	1341000	So if you think it's worth the money to spend a little bit more on it, go for it, but just keep in mind it is going to be dropped.
1341000	1350000	And, of course, if you have it on PC, then the Crash Course actually isn't really available from Steam yet.
1350000	1355000	It's supposed to, you know, bridge the gap between the death toll and No Mercy.
1355000	1360000	That is very strange that it wouldn't even be on Valve's own service yet. On Steam.
1360000	1362000	I'm sure it's just a little hold up.
1362000	1364000	It just says that the download content is not available yet.
1364000	1366000	Soon. Soon.
1366000	1367000	Maybe.
1367000	1373000	Alright, well we're going to get into a little segment we do here on Orange Launch Radio called Twitter Topics because...
1373000	1374000	Because we can.
1374000	1376000	Because we can. Basically that's what it boils down to.
1376000	1381000	We're bored and don't really know what else to talk about here on the show tonight because it's only been a couple days since our last show.
1381000	1384000	We go to Twitter and we say, hey guys, what do you guys want us to talk about tonight?
1384000	1389000	Because, you know, it's where every gamer has a voice and, sadly, we can't do calls tonight because we're not actually live.
1389000	1394000	There's another show going on on All Games right now, so we couldn't, you know, we don't have our own radio station anymore.
1394000	1396000	We can't just bust down the door and say, hey guys, we're live.
1396000	1400000	We could just go, hey, chat room, someone call us.
1400000	1406000	I guess we could go bust down the door on All Games, but I don't think the VGO fans would appreciate that.
1406000	1409000	Well, no, no, no. They can call our line.
1409000	1411000	We only have a couple of people on chat right now.
1411000	1415000	Well, I've been soliciting questions from chat, so we got plenty and plenty of questions from you.
1415000	1417000	By all means, Mr. Rob Korski.
1417000	1420000	Tweets and chatters and all this stuff.
1420000	1422000	Blue Swim is our first tweeter tonight.
1422000	1424000	We got a lot of tweet questions.
1424000	1427000	We got more, we got like twice as many as we usually do on a Sunday.
1427000	1428000	Really?
1428000	1430000	Maybe we need to move our show to Tuesday nights.
1430000	1431000	No.
1431000	1432000	Yeah, I know, I agree.
1432000	1438000	Blue Swim on the Twitter asks, what do you guys think of the natural disaster survival genre?
1438000	1445000	Twister the game with a flying cow and digital Helen Hunt tits equals epic win.
1445000	1447000	You know what, though?
1447000	1451000	If Loki were here, he would diss that game that Konami was showing at E3, which was something like that.
1451000	1453000	It was like a natural disaster game.
1453000	1455000	And there was one of those on Xbox Live not that long ago, too.
1455000	1459000	And neither one of those games was exactly as awesome as you would think.
1459000	1462000	And neither one had digital Helen Hunt tits, either.
1462000	1472000	The closest I've ever played that had natural disasters in it that I could stand was the tornado area in Sonic the Hedgehog on Dreamcast.
1472000	1474000	Because that was pretty freaking cool.
1474000	1477000	Other than that, suck!
1477000	1481000	Blue Swim goes on to say in a second tweet, after playing the PlayStation 2 game Raw Danger,
1481000	1486000	I'm convinced that the disaster genre has huge amounts of untapped potential.
1486000	1487000	I have to be honest.
1487000	1488000	Let's leave that untapped, please.
1488000	1490000	That's not a game I've ever played.
1490000	1492000	Is that something newer?
1492000	1494000	This is PlayStation 2.
1494000	1496000	I have no idea.
1496000	1501000	Gamer Girl on the Twitter asks, what was the first game anyone's ever played?
1501000	1503000	Ooh, that's tough.
1503000	1506000	I gotta go way back.
1506000	1508000	There's two.
1508000	1512000	The earliest memories, because, you know, I don't remember, unfortunately, far enough back.
1512000	1515000	You know, it's hard, because when you're that young, you don't remember everything.
1515000	1518000	But I would say I kind of have a memory of two games.
1518000	1522000	One of them would be Spider-Man on the Atari 2600.
1522000	1525000	It was one of the first games I ever remember playing.
1525000	1528000	And at the arcade, Crystal Castles.
1528000	1532000	I remember going to my sister's wedding reception.
1532000	1537000	And they had it, like, I don't want to say she had her wedding reception at Chuck E. Cheese,
1537000	1540000	but there was some type of, like, I think it was like a rehearsal party.
1540000	1543000	That's what it was. It was like a post-wedding rehearsal party.
1543000	1546000	I was, like, three, so I barely remember this.
1546000	1550000	But there was some type of, like, wedding rehearsal post-party, and it was at Chuck E. Cheese.
1550000	1553000	And I remember playing Crystal Castles, and I thought that game was the shit.
1553000	1559000	I remember being four and playing Pong on an arcade machine.
1559000	1563000	I grew up playing pinball, really.
1563000	1570000	As far as early memories, like, I remember being six
1570000	1575000	and going to play the Odyssey 2 at my friend's house next door.
1575000	1579000	And playing Casey Munchkin and Casey Crazychase.
1579000	1587000	And we also, you know, I had a Cliccovision when I was a kid.
1587000	1591000	I remember playing Atari a lot earlier, Atari 2600 a lot earlier,
1591000	1597000	because I remember playing Pitfall.
1597000	1599000	Who enabled your gaming addiction?
1599000	1603000	Because it doesn't sound like your mom was really that much into video games,
1603000	1606000	but yet you had all these systems that I never heard of.
1606000	1610000	My mom actually was kind of into games, you know.
1610000	1616000	Because keep in mind, when I was four, my mom was still in her early 20s.
1616000	1620000	You know, most of my childhood was spent with my mom in her 20s.
1620000	1624000	And so she liked to go out and have fun and liked games and played some pinball.
1624000	1628000	And when we'd go get pizza, she'd give me a few quarters
1628000	1634000	and leave me in the little game area so I could play the Mario one or play a kangaroo.
1634000	1638000	Kangaroo was, I was the shit at kangaroo.
1638000	1643000	I mean, over Godfather's Pizza back in the day in Mobile.
1643000	1644000	Wow.
1644000	1648000	And I've been a gamer practically since, you know,
1648000	1654000	I knew that turn this knob, the bar moves this way, you know.
1654000	1657000	Yeah, I have very early memories of Atari 2600 in much the same way.
1657000	1660000	I don't remember who got one for the family or how we got it,
1660000	1664000	but we had an Atari 2600 and my dad hooked it up so that, you know.
1664000	1666000	But it was hooked up in my mom's room, which I always thought was weird,
1666000	1670000	but I think that was so that if my dad wanted to watch TV
1670000	1672000	or somebody wanted to watch like a real show,
1672000	1676000	then I wouldn't be monopolizing the big television with video games.
1676000	1678000	I would always have to kind of like go in my mom's room to play,
1678000	1680000	and then she'd get mad if I don't ask first.
1680000	1688000	I also played a lot of Apple II games, like a lot of Kix, Load Runner.
1688000	1693000	I also grew up on the Carmen Sandiego games.
1693000	1695000	Yes, I played those too.
1695000	1697000	Oregon Trail.
1697000	1701000	Our family got a Commodore 64, Christmas 1983.
1701000	1705000	I remember that, that was a big, that would have been five at the time.
1705000	1707000	And that was like our first computer.
1707000	1711000	And honestly, between Atari 2600 and Nintendo Entertainment System,
1711000	1713000	that was my gaming platform.
1713000	1716000	When I was in second grade, we got our Cliccovision,
1716000	1719000	and we had the driving wheel and everything, and we set that up.
1719000	1722000	There's actually still pictures in one of my mom's photo albums
1722000	1727000	of me sitting on the floor playing mousetrap.
1727000	1739000	And her stupid ex-husband, Craphead, playing, he was really good at Carnival.
1739000	1741000	Oh, the little, is that the one where the clowns bounce up and down
1741000	1743000	and pop the balloons?
1743000	1747000	Yeah, it's this little glass thing shooting game.
1747000	1749000	Oh, no, I know.
1749000	1751000	Okay, I know what game you're talking about.
1751000	1752000	It's like an old ass shooting game.
1752000	1754000	Adventure was my game.
1754000	1756000	It was freaking hard too.
1756000	1759000	And what else did we have?
1759000	1761000	Gorf.
1761000	1762000	We had a stack of games.
1762000	1767000	I think that I have, we actually have my Cliccovision.
1767000	1772000	We got another one since then, but we actually have just my core Cliccovision.
1772000	1777000	And I might be permitted to part, I might be convinced to part with it.
1777000	1778000	What a trip down memory lane.
1778000	1779000	Thank you very much for the question, gamer girl.
1779000	1781000	It's in the vault somewhere.
1781000	1783000	I would love to hook up the old ass systems
1783000	1786000	and see how long some of those games can hold our attention today.
1786000	1789000	There's the point of actually having a TV that will run some of them.
1789000	1792000	Keep in mind, my Odyssey 2, we don't have a TV it works on.
1792000	1798000	Um, they take the RF, it's all RF, or the old coaxial cable thing, right?
1798000	1799000	The little hooky things.
1799000	1801000	That go with the coaxial cable, right?
1801000	1802000	Like hooking up cable.
1802000	1805000	Mmm, ye.
1805000	1806000	Right? Isn't that what they use?
1806000	1807000	No, no, no.
1807000	1808000	Really?
1808000	1811000	This had the little scoop things that you screwed into the back of your TV.
1811000	1812000	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
1812000	1813000	The antenna.
1813000	1814000	Yeah, that's what I'm talking about.
1814000	1817000	Oh, I thought you were talking about the cable type coax.
1817000	1819000	No, no, it's uh...
1819000	1821000	Yeah, that screws into the little converter box.
1821000	1822000	Yep, yep, yep.
1822000	1823000	The switch, the RF switch, yeah.
1823000	1824000	So those, um...
1824000	1826000	My Nintendo had one of those.
1826000	1829000	You know, those TVs are going to actually be really easy to find now
1829000	1831000	because a lot of them, because of the whole digital TV transition,
1831000	1832000	They're obsolete.
1832000	1833000	They're obsolete.
1833000	1834000	So what else are they good for but playing...
1834000	1835000	Thrift store!
1835000	1836000	Yeah, seriously.
1836000	1838000	Anyhow, let's move on with some other questions.
1838000	1839000	That was a lot.
1839000	1841000	Takeo Ray wanted to plug his Extra Life donation page.
1841000	1843000	The URL is very long.
1843000	1845000	I'll go ahead and read it here because obviously Extra Life
1845000	1847000	was something we wanted to be involved with.
1847000	1849000	Unfortunately, we had to back out as shared on the last show,
1849000	1852000	which sucks, but we are still supporting the cause, certainly.
1852000	1857000	Takeo Ray's page is at waystogive.texaschildrens.org
1857000	1862000	slash netcommunity slash Allen, A-L-L-E-N, Ray, R-E-Y.
1862000	1863000	That's all one word.
1863000	1865000	A-L-L-E-N, R-E-Y.
1865000	1867000	I do want to say, though, if you just want to check out
1867000	1868000	what Extra Life's all about in general,
1868000	1871000	I'm sure Takeo Ray would not mind if you just donate
1871000	1873000	to somebody that's participating,
1873000	1876000	extralife.sarcasticgamer.com.
1876000	1879000	Sarcastic Gamer, of course, being another podcast.
1879000	1881000	I've never listened to it,
1881000	1883000	so I couldn't tell you what they're about.
1883000	1885000	That's not a slam on that show.
1885000	1887000	I don't listen to pretty much any other podcast,
1887000	1890000	but Bobby, because he's on before us,
1890000	1892000	that's just because I want to make sure
1892000	1895000	we don't inadvertently copy somebody else.
1895000	1897000	I would hate for that to happen.
1897000	1898000	Exactly.
1898000	1901000	But I'm sure they're sarcastic.
1901000	1902000	It is in the title.
1902000	1905000	No.
1905000	1907000	I don't know how to pronounce this name,
1907000	1908000	but I'll try.
1908000	1911000	Sponchtwang, S-P-O-N-C-H-T-W-A-N-G.
1911000	1912000	Sponchtwang?
1912000	1913000	Close enough.
1913000	1915000	What do you guys think about Konami rolling out
1915000	1917000	the official DDR tourney?
1917000	1918000	You know, Konami announced...
1918000	1919000	What?
1919000	1922000	They are doing an official DDR tournament
1922000	1924000	that is going to be in certain cities across the US,
1924000	1929000	and it all kind of comes to a head at an official Vegas tournament.
1929000	1931000	But in order to go to the one in Vegas,
1931000	1933000	you have to win one of the satellite competitions that's happening.
1933000	1934000	Qualifiers.
1934000	1935000	Yeah, basically.
1935000	1937000	I don't think there is one happening in NorCal.
1937000	1939000	I think the closest one is in the LA area.
1939000	1943000	That's a shame, because a bunch of the really good...
1943000	1944000	I may be wrong. Please don't quote me on that.
1944000	1946000	I don't have the site up in front of me, but yeah.
1946000	1948000	I think a lot of the...
1948000	1950000	I mean, this comes from watching a lot of videos
1950000	1952000	and seeing a lot of people.
1952000	1954000	But really, do you think that some of the best players
1954000	1956000	were in the Bay Area?
1956000	1960000	I think it's good that Konami is finally doing this.
1960000	1963000	I think they're honestly, sadly, about five years too late.
1963000	1965000	I think this is something they should have done
1965000	1967000	when Extreme was out, but fair enough.
1967000	1969000	They're trying to promote some of their new DDR games.
1969000	1971000	I think the one mistake they're making...
1971000	1974000	They didn't give a lot of notice before this tournament happened.
1974000	1976000	It was literally like,
1976000	1979000	hey, this is going to start in Texas next week.
1979000	1981000	It really came out of nowhere,
1981000	1983000	and I think that's probably one of the biggest mistakes they made.
1983000	1985000	Whereas if they just would have given it a little time,
1985000	1987000	like maybe a month to build...
1987000	1989000	And maybe they did have it out,
1989000	1991000	and I just didn't hear about it until a week before,
1991000	1993000	but I don't think there was a lot of notice,
1993000	1995000	because I want to say the first thing I read on DDRFreak
1995000	1997000	said it was like, this weekend.
1997000	2001000	But I think if they'd given it a little more time to breathe,
2001000	2003000	let the media cover it a little bit.
2003000	2005000	Let some of the blogs...
2005000	2007000	Because here's the thing, none of the blogs,
2007000	2009000	the big, big blogs have said anything about it,
2009000	2011000	which is unfortunate, because, you know,
2011000	2013000	you would hope that something like this
2013000	2015000	would gain a little more notoriety and steam.
2015000	2017000	This should be a huge tournament.
2017000	2019000	This should be the size of the tournament
2019000	2021000	at the end of The Wizard, the movie.
2021000	2024000	Super Mario 3.
2024000	2026000	It's so bad.
2026000	2029000	Von Johnson on Twitter wants to know,
2029000	2031000	what do you guys think about Borderlands?
2031000	2033000	You know, I don't know much about this game,
2033000	2035000	but I did a little bit of research,
2035000	2037000	just because of your Twitter question.
2037000	2040000	It's a person shooter, but it also has RPG elements mixed in.
2040000	2043000	It's being made by Gearbox, and 2K is publishing it,
2043000	2045000	and it's coming out on PC, of course.
2045000	2048000	PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, it's coming out in October.
2048000	2050000	They want to make a franchise out of it,
2050000	2052000	and honestly, when I'm first looking at this,
2052000	2054000	just the box art and even some of the screenshots,
2054000	2057000	I'm kind of like, they're kind of going for the Fallout audience.
2057000	2060000	This looks a lot like kind of what Fallout is all about.
2060000	2062000	If I want a Fallout game, I'll play Fallout.
2062000	2064000	But, you know, it's certainly...
2064000	2066000	And then I'll throw up, because I get motion sick.
2066000	2069000	You should know, it does do random level generation.
2069000	2071000	It's kind of got something like Diablo.
2071000	2073000	They're kind of saying it was like that.
2073000	2075000	So, you know, certainly this has its own merits,
2075000	2077000	so things like that.
2077000	2080000	A content creation system, which will influence some of the weapons
2080000	2083000	that you see in game and the game world and the map.
2083000	2086000	So it sounds like this is something that's going to kind of develop
2086000	2088000	uniquely for each person.
2088000	2090000	That sounds kind of cool, especially for an RPG.
2090000	2092000	That's a little weird.
2092000	2094000	Weren't some of the dungeons in Fantasy Star,
2094000	2096000	the earlier Fantasy Star games?
2096000	2098000	Mmm, that might be true. I think you might be right.
2098000	2099000	Random generated?
2099000	2101000	I think it's a nod back to some of the old RPGs,
2101000	2104000	but even so, if it's a first person shooter,
2104000	2106000	I'm not going to be into it.
2106000	2108000	I also do want to point out, though, it has player versus player in it,
2108000	2111000	which is certainly a huge element that I don't believe Fallout has.
2111000	2115000	You can actually melee another player to issue a challenge,
2115000	2117000	and then there'll be a one-on-one duel.
2117000	2121000	You go to arenas and competitively play with other people.
2121000	2123000	Fight to the death.
2123000	2126000	This certainly sounds like kind of an original game,
2126000	2129000	even though we're making jokes that it sounds a lot like Fallout.
2129000	2131000	It definitely sounds like it has some unique features
2131000	2133000	that try to make it set it apart.
2133000	2135000	So hopefully they release a demo.
2135000	2137000	That would be my biggest thing.
2137000	2139000	I probably still wouldn't try it out.
2139000	2141000	Well, you have the whole motion sick thing going on.
2141000	2143000	You just don't play first person shooters in general.
2143000	2147000	I don't play a lot, but there are a few that I got really into,
2147000	2148000	but most of them are old.
2148000	2151000	And then they're going to be anytime soon, as long as Dan's got ODST.
2151000	2153000	Quake, Duke Nukem, 3D.
2153000	2155000	Those are the games I'm talking about that I got into.
2155000	2156000	I haven't gotten into a shooter.
2156000	2157000	I played a little bit of Halo.
2157000	2160000	The last one I played any severe amount of was Hexen.
2160000	2163000	Now that is an old school shooting game.
2163000	2166000	I wish there would be a game like that again.
2166000	2169000	Like the whole magical, mystical first person shooter type of thing.
2169000	2170000	That was a rad game.
2170000	2171000	Hexen was great.
2171000	2173000	Just the whole problem being, you know,
2173000	2177000	that was still sprite based and, you know.
2177000	2181000	Wasn't Heretic 2 the one that they did?
2181000	2182000	They moved to 3D?
2182000	2185000	Yes.
2185000	2189000	Doctor of War C, or Doctor of Work on Twitter,
2189000	2191000	who has a cute little chibi squirtle icon,
2191000	2194000	wants to know the last CD or song you bought.
2194000	2196000	I said anything goes.
2196000	2198000	Last CD or song you bought.
2198000	2202000	Um... physical CD?
2202000	2205000	Oh god, I can't even remember the last physical CD I bought.
2205000	2206000	That was too long ago.
2206000	2207000	I can tell you the last... go ahead.
2207000	2209000	The World's Greatest Mashups Part 2.
2209000	2210000	Really?
2210000	2211000	Yes.
2211000	2212000	Nice.
2212000	2219000	As far as an actual song, I bought actually what my cage match pick was.
2219000	2221000	Which didn't win, I'm sorry to tell you.
2221000	2224000	Loki picked some song out of thin air and we both lost by one vote.
2224000	2225000	He pulled it out of his ass.
2225000	2226000	He did. He always does.
2226000	2228000	But it was all the Kylie stuff.
2228000	2229000	Yeah.
2229000	2232000	I would say the last song I bought, funny enough,
2232000	2233000	there's a story behind this.
2233000	2236000	The last song I bought was Limbo Rock by Chubby Checker.
2236000	2238000	Yes, that's right.
2238000	2240000	No joke. Go back.
2240000	2242000	It's in my iTunes receipt.
2242000	2246000	Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo.
2246000	2248000	I wish I had it on this computer. I'd play it.
2248000	2250000	But it was actually, it was for Rocky.
2250000	2254000	I bought it because there was a new little pre-show game we did
2254000	2256000	that was the Limbo, so I had to get the song for that.
2256000	2257000	But that's the last song I bought.
2257000	2258000	What was your last physical CD?
2258000	2260000	I don't remember the last physical CD.
2260000	2263000	The last iTunes CD I bought was Ellipse by Image and Heap.
2263000	2264000	I know that.
2264000	2266000	But as far as CD I actually...
2266000	2272000	Oh, so the last download CD that I got was Regina Spector.
2272000	2277000	I actually think the last physical CD I bought was
2277000	2280000	Flavors of Entanglement by Alanis Morissette,
2280000	2282000	and that came out like a year ago.
2282000	2283000	I just don't really buy physical CDs.
2283000	2285000	Now that I think about it, I'm pretty sure that it wasn't,
2285000	2288000	the mashups disc was the last one that I bought.
2288000	2290000	But I'll be damned if I can remember what it is.
2290000	2292000	I know what it was, Video Games Live.
2292000	2293000	Oh.
2293000	2295000	I bought it at...
2295000	2296000	There you go.
2296000	2297000	At the concert.
2297000	2298000	There you go.
2298000	2302000	And that's a great place to get physical CDs,
2302000	2305000	is at concerts, because sometimes you can get them to sign them there.
2305000	2307000	SimsLovah wants to know,
2307000	2310000	what games are you excited about for next month?
2310000	2312000	I'm still catching up on last month.
2312000	2314000	I haven't been able to play crap.
2314000	2316000	You were out because of your hand.
2316000	2319000	Yep. I am still kind of out on my hand.
2319000	2321000	You never even played Marvel Ultimate Alliance, did you?
2321000	2323000	No. In fact, look. Right here.
2323000	2324000	Look at this.
2324000	2326000	Oh my god, a sealed copy.
2326000	2330000	And I really freaking want to play it so I can get my Deadpool on.
2330000	2331000	Poor thing.
2331000	2334000	I think my team is going to be Deadpool and
2334000	2341000	Ms. Marvel and Phoenix and Captain America.
2341000	2343000	I never played Ultimate Alliance 1.
2343000	2345000	So when you finally crack that open, I need to come over and play it with you.
2345000	2348000	Yes you do, because I'm going to need you to help me pass the levels
2348000	2351000	and get me achievements and whatnot.
2351000	2352000	Look, Deadpool.
2352000	2354000	What if I suck at it? I've never played it.
2354000	2356000	Trust me, there's no real way to suck at this game.
2356000	2357000	It's just butt mashing?
2357000	2358000	It's mashing.
2358000	2359000	Alright, fine.
2359000	2363000	Really, in looking at the releases, DJ Hero clearly is a game I want to get.
2363000	2365000	Also, kind of slipping under the radar,
2365000	2367000	there's a lot of big releases between Gran Turismo, PSP,
2367000	2370000	Uncharted 2 certainly is going to be worth a look.
2370000	2373000	But I do want to point out Demon's Souls is coming out on the PlayStation 3.
2373000	2375000	That was a game I checked out at E3.
2375000	2377000	I think it's been out in Japan for a little while,
2377000	2378000	but they're adapting it over here.
2378000	2380000	It's like an RPG, but it's supposed to be super hard.
2380000	2383000	And especially with White Knight Chronicles getting pushed back to next year,
2383000	2385000	I think I do want to pick up Demon's Souls and check it out.
2385000	2390000	That's actually a PlayStation 3 exclusive, if I remember correct.
2390000	2392000	Nutman wants to know in chat.
2392000	2393000	Yes, that's the name.
2393000	2394000	I'm sorry, not chat.
2394000	2395000	That's Twitter again.
2395000	2399000	For Rob, a question just for me.
2399000	2401000	Would you go straight for Alicia Keys?
2401000	2403000	Be honest.
2403000	2407000	No, I have to say no.
2407000	2409000	Not for Alicia Keys.
2409000	2414000	And I could get into this whole tirade about I don't really believe there is
2414000	2417000	going straight in quotes or going gay.
2417000	2421000	There is just liking who you want to like, as I call it.
2421000	2427000	I go ahead and classify myself gay because I like guys, mostly.
2427000	2433000	But I'm not going to say I would never, ever, ever, ever, ever want to kiss a girl.
2433000	2436000	You have a witness in this room.
2436000	2440000	But Alicia Keys I don't think would be the one, that's for sure.
2440000	2444000	Anyhow, I'll save the sexuality tangent for another day.
2444000	2447000	I don't think people signed up for this podcast to hear that talk.
2447000	2449000	I don't think she's that cute.
2449000	2452000	Petrek85 wants to know, um, duh, guh.
2452000	2453000	That's exactly what they put.
2453000	2454000	Um, duh, guh.
2454000	2456000	What's your favorite colors?
2456000	2457000	New game smell.
2457000	2458000	Ooh, new game smell.
2458000	2459000	She unwrapped.
2459000	2460000	Favorite color?
2460000	2461000	Black.
2461000	2464000	Like my soul!
2464000	2466000	Uh, dark forest green.
2466000	2468000	I'm actually really fond of dark, dark red.
2468000	2474000	There's actually an in-joke amongst a lot of my friends that I always wear earth colors.
2474000	2480000	Like, I pretty much always am wearing brown, green, black, you know, like earthy colors.
2480000	2481000	You're not today.
2481000	2483000	Funny enough, today I'm wearing all blue.
2483000	2486000	I have a, like, little blue stripey shirt and blue jeans on today.
2486000	2488000	I'm wearing gray.
2488000	2490000	Even down to my warm fuzzy socks.
2490000	2492000	It's like the weather today, but the weather today is gray.
2492000	2493000	Are you feeling okay?
2493000	2497000	I just grabbed something comfortable to paint in because I have my class today.
2497000	2498000	Nice.
2498000	2503000	I have to, I tend to wear my older clothes on Tuesdays and Thursdays because I know that
2503000	2506000	I'm just gonna go get paint all over them, which amazingly enough I didn't get any paint
2506000	2508000	on myself today.
2508000	2509000	Uh-
2509000	2511000	Acrylic is a bitch to wash out.
2511000	2514000	I got one more question on the Twitter that just came in a little bit ago while we've
2514000	2516000	been taping, and I'll give this one more reload before we sign off tonight.
2516000	2517000	This is fun.
2517000	2519000	I like this for a random show when there's not a lot of news.
2519000	2520000	Um, okay.
2520000	2521000	Soda or pop?
2521000	2522000	Asks spazinator.
2522000	2524000	PSN on Twitter.
2524000	2525000	I, soda.
2525000	2526000	Easy.
2526000	2528000	I hate, I hate pop.
2528000	2530000	I hate it when people call it pop.
2530000	2531000	Like, it just bugs me.
2531000	2532000	It's like nails on a chalkboard.
2532000	2534000	Pop is what you do to bubble gum.
2534000	2537000	Pop is what you do to bubbles when somebody blows them.
2537000	2538000	Technically-
2538000	2539000	Pop goes the weasel.
2539000	2540000	The name is soda pop.
2540000	2541000	I get that, but it just sounds weird.
2541000	2545000	But, this is where I start giving the cultural lesson on growing up in Alabama.
2545000	2546000	Mm-hmm.
2546000	2551000	Because my little, especially my part of Alabama had Coca-Cola bottling company plant.
2551000	2559000	So every drink, every soda in, and yes, I do prefer soda, every soda in the South is
2559000	2560000	called Coke.
2560000	2561000	It doesn't matter.
2561000	2562000	It's all Coke.
2562000	2566000	And I'm okay with that even, even though I prefer Pepsi.
2566000	2568000	Pepsi is so much better because Coke tastes like poo.
2568000	2574000	But, but now though, when I go into a restaurant and it throws people off so much.
2574000	2575000	Let's see.
2575000	2577000	Um, you know, can I get you a drink?
2577000	2579000	I'd like a Diet Cola.
2579000	2580000	Ah, Cola.
2580000	2582000	That's one you don't hear a lot.
2582000	2586000	Because I don't like, I don't really care for the Sprite type drinks, you know.
2586000	2590000	But I'll say I would like a Diet Cola, whichever one you have.
2590000	2593000	So that way they won't do, is Coke okay?
2593000	2594000	Is Pepsi okay?
2594000	2596000	I just said whichever one.
2596000	2598000	I don't care.
2598000	2601000	You know, there's a, you know, they have to do that though, because plenty of people bitch
2601000	2602000	about it when it's not the right one.
2602000	2607000	But, but I, that's why I specify and you've heard me do it.
2607000	2610000	I will take a Diet Cola, whichever one you have.
2610000	2612000	That's a blanket permission.
2612000	2618000	If you don't have Coke or Pepsi, but you have RC Cola, by all means, give me the RC.
2618000	2623000	Which by the way, I was going to say, when I hear the word Cola, I think of RC Cola and
2623000	2627000	I think of Shasta Cola, which I don't even think they probably sell outside of Merkle.
2627000	2630000	Do you remember Faggo?
2630000	2631000	Root beer.
2631000	2633000	That would be, what about just saying root beer?
2633000	2634000	Here's the thing though.
2634000	2638000	Honestly, Spasinator, if I was smarter, I wouldn't order soda at all.
2638000	2641000	Honestly, soda's not really that good for you.
2641000	2644000	You really shouldn't have more than one a day.
2644000	2648000	So just kind of throwing that out there, because I know that with the whole video game stereotype,
2648000	2650000	there's people that chug Mountain Dew's.
2650000	2654000	So if you know you're the type of person that chugs Mountain Dew's, and then you're like,
2654000	2656000	when did my butt get so big?
2656000	2658000	Then it's probably because you're chugging Mountain Dew's.
2658000	2660000	So not to slam on Mountain Dew.
2660000	2662000	I love those drinks as much as anyone else.
2662000	2664000	But seriously, look how many calories are in one of those.
2664000	2669000	There's as much calories in one of those drinks as there is in a candy bar.
2669000	2675000	Rob, I have to give up my diet soda and my coffee and black tea.
2675000	2677000	Oh my gosh, you poor thing.
2677000	2678000	I can have green tea.
2678000	2680000	Can you have Sprite?
2680000	2683000	What's the point? Caffeine.
2683000	2687000	The only type of caffeinated drink I'm supposed to have is green tea.
2687000	2689000	I'm like, the hell with that. I'm having coffee.
2689000	2693000	But I'll have my one cup of coffee in the morning. One.
2693000	2696000	We got a few good questions from our chat room, actually.
2696000	2697000	Who cares? Bye.
2697000	2700000	Shut up. I was talking with a few of the chatters before the show,
2700000	2702000	and actually we got some really good questions from chat.
2702000	2705000	Three of them came from the Rob D, but these are all good discussion questions.
2705000	2708000	Rob D's just a smart and articulate guy, anyway.
2708000	2711000	I really enjoy when he calls into the show. He's a smart guy,
2711000	2714000	and obviously I've gotten to hang out with him a couple times.
2714000	2715000	Penny Arcade Expo.
2715000	2716000	We had really good Chinese food.
2716000	2718000	And Asen. I got to see him again.
2718000	2721000	So he's a good guy. I wish his show would come back.
2721000	2726000	That was a slick show, this day in gaming that he had.
2726000	2728000	I was trying to remember what it stood for.
2728000	2730000	This day in gaming that he had, it was a slick show.
2730000	2734000	He has a really good voice for radio, and the guy that edited it did a really good job.
2734000	2738000	Anyhow, Rob D asks in chat, first thing he said,
2738000	2742000	what is your favorite Japanese media depiction of an American?
2742000	2744000	That's a good question.
2744000	2748000	Mine is and will forever be Terry Bogard.
2748000	2751000	I don't know. This is one I'd really have to give some thought to.
2751000	2753000	I can't think of any big stereotypes that jump out at me.
2753000	2759000	I would have to say from Axis Powers Hetalia, America,
2759000	2762000	who is always sitting in the corner eating cheeseburgers
2762000	2766000	and giving emphatic orders.
2766000	2768000	I'm going to take the question in a different direction here.
2768000	2771000	It's not my favorite Japanese media depiction of an American,
2771000	2776000	but my favorite British depiction of an American was Bubbles from Absolutely Fabulous.
2776000	2779000	I'm sure none of our listeners are going to get that reference,
2779000	2784000	but that was my favorite depiction of an American.
2784000	2788000	The only thing that's coming to mind, and it's not even her depicting an American,
2788000	2794000	it's her depicting a Welsh.
2794000	2800000	It's Dawn French doing her imitation of Catherine Zeta Jones,
2800000	2804000	but slipping into a fully California American axis.
2804000	2807000	She says, oh, my California's showing.
2807000	2809000	Nice.
2809000	2812000	I have to do it right.
2812000	2814000	Catherine Zeta Douglas.
2814000	2816000	I lost it.
2816000	2818000	Is this something people can look up on YouTube or something?
2818000	2820000	Catherine Zeta Douglas Spartacus Jones.
2820000	2821000	Spartacus Jones?
2821000	2822000	Yes.
2822000	2823000	Nice.
2823000	2827000	Just look up Dawn French or French and Saunders and Catherine Zeta Jones.
2827000	2829000	It's hilarious.
2829000	2831000	Especially the roundabout one.
2831000	2832000	That one's funny.
2832000	2835000	Here's another good question from our articulate friend.
2835000	2840000	Overall, do you think the internet gaming community has helped or stunted the gaming industry?
2840000	2844000	I see the zeitgeist that has sprung up from the sites and forums we have today,
2844000	2846000	and honestly, it makes me sad.
2846000	2852000	Everyone complains about everything, and that drives sales down because of social pressure.
2852000	2861000	I think it's a necessary evil, and I know that's totally like I just picked none of the above in a way,
2861000	2866000	which is sad, but the problem is that it's not just the gaming industry that I think has to deal with this.
2866000	2870000	The movie industry, to a certain extent, definitely has to deal with this big time.
2870000	2875000	Sites like Ain'tItCoolNews.com or everybody's got a movie blog, it seems these days,
2875000	2882000	and bitchy people like Perez Hilton and some of these gossip blogs will oftentimes ruin a movie
2882000	2886000	before it comes out with spoilers and things that it stinks.
2886000	2887000	Think about it.
2887000	2891000	I know most of us, even I'm too young to remember this,
2891000	2899000	but when The Empire Strikes Back originally came out, or no, Return of the Jedi originally came out,
2899000	2902000	and it was revealed that Darth Vader was Luke's father.
2902000	2904000	That was Empire Strikes Back.
2904000	2905000	Sorry, leading into Return of the Jedi.
2905000	2907000	I remember this.
2907000	2910000	That was such a huge fucking thing.
2910000	2914000	Like, oh my gosh, what a shock, what a surprise.
2914000	2916000	That would not be possible in this day and age.
2916000	2917000	Think about it.
2917000	2921000	A huge reveal like that would have been spoiled on the internet a month before the movie was released.
2921000	2923000	Snape killed Dumbledore.
2923000	2924000	Exactly.
2924000	2927000	It was on T-shirts by the time the book came out.
2927000	2929000	Snape kills Dumbledore, page 200 and something something.
2929000	2932000	And sorry if that was truly a spoiler to you, but seriously, how long has it been on you?
2932000	2937000	If you haven't read it by now, there's got to be some type of moratorium on spoilers.
2937000	2941000	Like, if it's been out for two years and you still haven't done it, you're going to get spoiled.
2941000	2946000	Well, that's why I did very well to hide myself.
2946000	2952000	I mean, even though I figured out that something like that was going to happen from the freaking beginning of the damn book,
2952000	2959000	hi, especially when the last book came out.
2959000	2967000	I hid myself in a hole and made sure to read everything that day before I let myself read anything on the internet.
2967000	2973000	But it's interesting because even though you know that, and even if I just spoiled that for you,
2973000	2979000	which I'm sure I wasn't the first person to do so, that's not going to ruin what was a good book.
2979000	2985000	Just like knowing that Darth Vader is Luke's father is not going to ruin that movie.
2985000	2989000	It's still a good movie and really good stuff will hold up amongst all the spoilers.
2989000	2991000	But I'm digressing a little bit. I apologize.
2991000	2995000	I'm just kind of trying to say this isn't really something that's specific to the gaming industry, in my opinion.
2995000	3005000	This is internet culture and live performances, television, every artistic foray,
3005000	3008000	which yes, gaming is one. We can have that discussion another day if you want.
3008000	3015000	It is subject to this scrutiny that is the blogosphere that we live in now.
3015000	3017000	It's just the way it is.
3017000	3022000	I think companies to overcome that kind of have to be smart in how they do things.
3022000	3024000	But it's really hard to keep a secret.
3024000	3030000	Look at what happened to Sony and having everything spoiled, except Final Fantasy XIV was one of the only secrets they had.
3030000	3033000	Most of their big things were spoiled.
3033000	3037000	And now you had this whole Sega Sony thing we talked about on the show last week.
3037000	3039000	That was a huge spoiler thing, too.
3039000	3041000	It's very hard to keep a secret anymore.
3041000	3044000	But if the product is really, really good, it's going to transcend all that.
3044000	3046000	Yeah, I totally agree with that.
3046000	3051000	Because how many people who had their Harry Potter spoilers still went out and got the book?
3051000	3055000	So going back to the original question, because we totally digressed from the question and probably missed the point.
3055000	3059000	Has the gaming community helped or stunted the gaming industry?
3059000	3061000	In the end, it doesn't matter.
3061000	3063000	It's not a switch we can turn off.
3063000	3068000	But I would honestly say the answer is a little of column A and a little of column B.
3068000	3073000	It's probably made things better as far as promoting.
3073000	3084000	I think games like Scribblenauts, Braid, some of these games, I don't think would have sold as well or been quite as talked about if it weren't for the internet.
3084000	3089000	I think the concepts of some of these games wouldn't have even existed if not for the internet.
3089000	3095000	Scribblenauts itself has so many internet jokes in it. Hi!
3095000	3097000	But has it hurt things? Sure.
3097000	3099000	Has it hurt sales of some games? Sure.
3099000	3104000	But honestly, I don't even know if that's the blog so much as it is probably just piracy.
3104000	3107000	Straight up piracy is easy to do, you know?
3107000	3109000	Anyhow, that's a good question.
3109000	3111000	Want to do one more from the Rob D?
3111000	3112000	Sure.
3112000	3115000	Along the same lines, has online multiplayer helped or hurt gaming?
3115000	3120000	Before, a good game could have glitches and they would be ignored or even revered.
3120000	3126000	Now people will complain that it needs a patch because it will be abused if there's an online component.
3126000	3131000	I think it's just a sign of the times. I mean, I really think that it's just the evolution.
3131000	3136000	You know, you move in one direction, you're going to have problems that come because of it, you know?
3136000	3139000	I really think that you can't have one without the other.
3139000	3142000	So I don't really see it as a hurt or help.
3142000	3148000	I'm going to plant myself firmly in the column of I believe multiplayer gaming has helped gaming altogether.
3148000	3152000	I think it's created genres of gaming that really wouldn't exist otherwise.
3152000	3154000	I think it hurt arcades.
3154000	3158000	I think multiplayer gaming and the online stuff, I think it hurt arcades.
3158000	3160000	And I think that's what finally put the nail in the coffin of arcades.
3160000	3162000	I think it hurt people's social life.
3162000	3165000	But I think it helped gaming in general.
3165000	3168000	I mean, let's face it. What is the Xbox 360's biggest strength?
3168000	3169000	Online.
3169000	3173000	Online is online. And what is a lot of people, you know, what made it so successful,
3173000	3176000	especially in the beginning over the PlayStation 3,
3176000	3183000	complain all you will about how Sony maybe botched the launch of the PlayStation 3 that they're trying to make amends for now.
3183000	3187000	But the online component has always been Xbox 360's greatest strength.
3187000	3191000	What is the one thing most of us are most critical about with the Wii?
3191000	3192000	The lack of online.
3192000	3196000	The lack of online and the lack of ability to patch games and the lack of, you know,
3196000	3200000	we kind of see that as not catering to the hardcore audience.
3200000	3205000	They said, though, from the get-go that it's not for the hardcore audience.
3205000	3210000	But honestly, I've kind of made friends with online games, as strange as that sounds.
3210000	3211000	I know, I have.
3211000	3216000	Yeah, I mean, I've met people on, like, LiveJournal that I'll go off and, you know,
3216000	3221000	join my guild in Final Fantasy XI or World of Warcraft or what have you that I've become really good friends with.
3221000	3227000	Well, just along the same token, a lot of the people that I've made friends with out here,
3227000	3232000	they were my online buddies in Alabama, you know, through playing Gemstone.
3232000	3233000	Oh, wow.
3233000	3234000	How's that for old school?
3234000	3235000	That is very old school.
3235000	3239000	Or, you know, doing the silly little games on AOL, you know.
3239000	3241000	Nice.
3241000	3247000	I met a lot of people who are now my in-person friends, but I met them online.
3247000	3249000	You know, Dan.
3249000	3250000	Your husband you met online.
3250000	3251000	My husband, I met online.
3251000	3257000	So, I think that while this may have hurt face-to-face social interaction,
3257000	3264000	I think that it has opened the doors for people who otherwise would not get out of the house, you know.
3264000	3267000	I'm trying to think if I want to open this little Pandora's box here,
3267000	3272000	but let me kind of take a step away from gaming for a minute and this whole, like, internet social thing.
3272000	3275000	As a gay man, the internet's been huge.
3275000	3282000	Because I think especially, like, you know, where it's not something you can just...
3282000	3287000	It's sometimes kind of hard to meet other gay people because not everybody kind of is, like, out with it
3287000	3289000	and a lot of people have to suppress it out there in society.
3289000	3291000	I think the internet's helped a lot of people connect.
3291000	3293000	And I don't think that's necessarily limited to gay culture.
3293000	3298000	That goes for a lot of, like, fans of anything.
3298000	3300000	Or lifestyle...
3300000	3303000	Well, a lot of fringe groups too, you know.
3303000	3306000	People who may think, oh, I'm the only one, I'm the only one.
3306000	3310000	You find out there's other people like you, you know.
3310000	3320000	I think it's fantastic for, especially not just as a social tool, but as a socially informative tool, you know what I mean?
3320000	3324000	So in a way, what Jamie and I are saying right here kind of goes back to answer this question.
3324000	3329000	Because gaming would be another type of community where you're able to find people like you,
3329000	3332000	you know, that are into the same types of games that you are.
3332000	3334000	You know, kind of combining them both.
3334000	3339000	One of the most, one of my favorite websites, the most awesome communities I've been to is gaygamer.net.
3339000	3345000	You know, because I'm able to meet, like, other gay geeks like myself, which is ironic because I actually don't go there a whole lot anymore.
3345000	3348000	But I went to, like, a party they had once and I had a lot of fun.
3348000	3354000	And it was kind of cool because, you know, sometimes in gamer culture, I feel like the underdog for being gay
3354000	3357000	and you sign on Xbox Live, fag, fag, fag, you know, you hear all that stuff.
3357000	3361000	And then as the gay guy, I sometimes feel like being a nerd, I'm on the bottom rung.
3361000	3366000	Because I'm not a fashionista. I don't, you know, go to every Madonna concert and all this stuff.
3366000	3367000	You know what I mean?
3367000	3368000	I know what you mean.
3368000	3372000	That's why I rolled my eyes because I see way too much of it, you know.
3372000	3377000	Don't cry for me, Argentina. This happens in any social structure, not just the ones I've mentioned.
3377000	3381000	But I think the internet has allowed us to find people like us and gaming is a part of that.
3381000	3385000	Think about it. What about the community we have here at Orange Lounge Radio?
3385000	3388000	We've met a lot of awesome people just because they've listened to our show.
3388000	3391000	She's an example directly through a game.
3391000	3396000	One of my friends that I played on the IRO back in the day, on the International Ragnarok Server,
3396000	3400000	she's, we haven't met, you know, she lives in Canada, so we haven't met face to face.
3400000	3401000	I've never been up there.
3401000	3407000	But we're still friends on DeviantArt and through LiveJournal, you know, we still keep in touch.
3407000	3411000	And I'm talking, you know, seven years ago.
3411000	3418000	So I've made, even though, you know, these are people that I would never have come into contact with,
3418000	3427000	people of vast talent, like, you know, for example, I met Tiara online.
3427000	3432000	You know, we were friends online before we'd ever gotten to meet in person.
3432000	3439000	And, you know, now, you know, we hang out whenever we can go to each other's towns or go to Disneyland.
3439000	3441000	But it's pretty cool, you know.
3441000	3449000	I've made really lasting friendships through, you know, online networking and through, you know, games.
3449000	3452000	So, meh.
3452000	3454000	One more question tonight.
3454000	3456000	That was a good discussion.
3456000	3458000	This one comes from Dark Tetsuya.
3458000	3464000	And the question is, how likely are you guys to be checking out La Mulana when it hits WiiWare when it's available?
3464000	3468000	I did read the difficulty, at least of the controls, has been adjusted.
3468000	3471000	I really wish there were demos, but that's a whole bigger issue.
3471000	3475000	I still have some extra Wii points from a gift card someone was kind enough to give me for my birthday,
3475000	3477000	so I'll probably use it to pick up this game.
3477000	3479000	Because I do love kind of the retro gamey goodness.
3479000	3484000	And what I've seen of La Mulana, I've actually watched Dark Tetsuya play a little bit of it on his channel.
3484000	3487000	It looks fun, so I'll check it out. Why not?
3487000	3491000	It has to be better than that BitBoy game I can't believe I actually spent points on.
3491000	3494000	I'm still thinking about it.
3494000	3501000	Just right now, me playing much of anything is in small doses that I have to be able to take a lot of rest with.
3501000	3504000	Why isn't there a Nintendo magazine that comes with demos?
3504000	3507000	You know, they do this on the Xbox. They do this on the PlayStation.
3507000	3513000	Granted, those discs got made a little obsolete in this era of gaming because we all download our demos online.
3513000	3516000	But remember on PlayStation 1, those demo discs used to be the shit.
3516000	3518000	I have a pile of them.
3518000	3519000	They're awesome.
3519000	3524000	Why doesn't Nintendo do something like that to make up for the lack of having an online thing?
3524000	3526000	I don't get that.
3526000	3530000	Wouldn't that be cool if they had a magazine that would have like five games you could play on a disc?
3530000	3532000	They're too busy kissing Miyamoto's ass.
3532000	3536000	Or kissing Soccer Mom's ass or something. I don't know.
3536000	3539000	Let me just reload the Twitter real quick to see if we got any other last questions.
3539000	3540000	No, we didn't.
3540000	3542000	Jeremy keeps trying to get out of the room and then she's like,
3542000	3544000	Ah, the door!
3544000	3546000	And then turning back around.
3546000	3549000	I think we're going to go ahead and wrap up. We've been taping for about an hour now.
3549000	3551000	Are we going to wrap it up in ribbons and bows?
3551000	3553000	Yes, we are. We're going to sign, seal, and deliver it.
3553000	3556000	But this is fun. This is a good little chat. Those are really good questions, guys.
3556000	3557000	So, thank you.
3557000	3561000	It's nice to know that when we need to, we can pull a show out of our butt just by saying,
3561000	3563000	Hey guys, ask us questions.
3563000	3565000	And that's all the community right there.
3565000	3567000	You know what this means?
3567000	3575000	To sort of tease a little bit an idea that I brought up to you on Sunday about a little one hour thing involving a room in my house.
3575000	3577000	That would make it entirely possible.
3577000	3582000	It would. There could be plenty of good, fun things in store for us in 2010. We'll see.
3582000	3584000	So, thanks to everybody for the questions.
3584000	3587000	If I somehow missed your questions, I'm sorry, we'll roll it over to another show.
3587000	3590000	Don't forget, you can always send us an email. Mailbag at OrangeLaunchRadio.com.
3590000	3596000	And thank you guys so much for tuning into our show tonight, even though we weren't live or downloading it, even though it was a little different tonight.
3596000	3598000	I hope you guys have a great week.
3598000	3603000	We'll be back to do our normal show one week from Sunday, which would be October.
3603000	3608000	We need to bring back our missing houseguest, the ferret.
3608000	3610000	Oh, the ferret.
3610000	3611000	To join the ranks of the-
3611000	3614000	Do you miss the ferret more than Loki? Is that what you're trying to say?
3614000	3618000	No. No. No. No. Yes. No.
3618000	3622000	October 11th, we'll be live again at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, on All Games Radio.
3622000	3624000	www.AllGames.com
3624000	3626000	Any final thoughts tonight, DarkSakura?
3626000	3629000	I'm hungry.
3629000	3632000	I haven't talked about food all day.
3632000	3635000	That's how you know it's in a typical episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
3635000	3642000	My final thought is, by the time you're hearing this, I will be on Space Mountain Ghost Galaxy. Heart.
3642000	3646000	So, that's it. We're done. We're out of here.
3646000	3650000	Oh, let's go to San Francisco so we can wait for the tsunami.
3650000	3653000	The tsunami is not hitting the West Coast, didn't you hear?
3653000	3659000	Alright. We're out. Bye, guys. See you next week. October 11th, we'll be back live.
