14175	15217	and I, October 25th, 2009.
15898	19404	A major new store burns computer games while you wait.
19524	26737	We have an interview about the upcoming charity event, Umlaut, and some crappy little podcast once an obscure Japanese title released in the U.S.
44443	52205	I heard any good jokes lately?
53145	55486	Hi, and welcome to another edition of Orange Lounge Radio.
57386	64808	That's a podcast dedicated to video games, video gaming, gamer lifestyle, and of course, kittens!
65408	69049	Cute, adorable, fluffy kittens!
71345	80830	My name is Rob Roberts, joining you for the next few hours, of course, as with me as always, say hello to the one and only Secretary of Catnip, DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.
82711	87614	And of course, the one and only Secretary of Defense, TechMasterLoki.
88695	89615	He cleans the cat box.
90416	90696	I do.
92577	93758	How are you guys doing tonight?
94818	95879	It's been an interesting week.
96979	97960	Been a very interesting week.
98442	99703	It's been a unique week.
99783	101784	It's been a very unique week here at Orange Lounge Radio.
101824	106466	I have to say in the seven and a half years we've been doing Orange Lounge Radio, I haven't quite seen anything like it.
107426	117071	Usually at Orange Lounge Radio we start off the show talking about our gaming weeks, but you know, in spite of things going on, we thought we might change that up a little bit and start off tonight with some news.
117651	122453	And we're going to head over to Joystick with a Q. Of course, we like them over at Joystick.
122473	124234	They run lots of fun little game stories.
124854	125715	They ran a story this week.
126095	128516	Fans campaigning for President Cat.
129836	136479	Against all odds, a completely random Japanese Wii game starring a cat blogger has become a hot topic among some fans.
137239	144642	Tsukiban Satchu Rena Wii stars a cat named Rena from a popular Japanese blog as the CEO of Cat Queen Inc.
145042	149864	You play as a cat going through the initiation into the company, performing various minigames to earn Rena's respect.
149884	150544	That's not really true.
151224	151545	Oh, really?
152185	153545	You don't play a cat.
153565	154206	You play a person.
154806	155326	Oh, really now?
157986	165588	The Orange Lounge Radio Podcast discovered the game, which they have dubbed President Cat.
166428	168629	I like that, that we just dubbed it that.
168909	169609	Hey, they like it.
169869	171769	I shall call it President Cat.
172650	173410	Hey, they like it.
173610	173890	They did.
174530	176911	Then began tweeting the Wii game's official account.
177875	190485	The fans started sending messages of encouragement and support to the President Cat hashtag, and the Rena account has started responding in both Japanese and English, revealing that the publisher is excited and a little confused about all this sudden attention.
191245	197170	It would be hilarious if this grassroots movement resulted in the localization of a weird licensed game.
197890	201673	However, it would also be pretty sad if the publisher turned out to lose money on it.
202173	206597	It's definitely something we want to play, but we're not exactly representative of the mainstream audience.
210289	213190	That story coming from JC Fletcher over at Joystick.
213230	214650	I want to dodge flying cats.
216611	221972	Obviously, we're a little surprised, probably like most people, that this actually made game blogs this week.
222832	224833	A number of them.
225573	229014	Some people might think it was like a grab for attention, but no, please.
229074	232335	We've done far worse desperate cries for attention on this show in the past.
232375	232955	This was nothing.
233375	235096	What's also interesting about this is that...
236786	237406	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
259075	259976	GoNintendo and Destructoid
286673	292015	Obviously saw something in it, I think, that wasn't in some of the games we've talked about in the past.
292595	293616	And so it's very interesting.
293876	296317	It just goes to show the moral of the story.
297037	298698	America... Loves cats.
298838	299418	Loves cats.
300699	305861	And when I say America, I mean collectively the world that listens to this show.
305901	312804	We just happen to be in America, but our friends in Australia, Canada, Mexico, Europe, they all fucking love cats too.
313763	334035	and I think it just goes to show that people would like to see a game like this not everybody wants to see a game like this of course you look at the comments on this and you know the other sites that ran the article and there's people saying this game looks stupid yeah they probably also like Madden well yeah and my point would be there are some people that look at games like Madden and go well that's stupid
334315	334776	Like me.
334976	336658	I go a lot stupid to Madden.
336798	338340	I don't think Madden is stupid.
339121	340242	It's not my kind of game.
340262	341283	I think it's a waste of my time.
341423	344547	But I bet there are people out there that would say Uncharted 2 is stupid.
345008	349473	This game that gets critical praise, lavish, left and right upon it.
349513	350474	Somebody thinks it's stupid.
350914	352877	I don't, but somebody out there probably does.
353337	354338	I will say it's stupid.
354858	355739	You haven't even played it.
356059	356499	No, I haven't.
356520	357780	You just want to be controversial.
358101	358381	I know.
358421	361403	See, that's that desperate cry for attention people talk about.
361643	362724	It is not.
362984	364545	I am unique, just like everyone else.
365166	366567	So here's the thing, though.
367287	377015	The point behind this, and if you go back on the show weeks and weeks, years and years, months and months, whatever, we've talked about this for a long time.
377055	378796	It has to do with risk-taking.
380669	382170	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
404725	424509	and so they didn't really take a big risk I mean sure they I guess took a little risk in putting the game out over here which paid off for them with DDR yeah you know Beatmania not so much but a lot of Japanese companies I think are afraid to take risks sometimes because they think Americans don't get it or we're not gonna get it
425632	428113	Well, let this past week be a lesson.
428673	431694	There's a lot of people over here that get it.
432474	435135	Or else this story would have... Nobody would have cared.
435435	439476	Just like the past other hundred games we've talked about on this show that should be over here.
439856	441957	I'm thinking about doing a Shermie blog as tribute.
444077	444557	So, I don't know.
444617	446358	Loki, what are your thoughts on this whole thing?
446378	448278	You actually got the game this week, right?
448418	448778	Yes, I did.
449319	450119	And what did you think?
450499	451719	Is it worth all our hype?
452359	454200	Did this get out of hand, what?
455277	457079	How much of it is spoken?
478919	479619	There's a lot of it.
479819	483820	Well, it's not really spoken, it's just kind of in text boxes.
484540	488181	But, you know, it's fun.
489441	491281	Definitely would pick it up if it came out over here.
491561	500723	And, you know, as I posted in Twitter and stuff, there's been a few other cat games that have come out over here, more like the cat raising systems like, you know, Nintendogs kind of crap.
501783	505964	You know, Imagine Cats, and they also have like Purr Pals and stuff like that.
506104	508044	And you have to understand, even though
509820	512181	A lot of people don't get these kind of games on the Wii.
513222	515824	The Wii has so many units out there, it doesn't matter.
515844	521127	It takes such a small percentage of the people out there to sell a lot of units of this.
521167	522628	For example, those other cat games.
523229	525630	200,000 units and 400,000 units.
526091	527051	And they were shit.
527512	528993	They were absolute shit.
529333	532375	But people will buy anything that comes out on the Wii.
532795	535237	And if you put President Cat on the front of that box...
536081	536381	DarkSakura.com
555911	559472	What is the fear of putting a game like this out in the US?
576997	577957	I mean, there's plenty.
578017	581378	We read off Japanese releases every week, and many of them don't come over here.
582278	584579	Do they just think we don't get it?
585019	586959	It's just not the kind of game that would do well here?
587279	588319	What is the fear?
588539	597541	I think that it's just a lot of money that goes into localizing the game, and if they don't feel that they're going to sell enough units, then they're just not going to bother with it.
597901	605383	But then I look at companies like Atlus or even Axis Game Localization or even Ignition, whatever.
606012	609226	A lot of their games that come out over here that they decided to put out on the Wii...
610228	612710	or even like the DS and stuff don't sell that many units.
612930	618594	I mean, Atlus especially, they don't sell a lot of units, maybe 200,000 on a good title.
619454	621636	And, you know, they only have a limited run.
621676	623137	They've really cut their budget that way.
623697	632283	But I think that something like this, given the right marketing behind it, and I'm sure there would be, you know, a lot of praise for it, I think it would do pretty well.
632643	638667	And when you consider like these games like Pets, Cats 2 and Purr Pals, they have no marketing.
638847	640068	They have zero marketing.
640768	641709	Thanks for watching!
660799	665360	Let's go to the chat room, our always present other guests here on the program, chat.orangehauntsradio.com.
665380	669301	DarkTetsuya in chat asks, yeah, who would we contact about localizing this, if anyone?
669321	675682	And this kind of, you know, leading into the next question, what happens from here with our little mission to get this game localized?
675762	676783	I have a thought, but go ahead.
677383	682644	I would contact kind of the usual bunch of people that are out there playing.
683348	684689	Localizing Weird-Ass Games
708226	714269	But I guess they're picking these properties cheap enough or something that they decide, you know, that it's worth putting it out.
714309	720291	Like they put out, I forget if it was like Go Minion or something like that.
720311	723113	It ended up coming out as Domino Rally over here or something like that.
723133	725113	It's like Go Go Minion, I think was the name of it.
725133	729595	You know, that's a really obscure title, but they went ahead and brought it over here.
729716	731756	Axis Game Localization does the same stuff.
732237	734338	They've been doing a little bit more mainstream stuff lately.
734378	737019	They've been doing the Guilty Gear series, a lot of stuff from that.
737938	739439	But there's a few other things that they bring over.
739859	746601	Then if you want to talk to other publishers, there's Zoo Games that brings out a lot of, like, kind of bargain bin stuff.
746641	750683	They do a lot of localization for UK games that get released over there.
750703	760547	But they're willing to bring over properties that no one has any idea what the hell they are over here, like Kokuto, which is some sort of demon character that's popular, I guess, in the UK or something.
760987	764568	So should our listeners that feel passionate about the game email these guys, tweet them?
764648	766349	No, I think it'd be a good idea to maybe...
767503	791446	I would bring it up to maybe, I would go with like UFO Interactive and maybe Triaxis, maybe even like D3 or something, because remember D3, they brought over Defense Force, which is sweet and weird, Onishambara, plus they have the Simple Series in Japan, so they're used to weird ass games, but it's just, I don't know, it couldn't hurt to hit up more people than less.
792571	793652	Thanks for watching!
812034	812795	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
829754	841008	If you don't think game developers have already noticed when several major, major gaming blogs picked up the story... Yeah, and really what it comes down to is what kind of units are they looking to sell?
841108	843051	What would make it worthwhile for them to bring it over here?
843091	845474	I mean, obviously something like this is not going to sell a million units.
845594	848377	I mean, it's not going to be... I don't think it's going to be the next Katamari.
848597	848998	It's not...
849830	850330	They didn't need it.
850350	852092	Katamari was going to be the next Katamari.
852292	853673	Actually, it's good you bring that up.
853853	856415	Keep in mind, Katamari Damacy was a big risk, too.
856695	859537	That game was released for $20 several years ago.
859577	863079	And it was weird, and everyone loved it because it was different.
864200	873446	I want to read this comment, and I don't know if you have anything else you want to say on this, DarkSakura, but another comment from chat, Bochikawa in chat, Sky, the best jokes are those that we all can relate to.
874087	876208	And I think you hit the nail on the head there.
876388	876749	Again,
877952	878613	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
897083	899164	and it's part the Twitter thing.
899504	900745	I think that speaks volumes about Twitter.
901105	902026	It's part the Twitter thing.
902346	906268	But I think it's part the fact that people looked at this and went, oh my God, this does look really cute.
908249	922776	Why isn't there like a lolcats game with this as big as, you know, and maybe that wasn't the point behind this game, but that's what a lot of us are kind of interpreting it as, is cats in funny situations, cat wearing cat masks and the whole like stealing money game I saw a video of with the cats and the cat driving the car.
923036	926338	It is ridiculous and preposterous like lolcats and fun.
927438	927819	Fun.
928721	929042	Fun.
929062	933734	I think that the best kind of fun is the ones you don't expect to be fun.
934075	934937	The ones that surprise you.
935572	936272	Thanks for watching!
961224	963405	I gotta read this comment from Actdeft in our chatroom.
963505	965267	And who says that Twitter is useless?
965767	966848	I did two weeks ago.
967348	974093	I was actually listening to the show before last week's show, and I had said I was done and fed up with Twitter and I didn't get the point.
974553	975694	Boy, did I get told.
976774	977355	What did I get shown?
977375	977975	What is our purpose?
995379	996940	Whatever we determined it is at the time.
997821	1005405	No, I think our purpose was to show that more Japanese developers should think about bringing their quirky little games over here because there's an audience for it.
1005666	1008067	Shoot, where was it that we would always go to at E3?
1008107	1013250	We would go to the small little developers, to the ones that were looking... Kensha frickin' Hall.
1013851	1019634	Or the back corner where Natsume had their little walk around thinking you could get... Look, my sheep is right over there.
1019694	1020955	My Harvest Moon sheep.
1021796	1022036	You know...
1024077	1037003	Also, I was thinking, Matt made some good suggestions, but I think also look for that company, see if they've released any other games that have been released in the U.S.
1037043	1038964	and see who their marketer was.
1040585	1046728	But certainly, though, after the antics of last week, you know in a boardroom somewhere in Japan this got brought up.
1047367	1048408	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1069076	1069857	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1080956	1085699	So that was pretty much... So maybe developers, when you localize this, a little less Bing?
1086580	1088221	How about a cute meow noise instead of a Bing?
1088261	1092624	Something I actually noticed from the screenshots is that it's actually in very simple Japanese.
1094165	1100810	But part of the reason I was wondering is how much of it was actually spoken dialogue is because it would be much easier to follow if it's spoken.
1100830	1101911	There wasn't really any spoken.
1101991	1104173	It was a lot of meows and lots of text boxes.
1104977	1106659	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1123434	1125435	I will render services.
1125595	1127435	Any other thoughts on President Cat for now?
1127755	1129476	I don't know if there's anything left to say.
1129776	1132376	In a way, I kind of think our mission was successful.
1132496	1134557	I don't know if there's a lot else that can be done.
1135077	1139038	Ultimately, it's out of our hands at this point, and it is who's going to take a risk.
1139158	1140358	We can keep the awareness up.
1140638	1144319	I think we can keep the awareness up, and we can alert the potential risk takers.
1144499	1145579	Keep that hashtag going.
1145860	1146940	Yeah, keep the hashtag going.
1147280	1151241	Tweet the companies that you think ought to bring it over, and who knows what may happen.
1152356	1162861	Especially those of you that felt the need to email, because I know this came from tips from listeners, these various game blogs around the story.
1163621	1169104	Now that we've got that, I guess, start emailing some of the developers and see what happens.
1169324	1171045	I mean, the worst that happens, they're going to delete it.
1171733	1175395	Actually, I got their email address, the people over there.
1176435	1199067	I've just been trying to get a hold of one of my friends in Japan to translate it for me, and she's been less than forthcoming because she has, a mutual friend is over there visiting, so I might see if, any of our Japanese listeners who's really good with your translation, let me know, because I wanted to let them know exactly how we came across them, so shoot an email at the mailbag.
1199787	1200047	All right.
1200567	1202028	And we'll work together.
1202648	1206770	There may be some lucrative opportunity for you.
1207391	1207651	All right.
1208151	1210712	Well, let's get back into our regular show here.
1210752	1218296	Obviously, we've taken a 20-minute detour to talk about President Cap, but that kind of thing happens when we tend to get spotlighted for a week for whatever reason.
1218316	1220437	We're going to move into our regular show now.
1220637	1222578	Our ego swell and we turn into big divas.
1223078	1223578	Basically.
1224679	1225399	Hey, wait a minute.
1225419	1225759	What is this?
1225819	1226880	I asked for a Diet Coke.
1227762	1232488	DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
1245706	1247047	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1265979	1267821	DarkSakura, how have you had your gaming week?
1267841	1268082	Peggle!
1287975	1289356	Lots and lots of Peggle.
1290016	1294258	My goal in Peggle has been to beat some of the levels on the first try.
1294638	1298260	And I beat that freaking hard DNA level on the first try, and I was very proud of myself.
1299241	1301202	Like, one of the last ones with the spirals going up.
1301422	1301622	Anyway.
1302342	1313608	I have also really not been playing much of anything else, just simply because I had my midterms last week, and migraines all last week, and just...
1314828	1318492	The Son of Crap All Week Loki, how was your gaming week?
1334741	1335502	It was pretty good.
1335662	1338603	I actually played, well, like I mentioned earlier, President Cat.
1338903	1341684	So I played a little bit of the new Rena game.
1342425	1343965	And it was fun.
1344465	1351228	I got through... It starts off, it kind of breaks it up, like there's three mini-games you have to do, and then three more after that.
1351749	1357011	And I got past the first three mini-games, which is tough, because the last one was some question-answer thing.
1358345	1362667	I can't read any of that, so I just kept hitting random buttons, and yet somehow I was getting it correct.
1363227	1364508	So I managed to get past that.
1364548	1372451	I played the piano portion, which, even though I was hitting it in time, I guess I wasn't doing it well enough, and so they're getting pissed off.
1373211	1385136	And, of course, the car driving, which is weird, because you're controlling the cat in the back of the car that's sucking up what look like stars or clouds or something.
1385156	1386196	It's just weird.
1386897	1386997	Um...
1388072	1406362	and then also play the cat dodging which was kind of fun but yeah the game is weird and fun so definitely worth checking out the other thing of course I played tons of was DJ Hero just knocked out most of the songs in the game I think I've actually played through everything now
1409116	1409937	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1428076	1432858	and then finally of course Grand Theft Auto 4 played some more Lost and Damned.
1433278	1452326	Also found a way around their patch to get rid of the mods but I haven't really done much with that because it's not working correct because apparently if you've ever modded the Grand Theft Auto on PC if you change too much it becomes unstable and then each save file actually saves some of the
1454113	1454954	Stuff that you change.
1454994	1460798	So if I try to change certain weapons or whatever, they'll kind of disappear from the save, and it's a pain in the ass.
1461378	1468263	So I found a way around all that, but unfortunately the modded disc I made was very unstable, so I have to go back to the drawing board.
1468623	1481412	I don't really care, though, because a new expansion's coming out at the end of next week, so I may just hold off on modding everything until I can maybe get my hands on the Episodes of Liberty City disc instead, because that might be a little more fun.
1482273	1487414	We were even just playing the new expansion because that's just going to be all sorts of awesome.
1488674	1495336	Other than that, I moved the arcade cabinet into the house this afternoon, so hopefully going to be done with that soon.
1495356	1501497	I'm downloading some front-end stuff for this program called Hyper Spin.
1501537	1503377	I'm going to be running on it.
1503557	1507698	I've been downloading themes for a bunch of different games that I have in MAME.
1507718	1509079	That's it.
1512523	1519388	I've been playing mostly World of Warcraft this week because, you know, I'm sucked into WoWcrack, but I did try out one new game.
1520109	1530277	I say game in quotes because it wasn't really a game, but I checked out a game on PlayStation Network this week called Dot Detuned, or just Detuned, I guess you could call the game.
1530637	1533459	And it was something I think that was brought up at the very end of our show last week.
1533479	1535301	I want to say one of the callers alerted us to it or
1535921	1541323	I don't know if I saw it on Twitter during the week, but I saw it was $3, and I was like, wow, what a deal for a game.
1541383	1546426	So I went ahead and downloaded it and checked it out, and yeah, it wasn't quite what I was expecting.
1546486	1554469	Because I heard that you could use custom soundtracks in the game, and I finally figured out why my songs weren't copying over on my USB card to the PS3.
1554589	1559151	I had to go in there and do all or whatever, hit the triangle button, and was finally able to figure it out.
1559691	1560191	I love music games.
1560211	1560812	That's what I'm all about.
1560832	1561612	So let's check out this game.
1561632	1562172	Not exactly.
1577239	1578299	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1600129	1600850	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1616127	1617408	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1646249	1647530	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1667909	1670871	You sit there and you press the buttons and it kind of does different things.
1671312	1674614	I imagine it's a lot more impactful if you're on drugs or something.
1675154	1677556	I'm not on drugs, so I didn't quite see that.
1677956	1681258	But yeah, it was just interesting.
1681859	1687202	I'm not saying it was bad because it was $3 and it's certainly something different.
1687242	1690284	I'm just saying it's not a game, so be careful.
1690344	1693386	And yet it awards trophies even though it's not a game.
1693666	1696989	And I will tell you this, if you want the easiest trophies,
1697629	1700750	Like, easier than those achievements in the Avatar game on 360.
1702171	1708033	Just pay the three bucks for this game and you can have like a gold trophy, like three silvers and a handful of bronze in like seconds.
1709073	1715416	I didn't even look at what the trophies were and I had all but one of them unlocked in five minutes in the game.
1715456	1716956	It was incredibly simple.
1717737	1725079	But that's, of course, I wouldn't recommend downloading a game just for trophies, but I know there's some people out there that are, you know, EPing whores and want to see that stuff.
1725820	1726380	Otherwise,
1727745	1735688	This is kind of one of those things, like, I don't know if you ever go to, like, the Museum of Modern Art, and you see some things in there that are really, really cool, like Andy Warhol paintings, you're like, oh, that's kind of neat.
1735708	1737429	You know, that Marilyn Monroe painting's kind of rad.
1737949	1745112	But then, like, you see that other piece on the wall that just looks like someone threw a paint can against the canvas and called it art.
1745372	1745932	That's art!
1746592	1751094	Well, this is, okay, well, this is what that game, this is the art equivalent of...
1752253	1754375	This is the video game equivalent of that art piece.
1754835	1759538	You kind of look at it and go, okay, I guess there's art in here somewhere.
1762240	1767303	But you know what, it does add to the very interesting debate that is, are video games art or not?
1767963	1769945	It's very, very strange.
1770405	1770925	So there you go.
1772386	1774007	And I'm going to link this in the chat room.
1774408	1775028	But look at this.
1775929	1776469	Isn't that art?
1776769	1777830	I've seen that before.
1778871	1780672	But it's not what one would conventionally...
1781963	1783244	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1803052	1803532	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1824011	1824271	All right.
1844557	1847338	Yeah, so that's not the most bizarre thing ever.
1847838	1850479	Going to the chat room, Alpha Cananogram is in caps.
1850659	1851599	It's not a game.
1852060	1852880	I believe I said that.
1853080	1853860	It's not a game.
1854340	1857962	But keep in mind, they're selling it in the game section of the PlayStation Store.
1858062	1860042	So just, you know, be forewarned.
1860102	1861623	It is not a game.
1861663	1864024	And it awards trophies like a game would do.
1865504	1868665	You know, games usually have objectives and there are objectives with the trophy.
1868685	1869405	But it's not a game.
1869445	1870006	I'm just saying.
1870446	1871006	It's not a game.
1872847	1873327	DarkSakura.com
1898610	1901472	at www.twitter.com slash OLR.
1902072	1904874	And also on tonight's show, we actually have a pretty full show tonight.
1905134	1909076	We're going to be interviewing later on in the show, in part B, our pal Seg.
1909497	1914780	He is putting on a big part of this Oom Loud event that's going on in San Francisco.
1914820	1916521	It's a charity event for Child's Play.
1917121	1922304	And we think these kinds of things that are very creative and involve video games and, you know, raise money for good causes.
1922645	1925827	Things that give gamers a good name as opposed to, you know,
1926587	1930309	Kid shoots up neighbors, says he was inspired by Grand Theft Auto.
1930669	1935211	We love covering things like this that really offset the crap stuff that's in the media.
1935251	1936311	So this is a great cause.
1936692	1938813	We hope our friends in the Bay Area will show up to this.
1938853	1941154	We're going to talk to Seg a little later in the show, talk about Umlaut.
1941474	1942234	I know I'm going.
1942594	1944395	I think Jamie's going to go because I'll give her a ride.
1944415	1945536	She said all she needed was a ride.
1945876	1947196	Loki will try to get to go.
1947717	1950338	If all of us can go, we could have a band.
1951857	1953640	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1961607	1963729	Anyhow, we'll get into that a little later on in Part B of our show.
1964089	1965690	But first, some gaming news.
1965910	1966971	Start us off tonight, Loki.
1967451	1972294	Yes, recently Microsoft opened their first Microsoft store in Scottsdale, Arizona.
1973015	1985824	And of course, one of the big things about the store, other than kind of being sort of a copy of an Apple store, is that they have the ability to basically print their own Windows games.
1986544	1989607	And the way this is done is you actually order it from a kiosk.
1990527	2007872	and then give your name to one of the representatives in the stores and then basically wait a few minutes and you'll actually have the game with the label on the game printed, the case and inserts as well as the manual all printed for you.
2008532	2009733	So it's kind of like that whole...
2012165	2019610	I don't know, they have a kiosk out there that will print, or I guess will make custom DVDs for you as well, like movies.
2020091	2034120	But this is kind of cool, actually, because you can't really knock it since games, like for PC at least, there's not really a used market for them, at least not one that you would see in a GameStop or something like that.
2034701	2038263	So if you're looking for a case and stuff, and...
2039224	2041005	They don't have to have inventory in the store.
2041045	2045248	I mean, that's pretty awesome.
2045528	2049431	I'd be kind of curious to see if they could do something like this with Xbox Live Arcade games or something.
2049451	2050172	That'd be pretty cool.
2051602	2052103	Red Boss Kiosks
2071445	2072065	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2088911	2089372	Thanks for watching!
2104674	2126901	I guess I get the idea of putting out-of-print or catalog games into this kind of system, but as far as new games go, isn't the whole reason to walk into a store and buy a video game as opposed to just going onto Steam or Direct to Drive or one of those companies online, isn't the whole point of having the box, having the manual and that kind of new game smell that comes when you open up the box?
2127141	2128021	They still get that.
2128041	2129782	I mean, they get the manual and everything printed.
2130002	2133383	It's just they won't get the big, giant cardboard box that goes with it.
2134303	2135745	Which I guess saves trees.
2135865	2136625	I don't know.
2137006	2138327	I guess you could look at it that way.
2138527	2141989	It's neat, I guess.
2143010	2148655	You get a disc and you don't have to worry about it being out of stock because they're just burning the game for you.
2148735	2149876	So, why not?
2150703	2151223	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2168737	2174260	But I guess this might be cool for like parents going Christmas shopping, wanting to buy computer games for the kids.
2174600	2180143	You know, you could see what the game looks like on a monitor in front of you, kind of see if it's appropriate for kids or not.
2180463	2188167	Like if it's, you know, Lego that you're getting or if it's, you know, Demon Slayers from hell with boobies or whatever that, you know, you don't want to get the kids.
2188187	2193029	You can kind of see what it is in the kiosk before you actually buy it and then have it printed right there.
2193269	2195711	I guess that would be the target audience for this kind of thing.
2196271	2196671	I think so.
2196731	2197231	Question mark.
2197672	2197852	Yeah.
2198312	2198432	So.
2201238	2208743	and some comments from our chatroom at chat.orangeloungeradio.com GameGuru says, besides, you can buy DVD cases and print out box art.
2209184	2209804	Yeah, but I don't know.
2209844	2210484	It's not the same.
2211085	2213246	The homemade stuff just isn't the same to me.
2213366	2218570	It's not the same and they actually, obviously, since it's games for Windows stuff, they have this stuff licensed.
2218590	2222192	They have the actual manufacturers giving them the artwork for this.
2222252	2229937	They have probably the process to I'm sure it's not just going to be like an inkjet printer printing out a piece of crappy artwork that's going to be on
2230137	2233619	Paper that looks like cheap crap that you would make at home.
2234079	2237221	But I think this is going to be a little bit better than that.
2238041	2240383	And I don't know.
2241083	2241823	I'd be interested to see.
2241863	2243404	There's a lot of people that reported on this.
2243904	2246966	And obviously a lot of people that visited the store.
2247426	2251709	So how is the software that's burned off that?
2251729	2252389	Does it look good?
2252449	2254710	Does it look cheap and knocked off?
2255411	2257552	Is it something that you could probably do at home for a lot less?
2257572	2257772	Yeah.
2259543	2260704	Everything Working Designs Did
2280034	2282577	I would like to see them in their store
2295414	2297596	I would like to see this in other stores.
2298417	2308686	I know you can buy Microsoft Points and stuff like that and go purchase your own Xbox Live Arcade games, but I want actual cards for each individual game.
2309207	2321398	Or something that I can print out and say, I want to give the gift of, and why I would never punish someone like this, give someone the gift of the Warriors game that they put out on Xbox Live Arcade.
2321892	2322773	and so on and so forth.
2345635	2351920	So, okay, Jamie brought in an epic manual that came to her mind, and it's for Sega Ages on the Sega Saturn, and it's fancy.
2351960	2355843	It's got, like, raised print and, like, the foil writing for Sega Ages.
2356363	2357424	It was a working designs game.
2358045	2358645	It's pretty epic.
2359886	2360367	There you go.
2360967	2367312	So, I know, could we make cards for Yaris and get those printed, and I can give those to, like, it's like giving someone a fruitcake for Christmas?
2368013	2368873	Yeah, it's free.
2369414	2370274	That would be kind of funny.
2370595	2373997	But even, like, you know, not necessarily that, but, like, custom...
2374838	2375278	and DarkSakura.com.
2398874	2399174	I don't know.
2399434	2400034	It's kind of cool.
2422241	2425883	and, by the way, this is coming out here in the U.S.
2426183	2427724	This is being localized.
2429184	2430705	By whom is it being localized?
2431746	2433426	Some brave, brave soul.
2434847	2438789	To be honest, I think Axe AK Sis is the name of the company.
2438809	2440009	Axe is game localization.
2440170	2443031	The company I was talking about that localizes obscure shit.
2443171	2445272	Hello, this would be a perfect candidate.
2445712	2446853	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2465129	2488190	Joe Aniki Zero being localized for the US as if there's an audience for this because a lot of people look at this and go LOL WTF because yes if you don't already know it's all about like muscle bound guys wearing thong and all this muscle man-tastic voyage I believe that press reliefs even said about it I mean this is a ludicrous freaking game
2490586	2492807	And the SNES one came out in Virtual Console?
2513379	2534515	but there's an audience for this so I just can't it's funny to me that there's an audience for this yet President Cat you know doesn't apparently have an audience over here and it's going to end up in bargain bins across America so it's just interesting so yeah as Loki said there's your perfect candidate company for someone to bring the kitty cat games over with we'll see
2535407	2540331	Well, how about something that is no surprise to anybody?
2540752	2542373	What's that?
2542773	2547317	Microsoft has poo-pooed on any thoughts of having Blu-ray on Xbox 360.
2548879	2549879	Which we sort of knew.
2552003	2558530	They were talking about, Microsoft was actually talking about Blu-ray accessories for the PC, but not for the Xbox 360.
2558570	2563415	Yeah, I think some interview some dude did with some website earlier this week.
2563656	2564557	And that's so professional.
2564597	2565758	Some dude at some website.
2565898	2570323	It's pretty much the boss, Steve Ballmer, said, uh-uh.
2570603	2576005	But a lot of people interpreted him to say that these Blu-ray... Oh, Blu-ray for Xbox 360 imminent.
2576485	2578165	I saw that all over Twitter that night.
2578585	2579666	Blu-ray's coming to Xbox 360.
2579706	2583047	That was me rolling my eyes and going, no.
2583327	2583547	Yeah.
2584147	2586348	Why would Microsoft put out a Sony product?
2586388	2588388	Especially... And you know, they kind of make a good point.
2588728	2593850	And it's funny enough because, yet again, here's something we just talked about two weeks ago on the show or even last week.
2594290	2597591	I think before all that cat madness started, we were talking about how...
2598691	2601952	One thing that Sony has that Microsoft doesn't have is Blu-ray.
2602372	2607354	And if Microsoft was smart, they would be selling the streaming video, the Netflix.
2607394	2617917	And sure enough, when they kind of backpedaled on what the dude had said earlier in the week, they said, hey, we're going to be the only system with streaming 1080p very soon.
2619318	2622519	So they're kind of saying you don't need Blu-ray when you have streaming video.
2623739	2623939	Yeah.
2625410	2625730	I don't know.
2626891	2628631	I like the Netflix Instant Queue stuff.
2630492	2635194	I like Netflix Instant Queue, but at the same time, I'm very proud this week of one of my purchases.
2635674	2639375	I bought the box collection of the Star Trek Next Generation movies.
2639756	2640196	That's right.
2640376	2642737	All four movies with Captain Picard and a bonus disc.
2642797	2643497	I'm very excited.
2643937	2644417	On Blu-ray.
2644437	2645738	And that's not something I would have wanted to download.
2645758	2646818	So you're bringing that over, right?
2647439	2648679	We could totally have a nerd-a-thon.
2648779	2649639	I am all over.
2649659	2651080	I actually haven't seen Insurrection.
2652298	2652598	What?
2653239	2654621	And I've got it on Laserdisc, I think.
2654741	2655322	Oh my gosh.
2655362	2658928	We should totally have a Blu-ray next Genathon with booze.
2659008	2660651	I have first contact on Laserdisc.
2660791	2661392	Can we drink?
2662053	2662253	Sure.
2662634	2662974	Awesome.
2663035	2664076	We're going to have a nerdy slumber party.
2664116	2664817	I like Booze Mahal.
2664958	2665619	It would be awesome.
2666812	2668653	Anyhow, I don't know how we got off topic.
2668873	2673794	But for me, it's kind of the same thing going back to the story we were talking about earlier with the games being printed on demand.
2674454	2677355	I would not have downloaded the Star Trek collection.
2678075	2689098	And even though I could probably get a lot of these on Instant Netflix, it's just not the same as having the collection in your house anytime you want, put in the disc.
2689518	2692259	Yeah, but it's easier for me to watch stuff on my computer.
2693159	2695180	Is it just me or are Blu-rays seeming to get a little cheaper?
2695620	2696960	They're getting a little cheaper, not much.
2697861	2699341	You're finding used ones more often.
2699541	2701522	And I'm finding a lot of sales now.
2701602	2703042	I'm seeing a lot of Blu-rays.
2703082	2704163	I was at Best Buy this week.
2704903	2708364	One game I didn't talk about during my gaming week because we've talked about it at length the past couple weeks.
2708404	2709865	I finally played the DJ Hero demo.
2710825	2712086	I was at Best Buy, and I was looking at Blu-rays.
2712106	2713286	They had a lot of Blu-rays available for $10, $15.
2713366	2714687	So, you know, they're starting to come the way of DVDs.
2714707	2716547	They're still a little more expensive than DVDs.
2716587	2719109	You can get DVDs for $4 at Walmart, but they're coming down a little bit, which is nice.
2733254	2736579	All right, let's move on with some more gaming news.
2736619	2740644	We'll get to release dates very soon and see if there's anything wacky coming out this week.
2741085	2742206	But first, some more news.
2742747	2748215	Yeah, I don't know about another President Cat, but I'm all campaigned out.
2749068	2758132	Yeah, so Xbox Live, the preview for the new fall update, they have sent out their first Wave 1 invites.
2758592	2762013	In fact, actually, I got one of those, so I have the new update.
2762794	2766915	I haven't gotten a chance to play with a lot of the stuff on there, but I did do the Twitter thing.
2767316	2772438	And the problem I see is I don't think I'm going to use half this stuff.
2772678	2775459	I mean, the Twitter and the Facebook stuff, it's neat.
2777313	2781376	Do you know how many tweets I saw this week that were, Hey, I'm posted from my 360!
2781836	2783817	I'm just like, eye roll.
2784198	2786139	Like, we totally saw this coming.
2786399	2788260	Everybody's going to have to do that mandatory tweet.
2788540	2791042	Hey guys, I got in the preview program.
2791082	2791722	Here's my tweet from 360.
2791782	2794024	Hey, I want to tell you guys a secret.
2795416	2798219	Almost everybody who signs up for these preview programs gets in.
2798259	2798759	You know why?
2799319	2801541	Because it's Microsoft's little way now.
2801862	2807366	Do you remember when their system crashed a couple years ago when they rolled out one of these updates because everybody was freaking downloading it at once?
2807707	2811910	This little preview program is their way of doing a rolling release for these updates.
2812691	2814012	Except they're going to have to re-download it.
2814052	2815053	It's not the full thing.
2815213	2815714	Oh, really?
2816034	2816214	Yeah.
2816354	2816654	Huh.
2817235	2817575	Interesting.
2817855	2820458	Because the music store isn't working yet.
2820738	2822159	Well, they have Lips on there and that's it.
2822660	2822840	Yeah.
2823717	2827700	But yeah, so apparently a lot of people got in on it.
2827960	2829921	And they did have a lot of cool stuff in there.
2829941	2833344	Of course, if you're in the UK, you got to check out the Sky Player and that kind of thing.
2833874	2841976	You know, over here in North America, you know, they had, of course, the Last.fm, you know, Facebook.
2841996	2843477	Did you check out the Last.fm by chance?
2843497	2843797	No, I haven't.
2843817	2847278	That's the one thing I am kind of curious about because I am a Last.fm user.
2847658	2850379	I prefer it to Pandora and the other services available out there.
2850759	2854980	I think they're great because the way it kind of syncs up with your iPod and everything with the Scrabbler.
2856160	2858461	And the recommendations have been, for the most part, pretty good.
2858901	2860802	So I'm really curious to see what the Last.fm...
2862199	2864540	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2890865	2894508	DJ DarkKnight and GoldAnthro both saying you can't play them with your games.
2894528	2895830	Last.fm does not work with your game.
2895850	2896150	That's lame.
2912844	2914065	Synthpop and Spice Girls Mixed Together Epic
2940322	2940862	Very epic.
2942103	2945406	And Tiger Claw also confirms that the music stops playing when you exit out of it.
2945446	2949048	So it sounds like it's kind of like an independent application, kind of like Netflix is, basically.
2949388	2950749	Like, the movies stop when you leave Netflix.
2950769	2952510	Like, all the programs are kind of like that, too.
2952570	2959595	Like, you know, the Twitter and stuff, it kind of goes into its own program thing, and then you actually back out to the main menu when you're done.
2960716	2961156	Whatever.
2961236	2965880	I mean, if I really am that desperate to check Twitter and stuff, I guess that would be handy.
2966200	2967341	It might be useful, like, if I...
2968484	2969565	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2995322	2997226	That is a very good question.
2997406	3002376	That is one thing that Xbox is sorely lacking, and these are the people that make Internet Explorer.
3004480	3004780	Why?
3005240	3016084	Is there not... Unless, you know, because Internet Explorer is, you know, kind of a magnet for bugs and all sorts of exploits and whatnot, that they're worried that somehow they're going to find a way around it.
3016104	3021687	Oh, people playing, like, emulated games, like Nintendo games in a Flash browser or something, you know?
3022247	3023247	Is that what they're worried about, maybe?
3023367	3023707	Maybe.
3024408	3028789	But I would think that with maybe Facebook or something, you might be able to kind of exploit something, too.
3028909	3032691	You know, I never even thought to do that on the PlayStation, because the PlayStation has a decent web browser.
3033391	3038753	But is it just me, or are both the PlayStation and the Wii, their web browsers, just kind of clunky?
3039093	3041393	Like, they just don't work like it does on a computer.
3041673	3047635	And, I don't know, especially when I'm using the YouTube TV site, they're so slow to load.
3047695	3052137	That's been the hang-up of any type of web system on a console.
3053157	3053717	I mean, really.
3053837	3054237	You think?
3054417	3056898	I mean, but isn't the PS3 supposed to be a computer?
3058038	3058618	So they said.
3058658	3060519	I think they did it just for the tax cut, remember?
3061095	3061435	I guess.
3062356	3065057	They seem a little clunky to me.
3065357	3068398	You guys have been to my house.
3068418	3072260	When I have a lot of people over, we'll fire up YouTube and watch funny things.
3072460	3075641	It's really good to be able to do it on the Wii or the PlayStation 3.
3075781	3078102	I love that new YouTube channel, but it's slow and clunky.
3078783	3079403	You know what I say?
3079423	3083625	If you want to run anything off the internet on your TV, build a multimedia box.
3085154	3091637	I guess, but... Especially now with an HDTV, it's so cheap and easy to do.
3092778	3098080	DJ Dark Knight does say in chat, I do like how on Last.fm they do have video game music stations.
3098140	3098921	I wasn't aware of that.
3099121	3099921	That's kind of interesting.
3100702	3101722	So I'm going to have to check this out.
3101982	3105024	You know I'm going on like 60 days since I've played an Xbox 360.
3105524	3107485	I'm like, I've been all PlayStation 3 lately.
3108005	3109306	So, very interesting.
3110206	3116032	Anyhow, speaking of PlayStation 3, I signed into Home and there were like six requests to join our club, so I approved them all.
3116072	3123819	So if you want to join the Sony Home Club for Orange Lounge Radio, look for us on the search and add us before we fill up.
3125888	3126088	Fable 3
3155888	3157529	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3181670	3182974	I mean, this is starting to get a little cheap.
3183094	3183515	You know what I mean?
3183535	3184859	That's getting silly.
3184899	3185441	I'm sorry.
3185541	3187005	Here's my problem with it.
3187146	3189252	It's Fable 3, and I'm sorry.
3190444	3191325	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3217113	3218974	I'm just going to bypass the whole game altogether.
3219635	3222637	Unless there's something that's really awesome that I must play in this.
3223258	3227901	I mean, I guess it's where we're going to be going with it.
3228682	3233025	It's the trend that's showing up that I'm getting really nervous about.
3233065	3235127	But the bottom line is, if you don't like it, don't buy it.
3235427	3236788	Show them that you're not going to support it.
3236868	3238549	That's really what it boils down to in the end.
3238910	3241292	But it's just kind of sad that it's going there in the first place.
3241352	3242412	I'm still going to buy Fable 3.
3242533	3245295	I loved Fable 2 and the first Fable was good too.
3245355	3246876	No matter what, I'm going to buy it.
3249538	3252200	I'll just get my upgrades naturally.
3275256	3275656	Yeah, I agree.
3275676	3276396	Yeah, you did.
3276416	3276637	Yeah.
3303686	3305328	It totally sucks when something like that happens.
3305529	3307191	So I totally agree with their stance.
3307511	3317786	If you buy gold online, you suck because you're supporting this practice of hacking accounts like mine and supporting keyloggers and funding this, basically.
3317906	3319789	So don't buy gold online.
3321266	3325490	One other thing I wanted to state, although Matt kind of stated it, it was circulated also this week.
3325970	3328192	Project Natal will be supported in Fable 3.
3328312	3337621	That, of course, should come as no surprise at all since Peter Molyneux was, of course, out there at E3 this year kind of promoting Project Natal.
3337641	3339122	But there will be support for it in Fable 3.
3340223	3341224	What will it do?
3341244	3342485	I don't know.
3342905	3346488	Wait till the game comes out.
3346668	3347269	That's what it does.
3347769	3348130	I don't know.
3349380	3352182	Well, you know, there's something else going on that's, I think, a little stinky.
3352743	3354664	Very much like the weapon upgrade business.
3357006	3362030	There's a game that's called Parachute Panic that's on iPhone and iPod Touch.
3362831	3366454	And I'm allergic to it.
3367809	3368709	Actually, there's dust in the room.
3369630	3376832	But now, on the last version that came out, you can pay 99 cents to unlock another five lives.
3376892	3378093	And it's a 99 cent game already.
3378753	3388036	So, I mean, you can just do it in-game, but for the impatient people who want more lives, then you just pay for it.
3388197	3389077	I think it's kind of stupid.
3390920	3391260	No, I agree.
3391280	3393701	I think it's really just encouraging gamer laziness really.
3420009	3422051	It's kind of like EA and their cheat codes, remember?
3422211	3423992	Stuff that normally would be in a game for free.
3424052	3425994	But hey, now we can sell it for two bucks.
3429934	3437297	I don't have as much of a problem with it if it's something that you can achieve in the game otherwise, especially single player.
3437578	3441660	Keep in mind when I ranted about WoW, that's a multiplayer experience and much different.
3441980	3451845	But a single player game, you know what, if you want to use cheats to your heart's content in a single player game where you're not interacting with other people going online or what have you, go for it.
3452065	3455247	And if you want to pay two bucks because you're too lazy to get it yourself, fine.
3456107	3460671	But as long as the option is there for you to still get it yourself and work towards it, I think it's okay.
3461132	3462773	It's just not something I would probably do.
3463914	3467637	I think it's more fun if you... I think anything worth having is worth working for.
3468838	3470320	Even if it's in a game or not.
3471767	3483414	I am behind on some chatroom comments, so I want to read some comments from our chatroom, chat.orangeloungeradio.com Salacious Pop says, it could just be rose-colored glasses, but Dreamcast's browser was pretty good.
3484014	3485115	Kind of going back a ways back.
3485135	3485955	Yeah, it was decent.
3485975	3486536	For the time.
3486756	3486956	Yeah.
3487076	3493640	You know, you have to kind of say, okay, well, you know, that was 1999, this is before kind of web browsers were standard like that.
3493960	3496402	What did Dreamcast's browser have to compete with, WebTV?
3496422	3496502	Yeah.
3497703	3500505	So yeah, I think for its time, it was certainly pretty good.
3501526	3506051	Let's see, Redertainment says the store in Fable 3 will be good, but the store in Fable 4 will be awesome.
3507301	3510924	Let's hope that it's not more of this nickel and diming stuff, but I'm sure it will be.
3511985	3513306	Also a question from Red Entertainment.
3513386	3516388	If Natal gets delayed, will Fable 3 get delayed?
3516708	3521492	And Seg replies with his thought, maybe not unless Microsoft wants it as a launch product.
3521552	3525515	I assume Fable 3 is an add-on support for Natal rather than a requirement.
3526056	3527297	So I guess, yeah, that's a good thought.
3527337	3530079	It depends on how much Natal is integrated into this game.
3530459	3535023	If it's like a required part of the game, then yeah, Natal delay is going to affect the game, but
3535623	3540987	If it's just kind of a, hey, a bonus little game or a bonus little quest, then maybe not.
3541327	3545691	I could see that kind of being the case, is that there's a download expansion that uses Natal or something like that.
3546011	3547972	It would be kind of interesting, I suppose.
3551215	3554477	Well, moving right along into some release dates.
3554657	3556919	Loki, take us through the US releases this week.
3557247	3557587	DJ Hero
3572847	3580711	Also coming out this week, we've got Tekken 6 on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, as well as the Fight Sick bundles for those.
3582052	3588155	Hasbro Family Game Night 2 on the DS and on the Wii.

3591876	3598039	SpongeBob's Truth or Square on DS, Xbox 360, and the Wii.
3598079	3598960	We've also got...
3601496	3604617	Probably not for many of our listeners, but ni hao, Kylan.
3605137	3608719	Super game day on the Wii for your Nick Jr.
3608739	3608979	fans.
3609219	3612960	You read a lot of game releases that I don't think a single one of OLR listeners care about.
3612980	3616342	Hey, they may have kids that watch Nick Jr., and that is important.
3616402	3616882	Just saying.
3617182	3617642	Just saying.
3618502	3620523	Also, The Backyard Again is another Nick Jr.
3620623	3620863	program.
3623760	3626621	Nerf N-Strike Elite with the scope.
3627101	3628701	It's going to be coming out in a bundle for the Wii.
3629961	3632402	Borderlands on PC, also making its way out this week.
3633082	3638943	RE Smarter Than a Fifth Grader Game Time on the Wii and DS and Xbox 360.
3640343	3642764	Pets, Dolphins, Encounters on the DS.
3643284	3648845	Once again, another game series that puts out tons of games, and I'm sure they don't sell very well, but hey, you know what?
3648885	3650785	They're putting them out, and people pick them up.
3652448	3672322	Barbie and the Three Musketeers on DS and Wii Monster 4x4 Stunt Racer with a pack-in wheel coming to the Wii Drawn to Life the next chapter also on Wii and DS this time Diner Dash Flow on the Go still the best title for the DS title wow
3675069	3676972	Ben 10, Alien Force, Vilgax Attacks on PS2, Wii, DS, PSP
3692759	3717445	Forza Motorsports 3 on Xbox 360 CSI Deadly Intent on DS and Wii I think PS3 and Xbox 360 as well this one's for Rob Press Your Luck 2010 coming out on PC, Wii, and I believe DS as well but if it's not Peter Tamarkin then I don't give a crap and I don't see how that'll be possible because he's kind of dead
3720005	3721186	What's his name?
3721226	3721807	Todd Newton?
3722207	3723068	Can't stand him.
3723088	3724669	He's like the worst game show host ever.
3724689	3725329	Reanimation.
3725409	3725990	Ruined whammy.
3726610	3731674	And going back to the roots of this show, Dance Dance Revolution Hot Party 3 making its way out from Konami.
3732015	3735557	Of course, all these games now kind of blend together because they all kind of suck.
3737078	3743904	I believe also to kind of go with that, DDRX2 will be coming out as well in the bundle on PlayStation 2.
3744384	3748287	They only sell these games in a bundle now because they want you to buy those crappy dance pads to go with them.
3750401	3759127	and Hamster's Bunch on PSP because God forbid if the PSP be devoid of crappy pet games.
3760788	3762389	And Dream Salon on DS.
3763369	3764210	That's going to be crap.
3765751	3767712	And finally, stuff coming out a week from now.
3772046	3773366	Rabbids Go Home would be the last.
3773486	3775447	Oh, Ratchet and Clank, Crack in Time.
3775587	3777708	That's another title that will be coming out this week as well.
3778168	3780149	I've got to read some comments from chat if you're done.
3780529	3780809	I'm done.
3781109	3784910	DarkTituya says, Sky, three words, Zombie Peter Tamarkin.
3785511	3785831	Awesome.
3787332	3788413	Let's see, what else was said here?
3788493	3791095	Oh, SalaciousPop says, I'd play a Nick Jr.
3791396	3792937	Eureka's Castle FPS.
3793658	3794819	Hell yeah!
3794839	3796180	That would be kind of cool.
3796220	3799163	Exactly, where are the Nickelodeon games for me?
3800024	3801025	Screw the children!
3801325	3803107	I want my Nickelodeon games.
3803187	3807471	Like, for instance, can I get like a You Can't Do That on Television minigame collection?
3808071	3817298	or like, Hey Dude, Explore the Ranch Game, or Salute Your Shorts, you know, so Are You Afraid of the Dark?
3817418	3824803	The best episode of Salute Your Shorts had to have been, was it, the Water Balloon Capture the Flag episode, my favorite.
3826064	3828345	Thank You, Seg, Legends of the Hidden Temple.
3829566	3829946	Guts.
3830106	3832047	Actually, they did have a Guts game on Super Nintendo, didn't they?
3832067	3832767	Nick Arcade.
3832787	3833307	Yeah, I know.
3833587	3840389	How about reviving one of these old, like, classic frickin'... For all I care, do a fuckin' today's special video game.
3840509	3841089	I don't care.
3841189	3843129	Just give me something I remember from my childhood.
3843149	3843529	David the Gnome?
3844369	3845550	Dude, David the Gnome was great.
3845590	3846690	Turkey Television.
3848890	3851351	Tell me you wouldn't play a Turkey Television, like, shooting game.
3851371	3852171	It'd be amazing.
3852591	3853812	Well, they do have Chicken Shoot.
3853832	3854572	That's kinda close.
3854712	3855152	I guess so.
3856960	3859182	Alright, let's go to Japanese release dates.
3859242	3861884	Is there anything that's going to make us go crazy this week?
3862425	3867449	Probably not, because Japan's getting a lot of the titles that are big and expected for us over here this week.
3867489	3869891	And Japanese releases this week on the Xbox 360.
3870051	3877718	Bayonetta makes its way to the Xbox 360 on October 29th, as well as Tekken 6, of course, is a big deal over there, just as it is over here.
3878098	3885024	Those both coming out to the Xbox 360, and of course, just in time for Tekken 6, another Hori arcade stick with the Tekken 6 design on it.
3885484	3887965	If you'd care to import one of those from Japan.
3888225	3889626	Or you can just get them here in the bundle.
3890166	3890406	Fine.
3890826	3893407	Or on the PlayStation 3, you could get Bayonetta there.
3893667	3895328	Or the, again, Tekken 6.
3895648	3897428	There's also a game getting a price reduction.
3897448	3901110	That's Samurai Do 3 Plus getting a price reduction this week.
3901150	3903170	So those are the big releases on the 360 PS3 combo.
3905251	3908134	Dipping into Nintendo Wii, we have some different alternate titles.
3908474	3909676	Another Dragon Ball title.
3910316	3911517	I'm sorry, that's a US date.
3911998	3914080	Chin Sports makes its way to Japan.
3914580	3917663	This is kind of a minigame collection that's wacky and weird sports.
3918324	3920346	This is the one that has the extreme ironing.
3920706	3924309	I think this came up on the show a few weeks ago.
3924369	3925530	It came out last month.
3925730	3927031	Yeah, for here in the US.
3927131	3929453	The Japanese are getting their own version of that.
3930154	3932856	Probably what people care a little more about would be Sin and Punishment 2.
3932976	3935338	That is finally being released on Nintendo Wii this week.
3936179	3941764	Super Robot Taisen Neo comes out as well because there just wasn't enough Super Robot Taisen games.
3942304	3943826	Hikari no 4 Senshi Final Fantasy Gaiden Side Story
3966027	3976336	Yeah, and it's that same style of like Final Fantasy 3 DS and the Final Fantasy 12 spin-off game, but don't expect it to play like your other Final Fantasy games.
3976536	3977537	It's a little bit different.
3979238	3982181	You know what I miss as far as Final Fantasy spin-off games go?
3982261	3985804	You know what my favorite, like seriously my favorite Final Fantasy spin-off game was?
3986104	3987045	Tease Me All You Want.
3987345	3988746	I fucking love Chocobo Racing.
3988766	3990087	That game is amazing.
3990127	3991889	No, I know a lot of people who love that one.
3991969	3993250	I wish they would make another one.
3993270	3994111	I love that game.
3995063	3996004	That was perfect for the Wii.
3997325	4002909	Or give me my extreme chocobo racing on the PlayStation 3 just in time for Final Fantasy XIII.
4003029	4006772	You know, you reminded me, I forgot two major titles and I don't understand how I did that.
4007072	4009894	Fairytale Fights was coming out on Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3.
4010474	4011795	Dude, how did I forget this?
4011835	4015398	Grand Theft Auto Episodes of Liberty City on Xbox 360 this week.
4015438	4015798	Fail.
4015998	4017940	Because I think most people think of that as a download title.
4018761	4019721	It's still going to be awesome.
4019961	4020322	It's true.
4021192	4022313	Fairytale Fighters.
4022393	4023455	Is that what it sounds like?
4023475	4024336	No, Fairytale Fights.
4024636	4029181	Think of it as like Castle Crashers but with fairytale characters.
4029321	4030142	It's brutal.
4030583	4032085	It's like blood and guts everywhere.
4032105	4033687	Oh, you talked about this on a previous show.
4033747	4034968	This sounded awesome.
4034988	4036410	I'm going to have to check that out.
4036710	4038272	Is it cheap or is it like 60 bucks?
4038752	4039133	I think it's like 50.
4040755	4045058	I'll wait for the bargain bin, because that's... You want to talk about a game that'll end up in the bargain bin?
4045558	4045898	Let's see.
4046319	4050582	We can't really sell this game to children, and adults probably won't take it very seriously either.
4051743	4055446	We could market this to the people that bought the Red Riding Hood zombie game on the DS.
4056407	4058508	That's probably the target market for this.
4058888	4060209	It's got to be the same company, right?
4061010	4061250	Nope.
4061350	4061571	Right?
4062671	4063392	That was Zoo Games.
4063952	4064153	It did...
4066418	4069280	Red Riding Hood Zombie BBQ Yeah, that was it.
4069320	4070900	That was an awesome game.
4070960	4072441	I played it at PAX, I think.
4072461	4073561	It was either PAX or E3.
4074962	4078343	I think it was PAX.
4079184	4084686	And SalaciousPop reminded me in chat there saying I only got maybe 7-8 hours in the Tactics titles.
4084766	4088447	I suppose Final Fantasy Tactics is a pretty notable spin-off of the Final Fantasy series.
4088928	4089668	But you know what's sad?
4090188	4094070	I probably spent more time playing Chocobo Racing than the Final Fantasy Tactics games.
4095421	4115948	that's for sure quickly I wanted to mention on the PSP just because I think this name is hilarious it's R-Type Tactics 2 yes the R-Type Tactical game remember that is actually getting a sequel and the sequel is called Operation Bitter Chocolate I can't make that up that is the real name of the game Operation Bitter Chocolate so would that be Dark Chocolate?
4116308	4117148	Baker's Chocolate?
4117248	4124731	I don't know that's what it's called Operation Semi-Sweet Chocolate with a little bit of nuts Operation I don't get it
4125902	4133668	Grand Theft Auto IV, The Ballad of Gay Tony, Aggressed Generations of War, Borderlands, DJ Hero, Fallout 3 Game of the Year Edition, Football Manager 2010, Tekken 6, Feel, Wii Fit Plus, and Yoga for Wii.
4150549	4160552	All right, we're going to get to the classic game of the week very, very soon here, but just two more stories for you guys real quick, and then the break, and then our interview with our pal Seg about Umlaut right after the break tonight.
4161033	4168415	You know, since we were talking a little bit about fairytale fights, they did have an achievement at one point for killing children in this.
4168955	4175737	So not to be outdone, of course, Dante's Inferno, the game full of great ideas and awesome promotions.
4177438	4183504	is now getting some flack for an achievement called Bad Nanny.
4184485	4187748	And this achievement is... You've been a very bad nanny.
4187829	4189270	I can just see Super Nanny.
4189530	4192753	This achievement is... You need to go and sit on the naughty step.
4193494	4194595	You've been very naughty.
4194956	4199200	Apparently this achievement is for killing unbaptized babies in the game.
4199994	4200635	Thank you for watching!
4218323	4219904	Do they not have a sense of humor?
4220184	4225727	I mean, this isn't saying that, like, you know, bad International Nanny Association or something like that.
4225847	4231590	My mom was a nanny, actually, for many, many years, and I can verify they do not have a sense of humor.
4232811	4235192	Actually, my mom's hilarious, but I don't think she'd find that funny.
4235652	4236372	Your mom's a hoot.
4236913	4240054	It's a video game about hell.
4240174	4242956	I mean, they've got walls made out of writhing naked people.
4242996	4246998	I mean, this isn't exactly... This isn't saying you should go kill babies.
4248103	4249004	Just demon babies.
4249725	4251146	Are you saying we should go kill babies?
4251506	4252727	Demon babies, okay?
4253588	4255610	I mean, look at Silent Hill with the smoke babies.
4255790	4258533	I mean, yes, you need to kill them because they're not human.
4259754	4260855	They're trying to eat you.
4262016	4262537	Or something.
4262857	4263678	Cats aren't human.
4263698	4264338	Do you kill them?
4265279	4266620	No, I don't kill them.
4266861	4268402	But they're not demon babies either.
4269964	4272006	Well, sometimes they are, but most of the time they're not.
4272958	4285465	a comment from xlink in chat chat.orange.radio.com they say no to this but you can shoot kids in Fallout 3 hmm those kids had it coming shut up
4286792	4291876	All right, speaking of things I told you were coming before too long on a completely different note.
4292257	4295339	Remember when I said don't discount Facebook gaming?
4295359	4296160	Uh-oh.
4296340	4296981	Don't discount.
4297001	4299243	There is a big, big new game coming to Facebook.
4299703	4302505	Civilization Network has been announced for Facebook.
4302525	4306429	And in my opinion, this is huge because this is what it sounds like.
4306469	4311293	It is a major PC beloved franchise colliding with the world of Facebook games.
4311593	4315254	and some of you are preparing your block application thing on Facebook right now.
4315294	4317095	Which, by the way, tangent warning.
4317895	4319715	What the hell is up with those changes on Facebook?
4320996	4321776	What changes?
4322136	4329298	Okay, now they've changed it so when you log in you get like a news feed that seems to be like a random sampling of the stuff that you would see before.
4329618	4331018	Like the popular stories.
4331598	4333739	If you want to see the live feed you have to click into that.
4333799	4340661	But now the live feed shows not just people's updates but like who became friends with who and all this stuff that you really don't want to see.
4341454	4342455	All the stuff we don't care about.
4343036	4344417	Yay, more stuff we get to block.
4345118	4345799	You can't block it.
4345939	4348422	Because if you block it, then you block the person that did the friending.
4349403	4352886	So yeah, Facebook didn't think that one through very well.
4353346	4354887	Anyhow, sorry, I digress.
4355428	4359110	Civilization Network is making its way to Facebook and it's supposed to be out sometime in 2010.
4359811	4362613	There's actually a Facebook page already set up.
4363393	4367436	It's on facebook.com slash civnetwork, C-I-V network.
4367997	4371079	And they're going to be on the lookout for beta testers very soon.
4371640	4375903	Sid Meier himself has said that the game will offer everything that people love about Civ...
4376443	4379226	in a quote, fully persistent environment.
4379627	4382790	Best of all, the game will be free.
4384172	4384712	I like free.
4384993	4394183	Brian Reynolds, who is behind Civilization 2 and Alpha Centauri, has the job of chief designer at the social gaming developer site Zynga.
4394223	4395825	It's kind of an interesting little coincidence.
4395865	4397246	He has nothing to do with this game, but...
4398669	4412958	it's interesting that he did so much with that now he's at this other company so you think maybe old friends maybe got together at dinner talking about this who knows but Facebook gaming dude it's common this is going to be something we're going to see in the next few months just get bigger and bigger
4414860	4418442	Alright, now we're going to get into a section of the show that we like to get into every week.
4418502	4424087	It's a section for DarkSakura to open up the gaming vault and take a travel through gaming's past.
4424107	4427409	It's a segment we call the Classic Game of the Week.
4427850	4430572	DarkSakura, what video game do you think the kids should be playing this week?
4432043	4434484	For those in the U.S., it is Galactic Attack.
4436624	4438125	It has been known by many other names.
4441285	4448107	In Japan, in the arcade, it was called Rayforce, but because of licensing, it came out as Layer Section on the Saturn.
4448567	4451908	We got it as Galactic Attack, and in Europe, they got it as Gunlock.
4452468	4457909	But it is in the Ray series, Rayforce, Raystorm, and Raycrisis.
4459530	4461391	And it's pretty freaking amazing shooting game.
4463493	4475423	I love the way that it plays because not only do you have the stuff coming from you from right above, you also target below your ship and can launch missiles at targets in the background.
4476384	4478005	Or as it should be, toward the bottom.
4478666	4480207	Can I add something to that?
4480868	4481048	No.
4481868	4484571	Unless you want to hear some of the lovely little shooting sound effects here.
4484711	4485151	Sure, why not?
4485231	4485712	The music's good.
4491209	4492431	Definitely sounds like a shooting game.
4492451	4493974	Just bullets, bullets, and more bullets.
4495092	4495892	It really is.
4496072	4502193	I mean, it is just one of the, you know, regular old, you know, shooting games.
4502833	4504634	But I think it's one of Taito's best.
4504754	4507334	I mean, especially, I love the entire series.
4507474	4512135	I mean, Raystorm and Ray Crisis were fantastic.
4512335	4515596	But this, to me, I think is what really gave it to us.
4516236	4522277	It's, to this day, one of my favorite shooters and one of the reasons to have a rotating widescreen monitor.
4524656	4524976	That's it.
4525597	4525897	All right.
4526598	4528659	So there it is, your classic game of the week.
4528939	4530481	It goes by several different names, right?
4530501	4531942	We have Galactic Attack in the U.S.
4532262	4532542	Uh-huh.
4532582	4533443	Gunlock in Europe.
4533743	4534364	Uh-huh.
4534544	4537286	Layer Section for the Japanese home version.
4537867	4540789	And in the arcade, it was Ray Force.
4540829	4541970	Why couldn't they just pick one name?
4542310	4543311	Because of licensing.
4545193	4546714	It was fully licensing.
4547452	4549274	Alright, well there you have it, your classic game of the week.
4549995	4551557	Many, many different names for that one.
4551997	4553739	Check it out on the Sega Saturn.
4554460	4555822	Jamie loves her Sega games.
4556082	4556623	Yes, she does.
4557785	4558205	I sure do.
4558425	4558685	Alright.
4559065	4562046	Well, that's going to do it for this Part A of our podcast, but don't go anywhere.
4562086	4566427	We're going to be right back with plenty more in Part B. We have a lot coming up on deck in Part B tonight.
4566467	4577910	Not only do we have some news, some quick little stories here about what's coming out on Rock Band and Xbox Live and some news on Star Trek Online and Beatles Rock Band and so forth, but we have an interview coming up.
4578490	4584212	Our pal Seg is the man behind a charity event coming up in the Bay Area very soon known as Umlaut.
4584872	4587695	And we're going to be talking to him about what's going to go down in December.
4587895	4589817	Just a few weeks away, if you can believe it.
4589837	4590678	The year's almost up.
4591018	4592300	But it's all for a great cause.
4592320	4594742	We're going to talk to Seg all about it right after this quick break.
4595083	4595763	So don't go anywhere.
4595784	4598667	We'll be right back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
4605021	4617470	And welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio here on this lovely Sunday evening, October the 25th of 2009, where we are taping the 342nd episode of our podcast, if you can believe it.
4617970	4629618	And of course you can tune in every week and listen to us tape live at www.allgamesradio.com, or if you just want the radio feed, it's allgamesradio.com, that's how I usually go in there.
4630038	4634382	or there's also a radio app that you can get on your iPhone if you just search for All Games in the Store.
4634442	4639165	They are the folks who we steal our bandwidth from every week and we really, really appreciate it.
4639646	4642308	So anyway, we're going to move into something a little different here.
4642328	4650434	We usually be doing Twitter topics about now, but we're actually going to invite a friend of the program on the show and he goes by Seg Online, but his name is John Segerson.
4650474	4657440	He actually goes by the nickname Seg and he is one of the minds behind Umlaut, which is a charity event that is happening in San Francisco at the DNA Lounge in
4657780	4661761	Wednesday, December 9th of this year, 7pm to 2am.
4661821	4665802	It is a rock band event for Child's Play Charity.
4665842	4669463	We like to talk about charity events and gamers doing good things.
4669523	4674644	So we're going to give Seg a call and get him on the show to talk to us a little bit about Umlaut.
4675444	4680425	So we're going to go ahead and ring him up on Skype right now and see what happens.
4681788	4682568	Orange Lounge Radio
4711457	4714979	It's an umlaut, but louder.
4716720	4725024	It's a charity event for Child's Play charity, which provides video games, toys, and other financial support to children's hospitals around the globe.
4725864	4735129	And our event is we play rock band as a catalyst for people donating money to Child's Play.
4736277	4741860	But now, is Rock Band the only thing that's going on at this event, or is this kind of like just a big party where Rock Band's kind of in the corner?
4742140	4742680	How's this work?
4743120	4751484	Well, actually, this is going to be a very different kind of Rock Band night than most Rock Band nights.
4751524	4760369	I mean, usually when people go out to do Rock Band at a bar or something, it's there, but it's just everyone playing to a projector and all that.
4761189	4764011	We're doing something a little bit more.
4765252	4771956	We'll have one area of just regular rock band play, no fuss or anything, in the upstairs lounge area.
4772477	4781383	But for the main event, you're playing rock band on the DNA Lounge stage, a San Francisco concert venue.
4781983	4787087	And you will be performing rock band as a band on a concert stage to an audience.
4787147	4788288	So it's more than just...
4789528	4792229	Just playing rock band to the projector and all that.
4792509	4797771	You are putting on a rock concert for people.
4798772	4810716	And depending on what kind of band package you donate to, you can really get the ultimate rock concert performance experience with the lighting, band introduction, the whole nine yards.
4811107	4824280	Tell us a little more about some of these different experiences that rock band wannabes, or however you want to phrase it, because you talk about how you can actually get up on a real stage that quote-unquote real bands have performed up on.
4824320	4828645	Is that something that's accessible to everybody, or what are the different options for my band to showcase at this event?
4829184	4843609	so first of all I do want to say that we do have two stages and one stage is free for anybody to show up and we'll get in a little later of what everybody can do but if you and three of your friends
4844669	4851053	really want to perform on the main stage, we have two packages to perform on the main stage.
4851113	4859378	There's a standard band package, which we're going to ask for a $40 donation, but if you order online, it's $35.
4860238	4861299	And that's the whole band.
4861459	4864721	So if you split that up to four people, that's $8.75 a person.
4867063	4869985	And for the standard band package, you get to play on the stage.
4870726	4875610	You just play on the stage regularly, but you're still playing to the crowd on a major San Francisco stage.
4876110	4881055	Now, if you want to rock harder, that's where our ultimate band package comes in.
4881155	4883377	If you want to put some extra oomph in your oomph loud.
4884017	4884758	Exactly.
4885638	4891904	And we're asking for $120 for the donation, but again, that's the band package, so it amounts to $30.
4891944	4892284	And you get...
4893385	4894905	Thanks for watching!
4914404	4917887	Every song on Rock Band available.
4918487	4927134	We actually partnered up with Harmonix with this and they will be providing stuff that can be played on Rock Band 2, but all of it.
4927194	4933399	So there's those few songs on Rock Band 1 that won't be included.
4934060	4939664	And Beatles doesn't count for the main stage because it's just hard to get people through without switching discs.
4939744	4941125	Yeah, you don't want to have to switch discs all the time.
4941445	4943606	Is it still like, what, a thousand songs to pick from?
4943626	4945507	Yeah, it's about a thousand songs.
4946067	4953370	So we feel we're comfortable in doing this because it'd be pretty lame to have the same song played again.
4954071	4957152	So if you're in the ultimate band package, you get to reserve it ahead of time.
4958613	4959593	So that's one thing.
4960654	4967557	You also get, each member of your band will get lanyards, that sort of VIP pass thing.
4968677	4997663	that's a nice little take home memento you also get you'll get a gift bag for each band member four bags and when you're about to go on stage you'll be introduced as your band you have to pick a name for your band and we'll make an introduction for you and we get the lighting guy involved and it just really makes it the kind of experience you really can't really can't get anywhere with it did you get the rock band Fog Machine?
4998303	4999705	Who needs the fog machine?
4999745	5005912	You'll have the full lighting setup of the DNA Lounge's concert venue stage.
5006112	5006833	I guess true enough.
5006873	5009055	You get industrial strength.
5009556	5011899	Yes, you get the industrial strength concert.
5012179	5013000	Fair enough, fair enough.
5013280	5025771	And for those folks that are thinking, oh my gosh, $120, that's a lot of money, keep in mind, this is, you know, A, a once-in-a-never type experience that you can get getting to play on the stage, and B, the fact that it's going to charity.
5025911	5029054	I mean, it's not like going in SAG's pocket, it's going to a great charity.
5029514	5031214	Yes, it's going to Child's Play.
5031795	5039737	We really want to stress that this is a donation, and the money that you give is going to Child's Play.
5043478	5052300	If you stood back and just saw it as the value of just like, what would I pay just to play rock band, you're kind of thinking it a little wrong in this context.
5052660	5057081	This is a donation to which we are thanking you by giving you this experience.
5057403	5058204	All ages show at DNA Lounge
5082162	5082742	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
5109477	5115023	We are asking for a $10 donation because this is a charity event.
5116084	5117365	But no one will be turned away.
5117845	5123411	And even if you don't do the donation, you will get two raffle tickets for our prize raffle.
5123972	5127235	And our prize raffle is stuff that we've been...
5129657	5144588	my cohorts Chris Kohler, Joe Marquette have been collecting throughout the year of all this swag and all this stuff and they've been piling up in their apartments and we're going to give this stuff away as prizes in this free raffle
5145629	5164797	so there's a lot of incentive there and actually Chris is doing a prize a day on our blog at umloud.org that's U-M-L-O-U-D dot org where he'll take a photo of some of the things that he'll have and post it so you can see the kinds of things that we'll be giving away on that night
5165734	5170496	Now, I know this is an event that's being hosted at the DNA Lounge, which is on 11th Street in San Francisco.
5170536	5172776	And again, the date and time, if you missed it, December 9th, 2009.
5173496	5175217	That's a Wednesday, 7 p.m.
5175297	5176097	till 2 a.m.
5176157	5177438	Like most bars are open till 2 a.m.
5178238	5181059	But what if we have listeners all over the globe, really?
5181159	5184640	How can people help out if they can't be there in San Francisco on that night?
5185945	5200292	Yes, I know our event is around San Francisco and all that, but if you can't make it to San Francisco or any of the other kinds of events that are happening, please consider a donation to Child's Play Charity.
5200872	5208096	Just go directly to them, they're childsplaycharity.org, and just consider a donation direct to them.
5208576	5215641	We're doing this thing here in San Francisco because of the success of Foombrowser last year, and a lot of people liked it.
5215701	5221606	And it's the kind of thing that we know that a lot of people come to, and we want to facilitate that.
5222046	5229832	But what we're really here is to create awareness to Child's Play Charity as a whole.
5230212	5237658	And this is one microchasm of the many things going on in the gaming community to help Child's Play Charity.
5238373	5240635	Well, I think it's a great cause and it's a really fun event.
5240735	5249201	And, you know, if nothing else, even if people are like shy, you know, one thing that should be said is that this isn't just, you know, for people that love attention of getting up on stage and all that.
5249241	5257707	If you just kind of want to come hang with, you know, cool people, come to this event because I'm going to be there and I believe DarkSakura is going to be there and we're trying to get Loki there.
5258008	5259068	So hopefully we'll all be there.
5259108	5259789	So come hang with us.
5260117	5261338	Yes, and we'll definitely have more.
5261398	5263519	There's stuff that we're working on.
5263579	5273546	I can't really say right now, but don't feel that just because you didn't get the band package thing that there's nothing for you.
5273886	5276108	There will be plenty of things for you to do.
5276148	5278369	You will have a good time just showing up.
5278469	5280711	So please, please come by.
5281471	5282492	We'd love to have you.
5283773	5287499	It's, again, for all the information of this, there are many, many other things.
5287879	5290623	Please come to our website, umloud.org.
5290723	5293327	That's U-M-L-O-U-D dot org.
5294148	5295090	And we hope to see you there.
5295743	5297084	And I just wanted to mention this real quick.
5297124	5303807	I'm kind of glancing through chat here and I see Tigerclaw in chat says something about DNA Lounge seems to have like a live video stream.
5304508	5305328	Oh, yes, that's right.
5305368	5310551	Yes, there will be a live video stream that will be turned on during our events.
5310651	5315774	So you can also see us rock out all the bands.
5316094	5320056	It's going to be centered on the main stage, I believe.
5320636	5324018	And you can view it from anywhere during the night as well.
5324517	5325978	DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft
5346044	5348625	Get on the boat soon to do the band packages.
5348906	5357090	We'll have a few of the standard on hand, but that's sort of our release valve to make sure that everyone who's paid for a package gets to play on the stage.
5357170	5362673	And we're also increasing the price a little more on the night of for the standard package.
5363114	5372319	So if you really want to do that, if you really want to do this, please order soon than later.
5373183	5373503	All right.
5373924	5379028	So once again, this is Umlaut happening Wednesday, December 9th of this year, 7 p.m.
5379048	5379708	to 2 a.m.
5379748	5382590	at the DNA Lounge on 11th Street in San Francisco.
5382991	5385913	More information is available on their website, umlaut.org.
5385953	5388395	That's U-M-L-O-U-D.org.
5388755	5391998	And you guys are on the Twitter and the Facebook and all those fun spots too, right?
5392458	5400942	Yes, it's amazing how many things can and cannot use the umlauted U. And that's so important for an event like this.
5400962	5401703	It's so important.
5401723	5402163	It is.
5402483	5405625	But don't worry, you don't have to figure out how to type it into your computer to get to the website.
5405665	5407245	Just a normal U will do just fine.
5407265	5408486	Yes, a normal U will work.
5408746	5409406	Alright, there you go.
5409746	5410907	Seg, thank you so much.
5411127	5412347	Best of luck with the event.
5412367	5413127	No, thank you guys.
5413548	5417569	We had to rebrand this event a week and a half ago.
5418869	5424851	So we really appreciate any word coming out of this event since it's a new name and everything.
5425532	5429533	And we will have a great event for you guys to come.
5430143	5430844	Alright, awesome.
5430864	5434126	And hey, yeah, listeners, definitely follow these guys on Facebook or Twitter.
5434206	5443933	Even if you're not in San Francisco, you might have a friend or relative or someone who likes video games that might see you following this and check it out.
5444033	5447476	Get the word out about Umlaut and a great event for Child's Play Charity.
5449117	5450358	Alright, Seg, thank you so much.
5450778	5451258	Thank you.
5451378	5451739	Take care.
5453305	5457068	We need to get mullet wigs I'm all for dressing up We need the rock mullet
5472341	5473862	Loki, come on, buddy.
5474682	5475202	Come on, buddy.
5475242	5476483	We'll see if I can make it down there.
5476543	5477243	All right, all right.
5477283	5481866	At least we got upgraded from I don't know to a we'll see, so that's usually good.
5482246	5482506	All right.
5482886	5485367	Anyhow, we'll get to more Skype calls a little later on in the show.
5485688	5488469	I want to thank our buddy, Seg, for tuning in live and being here with us live.
5488769	5496393	We've got plenty more show for you, including some rapid-fire news, and I believe right into a story about Rock Band and maybe some more songs you can play at this event.
5496513	5497134	Rob Zombie, Pac-1
5514955	5517877	Which I gotta say has got some sweet songs in it.
5518017	5519758	Definitely something I'm going to be purchasing.
5520419	5523200	Including Burn, Dragula, and Super Beast.
5523321	5525262	It's about frickin' time Dragula's in the game.
5525322	5526623	Hell yes.
5527823	5528844	What song are we going to sing?
5528924	5530505	That would be a perfect song.
5530525	5531366	You want to do Dragula?
5531806	5533727	I can get up on there and do my best Rob Zombie.
5534128	5536589	I'll have to get a big curly wig or something.
5536609	5537490	We'll figure something out.
5538972	5545636	Wolfmother Pack 1 New Moon Rising, Pilgrim, Sundial, White Unicorn, Woman Liz Fair, Rock Me, Morning Wood, Best of Me, Sugar Baby
5560939	5561880	and each of those are available.
5562200	5566942	Actually the Morning Wood tracks are half off so it's only a buck or 80 Microsoft points.
5567903	5572305	Everything else individually is $1.99 or 200 Wii points or 160 Microsoft points and of course the packs are a little bit cheaper.
5572325	5573766	The Rob Zombie pack is $5.49 or 440 Microsoft points.
5573786	5576267	$6.80 Microsoft points for the Wolf Mother pack or $8.49 in real money.
5587733	5589394	And then, of course, the PSP.
5590134	5594496	They're getting Sonic Youth, Cool Thing, and Steely Dan, My Old School.
5594836	5595436	Both of those for $2.
5597957	5610703	And then to go along with releases here, Konami has confirmed that they're going to be releasing a port of Shadow of Destiny, which came out, I believe, on PlayStation 2 not too long ago.
5611483	5612123	And, yeah.
5613804	5613964	Yeah.
5614341	5617222	I remember it being a pretty decent game when it came out on PlayStation 2.
5634997	5639179	Alright, well speaking of release dates, it's not very often we're talking about a game coming out early.
5639239	5642301	In fact, this year it's been talking about all these games getting delayed to 2010.
5642941	5649344	But Need for Speed Nitro, that's the new Need for Speed entry on the Nintendo Wii and DS, has had its release bumped up.
5649745	5652126	It was originally going to come out November 17th, but guess what?
5652206	5656668	It's now coming out November 3rd here in the US and November 6th over in Europe.
5656748	5658709	So it actually got out a little early.
5659089	5660550	I actually checked this out at E3.
5660670	5662071	Pretty cool for a Wii game.
5662471	5664192	I know that sounds kind of harsh, but
5664392	5664993	Thanks for watching!
5680565	5685068	On Xbox Live, Rainbow Islands Towering Adventure is coming out on Xbox Live.
5685388	5690172	Yes, that would be Rainbow Islands, that game that kind of was once inspired by Bubble Bobble.
5690232	5692013	It was kind of like a sequel to Bubble Bobble.
5692393	5693054	It was a little different.
5693094	5695255	It was still Bub and Bob, but they were shooting rainbows.
5695555	5698317	Although I noticed in the screenshots for this game, I don't see Bub and Bob.
5698357	5699438	It's like a new little guy here.
5699498	5701079	So this is some new little spin-off game.
5701559	5703180	It's Rainbow Islands Towering Adventure.
5703200	5706443	It is actually a port of a WiiWare game that came out a little while ago.
5707283	5710005	So it's coming out very, very soon.
5711445	5720993	Also for those who are in Europe and can make it and are interested, there's going to be playable Star Trek Online at Eurogamer Expo.
5722034	5727037	They're almost out of tickets too, but that's on Wednesday the 28th in Leeds.
5727898	5729179	And yeah, they're almost sold out.
5729339	5735984	But you can actually play on one of the gaming PCs there and...
5738681	5741162	It's different level demos.
5741282	5743883	You can do ship-to-ship and planet combat.
5744244	5747805	And you can shoot Klingons in space.
5748706	5752067	You can actually, I think, play as Klingons in that one, too.
5752968	5756889	And also, you can go visit the giant lopsided donut.
5757050	5758090	I mean, the Guardian of Forever.
5758930	5759951	So, it should be fun.
5764233	5764413	And...
5766121	5766721	Bayonetta.
5767621	5769562	Bayonetta has done something major.
5770102	5773803	It is the first Xbox 360 game that got a perfect score from Famitsu.
5774603	5775983	It got a perfect 40-40.
5776923	5778724	Although now Bayonetta is cross-platform.
5778764	5781604	It just happens that Xbox 360 is one of the platforms it's on, correct?
5781624	5782565	And also the better version.
5783385	5784725	Yeah, the other one got 38.
5785645	5787186	Oh, so they did review both.
5787386	5788006	Yeah.
5788206	5789626	I didn't know that Famitsu did that.
5789706	5790246	Very interesting.
5790446	5792627	Well, there are... If you actually...
5793907	5796868	Look for movies on YouTube of them side by side.
5797728	5799429	You will see a noticeable difference.
5799469	5799869	Interesting.
5800229	5805931	Now, Famitsu Magazine doesn't hand out 40s very often, although it seems like we've had a few of these stories in the past few years.
5806491	5809132	Sometimes you kind of raise an eyebrow at the games they give 40s to.
5809252	5811753	I believe Nintendogs was one of their 40 titles.
5812093	5816655	But there's a lot of really, really great games in the past, like Final Fantasy XII and so forth, that got this as well.
5816695	5817735	So it definitely is a distinction.
5817755	5820156	I think only, what, a dozen games in the history of the magazine have had it?
5820376	5820816	I think so.
5820836	5821797	For me, it's really tough.
5821957	5825819	So Bayonetta, getting that is a big like, whoa, whoa, hello.
5826019	5827240	Well, I'm totally getting Bayonetta.
5827380	5829321	Any word on what it was they loved about the game?
5830162	5832203	Or just we're only hearing about the 40s right now?
5832743	5834945	I think it's just the 40s so far.
5835025	5836085	Let me double check.
5837366	5842129	Salacious Pop clarifies, by the way, they gave the PS3 version a 38 because the port is muddy and bad.
5842469	5844730	It looks brown and is missing quite a bit of particles.
5845031	5845191	Ouch.
5846073	5851296	Yeah, they're not really saying why, but yeah, just seriously, look at them side by side.
5852197	5852937	38's still not bad.
5853058	5854058	That's intense.
5854298	5855679	It's like, oh, it's crappy.
5855839	5860242	I think President Cat got, what, like a 24 from Famitsu.
5860282	5860902	That's harsh.
5860922	5863504	Yeah, they're used to seeing these games a lot, too.
5863564	5865706	I think it's a lot different for them than it was for us.
5865726	5867987	Maybe like a generic party game coming out over here on the Wii.
5868007	5872570	I mean, those are a dime a dozen, whereas Cat games, there's two.
5873795	5874675	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
5900362	5911031	No word on what the hell this is going to be used for, possibly a design for their new remote, their motion controller device, sans ice cream, I guess.
5911732	5916796	But it sort of looks like a sex toy, too, so I don't know.
5920119	5920920	That sounds kind of gross.
5920940	5921961	Yeah.
5921981	5922181	Yeah.
5926205	5929486	So this is not like these are actually coming out.
5929566	5932446	This is just a list of this is what could have been or what is this?
5933227	5934007	It's a design.
5934267	5935027	They may go with it.
5935067	5936007	They may not go with it.
5936027	5939468	It's just like Nintendo with their inflatable chair of fun.
5940249	5940949	It might come out.
5941009	5941469	It might not.
5941529	5942309	It's just an idea.
5942389	5947891	I thought everything was sold on the whole lights thing or the changing light dot beam looking thing.
5948351	5949711	Now, I thought that's what we were going at.
5949911	5952692	Well, maybe they decided to change...
5953325	5953866	The way they look.
5953946	5957951	Maybe there's a light on here that we don't see or something.
5958011	5958352	I don't know.
5958892	5962117	To me, it looks like a plastic cylinder that has four buttons on top.
5964340	5965101	Well, you know what, though?
5965221	5965421	I don't...
5967308	5972229	I have a lot of faith in Sony when it comes to controller design because I still love the PlayStation controllers.
5972549	5976750	Although then again, I say that and then at the same time I think, yeah, but then they did take DualShock out of the PS3.
5976970	5978070	But that was a whole different reason.
5978090	5979050	That wasn't really a design thing.
5979070	5980930	That was because they didn't want to pay royalties.
5981230	5994953	But, you know, the PlayStation 3 controller is still a rock solid controller, especially, you know, and I took some crap last week for saying this, but especially compared to the 360 controller, which, you know, the D-pad leaves a lot to be desired on the 360 controller.
5994973	5996493	The PS3 is a pretty slick controller.
5997153	5998013	Especially the newer ones.
5998333	6001534	So, you know, I kind of trust their judgment when it comes to making controllers.
6001574	6005175	They usually don't make bad ones, except that boomerang thing was really weird.
6005675	6006935	But that never did come out.
6006955	6008116	That was only a concept thing.
6008196	6011577	So, maybe that light thing went the way of the boomerang.
6011597	6021059	Thankfully, we do live in the day and the age of the internet, because if this was like, you know, the mid-90s where all we had were gaming magazines, that boomerang would have come out.
6021699	6022179	Possibly.
6022199	6024660	Because they wouldn't have heard the horrible feedback.
6024720	6025300	I don't think...
6026559	6026939	I don't know.
6026979	6029100	This is like a debate that's years old at this point.
6029140	6031520	But I don't know if the boomerang was necessarily a bad thing.
6031560	6032960	I'd have to feel it in my hands.
6033380	6036821	If it felt fine to control with, I would have been okay with the weird design.
6037741	6042222	But I just think at the same time, the PlayStation controllers are one of the best controllers ever.
6042662	6044343	Why ruin a good thing?
6044403	6046403	Look at the PS1, PS2, PS3 controllers.
6046663	6049604	They've all been pretty much the same, and there's a reason for that.
6049644	6052785	Granted, they added Rumble to it at some point along the way.
6052825	6054205	They added DualShock and all that.
6055933	6057228	Pretty much though it stayed consistent.
6060631	6063413	Moving on to another news story having to do with Beatles Rock Band.
6063613	6068396	Beatles Rock Band has actually beaten Guitar Hero 5 on the sales chart.
6068676	6070017	This is based on U.S.
6070357	6072098	September sales.
6072138	6078242	Believe it or not, the Beatles was released September 9th and Guitar Hero 5 was released September 1st.
6078282	6080643	The Beatles has moved 595,000 units to 499 units of Guitar Hero 5.
6080703	6082424	Granted, that's really close
6087327	6106876	but also it should be noted that the All You Need Is Love download track 100,000 downloads in September so this is only considering September it's not considering the important Christmas period I don't want to start all this like OMG Guitar Hero 5 got his butt kicked but it is a little surprising considering Beatles Rock Band to some was kind of a niche title
6107176	6110559	I don't think it is I'm not remotely surprised, I'm surprised it didn't sell more
6131917	6134439	A lot of people are actually surprised the Beatles game didn't sell more.
6134759	6137541	But of course, you know, this game will move throughout Christmas.
6138181	6148247	I mean, both of these games are still going to continue to move, but it is a very... I mean, doesn't Guitar Hero... I mean, just taking the whole Beatles thing out of it, doesn't Guitar Hero usually tend to beat Rock Band on sales chart?
6148628	6151129	Well, it depends who you're asking because...
6152932	6182681	they say yeah we've sold more units well yeah you have like 5 times as many games coming out so yes you've sold more units so you can't really trust those numbers I mean look at even the Guitar Hero platform you've still got 2 more games coming out this year in Guitar Hero well Band Hero but come on it's Guitar Hero it's just E10 and then Van Halen that's still coming out too so it's a little oversaturation right now
6184104	6184885	Enough already!
6209707	6210747	It was actually pretty good.
6211287	6211947	Did you go see it?
6211987	6212248	Yeah.
6212468	6212748	Really?
6214528	6216968	I didn't like the last few because it's just hard to follow what's going on.
6217009	6221549	But this one actually took place after the last movie in chronology, which is awesome.
6222070	6224590	And they kind of explained a lot of things and I thought it was actually pretty decent.
6226490	6227851	But do you know what it got beat by?
6227911	6229491	Did it explain why people like it?
6229531	6230551	Where the wild things are, I'm guessing.
6230591	6230711	No.
6231111	6235212	It got beat by a little indie title that has made it big called Paranormal Activity.
6235692	6236312	I want to see that.
6236332	6236913	I should have figured.
6236933	6237933	It was the number one movie.
6238033	6238373	Now that...
6239418	6241280	I actually get to see that for free pretty soon.
6241760	6249026	Well, that movie's made a lot of buzz based off of the internet and Twitter.
6249366	6257032	You know, funny enough, we're 10 years, believe it or not, after the Blair Witch Project, which is a very similar kind of marketing, although technology's changed in the past 10 years.
6257372	6260655	But Paranormal Activity is sort of 2009's Blair Witch Project in a way.
6261315	6263037	They're marketing it like the Wii, whereas...
6264146	6269749	We're not going to put it out everywhere and you're going to hear how awesome this movie is and you're going to be like, I wish I could see it, but it's not in my town.
6269789	6273992	And then we're going to flood the market with it and then everyone goes and sees it.
6274972	6276153	So that's what they did this weekend.
6277093	6279515	Actdeft in chat says, enough is enough.
6280015	6283697	I've had it with these motherfucking saws in my motherfucking movies.
6284917	6287339	And that apparently might be what some people are saying about Guitar Hero.
6287419	6287699	I don't know.
6288305	6289286	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
6309426	6311328	Except for the fact that maybe they just put out too much.
6311348	6312289	Really, here's what comes out.
6312749	6314291	Here's what comes down to.
6314311	6316092	I don't think the Van Halen game was needed.
6316573	6318435	I think in the Metallica game and all this other stuff.
6318455	6319375	You don't need to buy them.
6320497	6322218	But Guitar Hero fans do buy them.
6322979	6326682	And then the reason you keep putting them out is because you keep buying them.
6326762	6327163	And you know...
6328260	6328901	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
6345309	6347049	Quick question chat and then we'll get into the next story.
6347190	6352371	Xlink asks, speaking of Saw basically, how many people have bought Saw the video game?
6352651	6353411	Any idea, Loki?
6354251	6355271	How that game's moving?
6355512	6356272	The Saw video game?
6357752	6359993	I don't know, but I can find out.
6360013	6361853	Look that up while Jamie brings us the next story.
6362093	6365474	If we can move on there and then we'll figure that out later.
6366468	6373754	Well, for people who are playing Marvel Ultimate Alliance 2, there actually is a future character coming up for download.
6374875	6375476	It's Cable.
6375776	6380520	Right now he's an NPC, but he will be downloadable to be playable.
6380780	6382381	I guess that's a pay to unlock type of thing.
6383462	6383602	And...
6385897	6390879	Yeah, I hope he's not overly imbalanced.
6391259	6396521	But also, for more missions, there's a Psylocke mission coming out too, which will be pretty cool.
6401803	6403624	Have you played the Ultimate Alliance game yet?
6404064	6404764	The new one?
6405224	6406625	No, it's still sitting right here on my desk.
6406805	6406985	Don't!
6407844	6408584	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
6435987	6437047	I mean, that's not great.
6437268	6438728	It only came out a couple weeks ago.
6439208	6440949	And this is only showing in the first two weeks.
6442770	6446071	But it has dropped in half versus week one, week two.
6446111	6449112	Maybe it'll bump up again with the new movie out and everything.
6449152	6450212	Halloween and all that, yeah.
6450252	6451533	Halloween, maybe.
6453134	6455575	PlayStation 3 version sold only 20,000 units.
6455675	6457035	So 50,000 total.
6458316	6460376	But once again, I bring up the point.
6460416	6463357	These publishers are putting out games that are only selling under 100,000 units or whatever.
6465916	6468698	President Cat could do quite well over here.
6468898	6478763	I mean, if their expectations are just to sell maybe a few hundred thousand units, if that, or even like a hundred thousand units, it's easy on the Wii.
6479043	6479804	Easy to do that.
6480084	6485547	Out of curiosity, and I apologize because I know we don't have the answer right in front of you, but how does this compare to Silent Hill Homecoming?
6485587	6492311	Because I know at one point they were talking about Saw was supposed to be like Konami's new series that...
6492711	6499253	I guess was going to coexist with Silent Hill, but you kind of get the weird feeling, are they going to try and replace Silent Hill with Saw?
6499513	6510196	Silent Hill Homecoming kind of took a lot of crap from the reviewers and the fact that they just outright cancelled the game for Japan, which kind of says something about their faith in the game as it is.
6510476	6512237	I don't think the game was terrible by any means.
6512917	6514117	It was different from the other games.
6514137	6516578	You could tell it was developed somewhere else, but I don't think it was bad at all.
6516958	6517698	Well, let's see.
6517898	6519779	In comparison, for example...
6520439	6525941	The Xbox 360 version now of Saw only sold 20,000 units in the first week.
6526421	6532203	The Xbox 360 version of Silent Hill sold 47,000 units in the first week.
6532963	6534684	Okay, there you go.
6535504	6542186	So, you know, about almost 30,000 more units and then continued to sell and still continuing to sell.
6544047	6546488	But, you know, once again, it's a little early to see, but...
6547406	6548246	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
6573567	6575368	And you don't just pull these numbers out of your ass.
6575408	6584271	I mean, you do a little bit, but keep in mind, for those that may not have listened to the show before, Loki, you work in distribution, so you have a pretty good thumbprint on, you know, who's ordering what.
6584331	6592454	Well, yeah, and I'm also looking at, there's a website, VGCharts, that pulls stuff from MPD numbers, so I'm looking at what the actual numbers were each week.
6592954	6599617	You know, Silent Hill on PS3 sold 41,000 units in the first week versus the 20 that sold, you know,
6600817	6605942	Not even 20, you know, probably like 15 for Saw, so.
6606223	6617374	Complete random-ass question I'm going to put out there, and maybe you don't even know the answer to this, but is there any highly anticipated game coming out this season that you're just noticing is not selling?
6617934	6619656	That you're just not selling copies of it?
6620297	6621578	I'm not selling copies of it.
6622199	6622319	Um...
6624548	6625128	Thanks for watching!
6647369	6648930	I'm putting you on the spot a little bit.
6649070	6650670	Rabbids Go Home isn't doing very well.
6651250	6654652	Not a lot of people are picking that up in large quantities like the other Rabbids games.
6655152	6656552	They're kind of getting worn.
6656813	6659574	I guess they've worn out their welcome.
6662094	6663055	I would say maybe...
6666795	6667255	Oh, man.
6667916	6672359	I had to beg and plead for Demon's Souls.
6673039	6675581	And then everybody after the fact was scrambling for that.
6675601	6676922	I'm like, dude, I told you.
6677222	6677922	You should have listened to me.
6678843	6680604	So is that game actually moving now?
6680764	6681425	Oh, yeah, it's moving.
6681725	6682825	They're sold out at Atlus.
6683006	6684507	I mean, they keep selling out.
6685187	6689690	So it's probably the fastest moving Atlus title I've seen.
6689710	6690651	Yeah.
6691704	6692145	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6705173	6712396	I'd say probably this fall, the one title that's not going to do as well as the company's hoping, I'm guessing, would be Avatar.
6712836	6714937	I don't think it's going to do that well, which is too bad.
6715037	6716177	Oh, the one based on the movie?
6716697	6717298	Yeah.
6717418	6718658	I think that movie's going to bomb.
6718678	6721059	I think that movie's going to be a big fucking bomb.
6721179	6722480	I'm not knocking it.
6722720	6727601	It actually looks kind of neat, but I just think it's going to be one of those movies that is, especially considering who's behind it.
6727621	6728162	The hype is too high.
6728282	6729822	The hype is way too high.
6729982	6731063	I think that movie's going to bomb.
6731363	6732303	Of course, watch me be wrong.
6733143	6733484	Who knows?
6735040	6739462	Well, this is something, you know, that may not sell a lot, but I think this looks freaking phenomenal.
6739502	6741142	Do you guys know what a Microsoft... Oh, I know one.
6741363	6741603	Oh, what?
6741643	6742923	And this is really sad.
6743243	6745324	Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles The Crystal Bearers.
6745624	6745904	Ooh.
6745944	6746685	That's a tough sell.
6747025	6751186	No one wants to buy it because the last one was a port of a DS title and everybody hated it.
6751527	6753968	And so they're like, oh, Crystal Chronicles, I'm not bringing that shit in.
6754248	6754468	Hmm.
6754588	6754728	So...
6756315	6756875	Thanks for watching!
6778584	6779065	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
6793638	6795199	Dungeons and Dragons, essentially.
6795639	6808344	It's using the surface table, get this, you can actually plot out little pieces on the map, and they actually show you a little tour of this, you can put pieces on the grid, so you can actually, you know how people get out their big charts and their pen and paper to move characters around?
6808584	6814146	Imagine being able to do all that on the surface, and look at that, D20 flying in, that you can actually roll there virtually.
6814386	6815287	And you can't cheat!
6816087	6820349	You can do that virtually there on the Microsoft Surface, and you can actually move these little pieces around.
6820809	6824292	Now this is going to make the nerds want to have one of these in their home.
6824332	6826054	I think this is pretty cool having this.
6826074	6828436	This is just a proof of concept for right now.
6829157	6833221	But I think a lot of people have looked at these surfaces going, what do you do with it?
6834497	6838099	There's not a lot to do here, but this is starting to get really expensive too.
6839120	6839580	Oh, I'm sure.
6839641	6842182	I mean, I've never seen one outside of that one hotel.
6842562	6851949	And it seems like that's where you're going to see them is in the lobbies of hotels for people to find coffee shops and expensive restaurants they want to go to and so forth.
6852489	6855651	Salacious Pop in chat says some casinos in Vegas are starting to use it.
6855691	6856592	Yeah, I can see that too.
6856612	6860134	Red Entertainment says Microsoft Surface is a cool thing to play around with.
6860895	6864037	It's like watching TV while high without actually being high.
6866440	6868262	It certainly is something a little different.
6869023	6869924	It's a cool little device.
6869964	6871426	I think it just might be a little ahead of its time.
6871686	6873509	It's not the kind of thing people are going to have in their homes.
6873849	6876993	You're not going to be replacing your coffee table with a surface at any time soon.
6877194	6877474	I will.
6877834	6878936	Then again, I don't have a coffee table.
6879863	6882305	Don't spill a drink on it, though, or you're fucked.
6882405	6884406	I mean, that's the other nervous thing about it.
6884426	6890811	Of course, then again, I've dropped my iPhone I don't know how many times, and it still works, but I also put a protective case on it.
6890891	6892792	I've dropped mine on concrete.
6892952	6893272	Oh, me too.
6893292	6895394	And it hasn't broken, and I don't have a case on mine.
6896092	6896512	Wow.
6896972	6905375	See, I have a big, thick case on mine because when I got my iPhone, I said, okay, I know this guy's going to get dropped, so I need to figure out a case I can put on it.
6905435	6907296	Wow, you don't even have a protective screen on it, do you?
6908056	6908737	That's pretty amazing.
6908817	6909077	Nope.
6909537	6909837	Wow.
6909877	6910537	Look at the back of it.
6911398	6912058	That's not bad at all.
6912178	6912278	Nope.
6912698	6913958	But then again... Yours is silver.
6913978	6914679	I didn't even know they made them.
6914699	6915439	The original ones.
6916139	6916279	Oh.
6916379	6917340	I have an old-school iPhone.
6917480	6917800	Interesting.
6919079	6923303	Which I'm going to auction off when I get my 3GS for a holiday.
6923364	6928549	I think those things are pretty waterproof because it looks like they have a picture, like a fancy picture.
6928569	6931872	It looks like someone in a casino that have their drinks set on it.
6932333	6939000	I think that because the monitor is actually so inside of it, you know, and the table goes way beyond the actual monitor.
6939020	6940862	If you spilled something, it would just drip over the edge.
6941162	6941302	Hmm.
6942283	6943323	One more comment from Red Entertainment.
6943403	6946464	NBC News used Surface during their 2008 election coverage.
6946824	6952185	Yeah, and also that probably has a lot to do with that Microsoft and NBC collaborate on a lot of stuff.
6952225	6953466	I mean, MSNBC, hello.
6954306	6962007	But then, you know, I like watching election year coverage because that's when all the channels try to roll out their new technology to get you to watch them.
6962288	6963988	Remember when CNN did the holograms?
6965413	6968316	I dropped my iPhone the other night and totally cracked the screen.
6968376	6971899	I don't know how many times I dropped it before and it had been fine.
6980427	6982048	Dan did his first time he got his.
6982268	6983469	He cracked it in his pocket.
6983689	6984970	So careful, careful, folks.
6985010	6988933	Yeah, I don't think I'll be buying one of these.
6989373	6991274	They're $12,500.
6992535	6997399	But you know, like in five years, that price is going to... Remember when HDTVs were $8,000?
6997459	6999660	I'm sorry, it's still way too damn expensive.
6999700	7004003	You get an HDTV, put a nice touchscreen interface on it, surface, done.
7004363	7007185	I mean, you don't really... I don't understand why this stuff's so expensive.
7007225	7007806	It's not a $12,000 unit.
7007886	7008286	I mean, come on.
7010087	7013569	Salacious Pop was just asking as we were talking about it on air because there's a little delay.
7013989	7016270	LOL, what channel did the Princess Leia shit?
7016590	7019251	That's a great way to describe what CNN did that year.
7020252	7024214	And Red Entertainment follows up with Wolf Blitzer, I am your father.
7025305	7025525	Love it.
7025545	7026005	So wrong.
7026405	7027065	Funny, funny, funny.
7056435	7075818	uh let's see really random topic and then we're going to get it into the mailbag your emails at mailbag at orange loss radio.com DarkSakura will read here in a moment but I'm going to throw out this completely random question from chat it's like throw random questions at Loki night I swear uh Deakman is asking Loki did you see this announcement that a custom firmware for the PSP 3000 is supposed to be released next week
7077059	7077500	Thanks for watching!
7095982	7098165	Alright, I'm gonna go look at this up.
7098546	7099887	Alright, you look it up.
7100208	7113344	In the meantime, DarkSakura's gonna dive into the mailbag at mailbag at orangelaundrater.com and read your emails, cause dang it, you send us emails and show us a little love, so we show you some love back in a little segment we call the mailbag.
7114125	7122712	Alright, um, hi LLR, thanks for reading my Twitter questions while playing on the short show about the official Konami DDR tournament.
7123193	7127836	Following up on it, I was wondering what you guys thought about the age restrictions on Konami's official DDR tournament.
7127937	7130299	I have enclosed a snippet about it on the official summary.
7131119	7136021	All registrants must be between the ages of 13 and 32 years as of April 1st, 2009.
7137101	7141403	According to these rules, I actually would be ineligible to compete next year if there was another tournament.
7141863	7143824	I'm not sure what to think.
7144664	7147145	Maybe they are thinking someone hits 32, they fall apart.
7148265	7156208	Anyway, give it the good work, peace out, and triple A. That's from Jammer J. I think that's stupid.
7157212	7159493	It's incredibly stupid and kind of insulting.
7159653	7162175	Especially to the fanbase that kind of helped DDR get big.
7162255	7166397	But this is exactly why I had no idea about this until you mentioned it.
7166417	7167037	Because guess what?
7167057	7167978	I stopped following it.
7168078	7168538	Then again?
7168598	7170099	Maybe that's why I'm not allowed to participate.
7170379	7170739	Then again?
7171920	7173761	Next year I won't be allowed to participate.
7173801	7175061	I was 32 April 1st of 2009.
7175522	7177443	I know, I know.
7177743	7179163	It's ridiculous.
7179464	7180204	I mean, it... Whatever.
7181545	7181845	Whatever.
7182583	7186304	If you want to alienate some of your potential fans that way, go for it.
7186564	7186964	Whatever.
7190165	7192446	I need a new nose, Rob.
7192866	7193326	It's weird.
7193406	7195367	I am and I'm not over the DDR thing.
7196167	7198228	Some days I go, I'm so done with DDR.
7198328	7200129	It's just not cool anymore.
7200169	7202409	But then I go, I kind of want that new one on the 360 PS3.
7202529	7204070	It looks kind of awesome.
7204410	7205990	My sheet metal came in the other day.
7207071	7208031	You know what that's for, right?
7209371	7211252	I know, for your little DDR project.
7211572	7214092	But you're still in your 20s, so whatever.
7214113	7214813	Oh, whatever.
7214893	7216013	I mean, barely.
7216213	7216813	Oh, God.
7218454	7220394	You young whippersnapper in your DDR mat.
7220934	7221694	Listen, okay.
7221714	7229916	Our way so far is getting official Konami stickers from the arcade machine that are going to go on this thing.
7229956	7231997	I mean, that's how awesome it's going to look.
7232157	7235538	Well, how do you feel that in four years or whatever, you're dead to Konami?
7236559	7238761	Deadman Walking, Deadman Dancing Deadman Dancing
7264110	7265551	Yeah, over DDR, sorry.
7265571	7268773	Which is just a scam to get you to buy more dance mats.
7269293	7279840	I know we have a lot of listeners that are still attached to the music games, and yes, we founded the station on it, but I guess now that some of us are getting that 32 threshold, I guess we are officially too old for DDR.
7279860	7280841	Well, here's the other thing, too.
7280981	7283743	I mean, look at their game releases for DDR.
7283983	7284704	They're not doing...
7285544	7288126	Game only releases, not until like way later on.
7288386	7292688	So if you want to really stick with DDR and buy a new release each year, guess what?
7292728	7294929	You're going to get Softmat to go with that release.
7295110	7297651	And it's going to be $10 more than it would normally be by itself.
7299212	7300272	However, I will say this.
7300793	7305776	If Beatmania 2DX or whatever goes to PlayStation 3, I'm very interested in what's next for that franchise.
7305796	7307216	Because I've always loved Beatmania.
7307396	7309398	Well, if it goes to the PlayStation 3, you can import that shit.
7310158	7311679	Ooh, I didn't even think of that.
7312139	7313000	Good point, my man.
7313160	7313520	Good point.
7315005	7315265	Anyhow.
7316386	7316946	More emails.
7317147	7317347	Sorry.
7317827	7319588	Sorry, I'm kind of feeling like crap right now.
7322330	7327693	This one is a Kingdom Hearts 358 two-day mini-review.
7329194	7335037	It's like, well, I'm saying this because you guys probably aren't going to play the game, so I thought that writing a review would help motivate you guys to buy it or at least rent it.
7335117	7335858	I beat it in a week.
7335978	7339300	Dude, please use punctuation and capitalize your thing, because...
7339861	7341502	I saw a commercial for the game on TV today.
7342542	7343242	Just random thought.
7343402	7349124	I never made it through the first game or played the second game or played the DS game.
7349144	7350144	I glitched my second game.
7350685	7353806	Or played the PlayStation 2 port of the Game Boy Advance game.
7354306	7359388	So I'm so lost in it right now that I'm just not going to even bother.
7359428	7360628	I'm going to sum this up.
7360688	7363269	You play as Roxas and he gives it an 8.
7364498	7365638	I don't even know who Roxas is.
7365718	7366779	I mean, I know who he is.
7367139	7371980	Okay, I know who he is because I've heard about the second game, but this character means nothing to me.
7372200	7377282	Rewrite your review with proper grammar and spelling and everything, and I'll put it up on the site.
7378862	7382963	I do love the Kingdom Hearts games, but I'm just not interested in these handheld ones.
7383283	7389085	And this all goes back to my whole, like, I'm just not as big of a fan of handheld games as I am playing them on my big TV.
7389645	7396349	So I'll wait until the next big official Kingdom Hearts 3 comes out and leave all these side stories on the side.
7397230	7399551	Alright, this one comes from AZHP.
7400372	7410198	Hey OLR, I was listening to one of your September podcasts catching up on the backlog you flooded the feed with and I remembered hearing that Rob said he got food poisoning from a sandwich chain that toasts its subs.
7410738	7411418	Well, I'm not surprised.
7411859	7417342	I used to work at Century Theater to save up for Nintendo Wii near one such store of that chain.
7417842	7417962	Gross.
7417982	7418182	Gross.
7418202	7418322	Gross.
7444017	7446940	Most of those stores are franchised anyway.
7447780	7450022	One by my work is super clean.
7450302	7451903	Well, they closed one not far from here.
7452464	7454145	The one that was in the Target lot closed.
7454205	7455806	Yeah, but I don't work over there.
7457167	7458128	They're not all doing great.
7459469	7459829	Okay.
7460510	7461751	Ooh, we got an angry letter.
7463312	7463812	Angry letter.
7463913	7465093	I love angry emails.
7465154	7465414	Yay!
7466280	7467701	and thankfully I sound like crap now.
7468242	7474047	Dear OLR, I listened to the podcast of the October 18th show and was honestly astounded at what I heard.
7474407	7480172	Upon reflection, what did I expect to come out of the mouths of people who live in the liberal enclave that is California?
7480772	7483355	How can you stand behind the possible presidency of Cat?
7483875	7492700	Cat has little foreign animal experience and no executive experience and likes the coherent strategy to deal with the growing threat presented by radical fundamental fleets.
7493741	7496282	I even doubt that Cat is even from this country.
7496422	7497763	I heard that Cat is a Persian.
7498904	7502125	Any rational person knows that the true and correct choice for president is Dog.
7503326	7508072	Dog has expressed his bath-based strategy for dealing with the threat of fleas once and for all.
7508573	7512738	Dog has a steady paw and is loyal to her previous president, President Burrow.
7514220	7521408	Yes, Dog has chased cars in the past, but after accepting Jesus as his Lord and Master, I can assure you that Dog will never chase cars again.
7522009	7530613	When you step into the gaming arena on Tuesday, remember who has stuck by you like a loyal friend who treats you like you are its pet and not the dominant person you are.
7531413	7532714	Vote for Dog for President.
7532874	7534115	Do it or the fleas win.
7534375	7538036	Thanks for letting me listen from the conservative Eden that is Utah Redertainment.
7538537	7542579	This message has been brought to you by Glenn Beck, a smart, rational, and sane voice for the future.
7543019	7545400	If that isn't proof that I'm clearly kidding, what else can I say?
7546806	7549687	Well, I'd have to say that Dog has been known to eat poop.
7551487	7555028	And honestly, Dog thinks I threw something when I just faked him out.
7555088	7561750	So I don't really know if I can trust Dog to not drool on the issues.
7562450	7564791	I can rely on Cat to be self-sufficient.
7565111	7566532	Except for Shermie, who's just fat and lazy.
7566552	7573398	Granted, Kat has eaten hair, so that's not as bad as poop, but still, both candidates have their flaws.
7573999	7575700	Redertainment, you ignorant slut.
7576401	7576982	No, I'm just kidding.
7577042	7578563	Actually, that was like the email of the century.
7578783	7579103	Loved it.
7579304	7580104	That's the best ever.
7580144	7580685	I'm saving it.
7581141	7582522	Gold star for you, sir.
7582722	7586445	I think that is worthy of the gold star email bag segment recipient.
7586465	7587446	Wouldn't you agree, DarkSakura?
7587866	7588407	Agreed.
7588467	7590429	Was proper grammar and punctuation all that used?
7590549	7590889	Quite.
7591149	7591710	So there you go.
7591750	7592890	Gold star recipient.
7592951	7593691	Applause to you.
7593971	7594272	Yay.
7594312	7595132	Close the fanfare, Rob.
7595953	7596874	I close the fanfare.
7597454	7598355	Do-do-do-do-do-do.
7598395	7599095	There's your fanfare.
7602038	7602919	Well done there, Rob.
7602979	7603239	Well done.
7603259	7603519	Thank you.
7604100	7605661	Does my fanfare get a gold star?
7606341	7607082	Yeah, something like that.
7607102	7607943	Your fanfare gets a...
7610339	7612801	My God, you're like really sick over there, aren't you?
7613122	7614223	It's the dust in the room.
7614263	7614743	Open the window.
7614963	7616585	What is dust in the room?
7616785	7624392	No, it's... I opened up my old laptop case to try to find my SD card reader, and it kicked up a crap ton of dust.
7625433	7626033	So, yeah.
7627295	7628556	All we are is dust in the room.
7630297	7633000	That's the official campaign song, by the way, of President Cat.
7634437	7634837	Not really.
7635058	7637360	Is that it for emails tonight?
7637741	7648372	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com if you want to send your email for possible reading on the air next week.
7648953	7650955	How much of that is getting picked up by the mics?
7651215	7651816	Probably a lot.
7653641	7654901	I hate my nose.
7654921	7655381	That's the story.
7655401	7656242	Alert the media.
7687962	7689063	F you to my nose.
7691005	7691745	And dust.
7692686	7693767	And did I mention my nose?
7693787	7695688	Because F you to my fucking nose.
7696129	7696949	And the fucking dust.
7697730	7698050	Loki.
7698691	7700652	F you to people that have a story about everything.
7701233	7704456	And I mean, like, we were watching people on the subway.
7705216	7706697	You know, riding Bart this weekend.
7707038	7713483	And there was, on the way there, a woman who was talking about... For some reason...
7714121	7715342	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7743399	7744900	Maybe he's into recycling.
7744960	7749222	Maybe he's rich in cans, because cans is the new currency.
7750943	7753145	Under the regime of President Cat.
7754566	7756187	Catnip is the new currency.
7757407	7761710	These people, though, just annoy the hell out of me.
7761830	7764671	They try to one-up everybody's stories and stuff like that.
7764711	7765472	You know how they have
7766195	7776779	You know, oh yeah, my cousin lives there, and oh my, I went there and did sheet metal work, and oh, and my dog was from that country and stuff, and like, isn't there a character like that on Saturday Night Live?
7776799	7777359	Yes, there is.
7777379	7778199	Alright, yeah, yeah, yeah.
7778580	7779980	I had ten baby cows.
7780640	7784902	I can't believe Loki just did a great impression of that.
7786246	7788366	We do impressions of that woman all the time.
7788406	7788787	It's hilarious.
7788827	7790107	Especially when we see people like this.
7790307	7792267	And we were doing that too while she was talking.
7792287	7795348	And I was like, and yeah.
7795468	7796968	And then we had Miley Cyrus follow us.
7797028	7798969	And we were making fun of her the entire day.
7799269	7800549	And Miley Cyrus followed us, right?
7800589	7802049	And she was playing music for us.
7802630	7807050	And then we went to our house on the moon.
7807431	7809811	And Miley Cyrus followed us because she's our slave.
7812372	7814052	So yeah, I hate people who have stories better.
7816678	7818559	Oh god, I can't follow that up, that's amazing.
7819100	7827144	Um, I guess my only FU would go to stress, because I have quite a lot of it at work right now, but, you know, it happens.
7827525	7830486	And FU to the fact that I haven't updated LiveJournal in like three weeks.
7831007	7832788	Like, I'm seriously falling behind on that stuff.
7833128	7835049	And, uh, yeah.
7835649	7837691	I don't like feeling behind on my life.
7838031	7842874	Kristen Wiig, that's... Oh yeah, she's like the only woman on that show right now, isn't she?
7843634	7845976	Did they ever fire the one that dropped the F-bomb on air?
7846596	7847177	Who was that?
7847477	7848898	Some new chick.
7848958	7850399	Remember her first show?
7850539	7851540	She dropped the F-bomb.
7851941	7855103	Because they gave her a character that said frickin', frickin', frickin' every other word.
7855123	7857666	And one time she just slipped and said, Fuckin', I would have done the same thing.
7858916	7859897	I've kind of felt bad for her.
7860718	7862039	So, anyhow.
7862720	7865863	And Red Entertainment would like to point out the name of that character is Penelope, the one-upper.
7865883	7867224	There you go.
7868286	7870888	And the chat room is saying bless you to Jamie because they can all hear her nose.
7871449	7872230	Sorry.
7872250	7872870	Sorry it happens.
7872890	7873711	Thank you, everybody.
7873791	7874372	I love you.
7874792	7875052	All right.
7875533	7877955	A couple more news stories for you guys, then the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR.
7877975	7878055	Loki?
7880697	7880857	Yes.
7881397	7884518	So, personally, I haven't played this game yet.
7884718	7887459	I acquired it for my MAME cabinet earlier today.
7888139	7889020	But the game is Toki.
7889520	7893501	It's a 2D side-scrolling game starring an ape.
7894321	7896682	And apparently it's getting the HD treatment.
7897442	7903604	The French developer Golgoth Studio is taking the game and completely redoing all the graphics in it.
7903624	7904764	And it actually looks pretty cool.
7905504	7906465	So I hope the game's fun.
7906945	7910166	But it looks like it's all hand-drawn now and...
7911499	7918745	I don't know, it's the stuff you would normally expect on BoxArt, but it's all in motion now.
7919965	7920146	Huh.
7920606	7924369	But apparently it'll be coming out for games for Windows Live and Xbox Live Arcade.
7925970	7932455	So it's not like a full retail game, it's kind of more of a mini-game if it's coming out on Arcade, but it looked kind of neat from the screenshots.
7932495	7934016	It could still be a full game, yeah.
7935197	7935717	It looks neat.
7935737	7936218	Interesting.
7937099	7937439	Interesting.
7938294	7941456	Well, here's some games that didn't do so great when they came out.
7941917	7949403	This story kind of caught our attention, and I don't like a whole lot of these top ten kind of lists, but this particular piece on GamesRadar.com, I thought was kind of interesting.
7949423	7953246	They ran a piece earlier this week called 18 Awesome Games That Died at Retail.
7953626	7962293	And what I thought about reading this list is I wanted to see how many of these games, Jamie, being the collector of obscure-ass video games, was going to pipe up and say, that game was awesome!
7963359	7964940	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7984513	7987095	That's one of those big games on GameTap, I think.
7987736	7989057	They were really selling that when that first came out.
7989077	7990558	Again, this is a list from GamesRadar.
7990578	7992619	18 games that died at retail.
7992920	8002847	Grand Theft Auto Chinatown War is a more recent game coming out because folks saying there's not enough mature games for the system, but at the same time, not enough Nintendo fans wanting mature games.
8003808	8004888	Why did this die, Loki?
8005729	8011533	I didn't really care to... I didn't like the way it played just because it was a top-down game.
8012154	8012274	Um...
8013284	8014455	I prefer more of like the
8015563	8019345	PSP versions and stuff that are more the 3D stuff you'd see on PlayStation 2.
8019425	8024627	I understand why they did it that way because the system might not be able to handle that.
8025107	8038534	However, now we see that Cop of the Recruit is coming out from Ubisoft and looks like what the PlayStation Portable versions of Grand Theft Auto were so it is possible to do it that way but they decided not to.
8039074	8042516	I think it'll have a better chance on the PSP probably.
8043796	8046597	Moving on with the list from GamesRadar.com, Psychonauts.
8046657	8049458	Of course, I'm sure a list like this just wouldn't be complete without Psychonauts.
8049898	8052279	It gets a lot of praise all around.
8052319	8058981	It was something that was originally supposed to be an exclusive for Microsoft but then got killed and brought back and just didn't really have a serious marketing push behind it.
8060061	8063405	I know Jamie will get behind this one, Jet Grind Radio on the Dreamcast.
8063525	8063986	Hell yeah.
8064166	8066208	One of the 18 games that tanked here.
8066608	8072114	Unfortunately, just being the fact that it was on the Dreamcast console put a damper in it there.
8075875	8078397	Metal Storm is on this list.
8078517	8083140	This is an old-ass NES side-scrolling game, like on the old-school 8-bit NES.
8083160	8085001	That was pretty sweet, too.
8085021	8087843	1991, but unfortunately, it didn't really sell very well.
8088563	8096828	They're saying it might have something to do with the fact that it was a crappy localization process and the cutscenes were taken out when it was brought over and it screwed with the color palette.
8098309	8098890	Shenmue 2.
8100489	8101109	I think I have that somewhere.
8101129	8102130	I think I have that somewhere.
8126673	8134520	Earth Defense Force Oddworld, Stranger's Wrath on the Xbox is on the list Armed and Dangerous for the PC
8135856	8165471	Otogi 2 Immortal Warriors I never even heard of this game but it was a Japanese hack and slasher about like an ancient swordsman it was a sequel to a game that apparently didn't do too well in the first place Space Station Silicon Valley on the N64 it was kind of a whimsical little platformer robot animal type of game that just got lost in the whole N64 not being one of Nintendo's greatest systems Panzer Dragoon Orta from 2003 is on the list that was a good game
8166744	8170086	The Last Express Bionic Commando
8188137	8189198	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
8209895	8213616	Grim Fandango, also on the list, getting down towards the end here.
8213656	8216576	The Neverhood, from 1996, on the list.
8216956	8221777	And last but not least, Okami made the list, which isn't surprising at all.
8222217	8228258	And the reason why Okami kind of got burned, it was out on the PlayStation 2, kind of when the next generation of games was already starting.
8228518	8231339	You know, and the PS2 was already dying out for a lot of hardcore gamers.
8231639	8233659	I think that was one of the biggest problems with Final Fantasy XII.
8233739	8234659	I think it came out too late.
8235419	8238020	And by the time Final Fantasy XII came out, it should have been on the next-gen system.
8239020	8240121	But that's just me.
8241902	8242242	Alright.
8243603	8248646	I guess we're getting to that part of the show where we're going to open up the Skype line and hear from you guys.
8248666	8254610	1-877-GAME-OLR is the number you want to call if you want to get on the show or you can just Skype us directly at Orange Lounge Radio.
8255010	8256571	I do want to give a little disclaimer first.
8256591	8260653	We've been having problems with Skype the past couple weeks where we've been randomly hanging up on callers.
8261013	8263235	We did upgrade to a new version of Skype.
8263895	8265555	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
8293961	8294982	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
8316812	8318454	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?
8318474	8320175	Hola, bienvenidos a Orange Launch Radio, quien es?
8345063	8352367	Remember, you should always check your microphone connection calling Echo 123 on Skype before you give us a call.
8352427	8353648	Otherwise, it may not work.
8353908	8355629	But I could swear I heard somebody breathing there.
8355809	8357250	Maybe they just couldn't hear us for some reason.
8357770	8357970	Huh?
8358170	8358951	I heard someone breathing.
8359051	8359551	I could too.
8359671	8361052	So I don't know what the hell was going on there.
8361652	8363333	So somebody was not paying attention.
8364854	8365655	Don't know what happened there.
8367296	8369257	Do we have any other... Actually, here we go.
8369277	8370077	We got another call coming in.
8370558	8371618	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
8371638	8372038	Who's this?
8373619	8374260	Hey, it's Mr.
8376038	8377858	Hey, SSJ100 Matt, how are you?
8379359	8380159	I'm doing good.
8380279	8382319	I'm doing well, actually.
8382359	8383540	You're cutting out a little bit.
8383580	8385620	I don't know what's going on, but what are you up to tonight?
8387141	8390961	Actually, I just got out of Video Games Live.
8391662	8393142	Video Games Live?
8393182	8394342	Was it in New York City tonight?
8395703	8396143	It was.
8396663	8397463	How was the show?
8399943	8400704	It was great.
8400724	8401404	I went to other...
8402652	8407656	I went to the Dear Friends concert a while back when it was done, and this was a lot better.
8407716	8409518	This is the first one I did.
8409538	8412640	Well, I think the best one was when he did the encore, it was Chrono Trigger.
8431689	8431990	Uh-huh.
8432070	8432270	Uh-huh.
8444135	8448316	And I just want to point out, we realize SSJ100Mad is breaking up.
8448376	8449957	His connection is kind of crap.
8450017	8456058	I don't know if that's because of the new Skype or what's going on, but we're going to try and get through this because I want to talk about Video Games Live a little bit.
8456078	8460599	The Chrono Trigger piece, we were there the night that debuted in Oakland.
8460619	8463000	That was an awesome night, so a good piece.
8463060	8465200	I'm glad that came out.
8466121	8467021	Any lowlights?
8467201	8471762	Were there songs that they were playing where you were kind of like, they could have bumped this for something else?
8476146	8476686	Not really.
8476746	8486612	I mean, it was cool that they brought in Mega Man, which I don't think they brought in previous shows.
8487653	8496798	But to Jamie's surprise, they did play Castlevania songs.
8497899	8499059	Did they have any guests show up?
8499100	8501321	Because sometimes they have random guests show up at these things.
8503406	8509828	Well, they did have a kid from YouTube that played Mario songs blindfolded.
8510548	8511309	Oh, on the piano?
8511369	8512629	He was there when we went.
8512649	8514690	Yeah, I think Tommy has him on the payroll or something.
8514730	8515570	He follows him everywhere.
8516690	8516930	Yeah.
8517551	8526013	And also, they called in, I'm trying to think of his name, Ross Baer, the creator of Pong.
8526874	8527354	Oh, nice.
8529134	8531055	So, that was interesting.
8531718	8532678	Take care, buddy.
8532698	8532878	All right.
8532898	8533098	Let's see.
8559759	8563961	Moving on to more calls and more last-minute stories here on Orange Lounge Radio.
8564021	8568643	I hope that was just an isolated thing and not something that's going to continue.
8569163	8569543	We'll see.
8570504	8571384	He said he was somewhere.
8571604	8571864	I don't know.
8571884	8572464	He was cutting out.
8572484	8574265	I think he said he was at a game or something, so we'll see.
8574805	8576066	We'll try to get a couple more calls here.
8576086	8577546	877-GAME-OLR.
8577646	8579007	Loki, do you have any other last-minute stories?
8579147	8580108	DS Master 25 What's on your mind?
8604171	8606672	Well, kind of a sad story today.
8608052	8608492	What's that?
8608512	8611733	All right.
8613294	8617275	As soon as I get done... What the hell is going on?
8617335	8618095	Is there an argument?
8618155	8619755	Is somebody breaking a dish behind you?
8619815	8620516	What is going on?
8621256	8621876	My mother.
8622476	8623196	Is she yelling at you?
8623216	8626997	Basically, my DS... Who are you talking to?
8627358	8629138	I'm on the radio, Mom.
8629298	8629878	Come on.
8630498	8631319	It's 11 o'clock.
8631399	8632399	Okay, okay.
8632459	8632679	Jesus.
8633822	8638983	Basically, the L button on my DSI died, and it's only been like a few months.
8640564	8643444	And I don't know if any of our listeners have had that problem.
8645785	8647705	Is your mom mad that you're calling in so late?
8649046	8649646	Probably.
8650046	8652286	You shouldn't say Jesus in front of your mother like that.
8652927	8654427	That's usually frowned upon, just so you know.
8658388	8685095	you realize your whole call has just been shot because now everybody's just saying mom I'm on the radio sorry but basically my DSI the stupid L button stopped working in the middle of 3D pinball of all things I'm sorry to hear it but mom's not going to buy you a new one if you keep staying up late to call stupid internet radio programs
8686141	8688623	Well, anyways, I do have a good game review, though.
8689063	8689544	Oh, please.
8689724	8692807	Kingdom Hearts, Jaren Fitgate, over two days.
8694108	8705457	I will say here, I've been a long-time Square fan, even though I kind of despised them on the first Kingdom Hearts, because I'm like, what the hell are you thinking, Square?
8706038	8706999	Combining with Disney?
8707139	8707919	You're stupid.
8709281	8713264	Well, you know, and then a friend told me, don't knock it till you try it.
8713834	8716675	So, you know, and I fell in love with this series right then and there.
8717715	8722137	And when Kairi left, I kind of cried.
8723598	8731080	And basically now I'm still on the search for in this one, which is supposed to be the real link between 1 and 2.
8731160	8735622	So unfortunately I had to sell my PlayStation 2 off because of the overdraft.
8736482	8741524	But I'm planning on getting one again just to play the rest of the Kingdom Hearts series again.
8743533	8745454	Your mom didn't see you crying in a video game, did she?
8747014	8751215	No, my girlfriend did, though, and she kind of cried along.
8751235	8754356	She's like, no, Kyrie, don't leave.
8754436	8755237	Well, that's okay.
8755297	8758538	You know, chicks seeing you cry, that just scores you points with them.
8758558	8760758	But you don't want your mom to see you cry because then she thinks you're a wimp.
8760778	8761178	That's right.
8763119	8769161	Yeah, I'm surprised my father is already bashing the whole Hannah Montana stuff and saying, at least you're playing good music.
8770681	8772422	Wait, are you a Hannah Montana fan?
8773843	8776485	I was the one who sent in that angry message.
8776585	8778847	You know, remember, leave Hannah alone.
8779368	8780348	Do you guys remember that?
8781309	8782710	I try every day to forget.
8784612	8785393	Episode 271.
8785553	8789015	Oh, don't look it up.
8789056	8789576	I don't remember.
8789596	8791437	That would have only been like two years ago.
8791578	8791978	That's all right.
8792338	8792638	All right.
8792859	8794020	This isn't going to get any better.
8794040	8797182	DS Master 25 or 26 or whoever you are.
8797242	8797963	We've got to wrap up.
8798023	8799464	It's way past your bedtime, young man.
8799824	8801586	But any other last minute thoughts before we let you go?
8803642	8807244	Beatmania 2DX17 for PS3 is going to rock.
8807505	8809005	I'm importing it with a PS3.
8809065	8810426	That's indefinite.
8810446	8810686	Bye.
8810806	8811006	Perfect.
8811027	8811227	Later.
8811247	8811527	Go to bed.
8811547	8811607	Wow.
8811627	8811967	That's like
8822358	8827402	and then it got worse and then it got worse.
8827422	8829103	You have to admit that call was pretty epic.
8829143	8830104	That was pretty awesome.
8830985	8831405	It was cool.
8831465	8833407	I kind of feel bad for him, but that's all right.
8834227	8835448	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
8835488	8835909	Who's this?
8837650	8843514	Hello, this is Ray or Ray Force, whatever you go on in Orange Lounge Radio.
8843735	8844455	What's up, Ray?
8844715	8845276	What's on your mind?
8846537	8846757	Hmm.
8847406	8852530	Well, this past week, I managed to get my hands on a Street Fighter 4 5-in-6 tournament edition.
8852550	8855272	It had a big stick with the real arcade parts.
8855912	8856233	Mm-hmm.
8857994	8858715	And what did you think?
8858735	8866040	So, I thought... I was playing mostly, like, shooter-type games, like... Riding Fires and such with it.
8866180	8875247	It takes some time getting used to it, especially with the square well, but... Instead of, like, having an octagonal well or a circular one, but once you get used to it, like... Playing a...
8877177	8880420	How expensive is this thing?
8880480	8888765	I guess that kind of stuff tends to go down in price, though, after just a little bit of time.
8888825	8891968	Because haven't those been out a little while?
8907389	8908030	Since February.
8908070	8913639	Yeah, they've been out for nearly a year now, and I believe the friars around me are starting to run out of them.
8916505	8918707	Honestly, if you're going to build your own, it's a lot cheaper.
8919027	8919267	Really?
8919327	8920988	Because I actually thought about getting one of those.
8921148	8923690	I think we're thinking of the same device.
8923950	8925371	I was thinking about getting one of those a while ago.
8925571	8934738	Yeah, you can basically, if you get the encoder board for it, which they're not that expensive, the actual buttons and everything, it'll cost anything.
8934798	8935418	I'm not you.
8935518	8936839	I can't build my own stuff.
8936879	8937720	Would I be able to do this?
8937740	8938060	It plugs in.
8938120	8939041	I mean, my God.
8939862	8940282	Switch.
8940982	8941343	Fine.
8942003	8942603	It's simple.
8942623	8943504	You'd be surprised.
8944505	8945365	Be very surprised.
8945506	8945966	All right.
8947082	8948243	So, Ray, was it worth the money?
8950604	8951524	Was it worth the money?
8963289	8969572	What I kind of like about what you're saying is that you're not actually using this to play Street Fighter 4, but that you're using it to play, like, other games, like shooters and stuff.
8969912	8973054	Because I think, seriously, if I were to get one of these, I'd actually use it to play, like, Soul Calibur.
8974878	8976920	Well, I suck horribly at fighters.
8977000	8983027	I mean, I'm mostly, I'm a schmuck person first, and a fighting game person, like, way further down.
8987051	8987912	I don't think it's worth it.
8989714	8989994	Alright.
8990835	8994178	Well, buddy, do you have anything else you want to talk about tonight?
8994279	8995460	Any other games you've been playing lately?
8996827	9001489	I'm playing Space Invaders Extreme too, but I haven't played it for long, so I'll probably call in by next week.
9001989	9002529	Yeah, please do.
9002569	9005090	I'm very curious to hear about that game, because I did enjoy the first one.
9005110	9006550	I want to hear about what's new in the second one.
9008331	9012313	You know, I'll have that later when there's more time to talk.
9012653	9017574	Most of my calls this time are on my arcade stick, so any other people who can't be called.
9017794	9018635	We'll arrange something.
9020215	9020495	Okay.
9020715	9021536	Alright, take care, buddy.
9021736	9023236	Hey, hey, you're in the Bay Area.
9023336	9024777	Any chance we're going to see you at Umlaut?
9027056	9027897	I'm not sure.
9029377	9033279	If on a Wednesday, I'm not sure if I'll be able to make it on Thursday.
9033299	9034720	That's past 9 a.m.
9035440	9037801	And that's in San Jose, not San Francisco.
9038262	9038882	Oh, yeah, that's right.
9039262	9040003	You're in the South Bay.
9040383	9041123	Well, we'll see.
9041583	9042324	It is a weeknight.
9042364	9042824	That's tough.
9042884	9046186	But hopefully we'll see some of our Bay Area friends able to get up there.
9046346	9047526	So it's going to be a fun night.
9047946	9048347	All right, buddy.
9048367	9048907	Thanks for calling.
9050319	9051240	Alright, see ya Later
9072059	9076846	Just real quick, there's a new indie game that's on Xbox Live Indie Games called Pumpkin Shop.
9077306	9082433	And yes, this would be the perfect time of the year to release a pumpkin carving sim.
9082954	9088922	So you can do just that without the mess and have your own virtual pumpkin that no one can smash against your porch.
9090663	9093546	No word on how expensive that is, but that is called Pumpkin Shop.
9093747	9095068	Sounds a little ridiculous to me.
9095309	9095789	It looks neat.
9095829	9097952	It'd be cool if you could share it with your friends.
9097972	9099674	If you want to carve a pumpkin, carve a pumpkin.
9100455	9106462	I'm surprised there's not a Facebook app to do that and you share it with your friends so that you get annoying little notices and stuff.
9106542	9108324	Yeah, I'm kind of surprised there isn't that too.
9108344	9109806	But now that you said it, there'll probably be one.
9112162	9112462	Is that it?
9112783	9117628	It's a shame that there's not millions of dollars coming into my mailbox each day because that would be tragic.
9117848	9118089	I know.
9118129	9119210	You could start your own game company.
9119270	9122574	Release the pumpkin carving Facebook app.
9122634	9123735	Release President Cat.
9124135	9125237	You'd be a rich man.
9125857	9127539	We'll see what we can do with President Cat.
9127579	9129982	I mean, it's just a matter of giving... That sounds like a threat.
9131738	9132258	Thanks for watching!
9153131	9157973	They don't release that many games a year, so I think that their budget might be really low.
9158293	9165976	I'd say both them and UFO Interactive would be good candidates to bug about releasing the game over here.
9167257	9172059	And then followed by maybe... I'm not sure about Ignition or...
9174830	9175631	Oh, who was the other one?
9176332	9181037	Yeah, like Ignition, because they really only release certain types of games over here.
9181197	9183379	You know, really a lot of the RPGs and that kind of stuff.
9183799	9185561	So that wouldn't really fit with them.
9185701	9189706	But Axis Game Localization, man, it's all sorts of weird shit.
9191488	9197272	Graffiti Interactive would be good too, but they're really low budget and it takes forever for them to get stuff out.
9197392	9200113	Well, if you guys send out emails out there, we definitely want to see.
9200253	9202495	Send your responses, the responses you get back from companies.
9202555	9203195	We'll post something.
9203355	9203955	I'll post something.
9204416	9209859	If there's a thread in our forums for it, we'll post the information of where we need to go with that.
9210419	9217823	You know, I loved the excuse me, I loved the way people used the photo stream last week to show pictures of President Cat and their fan art.
9218243	9222226	So I would like to encourage people this week, you know, we're still a little bit on our President Cat kick.
9222266	9223686	We'll think of a new theme maybe next week.
9224147	9230490	But continuing on that, I would really like to see in the photo stream and email your pics to pics at orange lingerie dot com.
9230770	9232671	They go right up on our website when you do that.
9232751	9238615	So, you know, I would like to see conceptual box art for this game if released in the U.S.
9239215	9239996	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
9261255	9270398	Maybe an online petition might not hurt because at least it shows, okay, look, there's a few hundred people interested in getting this game over here to see what we can do.
9270418	9275780	It gives people focus to make their mark or something like that, and we'll go from there.
9276721	9277021	All right.
9277801	9281722	Well, if that's it for Last Minute Stories tonight, then we're going to go around and get everybody's final thoughts.
9281983	9284563	DarkSakura, your final thought tonight.
9284944	9285984	Loki, your final thought tonight.
9287469	9294881	my final thought is I have my arcade cabinet in my house and now I gotta finish it my final thought is I want chicken
9295984	9300126	I'll play a loco to be exact, which reminds me of this week's episode of South Park, which is kind of funny.
9300426	9303807	So anyhow, that's going to do it for this week's episode of Orange Launch Radio.
9303847	9307369	Just a word to the wise out there, those folks that are listening live.
9307949	9310270	We have Daylight Savings Time kicking in next week.
9310330	9313191	So it's spring forward, fall back.
9313591	9315912	So we will be moving the clocks back an hour here.
9315972	9319694	So if you don't celebrate Daylight Savings Time in your country or where you are.
9319714	9320954	We're looking at you, Arizona.
9320974	9322235	Yeah, please plan accordingly.
9322935	9324016	Yeah, it's Arizona that doesn't have it.
9324056	9327417	So please plan accordingly for those of you folks that don't have daylight savings time.
9328738	9330779	And my – I guess that was it.
9331599	9332720	Yeah, I get my final thought.
9332820	9333360	We're good to go.
9333860	9338403	I always like to say also if you enjoyed Orange Lounge Radio, please tell two friends about the show.
9338723	9342425	Help spread the word because remember we have no big magazine backing us up.
9342505	9344546	We have no advertising dollars.
9344606	9345967	We rely strictly on word of mouth.
9346007	9347427	We do the show for free, no ads.
9347868	9348608	So, you know.
9349073	9350574	It's not even 9 o'clock yet.
9350794	9351034	I know.
9351074	9352675	It's kind of early tonight.
9352715	9353055	Not really.
9353095	9355796	It's still been an almost three-hour show, maybe two and a half.
9356316	9357457	But it's time to wrap it up.
9358017	9358637	Get on out of here.
9359198	9359898	Have a good night, everybody.
9359918	9360678	We'll see you next week.
9360698	9364340	We'll be back with more of Orange Lounge Radio on November 1st.
9365100	9366861	I can't believe it's almost the end of the year already.
9366941	9369002	We're getting into the very, very busy game season.
