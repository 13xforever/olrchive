14000	19000	Tonight, October 25th, 2009, a major new score burns computer games while you wait.
19000	22000	We have an interview about the upcoming charity event, Ooh Loud,
22000	27000	and some crappy little podcast once an obscure Japanese title released in the US.
27000	34000	Orange Lounge Radio
34000	51000	Music
51000	53000	Heard any good jokes lately?
53000	57000	Hi, and welcome to another edition of Orange Lounge Radio.
57000	65000	That's a podcast dedicated to video games, video gaming, gamer lifestyle, and of course, kittens!
65000	71000	Cute, adorable, fluffy kittens.
71000	74000	My name is Rob Roberts, joining you for the next few hours.
74000	79000	Of course, as with me as always, say hello to the one and only secretary of catnip,
79000	82000	Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.
82000	88000	And of course, the one and only secretary of defense, Techmaster Loki.
88000	89000	Hello.
89000	90000	He cleans the cat box.
90000	92000	I do.
92000	94000	How are you guys doing tonight?
94000	96000	It's been an interesting week.
96000	98000	Been a very interesting week.
98000	100000	It's been a unique week.
100000	102000	It's been a very unique week here at Orange Lounge Radio.
102000	105000	I have to say, in the seven and a half years we've been doing Orange Lounge Radio,
105000	107000	I haven't quite seen anything like it.
107000	111000	Usually at Orange Lounge Radio, we start off the show talking about our gaming weeks,
111000	115000	but in spite of things going on, we thought we might change that up a little bit
115000	117000	and start off tonight with some news.
117000	120000	And we're going to head over to Joystiq with a Q.
120000	122000	Of course, we like them over at Joystiq.
122000	124000	They run lots of fun little game stories.
124000	126000	They ran a story this week.
126000	129000	Fans campaigning for President Cat.
129000	130000	I love that picture.
130000	134000	Against all odds, a completely random Japanese Wii game starring a cat blogger
134000	137000	has become a hot topic among some fans.
137000	143000	Sukiban Sachurena Wii stars a cat named Rena from a popular Japanese blog
143000	145000	as the CEO of Cat Queen, Inc.
145000	148000	You play as a cat going through the initiation into the company,
148000	150000	performing various minigames to earn Rena's respect.
150000	151000	That's not really true.
151000	152000	Oh, really?
152000	153000	You don't play a cat.
153000	154000	Oh, what?
154000	155000	You play a person.
155000	156000	Oh, really now?
156000	157000	Yes.
157000	158000	How do you know this?
158000	159000	Because you see the person in the game that you're playing.
159000	160000	You dodge flying cats.
160000	161000	I see.
161000	164000	The Orange Lounge Radio podcast discovered the game,
164000	166000	which they have dubbed President Cat.
166000	168000	I like that, that we just dubbed it that.
168000	169000	Hey, they like it.
169000	172000	I shall call it President Cat.
172000	173000	Hey, they like it.
173000	174000	They did.
174000	177000	Then began tweeting the Wii game's official account.
177000	180000	Fans started sending messages of encouragement and support
180000	182000	to the President Cat hashtag,
182000	185000	and the Rena account has started responding in both Japanese and English,
185000	189000	revealing that the publisher is excited and a little confused
189000	191000	about all this sudden attention.
191000	195000	It would be hilarious if this grassroots movement resulted in the localization
195000	198000	of a weird licensed game.
198000	202000	However, it would also be pretty sad if the publisher turned out to lose money on it.
202000	204000	It's definitely something we want to play,
204000	207000	but we're not exactly representative of the mainstream audience.
207000	213000	That story coming from J.C. Fletcher over at Joystick.
213000	216000	I want to dodge flying cats.
216000	219000	Obviously, we're a little surprised, probably like most people,
219000	222000	that this actually made game blogs this week.
222000	225000	A number of them.
225000	228000	Some people might think it was a grab for attention,
228000	229000	but no, please.
229000	232000	We've done far worse desperate cries for attention on this show in the past.
232000	233000	This was nothing.
233000	238000	What's also interesting about this is that it's not like this is the first game
238000	240000	we've ever said they should bring over from Japan.
240000	244000	This is the first one that we've actually contacted the company roundaboutly.
244000	245000	Kind of.
245000	248000	Think about what the show was based on, what we started the show on.
248000	249000	DDR, right?
249000	250000	Yeah.
250000	255000	How long did it take for DDR to finally come from Japan to the U.S.?
255000	256000	Did we have Twitter back then?
256000	257000	No, we didn't.
257000	258000	So?
258000	261000	Yeah, so certainly Twitter's changed things up a little bit.
261000	264000	You know, and all the obscure Japanese title we talked about in the past.
264000	265000	So it's interesting, you know,
265000	270000	and I understand why Joystick is saying what they do at the end there.
270000	272000	They have to kind of show both ends of the story that, you know,
272000	274000	well, it would be a darn shame if they localized this game
274000	275000	and it ended up in bargain bins.
275000	280000	But dude, the fact that you guys ran the article as well as a variety
280000	282000	of other sites ran the article.
282000	284000	Like Go Nintendo and Destructoid.
284000	288000	Means that people obviously saw something in it, I think.
288000	292000	You know, that wasn't in some of the games we talked about in the past.
292000	293000	And so it's very interesting.
293000	296000	It just goes to show the moral of the story.
296000	298000	America...
298000	299000	Loves cats.
299000	300000	Loves cats.
300000	304000	And I'm not, when I say America, I mean collectively the world
304000	307000	that listens to this show, we just happen to be in America.
307000	311000	But, you know, our friends in Australia, Canada, Mexico, Europe,
311000	313000	they all fucking love cats too.
313000	318000	And I think it just goes to show that people would like to see a game like this.
318000	320000	Not everybody wants to see a game like this.
320000	322000	Of course, you look at the comments on this and, you know,
322000	324000	the other sites that ran the article and there's people saying,
324000	326000	this game looks stupid.
326000	328000	Yeah, they probably also like Madden.
328000	332000	And my point would be there are some people that look at games like Madden
332000	334000	and go, well, that's stupid.
334000	336000	Like me. I go a lot stupid to Madden.
336000	338000	I don't think Madden is stupid.
338000	340000	I just, it's not my kind of game.
340000	341000	I think it's a waste of my time.
341000	344000	But I bet there are people out there that would say Uncharted 2 is stupid.
344000	349000	This game that gets critical praise, lavish, left and right upon it.
349000	350000	Somebody thinks it's stupid.
350000	353000	I don't, but, you know, somebody out there probably does.
353000	354000	I will say it's stupid.
354000	355000	You haven't even played it.
355000	356000	No, I haven't.
356000	357000	You just want to be controversial.
357000	358000	I know.
358000	361000	See, that's that desperate cry for attention people talk about.
361000	362000	It's not.
362000	365000	I am unique just like everyone else.
365000	367000	So here's the thing, though.
367000	373000	The point behind this, and if you go back on the show weeks and weeks,
373000	375000	years and years, months and months, whatever,
375000	377000	we've talked about this for a long time.
377000	380000	It has to do with risk taking.
380000	384000	For example, Konami really missed the boat when it came to making guitar
384000	386000	games in the U.S., didn't they?
386000	387000	Oh, hell yeah.
387000	390000	They had a guitar and drum game out for years and years in Japan
390000	392000	that they could have released over here.
392000	395000	But when they did it, they did a half-assed job with it.
395000	397000	And same thing goes for Beatmania is that, you know,
397000	401000	they transferred everything in Japan, kind of figuring it would work over here,
401000	404000	didn't really invest a lot of time or money into it.
404000	407000	And so they didn't really take a big risk.
407000	410000	I mean, sure, they, I guess, took a little risk in putting the game out
410000	412000	over here, which paid off for them with DDR.
412000	413000	Yeah.
413000	414000	You know.
414000	415000	Beatmania, not so much.
415000	420000	But a lot of Japanese companies, I think, are afraid to take risks sometimes
420000	425000	because they think Americans don't get it or we're not going to get it.
425000	428000	Well, let this past week be a lesson.
428000	432000	There's a lot of people over here that get it,
432000	435000	or else this story would have, nobody would have cared,
435000	438000	just like the past other hundred games we've talked about on the show
438000	440000	that should be over here.
440000	444000	I'm thinking about doing a Sharmi blog as tribute.
444000	446000	So, I don't know, Loki, what are your thoughts on this whole thing?
446000	448000	You actually got the game this week, right?
448000	449000	Yes, I did.
449000	450000	And what did you think?
450000	452000	Is it worth all our hype?
452000	455000	Did this get out of hand, what?
455000	458000	Well, I don't know, it may have gotten out of hand a little bit,
458000	462000	but it's a fun game, from what I can understand.
462000	466000	Obviously, I don't get a lot of the stuff that's going on in the game
466000	469000	because it's all in Japanese, but the little mini-games in there are fun,
469000	473000	and it's funny to watch them, and it's just weird.
473000	476000	So, it's got that kind of appeal, and I think it'd be a little bit better
476000	477000	if it was in English.
477000	479000	How much of it is spoken?
479000	481000	There's a lot of it. Well, it's not really spoken,
481000	484000	it's just kind of in text boxes.
484000	485000	Oh.
485000	489000	But, you know, it's fun.
489000	492000	Definitely would pick it up if it came out over here.
492000	495000	And, you know, as I posted in Twitter and stuff,
495000	498000	there's been a few other cat games that have come out over here,
498000	500000	more like the cat-raising systems, like, you know,
500000	503000	the dog's kind of crap.
503000	506000	Imagine cats, and they also have purr pals and stuff like that.
506000	510000	And you have to understand, even though a lot of people
510000	513000	don't get these kind of games on the Wii,
513000	516000	the Wii has so many units out there, it doesn't matter.
516000	519000	It takes such a small percentage of the people out there
519000	521000	to sell a lot of units of this.
521000	523000	For example, those other cat games.
523000	526000	200,000 units and 400,000 units.
526000	529000	And they were shit. They were absolute shit.
529000	532000	But people will buy anything that comes out on the Wii.
532000	535000	And if you put President Cat on the front of that box,
535000	538000	you better believe that hundreds of thousands of people
538000	542000	will pick up the game, even if it completely stunk.
542000	545000	Which is good because this game doesn't stink,
545000	549000	but, you know, it's quirky and it's fun and it's got minigames in it,
549000	552000	and trust me, there's so many minigame collections,
552000	555000	party games out there, it'll fit right in.
555000	558000	What do you think is the fear about putting a game like this
558000	560000	out in the US?
560000	563000	I mean, clearly the developers behind this game, who granted,
563000	565000	we blindsided a little bit last week,
565000	567000	but we kind of never thought they'd care.
567000	570000	So it's kind of really cool that they actually responded in the first place,
570000	574000	and I think speaks very highly of the company in the first place,
574000	575000	you know, despite all this.
575000	577000	But what do you think is the fear?
577000	580000	I mean, there's plenty. We read off Japanese releases every week,
580000	582000	and many of them don't come over here.
582000	585000	Why do you think? Do they just think we don't get it?
585000	587000	It's just not the kind of game that would do well here?
587000	589000	What is the fear?
589000	592000	I think that it's just a lot of money that goes into localizing the game,
592000	595000	and if they don't feel that they're going to sell enough units,
595000	598000	then they're just not going to bother with it.
598000	603000	But then I look at companies like Atlus, or even Axis game localization,
603000	606000	or even Ignition, whatever.
606000	608000	I mean, a lot of their games that come out over here
608000	612000	that they decided to put out on the Wii, or even the DS and stuff,
612000	614000	don't sell that many units.
614000	619000	Atlus especially, they don't sell a lot of units, maybe 200,000 on a good title,
619000	622000	and they only have a limited run.
622000	624000	They really cut their budget that way.
624000	628000	But I think that something like this, given the right marketing behind it,
628000	631000	and I'm sure there would be a lot of praise for it,
631000	633000	I think it would do pretty well.
633000	638000	And when you consider these games like Pets Cats 2 and Purrpals,
638000	641000	they have no marketing. They have zero marketing.
641000	646000	And all you're getting, people are seeing these in the stores,
646000	649000	and they're picking it up based on the cute kitten that's on the front cover.
649000	651000	That's it.
651000	654000	Because they're, oh, my daughter likes cat games, so they'll pick it up.
654000	659000	And if it's a quirky, weird cat game, it's cute, and it's got fun games in it.
659000	661000	I think it's even better.
661000	664000	Let's go to the chat room, our always present other guests here on the program,
664000	665000	chat.orangetonshooter.com.
665000	667000	Dark Tetsuya in chat asks,
667000	669000	yeah, who would we contact about localizing this, if anyone?
669000	672000	And this kind of, you know, leading into the next question,
672000	675000	what happens from here with our little mission to get this game localized?
675000	677000	I have a thought, but go ahead.
677000	683000	I would contact kind of the usual bunch of people that are out there
683000	685000	localizing weird-ass games.
685000	688000	I mean, there's a few companies out there that will do that.
688000	691000	One example would be UFO Interactive.
691000	696000	They localize a lot of shoot-em-up games, like shmup games,
696000	699000	bullet hell stuff, and a lot of other weird stuff,
699000	701000	plus they have their own games that they actually put out as well,
701000	704000	but they do a lot of localization in that sense,
704000	708000	and it's a lot of stuff that I know that their stuff is not selling that many units,
708000	711000	but I guess they're picking these properties cheap enough
711000	714000	or something that they decide, you know, that it's worth putting it out.
714000	720000	Like they put out, I forget if it was like Go Minion or something like that.
720000	723000	It ended up coming out as Domino Rally over here or something like that.
723000	725000	It's like Go Go Minion I think was the name of it.
725000	729000	You know, that's a really obscure title, but they went ahead and brought it over here.
729000	732000	Axis Game Localization does the same stuff.
732000	734000	They've been doing a little bit more mainstream stuff lately.
734000	737000	They've been doing the Guilty Gear series, a lot of stuff from that.
737000	739000	But there's a few other things that they bring over.
739000	741000	Then if you want to talk to other publishers,
741000	746000	there's Zoo Games that brings out a lot of like, you know, kind of bargain bin stuff.
746000	750000	They do a lot of localization for UK games that get released over there,
750000	754000	but they're willing to bring over properties that no one has any idea what the hell they are over here,
754000	760000	like Kokoto, which is some sort of demon character that's popular I guess in the UK or something.
760000	764000	So should our listeners that feel passionate about the game email these guys, tweet them?
764000	768000	No, I think it'd be a good idea to maybe bring it up to maybe,
768000	774000	I would go with like UFO Interactive and maybe Triaxis, maybe even like D3 or something,
774000	779000	because remember D3, they brought over Defense Force, which is sweet and weird.
779000	786000	Only Shambara, plus they have a simple series in Japan, so they're used to weird ass games,
786000	792000	but it's just, I don't know, it couldn't hurt to hit up more people than less.
792000	797000	In a way, I think our quirky little mission has succeeded big already.
797000	801000	I mean obviously this was just kind of like a running joke last week,
801000	805000	and I don't want to say it's a joke, because I mean there's a lot of truth to it.
805000	808000	Obviously it's something that kind of got like way bigger than we ever thought.
808000	812000	I mean with them responding and what have you, but in a way I think it already succeeded.
812000	817000	Having hit all the game blogs, having, I mean, let's face it, the developers' Twitter,
817000	822000	their numbers of followers has doubled, damn near tripled since everything happened last week.
822000	826000	You know, and I think in that regard, I think it already got the point across in regards to,
826000	829000	hey, there's an audience over here for this kind of like quirky stuff.
829000	833000	If you don't think game developers have already noticed when, you know,
833000	836000	several major, major gaming blogs picked up the story.
836000	841000	Yeah, and really what it came down to is what are these, what kind of units are they looking to sell?
841000	843000	What would make it worthwhile for them to bring it over here?
843000	845000	I mean obviously something like this is not going to sell a million units.
845000	848000	I mean it's not going to be, I don't think it's going to be the next Katamari.
848000	849000	I mean it's not.
849000	852000	They didn't think the Katamari was going to be the next Katamari.
852000	856000	Actually it's good you bring that up, but keep in mind Katamari Damacy was a big risk too.
856000	859000	That game was released for 20 bucks several years ago.
859000	863000	And it was weird, and everyone loved it because it was different.
863000	867000	I want to read this comment, and I don't know if you have anything else you want to say on this Dark Sakura,
867000	869000	but another comment from chat, Bochikawa in chat,
869000	873000	Skye, the best jokes are those that we all can relate to,
873000	876000	and I think you hit the nail on the head there.
876000	880000	Again, this is not the first game we've screamed from the mountain tops,
880000	882000	has ought to be localized and brought over here.
882000	886000	Keep in mind, this show started as a music game based show,
886000	890000	and we have screamed at the top of our lungs about tons and tons of music games
890000	891000	since the very beginning of this.
891000	896000	But for some reason, this one got people's attention.
896000	899000	And it's part the Twitter thing.
899000	901000	I think that speaks for me about Twitter.
901000	902000	It's part the Twitter thing.
902000	904000	But I think it's part the fact that people looked at this and went,
904000	906000	oh my God, this does look really cute.
906000	911000	Why isn't there like a lolcats game with this as big as, you know,
911000	913000	maybe that wasn't the point behind this game,
913000	915000	but that's what a lot of us are kind of interpreting it as,
915000	917000	is cats in funny situations, cat wearing cat masks,
917000	921000	and the whole like stealing money game I saw a video of with the cats,
921000	923000	and the cat driving the car.
923000	930000	It is ridiculous and preposterous like lolcats and fun, fun, fun.
930000	934000	I think that the best kind of fun is the ones you don't expect to be fun.
934000	935000	You know, the ones that surprise you.
935000	938000	I played the cat dodging game about ten times.
938000	939000	It's fun.
939000	941000	It's just ridiculous and weird.
941000	943000	And it's fun because there's like, you know,
943000	945000	you have to dodge a cat and then there's cats that will jump out
945000	946000	with like hearts above their heads.
946000	950000	You have to expand your arms out to catch the cat in a loving embrace.
950000	955000	And it does it in this really weird like slow motion cut scene with,
955000	957000	you know, like roses and all sorts of stuff.
957000	959000	It's weird, but it's funny.
959000	963000	I got to read this comment from actdeft in our chat room,
963000	965000	and who says that Twitter is useless?
965000	967000	I did two weeks ago.
967000	970000	I was actually listening to the show before last week's show,
970000	973000	and I had said I was done and fed up with Twitter,
973000	974000	and I didn't get the point.
974000	976000	Boy, did I get told.
976000	978000	Well, didn't I tell you, you know,
978000	981000	that I've done some of my best networking through Twitter.
981000	985000	And, you know, I've gotten a little bit of work through Twitter.
985000	988000	You know, it really is super useful.
988000	992000	And especially, you know, right now it greatly served our purpose.
992000	993000	You know.
993000	995000	What is our purpose?
995000	997000	Whatever we determine it is at the time.
997000	1002000	No, I think our purpose was to show that more Japanese developers
1002000	1004000	should think about bringing their quirky little games over here,
1004000	1005000	because there's an audience for it.
1005000	1006000	I mean, shoot.
1006000	1008000	Where was it that we would always go to at E3?
1008000	1010000	We would go to the small little developers,
1010000	1012000	to the ones that were looking.
1012000	1013000	Kensha Frickin' Hall.
1013000	1016000	Or the back corner where Natsume had their little walk around
1016000	1018000	thinking you could get, like,
1018000	1021000	my sheep is right over there, my Harvest Moon sheep.
1021000	1023000	You know.
1023000	1026000	And also I was thinking, you know,
1026000	1030000	Matt made some good suggestions,
1030000	1032000	but I think also look for that company,
1032000	1037000	see if they've released any other games that have been released in the US
1037000	1040000	and see who their marketer was.
1040000	1043000	But certainly, though, after the antics of last week,
1043000	1047000	you know in a boardroom somewhere in Japan this got brought up.
1047000	1049000	We're going to this crazy guy, Gene.
1049000	1051000	It's just very interesting.
1051000	1052000	I've got one more question for Loki,
1052000	1054000	and then we're going to get into how was your gaming week
1054000	1056000	and the way we usually start off the show.
1056000	1060000	Loki, what I'm really curious about, what did the wife think?
1060000	1062000	She thought it was weird.
1062000	1064000	I don't know.
1064000	1067000	She didn't really pay attention because I stopped playing it
1067000	1070000	because she got tired because I can't read any of the text,
1070000	1072000	and there's a lot of dialogue in the game.
1072000	1074000	And every time you progress the text forward,
1074000	1076000	it makes a bing sound.
1076000	1078000	So I was clicking, and it's all bing, bing, bing, bing, bing, bing.
1078000	1081000	She's like, stop that. That's annoying.
1081000	1083000	So that was pretty much...
1083000	1087000	For you to be developers when you localize this, a little less bing.
1087000	1089000	How about a cute meow noise instead of a bing?
1089000	1091000	Something I actually noticed from the screenshots
1091000	1094000	is that it's actually in very simple Japanese.
1094000	1096000	But part of the reason I was wondering
1096000	1099000	is how much of it was actually spoken dialogue
1099000	1101000	is because it would be much easier to follow if it's spoken.
1101000	1102000	There wasn't really any spoken.
1102000	1105000	There was a lot of meows and lots of text boxes.
1105000	1108000	What's also interesting, I've been looking on Twitter,
1108000	1110000	and quite a few people on Twitter have been talking about
1110000	1112000	how they got the game from Play Asia and so on.
1112000	1116000	So oddly enough, our little crusade ended up increasing the sales in Japan,
1116000	1117000	even if by a little bit.
1117000	1120000	So you're welcome for the free advertising.
1120000	1123000	I want someone to get the game for me.
1123000	1124000	All right.
1124000	1125000	I will render services.
1125000	1128000	Any other thoughts on President Cat for now?
1128000	1130000	I don't know if there's anything left to say.
1130000	1132000	In a way, I kind of think our mission was successful.
1132000	1135000	I don't know if there's a lot else that can be done.
1135000	1137000	Ultimately, it's out of our hands at this point,
1137000	1139000	and it is who's going to take a risk.
1139000	1140000	We can keep the awareness up.
1140000	1142000	I think we can keep the awareness up,
1142000	1144000	and we can alert the potential risk takers.
1144000	1146000	Keep that hashtag going.
1146000	1147000	Yeah, keep the hashtag going.
1147000	1149000	Tweet the companies that you think ought to bring it over,
1149000	1152000	and who knows what may happen.
1152000	1155000	Especially those of you that felt the need to email,
1155000	1156000	because I know this could act deft.
1156000	1158000	They'd thank at the bottom of the Joystick article,
1158000	1160000	so I know this came from tips from listeners,
1160000	1162000	these various game blogs around the story.
1162000	1166000	Now that we've got that, I guess,
1166000	1169000	start emailing some of the developers and see what happens.
1169000	1171000	I mean, the worst that happens, they're going to delete it.
1171000	1176000	Actually, I got their email address, the people over there.
1176000	1179000	I've just been trying to get a hold of one of my friends in Japan
1179000	1182000	to translate it for me, and she's been less than forthcoming
1182000	1185000	because she has a mutual friend is over there visiting,
1185000	1188000	so I might see if any of our Japanese listeners
1188000	1192000	who's really good with your translation let me know,
1192000	1197000	because I wanted to let them know exactly how we came across them.
1197000	1202000	So shoot an email at the mailbag, and we'll work together.
1202000	1207000	There may be some lucrative opportunity for you.
1207000	1210000	All right. Well, let's get back into our regular show here.
1210000	1213000	Obviously, we've taken a 20-minute detour to talk about President Cap,
1213000	1217000	but that kind of thing happens when we tend to get spotlighted for a week
1217000	1218000	for whatever reason.
1218000	1220000	We're going to move into our regular show now.
1220000	1222000	Our ego's full, and we turn into Big Divas.
1222000	1225000	Basically. Hey, wait a minute. What is this?
1225000	1229000	I asked for a Diet Coke. What is this? Anyway.
1229000	1234000	I'm sorry. I wanted 2% milk in my latte. Hi.
1234000	1235000	I peed in your latte.
1235000	1236000	You're a butt.
1236000	1238000	We're going to get into how was your gaming week.
1238000	1240000	We always like to start off the show with a little bit of that,
1240000	1243000	but let me quick just explain if anybody should be listening for the first time
1243000	1245000	because you heard about this through the President Cap stuff.
1245000	1247000	You know, we're three friends who've been doing this show
1247000	1249000	for about seven and a half years.
1249000	1251000	We all met in an arcade playing Dance Dance Revolution,
1251000	1254000	and we used to go to a little café right across the street
1254000	1257000	called Brookfield's after a night of arcade gaming,
1257000	1259000	and we'd just kind of sit around and talk smack about each other,
1259000	1262000	about video games, about whatever was going on in the world.
1262000	1264000	It was just basically nerds sitting around the dinner table,
1264000	1267000	and that's kind of the theme we like to emulate here,
1267000	1269000	and the way we invite you to the dinner table
1269000	1271000	is through all the ways to interact with our show,
1271000	1274000	chat.orangelandtrader.com, our Skype line, our mailbag, and so forth.
1274000	1275000	Twitter now, too.
1275000	1276000	I don't know you guys. Get out of my house.
1276000	1278000	Shut up. All right.
1278000	1281000	One way we like to always start off the show, though,
1281000	1283000	is with what we've been playing this week.
1283000	1285000	Dark Sakura, how have you had your gaming week?
1285000	1286000	How was your gaming week?
1286000	1287000	PEGGLE!
1287000	1289000	Lots and lots of PEGGLE.
1289000	1294000	My goal in PEGGLE has been to beat some of the levels on the first try,
1294000	1297000	and I beat that freaking hard DNA level on the first try,
1297000	1298000	and I was very proud of myself.
1298000	1301000	Like, one of the last ones with the spirals going up.
1301000	1307000	Anyway, I have also really not been playing much of anything else
1307000	1310000	just simply because I had my midterms last week
1310000	1317000	and migraines all last week and just the son of crap all week.
1317000	1320000	So I haven't really had too much of an opportunity,
1320000	1325000	although I'm still campaigning for, you know,
1325000	1328000	potential World of Warcrafting, maybe.
1328000	1330000	I just don't have time.
1330000	1332000	All right.
1332000	1334000	Loki, how was your gaming week?
1334000	1335000	It was pretty good.
1335000	1338000	I actually played, well, like I mentioned earlier,
1338000	1342000	President Cat, so I played a little bit of the new Renegame,
1342000	1344000	and it was fun.
1344000	1346000	I got through.
1346000	1348000	It starts off, it kind of breaks it up,
1348000	1350000	like there's three minigames that you have to do
1350000	1352000	and then like three more after that,
1352000	1354000	and I got past the first three minigames,
1354000	1358000	which is tough because the last one was like some question-answer thing.
1358000	1361000	I can't read any of that, so I just kept hitting random buttons,
1361000	1363000	and yet somehow I was getting it correct.
1363000	1365000	So I managed to get past that.
1365000	1367000	I played the piano portion,
1367000	1369000	even though I was hitting it in time.
1369000	1371000	I guess I wasn't doing it well enough,
1371000	1373000	and so they're getting pissed off.
1373000	1376000	And of course the car driving,
1376000	1380000	which is weird because you're like controlling the cat in the back of the car
1380000	1385000	that's sucking up what I look like stars or clouds or something.
1385000	1388000	It's just weird.
1388000	1393000	And then also play the cat dodging, which was kind of fun.
1393000	1396000	But yeah, the game is weird and fun.
1396000	1398000	So definitely worth checking out.
1398000	1401000	The other thing of course I played tons of was DJ Hero.
1401000	1405000	We just knocked out most of the songs in the game.
1405000	1408000	I think I've actually played through everything now.
1408000	1410000	Maybe a few tracks I'm missing,
1410000	1413000	but I've almost five-starred everything on Medium,
1413000	1416000	and I've started trying out some of the songs on Hard,
1416000	1421000	and it gets a lot harder, that's for sure.
1421000	1424000	But very fun game.
1424000	1428000	I hope everyone checks it out when it comes out in two days.
1428000	1431000	And then finally of course Grand Theft Auto IV
1431000	1433000	played some more Lost and Damned.
1433000	1437000	Also found a way around their patch to get rid of the mods,
1437000	1441000	but I haven't really done much with that because it's not working correct.
1441000	1445000	Because apparently if you've ever modded the Grand Theft Auto on PC,
1445000	1450000	if you change too much, it becomes unstable.
1450000	1455000	And then each save file actually saves some of the stuff that you change.
1455000	1457000	So if I try to change certain weapons or whatever,
1457000	1461000	they'll kind of disappear from the save, and it's a pain in the ass.
1461000	1464000	So I found a way around all that,
1464000	1467000	but unfortunately the modded discs I made was very unstable,
1467000	1469000	so I have to go back to the drawing board.
1469000	1472000	I don't really care though because the new expansion's coming out at the end of next week,
1472000	1474000	so I may just hold off on modding everything
1474000	1479000	until I can maybe get my hands on the episodes of Liberty City disc instead.
1479000	1482000	Because that might be a little more fun.
1482000	1484000	We were even just playing the new expansion,
1484000	1487000	because that's just going to be all sorts of awesome.
1487000	1492000	And other than that, I moved the arcade cabinet into the house this afternoon,
1492000	1495000	so I'm hopefully going to be done with that soon.
1495000	1501000	I'm downloading some front-end stuff for this program called Hyper Spin.
1501000	1503000	I'm going to be running on it.
1503000	1508000	So I've been downloading themes for a bunch of different games that I have in MAME.
1508000	1512000	And that's it.
1512000	1515000	I've been playing mostly World of Warcraft this week,
1515000	1517000	because I'm sucked into wowcrack.
1517000	1520000	But I did try out one new game.
1520000	1523000	I say game in quotes because it wasn't really a game,
1523000	1528000	but I checked out a game on PlayStation Network this week called Dot Detuned,
1528000	1531000	or just Detuned I guess you could call the game.
1531000	1534000	And it was something I think that was brought up at the very end of our show last week.
1534000	1536000	I want to say one of the callers alerted us to it.
1536000	1539000	I don't know if I saw it on Twitter during the week, but I saw it was $3.
1539000	1541000	And I was like, wow, what a deal for a game.
1541000	1543000	So I went ahead and downloaded it and checked it out.
1543000	1546000	And yeah, it wasn't quite what I was expecting,
1546000	1550000	because I heard that you could use custom soundtracks in the game,
1550000	1555000	and I finally figured out why my songs weren't copying over on my USB card to the PS3.
1555000	1558000	I had to go in there and do all or whatever, hit the triangle button.
1558000	1559000	I was finally able to figure it out.
1559000	1562000	So I got a bunch of custom songs on my PlayStation 3, so I was excited.
1562000	1567000	And I was like, oh, a game that uses custom soundtracks and it says it builds the game around the soundtracks.
1567000	1570000	I'm like, oh, cool, it's like a music game, like a beat matching game.
1570000	1574000	I love music games, that's what I'm all about, so let's check out this game.
1574000	1577000	Not exactly.
1577000	1581000	This is one of those games that's kind of like, I guess you could call it video game art.
1581000	1585000	And I know that's weird, because there's that whole controversy out there in the world,
1585000	1587000	are video games art?
1587000	1591000	But this is definitely one of those things where you kind of look at it and go,
1591000	1593000	well, it's not really a game either.
1593000	1595000	And PlayStation has a few of these.
1595000	1597000	I mean, PlayStation Network's kind of been the home for these.
1597000	1602000	But in a way, like Flower, that game on PlayStation Network was kind of art, too.
1602000	1605000	But there was a game there, and that was a really cool game.
1605000	1610000	Actually, I think Flower is one of the best, if not the best PlayStation Network title out there.
1610000	1612000	It's a beautiful game.
1612000	1616000	It's the strangest racing game you'll ever play in your life, but it's amazing.
1616000	1619000	So I thought, okay, I'll take a chance on this Detune game.
1619000	1621000	But it's really weird.
1621000	1624000	Like, you use buttons to pump the guy sitting in the chair.
1624000	1628000	And depending on what kind of skin you've selected with your direction buttons
1628000	1632000	and your triangle, square, X buttons might make it do different things.
1632000	1635000	Like, he might turn into an elephant man.
1635000	1638000	Or he might turn into a ghost-looking man.
1638000	1641000	And then as you wind the R-stick, he might dance around the chair
1641000	1643000	or do this weird thing in the chair.
1643000	1645000	And then if you hit another button, it deflates.
1645000	1648000	Basically, it's like playing with a baby toy.
1648000	1651000	You hit all these different buttons and it makes different noises
1651000	1652000	or has all these different effects.
1652000	1653000	It's very strange.
1653000	1655000	But I can't stress this enough.
1655000	1657000	There is no game here.
1657000	1659000	There is no object. There is nothing to do.
1659000	1661000	And yes, you can use your custom soundtracks.
1661000	1665000	And some of the pumps and little effects will distort the soundtrack.
1665000	1669000	This is literally one of those things that you sit there and you press the buttons
1669000	1671000	and it kind of does different things.
1671000	1674000	I imagine it's a lot more impactful if you're on drugs or something.
1674000	1677000	I'm not on drugs, so I didn't quite see that.
1677000	1681000	But yeah, it was just interesting.
1681000	1684000	I'm not saying it was bad because it was three dollars.
1684000	1686000	And it's certainly something different.
1686000	1688000	I'm just saying it's not a game.
1688000	1690000	So be careful.
1690000	1693000	And yet it awards trophies even though it's not a game.
1693000	1694000	And I will tell you this.
1694000	1697000	If you want the easiest trophies,
1697000	1701000	like easier than those achievements in the Avatar game on 360,
1701000	1703000	just pay the three bucks for this game.
1703000	1706000	And you can have a gold trophy, like three silvers and a handful of bronze.
1706000	1708000	A handful of bronze in seconds.
1708000	1711000	I didn't even look at what the trophies were.
1711000	1715000	And I had all but one of them unlocked in five minutes in the game.
1715000	1717000	It was incredibly simple.
1717000	1721000	But that's, of course, I wouldn't recommend downloading a game just for trophies.
1721000	1723000	But I know there's some people out there that are, you know,
1723000	1725000	E-peen whores and want to see that stuff.
1725000	1729000	Otherwise, this is kind of one of those things.
1729000	1731000	I don't know if you ever go to the Museum of Modern Art
1731000	1733000	and you see some things in there that are really, really cool.
1733000	1735000	Like Andy Warhol paintings.
1735000	1736000	Well, that's kind of neat.
1736000	1738000	You know, that Marilyn Monroe painting is kind of rad.
1738000	1741000	But then, like, you see that other piece on the wall that just looks like
1741000	1745000	someone threw a paint can against the canvas and called it art.
1745000	1746000	That's art!
1746000	1749000	Well, this is, okay, well, this is what that game,
1749000	1752000	this is the art equivalent of that.
1752000	1755000	This is the video game equivalent of that art piece.
1755000	1760000	You kind of look at it and go, okay, I guess there's art in here somewhere.
1760000	1765000	So, but you know what, it does add to the very interesting debate
1765000	1768000	that is, are video games art or not?
1768000	1770000	It's very, very strange.
1770000	1772000	So there you go.
1772000	1774000	And I'm going to link this in the chat room.
1774000	1776000	But look at this. Isn't that art?
1776000	1778000	I've seen that before.
1778000	1782000	But it's not what one would conventionally think of,
1782000	1784000	like a Renoir or anything.
1784000	1785000	I'll link it in the chat room.
1785000	1787000	Terrible radio trying to describe a painting.
1787000	1788000	There's lines and boxes.
1788000	1791000	All I need to tell anyone is that it's one of Mondrian's work.
1791000	1795000	You know, it's the primary colors, black and white on a grid,
1795000	1799000	but that's still art, even though it's not really representational of anything.
1799000	1802000	So, I mean, it all depends on what you enjoy.
1802000	1804000	And there's some people that are going to look at that and go,
1804000	1806000	what the fuck is that crap?
1806000	1808000	You know, somebody paid thousands of dollars for that?
1808000	1811000	So, and that would exactly be this game.
1811000	1813000	There's going to be some people that look at it and go, wow, this is art.
1813000	1814000	This is cool.
1814000	1820000	This is just like an interactive experience that you can only get on a video game console.
1820000	1823000	And there's some people that are going to look at it and go, what the fucking shit?
1823000	1824000	Are these people on drugs?
1824000	1827000	And keep in mind, there was the all audio game on Saturn where you get seeds.
1827000	1828000	Uh-huh.
1828000	1833000	And it's zero visual. It's all audio, the way you play the game.
1833000	1834000	Interesting.
1834000	1836000	And you grow seeds into plants.
1836000	1837000	Is that like Seaman?
1837000	1839000	No, seeds. Like, real.
1839000	1843000	It comes with a packet of seeds and you plant them.
1843000	1844000	All right.
1844000	1847000	Yeah. So, that's not the most bizarre thing ever.
1847000	1850000	Uh, going to the chat room, alpha-kinanagram is in caps.
1850000	1853000	It's not a game, da-da-da. I believe I said that.
1853000	1854000	It's not a game.
1854000	1858000	But keep in mind, they're selling it in the game section of the PlayStation Store.
1858000	1860000	So, just, you know, be forewarned.
1860000	1861000	It is not a game.
1861000	1865000	And it awards trophies like a game would do.
1865000	1868000	You know, games usually have objectives and there are objectives with the trophy.
1868000	1870000	But it's not a game. I'm just saying.
1870000	1872000	It's not a game.
1872000	1874000	I'm not saying it's bad.
1874000	1876000	It's just weird.
1876000	1877000	Different.
1877000	1879000	Art is interpretation.
1879000	1881000	I interpreted this as, huh?
1881000	1883000	Some people are going to interpret this as cool.
1883000	1886000	Some people are going to interpret this as, pfft.
1886000	1888000	Just, interpretation.
1888000	1889000	As caca.
1889000	1890000	Yes, exactly.
1890000	1893000	So, that pretty much does it for my gaming week.
1893000	1895000	We're going to get into some gaming news here shortly.
1895000	1896000	But first, some housekeeping.
1896000	1901000	Hey, if you're not already, follow us on Twitter at www.Twitter.com slash O-L-R.
1901000	1903000	And also on tonight's show.
1903000	1905000	We actually have a pretty full show tonight.
1905000	1909000	We're going to be interviewing later on in the show, in part B, our pal Seg.
1909000	1914000	He is putting on a big part of this OOM LOUD event that's going on in San Francisco.
1914000	1916000	It's a charity event for Child's Play.
1916000	1922000	And we think these kinds of things that are very creative and involve video games and, you know, raise money for good causes.
1922000	1930000	Things that give gamers a good name as opposed to, you know, kid shoots up neighbors, says he was inspired by Grand Theft Auto.
1930000	1935000	We love covering things like this that really offset the crap stuff that's in the media.
1935000	1936000	So, this is a great cause.
1936000	1938000	We hope our friends in the Bay Area will show up to this.
1938000	1940000	We're going to talk to Seg a little later in the show.
1940000	1941000	Talk about OOM LOUD.
1941000	1942000	I know I'm going.
1942000	1944000	I think Jamie's going to go because I'll give her a ride.
1944000	1945000	She said all she needed was a ride.
1945000	1947000	Loki will try to get to go.
1947000	1950000	If all of us can go, we could have a band.
1950000	1952000	Might be fun.
1952000	1955000	Loki, you might have to see if you can get away from the wife for a night.
1955000	1956000	I don't know.
1956000	1957000	We could call the band President Cat.
1957000	1958000	Come on.
1958000	1959000	You know you want to do it.
1959000	1961000	All right.
1961000	1964000	Anyhow, we'll get into that a little later on in Part B of our show.
1964000	1966000	But first, some gaming news.
1966000	1967000	Start us off tonight, Loki.
1967000	1968000	Yes.
1968000	1972000	Recently, Microsoft opened their first Microsoft store in Scottsdale, Arizona.
1972000	1978000	And, of course, one of the big things about the store, other than kind of being sort of a copy of an Apple store,
1978000	1986000	is that they have the ability to basically print their own Windows games.
1986000	1996000	And the way this is done is you actually order it from a kiosk and then give your name, I guess, to one of the representatives in the stores.
1996000	2001000	And then basically you wait a few minutes and you'll actually have the game with the label on the game printed,
2001000	2008000	the case and inserts as well as the manual all printed for you.
2008000	2020000	So it's kind of like that whole, I don't know, they have a kiosk out there that will print, or I guess it will make custom DVDs for you as well, like movies.
2020000	2031000	But this is kind of cool, actually, because you can't really knock it since games, like for PC at least, there's not really a used market for them.
2031000	2034000	At least not one that you would see in a GameStop or something like that.
2034000	2044000	So if you're looking for a case and stuff and they don't have to have inventory in the store, I mean, that's pretty awesome.
2044000	2051000	I'd be kind of curious to see if they could do something like this with Xbox Live arcade games or something. That'd be pretty cool.
2051000	2056000	Kind of different. I mean, haven't they talked about this, though, for like video rentals, though?
2056000	2063000	And I don't know how successful this was, but I think a while ago Blockbuster was talking about how video stores would sometimes run out of movies.
2063000	2067000	That they could actually print out movies that you want to rent right there on the spot.
2067000	2071000	Originally I thought that's what those Red Boss kiosks did, but I guess that's not really what they do.
2071000	2082000	Now they had something that they were going to work on where you would be able to basically, it would burn DVDs for you, and you would have to get the licensing through different companies for this.
2082000	2093000	And the people that were kind of participating in it were actually really small studios that didn't really have the money or whatever to sell stock and that kind of stuff.
2093000	2097000	Or even catalog items for some of the major studios and whatnot.
2097000	2104000	It was supposed to cut down their costs because they don't store all this catalog product that doesn't sell as fast.
2104000	2120000	I guess I get the idea of putting out of print or catalog games into this kind of system, but as far as new games go, isn't the whole reason to walk into a store and buy a video game as opposed to just going onto Steam or Direct-to-Drive or one of those companies online?
2120000	2127000	Isn't the whole point of having the box, having the manual and that kind of new game smell that comes when you open up the box?
2127000	2134000	They still get that. I mean, they get the manual and everything printed. It's just, you know, they won't get the big giant cardboard box that goes with it.
2134000	2136000	Which I guess saves trees, I don't know.
2136000	2142000	And, you know, I guess you could look at it that way, but it's neat, I guess.
2142000	2150000	You'll be able to get a disc and you won't have to worry about it being out of stock because they're just burning a game for you, so why not?
2150000	2159000	Of course, I kind of look at this and go, well, you know, it would be cool, I guess, if the kiosk or whatever is kind of like showing you a demo of the game so you can play the game and then order it on the spot.
2159000	2165000	But then again, you could kind of do the same thing with a lot of these online systems like Steam and so forth.
2165000	2168000	You play a demo of the game and if you like it, drop the money for the full version.
2168000	2174000	But I guess this might be cool for like parents going Christmas shopping, wanting to buy computer games for the kids.
2174000	2180000	You know, you could see what the game looks like on a monitor in front of you, kind of see if it's appropriate for kids or not.
2180000	2186000	Like if it's, you know, Lego that you're getting or if it's, you know, Demon Slayers from Hell with boobies or whatever.
2186000	2193000	You know, you don't want to get the kids, you can kind of see what it is in the kiosk before you actually buy it and then have it printed right there.
2193000	2196000	I guess that would be the target audience for this kind of thing?
2196000	2197000	I think so, yeah.
2197000	2198000	Question mark?
2198000	2199000	Yeah.
2199000	2204000	And some comments from our chatroom at chat.orangelaunchradio.com.
2204000	2208000	GameGuru says, besides, you can buy DVD cases and print out box art.
2208000	2210000	Yeah, but I don't know, it's not the same.
2210000	2213000	Like the homemade stuff just isn't the same to me.
2213000	2218000	It's not the same and they actually, you know, obviously since it's games for Windows stuff, they have this stuff licensed.
2218000	2222000	They have the actual manufacturers giving them the artwork for this.
2222000	2234000	They have probably the process to, I'm sure it's not just going to be like an inkjet printer printing out a piece of crappy, you know, artwork that's going to be on paper that looks like cheap, you know, crap that you would make at home.
2234000	2237000	But I think this is going to be a little bit better than that.
2237000	2247000	And I don't know, I mean, I'd be interested to see, there's a lot of people that reported on this and, you know, obviously a lot of people that visited the store.
2247000	2255000	So, how is the software that's, you know, burned off that? I mean, does it look good? Does it, you know, look cheap and knocked off?
2255000	2259000	I mean, is it something that you could probably do at home for a lot less or?
2259000	2264000	Haven't you ever bought a video game and then you came home and like you were just kind of opening and going through it?
2264000	2270000	And unfortunately a lot of console games, especially Nintendo ones, put a lot of crap in there like sign up for the club, sign up for the whatever.
2270000	2277000	But haven't you ever like, there's been some games where you pull out the manual and you're like, this is an epic manual.
2277000	2278000	And I'm kind of glad I bought the game.
2278000	2280000	Anything Working Designs did?
2280000	2286000	Yeah. I thought Demon's Souls, just speaking of a very recent game, had a pretty epic manual with it.
2286000	2288000	I'm sure there's a lot of games out there.
2288000	2292000	And it's just not the same thing as, you know, running it on the inkjet or looking at a PDF file.
2292000	2297000	I would like to see them at their store and I would like to see this in actually other stores.
2297000	2305000	I mean, and yeah, I know you can buy Microsoft points and stuff like that and go purchase your own Xbox Live Arcade games.
2305000	2310000	But I want actual cards for like each individual game, you know, or something that I could print up and say,
2310000	2316000	OK, I want to give the gift of like, and why I would never punish someone like this.
2316000	2322000	Give someone the gift of, say, the Warriors game that they put on Xbox Live Arcade, you know,
2322000	2328000	and have it actually print up with like, you know, a nice little logo and stuff like that and have the code redeem that game.
2328000	2330000	And only that game.
2330000	2332000	I think that would be kind of cool.
2332000	2338000	But, you know, obviously I know they're out to sell the points cards and stuff because in that way you buy a game
2338000	2344000	and you still have extra points left over and they get you to spend, you know, $20 and $50 instead of, say, $10 or $15.
2344000	2352000	So, OK, Jamie brought in an epic manual that came to her mind and it's for Sega Ages on the Sega Saturn and it's fancy.
2352000	2356000	It's got like raised print and like the foil writing for Sega Ages.
2356000	2358000	It was a working designs game.
2358000	2360000	It's pretty epic.
2360000	2361000	There you go.
2361000	2368000	So, I know, could we make cards for Yaris and get those printed and I can give those to like, it's like giving someone a fruitcake for Christmas?
2368000	2369000	Yeah, it's free.
2369000	2370000	That would be kind of funny.
2370000	2376000	But even like, you know, not necessarily that, but like custom 1600 point cards or something.
2376000	2378000	I guess you could do that if you had the time.
2378000	2388000	You know, just buy a bunch of them and pull them all off and transpose the, you know, the number over to whatever new card you make.
2388000	2389000	I don't know.
2389000	2396000	It's just a neat idea and, you know, it's a neat way to go, especially now since a lot of businesses are trying to go all digital.
2396000	2400000	So, I don't know. It's kind of cool.
2400000	2404000	Well, this is a game whose manual I'd be curious to see what it looks like.
2404000	2406000	It's a game called Choaniki.
2406000	2410000	It's the sequel, I guess, or the prequel Choaniki Zero.
2410000	2412000	There have been a ton of Choaniki games.
2412000	2413000	Yes, but there's a new one coming out.
2413000	2417000	It's coming out to the PSP in spring of 2010.
2417000	2421000	It is coming out also as a download title because that's where all the PSP titles are going now.
2421000	2426000	And, by the way, this is coming out here in the U.S.
2426000	2428000	This is being localized.
2428000	2431000	By whom is it being localized?
2431000	2434000	Some brave, brave soul.
2434000	2438000	To be honest, I think Ax-AK-Sis is the name of the company.
2438000	2440000	Ax-Sis Game Localization.
2440000	2443000	The company I was talking about that localizes obscure shit.
2443000	2445000	Hello, this would be a perfect candidate.
2445000	2449000	This would be a perfect candidate because, honestly, like seriously.
2449000	2451000	It was so funny to see, you know, going back.
2451000	2454000	I'm picking on Joystiq a little bit when they were kind enough to run our article first.
2454000	2455000	But I have to say this.
2455000	2459000	It was so funny to see that whole little like Debbie Downer paragraph at the end about,
2459000	2462000	well, it would be a shame to see them localize this and lose money on it.
2462000	2465000	And then like not even a day later, here's a story.
2465000	2469000	Choaniki Zero being localized for the U.S. as if there's an audience for this.
2469000	2474000	Because a lot of people look at this and go L-O-L-W-T-F because, yes, if you don't already know,
2474000	2483000	it's all about like muscle bound guys wearing thong and all this muscle man-tastic voyage, I believe,
2483000	2485000	that press relief Steven said about it.
2485000	2488000	I mean this is a ludicrous freaking game.
2488000	2493000	Yet it's getting localized and it's coming out of here.
2493000	2496000	And the SNES one came out in Virtual Console.
2496000	2498000	And don't get me wrong.
2498000	2502000	I'm all for this kind of like weird shit coming out and I might even like check it out.
2502000	2504000	Especially if there's a demo for me to play.
2504000	2506000	You know, it's something different.
2506000	2509000	It certainly stands out from the countless other shooters I've seen.
2509000	2512000	But it is a little weird.
2512000	2514000	But there's an audience for this.
2514000	2518000	So I just can't, it's funny to me that there's an audience for this.
2518000	2523000	Yet President Cat, you know, doesn't apparently have an audience over here.
2523000	2525000	And it's going to end up in bargain bins across America.
2525000	2528000	So it's just interesting.
2528000	2534000	So yeah, as Loki said, there's your perfect candidate company for someone to bring the kitty cat games over with.
2534000	2535000	We'll see.
2535000	2540000	Well, how about something that is no surprise to anybody?
2540000	2542000	What's that?
2542000	2548000	Microsoft has poo-pooed on any thoughts of having Blu-ray on Xbox 360.
2548000	2551000	Which we sort of knew.
2551000	2557000	But they were talking about, Microsoft was actually talking about Blu-ray accessories for the PC.
2557000	2559000	But not for the Xbox 360.
2559000	2563000	Yeah, I think some interview that some dude did with some website earlier this week.
2563000	2566000	Isn't that so professional? Some dude at some website.
2566000	2570000	It's pretty much the boss, Steve Ballmer, said uh-uh.
2570000	2576000	But a lot of people interpreted him to say that these Blu-ray, oh Blu-ray for Xbox 360, imminent.
2576000	2578000	I saw that all over Twitter that night.
2578000	2580000	Blu-rays coming to Xbox 360.
2580000	2583000	That was me rolling my eyes and going, no.
2583000	2584000	Yeah.
2584000	2587000	Why would Microsoft put out a Sony product especially?
2587000	2589000	And you know they kind of make a good point.
2589000	2594000	And it's funny enough because yet again, here's something we just talked about two weeks ago on the show or even last week.
2594000	2602000	I think before all that cat madness started, we were talking about how, you know, one thing that Sony has that Microsoft doesn't have is Blu-ray.
2602000	2607000	And if Microsoft was smart, they would be selling the streaming video, the Netflix.
2607000	2612000	And sure enough, when they kind of backpedaled on what the dude had said earlier in the week.
2612000	2619000	They said, hey, we're going to be the only system with streaming 1080p very soon.
2619000	2623000	So they're kind of saying, you don't need Blu-ray when you have streaming video.
2623000	2625000	Yeah.
2625000	2626000	I don't know.
2626000	2629000	I like the Netflix Instant Q stuff.
2629000	2635000	I like Netflix Instant Q, but at the same time, I'm very proud this week of one of my purchases.
2635000	2639000	I bought the box collection of the Star Trek Next Generation movies.
2639000	2642000	That's right, all four movies with Captain Picard and a bonus disc.
2642000	2643000	I'm very excited.
2643000	2644000	On Blu-ray.
2644000	2646000	And that's not something I would have wanted to download.
2646000	2647000	So you're bringing that over, right?
2647000	2648000	We could totally have a Nerdathon.
2648000	2649000	I am all over.
2649000	2651000	I actually haven't seen Insurrection.
2651000	2653000	What?
2653000	2654000	And I've got it on Laserdisc, I think.
2654000	2657000	Oh my gosh, we should totally have a Blu-ray Next Genathon.
2657000	2660000	No, I have first contact on Laserdisc.
2660000	2661000	Can we drink?
2661000	2662000	Sure.
2662000	2663000	Awesome.
2663000	2664000	We're going to have a nerdy slumber party.
2664000	2665000	I like Booz Mahal.
2665000	2666000	It'll be awesome.
2666000	2668000	Anyhow, I don't know how we got off topic.
2668000	2672000	But for me, it's kind of the same thing going back to the story we were talking about earlier
2672000	2674000	with the games being printed on demand.
2674000	2677000	I would not have downloaded the Star Trek collection.
2677000	2681000	And even though I could probably get a lot of these on Instant Netflix,
2681000	2688000	it's just not the same as having the collection in your house anytime you want, put in the disc.
2688000	2692000	Yeah, but it's easier for me to watch stuff on my computer.
2692000	2695000	Is it just me or Blu-rays seeming to get a little cheaper?
2695000	2697000	They're getting a little cheaper, not much.
2697000	2699000	You're finding used ones more often.
2699000	2701000	And I'm finding a lot of sales now.
2701000	2703000	I'm seeing a lot of Blu-rays.
2703000	2704000	I was at Best Buy this week.
2704000	2706000	One game I didn't talk about during my gaming week,
2706000	2708000	because we've talked about it at length the past couple weeks,
2708000	2710000	I finally played the DJ Hero demo.
2710000	2712000	Loki's had DJ Hero here the past couple weeks,
2712000	2715000	but he's always been the one playing it because he knows what he's doing.
2715000	2717000	I finally got my hands on it this week, and that was fun.
2717000	2719000	I was at Best Buy, and I was looking at Blu-rays.
2719000	2721000	They had a lot of Blu-rays available for $10, $15.
2721000	2725000	So they're starting to come the way of DVDs.
2725000	2726000	They're still a little more expensive than DVDs.
2726000	2728000	You can get DVDs for $4 at Walmart,
2728000	2733000	but they're coming down a little bit, which is nice.
2733000	2734000	All right.
2734000	2736000	Let's move on with some more gaming news.
2736000	2738000	We'll get to release dates very soon
2738000	2741000	and see if there's anything wacky coming out this week.
2741000	2742000	But first, some more news.
2742000	2747000	Yeah, and I don't know about another president, Kat.
2747000	2750000	Yeah, I'm all campaigned out.
2750000	2754000	So Xbox Live, the preview for the new fall update,
2754000	2758000	they have sent out their first Wave 1 invites.
2758000	2762000	In fact, actually, I got one of those, so I have the new update.
2762000	2765000	I haven't gotten a chance to play with a lot of the stuff on there,
2765000	2767000	but I did do the Twitter thing,
2767000	2772000	and the problem I see is I don't think I'm going to use half this stuff.
2772000	2777000	I mean, the Twitter and the Facebook stuff, it's neat.
2777000	2780000	Do you know how many tweets I saw this week that were,
2780000	2784000	hey, I'm posting from my 360? I'm just like, eye roll.
2784000	2786000	Like, we totally saw this coming.
2786000	2788000	Everybody's going to have to do that mandatory tweet.
2788000	2791000	Hey, guys, I got in the preview program.
2791000	2792000	Here's my tweet from the 360.
2792000	2795000	Hey, I want to tell you guys a secret.
2795000	2798000	Almost everybody who signs up for these preview programs gets in.
2798000	2799000	You know why?
2799000	2802000	Because it's Microsoft's little way now.
2802000	2804000	Do you remember when their system crashed a couple of years ago
2804000	2805000	when they rolled out one of these updates
2805000	2807000	because everybody was freaking downloading it at once?
2807000	2810000	This little preview program is their way of doing a rolling release
2810000	2812000	for these updates.
2812000	2814000	Except they're going to have to re-download it.
2814000	2815000	It's not the full thing.
2815000	2816000	Oh, really?
2816000	2817000	Yeah.
2817000	2818000	Interesting.
2818000	2820000	Because the music store isn't working yet.
2820000	2823000	Well, they have Lips on there, and that's it.
2823000	2827000	But yeah, so apparently a lot of people got in on it,
2827000	2830000	and they did have a lot of cool stuff in there.
2830000	2832000	Of course, if you're in the UK, you got to check out the Skyplayer
2832000	2834000	and that kind of thing.
2834000	2841000	Over here in North America, they had, of course, the Last.fm,
2841000	2842000	Facebook.
2842000	2843000	Did you check out the Last.fm by chance?
2843000	2844000	No, I haven't.
2844000	2846000	That's the one thing I am kind of curious about,
2846000	2847000	because I am a Last.fm user.
2847000	2850000	I prefer it to Pandora and the other services available out there.
2850000	2852000	I think they're great,
2852000	2854000	because the way it kind of syncs up with your iPod and everything
2854000	2856000	with the Scrobbler,
2856000	2859000	and the recommendations have been, for the most part, pretty good.
2859000	2863000	So I'm really curious to see what the Last.fm does,
2863000	2866000	if I can play them during my games or what.
2866000	2869000	Maybe somebody in chat who's in the preview program can clue me in.
2869000	2871000	It would be cool if you can,
2871000	2876000	because I've done a little bit of custom soundtrack stuff.
2876000	2878000	There's not a lot of games that use it quite right.
2878000	2880000	Like Grand Theft Auto, for example,
2880000	2882000	when you just play it, it just plays over everything,
2882000	2885000	and it's kind of annoying, because it doesn't just play
2885000	2887000	when you get in a car or something like that,
2887000	2889000	which is disappointing.
2889000	2891000	I don't know.
2891000	2892000	It's neat.
2892000	2895000	I'll probably get a chance to play with a little bit more of it this week.
2895000	2896000	I just kind of like,
2896000	2898000	oh, look, hey, it downloaded, and, you know,
2898000	2900000	oh, okay, try the tweet.
2900000	2901000	Okay, I'm going to bed.
2901000	2903000	You know, and that was it.
2903000	2905000	The chat room is confirming for me,
2905000	2907000	DJ Dark Knight and Golden Anthro both saying
2907000	2908000	you can't play them with your games.
2908000	2910000	Last.fm does not work with your game.
2910000	2912000	Okay, that's lame.
2912000	2914000	Well, I guess it's the kind of thing that might be
2914000	2916000	background noise at parties or something,
2916000	2918000	or, you know, I could just turn on the Xbox in my living room,
2918000	2920000	because I don't have a computer in my living room,
2920000	2922000	and let's say maybe I'm cleaning or something
2922000	2924000	and I want to listen to synth pop while I do it,
2924000	2926000	I could bring up Last.fm, type in synth pop,
2926000	2929000	run it on my 360, and clean my living room.
2929000	2931000	Actually, okay, we all know it would be Spice Girls,
2931000	2934000	but, you know, I'm saying, whatever you want.
2934000	2940000	Synth pop and Spice Girls mixed together would be epic.
2940000	2942000	Very epic.
2942000	2944000	And Tiger Claw also confirms that the music stops playing
2944000	2945000	when you exit out of it.
2945000	2947000	So it sounds like it's kind of like an independent application,
2947000	2949000	kind of like Netflix is, basically.
2949000	2951000	Like, the movies stop when you leave Netflix.
2951000	2953000	Like, all the programs are kind of like that, too,
2953000	2955000	like, you know, the Twitter and stuff,
2955000	2957000	it kind of goes into its own program thing,
2957000	2959000	and then you actually back out to the main menu
2959000	2961000	when you're done.
2961000	2963000	Whatever, I mean, if I really am that desperate
2963000	2965000	to check, you know, Twitter and stuff,
2965000	2967000	I guess that would be handy.
2967000	2969000	It might be useful, like, if I, whatever,
2969000	2971000	go on the road or something like that
2971000	2973000	and I have my Xbox 360 and I don't have, like,
2973000	2975000	you know, my laptop or something like that,
2975000	2977000	that might be important.
2977000	2979000	It might be about, you know, hey, you know,
2979000	2981000	where are you guys going to be at this time,
2981000	2983000	or something like that.
2983000	2985000	You know, assuming that I don't have their cell phone number
2985000	2987000	or something like that, because I would just use my cell phone.
2987000	2989000	But, um, it might be neat.
2989000	2991000	But then again, after all this stuff is in here and stuff,
2991000	2993000	I have to wonder,
2993000	2995000	why the hell is there not an internet browser yet?
2995000	2997000	That is very, very good question.
2997000	2999000	That is one thing that Xbox is, like,
2999000	3001000	sorely lacking, and these are the people
3001000	3003000	that make Internet Explorer.
3003000	3005000	Why?
3005000	3007000	Is there not, unless,
3007000	3009000	you know, because Internet Explorer is,
3009000	3011000	you know, kind of a magnet for bugs
3011000	3013000	and all sorts of exploits and whatnot
3013000	3015000	that they're worried that somehow they're going to
3015000	3017000	find a way around.
3017000	3019000	Oh, people playing, like, emulated games,
3019000	3021000	like, Nintendo games in a Flash browser
3021000	3023000	or something, you know?
3023000	3025000	Is that what they're worried about, maybe?
3025000	3027000	Maybe. But I would think, though, with maybe Facebook
3027000	3029000	or something, you might be able to kind of exploit something, too.
3029000	3031000	You know, I never even thought to do that on the Playstation,
3031000	3033000	because the Playstation has a decent web browser.
3033000	3035000	But is it just me, or
3035000	3037000	are both the Playstation and the Wii
3037000	3039000	their web browsers? It's kind of clunky.
3039000	3041000	Like, they just don't work like it does on a computer.
3041000	3043000	And, I don't know,
3043000	3045000	especially when I'm using, like, the YouTube TV site,
3045000	3047000	like, they're so slow to load.
3047000	3049000	That's been the hang-up
3049000	3051000	of any type of web system
3051000	3053000	on a console.
3053000	3055000	I mean, really. You think, I mean,
3055000	3057000	but isn't the PS3 supposed to be a computer?
3057000	3059000	So they said, I think they did it
3059000	3061000	just for the tax cut, remember?
3061000	3063000	I guess. I don't know, they seem
3063000	3065000	a little clunky to me, because I love doing,
3065000	3067000	like, you know, you guys have been to my house,
3067000	3069000	and, you know, like, when I have a lot of
3069000	3071000	people over, we'll fire up YouTube
3071000	3073000	and watch funny things, and it's really good
3073000	3075000	to be able to do it on the Wii or the Playstation 3.
3075000	3077000	You know, I love that new YouTube channel,
3077000	3079000	but it's slow and clunky.
3079000	3081000	You know what I say, if you want to run anything off the internet
3081000	3083000	on your TV, build a multimedia
3083000	3085000	box.
3085000	3087000	I guess, but... Especially now with an HDTV,
3087000	3089000	it's so
3089000	3091000	cheap and
3091000	3093000	easy to do.
3093000	3095000	DJ Dark Knight does say in chat,
3095000	3097000	I do like how on Last.fm they do have
3097000	3099000	video game music stations. I wasn't aware of that.
3099000	3101000	That's kinda interesting.
3101000	3103000	So I'm gonna have to check this out. You know I'm going on, like,
3103000	3105000	60 days since I've played on Xbox 360.
3105000	3107000	I'm like, I've been all Playstation 3
3107000	3109000	lately, so...
3109000	3111000	Very interesting. Anyhow,
3111000	3113000	speaking of Playstation 3, I signed into home,
3113000	3115000	and there were, like, six requests to join our club,
3115000	3117000	so I approved them all, so if you want to join the
3117000	3119000	Sony home club
3119000	3121000	for Orange Lounge Radio, look for us on the
3121000	3123000	search and at us
3123000	3125000	before we fill up.
3125000	3127000	Moving on to another game
3127000	3129000	story about Fable 3.
3129000	3131000	Fable 3, a couple of things
3131000	3133000	about this. There will be an in-game
3133000	3135000	shop with microtransactions
3135000	3137000	in Fable 3. I'm sure this is
3137000	3139000	no surprise at all.
3139000	3141000	But what they're doing, they're kind of integrating this
3141000	3143000	in-game shop in the game world,
3143000	3145000	and you buy the download content in
3145000	3147000	this shop with the experience.
3147000	3149000	In other words,
3149000	3151000	you don't pop up a new screen that takes
3151000	3153000	you to the Xbox Live Marketplace.
3153000	3155000	In my mind, this is kind of similar to what Rock Band 2
3155000	3157000	did a little while ago. That's kind of
3157000	3159000	very integrated into the game, but of course
3159000	3161000	Rock Band's a very different type of game than
3161000	3163000	Fable 3, so it'll be interesting.
3163000	3165000	And they are saying
3165000	3167000	that possibly one idea
3167000	3169000	is that special weapons could sell
3169000	3171000	for $1.70.
3171000	3173000	This is starting to tread into dangerous
3173000	3175000	territory, though. I don't like the idea
3175000	3177000	that I could spend real money
3177000	3179000	at the touch of a button for
3179000	3181000	weapon upgrades.
3181000	3183000	I mean, this is starting to get a little cheap.
3183000	3185000	That's getting silly.
3185000	3187000	I'm sorry, here's my problem with it.
3187000	3189000	It's Fable 3, and I'm sorry.
3189000	3191000	Luckily for me,
3191000	3193000	I didn't play Fable 1. I played
3193000	3195000	Fable 2, and I learned my lesson
3195000	3197000	not to trust Peter Molyneaux for
3197000	3199000	crap, and I don't get it
3199000	3201000	because I really enjoyed Fable 2.
3201000	3203000	It was one of my favorite games that year it came out.
3203000	3205000	No, I got bored with it really fast.
3205000	3207000	That's where we have differing opinions
3207000	3209000	on Long Long Radio. Exactly, and Fable 3
3209000	3211000	I'm sorry, they're going to start doing this in the
3211000	3213000	tall stuff. They're going to have this
3213000	3215000	store in there, and yeah, I know I don't have to buy any
3215000	3217000	of this stuff, but
3217000	3219000	I'm just going to bypass the whole game altogether.
3219000	3221000	Unless there's something that's really
3221000	3223000	awesome that I must play in this.
3223000	3225000	I mean, I
3225000	3227000	guess it's where we're going to be going
3227000	3229000	with it. I mean, so...
3229000	3231000	It's the trend that's showing
3231000	3233000	up that I'm getting really nervous about.
3233000	3235000	But the bottom line is, if you don't like it, don't buy it.
3235000	3237000	Show them that you're not going to support it.
3237000	3239000	That's really what it boils down to in the end.
3239000	3241000	But it's just kind of sad that it's going there in the
3241000	3243000	first place. I'm still going to buy Fable 3. I loved
3243000	3245000	Fable 2, and the first Fable was good too.
3245000	3247000	You know, no matter what, I'm going to buy it,
3247000	3249000	but
3249000	3251000	this is a little ridiculous.
3251000	3253000	I'll just get my upgrades naturally. I know, I don't
3253000	3255000	like it for these
3255000	3257000	super great weapons
3257000	3259000	that you can, you know,
3259000	3261000	that are better than the ones you
3261000	3263000	get in the game normally. Like, if World of Warcraft
3263000	3265000	ever did this, this is what I'm really worried about,
3265000	3267000	is MMOs going this route where World of Warcraft
3267000	3269000	sells the Uber weapon.
3269000	3271000	Like, that'll be the day I leave World of Warcraft.
3271000	3273000	Because that's kind of bold that somebody would be able
3273000	3275000	to pay money and get the weapon.
3275000	3277000	Yeah, I agree. You know, although I
3277000	3279000	suppose one could argue they can do that now
3279000	3281000	and pay a gold farmer to buy the
3281000	3283000	crafted stuff, but... By the way,
3283000	3285000	something that didn't make our show this week, but I want to say
3285000	3287000	it really quick, because I want to applaud Blizzard,
3287000	3289000	finally kind of did a little campaign
3289000	3291000	against gold sellers this week, and basically
3291000	3293000	coming out and saying, look, if you support gold selling,
3293000	3295000	you are supporting the hacking of people's
3295000	3297000	accounts. You know, you're supporting all this stuff.
3297000	3299000	Did I even talk about on this show
3299000	3301000	that my WoW account was hacked a couple weeks ago?
3301000	3303000	Did I? Okay. And it sucks.
3303000	3305000	It totally sucks when something like that happens.
3305000	3307000	So, I totally agree with their stance.
3307000	3309000	If you buy gold online, you suck.
3309000	3311000	Because you're supporting
3311000	3313000	this practice of
3313000	3315000	hacking accounts like mine, and supporting
3315000	3317000	keyloggers and funding this,
3317000	3319000	basically. So, don't buy gold
3319000	3321000	online.
3321000	3323000	One other thing I wanted to state, although
3323000	3325000	Matt kind of stated it. It was circulated also
3325000	3327000	this week. Project Natal will be
3327000	3329000	supported in Fable 3. That, of course, should come
3329000	3331000	as no surprise at all, since
3331000	3333000	Peter Molyneux was, of course, out there
3333000	3335000	at E3 this year, kind of,
3335000	3337000	you know, promoting Project
3337000	3339000	Natal, but there will be support for it in Fable 3.
3339000	3341000	What will it do?
3341000	3343000	I don't know.
3343000	3345000	Wait until the game comes out.
3345000	3347000	That's what it does.
3347000	3349000	I don't know.
3349000	3351000	Well, you know, there's something else going on
3351000	3353000	that's, I think, a little stinky.
3353000	3355000	Very much like the weapon upgrade business.
3355000	3357000	And that's, um,
3357000	3359000	there's a game that's called
3359000	3361000	Parachute Panic that's on
3361000	3363000	iPhone and iPod Touch.
3363000	3365000	And, achoo!
3365000	3367000	And achoo! And I'm allergic to it.
3367000	3369000	Um, actually, there's dust in the room.
3369000	3371000	Um, but now you, um,
3371000	3373000	on the last version that came out,
3373000	3375000	you can pay 99 cents to unlock
3375000	3377000	another five lives.
3377000	3379000	And it's a 99 cent game already.
3379000	3381000	So, I mean,
3381000	3383000	you can just
3383000	3385000	do it in-game, but for the impatient
3385000	3387000	people who want more lives, then
3387000	3389000	you just pay for it. I think it's kind of stupid.
3389000	3391000	And,
3391000	3393000	this is, again,
3393000	3395000	this kind of goes right in line with the Fable 3 story.
3395000	3397000	You know, it's paying for
3397000	3399000	something that,
3399000	3401000	kind of a cheap upgrade
3401000	3403000	in the game, I guess. But,
3403000	3405000	if you don't like it, don't buy it.
3405000	3407000	It's a crappy precedent to be setting.
3407000	3409000	Because, unfortunately,
3409000	3411000	if one person buys it,
3411000	3413000	they're like, hey, that's a dollar I didn't have before
3413000	3415000	to sell something like this.
3415000	3417000	No, I agree. I think it's really just
3417000	3419000	encouraging gamer laziness,
3419000	3421000	really.
3421000	3423000	It's kind of like EA and their cheat codes, remember?
3423000	3425000	Stuff that normally would be in a game for free.
3425000	3427000	You can sell it for two bucks.
3427000	3429000	Win-win.
3429000	3431000	I'm not,
3431000	3433000	I don't have as much of a problem with it
3433000	3435000	if it's something that you can achieve in the game
3435000	3437000	otherwise, especially single player.
3437000	3439000	Keep in mind when I ranted about, wow,
3439000	3441000	that's a multiplayer experience,
3441000	3443000	and much different. But a single player
3443000	3445000	game, you know what, if you want to use
3445000	3447000	cheats to your heart's content
3447000	3449000	in a single player game, where you're not
3449000	3451000	interacting with other people going online or what have you,
3451000	3453000	go for it. And if you want to pay two bucks
3453000	3455000	because you're too lazy to get it yourself, fine.
3455000	3457000	But as long as the option
3457000	3459000	is there for you to still get it yourself
3459000	3461000	and work towards it, I think it's okay.
3461000	3463000	It's just not something I would probably do.
3463000	3465000	I think it's more fun if you,
3465000	3467000	you know, I think anything worth having is worth
3467000	3469000	working for. Even if
3469000	3471000	it's in a game or not.
3471000	3473000	I am behind on some chat room
3473000	3475000	comments, so I want to read some comments from our chat room.
3475000	3477000	chat.orangelaungeradio.com
3477000	3479000	Salacious Pop says,
3479000	3481000	it could just be rose colored glasses
3481000	3483000	but Dreamcast's browser was pretty good.
3483000	3485000	Kind of going back a ways back.
3485000	3487000	Actually, yeah, it was decent. For the time.
3487000	3489000	You know, you have to kind of say, okay, well,
3489000	3491000	you know, that was 1999, this is
3491000	3493000	before kind of web browsers were
3493000	3495000	standard like that. What did Dreamcast browser
3495000	3497000	have to compete with? Web TV?
3497000	3499000	Yeah. So yeah, I think for its time,
3499000	3501000	it was certainly pretty good.
3501000	3503000	Let's see, Reddertainment says, the store
3503000	3505000	in Fable 3 will be good, but the store in Fable 4
3505000	3507000	will be awesome.
3507000	3509000	Let's hope that it's not more of this
3509000	3511000	technical and diming stuff, but I'm sure it will be.
3511000	3513000	Also a question from
3513000	3515000	Reddertainment, if Natal gets delayed,
3515000	3517000	will Fable 3 get delayed?
3517000	3519000	And Seg replies with his thought,
3519000	3521000	maybe not, unless Microsoft wants it as a
3521000	3523000	launch product. I assume Fable 3 is an
3523000	3525000	add-on support for Natal rather than a
3525000	3527000	requirement. So I guess, yeah,
3527000	3529000	that's a good thought. It depends on how much Natal
3529000	3531000	is integrated into this game. If it's like
3531000	3533000	a required part of the game, then
3533000	3535000	yeah, Natal delay is going to affect the game,
3535000	3537000	but if it's just kind of a
3537000	3539000	bonus little game or a bonus
3539000	3541000	little quest, then maybe not.
3541000	3543000	I could see that kind of being the case, is that
3543000	3545000	there's a download expansion that uses Natal
3545000	3547000	or something like that. It'll be kind of
3547000	3549000	interesting, I suppose.
3549000	3551000	So, alright.
3551000	3553000	Well, moving right along
3553000	3555000	into some release dates. Loki,
3555000	3557000	take us through the US releases this week.
3557000	3559000	Yeah, lots of good stuff this week. Of course,
3559000	3561000	we were talking about DJ Hero
3561000	3563000	earlier, and
3563000	3565000	that will be making its way out this week
3565000	3567000	on all four systems, and of course, the
3567000	3569000	Renegade Edition coming out on
3569000	3571000	the PlayStation 3, Xbox 360,
3571000	3573000	and the Wii. Also,
3573000	3575000	coming out this week, we've got
3575000	3577000	Tekken 6 on PlayStation
3577000	3579000	3 and Xbox 360,
3579000	3581000	as well as the Fight Stick bundles for those.
3581000	3583000	Hasbro Family

3593000	3595000	or Square on DS, Xbox
3595000	3597000	360, and the Wii.
3597000	3599000	We've also got...
3601000	3603000	probably not from any of our listeners,
3603000	3605000	but Nihau, Kylan,
3605000	3607000	Super Game Day on the Wii
3607000	3609000	for your Nick Jr. fans.
3609000	3611000	You read a lot of game releases that
3611000	3613000	I don't think a single one of OLR listeners
3613000	3615000	care about. Hey, they may have kids that watch Nick Jr.
3615000	3617000	and that is important. Just saying.
3617000	3619000	Just saying. Also, the Backyard
3619000	3621000	Again is another Nick Jr. program.
3621000	3623000	Nerf
3623000	3625000	N-Strike Elite
3625000	3627000	with the scope
3627000	3629000	that's going to be coming out in a bundle for the Wii.
3629000	3631000	Borderlands on PC
3631000	3633000	also making its way out this week.
3633000	3635000	RE Smarter than a Fifth Grader Game Time

3639000	3641000	Pets, Dolphins,
3641000	3643000	and Counters on the DS.
3643000	3645000	Once again, another game series that puts
3645000	3647000	out tons of games and I'm sure they don't
3647000	3649000	sell very well, but hey, you know what?
3649000	3651000	They're putting them out and people pick them up.
3651000	3653000	Barbie and the
3653000	3655000	Three Musketeers on DS and Wii.
3655000	3657000	Monster
3657000	3659000	4x4 Stunt Racer
3659000	3661000	with a pack-in wheel
3661000	3663000	coming to the Wii.
3663000	3665000	Drawn to Life, the next chapter, also on Wii
3665000	3667000	and DS this time.
3667000	3669000	Diner Dash Flow on the Go
3669000	3671000	is still the best title for the DS
3671000	3673000	title. Wow.
3673000	3675000	I know.
3675000	3677000	I was just here going, uh...
3677000	3679000	Some ladies might have to make a dash out of the diner
3679000	3681000	with Flow on the Go.
3681000	3683000	No one wants Flow on the Go.
3683000	3685000	That's always a bad thing.
3685000	3687000	Ben 10, Alien Force, Vilgax Attacks
3687000	3689000	on Playstation 2, Wii, and
3689000	3691000	DS and PSP.
3691000	3693000	Forza
3693000	3695000	Motorsport 3 on
3695000	3697000	Xbox 360.
3697000	3699000	CSI Deadly Intent on
3699000	3701000	DS and Wii.
3701000	3703000	I think PS3 and Xbox 360 as well.
3703000	3705000	This one's for Rob.
3705000	3707000	Press Your Luck 2010
3707000	3709000	coming out on PC, Wii, and
3709000	3711000	I believe
3711000	3713000	DS as well.
3713000	3715000	But if it's not Peter Tamarkin, then I don't give a crap
3715000	3717000	and I don't see how that'll be possible because he's
3717000	3719000	kinda dead.
3719000	3721000	What's his name?
3721000	3723000	Todd Newton. Can't stand him.
3723000	3725000	He's like the worst game show host ever.
3725000	3727000	Reanimation. Ruined Whammy.
3727000	3729000	And going back to the roots of this show, Dance Dance Revolution
3729000	3731000	Hot Party 3 making its way out
3731000	3733000	from Konami. Of course, all these
3733000	3735000	games now kinda blend together because they all
3735000	3737000	kinda suck.
3737000	3739000	I believe also
3739000	3741000	kinda go with that. DDRX2
3741000	3743000	will be coming out as well in the bundle
3743000	3745000	on Playstation 2. They only sell these
3745000	3747000	games in a bundle now because they want you to buy those
3747000	3749000	crappy dance pads to go with them.
3749000	3751000	And Hamster
3751000	3753000	or Pets Hamster's Bunch
3753000	3755000	on PSP because god forbid
3755000	3757000	if the PSP be devoid of
3757000	3759000	crappy pet games.
3759000	3761000	And
3761000	3763000	Dream Salon on DS.
3763000	3765000	Now that's gonna be crap.
3765000	3767000	And finally, stuff coming out a week
3767000	3769000	from now.
3771000	3773000	Rabbids Go Home would be
3773000	3775000	the last. Oh, Ratchet and Clank
3775000	3777000	Crack in Time. That's another title that'll be coming out
3777000	3779000	this week as well. I gotta read some comments
3779000	3781000	from chat. If you're done. I'm done.
3781000	3783000	Dart Tetsuya says, Sky, three words.
3783000	3785000	Zombie Peter Tamarkin.
3785000	3787000	Awesome.
3787000	3789000	Let's see, what else was said here? Oh, Salacious
3789000	3791000	Pop says, I'd play a Nick Jr.
3791000	3793000	Eureka's Castle FPS.
3793000	3795000	Hell yeah.
3795000	3797000	Where are the, yeah, exactly, where are the
3797000	3799000	Nickelodeon games for me?
3799000	3801000	Screw the children.
3801000	3803000	I want my Nickelodeon games.
3803000	3805000	Like, for instance, can I get like a
3805000	3807000	you can't do that on television minigame collection?
3807000	3809000	Or like,
3809000	3811000	Hey dude. Hey dude, explore the ranch
3811000	3813000	game. Or
3813000	3815000	Salute your shorts. Salute your shorts.
3815000	3817000	You know, are you afraid of the dark?
3817000	3819000	The best episode of Salute your shorts
3819000	3821000	had to have been was at the
3821000	3823000	water balloon capture the flag
3823000	3825000	episode. My favorite.
3825000	3827000	Thank you, Seg.
3827000	3829000	Legends of the Hidden Temple.
3829000	3831000	Guts. Actually, they did have a Guts game
3831000	3833000	on Super Nintendo, didn't they? Nick Arcade.
3833000	3835000	Yeah, I know. How about reviving one of these
3835000	3837000	old, like, classic frickin'
3837000	3839000	for all I care, do a fucking
3839000	3841000	today's special video game. I don't care.
3841000	3843000	Just give me something I remember from my childhood.
3843000	3845000	David the Gnome.
3845000	3847000	The Gnome was great. Turkey Television.
3847000	3849000	Tell me
3849000	3851000	you wouldn't play a Turkey Television, like, shooting
3851000	3853000	game. It'd be amazing.
3853000	3855000	Well, they do have Chicken Shoot. That's kinda close.
3855000	3857000	I guess so.
3857000	3859000	Alright, let's go to Japanese release dates.
3859000	3861000	Is there anything that's gonna make us go
3861000	3863000	crazy this week? Probably
3863000	3865000	not, because Japan's getting a lot of the titles that are
3865000	3867000	big and expected for us over here
3867000	3869000	this week. And Japanese releases this week on the
3869000	3871000	Xbox 360. Bayonetta makes its way
3871000	3873000	to the Xbox 360
3873000	3875000	on October 29th, as well as Tekken 6.
3875000	3877000	Of course, it's a big deal over there, just
3877000	3879000	as it is over here. Those both coming out to
3879000	3881000	the Xbox 360. And, of course, just in time
3881000	3883000	for Tekken 6, another hoary
3883000	3885000	arcade stick with the Tekken 6 design on it.
3885000	3887000	If you'd care to import one
3887000	3889000	of those from Japan. Or you can just get them here
3889000	3891000	in the bundle. Fine. Or on
3891000	3893000	the PlayStation 3, you could get a Bayonetta
3893000	3895000	there, or the, again, Tekken
3895000	3897000	6. There's also a game getting a price
3897000	3899000	reduction. That's Samurai Dou 3
3899000	3901000	Plus getting a price reduction this week.
3901000	3903000	So those are the big releases on the
3903000	3905000	360 PS3 combo.
3905000	3907000	Now, dipping into Nintendo Wii, we have some
3907000	3909000	different alternate titles. Another Dragon
3909000	3911000	Ball title. I'm sorry, that's
3911000	3913000	a US date. Chin Sports makes its
3913000	3915000	way to Japan. This is kind of
3915000	3917000	a mini-game collection that's wacky and weird
3917000	3919000	sports. This is the one that has
3919000	3921000	the Extreme Ironing. I think we talked
3921000	3923000	about this on the show. Oh, Wacky World of Sports? Yeah, remember we talked about, I think
3923000	3925000	this came up on the show a few weeks ago. It came out last month.
3925000	3927000	Yeah, for here in the US.
3927000	3929000	The Japanese are getting their own version
3929000	3931000	of that. Probably what people
3931000	3933000	care a little more about would be Sin and Punishment 2.
3933000	3935000	That is finally being released on the Nintendo Wii
3935000	3937000	this week. Super Robot
3937000	3939000	Taisen Nioh comes out as well, because there
3939000	3941000	just wasn't enough Super Robot
3941000	3943000	Taisen games. So another one is coming
3943000	3945000	out on the Wii this week. Heading on over to
3945000	3947000	the DS and looking at some of the games coming out
3947000	3949000	there on the DS,
3949000	3951000	we have Hakari No. 4 Senshi
3951000	3953000	Final Fantasy Gaiden comes
3953000	3955000	out on the DS. So yes, this is from
3955000	3957000	Squeenix. It's that Final Fantasy
3957000	3959000	DS title that doesn't look very
3959000	3961000	Final Fantasy to me at all. It's kind of like
3961000	3963000	a spin-off game. In this game, you try
3963000	3965000	to defeat the Witch of the North. That's what a Gaiden is
3965000	3967000	as a side story. Yeah, and it's
3967000	3969000	that same style of like Final Fantasy
3969000	3971000	3 DS and the Final Fantasy 12
3971000	3973000	spin-off game, but don't expect
3973000	3975000	it to play like
3975000	3977000	your other Final Fantasy games. It's a little bit
3977000	3979000	different.
3979000	3981000	You know what I miss as far as Final Fantasy
3981000	3983000	spin-off games go? You know what my favorite,
3983000	3985000	like seriously, my favorite Final Fantasy
3985000	3987000	spin-off game was? Tease me all you want.
3987000	3989000	I fucking love Chocobo Racing.
3989000	3991000	That game is amazing. No, I know
3991000	3993000	a lot of people who love that one. I wish they would make another
3993000	3995000	one. I love that game.
3995000	3997000	It was perfect for the Wii.
3997000	3999000	Or give me my extreme
3999000	4001000	Chocobo Racing on the PlayStation 3
4001000	4003000	just in time for Final Fantasy 13.
4003000	4005000	You know, you reminded me, I forgot two major
4005000	4007000	titles and I don't understand how I did that.
4007000	4009000	Fairy Tail Fights is coming out on Xbox 360
4009000	4011000	and PlayStation 3. Dude, how
4011000	4013000	did I forget this? Grand Theft Auto Episodes of
4013000	4015000	Liberty City on Xbox 360
4015000	4017000	this week. Fail. Cause I think most people think
4017000	4019000	of that as a download title.
4019000	4021000	It's still gonna be awesome.
4021000	4023000	Fairy Tail Fighters, is that what it
4023000	4025000	sounds like? No, Fairy Tail Fights. Think of it
4025000	4027000	as like, um,
4027000	4029000	Castle Crashers but with Fairy Tail characters.
4029000	4031000	It's brutal. It's like
4031000	4033000	blood and guts everywhere. Oh, you talked about this on a
4033000	4035000	previous show. This sounded awesome.
4035000	4037000	I'm gonna have to check that out. Is it
4037000	4039000	cheap or is it like 60 bucks? I think it's
4039000	4041000	like 50. I'll wait
4041000	4043000	for the bargain bin cause that's...
4043000	4045000	You wanna talk about a game that'll end up in the bargain bin?
4045000	4047000	Let's see. We can't really sell
4047000	4049000	this game to children and adults
4049000	4051000	probably won't take it very seriously either.
4051000	4053000	Uh, we could market this to the people
4053000	4055000	that bought the Red Riding Hood Zombie game
4055000	4057000	on the DS. That's probably
4057000	4059000	the target market for this.
4059000	4061000	It's gotta be the same company, right?
4061000	4063000	Nope. Right? That was Zoo
4063000	4065000	Games. It did, um,
4065000	4067000	Red Riding Hood
4067000	4069000	Zombie BBQ. Yeah,
4069000	4071000	that was it. That was the best name ever, by the way. That was an awesome game.
4071000	4073000	I played it at PAX, I think. It was either PAX
4073000	4075000	or E3. Uh,
4075000	4077000	it was PAX.
4077000	4079000	Um,
4079000	4081000	and SalaciousPop reminded me
4081000	4083000	in chat there saying I only got maybe
4083000	4085000	seven to eight hours in the Tactics titles.
4085000	4087000	I suppose Final Fantasy Tactics is a pretty notable
4087000	4089000	spinoff of the Final Fantasy series. Yeah.
4089000	4091000	But you know what's sad? I probably spent
4091000	4093000	more time playing Chocobo Racing than the Final
4093000	4095000	Fantasy Tactics games.
4095000	4097000	That's for sure. Uh,
4097000	4099000	specifically I wanted to mention on the PSP just because
4099000	4101000	I think this name is hilarious. It's
4101000	4103000	R-Type Tactics 2. Yes,
4103000	4105000	the R-Type Tactical game, remember that,
4105000	4107000	is actually getting a sequel. And the
4107000	4109000	sequel is called Operation
4109000	4111000	Bitter Chocolate.
4111000	4113000	I can't make that up. That is the real name of the game.
4113000	4115000	Operation Bitter Chocolate.
4115000	4117000	So would that be Dark Chocolate? Baker's Chocolate?
4117000	4119000	I don't know. It's just...
4119000	4121000	That's what it's called. Operation Semi-Sweet
4121000	4123000	Chocolate. With a little bit of nuts.
4123000	4125000	Operation... I don't get it.
4125000	4127000	Couple more news stories for you
4127000	4129000	guys right after the UK
4129000	4131000	releases. That's right. On the
4131000	4133000	29th we have Grand Theft Auto 4, The Ballad
4133000	4135000	of Gay Tony. On the 30th we
4135000	4137000	have Aggress Generations of War
4137000	4139000	Borderlands, DJ Hero
4139000	4141000	Fallout 3 Game of the Year edition,
4141000	4143000	Football Manager 2010,
4143000	4145000	Tekken 6, Feel,
4145000	4147000	that sounds dirty, Wii Fit
4147000	4149000	Plus, and Yoga for Wii.
4149000	4151000	Alright, we're gonna
4151000	4153000	get to the Classic Game of the Week very, very
4153000	4155000	soon here, but just two more stories for you guys
4155000	4157000	real quick, and then the break, and then our interview
4157000	4159000	with our pal Seg about
4159000	4161000	Unloud right after the break tonight.
4161000	4163000	You know, since we
4163000	4165000	were talking a little bit about
4165000	4167000	Fairytale Fights, they did have an achievement at one
4167000	4169000	point for killing children in this.
4169000	4171000	So not to be outdone, of course,
4171000	4173000	Dante's Inferno, the game
4173000	4175000	full of great ideas and awesome
4175000	4177000	promotions,
4177000	4179000	is now getting some
4179000	4181000	flak for
4181000	4183000	an achievement called Bad Nanny.
4183000	4185000	And this achievement
4185000	4187000	is... You've been a very bad
4187000	4189000	nanny, I can just see a super nanny.
4189000	4191000	This achievement is... You need to go and
4191000	4193000	sit on the naughty step.
4193000	4195000	You've been very naughty.
4195000	4197000	Apparently this achievement is for killing unbaptized
4197000	4199000	babies in the game.
4199000	4201000	But they're demon babies,
4201000	4203000	they're in hell, okay? Oh, well that makes it okay.
4203000	4205000	They're demon babies, but apparently, you know,
4205000	4207000	the International
4207000	4209000	Nanny Association, I
4209000	4211000	can't make that up, has
4211000	4213000	released a statement saying
4213000	4215000	that it's an offense to our
4215000	4217000	association.
4217000	4219000	Do they not have
4219000	4221000	a sense of humor? I mean, this isn't saying
4221000	4223000	that, you know, Bad
4223000	4225000	International Nanny Association
4225000	4227000	or something like that. My mom was
4227000	4229000	a nanny, actually, for many, many years,
4229000	4231000	and I can verify they do not have a sense
4231000	4233000	of humor. Actually,
4233000	4235000	my mom's hilarious, but I don't think she'd find that
4235000	4237000	funny. Your mom's a hoot.
4237000	4239000	It's a video game about
4239000	4241000	hell. I mean, they've got walls
4241000	4243000	made out of writhing naked people.
4243000	4245000	I mean, this isn't exactly,
4245000	4247000	this isn't saying you should go kill babies.
4247000	4249000	Just demon babies.
4249000	4251000	Are you saying we should go kill babies?
4251000	4253000	Demon babies, okay?
4253000	4255000	I mean, look at Silent Hill with the
4255000	4257000	smoke babies. I mean, yes, you need to kill
4257000	4259000	them because they're not human.
4259000	4261000	They're trying to eat you.
4261000	4263000	Or something.
4263000	4265000	Cats aren't human. Do you kill them?
4265000	4267000	No, I don't kill them.
4267000	4269000	But they're not demon babies, either.
4269000	4271000	Well, sometimes they are, but
4271000	4273000	most of the time, they're not.
4273000	4275000	Comment from xlink in chat chat
4275000	4277000	dot orange orange radio dot com. They say no to
4277000	4279000	this, but you can shoot kids in Fallout 3.
4279000	4281000	Hmm.
4281000	4283000	Those kids had it
4283000	4285000	coming.
4285000	4287000	Shut up.
4287000	4289000	Alright, speaking of things, I told you
4289000	4291000	we're coming before too long on a completely
4291000	4293000	different note. Remember when I said
4293000	4295000	don't discount Facebook gaming?
4295000	4297000	Uh oh.
4297000	4299000	There is a big, big new game coming to
4299000	4301000	Facebook. Civilization Network
4301000	4303000	has been announced for Facebook, and in my opinion,
4303000	4305000	this is huge, because this is
4305000	4307000	what it sounds like. It is a major
4307000	4309000	PC beloved franchise
4309000	4311000	colliding with the world of Facebook
4311000	4313000	games, and some of you are preparing your
4313000	4315000	block application thing on Facebook right
4315000	4317000	now, which, by the way, tangent warning.
4317000	4319000	What the hell is up with those changes
4319000	4321000	on Facebook?
4321000	4323000	What changes?
4323000	4325000	Ok, now they've changed it, so when you log in, you get
4325000	4327000	like a news feed that seems to be like a
4327000	4329000	random sampling of the stuff that you would see
4329000	4331000	before, like the popular stories.
4331000	4333000	If you want to see the live feed, you have to
4333000	4335000	click into that, but now the live feed
4335000	4337000	shows not just people's updates, but like
4337000	4339000	who became friends with who,
4339000	4341000	and all this stuff that you really don't want to see.
4341000	4343000	All the stuff we don't care about.
4343000	4345000	Yay, more stuff we get to block.
4345000	4347000	But you can't block it, because if you block it, then
4347000	4349000	you block the person that did the friending.
4349000	4351000	So yeah, Facebook didn't think that one through.
4351000	4353000	I know, exactly, Facebook didn't think that one through very well.
4353000	4355000	Anyhow, sorry, I digress.
4355000	4357000	Civilization Network is making its way
4357000	4359000	to Facebook, and it's supposed to be out sometime
4359000	4361000	in 2010. There's actually a
4361000	4363000	Facebook page already set up.
4363000	4365000	It's on facebook.com
4365000	4367000	slash civnetwork, C-I-V
4367000	4369000	network, and they're going to be on the
4369000	4371000	lookout for beta testers very soon.
4371000	4373000	Sid Meier himself has said that the
4373000	4375000	game will offer everything that people
4375000	4377000	love about Civ in a quote
4377000	4379000	fully persistent environment.
4379000	4381000	Best of all, the game
4381000	4383000	will be free.
4383000	4385000	I like free.
4385000	4387000	Brian Reynolds, who is behind Civilization 2
4387000	4389000	and Alpha Centauri, has
4389000	4391000	the job of chief designer at
4391000	4393000	the social gaming developer site
4393000	4395000	Zynga. It's kind of an interesting
4395000	4397000	little coincidence. He has nothing to do with this game,
4397000	4399000	but it's interesting
4399000	4401000	that he did so much with that now he's at this
4401000	4403000	other company, so you think maybe old friends maybe
4403000	4405000	got together at dinner talking about this, who knows.
4405000	4407000	But Facebook
4407000	4409000	gaming dude, it's
4409000	4411000	coming. This is going to be something we're going to
4411000	4413000	see in the next few months, just get bigger and bigger.
4413000	4415000	Yep.
4415000	4417000	Alright, now we're going to get into a section of the show
4417000	4419000	that we like to get into every week. It's a section
4419000	4421000	for Dark Sakura to open up the gaming vault
4421000	4423000	and take a travel through
4423000	4425000	gaming's past. It's a segment we call
4425000	4427000	the Classic Game of the
4427000	4429000	Week. Dark Sakura, what video game do
4429000	4431000	you think the kids should be playing this week?
4431000	4433000	For those in the US,
4433000	4435000	it is Galactic Attack.
4435000	4437000	It has been
4437000	4439000	known by many other names.
4439000	4441000	In
4441000	4443000	Japan, in the arcade, it was called
4443000	4445000	Ray Force, but because of licensing
4445000	4447000	it came out as a layer section
4447000	4449000	on the Saturn. We got it
4449000	4451000	as Galactic Attack, and in Europe they got it
4451000	4453000	as Gun Lock. But it is
4453000	4455000	in the Ray
4455000	4457000	series, Ray Force, Ray
4457000	4459000	Storm, and Ray Crisis.
4459000	4461000	It's a pretty freaking amazing shooting
4461000	4463000	game.
4463000	4465000	I love the way that it plays because
4465000	4467000	not only do you have the stuff coming from you
4467000	4469000	from right above, you also target
4469000	4471000	below your ship
4471000	4473000	and can launch
4473000	4475000	missiles at targets in the
4475000	4477000	background, or as it should be
4477000	4479000	toward the bottom.
4479000	4481000	Do you want to add something to that?
4481000	4483000	No, unless you want to hear some of the
4483000	4485000	lovely little shooting sound effects here.
4485000	4491000	At least it's good.
4491000	4493000	Definitely sounds like a shooting game.
4493000	4495000	Bullets, bullets, and more bullets.
4495000	4497000	It really is. It is
4497000	4499000	just one of the
4499000	4501000	regular old
4501000	4503000	shooting games.
4503000	4505000	I think it's one of Taito's best.
4505000	4507000	I love the entire
4507000	4509000	series.
4509000	4511000	Ray Storm and Ray Crisis
4511000	4513000	were fantastic, but
4513000	4515000	this, to me, I think is what really
4515000	4517000	gave it to us.
4517000	4519000	It's, to this day, one of my favorite
4519000	4521000	shooters and one of the reasons to have
4521000	4523000	a rotating widescreen monitor.
4523000	4525000	That's it.
4525000	4527000	Alright.
4527000	4529000	So there it is, your classic game of the week.
4529000	4531000	It goes by several different names, right?
4531000	4533000	We have Galactic Attack in the US.
4533000	4535000	Gunlock in Europe.
4535000	4537000	Layer Section for the Japanese
4537000	4539000	home version, and in the arcade
4539000	4541000	it was Ray Storm.
4541000	4543000	Why couldn't they just pick one name?
4543000	4545000	Because of licensing.
4545000	4547000	It was fully licensing.
4547000	4549000	Alright, well there you have it, your classic game of the week.
4549000	4551000	Many, many different names
4551000	4553000	for that one. Check it out on
4553000	4555000	the Sega Saturn. Jamie loves
4555000	4557000	her Sega games. Yes, she does.
4557000	4559000	I sure do. Alright.
4559000	4561000	Well, that's going to do it for this part A of our podcast,
4561000	4563000	but don't go anywhere. We're going to be right back
4563000	4565000	with plenty more in part B. We have a lot
4565000	4567000	coming up on deck in part B tonight. Not only do we
4567000	4569000	have some news, some
4569000	4571000	quick little stories here about what's coming out
4571000	4573000	on Rock Band and Xbox Live, and
4573000	4575000	some news on Star Trek Online,
4575000	4577000	and Beatles Rock Band, and so forth.
4577000	4579000	But we have an interview coming up. Our pal
4579000	4581000	Seg is the man behind a charity
4581000	4583000	event coming up in the Bay Area very soon
4583000	4585000	known as Umlaud.
4585000	4587000	And we're going to be talking to him about what's going to go down
4587000	4589000	in December, just a few weeks away
4589000	4591000	if you can believe it. The year's almost up.
4591000	4593000	But it's all for a great cause. We're going to talk to Seg
4593000	4595000	all about it right after this quick break.
4595000	4597000	So don't go anywhere. We'll be right back with more
4597000	4599000	of Orange Lounge Radio.
4627000	4629000	It's allgamesradio.com. That's how I usually
4629000	4631000	go in there. Or there's also a
4631000	4633000	radio app that you can get on your iPhone if you just
4633000	4635000	search for All Games in the store. They are the
4635000	4637000	folks who we steal our bandwidth from every week.
4637000	4639000	And we really, really appreciate
4639000	4641000	it. So anyway, we're going to move into
4641000	4643000	something a little different here. Usually we'll be doing
4643000	4645000	Twitter topics about now, but we're actually going to invite
4645000	4647000	a friend of the program on the show.
4647000	4649000	And he goes by Seg online, but his name is
4649000	4651000	John Segerson. He actually goes by the
4651000	4653000	nickname Seg. And he is one of the minds behind
4653000	4655000	Umlaud, which is a charity event that
4655000	4657000	is happening in San Francisco at the DNA
4657000	4659000	Lounge Wednesday, December 9th
4659000	4661000	of this year, 7 p.m.
4661000	4663000	to 2 a.m. It is a rock band
4663000	4665000	event for Child's Play charity.
4665000	4667000	And, you know, we like to talk about
4667000	4669000	charity events and gamers doing
4669000	4671000	good things. So we're going to give Seg a call
4671000	4673000	and get him on the show to talk
4673000	4675000	to us a little bit about Umlaud.
4675000	4677000	So we're going to go ahead and
4677000	4679000	ring him up on Skype right now
4679000	4681000	and see what happens.
4681000	4683000	Hello, Orange Lounge Radio.
4683000	4685000	Seg, how are you? I'm doing
4685000	4687000	fabulous yourself. We're very good.
4687000	4689000	Hey, thank you so much for being here live tonight.
4689000	4691000	You know, a little secret of Orange Lounge Radio,
4691000	4693000	most of our interviews are not done live, but
4693000	4695000	you were good enough to actually be here live during the
4695000	4697000	show tonight and be with us live.
4697000	4699000	So thank you very much. No, no, no.
4699000	4701000	Thank you for having us. You know,
4701000	4703000	it's, we
4703000	4705000	have a great event that we want to share with people
4705000	4707000	and we want to make sure everyone knows about it.
4707000	4709000	Alright, well tell us all about it. I'm going to start off
4709000	4711000	what is Umlaud?
4711000	4713000	It's an Umlaud,
4713000	4715000	or Umlaud, but louder.
4715000	4717000	It's a charity
4717000	4719000	event for Child's Play
4719000	4721000	charity, which provides
4721000	4723000	video games, toys, and other financial support
4723000	4725000	to children's hospitals around the globe.
4725000	4727000	And our event
4727000	4729000	is we play
4729000	4731000	Rock Band as
4731000	4733000	a catalyst for
4733000	4735000	people donating money to Child's Play.
4735000	4737000	But now, is
4737000	4739000	Rock Band the only thing that's going on at this event
4739000	4741000	or is this kind of like just a big party where Rock Band's
4741000	4743000	kind of in the corner? How does this work?
4743000	4745000	Well, actually, this is going to be
4745000	4747000	a very different
4747000	4749000	kind of Rock Band night than
4749000	4751000	most Rock Band
4751000	4753000	nights. I mean, usually when people go out
4753000	4755000	to do Rock Band
4755000	4757000	at like a bar or something, you know, it's there, but it's
4757000	4759000	you know, it's just everyone playing
4759000	4761000	to a projector and all that.
4761000	4763000	We're doing something a little bit
4763000	4765000	more.
4765000	4767000	We'll have one area
4767000	4769000	of just regular Rock Band play,
4769000	4771000	no fuss or anything, in the upstairs
4771000	4773000	lounge area. But
4773000	4775000	for the main event,
4775000	4777000	you're playing Rock Band on
4777000	4779000	the DNA lounge
4779000	4781000	stage, a San Francisco concert
4781000	4783000	venue. And you'll be performing
4783000	4785000	Rock Band as a band
4785000	4787000	on a concert stage to an audience.
4787000	4789000	So it's more than just
4789000	4791000	just playing Rock Band to the projector
4791000	4793000	and all that. You're actually, you are
4793000	4795000	putting on a
4795000	4797000	rock concert
4797000	4799000	for people. And
4799000	4801000	depending on what kind of
4801000	4803000	band package you donate to,
4803000	4805000	you can really get the
4805000	4807000	ultimate rock concert performance
4807000	4809000	experience with the lighting, band
4809000	4811000	introduction, the whole nine yards.
4811000	4813000	Tell us a little more about some of these different experiences
4813000	4815000	that, you know, Rock Band
4815000	4817000	wannabes or however you want to phrase it,
4817000	4819000	because you talk about how you can
4819000	4821000	actually get up on a real stage that
4821000	4823000	quote unquote real bands are performed
4823000	4825000	up on. I mean, is that something that's
4825000	4827000	accessible to everybody, or what are the different options
4827000	4829000	for my band to showcase at this event?
4829000	4831000	So, first of all,
4831000	4833000	I do want to say that we do have two
4833000	4835000	stages, and one stage is free for
4835000	4837000	anybody to show up, and we'll get in a little
4837000	4839000	later of
4839000	4841000	what everybody can do.
4841000	4843000	But if you and three of
4843000	4845000	your friends really want
4845000	4847000	to perform on the main stage,
4847000	4849000	we have two
4849000	4851000	packages to perform on the main stage.
4851000	4853000	There's a standard band package,
4853000	4855000	which we're going to
4855000	4857000	ask for a $40 donation,
4857000	4859000	but if you order online, it's $35.
4859000	4861000	And that's the whole band.
4861000	4863000	So if you split that up to four people,
4863000	4865000	that's $8.75
4865000	4867000	a person.
4867000	4869000	And for the standard band package, you get to
4869000	4871000	play on the stage. You just
4871000	4873000	play on the stage regularly, but you're still playing
4873000	4875000	to the crowd on a major San Francisco
4875000	4877000	stage. Now if you want to rock
4877000	4879000	harder,
4879000	4881000	that's where our ultimate band package comes in.
4881000	4883000	If you want to put some extra oomph in your oomph
4883000	4885000	loud. Exactly.
4885000	4887000	And we're asking
4887000	4889000	for $120
4889000	4891000	for the donation, but again, that's the band
4891000	4893000	package, so it amounts to $30. And you get
4893000	4895000	a little bit,
4895000	4897000	you get more into it
4897000	4899000	with this package, where
4899000	4901000	you first get to reserve
4901000	4903000	your song ahead of time, and we are going to have
4903000	4905000	a rule with just the main stage
4905000	4907000	that once a song's
4907000	4909000	played, it's not going to be played again.
4909000	4911000	And we're doing that
4911000	4913000	because we will have
4913000	4915000	every
4915000	4917000	song on rock band
4917000	4919000	available. Nice. We actually partnered
4919000	4921000	up with Harmonix with this, and they will be
4921000	4923000	providing
4923000	4925000	stuff that can be played on rock
4925000	4927000	band two, but all of it.
4927000	4929000	So there's those few
4929000	4931000	songs on rock band one
4931000	4933000	that won't be included.
4933000	4935000	And Beatles doesn't count for
4935000	4937000	the main stage, because it's just hard to
4937000	4939000	get people through without
4939000	4941000	switching discs. Yeah, you don't want to have to switch discs all the time.
4941000	4943000	That makes sense. Is it still like, what, a thousand songs
4943000	4945000	to pick from? Yeah, it's about a thousand
4945000	4947000	songs, you know. So
4947000	4949000	we feel we're comfortable in doing this because
4949000	4951000	it'd be pretty lame to have the same
4951000	4953000	song played
4953000	4955000	again. So if you're
4955000	4957000	in the ultimate band package, you get to reserve it ahead of time.
4957000	4959000	So that's
4959000	4961000	one thing. You also
4961000	4963000	get, each member of your band
4963000	4965000	will get lanyards,
4965000	4967000	you know, that sort of VIP pass
4967000	4969000	thing.
4969000	4971000	That's a nice little take-home memento. You also
4971000	4973000	get, you'll get a gift bag for each
4973000	4975000	band member,
4975000	4977000	four bags.
4977000	4979000	And when you're about
4979000	4981000	to go on stage, you'll be introduced as your
4981000	4983000	band. You have to pick a name for your band, and we'll make
4983000	4985000	an introduction for you.
4985000	4987000	And we get
4987000	4989000	the lighting guy involved, and it
4989000	4991000	just really makes it
4991000	4993000	the kind of experience you
4993000	4995000	really can't
4995000	4997000	get anywhere with it. Did you get the rock band
4997000	4999000	Fog Machine? Who needs the
4999000	5001000	Fog Machine? You'll have the full
5001000	5003000	lighting setup of the
5003000	5005000	DNA Lounges concert
5005000	5007000	venue stage. I guess true enough.
5007000	5009000	You get industrial strength.
5009000	5011000	Yes, you get the industrial strength
5011000	5013000	concert. Fair enough, fair enough.
5013000	5015000	And for those folks that are thinking, oh my gosh,
5015000	5017000	$120, that's a lot of money, keep in mind
5017000	5019000	this is, you know, a
5019000	5021000	once in a, you know, never
5021000	5023000	type experience that you can get getting a play on the
5023000	5025000	stage, and B, the fact that it's
5025000	5027000	going to charity. I mean, it's not like going in
5027000	5029000	Sake's pocket, it's going to a great charity.
5029000	5031000	Yes, it's going to Child's Play.
5031000	5033000	We really want to stress that this
5033000	5035000	is a donation, and
5035000	5037000	we are, the
5037000	5039000	money that you give is going to
5039000	5041000	Child's Play.
5041000	5043000	So it's, you know, I mean,
5043000	5045000	if you stood back and just saw it as
5045000	5047000	the value of just like, what would I pay
5047000	5049000	just to play rock band? It's, you're
5049000	5051000	kind of thinking it a little
5051000	5053000	wrong in this context. This is
5053000	5055000	a donation to which we are
5055000	5057000	thanking you by giving you this experience.
5057000	5059000	And plus it's just a chance to kind of get together
5059000	5061000	with other nerds and have a good time. Yes, exactly.
5061000	5063000	Now, here's the thing, is this because
5063000	5065000	it's a rock concert, is it 18 up,
5065000	5067000	21 and up, or? No, it is an all
5067000	5069000	ages show at DNA Lounge.
5069000	5071000	Yeah, we like to
5071000	5073000	say it's T for teen and that, you know,
5073000	5075000	we don't want people to think that
5075000	5077000	because it's for Child's
5077000	5079000	Play charity that it's for little kids.
5079000	5081000	True. Just, you know, but it's
5081000	5083000	an all ages show. Because if someone gets up
5083000	5085000	on stage and doesn't censor the lyrics
5085000	5087000	to a song that may have the F word in it, you
5087000	5089000	don't want no one to get offended. Yeah.
5089000	5091000	But it's all in good fun.
5091000	5093000	But let me talk about, you know, I've been talking
5093000	5095000	about the band packages, which is definitely the
5095000	5097000	higher end stuff. Please do.
5097000	5099000	But I really,
5099000	5101000	for people who don't, you know, don't
5101000	5103000	want to perform and all that,
5103000	5105000	it is a free
5105000	5107000	event. We won't turn
5107000	5109000	anyone away if they don't pay at the door.
5109000	5111000	We are asking for a $10
5111000	5113000	donation because
5113000	5115000	this is a charity event.
5115000	5117000	But no one will be turned
5117000	5119000	away. And even if you don't
5119000	5121000	do the donation, you will get two
5121000	5123000	raffle tickets for our prize
5123000	5125000	raffle. And our prize raffle
5125000	5127000	is stuff that we've been
5127000	5129000	that
5129000	5131000	my co-words Chris
5131000	5133000	Fuller, Joe Marquette, have been
5133000	5135000	collecting throughout
5135000	5137000	the year of all this swag and all this stuff
5137000	5139000	and they've been piling up in their
5139000	5141000	apartments. And we're going to
5141000	5143000	give the stuff away as prizes
5143000	5145000	in this free raffle.
5145000	5147000	So there's a lot of incentive there.
5147000	5149000	And actually Chris is doing
5149000	5151000	a prize a day on our blog at
5151000	5153000	umloud.org
5153000	5155000	that's umloud.org
5155000	5157000	where he'll take a
5157000	5159000	photo of some of the things that he'll have
5159000	5161000	and post it so you can see
5161000	5163000	the kinds of things that we'll be
5163000	5165000	giving away on that night.
5165000	5167000	Now I know this is an event
5167000	5169000	that's being hosted at the DNA Lounge which is
5169000	5171000	on 11th Street in San Francisco and again
5171000	5173000	the date and time if you missed it, December 9th, 2009
5173000	5175000	that's a Wednesday, 7 p.m.
5175000	5177000	till 2 a.m. like most bars are open till
5177000	5179000	2 a.m. But what if
5179000	5181000	we have listeners all over the globe really?
5181000	5183000	How can people help out if they can't
5183000	5185000	be there in San Francisco on that night?
5185000	5187000	Yes, I know
5187000	5189000	our event is around San Francisco
5189000	5191000	and all that, but if you can't make it to San Francisco
5191000	5193000	or any of the other
5193000	5195000	kinds of events that are
5195000	5197000	happening, please
5197000	5199000	consider a donation to
5199000	5201000	Child's Play Charity.
5201000	5203000	Just go directly to them.
5203000	5205000	They're childsplaycharity.org
5205000	5207000	and just consider
5207000	5209000	a donation direct to them.
5209000	5211000	We're doing this thing here in San Francisco
5211000	5213000	because of the success of
5213000	5215000	Fundrazer last year and a lot of
5215000	5217000	people liked it and it's the kind of thing that we know
5217000	5219000	that a lot of
5219000	5221000	people come to and we want to
5221000	5223000	facilitate that, but what we're really
5223000	5225000	here is to show
5225000	5227000	to create
5227000	5229000	awareness to Child's Play Charity
5229000	5231000	as a whole and this is
5231000	5233000	one micro chasm of the
5233000	5235000	many things going on in the gaming
5235000	5237000	community to help Child's
5237000	5239000	Play Charity. Well I think it's a
5239000	5241000	great cause and it's a really fun event and you know
5241000	5243000	if nothing else, even if people are like shy
5243000	5245000	you know one thing that should be said is that
5245000	5247000	this isn't just for people
5247000	5249000	that love attention of getting up on stage and all
5249000	5251000	that. If you just kind of want to come hang with
5251000	5253000	cool people, come to this event
5253000	5255000	because I'm going to be there and I believe
5255000	5257000	Dark Soccer is going to be there and we're trying to
5257000	5259000	get Loki there so hopefully we'll all be there
5259000	5261000	so come hang with us. Yes and we'll definitely have
5261000	5263000	more, I mean there's stuff that we're
5263000	5265000	working on and I can't really put on, you know
5265000	5267000	say right now, but don't feel
5267000	5269000	that just because you didn't pay
5269000	5271000	for, you know you didn't get the package
5271000	5273000	the band package thing that there's nothing
5273000	5275000	for you. There will be plenty
5275000	5277000	of things for you to do. You will have a good time
5277000	5279000	just showing up so please
5279000	5281000	please come by
5281000	5283000	we'd love to have you
5283000	5285000	it's again for
5285000	5287000	all the information of this, there are many
5287000	5289000	other things, please come to our website
5289000	5291000	umloud.org
5291000	5293000	that's u-m-l-o-u-d.org
5293000	5295000	and we hope to see you there.
5295000	5297000	And I just wanted to mention this real quick
5297000	5299000	I'm kind of glancing through chat here and I see Tiger
5299000	5301000	Claw in chat says something about DNA
5301000	5303000	Lounge seems to have like a live
5303000	5305000	video stream? Oh yes
5305000	5307000	that's right, yes there will be a live video stream
5307000	5309000	that will be turned on
5309000	5311000	during our events so
5311000	5313000	you can also see us
5313000	5315000	rock out, all the
5315000	5317000	bands, it's
5317000	5319000	going to be centered on the main stage
5319000	5321000	I believe and you
5321000	5323000	can view it from anywhere
5323000	5325000	during the night as well. Oh well now we
5325000	5327000	have to figure out a way to get up on that main stage
5327000	5329000	so that the listeners around can see
5329000	5331000	it so we're going to have to try and get Loki there
5331000	5333000	if he can't make it we'll get some of our friends to come
5333000	5335000	so we can get our president cat
5335000	5337000	band up on stage
5337000	5339000	and do order soon because we only have
5339000	5341000	a limited amount of the band packages
5341000	5343000	so we really
5343000	5345000	if you really want to do
5345000	5347000	it, get on the boat soon
5347000	5349000	to do the band packages
5349000	5351000	we'll have a few of the standard on hand
5351000	5353000	but that's sort of our release valve
5353000	5355000	to make sure that everyone who's
5355000	5357000	paid for a package gets to play on the stage
5357000	5359000	and we're also increasing the price
5359000	5361000	a little more
5361000	5363000	on the night of for the standard band package
5363000	5365000	so if you really want to do that
5365000	5367000	if you think, if you
5367000	5369000	really
5369000	5371000	want to do this, please order
5371000	5373000	soon than later
5373000	5375000	Alright, so once again this is

5399000	5401000	And that's so important for an event like this
5401000	5403000	It's so important

5405000	5407000	to get to the website, just a normal You

5493000	5495000	right into a story about rock band
5495000	5497000	some more songs you can play at this event
5497000	5499000	Exactly, some more songs you may be able to play
5499000	5501000	during the event
5501000	5503000	This week we're getting new tracks from Rob Zombie
5503000	5505000	and Wolf Mother
5505000	5507000	among other things
5507000	5509000	They've got a whole variety pack here
5509000	5511000	Looks like some morning wood tracks as well
5511000	5513000	Anyways, starting things off
5513000	5515000	Rob Zombie pack 1
5515000	5517000	which I got to say has got some sweet
5517000	5519000	songs in it, definitely something I'm going to be
5519000	5521000	purchasing
5521000	5523000	including Burn, Dragula, and Superbeast
5523000	5525000	It's about freaking time Dragula's in the game
5525000	5527000	Hell yes
5527000	5529000	What song are we going to sing?
5529000	5531000	That would be a perfect song
5531000	5533000	You want to do Dragula?
5533000	5535000	I can get up on there and do my best Rob Zombie
5535000	5537000	I'll have to get a big curly wig or something
5537000	5539000	We'll figure something out
5539000	5541000	Anyways, the Wolf Mother pack 1
5541000	5543000	is going to have five tracks
5543000	5545000	and that will include
5545000	5547000	New Moon Rising, Pilgrim, Sundial,
5547000	5549000	White Unicorn, and Woman
5549000	5551000	Finally, they have a few individual songs
5551000	5553000	including
5553000	5555000	Liz Fair, Rock Me, Morning Wood Best of Me
5555000	5557000	and Morning Wood
5557000	5559000	Sugar Baby
5559000	5561000	and each of those are available
5561000	5563000	Actually, the Morning Wood tracks are half off
5563000	5565000	so it's only a buck
5565000	5567000	or 80 Microsoft points
5567000	5569000	Everything else individually is
5569000	5571000	$1.99 or 200
5571000	5573000	Wii points or
5573000	5575000	160 Microsoft points
5575000	5577000	and of course the packs are a little bit cheaper
5577000	5579000	The Rob Zombie pack is $549
5579000	5581000	or 440 Microsoft points
5581000	5583000	680
5583000	5585000	Microsoft points for the Wolf Mother pack
5585000	5587000	or $849 in real money
5587000	5589000	and then of course the
5589000	5591000	PSP, they're getting
5591000	5593000	Sonic Youth, Cool Thing
5593000	5595000	and Stealing and My Old School
5595000	5597000	both of those for two bucks
5597000	5599000	and then they go along
5599000	5601000	with releases
5601000	5603000	Konami has confirmed that
5603000	5605000	they're going to be releasing a
5605000	5607000	port of Shadow of Destiny
5607000	5609000	which came out I believe on PlayStation 2
5609000	5611000	not too long ago
5611000	5613000	and
5613000	5615000	yeah
5615000	5617000	I guess it's nice to see them actually
5617000	5619000	putting out some new games and stuff
5619000	5621000	and the game is
5621000	5623000	I guess
5623000	5625000	comparing it to Groundhog Day
5625000	5627000	but I guess to the point where
5627000	5629000	the person dies
5629000	5631000	over and over and over again
5631000	5633000	I don't know, I remember it being a pretty decent game
5633000	5635000	when it came out on PlayStation 2
5635000	5637000	Alright, well speaking of release dates
5637000	5639000	it's not very often we're talking about a game coming out early
5639000	5641000	in fact this year it's been talking about all these games
5641000	5643000	getting delayed to 2010
5643000	5645000	but Need for Speed Nitro
5645000	5647000	that's the new Need for Speed entry on the Nintendo Wii and DS
5647000	5649000	has had its release bumped up
5649000	5651000	it was originally going to come out November 17th
5651000	5653000	but guess what, it's now coming out
5653000	5655000	November 3rd here in the US
5655000	5657000	and November 6th over in Europe
5657000	5659000	so it actually got out a little early
5659000	5661000	I actually checked this out at E3
5661000	5663000	it was pretty cool for a Wii game
5663000	5665000	I know that sounds kind of harsh
5665000	5667000	but usually when you think Need for Speed and racing games
5667000	5669000	you think, oh the top of the line graphics
5669000	5671000	you're not going to get that on the Wii
5671000	5673000	but it was a good arcade game
5673000	5675000	for arcade silly fun
5675000	5677000	it was pretty cool
5677000	5679000	it didn't really feel like other Need for Speed games to me
5679000	5681000	but maybe that's just me
5681000	5683000	on Xbox Live, Rainbow Islands
5683000	5685000	Towering Adventure is coming out on Xbox Live
5685000	5687000	yes, that would be Rainbow Islands
5687000	5689000	that game that was once inspired
5689000	5691000	by Bubble Bobble
5691000	5693000	it was kind of like a sequel to Bubble Bobble
5693000	5695000	it was a little different, it was still Bub and Bob
5695000	5697000	but they were shooting rainbows
5697000	5699000	although I noticed in the screenshots for this game
5699000	5701000	I don't see Bub and Bob
5701000	5703000	it's like a new little guy here
5703000	5705000	so this is some new little spinoff game
5705000	5707000	it's Rainbow Islands Towering Adventure
5707000	5709000	it is actually a port of a WiiWare game
5709000	5711000	that came out a little while ago
5711000	5713000	so it's coming out very, very soon
5713000	5715000	also for those who are in Europe
5715000	5717000	and can make it and are interested
5717000	5719000	there's some playable Star Trek Online
5719000	5721000	at Eurogamer Expo
5721000	5723000	they're almost out of tickets too
5723000	5725000	but that's on Wednesday the 28th
5725000	5727000	in Leeds
5727000	5729000	and yeah, they're almost sold out
5729000	5731000	but you can actually
5731000	5735000	play on one of the gaming PCs there
5735000	5737000	and
5737000	5741000	it's different level demos
5741000	5743000	you can do ship to ship and planet combat
5743000	5745000	and you can
5745000	5747000	shoot Klingons in space
5747000	5749000	and you can actually
5749000	5751000	I think play as Klingons
5751000	5753000	in that one too
5753000	5755000	and also you can go visit
5755000	5757000	the giant lopsided donut
5757000	5759000	I mean the Guardian of Forever
5759000	5761000	so, should be fun
5763000	5765000	and
5765000	5767000	Bayonetta
5767000	5769000	Bayonetta has done something major
5769000	5771000	it is the first Xbox 360 game
5771000	5773000	that got a perfect score from Famitsu
5773000	5775000	it got a perfect 40-40
5775000	5777000	although now Bayonetta is cross platform
5777000	5779000	it just happens that Xbox 360
5779000	5781000	is one of the platforms it's on, correct?
5781000	5783000	and also the better version
5783000	5785000	yeah, the other one got 38
5785000	5787000	oh, so they did review both
5787000	5789000	I didn't know that Famitsu did that
5789000	5791000	very interesting
5791000	5793000	well, there are, if you actually
5793000	5795000	look for movies on YouTube
5795000	5797000	of them side by side
5797000	5799000	you will see a noticeable difference
5799000	5801000	interesting, now Famitsu magazine
5801000	5803000	doesn't hand out 40s very often
5803000	5805000	although it seems like we've had a few of these stories
5805000	5807000	in the past few years
5807000	5809000	sometimes you kind of raise an eyebrow at the games they give 40s to
5809000	5811000	like, I believe Nintendogs was one of their 40 titles
5811000	5813000	but, you know, there's a lot of
5813000	5815000	really, really great games in the past
5815000	5817000	like Final Fantasy XII and so forth that got this as well
5817000	5819000	so it definitely is a distinction, I think only what a dozen games
5819000	5821000	in the history of the magazine have had it
5821000	5823000	I think so, Famitsu is really tough
5823000	5825000	so Bayonetta, getting that is a big, like, whoa
5825000	5827000	whoa, hello
5827000	5829000	well, I'm totally getting Bayonetta
5829000	5831000	at the game, or just
5831000	5833000	we're only hearing about the 40s right now
5833000	5835000	I think it's just the 40s so far
5835000	5837000	let me double check
5837000	5839000	Salacious Pop clarifies, by the way
5839000	5841000	they gave the PS3 version of 38 because the port
5841000	5843000	is muddy and bad, it looks brown
5843000	5845000	and is missing quite a bit of particles
5845000	5847000	ouch
5847000	5849000	yeah, they're not really saying why
5849000	5851000	but yeah, just seriously, look at them side by side
5851000	5853000	38's still not bad
5853000	5855000	that's why it's intense, it's like, oh, it's crappy
5855000	5857000	I think President Cat
5857000	5859000	got, what, like a 24
5859000	5861000	from Famitsu, but they're kind of
5861000	5863000	yeah, they're used to seeing these games a lot
5863000	5865000	too, I think it's a lot different for them
5865000	5867000	than it was for us, maybe like a generic party game
5867000	5869000	coming out over here on the Wii, I mean
5869000	5871000	those are, you know, a dime a dozen
5871000	5873000	whereas Cat Games, there's two
5873000	5875000	maybe a little bit more, but
5875000	5877000	about a handful
5877000	5879000	alright, moving on to
5879000	5881000	some more gaming news
5881000	5883000	and your phone calls a little later on tonight
5883000	5885000	in the mailbag, we still have that to get to
5885000	5887000	controller patent, this controller
5887000	5889000	looks odd
5889000	5891000	and, well, I guess it's
5891000	5893000	normal for them, since they have the Cosmic Ice Cream
5893000	5895000	cone, but this controller
5895000	5897000	looks like, it's like a cylinder with
5897000	5899000	the end cut off and four buttons on it
5899000	5901000	no word on what
5901000	5903000	the hell this is going to be used for, possibly
5903000	5905000	designed for their new remote
5905000	5907000	their motion controller device
5907000	5909000	sans
5909000	5911000	ice cream, I guess
5911000	5913000	but
5913000	5915000	this world looks like a sex toy
5915000	5917000	too, so, I don't know
5919000	5921000	uh, that sounds kinda gross
5921000	5923000	yeah
5923000	5925000	hmm
5925000	5927000	but, uh, so this is not like
5927000	5929000	these are actually coming
5929000	5931000	out, this is just a list of
5931000	5933000	this is what could have been, or what is this
5933000	5935000	it's a design, they may go with it
5935000	5937000	they may not go with it, it's just like, you know
5937000	5939000	Nintendo with their inflatable chair of
5939000	5941000	fun, you know, it might come out
5941000	5943000	it might not, it's just an idea
5943000	5945000	I thought everything was sold on the whole, like, lights thing
5945000	5947000	or the changing light dot
5947000	5949000	beam looking thing, now
5949000	5951000	I thought that's what we were going at
5951000	5953000	well, maybe they decided to change
5953000	5955000	the way they look, maybe the
5955000	5957000	maybe there's a light on here
5957000	5959000	that we don't see or something, I don't know
5959000	5961000	to me it looks like a plastic cylinder that
5961000	5963000	has four buttons on top
5963000	5965000	well, you know what though
5965000	5967000	I don't, I don't
5967000	5969000	I have a lot of faith in Sony when it comes to
5969000	5971000	controller design, because I still love
5971000	5973000	the PlayStation controllers, although then again
5973000	5975000	I say that and then at the same time I think
5975000	5977000	yeah, but then they did take DualShock out of the PS3
5977000	5979000	but that was a whole different reason, that wasn't really a design
5979000	5981000	well it's because they didn't want to pay royalties
5981000	5983000	but, you know, the
5983000	5985000	PlayStation 3 controller is still a rock solid
5985000	5987000	controller, especially, you know, and I
5987000	5989000	took some crap last week for saying this, but
5989000	5991000	especially compared to the 360 controller, which
5991000	5993000	you know, the D-pad leaves a lot
5993000	5995000	to be desired on the 360 controller
5995000	5997000	the PS3 is a pretty slick controller
5997000	5999000	especially the newer ones, so you know
5999000	6001000	I kind of trust their judgement when it comes to
6001000	6003000	making controllers, they usually don't make bad ones
6003000	6005000	except that boomerang thing was really weird
6005000	6007000	but that never did come out
6007000	6009000	that was only a concept thing, so
6009000	6011000	maybe that light thing went the way of the boomerang
6011000	6013000	but thankfully we do live in the day
6013000	6015000	and the age of the internet
6015000	6017000	because if this was like, you know
6017000	6019000	the mid 90s where all we had were gaming magazines
6019000	6021000	that boomerang would have come out
6021000	6023000	possibly, because they wouldn't have heard
6023000	6025000	the horrible feedback
6025000	6027000	I don't think, I don't know
6027000	6029000	this is like a debate that's years old at this point
6029000	6031000	but I don't know if the boomerang was necessarily a bad
6031000	6033000	thing, I'd have to feel it in my hands
6033000	6035000	if it felt fine to control with
6035000	6037000	I would have been okay with the weird design
6037000	6039000	but I just think at the same time
6039000	6041000	the PlayStation controller is like one of the
6041000	6043000	best controllers ever, why ruin
6043000	6045000	a good thing? You know, look at the PS1
6045000	6047000	PS2, PS3 controllers, they've all
6047000	6049000	been pretty much the same, and there's a reason for that
6049000	6051000	you know, granted they added
6051000	6053000	rumble to it at some point along the way
6053000	6055000	they added dual, you know, and all that
6055000	6057000	pretty much though it stayed consistent
6059000	6061000	alright, moving on to another
6061000	6063000	news story having to do with Beatles Rock Band
6063000	6065000	Beatles Rock Band
6065000	6067000	has actually beaten Guitar Hero 5
6067000	6069000	on the sales chart
6069000	6071000	this is based on US September
6071000	6073000	sales, yeah, believe it or not
6073000	6075000	the Beatles
6075000	6077000	was released September 9th and Guitar Hero 5
6077000	6079000	was released September 1st, the Beatles has moved
6079000	6081000	595,000
6081000	6083000	units to 499
6083000	6085000	units of Guitar Hero 5
6085000	6087000	granted that's really close
6087000	6089000	but also it should be noted that
6089000	6091000	the All You Need Is Love download track
6091000	6093000	100,000 downloads
6093000	6095000	in September, so this is only
6095000	6097000	considering September, it's not considering the
6097000	6099000	important Christmas period, I don't want to start
6099000	6101000	all this like OMG Guitar Hero 5
6101000	6103000	but it is a little surprising
6103000	6105000	considering Beatles
6105000	6107000	Rock Band to some was kind of a niche title
6107000	6109000	I don't think it is
6109000	6111000	surprising to me because they went all out
6111000	6113000	with Guitar Hero 5 as far as trying to get people
6113000	6115000	to buy it, I mean they were throwing in a free game
6115000	6117000	even, you know, to really push that first
6117000	6119000	month numbers and it failed
6119000	6121000	is this a sign that people are
6121000	6123000	kind of wising up to the 50,000
6123000	6125000	releases in a year?
6125000	6127000	I don't know, it'll be
6127000	6129000	interesting to see what's going to happen
6129000	6131000	I'm not remotely surprised, I'm surprised it didn't sell more
6131000	6133000	a lot of people are actually surprised
6133000	6135000	the Beatles game didn't sell more, but of course
6135000	6137000	you know, this game will move throughout
6137000	6139000	Christmas, I mean both of these games
6139000	6141000	are still going to continue to move, but it is a very
6141000	6143000	I mean, doesn't Guitar Hero, I mean, just taking
6143000	6145000	the whole Beatles thing out of it, doesn't
6145000	6147000	Guitar Hero usually tend to beat Rock Band
6147000	6149000	on sales chart? Well
6149000	6151000	it depends who you're asking because
6151000	6153000	they
6153000	6155000	say, yeah, we've sold more units, well yeah
6155000	6157000	you have like five times as many
6157000	6159000	games coming out, so yes, you've sold
6159000	6161000	more units, I see, but
6161000	6163000	so you can't really
6163000	6165000	trust those numbers
6165000	6167000	I mean, look at, you know, even the Guitar Hero
6167000	6169000	platform, you've still got two more games coming out
6169000	6171000	this year in Guitar
6171000	6173000	well, Band Hero, but come on
6173000	6175000	it's Guitar Hero, it's just E10, you know
6175000	6177000	and then Van Halen
6177000	6179000	you know, that's still coming out too, so
6179000	6181000	it's a little
6181000	6183000	oversaturation right now
6183000	6185000	Hmm, interesting
6185000	6187000	comment from xlink in chatroom on a
6187000	6189000	related topic, says, I do
6189000	6191000	if you look at the box office
6191000	6193000	Saw VI got the
6193000	6195000	number two spot
6195000	6197000	too much can be an overkill, and that's a good
6197000	6199000	point is that, you know, maybe the saturation
6199000	6201000	of Guitar Hero is starting to catch up to him
6201000	6203000	because, you know, I think
6203000	6205000	a lot of us, at least me, I never like the
6205000	6207000	Saw movies really to begin with, but I especially look at
6207000	6209000	Saw VI and go, enough already!
6209000	6211000	It was actually pretty good
6211000	6213000	Did you go see it? Yeah! Really?
6213000	6215000	I didn't like
6215000	6217000	the last few because it's just hard to follow what's going on
6217000	6219000	but this one actually took place after the last movie
6219000	6221000	you know, Chronology, which
6221000	6223000	is awesome, and it kind of explained a lot of things
6223000	6225000	and I thought it was actually pretty decent
6225000	6227000	Hmm, but it got, do you know
6227000	6229000	what it got beat by? Did it explain why people like it?
6229000	6231000	Where the Wild Things Are, I'm guessing
6231000	6233000	No, it got beat by a little indie title
6233000	6235000	that has made it big called Paranormal Activity
6235000	6237000	I want to see that
6237000	6239000	Was the number one movie
6239000	6241000	I actually get to see that for free pretty soon
6241000	6243000	We're having a screening
6243000	6245000	Well that movie's made a lot of
6245000	6247000	buzz based off of the internet and Twitter
6247000	6249000	and the way, it's the very, it's Blair
6249000	6251000	You know, funny enough, we're ten years
6251000	6253000	believe it or not, after the Blair Witch Project
6253000	6255000	which is a very similar kind of marketing
6255000	6257000	although technology's changed in the past ten years
6257000	6259000	but Paranormal Activity is sort of
6259000	6261000	2009's Blair Witch Project in a way
6261000	6263000	They're marketing it like a Wii
6263000	6265000	Whereas, you know, we're not gonna put it out everywhere
6265000	6267000	and you're gonna hear how awesome this movie is
6267000	6269000	and you're gonna be like, I wish I could see it
6269000	6271000	but it's not in my town and then we're gonna
6271000	6273000	flood the market with it and then
6273000	6275000	everyone goes and sees it
6275000	6277000	So that's what they did this weekend
6277000	6279000	ActDeftInChat says, enough is enough
6279000	6281000	I've had it with these motherfucking
6281000	6283000	saws in my motherfucking movies
6283000	6285000	And that apparently
6285000	6287000	might be what some people are saying about Guitar Hero
6287000	6289000	I don't know, interestingly enough
6289000	6291000	I'm more interested in
6291000	6293000	Guitar Hero 5
6293000	6295000	than I have been in a Guitar Hero
6295000	6297000	game in a while, and I think Band Hero
6297000	6299000	was needed, you know what I mean
6299000	6301000	For that other audience
6301000	6303000	I kind of look at this and go
6303000	6305000	Activision
6305000	6307000	isn't doing anything wrong this year
6307000	6309000	except for the fact that maybe
6309000	6311000	they just put out too much
6311000	6313000	Really? Here's what comes out
6313000	6315000	Here's what comes down too
6315000	6317000	I don't think the Van Halen game was needed
6317000	6319000	I think in the Metallica game and all this other stuff
6319000	6321000	You don't need to buy them
6321000	6323000	But Guitar Hero fans do buy them
6323000	6325000	And the reason you keep putting them out
6325000	6327000	is because you keep buying them
6327000	6329000	I guess it's more of a sure thing
6329000	6331000	for them to put out a new
6331000	6333000	Guitar Hero game every once in a while
6333000	6335000	sell it for $60
6335000	6337000	and make that
6337000	6339000	kind of money back versus trying to
6339000	6341000	gamble on download content
6341000	6343000	which they do a little bit, but it's nowhere
6343000	6345000	near what Rock Band's doing
6345000	6347000	Quick question chat and then we'll get into the next story
6347000	6349000	XLink asks, speaking of SAW
6349000	6351000	basically, how many people have bought
6351000	6353000	SAW the video game? Any idea
6353000	6355000	Lowkey? How that game's moving?
6355000	6357000	The SAW video game?
6357000	6359000	I don't know, but I can
6359000	6361000	find out
6361000	6363000	That brings us to the next story
6363000	6365000	If we can move on there and then we'll
6365000	6367000	figure that out later
6367000	6369000	Well, for people who are playing Marvel Ultimate Alliance 2
6369000	6371000	there actually is a future
6371000	6373000	character coming up
6373000	6375000	for download
6375000	6377000	is Cable
6377000	6379000	Right now he's an NPC, but he will be
6379000	6381000	downloadable to be playable
6381000	6383000	I guess that's a pay to unlock type of thing
6383000	6385000	and
6385000	6387000	yeah, I hope he's
6387000	6389000	he's not, you know
6389000	6391000	overly imbalanced
6391000	6393000	but also
6393000	6395000	for more missions, there's a Psylocke mission
6395000	6397000	coming out too, which will be pretty cool
6401000	6403000	Have you played the Ultimate Alliance game yet?
6403000	6405000	The new one?
6405000	6407000	No, it's still sitting right here on my desk
6407000	6409000	Hopefully one day your hand will be all patched up
6409000	6411000	and you can
6411000	6413000	get into that, because I'm kind of curious
6413000	6415000	what the Marvel fans think of that one
6415000	6417000	Couple more stories. Oh, did you find the SAW video game?
6417000	6419000	Yes, I did. I'm just pulling up
6419000	6421000	PlayStation 3 numbers right now
6421000	6423000	For the Xbox 360
6423000	6425000	it sold
6425000	6427000	.03 million units
6427000	6429000	so that would be like
6429000	6431000	30,000 copies? Wow
6431000	6433000	Yeah
6433000	6435000	Yeah, 30,000 copies, granted
6435000	6437000	I mean, that's not great
6437000	6439000	it only came out a couple weeks ago
6439000	6441000	and this is only showing in the first two weeks
6441000	6443000	but
6443000	6445000	it has dropped in half versus
6445000	6447000	week one, week two. Maybe it'll bump up again
6447000	6449000	with the new movie out and everything
6449000	6451000	Halloween and all that
6451000	6453000	Maybe
6453000	6455000	PlayStation 3 version sold only
6455000	6457000	20,000 units, so 50,000 total
6457000	6459000	but once again
6459000	6461000	I bring up the point
6461000	6463000	these publishers are putting out games that are only selling
6463000	6465000	under 100,000 units or whatever
6465000	6467000	President Cat
6467000	6469000	could do quite well over here
6469000	6471000	I mean, if their expectations
6471000	6473000	are just to sell maybe a few 100,000
6473000	6475000	units, if that, or even
6475000	6477000	100,000 units
6477000	6479000	it's easy on the Wii
6479000	6481000	easy to do that
6481000	6483000	Out of curiosity, and I apologize because I know we don't have the answer
6483000	6485000	right in front of you, but how does this compare to Silent Hill
6485000	6487000	Homecoming? Because I know at one point they were talking
6487000	6489000	about Saw was supposed
6489000	6491000	to be like Konami's new series
6491000	6493000	that I guess
6493000	6495000	was going to co-exist with Silent Hill
6495000	6497000	but you kind of get the weird feeling, are they going to try and replace
6497000	6499000	Silent Hill with Saw? But
6499000	6501000	Silent Hill Homecoming kind of took a lot of crap
6501000	6503000	from the reviewers
6503000	6505000	and the fact
6505000	6507000	that they just outright cancelled the game
6507000	6509000	for Japan, which kind of says something
6509000	6511000	about their faith in the game as it is
6511000	6513000	I don't think the game was terrible by any means
6513000	6515000	you know, it's different from the other games, you could tell it was developed
6515000	6517000	somewhere else, but I don't think it was bad at all
6517000	6519000	Well, let's see, in comparison
6519000	6521000	for example, the
6521000	6523000	Xbox 360 version now
6523000	6525000	of Saw only sold 20,000
6525000	6527000	units in the first week
6527000	6529000	the Xbox 360 version of Silent Hill
6529000	6531000	sold 47,000
6531000	6533000	units in the first week
6533000	6535000	Okay, there you go
6535000	6537000	So, you know, about
6537000	6539000	almost 30,000 more units
6539000	6541000	and then continued to sell
6541000	6543000	and still continuing to sell
6543000	6545000	but, you know, once again
6545000	6547000	it's a little early to see, but
6547000	6549000	granted games normally don't peak back
6549000	6551000	up again, it's just normally either
6551000	6553000	consistent or it starts to
6553000	6555000	degrade and it didn't start
6555000	6557000	that high to begin with, so it may sell
6557000	6559000	I'm guessing probably in its lifetime
6559000	6561000	it will probably sell
6561000	6563000	maybe 100,000
6563000	6565000	units on the Xbox
6565000	6567000	360, probably combined
6567000	6569000	I'd say it's gonna sell maybe
6569000	6571000	150,000, both platforms
6571000	6573000	so
6573000	6575000	And you don't just pull these numbers out of your ass
6575000	6577000	I mean, you do a little bit, but
6577000	6579000	keep in mind, for those that may not have listened to the show before
6579000	6581000	Loki, you work in distribution, so
6581000	6583000	you have a pretty good thumbprint on, you know
6583000	6585000	who's ordering what
6585000	6587000	I'm still looking at, there's a website, VGCharts
6587000	6589000	that pulls stuff from NPD
6589000	6591000	numbers, so I'm looking at what the actual
6591000	6593000	numbers were each week
6593000	6595000	Silent Hill on PS3 sold
6595000	6597000	41,000 units in the first week
6597000	6599000	versus the 20 that sold
6599000	6601000	you know
6601000	6603000	not even 20, you know
6603000	6605000	probably like 15
6605000	6607000	for Saw, so
6607000	6609000	Complete random ass question I'm gonna put out there
6609000	6611000	and maybe you don't even know the answer to this, but
6611000	6613000	is there any highly anticipated
6613000	6615000	game coming out this season
6615000	6617000	that you're just noticing is not
6617000	6619000	selling? That you're just not selling
6619000	6621000	copies of it? I'm not selling copies
6621000	6623000	of it
6623000	6625000	I was surprised
6625000	6627000	that people aren't jumping on
6627000	6629000	DJ Hero as much as I thought they would
6629000	6631000	but I can understand that because it's
6631000	6633000	120 dollars
6633000	6635000	Tony Hawk's Bride, not doing well
6635000	6637000	you know, once
6637000	6639000	again, because it's 120 dollars
6639000	6641000	and it's a Tony Hawk game, I'd say like
6641000	6643000	standard priced game that's not doing well
6647000	6649000	I'm putting you on the spot a little bit, I'm sorry
6649000	6651000	Rabbids Go Home isn't doing very well
6651000	6653000	not a lot of people are picking that up in large
6653000	6655000	quantities like the other Rabbids games
6655000	6657000	they're kind of getting a warning
6657000	6659000	I guess they're
6659000	6661000	they've worn out their welcome
6661000	6663000	I would say maybe
6667000	6669000	oh man
6669000	6671000	I had to beg and plead for
6671000	6673000	Demon Souls
6673000	6675000	and then everybody after the fact was scrambling
6675000	6677000	for that, I'm like dude I told you
6677000	6679000	you should have listened to me
6679000	6681000	so is that game actually moving now?
6681000	6683000	oh yeah it's moving, they're sold out at Atlas
6683000	6685000	I mean they keep selling out
6685000	6687000	so it's doing
6687000	6689000	it's probably the fastest moving
6689000	6691000	Atlas title I've seen
6691000	6693000	some of the smaller niche titles
6693000	6695000	even like Muramasa don't do
6695000	6697000	as well right off the bat
6697000	6699000	they hear all the buzz and it's like
6699000	6701000	there's people coming in asking for this, I need this right away
6701000	6703000	so it's not a surprise
6703000	6705000	but
6705000	6707000	I'd say probably this fall
6707000	6709000	the one title that's not going to do as well
6709000	6711000	as the company's hoping
6711000	6713000	I'm guessing would be Avatar
6713000	6715000	I don't think that's going to do that well
6715000	6717000	oh the one based on the movie?
6717000	6719000	I think that movie's going to bomb
6719000	6721000	I think that movie's going to be a big fucking bomb
6721000	6723000	I'm not knocking it, it actually looks
6723000	6725000	kind of neat, but I just think it's going to be
6725000	6727000	one of those movies that is
6727000	6729000	especially considering the hype is too high
6729000	6731000	I think that movie's going to bomb
6731000	6733000	of course watch me be wrong
6733000	6735000	who knows
6735000	6737000	well this is something that may not sell a lot
6737000	6739000	but I think this looks freaking phenomenal
6739000	6741000	do you guys know what a Microsoft
6741000	6743000	I know one, and this is really sad
6743000	6745000	Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles
6745000	6747000	The Crystal Bearers, that's a tough sell
6747000	6749000	no one wants to buy it because the last one was a port
6749000	6751000	of a DS title and everybody hated it
6751000	6753000	and so they're like oh Crystal Chronicles
6753000	6755000	I'm not bringing that shit in
6755000	6757000	well I want to show you guys
6757000	6759000	a little bit of this, how many of you guys know what a Microsoft
6759000	6761000	Surface is?
6761000	6763000	aren't those like the giant
6763000	6765000	tables, like we saw one at Penny Arcade
6765000	6767000	yeah we played with the Google Maps on there
6767000	6769000	yeah, us and Bobby were kind of like
6769000	6771000	we were giving each other tours of our neighborhoods
6771000	6773000	on the Microsoft Surface on the Google Maps
6773000	6775000	I took you guys to Alabama, that's right
6775000	6777000	the Surface tables are a lot of fun, it's like a gigantic
6777000	6779000	iPhone, which is probably
6779000	6781000	not what Microsoft would want me to call it
6781000	6783000	I don't know what it is, well I gotta say
6783000	6785000	this looks rad
6785000	6787000	this is a little game called Surfacecapes
6787000	6789000	and they're calling it a proof of concept
6789000	6791000	project, it is using
6791000	6793000	the Microsoft Surface table to play
6793000	6795000	Dungeons and Dragons essentially
6795000	6797000	it's using the Surface table
6797000	6799000	get this, you can actually plot out little pieces
6799000	6801000	on the map, and they actually show you
6801000	6803000	a little tour of this, you can put pieces on the grid
6803000	6805000	so you can actually, you know how like people get out
6805000	6807000	their big charts and their pen and paper
6807000	6809000	to move characters around, imagine
6809000	6811000	being able to do all that on the Surface, and look at that
6811000	6813000	D20 flying in that you can actually roll there
6813000	6815000	virtually, and you can't cheat
6815000	6817000	you can do that virtually
6817000	6819000	there on the Microsoft Surface, and you can actually
6819000	6821000	move these little pieces around
6821000	6823000	now this is going to make the nerds
6823000	6825000	want to have one of these in their home, I think this is
6825000	6827000	pretty cool, having this, this is
6827000	6829000	just a proof of concept for right now
6829000	6831000	but I think a lot of people have looked at these
6831000	6833000	Surfaces going, what do you do with it?
6833000	6835000	like there's not a lot
6835000	6837000	to do here, but this is
6837000	6839000	really expensive too
6839000	6841000	oh I'm sure, I mean I've never seen one
6841000	6843000	outside of that one hotel, and it seems
6843000	6845000	like that's where you're going to see them, is like in
6845000	6847000	the lobbies of hotels for people
6847000	6849000	to find like coffee shops and
6849000	6851000	expensive restaurants they want to
6851000	6853000	go to and so forth
6853000	6855000	Salaciouspopnchat says some casinos in Vegas are starting
6855000	6857000	to use it, yeah I can see that too
6857000	6859000	Redertainment says Microsoft Surface is a
6859000	6861000	cool thing to play around with, it's
6861000	6863000	like watching TV while high without
6863000	6865000	actually being high
6865000	6867000	it certainly is
6867000	6869000	something a little different, it's
6869000	6871000	a cool little device, I think it just might be a little ahead of
6871000	6873000	its time, like it's not the kind of thing people are going to have
6873000	6875000	in their homes, you're not going to be replacing your
6875000	6877000	coffee table with the Surface at any time soon
6877000	6879000	I will, but then again I don't have a coffee table
6879000	6881000	yeah don't, don't spill a drink
6881000	6883000	on it though or you're fucked, I mean that's the
6883000	6885000	other nervous thing about it, of course
6885000	6887000	then again, I've dropped my iPhone I don't know
6887000	6889000	how many times and it still works, but I also put a
6889000	6891000	protective case on it, so
6891000	6893000	I've dropped mine on concrete
6893000	6895000	and it hasn't broken, and I don't have a case
6895000	6897000	on mine, wow
6897000	6899000	see I have a big thick case on mine
6899000	6901000	because when I got my iPhone I said, okay
6901000	6903000	I know this guy is going to get dropped
6903000	6905000	so I need to figure out a case I can put
6905000	6907000	on it, wow you don't even have a protective screen on it
6907000	6909000	do you, that's pretty amazing
6909000	6911000	nope, wow, look at the back of it
6911000	6913000	that's not bad at all, but then again
6913000	6915000	here's the silver, I didn't even know they made them
6915000	6917000	the original ones, I have an old school
6917000	6919000	iPhone, interesting
6919000	6921000	which I'm going to auction off when I get
6921000	6923000	my 3GS for a holiday
6923000	6925000	I think those things are pretty waterproof
6925000	6927000	because it looks like, you know, they have a picture
6927000	6929000	like a fancy picture, it looks like someone
6929000	6931000	in a casino, they have their
6931000	6933000	drinks set on it, I think that because
6933000	6935000	the monitor is actually so inside of it
6935000	6937000	you know, and the table
6937000	6939000	goes way beyond the actual monitor
6939000	6941000	if you spilled something on it it would just drip over the edge
6941000	6943000	one more comment from Redertainment
6943000	6945000	NBC News used Surface during their
6945000	6947000	2008 election coverage, yeah
6947000	6949000	and also that probably has a lot
6949000	6951000	to do with Microsoft and NBC
6951000	6953000	collaborating on a lot of stuff, I mean
6953000	6955000	MSNBC, hello, but then, you know
6955000	6957000	I like
6957000	6959000	watching election year coverage because that's
6959000	6961000	when all the channels try to roll out their new technology
6961000	6963000	to get you to watch them, remember when CNN
6963000	6965000	did the holograms
6965000	6967000	like the most pointless thing ever
6967000	6969000	it was just like a cool technology to show
6969000	6971000	off, so
6971000	6973000	Amanda giving us a warning in chat
6973000	6975000	I dropped my iPhone the other night
6975000	6977000	and totally cracked the screen
6977000	6979000	I don't know how many times I dropped it
6979000	6981000	before and it had been fine, Dan did
6981000	6983000	his first time, he got his, he cracked it in his
6983000	6985000	pocket, so careful, careful folks
6985000	6987000	yeah, I don't think I'll be buying one of these
6987000	6989000	they're $12,000
6989000	6991000	or $12,500
6991000	6993000	but you know
6993000	6995000	like in five years
6995000	6997000	that price, remember when HDTVs
6997000	6999000	were $8,000, I'm sorry, it's still way too damn
6999000	7001000	expensive, you get an HDTV, put a
7001000	7003000	nice touchscreen interface on it
7003000	7005000	Surface, done, I mean you don't really
7005000	7007000	I don't understand why this stuff's so expensive
7007000	7009000	it's not $12,000 unit
7009000	7011000	I mean, come on
7011000	7013000	Salacious Pop was just asking as we were talking about it on air
7013000	7015000	cause there's a little delay, LOL, what channel did
7015000	7017000	the Princess Leia shit
7017000	7019000	that's a great way to describe what CNN did that year
7019000	7021000	and Redertainment follows up with
7021000	7023000	Wolf Blitzer
7023000	7025000	I am your father
7025000	7027000	love it, so wrong, funny, funny, funny
7027000	7029000	I don't know if you happened to catch the soup
7029000	7031000	this week, they had a thing, no, I stopped
7031000	7033000	watching that show, not that, I love Joel McHale
7033000	7035000	I just always forget to TV
7035000	7037000	they had a funny quote, it was a show
7037000	7039000	about celebrities that saw ghosts
7039000	7041000	or something, but she was talking about
7041000	7043000	her friend or something that
7043000	7045000	he's a gay Republican who's a
7045000	7047000	drug addict or something like that, but the way she said it
7047000	7049000	was hilarious, sounds like my ex
7049000	7051000	oh, snap, alright, snap
7051000	7053000	alright, I was just thinking it only
7053000	7055000	I had the tact to not say it aloud, awe
7055000	7057000	let's see
7057000	7059000	really random topic, and then we're gonna get it into
7059000	7061000	the mailbag, your email's at
7061000	7063000	orangelessradio.com, DarkSakura will read here in a moment
7063000	7065000	but I'm gonna throw out this completely random
7065000	7067000	question from chat, it's like
7067000	7069000	throw random questions at Loki night, I swear
7069000	7071000	Deekman is asking, Loki
7071000	7073000	did you see this announcement that a custom
7073000	7075000	firmware for the PSP 3000 is supposed to be
7075000	7077000	released next week
7077000	7079000	that's like every week, I mean
7079000	7081000	I'm sorry, like, which custom
7081000	7083000	firmware, who's making it, what
7083000	7085000	is it, I haven't even bothered to look
7085000	7087000	just because I'm so sick
7087000	7089000	and tired of, like, I got to the
7089000	7091000	point where you can convert
7091000	7093000	some games to run with certain other
7093000	7095000	firmwares and stuff
7095000	7097000	alright, I'm gonna
7097000	7099000	go look at this
7099000	7101000	alright, you look it up, in the mean time
7101000	7103000	DarkSakura's gonna dive into the mailbag
7103000	7105000	mailbag at orangelessradio.com
7105000	7107000	and read your emails
7107000	7109000	cause, dang it, you send us emails
7109000	7111000	and show us a little love, so we show you
7111000	7113000	some love back in a little segment we call the mailbag
7113000	7115000	alright, um
7115000	7117000	hi LLR, thanks for reading my
7117000	7119000	twitter question that's upon playing
7119000	7121000	on the short show about the
7121000	7123000	official Konami DDR tournament
7123000	7125000	following up on it, I was wondering what you guys
7125000	7127000	thought about the age restrictions on Konami's
7127000	7129000	official DDR tournament, I have enclosed a snippet
7129000	7131000	about it on the official summary
7131000	7133000	all registrants must be between the ages of 13
7133000	7135000	and 32 years as of
7135000	7137000	April 1, 2009
7137000	7139000	according to these rules, I actually would be
7139000	7141000	ineligible to compete next year if there was another
7141000	7143000	tournament, I'm not sure what
7143000	7145000	to think, maybe they
7145000	7147000	are thinking someone hits 32 they fall apart
7147000	7149000	anyway, give it the good work
7149000	7151000	peace out and triple A
7151000	7153000	that's from uh
7153000	7155000	Jammer J
7155000	7157000	I think that's stupid
7157000	7159000	it's incredibly stupid and kind of
7159000	7161000	insulting, especially to the fanbase that kind of
7161000	7163000	helped DDR get big, but this is
7163000	7165000	exactly why I had no idea
7165000	7167000	about this until you mentioned it, because guess what
7167000	7169000	I stopped following it, so maybe that's why
7169000	7171000	I'm not allowed to participate
7171000	7173000	next year I will be able to participate
7173000	7175000	I was 32 April 1, 2009
7175000	7177000	I know, I know
7177000	7179000	it's ridiculous
7179000	7181000	I mean, it
7181000	7183000	whatever, if you want to
7183000	7185000	alienate some of your potential fans
7185000	7187000	that way, go for it, whatever
7189000	7191000	ugh, I need a new nose, Rob
7191000	7193000	I'm kind of, it's weird
7193000	7195000	I am and I'm not over the DDR
7195000	7197000	thing, like some days I go
7197000	7199000	I'm so done with DDR, like it's just
7199000	7201000	not cool anymore, but then I go
7201000	7203000	I kind of want that new one on the 360 PS3
7203000	7205000	it looks kind of awesome, my sheet metal
7205000	7207000	came in the other day
7207000	7209000	you know what that's for, right?
7209000	7211000	I know, for your little DDR project
7211000	7213000	and, but you're still in your 20s
7213000	7215000	so whatever, oh whatever
7215000	7217000	I mean, barely, oh god
7217000	7219000	you young whippersnapper
7219000	7221000	in your DDR mat
7221000	7223000	listen, okay, I went
7223000	7225000	so far as getting official
7225000	7227000	Konami
7227000	7229000	stickers from the arcade machine that are gonna
7229000	7231000	go on this thing, I mean that's how
7231000	7233000	awesome it's gonna look
7233000	7235000	well how do you feel that in, you know, 4 years or whatever
7235000	7237000	you're dead to Konami
7237000	7239000	Dead Man Walking, Dead Man Dancing
7239000	7241000	I don't buy their games
7241000	7243000	oh, maybe that should be the next game that comes out
7243000	7245000	it's like Zombies Ate My Neighbors combined with DDR, Dead Man Dancing
7245000	7247000	dude, I have a way to fix their whole franchise
7247000	7249000	but no, let's add 8 arrows
7249000	7251000	to it, that'll be awesome
7251000	7253000	oh, well, are we actually gonna do step charts
7253000	7255000	that support those 8 arrows?
7255000	7257000	no, we're just gonna use some programs
7257000	7259000	to integrate these arrows for you
7259000	7261000	that's awesome, because that works so well with quads
7263000	7265000	yeah, over DDR, sorry
7265000	7267000	which is just a scam to get you to buy
7267000	7269000	you know, more dance mats
7269000	7271000	I know we have a lot of listeners
7271000	7273000	that are still attached to the music games
7273000	7275000	and yes, we founded the station on it
7275000	7277000	but I guess, you know, now that some of us are
7277000	7279000	getting that 32 threshold, I guess we are officially
7279000	7281000	too old for DDR
7281000	7283000	well, here's the other thing too, I mean, look at their game releases
7283000	7285000	for DDR, they're not doing
7285000	7287000	game only releases
7287000	7289000	not until like, way later on
7289000	7291000	so if you wanna really stick with DDR
7291000	7293000	and buy a new release each year, guess what
7293000	7295000	you're gonna get a soft mat to go with that release
7295000	7297000	and it's gonna be $10 more than they would normally be
7297000	7299000	by itself
7299000	7301000	however, I will say this
7301000	7303000	if Beatmania 2DX or whatever goes to PlayStation 3
7303000	7305000	I'm very interested in what's next
7305000	7307000	for that franchise, because I've always loved Beatmania
7307000	7309000	well, if it goes to the PlayStation 3, you can import that shit
7309000	7311000	ooh, I didn't even think of that
7311000	7313000	good point, my man, good point
7313000	7315000	anyhow
7315000	7317000	more emails, sorry
7317000	7319000	sorry, I'm kind of feeling like crap right now
7319000	7327000	this one is a Kingdom Hearts 358 two day mini review
7327000	7331000	it's like, well I'm saying this because you guys probably aren't gonna play the game
7331000	7335000	so I thought that writing a review would help motivate you guys to buy it or at least rent it
7335000	7337000	I beat it in a week, dude, please use punctuation
7337000	7339000	and capitalize your thing, cause
7339000	7341000	I saw a commercial for the game on TV today
7341000	7343000	just random thought
7343000	7345000	I never made it through the first game
7345000	7347000	or played the second game
7347000	7349000	or played the DS game
7349000	7351000	I glitched my second game
7351000	7353000	or played the PlayStation 2 port of the Gameboy Advance game
7353000	7355000	so I'm so lost in it right now
7355000	7359000	that I just am not gonna even bother
7359000	7361000	I'm gonna sum this up
7361000	7363000	you play as Roxas
7363000	7365000	and he gives it an 8
7365000	7367000	so like, I don't even know who Roxas is
7367000	7369000	I mean, I know who he is
7369000	7371000	but this character means nothing to me
7371000	7373000	re-write your review with proper grammar
7373000	7375000	and spelling and everything
7375000	7377000	and I'll put it up on the site
7377000	7379000	I do love the Kingdom Hearts games
7379000	7381000	but I'm just not interested in these handheld ones
7381000	7383000	and this all goes back to my whole
7383000	7385000	I'm just not as big of a fan of handheld games
7385000	7387000	as I am playing them on my big TV
7387000	7389000	so I'll wait until the next
7389000	7391000	big official Kingdom Hearts 3
7391000	7393000	comes out and leave all these side stories
7393000	7395000	on the side
7395000	7397000	alright, this one comes from
7397000	7399000	AZHP
7427000	7429000	gross
7443000	7447000	most of those stores are franchised anyway
7447000	7449000	so
7449000	7451000	well, they closed one not far from here
7451000	7453000	the one that was in the Target lot closed
7453000	7455000	yeah, but I don't work over there
7455000	7457000	but, you know
7457000	7459000	they're not all doing great
7459000	7461000	mmmkay
7461000	7463000	ooh, we got an angry letter
7463000	7465000	angry letter
7465000	7467000	I love angry emails, yay
7467000	7469000	and thankfully I sound like crap now
7469000	7471000	dear OLR
7471000	7473000	I listened to the podcast of the October 18th show
7473000	7475000	and was honestly astounded at what I heard
7475000	7477000	upon reflection, what did I expect to come out of the mouths of people
7477000	7479000	who live in the liberal enclave
7479000	7481000	that is California
7481000	7483000	how can you stand behind the possible presidency
7483000	7485000	of Cat?
7485000	7487000	Cat has little foreign animal experience
7487000	7489000	and no executive experience
7489000	7491000	and likes the coherent strategy to deal with the growing threat
7491000	7493000	presented by radical fundamental fleas
7493000	7495000	I even doubt that Cat
7495000	7497000	is even from this country
7497000	7499000	I heard that Cat is a Persian
7499000	7501000	any rational person knows that the true
7501000	7503000	and correct choice for president is Dog
7503000	7505000	Dog has expressed his bath-based
7505000	7507000	strategy for dealing with threat of fleas
7507000	7509000	once and for all
7509000	7511000	Dog has a steady paw and is loyal to our
7511000	7513000	president, President Burrow
7513000	7515000	yes, Dog has
7515000	7517000	chased cars in the past, but after accepting
7517000	7519000	Jesus as his lord and master
7519000	7521000	I can assure you that Dog will never chase cars again
7521000	7523000	when you step into the gaming
7523000	7525000	arena on Tuesday, remember who is
7525000	7527000	stuck by you like a loyal friend who treats you
7527000	7529000	like you are its pet
7529000	7531000	and not the dominant person you are
7531000	7533000	vote for Dog for president
7533000	7535000	do it or the fleas win
7535000	7537000	thanks for letting me listen from the conservative Eden that is Utah
7537000	7539000	Reddertainment
7539000	7541000	Dog has been brought to you by Glenn Beck
7541000	7543000	a smart, rational, and insane voice for the future
7543000	7545000	if that isn't proof that I'm clearly kidding
7545000	7547000	what else can I say?
7547000	7549000	Well, I'd have to say that Dog has been
7549000	7551000	known to eat poop
7551000	7553000	and honestly, Dog thinks
7553000	7555000	I threw something when I just faked them out
7555000	7557000	so I don't really know if I can trust
7557000	7559000	Dog to
7559000	7561000	you know, not drool
7561000	7563000	on the issues
7563000	7565000	I can rely on Cat to be self-sufficient
7565000	7567000	except for Shermy, who is just fat and lean
7567000	7569000	Cat has eaten hair
7569000	7571000	so, you know, that's not as bad as poop
7571000	7573000	but still, both candidates have their flaws
7573000	7575000	Reddertainment, you ignorant slut
7575000	7577000	no, I'm just kidding
7577000	7579000	actually, that was like the email of the century
7579000	7581000	loved it
7581000	7583000	Gold Star for you, sir
7583000	7585000	I think that is worthy of the Gold Star
7585000	7587000	email bag segment recipient
7587000	7589000	wouldn't you agree, DarkSakura?
7589000	7591000	Was proper grammar and punctuation all that used?
7591000	7593000	So there you go, Gold Star recipient
7593000	7595000	applause to you
7595000	7597000	I closed the fanfare
7597000	7599000	There's your fanfare
7601000	7603000	Well done there, Rob
7603000	7605000	Thank you
7605000	7607000	Does my fanfare get a Gold Star?
7607000	7609000	Your fanfare gets a
7609000	7611000	My god, you're like
7611000	7613000	really sick over there, aren't you?
7613000	7615000	It's the dust in the room
7615000	7617000	What's the dust in the room?
7617000	7619000	No, I opened up my old
7619000	7621000	laptop case to try to find my SD card
7621000	7623000	reader and it kicked up
7623000	7625000	a crap ton of dust
7625000	7627000	So, yeah
7627000	7629000	All we are is dust in the room
7629000	7631000	That's the official campaign
7631000	7633000	song, by the way, of President Cat
7633000	7635000	Not really
7635000	7637000	Is that it for emails tonight?
7637000	7639000	Mailbag at Orange Lounge Radio
7639000	7641000	That's all I'm fucking reading
7641000	7643000	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com
7643000	7645000	if you want to send your email
7645000	7647000	for possible reading
7647000	7649000	on the air next week
7649000	7651000	How much of that is getting picked up by the mics?
7651000	7653000	Probably a lot
7653000	7655000	I don't care, my nose feels
7655000	7657000	like crap
7657000	7659000	Hey, we want to get into the FUs of the week
7659000	7661000	actually, before we get back into
7661000	7663000	the little show here
7663000	7665000	and the news stories
7665000	7667000	No story to inspire
7667000	7669000	our FUs of the week tonight
7669000	7671000	I have a story
7671000	7673000	I hate my nose, that's the story
7673000	7685000	of the media
7685000	7687000	This is fucked up
7687000	7689000	FU to my nose
7689000	7691000	and dust
7691000	7693000	and did I mention
7693000	7695000	my nose? Because FU to my
7695000	7697000	fucking nose and the fucking dust
7697000	7699000	FU to people
7699000	7701000	that have a story about everything
7701000	7703000	and I mean, like, we were watching
7703000	7705000	people on the subway
7705000	7707000	you know, riding Bart this weekend
7707000	7709000	and there was
7709000	7711000	on the way there, a woman who was talking
7711000	7713000	about, you know, for some
7713000	7715000	reason, she was going like
7715000	7717000	oh, I hope you have fun today and that
7717000	7719000	turned into like, yeah, my daughter
7719000	7721000	went to this convention and she got
7721000	7723000	to see Miley Cyrus and blah blah blah
7723000	7725000	blah blah blah blah blah and it's like, yeah, well
7725000	7727000	you know, my daughter lives
7727000	7729000	in Texas now, oh, and we went to Texas
7729000	7731000	then there was this bum
7731000	7733000	that did the same thing, talking
7733000	7735000	to this blind woman, so not only is she blind
7735000	7737000	she's being berated by this
7737000	7739000	guy who says he's rich, but yet
7739000	7741000	has a bag full of cans with him
7741000	7743000	so that's bullshit
7743000	7745000	Maybe he's into recycling
7745000	7747000	Maybe he's rich in cans
7747000	7749000	because cans is the new currency
7749000	7751000	Yeah, I'm under
7751000	7753000	the regime of President Cat
7753000	7755000	But he, Catnip
7755000	7757000	is the new currency
7757000	7759000	But, it's just, these
7759000	7761000	people though, just annoy
7761000	7763000	the hell out of me, that like, try to one up
7763000	7765000	everybody's stories and stuff like that, you know
7765000	7767000	how they have, you know, oh yeah
7767000	7769000	my cousin lives there, and oh
7769000	7771000	I went there and did sheet metal work
7771000	7773000	and oh, and my dog was
7773000	7775000	from that country and stuff, and like
7775000	7777000	Is there a character like that on Saturday Night Live?
7777000	7779000	Yes, there is. Alright, yeah, yeah, yeah
7779000	7781000	I had ten baby cows
7781000	7783000	I can't believe Logan
7783000	7785000	just did a great impression of that
7785000	7787000	we do impressions
7787000	7789000	of that woman all the time
7789000	7791000	especially when we see people like this
7791000	7793000	and we were doing that too, like while she was talking
7793000	7795000	and I was like
7795000	7797000	and yeah, and then we had Miley Cyrus follow us
7797000	7799000	and we were like making fun of her the entire day
7799000	7801000	and Miley Cyrus followed us, right?
7801000	7803000	and she was playing music for us
7803000	7805000	and then, uh
7805000	7807000	then we went to our house on the moon
7807000	7809000	and Miley Cyrus followed us
7809000	7811000	because she's our slave
7811000	7813000	so yeah
7813000	7815000	I hate people who have served better
7815000	7817000	oh god
7817000	7819000	I can't follow that up, that's amazing
7819000	7821000	um, I guess my only F.U. would
7821000	7823000	go to stress
7823000	7825000	because I have quite a lot of it at work right now
7825000	7827000	but, you know, it happens
7827000	7829000	and F.U. did the fact that I haven't updated
7829000	7831000	LiveJournal in like three weeks
7831000	7833000	like I'm seriously falling behind on that stuff
7833000	7835000	and uh, yeah
7835000	7837000	I don't like feeling behind
7837000	7839000	on my life
7839000	7841000	Kristen Wiig, that's, oh yeah, she's
7841000	7843000	like the only woman on that show right now, isn't she?
7843000	7845000	Did they ever fire the one that dropped
7845000	7847000	the F-bomb on air?
7847000	7849000	Who was that? Some new chick
7849000	7851000	remember like her first show, like she dropped
7851000	7853000	the F-bomb because they gave her a character
7853000	7855000	that said frickin' frickin' frickin' every other word
7855000	7857000	and one time she just slipped and said, fuck it
7857000	7859000	I would have done the same thing
7859000	7861000	I kind of felt bad for her
7861000	7863000	so, anyhow
7863000	7865000	in Reddertainment we like to point out the name of that character is
7865000	7867000	Penelope, the one-upper
7867000	7869000	there you go
7869000	7871000	and the name bless you to Jamie because they can all hear her nose
7871000	7873000	sorry!
7873000	7875000	Thank you everybody, I love you
7875000	7877000	alright, couple more news stories for you guys
7877000	7879000	then the Skype line at 1877-GAME-OLR
7879000	7881000	Loki?
7881000	7883000	Yes, so um
7883000	7885000	personally, I haven't played this game yet
7885000	7887000	I acquired it for my MAME cabinet
7887000	7889000	earlier today, but the game is
7889000	7891000	Toki, it's a
7891000	7893000	2D side-scrolling game starring a
7893000	7895000	ape, and apparently
7895000	7897000	it's getting the HD treatment
7897000	7899000	the French developer
7899000	7901000	Golgoth Studio
7901000	7903000	is taking the game and completely redoing all the graphics
7903000	7905000	and it actually looks pretty cool
7905000	7907000	so I hope the game is fun
7907000	7909000	but it looks like it's all
7909000	7911000	hand-drawn now and
7911000	7913000	I don't know, it's the stuff you would normally
7913000	7915000	expect on box art
7915000	7917000	but
7917000	7919000	it's all in motion now
7919000	7921000	huh
7921000	7923000	but apparently it'll be coming out for games for Windows Live
7923000	7925000	and Xbox Live Arcade
7925000	7927000	so it's not like a
7927000	7929000	full retail game, it's kind of more of a
7929000	7931000	mini-game if it's coming out on Arcade, but it
7931000	7933000	looked kind of neat from the screen
7933000	7935000	it could still be a full game, yeah
7935000	7937000	it looks neat
7937000	7939000	interesting
7939000	7941000	well, here's some games that didn't do so great when they
7941000	7943000	came out, this story kind of caught our attention
7943000	7945000	and I don't like a whole lot of these
7945000	7947000	top 10 kind of lists, but this particular piece
7947000	7949000	on GamesRadar.com, I thought was kind of
7949000	7951000	interesting, they ran a piece earlier this week called
7951000	7953000	18 Awesome Games That Died at Retail
7953000	7955000	and what I thought about reading this
7955000	7957000	list is I wanted to see how many of these
7957000	7959000	games, Jamie being the collector of
7959000	7961000	obscure ass video games, was going to pipe up
7961000	7963000	and say, that game was awesome
7963000	7965000	so we'll see what happens, so Jamie
7965000	7967000	would you like to hear about the 18 awesome
7967000	7969000	games that died at retail? Sure
7969000	7971000	okay, the first one was Metal Arms
7971000	7973000	Glitch in the System, and they
7973000	7975000	say this game didn't do too well just
7975000	7977000	because it was too kitty for serious
7977000	7979000	gamers and vice versa
7979000	7981000	Beyond Good and Evil on
7981000	7983000	the Playstation 2. I think
7983000	7985000	I have that. That's
7985000	7987000	one of those big games on GameTap I think
7987000	7989000	they were really selling that when that first came out
7989000	7991000	again, this is a list from GamesRadar, 18
7991000	7993000	games that died at retail
7993000	7995000	Grand Theft Auto Chinatown War is a
7995000	7997000	more recent game coming out because
7997000	7999000	folks saying there's not enough mature games
7999000	8001000	for the system, but at the same time
8001000	8003000	not enough Nintendo fans wanting mature games
8003000	8005000	Why did this die, Loki?
8005000	8007000	I didn't really
8007000	8009000	care to, you know, I didn't like
8009000	8011000	the way it played just because it was a top
8011000	8013000	down game
8013000	8015000	I prefer more of like the
8015000	8017000	PSP versions and stuff that are
8017000	8019000	more of the 3D stuff you would see on
8019000	8021000	Playstation 2. I understand why they did it that way
8021000	8023000	because the
8023000	8025000	system might not be able to handle that
8025000	8027000	However, now we see that
8027000	8029000	Cop of the Recruit is coming
8029000	8031000	out from Ubisoft and looks like
8031000	8033000	what the Playstation
8033000	8035000	portable versions of Grand Theft Auto were
8035000	8037000	so it is possible to do
8037000	8039000	it that way, but they decided not to
8039000	8041000	I think it will have a better
8041000	8043000	chance on the PSP probably
8043000	8045000	Moving on with the list from GamesRadar.com
8045000	8047000	Psychonauts, of course
8047000	8049000	I'm sure a list like this just wouldn't be complete without
8049000	8051000	Psychonauts. It gets a lot of
8051000	8053000	praise all around. It was something that was
8053000	8055000	originally supposed to be an exclusive for Microsoft
8055000	8057000	but then got killed and brought back and just
8057000	8059000	didn't really have a serious marketing push behind it
8059000	8061000	I know Jamie will get behind
8061000	8063000	this one, Jet Grind Radio on the Dreamcast
8063000	8065000	one of the 18
8065000	8067000	games that tanked here. Unfortunately
8067000	8069000	just being the fact that it was on the Dreamcast
8069000	8071000	console
8071000	8073000	kind of
8073000	8075000	put a damper in it there
8075000	8077000	Metal Storm
8077000	8079000	is on this list. This is an
8079000	8081000	old ass NES side scrolling
8081000	8083000	game like on the old school 8-bit
8083000	8085000	That was pretty sweet too
8085000	8087000	But unfortunately it didn't really
8087000	8089000	sell very well. They're saying
8089000	8091000	it might have something to do with the fact that it was a
8091000	8093000	crappy localization process and
8093000	8095000	the cutscenes were taken out when it was brought
8095000	8097000	over and it screwed with the color palette
8097000	8099000	Shenmue 2
8099000	8101000	on the Xbox
8101000	8103000	I think I have that somewhere
8103000	8105000	Unfortunately this series just kind of
8105000	8107000	never really seemed to catch on. It's one of those things
8107000	8109000	that went later on
8109000	8111000	kind of as a cult status
8113000	8115000	Moving on with this list again from
8115000	8117000	GamesRadar.com. 18 awesome
8117000	8119000	games that died at retail
8119000	8121000	Anything you guys would put on this list that you haven't
8121000	8123000	heard yet? While I'm waiting for the next page
8123000	8125000	to load here
8125000	8127000	Earth Defense Force
8127000	8129000	Oddworld
8129000	8131000	Stranger's Wrath on the
8131000	8133000	Xbox is on the list
8133000	8135000	Armed and Dangerous for the PC
8135000	8137000	Otogi 2
8137000	8139000	Immortal Warriors. I never even heard of
8139000	8141000	this game but it was a Japanese
8141000	8143000	hack and slasher about an ancient swordsman
8143000	8145000	It was a sequel
8145000	8147000	to a game that apparently didn't do too well in the
8147000	8149000	first place. Space Station
8149000	8151000	Silicon Valley on the N64
8151000	8153000	It was kind of a whimsical little
8153000	8155000	platformer robot animal type of game
8155000	8157000	that just got lost in the whole
8157000	8159000	N64 not being one of
8159000	8161000	Nintendo's greatest systems
8161000	8163000	Panzer Dragoon Orta
8163000	8165000	from 2003 is on the list
8165000	8167000	That was a good game
8167000	8169000	The Last Express
8169000	8171000	That was kind of like a stylish
8171000	8173000	game. I remember this game Thief Deadly
8173000	8175000	Shadows on the Xbox
8175000	8177000	did not do too well. I guess maybe that was
8177000	8179000	more of a PC game. I'm not sure
8179000	8181000	Jet Set Radio Future
8181000	8183000	also made the list
8183000	8185000	They say it kind of
8185000	8187000	alienated fans of the first game
8187000	8189000	Bionic Commando on the
8189000	8191000	360 and PS3 I don't think did very well
8191000	8193000	Interesting all things considered
8193000	8195000	Do you think maybe
8195000	8197000	I wonder if the 2D one did better than that
8197000	8199000	Yeah it did a lot better
8199000	8201000	I think because the game kind of
8201000	8203000	I think people were just tied to their memories of the old school
8203000	8205000	game and weren't ready for the whole 3D-ification
8205000	8207000	of it, you know
8207000	8209000	Yeah, there might have been issues with the game
8209000	8211000	Grim Fandango
8211000	8213000	also on the list, getting down towards
8213000	8215000	the end here. The Neverhood
8215000	8217000	from 1996 on the list
8217000	8219000	and last but not least
8219000	8221000	Okami made the list which isn't
8221000	8223000	surprising at all and the reason why
8223000	8225000	Okami kind of got burned, it was out on the
8225000	8227000	Playstation 2 kind of when the next generation
8227000	8229000	of games was already starting and the
8229000	8231000	PS2 was already dying out for a lot of hardcore
8231000	8233000	gamers. I think that was one of the biggest problems with Final Fantasy
8233000	8235000	12, I think it came out too late
8235000	8237000	I think by the time Final Fantasy 12 came out
8237000	8239000	it should have been on the next gen system
8239000	8241000	But that's just me
8241000	8243000	So, alright
8243000	8245000	I guess we're getting to that part of the
8245000	8247000	show where we're going to open up the Skype line
8247000	8249000	and hear from you guys
8249000	8251000	1-877-GAME-OLR is the number you want
8251000	8253000	to call if you want to get on the show or you can just
8253000	8255000	Skype us directly at Orange Lounge Radio
8255000	8257000	I do want to give a little disclaimer first, we've been having
8257000	8259000	problems with Skype the past couple weeks
8259000	8261000	where we've been randomly hanging up on callers
8261000	8263000	We did upgrade to a new version of Skype
8263000	8265000	today, so
8265000	8267000	we're on the latest and greatest version of Skype
8267000	8269000	I'm hoping that we'll fix our problems
8269000	8271000	We hadn't upgraded in a long time
8271000	8273000	I'm hoping that we'll fix our problems, but we don't
8273000	8275000	know what's going to happen, we still may have
8275000	8277000	some issues tonight, so bear with us
8277000	8279000	But again, the number 1-877-GAME-OLR
8279000	8281000	if you want to give us a call
8281000	8283000	Meanwhile, do we have any last minute stories we want to get to
8283000	8285000	while we wait for some calls?
8285000	8287000	Sure, we'll talk about a game called Inversion
8287000	8289000	which actually looks pretty sweet
8289000	8291000	and of course, the developer
8291000	8293000	of Timeshift, Saber Interactive
8293000	8295000	they're doing a new shooter
8295000	8297000	that kind of takes place during
8297000	8299000	an invasion by aliens called
8299000	8301000	Ludador, and what happens
8301000	8303000	they have these anti-gravity
8303000	8305000	bubbles, they're calling them
8305000	8307000	gravitational vectors
8307000	8309000	that appear in the game, changing the gravity
8309000	8311000	in different directions and also
8311000	8313000	becomes part of the game where you can flip stuff
8313000	8315000	upside down and whatnot
8315000	8317000	It's kind of cool, and they have a new weapon
8317000	8319000	in the game called a grappler that allows you to
8319000	8321000	manipulate gravity as well and move objects
8321000	8323000	around stuff, so that's kind of cool
8323000	8325000	and it looks like that'll be due out on the
8325000	8327000	Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 in
8327000	8329000	2010
8329000	8331000	Let's go to the phones and take a call
8331000	8333000	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?
8335000	8337000	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?
8339000	8341000	Hola, bienvenidos a Orange
8341000	8343000	Launch Radio, quien es?
8343000	8345000	Remember
8345000	8347000	you should always check your microphone
8347000	8349000	connection calling
8349000	8351000	Echo 123 on Skype
8351000	8353000	before you give us a call, otherwise
8353000	8355000	it may not work, but I could swear I heard somebody
8355000	8357000	breathing there, maybe they just couldn't hear us for some reason
8357000	8359000	I did, I heard someone breathing
8359000	8361000	I could too, so I don't know what the hell was going on there
8361000	8363000	So somebody was not paying attention
8363000	8365000	Don't know
8365000	8367000	what happened there
8367000	8369000	Do we have any other, well actually
8369000	8371000	here we go, we got another call coming in
8371000	8373000	Orange Launch Radio, who's this?
8373000	8375000	Hey, it's SSJ100 Matt
8375000	8377000	Hey SSJ100 Matt, how are you?
8379000	8381000	I'm doing good, quite a while
8381000	8383000	You're cutting out a little bit
8383000	8385000	I don't know what's going on, but what are you
8385000	8387000	up to tonight?
8387000	8389000	I've actually just got out of
8389000	8391000	Video Games Live
8391000	8393000	Video Games Live,
8393000	8395000	was it in New York City tonight?
8395000	8397000	It was
8397000	8399000	How was the show?
8399000	8401000	It was great, you know
8401000	8403000	I went to other shows
8403000	8405000	before, you know, I went to the Dear Friends concert
8405000	8407000	a while back when it was done around
8407000	8409000	and this was
8409000	8411000	you know, a lot more
8411000	8413000	this is a lot better
8413000	8415000	Well, was this your first Video Games Live
8415000	8417000	that you've been to?
8417000	8419000	This is the first one I've been to
8419000	8421000	What was kind of the highlight of the show
8421000	8423000	for you, you think?
8423000	8425000	Well
8425000	8427000	I think the best
8427000	8429000	was when he did the encore
8429000	8431000	it was Chrono Trigger
8431000	8433000	Because it was kind of
8433000	8435000	you know, he thought he wasn't going to be playing it
8435000	8437000	and then he came out
8437000	8439000	said this was the number one requested song
8439000	8441000	the piece that everyone
8441000	8443000	wanted to Video Games Live
8443000	8445000	And I just want to point out
8445000	8447000	we realize SSJ100 Matt
8447000	8449000	is breaking up, his connection
8449000	8451000	is kind of crap, I don't know if that's because of the new
8451000	8453000	Skype or what's going on, but we're going to try
8453000	8455000	and get through this because I want to talk about
8455000	8457000	Video Games Live a little bit. The Chrono Trigger piece
8457000	8459000	we were there
8459000	8461000	the night that debuted in Oakland
8461000	8463000	that was an awesome night, so a good piece
8463000	8465000	I'm glad that came out
8465000	8467000	Any lowlights?
8467000	8469000	Were there songs that they were playing
8469000	8471000	where you were kind of like, they could have bumped
8471000	8473000	this for something else?
8473000	8477000	Not really, I mean
8477000	8479000	I was
8479000	8481000	it was cool that they bought
8481000	8483000	Mega Man, which I don't think
8483000	8485000	they bought
8485000	8487000	in previous video shows
8487000	8489000	but
8489000	8491000	the note did change
8491000	8493000	they did play
8493000	8495000	Castlevania songs
8495000	8497000	Ah, Castlevania
8497000	8499000	Did they have any guests show up?
8499000	8501000	Because sometimes they have random guests show up at these things
8501000	8503000	Well they did have
8503000	8505000	a kid from YouTube
8505000	8507000	that played
8507000	8509000	Mario songs blindfolded
8509000	8511000	Oh, on the piano?
8511000	8513000	Yeah, I think Tommy
8513000	8515000	has him on the payroll or something
8515000	8517000	he follows him everywhere
8517000	8519000	And also, good show
8519000	8521000	they
8521000	8523000	called in
8523000	8525000	I'm trying to think of the name, Ross Bear
8525000	8527000	the creator of Pong
8527000	8529000	Oh, nice
8529000	8531000	So, that was interesting
8531000	8533000	Alright, well as I was showing them out
8533000	8535000	we're going to let you go because the connection is kind of
8535000	8537000	a bit crap, but thank you so much
8537000	8539000	for calling in
8539000	8541000	Yeah, I'm actually in
8541000	8543000	watching the rest of the Yankee
8543000	8545000	show, sorry about that
8545000	8547000	Alright, well take care
8547000	8549000	and thanks for giving us a call
8549000	8551000	and it's good to hear that the show is still going
8551000	8553000	and traveling across the nation. Take care, buddy
8555000	8557000	Alright
8557000	8559000	Let's see
8559000	8561000	Moving on to more
8561000	8563000	calls and more last minute stories
8563000	8565000	here on Orange Longest Radio
8565000	8567000	I hope that was just an isolated thing
8567000	8569000	and not something that's going to continue
8569000	8571000	We'll see, hopefully
8571000	8573000	He said he was somewhere, I don't know, he was cutting out
8573000	8575000	I think he said he was at a game or something, so we'll see
8575000	8577000	We'll try to get a couple more calls here
8577000	8579000	877-Game-O-L-R
8579000	8581000	Loki, do you have any other last minute stories?
8581000	8583000	Yeah, DiRT 2 is heading to PC's in December
8583000	8585000	It's going to be one of the first games using DirectX 11
8585000	8587000	and apparently they were shown off during the big
8587000	8589000	Windows 7 launch party in New York City
8591000	8593000	Hmm, it's very sexy looking
8593000	8595000	Alright, let's go to the phones
8595000	8597000	Hi, you're on Orange Longest Radio, who's this?
8597000	8599000	This is DS Master 25
8599000	8601000	Hi, DS Master 25, what's on your mind?
8603000	8605000	Well, kinda
8605000	8607000	sad story today
8607000	8609000	What's that?
8613000	8615000	As soon as I get done
8615000	8617000	What the hell is going on?
8617000	8619000	Is somebody breaking a dish behind you?
8619000	8621000	What is going on?
8621000	8623000	My mother
8623000	8625000	Basically my DS
8625000	8627000	Who are you talking to?
8627000	8629000	I'm on the radio, mom
8629000	8631000	Come on
8631000	8633000	It's 11 o'clock
8633000	8635000	Basically
8635000	8637000	the L button on my DS side died
8637000	8639000	and it's only been like a few months
8639000	8641000	and
8641000	8643000	I don't know if any of our listeners have had that problem
8645000	8647000	Is your mom mad that you're calling in
8647000	8649000	so late?
8649000	8651000	Probably
8651000	8653000	You shouldn't say Jesus in front of your mother like that
8653000	8655000	That's usually frowned upon, just so you know
8659000	8661000	You realize your whole call has just been shot
8661000	8663000	because now everybody's just saying
8663000	8665000	Mom, I'm on the radio
8667000	8669000	I'm sorry, but
8669000	8671000	basically my
8671000	8673000	DSi, the stupid L button
8673000	8675000	stopped working in the middle of 3D
8675000	8677000	pinball
8677000	8679000	I'm sorry to hear it
8679000	8681000	But mom's not gonna
8681000	8683000	buy you a new one if you keep staying up late
8683000	8685000	to call stupid internet radio programs
8685000	8687000	Well, anyways
8687000	8689000	I do have a good game review though
8689000	8691000	Kingdom Hearts
8691000	8693000	can be on a date over two days
8695000	8697000	I will say here
8697000	8699000	I've been a long time Square fan
8699000	8701000	even though I kinda
8701000	8703000	despise them on the first Kingdom Hearts
8703000	8705000	because I'm like, what the hell are you thinking
8705000	8707000	I'm playing with Disney?
8707000	8709000	You're stupid
8709000	8711000	Well, you know
8711000	8713000	if I'm telling you, don't knock it till you try it
8713000	8715000	So, uh, you know
8715000	8717000	and I still love the series right then and there
8717000	8719000	and
8719000	8721000	when Kyrie left
8721000	8723000	I kinda cried
8723000	8725000	and
8725000	8727000	basically now I'm still on the search for
8727000	8729000	in this one, which is supposed to be the
8729000	8731000	real link between
8731000	8733000	one and two
8733000	8735000	I was fortunate enough to sell my Playstation 2 op
8735000	8737000	because they're overdraft
8737000	8739000	but I'm planning on getting one again
8739000	8741000	just to play the rest of the Kingdom Hearts series
8741000	8743000	again
8743000	8745000	Your mom didn't see you crying in a video game
8745000	8747000	did she?
8747000	8749000	No, my girlfriend did
8749000	8751000	though, and she kinda cried along
8751000	8753000	because she's like, no Kyrie
8753000	8755000	don't leave
8755000	8757000	Well that's okay, you know, chicks seeing you cry
8757000	8759000	that just scores you points with them
8759000	8761000	but you don't want your mom to see you cry because then she thinks you're a wimp
8761000	8763000	Alright
8763000	8765000	Yeah, I'm posting my father is already
8765000	8767000	bashing the whole Hannah Montana
8767000	8769000	stuff and saying, at least you're playing good music
8769000	8771000	Wait, are you
8771000	8773000	a Hannah Montana fan?
8773000	8775000	I was the one who sent in
8775000	8777000	that angry message, you know
8777000	8779000	remember, leave Hannah alone
8779000	8781000	Do you guys remember that?
8781000	8783000	I try every day to forget
8783000	8785000	Episode 271
8785000	8787000	I'll go look it up
8787000	8789000	I don't remember
8789000	8791000	That would have only been like two years ago
8791000	8793000	That's alright
8793000	8795000	This isn't going to get any better
8795000	8797000	DS Master 25 or 26 or whoever you are
8797000	8799000	we've got to wrap up, it's way past your bedtime
8799000	8801000	young man, but any other last minute thoughts
8801000	8803000	before we let you go?
8803000	8805000	Beat Mania 2DX 17
8805000	8807000	so PS3 is going to rock
8807000	8809000	I'm importing it with a PS3
8809000	8811000	that's indefinite
8811000	8813000	I hope we actually see it over here
8813000	8815000	It's perfect
8815000	8817000	Later
8817000	8819000	Wow
8819000	8821000	That's like
8821000	8823000	and then
8823000	8825000	it got worse
8825000	8827000	and then it got worse
8827000	8829000	You have to admit that call is pretty epic
8829000	8831000	that was pretty awesome
8831000	8833000	It was cool, I kind of feel bad for a minute
8833000	8835000	that's alright
8835000	8837000	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?
8837000	8839000	Hello, this is Ray
8839000	8841000	or Ray Force
8841000	8843000	whatever you go on Orange Lounge Radio
8843000	8845000	What's up Ray?
8845000	8847000	What's your mind?
8847000	8849000	Well, this past week I managed to
8849000	8851000	get my hands on a Street Fighter 4
8851000	8853000	5 and 6 tournament edition
8853000	8855000	it had a big stick with the real arcade parts
8855000	8857000	Mhm
8857000	8859000	Now what did you think?
8859000	8861000	So I started
8861000	8863000	I was playing mostly shooter type games
8863000	8865000	like
8865000	8867000	writing fires and such
8867000	8869000	it takes some time getting used to it
8869000	8871000	especially with the square well
8871000	8873000	instead of having an octagonal well
8873000	8875000	I get used to it
8875000	8877000	playing a
8877000	8879000	tree shooter with a stick
8879000	8881000	it's really something you'd play with
8881000	8883000	a patterned keyboard
8883000	8885000	How expensive is this thing?
8887000	8889000	I got it at $95
8889000	8891000	at Fry's
8891000	8893000	but it was down to $95 instead of $100
8893000	8895000	like usual because it was a return
8895000	8897000	stick, I guess someone didn't like it
8897000	8899000	but said they returned it
8899000	8901000	I guess that kind of stuff
8901000	8903000	tends to go down in price though
8903000	8905000	after just a little bit of time
8905000	8907000	because haven't those been out a little while?
8907000	8909000	Since February
8909000	8911000	Yeah, they've been out for nearly a year now
8911000	8913000	and I believe the prices around VR
8913000	8915000	are starting to run out of them
8915000	8917000	Honestly
8917000	8919000	if you're to build your own, it's a lot cheaper
8919000	8921000	Really? Because I actually thought about getting one of those
8921000	8923000	I think we're thinking of the same
8923000	8925000	device, I was thinking about getting one of those
8925000	8927000	a while ago
8927000	8929000	Yeah, you can basically, if you get the encoder board
8929000	8931000	which, they're not that expensive
8931000	8933000	the actual
8933000	8935000	buttons and everything will cost anything
8935000	8937000	I'm not you, I can't build my own stuff
8937000	8939000	It plugs in! I mean my god
8939000	8941000	It's a switch
8941000	8943000	Fine, it's simple
8943000	8945000	You'd be surprised
8945000	8947000	Be very surprised
8947000	8949000	So Ray, was it worth the money?
8949000	8951000	No
8951000	8953000	Was it worth the money?
8953000	8955000	Definitely
8955000	8957000	I also love how it's real arcade parts
8957000	8959000	so if one of the buttons breaks down
8959000	8961000	I can just replace it with actual arcade parts
8963000	8965000	What I kind of like about what you're saying is that
8965000	8967000	you're not actually using this to play Street Fighter 4
8967000	8969000	but that you're using it to play other games
8969000	8971000	like shooters and stuff, because I think, seriously
8971000	8973000	if I were to get one of these, I'd actually use it to play Soul Calibur
8975000	8977000	Well, I suck horribly at fighters
8977000	8979000	I mean, I'm a snot person first
8979000	8981000	and a fighting game person
8981000	8987000	I'm like, way further down
8987000	8989000	I don't think it's worth it
8989000	8991000	Alright
8991000	8993000	Well, Buddy, do you have anything else you want to talk about tonight?
8993000	8995000	Any other games you've been playing lately?
8995000	8997000	I'm playing Space Invaders Extreme 2
8997000	8999000	but I haven't been playing it for long
8999000	9001000	so I'll probably tell him about it next week
9001000	9003000	Yeah, please do, I'm very curious to hear about that game
9003000	9005000	because I did enjoy the first one
9005000	9007000	I want to hear about what's new in the second one
9007000	9009000	You know
9009000	9011000	How about later when there's more time to talk
9011000	9015000	I used to most of my call this time on the arcade stage
9015000	9017000	so a lot of people can't be called
9017000	9019000	We'll arrange something
9019000	9021000	Okay
9021000	9023000	Alright, take care, Buddy
9023000	9025000	Hey, you're in the Bay Area, any chance we're going to see you at UmLoud?
9025000	9029000	I'm not sure
9029000	9033000	If on a Wednesday, I'm not sure if I'll be able to make it since on Thursdays
9033000	9035000	that's class Sunday at 9am
9035000	9037000	and that's in San Jose, not San Francisco
9037000	9039000	Oh yeah, that's right, you're in the South Bay
9039000	9041000	Well, we'll see
9041000	9043000	It is a weeknight, that's tough
9043000	9045000	but hopefully we'll see some of our Bay Area friends
9045000	9047000	able to get up there
9047000	9049000	so it's going to be a fun night
9049000	9051000	Alright, Buddy, thanks for calling
9051000	9053000	Alright, see you later
9053000	9055000	Speaking of San Jose, we've got to get our butts back to Fonomay next year
9055000	9057000	because we missed this year
9057000	9059000	I had a fun time at that convention
9059000	9061000	We've got to get back there
9061000	9063000	Anyhow, I guess that's going to do it for the Skype line tonight
9063000	9065000	Thank you for those folks that gave us a call
9065000	9067000	We hope you missed your chance tonight
9067000	9069000	You can always try again next week
9069000	9071000	But we are going to first check in
9071000	9073000	see if there's any other last minute stories
9073000	9075000	and wrap up the show
9075000	9077000	Just real quick, there's a new indie game that's on Xbox Live indie games
9077000	9079000	called Pumpkin Shop
9079000	9081000	and yes, this will be the perfect time of the year
9081000	9083000	to release a pumpkin carving sim
9083000	9085000	so you can do just that without the mess
9085000	9087000	and have your own virtual pumpkin
9087000	9089000	that no one can smash against your porch
9089000	9091000	No word on how expensive that is
9091000	9093000	but that is called Pumpkin Shop
9093000	9095000	Sounds a little ridiculous to me
9095000	9097000	It looks neat
9097000	9099000	It'd be cool if you could share it with your friends
9099000	9101000	If you want to carve a pumpkin, carve a pumpkin
9101000	9103000	I'm surprised there's not a Facebook app to do that
9103000	9105000	and then you share it with your friends
9105000	9107000	so they get annoying little notices and stuff
9107000	9109000	Yeah, I'm kind of surprised there isn't that too
9109000	9111000	but now that you said it, there'll probably be one
9111000	9113000	Is that it?
9113000	9115000	It's a shame that there's not millions of dollars
9115000	9117000	coming into my mailbox each day
9117000	9119000	because that would be tragic
9119000	9121000	I know, you can start your own game company
9121000	9123000	with a pumpkin carving Facebook app
9123000	9125000	release President Cat
9125000	9127000	You'd be a rich man
9127000	9129000	We'll see what we can do with President Cat
9129000	9131000	I mean, it's just a matter of giving
9131000	9133000	That sounds like a threat
9133000	9135000	That's not a threat
9135000	9137000	We'll just see where we can
9137000	9139000	We'll figure out who we want to target
9139000	9141000	to bug about releasing President Cat
9141000	9143000	over here and
9143000	9145000	I think access game localization
9145000	9147000	I know, I was going to say, whoever's doing Choaniki
9147000	9149000	I mean, really, really
9149000	9151000	They
9151000	9153000	What did they release?
9153000	9155000	They don't release that many games a year
9155000	9157000	so I think that they may have
9157000	9159000	their budget might be really low
9159000	9161000	I'd say both them and UFO Interactive
9161000	9163000	would be good candidates
9163000	9165000	to bug about
9165000	9167000	releasing the game over here
9167000	9169000	and then followed by maybe
9169000	9171000	I'm not sure about Ignition
9171000	9173000	or
9173000	9175000	oh, who was the other one?
9175000	9177000	Yeah, Ignition
9177000	9179000	because they
9179000	9181000	really only release certain types of games over here
9181000	9183000	you know, really a lot of the RPGs
9183000	9185000	and that kind of stuff
9185000	9187000	so that wouldn't really fit with them
9187000	9189000	but access game localization, man
9189000	9191000	it's all sorts of weird shit
9191000	9193000	Graffiti Interactive would be good too
9193000	9195000	but they're really low budget
9195000	9197000	and it takes forever for them to get stuff out
9197000	9199000	Well, if you guys send out emails out there
9199000	9201000	we definitely want to see
9201000	9203000	Send your responses, the responses you get back from companies
9203000	9205000	We'll post something, I'll post something
9205000	9207000	in our forums for it
9207000	9209000	We'll post the information of where we need to
9209000	9211000	go with that
9211000	9213000	You know, I love the
9213000	9215000	Excuse me, I love the way people used the photo stream
9215000	9217000	last week to show pictures of President and Cat
9217000	9219000	and their fan art
9219000	9221000	So I would like to encourage people this week
9221000	9223000	You know, we're still a little bit on our President and Cat kick
9223000	9225000	We'll think of a new theme maybe next week
9225000	9227000	But continuing on that, I would really like to see in the photo stream
9227000	9229000	and email your pics to
9229000	9231000	pics at orangelondredare.com
9231000	9233000	They go right up on our website when you do that
9233000	9235000	So I would like to see
9235000	9237000	conceptual box art
9237000	9239000	for this game if released in the US
9239000	9241000	That's what I'm going to challenge folks to do
9241000	9243000	on the picture feed this week
9243000	9245000	And I do think I will
9245000	9247000	post some information about
9247000	9249000	possible companies that would
9249000	9251000	maybe distribute this or
9251000	9253000	localize it or something
9253000	9255000	because obviously it's their money
9255000	9257000	that they're risking and stuff
9257000	9259000	But I think maybe even as sad as petitions go
9259000	9261000	because they're crap online
9261000	9263000	Maybe an online petition might not
9263000	9265000	hurt because at least it shows
9265000	9267000	there's a few
9267000	9269000	hundred people interested in getting this game
9269000	9271000	over here to see what we can do
9271000	9273000	It gives people focus to
9273000	9275000	make their mark or something like that
9275000	9277000	and we'll go from there
9277000	9279000	Well if that's it for Last Minute Stories
9279000	9281000	tonight, then we're going to go around and get everybody's
9281000	9283000	final thoughts. DarkSakura
9283000	9285000	your final thoughts tonight
9285000	9287000	Loki, your final thought tonight
9287000	9289000	My final thought is
9289000	9291000	I have my arcade cabinet in my house and now I've got to
9291000	9293000	finish it
9293000	9295000	My final thought is I want chicken
9295000	9297000	I'll play a loco to be exact
9297000	9299000	which reminds me of this week's episode
9299000	9301000	of South Park which is kind of funny
9301000	9303000	Anyhow, that's going to do it for this week's episode
9303000	9305000	of Orange Lawns Radio
9305000	9307000	Just a word to the wise out there
9307000	9309000	to those folks that are listening live
9309000	9311000	We have Daylight Savings Time kicking in next week
9311000	9313000	So it's Spring Forward, Fall, Back
9313000	9315000	So we will be moving the clocks
9315000	9317000	back an hour here
9317000	9319000	to celebrate Daylight Savings Time
9319000	9321000	in your country or where you are
9321000	9323000	We're looking at you, Arizona
9323000	9325000	It's Arizona that doesn't have it
9325000	9327000	So please plan accordingly for those of you folks
9327000	9329000	that don't have Daylight Savings Time
9329000	9331000	I guess that was it
9331000	9333000	Yeah, I get my final thought
9333000	9335000	We're good to go
9335000	9337000	I always like to say also if you enjoyed Orange Lawns Radio
9337000	9339000	please tell two friends about the show
9339000	9341000	Help spread the word
9341000	9343000	because remember we have no big magazine backing us up
9343000	9345000	We have no advertising dollars
9345000	9347000	We rely strictly on word of mouth
9347000	9349000	We do the show for free, no ads
9349000	9351000	It's not even nine o'clock yet
9351000	9353000	I know, it's kind of early tonight
9353000	9355000	Not really, it's still been an almost three hour show
9355000	9357000	Maybe two and a half
9357000	9359000	But it's time to wrap it up
9359000	9361000	Get on out of here
9361000	9363000	Have a good night everybody, we'll see you next week
9363000	9365000	We'll be back with more of Orange Lounge Radio
9365000	9367000	on November 1st
9367000	9369000	Can't believe it's almost the end of the year already
9369000	9371000	Getting into the very very busy game season
9371000	9375000	Orange Lounge Radio
9401000	9403000	Right anyway
9403000	9431000	See you next week
