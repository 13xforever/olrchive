WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:03.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:07.000 --> 00:13.000
We the hosts, Dark Sakura, Sky and Loco.

00:13.000 --> 00:16.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:27.000 --> 00:30.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:31.000 --> 00:34.000
Is that Sim Topless? What is the deal over there?

00:34.000 --> 00:36.000
Do you have naked sims on your computer?

00:36.000 --> 00:38.000
No, he's not naked, he's just wearing shorts.

00:38.000 --> 00:40.000
Oh hi, we're live. Hi, we're live.

00:40.000 --> 00:43.000
Actually, we're not live, we're taped tonight.

00:43.000 --> 00:45.000
It's a little special edition of Orange Lounge Radio.

00:45.000 --> 00:47.000
This is the voice from the past!

00:47.000 --> 00:50.000
That's right, scary ghost of Christmas past.

00:50.000 --> 00:52.000
No, we're pre-taping tonight.

00:52.000 --> 00:56.000
Obviously, if you've been following OLR, we're out this week.

00:56.000 --> 00:59.000
As you guys are hearing this live on All Games Radio,

00:59.000 --> 01:05.000
I am far, far away in a strange, mystical land that they call LA.

01:05.000 --> 01:07.000
Or LA.

01:07.000 --> 01:08.000
Dork.

01:08.000 --> 01:11.000
So yes, we're having a little bit of a pre-taped show tonight.

01:11.000 --> 01:14.000
So let me introduce ourselves if you've never heard Orange Lounge Radio before.

01:14.000 --> 01:16.000
I'm very sorry this had to be your first episode,

01:16.000 --> 01:19.000
but regardless, my name is Rob Roberts,

01:19.000 --> 01:21.000
and joining me is always say hello to the one and only,

01:21.000 --> 01:23.000
Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.

01:23.000 --> 01:27.000
Not here tonight, who plays with naked sims, just so you know.

01:27.000 --> 01:29.000
I'm not playing with naked sims.

01:29.000 --> 01:32.000
Not here tonight is the one and only tech master, Loki.

01:32.000 --> 01:35.000
We're taping not live on a Tuesday night,

01:35.000 --> 01:38.000
and Loki just isn't here.

01:38.000 --> 01:40.000
He didn't show up.

01:40.000 --> 01:43.000
And to be fair, I didn't call him tonight.

01:43.000 --> 01:46.000
I was going to say, shouldn't you have called?

01:46.000 --> 01:48.000
Well, probably I should have,

01:48.000 --> 01:51.000
but here's the thing is that then we'd have to wait 30 minutes for him to show up,

01:51.000 --> 01:54.000
and I'm just like, I want to get the hell out of here and get some dinner tonight.

01:54.000 --> 01:56.000
He missed the boat.

01:56.000 --> 01:57.000
I want dinner.

01:57.000 --> 01:59.000
Should we call Matt and see where he's at?

01:59.000 --> 02:00.000
Nah.

02:00.000 --> 02:02.000
No? Let him have his peace?

02:02.000 --> 02:04.000
He could be being intimate with the wife right now.

02:04.000 --> 02:05.000
That's true. I don't know.

02:05.000 --> 02:09.000
So Loki, I guess, just forgot that we were going to pre-tape a show Tuesday night.

02:09.000 --> 02:11.000
Technically, we're just taping.

02:11.000 --> 02:12.000
He's missed.

02:12.000 --> 02:14.000
Our aim is always improving, though.

02:14.000 --> 02:16.000
How do you pre-tape?

02:16.000 --> 02:17.000
Silly little...

02:17.000 --> 02:19.000
That's what they call it. That's industry speak for...

02:19.000 --> 02:21.000
Silly little prefixes.

02:21.000 --> 02:25.000
Now, I think we were going to do a best of tonight or something.

02:25.000 --> 02:27.000
I think we're going to roll that over until later,

02:27.000 --> 02:31.000
because one of our listeners slash staff members,

02:31.000 --> 02:34.000
in other words, he listened so long we decided to just make him a staff member,

02:34.000 --> 02:40.000
Dar Tetsuya, is like putting something together out of some really old episodes.

02:40.000 --> 02:42.000
And, of course, this wouldn't be...

02:42.000 --> 02:46.000
It just wouldn't be OLR if the music I didn't intend to play started playing.

02:46.000 --> 02:50.000
There we go.

02:50.000 --> 02:54.000
How does that happen, even when we're not live?

02:54.000 --> 02:56.000
I had two songs queued up tonight.

02:56.000 --> 03:01.000
The open and the Twitter topic song, which we'll get into a little later.

03:01.000 --> 03:03.000
I fail.

03:03.000 --> 03:05.000
Isn't it nice to know that even when we're not live,

03:05.000 --> 03:07.000
we can still have technical difficulties?

03:07.000 --> 03:08.000
Amazing.

03:08.000 --> 03:09.000
It wouldn't be us if we didn't.

03:09.000 --> 03:10.000
That's right.

03:10.000 --> 03:14.000
Well, usually we would start off the show with a little bit of how was your gaming week,

03:14.000 --> 03:18.000
although we're only about two days since we taped the last episode of Orange is on its Radio.

03:18.000 --> 03:21.000
I don't know if there's a lot new going on, but I'll ask, Dark Soccer,

03:21.000 --> 03:23.000
is there anything exciting going on in your gaming week?

03:23.000 --> 03:25.000
Sims 3 and Peggle.

03:25.000 --> 03:27.000
That's about it.

03:27.000 --> 03:29.000
It's pretty much the same story with me.

03:29.000 --> 03:32.000
Sims 3 and Peggle. Wow. What a coincidence.

03:32.000 --> 03:33.000
No, I'm not playing Sims 3 and Peggle.

03:33.000 --> 03:35.000
I'm playing WoW and Bejeweled.

03:35.000 --> 03:36.000
There you go.

03:36.000 --> 03:37.000
And Bejeweled in WoW, actually.

03:37.000 --> 03:39.000
I'm actually gonna...

03:39.000 --> 03:41.000
Hopefully if I can scrounge together the 14 bucks,

03:41.000 --> 03:45.000
I'll pay for a couple months of my account.

03:45.000 --> 03:48.000
You should definitely come back. It's crackalicious.

03:48.000 --> 03:50.000
I never really got into it, you know.

03:50.000 --> 03:52.000
Yeah?

03:52.000 --> 03:54.000
Why do you think you never were able to get into WoW?

03:54.000 --> 03:57.000
I mean, certainly, there's plenty of our listeners who don't play Warcraft.

03:57.000 --> 03:59.000
And there's some that do.

03:59.000 --> 04:01.000
What is it that made you not really want to stick with it?

04:01.000 --> 04:03.000
I'd hit around level 7 and go,

04:03.000 --> 04:07.000
What the hell am I doing with my time?

04:07.000 --> 04:09.000
I guess that's what I hear from a lot of people.

04:09.000 --> 04:11.000
Because, you know, like, when I was...

04:11.000 --> 04:14.000
I had a fun time playing with Tiara a while back.

04:14.000 --> 04:18.000
But it's like, I'm not a get up and Questarama type person

04:18.000 --> 04:20.000
and zip through them.

04:20.000 --> 04:24.000
I like to explore a little bit and take it, you know, kind of slow.

04:24.000 --> 04:27.000
And it's like, this is kind of boring.

04:27.000 --> 04:28.000
This is kind of boring.

04:28.000 --> 04:30.000
It almost sounds like you're talking about something dirty.

04:30.000 --> 04:31.000
It's kind of boring.

04:31.000 --> 04:36.000
I like to take my time and explore a little bit slow.

04:36.000 --> 04:39.000
Eh, it's kind of boring.

04:39.000 --> 04:44.000
I mean, I have a good time if I'm playing with people.

04:44.000 --> 04:47.000
Oh, shut up.

04:47.000 --> 04:49.000
Are you talking about WoW or what?

04:49.000 --> 04:54.000
With regards to World of Warcraft, I have a better time playing with a friend

04:54.000 --> 05:02.000
when I've got something to shut up.

05:02.000 --> 05:03.000
Alright.

05:03.000 --> 05:08.000
But what I was saying is more fun when I have other people to participate in the game with.

05:08.000 --> 05:11.000
I see. Fair enough.

05:11.000 --> 05:15.000
Of all the things in this room, you threw a box of Kleenex at me.

05:15.000 --> 05:16.000
Yep.

05:16.000 --> 05:18.000
You almost hit Shermie.

05:18.000 --> 05:20.000
But if it landed on Shermie, it wouldn't hurt her.

05:20.000 --> 05:21.000
Alright.

05:21.000 --> 05:23.000
You notice who did not budge?

05:23.000 --> 05:24.000
Shermie, yeah.

05:24.000 --> 05:29.000
She just parks her badass there next to the very warm computer for pretty much the night.

05:29.000 --> 05:32.000
That's her little fortress of solitude.

05:32.000 --> 05:33.000
Alright.

05:33.000 --> 05:34.000
Well, on tonight's show...

05:34.000 --> 05:37.000
Oh, I actually did play one new game I want to talk about.

05:37.000 --> 05:38.000
So, we'll give them something new.

05:38.000 --> 05:41.000
I played Luminous for the iPhone.

05:41.000 --> 05:42.000
Did you say Bluminous?

05:42.000 --> 05:43.000
No, Luminous.

05:43.000 --> 05:44.000
I thought so, but...

05:44.000 --> 05:46.000
Or Lumines, as some people call it.

05:46.000 --> 05:48.000
Luminous. Luminous.

05:48.000 --> 05:54.000
This is the puzzle game that, of course, was hugely, disgustingly popular on the PSP, and rightfully so.

05:54.000 --> 06:00.000
And then it had a sequel come out on the PSP that I don't think was quite as well received, even though it had Hollaback Girl.

06:00.000 --> 06:04.000
And then it had versions on the PlayStation Network, as well as Xbox Live.

06:04.000 --> 06:09.000
The Xbox Live version, of course, was highly criticized for being kind of the first microtransaction-y game.

06:09.000 --> 06:10.000
I hate that word.

06:10.000 --> 06:14.000
Lots and lots of little things to download and add to the game.

06:14.000 --> 06:16.000
Now it's out on iPhone.

06:16.000 --> 06:18.000
And I love Luminous.

06:18.000 --> 06:20.000
Like, Luminous is one of my favorite puzzle games ever.

06:20.000 --> 06:23.000
Because you know I love music games, and I love the whole infusion and all that.

06:23.000 --> 06:27.000
Kind of like how the music plays a part in the puzzle game.

06:27.000 --> 06:37.000
Where, you know, if you've never played Luminous before, basically you're trying to make blocks of varying size out of 4x4 blocks of different colors.

06:37.000 --> 06:41.000
But the bar that sweeps across the field moves in time to the music.

06:41.000 --> 06:45.000
And as you move the blocks around, the beats that it makes kind of fit in with the music.

06:45.000 --> 06:47.000
Is it worth the purchase to you?

06:47.000 --> 06:48.000
Well, here's the thing.

06:48.000 --> 06:51.000
On the iPhone, it sucks.

06:51.000 --> 06:52.000
It sucks.

06:52.000 --> 06:53.000
It sucks.

06:53.000 --> 06:54.000
I hate it.

06:54.000 --> 06:56.000
It is awful.

06:56.000 --> 07:04.000
The version of Luminous that I played on my old Sprint cell phone that had a four directional key and stuff was more fun to play.

07:04.000 --> 07:06.000
And let me tell you why.

07:06.000 --> 07:12.000
It's all about, and the reason why I'm so harsh on this game, because honestly, it's got some new skins.

07:12.000 --> 07:14.000
It is a very nice looking game.

07:14.000 --> 07:21.000
But the reason why I got so frustrated with this, I wanted to throw my phone across the room, is that the controls are shit.

07:21.000 --> 07:26.000
And the reason why is that they made one key design flaw.

07:26.000 --> 07:33.000
And that flaw is that in order to move the bricks, you touch the screen and you move your finger left, or you move your finger right.

07:33.000 --> 07:36.000
But to drop it, you move your finger down.

07:36.000 --> 07:39.000
So what do you think happens when I'm playing...

07:39.000 --> 07:40.000
Keep dropping it.

07:40.000 --> 07:41.000
Exactly.

07:41.000 --> 07:46.000
That's exactly what happens when I play Luminous on the phone, is that when I'm trying to move bricks left and right...

07:46.000 --> 07:52.000
Oh, and you tap the screen to rotate your block, which sometimes results in movement that you didn't intend.

07:52.000 --> 07:58.000
You need to have another control scheme in, or patch in another control scheme then, because that just sounds like it'd be...

07:58.000 --> 08:01.000
And like, Peggle is so beautiful on iPhone.

08:01.000 --> 08:04.000
Yeah, there's other games that work out great on iPhone, don't get me wrong.

08:04.000 --> 08:07.000
But Luminous is not one of them, and it's all about a design flaw.

08:07.000 --> 08:14.000
Like, it's to the point where I'm seriously looking at it going, did anyone actually play this game to see if it was any fun?

08:14.000 --> 08:21.000
Or was it something that was just kind of like conceived, and hey, iPhone gaming's really big, let's just kind of put it out there and see what happens.

08:21.000 --> 08:29.000
So, if you are a fan of Luminous, avoid, avoid, avoid, until they get this control scheme fixed.

08:29.000 --> 08:37.000
You know, I don't care if they put this shitty touch control thing in as an option, but what they need to do is have it so you can turn drops off,

08:37.000 --> 08:44.000
or that there's a specific little button in the right-hand corner or something where my thumb could rest that would drop the thing.

08:44.000 --> 08:49.000
And that's the only way you would drop it. That would make it so much better.

08:49.000 --> 08:50.000
I agree.

08:50.000 --> 08:51.000
So...

08:51.000 --> 08:53.000
From how you're describing it at any rate.

08:53.000 --> 08:54.000
Yeah.

08:54.000 --> 09:02.000
Alright, so we want to cover some news stories tonight for you guys, because even though it's only Tuesday, there's been a lot that's happened this week in gaming.

09:02.000 --> 09:06.000
You know, with the close of the Tokyo Game Show and so forth, there's quite a bit of stuff going on.

09:06.000 --> 09:13.000
Dark Soccer has been browsing the MMO world, and has found quite a bit going on apparently in the land of MMOs.

09:13.000 --> 09:27.000
Yeah, for the people looking forward to Star Trek Online, namely me, if you get the Season 3 Blu-Ray that's going to be coming out,

09:27.000 --> 09:37.000
then you will be actually receiving an Admiral's Outfit for Star Trek Online.

09:37.000 --> 09:43.000
So, I can't think of a lot of, like, buy-the-movie-get-something-in-a-game tie-ins going on.

09:43.000 --> 09:48.000
I'm sure there's been something else before that I'm just not thinking of, like, maybe with some of those Disney games they do and stuff,

09:48.000 --> 09:54.000
but that's, especially with an MMO, I can't think of a time where it's been buy a Blu-Ray, get an item in an MMO.

09:54.000 --> 09:55.000
Which is kind of interesting.

09:55.000 --> 10:00.000
I really think that they're trying to push the game, I mean, especially with using Champions to do it and all that,

10:00.000 --> 10:10.000
but yeah, it looks like they're really trying to get the fans of the series into the MMO even if they're not necessarily gamers.

10:10.000 --> 10:17.000
Which is smart, but the problem is, like, as weird as it sounds, I am kind of a bit of a Trekkie,

10:17.000 --> 10:22.000
but I don't really have an interest in those Blu-Rays, the original series Blu-Rays, right?

10:22.000 --> 10:27.000
Because, like, original series Season 3? Although, wait, no, there was no third series.

10:27.000 --> 10:28.000
Yeah, there was.

10:28.000 --> 10:29.000
Was there a third season?

10:29.000 --> 10:31.000
I thought there were only two, but whatever.

10:31.000 --> 10:36.000
I'm sure there, yeah, because third season is when you really started noticing the toupee.

10:36.000 --> 10:42.000
I'm not really into the original series anyway, as much of a Trekkie as I am, it was all about,

10:42.000 --> 10:49.000
yeah, I mean, I get that, but it was all about the, it was all about Next Generation and Voyager and DSpace 9.

10:49.000 --> 10:51.000
It's all about DS9.

10:51.000 --> 11:03.000
Yeah, so, I guess that's kind of cool, though, I mean, a little bonus perk tie-in, but sorry, I'm not going to spend, like, $80 on a Blu-Ray box set season just to get some, one dumb little item.

11:03.000 --> 11:05.000
Hopefully it'll be unlockable some other ways.

11:05.000 --> 11:11.000
Maybe. I mean, then again, it's like, the admirals, all they do is sit in a chair and be important.

11:11.000 --> 11:14.000
The captain's seat is what everyone joins Starfleet for.

11:14.000 --> 11:19.000
You know, to sort of paraphrase a DS9 episode.

11:19.000 --> 11:22.000
I'm still very, very curious about Star Trek Online.

11:22.000 --> 11:28.000
I'm a little jealous of those that went to PAX and got to get a little sneak peek of it, because I definitely am curious where this game is headed.

11:28.000 --> 11:31.000
There's a lot of great MMOs on the horizon.

11:31.000 --> 11:36.000
You know, Final Fantasy XIV, I'm sorry, hate on XI all you want, but XIV looks amazing.

11:36.000 --> 11:38.000
I'm really interested in where this game goes.

11:38.000 --> 11:44.000
Granted, you know, by the time I play it, a lot could change, but the trailer looked pretty cool.

11:44.000 --> 11:47.000
Even WoW's next expansion looks really good.

11:47.000 --> 11:51.000
Well, there's also some news about Final Fantasy XI since you brought it up.

11:51.000 --> 11:52.000
People are still playing Final Fantasy XI?

11:52.000 --> 11:53.000
Yeah.

11:53.000 --> 11:54.000
Wow.

11:54.000 --> 12:06.000
There's, in October, there's going to be a new expansion titled a Shantotto Ascension that's supposed to...

12:06.000 --> 12:12.000
Well, actually they say that the next free version update is going to be in November.

12:12.000 --> 12:17.000
But other than that, we're looking for October for the expansion pack.

12:17.000 --> 12:26.000
It will have the new Wings of the Goddess Nation quest, the Moblin Maze Monger's dungeon crawling system.

12:26.000 --> 12:38.000
And it's also the final part in a series of stories that was written by the guy who wrote the story for Chrono Trigger, Masato Kato.

12:38.000 --> 12:45.000
So, that is going to stick out for a lot of people. If it was written by the guy who did Chrono Trigger, there's going to be fanboys that are like, huh? What?

12:45.000 --> 12:51.000
Well, the trilogy of the stories, I'm trying to pull up that information.

12:51.000 --> 13:13.000
But seriously, I don't think that it's really supposed to be all of that, because there was the Crystalline Prophecy was the first one, and then there was the Mughal Kupo Detat, the Evil in Small Doses.

13:13.000 --> 13:17.000
Oh, I remember hearing about these. These were the very small mini expansions they released.

13:17.000 --> 13:18.000
Yeah.

13:18.000 --> 13:24.000
Like online only that you would get for the game. I guess they pretty much stopped with the in-store ones, which makes sense.

13:24.000 --> 13:30.000
If they have 14 on the horizon, development for 11 is probably going to slow up significantly and remain things like this.

13:30.000 --> 13:31.000
Yeah, I agree.

13:31.000 --> 13:36.000
Which is very interesting. What happens to a game like Final Fantasy XI when Final Fantasy XIV comes out?

13:36.000 --> 13:40.000
It's probably going to go the way of PSO.

13:40.000 --> 13:47.000
But you look at EverQuest and EverQuest II, I think there's more people still playing the original EverQuest. It's going to be interesting.

13:47.000 --> 13:54.000
But I think that doesn't always happen, though. Then again, there are still a bunch of people playing Diablo II.

13:54.000 --> 13:57.000
Yeah, we haven't had a lot of MMOs get sequels yet, you know what I mean?

13:57.000 --> 13:58.000
Yeah.

13:58.000 --> 14:00.000
And Diablo III's still not out.

14:00.000 --> 14:06.000
Well, the Ragnarok one was still going on, and a lot of people were still preferring the 2D over the 3D.

14:06.000 --> 14:08.000
Oh, that's right. I totally forgot about Ragnarok II.

14:08.000 --> 14:09.000
Yeah.

14:09.000 --> 14:13.000
Hmm. I wonder if that... So that finally came out at some point?

14:13.000 --> 14:16.000
I don't know. I stopped paying attention to it, honestly.

14:16.000 --> 14:17.000
Nice.

14:17.000 --> 14:20.000
I haven't touched Ragnarok in like a month, so...

14:20.000 --> 14:23.000
A whole month?

14:23.000 --> 14:28.000
I couldn't really get back into it. I sort of was going through the same thing that I went through with World of Warcraft.

14:28.000 --> 14:31.000
What am I doing with my time?

14:31.000 --> 14:35.000
So you went back to Sims instead.

14:35.000 --> 14:38.000
This is actually the first time I've opened Sims in two weeks.

14:38.000 --> 14:39.000
I'm just giving you a hard time.

14:39.000 --> 14:42.000
Except to remodel a character.

14:42.000 --> 14:44.000
But there's something about a game that you like, Rob.

14:44.000 --> 14:45.000
What's that?

14:45.000 --> 14:46.000
Aion.

14:46.000 --> 14:51.000
Aion? You know what's funny? I never did end up buying the full game, because I heard about all the problems they were having.

14:51.000 --> 14:55.000
So, you know, I don't need to be the very first person in an MMO.

14:55.000 --> 14:58.000
I want to give Aion a few months to let the dust settle.

14:58.000 --> 15:00.000
Because it's been having a lot of issues.

15:00.000 --> 15:04.000
Well, this is actually more news for our European listeners, anyway.

15:04.000 --> 15:07.000
They're opening two European servers.

15:07.000 --> 15:13.000
One is a French language server called Deltres, and an English server called Carun.

15:13.000 --> 15:22.000
It's supposed to be available for character transfers from the different servers in a couple of months.

15:22.000 --> 15:24.000
They haven't said exactly.

15:24.000 --> 15:29.000
But it's on its way.

15:29.000 --> 15:34.000
They say that everything should...

15:34.000 --> 15:39.000
Well, they kind of needed it, because they were having a lot of problems when it launched in Europe.

15:39.000 --> 15:41.000
The servers were backing up like crazy, too.

15:41.000 --> 15:48.000
That's what it was saying, is that there was way too much of a backlog on the servers and slowing everything down.

15:48.000 --> 15:53.000
So that's why they've opened the other two, and they're going to have it where you can move your characters.

15:53.000 --> 15:57.000
But that's... that's... something.

15:57.000 --> 16:00.000
Hmm. Alright.

16:00.000 --> 16:04.000
Well, I've got some other news for you guys that doesn't have to do with MMOs.

16:04.000 --> 16:07.000
There's actually been a few things that have happened over the past couple days.

16:07.000 --> 16:13.000
The Wii got a system update. It has a brand new 4.2 release software, and you might be asking,

16:13.000 --> 16:15.000
Oh, what cool new feature do I get with this?

16:15.000 --> 16:17.000
And the answer is nothing.

16:17.000 --> 16:20.000
At least there's nothing that they're touting that is big about this release.

16:20.000 --> 16:25.000
Apparently, the Wii system update 4.2 really only did some things behind the scenes,

16:25.000 --> 16:30.000
and it's also supposed to improve performance of the system, whatever that means.

16:30.000 --> 16:35.000
I don't know what exactly was broken that they needed to fix, but they're saying that's what they did in this.

16:35.000 --> 16:40.000
Also, what you probably want to know, it patches out the homebrew channel at least for, you know,

16:40.000 --> 16:42.000
the next couple days until they figure it out.

16:42.000 --> 16:45.000
Exactly. So it shuts out the homebrew channel once again.

16:45.000 --> 16:50.000
So if you are a homebrew Wii person, you might want to avoid that update for a little bit.

16:50.000 --> 16:54.000
But everybody's little blue light was a-glowing this week.

16:54.000 --> 16:57.000
Also, big, big, and confirmed this week.

16:57.000 --> 16:59.000
There were some rumors about this, and we talked about it on the show,

16:59.000 --> 17:03.000
but Super Street Fighter 4 was confirmed earlier this week.

17:03.000 --> 17:08.000
It apparently was revealed by GameSpot, has released the first details on the game.

17:08.000 --> 17:12.000
T-Hawk and DJ are coming back in the game.

17:12.000 --> 17:16.000
And there's also going to be a brand new female character named Juri

17:16.000 --> 17:19.000
that is coming back to Street Fighter 4, Super Street Fighter 4.

17:19.000 --> 17:22.000
Oh, wait, is this spelled J-U-R-I?

17:22.000 --> 17:23.000
Yeah.

17:23.000 --> 17:31.000
It could also be one of the alpha characters. Remember, Judy and Junie?

17:31.000 --> 17:36.000
I'll be honest, I didn't play much of the alpha series, which is why I'm reading that like it's news to me.

17:36.000 --> 17:41.000
Sadly, no, I don't know. There's a little trailer here that might show more information.

17:41.000 --> 17:43.000
I'll play a little bit of the trailer here.

17:43.000 --> 17:49.000
But I did want to say it's not just these three characters.

17:49.000 --> 17:52.000
There's going to be five more, eight new characters in Super Street Fighter 4.

17:52.000 --> 17:53.000
When?

17:53.000 --> 17:58.000
Yeah, so let's see here. There's a little back and forth going on there.

17:58.000 --> 18:06.000
I love the graphic style in this. It's so gorgeous.

18:06.000 --> 18:08.000
Nah, it doesn't look like that.

18:08.000 --> 18:10.000
Yeah, it looks like just another Ken versus Ryu little epic battle.

18:10.000 --> 18:15.000
I don't know if it's really going to show any new people.

18:15.000 --> 18:16.000
Ken looks this odd.

18:16.000 --> 18:20.000
Boy, what if this is what the fighting actually looked like in the game?

18:20.000 --> 18:22.000
That'd be awesome.

18:22.000 --> 18:25.000
It's the same freaking font and everything.

18:25.000 --> 18:26.000
For Super?

18:26.000 --> 18:27.000
Yeah.

18:27.000 --> 18:28.000
That's kind of cool.

18:28.000 --> 18:29.000
Of course you know I noticed the font.

18:29.000 --> 18:30.000
I know. You nerd.

18:30.000 --> 18:36.000
So yeah, there's going to be eight new characters, three of them probably familiar.

18:36.000 --> 18:41.000
Now, what's also interesting, this game is coming out in the spring in an already crowded 2010.

18:41.000 --> 18:44.000
It's coming out on the PlayStation 3 and the Xbox 360.

18:44.000 --> 18:49.000
You will not be able to do cross-game matches between the original Street Fighter 4 and Super

18:49.000 --> 18:52.000
because they are also doing some character balancing.

18:52.000 --> 18:56.000
They're going to address some of the concerns that people had about the original characters in the game.

18:56.000 --> 18:59.000
And of course, you know, there's eight new characters.

18:59.000 --> 19:03.000
Apparently though, Capcom will not charge full price for the title.

19:03.000 --> 19:04.000
I'm not sure what that means.

19:04.000 --> 19:10.000
I'm assuming that means it's probably going to be in the realm of about $40 for this as opposed to a full $60 game.

19:10.000 --> 19:15.000
Another thing to consider, did they say that it was going to be hard copy or did they say it's going to be a download?

19:15.000 --> 19:18.000
I believe this is an all new release that's coming out.

19:18.000 --> 19:20.000
It's not some type of download expansion.

19:20.000 --> 19:22.000
I think we'll get some answers to that in the next few days.

19:22.000 --> 19:25.000
But it certainly, I think it would be too big for a download, I think.

19:25.000 --> 19:28.000
Eight new characters and all this character balancing.

19:28.000 --> 19:30.000
That's big.

19:30.000 --> 19:31.000
So I'm pretty sure it's going to be.

19:31.000 --> 19:34.000
Does this mean that they're going to make Seth less of an ass?

19:34.000 --> 19:36.000
Hopefully.

19:36.000 --> 19:40.000
I mean, even the guys that made the game said he's way too powerful.

19:40.000 --> 19:42.000
I remember that coming up on a previous episode of the show.

19:42.000 --> 19:44.000
It was fun.

19:44.000 --> 19:48.000
Alright, one other story I've got for you guys about Squeenix.

19:48.000 --> 19:54.000
And Squeenix, apparently earlier this week, of course that's my lovely name for Square Enix, which now is Square Enix Eidos.

19:54.000 --> 19:55.000
All that stuff in there.

19:55.000 --> 19:59.000
So what would they be? Squeenodos. Squeendos.

19:59.000 --> 20:03.000
That sounds like a flu that will be going around next year. We'll see.

20:03.000 --> 20:08.000
Anyhow, they are obviously a huge company with a lot of role playing games.

20:08.000 --> 20:13.000
Some of their biggest franchises, of course, Dragon Quest, Kingdom Hearts, Final Fantasy.

20:13.000 --> 20:23.000
Well, they have come out and said in a recent interview with Rooters that they want to have eight flagship IPs that will be capable of selling two million units.

20:23.000 --> 20:33.000
If each one of these games has a two year development cycle for a new game in the franchise, then that means every quarter they could release a two million selling game.

20:33.000 --> 20:38.000
And you could certainly see that happening with series like Final Fantasy, Dragon Quest, Kingdom Hearts.

20:38.000 --> 20:41.000
But the question is, where the hell are the other games going to come from?

20:41.000 --> 20:43.000
Star Ocean?

20:43.000 --> 20:45.000
Is that a two million selling title every time?

20:45.000 --> 20:49.000
The Tales games?

20:49.000 --> 20:57.000
Well, one thought is that perhaps because they also just recently got Eidos as a part of this as well, Eidos made Batman Arkham Asylum, let's not forget.

20:57.000 --> 21:05.000
So the Batman series, which as weird as it is to say that Square Enix would have Batman, that could be a possible kind of IP for them.

21:05.000 --> 21:07.000
Batman and Kingdom Hearts!

21:07.000 --> 21:10.000
Oh, God.

21:10.000 --> 21:13.000
I don't know if that's possible, but that would be interesting.

21:13.000 --> 21:16.000
Shut up, Sora. I'm Batman.

21:16.000 --> 21:19.000
What? I'm Batman. Are you one of the heartless?

21:19.000 --> 21:21.000
I'm Batman!

21:21.000 --> 21:23.000
Batman!

21:23.000 --> 21:28.000
You almost, you know what you remind me of there is Eddie Murphy from 80s Saturday Night Live.

21:28.000 --> 21:32.000
My name is Gumby. I'm Gumby Dammit.

21:32.000 --> 21:33.000
That's old school.

21:33.000 --> 21:35.000
That's very old school. That's older than most of our listeners.

21:35.000 --> 21:36.000
That's older than most schools.

21:36.000 --> 21:38.000
That joke right there. That's right.

21:38.000 --> 21:42.000
So, alright, well Jamie wants to tell you guys about one other thing.

21:42.000 --> 21:46.000
This is actually in regards to Left 4 Dead.

21:46.000 --> 21:54.000
The Crash Course is actually out on Steam in the Xbox Live Marketplace, and there's actually a price point on it.

21:54.000 --> 22:01.000
It actually was released at a higher price point, but ended up being an error.

22:01.000 --> 22:13.000
It is actually going to be out for, well, is out, I should say, for 560 Microsoft points right now, but it is, like I said, an error.

22:13.000 --> 22:21.000
So if you think it's worth the money to spend a little bit more on it, go for it, but just keep in mind it is going to be dropped.

22:21.000 --> 22:30.000
And, of course, if you have it on PC, then the Crash Course actually isn't really available from Steam yet.

22:30.000 --> 22:35.000
It's supposed to, you know, bridge the gap between the death toll and No Mercy.

22:35.000 --> 22:40.000
That is very strange that it wouldn't even be on Valve's own service yet. On Steam.

22:40.000 --> 22:42.000
I'm sure it's just a little hold up.

22:42.000 --> 22:44.000
It just says that the download content is not available yet.

22:44.000 --> 22:46.000
Soon. Soon.

22:46.000 --> 22:47.000
Maybe.

22:47.000 --> 22:53.000
Alright, well we're going to get into a little segment we do here on Orange Launch Radio called Twitter Topics because...

22:53.000 --> 22:54.000
Because we can.

22:54.000 --> 22:56.000
Because we can. Basically that's what it boils down to.

22:56.000 --> 23:01.000
We're bored and don't really know what else to talk about here on the show tonight because it's only been a couple days since our last show.

23:01.000 --> 23:04.000
We go to Twitter and we say, hey guys, what do you guys want us to talk about tonight?

23:04.000 --> 23:09.000
Because, you know, it's where every gamer has a voice and, sadly, we can't do calls tonight because we're not actually live.

23:09.000 --> 23:14.000
There's another show going on on All Games right now, so we couldn't, you know, we don't have our own radio station anymore.

23:14.000 --> 23:16.000
We can't just bust down the door and say, hey guys, we're live.

23:16.000 --> 23:20.000
We could just go, hey, chat room, someone call us.

23:20.000 --> 23:26.000
I guess we could go bust down the door on All Games, but I don't think the VGO fans would appreciate that.

23:26.000 --> 23:29.000
Well, no, no, no. They can call our line.

23:29.000 --> 23:31.000
We only have a couple of people on chat right now.

23:31.000 --> 23:35.000
Well, I've been soliciting questions from chat, so we got plenty and plenty of questions from you.

23:35.000 --> 23:37.000
By all means, Mr. Rob Korski.

23:37.000 --> 23:40.000
Tweets and chatters and all this stuff.

23:40.000 --> 23:42.000
Blue Swim is our first tweeter tonight.

23:42.000 --> 23:44.000
We got a lot of tweet questions.

23:44.000 --> 23:47.000
We got more, we got like twice as many as we usually do on a Sunday.

23:47.000 --> 23:48.000
Really?

23:48.000 --> 23:50.000
Maybe we need to move our show to Tuesday nights.

23:50.000 --> 23:51.000
No.

23:51.000 --> 23:52.000
Yeah, I know, I agree.

23:52.000 --> 23:58.000
Blue Swim on the Twitter asks, what do you guys think of the natural disaster survival genre?

23:58.000 --> 24:05.000
Twister the game with a flying cow and digital Helen Hunt tits equals epic win.

24:05.000 --> 24:07.000
You know what, though?

24:07.000 --> 24:11.000
If Loki were here, he would diss that game that Konami was showing at E3, which was something like that.

24:11.000 --> 24:13.000
It was like a natural disaster game.

24:13.000 --> 24:15.000
And there was one of those on Xbox Live not that long ago, too.

24:15.000 --> 24:19.000
And neither one of those games was exactly as awesome as you would think.

24:19.000 --> 24:22.000
And neither one had digital Helen Hunt tits, either.

24:22.000 --> 24:32.000
The closest I've ever played that had natural disasters in it that I could stand was the tornado area in Sonic the Hedgehog on Dreamcast.

24:32.000 --> 24:34.000
Because that was pretty freaking cool.

24:34.000 --> 24:37.000
Other than that, suck!

24:37.000 --> 24:41.000
Blue Swim goes on to say in a second tweet, after playing the PlayStation 2 game Raw Danger,

24:41.000 --> 24:46.000
I'm convinced that the disaster genre has huge amounts of untapped potential.

24:46.000 --> 24:47.000
I have to be honest.

24:47.000 --> 24:48.000
Let's leave that untapped, please.

24:48.000 --> 24:50.000
That's not a game I've ever played.

24:50.000 --> 24:52.000
Is that something newer?

24:52.000 --> 24:54.000
This is PlayStation 2.

24:54.000 --> 24:56.000
I have no idea.

24:56.000 --> 25:01.000
Gamer Girl on the Twitter asks, what was the first game anyone's ever played?

25:01.000 --> 25:03.000
Ooh, that's tough.

25:03.000 --> 25:06.000
I gotta go way back.

25:06.000 --> 25:08.000
There's two.

25:08.000 --> 25:12.000
The earliest memories, because, you know, I don't remember, unfortunately, far enough back.

25:12.000 --> 25:15.000
You know, it's hard, because when you're that young, you don't remember everything.

25:15.000 --> 25:18.000
But I would say I kind of have a memory of two games.

25:18.000 --> 25:22.000
One of them would be Spider-Man on the Atari 2600.

25:22.000 --> 25:25.000
It was one of the first games I ever remember playing.

25:25.000 --> 25:28.000
And at the arcade, Crystal Castles.

25:28.000 --> 25:32.000
I remember going to my sister's wedding reception.

25:32.000 --> 25:37.000
And they had it, like, I don't want to say she had her wedding reception at Chuck E. Cheese,

25:37.000 --> 25:40.000
but there was some type of, like, I think it was like a rehearsal party.

25:40.000 --> 25:43.000
That's what it was. It was like a post-wedding rehearsal party.

25:43.000 --> 25:46.000
I was, like, three, so I barely remember this.

25:46.000 --> 25:50.000
But there was some type of, like, wedding rehearsal post-party, and it was at Chuck E. Cheese.

25:50.000 --> 25:53.000
And I remember playing Crystal Castles, and I thought that game was the shit.

25:53.000 --> 25:59.000
I remember being four and playing Pong on an arcade machine.

25:59.000 --> 26:03.000
I grew up playing pinball, really.

26:03.000 --> 26:10.000
As far as early memories, like, I remember being six

26:10.000 --> 26:15.000
and going to play the Odyssey 2 at my friend's house next door.

26:15.000 --> 26:19.000
And playing Casey Munchkin and Casey Crazychase.

26:19.000 --> 26:27.000
And we also, you know, I had a Cliccovision when I was a kid.

26:27.000 --> 26:31.000
I remember playing Atari a lot earlier, Atari 2600 a lot earlier,

26:31.000 --> 26:37.000
because I remember playing Pitfall.

26:37.000 --> 26:39.000
Who enabled your gaming addiction?

26:39.000 --> 26:43.000
Because it doesn't sound like your mom was really that much into video games,

26:43.000 --> 26:46.000
but yet you had all these systems that I never heard of.

26:46.000 --> 26:50.000
My mom actually was kind of into games, you know.

26:50.000 --> 26:56.000
Because keep in mind, when I was four, my mom was still in her early 20s.

26:56.000 --> 27:00.000
You know, most of my childhood was spent with my mom in her 20s.

27:00.000 --> 27:04.000
And so she liked to go out and have fun and liked games and played some pinball.

27:04.000 --> 27:08.000
And when we'd go get pizza, she'd give me a few quarters

27:08.000 --> 27:14.000
and leave me in the little game area so I could play the Mario one or play a kangaroo.

27:14.000 --> 27:18.000
Kangaroo was, I was the shit at kangaroo.

27:18.000 --> 27:23.000
I mean, over Godfather's Pizza back in the day in Mobile.

27:23.000 --> 27:24.000
Wow.

27:24.000 --> 27:28.000
And I've been a gamer practically since, you know,

27:28.000 --> 27:34.000
I knew that turn this knob, the bar moves this way, you know.

27:34.000 --> 27:37.000
Yeah, I have very early memories of Atari 2600 in much the same way.

27:37.000 --> 27:40.000
I don't remember who got one for the family or how we got it,

27:40.000 --> 27:44.000
but we had an Atari 2600 and my dad hooked it up so that, you know.

27:44.000 --> 27:46.000
But it was hooked up in my mom's room, which I always thought was weird,

27:46.000 --> 27:50.000
but I think that was so that if my dad wanted to watch TV

27:50.000 --> 27:52.000
or somebody wanted to watch like a real show,

27:52.000 --> 27:56.000
then I wouldn't be monopolizing the big television with video games.

27:56.000 --> 27:58.000
I would always have to kind of like go in my mom's room to play,

27:58.000 --> 28:00.000
and then she'd get mad if I don't ask first.

28:00.000 --> 28:08.000
I also played a lot of Apple II games, like a lot of Kix, Load Runner.

28:08.000 --> 28:13.000
I also grew up on the Carmen Sandiego games.

28:13.000 --> 28:15.000
Yes, I played those too.

28:15.000 --> 28:17.000
Oregon Trail.

28:17.000 --> 28:21.000
Our family got a Commodore 64, Christmas 1983.

28:21.000 --> 28:25.000
I remember that, that was a big, that would have been five at the time.

28:25.000 --> 28:27.000
And that was like our first computer.

28:27.000 --> 28:31.000
And honestly, between Atari 2600 and Nintendo Entertainment System,

28:31.000 --> 28:33.000
that was my gaming platform.

28:33.000 --> 28:36.000
When I was in second grade, we got our Cliccovision,

28:36.000 --> 28:39.000
and we had the driving wheel and everything, and we set that up.

28:39.000 --> 28:42.000
There's actually still pictures in one of my mom's photo albums

28:42.000 --> 28:47.000
of me sitting on the floor playing mousetrap.

28:47.000 --> 28:59.000
And her stupid ex-husband, Craphead, playing, he was really good at Carnival.

28:59.000 --> 29:01.000
Oh, the little, is that the one where the clowns bounce up and down

29:01.000 --> 29:03.000
and pop the balloons?

29:03.000 --> 29:07.000
Yeah, it's this little glass thing shooting game.

29:07.000 --> 29:09.000
Oh, no, I know.

29:09.000 --> 29:11.000
Okay, I know what game you're talking about.

29:11.000 --> 29:12.000
It's like an old ass shooting game.

29:12.000 --> 29:14.000
Adventure was my game.

29:14.000 --> 29:16.000
It was freaking hard too.

29:16.000 --> 29:19.000
And what else did we have?

29:19.000 --> 29:21.000
Gorf.

29:21.000 --> 29:22.000
We had a stack of games.

29:22.000 --> 29:27.000
I think that I have, we actually have my Cliccovision.

29:27.000 --> 29:32.000
We got another one since then, but we actually have just my core Cliccovision.

29:32.000 --> 29:37.000
And I might be permitted to part, I might be convinced to part with it.

29:37.000 --> 29:38.000
What a trip down memory lane.

29:38.000 --> 29:39.000
Thank you very much for the question, gamer girl.

29:39.000 --> 29:41.000
It's in the vault somewhere.

29:41.000 --> 29:43.000
I would love to hook up the old ass systems

29:43.000 --> 29:46.000
and see how long some of those games can hold our attention today.

29:46.000 --> 29:49.000
There's the point of actually having a TV that will run some of them.

29:49.000 --> 29:52.000
Keep in mind, my Odyssey 2, we don't have a TV it works on.

29:52.000 --> 29:58.000
Um, they take the RF, it's all RF, or the old coaxial cable thing, right?

29:58.000 --> 29:59.000
The little hooky things.

29:59.000 --> 30:01.000
That go with the coaxial cable, right?

30:01.000 --> 30:02.000
Like hooking up cable.

30:02.000 --> 30:05.000
Mmm, ye.

30:05.000 --> 30:06.000
Right? Isn't that what they use?

30:06.000 --> 30:07.000
No, no, no.

30:07.000 --> 30:08.000
Really?

30:08.000 --> 30:11.000
This had the little scoop things that you screwed into the back of your TV.

30:11.000 --> 30:12.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

30:12.000 --> 30:13.000
The antenna.

30:13.000 --> 30:14.000
Yeah, that's what I'm talking about.

30:14.000 --> 30:17.000
Oh, I thought you were talking about the cable type coax.

30:17.000 --> 30:19.000
No, no, it's uh...

30:19.000 --> 30:21.000
Yeah, that screws into the little converter box.

30:21.000 --> 30:22.000
Yep, yep, yep.

30:22.000 --> 30:23.000
The switch, the RF switch, yeah.

30:23.000 --> 30:24.000
So those, um...

30:24.000 --> 30:26.000
My Nintendo had one of those.

30:26.000 --> 30:29.000
You know, those TVs are going to actually be really easy to find now

30:29.000 --> 30:31.000
because a lot of them, because of the whole digital TV transition,

30:31.000 --> 30:32.000
They're obsolete.

30:32.000 --> 30:33.000
They're obsolete.

30:33.000 --> 30:34.000
So what else are they good for but playing...

30:34.000 --> 30:35.000
Thrift store!

30:35.000 --> 30:36.000
Yeah, seriously.

30:36.000 --> 30:38.000
Anyhow, let's move on with some other questions.

30:38.000 --> 30:39.000
That was a lot.

30:39.000 --> 30:41.000
Takeo Ray wanted to plug his Extra Life donation page.

30:41.000 --> 30:43.000
The URL is very long.

30:43.000 --> 30:45.000
I'll go ahead and read it here because obviously Extra Life

30:45.000 --> 30:47.000
was something we wanted to be involved with.

30:47.000 --> 30:49.000
Unfortunately, we had to back out as shared on the last show,

30:49.000 --> 30:52.000
which sucks, but we are still supporting the cause, certainly.

30:52.000 --> 30:57.000
Takeo Ray's page is at waystogive.texaschildrens.org

30:57.000 --> 31:02.000
slash netcommunity slash Allen, A-L-L-E-N, Ray, R-E-Y.

31:02.000 --> 31:03.000
That's all one word.

31:03.000 --> 31:05.000
A-L-L-E-N, R-E-Y.

31:05.000 --> 31:07.000
I do want to say, though, if you just want to check out

31:07.000 --> 31:08.000
what Extra Life's all about in general,

31:08.000 --> 31:11.000
I'm sure Takeo Ray would not mind if you just donate

31:11.000 --> 31:13.000
to somebody that's participating,

31:13.000 --> 31:16.000
extralife.sarcasticgamer.com.

31:16.000 --> 31:19.000
Sarcastic Gamer, of course, being another podcast.

31:19.000 --> 31:21.000
I've never listened to it,

31:21.000 --> 31:23.000
so I couldn't tell you what they're about.

31:23.000 --> 31:25.000
That's not a slam on that show.

31:25.000 --> 31:27.000
I don't listen to pretty much any other podcast,

31:27.000 --> 31:30.000
but Bobby, because he's on before us,

31:30.000 --> 31:32.000
that's just because I want to make sure

31:32.000 --> 31:35.000
we don't inadvertently copy somebody else.

31:35.000 --> 31:37.000
I would hate for that to happen.

31:37.000 --> 31:38.000
Exactly.

31:38.000 --> 31:41.000
But I'm sure they're sarcastic.

31:41.000 --> 31:42.000
It is in the title.

31:42.000 --> 31:45.000
No.

31:45.000 --> 31:47.000
I don't know how to pronounce this name,

31:47.000 --> 31:48.000
but I'll try.

31:48.000 --> 31:51.000
Sponchtwang, S-P-O-N-C-H-T-W-A-N-G.

31:51.000 --> 31:52.000
Sponchtwang?

31:52.000 --> 31:53.000
Close enough.

31:53.000 --> 31:55.000
What do you guys think about Konami rolling out

31:55.000 --> 31:57.000
the official DDR tourney?

31:57.000 --> 31:58.000
You know, Konami announced...

31:58.000 --> 31:59.000
What?

31:59.000 --> 32:02.000
They are doing an official DDR tournament

32:02.000 --> 32:04.000
that is going to be in certain cities across the US,

32:04.000 --> 32:09.000
and it all kind of comes to a head at an official Vegas tournament.

32:09.000 --> 32:11.000
But in order to go to the one in Vegas,

32:11.000 --> 32:13.000
you have to win one of the satellite competitions that's happening.

32:13.000 --> 32:14.000
Qualifiers.

32:14.000 --> 32:15.000
Yeah, basically.

32:15.000 --> 32:17.000
I don't think there is one happening in NorCal.

32:17.000 --> 32:19.000
I think the closest one is in the LA area.

32:19.000 --> 32:23.000
That's a shame, because a bunch of the really good...

32:23.000 --> 32:24.000
I may be wrong. Please don't quote me on that.

32:24.000 --> 32:26.000
I don't have the site up in front of me, but yeah.

32:26.000 --> 32:28.000
I think a lot of the...

32:28.000 --> 32:30.000
I mean, this comes from watching a lot of videos

32:30.000 --> 32:32.000
and seeing a lot of people.

32:32.000 --> 32:34.000
But really, do you think that some of the best players

32:34.000 --> 32:36.000
were in the Bay Area?

32:36.000 --> 32:40.000
I think it's good that Konami is finally doing this.

32:40.000 --> 32:43.000
I think they're honestly, sadly, about five years too late.

32:43.000 --> 32:45.000
I think this is something they should have done

32:45.000 --> 32:47.000
when Extreme was out, but fair enough.

32:47.000 --> 32:49.000
They're trying to promote some of their new DDR games.

32:49.000 --> 32:51.000
I think the one mistake they're making...

32:51.000 --> 32:54.000
They didn't give a lot of notice before this tournament happened.

32:54.000 --> 32:56.000
It was literally like,

32:56.000 --> 32:59.000
hey, this is going to start in Texas next week.

32:59.000 --> 33:01.000
It really came out of nowhere,

33:01.000 --> 33:03.000
and I think that's probably one of the biggest mistakes they made.

33:03.000 --> 33:05.000
Whereas if they just would have given it a little time,

33:05.000 --> 33:07.000
like maybe a month to build...

33:07.000 --> 33:09.000
And maybe they did have it out,

33:09.000 --> 33:11.000
and I just didn't hear about it until a week before,

33:11.000 --> 33:13.000
but I don't think there was a lot of notice,

33:13.000 --> 33:15.000
because I want to say the first thing I read on DDRFreak

33:15.000 --> 33:17.000
said it was like, this weekend.

33:17.000 --> 33:21.000
But I think if they'd given it a little more time to breathe,

33:21.000 --> 33:23.000
let the media cover it a little bit.

33:23.000 --> 33:25.000
Let some of the blogs...

33:25.000 --> 33:27.000
Because here's the thing, none of the blogs,

33:27.000 --> 33:29.000
the big, big blogs have said anything about it,

33:29.000 --> 33:31.000
which is unfortunate, because, you know,

33:31.000 --> 33:33.000
you would hope that something like this

33:33.000 --> 33:35.000
would gain a little more notoriety and steam.

33:35.000 --> 33:37.000
This should be a huge tournament.

33:37.000 --> 33:39.000
This should be the size of the tournament

33:39.000 --> 33:41.000
at the end of The Wizard, the movie.

33:41.000 --> 33:44.000
Super Mario 3.

33:44.000 --> 33:46.000
It's so bad.

33:46.000 --> 33:49.000
Von Johnson on Twitter wants to know,

33:49.000 --> 33:51.000
what do you guys think about Borderlands?

33:51.000 --> 33:53.000
You know, I don't know much about this game,

33:53.000 --> 33:55.000
but I did a little bit of research,

33:55.000 --> 33:57.000
just because of your Twitter question.

33:57.000 --> 34:00.000
It's a person shooter, but it also has RPG elements mixed in.

34:00.000 --> 34:03.000
It's being made by Gearbox, and 2K is publishing it,

34:03.000 --> 34:05.000
and it's coming out on PC, of course.

34:05.000 --> 34:08.000
PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, it's coming out in October.

34:08.000 --> 34:10.000
They want to make a franchise out of it,

34:10.000 --> 34:12.000
and honestly, when I'm first looking at this,

34:12.000 --> 34:14.000
just the box art and even some of the screenshots,

34:14.000 --> 34:17.000
I'm kind of like, they're kind of going for the Fallout audience.

34:17.000 --> 34:20.000
This looks a lot like kind of what Fallout is all about.

34:20.000 --> 34:22.000
If I want a Fallout game, I'll play Fallout.

34:22.000 --> 34:24.000
But, you know, it's certainly...

34:24.000 --> 34:26.000
And then I'll throw up, because I get motion sick.

34:26.000 --> 34:29.000
You should know, it does do random level generation.

34:29.000 --> 34:31.000
It's kind of got something like Diablo.

34:31.000 --> 34:33.000
They're kind of saying it was like that.

34:33.000 --> 34:35.000
So, you know, certainly this has its own merits,

34:35.000 --> 34:37.000
so things like that.

34:37.000 --> 34:40.000
A content creation system, which will influence some of the weapons

34:40.000 --> 34:43.000
that you see in game and the game world and the map.

34:43.000 --> 34:46.000
So it sounds like this is something that's going to kind of develop

34:46.000 --> 34:48.000
uniquely for each person.

34:48.000 --> 34:50.000
That sounds kind of cool, especially for an RPG.

34:50.000 --> 34:52.000
That's a little weird.

34:52.000 --> 34:54.000
Weren't some of the dungeons in Fantasy Star,

34:54.000 --> 34:56.000
the earlier Fantasy Star games?

34:56.000 --> 34:58.000
Mmm, that might be true. I think you might be right.

34:58.000 --> 34:59.000
Random generated?

34:59.000 --> 35:01.000
I think it's a nod back to some of the old RPGs,

35:01.000 --> 35:04.000
but even so, if it's a first person shooter,

35:04.000 --> 35:06.000
I'm not going to be into it.

35:06.000 --> 35:08.000
I also do want to point out, though, it has player versus player in it,

35:08.000 --> 35:11.000
which is certainly a huge element that I don't believe Fallout has.

35:11.000 --> 35:15.000
You can actually melee another player to issue a challenge,

35:15.000 --> 35:17.000
and then there'll be a one-on-one duel.

35:17.000 --> 35:21.000
You go to arenas and competitively play with other people.

35:21.000 --> 35:23.000
Fight to the death.

35:23.000 --> 35:26.000
This certainly sounds like kind of an original game,

35:26.000 --> 35:29.000
even though we're making jokes that it sounds a lot like Fallout.

35:29.000 --> 35:31.000
It definitely sounds like it has some unique features

35:31.000 --> 35:33.000
that try to make it set it apart.

35:33.000 --> 35:35.000
So hopefully they release a demo.

35:35.000 --> 35:37.000
That would be my biggest thing.

35:37.000 --> 35:39.000
I probably still wouldn't try it out.

35:39.000 --> 35:41.000
Well, you have the whole motion sick thing going on.

35:41.000 --> 35:43.000
You just don't play first person shooters in general.

35:43.000 --> 35:47.000
I don't play a lot, but there are a few that I got really into,

35:47.000 --> 35:48.000
but most of them are old.

35:48.000 --> 35:51.000
And then they're going to be anytime soon, as long as Dan's got ODST.

35:51.000 --> 35:53.000
Quake, Duke Nukem, 3D.

35:53.000 --> 35:55.000
Those are the games I'm talking about that I got into.

35:55.000 --> 35:56.000
I haven't gotten into a shooter.

35:56.000 --> 35:57.000
I played a little bit of Halo.

35:57.000 --> 36:00.000
The last one I played any severe amount of was Hexen.

36:00.000 --> 36:03.000
Now that is an old school shooting game.

36:03.000 --> 36:06.000
I wish there would be a game like that again.

36:06.000 --> 36:09.000
Like the whole magical, mystical first person shooter type of thing.

36:09.000 --> 36:10.000
That was a rad game.

36:10.000 --> 36:11.000
Hexen was great.

36:11.000 --> 36:13.000
Just the whole problem being, you know,

36:13.000 --> 36:17.000
that was still sprite based and, you know.

36:17.000 --> 36:21.000
Wasn't Heretic 2 the one that they did?

36:21.000 --> 36:22.000
They moved to 3D?

36:22.000 --> 36:25.000
Yes.

36:25.000 --> 36:29.000
Doctor of War C, or Doctor of Work on Twitter,

36:29.000 --> 36:31.000
who has a cute little chibi squirtle icon,

36:31.000 --> 36:34.000
wants to know the last CD or song you bought.

36:34.000 --> 36:36.000
I said anything goes.

36:36.000 --> 36:38.000
Last CD or song you bought.

36:38.000 --> 36:42.000
Um... physical CD?

36:42.000 --> 36:45.000
Oh god, I can't even remember the last physical CD I bought.

36:45.000 --> 36:46.000
That was too long ago.

36:46.000 --> 36:47.000
I can tell you the last... go ahead.

36:47.000 --> 36:49.000
The World's Greatest Mashups Part 2.

36:49.000 --> 36:50.000
Really?

36:50.000 --> 36:51.000
Yes.

36:51.000 --> 36:52.000
Nice.

36:52.000 --> 36:59.000
As far as an actual song, I bought actually what my cage match pick was.

36:59.000 --> 37:01.000
Which didn't win, I'm sorry to tell you.

37:01.000 --> 37:04.000
Loki picked some song out of thin air and we both lost by one vote.

37:04.000 --> 37:05.000
He pulled it out of his ass.

37:05.000 --> 37:06.000
He did. He always does.

37:06.000 --> 37:08.000
But it was all the Kylie stuff.

37:08.000 --> 37:09.000
Yeah.

37:09.000 --> 37:12.000
I would say the last song I bought, funny enough,

37:12.000 --> 37:13.000
there's a story behind this.

37:13.000 --> 37:16.000
The last song I bought was Limbo Rock by Chubby Checker.

37:16.000 --> 37:18.000
Yes, that's right.

37:18.000 --> 37:20.000
No joke. Go back.

37:20.000 --> 37:22.000
It's in my iTunes receipt.

37:22.000 --> 37:26.000
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo.

37:26.000 --> 37:28.000
I wish I had it on this computer. I'd play it.

37:28.000 --> 37:30.000
But it was actually, it was for Rocky.

37:30.000 --> 37:34.000
I bought it because there was a new little pre-show game we did

37:34.000 --> 37:36.000
that was the Limbo, so I had to get the song for that.

37:36.000 --> 37:37.000
But that's the last song I bought.

37:37.000 --> 37:38.000
What was your last physical CD?

37:38.000 --> 37:40.000
I don't remember the last physical CD.

37:40.000 --> 37:43.000
The last iTunes CD I bought was Ellipse by Image and Heap.

37:43.000 --> 37:44.000
I know that.

37:44.000 --> 37:46.000
But as far as CD I actually...

37:46.000 --> 37:52.000
Oh, so the last download CD that I got was Regina Spector.

37:52.000 --> 37:57.000
I actually think the last physical CD I bought was

37:57.000 --> 38:00.000
Flavors of Entanglement by Alanis Morissette,

38:00.000 --> 38:02.000
and that came out like a year ago.

38:02.000 --> 38:03.000
I just don't really buy physical CDs.

38:03.000 --> 38:05.000
Now that I think about it, I'm pretty sure that it wasn't,

38:05.000 --> 38:08.000
the mashups disc was the last one that I bought.

38:08.000 --> 38:10.000
But I'll be damned if I can remember what it is.

38:10.000 --> 38:12.000
I know what it was, Video Games Live.

38:12.000 --> 38:13.000
Oh.

38:13.000 --> 38:15.000
I bought it at...

38:15.000 --> 38:16.000
There you go.

38:16.000 --> 38:17.000
At the concert.

38:17.000 --> 38:18.000
There you go.

38:18.000 --> 38:22.000
And that's a great place to get physical CDs,

38:22.000 --> 38:25.000
is at concerts, because sometimes you can get them to sign them there.

38:25.000 --> 38:27.000
SimsLovah wants to know,

38:27.000 --> 38:30.000
what games are you excited about for next month?

38:30.000 --> 38:32.000
I'm still catching up on last month.

38:32.000 --> 38:34.000
I haven't been able to play crap.

38:34.000 --> 38:36.000
You were out because of your hand.

38:36.000 --> 38:39.000
Yep. I am still kind of out on my hand.

38:39.000 --> 38:41.000
You never even played Marvel Ultimate Alliance, did you?

38:41.000 --> 38:43.000
No. In fact, look. Right here.

38:43.000 --> 38:44.000
Look at this.

38:44.000 --> 38:46.000
Oh my god, a sealed copy.

38:46.000 --> 38:50.000
And I really freaking want to play it so I can get my Deadpool on.

38:50.000 --> 38:51.000
Poor thing.

38:51.000 --> 38:54.000
I think my team is going to be Deadpool and

38:54.000 --> 39:01.000
Ms. Marvel and Phoenix and Captain America.

39:01.000 --> 39:03.000
I never played Ultimate Alliance 1.

39:03.000 --> 39:05.000
So when you finally crack that open, I need to come over and play it with you.

39:05.000 --> 39:08.000
Yes you do, because I'm going to need you to help me pass the levels

39:08.000 --> 39:11.000
and get me achievements and whatnot.

39:11.000 --> 39:12.000
Look, Deadpool.

39:12.000 --> 39:14.000
What if I suck at it? I've never played it.

39:14.000 --> 39:16.000
Trust me, there's no real way to suck at this game.

39:16.000 --> 39:17.000
It's just butt mashing?

39:17.000 --> 39:18.000
It's mashing.

39:18.000 --> 39:19.000
Alright, fine.

39:19.000 --> 39:23.000
Really, in looking at the releases, DJ Hero clearly is a game I want to get.

39:23.000 --> 39:25.000
Also, kind of slipping under the radar,

39:25.000 --> 39:27.000
there's a lot of big releases between Gran Turismo, PSP,

39:27.000 --> 39:30.000
Uncharted 2 certainly is going to be worth a look.

39:30.000 --> 39:33.000
But I do want to point out Demon's Souls is coming out on the PlayStation 3.

39:33.000 --> 39:35.000
That was a game I checked out at E3.

39:35.000 --> 39:37.000
I think it's been out in Japan for a little while,

39:37.000 --> 39:38.000
but they're adapting it over here.

39:38.000 --> 39:40.000
It's like an RPG, but it's supposed to be super hard.

39:40.000 --> 39:43.000
And especially with White Knight Chronicles getting pushed back to next year,

39:43.000 --> 39:45.000
I think I do want to pick up Demon's Souls and check it out.

39:45.000 --> 39:50.000
That's actually a PlayStation 3 exclusive, if I remember correct.

39:50.000 --> 39:52.000
Nutman wants to know in chat.

39:52.000 --> 39:53.000
Yes, that's the name.

39:53.000 --> 39:54.000
I'm sorry, not chat.

39:54.000 --> 39:55.000
That's Twitter again.

39:55.000 --> 39:59.000
For Rob, a question just for me.

39:59.000 --> 40:01.000
Would you go straight for Alicia Keys?

40:01.000 --> 40:03.000
Be honest.

40:03.000 --> 40:07.000
No, I have to say no.

40:07.000 --> 40:09.000
Not for Alicia Keys.

40:09.000 --> 40:14.000
And I could get into this whole tirade about I don't really believe there is

40:14.000 --> 40:17.000
going straight in quotes or going gay.

40:17.000 --> 40:21.000
There is just liking who you want to like, as I call it.

40:21.000 --> 40:27.000
I go ahead and classify myself gay because I like guys, mostly.

40:27.000 --> 40:33.000
But I'm not going to say I would never, ever, ever, ever, ever want to kiss a girl.

40:33.000 --> 40:36.000
You have a witness in this room.

40:36.000 --> 40:40.000
But Alicia Keys I don't think would be the one, that's for sure.

40:40.000 --> 40:44.000
Anyhow, I'll save the sexuality tangent for another day.

40:44.000 --> 40:47.000
I don't think people signed up for this podcast to hear that talk.

40:47.000 --> 40:49.000
I don't think she's that cute.

40:49.000 --> 40:52.000
Petrek85 wants to know, um, duh, guh.

40:52.000 --> 40:53.000
That's exactly what they put.

40:53.000 --> 40:54.000
Um, duh, guh.

40:54.000 --> 40:56.000
What's your favorite colors?

40:56.000 --> 40:57.000
New game smell.

40:57.000 --> 40:58.000
Ooh, new game smell.

40:58.000 --> 40:59.000
She unwrapped.

40:59.000 --> 41:00.000
Favorite color?

41:00.000 --> 41:01.000
Black.

41:01.000 --> 41:04.000
Like my soul!

41:04.000 --> 41:06.000
Uh, dark forest green.

41:06.000 --> 41:08.000
I'm actually really fond of dark, dark red.

41:08.000 --> 41:14.000
There's actually an in-joke amongst a lot of my friends that I always wear earth colors.

41:14.000 --> 41:20.000
Like, I pretty much always am wearing brown, green, black, you know, like earthy colors.

41:20.000 --> 41:21.000
You're not today.

41:21.000 --> 41:23.000
Funny enough, today I'm wearing all blue.

41:23.000 --> 41:26.000
I have a, like, little blue stripey shirt and blue jeans on today.

41:26.000 --> 41:28.000
I'm wearing gray.

41:28.000 --> 41:30.000
Even down to my warm fuzzy socks.

41:30.000 --> 41:32.000
It's like the weather today, but the weather today is gray.

41:32.000 --> 41:33.000
Are you feeling okay?

41:33.000 --> 41:37.000
I just grabbed something comfortable to paint in because I have my class today.

41:37.000 --> 41:38.000
Nice.

41:38.000 --> 41:43.000
I have to, I tend to wear my older clothes on Tuesdays and Thursdays because I know that

41:43.000 --> 41:46.000
I'm just gonna go get paint all over them, which amazingly enough I didn't get any paint

41:46.000 --> 41:48.000
on myself today.

41:48.000 --> 41:49.000
Uh-

41:49.000 --> 41:51.000
Acrylic is a bitch to wash out.

41:51.000 --> 41:54.000
I got one more question on the Twitter that just came in a little bit ago while we've

41:54.000 --> 41:56.000
been taping, and I'll give this one more reload before we sign off tonight.

41:56.000 --> 41:57.000
This is fun.

41:57.000 --> 41:59.000
I like this for a random show when there's not a lot of news.

41:59.000 --> 42:00.000
Um, okay.

42:00.000 --> 42:01.000
Soda or pop?

42:01.000 --> 42:02.000
Asks spazinator.

42:02.000 --> 42:04.000
PSN on Twitter.

42:04.000 --> 42:05.000
I, soda.

42:05.000 --> 42:06.000
Easy.

42:06.000 --> 42:08.000
I hate, I hate pop.

42:08.000 --> 42:10.000
I hate it when people call it pop.

42:10.000 --> 42:11.000
Like, it just bugs me.

42:11.000 --> 42:12.000
It's like nails on a chalkboard.

42:12.000 --> 42:14.000
Pop is what you do to bubble gum.

42:14.000 --> 42:17.000
Pop is what you do to bubbles when somebody blows them.

42:17.000 --> 42:18.000
Technically-

42:18.000 --> 42:19.000
Pop goes the weasel.

42:19.000 --> 42:20.000
The name is soda pop.

42:20.000 --> 42:21.000
I get that, but it just sounds weird.

42:21.000 --> 42:25.000
But, this is where I start giving the cultural lesson on growing up in Alabama.

42:25.000 --> 42:26.000
Mm-hmm.

42:26.000 --> 42:31.000
Because my little, especially my part of Alabama had Coca-Cola bottling company plant.

42:31.000 --> 42:39.000
So every drink, every soda in, and yes, I do prefer soda, every soda in the South is

42:39.000 --> 42:40.000
called Coke.

42:40.000 --> 42:41.000
It doesn't matter.

42:41.000 --> 42:42.000
It's all Coke.

42:42.000 --> 42:46.000
And I'm okay with that even, even though I prefer Pepsi.

42:46.000 --> 42:48.000
Pepsi is so much better because Coke tastes like poo.

42:48.000 --> 42:54.000
But, but now though, when I go into a restaurant and it throws people off so much.

42:54.000 --> 42:55.000
Let's see.

42:55.000 --> 42:57.000
Um, you know, can I get you a drink?

42:57.000 --> 42:59.000
I'd like a Diet Cola.

42:59.000 --> 43:00.000
Ah, Cola.

43:00.000 --> 43:02.000
That's one you don't hear a lot.

43:02.000 --> 43:06.000
Because I don't like, I don't really care for the Sprite type drinks, you know.

43:06.000 --> 43:10.000
But I'll say I would like a Diet Cola, whichever one you have.

43:10.000 --> 43:13.000
So that way they won't do, is Coke okay?

43:13.000 --> 43:14.000
Is Pepsi okay?

43:14.000 --> 43:16.000
I just said whichever one.

43:16.000 --> 43:18.000
I don't care.

43:18.000 --> 43:21.000
You know, there's a, you know, they have to do that though, because plenty of people bitch

43:21.000 --> 43:22.000
about it when it's not the right one.

43:22.000 --> 43:27.000
But, but I, that's why I specify and you've heard me do it.

43:27.000 --> 43:30.000
I will take a Diet Cola, whichever one you have.

43:30.000 --> 43:32.000
That's a blanket permission.

43:32.000 --> 43:38.000
If you don't have Coke or Pepsi, but you have RC Cola, by all means, give me the RC.

43:38.000 --> 43:43.000
Which by the way, I was going to say, when I hear the word Cola, I think of RC Cola and

43:43.000 --> 43:47.000
I think of Shasta Cola, which I don't even think they probably sell outside of Merkle.

43:47.000 --> 43:50.000
Do you remember Faggo?

43:50.000 --> 43:51.000
Root beer.

43:51.000 --> 43:53.000
That would be, what about just saying root beer?

43:53.000 --> 43:54.000
Here's the thing though.

43:54.000 --> 43:58.000
Honestly, Spasinator, if I was smarter, I wouldn't order soda at all.

43:58.000 --> 44:01.000
Honestly, soda's not really that good for you.

44:01.000 --> 44:04.000
You really shouldn't have more than one a day.

44:04.000 --> 44:08.000
So just kind of throwing that out there, because I know that with the whole video game stereotype,

44:08.000 --> 44:10.000
there's people that chug Mountain Dew's.

44:10.000 --> 44:14.000
So if you know you're the type of person that chugs Mountain Dew's, and then you're like,

44:14.000 --> 44:16.000
when did my butt get so big?

44:16.000 --> 44:18.000
Then it's probably because you're chugging Mountain Dew's.

44:18.000 --> 44:20.000
So not to slam on Mountain Dew.

44:20.000 --> 44:22.000
I love those drinks as much as anyone else.

44:22.000 --> 44:24.000
But seriously, look how many calories are in one of those.

44:24.000 --> 44:29.000
There's as much calories in one of those drinks as there is in a candy bar.

44:29.000 --> 44:35.000
Rob, I have to give up my diet soda and my coffee and black tea.

44:35.000 --> 44:37.000
Oh my gosh, you poor thing.

44:37.000 --> 44:38.000
I can have green tea.

44:38.000 --> 44:40.000
Can you have Sprite?

44:40.000 --> 44:43.000
What's the point? Caffeine.

44:43.000 --> 44:47.000
The only type of caffeinated drink I'm supposed to have is green tea.

44:47.000 --> 44:49.000
I'm like, the hell with that. I'm having coffee.

44:49.000 --> 44:53.000
But I'll have my one cup of coffee in the morning. One.

44:53.000 --> 44:56.000
We got a few good questions from our chat room, actually.

44:56.000 --> 44:57.000
Who cares? Bye.

44:57.000 --> 45:00.000
Shut up. I was talking with a few of the chatters before the show,

45:00.000 --> 45:02.000
and actually we got some really good questions from chat.

45:02.000 --> 45:05.000
Three of them came from the Rob D, but these are all good discussion questions.

45:05.000 --> 45:08.000
Rob D's just a smart and articulate guy, anyway.

45:08.000 --> 45:11.000
I really enjoy when he calls into the show. He's a smart guy,

45:11.000 --> 45:14.000
and obviously I've gotten to hang out with him a couple times.

45:14.000 --> 45:15.000
Penny Arcade Expo.

45:15.000 --> 45:16.000
We had really good Chinese food.

45:16.000 --> 45:18.000
And Asen. I got to see him again.

45:18.000 --> 45:21.000
So he's a good guy. I wish his show would come back.

45:21.000 --> 45:26.000
That was a slick show, this day in gaming that he had.

45:26.000 --> 45:28.000
I was trying to remember what it stood for.

45:28.000 --> 45:30.000
This day in gaming that he had, it was a slick show.

45:30.000 --> 45:34.000
He has a really good voice for radio, and the guy that edited it did a really good job.

45:34.000 --> 45:38.000
Anyhow, Rob D asks in chat, first thing he said,

45:38.000 --> 45:42.000
what is your favorite Japanese media depiction of an American?

45:42.000 --> 45:44.000
That's a good question.

45:44.000 --> 45:48.000
Mine is and will forever be Terry Bogard.

45:48.000 --> 45:51.000
I don't know. This is one I'd really have to give some thought to.

45:51.000 --> 45:53.000
I can't think of any big stereotypes that jump out at me.

45:53.000 --> 45:59.000
I would have to say from Axis Powers Hetalia, America,

45:59.000 --> 46:02.000
who is always sitting in the corner eating cheeseburgers

46:02.000 --> 46:06.000
and giving emphatic orders.

46:06.000 --> 46:08.000
I'm going to take the question in a different direction here.

46:08.000 --> 46:11.000
It's not my favorite Japanese media depiction of an American,

46:11.000 --> 46:16.000
but my favorite British depiction of an American was Bubbles from Absolutely Fabulous.

46:16.000 --> 46:19.000
I'm sure none of our listeners are going to get that reference,

46:19.000 --> 46:24.000
but that was my favorite depiction of an American.

46:24.000 --> 46:28.000
The only thing that's coming to mind, and it's not even her depicting an American,

46:28.000 --> 46:34.000
it's her depicting a Welsh.

46:34.000 --> 46:40.000
It's Dawn French doing her imitation of Catherine Zeta Jones,

46:40.000 --> 46:44.000
but slipping into a fully California American axis.

46:44.000 --> 46:47.000
She says, oh, my California's showing.

46:47.000 --> 46:49.000
Nice.

46:49.000 --> 46:52.000
I have to do it right.

46:52.000 --> 46:54.000
Catherine Zeta Douglas.

46:54.000 --> 46:56.000
I lost it.

46:56.000 --> 46:58.000
Is this something people can look up on YouTube or something?

46:58.000 --> 47:00.000
Catherine Zeta Douglas Spartacus Jones.

47:00.000 --> 47:01.000
Spartacus Jones?

47:01.000 --> 47:02.000
Yes.

47:02.000 --> 47:03.000
Nice.

47:03.000 --> 47:07.000
Just look up Dawn French or French and Saunders and Catherine Zeta Jones.

47:07.000 --> 47:09.000
It's hilarious.

47:09.000 --> 47:11.000
Especially the roundabout one.

47:11.000 --> 47:12.000
That one's funny.

47:12.000 --> 47:15.000
Here's another good question from our articulate friend.

47:15.000 --> 47:20.000
Overall, do you think the internet gaming community has helped or stunted the gaming industry?

47:20.000 --> 47:24.000
I see the zeitgeist that has sprung up from the sites and forums we have today,

47:24.000 --> 47:26.000
and honestly, it makes me sad.

47:26.000 --> 47:32.000
Everyone complains about everything, and that drives sales down because of social pressure.

47:32.000 --> 47:41.000
I think it's a necessary evil, and I know that's totally like I just picked none of the above in a way,

47:41.000 --> 47:46.000
which is sad, but the problem is that it's not just the gaming industry that I think has to deal with this.

47:46.000 --> 47:50.000
The movie industry, to a certain extent, definitely has to deal with this big time.

47:50.000 --> 47:55.000
Sites like Ain'tItCoolNews.com or everybody's got a movie blog, it seems these days,

47:55.000 --> 48:02.000
and bitchy people like Perez Hilton and some of these gossip blogs will oftentimes ruin a movie

48:02.000 --> 48:06.000
before it comes out with spoilers and things that it stinks.

48:06.000 --> 48:07.000
Think about it.

48:07.000 --> 48:11.000
I know most of us, even I'm too young to remember this,

48:11.000 --> 48:19.000
but when The Empire Strikes Back originally came out, or no, Return of the Jedi originally came out,

48:19.000 --> 48:22.000
and it was revealed that Darth Vader was Luke's father.

48:22.000 --> 48:24.000
That was Empire Strikes Back.

48:24.000 --> 48:25.000
Sorry, leading into Return of the Jedi.

48:25.000 --> 48:27.000
I remember this.

48:27.000 --> 48:30.000
That was such a huge fucking thing.

48:30.000 --> 48:34.000
Like, oh my gosh, what a shock, what a surprise.

48:34.000 --> 48:36.000
That would not be possible in this day and age.

48:36.000 --> 48:37.000
Think about it.

48:37.000 --> 48:41.000
A huge reveal like that would have been spoiled on the internet a month before the movie was released.

48:41.000 --> 48:43.000
Snape killed Dumbledore.

48:43.000 --> 48:44.000
Exactly.

48:44.000 --> 48:47.000
It was on T-shirts by the time the book came out.

48:47.000 --> 48:49.000
Snape kills Dumbledore, page 200 and something something.

48:49.000 --> 48:52.000
And sorry if that was truly a spoiler to you, but seriously, how long has it been on you?

48:52.000 --> 48:57.000
If you haven't read it by now, there's got to be some type of moratorium on spoilers.

48:57.000 --> 49:01.000
Like, if it's been out for two years and you still haven't done it, you're going to get spoiled.

49:01.000 --> 49:06.000
Well, that's why I did very well to hide myself.

49:06.000 --> 49:12.000
I mean, even though I figured out that something like that was going to happen from the freaking beginning of the damn book,

49:12.000 --> 49:19.000
hi, especially when the last book came out.

49:19.000 --> 49:27.000
I hid myself in a hole and made sure to read everything that day before I let myself read anything on the internet.

49:27.000 --> 49:33.000
But it's interesting because even though you know that, and even if I just spoiled that for you,

49:33.000 --> 49:39.000
which I'm sure I wasn't the first person to do so, that's not going to ruin what was a good book.

49:39.000 --> 49:45.000
Just like knowing that Darth Vader is Luke's father is not going to ruin that movie.

49:45.000 --> 49:49.000
It's still a good movie and really good stuff will hold up amongst all the spoilers.

49:49.000 --> 49:51.000
But I'm digressing a little bit. I apologize.

49:51.000 --> 49:55.000
I'm just kind of trying to say this isn't really something that's specific to the gaming industry, in my opinion.

49:55.000 --> 50:05.000
This is internet culture and live performances, television, every artistic foray,

50:05.000 --> 50:08.000
which yes, gaming is one. We can have that discussion another day if you want.

50:08.000 --> 50:15.000
It is subject to this scrutiny that is the blogosphere that we live in now.

50:15.000 --> 50:17.000
It's just the way it is.

50:17.000 --> 50:22.000
I think companies to overcome that kind of have to be smart in how they do things.

50:22.000 --> 50:24.000
But it's really hard to keep a secret.

50:24.000 --> 50:30.000
Look at what happened to Sony and having everything spoiled, except Final Fantasy XIV was one of the only secrets they had.

50:30.000 --> 50:33.000
Most of their big things were spoiled.

50:33.000 --> 50:37.000
And now you had this whole Sega Sony thing we talked about on the show last week.

50:37.000 --> 50:39.000
That was a huge spoiler thing, too.

50:39.000 --> 50:41.000
It's very hard to keep a secret anymore.

50:41.000 --> 50:44.000
But if the product is really, really good, it's going to transcend all that.

50:44.000 --> 50:46.000
Yeah, I totally agree with that.

50:46.000 --> 50:51.000
Because how many people who had their Harry Potter spoilers still went out and got the book?

50:51.000 --> 50:55.000
So going back to the original question, because we totally digressed from the question and probably missed the point.

50:55.000 --> 50:59.000
Has the gaming community helped or stunted the gaming industry?

50:59.000 --> 51:01.000
In the end, it doesn't matter.

51:01.000 --> 51:03.000
It's not a switch we can turn off.

51:03.000 --> 51:08.000
But I would honestly say the answer is a little of column A and a little of column B.

51:08.000 --> 51:13.000
It's probably made things better as far as promoting.

51:13.000 --> 51:24.000
I think games like Scribblenauts, Braid, some of these games, I don't think would have sold as well or been quite as talked about if it weren't for the internet.

51:24.000 --> 51:29.000
I think the concepts of some of these games wouldn't have even existed if not for the internet.

51:29.000 --> 51:35.000
Scribblenauts itself has so many internet jokes in it. Hi!

51:35.000 --> 51:37.000
But has it hurt things? Sure.

51:37.000 --> 51:39.000
Has it hurt sales of some games? Sure.

51:39.000 --> 51:44.000
But honestly, I don't even know if that's the blog so much as it is probably just piracy.

51:44.000 --> 51:47.000
Straight up piracy is easy to do, you know?

51:47.000 --> 51:49.000
Anyhow, that's a good question.

51:49.000 --> 51:51.000
Want to do one more from the Rob D?

51:51.000 --> 51:52.000
Sure.

51:52.000 --> 51:55.000
Along the same lines, has online multiplayer helped or hurt gaming?

51:55.000 --> 52:00.000
Before, a good game could have glitches and they would be ignored or even revered.

52:00.000 --> 52:06.000
Now people will complain that it needs a patch because it will be abused if there's an online component.

52:06.000 --> 52:11.000
I think it's just a sign of the times. I mean, I really think that it's just the evolution.

52:11.000 --> 52:16.000
You know, you move in one direction, you're going to have problems that come because of it, you know?

52:16.000 --> 52:19.000
I really think that you can't have one without the other.

52:19.000 --> 52:22.000
So I don't really see it as a hurt or help.

52:22.000 --> 52:28.000
I'm going to plant myself firmly in the column of I believe multiplayer gaming has helped gaming altogether.

52:28.000 --> 52:32.000
I think it's created genres of gaming that really wouldn't exist otherwise.

52:32.000 --> 52:34.000
I think it hurt arcades.

52:34.000 --> 52:38.000
I think multiplayer gaming and the online stuff, I think it hurt arcades.

52:38.000 --> 52:40.000
And I think that's what finally put the nail in the coffin of arcades.

52:40.000 --> 52:42.000
I think it hurt people's social life.

52:42.000 --> 52:45.000
But I think it helped gaming in general.

52:45.000 --> 52:48.000
I mean, let's face it. What is the Xbox 360's biggest strength?

52:48.000 --> 52:49.000
Online.

52:49.000 --> 52:53.000
Online is online. And what is a lot of people, you know, what made it so successful,

52:53.000 --> 52:56.000
especially in the beginning over the PlayStation 3,

52:56.000 --> 53:03.000
complain all you will about how Sony maybe botched the launch of the PlayStation 3 that they're trying to make amends for now.

53:03.000 --> 53:07.000
But the online component has always been Xbox 360's greatest strength.

53:07.000 --> 53:11.000
What is the one thing most of us are most critical about with the Wii?

53:11.000 --> 53:12.000
The lack of online.

53:12.000 --> 53:16.000
The lack of online and the lack of ability to patch games and the lack of, you know,

53:16.000 --> 53:20.000
we kind of see that as not catering to the hardcore audience.

53:20.000 --> 53:25.000
They said, though, from the get-go that it's not for the hardcore audience.

53:25.000 --> 53:30.000
But honestly, I've kind of made friends with online games, as strange as that sounds.

53:30.000 --> 53:31.000
I know, I have.

53:31.000 --> 53:36.000
Yeah, I mean, I've met people on, like, LiveJournal that I'll go off and, you know,

53:36.000 --> 53:41.000
join my guild in Final Fantasy XI or World of Warcraft or what have you that I've become really good friends with.

53:41.000 --> 53:47.000
Well, just along the same token, a lot of the people that I've made friends with out here,

53:47.000 --> 53:52.000
they were my online buddies in Alabama, you know, through playing Gemstone.

53:52.000 --> 53:53.000
Oh, wow.

53:53.000 --> 53:54.000
How's that for old school?

53:54.000 --> 53:55.000
That is very old school.

53:55.000 --> 53:59.000
Or, you know, doing the silly little games on AOL, you know.

53:59.000 --> 54:01.000
Nice.

54:01.000 --> 54:07.000
I met a lot of people who are now my in-person friends, but I met them online.

54:07.000 --> 54:09.000
You know, Dan.

54:09.000 --> 54:10.000
Your husband you met online.

54:10.000 --> 54:11.000
My husband, I met online.

54:11.000 --> 54:17.000
So, I think that while this may have hurt face-to-face social interaction,

54:17.000 --> 54:24.000
I think that it has opened the doors for people who otherwise would not get out of the house, you know.

54:24.000 --> 54:27.000
I'm trying to think if I want to open this little Pandora's box here,

54:27.000 --> 54:32.000
but let me kind of take a step away from gaming for a minute and this whole, like, internet social thing.

54:32.000 --> 54:35.000
As a gay man, the internet's been huge.

54:35.000 --> 54:42.000
Because I think especially, like, you know, where it's not something you can just...

54:42.000 --> 54:47.000
It's sometimes kind of hard to meet other gay people because not everybody kind of is, like, out with it

54:47.000 --> 54:49.000
and a lot of people have to suppress it out there in society.

54:49.000 --> 54:51.000
I think the internet's helped a lot of people connect.

54:51.000 --> 54:53.000
And I don't think that's necessarily limited to gay culture.

54:53.000 --> 54:58.000
That goes for a lot of, like, fans of anything.

54:58.000 --> 55:00.000
Or lifestyle...

55:00.000 --> 55:03.000
Well, a lot of fringe groups too, you know.

55:03.000 --> 55:06.000
People who may think, oh, I'm the only one, I'm the only one.

55:06.000 --> 55:10.000
You find out there's other people like you, you know.

55:10.000 --> 55:20.000
I think it's fantastic for, especially not just as a social tool, but as a socially informative tool, you know what I mean?

55:20.000 --> 55:24.000
So in a way, what Jamie and I are saying right here kind of goes back to answer this question.

55:24.000 --> 55:29.000
Because gaming would be another type of community where you're able to find people like you,

55:29.000 --> 55:32.000
you know, that are into the same types of games that you are.

55:32.000 --> 55:34.000
You know, kind of combining them both.

55:34.000 --> 55:39.000
One of the most, one of my favorite websites, the most awesome communities I've been to is gaygamer.net.

55:39.000 --> 55:45.000
You know, because I'm able to meet, like, other gay geeks like myself, which is ironic because I actually don't go there a whole lot anymore.

55:45.000 --> 55:48.000
But I went to, like, a party they had once and I had a lot of fun.

55:48.000 --> 55:54.000
And it was kind of cool because, you know, sometimes in gamer culture, I feel like the underdog for being gay

55:54.000 --> 55:57.000
and you sign on Xbox Live, fag, fag, fag, you know, you hear all that stuff.

55:57.000 --> 56:01.000
And then as the gay guy, I sometimes feel like being a nerd, I'm on the bottom rung.

56:01.000 --> 56:06.000
Because I'm not a fashionista. I don't, you know, go to every Madonna concert and all this stuff.

56:06.000 --> 56:07.000
You know what I mean?

56:07.000 --> 56:08.000
I know what you mean.

56:08.000 --> 56:12.000
That's why I rolled my eyes because I see way too much of it, you know.

56:12.000 --> 56:17.000
Don't cry for me, Argentina. This happens in any social structure, not just the ones I've mentioned.

56:17.000 --> 56:21.000
But I think the internet has allowed us to find people like us and gaming is a part of that.

56:21.000 --> 56:25.000
Think about it. What about the community we have here at Orange Lounge Radio?

56:25.000 --> 56:28.000
We've met a lot of awesome people just because they've listened to our show.

56:28.000 --> 56:31.000
She's an example directly through a game.

56:31.000 --> 56:36.000
One of my friends that I played on the IRO back in the day, on the International Ragnarok Server,

56:36.000 --> 56:40.000
she's, we haven't met, you know, she lives in Canada, so we haven't met face to face.

56:40.000 --> 56:41.000
I've never been up there.

56:41.000 --> 56:47.000
But we're still friends on DeviantArt and through LiveJournal, you know, we still keep in touch.

56:47.000 --> 56:51.000
And I'm talking, you know, seven years ago.

56:51.000 --> 56:58.000
So I've made, even though, you know, these are people that I would never have come into contact with,

56:58.000 --> 57:07.000
people of vast talent, like, you know, for example, I met Tiara online.

57:07.000 --> 57:12.000
You know, we were friends online before we'd ever gotten to meet in person.

57:12.000 --> 57:19.000
And, you know, now, you know, we hang out whenever we can go to each other's towns or go to Disneyland.

57:19.000 --> 57:21.000
But it's pretty cool, you know.

57:21.000 --> 57:29.000
I've made really lasting friendships through, you know, online networking and through, you know, games.

57:29.000 --> 57:32.000
So, meh.

57:32.000 --> 57:34.000
One more question tonight.

57:34.000 --> 57:36.000
That was a good discussion.

57:36.000 --> 57:38.000
This one comes from Dark Tetsuya.

57:38.000 --> 57:44.000
And the question is, how likely are you guys to be checking out La Mulana when it hits WiiWare when it's available?

57:44.000 --> 57:48.000
I did read the difficulty, at least of the controls, has been adjusted.

57:48.000 --> 57:51.000
I really wish there were demos, but that's a whole bigger issue.

57:51.000 --> 57:55.000
I still have some extra Wii points from a gift card someone was kind enough to give me for my birthday,

57:55.000 --> 57:57.000
so I'll probably use it to pick up this game.

57:57.000 --> 57:59.000
Because I do love kind of the retro gamey goodness.

57:59.000 --> 58:04.000
And what I've seen of La Mulana, I've actually watched Dark Tetsuya play a little bit of it on his channel.

58:04.000 --> 58:07.000
It looks fun, so I'll check it out. Why not?

58:07.000 --> 58:11.000
It has to be better than that BitBoy game I can't believe I actually spent points on.

58:11.000 --> 58:14.000
I'm still thinking about it.

58:14.000 --> 58:21.000
Just right now, me playing much of anything is in small doses that I have to be able to take a lot of rest with.

58:21.000 --> 58:24.000
Why isn't there a Nintendo magazine that comes with demos?

58:24.000 --> 58:27.000
You know, they do this on the Xbox. They do this on the PlayStation.

58:27.000 --> 58:33.000
Granted, those discs got made a little obsolete in this era of gaming because we all download our demos online.

58:33.000 --> 58:36.000
But remember on PlayStation 1, those demo discs used to be the shit.

58:36.000 --> 58:38.000
I have a pile of them.

58:38.000 --> 58:39.000
They're awesome.

58:39.000 --> 58:44.000
Why doesn't Nintendo do something like that to make up for the lack of having an online thing?

58:44.000 --> 58:46.000
I don't get that.

58:46.000 --> 58:50.000
Wouldn't that be cool if they had a magazine that would have like five games you could play on a disc?

58:50.000 --> 58:52.000
They're too busy kissing Miyamoto's ass.

58:52.000 --> 58:56.000
Or kissing Soccer Mom's ass or something. I don't know.

58:56.000 --> 58:59.000
Let me just reload the Twitter real quick to see if we got any other last questions.

58:59.000 --> 59:00.000
No, we didn't.

59:00.000 --> 59:02.000
Jeremy keeps trying to get out of the room and then she's like,

59:02.000 --> 59:04.000
Ah, the door!

59:04.000 --> 59:06.000
And then turning back around.

59:06.000 --> 59:09.000
I think we're going to go ahead and wrap up. We've been taping for about an hour now.

59:09.000 --> 59:11.000
Are we going to wrap it up in ribbons and bows?

59:11.000 --> 59:13.000
Yes, we are. We're going to sign, seal, and deliver it.

59:13.000 --> 59:16.000
But this is fun. This is a good little chat. Those are really good questions, guys.

59:16.000 --> 59:17.000
So, thank you.

59:17.000 --> 59:21.000
It's nice to know that when we need to, we can pull a show out of our butt just by saying,

59:21.000 --> 59:23.000
Hey guys, ask us questions.

59:23.000 --> 59:25.000
And that's all the community right there.

59:25.000 --> 59:27.000
You know what this means?

59:27.000 --> 59:35.000
To sort of tease a little bit an idea that I brought up to you on Sunday about a little one hour thing involving a room in my house.

59:35.000 --> 59:37.000
That would make it entirely possible.

59:37.000 --> 59:42.000
It would. There could be plenty of good, fun things in store for us in 2010. We'll see.

59:42.000 --> 59:44.000
So, thanks to everybody for the questions.

59:44.000 --> 59:47.000
If I somehow missed your questions, I'm sorry, we'll roll it over to another show.

59:47.000 --> 59:50.000
Don't forget, you can always send us an email. Mailbag at OrangeLaunchRadio.com.

59:50.000 --> 59:56.000
And thank you guys so much for tuning into our show tonight, even though we weren't live or downloading it, even though it was a little different tonight.

59:56.000 --> 59:58.000
I hope you guys have a great week.

59:58.000 --> 01:00:03.000
We'll be back to do our normal show one week from Sunday, which would be October.

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:08.000
We need to bring back our missing houseguest, the ferret.

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:10.000
Oh, the ferret.

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:11.000
To join the ranks of the-

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:14.000
Do you miss the ferret more than Loki? Is that what you're trying to say?

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:18.000
No. No. No. No. Yes. No.

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:22.000
October 11th, we'll be live again at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, on All Games Radio.

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:24.000
www.AllGames.com

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:26.000
Any final thoughts tonight, DarkSakura?

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:29.000
I'm hungry.

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:32.000
I haven't talked about food all day.

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:35.000
That's how you know it's in a typical episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:42.000
My final thought is, by the time you're hearing this, I will be on Space Mountain Ghost Galaxy. Heart.

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:46.000
So, that's it. We're done. We're out of here.

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:50.000
Oh, let's go to San Francisco so we can wait for the tsunami.

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:53.000
The tsunami is not hitting the West Coast, didn't you hear?

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:59.000
Alright. We're out. Bye, guys. See you next week. October 11th, we'll be back live.

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:02.000
