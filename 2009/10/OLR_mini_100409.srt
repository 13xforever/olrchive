1
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:33,101
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that Simtoplus?

2
00:00:33,181 --> 00:00:34,242
[SPEAKER_05]: What is the deal over there?

3
00:00:34,442 --> 00:00:36,104
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you have naked Sims on your computer?

4
00:00:36,404 --> 00:00:37,365
[SPEAKER_01]: No, he's not naked.

5
00:00:37,385 --> 00:00:38,886
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, hi, we're live.

6
00:00:39,227 --> 00:00:40,147
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, we're live.

7
00:00:40,708 --> 00:00:41,409
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, we're not live.

8
00:00:41,469 --> 00:00:42,189
[SPEAKER_05]: We're taped tonight.

9
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:44,591
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a little special edition of Morison's Radio.

10
00:00:44,611 --> 00:00:46,413
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a voice from the past.

11
00:00:46,453 --> 00:00:47,054
[SPEAKER_05]: That's right.

12
00:00:47,174 --> 00:00:49,876
[SPEAKER_05]: Ooh, scary ghost of Christmas past.

13
00:00:50,276 --> 00:00:51,738
[SPEAKER_05]: No, we're pre-taping tonight.

14
00:00:52,458 --> 00:00:55,461
[SPEAKER_05]: Obviously, if you've been following OLR, we're out this week.

15
00:00:55,681 --> 00:00:55,781
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm...

16
00:00:57,083 --> 00:01:04,138
[SPEAKER_05]: As you guys are hearing this live on All Games Radio, I am far, far away in a strange, mystical land that they call La.

17
00:01:05,322 --> 00:01:08,525
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, Jamie Summers

18
00:01:28,911 --> 00:01:31,293
[SPEAKER_05]: Not here tonight is the one and only Techmaster Loki.

19
00:01:32,053 --> 00:01:38,017
[SPEAKER_05]: We're taping Not Live on a Tuesday night, and Loki just isn't here.

20
00:01:38,518 --> 00:01:41,820
[SPEAKER_05]: He didn't show up, and to be fair, I didn't call him.

21
00:01:42,741 --> 00:01:45,483
[SPEAKER_01]: I was going to say, shouldn't you have called?

22
00:01:46,083 --> 00:01:53,829
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, probably I should have, but here's the thing, is that then we'd have to wait 30 minutes for him to show up, and I'm just like, I want to get the hell out of here and get some dinner tonight.

23
00:01:54,929 --> 00:01:55,810
[SPEAKER_05]: He missed the boat.

24
00:01:56,531 --> 00:01:57,031
[SPEAKER_01]: I want dinner.

25
00:01:57,071 --> 00:01:58,432
[SPEAKER_05]: Should we call Matt and see where he's at?

26
00:01:59,557 --> 00:02:00,878
[SPEAKER_05]: How do you pre-tape?

27
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:17,781
[SPEAKER_05]: Silly little... That's what they call it.

28
00:02:17,801 --> 00:02:20,642
[SPEAKER_00]: That's industry speak for... Silly little prefixes.

29
00:02:20,802 --> 00:02:21,022
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

30
00:02:21,563 --> 00:02:25,024
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, I think we were going to do like a best of tonight or something.

31
00:02:25,385 --> 00:02:39,372
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we're going to roll that over until later because one of our listeners slash staff members, in other words, he listens so long we decided to just make him a staff member, Dark Tetsuya, is like putting something together out of some really old episodes.

32
00:02:40,512 --> 00:02:41,713
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course this wouldn't be...

33
00:02:42,304 --> 00:02:46,587
[SPEAKER_05]: It just wouldn't be OLR if the music I didn't intend to play started playing.

34
00:02:46,807 --> 00:02:47,267
[SPEAKER_04]: There we go.

35
00:02:50,549 --> 00:02:52,931
[SPEAKER_05]: How does that happen even when we're not live?

36
00:02:54,312 --> 00:02:56,193
[SPEAKER_05]: I had two songs queued up tonight.

37
00:02:56,553 --> 00:03:00,336
[SPEAKER_05]: The open and the Twitter topic song which we'll get into a little later.

38
00:03:01,197 --> 00:03:01,657
[SPEAKER_05]: I fail.

39
00:03:03,473 --> 00:03:03,833
[SPEAKER_05]: Simps3 and Peggle

40
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:27,160
[SPEAKER_01]: I never really got into it, you know.

41
00:03:50,393 --> 00:03:50,613
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

42
00:03:51,634 --> 00:03:52,074
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you think?

43
00:03:52,374 --> 00:03:54,014
[SPEAKER_05]: Why do you think you never were able to get into WoW?

44
00:03:54,034 --> 00:03:58,376
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, certainly there's plenty of our listeners who don't play Warcraft and there's some that do.

45
00:03:58,816 --> 00:04:01,397
[SPEAKER_05]: What is it that made you not really want to stick with it?

46
00:04:01,497 --> 00:04:05,459
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd hit around level seven and go, what the hell am I doing with my time?

47
00:04:07,597 --> 00:04:08,818
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess that's what I hear from a lot of people.

48
00:04:08,998 --> 00:04:14,241
[SPEAKER_01]: Because, you know, like when I was, I had a fun time playing with Tiara a while back.

49
00:04:14,662 --> 00:04:19,525
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's like, I'm not a get up and quest-o-rama type person and zip through them.

50
00:04:19,825 --> 00:04:23,728
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to explore a little bit and take it, you know, kind of slow.

51
00:04:23,868 --> 00:04:26,169
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was like, this is kind of boring.

52
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:27,690
[SPEAKER_01]: This is kind of boring.

53
00:04:27,730 --> 00:04:29,371
[SPEAKER_05]: It almost sounds like you're talking about something dirty.

54
00:04:29,591 --> 00:04:30,292
[SPEAKER_05]: It's kind of boring.

55
00:04:30,612 --> 00:04:35,155
[SPEAKER_05]: I like to take my time and explore a little bit slow.

56
00:04:35,595 --> 00:04:36,316
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's kind of boring.

57
00:04:36,336 --> 00:04:36,416
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

58
00:04:39,324 --> 00:04:41,906
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I have a good time if I'm playing with people.

59
00:04:44,008 --> 00:04:44,789
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, shut up.

60
00:04:47,070 --> 00:04:49,112
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you talking about WoW or what?

61
00:04:49,132 --> 00:04:55,357
[SPEAKER_01]: In regards to World of Warcraft, I have a better time playing with a friend when I've got something to... Shut up.

62
00:05:02,123 --> 00:05:02,423
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

63
00:05:03,544 --> 00:05:07,227
[SPEAKER_01]: But what I was saying is it's more fun when I have other people to participate in the game with.

64
00:05:07,768 --> 00:05:08,088
[SPEAKER_05]: I see.

65
00:05:09,226 --> 00:05:09,646
[SPEAKER_05]: Fair enough.

66
00:05:11,608 --> 00:05:14,571
[SPEAKER_05]: Of all the things in this room, you threw a box of Kleenex at me.

67
00:05:14,751 --> 00:05:15,011
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.

68
00:05:15,492 --> 00:05:15,772
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

69
00:05:15,912 --> 00:05:17,534
[SPEAKER_05]: You almost hit Shermie.

70
00:05:17,674 --> 00:05:19,376
[SPEAKER_01]: I figured if it landed on Shermie, it wouldn't hurt her.

71
00:05:19,636 --> 00:05:19,856
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

72
00:05:20,457 --> 00:05:22,058
[SPEAKER_01]: You notice who did not budge?

73
00:05:22,819 --> 00:05:23,479
[SPEAKER_05]: Shermie, yeah.

74
00:05:23,499 --> 00:05:28,664
[SPEAKER_05]: She just parks her fat ass there next to the very warm computer for pretty much the night.

75
00:05:28,684 --> 00:05:30,986
[SPEAKER_01]: That's her little fortress of solitude.

76
00:05:31,007 --> 00:05:31,347
[SPEAKER_01]: Mm-hmm.

77
00:05:32,148 --> 00:05:36,489
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, well on tonight's show, oh, I actually did play one new game I want to talk about.

78
00:05:36,849 --> 00:05:37,809
[SPEAKER_05]: So we'll give them something new.

79
00:05:38,169 --> 00:05:40,030
[SPEAKER_05]: I played Luminous for the iPhone.

80
00:05:40,790 --> 00:05:41,830
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you say Bluminous?

81
00:05:41,910 --> 00:05:42,690
[SPEAKER_05]: No, Luminous.

82
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:45,391
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought so, but... Or Lumines, as some people call it.

83
00:05:45,591 --> 00:05:46,351
[SPEAKER_01]: Luminous!

84
00:05:46,571 --> 00:05:47,031
[SPEAKER_05]: Luminous.

85
00:05:48,252 --> 00:05:53,633
[SPEAKER_05]: This is the puzzle game that, of course, was hugely, disgustingly popular on the PSP, and rightfully so.

86
00:05:54,073 --> 00:05:58,894
[SPEAKER_05]: And then had a sequel come out on the PSP that I don't think was quite as well received, even though it had Hollaback Girl.

87
00:05:59,854 --> 00:06:03,495
[SPEAKER_05]: and then it had versions on the PlayStation Network as well as Xbox Live.

88
00:06:03,735 --> 00:06:13,239
[SPEAKER_05]: The Xbox Live version, of course, was highly criticized for being kind of the first microtransaction-y game where there was just lots and lots of little things to download and add to the game.

89
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:15,720
[SPEAKER_05]: Now it's out on iPhone.

90
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:18,340
[SPEAKER_05]: I love Luminous.

91
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:37,026
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, Luminous is one of my favorite puzzle games ever because, you know, I love music games and I love the whole infusion and all that, kind of like how the music plays a part in the puzzle game where, you know, if you've never played Luminous before, basically you're trying to make blocks of varying size out of four by four blocks of different colors.

92
00:06:37,606 --> 00:06:41,087
[SPEAKER_05]: But the bar that sweeps across the field moves in time to the music.

93
00:06:41,427 --> 00:06:45,008
[SPEAKER_05]: And as you move the blocks around, the beats that it makes kind of fit in with the music.

94
00:06:45,489 --> 00:06:46,509
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it worth the purchase to you?

95
00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:48,070
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, here's the thing.

96
00:06:48,431 --> 00:06:50,573
[SPEAKER_05]: On the iPhone, it sucks.

97
00:06:51,174 --> 00:06:51,895
[SPEAKER_05]: It sucks.

98
00:06:52,336 --> 00:06:52,996
[SPEAKER_05]: It sucks.

99
00:06:53,497 --> 00:06:54,138
[SPEAKER_05]: I hate it.

100
00:06:54,598 --> 00:06:55,800
[SPEAKER_05]: It is awful.

101
00:06:56,941 --> 00:07:04,410
[SPEAKER_05]: The version of Luminous that I played on my old Sprint cell phone that had a four directional key and stuff was more fun to play.

102
00:07:04,710 --> 00:07:05,611
[SPEAKER_05]: And let me tell you why.

103
00:07:06,212 --> 00:07:07,493
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

104
00:07:21,926 --> 00:07:40,573
[SPEAKER_05]: and the reason why is that they made one key design flaw and that flaw is that in order to move the bricks you touch the screen and you move your finger left or you move your finger right but to drop it you move your finger down so what do you think happens when I'm playing keep dropping it exactly

105
00:07:41,732 --> 00:07:42,753
[SPEAKER_05]: Pebble is so beautiful on iPhones.

106
00:08:01,032 --> 00:08:01,913
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

107
00:08:21,474 --> 00:08:28,777
[SPEAKER_05]: So, if you are a fan of Luminous, avoid, avoid, avoid until they get this control scheme fixed.

108
00:08:29,117 --> 00:08:44,042
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I don't care if they put this shitty touch control thing in as an option, but what they need to do is have it so you can turn drops off, or that there's a specific little button in the right-hand corner or something where my thumb could rest that would drop the thing.

109
00:08:44,342 --> 00:08:46,503
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's the only way you would drop it.

110
00:08:46,603 --> 00:08:48,904
[SPEAKER_05]: That would make it so much better.

111
00:08:49,423 --> 00:08:56,247
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura has been browsing the MMO world and has found quite a bit going on apparently in the land of MMOs.

112
00:09:13,873 --> 00:09:32,940
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, for the people looking forward to Star Trek Online, namely me, if you get the Season 3 Blu-ray that's going to be coming out, then you will be actually receiving an Admiral's outfit.

113
00:09:35,342 --> 00:09:39,365
[SPEAKER_05]: I really think they're trying to push the game, especially with using champions to do it and all that.

114
00:09:39,485 --> 00:09:39,886
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah...

115
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:09,650
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks like they're really trying to get the fans of the series into the MMO even if they're not necessarily gamers.

116
00:10:10,552 --> 00:10:19,136
[SPEAKER_05]: Which is smart, but the problem is, as weird as it sounds, I am kind of a bit of a Trekkie, but I don't really have an interest in those Blu-rays.

117
00:10:20,897 --> 00:10:22,218
[SPEAKER_05]: The original series Blu-rays, right?

118
00:10:22,238 --> 00:10:24,779
[SPEAKER_05]: Because, like, original series season three?

119
00:10:25,339 --> 00:10:27,320
[SPEAKER_05]: Although, wait, no, there was no third season.

120
00:10:27,401 --> 00:10:28,441
[SPEAKER_05]: Was there a third season?

121
00:10:29,141 --> 00:10:31,282
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought there were only two, but whatever.

122
00:10:31,302 --> 00:10:36,045
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure there were, yeah, because third season is when you really started noticing the toupee.

123
00:10:36,576 --> 00:10:41,358
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not really into the original series anyway, as much of a Trekkie as I am.

124
00:10:41,758 --> 00:10:49,702
[SPEAKER_05]: It was all about, yeah, I mean, I get that, but it was all about the, it was all about Next Generation and Voyager and Deep Space Nine.

125
00:10:49,762 --> 00:10:50,582
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all about DS9.

126
00:10:50,702 --> 00:10:51,302
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

127
00:10:51,822 --> 00:10:54,804
[SPEAKER_05]: So I guess that's kind of cool, though.

128
00:10:54,984 --> 00:11:02,847
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, a little bonus perk tie-in, but sorry, I'm not going to spend like $80 on a Blu-ray box set season just to get some one little dumb little item.

129
00:11:03,227 --> 00:11:04,908
[SPEAKER_05]: Hopefully it'll be unlockable some other ways.

130
00:11:05,333 --> 00:11:05,634
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe.

131
00:11:06,295 --> 00:11:10,220
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, then again, it's like the admirals, all they do is sit in a chair and be important.

132
00:11:11,102 --> 00:11:17,752
[SPEAKER_01]: The captain's seat is what everyone joins Starfleet for, you know, to sort of paraphrase a DS9 episode.

133
00:11:19,405 --> 00:11:21,807
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm still very, very curious about Star Trek Online.

134
00:11:22,047 --> 00:11:28,352
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm a little jealous of those that went to PAX and got to get a little sneak peek of it because I definitely am curious where this game is headed.

135
00:11:28,633 --> 00:11:30,354
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a lot of great MMOs on the horizon.

136
00:11:30,374 --> 00:11:32,896
[SPEAKER_05]: Final Fantasy XIV, I'm sorry.

137
00:11:33,436 --> 00:11:36,319
[SPEAKER_05]: Hate on XI all you want, but XIV looks amazing.

138
00:11:36,339 --> 00:11:38,160
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm really interested in where this game goes.

139
00:11:38,521 --> 00:11:42,964
[SPEAKER_05]: Granted, by the time I play it, a lot could change, but the trailer looked pretty cool.

140
00:11:44,425 --> 00:11:46,447
[SPEAKER_05]: Even WoW's next expansion looks really good.

141
00:11:47,268 --> 00:11:50,974
[SPEAKER_01]: There's also some news about Final Fantasy XI since you brought it up.

142
00:11:51,014 --> 00:11:52,356
[SPEAKER_05]: People are still playing Final Fantasy XI?

143
00:11:52,456 --> 00:11:52,716
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

144
00:11:52,877 --> 00:11:54,038
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.

145
00:11:54,138 --> 00:12:02,771
[SPEAKER_01]: In October, there's going to be a new expansion titled Shantotto Ascension that's supposed to...

146
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:11,922
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, actually they say that the next free version update is going to be in November.

147
00:12:12,202 --> 00:12:16,583
[SPEAKER_01]: But other than that, we're looking for October for the expansion pack.

148
00:12:17,763 --> 00:12:35,188
[SPEAKER_01]: It will have the new Wings of the Goddess Nation quests, the Moblin Maze Monger's dungeon crawling system, and it's also the final part in a series of stories that was written by the guy who wrote the story for Chrono Trigger.

149
00:12:36,429 --> 00:12:37,390
[SPEAKER_01]: Masato Kato.

150
00:12:38,711 --> 00:12:41,554
[SPEAKER_05]: So that is going to stick out for a lot of people.

151
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:44,877
[SPEAKER_05]: If it was written by the guy who did Chrono Trigger, there's going to be fanboys that are like, huh?

152
00:12:44,977 --> 00:12:45,157
[SPEAKER_05]: What?

153
00:12:45,998 --> 00:12:51,103
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the trilogy of the stories, I'm trying to pull up that information.

154
00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:56,629
[SPEAKER_01]: But seriously, I don't think that

155
00:12:59,008 --> 00:12:59,909
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

156
00:13:14,049 --> 00:13:15,390
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I remember hearing about these.

157
00:13:15,410 --> 00:13:21,295
[SPEAKER_05]: These were the very small mini expansions they released that are like online only that you would get for the game.

158
00:13:21,535 --> 00:13:24,417
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess they pretty much stopped with the in-store ones, which makes sense.

159
00:13:24,457 --> 00:13:30,282
[SPEAKER_05]: If they have 14 on the horizon, development for 11 is probably going to slow up significantly and remain things like this.

160
00:13:30,702 --> 00:13:31,362
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I agree.

161
00:13:31,743 --> 00:13:32,543
[SPEAKER_05]: Which is very interesting.

162
00:13:32,603 --> 00:13:36,987
[SPEAKER_05]: What happens to a game like Final Fantasy 11 when Final Fantasy 14 comes out?

163
00:13:37,207 --> 00:13:39,309
[SPEAKER_01]: It's probably going to go the way of PSO.

164
00:13:40,202 --> 00:13:45,543
[SPEAKER_05]: But you look at EverQuest and EverQuest 2, I think there's more people still playing the original EverQuest.

165
00:13:45,563 --> 00:13:46,944
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to be interesting.

166
00:13:47,004 --> 00:13:48,684
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think that doesn't always happen, though.

167
00:13:49,785 --> 00:13:54,226
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, then again, there are still a bunch of people playing Diablo 2.

168
00:13:54,566 --> 00:13:56,767
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, we haven't had a lot of MMOs get sequels yet.

169
00:13:56,907 --> 00:13:57,327
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what I mean?

170
00:13:57,367 --> 00:13:57,607
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

171
00:13:58,127 --> 00:13:59,907
[SPEAKER_05]: And Diablo 3 is still not out.

172
00:14:00,307 --> 00:14:06,069
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the Ragnarok one was still going on, and a lot of people were still preferring the 2D over the 3D.

173
00:14:06,309 --> 00:14:06,849
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, that's right.

174
00:14:06,889 --> 00:14:08,290
[SPEAKER_05]: I totally forgot about Ragnarok 2.

175
00:14:08,930 --> 00:14:09,210
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

176
00:14:09,370 --> 00:14:09,510
[SPEAKER_05]: Hmm.

177
00:14:10,711 --> 00:14:13,513
[SPEAKER_05]: I wonder if that... So that finally came out at some point?

178
00:14:13,873 --> 00:14:14,313
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

179
00:14:14,393 --> 00:14:15,894
[SPEAKER_01]: I stopped paying attention to it, honestly.

180
00:14:16,935 --> 00:14:17,155
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice.

181
00:14:18,095 --> 00:14:20,617
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't touched Ragnarok in like a month, so... A whole month?

182
00:14:23,498 --> 00:14:24,739
[SPEAKER_01]: I couldn't really get back into it.

183
00:14:24,779 --> 00:14:29,602
[SPEAKER_01]: I sort of was going through the same thing that I went through, you know, with World... Like, what am I doing with my time?

184
00:14:31,022 --> 00:14:33,304
[SPEAKER_05]: Well... So you went back to Sims instead.

185
00:14:35,865 --> 00:14:37,966
[SPEAKER_01]: This is actually the first time I've opened Sims in two weeks.

186
00:14:38,026 --> 00:14:38,947
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just giving you a hard time.

187
00:14:39,238 --> 00:14:41,919
[SPEAKER_01]: Except to remodel a character.

188
00:14:42,299 --> 00:14:44,080
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's something about a game that you like, Rob.

189
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:44,720
[SPEAKER_05]: What's that?

190
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:45,621
[SPEAKER_01]: Aion.

191
00:14:45,641 --> 00:14:47,681
[SPEAKER_05]: Aion, you know what's funny?

192
00:14:47,721 --> 00:14:51,203
[SPEAKER_05]: I never did end up buying the full game because I heard about all the problems they were having.

193
00:14:51,643 --> 00:14:54,844
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, I don't need to be the very first person in an MMO.

194
00:14:55,064 --> 00:14:58,086
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to give Aion a few months to let the dust settle.

195
00:14:58,646 --> 00:14:59,906
[SPEAKER_05]: Because it's been having a lot of issues.

196
00:15:00,106 --> 00:15:03,328
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, this is actually more news for our European listeners anyway.

197
00:15:04,929 --> 00:15:06,770
[SPEAKER_01]: They are opening two European servers.

198
00:15:06,970 --> 00:15:12,693
[SPEAKER_01]: One is a French language server called Deltris and an English server called Karun.

199
00:15:14,654 --> 00:15:22,218
[SPEAKER_01]: It's supposed to be available for character transfers from the different servers in a couple of months.

200
00:15:22,258 --> 00:15:23,579
[SPEAKER_01]: They haven't said exactly.

201
00:15:27,201 --> 00:15:28,742
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's on its way.

202
00:15:31,504 --> 00:15:33,385
[SPEAKER_01]: They say that everything should...

203
00:15:33,956 --> 00:15:34,016
[SPEAKER_05]: Hmm.

204
00:15:59,147 --> 00:16:04,170
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, well, I've got some other news for you guys that doesn't have to do with MMOs.

205
00:16:04,190 --> 00:16:06,552
[SPEAKER_05]: There's actually been a few things that have happened over the past couple days.

206
00:16:07,553 --> 00:16:08,934
[SPEAKER_05]: The Wii got a system update.

207
00:16:09,394 --> 00:16:14,998
[SPEAKER_05]: It has a brand new 4.2 release software, and you might be asking, oh, what cool new feature do I get with this?

208
00:16:15,378 --> 00:16:16,899
[SPEAKER_05]: And the answer is nothing.

209
00:16:17,419 --> 00:16:20,261
[SPEAKER_05]: At least there's nothing that they're touting that is big about this release.

210
00:16:20,621 --> 00:16:26,686
[SPEAKER_05]: Apparently, the Wii system update 4.2 really only did some things behind the scenes, and it's also supposed to improve...

211
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:28,140
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura.com

212
00:16:55,247 --> 00:17:21,880
[SPEAKER_05]: also big big and confirmed this week there were some rumors about this and we talked about it on the show but Super Street Fighter 4 was confirmed earlier this week it apparently was revealed by GameSpot has released the first details on the game T-Hawk and DJ are coming back in the game and there's also going to be a brand new female character named Juri that is coming back to Street Fighter 4 Super Street Fighter 4 is it spelled J-U-R-I?

213
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:22,140
[SPEAKER_05]: yeah

214
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:27,345
[SPEAKER_01]: It could also be one of the alpha characters.

215
00:17:28,427 --> 00:17:30,952
[SPEAKER_01]: Remember Judy and Junie?

216
00:17:31,343 --> 00:17:33,244
[SPEAKER_05]: Super Street Fighter 4 Super Street Fighter 4

217
00:17:53,112 --> 00:17:55,092
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, so let's see here.

218
00:17:55,112 --> 00:17:57,653
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a little back and forth going on there.

219
00:17:57,713 --> 00:18:00,634
[SPEAKER_01]: I love the graphic style in this.

220
00:18:00,734 --> 00:18:04,214
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so gorgeous.

221
00:18:04,434 --> 00:18:07,315
[SPEAKER_01]: Nah, it doesn't look like that.

222
00:18:07,355 --> 00:18:09,976
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it looks like just another Ken vs. Ryu little epic battle.

223
00:18:10,016 --> 00:18:13,896
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if it's really going to show any new people.

224
00:18:14,537 --> 00:18:18,177
[SPEAKER_05]: Boy, what if this is what the fighting actually looked like in the game?

225
00:18:20,038 --> 00:18:20,798
[SPEAKER_05]: That'd be awesome.

226
00:18:21,791 --> 00:18:24,516
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the same freaking font and everything.

227
00:18:24,756 --> 00:18:25,337
[SPEAKER_05]: For Super?

228
00:18:25,597 --> 00:18:25,878
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

229
00:18:25,938 --> 00:18:26,159
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

230
00:18:26,179 --> 00:18:27,080
[SPEAKER_05]: It's kind of cool.

231
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:28,543
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course you know I'd notice the font.

232
00:18:28,803 --> 00:18:29,084
[SPEAKER_05]: I know.

233
00:18:29,425 --> 00:18:29,825
[SPEAKER_05]: You nerd.

234
00:18:30,146 --> 00:18:31,068
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, there's going to be...

235
00:18:32,911 --> 00:18:35,593
[SPEAKER_05]: 8 new characters, 3 of them probably familiar.

236
00:18:59,116 --> 00:19:02,617
[SPEAKER_05]: Apparently though, Capcom will not charge full price for the title.

237
00:19:02,978 --> 00:19:03,958
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not sure what that means.

238
00:19:04,138 --> 00:19:09,260
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm assuming that means it's probably going to be in the realm of $40 for this as opposed to a full $60 game.

239
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:14,342
[SPEAKER_01]: Another thing to consider, did they say that it was going to be hard copy or did they say it's going to be a download?

240
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:17,561
[SPEAKER_05]: I believe this is an all-new release that's coming out.

241
00:19:17,621 --> 00:19:19,541
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not some type of download expansion.

242
00:19:19,561 --> 00:19:21,222
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we'll get some answers to that in the next few days.

243
00:19:21,522 --> 00:19:24,783
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's certainly, I think it would be too big for a download, I think.

244
00:19:25,743 --> 00:19:28,344
[SPEAKER_05]: Eight new characters and all this character balancing, that's big.

245
00:19:28,364 --> 00:19:33,386
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm pretty sure it's going to be... Does this mean that they're going to make Seth less of an ass?

246
00:19:33,906 --> 00:19:34,346
[SPEAKER_05]: Hopefully.

247
00:19:36,107 --> 00:19:39,908
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, even the guys that made the game said he's way too powerful.

248
00:19:40,305 --> 00:19:42,387
[SPEAKER_05]: I remember that coming up on a previous episode of the show.

249
00:19:42,407 --> 00:19:43,849
[SPEAKER_05]: It was funny.

250
00:19:44,490 --> 00:19:44,810
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

251
00:19:45,371 --> 00:19:47,793
[SPEAKER_05]: One other story I've got for you guys about Squeenix.

252
00:19:48,074 --> 00:19:53,319
[SPEAKER_05]: And Squeenix apparently earlier this week, of course, that's my lovely name for Square Enix, which now is Square Enix Eidos.

253
00:19:54,421 --> 00:19:55,222
[SPEAKER_05]: All that stuff in there.

254
00:19:55,442 --> 00:19:57,965
[SPEAKER_01]: So would they be Squino... Squino-dos.

255
00:19:58,365 --> 00:19:58,906
[SPEAKER_01]: Squindos.

256
00:19:59,912 --> 00:20:01,893
[SPEAKER_05]: Dragon Quest, Kingdom Hearts, Final Fantasy 8 flagship IPs

257
00:20:23,988 --> 00:20:32,971
[SPEAKER_05]: If each one of these games has a two year development cycle for a new game in the franchise, then that means every quarter they could release a two million selling game.

258
00:20:33,712 --> 00:20:37,973
[SPEAKER_05]: And you could certainly see that happening with series like Final Fantasy, Dragon Quest, Kingdom Hearts.

259
00:20:38,233 --> 00:20:40,494
[SPEAKER_05]: But the question is, where the hell are the other games going to come from?

260
00:20:41,514 --> 00:20:42,115
[SPEAKER_00]: Star Ocean?

261
00:20:43,135 --> 00:20:45,356
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that a two million selling title every time?

262
00:20:45,556 --> 00:20:48,297
[SPEAKER_01]: The Tales games?

263
00:20:48,942 --> 00:20:49,883
[SPEAKER_05]: Batman and Kingdom Hearts!

264
00:21:10,168 --> 00:21:12,729
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if that's possible, but that would be interesting.

265
00:21:12,749 --> 00:21:13,429
[SPEAKER_01]: Shut up, Sora.

266
00:21:13,509 --> 00:21:14,149
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm Batman.

267
00:21:16,050 --> 00:21:16,430
[SPEAKER_00]: What?

268
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:17,250
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm Batman.

269
00:21:17,550 --> 00:21:19,171
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you one of the heartless... I'm Batman.

270
00:21:21,292 --> 00:21:21,912
[SPEAKER_00]: Batman!

271
00:21:22,892 --> 00:21:24,573
[SPEAKER_05]: You almost... You know what you remind me of there?

272
00:21:24,653 --> 00:21:27,593
[SPEAKER_05]: It's Eddie Murphy from 80s Saturday Night Live.

273
00:21:28,274 --> 00:21:28,914
[SPEAKER_05]: My name is Gumby.

274
00:21:29,314 --> 00:21:30,014
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm Gumby, damn it.

275
00:21:30,734 --> 00:21:31,635
Remember that?

276
00:21:31,675 --> 00:21:32,475
[SPEAKER_01]: That's old school.

277
00:21:32,555 --> 00:21:33,475
[SPEAKER_05]: That's very old school.

278
00:21:33,495 --> 00:21:34,936
[SPEAKER_05]: That's older than most of our listeners.

279
00:21:35,216 --> 00:21:36,016
[SPEAKER_01]: That's older than most schools.

280
00:21:36,036 --> 00:21:36,456
[SPEAKER_01]: That joke right there.

281
00:21:37,016 --> 00:21:37,497
[SPEAKER_05]: That's right.

282
00:21:38,017 --> 00:21:38,217
[SPEAKER_05]: So...

283
00:21:39,485 --> 00:21:41,626
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, well Jamie wants to tell you guys about one other thing.

284
00:21:42,406 --> 00:21:45,548
[SPEAKER_01]: This is actually in regards to Left 4 Dead.

285
00:21:46,168 --> 00:21:49,870
[SPEAKER_01]: The Crash Course is actually out on Steam and Xbox Live Marketplace.

286
00:21:50,891 --> 00:21:53,532
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's actually a price point on it.

287
00:21:55,753 --> 00:22:00,435
[SPEAKER_01]: It actually was released at a higher price point, but ended up being an error.

288
00:22:01,156 --> 00:22:05,038
[SPEAKER_01]: It is actually going to be out for, well is out I should say, for 560 Microsoft points.

289
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:12,463
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now, but it is, like I said, an error.

290
00:22:13,044 --> 00:22:16,647
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you think it's worth the money to spend a little bit more on it, go for it.

291
00:22:16,727 --> 00:22:20,010
[SPEAKER_01]: But just keep in mind, it is going to be dropped.

292
00:22:21,151 --> 00:22:28,557
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, if you have it on PC, then the Crash Course actually isn't really available from Steam yet.

293
00:22:29,939 --> 00:22:34,763
[SPEAKER_01]: It's supposed to bridge the gap between the Death Toll and No Mercy game.

294
00:22:35,131 --> 00:22:38,033
[SPEAKER_05]: That is very strange that it wouldn't even be on Valve's own service yet.

295
00:22:39,133 --> 00:22:39,554
[SPEAKER_05]: On Steam.

296
00:22:39,854 --> 00:22:40,014
[SPEAKER_05]: Huh.

297
00:22:41,094 --> 00:22:42,055
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure it's just a little holdup.

298
00:22:42,075 --> 00:22:43,936
[SPEAKER_01]: It just says that the download content is not available yet.

299
00:22:45,177 --> 00:22:45,417
[SPEAKER_05]: Soon.

300
00:22:46,097 --> 00:22:46,297
[SPEAKER_05]: Soon.

301
00:22:46,557 --> 00:22:46,818
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe.

302
00:22:47,318 --> 00:22:52,461
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, well, we're going to get into a little segment we do here on Orange Launch Radio called Twitter Topics because...

303
00:22:53,547 --> 00:23:05,915
[SPEAKER_05]: because we can because we can basically that's what it boils down to we're bored and don't really know what else to talk about here on the show tonight because it's only been a couple days since our last show we go to twitter and we say hey guys what do you guys want us to talk about tonight because you know it's where every gamer has a voice and

304
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:08,721
[SPEAKER_05]: Sadly, we can't do calls tonight because we're not actually live.

305
00:23:08,741 --> 00:23:13,983
[SPEAKER_05]: There's another show going on on All Games right now, so we couldn't, you know, we don't have our own radio station anymore.

306
00:23:14,003 --> 00:23:16,384
[SPEAKER_05]: We can't just bust down the door and say, hey, guys, we're live.

307
00:23:16,544 --> 00:23:19,745
[SPEAKER_00]: We could just go, hey, chat room, someone call us.

308
00:23:20,545 --> 00:23:26,847
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess we could go bust down the door on All Games, but I don't think the VGO fans would appreciate that.

309
00:23:26,887 --> 00:23:28,828
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no, no, they can call our line.

310
00:23:29,969 --> 00:23:31,091
[SPEAKER_05]: We only have a couple people in chat right now.

311
00:23:31,111 --> 00:23:32,793
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I've been soliciting questions from chat.

312
00:23:33,013 --> 00:23:34,916
[SPEAKER_05]: So we got plenty and plenty of questions.

313
00:23:34,976 --> 00:23:36,418
[SPEAKER_01]: By all means, Mr. Rob Kerski.

314
00:23:36,838 --> 00:23:38,841
[SPEAKER_05]: Tweets and chatters and all this stuff.

315
00:23:40,363 --> 00:23:42,305
[SPEAKER_05]: Blue Swim is our first tweeter tonight.

316
00:23:42,345 --> 00:23:44,028
[SPEAKER_05]: We got a lot of tweet questions.

317
00:23:44,148 --> 00:23:44,628
[SPEAKER_05]: We got more.

318
00:23:44,889 --> 00:23:46,851
[SPEAKER_05]: We got like twice as many as we usually do on a Sunday.

319
00:23:52,616 --> 00:23:57,861
[SPEAKER_05]: Blue Swim on the Twitter asks, What do you guys think of the natural disaster survival genre?

320
00:23:58,261 --> 00:24:02,885
[SPEAKER_05]: Twister the game with a flying cow and digital Helen Hunt tits equals epic win.

321
00:24:05,087 --> 00:24:05,828
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what though?

322
00:24:07,012 --> 00:24:11,374
[SPEAKER_05]: If Loki were here, he would diss that game that Konami was showing at E3, which was something like that.

323
00:24:11,394 --> 00:24:12,575
[SPEAKER_05]: It was like a natural disaster game.

324
00:24:12,855 --> 00:24:18,638
[SPEAKER_05]: And there was one of those on Xbox Live not that long ago, too, and neither one of those games was exactly as awesome as you would think.

325
00:24:18,778 --> 00:24:21,380
[SPEAKER_05]: And neither one had digital Helen Hunt tits, either.

326
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:33,946
[SPEAKER_01]: The closest I've ever played that had natural disasters in it that I could stand was the tornado area in Sonic the Hedgehog on Dreamcast, because that was pretty freaking cool.

327
00:24:34,506 --> 00:24:35,547
[SPEAKER_01]: Other than that, SUCK!

328
00:24:36,975 --> 00:24:45,540
[SPEAKER_05]: BlueSwim goes on to say in a second tweet, After playing the PlayStation 2 game Raw Danger, I'm convinced that the disaster genre has huge amounts of untapped potential.

329
00:24:46,020 --> 00:24:46,680
[SPEAKER_05]: I have to be honest.

330
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:47,881
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't leave that untapped, please.

331
00:24:47,901 --> 00:24:50,002
[SPEAKER_05]: That's not a game I've ever played.

332
00:24:50,062 --> 00:24:50,903
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that something newer?

333
00:24:52,043 --> 00:24:52,824
[SPEAKER_05]: This is PlayStation 2.

334
00:24:54,505 --> 00:24:55,265
[SPEAKER_01]: I have no idea.

335
00:24:56,066 --> 00:25:01,108
[SPEAKER_05]: GamerGirl on the Twitter asks, What was the first game anyone's ever played?

336
00:25:01,689 --> 00:25:02,649
[SPEAKER_05]: Ooh, that's tough.

337
00:25:03,170 --> 00:25:04,450
[SPEAKER_05]: I gotta go way back.

338
00:25:05,211 --> 00:25:05,271
[SPEAKER_05]: Um...

339
00:25:06,377 --> 00:25:07,177
[SPEAKER_05]: There's two.

340
00:25:07,618 --> 00:25:11,560
[SPEAKER_05]: My earliest memories, because I don't remember, unfortunately, far enough back.

341
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:13,981
[SPEAKER_05]: It's hard, because when you're that young, you don't remember everything.

342
00:25:14,482 --> 00:25:16,943
[SPEAKER_05]: But I would say I kind of have a memory of two games.

343
00:25:17,964 --> 00:25:20,525
[SPEAKER_05]: One of them would be Spider-Man on the Atari 2600.

344
00:25:20,625 --> 00:25:23,427
[SPEAKER_05]: It was one of the first games I ever remember playing.

345
00:25:24,687 --> 00:25:26,628
[SPEAKER_05]: And at the arcade, Crystal Castles.

346
00:25:27,429 --> 00:25:30,971
[SPEAKER_05]: I remember going to my sister's wedding reception once.

347
00:25:32,136 --> 00:25:34,317
[SPEAKER_05]: I remember being four and playing Pong on an arcade machine

348
00:25:59,755 --> 00:26:01,757
[SPEAKER_01]: I grew up playing pinball, really.

349
00:26:03,658 --> 00:26:17,849
[SPEAKER_01]: As far as early memories, I remember being six and going to play the Odyssey 2 at my friend's house next door and playing Casey Munchkin and Casey Crazy Chase.

350
00:26:18,729 --> 00:26:24,113
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a ColecoVision when I was a kid.

351
00:26:27,276 --> 00:26:27,417
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh...

352
00:26:37,571 --> 00:26:39,413
[SPEAKER_05]: Who enabled your gaming addiction?

353
00:26:39,453 --> 00:26:46,358
[SPEAKER_05]: Because it doesn't sound like your mom was really that much into video games, but yet you had all these systems that I never heard of.

354
00:26:46,398 --> 00:26:49,601
[SPEAKER_01]: My mom actually was kind of into games.

355
00:26:50,142 --> 00:26:55,626
[SPEAKER_01]: Because keep in mind, when I was four, my mom was still in her early 20s.

356
00:26:56,767 --> 00:26:58,969
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of my childhood was spent with my mom in her 20s.

357
00:27:00,490 --> 00:27:04,251
[SPEAKER_01]: And so she liked to go out and have fun and liked games and played some pinball.

358
00:27:04,392 --> 00:27:13,875
[SPEAKER_01]: And when we'd go get pizza, she'd give me a few quarters and leave me in the little game area so I could play the Mario one or play Kangaroo.

359
00:27:14,275 --> 00:27:16,956
[SPEAKER_01]: Kangaroo was... I was the shit at Kangaroo.

360
00:27:18,917 --> 00:27:22,498
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, over at Godfather's Pizza back in the day in Mobile.

361
00:27:22,898 --> 00:27:23,238
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.

362
00:27:23,999 --> 00:27:24,099
[SPEAKER_01]: And...

363
00:27:25,336 --> 00:27:31,688
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been a gamer practically since I knew that turn this knob, the bar moves this way.

364
00:27:34,156 --> 00:27:37,159
[SPEAKER_05]: I have very early memories of Atari 2600 in much the same way.

365
00:27:37,199 --> 00:27:42,943
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't remember who got one for the family or how we got it, but we had an Atari 2600, and my dad hooked it up.

366
00:27:43,884 --> 00:27:55,734
[SPEAKER_05]: But it was hooked up in my mom's room, which I always thought was weird, but I think that was so that if my dad wanted to watch TV or somebody wanted to watch a real show, then I wouldn't be monopolizing the big television with video games.

367
00:27:55,874 --> 00:28:00,218
[SPEAKER_05]: So I would always have to go in my mom's room to play, and then she'd get mad if I don't ask first.

368
00:28:00,999 --> 00:28:04,463
[SPEAKER_01]: I also played a lot of Apple II games.

369
00:28:04,643 --> 00:28:08,027
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of Kix, Lode Runner.

370
00:28:08,367 --> 00:28:13,553
[SPEAKER_01]: I also grew up on the Carmen Sandiego games.

371
00:28:13,693 --> 00:28:14,855
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, I played those too.

372
00:28:14,875 --> 00:28:16,056
[SPEAKER_05]: Oregon Trail.

373
00:28:16,897 --> 00:28:17,257
[SPEAKER_05]: Mousetrap

374
00:28:46,918 --> 00:28:58,184
[SPEAKER_01]: and, you know, her stupid ex-husband, Craphead, playing... He was really good at Carnival.

375
00:28:59,246 --> 00:28:59,686
[SPEAKER_05]: GORF GORF GORF

376
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:21,821
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

377
00:29:41,198 --> 00:29:46,043
[SPEAKER_05]: I would love to hook up the old ass systems and see how long some of those games can hold our attention today.

378
00:29:46,384 --> 00:29:49,567
[SPEAKER_01]: There's the point of actually having a TV that will run some of them.

379
00:29:49,627 --> 00:29:52,530
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep in mind, my Odyssey 2, we don't have a TV it works on.

380
00:29:53,732 --> 00:29:55,974
[SPEAKER_05]: They take the old coaxial cable thing, right?

381
00:29:56,014 --> 00:29:58,537
[SPEAKER_05]: The little hooky things.

382
00:29:58,917 --> 00:30:00,219
[SPEAKER_05]: They go with the coaxial cable, right?

383
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:02,241
[SPEAKER_05]: Like hooking up cable.

384
00:30:05,373 --> 00:30:05,813
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

385
00:30:24,164 --> 00:30:26,265
[SPEAKER_01]: My Nintendo had one of those.

386
00:30:26,365 --> 00:30:32,150
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, those TVs are going to actually be really easy to find now because a lot of them, because of the whole digital TV transition, they're obsolete.

387
00:30:32,650 --> 00:30:35,292
[SPEAKER_05]: So what else are they good for but playing video games?

388
00:30:35,492 --> 00:30:36,193
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, seriously.

389
00:30:36,873 --> 00:30:38,274
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyhow, let's move on with some other questions.

390
00:30:38,294 --> 00:30:38,695
[SPEAKER_05]: That was a lot.

391
00:30:39,135 --> 00:30:41,677
[SPEAKER_05]: Takeo Ray wanted to plug his Extra Life donation page.

392
00:30:42,017 --> 00:30:43,458
[SPEAKER_05]: The URL is very long.

393
00:30:43,518 --> 00:30:47,181
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll go ahead and read it here because obviously Extra Life was something we wanted to be involved with.

394
00:30:47,221 --> 00:30:47,942
[SPEAKER_05]: Unfortunately, we had to

395
00:30:48,402 --> 00:30:52,303
[SPEAKER_05]: Backout is shared on the last show, which sucks, but we are still supporting the cause, certainly.

396
00:30:52,643 --> 00:31:02,545
[SPEAKER_05]: TKL Ray's page is at ways2give.texaschildrens.org slash netcommunity slash allen, A-L-L-E-N, Ray, R-E-Y.

397
00:31:02,585 --> 00:31:04,565
[SPEAKER_05]: That's all one word, A-L-L-E-N, R-E-Y.

398
00:31:05,146 --> 00:31:16,148
[SPEAKER_05]: I do want to say, though, if you just want to check out what Extra Life's all about in general, I'm sure TKL Ray would not mind if you just donate to somebody that's participating, extralife.sarcastiggamer.com.

399
00:31:16,621 --> 00:31:17,261
[SPEAKER_05]: Sarkastic Gamer

400
00:31:41,804 --> 00:31:42,205
[SPEAKER_05]: No!

401
00:31:45,206 --> 00:31:47,648
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know how to pronounce this name, but I'll try.

402
00:31:47,768 --> 00:31:48,748
[SPEAKER_05]: Sponchtwang?

403
00:31:49,409 --> 00:31:52,290
[SPEAKER_05]: S-P-O-N-C-H-T-W-A-N-G Sponchtwang?

404
00:31:52,370 --> 00:31:52,871
[SPEAKER_00]: Close enough.

405
00:31:53,598 --> 00:31:56,479
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you guys think about Konami rolling out the official DDR tourney?

406
00:31:57,059 --> 00:32:09,482
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, Konami announced they are doing an official DDR tournament that is going to be in certain cities across the US and it all kind of comes to a head at an official Vegas tournament.

407
00:32:09,542 --> 00:32:13,202
[SPEAKER_05]: But in order to go to the one in Vegas, you have to win one of the satellite competitions that's happening.

408
00:32:13,323 --> 00:32:13,883
[SPEAKER_01]: Qualifiers.

409
00:32:14,163 --> 00:32:14,983
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, basically.

410
00:32:15,343 --> 00:32:17,423
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think there is one happening in NorCal.

411
00:32:17,543 --> 00:32:19,224
[SPEAKER_05]: I think the closest one is in the LA area.

412
00:32:20,404 --> 00:32:23,486
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a shame, because a bunch of the really good... I may be wrong.

413
00:32:23,526 --> 00:32:24,367
[SPEAKER_05]: Please don't quote me on that.

414
00:32:24,387 --> 00:32:26,808
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't have the slide up in front of me, but yeah.

415
00:32:27,248 --> 00:32:36,014
[SPEAKER_01]: I think a lot of the... I mean, this comes from watching a lot of videos and seeing a lot of people, but I really do think that some of the best players were in the Bay Area.

416
00:32:37,331 --> 00:32:40,295
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's good that Konami's finally doing this.

417
00:32:40,695 --> 00:32:43,318
[SPEAKER_05]: I think they're honestly, sadly, about five years too late.

418
00:32:43,418 --> 00:32:46,241
[SPEAKER_05]: I think this is something they should have done when Extreme was out.

419
00:32:46,361 --> 00:32:47,943
[SPEAKER_05]: But fair enough.

420
00:32:47,963 --> 00:32:49,785
[SPEAKER_05]: They're trying to promote some of their new DDR games.

421
00:32:49,905 --> 00:32:54,390
[SPEAKER_05]: I think the one mistake they're making, they didn't give a lot of notice before this tournament happened.

422
00:32:54,790 --> 00:32:58,855
[SPEAKER_05]: It was literally like, hey, this is going to start in Texas next week.

423
00:33:00,196 --> 00:33:01,197
[SPEAKER_05]: It really came out of nowhere.

424
00:33:01,217 --> 00:33:03,218
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think that's probably one of the biggest mistakes they made.

425
00:33:03,599 --> 00:33:13,366
[SPEAKER_05]: Whereas if they just would have given it a little time, like maybe a month, and maybe they did have it out and I just didn't hear about it until a week before, but I don't think there was a lot of notice.

426
00:33:13,647 --> 00:33:17,730
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I want to say the first thing I read on DDR Freak said it was like this weekend.

427
00:33:18,651 --> 00:33:18,851
[SPEAKER_05]: But

428
00:33:19,429 --> 00:33:20,030
[SPEAKER_05]: Super Mario 3 It's so bad.

429
00:33:47,153 --> 00:33:50,957
[SPEAKER_05]: Von Johnson on Twitter wants to know, what do you guys think about Borderlands?

430
00:33:51,277 --> 00:33:55,301
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I don't know much about this game, but I did a little bit of research, just because of your Twitter question.

431
00:33:55,801 --> 00:33:59,685
[SPEAKER_05]: Apparently this is a first-person shooter, but it also has RPG elements mixed in.

432
00:34:00,186 --> 00:34:04,350
[SPEAKER_05]: It's being made by Gearbox, and 2K is publishing it, and it's coming out on PC, of course.

433
00:34:04,710 --> 00:34:05,691
[SPEAKER_05]: PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.

434
00:34:05,971 --> 00:34:07,332
[SPEAKER_05]: It's coming out in October.

435
00:34:08,213 --> 00:34:09,514
[SPEAKER_05]: They want to make a franchise out of it.

436
00:34:09,694 --> 00:34:16,659
[SPEAKER_05]: Honestly, when I'm first looking at this, just the box art and even some of the screenshots, I'm kind of like, they're kind of going for the Fallout audience.

437
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:19,281
[SPEAKER_05]: This looks a lot like kind of what Fallout is all about.

438
00:34:19,301 --> 00:34:21,163
[SPEAKER_01]: If I want a Fallout game, I'll play Fallout.

439
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:24,821
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, it's certainly... And then I'll throw up because I get motion sick.

440
00:34:25,001 --> 00:34:26,521
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, here's the other thing you should know.

441
00:34:27,081 --> 00:34:29,482
[SPEAKER_05]: It does do random level generation.

442
00:34:29,542 --> 00:34:31,163
[SPEAKER_05]: It's kind of got something like Diablo.

443
00:34:31,243 --> 00:34:32,503
[SPEAKER_05]: They're kind of saying it was like that.

444
00:34:32,883 --> 00:34:35,444
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, certainly this has its own merits.

445
00:34:35,764 --> 00:34:36,464
[SPEAKER_05]: So things like that.

446
00:34:36,924 --> 00:34:42,846
[SPEAKER_05]: A content creation system, which will influence some of the weapons that you see in-game in the game world and the map.

447
00:34:43,246 --> 00:34:47,747
[SPEAKER_05]: So it sounds like this is something that's going to kind of develop uniquely for each person.

448
00:34:47,767 --> 00:34:48,647
[SPEAKER_05]: That sounds kind of cool.

449
00:34:48,947 --> 00:34:50,028
[SPEAKER_05]: Especially for an RPG.

450
00:34:50,108 --> 00:34:50,748
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a little weird.

451
00:34:50,768 --> 00:34:50,868
[SPEAKER_01]: Well...

452
00:34:52,293 --> 00:34:55,710
[SPEAKER_01]: Weren't some of the dungeons in Phantasy Star, the earlier Phantasy Star games?

453
00:34:56,343 --> 00:34:57,064
[SPEAKER_05]: Fight to the Death

454
00:35:22,745 --> 00:35:28,727
[SPEAKER_05]: So this certainly sounds like kind of an original game, you know, even though we're making jokes that it sounds a lot like Fallout.

455
00:35:28,767 --> 00:35:32,048
[SPEAKER_05]: It definitely sounds like it has some unique features that try to make it set it apart.

456
00:35:32,128 --> 00:35:34,508
[SPEAKER_05]: So hopefully they release a demo.

457
00:35:35,449 --> 00:35:37,029
[SPEAKER_05]: That would be my biggest thing.

458
00:35:37,389 --> 00:35:38,730
[SPEAKER_01]: I probably still wouldn't try it out.

459
00:35:39,510 --> 00:35:40,970
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you have the whole motion sick thing going on.

460
00:35:41,110 --> 00:35:42,651
[SPEAKER_05]: You just don't play first person shooters in general.

461
00:35:43,071 --> 00:35:46,812
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't play a lot, but there are a few that I got really into.

462
00:35:47,052 --> 00:35:47,672
[SPEAKER_05]: But most of them are old.

463
00:35:47,692 --> 00:35:50,013
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they're going to be anytime soon as long as Dan's got ODST.

464
00:35:50,865 --> 00:36:19,257
[SPEAKER_05]: Quake, Duke Nukem, 3D those are the games I'm talking about that I got into I haven't gotten into a shooter I played a little bit of Halo the last one I played any severe amount of was Hexen now that is an old school shooting I wish there would be a game like that again like the whole magical mystical first person shooter type of thing that was a rad game Hexen was great just the whole problem being that was still sprite based and you know I think wasn't Heretic 2 the one that they did

465
00:36:25,556 --> 00:36:34,505
[SPEAKER_05]: DoctorOfWarC or DoctorOfWork on Twitter who has a cute little chibi squirtle icon wants to know the last CD or song you bought.

466
00:36:34,605 --> 00:36:35,606
[SPEAKER_05]: I said anything goes.

467
00:36:36,226 --> 00:36:37,628
[SPEAKER_05]: Last CD or song you bought.

468
00:36:41,031 --> 00:36:41,771
[SPEAKER_01]: Physical CD?

469
00:36:42,611 --> 00:36:44,933
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh god, I can't even remember the last physical CD I bought.

470
00:36:44,953 --> 00:36:46,994
[SPEAKER_05]: That was too long ago.

471
00:36:47,094 --> 00:36:49,436
[SPEAKER_01]: The World's Greatest Mashups Part 2.

472
00:36:50,216 --> 00:36:50,536
[SPEAKER_05]: Really?

473
00:36:50,776 --> 00:36:50,997
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

474
00:36:51,257 --> 00:36:51,497
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice.

475
00:36:52,598 --> 00:36:58,682
[SPEAKER_01]: As far as an actual song, I bought actually what my cage match pick was.

476
00:36:59,963 --> 00:37:01,264
[SPEAKER_05]: Which didn't win, I'm sorry to tell you.

477
00:37:01,484 --> 00:37:04,486
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki picked some song out of thin air and we both lost by one vote.

478
00:37:04,526 --> 00:37:05,427
[SPEAKER_01]: He pulled it out of his ass.

479
00:37:05,467 --> 00:37:05,747
[SPEAKER_05]: He did.

480
00:37:05,887 --> 00:37:06,327
[SPEAKER_05]: He always does.

481
00:37:06,707 --> 00:37:08,008
[SPEAKER_01]: But it was all the Kylie stuff.

482
00:37:08,268 --> 00:37:09,229
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

483
00:37:09,369 --> 00:37:13,452
[SPEAKER_05]: I would say the last song I bought, funny enough, there's a story behind this.

484
00:37:13,492 --> 00:37:16,193
[SPEAKER_05]: The last song I bought was Limbo Rock by Chubby Checker.

485
00:37:17,314 --> 00:37:18,195
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, that's right.

486
00:37:19,255 --> 00:37:26,562
[SPEAKER_05]: No joke, go back, it's in my iTunes receipt.

487
00:37:26,622 --> 00:37:28,343
[SPEAKER_05]: I wish I had it on this computer, I'd play it.

488
00:37:28,904 --> 00:37:30,565
[SPEAKER_05]: But it was actually, it was for Rocky.

489
00:37:31,066 --> 00:37:37,271
[SPEAKER_05]: I bought it because there was a new little pre-showed game we did that was the limbo, so I had to get the song for that, but that's the last song I bought.

490
00:37:37,372 --> 00:37:38,453
[SPEAKER_01]: What was your last physical CD?

491
00:37:39,335 --> 00:37:39,695
[SPEAKER_05]: Regina Spector

492
00:37:52,904 --> 00:38:15,321
[SPEAKER_05]: I actually think the last physical CD I bought was Flavors of Entanglement by Alanis Morissette and that came out like a year ago I just don't really buy physical CDs I'm pretty sure that it wasn't the mashups disc was the last one that I bought but I'll be damned if I can remember what it is I know what it was, Video Games Live I bought it at the concert

493
00:38:17,619 --> 00:38:18,059
[SPEAKER_05]: There you go.

494
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:24,343
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's a great place to get physical CDs, is at concerts, because sometimes you need to sign them there.

495
00:38:25,623 --> 00:38:29,585
[SPEAKER_05]: Simslova wants to know, what games are you excited about for next month?

496
00:38:30,706 --> 00:38:31,947
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm still catching up on last month.

497
00:38:32,767 --> 00:38:34,228
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't been able to play crap.

498
00:38:34,788 --> 00:38:35,809
[SPEAKER_05]: You were out because of your hand.

499
00:38:36,269 --> 00:38:38,770
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep, I am still kind of out on my hand.

500
00:38:38,890 --> 00:38:40,631
[SPEAKER_05]: You never even played Marvel Ultimate Alliance, did you?

501
00:38:41,032 --> 00:38:42,792
[SPEAKER_01]: No, in fact, look, right here.

502
00:38:43,293 --> 00:38:43,753
[SPEAKER_01]: Look at this.

503
00:38:44,153 --> 00:38:44,834
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my god, a sealed copy.

504
00:38:47,219 --> 00:38:49,744
[SPEAKER_01]: and I really freaking want to play it so I can get my Deadpool on.

505
00:38:49,985 --> 00:38:50,466
[SPEAKER_01]: Poor thing.

506
00:38:50,806 --> 00:38:56,678
[SPEAKER_01]: I think my team is going to be Deadpool and uh uh Ms.

507
00:38:56,719 --> 00:38:58,081
[SPEAKER_01]: Marvel and uh

508
00:38:59,204 --> 00:39:00,866
[SPEAKER_05]: Phoenix, and Captain America.

509
00:39:19,137 --> 00:39:22,900
[SPEAKER_05]: Really, in looking at the releases, DJ Hero clearly is a game I want to get.

510
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:30,064
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, kind of slipping under the radar, I mean, there's a lot of big releases between Gran Turismo, PSP, Uncharted 2 certainly is going to be worth a look.

511
00:39:30,364 --> 00:39:32,906
[SPEAKER_05]: But I do want to point out Demon's Souls is coming out on the PlayStation 3.

512
00:39:33,366 --> 00:39:34,707
[SPEAKER_05]: That was a game I checked out at E3.

513
00:39:34,787 --> 00:39:37,649
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's been out in Japan for a little while, but they're adapting it over here.

514
00:39:38,069 --> 00:39:40,270
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like an RPG, but it's supposed to be super hard.

515
00:39:40,650 --> 00:39:45,113
[SPEAKER_05]: And especially with White Knight Chronicles getting pushed back to next year, I think I do want to pick up Demon's Souls and check it out.

516
00:39:45,393 --> 00:39:47,935
[SPEAKER_05]: That's actually a PlayStation 3 exclusive, if I remember correctly.

517
00:39:48,917 --> 00:39:53,522
[SPEAKER_05]: Um... Nutman wants to know in chat... Yes, that's the name.

518
00:39:53,542 --> 00:39:54,203
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry, not chat.

519
00:39:54,243 --> 00:39:55,244
[SPEAKER_05]: That's Twitter again.

520
00:39:55,725 --> 00:39:58,047
[SPEAKER_05]: For Rob, a question just for me.

521
00:39:59,368 --> 00:40:01,431
[SPEAKER_05]: Would you go straight for Alicia Keys?

522
00:40:01,771 --> 00:40:02,332
[SPEAKER_05]: Be honest.

523
00:40:03,773 --> 00:40:03,853
[SPEAKER_05]: Um...

524
00:40:05,046 --> 00:40:06,947
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I have to say no.

525
00:40:08,167 --> 00:40:09,168
[SPEAKER_05]: Not for Alicia Keys.

526
00:40:09,688 --> 00:40:17,471
[SPEAKER_05]: And I could get into this whole tirade about I don't really believe there is going straight in quotes or going gay.

527
00:40:17,912 --> 00:40:21,593
[SPEAKER_05]: There is just liking who you want to like, as I call it.

528
00:40:22,594 --> 00:40:31,998
[SPEAKER_05]: I go ahead and classify myself gay because I like guys mostly, but I'm not going to say I would never, ever, ever, ever, ever want to kiss a girl.

529
00:40:33,118 --> 00:40:33,518
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura.com

530
00:41:01,809 --> 00:41:02,829
[SPEAKER_01]: Like my soul!

531
00:41:04,910 --> 00:41:06,050
[SPEAKER_05]: Dark Forest Green.

532
00:41:06,550 --> 00:41:08,310
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm actually really fond of dark, dark red.

533
00:41:08,750 --> 00:41:13,771
[SPEAKER_05]: There's actually an in-joke amongst a lot of my friends that I always wear earth colors.

534
00:41:14,411 --> 00:41:20,473
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, I pretty much always am wearing brown, green, black, you know, like earthy colors.

535
00:41:20,613 --> 00:41:21,193
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not today.

536
00:41:21,453 --> 00:41:22,873
[SPEAKER_05]: Funny enough, today I'm wearing all blue.

537
00:41:23,413 --> 00:41:26,374
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a little blue stripy shirt and blue jeans on today.

538
00:41:26,434 --> 00:41:27,254
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm wearing gray.

539
00:41:28,624 --> 00:41:29,645
[SPEAKER_01]: Acrylic is a bitch to wash out

540
00:41:50,950 --> 00:41:56,213
[SPEAKER_05]: I got one more question on the Twitter that just came in a little bit ago while we've been taping and I'll give this one more reload before we sign off tonight.

541
00:41:56,233 --> 00:41:56,753
[SPEAKER_05]: This is fun.

542
00:41:56,873 --> 00:41:58,634
[SPEAKER_05]: I like this for a random show when there's not a lot of news.

543
00:41:59,534 --> 00:42:00,795
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, Soda or Pop?

544
00:42:00,995 --> 00:42:04,096
[SPEAKER_05]: Asks Spazinator PSN on Twitter.

545
00:42:05,257 --> 00:42:05,557
[SPEAKER_05]: Soda.

546
00:42:05,757 --> 00:42:05,997
[SPEAKER_05]: Easy.

547
00:42:06,858 --> 00:42:07,838
[SPEAKER_05]: I hate Pop.

548
00:42:08,138 --> 00:42:09,459
[SPEAKER_05]: I hate it when people call it Pop.

549
00:42:10,039 --> 00:42:11,520
[SPEAKER_05]: It just bugs me.

550
00:42:11,540 --> 00:42:12,460
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like nails on a chalkboard.

551
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:13,721
[SPEAKER_05]: Pop is what you do to bubble gum.

552
00:42:13,961 --> 00:42:16,422
[SPEAKER_05]: Pop is what you do to bubbles when somebody blows them.

553
00:42:16,903 --> 00:42:19,604
[SPEAKER_01]: Technically, the name is Soda Pop.

554
00:42:20,166 --> 00:42:21,608
[SPEAKER_05]: I get that, but it just sounds weird.

555
00:42:43,689 --> 00:42:45,711
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm okay with that, even though I prefer Pepsi.

556
00:42:45,991 --> 00:42:47,853
[SPEAKER_01]: Pepsi is so much better because Coke tastes like poo.

557
00:42:48,554 --> 00:42:53,959
[SPEAKER_01]: But now, when I go into a restaurant, and it throws people off so much.

558
00:42:56,322 --> 00:42:57,123
[SPEAKER_01]: Can I get you a drink?

559
00:42:57,223 --> 00:42:58,324
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd like a Diet Cola.

560
00:42:59,503 --> 00:43:00,124
[SPEAKER_05]: Ah, cola.

561
00:43:00,704 --> 00:43:01,585
[SPEAKER_05]: That's when you don't hear a lot.

562
00:43:01,605 --> 00:43:06,270
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I don't like, I don't really care for the Sprite type drinks, you know.

563
00:43:06,711 --> 00:43:09,493
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'll say, I would like a diet cola, whichever one you have.

564
00:43:10,514 --> 00:43:12,757
[SPEAKER_01]: So that way they won't do, is Coke okay?

565
00:43:13,257 --> 00:43:14,058
[SPEAKER_01]: Is Pepsi okay?

566
00:43:14,238 --> 00:43:15,680
[SPEAKER_01]: I just said whichever one.

567
00:43:17,121 --> 00:43:18,262
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't care.

568
00:43:18,443 --> 00:43:22,427
[SPEAKER_05]: You know there's a, you know they have to do that though because plenty of people bitch about it when it's not the right one.

569
00:43:22,527 --> 00:43:22,647
[SPEAKER_01]: But,

570
00:43:23,962 --> 00:43:25,603
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's why I specify.

571
00:43:25,623 --> 00:43:26,503
[SPEAKER_01]: And you've heard me do it.

572
00:43:27,544 --> 00:43:29,925
[SPEAKER_01]: I will take a diet cola whichever one you have.

573
00:43:30,945 --> 00:43:32,626
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a blanket permission.

574
00:43:33,026 --> 00:43:38,408
[SPEAKER_01]: If you don't have Coke or Pepsi but you have RC Cola, by all means, give me the RC.

575
00:43:38,948 --> 00:43:47,192
[SPEAKER_05]: Which, by the way, I was going to say, when I hear the word cola, I think of RC Cola and I think of Shasta Cola, which I don't even think they probably sell outside of Markel.

576
00:43:47,212 --> 00:43:47,872
[SPEAKER_01]: You remember Faygo?

577
00:43:47,892 --> 00:43:49,413
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

578
00:43:50,663 --> 00:43:52,825
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

579
00:44:16,161 --> 00:44:20,644
[SPEAKER_05]: I drink diet soda Rob, I have to give up my diet soda and my coffee and black tea I can have green tea Can you have Sprite?

580
00:44:40,905 --> 00:44:41,706
[SPEAKER_01]: What's the point?

581
00:44:41,787 --> 00:44:44,110
[SPEAKER_01]: Caffeine.

582
00:44:44,170 --> 00:44:46,874
[SPEAKER_01]: The only type of caffeinated drink I'm supposed to have is green tea.

583
00:44:46,914 --> 00:44:47,915
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, the hell with that.

584
00:44:47,955 --> 00:44:48,676
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm having coffee.

585
00:44:49,217 --> 00:44:51,420
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'll have my one cup of coffee in the morning.

586
00:44:52,342 --> 00:44:52,442
[SPEAKER_01]: One.

587
00:44:52,462 --> 00:44:52,522
[SPEAKER_01]: One.

588
00:44:53,871 --> 00:44:54,891
[SPEAKER_05]: We had really good Chinese food.

589
00:45:16,596 --> 00:45:17,097
[SPEAKER_05]: and Asen.

590
00:45:17,337 --> 00:45:18,078
[SPEAKER_05]: I got to see him again.

591
00:45:18,138 --> 00:45:19,699
[SPEAKER_05]: So he's a good guy.

592
00:45:19,719 --> 00:45:20,841
[SPEAKER_05]: I wish his show would come back.

593
00:45:21,321 --> 00:45:25,706
[SPEAKER_05]: That was a slick show that this day in gaming that he had.

594
00:45:25,726 --> 00:45:26,186
[SPEAKER_05]: I know it was T-Day.

595
00:45:26,206 --> 00:45:27,287
[SPEAKER_05]: I was trying to remember what it stood for.

596
00:45:27,968 --> 00:45:30,410
[SPEAKER_05]: This day in gaming that he had that he... It was a slick show.

597
00:45:30,451 --> 00:45:33,634
[SPEAKER_05]: He has a really good voice for radio and the guy that edited it did a really good job.

598
00:45:34,255 --> 00:45:34,395
[SPEAKER_05]: So...

599
00:45:35,441 --> 00:45:42,144
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyhow, Rob D asks in chat, first thing he said, what is your favorite Japanese media depiction of an American?

600
00:45:42,824 --> 00:45:43,704
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a good question.

601
00:45:44,185 --> 00:45:46,586
[SPEAKER_05]: Mine is and will forever be Terry Bogard.

602
00:45:49,127 --> 00:45:49,747
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

603
00:45:49,787 --> 00:45:51,428
[SPEAKER_05]: This is one I'd really have to get some thought to.

604
00:45:51,468 --> 00:45:53,329
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't think of any big stereotypes that jump out at me.

605
00:45:53,789 --> 00:46:03,833
[SPEAKER_01]: I would have to say from Axis Powers, Hetalia, America, who is always sitting in the corner eating cheeseburgers and giving emphatic orders.

606
00:46:06,290 --> 00:46:08,152
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to take the question in a different direction here.

607
00:46:08,192 --> 00:46:15,897
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not my favorite Japanese media depiction of an American, but my favorite British depiction of an American was Bubbles from Absolutely Fabulous.

608
00:46:17,178 --> 00:46:21,461
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure none of our listeners are going to get that reference, but that was my favorite depiction of an American.

609
00:46:24,478 --> 00:46:43,893
[SPEAKER_01]: The only thing that's coming to mind, and it's not even her depicting an American, it's her depicting a Welsh... It's Dawn French doing her imitation of Catherine Zeta-Jones, but slipping into a fully California-American accent.

610
00:46:43,913 --> 00:46:45,915
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just, oh, my California's showing!

611
00:46:45,935 --> 00:46:46,556
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

612
00:46:47,256 --> 00:46:47,496
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice.

613
00:46:49,277 --> 00:46:50,377
[SPEAKER_01]: I have to do it right.

614
00:46:52,258 --> 00:46:53,359
[SPEAKER_01]: Catherine Zeta Douglas.

615
00:46:53,379 --> 00:46:55,400
[SPEAKER_01]: I lost it.

616
00:46:56,560 --> 00:46:57,941
[SPEAKER_05]: Is this something people can look up on YouTube?

617
00:46:57,961 --> 00:46:59,502
[SPEAKER_01]: Catherine Zeta Douglas, Spartacus Jones.

618
00:47:00,082 --> 00:47:00,962
[SPEAKER_05]: Spartacus Jones?

619
00:47:01,002 --> 00:47:01,222
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

620
00:47:01,963 --> 00:47:07,325
[SPEAKER_01]: Just look up Don French or French and Saunders and Catherine Zeta Jones.

621
00:47:07,545 --> 00:47:08,285
[SPEAKER_01]: It's hilarious.

622
00:47:09,626 --> 00:47:10,747
[SPEAKER_01]: Especially the Roundabout one.

623
00:47:10,787 --> 00:47:11,347
[SPEAKER_01]: That one's funny.

624
00:47:12,475 --> 00:47:12,755
[SPEAKER_05]: I think... Hmm.

625
00:47:35,356 --> 00:47:36,717
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's a necessary evil.

626
00:47:36,837 --> 00:47:41,302
[SPEAKER_05]: And I know that's totally like I just picked none of the above in a way, which is sad.

627
00:47:41,362 --> 00:47:45,506
[SPEAKER_05]: But the problem is that it's not just the gaming industry that I think has to deal with this.

628
00:47:45,846 --> 00:47:49,129
[SPEAKER_05]: The movie industry, to a certain extent, definitely has to deal with this big time.

629
00:47:49,970 --> 00:47:54,514
[SPEAKER_05]: Sites like ain'titcoolnews.com or everybody's got a movie blog, it seems these days.

630
00:47:54,894 --> 00:47:55,135
[SPEAKER_05]: You know,

631
00:47:55,715 --> 00:48:05,526
[SPEAKER_05]: and bitchy people like Perez Hilton in some of these gossip blogs will oftentimes ruin a movie before it comes out with spoilers and things that it stinks.

632
00:48:05,966 --> 00:48:06,387
[SPEAKER_05]: Think about it.

633
00:48:07,348 --> 00:48:12,473
[SPEAKER_05]: I know most of us, even I'm too young to remember this, but when...

634
00:48:13,686 --> 00:48:16,108
[SPEAKER_05]: The Empire Strikes Back originally came out.

635
00:48:16,788 --> 00:48:18,849
[SPEAKER_05]: No, Return of the Jedi originally came out.

636
00:48:18,949 --> 00:48:22,031
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was revealed that Darth Vader was Luke's father.

637
00:48:22,952 --> 00:48:24,072
[SPEAKER_05]: That was Empire Strikes Back.

638
00:48:24,092 --> 00:48:25,153
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, leading into Return of the Jedi.

639
00:48:25,173 --> 00:48:25,794
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember this.

640
00:48:27,074 --> 00:48:29,436
[SPEAKER_05]: That was such a huge fucking thing.

641
00:48:30,076 --> 00:48:32,318
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh my gosh, what a shock.

642
00:48:32,418 --> 00:48:33,298
[SPEAKER_05]: What a surprise.

643
00:48:34,159 --> 00:48:36,380
[SPEAKER_05]: That would not be possible in this day and age.

644
00:48:36,440 --> 00:48:36,920
[SPEAKER_05]: Think about it.

645
00:48:37,221 --> 00:48:40,563
[SPEAKER_05]: A huge reveal like that would have been spoiled on the internet a month before the movie was released.

646
00:48:40,843 --> 00:48:40,923
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

647
00:48:41,343 --> 00:48:42,324
[SPEAKER_05]: Snape killed Dumbledore!

648
00:49:03,818 --> 00:49:06,220
[SPEAKER_01]: I did very well to hide myself.

649
00:49:06,940 --> 00:49:12,684
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, even though I figured out that something like that was going to happen from the freaking beginning of the damn book.

650
00:49:13,024 --> 00:49:14,485
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi!

651
00:49:17,086 --> 00:49:18,807
[SPEAKER_01]: Especially when the last book came out.

652
00:49:19,467 --> 00:49:27,292
[SPEAKER_01]: I hid myself in a hole and made sure to read everything that day before I let myself read anything on the internet.

653
00:49:28,533 --> 00:49:29,514
[SPEAKER_05]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

654
00:49:58,277 --> 00:50:15,491
[SPEAKER_05]: and, you know, live performances, television, every artistic foray, which yes, gaming is one, we can have that discussion another day if you want, is, you know, is a part of, is subject to this scrutiny that is, you know, the blogosphere that we live in now.

655
00:50:15,952 --> 00:50:17,012
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just the way it is.

656
00:50:18,053 --> 00:50:23,678
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, I think companies to overcome that kind of have to be smart in how they do things, but it's really hard to keep a secret.

657
00:50:24,078 --> 00:50:30,583
[SPEAKER_05]: Look at what happened to Sony and having everything spoiled, except Final Fantasy 14 was one of the only secrets they had.

658
00:50:30,963 --> 00:50:32,825
[SPEAKER_05]: Most of their big things were spoiled.

659
00:50:33,065 --> 00:50:37,048
[SPEAKER_05]: And now you had this whole Sega, uh, Sony thing we talked about on the show last week.

660
00:50:37,388 --> 00:50:38,950
[SPEAKER_05]: That was a huge spoiler thing too.

661
00:50:39,270 --> 00:50:44,294
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, it's very hard to keep a secret anymore, but if the product is really, really good, it's going to transcend all that.

662
00:50:45,135 --> 00:50:46,396
[SPEAKER_01]: I totally agree with that.

663
00:50:46,416 --> 00:50:51,703
[SPEAKER_01]: How many people who had their Harry Potter spoilers still went out and got the book?

664
00:50:51,743 --> 00:50:55,007
[SPEAKER_05]: Going back to the original question, because we totally digressed from the question and probably missed the point.

665
00:50:55,728 --> 00:50:58,832
[SPEAKER_05]: Has the gaming community helped or stunted the gaming industry?

666
00:50:59,452 --> 00:51:01,215
[SPEAKER_05]: In the end, it doesn't matter.

667
00:51:01,535 --> 00:51:02,897
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not a switch we can turn off.

668
00:51:03,885 --> 00:51:12,729
[SPEAKER_05]: But I would honestly say the answer is a little of column A and a little of column B. It's probably made things better as far as promoting.

669
00:51:13,109 --> 00:51:24,174
[SPEAKER_05]: I think games like Scribblenauts, Braid, some of these games, I don't think would have sold as well or been quite as talked about if it weren't for the internet.

670
00:51:24,520 --> 00:51:29,124
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the concepts of some of these games wouldn't have even existed if not for the internet.

671
00:51:29,144 --> 00:51:33,748
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, Scribblenauts itself has so many internet jokes in it.

672
00:51:34,308 --> 00:51:34,629
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi!

673
00:51:35,409 --> 00:51:36,570
[SPEAKER_05]: But has it hurt things?

674
00:51:36,930 --> 00:51:37,151
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure.

675
00:51:37,851 --> 00:51:39,112
[SPEAKER_05]: Has it hurt sales of some games?

676
00:51:39,152 --> 00:51:39,372
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure.

677
00:51:39,413 --> 00:51:43,856
[SPEAKER_05]: But honestly, I don't even know if that's the blog so much as it is probably just piracy.

678
00:51:44,056 --> 00:51:46,839
[SPEAKER_05]: Straight up piracy is easy to do, you know?

679
00:51:48,058 --> 00:51:48,979
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyhow, that was a good question.

680
00:51:49,459 --> 00:51:50,620
[SPEAKER_05]: Want to do one more from the Rob D?

681
00:51:50,940 --> 00:51:51,321
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.

682
00:51:51,621 --> 00:51:55,404
[SPEAKER_05]: Along the same lines, has online multiplayer helped or hurt gaming?

683
00:51:55,864 --> 00:51:59,787
[SPEAKER_05]: Before, a good game could have glitches and they would be ignored or even revered.

684
00:52:00,227 --> 00:52:04,190
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, people will complain that it needs a patch because it will be abused if there's an online component.

685
00:52:07,112 --> 00:52:08,694
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's just a sign of the times.

686
00:52:08,734 --> 00:52:10,555
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I really think that it's just the evolution.

687
00:52:11,716 --> 00:52:15,519
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you move in one direction, you're going to have problems that come because of it, you know.

688
00:52:17,060 --> 00:52:18,962
[SPEAKER_01]: I really think that you can't have one without the other.

689
00:52:19,642 --> 00:52:21,664
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't really see it as a hurt or help.

690
00:52:22,785 --> 00:52:27,789
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to plant myself firmly in the column of I believe multiplayer gaming has helped gaming altogether.

691
00:52:27,889 --> 00:52:31,031
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's created genres of gaming that really wouldn't exist otherwise.

692
00:52:32,172 --> 00:52:33,433
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it hurt arcades.

693
00:52:34,514 --> 00:52:40,359
[SPEAKER_05]: I think multiplayer gaming and the online stuff, I think it hurt arcades and I think that's what finally put the nail in the coffin of arcades.

694
00:52:40,379 --> 00:52:41,740
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it hurt people's social life.

695
00:52:42,279 --> 00:52:44,460
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think it helped gaming in general.

696
00:52:44,820 --> 00:52:45,640
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, let's face it.

697
00:52:45,720 --> 00:52:47,781
[SPEAKER_05]: What is the Xbox 360's biggest strength?

698
00:52:48,341 --> 00:52:48,701
[SPEAKER_02]: Online.

699
00:52:48,961 --> 00:52:49,841
[SPEAKER_05]: It is online.

700
00:52:50,241 --> 00:53:03,145
[SPEAKER_05]: And what is a lot of people, you know, what made it so successful, you know, especially in the beginning over the PlayStation 3, you know, complain all you will about, you know, how Sony maybe botched the launch of the PlayStation 3 that they're trying to make, you know, amends for now.

701
00:53:03,605 --> 00:53:07,046
[SPEAKER_05]: But the online component has always been Xbox 360's greatest strength.

702
00:53:07,466 --> 00:53:10,647
[SPEAKER_05]: What is the one thing most of us are most critical about with the Wii?

703
00:53:11,667 --> 00:53:12,468
[SPEAKER_05]: The lack of online?

704
00:53:12,488 --> 00:53:18,512
[SPEAKER_05]: The lack of online and the lack of ability to patch games and the lack of, you know, we kind of see that as not catering to the hardcore audience.

705
00:53:20,354 --> 00:53:23,356
[SPEAKER_01]: They said though from the get-go that it's not for the hardcore audience.

706
00:53:25,018 --> 00:53:29,861
[SPEAKER_05]: But honestly, I've kind of made friends with online games, as strange as that sounds.

707
00:53:30,302 --> 00:53:30,822
[SPEAKER_05]: I know, I have.

708
00:53:31,162 --> 00:53:40,710
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I mean, I've met people on like LiveJournal that I'll go off and, you know, join my guild in Final Fantasy XI or World of Warcraft or what have you that I've become really good friends with.

709
00:53:41,018 --> 00:53:51,563
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, just along the same token, a lot of the people that I've made friends with out here, they were my online buddies in Alabama, you know, through playing Gemstone.

710
00:53:52,384 --> 00:53:52,684
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, wow.

711
00:53:52,864 --> 00:53:53,785
[SPEAKER_01]: How's that for old school?

712
00:53:53,825 --> 00:53:54,805
[SPEAKER_05]: That is very old school.

713
00:53:54,825 --> 00:53:59,067
[SPEAKER_01]: Or, you know, doing the silly little games on AOL.

714
00:53:59,147 --> 00:53:59,888
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.

715
00:54:01,068 --> 00:54:05,791
[SPEAKER_01]: I met a lot of people who are now my in-person friends, but I met them online.

716
00:54:06,851 --> 00:54:07,672
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, Dan...

717
00:54:09,205 --> 00:54:23,353
[SPEAKER_01]: your husband you met online my husband I met online so I think that while this may have hurt face-to-face social interaction I think that it has opened the doors for people who otherwise would not get out of the house you know

718
00:54:24,662 --> 00:54:25,362
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

719
00:54:42,680 --> 00:54:49,430
[SPEAKER_05]: It's sometimes kind of hard to meet other gay people because not everybody is out with it and a lot of people have to suppress it out there in society.

720
00:54:49,770 --> 00:54:51,613
[SPEAKER_05]: I think the internet's helped a lot of people connect.

721
00:54:51,633 --> 00:54:53,496
[SPEAKER_05]: And I don't think that's necessarily limited to gay culture.

722
00:54:53,556 --> 00:54:55,238
[SPEAKER_05]: That goes for a lot of like...

723
00:54:56,308 --> 00:54:59,710
[SPEAKER_05]: fans of anything or lifestyle.

724
00:54:59,930 --> 00:55:05,314
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, a lot of fringe groups too, you know, people who may think, oh, I'm the only one.

725
00:55:05,414 --> 00:55:06,195
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm the only one.

726
00:55:06,635 --> 00:55:19,503
[SPEAKER_01]: You find out there's other people like you, you know, you may, you know, it's, I think it's fantastic for especially not just as a social tool, but as, as socially informative tool.

727
00:55:19,603 --> 00:55:20,124
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?

728
00:55:20,489 --> 00:55:21,290
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com

729
00:55:39,526 --> 00:56:06,061
[SPEAKER_05]: because I'm able to meet other gay geeks like myself which is ironic because I actually don't go there a whole lot anymore but I went to a party they had once and I had a lot of fun and it was kind of cool because sometimes in gamer culture I feel like the underdog for being gay and you sign on Xbox Live you hear all that stuff and then as the gay guy I sometimes feel like being a nerd I'm on the bottom rung because I'm not a fashionista I don't go to every Madonna concert and all this stuff

730
00:56:06,641 --> 00:56:07,182
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what I mean?

731
00:56:07,582 --> 00:56:08,143
[SPEAKER_01]: I know what you mean.

732
00:56:08,964 --> 00:56:12,708
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why I rolled my eyes, because I see way too much of it.

733
00:56:12,988 --> 00:56:14,269
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't cry for me, Argentina.

734
00:56:14,309 --> 00:56:17,413
[SPEAKER_05]: This happens in any social structure, not just the ones I've mentioned.

735
00:56:17,513 --> 00:56:21,057
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think the internet has allowed us to find people like us, and gaming is a part of that.

736
00:56:22,878 --> 00:56:23,298
[SPEAKER_05]: Think about it.

737
00:56:23,318 --> 00:56:25,079
[SPEAKER_05]: What about the community we have here at Orange Lounge Radio?

738
00:56:25,299 --> 00:56:28,541
[SPEAKER_05]: We've met a lot of awesome people just because they've listened to our show.

739
00:56:29,001 --> 00:56:30,962
[SPEAKER_01]: To use an example directly through a game.

740
00:56:31,542 --> 00:56:36,444
[SPEAKER_01]: One of my friends that I played on the IRO back in the day on the International Ragnarok server.

741
00:56:37,044 --> 00:56:40,686
[SPEAKER_01]: She lives in Canada so we haven't met face to face.

742
00:56:40,746 --> 00:56:41,607
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never been up there.

743
00:56:42,107 --> 00:56:46,189
[SPEAKER_01]: But we're still friends on DeviantArt and through LiveJournal.

744
00:56:46,209 --> 00:56:47,149
[SPEAKER_01]: We still keep in touch.

745
00:56:48,250 --> 00:56:50,591
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm talking seven years ago.

746
00:56:52,507 --> 00:57:12,024
[SPEAKER_01]: I've made, even though these are people that I would never have come into contact with People of vast talent For example, I met Tiara online We were friends online before we had ever gotten to meet in person

747
00:57:14,003 --> 00:57:18,988
[SPEAKER_01]: and now we hang out whenever we can go to each other's towns or go to Disneyland.

748
00:57:19,568 --> 00:57:20,730
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's pretty cool.

749
00:57:21,110 --> 00:57:29,398
[SPEAKER_01]: I've made really lasting friendships through online networking and through games.

750
00:57:30,339 --> 00:57:31,620
[SPEAKER_01]: So, meh.

751
00:57:33,255 --> 00:57:34,696
[SPEAKER_05]: What more question tonight?

752
00:57:34,736 --> 00:57:35,616
[SPEAKER_05]: That was a good discussion.

753
00:57:36,657 --> 00:57:44,280
[SPEAKER_05]: This one comes from DarkTetsuya, and the question is, how likely are you guys to be checking out La Mulana when it hits WiiWare when it's available?

754
00:57:44,660 --> 00:57:47,822
[SPEAKER_05]: I did read the difficulty, at least of the controls, has been adjusted.

755
00:57:48,402 --> 00:57:51,203
[SPEAKER_05]: I really wish there were demos, but that's a whole bigger issue.

756
00:57:51,643 --> 00:57:57,206
[SPEAKER_05]: I still have some extra Wii points from a gift card someone was kind enough to give me for my birthday, so I'll probably use it to pick up this game.

757
00:57:57,486 --> 00:57:59,529
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

758
00:58:12,014 --> 00:58:13,435
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm still thinking about it.

759
00:58:14,696 --> 00:58:20,640
[SPEAKER_01]: Just right now, me playing much of anything is in small doses that I have to be able to take a lot of rest with.

760
00:58:21,120 --> 00:58:23,882
[SPEAKER_05]: Why isn't there like a Nintendo magazine that comes with demos?

761
00:58:24,122 --> 00:58:26,444
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, they do this on the Xbox, they do this on the PlayStation.

762
00:58:26,784 --> 00:58:32,568
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, granted, those discs got made a little obsolete in this era of gaming because we all download our demos online.

763
00:58:32,848 --> 00:58:35,910
[SPEAKER_05]: But remember, like on PlayStation 1, those demo discs used to be the shit.

764
00:58:36,010 --> 00:58:37,531
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a pile of them.

765
00:58:37,651 --> 00:58:38,252
[SPEAKER_05]: They're awesome.

766
00:58:38,832 --> 00:58:43,115
[SPEAKER_05]: Why doesn't Nintendo do something like that to make up for the lack of having an online thing?

767
00:58:43,995 --> 00:58:44,636
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't get that.

768
00:58:45,736 --> 00:58:49,959
[SPEAKER_05]: Wouldn't that be cool if they had a magazine that would have like five games you could play on a disc?

769
00:58:50,159 --> 00:58:52,501
[SPEAKER_01]: They're too busy kissing Miyamoto's ass.

770
00:58:52,701 --> 00:58:54,502
[SPEAKER_05]: Or kissing Soccer Mom's ass or something.

771
00:58:54,542 --> 00:58:55,763
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

772
00:58:56,183 --> 00:58:59,185
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me just reload the Twitter real quick to see if we got any other last questions.

773
00:58:59,325 --> 00:58:59,825
[SPEAKER_05]: No, we didn't.

774
00:58:59,925 --> 00:59:03,107
[SPEAKER_01]: Jeremy keeps trying to get out of the room and then she's like, Ah, the door!

775
00:59:03,788 --> 00:59:04,789
[SPEAKER_01]: And then turning back around.

776
00:59:05,229 --> 00:59:05,349
So.

777
00:59:06,118 --> 00:59:09,181
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll be going to wrap it up in ribbons and bows You know what this means?

778
00:59:26,558 --> 00:59:37,806
[SPEAKER_01]: to sort of tease a little bit an idea that I brought up to you on Sunday about a little one hour thing involving a room in my house that would make it entirely possible.

779
00:59:37,986 --> 00:59:38,606
[SPEAKER_05]: It would.

780
00:59:38,766 --> 00:59:41,788
[SPEAKER_05]: There could be plenty of good fun things in store for us in 2010.

781
00:59:42,088 --> 00:59:42,429
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll see.

782
00:59:42,849 --> 00:59:44,530
[SPEAKER_05]: So thanks to everybody for the questions.

783
00:59:44,570 --> 00:59:46,311
[SPEAKER_05]: If I somehow missed your questions, I'm sorry.

784
00:59:46,351 --> 00:59:47,772
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll roll it over to another show.

785
00:59:48,072 --> 00:59:50,794
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't forget, you can always send us an email, mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com.

786
00:59:51,334 --> 00:59:56,377
[SPEAKER_05]: And thank you guys so much for tuning into our show tonight, even though we weren't live or downloading it, even though it was a little different tonight.

787
00:59:57,337 --> 00:59:58,338
[SPEAKER_05]: I hope you guys have a great week.

788
00:59:58,418 --> 01:00:03,300
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll be back to do our normal show one week from Sunday, which would be October.

789
01:00:03,320 --> 01:00:06,222
[SPEAKER_01]: We need to bring back our missing house guest.

790
01:00:07,203 --> 01:00:07,723
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki.

791
01:00:08,243 --> 01:00:08,783
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, the ferret.

792
01:00:10,224 --> 01:00:12,465
[SPEAKER_01]: To join the ranks of... Do you miss the ferret more than Loki?

793
01:00:12,485 --> 01:00:13,346
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that what you're trying to say?

794
01:00:14,011 --> 01:00:17,293
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, no, no, yes, no.

795
01:00:18,414 --> 01:00:24,437
[SPEAKER_05]: October 11th, we'll be live again at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern on All Games Radio, www.allgames.com.

796
01:00:24,717 --> 01:00:26,098
[SPEAKER_05]: Any final thoughts tonight, DarkSakura?

797
01:00:27,059 --> 01:00:27,639
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm hungry.

798
01:00:29,480 --> 01:00:31,541
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't talked about food all day.

799
01:00:32,342 --> 01:00:34,543
[SPEAKER_05]: That's how you know it's in a typical episode of Orange Sounds Radio.

800
01:00:35,464 --> 01:00:40,426
[SPEAKER_05]: My final thought is, by the time you're hearing this, I will be on Space Mountain Ghost Galaxy.

801
01:00:41,167 --> 01:00:41,447
[SPEAKER_05]: Heart.

802
01:00:42,468 --> 01:00:42,588
[SPEAKER_05]: So...

803
01:00:43,407 --> 01:00:43,767
[SPEAKER_05]: That's it.

804
01:00:44,208 --> 01:00:44,628
[SPEAKER_05]: We're done.

805
01:00:45,169 --> 01:00:45,689
[SPEAKER_05]: We're out of here.

806
01:00:46,850 --> 01:00:49,352
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, let's go to San Francisco so we can wait for the tsunami.

807
01:00:50,193 --> 01:00:52,615
[SPEAKER_05]: The tsunami is not hitting the West Coast, did you hear?

808
01:00:52,975 --> 01:00:53,215
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

809
01:00:54,737 --> 01:00:55,197
[SPEAKER_05]: We're out.

810
01:00:55,237 --> 01:00:55,858
[SPEAKER_05]: Bye, guys.

811
