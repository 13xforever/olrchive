00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Orange Lounge Radio

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:13,000
We the hosts, Dark Sakura, Sky and Loco.

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Orange Lounge Radio

4
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Orange Lounge Radio

5
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Is that Sim Topless? What is the deal over there?

6
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Do you have naked sims on your computer?

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
No, he's not naked, he's just wearing shorts.

8
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Oh hi, we're live. Hi, we're live.

9
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Actually, we're not live, we're taped tonight.

10
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
It's a little special edition of Orange Lounge Radio.

11
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
This is the voice from the past!

12
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
That's right, scary ghost of Christmas past.

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
No, we're pre-taping tonight.

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Obviously, if you've been following OLR, we're out this week.

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
As you guys are hearing this live on All Games Radio,

16
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I am far, far away in a strange, mystical land that they call LA.

17
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Or LA.

18
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Dork.

19
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
So yes, we're having a little bit of a pre-taped show tonight.

20
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
So let me introduce ourselves if you've never heard Orange Lounge Radio before.

21
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I'm very sorry this had to be your first episode,

22
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
but regardless, my name is Rob Roberts,

23
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
and joining me is always say hello to the one and only,

24
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.

25
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Not here tonight, who plays with naked sims, just so you know.

26
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
I'm not playing with naked sims.

27
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Not here tonight is the one and only tech master, Loki.

28
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
We're taping not live on a Tuesday night,

29
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
and Loki just isn't here.

30
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
He didn't show up.

31
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
And to be fair, I didn't call him tonight.

32
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I was going to say, shouldn't you have called?

33
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Well, probably I should have,

34
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
but here's the thing is that then we'd have to wait 30 minutes for him to show up,

35
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
and I'm just like, I want to get the hell out of here and get some dinner tonight.

36
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
He missed the boat.

37
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I want dinner.

38
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Should we call Matt and see where he's at?

39
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Nah.

40
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
No? Let him have his peace?

41
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
He could be being intimate with the wife right now.

42
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
That's true. I don't know.

43
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,000
So Loki, I guess, just forgot that we were going to pre-tape a show Tuesday night.

44
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Technically, we're just taping.

45
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
He's missed.

46
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Our aim is always improving, though.

47
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
How do you pre-tape?

48
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Silly little...

49
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
That's what they call it. That's industry speak for...

50
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Silly little prefixes.

51
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Now, I think we were going to do a best of tonight or something.

52
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I think we're going to roll that over until later,

53
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,000
because one of our listeners slash staff members,

54
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
in other words, he listened so long we decided to just make him a staff member,

55
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Dar Tetsuya, is like putting something together out of some really old episodes.

56
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
And, of course, this wouldn't be...

57
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,000
It just wouldn't be OLR if the music I didn't intend to play started playing.

58
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,000
There we go.

59
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
How does that happen, even when we're not live?

60
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I had two songs queued up tonight.

61
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:01,000
The open and the Twitter topic song, which we'll get into a little later.

62
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
I fail.

63
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Isn't it nice to know that even when we're not live,

64
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
we can still have technical difficulties?

65
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Amazing.

66
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
It wouldn't be us if we didn't.

67
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
That's right.

68
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Well, usually we would start off the show with a little bit of how was your gaming week,

69
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,000
although we're only about two days since we taped the last episode of Orange is on its Radio.

70
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I don't know if there's a lot new going on, but I'll ask, Dark Soccer,

71
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
is there anything exciting going on in your gaming week?

72
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Sims 3 and Peggle.

73
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
That's about it.

74
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
It's pretty much the same story with me.

75
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Sims 3 and Peggle. Wow. What a coincidence.

76
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
No, I'm not playing Sims 3 and Peggle.

77
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I'm playing WoW and Bejeweled.

78
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
There you go.

79
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
And Bejeweled in WoW, actually.

80
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
I'm actually gonna...

81
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Hopefully if I can scrounge together the 14 bucks,

82
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I'll pay for a couple months of my account.

83
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
You should definitely come back. It's crackalicious.

84
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I never really got into it, you know.

85
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Yeah?

86
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Why do you think you never were able to get into WoW?

87
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I mean, certainly, there's plenty of our listeners who don't play Warcraft.

88
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
And there's some that do.

89
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
What is it that made you not really want to stick with it?

90
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
I'd hit around level 7 and go,

91
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,000
What the hell am I doing with my time?

92
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I guess that's what I hear from a lot of people.

93
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Because, you know, like, when I was...

94
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I had a fun time playing with Tiara a while back.

95
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,000
But it's like, I'm not a get up and Questarama type person

96
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
and zip through them.

97
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I like to explore a little bit and take it, you know, kind of slow.

98
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
And it's like, this is kind of boring.

99
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
This is kind of boring.

100
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
It almost sounds like you're talking about something dirty.

101
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
It's kind of boring.

102
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:36,000
I like to take my time and explore a little bit slow.

103
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Eh, it's kind of boring.

104
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:44,000
I mean, I have a good time if I'm playing with people.

105
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Oh, shut up.

106
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Are you talking about WoW or what?

107
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:54,000
With regards to World of Warcraft, I have a better time playing with a friend

108
00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:02,000
when I've got something to shut up.

109
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Alright.

110
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:08,000
But what I was saying is more fun when I have other people to participate in the game with.

111
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
I see. Fair enough.

112
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Of all the things in this room, you threw a box of Kleenex at me.

113
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Yep.

114
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
You almost hit Shermie.

115
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
But if it landed on Shermie, it wouldn't hurt her.

116
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Alright.

117
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
You notice who did not budge?

118
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Shermie, yeah.

119
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:29,000
She just parks her badass there next to the very warm computer for pretty much the night.

120
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
That's her little fortress of solitude.

121
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Alright.

122
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Well, on tonight's show...

123
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Oh, I actually did play one new game I want to talk about.

124
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
So, we'll give them something new.

125
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
I played Luminous for the iPhone.

126
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Did you say Bluminous?

127
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
No, Luminous.

128
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I thought so, but...

129
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Or Lumines, as some people call it.

130
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Luminous. Luminous.

131
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:54,000
This is the puzzle game that, of course, was hugely, disgustingly popular on the PSP, and rightfully so.

132
00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:00,000
And then it had a sequel come out on the PSP that I don't think was quite as well received, even though it had Hollaback Girl.

133
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,000
And then it had versions on the PlayStation Network, as well as Xbox Live.

134
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:09,000
The Xbox Live version, of course, was highly criticized for being kind of the first microtransaction-y game.

135
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
I hate that word.

136
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Lots and lots of little things to download and add to the game.

137
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Now it's out on iPhone.

138
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
And I love Luminous.

139
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Like, Luminous is one of my favorite puzzle games ever.

140
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Because you know I love music games, and I love the whole infusion and all that.

141
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Kind of like how the music plays a part in the puzzle game.

142
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Where, you know, if you've never played Luminous before, basically you're trying to make blocks of varying size out of 4x4 blocks of different colors.

143
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:41,000
But the bar that sweeps across the field moves in time to the music.

144
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:45,000
And as you move the blocks around, the beats that it makes kind of fit in with the music.

145
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Is it worth the purchase to you?

146
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Well, here's the thing.

147
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
On the iPhone, it sucks.

148
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
It sucks.

149
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
It sucks.

150
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
I hate it.

151
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
It is awful.

152
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:04,000
The version of Luminous that I played on my old Sprint cell phone that had a four directional key and stuff was more fun to play.

153
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
And let me tell you why.

154
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:12,000
It's all about, and the reason why I'm so harsh on this game, because honestly, it's got some new skins.

155
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
It is a very nice looking game.

156
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:21,000
But the reason why I got so frustrated with this, I wanted to throw my phone across the room, is that the controls are shit.

157
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:26,000
And the reason why is that they made one key design flaw.

158
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:33,000
And that flaw is that in order to move the bricks, you touch the screen and you move your finger left, or you move your finger right.

159
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
But to drop it, you move your finger down.

160
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
So what do you think happens when I'm playing...

161
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Keep dropping it.

162
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Exactly.

163
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:46,000
That's exactly what happens when I play Luminous on the phone, is that when I'm trying to move bricks left and right...

164
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Oh, and you tap the screen to rotate your block, which sometimes results in movement that you didn't intend.

165
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:58,000
You need to have another control scheme in, or patch in another control scheme then, because that just sounds like it'd be...

166
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
And like, Peggle is so beautiful on iPhone.

167
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Yeah, there's other games that work out great on iPhone, don't get me wrong.

168
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,000
But Luminous is not one of them, and it's all about a design flaw.

169
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Like, it's to the point where I'm seriously looking at it going, did anyone actually play this game to see if it was any fun?

170
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Or was it something that was just kind of like conceived, and hey, iPhone gaming's really big, let's just kind of put it out there and see what happens.

171
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:29,000
So, if you are a fan of Luminous, avoid, avoid, avoid, until they get this control scheme fixed.

172
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:37,000
You know, I don't care if they put this shitty touch control thing in as an option, but what they need to do is have it so you can turn drops off,

173
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:44,000
or that there's a specific little button in the right-hand corner or something where my thumb could rest that would drop the thing.

174
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:49,000
And that's the only way you would drop it. That would make it so much better.

175
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
I agree.

176
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
So...

177
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
From how you're describing it at any rate.

178
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Yeah.

179
00:08:54,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Alright, so we want to cover some news stories tonight for you guys, because even though it's only Tuesday, there's been a lot that's happened this week in gaming.

180
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:06,000
You know, with the close of the Tokyo Game Show and so forth, there's quite a bit of stuff going on.

181
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Dark Soccer has been browsing the MMO world, and has found quite a bit going on apparently in the land of MMOs.

182
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Yeah, for the people looking forward to Star Trek Online, namely me, if you get the Season 3 Blu-Ray that's going to be coming out,

183
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:37,000
then you will be actually receiving an Admiral's Outfit for Star Trek Online.

184
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:43,000
So, I can't think of a lot of, like, buy-the-movie-get-something-in-a-game tie-ins going on.

185
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:48,000
I'm sure there's been something else before that I'm just not thinking of, like, maybe with some of those Disney games they do and stuff,

186
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:54,000
but that's, especially with an MMO, I can't think of a time where it's been buy a Blu-Ray, get an item in an MMO.

187
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Which is kind of interesting.

188
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:00,000
I really think that they're trying to push the game, I mean, especially with using Champions to do it and all that,

189
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:10,000
but yeah, it looks like they're really trying to get the fans of the series into the MMO even if they're not necessarily gamers.

190
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Which is smart, but the problem is, like, as weird as it sounds, I am kind of a bit of a Trekkie,

191
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:22,000
but I don't really have an interest in those Blu-Rays, the original series Blu-Rays, right?

192
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Because, like, original series Season 3? Although, wait, no, there was no third series.

193
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Yeah, there was.

194
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Was there a third season?

195
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
I thought there were only two, but whatever.

196
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:36,000
I'm sure there, yeah, because third season is when you really started noticing the toupee.

197
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:42,000
I'm not really into the original series anyway, as much of a Trekkie as I am, it was all about,

198
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:49,000
yeah, I mean, I get that, but it was all about the, it was all about Next Generation and Voyager and DSpace 9.

199
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
It's all about DS9.

200
00:10:51,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Yeah, so, I guess that's kind of cool, though, I mean, a little bonus perk tie-in, but sorry, I'm not going to spend, like, $80 on a Blu-Ray box set season just to get some, one dumb little item.

201
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Hopefully it'll be unlockable some other ways.

202
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Maybe. I mean, then again, it's like, the admirals, all they do is sit in a chair and be important.

203
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,000
The captain's seat is what everyone joins Starfleet for.

204
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:19,000
You know, to sort of paraphrase a DS9 episode.

205
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,000
I'm still very, very curious about Star Trek Online.

206
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:28,000
I'm a little jealous of those that went to PAX and got to get a little sneak peek of it, because I definitely am curious where this game is headed.

207
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,000
There's a lot of great MMOs on the horizon.

208
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:36,000
You know, Final Fantasy XIV, I'm sorry, hate on XI all you want, but XIV looks amazing.

209
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
I'm really interested in where this game goes.

210
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Granted, you know, by the time I play it, a lot could change, but the trailer looked pretty cool.

211
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Even WoW's next expansion looks really good.

212
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Well, there's also some news about Final Fantasy XI since you brought it up.

213
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
People are still playing Final Fantasy XI?

214
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Yeah.

215
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Wow.

216
00:11:54,000 --> 00:12:06,000
There's, in October, there's going to be a new expansion titled a Shantotto Ascension that's supposed to...

217
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Well, actually they say that the next free version update is going to be in November.

218
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:17,000
But other than that, we're looking for October for the expansion pack.

219
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:26,000
It will have the new Wings of the Goddess Nation quest, the Moblin Maze Monger's dungeon crawling system.

220
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:38,000
And it's also the final part in a series of stories that was written by the guy who wrote the story for Chrono Trigger, Masato Kato.

221
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:45,000
So, that is going to stick out for a lot of people. If it was written by the guy who did Chrono Trigger, there's going to be fanboys that are like, huh? What?

222
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Well, the trilogy of the stories, I'm trying to pull up that information.

223
00:12:51,000 --> 00:13:13,000
But seriously, I don't think that it's really supposed to be all of that, because there was the Crystalline Prophecy was the first one, and then there was the Mughal Kupo Detat, the Evil in Small Doses.

224
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Oh, I remember hearing about these. These were the very small mini expansions they released.

225
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Yeah.

226
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Like online only that you would get for the game. I guess they pretty much stopped with the in-store ones, which makes sense.

227
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:30,000
If they have 14 on the horizon, development for 11 is probably going to slow up significantly and remain things like this.

228
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Yeah, I agree.

229
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Which is very interesting. What happens to a game like Final Fantasy XI when Final Fantasy XIV comes out?

230
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:40,000
It's probably going to go the way of PSO.

231
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:47,000
But you look at EverQuest and EverQuest II, I think there's more people still playing the original EverQuest. It's going to be interesting.

232
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:54,000
But I think that doesn't always happen, though. Then again, there are still a bunch of people playing Diablo II.

233
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Yeah, we haven't had a lot of MMOs get sequels yet, you know what I mean?

234
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Yeah.

235
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
And Diablo III's still not out.

236
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Well, the Ragnarok one was still going on, and a lot of people were still preferring the 2D over the 3D.

237
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Oh, that's right. I totally forgot about Ragnarok II.

238
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Yeah.

239
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Hmm. I wonder if that... So that finally came out at some point?

240
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,000
I don't know. I stopped paying attention to it, honestly.

241
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Nice.

242
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,000
I haven't touched Ragnarok in like a month, so...

243
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,000
A whole month?

244
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:28,000
I couldn't really get back into it. I sort of was going through the same thing that I went through with World of Warcraft.

245
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,000
What am I doing with my time?

246
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:35,000
So you went back to Sims instead.

247
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,000
This is actually the first time I've opened Sims in two weeks.

248
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
I'm just giving you a hard time.

249
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Except to remodel a character.

250
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
But there's something about a game that you like, Rob.

251
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
What's that?

252
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Aion.

253
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Aion? You know what's funny? I never did end up buying the full game, because I heard about all the problems they were having.

254
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:55,000
So, you know, I don't need to be the very first person in an MMO.

255
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,000
I want to give Aion a few months to let the dust settle.

256
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Because it's been having a lot of issues.

257
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Well, this is actually more news for our European listeners, anyway.

258
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,000
They're opening two European servers.

259
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:13,000
One is a French language server called Deltres, and an English server called Carun.

260
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:22,000
It's supposed to be available for character transfers from the different servers in a couple of months.

261
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
They haven't said exactly.

262
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:29,000
But it's on its way.

263
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:34,000
They say that everything should...

264
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Well, they kind of needed it, because they were having a lot of problems when it launched in Europe.

265
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
The servers were backing up like crazy, too.

266
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:48,000
That's what it was saying, is that there was way too much of a backlog on the servers and slowing everything down.

267
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:53,000
So that's why they've opened the other two, and they're going to have it where you can move your characters.

268
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:57,000
But that's... that's... something.

269
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Hmm. Alright.

270
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Well, I've got some other news for you guys that doesn't have to do with MMOs.

271
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,000
There's actually been a few things that have happened over the past couple days.

272
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:13,000
The Wii got a system update. It has a brand new 4.2 release software, and you might be asking,

273
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Oh, what cool new feature do I get with this?

274
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
And the answer is nothing.

275
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,000
At least there's nothing that they're touting that is big about this release.

276
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Apparently, the Wii system update 4.2 really only did some things behind the scenes,

277
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:30,000
and it's also supposed to improve performance of the system, whatever that means.

278
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:35,000
I don't know what exactly was broken that they needed to fix, but they're saying that's what they did in this.

279
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Also, what you probably want to know, it patches out the homebrew channel at least for, you know,

280
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
the next couple days until they figure it out.

281
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Exactly. So it shuts out the homebrew channel once again.

282
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:50,000
So if you are a homebrew Wii person, you might want to avoid that update for a little bit.

283
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:54,000
But everybody's little blue light was a-glowing this week.

284
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Also, big, big, and confirmed this week.

285
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
There were some rumors about this, and we talked about it on the show,

286
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:03,000
but Super Street Fighter 4 was confirmed earlier this week.

287
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:08,000
It apparently was revealed by GameSpot, has released the first details on the game.

288
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:12,000
T-Hawk and DJ are coming back in the game.

289
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:16,000
And there's also going to be a brand new female character named Juri

290
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,000
that is coming back to Street Fighter 4, Super Street Fighter 4.

291
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Oh, wait, is this spelled J-U-R-I?

292
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Yeah.

293
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:31,000
It could also be one of the alpha characters. Remember, Judy and Junie?

294
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:36,000
I'll be honest, I didn't play much of the alpha series, which is why I'm reading that like it's news to me.

295
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Sadly, no, I don't know. There's a little trailer here that might show more information.

296
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
I'll play a little bit of the trailer here.

297
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:49,000
But I did want to say it's not just these three characters.

298
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,000
There's going to be five more, eight new characters in Super Street Fighter 4.

299
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
When?

300
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Yeah, so let's see here. There's a little back and forth going on there.

301
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:06,000
I love the graphic style in this. It's so gorgeous.

302
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Nah, it doesn't look like that.

303
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Yeah, it looks like just another Ken versus Ryu little epic battle.

304
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:15,000
I don't know if it's really going to show any new people.

305
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Ken looks this odd.

306
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Boy, what if this is what the fighting actually looked like in the game?

307
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
That'd be awesome.

308
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,000
It's the same freaking font and everything.

309
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
For Super?

310
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Yeah.

311
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
That's kind of cool.

312
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Of course you know I noticed the font.

313
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
I know. You nerd.

314
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:36,000
So yeah, there's going to be eight new characters, three of them probably familiar.

315
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Now, what's also interesting, this game is coming out in the spring in an already crowded 2010.

316
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,000
It's coming out on the PlayStation 3 and the Xbox 360.

317
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:49,000
You will not be able to do cross-game matches between the original Street Fighter 4 and Super

318
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:52,000
because they are also doing some character balancing.

319
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:56,000
They're going to address some of the concerns that people had about the original characters in the game.

320
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,000
And of course, you know, there's eight new characters.

321
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Apparently though, Capcom will not charge full price for the title.

322
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
I'm not sure what that means.

323
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:10,000
I'm assuming that means it's probably going to be in the realm of about $40 for this as opposed to a full $60 game.

324
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Another thing to consider, did they say that it was going to be hard copy or did they say it's going to be a download?

325
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,000
I believe this is an all new release that's coming out.

326
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
It's not some type of download expansion.

327
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
I think we'll get some answers to that in the next few days.

328
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,000
But it certainly, I think it would be too big for a download, I think.

329
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Eight new characters and all this character balancing.

330
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
That's big.

331
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
So I'm pretty sure it's going to be.

332
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Does this mean that they're going to make Seth less of an ass?

333
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Hopefully.

334
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:40,000
I mean, even the guys that made the game said he's way too powerful.

335
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
I remember that coming up on a previous episode of the show.

336
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
It was fun.

337
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Alright, one other story I've got for you guys about Squeenix.

338
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:54,000
And Squeenix, apparently earlier this week, of course that's my lovely name for Square Enix, which now is Square Enix Eidos.

339
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
All that stuff in there.

340
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:59,000
So what would they be? Squeenodos. Squeendos.

341
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:03,000
That sounds like a flu that will be going around next year. We'll see.

342
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Anyhow, they are obviously a huge company with a lot of role playing games.

343
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Some of their biggest franchises, of course, Dragon Quest, Kingdom Hearts, Final Fantasy.

344
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Well, they have come out and said in a recent interview with Rooters that they want to have eight flagship IPs that will be capable of selling two million units.

345
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:33,000
If each one of these games has a two year development cycle for a new game in the franchise, then that means every quarter they could release a two million selling game.

346
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:38,000
And you could certainly see that happening with series like Final Fantasy, Dragon Quest, Kingdom Hearts.

347
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,000
But the question is, where the hell are the other games going to come from?

348
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Star Ocean?

349
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Is that a two million selling title every time?

350
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:49,000
The Tales games?

351
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Well, one thought is that perhaps because they also just recently got Eidos as a part of this as well, Eidos made Batman Arkham Asylum, let's not forget.

352
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:05,000
So the Batman series, which as weird as it is to say that Square Enix would have Batman, that could be a possible kind of IP for them.

353
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Batman and Kingdom Hearts!

354
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Oh, God.

355
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,000
I don't know if that's possible, but that would be interesting.

356
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Shut up, Sora. I'm Batman.

357
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,000
What? I'm Batman. Are you one of the heartless?

358
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
I'm Batman!

359
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Batman!

360
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:28,000
You almost, you know what you remind me of there is Eddie Murphy from 80s Saturday Night Live.

361
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:32,000
My name is Gumby. I'm Gumby Dammit.

362
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
That's old school.

363
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
That's very old school. That's older than most of our listeners.

364
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
That's older than most schools.

365
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
That joke right there. That's right.

366
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:42,000
So, alright, well Jamie wants to tell you guys about one other thing.

367
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:46,000
This is actually in regards to Left 4 Dead.

368
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:54,000
The Crash Course is actually out on Steam in the Xbox Live Marketplace, and there's actually a price point on it.

369
00:21:54,000 --> 00:22:01,000
It actually was released at a higher price point, but ended up being an error.

370
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:13,000
It is actually going to be out for, well, is out, I should say, for 560 Microsoft points right now, but it is, like I said, an error.

371
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:21,000
So if you think it's worth the money to spend a little bit more on it, go for it, but just keep in mind it is going to be dropped.

372
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:30,000
And, of course, if you have it on PC, then the Crash Course actually isn't really available from Steam yet.

373
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:35,000
It's supposed to, you know, bridge the gap between the death toll and No Mercy.

374
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:40,000
That is very strange that it wouldn't even be on Valve's own service yet. On Steam.

375
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
I'm sure it's just a little hold up.

376
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
It just says that the download content is not available yet.

377
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
Soon. Soon.

378
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,000
Maybe.

379
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:53,000
Alright, well we're going to get into a little segment we do here on Orange Launch Radio called Twitter Topics because...

380
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
Because we can.

381
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
Because we can. Basically that's what it boils down to.

382
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:01,000
We're bored and don't really know what else to talk about here on the show tonight because it's only been a couple days since our last show.

383
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:04,000
We go to Twitter and we say, hey guys, what do you guys want us to talk about tonight?

384
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:09,000
Because, you know, it's where every gamer has a voice and, sadly, we can't do calls tonight because we're not actually live.

385
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:14,000
There's another show going on on All Games right now, so we couldn't, you know, we don't have our own radio station anymore.

386
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
We can't just bust down the door and say, hey guys, we're live.

387
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:20,000
We could just go, hey, chat room, someone call us.

388
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:26,000
I guess we could go bust down the door on All Games, but I don't think the VGO fans would appreciate that.

389
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,000
Well, no, no, no. They can call our line.

390
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
We only have a couple of people on chat right now.

391
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:35,000
Well, I've been soliciting questions from chat, so we got plenty and plenty of questions from you.

392
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
By all means, Mr. Rob Korski.

393
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:40,000
Tweets and chatters and all this stuff.

394
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
Blue Swim is our first tweeter tonight.

395
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
We got a lot of tweet questions.

396
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,000
We got more, we got like twice as many as we usually do on a Sunday.

397
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,000
Really?

398
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
Maybe we need to move our show to Tuesday nights.

399
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,000
No.

400
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,000
Yeah, I know, I agree.

401
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:58,000
Blue Swim on the Twitter asks, what do you guys think of the natural disaster survival genre?

402
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:05,000
Twister the game with a flying cow and digital Helen Hunt tits equals epic win.

403
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
You know what, though?

404
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:11,000
If Loki were here, he would diss that game that Konami was showing at E3, which was something like that.

405
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
It was like a natural disaster game.

406
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
And there was one of those on Xbox Live not that long ago, too.

407
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:19,000
And neither one of those games was exactly as awesome as you would think.

408
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:22,000
And neither one had digital Helen Hunt tits, either.

409
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:32,000
The closest I've ever played that had natural disasters in it that I could stand was the tornado area in Sonic the Hedgehog on Dreamcast.

410
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
Because that was pretty freaking cool.

411
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:37,000
Other than that, suck!

412
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:41,000
Blue Swim goes on to say in a second tweet, after playing the PlayStation 2 game Raw Danger,

413
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:46,000
I'm convinced that the disaster genre has huge amounts of untapped potential.

414
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,000
I have to be honest.

415
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,000
Let's leave that untapped, please.

416
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
That's not a game I've ever played.

417
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
Is that something newer?

418
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
This is PlayStation 2.

419
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
I have no idea.

420
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:01,000
Gamer Girl on the Twitter asks, what was the first game anyone's ever played?

421
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
Ooh, that's tough.

422
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:06,000
I gotta go way back.

423
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
There's two.

424
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:12,000
The earliest memories, because, you know, I don't remember, unfortunately, far enough back.

425
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,000
You know, it's hard, because when you're that young, you don't remember everything.

426
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:18,000
But I would say I kind of have a memory of two games.

427
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:22,000
One of them would be Spider-Man on the Atari 2600.

428
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:25,000
It was one of the first games I ever remember playing.

429
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:28,000
And at the arcade, Crystal Castles.

430
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:32,000
I remember going to my sister's wedding reception.

431
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:37,000
And they had it, like, I don't want to say she had her wedding reception at Chuck E. Cheese,

432
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:40,000
but there was some type of, like, I think it was like a rehearsal party.

433
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,000
That's what it was. It was like a post-wedding rehearsal party.

434
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:46,000
I was, like, three, so I barely remember this.

435
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:50,000
But there was some type of, like, wedding rehearsal post-party, and it was at Chuck E. Cheese.

436
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:53,000
And I remember playing Crystal Castles, and I thought that game was the shit.

437
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:59,000
I remember being four and playing Pong on an arcade machine.

438
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:03,000
I grew up playing pinball, really.

439
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:10,000
As far as early memories, like, I remember being six

440
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:15,000
and going to play the Odyssey 2 at my friend's house next door.

441
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:19,000
And playing Casey Munchkin and Casey Crazychase.

442
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:27,000
And we also, you know, I had a Cliccovision when I was a kid.

443
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:31,000
I remember playing Atari a lot earlier, Atari 2600 a lot earlier,

444
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:37,000
because I remember playing Pitfall.

445
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
Who enabled your gaming addiction?

446
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:43,000
Because it doesn't sound like your mom was really that much into video games,

447
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:46,000
but yet you had all these systems that I never heard of.

448
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:50,000
My mom actually was kind of into games, you know.

449
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:56,000
Because keep in mind, when I was four, my mom was still in her early 20s.

450
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:00,000
You know, most of my childhood was spent with my mom in her 20s.

451
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:04,000
And so she liked to go out and have fun and liked games and played some pinball.

452
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:08,000
And when we'd go get pizza, she'd give me a few quarters

453
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:14,000
and leave me in the little game area so I could play the Mario one or play a kangaroo.

454
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:18,000
Kangaroo was, I was the shit at kangaroo.

455
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:23,000
I mean, over Godfather's Pizza back in the day in Mobile.

456
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,000
Wow.

457
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:28,000
And I've been a gamer practically since, you know,

458
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:34,000
I knew that turn this knob, the bar moves this way, you know.

459
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:37,000
Yeah, I have very early memories of Atari 2600 in much the same way.

460
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:40,000
I don't remember who got one for the family or how we got it,

461
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:44,000
but we had an Atari 2600 and my dad hooked it up so that, you know.

462
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
But it was hooked up in my mom's room, which I always thought was weird,

463
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:50,000
but I think that was so that if my dad wanted to watch TV

464
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
or somebody wanted to watch like a real show,

465
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:56,000
then I wouldn't be monopolizing the big television with video games.

466
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
I would always have to kind of like go in my mom's room to play,

467
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
and then she'd get mad if I don't ask first.

468
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:08,000
I also played a lot of Apple II games, like a lot of Kix, Load Runner.

469
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:13,000
I also grew up on the Carmen Sandiego games.

470
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
Yes, I played those too.

471
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
Oregon Trail.

472
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:21,000
Our family got a Commodore 64, Christmas 1983.

473
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:25,000
I remember that, that was a big, that would have been five at the time.

474
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
And that was like our first computer.

475
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:31,000
And honestly, between Atari 2600 and Nintendo Entertainment System,

476
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
that was my gaming platform.

477
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:36,000
When I was in second grade, we got our Cliccovision,

478
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:39,000
and we had the driving wheel and everything, and we set that up.

479
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:42,000
There's actually still pictures in one of my mom's photo albums

480
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:47,000
of me sitting on the floor playing mousetrap.

481
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:59,000
And her stupid ex-husband, Craphead, playing, he was really good at Carnival.

482
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
Oh, the little, is that the one where the clowns bounce up and down

483
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
and pop the balloons?

484
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:07,000
Yeah, it's this little glass thing shooting game.

485
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
Oh, no, I know.

486
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
Okay, I know what game you're talking about.

487
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,000
It's like an old ass shooting game.

488
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
Adventure was my game.

489
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
It was freaking hard too.

490
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:19,000
And what else did we have?

491
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
Gorf.

492
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,000
We had a stack of games.

493
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:27,000
I think that I have, we actually have my Cliccovision.

494
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:32,000
We got another one since then, but we actually have just my core Cliccovision.

495
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:37,000
And I might be permitted to part, I might be convinced to part with it.

496
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,000
What a trip down memory lane.

497
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,000
Thank you very much for the question, gamer girl.

498
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
It's in the vault somewhere.

499
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
I would love to hook up the old ass systems

500
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:46,000
and see how long some of those games can hold our attention today.

501
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:49,000
There's the point of actually having a TV that will run some of them.

502
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:52,000
Keep in mind, my Odyssey 2, we don't have a TV it works on.

503
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:58,000
Um, they take the RF, it's all RF, or the old coaxial cable thing, right?

504
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,000
The little hooky things.

505
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
That go with the coaxial cable, right?

506
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,000
Like hooking up cable.

507
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:05,000
Mmm, ye.

508
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,000
Right? Isn't that what they use?

509
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,000
No, no, no.

510
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,000
Really?

511
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:11,000
This had the little scoop things that you screwed into the back of your TV.

512
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

513
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,000
The antenna.

514
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,000
Yeah, that's what I'm talking about.

515
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:17,000
Oh, I thought you were talking about the cable type coax.

516
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
No, no, it's uh...

517
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
Yeah, that screws into the little converter box.

518
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,000
Yep, yep, yep.

519
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,000
The switch, the RF switch, yeah.

520
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,000
So those, um...

521
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
My Nintendo had one of those.

522
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:29,000
You know, those TVs are going to actually be really easy to find now

523
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
because a lot of them, because of the whole digital TV transition,

524
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,000
They're obsolete.

525
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,000
They're obsolete.

526
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,000
So what else are they good for but playing...

527
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,000
Thrift store!

528
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,000
Yeah, seriously.

529
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
Anyhow, let's move on with some other questions.

530
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,000
That was a lot.

531
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
Takeo Ray wanted to plug his Extra Life donation page.

532
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
The URL is very long.

533
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
I'll go ahead and read it here because obviously Extra Life

534
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
was something we wanted to be involved with.

535
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
Unfortunately, we had to back out as shared on the last show,

536
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:52,000
which sucks, but we are still supporting the cause, certainly.

537
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:57,000
Takeo Ray's page is at waystogive.texaschildrens.org

538
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:02,000
slash netcommunity slash Allen, A-L-L-E-N, Ray, R-E-Y.

539
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,000
That's all one word.

540
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
A-L-L-E-N, R-E-Y.

541
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
I do want to say, though, if you just want to check out

542
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,000
what Extra Life's all about in general,

543
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:11,000
I'm sure Takeo Ray would not mind if you just donate

544
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
to somebody that's participating,

545
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:16,000
extralife.sarcasticgamer.com.

546
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:19,000
Sarcastic Gamer, of course, being another podcast.

547
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
I've never listened to it,

548
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000
so I couldn't tell you what they're about.

549
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,000
That's not a slam on that show.

550
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
I don't listen to pretty much any other podcast,

551
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:30,000
but Bobby, because he's on before us,

552
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
that's just because I want to make sure

553
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:35,000
we don't inadvertently copy somebody else.

554
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
I would hate for that to happen.

555
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,000
Exactly.

556
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:41,000
But I'm sure they're sarcastic.

557
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,000
It is in the title.

558
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:45,000
No.

559
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
I don't know how to pronounce this name,

560
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,000
but I'll try.

561
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:51,000
Sponchtwang, S-P-O-N-C-H-T-W-A-N-G.

562
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,000
Sponchtwang?

563
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,000
Close enough.

564
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
What do you guys think about Konami rolling out

565
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
the official DDR tourney?

566
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,000
You know, Konami announced...

567
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,000
What?

568
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:02,000
They are doing an official DDR tournament

569
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
that is going to be in certain cities across the US,

570
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:09,000
and it all kind of comes to a head at an official Vegas tournament.

571
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
But in order to go to the one in Vegas,

572
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
you have to win one of the satellite competitions that's happening.

573
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,000
Qualifiers.

574
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,000
Yeah, basically.

575
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
I don't think there is one happening in NorCal.

576
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
I think the closest one is in the LA area.

577
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:23,000
That's a shame, because a bunch of the really good...

578
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,000
I may be wrong. Please don't quote me on that.

579
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
I don't have the site up in front of me, but yeah.

580
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
I think a lot of the...

581
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
I mean, this comes from watching a lot of videos

582
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
and seeing a lot of people.

583
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
But really, do you think that some of the best players

584
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
were in the Bay Area?

585
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:40,000
I think it's good that Konami is finally doing this.

586
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:43,000
I think they're honestly, sadly, about five years too late.

587
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
I think this is something they should have done

588
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
when Extreme was out, but fair enough.

589
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
They're trying to promote some of their new DDR games.

590
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
I think the one mistake they're making...

591
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:54,000
They didn't give a lot of notice before this tournament happened.

592
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
It was literally like,

593
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:59,000
hey, this is going to start in Texas next week.

594
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
It really came out of nowhere,

595
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
and I think that's probably one of the biggest mistakes they made.

596
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
Whereas if they just would have given it a little time,

597
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
like maybe a month to build...

598
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
And maybe they did have it out,

599
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
and I just didn't hear about it until a week before,

600
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
but I don't think there was a lot of notice,

601
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
because I want to say the first thing I read on DDRFreak

602
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
said it was like, this weekend.

603
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:21,000
But I think if they'd given it a little more time to breathe,

604
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
let the media cover it a little bit.

605
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,000
Let some of the blogs...

606
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
Because here's the thing, none of the blogs,

607
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
the big, big blogs have said anything about it,

608
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
which is unfortunate, because, you know,

609
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
you would hope that something like this

610
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
would gain a little more notoriety and steam.

611
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
This should be a huge tournament.

612
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
This should be the size of the tournament

613
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
at the end of The Wizard, the movie.

614
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:44,000
Super Mario 3.

615
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
It's so bad.

616
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:49,000
Von Johnson on Twitter wants to know,

617
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
what do you guys think about Borderlands?

618
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
You know, I don't know much about this game,

619
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
but I did a little bit of research,

620
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
just because of your Twitter question.

621
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:00,000
It's a person shooter, but it also has RPG elements mixed in.

622
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:03,000
It's being made by Gearbox, and 2K is publishing it,

623
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
and it's coming out on PC, of course.

624
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:08,000
PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, it's coming out in October.

625
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
They want to make a franchise out of it,

626
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
and honestly, when I'm first looking at this,

627
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
just the box art and even some of the screenshots,

628
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:17,000
I'm kind of like, they're kind of going for the Fallout audience.

629
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:20,000
This looks a lot like kind of what Fallout is all about.

630
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
If I want a Fallout game, I'll play Fallout.

631
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
But, you know, it's certainly...

632
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
And then I'll throw up, because I get motion sick.

633
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:29,000
You should know, it does do random level generation.

634
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
It's kind of got something like Diablo.

635
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
They're kind of saying it was like that.

636
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
So, you know, certainly this has its own merits,

637
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
so things like that.

638
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:40,000
A content creation system, which will influence some of the weapons

639
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:43,000
that you see in game and the game world and the map.

640
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:46,000
So it sounds like this is something that's going to kind of develop

641
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
uniquely for each person.

642
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
That sounds kind of cool, especially for an RPG.

643
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
That's a little weird.

644
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
Weren't some of the dungeons in Fantasy Star,

645
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
the earlier Fantasy Star games?

646
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
Mmm, that might be true. I think you might be right.

647
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,000
Random generated?

648
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
I think it's a nod back to some of the old RPGs,

649
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:04,000
but even so, if it's a first person shooter,

650
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
I'm not going to be into it.

651
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
I also do want to point out, though, it has player versus player in it,

652
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:11,000
which is certainly a huge element that I don't believe Fallout has.

653
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:15,000
You can actually melee another player to issue a challenge,

654
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
and then there'll be a one-on-one duel.

655
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:21,000
You go to arenas and competitively play with other people.

656
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
Fight to the death.

657
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:26,000
This certainly sounds like kind of an original game,

658
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:29,000
even though we're making jokes that it sounds a lot like Fallout.

659
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
It definitely sounds like it has some unique features

660
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
that try to make it set it apart.

661
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
So hopefully they release a demo.

662
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
That would be my biggest thing.

663
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
I probably still wouldn't try it out.

664
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
Well, you have the whole motion sick thing going on.

665
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,000
You just don't play first person shooters in general.

666
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:47,000
I don't play a lot, but there are a few that I got really into,

667
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,000
but most of them are old.

668
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:51,000
And then they're going to be anytime soon, as long as Dan's got ODST.

669
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
Quake, Duke Nukem, 3D.

670
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
Those are the games I'm talking about that I got into.

671
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,000
I haven't gotten into a shooter.

672
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,000
I played a little bit of Halo.

673
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:00,000
The last one I played any severe amount of was Hexen.

674
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:03,000
Now that is an old school shooting game.

675
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:06,000
I wish there would be a game like that again.

676
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:09,000
Like the whole magical, mystical first person shooter type of thing.

677
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,000
That was a rad game.

678
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,000
Hexen was great.

679
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
Just the whole problem being, you know,

680
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:17,000
that was still sprite based and, you know.

681
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:21,000
Wasn't Heretic 2 the one that they did?

682
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,000
They moved to 3D?

683
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:25,000
Yes.

684
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:29,000
Doctor of War C, or Doctor of Work on Twitter,

685
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,000
who has a cute little chibi squirtle icon,

686
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:34,000
wants to know the last CD or song you bought.

687
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
I said anything goes.

688
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
Last CD or song you bought.

689
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:42,000
Um... physical CD?

690
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:45,000
Oh god, I can't even remember the last physical CD I bought.

691
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,000
That was too long ago.

692
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,000
I can tell you the last... go ahead.

693
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,000
The World's Greatest Mashups Part 2.

694
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,000
Really?

695
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,000
Yes.

696
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,000
Nice.

697
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:59,000
As far as an actual song, I bought actually what my cage match pick was.

698
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,000
Which didn't win, I'm sorry to tell you.

699
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:04,000
Loki picked some song out of thin air and we both lost by one vote.

700
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,000
He pulled it out of his ass.

701
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,000
He did. He always does.

702
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
But it was all the Kylie stuff.

703
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,000
Yeah.

704
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:12,000
I would say the last song I bought, funny enough,

705
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,000
there's a story behind this.

706
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:16,000
The last song I bought was Limbo Rock by Chubby Checker.

707
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
Yes, that's right.

708
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
No joke. Go back.

709
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
It's in my iTunes receipt.

710
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:26,000
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo.

711
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
I wish I had it on this computer. I'd play it.

712
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
But it was actually, it was for Rocky.

713
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:34,000
I bought it because there was a new little pre-show game we did

714
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
that was the Limbo, so I had to get the song for that.

715
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,000
But that's the last song I bought.

716
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,000
What was your last physical CD?

717
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
I don't remember the last physical CD.

718
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:43,000
The last iTunes CD I bought was Ellipse by Image and Heap.

719
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,000
I know that.

720
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
But as far as CD I actually...

721
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:52,000
Oh, so the last download CD that I got was Regina Spector.

722
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:57,000
I actually think the last physical CD I bought was

723
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:00,000
Flavors of Entanglement by Alanis Morissette,

724
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
and that came out like a year ago.

725
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,000
I just don't really buy physical CDs.

726
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
Now that I think about it, I'm pretty sure that it wasn't,

727
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:08,000
the mashups disc was the last one that I bought.

728
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
But I'll be damned if I can remember what it is.

729
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
I know what it was, Video Games Live.

730
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,000
Oh.

731
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
I bought it at...

732
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,000
There you go.

733
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,000
At the concert.

734
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,000
There you go.

735
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:22,000
And that's a great place to get physical CDs,

736
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:25,000
is at concerts, because sometimes you can get them to sign them there.

737
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,000
SimsLovah wants to know,

738
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:30,000
what games are you excited about for next month?

739
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
I'm still catching up on last month.

740
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
I haven't been able to play crap.

741
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
You were out because of your hand.

742
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:39,000
Yep. I am still kind of out on my hand.

743
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,000
You never even played Marvel Ultimate Alliance, did you?

744
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,000
No. In fact, look. Right here.

745
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,000
Look at this.

746
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
Oh my god, a sealed copy.

747
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:50,000
And I really freaking want to play it so I can get my Deadpool on.

748
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,000
Poor thing.

749
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:54,000
I think my team is going to be Deadpool and

750
00:38:54,000 --> 00:39:01,000
Ms. Marvel and Phoenix and Captain America.

751
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,000
I never played Ultimate Alliance 1.

752
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,000
So when you finally crack that open, I need to come over and play it with you.

753
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:08,000
Yes you do, because I'm going to need you to help me pass the levels

754
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:11,000
and get me achievements and whatnot.

755
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,000
Look, Deadpool.

756
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
What if I suck at it? I've never played it.

757
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
Trust me, there's no real way to suck at this game.

758
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,000
It's just butt mashing?

759
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,000
It's mashing.

760
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,000
Alright, fine.

761
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:23,000
Really, in looking at the releases, DJ Hero clearly is a game I want to get.

762
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,000
Also, kind of slipping under the radar,

763
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,000
there's a lot of big releases between Gran Turismo, PSP,

764
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:30,000
Uncharted 2 certainly is going to be worth a look.

765
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:33,000
But I do want to point out Demon's Souls is coming out on the PlayStation 3.

766
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,000
That was a game I checked out at E3.

767
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,000
I think it's been out in Japan for a little while,

768
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,000
but they're adapting it over here.

769
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
It's like an RPG, but it's supposed to be super hard.

770
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:43,000
And especially with White Knight Chronicles getting pushed back to next year,

771
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
I think I do want to pick up Demon's Souls and check it out.

772
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:50,000
That's actually a PlayStation 3 exclusive, if I remember correct.

773
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
Nutman wants to know in chat.

774
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,000
Yes, that's the name.

775
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,000
I'm sorry, not chat.

776
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,000
That's Twitter again.

777
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:59,000
For Rob, a question just for me.

778
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,000
Would you go straight for Alicia Keys?

779
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,000
Be honest.

780
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:07,000
No, I have to say no.

781
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,000
Not for Alicia Keys.

782
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:14,000
And I could get into this whole tirade about I don't really believe there is

783
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:17,000
going straight in quotes or going gay.

784
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:21,000
There is just liking who you want to like, as I call it.

785
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:27,000
I go ahead and classify myself gay because I like guys, mostly.

786
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:33,000
But I'm not going to say I would never, ever, ever, ever, ever want to kiss a girl.

787
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:36,000
You have a witness in this room.

788
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:40,000
But Alicia Keys I don't think would be the one, that's for sure.

789
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:44,000
Anyhow, I'll save the sexuality tangent for another day.

790
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:47,000
I don't think people signed up for this podcast to hear that talk.

791
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
I don't think she's that cute.

792
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:52,000
Petrek85 wants to know, um, duh, guh.

793
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,000
That's exactly what they put.

794
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,000
Um, duh, guh.

795
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
What's your favorite colors?

796
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,000
New game smell.

797
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,000
Ooh, new game smell.

798
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,000
She unwrapped.

799
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,000
Favorite color?

800
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,000
Black.

801
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:04,000
Like my soul!

802
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
Uh, dark forest green.

803
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
I'm actually really fond of dark, dark red.

804
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:14,000
There's actually an in-joke amongst a lot of my friends that I always wear earth colors.

805
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:20,000
Like, I pretty much always am wearing brown, green, black, you know, like earthy colors.

806
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,000
You're not today.

807
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,000
Funny enough, today I'm wearing all blue.

808
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:26,000
I have a, like, little blue stripey shirt and blue jeans on today.

809
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
I'm wearing gray.

810
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
Even down to my warm fuzzy socks.

811
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
It's like the weather today, but the weather today is gray.

812
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,000
Are you feeling okay?

813
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:37,000
I just grabbed something comfortable to paint in because I have my class today.

814
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,000
Nice.

815
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:43,000
I have to, I tend to wear my older clothes on Tuesdays and Thursdays because I know that

816
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:46,000
I'm just gonna go get paint all over them, which amazingly enough I didn't get any paint

817
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
on myself today.

818
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,000
Uh-

819
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,000
Acrylic is a bitch to wash out.

820
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:54,000
I got one more question on the Twitter that just came in a little bit ago while we've

821
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
been taping, and I'll give this one more reload before we sign off tonight.

822
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,000
This is fun.

823
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,000
I like this for a random show when there's not a lot of news.

824
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:00,000
Um, okay.

825
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,000
Soda or pop?

826
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:02,000
Asks spazinator.

827
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
PSN on Twitter.

828
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:05,000
I, soda.

829
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,000
Easy.

830
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
I hate, I hate pop.

831
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
I hate it when people call it pop.

832
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,000
Like, it just bugs me.

833
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,000
It's like nails on a chalkboard.

834
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
Pop is what you do to bubble gum.

835
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:17,000
Pop is what you do to bubbles when somebody blows them.

836
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,000
Technically-

837
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,000
Pop goes the weasel.

838
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:20,000
The name is soda pop.

839
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,000
I get that, but it just sounds weird.

840
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:25,000
But, this is where I start giving the cultural lesson on growing up in Alabama.

841
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,000
Mm-hmm.

842
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:31,000
Because my little, especially my part of Alabama had Coca-Cola bottling company plant.

843
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:39,000
So every drink, every soda in, and yes, I do prefer soda, every soda in the South is

844
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,000
called Coke.

845
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,000
It doesn't matter.

846
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,000
It's all Coke.

847
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:46,000
And I'm okay with that even, even though I prefer Pepsi.

848
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
Pepsi is so much better because Coke tastes like poo.

849
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:54,000
But, but now though, when I go into a restaurant and it throws people off so much.

850
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,000
Let's see.

851
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,000
Um, you know, can I get you a drink?

852
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,000
I'd like a Diet Cola.

853
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:00,000
Ah, Cola.

854
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
That's one you don't hear a lot.

855
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:06,000
Because I don't like, I don't really care for the Sprite type drinks, you know.

856
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:10,000
But I'll say I would like a Diet Cola, whichever one you have.

857
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:13,000
So that way they won't do, is Coke okay?

858
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:14,000
Is Pepsi okay?

859
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
I just said whichever one.

860
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
I don't care.

861
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:21,000
You know, there's a, you know, they have to do that though, because plenty of people bitch

862
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:22,000
about it when it's not the right one.

863
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:27,000
But, but I, that's why I specify and you've heard me do it.

864
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:30,000
I will take a Diet Cola, whichever one you have.

865
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
That's a blanket permission.

866
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:38,000
If you don't have Coke or Pepsi, but you have RC Cola, by all means, give me the RC.

867
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:43,000
Which by the way, I was going to say, when I hear the word Cola, I think of RC Cola and

868
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:47,000
I think of Shasta Cola, which I don't even think they probably sell outside of Merkle.

869
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:50,000
Do you remember Faggo?

870
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:51,000
Root beer.

871
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,000
That would be, what about just saying root beer?

872
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:54,000
Here's the thing though.

873
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:58,000
Honestly, Spasinator, if I was smarter, I wouldn't order soda at all.

874
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:01,000
Honestly, soda's not really that good for you.

875
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:04,000
You really shouldn't have more than one a day.

876
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:08,000
So just kind of throwing that out there, because I know that with the whole video game stereotype,

877
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
there's people that chug Mountain Dew's.

878
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:14,000
So if you know you're the type of person that chugs Mountain Dew's, and then you're like,

879
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
when did my butt get so big?

880
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
Then it's probably because you're chugging Mountain Dew's.

881
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
So not to slam on Mountain Dew.

882
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,000
I love those drinks as much as anyone else.

883
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,000
But seriously, look how many calories are in one of those.

884
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:29,000
There's as much calories in one of those drinks as there is in a candy bar.

885
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:35,000
Rob, I have to give up my diet soda and my coffee and black tea.

886
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,000
Oh my gosh, you poor thing.

887
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:38,000
I can have green tea.

888
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,000
Can you have Sprite?

889
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:43,000
What's the point? Caffeine.

890
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:47,000
The only type of caffeinated drink I'm supposed to have is green tea.

891
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,000
I'm like, the hell with that. I'm having coffee.

892
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:53,000
But I'll have my one cup of coffee in the morning. One.

893
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:56,000
We got a few good questions from our chat room, actually.

894
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:57,000
Who cares? Bye.

895
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:00,000
Shut up. I was talking with a few of the chatters before the show,

896
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
and actually we got some really good questions from chat.

897
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:05,000
Three of them came from the Rob D, but these are all good discussion questions.

898
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:08,000
Rob D's just a smart and articulate guy, anyway.

899
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:11,000
I really enjoy when he calls into the show. He's a smart guy,

900
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:14,000
and obviously I've gotten to hang out with him a couple times.

901
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:15,000
Penny Arcade Expo.

902
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:16,000
We had really good Chinese food.

903
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,000
And Asen. I got to see him again.

904
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:21,000
So he's a good guy. I wish his show would come back.

905
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:26,000
That was a slick show, this day in gaming that he had.

906
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,000
I was trying to remember what it stood for.

907
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
This day in gaming that he had, it was a slick show.

908
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:34,000
He has a really good voice for radio, and the guy that edited it did a really good job.

909
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:38,000
Anyhow, Rob D asks in chat, first thing he said,

910
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:42,000
what is your favorite Japanese media depiction of an American?

911
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
That's a good question.

912
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:48,000
Mine is and will forever be Terry Bogard.

913
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:51,000
I don't know. This is one I'd really have to give some thought to.

914
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,000
I can't think of any big stereotypes that jump out at me.

915
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:59,000
I would have to say from Axis Powers Hetalia, America,

916
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:02,000
who is always sitting in the corner eating cheeseburgers

917
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:06,000
and giving emphatic orders.

918
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,000
I'm going to take the question in a different direction here.

919
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:11,000
It's not my favorite Japanese media depiction of an American,

920
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:16,000
but my favorite British depiction of an American was Bubbles from Absolutely Fabulous.

921
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:19,000
I'm sure none of our listeners are going to get that reference,

922
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:24,000
but that was my favorite depiction of an American.

923
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:28,000
The only thing that's coming to mind, and it's not even her depicting an American,

924
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:34,000
it's her depicting a Welsh.

925
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:40,000
It's Dawn French doing her imitation of Catherine Zeta Jones,

926
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:44,000
but slipping into a fully California American axis.

927
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:47,000
She says, oh, my California's showing.

928
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,000
Nice.

929
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:52,000
I have to do it right.

930
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,000
Catherine Zeta Douglas.

931
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,000
I lost it.

932
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,000
Is this something people can look up on YouTube or something?

933
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,000
Catherine Zeta Douglas Spartacus Jones.

934
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:01,000
Spartacus Jones?

935
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:02,000
Yes.

936
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:03,000
Nice.

937
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:07,000
Just look up Dawn French or French and Saunders and Catherine Zeta Jones.

938
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:09,000
It's hilarious.

939
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,000
Especially the roundabout one.

940
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:12,000
That one's funny.

941
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:15,000
Here's another good question from our articulate friend.

942
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:20,000
Overall, do you think the internet gaming community has helped or stunted the gaming industry?

943
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:24,000
I see the zeitgeist that has sprung up from the sites and forums we have today,

944
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,000
and honestly, it makes me sad.

945
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:32,000
Everyone complains about everything, and that drives sales down because of social pressure.

946
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:41,000
I think it's a necessary evil, and I know that's totally like I just picked none of the above in a way,

947
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:46,000
which is sad, but the problem is that it's not just the gaming industry that I think has to deal with this.

948
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:50,000
The movie industry, to a certain extent, definitely has to deal with this big time.

949
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:55,000
Sites like Ain'tItCoolNews.com or everybody's got a movie blog, it seems these days,

950
00:47:55,000 --> 00:48:02,000
and bitchy people like Perez Hilton and some of these gossip blogs will oftentimes ruin a movie

951
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:06,000
before it comes out with spoilers and things that it stinks.

952
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:07,000
Think about it.

953
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:11,000
I know most of us, even I'm too young to remember this,

954
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:19,000
but when The Empire Strikes Back originally came out, or no, Return of the Jedi originally came out,

955
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:22,000
and it was revealed that Darth Vader was Luke's father.

956
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,000
That was Empire Strikes Back.

957
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:25,000
Sorry, leading into Return of the Jedi.

958
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:27,000
I remember this.

959
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:30,000
That was such a huge fucking thing.

960
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:34,000
Like, oh my gosh, what a shock, what a surprise.

961
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,000
That would not be possible in this day and age.

962
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:37,000
Think about it.

963
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:41,000
A huge reveal like that would have been spoiled on the internet a month before the movie was released.

964
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,000
Snape killed Dumbledore.

965
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:44,000
Exactly.

966
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:47,000
It was on T-shirts by the time the book came out.

967
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,000
Snape kills Dumbledore, page 200 and something something.

968
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:52,000
And sorry if that was truly a spoiler to you, but seriously, how long has it been on you?

969
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:57,000
If you haven't read it by now, there's got to be some type of moratorium on spoilers.

970
00:48:57,000 --> 00:49:01,000
Like, if it's been out for two years and you still haven't done it, you're going to get spoiled.

971
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:06,000
Well, that's why I did very well to hide myself.

972
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:12,000
I mean, even though I figured out that something like that was going to happen from the freaking beginning of the damn book,

973
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:19,000
hi, especially when the last book came out.

974
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:27,000
I hid myself in a hole and made sure to read everything that day before I let myself read anything on the internet.

975
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:33,000
But it's interesting because even though you know that, and even if I just spoiled that for you,

976
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:39,000
which I'm sure I wasn't the first person to do so, that's not going to ruin what was a good book.

977
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:45,000
Just like knowing that Darth Vader is Luke's father is not going to ruin that movie.

978
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:49,000
It's still a good movie and really good stuff will hold up amongst all the spoilers.

979
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,000
But I'm digressing a little bit. I apologize.

980
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:55,000
I'm just kind of trying to say this isn't really something that's specific to the gaming industry, in my opinion.

981
00:49:55,000 --> 00:50:05,000
This is internet culture and live performances, television, every artistic foray,

982
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:08,000
which yes, gaming is one. We can have that discussion another day if you want.

983
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:15,000
It is subject to this scrutiny that is the blogosphere that we live in now.

984
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,000
It's just the way it is.

985
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:22,000
I think companies to overcome that kind of have to be smart in how they do things.

986
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,000
But it's really hard to keep a secret.

987
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:30,000
Look at what happened to Sony and having everything spoiled, except Final Fantasy XIV was one of the only secrets they had.

988
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:33,000
Most of their big things were spoiled.

989
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:37,000
And now you had this whole Sega Sony thing we talked about on the show last week.

990
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,000
That was a huge spoiler thing, too.

991
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,000
It's very hard to keep a secret anymore.

992
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:44,000
But if the product is really, really good, it's going to transcend all that.

993
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,000
Yeah, I totally agree with that.

994
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:51,000
Because how many people who had their Harry Potter spoilers still went out and got the book?

995
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:55,000
So going back to the original question, because we totally digressed from the question and probably missed the point.

996
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:59,000
Has the gaming community helped or stunted the gaming industry?

997
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:01,000
In the end, it doesn't matter.

998
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:03,000
It's not a switch we can turn off.

999
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:08,000
But I would honestly say the answer is a little of column A and a little of column B.

1000
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:13,000
It's probably made things better as far as promoting.

1001
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:24,000
I think games like Scribblenauts, Braid, some of these games, I don't think would have sold as well or been quite as talked about if it weren't for the internet.

1002
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:29,000
I think the concepts of some of these games wouldn't have even existed if not for the internet.

1003
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:35,000
Scribblenauts itself has so many internet jokes in it. Hi!

1004
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,000
But has it hurt things? Sure.

1005
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:39,000
Has it hurt sales of some games? Sure.

1006
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:44,000
But honestly, I don't even know if that's the blog so much as it is probably just piracy.

1007
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:47,000
Straight up piracy is easy to do, you know?

1008
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:49,000
Anyhow, that's a good question.

1009
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:51,000
Want to do one more from the Rob D?

1010
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:52,000
Sure.

1011
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:55,000
Along the same lines, has online multiplayer helped or hurt gaming?

1012
00:51:55,000 --> 00:52:00,000
Before, a good game could have glitches and they would be ignored or even revered.

1013
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:06,000
Now people will complain that it needs a patch because it will be abused if there's an online component.

1014
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:11,000
I think it's just a sign of the times. I mean, I really think that it's just the evolution.

1015
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:16,000
You know, you move in one direction, you're going to have problems that come because of it, you know?

1016
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:19,000
I really think that you can't have one without the other.

1017
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:22,000
So I don't really see it as a hurt or help.

1018
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:28,000
I'm going to plant myself firmly in the column of I believe multiplayer gaming has helped gaming altogether.

1019
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:32,000
I think it's created genres of gaming that really wouldn't exist otherwise.

1020
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,000
I think it hurt arcades.

1021
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:38,000
I think multiplayer gaming and the online stuff, I think it hurt arcades.

1022
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,000
And I think that's what finally put the nail in the coffin of arcades.

1023
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,000
I think it hurt people's social life.

1024
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:45,000
But I think it helped gaming in general.

1025
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:48,000
I mean, let's face it. What is the Xbox 360's biggest strength?

1026
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:49,000
Online.

1027
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:53,000
Online is online. And what is a lot of people, you know, what made it so successful,

1028
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:56,000
especially in the beginning over the PlayStation 3,

1029
00:52:56,000 --> 00:53:03,000
complain all you will about how Sony maybe botched the launch of the PlayStation 3 that they're trying to make amends for now.

1030
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:07,000
But the online component has always been Xbox 360's greatest strength.

1031
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:11,000
What is the one thing most of us are most critical about with the Wii?

1032
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:12,000
The lack of online.

1033
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:16,000
The lack of online and the lack of ability to patch games and the lack of, you know,

1034
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:20,000
we kind of see that as not catering to the hardcore audience.

1035
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:25,000
They said, though, from the get-go that it's not for the hardcore audience.

1036
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:30,000
But honestly, I've kind of made friends with online games, as strange as that sounds.

1037
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:31,000
I know, I have.

1038
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:36,000
Yeah, I mean, I've met people on, like, LiveJournal that I'll go off and, you know,

1039
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:41,000
join my guild in Final Fantasy XI or World of Warcraft or what have you that I've become really good friends with.

1040
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:47,000
Well, just along the same token, a lot of the people that I've made friends with out here,

1041
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:52,000
they were my online buddies in Alabama, you know, through playing Gemstone.

1042
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:53,000
Oh, wow.

1043
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:54,000
How's that for old school?

1044
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:55,000
That is very old school.

1045
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:59,000
Or, you know, doing the silly little games on AOL, you know.

1046
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:01,000
Nice.

1047
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:07,000
I met a lot of people who are now my in-person friends, but I met them online.

1048
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:09,000
You know, Dan.

1049
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:10,000
Your husband you met online.

1050
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:11,000
My husband, I met online.

1051
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:17,000
So, I think that while this may have hurt face-to-face social interaction,

1052
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:24,000
I think that it has opened the doors for people who otherwise would not get out of the house, you know.

1053
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:27,000
I'm trying to think if I want to open this little Pandora's box here,

1054
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:32,000
but let me kind of take a step away from gaming for a minute and this whole, like, internet social thing.

1055
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:35,000
As a gay man, the internet's been huge.

1056
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:42,000
Because I think especially, like, you know, where it's not something you can just...

1057
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:47,000
It's sometimes kind of hard to meet other gay people because not everybody kind of is, like, out with it

1058
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,000
and a lot of people have to suppress it out there in society.

1059
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:51,000
I think the internet's helped a lot of people connect.

1060
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:53,000
And I don't think that's necessarily limited to gay culture.

1061
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:58,000
That goes for a lot of, like, fans of anything.

1062
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,000
Or lifestyle...

1063
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:03,000
Well, a lot of fringe groups too, you know.

1064
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:06,000
People who may think, oh, I'm the only one, I'm the only one.

1065
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:10,000
You find out there's other people like you, you know.

1066
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:20,000
I think it's fantastic for, especially not just as a social tool, but as a socially informative tool, you know what I mean?

1067
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:24,000
So in a way, what Jamie and I are saying right here kind of goes back to answer this question.

1068
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:29,000
Because gaming would be another type of community where you're able to find people like you,

1069
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:32,000
you know, that are into the same types of games that you are.

1070
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,000
You know, kind of combining them both.

1071
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:39,000
One of the most, one of my favorite websites, the most awesome communities I've been to is gaygamer.net.

1072
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:45,000
You know, because I'm able to meet, like, other gay geeks like myself, which is ironic because I actually don't go there a whole lot anymore.

1073
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:48,000
But I went to, like, a party they had once and I had a lot of fun.

1074
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:54,000
And it was kind of cool because, you know, sometimes in gamer culture, I feel like the underdog for being gay

1075
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:57,000
and you sign on Xbox Live, fag, fag, fag, you know, you hear all that stuff.

1076
00:55:57,000 --> 00:56:01,000
And then as the gay guy, I sometimes feel like being a nerd, I'm on the bottom rung.

1077
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:06,000
Because I'm not a fashionista. I don't, you know, go to every Madonna concert and all this stuff.

1078
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:07,000
You know what I mean?

1079
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:08,000
I know what you mean.

1080
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:12,000
That's why I rolled my eyes because I see way too much of it, you know.

1081
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:17,000
Don't cry for me, Argentina. This happens in any social structure, not just the ones I've mentioned.

1082
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:21,000
But I think the internet has allowed us to find people like us and gaming is a part of that.

1083
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:25,000
Think about it. What about the community we have here at Orange Lounge Radio?

1084
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:28,000
We've met a lot of awesome people just because they've listened to our show.

1085
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:31,000
She's an example directly through a game.

1086
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:36,000
One of my friends that I played on the IRO back in the day, on the International Ragnarok Server,

1087
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:40,000
she's, we haven't met, you know, she lives in Canada, so we haven't met face to face.

1088
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:41,000
I've never been up there.

1089
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:47,000
But we're still friends on DeviantArt and through LiveJournal, you know, we still keep in touch.

1090
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:51,000
And I'm talking, you know, seven years ago.

1091
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:58,000
So I've made, even though, you know, these are people that I would never have come into contact with,

1092
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:07,000
people of vast talent, like, you know, for example, I met Tiara online.

1093
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:12,000
You know, we were friends online before we'd ever gotten to meet in person.

1094
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:19,000
And, you know, now, you know, we hang out whenever we can go to each other's towns or go to Disneyland.

1095
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:21,000
But it's pretty cool, you know.

1096
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:29,000
I've made really lasting friendships through, you know, online networking and through, you know, games.

1097
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:32,000
So, meh.

1098
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,000
One more question tonight.

1099
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:36,000
That was a good discussion.

1100
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,000
This one comes from Dark Tetsuya.

1101
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:44,000
And the question is, how likely are you guys to be checking out La Mulana when it hits WiiWare when it's available?

1102
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:48,000
I did read the difficulty, at least of the controls, has been adjusted.

1103
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:51,000
I really wish there were demos, but that's a whole bigger issue.

1104
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:55,000
I still have some extra Wii points from a gift card someone was kind enough to give me for my birthday,

1105
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:57,000
so I'll probably use it to pick up this game.

1106
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:59,000
Because I do love kind of the retro gamey goodness.

1107
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:04,000
And what I've seen of La Mulana, I've actually watched Dark Tetsuya play a little bit of it on his channel.

1108
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:07,000
It looks fun, so I'll check it out. Why not?

1109
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:11,000
It has to be better than that BitBoy game I can't believe I actually spent points on.

1110
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:14,000
I'm still thinking about it.

1111
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:21,000
Just right now, me playing much of anything is in small doses that I have to be able to take a lot of rest with.

1112
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:24,000
Why isn't there a Nintendo magazine that comes with demos?

1113
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:27,000
You know, they do this on the Xbox. They do this on the PlayStation.

1114
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:33,000
Granted, those discs got made a little obsolete in this era of gaming because we all download our demos online.

1115
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:36,000
But remember on PlayStation 1, those demo discs used to be the shit.

1116
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,000
I have a pile of them.

1117
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:39,000
They're awesome.

1118
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:44,000
Why doesn't Nintendo do something like that to make up for the lack of having an online thing?

1119
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:46,000
I don't get that.

1120
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:50,000
Wouldn't that be cool if they had a magazine that would have like five games you could play on a disc?

1121
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:52,000
They're too busy kissing Miyamoto's ass.

1122
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:56,000
Or kissing Soccer Mom's ass or something. I don't know.

1123
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:59,000
Let me just reload the Twitter real quick to see if we got any other last questions.

1124
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:00,000
No, we didn't.

1125
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,000
Jeremy keeps trying to get out of the room and then she's like,

1126
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,000
Ah, the door!

1127
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,000
And then turning back around.

1128
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:09,000
I think we're going to go ahead and wrap up. We've been taping for about an hour now.

1129
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:11,000
Are we going to wrap it up in ribbons and bows?

1130
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:13,000
Yes, we are. We're going to sign, seal, and deliver it.

1131
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:16,000
But this is fun. This is a good little chat. Those are really good questions, guys.

1132
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:17,000
So, thank you.

1133
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:21,000
It's nice to know that when we need to, we can pull a show out of our butt just by saying,

1134
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:23,000
Hey guys, ask us questions.

1135
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:25,000
And that's all the community right there.

1136
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:27,000
You know what this means?

1137
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:35,000
To sort of tease a little bit an idea that I brought up to you on Sunday about a little one hour thing involving a room in my house.

1138
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:37,000
That would make it entirely possible.

1139
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:42,000
It would. There could be plenty of good, fun things in store for us in 2010. We'll see.

1140
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:44,000
So, thanks to everybody for the questions.

1141
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:47,000
If I somehow missed your questions, I'm sorry, we'll roll it over to another show.

1142
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:50,000
Don't forget, you can always send us an email. Mailbag at OrangeLaunchRadio.com.

1143
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:56,000
And thank you guys so much for tuning into our show tonight, even though we weren't live or downloading it, even though it was a little different tonight.

1144
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:58,000
I hope you guys have a great week.

1145
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:03,000
We'll be back to do our normal show one week from Sunday, which would be October.

1146
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:08,000
We need to bring back our missing houseguest, the ferret.

1147
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,000
Oh, the ferret.

1148
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:11,000
To join the ranks of the-

1149
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:14,000
Do you miss the ferret more than Loki? Is that what you're trying to say?

1150
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:18,000
No. No. No. No. Yes. No.

1151
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:22,000
October 11th, we'll be live again at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, on All Games Radio.

1153
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:26,000
Any final thoughts tonight, DarkSakura?

1154
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:29,000
I'm hungry.

1155
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:32,000
I haven't talked about food all day.

1156
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:35,000
That's how you know it's in a typical episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

1157
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:42,000
My final thought is, by the time you're hearing this, I will be on Space Mountain Ghost Galaxy. Heart.

1158
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:46,000
So, that's it. We're done. We're out of here.

1159
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:50,000
Oh, let's go to San Francisco so we can wait for the tsunami.

1160
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:53,000
The tsunami is not hitting the West Coast, didn't you hear?

1161
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:59,000
Alright. We're out. Bye, guys. See you next week. October 11th, we'll be back live.
