Orange Lounge Radio

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:13,000
With your hosts, Dark Sakura, Sky, and Roto!

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Tonight, October 18th, 2009, playing early bootlegs get you banned from Xbox,

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
the PSP series gains heavy product placement tie-ins,

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
and the classic arcade racer returns in high dev.

00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Orange Lounge Radio

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Well hello everybody and welcome to another edition of Orange Lounge Radio.

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
We are that radio talk show dedicated to video games,

9
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
My name is Rob Roberts and I'm here with you every week,

11
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
as well as the one and only Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.

12
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
How you doing?

13
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
That good, huh?

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Will you actually be speaking tonight or just communicating in grunts?

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Alright, fine.

16
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Also say hello to the hopefully better spoken tonight, Loki.

17
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Hello.

18
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
How you doing, Techmaster Loki?

19
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I'm doing fine.

20
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Awesome.

21
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
A little bit before the show tonight, just before we went live,

22
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
sadly Bobby wasn't on tonight, but you know,

23
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Bobby Blackwolf needs a break too once in a while and he had other stuff going on.

24
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
But we were live on the feed a little early tonight,

25
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
and Loki was playing some more DJ Hero.

26
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Yes I was.

27
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
So we got to hear, and you have the full version now.

28
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Yes I do.

29
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
We got to hear some of the mixes,

30
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
so I'm kind of curious what our chat thought of what they got to hear.

31
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Sadly, you know, we can't reproduce it for the podcast

32
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
because of copyright and all that,

33
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
but we were playing the, what was that?

34
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
It was Eric Pride's Tears for Fears.

35
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Oh yeah, Eric Pride's Piano versus Tears for Fears Shout,

36
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
and then of course MC Hammer with Can't Touch This and...

37
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Vanilla Ice, right?

38
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Vanilla Ice Ice Ice Baby.

39
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Which was sounding really epic in the beginning, but got a little...

40
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
It's not one of the better tracks on there,

41
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
so there's a lot of good tracks in there, I mean,

42
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
and we'll get into that later, but it's...

43
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I'm not disappointed at all.

44
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Well we'll get into that in just a minute,

45
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I know Loki wants to talk about that during his gaming week,

46
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,000
but first I need to plug our lovely bandwidth hosts,

47
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,000
the one and only www.allgames.com, All Games Radio,

48
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
always helps us out by letting us steal their bandwidth every Sunday night,

49
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
and they are the home to a bunch of great programs,

50
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
not just Bobby who's usually on before us when he's not, you know, in a drumline,

51
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
but then as well as a host of other programs

52
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
such as Escapist Listening Lounge, Video Game Outsiders,

53
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Electric Sisterhood, Dead Pixel Live, blah blah blah,

54
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
the list goes on and on, it's great.

55
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
All Games Radio, www.allgames.com.

56
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
We tape live Sunday nights at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern,

57
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
and if you've never listened to Orange Launch Radio live before,

58
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
well, why not? Sad.

59
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
You should come join us some Sunday,

60
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,000
and if you are hearing this on a Sunday night that happens to be October 18th,

61
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
then we actually are live, and you are tuned into All Games Radio,

62
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
and you know that we're going to start off the show, as we always do,

63
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
with a little bit of How Is Your Gaming Week.

64
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
DarkSakura, what types of video games have you been playing this week?

65
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Mmm.

66
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
You do have to speak at some point during this radio show.

67
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Okay.

68
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I'm fine.

69
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I play Peggle.

70
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
And how is Peggle?

71
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Pegglerific.

72
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Yeah?

73
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Um, I downloaded a bunch of crap for Sims,

74
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
and now it's making my game kind of fart while it's loading.

75
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Sorry to hear it.

76
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Yeah, I accidentally started installing a bunch of cute clothes,

77
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
and then I found out after I was already installing them

78
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
that they were for Sims 2,

79
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
and me being a lazy-ass just didn't bother

80
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
because I figured the game just wouldn't recognize it.

81
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
So, I've been reading a lot of comics.

82
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
What type of comics?

83
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Um, I will pull...

84
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Oh, look, my game decides to start working now.

85
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I'm going to build a house live on air.

86
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Deadpool 900, including the epic story of Deadpool vs. Mimes.

87
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
We have Deadpool vs. Mimes?

88
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Yes, look at the cover.

89
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
That's not a very fair fight, if you ask me.

90
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
They're mimes that are powered with psychological weapons

91
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
that their mymery actually causes real damage.

92
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Their mymery?

93
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Their mymery.

94
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Mimicry.

95
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
No mymery. I like the word mymery.

96
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Knock that miming off.

97
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I've had to play with...

98
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
You know...

99
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
I've had to play with your audio a little bit, by the way.

100
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
If you are hearing Dark Soccer kind of fade in and out,

101
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
it's live radio. That kind of thing happens.

102
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
We adjust audio on the fly sometimes.

103
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Because remember, though...

104
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
What?

105
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
A mime is a wonderful thing to waste.

106
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Shut up.

107
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Hey, wait. I have an idea for a new segment, though, Dark Sakura.

108
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
What?

109
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
We're gonna do a segment called

110
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Dark Sakura Reviews Games Through Grunting.

111
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
You ready?

112
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
What game should I review?

113
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I'm gonna name some games and you review them with a grunt.

114
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Okay.

115
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
We'll start with something easy.

116
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Sims 3.

117
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Marvel Ultimate Alliance.

118
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Yaris.

119
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
DJ Hero.

120
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Alright.

121
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Speaking of which, I don't know if there's anything else.

122
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Loki, do you have anything you want Dark Sakura to review with a grunt?

123
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
No.

124
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Alright.

125
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
I can't think of anything else.

126
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
There's Shadow Complex.

127
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Okay, Shadow Complex.

128
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Bayonetta.

129
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Alright.

130
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Cheater. That's not even out yet.

131
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Alright.

132
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
It's pretty, though.

133
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
She's wearing her hair.

134
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Loki, how was your gaming week?

135
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
It was good.

136
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Played lots of Grand Theft Auto, Lost and Damned.

137
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
There's been rumors going out there, and I've seen it now,

138
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
that people have found a way around the patch so they can re-enable mods again.

139
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
And I've been trying to figure out how to do that.

140
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:28,000
And I'm close, but what I thought I needed to change actually freezes the game up.

141
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:33,000
So, not quite there yet, but I'm on the path to getting it done.

142
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,000
And I've obviously been playing lots of DJ Hero.

143
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,000
I played it for a few hours today and yesterday.

144
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Most of the game starts off locked when most of the tracks you can play.

145
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
So I've actually unlocked almost everything in the game so far.

146
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I mean, that's how much I've been playing it.

147
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,000
And if you played it at, say, a Best Buy or GameStop or something like that

148
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,000
and thought it was too easy, trust me, those songs are nothing

149
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
compared to the stuff that's in the game.

150
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
It's fucking hard even on medium.

151
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
That's what I've been playing it on.

152
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
I mean, you bump it up to Expert or something like that.

153
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
It's just insane.

154
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
So I wouldn't be worried by that.

155
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
But yeah, nothing like BeatMania, obviously.

156
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
But great track lists.

157
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I mean, there's not really any songs I haven't liked in the game.

158
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
I mean, there's some that have been okay, but there's none that I really hate.

159
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I mean, it's just overall good.

160
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
I like playing all of them.

161
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
And for the live folks, you're going to spin some more songs.

162
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Oh yeah, we'll play more songs during the break.

163
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Awesome.

164
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Anything else, or is this DJ Hero or DG Hero all week long?

165
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
That's what I've been doing.

166
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
All right, sounds good.

167
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
My Gaming Week.

168
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Sadly, I don't have a lot of new games, really.

169
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
There's only one new game I can think of to review,

170
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
and it's actually something I've been playing a couple weeks.

171
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
I just have yet to mention it on the show.

172
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,000
It's a PlayStation Network game, and it's called Digger.

173
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,000
And I guess it's based off an old Apple IIe game or something.

174
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
I had never played the original game.

175
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,000
It's kind of like if Dig Dug met Mr. Doom,

176
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:07,000
met Pac-Man, met a lot of other classic 80s games,

177
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
kind of all in one little hodgepodge of a game.

178
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
You can play the game in classic mode,

179
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:15,000
which is why I can kind of tell that this game was either originally on Apple II

180
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
or the old school CGA,

181
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,000
because that's the kind of graphics it has, the CGA graphics in classic mode.

182
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
But you don't download games on PlayStation Network

183
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
to play them in four colors now, do you?

184
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Obviously, the game's been fleshed out with a whole new high def mode,

185
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
and pretty crisp graphics.

186
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:33,000
So if you're into retro gaming, I think you'll kind of like this,

187
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
especially because it combines the elements of all these old games.

188
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,000
I like a lot of the retro games, though.

189
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
It can get a little repetitive, so be warned.

190
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
But they do try to throw in some things to make it interesting,

191
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,000
like co-op survival and co-op collaborative mode,

192
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
and a whole crap ton of levels.

193
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,000
My only complaint is that it was hard for me to kind of pick up and go with the game.

194
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,000
There's no tutorial or mode that teaches you how to play the game.

195
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
I guess they figure a lot of people are going to want to download this

196
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
because of the retro vibe going on,

197
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
but that's a lot harder to do with a game like Digger

198
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
than, say, a game like Pac-Man.

199
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
I don't know, because everybody fucking knows Pac-Man.

200
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,000
I had never heard of Digger until I decided to download this game,

201
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
and I was like, oh, retro gaming classic, maybe I'll like it.

202
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Unfortunately, there's no demo out there for it, so I took a risk.

203
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,000
But not bad. I'm not depressed with the money I spent,

204
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,000
but I don't think it's a wow, OMG, run out and buy it right now type game either.

205
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
I think if you like the old retro classics,

206
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,000
you like your 80s PC games, you'll get a kick out of this.

207
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
But maybe you'll find out faster than I did

208
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
that there's actually a fire button,

209
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
and you can actually shoot the oncoming enemies

210
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
that makes the game a little easier when you feel a little overwhelmed,

211
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
because I had no idea.

212
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,000
There's no tutorial or nothing to kind of get you going with the game.

213
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
So that's my one little piece of feedback for it.

214
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Otherwise, OMG, World of Warcraft, LOL, WTFBBQ.

215
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
I was looking for donations, by the way.

216
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Are you?

217
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Yeah.

218
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Everybody's looking for donations on the show.

219
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Well, no, I mean, because I can't.

220
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
I know, I know.

221
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:07,000
But I am up to level 52 on my paladin.

222
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
I just hit 52 before the show tonight,

223
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,000
which isn't bad considering I think she rolled on September 3rd or 4th,

224
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
so I haven't been playing that long,

225
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
and I don't have triple XP or anything like that,

226
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
so I'm happy.

227
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
So that's it for my gaming week pretty much.

228
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Otherwise, the same type of stuff I already talked about last week,

229
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
like Demon's Souls and Katamari Forever and all that fun stuff.

230
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
So now that we've talked about our gaming weeks,

231
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
let's get into some housekeeping real quick,

232
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
but actually not a lot for that segment either.

233
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:39,000
So I'm just going to plug our Twitter at www.Twitter.com slash O-L-R,

234
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
and of course we also have our Facebook community.

235
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Just search for O-L Army.

236
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
By the way, we're going to create an actual page on there too.

237
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
I can't remember if I mentioned this last week or not.

238
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
I was going to work on that more this week,

239
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
but I got sidetracked leveling a paladin,

240
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
so I'm hopefully going to get that done.

241
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Actually, we had a lot of shows that we were behind on the feed too.

242
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Three shows went up this week on the podcast feed,

243
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
so you can't say I didn't do anything for O-L-R.

244
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
I got that just about caught up.

245
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
And yeah, so look for that on Facebook,

246
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
and we have a MySpace if anyone actually uses that anymore.

247
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Does anyone use MySpace anymore? I don't think so.

248
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:18,000
The last thing I did on MySpace was look at my art history teacher's blog.

249
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
The last thing I did on MySpace was block spammers.

250
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Nellie looked at MySpace the other day and she's like,

251
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
wow, it looks like Facebook now.

252
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,000
They did change some stuff on there to try and make it more Facebook-y, I guess,

253
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
but I don't like it anymore.

254
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Facebook did something that makes me happy.

255
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
What's that?

256
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,000
I can now block everything I don't freaking want to see.

257
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,000
I can keep from getting this stupid sorority life invites.

258
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
They've had that for months.

259
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,000
But they haven't had it in an easy-to-access place.

260
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
You had to go into your profile and everything,

261
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,000
and I would set it all up through my profile and I'd still get all the shit.

262
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Because the apps get smart and they work around them.

263
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,000
They exploit every little thing Facebook will let you do.

264
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Now I can just hide and I don't ever have to see it again.

265
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Yay.

266
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
All right, that's what Twitter needs, by the way.

267
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
O-M-G, does Twitter need a hide button?

268
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Twitter needs a filter.

269
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,000
All right. Anyhow, let's move on.

270
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Let's talk less ranting on social networking and more gaming news.

271
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
We'll start off tonight.

272
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
The wonderful Loki is going to start us off tonight.

273
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Yes, Nintendo has partnered up with Capcom

274
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,000
and 53 other video game publishers in Japan

275
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:23,000
to file suit against four resellers of the popular R4 flash cartridge.

276
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,000
You know, the one that modded the pirate stuff.

277
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Apparently, though, in Tokyo court it banned the sale of the devices.

278
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:37,000
However, these four retailers are kind of ignoring that.

279
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:42,000
So there's a new lawsuit now that finally stopped these guys from selling it.

280
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,000
I mean, it's kind of interesting if you think about it

281
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:51,000
because they've been making threats about this stuff for a while now.

282
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
And I kind of find it funny that they're really only targeting the R4

283
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
because that is the most widely known backup device.

284
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
But there's tons of them out there.

285
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:05,000
I mean, the R4, I don't even think it's being used as much nowadays

286
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
as some of these other ones.

287
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
I don't know.

288
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
But I guess it's a start

289
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,000
because I know piracy really eats into the DS sales.

290
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Especially overseas, right?

291
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
They have more of a problem with this overseas than they do here, right?

292
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Definitely.

293
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Are you surprised by this move?

294
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:26,000
I mean, I can't think of anything quite like this that I've heard of recently.

295
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Well, it makes sense.

296
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:31,000
I mean, the court already banned the sales of this stuff.

297
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
They went ahead and ignored the law.

298
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,000
I guess they're going to have a lawsuit put against them.

299
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
I don't know.

300
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
It's not surprising, I guess.

301
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Yeah.

302
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Okay.

303
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Do you think there's a legitimate purpose for someone having an R4

304
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
or is this just straight-up piracy?

305
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,000
I mean, is there any type of way that they could come into court and say,

306
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,000
oh, well, this R4 has a legitimate purpose

307
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,000
or is it just 100% piracy?

308
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,000
It does have a legitimate purpose as far as enabling homebrew,

309
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:05,000
but once again, though, it's kind of reverse engineering the DS

310
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:09,000
sort of to make it work, that kind of stuff.

311
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:14,000
So yeah, it might allow for homebrew stuff,

312
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:19,000
but any of the homebrew enabling patches, mods, whatever out there so far

313
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:24,000
have been pretty much stomped out by any game hardware manufacturer.

314
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,000
I mean, look at Sony with the PSP firmwares.

315
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Yeah, it enables homebrew, but people use the pirate stuff,

316
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
so they've been stomping that out.

317
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Look at the Wii, the homebrew channel.

318
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:37,000
I mean, also used for homebrew, but also used for piracy.

319
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,000
They've tried to stomp that out, and then now with the DS,

320
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:45,000
with the flash cards, they're trying, and they keep making changes to it.

321
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
It's hard, though, with the Wii.

322
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Well, I should say not even the Wii, but the DS,

323
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,000
not so much with the DSi now because I think you can patch that

324
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,000
with firmware upgrades, but with the DS,

325
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:01,000
so you can't add any firmware upgrades to it, so you're pretty much stuck.

326
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:05,000
If someone gets one of those, maybe later on some of the games

327
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,000
will patch it so that you can't play those ROMs or whatever

328
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:12,000
on your R4 device, but the ones that are already made out there,

329
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
there's nothing they can do about it because they can't patch it.

330
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
I've got a wild question for you.

331
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Isn't homebrew piracy in a way?

332
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,000
I mean, any homebrew that's cooked up,

333
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:26,000
because aren't you supposed to buy a very expensive kit from Nintendo

334
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,000
or Sony or whoever it is to develop for the system?

335
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
No.

336
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Are you supposed to buy these very expensive kits to help you develop?

337
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
If you were to put something out in market,

338
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
then maybe that wouldn't necessarily be piracy,

339
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
but it would be unauthorized,

340
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,000
because of all the stipulations that they have,

341
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
the testing process that has to go through,

342
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
and development kits and whatnot.

343
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Then, yeah, to be in market, you'd have to be an authorized developer,

344
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
but this isn't really in market.

345
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
This is just kind of crap that they're throwing on there.

346
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,000
But it encourages people to hack their stuff, right?

347
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
People are going to hack it no matter what,

348
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
whether the carts are out there or something else.

349
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
I mean, they'll find a way around it.

350
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
All right.

351
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Well, I'm going to our chat room at chat.orangelandradio.com,

352
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,000
and it looks like there's just other devices out there.

353
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Azure Edge says, I have Ace Card 2.

354
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,000
I've never heard of this, but I guess that's another similar device?

355
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Yeah, there's the Ace Card.

356
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,000
There's Cyclo DS, Evolution.

357
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:25,000
They've also got the M3.

358
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:29,000
I think the D6 or something like that.

359
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
So why are we just hearing about the R4 then?

360
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Because it's the popular one, I guess.

361
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
It's just like, you know, like Napster.

362
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Remember, there was Napster and a lot of other file-sharing services,

363
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
but everyone went after Napster because...

364
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Oh, yeah, LimeWire, Virus Heaven. I remember that one.

365
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Well, I'm just saying that there were other services out there,

366
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
but, you know, they're going to go after them.

367
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Just like Pirate Bay.

368
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,000
They're going after Pirate Bay because that's the most...

369
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,000
I guess they're making an example out of them or something like that.

370
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Yeah, but they really can't do anything about Pirate Bay

371
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,000
unless they get international law changed or...

372
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Didn't Pirate Bay have to stop?

373
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Didn't something happen with that?

374
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
I mean, I don't know. I don't use Pirate Bay.

375
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
It did, but it's still up.

376
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
So I don't really know.

377
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
I guess it didn't work very well.

378
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Going to our chat again, Tiger Claw says,

379
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Homebrew is also used to create applications that can be useful

380
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:24,000
for non-gaming purposes, like listening to internet radio and such.

381
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Hey, I guess that would be useful, wouldn't it?

382
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
For programs like this.

383
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Well, it's also the kind of, you know,

384
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:35,000
put the applications and features that you want on a certain console.

385
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:39,000
It's a way to build those in where, you know,

386
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
said company is not putting them in.

387
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:45,000
And actually some companies, like Sony, have learned from the Homebrew community

388
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,000
and have seen what they've put in there

389
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,000
and have added that support in later on.

390
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Sometimes little things kind of get endorsed, too.

391
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
I seem to remember, you know, speaking of,

392
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,000
because Tiger Claw's comment kind of made me think of internet radio on the Wii,

393
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,000
there was a program a while back, and I can't remember the name of it,

394
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
and I don't even know if it's still developed,

395
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:10,000
but it was a program that was supposed to let you get podcasts on your Wii,

396
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
like it downloaded them to some program,

397
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
or sorry, not the Wii, the Xbox 360.

398
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
You could get podcasts on the 360,

399
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
and I remember it was really controversial

400
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
because all the podcasts that were in it by default,

401
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:22,000
it was downloading like the last five episodes all at once.

402
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Maybe somebody in chat can remember the name of this.

403
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Because I remember we were listed in a future version of it

404
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
after that bug was taken out,

405
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
but the reason why I bring it up is that I seem to remember

406
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,000
like Major Nelson mentioned it on his blog or something,

407
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,000
and that's why the thing got so popular so fast,

408
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,000
and it just screwed the bandwidth of all these sites.

409
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,000
I remember Gamer Andy was pissed about it.

410
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Tiger Claw says it's TV or City,

411
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
but that's actually not the one I'm thinking of.

412
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,000
I think that lets you do podcasts also,

413
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
but that's not the same one I'm thinking of.

414
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
That's what you use for streaming video.

415
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Yeah.

416
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
But there was another program, and I can't remember the name,

417
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
but it was a couple of years ago.

418
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
I don't think it's developed anymore.

419
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,000
If it is, it's not popular, sadly.

420
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
I don't know.

421
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,000
But anyhow, maybe somebody else in chat will come up with that later.

422
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Anyhow, moving on to another new story,

423
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
something completely different.

424
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Let's talk Pokemans.

425
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
OMG Pokemans.

426
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Anyhow, no.

427
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Let me show you them.

428
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
There is a new Pokemon game coming out.

429
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,000
It is PokePark Wii, Pikachu's Big Adventure.

430
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Nintendo officially unveiled the game this week,

431
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
meaning screenshots and all that fun stuff.

432
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
It is coming out in Japan on December 5th.

433
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
It'll set you back 4,800 yen.

434
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:36,000
That would be $53 in exchange rates.

435
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Sadly, though, it's not really a Pokemon Game Boy game on the Wii,

436
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,000
like people have been wanting, oh, I don't know, forever.

437
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Instead, it's a game where you are, of course, Pikachu,

438
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
because, you know, one of the Pokemon is nearly as famous,

439
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
and you're in, like, a theme park,

440
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:57,000
and you tag, battle, and participate in quiz minigames.

441
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Oh, joy.

442
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,000
It's another minigame collection on the Nintendo Wii.

443
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Only this time, it has Pokemon.

444
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,000
But my Pokemans, let me show you them.

445
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Also, Pikachu interacts with new friends.

446
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:14,000
There's also a camera mode to let you photograph the Pokemon you meet.

447
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:18,000
I guess kind of tipping the hat to Pokemon Snap, which was kind of awesome.

448
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,000
But no words about Mudkips. Sorry, guys.

449
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
But Pokemans, Rob.

450
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:28,000
I know it's Pokemans, but it's not like the Game Boy Pokemon games.

451
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Don't care, Pokemans. It'll sell.

452
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Nintendo prints money.

453
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:36,000
I guess so, but I'm just like, yay, another minigame collection on the Wii.

454
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Although, to be fair, they're talking about, you know, tagging and battling

455
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
and all this other stuff, too.

456
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,000
And I shouldn't judge a game before I play it,

457
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,000
but, you know, you're not giving me a lot to go off of here.

458
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
It's not like the Wii has demos, either,

459
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,000
and I'm not going to spend 40 bucks or 50 bucks on a game

460
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
just to find out it's another crappy minigame collection.

461
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,000
But, but, but, Rob. Pokemans.

462
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,000
DarkTatsuya in chat says Pokemon Snap needs a sequel.

463
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:02,000
It sort of does, and maybe that's what they're trying to allude to with this,

464
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,000
but I wouldn't say that this is a sequel by any means.

465
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Now, I'm looking at screenshots,

466
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,000
and here's one where it looks like Pikachu's kind of fighting Charizard

467
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:13,000
with some timer on the screen doing battle, so I don't, maybe,

468
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
maybe there's something cool in there,

469
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:20,000
but it's not the role-playing Pokemon a lot of you guys have come to know and love,

470
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:24,000
which I think is the game people really want on the Wii. So.

471
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,000
That's, that's sad and a shame and a travesty.

472
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
It is.

473
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
It is what else is sad and a shame and a travesty.

474
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
What?

475
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
What Sega's doing.

476
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
What is Sega doing?

477
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Bringing back a piece of my tortured past.

478
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Why?

479
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Into full HD life.

480
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,000
I do not understand. Please elaborate.

481
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Um, I don't ever, if I've ever told you about my nightmares of Daytona USA.

482
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Even if you have, it's probably been years, so tell them again.

483
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:55,000
I used to, when I worked for my Namco arcade, we had a four-person Daytona USA,

484
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
and it would, it would follow me. I would hear,

485
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Daytona!

486
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Or, Rolling Start!

487
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
I don't know, like, ugh!

488
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
What about Daytona?

489
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
That too.

490
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:11,000
So, um, but it's coming back. It is coming back.

491
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Oh, is it ever, as Sega Racing Classic.

492
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Sega Racing!

493
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:24,000
And, um, it's gonna be on, uh, the ring-wide, um, arcade hardware,

494
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:32,000
and, uh, it's being called Sega Racing Classic because they don't have the rights to the Daytona name anymore.

495
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Oh, well that makes sense, I guess.

496
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:38,000
So I guess we're, we're not gonna get the Daytona.

497
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,000
So, but you know what I want?

498
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:47,000
Is I want cameos by, um, Pepsiman, and by, um, Sega Tasanchiro.

499
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,000
That would make me happy.

500
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:54,000
Sega always has the most interesting product placement in their games,

501
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
because I think about Crazy Taxi.

502
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
I also want to race as the horse in the game.

503
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,000
And, I want a little mini-game in there where you can fight,

504
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,000
make the cars fight each other like Fighter's Megamix.

505
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Uh, xlinc in chat says,

506
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
I work at an arcade and I hated that song.

507
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Yes! See, anyone who has worked in an arcade,

508
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:14,000
where the attract mode is turned sufficiently loud enough,

509
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
knows my pain.

510
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Knows my pain.

511
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,000
I'd have nightmares, I'm not kidding, I would have nightmares.

512
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,000
Nightmares.

513
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
Nice.

514
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,000
No it's not! It's awful!

515
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:31,000
How would you like to be in the middle of dreaming about,

516
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,000
you know, so-and-so gorgeous person, and then hear,

517
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,000
DAH! Oh god! Knock it off!

518
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:41,000
Maybe I don't understand because I've never played this Daytona game.

519
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
I just somehow missed it, I guess.

520
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:49,000
I left Daytona USA at the Luxor the first time I went to Las Vegas,

521
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
when it first, when the game first came out,

522
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:55,000
and had like the eight person big rallies set up.

523
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
I thought it was cool then,

524
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
that's the last time I ever thought that game was cool.

525
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
Wait, don't they have this at Dave & Buster's?

526
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Uh, they have something similar.

527
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
I think they have NASCAR, it's like similar to that.

528
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:09,000
Maybe I played it years ago when they had it at Dave & Buster's, I think.

529
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:14,000
It was one of those games that they would have linked like 80,000 units.

530
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:18,000
Rob, you just need to go on YouTube and look up Daytona Rolling Start.

531
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Sure, I'd be happy to.

532
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,000
It's fantastic radio, and this is how everyone would know-

533
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
There you go, Tiger Claw linked the theme in the chat room.

534
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
Yeah.

535
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:34,000
Dude, Tiger Claw is like faster at researching stuff than I am.

536
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
I've already been on it.

537
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,000
I'm saying that because there's like a 45 second delay.

538
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
I have played this game.

539
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000
Yes, you have.

540
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,000
Yes, I have.

541
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:55,000
Now that I'm not hearing your horrible karaoke rendition of it, I recognize it.

542
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
You need to find the Rolling Start one,

543
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:00,000
because that's the one that I still hear in my sleep.

544
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
How can you not like this song?

545
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
It's totally not repetitive.

546
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
Because I have something called taste.

547
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,000
This almost sounds like it could be like an 80s cartoon theme, you know?

548
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,000
That'd be awesome.

549
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,000
Someone should totally make that as their cell phone ringtone, that'd be awesome.

550
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:24,000
I'm gonna make that the ringtone for whenever Jamie calls on my phone.

551
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,000
Hey, I've already made a bunch of iPhone ringtones now.

552
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:34,000
I made the Burning Rangers one, and that's about as far as I'll go into the realm of Sega.

553
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
Hey, Jamie, I've got a joke for you.

554
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,000
It's gonna end...

555
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:42,000
The joke is gonna be when I kick your ass so hard your teeth will feel my foot.

556
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,000
Dark Sakura.

557
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,000
Knock knock.

558
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,000
What?

559
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,000
What?

560
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
What?

561
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,000
Shut up.

562
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
I will play it again. I will fucking play it again.

563
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
I will kick you in the face.

564
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,000
You know what your ringtone is on my phone, by the way?

565
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,000
What?

566
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
I wanna guess. Is it?

567
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,000
No? No?

568
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
Just let me borrow that phone.

569
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,000
So I gave you something more annoying.

570
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,000
Alright.

571
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:27,000
I don't know what it is with this show tonight. I'm just...

572
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,000
It's called Jamie Has a Headache.

573
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,000
I feel sorry.

574
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
Oh, and Tigerclaw linked the rolling start, by the way.

575
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,000
Awesome.

576
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:37,000
That one, actually, I do like that one okay.

577
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,000
Just cause I think it's kinda neat.

578
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
I realize this game is like years and years old.

579
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
This is the worst soundtrack in history.

580
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
I love this soundtrack. What are you talking about?

581
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:52,000
It's more of a song you need to play the game to.

582
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
I actually like this music.

583
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:07,000
Xlinc in chat says, I'll fly over there and both of them in the face.

584
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:10,000
Except he left out, like, there's a word missing there, I think.

585
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,000
So...

586
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
You know what you can do in the face?

587
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
Do, do, do, do, do, do-do-d Features

588
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:18,000
Rob, you need to cleanse the pallet.

589
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,000
Let's move on.

590
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
Copy, save us.

591
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:27,000
Let's get into some release dates, perhaps that will end the Daytona chat.

592
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,000
Never. It will never end that chat.

593
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:35,000
So coming out of this week is actually a pretty good line up of stuff.

594
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:40,000
Starting off we've got Borderlands, which is making its way out

595
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:49,720
Xbox 360. Did Rob mess up? No, just go ahead. I totally like skipped like three

596
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:52,880
stories in the show, but that's okay. Just do release dates now, we'll go back to it.

597
00:26:52,880 --> 00:27:02,240
Alright, anyways. Stop messing with my head, Rob! I got too distracted by Daytona, I'm sorry. But it's

598
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:08,440
good music to think too. Alright, so yeah, as I said, Borderlands coming out this

599
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:13,040
week. PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, pretty awesome looking, so definitely check that

600
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:26,680
out. If you're into the football, or soccer as we call it in the US, FIFA Soccer 2010 will be coming out on DS, PSP, Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, PlayStation 2, and Wii.

601
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:33,760
Smackdown vs. Brawl 2010 also coming out this week on pretty much everything.

602
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:46,360
Space Invaders Extreme 2 making its way out on DS, finally. It looks like the Wii version of NBA 2K10 was delayed to this week, so that'll be coming out as well.

603
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:52,640
Jillian Michaels Fitness Ultimatum 2010 on DS. Yippee, I know, I'm excited.

604
00:27:52,640 --> 00:28:02,560
Madagascar Carts on the Wii, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360, DS, and PSP. And then with the Wii, of course, they also have a version with

605
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:10,640
a wheel, because god damn it, no one can pretend that the Wii remote is a steering wheel without a plastic piece of crap that's got attached to it.

606
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:17,240
Marvel Superhero Squad coming out on PlayStation 2, Wii, and DS. If you like your

607
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:25,520
Marvel Ultimate Alliance Super Chibi. Tropico 3 coming out on PC. Charm Girls Club,

608
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:35,160
Perfect Prom coming out on DS. And yes, EA has a lot more to go with that as well. They have a few other Charm Girls games.

609
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:42,760
Charm Girls Club Pajama Party on the Wii. Ooh, exciting. Charm Girls Club Fashion Mall on DS.

610
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:54,800
And there was something with the prom, I know. Oh, Fashion Show, yes. And to go along with that, if you're not in the Charm Girls Club, maybe

611
00:28:54,800 --> 00:29:03,800
Littlest Pet Shop, because they're whoring that out this week as well. Littlest Pet Shop City Friends on DS this week. Littlest Pet Shop Friends on the Wii.

612
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:14,400
Littlest Pet Shop Country Friends on DS. And I'm sure there's one other one, but I don't really care. What a bunch of crap. Yes, exactly.

613
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:30,240
It's not coming out this week, but Cookie Mama 3 and Shop and Chop is coming out on DS. Oh, there's a game for Jamie. You know, it'd be better if it was Cookie Mama 3

614
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:40,880
Chop Shop, but you know, opportunity missed. Just in time for Halloween, too. Cookie Mama goes insane. You know, I have to tell you guys something. Before the show tonight,

615
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:48,120
Dark Soccer, you know, we were all running late tonight. If the show seems off tonight, it is. Dark Soccer, I think, is getting sick, which means

616
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:57,800
Loki and I are going to be sick. I've had the plague. Great. Cool, I get to play DJ Hero. Loki is not cool for me. I've got so much crap going on at work.

617
00:29:57,800 --> 00:30:06,600
Loki got here like five minutes before the show started tonight, and it was going to get chicken. And I overslept, so I got here way later than I usually do.

618
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:15,880
If Bobby was going to do a call tonight, we would have been screwed. We would have been ready. But here's the thing. Dark Soccer, she runs in here like a couple of minutes

619
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:26,760
before the show starts, and she goes, dude, I've got these grapes that are like eyeballs. They're so big. They are. They're the size of eyeballs. They're meat and grapes.

620
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:35,400
Well, is your mic on? No, I turned it off because you said I was typing too loud. That's right. Well, so you had these grapes that were the size of eyeballs, and it made me

621
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:43,480
think how, like, you remember when you'd go to those haunted houses when you were younger? They'd put frozen grapes in a bowl and tell you it was a bowl full of eyeballs?

622
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:51,360
Yeah. It just made me think of that. And then you mentioned Cooking Mama, and I think it's just in time for Halloween. What if Cooking Mama went crazy and it was a game like

623
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:59,720
Splatterhouse? That would be amazing. Or as actdeft in chat says, Cooking Mama, chop till you drop. A game like Splatterhouse? You mean delayed indefinitely? Okay, how about

624
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:23,720
Cooking Mama meets Dead Rising? That could work. Cooking Mama, Zombie Edition. Don't worry, Mama will braise. Ah, Cooking Mama as the cleaner. Don't worry, Mama will fix it. Or as darktids3 in chat says, Cooking Mama, rolling star.

625
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:33,720
Oh, that's going to be the joke all night. Other games coming out this week. Astro Boy, tying in with the new animated movie, coming out on Wii, PlayStation 2, DS, and PSP.

626
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:56,720
Secret Saturdays, Beasts of the Fifth Sun, coming out on Wii, PlayStation 2, DS. My Tran Wars on PSP. iCarly on DS and Wii. God, it's just pitiful. Mountain Sports on the Wii, yet another winter themed sports minigame collection.

627
00:31:56,720 --> 00:32:16,720
Imagine Fashion Designer World Tour on DS. Crap, crap, and more crap. Is there anything interesting? Bakugan on PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Wii, and DS. And I'm sure there's something I'm missing here. Good stuff.

628
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:26,720
Good stuff. Alien Monster Bowling League? No, no, that's not good. It's on the Wii. No, Your Mom the Game, I'm Sorry, is not coming out this week. It's too bad.

629
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:40,720
She got delayed. She got delayed, yes. Lips, number one hit on Xbox 360? No? If it doesn't have that Rolling Start song, I don't want it.

630
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:58,720
Maybe it does. The worst title for a game, but they had to do it. Diner Dash, Flow on the Go, for DS. No, that's wrong. So wrong. The joke's right itself, I don't have to say anything.

631
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:11,720
Medieval Games on the Wii for all your Ren Faire fans. Grand Theft Auto Chinatown Wars coming to the PSP this week, which looks pretty cool. Dragon Ball Revenge of King Piccolo on the Wii. Lots of stuff this week.

632
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:32,720
Motorstorm Arctic Edge finally coming out on PlayStation 2, and Nostalgia on DS. That actually looks pretty sweet. Star Wars The Force Unleashed Ultimate Sith Edition on PC. And finally, World of the Zoo on the Wii.

633
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:46,720
Finally. Let's see, I wanted to actually read something from chat here that was from Psycoon saying, Orange Lounge is one big tangent today. Yes, it is. And I'm going to start another one here.

634
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:54,720
Because speaking of release dates, going to last week's releases, we had a huge game come out this week that nobody mentioned during their gaming weeks. Uncharted 2.

635
00:33:54,720 --> 00:34:10,720
I, anywhere I look, I can't stop hearing about this game and how fucking amazing it's supposed to be. Like, you know, now keep in mind, I don't usually play a lot of the platformy Tomb Raider type of games, which I hear Uncharted 2 kind of is.

636
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:26,720
So I haven't really been paying attention. But now, as I will hear about how awesome this game is non-stop and how people are already calling it Game of the Year, I kind of feel like I need to play it. So I got to turn to Loki, who's talked about this game a little more on the show than I have.

637
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:33,720
What have you heard about this game? You didn't mention it either, but I seriously have not heard a single thing bad about it. Like, not one.

638
00:34:33,720 --> 00:34:40,720
I don't know. It got good reviews. I'm not buying it.

639
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:41,720
Why not?

640
00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:43,720
Because I don't want to buy it.

641
00:34:43,720 --> 00:34:46,720
Is it one of those things where it's like, oh well, you're too cool for schools?

642
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:56,720
No, no, no. It's not even that. It's an action game. Not even so much like Tomb Raider. I mean, the comparisons of the first game were kind of like, oh, it's Tomb Raider the guy.

643
00:34:56,720 --> 00:35:07,720
Not so much now. I mean, it's more of just an action game. It's a very cinematic action game. I just don't have time for it. And yeah, I can see why they're calling it Game of the Year. It's practically the only game coming from Sony this fall.

644
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:21,720
So it is the Game of the Year. I mean, they did have games in the spring, but for argument's sake, we're going to ignore those. But I don't know. It's good. I mean, don't get me wrong. Game of the Year? Probably not.

645
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:31,720
Kind of some polarizing stuff in chat. Psycoon says, if I got a free copy, I would totally play it. That's a good point. Games are 60 bucks. But again, I haven't heard a negative thing about this game. It's probably worth it.

646
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:41,720
And HungryMrKrunk says, why aren't you going to buy it? What? Seriously? What? Daytona?

647
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:53,720
I mean, there are a lot of people that probably think you're crazy for what you just said. I at least want to rent it and see if I like it and get us into it as everyone else does. So I apologize I didn't play it for this week.

648
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:58,720
I'm not buying Modern Warfare 2 either. Ooh, I'm crazy.

649
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:03,720
And GameGuru says, Game of the Year for Sony fanboy maybes. Ooh, yikes.

650
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:17,720
Don't get me wrong. It is probably going to be the best Playstation 3 game other than Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 that comes out this year. But that's about it. Best Sony made game this year? Yes.

651
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:35,720
I'll probably play it at some point. I can never resist peer pressure. Okay, anyway, back to release dates. Sorry. Going to Japan and looking at the Japanese release dates. FIFA Soccer 10 World Class Soccer comes out in Japan as well as Forza Motorsport 3 gets its run in Japan. Those both coming out on the 22nd of October.

652
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:50,720
Moving on over to, of course, the Playstation 3. FIFA Soccer 10 also comes out over there. That's really the only major release in Japan this week on the PS3. And moving on over to the Nintendo Wii, another port of FIFA 10 World Class Soccer.

653
00:36:50,720 --> 00:37:08,720
There's some other games there as well, including Sukiban Satcho Reina Wii comes out on the Wii. And I like this because the box art is like this hot pink box art. And it's just kittens all over it. And it looks like it's like a lolcat game. Like I'm not even kidding.

654
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:24,720
Oh my god. I shit you not. It's Keyboard Cat. There's a scene with a cat playing the piano. It's Keyboard Cat and Lolcat like in a game for the Wii. That is Game of the Year right there. I'm sorry. Fuck Uncharted. Fuck it. This is the Game of the Year right here.

655
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:49,720
Why don't they release this crap over here? D3, come on. If there is a game that you need to localize for the US, it is this game. They're dancing with kittens and oh my god is that cat shooting a laser. Oh my god. This is it right here. Again, I'm going to say this name again.

656
00:37:49,720 --> 00:38:10,720
I'm going to order that game. It is Sukiban Satcho Reina Wii. Question for you Rob. And this sort of ties in with that. Why don't we move back to the old studio again? I don't know. Because we should. Why? Because I'll get that game and then we can do it on Justin TV. Oh maybe at some point.

657
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:26,720
I can get that set up here. We just need the camera. I can get the camera. That's easy. We can do it in the vault. We'll figure it out. But anyhow, the chat was demanding to check out that game in the chat rooms. I posted a link in chat. I apologize to those on the podcast because I can't link it to you.

658
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:47,720
But again, that's S-U-K-E-B-A-N. Sukiban. S-H-A-C-H-O-U. Satcho. Reina. R-E-N-A. Wii. That's the name of the game. And it's cats, cats and more cats. It's an action game. So I mean seriously, how can you say Uncharted 2 is the game of the year when you have this game coming out on the Wii?

659
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:56,720
I just don't. I think it's clearly. That was a statement said without considering the rest of the year.

660
00:38:56,720 --> 00:39:02,720
Wow. I'm actually looking up reviews on it. To make sure it's lolcats the game.

661
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:05,720
Let us know what you find.

662
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:22,720
Ok well I still have to do. Well hold on, hold on. I got some more releases here. PlayStation 2. Beatmania 2DX 16 Empress is making its way out right now. I think it was out a little early for some people. I think it just came out in Japan this past week.

663
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:32,720
But some of your import stores will finally have it in stock this week. They know that this is one of the big games people like to import. And it's a huge release obviously being the last 2DX game on PlayStation 2. So look for that.

664
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:41,720
On the Nintendo DS Element Hunters comes out in Japan this week as well as Rune Factory 3. And a game called Roller Angels. Check that out.

665
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:53,720
And then lastly on the Sony PSP. Again these are Japanese release dates. Another release of FIFA Soccer 10. Obviously soccer is very big in countries that aren't the US.

666
00:39:53,720 --> 00:40:13,720
And a game called Haru Kanaru Toki no Naka Day 3 Unme no Meikyu Aizu Ban or Treasure Box. And I've learned to look up these games and make sure they aren't like more cat games. Because they might have a weird title but it might be awesome.

667
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:22,720
But this is actually a role playing game and it's a romance simulation game. But it has to do with historical characters. Yes that's right I said romance game with historical characters.

668
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:30,720
I love how this cat game is so realistic because they have a mini dancing game where the guy is dancing around and the cat is just like I don't care.

669
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:42,720
I'm looking at the website for the game which sadly because it's all image files I can't read but like half of it. So it looks like it's a cat raising sim. Do they have a Twitter? They freaking have a Twitter.

670
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:45,720
But it's all in Japanese right? I'm gonna follow the Japanese Twitter.

671
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:59,720
Alright you do that. Actdeft in chat says now the folks in chat are kind of looking at what we just posted. Leo Shen says I got my copy. Oh he might have been talking about Beatmania because I just mentioned that.

672
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:03,720
Actdeft says best Wii game ever. Not even Epic Mickey will surpass this game.

673
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:10,720
Okay I found the description from the Twitter so I'm running it through the Nifty translator. And we'll see what it says.

674
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:12,720
Alright let me know what happens.

675
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:24,720
Okay. Cat president and choking employee recruitment on large scale. Famous cat Rena of the Superman nature blog finally appears in the game. Let's work also by you under the cat president.

676
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:26,720
What the hell does that mean?

677
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:28,720
Because it's translating.

678
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:30,720
That doesn't even fucking make sense. I love it.

679
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:46,720
So is the president of cats or something? I guess this cat Rena is a famous cat. I've actually heard of the cat before. I'm getting this game. Fuck it. I'm getting it.

680
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:51,720
Rob let's get the communal OLR copy and find a Wii that we can play it on.

681
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:53,720
Amazing. Loki has one right?

682
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:57,720
I have a Wii that I'll play it on. We'll have this game. Don't worry. It'll be coming.

683
00:41:57,720 --> 00:42:08,720
Actually this was just sent to me in chat is that we actually have an exclusive sneak peek at the soundtrack for this game. It's amazing.

684
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:12,720
That sounds so familiar.

685
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:19,720
Okay the next one you're going to hear is my microphone connecting with the back of Rob's head. Ready? One, two.

686
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:23,720
Ow!

687
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:31,720
Anyhow, President Cat.

688
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:37,720
Seriously every other podcast you listen to, every single one of them will mention Uncharted 2 this week.

689
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:43,720
And they will suck its dick to no end. What other show are you going to hear about this game on?

690
00:42:43,720 --> 00:42:46,720
I challenge you. What other show?

691
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:51,720
Watch there's probably at least five other shows that mention it. But seriously.

692
00:42:51,720 --> 00:42:53,720
There's a reason we're different.

693
00:42:53,720 --> 00:42:54,720
I'm picking a random tweet.

694
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:56,720
Alright fine. But then you gotta get into UK releases.

695
00:42:56,720 --> 00:43:02,720
Okay this is just hilarious. And I love also listing stuff through the nifty translator.

696
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:04,720
Okay.

697
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:10,720
Oh never mind. Just talking about a grade schooler following their Wii. Their Twitter.

698
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:15,720
Yeah if anyone who can read Japanese wants to follow their Twitter it's Renawii.

699
00:43:15,720 --> 00:43:19,720
Someone go start translating that for me right now.

700
00:43:19,720 --> 00:43:21,720
Ooh I just forgot. I can run the whole thing through.

701
00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:24,720
You need to like tweet to them you know. Quoting them or something.

702
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:28,720
Yeah just tweet to them and say release your game in English please.

703
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:29,720
Best game ever.

704
00:43:29,720 --> 00:43:31,720
No I'm going to go on the OLR Twitter right now and tweet to them.

705
00:43:31,720 --> 00:43:34,720
Actually I'm running their Twitter through Nifty.

706
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:41,720
I love. Anyone if you want one of the best translators from Japanese to English.

707
00:43:41,720 --> 00:43:45,720
Seriously. Just look up Nifty Global Gate.

708
00:43:45,720 --> 00:43:51,720
So yeah. Say they keep calling it President Rina.

709
00:43:51,720 --> 00:43:57,720
Okay. I'm going to tweet them right now from the OLR account. Can you send me the link to their Twitter in chat?

710
00:43:57,720 --> 00:43:58,720
Yeah.

711
00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:02,720
And then can we do the UK releases? Sorry I know you're like trying to do five things at once but.

712
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:04,720
Where's IRC? There it is.

713
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:12,720
Alright. So she's going to get me the Twitter there and I'm going to tweet them from the OLR account saying we demand that you release this game in English.

714
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:14,720
I'm linking it to the main chat room too because I want everyone.

715
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:16,720
Alright. Sweet. I'm going to go tweet them right now.

716
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:26,720
We want this game. We want President Kat. Sacho means Kat. President by the way. Rob. Sacho means President.

717
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:32,720
Gotcha. Well now I learned a little Japanese today. Alright. Let's do UK releases.

718
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:37,720
Okay. To end this stuff on the 23rd we have Borderlands. We have CSI Deadly Intent.

719
00:44:37,720 --> 00:44:45,720
Fairy Tail Fights. Forza Motorsport 3. Ghostbusters on PSP. Grand Theft Auto Chinatown Wars on PSP.

720
00:44:45,720 --> 00:44:54,720
Lips number one hits. What the fuck ever. Marvel Superhero Squad. Nintendo Presents Style Boutique. Ew.

721
00:44:54,720 --> 00:45:03,720
Pro Evolution Soccer 2010. WWE Smackdown vs Raw 2010. And that's it.

722
00:45:03,720 --> 00:45:04,720
Alright.

723
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:06,720
And President Kat!

724
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:08,720
No. Not in the. Here's what I'm saying to them.

725
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:10,720
I'm making an icon of President Kat.

726
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:14,720
We are talking about your game on our show right now and we demand you release it in English in the US.

727
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:17,720
President Kat for USA.

728
00:45:17,720 --> 00:45:26,720
Alright. In fact. Please retweet the fuck out of this please. Thank you. I'm going to post it shortly.

729
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:28,720
Okay.

730
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:35,720
Also if any of our listeners that speak Japanese please retweet it to them in Japanese. Thank you.

731
00:45:35,720 --> 00:45:40,720
This needs to happen. Alright. Anyway. There's probably some people listening to this show right now like.

732
00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:41,720
Release date.

733
00:45:41,720 --> 00:45:42,720
What are they smoking tonight?

734
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:47,720
10-22. Countdown will deliver a picture of their cute and funny friend, Rina.

735
00:45:47,720 --> 00:45:52,720
Is a marijuana farm burning in Sacramento tonight? I mean seriously. What is going on?

736
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:56,720
SSJ100 Matt says Shermie is secretary of Katnipp.

737
00:45:56,720 --> 00:45:58,720
Dude I love this Kat.

738
00:45:58,720 --> 00:46:04,720
Alright. Moving on there's other video gaming stories. Believe it or not. Other than President Kat we will keep you posted.

739
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:11,720
Please again. Please please please retweet our message to Rina Wee. We want them to notice. Please.

740
00:46:11,720 --> 00:46:12,720
Okay.

741
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:14,720
We want President Kat.

742
00:46:14,720 --> 00:46:22,720
Alright. In other news that's not President Kat related and unfortunately makes it less important is Blaze.

743
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:27,720
Which is a company that makes third party peripherals for game systems like the Wii and the PlayStation 3.

744
00:46:27,720 --> 00:46:37,720
Well they have now put out a brand new motion 3D controller that looks exactly like a Wii remote.

745
00:46:37,720 --> 00:46:40,720
So much so I wouldn't be surprised if they get sued for it.

746
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:46,720
But. Hey whatever. It says it works fine at Sega Tennis and Tiger Woods.

747
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:50,720
But it looks exactly like a Wii remote.

748
00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:54,720
Good luck with your lawsuit.

749
00:46:54,720 --> 00:47:07,720
However. There's always a however. However. It will not work with President Kat because President Kat is coming out on the Wii and not the PlayStation 3.

750
00:47:07,720 --> 00:47:08,720
Anyway.

751
00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:15,720
I'm also making a call by the way for making President Kat be a trending topic.

752
00:47:15,720 --> 00:47:25,720
I hope it works. Alright. Here's the thing. Why are they doing this when the PlayStation 3 is doing their own?

753
00:47:25,720 --> 00:47:28,720
And how are they possibly getting away with it without Sony bringing the smack down?

754
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:32,720
I mean doesn't this kind of thing have to have some type of Sony license anyway?

755
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:35,720
Especially considering the fact that it works with existing games?

756
00:47:35,720 --> 00:47:45,720
Maybe. I don't know how they're doing it. But it'll be something that's not very useful.

757
00:47:45,720 --> 00:47:51,720
Probably won't sell that much. Especially when the Cosmic Ice Cream Cones come out.

758
00:47:51,720 --> 00:47:58,720
But for right now. Hey if you want to buy this to use in your two games that it supports.

759
00:47:58,720 --> 00:48:01,720
More power to you I guess.

760
00:48:01,720 --> 00:48:05,720
I don't even really know how it'd work because it doesn't look like it has analog sticks on it.

761
00:48:05,720 --> 00:48:09,720
I mean maybe that little grey circle is supposed to be an analog stick.

762
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:13,720
But I mean it looks like it's missing most of the buttons on there.

763
00:48:13,720 --> 00:48:19,720
So I don't know. I'm confused.

764
00:48:19,720 --> 00:48:25,720
It just looks like a cheap knockoff. Which I'm sure it is. But I still don't understand the legal end of it.

765
00:48:25,720 --> 00:48:29,720
Like how they can possibly get away with it and how Sony is letting it happen.

766
00:48:29,720 --> 00:48:31,720
I guess it looks different enough than the Wii Remote.

767
00:48:31,720 --> 00:48:35,720
But it's basically got the trigger underneath where the B button would normally be.

768
00:48:35,720 --> 00:48:39,720
It's got the directional pad at the top just like the Wii Remote.

769
00:48:39,720 --> 00:48:43,720
Instead of just the 1 and 2 button at the bottom like the Wii Remote.

770
00:48:43,720 --> 00:48:47,720
It has the 4 buttons that are normally on the face of the controller.

771
00:48:47,720 --> 00:48:51,720
In the middle it's got 3 other buttons which I can't really read what they say.

772
00:48:51,720 --> 00:48:55,720
I think it's Start, Select, and maybe the PlayStation button.

773
00:48:55,720 --> 00:49:01,720
And then 3 more buttons kind of in the middle there which I have no idea what those do either.

774
00:49:01,720 --> 00:49:07,720
But whatever. Like I said, if you really want to buy it then check it out I guess.

775
00:49:07,720 --> 00:49:13,720
But it looks like cheap knockoff crap and you'd better just wait for the real thing.

776
00:49:13,720 --> 00:49:19,720
It's tough when you're making this controller that really serves somewhat of a purpose but it's not that important.

777
00:49:19,720 --> 00:49:27,720
It's not anything like the Frag FX or something like that where you're actually making something that you use a mouse to aim or something like that.

778
00:49:27,720 --> 00:49:29,720
So it's more like PC.

779
00:49:29,720 --> 00:49:42,720
But this, I guess it's more immersive for Tiger Woods but I'd really just wait for the official motion controller from Sony because it'll probably be even better.

780
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:48,720
And what's the point in dropping money now for something that's not very good when you can just wait a few more months and the official thing comes out.

781
00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:50,720
I don't know.

782
00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:55,720
Alright. Moving on to something that's so interesting.

783
00:49:55,720 --> 00:49:57,720
I don't even know how to define this here.

784
00:49:57,720 --> 00:49:59,720
This is a complete 180. A different type of story here.

785
00:49:59,720 --> 00:50:01,720
But it has to do with Phantasy Star Portable 2.

786
00:50:01,720 --> 00:50:04,720
Which, you know, we've been talking about Sega and crazy things from Japan tonight.

787
00:50:04,720 --> 00:50:06,720
This is right up the alley of these types of stories.

788
00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:14,720
Phantasy Star Portable 2 is going to be getting some product placement and it's kind of extreme.

789
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:22,720
First off, there's going to be Fanta products in the game like the drink, you know, Wanna Fanta, that whole thing are going to be showing up in Phantasy Star Portable 2.

790
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:23,720
They're still around.

791
00:50:23,720 --> 00:50:27,720
Well, you're talking about the official drink of Germany during World War 2.

792
00:50:27,720 --> 00:50:28,720
I guess.

793
00:50:28,720 --> 00:50:34,720
But then also, something to note is that Pizza Hut branding is now going to show up in the game.

794
00:50:34,720 --> 00:50:43,720
Apparently, you're actually going to be able to have like pizza related shields and swords and things of that note.

795
00:50:43,720 --> 00:50:51,720
And I'm looking at the site that is running the story here, andreasang.com.

796
00:50:51,720 --> 00:50:55,720
And they actually have screenshots of this chick and it doesn't look photoshopped.

797
00:50:55,720 --> 00:50:56,720
Like, I think this is the real deal.

798
00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:57,720
Oh, that's the real deal.

799
00:50:57,720 --> 00:51:01,720
A little Pizza Hut box and a pizza pan.

800
00:51:01,720 --> 00:51:04,720
Yes, you will actually be able to get like Pizza 2.

801
00:51:04,720 --> 00:51:12,720
Seafood mixed pizza for 2500 Meseta and cheese and cheese pizza for 1900 Meseta will actually be available in the game.

802
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:16,720
There's a little like pizza place in the game and so forth.

803
00:51:16,720 --> 00:51:20,720
So, I mean, I just don't really like get it.

804
00:51:20,720 --> 00:51:24,720
Like, A, that sword and shield is god awful ugly.

805
00:51:24,720 --> 00:51:29,720
But, I mean, what does pizza have to do with Phantasy Star?

806
00:51:29,720 --> 00:51:34,720
I mean, I guess it's like product placement, just like you see in the billboards and the racing games here in the US.

807
00:51:34,720 --> 00:51:36,720
But it's a little extreme, don't you think?

808
00:51:36,720 --> 00:51:41,720
Well, keep in mind, Sega had a whole game based around Pepsi.

809
00:51:41,720 --> 00:51:44,720
This isn't Farfetch'd.

810
00:51:44,720 --> 00:51:45,720
I guess.

811
00:51:45,720 --> 00:51:49,720
Pepsiman, Rob! They need Pepsiman versus Pizza Hut.

812
00:51:49,720 --> 00:51:52,720
You can't help but go, okay, this is a little bit much.

813
00:51:52,720 --> 00:51:56,720
Like, it's one thing in Crazy Taxi to have the KFC and Pizza Hut that you have to drop people off.

814
00:51:56,720 --> 00:51:59,720
Doesn't Pepsi Cola own Pizza Hut?

815
00:51:59,720 --> 00:52:01,720
I think so, yeah.

816
00:52:01,720 --> 00:52:03,720
Is Pepsi gonna buy Sega? Is that where we're going?

817
00:52:03,720 --> 00:52:06,720
Maybe that's just what's gonna happen, I don't know.

818
00:52:06,720 --> 00:52:12,720
Tigerclaw in chat says, I remember seeing Pizza Hut billboards in TMNT 2, the arcade on the NES.

819
00:52:12,720 --> 00:52:16,720
Yeah, it's not that, like, product placement in video games is anything new, although, you know, I don't know how-

820
00:52:16,720 --> 00:52:17,720
It was Domino's in the movie.

821
00:52:17,720 --> 00:52:19,720
I don't know if it's often talked about.

822
00:52:19,720 --> 00:52:25,720
But, I mean, when it gets, like, in your face so much as, like, you're carrying around a giant Pizza Hut box,

823
00:52:25,720 --> 00:52:29,720
and, I guess, hitting monsters with it or blocking their attacks with it,

824
00:52:29,720 --> 00:52:35,720
I mean, it kind of starts to cross the line of WTF, LOL.

825
00:52:35,720 --> 00:52:41,720
Deathwishing says, the acceptable games with product placement are sports and racing games unless they're futuristic,

826
00:52:41,720 --> 00:52:44,720
but if it's a shooter or RPG, no, no.

827
00:52:44,720 --> 00:52:49,720
And it's not cheeseball enough to where, you know, they really could be over the top with everything, like,

828
00:52:49,720 --> 00:52:56,720
you know, have product placement everywhere and just, like, ridiculous weapons based on, you know,

829
00:52:56,720 --> 00:53:01,720
you know, the golden arches or something, you know, that'd be kind of funny.

830
00:53:01,720 --> 00:53:03,720
Crazy, crazy.

831
00:53:03,720 --> 00:53:06,720
By the way, thank you so much to the people that are retweeting our message.

832
00:53:06,720 --> 00:53:10,720
We have almost, like, a full page of tweets there of people retweeting our message.

833
00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:13,720
They've got to see it. You know they're going to see it.

834
00:53:13,720 --> 00:53:19,720
I've actually tried to translate a little bit more of it, so I think I've got the general story of the game.

835
00:53:19,720 --> 00:53:20,720
Yeah.

836
00:53:20,720 --> 00:53:29,720
So, you play as the cat, and you are part of a trio called Let's Going 3, so I'm guessing it'd be Ikimas 3, I guess.

837
00:53:29,720 --> 00:53:35,720
And they are a very, very popular trio of cats.

838
00:53:35,720 --> 00:53:46,720
And so, Rina, who is the editor-in-chief of production of a company, I guess, that puts out Shogakuken,

839
00:53:46,720 --> 00:53:51,720
which is, like, a shoujo manga book, I guess.

840
00:53:51,720 --> 00:53:55,720
This is just what I'm getting from the translation and from what little I can read.

841
00:53:55,720 --> 00:54:04,720
But basically, the whole point is you're trying to get Rina and the staff to try to publish, I guess, the magazine

842
00:54:04,720 --> 00:54:06,720
and try to do all this other stuff.

843
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:09,720
You have a minigame where you play the piano, and you have exercises,

844
00:54:09,720 --> 00:54:13,720
but the whole point of it is to become president of the company.

845
00:54:13,720 --> 00:54:15,720
Oh, and you have cosplay.

846
00:54:15,720 --> 00:54:16,720
A cat?

847
00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:17,720
You have kitty cosplay.

848
00:54:17,720 --> 00:54:20,720
A cat that publishes an anime magazine?

849
00:54:20,720 --> 00:54:21,720
No.

850
00:54:21,720 --> 00:54:23,720
Mongo, whatever.

851
00:54:23,720 --> 00:54:27,720
That's fucking awesome.

852
00:54:27,720 --> 00:54:30,720
You have sixteen different kinds of cosplay.

853
00:54:30,720 --> 00:54:32,720
I'm just giggling. This game is funny.

854
00:54:32,720 --> 00:54:35,720
This is... seriously, game of the year.

855
00:54:35,720 --> 00:54:37,720
This is gonna save the Wii.

856
00:54:37,720 --> 00:54:44,720
I mean, because this is kind of like... the Wii is kind of a preposterous system to begin with.

857
00:54:44,720 --> 00:54:46,720
This game just is right at home.

858
00:54:46,720 --> 00:54:50,720
The Wii needs more games that are just OMG, WTF like this.

859
00:54:50,720 --> 00:54:51,720
Amazing.

860
00:54:51,720 --> 00:54:55,720
An Amazon JP is selling it for 4,410 yen.

861
00:54:55,720 --> 00:54:58,720
When does it come out? Oh no, duh, I just read it during Japanese releases.

862
00:54:58,720 --> 00:54:59,720
It's out this week.

863
00:54:59,720 --> 00:55:00,720
Yeah, this week.

864
00:55:00,720 --> 00:55:02,720
Someone buy me this.

865
00:55:02,720 --> 00:55:06,720
Seriously, this is the type of random crap I would buy on Dreamcast.

866
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:09,720
Like, okay, I bought Super Producers.

867
00:55:09,720 --> 00:55:12,720
If that game isn't random, I don't know what is.

868
00:55:12,720 --> 00:55:16,720
Or like, what was it, the Roommate 202 or something?

869
00:55:16,720 --> 00:55:17,720
Oh, I remember that one.

870
00:55:17,720 --> 00:55:18,720
Or 232?

871
00:55:18,720 --> 00:55:19,720
Yeah. Oh my god.

872
00:55:19,720 --> 00:55:22,720
This is along the same... the Wii is the new Dreamcast.

873
00:55:22,720 --> 00:55:24,720
Rob, the Wii is the Dreamcast.

874
00:55:24,720 --> 00:55:28,720
Except, the Wii is actually selling a lot to soccer moms across America.

875
00:55:28,720 --> 00:55:30,720
Alright, anyhow, let's move on with more stories.

876
00:55:30,720 --> 00:55:32,720
DarkSakura, you're up.

877
00:55:32,720 --> 00:55:37,720
I hate to make President Cat take over this whole show, but it's fucking fascinating.

878
00:55:37,720 --> 00:55:39,720
I think it's fantastic.

879
00:55:39,720 --> 00:55:44,720
Okay, so Microsoft seems to think that the PS3 is screwed this year.

880
00:55:44,720 --> 00:55:48,720
They think that the 360 will outsell the PS3.

881
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:55,720
Aaron Greenberg, who is the big mouth of Microsoft,

882
00:55:55,720 --> 00:56:00,720
is saying that when NPD releases the September sales,

883
00:56:00,720 --> 00:56:06,720
they expect the PS3 is going to come in with the most units sold for the month

884
00:56:06,720 --> 00:56:10,720
because of the Slim release, but overall,

885
00:56:10,720 --> 00:56:15,720
that the Xbox 360 is still going to outsell for the calendar year

886
00:56:15,720 --> 00:56:17,720
and for the entire system generation.

887
00:56:17,720 --> 00:56:24,720
He compares it to a game of baseball where they may be ahead one inning,

888
00:56:24,720 --> 00:56:27,720
but it's what you get by the end of the game, that's what counts.

889
00:56:27,720 --> 00:56:32,720
So you may have won the battle, but you haven't won the war type of thing.

890
00:56:32,720 --> 00:56:33,720
Exactly.

891
00:56:33,720 --> 00:56:35,720
This is just one month.

892
00:56:35,720 --> 00:56:38,720
And I have to agree with the article, this is burn.

893
00:56:38,720 --> 00:56:40,720
He's quoted saying,

894
00:56:40,720 --> 00:56:44,720
Sony, for example, has publicly noted that they lose money on every console they sell,

895
00:56:44,720 --> 00:56:46,720
and with the price cut, they're now losing even more money.

896
00:56:46,720 --> 00:56:50,720
So even with the PS3 in the market today at $299,

897
00:56:50,720 --> 00:56:54,720
you have to question if their business model is sustainable.

898
00:56:54,720 --> 00:56:56,720
I don't know.

899
00:56:56,720 --> 00:56:59,720
You know, as much as I think, you know,

900
00:56:59,720 --> 00:57:04,720
and I do admit I've been kind of in the past, especially on this show,

901
00:57:04,720 --> 00:57:07,720
like really slanted towards 360.

902
00:57:07,720 --> 00:57:11,720
I think especially this year, I have come a long way towards,

903
00:57:11,720 --> 00:57:14,720
and I don't mean in reporting, I mean in, you know,

904
00:57:14,720 --> 00:57:16,720
just what I play myself and what I've enjoyed.

905
00:57:16,720 --> 00:57:19,720
I think this year especially, I think PS3 has gained a lot with me,

906
00:57:19,720 --> 00:57:22,720
and I think, you know, kind of going into this holiday season,

907
00:57:22,720 --> 00:57:25,720
I think the price drop was the best freaking thing they could do.

908
00:57:25,720 --> 00:57:28,720
Let me tell you a true story, totally true,

909
00:57:28,720 --> 00:57:32,720
is that the other night I was eating dinner with some co-workers,

910
00:57:32,720 --> 00:57:35,720
and the people at the table next to us,

911
00:57:35,720 --> 00:57:39,720
some like husbands and wives, about six of them,

912
00:57:39,720 --> 00:57:43,720
in their mid-20s, and they were talking about video games,

913
00:57:43,720 --> 00:57:47,720
and so I couldn't help but overhear because I'm a nosy motherfucker.

914
00:57:47,720 --> 00:57:51,720
So I actually heard them talking about the Xbox 360 and the PlayStation 3,

915
00:57:51,720 --> 00:57:54,720
and the guy was talking about how he's going to sell back his 360,

916
00:57:54,720 --> 00:57:57,720
and the one guy actually said, and it had nothing to do with the quality,

917
00:57:57,720 --> 00:57:59,720
I think they were talking financers or something,

918
00:57:59,720 --> 00:58:00,720
I don't know, I didn't hear everything.

919
00:58:00,720 --> 00:58:02,720
But the one guy said, well, you know, this holiday season,

920
00:58:02,720 --> 00:58:03,720
I kind of want to get a game system,

921
00:58:03,720 --> 00:58:08,720
but I think I want to get a PlayStation 3 because, dude, it has Blu-Ray.

922
00:58:08,720 --> 00:58:12,720
You know, and now that those systems are getting closer to the same price,

923
00:58:12,720 --> 00:58:15,720
you know, again, I don't think these guys were like hardcore gamers,

924
00:58:15,720 --> 00:58:17,720
but they are just average people.

925
00:58:17,720 --> 00:58:18,720
I overheard at a restaurant.

926
00:58:18,720 --> 00:58:22,720
I think that Blu-Ray this Christmas season is going to carry a lot of weight,

927
00:58:22,720 --> 00:58:24,720
and Microsoft's going to feel it.

928
00:58:24,720 --> 00:58:30,720
But you can get a better quality Blu-Ray player now for cheaper

929
00:58:30,720 --> 00:58:32,720
than the entire system costs.

930
00:58:32,720 --> 00:58:35,720
You could, for the cost of a good PS3 bundle,

931
00:58:35,720 --> 00:58:38,720
you could buy an Xbox 360 and a better Blu-Ray player.

932
00:58:38,720 --> 00:58:43,720
I get that, but what about that PlayStation 2 is a DVD player mentality

933
00:58:43,720 --> 00:58:45,720
that really helped out that system when it needed it?

934
00:58:45,720 --> 00:58:49,720
You know, you, me, the other gamers of America, we get that.

935
00:58:49,720 --> 00:58:52,720
But the people that are purchasing things en masse from Wal-Mart

936
00:58:52,720 --> 00:58:55,720
and Target to put under Christmas trees, are they going to get that?

937
00:58:55,720 --> 00:59:00,720
I still don't think that it's enough to save the system

938
00:59:00,720 --> 00:59:04,720
because, I mean, really, I would have to see hard numbers.

939
00:59:04,720 --> 00:59:06,720
I would have to look at their financial reports.

940
00:59:06,720 --> 00:59:10,720
I'd have to see what it costs to produce a system, what their marketing costs.

941
00:59:10,720 --> 00:59:15,720
Basically, I'd have to see overhead versus sales to get an idea to project.

942
00:59:15,720 --> 00:59:20,720
It seems to me that they would have to sell a hell of a lot to make up past losses

943
00:59:20,720 --> 00:59:26,720
and their current losses for overall system sales versus the overhead.

944
00:59:26,720 --> 00:59:27,720
Now, don't get me wrong.

945
00:59:27,720 --> 00:59:29,720
Can you tell I've been working in finance too long?

946
00:59:29,720 --> 00:59:30,720
Now, don't get me wrong.

947
00:59:30,720 --> 00:59:34,720
I'm not trying to say that I suddenly hate the 360.

948
00:59:34,720 --> 00:59:35,720
That's certainly not true.

949
00:59:35,720 --> 00:59:39,720
I think either way, Microsoft is going to definitely give them a run for their money,

950
00:59:39,720 --> 00:59:42,720
and they're probably, in the end, will still come out ahead.

951
00:59:42,720 --> 00:59:46,720
But I think if they were smart, what Microsoft would do is kind of go for the jugular.

952
00:59:46,720 --> 00:59:51,720
What's the biggest, for the mass population, asset of the PlayStation 3? Blu-ray.

953
00:59:51,720 --> 00:59:56,720
But what does the 360 have? Downloadable movies with Netflix specifically.

954
00:59:56,720 --> 01:00:00,720
I think if they start marketing a lot with that in their Netflix partnership,

955
01:00:00,720 --> 01:00:05,720
they are very likely to keep their head above water

956
01:00:05,720 --> 01:00:09,720
and not let Sony get them down too bad outside of just September.

957
01:00:09,720 --> 01:00:10,720
But we'll see.

958
01:00:10,720 --> 01:00:12,720
It's going to be a very interesting holiday season.

959
01:00:12,720 --> 01:00:13,720
I can't wait to see what happens.

960
01:00:13,720 --> 01:00:15,720
I know what would save the PS3, Rob.

961
01:00:15,720 --> 01:00:16,720
What?

962
01:00:16,720 --> 01:00:18,720
President Cat.

963
01:00:18,720 --> 01:00:21,720
Or how about Daytona?

964
01:00:21,720 --> 01:00:25,720
No, President Cat.

965
01:00:25,720 --> 01:00:26,720
Arena for President.

966
01:00:26,720 --> 01:00:30,720
Moving on. Loki, more video game news, please.

967
01:00:30,720 --> 01:00:32,720
That doesn't have to do with Cats.

968
01:00:32,720 --> 01:00:37,720
Well, one thing that Sony doesn't have, unfortunately, is the Ballad of Gay Tony.

969
01:00:37,720 --> 01:00:40,720
And that will be coming out, actually, next week.

970
01:00:40,720 --> 01:00:44,720
Well, the 29th, I guess, two weeks.

971
01:00:44,720 --> 01:00:52,720
They did release some new information regarding the multiplayer in the new episode for the 360.

972
01:00:52,720 --> 01:00:58,720
Some of the things that they get, new areas to have Deathmatch and Team Deathmatches,

973
01:00:58,720 --> 01:01:02,720
including some new and closed areas as well.

974
01:01:02,720 --> 01:01:08,720
Some that are actually in the clubs.

975
01:01:08,720 --> 01:01:13,720
Most of the Deathmatch maps that are out there right now for Grand Theft Auto

976
01:01:13,720 --> 01:01:15,720
were all just pretty much spots in the city.

977
01:01:15,720 --> 01:01:17,720
But these are actually in addition to that stuff.

978
01:01:17,720 --> 01:01:20,720
At least, I hope it's in addition to that and not just replacing it

979
01:01:20,720 --> 01:01:23,720
because that would really suck if they did replace it.

980
01:01:23,720 --> 01:01:25,720
But we'll see.

981
01:01:25,720 --> 01:01:31,720
Some other new things adding to Deathmatch other than just locations.

982
01:01:31,720 --> 01:01:37,720
They have killstreak bonuses, where if you kill 3 people, 5 people, or 10 people in a row,

983
01:01:37,720 --> 01:01:40,720
you get health and armor bonuses.

984
01:01:40,720 --> 01:01:46,720
And also, if someone kills you, breaking your streak, they will earn $125 instead of just $100.

985
01:01:46,720 --> 01:01:52,720
Also, for assists, where you do damage to somebody and someone else takes the kill for it,

986
01:01:52,720 --> 01:01:56,720
you also make $25 for that, whereas before you made nothing.

987
01:01:56,720 --> 01:02:01,720
And of course, they have new weapon classes to break things apart.

988
01:02:01,720 --> 01:02:06,720
They've got episodic, automatic, sniper rifles, explosives, and sticky bombs.

989
01:02:06,720 --> 01:02:08,720
I'm kind of interested about the episodic.

990
01:02:08,720 --> 01:02:11,720
Lol, gay Tony has sticky bombs.

991
01:02:11,720 --> 01:02:18,720
Hahaha. I'm interested to see if they actually, since it does have episodic,

992
01:02:18,720 --> 01:02:22,720
if it will include both the first and second episodes,

993
01:02:22,720 --> 01:02:26,720
which would be pretty awesome if they had some sort of cross-play with that.

994
01:02:26,720 --> 01:02:33,720
Free mode, they've added some new options, including the ability to use the parachutes in the game,

995
01:02:33,720 --> 01:02:38,720
and of course your tanks and the new buzzard attack helicopter, which is pretty awesome.

996
01:02:38,720 --> 01:02:46,720
And that's pretty much it for right now, but very excited about this new expansion coming out.

997
01:02:46,720 --> 01:02:50,720
Okay, so I have to admit, as somebody who doesn't really play a lot of Grand Theft Auto,

998
01:02:50,720 --> 01:02:53,720
a lot of that was blah blah blah to me, so you have to kind of translate.

999
01:02:53,720 --> 01:02:55,720
Is this going to be a good thing for the game?

1000
01:02:55,720 --> 01:02:58,720
Yes, it's going to be awesome. It's going to basically enhance multiplayer a lot,

1001
01:02:58,720 --> 01:03:03,720
and bring it to the over-the-topness of the other Grand Theft Auto games.

1002
01:03:03,720 --> 01:03:06,720
Alright, and that's what people love about it, right?

1003
01:03:06,720 --> 01:03:08,720
Yes, alright.

1004
01:03:08,720 --> 01:03:15,720
Moving on, in other news, speaking of big multiplayer games, Left 4 Dead, as you know, there was a boycott.

1005
01:03:15,720 --> 01:03:20,720
41,000 people had made this group on Steam, the Left 4 Dead 2 boycott group.

1006
01:03:20,720 --> 01:03:24,720
Apparently, it has been brought to an end.

1007
01:03:24,720 --> 01:03:28,720
And this has to do with one of the co-founders, Agent of Chaos.

1008
01:03:28,720 --> 01:03:32,720
You might remember a couple weeks ago, we talked about how they actually got invited to Valve's headquarters and so forth,

1009
01:03:32,720 --> 01:03:39,720
and we were kind of joking, oh, sold out and all this stuff, which certainly the community was accusing them of.

1010
01:03:39,720 --> 01:03:44,720
But they said, quote, our goal wasn't to steer people away from Left 4 Dead 2,

1011
01:03:44,720 --> 01:03:48,720
it was to get Valve's attention and have them support Left 4 Dead.

1012
01:03:48,720 --> 01:03:55,720
So apparently, since they have continued to support Left 4 Dead with content, they have declared the boycott over.

1013
01:03:55,720 --> 01:03:57,720
Hmm, interesting.

1014
01:03:57,720 --> 01:03:59,720
But you know, the boycott was a little silly in the first place.

1015
01:03:59,720 --> 01:04:03,720
It's also mainly because they were worried that Left 4 Dead 2 was just going to be some add-on crap,

1016
01:04:03,720 --> 01:04:06,720
and it's not going to be that much of a game to stand alone by itself.

1017
01:04:06,720 --> 01:04:15,720
And they really have added a lot to Left 4 Dead 2 to really warrant it as another release, and not just add-on stuff.

1018
01:04:15,720 --> 01:04:19,720
Do you think they'll continue to support Left 4 Dead 1, even while Left 4 Dead 2 is out?

1019
01:04:19,720 --> 01:04:23,720
I mean, EverQuest 1 still got upgrade packs, and EverQuest 2 is out.

1020
01:04:23,720 --> 01:04:26,720
Maybe. I don't know. Maybe. You never know.

1021
01:04:26,720 --> 01:04:30,720
Well, you know, I never understood the boycott to begin with, so I can't say this is...

1022
01:04:30,720 --> 01:04:34,720
Well, actually, it is surprising. You don't usually hear about boycotts coming to an end.

1023
01:04:34,720 --> 01:04:37,720
You just hear about, come to my online petition and sign it.

1024
01:04:37,720 --> 01:04:44,720
So I guess I have to say, I haven't really heard that before, but it is kind of lol-tastic that those guys actually went out to Valve and now they're canceling their boycott.

1025
01:04:44,720 --> 01:04:46,720
But, you know, whatever.

1026
01:04:46,720 --> 01:04:49,720
It was a little bit of a silly boycott in the first place, I think.

1027
01:04:49,720 --> 01:04:53,720
So would we have this problem if the game came out like a year from now?

1028
01:04:53,720 --> 01:04:55,720
Probably not, because...

1029
01:04:55,720 --> 01:04:58,720
And what if they had never released any upgrades for Left 4 Dead?

1030
01:04:58,720 --> 01:05:04,720
You know, I kind of go back to the thing, like, what does Valve really owe you outside of the base game?

1031
01:05:04,720 --> 01:05:05,720
You know?

1032
01:05:05,720 --> 01:05:10,720
Look at Madden. I mean, they have a bunch of updates and stuff from Madden, and there's a new version that comes out every year.

1033
01:05:10,720 --> 01:05:16,720
I don't see why they need to owe them anything, just like Need for Speed or a lot of EA games.

1034
01:05:16,720 --> 01:05:21,720
Who cares? You know? You buy it or you don't buy it. That's it, you know?

1035
01:05:21,720 --> 01:05:24,720
And you'll bitch and moan about it all you want, but...

1036
01:05:24,720 --> 01:05:26,720
Post to the internet on your favorite forum.

1037
01:05:26,720 --> 01:05:29,720
Yeah, post to the internet. You know, complain that it's not President Cat.

1038
01:05:29,720 --> 01:05:35,720
And then, you know, you'll just buy it anyways, because you're consumer whore.

1039
01:05:35,720 --> 01:05:37,720
And how.

1040
01:05:37,720 --> 01:05:40,720
Alright, let's move on to another segment we love to do here on the program.

1041
01:05:40,720 --> 01:05:44,720
It is a segment we like to call the Classic Game of the Week.

1042
01:05:44,720 --> 01:05:50,720
It's a segment where Dark Soccer actually goes into the video game Vault and pulls out one of her favorite classic games and she says,

1043
01:05:50,720 --> 01:05:55,720
You know what, bitches? You should be playing this game right now.

1044
01:05:55,720 --> 01:05:59,720
So Dark Soccer, you've dived into the vault and you've picked out a game that you think everyone should be playing.

1045
01:05:59,720 --> 01:06:00,720
What game?

1046
01:06:00,720 --> 01:06:02,720
I died.

1047
01:06:02,720 --> 01:06:05,720
Fine, you swam. I don't know what you did. Whatever you did.

1048
01:06:05,720 --> 01:06:07,720
Um, the classic game is...

1049
01:06:07,720 --> 01:06:09,720
Dude, dude, dude, dude, dude your way in there.

1050
01:06:09,720 --> 01:06:12,720
Is Hexen.

1051
01:06:12,720 --> 01:06:15,720
Not Heretic, but Hexen.

1052
01:06:15,720 --> 01:06:19,720
And this is actually the best quality of the music I could find other than having them.

1053
01:06:19,720 --> 01:06:23,720
Punch. Smack. Chicken.

1054
01:06:23,720 --> 01:06:30,720
So yeah, Hexen is a first person shooter that was put up by Raven and published by ID.

1055
01:06:30,720 --> 01:06:33,720
I-B-E.

1056
01:06:33,720 --> 01:06:47,720
And it's actually the sequel to Heretic, however it has better points to it, which makes me really put it over the first one that came out.

1057
01:06:47,720 --> 01:06:57,720
There were PlayStation, Saturn, and N64 versions, but the N64 one was the only really good one that came out.

1058
01:06:57,720 --> 01:07:02,720
It was the best conversion. The Saturn and PlayStation ones actually had some...

1059
01:07:02,720 --> 01:07:05,720
They were only one player and had some frame rate losses.

1060
01:07:05,720 --> 01:07:18,720
So anyway, you are playing as Kronos who is going on and you actually can play as either a fighter, a cleric, or a mage.

1061
01:07:18,720 --> 01:07:34,720
And they have their own different weapons and the fighter is mainly a melee, the cleric has special weapons and healing effects and the mage has long range weapons and is also pretty damn fragile.

1062
01:07:34,720 --> 01:07:43,720
So it's first person. You go through these sprightly, fake 3D places and smite things.

1063
01:07:43,720 --> 01:07:45,720
It was Doom with Magic.

1064
01:07:45,720 --> 01:07:52,720
It was Doom with Magic. And actually Hexen uses the Doom engine. So you can jump. You can jump.

1065
01:07:52,720 --> 01:08:07,720
You also have a hub system of level progression and this one actually had, where the previous ones used on MIDI music, this one actually used full Redbook audio.

1066
01:08:07,720 --> 01:08:16,720
You've got moving walls in the game. So they actually had to modify Doom's engine.

1067
01:08:16,720 --> 01:08:24,720
Also, the source code was released in 2008 so now you can get Hexen for Linux, which is pretty good.

1068
01:08:24,720 --> 01:08:30,720
And also it's compatible with a lot of the Doom source ports.

1069
01:08:30,720 --> 01:08:41,720
There was an expansion pack called Death Kings of the Dark Citadel and it had 20 new levels and deathmatch levels.

1070
01:08:41,720 --> 01:08:50,720
And you actually had to either buy it in store or by mail order.

1071
01:08:50,720 --> 01:08:56,720
It's just a really good game. It actually had some of the best cheats ever in it.

1072
01:08:56,720 --> 01:09:01,720
The NRA code was all weapons.

1073
01:09:01,720 --> 01:09:04,720
You can turn yourself into a chicken.

1074
01:09:04,720 --> 01:09:06,720
Seriously, you can turn yourself into a chicken.

1075
01:09:06,720 --> 01:09:08,720
It's the anti-Zelda.

1076
01:09:08,720 --> 01:09:10,720
It was a fun game.

1077
01:09:10,720 --> 01:09:15,720
I know you usually don't like first person shooters because they make you sick because they're so realistic.

1078
01:09:15,720 --> 01:09:17,720
This was sprite based.

1079
01:09:17,720 --> 01:09:18,720
Yeah, sprite based isn't as bad.

1080
01:09:18,720 --> 01:09:22,720
It didn't really make me all that motion sick. I'd have to stop because I'd get headaches.

1081
01:09:22,720 --> 01:09:28,720
But it didn't really make me full on sick to my stomach, ready to throw up on the cat or anything.

1082
01:09:28,720 --> 01:09:33,720
Alright, there you go kids. Your classic game of the week, Hexen from id.

1083
01:09:33,720 --> 01:09:37,720
Which you can still get. In fact, someone in chat was saying they were just playing it earlier today.

1084
01:09:37,720 --> 01:09:42,720
Who was saying that? I just saw it in chat a minute ago.

1085
01:09:42,720 --> 01:09:44,720
Gosh, I'm behind on chat or something.

1086
01:09:44,720 --> 01:09:46,720
Sorry, somebody had said they were playing. Oh, there it is.

1087
01:09:46,720 --> 01:09:49,720
Frisbee says, I was just playing this online today through school tag.

1088
01:09:49,720 --> 01:09:52,720
So you can play it, I guess, online in different places.

1089
01:09:52,720 --> 01:09:55,720
So check it out.

1090
01:09:55,720 --> 01:09:58,720
Deathwishing, I guess, hasn't heard the chat on the show before.

1091
01:09:58,720 --> 01:10:02,720
Wants to know, how do you get sick from playing first person shooters?

1092
01:10:02,720 --> 01:10:05,720
It's called vertigo.

1093
01:10:05,720 --> 01:10:09,720
I have a friend at work who has that real bad too.

1094
01:10:09,720 --> 01:10:12,720
She can't get on boats or anything. It makes her very sick.

1095
01:10:12,720 --> 01:10:18,720
It's just, I really don't know what it is. It's something between the eye and inner ear, I guess.

1096
01:10:18,720 --> 01:10:27,720
But it's like, I guess, I think it's that your brain starts compensating for the motion that it sees.

1097
01:10:27,720 --> 01:10:33,720
When your body isn't feeling the same motion and it causes a conflict in your balance.

1098
01:10:33,720 --> 01:10:36,720
That just makes me sick right away.

1099
01:10:36,720 --> 01:10:40,720
Also, another thing that will do it to me is rendering errors.

1100
01:10:40,720 --> 01:10:45,720
You know, like when Sonic Adventure, when the Japanese version had all those bad rendering errors

1101
01:10:45,720 --> 01:10:50,720
and the collision detection wasn't bad and you could actually see through the wall at some points and see the edge.

1102
01:10:50,720 --> 01:10:53,720
It's like, I couldn't process it. It would just stop.

1103
01:10:53,720 --> 01:10:57,720
I would literally have to close my eyes because it would make my head hurt.

1104
01:10:57,720 --> 01:11:01,720
HungryMrKrunk in chat says, I can't play Spyro. I get sick.

1105
01:11:01,720 --> 01:11:05,720
Well, is that motion sickness or just because you're playing Spyro?

1106
01:11:05,720 --> 01:11:09,720
Brad from Paw Culture says, well, Vertigo, it's a good flick.

1107
01:11:09,720 --> 01:11:11,720
Vertigo, shoot.

1108
01:11:11,720 --> 01:11:13,720
It's a good movie, but...

1109
01:11:13,720 --> 01:11:20,720
I did know who did the opening credits for that, too, because we studied it in my typography or my graphic design class.

1110
01:11:20,720 --> 01:11:24,720
Because the opening titles to it were so amazing.

1111
01:11:24,720 --> 01:11:26,720
Wasn't it the same as Psycho?

1112
01:11:26,720 --> 01:11:27,720
I think it was Saul Bass.

1113
01:11:27,720 --> 01:11:33,720
Saul Bass is seriously the best movie title designer ever, but I digress.

1114
01:11:33,720 --> 01:11:36,720
Death Wishing just seems to think it's bad games that make you sick, but...

1115
01:11:36,720 --> 01:11:44,720
Well, GoldenEye, which is supposed to be one of the best N64 first person shooters, made me really sick.

1116
01:11:44,720 --> 01:11:48,720
I couldn't play Unreal.

1117
01:11:48,720 --> 01:11:52,720
I couldn't play Portal. Oh my god.

1118
01:11:52,720 --> 01:11:56,720
You want to see me just get so sick? Dan had to play through Portal for me.

1119
01:11:56,720 --> 01:11:58,720
I would tell him what to do.

1120
01:11:58,720 --> 01:11:59,720
So that you could look away and...

1121
01:11:59,720 --> 01:12:07,720
I would tell him how to pass, because I could easily see how to pass all of the puzzles and everything.

1122
01:12:07,720 --> 01:12:13,720
But I would literally have to tell him, because the moment that I held the controller in my hand and actually looked at the screen to do it,

1123
01:12:13,720 --> 01:12:16,720
I would be sick. Katamari does it. Katamari makes me really sick.

1124
01:12:16,720 --> 01:12:20,720
I can't play more than two levels before I get way too ill to keep playing.

1125
01:12:20,720 --> 01:12:21,720
That sucks.

1126
01:12:21,720 --> 01:12:24,720
Alright, well, hopefully they'll come out with an app for that.

1127
01:12:24,720 --> 01:12:26,720
I didn't do it on my iPhone.

1128
01:12:26,720 --> 01:12:28,720
Well, iPhone's so tiny.

1129
01:12:28,720 --> 01:12:29,720
I didn't get that sick on my iPhone.

1130
01:12:29,720 --> 01:12:30,720
You probably don't get as immersed there.

1131
01:12:30,720 --> 01:12:31,720
Yeah.

1132
01:12:31,720 --> 01:12:33,720
SGA-100 Matt does confirm it's Sawbass.

1133
01:12:33,720 --> 01:12:34,720
Yeah.

1134
01:12:34,720 --> 01:12:36,720
I knew it was Sawbass.

1135
01:12:36,720 --> 01:12:43,720
Alright, for anyone who ever wanted to know, I don't know if you do, but Sawbass is one of my designer heroes.

1136
01:12:43,720 --> 01:12:48,720
So, just go watch the opening credits for the man with the golden arm and you'll know.

1137
01:12:48,720 --> 01:12:49,720
Alright.

1138
01:12:49,720 --> 01:12:54,720
Well, that is going to bring this Part A of Orange Lounge Radio to a close, but don't go anywhere kids,

1139
01:12:54,720 --> 01:12:56,720
because we'll be right back with plenty more tonight in Part B.

1140
01:12:56,720 --> 01:13:01,720
We have our rapid fire news, talking about some news about Final Fantasy XI, Mass Effect 2, and so forth.

1141
01:13:01,720 --> 01:13:03,720
And then, of course, our long stories.

1142
01:13:03,720 --> 01:13:05,720
We're going to talk about people getting banned from Xbox and why.

1143
01:13:05,720 --> 01:13:09,720
More talk about a Wii HD and a new peripheral for the Wii.

1144
01:13:09,720 --> 01:13:13,720
That is all coming up in just a little bit here on Orange Lounge Radio.

1145
01:13:13,720 --> 01:13:15,720
So, we will be right back.

1146
01:13:15,720 --> 01:13:22,720
Stay tuned.

1147
01:13:22,720 --> 01:13:24,720
Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio.

1148
01:13:24,720 --> 01:13:32,720
Live on this lovely Sunday evening, October the 18th of 2009, where we are taping the 341st episode of our show.

1149
01:13:32,720 --> 01:13:35,720
And during the break, we heard some music there from DJ Hero.

1150
01:13:35,720 --> 01:13:37,720
You can only hear that live, sadly, because it is copyright.

1151
01:13:37,720 --> 01:13:39,720
We can't put it in the podcast.

1152
01:13:39,720 --> 01:13:41,720
Kind of like what we did last week, except this time it wasn't the demo.

1153
01:13:41,720 --> 01:13:42,720
It was the full game.

1154
01:13:42,720 --> 01:13:43,720
Yeah.

1155
01:13:43,720 --> 01:13:45,720
Paul Van Dyke, you were saying you had a favorite song already?

1156
01:13:45,720 --> 01:13:49,720
Yes, that Paul Van Dyke track, the one we played, was absolutely awesome.

1157
01:13:49,720 --> 01:13:53,720
They had a demo online, or a little clip online on their YouTube channel.

1158
01:13:53,720 --> 01:13:55,720
I just love that song.

1159
01:13:55,720 --> 01:13:57,720
I couldn't wait to play it, and it's really hard.

1160
01:13:57,720 --> 01:14:01,720
It has a lot of cross-fading in there, and it's really hard.

1161
01:14:01,720 --> 01:14:06,720
I was actually able to listen on the iPhone app for All Games.

1162
01:14:06,720 --> 01:14:09,720
Which, by the way, if you own an iPhone and you don't have this app, it's awesome.

1163
01:14:09,720 --> 01:14:14,720
You should check it out at All Games' website, or just look for it in the store.

1164
01:14:14,720 --> 01:14:20,720
It's an application where you can actually just play All Games Radio without needing any other type of tuner program or anything.

1165
01:14:20,720 --> 01:14:21,720
It's amazing.

1166
01:14:21,720 --> 01:14:22,720
Noelle's is amazing?

1167
01:14:22,720 --> 01:14:23,720
What?

1168
01:14:23,720 --> 01:14:24,720
Chicken.

1169
01:14:24,720 --> 01:14:25,720
Chicken is amazing.

1170
01:14:25,720 --> 01:14:27,720
Are you enjoying the Kentucky Fried Chicken that I went and got on Parade?

1171
01:14:27,720 --> 01:14:28,720
Yes, thank you.

1172
01:14:28,720 --> 01:14:31,720
You know, I could have, you know, I forgot.

1173
01:14:31,720 --> 01:14:35,720
I could just have that autoplay, like the actual tracks I wanted, so they'd be flawless.

1174
01:14:35,720 --> 01:14:36,720
But it's more fun to play.

1175
01:14:36,720 --> 01:14:38,720
Yeah, it's more fun to play it.

1176
01:14:38,720 --> 01:14:48,720
Folks, we have breaking news here at Orange Lounge Radio.

1177
01:14:48,720 --> 01:14:50,720
We have breaking news developing right now.

1178
01:14:50,720 --> 01:14:59,720
The folks at Rina We, the president cat game that we were laughing hysterically at in Part A, they have responded on their Twitter.

1179
01:14:59,720 --> 01:15:04,720
And boy have they ever, I don't think they know what the hell is going on right now.

1180
01:15:04,720 --> 01:15:10,720
They responded to some, one of our listeners, Technicolor, who tweeted our message that said, please release this game in the USA.

1181
01:15:10,720 --> 01:15:11,720
They said, really?

1182
01:15:11,720 --> 01:15:12,720
I'm so excited.

1183
01:15:12,720 --> 01:15:13,720
Is this spam?

1184
01:15:13,720 --> 01:15:15,720
So, A, we know they speak English.

1185
01:15:15,720 --> 01:15:18,720
Even though they've been tweeting in Japanese, somebody over there speaks English.

1186
01:15:18,720 --> 01:15:21,720
And then they tweeted us and some other listeners, can I ask one question?

1187
01:15:21,720 --> 01:15:22,720
How do you know this game?

1188
01:15:22,720 --> 01:15:25,720
And I think somebody said back to them that they were hearing it here on Orange Lounge Radio.

1189
01:15:25,720 --> 01:15:27,720
They tweeted back, oh my goodness, really?

1190
01:15:27,720 --> 01:15:29,720
Thank you so much.

1191
01:15:29,720 --> 01:15:31,720
I'm talking about this with coworkers right now.

1192
01:15:31,720 --> 01:15:33,720
They are all excited.

1193
01:15:33,720 --> 01:15:36,720
If this information on some website, let me know the URL.

1194
01:15:36,720 --> 01:15:37,720
Please retweet.

1195
01:15:37,720 --> 01:15:42,720
And they've been corresponding with one of our listeners on Twitter, Edmund Lu, I guess, has been helping them out.

1196
01:15:42,720 --> 01:15:50,720
And they told them that we were getting it from playasia.com, the release dates, which is where I read the Japanese release dates from.

1197
01:15:50,720 --> 01:15:53,720
And they responded, thank you so much.

1198
01:15:53,720 --> 01:15:56,720
And they retweeted so that all their followers could see it.

1199
01:15:56,720 --> 01:16:00,720
OLR talked about it on their radio show, and it really looks like an interesting game to play.

1200
01:16:00,720 --> 01:16:03,720
And then they said, thanks, is this popular in the USA?

1201
01:16:03,720 --> 01:16:04,720
Sorry for many questions.

1202
01:16:04,720 --> 01:16:15,720
So in the scope of just that time that Loki was playing DJ Hero during the break, they've tweeted six times about this President Cat takes over the USA tonight, Life on Orange Lounge Radio thing going on.

1203
01:16:15,720 --> 01:16:23,720
I also replied to that last thing saying that, yeah, some gamers like that kind of thing, stuff other than the sports and the typical RPG.

1204
01:16:23,720 --> 01:16:26,720
And that I personally love those kinds of games.

1205
01:16:26,720 --> 01:16:32,720
Oh, less than a minute ago, they have responded to one of my tweets because I wrote them back saying,

1206
01:16:32,720 --> 01:16:37,720
we found it on our weekly Japanese release date reading and think we need more lolcat inspired games.

1207
01:16:37,720 --> 01:16:39,720
How can we help get game in USA?

1208
01:16:39,720 --> 01:16:42,720
I said, it's not popular yet, but we think if it was released here, that it just might be.

1209
01:16:42,720 --> 01:16:45,720
There are many piano playing cat loving people here.

1210
01:16:45,720 --> 01:16:50,720
And they just said, you mean game in English? Retweet.

1211
01:16:50,720 --> 01:16:54,720
Okay, so I'm going to respond, yes, basically.

1212
01:16:54,720 --> 01:16:57,720
Yes, game in English.

1213
01:17:04,720 --> 01:17:06,720
Okay, so sorry for the dead air. So I'm tweeting back right now.

1214
01:17:06,720 --> 01:17:09,720
Yes, game in English and playable on our American Wiis.

1215
01:17:09,720 --> 01:17:13,720
And somebody in the chat room is like shouting, get them on the show, get them on the show.

1216
01:17:13,720 --> 01:17:17,720
I don't know if Japan can call our 800 numbers.

1217
01:17:17,720 --> 01:17:24,720
We have a friend that lives in Japan who is currently, you know, Julie.

1218
01:17:24,720 --> 01:17:25,720
Yeah.

1219
01:17:25,720 --> 01:17:26,720
Julie is in Japan right now.

1220
01:17:26,720 --> 01:17:27,720
Well, could we get...

1221
01:17:27,720 --> 01:17:30,720
Julie is with Krista. Krista speaks fluent Japanese.

1222
01:17:30,720 --> 01:17:33,720
I wonder if we can get them on Skype or something. I don't know.

1223
01:17:33,720 --> 01:17:37,720
I'll tell them, they added us back so I can direct message them. So I'll tell them to email me.

1224
01:17:37,720 --> 01:17:41,720
I don't want to do anything tonight because it's all panning out too fast, but we'll try to get them on a future show.

1225
01:17:41,720 --> 01:17:43,720
I am going to love this.

1226
01:17:43,720 --> 01:17:48,720
AlphaCananagram in chat says, this is one kick-ass episode of OLR.

1227
01:17:48,720 --> 01:17:54,720
Let me put it this way, okay? There's many companies out there like Tomo, well not necessarily Tomo,

1228
01:17:54,720 --> 01:17:59,720
but was it UFO Interactive Games and stuff like that, they port really obscure shit.

1229
01:17:59,720 --> 01:18:08,720
I mean, just really obscure Japanese RPGs or not even Japanese RPGs, like Japanese shooters and just weird games, you know, for budget prices.

1230
01:18:08,720 --> 01:18:14,720
One of these companies could easily pick this game up. It's just, you know, whether they think they can actually sell some copies of it.

1231
01:18:14,720 --> 01:18:19,720
They just tweeted it again. And keep in mind, it's like noon in Japan on a Monday morning right now, right?

1232
01:18:19,720 --> 01:18:21,720
Because they're up across on the other side of the date lines. It's probably about noon right there.

1233
01:18:21,720 --> 01:18:27,720
And they just tweeted again, great people, awesome. And they put at OLR, there are many piano playing cat loving people,

1234
01:18:27,720 --> 01:18:34,720
because that's what I said to them. So this is amazing. So we're going to correspond with them.

1235
01:18:34,720 --> 01:18:40,720
They could do like a viral advertisement or whatever with keyboard cat. I think they could have something, you know?

1236
01:18:40,720 --> 01:18:46,720
They could get the whole main loving people. Especially if the price is right, you know?

1237
01:18:46,720 --> 01:18:52,720
Okay, so we may need your friend in Japan to somehow get a hold of these people and talk to them in Japanese.

1238
01:18:52,720 --> 01:18:57,720
I don't know if we can make that happen, but I want them on the show. This needs to happen.

1239
01:18:57,720 --> 01:19:04,720
They love us. We love what they're doing. We are going to get this game released in the USA. And dammit, it all started right here tonight.

1240
01:19:04,720 --> 01:19:06,720
Let me see if she's online.

1241
01:19:06,720 --> 01:19:13,720
Alright, anyhow. Anyhow, I don't know what we have to do. If we're going to have to do one of those silly online petitions or what.

1242
01:19:13,720 --> 01:19:19,720
But meanwhile, we have a show to do. We got to get to Twitter topics. Here's the thing, I am not prepared for Twitter topics,

1243
01:19:19,720 --> 01:19:22,720
because usually I can just click on the at OLR messages and they're all right there.

1244
01:19:22,720 --> 01:19:27,720
But tonight, because of President Cat, our Twitter is full, so I need to go back a little bit.

1245
01:19:27,720 --> 01:19:30,720
I'm going to mix things up a little. Why not? It's one of those nights.

1246
01:19:30,720 --> 01:19:34,720
I think we should put a post on the front page about, you know, bring President Cat to the US.

1247
01:19:34,720 --> 01:19:36,720
I mean, that would be awesome.

1248
01:19:36,720 --> 01:19:43,720
We'll figure something out. Absolutely. Maybe we can get some of our friends and Game Ballers involved.

1249
01:19:43,720 --> 01:19:49,720
I don't know what we can do. We'll figure it out. All I know is that all unfolding live here on Sunday night might be a bit much.

1250
01:19:49,720 --> 01:19:56,720
So, we're going to get into some Twitter, not Twitter topics, I'm sorry, fast news. Loki's going to cover some quick news stories for us.

1251
01:19:56,720 --> 01:20:05,720
Yes. Okay, so Final Fantasy XI The Ultimate Collection, not the first collection that they released on PC, but probably the last,

1252
01:20:05,720 --> 01:20:12,720
will be coming out, of course, for $20 soon. November 10th is the date that's coming out.

1253
01:20:12,720 --> 01:20:22,720
And actually, that will be coming out on 360 as well. And as you might expect, it's basically the game plus all the downloadable expansions and whatnot.

1254
01:20:22,720 --> 01:20:27,720
For $20, it's not a bad price at all, especially if you're looking to get into Final Fantasy XI.

1255
01:20:27,720 --> 01:20:35,720
Although, at this point, I would wonder why you wouldn't just wait for Final Fantasy XIV, but hey, to each their own and $20 is very cheap.

1256
01:20:35,720 --> 01:20:47,720
Also, Zen Studios, the creators of such wonderful games like Zen Pinball, Pinball FX, and The Punisher of No Mercy, are releasing a brand new game to the PlayStation Network called Planet Mini Golf.

1257
01:20:47,720 --> 01:20:59,720
It is going to be a game featuring 144 mini golf holes with several exhilarating courses around the world, they say, complete with crazy obstacles and six customizable characters.

1258
01:20:59,720 --> 01:21:04,720
And it looks pretty sweet. I love me some mini golf games.

1259
01:21:04,720 --> 01:21:14,720
Finally, as rumored, Sony is releasing a 250GB PlayStation 3 slim model over here in the US as well.

1260
01:21:14,720 --> 01:21:24,720
It is coming standalone, no packing games with that, and only for $50 more than the 120GB system, so $349.99 will be the price on that.

1261
01:21:24,720 --> 01:21:30,720
Which is not a bad deal if you're looking to really pack a lot of crap onto your PlayStation 3 hard drive.

1262
01:21:30,720 --> 01:21:36,720
So that will be coming out around November 3rd.

1263
01:21:36,720 --> 01:21:42,720
Alright, sorry, they wrote back again. I hate to keep going back to this, but I'm loving this.

1264
01:21:42,720 --> 01:21:48,720
They're asking their boss right now. They put, wow, ask my boss, haha, wait a minute please.

1265
01:21:48,720 --> 01:21:54,720
And retweeted our message about, yes, game in English and playable on our American Wiis, how can we help make this happen?

1266
01:21:54,720 --> 01:22:02,720
So, some executive at some Japanese game company right now is hearing about some crappy little internet show in America that wants this damn game.

1267
01:22:02,720 --> 01:22:04,720
Dude, totally want President Cat.

1268
01:22:04,720 --> 01:22:06,720
Amazing. I love the internet.

1269
01:22:06,720 --> 01:22:10,720
And hey, you know, maybe if all its fellows will just send us a Japanese Wii in the game.

1270
01:22:10,720 --> 01:22:15,720
Just put it on WiiWare. I mean, honestly, it can't be that big of a game. I mean, just put it on WiiWare.

1271
01:22:15,720 --> 01:22:16,720
President Cat!

1272
01:22:16,720 --> 01:22:23,720
Alright, well, when Twitter ladies, bosses, or guys, I don't know who it is, but when that boss gets back to them, we will have more.

1273
01:22:23,720 --> 01:22:27,720
Meantime, more late-breaking, well, not late-breaking, but rapid-fire news anyway.

1274
01:22:27,720 --> 01:22:33,720
News about Super Mario Bros. Wii, the new one coming out. Did you know Princess Peach is not playable in the game?

1275
01:22:33,720 --> 01:22:38,720
Actually, this was brought up recently in an interview with Miyamoto, and Miyamoto commented,

1276
01:22:38,720 --> 01:22:44,720
quote, I thought it'd be nice to have her as a playable character, but the Toad characters have a similar physique to a Mario character than Peach does.

1277
01:22:44,720 --> 01:22:52,720
And if one of the four had a dress, we'd have to come up with a special programming to handle how the skirt is handled in the gameplay, and that's really the only reason why Peach isn't playable.

1278
01:22:52,720 --> 01:22:56,720
Of course, if we had Wario in there, we'd have to program a way to make him fart.

1279
01:22:56,720 --> 01:23:05,720
Is that maybe a throwback to the fact that people in Super Smash Bros. Melee were just pausing the game to do upskirt cams on Princess Peach and Daisy? I don't know.

1280
01:23:05,720 --> 01:23:10,720
But regardless, it sounds like they're trying to skirt the issue. Her, her.

1281
01:23:10,720 --> 01:23:17,720
Mass Effect 2 now has a release date. It's coming out in North America on January 26th, and it's coming out in Europe on the 29th.

1282
01:23:17,720 --> 01:23:25,720
Is there really anything else you need to know? Well, you might want to know about the GameStop pre-order bonus that they're advertising, including Terminus Armor.

1283
01:23:25,720 --> 01:23:31,720
It will increase the run speed and personal shields, and augmenting weapons with an additional magazine of reserve ammo.

1284
01:23:31,720 --> 01:23:39,720
And then the M90 Blackstorm Heavy Weapon will generate a high-powered localized gravity well, accelerating particles to near-infinite mass.

1285
01:23:39,720 --> 01:23:45,720
So there you go, some pre-order bonuses for Mass Effect 2, officially dated for January, both North America and Europe.

1286
01:23:45,720 --> 01:23:56,720
Duels of the Planeswalker gets a new expansion on Xbox 360. They think the name is Duel of the Dragons, but it is being priced only 400 Microsoft points.

1287
01:23:56,720 --> 01:24:04,720
It is coming out on the 21st of October. It's going to add three playable decks and three unlockable cards for all of the original decks.

1288
01:24:04,720 --> 01:24:10,720
So there you go, some new expansions coming to Magic the Gathering, which hopefully you didn't forget was out there on the Wii.

1289
01:24:10,720 --> 01:24:18,720
Let's do Jamie's Stories. We never did our closed deck tournament, Rob. We never did, we need to.

1290
01:24:18,720 --> 01:24:24,720
Well, how about some news about Alpha Protocol, which actually really isn't very much news because I think we expected it.

1291
01:24:24,720 --> 01:24:31,720
It is delayed instead of being out, even for Christmas, they're pushing it back to Spring 2010.

1292
01:24:31,720 --> 01:24:41,720
But Obsidian, the developer, is actually pretty happy about that because it gives them more time to make sure it's really polished and looking the way that they want it to.

1293
01:24:41,720 --> 01:24:48,720
So I think that's a good thing. I would rather wait for a good product than have to deal with substandard.

1294
01:24:48,720 --> 01:24:53,720
Yeah, delays aren't always a bad thing. Delays can sometimes end out pretty good.

1295
01:24:53,720 --> 01:25:06,720
Also, two characters for Tatsunoko vs. Capcom have been released. We have Condor Nojo as Joe the Condor from Gatchaman.

1296
01:25:06,720 --> 01:25:10,720
He was G2, the one who always wanted to fire the bird missile.

1297
01:25:10,720 --> 01:25:18,720
Also, just to say, for anyone who watched Battle of the Planets, it was Jason. He was Dirk in G-Force.

1298
01:25:18,720 --> 01:25:23,720
Anyway, I'm the Gatchaman fangirl, so I'm very happy about this.

1299
01:25:23,720 --> 01:25:31,720
And then there's also Zero. Zero is going to be out, as in Zero from the Mega Man X series.

1300
01:25:31,720 --> 01:25:34,720
So that's going to be pretty sweet.

1301
01:25:34,720 --> 01:25:41,720
I actually watched videos of them in motion and it was epic.

1302
01:25:41,720 --> 01:25:53,720
Also, the team up with... they had Joe and Jun on one of the matches I saw and they did the Tatsumaki attack.

1303
01:25:53,720 --> 01:25:57,720
That was pretty cool. That was pretty damn cool. I'm looking so forward to this.

1304
01:25:57,720 --> 01:26:00,720
Except I really don't like what they did with the Tatsunoko logo in English.

1305
01:26:00,720 --> 01:26:06,720
It doesn't look nice. They should have just stuck to the Japanese one.

1306
01:26:06,720 --> 01:26:13,720
And, last but definitely not least, Blur is going to be in LEGO Rock Band.

1307
01:26:13,720 --> 01:26:27,720
And there are little blur-shaped, you know, LEGO stick people all bricked out for LEGO Rock Band, so that makes me pretty happy.

1308
01:26:27,720 --> 01:26:35,720
I'm just sort of laughing at the little Damon and the little Graham. I think that's pretty funny.

1309
01:26:35,720 --> 01:26:39,720
That's just cute. But that's it.

1310
01:26:39,720 --> 01:26:45,720
Alright. Moving on, we're going to get into some Twitter topics. You guys ready to do Twitter?

1311
01:26:45,720 --> 01:26:49,720
I know we had a lot of Twitter tonight with what the developments were present in CAT,

1312
01:26:49,720 --> 01:26:54,720
which apparently they just posted some type of comic that has our chat room in stitches right now.

1313
01:26:54,720 --> 01:27:00,720
I'm loving this. I mean, live radio doesn't... I'm serious. We should petition this stuff.

1314
01:27:00,720 --> 01:27:04,720
We should send it all out, you know, tell people why this game needs to come over here.

1315
01:27:04,720 --> 01:27:06,720
Well, let's wait and see how they respond.

1316
01:27:06,720 --> 01:27:08,720
I can actually read some of this.

1317
01:27:08,720 --> 01:27:13,720
Alright. Anyhow, I'm sorry. I didn't mean for President CAT to take over the show, but goddamn.

1318
01:27:13,720 --> 01:27:16,720
This is cute.

1319
01:27:16,720 --> 01:27:22,720
O-L-R-0, President CAT 1. Let's just face it. President CAT is the fourth host tonight.

1320
01:27:22,720 --> 01:27:27,720
Alright. Twitter topics, dammit. Things that don't involve President CAT, believe it or not.

1321
01:27:27,720 --> 01:27:30,720
Questions when our tweeters give us stuff at O-L-R.

1322
01:27:30,720 --> 01:27:35,720
Deekman wants me to remind you all, you can now post pictures to the photo stream.

1323
01:27:35,720 --> 01:27:39,720
So if you send a picture to pics at orangelaungeradio.com,

1324
01:27:39,720 --> 01:27:44,720
it will now go to our website at www.orangelaungeradio.com,

1325
01:27:44,720 --> 01:27:47,720
and it'll be right up there for everyone to see.

1326
01:27:47,720 --> 01:27:51,720
So don't send pictures of penises, or I swear to God, we'll remove this like that.

1327
01:27:51,720 --> 01:27:53,720
But if you have, like, gaming stuff you want to put,

1328
01:27:53,720 --> 01:27:59,720
or maybe it's a challenge this week to show our love for President CAT,

1329
01:27:59,720 --> 01:28:02,720
you need to upload pictures. In fact, who should give a challenge to the listeners every week?

1330
01:28:02,720 --> 01:28:03,720
I love this idea.

1331
01:28:03,720 --> 01:28:06,720
Since President CAT has taken over the show tonight,

1332
01:28:06,720 --> 01:28:10,720
we want people to upload pictures to the stream showing their love for President CAT,

1333
01:28:10,720 --> 01:28:14,720
because this will help the developers show that they are the next big thing in the U.S.

1334
01:28:14,720 --> 01:28:16,720
Let's make that happen.

1335
01:28:16,720 --> 01:28:22,720
Alright. I can't fight the adornment of this. It's too cute.

1336
01:28:22,720 --> 01:28:27,720
It really is. Like, the podcast listeners who aren't in chat and can't see all these URLs tonight

1337
01:28:27,720 --> 01:28:31,720
are like, you've got to be smoking crack. But, like, seriously, look at the website.

1338
01:28:31,720 --> 01:28:33,720
It is cute overload.

1339
01:28:33,720 --> 01:28:37,720
I hope they don't think that I actually know more Japanese than what I just posted to them.

1340
01:28:37,720 --> 01:28:42,720
I just said it was funny.

1341
01:28:42,720 --> 01:28:45,720
Alright. Anyhow, other Twitter topics going on.

1342
01:28:45,720 --> 01:28:50,720
Oh, shoot. I somehow accidentally clicked on an ad.

1343
01:28:50,720 --> 01:28:52,720
And now I've got to, oh, man.

1344
01:28:52,720 --> 01:28:53,720
No.

1345
01:28:53,720 --> 01:28:55,720
Now I've got to get the stories up again.

1346
01:28:55,720 --> 01:28:57,720
I'm going to fail.

1347
01:28:57,720 --> 01:29:02,720
Ryan Belknap wants to know, what do you guys think of Glee and Flash Forward?

1348
01:29:02,720 --> 01:29:05,720
I love Glee. I think that show is amazing.

1349
01:29:05,720 --> 01:29:09,720
Flash Forward, I watched the first episode, but wasn't able to watch anything after that.

1350
01:29:09,720 --> 01:29:12,720
I just haven't had time, because I've been watching a bunch of other shows.

1351
01:29:12,720 --> 01:29:15,720
My wife watches Glee. I've watched a few episodes of Glee.

1352
01:29:15,720 --> 01:29:20,720
It's okay. I just, you know, during the week with so much stuff that I'm watching on TV,

1353
01:29:20,720 --> 01:29:24,720
I try to get time to work on the cabinet and stuff.

1354
01:29:24,720 --> 01:29:26,720
And I normally skip out on that show.

1355
01:29:26,720 --> 01:29:28,720
But it's entertaining.

1356
01:29:28,720 --> 01:29:33,720
And my wife is excited at the fact that they're going to be going on tour.

1357
01:29:33,720 --> 01:29:35,720
So she wants to go see that.

1358
01:29:35,720 --> 01:29:37,720
Did that get officially announced?

1359
01:29:37,720 --> 01:29:39,720
I don't know. I want to see it too if it goes on tour.

1360
01:29:39,720 --> 01:29:41,720
I'll take your wife if you don't want to go.

1361
01:29:41,720 --> 01:29:46,720
And then, also, Flash Forward I've actually watched.

1362
01:29:46,720 --> 01:29:49,720
It's good, but it's slow. That's the only problem.

1363
01:29:49,720 --> 01:29:51,720
But it is getting interesting.

1364
01:29:51,720 --> 01:29:53,720
But it is very slow.

1365
01:29:53,720 --> 01:29:55,720
It's better. But I watch them both.

1366
01:29:55,720 --> 01:29:57,720
It's by the people who do the 4400.

1367
01:29:57,720 --> 01:29:59,720
But you know what I haven't been watching, though?

1368
01:29:59,720 --> 01:30:01,720
And I hear it's actually good this season?

1369
01:30:01,720 --> 01:30:02,720
Heroes.

1370
01:30:02,720 --> 01:30:04,720
Really? And I stopped watching it, too.

1371
01:30:04,720 --> 01:30:06,720
Because I'm watching House. Because House is on the same time.

1372
01:30:06,720 --> 01:30:08,720
I'm sorry. House wins.

1373
01:30:08,720 --> 01:30:11,720
Can I say, though, I got introduced to It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia the other day.

1374
01:30:11,720 --> 01:30:16,720
Oh my god. That show is fucking funny. Oh my god, that show is funny.

1375
01:30:16,720 --> 01:30:18,720
I've really been, like, kind of...

1376
01:30:18,720 --> 01:30:20,720
I don't watch that show regularly.

1377
01:30:20,720 --> 01:30:24,720
We were actually killing time between, like, a show and South Park or something.

1378
01:30:24,720 --> 01:30:27,720
So we turned it on. I'm like, I forgot how funny this show is.

1379
01:30:27,720 --> 01:30:29,720
It's just hilarious.

1380
01:30:29,720 --> 01:30:32,720
And Chat Room reminded me that a couple of people in Chat are saying,

1381
01:30:32,720 --> 01:30:34,720
Don't forget V starts in a couple weeks.

1382
01:30:34,720 --> 01:30:36,720
Oh my god!

1383
01:30:36,720 --> 01:30:40,720
I have two words for you. Fuck yes.

1384
01:30:40,720 --> 01:30:42,720
No, you don't know how giddy this makes me.

1385
01:30:42,720 --> 01:30:45,720
You've talked about V, like, five years ago on the show.

1386
01:30:45,720 --> 01:30:47,720
You've talked about it for a very long time. I know you love V.

1387
01:30:47,720 --> 01:30:50,720
And you remember when that book came out, how I read the whole thing?

1388
01:30:50,720 --> 01:30:51,720
Mm-hmm.

1389
01:30:51,720 --> 01:30:52,720
Like, right here on the show?

1390
01:30:52,720 --> 01:30:53,720
During the show? Yeah, I know.

1391
01:30:53,720 --> 01:30:54,720
That book was...

1392
01:30:54,720 --> 01:30:56,720
I was like, Jamie, time to do the story. What, V?

1393
01:30:56,720 --> 01:30:57,720
I'm like, fuck you, V.

1394
01:30:57,720 --> 01:31:00,720
No, that was epic. That was epic.

1395
01:31:00,720 --> 01:31:03,720
So I'm looking forward to V.

1396
01:31:03,720 --> 01:31:04,720
Spazinator wants to know,

1397
01:31:04,720 --> 01:31:07,720
How about the apparent leak by Naughty Dog on the official PS boards

1398
01:31:07,720 --> 01:31:11,720
regarding cross-game chat coming to the PS3 in Firmware 3.1?

1399
01:31:11,720 --> 01:31:14,720
Well, you kind of summed it up right there what the news story is,

1400
01:31:14,720 --> 01:31:16,720
and all I have to say is I hope so.

1401
01:31:16,720 --> 01:31:19,720
Sadly, as much as I've said nice things about Sony tonight,

1402
01:31:19,720 --> 01:31:24,720
I think that they're still lagging big time in the online war.

1403
01:31:24,720 --> 01:31:27,720
But they're free, so I guess you get what you pay for,

1404
01:31:27,720 --> 01:31:28,720
but this would be nice.

1405
01:31:28,720 --> 01:31:29,720
It's certainly a nice feature.

1406
01:31:29,720 --> 01:31:32,720
I mean, of course it would be. Yeah.

1407
01:31:32,720 --> 01:31:33,720
Let's see.

1408
01:31:33,720 --> 01:31:34,720
Gamer Girl asks,

1409
01:31:34,720 --> 01:31:36,720
What's the most fun game you've ever played?

1410
01:31:36,720 --> 01:31:40,720
Like, so fun that when it's over you'd play it a million times no matter what.

1411
01:31:40,720 --> 01:31:43,720
Oh, my gosh.

1412
01:31:43,720 --> 01:31:47,720
I don't know if I want to go like 8-bit or like newer stuff.

1413
01:31:47,720 --> 01:31:49,720
I can always play the Guardian Legends.

1414
01:31:49,720 --> 01:31:51,720
You know I talk about that game very fondly on the show,

1415
01:31:51,720 --> 01:31:52,720
and I love that game.

1416
01:31:52,720 --> 01:31:54,720
I can always go back to that.

1417
01:31:54,720 --> 01:31:57,720
If you want to go to a true 80s arcade classic, Dig Dug.

1418
01:31:57,720 --> 01:31:58,720
I can never stop playing Dig Dug.

1419
01:31:58,720 --> 01:31:59,720
Peggle.

1420
01:31:59,720 --> 01:32:00,720
Peggle.

1421
01:32:00,720 --> 01:32:01,720
Seriously.

1422
01:32:01,720 --> 01:32:06,720
No, it's like whenever anything happens and I have to wait for anything,

1423
01:32:06,720 --> 01:32:07,720
I'm like Peggle.

1424
01:32:07,720 --> 01:32:09,720
Seriously, it's all Peggle for me right now.

1425
01:32:09,720 --> 01:32:11,720
Mr. Dew.

1426
01:32:11,720 --> 01:32:15,720
Mr. Dew is Snow Brothers.

1427
01:32:15,720 --> 01:32:17,720
And soon, President Cat.

1428
01:32:17,720 --> 01:32:19,720
Mr. Dew is rad.

1429
01:32:19,720 --> 01:32:21,720
Redertainment asks,

1430
01:32:21,720 --> 01:32:23,720
I have a big pile of strategy guides I want to get rid of.

1431
01:32:23,720 --> 01:32:26,720
Suggestions?

1432
01:32:26,720 --> 01:32:31,720
If you have the versus Final Fantasy 7 one and it still has the poster in it

1433
01:32:31,720 --> 01:32:33,720
and it's intact, give it to me.

1434
01:32:33,720 --> 01:32:35,720
Also, winner is coming.

1435
01:32:35,720 --> 01:32:37,720
Because I don't want to pay $100 for it on eBay.

1436
01:32:37,720 --> 01:32:39,720
I had that poster, but my drunk girlfriend kicked it

1437
01:32:39,720 --> 01:32:42,720
and it accidentally ripped.

1438
01:32:42,720 --> 01:32:44,720
I had the strategy guide and poster and everything

1439
01:32:44,720 --> 01:32:48,720
and Dan's friend ripped the cover and drew on it.

1440
01:32:48,720 --> 01:32:49,720
It was a long time ago.

1441
01:32:49,720 --> 01:32:50,720
I'm pissed off.

1442
01:32:50,720 --> 01:32:53,720
That particular strategy guide goes for a lot of money on eBay.

1443
01:32:53,720 --> 01:32:55,720
Seriously.

1444
01:32:55,720 --> 01:32:57,720
The versus books Final Fantasy 7 one.

1445
01:32:57,720 --> 01:32:59,720
Rina, we just responded to you, Jamie.

1446
01:32:59,720 --> 01:33:00,720
Oh, Lord.

1447
01:33:00,720 --> 01:33:02,720
She's busy tonight.

1448
01:33:02,720 --> 01:33:03,720
Sorry.

1449
01:33:03,720 --> 01:33:05,720
It's taking over Twitter tonight.

1450
01:33:05,720 --> 01:33:07,720
I can't help it.

1451
01:33:07,720 --> 01:33:09,720
Anyway, that's going to do it for Twitter topics tonight.

1452
01:33:09,720 --> 01:33:11,720
Sorry if you guys didn't get through.

1453
01:33:11,720 --> 01:33:12,720
Don't forget, you can always send us an email.

1454
01:33:12,720 --> 01:33:14,720
Mailbag at OrangeLawnsRadio.com

1455
01:33:14,720 --> 01:33:17,720
and if you're really upset your tweet didn't get through,

1456
01:33:17,720 --> 01:33:21,720
blame President Cat because that's been monopolizing our Twitter discussion this evening.

1457
01:33:21,720 --> 01:33:22,720
I love it.

1458
01:33:22,720 --> 01:33:24,720
It's got a cat licking its nose.

1459
01:33:24,720 --> 01:33:26,720
It's so cute.

1460
01:33:26,720 --> 01:33:27,720
Exactly.

1461
01:33:27,720 --> 01:33:29,720
How about some other gaming news?

1462
01:33:29,720 --> 01:33:31,720
Loki.

1463
01:33:31,720 --> 01:33:33,720
I don't know if I could do any more gaming news.

1464
01:33:33,720 --> 01:33:36,720
It just feels so insignificant compared to President Cat.

1465
01:33:36,720 --> 01:33:38,720
But anyways, we'll move on.

1466
01:33:38,720 --> 01:33:45,720
So apparently people are getting banned for playing pirated copies of Forza and Borderlands.

1467
01:33:45,720 --> 01:33:47,720
Really?

1468
01:33:47,720 --> 01:33:54,720
Is that a shock to you that playing games that you've burned early is going to get you banned off Xbox Live?

1469
01:33:54,720 --> 01:33:56,720
But yeah, that's the case.

1470
01:33:56,720 --> 01:34:00,720
So apparently if you are going to go the illegal route with Forza Motorsport 3 and Borderlands,

1471
01:34:00,720 --> 01:34:02,720
you might want to wait until the game comes out.

1472
01:34:02,720 --> 01:34:11,720
Ironically though, you're going to get banned, but only your live account is going to get banned,

1473
01:34:11,720 --> 01:34:14,720
not your console because they still want you to buy games apparently.

1474
01:34:14,720 --> 01:34:16,720
But you can always create a new live account.

1475
01:34:16,720 --> 01:34:20,720
Or if you're really going to play this that early, just play it offline.

1476
01:34:20,720 --> 01:34:23,720
Or play it on a banned console.

1477
01:34:23,720 --> 01:34:28,720
I heard though they banned the account and not the console.

1478
01:34:28,720 --> 01:34:29,720
Yeah, the account.

1479
01:34:29,720 --> 01:34:33,720
In some way they knew whether you're playing a legit game or not.

1480
01:34:33,720 --> 01:34:39,720
I almost picked up Borderlands early too, but I figured I wouldn't get to it because I'd be playing DJ Hero.

1481
01:34:39,720 --> 01:34:41,720
And that's really what's going to happen.

1482
01:34:41,720 --> 01:34:45,720
I'm going to wait for Borderlands to come out because I don't know when I'm going to get to it.

1483
01:34:45,720 --> 01:34:52,720
And really that's the last game I'm buying this year, so I'm all set for the rest of the holiday.

1484
01:34:52,720 --> 01:34:58,720
I'll just cozy up, no fire, but I'll cozy up in my warm house and DJ Hero and Borderlands.

1485
01:34:58,720 --> 01:35:02,720
How though, because they say that you're not going to get banned if you have it legitimately,

1486
01:35:02,720 --> 01:35:04,720
but seriously, how do they know the difference?

1487
01:35:04,720 --> 01:35:07,720
I don't know.

1488
01:35:07,720 --> 01:35:11,720
But a lot of people are probably going to be surprised when that fall update rolls around.

1489
01:35:11,720 --> 01:35:14,720
Everyone playing burned copies of stuff.

1490
01:35:14,720 --> 01:35:16,720
I hope none of my consoles get banned.

1491
01:35:16,720 --> 01:35:17,720
Interesting.

1492
01:35:17,720 --> 01:35:23,720
Of course, ironically enough, and this is kind of off topic, but since I have modded consoles,

1493
01:35:23,720 --> 01:35:25,720
I'll go ahead and talk about it.

1494
01:35:25,720 --> 01:35:30,720
It's not even really the fact that they're modded, it's the fact that they're older generation consoles.

1495
01:35:30,720 --> 01:35:37,720
I've had a 100% failure rate with Xbox 360s, the first generation of them.

1496
01:35:37,720 --> 01:35:45,720
And I have another one that's dead, or that's going to die, it's freezing up now.

1497
01:35:45,720 --> 01:35:48,720
And it was actually one that Microsoft repaired.

1498
01:35:48,720 --> 01:35:52,720
Of course, I went and modded it, so now they can't repair it again.

1499
01:35:52,720 --> 01:36:01,720
But the new arcade systems, when they have the HDMI ports and stuff on them, those live, sort of.

1500
01:36:01,720 --> 01:36:04,720
It's just the older ones do not.

1501
01:36:04,720 --> 01:36:12,720
My sister's console, which I actually have a new one coming for her, the video died on it, which sucks.

1502
01:36:12,720 --> 01:36:17,720
But the one console though that is dying right now, I'm going to probably take some of the fix.

1503
01:36:17,720 --> 01:36:20,720
And I'm going to take the other one too, just to see if they can fix that one.

1504
01:36:20,720 --> 01:36:23,720
Because that's a different error, but we'll see.

1505
01:36:23,720 --> 01:36:28,720
But god damn it, seriously, talk about crappy hardware.

1506
01:36:28,720 --> 01:36:31,720
Although I love them.

1507
01:36:31,720 --> 01:36:35,720
And their console's good, and I will buy another one.

1508
01:36:35,720 --> 01:36:37,720
Because I'm a sucker like that.

1509
01:36:37,720 --> 01:36:41,720
Because Grand Theft Auto IV is awesome, and I have to mod it.

1510
01:36:41,720 --> 01:36:44,720
Well now, I'd be curious to know if Loki's going to buy this.

1511
01:36:44,720 --> 01:36:49,720
It's something for the Wii that has nothing to do with President Cat, but it does have to do with an exercise bike.

1512
01:36:49,720 --> 01:36:54,720
Now, I seem to remember on the show a couple weeks ago, we were talking about some type of patent for an exercise bike.

1513
01:36:54,720 --> 01:36:58,720
Well, it wasn't a patent, it was a leaked, like, advertisement.

1514
01:36:58,720 --> 01:37:03,720
Well, it looks like this has come to fruition, because Cyberbike Cycling Sports is coming out.

1515
01:37:03,720 --> 01:37:06,720
But here's the thing, it's not from Nintendo.

1516
01:37:06,720 --> 01:37:12,720
It's coming from publisher Big Ben, and it comes with a, yes, full-size exercise bike controller.

1517
01:37:12,720 --> 01:37:17,720
And apparently it's very easy to set up, it has an adjustable saddle, it has handlebars and all this.

1518
01:37:17,720 --> 01:37:23,720
It's also compatible with Mario Kart Wii, go figure, but the game that comes with it is called Cyberbike.

1519
01:37:23,720 --> 01:37:26,720
It's supposed to come out in 2010.

1520
01:37:26,720 --> 01:37:28,720
It looks stupid.

1521
01:37:28,720 --> 01:37:34,720
Okay, the other one, which looked pretty ridiculous to begin with, you know, had a smaller peripheral.

1522
01:37:34,720 --> 01:37:38,720
I mean, I could understand maybe having that, because that's a little bit smaller.

1523
01:37:38,720 --> 01:37:43,720
You know, maybe there's some games that might use it later on, but this is a full fucking exercise bike.

1524
01:37:43,720 --> 01:37:50,720
You do not need an exercise bike to go with the damn game, just buy an exercise bike if you're gonna buy an exercise bike.

1525
01:37:52,720 --> 01:37:58,720
Alright, um, moving on, DarkSakura.

1526
01:37:58,720 --> 01:38:01,720
Oh yes, I'm sorry, I'm still, uh...

1527
01:38:01,720 --> 01:38:03,720
No, I know, I'm so distracted with the Rina We thing, too.

1528
01:38:03,720 --> 01:38:05,720
They just, they said something again, to you.

1529
01:38:05,720 --> 01:38:06,720
To me?

1530
01:38:06,720 --> 01:38:09,720
I see, I'm a little confused now, many follower in English.

1531
01:38:09,720 --> 01:38:11,720
Oh, oh, gur, my poor English.

1532
01:38:11,720 --> 01:38:18,720
I almost feel bad, because they've got to be overwhelmed right now, because Twitter only had like 80 followers, which is fucking criminal.

1533
01:38:18,720 --> 01:38:19,720
Yeah.

1534
01:38:19,720 --> 01:38:25,720
And they've already got like 20 new followers throughout the show tonight, and it's probably going to continue to grow as people listen to this podcast.

1535
01:38:25,720 --> 01:38:27,720
Please go follow them.

1536
01:38:27,720 --> 01:38:33,720
They are feeling like probably a little overwhelmed at this whole thing, but people need to know, cats are adorable, dammit.

1537
01:38:33,720 --> 01:38:34,720
I know.

1538
01:38:34,720 --> 01:38:36,720
So if we're distracted tonight, sorry, this is...

1539
01:38:36,720 --> 01:38:43,720
If Keyboard Cat can be as popular as it is, if Keyboard Cat can get referenced in Scribblenauts, there is no reason.

1540
01:38:43,720 --> 01:38:52,720
Okay, if they can put out all these stupid party games that don't sell maybe a thousand copies, you know, they just, they're crappy, crappy, crappy, cheap ass party games.

1541
01:38:52,720 --> 01:38:54,720
Why the hell can't they port this over?

1542
01:38:54,720 --> 01:39:04,720
They port all these, you know, UK games that are like, absolutely not popular at all, like these franchises I've never heard of before.

1543
01:39:04,720 --> 01:39:07,720
And I can't get a goddamn cat playing a fucking piano.

1544
01:39:07,720 --> 01:39:12,720
Exactly, why can't they put out a cute cat game?

1545
01:39:12,720 --> 01:39:19,720
Alright, sj100matt in chat, speaking of the last story, says, wait, Mr. Garrison's Wild Wacky Action Bike, the game?

1546
01:39:19,720 --> 01:39:25,720
No, it's not that kind of peripheral, but I bet with a little duct tape, you can achieve anything.

1547
01:39:25,720 --> 01:39:26,720
If you want.

1548
01:39:26,720 --> 01:39:33,720
Question is, Rob, how quick before someone tries to put their penis in it?

1549
01:39:33,720 --> 01:39:39,720
That is always the quintessential question here on Orange Launch Radio, how quick before someone tries to put their penis in it.

1550
01:39:39,720 --> 01:39:48,720
And the exercise bike, not long, I mean, I don't know really where you would put your penis, but I'm sure somewhere it'll happen.

1551
01:39:48,720 --> 01:39:55,720
Alright, anyhow, sorry, Darsakura, we keep interrupting, I know you're trying to correspond with Rina Wee, but there is a show still to be done.

1552
01:39:55,720 --> 01:39:59,720
I'm just saying, thank you for being patient with us, I wish I knew better Japanese.

1553
01:39:59,720 --> 01:40:18,720
Well, back to Nintendo, Miyamoto has actually brought back a little bit more conversation in regards to HD Wee, by saying that they want to support new technology as it comes out.

1554
01:40:18,720 --> 01:40:27,720
And he's actually even saying that if he was a consumer that had an HDTV, he'd want to play his games with nice graphics too.

1555
01:40:27,720 --> 01:40:38,720
So they're actually going to be moving with it as HD technology becomes more and more prevalent, which really it is, I mean, you know what I mean?

1556
01:40:38,720 --> 01:41:03,720
But they are pretty adamant that they're going to focus on gameplay, but not close the door on HD. In fact, there's actually some financial analysts already that are saying that it's definitely going to happen this summer.

1557
01:41:03,720 --> 01:41:11,720
And I think that it's... I don't really know how they're going to do it, other than add-ons, but...

1558
01:41:11,720 --> 01:41:19,720
Well, I think, you know, we've been saying on this show for some time, the Super Wee or the Wee HD that will be backwards compatible with the original...

1559
01:41:19,720 --> 01:41:20,720
The Wee Double D!

1560
01:41:20,720 --> 01:41:34,720
The Wee with four eyes or something, Will, is inevitable. It's going to happen. I think the question is, when? And certainly, you know, summer 2010, I don't need a mega expensive analyst to tell me that.

1561
01:41:34,720 --> 01:41:42,720
I mean, I think I said that on the show months ago, that it's probably going to happen. Of course, I also called it for this year, so I'm not always right, but this is why I do the show for free.

1562
01:41:42,720 --> 01:41:54,720
But the one question, we'll let have President Cat. No, but seriously, I mean, Wee HD, is now the time or is everybody just getting over-anxious because Wee HD is what they want?

1563
01:41:54,720 --> 01:41:59,720
Loki, I'm especially curious to hear from you. I know you're doing other stuff, but I'm kind of curious what you think.

1564
01:41:59,720 --> 01:42:05,720
I don't want another Wee HD. I'm finding my Wee right now.

1565
01:42:05,720 --> 01:42:08,720
Is that just because you don't want to spend more money or what's the deal?

1566
01:42:08,720 --> 01:42:19,720
No, I don't think money is an option. Really, it's just the problem is I'm so jaded by what they've done so far with the Wee. Why do I really want to go through the gamble again?

1567
01:42:19,720 --> 01:42:21,720
Because tonight we have seen its potential.

1568
01:42:21,720 --> 01:42:32,720
Listen, OK, I am checking my bank account. Why am I checking my bank account? Because I am buying President Cat. This purchase is imminent, OK? It's happening.

1569
01:42:32,720 --> 01:42:42,720
I'm buying it, too. I'm buying it, too. I don't even have a thing that can play it, but I'm going to buy it. Why? Because I don't know. Don't fucking judge me. I just want it.

1570
01:42:42,720 --> 01:42:47,720
I will look at the manual and purr at it or something. I don't know. Someday my Wee will play it.

1571
01:42:47,720 --> 01:42:52,720
You want to pay for the massage for me? You can get me President Cat.

1572
01:42:52,720 --> 01:42:56,720
Plus, I oddly want to support this.

1573
01:42:56,720 --> 01:42:57,720
I do, too.

1574
01:42:57,720 --> 01:42:59,720
I hope the game doesn't stink.

1575
01:42:59,720 --> 01:43:00,720
Oh, yeah.

1576
01:43:00,720 --> 01:43:07,720
I don't care if it stinks or not. The whole fun is going to be the whole novelty.

1577
01:43:07,720 --> 01:43:16,720
Keep in mind, it's taken me a long time to actually sit and read the blog, just the little comics of the cat, but it's freaking funny.

1578
01:43:16,720 --> 01:43:21,720
Cat's like, why am I on your t-shirt? Pat, pat, pat.

1579
01:43:21,720 --> 01:43:32,720
I don't know if you guys heard me laughing earlier. Keep in mind, I probably read on a five-year-old level in Japanese.

1580
01:43:32,720 --> 01:43:39,720
Which is probably the perfect age of what this game is geared towards, yet we're all sitting here going, eee, cats, eee.

1581
01:43:39,720 --> 01:43:41,720
You notice who's not in the room.

1582
01:43:41,720 --> 01:43:42,720
Who?

1583
01:43:42,720 --> 01:43:48,720
Shermie. Shermie's like, screw all you, I'm gone.

1584
01:43:48,720 --> 01:43:54,720
Anyhow, Wii HD, I think it's going to happen. It'll be backwards compatible with all the Wii games.

1585
01:43:54,720 --> 01:43:58,720
It's just a matter of when. We know it. It's a must.

1586
01:43:58,720 --> 01:44:01,720
Oh, they replied and said, I wish I knew better English, too.

1587
01:44:01,720 --> 01:44:05,720
Aww. I just want to hug them.

1588
01:44:05,720 --> 01:44:09,720
You know, I am supposed to go to Japan next year. I should offer to come give her a hug, or him.

1589
01:44:09,720 --> 01:44:12,720
I don't care. I'll hug them, whoever they are.

1590
01:44:12,720 --> 01:44:14,720
Anyhow, Loki.

1591
01:44:14,720 --> 01:44:16,720
Oh, I'm sorry.

1592
01:44:16,720 --> 01:44:22,720
So, speaking of Xbox 360 updates and possible bannings of people and stuff like that.

1593
01:44:22,720 --> 01:44:27,720
There is another update that's going to ban stuff, and that will be, of course, the fall update.

1594
01:44:27,720 --> 01:44:31,720
It will be banning unauthorized memory units.

1595
01:44:31,720 --> 01:44:37,720
Yes, you may remember we talked a little bit about max memory units being put out by, I believe, Datel.

1596
01:44:37,720 --> 01:44:48,720
These will allow you to use a micro SD card and support it up to 2GB to 4GB of memory.

1597
01:44:48,720 --> 01:44:52,720
Which is awesome, because the Microsoft memory units are really fucking expensive.

1598
01:44:52,720 --> 01:44:59,720
For like $50 or $40, you get a 512MB memory unit, which is ridiculous.

1599
01:44:59,720 --> 01:45:06,720
Especially since, hell, you can get a USB drive for nothing.

1600
01:45:06,720 --> 01:45:12,720
So, being the greedy bastards that they are, they decided, hey, you know what?

1601
01:45:12,720 --> 01:45:16,720
We don't want you to sell this, and so we're going to block it.

1602
01:45:16,720 --> 01:45:19,720
So if you bought it, you're shit out of luck.

1603
01:45:19,720 --> 01:45:22,720
And there's nothing you can do about it.

1604
01:45:22,720 --> 01:45:25,720
But people are pissed, but Microsoft says, who gives a shit?

1605
01:45:25,720 --> 01:45:29,720
It's our console, we'll do what we want, nah nah nah nah nah.

1606
01:45:29,720 --> 01:45:32,720
I'm kind of on the fence with this. I think they...

1607
01:45:32,720 --> 01:45:34,720
They have the right to do it, but it's a dick move.

1608
01:45:34,720 --> 01:45:38,720
Yeah, it's a cock block move, is what they're doing.

1609
01:45:38,720 --> 01:45:43,720
And it kind of sucks, because the person who loses here is the consumer.

1610
01:45:43,720 --> 01:45:45,720
Not the developer of this memory unit.

1611
01:45:45,720 --> 01:45:48,720
They already made the money from selling it to the consumer.

1612
01:45:48,720 --> 01:45:50,720
It's the consumer who's shit out of luck.

1613
01:45:50,720 --> 01:45:56,720
But, if I'm understanding this right, this isn't aimed so much as things that might be in stores.

1614
01:45:56,720 --> 01:45:59,720
Because there aren't a lot of these unauthorised things in stores.

1615
01:45:59,720 --> 01:46:03,720
This is aimed at people trying to jerry-rig hard drives to do everything, right?

1616
01:46:03,720 --> 01:46:10,720
This is aimed at... Well, these devices are aimed at just the consumer, but it's a cheaper alternative with more memory.

1617
01:46:10,720 --> 01:46:12,720
But it's not being offered by Microsoft.

1618
01:46:12,720 --> 01:46:16,720
And so, therefore, it goes away.

1619
01:46:16,720 --> 01:46:19,720
It's the same reason why there's no third-party hard drives.

1620
01:46:19,720 --> 01:46:22,720
Because, I can tell you this much, hard drives are damn cheap.

1621
01:46:22,720 --> 01:46:28,720
And especially these drives they're offering for $150, you can get a terabyte drive for $150.

1622
01:46:28,720 --> 01:46:34,720
So, I guess that's true. Yeah, I think Microsoft does kind of rip off a little bit with their storage.

1623
01:46:34,720 --> 01:46:37,720
But this is, you know...

1624
01:46:37,720 --> 01:46:43,720
You know what's really disturbing is the whole wireless adapter.

1625
01:46:43,720 --> 01:46:45,720
You want to talk about how they really rip people off.

1626
01:46:45,720 --> 01:46:49,720
I hope they don't block out my wireless adapter just because it's not an official Microsoft one.

1627
01:46:49,720 --> 01:46:51,720
No, that they can't because it's USB powered.

1628
01:46:51,720 --> 01:46:54,720
And the wireless adapters, I mean, it's just by Ethernet.

1629
01:46:54,720 --> 01:46:59,720
They can't block that because it's not USB or... Well, the memory units are technically kind of USB,

1630
01:46:59,720 --> 01:47:02,720
but it's like some weird setup.

1631
01:47:02,720 --> 01:47:05,720
So, they can block it by the device ID.

1632
01:47:05,720 --> 01:47:07,720
Same with controllers if they want to.

1633
01:47:07,720 --> 01:47:11,720
I think they could block controllers that way too, but they don't.

1634
01:47:11,720 --> 01:47:16,720
Alright, but the thing is though, when the new 250GB hard drives come out,

1635
01:47:16,720 --> 01:47:24,720
there are ways out there to make your own hard drive for the 360 by modifying a laptop hard drive.

1636
01:47:24,720 --> 01:47:27,720
So, if you want to go through the trouble, you can do that for cheaper.

1637
01:47:27,720 --> 01:47:30,720
And now you can do it up to 250GB.

1638
01:47:30,720 --> 01:47:32,720
Amazing.

1639
01:47:32,720 --> 01:47:35,720
Moving on to another story about the Wii.

1640
01:47:35,720 --> 01:47:39,720
I want to talk about New Super Mario Brothers Wii and the whole demo play.

1641
01:47:39,720 --> 01:47:41,720
Remember this was very controversial.

1642
01:47:41,720 --> 01:47:43,720
We've talked about it in an extent on the show.

1643
01:47:43,720 --> 01:47:48,720
This is the whole, when you pause the game, you can have it play for you to get through certain parts of the game.

1644
01:47:48,720 --> 01:47:52,720
Well, now details have emerged on how it actually works.

1645
01:47:52,720 --> 01:47:54,720
So, see what you guys think of this, okay?

1646
01:47:54,720 --> 01:47:58,720
The mode is actually called Super Guide, okay?

1647
01:47:58,720 --> 01:48:02,720
And it doesn't really work exactly the way people think it would.

1648
01:48:02,720 --> 01:48:07,720
What happens is that if you die 8 times on one of the stages, there's 80 stages in the game,

1649
01:48:07,720 --> 01:48:13,720
if you die 8 times, then what happens is that you'll have a chance to hit a green Super Guide block.

1650
01:48:13,720 --> 01:48:17,720
What will happen is that then a video is going to show up, Luigi plays through the stage.

1651
01:48:17,720 --> 01:48:21,720
It's not going to show you hidden paths, it's not going to show you hidden coins,

1652
01:48:21,720 --> 01:48:23,720
it just kind of shows you how to get through the stage.

1653
01:48:23,720 --> 01:48:25,720
It will show you how the stage could be completed.

1654
01:48:25,720 --> 01:48:29,720
At any time, the player can jump in and take over,

1655
01:48:29,720 --> 01:48:34,720
and then the game basically will have played you through the parts you can't get through.

1656
01:48:34,720 --> 01:48:40,720
If you want, though, you can just let the game complete the level for you and move on to the next stage.

1657
01:48:40,720 --> 01:48:44,720
Now, Miyamoto has said there are some disadvantages to using Super Guide.

1658
01:48:44,720 --> 01:48:47,720
If you decide not to use the Super Guide at all during the game,

1659
01:48:47,720 --> 01:48:50,720
you stay away from the blocks and don't use them, you get something special.

1660
01:48:50,720 --> 01:48:52,720
Of course, that could be anything.

1661
01:48:52,720 --> 01:48:54,720
Could that be something new on the title screen?

1662
01:48:54,720 --> 01:48:56,720
Could it be an unlockable character?

1663
01:48:56,720 --> 01:48:57,720
Who knows what that could be.

1664
01:48:57,720 --> 01:48:59,720
But if you rely on them, you're going to miss out.

1665
01:48:59,720 --> 01:49:05,720
And, of course, just the whole morale of the fact you had to use the Super Guide to beat the level.

1666
01:49:05,720 --> 01:49:11,720
A quote from Miyamoto in a little article that is running on Destructoid right now,

1667
01:49:11,720 --> 01:49:14,720
I find that when the Super Guide block does appear,

1668
01:49:14,720 --> 01:49:17,720
I kind of feel regretful and guilty that I've let that happen.

1669
01:49:17,720 --> 01:49:19,720
So I've often found that playing the game, when that happens,

1670
01:49:19,720 --> 01:49:21,720
it kind of inspires me to say,

1671
01:49:21,720 --> 01:49:24,720
I've already done this bad, now I have to clear the level on my own.

1672
01:49:24,720 --> 01:49:29,720
So, you know, I guess they're saying that you just feel a general sense of,

1673
01:49:29,720 --> 01:49:32,720
well, you cheated to beat the level in order to actually get through it.

1674
01:49:32,720 --> 01:49:35,720
So, I don't know, what do you guys think?

1675
01:49:35,720 --> 01:49:37,720
Now that you hear the details on how this actually works,

1676
01:49:37,720 --> 01:49:41,720
that it's a brick that appears if you die eight times, what do you think?

1677
01:49:41,720 --> 01:49:44,720
Is it still a joke? Is it useful?

1678
01:49:44,720 --> 01:49:49,720
It's got a use for it, but, you know, at the same time, it's kind of, I don't know.

1679
01:49:49,720 --> 01:49:53,720
I've stopped caring, basically, I think is what it is.

1680
01:49:53,720 --> 01:49:56,720
It's like, it was fun to complain about and stuff like that a while ago,

1681
01:49:56,720 --> 01:50:02,720
but they've just hired me out, so I just don't care anymore.

1682
01:50:02,720 --> 01:50:06,720
And on top of that, I'll have you know that I've already placed my order for President Cat,

1683
01:50:06,720 --> 01:50:07,720
which will be here shortly after-

1684
01:50:07,720 --> 01:50:08,720
High five! High five!

1685
01:50:08,720 --> 01:50:10,720
Shortly after street date, yes.

1686
01:50:10,720 --> 01:50:14,720
To play on my modded Wii that will take games from any region.

1687
01:50:14,720 --> 01:50:16,720
That means we need the camera next week.

1688
01:50:16,720 --> 01:50:21,720
I just sent them a message saying, you know, that I'm one of the hosts

1689
01:50:21,720 --> 01:50:25,720
and that I have a friend that speaks Japanese who I can probably get to translate for us.

1690
01:50:25,720 --> 01:50:29,720
So, we've got several friends in Japan. We've got several listeners in Japan.

1691
01:50:29,720 --> 01:50:33,720
See if she could write a story for our website.

1692
01:50:33,720 --> 01:50:36,720
Like, just an interview. Interview them for a story on the website or something.

1693
01:50:36,720 --> 01:50:37,720
I'll talk to her.

1694
01:50:37,720 --> 01:50:41,720
Yeah, please do. I don't know if that would interest her at all, but that would be amazing.

1695
01:50:41,720 --> 01:50:42,720
All right.

1696
01:50:42,720 --> 01:50:43,720
President Cat!

1697
01:50:43,720 --> 01:50:47,720
Let's get some comments from our chat room.

1698
01:50:47,720 --> 01:50:52,720
Let's see. Gameguru says, problem with Wii HD coming out before the next Xbox or Playstation

1699
01:50:52,720 --> 01:50:56,720
is that it won't be graphically on par with them and won't initially have the Wii's fan base.

1700
01:50:56,720 --> 01:51:00,720
That's going back to a previous news story, but that's okay because I know there's a little delay.

1701
01:51:00,720 --> 01:51:04,720
XLink calls this Super Cheater 5000 is the name of the device.

1702
01:51:04,720 --> 01:51:07,720
You know, again, I think we have to remember the audience this is aimed at.

1703
01:51:07,720 --> 01:51:14,720
And I think for the casual player, this is, you know, going to be a good thing.

1704
01:51:14,720 --> 01:51:15,720
But I think for the rest of us,

1705
01:51:15,720 --> 01:51:20,720
I do really like the fact that you at least get some unlockable if you don't do it.

1706
01:51:20,720 --> 01:51:24,720
I just hope that unlockable carries some weight a little bit.

1707
01:51:24,720 --> 01:51:27,720
You know, unfortunately, Wii doesn't have anything like achievements,

1708
01:51:27,720 --> 01:51:32,720
so hopefully it'll have some type of E-peen that you can show other people

1709
01:51:32,720 --> 01:51:35,720
because who doesn't like to stroke their E-peen?

1710
01:51:35,720 --> 01:51:37,720
DarkSakura, don't you love to stroke your E-peen?

1711
01:51:37,720 --> 01:51:38,720
Yeah.

1712
01:51:38,720 --> 01:51:41,720
All right. One way DarkSakura likes to stroke her E-peen is every week she'll open up the mailbag

1713
01:51:41,720 --> 01:51:45,720
and read some emails from our listeners at mailbagatorangelaungeradio.com.

1714
01:51:45,720 --> 01:51:49,720
So DarkSakura, please open up the mailbag.

1715
01:51:49,720 --> 01:51:51,720
There wasn't very much when I looked in there earlier, but maybe there is now.

1716
01:51:51,720 --> 01:51:52,720
There's one.

1717
01:51:52,720 --> 01:51:53,720
One email.

1718
01:51:53,720 --> 01:51:54,720
From J-Rod.

1719
01:51:54,720 --> 01:51:57,720
All right. Well, let's read it tonight in tonight's mailbag segment.

1720
01:51:57,720 --> 01:52:01,720
And we'll just have to roll anything that comes in now to next week.

1721
01:52:01,720 --> 01:52:02,720
President Cat.

1722
01:52:02,720 --> 01:52:05,720
I anticipate we're going to have a lot of President Cat emails this week, but we'll see.

1723
01:52:05,720 --> 01:52:07,720
Hello, OLR crew.

1724
01:52:07,720 --> 01:52:13,720
I currently listen to the latest podcast on the feed where Rob and Loki completely trash the PSP Go.

1725
01:52:13,720 --> 01:52:20,720
What everyone who bad mouths the PSP Go needs to realize is that maybe the PSP Go is supposed to be a new PSP owner purchase and not an upgrade.

1726
01:52:20,720 --> 01:52:27,720
I never had a PSP before, but seeing all the stuff on PSN and the new PSP Go pushed me over the edge to get one finally.

1727
01:52:27,720 --> 01:52:31,720
It is a sleek portable, and the sliding screen looks cool as hell.

1728
01:52:31,720 --> 01:52:40,720
Now, if I owned an older PSP, of course I wouldn't buy the PSP Go the same way I wouldn't buy a DSi if I owned a Lite or a Phat.

1729
01:52:40,720 --> 01:52:46,720
I honestly don't think the PSP Go is even aimed at the current PSP owners, but new customers like myself.

1730
01:52:46,720 --> 01:52:50,720
So really, no need to take a shit on it. Just don't buy it and enjoy your current PSPs.

1731
01:52:50,720 --> 01:52:54,720
This email sponsored by the Olive Garden, home of the River Reading Salad and Breadsticks.

1732
01:52:54,720 --> 01:52:56,720
Um, I will say this.

1733
01:52:56,720 --> 01:52:57,720
And this is me.

1734
01:52:57,720 --> 01:52:59,720
Okay, this is just me.

1735
01:52:59,720 --> 01:53:13,720
If I was a new customer, and I was told to pick one to buy, if they were all the same price, I would pick the 3,000.

1736
01:53:13,720 --> 01:53:15,720
I wouldn't get a Go.

1737
01:53:15,720 --> 01:53:19,720
And we've said on this show that the PSP 3,000 is a great system. It's pretty cool.

1738
01:53:19,720 --> 01:53:23,720
And the thing is, I don't understand why you would pay more money for a system that does less, basically.

1739
01:53:23,720 --> 01:53:25,720
That's my question.

1740
01:53:25,720 --> 01:53:30,720
I'm not even talking about people that own a PlayStation Portable already, because there's no reason they need another system.

1741
01:53:30,720 --> 01:53:32,720
I don't understand that at all, why would you buy another one.

1742
01:53:32,720 --> 01:53:40,720
Why I said that, because I actually have two PSPs, but the 2,000 actually had a little bit more RAM and stuff like that, and it was a little bit different.

1743
01:53:40,720 --> 01:53:44,720
The 3,000 has a built-in microphone and whatnot, so that's alright.

1744
01:53:44,720 --> 01:53:49,720
But, the fact is, the 3,000 is cheaper.

1745
01:53:49,720 --> 01:53:51,720
It plays the same downloadable games.

1746
01:53:51,720 --> 01:53:55,720
Plus, you have the option now to purchase games that are on UMD.

1747
01:53:55,720 --> 01:53:59,720
Plus, you can get memory units and stuff like that for it.

1748
01:53:59,720 --> 01:54:01,720
Yes, it doesn't have built-in memory, but you know what?

1749
01:54:01,720 --> 01:54:07,720
Memory is cheap, so it's not really worth paying the extra money for memory that's in the system.

1750
01:54:07,720 --> 01:54:13,720
And that sliding screen may look cool and stuff, but at the same time, I'm wondering how soon that's going to break.

1751
01:54:13,720 --> 01:54:23,720
I do give them credit for the fact that they have the ability to sync up your DualShock 3 controller with it to play games when you have it hooked up to your TV.

1752
01:54:23,720 --> 01:54:29,720
I can't say that I've actually used that function on my PSP 2,000.

1753
01:54:29,720 --> 01:54:35,720
I mean, I've played games on TV before, but maybe once or twice to see it and check it out.

1754
01:54:35,720 --> 01:54:40,720
I don't understand why you would pay more money for a system that does less.

1755
01:54:40,720 --> 01:54:42,720
That's basically my argument.

1756
01:54:42,720 --> 01:54:50,720
But hey, if you want to, and if you think it's a cool-looking system or whatever, more power to you.

1757
01:54:50,720 --> 01:54:52,720
I got to try one.

1758
01:54:52,720 --> 01:54:57,720
A guy in my art history class had one.

1759
01:54:57,720 --> 01:55:02,720
Well, I didn't really sit and play on anything, but he let me hold it and push the buttons.

1760
01:55:02,720 --> 01:55:05,720
And I have to say that it really felt flimsy.

1761
01:55:05,720 --> 01:55:08,720
It felt really cheap.

1762
01:55:08,720 --> 01:55:13,720
My iPhone weighs more, and of course I have an old iPhone, but it weighs more than the PSP Go.

1763
01:55:13,720 --> 01:55:16,720
And the plastic just felt like poor quality.

1764
01:55:16,720 --> 01:55:22,720
I just really felt like if I had a moment of frustration and gripped it too tightly that I would break it.

1765
01:55:22,720 --> 01:55:26,720
I really had the feeling that it was fragile.

1766
01:55:26,720 --> 01:55:31,720
I want to take a quick poll in here because I want to kind of address the Sony people for a minute.

1767
01:55:31,720 --> 01:55:35,720
Because especially in reading some of the reviews on Twitter and so forth.

1768
01:55:35,720 --> 01:55:39,720
I'm sorry, not Twitter. Twitter's on my mind tonight because of everything else going on.

1769
01:55:39,720 --> 01:55:41,720
But on iTunes and everything.

1770
01:55:41,720 --> 01:55:45,720
People have been unnecessarily harsh to our program because they think we're slanted against Sony.

1771
01:55:45,720 --> 01:55:48,720
And I want to make it very clear, it's not the case.

1772
01:55:48,720 --> 01:55:50,720
We haze people when they deserve to be hazed.

1773
01:55:50,720 --> 01:55:52,720
And I want to prove that here with something.

1774
01:55:52,720 --> 01:55:57,720
And I'm not saying this particular emailer is a part of that because I know he's emailed us a bunch about various topics.

1775
01:55:57,720 --> 01:56:00,720
But I'm just saying, hold on a minute, because it works both ways here.

1776
01:56:00,720 --> 01:56:02,720
Quick poll of the room.

1777
01:56:02,720 --> 01:56:06,720
How many of you own a DSi?

1778
01:56:06,720 --> 01:56:09,720
No. I don't. I don't. Exactly.

1779
01:56:09,720 --> 01:56:11,720
None of us own a DSi either.

1780
01:56:11,720 --> 01:56:13,720
And for many of the same reasons.

1781
01:56:13,720 --> 01:56:16,720
Because what's the difference between a DS and a DSi?

1782
01:56:16,720 --> 01:56:18,720
It has a camera. It has a camera.

1783
01:56:18,720 --> 01:56:21,720
I'll get a DSi when there are more specific DSi games.

1784
01:56:21,720 --> 01:56:25,720
But other than that, there's no legitimate reason for me to have a DSi.

1785
01:56:25,720 --> 01:56:29,720
It's got a camera with it and the price points are pretty similar.

1786
01:56:29,720 --> 01:56:33,720
But at the same time, it doesn't warrant me purchasing another system that plays the same games, basically.

1787
01:56:33,720 --> 01:56:37,720
They put out a camera on the old Game Boy Color.

1788
01:56:37,720 --> 01:56:39,720
Guess who didn't buy one? Me.

1789
01:56:39,720 --> 01:56:41,720
Eddie is saying two cameras.

1790
01:56:41,720 --> 01:56:43,720
But here's something else to consider.

1791
01:56:43,720 --> 01:56:46,720
If I remember right, the DSi got rid of the Game Boy Advance slot, too.

1792
01:56:46,720 --> 01:56:47,720
Exactly.

1793
01:56:47,720 --> 01:56:48,720
So you can't play games.

1794
01:56:48,720 --> 01:56:49,720
Less functionality.

1795
01:56:49,720 --> 01:56:54,720
So it's, in a way, almost just as bad as the PSP Go and the PSP 3000.

1796
01:56:54,720 --> 01:56:57,720
Here's my question that is not really being answered.

1797
01:56:57,720 --> 01:57:04,720
What do you get with the PSP Go that you don't get on the PSP 3000 that justifies the increased price?

1798
01:57:04,720 --> 01:57:14,720
At least in the DS world, you can say a camera, the downloadable game service, and the SD card support.

1799
01:57:14,720 --> 01:57:16,720
Okay, fair enough. So you've named a couple things that you would with a DS.

1800
01:57:16,720 --> 01:57:18,720
And I even knocked on that.

1801
01:57:18,720 --> 01:57:20,720
It's not enough for me.

1802
01:57:20,720 --> 01:57:21,720
For me.

1803
01:57:21,720 --> 01:57:25,720
But for a new player, okay, now you have to weigh the pros and the cons.

1804
01:57:25,720 --> 01:57:27,720
I don't get to play Game Boy Advance games anymore.

1805
01:57:27,720 --> 01:57:30,720
Pros. I get a camera, SD card slot, and downloadable games.

1806
01:57:30,720 --> 01:57:31,720
What do I want to do?

1807
01:57:31,720 --> 01:57:35,720
But with the PSP 3000 and the PSP Go, you have to weigh.

1808
01:57:35,720 --> 01:57:39,720
Con. It's more expensive and I lose the UMD.

1809
01:57:39,720 --> 01:57:41,720
Pro.

1810
01:57:41,720 --> 01:57:42,720
Chirp chirp.

1811
01:57:42,720 --> 01:57:43,720
It's cuter.

1812
01:57:43,720 --> 01:57:47,720
It's sleeker looking and it's got Bluetooth support.

1813
01:57:47,720 --> 01:57:48,720
So?

1814
01:57:48,720 --> 01:57:49,720
That's it.

1815
01:57:49,720 --> 01:57:59,720
And with the DSi even, if you are purchasing a new system, you're probably not going to be able to buy any Game Boy Advance games anyways out there because they're not selling them anymore.

1816
01:57:59,720 --> 01:58:01,720
They haven't been selling them for a few years now.

1817
01:58:01,720 --> 01:58:10,720
So it's not going to be that big a deal if you can't have a Game Boy Advance slot on there to people that are just getting into the DS or whatever.

1818
01:58:10,720 --> 01:58:12,720
And the DSi would be a good purchase for them.

1819
01:58:12,720 --> 01:58:20,720
But if you have Game Boy Advance games and you have a DS, why would you go and buy another game system?

1820
01:58:20,720 --> 01:58:27,720
I'm glad to know it's not just us tonight because there's a little bit of DSi rabble rabble going on in chat as well, but there is some comments.

1821
01:58:27,720 --> 01:58:33,720
SSJ100Matt says, aside from them putting President Cat on DSi, I never see myself getting a DSi.

1822
01:58:33,720 --> 01:58:37,720
And ActDef says, Matt indeed, President Cat on the DSi and I'll buy it instantly.

1823
01:58:37,720 --> 01:58:40,720
Which, by the way, I want to say, how fucking adorable is this?

1824
01:58:40,720 --> 01:58:47,720
ActDef tweeted the Reno-y people to say, hey, I'm in Mexico. It's not just USA people. I'm in Mexico and I think you're great.

1825
01:58:47,720 --> 01:58:54,720
And they responded, gracias. How adorable. I want to hug them all. I do.

1826
01:58:54,720 --> 01:58:56,720
I want President Cat.

1827
01:58:56,720 --> 01:58:58,720
Aren't you going to be traveling to Japan?

1828
01:58:58,720 --> 01:59:03,720
I'm supposed to travel to Japan in June, yes. In fact, I will be gone from the show for two or three weeks.

1829
01:59:03,720 --> 01:59:05,720
Take me with you.

1830
01:59:05,720 --> 01:59:08,720
You got money? I'm going on a tour type thing, so we'll see.

1831
01:59:08,720 --> 01:59:09,720
Okay.

1832
01:59:09,720 --> 01:59:15,720
But, yeah, I'm excited about that. More details on that next year.

1833
01:59:15,720 --> 01:59:17,720
I may have to miss E3 because of it. We'll see.

1834
01:59:17,720 --> 01:59:20,720
Rob, I have to teach you how to shop.

1835
01:59:20,720 --> 01:59:25,720
I know. I'm not going to know anything. That's why I won't go to a foreign country if it's not in a tour.

1836
01:59:25,720 --> 01:59:27,720
I'm going to teach you how to shop.

1837
01:59:27,720 --> 01:59:28,720
All right.

1838
01:59:28,720 --> 01:59:30,720
And ask for directions.

1839
01:59:30,720 --> 01:59:31,720
Teach me five-year-old Japanese.

1840
01:59:31,720 --> 01:59:33,720
I will teach you five-year-old Japanese.

1841
01:59:33,720 --> 01:59:35,720
Hey, I know five-year-old Japanese.

1842
01:59:35,720 --> 01:59:40,720
All right. So, anyway, if you want more e-mails, mailbag at orangelaungeradio.com.

1843
01:59:40,720 --> 01:59:45,720
Loki, we... Oh, I'm sorry. Before we get into that, I'm just all off tonight.

1844
01:59:45,720 --> 01:59:47,720
It's all right. It's President Cat.

1845
01:59:47,720 --> 01:59:51,720
It's not even just President Cat. You know what started it all?

1846
01:59:51,720 --> 01:59:54,720
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do.

1847
01:59:54,720 --> 01:59:56,720
Oh, yeah.

1848
01:59:56,720 --> 02:00:05,720
You thought I forgot about that, didn't you?

1849
02:00:05,720 --> 02:00:09,720
It's official. Dark Sakura is in the corner crying.

1850
02:00:09,720 --> 02:00:16,720
I was not. I got you. And I flipped Rob off a lot.

1851
02:00:16,720 --> 02:00:19,720
This is just one of those shows. You know, I was driving here tonight thinking,

1852
02:00:19,720 --> 02:00:21,720
God, I'm tired. This is just going to be a crappy show tonight.

1853
02:00:21,720 --> 02:00:22,720
My headache spun away.

1854
02:00:22,720 --> 02:00:23,720
Yeah, no, this is great.

1855
02:00:23,720 --> 02:00:24,720
Seriously.

1856
02:00:24,720 --> 02:00:29,720
But I swear to God, if you make me sick, not even President Cat can help you where you're going to go.

1857
02:00:29,720 --> 02:00:31,720
President Cat.

1858
02:00:33,720 --> 02:00:34,720
Anyhow.

1859
02:00:34,720 --> 02:00:37,720
Rob, you know what I have? I have a case of meh.

1860
02:00:37,720 --> 02:00:42,720
Leo Shannon Chat says, Rob, I made that my new iPhone ringtone. Awesome.

1861
02:00:42,720 --> 02:00:45,720
DJ Dark Knight says, Flying shoe coming up, lol.

1862
02:00:45,720 --> 02:00:48,720
And X-Link says, I was also in the corner crying.

1863
02:00:48,720 --> 02:00:52,720
Those comments from our lovely chat room, chat.orangelaungeradio.com.

1864
02:00:52,720 --> 02:00:56,720
All right, well, maybe for those of you that are sick and tired of Daytona, this segment is just for you.

1865
02:00:56,720 --> 02:00:58,720
It's the FUs of the Week.

1866
02:01:13,720 --> 02:01:19,720
All right, so starting off tonight, the story that inspired our FUs of the Week.

1867
02:01:19,720 --> 02:01:23,720
Apparently, a 15-year-old was set on fire this week.

1868
02:01:23,720 --> 02:01:24,720
And that's not cool.

1869
02:01:24,720 --> 02:01:31,720
You know, as much as we joke about fire, fire is to look at on the Indiana Jones ride and yell cool at or fuego.

1870
02:01:31,720 --> 02:01:33,720
You don't actually set people on fire.

1871
02:01:33,720 --> 02:01:35,720
That is not cool.

1872
02:01:35,720 --> 02:01:39,720
And unfortunately, this poor kid, Michael Brewer, was set on fire.

1873
02:01:39,720 --> 02:01:48,720
And the reason why, because Brewer owed one of the suspects who's been arrested US $40 for a video game.

1874
02:01:48,720 --> 02:01:53,720
This video game debt apparently made the suspect steal the father's bicycle.

1875
02:01:53,720 --> 02:01:55,720
Brewer reported the bicycle was stolen.

1876
02:01:55,720 --> 02:02:00,720
The suspect got arrested, but the suspect was released from a detention center on Monday morning.

1877
02:02:00,720 --> 02:02:03,720
And then Brewer was waiting for friends in an apartment complex.

1878
02:02:03,720 --> 02:02:08,720
The suspect, I guess, came up saying he's a snitch, a snitch, and poured on him.

1879
02:02:08,720 --> 02:02:11,720
And they poured alcohol and lighter and, yeah, gross.

1880
02:02:11,720 --> 02:02:14,720
So, I mean, just, what a monster.

1881
02:02:14,720 --> 02:02:15,720
What an ass.

1882
02:02:15,720 --> 02:02:17,720
And over a video game debt.

1883
02:02:17,720 --> 02:02:23,720
And it commented, prompted one sheriff to say in 31 years it's the most heinous crime I've ever seen.

1884
02:02:23,720 --> 02:02:26,720
All over $40 over a video game.

1885
02:02:26,720 --> 02:02:30,720
FU suspect whose name they clearly haven't released because he's a minor.

1886
02:02:30,720 --> 02:02:33,720
But they should so we can dedicate this segment to him.

1887
02:02:33,720 --> 02:02:35,720
Dark Soccer, do you have any FUs of the week?

1888
02:02:35,720 --> 02:02:41,720
I'm actually just trying to verify that I was reading this properly because they asked us what President Katz is.

1889
02:02:41,720 --> 02:02:43,720
So I was going to say doesn't that mean president?

1890
02:02:43,720 --> 02:02:45,720
Anyway, I'm about to say.

1891
02:02:45,720 --> 02:02:52,720
But, yeah, FU to my coworker who I refer to all the time as Mr. Annoying.

1892
02:02:52,720 --> 02:02:57,720
For, I took a five year old baby in tattletaling on something that didn't involve him.

1893
02:02:57,720 --> 02:03:00,720
Logie, do you have any FUs of the week?

1894
02:03:00,720 --> 02:03:03,720
My FU of the week goes to pushy salesmen.

1895
02:03:03,720 --> 02:03:06,720
Especially people that come door to door selling stuff.

1896
02:03:06,720 --> 02:03:10,720
Because I'm always a sucker at opening the door and I really shouldn't.

1897
02:03:10,720 --> 02:03:15,720
So we had a guy that we were looking for roof quotes because we need a new roof on our house.

1898
02:03:15,720 --> 02:03:21,720
And this guy came and gave us this sales pitch that took two hours.

1899
02:03:21,720 --> 02:03:28,720
And, well, he was really pushy and annoying so it sucked.

1900
02:03:28,720 --> 02:03:32,720
And if I hadn't answered the door I wouldn't have to deal with it.

1901
02:03:32,720 --> 02:03:37,720
So FU that because I hate these people.

1902
02:03:37,720 --> 02:03:45,720
My FU of the week just goes to, gosh, tonight I've laughed so hard I'm actually not that angsty.

1903
02:03:45,720 --> 02:03:49,720
I guess my FU goes to drama.

1904
02:03:49,720 --> 02:03:50,720
Drama.

1905
02:03:50,720 --> 02:03:51,720
In general.

1906
02:03:51,720 --> 02:03:56,720
Although, honestly, you know, things are okay. I can't complain too much.

1907
02:03:56,720 --> 02:03:58,720
Everything's better with President Cat.

1908
02:03:58,720 --> 02:04:02,720
It really is. Although now we're finding out when the official people are saying what's President Cat.

1909
02:04:02,720 --> 02:04:04,720
Clearly that is not the name of the game.

1910
02:04:04,720 --> 02:04:07,720
So I just tweeted him, do you have a better translation?

1911
02:04:07,720 --> 02:04:14,720
I see that. Well, that's what I copied the actual kanji over because, was it sensual?

1912
02:04:14,720 --> 02:04:22,720
It's like, for example, there's a different word that's similar that means like class president when you're in school.

1913
02:04:22,720 --> 02:04:26,720
And so and so president. It's a different type of position.

1914
02:04:26,720 --> 02:04:30,720
And president would be the closest equivalent.

1915
02:04:30,720 --> 02:04:32,720
I still think that's a cool name for a game, President Cat.

1916
02:04:32,720 --> 02:04:37,720
I mean, even if that's not the translation, wouldn't that be awesome if we just named the game?

1917
02:04:37,720 --> 02:04:39,720
I think it would be like company president.

1918
02:04:39,720 --> 02:04:41,720
And you could do it. Okay. Get this. Follow me with this.

1919
02:04:41,720 --> 02:04:47,720
You could do it in the style, have the cat like kind of looking up in the sky, doing the style of Obama.

1920
02:04:47,720 --> 02:04:52,720
And that would be so the Obama poster. That would be awesome.

1921
02:04:52,720 --> 02:04:54,720
That could be the cover of the game.

1922
02:04:54,720 --> 02:04:57,720
We're going to make that the website. I'm telling you.

1923
02:04:57,720 --> 02:05:03,720
We're going to do it. I can't stress this enough. Please upload your your President Cat or whatever the hell this game is called.

1924
02:05:03,720 --> 02:05:06,720
Your fan art, your whatever.

1925
02:05:06,720 --> 02:05:12,720
Put it on the OLR picks thing and then tweet it to this poor girl who doesn't know what the hell she just woke up to today.

1926
02:05:12,720 --> 02:05:14,720
Here. And show them the love.

1927
02:05:14,720 --> 02:05:16,720
The cat, Renna is the cat's name.

1928
02:05:16,720 --> 02:05:19,720
Okay. Okay. I got the Renna part. Okay.

1929
02:05:19,720 --> 02:05:25,720
And Sancho, Shacho would be, I guess, like company president.

1930
02:05:25,720 --> 02:05:27,720
Just call it Obama cat and be done with it.

1931
02:05:27,720 --> 02:05:29,720
The game will sell millions of copies.

1932
02:05:29,720 --> 02:05:34,720
Now, it'll be on Fox News about how it brainwashes kids and will laugh.

1933
02:05:34,720 --> 02:05:39,720
The one Sukeban I think has to do with.

1934
02:05:39,720 --> 02:05:45,720
I think it means something about female something.

1935
02:05:45,720 --> 02:05:52,720
I don't know. I think Dark Tetsuya says top cat.

1936
02:05:52,720 --> 02:05:55,720
Oh, God, like top chef, top cat. I'd love that.

1937
02:05:55,720 --> 02:05:59,720
All right. Anyhow, let's move on with a couple more stories.

1938
02:05:59,720 --> 02:06:01,720
Sukeban means delinquent girl.

1939
02:06:01,720 --> 02:06:03,720
Interesting.

1940
02:06:03,720 --> 02:06:04,720
Or boss girl.

1941
02:06:04,720 --> 02:06:07,720
So is the game like naughty cat? Oh, that would be amazing.

1942
02:06:07,720 --> 02:06:17,720
So, well, I knew that has something to do with the girl because it's like I know characters who've been in series that have like Sukeban Dekka.

1943
02:06:17,720 --> 02:06:26,720
It has to do with like a delinquent girl who uses a yo-yo as a weapon or like a female gang leader, you know, for a school gang, you know.

1944
02:06:26,720 --> 02:06:35,720
So I'm guessing it's sort of like female boss cat Renna or female boss Renna.

1945
02:06:35,720 --> 02:06:37,720
Cat's not actually in the name.

1946
02:06:37,720 --> 02:06:38,720
Interesting.

1947
02:06:38,720 --> 02:06:39,720
So.

1948
02:06:39,720 --> 02:06:44,720
All right. Well, if they should download the show and listen to it, just know we've decided that that should be the name of the game.

1949
02:06:44,720 --> 02:06:48,720
All right. Anyhow, a couple more news stories for you.

1950
02:06:48,720 --> 02:06:52,720
And then the Skype line to say your piece on anything about tonight.

1951
02:06:52,720 --> 02:06:57,720
What says something on Twitter said that means boss cat boss.

1952
02:06:57,720 --> 02:07:02,720
Thank you. Akuma J.P. I'm so glad he's still listening, even though Justin TV hasn't been around for a while.

1953
02:07:02,720 --> 02:07:05,720
He's like the ambassador we need right now.

1954
02:07:05,720 --> 02:07:11,720
Plus, did you notice his little icon is him looking up just like Obama would.

1955
02:07:11,720 --> 02:07:14,720
Thank you, Akuma J.P. All right.

1956
02:07:14,720 --> 02:07:25,720
Let's get to a couple more stories and then we'll get to the Skype line at 1877 Game OLR for some stories.

1957
02:07:25,720 --> 02:07:27,720
Let's talk something else about.

1958
02:07:27,720 --> 02:07:28,720
Let's see.

1959
02:07:28,720 --> 02:07:34,720
We've got the possibility of a new DS on the horizon, which is interesting.

1960
02:07:34,720 --> 02:07:45,720
There's a rumor that the new Nvidia Tegra chip is going into the next generation DS system, seeing as it just did the DSi.

1961
02:07:45,720 --> 02:07:46,720
Whatever.

1962
02:07:46,720 --> 02:07:48,720
Guess you get to buy DS again.

1963
02:07:48,720 --> 02:07:56,720
And it's interesting because apparently it's going to be similar to the one that's like in the Zune HD.

1964
02:07:56,720 --> 02:08:04,720
And what's interesting though is it's got a really high clock speed compared to what the DSi is right now.

1965
02:08:04,720 --> 02:08:14,720
Because the Tegra APX has a clock speed of 600 MHz, whereas the DS cores right now run at 67 and 33 MHz.

1966
02:08:14,720 --> 02:08:21,720
And they believe that there's a potential that it could be GeForce 9-based hardware.

1967
02:08:21,720 --> 02:08:27,720
And if it's cheap enough, Nintendo might consider it their next DS system, possibly an announcement.

1968
02:08:27,720 --> 02:08:29,720
Maybe in another E3.

1969
02:08:29,720 --> 02:08:32,720
Maybe not next year, but the year after.

1970
02:08:32,720 --> 02:08:33,720
I don't know.

1971
02:08:33,720 --> 02:08:34,720
It's interesting.

1972
02:08:34,720 --> 02:08:40,720
It'd be interesting to see them being on the cutting edge of portable systems since their systems usually kind of...

1973
02:08:40,720 --> 02:08:41,720
I don't know.

1974
02:08:41,720 --> 02:08:42,720
Well, let's see.

1975
02:08:42,720 --> 02:08:46,720
I mean, the last system was emulating like Nintendo 64 games.

1976
02:08:46,720 --> 02:08:49,720
So this next handheld system should be like a GameCube in my pocket.

1977
02:08:49,720 --> 02:08:50,720
Yeah.

1978
02:08:50,720 --> 02:08:51,720
It's interesting.

1979
02:08:51,720 --> 02:08:52,720
Oh, President Cat.

1980
02:08:52,720 --> 02:08:53,720
Wait, would you say it?

1981
02:08:53,720 --> 02:08:59,720
They just posted again to all of us saying, really, I can't believe it, kind people, I'm impressed.

1982
02:08:59,720 --> 02:09:02,720
And great name, thank you.

1983
02:09:02,720 --> 02:09:04,720
So they like President Cat.

1984
02:09:04,720 --> 02:09:06,720
I like it too.

1985
02:09:06,720 --> 02:09:08,720
Chat room, quick poll.

1986
02:09:08,720 --> 02:09:09,720
Lost Cat or President Cat?

1987
02:09:09,720 --> 02:09:12,720
Who would buy a game called President Cat?

1988
02:09:12,720 --> 02:09:17,720
And as soon as that game comes, I'm taking a picture of my cat holding the game.

1989
02:09:17,720 --> 02:09:21,720
I'm going to take a picture of Shermie with it too.

1990
02:09:21,720 --> 02:09:26,720
I'm telling you, we are going to flood these people with USA love because what we're doing...

1991
02:09:26,720 --> 02:09:34,720
This poor guy does not know what they're in for because we're going to flood them with this stuff so they can take it to their people and say,

1992
02:09:34,720 --> 02:09:38,720
look, the US is crazy about President Cat.

1993
02:09:38,720 --> 02:09:39,720
We need to get them.

1994
02:09:39,720 --> 02:09:46,720
And then they'll be like, what's President Cat?

1995
02:09:46,720 --> 02:09:49,720
This is the show is the win.

1996
02:09:49,720 --> 02:09:52,720
Rob, when you put this show up, subtitle it President Cat.

1997
02:09:52,720 --> 02:09:54,720
I'm not even going to put a description.

1998
02:09:54,720 --> 02:09:58,720
I'm going to say, sorry, this show was dominated by President Cat or something.

1999
02:09:58,720 --> 02:10:03,720
Anyhow, let's see, quick response to our poll in chat room.

2000
02:10:03,720 --> 02:10:15,720
Do want, arrow pointing at name, I would, yo, I will, stuff on my President Cat, I would, now, ten copies, I would, my cat wants it, I will buy a hundred copies.

2001
02:10:15,720 --> 02:10:18,720
Nove Dea is buying copies for her cats.

2002
02:10:18,720 --> 02:10:22,720
I haven't even played my Wii in over a year, but if I can get this game, I'll break that trend.

2003
02:10:22,720 --> 02:10:31,720
And my favorite from M.A. Satsuma, President Cat is purrfect.

2004
02:10:31,720 --> 02:10:32,720
That's beautiful.

2005
02:10:32,720 --> 02:10:42,720
I knew what I'm just hoping though is that I'm hoping that at least this game isn't all like written that there's like vocal track with it because then I could play it.

2006
02:10:42,720 --> 02:10:46,720
Because I read like, seriously, I read like a five year old.

2007
02:10:46,720 --> 02:10:48,720
I know my numbers in a few other countries.

2008
02:10:48,720 --> 02:10:49,720
I just love the action.

2009
02:10:49,720 --> 02:10:51,720
I'm just worried the game sucks.

2010
02:10:51,720 --> 02:10:53,720
I don't care at this point.

2011
02:10:53,720 --> 02:10:55,720
I don't care.

2012
02:10:55,720 --> 02:10:57,720
It doesn't matter.

2013
02:10:57,720 --> 02:10:59,720
How can this?

2014
02:10:59,720 --> 02:11:01,720
Uh oh, what?

2015
02:11:01,720 --> 02:11:13,720
Uh, pod culture, Brad just became Rina Wee's 100th follower. We doubled their followership.

2016
02:11:13,720 --> 02:11:15,720
I love this show.

2017
02:11:15,720 --> 02:11:17,720
Some days I hate it, today I love it.

2018
02:11:17,720 --> 02:11:22,720
I mean seriously, okay, Wii music was put out by Nintendo.

2019
02:11:22,720 --> 02:11:25,720
Sucked balls.

2020
02:11:25,720 --> 02:11:26,720
Why?

2021
02:11:26,720 --> 02:11:29,720
Because it did not have a cat playing the piano.

2022
02:11:29,720 --> 02:11:31,720
And I'm sorry, it doesn't matter.

2023
02:11:31,720 --> 02:11:33,720
The game is going to be awesome.

2024
02:11:33,720 --> 02:11:42,720
And yes, I understand it's no Metroid Prime, it's no Conduit or whatever, it's not even a Super Mario Galaxy, but you know what?

2025
02:11:42,720 --> 02:11:46,720
It's a motherfucking cat playing a motherfucking piano, what else do you need?

2026
02:11:46,720 --> 02:11:54,720
They have games out there based on like Moomin, which is like some, I don't even know what it is, it's some character from Europe somewhere.

2027
02:11:54,720 --> 02:11:59,720
It's just, then we need this game. I'm sorry, we need this game.

2028
02:11:59,720 --> 02:12:02,720
I agree, we need it. We need it.

2029
02:12:02,720 --> 02:12:09,720
Alright, anyhow, one more story for you guys, then we're going to open up the Skypline and I can't wait to get to the calls tonight.

2030
02:12:09,720 --> 02:12:13,720
Castlevania, the Adventure Rebirth, more information has been announced.

2031
02:12:13,720 --> 02:12:15,720
This is a game, of course, heading to WiiWare.

2032
02:12:15,720 --> 02:12:23,720
It's been a Wii heavy show, we haven't had a lot of Nintendo news in a long time, but yes, of course, Castlevania Adventure Rebirth, this was one of the games that was spoiled from the ESRB database.

2033
02:12:23,720 --> 02:12:30,720
It is true, Konami hasn't really announced it, but we know it's true because you know what, it showed up in a magazine this week in Japan.

2034
02:12:30,720 --> 02:12:38,720
It's coming out October 27th for a thousand Wii points, and hopefully it's going to come here in time, maybe for Halloween, that's what they're thinking at this point is coming out in Japan.

2035
02:12:38,720 --> 02:12:39,720
It looks sexy.

2036
02:12:39,720 --> 02:12:40,720
It looks very sexy.

2037
02:12:40,720 --> 02:12:44,720
It's a Game Boy game originally, but they just completely remade it, it's now in color.

2038
02:12:44,720 --> 02:12:54,720
It looks a little more, to me, like the 16-bit era, like it looks like the Castlevania 4, Super Castlevania 4, but like, I don't know, this is going to be cool.

2039
02:12:54,720 --> 02:13:05,720
It will have new arrangements of classic Castlevania music, yes, and like the other Rebirth games that they did, they are going for a faithful 16-bit look.

2040
02:13:05,720 --> 02:13:08,720
What are you screaming laughing about there, over there, DarkSakura?

2041
02:13:08,720 --> 02:13:17,720
I'm just looking at all of the last 50 followers of Reno E, and it's all of us.

2042
02:13:17,720 --> 02:13:18,720
I love it, I love it.

2043
02:13:18,720 --> 02:13:22,720
Anyhow, can we move on?

2044
02:13:22,720 --> 02:13:24,720
I'm sorry, this is fantastic.

2045
02:13:24,720 --> 02:13:26,720
No, it's funny.

2046
02:13:26,720 --> 02:13:32,720
Tonight has just been a very special show, and it's about to get more special-er, as if there was such a thing.

2047
02:13:32,720 --> 02:13:38,720
1877 Game OLR is the Skype line, or our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.

2048
02:13:38,720 --> 02:13:41,720
Let's get to the calls. Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio, who's this?

2049
02:13:41,720 --> 02:13:44,720
This is DS Master 26.

2050
02:13:44,720 --> 02:13:49,720
DS Master, we're asking everybody tonight, President Cat, is it awesome, are we overdoing it?

2051
02:13:49,720 --> 02:13:50,720
Yes, I would buy it.

2052
02:13:50,720 --> 02:13:53,720
I would too. Alright, what's on your mind tonight?

2053
02:13:53,720 --> 02:13:57,720
Oh shit, Skype crashed again.

2054
02:13:57,720 --> 02:13:59,720
Son of a bitch.

2055
02:13:59,720 --> 02:14:02,720
Skype did that last week too, didn't it?

2056
02:14:02,720 --> 02:14:04,720
Bad Skype.

2057
02:14:04,720 --> 02:14:15,720
Alright, well, this is when, this is one of those rare cases where we will actually call somebody back, because he did get through fair and square, so we're gonna call him.

2058
02:14:15,720 --> 02:14:18,720
I don't know what the hell, Skype did this last week too, remember?

2059
02:14:18,720 --> 02:14:20,720
It's just being retarded.

2060
02:14:20,720 --> 02:14:26,720
Tigerclaw asked if I've updated it, you know what, I probably haven't, especially not tonight, because we ran in studio very late tonight.

2061
02:14:26,720 --> 02:14:28,720
Hi, DS Master, are you back?

2062
02:14:28,720 --> 02:14:32,720
Yeah, sorry, I think it's something with my PSP 2000 here.

2063
02:14:32,720 --> 02:14:33,720
No, no, it's us.

2064
02:14:33,720 --> 02:14:35,720
I'm gonna try to log into my 3000 call you.

2065
02:14:35,720 --> 02:14:38,720
Hello? DS Master, it's us, Skype crashed on our end.

2066
02:14:38,720 --> 02:14:39,720
Um, what's on your mind?

2067
02:14:39,720 --> 02:14:40,720
Oh, it's your end?

2068
02:14:40,720 --> 02:14:42,720
Yeah, it was our end. What's on your mind tonight?

2069
02:14:42,720 --> 02:14:49,720
Um, not much, other than I will buy President Cat when it comes out.

2070
02:14:49,720 --> 02:14:59,720
Other than that, um, I'm here to review, my friend got an early copy of Sixteen Empress.

2071
02:14:59,720 --> 02:15:00,720
Please go for it.

2072
02:15:00,720 --> 02:15:02,720
It's epic.

2073
02:15:02,720 --> 02:15:09,720
Tell us a little bit about the game for those that don't know, because remember not everybody that listens to this show is from the Bamani days.

2074
02:15:09,720 --> 02:15:22,720
Well, we were kind of thinking since this is going to be the last BeatMania for PS2, we might as well get it. And of course I don't have the phone of cash lying around, so uh, you know, my friend bought it.

2075
02:15:22,720 --> 02:15:28,720
And so, you know, he showed me some videos and whatever, and I thought this was kind of cool.

2076
02:15:28,720 --> 02:15:42,720
And now with DJ Hero coming out, the question is, is that going to, you know, is that going to be the competition in Konami to run for their money along with Scratch DJ?

2077
02:15:42,720 --> 02:15:53,720
Do you think this is going to, you know, blow off the BeatMania fans to go get the DJ Heroes and Scratch games for the world?

2078
02:15:53,720 --> 02:16:00,720
Well, let's not forget these games aren't here in the U.S. I mean, those that are buying this game are not supporting anything in the U.S.

2079
02:16:00,720 --> 02:16:07,720
You're supporting Konami of Japan, but you're not really supporting anything here, and I don't believe DJ Hero is out in Japan anytime soon. Right, Loki? Do you know?

2080
02:16:07,720 --> 02:16:08,720
I don't know.

2081
02:16:08,720 --> 02:16:09,720
I don't think it would be anytime soon.

2082
02:16:09,720 --> 02:16:10,720
Probably not.

2083
02:16:10,720 --> 02:16:16,720
So the two games really aren't competing against each other. I know a lot of the Bamani community wants to think it is, but they're really not.

2084
02:16:16,720 --> 02:16:26,720
Because we all know that DJ Hero will come out in Japan soon, because Guitar Hero is out in Japan, I mean, as far as the On Tour games, as far as I know.

2085
02:16:26,720 --> 02:16:28,720
That would be true. I'll give you that.

2086
02:16:28,720 --> 02:16:36,720
And some of me thinking, this is the competition for the Guitar Freaks, Drummanias, and especially with Rockman out there now, too.

2087
02:16:36,720 --> 02:16:46,720
So, Konami tried Rock Revolution, that was a crap shame, as we all know. And this, I think, may be their final nail in the coffin.

2088
02:16:46,720 --> 02:16:58,720
It doesn't say when it's going to be out over there, but it says October 2009 is the release date for DJ Hero over there, so it very well could be coming out around the same time, although, I don't know.

2089
02:16:58,720 --> 02:17:03,720
Alright, well, DS Master, do you have anything else, quickly, before we let you go?

2090
02:17:03,720 --> 02:17:15,720
Um, other than to say, I give Sixteen Empress, you know, since I'm a factor, it's probably the last beatme for the PS2, because I'm waiting for a PS3 launch before I actually buy one of those consoles.

2091
02:17:15,720 --> 02:17:22,720
Um, I, it's, in the point of President Cat, it's purrrrfect.

2092
02:17:22,720 --> 02:17:30,720
It is purrrfect, and Skype just crashed again, so if you can hear me, Skype crashed again.

2093
02:17:30,720 --> 02:17:36,720
I don't know what the hell is going on tonight, but Skype crashed again, so sorry to DS Master 26, but at least he got his thoughts out.

2094
02:17:36,720 --> 02:17:39,720
So, live radio, unfortunately, this kind of stuff is going to happen.

2095
02:17:39,720 --> 02:17:40,720
We got another reply from Rina Wee.

2096
02:17:40,720 --> 02:17:41,720
What happened now?

2097
02:17:41,720 --> 02:17:43,720
It says she has a bit of the queen type.

2098
02:17:43,720 --> 02:17:45,720
So maybe it's Queen Cat?

2099
02:17:45,720 --> 02:17:46,720
Queen Cat.

2100
02:17:46,720 --> 02:17:49,720
I don't know if Queen Cat, I think President Cat has a better ring to it.

2101
02:17:49,720 --> 02:17:50,720
Boss Cat.

2102
02:17:50,720 --> 02:17:51,720
Or Boss Cat?

2103
02:17:51,720 --> 02:17:53,720
The boss of the cats in the house.

2104
02:17:53,720 --> 02:18:00,720
Almost like Top Cat. But if you saw these games on the shelf, which one would jump out to you? I think President Cat would jump out to you.

2105
02:18:00,720 --> 02:18:02,720
That shows a little bit of the US flair to it, right?

2106
02:18:02,720 --> 02:18:03,720
Mmm.

2107
02:18:03,720 --> 02:18:06,720
Because in Japan, they don't have a president, they have a prime minister, correct?

2108
02:18:06,720 --> 02:18:13,720
Yeah, but I think that when it comes to representing the game, you're not actually being a president president, but, you know. Anyway.

2109
02:18:13,720 --> 02:18:16,720
Alright, let's go to another call. Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this?

2110
02:18:16,720 --> 02:18:19,720
Hi, this is Ray Ayanami.

2111
02:18:19,720 --> 02:18:23,720
Hi, Ray Ayanami. Hey, quickly, we're polling all of our callers tonight.

2112
02:18:23,720 --> 02:18:29,720
If President Cat was released in the US, would you buy it, or do we need to shut the hell up?

2113
02:18:29,720 --> 02:18:31,720
Um, sorry, why the hell not?

2114
02:18:31,720 --> 02:18:35,720
Have you not been listening to the show tonight?

2115
02:18:35,720 --> 02:18:41,720
I have been, I just didn't go to a gentle party, since I was busy with homework and such.

2116
02:18:41,720 --> 02:18:46,720
Oh, okay, well then we'll give you a buy. Well, what's on your mind tonight?

2117
02:18:46,720 --> 02:18:52,720
So, I've been looking at the 2D shooters, like, this decade, and I've been noticing a recent trend.

2118
02:18:52,720 --> 02:18:58,720
Like, they need to have, like, a bullet hell shooter with lots of cutesy anime characters.

2119
02:18:58,720 --> 02:19:03,720
And it's kind of getting me worried about the 2D shooter genre.

2120
02:19:03,720 --> 02:19:05,720
Mm-hmm.

2121
02:19:05,720 --> 02:19:25,720
This means that, like, more traditional shooters with starships made out of characters are being phased out, and I have friends who are mostly into stuff like Toho, and Psych Witches, and Death Moth, and all the other...

2122
02:19:25,720 --> 02:19:27,720
...Moet, Moet shooters.

2123
02:19:27,720 --> 02:19:33,720
And I was feeling that if I were to show them something like archives or something of the force, they'd probably say no.

2124
02:19:33,720 --> 02:19:49,720
And one offer, them playing whatever they want, it makes you realize, in the future, it's all we're ever going to see of shooters, and it'd be nothing but cutesy bullet hell shooters that are all, like, cropping topics of each other.

2125
02:19:49,720 --> 02:19:56,720
Let's say you were a game designer. What would you do to make a 2D shooter interesting?

2126
02:19:56,720 --> 02:20:13,720
Mm-hmm. Interesting is in, like, for people to, like, make a shooter that was more of the aforementioned traditional shooter, like, how to make it more interesting.

2127
02:20:13,720 --> 02:20:16,720
I'm sorry, I missed that. What?

2128
02:20:16,720 --> 02:20:23,720
Wait, what do you mean by how to make a shooter interesting is how to design a shooter?

2129
02:20:23,720 --> 02:20:33,720
Like, because, you know, you kind of are saying that a lot of the games are kind of copies of each other, so what would you do to kind of break the mold?

2130
02:20:33,720 --> 02:20:56,720
Well, because as I mentioned, I want to make more shooters that are, like, they don't have lots of worlds, but it's something that makes the game challenging to other than really pretty board patterns, like, kind of more of a sort of more traditional shooter, like Gradius Rebirth.

2131
02:20:56,720 --> 02:21:05,720
Gradius Rebirth is pretty cool. I like these Rebirth series that Konami is doing recently. Did you just hear us talking about Castlevania Rebirth?

2132
02:21:05,720 --> 02:21:07,720
Yeah, I did.

2133
02:21:07,720 --> 02:21:12,720
What do you think of that? Is that going to be interesting? I know it's not a shooter, but I figure you're a fan of that series, too.

2134
02:21:12,720 --> 02:21:32,720
Yeah, I'm a Castlevania fan, too. I've played most of the Metroidvania and some of the older Castlevania games, but I'm going to give it a shot. It depends on what elements it decides to borrow from past games.

2135
02:21:32,720 --> 02:21:43,720
All right. Well, we're going to let you go, buddy, so we can get some more calls, but do yourself a favor. Listen to Part A tonight, because we're just crazy tonight, all right? Take care, buddy.

2136
02:21:43,720 --> 02:21:52,720
1-877-GAME-OLR, username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio. We're going to take your calls right now, and of course we are polling all the callers tonight about President and Cat.

2137
02:21:52,720 --> 02:21:55,720
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this?

2138
02:21:55,720 --> 02:21:57,720
Hi, this is Spazinator.

2139
02:21:57,720 --> 02:21:59,720
Hey, Spazinator. How you doing?

2140
02:21:59,720 --> 02:22:04,720
Oh, pretty good, Huck. How's everything over in President Cantland?

2141
02:22:04,720 --> 02:22:11,720
Yes, wonderful, and we have to ask you, are you interested in buying President and Cat, or are we making too big of a deal out of it?

2142
02:22:11,720 --> 02:22:25,720
I might get it, assuming that I ever do get a Wii. That's the only current council I don't have yet, but I may get a Wii just for President and Cat.

2143
02:22:25,720 --> 02:22:29,720
All right, I'm just going to put you down as a yes. All right, what's on your mind tonight?

2144
02:22:29,720 --> 02:22:45,720
Yeah, I don't know if you saw one of my earlier tweets today before your show went live, but I have asked the three of you if you have seen Detuned on PlayStation Network Store yet.

2145
02:22:45,720 --> 02:22:50,720
I have not seen this, but I know you were tweeting some things about it. What's this all about?

2146
02:22:50,720 --> 02:23:05,720
It simply puts like a cross between Linger and Shadows, which has been on the store forever, and music visualizer.

2147
02:23:05,720 --> 02:23:27,720
It's kind of both of two things together, and that's what Detuned is. It's not actually a game, it's part art and part music visualizer, and like any other game for the PS3, it also has trophies.

2148
02:23:27,720 --> 02:23:46,720
So if you're kind of like bored of your music visualizers on the PS3, and you need something else to look at, if you're a trophy whore, then I suggest getting it to Detuned.

2149
02:23:46,720 --> 02:23:49,720
Is there a demo that I can check out?

2150
02:23:49,720 --> 02:24:00,720
Not yet, but I would imagine that probably they may come up with one soon. When exactly, I don't know.

2151
02:24:00,720 --> 02:24:05,720
I'm trying to see if maybe there's like a YouTube or something I can kind of check out here.

2152
02:24:05,720 --> 02:24:16,720
I'm looking, I actually just loaded up somebody's video that looks like they shot their TV to show this game, and I'm trying to look at a little bit of the game in action here, so I can kind of see what it looks like.

2153
02:24:16,720 --> 02:24:28,720
But this looks like a very, oh this looks crazy. Dude, there's like elephant, maybe President Cat needs to go to PlayStation Network. Seriously, if this game's on it, I don't know.

2154
02:24:28,720 --> 02:24:29,720
What the heck?

2155
02:24:29,720 --> 02:24:57,720
Yeah, and also, the other thing I mentioned in the same tweet is that I know you kind of talked on it earlier on, and I know you're not exactly the type of gamer, but you know, I'm tired too with one of the more recent games I got, and I swear to God, it is pretty good.

2156
02:24:57,720 --> 02:25:13,720
And you know, if you like, you know, the Indiana Jones type of stuff, you know, I would suggest getting it.

2157
02:25:13,720 --> 02:25:24,720
You know, you're seeing that every major company out there that does reviews gave it basically purpose.

2158
02:25:24,720 --> 02:25:34,720
I know, I saw. The reviews are nothing but positive. I'm sure the game's great, it's just, you know, I don't usually play those type of games, but I probably will check it out right after I get President Cat, okay?

2159
02:25:34,720 --> 02:25:35,720
Sure.

2160
02:25:35,720 --> 02:25:39,720
All right. Take care, buddy. We're going to let you go so we can get some more calls. Have a good one.

2161
02:25:39,720 --> 02:25:40,720
I have to hear that.

2162
02:25:40,720 --> 02:25:41,720
Yes, you too.

2163
02:25:41,720 --> 02:25:46,720
Later. 1877 game, OLR. Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this?

2164
02:25:46,720 --> 02:25:47,720
It's Legend of Zaku.

2165
02:25:47,720 --> 02:25:51,720
Zaku, you know what I'm going to ask you first. President Cat, yay or nay?

2166
02:25:51,720 --> 02:25:56,720
If he offers as much change as Obama, then yay.

2167
02:25:56,720 --> 02:25:59,720
All right, I'm all for it. What's on your mind tonight?

2168
02:25:59,720 --> 02:26:06,720
Nothing much, just trying to reflect on this weekend. Obviously, I popped my Rocky Horror Picture Show cherry last night.

2169
02:26:06,720 --> 02:26:08,720
Did you really? What did you think?

2170
02:26:08,720 --> 02:26:11,720
First of all, how did you get de-virginized?

2171
02:26:11,720 --> 02:26:15,720
Let's say I had to fake an orgasm.

2172
02:26:15,720 --> 02:26:16,720
Nice.

2173
02:26:16,720 --> 02:26:17,720
That's pretty standard.

2174
02:26:17,720 --> 02:26:22,720
At least you didn't have to do the Twinkie or Banana Blowjob.

2175
02:26:22,720 --> 02:26:25,720
Did you have a good time?

2176
02:26:25,720 --> 02:26:27,720
It was pretty good, to be honest with you.

2177
02:26:27,720 --> 02:26:38,720
Aside from that, I'm just mulling over the bullshit decision that Infinity Ward made over the weekend regarding Modern Warfare 2 PC.

2178
02:26:38,720 --> 02:26:40,720
And what's that?

2179
02:26:40,720 --> 02:26:51,720
Killing off dedicated servers, basically making the whole game a living hell for clans and the ability to mob the hell out of it.

2180
02:26:51,720 --> 02:26:55,720
This seems to be a trend this year with PC games.

2181
02:26:55,720 --> 02:27:00,720
The only reason why I say that is because remember what a hissy fit everybody went into over Starcraft 2?

2182
02:27:00,720 --> 02:27:02,720
You can't play on LANs right now.

2183
02:27:02,720 --> 02:27:09,720
It seems like all these game companies want to centralize things on their own servers for various reasons.

2184
02:27:09,720 --> 02:27:16,720
It's not even that. It's just that they're introducing matchmaking as an integral part of Modern Warfare 2.

2185
02:27:16,720 --> 02:27:22,720
Basically bringing it down to the level of consoles.

2186
02:27:22,720 --> 02:27:25,720
Not that it hasn't been done already.

2187
02:27:25,720 --> 02:27:35,720
Left 4 Dead does it, but what I hear is not as severe or drastic as what Infinity Ward is trying to do.

2188
02:27:35,720 --> 02:27:47,720
And that worries me right now because if you have no means of setting up dedicated servers and you have to rely on other people's connections, it'll just be like Xbox Live.

2189
02:27:47,720 --> 02:27:55,720
And it basically kills off any aspect of gaming, playing against more than 16 people at the same time.

2190
02:27:55,720 --> 02:28:08,720
The fact of the matter is that dedicated servers pretty much has always been the norm for PC games for the most part.

2191
02:28:08,720 --> 02:28:14,720
Growing up playing on Quake 2 for example on dedicated servers.

2192
02:28:14,720 --> 02:28:18,720
I don't know, I guess they're going ass backwards.

2193
02:28:18,720 --> 02:28:27,720
I guess it's worse being regressive regarding this. And it's pissing off a lot of people. A lot of people canceling their pre-orders.

2194
02:28:27,720 --> 02:28:35,720
So either that or they're being kept in the dark regarding this.

2195
02:28:35,720 --> 02:28:39,720
My god, are you tearing your computer apart during the show?

2196
02:28:39,720 --> 02:28:51,720
No, no, no. I was going to get Modern Warfare 2, but after reading this I'm kind of questioning that notion of actually investing in that game.

2197
02:28:51,720 --> 02:28:56,720
It's tough for me, Zaku, because you know Modern Warfare isn't the type of game I would usually play.

2198
02:28:56,720 --> 02:29:03,720
But obviously I know it's going to be epic, especially for fans of that genre. I'm not going to knock it because it sets trends.

2199
02:29:03,720 --> 02:29:11,720
But I can see where people are getting a little irritated, but really you're going to go without the game completely when it's going to be this year's biggest game?

2200
02:29:11,720 --> 02:29:19,720
I understand that it's supposed to be Halo and all the other games.

2201
02:29:19,720 --> 02:29:31,720
But when you basically cut off the bread and butter of most clans and the fact that they won't allow me to play with the same regular people.

2202
02:29:31,720 --> 02:29:35,720
As I normally would if I find a good decent server for that game.

2203
02:29:35,720 --> 02:29:41,720
And I have to play with just some random Joe Shmuck, whoever the hell is at my level.

2204
02:29:41,720 --> 02:29:48,720
It kind of turns me off. I went through the same thing when playing Call of Duty 4 on 360.

2205
02:29:48,720 --> 02:30:00,720
It was just a lot of ass hattery and it just didn't feel right when I should be playing that game on my PC with a decent server where everyone at least knows who you are.

2206
02:30:00,720 --> 02:30:05,720
Alright. Zaku, any quick thoughts before we move on to some more calls?

2207
02:30:05,720 --> 02:30:14,720
Infinity Ward needs to either release more information or just really rethink about what they just said, about what they're planning to do.

2208
02:30:14,720 --> 02:30:20,720
Because they've already lost one sale out of probably thousands if not millions.

2209
02:30:20,720 --> 02:30:22,720
At least that's money you can invest in, President Cat.

2210
02:30:22,720 --> 02:30:25,720
Alright, take care Zaku. Have a good night.

2211
02:30:25,720 --> 02:30:26,720
Have a good one.

2212
02:30:26,720 --> 02:30:32,720
Speaking of President Cat, the updates keep coming. They're trying to explain to us what it is.

2213
02:30:32,720 --> 02:30:37,720
And basically they tweeted us to this Google image search that shows us what the Sukeban is.

2214
02:30:37,720 --> 02:30:39,720
That was Yo-Yo Cop Girl.

2215
02:30:39,720 --> 02:30:45,720
That's completely mistranslated. Sukeban, that's a word I knew.

2216
02:30:45,720 --> 02:30:49,720
Because like I said, it means a boss girl. And that's the typical look.

2217
02:30:49,720 --> 02:30:52,720
Rob, did you ever play Project Justice?

2218
02:30:52,720 --> 02:30:53,720
No.

2219
02:30:53,720 --> 02:31:00,720
Well there's a character in that called Zaki who wore the long skirt and everything with her uniform.

2220
02:31:00,720 --> 02:31:03,720
And it's like a girl gang leader.

2221
02:31:03,720 --> 02:31:09,720
So maybe they need to call the game Mistress Cat because these look like a mistress.

2222
02:31:09,720 --> 02:31:15,720
But I just like the name President Cat and I do want to point out in all these pictures, look at the colors the Sukeban are wearing.

2223
02:31:15,720 --> 02:31:18,720
Red, white, and blue. Am I right? Am I right?

2224
02:31:18,720 --> 02:31:20,720
That's just typical uniform colors though.

2225
02:31:20,720 --> 02:31:24,720
Coincidence or not, it's funny and adds to the cause. I still like the name President Cat.

2226
02:31:24,720 --> 02:31:30,720
At any rate, I think the best way to describe the title of the game is basically we've been going and I said,

2227
02:31:30,720 --> 02:31:34,720
oh she controls the house and they were going, no she controls the office.

2228
02:31:34,720 --> 02:31:41,720
So I think it's like she is sort of like the real leader of the office. You know what I mean?

2229
02:31:41,720 --> 02:31:48,720
Like Shermie is the real princess of the house. She inserts her own control over the house.

2230
02:31:48,720 --> 02:31:51,720
More calls at 1-877-GAME-OLR.

2231
02:31:51,720 --> 02:31:55,720
Loki, do you have any last minute stories? I see you looking at something about...

2232
02:31:55,720 --> 02:31:58,720
Oh, I was just doing search for the cat thing and there's someone talking about it.

2233
02:31:58,720 --> 02:32:04,720
They thought it was a Dreamcast game. It's the NTSC-UK forums.

2234
02:32:04,720 --> 02:32:11,720
We're talking about the cat game. They call it the Dreamcast Cat game because it has a little Dreamcast swirl on it.

2235
02:32:11,720 --> 02:32:13,720
Spirals on our cheeks for the blush.

2236
02:32:13,720 --> 02:32:16,720
Well did you respond and say it's fucking President Cat? Now salute.

2237
02:32:16,720 --> 02:32:22,720
No, I didn't say that. However, I did notice that there was someone that posted on the Game Facts forum,

2238
02:32:22,720 --> 02:32:30,720
the only post, I suspect, to act deaf, that said President Cat for 2012, you know what you want or something.

2239
02:32:30,720 --> 02:32:36,720
I love that idea. Go flood the Game Facts forums with President Cat love. Please.

2240
02:32:36,720 --> 02:32:39,720
That is the most awesome Suki Bhandeka picture ever.

2241
02:32:39,720 --> 02:32:44,720
And I understand that, you know, President Cat isn't necessarily what it translates into,

2242
02:32:44,720 --> 02:32:52,720
but, you know, bossy or authoritative, you know, female cat just doesn't have the same ring as President Cat.

2243
02:32:52,720 --> 02:32:54,720
And the president of a company, CEO Cat, I mean...

2244
02:32:54,720 --> 02:32:58,720
Yeah, exactly. I think President Cat has the best ring to it. We'll see what happens.

2245
02:32:58,720 --> 02:33:00,720
You could do Company President Cat.

2246
02:33:00,720 --> 02:33:05,720
All right. I don't think we're getting any other calls. Do we have any... Oh, sorry.

2247
02:33:05,720 --> 02:33:07,720
Grand Empress Cat.

2248
02:33:07,720 --> 02:33:08,720
All right.

2249
02:33:08,720 --> 02:33:10,720
Loki, do you have any last minute stories?

2250
02:33:10,720 --> 02:33:19,720
So, just like they did with the NHL, EA is bringing Madden NFL Arcade to Xbox Live Arcade and PlayStation Network.

2251
02:33:19,720 --> 02:33:24,720
It will be a five-on-five football game with kind of like a backyard scenario.

2252
02:33:24,720 --> 02:33:29,720
They say the first of 30, four plays per progression, no penalties, no field goals.

2253
02:33:29,720 --> 02:33:35,720
And that'll be coming for $15 in some time in December.

2254
02:33:35,720 --> 02:33:41,720
Also, Nice America wants to bring A Holy Invasion of Privacy Bad Man to UMD.

2255
02:33:41,720 --> 02:33:47,720
Ironically enough, this game was originally going to come out in UMD, but for whatever reason, it got cock-blocked into download only.

2256
02:33:47,720 --> 02:33:54,720
But they're looking for 1,000 fans to basically promise that they're going to pre-order the game.

2257
02:33:54,720 --> 02:34:00,720
And if you do that, by November 13th, they will bring out the game.

2258
02:34:00,720 --> 02:34:01,720
Interesting.

2259
02:34:01,720 --> 02:34:08,720
Yes. Apparently, third-party publishers are not required to release PSP games on the PlayStation Store.

2260
02:34:08,720 --> 02:34:12,720
All the more reason that you have the option of buying a UMD game.

2261
02:34:12,720 --> 02:34:17,720
And that's why you need to own a PlayStation 3, or PSP 3000 and not a Go.

2262
02:34:17,720 --> 02:34:20,720
But, you know, hey, you're just limiting your options.

2263
02:34:20,720 --> 02:34:27,720
Finally, Borderlands, a game that hasn't even come out yet, is already getting its first bit of download content.

2264
02:34:27,720 --> 02:34:33,720
It's almost kind of tying in with, you know, the, I guess, Halloween season.

2265
02:34:33,720 --> 02:34:40,720
But the Zombie Island of Dr. Ned, apparently, will be the first bit of download content for $10.

2266
02:34:40,720 --> 02:34:46,720
And it'll be on the PlayStation 3, Windows, and Xbox Live Marketplace.

2267
02:34:46,720 --> 02:34:50,720
And apparently, it's... I don't know what's coming out there.

2268
02:34:50,720 --> 02:34:57,720
I don't know if that's going to be released at launch, or if it's slightly afterwards.

2269
02:34:57,720 --> 02:35:00,720
Yeah, later this year, they say. So, interesting.

2270
02:35:00,720 --> 02:35:03,720
Alright, I got a couple stories that I missed on the Twitter of the Tigerclaw.

2271
02:35:03,720 --> 02:35:05,720
Really wanted me to mention for you guys, so I said sure.

2272
02:35:05,720 --> 02:35:09,720
Because I got, obviously, I've been extremely distracted on Twitter for tonight.

2273
02:35:09,720 --> 02:35:13,720
GameStop has mentioned what the Super Street Fighter IV price and ship date is.

2274
02:35:13,720 --> 02:35:15,720
But remember, this is in their system.

2275
02:35:15,720 --> 02:35:18,720
It doesn't mean it's necessarily 100% true, but it's nice to imagine.

2276
02:35:18,720 --> 02:35:22,720
That it is really going to cost $39.99 on the Xbox 360 or PS3.

2277
02:35:22,720 --> 02:35:27,720
And that the date it's coming, March 23rd, 2010, is the rumored date.

2278
02:35:27,720 --> 02:35:32,720
Also, in related news, I think this was something that was briefly covered on a previous show.

2279
02:35:32,720 --> 02:35:39,720
The Cleveland fan, John Thompson, also known as Big Dog, had recently sued EA.

2280
02:35:39,720 --> 02:35:42,720
Because EA used his likeness in Madden NFL.

2281
02:35:42,720 --> 02:35:45,720
He's one of the super fans that actually dresses up as a dog for the games.

2282
02:35:45,720 --> 02:35:49,720
Yeah, I can't really explain it either, but I'm assuming if you follow football or live in Cleveland,

2283
02:35:49,720 --> 02:35:51,720
you know what I'm talking about.

2284
02:35:51,720 --> 02:35:54,720
He has settled the suit, apparently, $25,000.

2285
02:35:54,720 --> 02:35:57,720
So, there you go.

2286
02:35:57,720 --> 02:36:00,720
I'm sorry, the suit has been settled not necessarily for $25,000.

2287
02:36:00,720 --> 02:36:05,720
That is what he was seeking originally, but we don't know exactly how much it was settled for.

2288
02:36:05,720 --> 02:36:07,720
So, there you go.

2289
02:36:07,720 --> 02:36:09,720
And that's going to do it for Last Minute Stories tonight.

2290
02:36:09,720 --> 02:36:12,720
No other calls on Skypline tonight, so I guess that's it.

2291
02:36:12,720 --> 02:36:14,720
We just have shy callers tonight.

2292
02:36:14,720 --> 02:36:18,720
So, that's going to do it, I guess, for tonight's episode of Orange Launch Radio.

2293
02:36:18,720 --> 02:36:20,720
Thank you guys so much for tuning in to us and supporting our show.

2294
02:36:20,720 --> 02:36:23,720
I know it was a crazy-ass show tonight, but you know what?

2295
02:36:23,720 --> 02:36:25,720
It was fun. It was a lot of fun.

2296
02:36:25,720 --> 02:36:32,720
But I'm just waiting for the backlash to begin on President Cat, but you're a fool if you don't support it.

2297
02:36:32,720 --> 02:36:35,720
Let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts.

2298
02:36:35,720 --> 02:36:36,720
Oh, hey, hey, guess what?

2299
02:36:36,720 --> 02:36:37,720
Oh, God, more?

2300
02:36:37,720 --> 02:36:38,720
Yeah.

2301
02:36:38,720 --> 02:36:46,720
Renna Wee says, yeah, I like to and I think President Cat is better.

2302
02:36:46,720 --> 02:36:48,720
So, they like President Cat.

2303
02:36:48,720 --> 02:36:56,720
So, now I've got a goal to make President Cat a trending topic on Twitter.

2304
02:36:56,720 --> 02:36:57,720
Good luck with that.

2305
02:36:57,720 --> 02:37:02,720
It takes a lot to get a trending topic, but I think the more we can show that, again,

2306
02:37:02,720 --> 02:37:06,720
I'm totally serious about let's use our picture stream for something really useful.

2307
02:37:06,720 --> 02:37:12,720
Send in President Cat fan art, something that we can send to them so they can show people.

2308
02:37:12,720 --> 02:37:13,720
That's how this is going to happen.

2309
02:37:13,720 --> 02:37:20,720
They have to be able to prove to some American publisher that America actually wants this game and that it's not a fucking joke.

2310
02:37:20,720 --> 02:37:21,720
You know what?

2311
02:37:21,720 --> 02:37:22,720
What?

2312
02:37:22,720 --> 02:37:24,720
I think we need to start a Shermie blog.

2313
02:37:24,720 --> 02:37:26,720
I'm serious.

2314
02:37:26,720 --> 02:37:27,720
Shermie needs a Twitter?

2315
02:37:27,720 --> 02:37:28,720
Shermie needs a Twitter.

2316
02:37:28,720 --> 02:37:38,720
Shermie is going to be like – well, no, they have their little blog for their – for Renna, yeah, who is like the boss cat and all the other.

2317
02:37:38,720 --> 02:37:41,720
Seriously, I was just reading this one about this other cat going, oh, you know.

2318
02:37:41,720 --> 02:37:44,720
So, it will be Shermie's goal to get President Cat out in the U.S.?

2319
02:37:44,720 --> 02:37:45,720
Yeah.

2320
02:37:45,720 --> 02:37:54,720
And she can be – or Shermie can be Secretary of Fat because Shermie is a fat cat.

2321
02:37:54,720 --> 02:37:55,720
She is.

2322
02:37:55,720 --> 02:37:56,720
I love my big fat baby.

2323
02:37:56,720 --> 02:37:57,720
But she's awesome.

2324
02:37:57,720 --> 02:37:58,720
My big fat hairy stinky baby.

2325
02:37:58,720 --> 02:38:00,720
And Rama reminds us about the OLR ferret.

2326
02:38:00,720 --> 02:38:02,720
We don't know who started OLR ferret.

2327
02:38:02,720 --> 02:38:04,720
I think it's Jason, but I don't know for sure.

2328
02:38:04,720 --> 02:38:06,720
Like I don't know who OLR ferret is.

2329
02:38:06,720 --> 02:38:07,720
So, it could be Dekeman.

2330
02:38:07,720 --> 02:38:08,720
I don't know.

2331
02:38:08,720 --> 02:38:11,720
It's probably one of our web geeks behind the scenes.

2332
02:38:11,720 --> 02:38:12,720
But we don't know who started that.

2333
02:38:12,720 --> 02:38:15,720
But hopefully, OLR ferret will get in on the cause too.

2334
02:38:15,720 --> 02:38:18,720
Anyhow, you haven't heard the last of President Cat.

2335
02:38:18,720 --> 02:38:23,720
We finally found a cause here on Orange Lounge Radio, one of several causes I'm sure.

2336
02:38:23,720 --> 02:38:26,720
Oh, we got one more call coming through on the Skype line.

2337
02:38:26,720 --> 02:38:28,720
Let's take a call.

2338
02:38:28,720 --> 02:38:29,720
Hi.

2339
02:38:29,720 --> 02:38:30,720
You're on Orange Lounge Radio.

2340
02:38:30,720 --> 02:38:31,720
Who's this?

2341
02:38:31,720 --> 02:38:44,720
Thank you so much for downloading and supporting Orange Lounge Radio.

2342
02:38:44,720 --> 02:38:45,720
Oh, we didn't get everybody's final thought.

2343
02:38:45,720 --> 02:38:46,720
I'm sorry.

2344
02:38:46,720 --> 02:38:48,720
Loki, your final thought.

2345
02:38:48,720 --> 02:38:53,720
My final thought is Daytona.

2346
02:38:53,720 --> 02:38:57,720
DarkSakura, did you have anything else you wanted to add?

2347
02:38:57,720 --> 02:38:58,720
Meow.

2348
02:38:58,720 --> 02:39:01,720
My final thought is President Cat for 2012.

2349
02:39:01,720 --> 02:39:02,720
Actually, 2010.

2350
02:39:02,720 --> 02:39:04,720
We need President Cat a lot sooner.

2351
02:39:04,720 --> 02:39:05,720
Governor Cat in 2010.

2352
02:39:05,720 --> 02:39:07,720
Governor Cat.

2353
02:39:07,720 --> 02:39:12,720
We need President Cat to take over the mafia.

2354
02:39:12,720 --> 02:39:13,720
All right.

2355
02:39:13,720 --> 02:39:14,720
That's going to do it.

2356
02:39:14,720 --> 02:39:16,720
Thank you guys so much for downloading and supporting Internet Radio.

2357
02:39:16,720 --> 02:39:17,720
President Cat.

2358
02:39:17,720 --> 02:39:19,720
And President Cat indirectly.

2359
02:39:19,720 --> 02:39:22,720
Look, guys, honestly, I said it before in a minute.

2360
02:39:22,720 --> 02:39:25,720
There's millions of shows talking about Uncharted 2 this week,

2361
02:39:25,720 --> 02:39:27,720
and we're certainly not hating on the game by any means.

2362
02:39:27,720 --> 02:39:28,720
We're just like you.

2363
02:39:28,720 --> 02:39:30,720
We don't get paid.

2364
02:39:30,720 --> 02:39:31,720
Did somebody put that on our Twitter?

2365
02:39:31,720 --> 02:39:35,720
Ikuma JP put a picture of a kitten dressed up as a Sukeban,

2366
02:39:35,720 --> 02:39:39,720
so I'm going to post that on our Twitter.

2367
02:39:39,720 --> 02:39:40,720
I fucking love it.

2368
02:39:40,720 --> 02:39:41,720
Not the Twitter, but on...

2369
02:39:41,720 --> 02:39:43,720
Place that in chat for chatters.

2370
02:39:43,720 --> 02:39:44,720
Can C, please?

2371
02:39:44,720 --> 02:39:45,720
Thank you.

2372
02:39:45,720 --> 02:39:46,720
God damn, the show's amazing tonight.

2373
02:39:46,720 --> 02:39:47,720
All right.

2374
02:39:47,720 --> 02:39:48,720
Thank you, guys.

2375
02:39:48,720 --> 02:39:50,720
Honestly, I meant it when I said it earlier, you know,

2376
02:39:50,720 --> 02:39:52,720
and we're certainly not hating on Uncharted 2 by any means.

2377
02:39:52,720 --> 02:39:53,720
We're just like you.

2378
02:39:53,720 --> 02:39:55,720
We have to pay $60 of our own money if we want to play the game.

2379
02:39:55,720 --> 02:39:57,720
They don't send us this stuff for free,

2380
02:39:57,720 --> 02:39:58,720
so we'll get to those stuff eventually.

2381
02:39:58,720 --> 02:40:00,720
But seriously, what other show are you going to hear about,

2382
02:40:00,720 --> 02:40:02,720
President Cat, on this week?

2383
02:40:02,720 --> 02:40:04,720
Let's make it happen, guys.

2384
02:40:04,720 --> 02:40:06,720
It's the OL Army, and the way you can help us out,

2385
02:40:06,720 --> 02:40:09,720
always just tell two friends about our show and help spread the word.

2386
02:40:09,720 --> 02:40:11,720
From us to you guys, thank you so much.

2387
02:40:11,720 --> 02:40:12,720
We'll see you next week.

2388
02:40:12,720 --> 02:40:13,720
We'll be back to do this all again,

2389
02:40:13,720 --> 02:40:17,720
and I'm sure plenty of updates on this whole President Cat thing

2390
02:40:17,720 --> 02:40:22,720
and even more of gaming news because it's just a lullsy time

2391
02:40:22,720 --> 02:40:23,720
here at Orange Lounge Radio.

2392
02:40:23,720 --> 02:40:28,720
So on behalf of myself, DarkSakura, Loki, doo-doo-doo-doo guy,

2393
02:40:28,720 --> 02:40:30,720
and President Cat, we'll see you next time.

2394
02:40:30,720 --> 02:40:33,720
