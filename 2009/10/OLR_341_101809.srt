1
00:00:14,031 --> 00:00:15,873
[SPEAKER_07]: Night, October 18, 2009.

2
00:00:16,414 --> 00:00:24,343
[SPEAKER_07]: Playing early bootlegs Gichuban from Xbox, the PSP series gains heavy product placement tie-ins, and the classic arcade racer returns.

3
00:00:31,445 --> 00:00:31,905
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura.com

4
00:00:49,602 --> 00:00:52,584
[SPEAKER_09]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

5
00:01:17,338 --> 00:01:17,658
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, I was.

6
00:01:17,698 --> 00:01:19,620
[SPEAKER_09]: So we got to hear, and you have the full version now.

7
00:01:19,660 --> 00:01:20,060
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, I do.

8
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:21,681
[SPEAKER_09]: So we got to hear some of the mixes.

9
00:01:22,061 --> 00:01:24,443
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm kind of curious what our chat thought of what they got to hear.

10
00:01:24,523 --> 00:01:27,205
[SPEAKER_09]: Sadly, you know, we can't reproduce it for the podcast because of copyright and all that.

11
00:01:27,565 --> 00:01:30,647
[SPEAKER_09]: But we were playing the, what was that?

12
00:01:31,167 --> 00:01:33,089
[SPEAKER_09]: Eric Pryde's Tears for Fears.

13
00:01:33,769 --> 00:01:37,011
[SPEAKER_08]: Eric Pryde's piano versus Tears for Fears shout.

14
00:01:37,191 --> 00:01:43,355
[SPEAKER_08]: And then, of course, MC Hammer with Can't Touch This and Vanilla Ice.

15
00:01:43,415 --> 00:01:47,038
[SPEAKER_08]: Which was sounding really epic in the beginning, but got a little.

16
00:01:47,878 --> 00:01:49,839
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not one of the better tracks in there.

17
00:01:49,879 --> 00:01:51,219
[SPEAKER_08]: But there's a lot of good tracks in there.

18
00:01:51,419 --> 00:01:52,620
[SPEAKER_08]: And we'll get into that later.

19
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:55,541
[SPEAKER_08]: But I'm not disappointed at all.

20
00:01:55,741 --> 00:01:57,041
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, we'll get into that in just a minute.

21
00:01:57,081 --> 00:01:59,082
[SPEAKER_09]: I know Loki wants to talk about that during his gaming week.

22
00:01:59,122 --> 00:02:03,124
[SPEAKER_09]: But first, I need to plug our lovely bandwidth hosts.

23
00:02:03,284 --> 00:02:05,985
[SPEAKER_09]: The one and only www.allgames.com.

24
00:02:06,025 --> 00:02:10,046
[SPEAKER_09]: All Games Radio always helps us out by letting us steal their bandwidth every Sunday night.

25
00:02:10,066 --> 00:02:12,187
[SPEAKER_09]: And they are the home to a bunch of great programs.

26
00:02:12,247 --> 00:02:15,628
[SPEAKER_09]: Not just Bobby, who's usually on before us when he's not in a drum line.

27
00:02:16,088 --> 00:02:16,969
[SPEAKER_09]: All games radio www.allgames.com

28
00:02:34,158 --> 00:02:35,199
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, why not?

29
00:02:35,779 --> 00:02:36,099
[SPEAKER_09]: Sad.

30
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:37,841
[SPEAKER_09]: You should come join us some Sunday.

31
00:02:37,881 --> 00:02:44,666
[SPEAKER_09]: And if you are hearing this on a Sunday night that happens to be October 18th, then we actually are live and you are tuned in to All Games Radio.

32
00:02:44,946 --> 00:02:49,289
[SPEAKER_09]: And you know that we're going to start off the show, as we always do, with a little bit of How Is Your Gaming Week.

33
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:51,451
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, what types of video games have you been playing this week?

34
00:02:53,533 --> 00:02:56,255
[SPEAKER_09]: You do have to speak at some point during this radio show.

35
00:02:56,695 --> 00:02:57,055
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

36
00:02:57,376 --> 00:02:57,756
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm fine.

37
00:02:57,996 --> 00:02:58,717
[SPEAKER_06]: I play Peggle.

38
00:02:59,817 --> 00:03:00,438
[SPEAKER_09]: And how is Peggle?

39
00:03:01,087 --> 00:03:02,028
[SPEAKER_06]: What type of comics?

40
00:03:26,811 --> 00:03:30,333
[SPEAKER_06]: I will pull... Oh, look, my game decides to start working now.

41
00:03:31,313 --> 00:03:32,674
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to build a house live on air.

42
00:03:33,254 --> 00:03:38,056
[SPEAKER_06]: Deadpool 900, including the epic story of Deadpool versus mimes.

43
00:03:38,496 --> 00:03:40,477
[SPEAKER_09]: We have Deadpool versus mimes?

44
00:03:40,777 --> 00:03:41,537
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, look at the cover.

45
00:03:41,777 --> 00:03:42,097
[SPEAKER_06]: Mimes.

46
00:03:43,278 --> 00:03:45,058
[SPEAKER_08]: That's not a very fair fight if you ask me.

47
00:03:45,099 --> 00:03:50,121
[SPEAKER_06]: They're mimes that are powered with psychological weapons that their mimery actually causes real damage.

48
00:03:50,141 --> 00:03:50,861
[SPEAKER_09]: Their mimery?

49
00:03:51,241 --> 00:03:51,841
[SPEAKER_06]: Their mimery.

50
00:03:52,561 --> 00:03:53,022
[SPEAKER_06]: Mimicry.

51
00:03:53,522 --> 00:03:54,022
[SPEAKER_06]: No mimery.

52
00:03:54,142 --> 00:03:54,862
[SPEAKER_06]: I like the word mimery.

53
00:03:55,123 --> 00:03:56,163
[SPEAKER_09]: Knock that miming off.

54
00:03:57,426 --> 00:03:58,581
[SPEAKER_09]: I've had to play with... You know...

55
00:03:59,349 --> 00:04:01,130
[SPEAKER_09]: I've got to play with your audio a little bit, by the way.

56
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:04,773
[SPEAKER_09]: If you are hearing DarkSakura kind of fade in and out, it's live radio.

57
00:04:04,793 --> 00:04:05,733
[SPEAKER_09]: That kind of thing happens.

58
00:04:06,234 --> 00:04:07,675
[SPEAKER_09]: We adjust audio on the fly sometimes.

59
00:04:07,815 --> 00:04:08,615
[SPEAKER_06]: Because remember, though.

60
00:04:09,096 --> 00:04:09,276
[SPEAKER_09]: What?

61
00:04:09,876 --> 00:04:11,377
[SPEAKER_06]: A mime is a wonderful thing to waste.

62
00:04:11,577 --> 00:04:11,877
[SPEAKER_06]: Shut up.

63
00:04:12,458 --> 00:04:12,858
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, wait.

64
00:04:12,898 --> 00:04:14,799
[SPEAKER_09]: I have an idea for a new segment, though, DarkSakura.

65
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:15,280
[SPEAKER_09]: What?

66
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:19,603
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to do a segment called DarkSakura Reviews Games Through Grunting.

67
00:04:20,223 --> 00:04:20,623
[SPEAKER_09]: You ready?

68
00:04:20,943 --> 00:04:21,944
[SPEAKER_05]: What game should I review?

69
00:04:22,244 --> 00:04:25,887
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to name some games and you review them with a grunt.

70
00:04:26,367 --> 00:04:26,607
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

71
00:04:26,667 --> 00:04:27,628
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll start with something easy.

72
00:04:28,048 --> 00:04:28,308
[SPEAKER_09]: Sims 3.

73
00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:47,222
[SPEAKER_09]: Marvel Ultimate Alliance Yaris DJ Hero Speaking of which, I don't know if there's anything else Loki, do you have anything you want DarkSakura to review with a grunt?

74
00:04:47,803 --> 00:04:55,048
[SPEAKER_09]: No I can't think of anything else The Shadow Complex Okay, Shadow Complex Bayonetta

75
00:04:56,448 --> 00:04:57,969
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright.

76
00:04:58,849 --> 00:05:00,389
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey cheater, that's not even out yet.

77
00:05:00,829 --> 00:05:03,770
[SPEAKER_06]: It's pretty though.

78
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:05,170
[SPEAKER_14]: She's wearing her hair.

79
00:05:06,651 --> 00:05:07,891
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki, how was your gaming week?

80
00:05:09,051 --> 00:05:10,252
[SPEAKER_08]: It was good.

81
00:05:10,292 --> 00:05:11,752
[SPEAKER_08]: Played lots of Grand Theft Auto.

82
00:05:12,372 --> 00:05:14,012
[SPEAKER_08]: Lost and Damned.

83
00:05:14,753 --> 00:05:20,974
[SPEAKER_08]: There's been rumors going out there and I've seen it now that people have found a way around the patch so they can re-enable mods again.

84
00:05:21,274 --> 00:05:22,555
[SPEAKER_08]: I've been trying to figure out how to do that.

85
00:05:23,215 --> 00:05:23,835
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm close.

86
00:05:24,943 --> 00:05:31,426
[SPEAKER_08]: But what I thought I needed to change actually freezes the game up, so not quite there yet, but I'm on the path to getting it done.

87
00:05:32,586 --> 00:05:35,188
[SPEAKER_08]: And I've obviously been playing lots of DJ Hero.

88
00:05:36,748 --> 00:05:44,832
[SPEAKER_08]: I played it for a few hours today and yesterday, and most of the game starts off locked when you, you know, most of the tracks that you can play.

89
00:05:45,232 --> 00:05:47,573
[SPEAKER_08]: So I've actually unlocked almost everything in the game so far.

90
00:05:47,773 --> 00:05:49,034
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, that's how much I've been playing it.

91
00:05:49,194 --> 00:05:49,294
[SPEAKER_08]: And

92
00:05:49,926 --> 00:05:50,366
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks for watching!

93
00:06:05,652 --> 00:06:05,892
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura

94
00:06:33,956 --> 00:06:34,256
[SPEAKER_09]: DJ Hero, DJ Hero

95
00:06:58,775 --> 00:06:59,876
[SPEAKER_09]: Dig Dug, Mr. Doom, Pac-Man, CGA, etc.

96
00:07:20,714 --> 00:07:24,656
[SPEAKER_09]: But you don't download games on PlayStation Network to play them in four colors now, do you?

97
00:07:25,097 --> 00:07:29,299
[SPEAKER_09]: Obviously the game's been fleshed out with a whole new high def mode and pretty crisp graphics.

98
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:35,543
[SPEAKER_09]: So if you're into retro gaming, I think you'll kind of like this, especially because it combines the elements of all these old games.

99
00:07:36,663 --> 00:07:39,525
[SPEAKER_09]: I like a lot of the retro games, though.

100
00:07:39,585 --> 00:07:42,307
[SPEAKER_09]: It can get a little repetitive, so be warned.

101
00:07:42,387 --> 00:07:45,789
[SPEAKER_09]: But they do try to throw in some things to make it interesting, like co-op survival and

102
00:07:46,109 --> 00:07:47,610
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

103
00:08:05,367 --> 00:08:06,348
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you for watching!

104
00:08:20,818 --> 00:08:21,879
[SPEAKER_09]: But not bad.

105
00:08:22,219 --> 00:08:24,301
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not depressed with the money I spent.

106
00:08:24,621 --> 00:08:28,183
[SPEAKER_09]: But I don't think it's a wow, OMG, run out and buy it right now type game either.

107
00:08:28,483 --> 00:08:33,587
[SPEAKER_09]: I think if you like the old retro classics, you like your 80s PC games, you'll get a kick out of this.

108
00:08:34,627 --> 00:08:43,854
[SPEAKER_09]: But maybe you'll find out faster than I did that there's actually a fire button and you can actually shoot the oncoming enemies that makes the game a little easier when you feel a little overwhelmed.

109
00:08:44,054 --> 00:08:44,934
[SPEAKER_09]: Because I had no idea.

110
00:08:44,974 --> 00:08:47,636
[SPEAKER_09]: There's no tutorial or nothing to kind of get you going with the game.

111
00:08:47,996 --> 00:08:50,138
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's my one little piece of feedback for it.

112
00:08:50,818 --> 00:08:57,643
[SPEAKER_09]: Otherwise, OMG, World of Warcraft, LOL, WTFBBQ I'm just looking for donations, by the way Are you?

113
00:08:58,263 --> 00:09:19,478
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah Everybody's looking for donations on this show Well, no, I mean, because I can't I know, I know But I am up to level 52 on my paladin I just hit 52 before the show tonight Which isn't bad, considering I think she rolled on September 3rd or 4th So I haven't been playing that long So I'm happy And I don't have triple XP or anything like that So I'm happy So

114
00:09:20,459 --> 00:09:47,246
[SPEAKER_09]: that's it for my gaming week pretty much otherwise the same type of stuff I already talked about last week like Demon's Souls and Katamari Forever and all that fun stuff so now that we've talked about our gaming weeks let's get into some housekeeping real quick but actually not a lot for that segment either so I'm just gonna plug our Twitter at www.twitter.com slash OLR and of course we also have our Facebook community just search for OL Army by the way we're gonna create an actual page on there too I can't remember if I mentioned this last week or not

115
00:09:48,066 --> 00:10:10,854
[SPEAKER_09]: I was going to work on that more this week but I got sidetracked leveling a paladin so I'm hopefully going to get that done actually we had a lot of shows that we were behind on the feed too three shows went up this week on the podcast feed so you can't say it and do anything for a while I got that just about caught up and yeah so look for that on Facebook and we have a MySpace if anyone actually uses that anymore does anyone use MySpace anymore?

116
00:10:11,214 --> 00:10:11,614
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think so

117
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:17,542
[SPEAKER_06]: The last thing I did on MySpace was look at my art history teacher's blog.

118
00:10:17,722 --> 00:10:20,003
[SPEAKER_09]: The last thing I did on MySpace was block spammers.

119
00:10:20,404 --> 00:10:23,585
[SPEAKER_08]: Nellie looked at MySpace the other day and she's like, wow, it looks like Facebook now.

120
00:10:24,365 --> 00:10:27,927
[SPEAKER_09]: They did change some stuff on there to try and make it more Facebook-y, I guess.

121
00:10:28,127 --> 00:10:31,448
[SPEAKER_09]: Facebook did something that makes me happy.

122
00:10:31,568 --> 00:10:31,888
[SPEAKER_06]: What's that?

123
00:10:32,008 --> 00:10:34,730
[SPEAKER_06]: I can now block everything I don't freaking want to see.

124
00:10:35,230 --> 00:10:37,811
[SPEAKER_06]: I can keep from getting this stupid sorority life invites.

125
00:10:38,735 --> 00:10:39,835
[SPEAKER_09]: They've had that for months.

126
00:11:03,530 --> 00:11:05,451
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyhow, let's move on.

127
00:11:05,511 --> 00:11:09,072
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's talk less ranting on social networking and more gaming news.

128
00:11:09,632 --> 00:11:10,452
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll start off tonight.

129
00:11:10,752 --> 00:11:12,793
[SPEAKER_09]: The wonderful Loki is going to start us off tonight.

130
00:11:13,353 --> 00:11:25,277
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, Nintendo has partnered up with Capcom and 53 other video game publishers in Japan to file suit against four resellers of the popular R4 flash cartridge, you know, the one that launches the pirate stuff.

131
00:11:25,977 --> 00:11:28,038
[SPEAKER_08]: Apparently, though...

132
00:11:29,767 --> 00:11:31,829
[SPEAKER_08]: In Tokyo court, it banned the sale of the devices.

133
00:11:31,870 --> 00:11:36,775
[SPEAKER_08]: However, these four retailers are kind of ignoring that.

134
00:11:37,035 --> 00:11:41,440
[SPEAKER_08]: So there's a new lawsuit now that finally stopped these guys from selling it.

135
00:11:44,504 --> 00:11:46,326
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, it's kind of interesting if you think about it, because...

136
00:11:48,690 --> 00:11:50,531
[SPEAKER_08]: They've been making threats about this stuff for a while now.

137
00:11:50,651 --> 00:11:59,937
[SPEAKER_08]: And I kind of find it funny that they're really only targeting the R4 because that is the most widely known backup device, but there's tons of them out there.

138
00:12:00,037 --> 00:12:05,761
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, the R4s, I don't even think it's being used as much nowadays as some of these other ones.

139
00:12:07,222 --> 00:12:07,542
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

140
00:12:08,042 --> 00:12:13,426
[SPEAKER_08]: But I guess it's a start because I know piracy really eats into the DS sales.

141
00:12:14,764 --> 00:12:15,885
[SPEAKER_09]: Especially overseas, right?

142
00:12:15,905 --> 00:12:18,087
[SPEAKER_09]: They have more of a problem with this overseas than they do here, right?

143
00:12:18,287 --> 00:12:18,628
[SPEAKER_09]: Definitely.

144
00:12:20,629 --> 00:12:22,211
[SPEAKER_09]: Are you surprised by this move?

145
00:12:22,291 --> 00:12:25,874
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, I can't think of anything quite like this that I've heard of recently.

146
00:12:26,094 --> 00:12:26,935
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, it makes sense.

147
00:12:26,975 --> 00:12:30,559
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, the court already banned the sales of this stuff.

148
00:12:30,859 --> 00:12:35,303
[SPEAKER_08]: They went ahead and ignored the loss, so of course they're going to have a lawsuit put against them.

149
00:12:36,904 --> 00:12:37,205
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

150
00:12:37,245 --> 00:12:38,706
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not surprising, I guess.

151
00:12:39,387 --> 00:12:39,587
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

152
00:12:40,353 --> 00:12:41,554
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

153
00:12:41,954 --> 00:12:47,317
[SPEAKER_09]: Why... Do you think there's a legitimate purpose for someone having an R4, or is this just straight-up piracy?

154
00:12:47,697 --> 00:12:56,483
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, is there any type of way that they could come into court and say, oh, well, this R4 has a legitimate purpose, or I mean, is it just 100% piracy?

155
00:12:57,363 --> 00:13:07,570
[SPEAKER_08]: It does have a legitimate purpose as far as enabling homebrew, but once again, though, it's kind of reversing... reverse engineering, you know, the DS sort of to make it work, that kind of stuff.

156
00:13:07,590 --> 00:13:08,050
[SPEAKER_08]: So...

157
00:13:10,467 --> 00:13:15,688
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it might allow for homebrew stuff, but any of the homebrew enabling...

158
00:13:17,028 --> 00:13:18,069
[SPEAKER_08]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

159
00:13:43,183 --> 00:13:43,803
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

160
00:14:04,026 --> 00:14:09,450
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe later on some of the games will patch it so that you can't play those ROMs or whatever on your R4 device.

161
00:14:09,570 --> 00:14:14,314
[SPEAKER_08]: But the ones that are already made out there, there's nothing they can do about it because they can't patch it.

162
00:14:14,534 --> 00:14:16,075
[SPEAKER_08]: I got a wild question for you.

163
00:14:16,956 --> 00:14:18,497
[SPEAKER_09]: Isn't homebrew piracy in a way?

164
00:14:19,218 --> 00:14:22,080
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, any homebrew that's cooked up.

165
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:29,425
[SPEAKER_09]: Because aren't you supposed to buy a very expensive kit from Nintendo or Sony or whoever it is to develop for the system?

166
00:14:29,445 --> 00:14:29,805
[SPEAKER_09]: No.

167
00:14:30,546 --> 00:14:32,508
[SPEAKER_09]: We're supposed to buy these very expensive kits to help you do that?

168
00:14:38,337 --> 00:14:44,901
[SPEAKER_08]: And, you know, because of all the stipulations that they have, the testing process has to go through and, you know, development kits and whatnot.

169
00:14:45,641 --> 00:14:49,903
[SPEAKER_08]: Then, yeah, to be in market, you'd have to be like an authorized developer.

170
00:14:50,444 --> 00:14:51,664
[SPEAKER_08]: But this isn't really in market.

171
00:14:51,704 --> 00:14:54,066
[SPEAKER_08]: This is just kind of crap that they're throwing on there.

172
00:14:54,426 --> 00:14:56,887
[SPEAKER_08]: But it encourages people to hack their stuff, right?

173
00:14:57,227 --> 00:15:00,789
[SPEAKER_08]: People are going to hack it no matter what, whether the carts are out there or something else.

174
00:15:00,849 --> 00:15:02,790
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, they'll find a way around it.

175
00:15:03,571 --> 00:15:03,731
[SPEAKER_08]: Hmm.

176
00:15:04,389 --> 00:15:10,671
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, well, I'm going to our chat room at chat.orangelawnsradio.com, and it looks like there's just other devices out there.

177
00:15:11,191 --> 00:15:13,172
[SPEAKER_09]: Azure Edge says, I have Ace Card 2.

178
00:15:13,632 --> 00:15:15,973
[SPEAKER_09]: I've never heard of this, but I guess that's another similar device?

179
00:15:16,353 --> 00:15:17,974
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, there's the Ace Card.

180
00:15:18,014 --> 00:15:21,115
[SPEAKER_08]: There's CycloDS Evolution.

181
00:15:21,215 --> 00:15:27,477
[SPEAKER_08]: They've also got the M3, I think like the D6 or something like that.

182
00:15:29,418 --> 00:15:30,919
[SPEAKER_09]: So why are we just hearing about R4 then?

183
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:34,362
[SPEAKER_08]: Because it's the popular one, I guess.

184
00:15:35,142 --> 00:15:37,424
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just like, you know, like Napster.

185
00:15:37,604 --> 00:15:41,728
[SPEAKER_08]: Remember there was Napster and a lot of other file sharing services, but everyone went after Napster.

186
00:15:41,768 --> 00:15:44,330
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh yeah, LimeWire, Virus Heaven, I remember that one.

187
00:15:45,130 --> 00:15:50,034
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I'm just saying that there were other services out there, but, you know, they're going to go after them.

188
00:15:50,094 --> 00:15:50,935
[SPEAKER_08]: Just like Pirate Bay.

189
00:15:51,175 --> 00:15:57,279
[SPEAKER_08]: They're going after Pirate Bay because that's the most, I guess, they're making an example out of them or something like that.

190
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:57,960
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, but...

191
00:15:59,156 --> 00:16:01,137
[SPEAKER_06]: They really can't do anything about Pirate Bay.

192
00:16:01,997 --> 00:16:04,278
[SPEAKER_06]: Unless they get international law changed.

193
00:16:05,019 --> 00:16:07,040
[SPEAKER_09]: Didn't Pirate Bay have to stop?

194
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:08,100
[SPEAKER_09]: Didn't something happen with that?

195
00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:08,641
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, I don't know.

196
00:16:08,701 --> 00:16:09,681
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't use Pirate Bay.

197
00:16:09,701 --> 00:16:10,922
[SPEAKER_08]: It did, but it's still up.

198
00:16:11,682 --> 00:16:13,103
[SPEAKER_08]: So I don't really know.

199
00:16:13,543 --> 00:16:15,544
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess it didn't work very well.

200
00:16:15,664 --> 00:16:23,347
[SPEAKER_09]: Going to our chat again, Tiger Claw says, Homebrew is also used to create applications that can be useful for non-gaming purposes, like listening to internet radio and such.

201
00:16:24,008 --> 00:16:25,388
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, I guess that would be useful, wouldn't it?

202
00:16:25,769 --> 00:16:26,529
[SPEAKER_09]: For programs like this.

203
00:16:28,341 --> 00:16:50,167
[SPEAKER_08]: well it's also the kind of you know put the applications and features that you want on a certain console it's a way to build those in where you know said company is not putting them in and actually some companies like Sony have learned from the homebrew community and see you know have seen what they put in there and they've added that support in later on

204
00:16:52,085 --> 00:16:56,371
[SPEAKER_09]: Sometimes little things kind of get endorsed too.

205
00:16:56,451 --> 00:17:01,898
[SPEAKER_09]: I seem to remember, you know, speaking of, because Tiger Claw's comment kind of made me think of internet radio on the Wii.

206
00:17:02,058 --> 00:17:09,729
[SPEAKER_09]: There was a program a while back, and I can't remember the name of it, and I don't even know if it's still developed, but it was a program that was supposed to let you get podcasts on your Wii.

207
00:17:10,169 --> 00:17:14,130
[SPEAKER_09]: Like it downloaded them to some program and then you... Sorry, not the Wii, the Xbox 360.

208
00:17:14,490 --> 00:17:15,571
[SPEAKER_09]: You can get podcasts on the 360.

209
00:17:16,271 --> 00:17:22,533
[SPEAKER_09]: And I remember it was really controversial because all the podcasts that were in it by default, it was downloading like the last five episodes all at once.

210
00:17:22,573 --> 00:17:23,993
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe somebody in chat can remember the name of this.

211
00:17:24,674 --> 00:17:24,794
[SPEAKER_09]: And...

212
00:17:26,094 --> 00:17:29,417
[SPEAKER_09]: I remember we were listed in a future version of it after that bug was taken out.

213
00:17:30,017 --> 00:17:35,122
[SPEAKER_09]: The reason why I bring it up is that I seem to remember Major Nelson mentioned it on his blog or something.

214
00:17:35,142 --> 00:17:41,006
[SPEAKER_09]: That's why the thing got so popular so fast and it just screwed the bandwidth of all these sites.

215
00:17:41,026 --> 00:17:43,508
[SPEAKER_09]: I remember Gamer Andy was pissed about it.

216
00:17:43,969 --> 00:17:48,012
[SPEAKER_09]: TigerClaw says it's TVercity, but that's actually not the one I'm thinking of.

217
00:17:48,072 --> 00:17:52,536
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that lets you do podcasts also, but that's not the same one I'm thinking of.

218
00:17:52,616 --> 00:17:53,897
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what you use for streaming video.

219
00:17:55,038 --> 00:17:55,238
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

220
00:17:56,414 --> 00:17:56,774
[SPEAKER_09]: POKEMON POKEMON

221
00:18:23,502 --> 00:18:27,183
[SPEAKER_09]: Nintendo officially unveiled the game this week, meaning screenshots and all that fun stuff.

222
00:18:27,524 --> 00:18:29,524
[SPEAKER_09]: It is coming out in Japan on December 5th.

223
00:18:29,564 --> 00:18:31,245
[SPEAKER_09]: It'll set you back 4,800 yen.

224
00:18:31,565 --> 00:18:34,626
[SPEAKER_09]: That would be $53 in exchange rates.

225
00:18:36,147 --> 00:18:44,150
[SPEAKER_09]: Sadly, though, it's not really a Pokemon Game Boy game on the Wii like people have been wanting, oh, I don't know, forever.

226
00:18:45,170 --> 00:19:06,466
[SPEAKER_09]: instead, it's a game where you are of course Pikachu because what other Pokemon is nearly as famous and you're in like a theme park and you tag, battle, and participate in quiz minigames oh joy, it's another minigame collection on the Nintendo Wii only this time, it has Pokemon but my Pokemans, let me show you them

227
00:19:07,428 --> 00:19:10,049
[SPEAKER_09]: Also, Pikachu interacts with new friends.

228
00:19:10,370 --> 00:19:14,171
[SPEAKER_09]: There's also a camera mode to let you photograph the Pokemon you meet.

229
00:19:14,552 --> 00:19:17,433
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess kind of tipping the hat to Pokemon Snap, which was kind of awesome.

230
00:19:18,273 --> 00:19:19,574
[SPEAKER_09]: But no words about Mudkips.

231
00:19:19,894 --> 00:19:20,414
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry, guys.

232
00:19:21,615 --> 00:19:23,336
[SPEAKER_03]: But Pokemans, Rob.

233
00:19:23,656 --> 00:19:27,778
[SPEAKER_09]: I know it's Pokemans, but it's not like the Game Boy Pokemon games.

234
00:19:28,038 --> 00:19:29,159
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't care, Pokemans.

235
00:19:29,199 --> 00:19:29,759
[SPEAKER_06]: It'll sell.

236
00:19:30,079 --> 00:19:31,420
[SPEAKER_06]: Nintendo prints money.

237
00:19:32,099 --> 00:19:36,021
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess so, but I'm just like, yay, another minigame collection on the Wii.

238
00:19:36,341 --> 00:19:39,942
[SPEAKER_09]: Although, to be fair, they're talking about tagging and battling and all this other stuff, too.

239
00:19:40,483 --> 00:19:46,285
[SPEAKER_09]: And I shouldn't judge a game before I play it, but you're not giving me a lot to go off of here.

240
00:19:46,325 --> 00:19:52,968
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not like the Wii has demos, either, and I'm not going to spend $40 or $50 on a game just to find out it's another crappy minigame collection.

241
00:19:53,488 --> 00:19:55,809
[SPEAKER_14]: But, but, but, Rob, Pokemons...

242
00:19:56,513 --> 00:19:59,054
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkTattooia in chat says Pokemon Snap needs a sequel.

243
00:19:59,594 --> 00:20:04,936
[SPEAKER_09]: It sort of does, and maybe that's what they're trying to allude to with this, but I wouldn't say that this is a sequel by any means.

244
00:20:05,277 --> 00:20:12,900
[SPEAKER_09]: Now I'm looking at screenshots, and here's one where it looks like Pikachu's kind of fighting Charizard with some timer on the screen doing battles, so I don't know, maybe...

245
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:22,383
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe there's something cool in there, but it's not the role-playing Pokemon a lot of you guys have come to know and love, which I think is the game people really want on the Wii.

246
00:20:24,063 --> 00:20:26,784
[SPEAKER_06]: That's sad and a shame and a travesty.

247
00:20:27,284 --> 00:20:27,484
[SPEAKER_06]: It is.

248
00:20:27,684 --> 00:20:30,165
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what else is sad and a shame and a travesty?

249
00:20:30,345 --> 00:20:30,545
[SPEAKER_06]: What?

250
00:20:31,165 --> 00:20:32,265
[SPEAKER_06]: What Sega's doing.

251
00:20:32,406 --> 00:20:33,026
[SPEAKER_06]: What is Sega doing?

252
00:20:33,046 --> 00:20:37,367
[SPEAKER_06]: Bringing back a piece of my tortured past into full HD life.

253
00:20:39,007 --> 00:20:39,848
[SPEAKER_09]: I do not understand.

254
00:20:39,908 --> 00:20:40,588
[SPEAKER_09]: Please elaborate.

255
00:20:41,905 --> 00:20:45,488
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if I've ever told you about my nightmares of Daytona USA.

256
00:20:46,429 --> 00:20:48,770
[SPEAKER_09]: Even if you have, it's probably been years, so tell them again.

257
00:20:49,891 --> 00:20:56,516
[SPEAKER_06]: When I worked for my Namco Arcade, we had a four-person Daytona USA, and it would follow me.

258
00:20:56,716 --> 00:20:59,698
[SPEAKER_06]: I would hear, Daytona!

259
00:21:00,659 --> 00:21:03,641
[SPEAKER_06]: Or, Rolling Star!

260
00:21:04,721 --> 00:21:06,263
[SPEAKER_08]: What about Daytona?

261
00:21:06,303 --> 00:21:08,404
[SPEAKER_06]: That too.

262
00:21:08,884 --> 00:21:09,865
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's coming back.

263
00:21:10,085 --> 00:21:10,926
[SPEAKER_06]: It is coming back.

264
00:21:12,034 --> 00:21:15,336
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, is it ever, as Sega Racing Classic.

265
00:21:15,757 --> 00:21:17,137
[SPEAKER_06]: Sega Racing!

266
00:21:19,259 --> 00:21:23,802
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's going to be on the Ringwide arcade hardware.

267
00:21:24,502 --> 00:21:32,007
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's being called Sega Racing Classic because they don't have the rights to the Daytona name anymore.

268
00:21:33,408 --> 00:21:34,589
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, well that makes sense, I guess.

269
00:21:34,609 --> 00:21:37,211
[SPEAKER_06]: So I guess we're not going to get the Daytona...

270
00:21:38,678 --> 00:21:41,020
[SPEAKER_06]: So, but you know what I want?

271
00:21:41,161 --> 00:21:47,146
[SPEAKER_06]: Is I want cameos by Pepsi Man and by Sega Tassanchiro.

272
00:21:49,208 --> 00:21:50,029
[SPEAKER_06]: That would make me happy.

273
00:21:50,590 --> 00:21:54,193
[SPEAKER_09]: Sega always has the most interesting product placement in their games.

274
00:21:54,213 --> 00:21:56,015
[SPEAKER_09]: Because I think about Crazy Taxi.

275
00:21:56,075 --> 00:21:57,656
[SPEAKER_09]: I also want to race as the horse in the game.

276
00:21:58,297 --> 00:22:03,142
[SPEAKER_06]: And I want a little mini game in there where you can make the cars fight each other like Fighters Megamix.

277
00:22:05,098 --> 00:22:07,939
[SPEAKER_09]: X-Link in chat says, I work at an arcade and I hated that song.

278
00:22:08,259 --> 00:22:08,939
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, see?

279
00:22:09,139 --> 00:22:15,342
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyone who has worked in an arcade where the attract mode is turned sufficiently loud enough knows my pain.

280
00:22:16,802 --> 00:22:17,702
[SPEAKER_06]: Knows my pain.

281
00:22:18,363 --> 00:22:19,023
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd have nightmares.

282
00:22:19,263 --> 00:22:19,903
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not kidding.

283
00:22:20,003 --> 00:22:20,663
[SPEAKER_06]: I would have nightmares.

284
00:22:21,163 --> 00:22:21,524
[SPEAKER_06]: Nightmares.

285
00:22:21,944 --> 00:22:22,164
[SPEAKER_09]: Nice.

286
00:22:23,224 --> 00:22:23,924
[SPEAKER_06]: No, it's not.

287
00:22:24,445 --> 00:22:24,985
[SPEAKER_06]: It's awful.

288
00:22:26,277 --> 00:22:37,503
[SPEAKER_06]: How would you like to be in the middle of dreaming about, you know, so-and-so gorgeous person and then hear, oh god, knock it off.

289
00:22:37,563 --> 00:22:40,685
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe I don't understand because I've never played this Daytona game.

290
00:22:40,865 --> 00:22:42,126
[SPEAKER_09]: I just somehow missed it, I guess.

291
00:22:42,466 --> 00:22:53,952
[SPEAKER_06]: I played Daytona USA at the Luxor the first time I went to Las Vegas when the game first came out and had the eight-person big rally set up.

292
00:22:55,618 --> 00:22:56,599
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought it was cool then.

293
00:22:56,639 --> 00:22:58,320
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the last time I ever thought that game was cool.

294
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:00,501
[SPEAKER_09]: Wait, don't they have this at Dave & Buster's?

295
00:23:01,521 --> 00:23:02,582
[SPEAKER_06]: They have something similar.

296
00:23:02,602 --> 00:23:03,563
[SPEAKER_08]: I think they have NASCAR.

297
00:23:05,404 --> 00:23:08,826
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe I played it years ago when they had it at Dave & Buster's, I think.

298
00:23:09,726 --> 00:23:12,568
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, it was one of those games that they would have linked like 80,000 units.

299
00:23:12,628 --> 00:23:17,431
[SPEAKER_06]: Rob, you just need to go on YouTube and look up Daytona Rolling Start.

300
00:23:17,851 --> 00:23:19,052
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure, I'd be happy to.

301
00:23:19,752 --> 00:23:20,833
[SPEAKER_06]: It's fantastic radio.

302
00:23:21,333 --> 00:23:22,854
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is how everyone would know.

303
00:23:22,874 --> 00:23:24,795
[SPEAKER_08]: There you go, Tiger Claw linked the theme in the chat room.

304
00:23:25,478 --> 00:23:25,779
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

305
00:23:30,266 --> 00:23:32,890
[SPEAKER_09]: Dude, Tigerclaw's like faster at researching stuff than I am.

306
00:23:33,911 --> 00:23:34,773
[SPEAKER_04]: Might have already been on it.

307
00:23:35,814 --> 00:23:37,537
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm saying that because there's like a 45 second delay.

308
00:23:46,417 --> 00:23:48,038
[SPEAKER_09]: I have played this game.

309
00:23:48,098 --> 00:23:48,939
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, you have.

310
00:23:49,079 --> 00:23:50,060
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, I have.

311
00:23:51,181 --> 00:23:55,384
[SPEAKER_09]: Now that I'm not hearing your horrible karaoke rendition of it, I recognize it.

312
00:23:55,624 --> 00:23:59,707
[SPEAKER_06]: You need to find the Rolling Start one, because that's the one that I still hear in my sleep.

313
00:24:01,288 --> 00:24:02,809
[SPEAKER_08]: How could you not like this song?

314
00:24:03,209 --> 00:24:05,091
[SPEAKER_08]: It's totally not repetitive.

315
00:24:05,111 --> 00:24:06,812
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I have something called taste.

316
00:24:08,053 --> 00:24:11,295
[SPEAKER_08]: This almost sounds like it could be like an 80s cartoon theme, you know?

317
00:24:11,335 --> 00:24:11,916
[SPEAKER_08]: That'd be awesome.

318
00:24:14,978 --> 00:24:15,238
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura

319
00:24:44,522 --> 00:24:45,062
[SPEAKER_09]: Knock knock.

320
00:24:46,223 --> 00:24:46,583
[SPEAKER_06]: What?

321
00:24:53,588 --> 00:24:57,390
[SPEAKER_01]: What?

322
00:24:57,430 --> 00:24:57,791
[SPEAKER_01]: Shut up.

323
00:24:59,252 --> 00:25:00,092
[SPEAKER_01]: I will play it again.

324
00:25:00,392 --> 00:25:01,393
[SPEAKER_09]: I will fucking play it again.

325
00:25:01,413 --> 00:25:02,434
[SPEAKER_04]: I will kick you in the face.

326
00:25:04,975 --> 00:25:06,496
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, your ringtone is on my phone, by the way.

327
00:25:06,696 --> 00:25:06,916
[SPEAKER_09]: What?

328
00:25:09,578 --> 00:25:10,098
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to guess.

329
00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:10,799
[SPEAKER_08]: Is it?

330
00:25:14,486 --> 00:25:15,186
[SPEAKER_12]: No, no, no.

331
00:25:15,226 --> 00:25:20,569
[SPEAKER_08]: Let me borrow that toss.

332
00:25:20,589 --> 00:25:21,930
[SPEAKER_06]: Just let me borrow that toss.

333
00:25:22,290 --> 00:25:23,571
[SPEAKER_06]: So I gave you something more annoying.

334
00:25:23,671 --> 00:25:23,951
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

335
00:25:24,631 --> 00:25:26,152
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know what it is with this show tonight.

336
00:25:26,192 --> 00:25:29,133
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just, I'm... It's called Jamie Has a Headache.

337
00:25:29,153 --> 00:25:29,714
[SPEAKER_06]: I feel sorry.

338
00:25:30,034 --> 00:25:32,655
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, and Tiger Claw linked the Rolling Start, by the way.

339
00:25:32,895 --> 00:25:33,315
[SPEAKER_09]: Awesome.

340
00:25:34,836 --> 00:25:36,917
[SPEAKER_06]: That one, actually, I do like that one, okay?

341
00:25:37,417 --> 00:25:38,698
[SPEAKER_06]: Just because I think it's kind of neat.

342
00:25:38,778 --> 00:25:40,399
[SPEAKER_09]: I realize this game is like years and years old.

343
00:25:40,419 --> 00:25:40,759
[SPEAKER_09]: Rolling Start!

344
00:25:45,325 --> 00:25:48,391
[SPEAKER_08]: I love this soundtrack, what are you talking about?

345
00:25:48,491 --> 00:25:51,076
[SPEAKER_08]: It's more of a song you need to play the game to.

346
00:26:03,328 --> 00:26:06,930
[SPEAKER_09]: XLink in chat says, I'll fly over there and both of them in the face.

347
00:26:07,050 --> 00:26:09,571
[SPEAKER_09]: Except he left out, like, there's a word missing there, I think.

348
00:26:10,231 --> 00:26:13,373
[SPEAKER_09]: So, you know what you can do in the face?

349
00:26:16,634 --> 00:26:18,035
[SPEAKER_06]: Rob, you need to cleanse the palate.

350
00:26:19,755 --> 00:26:20,596
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, let's move on.

351
00:26:20,616 --> 00:26:21,436
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki, save us.

352
00:26:22,137 --> 00:26:22,377
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

353
00:26:23,117 --> 00:26:24,558
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's get into some release dates.

354
00:26:24,618 --> 00:26:27,459
[SPEAKER_09]: Perhaps that will end the Daytona chat.

355
00:26:27,930 --> 00:26:29,832
[SPEAKER_08]: Never, it will never end that chat.

356
00:26:30,232 --> 00:26:33,714
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, um, so coming out this week is actually a pretty good lineup of stuff.

357
00:26:34,255 --> 00:26:41,240
[SPEAKER_08]: Starting off, we've got Borderlands, which is making its way out to PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.

358
00:26:44,763 --> 00:26:45,683
[SPEAKER_08]: Did Rob mess up?

359
00:26:47,004 --> 00:26:47,785
[SPEAKER_09]: No, just go ahead.

360
00:26:48,145 --> 00:26:51,047
[SPEAKER_09]: I totally, like, skipped, like, three stories in the show, but that's okay.

361
00:26:51,067 --> 00:26:52,548
[SPEAKER_09]: Just do release dates now, we'll go back to it.

362
00:26:52,989 --> 00:26:53,309
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright.

363
00:26:53,689 --> 00:26:54,350
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyways, um...

364
00:26:55,819 --> 00:26:59,442
[SPEAKER_09]: I got too distracted by Daytona.

365
00:26:59,523 --> 00:27:00,023
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sorry.

366
00:27:01,905 --> 00:27:03,266
[SPEAKER_08]: But it's good music to think to.

367
00:27:05,225 --> 00:27:13,290
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, so yeah, as I said, Borderlands coming out this week, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, pretty awesome looking, so definitely check that out.

368
00:27:14,111 --> 00:27:25,078

00:27:41,980 --> 00:27:46,383

[SPEAKER_08]: Jillian Michaels Fitness Ultimatum 2010 on DS.

389
00:29:11,415 --> 00:29:12,515
[SPEAKER_08]: What a bunch of crap.

390
00:29:13,276 --> 00:29:14,376
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, exactly.

391
00:29:14,396 --> 00:29:15,476
[SPEAKER_02]: A bunch of horse crap.

392
00:29:15,756 --> 00:29:17,236
[SPEAKER_02]: Ha, because of the farm ones.

393
00:29:18,376 --> 00:29:20,297
[SPEAKER_08]: Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do.

[SPEAKER_09]: Well, is your mic on?

399
00:30:27,861 --> 00:30:30,903
[SPEAKER_09]: I didn't... No, I turned it off because you said I was typing too loud.

400
00:30:30,963 --> 00:30:31,323
[SPEAKER_09]: That's right.

401
00:30:31,683 --> 00:30:35,084
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, so you had these grapes that were the size of eyeballs.

402
00:30:35,124 --> 00:30:38,826
[SPEAKER_09]: And it made me think how like... You remember like when you'd go to those haunted houses like when you were younger?

403
00:30:39,186 --> 00:30:43,308
[SPEAKER_09]: They'd put like frozen grapes like in a bowl and tell you it was a bowl full of eyeballs?

404
00:30:43,548 --> 00:30:43,848
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

405

00:31:16,983 --> 00:31:21,129
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkTetsuya in chat says, Cooking Mama, Rolling Stones.

00:32:55,935 --> 00:32:56,415
[SPEAKER_08]: So wrong.

437
00:32:56,835 --> 00:32:57,936
[SPEAKER_08]: The joke's right itself.

438
00:32:57,996 --> 00:32:58,896
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't have to say anything.

439
00:32:59,176 --> 00:33:01,837
[SPEAKER_08]: Medieval Games on the Wii for all your Ren Faire fans.

440
00:33:02,137 --> 00:33:05,779
[SPEAKER_08]: Grand Theft Auto Chinatown Wars coming to the PSP this week, which looks pretty cool.

441
00:33:07,039 --> 00:33:09,220
[SPEAKER_08]: Dragon Ball Revenge of King Piccolo on the Wii.

442
00:33:10,862 --> 00:33:13,484
[SPEAKER_08]: Star Wars The Force Unleashed Ultimate Sith Edition on PC World of the Zoo

443
00:33:33,479 --> 00:33:43,787
[SPEAKER_09]: Finally, um, let's see, I wanted to actually read something from chat here that was, um, from Sycoon saying, Orange Lounge is one big tangent today.

444
00:33:44,187 --> 00:33:53,835
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, it is, and I'm gonna start another one here, because speaking of release dates, going to last week's releases, we had a huge game come out this week that nobody mentioned during their gaming weeks, Uncharted 2.

445
00:33:55,076 --> 00:34:01,621
[SPEAKER_09]: I, anywhere I look, I can't stop hearing about this game and how fucking amazing it's supposed to be, like, you

446
00:34:03,522 --> 00:34:12,069
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't usually play a lot of the platformy Tomb Raider type of games, which I hear Uncharted 2 kind of is, so I haven't really been paying attention.

447
00:34:12,489 --> 00:34:21,656
[SPEAKER_09]: But now, as I will hear about how awesome this game is non-stop and how people are already calling it Game of the Year, I kind of feel like I need to play it.

448
00:34:22,036 --> 00:34:26,359
[SPEAKER_09]: So I've got to turn to Loki, who's talked about this game a little more on the show than I have.

449
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:28,241
[SPEAKER_09]: What have you heard about this game?

450
00:34:28,261 --> 00:34:32,083
[SPEAKER_09]: You didn't mention it either, but I seriously have not heard a single thing bad about it.

451
00:34:32,324 --> 00:34:32,804
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, not one.

452
00:34:34,898 --> 00:34:36,540
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

453
00:34:36,780 --> 00:34:37,901
[SPEAKER_08]: It got good reviews.

454
00:34:38,942 --> 00:34:39,563
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not buying it.

455
00:34:40,144 --> 00:34:40,464
[SPEAKER_08]: Why not?

456
00:34:40,484 --> 00:34:42,066
[SPEAKER_09]: Because I don't want to buy it.

457
00:34:43,507 --> 00:34:46,830
[SPEAKER_09]: Is it one of those things where it's like, oh, well, you're too cool for school.

458
00:34:46,910 --> 00:34:47,551
[SPEAKER_09]: No, no, no.

459
00:34:47,611 --> 00:34:48,312
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not even that.

460
00:34:48,432 --> 00:34:49,673
[SPEAKER_08]: It's an action game.

461
00:34:50,174 --> 00:34:51,695
[SPEAKER_08]: Not even so much like Tomb Raider.

462
00:34:51,715 --> 00:34:55,940
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, that was kind of the comparisons of the first game were kind of like, oh, it's Tomb Raider with a guy.

463
00:34:57,233 --> 00:34:57,813
[SPEAKER_08]: Not so much now.

464
00:34:57,833 --> 00:34:58,953
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, it's more of just an action game.

465
00:34:58,973 --> 00:35:00,474
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a very cinematic action game.

466
00:35:01,234 --> 00:35:02,314
[SPEAKER_08]: I just don't have time for it.

467
00:35:02,855 --> 00:35:04,435
[SPEAKER_08]: And yeah, I can see why they're calling it Game of the Year.

468
00:35:04,815 --> 00:35:07,516
[SPEAKER_08]: It's practically the only game coming from Sony this fall.

469
00:35:07,876 --> 00:35:09,937
[SPEAKER_08]: So it is the Game of the Year.

470
00:35:10,037 --> 00:35:15,118
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, they did have games in the spring, but you know, for argument's sake, we're going to ignore those.

471
00:35:15,758 --> 00:35:18,379
[SPEAKER_08]: But I don't know.

472
00:35:18,499 --> 00:35:18,799
[SPEAKER_08]: It's good.

473
00:35:19,232 --> 00:35:19,972
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, don't get me wrong.

474
00:35:20,113 --> 00:35:20,533
[SPEAKER_09]: Game of the year?

475
00:35:20,633 --> 00:35:21,974
[SPEAKER_09]: Probably not.

476
00:35:22,034 --> 00:35:23,495
[SPEAKER_09]: Kind of some polarizing stuff in chat.

477
00:35:23,515 --> 00:35:26,156
[SPEAKER_09]: Sycoon says, if I got a free copy, I would totally play it.

478
00:35:26,476 --> 00:35:27,077
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a good point.

479
00:35:27,157 --> 00:35:28,097
[SPEAKER_09]: Games are 60 bucks.

480
00:35:28,458 --> 00:35:30,699
[SPEAKER_09]: But again, I haven't heard a negative thing about this game.

481
00:35:30,719 --> 00:35:31,479
[SPEAKER_09]: It's probably worth it.

482
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:34,741
[SPEAKER_09]: And HungryMrCrunk says, why aren't you going to buy it?

483
00:35:34,982 --> 00:35:35,242
[SPEAKER_09]: What?

484
00:35:36,282 --> 00:35:36,863
[SPEAKER_09]: Seriously?

485
00:35:37,983 --> 00:35:38,244
[SPEAKER_09]: What?

486
00:35:39,484 --> 00:35:40,025
[SPEAKER_09]: Daytona?

487
00:35:41,806 --> 00:35:45,128
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, there are a lot of people that probably think you're crazy for what you just said.

488
00:35:45,568 --> 00:35:46,949
[SPEAKER_09]: I at least want to rent it.

489
00:35:48,194 --> 00:35:51,235
[SPEAKER_09]: and see if I like it and get us into it as everyone else does.

490
00:35:51,395 --> 00:35:53,696
[SPEAKER_09]: So I apologize I didn't play it for this week.

491
00:35:53,976 --> 00:35:55,657
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not buying Modern Warfare 2 either.

492
00:35:56,017 --> 00:35:56,817
[SPEAKER_09]: Ooh, I'm crazy.

493
00:35:59,378 --> 00:36:02,239
[SPEAKER_09]: And GameGuru says game of the year for Sony fanboy maybes.

494
00:36:02,339 --> 00:36:03,300
[SPEAKER_09]: Ooh, yikes.

495
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:04,980
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't get me wrong.

496
00:36:05,481 --> 00:36:12,203
[SPEAKER_08]: It is probably going to be the best PlayStation 3 game other than Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 that comes out this year.

497
00:36:14,084 --> 00:36:14,584
[SPEAKER_08]: But that's about it.

498
00:36:15,616 --> 00:36:16,826
[SPEAKER_09]: Best Sony made game this year?

499
00:36:17,472 --> 00:36:17,694
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

500
00:36:18,676 --> 00:36:19,777
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll probably play it at some point.

501
00:36:20,497 --> 00:36:21,858
[SPEAKER_09]: I can never resist peer pressure.

502
00:36:22,179 --> 00:36:23,300
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, anyway, back to release dates.

503
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:23,540
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry.

504
00:36:24,460 --> 00:36:26,602
[SPEAKER_09]: Going to Japan and looking at the Japanese release dates.

505
00:36:27,463 --> 00:36:33,327
[SPEAKER_09]: FIFA Soccer 10 World Class Soccer comes out in Japan as well as Forza Motorsport 3 gets its run in Japan.

506
00:36:33,627 --> 00:36:36,209
[SPEAKER_09]: Those both coming out on the 22nd of October.

507
00:36:36,829 --> 00:36:39,191
[SPEAKER_09]: Moving on over to, of course, the PlayStation 3.

508
00:36:40,232 --> 00:36:42,193
[SPEAKER_09]: FIFA Soccer 10 also comes out over there.

509
00:36:42,674 --> 00:36:45,015
[SPEAKER_09]: That's really the only major release in Japan this week on the PS3.

510
00:36:46,631 --> 00:36:51,375
[SPEAKER_09]: And moving on over to the Nintendo Wii, another port of FIFA 10 World Class Soccer.

511
00:36:51,655 --> 00:36:57,699
[SPEAKER_09]: But there's some other games there as well, including Tsukiban Satchu Rena Wii comes out on the Wii.

512
00:36:58,239 --> 00:37:05,645
[SPEAKER_09]: And I like this because the box art is like this hot pink box art, and it's just kittens all over it.

513
00:37:05,725 --> 00:37:07,886
[SPEAKER_09]: And it looks like it's like a LOLCAT game.

514
00:37:07,946 --> 00:37:08,947
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, I'm not even kidding.

515
00:37:09,347 --> 00:37:10,428
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, my God.

516
00:37:10,688 --> 00:37:11,409
[SPEAKER_09]: I shit you not.

517
00:37:11,429 --> 00:37:11,729
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not.

518
00:37:11,749 --> 00:37:12,529
[SPEAKER_14]: It's Keyboard Cat.

519
00:37:12,549 --> 00:37:14,850
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a scene with a cat playing the piano.

520
00:37:15,330 --> 00:37:17,610
[SPEAKER_09]: It's Keyboard Cat and Lol Cat, like in a game.

521
00:37:17,851 --> 00:37:19,571
[SPEAKER_08]: That is Game of the Year right there.

522
00:37:19,831 --> 00:37:20,331
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sorry.

523
00:37:20,411 --> 00:37:21,271
[SPEAKER_08]: Fuck Uncharted.

524
00:37:21,531 --> 00:37:21,952
[SPEAKER_09]: Fuck it.

525
00:37:22,452 --> 00:37:24,172
[SPEAKER_08]: This is the Game of the Year right here.

526
00:37:25,752 --> 00:37:27,853
[SPEAKER_08]: Why don't they release this crap over here?

527
00:37:27,893 --> 00:37:28,433
[SPEAKER_08]: D3, come on.

528
00:37:29,633 --> 00:37:32,234
[SPEAKER_06]: Dear Working Designs, come back and bring us out.

529
00:37:32,314 --> 00:37:35,795
[SPEAKER_08]: If there is a game that you need to localize for the US, it is this game.

530
00:37:37,042 --> 00:37:38,543
[SPEAKER_09]: They're dancing with kittens.

531
00:37:39,243 --> 00:37:41,725
[SPEAKER_09]: And, oh my god, is that cat shooting a laser?

532
00:37:42,726 --> 00:37:43,046
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh my god.

533
00:37:43,066 --> 00:37:44,327
[SPEAKER_09]: We have laser cats.

534
00:37:45,087 --> 00:37:46,108
[SPEAKER_09]: This is it, right here.

535
00:37:46,648 --> 00:37:48,389
[SPEAKER_09]: Again, I'm going to say this name again.

536
00:37:48,409 --> 00:37:49,290
[SPEAKER_06]: Rob, email me that link.

537
00:37:50,610 --> 00:37:51,531
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to order that game.

538
00:37:52,872 --> 00:37:56,434
[SPEAKER_09]: It is Sukiban Shachu Rena Wee.

539
00:37:56,514 --> 00:37:57,555
[SPEAKER_08]: Question for you, Rob.

540
00:37:58,195 --> 00:37:59,516
[SPEAKER_08]: And this sort of ties in with that.

541
00:38:00,276 --> 00:38:01,677
[SPEAKER_08]: Why don't we move back to the old studio again?

542
00:38:02,698 --> 00:38:03,098
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

543
00:38:03,839 --> 00:38:04,459
[SPEAKER_08]: Because we should.

544
00:38:05,253 --> 00:38:05,533
[SPEAKER_08]: Why?

545
00:38:06,114 --> 00:38:08,597
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I'll get that game and then we can do it on Justin TV.

546
00:38:08,797 --> 00:38:09,418
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, I see.

547
00:38:09,478 --> 00:38:10,179
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe at some point.

548
00:38:11,019 --> 00:38:12,221
[SPEAKER_06]: I can get that set up here.

549
00:38:12,401 --> 00:38:13,122
[SPEAKER_06]: We just need the camera.

550
00:38:13,976 --> 00:38:14,636
[SPEAKER_09]: I can get the camera.

551
00:38:14,656 --> 00:38:15,036
[SPEAKER_09]: That's easy.

552
00:38:15,577 --> 00:38:16,377
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, we can do it in the vault.

553
00:38:16,417 --> 00:38:17,017
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll figure it out.

554
00:38:17,577 --> 00:38:22,119
[SPEAKER_09]: But anyhow, the chat was demanding to check out that game in the chat room.

555
00:38:22,139 --> 00:38:23,239
[SPEAKER_09]: So I posted a link in chat.

556
00:38:23,299 --> 00:38:26,160
[SPEAKER_09]: I apologize to those on the podcast because I can't link it to you.

557
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:29,121
[SPEAKER_09]: But again, that's S-U-K-E-B-A-N.

558
00:38:29,201 --> 00:38:29,741
[SPEAKER_09]: Sukiban.

559
00:38:30,281 --> 00:38:31,822
[SPEAKER_09]: S-H-A-C-H-O-U.

560
00:38:32,002 --> 00:38:32,562
[SPEAKER_09]: Shachu.

561
00:38:33,142 --> 00:38:33,442
[SPEAKER_09]: Rena.

562
00:38:33,602 --> 00:38:34,282
[SPEAKER_09]: R-E-N-A.

563
00:38:34,703 --> 00:38:34,943
[SPEAKER_09]: We.

564
00:38:35,283 --> 00:38:36,703
[SPEAKER_09]: That's the name of the game.

565
00:38:36,803 --> 00:38:39,464
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's cats, cats, and more cats.

566
00:38:39,524 --> 00:38:40,444
[SPEAKER_09]: It's an action game.

567
00:38:41,105 --> 00:38:41,325
[SPEAKER_09]: So...

568
00:38:42,525 --> 00:38:47,229
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, seriously, how can you say Uncharted 2 is the game of the year when you have this game coming out on the Wii?

569
00:38:49,051 --> 00:38:56,617
[SPEAKER_09]: I just don't... I think it's clearly... That was a statement said without considering the rest of the year.

570
00:38:57,778 --> 00:39:02,602
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I'm actually looking up reviews on it to make sure it's Lolcats the game.

571
00:39:05,104 --> 00:39:06,025
[SPEAKER_09]: Let us know what you find.

572
00:39:06,826 --> 00:39:08,307
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, well, I still have to do...

573
00:39:09,721 --> 00:39:10,361
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, hold on, hold on.

574
00:39:11,001 --> 00:39:11,921
[SPEAKER_09]: I got some more releases here.

575
00:39:12,242 --> 00:39:18,003
[SPEAKER_09]: PlayStation 2, Beatmania 2DX 16 Empress is making its way out right now.

576
00:39:18,483 --> 00:39:21,023
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it was out a little early for some people.

577
00:39:21,183 --> 00:39:25,704
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it just came out in Japan this past week, but some of your import stores will finally have it in stock this week.

578
00:39:25,804 --> 00:39:33,186
[SPEAKER_09]: They know that this is one of the big games people like to import, and it's a huge release, obviously being the last 2DX game on PlayStation 2, so look for that.

579
00:39:34,026 --> 00:39:40,893
[SPEAKER_09]: On the Nintendo DS, Element Hunters comes out in Japan this week, as well as Rune Factory 3, and a game called Roller Angels.

580
00:39:41,633 --> 00:39:42,094
[SPEAKER_09]: Check that out.

581
00:39:42,874 --> 00:39:49,861
[SPEAKER_09]: And then lastly, on the Sony PSP, again, these are Japanese release dates, another release of FIFA Soccer 10.

582
00:39:50,481 --> 00:39:53,524
[SPEAKER_09]: Obviously, soccer is very big in countries that aren't the US.

583
00:39:54,125 --> 00:39:54,945
[SPEAKER_09]: And a game called...

584
00:39:55,706 --> 00:40:03,752
[SPEAKER_09]: Haru Kanaru, Toki no Naka, Day 3, Unmei no Meikyu, Aizu Ban, or Treasure Box.

585
00:40:03,872 --> 00:40:08,155
[SPEAKER_09]: And I've learned to look up these games and make sure...

586
00:40:09,292 --> 00:40:10,112
[SPEAKER_09]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

587
00:40:39,249 --> 00:40:40,095
[SPEAKER_06]: Do they have a Twitter?

588
00:40:41,325 --> 00:40:42,665
[SPEAKER_06]: They freaking have a Twitter.

589
00:40:43,246 --> 00:40:44,146
[SPEAKER_09]: But it's all in Japanese, right?

590
00:40:44,166 --> 00:40:45,586
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to follow the Japanese Twitter.

591
00:40:45,866 --> 00:40:46,466
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, you do that.

592
00:40:47,367 --> 00:40:52,968
[SPEAKER_09]: Actdeft in chat says, now the folks in chat are kind of looking at what we just posted.

593
00:40:54,309 --> 00:40:56,129
[SPEAKER_09]: Leo Shen says, I got my copy.

594
00:40:56,169 --> 00:40:59,510
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, he might have been talking about Beatmania because I just mentioned that.

595
00:41:00,270 --> 00:41:02,211
[SPEAKER_09]: Actdeft says, best Wii game ever.

596
00:41:02,291 --> 00:41:04,131
[SPEAKER_09]: Not even Epic Mickey will surpass this game.

597
00:41:04,151 --> 00:41:08,512
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, I found a description from the Twitter, so I'm running it through the Nifty Translator.

598
00:41:08,533 --> 00:41:10,193
[SPEAKER_06]: And we'll see what it says.

599
00:41:11,722 --> 00:41:12,541
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, let me know what happens.

600
00:41:14,832 --> 00:41:21,957
[SPEAKER_06]: Cat President and Choking Employee Recruitment on Large Scale Famous Cat Rena of the Superman Nature Blog finally appears in the game.

601
00:41:22,378 --> 00:41:25,020
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's work also by you under the Cat President.

602
00:41:25,661 --> 00:41:26,942
[SPEAKER_09]: What the hell does that mean?

603
00:41:27,142 --> 00:41:28,763
[SPEAKER_06]: Because it's translating.

604
00:41:29,043 --> 00:41:30,505
[SPEAKER_09]: That doesn't even fucking make sense.

605
00:41:30,565 --> 00:41:31,005
[SPEAKER_09]: I love it.

606
00:41:31,265 --> 00:41:34,168
[SPEAKER_06]: So he's like the President of Cats or something?

607
00:41:35,309 --> 00:41:39,012
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess this Cat Rena is a famous cat.

608
00:41:39,692 --> 00:41:41,554
[SPEAKER_06]: I've actually heard of the cat before.

609
00:41:43,901 --> 00:41:44,742
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm getting this game.

610
00:41:44,842 --> 00:41:45,202
[SPEAKER_06]: Fuck it.

611
00:41:45,242 --> 00:41:45,742
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm getting it.

612
00:41:47,322 --> 00:41:51,964
[SPEAKER_06]: Rob, let's get the communal OLR copy and find a Wii that we can play it on.

613
00:41:52,484 --> 00:41:52,944
[SPEAKER_08]: Amazing.

614
00:41:53,004 --> 00:41:53,924
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki has one, right?

615
00:41:54,224 --> 00:41:55,165
[SPEAKER_08]: I have a Wii that I'll play.

616
00:41:55,505 --> 00:41:56,225
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll have this game.

617
00:41:56,305 --> 00:41:56,645
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't worry.

618
00:41:56,965 --> 00:41:57,885
[SPEAKER_09]: It'll be coming.

619
00:41:58,025 --> 00:42:03,587
[SPEAKER_09]: Actually, this was just sent to me in chat is that we actually have an exclusive sneak peek at the soundtrack for this game.

620
00:42:03,627 --> 00:42:04,207
[SPEAKER_09]: It's amazing.

621
00:42:04,587 --> 00:42:06,688
[SPEAKER_12]: That sounds so familiar.

622
00:42:12,239 --> 00:42:17,305
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, the next sound you're going to hear is my microphone connecting with the back of Rob's head.

623
00:42:17,766 --> 00:42:18,046
[SPEAKER_06]: Ready?

624
00:42:18,807 --> 00:42:20,950
[SPEAKER_06]: One, two... Ow!

625
00:42:24,274 --> 00:42:27,838
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyhow, um... President Cat.

626
00:42:32,614 --> 00:42:38,021
[SPEAKER_09]: Seriously, every other podcast you listen to, every single one of them will mention Uncharted 2 this week.

627
00:42:38,122 --> 00:42:38,963
[SPEAKER_09]: And they will talk about it.

628
00:42:38,983 --> 00:42:40,465
[SPEAKER_09]: They will suck its dick to no end.

629
00:42:40,986 --> 00:42:43,088
[SPEAKER_09]: What other show are you going to hear about this game on, huh?

630
00:42:44,170 --> 00:42:44,791
[SPEAKER_09]: I challenge you.

631
00:42:44,891 --> 00:42:45,512
[SPEAKER_09]: What other show?

632
00:42:46,834 --> 00:42:48,596
[SPEAKER_09]: Watch, there's probably at least five other shows that mention it.

633
00:42:48,616 --> 00:42:49,177
[SPEAKER_09]: But seriously.

634
00:42:52,213 --> 00:42:52,794
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

635
00:43:10,972 --> 00:43:16,117
[SPEAKER_06]: If anyone who can read Japanese wants to follow their Twitter, it's RenaWii, R-E-N-A-W-I-I.

636
00:43:16,558 --> 00:43:19,200
[SPEAKER_06]: Someone go start translating that for me right now.

637
00:43:19,220 --> 00:43:21,682
[SPEAKER_06]: You need to tweet to them, quoting them or something.

638
00:43:21,843 --> 00:43:23,184
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, just tweet to them.

639
00:43:27,048 --> 00:43:28,870
[SPEAKER_09]: and say, release your game in English, please.

640
00:43:29,190 --> 00:43:29,830
[SPEAKER_09]: Best game ever.

641
00:43:30,271 --> 00:43:32,272
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to go on the OLR Twitter right now and tweet to them.

642
00:43:32,573 --> 00:43:34,995
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, I'm running their Twitter through Nifty.

643
00:43:35,435 --> 00:43:45,143
[SPEAKER_06]: I love... Anyone, if you want one of the best translators from Japanese to English, seriously, just look up Nifty Globalgate.

644
00:43:46,104 --> 00:43:48,386
[SPEAKER_06]: So, yeah.

645
00:43:48,666 --> 00:43:51,549
[SPEAKER_06]: They keep calling it President Rina.

646
00:43:53,372 --> 00:43:55,313
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to tweet them right now from the OLR account.

647
00:43:55,353 --> 00:43:57,794
[SPEAKER_09]: Can you send me the link to their Twitter in chat?

648
00:43:58,034 --> 00:43:58,234
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

649
00:43:58,474 --> 00:44:00,195
[SPEAKER_09]: And then can we do the UK releases?

650
00:44:00,455 --> 00:44:02,016
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry, I know you're trying to do five things at once.

651
00:44:03,016 --> 00:44:03,776
[SPEAKER_06]: Where's IRC?

652
00:44:03,796 --> 00:44:04,136
[SPEAKER_06]: There it is.

653
00:44:04,376 --> 00:44:04,677
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright.

654
00:44:06,317 --> 00:44:12,019
[SPEAKER_09]: So she's going to get me the Twitter there and I'm going to tweet them from the OLR account saying we demand that you release this game in English.

655
00:44:12,860 --> 00:44:15,060
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm linking it to the main chat room too because I want everyone.

656
00:44:15,180 --> 00:44:15,701
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, sweet.

657
00:44:16,441 --> 00:44:18,242
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to go tweet them right now.

658
00:44:18,262 --> 00:44:18,962
[SPEAKER_06]: We want this game.

659
00:44:20,242 --> 00:44:23,344
[SPEAKER_06]: We want President Satchel means President, by the way.

660
00:44:24,804 --> 00:44:26,665
[SPEAKER_06]: Rob, Satchel means President.

661
00:44:26,965 --> 00:44:27,325
[SPEAKER_09]: Gotcha.

662
00:44:27,446 --> 00:44:29,146
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, now I've learned a little Japanese today.

663
00:44:29,547 --> 00:44:29,807
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

664
00:44:31,287 --> 00:44:32,288
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's do UK releases.

665
00:44:33,135 --> 00:44:35,416
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, a ton of stuff on the 23rd.

666
00:44:35,456 --> 00:44:59,864
[SPEAKER_06]: We have Borderlands, we have CSI Deadly Intent, Fairytale Fights, Forza Motorsport 3, Ghostbusters on PSP, Grand Theft Auto Chinatown Wars on PSP, Lips, number one hits, what the fuck ever, Marvel Super Heroes Squad, Nintendo Presents Style Boutique, ew, Pro Evolution Soccer 2010, WWE Smackdown vs. Raw 2010, and that's it.

667
00:45:04,116 --> 00:45:07,078
[SPEAKER_09]: and President Cat!

668
00:45:07,239 --> 00:45:10,301
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm making an icon of President Cat.

669
00:45:10,861 --> 00:45:15,165
[SPEAKER_09]: We are talking about your game on our show right now and we demand you release it in English in the US.

670
00:45:15,525 --> 00:45:16,886
[SPEAKER_09]: President Cat for USA.

671
00:45:20,129 --> 00:45:22,451
[SPEAKER_09]: Please, retweet the fuck out of this, please.

672
00:45:22,771 --> 00:45:23,131
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

673
00:45:23,471 --> 00:45:24,372
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to post it shortly.

674
00:45:27,675 --> 00:45:27,915
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

675
00:45:29,651 --> 00:45:33,912
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, if any of our listeners that speak Japanese, please retweet it to them in Japanese.

676
00:45:33,992 --> 00:45:34,352
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

677
00:45:36,253 --> 00:45:37,013
[SPEAKER_09]: This needs to happen.

678
00:45:37,674 --> 00:45:38,214
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, anyway.

679
00:45:38,874 --> 00:45:42,155
[SPEAKER_09]: There's probably some people listening to this show right now like, what are they smoking tonight?

680
00:45:42,175 --> 00:45:43,115
[SPEAKER_06]: Release date 10-22.

681
00:45:44,115 --> 00:45:47,096
[SPEAKER_06]: Countdown will deliver a picture of their cute and funny friend, Rina.

682
00:45:47,356 --> 00:45:49,557
[SPEAKER_09]: Is a marijuana farm burning in Sacramento tonight?

683
00:45:49,637 --> 00:45:50,537
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, seriously.

684
00:45:51,518 --> 00:45:52,098
[SPEAKER_09]: What is going on?

685
00:45:53,118 --> 00:45:55,979
[SPEAKER_09]: SSJ100 Matt says, Shermie is secretary of catnip.

686
00:45:57,240 --> 00:45:58,400
[SPEAKER_04]: Dude, I love this cat.

687
00:45:59,192 --> 00:45:59,412
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

688
00:45:59,852 --> 00:46:03,835
[SPEAKER_09]: Moving on, there's other video gaming stories, believe it or not, other than President Cat.

689
00:46:03,855 --> 00:46:04,796
[SPEAKER_09]: We will keep you posted.

690
00:46:05,076 --> 00:46:09,559
[SPEAKER_09]: Please, again, please, please, please, retweet our message to Reno We.

691
00:46:09,599 --> 00:46:10,720
[SPEAKER_09]: We want them to notice.

692
00:46:11,261 --> 00:46:11,761
[SPEAKER_09]: Please.

693
00:46:12,481 --> 00:46:12,682
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

694
00:46:12,902 --> 00:46:14,183
[SPEAKER_14]: We want President Cat!

695
00:46:14,363 --> 00:46:14,703
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

696
00:46:15,283 --> 00:46:20,287
[SPEAKER_08]: In other news that's not President Cat related and unfortunately makes it less important...

697
00:46:21,119 --> 00:46:27,863
[SPEAKER_08]: is Blaze, which is a company that makes third-party peripherals for game systems like the Wii and the PlayStation 3.

698
00:46:28,583 --> 00:46:37,387
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, they have now put out a brand new motion 3D controller that looks exactly like a Wii remote.

699
00:46:37,928 --> 00:46:40,529
[SPEAKER_08]: So much so, I wouldn't be surprised if they get sued for it.

700
00:46:41,810 --> 00:46:43,671
[SPEAKER_08]: But, hey, whatever.

701
00:46:43,711 --> 00:46:46,592
[SPEAKER_08]: It says it works fine as Sega Tennis and Tiger Woods.

702
00:46:48,133 --> 00:46:48,293
[SPEAKER_08]: But,

703
00:46:48,962 --> 00:46:50,903
[SPEAKER_08]: It looks exactly like a Wii Remote.

704
00:46:52,985 --> 00:46:54,206
[SPEAKER_08]: Good luck with your lawsuit.

705
00:46:57,368 --> 00:47:00,490
[SPEAKER_08]: However... There's always a however.

706
00:47:01,130 --> 00:47:07,154
[SPEAKER_08]: However, it will not work with President Cat because President Cat is coming out on the Wii and not the PlayStation 3.

707
00:47:07,955 --> 00:47:15,220
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway... I'm also making a call, by the way, for making President Cat be a trending topic.

708
00:47:17,250 --> 00:47:17,890
[SPEAKER_09]: I hope it works.

709
00:47:18,310 --> 00:47:19,510
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, here's the thing.

710
00:47:21,151 --> 00:47:29,232
[SPEAKER_09]: Why are they doing this when the PlayStation 3 is doing their own, and how are they possibly getting away with it without Sony bringing the SmackDown?

711
00:47:29,272 --> 00:47:35,573
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, doesn't this kind of thing have to have some type of Sony license anyway, especially considering the fact that it works with existing games?

712
00:47:35,913 --> 00:47:36,154
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe.

713
00:47:36,654 --> 00:47:43,895
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know how they're doing it, but it'll be, I don't know, something that's not...

714
00:47:45,473 --> 00:47:46,233
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks for watching!

715
00:48:10,956 --> 00:48:13,257
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, it looks like it's missing most of the buttons on there.

716
00:48:14,458 --> 00:48:15,699
[SPEAKER_08]: So, I don't know.

717
00:48:17,240 --> 00:48:18,180
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm confused.

718
00:48:20,001 --> 00:48:28,706
[SPEAKER_09]: It just looks like a cheap knockoff, which I'm sure it is, but I still don't understand the legal end of it, like how they can possibly get away with it and how Sony is letting it happen.

719
00:48:29,907 --> 00:48:35,630
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess it looks different enough than the Wii Remote, but it's basically got the trigger underneath where the B button would normally be.

720
00:48:36,131 --> 00:48:38,432
[SPEAKER_08]: It's got the directional pad at the top, just like...

721
00:48:39,329 --> 00:48:39,849
[SPEAKER_08]: TheWeeRemote

722
00:49:10,414 --> 00:49:13,356
[SPEAKER_09]: but it looks like cheap knockoff crap and you'd better just wait for the real thing.

723
00:49:13,416 --> 00:49:20,061
[SPEAKER_08]: It's tough when they're making this controller that really serves somewhat of a purpose but it's not that important.

724
00:49:20,381 --> 00:49:29,708
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not anything like the FragFX or something like that where you're actually making something that you use a mouse to aim or something like that so it's more like a PC.

725
00:49:30,268 --> 00:49:38,154
[SPEAKER_08]: But this I guess it's more immersive for Tiger Woods but I'd really just wait for the official release

726
00:49:39,389 --> 00:49:40,811
[SPEAKER_08]: and the official thing comes out I don't know

727
00:49:51,465 --> 00:49:54,547
[SPEAKER_09]: Fantasy Star Portable 2 is going to be getting some product placement.

728
00:50:11,981 --> 00:50:14,462
[SPEAKER_09]: and it's kind of extreme.

729
00:50:14,863 --> 00:50:22,446
[SPEAKER_09]: First off, there's going to be Fanta products in the game, like the drink, you know, one of Fanta, that whole thing, are going to be showing up in Fanta.

730
00:50:22,466 --> 00:50:23,327
[SPEAKER_09]: Those are still around.

731
00:50:23,487 --> 00:50:27,569
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you're talking about the official drink of Germany during World War II.

732
00:50:27,629 --> 00:50:28,069
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess.

733
00:50:28,509 --> 00:50:34,432
[SPEAKER_09]: But then also, something to note is that Pizza Hut branding is now going to show up in the game.

734
00:50:35,352 --> 00:50:43,857
[SPEAKER_09]: Apparently, you're actually going to be able to have pizza-related shields and swords and things of that note.

735
00:50:44,097 --> 00:50:56,065
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm looking at the site that is running this story here, andreasang.com, A-N-D-R-A-S-A-N-G.com, and they actually have screenshots of this chick, and it doesn't look Photoshopped.

736
00:50:56,085 --> 00:50:57,145
[SPEAKER_09]: I think this is the real deal.

737
00:50:57,445 --> 00:50:58,066
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, that's the real deal.

738
00:50:58,166 --> 00:51:01,448
[SPEAKER_09]: A little Pizza Hut box and a pizza pan.

739
00:51:02,577 --> 00:51:12,760
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, you will actually be able to get like pizza to seafood mix pizza for $2,500 meseta and cheese and cheese pizza for $1,900 meseta will actually be available in the game.

740
00:51:14,640 --> 00:51:17,201
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a little like pizza place in the game and so forth.

741
00:51:17,281 --> 00:51:24,322
[SPEAKER_09]: So, I mean, I just don't really like get it like a that sword and shield is God awful ugly.

742
00:51:25,543 --> 00:51:26,103
[SPEAKER_09]: But, um,

743
00:51:27,884 --> 00:51:30,465
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, what does pizza have to do with Phantasy Star?

744
00:51:30,505 --> 00:51:37,187
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, I guess it's like product placement, just like you see in the billboards in the racing games here in the US, but it's a little extreme, don't you think?

745
00:51:37,568 --> 00:51:41,089
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, keep in mind, Sega had a whole game based around Pepsi.

746
00:51:42,870 --> 00:51:43,930
[SPEAKER_06]: This isn't far-fetched.

747
00:51:45,501 --> 00:51:46,041
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess.

748
00:51:46,102 --> 00:51:47,082
[SPEAKER_06]: Pepsi Man, Rob.

749
00:51:47,823 --> 00:51:49,704
[SPEAKER_06]: They need Pepsi Man versus Pizza Hut.

750
00:51:49,864 --> 00:51:52,707
[SPEAKER_09]: You can't help but go, okay, this is a little bit much.

751
00:51:52,967 --> 00:51:57,290
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, it's one thing in Crazy Taxi to have the KFC and Pizza Hut that you have to drop people off.

752
00:51:57,310 --> 00:51:59,272
[SPEAKER_09]: Doesn't Pepsi Cola own Pizza Hut?

753
00:52:00,072 --> 00:52:00,653
[SPEAKER_09]: I think so, yeah.

754
00:52:02,086 --> 00:52:03,187
[SPEAKER_09]: Is Pepsi going to buy Sega?

755
00:52:03,267 --> 00:52:04,028
[SPEAKER_09]: Is that where we're going?

756
00:52:04,248 --> 00:52:05,670
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe that's just what's going to happen.

757
00:52:05,690 --> 00:52:06,911
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

758
00:52:06,991 --> 00:52:12,477
[SPEAKER_09]: TigerClaw in chat says, I remember seeing Pizza Hut billboards in TMNT 2, the arcade on the NES.

759
00:52:12,857 --> 00:52:15,620
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, it's not that product placement in video games is anything new.

760
00:52:15,800 --> 00:52:17,762
[SPEAKER_09]: It was Domino's in the movie.

761
00:52:18,123 --> 00:52:19,564
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know if it's often talked about.

762
00:52:20,592 --> 00:52:28,995
[SPEAKER_09]: But, I mean, when it gets in your face so much, it's like you're carrying around a giant Pizza Hut box and, I guess, hitting monsters with it or blocking their attacks with it.

763
00:52:29,576 --> 00:52:34,578
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, it kind of starts to cross the line of WTF, LOL.

764
00:52:36,659 --> 00:52:41,581
[SPEAKER_09]: Deathwishing says the acceptable games with product placement are sports and racing games unless they're futuristic.

765
00:52:41,881 --> 00:52:44,762
[SPEAKER_09]: But if it's a shooter or RPG, no, no.

766
00:52:44,982 --> 00:52:47,283
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's not cheeseball enough to where, you know...

767
00:52:47,918 --> 00:52:59,997
[SPEAKER_08]: They really could be over the top with everything like, you know, have product placement everywhere and just like ridiculous weapons based on, you know, the golden arches or something, you know, that'd be kind of funny.

768
00:53:02,125 --> 00:53:03,046
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

769
00:53:21,202 --> 00:53:29,625
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you play as the cat, and you are part of a trio called Let's Going 3, so I'm guessing it'd be Ikimasu 3, I guess.

770
00:53:31,846 --> 00:53:35,728
[SPEAKER_06]: And they are a very, very popular trio of cats.

771
00:53:36,448 --> 00:53:48,533
[SPEAKER_06]: And so, Rina, who is the editor-in-chief of production of a company, I guess, that puts out Shougakugen, which is like a shoujo manga.

772
00:53:49,574 --> 00:53:50,895
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

773
00:54:14,085 --> 00:54:14,485
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for watching!

774
00:54:38,703 --> 00:54:44,521
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, because this is kind of like, the Wii is kind of a preposterous system to begin with.

775
00:54:44,842 --> 00:54:46,426
[SPEAKER_09]: This game just is right at home.

776
00:54:47,865 --> 00:54:50,707
[SPEAKER_09]: We need some more games that are just OMG WTF like this.

777
00:54:51,307 --> 00:54:51,687
[SPEAKER_09]: Amazing.

778
00:54:51,907 --> 00:54:55,870
[SPEAKER_06]: And Amazon JP is selling it for 4,410 yen.

779
00:54:56,350 --> 00:54:57,211
[SPEAKER_09]: When does it come out?

780
00:54:57,231 --> 00:54:59,292
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh no, duh, I just read it during Japanese releases.

781
00:54:59,312 --> 00:55:01,113
[SPEAKER_09]: It's out this week.

782
00:55:01,433 --> 00:55:02,574
[SPEAKER_06]: Someone buy me this!

783
00:55:04,035 --> 00:55:07,036
[SPEAKER_06]: Seriously, this is the type of random crap I would buy on Dreamcast.

784
00:55:07,517 --> 00:55:09,438
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, okay, I bought Super Producers.

785
00:55:10,258 --> 00:55:12,360
[SPEAKER_06]: If that game isn't random, I don't know what is.

786
00:55:13,080 --> 00:55:16,102
[SPEAKER_06]: Or like, what was it, the Roommate 202 or something?

787
00:55:16,122 --> 00:55:16,202
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

788
00:55:17,291 --> 00:55:17,972
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

789
00:55:38,433 --> 00:55:39,453
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's fantastic.

790
00:55:40,654 --> 00:55:45,295
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, so Microsoft seems to think that the PS3 is screwed this year.

791
00:55:45,715 --> 00:55:48,916
[SPEAKER_06]: They think that the 360 will outsell the PS3.

792
00:55:49,856 --> 00:56:06,821
[SPEAKER_06]: Aaron Greenberg, who is the big mouth of Microsoft, is saying that when NPD releases the September sales, they expect the PS3 is going to come in with the most units sold for the month.

793
00:56:07,501 --> 00:56:17,408
[SPEAKER_06]: because of the slim release, but overall that the Xbox 360 is still going to outsell for the calendar year and for the entire system generation.

794
00:56:19,369 --> 00:56:27,354
[SPEAKER_06]: He compares it to a game of baseball where they may be ahead one inning, but it's what you get by the end of the game that's what counts.

795
00:56:30,417 --> 00:56:33,138
[SPEAKER_09]: So you may have won the battle, but you haven't won the war type of thing.

796
00:56:33,379 --> 00:56:33,879
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly.

797
00:56:34,319 --> 00:56:35,280
[SPEAKER_09]: This is just one month.

798
00:56:36,645 --> 00:56:38,586
[SPEAKER_06]: And I have to agree with the article, this is burn.

799
00:56:38,946 --> 00:56:47,189
[SPEAKER_06]: He's quoted saying, Sony, for example, has publicly noted that they lose money on every console they sell, and with the price cut, they're now losing even more money.

800
00:56:47,509 --> 00:56:54,052
[SPEAKER_06]: So even with the PS3 in the market today at $299, you have to question if their business model is sustainable.

801
00:56:56,497 --> 00:56:56,957
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

802
00:56:57,398 --> 00:57:07,644
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, as much as I think, you know, and I do admit I've been kind of in the past, especially on this show, like really slanted towards 360.

803
00:57:08,144 --> 00:57:16,509
[SPEAKER_09]: I think especially this year I have come a long way towards, and I don't mean in reporting, I mean in, you know, just what I play myself and what I've enjoyed.

804
00:57:16,849 --> 00:57:19,531
[SPEAKER_09]: I think this year especially I think PS3's gained a lot with me.

805
00:57:20,251 --> 00:57:25,894
[SPEAKER_09]: and I think, you know, kind of going into this holiday season, I think the prize drop was the best freaking thing they could do.

806
00:57:26,414 --> 00:57:42,703
[SPEAKER_09]: Let me tell you a true story, totally true, is that the other night I was eating dinner with some co-workers and the people at the table next to us, some like husbands and wives, about six of them in their mid-twenties and they were talking about

807
00:57:44,106 --> 00:57:47,488
[SPEAKER_09]: And so I couldn't help but overhear because I'm a nosy motherfucker.

808
00:57:47,948 --> 00:57:51,650
[SPEAKER_09]: So I actually heard them talking about the Xbox 360 and the PlayStation 3.

809
00:57:51,910 --> 00:57:54,311
[SPEAKER_09]: And the guy was talking about how he's going to sell back his 360.

810
00:57:54,732 --> 00:57:58,073
[SPEAKER_09]: And the one guy actually said, and it had nothing to do with the quality.

811
00:57:58,113 --> 00:57:59,734
[SPEAKER_09]: I think they were talking finances or something.

812
00:57:59,754 --> 00:57:59,994
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

813
00:58:00,014 --> 00:58:00,615
[SPEAKER_09]: I didn't hear everything.

814
00:58:00,995 --> 00:58:04,356
[SPEAKER_09]: But the one guy said, well, you know, this holiday season, I kind of want to get a game system.

815
00:58:04,376 --> 00:58:07,698
[SPEAKER_09]: But I think I want to get a PlayStation 3 because, dude, it has Blu-ray.

816
00:58:08,899 --> 00:58:09,419
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, and...

817
00:58:11,048 --> 00:58:19,552
[SPEAKER_09]: And now that those systems are getting closer to the same price, you know, again, I don't think these guys were like hardcore gamers, but they are just average people I overheard at a restaurant.

818
00:58:20,092 --> 00:58:25,155
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that Blu-ray this Christmas season is going to carry a lot of weight and Microsoft's going to feel it.

819
00:58:26,058 --> 00:58:33,103
[SPEAKER_06]: But you can get a better quality Blu-ray player now for cheaper than the entire system costs.

820
00:58:34,284 --> 00:58:39,327
[SPEAKER_06]: For the cost of a good PS3 bundle, you could buy an Xbox 360 and a better Blu-ray player.

821
00:58:39,667 --> 00:58:45,671
[SPEAKER_09]: I get that, but what about that PlayStation 2 is a DVD player mentality that really helped out that system when it needed it?

822
00:58:47,212 --> 00:58:49,854
[SPEAKER_09]: You, me, the other gamers of America, we get that.

823
00:58:50,214 --> 00:58:55,738
[SPEAKER_09]: But the people that are purchasing things in mass from Walmart and Target to put under Christmas trees, are they going to get that?

824
00:58:56,906 --> 00:59:02,048
[SPEAKER_06]: I still don't think that it's enough to save the system.

825
00:59:02,448 --> 00:59:04,949
[SPEAKER_06]: I would have to see hard numbers.

826
00:59:05,089 --> 00:59:07,330
[SPEAKER_06]: I would have to look at their financial reports.

827
00:59:07,370 --> 00:59:10,811
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd have to see what it costs to produce as a system, what their marketing costs.

828
00:59:10,931 --> 00:59:15,893
[SPEAKER_06]: Basically, I'd have to see overhead versus sales to get an idea to project.

829
00:59:16,473 --> 00:59:25,937
[SPEAKER_06]: It seems to me that they would have to sell a hell of a lot to make up past losses and their current losses for overall system sales versus the overhead.

830
00:59:26,894 --> 00:59:29,836
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, don't get me wrong, I haven't... Can you tell I've been working in finance too long?

831
00:59:30,216 --> 00:59:34,819
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, don't get me wrong, I'm not trying to say that I've suddenly, you know, hate the 360.

832
00:59:34,859 --> 00:59:35,720
[SPEAKER_09]: That's certainly not true.

833
00:59:35,780 --> 00:59:42,624
[SPEAKER_09]: I think either way, it's going to be, you know, Microsoft's going to definitely give them a run for their money, and they're probably, in the end, will still come out ahead.

834
00:59:42,644 --> 00:59:46,647
[SPEAKER_09]: But I think if they were smart, what Microsoft would do is kind of go for the jugular.

835
00:59:46,707 --> 00:59:47,588
[SPEAKER_09]: What's the biggest...

836
00:59:48,328 --> 00:59:51,830
[SPEAKER_09]: for the mass population asset of the PlayStation 3, Blu-ray.

837
00:59:52,131 --> 00:59:53,432
[SPEAKER_09]: But what does the 360 have?

838
00:59:53,792 --> 00:59:56,894
[SPEAKER_09]: Downloadable movies with Netflix, specifically.

839
00:59:57,394 --> 01:00:09,362
[SPEAKER_09]: I think if they start marketing a lot with that and their Netflix partnership, they are very likely to keep their head above water and not let Sony get them down too bad outside of just September.

840
01:00:09,482 --> 01:00:09,983
[SPEAKER_09]: But we'll see.

841
01:00:10,803 --> 01:00:12,384
[SPEAKER_09]: It's going to be a very interesting holiday season.

842
01:00:12,404 --> 01:00:13,145
[SPEAKER_09]: I can't wait to see what happens.

843
01:00:13,205 --> 01:00:14,986
[SPEAKER_04]: I know what would save the PS3, Rob.

844
01:00:15,847 --> 01:00:16,027
[SPEAKER_09]: What?

845
01:00:16,187 --> 01:00:16,968
[SPEAKER_04]: President Cat.

846
01:00:17,348 --> 01:00:17,488
Shh.

847
01:00:19,315 --> 01:00:20,196
[SPEAKER_09]: Or how about Daytona?

848
01:00:22,297 --> 01:00:25,159
[SPEAKER_14]: No, President Cat.

849
01:00:25,500 --> 01:00:26,460
[SPEAKER_14]: Rina for President!

850
01:00:26,861 --> 01:00:27,421
[SPEAKER_09]: Moving on.

851
01:00:28,122 --> 01:00:30,043
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki, more video game news, please.

852
01:00:30,603 --> 01:00:31,684
[SPEAKER_08]: That doesn't have to do with cats.

853
01:00:32,345 --> 01:00:37,328
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, one thing that Sony doesn't have, unfortunately, is the Ballad of Gay Tony.

854
01:00:38,049 --> 01:00:40,311
[SPEAKER_08]: And that will be coming out, actually, next week.

855
01:00:41,856 --> 01:00:43,037
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, 29th, I guess, two weeks.

856
01:00:44,778 --> 01:00:51,203
[SPEAKER_08]: They did release some new information regarding the multiplayer in the new episode for the 360.

857
01:00:53,085 --> 01:01:00,711
[SPEAKER_08]: Some of the things that they get, new areas to have deathmatch and team deathmatches, including some new enclosed areas as well.

858
01:01:02,453 --> 01:01:03,514
[SPEAKER_08]: Some that are actually...

859
01:01:05,177 --> 01:01:23,616
[SPEAKER_08]: in the clubs, they have most of the deathmatch maps that are out there right now for Grand Theft Auto were all just pretty much spots in the city but these are actually in addition to that stuff at least I hope it's in addition to that and not just replacing it because that would really suck if they did replace it

860
01:01:26,133 --> 01:01:32,059
[SPEAKER_08]: Some other new things adding to Deathmatch other than just locations.

861
01:01:32,519 --> 01:01:44,792
[SPEAKER_08]: They have killstreak bonuses where if you kill 3 people, 5 people, or 10 people in a row you get health and armor bonuses and also if someone kills you breaking your streak they will earn $125 instead of just $100.

862
01:01:47,875 --> 01:01:56,720
[SPEAKER_08]: Also, for assists, where you do damage to somebody and someone else takes the kill for it, you also make $25 for that, whereas before you made nothing.

863
01:01:58,041 --> 01:02:02,043
[SPEAKER_08]: And, of course, they have new weapon classes to break things apart.

864
01:02:02,123 --> 01:02:06,986
[SPEAKER_08]: They've got episodic, automatic, sniper rifles, explosives, and sticky bombs.

865
01:02:07,507 --> 01:02:09,448
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm kind of interested about the episodic.

866
01:02:09,488 --> 01:02:11,489
[SPEAKER_08]: Lol, Gay Tony has sticky bombs.

867
01:02:13,749 --> 01:02:14,310
[SPEAKER_08]: Ha ha ha.

868
01:02:14,670 --> 01:02:26,401
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I'm interested to see, though, if they actually, since it does have episodic, if it will include both the first and second episodes, which would be pretty awesome if they had some sort of cross-play with that.

869
01:02:27,562 --> 01:02:38,693
[SPEAKER_08]: Free mode, they've added some new options, including the ability to use the parachutes in the game, and of course your tanks and the new buzzard attack helicopter, which is pretty awesome.

870
01:02:41,047 --> 01:03:09,001
[SPEAKER_08]: and that's pretty much it for right now but very excited about this new expansion coming out okay so I have to admit like as somebody who doesn't really play a lot of Grand Theft Auto a lot of that was blah blah blah to me so you have to kind of translate is this going to be a good thing for the game yes it's gonna be awesome it's gonna basically enhance multiplayer a lot and bring it to the over-the-topness of the other Grand Theft Auto games all right and that's what people love about it right yes all right um

871
01:03:09,628 --> 01:03:10,429
[SPEAKER_09]: Left 4 Dead 2 Boycott Group

872
01:03:25,770 --> 01:03:28,632
[SPEAKER_09]: And this has to do with one of the co-founders, Agent of Chaos.

873
01:03:28,872 --> 01:03:32,795
[SPEAKER_09]: You might remember a couple weeks ago we talked about how they actually got invited to Valve's headquarters and so forth.

874
01:03:32,815 --> 01:03:39,299
[SPEAKER_09]: And we were kind of joking, oh, sold out and all this stuff, which certainly the community was accusing them of.

875
01:03:39,860 --> 01:03:43,862
[SPEAKER_09]: But they said, quote, our goal wasn't to steer people away from Left 4 Dead 2.

876
01:03:44,683 --> 01:03:48,265
[SPEAKER_09]: It was to get Valve's attention and have them support Left 4 Dead.

877
01:03:48,886 --> 01:03:54,990
[SPEAKER_09]: So apparently since they have continued to support Left 4 Dead with content, they have declared the boycott over.

878
01:03:55,710 --> 01:03:57,752
[SPEAKER_09]: The Boycott was a little silly.

879
01:04:16,325 --> 01:04:20,146
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you think they'll continue to support Left 4 Dead 1 even while Left 4 Dead 2 is out?

880
01:04:20,226 --> 01:04:23,447
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, EverQuest 1 still got upgrade packs and EverQuest 2 is out.

881
01:04:23,467 --> 01:04:23,687
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe.

882
01:04:24,027 --> 01:04:24,587
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

883
01:04:24,687 --> 01:04:24,987
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe.

884
01:04:25,367 --> 01:04:25,827
[SPEAKER_08]: You never know.

885
01:04:26,887 --> 01:04:32,709
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, you know, I never understood the boycott to begin with, so I can't say this is... Well, actually, it is surprising.

886
01:04:32,769 --> 01:04:34,629
[SPEAKER_09]: You don't usually hear about boycotts coming to an end.

887
01:04:35,009 --> 01:04:37,530
[SPEAKER_09]: You just hear about, come to my online petition and sign it.

888
01:04:37,590 --> 01:04:45,852
[SPEAKER_09]: So I guess I have to say I haven't really heard that before, but it is kind of lol-tastic that those guys actually went out to Valve and now they're canceling their boycott, but, you know, whatever.

889
01:04:47,236 --> 01:04:48,037
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

890
01:05:17,219 --> 01:05:17,759
[SPEAKER_08]: Who cares?

891
01:05:18,220 --> 01:05:19,800
[SPEAKER_08]: You buy it or you don't buy it.

892
01:05:20,601 --> 01:05:21,481
[SPEAKER_08]: That's it.

893
01:05:22,202 --> 01:05:24,063
[SPEAKER_08]: And you'll bitch and moan about it all you want.

894
01:05:24,503 --> 01:05:26,404
[SPEAKER_08]: And post to the internet on your favorite forum.

895
01:05:26,504 --> 01:05:27,925
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, post to the internet.

896
01:05:28,005 --> 01:05:29,926
[SPEAKER_08]: Complain that it's not President Cat.

897
01:05:30,326 --> 01:05:35,929
[SPEAKER_08]: And then you'll just buy it anyways because you're a consumer whore.

898
01:05:36,689 --> 01:05:37,049
[SPEAKER_08]: And how.

899
01:05:38,720 --> 01:05:39,381
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

900
01:06:03,257 --> 01:06:04,658
[SPEAKER_09]: Fine, you swam.

901
01:06:04,778 --> 01:06:05,499
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know what you did.

902
01:06:05,659 --> 01:06:06,459
[SPEAKER_09]: Whatever you did.

903
01:06:06,619 --> 01:06:09,842
[SPEAKER_09]: The classic game is... Dude, you're way in there.

904
01:06:10,322 --> 01:06:11,083
[SPEAKER_06]: It's Hexen.

905
01:06:12,944 --> 01:06:15,306
[SPEAKER_06]: Not Heretic, but Hexen.

906
01:06:16,306 --> 01:06:21,110
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is actually the best quality of music I can find other than having the... Punch.

907
01:06:21,590 --> 01:06:21,991
[SPEAKER_06]: Smack.

908
01:06:22,051 --> 01:06:22,391
[SPEAKER_06]: Chicken.

909
01:06:23,952 --> 01:06:31,237
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, Hexen is a first-person shooter that was put up by Raven and published by ID... ID...

910
01:06:33,999 --> 01:06:47,764
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's actually a sequel to Heretic, however it has better points to it, which makes me really put it over the first one that came out.

911
01:06:48,324 --> 01:06:50,525
[SPEAKER_06]: There were PlayStation Saturn and N64 versions.

912
01:06:53,446 --> 01:06:57,588
[SPEAKER_06]: But the N64 one was the only really good one that came out.

913
01:06:57,708 --> 01:06:59,389
[SPEAKER_06]: It was the best conversion.

914
01:07:00,069 --> 01:07:04,952
[SPEAKER_06]: The Saturn and PlayStation ones actually had some... They were only one player and had some frame rate losses.

915
01:07:06,112 --> 01:07:10,595
[SPEAKER_06]: So anyway, you are playing as Kronos, who is...

916
01:07:14,523 --> 01:07:16,305
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

917
01:07:34,867 --> 01:07:36,709
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's, you know, it's first person.

918
01:07:36,909 --> 01:07:43,817
[SPEAKER_06]: It's, you go through these, you know, sprightly, fake 3D places and smite things.

919
01:07:44,418 --> 01:07:45,659
[SPEAKER_09]: It was Doom with magic.

920
01:07:45,919 --> 01:07:46,760
[SPEAKER_06]: It was Doom with magic.

921
01:07:46,820 --> 01:07:49,223
[SPEAKER_06]: And actually, Hexen uses the Doom engine.

922
01:07:50,720 --> 01:07:51,400
[SPEAKER_06]: So you can jump.

923
01:07:52,061 --> 01:07:52,721
[SPEAKER_06]: You can jump.

924
01:07:53,141 --> 01:07:55,903
[SPEAKER_06]: You also have a hub system of level progression.

925
01:07:56,923 --> 01:08:03,967
[SPEAKER_06]: And, um, this one actually had, where the previous ones used all MIDI music, this one actually used, um, full Redbook audio.

926
01:08:04,027 --> 01:08:04,087
[SPEAKER_06]: Um...

927
01:08:08,757 --> 01:08:16,783
[SPEAKER_06]: You've got moving walls in the game, so they actually had to modify Doom's engine.

928
01:08:17,524 --> 01:08:25,050
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, the source code was released in 2008, so now you can get Hexen for Linux, which is pretty good.

929
01:08:25,530 --> 01:08:29,353
[SPEAKER_06]: And also, it's compatible with a lot of the Doom source ports.

930
01:08:30,414 --> 01:08:35,197
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, there was an expansion pack called Death Kings of the Dark Citadel.

931
01:08:36,218 --> 01:08:41,081
[SPEAKER_06]: And, um, you could have, uh, it had 20 new levels and deathmatch levels.

932
01:08:42,282 --> 01:08:47,225
[SPEAKER_06]: And, um, you actually had to, uh, either buy it in store or buy mail order.

933
01:08:48,186 --> 01:08:48,266
[SPEAKER_06]: Um...

934
01:08:50,287 --> 01:08:51,928
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just a really good game.

935
01:08:51,948 --> 01:08:57,010
[SPEAKER_06]: It actually had some of the best cheats ever in it.

936
01:08:57,030 --> 01:08:59,231
[SPEAKER_06]: The NRA code was all weapons.

937
01:09:00,611 --> 01:09:00,871
[SPEAKER_09]: Nice.

938
01:09:00,891 --> 01:09:03,292
[SPEAKER_06]: You can turn yourself into a chicken.

939
01:09:04,313 --> 01:09:06,234
[SPEAKER_03]: Seriously, you can turn yourself into a chicken.

940
01:09:06,254 --> 01:09:07,254
[SPEAKER_09]: It's the anti-Zelda.

941
01:09:07,594 --> 01:09:09,555
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a fun game.

942
01:09:10,513 --> 01:09:17,039
[SPEAKER_09]: And I know you usually don't like first-person shooters because they make you sick because they're so realistic, but this was like right before.

943
01:09:17,339 --> 01:09:18,640
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, sprite-based isn't as bad.

944
01:09:18,740 --> 01:09:20,041
[SPEAKER_06]: It didn't really make me all that motion sick.

945
01:09:20,101 --> 01:09:28,008
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I'd have to stop because I'd get headaches, but it didn't really make me full-on sick to my stomach, ready to throw up, you know, on the cat or anything.

946
01:09:29,009 --> 01:09:29,289
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

947
01:09:29,653 --> 01:09:34,874
[SPEAKER_09]: There you go, kids, your classic game of the week, Hexen from id, which you can still get.

948
01:09:34,914 --> 01:09:37,455
[SPEAKER_09]: In fact, someone in chat was saying they were just playing it earlier today.

949
01:09:38,135 --> 01:09:38,975
[SPEAKER_09]: Who was saying that?

950
01:09:39,075 --> 01:09:40,376
[SPEAKER_09]: I just saw it in chat a minute ago.

951
01:09:43,136 --> 01:09:44,557
[SPEAKER_09]: Gosh, I'm behind on chat or something.

952
01:09:45,297 --> 01:09:46,337
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry, somebody had said they were playing.

953
01:09:46,377 --> 01:09:46,757
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, there it is.

954
01:09:46,797 --> 01:09:49,238
[SPEAKER_09]: Frisbee says, I was just playing this online today through Skulltag.

955
01:09:49,678 --> 01:09:51,659
[SPEAKER_09]: So you can play it, I guess, online in different places.

956
01:09:52,759 --> 01:09:53,239
[SPEAKER_09]: So check it out.

957
01:09:56,092 --> 01:09:59,054
[SPEAKER_09]: Deathwishing, I guess, hasn't heard the chat on the show before.

958
01:09:59,434 --> 01:10:02,116
[SPEAKER_09]: Wants to know, how do you get sick from playing first-person shooters?

959
01:10:03,277 --> 01:10:03,997
[SPEAKER_06]: It's called vertigo.

960
01:10:05,738 --> 01:10:09,501
[SPEAKER_09]: I have a friend at work who has that real bad, too.

961
01:10:09,741 --> 01:10:10,601
[SPEAKER_09]: She can't get on boats.

962
01:10:11,482 --> 01:10:12,382
[SPEAKER_09]: It makes her very sick.

963
01:10:13,523 --> 01:10:16,105
[SPEAKER_06]: I really don't know what it is.

964
01:10:16,165 --> 01:10:18,826
[SPEAKER_06]: It's something between the eye and inner ear, I guess.

965
01:10:19,927 --> 01:10:21,068
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like, I guess...

966
01:10:22,953 --> 01:10:36,720
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's that your brain starts compensating for the motion that it sees when your body isn't feeling the same motion and it causes a conflict in your balance and that just makes me sick right away.

967
01:10:37,201 --> 01:10:40,943
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, another thing that will do it to me is rendering errors.

968
01:10:41,603 --> 01:10:51,168
[SPEAKER_06]: When Sonic Adventure, when the Japanese version had all those bad rendering errors and the collision detection wasn't bad and you could actually see through the wall at some points and see the edge...

969
01:10:51,588 --> 01:10:52,769
[SPEAKER_06]: I couldn't process it.

970
01:10:52,969 --> 01:10:53,869
[SPEAKER_06]: It would just stop.

971
01:10:54,530 --> 01:10:58,151
[SPEAKER_06]: I would literally have to close my eyes because it would make my head hurt.

972
01:10:59,212 --> 01:11:01,553
[SPEAKER_09]: Hungry Mr. Crunk in chat says, I can't play Spyro.

973
01:11:01,593 --> 01:11:02,113
[SPEAKER_09]: I get sick.

974
01:11:02,153 --> 01:11:04,635
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, is that motion sickness or just because you're playing Spyro?

975
01:11:06,375 --> 01:11:09,137
[SPEAKER_09]: Brad from PodCulture says, well, Vertigo is a good flick.

976
01:11:10,620 --> 01:11:12,341
[SPEAKER_06]: Vertigo, shoot.

977
01:11:12,521 --> 01:11:25,085
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a good movie, but... I did know who did the opening credits for that, too, because we studied it in my typography, or my graphic design class, because the opening titles to it were so amazing.

978
01:11:25,565 --> 01:11:26,786
[SPEAKER_09]: Wasn't it the same as Psycho?

979
01:11:26,986 --> 01:11:28,126
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it was Saul Bass.

980
01:11:28,286 --> 01:11:32,928
[SPEAKER_06]: Saul Bass is seriously the best movie title designer ever, but I digress.

981
01:11:34,195 --> 01:11:36,539
[SPEAKER_09]: Deathwishing just seems to think it's bad games that make you sick.

982
01:11:37,240 --> 01:11:44,852
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, Goldeneye, which is supposed to be one of the best N64 first-person shooters, made me really sick.

983
01:11:44,972 --> 01:11:46,134
[SPEAKER_06]: I couldn't play Unreal.

984
01:11:49,779 --> 01:11:51,421
[SPEAKER_06]: I couldn't play Portal.

985
01:11:51,501 --> 01:11:52,202
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh my god.

986
01:11:52,942 --> 01:11:55,064
[SPEAKER_06]: You want to see me just get so sick?

987
01:11:55,285 --> 01:11:56,606
[SPEAKER_06]: Dan had to play through Portal for me.

988
01:11:57,287 --> 01:11:58,168
[SPEAKER_06]: I would tell him what to do.

989
01:11:58,188 --> 01:11:59,008
[SPEAKER_09]: So that he could look away?

990
01:11:59,829 --> 01:12:07,577
[SPEAKER_06]: I would tell him how to pass... Because I could easily see how to pass all of the puzzles and everything.

991
01:12:08,017 --> 01:12:13,202
[SPEAKER_06]: But I would literally have to tell him because the moment that I held the controller in my hand and actually looked at the screen to do it...

992
01:12:13,963 --> 01:12:14,544
[SPEAKER_06]: I would be sick.

993
01:12:14,584 --> 01:12:15,366
[SPEAKER_06]: Katamari does it.

994
01:12:15,566 --> 01:12:16,848
[SPEAKER_06]: Katamari makes me really sick.

995
01:12:17,329 --> 01:12:20,334
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't play more than two levels before I get way too ill to keep playing.

996
01:12:20,535 --> 01:12:21,075
[SPEAKER_09]: That sucks.

997
01:12:21,837 --> 01:12:24,822
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, well, hopefully they'll come out with an app for that.

998
01:12:24,842 --> 01:12:25,904
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't do it on my iPhone.

999
01:12:27,926 --> 01:12:28,406
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, iPhone's so tiny.

1000
01:12:28,466 --> 01:12:29,507
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't get that sick on my iPhone.

1001
01:12:29,547 --> 01:12:30,708
[SPEAKER_09]: You probably don't get as immersed there.

1002
01:12:31,990 --> 01:12:33,871
[SPEAKER_09]: SSJ100MAT does confirm it's Saul Bass.

1003
01:12:34,131 --> 01:12:35,052
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1004
01:12:35,152 --> 01:12:37,314
[SPEAKER_06]: I knew it was Saul Bass.

1005
01:12:37,394 --> 01:12:44,221
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, for anyone who ever wanted to know, I don't know if you do, but Saul Bass is one of my designer heroes.

1006
01:12:44,581 --> 01:12:48,665
[SPEAKER_06]: So, just go watch the opening credits for The Man with the Golden Arm and you'll know.

1007
01:12:49,827 --> 01:12:50,087
[SPEAKER_09]: Stay tuned!

1008
01:13:22,912 --> 01:13:23,352
[SPEAKER_09]: Orange Lounge Radio

1009
01:13:45,663 --> 01:13:49,504
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, that Paul Van Dyke track, the one we played, absolutely awesome.

1010
01:13:49,524 --> 01:13:53,044
[SPEAKER_08]: They had a demo online, or like a little clip online, their YouTube channel.

1011
01:13:53,825 --> 01:13:57,125
[SPEAKER_08]: I just love that song, and I couldn't wait to play it, and it's really hard.

1012
01:13:57,825 --> 01:14:01,546
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, that was a... It has a lot of cross-fading in there, and it's really hard.

1013
01:14:01,946 --> 01:14:09,747
[SPEAKER_09]: I was actually able to listen on the iPhone app for all games, which, by the way, if you own an iPhone and you don't have this app, it's awesome.

1014
01:14:10,108 --> 01:14:12,568
[SPEAKER_09]: You should check it out at allgames.com.

1015
01:14:12,928 --> 01:14:13,428
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura.com

1016
01:14:48,922 --> 01:14:51,003
[SPEAKER_09]: We have breaking news developing right now.

1017
01:14:51,244 --> 01:14:59,469
[SPEAKER_09]: The folks at Reno Wii, the President Cat game that we were laughing hysterically at in Part A, they have responded on their Twitter.

1018
01:14:59,930 --> 01:15:01,031
[SPEAKER_09]: And boy, have they ever.

1019
01:15:01,551 --> 01:15:04,313
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think they know what the hell is going on right now.

1020
01:15:04,733 --> 01:15:10,397
[SPEAKER_09]: They responded to one of our listeners, Technicolor, who tweeted our message that said, please release this game in the USA.

1021
01:15:10,817 --> 01:15:11,538
[SPEAKER_09]: They said, really?

1022
01:15:11,678 --> 01:15:12,419
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm so excited.

1023
01:15:12,499 --> 01:15:13,139
[SPEAKER_09]: Is this spam?

1024
01:15:13,519 --> 01:15:15,421
[SPEAKER_09]: So, A, we know they speak English.

1025
01:15:15,621 --> 01:15:18,523
[SPEAKER_09]: Even though they've been tweeting in Japanese, somebody over there speaks English.

1026
01:15:18,863 --> 01:15:21,605
[SPEAKER_09]: and then they tweeted to us and some other listeners, can I ask one question?

1027
01:15:21,645 --> 01:15:22,686
[SPEAKER_09]: How do you know this game?

1028
01:15:23,247 --> 01:15:26,189
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think somebody said back to them that they were hearing it here on Orange Launch Radio.

1029
01:15:26,229 --> 01:15:28,050
[SPEAKER_09]: They tweeted back, oh my goodness, really?

1030
01:15:28,411 --> 01:15:29,291
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you so much.

1031
01:15:29,631 --> 01:15:31,713
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm talking about this with coworkers right now.

1032
01:15:31,753 --> 01:15:32,714
[SPEAKER_09]: They are all excited.

1033
01:15:33,895 --> 01:15:36,917
[SPEAKER_09]: If this information on some website, let me know the URL.

1034
01:15:36,977 --> 01:15:37,838
[SPEAKER_09]: Please retweet.

1035
01:15:37,878 --> 01:15:40,160
[SPEAKER_09]: And they've been corresponding with one of our listeners on Twitter.

1036
01:15:40,280 --> 01:15:41,961
[SPEAKER_09]: Edmund Liu, I guess, has been helping them out.

1037
01:15:42,621 --> 01:15:42,742
[SPEAKER_09]: And...

1038
01:15:44,474 --> 01:15:50,456
[SPEAKER_09]: They told them that we were getting it from PlayAsia.com, the release dates, which is where I read the Japanese release dates from.

1039
01:15:51,056 --> 01:15:53,557
[SPEAKER_09]: And they responded, thank you so much.

1040
01:15:54,277 --> 01:15:56,558
[SPEAKER_09]: And they retweeted so that all their followers could see it.

1041
01:15:56,638 --> 01:16:00,239
[SPEAKER_09]: OLR talked about it on their radio show, and it really looks like an interesting game to play.

1042
01:16:00,900 --> 01:16:03,620
[SPEAKER_09]: And then they said, thanks, is this popular in the USA?

1043
01:16:03,700 --> 01:16:04,741
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry for many questions.

1044
01:16:05,061 --> 01:16:10,243
[SPEAKER_09]: So in the scope of just that time that Loki was playing DJ Hero during the break, they've tweeted six times about this...

1045
01:16:11,463 --> 01:16:39,303
[SPEAKER_09]: President Cat takes over the USA tonight live on Orange Lounge Radio thing going on I also replied to that last thing saying that that yeah some gamers like that kind of thing stuff other than the sports and the typical RPG and that I personally love those kinds of games oh and oh they just less than a minute ago they have responded to one of my tweets because I wrote them back saying we found it on our weekly Japanese release date reading and think we need more low cat inspired games how can we help get game in USA and

1046
01:16:39,551 --> 01:16:39,911
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura.com

1047
01:17:04,993 --> 01:17:06,694
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry for the dead air, so I'm tweeting back right now.

1048
01:17:06,794 --> 01:17:11,116
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, game in English and playable on our American Wiis.

1049
01:17:11,336 --> 01:17:13,877
[SPEAKER_09]: The chat room is shouting, get them on the show, get them on the show.

1050
01:17:14,977 --> 01:17:18,118
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know if Japan can call our 800 numbers.

1051
01:17:18,139 --> 01:17:20,980
[SPEAKER_06]: I have a friend that lives in Japan.

1052
01:17:22,202 --> 01:17:24,503
[SPEAKER_06]: Who is currently, you know Julie?

1053
01:17:25,083 --> 01:17:25,323
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1054
01:17:25,423 --> 01:17:26,623
[SPEAKER_06]: Julie is in Japan right now.

1055
01:17:27,203 --> 01:17:28,304
[SPEAKER_06]: Julie is with Krista.

1056
01:17:28,724 --> 01:17:30,224
[SPEAKER_06]: Krista speaks fluent Japanese.

1057
01:17:30,324 --> 01:17:33,205
[SPEAKER_09]: I wonder if we can get them on Skype or something.

1058
01:17:33,305 --> 01:17:33,585
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

1059
01:17:33,625 --> 01:17:34,025
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll tell them.

1060
01:17:34,365 --> 01:17:36,306
[SPEAKER_09]: They added us back so I can direct message them.

1061
01:17:36,326 --> 01:17:37,526
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'll tell them to email me.

1062
01:17:37,566 --> 01:17:39,986
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't want to do anything tonight because it's all panning out too fast.

1063
01:17:40,326 --> 01:17:41,787
[SPEAKER_09]: But we'll try to get them on a future show.

1064
01:17:41,967 --> 01:17:43,587
[SPEAKER_09]: I am going to love this.

1065
01:17:44,167 --> 01:17:45,628
[SPEAKER_09]: AlphaKananaGram in chat says...

1066
01:17:46,789 --> 01:17:48,950
[SPEAKER_09]: This is one kick-ass episode of OLR.

1067
01:17:49,410 --> 01:17:50,251
[SPEAKER_08]: Let me put it this way, okay?

1068
01:17:50,791 --> 01:17:57,955
[SPEAKER_08]: There's many companies out there like Tomo, well, not necessarily Tomo, but was it UFO Interactive Games and stuff like that?

1069
01:17:57,995 --> 01:18:00,336
[SPEAKER_08]: They port really obscure shit.

1070
01:18:00,756 --> 01:18:03,397
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, just really obscure Japanese RPGs.

1071
01:18:03,857 --> 01:18:09,120
[SPEAKER_08]: Or not even Japanese RPGs, like Japanese shooters and just weird games for budget prices.

1072
01:18:09,780 --> 01:18:11,721
[SPEAKER_08]: One of these companies could easily pick this game up.

1073
01:18:12,042 --> 01:18:14,723
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just whether they think they can actually sell some copies of it.

1074
01:18:15,183 --> 01:18:16,263
[SPEAKER_08]: They just tweeted it again.

1075
01:18:16,383 --> 01:18:19,504
[SPEAKER_09]: And keep in mind, it's like noon in Japan on a Monday morning right now, right?

1076
01:18:19,524 --> 01:18:21,024
[SPEAKER_09]: Because they're across on the other side of the dateline.

1077
01:18:21,044 --> 01:18:22,144
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's probably about noon right there.

1078
01:18:22,544 --> 01:18:24,865
[SPEAKER_09]: And they just tweeted again, great people, awesome.

1079
01:18:24,885 --> 01:18:28,165
[SPEAKER_09]: And they put, at OLR, there are many piano-playing, cat-loving people.

1080
01:18:28,245 --> 01:18:29,526
[SPEAKER_09]: Because that's what I said to them.

1081
01:18:32,026 --> 01:18:32,986
[SPEAKER_09]: So this is amazing.

1082
01:18:33,086 --> 01:18:34,826
[SPEAKER_09]: So we're going to correspond with them.

1083
01:18:34,846 --> 01:18:41,168
[SPEAKER_08]: If they could do a viral advertisement or whatever with Keyboard Cat, I think they could have something.

1084
01:18:41,188 --> 01:18:43,968
[SPEAKER_08]: It could get the whole mame-loving people involved.

1085
01:18:44,619 --> 01:18:46,100
[SPEAKER_08]: Especially if the price is right, you know?

1086
01:18:46,120 --> 01:18:48,963
[SPEAKER_09]: Let me see if she's online.

1087
01:18:49,003 --> 01:18:49,143
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyhow.

1088
01:19:10,771 --> 01:19:11,892
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyhow, I don't know what we have to do.

1089
01:19:11,912 --> 01:19:14,313
[SPEAKER_09]: If we're going to have to do one of those silly online petitions or what.

1090
01:19:14,373 --> 01:19:15,975
[SPEAKER_09]: But meanwhile, we have a show to do.

1091
01:19:16,375 --> 01:19:17,556
[SPEAKER_09]: We've got to get to Twitter topics.

1092
01:19:18,436 --> 01:19:18,796
[SPEAKER_09]: Here's the thing.

1093
01:19:18,876 --> 01:19:23,500
[SPEAKER_09]: I am not prepared for Twitter topics because usually I can just click on the at OLR messages and they're all right there.

1094
01:19:23,560 --> 01:19:26,562
[SPEAKER_09]: But tonight, because of President Cat, our Twitter is full.

1095
01:19:26,662 --> 01:19:27,642
[SPEAKER_09]: So I need to go back a little bit.

1096
01:19:27,882 --> 01:19:29,484
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to mix things up a little.

1097
01:19:29,824 --> 01:19:30,164
[SPEAKER_09]: Why not?

1098
01:19:30,244 --> 01:19:30,744
[SPEAKER_09]: It's one of those nights.

1099
01:19:30,764 --> 01:19:34,827
[SPEAKER_08]: I think we should put a post on the front page about bring President Cat to the U.S.

1100
01:19:35,508 --> 01:19:37,329
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, that would be awesome.

1101
01:19:37,569 --> 01:19:38,329
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll figure something out.

1102
01:19:38,730 --> 01:19:39,190
[SPEAKER_08]: Absolutely.

1103
01:19:41,892 --> 01:19:43,814
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe we can get some of our friends at GameBallers involved.

1104
01:19:43,894 --> 01:19:44,555
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know what we can do.

1105
01:19:44,615 --> 01:19:45,255
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll figure it out.

1106
01:19:46,036 --> 01:19:49,780
[SPEAKER_09]: All I know is that all unfolding live here on Sunday night might be a bit much.

1107
01:19:50,260 --> 01:19:52,763
[SPEAKER_09]: So we're going to get into some Twitter topics.

1108
01:19:52,783 --> 01:19:53,083
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sorry.

1109
01:19:53,864 --> 01:19:54,444
[SPEAKER_09]: Fast news.

1110
01:19:54,985 --> 01:19:57,147
[SPEAKER_09]: Loki's going to cover some quick news stories for us.

1111
01:19:57,467 --> 01:19:57,648
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

1112
01:19:58,788 --> 01:20:10,512
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, so Final Fantasy XI, the Ultimate Collection, not the first collection that they've released on PC, but probably the last, will be coming out, of course, for $20 soon.

1113
01:20:11,012 --> 01:20:12,693
[SPEAKER_08]: November 10th is the date that's coming out.

1114
01:20:13,573 --> 01:20:15,514
[SPEAKER_08]: And actually, that will be coming out on 360 as well.

1115
01:20:16,554 --> 01:20:18,455
[SPEAKER_08]: And as you might expect, it's basically...

1116
01:20:19,485 --> 01:20:21,207
[SPEAKER_08]: Final Fantasy XIV Final Fantasy XIV

1117
01:20:36,443 --> 01:20:47,610
[SPEAKER_08]: Also, Zen Studios, the creators of such wonderful games like Zen Pinball, Pinball FX, and The Punisher No Mercy are releasing a brand new game to the PlayStation Network called Planet Minigolf.

1118
01:20:48,291 --> 01:20:59,137
[SPEAKER_08]: It is going to be a game featuring 144 minigolf holes with several exhilarating courses around the world, they say, complete with crazy obstacles and six customizable characters.

1119
01:20:59,998 --> 01:21:00,858
[SPEAKER_08]: And it looks pretty sweet.

1120
01:21:01,979 --> 01:21:03,520
[SPEAKER_08]: I love me some minigolf games.

1121
01:21:05,326 --> 01:21:14,712
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, finally, as rumored, um, Sony is releasing a 250 gigabyte PlayStation 3 Slim model over here in the US as well.

1122
01:21:15,152 --> 01:21:21,176
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, it is coming standalone, no packing games with that, and only for $50 more than the 120 gigabyte system.

1123
01:21:21,756 --> 01:21:24,958
[SPEAKER_08]: So, a $349.99 will be the price on that.

1124
01:21:25,398 --> 01:21:30,641
[SPEAKER_08]: Which is not a bad deal if you're looking to really pack a lot of crap onto your PlayStation 3 hard drive.

1125
01:21:31,502 --> 01:21:31,602
[SPEAKER_08]: Um...

1126
01:21:32,679 --> 01:21:34,826
[SPEAKER_08]: So that'll be coming out around November 3rd.

1127
01:21:37,481 --> 01:21:37,781
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1128
01:21:38,302 --> 01:21:39,783
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry, they wrote back again.

1129
01:21:40,563 --> 01:21:42,424
[SPEAKER_09]: I hate to keep going back to this, but I'm loving this.

1130
01:21:43,365 --> 01:21:44,766
[SPEAKER_09]: They're asking their boss right now.

1131
01:21:45,687 --> 01:21:47,248
[SPEAKER_09]: They put, wow, ask my boss.

1132
01:21:47,588 --> 01:21:48,669
[SPEAKER_09]: Ha ha, wait a minute, please.

1133
01:21:49,349 --> 01:21:53,372
[SPEAKER_09]: And retweeted our message about, yes, game in English and playable on our American Wiis.

1134
01:21:53,412 --> 01:21:54,432
[SPEAKER_09]: How can we help make this happen?

1135
01:21:54,973 --> 01:22:02,338
[SPEAKER_09]: So some executive at some Japanese game company right now is hearing about some crappy little internet show in America that wants this damn game.

1136
01:22:03,298 --> 01:22:04,739
[SPEAKER_06]: Dude, totally want President Cat.

1137
01:22:05,060 --> 01:22:05,580
[SPEAKER_09]: Amazing.

1138
01:22:06,160 --> 01:22:06,961
[SPEAKER_09]: I love the internet.

1139
01:22:07,432 --> 01:22:11,117
[SPEAKER_06]: And hey, you know, maybe if all else fails, they'll just send us a Japanese Wii game.

1140
01:22:11,137 --> 01:22:12,118
[SPEAKER_08]: Just put it on WiiWare.

1141
01:22:12,138 --> 01:22:14,341
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, honestly, it can't be that big of a game.

1142
01:22:14,401 --> 01:22:16,023
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, just put it on WiiWare.

1143
01:22:16,063 --> 01:22:16,924
[SPEAKER_02]: President Cat!

1144
01:22:17,024 --> 01:22:23,372
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, well, when Twitter ladies, bosses, or guys, I don't know who it is, but when that boss gets back to them, we will have more.

1145
01:22:23,852 --> 01:22:27,796
[SPEAKER_09]: Meantime, more late-breaking, well, not late-breaking, but rapid-fire news anyway.

1146
01:22:28,917 --> 01:22:30,398
[SPEAKER_09]: News about Super Mario Bros.

1147
01:22:30,478 --> 01:22:31,780
[SPEAKER_09]: Wii, the new one coming out.

1148
01:22:31,840 --> 01:22:34,162
[SPEAKER_09]: Did you know Princess Peach is not playable in the game?

1149
01:22:34,962 --> 01:22:38,366
[SPEAKER_09]: Actually, this was brought up recently in an interview with Miyamoto, and Miyamoto commented...

1150
01:22:38,786 --> 01:22:40,767
[SPEAKER_09]: Is that maybe a throwback to the fact that people in Super Smash Bros.

1151
01:22:40,787 --> 01:22:43,349
[SPEAKER_09]: Melee were just pausing the game to do upskirt cams on Princess Peach and Daisy?

1152
01:22:43,369 --> 01:22:43,689
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

1153
01:23:06,035 --> 01:23:09,577
[SPEAKER_09]: But regardless, it sounds like they're trying to skirt the issue.

1154
01:23:10,917 --> 01:23:12,698
[SPEAKER_09]: Mass Effect 2 now has a release date.

1155
01:23:12,738 --> 01:23:18,081
[SPEAKER_09]: It's coming out in North America on January 26th, and it's coming out in Europe on the 29th.

1156
01:23:18,781 --> 01:23:20,202
[SPEAKER_09]: Is there really anything else you need to know?

1157
01:23:20,442 --> 01:23:22,983
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, you might want to know about the GameStop pre-order bonus that they're offering.

1158
01:23:24,136 --> 01:23:25,817
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1159
01:23:46,734 --> 01:23:50,636
[SPEAKER_09]: Duels of the Planeswalker gets a new expansion on Xbox 360.

1160
01:23:51,276 --> 01:23:56,878
[SPEAKER_09]: They think the name is Duel of the Dragons, but it is being priced only 400 Microsoft points.

1161
01:23:57,279 --> 01:23:59,459
[SPEAKER_09]: It is coming out on the 21st of October.

1162
01:23:59,500 --> 01:24:05,002
[SPEAKER_09]: It's going to add three playable decks and three unlockable cards for all of the original decks.

1163
01:24:05,482 --> 01:24:10,804
[SPEAKER_09]: So there you go, some new expansions coming to Magic the Gathering, which hopefully you didn't forget was out there on the Wii.

1164
01:24:11,204 --> 01:24:11,585
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's do...

1165
01:24:14,042 --> 01:24:14,783
[SPEAKER_09]: Jamie's Stories.

1166
01:24:15,324 --> 01:24:17,007
[SPEAKER_04]: We never did our closed deck tournament, Rob.

1167
01:24:17,387 --> 01:24:17,948
[SPEAKER_09]: We never did.

1168
01:24:18,008 --> 01:24:18,469
[SPEAKER_09]: We need to.

1169
01:24:19,281 --> 01:24:24,986
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, how about some news about Alpha Protocol, which actually really isn't very much news because I think we expected it.

1170
01:24:25,946 --> 01:24:31,751
[SPEAKER_06]: It is delayed instead of being out, even for Christmas, they're pushing it back to spring 2010.

1171
01:24:32,632 --> 01:24:41,639
[SPEAKER_06]: But Obsidian, the developer, is actually pretty happy about that because it gives them more time to make sure it's really polished and looking the way that they want it to.

1172
01:24:41,739 --> 01:24:42,820
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think that's a good thing.

1173
01:24:43,621 --> 01:24:48,845
[SPEAKER_06]: I would rather wait for a good product than have to deal with substandard.

1174
01:24:50,053 --> 01:24:51,534
[SPEAKER_09]: Delays aren't always a bad thing.

1175
01:24:51,594 --> 01:24:53,695
[SPEAKER_09]: Delays can sometimes end out pretty good.

1176
01:24:54,815 --> 01:25:00,257
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, two characters for Tatsunoko vs. Capcom have been released.

1177
01:25:01,317 --> 01:25:06,519
[SPEAKER_06]: We have Condor Nojo as Joe the Condor from Gatchaman.

1178
01:25:06,560 --> 01:25:09,541
[SPEAKER_06]: He was G2, the one who always wanted to fire the bird missile.

1179
01:25:11,321 --> 01:25:14,303
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, just to say, for anyone who watched Battle of the Planets, it was Jason.

1180
01:25:14,323 --> 01:25:18,445
[SPEAKER_06]: It was Dirk in GeForce.

1181
01:25:18,645 --> 01:25:23,228
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, I'm the Gatchaman fangirl, so I'm very happy about this.

1182
01:25:23,948 --> 01:25:24,308
[SPEAKER_06]: And then...

1183
01:25:25,849 --> 01:25:27,090
[SPEAKER_06]: There's also Zero.

1184
01:25:27,350 --> 01:25:31,433
[SPEAKER_06]: Zero is going to be out, as in Zero from the Mega Man X series.

1185
01:25:32,374 --> 01:25:34,796
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's going to be pretty sweet.

1186
01:25:34,916 --> 01:25:41,861
[SPEAKER_06]: I actually watched videos of them in motion, and it was epic.

1187
01:25:42,161 --> 01:25:44,643
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, the team up with...

1188
01:25:46,879 --> 01:25:53,784
[SPEAKER_06]: They had a Joe and June on one of the matches I saw and they did the Tatsumaki attack.

1189
01:25:53,944 --> 01:25:54,644
[SPEAKER_06]: That was pretty cool.

1190
01:25:55,045 --> 01:25:56,125
[SPEAKER_06]: That was pretty damn cool.

1191
01:25:56,165 --> 01:25:57,586
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm looking so forward to this.

1192
01:25:58,187 --> 01:26:00,688
[SPEAKER_06]: Except I really don't like what they did with the Tatsunoko logo in English.

1193
01:26:01,689 --> 01:26:03,170
[SPEAKER_06]: It doesn't look nice.

1194
01:26:03,410 --> 01:26:06,032
[SPEAKER_06]: They should have just stuck to the Japanese one.

1195
01:26:07,492 --> 01:26:34,633
[SPEAKER_06]: and last but definitely not least Blur is going to be in Lego Rock Band and there are little Blur shaped Lego stick people all bricked out for Lego Rock Band so that makes me pretty happy I'm just sort of laughing at the little Damon and the little Graham I think that's pretty funny

1196
01:26:36,659 --> 01:26:37,320
[SPEAKER_06]: That's just cute.

1197
01:26:38,281 --> 01:26:38,661
[SPEAKER_06]: But that's it.

1198
01:26:40,883 --> 01:26:41,224
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1199
01:26:42,965 --> 01:26:44,827
[SPEAKER_09]: Moving on, we're going to get into some Twitter topics.

1200
01:26:44,867 --> 01:26:45,808
[SPEAKER_09]: You guys ready to do Twitter?

1201
01:26:46,009 --> 01:26:54,157
[SPEAKER_09]: I know we had a lot of Twitter tonight with what the developments with President Cat, which apparently they just posted some type of comic that has our chat room in stitches right now.

1202
01:26:55,400 --> 01:26:55,920
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, I see.

1203
01:26:56,160 --> 01:26:56,921
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm loving this.

1204
01:26:57,021 --> 01:26:59,241
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, live radio doesn't... I'm serious.

1205
01:26:59,301 --> 01:27:00,762
[SPEAKER_08]: We should petition this stuff.

1206
01:27:00,902 --> 01:27:01,902
[SPEAKER_08]: We should send it all out.

1207
01:27:02,002 --> 01:27:04,083
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, tell people why this game needs to come over here.

1208
01:27:05,664 --> 01:27:06,664
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, let's wait and see how they respond.

1209
01:27:06,704 --> 01:27:07,744
[SPEAKER_03]: I can actually read some of this.

1210
01:27:08,745 --> 01:27:08,985
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright.

1211
01:27:09,585 --> 01:27:09,865
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyhow.

1212
01:27:10,325 --> 01:27:10,666
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sorry.

1213
01:27:10,686 --> 01:27:13,807
[SPEAKER_09]: I didn't mean for President Cat to take over the show, but... Goddamn.

1214
01:27:13,827 --> 01:27:14,707
[SPEAKER_13]: This is cute!

1215
01:27:17,228 --> 01:27:19,028
[SPEAKER_09]: OLRZO, President Cat won.

1216
01:27:20,009 --> 01:27:20,789
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's just face it.

1217
01:27:21,549 --> 01:27:22,910
[SPEAKER_09]: President Cat is the fourth host tonight.

1218
01:27:23,459 --> 01:27:25,079
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, Twitter topics, dammit.

1219
01:27:25,559 --> 01:27:27,760
[SPEAKER_09]: Things that don't involve President Cat, believe it or not.

1220
01:27:28,460 --> 01:27:31,201
[SPEAKER_09]: Questions when our tweeters give us stuff at OLR.

1221
01:27:31,521 --> 01:27:35,601
[SPEAKER_09]: Deekman wants me to remind you all, you can now post pictures to the photo stream.

1222
01:27:36,682 --> 01:27:46,464
[SPEAKER_09]: So if you send a picture to pics at orangelaunchradio.com, it will now go to our website at www.orangelaunchradio.com and it'll be right up there for everyone to see.

1223
01:27:47,964 --> 01:28:14,478
[SPEAKER_09]: so don't send pictures of penises or I swear to God we'll remove this like that but if you have like gaming stuff you want to put or maybe it's a challenge this week to show our love for President Cat you need to upload pictures in fact we should give a challenge to the listeners every week I love this idea since President Cat has taken over the show tonight we want people to upload pictures to the stream showing their love for President Cat because this will help the developers show that they are the next big thing in the U.S.

1224
01:28:15,663 --> 01:28:16,604
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's make that happen.

1225
01:28:43,411 --> 01:28:45,051
[SPEAKER_09]: Other Twitter topics going on.

1226
01:28:46,052 --> 01:28:46,692
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, shoot.

1227
01:28:48,192 --> 01:28:49,872
[SPEAKER_09]: I somehow accidentally clicked on an ad.

1228
01:28:50,773 --> 01:28:51,793
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, man.

1229
01:28:52,873 --> 01:28:55,133
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

1230
01:28:55,254 --> 01:28:56,194
[SPEAKER_08]: Advertisement fail.

1231
01:28:57,514 --> 01:29:01,495
[SPEAKER_09]: Ryan Belknap wants to know, what do you guys think of Glee and Flash Forward?

1232
01:29:02,535 --> 01:29:03,355
[SPEAKER_09]: I love Glee.

1233
01:29:03,595 --> 01:29:04,735
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that show's amazing.

1234
01:29:05,616 --> 01:29:09,236
[SPEAKER_09]: Flash Forward, I watched the first episode but wasn't able to watch anything after that.

1235
01:29:09,556 --> 01:29:12,397
[SPEAKER_09]: I just haven't had time because I've been watching a bunch of other shows.

1236
01:29:12,677 --> 01:29:13,337
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks for watching!

1237
01:29:29,824 --> 01:29:32,845
[SPEAKER_08]: My wife is excited about the fact that they're going to be going on tour.

1238
01:29:33,745 --> 01:29:34,885
[SPEAKER_08]: So she wants to go see that.

1239
01:29:35,725 --> 01:29:36,865
[SPEAKER_08]: Did that get officially announced?

1240
01:29:37,365 --> 01:29:37,906
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

1241
01:29:38,206 --> 01:29:39,406
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to see it too if it goes on tour.

1242
01:29:39,426 --> 01:29:40,706
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll take your wife if you don't want to go.

1243
01:29:41,746 --> 01:29:46,007
[SPEAKER_08]: And then also, flash forward, I've actually watched.

1244
01:29:46,127 --> 01:29:48,048
[SPEAKER_08]: It's good, but it's slow.

1245
01:29:48,208 --> 01:29:49,108
[SPEAKER_08]: That's the only problem.

1246
01:29:49,148 --> 01:29:50,668
[SPEAKER_08]: But it is getting interesting.

1247
01:29:51,508 --> 01:29:52,628
[SPEAKER_08]: But it is very slow.

1248
01:29:53,109 --> 01:29:55,089
[SPEAKER_08]: I like Fringe better, but I watch them both.

1249
01:29:56,351 --> 01:29:57,252
[SPEAKER_09]: It's by the people who do the 4400.

1250
01:29:57,752 --> 01:29:59,133
[SPEAKER_08]: But you know what I haven't been watching, though?

1251
01:29:59,353 --> 01:30:00,955
[SPEAKER_08]: And I hear it's actually good this season.

1252
01:30:01,495 --> 01:30:01,875
[SPEAKER_08]: Heroes.

1253
01:30:02,996 --> 01:30:03,316
[SPEAKER_08]: Really?

1254
01:30:03,336 --> 01:30:04,477
[SPEAKER_08]: And I stopped watching it, too.

1255
01:30:05,038 --> 01:30:05,818
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I'm watching House.

1256
01:30:05,838 --> 01:30:06,919
[SPEAKER_09]: Because House is on at the same time.

1257
01:30:06,939 --> 01:30:07,259
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sorry.

1258
01:30:07,419 --> 01:30:07,920
[SPEAKER_09]: House wins.

1259
01:30:08,220 --> 01:30:12,083
[SPEAKER_09]: Can I say, though, I got introduced to It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia the other day.

1260
01:30:12,103 --> 01:30:12,603
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, my God.

1261
01:30:12,904 --> 01:30:14,505
[SPEAKER_09]: That show is fucking funny.

1262
01:30:14,725 --> 01:30:16,326
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, my God, that show is funny.

1263
01:30:16,987 --> 01:30:18,167
[SPEAKER_08]: I've really been kind of...

1264
01:30:19,068 --> 01:30:20,069
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for watching!

1265
01:30:40,566 --> 01:30:41,266
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1266
01:31:03,627 --> 01:31:10,771
[SPEAKER_09]: Spazinator wants to know, how about the apparent leak by Naughty Dog on the official PS boards regarding cross-game chat coming to the PS3 in firmware 3.1?

1267
01:31:11,872 --> 01:31:16,195
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, you kind of summed it up right there what the news story is, and all I have to say is I hope so.

1268
01:31:16,355 --> 01:31:24,139
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, sadly, as much as I've said nice things about Sony tonight, I think that they're still lagging big time in the online war.

1269
01:31:24,860 --> 01:31:28,602
[SPEAKER_09]: But they're free, so I guess you get what you pay for, but this would be nice.

1270
01:31:28,742 --> 01:31:29,683
[SPEAKER_09]: It's certainly a nice feature.

1271
01:31:29,843 --> 01:31:30,803
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, of course it would be.

1272
01:31:31,404 --> 01:31:31,544
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1273
01:31:33,170 --> 01:31:33,530
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's see.

1274
01:31:33,650 --> 01:31:36,411
[SPEAKER_09]: Gamer Girl asks, what's the most fun game you've ever played?

1275
01:31:36,732 --> 01:31:39,613
[SPEAKER_09]: Like so fun that when it's over you'd play it a million times no matter what.

1276
01:31:41,394 --> 01:31:41,934
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh my gosh.

1277
01:31:44,075 --> 01:31:46,556
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know if I want to go like 8-bit or like newer stuff.

1278
01:31:48,276 --> 01:31:50,337
[SPEAKER_09]: I can always play The Guardian Legends.

1279
01:31:50,357 --> 01:31:53,278
[SPEAKER_09]: You know I talk about that game very fondly on this show and I love that game.

1280
01:31:53,578 --> 01:31:54,599
[SPEAKER_09]: I can always go back to that.

1281
01:31:54,879 --> 01:31:57,740
[SPEAKER_09]: If you want to go to a true 80s arcade classic, Dig Dug.

1282
01:31:57,960 --> 01:31:59,321
[SPEAKER_09]: I can never stop playing Dig Dug.

1283
01:31:59,561 --> 01:31:59,801
[SPEAKER_09]: Peggle.

1284
01:32:00,506 --> 01:32:04,328
[SPEAKER_06]: Redertainment asks, I have a big pile of strategy guides I want to get rid of.

1285
01:32:04,388 --> 01:32:05,008
[SPEAKER_06]: Suggestions?

1286
01:32:26,880 --> 01:32:33,403
[SPEAKER_06]: If you have the versus Final Fantasy 7 one and it still has the poster in it and it's intact, give it to me.

1287
01:32:34,484 --> 01:32:35,444
[SPEAKER_08]: Also, winter is coming.

1288
01:32:35,464 --> 01:32:36,585
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I don't want to pay $100 for it on eBay.

1289
01:32:37,748 --> 01:32:42,130
[SPEAKER_08]: I had that poster, but my drunk girlfriend kicked it and it accidentally ripped.

1290
01:32:43,210 --> 01:32:48,913
[SPEAKER_06]: I had the strategy guide and the poster and everything, and Dan's friend ripped the cover and drew on it.

1291
01:32:49,253 --> 01:32:50,013
[SPEAKER_08]: It was a long time ago.

1292
01:32:50,573 --> 01:32:51,133
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm pissed off.

1293
01:32:51,233 --> 01:32:54,295
[SPEAKER_06]: That particular strategy guide goes for a lot of money on eBay.

1294
01:32:54,795 --> 01:32:55,355
[SPEAKER_06]: Seriously.

1295
01:32:56,055 --> 01:32:57,796
[SPEAKER_06]: The versus books Final Fantasy VII one.

1296
01:32:58,336 --> 01:32:59,697
[SPEAKER_09]: Reno, we just responded to you, Jamie.

1297
01:33:00,180 --> 01:33:00,680
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, Lord.

1298
01:33:01,741 --> 01:33:02,902
[SPEAKER_09]: She's busy tonight.

1299
01:33:03,002 --> 01:33:03,322
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry.

1300
01:33:04,542 --> 01:33:05,783
[SPEAKER_09]: It's taking over Twitter tonight.

1301
01:33:05,903 --> 01:33:07,404
[SPEAKER_09]: I just, I can't help it.

1302
01:33:07,704 --> 01:33:09,685
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway, that's going to do it for Twitter topics tonight.

1303
01:33:09,725 --> 01:33:10,706
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry if you guys didn't get through.

1304
01:33:11,346 --> 01:33:14,548
[SPEAKER_09]: Don't forget, you can always send us an email, mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com.

1305
01:33:15,048 --> 01:33:21,432
[SPEAKER_09]: And if you're really upset your tweet didn't get through, blame President Cat, because that's been monopolizing our Twitter discussion this evening.

1306
01:33:21,712 --> 01:33:22,372
[SPEAKER_09]: But I love it.

1307
01:33:22,752 --> 01:33:24,974
[SPEAKER_08]: It's got a cat licking its nose.

1308
01:33:25,034 --> 01:33:26,154
[SPEAKER_08]: It's so cute.

1309
01:33:26,254 --> 01:33:26,915
[SPEAKER_08]: Exactly.

1310
01:33:28,151 --> 01:33:30,513
[SPEAKER_09]: How about some other gaming news, Loki?

1311
01:33:31,814 --> 01:33:33,596
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know if I could do any more gaming news.

1312
01:33:33,676 --> 01:33:36,819
[SPEAKER_08]: It just feels so insignificant compared to President Cat.

1313
01:33:37,579 --> 01:33:38,980
[SPEAKER_08]: But anyways, we'll move on.

1314
01:33:40,262 --> 01:33:46,107
[SPEAKER_08]: So apparently people are getting banned for playing pirated copies of Forza and Borderlands.

1315
01:33:46,667 --> 01:33:46,987
[SPEAKER_08]: Really?! !

1316
01:33:47,881 --> 01:33:49,602
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that a shock to you?

1317
01:33:49,682 --> 01:33:55,423
[SPEAKER_08]: That, you know, playing games that you've burned early is gonna get you banned off Xbox Live?

1318
01:33:55,463 --> 01:33:56,184
[SPEAKER_08]: But yeah, that's the case.

1319
01:33:56,624 --> 01:34:03,186
[SPEAKER_08]: So, apparently, if you are gonna go the illegal route with Forza Motorsports 3 and Borderlands, you might wanna wait until the game comes out.

1320
01:34:03,806 --> 01:34:05,246
[SPEAKER_08]: But, um, yeah.

1321
01:34:05,526 --> 01:34:14,469
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's, ironically, though, you're gonna get banned, but only your live account's gonna get banned, not your console, because they still want you to buy games, apparently.

1322
01:34:14,729 --> 01:34:16,610
[SPEAKER_08]: But, um, you can always create a new live account.

1323
01:34:17,586 --> 01:34:20,388
[SPEAKER_08]: Or if you're really going to play this that early, just play it offline.

1324
01:34:21,729 --> 01:34:23,190
[SPEAKER_08]: Or play it on a banned console.

1325
01:34:24,611 --> 01:34:28,673
[SPEAKER_09]: I heard, though, they only ban the console... Or no, they ban the account and not the console.

1326
01:34:28,954 --> 01:34:30,274
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, the account.

1327
01:34:30,294 --> 01:34:33,617
[SPEAKER_08]: In some way, they knew whether you're playing a legit game or not.

1328
01:34:34,057 --> 01:34:41,622
[SPEAKER_08]: I almost picked up Borderlands early, too, but I figured I wouldn't get to it because I'd be playing DJ Hero, and that's really what's going to happen.

1329
01:34:41,662 --> 01:34:45,444
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to wait for Borderlands to come out because I don't know when I'm going to get to it.

1330
01:34:45,865 --> 01:34:46,025
[SPEAKER_08]: And...

1331
01:34:47,352 --> 01:34:48,213
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1332
01:35:14,889 --> 01:35:16,670
[SPEAKER_08]: I hope none of my consoles get banned.

1333
01:35:16,770 --> 01:35:17,350
[SPEAKER_09]: Interesting.

1334
01:35:17,631 --> 01:35:24,795
[SPEAKER_08]: Of course, ironically enough, this is kind of off topic, but since I have modded consoles, I'll go ahead and talk about it.

1335
01:35:25,535 --> 01:35:30,098
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not even really the fact that they're modded, it's the fact that they're older generation consoles.

1336
01:35:30,418 --> 01:35:37,122
[SPEAKER_08]: I've had a 100% failure rate with Xbox 360s, the first generation of them.

1337
01:35:37,663 --> 01:35:38,083
[SPEAKER_08]: I've had

1338
01:35:39,258 --> 01:36:07,818
[SPEAKER_08]: and I have another one that's dead or that's gonna die it's freezing up now and it was actually one that Microsoft repaired of course I went and modded it so now they can't repair it again but anything that like the new arcade systems you know when they have the HDMI ports and stuff on them I can actually those live sort of it's just the older ones do not my sister's console which I actually have a new one coming for her

1339
01:36:09,773 --> 01:36:11,113
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks for watching!

1340
01:36:32,286 --> 01:36:35,167
[SPEAKER_08]: And you know, their console's good, and I will buy another one.

1341
01:36:36,048 --> 01:36:36,528
[SPEAKER_08]: Of course you will.

1342
01:36:36,548 --> 01:36:37,528
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I'm a sucker like that.

1343
01:36:38,108 --> 01:36:40,649
[SPEAKER_08]: Because Grand Theft Auto 4 is awesome, and I have to mod it.

1344
01:36:42,170 --> 01:36:44,431
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, now, I'd be curious to know if Loki's going to buy this.

1345
01:36:44,551 --> 01:36:49,453
[SPEAKER_09]: It's something for the Wii that has nothing to do with President Cat, but it does have to do with an exercise bike.

1346
01:36:49,813 --> 01:36:54,655
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, I seem to remember on the show a couple weeks ago, we were talking about some type of patent for an exercise bike.

1347
01:36:54,875 --> 01:36:55,535
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, it wasn't a patent.

1348
01:36:55,555 --> 01:36:56,256
[SPEAKER_08]: It was a leaked...

1349
01:36:59,317 --> 01:37:04,219
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, it looks like this has come to fruition because Cyber Bike Cycling Sports is coming out.

1350
01:37:04,259 --> 01:37:04,719
[SPEAKER_09]: But here's the thing.

1351
01:37:04,759 --> 01:37:06,440
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not from Nintendo.

1352
01:37:06,880 --> 01:37:08,681
[SPEAKER_09]: It's coming from publisher Big Ben.

1353
01:37:09,041 --> 01:37:12,583
[SPEAKER_09]: And it comes with a, yes, full-size exercise bike controller.

1354
01:37:13,123 --> 01:37:14,884
[SPEAKER_09]: And apparently it's very easy to set up.

1355
01:37:14,904 --> 01:37:16,104
[SPEAKER_09]: It has an adjustable saddle.

1356
01:37:16,124 --> 01:37:17,885
[SPEAKER_09]: It has handlebars and all this.

1357
01:37:18,345 --> 01:37:20,606
[SPEAKER_09]: It's also compatible with Mario Kart Wii.

1358
01:37:21,067 --> 01:37:21,567
[SPEAKER_09]: Go figure.

1359
01:37:21,607 --> 01:37:23,988
[SPEAKER_09]: But the game that comes with it is called Cyber Bike.

1360
01:37:24,428 --> 01:37:25,388
[SPEAKER_09]: It's supposed to come out in 2010.

1361
01:37:27,577 --> 01:37:28,378
[SPEAKER_08]: It looks stupid.

1362
01:37:29,238 --> 01:37:29,539
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

1363
01:37:30,319 --> 01:37:34,843
[SPEAKER_08]: The other one, which looked pretty ridiculous to begin with, had a smaller peripheral.

1364
01:37:35,483 --> 01:37:38,846
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I could understand maybe having that because that's a little bit smaller.

1365
01:37:39,486 --> 01:37:43,750
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe there's some games that might use it later on, but this is a full fucking exercise bike.

1366
01:37:43,790 --> 01:37:46,892
[SPEAKER_08]: You do not need an exercise bike to go with the damn game.

1367
01:37:46,932 --> 01:37:50,135
[SPEAKER_08]: Just buy an exercise bike if you're going to buy an exercise bike.

1368
01:37:53,137 --> 01:37:53,437
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright.

1369
01:37:53,858 --> 01:37:53,978
[SPEAKER_09]: Um...

1370
01:37:56,024 --> 01:37:57,884
[SPEAKER_09]: Moving on, DarkSakura.

1371
01:37:59,505 --> 01:37:59,825
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yes.

1372
01:38:00,525 --> 01:38:00,865
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry.

1373
01:38:00,925 --> 01:38:02,066
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm still... No, I know.

1374
01:38:02,126 --> 01:38:04,046
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm so distracted with the Rina Wee thing, too.

1375
01:38:04,106 --> 01:38:05,987
[SPEAKER_09]: They said something again to you.

1376
01:38:06,107 --> 01:38:06,387
[SPEAKER_09]: To me?

1377
01:38:06,767 --> 01:38:07,147
[SPEAKER_09]: I see.

1378
01:38:07,287 --> 01:38:08,267
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm a little confused now.

1379
01:38:08,307 --> 01:38:09,528
[SPEAKER_09]: Many follower in English.

1380
01:38:09,768 --> 01:38:11,288
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, oh, grr, my poor English.

1381
01:38:11,988 --> 01:38:18,190
[SPEAKER_09]: I almost feel bad because they've got to be overwhelmed right now because their Twitter only had like 80 followers, which is fucking criminal.

1382
01:38:18,530 --> 01:38:18,790
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1383
01:38:19,290 --> 01:38:25,432
[SPEAKER_09]: and they've already got like 20 new followers throughout the show tonight and it's probably going to continue to grow as people listen to this podcast.

1384
01:38:26,153 --> 01:38:28,354
[SPEAKER_09]: Please go follow them.

1385
01:38:28,674 --> 01:38:32,595
[SPEAKER_09]: They are feeling like probably a little overwhelmed at this whole thing but people need to know.

1386
01:38:32,775 --> 01:38:33,916
[SPEAKER_09]: Cats are adorable, damn it.

1387
01:38:34,036 --> 01:38:34,396
[SPEAKER_09]: I know.

1388
01:38:34,596 --> 01:38:35,817
[SPEAKER_08]: So if we're distracted tonight, sorry.

1389
01:38:35,837 --> 01:38:36,297
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sorry.

1390
01:38:36,817 --> 01:38:43,560
[SPEAKER_08]: If Keyboard Cat can be as popular as it is, if Keyboard Cat can get referenced in Scribblenauts, there is no reason.

1391
01:38:43,660 --> 01:38:46,781
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, if they can put out all these stupid party games that don't sell...

1392
01:38:47,603 --> 01:38:48,183
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks for watching!

1393
01:39:13,246 --> 01:39:19,228
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, SJ100Matt in chat speaking of the last story says, wait, Mr. Garrison's wild wacky action bike, the game?

1394
01:39:20,929 --> 01:39:25,390
[SPEAKER_09]: No, it's not that kind of peripheral, but I bet with a little duct tape you can achieve anything.

1395
01:39:26,731 --> 01:39:27,151
[SPEAKER_08]: If you want.

1396
01:39:27,671 --> 01:39:32,633
[SPEAKER_08]: Question is, Rob, how quick before someone tries to put their penis in it?

1397
01:39:34,670 --> 01:39:37,172
[SPEAKER_09]: That is always a quintessential question here on Orange Lounge Radio.

1398
01:39:37,452 --> 01:39:39,554
[SPEAKER_09]: How quick before someone tries to put their penis in it?

1399
01:39:40,055 --> 01:39:42,236
[SPEAKER_09]: In the exercise bike, not long.

1400
01:39:42,357 --> 01:39:48,262
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, I don't know really where you would put your penis, but I'm sure somewhere it'll happen.

1401
01:39:49,903 --> 01:39:50,423
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, anyhow.

1402
01:39:51,084 --> 01:39:52,465
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry, DarkSakura, we keep interrupting.

1403
01:39:52,485 --> 01:39:56,048
[SPEAKER_09]: I know you're trying to correspond with Rina Wee, but there is a show still to be done.

1404
01:39:56,068 --> 01:39:57,750
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just saying, thank you for being patient with us.

1405
01:39:57,790 --> 01:39:58,911
[SPEAKER_06]: I wish I knew better Japanese.

1406
01:40:01,301 --> 01:40:03,301
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, back to Nintendo.

1407
01:40:05,162 --> 01:40:19,784
[SPEAKER_06]: Miyamoto has actually brought back a little bit more conversation in regards to HD Wii by saying that they want to support new technology as it comes out.

1408
01:40:21,125 --> 01:40:27,226
[SPEAKER_06]: And he's actually even saying that if he was a consumer that had an HD TV, he'd want to play his games with nice graphics too.

1409
01:40:28,226 --> 01:40:28,326
[SPEAKER_06]: Um...

1410
01:40:29,566 --> 01:40:37,054
[SPEAKER_06]: So they're actually going to be moving with it as HD technology becomes more and more prevalent, which really it is.

1411
01:40:37,294 --> 01:40:38,776
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, you know what I mean?

1412
01:40:43,801 --> 01:40:46,924
[SPEAKER_06]: But they are pretty...

1413
01:40:48,749 --> 01:40:54,515
[SPEAKER_06]: Adamant that they're going to focus on gameplay but not close the door on HD.

1414
01:40:54,635 --> 01:41:03,923
[SPEAKER_06]: In fact, there's actually some financial analysts already that are saying that it's definitely going to happen this summer.

1415
01:41:04,864 --> 01:41:11,811
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think that it's... I don't really know how they're going to do it other than add-ons, but...

1416
01:41:13,311 --> 01:41:19,776
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I think, you know, we've been saying on the show for some time, the Super Wii or the Wii HD that will be backwards compatible with the original Wii.

1417
01:41:19,796 --> 01:41:21,337
[SPEAKER_05]: The Wii Double D. Yeah.

1418
01:41:22,598 --> 01:41:26,962
[SPEAKER_09]: The Wii with four eyes or something will, is inevitable.

1419
01:41:27,122 --> 01:41:28,423
[SPEAKER_09]: It's going to happen.

1420
01:41:28,743 --> 01:41:35,288
[SPEAKER_09]: I think the question is when, and certainly, you know, summer 2010, I don't need a mega expensive analyst to tell me that.

1421
01:41:35,388 --> 01:41:38,671
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, I think I said that on the show months ago, that it's probably going to happen.

1422
01:41:38,691 --> 01:41:42,794
[SPEAKER_09]: Of course, I also called it for this year, so I'm not always right, but this is why I do the show for free.

1423
01:41:43,817 --> 01:41:44,617
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't want another Wii HD.

1424
01:41:44,657 --> 01:41:46,298
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm finding my Wii right now.

1425
01:41:46,318 --> 01:41:49,139
[SPEAKER_09]: Is that just because you don't want to spend more money, or what's the deal?

1426
01:42:10,183 --> 01:42:11,384
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I don't think money is an option.

1427
01:42:12,264 --> 01:42:17,006
[SPEAKER_08]: The problem is I'm so jaded by what they've done so far at the Wii.

1428
01:42:17,346 --> 01:42:19,827
[SPEAKER_08]: Why do I really want to go through the gamble again?

1429
01:42:19,967 --> 01:42:22,088
[SPEAKER_08]: Because tonight we have seen its potential.

1430
01:42:22,268 --> 01:42:24,689
[SPEAKER_08]: Listen, okay, I am checking my bank account.

1431
01:42:26,010 --> 01:42:27,271
[SPEAKER_08]: Why am I checking my bank account?

1432
01:42:27,571 --> 01:42:29,251
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I am buying President Cat.

1433
01:42:30,632 --> 01:42:31,993
[SPEAKER_08]: This purchase is imminent, okay?

1434
01:42:32,393 --> 01:42:32,933
[SPEAKER_09]: It's happening.

1435
01:42:32,953 --> 01:42:33,613
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm buying it too.

1436
01:42:33,793 --> 01:42:34,274
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm buying it too.

1437
01:42:34,574 --> 01:42:37,675
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't even have a thing that can play it, but I'm going to buy it.

1438
01:42:37,995 --> 01:42:38,255
[SPEAKER_09]: Why?

1439
01:42:38,816 --> 01:42:39,116
[SPEAKER_09]: Because...

1440
01:42:40,387 --> 01:42:41,208
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

1441
01:42:41,248 --> 01:42:42,009
[SPEAKER_09]: Don't fucking judge me.

1442
01:42:42,049 --> 01:42:42,610
[SPEAKER_09]: I just want it.

1443
01:42:43,611 --> 01:42:45,653
[SPEAKER_09]: I will look at the manual and purr at it or something.

1444
01:42:45,753 --> 01:42:46,234
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

1445
01:42:46,414 --> 01:42:48,096
[SPEAKER_09]: Someday my Wii will play it.

1446
01:42:48,136 --> 01:42:50,418
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to pay for my massage for me?

1447
01:42:50,679 --> 01:42:51,700
[SPEAKER_02]: Get me President Cat.

1448
01:42:53,288 --> 01:42:57,229
[SPEAKER_09]: Plus, I oddly want to support this.

1449
01:42:57,409 --> 01:42:58,329
[SPEAKER_09]: I do too.

1450
01:42:58,449 --> 01:42:59,790
[SPEAKER_09]: I hope the game doesn't stink.

1451
01:42:59,870 --> 01:43:00,270
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah.

1452
01:43:00,590 --> 01:43:01,150
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't care.

1453
01:43:01,170 --> 01:43:03,031
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't care if it stinks or not.

1454
01:43:03,111 --> 01:43:07,472
[SPEAKER_06]: The whole fun is going to be the whole novelty.

1455
01:43:08,332 --> 01:43:13,294
[SPEAKER_06]: Keep in mind, it's taken me a long time to actually sit and read the blog.

1456
01:43:13,854 --> 01:43:15,314
[SPEAKER_06]: Just the little comics of the cat.

1457
01:43:15,694 --> 01:43:16,835
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's freaking funny.

1458
01:43:17,295 --> 01:43:19,375
[SPEAKER_06]: Cat's like, why am I on your t-shirt?

1459
01:43:19,815 --> 01:43:20,636
[SPEAKER_06]: Pat, pat, pat.

1460
01:43:21,416 --> 01:43:21,736
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm like...

1461
01:43:22,576 --> 01:43:23,136
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1462
01:43:49,193 --> 01:43:49,553
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyhow.

1463
01:43:50,794 --> 01:43:51,394
[SPEAKER_09]: WeHD.

1464
01:43:51,794 --> 01:43:52,915
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it's going to happen.

1465
01:43:52,975 --> 01:43:55,136
[SPEAKER_09]: It'll be backwards compatible with all the Wii games.

1466
01:43:55,276 --> 01:43:56,356
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just a matter of when.

1467
01:43:56,676 --> 01:43:57,757
[SPEAKER_09]: We know it.

1468
01:43:58,257 --> 01:43:58,777
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a must.

1469
01:43:59,117 --> 01:44:01,599
[SPEAKER_06]: They replied and said, I wish I knew better English too.

1470
01:44:02,719 --> 01:44:02,879
[SPEAKER_09]: Aww.

1471
01:44:04,040 --> 01:44:05,040
[SPEAKER_09]: I just want to hug them.

1472
01:44:05,880 --> 01:44:07,401
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, I am supposed to go to Japan next year.

1473
01:44:07,441 --> 01:44:09,242
[SPEAKER_09]: I should offer to come give her a hug.

1474
01:44:09,402 --> 01:44:09,722
[SPEAKER_09]: Or him.

1475
01:44:09,962 --> 01:44:10,322
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't care.

1476
01:44:10,803 --> 01:44:11,743
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll hug them, whoever they are.

1477
01:44:12,904 --> 01:44:13,184
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyhow.

1478
01:44:14,004 --> 01:44:14,284
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki.

1479
01:44:15,064 --> 01:44:15,565
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, I'm sorry.

1480
01:44:16,085 --> 01:44:16,165
[SPEAKER_08]: Um.

1481
01:44:17,190 --> 01:44:27,815
[SPEAKER_08]: So, speaking of Xbox 360 updates and possible bannings of people and stuff like that, there is another update that's going to ban stuff, and that will be, of course, the fall update.

1482
01:44:28,315 --> 01:44:31,397
[SPEAKER_08]: It will be banning unauthorized memory units.

1483
01:44:31,577 --> 01:44:40,861
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, you may remember we talked a little bit about max memory units being put out by, I believe, Datel, and these will allow you to use a...

1484
01:44:42,842 --> 01:44:48,605
[SPEAKER_08]: was a micro SD card and supported up to 2GB to 4GB of memory.

1485
01:44:49,085 --> 01:44:52,647
[SPEAKER_08]: Which is awesome, because the Microsoft memory units are really fucking expensive.

1486
01:44:53,627 --> 01:44:59,690
[SPEAKER_08]: For like $50 or $40, you get a 512MB memory unit, which is ridiculous.

1487
01:45:00,071 --> 01:45:03,552
[SPEAKER_08]: Especially since, hell, you can get a 4GB USB drive for nothing.

1488
01:45:03,572 --> 01:45:03,612
[SPEAKER_08]: So...

1489
01:45:10,566 --> 01:45:12,949
[SPEAKER_08]: Being the greedy bastards that they are, they decided, hey, you know what?

1490
01:45:13,469 --> 01:45:16,713
[SPEAKER_08]: We don't want you to sell this, and so we're going to block it.

1491
01:45:17,033 --> 01:45:19,336
[SPEAKER_08]: So if you bought it, you're shit out of luck.

1492
01:45:20,837 --> 01:45:22,799
[SPEAKER_08]: And there's nothing you can do about it.

1493
01:45:22,920 --> 01:45:23,741
[SPEAKER_08]: But people are pissed.

1494
01:45:24,301 --> 01:45:26,423
[SPEAKER_08]: But Microsoft says, who gives a shit?

1495
01:45:26,463 --> 01:45:26,964
[SPEAKER_08]: It's our console.

1496
01:45:26,984 --> 01:45:27,665
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll do what we want.

1497
01:45:27,745 --> 01:45:28,566
[SPEAKER_08]: Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah.

1498
01:45:30,456 --> 01:45:31,717
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm kind of on the fence with this.

1499
01:45:31,817 --> 01:45:34,759
[SPEAKER_09]: I think they... They have the right to do it, but it's a dick move.

1500
01:45:34,779 --> 01:45:38,322
[SPEAKER_09]: They have the right to do it, but it's a cock-block move is what they're doing.

1501
01:45:38,902 --> 01:45:45,486
[SPEAKER_09]: It kind of sucks because the person who loses here is the consumer, not the developer of this memory unit.

1502
01:45:45,947 --> 01:45:48,468
[SPEAKER_09]: They already made the money from selling it to the consumer.

1503
01:45:48,509 --> 01:45:51,431
[SPEAKER_09]: It's the consumer who's shit out of luck.

1504
01:45:51,931 --> 01:45:52,892
[SPEAKER_09]: If I'm understanding this right...

1505
01:45:53,692 --> 01:45:59,196
[SPEAKER_09]: This isn't aimed so much as things that might be in stores, because there aren't a lot of these unauthorized things in stores.

1506
01:45:59,397 --> 01:46:02,619
[SPEAKER_09]: This is aimed at people trying to jerry-rig hard drives to do everything, right?

1507
01:46:03,520 --> 01:46:10,105
[SPEAKER_08]: No, this is aimed at... Well, these devices are aimed at just the consumer, but it's a cheaper alternative with more memory.

1508
01:46:11,226 --> 01:46:12,707
[SPEAKER_08]: But it's not being offered by Microsoft.

1509
01:46:13,528 --> 01:46:16,170
[SPEAKER_08]: And so, therefore, it goes away.

1510
01:46:17,807 --> 01:46:19,868
[SPEAKER_08]: It's the same reason why there's no third-party hard drives.

1511
01:46:20,168 --> 01:46:23,030
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I can tell you this much, hard drives are damn cheap.

1512
01:46:23,270 --> 01:46:25,751
[SPEAKER_08]: Especially these drives they're offering for $150.

1513
01:46:26,131 --> 01:46:27,812
[SPEAKER_08]: You can get a terabyte drive for $150.

1514
01:46:28,072 --> 01:46:30,993
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess that's true.

1515
01:46:31,013 --> 01:46:35,515
[SPEAKER_09]: I think Microsoft does kind of rip off a little bit with their storage, but this is...

1516
01:46:38,806 --> 01:46:40,808
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1517
01:47:03,426 --> 01:47:05,327
[SPEAKER_08]: So they can block it by the device ID.

1518
01:47:05,667 --> 01:47:07,569
[SPEAKER_08]: Same with controllers if they want to.

1519
01:47:07,609 --> 01:47:09,751
[SPEAKER_08]: I think they can block controllers that way too.

1520
01:47:10,731 --> 01:47:11,172
[SPEAKER_08]: But they don't.

1521
01:47:12,693 --> 01:47:24,542
[SPEAKER_08]: But the thing is though, when the new 250GB hard drives come out, there are ways out there to make your own hard drive for the 360 by modifying a laptop hard drive.

1522
01:47:25,363 --> 01:47:27,585
[SPEAKER_08]: So if you want to go through the trouble, you can do that for cheaper.

1523
01:47:27,845 --> 01:47:28,986
[SPEAKER_08]: And now you can do it up to 250GB.

1524
01:47:31,340 --> 01:47:32,821
[SPEAKER_09]: Super Mario Bros.

1525
01:47:33,242 --> 01:47:33,302
[SPEAKER_09]: Wii

1526
01:47:49,955 --> 01:47:50,555
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1527
01:48:14,332 --> 01:48:16,553
[SPEAKER_09]: What will happen is that then a video is going to show up.

1528
01:48:16,713 --> 01:48:18,314
[SPEAKER_09]: Luigi plays through the stage.

1529
01:48:18,674 --> 01:48:20,195
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not going to show you hidden paths.

1530
01:48:20,495 --> 01:48:21,895
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not going to show you hidden coins.

1531
01:48:21,995 --> 01:48:23,696
[SPEAKER_09]: It just kind of shows you how to get through the stage.

1532
01:48:24,156 --> 01:48:26,097
[SPEAKER_09]: It will show you how the stage could be completed.

1533
01:48:26,538 --> 01:48:34,521
[SPEAKER_09]: At any time, the player can jump in and take over, and then the game basically will have played you through the parts you can't get through.

1534
01:48:36,102 --> 01:48:40,244
[SPEAKER_09]: If you want, though, you can just let the game complete the level for you and move on to the next stage.

1535
01:48:41,184 --> 01:48:44,347
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, Miyamoto has said there are some disadvantages to using Super Guide.

1536
01:48:44,908 --> 01:48:51,154
[SPEAKER_09]: If you decide not to use the Super Guide at all during the game, you stay away from the blocks and don't use them, you get something special.

1537
01:48:51,655 --> 01:48:53,136
[SPEAKER_09]: Of course, that could be anything.

1538
01:48:53,217 --> 01:48:55,239
[SPEAKER_09]: Could that be something new on the title screen?

1539
01:48:55,279 --> 01:48:56,620
[SPEAKER_09]: Could it be an unlockable character?

1540
01:48:56,920 --> 01:48:57,781
[SPEAKER_09]: Who knows what that could be.

1541
01:48:58,322 --> 01:48:59,983
[SPEAKER_09]: But if you rely on them, you're going to miss out.

1542
01:49:00,644 --> 01:49:02,046
[SPEAKER_09]: And, of course, you know...

1543
01:49:02,786 --> 01:49:06,047
[SPEAKER_09]: Just the whole morale of the fact you had to use the Super Guide to beat the level.

1544
01:49:06,367 --> 01:49:11,569
[SPEAKER_09]: A quote from Miyamoto in a little article that is running on Destructoid right now.

1545
01:49:12,229 --> 01:49:17,851
[SPEAKER_09]: I find that when the Super Guide block does appear, I kind of feel regretful and guilty that I've let that happen.

1546
01:49:18,171 --> 01:49:21,932
[SPEAKER_09]: So I've often found that playing the game, when that happens, it kind of inspires me to say...

1547
01:49:22,412 --> 01:49:25,133
[SPEAKER_09]: I've already done this bad, now I have to clear the level on my own.

1548
01:49:25,613 --> 01:49:32,535
[SPEAKER_09]: So, you know, I guess they're saying that you just feel a general sense of, well, you cheated to beat the level in order to actually get through it.

1549
01:49:33,235 --> 01:49:36,216
[SPEAKER_09]: So, I don't know, what do you guys think?

1550
01:49:36,256 --> 01:49:42,378
[SPEAKER_09]: Now that you hear the details on how this actually works, that it's a brick that appears if you die eight times, what do you think?

1551
01:49:42,438 --> 01:49:43,438
[SPEAKER_09]: Is it still a joke?

1552
01:49:44,079 --> 01:49:44,659
[SPEAKER_08]: Is it useful?

1553
01:49:45,179 --> 01:49:48,320
[SPEAKER_08]: It's got a use for it, but, you know, at the same time, it's kind of...

1554
01:49:49,420 --> 01:49:50,841
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks for watching!

1555
01:50:11,169 --> 01:50:12,730
[SPEAKER_08]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1556
01:50:34,286 --> 01:50:35,528
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll talk to her President Cat

1557
01:50:48,823 --> 01:50:56,548
[SPEAKER_09]: GameGuru says, Problem with Wii HD coming out before the next Xbox or PlayStation is that it won't be graphically on par with them and won't initially have the Wii's fanbase.

1558
01:50:56,568 --> 01:51:00,130
[SPEAKER_09]: That's going back to a previous news story, but that's okay because I know there's a little delay.

1559
01:51:01,051 --> 01:51:04,273
[SPEAKER_09]: XLink calls this Super Cheater 5000 is the name of the device.

1560
01:51:04,773 --> 01:51:08,035
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, again, I think we have to remember the audience this is aimed at.

1561
01:51:08,135 --> 01:51:11,658
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think for the casual player, this is...

1562
01:51:12,972 --> 01:51:34,402
[SPEAKER_09]: you know, gonna be a good thing but I think for the rest of us I do really like the fact that you at least get some unlockable if you don't do it I just hope that unlockable carries some weight a little bit you know, unfortunately Wii doesn't have anything like achievements so hopefully it'll have some type of e-peen that you can show other people because who doesn't like to stroke their e-peen?

1563
01:51:36,243 --> 01:51:37,784
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, don't you love to stroke your E-peen?

1564
01:51:38,184 --> 01:51:38,384
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1565
01:51:38,565 --> 01:51:38,785
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright.

1566
01:51:39,165 --> 01:51:48,891
[SPEAKER_09]: One way DarkSakura likes to stroke her E-peen is every week she'll open up the mailbag and read some emails from our listeners at MailbagAtOrangeLoungeRadio.com So DarkSakura, please open up the mailbag.

1567
01:51:49,812 --> 01:51:52,093
[SPEAKER_09]: There wasn't very much when I looked in there earlier, but maybe there is now.

1568
01:51:52,113 --> 01:51:52,994
[SPEAKER_06]: There's one.

1569
01:51:53,414 --> 01:51:54,074
[SPEAKER_09]: One email!

1570
01:51:54,355 --> 01:51:55,035
[SPEAKER_06]: From J-Rod.

1571
01:51:55,195 --> 01:51:56,296
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, well let's read it tonight.

1572
01:51:56,316 --> 01:51:57,397
[SPEAKER_09]: It's tonight's mailbag segment.

1573
01:51:57,837 --> 01:52:01,479
[SPEAKER_09]: And we'll just have to roll anything that comes in now to next week.

1574
01:52:01,679 --> 01:52:05,502
[SPEAKER_09]: I anticipate we're going to have a lot of President Cat emails this week, but we'll see.

1575
01:52:06,397 --> 01:52:07,437
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello, OLR crew.

1576
01:52:08,278 --> 01:52:13,299
[SPEAKER_06]: I currently listen to the latest podcast on the feed where Robin Loki completely trashed the PSP Go.

1577
01:52:13,839 --> 01:52:21,002
[SPEAKER_06]: What everyone who badmouths the PSP Go needs to realize is that maybe the PSP Go is supposed to be a new PSP owner purchase and not an upgrade.

1578
01:52:21,382 --> 01:52:27,123
[SPEAKER_06]: I never had a PSP before, but seeing all the stuff on PSN and the new PSP Go pushed me over the edge to get one finally.

1579
01:52:27,664 --> 01:52:31,585
[SPEAKER_06]: It is a sleek portable and the sliding screen looks cool as hell.

1580
01:52:32,165 --> 01:52:40,830
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, if I owned an older PSP, of course, I wouldn't buy the PSP Go the same way I wouldn't buy a DSi if I owned a Lite or a Phat.

1581
01:52:41,691 --> 01:52:46,734
[SPEAKER_06]: I honestly don't think the PSP Go is even aimed at the current PSP owners, but new customers like myself.

1582
01:52:47,274 --> 01:52:51,037
[SPEAKER_06]: So really, no need to take a shit on it, just don't buy it and enjoy your current PSPs.

1583
01:52:51,317 --> 01:52:55,079
[SPEAKER_06]: This email is sponsored by the Olive Garden Home of the Reverending Salad and Breadsticks.

1584
01:52:55,700 --> 01:52:57,641
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, I will say this, and this is me.

1585
01:52:58,081 --> 01:52:59,102
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, this is just me.

1586
01:53:01,241 --> 01:53:11,657
[SPEAKER_06]: If I was a new customer and I was told to pick one to buy, if they were all the same price, I would pick the $3,000.

1587
01:53:15,091 --> 01:53:15,791
[SPEAKER_06]: I wouldn't get a go.

1588
01:53:16,292 --> 01:53:18,993
[SPEAKER_09]: And we've said on this show that the PSP 3000 is a great system.

1589
01:53:19,213 --> 01:53:19,794
[SPEAKER_09]: It's pretty cool.

1590
01:53:19,994 --> 01:53:24,056
[SPEAKER_08]: And the thing is, I don't understand why you would pay more money for a system that does less, basically.

1591
01:53:24,556 --> 01:53:25,937
[SPEAKER_08]: That's my question.

1592
01:53:25,997 --> 01:53:30,720
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not even talking about people that own a PlayStation Portable already, because there's no reason that you need another system.

1593
01:53:30,880 --> 01:53:32,841
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't understand that at all, why we would buy another one.

1594
01:53:33,181 --> 01:53:36,203
[SPEAKER_08]: Why I said that, because I actually have two PSPs, but the 2000 actually had...

1595
01:53:37,915 --> 01:53:39,279
[SPEAKER_08]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1596
01:53:45,799 --> 01:53:59,642
[SPEAKER_08]: The fact is, the 3000 is cheaper, it plays the same downloadable games, plus you have the option now to purchase games that are on UMD, plus you can get memory units and stuff like that for it.

1597
01:53:59,682 --> 01:54:02,263
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, it doesn't have built-in memory, but you know what?

1598
01:54:02,703 --> 01:54:07,644
[SPEAKER_08]: Memory's cheap, so it's not really worth paying the extra money for memory that's in the system.

1599
01:54:08,004 --> 01:54:13,405
[SPEAKER_08]: And that sliding screen may look cool and stuff, but at the same time, I'm wondering how soon that's going to break.

1600
01:54:14,305 --> 01:54:24,111
[SPEAKER_08]: and, you know, I do give them credit for the fact that they have, you know, the ability to sync up your DualShock 3 controller with it to, you know, play games when you have it hooked up to your TV.

1601
01:54:24,551 --> 01:54:28,694
[SPEAKER_08]: I can't say that I've actually used that function on my PSP 2000.

1602
01:54:29,855 --> 01:54:35,278
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I've played games on TV before, but maybe once or twice to see it, you know, check it out.

1603
01:54:36,755 --> 01:54:41,078
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know, it's just... I don't understand why you would pay more money for a system that does less.

1604
01:54:41,318 --> 01:54:42,739
[SPEAKER_08]: That's basically my argument.

1605
01:54:42,879 --> 01:54:48,143
[SPEAKER_08]: But hey, if you want to, and if you think it's a cool looking system or whatever, more power to you, but...

1606
01:54:50,888 --> 01:54:51,569
[SPEAKER_06]: I got to try one.

1607
01:54:53,090 --> 01:54:57,753
[SPEAKER_06]: A guy in my art history class had one.

1608
01:54:57,794 --> 01:55:02,157
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I didn't really sit and play on anything, but he let me hold it and push the buttons.

1609
01:55:02,918 --> 01:55:05,680
[SPEAKER_06]: And I have to say that it really felt flimsy.

1610
01:55:06,080 --> 01:55:06,620
[SPEAKER_06]: It felt...

1611
01:55:08,089 --> 01:55:08,990
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1612
01:55:27,196 --> 01:55:36,122
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to take a quick poll in here because I want to kind of address the Sony people for a minute because especially in reading some of the reviews on Twitter and so forth.

1613
01:55:36,402 --> 01:55:37,183
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sorry, not Twitter.

1614
01:55:37,823 --> 01:55:41,346
[SPEAKER_09]: Twitter's on my mind tonight because of everything else going on, but iTunes and everything.

1615
01:55:42,046 --> 01:55:46,069
[SPEAKER_09]: People have been unnecessarily harsh to our program because they think we're slanted against Sony.

1616
01:55:46,469 --> 01:55:47,550
[SPEAKER_09]: And I want to make it very clear.

1617
01:55:47,750 --> 01:55:48,411
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not the case.

1618
01:55:49,031 --> 01:55:50,872
[SPEAKER_09]: We haze people when they deserve to be hazed.

1619
01:55:51,333 --> 01:55:52,814
[SPEAKER_09]: And I want to prove that here with something.

1620
01:55:52,854 --> 01:55:57,537
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm not saying this particular emailer is a part of that because I know he's emailed us a bunch about various topics.

1621
01:55:57,918 --> 01:56:00,639
[SPEAKER_09]: But I'm just saying, hold on a minute because it works both ways here.

1622
01:56:00,720 --> 01:56:01,960
[SPEAKER_09]: Quick poll of the room.

1623
01:56:02,521 --> 01:56:05,123
[SPEAKER_09]: How many of you own a DSi?

1624
01:56:07,054 --> 01:56:07,795
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I don't.

1625
01:56:08,075 --> 01:56:08,535
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't.

1626
01:56:08,855 --> 01:56:09,356
[SPEAKER_09]: Exactly.

1627
01:56:09,616 --> 01:56:11,317
[SPEAKER_09]: None of us own a DSi either.

1628
01:56:11,717 --> 01:56:13,258
[SPEAKER_09]: And for many of the same reasons.

1629
01:56:13,578 --> 01:56:16,280
[SPEAKER_09]: Because what's the difference between a DS and a DSi?

1630
01:56:16,460 --> 01:56:17,581
[SPEAKER_09]: It has a camera.

1631
01:56:17,861 --> 01:56:18,322
[SPEAKER_09]: It has a camera.

1632
01:56:18,342 --> 01:56:21,324
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll get a DSi when there are more specific DSi games.

1633
01:56:22,244 --> 01:56:26,027
[SPEAKER_06]: But other than that, there's no legitimate reason for me to have a DSi.

1634
01:56:26,307 --> 01:56:28,068
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just it's got a camera with it.

1635
01:56:28,268 --> 01:56:29,909
[SPEAKER_08]: And, you know, the price points are pretty similar.

1636
01:56:30,410 --> 01:56:33,972
[SPEAKER_08]: But at the same time, it doesn't warrant me purchasing another system that plays the same games.

1637
01:56:33,992 --> 01:56:35,773
[SPEAKER_06]: They put out a camera on the old...

1638
01:56:37,294 --> 01:56:38,995
[SPEAKER_06]: Game Boy Color, guess who didn't buy one?

1639
01:56:39,396 --> 01:56:39,656
[SPEAKER_06]: Me.

1640
01:56:39,956 --> 01:56:41,517
[SPEAKER_09]: Eddie is saying two cameras.

1641
01:56:42,198 --> 01:56:43,318
[SPEAKER_09]: But here's something else to consider.

1642
01:56:44,239 --> 01:56:47,341
[SPEAKER_09]: If I remember right, the DSi got rid of the Game Boy Advance slot too.

1643
01:56:47,601 --> 01:56:48,082
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly.

1644
01:56:48,102 --> 01:56:49,002
[SPEAKER_09]: So you can't play games.

1645
01:56:49,643 --> 01:56:54,906
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's in a way almost just as bad as the PSP Go and the PSP 3000.

1646
01:56:54,966 --> 01:56:58,008
[SPEAKER_09]: Here's my question that is not really being answered.

1647
01:56:58,369 --> 01:57:04,293
[SPEAKER_09]: What do you get with the PSP Go that you don't get on the PSP 3000 that justifies the increased price?

1648
01:57:05,663 --> 01:57:14,389
[SPEAKER_08]: At least in the DS world, you can say a camera, the downloadable game service, and the SD card support.

1649
01:57:14,409 --> 01:57:15,489
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, fair enough.

1650
01:57:15,509 --> 01:57:17,030
[SPEAKER_09]: So you've named a couple things that you have with the DS.

1651
01:57:17,331 --> 01:57:18,451
[SPEAKER_09]: And I even knocked on that.

1652
01:57:18,972 --> 01:57:20,453
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not enough for me.

1653
01:57:21,113 --> 01:57:21,393
[SPEAKER_09]: For me.

1654
01:57:21,653 --> 01:57:25,376
[SPEAKER_09]: But for a new player, okay, now you have to weigh the pros and the cons.

1655
01:57:25,676 --> 01:57:28,217
[SPEAKER_09]: Con, I don't get to play Game Boy Advance games anymore.

1656
01:57:28,518 --> 01:57:31,400
[SPEAKER_09]: Pros, I get a camera, SD card slot, and downloadable games.

1657
01:57:31,720 --> 01:57:32,300
[SPEAKER_09]: What do I want to do?

1658
01:57:32,660 --> 01:57:33,961
[SPEAKER_09]: But with the PSP 3000 and the PSP Go...

1659
01:57:35,622 --> 01:57:36,343
[SPEAKER_09]: You have to weigh.

1660
01:57:36,783 --> 01:57:37,243
[SPEAKER_09]: Con.

1661
01:57:37,644 --> 01:57:39,725
[SPEAKER_09]: It's more expensive and I lose the UMD.

1662
01:57:40,125 --> 01:57:40,545
[SPEAKER_09]: Pro.

1663
01:57:42,587 --> 01:57:43,167
[SPEAKER_09]: Chirp, chirp.

1664
01:57:43,247 --> 01:57:43,907
[SPEAKER_08]: It's cuter.

1665
01:57:44,788 --> 01:57:47,890
[SPEAKER_08]: It's sleeker looking and it's got Bluetooth support.

1666
01:57:48,971 --> 01:57:49,151
[SPEAKER_06]: So?

1667
01:57:49,893 --> 01:57:50,874
[SPEAKER_08]: That's it.

1668
01:57:51,654 --> 01:57:59,939
[SPEAKER_08]: And with the DSi even, if you are purchasing a new system, you're probably not going to be able to buy any Game Boy Advance games anyways out there because they're not selling them anymore.

1669
01:57:59,959 --> 01:58:01,500
[SPEAKER_08]: They haven't been selling them for a few years now.

1670
01:58:01,560 --> 01:58:10,866
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's not going to be that big a deal if you can't have a Game Boy Advance slot on there to people that are just getting into the DS or whatever.

1671
01:58:10,906 --> 01:58:12,747
[SPEAKER_08]: And the DSi would be a good purchase for them.

1672
01:58:14,028 --> 01:58:17,450
[SPEAKER_08]: But if you have Game Boy Advance games and you have a DS...

1673
01:58:18,564 --> 01:58:20,446
[SPEAKER_08]: Why would you go and buy another game system?

1674
01:58:21,147 --> 01:58:27,454
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm glad to know it's not just us tonight because there's a little bit of DSI rabble-rabble going on in chat as well, but there is some comments.

1675
01:58:27,874 --> 01:58:33,440
[SPEAKER_09]: SSJ100Matt says, Aside from them putting President Cat on DSI, I never see myself getting a DSI.

1676
01:58:33,821 --> 01:58:35,743
[SPEAKER_09]: And Actdeft says, Matt, indeed.

1677
01:58:35,803 --> 01:58:38,065
[SPEAKER_09]: President Cat on the DSI and I'll buy it instantly.

1678
01:58:38,386 --> 01:58:39,407
[SPEAKER_09]: Which, by the way, I want to say...

1679
01:58:39,687 --> 01:58:40,928
[SPEAKER_09]: How fucking adorable is this?

1680
01:58:41,308 --> 01:58:44,829
[SPEAKER_09]: Actdeft tweeted the Rina Wee people to say, Hey, I'm in Mexico.

1681
01:58:45,229 --> 01:58:46,250
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not just USA people.

1682
01:58:46,290 --> 01:58:47,590
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm in Mexico, and I think you're great.

1683
01:58:48,091 --> 01:58:49,811
[SPEAKER_09]: And they responded, Gracias.

1684
01:58:51,032 --> 01:58:51,652
[SPEAKER_09]: How adorable.

1685
01:58:52,453 --> 01:58:53,393
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to hug them all.

1686
01:58:54,213 --> 01:58:54,554
[SPEAKER_14]: I do.

1687
01:58:55,174 --> 01:58:56,314
[SPEAKER_14]: I want President Cat.

1688
01:58:56,774 --> 01:58:58,955
[SPEAKER_08]: Aren't you going to be traveling to Japan?

1689
01:58:59,136 --> 01:59:01,236
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm supposed to travel to Japan in June, yes.

1690
01:59:01,417 --> 01:59:03,918
[SPEAKER_09]: In fact, I will be gone from the show for two or three weeks.

1691
01:59:04,218 --> 01:59:04,758
[SPEAKER_03]: Take me with you.

1692
01:59:05,838 --> 01:59:06,339
[SPEAKER_09]: You got money?

1693
01:59:06,559 --> 01:59:08,460
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going on a tour type thing, so we'll see.

1694
01:59:08,480 --> 01:59:09,240
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

1695
01:59:09,710 --> 01:59:11,873
[SPEAKER_09]: Rob, I have to teach you how to shop.

1696
01:59:11,913 --> 01:59:13,395
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to teach you how to shop.

1697
01:59:27,506 --> 01:59:29,967
[SPEAKER_09]: And ask for directions.

1698
01:59:29,987 --> 01:59:31,307
[SPEAKER_09]: Teach me five-year-old Japanese.

1699
01:59:31,547 --> 01:59:32,948
[SPEAKER_06]: I will teach you five-year-old Japanese.

1700
01:59:33,568 --> 01:59:35,228
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, I know five-year-old Japanese.

1701
01:59:35,649 --> 01:59:42,731
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, so anyway, if you want more emails, mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com Loki, we... Oh, I'm sorry.

1702
01:59:42,811 --> 01:59:45,272
[SPEAKER_09]: Before we get into that, I'm just all off tonight.

1703
01:59:45,292 --> 01:59:46,112
[SPEAKER_09]: It's alright.

1704
01:59:46,172 --> 01:59:46,952
[SPEAKER_09]: It's President Cat.

1705
01:59:47,652 --> 01:59:49,173
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not even just President Cat.

1706
01:59:49,213 --> 01:59:50,273
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what started it all?

1707
01:59:51,834 --> 01:59:52,314
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, yes.

1708
01:59:59,895 --> 02:00:01,476
[SPEAKER_09]: You thought I forgot about that, didn't you?

1709
02:00:06,459 --> 02:00:07,040
[SPEAKER_09]: It's official.

1710
02:00:07,180 --> 02:00:09,041
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura is in the corner crying.

1711
02:00:10,202 --> 02:00:10,902
[SPEAKER_06]: I was not.

1712
02:00:11,062 --> 02:00:11,683
[SPEAKER_06]: I got you.

1713
02:00:11,783 --> 02:00:13,264
[SPEAKER_06]: And I flip Rob off a lot.

1714
02:00:16,923 --> 02:00:17,944
[SPEAKER_09]: This is just one of those shows.

1715
02:00:17,964 --> 02:00:20,425
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, I was driving here tonight thinking, God, I'm tired.

1716
02:00:20,465 --> 02:00:22,066
[SPEAKER_09]: This is just going to be a crappy show tonight.

1717
02:00:22,246 --> 02:00:23,387
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, no, this is great.

1718
02:00:24,067 --> 02:00:24,787
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm having a good time.

1719
02:00:25,048 --> 02:00:29,830
[SPEAKER_09]: But I swear to God, if you make me sick, not even President Cat can help you where you're going to go.

1720
02:00:30,471 --> 02:00:31,451
[SPEAKER_14]: President Cat.

1721
02:00:34,012 --> 02:00:34,373
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyhow.

1722
02:00:34,853 --> 02:00:36,014
[SPEAKER_06]: Rob, you know what I have?

1723
02:00:36,034 --> 02:00:36,794
[SPEAKER_06]: What?

1724
02:00:36,814 --> 02:00:38,015
[SPEAKER_06]: I have a case of meh.

1725
02:00:38,775 --> 02:00:42,338
[SPEAKER_09]: Leo Shannon Chat says, Rob, I made that my new iPhone ringtone.

1726
02:00:42,718 --> 02:00:43,018
[SPEAKER_09]: Awesome.

1727
02:00:43,699 --> 02:00:45,580
[SPEAKER_09]: DJ Dark Knight says, Flying Shoe coming up.

1728
02:00:45,760 --> 02:00:46,001
[SPEAKER_09]: Lol.

1729
02:00:46,381 --> 02:00:48,542
[SPEAKER_09]: And X-Link says, I was also in the corner crying.

1730
02:00:49,403 --> 02:00:52,966
[SPEAKER_09]: Those comments from our lovely chat room, chat.orangeloungeradio.com.

1731
02:00:53,346 --> 02:00:53,626
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1732
02:00:53,666 --> 02:00:57,229
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, maybe for those of you that are sick and tired of Daytona, this segment is just for you.

1733
02:00:57,269 --> 02:00:58,410
[SPEAKER_09]: It's the F-Views of the Week.

1734
02:01:14,161 --> 02:01:19,344
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, so starting off tonight, the story that inspired our FUs of the Week.

1735
02:01:20,224 --> 02:01:23,306
[SPEAKER_09]: Apparently a 15-year-old was set on fire this week.

1736
02:01:24,107 --> 02:01:25,147
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's not cool.

1737
02:01:25,167 --> 02:01:31,431
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, as much as we joke about fire, fire is to look at on the Indiana Jones ride and yell cool at or fuego.

1738
02:01:31,511 --> 02:01:33,772
[SPEAKER_09]: You don't actually set people on fire.

1739
02:01:34,112 --> 02:01:34,913
[SPEAKER_09]: That is not cool.

1740
02:01:36,194 --> 02:02:01,228
[SPEAKER_09]: and unfortunately his poor kid Michael Brewer was set on fire and the reason why because Brewer owed one of the suspects who's been arrested US $40 for a video game this video game debt apparently made the suspect steal the father's bicycle Brewer reported the bicycle was stolen the suspect got arrested but the suspect was released from a detention center on Monday morning

1741
02:02:01,688 --> 02:02:04,251
[SPEAKER_09]: and then Brewer was waiting for friends in an apartment complex.

1742
02:02:04,591 --> 02:02:11,958
[SPEAKER_09]: The suspect, I guess, came up saying he's a snitch, a snitch and poured on him and they poured alcohol and lighter and yeah, gross.

1743
02:02:12,459 --> 02:02:14,561
[SPEAKER_09]: So, I mean, just what a monster.

1744
02:02:15,362 --> 02:02:16,022
[SPEAKER_09]: What an ass.

1745
02:02:16,222 --> 02:02:17,564
[SPEAKER_09]: And over a video game debt.

1746
02:02:18,684 --> 02:02:23,767
[SPEAKER_09]: and it prompted one sheriff to say in 31 years it's the most heinous crime I've ever seen.

1747
02:02:24,287 --> 02:02:26,508
[SPEAKER_09]: All over $40 over a video game.

1748
02:02:27,289 --> 02:02:33,152
[SPEAKER_09]: FU suspect whose name they clearly haven't released because he's a minor but they should so we can dedicate this segment to him.

1749
02:02:34,012 --> 02:02:35,133
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, do you have any FUs of the week?

1750
02:02:36,484 --> 02:02:43,288
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm actually just trying to verify that I was reading this properly, because they asked us what President Cat is, so I was going to say, doesn't that mean President?

1751
02:02:43,828 --> 02:02:45,309
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, I'm about to say.

1752
02:02:45,629 --> 02:02:56,175
[SPEAKER_06]: But, yeah, F you to my co-worker, who I refer to all the time as Mr. Annoying, for acting like a five-year-old baby and tattletailing on something that didn't involve him.

1753
02:02:58,276 --> 02:02:59,257
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki, do you have any F's of the week?

1754
02:03:00,856 --> 02:03:03,558
[SPEAKER_08]: My FQ of the week goes to Pushy Salesman.

1755
02:03:03,698 --> 02:03:05,959
[SPEAKER_08]: Especially people that come door-to-door selling stuff.

1756
02:03:06,379 --> 02:03:09,341
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I'm always a sucker and open the door, and I really shouldn't.

1757
02:03:10,862 --> 02:03:14,644
[SPEAKER_08]: So we had a guy that we were looking for roof quotes because we need a new roof on our house.

1758
02:03:15,725 --> 02:03:20,647
[SPEAKER_08]: And this guy came and gave us this sales pitch that took two hours.

1759
02:03:22,488 --> 02:03:26,891
[SPEAKER_08]: And, well, he was really pushy and annoying, so...

1760
02:03:28,200 --> 02:03:32,541
[SPEAKER_08]: It sucked, and if I hadn't answered the door, I wouldn't have to deal with it.

1761
02:03:32,661 --> 02:03:35,702
[SPEAKER_08]: So, uh... F you to that, because I hate these people.

1762
02:03:38,182 --> 02:03:45,584
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, my F you of the week just goes to, um... Gosh, I... Tonight I've laughed so hard, I'm actually not that angsty.

1763
02:03:45,624 --> 02:03:48,424
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess my F you goes to, uh... Drama.

1764
02:03:50,025 --> 02:03:50,445
[SPEAKER_09]: Drama!

1765
02:03:50,665 --> 02:03:51,205
[SPEAKER_09]: In general.

1766
02:03:51,745 --> 02:03:55,366
[SPEAKER_09]: Although, honestly, you know... Things are okay.

1767
02:03:55,486 --> 02:03:56,586
[SPEAKER_09]: I can't complain too much.

1768
02:03:57,031 --> 02:03:58,533
[SPEAKER_06]: Everything's better with President Cat.

1769
02:03:58,573 --> 02:03:59,053
[SPEAKER_09]: It really is.

1770
02:03:59,093 --> 02:04:02,877
[SPEAKER_09]: Although now we're defining out President... When the official people are saying, what's President Cat?

1771
02:04:03,437 --> 02:04:04,859
[SPEAKER_09]: Clearly that is not the name of the game.

1772
02:04:04,879 --> 02:04:07,201
[SPEAKER_09]: So I just tweeted him, do you have a better translation?

1773
02:04:08,282 --> 02:04:08,743
[SPEAKER_06]: I see that.

1774
02:04:08,783 --> 02:04:13,508
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, that's what... I copied the actual kanji over because... Was it sensential?

1775
02:04:13,748 --> 02:04:15,049
[SPEAKER_06]: Mm-hmm.

1776
02:04:15,530 --> 02:04:15,910
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like...

1777
02:04:17,697 --> 02:04:24,185
[SPEAKER_06]: For example, there's a different word that's similar that means class president when you're in school and so-and-so president.

1778
02:04:24,225 --> 02:04:26,708
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a different type of position.

1779
02:04:27,329 --> 02:04:29,672
[SPEAKER_06]: And president would be the closest equivalent.

1780
02:04:31,150 --> 02:04:31,791
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1781
02:04:53,106 --> 02:04:54,327
[SPEAKER_08]: That could be the cover of the game.

1782
02:04:55,027 --> 02:04:56,468
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to make that for the website.

1783
02:04:56,508 --> 02:04:57,028
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm telling you.

1784
02:04:57,828 --> 02:04:58,448
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to do it.

1785
02:04:58,789 --> 02:04:59,869
[SPEAKER_09]: I can't stress this enough.

1786
02:05:00,209 --> 02:05:06,392
[SPEAKER_09]: Please upload your president cat or whatever the hell this game is called, your fan art, your whatever.

1787
02:05:06,952 --> 02:05:15,536
[SPEAKER_09]: Put it on the OLR pics thing and then tweet it to this poor girl who doesn't know what the hell she just woke up to today here and show them the love.

1788
02:05:16,116 --> 02:05:17,237
[SPEAKER_06]: Renna is the cat's name.

1789
02:05:17,657 --> 02:05:17,897
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

1790
02:05:18,017 --> 02:05:18,277
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

1791
02:05:18,297 --> 02:05:19,218
[SPEAKER_08]: I got the Renna part.

1792
02:05:19,278 --> 02:05:19,558
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

1793
02:05:20,769 --> 02:05:25,491
[SPEAKER_06]: and Sancho would be, I guess, like company president?

1794
02:05:25,871 --> 02:05:27,491
[SPEAKER_09]: Just call it Obama Cat and be done with it.

1795
02:05:27,911 --> 02:05:29,352
[SPEAKER_09]: The game will sell millions of copies.

1796
02:05:31,212 --> 02:05:34,073
[SPEAKER_09]: It'll be on Fox News about how it brainwashes kids and we'll laugh.

1797
02:05:35,113 --> 02:05:44,956
[SPEAKER_05]: The one, Sukibon, I think, has to do with... I think it means something about female something.

1798
02:05:45,877 --> 02:05:46,257
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

1799
02:05:47,377 --> 02:05:47,737
[SPEAKER_04]: I think.

1800
02:05:48,317 --> 02:05:50,078
[SPEAKER_09]: Dark Tetsuya says, Top Cat...

1801
02:05:53,432 --> 02:05:55,394
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh god, like Top Chef, Top Cat, I'd love that.

1802
02:05:55,894 --> 02:05:59,137
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, anyhow, let's move on with a couple more stories.

1803
02:05:59,337 --> 02:06:01,398
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, Sukeban means delinquent girl.

1804
02:06:02,819 --> 02:06:03,440
[SPEAKER_09]: Interesting.

1805
02:06:03,640 --> 02:06:04,521
[SPEAKER_06]: Or boss girl.

1806
02:06:04,541 --> 02:06:06,062
[SPEAKER_09]: So is the game like Naughty Cat?

1807
02:06:06,142 --> 02:06:06,962
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, that would be amazing.

1808
02:06:07,983 --> 02:06:20,713
[SPEAKER_06]: So, well, I knew that it had something to do with a girl, because it's like, I know characters who've been in series that have, like Sukeban Deka, it has to do with like a delinquent girl who uses a yo-yo as a weapon.

1809
02:06:21,505 --> 02:06:26,047
[SPEAKER_06]: or like a female gang leader for a school gang.

1810
02:06:28,007 --> 02:06:35,630
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm guessing it's sort of like female boss Katrina or female boss Rina.

1811
02:06:36,010 --> 02:06:37,310
[SPEAKER_06]: Kat's not actually in the name.

1812
02:06:38,271 --> 02:06:38,691
[SPEAKER_09]: Interesting.

1813
02:06:39,011 --> 02:06:39,171
[SPEAKER_06]: So...

1814
02:06:40,222 --> 02:06:44,986
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, well, if they should download the show and listen to it, just know we've decided that that should be the name of the game.

1815
02:06:45,386 --> 02:06:45,687
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright.

1816
02:06:47,128 --> 02:06:52,452
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyhow, a couple more news stories for you, and then the Skype line to say your piece on anything we've talked about tonight.

1817
02:06:53,073 --> 02:06:57,316
[SPEAKER_06]: AkumaJP said something on Twitter, said that it means boss, cat boss.

1818
02:06:58,077 --> 02:06:59,218
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, AkumaJP.

1819
02:06:59,258 --> 02:07:02,681
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm so glad he's still listening, even though JustinTV hasn't been around for a while.

1820
02:07:03,121 --> 02:07:05,143
[SPEAKER_09]: He's like the ambassador we need right now.

1821
02:07:06,684 --> 02:07:10,269
[SPEAKER_09]: Plus, did you notice his little icon is him looking up just like Obama would?

1822
02:07:12,692 --> 02:07:13,433
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, AkumaJP.

1823
02:07:15,655 --> 02:07:23,319
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's get to a couple more stories and then we'll get to the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR for some stories.

1824
02:07:26,161 --> 02:07:35,386
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's talk something else about... Let's see, we've got the possibility of a new DS on the horizon, which is interesting.

1825
02:07:35,666 --> 02:07:41,850
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a rumor that the new NVIDIA Tegra chip is going into the next generation DS system.

1826
02:07:43,393 --> 02:07:43,974
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1827
02:08:01,616 --> 02:08:02,237
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1828
02:08:29,978 --> 02:08:31,458
[SPEAKER_08]: Not next year, but the year after.

1829
02:08:33,079 --> 02:08:33,399
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

1830
02:08:33,499 --> 02:08:34,099
[SPEAKER_08]: It's interesting.

1831
02:08:34,939 --> 02:08:38,000
[SPEAKER_08]: It'd be interesting to see them being on the cutting edge of portable systems.

1832
02:08:39,241 --> 02:08:41,621
[SPEAKER_08]: Since their systems usually kind of... I don't know.

1833
02:08:42,201 --> 02:08:42,682
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, let's see.

1834
02:08:42,802 --> 02:08:46,203
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, their last system was emulating Nintendo 64 games.

1835
02:08:46,223 --> 02:08:49,263
[SPEAKER_09]: So this next handheld system should be like a GameCube in my pocket.

1836
02:08:49,504 --> 02:08:49,684
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1837
02:08:50,384 --> 02:08:50,824
[SPEAKER_09]: Amazing.

1838
02:08:52,594 --> 02:08:53,135
[SPEAKER_09]: Wait, what'd you say?

1839
02:08:53,155 --> 02:09:00,901
[SPEAKER_06]: They just posted again to all of us saying, say, really, I can't believe it, kind people, I'm impressed, and great name, thank you.

1840
02:09:02,622 --> 02:09:03,944
[SPEAKER_02]: So they like President Cat.

1841
02:09:04,604 --> 02:09:05,385
[SPEAKER_09]: I like it too.

1842
02:09:06,886 --> 02:09:08,107
[SPEAKER_09]: Chat room, quick poll.

1843
02:09:08,427 --> 02:09:11,490
[SPEAKER_09]: Who would buy a game called President Cat?

1844
02:09:12,631 --> 02:09:16,814
[SPEAKER_08]: And as soon as that game comes, I'm taking a picture of my cat holding the game.

1845
02:09:17,515 --> 02:09:19,336
[SPEAKER_06]: We need to take a picture of Shermie with it too.

1846
02:09:21,454 --> 02:09:37,905
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm telling you, we are going to flood these people with USA love because what we're doing, this poor girl or guy does not know what they're in for because we're going to flood them with this stuff so they can take it to their people and say, look, the US is crazy about President Cat.

1847
02:09:38,526 --> 02:09:39,446
[SPEAKER_09]: We need to get them.

1848
02:09:39,706 --> 02:09:41,568
[SPEAKER_09]: And then they'll be like, what's President Cat?

1849
02:09:46,973 --> 02:09:48,274
[SPEAKER_06]: This show is the win.

1850
02:09:49,796 --> 02:09:52,898
[SPEAKER_06]: Rob, when you put this show up, subtitle it President Cat.

1851
02:09:52,918 --> 02:09:54,099
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not even going to put a description.

1852
02:09:54,119 --> 02:09:57,581
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to say, sorry, this show was dominated by President Cat.

1853
02:09:59,023 --> 02:10:01,004
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyhow, let's see.

1854
02:10:01,324 --> 02:10:03,286
[SPEAKER_09]: Quick response to our poll in chat room.

1855
02:10:03,666 --> 02:10:15,149
[SPEAKER_09]: Do want, arrow pointing at name, I would, yo, I will, stuff on my president cat, I would, now, 10 copies, I would, my cat wants it, I will buy 100 copies.

1856
02:10:15,549 --> 02:10:17,769
[SPEAKER_09]: Giovedea is buying copies for her cats.

1857
02:10:18,410 --> 02:10:22,190
[SPEAKER_09]: I haven't even played my Wii in over a year, but if I can get this game, I'll break that trend.

1858
02:10:22,711 --> 02:10:24,591
[SPEAKER_09]: And my favorite, from M.A.

1859
02:10:24,631 --> 02:10:28,292
[SPEAKER_09]: Satsuma, president cat is purr-fect.

1860
02:10:31,403 --> 02:10:32,404
[SPEAKER_06]: That's beautiful.

1861
02:10:32,864 --> 02:10:42,110
[SPEAKER_06]: And you know what I'm just hoping, though, is that I'm hoping that at least this game isn't all, like, written, that there's, like, vocal track with it, because then I could play it.

1862
02:10:42,571 --> 02:10:45,813
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I read, like, seriously, I read like a five-year-old.

1863
02:10:46,393 --> 02:10:47,994
[SPEAKER_06]: I know my numbers in a few other countries.

1864
02:10:48,014 --> 02:10:48,995
[SPEAKER_08]: I just love the action.

1865
02:10:49,455 --> 02:10:51,017
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just worried the game sucks.

1866
02:10:51,317 --> 02:10:52,978
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't care at this point.

1867
02:10:52,998 --> 02:10:53,778
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't care.

1868
02:10:55,340 --> 02:10:56,100
[SPEAKER_08]: It doesn't matter.

1869
02:10:57,301 --> 02:10:58,542
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll get this!

1870
02:10:59,605 --> 02:11:00,105
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh-oh, what?

1871
02:11:01,006 --> 02:11:07,030
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, uh, Rina, uh, PodCulture, uh, Brad, Brad just became Rina Wee's 100th follower.

1872
02:11:08,110 --> 02:11:09,831
[SPEAKER_06]: We doubled their followership.

1873
02:11:13,954 --> 02:11:15,295
[SPEAKER_09]: I love this show.

1874
02:11:15,955 --> 02:11:17,716
[SPEAKER_09]: Some days I hate it, today I love it.

1875
02:11:17,896 --> 02:11:18,837
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, seriously, okay?

1876
02:11:19,557 --> 02:11:22,239
[SPEAKER_08]: Wii Music was put out by Nintendo.

1877
02:11:23,300 --> 02:11:23,900
[SPEAKER_08]: Sucked balls.

1878
02:11:25,901 --> 02:11:26,161
[SPEAKER_08]: Why?

1879
02:11:26,602 --> 02:11:28,463
[SPEAKER_08]: Because it did not have a cat playing the piano.

1880
02:11:29,755 --> 02:11:30,356
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm sorry.

1881
02:11:31,016 --> 02:11:31,677
[SPEAKER_08]: It doesn't matter.

1882
02:11:32,017 --> 02:11:33,118
[SPEAKER_08]: The game is going to be awesome.

1883
02:11:33,218 --> 02:11:37,162
[SPEAKER_08]: And yes, I understand it's no Metroid Prime.

1884
02:11:37,222 --> 02:11:39,284
[SPEAKER_08]: It's no Conduit or whatever.

1885
02:11:39,344 --> 02:11:41,126
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not even a Super Mario Galaxy.

1886
02:11:41,186 --> 02:11:41,746
[SPEAKER_08]: But you know what?

1887
02:11:42,647 --> 02:11:45,470
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a motherfucking cat playing a motherfucking piano.

1888
02:11:45,510 --> 02:11:46,310
[SPEAKER_08]: What else do you need?

1889
02:11:47,151 --> 02:11:52,256
[SPEAKER_08]: They have games out there based on Moomin, which is like some... I don't even know what it is.

1890
02:11:52,296 --> 02:11:54,358
[SPEAKER_08]: It's some character from Europe somewhere.

1891
02:11:55,319 --> 02:11:55,639
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just...

1892
02:11:57,957 --> 02:11:58,641
[SPEAKER_08]: We need this game.

1893
02:11:59,064 --> 02:11:59,466
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sorry.

1894
02:11:59,506 --> 02:11:59,908
[SPEAKER_08]: We need this game.

1895
02:11:59,929 --> 02:12:00,069
[SPEAKER_08]: I agree.

1896
02:12:00,089 --> 02:12:00,411
[SPEAKER_09]: We need it.

1897
02:12:01,196 --> 02:12:01,558
[SPEAKER_09]: We need it.

1898
02:12:02,659 --> 02:12:02,939
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1899
02:12:04,320 --> 02:12:08,884
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyhow, one more story for you guys, then we're going to open up the Skype line, and I can't wait to get to the calls tonight.

1900
02:12:09,725 --> 02:12:11,847
[SPEAKER_09]: Castlevania, The Adventure Rebirth.

1901
02:12:11,907 --> 02:12:13,568
[SPEAKER_09]: More information has been announced.

1902
02:12:13,788 --> 02:12:15,389
[SPEAKER_09]: This is a game, of course, heading to WiiWare.

1903
02:12:15,429 --> 02:12:16,771
[SPEAKER_09]: Tonight's been a Wii-heavy show.

1904
02:12:16,871 --> 02:12:21,294
[SPEAKER_09]: We haven't had a lot of Nintendo news in a long time, but yes, of course, Castlevania Adventure Rebirth.

1905
02:12:21,374 --> 02:12:23,856
[SPEAKER_09]: This was one of the games that was spoiled from the ESRB database.

1906
02:12:24,217 --> 02:12:24,897
[SPEAKER_09]: It is true.

1907
02:12:25,277 --> 02:12:28,220
[SPEAKER_09]: Konami hasn't really announced it, but we know it's true because you know what?

1908
02:12:28,300 --> 02:12:30,582
[SPEAKER_09]: It showed up in a magazine this week in Japan.

1909
02:12:30,942 --> 02:12:33,344
[SPEAKER_09]: It's coming out October 27th for 1,000 Wii Points.

1910
02:12:34,184 --> 02:12:37,266
[SPEAKER_09]: And hopefully it's going to come here in time, maybe for Halloween.

1911
02:12:37,286 --> 02:12:38,347
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what they're thinking at this point.

1912
02:12:38,387 --> 02:12:39,668
[SPEAKER_09]: It's coming out in Japan at this time.

1913
02:12:39,948 --> 02:12:41,509
[SPEAKER_09]: It looks very sexy.

1914
02:12:41,730 --> 02:12:44,371
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a Game Boy game originally, but they just completely remade it.

1915
02:12:44,431 --> 02:12:45,192
[SPEAKER_09]: It's now in color.

1916
02:12:45,532 --> 02:12:48,854
[SPEAKER_09]: It looks a little more to me like the 16-bit era.

1917
02:12:48,874 --> 02:12:51,076
[SPEAKER_09]: It looks like the Castlevania 4, Super Castlevania 4.

1918
02:12:51,416 --> 02:12:51,797
[SPEAKER_09]: But like...

1919
02:12:52,997 --> 02:12:53,758
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

1920
02:12:53,838 --> 02:12:55,219
[SPEAKER_09]: This is going to be cool.

1921
02:12:55,399 --> 02:12:58,501
[SPEAKER_09]: It will have new arrangements of classic Castlevania music.

1922
02:12:58,661 --> 02:12:58,901
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes!

1923
02:12:59,822 --> 02:13:05,245
[SPEAKER_09]: And like the other Rebirth games that they did, they are going for a faithful 16-bit look.

1924
02:13:06,126 --> 02:13:08,727
[SPEAKER_09]: What are you screaming laughing about there, DarkSakura?

1925
02:13:08,947 --> 02:13:16,992
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm just looking at all of the last 50 followers of Reno E. And it's all of us.

1926
02:13:17,793 --> 02:13:18,213
[SPEAKER_09]: I love it.

1927
02:13:18,353 --> 02:13:18,754
[SPEAKER_09]: I love it.

1928
02:13:20,355 --> 02:13:20,615
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyhow.

1929
02:13:21,789 --> 02:13:22,470
[SPEAKER_09]: Can we move on?

1930
02:13:23,250 --> 02:13:25,132
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm sorry, this is fantastic.

1931
02:13:25,312 --> 02:13:26,412
[SPEAKER_09]: No, it's funny.

1932
02:13:27,673 --> 02:13:33,638
[SPEAKER_09]: Tonight has just been a very special show, and it's about to get more specialer, as if there was such a thing.

1933
02:13:33,658 --> 02:13:38,882
[SPEAKER_09]: 1-877-GAME-OLR is the Skype line, or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

1934
02:13:39,502 --> 02:13:40,363
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's get to the calls.

1935
02:13:40,423 --> 02:13:41,364
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1936
02:13:41,384 --> 02:13:41,764
[SPEAKER_09]: Who's this?

1937
02:13:42,785 --> 02:13:44,746
[SPEAKER_11]: This is DSMaster26.

1938
02:13:44,806 --> 02:13:49,690
[SPEAKER_09]: DSMaster, we're asking everybody tonight, President Cat, is it awesome or are we overdoing it?

1939
02:13:50,210 --> 02:13:51,071
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, I would buy it.

1940
02:13:52,092 --> 02:13:52,552
[SPEAKER_09]: I would too.

1941
02:13:52,812 --> 02:13:53,693
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, what's on your mind tonight?

1942
02:13:55,754 --> 02:13:57,575
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh shit, Skype crashed again.

1943
02:13:58,935 --> 02:14:00,136
[SPEAKER_09]: Son of a bitch.

1944
02:14:01,216 --> 02:14:02,897
[SPEAKER_09]: Skype did that last week too, didn't it?

1945
02:14:03,637 --> 02:14:04,398
[SPEAKER_09]: Bad Skype.

1946
02:14:05,598 --> 02:14:15,343
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, well, this is when this is one of those rare cases where we will actually call somebody back because he did get through fair and square so we're gonna call him.

1947
02:14:16,703 --> 02:14:19,084
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know what the hell Skype did this last week too, remember?

1948
02:14:19,484 --> 02:14:20,285
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just being retarded.

1949
02:14:21,638 --> 02:14:22,998
[SPEAKER_09]: TigerClaw asks if I've updated it.

1950
02:14:23,038 --> 02:14:23,339
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what?

1951
02:14:23,359 --> 02:14:26,959
[SPEAKER_09]: I probably haven't, especially not tonight because we ran in studio very late tonight.

1952
02:14:27,219 --> 02:14:28,340
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, DSMaster, are you back?

1953
02:14:29,500 --> 02:14:30,480
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, sorry.

1954
02:14:30,580 --> 02:14:32,061
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it's something with my PSP.

1955
02:14:32,121 --> 02:14:33,281
[SPEAKER_11]: No, no, it's us.

1956
02:14:33,321 --> 02:14:35,601
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm going to try to log in to my 3000 call you.

1957
02:14:35,782 --> 02:14:36,082
[SPEAKER_09]: Hello?

1958
02:14:36,562 --> 02:14:37,362
[SPEAKER_09]: DSMaster, it's us.

1959
02:14:37,602 --> 02:14:38,562
[SPEAKER_09]: Skype crashed on our end.

1960
02:14:39,542 --> 02:14:40,003
[SPEAKER_09]: What's on your mind?

1961
02:14:40,023 --> 02:14:40,703
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, it's your end?

1962
02:14:40,783 --> 02:14:41,423
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, it was our end.

1963
02:14:41,463 --> 02:14:42,123
[SPEAKER_09]: What's on your mind tonight?

1964
02:14:43,883 --> 02:14:47,684
[SPEAKER_11]: Not much other than I will buy President Cat when it comes out.

1965
02:14:47,704 --> 02:14:47,984
[SPEAKER_11]: Me too.

1966
02:14:50,714 --> 02:14:59,279
[SPEAKER_11]: Other than that, I'm here to review... My friend got an early copy of 16 Empress.

1967
02:14:59,739 --> 02:15:00,499
[SPEAKER_09]: Please, go for it.

1968
02:15:01,640 --> 02:15:02,660
[SPEAKER_09]: It's epic.

1969
02:15:03,301 --> 02:15:04,321
[SPEAKER_09]: Tell us a little bit about the game.

1970
02:15:04,701 --> 02:15:09,384
[SPEAKER_09]: Tell us a little bit about the game for those that don't know, because remember, not everybody that listens to this show is from the Bomani days.

1971
02:15:11,025 --> 02:15:16,888
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, we were kind of thinking, since this is going to be the last Beatmania for PS2, we might as well get it.

1972
02:15:18,035 --> 02:15:43,165
[SPEAKER_11]: and of course I don't have the phone of cash lying around so my friend bought it and so he showed me some videos and whatever and I thought this was kind of cool and now with DJ Hero coming out, the question is is that going to be the competition in Konami to run for their money along with Scratch DJ?

1973
02:15:43,465 --> 02:15:45,406
[SPEAKER_11]: Do you think this is going to

1974
02:15:45,848 --> 02:15:48,838
[SPEAKER_11]: you know, blow off the Beatmania fans to go get

1975
02:15:49,721 --> 02:15:52,963
[SPEAKER_11]: The two games really aren't competing against each other.

1976
02:15:53,003 --> 02:15:55,705
[SPEAKER_09]: I know a lot of the Bonnie community wants to think it is, but they're really not.

1977
02:16:17,811 --> 02:16:26,373
[SPEAKER_11]: Because we all know that DJ Hero will come out in Japan soon, because Guitar Hero is out in Japan, I mean, as far as the on-tour games, as far as I know.

1978
02:16:26,833 --> 02:16:28,173
[SPEAKER_09]: That would be true, I'll give you that.

1979
02:16:29,714 --> 02:16:35,955
[SPEAKER_11]: And some of me is thinking, this is the competition for the guitar freaks, drum manias, and especially with rock band out there now, too.

1980
02:16:35,975 --> 02:16:40,496
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, Konami tried Rock Revolution, that was a crapshoot, as we all know.

1981
02:16:42,116 --> 02:16:46,197
[SPEAKER_11]: And this, I think, may be their final nail in the coffin.

1982
02:16:47,503 --> 02:16:58,126
[SPEAKER_08]: It doesn't say when it's going to be out over there, but it says October 2009 is the release date for DJ Hero over there, so it very well could be coming out around the same time, although, I don't know.

1983
02:16:59,647 --> 02:17:03,568
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, well, DS Master, do you have anything else quickly before we let you go?

1984
02:17:03,588 --> 02:17:15,812
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, other than to say, I give 16 Empress, you know, since I'm a factor, it's probably the last beat me for the PS2, because I'm waiting for a PS3 launch before I actually buy one of those consoles.

1985
02:17:17,172 --> 02:17:17,252
[SPEAKER_11]: Um,

1986
02:17:17,950 --> 02:17:22,592
[SPEAKER_11]: I, it's, in the point of President Cat, it's purr-fect.

1987
02:17:22,813 --> 02:17:24,133
[SPEAKER_09]: It is purr-fect.

1988
02:17:24,233 --> 02:17:25,694
[SPEAKER_09]: And Skype just crashed again.

1989
02:17:26,034 --> 02:17:26,915
[SPEAKER_09]: So if you can hear me.

1990
02:17:27,075 --> 02:17:27,195
[SPEAKER_09]: Hello?

1991
02:17:27,755 --> 02:17:27,915
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1992
02:17:29,216 --> 02:17:30,616
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, Skype crashed again.

1993
02:17:30,797 --> 02:17:33,658
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know what the hell is going on tonight, but Skype crashed again.

1994
02:17:34,198 --> 02:17:36,880
[SPEAKER_09]: So, sorry to DSMaster26, but at least he got his thoughts out.

1995
02:17:37,260 --> 02:17:39,481
[SPEAKER_09]: So, live radio, unfortunately, this kind of stuff's gonna happen.

1996
02:17:39,681 --> 02:17:40,882
[SPEAKER_04]: We got another reply from Rena Wee.

1997
02:17:41,222 --> 02:17:41,682
[SPEAKER_09]: What happened now?

1998
02:17:41,702 --> 02:17:43,583
[SPEAKER_04]: She says she is a bit of the queen type.

1999
02:17:44,554 --> 02:17:45,474
[SPEAKER_09]: So maybe it's Queen Cat?

2000
02:17:45,494 --> 02:17:46,195
[SPEAKER_04]: Queen Cat.

2001
02:17:46,915 --> 02:17:49,876
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know if Queen... I think President Cat has a better ring to it.

2002
02:17:49,936 --> 02:17:50,736
[SPEAKER_06]: Or Boss Cat.

2003
02:17:50,996 --> 02:17:51,636
[SPEAKER_09]: Or Boss Cat?

2004
02:17:51,956 --> 02:17:53,677
[SPEAKER_06]: The boss of the cats in the house.

2005
02:17:53,717 --> 02:17:54,517
[SPEAKER_09]: Almost like Top Cat.

2006
02:17:54,737 --> 02:17:57,638
[SPEAKER_09]: But if you saw these games on the shelf, which one would jump out to you?

2007
02:17:57,738 --> 02:17:59,819
[SPEAKER_09]: I think President Cat would jump out to you.

2008
02:18:00,099 --> 02:18:01,599
[SPEAKER_09]: That shows a little bit of the U.S.

2009
02:18:01,799 --> 02:18:02,920
[SPEAKER_09]: flair to it, right?

2010
02:18:03,560 --> 02:18:05,100
[SPEAKER_09]: Because in Japan, they don't have a president.

2011
02:18:05,140 --> 02:18:06,381
[SPEAKER_09]: They have a prime minister, correct?

2012
02:18:07,221 --> 02:18:12,943
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, but I think that if it comes to representing the game, because you're not actually being a president president, but, you know.

2013
02:18:13,243 --> 02:18:13,463
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway.

2014
02:18:13,871 --> 02:18:14,531
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, this is Ray Iannami.

2015
02:18:14,571 --> 02:18:15,412
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry, I thought it held up.

2016
02:18:36,334 --> 02:18:41,277
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm gonna have been, I just didn't really join until Part B since I was busy with homework and such.

2017
02:18:41,657 --> 02:18:43,618
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, okay, well then we'll give you a bye.

2018
02:18:43,658 --> 02:18:44,598
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, what's on your mind tonight?

2019
02:18:46,920 --> 02:18:53,063
[SPEAKER_10]: So, I've been looking at the 2D shooters, like, this decade, and I've been noticing a recent trend.

2020
02:18:53,083 --> 02:18:58,786
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, they need to have, like, a bullet hell shooter with lots of cutesy enemy characters.

2021
02:18:59,386 --> 02:19:03,768
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's kind of getting me worried about the 2D shooter genre.

2022
02:19:04,569 --> 02:19:04,829
[SPEAKER_13]: Mm-hmm.

2023
02:19:08,174 --> 02:19:33,489
[SPEAKER_10]: This means that more traditional shooters with starship characters are being phased out and I have friends who are mostly into stuff like Toho and Strike Witches and Death's Mouth and all those other moe it, moe it shooters and I have a feeling that if I were to show them something like Archive or Thunder Force they'd probably say no.

2024
02:19:34,794 --> 02:19:37,536
[SPEAKER_10]: and one offer them playing whatever they want.

2025
02:19:37,636 --> 02:19:48,484
[SPEAKER_10]: It makes you realize in the future if all you're ever going to see a shooter is going to be nothing but cutesy bullet hole shooters that are all like copping topics of each other.

2026
02:19:50,365 --> 02:19:51,826
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's say you were a game designer.

2027
02:19:51,987 --> 02:19:54,388
[SPEAKER_09]: What would you do to make a 2D shooter interesting?

2028
02:19:58,992 --> 02:20:03,315
[SPEAKER_10]: Interesting as in like get people to imitate

2029
02:20:05,117 --> 02:20:11,982
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, if I was making a shooter that was more of the aforementioned traditional shooter, like, how to make it more interesting?

2030
02:20:14,304 --> 02:20:15,025
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sorry, I missed that.

2031
02:20:15,065 --> 02:20:15,265
[SPEAKER_09]: What?

2032
02:20:17,587 --> 02:20:21,209
[SPEAKER_10]: What do you mean by how to make a shooter interesting?

2033
02:20:21,509 --> 02:20:30,997
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I know... Like, because, you know, you kind of are saying that a lot of the games are kind of copies of each other, so what would you do to kind of break the mold?

2034
02:20:33,479 --> 02:20:33,819
[SPEAKER_10]: Hmm...

2035
02:20:35,069 --> 02:20:51,394
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, as I mentioned, I want to make more shooters that don't have lots of worlds, but something that makes the game challenging, other than really pretty board patterns.

2036
02:20:51,595 --> 02:20:55,716
[SPEAKER_10]: Something that's more of a comeback to a more traditional sort of graduate rebirth.

2037
02:20:57,421 --> 02:21:00,122
[SPEAKER_09]: Gradius Rebirth is pretty cool.

2038
02:21:00,142 --> 02:21:02,603
[SPEAKER_09]: I like these Rebirth series that Konami's doing recently.

2039
02:21:02,623 --> 02:21:05,104
[SPEAKER_09]: Did you just hear us talking about Castlevania Rebirth?

2040
02:21:06,645 --> 02:21:07,365
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I did.

2041
02:21:07,845 --> 02:21:08,465
[SPEAKER_09]: What do you think of that?

2042
02:21:08,505 --> 02:21:09,186
[SPEAKER_09]: Is that going to be interesting?

2043
02:21:09,206 --> 02:21:11,847
[SPEAKER_09]: I know it's not a shooter, but I figure you're a fan of that series too.

2044
02:21:13,127 --> 02:21:16,428
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I'm a Castlevania fan too.

2045
02:21:16,889 --> 02:21:22,951
[SPEAKER_10]: I've played most of the Metroidvania and some of the older Castlevania games.

2046
02:21:25,126 --> 02:21:26,087
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm going to give it a shot.

2047
02:21:26,127 --> 02:21:32,055
[SPEAKER_10]: It depends on what element it decides to borrow from past games.

2048
02:21:32,075 --> 02:21:33,777
[SPEAKER_09]: Take care, buddy.

2049
02:21:44,580 --> 02:21:47,502
[SPEAKER_09]: 1-877-GAME-OLR, username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

2050
02:21:48,182 --> 02:21:49,863
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to take your calls right now.

2051
02:21:49,883 --> 02:21:52,505
[SPEAKER_09]: And, of course, we are polling all the callers tonight about President Cat.

2052
02:21:53,465 --> 02:21:54,346
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

2053
02:21:54,366 --> 02:21:54,726
[SPEAKER_09]: Who's this?

2054
02:21:56,247 --> 02:21:57,548
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi, this is Spazinator.

2055
02:21:57,568 --> 02:21:58,328
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, Spazinator.

2056
02:21:58,348 --> 02:21:58,928
[SPEAKER_09]: How you doing?

2057
02:22:00,429 --> 02:22:01,850
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, pretty good.

2058
02:22:01,890 --> 02:22:04,531
[SPEAKER_10]: How's everything over in President Catland?

2059
02:22:04,731 --> 02:22:05,992
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, wonderful.

2060
02:22:06,032 --> 02:22:11,055
[SPEAKER_09]: And we have to ask you, are you interested in buying President Cat or are we making too big of a deal out of it?

2061
02:22:12,698 --> 02:22:16,641
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, I might get it, assuming that I ever do get a Wii.

2062
02:22:17,402 --> 02:22:25,588
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, you know, the Wii's only, you know, our current console, our current console I don't have yet, but I may get a Wii just for President Cat.

2063
02:22:25,949 --> 02:22:27,250
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, I'm just going to put you down to see yes.

2064
02:22:27,650 --> 02:22:29,171
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, uh, what's on your mind tonight?

2065
02:22:30,632 --> 02:22:38,018
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, yeah, I don't know if you saw one of my earlier tweets today before your show went live, but, um, I had asked, uh,

2066
02:22:39,580 --> 02:22:46,202
[SPEAKER_10]: The three of you, if you have seen Detuned on the PlayStation Network store yet.

2067
02:22:46,322 --> 02:22:49,223
[SPEAKER_09]: I have not seen this, but I know you were tweeting some things about it.

2068
02:22:49,263 --> 02:22:50,044
[SPEAKER_09]: What's this all about?

2069
02:22:52,244 --> 02:23:04,889
[SPEAKER_10]: It simply puts like a cross between Lingering Shadows, which has been on the store for forever, and Music Visualizer, so

2070
02:23:07,023 --> 02:23:12,847
[SPEAKER_10]: It's kind of both or two things together and that's what Detuned is.

2071
02:23:13,828 --> 02:23:19,832
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not actually a game, it's like part art, part music visualizer.

2072
02:23:20,173 --> 02:23:27,858
[SPEAKER_10]: And like any other game, like a game for the PS3, it also has trophies.

2073
02:23:28,779 --> 02:23:35,404
[SPEAKER_10]: So if you're kind of like bored of your music visualizers on the PS3,

2074
02:23:36,864 --> 02:23:41,087
[SPEAKER_10]: and, you know, you need something else to look at.

2075
02:23:41,307 --> 02:23:46,930
[SPEAKER_10]: If you're a trophy whore, then I suggest getting it detuned.

2076
02:23:46,990 --> 02:23:48,291
[SPEAKER_09]: Is there a demo that I can check out?

2077
02:23:50,612 --> 02:23:57,457
[SPEAKER_10]: Not yet, but I would imagine that probably they may come up with one soon.

2078
02:23:58,137 --> 02:23:59,578
[SPEAKER_10]: When exactly, I don't know.

2079
02:24:00,967 --> 02:24:04,430
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm trying to see if maybe there's like a YouTube or something I can kind of check out here.

2080
02:24:05,951 --> 02:24:11,415
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm looking, I actually just loaded up somebody's video that looks like they shot their TV to show this game.

2081
02:24:12,155 --> 02:24:14,597
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm trying to look at a little bit of the game in action here.

2082
02:24:14,977 --> 02:24:16,178
[SPEAKER_09]: So I can kind of see what it looks like.

2083
02:24:17,259 --> 02:24:20,361
[SPEAKER_09]: But this looks like a very... Oh, this looks crazy.

2084
02:24:21,422 --> 02:24:26,486
[SPEAKER_09]: Dude, there's like elephant... Maybe President Cat needs to go to PlayStation Network.

2085
02:24:26,526 --> 02:24:28,247
[SPEAKER_09]: Seriously, if this game's on it, I don't know.

2086
02:24:30,171 --> 02:24:57,091
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, uh, and also, um, the only thing I mentioned in the same tweet is that I know you kind of talked on it earlier, and I know you're not exactly that action-y, platform-y type of gamer, but, you know, um, Uncharted 2 is, uh, one of the more recent games that I got, and I swear to God, it is pretty good, um,

2087
02:24:59,095 --> 02:25:22,112
[SPEAKER_10]: and um you know you know you know if you like um you know the Indiana Jones type type of uh stuff you know you know I would suggest getting it um you know you know you're seeing that uh every uh you know major company out there that does uh

2088
02:25:22,609 --> 02:25:24,930
[SPEAKER_10]: The reviews gave it basically perfect.

2089
02:25:25,170 --> 02:25:25,730
[SPEAKER_09]: I know, I saw it.

2090
02:25:26,211 --> 02:25:27,871
[SPEAKER_09]: The reviews are nothing but positive.

2091
02:25:27,911 --> 02:25:29,072
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sure the game's great.

2092
02:25:29,152 --> 02:25:30,892
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just, you know, I don't usually play those type of games.

2093
02:25:31,173 --> 02:25:34,394
[SPEAKER_09]: But I probably will check it out right after I get President Cat, okay?

2094
02:25:35,694 --> 02:25:35,935
[SPEAKER_09]: Sure.

2095
02:25:36,195 --> 02:25:36,455
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

2096
02:25:36,975 --> 02:25:37,675
[SPEAKER_09]: Take care, buddy.

2097
02:25:37,715 --> 02:25:39,076
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to let you go so we can get some more calls.

2098
02:25:39,156 --> 02:25:39,616
[SPEAKER_09]: Have a good one.

2099
02:25:39,636 --> 02:25:41,797
[SPEAKER_09]: I have to hear that.

2100
02:25:41,817 --> 02:25:43,618
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, you too.

2101
02:25:43,658 --> 02:25:43,938
[SPEAKER_09]: Later.

2102
02:25:43,958 --> 02:25:44,658
[SPEAKER_09]: 1877 Game OLR.

2103
02:25:44,678 --> 02:25:45,659
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

2104
02:25:45,679 --> 02:25:46,079
[SPEAKER_09]: Who's this?

2105
02:25:46,859 --> 02:25:47,759
[SPEAKER_00]: It's Legend of Zaku.

2106
02:25:47,839 --> 02:25:49,380
[SPEAKER_09]: Zaku, you know what I'm going to ask you first.

2107
02:25:49,520 --> 02:25:51,341
[SPEAKER_09]: President Cat, yay or nay?

2108
02:25:52,714 --> 02:25:52,994
[SPEAKER_00]: DeVirginized

2109
02:26:12,006 --> 02:26:15,048
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, let's say, um, I had to fake an orgasm.

2110
02:26:15,888 --> 02:26:16,068
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.

2111
02:26:16,088 --> 02:26:17,189
[SPEAKER_06]: That's pretty standard.

2112
02:26:17,229 --> 02:26:19,150
[SPEAKER_09]: That's, yeah, I've actually seen the show in New York.

2113
02:26:19,170 --> 02:26:22,311
[SPEAKER_06]: At least you didn't have to do the, at least you didn't have to do the Twinkie or Banana Blowjob.

2114
02:26:22,732 --> 02:26:24,893
[SPEAKER_09]: Did you, uh, did you have a good time?

2115
02:26:25,593 --> 02:26:27,254
[SPEAKER_00]: It was pretty good, to be honest with you.

2116
02:26:28,114 --> 02:26:33,177
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, aside from that, I'm just, you know, just like mulling over the things.

2117
02:26:33,652 --> 02:26:39,496
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, the bullshit decision that Infinity Ward made over the weekend regarding Modern Warfare 2 PC and what's that?

2118
02:26:41,138 --> 02:26:50,885
[SPEAKER_00]: killing off dedicated servers basically making the whole game a living hell for clans and the ability to mob the hell out of it

2119
02:26:53,338 --> 02:26:55,438
[SPEAKER_09]: This seems to be a trend this year with PC games.

2120
02:26:55,538 --> 02:27:00,760
[SPEAKER_09]: The only reason why I say that is because remember what a hizzy fit everybody went into over StarCraft 2?

2121
02:27:01,121 --> 02:27:02,741
[SPEAKER_09]: You can't play on LANs right now?

2122
02:27:03,081 --> 02:27:09,184
[SPEAKER_09]: It seems like all these game companies want to centralize things on their own servers for various reasons.

2123
02:27:09,564 --> 02:27:12,065
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's not even that.

2124
02:27:12,125 --> 02:27:17,127
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just that they're introducing matchmaking as an integral part of Modern Warfare 2.

2125
02:27:17,507 --> 02:27:19,688
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, bringing it down to the level...

2126
02:27:21,220 --> 02:27:21,420
[SPEAKER_00]: XBOX 5

2127
02:27:48,439 --> 02:28:15,748
[SPEAKER_00]: and you know basically kills off any aspect of gaming playing against like more than 16 people at the same time and I mean the fact of the matter is that dedicated servers pretty much has always been the norm for PC games for the most part I mean growing up playing on like Quake 2 for example on dedicated servers and the

2128
02:28:16,636 --> 02:28:18,377
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know, I guess they're going ass-backwards.

2129
02:28:18,777 --> 02:28:23,240
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess Infinity Ward's trying to, like, being, like, regressive regarding this.

2130
02:28:23,660 --> 02:28:24,881
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's pissing off a lot of people.

2131
02:28:24,901 --> 02:28:27,362
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people are canceling their pre-orders.

2132
02:28:28,443 --> 02:28:32,425
[SPEAKER_00]: So, either that or they're being kept in the dark.

2133
02:28:34,745 --> 02:28:39,611
[SPEAKER_09]: My God, are you tearing your computer apart during the show?

2134
02:28:40,351 --> 02:28:41,733
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no, no, no, no.

2135
02:28:42,314 --> 02:28:48,160
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I was going to get Modern Warfare 2, but after reading this, I'm kind of questioning that thought.

2136
02:28:48,598 --> 02:28:51,740
[SPEAKER_00]: That notion of actually investing in that game.

2137
02:28:52,240 --> 02:28:57,043
[SPEAKER_09]: It's tough for me, Zaku, because you know Modern Warfare isn't the type of game I would usually play.

2138
02:28:57,563 --> 02:29:01,225
[SPEAKER_09]: But, you know, obviously I know it's going to be epic, especially for fans of that genre.

2139
02:29:01,245 --> 02:29:03,947
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not going to knock it because it sets trends.

2140
02:29:04,347 --> 02:29:06,949
[SPEAKER_09]: But I can see where people are getting a little irritated.

2141
02:29:07,029 --> 02:29:12,332
[SPEAKER_09]: But really, you're going to go without the game completely when it's going to be probably this year's biggest game?

2142
02:29:12,812 --> 02:29:16,914
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand that it's supposed to be Halo and all the other...

2143
02:29:18,195 --> 02:29:19,015
[SPEAKER_00]: Subtitles by the Amara.org community

2144
02:29:41,984 --> 02:29:43,486
[SPEAKER_00]: It kind of turns me off.

2145
02:29:43,906 --> 02:29:47,949
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I went through the same thing when playing Call of Duty 4 on 360.

2146
02:29:48,290 --> 02:30:01,080
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just a lot of asshattery and it just didn't feel right when I should be playing that game on my PC with a decent server where everyone at least knows who you are.

2147
02:30:02,542 --> 02:30:02,842
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright.

2148
02:30:03,702 --> 02:30:05,944
[SPEAKER_09]: Zaku, any quick thoughts before we move on to some more calls?

2149
02:30:06,945 --> 02:30:08,907
[SPEAKER_00]: Infinity Ward needs to either

2150
02:30:09,673 --> 02:30:14,796
[SPEAKER_00]: Release more information or just like really rethink about what they just said about what they're planning to do.

2151
02:30:15,397 --> 02:30:20,720
[SPEAKER_00]: Because they already lost one sale out of probably thousands, if not millions.

2152
02:30:21,121 --> 02:30:23,262
[SPEAKER_09]: At least that's money you can invest in a present cap.

2153
02:30:23,923 --> 02:30:24,203
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

2154
02:30:24,663 --> 02:30:25,644
[SPEAKER_09]: Take care, Saku.

2155
02:30:25,664 --> 02:30:26,204
[SPEAKER_09]: Have a good night.

2156
02:30:26,905 --> 02:30:27,425
[SPEAKER_00]: Have a good one.

2157
02:30:28,078 --> 02:30:30,259
[SPEAKER_09]: Speaking of President Cat, the updates keep coming.

2158
02:30:30,299 --> 02:30:32,799
[SPEAKER_09]: They're trying to explain to us what it is.

2159
02:30:33,259 --> 02:30:36,480
[SPEAKER_09]: And basically, they tweeted us to this Google image search.

2160
02:30:36,800 --> 02:30:37,220
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, that's you.

2161
02:30:37,280 --> 02:30:38,600
[SPEAKER_09]: It shows us what the Tsukibon is.

2162
02:30:38,760 --> 02:30:39,941
[SPEAKER_09]: That was Yo-Yo Cop Girl.

2163
02:30:40,561 --> 02:30:44,162
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, that's completely mistranslated.

2164
02:30:44,182 --> 02:30:46,102
[SPEAKER_06]: Tsukibon, that's a word I knew.

2165
02:30:46,722 --> 02:30:48,783
[SPEAKER_06]: Because, like I said, it means a boss girl.

2166
02:30:48,843 --> 02:30:50,123
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's the typical look.

2167
02:30:50,303 --> 02:30:53,144
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, Rob, did you ever play Project Justice?

2168
02:30:53,404 --> 02:30:53,544
[SPEAKER_09]: No.

2169
02:30:53,724 --> 02:30:54,164
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

2170
02:30:54,864 --> 02:31:03,865
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, there's a character in that called Zaki who wore the long skirt and everything with her uniform and it's like a girl gang leader.

2171
02:31:04,855 --> 02:31:10,500
[SPEAKER_09]: So, maybe they need to call the game Mistress Cat, because these look like a mistress.

2172
02:31:10,721 --> 02:31:16,065
[SPEAKER_09]: But I just like the name President Cat, and I do want to point out, in all these pictures, look at the colors the Tsukibon are wearing.

2173
02:31:16,506 --> 02:31:18,067
[SPEAKER_09]: Red, white, and blue.

2174
02:31:18,207 --> 02:31:18,608
[SPEAKER_09]: Am I right?

2175
02:31:19,068 --> 02:31:19,469
[SPEAKER_06]: Am I right?

2176
02:31:19,489 --> 02:31:21,671
[SPEAKER_06]: That's just typical uniform colors, though.

2177
02:31:21,691 --> 02:31:24,493
[SPEAKER_09]: Coincidence or not, it's funny and adds to the cause.

2178
02:31:24,533 --> 02:31:25,614
[SPEAKER_09]: I still like the name President Cat.

2179
02:31:25,734 --> 02:31:29,017
[SPEAKER_06]: At any rate, I think the best way to describe the title of the game, because...

2180
02:31:29,898 --> 02:31:35,000
[SPEAKER_06]: It's basically, we've been going, and I said, oh, she controls the house, and they were going, no, she controls the office.

2181
02:31:35,060 --> 02:31:42,283
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think it's like, she is sort of like the real leader of the office, you know what I mean?

2182
02:31:42,323 --> 02:31:44,164
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, Shermie's the real princess of the house.

2183
02:31:45,184 --> 02:31:48,645
[SPEAKER_06]: She inserts her own control over the house.

2184
02:31:48,805 --> 02:31:51,566
[SPEAKER_09]: More calls at 1-877-GAME-OLR.

2185
02:31:52,047 --> 02:31:54,247
[SPEAKER_09]: Loki, do you have any last minute stories?

2186
02:31:54,287 --> 02:31:55,528
[SPEAKER_09]: I see you looking at something about...

2187
02:31:55,848 --> 02:31:59,312
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, I was just doing a search for the cat thing, and there's someone talking about it.

2188
02:31:59,332 --> 02:32:00,653
[SPEAKER_08]: They thought it was a Dreamcast game.

2189
02:32:01,013 --> 02:32:04,617
[SPEAKER_08]: It's the NTSC-UK forums.

2190
02:32:05,278 --> 02:32:06,239
[SPEAKER_08]: We're talking about the cat game.

2191
02:32:06,259 --> 02:32:12,305
[SPEAKER_08]: They call it the Dreamcast cat game because it has a little Dreamcast swirl on it.

2192
02:32:12,325 --> 02:32:13,466
[SPEAKER_04]: Spirals on our cheeks for the blush.

2193
02:32:13,486 --> 02:32:15,988
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, did you respond and say it's fucking President Cat?

2194
02:32:16,028 --> 02:32:16,629
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, salute.

2195
02:32:17,737 --> 02:32:18,498
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I didn't say that.

2196
02:32:18,758 --> 02:32:30,965
[SPEAKER_08]: However, I did notice that there was someone that posted on the GameFAQs forum, the only post, I suspect, Actdeft, that said, President Cat for 2012, you know you want or something.

2197
02:32:31,745 --> 02:32:32,506
[SPEAKER_09]: I love that idea.

2198
02:32:32,606 --> 02:32:35,828
[SPEAKER_09]: Go flood the GameFAQs forums with President Cat love.

2199
02:32:37,108 --> 02:32:39,129
[SPEAKER_06]: That is the most awesome Tsukibandeka picture ever.

2200
02:32:39,469 --> 02:32:52,293
[SPEAKER_08]: And I understand that, you know, President Cat isn't necessarily what it translates into, but, you know, bossy or authoritative female cat just doesn't have the same ring as President Cat.

2201
02:32:52,313 --> 02:32:56,295
[SPEAKER_08]: And the president of a company, CEO Cat, I mean... Yeah, exactly.

2202
02:32:56,455 --> 02:32:58,055
[SPEAKER_08]: I think President Cat has the best ring to it.

2203
02:32:58,075 --> 02:32:59,816
[SPEAKER_05]: You could do Company President Cat.

2204
02:33:02,714 --> 02:33:05,522
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think we're getting any other calls Grand Empress Kat

2205
02:33:08,311 --> 02:33:08,551
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

2206
02:33:08,771 --> 02:33:10,213
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki, do you have any last-minute stories?

2207
02:33:10,473 --> 02:33:10,633
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

2208
02:33:11,794 --> 02:33:19,500
[SPEAKER_08]: So just like they did with the NHL, EA is bringing Madden NFL Arcade to Xbox Live Arcade and PlayStation Network.

2209
02:33:19,940 --> 02:33:24,885
[SPEAKER_08]: It will be a five-on-five football game with kind of like a backyard scenario.

2210
02:33:24,905 --> 02:33:29,048
[SPEAKER_08]: They say the first of 30, four plays per progression, no penalties, no field goals.

2211
02:33:29,748 --> 02:33:32,931
[SPEAKER_08]: And that will be coming for $15 sometime in December.

2212
02:33:32,951 --> 02:33:33,451
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

2213
02:33:36,454 --> 02:33:41,878
[SPEAKER_08]: Also, Nice America wants to bring Holy Invasion of Privacy Badman to UMD.

2214
02:33:42,318 --> 02:33:47,862
[SPEAKER_08]: Ironically enough, this game was originally going to come out in UMD, but for whatever reason, it got cock-blocked into download only.

2215
02:33:48,423 --> 02:33:54,968
[SPEAKER_08]: But they're looking for a thousand fans to basically promise that they're going to pre-order the game.

2216
02:33:55,628 --> 02:33:59,131
[SPEAKER_08]: And if you do that, by November 13th, they will bring out the game.

2217
02:34:00,876 --> 02:34:01,376
[SPEAKER_09]: Interesting.

2218
02:34:01,636 --> 02:34:01,936
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

2219
02:34:02,956 --> 02:34:08,718
[SPEAKER_08]: Apparently, third-party publishers are not required to release PSP games on the PlayStation Store.

2220
02:34:09,018 --> 02:34:17,520
[SPEAKER_08]: All the more reason that you have the option of buying a UMD game, and that's why you need to own a PSP 3000 and not a Go.

2221
02:34:19,780 --> 02:34:21,020
[SPEAKER_08]: You're just limiting your options.

2222
02:34:21,280 --> 02:34:29,282
[SPEAKER_08]: Finally, Borderlands, a game that hasn't even come out yet, is already getting its first bit of download content, almost kind of tying in with

2223
02:34:30,300 --> 02:34:32,642
[SPEAKER_08]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

2224
02:34:58,072 --> 02:34:59,153
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, later this year they say.

2225
02:35:00,594 --> 02:35:00,954
[SPEAKER_08]: Interesting.

2226
02:35:26,733 --> 02:35:27,614
[SPEAKER_09]: is the rumored date.

2227
02:35:28,234 --> 02:35:32,077
[SPEAKER_09]: Also, in related news, I think this was something that was briefly covered on a previous show.

2228
02:35:33,838 --> 02:35:42,684
[SPEAKER_09]: The Cleveland fan John Thompson, also known as Big Dog, had recently sued EA because EA used his likeness in Madden NFL.

2229
02:35:42,945 --> 02:35:45,947
[SPEAKER_09]: He's one of the super fans that actually dresses up as a dog for the games.

2230
02:35:46,407 --> 02:35:50,990
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I can't really explain it either, but I'm assuming if you follow football or live in Cleveland, you know what I'm talking about.

2231
02:35:52,211 --> 02:35:53,592
[SPEAKER_09]: He has settled the suit, apparently, $25,000.

2232
02:35:53,632 --> 02:35:54,012
[SPEAKER_09]: So, there you go.

2233
02:35:58,197 --> 02:36:01,059
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sorry, the suit has been settled not necessarily for $25,000.

2234
02:36:01,439 --> 02:36:05,722
[SPEAKER_09]: That is what he was seeking originally, but we don't know exactly how much it was settled for.

2235
02:36:06,083 --> 02:36:06,523
[SPEAKER_09]: So there you go.

2236
02:36:08,220 --> 02:36:10,141
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's going to do it for Last Minute Stories tonight.

2237
02:36:10,181 --> 02:36:13,082
[SPEAKER_09]: No other calls on Skype line tonight, so I guess that's it.

2238
02:36:13,122 --> 02:36:14,403
[SPEAKER_09]: We just have shy callers tonight.

2239
02:36:15,003 --> 02:36:18,945
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's going to do it, I guess, for tonight's episode of Orange Launch Radio.

2240
02:36:18,965 --> 02:36:21,306
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you guys so much for tuning in to us and supporting our show.

2241
02:36:21,627 --> 02:36:24,008
[SPEAKER_09]: I know it was a crazy-ass show tonight, but you know what?

2242
02:36:24,488 --> 02:36:24,928
[SPEAKER_09]: It was fun.

2243
02:36:25,088 --> 02:36:25,789
[SPEAKER_09]: It was a lot of fun.

2244
02:36:26,609 --> 02:36:32,552
[SPEAKER_09]: But I'm just waiting for the backlash to begin on President Cat, but you're a fool if you don't support it.

2245
02:36:34,733 --> 02:36:35,994
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts.

2246
02:36:36,014 --> 02:36:36,814
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, hey, hey, guess what?

2247
02:36:37,259 --> 02:36:38,200
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh god, more?

2248
02:36:38,480 --> 02:36:40,362
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

2249
02:36:41,302 --> 02:36:45,006
[SPEAKER_06]: Renowee says, yeah, I like to and I think President Cat is better.

2250
02:36:46,907 --> 02:36:48,188
[SPEAKER_06]: So they like President Cat.

2251
02:36:49,329 --> 02:36:53,633
[SPEAKER_06]: So now I've got a goal to make President Cat a trending topic on...

2252
02:36:55,476 --> 02:37:21,221
[SPEAKER_09]: On Twitter Good luck with that, it takes a lot It takes a lot to get a trending topic But I think the more we can show Again, I'm totally serious about Let's use our picture stream for something really useful Send in President Cat fan art Something that we can send to them So they can show people That's how this is going to happen They have to be able to prove to some American publisher That America actually wants this game And that it's not a fucking joke You know what?

2253
02:37:22,122 --> 02:37:23,662
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we need to start a Shermie blog

2254
02:37:25,583 --> 02:37:26,184
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm serious!

2255
02:37:26,204 --> 02:37:27,084
[SPEAKER_09]: Shermie needs a Twitter.

2256
02:37:27,525 --> 02:37:28,345
[SPEAKER_06]: Shermie needs a Twitter.

2257
02:37:28,686 --> 02:37:42,116
[SPEAKER_06]: Shermie's gonna be, like, well, no, you know, they have their little blog for their president, for, um, for their, uh, for Renna, yeah, who was, like, the boss cat and all the other, seriously, I was just reading this one about this other cat going, oh, you know.

2258
02:37:42,196 --> 02:37:44,978
[SPEAKER_09]: So it'll be Shermie's goal to get President Cat out in the US.

2259
02:37:45,479 --> 02:37:45,739
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

2260
02:37:46,119 --> 02:37:49,362
[SPEAKER_09]: And he, she can be, uh, Shermie can be Secretary of Fat.

2261
02:37:53,581 --> 02:37:54,442
[SPEAKER_09]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

2262
02:38:17,851 --> 02:38:19,313
[SPEAKER_09]: You haven't heard the last of President Cat.

2263
02:38:19,333 --> 02:38:22,336
[SPEAKER_09]: We finally found a cause here on Orange Lounge Radio.

2264
02:38:22,456 --> 02:38:23,877
[SPEAKER_09]: One of several causes, I'm sure.

2265
02:38:25,239 --> 02:38:27,621
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, we got one more call coming through on the Skype line.

2266
02:38:28,542 --> 02:38:29,303
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's take a call.

2267
02:38:29,603 --> 02:38:30,624
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

2268
02:38:30,664 --> 02:38:31,065
[SPEAKER_09]: Who's this?

02:38:42,657 --> 02:38:44,861
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you so much for downloading and supporting Orange Lounge Radio.

2270
02:38:44,881 --> 02:38:46,083
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, we didn't get everybody's final thought.

2271
02:38:46,103 --> 02:38:46,444
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sorry.

2272
02:38:46,864 --> 02:38:48,126
[SPEAKER_09]: Loki, your final thought.

2273
02:38:49,869 --> 02:38:54,317
[SPEAKER_08]: My final thought is... Daytona.

2274
02:38:54,978 --> 02:38:56,541
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, did you have anything else you wanted to add?

2275
02:38:59,133 --> 02:39:00,916
[SPEAKER_09]: My final thought is President Cat for 2012.

2276
02:39:01,096 --> 02:39:02,879
[SPEAKER_09]: Actually, 2010.

2277
02:39:03,160 --> 02:39:04,402
[SPEAKER_09]: We need President Cat a lot sooner.

2278
02:39:04,743 --> 02:39:08,849
[SPEAKER_09]: Governor Cat in 2010.

2279
02:39:09,070 --> 02:39:11,494
[SPEAKER_06]: We need President Cat to take over the mafia.

2280
02:39:13,129 --> 02:39:13,429
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

2281
02:39:14,370 --> 02:39:14,930
[SPEAKER_09]: That's going to do it.

2282
02:39:14,970 --> 02:39:17,613
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you guys so much for downloading and supporting Internet Radio.

2283
02:39:17,633 --> 02:39:18,673
[SPEAKER_09]: President Cat.

2284
02:39:18,693 --> 02:39:20,235
[SPEAKER_09]: President Cat, indirectly.

2285
02:39:20,575 --> 02:39:23,437
[SPEAKER_09]: Look, guys, honestly, I said it before and I meant it.

2286
02:39:23,557 --> 02:39:27,941
[SPEAKER_09]: There's millions of shows talking about Uncharted 2 this week, and we're certainly not hating on the game by any means.

2287
02:39:27,981 --> 02:39:28,681
[SPEAKER_09]: We're just like you.

2288
02:39:30,322 --> 02:39:31,123
[SPEAKER_09]: We don't get paid.

2289
02:39:31,143 --> 02:39:32,424
[SPEAKER_09]: Did somebody put that on our Twitter?

2290
02:39:32,584 --> 02:39:39,650
[SPEAKER_06]: IkumaJP put a picture of a kitten dressed up as a sukeban, so I'm going to post that on our Twitter.

2291
02:39:39,670 --> 02:39:39,990
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

2292
02:39:40,743 --> 02:39:44,224
[SPEAKER_06]: Not the Twitter, but on... Place that in chat so our chatters can see, please.

2293
02:39:44,264 --> 02:39:44,624
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

2294
02:39:44,845 --> 02:39:46,505
[SPEAKER_06]: God damn, the show's amazing tonight.

2295
02:39:46,965 --> 02:39:48,406
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, thank you guys.

2296
02:39:48,526 --> 02:39:53,128
[SPEAKER_09]: Honestly, I meant it when I said it earlier, you know, and we're certainly not hating on Uncharted 2 by any means.

2297
02:39:53,168 --> 02:39:53,748
[SPEAKER_09]: We're just like you.

2298
02:39:53,788 --> 02:39:56,389
[SPEAKER_09]: We have to pay $60 of our own money if we want to play the game.

2299
02:39:56,409 --> 02:39:59,450
[SPEAKER_09]: They don't send us this stuff for free, so we'll get to those stuff eventually.

2300
02:39:59,730 --> 02:40:02,431
[SPEAKER_09]: But seriously, what other show are you going to hear about President Cat on this week?

2301
02:40:03,652 --> 02:40:04,652
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's make it happen, guys.

2302
02:40:04,772 --> 02:40:10,036
[SPEAKER_09]: It's the OL Army, and the way you can help us out, always just tell two friends about our show and help spread the word.

2303
02:40:10,837 --> 02:40:12,198
[SPEAKER_09]: From us to you guys, thank you so much.

2304
02:40:12,338 --> 02:40:13,158
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll see you next week.

2305
02:40:13,198 --> 02:40:23,726
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll be back to do this all again, and I'm sure plenty of updates on this whole President Cat thing, and even more of gaming news, because it's just the lulzy time here at Orange Lounge Radio.

2306
02:40:23,866 --> 02:40:30,431
[SPEAKER_09]: So on behalf of myself, DarkSakra, Loki, DudeDudeDudeGuy, and President Cat, we'll see you next time.

2307
02:40:31,131 --> 02:40:33,912
[SPEAKER_07]: You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

2308
02:40:34,432 --> 02:40:37,674
[SPEAKER_07]: Orange Lounge Radio is an Orange Lounge production.

2309
02:40:38,114 --> 02:40:46,777
[SPEAKER_07]: To join us for a live show, visit www.allgames.com Sunday nights at 6pm Pacific Time.

2310
02:40:47,258 --> 02:40:58,862
[SPEAKER_07]: The views and opinions expressed on Orange Lounge Radio do not necessarily reflect those of the entire staff of Orange Lounge Radio or allgames.com, but we're probably right anyway.

2311
02:40:59,443 --> 02:41:00,243
[SPEAKER_07]: See you next week!

2312
02:41:02,078 --> 02:41:03,065
Thanks for watching!
