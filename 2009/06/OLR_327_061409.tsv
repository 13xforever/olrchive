0	20240	Today, June 14th, 2009. Could you soon use a turntable in Guitar Hero? Is Project Natal
20240	24960	actually a new Xbox console? And if one creator has his way, what video game might be the
24960	33880	next great sport? Orange Lounge Radio. Hello, everybody out there on the Internet, and welcome
33880	42480	to another week of Orange Lounge Radio, taping June the 14th, 2009. My name is Rob Roberts.
42480	46440	Joining me not tonight is the one and only Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers. She's actually
46440	51340	around. She didn't go on a vacation or anything, but she had school orientation some tonight
51340	55960	for her class, or I don't know what all's going on there, but I know she's school-related.
55960	60440	She'll be joining us partway through the show, hopefully. She's anticipating she'll be here
60440	66120	about 8.15 Pacific, which usually our show's still taping by 8.30, 8.45, so she should
66120	70400	be here for the very, very end. But that's all right. We've still got Tech Master Loki
70400	76160	here tonight. Yes, I'm here. The very busy Tech Master Loki. Yes, I'm moving. Yes, you've
76160	83000	been moving lately. How's that going? Sucks. Yeah? Yeah. But I don't know if the listeners
83000	87680	are aware, but you actually moved from an apartment to your house. Not a rented house,
87680	92160	but one you have actually purchased. Yes. In this very sad economy, you were actually
92160	97800	able to make it work. Someone else's misfortune turned into your gain. Thank you, Fannie Mae.
97800	104160	No, seriously, they had a really kick-ass loan deal, got like a really low interest
104160	110440	rate, and normally, buyers like us, because we're not putting down a lot of money, you
110440	116280	would have to pay mortgage insurance, which that raises your monthly payments by a couple
116280	120320	hundred dollars, which would price it out of range. However, they gave us a special
120320	125640	deal where we didn't have to have mortgage insurance, so we didn't. So it ends up now
125640	132200	our house payments are really about $60 more than what our apartment was. We're like, okay.
132200	136680	That's great. Wow. We can do that. I'm a little jealous, but see, I'm not married. I don't
136680	140440	have someone to share that type of income with. People say you can get a roommate and
140440	143980	so on and so on to make it work, but I just don't. It would be tough. It would be tough,
143980	147960	because what happens if you can't find one? That's the situation I find myself in. Or
147960	152880	if they leave, it would just be difficult. Our old buddy, Bobby Black Wolf, who tapes
152880	156880	before us live on Sunday nights at All Games Radio, where we start at six o'clock Pacific
156880	161320	but he starts at five o'clock Pacific, is in our chat room at chat.orangelaunchradio.com.
161320	165260	How much did I plug in that one sentence? He says, hey, I'm buying my first house this
165260	168960	summer too. I just got pre-approved for a mortgage. Congratulations. It's a good time
168960	174240	to do it, because that government program where you get eight grand back in your taxes
174240	179480	next year, that's putting a new roof on our house. Nice. That'd be awesome. Quick, anyone
179480	186560	want to get married? Buy a house with me? No, I'm just kidding. Oh my gosh. It's definitely
186560	191240	a time to buy. Now, bringing it back to video games, since that's what our show is all about,
191240	196240	is now your house. Are you doing anything special with the tech? I don't know necessarily
196240	200280	the games, because I know the wife is not a fan of games not called Excite Truck or
200280	204200	Bejeweled, but I know you were talking about something tech that you're doing with the
204200	208720	babies that are coming soon. We may do, like, I was thinking it would be cool to do video
208720	214600	monitors, because usually how you do a baby monitor that's audio or something like that.
214600	220600	But they had a commercial that I saw on TV, or like Home Depot or something like that,
220600	225520	where some guy was doing a project where he had video monitoring for their babies. But
225520	230400	having two of those, and we can do picture in picture on TV while we're watching TV and
230400	234240	stuff, you can see the two babies there. I don't know. That would probably be really
234240	241760	expensive and a lot of work for something that's kind of neat. But we'll see. Mainly
241760	247160	network stuff I'm going to have to run a bunch of networking stuff through our attic, because
247160	254840	I can't stretch a 50-foot Cat 5 cable anymore. It's going to be interesting to see how your
254840	259400	stories change once those babies are born. I'm very curious to see what's going to change
259400	263720	in the house of Loki. We'll see. Alright, but congratulations on the house. That's something
263720	267400	else. Thank you. I helped him move into it Saturday, because that's what friends do.
267400	274520	And it's a nice house. It's very similar to the one I rent, but I only rent it. You know,
274520	278240	with the hardwood floors, and the one bathroom and three bedrooms, and the bedrooms are a
278240	286760	little small. I have to put in those floors. Yeah, they're laminate. It's a particle board.
286760	291640	It's kind of like this desk. More comments from chat.orangelaunchradio.com. If you're
291640	295600	listening to us on All Games Radio Live on this Sunday night, please join us. Say hello.
295600	300320	Deekman says, you stream it. Or too creepy. I think that's a little too creepy. That'd
300320	307800	be boring. Who would watch baby monitors on YouTube? Well, I guess you'd be surprised.
307800	314840	And Toshan says, Loki, my neighbor has a video baby monitor. I could get info. I'm sure it's
314840	319680	easy to do, because it's just, I think it's just video. You probably wouldn't do audio.
319680	324600	And so it'd basically just be running the video line through the ceiling to wherever
324600	329160	you're going to watch it, I guess. Or they may even have it, you know, Wi-Fi, which would
329160	333760	make things even easier. They wouldn't have to run anything. Deekman in chat says, Loki,
333760	338540	get the angel care baby monitors. It beeps if the baby doesn't move. So it's advice from
338540	343400	another parent, because I know Deekman. Is that like the, what was it, everything's okay
343400	351680	alarm? Beep. Beep's not moving. That's scary stuff, though. But wow. All right. SSJ100Matt
351680	355200	says, I can think of a few people here who would watch it. That's a little creepy. I'm
355200	361760	sorry. Why would you be watching that when you can play games? Like doing it for a minute
361760	367920	to go, aw, how cute. I'll just put pictures up. It's like watching the kitty, like tons
367920	372220	of people on Justin TV do this, have the kitties on Justin TV. Like you'll watch it for a minute
372220	376560	and go, aw, it's cute. But like if you're watching it for like hours at a time, like
376560	379880	seriously, you need to just adopt a cat. There's many cats out there that could use a good
379880	386720	home. Yeah. Our cat did not like moving. But that's pretty cool that you have like, you
386720	389320	know, that we've been doing this show long enough and we have such an awesome listener
389320	396000	base that essentially the listeners are offing to babysit your children via Ustream. Well,
396000	402800	I don't know, that's. I know, it's not, it's no substitute for the real thing. All right.
402800	406440	We're going to get into our gaming weeks and talk about how is your gaming week. And you
406440	409240	know, if there was something you played at E3 that we didn't get to last week, because
409240	412160	I know there's a couple games I want to talk about tonight, feel free to get into that
412160	417520	as well. How was your gaming week, Loki? Honestly, I don't remember anything I played at E3. Like
417520	424240	people ask me, so what'd you play? Like, uh, stuff? No, I remember playing one thing I
424240	431440	played at Sega, was it Sega Rally All Stars or I don't know. It's some sort of like Mario
431440	436840	Kart with Sega characters game. And it was like Mario Kart with Sega characters game.
436840	442600	You know what's weird though? Is they have like commentators, which is odd. I was not
442600	446480	imagining commentators in that kind of game. Is that the game that's supposed to have like
446480	450800	Greg Proops as a commentator? No, no, no. That's Mad World. That's awesome. Oh, that's
450800	457320	right. Okay. That would be, that's already out. Why did I think that was a racing game?
457320	462160	I don't know, but hey, they want to come back and do commentary in that game. You know,
462160	469160	not changing up any of the language whatsoever. I might actually make that game good. No,
470160	474600	so I played that. I think that was like kind of on Thursday when I was just like, eh, I
474600	477560	don't know what I want to do, so I'm going to start playing some random games. I watch
477560	483320	people play a lot of stuff, but I don't know. This week I actually played, you know, more
483320	493760	Grand Theft Auto 4, because we play that every day. I played some Prototype, which is fun.
493760	500760	It's really underwhelming as far as graphics go. I mean, it's very plain looking, but if
500760	503880	you think about the developer of the game, they actually were the ones that did like
503880	509880	the Hulk, the Ultimate Destruction stuff. It's very simple graphics, but it's the same
509880	515800	type of gameplay where you can throw things in the stuff and just go crazy. You can absorb
515800	520840	people and take their life to kind of boost your health and stuff like that. When you
520840	527560	do that, it's just brutal. You'll just step on their face or knee them in the groin and
527560	534360	they just absorb into your body. It's just weird, but it's absolutely bloody. Most games
534360	540800	are just kind of that brown color. This is all red. It's just red everywhere, just blood.
540800	543720	It's awesome, but I haven't really played too much of it.
543720	547680	Yeah, the actual blood isn't that cartoony red. Like when you get a paper cut, it looks
547680	549840	cartoony red, but real blood is like...
549840	554560	No, people explode. It's just stained all over the street. I mean, it's just crazy.
554560	559760	Unless it's over the top, which it sounds like it is. See, and we get into the topic
559760	564080	we got into a few weeks ago, talking about Saw and that whole thing, where I can't watch
564080	567920	the Saw movies because it's too real for me. But when the violence is over the top...
567920	568920	Yeah, this is over the top.
568920	571080	Okay, I think that stuff is funny.
571080	574520	Like snapping people in half and stuff like that. It's just ridiculous.
574520	576840	Mortal Kombat, over the top, always has been.
576840	581740	You can grab somebody and just run into the ground with them. There was one that they
581740	586520	had in a video where he grabs a soldier, slams down into a building, jumps up again, slams
586520	591240	down to another building, keeps going down until he flies off the skyscraper, and then
591240	596960	slams it into the ground. Plus, you can do sprinting. It'll automatically do the parkour
596960	602120	stuff. So you can jump off buildings, running upside of buildings. Just absolutely crazy
602120	602840	stuff.
602840	607520	But being spoiled with games like Crackdown and stuff, where it actually looks pretty
607520	615520	and does most of that stuff, really there's no excuse for that. But hey, who cares? It's
615520	619560	fun. It's worth playing.
619560	624240	The other game I tried to play this week, and really pissed me off because once I found
624240	630080	out about this game, I'm like, oh, I gotta get this. Angry Berry, which is an XNA game.
630080	638080	It's basically Obama the game, the fighting, it's like a Final Fight type game. It's absolutely
638080	644840	ridiculous. The problem is it's broken on Xbox community games right now. You can download
644840	650680	the game and it won't boot up at all, and you waste money, which sucks. But Angry Berry-
650680	652960	Wait, don't these things have to go through like a-
652960	657640	Yeah, they should, and it pissed me off because it was working, so apparently he updated something
657640	663640	and it broke it. So now I paid for this and I can't play it, and it's really making me
663640	664840	sad because-
664840	669160	I'm actually looking at some footage of this here in studio off of YouTube.
669160	673760	It's absolutely ridiculous. You can pick up- the first level, you're apparently fighting
673760	675760	like old ladies, and then-
675760	680800	Yeah, cat ladies in Central Park. On the start of his quest, Berry runs into a bunch of old
680800	684600	dotties- went off the screen, let me roll it back a little bit- a bunch of old dotties
684600	689680	who have a much different idea of who should rule the world. As he continues, Berry is
689680	694480	haunted by a ghost from his past who may end his quest before it starts. And-
694480	698280	So basically the game's kind of funny because he runs around and he can punch things and
698280	702280	stuff like that, and he can punch people in the face, but he can also pick up stuff, like
702280	704280	unrealistically, like, you know, the park bench.
704280	705280	It just picked up a bench.
705280	710280	Oh no, it gets better. It gets better. He can pick up people by their heads, and then
710280	715280	he can also pick up, like, buses and stuff. It's just absolutely ridiculous. See, there-
715280	718280	he picked up a jogger and he's like trying to smash people.
718280	723280	Okay, but the- the caliber quality of this game looks like somewhere between NES and
723280	724280	Super Nintendo.
724280	725780	It's awesome, the way you can-
725780	729280	Somebody's running by yelling, have my baby, Berry. That's, uh-
729280	734280	Wait, wait, wait. Keep going until you get to the bus because that's hilarious.
734280	738280	Let me fast forward a little ways here, if I can.
738280	742280	He picked up the jogger.
742280	746280	Part of me wonders if this is, like, really disrespectful. I don't know. There's the bus.
746280	749280	This is awesome right here.
749280	751280	Bunch of old ladies getting out of the bus.
751280	752280	Old ladies and stuff.
752280	755280	They just picked up the bus and started smashing old ladies.
755280	760280	That's awesome. Right there. That was instant purchase for me. I'm like, I must buy this game.
760280	762280	And I did, like, instantly.
762280	763280	Problem was-
763280	766280	But it doesn't work. Well then how come it works in this little demo I'm looking at on YouTube?
766280	769280	I don't know, but there's a lot of people who have played it too.
769280	772280	But for whatever reason it's broken now. I get a code 4 error.
772280	778280	So they have a thing, actually. You report it to Xbox.com slash abuse, and there's a link to-
778280	783280	Normally it's for offensive stuff, but there's also a thing for if it's broken.
783280	787280	And so hopefully they'll fix it. It says I purchased it, and then I'll get to play it.
787280	791280	Ssj100matt in our chatroom, chat.orangewordancemedia.com wants to clarify,
791280	794280	when the fixed version comes out, you can re-download it and it will be okay.
794280	796280	You don't need to buy it again.
796280	800280	And it's Angry Berry, like B-A-R-R-Y, like Barack.
800280	803280	Not Angry Berry as in, like, Raspberry or Dingleberry.
803280	805280	Yes. Angry Berry.
805280	808280	And it looks awesome.
808280	811280	Interesting. Alright, anything else for your gaming week?
811280	812280	No, that's it for right now.
812280	816280	Alright, I want to talk about a few games that I played at E3 that I never got around to last week.
816280	820280	And one of them is Blur, which is a pretty highly anticipated racing game, obviously,
820280	824280	because it's coming from Bizarre Creations, who used to do the Project Gotham Racing.
824280	829280	And, you know, as you know, they're doing their own series now. Blur has been announced what it is.
829280	835280	And it's really not like Project Gotham Racing at all, which I could never really get into Project Gotham Racing
835280	839280	because it was a little too much for me. Like, I can't control the car right.
839280	841280	I'm too used to arcade racing games.
841280	843280	Besides, I have Need for Speed Shift now, if you wanted that.
843280	850280	Well, and the good news is, or, you know, the Forza series is continuing with Adam and all that.
850280	852280	Anyhow...
852280	855280	Well, Project Gotham, I don't know if that's still...
855280	858280	I'm sorry. Yeah, Project Gotham, I don't know if that's continuing, but...
858280	859280	I think it is.
859280	868280	Yeah. Anyhow, Blur is now, like, a realistic racing game, but it mixes that with the types of stuff you'd see in Mario Kart,
868280	873280	which I thought was actually kind of cool. Like, you know, the graphics obviously had a very electric feel to it.
873280	877280	I'm not just talking about, that's why, because you see that in the trailer,
877280	882280	but this very kind of, like, neon metal sort of look to it, like the blues and pinks and yellow,
882280	886280	like, not, like, over the top, like, 80s, but kind of that metallic look to it.
886280	888280	It's a very kind of neat, stylish-looking game.
888280	894280	And as you race around the course, you can, you know, race over these power-ups, just like you do in Mario Kart,
894280	899280	and they'll give you things such as a missile-type thing where you launch a red sphere at other cars in front of you,
899280	906280	something called, like, Barrage, I think it was called, or something where it was, like, a purple thing that you'd shoot out on the sides, essentially,
906280	912280	so you could push your way past somebody, and then, like, a bolt that would just send a random lightning bolt down,
912280	914280	and, of course, a nitro that would speed you up.
914280	919280	All these different types of power-ups in a Burnout-style arcade racer,
919280	924280	not where, like, you know, pile-ups and crashing cars is encouraged like it is in Burnout,
924280	927280	but that sort of, like, look and speed and feel to the cars to it.
927280	932280	And the way they had it set up at E3 is that they had, like, 20 Xboxes all networked together,
932280	934280	and everybody was essentially playing the same thing.
934280	937280	And I had a lot of fun playing it. I think it'll be a fun game on Xbox Live.
937280	940280	It's like Mario Kart, but more real cars.
940280	944280	So, and from what I am understanding, they're actually licensing real cars for this game.
944280	945280	Yeah.
945280	948280	So it's, like, real cars that shoot lightning.
948280	952280	So it's a little strange, but it was actually a heck of a lot of fun to play.
952280	954280	I think I'm going to pick up the whole thing when it comes out.
954280	956280	I don't know what you're thinking, Loki.
956280	957280	I know you didn't play it, but...
957280	958280	Oh, no, you did play it a little bit, didn't you?
958280	959280	No.
959280	961280	Oh, and, sorry, the Xbox broke when you sat down on the floor, didn't it?
961280	963280	The server crashed when I tried to play it.
963280	964280	That's right.
964280	967280	I hope it looked fun.
967280	971280	Some other games I played at E3 that I wanted to point out.
971280	974280	White Knight Chronicles, I think we touched on a little bit last week.
974280	975280	Yeah.
975280	976280	I didn't play it, but I watched Loki play it.
976280	978280	It looks like a lot of fun.
978280	979280	That's a role-playing game.
979280	983280	It looks pretty intensive, and I definitely want to check that out.
983280	985280	That's a good exclusive for PlayStation 3.
985280	986280	It is.
986280	988280	Especially if you're, like, the role-playing fan type.
988280	993280	Because it looks like it has the huge landscapes, kind of like Oblivion does, but it's more
993280	995280	of a third-person-oriented game.
995280	997280	It reminds me a lot of Final Fantasy XI.
997280	999280	Like, the landscape's very similar to that.
999280	1000280	Really?
1000280	1001280	There's zones.
1001280	1002280	But not online.
1002280	1003280	This game was not online.
1003280	1004280	It's online, no.
1004280	1006280	You actually, well, you can play online.
1006280	1010280	You can play online with a party of a few people, and then you can do that.
1010280	1011280	Or it's AI.
1011280	1012280	And the AI actually is good.
1012280	1016280	They do what they're supposed to, and they're not doing retarded things.
1016280	1019280	So that's kind of cool.
1019280	1021280	But I think it is online, too.
1021280	1022280	So that might be fun.
1022280	1026280	I don't think I ever mentioned last week that I did try out Katamari Forever, which is the
1026280	1030280	new Katamari Damacy game on PlayStation 3 that takes some of the old levels and kind of repackages
1030280	1031280	them.
1031280	1033280	And there are some newer levels, too.
1033280	1037280	Like, for instance, I played a level where you were rolling around the Katamari, and
1037280	1039280	you would start in water.
1039280	1041280	And then as you rolled around, you lost water.
1041280	1043280	Kind of like, imagine your Katamari's a giant sponge.
1043280	1045280	And you're basically rolling it over dirt.
1045280	1047280	And as you roll over the dirt, flowers grow.
1047280	1052280	So the idea was you tried to paint so much of the ground with flowers and the time limit.
1052280	1055280	And then there's some secret, you know, the gal that was showing off the game was showing
1055280	1059280	me there's some secret areas where you can find more water so you don't have to run back
1059280	1061280	every time as you lose the water.
1061280	1064280	And that's kind of the strategy to get higher scores in that level.
1064280	1066280	So there are some new things in the game.
1066280	1069280	So Katamari Forever is not just a rehashing of the old stages.
1069280	1073280	The one thing that was cool about it is that they have different art styles.
1073280	1076280	There's very unique different art styles now that you can use.
1076280	1080280	Especially this whole, where it starts all in black and white.
1080280	1085280	And then as you roll over objects, those objects will be in color anywhere you see them.
1085280	1086280	Which I thought was kind of cool.
1086280	1091280	So some of these new art styles they're adding are making the game feel newer and certainly
1091280	1095280	it's not just like, oh, we're just going to repackage the same game on Playstation 3
1095280	1097280	and, you know, with widescreen and we're done.
1097280	1099280	You know, they definitely have gone back and done some tweaks.
1099280	1103280	At the end of the day, though, it is still a lot of the same levels, you know, and things.
1103280	1107280	So if you've owned every other Katamari game, well, heck, you're probably a big enough
1107280	1108280	fan of the franchise.
1108280	1109280	We're going to want to buy this anyway.
1109280	1115280	But I definitely had, in the few minutes that I was playing this, I already had more fun
1115280	1117280	playing it than I did beautiful Katamari on the 360.
1117280	1119280	Which I just never got into.
1119280	1120280	I don't know what it is.
1120280	1121280	I don't know what it was about that game.
1121280	1123280	Maybe it's just the controller of all things.
1123280	1126280	I just could not get into Katamari on the 360.
1126280	1127280	But the Playstation 3 one was fun.
1127280	1131280	They added a new game mechanic, too, where you can actually bounce, you actually basically
1131280	1133280	jump with the Katamari.
1133280	1138280	Which is a little unrealistic, but hey, I mean, rolling around, rolling up entire islands
1138280	1139280	in the earth is a little unrealistic, too.
1139280	1143280	You know, I don't like, the only thing I would change about Katamari is I don't like
1143280	1150280	the action that you have to do, the motion, to charge up your ball to do a little dash.
1150280	1154280	I think it should just be a button press, which would make things a lot easier, because
1154280	1158280	it's just a pain in the ass to kind of rock it back and forth to do that.
1158280	1162280	Yeah, you know, I didn't actually try doing that, the dash.
1162280	1165280	I was playing too much with the jump and the whole flipping.
1165280	1168280	I like to do the, you know, you click the buttons and it flips the ball around so you
1168280	1171280	don't have to spend the whole time doing a turn.
1171280	1178280	In the chat, Azure Edge is saying, in Japan, Katamari Forever is called Katamari Tribute.
1178280	1179280	Yeah, it's true.
1179280	1180280	It was a different name in Japan.
1180280	1184280	I believe it's already out over there.
1184280	1185280	It was fun.
1185280	1186280	I might pick it up.
1186280	1189280	I was under the impression, I don't know why, I thought this game was an arcade game
1189280	1192280	when I first saw it, like it was a Sony download game, but it's not.
1192280	1194280	They told me it is coming out on disc.
1194280	1197280	Yeah, that's what people thought, and it is coming out on disc.
1197280	1200280	So it is a full disc game, just in case you weren't aware.
1200280	1206280	One other game I think I wanted to mention, I'm looking at my notes.
1206280	1208280	Oh, Toy Story Midway Mania.
1208280	1212280	I never mentioned this game, which is, you know, Don't Write It Off is simply a child's
1212280	1213280	little shoot-em game.
1213280	1217280	This is one for Disney fans, which, you know, I know some of our listeners are.
1217280	1221280	It is just like the ride that they have at Disneyland and Walt Disney World.
1221280	1223280	They opened them both up this year.
1223280	1225280	It's pretty much the same ride where you sit in the cars and go around.
1225280	1227280	However, they have added new stages.
1227280	1230280	There's like a skee-ball type stage, and you know, some other little games.
1230280	1234280	And apparently it's the whole thing where as you play more and get more points,
1234280	1235280	you can unlock more mini-games.
1235280	1237280	But here's the funniest thing about it.
1237280	1240280	It is going to come with 3D glasses, and you can play the games in 3D,
1240280	1241280	just like you do on the ride.
1241280	1243280	So I think that's kind of funny.
1243280	1244280	Pretty cool.
1244280	1248280	Yeah, so I think this game is, you know, if you're a Disney fan,
1248280	1251280	for most people, especially you're really hardcore gamers,
1251280	1252280	you're going to look at this and go,
1252280	1256280	this is just another crappy Wii game with a bunch of, you know, little mini-games.
1256280	1259280	But I think especially like if you have kids, or you're just like a Disney fan,
1259280	1263280	and you have, like for me, it's the nostalgia of the ride
1263280	1265280	and being at Disneyland that really does it for me.
1265280	1266280	So it's cool.
1266280	1267280	It's a cool little mini-game collection.
1267280	1269280	The other one that I thought was kind of cool is a mini-game,
1269280	1273280	and it's kind of like Jenga, where you, like these little block structures
1273280	1276280	will appear, and like you load this cannon with a ball,
1276280	1278280	and then you kind of swing the Wiimote to throw the ball.
1278280	1281280	And then depending on like when and where you throw it,
1281280	1284280	you knock, you're trying to knock over as many blocks as possible.
1284280	1285280	Boom blocks, awesome.
1285280	1288280	Is it kind of like, yeah, it's kind of a rip off of that, I guess.
1288280	1289280	But I thought that was kind of fun.
1289280	1291280	So take it or leave it.
1291280	1292280	There you go.
1292280	1295280	All right, just so you know tonight on the show,
1295280	1297280	getting into some housekeeping a little bit,
1297280	1299280	we're going to try something new tonight with the show,
1299280	1301280	kind of just based on feedback and things we've been wanting to do for a while,
1301280	1303280	which is a little weird because Jamie's not here,
1303280	1305280	but she knows about it, and she'll get here probably halfway through the show
1305280	1306280	and be able to help out.
1306280	1309280	We're going to try something tonight, and it may or may not work.
1309280	1312280	First off, we're going to have the Skypline open all night long,
1312280	1314280	which I know we've done before to make success,
1314280	1318280	but one reason we think people don't usually call in
1318280	1320280	when we have the Skypline open all night long
1320280	1322280	is that we move too quick from story to story.
1322280	1328280	So since most of you guys that listen to the show already know the news
1328280	1330280	and kind of the main rundown of stuff that happened in the week,
1330280	1333280	I'm sure you read gaming blogs, you listen to other shows,
1333280	1336280	we want to expand a little more on having roundtable discussions
1336280	1338280	on a limited scope of stories.
1338280	1341280	Don't worry, we'll bring you the quick news too close to the end of the show,
1341280	1344280	but we're going to try focusing on in our Part A and Part B,
1344280	1347280	just like maybe six stories each segment,
1347280	1350280	that can kind of get a little more discussion.
1350280	1353280	So if you want to call in at any point during the show to add to the discussion,
1353280	1356280	you can always give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR,
1356280	1359280	or of course you can always send us emails and so forth.
1359280	1362280	Of course our chat room, chat.orangelandraday.com,
1362280	1363280	is always available there as well.
1363280	1366280	And then of course we're going to spend a little more time in studio
1366280	1367280	talking about these different topics.
1367280	1369280	So let us know your feedback.
1369280	1371280	Of course, as always, mailbag at orangelandraday.com,
1371280	1374280	or our Twitter, twitter.com slash o-l-r,
1374280	1378280	or the Facebook group, the OL Army,
1378280	1380280	which we haven't really done anything with for a while.
1380280	1381280	We need to.
1381280	1383280	And yeah, so we're just going to open it up.
1383280	1387280	Less stories, more time on each story is basically what it boils down to.
1387280	1390280	So let's see what happens.
1390280	1393280	So I'll start off tonight with a news story
1393280	1397280	that kind of confirms something we heard about a while ago.
1397280	1399280	There was a trademark about this a little while ago
1399280	1403280	that spurred this whole debate I think we've had once before on the show.
1403280	1405280	But it was confirmed.
1405280	1409280	Nintendo will be launching a help feature inside of their games.
1409280	1412280	This story comes from USA Today's Game Hunter blog.
1412280	1414280	Game Hunter's blog, sorry.
1414280	1417280	And it's talking about how Miyamoto has essentially confirmed
1417280	1420280	that on New Super Mario Brothers Wii,
1420280	1423280	you're going to be able to pause the game if you're on a difficult level,
1423280	1425280	and the game can take over to complete the level,
1425280	1429280	and then you hit a button whenever you want to resume playing.
1429280	1432280	And the thought behind it is that if you have a younger player
1432280	1434280	or you have somebody who is newer to video games,
1434280	1436280	they don't get so intimidated by it.
1436280	1441280	Which, if you remember right, was Nintendo's whole thing in the first place.
1441280	1444280	The whole reason why they introduced the Wii in the first place was that,
1444280	1446280	hey, everybody knows how to use a remote control.
1446280	1448280	People get intimidated by game controllers.
1448280	1451280	Let's take that intimidation factor out.
1451280	1454280	But now they're talking about, oh, now they're going to take,
1454280	1458280	essentially, the challenge out of the game for those that want it.
1458280	1462280	And of course, as you can imagine, this is hugely controversial.
1462280	1466280	Moving on with the story, Shigeru Miyamoto did say in the interview
1466280	1469280	that there's going to be this demo play,
1469280	1472280	is what they're calling it, the tentative name of this, the demo play.
1472280	1474280	Here's the quote from the article.
1474280	1476280	Quote, in New Super Mario Brothers Wii,
1476280	1479280	if a player is experiencing an area of difficulty,
1479280	1482280	this will allow them to clear troubled areas and take over when they're ready.
1482280	1486280	And yes, we're looking into this for future games, too.
1486280	1488280	So it's the easy button.
1488280	1490280	Like in the Staples commercials, you hit the button,
1490280	1492280	and easy, you get your way through it.
1492280	1494280	Good thing, bad thing, Loki.
1494280	1499280	As I mentioned earlier, I know it's wrong to say this,
1499280	1501280	but this is completely gay.
1501280	1503280	And the reason why...
1503280	1505280	It does make me want to sleep with games of the same gender.
1505280	1506280	Exactly.
1506280	1507280	It does.
1507280	1513280	No, it's okay to have... I guess it's alright if they want to put this option in
1513280	1516280	to other games, like Zelda or something like that.
1516280	1520280	That makes sense, because you're playing it demo-wise,
1520280	1522280	you can learn more of the story and stuff.
1522280	1524280	New Super Mario Brothers for the Wii,
1524280	1526280	I can't imagine that has a story at all.
1526280	1530280	So really, you're basically taking away the only element of the game,
1530280	1532280	which is playing it.
1532280	1535280	And so, I don't know.
1535280	1538280	I can't imagine these games being that difficult,
1538280	1542280	and the fact is that you can actually just autopilot the whole thing
1542280	1544280	seems kind of retarded to me.
1544280	1547280	And also, in the same way people are defending it and saying,
1547280	1551280	well, this will allow you to be able to make the games more hardcore,
1551280	1553280	more difficult for those that want it,
1553280	1556280	and those that can't handle it, well, they can push the easy button.
1556280	1560280	But at the same time, why can't they just balance it,
1560280	1562280	put the effort into balancing the game,
1562280	1565280	so that you have it for the easy players,
1565280	1567280	and for the more experienced players?
1567280	1569280	Oh, I know, like effort.
1569280	1572280	No, let's just autopilot the whole thing.
1572280	1573280	That's even better.
1573280	1574280	Okay, but what about the argument,
1574280	1576280	and this is the first thing I think of too,
1576280	1578280	and I see AlphaCananagram going to it in chat,
1578280	1579280	don't use it.
1579280	1581280	You don't like it, don't use it.
1581280	1584280	I don't care, it's just insulting that it's there in the first place.
1584280	1588280	I mean, because really, the message that comes across with that
1588280	1590280	is not that, oh, we're trying to help players.
1590280	1593280	Maybe like Devil May Cry or something like that,
1593280	1598280	or a game that's been notably insanely hard all the time.
1598280	1601280	Maybe something like an easy mode for that or something,
1601280	1604280	but not necessarily something that just plays the game for yourself.
1604280	1611280	I don't know, I think the better option should be something more approachable
1611280	1615280	as far as an easier gameplay option or something like that,
1615280	1617280	an easier difficulty so that those people...
1617280	1620280	you can take those portions of the game that are going to be frustrating out of it
1620280	1623280	or make them easier on this new difficulty.
1623280	1626280	I'm supposed to give you a slap on the wrist for calling it gay, by the way,
1626280	1627280	from the chatters.
1627280	1629280	Whatever, you know.
1629280	1632280	Obviously, he doesn't mean harm by that,
1632280	1633280	or I would, you know, I'm gay.
1633280	1636280	I'd kick his ass if I thought he actually meant malice by that,
1636280	1640280	but it is one of those things where I think the reason why you say that
1640280	1643280	and even why I allow you to say that
1643280	1649280	is because Nintendo does have that whole happy, sunshiny, rainbow, clouds.
1649280	1652280	If you think back to the old meaning of gay,
1652280	1653280	it does have that very...
1653280	1654280	You know what I mean?
1654280	1657280	It has that feel to it that Nintendo is all sugary sweet to it.
1657280	1660280	It's not even really entirely Nintendo's fault.
1660280	1662280	I put blame on society for this, too,
1662280	1666280	because nowadays it's not about, you know...
1666280	1669280	It's about everybody participating and everybody's a winner
1669280	1671280	because they've participated.
1671280	1673280	That's great, except you're not participating.
1673280	1676280	You're just pushing a button and the game's doing it all for yourself.
1676280	1678280	So now that you've seen the end of the game,
1678280	1680280	what's really going to entice you to go through it?
1680280	1682280	I mean, on your own.
1682280	1683280	It's not.
1683280	1686280	And it really just sends home the message that
1686280	1689280	Nintendo doesn't really give a crap about the core game.
1689280	1691280	I mean, they do in a certain sense,
1691280	1695280	but at the same time, really, their console is for the younger audience
1695280	1697280	and, well, we're making a few games for you as well.
1697280	1699280	Let me read some comments from chat.
1699280	1701280	And if you have a thought on this, too, give us a call.
1701280	1703280	1-877-GAME-OLR.
1703280	1705280	Is this making games too easy? What's going on?
1705280	1707280	Some other comments from chat here.
1707280	1708280	And this is one I agree with.
1708280	1709280	There's a gold anthro in chat that says,
1709280	1711280	you will have the temptation to use it.
1711280	1712280	That's the problem.
1712280	1715280	And for me, that might make me a little nervous, too.
1715280	1716280	But let's go to the phones.
1716280	1717280	We have a call.
1717280	1720280	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this?
1720280	1725280	Hello, you're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this?
1725280	1728280	And wouldn't you know, like, the first call we take,
1728280	1730280	it doesn't work.
1730280	1732280	Didn't use the easy button.
1732280	1733280	That's right.
1733280	1734280	Your call needs to be automated.
1734280	1736280	Can I please pause the show and hit the button?
1736280	1737280	No, all right.
1737280	1738280	Here's the thing.
1738280	1744280	I'm also surprised that this was not launched in the Zelda type of game.
1744280	1746280	And I kind of get it for that.
1746280	1749280	But I kind of agree with what GameGuru is saying in chat.
1749280	1750280	It's a Super Mario Brothers game.
1750280	1753280	If you can't play, you may as well give up gaming.
1753280	1754280	I don't know. Let's see.
1754280	1756280	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this?
1756280	1758280	Hi, this is Gold Anthro, actually.
1758280	1759280	Oh, Gold Anthro.
1759280	1760280	I just read one of your comments a minute ago.
1760280	1761280	What are your thoughts on this?
1761280	1764280	Is this making games too easy?
1764280	1765280	I think it is.
1765280	1767280	Because, you know, people say,
1767280	1769280	don't use it if you don't want to.
1769280	1772280	Like, if you don't want to use it, don't use it.
1772280	1775280	But there's that temptation.
1775280	1777280	Ah, sorry.
1777280	1782280	There's a temptation that people will use it because it is there.
1782280	1787280	I mean, if there's no reward for not using it, I'm sorry.
1787280	1789280	I got my family yelling at me.
1789280	1790280	You know what I mean.
1790280	1791280	There's going to be that temptation.
1791280	1792280	No, that's okay.
1792280	1795280	That's kind of where I feel, too, is that it gives that temptation.
1795280	1797280	But I'm trying to look at both sides of this.
1797280	1798280	I really am.
1798280	1802280	The Wii is that family-friendly, even your...
1802280	1804280	I'm going to let you go, Gold Anthro, but thanks for the feedback.
1804280	1811280	Wii's got that very family-friendly soccer mom,
1811280	1814280	let the seven-year-old play Image to Preserve.
1814280	1818280	You know, a feature like this kind of makes sense for a system like that.
1818280	1820280	I don't think it does.
1820280	1827280	The problem with Nintendo and a lot of the game publishers
1827280	1832280	and a lot of the companies out there that are producing consoles is this.
1832280	1836280	They're making the consoles and the games more approachable
1836280	1838280	to people that don't play games,
1838280	1841280	but people are still not biting on them,
1841280	1843280	and so they're like, why are they not?
1843280	1844280	Let me take another call.
1844280	1845280	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
1845280	1846280	Who's this?
1846280	1847280	Hi, it's Sterlok.
1847280	1848280	Hi, Sterlok.
1848280	1850280	What do you think about this whole Nintendo easy mode
1850280	1852280	or what they're calling it demo mode?
1852280	1854280	Is this a good idea, bad idea?
1854280	1857280	I think it's a great idea.
1857280	1863280	I'm blind, and this would be awesome for something like Zelda
1863280	1868280	because I just like to walk around and just dick around.
1868280	1877280	If I want to get further, it's really easy to just turn this thing on.
1877280	1878280	I think it's a great idea.
1878280	1881280	You're saying that you're blind
1881280	1885280	and that you have probably problems with certain other games.
1885280	1889280	Do you find Zelda to be too hard the way it is now?
1889280	1893280	You probably kind of learn to deal with that
1893280	1895280	as you're playing with the video games, right?
1895280	1899280	Yeah, since I'm totally blind, I just play with sound.
1899280	1902280	Are you the same one that sent us e-mails before
1902280	1904280	on some of these subjects about some of the music games?
1904280	1906280	Okay, yeah, I remember you.
1906280	1909280	I guess here's kind of my thought.
1909280	1912280	That's a very good thing I wouldn't have thought of before
1912280	1914280	is that maybe it makes some of these games more handicap accessible,
1914280	1917280	certainly, if there's something a little too difficult.
1917280	1922280	But you've kind of come all this time gaming with that.
1922280	1926280	So why now for this?
1926280	1930280	Well, the main thing for me is progressing in the game itself.
1930280	1933280	That's the big thing for me, why I think this is such a good idea.
1933280	1939280	If I want to get further in these games, other than just walking around
1939280	1941280	and just doing a bunch of nothing,
1941280	1945280	I would have to get someone else to basically do it for me.
1945280	1952280	Sturlock, have you had games, a lot of games, where you hit that brick wall?
1952280	1956280	Yeah, because I'm big into RPGs.
1956280	1961280	Basically, I'm sort of restricted to just walking around
1961280	1964280	and finding random battles, which I like.
1964280	1973280	But if I want to progress in the story, not a whole lot I can do about that.
1973280	1976280	Well, Sturlock, I really appreciate the insight
1976280	1979280	and giving us another angle we may not have thought of otherwise.
1979280	1981280	So thank you very much, Sturlock, and you have a good one.
1981280	1983280	You too.
1983280	1985280	Definitely something I wouldn't have thought of before.
1985280	1989280	What about folks who might have something where they can't?
1989280	1992280	But maybe this speaks to a greater thing about making games
1992280	1994280	more handicap accessible to begin with,
1994280	1997280	and maybe this just isn't the way to do it. I don't know.
1997280	1999280	Then if that's the case, then how noble of Nintendo.
1999280	2001280	However, I don't think that's why they're doing it.
2001280	2004280	I would agree.
2004280	2007280	It's a perk for folks, but it's not the reason.
2007280	2009280	It's okay. We've made the games easier.
2009280	2012280	We've made the system that's more approachable for gamers
2012280	2015280	or people who have never played a game in their life before.
2015280	2018280	But the problem is still there's people out there
2018280	2020280	that they have not been able to capture yet
2020280	2022280	that aren't interested in the games, and they're trying to figure out,
2022280	2023280	why is that?
2023280	2025280	Oh, it must be that they're still too hard.
2025280	2027280	They're still too difficult.
2027280	2031280	Let's put this feature in that allows the game to play itself
2031280	2033280	in case they get stuck.
2033280	2035280	That's great, but you know what?
2035280	2041280	Getting that feature out there to a consumer that's not playing games,
2041280	2043280	I'm pretty sure they're probably not up to date
2043280	2046280	on everything that's coming into a certain game.
2046280	2049280	They're probably not going to know about it anyways.
2049280	2052280	And it's really just a waste of time,
2052280	2054280	because I don't think it's really going to accomplish
2054280	2056280	what they're hoping that it will accomplish.
2056280	2057280	Let me read a few more things from chat,
2057280	2059280	and then we'll move on with some more stories tonight.
2059280	2061280	I wanted to read some of these comments.
2061280	2063280	Azure Edge in chat says,
2063280	2065280	I thought all of this was just when you pause,
2065280	2067280	a movie comes up showing you how to do it,
2067280	2069280	but when you resume the game, you start off where you were at.
2069280	2071280	And perhaps that was in the original trademark.
2071280	2073280	I would have no problems with that.
2073280	2074280	That's fine.
2074280	2076280	If they're giving you tips on how to play the game,
2076280	2078280	then yeah, that seems very fair,
2078280	2080280	because that way they're helping you along,
2080280	2082280	but you actually have to do it.
2082280	2083280	And I do encourage that.
2083280	2086280	Let me read that quote again from Miyamoto.
2086280	2087280	In New Super Mario Brothers Wii,
2087280	2089280	if a player is experiencing an area of difficulty,
2089280	2091280	this will allow them to clear troubled areas
2091280	2093280	and take over when they're ready.
2093280	2094280	So, very interesting.
2094280	2095280	So yeah, that does not sound...
2095280	2096280	Let's take one more call, because we've got another call.
2096280	2099280	Hi, you're on Ornson's Radio. Who's this?
2099280	2100280	This is Spazinator.
2100280	2103280	Hey Spazinator, quickly, is this a good idea or a bad idea,
2103280	2105280	the demo mode?
2105280	2108280	A bad idea.
2108280	2111280	For a couple reasons.
2111280	2118280	First, although Nintendo is not coming out and directly saying it,
2118280	2123280	they're kind of implying that gamers are stupid.
2123280	2130280	They have to handle gamers to get them to finish the game.
2130280	2133280	And you've got to remember,
2133280	2136280	at least back in the original NES game,
2136280	2143280	they were scared towards the kids.
2143280	2146280	They were playing really, really difficult games on there,
2146280	2149280	like Kid Icarus, for one.
2149280	2153280	Games like that were really difficult.
2153280	2159280	People loved those games, even though they were difficult.
2159280	2164280	And a lot of people take pride in the fact
2164280	2167280	that they played these really difficult games
2167280	2171280	and ended up beating them.
2171280	2175280	For me, I feel that if a game is too easy,
2175280	2178280	you tend to lose interest in it.
2178280	2180280	Thank you very much, Spazinator, for the input.
2180280	2181280	We're going to talk about this a little bit,
2181280	2183280	but I'm going to go ahead and let you go for now
2183280	2185280	when we move on to other topics.
2185280	2188280	Some of what Spazinator is saying,
2188280	2191280	he kind of compares to the older games,
2191280	2193280	and a lot of people are very fond of those games.
2193280	2195280	When I think about this easy mode,
2195280	2197280	yeah, it's making games more accessible
2197280	2199280	to 7-year-olds and 10-year-olds,
2199280	2200280	but then I think back,
2200280	2201280	okay, when I was 10 years old,
2201280	2202280	I was busting my way through Kid Icarus,
2202280	2204280	which was one of the hardest games ever.
2204280	2205280	But at the same time,
2205280	2207280	I don't think the classic Nintendo
2207280	2209280	has penetrated the marketplace
2209280	2210280	the same way the Wii has.
2210280	2213280	I mean, the Wii is just huge. Huge.
2213280	2217280	There's a lot of problems,
2217280	2220280	and it's a lot of just stuff that right now,
2220280	2221280	it's society.
2221280	2224280	Basically, the games out here now,
2224280	2225280	if you're going to put out a lot of games
2225280	2226280	that you're trying to make accessible
2226280	2227280	for a 7-year-old,
2227280	2230280	and they're really super-duper easy,
2230280	2233280	yeah, you may get them interested in playing games
2233280	2235280	and they may think that they're all awesome
2235280	2237280	because they're able to finish these games,
2237280	2238280	but at the same time,
2238280	2240280	is that really making the 7-year-old a better gamer?
2240280	2241280	I mean, later on down the line,
2241280	2243280	are they going to be any better?
2243280	2245280	I think if you have to play a harder game
2245280	2247280	and you actually stick with it,
2247280	2250280	which is something we should be teaching our kids anyways,
2250280	2251280	sticking with something instead of,
2251280	2253280	oh, I can't do it, I quit.
2253280	2257280	I mean, that's really, I think, more important than anything
2257280	2258280	because then that way,
2258280	2260280	they learn to play the harder game,
2260280	2263280	they feel the accomplishment of finishing said hard game,
2263280	2266280	and then that makes them a better gamer overall.
2266280	2267280	All right, one more chat comment,
2267280	2268280	then we'll move on to the next story.
2268280	2270280	Deep Man in chat says,
2270280	2272280	also, I would probably use it when playing Zelda.
2272280	2274280	I love the series and the plot of the games,
2274280	2276280	but it just can't seem to focus.
2276280	2278280	But if I can progress quickly
2278280	2280280	without breaking the flow of the story,
2280280	2281280	then please hook me up.
2281280	2284280	This could be an interesting perspective,
2284280	2286280	and this is, you know, again,
2286280	2290280	where I almost support this feature in games like Zelda.
2290280	2292280	I'm not sure how I feel about it in, like, a Mario game,
2292280	2294280	but an adventure game like Zelda,
2294280	2296280	jury's still out for me on this whole thing.
2296280	2297280	I can be swayed either way.
2297280	2298280	I need to see it in action.
2298280	2300280	But for the Zelda games, I kind of sympathize.
2300280	2303280	I am such a short attention span gamer sometimes
2303280	2306280	that sometimes I don't want the challenge.
2306280	2307280	I want that story.
2307280	2309280	I want to watch the whole thing unfold.
2309280	2311280	Do you know how many games sit on my shelf
2311280	2312280	that I haven't beat
2312280	2315280	because I quickly move from one game to the next?
2315280	2316280	Like, I don't know.
2316280	2318280	I wish there almost sometimes there was a way.
2318280	2320280	I could just go back and finish them all.
2320280	2321280	But I don't know.
2321280	2323280	And that's great, but I don't think New Super Mario Bros.
2323280	2324280	has a story.
2324280	2326280	I'm pretty sure it doesn't.
2326280	2327280	So there's really no point.
2327280	2329280	And on top of that,
2329280	2332280	stop trying to develop technology to demo actual games
2332280	2335280	and give us stupid demos, for God's sake.
2335280	2338280	Seriously, it'd be nice to have demos for, I don't know,
2338280	2341280	Virtual Console, WiiWare, actual games.
2341280	2343280	That might be nice so I can know
2343280	2345280	if something's a stinker or not before I buy it.
2345280	2346280	Oh, that's right.
2346280	2347280	You wouldn't want that
2347280	2349280	because then there goes all your sales
2349280	2351280	when people realize that these games suck.
2351280	2353280	But just one more thing I wanted to throw out there
2353280	2355280	is that, again, in the whole adventure games,
2355280	2357280	when I get stuck, I go to gamefacts.com.
2357280	2360280	How much different is this
2360280	2362280	than having to look up the FAQ to get...
2362280	2364280	Like, for instance, playing Final Fantasy IV,
2364280	2367280	the after years, which was a game I continued on with this week.
2367280	2369280	You know, I got into this...
2369280	2371280	I was going through this one cave, the Devil's Road,
2371280	2374280	which is like, you know, you go from warp point to warp point,
2374280	2377280	and then you get in this one room that's like a giant maze,
2377280	2380280	and I was just like, God, I don't want to do another maze.
2380280	2381280	I want to get to a save point.
2381280	2382280	I want to go eat a burger
2382280	2384280	because that's just where I was at that point.
2384280	2385280	So you know what?
2385280	2386280	I loaded up Final Fantasy Wikia,
2386280	2389280	and there was a whole little map on how to get through that room,
2389280	2391280	and I just did it, and I was like, yay.
2391280	2392280	Exactly. That's fine.
2392280	2395280	That's okay, but see, you're not relying on...
2395280	2397280	I mean, to get you through a certain point,
2397280	2399280	it's just helping you out.
2399280	2402280	It's not saying, okay, you know, you need to do this,
2402280	2404280	or, you know, here, let me do this for you.
2404280	2407280	It's just saying, you know, here's what you need to do.
2407280	2408280	Go do it.
2408280	2409280	All right.
2409280	2410280	And that's fine.
2410280	2412280	That's just like saying, you know, hey, Rob,
2412280	2413280	I'm stuck in the Zelda game.
2413280	2415280	You've gotten past this point.
2415280	2416280	What am I supposed to do?
2416280	2419280	It's just like that, and there's no harm in that
2419280	2421280	because you're still having to do it.
2421280	2422280	It's just giving you a tip.
2422280	2423280	How often did you...
2423280	2425280	I know like many years ago, like in high school and stuff,
2425280	2426280	how often did you do that?
2426280	2427280	Like, your friend would be playing the game.
2427280	2428280	I can't get past this part.
2428280	2429280	Give me the controller.
2429280	2430280	Okay, there you go.
2430280	2431280	Exactly.
2431280	2433280	Why isn't Nintendo just bringing back the Nintendo tip line?
2433280	2435280	I mean, they can make more money that way.
2435280	2436280	Get some game counselors on staff.
2436280	2437280	There you go.
2437280	2438280	All right, let's move on with some more news.
2438280	2439280	All right.
2439280	2443280	Well, some other interesting stuff,
2443280	2446280	more in the music gaming platforms,
2446280	2450280	but we've got Neversoft talking about possibilities
2450280	2454280	of adding the DJ Hero turntable support
2454280	2456280	for future Guitar Hero games.
2456280	2458280	Now, that makes kind of sense if you think about it
2458280	2462280	because Guitar Hero 5, really, they're pushing that,
2462280	2464280	hey, you can play in any band setup whatsoever,
2464280	2469280	if it be four drummers, three guitars a singer, whatever.
2469280	2475280	So maybe later on, they can add DJ support as well.
2475280	2477280	They said they would have liked to have worked it into
2477280	2478280	Guitar Hero 5.
2478280	2481280	Unfortunately, Guitar Hero 5 ships in a few months,
2481280	2486280	and it's a few months before the DJ Hero thing comes out,
2486280	2489280	so maybe later on, they'll add it in there.
2489280	2491280	But it says it sounds like a great idea.
2491280	2495280	I don't think it's a great idea.
2495280	2498280	I mean, I don't think they're going to do it,
2498280	2500280	but it sounds like a cool idea.
2500280	2502280	I think, if anything, if they're going to have that type of stuff,
2502280	2506280	it's just going to be maybe tracks that you can download on DJ Hero,
2506280	2509280	but I'll have the guitar and DJ element in there.
2509280	2512280	And if you have an opinion on this or any other story we're going through tonight,
2512280	2515280	1-877-GAME-OLR is the number to call,
2515280	2517280	or our chat room is chat.orangelaungeready.com.
2517280	2520280	But this makes me think about, I was playing rock band this weekend.
2520280	2523280	You were over, we were checking out rock band,
2523280	2527280	and I don't have room for a turntable on top of all the other crap
2527280	2531280	that rock band, rock band, Guitar Hero, whatever,
2531280	2532280	same thing these days, right?
2532280	2535280	Well, not really, but same peripherals these days, right?
2535280	2539280	I don't have room for a turntable and somebody else to see the TV
2539280	2541280	on top of all that other stuff.
2541280	2543280	I mean, that is almost, in a way, like too much stuff.
2543280	2546280	I think it's one of those things, it's a nice idea in theory,
2546280	2549280	and it enhances the value of these peripherals
2549280	2551280	that we're dropping so much money on,
2551280	2554280	but then I also think, how many songs really are going to make use out of this?
2554280	2559280	How many turntable, rock hybrid songs can you think of?
2559280	2562280	Besides, like, Walk This Way by Aerosmith and Run DMC?
2562280	2566280	Well, there's a lot of, like, the Linkin Park stuff and stuff like that,
2566280	2567280	maybe Korn or something.
2567280	2568280	Okay, good point.
2568280	2573280	But, yeah, it's a minority of the songs that are out there,
2573280	2575280	and really, it's something I think that they would just support it
2575280	2578280	with more tracks that are available through DJ Hero.
2578280	2582280	And because DJ Hero is really about mixing music together,
2582280	2587280	this would be more of kind of like adding a little triangle
2587280	2590280	or something like that to Guitar Hero.
2590280	2594280	It just, it wouldn't really be a big focus instrument for it
2594280	2596280	unless they really went and did something.
2596280	2598280	At that point, why would you bother doing that?
2598280	2602280	Because you can't, I don't know, it'd be a lot of support for a game
2602280	2606280	that they could just add more support to the existing DJ games
2606280	2608280	to just get people to buy that instead,
2608280	2611280	and there's no real point to have to support it anyways.
2611280	2614280	You know, I still say you're going to be so limited with this, though.
2614280	2618280	Okay, on my rock band, I have rock band two, rock band one,
2618280	2621280	and I've got to have at least 40 to 50 download songs.
2621280	2623280	I mean, I have a lot of download songs.
2623280	2626280	I've given that company a lot of money, but they've earned it.
2626280	2628280	A lot of fun nights there with rock band.
2628280	2632280	Sometimes, when I have friends come over to play the game,
2632280	2635280	they get up ready to sing, they scroll through the list
2635280	2637280	and scroll and scroll and scroll and go,
2637280	2639280	I can't really sing any of these songs.
2639280	2643280	And I don't know how you guys do it when you play rock band,
2643280	2646280	but I know that we let the singer always pick the song
2646280	2648280	because they've probably got the hardest role.
2648280	2652280	You know, guitar is pretty much the same, and drums are pretty much the same,
2652280	2654280	and I assume turntable would be pretty much the same
2654280	2657280	no matter what song you're choosing, but it's always up to the vocalist.
2657280	2660280	And again, how much variety are you going to get
2660280	2664280	if there's only like ten songs that are going to support the turntable and all this?
2664280	2667280	It seems like, while it's a nice enhancement,
2667280	2670280	it seems like effort that could be better spent somewhere else.
2670280	2673280	And the only thing I could see, here would be a good idea.
2673280	2676280	You would take a game, I don't think Guitar Hero is the right game for it,
2676280	2679280	I think Band Hero would be the right game for it,
2679280	2682280	because Band Hero is going to be more pop music,
2682280	2684280	that has a lot more turntable stuff in it.
2684280	2686280	Wait, there's actually a separate game called Band Hero?
2686280	2689280	Yes there is, it's basically like Lego Rock Band,
2689280	2691280	because Lego Rock Band is going to be more pop music.
2691280	2694280	They had a demo, or they had a trailer for it at E3.
2694280	2697280	I know, I remember seeing that trailer, I thought that...
2697280	2698280	No, that's...
2698280	2700280	Okay, call me stupid, laugh at me, I don't care,
2700280	2703280	but I thought that was kind of like Guitar Hero 5's name.
2703280	2704280	I thought it was the same thing.
2704280	2705280	Nope.
2705280	2706280	I thought they were just finally admitting,
2706280	2708280	oh hey, Guitar Hero is not really a guitar game anymore,
2708280	2709280	so they're calling it Band Hero.
2709280	2711280	I thought it was Guitar Hero 5 Band Hero.
2711280	2718280	Band Hero now is basically the pop, easy, family-friendly game or whatever,
2718280	2720280	and they're going to have bundles and fun stuff for that.
2720280	2722280	But I think that would be more appropriate for Band Hero,
2722280	2727280	because then you could say have a download thing that adds DJ support in,
2727280	2733280	if you have DJ Hero, or hey, if you want to be interesting with it, I guess,
2733280	2736280	and since they don't really sell the instruments by themselves at the turntables,
2736280	2739280	maybe if you have a DJ Hero save file or something like that,
2739280	2742280	it detects it and it will allow you to play those games.
2742280	2748280	Or maybe if you have, say, songs available,
2748280	2751280	like download content or something that's Guitar Hero and DJs,
2751280	2753280	that you can play it in Band Hero.
2753280	2754280	Let me go to the phones.
2754280	2756280	We have a call here on our Skype line.
2756280	2757280	Hey, you're on Orange Lawn's radio.
2757280	2758280	Who's this?
2758280	2759280	Hey, it's Dan Shadow.
2759280	2760280	Hey, Dan Shadow.
2760280	2763280	What do you think of this whole thing, the turntables in Guitar Hero
2763280	2766280	and Band Hero and all this?
2766280	2770280	That wasn't really what I called it, but I just wanted to try it out.
2770280	2774280	Isn't it the new Guitar Hero game, or was it Rock Band, Beatles,
2774280	2778280	that lets you play multiple instruments in replacement of other instruments?
2778280	2780280	That's like Guitar Hero 5.
2780280	2785280	Yeah, because you were just mentioning the lead singer always rolls through
2785280	2789280	whatever song they want and then, you know, it's like they play guitar
2789280	2792280	and then no one wants to sing.
2792280	2795280	I just think it's a good thing.
2795280	2798280	The call is cutting in a little in and out.
2798280	2801280	I think we have a bad connection, but I kind of get the point there
2801280	2806280	that Guitar Hero 5 is kind of letting us do this more enhanced band thing
2806280	2808280	where if nobody wants to sing, then great.
2808280	2810280	We'll have two people play guitar.
2810280	2812280	Of course, that's more peripherals.
2812280	2814280	Hey, at this point you probably have enough.
2814280	2816280	Yeah, tons of people own them at this point.
2816280	2818280	You probably have enough, and hell, friends bring them over.
2818280	2820280	I guess that's probably not going to be the problem.
2820280	2824280	I can't see four drummers, but, you know, sure, why not?
2824280	2827280	Yeah, I just wanted to chime in and say that's the biggest problem I have
2827280	2830280	when I play Rock Band is that everyone wants to play one song.
2830280	2832280	The singer doesn't want to play this song or whatever.
2832280	2835280	Well, that's what I wanted to chime in on.
2835280	2837280	Go ahead and keep on with your DJ conversation.
2837280	2840280	No, hey, no worries, and don't worry.
2840280	2842280	We are experimenting with a new format tonight,
2842280	2844280	so if you want to call in while we were talking about stories,
2844280	2848280	it's perfectly okay if folks kind of want to go back a few steps within the story.
2848280	2850280	As long as somebody doesn't call in to say,
2850280	2853280	hey, I want to talk about Doom while we're talking about Guitar Hero,
2853280	2855280	we will have a space at the end of the show for folks
2855280	2857280	that want to call in on any topic in the open bar.
2857280	2860280	Thank you very much, Dan. Have a good night, okay?
2860280	2861280	Have a good one, guys.
2861280	2863280	The other thing I think they should do also,
2863280	2866280	but I know they're not going to because they're going to exclude people that way,
2866280	2868280	is they should have songs that require, okay,
2868280	2871280	this song has two drummers and a DJ in it or something like that.
2871280	2874280	Unique things. You can have the songs.
2874280	2878280	Just like DJ Hero is doing, they're going to have ten songs
2878280	2880280	that you can play guitar and DJ together.
2880280	2883280	Well, let's have some songs that you can do,
2883280	2888280	like say a DJ and then maybe two drummers and a singer or something.
2888280	2890280	Something really ridiculous.
2890280	2893280	It seems a bit much, but I think you're going to see some of these challenge things
2893280	2895280	in Guitar Hero online.
2895280	2899280	Here's a challenge. Do this challenge with four guitar players or something like that.
2899280	2901280	I think that's where you're going to see something like that,
2901280	2903280	but hold songs just for that.
2903280	2905280	But all it really is is people playing together.
2905280	2908280	It's the same thing. It's not like they're actually playing different parts.
2908280	2911280	If you do four guitarists, unless someone picks bass,
2911280	2913280	it's just going to be the same notes coming down.
2913280	2915280	All right, TigerClaw in our chat.
2915280	2918280	chat.orangelaunchradio.com is saying quite a bit about this.
2918280	2922280	Very curious about what the Armin van Buuren DJ game is going to be like,
2922280	2925280	which was oddly silent at E3, as was Scratch,
2925280	2928280	although now we're starting to see videos of Scratch be released this week and more.
2928280	2930280	I've already seen them.
2930280	2931280	Very interesting.
2931280	2934280	I want to read this comment from TigerClaw at chat.orangelaunchradio.com.
2934280	2937280	Adding guitars to a live DJ set or any other instruments
2937280	2939280	would make the mixes sound more lively.
2939280	2942280	I've heard a couple of live DJ sets that have live violins,
2942280	2945280	guitars, and all sorts of other instruments in the background,
2945280	2948280	usually when you hear a big trance tune accompanied by a guitar
2948280	2950280	during a breakdown or a buildup.
2950280	2952280	I think a violin in a music game would be awesome.
2952280	2957280	But when I read that, isn't that more going the other way,
2957280	2960280	putting guitars in DJ Hero, which they're already talking about doing?
2960280	2962280	Yes, and they are.
2962280	2966280	I think that's a cool idea as well, but it's kind of the other way.
2966280	2970280	It's putting guitars in DJ Hero because you're saying you're adding guitars.
2970280	2974280	But, to be fair, a very interesting line that's being blurred.
2974280	2978280	Would it be interesting if some of these songs were in both?
2978280	2980280	That would be cool, and another cool thing would be
2980280	2984280	you could have an option that there's ten songs in Guitar Hero 5
2984280	2987280	that have DJ support on, so you all play as a band,
2987280	2990280	but at the same time, the DJ is remixing the song,
2990280	2993280	just adding beats and stuff to it.
2993280	2996280	That would be kind of cool.
2996280	2999280	Not something I think that they're going to do this time around,
2999280	3001280	but it will be cool in the future.
3001280	3004280	Sure, we're spending $120 on this game and a controller,
3004280	3007280	so I'd hope I'd be able to use it in as many things as possible.
3007280	3010280	We have the time dilation dude in chat says,
3010280	3012280	again, we need more cowbell.
3012280	3014280	That's true, when are we just going to get cowbell in these games?
3014280	3016280	That's what we're waiting for.
3016280	3018280	WeMusic has cowbell.
3018280	3021280	Well, cowbell and that, but like in Rock Band and stuff like that
3021280	3022280	where you can play the cymbals.
3022280	3025280	Tambourine, sometimes it's a cowbell noise.
3025280	3029280	Yeah, they should actually have cowbell.
3029280	3032280	Kay Levster in our chat asks, is DJ Hero really going to work?
3032280	3034280	I think it's going to be fun.
3034280	3037280	I think it's going to be a fun game too, and it looks a lot of fun from the previews.
3037280	3038280	I already got my order in.
3038280	3042280	I mean, good thing, because I'm all about Rock Band.
3042280	3044280	When it comes down to Rock Band vs Guitar Hero,
3044280	3046280	right now I am totally in the Rock Band camp.
3046280	3048280	I think it's the superior game.
3048280	3052280	But, good thing for Activision, I'm highly interested by DJ Hero.
3052280	3053280	I think it could be a good thing.
3053280	3057280	And that has nothing to do with my prior obsession about BeatMania 2DX.
3057280	3060280	If you're still saying, wait for the reviews, wait for the reviews.
3060280	3062280	When the reviews come in on this game,
3062280	3066280	if you see reviewers comparing DJ Hero to BeatMania 2DX,
3066280	3068280	they are morons.
3068280	3070280	The games look completely different,
3070280	3074280	unless, granted, they quantify it with what makes them very different,
3074280	3076280	because the games are very different.
3076280	3079280	If you want a game that's like BeatMania 2DX, you're going to play Scratch.
3079280	3083280	I mean, because that game is 2DX with better scratching.
3083280	3084280	That's all it really is.
3084280	3086280	And that's the kind of thing.
3086280	3090280	I want to play both, because DJ Hero is more about mixing music together,
3090280	3095280	which I like doing, and Scratch is more about scratching.
3095280	3100280	It's really got the ability to do different techniques and stuff in there,
3100280	3102280	and really kind of make the songs your own,
3102280	3105280	instead of just kind of following note charts and stuff like that.
3105280	3111280	But, yeah, in the end, Scratch is basically 2DX with better scratching.
3111280	3114280	And DJ Dark Knight in chat says, G4 will, just you watch.
3114280	3115280	Oh, I have no doubt.
3115280	3117280	That's especially who I'm targeting that statement as.
3117280	3122280	So if you're the person that writes the reviews that Morgan and Adam,
3122280	3124280	or whatever their names are, read on X-Play,
3124280	3125280	do not make that mistake.
3125280	3129280	Like they did when they reviewed BeatMania on the PlayStation 2
3129280	3133280	a couple years ago, saying it ripped off Guitar Hero.
3133280	3138280	BeatMania's been around since 1997?
3138280	3142280	Guitar Hero's been around since 2005?
3142280	3146280	Well, if you need any evidence that it's really image first,
3146280	3149280	and then knowledge second on G4.
3149280	3152280	One of the hosts, I don't even know of what show,
3152280	3155280	because I don't watch G4, but she's a Perian playboy,
3155280	3159280	and she's promoting it on G4, so they get the cross-promotion there.
3159280	3163280	But just because she's a pretty face to look at, that's about it.
3163280	3166280	Well, remember, G4 is not a gaming network.
3166280	3167280	Not anymore?
3167280	3169280	Well, they haven't been for quite some time.
3169280	3172280	We just need to remember, they are a network that caters to boys
3172280	3175280	that have some gaming-related shows.
3175280	3177280	They make a big presence at E3.
3177280	3180280	I mean, they have their booth, and they run around and act goofy.
3180280	3182280	But you know what?
3182280	3187280	Sadly enough, I think Spike covers games better than G4.
3187280	3190280	Well, because Spike is for big boys, and G4 is for little boys.
3190280	3192280	Isn't that the way it's supposed to break down?
3192280	3195280	And boys who like reality TV, like cops and cheaters.
3195280	3197280	Not little boys, but you know what I mean?
3197280	3201280	It's more for the teen and 21-ish audience, you know what I mean?
3201280	3204280	It's G4's for frat dudes.
3204280	3205280	That's what G4 is for.
3205280	3207280	G4 doesn't really know what kind of a network it is.
3207280	3211280	It's just experimenting to see what sticks is really what it is.
3211280	3213280	Now, Deep Man says the E3 coverage is pretty good.
3213280	3216280	And I do know people that will watch G4's E3 coverage.
3216280	3219280	You know, and to be fair, they are like the only network
3219280	3222280	that's making a 24-7 practically presence at E3.
3222280	3226280	So I would actually almost agree, they probably do cover E3 better than anyone,
3226280	3229280	because they devote so much time to it, you know?
3229280	3230280	Yeah.
3230280	3232280	So, all right.
3232280	3235280	Xenocore in chat wants to clarify something, by the way.
3235280	3237280	It's Olivia Munn. I don't know how we got on the G4 tangent,
3237280	3238280	but it needs to stop.
3238280	3239280	Yeah.
3239280	3240280	No, that's all right.
3240280	3241280	Just one last comment.
3241280	3244280	Xenocore in chat says it's Olivia Munn, and she's not posing nude.
3244280	3248280	Half the otaku geeks in the world are going to experience nerd rage.
3248280	3250280	So, we'll see.
3250280	3252280	Well, here's, look, we were talking about, you know,
3252280	3255280	things we're really not interested in anymore.
3255280	3259280	This just makes me think Guitar Hero, think even less of Guitar Hero,
3259280	3261280	is Guitar Hero Van Halen.
3261280	3265280	Look, I mean no disrespect to Van Halen, who obviously is one of the great,
3265280	3268280	you know, a great, great band, even though they go through singers
3268280	3270280	like Toilet Paper.
3270280	3274280	The thing about Guitar Hero Van Halen is just that when I watch it,
3274280	3277280	and you could watch it at E3 if you knew where to look at Sony's booth,
3277280	3279280	as opposed to Activision's.
3279280	3283280	When you watch it, you just can hear the cash cow mooing
3283280	3284280	when you're watching the game.
3284280	3287280	It's re-skinned Guitar Hero Metallica. It's all it is.
3287280	3290280	And some more stories about this game that are coming out this week,
3290280	3292280	just don't even make me feel that much better about it.
3292280	3295280	Rolling Stone made a report earlier this week saying that
3295280	3299280	apparently the game is exclusive to David Lee Roth as the lead singer.
3299280	3302280	So, if you're expecting to hear like Right Now or something else
3302280	3304280	out of the Sammy Hagar era, too bad.
3304280	3307280	It's exclusive to the David Lee Roth era, which, you know,
3307280	3312280	I'm sure many music fans would care to argue that Van Halen really was
3312280	3315280	David Lee Roth and everything after that was just, you know,
3315280	3316280	them trying to hold on.
3316280	3321280	But, I don't know. They had some decent songs with the other lead singers.
3321280	3323280	It kind of also makes you go,
3323280	3327280	okay, well, how long was David Lee Roth really with them?
3327280	3330280	So, where are they going to get all their songs from?
3330280	3333280	And sure enough, if you start to kind of look at the song list,
3333280	3338280	you know, while if you were a fan of Van Halen back in the 80s
3338280	3341280	and David Lee Roth was around, you're going to be happy.
3341280	3347280	There's, you know, a lot of room for those that have been following
3347280	3350280	Van Halen later on, think the game could improve.
3350280	3352280	So, and yes, as Marissa in chat says,
3352280	3354280	it's Van Halen, not Van Hagar.
3354280	3360280	And that, by the way, is exactly what Activision was quoted saying at one point.
3360280	3362280	It's definitely Van Halen and not Van Hagar.
3362280	3365280	Interesting.
3365280	3367280	But I got to be honest.
3367280	3371280	Again, I'm just, I'm not really an interesting guitar hero of Van Halen.
3371280	3375280	If I was a hardcore Van Halen fan, I'd be all over this game.
3375280	3379280	You know, just like, I don't expect probably any of our listeners bought Sing Star Abba,
3379280	3384280	but I did, because I like Abba, and I'm not ashamed to admit it.
3384280	3388280	But I'm probably, you know, again, Sing Star Abba probably, what was it?
3388280	3391280	It was just really a 25-song expansion pack for Sing Star.
3391280	3393280	There's not a damn thing new or special about it.
3393280	3394280	You know what I want?
3394280	3396280	They don't even pretend.
3396280	3402280	I want Guitar Hero Huey Lewis and the News.
3402280	3404280	That's some good music there.
3404280	3406280	How about Guitar Hero Rick Roll Edition?
3406280	3408280	There's really only one song to play in it.
3408280	3410280	That's what we're moments away from becoming.
3410280	3414280	Or Guitar Hero Kenny Loggins would be pretty cool, too.
3414280	3415280	I don't know.
3415280	3416280	All right.
3416280	3417280	Well, there you go.
3417280	3421280	Van Halen is, Guitar Hero Van Halen, not a game I'm very interested in in the future.
3421280	3424280	Or hell, I'd just settle for some download content with those artists.
3424280	3426280	I mean, that would be fine.
3426280	3428280	And that's another thing, too, with Guitar Hero.
3428280	3435280	I mean, I'm glad that they put out, you know, download content I think about every week.
3435280	3436280	I'm not really sure.
3436280	3443280	But a lot of these things could easily just be, I don't know, available for download.
3443280	3448280	It's just like Rock Band, where they do the full album downloads and stuff like that.
3448280	3451280	I mean, they could easily turn one of those into another game.
3451280	3458280	Hey, let's take a full album, or a couple full albums of somebody, and let's add some other artists that they may have played with.
3458280	3460280	And done. Game.
3460280	3465280	And that's how they basically get the Guitar Hero artist games.
3465280	3467280	But really, yeah.
3467280	3471280	Granted, there's the Beatles Rock Band, but that's completely different.
3471280	3478280	I mean, they changed up the whole style of it, and it's a different kind of type of gameplay.
3478280	3483280	And then there's also Lego Rock Band, which is a little bit kind of a whoring of the franchise.
3483280	3487280	But I mean, it is more family-friendly, and it does look completely different.
3487280	3490280	And they're going to have a different type of music in there.
3490280	3491280	But yeah, you know.
3491280	3495280	Have they said, and I, you know, this is probably even something we've covered on the show, but I'm just so out of it.
3495280	3499280	Lego Rock Band is independent of the, oh no, I remember this guy brought up.
3499280	3501280	Lego Rock Band's list, you can't import it into the other games, can you?
3501280	3502280	Nope, different publisher.
3502280	3504280	That's right, because all the, yeah, I remember this.
3504280	3506280	This came up last week.
3506280	3508280	But I don't know if I'm really interested in Lego Rock Band.
3508280	3509280	I don't think I am.
3509280	3511280	Beatles Rock Band, I'm all over that shit.
3511280	3513280	That game looked amazing.
3513280	3515280	And I'm not even a hardcore Beatles fan.
3515280	3517280	I don't even think I've ever owned a Beatles album.
3517280	3522280	I like to, you know, obviously I think John Lennon was a great man, as were, you know, all the Beatles.
3522280	3524280	And you know, especially they do a lot of great humanitarian work now.
3524280	3529280	They have timeless classics, and you know, you hear the songs, they're just so embedded in our culture.
3529280	3535280	You can't help but not, but the game just looked like, wow, this is not just a cheap re-skinning.
3535280	3541280	Somebody really sat down at a table and thought, okay, how do we make, like not just how do we slap the Beatles in this game,
3541280	3545280	but how do we make a game about the Beatles in this franchise?
3545280	3547280	That's what really kind of made that game special.
3547280	3548280	It's effort, it's level of effort.
3548280	3552280	It's not just, okay, we took out Metallica, put in Van Halen, done.
3552280	3556280	Whereas I think Lego Rock Band was, okay, let's just slap Legos in Rock Band.
3556280	3557280	Yes.
3557280	3558280	Make it a family friendly franchise.
3558280	3561280	That is about as much effort as, you know, the Guitar Hero Van Halen.
3561280	3567280	But you all give it to them because that's one game, that's not like Guitar Hero Metallica, Guitar Hero Smash Hits,
3567280	3572280	Guitar Hero Van Halen, Guitar Hero 5, Guitar Hero Band Hero.
3572280	3573280	Guitar Hero Aerosmith.
3573280	3576280	Guitar Hero Aerosmith, well that's, I'm talking about this year basically.
3576280	3577280	Oh, okay, sorry.
3577280	3582280	I mean, you know, Guitar Hero for the DS, which just came out, On Tour 3.
3582280	3587280	Guitar Hero, which you'll probably have an On Tour 4 by the time we get to November.
3587280	3591280	It's just, it's too much.
3591280	3592280	Too much in one year.
3592280	3594280	I mean, God, space this stuff out.
3594280	3595280	Add it as download content.
3595280	3601280	Thank you for, you know, allowing the World Tour downloads to be available in Guitar Hero 5.
3601280	3610280	Unfortunately, you can't import the whole Guitar Hero World Tour, you know, song list into Guitar Hero 5 like you can with Rock Band 1 and Rock Band 2.
3610280	3619280	And assuming that it all stays the same, Rock Band 3, which you just build one continuous big song list, which I think is a great idea.
3619280	3621280	Do you think we'll get Rock Band 3 next year?
3621280	3622280	Maybe.
3622280	3630280	I think we will get Rock Band 3 because they're going to do three-bar harmonies in Rock Band and they may add some different stuff into it.
3630280	3631280	Who knows?
3631280	3632280	But I think there will be a new one next year.
3632280	3635280	I'm still hoping for a keyboard someday, but I know, fat chance.
3635280	3636280	Fat chance.
3636280	3639280	Alright, we're about an hour into tonight's show, so let's move on.
3639280	3642280	We've still got a couple more stories to go over.
3642280	3649280	We have no idea how long tonight's show is going to take, by the way, with this whole new format, but we're right on about the same usual time right now.
3649280	3652280	We've got a few more stories we want to go over with you guys, though.
3652280	3656280	And remember, you can call in at any time 1-877-GAME-OLR.
3656280	3660280	We are going to get past Guitar Hero and Loki's going to take us in a different direction.
3660280	3661280	Yes.
3661280	3663280	Now we're going to talk about hardware.
3663280	3671280	You've probably heard a lot of game companies touting that their game has maxed out the hardware of the PS3 or the Xbox 360.
3671280	3681280	Well, according to Richard Parr, who works at Criterion, he's basically said the proof is that you're not the best.
3681280	3684280	Basically, it means that you're out of ideas.
3684280	3687280	You always find new ways to do things.
3687280	3693280	The constraints lift, not just with the new console generation, but with every game you do.
3693280	3694280	And I agree with him.
3694280	3699280	You look at games like Crysis that maxed out all the PCs out there, basically.
3699280	3708280	Just ridiculous stuff that you throw at it because you have three graphics cards in there, high-end processor, all the RAM you could possibly throw at it.
3708280	3710280	And it runs just kind of good.
3710280	3712280	Not great, but good.
3712280	3713280	And you know why?
3713280	3716280	It's because they didn't optimize their code for shit.
3716280	3719280	And then when Crysis Wars comes out, oh, look at that!
3719280	3721280	It's the same damn game, basically.
3721280	3723280	And it runs great on all these PCs.
3723280	3724280	Wonder why that was?
3724280	3727280	Oh, it's because we actually optimized our code this time.
3727280	3743280	So really, I think that they are able to push out more code, better detail, better processing power out of these games, just by the effort and tricks that they learned along the way.
3743280	3756280	Learn to optimize their code, learn to optimize their engines that they run in, and just kind of figure out ways to use every bit of the console's power.
3756280	3763280	You know, it's interesting because it's challenging people to kind of think within the constraints that you might already have.
3763280	3765280	You know, you've got to innovate with what you've already got.
3765280	3771280	It kind of makes me think about why do games still continue to come out for the Dreamcast and all this?
3771280	3775280	Because there's a big independence scene on the Dreamcast, not necessarily because they're putting out better games.
3775280	3780280	But I think a better example would be looking at what we're seeing this year for the Wii.
3780280	3784280	I mean, look at Red Steel 2.
3784280	3786280	I mean, Red Steel 2 looks awesome.
3786280	3788280	It runs at 60 frames per second.
3788280	3790280	The graphics are pretty great on it.
3790280	3796280	I mean, it looks like something that could probably be on a 360 or a PS3, but they're doing it on the Wii.
3796280	3803280	And before, you know, no one thought that that was possible, even with something like the Metroid Other M.
3803280	3808280	I mean, that looks like that could be easily on a 360 or something like that, at least from the videos I've seen.
3808280	3811280	And some of these other games look really good.
3811280	3814280	They're running at 60 frames per second and stuff like that on the Wii.
3814280	3821280	You know, a big one that was, I want to say, the Conduit.
3821280	3826280	The Conduit's another one that pushed the engine really well on the Wii.
3826280	3827280	And they said, oh yeah, we maxed it out.
3827280	3833280	But guess what? They came out with some better games now, other games that they're coming out after Conduit.
3833280	3836280	And they're even better.
3836280	3841280	Well, you mentioning Metroid made me think of F-Zero on the GameCube, and I love F-Zero.
3841280	3845280	I think that was just an awesome game, especially that particular one that was on the GameCube.
3845280	3850280	And it looked great, and at the time did something that was almost unheard of on the GameCube.
3850280	3856280	It supported widescreen 480 progression, the same resolution that the Wii does.
3856280	3861280	Yet, I see so many Wii games that don't look as good as F-Zero GX did.
3861280	3863280	PlayStation 2, there was Gran Turismo 4.
3863280	3868280	It supported 1080i on the PlayStation 2.
3868280	3871280	Wow, I didn't even realize that.
3871280	3877280	Who's to say that these consoles, who's to say that you couldn't develop a Wii game that could support those higher resolutions?
3877280	3883280	They could do it. I mean, hell, if a PlayStation 2 can do it, why can't the Wii? It's got better specs in it.
3883280	3887280	Well, maybe, well, for one, the Wii has no HDMI, but I guess they do have that particular output.
3887280	3889280	It doesn't matter. They have component out.
3889280	3890280	Interesting. I don't know.
3890280	3894280	You could do 1080p over component. Or just do 1080i. Or even, let's just, naive...
3894280	3898280	I don't know enough about the tech end to really know. Is there something within the hardware that has to enable it?
3898280	3909280	It's memory bandwidth. Basically, you're limited to the memory, the video memory, and the video processor for those consoles to be able to push out textures and stuff like that.
3909280	3912280	But I think maybe 720p, maybe that's doable.
3912280	3918280	And if you want to call us on this topic about consoles pushing their limits, do they still have a ways to go or what have you?
3918280	3922280	1877 game OLR is the number to call. Or chat.org.
3922280	3932280	Or you can do better resolution, like 720p, but maybe Letterbox is down some so that it's not using as much RAM, maybe.
3932280	3936280	Just black bars on top and bottom or something like that.
3936280	3943280	But maybe a hybrid resolution, like 540p or something weird. I don't know. Maybe that's possible.
3943280	3952280	Tigerclaw in chat says, you can do 1080p over component if the TV supports it. Most TV won't allow 1080p over component because it doesn't support HDCP.
3952280	3958280	That's fine. But let's just do 720p then, for argument's sake. Because 720 still looks great.
3958280	3967280	It's interesting because a lot of these, you gotta be careful too. There's a lot of cheap HDTVs out there. They're only capable of 720. They don't even do the 1080 at all.
3967280	3975280	But yeah, 720 is still considered HD. Right? So what's to say you can't do 720 on the Wii?
3975280	3977280	It'd be interesting if that's possible.
3977280	3984280	It's really just forward thinking and I don't think that they're gonna do that because, guess what, they think that their audience doesn't care.
3984280	3991280	And that's sad because they could do that and they could push the technology to maybe do that.
3991280	4001280	And this one comment here is gonna take this conversation in a different direction. Watch this. Gameguru in chat says, graphical power is overrated.
4001280	4010280	Yes, Wii's new AV port has four connections that aren't used. But go back to, graphical power is overrated. Isn't that what this is really all about in a way though?
4010280	4017280	Is that, do you really have to have the most cutting edge? Do we even really need this talk about HD on the Wii and all this stuff?
4017280	4020280	Shouldn't we just have the fun game?
4020280	4024280	True, but that's also how they're getting around some of this stuff too.
4024280	4032280	Because you'll notice, like Mad World, full 3D game, ran pretty good. Black and white, that's the way they got around.
4032280	4037280	It's a different art style so they didn't have to push the detail and stuff like that.
4037280	4041280	Red Steel 2, they're going with a comic book or maybe cel shaded look to it.
4041280	4048280	Another way that they've gotten around having to have really detailed textures and stuff like that, you save on texture memory that way.
4048280	4051280	I was thinking more like, games don't have to have great graphics to be fun.
4051280	4057280	They don't, but you should be able to do that if you're a developer and you want to push that out.
4057280	4063280	For real, how many fucking people are playing that Plants vs. Zombies game from PopCap right now?
4063280	4064280	Too many.
4064280	4071280	Billions and billions of people are playing that Plants vs. Zombies, creating zombies, that game is.
4071280	4077280	Not the greatest graphics in the world, a game that probably could have come out on the Super Nintendo, right?
4077280	4078280	Yes.
4078280	4084280	But, huge. And it adapts to so many different types of audiences too.
4084280	4092280	You know what I mean? Soccer moms play this on their break at work and even some of the hardcore gamers are all about plants and zombies.
4092280	4098280	When we went to that Windows 7 demo thingy at E3 that was off site, you know what one of those guys was testing out on the computer?
4098280	4100280	Plants vs. Zombies.
4100280	4107280	Yeah, exactly. And you know what would be funny, and I've always been saying this, why can't they take the Wii and say, give us a 2D Metroid?
4107280	4112280	Just, you know, that way you don't even have to worry about it, you know? Hell, you could reuse the sprites.
4112280	4116280	Just make a 2D Metroid that knocks me on my fucking ass. Like, really.
4116280	4124280	Just blow me away with the sound, the story, do beautiful Joey things with the 2D graphics, I don't know, whatever.
4124280	4130280	The one game I've been playing this week more than any other is Final Fantasy IV The After Years.
4130280	4133280	The graphics on par with Super Nintendo.
4133280	4134280	Yeah.
4134280	4143280	But, I'm very interested in the story. Now granted, a lot of this is because I love Final Fantasy IV and I'm very nostalgic for it, so to have the story keep going is great.
4143280	4151280	It's great though, because think about it though, if you did that with the Wii, you could actually reuse assets. You saved development time right there.
4151280	4159280	I mean, you can reuse assets, you can create new things, but you can just, you know, build upon it. Remember Sammit, what was it, Metroid Zero or whatever?
4159280	4161280	Zero Mission, I believe.
4161280	4167280	You know, basically Super Metroid, there is some differences in there, but then there is this whole after part.
4167280	4170280	I want to read this lengthy comment from Xenocore because I think it's a good one.
4170280	4175280	As much as this guy may have a point, this quote has merit, but only as far as what the rest of the game is doing.
4175280	4181280	This console has been maxed if you consider what else the console is doing while it's rendering graphics.
4181280	4188280	If a game isn't as intensive in driving AI or keeping objects in memory, fighters have more room for graphics than a simulation does.
4188280	4193280	Chat.orangelandraday.com if you want to comment. Or 1877 game OLR.
4193280	4199280	That's true. It doesn't. I mean, you could have, it's all how they use it. All the different tricks.
4199280	4205280	I like this comment from Dan Shadow. Who cares about graphics when Scribblenauts is coming?
4205280	4209280	That's true. Scribblenauts is going to be awesome. How are they going to do a sequel to that game?
4209280	4216280	I don't know. Hey, make a game like that on Xbox or something where when you put in bacon, it's real bacon.
4216280	4220280	It doesn't look like cartoony bacon, but real bacon.
4220280	4222280	Wishful thinking?
4222280	4228280	Too bad they couldn't do like a fighting game like that. Where you're just fighting and all of a sudden you just summon different things.
4228280	4234280	You know what though? I got to admit, as much as the Scribblenauts demo made me teehee when I was watching it at E3,
4234280	4241280	I do remain a little skeptical about how fun it's really going to be. Like the longevity is what I remain skeptical about.
4241280	4250280	You got to remember folks, remember, go back in the archives of this show back to 2006, I think.
4250280	4257280	I said Nintendogs was the best thing I played at E3. It's going to be the most amazing game when it comes out.
4257280	4263280	It's going to be awesome. Just all these things you can do is just going to be amazing. Nintendogs is going to blow away your fucking mind.
4263280	4270280	And then when the game came out, bored now, two hours in. Like it was the type of game where I'd seen it all at E3.
4270280	4276280	So I just, you know, I'm not, I haven't played Scribblenauts. I'm not saying knocking it. I'm just saying, skeptical.
4276280	4281280	For me, drawing the life. Another perfect one. Oh, I can draw my character? That's awesome.
4281280	4290280	Did that, and got bored. Same developer even. But this I think will be fun, if not just the show to your friends.
4290280	4294280	Hey, look at that, huh, Cthulhu. You know, just screwing around with that. And hey, why not?
4294280	4301280	You know, they should have a game that's just like a sandbox type thing where you can just create your own scenarios, you know, do whatever.
4301280	4310280	Bandit in our chatroom asks, why is the Wii $99 for God's sake? Good question. Or why, I'm sorry, why isn't the Wii? Sorry, my bad.
4310280	4315280	Why isn't the Wii $99 for God's sake? Because they want to make money off of every console.
4315280	4322280	Yeah, I mean, because people are still buying it when it's $250. Because they're ignorant, because they think that they can, you know,
4322280	4335280	I mean, look at that. The Xbox 360 is $50 cheaper than them. But you know what? They're so arrogant, I guess, and confident in their system that they just say, eh, whatever.
4335280	4342280	We're not competing with anybody. We're not part of the next gen, remember that quote? They're not part of the next gen.
4342280	4348280	We're a different gen. But no, it really comes down to because the game is still selling. That's the reason why.
4348280	4356280	Alright, let's move on. We have a lot of ground to cover before we get to break here. And this next story is about the Xbox 360's Project Natal,
4356280	4364280	which obviously was one of the highly talked about things that you three this year. The rumor going around this week is that Xbox Natal might actually be
4364280	4375280	the next Microsoft console. It might not be something that you buy to enhance with your 360, but it might actually be a whole new type of console.
4375280	4382280	Where does this come from? Well, this comes from a story reported on OneUp.com through their Listen Up podcast.
4382280	4392280	They were talking about Project Natal and some of the folks were talking about the games. And apparently, Microsoft is not only planning on releasing Natal as an add-on for the Xbox 360,
4392280	4400280	but possibly releasing it as standard with the next Xbox console. But they're saying this new console is not just going to be, like it's not a repackaging.
4400280	4408280	It's not a new SKU. It's not the power set that comes with more than just the thing itself.
4408280	4419280	But that they're talking about that this new Xbox could actually be called Xbox Natal and that it's going to be having some added oomph actually in the system itself.
4419280	4428280	You see rumors going around about how Xbox is going to have these new chipsets in them soon that apparently they're not going to be making as much noise.
4428280	4436280	They're combining the GPU and all this into one chipset so that it won't be as noisy and they can make the size go down a little bit.
4436280	4441280	So that maybe the Xbox 360 Slim is actually going to be this whole new console.
4441280	4449280	Loki, what do you think? I mean, it makes sense that they might redesign the console to be smaller. I don't think it's going to be the next console though.
4449280	4456280	I don't think they're going to increase the specs on it or anything because they can't because they would alienate half their audience basically.
4456280	4466280	I do think that maybe later on if this takes off like they think it's going to take off, then yeah, it probably will be bundled with all the Xbox 360 consoles as they come out.
4466280	4473280	It'll be just like a controller. I mean, that sounds right. I think a lot of people are getting caught off guard with the whole,
4473280	4478280	we're going to treat the Natal launch like we're going to treat a console launch.
4478280	4480280	That they're going to put a lot of marketing buzz behind it.
4480280	4487280	Yeah, it kind of is a big thing because if it does exactly what it's showing that it's supposed to be able to do, then yeah, that is a big thing.
4487280	4492280	That might get a lot of people interested and they really want to take away that market share that the Wii has.
4492280	4499280	And maybe possibly capture some of these people that have never played games before because that's what kind of the Wii did.
4499280	4505280	It's like, oh my god, I can play tennis like I can play tennis. Or I can bowl like I can really bowl.
4505280	4511280	But this is like, I can bowl and I don't need the whole controller. I don't even need to figure that out. I just do it.
4511280	4515280	Well now, here's something else to consider where they're going with this.
4515280	4521280	Why has the Wii been so successful? Because they've been catering to the soccer moms, to the family audience.
4521280	4528280	Now, there are rumors out there, and I say believe them, that Nintendo's coming out with a new Wii in 2011.
4528280	4532280	Wii HD. There's rumors about behind closed doors, showing to companies, and so on.
4532280	4536280	And I say believe them. Nintendo's the one that's got some catching up to do.
4536280	4543280	You know, if they don't think two steps ahead, they're going to get blown away by some of these new developments in the 360, especially with the 360's price point.
4543280	4552280	And here's the thing is that, let's say 360 relaunches this thing, and now they sell a slim Xbox that has Natal in it,
4552280	4560280	that is catered at a family audience, at a lower price point possibly, or an equal price point with the Nintendo Wii.
4560280	4570280	Now Nintendo's in trouble. So I think it's very interesting, you know, obviously, Microsoft is not content with being number two, or whatever they are right now.
4570280	4575280	I mean, I guess it's arguable, you look at the world picture, whatever. They are not, but they're not in America.
4575280	4576280	In the world.
4576280	4577280	Are they really?
4577280	4578280	Yeah.
4578280	4579280	But like Japan, they're certainly not.
4579280	4582280	Well yeah, but you know, that doesn't matter, their market share is really small.
4582280	4589280	Okay, well whatever, I don't want to get into, this isn't about 360 versus Sony right now, this is about Microsoft wanting to be number one.
4589280	4597280	And they're looking at how did Nintendo do it, and watch, when this thing launches, this is tall, it's going to be launched at families again.
4597280	4604280	But it's going to be interesting, because now they will still have that whole hardcore gamer, whereas Wii's going to be going in reverse.
4604280	4609280	They'll already probably have the buy-in from the family audience, they're going to need to get the hardcore gamers back on board.
4609280	4616280	That's really going to be tough, because I think Microsoft gets it though, because if you think about it, look at what they're showing off.
4616280	4620280	All the games that they're showing off are really to their core audience that's already there.
4620280	4626280	Games that everybody that I think owns the 360, for the most part, that's going to be something that you're going to be excited about.
4626280	4631280	Now, Natal is really kind of just to gather those people that may be on the Wii and stuff.
4631280	4644280	But the Wii, everybody that owns it, I mean granted there's games that you're looking forward to, but I know myself, I'm not going to be, other than Metroid, other M, and that's kind of iffy on that one.
4644280	4649280	I don't have faith in them that they're going to really put out something that's going to make me go,
4649280	4660280	Oh my god, this is so awesome, this is the greatest game I have ever played, you know, type thing. I think they're just going to keep churning this crap that's been coming out year after year.
4660280	4668280	Aimed at more family gamers, and good for them if they think that's what they need to do, but as far as my budget goes, I'm not spending money on this.
4668280	4677280	So much in chat I want to cover right now. Chat.orensonsheridge.com, and if you want to call in, please do 1-877-GAMEOLR if you want to talk about Project Natal and this whole rumor about the new system.
4677280	4688280	Oh god, where to even begin here, there's so much I want to talk about. First off, folks in chat say, Wii HD next year, no no no, 2011 is when they're saying it's coming out.
4688280	4693280	But Game Guru in chat says, no I don't see Wii HD coming out until the next generation.
4693280	4697280	But what I want to say to that is, who's to say where the generations are anymore?
4697280	4709280	I mean, what's interesting about what we've got with this current crop of systems is that they are entertainment devices in your living room, especially PlayStation 3.
4709280	4716280	You know, their biggest thing right now is the fact that it's a Blu-Ray player, and does a lot of these things right out of the living room.
4716280	4721280	You know, who's to say where the next generation is even going to begin?
4721280	4734280	Because we have yet to really max out this generation in some ways, but I don't know if there's necessarily going to be a hard line that defines the next generation of gaming after this one, I guess is what I'm getting at.
4734280	4739280	Because right now the war is about enhancing this current one, which we didn't really have before.
4739280	4744280	You know, when you had a Super Nintendo, you might have the occasional peripheral to enhance it, but that's it.
4744280	4751280	It's basically now they're trying to push their consoles to a 10-year life cycle, is really what it is.
4751280	4756280	And if that's the case, then we're going to be playing with the Xbox 360 until 2015.
4756280	4767280	So, you know, they've got to do something now because they're not necessarily running out of ideas, but they need to expand the possibilities with these new platforms.
4767280	4775280	So you're going to see stuff like the motion controllers coming out from Sony and from Microsoft, and you're going to see the enhancements to the console from the Wii.
4775280	4782280	Because it's technically not a new system, it's just an enhancement, like the DS and the DSi and the DS Lite.
4782280	4785280	Okay, I got to say this, I got to say this, because this is it right here.
4785280	4791280	GameGuru says, admittedly, it might be the next generation with MotionPlus, Natal, and PSMote.
4791280	4797280	And I'm almost on board with you there, but change MotionPlus to Wii HD, and there you have it.
4797280	4800280	That's why I do think Wii HD is out sooner than later.
4800280	4802280	What is this all about? Leveling the playfield.
4802280	4806280	Xbox, Sony will now have motion control.
4806280	4808280	Wii will now have high definition.
4808280	4811280	Now it's a war.
4811280	4813280	Now it's a war.
4813280	4822280	GameGuru also says in chat, and I'm sorry to keep quoting from the same person, but just a lot of thought-provoking comments, so props to you.
4822280	4825280	However, a price drop is due by 2010.
4825280	4829280	Natal will bomb with the Family Gamer, Xbox has its stereotype.
4829280	4831280	I couldn't disagree more.
4831280	4834280	Not necessarily that Natal will bomb with the Family Gamer, I don't know yet.
4834280	4837280	It's too early to see until we start really seeing the games.
4837280	4841280	You can't base everything off the Milo demo and some of these limited things we saw.
4841280	4844280	But Xbox having a stereotype to overcome, they can do it.
4844280	4846280	Hell yeah, they can do it.
4846280	4848280	And I'm not trying to sound like a fanboy or anything.
4848280	4850280	I'm saying, you go back.
4850280	4854280	The nice thing about this show being around for seven years, you go back to some of those older episodes.
4854280	4856280	My God, did we make fun of the Xbox.
4856280	4858280	Oh my God, the X-Brick.
4858280	4860280	What a fat system.
4860280	4861280	What a useless system.
4861280	4863280	There isn't a fucking game on it I want to play.
4863280	4864280	This is a piece of shit.
4864280	4866280	Who wants to buy this console?
4866280	4868280	This is just a PC in a box.
4868280	4870280	There's not a damn thing on this worth playing.
4870280	4877280	These are things that I'm sure we all said about that original, black, gigantic Xbox One.
4877280	4879280	But look how far they've come.
4879280	4881280	They won me over.
4881280	4886280	One of the games I played this week, which I didn't even get to in my gaming week, One vs. 100.
4886280	4890280	Which, I don't know how much I've ranted on this show before.
4890280	4896280	I want to see those Berkeley Systems games make a comeback, like Acrophobia and some of these other games used to be on Berkeley Systems.
4896280	4897280	That's what this is.
4897280	4899280	One vs. 100 is the Berkeley Systems games.
4899280	4901280	That's exactly what it is.
4901280	4904280	That's what I felt when I was playing it and everything.
4904280	4906280	That's exactly what it is.
4906280	4908280	Somebody at Microsoft is listening to this show or is thinking.
4908280	4910280	Or we share the same genes.
4910280	4913280	Because that is exactly what One vs. 100 is.
4913280	4915280	But it's like that in the next generation.
4915280	4917280	But see, that's the thing.
4917280	4923280	Microsoft, they're really not going to have much to overcome because they've got something for everybody.
4923280	4932280	They've got now these community games, One vs. 100 and stuff like that that's going to appeal to people that like watching game shows and stuff like that.
4932280	4937280	Hey, do you think maybe they might try marketing that to elderly people that like watching game shows?
4937280	4939280	Hey, now you can be on your favorite game show.
4939280	4942280	Wheel of Fortune, oh my god, that's going to totally be one of you.
4942280	4945280	It's not going to end with One vs. 100, by the way.
4945280	4946280	Here's my prediction.
4946280	4948280	I'm throwing this out here right now.
4948280	4954280	You know how they've always talked about Xbox Gold is going to be going away in favor of some of these other perks?
4954280	4957280	Because how can they otherwise compete with Sony?
4957280	4962280	Sony makes a pretty damn good argument when they say you don't have to pay for our online gaming.
4962280	4967280	Microsoft's going to make online gaming and Halo and shit free before you know it.
4967280	4969280	And you know what it is?
4969280	4971280	This is what you're going to be paying for.
4971280	4976280	These gold games and these extra services and the live hosts and the prizes and all this stuff.
4976280	4983280	Xbox has finally conned you into buying something like a membership to Pogo.com or one of those sites.
4983280	4987280	You know, where you play the online games for cash and prizes and stuff.
4987280	4989280	And that's just the first one that popped in my mind.
4989280	4991280	But there's tons of these sites out there.
4991280	4993280	That's what the Xbox is going to be.
4993280	4999280	And they won't take half the shit that a lot of the people say when they talk about those other sites.
4999280	5001280	Watch. Watch.
5001280	5004280	That's what's going to happen with Xbox Live Gold.
5004280	5006280	I don't know about that.
5006280	5011280	That's a prediction, not a fact, but I could definitely see that happening.
5011280	5018280	They've got a lot with their streaming and Netflix, the social networking stuff now.
5018280	5024280	You have Xbox Live Arcade, the independent games now, the community games.
5024280	5028280	Xbox Originals, you can download full games on there now.
5028280	5031280	You can play your DVDs, all that stuff.
5031280	5034280	So it's basically an entertainment console.
5034280	5038280	Now you go to the Wii and you can play games on it.
5038280	5041280	You can send a message to your friends.
5041280	5043280	That's about it.
5043280	5045280	I mean, it's really limited.
5045280	5051280	I mean, you can play retro games and stuff like that, but it's really limited as far as the entertainment value.
5051280	5054280	I mean, it's really just a gaming console.
5054280	5057280	But, I mean, maybe this Wii HD will change all that.
5057280	5060280	Maybe they will hopefully fix their online network.
5060280	5062280	All right, I've got to read a couple more chats and then we've got to move on.
5062280	5066280	Unfortunately, I think we're finding that when we allow ourselves to talk more about stories,
5066280	5068280	we talk about them for like 20 minutes at a time.
5068280	5072280	We're almost an hour and a half in and we've still got mail bags slated for this segment.
5072280	5074280	But I do want to read a couple more comments.
5074280	5077280	There's a great talk in chat.orangeonchurch.com tonight.
5077280	5082280	sj100matt says, with the economy the way it is, some of us can't keep buying this updated shit.
5082280	5085280	Granted, this recession isn't forever, for all we know.
5085280	5087280	Yeah, wishful thinking. Let's hope you're right.
5087280	5091280	But releasing the next new console isn't going to get the consumer to buy at this time.
5091280	5096280	And then sj100matt continues in response to when I said the real war is coming.
5096280	5098280	He says, well, fuck their war.
5098280	5101280	I'm not going to fund it unless they make it worth my while.
5101280	5109280	And that's a very good retort is that these things are only as good as the games that are on it,
5109280	5111280	as we've always said.
5111280	5114280	But something to think about, though, because you talk about the economy and all of that.
5114280	5118280	Keep in mind, entertainment is one of the things that manages to persevere through the economy.
5118280	5121280	You know, the movie industry, look at those movies that are out right now.
5121280	5124280	Granted, there's been little dips in the movie industry,
5124280	5127280	but not the major types of dips you would see in an economy like this,
5127280	5130280	especially when ticket prices are still rising.
5130280	5133280	Yeah, entertainment's not really hurting as bad.
5133280	5135280	Although they claim that they are.
5135280	5138280	A lot of people are willing to pay top dollar for entertainment.
5138280	5142280	But not to devalue what he's saying, because I think the argument is still a valid one,
5142280	5147280	is that, yeah, you still got to convince me that it's worth it to upgrade to a Wii HD.
5147280	5151280	But Nintendo, the thing about Nintendo, you know what they've got in their back pocket?
5151280	5155280	Mario, Zelda, Metroid, the characters you love.
5155280	5157280	That's what they're holding in their back pocket.
5157280	5159280	And people that will buy anything that says Nintendo on it.
5159280	5163280	And all they have to do is show, hey, look, it's Link in HD.
5163280	5165280	Boom! Instant fanboy boner in sales.
5165280	5169280	And myself being one of them, I'm in line.
5169280	5172280	I think a lot of us will be.
5172280	5173280	Yeah.
5173280	5176280	Let's face it, Nintendo taught us at age seven.
5176280	5180280	You love Mario, and you love Link, and you love these games.
5180280	5182280	And they will be with you forever.
5182280	5186280	I'm loving Mario a lot less lately, though. I just have to say that.
5186280	5187280	I don't know.
5187280	5190280	Not buying that new Super Mario Brothers game, sorry.
5190280	5194280	I'm not in it now because I don't have the friends to play with on the regular basis.
5194280	5197280	I can't buy new Super Mario Brothers because I don't have enough friends.
5197280	5199280	That's what it boils down to.
5199280	5202280	So, yeah.
5202280	5204280	Totally changed topic.
5204280	5214280	EA, apparently, they've drawn some attention from, I guess, their prote-
5214280	5217280	Not even really a real protest. It's a fake protest.
5217280	5220280	At E3, they had protesters out front.
5220280	5221280	Did you see it?
5221280	5223280	Yeah, I saw it. I saw the protesters.
5223280	5224280	Did you think it was real at first?
5224280	5226280	Nope, not at all.
5226280	5230280	I had a moment of hesitation because I was looking at it, and I was walking by,
5230280	5233280	and I was thinking, you know, with the crazies in this state, I almost believe it.
5233280	5237280	You know, as I was kind of walking by, I was like, oh, my God.
5237280	5239280	This is kind of cool.
5239280	5241280	Like, the crazies are out here protesting E3.
5241280	5242280	This is awesome.
5242280	5245280	But then as I was walking in the hall, and I started to post about it to the OLR Twitter,
5245280	5249280	because you might remember at E3, I was letting the folks on Twitter control what I was looking at,
5249280	5250280	and I started to tweet about it.
5250280	5253280	And as I was doing it, I was thinking, you know what?
5253280	5256280	They had, like, the EA logo on one of those boards, and some of these...
5256280	5259280	These guys knew way too much about games.
5259280	5262280	Oh, my... I just bought it, hook, line, and sinker.
5262280	5267280	This protest was something that was staged for some game I haven't even been following.
5267280	5272280	Yeah, and in fact, that wasn't the only person who bought that hook, line, and sinker.
5272280	5282280	Apparently, the bloggers at LA Times, who basically wrote that the protesters promoted a multimedia anti-game website,
5282280	5291280	the EA reps, of course, later confirmed to the Associated Press that the whole affair was staged by a marketing agency.
5291280	5298280	It says now, apparently, game politics, they're pointing out that the stunt has angered many real Catholic bloggers.
5298280	5302280	Margaret Cabaniss of Inside Catholic wrote,
5302280	5312280	It's been clear for a while now that the entertainment industry views Christians on the whole as priggish, thin-skinned funkillers.
5312280	5317280	Has anybody at EA actually read The Inferno?
5317280	5321280	I'm sorry, but that's kind of funny.
5321280	5331280	Another blogger, I guess, at Catholic Video Games wrote that gamers of all varieties will buy this product if it's, well, actually a good game.
5331280	5337280	So instead of engaging in a shameless anti-Christian stunt to promote your poor excuse of a product,
5337280	5346280	you might ought to work on making this game something better than a blatant God of War ripoff and make it something worthwhile.
5346280	5351280	That second guy's actually got a good point, because yeah, it is a blatant God of War ripoff.
5351280	5356280	But from the people I talked to that saw the game, it was behind closed doors, we weren't special enough to see it,
5356280	5359280	but some of the people I talked to that saw it said, hey, it looks really good.
5359280	5364280	Well, yeah, God of War is awesome. I mean, if a game blatantly rips it off, it's going to be fun, so I mean, why not?
5364280	5371280	And yeah, I do have to laugh, because I do see Catholics, unfortunately, that way. Being a Catholic myself, I, yeah.
5371280	5377280	And now I'm thinking back on the whole thing, and I'm kind of like, oh my gosh, I was so stupid to even believe it for like a minute,
5377280	5381280	because one of those people, I swear to God, was dressed in the Puritan outfit.
5381280	5390280	Like, the fucking Salem witch trials, like, out there, you know, in the fucking, like, churning the butter outfit. Burn the witch! Burn the witch!
5390280	5392280	Well, you should know, we should...
5392280	5400280	And I should, I, but, here's, here's what I ask you guys. Should you be mad that they did it, or should you be mad that people believed it?
5400280	5407280	That it actually was happening for a minute? Because unfortunately, with some of these other things that sometimes you hear about the way,
5407280	5415280	and I'm not talking about, you know, most people are pretty normal, but that, you know, unfortunately, there are 52% of the population in California
5415280	5421280	that have bought into this whole thing that it's okay for, you know, religion to take away some of these rights and all this stuff,
5421280	5429280	you know, because of all of this and all these other... There's many of us that believed for a minute it was true! Isn't that something to be concerned about?
5429280	5437280	No. And, you know, at the same time, I think this whole, you know, stunt, it didn't really do anything other than draw attention to, obviously, the game,
5437280	5441280	which is what they're hoping that it would, but it's not like the protest was,
5441280	5448280	oh my god, there's so much full-frontal nudity in this game, it's unbelievable! And the violence and sex is just crazy!
5448280	5453280	You know, then people would be like, oh, I gotta play this game, you know? Like, I would have been like, tell me more!
5453280	5464280	But, no, it's just like, oh, there's the devil in this game. Really? Dante's Inferno, there's the devil in it, and evil, and oh my god, that's so unexpected.
5464280	5472280	Well, when I walked by, I thought those people were protesting E3, and I was like, oh my gosh, and I could totally see the people out there.
5472280	5478280	I mean, you know, there are these sick, sick people out there that, well, I shouldn't even mention it,
5478280	5483280	because, you know, after what I just said, I wouldn't want to compare the two, because there's these obvious loons
5483280	5490280	that go out there and protest these weddings, and not weddings, but funerals of people that have served for our country,
5490280	5495280	and that they'll protest these funerals, I'm not even going to say who they are, because I don't want to give them attention,
5495280	5501280	but they go out and protest these funerals of soldiers who died in the war, saying, this is because we have fags in America,
5501280	5510280	that this soldier died and is burning in hell at this very moment. I mean, clearly crazed people out there doing it,
5510280	5515280	and so I thought maybe E3 actually got a little bit of that, like, hey, Jack Thompson got his buddies together.
5515280	5520280	You know, why did they even bother? They should have just tipped off the right people, you know, about that stuff,
5520280	5526280	that they could have had actual, you know, protesters out there, but, do we have anyone that wants to comment on this?
5526280	5531280	1-877-GAME-OLR. Did you think it was real? Did you buy into this for a minute? I want to know.
5531280	5533280	Or are you Catholic and pissed off?
5533280	5540280	Do you not remember when we did a protest, or we were kind of observing of a protest for booth babes back in 2006?
5540280	5542280	And that was all just a play for...
5542280	5545280	That was all hoax, too, and that got picked up by a lot of bloggers.
5545280	5548280	But nobody went to the outpost, because wasn't that Scott's outpost?
5548280	5549280	Yes, it was.
5549280	5550280	And nobody went.
5550280	5553280	Well, that part of the plan failed, but it still got picked up.
5553280	5557280	I shouldn't say nobody. He had a decent crowd, but I think they were hoping for a little more, you know what I mean?
5557280	5564280	Yes, part B of the plan, not exactly executed correctly, but the part A part did quite well.
5564280	5569280	It got picked up on the blogs, because, hey, guess what, they're booth babes, or, you know, babes that are carrying signs,
5569280	5576280	and, hey, it's a story and a pretty picture that go along with the story. Awesome.
5576280	5582280	But, yeah, I think, I mean, the game itself, the whole protest thing seems unnecessary.
5582280	5588280	But they should have had his devil's ring around. That'd be kind of cool. The signs.
5588280	5597280	SSTA 100 Matt says, you know, Rob, not to get off topic, but the church's private organizations are running the same hate ads on the radio in New York for anti-gay marriage legislation.
5597280	5600280	Let me respond to this in a minute, because we're getting a call.
5600280	5603280	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?
5603280	5604280	This is Leo Shen.
5604280	5611280	Hey, Leo Shen, what's on your mind? This whole Dante's Inferno protesting. Is this offensive? Is it funny? Did you believe it?
5611280	5620280	I actually found it hilarious, because I went to Fanime not too long ago, and there was actually protesters protesting Fanime.
5620280	5631280	Really? Oh my gosh. Okay, I've been to Fanime. I've not seen the protesters. And it was the real deal? What were they saying? Cosplayers need to put down the cosplay and read the Bible?
5631280	5643280	I'm not too sure, because I was looking at them from a distance, but I guess they were protesting against, like, you know, hentai and all that stuff against the anime porn.
5643280	5652280	But the really funny thing was they had a cosplayer who came as Jesus to the anime convention, and he just went out there, and it was just hilarious.
5652280	5658280	There's always somebody that's got to push the buttons. Did the protesters respond to the man in the Jesus cosplay?
5658280	5667280	They just ignored him. And they had this other cosplayer who came out as Jesus, but as a raptor dinosaur.
5667280	5674280	Wait, Jesus is a raptor dinosaur? How does that even work? Even I think I'm offended by that one.
5674280	5679280	It's called 4chan. The fouls of the internet.
5679280	5686280	The home of internet offensiveness. Alright, I understand. Well, thank you, Leo Shen, for the call. And thank you very much. I'm going to let you go.
5686280	5696280	But, you know, just thinking about the whole, you know, again, protesters were at Fanime. Why can't they be at E3?
5696280	5704280	Anyway, I wanted to respond to this real quick, because, yes, it is a little off topic, but I need to say something, because obviously, you know, being gay myself, I have a whole lot to say on this.
5704280	5714280	SJ100Matt says, you know, Rob, not to get off topic, but the same churches, private organizations are running the same hate ads on the radio in New York for anti-gay marriage legislation.
5714280	5725280	So, again, this just goes back to the whole, that's why I believed it when you had the chick in the Puritan outfit there with the sign that says, you know, Dante's Inferno, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
5725280	5736280	Because when I see these ads and I hear these hate speech and stuff like that on the radio about, you know, withholding people's rights, when it's in the goddamn Constitution on the 14th Amendment,
5736280	5744280	no state shall pass a law that robs people of the pursuit to life, liberty, et cetera, et cetera.
5744280	5754280	Okay? Like, when I see these ads, that's what I hear in my head. Burn the witch! Burn them! Throw them in the river, see if they float! Don't give them any rights!
5754280	5758280	It's the archaic way of thinking. It's always something.
5758280	5766280	Sorry if I'm getting a little too personal and political for you, but deal. You know, this is, you know, my rights that are being affected here.
5766280	5770280	When have I ever shut up about that topic on the show?
5770280	5773280	All right, anything else to say about the protest, Loki?
5773280	5776280	Uh, no, it was retarded looking.
5776280	5783280	I mean, the whole thing was a little silly, but I will admit, I believed it for like half a second. I really did.
5783280	5789280	All right. Usually at the end of Part A, we would do the Classic Game of the Week, but unfortunately, Dark Sakura is not here.
5789280	5794280	She will be here. We're anticipating during the next part of the show, so in the meantime, we need to get into the mailbag.
5794280	5798280	We're going to switch out mailbag and do it during Part A tonight, so let's open up the mail.
5798280	5808280	Mailbag at Orangelaungerator.com if you want to send us an email. That's the place to go, and we're always curious about your thoughts.
5808280	5815280	GeneralGurdover sent us an email wanting us to check out their podcast.
5815280	5820280	Well, I haven't checked it out yet. Sadly, I'm behind on the email, but nun2k.com.
5820280	5825280	I'm always one to support independent podcasters. I hope that wasn't a porn ad or something in disguise.
5825280	5829280	Will somebody please check that website out and let me make sure it is a legitimate indie podcast for me?
5829280	5838280	I want to read this email. This email comes to us from... I don't want to read the real name there.
5838280	5844280	I don't think there is a real name. I will say the email says Nutman, so we'll call this person Nutman.
5844280	5849280	Loki, can you please not yell so much?
5849280	5850280	No, I can't.
5850280	5858280	I had to turn down the volume almost ten times in episode 326 because Loki was yelling so loudly, it was hurting my ears.
5858280	5860280	You can't be alone in this, right?
5860280	5863280	P.S. O.L.R. is awesome, as is Loki.
5863280	5865280	I guess you just need to turn it down a little bit, Loki.
5865280	5870280	This could be a problem that we've moved studios. We unhook and hook up the mics every week.
5870280	5875280	We do rely on the live listeners to tell us if things sound way too crazy.
5875280	5878280	Live listeners, if we are too loud, let us know, please.
5878280	5884280	We'd be happy to turn down the volume a little bit so you guys don't have to suffer so much.
5884280	5890280	Loki's yelled for seven years. That's his thing on the show, if you haven't figured that out by now.
5890280	5894280	That's not yelling. I don't know what you're talking about.
5894280	5899280	Well, I'm not talking about yelling like you might yell at somebody you're mad at, but I'm talking about you do have angry white man voice.
5899280	5906280	That's just your last name, angry white man voice.
5906280	5910280	He has angry white man voice, that's right.
5910280	5914280	But, yeah, we'll try to make sure it doesn't get out of control.
5914280	5919280	So, chatters, please feel free to speak up if Loki is getting too loud.
5919280	5922280	Let's see, we got a lot of emails this week.
5922280	5926280	This comes to us from J-Rod.
5926280	5930280	Hey, O.L.R. folks, I'm writing in a comment on Left 4 Dead 2 boycott.
5930280	5936280	I want to stand on the other side of the fence from all the opinions in the O.L.R. studio just for argument's sake.
5936280	5940280	I'm not one of the people who are butthurt about this, but I can understand why people are pissed.
5940280	5944280	I agree that the game is coming out way too soon since the first one was just released in November.
5944280	5953280	The reason people are pissed isn't because they are spoiled, it's because they expect more from Valve with integrity compared to, say, Activision in regards to putting out sequels for a cash grab.
5953280	5963280	The reason people support Valve by buying up their games and having such consumer loyalty is because Valve always takes care of their customers with free updates, content, and product support.
5963280	5978280	Personally, I think they could have put all this content into the first game with a huge update, but this sequel reeks of Microsoft holding a leash because they won't allow free stuff on Xbox Live, the same way they forced Epic to charge for map packs in Gears of War 2 that Epic intended to be free.
5978280	5990280	To address Loki's statement on huge E3 lines for the game and how everyone is going to buy it, that's fine and dandy, but I don't expect to hear any whining when everyone buys piles upon piles of the newest Guitar Hero and Wii Fit sports games.
5990280	5993280	Which is funny because we just whined about that earlier in the show.
5993280	6003280	Also, one more shorter point. Everyone at the OLR Studio seems to be taking a crap on Sony for their lack of content for this year. Have you all completely missed Sony's biggest release of the year, Infamous?
6003280	6010280	I'm actually surprised to hear nobody on the show talking about it because it's a very big PS3 exclusive release put out by Sucker Punch.
6010280	6018280	PS, $250 for a PSP. Apparently cocaine is a hell of a drug. This email is sponsored by the Olive Garden Home of the Never Ending Salad and Breadsticks.
6018280	6024280	Yeah, I heard about Infamous. I'm well aware of it being out and unfortunately, though, I'm playing Prototype, which is almost...
6024280	6028280	I mean, it's not identical, but I mean, it's the same type of gameplay right now.
6028280	6036280	And I think you didn't hear us say anything about it because the game, like, came out. So there wasn't really a lot of, like, hubub about it at E3. It was, you know, more of...
6036280	6037280	They had it there.
6037280	6043280	I think they had it there, but it was just, you know, people weren't really paying attention to that because they're like, hey, this is out next week. Let's look at, you know, all this other stuff.
6043280	6049280	And then it seemed like, I think, part of the point you were trying to make last week is that it seemed like there was this huge gap in the rest of 2009.
6049280	6056280	And then we've got all this stuff that's supposed to come out in 2010. Although it does seem like, you know, we'll be peppered with a few nice things here and there.
6056280	6065280	Yeah, I mean, Infamous looks good. I'm planning on picking up maybe later on, but like I mentioned earlier, I have, like, two PlayStation 3 games, though, that have come out back in.
6065280	6074280	One in November, one in, you know, the end of February that I'm still waiting to play. And I've just... I'm catching up.
6074280	6078280	Let's talk, though, about the other end of the more meatier part of the email about Left 4 Dead 2.
6078280	6084280	Because we did go off on quite a tangent about this game last week and, you know, talk about, you know, that people should stop whining so much.
6084280	6095280	But does he make a point that, you know, Microsoft wanted this other company to charge for their map packs? You know, is this Microsoft's influence? That it's a cash grab?
6095280	6096280	No.
6096280	6101280	I have to admit, although I respect the points brought up in this email, my opinion has not changed.
6101280	6102280	I don't think it's Microsoft's fault.
6102280	6104280	And I don't think it can change until the game comes out.
6104280	6121280	I think it's EA's fault. Because EA would be the publisher. And at the same time, though, they're saying, oh, well, we've made enhancements to the AI, to the director, and there's stuff that we couldn't have done in Left 4 Dead 1 and stuff.
6121280	6126280	And really, in the end, it's the developer deciding to do it or not.
6126280	6141280	I mean, because they don't have to. And we're talking download content, you know, they could put out those enhancements, you know, the map packs and stuff like that for Left 4 Dead or, you know, other stuff, maybe Team Fortress 2 and stuff, maybe add, you know, sell it.
6141280	6152280	They could put that stuff out. But, you know, if it's, you know, the fact that it's being, you know, that they won't let them put it out for free, well, that's still an excuse because they can always put it out for as cheap as possible, you know.
6152280	6164280	Here's my biggest thing. This is why I don't get it yet, and why I'm not on board with you guys yet, because the game isn't out. And there's still a long way to go before the holiday, and we don't really know the full potential of this game just yet.
6164280	6174280	Granted, we got a lot of details out of E3 and so forth. Here's why I don't like these Guitar Hero games upon game. They feel like cheap re-skinning of the previous game.
6174280	6185280	But you'll notice we haven't said any of that about Beatles Rock Band. We've lavished praise upon praise upon where this game's going, because it does feel like a completely unique, justifiably separately purchased game.
6185280	6193280	And if Left 4 Dead 2 ultimately is that at the end, I don't think you guys, you know, whether this could have been an update or not, have much to stand on.
6193280	6204280	However, if the game is a cheap re-skinning of Left 4 Dead 1 with just four new characters and new maps and all the same enemies as before and all that, then I am right there with you. I will sign the goddamn petition myself.
6204280	6215280	But I don't think we can really say until the game is out. And Valve, as a developer, does not seem like the type of company that would do that, but I don't know. It could be wishful thinking.
6215280	6225280	At the same time, like I mentioned before, don't you guys think you might be a little bit spoiled by them? I mean, I think their support of the community and everything has been huge.
6225280	6235280	I mean, look at what they're doing with Team Fortress 2. It's just like updates upon updates for this game that came out, you know, a while ago and still, you know, huge support for it.
6235280	6248280	And I think at the same time, you don't realize that, you know, yeah, they're putting a lot of support behind this, but at the same time, they need to make some money too. And yeah, that's not an excuse, I guess, in the gamer's eyes to put out another game.
6248280	6256280	But at the same time, maybe there's something that really they can't do where they felt, okay, this is different enough that it justifies its own release.
6256280	6269280	I don't know. I mean, you can't just have everything be exactly the same all the time. Things have to change, so I guess, you know, if you don't like it, don't buy it.
6269280	6278280	And then, you know what, if the sales suck on it, then they'll learn, okay, maybe we can't do this. If that's really, you know, a money grab.
6278280	6288280	Yeah, we have some comments on chat and, you know, again, it seems to be that most people are saying, Act F says, bah, cry more. That's my opinion on the Left 4 Dead 2 boycott.
6288280	6294280	GameGuru says, I'm willing to give Left 4 Dead 2 the benefit of the doubt because it means Left 4 Dead 1 will be cheaper.
6294280	6307280	There you go. I don't know, I guess we'll see a little more when this game actually is released. I think that's when I have to reserve my ultimate judgment for is when the game's released.
6307280	6317280	If it stinks then, then I'll be right there in line with you guys and if they try to push out Left 4 Dead 3 in 2010, if Left 4 Dead 2 stinks, I will openly mock it here on this program.
6317280	6324280	I mean, and just, you know, I wouldn't exactly blame Microsoft for, I mean, look at the company that's, you know, helping to publish these games.
6324280	6332280	They're known for putting out numerous sports games each year numerically. I mean, come on.
6332280	6342280	I want to read this email real quick and this comes to us from our old buddy Rini. I'm not going to read the whole thing because it's very, very lengthy, but I do want to read bits and pieces of it and give this game a little shout out here.
6342280	6349280	Greetings, OLR peoples. Rini here and I just got into the free limited beta for Ion online that happened for the weekend of June 7th.
6349280	6356280	I'm trying the game out because Warcraft has become the doldrums and also because it's become my best friend's next fangasm until Final Fantasy XIV.
6356280	6361280	For the bulk of this lengthy email, I'm going to describe some features from the game that I've witnessed in comparison to WoW.
6361280	6368280	It talks about the plot being two rival races. It talks about that it's got the character customization of Elder Scrolls Oblivion.
6368280	6374280	There's a mage, priest, scouts, and warriors. At level 9, a quest is automatically given to you to get your wings.
6374280	6378280	It's basically a free ride to level 10 that you should get to all the different capital cities.
6378280	6386280	The flight time is initially limited, but you can extend it. There's loading time when you start the game, but once you get in there, it's very short, around 10 seconds or so.
6386280	6391280	The game is very pretty in a Final Fantasy sort of way. The battles are brisk and so forth.
6391280	6397280	I'm trying to read through all this. It talks about missions and holding things in a cube and what have you.
6397280	6404280	Something WoW neglects. If you're in a high traffic area and it's really bogging your system down, it's no problem.
6404280	6409280	Press a keyboard combination and all other player models will disappear.
6409280	6416280	I didn't get to try out stuff like parties, alliances, emotes, etc. There's a lot of interface elements that would need a plugin for WoW to show up.
6416280	6422280	For example, a quest tracker or a level gauge for quests. For some reason, there's a quest to steal a bathing nymph's clothes too.
6422280	6427280	I've taken screenshots of what I've seen around the game, with the game running almost everything at max settings.
6427280	6433280	No anti-aliasing, decree, shadow, and water effects. Please skim through it and post to chat if you would like.
6433280	6439280	Hopefully Ion will not disappoint. I'm buying the limited edition and getting suckered into playing it anyway because I want to play with my best friend.
6439280	6444280	My expectations are low because WoW's PVP just left me insulted with how slow and unfair it was.
6444280	6448280	Maybe Ion will be a little closer to something resembling PSO.
6448280	6454280	Lastly, I'd like to apologize, especially to Sky, for bringing up hopes for Omega Man Legends 3 for E3. Sorry!
6454280	6459280	This email is brought to you by Benafiber. Everyone needs their damn fiber. Fuck yeah, bowel movements.
6459280	6466280	I have a question, and this is kind of E3 related, but the whole Mega Man Legends thing.
6466280	6470280	I remember Capcom said they had two secret games that they hadn't announced yet.
6470280	6476280	One of those got leaked, and that was Tatsunoko vs Capcom All-Stars or whatever it was.
6476280	6477280	What the hell was the second one?
6477280	6480280	Well, hold on, because we've got a call, and I bet this caller might know.
6480280	6482280	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this?
6482280	6483280	Hey, what's up guys? It's the Rob D.
6483280	6487280	Rob, we had you on hold while Loki was saying that. Do you know what that second game is?
6487280	6491280	I think it was a Resident Evil title for the PSP. I think that's what it was.
6491280	6496280	I remember hearing that being announced, and I asked a couple people about it, and I think that's what it was.
6496280	6501280	That makes sense. Well, Rob, we have the Skyplines open all night tonight, so I know you're calling in to respond to something in the mailbag.
6501280	6506280	In fact, you said on chat something about this whole Left 4 Dead 2 boycott. What are your thoughts on it?
6506280	6509280	Well, here's the thing. I've seen a lot of different complaints.
6509280	6515280	Obviously, people love to complain about everything on forums and on podcasts and everything when it relates to the video game industry,
6515280	6517280	because people are passionate about it. It's their interest.
6517280	6524280	And I've seen people defend a lot of stupid things. I've seen people defend us getting nickeled and dimed for horse armor.
6524280	6529280	And you know what? That even brings up a lot of strong opinions even today.
6529280	6535280	But this is the first time that I've ever seen people do something, gamers in particular, that I just cannot defend at all.
6535280	6542280	Because, I mean, really, remember when we got expansion packs back in the late 90s and people got pissed off at that
6542280	6549280	because it was just a couple new enemies, more levels, and they weren't even really that good for games like Sin and whatever else.
6549280	6553280	We flipped upside down. Now we don't want sequels.
6553280	6559280	We don't want these companies to actually give us new engines and give us new sets of things to do.
6559280	6562280	We want expansion packs. What has changed now?
6562280	6567280	I would give one of my good kidneys to get a sequel, certainly before this year, for Street Fighter,
6567280	6571280	and now for a true sequel to Chrono Trigger or Marvel vs. Capcom 3.
6571280	6577280	Why are people upset that they're getting a sequel to a game they love? I don't get this.
6577280	6582280	Well, I think they feel that this sequel is an expansion pack. That's what it is.
6582280	6585280	No, they want it as an expansion pack with DLC. They don't want an actual sequel.
6585280	6588280	They don't want Valve to actually put the effort in.
6588280	6597280	I understand they want more support for Left 4 Dead, but why don't they want an actual game with new features and hopefully a better game?
6597280	6599280	Progress is good.
6599280	6604280	Well, I think the argument, and again, I don't really know the other side as well.
6604280	6610280	Maybe we'll get emails on it next week, but I think the argument is they feel like, because this is being put together so quickly,
6610280	6616280	because the early screenshots and gameplay indicate it's basically Left 4 Dead 1 with new characters enduring the day and a new setting,
6616280	6623280	that this is basically a guitar hero Van Halen of Left 4 Dead.
6623280	6627280	But we're making our judgments on a handful of trailers and a few screenshots.
6627280	6631280	And you hinted at this earlier, that this is Valve. This is not a company.
6631280	6636280	Admittedly, I think it is published by EA, right? Or maybe you're talking about Rockband.
6636280	6639280	No, this is published by EA.
6639280	6645280	Yeah. I understand that since it is published by EA, that is some cause for concern.
6645280	6650280	But you know what? This isn't a company that has done this in the past that is developing this game.
6650280	6653280	We should give them a little bit of trust.
6653280	6658280	Deep Man and Chat says they think it will break up the community, it will split them between the two games.
6658280	6661280	I don't know if I necessarily see that so much.
6661280	6665280	About Call of Duty, we'll look at Call of Duty World at War and Call of Duty Modern Warfare.
6665280	6668280	The games that that happens to are the sports games.
6668280	6674280	That's the one where you go into EA 2010, you know, whatever, and then 2009 is abandoned.
6674280	6680280	But most games you still find, you know, pretty, like case in point, EverQuest 1 and EverQuest 2.
6680280	6685280	Granted, completely different type of game because people invest a lot more time into those types of games.
6685280	6689280	But EverQuest 1 still has probably more of a community than EverQuest 2.
6691280	6694280	Any other thoughts, Rob? Before we let you go and wrap up part A here.
6694280	6700280	Not really. This whole issue just ticks me off so much because, again, there are so many games that I can think of.
6700280	6704280	I don't want to bash it, but there are so many games that I enjoy more that I would want sequels to.
6704280	6708280	And these people are complaining because they are getting a sequel to it and good timing too.
6708280	6710280	Well, let's just hope that the sequel is not cheap.
6710280	6715280	Let's hope that what you and I are thinking is the case and that this game will be pretty awesome with a lot of new features.
6715280	6718280	Or else, I don't know, they may have a point.
6718280	6721280	I think they'll eat crow. But anyway, see you guys later.
6721280	6722280	Alright, take care, Rob.
6722280	6727280	Yeah, I don't know. I think, I don't know. I don't know. I can't tell until I play the game.
6727280	6728280	That's really where it's at.
6728280	6730280	Alright, dang, we are really long.
6730280	6732280	And sorry I didn't get to all the emails tonight.
6732280	6735280	I didn't get the emails from some folks that actually called us anyway or some folks put,
6735280	6738280	you don't have to read this on air, so I didn't because we had a lot of emails tonight.
6738280	6741280	But if you want to send us an email for a future week, please do.
6741280	6743280	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
6743280	6745280	We are going to finally take a break here.
6745280	6748280	You know we've been on air for an hour and fifty minutes so far.
6748280	6749280	We're going to take a break.
6749280	6752280	Dark Soccer is on her way home, so it sounds like she'll be joining us for Part B tonight.
6752280	6757280	We'll be right back in about five to ten minutes with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
6757280	6760280	For those of you guys listening on the podcast, though, you only have to wait like five seconds.
6760280	6761280	Aren't you lucky?
6761280	6769280	We'll be right back with plenty more stories here on Orange Lounge Radio.
6769280	6774280	Welcome back, everybody, to Part B of tonight's episode, number 327,
6774280	6778280	taping live on AllGames.com on this lovely Sunday night.
6778280	6784280	We are here, Orange Lounge Radio, myself, Loki, and making her way back into the studio.
6784280	6787280	Dark Soccer is here joining us for Part B tonight.
6787280	6791280	Hi, I'm just, I will be officially joining probably in about another ten, fifteen minutes.
6791280	6793280	You had a PE class or something tonight, right?
6793280	6799280	Yeah, I did. I'm taking, well, it's walking slash jogging slash running slash cardio slash whatever
6799280	6801280	we want to do as long as it gets the heart rate up for twenty minutes.
6801280	6802280	That's the class.
6802280	6805280	And it's mostly online, so it's on our system, you know, pretty much.
6805280	6813280	But the test our teacher has us do now and the fact that she watches us walk our mile,
6813280	6818280	I don't think, unless someone really can fake it well, I don't think anyone's going to be able to, so.
6818280	6819280	Interesting.
6819280	6823280	Yeah, and apparently this is her third one and she's had a lot of success with it, so I'm pretty happy.
6823280	6826280	All right, well, that's all right. Loki and I are going to continue to juggle the stories,
6826280	6830280	but please chime in as I know I told you before the show about something new,
6830280	6832280	the new experiment we were trying tonight.
6832280	6836280	We almost went two hours with Part A, six stories, but lots of opinions out there.
6836280	6841280	Well, you know, I actually, I kind of, I was thinking about it actually when I was doing my very painful
6841280	6843280	because of my shoes walk.
6843280	6847280	No, I got new walking shoes and I need insoles for them because it makes my arch hurt.
6847280	6853280	But anyway, enough fitness talk, which I actually want to get back into playing DDR
6853280	6857280	because I walked a thirteen minute mile when I was playing DDR once a week.
6857280	6858280	I'm on DDR.
6858280	6862280	I went to Roseville Golf Land this week, the place where video games go to die.
6862280	6865280	I played that lovely, lovely BeatMania 2DX distorted machine they had.
6865280	6867280	Player one black keys are sticking already.
6867280	6868280	Gotta love it.
6868280	6870280	Right side pride.
6870280	6871280	Whatever.
6871280	6873280	Haha, I don't have to deal with that.
6873280	6874280	Die in a right side fire.
6874280	6875280	Burn.
6875280	6880280	Well, now that I'm not upstairs anymore in my apartment, my DDR hard pads,
6880280	6884280	as soon as I figure out how to ground them from the static electricity buildup.
6884280	6889280	Let's not revive the DDR discussion from last week because I'll just get really sad.
6889280	6891280	The whole thing.
6891280	6893280	My pads actually started falling apart.
6893280	6895280	Now you're going to have to mod them for eight arrows.
6895280	6896280	Remember, that's what we're getting in the PlayStation.
6896280	6898280	No, I'm sorry, that's not real DDR.
6898280	6900280	Don't buy this Konami bullshit.
6900280	6901280	No, we can't think of anything.
6901280	6902280	Let's add more arrows.
6902280	6903280	I'm more curious.
6903280	6904280	Wait, hold on about DDR.
6904280	6906280	I'm more curious what Jamie was thinking on her walk
6906280	6908280	because it was about the show and the whole thing.
6908280	6911280	Well, no, I was just thinking about what it was going to be like,
6911280	6916280	and it actually was going to be more like when Larry King has people call in,
6916280	6918280	except we're cooler and he's old.
6918280	6922280	Well, you know, and I think a lot of the feedback I've kind of heard
6922280	6924280	over the couple years we've been doing this, you know,
6924280	6926280	because it seems like every year or two years we try something new with the format.
6926280	6930280	So we've been doing, what, this whole combined A and B for about, what, a year and a half or so?
6930280	6934280	I think one of the feedback I get is, you know, we already kind of hear about the news.
6934280	6937280	I tune in to hear you guys, you know, talk about it, make jokes and so forth,
6937280	6942280	and the fact that, you know, not a lot of shows are as interactive as you guys.
6942280	6945280	I mean, granted, there's lots of shows that are trying to get interactive, you know,
6945280	6947280	but they're kind of few and far between.
6947280	6949280	We started off that way, really.
6949280	6951280	Yeah, I mean, well, that's always what our show's been about.
6951280	6953280	We either had the studio full of people or...
6953280	6957280	But instead of just running through the news and then let everybody call in on this,
6957280	6960280	you know, hodgepock clusterfuck of calls at the end, why not, you know,
6960280	6962280	since this is the show where every gamer has a voice,
6962280	6965280	spend a little more time on each story and let everybody voice their opinions.
6965280	6968280	Giving that same, that, you know, aforementioned voice.
6968280	6971280	Yes, and tell the dick and fart joke that goes along with that story.
6971280	6972280	Hey, Rob.
6972280	6973280	What?
6973280	6974280	A dick went fart.
6974280	6975280	Ha ha.
6975280	6977280	I'm laughing.
6977280	6978280	Okay.
6978280	6982280	I am going to go freshen up.
6982280	6983280	All right.
6983280	6984280	Let's see.
6984280	6985280	Let's move.
6985280	6986280	All right.
6986280	6988280	Let's get back into some of that gaming news that we're going to spend a little more time on tonight.
6988280	6991280	Of course, you can call us at any time, 1-877-GAME-OLR.
6991280	6993280	If we don't get to the story you wanted to talk about tonight, though,
6993280	6996280	we will open up the Skype line at the end of the show for open bar.
6996280	7001280	Loki, you're going to start us off this half with another story.
7001280	7002280	Yes, I am.
7002280	7010280	So apparently the PS3 motion controller that they showed off at, you know, E3.
7010280	7012280	You know what, that always happens.
7012280	7013280	Play happy music.
7013280	7014280	Damn it.
7014280	7015280	Sorry.
7015280	7018280	Maybe someday I'll learn how to fix my audio cues.
7018280	7019280	Sorry.
7019280	7020280	Yes, PlayStation 3.
7020280	7021280	Yes.
7021280	7026280	So the new motion controller that they showed off during their E3 press conference,
7026280	7031280	it's apparently going to be compatible with existing games,
7031280	7037280	which it makes sense because you can patch games and why not?
7037280	7045280	I'm not sure if it's exactly going to work the way, say, you think, I don't know,
7045280	7047280	a controller, like it wouldn't be mapped.
7047280	7053280	Like if, you know, I move my arm down, it's not going to move the analog stick left down or something like that.
7053280	7055280	You know, I don't think it's going to be like that.
7055280	7058280	But they may be able to patch it in to other games,
7058280	7061280	which makes sense because they patched in DualShock 3 support.
7061280	7062280	Why not?
7062280	7064280	And you know what, I support that.
7064280	7066280	I mean, that would be kind of cool.
7066280	7072280	You know, some of your older games get new life later on with this controller if you happen to buy it.
7072280	7075280	But here's my thing and the reason why I want to talk about this a little bit.
7075280	7079280	Do we really need motion control to be shoved down our throat in every game?
7079280	7082280	It doesn't have to be, but it's an option.
7082280	7088280	It's a good way, say, you put up the motion controller and there's like, say, five games that support it.
7088280	7092280	Now you can have like a bunch of games that support it, but it's still going to feel tacked on.
7092280	7095280	Maybe this is what I need to make me feel better about this.
7095280	7098280	Maybe callers want to input on this 1877 game OLR.
7098280	7104280	What game would be better if they went back and added motion control?
7104280	7111280	Lair, what Sony PlayStation 3 game is going to be better if they go back and add this whole, you know, Sony,
7111280	7114280	it doesn't have an official name, does it yet?
7114280	7116280	I think somebody said the PS3 mode.
7116280	7117280	Cosmic Ice Cream Cones.
7117280	7120280	Okay, the Cosmic Ice Cream Cones.
7120280	7124280	What old PlayStation 3 game is going to be better with the Cosmic Ice Cream Cones?
7124280	7125280	I don't know.
7125280	7130280	Seeing as most PlayStation 3 games are on the Xbox 360, we don't have that yet.
7130280	7136280	Here's my thought, maybe they come up with a control scheme for like a first person shooter,
7136280	7139280	and then boom, they can put those in the first person shooter games.
7139280	7141280	You know, something that works well.
7141280	7143280	But yeah, you're right, I don't know.
7143280	7149280	Don't you think this is only going to show up though in the actual Sony, you know,
7149280	7152280	first party in their own developer type of games?
7152280	7154280	Probably, yeah.
7154280	7156280	But I mean, I don't know.
7156280	7165280	This is all coming from, you know, I want to say it was Jack Trenton who, he says,
7165280	7169280	personally it's very difficult for me to perceive God of War 3 played with a Wii controller,
7169280	7173280	but it's a different experience that doesn't lend itself to certain types of games,
7173280	7179280	but I think our controller can be used with every game that's on the system now
7179280	7181280	and every game that we're working on.
7181280	7184280	So he could just be blowing smoke up someone's ass, you know.
7184280	7187280	My controller's awesome, it works with everything, it's super awesome,
7187280	7189280	everything that we touch turns to gold.
7189280	7193280	You know, that's basically his thought on it.
7193280	7196280	So really we could be reading way too much into this.
7196280	7199280	I think the games you're going to see that get this enhancement,
7199280	7205280	like Infamous, Killzone 3, all the first person shooters basically,
7205280	7209280	Uncharted and Resistance.
7209280	7213280	Those will be the games that will support this whole Cosmic Ice Cream codes.
7213280	7216280	Honestly, I don't think it's any of these games at all.
7216280	7221280	I think since this isn't going to come out for a while, it'll probably be...
7221280	7224280	I would be fine if they didn't even patch it backwards,
7224280	7226280	because it's just going to be tacking it on.
7226280	7230280	It's just, I don't know.
7230280	7235280	I mean, it's one-one control, so unless you have it really programmed in the game
7235280	7238280	to be really intricate, I don't think it's going to work,
7238280	7240280	because you're just going to be making a gesture,
7240280	7243280	and it's going to do an action, just like the Wii.
7243280	7246280	And I think a lot of it is resources for me.
7246280	7247280	That's why I kind of bring this up.
7247280	7249280	You know, I know there's a lot of people out there that would say,
7249280	7250280	well, what's the harm?
7250280	7253280	So they want to go back and add motion control in these games.
7253280	7254280	Is that such a bad thing?
7254280	7256280	It's added value, it's something extra.
7256280	7261280	But I'm saying, well, resources that could be used to instead make new games better.
7261280	7264280	Why go back and patch the game with motion controls
7264280	7267280	when you can make the sequel have motion controls?
7267280	7270280	Then again, I'm also clamoring for some of my old Xbox games
7270280	7273280	to still be playable with backwards emulation on Xbox 360,
7273280	7275280	which will never happen at this point.
7275280	7276280	They're done with that. You know they are.
7276280	7278280	They are done.
7278280	7280280	Because they want to do the downloads, the digital downloads.
7280280	7282280	They're done with classic Xbox at this point.
7282280	7283280	The classic Xbox.
7283280	7285280	The Xbox 360 digital downloads is where it's at now.
7285280	7286280	There's still going to be Xbox originals,
7286280	7289280	but it's not going to be anything that wasn't already supported
7289280	7290280	with the backwards compatibility.
7290280	7294280	There's not going to be any more updates for backwards compatibility,
7294280	7297280	unless there really is a team still working on it,
7297280	7298280	which I don't think there is.
7298280	7300280	I don't think there is either.
7300280	7303280	Let's move on and talk about something else with Sony.
7303280	7308280	It has to do kind of from the same sort of original source
7308280	7311280	that the whole PlayStation 3 motion control can do with.
7311280	7319280	I want to talk about the actual president of PlayStation, Jack Trenton, and leaks.
7319280	7321280	And a big quote he said.
7321280	7324280	It was interesting because at the show,
7324280	7325280	when he's actually giving the press conference,
7325280	7328280	he joked and was very tongue-in-cheek about the leaks.
7328280	7331280	Thank you all for coming out considering everything leaked out.
7331280	7335280	He showed his anger a little more this week in an interview
7335280	7338280	on a story that was on CSNBC.com this week.
7338280	7341280	People don't respect confidentiality in this industry,
7341280	7343280	Jack Trenton was quoted as saying.
7343280	7346280	It's tough enough to keep a secret within your own company,
7346280	7350280	much less when you speak to third parties.
7350280	7352280	And they're talking about that right for right now.
7352280	7355280	The CNBC article continues on.
7355280	7357280	At E3, it was certainly annoying,
7357280	7360280	but as we start to get into whatever's next for gaming,
7360280	7362280	this type of stuff can really hurt.
7362280	7365280	Is that you want to keep features of your machines quiet
7365280	7368280	so that your competition doesn't figure out about them,
7368280	7370280	but I don't know at the same time.
7370280	7374280	A lot of people that work in the game industry stay in the game industry,
7374280	7376280	so I would think there's talk amongst people.
7376280	7379280	Yes, they all sign NDAs, but I don't think they hold up.
7379280	7380280	Sniff out your moles.
7380280	7384280	If it's really a big issue for you and you really want to crack down on them,
7384280	7387280	start releasing false information,
7387280	7389280	and then the people that report on it,
7389280	7391280	then you release a different one to each person,
7391280	7394280	and the people that report on that, then you know where it came from.
7394280	7397280	And then Trenton continues on with this quote.
7397280	7400280	This is an industry that has trouble focusing on today.
7400280	7403280	We want to constantly talk about tomorrow.
7403280	7405280	You have to prepare for people to know things in advance.
7405280	7408280	The frustrating thing is they only know a part of the story
7408280	7411280	and that opens up a lot of conjecture and misinformation
7411280	7416280	that ultimately waters down the reality when you roll it out.
7416280	7417280	Really?
7417280	7420280	I'm tired of all these podcasters that go on air
7420280	7423280	and talk about all the different ways they interpret a patent.
7423280	7425280	No, he didn't really say that, but that's the way he's really saying it.
7425280	7429280	Really didn't water it down because the PSP Go,
7429280	7432280	which has been rumored to be coming out for a while now,
7432280	7438280	and then leaked by them, I mean by Sony through Core,
7438280	7442280	which really, can you complain about leaks and stuff
7442280	7446280	when your own magazine seems to put out the information
7446280	7448280	before your present conference?
7448280	7450280	Really didn't water it down at all.
7450280	7452280	In fact, I don't think it did.
7452280	7454280	If anything, it got people's hopes up,
7454280	7457280	and then we saw what they announced the features for it,
7457280	7460280	and we're like, eh, that sounds stupid.
7460280	7463280	It's like, oh, you didn't add a second analog stick?
7463280	7468280	Oh, you didn't make it so that, I don't know,
7468280	7470280	it does other things other than normal PlayStation?
7470280	7475280	Oh, it's not going to be cheaper than the PSP 3000 or something like that?
7475280	7477280	It's going to be more expensive? Awesome!
7477280	7480280	And most people doing these speculating and rumor mongering
7480280	7484280	and blogging on the internet gave the PSP Go the benefit of the doubt.
7484280	7487280	A lot of people, ourselves included, when we were on Bobby's show
7487280	7490280	and even on our own show talking about the PSP Go,
7490280	7493280	what a great entry-level PSP system this is going to be.
7493280	7496280	It's going to be a great, cheap device that people are going to use
7496280	7497280	and they can get rid of the disks.
7497280	7499280	It's going to be cheap, it's going to be easy to use.
7499280	7505280	And then, what was the real surprise that we all got slapped with at E3?
7505280	7508280	No, I'd like to go on the record saying that I never thought it was a good idea,
7508280	7513280	but I did think that the whole not having the UMD drive in there
7513280	7517280	was a stupid idea and I couldn't believe that they were that stupid to do that.
7517280	7519280	And sure enough, they were that stupid.
7519280	7521280	Look, I don't think that's a stupid idea.
7521280	7525280	I think it's a fine idea and this whole PSP Go is a fine system,
7525280	7527280	but not for $250.
7527280	7529280	That price point ruined the whole thing.
7529280	7531280	And that was the only surprise that they kept under wraps.
7531280	7534280	That's sort of like deja vu if you think about it.
7534280	7536280	The price point ruined the whole thing.
7536280	7541280	$600 PS3. The price point ruined the whole thing.
7541280	7545280	Oh, but it has Blu-Ray and it's $600.
7545280	7550280	So whoever is determining what the prices should be at Sony needs to wake the fuck up, basically, is what it is.
7550280	7555280	And stop eating crayons, Jamie is yelling from the kitchen.
7555280	7561280	Isn't the door supposed to be shut while recording is in progress? No, I'm kidding.
7561280	7565280	Alright, if you want to comment on this, 1877 Game OLR,
7565280	7573280	looking at some comments in chat, Game Guru says cheap is the term that Sony needs to learn.
7573280	7577280	D5T says moving to flash-based media is the future.
7577280	7579280	Movable parts are old.
7579280	7581280	See, I'm almost with him here.
7581280	7586280	I mean, you can't say Sony, screw you, for losing UMD when you're also watching on the same token.
7586280	7591280	Microsoft's now getting into digital distribution with the whole classic Xbox 360 games,
7591280	7595280	or I'm sorry, new Xbox 360 games available for download on the site.
7595280	7602280	We were talking in the first half of the show tonight about Xbox possibly launching a cheaper console next year
7602280	7604280	that's going to be targeted at the family audience.
7604280	7609280	Who's to say that if they do that, this system is going to lose the disk drive completely
7609280	7615280	and could possibly be an online-only download thing using the hand-wavy Natal device to make you choose your games?
7615280	7618280	It won't work because people like buying stuff.
7618280	7620280	They like having the physical disk in their hand.
7620280	7625280	And yeah, I know people that have the iPhone stuff go crazy over the App Store because there's everything in there.
7625280	7627280	But you know what?
7627280	7631280	It's just, if you could go, if it took like disks or something like that,
7631280	7634280	I'm sure people would probably want to buy this because you know what?
7634280	7635280	You know what you can do with disks?
7635280	7638280	You can return them when they don't work.
7638280	7640280	You can return them when you don't like them.
7640280	7643280	You can return them when you're done with them.
7643280	7644280	You can resell them.
7644280	7647280	Digital download, you bought it, you're stuck with it.
7647280	7649280	If it sucks, too bad. You bought it.
7649280	7656280	Dekeman in our chatroom, chat.orangelandtraded.com, says the reason they gave for the price was to compete with the iPhone.
7656280	7658280	If Apple can do it, then so can we.
7658280	7659280	And the funny thing was they dropped them.
7659280	7663280	Basically, they think they can get away with it since people pay for it.
7663280	7667280	Apple's tech, they'll pay it for ours.
7667280	7669280	Oh, well, whoops.
7669280	7673280	It was just announced this week that the iPhone's coming down to $99.
7673280	7677280	Now it's going to cost $99 for somebody to get an iPhone.
7677280	7680280	Granted, yeah, they're going to have to sign away their life on the two-year contract.
7680280	7681280	But guess what?
7681280	7683280	Most people don't think about that.
7683280	7690280	They just think, ooh, shiny, $99 iPhone, and hey, I'll sign this two-year contract because that's how long I expect this to last anyway.
7690280	7695280	And seriously, if Sony didn't see that one coming, they are mentally deficient.
7695280	7699280	And whoever did not see that one coming at Sony needs to be fired.
7699280	7702280	They have no business working in business.
7702280	7711280	A moron walking off the street, my mother, who doesn't even know how to put a CD in a computer, could tell you.
7711280	7718280	Apple, I love my mom, but she's technically stupid, and I can say that in the nicest possible way.
7718280	7728280	Even my mother knows every June Apple gets up there, parades out Steve Jobs.
7728280	7731280	They couldn't do that this year, obviously, with their one more thing.
7731280	7738280	Everybody knows Apple upgrades their shit every year and gets people to buy it all over again.
7738280	7739280	It works for Apple.
7739280	7742280	It is not going to work for Sony at those prices.
7742280	7748280	Sony is not Apple, and the other thing, too, is they have a huge following with Apple.
7748280	7751280	Sony doesn't quite have that following with the PSP.
7751280	7760280	And to be honest, and I really, really hate to say this, there's more features in the iPhone than there are right now in the PSP.
7760280	7762280	I mean, it's got a touch screen on it.
7762280	7766280	Hell, if they added a touch screen to the PSP, that might be a whole different story.
7766280	7769280	Hey, that might be worth picking up, because that's completely different.
7769280	7777280	It's going to open up a whole different set of possibilities if they had support with, like, I know it has support now with Bluetooth or something like that.
7777280	7779280	Big whoop. Oh, goody.
7779280	7788280	And look, and to those that want to make the argument that, well, Apple releases their new toys at high-end prices.
7788280	7790280	You know, granted, I'll give you that.
7790280	7793280	Their laptops, I don't think I'm going to buy another Apple laptop.
7793280	7796280	They are too expensive for what you get.
7796280	7798280	For someone like me.
7798280	7801280	Your mic's not on, dear.
7801280	7803280	Oh, shit.
7803280	7817280	I went to talking with some other people in the art industry, you know, and a couple people were actually saying that they were noticing that there's not as much need for people to have a Mac these days.
7817280	7825280	In the industry, now that the PCs are catching up and, you know, different programs are saying, hey, people actually use PCs, you know.
7825280	7829280	So even that edge is starting to blur a little bit.
7829280	7833280	I think Apple's in for a rude awakening in the laptop market within the next couple years.
7833280	7835280	But they've got it on the iPhone.
7835280	7838280	I mean, you know, Apple right now is a phone company.
7838280	7840280	That is what Apple is doing best.
7840280	7842280	They are a phone and music company.
7842280	7845280	They don't really, well, God, I'm going to get so much hate mail for this.
7845280	7854280	But look, as somebody who's going out there wanting to get a new laptop and so forth, I cannot look at these two things.
7854280	7857280	Like you look at a Mac laptop over here and then a PC that does all the same stuff.
7857280	7859280	I can't continue to do that anymore.
7859280	7862280	However, Apple has it nailed on the iPhone.
7862280	7866280	$199 for their newest model, the 3GS.
7866280	7869280	Granted, yes, you're signing these contracts, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
7869280	7870280	People are probably going to do it anyway.
7870280	7875280	But look, you have the $199 iPhone, the $249 PSP Go.
7875280	7877280	I can watch movies on both.
7877280	7878280	Check.
7878280	7879280	I can get on the internet with both.
7879280	7880280	Check.
7880280	7881280	I can play music on both.
7881280	7882280	Check.
7882280	7885280	I can play games on both that I download online.
7885280	7886280	Check.
7886280	7891280	The only thing the Sony PSP has got is that the games are of a higher caliber than the ones you see on the iPhone.
7891280	7892280	I will give it that.
7892280	7904280	Right now, and supposedly the 3GS has better specs or something than the 3G, so maybe they will be a little bit better later on.
7904280	7911280	And it also doesn't have actual control pads, so that does kind of limit them as far as games go.
7911280	7919280	Rama in chat says, Rob Roberts, everything you have done on your MacBook can be done on a $500 PC laptop flawlessly.
7919280	7921280	That's what I'm starting to find out, too.
7921280	7925280	And part of what I loved about Macs is that they were so easy, you know, so great.
7925280	7926280	But here's the nice thing.
7926280	7932280	Finally, someone at Microsoft kind of wised up, oh my gosh, Apple's starting to bite into us a little bit here with this whole...
7932280	7934280	I think they're making it easier.
7934280	7935280	I don't know.
7935280	7937280	I'm going to open up this whole can of worms on the computer debate.
7937280	7938280	That's not what I want to do.
7938280	7946280	I want to talk about the PSP Go and all this stuff, you know, and the whole fact that it's $249 is way too much to be charging for that.
7946280	7948280	Actually, that wasn't even really originally what I wanted to talk about.
7948280	7953280	It was supposed to be about keeping secrets in the industry and people not respecting confidentiality in the industry.
7953280	7964280	Is that, you know, there's this fine line here where people want to know everything.
7964280	7965280	You know what I mean?
7965280	7971280	And there's such a real dog-eat-dog thing in the media and these blogs right now.
7971280	7973280	Every blog wants to be first.
7973280	7975280	Every blog wants to have the exclusive.
7975280	7982280	Blogs get pissed off when other blogs steal their stories that were an exclusive and so on and all of this.
7982280	7987280	How much is too much in regards to confidentiality?
7987280	7989280	I mean, the demand is out there.
7989280	7990280	People want to know.
7990280	7994280	The millisecond these things are thought of, Sony is even thinking about doing this.
7994280	7996280	People want to know about it.
7996280	7999280	How far is too far with this whole confidentiality?
7999280	8000280	Did this go too far?
8000280	8005280	Did the PSP go getting announced early and a lot of these other things, was that too far?
8005280	8007280	I don't know.
8007280	8008280	I don't have an easy answer for this.
8008280	8009280	Then don't tell these people.
8009280	8012280	If you want to keep a secret, you don't say anything.
8012280	8016280	You don't keep a secret by saying, go and tell 100 people.
8016280	8017280	Oh, by the way, don't tell anybody this.
8017280	8021280	But don't you have to tell your developers that they're going to be making the games?
8021280	8025280	Well, obviously someone else is blogging about it and leaking this stuff out.
8025280	8030280	You have people that are leaking out stuff all the time and they can hide behind the Internet.
8030280	8031280	They can be whomever.
8031280	8036280	They can be some industry mole and go on the record and stuff.
8036280	8044280	And they probably get some sort of joy out of having the exclusive story that no one knows about.
8044280	8047280	I mean, we've kind of also seen the other side of that too.
8047280	8051280	We once blew somebody's exclusive and they threatened to cut us off at the balls.
8051280	8054280	And it was kind of one of these things where it's like, well, wait a minute.
8054280	8057280	How come all these other people can get away with it?
8057280	8065280	And we've also seen it in the past too with NDAs where other people are given preferential treatment
8065280	8070280	because they're a big website and they're going to run an exclusive story.
8070280	8073280	Oh, let's decide which website gets to run the exclusive story.
8073280	8078280	And that's the shit that needs to stop right now because that's just encouraging people to one-up others.
8078280	8080280	I'm sorry. No pun intended.
8080280	8085280	Anyhow, let's move on.
8085280	8089280	See, now they're getting into the PC Mac debate and chat and I'm so sorry I opened that can of worms.
8089280	8091280	Look, buy what you like, like what you like.
8091280	8093280	Just have fun with it.
8093280	8097280	It's your money.
8097280	8099280	Buy whatever you want.
8099280	8105280	All I'm saying is that from my perspective right now as an average laptop user who wants to use Internet and all this stuff,
8105280	8108280	I've bought the MacBook before and it broke.
8108280	8110280	I thought Macs were never supposed to break.
8110280	8113280	They were supposed to be infallible machines that never get viruses and so forth.
8113280	8116280	And now I'm sitting here and I've really had to reevaluate this whole thing.
8116280	8119280	Is it worth it for me to spend that much on a computer again?
8119280	8121280	And for the things I want to do, I don't think it is.
8121280	8125280	Not until the apples come way down in price to be competitive with the PCs.
8125280	8127280	That's what I'm saying.
8127280	8131280	And removing features to cut costs is not an answer, Apple.
8131280	8134280	So, anyhow, sorry.
8134280	8136280	I apologize for getting completely off track.
8136280	8138280	Let's get back to video games.
8138280	8140280	Oh, what a video game on the next story, correct?
8140280	8151280	Yes. Of course, this is a classic and a remade game now coming to Xbox Live Arcade as an exclusive for a limited time.
8151280	8157280	That would be, of course, the brand new, or I guess, brand new remake.
8157280	8162280	Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Turtles in Time re-shelled, which looks pretty awesome, actually.
8162280	8170280	Completely redone 3D and, of course, will be available on Xbox Live Arcade July 22nd.
8170280	8177280	But, as for the PlayStation Network, later this year.
8177280	8184280	Well, I guess that's pretty cool that the games got dated and so forth, but how about the whole exclusive window thing?
8184280	8186280	I mean, is this another blow to Sony?
8186280	8196280	Is this simply a limit of, I don't know, are they saying that they actually have bought the timed exclusive window to this?
8196280	8197280	No.
8197280	8200280	Or is there some underlying technical problem that's causing this to be delayed on Sony?
8200280	8201280	I don't think there's a technical problem at all.
8201280	8209280	I think it's a deal, because if you think about it, this is actually part of the Summer of Live, or the Live Arcade Summer of Arcade, whatever the hell they're calling that.
8209280	8216280	So, they're gonna get an extra marketing push because of that, and probably the deal was that they gotta put it out later because of that.
8216280	8218280	What marketing push?
8218280	8224280	I mean, really, is being in the Summer of Arcade that much of a boost to sales?
8224280	8225280	It might be.
8225280	8226280	Really?
8226280	8229280	What do they do? What's the big deal about being in the Summer of Arcade?
8229280	8233280	The fact that they cluster a lot of highly anticipated games all together.
8233280	8239280	But for most Xbox Live Arcade games, I can think of anything I've anticipated, I knew where to seek it out and buy it.
8239280	8242280	Do they run extra ads in magazines?
8242280	8245280	They have a splash trailer thing or something, I don't know.
8245280	8248280	I guess. It just doesn't seem like that much of a boost.
8248280	8250280	Well, I'm just speculating, I don't know.
8250280	8254280	Maybe they had trouble developing on the PlayStation Network. I don't know what it is.
8254280	8257280	I don't think they would because Ubisoft would imagine.
8257280	8259280	Well, they're publishing it. Who knows who's developing it?
8259280	8263280	I mean, I don't know.
8263280	8267280	It could be something retarded. It probably is something retarded.
8267280	8270280	But you know what? Just get used to it.
8270280	8272280	I need to see more of this game in action.
8272280	8278280	So it's just pretty much a port of the old arcade game, but with those kind of cooler, upgraded graphics?
8278280	8279280	Yeah.
8279280	8281280	Huh. I guess that's kind of neat.
8281280	8286280	I know there's a lot of folks in our chat room that are anticipating the whole Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles game.
8286280	8291280	Of course, they're still arguing about PCs and Macs, so I don't really have a lot of comments to read.
8291280	8293280	Hey, I don't have to say anything anymore.
8293280	8295280	Hold on, let's see. Rama in chat says,
8295280	8299280	Super NES exclusive. Wasn't the Super Famicom version a direct port?
8299280	8301280	I don't know what game they're even talking about there.
8301280	8302280	Maybe Turtles.
8302280	8305280	Oh, it must be the same thing. Oh yeah, because Marin said earlier,
8305280	8308280	just play your Super Nintendo copy of the game like I will.
8308280	8313280	I guess, yeah, this whole timed exclusive thing does go back a little bit even to the days of Super Nintendo and Genesis.
8313280	8317280	Mortal Kombat was out on the Super Nintendo for a while before the Genesis, right? Am I right?
8317280	8322280	I know Street Fighter was, but then when it came out on the Genesis, they got, ooh, Championship Edition.
8322280	8326280	And that whole thing. Maybe they did come out at the same time. I think I was thinking of Street Fighter.
8326280	8329280	It was a long time ago.
8329280	8334280	And then Dark Tetsuya says, I forget, I just remember the Super Nintendo version having the extra levels and bosses.
8334280	8337280	Ooh, are we getting some of that in this? Extra levels and stuff?
8337280	8338280	There might be extra levels.
8338280	8343280	I mean, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles was a pretty huge Xbox Live game when it came out anyway.
8343280	8347280	Folks playing it online and having fun on Live with it, so I'm sure this is going to be no different.
8347280	8348280	I'm sure it'll be fun.
8348280	8349280	Yeah.
8349280	8350280	So, there you go.
8350280	8357280	Alright, well that game will be coming out July 22nd, I believe it was, so keep an eye out for that.
8357280	8360280	Moving on with more news, Metal Gear Solid Rising.
8360280	8366280	Of course, this was the whole moment at E3 where they came out at the Microsoft press conference.
8366280	8372280	The Xbox is getting Metal Gear Solid Rising.
8372280	8375280	And a lot of people were waiting for it, the whole Metal Gear Solid 4 thing.
8375280	8380280	Of course, now it should be noted, Metal Gear Solid Rising is not exclusive to the Xbox.
8380280	8383280	It's going on Xbox and PlayStation.
8383280	8386280	And a lot of folks are saying, well, it's going to still be.
8386280	8389280	It's like Metal Gear is continuing on or what have you.
8389280	8394280	But, apparently, it is a whole new engine for Metal Gear Solid Rising.
8394280	8401280	If you're thinking this is Metal Gear Solid 4 Plus or some game that was made in Metal Gear Solid 4's engine, uh-uh.
8401280	8409280	Sean Eyestone, who is an assistant producer at Kojima Productions, says the team is remaking Rising's engine from scratch.
8409280	8415280	Their goal, I should say, to make it look better than Metal Gear Solid 4.
8415280	8420280	And this is from a Kojima Productions podcast that came out this week.
8420280	8424280	Apparently, they are saying it is a big project like Metal Gear Solid 4.
8424280	8429280	The team is serious about making it look as good as possible on every platform.
8429280	8431280	That's kind of cool.
8431280	8433280	I mean, who cares? So what?
8433280	8437280	So Metal Gear Solid 4 came out and was exclusive to the Sony.
8437280	8439280	Good for them. How well is it selling now?
8439280	8442280	Still okay, but not what it used to be selling.
8442280	8447280	I don't think anyone is buying the system nowadays from Metal Gear Solid 4.
8447280	8456280	And now it's coming out on both systems, because I think they know that it would be a mistake to skip on the 360.
8456280	8461280	Because there is a lot of potential sales there, especially now that they didn't have Metal Gear Solid 4.
8461280	8464280	And so they're going to get a lot more money out of it.
8464280	8467280	And it's all about money nowadays, because times are tough.
8467280	8470280	So I'm not surprised.
8470280	8472280	And I am... I don't know.
8472280	8475280	It'd be weird if they kind of went in the opposite direction.
8475280	8479280	But it makes sense to them, just to put it out on both systems.
8479280	8482280	The Rob D. in chat, by the way, says,
8482280	8485280	So we're going from talking about a turtles game to talking about Solid Snakes.
8485280	8487280	What does this show become?
8487280	8489280	It has this reptile jungle tonight on Orange Lawns Radio, apparently.
8489280	8493280	Chat.orangelawnsradio.com if you want to make a smart ass comment like that one.
8493280	8500280	But, you know, I guess at first, when I first heard about this, I was like,
8500280	8504280	Oh, they're cranking this game out so fast because Metal Gear Solid 4,
8504280	8506280	they're just going to reuse that engine, and so forth.
8506280	8509280	But now, that doesn't seem to be the case.
8509280	8513280	So, you could look at this a couple of ways.
8513280	8514280	I get really excited when I hear,
8514280	8517280	Oh, they're going to make it look even better, and so forth.
8517280	8520280	But weren't they saying one of the reasons that they didn't port
8520280	8523280	Metal Gear Solid 4 to the Xbox 360?
8523280	8526280	And let's face it, folks, they never will at this point.
8526280	8527280	It is not happening.
8527280	8528280	This is what you're getting.
8528280	8530280	Be happy with this, Microsoft fans.
8530280	8533280	There is not Metal Gear Solid 4 coming into the Xbox 360.
8533280	8537280	If that was ever going to happen, it would have been announced before this.
8537280	8541280	So, that being said, is it possible,
8541280	8545280	they said that Metal Gear Solid 4 would not be ported to the Xbox 360
8545280	8548280	because it was made for Blu-ray.
8548280	8551280	The types of graphics that were on it and everything that was packed in that disk
8551280	8553280	was made for Blu-ray.
8553280	8556280	So that makes me think, OK, well then by that argument,
8556280	8560280	if they're scaling this back to fit every platform,
8560280	8563280	they're going to have to scale it back, not make it better.
8563280	8564280	Wrong.
8564280	8567280	And this goes back to what we were talking about earlier.
8567280	8570280	Metal Gear Solid 4 was going to max out the PS3,
8570280	8573280	but now they've learned that they can optimize their code.
8573280	8574280	There's different techniques.
8574280	8576280	And to be honest, their excuse was,
8576280	8579280	Oh, it's so big it can only fit on Blu-ray.
8579280	8583280	But at the same time, oh, and no one wants to swap disks, by the way,
8583280	8586280	which is retarded because there's a five-minute install
8586280	8589280	between sections of the game.
8589280	8590280	I mean, come on.
8590280	8592280	They could have easily swapped disks.
8592280	8594280	I'd rather spend two seconds to swap a disk
8594280	8598280	than to spend five minutes loading a section of the game to my hard drive.
8598280	8600280	And if I really wanted to do that with multiple disks,
8600280	8604280	I could do that now in the new Microsoft interface.
8604280	8606280	I can install each portion if I wanted to.
8606280	8608280	TigerKlonChat makes a really good point.
8608280	8611280	It says, also notice Metal Gear Solid Rising says,
8611280	8612280	Lightning Bolt action.
8612280	8614280	Maybe it's a new type of gameplay.
8614280	8618280	Given that Raiden is a ninja, it could very well be a hack and slash game.
8618280	8621280	Have we had anything confirmed that this is a stealth action game
8621280	8623280	like the other Metal Gear Solid games?
8623280	8625280	Or is TigerKlon to something here?
8625280	8627280	Because it's not Metal Gear Solid 5.
8627280	8630280	It's Metal Gear Solid Rising.
8630280	8633280	Maybe the type of game we're anticipating here should be,
8633280	8635280	maybe we need to set our expectations for something different.
8635280	8638280	Maybe we're looking at an action game, a beat-em-up.
8638280	8639280	I don't know about that.
8639280	8643280	Turtles in Time version of Metal Gear Solid.
8643280	8645280	I don't know about that far.
8645280	8647280	But that is interesting that it doesn't say anything
8647280	8650280	about the whole stealth, it's lightning bolt action.
8653280	8656280	Do you think that would be as successful if they change up the genre?
8659280	8661280	Maybe. Maybe not.
8661280	8663280	I guess it just depends on how good the game is.
8663280	8665280	I think people will bitch and moan, but they'll probably still buy it
8665280	8667280	because they're Metal Gear Solid fans.
8667280	8668280	Perhaps.
8668280	8669280	Alright, we'll see.
8669280	8671280	Let's continue on with some more news.
8671280	8675280	If you want to call us on this or any topic we're talking about,
8675280	8677280	give us a call at 1-877-GAME-OLR.
8677280	8678280	We haven't had a phone call in a little while.
8678280	8679280	Don't be shy.
8679280	8681280	Give us a call at 1-877-GAME-OLR.
8681280	8686280	Well, Xbox Live community games, they're getting a little bit of a facelift.
8686280	8690280	Starting in late July, Xbox Live community games
8690280	8696280	will now be changing to Xbox Live Indie games.
8696280	8700280	And apparently it's in response to community feedback
8700280	8705280	in order to increase understanding and promote the games.
8705280	8709280	So they're going to launch XNA Game Studio 3.1.
8709280	8718280	And apparently the game creators have, I guess they want to change
8718280	8720280	the appearance of the community games.
8720280	8723280	And indie games, it makes more sense.
8723280	8726280	Because community games, you kind of think of games made out of someone's garage.
8726280	8730280	Whereas indie games, you know, indie movies, sometimes they're gems
8730280	8733280	and they're just created with lower budget.
8733280	8736280	Maybe indie games will kind of give off that impression
8736280	8741280	that it's just going to be good games with lower budget.
8741280	8744280	I don't know about you, but I look at the XNA stuff
8744280	8746280	and there's a lot of it that sucks out there.
8746280	8748280	And there's a lot of stuff on there now.
8748280	8751280	I mean, a ton of things that you can play.
8751280	8753280	And a lot of them are really good.
8753280	8756280	But a lot of them are really, really bad.
8756280	8759280	What do you think about this whole rating system that's coming into the games?
8759280	8761280	Is this going to be a good thing or a bad thing?
8761280	8762280	I think it's a good thing.
8762280	8766280	It'll be able to separate the crap from the not-crap.
8766280	8769280	And I would love to see user-rated stuff.
8769280	8772280	So I can look at these games that people think are great.
8772280	8776280	Maybe have a way that you can see what your friends rate it or something like that.
8776280	8778280	So if I have similar tastes to, say, Rob,
8778280	8781280	I can play the games that he likes or something like that.
8781280	8782280	Now that's a good idea.
8782280	8786280	Maybe what I'm worried about with ratings is that in theory it sounds like a good idea.
8786280	8787280	But do you know what I'm worried about?
8787280	8789280	The dig effect.
8789280	8793280	You know how stories get bumped to the top of dig.com that you're like,
8793280	8794280	why the hell is this here?
8794280	8798280	And it's because so-and-so has millions of friends that will dig up the story for them.
8798280	8801280	And to be fair, we've had it happen to our stories before,
8801280	8803280	and I'm sure that's thanks to our OL Army.
8803280	8804280	So don't hear me wrong.
8804280	8807280	It's not necessarily a bad thing or whatever.
8807280	8812280	I would be worried in regards to this context of the whole indie games is that
8812280	8817280	what if a game maker whose game isn't really good
8817280	8820280	has 100 friends to go on there and rate it as great.
8820280	8825280	That's going to give it exposure it doesn't really deserve, I guess you could say.
8825280	8827280	And it's the same thing with iTunes reviews,
8827280	8830280	because I went off a couple weeks on the show.
8830280	8832280	A couple weeks ago on the show I was going off about,
8832280	8836280	I'm pissed off that somebody would actually take the time to write a negative review
8836280	8839280	about our show and post it with all the...
8839280	8845280	Granted, if somebody's saying things that have merit and real constructive criticism,
8845280	8846280	then I would shut up.
8846280	8849280	Then I would take the criticism and see what we can do with that.
8849280	8855280	But it sucks that somebody who might be a fan of some other show
8855280	8858280	who doesn't know how to support any podcasting,
8858280	8860280	who deserves to have karma bite him in the ass or something,
8860280	8863280	can have somebody go around and rate a bunch of other shows a 1
8863280	8866280	and no action gets taken against that user.
8866280	8870280	That user's opinion carries just as much weight
8870280	8872280	as somebody who actually thinks out their reviews.
8872280	8874280	Does that make any sense at all what I'm saying?
8874280	8875280	Yeah, it makes sense.
8875280	8878280	I would fear that just because somebody has a lot of friends,
8878280	8881280	their game gets all this extra exposure.
8881280	8884280	And you look at the top shows on iTunes,
8884280	8885280	again going back to iTunes, sorry,
8885280	8887280	but it's something I feel pretty passionate about.
8887280	8889280	You look at all the top shows on iTunes,
8889280	8894280	most of them are 1Ups, IGNs, Game Spots, G4s,
8894280	8897280	commercial, down your throat type fare.
8897280	8900280	And it kind of sucks for the rest of us
8900280	8903280	when podcasts were supposed to be an indie thing.
8903280	8906280	Until the mainstream jumped on board
8906280	8910280	because they saw it as a way to reach out to the community.
8910280	8913280	And now podcasts are everywhere.
8913280	8917280	And then at the same time, taking it a step further,
8917280	8920280	somebody who has the 100 friends that are willing to do
8920280	8924280	whatever they say or whatever, go and spam this game a 1
8924280	8927280	just because they don't like the person that made it
8927280	8928280	or what have you.
8928280	8931280	Or there's a competing game in the genre
8931280	8933280	that they don't want to have more exposure.
8933280	8937280	I could just see this ratings thing used for bad purposes.
8937280	8940280	And I hope there's a way, like you're saying, Loki,
8940280	8943280	to either see what my friends rated games
8943280	8946280	and only base my judgment off what my friends think of games
8946280	8948280	and maybe not the community as a whole,
8948280	8952280	or rate the raters would be a great thing.
8952280	8953280	Rate the raters.
8953280	8955280	That's something they need to bring to iTunes,
8955280	8956280	is rating the raters.
8956280	8958280	And you kind of can too a little bit.
8958280	8960280	You can say, was this comment helpful?
8960280	8961280	Yes or no.
8961280	8964280	But it really doesn't have any bearing on the author as a whole.
8964280	8966280	I think that's something I would like to see,
8966280	8968280	is you rate the rater.
8968280	8970280	And as the rater's rating goes up,
8970280	8972280	their rating carries more weight.
8972280	8974280	And as it goes down, it loses weight.
8974280	8976280	That's what I'd like to see.
8976280	8978280	That was a lot of uses of the word rate.
8978280	8980280	Only in the perfect world.
8980280	8981280	Yeah.
8981280	8982280	But I don't know.
8982280	8985280	I kind of think that's the way to do it.
8985280	8988280	But yeah, that one indie game you were talking about
8988280	8990280	earlier in the show, Attack, or what was it?
8990280	8991280	Barry Attack?
8991280	8992280	It was Angry Barry.
8992280	8993280	Angry Barry.
8993280	8995280	And you know where I saw that.
8995280	8997280	And I hate to say this, but IGN, actually,
8997280	9001280	they do a segment that's a community shower,
9001280	9002280	I think is what they call it.
9002280	9005280	And basically they cover, you know,
9005280	9007280	the last week of community games that came out,
9007280	9009280	and the ones that they like and the ones they don't like.
9009280	9011280	And that one had a video for it.
9011280	9014280	They actually shot a little video for Angry Barry, I think.
9014280	9015280	I don't know if they shot it,
9015280	9017280	or if they just got a trailer from the website
9017280	9019280	or something like that, but that's what it was from.
9019280	9022280	And then I went all exciting, you know, and downloaded it,
9022280	9024280	only to find out that it's broken.
9024280	9026280	So that sucked.
9026280	9028280	Marin in chat brings up a good point.
9028280	9030280	He says, but what if somebody doesn't agree with the rating person,
9030280	9033280	and so they rate the person lowly based on their opinion,
9033280	9034280	not their review rating?
9034280	9035280	That's a fair argument.
9035280	9037280	I mean, I guess it's...
9037280	9039280	The system, it's going to basically,
9039280	9040280	what it's going to come down to is,
9040280	9042280	yeah, there's going to be people that are going to do that,
9042280	9044280	and, you know, rally their friends,
9044280	9046280	but in the end it all equals out,
9046280	9049280	because there's a lot more people not involved with them
9049280	9051280	that, you know, aren't going to be rating and stuff.
9051280	9054280	So that it'll be just a slight fluctuation,
9054280	9056280	and that's really kind of,
9056280	9058280	you've got to account for that kind of error in there.
9058280	9060280	Well, I hope you're right,
9060280	9062280	and we can all hear you eating over there.
9062280	9064280	I just hit the mic with my plate.
9064280	9067280	Also, Kay Levster says,
9067280	9069280	I think it will sort itself out.
9069280	9072280	The Xbox Live community is far more liquid than Dig.
9072280	9073280	I don't know, though.
9073280	9075280	There's some real, like, come on.
9075280	9076280	You've played Halo Online.
9076280	9077280	I don't know if you have,
9077280	9079280	but a lot of you have played, like, Halo Online.
9079280	9082280	There are some people who play those games online.
9082280	9084280	I don't want to hear their opinions.
9084280	9086280	I don't want to hear what they have to say.
9086280	9087280	You know what I mean?
9087280	9090280	These people that get on there and say n-word, n-word, f-word, f-word.
9090280	9092280	You know who I'm talking about.
9092280	9094280	Like, is there a way I could just, like, block out their ratings?
9094280	9097280	If I block them on Xbox Live, will it block their ratings out too?
9097280	9099280	I do think it would be really smart,
9099280	9102280	and it would also, once again, go back to tying in.
9102280	9105280	Because you can do, like, with your Xbox Live arcade games,
9105280	9109280	you can see where you rank, like, in the leaderboards versus the world
9109280	9111280	versus, you know, your friends.
9111280	9114280	And I think their reviews should also be the same way.
9114280	9115280	If your friends have reviewed that,
9115280	9117280	you should be able to see their reviews,
9117280	9119280	or you can just see the community as a whole.
9119280	9120280	Ooh, like Netflix.
9120280	9122280	Netflix, perfect. Perfect model.
9122280	9124280	And Xbox has it in with Netflix anyway.
9124280	9125280	There you go.
9125280	9126280	There you go.
9126280	9127280	Steal from Netflix.
9127280	9128280	There's the answer.
9128280	9130280	Great.
9130280	9131280	All right.
9131280	9134280	Well, I want to move on to another story,
9134280	9135280	and it has to do with Microsoft.
9135280	9136280	A whole lot of Microsoft tonight.
9136280	9140280	But Project Natal, going back to that, talking about,
9140280	9142280	we were talking about it a little bit during Part A,
9142280	9145280	but it's made its mainstream television debut.
9145280	9146280	That's right.
9146280	9149280	It showed up on Late Night with Jimmy Fallon.
9149280	9151280	It showed up a little earlier this week.
9151280	9154280	Oop, I'm bringing up the actual Hulu thing here in studio,
9154280	9155280	although they're going to do a commercial here,
9155280	9156280	so I'm going to mute it for that,
9156280	9158280	because if the commercial people aren't going to pay us,
9158280	9160280	I'm not going to rebroadcast that.
9160280	9165280	But I do want to show a little bit about the whole Jimmy Fallon late night thing.
9165280	9168280	They actually showed Natal on it, and I don't know why,
9168280	9170280	but they all were wearing these red jumpsuits and things
9170280	9171280	when they were demoing it.
9171280	9175280	But certainly it was interesting, if nothing else,
9175280	9181280	to actually see this being played by somebody who wasn't a Microsoft spokesperson.
9181280	9182280	You know what I mean?
9182280	9185280	It was a real person at least checking this out.
9185280	9189280	All right, let's actually see if we can check this out just a little bit here.
9189280	9191280	It's a bunch of red shirts. Kill them.
9191280	9194280	I'm going to actually forward ahead a little bit here in the video
9194280	9196280	so we can actually see where they're playing.
9196280	9197280	My avatar walks with me.
9197280	9200280	How much room can you put this one in your dorm room?
9200280	9201280	Oh, totally.
9201280	9203280	We'll be able to fit it into all types of different living spaces
9203280	9205280	so anybody can get in and play it.
9205280	9207280	Now this is going to work with all Xbox 360s.
9207280	9209280	People already have any one that's bought in the future.
9209280	9210280	It all just works.
9210280	9211280	I want this now.
9211280	9212280	Excellent.
9212280	9214280	Well, I'm sure we can work out a deal for you.
9214280	9215280	Jimmy Fallon, you're not funny.
9215280	9216280	Still.
9216280	9217280	I'm going to do a little quick demo.
9217280	9220280	I'm going to forward a little ahead to where they're actually playing.
9220280	9222280	Come on.
9222280	9224280	You can see where the shadow is there.
9224280	9226280	It's like a 3D little breakout game.
9226280	9228280	This is one of the games they were showing actually
9228280	9230280	at E3 as one of the demos.
9230280	9231280	It's kind of cool.
9231280	9233280	Let me turn this down a little bit.
9233280	9236280	Yeah, it looks like fun to flail around like a fool for a little while,
9236280	9238280	but I don't know for how long.
9238280	9240280	Again, I don't think there's an actual game here,
9240280	9243280	but if this is a minigame in a much larger game,
9243280	9244280	I think this could be cool.
9244280	9247280	You're doing it like volleyball.
9247280	9250280	Yeah, I mean, the game, you know,
9250280	9252280	it looks like it might be fun for a little while.
9252280	9254280	I don't know about the longevity of it,
9254280	9255280	but a lot of weak games.
9255280	9256280	I think this is a demo.
9256280	9257280	This is a demo, though.
9257280	9259280	Yeah, but, okay, yeah.
9259280	9260280	To be fair, it's a tech demo.
9260280	9261280	No, like, games.
9261280	9262280	So was Wii Sports and Wii Play.
9262280	9265280	So a lot of the things you saw in Wii Play were tech demos, too.
9265280	9268280	I think this will come out if nothing else is an Xbox Live arcade game.
9268280	9269280	You'll see this.
9269280	9271280	They'll make a game out of this somehow.
9271280	9272280	But...
9272280	9274280	I think that there...
9274280	9278280	I honestly, though, see a whole lot of potential for this technology, though.
9278280	9280280	There really is.
9280280	9285280	Honestly, I'm not ready to pass judgment on it yet.
9285280	9286280	Really, I'm not.
9286280	9288280	sj100map makes a correction to something I was saying.
9288280	9291280	Correction, Rob, that was the only demo they did on stage, I believe.
9291280	9292280	That's a good point.
9292280	9294280	When they did that whole Milo thing, that was a pre-taped video.
9294280	9296280	But they did a demo on stage, though.
9296280	9300280	They did that exact same game on stage with Project Natal at the press conference.
9300280	9301280	Got it.
9301280	9304280	So this is like their touring game that they have to show at the stuff.
9304280	9306280	But still, the nice thing about it was,
9306280	9309280	it was, you know, say what you want to about Jimmy Fallon
9309280	9311280	and his humor or lack thereof.
9311280	9314280	He's not somebody in the game industry.
9314280	9317280	He's like a quote-unquote real person now demoing this.
9317280	9319280	So you know it wasn't rigged.
9319280	9320280	Does that make sense?
9320280	9321280	Yes.
9321280	9324280	You know, everything that happened was, you know, like a real thing.
9324280	9329280	So now I feel like this is really the first time we're really getting to see this in action.
9329280	9331280	Because Natal was hidden on the show floor.
9331280	9334280	And they weren't letting regular people play it.
9334280	9336280	Like, this was a huge step in actually seeing this.
9336280	9338280	By the way, sorry to get off track here,
9338280	9342280	but what is up with Jimmy Fallon, like, kind of like tapping into the game industry lately?
9342280	9347280	Well, that's what he says. His thing was that he wants to treat game releases like movie releases.
9347280	9350280	Like, he's a big gamer, I guess.
9350280	9354280	And apparently he's going to start doing more content like this.
9354280	9356280	Is that maybe because of his audience?
9356280	9359280	Because, you know, who stays up to watch Late Night College Kids?
9359280	9362280	Maybe he's trying to tap a new audience because, you know,
9362280	9365280	a lot of the audience that was fans of Conan moved to Conan.
9365280	9369280	And also maybe he realizes he's not that funny.
9369280	9371280	So, you know, stick with what you know.
9371280	9376280	Well, to be fair, you know what, to be fair, Conan had a real rough first six months.
9376280	9378280	You know, a lot of people wrote him off when the show first started.
9378280	9380280	He didn't find his niche for a year.
9380280	9382280	So I'm willing to give Jimmy Fallon a year. Whatever.
9382280	9387280	But all that aside, you know, he has been, you know, pretty decent, I guess, about coverage.
9387280	9394280	I feel like I'm getting more gaming coverage watching Jimmy Fallon than I am most times I'm watching G4, E3 Accepted.
9394280	9395280	You know what I mean?
9395280	9396280	Yeah.
9396280	9400280	They had Jason Sudeikis or whatever his name is kind of around at E3.
9400280	9406280	That's kind of funny. I like the little video they did for that.
9406280	9409280	Yeah, Kay Levster in chat makes a funny comment.
9409280	9413280	He wants to get his games for free, thus now he's scared.
9413280	9416280	Tigerclaw says Jimmy Fallon is a bit of a tech geek.
9416280	9419280	He had the guys from Dignation on the show before.
9419280	9422280	He's living up to his promising of promoting video games.
9422280	9427280	Well, I'm glad somebody is.
9427280	9435280	Alright, well, regardless, it was kind of nice to see Natal actually kind of making a show on a big, you know, well, I don't know if you want to say big,
9435280	9444280	but a fair show that has at least a million people watching it and getting, you know, a live real person who doesn't work for the company playing it.
9444280	9445280	Hmm.
9445280	9449280	No, it kind of changed topics a little bit.
9449280	9456280	Apparently, Alexey Pajitnov, the creator of Tetris.
9456280	9462280	Of course, you know, Tetris just had its 25th anniversary not too long ago.
9462280	9472280	Apparently, he's saying that he wants, well, it's, you know, so huge right now with, you know, with like 125 million copies sold.
9472280	9478280	And, you know, probably one of the, I think one of the biggest, most recognized games out there.
9478280	9483280	He's saying they could see probably an evolution of Tetris becoming a sport.
9483280	9489280	Of course, the future is that a country that has 48 million people living in it,
9489280	9494280	and the biggest casual gaming site in the country has 24 million registered users.
9494280	9495280	That country is Korea.
9495280	9498280	That's what's going to happen in the rest of the world.
9498280	9505280	So kind of like, you know, everybody competing in this first virtual sport.
9505280	9512280	Sports like baseball and football were created at a time when their future was a lifetime of physical activities and physical fitness.
9512280	9514280	But now that's not as important.
9514280	9517280	It's more about mental fitness today.
9517280	9520280	And Tetris is a virtual sport that exercises the mind.
9520280	9525280	That's the definition of a virtual sport.
9525280	9530280	So how exactly would, I guess I'm not getting it, how exactly, where would the sport be in this?
9530280	9531280	Competing one-on-one.
9531280	9536280	It's just, you know, a bunch of people in a Tetris tournament.
9536280	9538280	The end.
9538280	9539280	Hmm.
9539280	9545280	Interesting, though, that it seems like we always have this video games as a sport discussion comes up once in a while.
9545280	9546280	Remember when they wanted to make DDR a sport?
9546280	9548280	Or they did in a couple of countries.
9548280	9549280	I know, but here's the thing.
9549280	9554280	I think we're looking at it, when we say sports, we think physical sports.
9554280	9557280	And he's trying to say that there's other sports out there, like chess.
9557280	9559280	Chess is not a physical sport.
9559280	9561280	I mean, you play it physically, but it's more mental.
9561280	9563280	Is chess at the Olympics?
9563280	9565280	I don't think so.
9565280	9566280	I don't know.
9566280	9567280	That's a very good question.
9567280	9569280	I wonder if one of our chatters knows.
9569280	9571280	Is chess an Olympic sport?
9571280	9572280	I don't think it is.
9572280	9573280	Hmm.
9573280	9574280	But like, you know, stuff like that.
9574280	9581280	You know, nowadays, you know, with a lot of gamers out there now, they have, you know, the, you know, championship gaming stuff that they do,
9581280	9588280	which making, you know, people into actual teams and stuff like that and promoting them like a football team and stuff.
9588280	9591280	That's cool and all, but I don't know.
9591280	9593280	That's not really the model I see.
9593280	9595280	Three no's in chat, by the way.
9595280	9597280	Chess is not an Olympic sport.
9597280	9604280	And, in fact, I even Googled it, and there was an article in Time Magazine, August 5th of 2008, chess and bridge enthusiasts,
9604280	9608280	they are lobbying the International Olympic Committee to allow their games.
9608280	9609280	I don't think that they should be.
9609280	9613280	I mean, the Olympics is a physical sports competition.
9613280	9615280	It shouldn't be.
9615280	9619280	You know, DDR shouldn't be really a sport.
9619280	9622280	I mean, you play it physically, but it's not...
9622280	9631280	Oh, DDR is hard to compete in anyways. It's basically about accuracy and, you know, as far as a way to actually grade it and freestyle and stuff.
9631280	9634280	It's kind of stupid because that's just interpretive dance, so I don't know.
9634280	9636280	Well, but they have interpretive dance in the Olympics.
9636280	9641280	Yeah, and why do you need DDR? I would think it'd be retarded, and it would only give Konami more reasons.
9641280	9647280	DDR is more of a... Oh, God, not to get down on this, but in its heyday, DDR would have been better suited for something like the X Games,
9647280	9651280	or something, you know, like an ESPN2 Olympics, you know what I mean?
9651280	9653280	ESPN8, the Ocho.
9653280	9655280	Exactly, the Ocho Olympics.
9655280	9659280	So why shouldn't Tetris be on... Did you ever see the movie Dodgeball?
9659280	9660280	No.
9660280	9662280	Because Jamie's giving us this look of, like, what the hell are you guys saying?
9662280	9663280	That's the joke.
9663280	9665280	I want to know what planet you're from.
9665280	9667280	Alright, anyway.
9667280	9671280	What else? Ah, now I lost my train of thought. Choo-choo, derailed.
9673280	9677280	Is this the type of thing that he thinks should be televised, or what?
9677280	9678280	I guess we don't know, but...
9678280	9683280	I don't know. I mean, this is just him making a comment, and bloggers picking up on it, like, going,
9683280	9685280	Oh my God, he thinks it should be a sport!
9685280	9693280	Well, if it, let's say it was the type of sport that you would see on the Ocho, or, you know, in all reality, ESPN2 or something like that, would you watch it?
9693280	9694280	Nope.
9694280	9707280	I'm curious, chatters, if Tetris was a sport, and they broadcast the big, uh, the big showdowns live on ESPN or ESPN2 or ABC Wild World of Sports, would you watch it?
9707280	9710280	I guess this all goes into competitive gaming.
9710280	9711280	Human Tetris.
9711280	9717280	They, well, they did make a show out of that, aren't they? Isn't that going to be a show on Fox or something?
9717280	9719280	It is already. Yeah, it's The Wall.
9719280	9724280	It was like, they did it as a gag on Ellen, like, five minutes a week or something.
9724280	9730280	Well, it was in Japan. It's an actual show in Japan, and they do it for fun there, but, you know, we have to do it for prizes.
9730280	9733280	No such thing as fun and game shows.
9733280	9741280	Osfer in chat says, I go to Ohio tournaments often, and I can say that DDR is definitely competitive enough to be an Olympic sport.
9741280	9743280	Chat.orangelandradio.com.
9743280	9747280	Kay Levster says, watching Tetris is like watching golf, so, no.
9747280	9749280	There's a whole channel dedicated to golf, though, mind you.
9749280	9750280	Exactly.
9750280	9751280	A whole channel.
9751280	9759280	It would, it just wouldn't be something that, I mean, it's hard to make it interesting, I guess.
9759280	9763280	If you're going to say no to that, though, what about competitive gaming on TV?
9763280	9765280	Should we just not have competitive gaming on TV, then?
9765280	9772280	Like the, you know, Counter-Strike tournaments and, you know, whatever the first person shooter hit of the week happens to be that they're playing online?
9772280	9774280	Should they not be televised, either?
9774280	9780280	No, I don't think it's an issue of them being televised at all. It's just a way of how we're able to capture it and film it.
9780280	9786280	Sports, that's easy to televise because you can, you know, usually all the gameplay and stuff is going on in one area.
9786280	9789280	You can, you know, zoom back to catch the whole field and stuff like that.
9789280	9792280	Like, doing Counter-Strike, you can't really film that.
9792280	9797280	There's no way that you can see everything that's going on all at once because of the nature of the game it is.
9797280	9800280	You have to kind of focus on the different players and stuff.
9800280	9810280	I guess, I don't know, it's, you know, NASCAR, you can kind of do that kind of stuff where you can film the whole pack of cars and stuff, but they do like the in-car camps and that kind of thing.
9810280	9819280	But, it's just hard to film it and make it interesting in the same way as like a football game or a baseball game or something like that.
9819280	9826280	Where they've been doing it for years and they've figured out, you know, they have commentators and know what they're talking about and stuff like that.
9826280	9835280	It's like, you know, if you started filming Counter-Strike or something like that and you started talking about it, you know, and you had, you know, commentators going,
9835280	9839240	this person so I don't know who these people are I'm aware that counter-strike
9839240	9843600	exists and what it basically is but I don't know who any of these players are
9843600	9848480	and this wouldn't really be interesting to me I don't know it's it's just it's
9848480	9855320	really tough to broadcast and you're not going to get the same responses like the
9855320	9861160	NFL or something the Rob D in chat makes comment that see this is the problem
9861160	9864640	competitive gaming how many different things can happen in football you might
9864640	9868320	see something that you've never seen before every week in DDR the
9868320	9871060	participants aren't even interacting it's a matter of seeing who scores the
9871060	9874360	most I think it would take a lot more animations and reactions to make it more
9874360	9877860	it is hard to like with a fighting game or something like that I think the
9877860	9882020	fighting game would be the easiest thing to film because it's all one screen you
9882020	9886880	can see all the action all at once you know but the problem is it's moving so
9886880	9892320	fast it's hard to commentate on that you can't really commentate where there's
9892320	9896800	baseball there's a punch in there oh my gosh I do get no my gosh it is a super
9896800	9901400	combo attack on the kind of you know it was baseball and football there's a lot
9901400	9905320	of you know different you know pauses in the game where you can catch up the
9905320	9909120	speeds the instant replays that kind of stuff they've figured out of filling you
9909120	9915400	know the gaps but it's just it's too difficult to film this like it like a
9915400	9919280	sport I think a little bit of back and forth going on ospher says it's still
9919280	9923240	competing whoever can get the highest score on max unlimited isn't really that
9923240	9929520	different than who can get the best time on a 100 meter dash hmm also a lot of
9929520	9933160	talk about that old show arena on g4 a lot of fans of that show in our chat
9933160	9936600	room right now I wasn't that big on arena you know why because it was so
9936600	9940120	heavily edited you were only really seeing the highlights of every match and
9940120	9942760	I don't know like I felt like I didn't learn enough about the game and the
9942760	9947240	actual strategy and how to get better from just seeing and it was so fast the
9947240	9950240	way they went back and forth from all the different piece I didn't never felt
9950240	9954040	like I really understood what was going on watching that show maybe it's just
9954040	9956920	because I'm not into first-person shooters as much as I am other games but
9956920	9960760	that was my problem see they could do like something I'm I don't even know if
9960760	9964360	a game exists out there like that would like Call of Duty 4 actually this be
9964360	9968560	more like operation of flashpoint 2 I think because it's more open-world but
9968560	9971320	like you could do something where you have two different teams you can show
9971320	9975920	them strategizing you you know about the game beforehand you know planning out
9975920	9978640	stuff they could talk about the different possibilities how they may be
9978640	9982320	able to like okay your team you know the red team right here can you know go down
9982320	9985800	flank under this you know through this valley or something like that you know
9985800	9989120	but then they have to watch out so there's a lot of commentary in like
9989120	9994760	visual aids that they could do there but it's just it's really tough once again
9994760	9999440	and I am pretty much stresses almost every sentence now it's really tough to
9999440	10005320	film this stuff to make it interesting you just I don't know it's unless it's
10005320	10009320	like you know a NASCAR game or like Project Gotham would kind of work
10009320	10013040	because they had the spectator mode where you can actually watch the cars
10013040	10017680	and stuff racing around almost like as you were you know watching a you know
10017680	10021920	television production of you know race so you could do something similar like
10021920	10025720	that and that might work as far as commentary and stuff goes you know maybe
10025720	10032400	like a Ridge Racer would be kind of interesting but you know it really it's
10032400	10037960	only specific types of games and I don't know first-person shooters are really
10037960	10042320	going to work because it's so massive and there's so much stuff going on SSJ
10042320	10045040	100 Matt says this and we're going to move on try to get towards the end of
10045040	10049200	the show here the fact is statistics and ratings show people don't really care
10049200	10053600	for watching people playing video games yet Starcraft televised competitions
10053600	10059760	works in Korea Tiger Claw in chat says the problem was showing live gameplay of
10059760	10063520	attorney is the action can get very repetitive and the average viewer will
10063520	10067020	get bored by it Wallace gamers are used to seeing the repetitiveness of the
10067020	10070000	games all right we're going to leave it there if you have further comments you
10070000	10073480	can always send us an email mailbag orange lounge radio.com but we want to
10073480	10077840	get to the F use of the week and of course something has to inspire the F use
10077840	10082880	of the week what better than a stupid gamer doing something stupid it was a
10082880	10088720	brotherly argument over video games it was an 11 year old Mississippi kid
10088720	10093800	shooting a nine-year-old brother in the chest with a shotgun according to
10093800	10097640	Sheriff Kenny Dickerson from Mark Marshall County the younger brother
10097640	10103080	allegedly got mad because he beat got beat at some video games and got the gun
10103080	10106920	the older brother said the weapon automatically went off when the two
10106920	10115880	fought over it so yeah by the way they're saying that is unlikely the kid
10115880	10120480	will be charged because he is under 13 years old and the entire incident
10120480	10126680	appeared to be an accident anyway that's the part that disturbs me a lot like a
10126680	10135840	lot like I realize he's a child but oh my god like not a mention of the parents
10135840	10139600	and like what parent keeps a shotgun accessible to their 11 year old and
10139600	10145520	obviously not you know a good one oh this just gives gamers everywhere a bad
10145520	10149000	name to I hate it when stories like this are picked up by video game blogs too
10149000	10151800	because it's just kind of like this really didn't have anything to do with
10151800	10155440	video games yeah they fought over video games but you'll maybe not so much the
10155440	10158120	gamer blogs I hate it when the mainstream media picks up these stories
10158120	10161720	because it makes gamers look violent when this really has nothing to do with
10161720	10167080	the video games this has everything to do with just blatant stupidity and bad
10167080	10175000	bad bad terrible pain or parenting hmm so with that the F use of the week
10175000	10193160	Oh dark soccer would you care to start us off with a rant of your own tonight
10193160	10202960	if you do not let shit go Loki f you to moving especially my cat which it's not
10202960	10206880	really her fault but she can't sleep right now because she's worried and
10206880	10211400	doesn't know what's going on cats having trouble adjusting to places so she kept
10211400	10216000	this up all night Oh and F you to myself for accidentally breaking the water line
10216000	10222720	going to my fridge causing it to drip but in defense I think it's broken

10228320	10234800	this morning fix it after you to people that you thought were great friends that
10234800	10239600	seemed to disappear off the face of the planet altogether you know it just kind
10239600	10242920	of sucks like to be felt like sometimes you're being dropped like a hot potato
10242920	10249800	in I don't know for whatever reason so it's kind of stinks you know friends
10249800	10252840	supposed to stick by each other through thick and thin sometimes I get the
10252840	10257960	feeling that's not happening so F you to those general feelings of angst I hope
10257960	10266680	I'm just I hope it's all in my head all right let's move on towards the end of
10266680	10270400	the program here I think we're going to get into the rapid-fire news tonight so

10467480	10471160	finish it but if you don't care to wait for that I think the PlayStation blog
10471160	10477360	has all the information as far as what's going on there so check it out if you
10477360	10478360	want to spoil it
10478360	10486120	alright well before we wrap up the show we are going to open up the sky plane
10486120	10489760	take your calls but first we didn't get to the classic game of the week in part
10489760	10493680	a we got to get that taken care of tonight it just wouldn't be a week here
10493680	10497120	at orange long radio without the classic game of the week so every week dark
10497120	10500320	soccer likes to dig through the great archive of gaming and pull out a game
10500320	10504120	that you people ought to be playing it's the classic game of the week and here it
10504120	10505120	is
10505120	10514080	what should the kids be playing this week Donkey Kong jr. seriously it is
10514080	10518480	seriously classic game it's one where Donkey Kong's little kid wearing a
10518480	10523920	diaper has to go rescue Donkey Kong from Mario who has captured him and
10523920	10528840	basically you just climb on ropes and drop fruit on these mechanized little
10528840	10534480	big mouth trap thingy these and then you have you know an electrical stage in
10534480	10545400	different areas it's actually supposed to be the the guy Steve Wiebe had the
10545400	10550320	highest score on this one actually and he did pass Billy Mitchell on this so
10550320	10555400	the untold story yeah I don't know that Billy Mitchell has surpassed it actually
10555400	10561440	since then his score was one million thirty three thousand points and Steve
10561440	10566040	Wiebe got one million one thousand thirty nine eight hundred points I have
10566040	10568960	this on several systems like the NES there's actually a game and watch
10568960	10574640	version the NES version was the launch title in Japan we have got it on a
10574640	10578920	virtual console there was an e-reader card it was an Animal Crossing so yeah
10578920	10584960	it's a pretty pretty classic this is one of the few Nintendo games I actually had
10584960	10588440	there was a combo pack that came out on the NES back in the day that was like
10588440	10591720	both Donkey Kong junior games and I had that actually I was one of the first
10591720	10598760	Antonio games I had so that's cool I played this on the Coleco yeah it's old
10598760	10601640	school you know what I actually kind of like this game better a little bit than
10601640	10604200	Donkey Kong I don't know why I guess I just like the whole concept of the vine
10604200	10608600	climbing and that you kind of go faster if you're willing to go across to be a
10608600	10614000	really fast when you slide down it's interesting all right if nothing else to
10614000	10617280	say on this game from Dark Soccer then that's gonna do it for your classic game
10617280	10622400	of the week Donkey Kong jr. on just about every freaking system ever made
10622400	10627760	but originally in the arcade an old-school Nintendo classic there you

10666200	10672120	well if you've been following my Twitter blog I've been like not feeling it not
10672120	10676760	feeling it cuz there's been delays guests canceling but when I got there
10676760	10681240	and got to the groove of things it was fun and I really enjoyed myself this
10681240	10684240	year I have to be honest I've kind of been off Twitter all weekend I've been
10684240	10688440	so busy just running from place to place doing well it's nice again I can't you
10688440	10692640	know I it's nice having a show at social life but yeah I've been so busy I've
10692640	10697120	kind of been off Twitter but I can't understandable I know what you mean you
10697120	10700800	know sometimes you're just kind of not in the mood but then you get there and
10700800	10703720	it somehow all comes together like haven't you ever done that like there's
10703720	10707280	been like a party and you don't really want to go but maybe there's like either
10707280	10711200	a significant other or it's an important friend having the party or something you
10711200	10714240	know yeah and you're just not feeling it but you're like alright I'm gonna go
10714240	10717840	because I have to and maybe I'll stay for an hour then find an excuse to leave
10717840	10721360	like I have severe diarrhea or something right but then you get there and you're
10721360	10724400	like oh I'm actually having a good time it just kind of seems to all come
10724400	10730880	together like that yep that's how it was yeah so all right well what about you
10730880	10733720	know we're a gaming show so I always have to ask you how is the gaming
10733720	10739080	representation at the con was it was there good stuff there yeah um first up
10739080	10744600	they had a room just for rock band they had it projected onto a large wall which
10744600	10751840	is about 60 feet walk like about 60 feet wide pretty much mm-hmm it was a dark
10751840	10756160	room and I walked in everybody was singing living on a prayer was it is
10756160	10759400	this rock band room something where like people just randomly walk in and watch
10759400	10763600	people play rock band I mean is that yeah I mean you would wait your turn to
10763600	10766320	play but at the same time there was chair so we could sit down and watch
10766320	10773040	him play I bet you see a lot of great talent though yes definitely sort of
10773040	10778840	like an anime idol something like that and also there was also a beta test for
10778840	10785720	um DJ hero there oh really yeah really so wait so you actually have to play DJ
10785720	10793680	hero yeah it's called beat mania 2dx but um bomb nice well hold on the Rama Rama
10793680	10798680	I I said this in part a the games have nothing in common they really don't if
10798680	10802800	you've got to make that comparison beat mania and scratch but beat mania DJ
10802800	10806880	hero no it doesn't work it doesn't where they're get dick there today they're two
10806880	10810840	games that happen to use a turntable they're so different but here's the
10810840	10815440	thing though I wasn't the one that made the joke cuz I walked in I saw the sign
10815440	10820280	I've run over to the other side the game room cuz I know when a guy is over I'm
10820280	10825400	like what's up with DJ here it was like no it's 2dx dudes 2dx I'm like haha
10825400	10830400	funny oh so they made the joke uh-huh well please encourage them to go listen
10830400	10834280	to part a tonight cuz I'd have some pretty strong words for them I will I
10834280	10837000	definitely will all right Rama I gotta let you go to get more calls but thanks
10837000	10840640	so much for your call and have fun now on the anime circuit come in got it all
10840640	10846280	right later let's see I'm looking at so because some of the chat rooms talking
10846280	10849800	about anime next a little bit here legend Zaku says I mean X was pretty
10849800	10852880	damn lackluster compared to previous years although the venue kicked ass this
10852880	10858100	year Oscar says I can't wait until mid-july when I go to Otacon and Rob
10858100	10861600	Diaz pimping his panel called games that push your buttons it is pretty funny
10861600	10864680	though if you're going Otacon check that out hi Aaron orange launch radio who's
10864680	10869200	this Zaku Zaku I was just reading a comment of yours is this call about
10869200	10874660	anime next or what yeah I was there that weekend and I didn't room with Adam this
10874660	10879200	year but I managed to find enough cash to go and split a room with someone else
10879200	10883960	even though it wasn't far it was no wasn't far from the venue but I still
10883960	10889840	managed to make it regardless oh just to just to touch up on what he briefly said
10889840	10893960	I kind of had a different experience this year in anime next I mean the venue
10893960	10899040	kicked severe ass because it was it was a lot better in terms of the game room
10899040	10902680	being big and all and actually have it separate rooms but I don't know I just
10902680	10905920	wasn't feeling it this year I mean previous years it was pretty I was
10905920	10909440	pretty much hyped and it pretty much went through but I don't know I guess
10909440	10914280	this year when I'd have been like a I'd have been you know wasn't what I expected
10914280	10918280	but whatever guess we'll try for the next year what anyway what was missing
10918280	10923000	for you was it was the game room lacking or what no the game room was fine that
10923000	10926720	was I had nothing to do with it it's just like it wasn't I don't know if for
10926720	10930560	some reason I wasn't really getting into some of the other panels I see like when
10930560	10933920	I first went to anime next two years ago I was really getting into an adult swim
10933920	10939200	panel that I got in there and maybe a couple of anime but it wasn't I wasn't
10939200	10943320	feeling it this year unfortunately I'm sorry I'll let you get to whatever your
10943320	10947000	anyways is but I have been to a lot of conventions myself and I'm not even that
10947000	10950240	super into anime but I've seen a lot of piss-poor panels at conventions I'm
10950240	10955280	sorry to say there's not like no nice way for me to say it yeah people stop
10955280	10960360	using panels as an excuse to get a free badge and fucking do do a good panel and
10960360	10964840	this goes both ways convention organizers screen your panelists better
10964840	10970280	do not let your friend host a panel because they are your friend unless that
10970280	10975680	friend is able to produce an outline ideas like everyone should have to knock
10975680	10979600	it off you're ruining your own con anyway sorry well there was there was
10979600	10983240	the particular one that I wanted to go to but you know it had to do with
10983240	10987320	Bahmani stuff it was actually on Friday but by the time I made it there I was
10987320	10991680	you know I had to like take my roommate to the hotel and check in and get food
10991680	10996080	so I pretty much missed it by the time I got there what exactly are those Bahmani
10996080	11000120	panels like these days damn we're in trouble no idea but it was held on
11000120	11004920	Friday and Friday evening and I had to arrive in the con at that time to get my
11004920	11008500	badge so it wasn't even worth it they were nice enough to let me sit in on the
11008500	11012080	bahmanistyle.com panel at ASEN and you know as cool as it was to be
11012080	11015200	sitting with some of those folks I really didn't feel like there was a lot
11015200	11019340	to talk about a lot of the discussions focused around the concert that had
11019340	11022400	happened the night before which is cool for the folks that are into that type of
11022400	11025000	music I felt really lost or what have you because I haven't been following a
11025000	11028100	lot of new Ryan's but when it came to actual talk on the Bahmani games like
11028100	11033440	half of it was a joke it was it right anyway most of it for you know I even
11033440	11036520	though I wasn't I wasn't actually there an ace and I could have could only
11036520	11040920	imagine it's probably like insider info probably like inside joke something that
11040920	11044960	would be a lot of inside jokes in the line you had any ways a minute ago
11044960	11049820	Zaku please please go ahead with your anyways anyways I would basically a
11049820	11053680	reason I call tonight is because you know I don't know if you probably know
11053680	11059640	this but DDRX apparently hit arcades last week and the first one being the
11059640	11063680	Levo the game works in Chicago that managed to get the first the first new
11063680	11070540	cabin in the country and from from the initial reviews horrible let's just let
11070540	11074320	just put it this way the fact that the cab managed to go down to the the cabin
11074320	11080080	itself managed to go down to $10,000 as opposed to 15 you know previous releases
11080080	11086720	they pretty much cut many corners noticeable corners like a laggy H you
11086720	11091080	know like the LCD monitor a pad that's like half the the thickness of the
11091080	11096920	original one the sense you know sensors in the arrows are pretty much they're
11096920	11100560	just triggering or not even home just triggering spread and spontaneous so
11100560	11105800	you're not holding it all just a lot of bullshit on that part run on the part of
11105800	11110920	maybe bets in or an army for that matter just producing piss for new cabinets you
11110920	11115160	know what I'm not surprised go back to last week's show as far as I'm concerned
11115160	11119880	wheel that machine out to the barn and put a bullet in it it's done yeah at
11119880	11124760	this point is like people are just writing DDRX off at this point because
11124760	11128840	of the fact that the cabinets are just giving it a they're just giving it a bad
11128840	11134240	rap I'm like I mean the upgrade kids haven't even been released yet but we
11134240	11138800	have yet to see how they fare but so far the new cabinets just they're not
11138800	11144280	sitting well with the fans the hardcore players I'm sadly not surprised that go
11144280	11146840	we got to let you go so we can wrap up the show but thanks so much for calling
11146840	11151800	in all right take care they're a little fatter too and nobody likes fat is it
11151800	11154560	just me or does it sound like and we're gonna turn off the Skype for tonight so
11154560	11156720	we can wrap up the show but thank you guys so much if you didn't get in
11156720	11159760	remember you can always send us an email mailbag at orange laundry calm we do
11159760	11164160	want your voice to be heard it is just me it sounds like this new
11164160	11168280	machine like is like two DDR solo pads put together when you talk about the
11168280	11172040	less responsive arrows and the thinner pads or whatever it sounds like a DDR
11172040	11175640	solo machine all right I was like cutting costs to me you have a perfectly
11175640	11180200	good cabinet that's worked for how many years now let's go and change it that's
11180200	11185760	an awesome idea I never thought I would say this seven years ago when this whole
11185760	11189440	show started and yes we're coming up on our seven seven year anniversary so show
11189440	11195000	in two weeks believe it or not this first show is June 23rd 2002 I never
11195000	11199560	thought I would say this seven years ago but we've talked too much about DDR the
11199560	11204280	past two shows like that's how relevant it is right now in this world we can
11204280	11208480	bring it back I could bring it back they just know the confidence in me no it's
11208480	11213720	it's not gonna happen oh it would sorry Loki it would but it's not going it
11213720	11217880	could yes it could all right we got to go around and get everybody's final
11217880	11222000	thought and wrap up the show tonight and take care of it oh did you have any
11222000	11226000	other like last things you want to even talk release dates oh my god we didn't
11226000	11229400	do we want to go over those real quick could do that that's what happens when
11229400	11233160	you try a new format is that you forget shit all right well then Loki why don't
11233160	11236240	you go over some release dates for the u.s. before we wrap it up all right well
11236240	11240360	this week we've got a quite a few games coming out but something you probably
11240360	11248040	want to pick up Ghostbusters coming out on PlayStation 2 3 Xbox 360 we DS and PS
11248040	11255280	maybe the PSP yeah no that's right another PSP um let's see big league
11255280	11262400	sports summer coming out we and DS flowers and rain if you're a fan of you
11262400	11267240	know the killer seven and those types of games but grasshoppers doing this one on
11267240	11272720	DS it's weird I actually played the import of the European one and it's kind
11272720	11278640	of weird guitar heroes smash hits coming out on PlayStation 2 3 Xbox 360 and the
11278640	11286560	Wii if you're into more of the sim games discovery kids parrot pals and diva
11286560	11294080	girls divas on ice on Wii and the DS Monster Hunter freedom unite on PSP
11294080	11299000	that's gonna be pretty awesome and that's pretty much it
11299000	11303000	Japan's looking a little thin on the releases this week but you do get a
11303000	11307120	price drop on Metal Gear Solid four guns of the Patriots on June 18th on the
11307120	11310880	PlayStation 3 remember this is Japanese release dates I'm reading right now
11310880	11314960	sometimes they get cool stuff before we do right now they're not getting a lot
11314960	11317920	there isn't a single thing of note coming out on the Wii this week believe
11317920	11321320	it or not and usually in Japan even a slow week you have something coming out
11321320	11325080	on the Wii on the PlayStation 2 you have a couple other price drops going on
11325080	11329480	mostly they are Neo Geo games like King of Fighters maximum impact regulation a
11329480	11333680	metal slug complete samurai spirits all of those games are getting price
11333680	11338840	reductions and perhaps this is in preparation for the sunsoft collection
11338840	11341360	which is also coming out I think that's actually another price drop though
11341360	11344520	they're all get just price drop price drop price drop this week over in Japan
11344520	11349840	on the Nintendo DS there is a gogo 13 game coming out believe not remember
11349840	11354000	that is there that was a old-school I'm going to make a moonwalk that's right

11419160	11425080	looking at the PSP fate unlimited codes portable comes out this week from Capcom
11425080	11431040	on the PSP that looks to be a fun little game especially if you're into those
11431040	11436040	Japanese fighting games I have some rapid-fire last-minute stories once you
11436040	11439360	get some of the European news sure let's have time to do European days will do
11439360	11443200	your last few stories then get out of here for the night it's almost 945 in
11443200	11446960	the west coast yeah I need people are in my house actually I love you guys
11446960	11449760	actually being over here cuz you know being in this little room doesn't feel
11449760	11453880	sort of like the old school way we did it it does get go it does but Dan is
11453880	11457320	making arrangements for us potentially yeah I'm hearing we might move to where
11457320	11461120	the pinball machines are now you give me a little earlier to the garage where we
11461120	11463240	met that we might bump the pinball machines for the show could be
11463240	11467920	interesting but we we did trade creatures in the Black Lagoon for Lord
11467920	11473720	of the Rings I miss not broken already I miss not having to commute but I guess
11473720	11476520	if you guys have done it for so long I can do it for a little while at least so
11476520	11481480	yeah well how about our your European releases how about it on the 16th we
11481480	11486760	have Wallace and Gromit's grand adventures muzzled for PC and on 17th we
11486760	11490960	have rocket riot which kind of sounds a little dirty to me the 18th Metal Gear
11490960	11495680	Solid on PlayStation 3 and then the 19th we have rock band unplugged virtual
11495680	11503480	tennis 2009 and Ghostbusters Ghostbusters by the way yes I really
11503480	11507880	like that infamous game really yeah good somebody was just asking a little while
11507880	11510920	ago why we don't talk about it on the show I haven't played much of it just
11510920	11515520	because I've had a whole lot going on you know but it's totally between the
11515520	11519800	guy coasting through the air with electricity and then being spider-man
11519800	11525440	it's kind of funny meet the guy from crackdown I'm glad you said something
11525440	11528480	about it I hope the listener who sent in that email listens to the end of the
11528480	11533520	show so there you go all right Loki had some other stories you want to get to
11533520	11539240	yes well what game out there could possibly create a peripheral that is 20
11539240	11543440	times more expensive than the game itself well that game of course would be
11543440	11550600	virtual on they do have a $300 arcade stick that you can get for the Xbox
11550600	11555980	360 version it is from hori and yes it is 20 times the cost of the game which
11555980	11561600	is only 15 bucks but it does have the twin sticks and go crazy with that so I
11561600	11566800	wonder if you know how they had those little converter units where you could
11566800	11571320	use like a PlayStation controller on the Xbox 360 you know the different ones you
11571320	11576920	have to remap them and everything I wonder if there wouldn't be some type of
11576920	11581040	converter that they can make the work use my dreamcast sticks I don't know I
11581040	11585400	was then again I can just play it on dreamcast this is gonna sound so random
11585400	11590120	but I have to say something I just realized you're wearing a DDR spot.com
11590120	11594960	shirt yes I am that is fucking old school you know when I got this shirt
11594960	11600960	yeah I got this shirt at my madness sure has to be as old as this show
11600960	11609480	older I threw I threw away the other day my DDR mania X shirt I still have two
11609480	11613000	DDR freak shirts left to you but now keep in mind no this is the thing
11613000	11618160	remember when I got this it fit me oh yeah it's like that's like that's a
11618160	11622960	pajamas now that's a sleepy shirt now yeah well good for you it's it's it's
11622960	11630160	shirt I can wear without a bra well thanks for sharing okay low-key sorry
11630160	11634360	well with the news of Left 4 Dead 2 possibly dividing the community maybe
11634360	11639240	this will bring the community back together Left 4 Dead has finally got a
11639240	11644960	nude Zoe mod for PC version yes that's right what came out what came out there
11644960	11648480	with a female character would not be complete without a nude mod so I think
11648480	11653880	we can all agree on that that nudity mods are a must and that's available on
11653880	11664440	L4D mods.com got a lot of stuff nudity brings us together yes see here
11664440	11671400	apparently Final Fantasy Tactics has been raided by the ESRB and people
11671400	11675160	believe it's coming to the PlayStation Network sounds about right to me nice
11675160	11680840	releasing a lonely crap nice I've been I have been so Jones and for the old
11680840	11684320	school Final Fantasy Tactics like before it was on DS and all the other ones I
11684320	11689680	really want to play like on my TV again Final Fantasy Tactics that Oh happy
11689680	11693920	happy Rob yes kind of sad that I'll have to buy it all over again because I can't
11693920	11697200	find my original PlayStation 1 disc but what can you do at least I'll have my
11697200	11699720	Final Fantasy 8 discs so when they release that I'm not going to buy it
11699720	11702400	because I still have my discs so I could play it on the PlayStation 3 if I wanted
11702400	11708560	to yes apparently there's a rumor that Sony is going to unveil PSP Go apps and
11708560	11714320	small games at gamescom and these are supposed to be of course non retail
11714320	11719680	games and applications for the PSP and the file sizes are said to be limited to
11719680	11723520	100 megabytes but developers and publishers will be limited other create
11723520	11729400	other creative ways Sony is said to have some specifically stated non game apps
11729400	11741840	and 2d tiles are more than welcome maker comparisons to iPhone now yes God I
11741840	11745960	don't want to report on this but apparently there is another teaser site
11745960	11754680	in Japan now for a brand new tingle game and I weep with sadness I weep tears of
11754680	11762200	joy thank you for reporting that Loki is that it and finally Nintendo apparently
11762200	11771560	has according I guess Guardian media technologies it was one of the patent
11771560	11775520	lawsuits that Nintendo had to deal with well it's been thrown out of the court
11775520	11780680	it says we are very pleased with the court's decision and Nintendo vigorously
11780680	11784360	defends its patent lawsuits and at the earliest stages of this case Nintendo
11784360	11788760	convinced the court to dismiss the case as guardians patent had nothing to do
11788760	11793080	with Nintendo's products well I and I would despite all the crap I give
11793080	11795520	Nintendo I think I agree with them here there's too many of these frivolous
11795520	11800080	patent lawsuits if there's a patent lawsuit that's out there and they find
11800080	11803720	that they have you know infringed on that patent then how could there be
11803720	11808000	multiple lawsuits later on for the same types of things because I think at that
11808000	11811600	case well you've already found that you've been infringing on this patent
11811600	11814960	you need to go after that person because that's the person that has a patent for
11814960	11820560	it not Nintendo and that's it all right well that's gonna do it here for another
11820560	11824760	week of orange lounge radio we need to get everybody's final thought my god the
11824760	11828640	show just keeps going tonight three hours and counting Loki your final
11828640	11831280	thought tonight I'm gonna have to play some more fuel and then I'll have to
11831280	11835920	play with you online with fuel my final thought is I am so down just let me know
11835920	11840880	when they'll be fun all right Dar Sakura I don't think a miracle from God could
11840880	11846800	make Star Trek 5 a good movie you do know they're on like Star Trek 10 at this
11846800	11850680	point right I know but I was going back and reading 20 facts about Star Trek 10
11850680	11856080	I see from Trek movie calm which I will post in chat all right hey but it did
