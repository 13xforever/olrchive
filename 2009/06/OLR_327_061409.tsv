31872	32953	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
49651	51292	We still got Tech Master Loki here tonight
71562	72162	Yes, I'm here.
72303	73703	The very busy Techmaster Loki.
73943	74644	Yes, I'm moving.
74984	76945	Yes, you've been moving lately.
76985	77606	How's that going?
77626	79587	It sucks.
80307	80647	Yeah?
81068	81788	Yeah.
82008	86431	But I don't know if the listeners are aware, but you actually moved from an apartment to your house.
86771	89172	Not a rented house, but one you have actually purchased.
89293	89553	Yes.
89753	92975	In this very sad economy, you were actually able to make it work.
93135	95776	Someone else's misfortune turned into your gain.
95876	96717	Thank you, Fannie Mae.
98883	99443	No, seriously.
99483	102104	They had a really kick-ass loan deal.
102684	104405	Got a really low interest rate.
104985	112228	Normally, buyers like us, because we're not putting down a lot of money, you would have to pay mortgage insurance, which...
113789	114290	DarkSakura.com
133311	133631	Wow.
133871	134492	We can do that.
134572	136472	I'm a little jealous, but see, I'm not married.
136512	138713	I don't have someone to share that type of income with.
139013	141934	People say you can get a roommate and so on and so on to make it work, but I just don't.
142295	142955	It would be tough.
143015	145536	It would be tough because what happens if you can't find one?
145696	147917	That's the situation I find myself in.
147937	148997	Or if they leave.
149297	150878	Yeah, it would just be difficult.
151349	151769	Outro Music
168001	168482	Congratulations.
168522	176913	It's a good time to do it because that government program where you get eight grand back in your taxes next year, that's putting a new roof on our house.
177093	177354	Nice.
177374	178555	That'd be awesome.
178956	180758	Quick, anyone want to get married, buy a house with me?
180778	181339	No, I'm just kidding.
183395	187198	Oh my gosh, it's definitely a time to buy.
187538	194602	Now, bringing it back to video games, since that's what our show is all about, since it is now your house, are you doing anything special with the tech?
195563	204789	I don't know necessarily the games, because I know the wife is not a fan of games not called Excite Truck or Bejeweled, but I know you were talking about something tech that you're doing with the babies.
206310	211313	I was thinking it would be cool to do video monitors, because usually how you do
211906	214187	You know, like a baby monitor that's audio or something like that.
214527	224529	But they had a commercial that I saw on TV for like Home Depot or something like that where some guy was doing a project where he had video monitoring for their babies.
225069	231670	But having two of those and we can do picture-in-picture on TV while we're watching TV and stuff, you can see the two babies there.
232170	232551	I don't know.
233571	238392	That would probably be really expensive and a lot of work for something that's kind of neat.
238832	239072	But...
240578	240938	We'll see.
241518	242419	Mainly network stuff.
242439	250842	I'm going to have to run a bunch of networking stuff through our attic because I can't stretch a 50-foot Cat 5 cable anymore.
252803	256825	It's going to be interesting to see how your stories change once those babies are born.
257205	260206	I'm very curious to see what's going to change in the house of Loki.
260766	261286	We'll see.
262267	263247	Congratulations on the house.
263287	266709	I helped him move into it Saturday because that's what friends do.
266729	267929	It's a nice house.
270774	273716	It's very similar to the one I rent, but I only rent it.
273916	278899	It's, you know, with the hardwood floors and the one bathroom and three bedrooms, and the bedrooms are a little small.
278919	280280	I had to put in those floors.
282061	284282	Yeah, they're the laminate.
284482	286483	It's a particle board.
286503	288424	It's kind of like this desk.
289485	291506	More comments from chat.orangelaunchradio.com.
291526	294388	If you're listening to us on All Games Radio Live on this Sunday night, please join us.
294768	295228	Say hello.
295589	297130	Deekman says, you stream it.
297450	298070	Or too creepy.
298530	299431	I think that's a little too creepy.
300290	301911	It's gonna be boring.
302111	303811	Who would watch baby monitors on YouTube?
303831	306052	Well, I guess you'd be surprised.
307632	310893	And Toshin says, Loki, my neighbor has a video baby monitor.
311174	311854	I could get info.
313334	317736	I'm sure it's easy to do because it's just, I think it's just video.
317776	319036	You probably wouldn't do audio.
319556	325678	And so it'd basically just be running the video line through the ceiling to wherever you're gonna watch it, I guess.
326058	328139	Or they may even have it, you know, Wi-Fi.
328922	330144	Which would make things even easier.
330164	331305	They wouldn't have to run anything.
332346	335470	Deekman in chat says, Loki, get the angel care baby monitors.
335550	337032	It beeps if the baby doesn't move.
337793	339956	So advice from another parent, because I know Deekman.
340496	343760	Is that like the, was it everything's okay alarm?
343780	344041	It's all me.
345031	345712	Thanks for watching!
364065	364485	DarkSakura.com
383197	384538	Our cat did not like moving.
385058	393624	But that's pretty cool that you have, like, you know, that we've been doing this show long enough and we have such an awesome listener base that essentially the listeners are offering to babysit your children via your stream.
394084	396445	Well, I don't know.
396485	396746	That's...
399249	399729	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
422589	429471	No, I remember playing one thing I played at Sega Rally All-Stars or I don't know.
429891	433472	It's some sort of Mario Kart with Sega characters game.
434252	436513	And it was like Mario Kart with Sega characters game.
436733	440874	But no, what's weird though is they had commentators, which is odd.
441534	444655	I was not imagining commentators in that kind of game.
445307	448008	Is that the game that's supposed to have Greg Proops as the commentator?
448028	448588	No, no, no.
448648	449408	That's Mad World.
449488	450248	That's awesome.
450469	450989	Oh, that's right.
451029	452449	Okay, I was going to cut him up.
452549	455010	That would be... That's already out.
455030	455590	Sorry.
455750	457190	Why did I think that was a racing game?
457431	466193	I don't know, but hey, if they want to come back and do commentary in that game, not changing up any of the language whatsoever might actually make that game good.
466213	467053	No, I...
470089	470810	So I played that.
470850	475633	I think that was on Thursday when I was just like, eh, I don't know what I want to do.
475733	477254	So I'm going to start playing some random games.
477294	481257	I watch people play a lot of stuff, but I don't know.
481297	487421	This week I actually played more Grand Theft Auto 4 because we play that every day.
488602	489283	I played...
491661	493382	Some prototype, which is fun.
493722	498164	It's really underwhelming as far as graphics go.
498384	505986	I mean, it's very plain looking, but if you think about the developer of the game, they actually were the ones that did the Hulk, the ultimate destruction stuff.
506087	514030	It's very simple graphics, but it's the same type of gameplay where you can throw things in the stuff and just go crazy.
514890	520232	You can absorb people and take their life to boost your health and stuff like that.
520672	521272	Thanks for watching!
543214	543935	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
558874	583859	and we get into the topic we got into like a few weeks ago talking about like Saw and that whole thing where like I can't watch the Saw movies because it's too real for me but when the violence is over the top yeah this is over the top okay like I think that stuff is funny like snapping people in half and stuff like that it's just ridiculous okay like Mortal Kombat over the top always has been you can grab somebody you know and just run into the ground with them or like there was one that they had in a video where he grabs a soldier and
584179	584739	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
610165	610625	Thanks for watching!
627173	629574	Angry Barry, which is an XNA game.
629954	637057	It's basically Obama the game, the fighting, it's like a Final Fight type game.
637298	638518	It's absolutely ridiculous.
638878	643981	The problem is it's broken on Xbox community games right now.
644281	646902	You can download the game and it won't boot up at all.
647342	648943	And you waste money, which sucks.
649443	658532	But, Angry Barry... Wait, don't these things have to go through like a... Yeah, they should, and it pissed me off because it was working, so apparently he updated something and it broke it.
659112	664538	So, now I paid for this and I can't play it, and it's really making me sad because...
664918	669160	I'm actually looking at some footage of this here in studio off of YouTube.
669180	670181	It's absolutely ridiculous.
670201	674763	You can pick up... The first level, you're apparently fighting old ladies.
675403	677564	Okay, yeah, cat ladies in Central Park.
677664	681446	On the start of his quest, Barry runs into a bunch of old dotties.
681706	682327	I went off the screen.
682347	683347	Wait, let me roll back a little bit.
683687	688210	A bunch of old dotties who have a much different idea of who should rule the world.
688670	692712	As he continues, Barry is haunted by a ghost from his past who may end his quest before it starts.
694100	718173	and so basically the game's kind of funny because he runs around and he can punch things and stuff like that you punch people in the face but he can also pick up stuff like unrealistically like you know the park bench oh no it gets better it gets better he can pick up people by their heads and then he can also pick up like buses and stuff it's just let me fast forward absolutely ridiculous see there he picked up a jogger and he's like trying to smash people
718413	724440	Okay, but the caliber quality of this game looks like somewhere between NES and Super Nintendo.
724700	725501	It's awesome.
725942	728244	Somebody's running by yelling, have my baby, Barry.
732309	734491	Keep going until you get to the bus, because that's hilarious.
734511	736674	Let me fast forward a little ways here, if I can.
742298	745021	Part of me wonders if this is, like, really disrespectful.
745121	745581	I don't know.
745641	746262	There's the bus.
746582	748143	This is awesome right here.
748964	751146	Bunch of old ladies getting on the bus.
751166	752147	Old ladies and stuff.
752207	754889	And he just picks up the bus and starts smashing old ladies.
755509	756830	That's awesome.
756871	757371	Right there.
757431	758752	That was instant purchase for me.
758772	760253	I'm like, I must buy this game.
760473	761915	And I did, like, instantly.
762375	763556	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
782572	783293	if it's broken.
783713	785194	And so hopefully they'll fix it.
785514	787636	It says I purchased it and then I'll get to play it.
787936	794761	SSJ100 Matt in our chatroom, chat.orange.radio.com wants to clarify, when the fixed version comes out, you can re-download it and it will be okay.
794781	794861	Yeah.
794881	795842	You don't need to buy it again.
796242	803167	And it's AngryBerry, like B-A-R-R-Y, like Barack, not AngryBerry as in like Raspberry or Dingleberry.
803347	804628	Yes, AngryBerry.
805028	805329	All right.
805469	806609	And it looks awesome.
808491	808991	Interesting.
809011	810372	All right, anything else for your gaming week?
810833	810953	Um...
811693	812994	No, that's it for right now.
841149	843630	Besides, they have Need for Speed Shift now, if you wanted that.
843730	849792	Well, and the good news is, or, you know, the Forza series is continuing without them, and all that.
850852	859394	Anyhow... Project Gotham, I don't know if that's still... I'm sorry, yeah, Project Gotham, I don't know if that's continuing, but... I think it is.
859614	859755	Yeah.
860175	867757	Anyhow, Blur is now like a realistic racing game, but it mixes that with the types of stuff you'd see in Mario Kart.
868217	869278	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
892236	893097	All these different types of...
916317	919960	PowerUps in a Burnout-style arcade racer.
920380	927726	Not where, like, you know, pile-ups and crashing cars is encouraged like it is in Burnout, but that sort of, like, look and speed and feel to the cars to it.
928127	934111	And the way they had it set up at E3 is that they had, like, 20 Xboxes all networked together, and everybody was essentially playing the same thing.
934532	936153	And I had a lot of fun playing it.
936173	937714	I think it'll be a fun game on Xbox Live.
937974	940136	It's like Mario Kart, but more real cars.
940496	944560	So, and from what I'm understanding, they're actually licensing real cars for this game.
944620	944780	Yeah.
945040	947702	So, it's like real cars that shoot lightning.
948402	952065	So, it's a little strange, but it was actually a heck of a lot of fun to play.
952085	954426	I think I'm going to pick up the whole thing when it comes out.
954726	956087	I don't know what you're thinking, Loki.
956507	958909	I know you didn't play it, but... Oh, no, you did play it a little bit, didn't you?
958969	959129	No.
959529	959890	Oh, that's right.
959910	961391	The Xbox broke when you sat on the plate.
961411	963292	The server crashed when I tried to play it.
963312	963832	That's right.
964953	965173	I hope.
965481	966102	It looked fun.
967924	970146	Some other games I played at E3 that I wanted to point out.
971447	974450	White Knight Chronicles, I think we touched on a little bit last week.
974831	976212	I didn't play it, but I watched Loki play it.
976612	978014	Looks like a lot of fun.
978034	979375	That's a role-playing game.
979956	983419	Looks pretty intensive, and I definitely want to check that out.
983440	987444	That's a good exclusive for PlayStation 3, especially if you're the role-playing fan type.
988064	995309	Uh, because it looks like it has the huge, uh, landscapes kind of like Oblivion does, but it's more of a third-person oriented game.
995329	997091	Reminds me a lot of Final Fantasy XI.
997931	999852	Like, the landscape's very similar to that.
999892	1000073	Really?
1000093	1000653	There's zones.
1001434	1002254	Um... But not online.
1002294	1002955	This game was not online.
1002975	1003715	It's online, no.
1004216	1007017	You actually... Well, you can play online.
1007118	1010280	You can play online with a party of a few people, and then you can do that.
1010420	1011180	Or it's AI.
1011461	1012701	And the AI actually is good.
1012742	1016084	They do what they're supposed to, and they're not doing retarded things.
1016564	1017345	So, um...
1017945	1018726	That's kind of cool.
1019526	1021208	But I think it is online, too.
1021548	1022249	So that might be fun.
1022789	1031416	I don't think I ever mentioned last week that I did try out Katamari Forever, which is the new Katamari Damacy game on PlayStation 3 that takes some of the old levels and kind of repackages them.
1031676	1033598	And there are some newer levels, too.
1033638	1041264	Like, for instance, I played a level where you were rolling around the Katamari, and you would start in water, and then as you rolled around, you lost water.
1041304	1047229	Kind of like, imagine your Katamari's a giant sponge, and you're basically rolling it over dirt, and as you roll over the dirt, flowers grow.
1047669	1052190	So the idea was you tried to paint so much of the ground with flowers in the time limit.
1052510	1060973	And then there's some secret, you know, the gal that was showing off the game was showing me there's some secret areas where you can find more water so you don't have to run back every time as you lose the water.
1061493	1064274	And that's kind of the strategy to get higher scores in that level.
1064634	1066174	So there are some new things in the game.
1066234	1069255	So Katamari Forever is not just a rehashing of the old stages.
1070175	1073276	The one thing that was cool about it is that they have different art styles.
1073296	1076476	There's very unique different art styles now that you can use.
1076816	1080657	Especially this whole where it starts all in black and white.
1080977	1085258	And then as you roll over objects, those objects will be in color anywhere you see them.
1085598	1086438	Which I thought was kind of cool.
1086458	1089979	So some of these new art styles they're adding are making the game feel...
1090519	1091419	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1113987	1119351	I already had more fun playing it than I did Beautiful Katamari on the 360, which I just never got into.
1119411	1120192	I don't know what it is.
1120352	1121673	I don't know what it was about that game.
1121693	1123575	Maybe it's just the controller of all things.
1123975	1125636	I just could not get into Katamari on the 360.
1126477	1127698	But the PlayStation 3 one was fun.
1127918	1130660	They added a new game mechanic, too, where you can actually bounce.
1131181	1134624	You actually basically jump with the Katamari, which is a little unrealistic.
1134664	1139868	But hey, I mean, rolling around, rolling up entire islands in the earth is a little unrealistic, too.
1139948	1140949	You know, I don't like...
1141509	1150393	The only thing I would change about Katamari is I don't like the action that you have to do, the motion to charge up your ball to do a little dash.
1150693	1158756	I think it should just be a button press, which would make things a lot easier because it's just a pain in the ass to kind of rock it back and forth to do that.
1159284	1162887	Yeah, you know, I didn't try, actually try doing that, the dash.
1162927	1165068	I was playing too much with the jump and the whole, you know, flipping.
1165289	1171193	I like to do the, you know, you click the buttons and it flips the ball around, so you don't have to spend the whole time doing a turn.
1171293	1177818	But in the chat, Azure Edge is saying, in Japan, Katamari Forever is called Katamari Tribute.
1177838	1179019	Yeah, it's true.
1179279	1180740	It was a different name in Japan.
1180781	1182442	I believe it's already out over there, so...
1184291	1184812	It was fun.
1185072	1186372	I might pick it up.
1186572	1190414	I was under the impression, I don't know why, I thought this game was an arcade game when I first saw it.
1190454	1192374	It was a Sony download game, but it's not.
1192574	1193875	They told me it is coming out on disc.
1194495	1196616	Yeah, that's what people thought, and it is coming out on disc.
1197316	1199257	So it is a full disc game, just in case you weren't aware.
1200517	1205999	One other game I think I wanted to mention... I'm looking at my notes.
1206239	1207980	Oh, Toy Story Midway Mania.
1208200	1209941	I never mentioned this game, which is, you know...
1210481	1213542	Don't write it off as simply a child's little shoot-em game.
1213902	1217143	This is one for Disney fans, which I know some of our listeners are.
1217844	1221725	It is just like the ride that they have at Disneyland and Walt Disney World.
1222005	1223466	They opened them both up this year.
1223506	1225806	It's pretty much the same ride where you sit in the cars and go around.
1226067	1228007	However, they have added new stages.
1228027	1230968	There's a skee-ball type stage and some other little games.
1231368	1235690	Apparently, it's the whole thing where as you play more and get more points, you can unlock more mini-games.
1236090	1265096	but here's the funniest thing about it it is going to come with 3D glasses and you can play the games in 3D just like you do on the ride so I think that's kind of funny pretty cool yeah so I think this game is you know if you're a Disney fan for most people especially you really hardcore gamers you're going to look at this and go this is just another crappy Wii game with a bunch of you know little mini games but I think especially like if you have kids or you're just like a Disney fan and you have like for me it's the nostalgia of the ride and being at Disneyland that really does it for me
1265516	1266236	So, it's cool.
1266396	1267637	It's a cool little minigame collection.
1267917	1283880	The other one that I thought was kind of cool is a minigame in it that's kind of like Jenga, where these little block structures will appear, and you load this cannon with a ball, and then you kind of swing the Wiimote to throw the ball, and then depending on when and where you throw it, you're trying to knock over as many blocks as possible.
1284600	1285100	Boom blocks!
1285220	1285620	Awesome!
1285961	1286201	Is it?
1286261	1288301	Yeah, it's kind of a ripoff of that, I guess.
1288581	1289401	But I thought that was kind of fun.
1289981	1291902	So, take it or leave it.
1291922	1292202	There you go.
1292912	1294593	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1309778	1310399	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1328357	1330578	and the main rundown of stuff that happened in the week.
1330618	1333098	I'm sure you read gaming blogs, you listen to other shows.
1333538	1338080	We want to expand a little more on having roundtable discussions on a limited scope of stories.
1338460	1341461	Don't worry, we'll bring you the quick news too, close to the end of the show.
1341781	1350363	But we're going to try focusing on, in our Part A and Part B, just like maybe six stories each segment that can get a little more discussion.
1350683	1355325	So if you want to call in at any point during the show to add to the discussion, you can always give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR
1357205	1359347	or, of course, you can always send us emails and so forth.
1360008	1363612	Of course, our chat room, chat.orangelonsradio.com is always available there as well.
1364052	1367936	And then, of course, we're going to spend a little more time in studio talking about these different topics.
1368137	1369958	So let us know your feedback.
1370079	1375344	Of course, as always, mailbag at orangelonsradio.com or our Twitter, twitter.com slash OLR or...
1376865	1380447	The Facebook group, the OL Army, which we haven't really done anything with for a while.
1380467	1380927	We need to.
1381447	1383428	And yeah, so we're just going to open it up.
1383768	1387149	Less stories, more time on each story is basically what it boils down to.
1387550	1390491	So let's see what happens.
1390691	1393172	So I'll start off tonight with a news story.
1394312	1397134	That kind of confirms something we heard about a while ago.
1397154	1403179	There was a trademark about this a little while ago that spurred this whole debate I think we've had once before on the show.
1403520	1404541	But it was confirmed.
1405001	1409425	Nintendo will be launching a help feature inside of their games.
1409745	1412387	This story comes from USA Today's Game Hunter blog.
1412688	1413828	Game Hunter's blog, sorry.
1414229	1417992	And it's talking about how Miyamoto has essentially confirmed that
1418012	1419113	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1438910	1441492	Nintendo's Whole Thing in the First Place
1462046	1471828	Moving on with the story, Shigeru Miyamoto did say in the interview that there's going to be this demo play, is what they're calling it, the tentative name of this, the demo play.
1472489	1475689	Here's the quote from the article, quote, In New Super Mario Bros.
1475749	1482171	Wii, if a player is experiencing an area of difficulty, this will allow them to clear troubled areas and take over when they're ready.
1482671	1485332	And yes, we're looking into this for future games, too.
1486492	1488333	It's the easy button.
1488593	1492174	Like in the Staples commercials, you hit the button and easy, you get your way through it.
1492754	1494335	Good thing, bad thing, Loki.
1494815	1500477	As I mentioned earlier, I know it's wrong to say this, but this is completely gay.
1500997	1505398	And the reason why... It does make me want to sleep with games of the same gender.
1505578	1505898	Exactly.
1505918	1506218	It does.
1506518	1507899	But, no, it's...
1509378	1516381	Okay, I guess it's alright if they want to put this option in to other games like Zelda or something like that.
1516541	1517261	That makes sense.
1517681	1521743	Because you're playing it demo-wise, you can learn more of the story and stuff.
1522283	1523183	New Super Mario Bros.
1523223	1526224	for the Wii, I can't imagine that has a story at all.
1526465	1531827	So, really, you're basically taking away the only element of the game, which is playing it.
1532267	1534788	And so, I don't know.
1534948	1535228	I mean...
1536505	1544568	I can't imagine these games being that difficult, and the fact is that you can actually just autopilot the whole thing seems kind of retarded to me.
1545028	1556692	And also, in the same way, people are defending it, saying, well, this will allow you to be able to make the games more hardcore, more difficult for those that want it, and those that can't handle it, well, they can push the easy button.
1557412	1560153	But at the same time, why can't they just balance it?
1560973	1567315	Put the effort into balancing the game so that you have it for the easy players and for the more experienced players.
1567935	1569256	Oh, I know, like, you know, effort.
1570376	1572257	No, let's just autopilot the whole thing.
1572297	1573097	That's even better.
1573537	1574958	Okay, but what about the argument?
1574978	1578459	And this is the first thing I think of, too, and I see AlphaCananagram going to it in chat.
1578679	1579239	Don't use it.
1579659	1580199	You don't like it?
1580400	1580880	Don't use it.
1581340	1582060	I don't care.
1582240	1584321	It's just insulting that it's there in the first place.
1585447	1590529	I mean, because really, the message that comes across with that is not that, oh, we're trying to help players.
1590809	1598433	You know, maybe like Devil May Cry or something like that, or a game that's been notably insanely hard all the time.
1599013	1604055	Maybe something like an easy mode for that or something, but not necessarily something that just plays the game for yourself.
1606371	1623134	I don't know, I just, I think the option, the better option should be something more approachable as far as like an easier, you know, gameplay option or something like that, an easier difficulty so that those people, you know, you can take those portions of the game that are going to be frustrating out of it or make them easier on this new difficulty.
1624195	1627655	I'm supposed to give you a slap on the wrist for calling it gay, by the way, from the chatters.
1628195	1629096	Whatever, you know.
1630076	1631076	Obviously he doesn't mean...
1631764	1631864	No.
1631904	1631964	No.
1657372	1660154	It's not even really entirely Nintendo's fault.
1660734	1666738	I put blame on society for this too because nowadays it's not about winning and losing.
1666818	1670480	It's about everybody participating and everybody's a winner because they've participated.
1671680	1673762	That's great, except you're not participating.
1673822	1676523	You're just pushing a button and the game's doing it all for yourself.
1676863	1680886	So now that you've seen the end of the game, what's really going to entice you to go through it?
1681166	1682266	I mean, on your own.
1682667	1683027	It's not...
1683795	1689343	And it really just, you know, sends home the message that Nintendo doesn't really give a crap about the core game.
1689383	1697775	I mean, they do in a certain sense, but at the same time, it really, their console is for the younger audience and, well, we're making a few games for you as well.
1698344	1704850	Let me read some comments from chat, and if you have a thought on this too, give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR Is this making games too easy?
1704930	1705610	What's going on?
1706091	1718380	Some other comments from chat here, and this is one I agree with, is that GoldAnthro in chat says You will have the temptation to use it, that's the problem And for me, that might make me a little nervous too, but let's go to the phones, we have a call Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?
1721083	1722544	Hello, you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?
1726269	1730313	And wouldn't you know, the first call we take, it doesn't work.
1730573	1731614	Didn't use the easy button.
1732014	1732474	That's right.
1732494	1733896	Your call needs to be automated.
1733916	1735737	Can I please pause the show and hit the button?
1736138	1736578	No, all right.
1737779	1738159	Here's the thing.
1738299	1744204	I'm also surprised that this was not launched in the Zelda type of game.
1744405	1745966	And I kind of get it for that.
1746506	1749429	But I kind of agree with what GameGuru was saying in chat.
1749489	1750530	It's a Super Mario Bros.
1750570	1750730	game.
1750770	1752512	If you can't play, you may as well give up gaming.
1753322	1755026	GoldAnthro Is this making games too easy?
1764628	1769710	I think it is, because people say don't use it if you don't want to.
1771030	1772470	If you don't want to use it, don't use it.
1773011	1782533	But there's that temptation that people will use it, because it is there.
1783513	1785314	If there's no reward for not using it...
1787085	1789226	I'm sorry, I got my family yelling at me.
1789626	1790206	You know what I mean.
1790226	1791586	There's going to be that temptation.
1792126	1792667	No, that's okay.
1793887	1796148	That's kind of where I feel, too, is that it gives that temptation.
1796188	1797868	But I'm trying to look at both sides of this.
1797908	1798888	I really am.
1798928	1804890	The Wii is that family-friendly, even your... I'm going to let you go, Goldanthro, but thanks for the feedback.
1805650	1806491	Is that very...
1808806	1813809	Wii's got that very family-friendly, soccer mom, let the seven-year-old play, image to preserve.
1814929	1817991	A feature like this kind of makes sense for a system like that.
1818632	1819452	I don't think it does.
1823094	1831339	The problem with Nintendo and a lot of the game publishers and a lot of the companies out there that are producing consoles is this.
1832330	1843352	They're making the consoles and the games more approachable to people that don't play games, but people are still not biting on them, and so they're like, why are they not?
1843712	1844492	Let me take another call.
1844532	1845532	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
1845572	1845952	Who's this?
1846953	1847733	Hi, it's Sterlok.
1847893	1848553	Hi, Sterlok.
1848853	1852474	What do you think about this whole Nintendo easy mode, or what they're calling it, demo mode?
1852534	1853794	Is this a good idea, bad idea?
1855354	1856294	I think it's a great idea.
1858015	1859315	I'm blind, and...
1861109	1875403	This would be awesome for something like Zelda because I just like to walk around and just dick around and if I want to get further, it's really easy to just turn this thing on and
1877825	1879466	I think it's a great idea.
1880706	1885987	You're saying that you're blind and that you have problems with certain other games.
1886007	1889468	Do you find Zelda to be too hard the way it is now?
1890408	1894750	You probably learned to deal with that as you're playing with the video games, right?
1895810	1899371	Yeah, since I'm totally blind, I just play with sound.
1899591	1899771	Right.
1900649	1903872	Are you the same one that sent us emails before on some of these subjects?
1903912	1903972	Yes.
1903992	1904872	About some of the music games?
1904912	1905733	Okay, yeah, I remember you.
1906294	1910277	I guess here's kind of my thought.
1910497	1917503	That's a very good thing I wouldn't have thought of before, is that maybe it makes some of these games more handicap accessible, certainly, if there's something that's a little too difficult.
1917923	1922386	But, I mean, you've kind of come all this time gaming with that.
1922607	1925109	So why now for this?
1926782	1930624	Well, the main thing for me is progressing in the game itself.
1930825	1934227	That's the big thing for me why I think this is such a good idea.
1934247	1944755	If I want to get further in these games other than just walking around and just doing a bunch of nothing, I would have to get someone else to basically do it for me.
1945356	1950259	Sterlok, have you had games, a lot of games, where you hit that brick wall?
1952701	1953682	Yeah, because that's
1954571	1972759	I'm big into RPGs, so basically I'm sort of restricted to just walking around and fighting around the bells, which I like, but if I want to progress in the story, not a whole lot I can do about that.
1973880	1980963	Well, Sterluck, I really appreciate the insight and giving us another angle we may not have thought of otherwise, so thank you very much, Sterluck, and you have a good one.
1981423	1981643	You too.
1983376	1984756	Definitely something I wouldn't have thought of before.
1985117	1989118	What about folks who might have something where they can't?
1989758	1995900	But maybe this speaks to a greater thing about making games more handicap accessible to begin with, and maybe this just isn't the way to do it.
1995980	1996340	I don't know.
1997060	1999221	Then that's the case in How Noble of Nintendo.
1999501	2001202	However, I don't think that's why they're doing it.
2002102	2002582	I would agree.
2003282	2007364	It comes down to their... It's a perk for folks, but it's not the reason.
2007464	2007964	It's okay.
2008004	2009244	We've made the games easier.
2009264	2011945	We've made the system that's more approachable for gamers...
2012165	2012785	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2032332	2055907	in case they get stuck that's great but you know what getting that knowledge of that feature out there to a consumer that's not playing games I mean I'm pretty sure they're probably not up to date on everything that's coming into you know a certain game they're probably not gonna know about it anyways and it's really just a kind of a waste of time because I don't think it's really going to accomplish what they're hoping that it will accomplish
2056155	2058957	Let me read a few more things from chat and then we'll move on with some more stories tonight.
2059017	2060859	But I wanted to read some of these comments.
2061499	2066883	Azure Edge in chat says, I thought all of this was just when you pause, a movie comes up showing you how to do it.
2067143	2069305	But when you resume the game, you start off where you were at.
2069525	2071627	And perhaps that was in the original trademark.
2072047	2073448	I would have no problems with that.
2073508	2074069	That's fine.
2074129	2078272	If they're giving you tips on how to play the game, then yeah, that seems very fair.
2078292	2082255	Because that way they're helping you along, but you actually have to do it.
2082415	2083336	And I do encourage that.
2083456	2084456	This is Spazinator.
2084516	2084957	A bad idea.
2085097	2086437	For a couple of reasons.
2111337	2122967	Now, first being, although Nintendo's not coming out and directly seeing it, they're kind of implying that gamers are stupid.
2124068	2130153	They have to handle gamers to get them to finish the game.
2131174	2135878	And you've got to remember, at least back in the original NES days,
2137734	2140336	And, you know, a lot of people take, uh,
2163550	2169376	pride in the fact that they play these really difficult games and end up beating them.
2170056	2177764	I mean, for me, I feel that if a game is too easy, you tend to lose interest in it.
2178678	2180219	Thank you very much, Spazinator, for the input.
2180239	2182661	We're going to talk about this a little bit, but I'm going to go ahead and let you go for now.
2183262	2184303	We move on to other topics.
2186565	2193190	Some of what Spazinator is saying, he kind of compares to the older games, and a lot of people are very fond of those games.
2193531	2199015	And I think when I think about this easy mode, yeah, it's making games more accessible to seven-year-olds and ten-year-olds.
2199296	2204100	But then I think back, okay, well, when I was ten years old, I was busting my way through Kid Icarus, which was one of the hardest games ever.
2204500	2204961	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2223294	2240472	The games out here now, if you're going to put out a lot of games that you're trying to make accessible for a 7 year old and they're really super duper easy, yeah, you may get them interested in playing games and they may think that they're all awesome because they're able to finish these games, but at the same time, is that really making the 7 year old a better gamer?
2240672	2243515	I mean, later on down the line, are they going to be any better, you know,
2244065	2244565	Thanks for watching!
2266711	2268973	Alright, one more chat comment, then we'll move on to the next story.
2269273	2272716	Deekman in chat says, Also, I would probably use it when playing Zelda.
2273057	2276359	I love the series and the plot of the games, but just can't seem to focus.
2276720	2281704	But if I can progress quickly without breaking the flow of the story, then please hook me up.
2282264	2286448	This could be an interesting perspective, and this is, you know, again...
2287508	2290210	Where I almost support this feature in games like Zelda.
2290230	2294212	I'm not sure how I feel about it in like a Mario game, but an adventure game like Zelda.
2294792	2296313	Jury's still out for me on this whole thing.
2296513	2297434	I can be swayed either way.
2297474	2298374	I need to see it in action.
2298694	2300475	But for the Zelda games, I kind of sympathize.
2300875	2306278	I am such a short attention span gamer sometimes that sometimes I don't want the challenge.
2306739	2307879	I want that story.
2308279	2309700	I want to watch the whole thing unfold.
2309720	2315583	Do you know how many games sit on my shelf that I haven't beat because I quickly move from one game to the next?
2316064	2316244	Like...
2316744	2317104	I don't know.
2317144	2320165	I wish there almost sometimes there was a way I could just go back and finish them all.
2320905	2321345	But I don't know.
2321425	2323526	And that's great, but I don't think New Super Mario Bros.
2323746	2324746	has a story.
2324886	2326046	I'm pretty sure it doesn't.
2326386	2327587	So there's really no point.
2328127	2335449	And on top of that, stop trying to develop technology to demo actual games and give us stupid demos for God's sake.
2335809	2336229	Seriously.
2337321	2337761	Thanks for watching!
2358871	2359411	Thanks for watching!
2379324	2408515	I don't want to do another maze I want to get to a save point I want to go eat a burger because that's just where I was at that point so you know what I loaded up Final Fantasy Wikia and there was a whole little map on how to get through that room and I just did it and I was like yay that's fine that's okay but see you're not relying on I mean to get you through a certain point and it's just helping you out it's not saying okay you know you need to do this or you know here let me do this for you it's just saying you know here's what you need to do go do it
2409460	2409660	All right.
2409680	2410080	And that's fine.
2410120	2414042	That's just like saying, you know, hey, Rob, I'm stuck in the Zelda game.
2414122	2415342	You've gotten past this point.
2415702	2416603	What am I supposed to do?
2417223	2421064	It's just like that, and there's no harm in that because you're still having to do it.
2421304	2422325	It's just giving you a tip.
2422625	2426787	How often do you – I know, like, many years ago, like in high school and stuff, how often did you do that?
2426807	2427827	Like, your friend would be playing the game.
2427867	2428767	I can't get past this part.
2428807	2429387	Give me the controller.
2429407	2430148	Okay, there you go.
2430168	2430488	Exactly.
2430548	2433489	Why isn't Nintendo just bringing back the Nintendo tip line?
2433549	2435290	I mean, they can make more money that way.
2435370	2436810	Get some game counselors on staff.
2436830	2437310	There you go.
2437330	2437631	All right.
2437651	2438551	Let's move on with some more news.
2438982	2442744	DJ Hero Turntable Support for Future Guitar Hero Games
2468965	2474029	So maybe later on, you know, they can add DJ support as well.
2475069	2478092	They said they would have liked to have worked it into Guitar Hero 5.
2478432	2481474	Unfortunately, Guitar Hero 5 ships in a few months.
2482295	2486337	And, you know, it's a few months before the DJ Hero thing comes out.
2487018	2489440	So maybe later on they'll add it in there.
2489820	2491501	But it sounds like a great idea.
2491521	2492542	Yeah.
2494190	2496191	I don't think it's a great idea.
2496291	2500174	I don't think they're going to do it, but it sounds like a cool idea.
2500254	2507058	I think if anything, if they're going to have that type of stuff, it's just going to be maybe tracks that you can download on DJ Hero.
2507078	2509980	They'll have the guitar and DJ Element in there.
2510160	2515225	And if you have an opinion on this or any other story we're going through tonight, 1-877-GAME-OLR is the number to call.
2515325	2517647	Or our chat room is chat.orangeloungeradio.com.
2518107	2521250	But, you know, this makes me think about I was playing rock band this weekend.
2521270	2521951	You know, you were over.
2522011	2523352	We were checking out rock band.
2523793	2531560	And, you know, I don't have room for a turntable on top of all the other crap that rock band, you know, rock band, guitar hero, whatever.
2531600	2532821	Same thing these days, right?
2533121	2534242	Well, not really.
2534282	2535784	But same peripherals these days, right?
2535804	2535924	Yeah.
2536104	2536684	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2556701	2558202	DJ Hero Mixing Music Together
2583334	2583834	Thanks for watching!
2600694	2608437	I don't know, it'd be a lot of support for a game that they could just add more support to the existing DJ games to just get people to buy that instead.
2608457	2611178	And there's no real point to have to support it anyway.
2611258	2613879	You know, I still say you're going to be so limited with this, though.
2613939	2621562	You know, I don't... Okay, on my Rock Band, I have Rock Band 2, Rock Band 1, and I've got to have at least 40 to 50 download songs.
2621682	2623763	I mean, I have a lot of download songs.
2624143	2626444	I've given that company a lot of money, but they've earned it.
2626584	2628225	You know, a lot of fun nights there with Rock Band.
2629585	2639649	I, sometimes, you know, when I have friends come over to play the game, they get up ready to sing, they scroll through the list and scroll and scroll and scroll and go, I can't really sing any of these songs.
2639910	2648133	You know, like there's, sometimes, and I don't know how you guys do it when you play rock band, but I know that we let the singer always pick the song because they probably get the hardest role.
2648553	2657157	You know, guitar is pretty much the same and drums are pretty much the same and I assume turntable would be pretty much the same no matter what song you're choosing, but it's always up to the vocalist.
2657577	2664201	And again, how much variety are you going to get if there's only like 10 songs that are going to support the turntable and all this?
2664581	2670004	It seems like, while it's a nice enhancement, it seems like effort that could be better spent somewhere else.
2670024	2673126	And the only thing I could see, here would be a good idea.
2673767	2676928	You would take like a game, I don't think Guitar Hero is the right game for it.
2676968	2684493	I think Band Hero would be the right game for it because Band Hero is going to be more pop music that has a lot more turntable stuff in it.
2685202	2686982	Wait, there's actually a separate game called Band Hero?
2687022	2687542	Yes, there is.
2687682	2691223	It's basically like Lego Rock Band, because Lego Rock Band's going to be more pop music.
2691463	2694384	They had a demo, or they had a trailer for it at E3.
2695084	2696384	I know, I remember seeing that trailer.
2696484	2698425	I thought... I don't know why.
2698465	2700185	Okay, call me stupid, laugh at me, I don't care.
2700545	2703266	But I thought that was kind of like Guitar Hero 5's name.
2703386	2704326	I thought it was the same thing.
2704706	2710867	I thought they were just finally admitting, oh, hey, Guitar Hero's not really a guitar game anymore, so they're calling it Band... I thought it was Guitar Hero 5 Band.
2711067	2717973	Band Hero now is basically the pop, easy, family-friendly game or whatever.
2718494	2720515	And they're going to have bundles and fun stuff for that.
2720856	2728723	But I think that would be more appropriate for Band Hero because then you could, say, have a download thing that adds DJ support in if you have DJ Hero.
2728983	2730384	Or, hey, if you want to...
2731545	2732946	Be interesting with it, I guess.
2733147	2742354	And since they don't really sell the instruments by themselves at the turntables, maybe if you have a DJ Hero save file or something like that, it detects it and it'll allow you to play those games.
2742775	2753064	Or maybe if you have, say, songs available, like download content or something that's Guitar Hero and DJs that you can play in Band Hero.
2753404	2754165	Let me go to the phones.
2754185	2756106	We have a call here on our Skype line.
2756166	2757347	Hi, you're on Orange Sounds Radio.
2757367	2757768	Who's this?
2758578	2759499	Hey, it's Dan Shadow.
2759639	2760379	Hey, Dan Shadow.
2760399	2765043	What do you think of this whole thing, the turntables in Guitar Hero and Band Hero and all this?
2766564	2769827	Um, I wasn't really what I called, but I just wanted to try.
2770487	2778333	Isn't it the new Guitar Hero game, or was it Rock Band, Beatles, that lets you play multiple instruments in replacement of other instruments?
2778554	2779594	That's Guitar Hero 5.
2780735	2786800	Yeah, because you just mentioned the lead singer always rolls through whatever song they want and then
2787523	2793512	you know, like bass, and then no one wants to sing, and that's the, I just think good thing.
2795549	2798131	The call is cutting in a little in and out.
2798151	2809541	I think we have the bad connection, but I kind of get the point there that Guitar Hero 5 is kind of letting us do this more enhanced band thing where if nobody wants to sing, then great, we'll have two people play guitar.
2809961	2811082	Of course, that's more peripherals.
2811602	2814244	But hey, at this point, you probably have enough.
2814264	2815726	Yeah, tons of people own them at this point.
2815746	2818488	You probably have enough, and hell, friends bring them over.
2818528	2820109	I guess that's probably not going to be the problem.
2820529	2823452	I can't see four drummers, but sure, why not?
2824187	2831619	Yeah, I just wanted to chime in and say that's the biggest problem I have when I play rock band is that everyone wants to play one song, the singer doesn't want to play this song or whatever.
2832440	2834684	Well, that's what I wanted to chime in on.
2834724	2835085	Go ahead and
2835629	2838170	Keep on with your DJ conversation.
2838270	2839910	No worries.
2840010	2841851	We are experimenting with a new format tonight.
2841891	2844552	Letting the callers call in while we are talking about stories.
2844952	2848613	It's perfectly okay if folks want to go back a few steps within the story.
2848653	2851914	As long as somebody doesn't call in to say, Hey, I want to talk about Doom.
2853914	2857015	We will have a space at the end of the show for folks that want to call in on any topic.
2858335	2859196	Thank you very much, Dan.
2859396	2859796	Have a good night.
2860636	2861136	Have a good one guys.
2889608	2890389	Thanks for watching!
2913874	2915175	All right, TigerClaw in our chat.
2915235	2917697	Chat.OrangeLaunchRadio.com is saying quite a bit about this.
2918417	2928363	Very curious about what the Armin Van Buren DJ game is going to be like, which was oddly silent at E3, as was Scratch, although now we're starting to see videos of Scratch be released this week and more.
2928644	2929604	I've already seen them.
2929944	2930545	Very interesting.
2930905	2932607	I think a violin in a music game would be awesome.
2952985	2956926	But when I read that, isn't that more going the other way?
2957226	2960527	Putting guitars in DJ Hero, which they're already talking about doing?
2960707	2962547	Yes, and they are.
2963488	2966468	I think that's a cool idea as well, but it's kind of the other way.
2966548	2969849	It's putting guitars in DJ Hero because you're saying you're adding guitars.
2971209	2974850	But, to be fair, a very interesting line that's being blurred.
2975050	2977591	Would it be interesting if some of these songs were in both tracks?
2978359	2978840	You know what I mean?
2996914	3000976	Not something I think they're going to do this time around, but it will be cool in the future.
3001277	3007040	And I mean, sure, we're spending $120 on this game and a controller, so I'd hope I'd be able to use it in as many things as possible.
3007821	3011463	We have the TimeDilationDude in chat says, again, we need more cowbell.
3012023	3012403	That's true.
3012423	3014044	When are we just going to get cowbell in these games?
3014064	3014845	That's what we're waiting for.
3014885	3018647	Don't they have that like in... Wii Music has cowbell.
3018667	3022169	No, well, cowbell and that, but like in rock bands and stuff like that where you can play the cymbals.
3022469	3023030	Tambourine.
3023090	3023770	It's tambourine.
3024050	3025351	Sometimes it's a cowbell noise.
3025831	3026032	Yeah.
3026152	3026312	Yeah.
3027653	3032116	But yeah, they should actually have Cowl Kay Lefster in our chatroom asks, is DJ Hero really going to work?
3032576	3053111	Yeah, I mean, it looks... I think it's going to be fun I think it's going to be a fun game too, and it looks a lot of fun from the previews I already got my order in Yeah, I mean, good thing because... I'll get them both I'm all about Rock Band When it comes down to Rock Band versus Guitar Hero, right now I am totally in the Rock Band camp I think it's the superior game But, good thing for Activision, I'm highly interested by DJ Hero I think it could be a good thing
3053511	3076268	and that has nothing to do with my prior obsession about Beatmania 2DX if you're still saying wait for the reviews when the reviews come in on this game if you see reviewers comparing DJ Hero to Beatmania 2DX they are morons the games look completely different unless granted they quantify it with what makes them very different because the games are very different
3076548	3080639	If you want a game that's like beat me in 2DX, you're going to play Scratch.
3081361	3083246	It's 2DX with better scratching.
3083366	3084189	That's all it really is.
3085427	3086308	That's the kind of thing.
3086368	3096015	I want to play both because DJ Hero is more about mixing music together, which I like doing, and Scratch is more about scratching.
3096155	3105081	It's really got the ability to do different techniques and stuff in there and really kind of make the songs your own instead of just kind of following note charts and stuff like that.
3105101	3105221	Yeah.
3106727	3111129	Yeah, in the end, Scratch is basically 2DX with better scratching.
3111549	3114430	And DJ Dark Knight in chat says, G4 will, just you watch.
3114490	3115130	Oh, I have no doubt.
3115190	3117131	That's especially who I'm targeting that statement as.
3117471	3131776	So if you're the person that writes the reviews that Morgan and Adam or whatever their names are read on Xplay, do not make that mistake like they did when they reviewed Beatmania on the PlayStation 2 a couple years ago saying it ripped off Guitar Hero.
3133237	3134397	Beatmania's been around since 1997?
3138288	3140510	Guitar Hero has been around since 2005 or 2005.
3160789	3163591	Just because she's a pretty face to look at.
3164552	3166453	Remember, G4 is not a gaming network.
3166814	3167414	Not anymore.
3167474	3169976	They haven't been for quite some time.
3170456	3175080	They are a network that caters to boys that have some gaming-related shows.
3175260	3178002	They make a big presence at E3.
3178042	3182646	They have their booth and they run around and act goofy.
3182686	3186428	Sadly enough, I think Spike covers games better than G4.
3186448	3186669	Yeah.
3187429	3190292	Well, because Spike is for big boys and G4 is for little boys.
3190532	3192394	It's not the way it's supposed to break down.
3192454	3195476	And boys who like reality TV, like cops and cheaters.
3195557	3197338	Not little boys, but you know what I mean?
3197398	3200501	It's more for the teen and 21-ish audience.
3200541	3201022	You know what I mean?
3201782	3204385	It's G4 is for frat dudes.
3204825	3205826	That's what G4 is for.
3205846	3207748	G4 doesn't really know what kind of a network it is.
3207788	3211251	It's just experimenting to see what sticks is really what it is.
3211451	3213654	Now, Deakman says the E3 coverage is pretty good.
3213934	3217058	And I do know people that will watch G4's E3 coverage.
3217339	3222265	You know, and to be fair, they are like the only network that's making a 24-7 practically presence at E3.
3222665	3229194	So I would actually almost agree they probably do cover E3 better than anyone because they devote so much time to it, you know?
3233420	3235561	Xenocor in chat wants to clarify something, by the way.
3235601	3236362	It's Olivia Munn.
3236422	3238863	I don't know how we got on the G4 tangent, but it needs to stop.
3238964	3240004	No, that's all right.
3240024	3240905	There's one last comment.
3241225	3244548	Xenocor in chat says, it's Olivia Munn, and she's not posing nude.
3244628	3247650	Half the otaku geeks in the world are going to experience nerd rage.
3249079	3252462	Guitar Hero Van Halen Guitar Hero Van Halen Guitar Hero Van Halen
3271095	3278818	The thing about Guitar Hero Van Halen is just that when I watch it, and you could watch it at E3 if you knew where to look, at Sony's booth as opposed to Activision's.
3279438	3284820	When you watch it, you can hear the cash cow mooing when you're watching the game.
3284840	3287241	It's re-skinned Guitar Hero Metallica, that's all it is.
3287421	3289342	and some more stories about this game
3318222	3318522	I don't know.
3318542	3321644	They had some decent songs with the other lead singers.
3321964	3327068	It kind of also makes you go, okay, well, how long was David Lee Roth really with them?
3327589	3330311	So where are they going to get all their songs from?
3330851	3340238	And sure enough, if you start to kind of look at the song list, while if you were a fan of Van Halen back in the 80s and David Lee Roth was around...
3340938	3341739	You're going to be happy.
3343680	3348602	There's a lot of room for those that have been following Van Halen later on.
3349102	3350203	I think the game could improve.
3351043	3354425	And yes, this is Marissa in chat says, It's Van Halen, not Van Hagar.
3355245	3360448	And that, by the way, is exactly what Activision was quoted saying at one point.
3360488	3362229	It's definitely Van Halen and not Van Hagar.
3364570	3365090	Interesting.
3366431	3367391	But I got to be honest.
3367431	3368652	Again, I'm just... I'm not...
3369591	3371293	Really interesting guitar hero, Van Halen.
3371613	3374776	If I was a hardcore Van Halen fan, I'd be all over this game.
3375316	3382883	You know, just like, I don't expect probably any of our listeners bought SingStar ABBA, but I did, because I like ABBA, and I'm not ashamed to admit it.
3384985	3388448	But I'm probably, you know, again, SingStar ABBA probably, what was it?
3388788	3391570	It was just really a 25-song expansion pack for SingStar.
3391590	3393712	There's not a damn thing new or special about it.
3393892	3394433	You know what I want?
3394533	3395474	They don't even pretend.
3396286	3399447	I want Guitar Hero, Huey Lewis and the News.
3402268	3403469	That's some good music there.
3404269	3405990	How about Guitar Hero Rickroll Edition?
3406010	3408431	There's really only one song to play in it.
3408791	3409911	That's what we're moments away from becoming.
3409931	3412212	Guitar Hero Kenny Loggins would be pretty cool too.
3412232	3414213	I don't know.
3414453	3414713	All right.
3415509	3416390	Well, there you go.
3418732	3421094	Guitar Hero Van Halen is not a game I'm very interested in.
3421154	3424437	I'd just settle for some download content with those artists.
3424497	3425558	I mean, that would be fine.
3426199	3428300	And that's another thing, too, with Guitar Hero.
3428461	3434946	I mean, I'm glad that they put out download content I think about every week.
3435447	3436228	I'm not really sure.
3436888	3440812	But a lot of these things could easily just be...
3442495	3442955	Thanks for watching!
3468120	3469802	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3490740	3491481	But yeah, you know.
3491521	3495625	As they said, and I, you know, this is probably even something we've covered on the show, but I'm just so out of it.
3495945	3499048	Lego Rock Band is independent of the, oh no, I remember this got brought up.
3499128	3501570	Lego Rock Band's list, you can't import it into the other games.
3501630	3502451	Nope, different publisher.
3502471	3504373	That's right, because all the, yeah, I remember this.
3504393	3505354	This came up last week.
3506755	3508516	I don't know if I'm really interested in Lego Rock Band.
3508636	3509256	I don't think I am.
3509616	3510397	Beatles Rock Band?
3510457	3511398	I'm all over that shit.
3511618	3512899	That game looked amazing.
3513159	3514920	And I'm not even a hardcore Beatles fan.
3515220	3517762	I don't even think I've ever owned a Beatles album.
3518682	3524286	Obviously, I think John Lennon was a great man, as were all the Beatles, and especially they do a lot of great humanitarian work now.
3524566	3529109	They have timeless classics, and you hear the songs, they're just so embedded in our culture.
3529569	3530850	You can't help but not know.
3530890	3534933	But the game just looked like, wow, this is not just a cheap reskinning.
3535473	3545298	Somebody really sat down at a table and thought, okay, how do we make... Like, not just how do we slap the Beatles in this game, but how do we make a game about the Beatles in this franchise?
3545639	3547039	That's what really kind of made that game special.
3547059	3547520	It's effort.
3547580	3548560	It's the level of effort.
3548620	3552762	It's not just, okay, we took out Metallica, put in Van Halen, done.
3552982	3556244	Whereas I think Lego Rock Band was, okay, let's just slap Legos in Rock Band.
3556524	3556704	Yes.
3556765	3557545	Make it a family-friendly franchise.
3557565	3561907	That is about as much effort as, you know, the guitar hero Van Halen.
3561947	3563128	But, you know, I'll give it to them because...
3563648	3564629	That's one game.
3564909	3579655	That's not like Guitar Hero Metallica, Guitar Hero Smash Hits, Guitar Hero Van Halen, Guitar Hero 5, Guitar Hero Band Hero, Guitar Hero Aerosmith, Guitar Hero for the DS, which just came out, On Tour 3, Guitar Hero, which will probably have an On Tour 4 by the time we get to November.
3588507	3590227	It's just, it's too much.
3591008	3592268	Too much in one year.
3592308	3594248	I mean, God, space this stuff out.
3594408	3595749	Add it as download content.
3596049	3601410	Thank you for allowing the World Tour downloads to be available in Guitar Hero 5.
3601730	3610592	Unfortunately, you can't import the whole Guitar Hero World Tour song list into Guitar Hero 5 like you can with Rock Band 1 and Rock Band 2.
3610692	3611612	And assuming...
3612492	3619457	That all stays the same, Rock Band 3, which you just build one continuous big song list, which I think is a great idea.
3619477	3621278	Do you think we'll get Rock Band 3 next year?
3622319	3622699	Maybe.
3622940	3630185	I think we will get a Rock Band 3 because they're going to do three-part harmonies in Rock Band, and they may add some different stuff into it.
3630305	3630685	Who knows?
3631286	3632707	But I think there will be a new one next year.
3632767	3635509	I'm still hoping for a keyboard someday, but I know, fat chance.
3636308	3637509	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3660612	3662574	Yes, now we're going to talk about hardware.
3663114	3671020	You've probably heard a lot of game companies touting that their game has maxed out the hardware, the PS3 or the Xbox 360.
3671380	3676364	Well, according to Richard Parr, who works at Criterion...
3677285	3680747	He's basically said the proof is that you're not the best.
3682008	3684489	Basically, it means that you're out of ideas.
3684549	3687451	You always find new ways to do things.
3687611	3692975	The constraints lift, not just with a new console generation, but with every game you do.
3693155	3693875	And I agree with him.
3693915	3700399	I mean, you look at games like Crysis that maxed out all the PCs out there, basically.
3700459	3702961	Just ridiculous stuff that you throw at it because...
3703921	3710405	You have three graphics cards in there, high-end processor, all the RAM you could possibly throw at it, and it runs just kind of good.
3710865	3712366	Not great, but good.
3712686	3713246	And you know why?
3713306	3715988	It's because they didn't optimize their code for shit.
3716388	3719109	And then when Crisis Wars comes out, oh, look at that!
3719189	3723572	It's the same damn game, basically, and it runs great on all these PCs.
3723692	3724572	Wonder why that was?
3724772	3727253	Oh, it's because we actually optimized our code this time.
3727874	3731956	So really, I think that they are able to push out more, you know,
3733248	3743216	More code, just better detail, better processing power out of these games just by the effort and tricks that they learned along the way.
3743316	3752223	Learn to optimize their code, learn to optimize their engines that they run in, and just kind of figure out ways to use every bit of the console's power.
3755405	3763352	Um, you know, it's interesting because it's challenging people to kind of, you know, think within the constraints that you might already have.
3763432	3765654	You know, you've got to innovate with what you've already got.
3765954	3770718	It kind of makes me think about why do games still continue to come out for the Dreamcast and all this?
3770818	3770998	People
3771698	3773940	Because there's a big independence scene on Dreamcast.
3773980	3775581	Not necessarily because they're putting out better games.
3775881	3781265	But I think a better example would be looking at what we're seeing this year for the Wii.
3781325	3784187	Look at Red Steel 2.
3784847	3786368	Red Steel 2 looks awesome.
3786428	3788469	It runs at 60 frames per second.
3788790	3791511	The graphics are pretty great on it.
3791531	3795454	It looks like something that could probably be on a 360 or a PS3.
3795834	3797055	But they're doing it on the Wii.
3797235	3797756	And before...
3799578	3800840	No one thought that was possible.
3800940	3809108	Even with the Metroid other M, that looks like that could be easily on a 360 or something like that, at least from the videos I've seen.
3809949	3811670	Some of these other games look really good.
3811690	3815034	They're running at 60 frames per second and stuff like that on the Wii.
3815474	3819258	A big one that was, I want to say...
3821843	3826088	The Conduit is another one that pushed the engine really well on the Wii.
3826108	3827589	They said, oh yeah, we maxed it out.
3827630	3828090	But guess what?
3828110	3833076	They came out with some better games now, other games that are coming out after Conduit.
3834017	3834157	And...
3834821	3835542	They're even better.
3835802	3842006	Well, you mentioning Metroid made me think of F-Zero on the GameCube, and I love F-Zero.
3842046	3847370	I think that was just an awesome game, especially that particular one that was on the GameCube, and it looked great.
3847430	3850933	And at the time, did something that was almost unheard of on the GameCube.
3850973	3856557	It supported widescreen 480 progression, the same resolution that the Wii does.
3857018	3861521	Yet, I see so many Wii games that don't look as good as F-Zero GX did.
3861561	3867742	PlayStation 2, there was Gran Turismo 4, it supported 1080i on the PlayStation 2.
3868623	3871843	I mean, you know... Wow, I didn't even realize that.
3871863	3877425	Who's to say that these consoles, who's to say that you couldn't develop a Wii game that could support those higher resolutions?
3878065	3878905	They could do it.
3879025	3881946	I mean, hell, if a PlayStation 2 can do it, why can't the Wii?
3882006	3883246	It's got better specs in it.
3883326	3887167	Well, maybe, well, for one, the Wii has no HDMI, but I guess they do have that particular output.
3887187	3888407	It doesn't matter, they have component output.
3888667	3889087	Interesting.
3889127	3889547	I don't know.
3889787	3891428	You could do 1080p over component.
3892068	3893248	Or just do 1080i.
3893268	3896549	I don't know enough about the tech end to really know.
3896629	3898689	Is there something within the hardware that has to enable it?
3898909	3901010	It's memory bandwidth, basically.
3901050	3909511	You're limited to the video memory and the video processor for those consoles to be able to push out textures and stuff like that.
3909931	3911572	But I think maybe 720p?
3911672	3912572	Maybe that's doable.
3913226	3922409	And if you want to call us on this topic about consoles pushing their limits, do they still have a ways to go or what have you, 1-877-GAME-OLR is the number to call or chat.orangeloungeradio.com.
3922469	3933672	Or you can do better resolution, like use 720p, but maybe letterboxes down some so that it's not using as much RAM maybe, just black...
3934516	3943294	Bars on top and bottom or something like that But maybe a hybrid resolution like 540p or something weird I don't know Maybe that's possible
3944145	3969176	TigerClaw in chat says you can do 1080p over component if the TV supports it most TV won't allow 1080p over component because it doesn't support HDCP that's fine but I mean let's just do 720p then for argument's sake I mean because 720 still looks great I mean and a lot of it's interesting because a lot of these you got to be careful too there's a lot of cheap HD TVs out there they're only capable of 720 they don't even do the 1080 at all but yeah 720 is still considered HD
3972159	3974640	What's to say you can't do 720 on the Wii?
3976020	3976740	It'd be interesting.
3977201	3979201	Really, it's just forward thinking.
3979901	3982082	I don't think that they're going to do that because guess what?
3982122	3985302	They think that their audience doesn't care.
3985803	3991044	That's sad because they could do that and they could push the technology to maybe do that.
3992136	3997097	And here's, this one comment here is going to take this conversation in a different direction.
3997137	3997558	Watch this.
3998358	4001199	GameGuru in chat says, graphical power is overrated.
4001619	4004099	Yes, Wii's new AV port has four connections that aren't used.
4004119	4006900	But go back to, graphical power is overrated.
4008221	4010361	Isn't that what this is really all about in a way though?
4010441	4010641	Yeah.
4010921	4014142	Is that, do you really have to have the most cutting edge?
4014162	4017323	Do we even really need this talk about HD on the Wii and all this stuff?
4017883	4020104	Shouldn't we just have the fun game?
4020836	4023837	True, but that's also how they're getting around some of this stuff too.
4023957	4030299	Because you'll notice, like Mad World, full 3D game, ran pretty good, black and white.
4031119	4032199	That's the way they got around.
4032659	4036801	It's a different art style, so they didn't have to push the detail and stuff like that.
4037161	4041282	Red Steel 2, they're going with a comic book or maybe cel-shaded look to it.
4041922	4047784	Another way that they've gotten around having to have really detailed textures and stuff like that, you save on texture memory that way.

4107110	4108431	Thanks for watching!
4134138	4136280	But I'm very interested in the story.
4136380	4143124	Now granted, a lot of this is because I love Final Fantasy 4 and I'm very nostalgic for it, so to have the story keep going is great.
4143565	4148728	It's great though, because I mean, think about it though, if you did that with the Wii, you could actually reuse assets.
4148808	4150770	You save development time right there.
4151370	4156413	I mean, you can reuse assets, you can create new things, but you can just, you know, build upon it.
4156433	4159736	Remember Samet, what was it, Metroid Zero or whatever?
4160276	4161337	Zero Mission, I believe?
4162196	4163817	You know, basically Super Metroid.
4163877	4166998	There are some differences in there, but then there is this whole after part.
4167339	4169880	I want to read this lengthy comment from Xenocore, because I think it's a good one.
4170300	4175683	As much as this guy may have a point, this quote has merit, but only as far as what the rest of the game is doing.
4176063	4181286	This console has been maxed, if you consider what else the console is doing while it's rendering graphics.
4181826	4188710	If a game isn't as intensive in driving AI or keeping objects in memory, fighters have more room for graphics than a simulation does.
4189250	4191131	Chat.orange.com if you want to comment.
4191511	4193092	or 1877 GameOLR.
4193392	4193812	That's true.
4196713	4197634	It's all how they use it.
4198334	4199014	All the different tricks.
4199134	4200415	I like this comment from Dan Shadow.
4200615	4202756	Who cares about graphics when Scribblenauts is coming?
4205637	4206377	That's true.
4206437	4207678	Scribblenauts is going to be awesome.
4207698	4209279	How are they going to do a sequel to that game?
4209439	4209759	I don't know.
4210556	4216300	Hey, make a game like that on Xbox or something where when you put in bacon, it's real bacon.
4216480	4219162	It doesn't look like cartoony bacon, but real bacon.
4220944	4221564	Wishful thinking?
4222665	4224746	Too bad they couldn't do like a fighting game like that.
4225447	4228369	Where you're just fighting and all of a sudden you just summon different things.
4228989	4229589	You know what, though?
4229729	4237811	I gotta admit, as much as the Scribblenauts demo made me teehee when I was watching it at E3, I do remain a little skeptical about how fun it's really gonna be.
4237891	4241792	Like, the longevity is what I remain skeptical about.
4242432	4247693	You gotta remember, folks, remember, go back in the archives of this show, back to 2006, I think?
4250994	4254635	I said, Nintendogs was the best thing I played at E3.
4255015	4257136	It's going to be the most amazing game when it comes out.
4257536	4259297	It's going to be awesome.
4259417	4261878	All these things you can do is just going to be amazing.
4261918	4263618	Nintendogs is going to blow away your fucking mind.
4263658	4267460	And then when the game came out, bored now, two hours in.
4267800	4270001	It was the type of game where I'd seen it all at E3.
4271462	4273865	I haven't played Scribblenauts.
4274146	4275207	I'm not saying knocking it.
4275267	4276670	I'm just saying skeptical.
4276890	4278072	For me, Draw the Life.
4278292	4279073	Another perfect one.
4279274	4280656	Oh, I can draw my character?
4280676	4281397	That's awesome.
4282278	4284221	Did that and got bored.
4285430	4301199	same developer even but this I think will be fun if not just to show to your friends hey look at that Cthulhu just screwing around with that and hey why not they should have a game that's just like a sandbox type thing where you can just create your own scenarios do whatever
4302649	4306494	Bandit in our chatroom asks, why is the Wii $99 for God's sake?
4306874	4307755	Good question!
4310158	4313461	Or why isn't the Wii $99 for God's sake?
4313541	4315724	Because they want to make money off of every console.
4316516	4318758	Yeah, because people are still buying it when it's $250.
4318818	4320499	Why bother?
4320579	4324441	Because they think that they can, you know... I mean, look at that.
4324922	4327664	The Xbox 360 is $50 cheaper than them.
4328464	4329064	But you know what?
4329125	4335709	They're so arrogant, I guess, and confident in their system that they just say, eh, whatever.
4335889	4337110	We're not competing with anybody.
4338953	4340435	We're not part of the next gen.
4340515	4341516	Remember that quote?
4341596	4342657	They're not part of the next gen.
4342677	4343638	We're a different gen.
4343859	4347082	But no, it really comes down to because the game is still selling.
4347263	4348104	That's the reason why.
4349005	4350406	Alright, let's move on.
4350947	4352608	We have a lot of ground to cover before we get to break here.
4352768	4360135	And this next story is about the Xbox 360's Project Natal, which obviously was one of the highly talked about things at E3 this year.
4360616	4367161	The rumor going around this week is that Xbox Natal might actually be the next Microsoft console.
4368042	4375169	It might not be something that you buy to enhance with your 360, but it might actually be a whole new type of console.
4375953	4379355	DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
4396545	4397005	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4418117	4418637	XBOX 360 SLIM
4442659	4443279	Loki, what do you think?
4443560	4446962	I mean, it makes sense that they might redesign the console to be smaller.
4446982	4448683	I don't think it's going to be the next console, though.
4449183	4452665	I don't think they're going to increase the specs on it or anything, because they can't.
4452705	4456347	Because they would alienate half their audience, basically.
4457488	4462511	I do think that maybe later on, if this takes off like they think it's going to take off, then yeah, it probably will be bundled with...
4463932	4469955	All the Xbox 360 consoles as they come out will be just like a controller.
4470415	4478379	I think a lot of people are getting caught off guard with the whole we're going to treat the Natal launch like we're going to treat a console launch.
4478479	4480600	They're going to put a lot of marketing buzz behind it.
4480620	4491866	It kind of is a big thing because if it does exactly what it's showing that it's supposed to be able to do, then yeah, that is a big thing and that might get a lot of people interested and they really want to take away that market share advantage.
4492186	4499152	That the Wii has and maybe possibly capture some of these people that have never played games before because that's what kind of the Wii did.
4499232	4502515	It's like, oh my god, I can play tennis like I can play tennis.
4503096	4505097	Or I can bowl like I can really bowl.
4505378	4508820	But this is like, I can bowl and I don't need the whole controller.
4508881	4510282	I mean, I don't even need to figure that out.
4510362	4511603	I just do it.
4512571	4516094	Well, now, here's something else to consider where they're going with this.
4516555	4518456	Why has the Wii been so successful?
4518496	4521759	Because they've been catering to the soccer moms, to the family audience.
4522260	4529246	Now, there are rumors out there, and I say believe them, that Nintendo's coming out with a new Wii in 2011, Wii HD.
4529306	4532669	There's rumors about behind closed doors, showing to companies, and so on.
4532709	4533530	And I say believe them.
4534051	4536012	Nintendo's the one that's got some catching up to do.
4536693	4537534	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4563375	4564896	I think it's very interesting.
4566197	4570741	Obviously, Microsoft is not content with being number two or whatever they are right now.
4570761	4571601	I guess it's arguable.
4571661	4572842	You look at the world picture, whatever.
4573222	4573863	They're number two.
4574643	4575824	But they're not in America.
4576204	4576565	In the world.
4576945	4577365	Are they really?
4577445	4577585	Yeah.
4578086	4579307	But like Japan, they're certainly not.
4579747	4581868	Well, yeah, but that doesn't matter.
4581928	4582929	Their market share is really small.
4583009	4584110	Okay, well, whatever.
4584570	4586592	This isn't about 360 versus Sony right now.
4586632	4589354	This is about Microsoft wanting to be number one.
4590154	4609320	and they're looking at how did Nintendo do it and watch when this thing launches it's going to be launched at families again but it's going to be interesting because now they will still have that whole hardcore gamer whereas Wii is going to be going in reverse they'll already probably have the buy-in from the family audience they're going to need to get the hardcore gamers back on board
4609560	4613902	That's really going to be tough because I think Microsoft gets it though.
4613922	4616404	Because if you think about it, look at what they're showing off.
4616484	4620906	All the games that they're showing off really to their core audience that's already there.
4620946	4626790	Games that everybody that I think owns the 360... For the most part, there's going to be something that you're going to be excited about.
4627290	4631952	Now, Natal is really kind of just to gather those people that may be on the Wii and stuff.
4632012	4636495	But the Wii, everybody that owns it... I mean, granted, there's games that you're looking forward to.
4636795	4637836	But I know myself...
4639315	4654261	I'm not going to be, other than Metroid Other M, and that's kind of iffy on that one, I don't have faith in them that they're going to really put out something that's going to make me go, oh my god, this is so awesome, this is the greatest game I have ever played, type thing.
4654761	4660183	I think they're just going to keep churning this crap that's been coming out year after year.
4661638	4662159	Thanks for watching!
4678922	4679783	GameGuru in chat says,
4693939	4697441	But what I want to say to that is, who's to say where the generations are anymore?
4697921	4708706	I mean, what's interesting about what we've got with this current crop of systems is that they are entertainment devices in your living room, especially the 360 and especially PlayStation 3, especially, especially PlayStation 3.
4709347	4716470	You know, their biggest thing right now is the fact that it's a Blu-ray player and does a lot of these, you know, things right out of the living room.
4716911	4721393	You know, who's to say where the next generation is even going to begin?
4721733	4722954	Because we have yet to really...
4724054	4733000	Max out this generation in some ways, but I don't know if there's necessarily going to be a hard line that defines the next generation of gaming after this one.
4733020	4739224	I guess this is what I'm getting at, because right now the war is about enhancing this current one, which we didn't really have before.
4739605	4744088	You know, when you had a Super Nintendo, you might have the occasional peripheral to enhance it, but that's it.
4744946	4745606	XBOX 360 XBOX 360 XBOX 360
4765360	4782501	The possibilities with these new platforms So you're going to see stuff like the motion controllers Coming out from Sony and from Microsoft And you're going to see the enhancements to the console from the Wii Because it's technically not a new system It's just an enhancement like the DS and the DSi and the DS Lite
4785563	4791768	GameGuru says, admittedly, it might be the next generation with MotionPlus, Natal, and PSMote.
4792108	4796051	And I'm almost on board with you there, but change MotionPlus to Wii HD.
4797131	4797752	And there you have it.
4797852	4800434	That's why I do think Wii HD is out sooner than later.
4800734	4801655	What is this all about?
4801815	4802836	Leveling the playfield.
4803896	4806598	Xbox, Sony will now have motion control.
4807059	4808900	Wii will now have high definition.
4809661	4810141	Now it's a war.
4812835	4813519	Now it's a war.
4815698	4821921	GameGuru also says in chat, and I'm sorry to keep quoting from the same person, but just a lot of thought-provoking comments, so props to you.
4822822	4824302	However, a price drop is due by 2010.
4824882	4827524	Natal will bomb with the Family Gamer.
4827964	4829405	Xbox has its stereotype.
4829725	4830905	I couldn't disagree more.
4831306	4833707	Not necessarily that Natal will bomb with the Family Gamer.
4833807	4834327	I don't know yet.
4834487	4836988	It's too early to see until we start really seeing the games.
4837268	4841010	You can't base everything off the Milo demo and some of these limited things we saw.
4841330	4844332	But Xbox having a stereotype to overcome, they can do it.
4844932	4845733	Hell yeah, they can do it.
4846033	4847875	And I'm not trying to sound like a fanboy or anything.
4847935	4849516	I'm saying, you go back.
4849917	4854241	The nice thing about this show, being around for seven years, you go back to some of those older episodes.
4854281	4856162	My God, did we make fun of the Xbox.
4856703	4857304	Oh my God.
4857584	4858565	The Xbrick.
4858965	4860066	What a fat system.
4860106	4861107	What a useless system.
4861147	4863049	There isn't a fucking game on it I want to play.
4863309	4864490	This is a piece of shit.
4864750	4866132	Who wants to buy this console?
4866312	4867773	This is just a PC in a box.
4868073	4869735	There's not a damn thing on this worth playing.
4869755	4870015	These are
4870896	4871497	Thanks for watching!
4888425	4889326	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4915748	4916528	But see, that's the thing.
4918389	4923872	Microsoft, they're really not going to have much to overcome because they've got something for everybody.
4923912	4932197	They've got now these community games, like 1 vs. 100 and stuff like that, that's going to appeal to people that like watching game shows and stuff like that.
4932597	4937480	Hey, do you think maybe they might try marketing that to elderly people that like watching game shows?
4937520	4939681	Hey, now you can be on your favorite game show.
4940201	4943102	Wheel of Fortune, oh my god, that's going to totally be one of you.
4943222	4945404	It's not going to end with 1 vs. 100, by the way.
4945444	4946344	And here's my prediction.
4946464	4947625	I'm throwing this out here right now.
4948345	4948585	XBOX GOLD
4977117	4983662	Xbox has finally conned you into buying something like a membership to Pogo.com or one of those sites.
4984143	4987766	You know where you play the online games for cash and prizes and stuff.
4988306	4989867	And that's just the first one that popped in my mind.
4989887	4991328	But there's tons of these sites out there.
4991869	4993650	That's what the Xbox is going to be.
4995272	4999195	And they won't take half the shit that a lot of the people say when they talk about those other sites.
4999435	4999775	Watch.
5001096	5001436	Watch.
5002437	5004259	That's what's going to happen with Xbox Live Gold.
5005174	5005914	I don't know about that.
5007415	5011817	That's a prediction, not a fact, but I could definitely see that happening.
5011857	5018960	They've got a lot with their streaming and Netflix, the social networking stuff now.
5019360	5024563	You have Xbox Live Arcade, the independent games now, the community games.
5025503	5031606	Um, you know, Xbox Originals, you can download full games on there now, you can, you know, play your DVDs, all that stuff.
5031906	5034107	So it's, you know, basically an entertainment console.
5034367	5043170	Now you go to the Wii, and you can play games on it, you can send a message to your friends, that's about it.
5043450	5049093	I mean, it's really limited, I mean, you can play retro games and stuff like that, but it's really limited as far as...
5050276	5051519	The Entertainment Value.
5051539	5053665	I mean, it's really just a gaming console.
5054386	5057233	But, I mean, maybe this Wii HD will change all that.
5057273	5059760	Maybe they will hopefully fix their online network.
5060305	5062286	All right, I've got to read a couple more chats, and then we've got to move on.
5062346	5068350	Unfortunately, I think we're finding that when we allow ourselves to talk more about stories, we talk about them for like 20 minutes at a time.
5068890	5071852	We're almost an hour and a half in, and we've still got mailbags slated for this segment.
5072312	5077055	But I do want to read a couple more comments because there are great talk in chat.orange.com tonight.
5077435	5077716	SSJ100Matt says,
5085440	5086261	Yeah, wishful thinking.
5086401	5087242	Let's hope you're right.
5087482	5091405	But releasing the next new console isn't going to get the consumer to buy at this time.
5092165	5096869	And then SSJ100Mac continues in response to when I said the real war is coming.
5096929	5098510	He says, well, fuck their war.
5098750	5101312	I'm not going to fund it unless they make it worth my while.
5102013	5110740	And that's a very good retort is that these things are only as good as the games that are on it, as we've always said.
5111650	5111930	DarkSakura.com
5135082	5139828	A lot of people are willing to pay top dollar for entertainment.
5139889	5142953	Not to devalue what he's saying because I think the argument is still a valid one.
5143433	5148800	You still have to convince me that it's worth it to upgrade to a Wii HD.
5148960	5151424	The thing about Nintendo, you know what they've got in their back pocket?
5152225	5171413	Mario, Zelda, Metroid, the characters you love that's what they're holding in their back pocket and people that will buy anything that says Nintendo and all they have to do is show hey look it's Link in HD boom instant fanboy boner in sales and myself being one of them I'm in line I think a lot of us will be
5173089	5189196	Let's face it, Nintendo taught us at age 7 You love Mario, and you love Link, and you love these games And they will be with you forever I'm loving Mario a lot less lately though, I just have to say that I don't know Not buying that new Super Mario Bros.
5189236	5196820	game, sorry I'm not in it now because I don't have the friends to play with on a regular basis I can't buy new Super Mario Bros.
5196840	5201882	because I don't have enough friends That's what it boils down to So, yeah Um
5202812	5209861	EA, apparently, they've drawn some attention from...
5212031	5217596	I guess their protest, not even really a real protest, it's a fake protest.
5217976	5220559	At E3, they had protesters out front.
5220619	5221139	Did you see it?
5221500	5222160	Yeah, I saw it.
5222461	5223141	I saw the protesters.
5223161	5224302	Did you think it was real at first?
5224362	5225643	Nope, not at all.
5226664	5233711	I had a moment of hesitation because I was looking at it and I was walking by and I was thinking, you know, with the crazies in this state, I almost believe it.
5234011	5235612	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5253663	5254144	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
5267645	5272167	Yeah, and in fact, that wasn't the only person who bought that hook, line, and sinker.
5273028	5291177	Apparently, the bloggers at LA Times, who basically wrote that the protesters promoted a multimedia anti-game website, the EA reps, of course, later confirmed to the Associated Press that the whole affair was staged by a marketing agency.
5291498	5295680	It says now, apparently, game politics, they're pointing out that the stunt has angered
5296380	5298202	Many real Catholic bloggers.
5298602	5312673	Margaret Cabaniss of Inside Catholic wrote, It's been clear for a while now that the entertainment industry views Christians on the whole as priggish, thin-skinned, fun killers.
5313053	5317056	Has anybody at EA actually read The Inferno?
5319839	5321320	I'm sorry, but that's kind of funny.
5322040	5324662	Another blogger, I guess, at Catholic Video Games wrote,
5325791	5326671	Thank you for watching!
5348857	5349758	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5364834	5369017	Um, and yeah, I do have to laugh because I do see Catholics unfortunately that way.
5369257	5371018	Being Catholic myself, I, yeah.
5371298	5377642	And now I'm thinking back on the whole thing and I'm kind of like, oh my gosh, I was so stupid to even believe it for like a minute.
5377902	5381444	Because like one of those people, I swear to God, was dressed in like the Puritan outfit.
5381724	5388108	Like the fucking Salem witch trials, like out there, you know, in the fucking like churn in the butter outfit.
5388448	5389229	Burn the witch!
5389689	5390649	Burn the witch!
5390669	5392731	Well, you should know, we should... And I should, I...
5393371	5411532	but here's what I ask you guys should you be mad that they did it or should you be mad that people believed it that it actually was happening for a minute because unfortunately with some of these other things that sometimes you hear about the way and I'm not talking about you know most people are pretty normal but that you know
5412640	5412700	No.
5430894	5460314	and you know at the same time I think this whole you know stunt it didn't really do anything other than draw attention to obviously the game which is what they're hoping that it would but it's not like the protest was oh my god there's so much full frontal nudity in this game it's unbelievable and the violence and sex is just crazy you know then people like oh I gotta play this game you know like I would have been like tell me more you know just but no it's just like oh there's the devil in this game really Dante's Inferno there's
5460814	5462156	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5477796	5491082	I shouldn't even mention it because after what I just said, I wouldn't want to compare the two because there's these obvious loons that go out there and protest these funerals of people that have served for our country.
5491442	5501906	I'm not even going to say who they are because I don't want to give them attention, but they go out and protest these funerals of soldiers who died in the war saying, this is because we have fags in America.
5502526	5503187	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
5524525	5526086	Do we have anyone that wants to comment on this?
5526106	5529129	1-877-GAME-OLR Did you think it was real?
5529409	5530810	Did you buy into this for a minute?
5531090	5531631	I want to know.
5531871	5533753	Or are you Catholic and pissed off?
5533773	5539297	Do you not remember when we did a protest or we were kind of observing of a protest for Booth Babes back in 2006?
5540938	5548640	And that was all just a That was all hoax too, and that got picked up by a lot of bloggers But nobody went to the outpost, because wasn't that Scott's outpost?
5548740	5562965	Yes it was And nobody went Well that part of the plan failed, but it still got picked up I shouldn't say nobody, he had a decent crowd, but I think they were hoping for a little more Yes, part B of the plan, not exactly executed correctly, but the part A part
5564085	5564726	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5588769	5591410	I actually found it hilarious because I went to Fanime not too long ago
5617212	5619453	There were actually protesters protesting Fanime.
5619473	5624695	I'm not too sure because I was looking at them from a distance.
5624735	5628737	I guess they were protesting against hentai and all that stuff, against the anime porn.
5643376	5652422	But the really funny thing was they had a cosplayer who came as Jesus to the anime convention, and he just went out there, and it was just hilarious.
5653062	5655003	There's always somebody that's got to push the buttons.
5655063	5658405	Did the protesters respond to the man in the Jesus cosplay?
5659526	5661727	They just ignored him.
5661747	5667451	They had this other cosplayer who came out as Jesus, but as a raptor dinosaur.
5668937	5671678	It's called 4chan The house of the internet Why can't they be at E3?
5697048	5704716	Anyway, I wanted to respond to this real quick because yes, it is a little off topic, but I need to say something because obviously, you know, being gay myself, I have a whole lot to say on this.
5705417	5714126	SJ100Matt says, you know, Rob, not to get off topic, but the same churches, private organizations are running the same hate ads on the radio in New York for anti-gay marriage legislation.
5714807	5725796	So, again, this just goes back to the whole, that's why I believed it when you had the chick in the Puritan outfit there with the sign that says, you know, Dante's Inferno, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
5725996	5743549	Because when I see these ads and I hear these hate speech and stuff like that on the radio about, you know, withholding people's rights, when it's in the goddamn Constitution on the 14th Amendment, no state shall pass a law that robs people of the pursuit to life, liberty, etc., etc.
5744690	5772508	okay like when I see these ads that's what I hear in my head burn the witch burn them throw them in the river see if they float don't give them any rights it's it's it's the archaic way of thinking it's always something sorry if I'm getting a little too personal and political for you but deal you know this is you know my rights that are being affected here when have I ever shut up about that topic on the show all right anything else to say about the protests Loki
5773488	5775471	Uh, no, it was retarded looking.
5776974	5782322	I mean, the whole thing was a little silly, but I will admit, I believed it for like half a second.
5782603	5783123	I really did.
5784090	5785531	General Gradover
5811624	5814707	sent us an email wanting us to check out their podcast.
5815307	5816949	Well, I haven't checked it out yet, sadly.
5816989	5817870	I'm behind on the email.
5818250	5820152	But none2k.com.
5820192	5822454	I'm always one to support independent podcasters.
5822494	5824976	I hope that wasn't a porn ad or something in disguise.
5824996	5829700	Will somebody please check that website out and make sure it is a legitimate indie podcast for me?
5831201	5832342	I want to read this email.
5832422	5836606	This email comes to us from... I don't want to read the real name there.
5838271	5839932	I don't think there is a real name.
5840092	5843613	I will say the email says Nutman, so we'll call this person Nutman.
5845174	5847915	Loki, can you please not yell so much?
5849536	5850096	No, I can't.
5850636	5857899	I had to turn down the volume almost ten times in episode 326 because Loki was yelling so loudly it was hurting my ears.
5858059	5859540	I can't be alone in this, right?
5860200	5860520	P.S.
5860660	5862141	OLR is awesome, as is Loki.
5863188	5864749	I guess you just need to turn it down a little bit, Loki.
5864969	5865670	Well, you know, we try.
5866010	5867892	This could be a problem that we've moved studios.
5868232	5870113	We unhook and hook up the mics every week.
5870454	5874797	We do rely on the live listeners to tell us if things sound way too crazy.
5875177	5878240	So live listeners, if we are too loud, let us know, please.
5878460	5883184	We'd be happy to turn down the volume a little bit so you guys don't have to suffer so much.
5883924	5886846	But it's probably not so... I mean, Loki's yelled for seven years.
5887427	5890109	That's his thing on the show, if you haven't figured that out by now.
5890569	5891350	That's not yelling.
5891750	5892371	I don't yell.
5893422	5894303	I don't know what you're talking about.
5911997	5914598	We'll try to make sure it doesn't get out of control.
5914898	5918840	So, chatters, please feel free to speak up if Loki is getting too loud.
5920201	5920521	Let's see.
5920561	5921702	We got a lot of emails this week.
5922782	5925784	This comes to us from J-Rod.
5926504	5927284	Hey, OLR folks.
5927605	5930166	I'm writing in a comment on Left 4 Dead 2 Boycott.
5930586	5935948	I want to stand on the other side of the fence from all the opinions in the OLR studio just for argument's sake.
5936308	5939969	I'm not one of the people who are butthurt about this, but I can understand why people are pissed.
5940389	5944370	I agree that the game is coming out way too soon since the first one was just released in November.
5944790	5953613	The reason people are pissed isn't because they are spoiled, it's because they expect more from Valve with integrity compared to, say, Activision in regards to putting out sequels for a cash grab.
5954093	5954653	Thanks for watching!
5978587	5982471	to address Loki's statement on huge E3 lines for the game and how everyone is going to buy it.
5982512	5990461	That's fine and dandy, but I don't expect to hear any whining when everyone buys piles upon piles of the newest Guitar Hero and Wii Fit sports games.
5991201	5993144	Which is funny because we just whined about that earlier in the show.
5993624	5995125	Also, one more shorter point.
5995466	5999769	Everyone at the OLR studio seems to be taking a crap on Sony for their lack of content for this year.
6000130	6003313	Have you all completely missed Sony's biggest release of the year, Infamous?
6003933	6010759	I'm actually surprised to hear nobody on the show talking about it because it's a very big PS3 exclusive release put out by Sucker Punch.
6011179	6013101	PS, $250 for a PSP?
6013421	6014983	Apparently cocaine is a hell of a drug.
6015303	6018466	This email is sponsored by the Olive Garden Home with the never-ending salad and breadsticks.
6018686	6019827	Yeah, I heard about Infamous.
6020047	6021429	I'm well aware of it being out.
6021789	6028276	And unfortunately, though, I'm playing Prototype, which is almost... I mean, it's not identical, but I mean, it's the same type of gameplay right now.
6028843	6031545	And I think you didn't hear us say anything about it because the game, like, came out.
6031705	6035127	So there wasn't really a lot of, like, hoo-bub about it at E3.
6035167	6036888	It was, you know, more of... They had it there.
6037048	6041932	I think they had it there, but it was just, you know, people weren't really paying attention to that because they're like, hey, this is out next week.
6042332	6043853	Let's look at, you know, all this other stuff.
6044113	6052439	And then it seemed like, I think part of the point you were trying to make last week is that it seemed like there was this huge gap in the rest of 2009, and then we've got all this stuff that's supposed to come out in 2010.
6052479	6056021	Although it does seem like, you know, we'll be peppered with a few nice things here and there.
6056161	6057462	Yeah, I mean, Infamous looks good.
6057482	6066691	I'm planning on picking it up maybe later on, but like I mentioned earlier, I have two PlayStation 3 games, though, that have come out back in... One in November, one in...
6068217	6068697	Thank you for watching!
6087543	6089845	I don't think it's Microsoft's fault I think it's EA's fault
6107492	6107532	E.A.
6107873	6109014	would be the publisher.
6109034	6121989	At the same time, though, they're saying, oh, well, we've made enhancements to the AI, to the director, and there's stuff that we couldn't have done in Left 4 Dead 1.
6122089	6126735	And really, at the end, it's the developer deciding to do it or not.
6126835	6127416	Because they...
6129181	6129962	They don't have to.
6130202	6131943	And we're talking download content, you know.
6131963	6141710	You know, they could put out those enhancements, you know, the map packs and stuff like that for Left 4 Dead or, you know, other stuff, maybe Team Fortress 2 and stuff, maybe add, you know, sell it.
6142011	6143252	They could put that stuff out.
6143372	6146214	But, you know, if it's, you know, the fact that it's being, you know,
6147383	6147923	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
6174656	6175316	Thank you for watching!
6195000	6195721	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
6214239	6220561	And at the same time, like I mentioned before, don't you guys think you might be a little bit spoiled by them?
6220741	6225383	I mean, I think their support of the community and everything has been huge.
6225443	6227143	I mean, look at what they're doing with Team Fortress 2.
6227543	6235046	It's just like updates upon updates for this game that came out, you know, a while ago and still, you know, huge support for it.
6235806	6243570	And I think at the same time, you don't realize that, you know, yeah, they're putting a lot of support behind this, but at the same time, they need to make some money too.
6243790	6248533	And yeah, that's not an excuse, I guess, in the gamers' eyes to put out another game.
6248913	6255596	But at the same time, maybe there's something that really they can't do, or they felt, okay, this is different enough that it justifies its own release.
6257277	6257657	I don't know.
6258098	6262860	I mean, you can't just have everything be exactly the same all the time.
6263240	6264501	Things have to change, so...
6266348	6269109	I guess, you know, if you don't like it, don't buy it.
6269609	6270389	And then, you know what?
6270829	6274790	If the sales suck on it, then you'll learn, okay, maybe we can't do this.
6275030	6276951	If that's really, you know, a money grab.
6279391	6285873	Uh, yeah, we have some comments on chat, and, uh, you know, again, it seems to be that most people are saying, Actdeft says, bah, cry more.
6285953	6288193	That's my opinion on the Left 4 Dead 2 boycott.
6288794	6293895	GameGuru says, I'm willing to give Left 4 Dead 2 the benefit of the doubt, because it means Left 4 Dead 1 will be cheaper.
6296971	6297353	There you go.
6299813	6300093	I don't know.
6300113	6303295	I guess we'll see a little more when this game actually is released.
6303515	6306958	I think that's when I have to reserve my ultimate judgment for is when the game's released.
6307378	6310040	If it stinks then, then I'll be right there in line with you guys.
6310060	6317665	And if they try to push out Left 4 Dead 3 in 2010, if Left 4 Dead 2 stinks, I will openly mock it here on this program.
6317725	6321247	I mean, and just, you know, I wouldn't exactly blame Microsoft for it.
6321347	6324169	I mean, look at the company that's helping them publish these games.
6324649	6328852	They're known for putting out numerous sports games each year numerically.
6328932	6329172	I mean...
6332373	6335995	I want to read this email real quick, and this comes to us from our old buddy Rene.
6336996	6341619	I'm not going to read the whole thing because it's very, very lengthy, but I do want to read bits and pieces of it and give this game a little shout-out here.
6342119	6343220	Greetings, OLR peoples.
6343601	6349044	Rene here, and I just got into the free limited beta for Ion Online that happened for the weekend of June 7th.
6349384	6355188	I'm trying the game out because Warcraft has become the doldrums and also because it's become my best friend's next fangasm until Final Fantasy XIV.
6356329	6356949	Thanks for watching!
6376516	6377077	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6399338	6400618	Something WoW neglects.
6401018	6405059	If you're in a high traffic area and it's really bogging your system down, it's no problem.
6405459	6408960	Press a keyboard combination and all other player models will disappear.
6410500	6413381	I didn't get to try out stuff like parties, alliances, emotes, etc.
6413401	6416661	There's a lot of interface elements that would need a plugin for WoW to show up.
6416701	6419502	For example, a quest tracker or a level gauge for quests.
6419762	6422682	For some reason, there's a quest to steal a bathing nymph's clothes too.
6423122	6427083	I've taken screenshots of what I've seen around the game with the game running almost everything at max settings.
6427563	6430024	No anti-aliasing, decreased shadow and water effects.
6430384	6432845	Please skim through it and post to chat if you would like.
6433345	6434866	Hopefully Aion will not disappoint.
6434946	6439308	I'm buying the limited edition and getting suckered into playing it anyway because I want to play with my best friend.
6439348	6444330	My expectations are low because WoW's PvP just left me insulted with how slow and unfair it was.
6444750	6447811	Maybe Aion will be a little closer to something resembling PSO.
6448491	6453293	Lastly, I'd like to apologize, especially to Sky, for bringing up hopes for a Mega Man Legends 3 for E3.
6453333	6453473	Sorry!
6455034	6457095	This email is brought to you by Benefiber.
6457215	6458595	Everyone needs their damn fiber.
6458655	6459796	Fuck yeah, bowel movements.
6459916	6465938	I have a question, and this is kind of E3 related, but in the whole Mega Man Legends thing.
6467118	6470659	I remember Capcom said they had two secret games that they hadn't announced yet.
6471139	6476401	One of those got leaked, and that was Tatsunoko vs. Capcom, All-Stars or whatever it was.
6476901	6477922	What the hell was the second one?
6477942	6480402	Well, hold on, because we've got a call, and I bet this caller might know.
6480642	6481543	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
6481583	6481923	Who's this?
6482642	6485804	Hey, what's up guys, it's the Rob D. Rob, we had you on hold while Loki was saying that.
6485824	6486905	Do you know what that second game is?
6487605	6489747	I think it was a Resident Evil title for the PSP.
6490147	6491368	Ah, okay, that's right.
6491388	6496371	I remember hearing that being announced, and I asked a couple people about it, and I think that's what it was.
6496631	6497211	That makes sense.
6497271	6501754	Well, Rob, we have the Skyplanes open all night tonight, so I know you're calling in to respond to something in the mailbag.
6501774	6505356	In fact, you said on chat something about this whole Left 4 Dead 2 boycott.
6505396	6506217	What are your thoughts on it?
6507096	6507856	Well, here's the thing.
6507956	6509917	I've seen a lot of different complaints.
6510217	6516799	Obviously, people love to complain about everything on forums and on podcasts and everything when it relates to the video game industry because people are passionate about it.
6516839	6517579	It's their interest.
6518079	6520000	And I've seen people defend a lot of stupid things.
6520120	6524761	I've seen people defend us getting nickel and dimed for horse armor.
6524781	6525182	And you know what?
6525242	6526202	That even brings up a lot of...
6527082	6527923	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
6551418	6552519	We flipped upside down.
6552619	6553879	Now we don't want sequels.
6553899	6559563	We don't want these companies to actually give us new engines and give us new sets of things to do.
6559623	6560723	We want expansion packs.
6561023	6562604	What has changed now?
6562924	6565426	I would give one of my good kidneys to get a sequel.
6565606	6571509	Well, certainly before this year for Street Fighter and now for a true sequel to Chrono Trigger or Marvel vs. Capcom 3.
6572950	6576131	Why are people upset that they're getting more a sequel to a game they love?
6576151	6576892	I don't get this.
6578417	6579278	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
6599966	6623339	Well, I think the argument being, and again, I don't really know the other side as well, maybe we'll get emails on it next week, but I think the argument is they feel like, because this is being put together so quickly, because the early screenshots and gameplay indicate it's basically Left 4 Dead 1 with new characters and during the day in a new setting, that this is basically like a guitar hero Van Halen of Left 4 Dead.
6624124	6627285	But we're making our judgments on a handful of trailers and a few screenshots.
6627465	6629966	And you hinted at this earlier, that this is Valve.
6630006	6631127	This is not a company.
6632027	6634628	Admittedly, I think it is published by EA, right?
6634688	6636049	Or maybe you're talking about Rock Band.
6636689	6638610	No, this is published by EA.
6639470	6639610	Yeah.
6640530	6645312	I understand that since it is published by EA, that is some cause for concern.
6645352	6645913	But you know what?
6646013	6649354	This isn't a company that has done this in the past, that is developing this game.
6651127	6652268	We should give them a little bit of trust.
6653309	6655930	Deekman in chat says they think it will break up the community.
6656050	6657852	It will split them between the two games.
6658032	6660654	I don't know if I necessarily see that so much.
6662115	6665297	We'll look at Call of Duty World at War and Call of Duty Modern Warfare.
6665717	6667839	The games that that happens to are the sports games.
6668759	6694481	that's the one where you go into EA 2010 you know whatever and then 2009 is abandoned you know but most games you still find you know pretty like case in point EverQuest 1 and EverQuest 2 granted completely different type of game because people invest a lot more time into those types of games but EverQuest 1 still has probably more of a community than EverQuest 2 so any other thoughts Rob D before we let you go and wrap up part A here
6695069	6695629	Not really.
6695709	6708593	This whole issue just ticks me off so much because, again, there's so many games that I can think of and I don't want to bash it, but there's so many games that I enjoy more that I would want sequels to and these people are complaining because they are getting a sequel to it and in good timing, too.
6708973	6710914	Well, let's just hope that the sequel's not cheap.
6711014	6717996	Let's hope that what you and I are thinking is the case and that this game will be pretty awesome with a lot of new features or else, I don't know, they may have a point.
6718916	6719756	I think they'll eat crow.
6719897	6721037	But anyway, see you guys later.
6721077	6721777	Alright, take care, Rob.
6722657	6723198	Yeah, I don't know.
6723478	6724698	I think, I don't know.
6725376	6727377	I can't tell until I play the game.
6748146	6752650	DarkSakura is on her way home, so it sounds like she'll be joining us for Part B tonight.
6752930	6757254	We'll be right back in about 5-10 minutes with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
6757274	6760377	For those of you guys listening on the podcast though, you only have to wait like 5 seconds.
6760457	6760978	Aren't you lucky?
6761238	6763540	We'll be right back with plenty more stories here on Orange Lounge Radio.
6769648	6778597	Welcome back everybody to Part B of tonight's episode number 327 taping live on allgames.com on this lovely Sunday night.
6778737	6786945	We are here, Orange Lounge Radio, myself, Loki, and making her way back into the studio, DarkSakura is here joining us for Part B tonight.
6787233	6791595	Hi, I'm just, I will be officially joining probably in about another 10, 15 minutes.
6791615	6793216	You had a PE class or something tonight, right?
6793236	6793956	Yeah, I did.
6794076	6801419	I'm taking, well, it's walking slash jogging slash running slash cardio slash whatever we want to do as long as it gets the heart rate up for 20 minutes.
6801599	6802340	That's the class.
6802980	6805741	And it's mostly online, so it's honor system, you know, pretty much.
6805901	6812364	But the test our teacher has us do now and the fact that she watches us walk our mile...
6813784	6818286	I don't think, unless someone really can fake it well, I don't think anyone's going to be able to.
6819147	6819527	Interesting.
6820307	6823409	And apparently this is her third one, and she's had a lot of success with it, so I'm pretty happy.
6823629	6824889	All right, well, that's all right.
6824969	6828211	Loki and I are going to continue to juggle the stories, but please chime in.
6828631	6832012	I know I told you before the show about the new experiment we were trying tonight.
6832052	6836034	We almost went two hours with part A, six stories, but lots of opinions out there.
6836334	6842901	Well, you know, I actually, I kind of, I was thinking about it actually while I was doing my very painful because of my shoes walk.
6844142	6847725	No, I got new walking shoes and I need insoles for them because it makes my arch hurt.
6847946	6849687	But anyway, enough fitness talk.
6850869	6853551	I actually want to get back into playing DDR.
6854372	6857215	Because I walked a 13 minute mile when I was playing DDR once a week.
6857654	6859076	I'm on DDR.
6859096	6862560	I went to Roseville Golf Land this week, the place where video games go to die.
6862640	6865824	I played that lovely, lovely Beatmania 2DX distorted machine they had.
6866264	6867806	Player 1 black keys are sticking already.
6868567	6868887	Gotta love it.
6868907	6869288	That's okay.
6869328	6869928	Right side pride.
6870914	6871374	Whatever.
6871635	6873216	Ha ha, I don't have to deal with that.
6873236	6874537	Die in a right side fire.
6874657	6875177	Burn.
6875197	6884564	Well, now that I'm not upstairs anymore in my apartment, my DDR hard pads, as soon as I figure out how to ground them from the static electricity buildup.
6884684	6889048	Let's not revive the DDR discussion from last week because I'll just get really sad.
6889828	6890549	The whole thing.
6891349	6892890	My pads actually started falling apart.
6892910	6894530	Now you're going to have to mod them for eight arrows.
6894991	6896411	Remember, that's what we're getting in the PlayStation.
6896431	6897732	No, I'm sorry, that's not real DDR.
6898192	6900113	I don't buy this Konami bullshit.
6900333	6901293	No, we can't think of anything.
6901333	6902514	Let's add more arrows.
6902614	6903374	I'm more curious.
6903394	6904294	Wait, hold on about DDR.
6904334	6908136	I'm more curious what Jamie was thinking on her walk because it was about the show and the whole thing.
6909236	6918100	Well, no, I was just thinking about what it was going to be like and it actually is going to be more like when Larry King has people call in except we're cooler and he's old.
6918922	6926726	Well, you know, and I think a lot of the feedback I've kind of heard over the couple years we've been doing this, you know, because it seems like every year or two years we try something new with the format.
6927086	6930828	So about, we've been doing what, this whole combined A and B for about, what, a year and a half or so?
6931228	6934550	I think one of the feedback I get is, you know, we already kind of hear about the news.
6934710	6937912	I tune in to hear you guys, you know, talk about it, make jokes and so forth.
6938212	6942234	And the fact that, you know, not a lot of shows are as interactive as you guys.
6942274	6947457	I mean, granted, there's lots of shows that are trying to get interactive, you know, but they're kind of few and far between, right?
6947577	6947757	Hey, Rob.
6947777	6947877	What?
6947897	6948358	A dick went fart.
6948398	6948538	What?
6975272	6975973	I'm laughing.
6977975	6982119	I am going to go freshen up.
6984261	6985302	Let's see.
6985322	6988385	Let's get back into some of that gaming news that we're going to spend a little more time on tonight.
6988425	6989646	Of course, you can call us at any time.
6989666	6991147	1-877-GAME-OLR.
6991448	6996472	If we don't get to the story you wanted to talk about tonight, though, we will open up the skyline at the end of the show for Open Bar.
6997233	6997493	Loki!
6998334	7001775	You're going to start us off this half with another story.
7001995	7002455	Yes, I am.
7003515	7011877	So apparently the PS3 motion controller that they showed off at E3... You know what?
7011977	7013317	That always happens.
7013557	7013937	Damn it.
7014358	7014658	Sorry.
7015758	7019059	Maybe someday I'll learn how to fix my audio cues.
7019079	7019339	Sorry.
7019999	7020619	Yes, PlayStation 3.
7021158	7035414	Yes, so the new motion controller they showed off during their E3 press conference, it's apparently going to be compatible with existing games, which it makes sense because you can patch games and...
7036653	7037154	Why not?
7038555	7046942	I'm not sure if it's exactly going to work the way, say, you think... I don't know, a controller... Like, it wouldn't be mapped.
7047162	7052887	Like, if I move my arm down, it's not going to move the analog stick left down or something like that.
7052907	7054589	I don't think it's going to be like that.
7055129	7060594	But they may be able to patch it in to other games, which makes sense because they patched in DualShock 3 support.
7061675	7062155	Why not?
7062756	7063376	And you know what?
7063436	7063997	I support that.
7064037	7064217	I mean...
7065319	7066422	That'd be kind of cool.
7066442	7071494	Some of your older games get new life later on with this controller if you happen to buy it.
7072014	7074836	But here's my thing and the reason why I want to talk about this a little bit.
7074896	7079038	Do we really need motion control to be shoved down our throat in every game?
7079618	7081599	It doesn't have to be, but it's an option.
7082300	7088163	It's a good way, say, you put out the motion controller and there's, say, five games that support it.
7088443	7092405	Now you can have a bunch of games that support it, but it's still going to feel tacked on.
7092505	7095427	Maybe this is what I need to make me feel better about this.
7095767	7097428	Maybe callers want to input on this 1-877-GAME-OLR.
7097448	7097568	What...
7100168	7103959	Game would be better if they went back and added motion control.
7106519	7113864	What Sony PlayStation 3 game is going to be better if they go back and add this whole Sony... It doesn't have an official name, does it yet?
7114485	7115766	I think somebody said the PS3 mode.
7115946	7117847	Cosmic Ice Cream Cones of Wonder.
7117867	7119809	Okay, the Cosmic Ice Cream Cones.
7120329	7123912	What old PlayStation 3 game is going to be better with the Cosmic Ice Cream Cones?
7124072	7124472	I don't know.
7125072	7130096	Seeing as most PlayStation 3 games are on the Xbox 360, we don't have that yet.
7130156	7130776	Here's my thought.
7130817	7135540	Maybe they come up with a control scheme for a first-person shooter.
7136024	7138526	and then boom, they can put those in the first person shooter games.
7139367	7140627	You know, something that works well.
7141928	7143209	But yeah, you're right, I don't know.
7143370	7151716	Don't you think this is only going to show up though in the actual Sony, you know, first party in their own developer type of games?
7152056	7152937	Probably, yeah.
7154037	7155358	But, I mean, I don't know.
7156119	7162464	This is all coming from, you know, I want to say, Jack Trenton, who...
7165090	7168954	He says, personally, it's very difficult for me to perceive God of War 3 played with a Wii controller.
7169494	7172817	But it's a different experience that doesn't lend itself to certain types of games.
7173097	7181104	But I think our controller can be used with every game that's on the system now and every game that we're working on.
7181444	7184547	So he could just be blowing smoke up someone's ass.
7184907	7185868	My controller's awesome!
7185908	7186789	It works with everything!
7186829	7187650	It's super awesome!
7187690	7189631	Everything that we touch turns to gold!
7190012	7191373	You know, it's basically his...
7192854	7193374	Thought on it.
7193474	7196436	So really we could be reading way too much into this.
7197076	7208701	I think the games you're going to see that get this enhancement, like Infamous, Killzone 3, all the first person shooters basically, Uncharted, and Resistance.
7209301	7211962	Those will be the games that will support this whole Cosmic Ice Cream Codes.
7213823	7215944	Honestly, I don't think it's any of these games at all.
7216264	7219546	I think since this isn't going to come out for a while, it'll probably be...
7221539	7226323	I would be fine if they didn't even patch it backwards because it's just going to be tacking it on.
7226683	7230246	It's just, I don't know.
7231407	7243176	It's 1-1 control, so unless you have it really programmed in the game to be really intricate, I don't think it's going to work because you're just going to be making a gesture and it's going to do an action just like the Wii.
7244008	7266590	and I think a lot of it is resources for me that's why I kind of bring this up you know I know there's a lot of people out there that would say well what's the harm so they want to go back and add motion control in these games is that such a bad thing it's added value it's something extra but I'm saying well resources that could be used to instead make new games better why go back and patch the game with motion controls when you can make the sequel have motion controls
7267529	7268629	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7294241	7298124	Unless there really is a team still working on it, which I don't think there is.
7298644	7299425	I don't think there is either.
7300485	7302807	Let's move on and talk about something else with Sony.
7302847	7310492	And it has to do kind of from the same sort of original source that the whole PlayStation 3 motion control can do with.
7311513	7318157	I want to talk about the president of PlayStation, Jack Trenton, and leaks.
7319118	7321780	And a big quote he said, you know...
7322731	7323231	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7350933	7352074	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7369429	7370470	I don't know, at the same time.
7370670	7376473	A lot of people that work in the game industry stay in the game industry, so I would think there's talk amongst people.
7376913	7379674	Yes, they all sign NDAs, but I don't think they hold up.
7379815	7380695	Sniff out your moles.
7381015	7387298	If it's really a big issue for you and you really want to crack down on them, start releasing false information.
7387519	7391281	And then the people that report on it, you release a different one to each person.
7391721	7393882	And the people that report on that, then you know where it came from.
7395359	7397420	And then Trenton continues on with this quote.
7397560	7397780	Really?
7417466	7423551	I'm tired of all these podcasters that go on air and talk about all the different ways they interpret a patent.
7423931	7426053	No, he didn't really say that, but that's the way he's really saying it.
7426253	7447049	Really didn't water it down because the PSP Go, which has been rumored to be coming out for a while now, and then leaked by them, I mean, by Sony through Core, which really, can you complain about leaks and stuff when your own magazine seems to put out the information before your press conference?
7448251	7449952	Really, did it water it down at all?
7450132	7451552	In fact, I don't think it did.
7452533	7459895	If anything, it got people's hopes up, and then we saw what they announced the features for it, and we're like, eh, that sounds stupid.
7460715	7462976	It's like, oh, you didn't add a second analog stick?
7463196	7470359	Oh, you didn't make it so that, I don't know, it does other things other than normal PlayStation?
7470539	7473060	Oh, it's not going to be cheaper than the PSP 3000 or something like that?
7475646	7476107	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
7491205	7493726	What a great entry-level PSP system this is going to be.
7493766	7496686	It's going to be a great, cheap device that people are going to use.
7496706	7497707	They can get rid of the disk.
7497767	7498547	It's going to be cheap.
7498827	7499427	It's going to be easy.
7499447	7505368	What was the real surprise that we all got slapped with at E3?
7505608	7508249	No, I'd like to go on the record saying that I never thought it was a good idea.
7508589	7514690	But I did think that the whole not having a UMD drive in there was a stupid idea.
7514750	7517111	I couldn't believe that they were that stupid to do that.
7517771	7519071	And sure enough, they were that stupid.
7541727	7544330	Oh, but it has Blu-ray, and it's $600!
7545170	7549955	So whoever's determining what the prices should be at Sony needs to wake the fuck up, basically, is what it is.
7551076	7553539	And stop eating crayons, Jamie is yelling from the kitchen.
7555580	7557703	Isn't the door supposed to be shut while recording is in progress?
7557743	7558103	No, I'm kidding.
7561178	7573067	Alright, if you want to comment on this, 1877gameOLR, looking at some comments in chat, GameGuru says, cheap is the term that Sony needs to learn.
7573928	7577451	D5T says, moving to flash-based media is the future.
7577871	7579132	Movable parts are old.
7579472	7581033	See, I'm almost with him here.
7581113	7586757	I mean, you can't say Sony, screw you for losing UMD when you're also watching on the same token.
7586837	7595643	Microsoft's now getting into digital distribution with the whole classic Xbox 360 games, or I'm sorry, new Xbox 360 games available for download on the site.
7595963	7604029	You know, we were talking in the first half of the show tonight about Xbox possibly launching a cheaper console next year that's going to be targeted at the family audience.
7604389	7606991	Who's to say that if they do that, this system...
7607651	7615860	is going to lose the disk drive completely and could possibly be an online-only download thing using the hand-wavy Natal device to make you choose your games.
7616220	7618062	It won't work because people like buying stuff.
7618082	7620264	They like having the physical disk in their hand.
7620665	7625089	And yeah, I know people that have the iPhone and stuff go crazy over the App Store because there's everything in there.
7625490	7626171	But you know what?
7627312	7627872	It's just...
7628593	7633976	If you could go, if it took like discs or something like that, I'm sure people would probably want to buy this because you know what?
7634276	7635317	You know what you can do with discs?
7635577	7638459	You can return them when they don't work.
7638559	7640860	You can return them when you don't like them.
7640900	7643202	You can return them when you're done with them.
7643282	7644302	You can resell them.
7644682	7647144	With digital download, you bought it, you're stuck with it.
7647424	7648525	If it sucks, too bad.
7648705	7649145	You bought it.
7649585	7655889	Deekman in our chatroom, chat.orangelandsradio.com says the reason they gave for the price was to compete with the iPhone.
7656249	7657710	If Apple can do it, then so can we.
7657730	7657790	And
7659531	7663213	Basically, they think they can get away with it since people pay for it.
7663593	7666515	Apple's tech, they'll pay it for ours.
7667055	7668195	Oh, well, whoops.
7669056	7671537	It was just announced this week that the iPhone's coming down to $99.
7673098	7673398	DarkSakura.com
7690678	7695402	And seriously, if Sony didn't see that one coming, they are mentally deficient.
7695702	7699645	And whoever did not see that one coming at Sony needs to be fired.
7699765	7701826	They have no business working in business.
7702267	7704709	A moron walking off the street.
7705389	7710093	My mother, who doesn't even know how to put a CD in a computer, could tell you.
7711414	7714556	Apple, I love my mom, but she's technically stupid.
7715637	7717478	And I can say that in the nicest possible way.
7717999	7719380	Even my mother knows.
7720367	7742683	every every June Apple gets up there parades out Steve Jobs they couldn't do that this year obviously with their one more thing everybody knows Apple upgrades their shit every year and gets people to buy it all over again it works for Apple it is not going to work for Sony at those prices
7743993	7745174	Sony is not Apple.
7745494	7748917	And the other thing too is they have a huge following with Apple.
7749357	7751879	Sony doesn't quite have that following with the PSP.
7752399	7753140	And to be honest...
7754479	7760805	I really, really hate to say this, but there's more features in the iPhone than there are right now in the PSP.
7761085	7762366	I mean, it's got a touchscreen on it.
7762406	7766730	Hell, if they added a touchscreen to the PSP, that might be a whole different story.
7766790	7769212	Hey, that might be worth picking up because that's completely different.
7769272	7777119	It's going to open up a whole different set of possibilities if they had support with Bluetooth or something like that.
7777439	7778260	Big whoop.
7778720	7779160	Oh, goody.
7779981	7790530	And look, you know, and to those that want to make the argument that, well, you know, Apple releases their new, you know, toys at high end prices, you know, granted, I'll give you that.
7790991	7793613	Their laptops, I don't think I'm going to buy another Apple laptop.
7793893	7795995	They are too expensive for what you get.
7797416	7798217	For someone like me.
7800779	7801480	Your mic's not on, dear.
7801500	7801540	Oh.
7802113	7802693	Oh, shit.
7803593	7825200	I went to talking with some other people in the art industry, you know, and a couple people were actually saying that they were noticing that there's not as much need for people to have a Mac these days in the industry now that the PCs are catching up and, you know, different programs are saying, hey, people actually use PCs, you know.
7825960	7828841	So even that edge is starting to blur.
7828881	7828961	Yeah.
7829661	7833504	I think Apple's in for a rude awakening in the laptop market within the next couple years.
7833724	7836566	But they've got it on the iPhone.
7837027	7838668	Apple right now is a phone company.
7838988	7840249	That is what Apple is doing best.
7840269	7842751	They are a phone and music company.
7842811	7846013	They don't really... Well, God, I'm going to get so much hate mail for this.
7846273	7850937	But look, as somebody who's going out there wanting to get a new laptop and so forth...
7851417	7852558	DarkSakura.com
7871789	7875852	You have the $199 iPhone, the $249 PSP Go.
7876373	7877674	I can watch movies on both.
7877934	7878214	Check.
7878554	7879916	I can get on the internet with both.
7880216	7880516	Check.
7880836	7882097	I can play music on both.
7882398	7882678	Check.
7882978	7885460	I can play games on both that I download online.
7885580	7885900	Check.
7886281	7891625	The only thing the Sony PSP has got is that the games are of a higher caliber than the ones you see on the iPhone.
7891725	7892526	I will give it that.
7892586	7899711	Right now, and supposedly the 3GS has better specs or something than the 3G, so maybe they will...
7902523	7904025	Be a little bit better later on.
7905326	7910952	And it also doesn't have actual control pads, so that does kind of limit them as far as games go.
7913567	7919611	Um, Ranma in chat says, Rob Roberts, everything you have done on your MacBook can be done on a $500 PC laptop flawlessly.
7919951	7921452	That's what I'm starting to find out too.
7921552	7925275	And part of what I loved about Macs is that they were so easy, you know, so great.
7925715	7926496	But here's the nice thing.
7926756	7929898	PC, finally, someone at Microsoft kind of wised up.
7930078	7934001	Oh my gosh, Apple's starting to bite into us a little bit here with this whole, I think they're making it easier.
7934813	7935113	I don't know.
7935233	7937695	I'm going to open up this whole can of worms on the computer debate.
7937715	7938515	That's not what I want to do.
7938996	7941337	I want to talk about the PSP Go and all this stuff.
7941797	7945920	And the whole fact that it's $2.49 is way too much to be charging for that.
7946740	7948801	Actually, that wasn't even really originally what I wanted to talk about.
7949021	7953824	It was supposed to be about keeping secrets in the industry and people not respecting confidentiality in the industry.
7953844	7957086	There's this fine line here.
7962259	7963480	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7984825	7987266	How much is too much in regards to confidentiality?
7987646	7989247	I mean, the demand is out there.
7989327	7990087	People want to know.
7990387	7994568	The millisecond these things are thought of, Sony is even thinking about doing this.
7995108	7996149	People want to know about it.
7996409	7999230	How far is too far with this whole confidentiality?
7999470	8000570	Did this go too far?
8001030	8003871	Did the PSP go getting announced early and a lot of these other things?
8003951	8005252	Was that too far?
8005272	8006512	I don't know.
8006532	8008553	I don't have an easy answer for this.
8008573	8009793	Then don't tell these people.
8009893	8012334	If you want to keep a secret, you don't say anything.
8013188	8018070	You don't keep a secret by saying, go and tell 100 people, oh, by the way, don't tell anybody this.
8018090	8021292	But don't you have to tell your developers that are going to be making the games?
8021772	8025614	Well, obviously someone else is blogging about it and leaking this stuff out.
8026254	8030616	You have people that are leaking out stuff all the time, and they can hide behind the internet.
8030976	8031936	They can be whomever.
8031996	8042021	They can be some industry mole and go on the record and stuff, and they probably get some sort of joy out of having the exclusive story that no one knows about.
8044693	8045595	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
8055154	8057015	How come all these other people can get away with it?
8057035	8058535	That's where it gets de-irritating.
8058555	8072961	We've also seen in the past too with NDAs where other people are given preferential treatment because they're a big website and they're going to run an exclusive story or let's decide which website gets to run the exclusive story.
8072981	8078204	And that's the shit that needs to stop right now because that's just encouraging people to one-up others.
8078384	8078864	I'm sorry.
8079164	8079884	No pun intended.
8083246	8083506	Anyhow.
8084611	8085131	Let's move on.
8108109	8108550	Outro Music
8127412	8131293	And removing features to cut costs is not an answer, Apple.
8131753	8132414	So, anyhow.
8133274	8133494	Sorry.
8134174	8135935	I apologize for getting completely off track.
8136295	8137335	Let's get back to video games.
8137595	8139976	And oh, what a video game on the next story, correct?
8140156	8140476	Yes.
8141196	8143537	Of course, this is a classic in...
8143977	8173197	A Remade Game Now Coming To Xbox Live Arcade As An Exclusive For A Limited Time That Would Be Of Course The Brand New Or I Guess Brand New Remade Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Turtles In Time Reshelled Which Looks Pretty Awesome Actually Completely Redone 3D And Of Course Will Be Available On Xbox Live Arcade July 22nd But As For The Playstation Network
8174079	8174659	Later this year.
8197188	8199869	Is there some underlying technical problem that's causing this to be delayed?
8199889	8201150	I don't think there's a technical problem at all.
8201330	8202651	I think it's a deal.
8202731	8205692	Because if you think about it, this is actually part of the Summer of Live.
8206153	8209875	Or the Live Arcade, Summer of Arcade, whatever the hell they're calling that.
8210355	8212996	So they're going to get an extra marketing push because of that.
8213196	8216918	And probably the deal was that they got to put it out later because of that.
8217098	8218299	What marketing push?
8219099	8219800	I mean, really?
8220060	8224502	Is being in the Summer of Arcade that much of a boost to sales?
8224542	8225002	It might be.
8225282	8225643	Really?
8225663	8225743	Yeah.
8226661	8227142	What do they do?
8227442	8229485	What's the big deal about being in the summer of arcade?
8230046	8233831	The fact that they cluster a lot of highly anticipated games all together.
8234451	8237636	But for most Xbox Live Arcade games, I can think of anything I've anticipated.
8237756	8239178	I knew where to seek it out and buy it.
8239819	8242302	Do they run extra ads in magazines?
8242342	8242963	They have like a...
8244003	8245664	I guess.
8245764	8248045	It just doesn't seem like that much of a boost.
8248085	8249526	Well, I'm just speculating.
8249586	8250586	I don't know.
8251026	8253407	Maybe they had trouble developing it on the PlayStation Network.
8253567	8254328	I don't know what it is.
8254408	8256969	I don't think they would because Ubisoft, I would imagine.
8257369	8258149	Well, they're publishing it.
8258189	8259450	Who knows who's developing it?
8259490	8261971	I don't know.
8263431	8264692	It could be something retarded.
8265072	8266233	It probably is something retarded.
8267533	8268234	But you know what?
8268294	8269174	Just get used to it.
8270543	8272046	I need to see more of this game in action.
8272146	8278015	So it's pretty much a port of the old arcade game but with the cooler, upgraded graphics?
8278376	8279197	Yeah.
8280139	8280860	I guess that's kind of neat.
8282223	8284485	Super NES Exclusive, wasn't the Super Famicom version a direct port?
8301681	8302662	Maybe Turtles and Thieves
8329898	8334500	And then DarkTetsuya says, I forget, I just remember the Super Nintendo version having the extra levels and bosses.
8335000	8336100	Ooh, are we getting some of that in this?
8336240	8337101	Extra levels and stuff?
8337401	8338301	There might be extra levels.
8339301	8342843	I mean, THB Ninja Turtles was a pretty huge Xbox Live game when it came out anyway.
8343523	8345804	Folks playing it online and having fun on live with it.
8345864	8347384	So I'm sure this is going to be no different.
8347505	8348185	I'm sure it'll be fun.
8348405	8348585	Yeah.
8348945	8350145	So, there you go.
8350806	8355487	Alright, well that game will be coming out July 22nd, I believe it was.
8355587	8356728	So keep an eye out for that.
8357918	8358799	Metal Gear Solid Rising
8373274	8375715	A lot of people were waiting for it, the whole Metal Gear Solid 4 thing.
8375755	8383357	Of course, now it should be noted, Metal Gear Solid Rising is not exclusive to the Xbox, or it's going on Xbox and PlayStation.
8383777	8389599	And a lot of folks are saying, well, this is, you know, it's going to still be, it's like Metal Gear is continuing on, or what have you.
8390379	8394800	But, apparently, it is a whole new engine for Metal Gear Solid Rising.
8394820	8401182	If you're thinking this is Metal Gear Solid 4 Plus, or some game that was made in Metal Gear Solid 4's engine, uh-uh.
8402600	8409762	Sean Eyestone, who is an assistant producer at Kojima Productions, says the team is remaking Rising's engine from scratch.
8410222	8414943	Their goal is to make it look better than Metal Gear Solid 4.
8415623	8420385	This is from a Kojima Productions podcast that came out this week.
8421485	8424666	Apparently, they are saying it is a big project like Metal Gear Solid 4.
8425266	8429347	The team is serious about making it look as good as possible on every platform.
8431015	8431575	Thanks for watching!
8449148	8458472	And, you know, now it's coming out on both systems because I think they know that it would be a mistake to skip on the 360 because there is a lot of potential sales there.
8458492	8464554	Especially now that they didn't have Metal Gear Solid 4 and so they're going to get a lot more money out of it.
8464634	8467555	And it's all about money nowadays because, you know, times are tough.
8468156	8470096	So, I'm not surprised.
8470616	8471317	And I am...
8472358	8475761	I don't know, it'd be weird if they kind of went in the opposite direction.
8476662	8479845	But, I mean, it makes sense to them, just to put it out on both systems.
8480806	8485750	TheRobD in chat, by the way, says, So we're going from talking about a Turtles game to talking about Solid Snakes.
8485850	8486751	What does this show become?
8487172	8489894	Yes, it's Reptile Jungle tonight on Orange Lounge Radio, apparently.
8490234	8493017	Chat.OrangeLoungeRadio.com if you want to make a smart-ass comment like that one.
8493678	8493758	Um...
8495479	8506913	But, you know, I guess at first, when I first heard about this, I was like, oh, they're cranking this game out so fast because Metal Gear Solid 4, they're just going to reuse that engine and so forth.
8506933	8508895	But now, that doesn't seem to be the case.
8509416	8509716	So...
8511637	8512997	You could look at this a couple of ways.
8513418	8517258	I get really excited when I hear, oh, they're going to make it look even better and so forth.
8517658	8523300	But weren't they saying one of the reasons that they didn't port Metal Gear Solid 4 to the Xbox 360?
8523680	8525920	And let's face it, folks, they never will at this point.
8526160	8527000	It is not happening.
8527400	8528361	This is what you're getting.
8528701	8530381	Be happy with this, Microsoft fans.
8530901	8533682	There is not Metal Gear Solid 4 coming to the Xbox 360.
8534042	8537022	If that was ever going to happen, it would have been announced before this.
8537682	8540083	So, that being said...
8541585	8548048	They said that Metal Gear Solid 4 would not be ported to the Xbox 360 because it was made for Blu-ray.
8548268	8552950	The types of graphics that were on it and everything that was packed in that disc was made for Blu-ray.
8553491	8563355	So that makes me think, okay, well then by that argument, if they're scaling this back to fit every platform, they're going to have to scale it back, not make it better.
8563816	8564156	Wrong.
8564516	8566437	And this goes back to what we were talking about earlier.
8567438	8578964	Melgar Solve 4 was going to max out the PS3, but now they've learned that they can optimize their code, there's different techniques, and to be honest, I mean, their excuse was, oh, it's so big it can only fit on Blu-ray.
8579424	8588429	But at the same time, you know, oh, and no one wants to swap discs, by the way, which is retarded because there's like a five minute install between like sections of the game.
8589974	8590554	I mean, come on.
8590714	8592035	They could have easily swapped discs.
8592115	8598177	I'd rather spend two seconds to swap a disc than spend five minutes loading a section of the game to my hard drive.
8598338	8604600	And if I really wanted to do that with multiple discs, I can do that now in the new Microsoft interface.
8604660	8606421	I can install each portion if I wanted to.
8606801	8608582	TigerClaw in chat makes a really good point.
8608642	8612464	Says, also noticed Metal Gear Solid Rising says, lightning bolt action.
8612864	8614304	Maybe it's a new type of gameplay.
8614604	8617626	Given that Raiden is a ninja, it could very well be a hack and slash game.
8618866	8623567	Have we had anything confirmed that this is a stealth action game like the other Metal Gear Solid games?
8623947	8625348	Or is Tigerclaw into something here?
8625388	8629549	Because it's not Metal Gear Solid 5, it's Metal Gear Solid Rising.
8630489	8635690	Maybe the type of game we're anticipating here should be, maybe we need to set our expectations for something different.
8635990	8637991	Maybe we're looking at an action game, a beat-em-up.
8639224	8639904	I don't know about that.
8639924	8643566	The Turtles in Time version of Metal Gear Solid.
8643886	8648668	I don't know about that far, but that is interesting that it doesn't say anything about the whole stealth.
8649028	8650149	It's lightning bolt action.
8653590	8656372	Do you think that would be as successful if they change up the genre?
8659133	8659513	Maybe.
8660113	8660593	Maybe not.
8661514	8662914	I guess it just depends on how good the game is.
8662934	8666356	I think people will bitch and moan, but they'll probably still buy it because they're Metal Gear Solid fans.
8666963	8667324	Perhaps.
8668465	8669026	Alright, we'll see.
8669346	8670568	Let's continue on with some more news.
8670949	8676937	If you want to call us on this or any topic we're talking about, 1-877-GAME-OLR.
8676957	8678079	We had a phone call a little while.
8678359	8678820	Don't be shy.
8678880	8679241	Give us a call.
8679261	8679481	1-877-GAME-OLR.
8681840	8686542	Well, Xbox Live Community Games, they're getting a little bit of a facelift.
8686982	8696025	Starting in late July, Xbox Live Community Games will now be changing to Xbox Live Indie Games.
8696985	8705448	And apparently it's in response to community feedback in order to increase understanding and promote the games.
8706108	8708789	So they're going to launch XNA Game Studio 3.1 and
8712315	8713036	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
8742964	8743384	Thanks for watching!
8751491	8755653	A lot of them are really good, but a lot of them are really, really bad.
8755673	8758895	What do you think about this whole rating system that's coming into the games?
8758955	8760555	Is this going to be a good thing or a bad thing?
8760736	8761416	I think it's a good thing.
8761936	8766158	It'll be able to separate the crap from the not crap.
8766578	8771701	I would love to see user-rated stuff, so I can look at these games that people think are great.
8772141	8776243	Maybe have a way that you can see what your friends rate it, or something like that.
8776283	8778244	If I have similar tastes as, say, Rob, I can...
8779264	8779525	DigEffect
8789266	8794070	You know how stories get bumped to the top of dig.com that you're like, why the hell is this here?
8794551	8798174	And it's because so-and-so has millions of friends that will dig up the story for them.
8798694	8802878	And to be fair, we've had it happen to our stories before, and I'm sure that's thanks to our OL Army.
8803299	8804420	So don't hear me wrong.
8804460	8806562	It's not necessarily a bad thing or whatever.
8807002	8814228	But I would be worried in regards to this context with the whole indie games is that what if a game maker...
8814949	8815890	and DarkSakura.com
8830526	8831166	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
8849757	8866701	But it sucks that somebody who, you know, might be a fan of some other show who doesn't know how to support any podcasting, who deserves to have karma bite him in the ass or something, can have somebody go around and rate a bunch of other shows a 1 and nothing gets taken, you know, no action gets taken against that user.
8867021	8873002	Like, that user's opinion carries just as much weight as somebody who actually thinks out their reviews.
8873282	8874763	Does that make any sense at all what I'm saying?
8874803	8875403	Yeah, it makes sense.
8875483	8875683	Like...
8876663	8881587	I would fear that just because somebody has a lot of friends, their game gets all this extra exposure.
8881987	8884169	And you look at the top shows on iTunes.
8884209	8885450	Again, going back to iTunes, sorry.
8885730	8887512	But it's something I feel pretty passionate about.
8887772	8896979	You look at all the top shows on iTunes, most of them are one-ups, IGNs, GameSpots, G4s, commercial, down-your-throat type fare.
8898360	8903224	And it kind of sucks for the rest of us when podcasts are supposed to be an indie thing.
8904056	8904877	Thanks for watching!
8925100	8925941	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
8950323	8975127	rate the raters would be a great thing rate the raters that's something they need to bring to iTunes is rating the raters and you kind of can to a little bit you can say was this comment helpful yes or no but it really doesn't have any bearing on the author as a whole I think that's something I would like to see is you rate the rater and as the raters rating goes up their rating carries more weight and as it goes down it loses weight that's what I'd like to see
8977016	8978517	That was a lot of uses of the word rate.
8978837	8979878	Only in the perfect world.
8980558	8980759	Yeah.
8981159	8981979	But I don't know.
8981999	8983060	I kind of think that's the way to do it.
8985922	8990645	But yeah, that one indie game you were talking about earlier in the show, Attack... What was it?
8990705	8991485	Barry Attack?
8991605	8992526	It was Angry Barry.
8992606	8993186	Angry Barry.
8993226	8994307	And you know where I saw that.
8995307	9002292	And I hate to say this, but IGN, actually, they do a segment that's a community shower, I think is what they call it.
9002712	9004013	And basically they cover...
9004873	9006073	Thanks for watching!
9026600	9034469	Maren in chat brings up a good point and says, but what if somebody doesn't agree with the rating person and so they rate the person lowly based on their opinion, not their review rating?
9034889	9035790	That's a fair argument.
9035951	9036391	I mean, I guess...
9037472	9058447	The system's, it's going to basically, what it's going to come down to is, yeah, there's going to be people that are going to do that and, you know, rally their friends, but in the end it all equals out because there's a lot more people not involved with them that, you know, are going to be raiding stuff, so that it'll be just a slight fluctuation and that's really kind of, you've got to account for that kind of error in there, so.
9059267	9060068	Well, I hope you're right.
9061009	9062190	We can all hear you eating over there.
9062770	9063950	I just hit the mic with my plate.
9066271	9069152	Also, Kay Levster says, I think it will sort itself out.
9069472	9072253	The Xbox Live community is far more liquid than Dig.
9072934	9073514	I don't know, though.
9073574	9075195	There's some real, like, come on.
9075255	9076555	You've played Halo Online.
9076695	9079316	I don't know if you have, but a lot of you have played Halo Online.
9079356	9082317	There are some people who play those games online.
9082497	9083838	I don't want to hear their opinions.
9084198	9085658	I don't want to hear what they have to say.
9086059	9086559	You know what I mean?
9087319	9090143	These people that get on there and say N-word, N-word, F-word, F-word.
9090404	9091225	You know who I'm talking about.
9092086	9094109	Is there a way I can just block out their ratings?
9094430	9097494	If I block them on Xbox Live, will it block their ratings out too?
9097634	9102442	I think it would be really smart and it would also, once again, go back to tying in.
9102922	9111586	You can do, like, with your Xbox Live Arcade games, you can see where you rank, like, in the leaderboards versus the world versus, you know, your friends.
9111766	9113967	And I think the reviews should also be the same way.
9114307	9119530	If your friends have reviewed that, you should be able to see their reviews or you can just see the community as a whole.
9119610	9120430	Ooh, like Netflix.
9120910	9121330	Netflix.
9121650	9122031	Perfect.
9122151	9122731	Perfect model.
9122931	9124712	And Xbox has it in with Netflix anyway.
9125352	9125492	Right?
9125512	9125792	There you go.
9126072	9126493	There you go.
9126693	9127593	Steal from Netflix.
9128213	9128834	There's the answer.
9128994	9129214	Great.
9131602	9135364	I want to move on to another story, and it has to do with Microsoft.
9135384	9136405	A whole lot of Microsoft tonight.
9136705	9145210	But Project Natal, going back to that, we were talking about it a little bit during Part A, but it's made its mainstream television debut.
9145611	9148632	That's right, it showed up on Late Night with Jimmy Fallon.
9149333	9150854	It showed up a little earlier this week.
9151614	9159936	Oops, I'm bringing up the actual Hulu thing here in studio, although they're going to do a commercial here, so I'm going to mute it for that because if the commercial people aren't going to pay us, I'm not going to rebroadcast that.
9160316	9164657	But I do want to show a little bit about the whole Jimmy Fallon late night thing.
9165277	9171218	They actually showed Natal on it, and I don't know why, but they all were wearing these red jumpsuits and things when they were demoing it.
9171518	9176559	But certainly it was interesting, if nothing else, to actually see Natal.
9177259	9181061	This being played by somebody who wasn't a Microsoft spokesperson.
9181361	9181882	You know what I mean?
9182582	9184603	It was a real person at least checking this out.
9185764	9188625	Let's actually see if we can check this out just a little bit here.
9189606	9190546	It's a bunch of red shirts.
9190586	9190946	Kill them.
9190966	9195349	I'm going to actually forward ahead a little bit here in the video so we can actually see where they're playing.
9197108	9198309	Jimmy Fallon, you're not funny.
9198329	9198589	Still.
9198669	9200810	Let me forward a little ahead to where they're actually playing.
9225000	9226941	It's like a 3D little breakout game.
9226981	9229103	This is one of the games they were showing, actually, at E3.
9229183	9230464	It's one of the demos.
9231505	9232786	Kind of cool.
9233787	9238110	Yeah, it looks like fun, you know, to flail around like a fool for a little while, but I don't know for how long.
9238991	9244836	Again, I don't think there's an actual game here, but if this is a minigame in a much larger game, I think this could be cool.
9245076	9246137	You're doing it like volleyball.
9248482	9252565	Yeah, I mean, the game, you know, it looks like it might be fun for a little while.
9253245	9256047	I don't know about the longevity of it, but, you know, a lot of Wii games.
9256067	9256768	I think this is a demo.
9256788	9257708	This is a demo, though.
9257808	9261231	Yeah, but, okay, yeah, to be fair, it's a tech demo, no, like, gameplay.
9261291	9262572	So was Wii Sports and Wii Play?
9262592	9265234	So a lot of the things you saw on Wii Play were tech demos, too.
9265534	9268396	I think this will come out if nothing else is an Xbox Live Arcade game.
9268596	9269196	You'll see this.
9269577	9270938	They'll make a game out of this somehow.
9272399	9278126	I honestly see a whole lot of potential for this technology, though.
9278166	9278947	There really is.
9281129	9284293	Honestly, I'm not ready to pass judgment on it yet.
9285274	9285795	Really, I'm not.
9286764	9288905	SSJ100 Matt makes a correction to something I was saying.
9288945	9291666	Correction, Rob, that was the only demo they did on stage, I believe.
9291946	9292586	That's a good point.
9292626	9295027	When they did that whole Milo thing, that was a pre-taped video.
9295208	9296908	But they did a demo on stage, though.
9296948	9301230	They did that exact same game on stage with Project Natal at the press conference.
9301250	9304471	So this is like their touring game that they have to show at the stuff.
9304751	9311734	But still, the nice thing about it was it was, you know, say what you want to about Jimmy Fallon and his humor or lack thereof.
9312215	9314555	He's not somebody in the game industry.
9314656	9315316	He's like a...
9315836	9316437	Thank you for watching!
9332020	9334683	and they weren't letting regular people play it.
9334743	9336584	This was a huge step in actually seeing this.
9336965	9343230	By the way, sorry to get off track here, but what is up with Jimmy Fallon tapping into the game industry lately?
9343350	9348094	His thing was that he wants to treat game releases like movie releases.
9348134	9353679	He's a big gamer, I guess, and apparently he's going to start doing more content like this.
9354653	9355374	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
9371331	9372632	Well, to be fair, you know what?
9372652	9375733	To be fair, Conan had a real rough first six months.
9376134	9378295	You know, a lot of people wrote him off when the show first started.
9378575	9379896	He didn't find his niche for a year.
9380196	9382317	So I'm willing to give Jimmy Fallon a year, whatever.
9382637	9387419	But all that aside, you know, he has been pretty decent, I guess, about coverage.
9387660	9394203	I feel like I'm getting more gaming coverage watching Jimmy Fallon than I am most times I'm watching G4, E3 accepted.
9394263	9394763	You know what I mean?
9395424	9396164	Yeah.
9396184	9399386	They had Jason Sudeikis or whatever his name is kind of around at E3.
9400694	9401415	That's kind of funny.
9401435	9404978	I like the little video they did for that.
9406800	9408822	Yeah, Kay Levster in chat makes a funny comment.
9409523	9412326	He wants to get his games for free, thus now he's scared.
9414187	9416430	TigerClaw says Jimmy Fallon is a bit of a tech geek.
9416490	9418552	He had the guys from Dignation on the show before.
9419192	9421615	He's living up to his promising of promoting video games.
9423116	9424538	Well, I'm glad somebody is.
9427287	9443656	Alright, well, regardless, it was kind of nice to see Natal actually kind of making a show on a big, you know, well, I don't know if you want to say big, but a fair, a show that has at least a million people watching it and getting, you know, a live, real person who doesn't work for the company playing it.
9446200	9469505	Now to kind of change topics a little bit, apparently Alexey Pajanov, the creator of Tetris, of course Tetris just had its 25th anniversary not too long ago, apparently he's saying that he wants, well it's so huge right now with 125 million copies sold,
9472246	9476950	and probably one of the biggest, most recognized games out there.
9478211	9482734	He's saying they could see probably an evolution of Tetris becoming a sport.
9483975	9493703	Of course, the future is that a country that has 48 million people living in it and the biggest casual gaming site in the country has 24 million registered users.
9494063	9495244	That country is Korea.
9495804	9497606	That's what's going to happen in the rest of the world.
9498126	9504371	So kind of like, you know, everybody competing in this first virtual sport.
9505032	9511958	Sports like baseball and football were created at a time when their future was a lifetime of physical activities and physical fitness.
9512278	9514460	But now that's not as important.
9515120	9517222	It's more about mental fitness today.
9517703	9520245	And Tetris is a virtual sport that exercises the mind.
9520605	9522487	That's the definition of a virtual sport.
9525660	9528521	So how exactly would... I guess I'm not getting it.
9528561	9530582	How exactly... Where would the sport be in this?
9530622	9531463	Competing one-on-one.
9531503	9536025	It's just, you know, a bunch of people in a Tetris tournament.
9536825	9537366	The end.
9538786	9539066	Hmm.
9540207	9545189	Interesting, though, that it seems like we always have this video games as a sport discussion comes up once in a while.
9545229	9546790	Remember when they wanted to make DDR a sport?
9546850	9548131	Or they did in a couple of countries.
9548171	9549371	I know, but here's the thing.
9549791	9550732	I think we're looking at it...
9551969	9554110	When we say sports, we think physical sports.
9554450	9557752	And he's trying to say that there's other sports out there, like chess.
9557933	9561535	Chess is not a physical... I mean, you play it physically, but it's more mental.
9561675	9562615	Is chess at the Olympics?
9563876	9565157	I don't think so.
9565777	9566157	I don't know.
9566618	9567678	That's a very good question.
9568058	9569239	I wonder if one of our chatters knows.
9569299	9570380	Is chess an Olympic sport?
9571781	9572341	I don't think it is.
9573742	9574842	But, like, you know, stuff like that.
9574902	9578564	You know, nowadays, you know, with a lot of gamers out there, and now they have, you know, the...
9579793	9582202	Championship Gaming stuff that they do which
9583723	9591168	Making people into actual teams and stuff like that and promoting them like a football team and stuff, that's cool and all, but I don't know.
9591808	9593229	Not really the model I see.
9593550	9594810	Three no's in chat, by the way.
9595931	9597152	Chess is not an Olympic sport.
9597712	9602255	In fact, I even Googled it, and there was an article in Time Magazine August 5th of 08.
9603336	9608660	Chess and bridge enthusiasts, they are lobbying the International Olympic Committee to allow their games.
9608680	9609700	I don't think that they should be.
9609880	9613403	I mean, the Olympics is a physical sports competition.
9613863	9614624	It shouldn't be.
9615725	9618949	DDR shouldn't be really a sport.
9619109	9623313	I mean, you play it physically, but it's not... I don't know.
9623333	9624555	DDR is hard to compete in anyways.
9624615	9631121	It's basically about accuracy as far as a way to actually grade it and freestyle and stuff.
9631141	9633204	It's kind of stupid because that's just interpretive dance, so...
9633973	9634253	I don't know.
9655990	9658691	So why shouldn't Tetris be on... Did you ever see the movie Dodgeball?
9659512	9659772	No.
9659872	9662373	Because Jamie's giving us this look of like, what the hell are you guys saying?
9662634	9663514	That's the joke.
9663594	9665035	I want to know what planet you're from.
9665215	9665715	All right, anyway.
9667376	9667636	What else?
9668217	9669237	Ah, now I lost my train of thought.
9669257	9670178	Choo-choo, derailed.
9670698	9676381	Is this the type of thing that he thinks should be televised or what?
9677588	9678268	I guess we don't know.
9678869	9679390	I don't know.
9679650	9685679	I mean, this is just him making a comment and bloggers picking up on it and going, Oh my god, he thinks it should be a sport!
9685980	9692649	Well, let's say it was the type of sport that you would see on The Ocho, or in all reality ESPN2 or something like that.
9692769	9693410	Would you watch it?
9693490	9693731	Nope.
9695256	9707788	I'm curious, chatters, if Tetris was a sport and they broadcast the big showdowns live on ESPN or ESPN2 or ABC Wild World of Sports, would you watch it?
9709250	9710791	I guess this all goes into competitive gaming.
9710811	9711452	Human Tetris.
9713474	9715576	Well, they did make a show out of that, aren't they?
9715756	9717337	Isn't that going to be a show on Fox or something?
9717658	9718559	It is already.
9718579	9719720	Yeah, it's the wall.
9721527	9724349	They did it as a gag on Ellen, like five minutes a week or something.
9724369	9725530	Well, it was in Japan.
9725590	9730994	It's an actual show in Japan, and they do it for fun there, but, you know, we have to do it for prizes.
9731655	9733156	No such thing as fun in game shows.
9734257	9740462	Osfer in chat says, I go to Ohio tournaments often, and I can say that DDR is definitely competitive enough to be an Olympic sport.
9741682	9746266	Chat.orangeentrader.com Kay Lefster says, Watching Tetris is like watching golf.
9746506	9747187	So, no.
9747995	9749896	There's a whole channel dedicated to golf though, mind you.
9749936	9750417	Exactly.
9750597	9751217	A whole channel.
9752238	9758902	It just wouldn't be something that, I mean, it's hard to make it interesting, I guess.
9758922	9763165	If you're going to say no to that though, what about competitive gaming on TV?
9763225	9765266	Should we just not have competitive gaming on TV then?
9765606	9772531	Like the Counter-Strike tournaments and whatever the first person shooter hit of the week happens to be that they're playing online?
9772851	9774192	Should they not be televised either?
9774452	9777133	No, I don't think it's an issue of them being televised at all.
9777273	9779954	It's just a way of how we're able to capture it and film it.
9780534	9786396	Sports, that's easy to televise because usually all the gameplay and stuff is going on in one area.
9786476	9789638	You can zoom back to catch the whole field and stuff like that.
9790078	9792659	Doing Counter-Strike, you can't really film that.
9792959	9797961	There's no way that you can see everything that's going on all at once because of the nature of the game it is.
9798041	9800242	You have to focus on the different players and stuff.
9800522	9800802	I guess...
9802014	9826612	I don't know, it's a, you know, NASCAR, you can kind of do that kind of stuff where you can film the whole pack of cars and stuff, but they do, like, the in-car camps and that kind of thing, but, um, it's just, it's hard to film it and make it interesting in the same way as, like, a football game or a baseball game or something like that where they've been doing it for years and they've figured out, you know, they have commentators and know what they're talking about and stuff like that, but it's like...
9827858	9837786	If you started filming Counter-Strike or something like that, and you started talking about it, and you had commentators going, I don't know who these people are.
9838127	9845913	I'm aware that Counter-Strike exists and what it basically is, but I don't know who any of these players are, and this wouldn't really be interesting to me.
9847234	9847614	I don't know.
9847735	9854020	It's just really tough to broadcast this stuff, and you're not going to get the same responses like...
9855180	9858701	The Rob D in chat makes a comment.
9860041	9860421	Let's see.
9860481	9862042	This is the problem with competitive gaming.
9862102	9863422	How many different things can happen?
9863822	9866823	In football, you might see something that you've never seen before every week.
9867643	9869664	In DDR, the participants aren't even interacting.
9869704	9871284	It's a matter of seeing who scores the most.
9871684	9874845	I think it would take a lot more animations and reactions to make it more interesting.
9874945	9877085	And it's hard, too, with a fighting game or something.
9877405	9879686	I think the fighting game would be the easiest thing to...
9880206	9883830	Film, because it's all one screen, you can see all the action all at once.
9885452	9889857	But the problem is, it's moving so fast, it's hard to commentate on that.
9889937	9893761	You can't really commentate, whereas there's baseball, there's a lot of different...
9902739	9903519	Thank you for watching!
9929064	9931526	Also a lot of talk about that old show Arena on G4.
9931546	9933728	A lot of fans of that show in our chat room right now.
9934248	9935389	I wasn't that big on Arena.
9935429	9935889	You know why?
9935909	9937431	Because it was so heavily edited.
9937851	9939912	You were only really seeing the highlights of every match.
9940413	9945216	And I don't know, I felt like I didn't learn enough about the game and the actual strategy and how to get better from just seeing.
9945256	9949359	And it was so fast, the way they went back and forth from all the different pieces.
9949439	9953082	I never felt like I really understood what was going on watching that show.
9953723	9956945	Maybe it's just because I'm not into first person shooters as much as I am other games, but...
9957826	9968153	See, they could do something, I don't even know if a game exists out there like that, but like Call of Duty 4, actually this would be more like Operation Flashpoint 2, I think, because it's more open world.
9968473	9972597	But you could do something where you have two different teams, you could show them strategizing you.
9973457	9976258	about the game beforehand, you know, planning out stuff.
9976498	9987239	They could talk about the different possibilities, how they may be able to, like, okay, you know, team, you know, the red team right here can, you know, go down flank under this, you know, through this valley or something like that, you know, but then they have to watch out.
9987279	9993200	So there's a lot of commentary and, like, visual aids that they could do there, but it's just, it's really tough.
9994401	10001262	Once again, and I pretty much stress this almost every sentence now, it's really tough to film this stuff, to make it interesting.
10001522	10001862	You just...
10003720	10004040	I don't know.
10004901	10020215	Unless it's like a NASCAR game or like Project Gotham would kind of work because they had the spectator mode where you can actually watch the cars and stuff racing around almost like as you were watching a television production of a race.
10020615	10024999	So you could do something similar like that and that might work as far as commentary and stuff goes.
10025399	10031627	I don't know if first person shooters are really going to work because it's so massive and there's so much stuff going on.
10042089	10045551	SSJ100 Matt says this, and then we're going to move on towards the end of the show here.
10046191	10051214	The fact is, statistics and ratings show people don't really care for watching people playing video games.
10051874	10054776	Yet StarCraft televised competitions works in Korea.
10055816	10064380	TigerClaw in chat says the problem with showing live gameplay of Attorney is the action can get very repetitive and the average viewer will get bored by it.
10064720	10067362	While us gamers are used to seeing the repetitiveness of the games.
10068262	10069163	Alright, we're going to leave it there.
10069203	10070903	If you have further comments you can always send us an email.
10070943	10075786	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com But we want to get to the FUs of the week.
10076006	10078367	And of course something has to inspire the FUs of the week.
10078947	10081889	What better than a stupid gamer doing something stupid?
10082469	10083510	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
10104038	10107759	The older brother said the weapon automatically went off when the two fought over it.
10113100	10122403	By the way, they're saying that it is unlikely the kid will be charged because he is under 13 years old and the entire incident appeared to be an accident anyway.
10123183	10125783	That's the part that disturbs me a lot.
10126604	10127324	Like, a lot.
10128184	10131745	Like, I realize he's a child, but...
10133317	10139499	Oh my god, like, not a mention of the parents, and like, what parent keeps a shotgun accessible to their 11-year-old?
10140459	10142039	Obviously not, you know, a good one.
10142279	10142420	Oh.
10143820	10145980	This just gives gamers everywhere a bad name, too.
10146040	10152422	I hate it when stories like this are picked up by video game blogs, too, because it's just kind of like, this really didn't have anything to do with video games.
10152582	10162345	Yeah, they fought over video games, but, you know, maybe not so much the gamer blogs, but I hate it when the mainstream media picks up these stories, because it makes gamers look violent when this really has nothing to do with the video games.
10162625	10170988	This has everything to do with just blatant stupidity and bad, bad, bad, terrible parenting.
10173990	10175050	So with that, the FU's of the week.
10190549	10193332	Oh, DarkSakura, would you care to start us off with a rant of your own tonight?
10194112	10195253	F you to not letting shit go.
10197816	10198156	Loki.
10199718	10207865	Um, F you to moving, especially my cat, which it's not really her fault, but she can't sleep right now because she's worried and doesn't know what's going on.
10207905	10212149	Cats have trouble adjusting to moving places, so she kept this up all night.
10212329	10215272	Oh, and F you to myself for accidentally breaking the, uh,
10215672	10224841	Waterline going to my fridge, causing it to drip, but in defense, I think it's broken before I messed with it anyway.
10225822	10229305	But it cost me $175 to have a plumber come out this morning and fix it.
10231056	10237479	Um, F you to people that you thought were great friends that seem to disappear off the face of the planet altogether.
10237499	10246723	Um, you know, it just kind of sucks, like, to be felt like sometimes you're being dropped like a hot potato, uh, in, I don't know, for whatever reason.
10247383	10248924	So, it just kind of stinks, you know.
10249644	10251625	Friends are supposed to stick by each other through thick and thin.
10252345	10253906	Sometimes I get the feeling that's not happening.
10254106	10255347	So, F you to, uh...
10256247	10257808	Those general feelings of angst.
10258488	10259368	I hope it's all in my head.
10259508	10260188	That's all I'm saying.
10261849	10262149	All right.
10265010	10267571	Let's move on towards the end of the program here.
10267891	10269992	I think we want to get into the rapid fire news tonight.
10270372	10276214	So just kind of going over some of the stories we didn't talk about more in depth, but things you might want to know about anyway.
10276254	10279035	DarkSakura, you want to start us off with your share of rapid fire news tonight?
10279727	10290377	Well, we've just had Green Day sign up for Rock Band, so we'll have 21 Guns, Know Your Enemy, East Jesus Nowhere from 21st Century Breakdown, which was not really a good album.
10291698	10295963	Then we have Sam & Max 1 coming to Xbox Live for 1600 Microsoft Points.
10298705	10300107	Good, more people will try it now.
10300834	10302014	Yep.
10302094	10307196	Also, World of Warcraft is slashing mount requirements so that you can get them at level 20.
10308596	10310997	And epic mounts will be available at 40, flying mounts at 60.
10312177	10312717	Whoopty shit.
10314358	10320939	And then the new Zelda game, which there's not a whole bunch out on, though they're saying that it should include the Motion Plus.
10322240	10327001	Actually, sorry, that it may require you to have the Motion Plus.
10329488	10332629	Marissa Congusto in chat is actually commenting on the Green Day story.
10332649	10336031	Green Day rock band, most of their songs are only three chords.
10336651	10340433	Well, you know, that would work, though, because the easy mode, you only have three buttons, right?
10340513	10342514	So I guess they could just kind of line it up there.
10343234	10343734	Yeah.
10343775	10344655	Loki, Rapid Fire News.
10345057	10354641	Alright, so apparently Target is now offering gift cards with select MotionPlus games and Guitar Hero Smash Hits.
10355281	10360043	Apparently if you, an ad that they had running, I guess the week of June 14th,
10361764	10373357	It's showing that if you buy Tiger Woods PGA Tour 2010, and that's with Motion Plus, and Grand Slam Tennis, you will receive a $20 Target gift card.
10373817	10379103	If you happen to buy Guitar Hero Smash Hits, you get a $5 gift card.
10379183	10380024	So hey, that's cool, $5.
10381705	10389449	Rock Band is getting some music this week with Spinal Tap and Evanescence.
10390089	10395012	From Spinal Tap, the track pack is going to cost you $7 or 560 Microsoft Points.
10395812	10401255	That includes Back from the Dead, Rock and Roll Nightmare, Saucy Jack, and Warmer Than Hell.
10401915	10405757	Each of those can be purchased for $2 separately or 160 Microsoft Points.
10406657	10407998	Evanescence pack is going to be $4.
10408818	10421374	440 Microsoft Points or $5.50 and that includes Bring Me to Life, Call Me When You're Sober and Way to the World and of course each of those can be purchased for $2 separately or 160 Microsoft Points
10424216	10427077	EA has confirmed that a small team is working on Mirror's Edge 2.
10427977	10428698	Big duh.
10428758	10431299	Sequel for a game that was pretty fun.
10431539	10433199	Is that going to be the name of the game?
10433239	10433859	Mirror's Edge 2.
10434380	10435180	Big duh.
10436200	10441142	So, no surprise they're working on a sequel to a successful...
10442728	10443989	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
10461568	10462850	that was behind it.
10462990	10467955	They will be running the game I guess for a little longer so if you are in the middle of the game you can actually finish it.
10468395	10475783	But if you don't care to wait for that I think the PlayStation blog has all the information as far as what's going on there.
10476084	10477966	So check it out if you want to spoil it.
10480749	10481049	Alright.
10482069	10486790	Well, before we wrap up the show, we are going to open up the skyline and take your calls.
10486830	10492291	But first, we didn't get to the classic game of the week in Part A. We've got to get that taken care of tonight.
10492711	10495631	It just wouldn't be a week here at Orange Lounge Radio without the classic game of the week.
10495992	10502093	So every week, DarkSakura likes to dig through the great archive of gaming and pull out a game that you people ought to be playing.
10502453	10504353	It's the classic game of the week, and here it is.
10508074	10509254	What should the kids be playing this week?
10509693	10510534	Donkey Kong Jr.
10511835	10512355	Seriously.
10513676	10515417	It is seriously a classic game.
10515738	10522503	It's one where Donkey Kong's little kid wearing a diaper has to go rescue Donkey Kong from Mario who has captured him.
10523628	10538374	and basically you just climb on ropes and drop fruit on these mechanized little big mouth trap thingy thingies and then you have an electrical stage in different areas and it's actually supposed to be the guy
10542836	10548481	Um, Steve Wiebe, um, had the highest score on this one, actually, and he did pass Billy Mitchell on this.
10549763	10551184	So... The untold story.
10551605	10556109	Yeah, I don't know that Billy Mitchell has surpassed it, actually, since then.
10556430	10560134	Um, his, uh, score was 1,033,000 points, and Steve Wiebe got 1,001,039,800 points.
10565819	10568000	I have this on several systems like the NES.
10568100	10569461	There's actually a Game & Watch version.
10571482	10573503	The NES version was the launch title in Japan.
10573583	10575604	We've got it on a virtual console.
10576184	10577365	There was an e-reader card.
10577425	10578585	It was in Animal Crossing.
10578705	10580486	So yeah, it's a pretty classic.
10582727	10584908	This is one of the few Nintendo games I actually had.
10585509	10590031	There was a combo pack that came out on the NES back in the day that was like both Donkey Kong Jr.
10590051	10591191	games, and I had that actually.
10591211	10592552	It was one of the first Nintendo games I had.
10593052	10594393	So, that's cool.
10596068	10597048	I play this on the Coleco.
10597729	10597989	Yeah?
10598529	10598989	It's old school.
10599230	10599510	You know what?
10599610	10602111	I actually kind of like this game better a little bit than Donkey Kong.
10602152	10602572	I don't know why.
10602592	10610197	I guess I just like the whole concept of the vine climbing and that you kind of go faster if you're willing to go across two, but you go really fast when you slide down.
10610657	10611217	It's interesting.
10613019	10619443	Alright, if nothing else to say on this game from DarkSakura, then that's going to do it for your classic game of the week, Donkey Kong Jr.
10619943	10624126	on just about every freaking system ever made, but originally in the arcade.
10626010	10627470	An old school Nintendo classic.
10627530	10628071	There you have it.
10628771	10633412	Alright, we are going to open up the Skype line just a little bit for any open bar topics you guys have.
10633432	10637713	1-877-GAME-OLR or username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
10638073	10639293	Anything goes right now.
10639393	10648375	Anything you want to ask or comment on, whether we've talked about it in the show or it's something you think we should have covered that we didn't, now is the time.
10649255	10651336	Loki, I don't know if... Oh wait, never mind, we're getting a call right now.
10652682	10653542	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
10653562	10653883	Who's this?
10654663	10659425	Hey, it's your local convention whore, DJ Ranma S. Hey, Ranma, are you calling in about a new convention tonight?
10660105	10661065	Yeah, pretty much.
10661566	10661946	Of course.
10662026	10662786	Well, which convention?
10663907	10664667	Anime Next.
10665007	10665507	And how was it?
10667128	10667408	Well...
10668010	10675893	If you've been following my Twitter blog, I've been like not feeling it, not feeling it because there's been delays, guests canceling.
10675913	10681495	But when I got there and got into the groove of things, it was fun and I really enjoyed myself this year.
10681815	10682556	I have to be honest.
10682576	10684016	I've kind of been off Twitter all weekend.
10684036	10687438	I've been so busy just running from place to place doing – well, it's nice.
10687778	10690619	I can't – it's nice having a social life.
10691039	10692540	But yeah, I've just been so busy.
10692800	10693660	I've kind of been off Twitter.
10694640	10695201	But I don't –
10696121	10724906	I know what you mean you know sometimes you're just kind of not in the mood but then you get there and it somehow all comes together like haven't you ever done that like there's been like a party and you don't really want to go but maybe there's like either a significant other or it's an important friend having the party or something you know yeah and you're just not feeling it but you're like all right I'm gonna go because I have to and maybe I'll stay for an hour then find an excuse to leave like I have severe diarrhea or something right but then you get there and you're like oh I'm actually having a good time and it just kind of seems to all come together like that
10725953	10727274	Yeah, that's how it was.
10727854	10728054	Yeah.
10729114	10729635	So, all right.
10729775	10734857	Well, what about, you know, we're a gaming show, so I always have to ask you, how was gaming representation at the con?
10735397	10736217	Was there good stuff there?
10737598	10738598	Yeah.
10738678	10741219	First of all, they had a room just for a rock band.
10741879	10747142	They had it projected onto a large wall, which was about 60 feet wide, pretty much.
10747182	10747322	Mm-hmm.
10751363	10754366	It was a dark room and I walked in and everybody was singing Living on a Prayer.
10756147	10760531	Is this rock band room something where people would just randomly walk in and watch people play rock band?
10761712	10766856	Yeah, I mean you would wait your turn to play but at the same time there was chairs so we could sit down and watch them play.
10767476	10769538	I bet you see a lot of great talent though.
10770459	10771400	Yes, definitely.
10772741	10774282	Sort of like an anime idol.
10775343	10780087	Something like that and also there was also a beta test for DJ Hero there.
10781189	10781809	Oh, really?
10782469	10783149	Yeah, really.
10783850	10786030	So, wait, so you actually got to play DJ Hero?
10786730	10788471	Yeah, it's called Beatmania 2DX.
10790391	10791731	Ba-dum-bum, nice.
10792371	10793772	Wait, hold on, though, Ranma.
10794472	10797672	As I said this in Part A, the games have nothing in common.
10797913	10798553	They really don't.
10798593	10801373	If you've got to make that comparison, Beatmania and Scratch.
10801793	10803754	But Beatmania and DJ Hero, no.
10804214	10804974	It doesn't work.
10805134	10808295	There are two games that happen to use a turntable.
10808855	10809635	They're so different.
10810567	10821598	Here's the thing though, I wasn't the one that made the joke because I walked in, I saw the sign, I run over to the other side of the game room because I know one of the guys over there, I'm like, what's up with DJ Hero?
10821618	10824120	He's like, no, it's 2DX dude, it's 2DX.
10824160	10825962	I'm like, haha, funny.
10826643	10827984	Oh, so they made the joke?
10828485	10828845	Uh-huh.
10828965	10832829	Well, please encourage them to go listen to Part A tonight because I have some pretty strong words for them.
10833820	10840328	I will, I definitely will alright Ranma, I gotta let you go to get more calls but thanks so much for your call and have fun on the anime circuit you got it
10843654	10847676	Let's see, I'm looking at, because the chat room is talking about Anime Next a little bit here.
10848236	10853118	Legend of Zaku says, Anime Next was pretty damn lackluster compared to previous years, although the venue kicked ass this year.
10853838	10856559	Osfer says, I can't wait until mid-July when I go to Otacon.
10857160	10861001	And Rob D is pimping his panel called Games That Push Your Buttons.
10861061	10863142	It is pretty funny, though, if you're going to Otacon, check that out.
10863702	10864883	Hi, you're on Orange Haunts Radio, who's this?
10864903	10866343	Legend of Zaku.
10866503	10868324	Zaku, I was just reading a comment of yours.
10868384	10870305	Is this a call about Anime Next, or what?
10870854	10872214	Yeah, I was there that weekend.
10872534	10872674	And?
10872954	10879216	Even though I didn't room with Adam this year, but I managed to find enough cash to go and split a room with someone else.
10880076	10885217	Even though it wasn't far from the venue, but I still managed to make it regardless.
10888077	10893358	Just to touch up on what he briefly said, I kind of had a different experience this year in Anime Next.
10893378	10895679	I mean, the venue kicked severe ass.
10896667	10897428	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
10912501	10914963	I'd have been, you know, wasn't what I expected, but whatever.
10914983	10917504	I guess we'll try for the next year.
10917564	10918865	What was missing for you?
10919005	10921126	Was the game room lacking or what?
10921527	10922847	No, the game room was fine.
10922907	10924448	That had nothing to do with it.
10924468	10929291	It's just like, it wasn't, I don't know, for some reason, I wasn't really getting into some of the other panels.
10929611	10929912	I see.
10930072	10936856	Like, when I first went to Anime Next two years ago, I was really getting into an Adult Swim panel that I got in there and maybe a couple of Anime...
10937813	10940655	But I wasn't feeling it this year, unfortunately.
10965294	10969616	Do not let your friend host a panel because they are your friend.
10969936	10976178	Unless that friend is able to produce and outline ideas like everyone should have to, knock it off.
10976318	10977538	You're ruining your own con.
10978839	10984061	There was a particular one that I wanted to go to, but it had to do with Bomani stuff.
10984581	10990523	It was actually on Friday, but by the time I made it there, I had to take my roommate to the hotel and check it in.
10991161	10994927	and GetFood, so I pretty much missed it by the time I got there.
10995107	10997170	What exactly are those Bomani panels like these days?
10997370	10998212	Damn, we're in trouble.
10998232	11006444	I have no idea, but it was held on Friday evening, and I managed to arrive in the con at that time to get my badge, so it was a new award then.
11006584	11010546	They were nice enough to let me sit in on the BomaniStyle.com panel at ASEN.
11010606	11015830	And, you know, as cool as it was to be sitting with some of those folks, I really didn't feel like there was a lot to talk about.
11016090	11022734	A lot of the discussions focused around the concert that had happened the night before, which is cool for the folks that are into that type of music.
11022814	11025736	I felt really lost or what have you because I haven't been following a lot of the new Bomani games.
11026016	11029098	But when it came to actual talk on the Bomani games, like half of it was a joke.
11030058	11030498	Right.
11030739	11030979	Anyway.
11031039	11032900	Most of it, for, you know, I...
11033280	11043274	Even though I wasn't actually there in Ace, and I could only imagine it's probably like insider info, probably like inside jokes, something that would... A lot of inside jokes.
11043695	11045417	You had it anyways a minute ago, Zaku.
11045457	11046899	Please go ahead with your anyways.
11047780	11048842	Anyways, I would...
11051028	11064740	DDRX apparently hit arcades last week, the first one being Gameworks in Chicago that managed to get the first new cabinet in the country.
11065681	11068543	And from the initial reviews, horrible.
11069888	11083914	Let's just put it this way, the fact that the cabinet itself managed to go down to $10,000 as opposed to $15,000 in previous releases, they pretty much cut many corners, noticeable corners.
11085115	11095579	Laggy LCD monitor, a pad that's like half the thickness of the original one, the sensors in the arrows are pretty much
11096841	11101462	They're just triggering or not even holding, just triggering spontaneously or not holding at all.
11102082	11110244	Just a lot of bullshit on the part of maybe Betzen or Konami for that matter, just producing piss for new cabinets.
11110844	11111404	You know what?
11111924	11112865	I'm not surprised.
11112985	11114205	Go back to last week's show.
11114285	11117606	As far as I'm concerned, wheel that machine out to the barn and put a bullet in it.
11117666	11118086	It's done.
11119626	11124027	Yeah, at this point, people are just writing DDRX off at this point.
11124648	11125309	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
11142492	11143693	I'm sadly not surprised.
11143993	11147134	Zaku, we gotta let you go so we can wrap up the show, but thanks so much for calling in.
11147375	11147995	Alright, take care.
11148175	11151317	They're a little fatter, too, and nobody likes fat.
11151637	11156019	Is it just me, or does it sound like, and we're gonna turn off the Skype for tonight so we can wrap up the show, but thank you guys so much.
11156039	11159601	And if you didn't get in, remember, you can always send us an email, mailbag at orangelaundry.com.
11159621	11160682	We do want your voice to be heard.
11161682	11162703	Thanks for watching!
11183772	11186434	Thought I would say this seven years ago when this whole show started.
11186494	11190577	And yes, we're coming up on our seven-year anniversary show in two weeks, believe it or not.
11191478	11193260	This first show is June 23, 2002.
11194601	11200245	I never thought I would say this seven years ago, but we've talked too much about DDR the past two shows.
11201246	11204008	Like, that's how relevant it is right now in this world.
11204048	11205109	We could bring it back.
11205329	11206070	I could bring it back.
11206110	11207811	They just didn't put the confidence in me.
11207831	11209813	No, it's not going to happen.
11209833	11210453	No, it would happen.
11210473	11211034	Sorry, Loki.
11211654	11211934	It would.
11211994	11212415	It would.
11212975	11213695	But it's not going to.
11213715	11214156	It could.
11214236	11214816	Yes, it could.
11215676	11215936	All right.
11216297	11221459	We've got to go around and get everybody's final thought and wrap up the show tonight and take care of it.
11221519	11223500	Oh, did you have any other last things you want to throw out there?
11223520	11224601	We didn't even talk release dates.
11225141	11225641	Oh, my God.
11225681	11226021	We didn't.
11226041	11227522	Do we want to go over those real quick?
11227782	11228343	We could do that.
11228603	11231524	That's what happens when you try a new format is that you forget shit.
11231584	11231824	All right.
11231844	11234706	Well, then, Loki, why don't you go over some release dates for the U.S.
11234746	11235366	before we wrap it up?
11235586	11249673	Alright, well this week we've got quite a few games coming out, but some that you probably want to pick up, Ghostbusters, coming out on PlayStation 2, 3, Xbox 360, Wii, DS, and PS, maybe the PSP, yeah.
11250955	11253037	That's right, not the PSP.
11253797	11254578	Let's see.
11254798	11258100	Big League Sports Summer coming out on Wii and DS.
11258600	11267686	Flower, Sun, and Rain, if you're a fan of the Killer7 and those types of games, but Grasshopper doing this one on DS.
11268146	11269026	It's weird.
11269107	11272929	I actually played the import of the European one, and it's kind of weird.
11273769	11276971	Guitar Hero Smash Hits coming out on PlayStation 2, 3, Xbox 360, and the Wii.
11280113	11298591	um if you're into more of the sim games Discovery Kids Parrot Pals and Diva Girls Divas on Ice on Wii and the DS um Monster Hunter Freedom Unite on PSP that's gonna be pretty awesome and that's pretty much it
11299926	11307613	Japan's looking a little thin on the releases this week, but you do get a price drop on Metal Gear Solid 4 Guns of the Patriots on June 18th on the PlayStation 3.
11307993	11310615	Remember, this is Japanese release dates I am reading right now.
11311616	11314979	Sometimes they get cool stuff before we do, but right now they're not getting a lot.
11314999	11318342	There isn't a single thing of note coming out on the Wii this week, believe it or not.
11318422	11321865	And usually in Japan, even on a slow week, you have something coming out on the Wii this
11322185	11344495	on the Playstation 2 you have a couple other price drops going on and mostly they are Neo Geo games like King of Fighters, Maximum Impact, Regulation A Metal Slug Complete, Samurai Spirits all of those games are getting price reductions and perhaps this is in preparation for the Sunsoft collection which is also coming out I think that's actually another price drop though they all get price drop, price drop, price drop this week over in Japan
11345135	11347657	On the Nintendo DS, there is a Go!
11347677	11347857	Go!
11348397	11349558	13 game coming out, believe it or not.
11349578	11350058	Remember that?
11350438	11351999	That was an old-school anime game that was on the NES.
11352019	11353220	I remember we could make a moonwalk.
11353280	11353660	That was funny.
11353680	11354001	That's right.
11354241	11361925	They have a new one of those games coming out on the DS this week, as well as Nippon Golfers Kentai DS comes out as well, and some games from Level 5.
11361965	11371791	I'm not sure exactly if these are games we know over here, but Tago Akira no Atama no Taisu, Dai Wanshu, Nazotoki Sekai Isshu Ryoku comes out this week.
11371851	11372712	I heard head.
11372732	11372852	Head.
11373872	11382494	I think this is... It looks like some type of... You play in a hotel?
11382594	11383315	Pirate ships?
11384795	11388096	Pirate ship hotel.
11388116	11389696	Looks like you're in a hotel or something.
11389976	11391837	DarkSakura's going to take a look at the name here.
11391877	11392637	Professor Layton.
11394457	11394697	Oh!
11394957	11395677	Yeah, see?
11396258	11397338	Leighton Kojo.
11397358	11398639	Oh, okay.
11398699	11399960	It's Professor Leighton Games.
11400080	11401020	New ones in Japan.
11401040	11401401	There's two.
11401501	11402281	Volume 1 and Volume 2.
11402321	11402521	Yeah.
11404102	11405103	Okay, now I see it.
11405123	11408505	Because you were clicking on the pictures for the Leighton games.
11408805	11409605	Oh, now I see it.
11409745	11410005	Okay.
11410105	11410986	It's brain training.
11411526	11412127	Yep, yep.
11412647	11412887	All right.
11414721	11417964	There you go, new Professor Layton games coming out on DS over there in Japan.
11418585	11426753	And quickly looking at the PSP, Fate Unlimited Codes Portable comes out this week from Capcom on the PSP.
11428649	11430550	Dan is making arrangements for us, potentially.
11456107	11458289	Yeah, I'm hearing we might move to where the pinball machines are now.
11458529	11459710	He was giving me a little tour earlier.
11459730	11461412	Yeah, the pinballs have to go to the garage.
11461432	11463013	We might bump the pinball machines for the show.
11463073	11463634	Could be interesting.
11464875	11468378	But we did trade creatures from the Black Lagoon for Lord of the Rings.
11469179	11470520	And Tan broke it already.
11470660	11472262	I miss not having to commute, but...
11473542	11476263	I guess if you guys have done it for so long I can do it for a little while at least.
11477864	11479564	How about our European releases?
11479644	11480185	How about it?
11480685	11484626	On the 16th we have Wallace and Gromit's Grand Adventures Muzzled for PC.
11485867	11489068	And on the 17th we have Rocket Riot, which kind of sounds a little dirty to me.
11490028	11491929	The 18th Metal Gear Solid on PlayStation 3.
11493030	11496431	And then the 19th we have Rock Band Unplugged, Virtua Tennis 2009, and Ghostbusters.
11501038	11505620	Ghostbusters by the way I really like that infamous game really?
11506000	11530370	yeah somebody was just asking a little while ago why we don't talk about it on the show I haven't played much of it just because I've had a whole lot going on you know but it's totally like between the guy coasting through the air with electricity and then being Spiderman it's kind of funny meets the guy from Crackdown I'm glad you said something about it I hope the listener who sent in that email listens to the end of the show so there you go
11531380	11533541	All right, Loki, you had some other stories you wanted to get to.
11533861	11534161	Yes.
11534961	11541782	Well, what game out there could possibly create a peripheral that is 20 times more expensive than the game itself?
11542223	11544503	Well, that game, of course, would be Virtualon.
11545243	11551585	They do have a $300 arcade stick that you can get for the Xbox 360 version.
11551645	11556226	It is from Hori, and yes, it is 20 times the cost of the game, which is only $15.
11557426	11582912	but it does have the twin sticks and you can go crazy with that I wonder if you know how they have those little converter units where you could use like a Playstation controller on the Xbox 360 you know the different ones you'd have to remap them and everything I wonder if there wouldn't be some type of converter that they could make where I could use my Dreamcast sticks I don't know then again I can just play it on Dreamcast
11584400	11586583	This is going to sound so random, but I have to say something.
11586743	11590628	I just realized you're wearing a DDRspot.com shirt.
11590789	11591510	Yes, I am.
11591550	11593092	That is fucking old school.
11593773	11594914	You know when I got this shirt?
11595836	11596096	Yeah.
11596196	11599300	I got this shirt at March Madness.
11599320	11601023	That shirt has to be as old as this show.
11603161	11614680	I threw away the other day my DDR Mania X shirt I still have two DDR Freak shirts left too But now keep in mind, this is the thing, remember when I got this, it fit me?
11616169	11617890	This is a 2XL.
11617971	11619031	It's pajamas now.
11619131	11620332	That's a sleepy shirt now.
11620813	11621073	Yeah.
11621333	11621934	Well, good for you.
11622454	11625937	It's a shirt I can wear without a bra.
11626818	11628559	Well, thanks for sharing.
11629400	11630220	Okay, Loki, sorry.
11630460	11636365	Well, with the news of Left 4 Dead 2 possibly dividing the community, maybe this will bring the community back together.
11637346	11641629	Left 4 Dead has finally got a nude Zoe mod for PC version.
11641729	11642550	Yes, that's right.
11642570	11643331	I read that.
11644221	11647923	What game out there with a female character would not be complete without a nude mod?
11648203	11650084	I think we can all agree on that.
11650144	11652085	The nudity mods are a must.
11652485	11656087	And that's available on L4Dmods.com.
11656927	11658808	I gotta love this stuff.
11659389	11660549	Nudity brings us together.
11661029	11661270	Yes.
11662890	11663611	Let's see here.
11664951	11665592	Apparently...
11668456	11690269	Final Fantasy Tactics has been rated by the ESRB and people believe it's coming to the PlayStation Network sounds about right to me nice holy crap nice I've been so jonesing for the old school Final Fantasy Tactics like before it was on DS and all the other ones I really want to play like on my TV again Final Fantasy Tactics oh happy happy Rob
11691394	11692815	PSP GO Apps and Small Games at Gamescom
11711369	11737259	and these are supposed to be of course non-retail games and applications for the PSP and the file sizes are said to be limited to 100 megabytes but developers and publishers won't be limited in other creative ways Sony is said to have some specifically stated non-game apps and 2D tiles are more than welcome make your comparisons to iPhone now yes
11741966	11748893	I don't want to report on this, but apparently there is another teaser site in Japan now for a brand new Tingle game.
11750094	11752216	And I weep with sadness.
11753958	11755079	I weep tears of joy.
11755380	11756681	Thank you for reporting that, Loki.
11756701	11758703	Alright, is that it?
11759271	11773645	And finally, Nintendo apparently has, according to Guardian Media Technologies, was one of the patent lawsuits that Nintendo had to deal with.
11774185	11775346	Well, it's been thrown out of court.
11776628	11789646	We are very pleased with the court's decision and Nintendo vigorously defends its patent lawsuits and at the earliest stages of this case Nintendo convinced the court to dismiss the case as Guardian's patent had nothing to do with Nintendo's products.
11790612	11794534	Well, despite all the crap I give Nintendo, I think I agree with them here.
11794554	11796175	There's too many of these frivolous patent lawsuits.
11796195	11797055	Well, here's the thing.
11797155	11806860	If there's a patent lawsuit that's out there, and they find that they have infringed on that patent, then how could there be multiple lawsuits later on for the same types of things?
11807120	11815844	Because I think in that case, well, you've already found that you've been infringing on this patent, and you need to go after that person, because that's the person that has the patent for it, not Nintendo.
11816744	11817325	And that's it.
11818891	11819151	All right.
11819471	11821972	Well, that's going to do it here for another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
11822632	11824013	We need to get everybody's final thought.
11824253	11825773	My God, the show just keeps going tonight.
11826094	11827014	Three hours and counting.
11827894	11829035	Loki, your final thought tonight.
11829215	11832956	I'm going to have to play some more Fuel, and then I'll have to play with you online with Fuel.
11833556	11835417	My final thought is I am so down.
11835457	11836117	Just let me know when.
11836137	11836637	That'll be fun.
11836757	11837017	All right.
11837237	11837718	Dark Sakura.
11838058	11842179	I don't think a miracle from God could make Star Trek V a good movie.
11845040	11847241	You do know they're on Star Trek X at this point, right?
11847702	11854019	I know, but I was going back and reading 20 facts about Star Trek 10 from TrekMovie.com, which I will post in chat.
11855322	11856746	Hey, but it did have the fan dance.
11857501	11859883	Anyhow, that's going to do it for another week here at Orange Lounge Radio.
11859923	11866627	Hey, if you like what we do here for free every week of the last seven years of our lives, all we ask, tell a couple people about the show.
11866928	11867768	Help spread the word.
11867848	11869349	It's word of mouth that keeps us alive.
11869730	11872031	Thank you guys so much for tuning into us and supporting us.
11872491	11878155	And we'll see you back here next week with more of Orange Lounge Radio and back here in two weeks for our seventh anniversary.
11878195	11882418	And I don't know if we're doing anything special for the seventh anniversary because the planning would have been... Is it really?
11882698	11884240	Two weeks is our seventh anniversary.
11885060	11888302	to technically it falls in between next week and the next Sunday.
11888742	11889462	But you know what?
11890963	11892844	I have my next assessment.
11893904	11894184	You know what?
11894204	11898426	I'm going to actually email the teacher and ask if I can go do the assessment earlier in the day.
11898866	11899607	That might be a good idea.
11900787	11902068	I don't know if we'll do anything special.
11902128	11906450	It's just, you know, we always try to do something special for the anniversary shows and nothing ever really happens.
11906470	11906950	Let's explode things.
11907390	11907650	All right.
11907710	11909291	We want to explode things live on air and be fun.
11910259	11911799	Alright, well we'll see what happens.
11912099	11914960	We'll be back next week with more Orange Lounge Radio.
