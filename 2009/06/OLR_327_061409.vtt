00:00.000 --> 00:20.240
Today, June 14th, 2009. Could you soon use a turntable in Guitar Hero? Is Project Natal

00:20.240 --> 00:24.960
actually a new Xbox console? And if one creator has his way, what video game might be the

00:24.960 --> 00:33.880
next great sport? Orange Lounge Radio. Hello, everybody out there on the Internet, and welcome

00:33.880 --> 00:42.480
to another week of Orange Lounge Radio, taping June the 14th, 2009. My name is Rob Roberts.

00:42.480 --> 00:46.440
Joining me not tonight is the one and only Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers. She's actually

00:46.440 --> 00:51.340
around. She didn't go on a vacation or anything, but she had school orientation some tonight

00:51.340 --> 00:55.960
for her class, or I don't know what all's going on there, but I know she's school-related.

00:55.960 --> 01:00.440
She'll be joining us partway through the show, hopefully. She's anticipating she'll be here

01:00.440 --> 01:06.120
about 8.15 Pacific, which usually our show's still taping by 8.30, 8.45, so she should

01:06.120 --> 01:10.400
be here for the very, very end. But that's all right. We've still got Tech Master Loki

01:10.400 --> 01:16.160
here tonight. Yes, I'm here. The very busy Tech Master Loki. Yes, I'm moving. Yes, you've

01:16.160 --> 01:23.000
been moving lately. How's that going? Sucks. Yeah? Yeah. But I don't know if the listeners

01:23.000 --> 01:27.680
are aware, but you actually moved from an apartment to your house. Not a rented house,

01:27.680 --> 01:32.160
but one you have actually purchased. Yes. In this very sad economy, you were actually

01:32.160 --> 01:37.800
able to make it work. Someone else's misfortune turned into your gain. Thank you, Fannie Mae.

01:37.800 --> 01:44.160
No, seriously, they had a really kick-ass loan deal, got like a really low interest

01:44.160 --> 01:50.440
rate, and normally, buyers like us, because we're not putting down a lot of money, you

01:50.440 --> 01:56.280
would have to pay mortgage insurance, which that raises your monthly payments by a couple

01:56.280 --> 02:00.320
hundred dollars, which would price it out of range. However, they gave us a special

02:00.320 --> 02:05.640
deal where we didn't have to have mortgage insurance, so we didn't. So it ends up now

02:05.640 --> 02:12.200
our house payments are really about $60 more than what our apartment was. We're like, okay.

02:12.200 --> 02:16.680
That's great. Wow. We can do that. I'm a little jealous, but see, I'm not married. I don't

02:16.680 --> 02:20.440
have someone to share that type of income with. People say you can get a roommate and

02:20.440 --> 02:23.980
so on and so on to make it work, but I just don't. It would be tough. It would be tough,

02:23.980 --> 02:27.960
because what happens if you can't find one? That's the situation I find myself in. Or

02:27.960 --> 02:32.880
if they leave, it would just be difficult. Our old buddy, Bobby Black Wolf, who tapes

02:32.880 --> 02:36.880
before us live on Sunday nights at All Games Radio, where we start at six o'clock Pacific

02:36.880 --> 02:41.320
but he starts at five o'clock Pacific, is in our chat room at chat.orangelaunchradio.com.

02:41.320 --> 02:45.260
How much did I plug in that one sentence? He says, hey, I'm buying my first house this

02:45.260 --> 02:48.960
summer too. I just got pre-approved for a mortgage. Congratulations. It's a good time

02:48.960 --> 02:54.240
to do it, because that government program where you get eight grand back in your taxes

02:54.240 --> 02:59.480
next year, that's putting a new roof on our house. Nice. That'd be awesome. Quick, anyone

02:59.480 --> 03:06.560
want to get married? Buy a house with me? No, I'm just kidding. Oh my gosh. It's definitely

03:06.560 --> 03:11.240
a time to buy. Now, bringing it back to video games, since that's what our show is all about,

03:11.240 --> 03:16.240
is now your house. Are you doing anything special with the tech? I don't know necessarily

03:16.240 --> 03:20.280
the games, because I know the wife is not a fan of games not called Excite Truck or

03:20.280 --> 03:24.200
Bejeweled, but I know you were talking about something tech that you're doing with the

03:24.200 --> 03:28.720
babies that are coming soon. We may do, like, I was thinking it would be cool to do video

03:28.720 --> 03:34.600
monitors, because usually how you do a baby monitor that's audio or something like that.

03:34.600 --> 03:40.600
But they had a commercial that I saw on TV, or like Home Depot or something like that,

03:40.600 --> 03:45.520
where some guy was doing a project where he had video monitoring for their babies. But

03:45.520 --> 03:50.400
having two of those, and we can do picture in picture on TV while we're watching TV and

03:50.400 --> 03:54.240
stuff, you can see the two babies there. I don't know. That would probably be really

03:54.240 --> 04:01.760
expensive and a lot of work for something that's kind of neat. But we'll see. Mainly

04:01.760 --> 04:07.160
network stuff I'm going to have to run a bunch of networking stuff through our attic, because

04:07.160 --> 04:14.840
I can't stretch a 50-foot Cat 5 cable anymore. It's going to be interesting to see how your

04:14.840 --> 04:19.400
stories change once those babies are born. I'm very curious to see what's going to change

04:19.400 --> 04:23.720
in the house of Loki. We'll see. Alright, but congratulations on the house. That's something

04:23.720 --> 04:27.400
else. Thank you. I helped him move into it Saturday, because that's what friends do.

04:27.400 --> 04:34.520
And it's a nice house. It's very similar to the one I rent, but I only rent it. You know,

04:34.520 --> 04:38.240
with the hardwood floors, and the one bathroom and three bedrooms, and the bedrooms are a

04:38.240 --> 04:46.760
little small. I have to put in those floors. Yeah, they're laminate. It's a particle board.

04:46.760 --> 04:51.640
It's kind of like this desk. More comments from chat.orangelaunchradio.com. If you're

04:51.640 --> 04:55.600
listening to us on All Games Radio Live on this Sunday night, please join us. Say hello.

04:55.600 --> 05:00.320
Deekman says, you stream it. Or too creepy. I think that's a little too creepy. That'd

05:00.320 --> 05:07.800
be boring. Who would watch baby monitors on YouTube? Well, I guess you'd be surprised.

05:07.800 --> 05:14.840
And Toshan says, Loki, my neighbor has a video baby monitor. I could get info. I'm sure it's

05:14.840 --> 05:19.680
easy to do, because it's just, I think it's just video. You probably wouldn't do audio.

05:19.680 --> 05:24.600
And so it'd basically just be running the video line through the ceiling to wherever

05:24.600 --> 05:29.160
you're going to watch it, I guess. Or they may even have it, you know, Wi-Fi, which would

05:29.160 --> 05:33.760
make things even easier. They wouldn't have to run anything. Deekman in chat says, Loki,

05:33.760 --> 05:38.540
get the angel care baby monitors. It beeps if the baby doesn't move. So it's advice from

05:38.540 --> 05:43.400
another parent, because I know Deekman. Is that like the, what was it, everything's okay

05:43.400 --> 05:51.680
alarm? Beep. Beep's not moving. That's scary stuff, though. But wow. All right. SSJ100Matt

05:51.680 --> 05:55.200
says, I can think of a few people here who would watch it. That's a little creepy. I'm

05:55.200 --> 06:01.760
sorry. Why would you be watching that when you can play games? Like doing it for a minute

06:01.760 --> 06:07.920
to go, aw, how cute. I'll just put pictures up. It's like watching the kitty, like tons

06:07.920 --> 06:12.220
of people on Justin TV do this, have the kitties on Justin TV. Like you'll watch it for a minute

06:12.220 --> 06:16.560
and go, aw, it's cute. But like if you're watching it for like hours at a time, like

06:16.560 --> 06:19.880
seriously, you need to just adopt a cat. There's many cats out there that could use a good

06:19.880 --> 06:26.720
home. Yeah. Our cat did not like moving. But that's pretty cool that you have like, you

06:26.720 --> 06:29.320
know, that we've been doing this show long enough and we have such an awesome listener

06:29.320 --> 06:36.000
base that essentially the listeners are offing to babysit your children via Ustream. Well,

06:36.000 --> 06:42.800
I don't know, that's. I know, it's not, it's no substitute for the real thing. All right.

06:42.800 --> 06:46.440
We're going to get into our gaming weeks and talk about how is your gaming week. And you

06:46.440 --> 06:49.240
know, if there was something you played at E3 that we didn't get to last week, because

06:49.240 --> 06:52.160
I know there's a couple games I want to talk about tonight, feel free to get into that

06:52.160 --> 06:57.520
as well. How was your gaming week, Loki? Honestly, I don't remember anything I played at E3. Like

06:57.520 --> 07:04.240
people ask me, so what'd you play? Like, uh, stuff? No, I remember playing one thing I

07:04.240 --> 07:11.440
played at Sega, was it Sega Rally All Stars or I don't know. It's some sort of like Mario

07:11.440 --> 07:16.840
Kart with Sega characters game. And it was like Mario Kart with Sega characters game.

07:16.840 --> 07:22.600
You know what's weird though? Is they have like commentators, which is odd. I was not

07:22.600 --> 07:26.480
imagining commentators in that kind of game. Is that the game that's supposed to have like

07:26.480 --> 07:30.800
Greg Proops as a commentator? No, no, no. That's Mad World. That's awesome. Oh, that's

07:30.800 --> 07:37.320
right. Okay. That would be, that's already out. Why did I think that was a racing game?

07:37.320 --> 07:42.160
I don't know, but hey, they want to come back and do commentary in that game. You know,

07:42.160 --> 07:49.160
not changing up any of the language whatsoever. I might actually make that game good. No,

07:50.160 --> 07:54.600
so I played that. I think that was like kind of on Thursday when I was just like, eh, I

07:54.600 --> 07:57.560
don't know what I want to do, so I'm going to start playing some random games. I watch

07:57.560 --> 08:03.320
people play a lot of stuff, but I don't know. This week I actually played, you know, more

08:03.320 --> 08:13.760
Grand Theft Auto 4, because we play that every day. I played some Prototype, which is fun.

08:13.760 --> 08:20.760
It's really underwhelming as far as graphics go. I mean, it's very plain looking, but if

08:20.760 --> 08:23.880
you think about the developer of the game, they actually were the ones that did like

08:23.880 --> 08:29.880
the Hulk, the Ultimate Destruction stuff. It's very simple graphics, but it's the same

08:29.880 --> 08:35.800
type of gameplay where you can throw things in the stuff and just go crazy. You can absorb

08:35.800 --> 08:40.840
people and take their life to kind of boost your health and stuff like that. When you

08:40.840 --> 08:47.560
do that, it's just brutal. You'll just step on their face or knee them in the groin and

08:47.560 --> 08:54.360
they just absorb into your body. It's just weird, but it's absolutely bloody. Most games

08:54.360 --> 09:00.800
are just kind of that brown color. This is all red. It's just red everywhere, just blood.

09:00.800 --> 09:03.720
It's awesome, but I haven't really played too much of it.

09:03.720 --> 09:07.680
Yeah, the actual blood isn't that cartoony red. Like when you get a paper cut, it looks

09:07.680 --> 09:09.840
cartoony red, but real blood is like...

09:09.840 --> 09:14.560
No, people explode. It's just stained all over the street. I mean, it's just crazy.

09:14.560 --> 09:19.760
Unless it's over the top, which it sounds like it is. See, and we get into the topic

09:19.760 --> 09:24.080
we got into a few weeks ago, talking about Saw and that whole thing, where I can't watch

09:24.080 --> 09:27.920
the Saw movies because it's too real for me. But when the violence is over the top...

09:27.920 --> 09:28.920
Yeah, this is over the top.

09:28.920 --> 09:31.080
Okay, I think that stuff is funny.

09:31.080 --> 09:34.520
Like snapping people in half and stuff like that. It's just ridiculous.

09:34.520 --> 09:36.840
Mortal Kombat, over the top, always has been.

09:36.840 --> 09:41.740
You can grab somebody and just run into the ground with them. There was one that they

09:41.740 --> 09:46.520
had in a video where he grabs a soldier, slams down into a building, jumps up again, slams

09:46.520 --> 09:51.240
down to another building, keeps going down until he flies off the skyscraper, and then

09:51.240 --> 09:56.960
slams it into the ground. Plus, you can do sprinting. It'll automatically do the parkour

09:56.960 --> 10:02.120
stuff. So you can jump off buildings, running upside of buildings. Just absolutely crazy

10:02.120 --> 10:02.840
stuff.

10:02.840 --> 10:07.520
But being spoiled with games like Crackdown and stuff, where it actually looks pretty

10:07.520 --> 10:15.520
and does most of that stuff, really there's no excuse for that. But hey, who cares? It's

10:15.520 --> 10:19.560
fun. It's worth playing.

10:19.560 --> 10:24.240
The other game I tried to play this week, and really pissed me off because once I found

10:24.240 --> 10:30.080
out about this game, I'm like, oh, I gotta get this. Angry Berry, which is an XNA game.

10:30.080 --> 10:38.080
It's basically Obama the game, the fighting, it's like a Final Fight type game. It's absolutely

10:38.080 --> 10:44.840
ridiculous. The problem is it's broken on Xbox community games right now. You can download

10:44.840 --> 10:50.680
the game and it won't boot up at all, and you waste money, which sucks. But Angry Berry-

10:50.680 --> 10:52.960
Wait, don't these things have to go through like a-

10:52.960 --> 10:57.640
Yeah, they should, and it pissed me off because it was working, so apparently he updated something

10:57.640 --> 11:03.640
and it broke it. So now I paid for this and I can't play it, and it's really making me

11:03.640 --> 11:04.840
sad because-

11:04.840 --> 11:09.160
I'm actually looking at some footage of this here in studio off of YouTube.

11:09.160 --> 11:13.760
It's absolutely ridiculous. You can pick up- the first level, you're apparently fighting

11:13.760 --> 11:15.760
like old ladies, and then-

11:15.760 --> 11:20.800
Yeah, cat ladies in Central Park. On the start of his quest, Berry runs into a bunch of old

11:20.800 --> 11:24.600
dotties- went off the screen, let me roll it back a little bit- a bunch of old dotties

11:24.600 --> 11:29.680
who have a much different idea of who should rule the world. As he continues, Berry is

11:29.680 --> 11:34.480
haunted by a ghost from his past who may end his quest before it starts. And-

11:34.480 --> 11:38.280
So basically the game's kind of funny because he runs around and he can punch things and

11:38.280 --> 11:42.280
stuff like that, and he can punch people in the face, but he can also pick up stuff, like

11:42.280 --> 11:44.280
unrealistically, like, you know, the park bench.

11:44.280 --> 11:45.280
It just picked up a bench.

11:45.280 --> 11:50.280
Oh no, it gets better. It gets better. He can pick up people by their heads, and then

11:50.280 --> 11:55.280
he can also pick up, like, buses and stuff. It's just absolutely ridiculous. See, there-

11:55.280 --> 11:58.280
he picked up a jogger and he's like trying to smash people.

11:58.280 --> 12:03.280
Okay, but the- the caliber quality of this game looks like somewhere between NES and

12:03.280 --> 12:04.280
Super Nintendo.

12:04.280 --> 12:05.780
It's awesome, the way you can-

12:05.780 --> 12:09.280
Somebody's running by yelling, have my baby, Berry. That's, uh-

12:09.280 --> 12:14.280
Wait, wait, wait. Keep going until you get to the bus because that's hilarious.

12:14.280 --> 12:18.280
Let me fast forward a little ways here, if I can.

12:18.280 --> 12:22.280
He picked up the jogger.

12:22.280 --> 12:26.280
Part of me wonders if this is, like, really disrespectful. I don't know. There's the bus.

12:26.280 --> 12:29.280
This is awesome right here.

12:29.280 --> 12:31.280
Bunch of old ladies getting out of the bus.

12:31.280 --> 12:32.280
Old ladies and stuff.

12:32.280 --> 12:35.280
They just picked up the bus and started smashing old ladies.

12:35.280 --> 12:40.280
That's awesome. Right there. That was instant purchase for me. I'm like, I must buy this game.

12:40.280 --> 12:42.280
And I did, like, instantly.

12:42.280 --> 12:43.280
Problem was-

12:43.280 --> 12:46.280
But it doesn't work. Well then how come it works in this little demo I'm looking at on YouTube?

12:46.280 --> 12:49.280
I don't know, but there's a lot of people who have played it too.

12:49.280 --> 12:52.280
But for whatever reason it's broken now. I get a code 4 error.

12:52.280 --> 12:58.280
So they have a thing, actually. You report it to Xbox.com slash abuse, and there's a link to-

12:58.280 --> 13:03.280
Normally it's for offensive stuff, but there's also a thing for if it's broken.

13:03.280 --> 13:07.280
And so hopefully they'll fix it. It says I purchased it, and then I'll get to play it.

13:07.280 --> 13:11.280
Ssj100matt in our chatroom, chat.orangewordancemedia.com wants to clarify,

13:11.280 --> 13:14.280
when the fixed version comes out, you can re-download it and it will be okay.

13:14.280 --> 13:16.280
You don't need to buy it again.

13:16.280 --> 13:20.280
And it's Angry Berry, like B-A-R-R-Y, like Barack.

13:20.280 --> 13:23.280
Not Angry Berry as in, like, Raspberry or Dingleberry.

13:23.280 --> 13:25.280
Yes. Angry Berry.

13:25.280 --> 13:28.280
And it looks awesome.

13:28.280 --> 13:31.280
Interesting. Alright, anything else for your gaming week?

13:31.280 --> 13:32.280
No, that's it for right now.

13:32.280 --> 13:36.280
Alright, I want to talk about a few games that I played at E3 that I never got around to last week.

13:36.280 --> 13:40.280
And one of them is Blur, which is a pretty highly anticipated racing game, obviously,

13:40.280 --> 13:44.280
because it's coming from Bizarre Creations, who used to do the Project Gotham Racing.

13:44.280 --> 13:49.280
And, you know, as you know, they're doing their own series now. Blur has been announced what it is.

13:49.280 --> 13:55.280
And it's really not like Project Gotham Racing at all, which I could never really get into Project Gotham Racing

13:55.280 --> 13:59.280
because it was a little too much for me. Like, I can't control the car right.

13:59.280 --> 14:01.280
I'm too used to arcade racing games.

14:01.280 --> 14:03.280
Besides, I have Need for Speed Shift now, if you wanted that.

14:03.280 --> 14:10.280
Well, and the good news is, or, you know, the Forza series is continuing with Adam and all that.

14:10.280 --> 14:12.280
Anyhow...

14:12.280 --> 14:15.280
Well, Project Gotham, I don't know if that's still...

14:15.280 --> 14:18.280
I'm sorry. Yeah, Project Gotham, I don't know if that's continuing, but...

14:18.280 --> 14:19.280
I think it is.

14:19.280 --> 14:28.280
Yeah. Anyhow, Blur is now, like, a realistic racing game, but it mixes that with the types of stuff you'd see in Mario Kart,

14:28.280 --> 14:33.280
which I thought was actually kind of cool. Like, you know, the graphics obviously had a very electric feel to it.

14:33.280 --> 14:37.280
I'm not just talking about, that's why, because you see that in the trailer,

14:37.280 --> 14:42.280
but this very kind of, like, neon metal sort of look to it, like the blues and pinks and yellow,

14:42.280 --> 14:46.280
like, not, like, over the top, like, 80s, but kind of that metallic look to it.

14:46.280 --> 14:48.280
It's a very kind of neat, stylish-looking game.

14:48.280 --> 14:54.280
And as you race around the course, you can, you know, race over these power-ups, just like you do in Mario Kart,

14:54.280 --> 14:59.280
and they'll give you things such as a missile-type thing where you launch a red sphere at other cars in front of you,

14:59.280 --> 15:06.280
something called, like, Barrage, I think it was called, or something where it was, like, a purple thing that you'd shoot out on the sides, essentially,

15:06.280 --> 15:12.280
so you could push your way past somebody, and then, like, a bolt that would just send a random lightning bolt down,

15:12.280 --> 15:14.280
and, of course, a nitro that would speed you up.

15:14.280 --> 15:19.280
All these different types of power-ups in a Burnout-style arcade racer,

15:19.280 --> 15:24.280
not where, like, you know, pile-ups and crashing cars is encouraged like it is in Burnout,

15:24.280 --> 15:27.280
but that sort of, like, look and speed and feel to the cars to it.

15:27.280 --> 15:32.280
And the way they had it set up at E3 is that they had, like, 20 Xboxes all networked together,

15:32.280 --> 15:34.280
and everybody was essentially playing the same thing.

15:34.280 --> 15:37.280
And I had a lot of fun playing it. I think it'll be a fun game on Xbox Live.

15:37.280 --> 15:40.280
It's like Mario Kart, but more real cars.

15:40.280 --> 15:44.280
So, and from what I am understanding, they're actually licensing real cars for this game.

15:44.280 --> 15:45.280
Yeah.

15:45.280 --> 15:48.280
So it's, like, real cars that shoot lightning.

15:48.280 --> 15:52.280
So it's a little strange, but it was actually a heck of a lot of fun to play.

15:52.280 --> 15:54.280
I think I'm going to pick up the whole thing when it comes out.

15:54.280 --> 15:56.280
I don't know what you're thinking, Loki.

15:56.280 --> 15:57.280
I know you didn't play it, but...

15:57.280 --> 15:58.280
Oh, no, you did play it a little bit, didn't you?

15:58.280 --> 15:59.280
No.

15:59.280 --> 16:01.280
Oh, and, sorry, the Xbox broke when you sat down on the floor, didn't it?

16:01.280 --> 16:03.280
The server crashed when I tried to play it.

16:03.280 --> 16:04.280
That's right.

16:04.280 --> 16:07.280
I hope it looked fun.

16:07.280 --> 16:11.280
Some other games I played at E3 that I wanted to point out.

16:11.280 --> 16:14.280
White Knight Chronicles, I think we touched on a little bit last week.

16:14.280 --> 16:15.280
Yeah.

16:15.280 --> 16:16.280
I didn't play it, but I watched Loki play it.

16:16.280 --> 16:18.280
It looks like a lot of fun.

16:18.280 --> 16:19.280
That's a role-playing game.

16:19.280 --> 16:23.280
It looks pretty intensive, and I definitely want to check that out.

16:23.280 --> 16:25.280
That's a good exclusive for PlayStation 3.

16:25.280 --> 16:26.280
It is.

16:26.280 --> 16:28.280
Especially if you're, like, the role-playing fan type.

16:28.280 --> 16:33.280
Because it looks like it has the huge landscapes, kind of like Oblivion does, but it's more

16:33.280 --> 16:35.280
of a third-person-oriented game.

16:35.280 --> 16:37.280
It reminds me a lot of Final Fantasy XI.

16:37.280 --> 16:39.280
Like, the landscape's very similar to that.

16:39.280 --> 16:40.280
Really?

16:40.280 --> 16:41.280
There's zones.

16:41.280 --> 16:42.280
But not online.

16:42.280 --> 16:43.280
This game was not online.

16:43.280 --> 16:44.280
It's online, no.

16:44.280 --> 16:46.280
You actually, well, you can play online.

16:46.280 --> 16:50.280
You can play online with a party of a few people, and then you can do that.

16:50.280 --> 16:51.280
Or it's AI.

16:51.280 --> 16:52.280
And the AI actually is good.

16:52.280 --> 16:56.280
They do what they're supposed to, and they're not doing retarded things.

16:56.280 --> 16:59.280
So that's kind of cool.

16:59.280 --> 17:01.280
But I think it is online, too.

17:01.280 --> 17:02.280
So that might be fun.

17:02.280 --> 17:06.280
I don't think I ever mentioned last week that I did try out Katamari Forever, which is the

17:06.280 --> 17:10.280
new Katamari Damacy game on PlayStation 3 that takes some of the old levels and kind of repackages

17:10.280 --> 17:11.280
them.

17:11.280 --> 17:13.280
And there are some newer levels, too.

17:13.280 --> 17:17.280
Like, for instance, I played a level where you were rolling around the Katamari, and

17:17.280 --> 17:19.280
you would start in water.

17:19.280 --> 17:21.280
And then as you rolled around, you lost water.

17:21.280 --> 17:23.280
Kind of like, imagine your Katamari's a giant sponge.

17:23.280 --> 17:25.280
And you're basically rolling it over dirt.

17:25.280 --> 17:27.280
And as you roll over the dirt, flowers grow.

17:27.280 --> 17:32.280
So the idea was you tried to paint so much of the ground with flowers and the time limit.

17:32.280 --> 17:35.280
And then there's some secret, you know, the gal that was showing off the game was showing

17:35.280 --> 17:39.280
me there's some secret areas where you can find more water so you don't have to run back

17:39.280 --> 17:41.280
every time as you lose the water.

17:41.280 --> 17:44.280
And that's kind of the strategy to get higher scores in that level.

17:44.280 --> 17:46.280
So there are some new things in the game.

17:46.280 --> 17:49.280
So Katamari Forever is not just a rehashing of the old stages.

17:49.280 --> 17:53.280
The one thing that was cool about it is that they have different art styles.

17:53.280 --> 17:56.280
There's very unique different art styles now that you can use.

17:56.280 --> 18:00.280
Especially this whole, where it starts all in black and white.

18:00.280 --> 18:05.280
And then as you roll over objects, those objects will be in color anywhere you see them.

18:05.280 --> 18:06.280
Which I thought was kind of cool.

18:06.280 --> 18:11.280
So some of these new art styles they're adding are making the game feel newer and certainly

18:11.280 --> 18:15.280
it's not just like, oh, we're just going to repackage the same game on Playstation 3

18:15.280 --> 18:17.280
and, you know, with widescreen and we're done.

18:17.280 --> 18:19.280
You know, they definitely have gone back and done some tweaks.

18:19.280 --> 18:23.280
At the end of the day, though, it is still a lot of the same levels, you know, and things.

18:23.280 --> 18:27.280
So if you've owned every other Katamari game, well, heck, you're probably a big enough

18:27.280 --> 18:28.280
fan of the franchise.

18:28.280 --> 18:29.280
We're going to want to buy this anyway.

18:29.280 --> 18:35.280
But I definitely had, in the few minutes that I was playing this, I already had more fun

18:35.280 --> 18:37.280
playing it than I did beautiful Katamari on the 360.

18:37.280 --> 18:39.280
Which I just never got into.

18:39.280 --> 18:40.280
I don't know what it is.

18:40.280 --> 18:41.280
I don't know what it was about that game.

18:41.280 --> 18:43.280
Maybe it's just the controller of all things.

18:43.280 --> 18:46.280
I just could not get into Katamari on the 360.

18:46.280 --> 18:47.280
But the Playstation 3 one was fun.

18:47.280 --> 18:51.280
They added a new game mechanic, too, where you can actually bounce, you actually basically

18:51.280 --> 18:53.280
jump with the Katamari.

18:53.280 --> 18:58.280
Which is a little unrealistic, but hey, I mean, rolling around, rolling up entire islands

18:58.280 --> 18:59.280
in the earth is a little unrealistic, too.

18:59.280 --> 19:03.280
You know, I don't like, the only thing I would change about Katamari is I don't like

19:03.280 --> 19:10.280
the action that you have to do, the motion, to charge up your ball to do a little dash.

19:10.280 --> 19:14.280
I think it should just be a button press, which would make things a lot easier, because

19:14.280 --> 19:18.280
it's just a pain in the ass to kind of rock it back and forth to do that.

19:18.280 --> 19:22.280
Yeah, you know, I didn't actually try doing that, the dash.

19:22.280 --> 19:25.280
I was playing too much with the jump and the whole flipping.

19:25.280 --> 19:28.280
I like to do the, you know, you click the buttons and it flips the ball around so you

19:28.280 --> 19:31.280
don't have to spend the whole time doing a turn.

19:31.280 --> 19:38.280
In the chat, Azure Edge is saying, in Japan, Katamari Forever is called Katamari Tribute.

19:38.280 --> 19:39.280
Yeah, it's true.

19:39.280 --> 19:40.280
It was a different name in Japan.

19:40.280 --> 19:44.280
I believe it's already out over there.

19:44.280 --> 19:45.280
It was fun.

19:45.280 --> 19:46.280
I might pick it up.

19:46.280 --> 19:49.280
I was under the impression, I don't know why, I thought this game was an arcade game

19:49.280 --> 19:52.280
when I first saw it, like it was a Sony download game, but it's not.

19:52.280 --> 19:54.280
They told me it is coming out on disc.

19:54.280 --> 19:57.280
Yeah, that's what people thought, and it is coming out on disc.

19:57.280 --> 20:00.280
So it is a full disc game, just in case you weren't aware.

20:00.280 --> 20:06.280
One other game I think I wanted to mention, I'm looking at my notes.

20:06.280 --> 20:08.280
Oh, Toy Story Midway Mania.

20:08.280 --> 20:12.280
I never mentioned this game, which is, you know, Don't Write It Off is simply a child's

20:12.280 --> 20:13.280
little shoot-em game.

20:13.280 --> 20:17.280
This is one for Disney fans, which, you know, I know some of our listeners are.

20:17.280 --> 20:21.280
It is just like the ride that they have at Disneyland and Walt Disney World.

20:21.280 --> 20:23.280
They opened them both up this year.

20:23.280 --> 20:25.280
It's pretty much the same ride where you sit in the cars and go around.

20:25.280 --> 20:27.280
However, they have added new stages.

20:27.280 --> 20:30.280
There's like a skee-ball type stage, and you know, some other little games.

20:30.280 --> 20:34.280
And apparently it's the whole thing where as you play more and get more points,

20:34.280 --> 20:35.280
you can unlock more mini-games.

20:35.280 --> 20:37.280
But here's the funniest thing about it.

20:37.280 --> 20:40.280
It is going to come with 3D glasses, and you can play the games in 3D,

20:40.280 --> 20:41.280
just like you do on the ride.

20:41.280 --> 20:43.280
So I think that's kind of funny.

20:43.280 --> 20:44.280
Pretty cool.

20:44.280 --> 20:48.280
Yeah, so I think this game is, you know, if you're a Disney fan,

20:48.280 --> 20:51.280
for most people, especially you're really hardcore gamers,

20:51.280 --> 20:52.280
you're going to look at this and go,

20:52.280 --> 20:56.280
this is just another crappy Wii game with a bunch of, you know, little mini-games.

20:56.280 --> 20:59.280
But I think especially like if you have kids, or you're just like a Disney fan,

20:59.280 --> 21:03.280
and you have, like for me, it's the nostalgia of the ride

21:03.280 --> 21:05.280
and being at Disneyland that really does it for me.

21:05.280 --> 21:06.280
So it's cool.

21:06.280 --> 21:07.280
It's a cool little mini-game collection.

21:07.280 --> 21:09.280
The other one that I thought was kind of cool is a mini-game,

21:09.280 --> 21:13.280
and it's kind of like Jenga, where you, like these little block structures

21:13.280 --> 21:16.280
will appear, and like you load this cannon with a ball,

21:16.280 --> 21:18.280
and then you kind of swing the Wiimote to throw the ball.

21:18.280 --> 21:21.280
And then depending on like when and where you throw it,

21:21.280 --> 21:24.280
you knock, you're trying to knock over as many blocks as possible.

21:24.280 --> 21:25.280
Boom blocks, awesome.

21:25.280 --> 21:28.280
Is it kind of like, yeah, it's kind of a rip off of that, I guess.

21:28.280 --> 21:29.280
But I thought that was kind of fun.

21:29.280 --> 21:31.280
So take it or leave it.

21:31.280 --> 21:32.280
There you go.

21:32.280 --> 21:35.280
All right, just so you know tonight on the show,

21:35.280 --> 21:37.280
getting into some housekeeping a little bit,

21:37.280 --> 21:39.280
we're going to try something new tonight with the show,

21:39.280 --> 21:41.280
kind of just based on feedback and things we've been wanting to do for a while,

21:41.280 --> 21:43.280
which is a little weird because Jamie's not here,

21:43.280 --> 21:45.280
but she knows about it, and she'll get here probably halfway through the show

21:45.280 --> 21:46.280
and be able to help out.

21:46.280 --> 21:49.280
We're going to try something tonight, and it may or may not work.

21:49.280 --> 21:52.280
First off, we're going to have the Skypline open all night long,

21:52.280 --> 21:54.280
which I know we've done before to make success,

21:54.280 --> 21:58.280
but one reason we think people don't usually call in

21:58.280 --> 22:00.280
when we have the Skypline open all night long

22:00.280 --> 22:02.280
is that we move too quick from story to story.

22:02.280 --> 22:08.280
So since most of you guys that listen to the show already know the news

22:08.280 --> 22:10.280
and kind of the main rundown of stuff that happened in the week,

22:10.280 --> 22:13.280
I'm sure you read gaming blogs, you listen to other shows,

22:13.280 --> 22:16.280
we want to expand a little more on having roundtable discussions

22:16.280 --> 22:18.280
on a limited scope of stories.

22:18.280 --> 22:21.280
Don't worry, we'll bring you the quick news too close to the end of the show,

22:21.280 --> 22:24.280
but we're going to try focusing on in our Part A and Part B,

22:24.280 --> 22:27.280
just like maybe six stories each segment,

22:27.280 --> 22:30.280
that can kind of get a little more discussion.

22:30.280 --> 22:33.280
So if you want to call in at any point during the show to add to the discussion,

22:33.280 --> 22:36.280
you can always give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR,

22:36.280 --> 22:39.280
or of course you can always send us emails and so forth.

22:39.280 --> 22:42.280
Of course our chat room, chat.orangelandraday.com,

22:42.280 --> 22:43.280
is always available there as well.

22:43.280 --> 22:46.280
And then of course we're going to spend a little more time in studio

22:46.280 --> 22:47.280
talking about these different topics.

22:47.280 --> 22:49.280
So let us know your feedback.

22:49.280 --> 22:51.280
Of course, as always, mailbag at orangelandraday.com,

22:51.280 --> 22:54.280
or our Twitter, twitter.com slash o-l-r,

22:54.280 --> 22:58.280
or the Facebook group, the OL Army,

22:58.280 --> 23:00.280
which we haven't really done anything with for a while.

23:00.280 --> 23:01.280
We need to.

23:01.280 --> 23:03.280
And yeah, so we're just going to open it up.

23:03.280 --> 23:07.280
Less stories, more time on each story is basically what it boils down to.

23:07.280 --> 23:10.280
So let's see what happens.

23:10.280 --> 23:13.280
So I'll start off tonight with a news story

23:13.280 --> 23:17.280
that kind of confirms something we heard about a while ago.

23:17.280 --> 23:19.280
There was a trademark about this a little while ago

23:19.280 --> 23:23.280
that spurred this whole debate I think we've had once before on the show.

23:23.280 --> 23:25.280
But it was confirmed.

23:25.280 --> 23:29.280
Nintendo will be launching a help feature inside of their games.

23:29.280 --> 23:32.280
This story comes from USA Today's Game Hunter blog.

23:32.280 --> 23:34.280
Game Hunter's blog, sorry.

23:34.280 --> 23:37.280
And it's talking about how Miyamoto has essentially confirmed

23:37.280 --> 23:40.280
that on New Super Mario Brothers Wii,

23:40.280 --> 23:43.280
you're going to be able to pause the game if you're on a difficult level,

23:43.280 --> 23:45.280
and the game can take over to complete the level,

23:45.280 --> 23:49.280
and then you hit a button whenever you want to resume playing.

23:49.280 --> 23:52.280
And the thought behind it is that if you have a younger player

23:52.280 --> 23:54.280
or you have somebody who is newer to video games,

23:54.280 --> 23:56.280
they don't get so intimidated by it.

23:56.280 --> 24:01.280
Which, if you remember right, was Nintendo's whole thing in the first place.

24:01.280 --> 24:04.280
The whole reason why they introduced the Wii in the first place was that,

24:04.280 --> 24:06.280
hey, everybody knows how to use a remote control.

24:06.280 --> 24:08.280
People get intimidated by game controllers.

24:08.280 --> 24:11.280
Let's take that intimidation factor out.

24:11.280 --> 24:14.280
But now they're talking about, oh, now they're going to take,

24:14.280 --> 24:18.280
essentially, the challenge out of the game for those that want it.

24:18.280 --> 24:22.280
And of course, as you can imagine, this is hugely controversial.

24:22.280 --> 24:26.280
Moving on with the story, Shigeru Miyamoto did say in the interview

24:26.280 --> 24:29.280
that there's going to be this demo play,

24:29.280 --> 24:32.280
is what they're calling it, the tentative name of this, the demo play.

24:32.280 --> 24:34.280
Here's the quote from the article.

24:34.280 --> 24:36.280
Quote, in New Super Mario Brothers Wii,

24:36.280 --> 24:39.280
if a player is experiencing an area of difficulty,

24:39.280 --> 24:42.280
this will allow them to clear troubled areas and take over when they're ready.

24:42.280 --> 24:46.280
And yes, we're looking into this for future games, too.

24:46.280 --> 24:48.280
So it's the easy button.

24:48.280 --> 24:50.280
Like in the Staples commercials, you hit the button,

24:50.280 --> 24:52.280
and easy, you get your way through it.

24:52.280 --> 24:54.280
Good thing, bad thing, Loki.

24:54.280 --> 24:59.280
As I mentioned earlier, I know it's wrong to say this,

24:59.280 --> 25:01.280
but this is completely gay.

25:01.280 --> 25:03.280
And the reason why...

25:03.280 --> 25:05.280
It does make me want to sleep with games of the same gender.

25:05.280 --> 25:06.280
Exactly.

25:06.280 --> 25:07.280
It does.

25:07.280 --> 25:13.280
No, it's okay to have... I guess it's alright if they want to put this option in

25:13.280 --> 25:16.280
to other games, like Zelda or something like that.

25:16.280 --> 25:20.280
That makes sense, because you're playing it demo-wise,

25:20.280 --> 25:22.280
you can learn more of the story and stuff.

25:22.280 --> 25:24.280
New Super Mario Brothers for the Wii,

25:24.280 --> 25:26.280
I can't imagine that has a story at all.

25:26.280 --> 25:30.280
So really, you're basically taking away the only element of the game,

25:30.280 --> 25:32.280
which is playing it.

25:32.280 --> 25:35.280
And so, I don't know.

25:35.280 --> 25:38.280
I can't imagine these games being that difficult,

25:38.280 --> 25:42.280
and the fact is that you can actually just autopilot the whole thing

25:42.280 --> 25:44.280
seems kind of retarded to me.

25:44.280 --> 25:47.280
And also, in the same way people are defending it and saying,

25:47.280 --> 25:51.280
well, this will allow you to be able to make the games more hardcore,

25:51.280 --> 25:53.280
more difficult for those that want it,

25:53.280 --> 25:56.280
and those that can't handle it, well, they can push the easy button.

25:56.280 --> 26:00.280
But at the same time, why can't they just balance it,

26:00.280 --> 26:02.280
put the effort into balancing the game,

26:02.280 --> 26:05.280
so that you have it for the easy players,

26:05.280 --> 26:07.280
and for the more experienced players?

26:07.280 --> 26:09.280
Oh, I know, like effort.

26:09.280 --> 26:12.280
No, let's just autopilot the whole thing.

26:12.280 --> 26:13.280
That's even better.

26:13.280 --> 26:14.280
Okay, but what about the argument,

26:14.280 --> 26:16.280
and this is the first thing I think of too,

26:16.280 --> 26:18.280
and I see AlphaCananagram going to it in chat,

26:18.280 --> 26:19.280
don't use it.

26:19.280 --> 26:21.280
You don't like it, don't use it.

26:21.280 --> 26:24.280
I don't care, it's just insulting that it's there in the first place.

26:24.280 --> 26:28.280
I mean, because really, the message that comes across with that

26:28.280 --> 26:30.280
is not that, oh, we're trying to help players.

26:30.280 --> 26:33.280
Maybe like Devil May Cry or something like that,

26:33.280 --> 26:38.280
or a game that's been notably insanely hard all the time.

26:38.280 --> 26:41.280
Maybe something like an easy mode for that or something,

26:41.280 --> 26:44.280
but not necessarily something that just plays the game for yourself.

26:44.280 --> 26:51.280
I don't know, I think the better option should be something more approachable

26:51.280 --> 26:55.280
as far as an easier gameplay option or something like that,

26:55.280 --> 26:57.280
an easier difficulty so that those people...

26:57.280 --> 27:00.280
you can take those portions of the game that are going to be frustrating out of it

27:00.280 --> 27:03.280
or make them easier on this new difficulty.

27:03.280 --> 27:06.280
I'm supposed to give you a slap on the wrist for calling it gay, by the way,

27:06.280 --> 27:07.280
from the chatters.

27:07.280 --> 27:09.280
Whatever, you know.

27:09.280 --> 27:12.280
Obviously, he doesn't mean harm by that,

27:12.280 --> 27:13.280
or I would, you know, I'm gay.

27:13.280 --> 27:16.280
I'd kick his ass if I thought he actually meant malice by that,

27:16.280 --> 27:20.280
but it is one of those things where I think the reason why you say that

27:20.280 --> 27:23.280
and even why I allow you to say that

27:23.280 --> 27:29.280
is because Nintendo does have that whole happy, sunshiny, rainbow, clouds.

27:29.280 --> 27:32.280
If you think back to the old meaning of gay,

27:32.280 --> 27:33.280
it does have that very...

27:33.280 --> 27:34.280
You know what I mean?

27:34.280 --> 27:37.280
It has that feel to it that Nintendo is all sugary sweet to it.

27:37.280 --> 27:40.280
It's not even really entirely Nintendo's fault.

27:40.280 --> 27:42.280
I put blame on society for this, too,

27:42.280 --> 27:46.280
because nowadays it's not about, you know...

27:46.280 --> 27:49.280
It's about everybody participating and everybody's a winner

27:49.280 --> 27:51.280
because they've participated.

27:51.280 --> 27:53.280
That's great, except you're not participating.

27:53.280 --> 27:56.280
You're just pushing a button and the game's doing it all for yourself.

27:56.280 --> 27:58.280
So now that you've seen the end of the game,

27:58.280 --> 28:00.280
what's really going to entice you to go through it?

28:00.280 --> 28:02.280
I mean, on your own.

28:02.280 --> 28:03.280
It's not.

28:03.280 --> 28:06.280
And it really just sends home the message that

28:06.280 --> 28:09.280
Nintendo doesn't really give a crap about the core game.

28:09.280 --> 28:11.280
I mean, they do in a certain sense,

28:11.280 --> 28:15.280
but at the same time, really, their console is for the younger audience

28:15.280 --> 28:17.280
and, well, we're making a few games for you as well.

28:17.280 --> 28:19.280
Let me read some comments from chat.

28:19.280 --> 28:21.280
And if you have a thought on this, too, give us a call.

28:21.280 --> 28:23.280
1-877-GAME-OLR.

28:23.280 --> 28:25.280
Is this making games too easy? What's going on?

28:25.280 --> 28:27.280
Some other comments from chat here.

28:27.280 --> 28:28.280
And this is one I agree with.

28:28.280 --> 28:29.280
There's a gold anthro in chat that says,

28:29.280 --> 28:31.280
you will have the temptation to use it.

28:31.280 --> 28:32.280
That's the problem.

28:32.280 --> 28:35.280
And for me, that might make me a little nervous, too.

28:35.280 --> 28:36.280
But let's go to the phones.

28:36.280 --> 28:37.280
We have a call.

28:37.280 --> 28:40.280
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this?

28:40.280 --> 28:45.280
Hello, you're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this?

28:45.280 --> 28:48.280
And wouldn't you know, like, the first call we take,

28:48.280 --> 28:50.280
it doesn't work.

28:50.280 --> 28:52.280
Didn't use the easy button.

28:52.280 --> 28:53.280
That's right.

28:53.280 --> 28:54.280
Your call needs to be automated.

28:54.280 --> 28:56.280
Can I please pause the show and hit the button?

28:56.280 --> 28:57.280
No, all right.

28:57.280 --> 28:58.280
Here's the thing.

28:58.280 --> 29:04.280
I'm also surprised that this was not launched in the Zelda type of game.

29:04.280 --> 29:06.280
And I kind of get it for that.

29:06.280 --> 29:09.280
But I kind of agree with what GameGuru is saying in chat.

29:09.280 --> 29:10.280
It's a Super Mario Brothers game.

29:10.280 --> 29:13.280
If you can't play, you may as well give up gaming.

29:13.280 --> 29:14.280
I don't know. Let's see.

29:14.280 --> 29:16.280
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this?

29:16.280 --> 29:18.280
Hi, this is Gold Anthro, actually.

29:18.280 --> 29:19.280
Oh, Gold Anthro.

29:19.280 --> 29:20.280
I just read one of your comments a minute ago.

29:20.280 --> 29:21.280
What are your thoughts on this?

29:21.280 --> 29:24.280
Is this making games too easy?

29:24.280 --> 29:25.280
I think it is.

29:25.280 --> 29:27.280
Because, you know, people say,

29:27.280 --> 29:29.280
don't use it if you don't want to.

29:29.280 --> 29:32.280
Like, if you don't want to use it, don't use it.

29:32.280 --> 29:35.280
But there's that temptation.

29:35.280 --> 29:37.280
Ah, sorry.

29:37.280 --> 29:42.280
There's a temptation that people will use it because it is there.

29:42.280 --> 29:47.280
I mean, if there's no reward for not using it, I'm sorry.

29:47.280 --> 29:49.280
I got my family yelling at me.

29:49.280 --> 29:50.280
You know what I mean.

29:50.280 --> 29:51.280
There's going to be that temptation.

29:51.280 --> 29:52.280
No, that's okay.

29:52.280 --> 29:55.280
That's kind of where I feel, too, is that it gives that temptation.

29:55.280 --> 29:57.280
But I'm trying to look at both sides of this.

29:57.280 --> 29:58.280
I really am.

29:58.280 --> 30:02.280
The Wii is that family-friendly, even your...

30:02.280 --> 30:04.280
I'm going to let you go, Gold Anthro, but thanks for the feedback.

30:04.280 --> 30:11.280
Wii's got that very family-friendly soccer mom,

30:11.280 --> 30:14.280
let the seven-year-old play Image to Preserve.

30:14.280 --> 30:18.280
You know, a feature like this kind of makes sense for a system like that.

30:18.280 --> 30:20.280
I don't think it does.

30:20.280 --> 30:27.280
The problem with Nintendo and a lot of the game publishers

30:27.280 --> 30:32.280
and a lot of the companies out there that are producing consoles is this.

30:32.280 --> 30:36.280
They're making the consoles and the games more approachable

30:36.280 --> 30:38.280
to people that don't play games,

30:38.280 --> 30:41.280
but people are still not biting on them,

30:41.280 --> 30:43.280
and so they're like, why are they not?

30:43.280 --> 30:44.280
Let me take another call.

30:44.280 --> 30:45.280
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

30:45.280 --> 30:46.280
Who's this?

30:46.280 --> 30:47.280
Hi, it's Sterlok.

30:47.280 --> 30:48.280
Hi, Sterlok.

30:48.280 --> 30:50.280
What do you think about this whole Nintendo easy mode

30:50.280 --> 30:52.280
or what they're calling it demo mode?

30:52.280 --> 30:54.280
Is this a good idea, bad idea?

30:54.280 --> 30:57.280
I think it's a great idea.

30:57.280 --> 31:03.280
I'm blind, and this would be awesome for something like Zelda

31:03.280 --> 31:08.280
because I just like to walk around and just dick around.

31:08.280 --> 31:17.280
If I want to get further, it's really easy to just turn this thing on.

31:17.280 --> 31:18.280
I think it's a great idea.

31:18.280 --> 31:21.280
You're saying that you're blind

31:21.280 --> 31:25.280
and that you have probably problems with certain other games.

31:25.280 --> 31:29.280
Do you find Zelda to be too hard the way it is now?

31:29.280 --> 31:33.280
You probably kind of learn to deal with that

31:33.280 --> 31:35.280
as you're playing with the video games, right?

31:35.280 --> 31:39.280
Yeah, since I'm totally blind, I just play with sound.

31:39.280 --> 31:42.280
Are you the same one that sent us e-mails before

31:42.280 --> 31:44.280
on some of these subjects about some of the music games?

31:44.280 --> 31:46.280
Okay, yeah, I remember you.

31:46.280 --> 31:49.280
I guess here's kind of my thought.

31:49.280 --> 31:52.280
That's a very good thing I wouldn't have thought of before

31:52.280 --> 31:54.280
is that maybe it makes some of these games more handicap accessible,

31:54.280 --> 31:57.280
certainly, if there's something a little too difficult.

31:57.280 --> 32:02.280
But you've kind of come all this time gaming with that.

32:02.280 --> 32:06.280
So why now for this?

32:06.280 --> 32:10.280
Well, the main thing for me is progressing in the game itself.

32:10.280 --> 32:13.280
That's the big thing for me, why I think this is such a good idea.

32:13.280 --> 32:19.280
If I want to get further in these games, other than just walking around

32:19.280 --> 32:21.280
and just doing a bunch of nothing,

32:21.280 --> 32:25.280
I would have to get someone else to basically do it for me.

32:25.280 --> 32:32.280
Sturlock, have you had games, a lot of games, where you hit that brick wall?

32:32.280 --> 32:36.280
Yeah, because I'm big into RPGs.

32:36.280 --> 32:41.280
Basically, I'm sort of restricted to just walking around

32:41.280 --> 32:44.280
and finding random battles, which I like.

32:44.280 --> 32:53.280
But if I want to progress in the story, not a whole lot I can do about that.

32:53.280 --> 32:56.280
Well, Sturlock, I really appreciate the insight

32:56.280 --> 32:59.280
and giving us another angle we may not have thought of otherwise.

32:59.280 --> 33:01.280
So thank you very much, Sturlock, and you have a good one.

33:01.280 --> 33:03.280
You too.

33:03.280 --> 33:05.280
Definitely something I wouldn't have thought of before.

33:05.280 --> 33:09.280
What about folks who might have something where they can't?

33:09.280 --> 33:12.280
But maybe this speaks to a greater thing about making games

33:12.280 --> 33:14.280
more handicap accessible to begin with,

33:14.280 --> 33:17.280
and maybe this just isn't the way to do it. I don't know.

33:17.280 --> 33:19.280
Then if that's the case, then how noble of Nintendo.

33:19.280 --> 33:21.280
However, I don't think that's why they're doing it.

33:21.280 --> 33:24.280
I would agree.

33:24.280 --> 33:27.280
It's a perk for folks, but it's not the reason.

33:27.280 --> 33:29.280
It's okay. We've made the games easier.

33:29.280 --> 33:32.280
We've made the system that's more approachable for gamers

33:32.280 --> 33:35.280
or people who have never played a game in their life before.

33:35.280 --> 33:38.280
But the problem is still there's people out there

33:38.280 --> 33:40.280
that they have not been able to capture yet

33:40.280 --> 33:42.280
that aren't interested in the games, and they're trying to figure out,

33:42.280 --> 33:43.280
why is that?

33:43.280 --> 33:45.280
Oh, it must be that they're still too hard.

33:45.280 --> 33:47.280
They're still too difficult.

33:47.280 --> 33:51.280
Let's put this feature in that allows the game to play itself

33:51.280 --> 33:53.280
in case they get stuck.

33:53.280 --> 33:55.280
That's great, but you know what?

33:55.280 --> 34:01.280
Getting that feature out there to a consumer that's not playing games,

34:01.280 --> 34:03.280
I'm pretty sure they're probably not up to date

34:03.280 --> 34:06.280
on everything that's coming into a certain game.

34:06.280 --> 34:09.280
They're probably not going to know about it anyways.

34:09.280 --> 34:12.280
And it's really just a waste of time,

34:12.280 --> 34:14.280
because I don't think it's really going to accomplish

34:14.280 --> 34:16.280
what they're hoping that it will accomplish.

34:16.280 --> 34:17.280
Let me read a few more things from chat,

34:17.280 --> 34:19.280
and then we'll move on with some more stories tonight.

34:19.280 --> 34:21.280
I wanted to read some of these comments.

34:21.280 --> 34:23.280
Azure Edge in chat says,

34:23.280 --> 34:25.280
I thought all of this was just when you pause,

34:25.280 --> 34:27.280
a movie comes up showing you how to do it,

34:27.280 --> 34:29.280
but when you resume the game, you start off where you were at.

34:29.280 --> 34:31.280
And perhaps that was in the original trademark.

34:31.280 --> 34:33.280
I would have no problems with that.

34:33.280 --> 34:34.280
That's fine.

34:34.280 --> 34:36.280
If they're giving you tips on how to play the game,

34:36.280 --> 34:38.280
then yeah, that seems very fair,

34:38.280 --> 34:40.280
because that way they're helping you along,

34:40.280 --> 34:42.280
but you actually have to do it.

34:42.280 --> 34:43.280
And I do encourage that.

34:43.280 --> 34:46.280
Let me read that quote again from Miyamoto.

34:46.280 --> 34:47.280
In New Super Mario Brothers Wii,

34:47.280 --> 34:49.280
if a player is experiencing an area of difficulty,

34:49.280 --> 34:51.280
this will allow them to clear troubled areas

34:51.280 --> 34:53.280
and take over when they're ready.

34:53.280 --> 34:54.280
So, very interesting.

34:54.280 --> 34:55.280
So yeah, that does not sound...

34:55.280 --> 34:56.280
Let's take one more call, because we've got another call.

34:56.280 --> 34:59.280
Hi, you're on Ornson's Radio. Who's this?

34:59.280 --> 35:00.280
This is Spazinator.

35:00.280 --> 35:03.280
Hey Spazinator, quickly, is this a good idea or a bad idea,

35:03.280 --> 35:05.280
the demo mode?

35:05.280 --> 35:08.280
A bad idea.

35:08.280 --> 35:11.280
For a couple reasons.

35:11.280 --> 35:18.280
First, although Nintendo is not coming out and directly saying it,

35:18.280 --> 35:23.280
they're kind of implying that gamers are stupid.

35:23.280 --> 35:30.280
They have to handle gamers to get them to finish the game.

35:30.280 --> 35:33.280
And you've got to remember,

35:33.280 --> 35:36.280
at least back in the original NES game,

35:36.280 --> 35:43.280
they were scared towards the kids.

35:43.280 --> 35:46.280
They were playing really, really difficult games on there,

35:46.280 --> 35:49.280
like Kid Icarus, for one.

35:49.280 --> 35:53.280
Games like that were really difficult.

35:53.280 --> 35:59.280
People loved those games, even though they were difficult.

35:59.280 --> 36:04.280
And a lot of people take pride in the fact

36:04.280 --> 36:07.280
that they played these really difficult games

36:07.280 --> 36:11.280
and ended up beating them.

36:11.280 --> 36:15.280
For me, I feel that if a game is too easy,

36:15.280 --> 36:18.280
you tend to lose interest in it.

36:18.280 --> 36:20.280
Thank you very much, Spazinator, for the input.

36:20.280 --> 36:21.280
We're going to talk about this a little bit,

36:21.280 --> 36:23.280
but I'm going to go ahead and let you go for now

36:23.280 --> 36:25.280
when we move on to other topics.

36:25.280 --> 36:28.280
Some of what Spazinator is saying,

36:28.280 --> 36:31.280
he kind of compares to the older games,

36:31.280 --> 36:33.280
and a lot of people are very fond of those games.

36:33.280 --> 36:35.280
When I think about this easy mode,

36:35.280 --> 36:37.280
yeah, it's making games more accessible

36:37.280 --> 36:39.280
to 7-year-olds and 10-year-olds,

36:39.280 --> 36:40.280
but then I think back,

36:40.280 --> 36:41.280
okay, when I was 10 years old,

36:41.280 --> 36:42.280
I was busting my way through Kid Icarus,

36:42.280 --> 36:44.280
which was one of the hardest games ever.

36:44.280 --> 36:45.280
But at the same time,

36:45.280 --> 36:47.280
I don't think the classic Nintendo

36:47.280 --> 36:49.280
has penetrated the marketplace

36:49.280 --> 36:50.280
the same way the Wii has.

36:50.280 --> 36:53.280
I mean, the Wii is just huge. Huge.

36:53.280 --> 36:57.280
There's a lot of problems,

36:57.280 --> 37:00.280
and it's a lot of just stuff that right now,

37:00.280 --> 37:01.280
it's society.

37:01.280 --> 37:04.280
Basically, the games out here now,

37:04.280 --> 37:05.280
if you're going to put out a lot of games

37:05.280 --> 37:06.280
that you're trying to make accessible

37:06.280 --> 37:07.280
for a 7-year-old,

37:07.280 --> 37:10.280
and they're really super-duper easy,

37:10.280 --> 37:13.280
yeah, you may get them interested in playing games

37:13.280 --> 37:15.280
and they may think that they're all awesome

37:15.280 --> 37:17.280
because they're able to finish these games,

37:17.280 --> 37:18.280
but at the same time,

37:18.280 --> 37:20.280
is that really making the 7-year-old a better gamer?

37:20.280 --> 37:21.280
I mean, later on down the line,

37:21.280 --> 37:23.280
are they going to be any better?

37:23.280 --> 37:25.280
I think if you have to play a harder game

37:25.280 --> 37:27.280
and you actually stick with it,

37:27.280 --> 37:30.280
which is something we should be teaching our kids anyways,

37:30.280 --> 37:31.280
sticking with something instead of,

37:31.280 --> 37:33.280
oh, I can't do it, I quit.

37:33.280 --> 37:37.280
I mean, that's really, I think, more important than anything

37:37.280 --> 37:38.280
because then that way,

37:38.280 --> 37:40.280
they learn to play the harder game,

37:40.280 --> 37:43.280
they feel the accomplishment of finishing said hard game,

37:43.280 --> 37:46.280
and then that makes them a better gamer overall.

37:46.280 --> 37:47.280
All right, one more chat comment,

37:47.280 --> 37:48.280
then we'll move on to the next story.

37:48.280 --> 37:50.280
Deep Man in chat says,

37:50.280 --> 37:52.280
also, I would probably use it when playing Zelda.

37:52.280 --> 37:54.280
I love the series and the plot of the games,

37:54.280 --> 37:56.280
but it just can't seem to focus.

37:56.280 --> 37:58.280
But if I can progress quickly

37:58.280 --> 38:00.280
without breaking the flow of the story,

38:00.280 --> 38:01.280
then please hook me up.

38:01.280 --> 38:04.280
This could be an interesting perspective,

38:04.280 --> 38:06.280
and this is, you know, again,

38:06.280 --> 38:10.280
where I almost support this feature in games like Zelda.

38:10.280 --> 38:12.280
I'm not sure how I feel about it in, like, a Mario game,

38:12.280 --> 38:14.280
but an adventure game like Zelda,

38:14.280 --> 38:16.280
jury's still out for me on this whole thing.

38:16.280 --> 38:17.280
I can be swayed either way.

38:17.280 --> 38:18.280
I need to see it in action.

38:18.280 --> 38:20.280
But for the Zelda games, I kind of sympathize.

38:20.280 --> 38:23.280
I am such a short attention span gamer sometimes

38:23.280 --> 38:26.280
that sometimes I don't want the challenge.

38:26.280 --> 38:27.280
I want that story.

38:27.280 --> 38:29.280
I want to watch the whole thing unfold.

38:29.280 --> 38:31.280
Do you know how many games sit on my shelf

38:31.280 --> 38:32.280
that I haven't beat

38:32.280 --> 38:35.280
because I quickly move from one game to the next?

38:35.280 --> 38:36.280
Like, I don't know.

38:36.280 --> 38:38.280
I wish there almost sometimes there was a way.

38:38.280 --> 38:40.280
I could just go back and finish them all.

38:40.280 --> 38:41.280
But I don't know.

38:41.280 --> 38:43.280
And that's great, but I don't think New Super Mario Bros.

38:43.280 --> 38:44.280
has a story.

38:44.280 --> 38:46.280
I'm pretty sure it doesn't.

38:46.280 --> 38:47.280
So there's really no point.

38:47.280 --> 38:49.280
And on top of that,

38:49.280 --> 38:52.280
stop trying to develop technology to demo actual games

38:52.280 --> 38:55.280
and give us stupid demos, for God's sake.

38:55.280 --> 38:58.280
Seriously, it'd be nice to have demos for, I don't know,

38:58.280 --> 39:01.280
Virtual Console, WiiWare, actual games.

39:01.280 --> 39:03.280
That might be nice so I can know

39:03.280 --> 39:05.280
if something's a stinker or not before I buy it.

39:05.280 --> 39:06.280
Oh, that's right.

39:06.280 --> 39:07.280
You wouldn't want that

39:07.280 --> 39:09.280
because then there goes all your sales

39:09.280 --> 39:11.280
when people realize that these games suck.

39:11.280 --> 39:13.280
But just one more thing I wanted to throw out there

39:13.280 --> 39:15.280
is that, again, in the whole adventure games,

39:15.280 --> 39:17.280
when I get stuck, I go to gamefacts.com.

39:17.280 --> 39:20.280
How much different is this

39:20.280 --> 39:22.280
than having to look up the FAQ to get...

39:22.280 --> 39:24.280
Like, for instance, playing Final Fantasy IV,

39:24.280 --> 39:27.280
the after years, which was a game I continued on with this week.

39:27.280 --> 39:29.280
You know, I got into this...

39:29.280 --> 39:31.280
I was going through this one cave, the Devil's Road,

39:31.280 --> 39:34.280
which is like, you know, you go from warp point to warp point,

39:34.280 --> 39:37.280
and then you get in this one room that's like a giant maze,

39:37.280 --> 39:40.280
and I was just like, God, I don't want to do another maze.

39:40.280 --> 39:41.280
I want to get to a save point.

39:41.280 --> 39:42.280
I want to go eat a burger

39:42.280 --> 39:44.280
because that's just where I was at that point.

39:44.280 --> 39:45.280
So you know what?

39:45.280 --> 39:46.280
I loaded up Final Fantasy Wikia,

39:46.280 --> 39:49.280
and there was a whole little map on how to get through that room,

39:49.280 --> 39:51.280
and I just did it, and I was like, yay.

39:51.280 --> 39:52.280
Exactly. That's fine.

39:52.280 --> 39:55.280
That's okay, but see, you're not relying on...

39:55.280 --> 39:57.280
I mean, to get you through a certain point,

39:57.280 --> 39:59.280
it's just helping you out.

39:59.280 --> 40:02.280
It's not saying, okay, you know, you need to do this,

40:02.280 --> 40:04.280
or, you know, here, let me do this for you.

40:04.280 --> 40:07.280
It's just saying, you know, here's what you need to do.

40:07.280 --> 40:08.280
Go do it.

40:08.280 --> 40:09.280
All right.

40:09.280 --> 40:10.280
And that's fine.

40:10.280 --> 40:12.280
That's just like saying, you know, hey, Rob,

40:12.280 --> 40:13.280
I'm stuck in the Zelda game.

40:13.280 --> 40:15.280
You've gotten past this point.

40:15.280 --> 40:16.280
What am I supposed to do?

40:16.280 --> 40:19.280
It's just like that, and there's no harm in that

40:19.280 --> 40:21.280
because you're still having to do it.

40:21.280 --> 40:22.280
It's just giving you a tip.

40:22.280 --> 40:23.280
How often did you...

40:23.280 --> 40:25.280
I know like many years ago, like in high school and stuff,

40:25.280 --> 40:26.280
how often did you do that?

40:26.280 --> 40:27.280
Like, your friend would be playing the game.

40:27.280 --> 40:28.280
I can't get past this part.

40:28.280 --> 40:29.280
Give me the controller.

40:29.280 --> 40:30.280
Okay, there you go.

40:30.280 --> 40:31.280
Exactly.

40:31.280 --> 40:33.280
Why isn't Nintendo just bringing back the Nintendo tip line?

40:33.280 --> 40:35.280
I mean, they can make more money that way.

40:35.280 --> 40:36.280
Get some game counselors on staff.

40:36.280 --> 40:37.280
There you go.

40:37.280 --> 40:38.280
All right, let's move on with some more news.

40:38.280 --> 40:39.280
All right.

40:39.280 --> 40:43.280
Well, some other interesting stuff,

40:43.280 --> 40:46.280
more in the music gaming platforms,

40:46.280 --> 40:50.280
but we've got Neversoft talking about possibilities

40:50.280 --> 40:54.280
of adding the DJ Hero turntable support

40:54.280 --> 40:56.280
for future Guitar Hero games.

40:56.280 --> 40:58.280
Now, that makes kind of sense if you think about it

40:58.280 --> 41:02.280
because Guitar Hero 5, really, they're pushing that,

41:02.280 --> 41:04.280
hey, you can play in any band setup whatsoever,

41:04.280 --> 41:09.280
if it be four drummers, three guitars a singer, whatever.

41:09.280 --> 41:15.280
So maybe later on, they can add DJ support as well.

41:15.280 --> 41:17.280
They said they would have liked to have worked it into

41:17.280 --> 41:18.280
Guitar Hero 5.

41:18.280 --> 41:21.280
Unfortunately, Guitar Hero 5 ships in a few months,

41:21.280 --> 41:26.280
and it's a few months before the DJ Hero thing comes out,

41:26.280 --> 41:29.280
so maybe later on, they'll add it in there.

41:29.280 --> 41:31.280
But it says it sounds like a great idea.

41:31.280 --> 41:35.280
I don't think it's a great idea.

41:35.280 --> 41:38.280
I mean, I don't think they're going to do it,

41:38.280 --> 41:40.280
but it sounds like a cool idea.

41:40.280 --> 41:42.280
I think, if anything, if they're going to have that type of stuff,

41:42.280 --> 41:46.280
it's just going to be maybe tracks that you can download on DJ Hero,

41:46.280 --> 41:49.280
but I'll have the guitar and DJ element in there.

41:49.280 --> 41:52.280
And if you have an opinion on this or any other story we're going through tonight,

41:52.280 --> 41:55.280
1-877-GAME-OLR is the number to call,

41:55.280 --> 41:57.280
or our chat room is chat.orangelaungeready.com.

41:57.280 --> 42:00.280
But this makes me think about, I was playing rock band this weekend.

42:00.280 --> 42:03.280
You were over, we were checking out rock band,

42:03.280 --> 42:07.280
and I don't have room for a turntable on top of all the other crap

42:07.280 --> 42:11.280
that rock band, rock band, Guitar Hero, whatever,

42:11.280 --> 42:12.280
same thing these days, right?

42:12.280 --> 42:15.280
Well, not really, but same peripherals these days, right?

42:15.280 --> 42:19.280
I don't have room for a turntable and somebody else to see the TV

42:19.280 --> 42:21.280
on top of all that other stuff.

42:21.280 --> 42:23.280
I mean, that is almost, in a way, like too much stuff.

42:23.280 --> 42:26.280
I think it's one of those things, it's a nice idea in theory,

42:26.280 --> 42:29.280
and it enhances the value of these peripherals

42:29.280 --> 42:31.280
that we're dropping so much money on,

42:31.280 --> 42:34.280
but then I also think, how many songs really are going to make use out of this?

42:34.280 --> 42:39.280
How many turntable, rock hybrid songs can you think of?

42:39.280 --> 42:42.280
Besides, like, Walk This Way by Aerosmith and Run DMC?

42:42.280 --> 42:46.280
Well, there's a lot of, like, the Linkin Park stuff and stuff like that,

42:46.280 --> 42:47.280
maybe Korn or something.

42:47.280 --> 42:48.280
Okay, good point.

42:48.280 --> 42:53.280
But, yeah, it's a minority of the songs that are out there,

42:53.280 --> 42:55.280
and really, it's something I think that they would just support it

42:55.280 --> 42:58.280
with more tracks that are available through DJ Hero.

42:58.280 --> 43:02.280
And because DJ Hero is really about mixing music together,

43:02.280 --> 43:07.280
this would be more of kind of like adding a little triangle

43:07.280 --> 43:10.280
or something like that to Guitar Hero.

43:10.280 --> 43:14.280
It just, it wouldn't really be a big focus instrument for it

43:14.280 --> 43:16.280
unless they really went and did something.

43:16.280 --> 43:18.280
At that point, why would you bother doing that?

43:18.280 --> 43:22.280
Because you can't, I don't know, it'd be a lot of support for a game

43:22.280 --> 43:26.280
that they could just add more support to the existing DJ games

43:26.280 --> 43:28.280
to just get people to buy that instead,

43:28.280 --> 43:31.280
and there's no real point to have to support it anyways.

43:31.280 --> 43:34.280
You know, I still say you're going to be so limited with this, though.

43:34.280 --> 43:38.280
Okay, on my rock band, I have rock band two, rock band one,

43:38.280 --> 43:41.280
and I've got to have at least 40 to 50 download songs.

43:41.280 --> 43:43.280
I mean, I have a lot of download songs.

43:43.280 --> 43:46.280
I've given that company a lot of money, but they've earned it.

43:46.280 --> 43:48.280
A lot of fun nights there with rock band.

43:48.280 --> 43:52.280
Sometimes, when I have friends come over to play the game,

43:52.280 --> 43:55.280
they get up ready to sing, they scroll through the list

43:55.280 --> 43:57.280
and scroll and scroll and scroll and go,

43:57.280 --> 43:59.280
I can't really sing any of these songs.

43:59.280 --> 44:03.280
And I don't know how you guys do it when you play rock band,

44:03.280 --> 44:06.280
but I know that we let the singer always pick the song

44:06.280 --> 44:08.280
because they've probably got the hardest role.

44:08.280 --> 44:12.280
You know, guitar is pretty much the same, and drums are pretty much the same,

44:12.280 --> 44:14.280
and I assume turntable would be pretty much the same

44:14.280 --> 44:17.280
no matter what song you're choosing, but it's always up to the vocalist.

44:17.280 --> 44:20.280
And again, how much variety are you going to get

44:20.280 --> 44:24.280
if there's only like ten songs that are going to support the turntable and all this?

44:24.280 --> 44:27.280
It seems like, while it's a nice enhancement,

44:27.280 --> 44:30.280
it seems like effort that could be better spent somewhere else.

44:30.280 --> 44:33.280
And the only thing I could see, here would be a good idea.

44:33.280 --> 44:36.280
You would take a game, I don't think Guitar Hero is the right game for it,

44:36.280 --> 44:39.280
I think Band Hero would be the right game for it,

44:39.280 --> 44:42.280
because Band Hero is going to be more pop music,

44:42.280 --> 44:44.280
that has a lot more turntable stuff in it.

44:44.280 --> 44:46.280
Wait, there's actually a separate game called Band Hero?

44:46.280 --> 44:49.280
Yes there is, it's basically like Lego Rock Band,

44:49.280 --> 44:51.280
because Lego Rock Band is going to be more pop music.

44:51.280 --> 44:54.280
They had a demo, or they had a trailer for it at E3.

44:54.280 --> 44:57.280
I know, I remember seeing that trailer, I thought that...

44:57.280 --> 44:58.280
No, that's...

44:58.280 --> 45:00.280
Okay, call me stupid, laugh at me, I don't care,

45:00.280 --> 45:03.280
but I thought that was kind of like Guitar Hero 5's name.

45:03.280 --> 45:04.280
I thought it was the same thing.

45:04.280 --> 45:05.280
Nope.

45:05.280 --> 45:06.280
I thought they were just finally admitting,

45:06.280 --> 45:08.280
oh hey, Guitar Hero is not really a guitar game anymore,

45:08.280 --> 45:09.280
so they're calling it Band Hero.

45:09.280 --> 45:11.280
I thought it was Guitar Hero 5 Band Hero.

45:11.280 --> 45:18.280
Band Hero now is basically the pop, easy, family-friendly game or whatever,

45:18.280 --> 45:20.280
and they're going to have bundles and fun stuff for that.

45:20.280 --> 45:22.280
But I think that would be more appropriate for Band Hero,

45:22.280 --> 45:27.280
because then you could say have a download thing that adds DJ support in,

45:27.280 --> 45:33.280
if you have DJ Hero, or hey, if you want to be interesting with it, I guess,

45:33.280 --> 45:36.280
and since they don't really sell the instruments by themselves at the turntables,

45:36.280 --> 45:39.280
maybe if you have a DJ Hero save file or something like that,

45:39.280 --> 45:42.280
it detects it and it will allow you to play those games.

45:42.280 --> 45:48.280
Or maybe if you have, say, songs available,

45:48.280 --> 45:51.280
like download content or something that's Guitar Hero and DJs,

45:51.280 --> 45:53.280
that you can play it in Band Hero.

45:53.280 --> 45:54.280
Let me go to the phones.

45:54.280 --> 45:56.280
We have a call here on our Skype line.

45:56.280 --> 45:57.280
Hey, you're on Orange Lawn's radio.

45:57.280 --> 45:58.280
Who's this?

45:58.280 --> 45:59.280
Hey, it's Dan Shadow.

45:59.280 --> 46:00.280
Hey, Dan Shadow.

46:00.280 --> 46:03.280
What do you think of this whole thing, the turntables in Guitar Hero

46:03.280 --> 46:06.280
and Band Hero and all this?

46:06.280 --> 46:10.280
That wasn't really what I called it, but I just wanted to try it out.

46:10.280 --> 46:14.280
Isn't it the new Guitar Hero game, or was it Rock Band, Beatles,

46:14.280 --> 46:18.280
that lets you play multiple instruments in replacement of other instruments?

46:18.280 --> 46:20.280
That's like Guitar Hero 5.

46:20.280 --> 46:25.280
Yeah, because you were just mentioning the lead singer always rolls through

46:25.280 --> 46:29.280
whatever song they want and then, you know, it's like they play guitar

46:29.280 --> 46:32.280
and then no one wants to sing.

46:32.280 --> 46:35.280
I just think it's a good thing.

46:35.280 --> 46:38.280
The call is cutting in a little in and out.

46:38.280 --> 46:41.280
I think we have a bad connection, but I kind of get the point there

46:41.280 --> 46:46.280
that Guitar Hero 5 is kind of letting us do this more enhanced band thing

46:46.280 --> 46:48.280
where if nobody wants to sing, then great.

46:48.280 --> 46:50.280
We'll have two people play guitar.

46:50.280 --> 46:52.280
Of course, that's more peripherals.

46:52.280 --> 46:54.280
Hey, at this point you probably have enough.

46:54.280 --> 46:56.280
Yeah, tons of people own them at this point.

46:56.280 --> 46:58.280
You probably have enough, and hell, friends bring them over.

46:58.280 --> 47:00.280
I guess that's probably not going to be the problem.

47:00.280 --> 47:04.280
I can't see four drummers, but, you know, sure, why not?

47:04.280 --> 47:07.280
Yeah, I just wanted to chime in and say that's the biggest problem I have

47:07.280 --> 47:10.280
when I play Rock Band is that everyone wants to play one song.

47:10.280 --> 47:12.280
The singer doesn't want to play this song or whatever.

47:12.280 --> 47:15.280
Well, that's what I wanted to chime in on.

47:15.280 --> 47:17.280
Go ahead and keep on with your DJ conversation.

47:17.280 --> 47:20.280
No, hey, no worries, and don't worry.

47:20.280 --> 47:22.280
We are experimenting with a new format tonight,

47:22.280 --> 47:24.280
so if you want to call in while we were talking about stories,

47:24.280 --> 47:28.280
it's perfectly okay if folks kind of want to go back a few steps within the story.

47:28.280 --> 47:30.280
As long as somebody doesn't call in to say,

47:30.280 --> 47:33.280
hey, I want to talk about Doom while we're talking about Guitar Hero,

47:33.280 --> 47:35.280
we will have a space at the end of the show for folks

47:35.280 --> 47:37.280
that want to call in on any topic in the open bar.

47:37.280 --> 47:40.280
Thank you very much, Dan. Have a good night, okay?

47:40.280 --> 47:41.280
Have a good one, guys.

47:41.280 --> 47:43.280
The other thing I think they should do also,

47:43.280 --> 47:46.280
but I know they're not going to because they're going to exclude people that way,

47:46.280 --> 47:48.280
is they should have songs that require, okay,

47:48.280 --> 47:51.280
this song has two drummers and a DJ in it or something like that.

47:51.280 --> 47:54.280
Unique things. You can have the songs.

47:54.280 --> 47:58.280
Just like DJ Hero is doing, they're going to have ten songs

47:58.280 --> 48:00.280
that you can play guitar and DJ together.

48:00.280 --> 48:03.280
Well, let's have some songs that you can do,

48:03.280 --> 48:08.280
like say a DJ and then maybe two drummers and a singer or something.

48:08.280 --> 48:10.280
Something really ridiculous.

48:10.280 --> 48:13.280
It seems a bit much, but I think you're going to see some of these challenge things

48:13.280 --> 48:15.280
in Guitar Hero online.

48:15.280 --> 48:19.280
Here's a challenge. Do this challenge with four guitar players or something like that.

48:19.280 --> 48:21.280
I think that's where you're going to see something like that,

48:21.280 --> 48:23.280
but hold songs just for that.

48:23.280 --> 48:25.280
But all it really is is people playing together.

48:25.280 --> 48:28.280
It's the same thing. It's not like they're actually playing different parts.

48:28.280 --> 48:31.280
If you do four guitarists, unless someone picks bass,

48:31.280 --> 48:33.280
it's just going to be the same notes coming down.

48:33.280 --> 48:35.280
All right, TigerClaw in our chat.

48:35.280 --> 48:38.280
chat.orangelaunchradio.com is saying quite a bit about this.

48:38.280 --> 48:42.280
Very curious about what the Armin van Buuren DJ game is going to be like,

48:42.280 --> 48:45.280
which was oddly silent at E3, as was Scratch,

48:45.280 --> 48:48.280
although now we're starting to see videos of Scratch be released this week and more.

48:48.280 --> 48:50.280
I've already seen them.

48:50.280 --> 48:51.280
Very interesting.

48:51.280 --> 48:54.280
I want to read this comment from TigerClaw at chat.orangelaunchradio.com.

48:54.280 --> 48:57.280
Adding guitars to a live DJ set or any other instruments

48:57.280 --> 48:59.280
would make the mixes sound more lively.

48:59.280 --> 49:02.280
I've heard a couple of live DJ sets that have live violins,

49:02.280 --> 49:05.280
guitars, and all sorts of other instruments in the background,

49:05.280 --> 49:08.280
usually when you hear a big trance tune accompanied by a guitar

49:08.280 --> 49:10.280
during a breakdown or a buildup.

49:10.280 --> 49:12.280
I think a violin in a music game would be awesome.

49:12.280 --> 49:17.280
But when I read that, isn't that more going the other way,

49:17.280 --> 49:20.280
putting guitars in DJ Hero, which they're already talking about doing?

49:20.280 --> 49:22.280
Yes, and they are.

49:22.280 --> 49:26.280
I think that's a cool idea as well, but it's kind of the other way.

49:26.280 --> 49:30.280
It's putting guitars in DJ Hero because you're saying you're adding guitars.

49:30.280 --> 49:34.280
But, to be fair, a very interesting line that's being blurred.

49:34.280 --> 49:38.280
Would it be interesting if some of these songs were in both?

49:38.280 --> 49:40.280
That would be cool, and another cool thing would be

49:40.280 --> 49:44.280
you could have an option that there's ten songs in Guitar Hero 5

49:44.280 --> 49:47.280
that have DJ support on, so you all play as a band,

49:47.280 --> 49:50.280
but at the same time, the DJ is remixing the song,

49:50.280 --> 49:53.280
just adding beats and stuff to it.

49:53.280 --> 49:56.280
That would be kind of cool.

49:56.280 --> 49:59.280
Not something I think that they're going to do this time around,

49:59.280 --> 50:01.280
but it will be cool in the future.

50:01.280 --> 50:04.280
Sure, we're spending $120 on this game and a controller,

50:04.280 --> 50:07.280
so I'd hope I'd be able to use it in as many things as possible.

50:07.280 --> 50:10.280
We have the time dilation dude in chat says,

50:10.280 --> 50:12.280
again, we need more cowbell.

50:12.280 --> 50:14.280
That's true, when are we just going to get cowbell in these games?

50:14.280 --> 50:16.280
That's what we're waiting for.

50:16.280 --> 50:18.280
WeMusic has cowbell.

50:18.280 --> 50:21.280
Well, cowbell and that, but like in Rock Band and stuff like that

50:21.280 --> 50:22.280
where you can play the cymbals.

50:22.280 --> 50:25.280
Tambourine, sometimes it's a cowbell noise.

50:25.280 --> 50:29.280
Yeah, they should actually have cowbell.

50:29.280 --> 50:32.280
Kay Levster in our chat asks, is DJ Hero really going to work?

50:32.280 --> 50:34.280
I think it's going to be fun.

50:34.280 --> 50:37.280
I think it's going to be a fun game too, and it looks a lot of fun from the previews.

50:37.280 --> 50:38.280
I already got my order in.

50:38.280 --> 50:42.280
I mean, good thing, because I'm all about Rock Band.

50:42.280 --> 50:44.280
When it comes down to Rock Band vs Guitar Hero,

50:44.280 --> 50:46.280
right now I am totally in the Rock Band camp.

50:46.280 --> 50:48.280
I think it's the superior game.

50:48.280 --> 50:52.280
But, good thing for Activision, I'm highly interested by DJ Hero.

50:52.280 --> 50:53.280
I think it could be a good thing.

50:53.280 --> 50:57.280
And that has nothing to do with my prior obsession about BeatMania 2DX.

50:57.280 --> 51:00.280
If you're still saying, wait for the reviews, wait for the reviews.

51:00.280 --> 51:02.280
When the reviews come in on this game,

51:02.280 --> 51:06.280
if you see reviewers comparing DJ Hero to BeatMania 2DX,

51:06.280 --> 51:08.280
they are morons.

51:08.280 --> 51:10.280
The games look completely different,

51:10.280 --> 51:14.280
unless, granted, they quantify it with what makes them very different,

51:14.280 --> 51:16.280
because the games are very different.

51:16.280 --> 51:19.280
If you want a game that's like BeatMania 2DX, you're going to play Scratch.

51:19.280 --> 51:23.280
I mean, because that game is 2DX with better scratching.

51:23.280 --> 51:24.280
That's all it really is.

51:24.280 --> 51:26.280
And that's the kind of thing.

51:26.280 --> 51:30.280
I want to play both, because DJ Hero is more about mixing music together,

51:30.280 --> 51:35.280
which I like doing, and Scratch is more about scratching.

51:35.280 --> 51:40.280
It's really got the ability to do different techniques and stuff in there,

51:40.280 --> 51:42.280
and really kind of make the songs your own,

51:42.280 --> 51:45.280
instead of just kind of following note charts and stuff like that.

51:45.280 --> 51:51.280
But, yeah, in the end, Scratch is basically 2DX with better scratching.

51:51.280 --> 51:54.280
And DJ Dark Knight in chat says, G4 will, just you watch.

51:54.280 --> 51:55.280
Oh, I have no doubt.

51:55.280 --> 51:57.280
That's especially who I'm targeting that statement as.

51:57.280 --> 52:02.280
So if you're the person that writes the reviews that Morgan and Adam,

52:02.280 --> 52:04.280
or whatever their names are, read on X-Play,

52:04.280 --> 52:05.280
do not make that mistake.

52:05.280 --> 52:09.280
Like they did when they reviewed BeatMania on the PlayStation 2

52:09.280 --> 52:13.280
a couple years ago, saying it ripped off Guitar Hero.

52:13.280 --> 52:18.280
BeatMania's been around since 1997?

52:18.280 --> 52:22.280
Guitar Hero's been around since 2005?

52:22.280 --> 52:26.280
Well, if you need any evidence that it's really image first,

52:26.280 --> 52:29.280
and then knowledge second on G4.

52:29.280 --> 52:32.280
One of the hosts, I don't even know of what show,

52:32.280 --> 52:35.280
because I don't watch G4, but she's a Perian playboy,

52:35.280 --> 52:39.280
and she's promoting it on G4, so they get the cross-promotion there.

52:39.280 --> 52:43.280
But just because she's a pretty face to look at, that's about it.

52:43.280 --> 52:46.280
Well, remember, G4 is not a gaming network.

52:46.280 --> 52:47.280
Not anymore?

52:47.280 --> 52:49.280
Well, they haven't been for quite some time.

52:49.280 --> 52:52.280
We just need to remember, they are a network that caters to boys

52:52.280 --> 52:55.280
that have some gaming-related shows.

52:55.280 --> 52:57.280
They make a big presence at E3.

52:57.280 --> 53:00.280
I mean, they have their booth, and they run around and act goofy.

53:00.280 --> 53:02.280
But you know what?

53:02.280 --> 53:07.280
Sadly enough, I think Spike covers games better than G4.

53:07.280 --> 53:10.280
Well, because Spike is for big boys, and G4 is for little boys.

53:10.280 --> 53:12.280
Isn't that the way it's supposed to break down?

53:12.280 --> 53:15.280
And boys who like reality TV, like cops and cheaters.

53:15.280 --> 53:17.280
Not little boys, but you know what I mean?

53:17.280 --> 53:21.280
It's more for the teen and 21-ish audience, you know what I mean?

53:21.280 --> 53:24.280
It's G4's for frat dudes.

53:24.280 --> 53:25.280
That's what G4 is for.

53:25.280 --> 53:27.280
G4 doesn't really know what kind of a network it is.

53:27.280 --> 53:31.280
It's just experimenting to see what sticks is really what it is.

53:31.280 --> 53:33.280
Now, Deep Man says the E3 coverage is pretty good.

53:33.280 --> 53:36.280
And I do know people that will watch G4's E3 coverage.

53:36.280 --> 53:39.280
You know, and to be fair, they are like the only network

53:39.280 --> 53:42.280
that's making a 24-7 practically presence at E3.

53:42.280 --> 53:46.280
So I would actually almost agree, they probably do cover E3 better than anyone,

53:46.280 --> 53:49.280
because they devote so much time to it, you know?

53:49.280 --> 53:50.280
Yeah.

53:50.280 --> 53:52.280
So, all right.

53:52.280 --> 53:55.280
Xenocore in chat wants to clarify something, by the way.

53:55.280 --> 53:57.280
It's Olivia Munn. I don't know how we got on the G4 tangent,

53:57.280 --> 53:58.280
but it needs to stop.

53:58.280 --> 53:59.280
Yeah.

53:59.280 --> 54:00.280
No, that's all right.

54:00.280 --> 54:01.280
Just one last comment.

54:01.280 --> 54:04.280
Xenocore in chat says it's Olivia Munn, and she's not posing nude.

54:04.280 --> 54:08.280
Half the otaku geeks in the world are going to experience nerd rage.

54:08.280 --> 54:10.280
So, we'll see.

54:10.280 --> 54:12.280
Well, here's, look, we were talking about, you know,

54:12.280 --> 54:15.280
things we're really not interested in anymore.

54:15.280 --> 54:19.280
This just makes me think Guitar Hero, think even less of Guitar Hero,

54:19.280 --> 54:21.280
is Guitar Hero Van Halen.

54:21.280 --> 54:25.280
Look, I mean no disrespect to Van Halen, who obviously is one of the great,

54:25.280 --> 54:28.280
you know, a great, great band, even though they go through singers

54:28.280 --> 54:30.280
like Toilet Paper.

54:30.280 --> 54:34.280
The thing about Guitar Hero Van Halen is just that when I watch it,

54:34.280 --> 54:37.280
and you could watch it at E3 if you knew where to look at Sony's booth,

54:37.280 --> 54:39.280
as opposed to Activision's.

54:39.280 --> 54:43.280
When you watch it, you just can hear the cash cow mooing

54:43.280 --> 54:44.280
when you're watching the game.

54:44.280 --> 54:47.280
It's re-skinned Guitar Hero Metallica. It's all it is.

54:47.280 --> 54:50.280
And some more stories about this game that are coming out this week,

54:50.280 --> 54:52.280
just don't even make me feel that much better about it.

54:52.280 --> 54:55.280
Rolling Stone made a report earlier this week saying that

54:55.280 --> 54:59.280
apparently the game is exclusive to David Lee Roth as the lead singer.

54:59.280 --> 55:02.280
So, if you're expecting to hear like Right Now or something else

55:02.280 --> 55:04.280
out of the Sammy Hagar era, too bad.

55:04.280 --> 55:07.280
It's exclusive to the David Lee Roth era, which, you know,

55:07.280 --> 55:12.280
I'm sure many music fans would care to argue that Van Halen really was

55:12.280 --> 55:15.280
David Lee Roth and everything after that was just, you know,

55:15.280 --> 55:16.280
them trying to hold on.

55:16.280 --> 55:21.280
But, I don't know. They had some decent songs with the other lead singers.

55:21.280 --> 55:23.280
It kind of also makes you go,

55:23.280 --> 55:27.280
okay, well, how long was David Lee Roth really with them?

55:27.280 --> 55:30.280
So, where are they going to get all their songs from?

55:30.280 --> 55:33.280
And sure enough, if you start to kind of look at the song list,

55:33.280 --> 55:38.280
you know, while if you were a fan of Van Halen back in the 80s

55:38.280 --> 55:41.280
and David Lee Roth was around, you're going to be happy.

55:41.280 --> 55:47.280
There's, you know, a lot of room for those that have been following

55:47.280 --> 55:50.280
Van Halen later on, think the game could improve.

55:50.280 --> 55:52.280
So, and yes, as Marissa in chat says,

55:52.280 --> 55:54.280
it's Van Halen, not Van Hagar.

55:54.280 --> 56:00.280
And that, by the way, is exactly what Activision was quoted saying at one point.

56:00.280 --> 56:02.280
It's definitely Van Halen and not Van Hagar.

56:02.280 --> 56:05.280
Interesting.

56:05.280 --> 56:07.280
But I got to be honest.

56:07.280 --> 56:11.280
Again, I'm just, I'm not really an interesting guitar hero of Van Halen.

56:11.280 --> 56:15.280
If I was a hardcore Van Halen fan, I'd be all over this game.

56:15.280 --> 56:19.280
You know, just like, I don't expect probably any of our listeners bought Sing Star Abba,

56:19.280 --> 56:24.280
but I did, because I like Abba, and I'm not ashamed to admit it.

56:24.280 --> 56:28.280
But I'm probably, you know, again, Sing Star Abba probably, what was it?

56:28.280 --> 56:31.280
It was just really a 25-song expansion pack for Sing Star.

56:31.280 --> 56:33.280
There's not a damn thing new or special about it.

56:33.280 --> 56:34.280
You know what I want?

56:34.280 --> 56:36.280
They don't even pretend.

56:36.280 --> 56:42.280
I want Guitar Hero Huey Lewis and the News.

56:42.280 --> 56:44.280
That's some good music there.

56:44.280 --> 56:46.280
How about Guitar Hero Rick Roll Edition?

56:46.280 --> 56:48.280
There's really only one song to play in it.

56:48.280 --> 56:50.280
That's what we're moments away from becoming.

56:50.280 --> 56:54.280
Or Guitar Hero Kenny Loggins would be pretty cool, too.

56:54.280 --> 56:55.280
I don't know.

56:55.280 --> 56:56.280
All right.

56:56.280 --> 56:57.280
Well, there you go.

56:57.280 --> 57:01.280
Van Halen is, Guitar Hero Van Halen, not a game I'm very interested in in the future.

57:01.280 --> 57:04.280
Or hell, I'd just settle for some download content with those artists.

57:04.280 --> 57:06.280
I mean, that would be fine.

57:06.280 --> 57:08.280
And that's another thing, too, with Guitar Hero.

57:08.280 --> 57:15.280
I mean, I'm glad that they put out, you know, download content I think about every week.

57:15.280 --> 57:16.280
I'm not really sure.

57:16.280 --> 57:23.280
But a lot of these things could easily just be, I don't know, available for download.

57:23.280 --> 57:28.280
It's just like Rock Band, where they do the full album downloads and stuff like that.

57:28.280 --> 57:31.280
I mean, they could easily turn one of those into another game.

57:31.280 --> 57:38.280
Hey, let's take a full album, or a couple full albums of somebody, and let's add some other artists that they may have played with.

57:38.280 --> 57:40.280
And done. Game.

57:40.280 --> 57:45.280
And that's how they basically get the Guitar Hero artist games.

57:45.280 --> 57:47.280
But really, yeah.

57:47.280 --> 57:51.280
Granted, there's the Beatles Rock Band, but that's completely different.

57:51.280 --> 57:58.280
I mean, they changed up the whole style of it, and it's a different kind of type of gameplay.

57:58.280 --> 58:03.280
And then there's also Lego Rock Band, which is a little bit kind of a whoring of the franchise.

58:03.280 --> 58:07.280
But I mean, it is more family-friendly, and it does look completely different.

58:07.280 --> 58:10.280
And they're going to have a different type of music in there.

58:10.280 --> 58:11.280
But yeah, you know.

58:11.280 --> 58:15.280
Have they said, and I, you know, this is probably even something we've covered on the show, but I'm just so out of it.

58:15.280 --> 58:19.280
Lego Rock Band is independent of the, oh no, I remember this guy brought up.

58:19.280 --> 58:21.280
Lego Rock Band's list, you can't import it into the other games, can you?

58:21.280 --> 58:22.280
Nope, different publisher.

58:22.280 --> 58:24.280
That's right, because all the, yeah, I remember this.

58:24.280 --> 58:26.280
This came up last week.

58:26.280 --> 58:28.280
But I don't know if I'm really interested in Lego Rock Band.

58:28.280 --> 58:29.280
I don't think I am.

58:29.280 --> 58:31.280
Beatles Rock Band, I'm all over that shit.

58:31.280 --> 58:33.280
That game looked amazing.

58:33.280 --> 58:35.280
And I'm not even a hardcore Beatles fan.

58:35.280 --> 58:37.280
I don't even think I've ever owned a Beatles album.

58:37.280 --> 58:42.280
I like to, you know, obviously I think John Lennon was a great man, as were, you know, all the Beatles.

58:42.280 --> 58:44.280
And you know, especially they do a lot of great humanitarian work now.

58:44.280 --> 58:49.280
They have timeless classics, and you know, you hear the songs, they're just so embedded in our culture.

58:49.280 --> 58:55.280
You can't help but not, but the game just looked like, wow, this is not just a cheap re-skinning.

58:55.280 --> 59:01.280
Somebody really sat down at a table and thought, okay, how do we make, like not just how do we slap the Beatles in this game,

59:01.280 --> 59:05.280
but how do we make a game about the Beatles in this franchise?

59:05.280 --> 59:07.280
That's what really kind of made that game special.

59:07.280 --> 59:08.280
It's effort, it's level of effort.

59:08.280 --> 59:12.280
It's not just, okay, we took out Metallica, put in Van Halen, done.

59:12.280 --> 59:16.280
Whereas I think Lego Rock Band was, okay, let's just slap Legos in Rock Band.

59:16.280 --> 59:17.280
Yes.

59:17.280 --> 59:18.280
Make it a family friendly franchise.

59:18.280 --> 59:21.280
That is about as much effort as, you know, the Guitar Hero Van Halen.

59:21.280 --> 59:27.280
But you all give it to them because that's one game, that's not like Guitar Hero Metallica, Guitar Hero Smash Hits,

59:27.280 --> 59:32.280
Guitar Hero Van Halen, Guitar Hero 5, Guitar Hero Band Hero.

59:32.280 --> 59:33.280
Guitar Hero Aerosmith.

59:33.280 --> 59:36.280
Guitar Hero Aerosmith, well that's, I'm talking about this year basically.

59:36.280 --> 59:37.280
Oh, okay, sorry.

59:37.280 --> 59:42.280
I mean, you know, Guitar Hero for the DS, which just came out, On Tour 3.

59:42.280 --> 59:47.280
Guitar Hero, which you'll probably have an On Tour 4 by the time we get to November.

59:47.280 --> 59:51.280
It's just, it's too much.

59:51.280 --> 59:52.280
Too much in one year.

59:52.280 --> 59:54.280
I mean, God, space this stuff out.

59:54.280 --> 59:55.280
Add it as download content.

59:55.280 --> 01:00:01.280
Thank you for, you know, allowing the World Tour downloads to be available in Guitar Hero 5.

01:00:01.280 --> 01:00:10.280
Unfortunately, you can't import the whole Guitar Hero World Tour, you know, song list into Guitar Hero 5 like you can with Rock Band 1 and Rock Band 2.

01:00:10.280 --> 01:00:19.280
And assuming that it all stays the same, Rock Band 3, which you just build one continuous big song list, which I think is a great idea.

01:00:19.280 --> 01:00:21.280
Do you think we'll get Rock Band 3 next year?

01:00:21.280 --> 01:00:22.280
Maybe.

01:00:22.280 --> 01:00:30.280
I think we will get Rock Band 3 because they're going to do three-bar harmonies in Rock Band and they may add some different stuff into it.

01:00:30.280 --> 01:00:31.280
Who knows?

01:00:31.280 --> 01:00:32.280
But I think there will be a new one next year.

01:00:32.280 --> 01:00:35.280
I'm still hoping for a keyboard someday, but I know, fat chance.

01:00:35.280 --> 01:00:36.280
Fat chance.

01:00:36.280 --> 01:00:39.280
Alright, we're about an hour into tonight's show, so let's move on.

01:00:39.280 --> 01:00:42.280
We've still got a couple more stories to go over.

01:00:42.280 --> 01:00:49.280
We have no idea how long tonight's show is going to take, by the way, with this whole new format, but we're right on about the same usual time right now.

01:00:49.280 --> 01:00:52.280
We've got a few more stories we want to go over with you guys, though.

01:00:52.280 --> 01:00:56.280
And remember, you can call in at any time 1-877-GAME-OLR.

01:00:56.280 --> 01:01:00.280
We are going to get past Guitar Hero and Loki's going to take us in a different direction.

01:01:00.280 --> 01:01:01.280
Yes.

01:01:01.280 --> 01:01:03.280
Now we're going to talk about hardware.

01:01:03.280 --> 01:01:11.280
You've probably heard a lot of game companies touting that their game has maxed out the hardware of the PS3 or the Xbox 360.

01:01:11.280 --> 01:01:21.280
Well, according to Richard Parr, who works at Criterion, he's basically said the proof is that you're not the best.

01:01:21.280 --> 01:01:24.280
Basically, it means that you're out of ideas.

01:01:24.280 --> 01:01:27.280
You always find new ways to do things.

01:01:27.280 --> 01:01:33.280
The constraints lift, not just with the new console generation, but with every game you do.

01:01:33.280 --> 01:01:34.280
And I agree with him.

01:01:34.280 --> 01:01:39.280
You look at games like Crysis that maxed out all the PCs out there, basically.

01:01:39.280 --> 01:01:48.280
Just ridiculous stuff that you throw at it because you have three graphics cards in there, high-end processor, all the RAM you could possibly throw at it.

01:01:48.280 --> 01:01:50.280
And it runs just kind of good.

01:01:50.280 --> 01:01:52.280
Not great, but good.

01:01:52.280 --> 01:01:53.280
And you know why?

01:01:53.280 --> 01:01:56.280
It's because they didn't optimize their code for shit.

01:01:56.280 --> 01:01:59.280
And then when Crysis Wars comes out, oh, look at that!

01:01:59.280 --> 01:02:01.280
It's the same damn game, basically.

01:02:01.280 --> 01:02:03.280
And it runs great on all these PCs.

01:02:03.280 --> 01:02:04.280
Wonder why that was?

01:02:04.280 --> 01:02:07.280
Oh, it's because we actually optimized our code this time.

01:02:07.280 --> 01:02:23.280
So really, I think that they are able to push out more code, better detail, better processing power out of these games, just by the effort and tricks that they learned along the way.

01:02:23.280 --> 01:02:36.280
Learn to optimize their code, learn to optimize their engines that they run in, and just kind of figure out ways to use every bit of the console's power.

01:02:36.280 --> 01:02:43.280
You know, it's interesting because it's challenging people to kind of think within the constraints that you might already have.

01:02:43.280 --> 01:02:45.280
You know, you've got to innovate with what you've already got.

01:02:45.280 --> 01:02:51.280
It kind of makes me think about why do games still continue to come out for the Dreamcast and all this?

01:02:51.280 --> 01:02:55.280
Because there's a big independence scene on the Dreamcast, not necessarily because they're putting out better games.

01:02:55.280 --> 01:03:00.280
But I think a better example would be looking at what we're seeing this year for the Wii.

01:03:00.280 --> 01:03:04.280
I mean, look at Red Steel 2.

01:03:04.280 --> 01:03:06.280
I mean, Red Steel 2 looks awesome.

01:03:06.280 --> 01:03:08.280
It runs at 60 frames per second.

01:03:08.280 --> 01:03:10.280
The graphics are pretty great on it.

01:03:10.280 --> 01:03:16.280
I mean, it looks like something that could probably be on a 360 or a PS3, but they're doing it on the Wii.

01:03:16.280 --> 01:03:23.280
And before, you know, no one thought that that was possible, even with something like the Metroid Other M.

01:03:23.280 --> 01:03:28.280
I mean, that looks like that could be easily on a 360 or something like that, at least from the videos I've seen.

01:03:28.280 --> 01:03:31.280
And some of these other games look really good.

01:03:31.280 --> 01:03:34.280
They're running at 60 frames per second and stuff like that on the Wii.

01:03:34.280 --> 01:03:41.280
You know, a big one that was, I want to say, the Conduit.

01:03:41.280 --> 01:03:46.280
The Conduit's another one that pushed the engine really well on the Wii.

01:03:46.280 --> 01:03:47.280
And they said, oh yeah, we maxed it out.

01:03:47.280 --> 01:03:53.280
But guess what? They came out with some better games now, other games that they're coming out after Conduit.

01:03:53.280 --> 01:03:56.280
And they're even better.

01:03:56.280 --> 01:04:01.280
Well, you mentioning Metroid made me think of F-Zero on the GameCube, and I love F-Zero.

01:04:01.280 --> 01:04:05.280
I think that was just an awesome game, especially that particular one that was on the GameCube.

01:04:05.280 --> 01:04:10.280
And it looked great, and at the time did something that was almost unheard of on the GameCube.

01:04:10.280 --> 01:04:16.280
It supported widescreen 480 progression, the same resolution that the Wii does.

01:04:16.280 --> 01:04:21.280
Yet, I see so many Wii games that don't look as good as F-Zero GX did.

01:04:21.280 --> 01:04:23.280
PlayStation 2, there was Gran Turismo 4.

01:04:23.280 --> 01:04:28.280
It supported 1080i on the PlayStation 2.

01:04:28.280 --> 01:04:31.280
Wow, I didn't even realize that.

01:04:31.280 --> 01:04:37.280
Who's to say that these consoles, who's to say that you couldn't develop a Wii game that could support those higher resolutions?

01:04:37.280 --> 01:04:43.280
They could do it. I mean, hell, if a PlayStation 2 can do it, why can't the Wii? It's got better specs in it.

01:04:43.280 --> 01:04:47.280
Well, maybe, well, for one, the Wii has no HDMI, but I guess they do have that particular output.

01:04:47.280 --> 01:04:49.280
It doesn't matter. They have component out.

01:04:49.280 --> 01:04:50.280
Interesting. I don't know.

01:04:50.280 --> 01:04:54.280
You could do 1080p over component. Or just do 1080i. Or even, let's just, naive...

01:04:54.280 --> 01:04:58.280
I don't know enough about the tech end to really know. Is there something within the hardware that has to enable it?

01:04:58.280 --> 01:05:09.280
It's memory bandwidth. Basically, you're limited to the memory, the video memory, and the video processor for those consoles to be able to push out textures and stuff like that.

01:05:09.280 --> 01:05:12.280
But I think maybe 720p, maybe that's doable.

01:05:12.280 --> 01:05:18.280
And if you want to call us on this topic about consoles pushing their limits, do they still have a ways to go or what have you?

01:05:18.280 --> 01:05:22.280
1877 game OLR is the number to call. Or chat.org.

01:05:22.280 --> 01:05:32.280
Or you can do better resolution, like 720p, but maybe Letterbox is down some so that it's not using as much RAM, maybe.

01:05:32.280 --> 01:05:36.280
Just black bars on top and bottom or something like that.

01:05:36.280 --> 01:05:43.280
But maybe a hybrid resolution, like 540p or something weird. I don't know. Maybe that's possible.

01:05:43.280 --> 01:05:52.280
Tigerclaw in chat says, you can do 1080p over component if the TV supports it. Most TV won't allow 1080p over component because it doesn't support HDCP.

01:05:52.280 --> 01:05:58.280
That's fine. But let's just do 720p then, for argument's sake. Because 720 still looks great.

01:05:58.280 --> 01:06:07.280
It's interesting because a lot of these, you gotta be careful too. There's a lot of cheap HDTVs out there. They're only capable of 720. They don't even do the 1080 at all.

01:06:07.280 --> 01:06:15.280
But yeah, 720 is still considered HD. Right? So what's to say you can't do 720 on the Wii?

01:06:15.280 --> 01:06:17.280
It'd be interesting if that's possible.

01:06:17.280 --> 01:06:24.280
It's really just forward thinking and I don't think that they're gonna do that because, guess what, they think that their audience doesn't care.

01:06:24.280 --> 01:06:31.280
And that's sad because they could do that and they could push the technology to maybe do that.

01:06:31.280 --> 01:06:41.280
And this one comment here is gonna take this conversation in a different direction. Watch this. Gameguru in chat says, graphical power is overrated.

01:06:41.280 --> 01:06:50.280
Yes, Wii's new AV port has four connections that aren't used. But go back to, graphical power is overrated. Isn't that what this is really all about in a way though?

01:06:50.280 --> 01:06:57.280
Is that, do you really have to have the most cutting edge? Do we even really need this talk about HD on the Wii and all this stuff?

01:06:57.280 --> 01:07:00.280
Shouldn't we just have the fun game?

01:07:00.280 --> 01:07:04.280
True, but that's also how they're getting around some of this stuff too.

01:07:04.280 --> 01:07:12.280
Because you'll notice, like Mad World, full 3D game, ran pretty good. Black and white, that's the way they got around.

01:07:12.280 --> 01:07:17.280
It's a different art style so they didn't have to push the detail and stuff like that.

01:07:17.280 --> 01:07:21.280
Red Steel 2, they're going with a comic book or maybe cel shaded look to it.

01:07:21.280 --> 01:07:28.280
Another way that they've gotten around having to have really detailed textures and stuff like that, you save on texture memory that way.

01:07:28.280 --> 01:07:31.280
I was thinking more like, games don't have to have great graphics to be fun.

01:07:31.280 --> 01:07:37.280
They don't, but you should be able to do that if you're a developer and you want to push that out.

01:07:37.280 --> 01:07:43.280
For real, how many fucking people are playing that Plants vs. Zombies game from PopCap right now?

01:07:43.280 --> 01:07:44.280
Too many.

01:07:44.280 --> 01:07:51.280
Billions and billions of people are playing that Plants vs. Zombies, creating zombies, that game is.

01:07:51.280 --> 01:07:57.280
Not the greatest graphics in the world, a game that probably could have come out on the Super Nintendo, right?

01:07:57.280 --> 01:07:58.280
Yes.

01:07:58.280 --> 01:08:04.280
But, huge. And it adapts to so many different types of audiences too.

01:08:04.280 --> 01:08:12.280
You know what I mean? Soccer moms play this on their break at work and even some of the hardcore gamers are all about plants and zombies.

01:08:12.280 --> 01:08:18.280
When we went to that Windows 7 demo thingy at E3 that was off site, you know what one of those guys was testing out on the computer?

01:08:18.280 --> 01:08:20.280
Plants vs. Zombies.

01:08:20.280 --> 01:08:27.280
Yeah, exactly. And you know what would be funny, and I've always been saying this, why can't they take the Wii and say, give us a 2D Metroid?

01:08:27.280 --> 01:08:32.280
Just, you know, that way you don't even have to worry about it, you know? Hell, you could reuse the sprites.

01:08:32.280 --> 01:08:36.280
Just make a 2D Metroid that knocks me on my fucking ass. Like, really.

01:08:36.280 --> 01:08:44.280
Just blow me away with the sound, the story, do beautiful Joey things with the 2D graphics, I don't know, whatever.

01:08:44.280 --> 01:08:50.280
The one game I've been playing this week more than any other is Final Fantasy IV The After Years.

01:08:50.280 --> 01:08:53.280
The graphics on par with Super Nintendo.

01:08:53.280 --> 01:08:54.280
Yeah.

01:08:54.280 --> 01:09:03.280
But, I'm very interested in the story. Now granted, a lot of this is because I love Final Fantasy IV and I'm very nostalgic for it, so to have the story keep going is great.

01:09:03.280 --> 01:09:11.280
It's great though, because think about it though, if you did that with the Wii, you could actually reuse assets. You saved development time right there.

01:09:11.280 --> 01:09:19.280
I mean, you can reuse assets, you can create new things, but you can just, you know, build upon it. Remember Sammit, what was it, Metroid Zero or whatever?

01:09:19.280 --> 01:09:21.280
Zero Mission, I believe.

01:09:21.280 --> 01:09:27.280
You know, basically Super Metroid, there is some differences in there, but then there is this whole after part.

01:09:27.280 --> 01:09:30.280
I want to read this lengthy comment from Xenocore because I think it's a good one.

01:09:30.280 --> 01:09:35.280
As much as this guy may have a point, this quote has merit, but only as far as what the rest of the game is doing.

01:09:35.280 --> 01:09:41.280
This console has been maxed if you consider what else the console is doing while it's rendering graphics.

01:09:41.280 --> 01:09:48.280
If a game isn't as intensive in driving AI or keeping objects in memory, fighters have more room for graphics than a simulation does.

01:09:48.280 --> 01:09:53.280
Chat.orangelandraday.com if you want to comment. Or 1877 game OLR.

01:09:53.280 --> 01:09:59.280
That's true. It doesn't. I mean, you could have, it's all how they use it. All the different tricks.

01:09:59.280 --> 01:10:05.280
I like this comment from Dan Shadow. Who cares about graphics when Scribblenauts is coming?

01:10:05.280 --> 01:10:09.280
That's true. Scribblenauts is going to be awesome. How are they going to do a sequel to that game?

01:10:09.280 --> 01:10:16.280
I don't know. Hey, make a game like that on Xbox or something where when you put in bacon, it's real bacon.

01:10:16.280 --> 01:10:20.280
It doesn't look like cartoony bacon, but real bacon.

01:10:20.280 --> 01:10:22.280
Wishful thinking?

01:10:22.280 --> 01:10:28.280
Too bad they couldn't do like a fighting game like that. Where you're just fighting and all of a sudden you just summon different things.

01:10:28.280 --> 01:10:34.280
You know what though? I got to admit, as much as the Scribblenauts demo made me teehee when I was watching it at E3,

01:10:34.280 --> 01:10:41.280
I do remain a little skeptical about how fun it's really going to be. Like the longevity is what I remain skeptical about.

01:10:41.280 --> 01:10:50.280
You got to remember folks, remember, go back in the archives of this show back to 2006, I think.

01:10:50.280 --> 01:10:57.280
I said Nintendogs was the best thing I played at E3. It's going to be the most amazing game when it comes out.

01:10:57.280 --> 01:11:03.280
It's going to be awesome. Just all these things you can do is just going to be amazing. Nintendogs is going to blow away your fucking mind.

01:11:03.280 --> 01:11:10.280
And then when the game came out, bored now, two hours in. Like it was the type of game where I'd seen it all at E3.

01:11:10.280 --> 01:11:16.280
So I just, you know, I'm not, I haven't played Scribblenauts. I'm not saying knocking it. I'm just saying, skeptical.

01:11:16.280 --> 01:11:21.280
For me, drawing the life. Another perfect one. Oh, I can draw my character? That's awesome.

01:11:21.280 --> 01:11:30.280
Did that, and got bored. Same developer even. But this I think will be fun, if not just the show to your friends.

01:11:30.280 --> 01:11:34.280
Hey, look at that, huh, Cthulhu. You know, just screwing around with that. And hey, why not?

01:11:34.280 --> 01:11:41.280
You know, they should have a game that's just like a sandbox type thing where you can just create your own scenarios, you know, do whatever.

01:11:41.280 --> 01:11:50.280
Bandit in our chatroom asks, why is the Wii $99 for God's sake? Good question. Or why, I'm sorry, why isn't the Wii? Sorry, my bad.

01:11:50.280 --> 01:11:55.280
Why isn't the Wii $99 for God's sake? Because they want to make money off of every console.

01:11:55.280 --> 01:12:02.280
Yeah, I mean, because people are still buying it when it's $250. Because they're ignorant, because they think that they can, you know,

01:12:02.280 --> 01:12:15.280
I mean, look at that. The Xbox 360 is $50 cheaper than them. But you know what? They're so arrogant, I guess, and confident in their system that they just say, eh, whatever.

01:12:15.280 --> 01:12:22.280
We're not competing with anybody. We're not part of the next gen, remember that quote? They're not part of the next gen.

01:12:22.280 --> 01:12:28.280
We're a different gen. But no, it really comes down to because the game is still selling. That's the reason why.

01:12:28.280 --> 01:12:36.280
Alright, let's move on. We have a lot of ground to cover before we get to break here. And this next story is about the Xbox 360's Project Natal,

01:12:36.280 --> 01:12:44.280
which obviously was one of the highly talked about things that you three this year. The rumor going around this week is that Xbox Natal might actually be

01:12:44.280 --> 01:12:55.280
the next Microsoft console. It might not be something that you buy to enhance with your 360, but it might actually be a whole new type of console.

01:12:55.280 --> 01:13:02.280
Where does this come from? Well, this comes from a story reported on OneUp.com through their Listen Up podcast.

01:13:02.280 --> 01:13:12.280
They were talking about Project Natal and some of the folks were talking about the games. And apparently, Microsoft is not only planning on releasing Natal as an add-on for the Xbox 360,

01:13:12.280 --> 01:13:20.280
but possibly releasing it as standard with the next Xbox console. But they're saying this new console is not just going to be, like it's not a repackaging.

01:13:20.280 --> 01:13:28.280
It's not a new SKU. It's not the power set that comes with more than just the thing itself.

01:13:28.280 --> 01:13:39.280
But that they're talking about that this new Xbox could actually be called Xbox Natal and that it's going to be having some added oomph actually in the system itself.

01:13:39.280 --> 01:13:48.280
You see rumors going around about how Xbox is going to have these new chipsets in them soon that apparently they're not going to be making as much noise.

01:13:48.280 --> 01:13:56.280
They're combining the GPU and all this into one chipset so that it won't be as noisy and they can make the size go down a little bit.

01:13:56.280 --> 01:14:01.280
So that maybe the Xbox 360 Slim is actually going to be this whole new console.

01:14:01.280 --> 01:14:09.280
Loki, what do you think? I mean, it makes sense that they might redesign the console to be smaller. I don't think it's going to be the next console though.

01:14:09.280 --> 01:14:16.280
I don't think they're going to increase the specs on it or anything because they can't because they would alienate half their audience basically.

01:14:16.280 --> 01:14:26.280
I do think that maybe later on if this takes off like they think it's going to take off, then yeah, it probably will be bundled with all the Xbox 360 consoles as they come out.

01:14:26.280 --> 01:14:33.280
It'll be just like a controller. I mean, that sounds right. I think a lot of people are getting caught off guard with the whole,

01:14:33.280 --> 01:14:38.280
we're going to treat the Natal launch like we're going to treat a console launch.

01:14:38.280 --> 01:14:40.280
That they're going to put a lot of marketing buzz behind it.

01:14:40.280 --> 01:14:47.280
Yeah, it kind of is a big thing because if it does exactly what it's showing that it's supposed to be able to do, then yeah, that is a big thing.

01:14:47.280 --> 01:14:52.280
That might get a lot of people interested and they really want to take away that market share that the Wii has.

01:14:52.280 --> 01:14:59.280
And maybe possibly capture some of these people that have never played games before because that's what kind of the Wii did.

01:14:59.280 --> 01:15:05.280
It's like, oh my god, I can play tennis like I can play tennis. Or I can bowl like I can really bowl.

01:15:05.280 --> 01:15:11.280
But this is like, I can bowl and I don't need the whole controller. I don't even need to figure that out. I just do it.

01:15:11.280 --> 01:15:15.280
Well now, here's something else to consider where they're going with this.

01:15:15.280 --> 01:15:21.280
Why has the Wii been so successful? Because they've been catering to the soccer moms, to the family audience.

01:15:21.280 --> 01:15:28.280
Now, there are rumors out there, and I say believe them, that Nintendo's coming out with a new Wii in 2011.

01:15:28.280 --> 01:15:32.280
Wii HD. There's rumors about behind closed doors, showing to companies, and so on.

01:15:32.280 --> 01:15:36.280
And I say believe them. Nintendo's the one that's got some catching up to do.

01:15:36.280 --> 01:15:43.280
You know, if they don't think two steps ahead, they're going to get blown away by some of these new developments in the 360, especially with the 360's price point.

01:15:43.280 --> 01:15:52.280
And here's the thing is that, let's say 360 relaunches this thing, and now they sell a slim Xbox that has Natal in it,

01:15:52.280 --> 01:16:00.280
that is catered at a family audience, at a lower price point possibly, or an equal price point with the Nintendo Wii.

01:16:00.280 --> 01:16:10.280
Now Nintendo's in trouble. So I think it's very interesting, you know, obviously, Microsoft is not content with being number two, or whatever they are right now.

01:16:10.280 --> 01:16:15.280
I mean, I guess it's arguable, you look at the world picture, whatever. They are not, but they're not in America.

01:16:15.280 --> 01:16:16.280
In the world.

01:16:16.280 --> 01:16:17.280
Are they really?

01:16:17.280 --> 01:16:18.280
Yeah.

01:16:18.280 --> 01:16:19.280
But like Japan, they're certainly not.

01:16:19.280 --> 01:16:22.280
Well yeah, but you know, that doesn't matter, their market share is really small.

01:16:22.280 --> 01:16:29.280
Okay, well whatever, I don't want to get into, this isn't about 360 versus Sony right now, this is about Microsoft wanting to be number one.

01:16:29.280 --> 01:16:37.280
And they're looking at how did Nintendo do it, and watch, when this thing launches, this is tall, it's going to be launched at families again.

01:16:37.280 --> 01:16:44.280
But it's going to be interesting, because now they will still have that whole hardcore gamer, whereas Wii's going to be going in reverse.

01:16:44.280 --> 01:16:49.280
They'll already probably have the buy-in from the family audience, they're going to need to get the hardcore gamers back on board.

01:16:49.280 --> 01:16:56.280
That's really going to be tough, because I think Microsoft gets it though, because if you think about it, look at what they're showing off.

01:16:56.280 --> 01:17:00.280
All the games that they're showing off are really to their core audience that's already there.

01:17:00.280 --> 01:17:06.280
Games that everybody that I think owns the 360, for the most part, that's going to be something that you're going to be excited about.

01:17:06.280 --> 01:17:11.280
Now, Natal is really kind of just to gather those people that may be on the Wii and stuff.

01:17:11.280 --> 01:17:24.280
But the Wii, everybody that owns it, I mean granted there's games that you're looking forward to, but I know myself, I'm not going to be, other than Metroid, other M, and that's kind of iffy on that one.

01:17:24.280 --> 01:17:29.280
I don't have faith in them that they're going to really put out something that's going to make me go,

01:17:29.280 --> 01:17:40.280
Oh my god, this is so awesome, this is the greatest game I have ever played, you know, type thing. I think they're just going to keep churning this crap that's been coming out year after year.

01:17:40.280 --> 01:17:48.280
Aimed at more family gamers, and good for them if they think that's what they need to do, but as far as my budget goes, I'm not spending money on this.

01:17:48.280 --> 01:17:57.280
So much in chat I want to cover right now. Chat.orensonsheridge.com, and if you want to call in, please do 1-877-GAMEOLR if you want to talk about Project Natal and this whole rumor about the new system.

01:17:57.280 --> 01:18:08.280
Oh god, where to even begin here, there's so much I want to talk about. First off, folks in chat say, Wii HD next year, no no no, 2011 is when they're saying it's coming out.

01:18:08.280 --> 01:18:13.280
But Game Guru in chat says, no I don't see Wii HD coming out until the next generation.

01:18:13.280 --> 01:18:17.280
But what I want to say to that is, who's to say where the generations are anymore?

01:18:17.280 --> 01:18:29.280
I mean, what's interesting about what we've got with this current crop of systems is that they are entertainment devices in your living room, especially PlayStation 3.

01:18:29.280 --> 01:18:36.280
You know, their biggest thing right now is the fact that it's a Blu-Ray player, and does a lot of these things right out of the living room.

01:18:36.280 --> 01:18:41.280
You know, who's to say where the next generation is even going to begin?

01:18:41.280 --> 01:18:54.280
Because we have yet to really max out this generation in some ways, but I don't know if there's necessarily going to be a hard line that defines the next generation of gaming after this one, I guess is what I'm getting at.

01:18:54.280 --> 01:18:59.280
Because right now the war is about enhancing this current one, which we didn't really have before.

01:18:59.280 --> 01:19:04.280
You know, when you had a Super Nintendo, you might have the occasional peripheral to enhance it, but that's it.

01:19:04.280 --> 01:19:11.280
It's basically now they're trying to push their consoles to a 10-year life cycle, is really what it is.

01:19:11.280 --> 01:19:16.280
And if that's the case, then we're going to be playing with the Xbox 360 until 2015.

01:19:16.280 --> 01:19:27.280
So, you know, they've got to do something now because they're not necessarily running out of ideas, but they need to expand the possibilities with these new platforms.

01:19:27.280 --> 01:19:35.280
So you're going to see stuff like the motion controllers coming out from Sony and from Microsoft, and you're going to see the enhancements to the console from the Wii.

01:19:35.280 --> 01:19:42.280
Because it's technically not a new system, it's just an enhancement, like the DS and the DSi and the DS Lite.

01:19:42.280 --> 01:19:45.280
Okay, I got to say this, I got to say this, because this is it right here.

01:19:45.280 --> 01:19:51.280
GameGuru says, admittedly, it might be the next generation with MotionPlus, Natal, and PSMote.

01:19:51.280 --> 01:19:57.280
And I'm almost on board with you there, but change MotionPlus to Wii HD, and there you have it.

01:19:57.280 --> 01:20:00.280
That's why I do think Wii HD is out sooner than later.

01:20:00.280 --> 01:20:02.280
What is this all about? Leveling the playfield.

01:20:02.280 --> 01:20:06.280
Xbox, Sony will now have motion control.

01:20:06.280 --> 01:20:08.280
Wii will now have high definition.

01:20:08.280 --> 01:20:11.280
Now it's a war.

01:20:11.280 --> 01:20:13.280
Now it's a war.

01:20:13.280 --> 01:20:22.280
GameGuru also says in chat, and I'm sorry to keep quoting from the same person, but just a lot of thought-provoking comments, so props to you.

01:20:22.280 --> 01:20:25.280
However, a price drop is due by 2010.

01:20:25.280 --> 01:20:29.280
Natal will bomb with the Family Gamer, Xbox has its stereotype.

01:20:29.280 --> 01:20:31.280
I couldn't disagree more.

01:20:31.280 --> 01:20:34.280
Not necessarily that Natal will bomb with the Family Gamer, I don't know yet.

01:20:34.280 --> 01:20:37.280
It's too early to see until we start really seeing the games.

01:20:37.280 --> 01:20:41.280
You can't base everything off the Milo demo and some of these limited things we saw.

01:20:41.280 --> 01:20:44.280
But Xbox having a stereotype to overcome, they can do it.

01:20:44.280 --> 01:20:46.280
Hell yeah, they can do it.

01:20:46.280 --> 01:20:48.280
And I'm not trying to sound like a fanboy or anything.

01:20:48.280 --> 01:20:50.280
I'm saying, you go back.

01:20:50.280 --> 01:20:54.280
The nice thing about this show being around for seven years, you go back to some of those older episodes.

01:20:54.280 --> 01:20:56.280
My God, did we make fun of the Xbox.

01:20:56.280 --> 01:20:58.280
Oh my God, the X-Brick.

01:20:58.280 --> 01:21:00.280
What a fat system.

01:21:00.280 --> 01:21:01.280
What a useless system.

01:21:01.280 --> 01:21:03.280
There isn't a fucking game on it I want to play.

01:21:03.280 --> 01:21:04.280
This is a piece of shit.

01:21:04.280 --> 01:21:06.280
Who wants to buy this console?

01:21:06.280 --> 01:21:08.280
This is just a PC in a box.

01:21:08.280 --> 01:21:10.280
There's not a damn thing on this worth playing.

01:21:10.280 --> 01:21:17.280
These are things that I'm sure we all said about that original, black, gigantic Xbox One.

01:21:17.280 --> 01:21:19.280
But look how far they've come.

01:21:19.280 --> 01:21:21.280
They won me over.

01:21:21.280 --> 01:21:26.280
One of the games I played this week, which I didn't even get to in my gaming week, One vs. 100.

01:21:26.280 --> 01:21:30.280
Which, I don't know how much I've ranted on this show before.

01:21:30.280 --> 01:21:36.280
I want to see those Berkeley Systems games make a comeback, like Acrophobia and some of these other games used to be on Berkeley Systems.

01:21:36.280 --> 01:21:37.280
That's what this is.

01:21:37.280 --> 01:21:39.280
One vs. 100 is the Berkeley Systems games.

01:21:39.280 --> 01:21:41.280
That's exactly what it is.

01:21:41.280 --> 01:21:44.280
That's what I felt when I was playing it and everything.

01:21:44.280 --> 01:21:46.280
That's exactly what it is.

01:21:46.280 --> 01:21:48.280
Somebody at Microsoft is listening to this show or is thinking.

01:21:48.280 --> 01:21:50.280
Or we share the same genes.

01:21:50.280 --> 01:21:53.280
Because that is exactly what One vs. 100 is.

01:21:53.280 --> 01:21:55.280
But it's like that in the next generation.

01:21:55.280 --> 01:21:57.280
But see, that's the thing.

01:21:57.280 --> 01:22:03.280
Microsoft, they're really not going to have much to overcome because they've got something for everybody.

01:22:03.280 --> 01:22:12.280
They've got now these community games, One vs. 100 and stuff like that that's going to appeal to people that like watching game shows and stuff like that.

01:22:12.280 --> 01:22:17.280
Hey, do you think maybe they might try marketing that to elderly people that like watching game shows?

01:22:17.280 --> 01:22:19.280
Hey, now you can be on your favorite game show.

01:22:19.280 --> 01:22:22.280
Wheel of Fortune, oh my god, that's going to totally be one of you.

01:22:22.280 --> 01:22:25.280
It's not going to end with One vs. 100, by the way.

01:22:25.280 --> 01:22:26.280
Here's my prediction.

01:22:26.280 --> 01:22:28.280
I'm throwing this out here right now.

01:22:28.280 --> 01:22:34.280
You know how they've always talked about Xbox Gold is going to be going away in favor of some of these other perks?

01:22:34.280 --> 01:22:37.280
Because how can they otherwise compete with Sony?

01:22:37.280 --> 01:22:42.280
Sony makes a pretty damn good argument when they say you don't have to pay for our online gaming.

01:22:42.280 --> 01:22:47.280
Microsoft's going to make online gaming and Halo and shit free before you know it.

01:22:47.280 --> 01:22:49.280
And you know what it is?

01:22:49.280 --> 01:22:51.280
This is what you're going to be paying for.

01:22:51.280 --> 01:22:56.280
These gold games and these extra services and the live hosts and the prizes and all this stuff.

01:22:56.280 --> 01:23:03.280
Xbox has finally conned you into buying something like a membership to Pogo.com or one of those sites.

01:23:03.280 --> 01:23:07.280
You know, where you play the online games for cash and prizes and stuff.

01:23:07.280 --> 01:23:09.280
And that's just the first one that popped in my mind.

01:23:09.280 --> 01:23:11.280
But there's tons of these sites out there.

01:23:11.280 --> 01:23:13.280
That's what the Xbox is going to be.

01:23:13.280 --> 01:23:19.280
And they won't take half the shit that a lot of the people say when they talk about those other sites.

01:23:19.280 --> 01:23:21.280
Watch. Watch.

01:23:21.280 --> 01:23:24.280
That's what's going to happen with Xbox Live Gold.

01:23:24.280 --> 01:23:26.280
I don't know about that.

01:23:26.280 --> 01:23:31.280
That's a prediction, not a fact, but I could definitely see that happening.

01:23:31.280 --> 01:23:38.280
They've got a lot with their streaming and Netflix, the social networking stuff now.

01:23:38.280 --> 01:23:44.280
You have Xbox Live Arcade, the independent games now, the community games.

01:23:44.280 --> 01:23:48.280
Xbox Originals, you can download full games on there now.

01:23:48.280 --> 01:23:51.280
You can play your DVDs, all that stuff.

01:23:51.280 --> 01:23:54.280
So it's basically an entertainment console.

01:23:54.280 --> 01:23:58.280
Now you go to the Wii and you can play games on it.

01:23:58.280 --> 01:24:01.280
You can send a message to your friends.

01:24:01.280 --> 01:24:03.280
That's about it.

01:24:03.280 --> 01:24:05.280
I mean, it's really limited.

01:24:05.280 --> 01:24:11.280
I mean, you can play retro games and stuff like that, but it's really limited as far as the entertainment value.

01:24:11.280 --> 01:24:14.280
I mean, it's really just a gaming console.

01:24:14.280 --> 01:24:17.280
But, I mean, maybe this Wii HD will change all that.

01:24:17.280 --> 01:24:20.280
Maybe they will hopefully fix their online network.

01:24:20.280 --> 01:24:22.280
All right, I've got to read a couple more chats and then we've got to move on.

01:24:22.280 --> 01:24:26.280
Unfortunately, I think we're finding that when we allow ourselves to talk more about stories,

01:24:26.280 --> 01:24:28.280
we talk about them for like 20 minutes at a time.

01:24:28.280 --> 01:24:32.280
We're almost an hour and a half in and we've still got mail bags slated for this segment.

01:24:32.280 --> 01:24:34.280
But I do want to read a couple more comments.

01:24:34.280 --> 01:24:37.280
There's a great talk in chat.orangeonchurch.com tonight.

01:24:37.280 --> 01:24:42.280
sj100matt says, with the economy the way it is, some of us can't keep buying this updated shit.

01:24:42.280 --> 01:24:45.280
Granted, this recession isn't forever, for all we know.

01:24:45.280 --> 01:24:47.280
Yeah, wishful thinking. Let's hope you're right.

01:24:47.280 --> 01:24:51.280
But releasing the next new console isn't going to get the consumer to buy at this time.

01:24:51.280 --> 01:24:56.280
And then sj100matt continues in response to when I said the real war is coming.

01:24:56.280 --> 01:24:58.280
He says, well, fuck their war.

01:24:58.280 --> 01:25:01.280
I'm not going to fund it unless they make it worth my while.

01:25:01.280 --> 01:25:09.280
And that's a very good retort is that these things are only as good as the games that are on it,

01:25:09.280 --> 01:25:11.280
as we've always said.

01:25:11.280 --> 01:25:14.280
But something to think about, though, because you talk about the economy and all of that.

01:25:14.280 --> 01:25:18.280
Keep in mind, entertainment is one of the things that manages to persevere through the economy.

01:25:18.280 --> 01:25:21.280
You know, the movie industry, look at those movies that are out right now.

01:25:21.280 --> 01:25:24.280
Granted, there's been little dips in the movie industry,

01:25:24.280 --> 01:25:27.280
but not the major types of dips you would see in an economy like this,

01:25:27.280 --> 01:25:30.280
especially when ticket prices are still rising.

01:25:30.280 --> 01:25:33.280
Yeah, entertainment's not really hurting as bad.

01:25:33.280 --> 01:25:35.280
Although they claim that they are.

01:25:35.280 --> 01:25:38.280
A lot of people are willing to pay top dollar for entertainment.

01:25:38.280 --> 01:25:42.280
But not to devalue what he's saying, because I think the argument is still a valid one,

01:25:42.280 --> 01:25:47.280
is that, yeah, you still got to convince me that it's worth it to upgrade to a Wii HD.

01:25:47.280 --> 01:25:51.280
But Nintendo, the thing about Nintendo, you know what they've got in their back pocket?

01:25:51.280 --> 01:25:55.280
Mario, Zelda, Metroid, the characters you love.

01:25:55.280 --> 01:25:57.280
That's what they're holding in their back pocket.

01:25:57.280 --> 01:25:59.280
And people that will buy anything that says Nintendo on it.

01:25:59.280 --> 01:26:03.280
And all they have to do is show, hey, look, it's Link in HD.

01:26:03.280 --> 01:26:05.280
Boom! Instant fanboy boner in sales.

01:26:05.280 --> 01:26:09.280
And myself being one of them, I'm in line.

01:26:09.280 --> 01:26:12.280
I think a lot of us will be.

01:26:12.280 --> 01:26:13.280
Yeah.

01:26:13.280 --> 01:26:16.280
Let's face it, Nintendo taught us at age seven.

01:26:16.280 --> 01:26:20.280
You love Mario, and you love Link, and you love these games.

01:26:20.280 --> 01:26:22.280
And they will be with you forever.

01:26:22.280 --> 01:26:26.280
I'm loving Mario a lot less lately, though. I just have to say that.

01:26:26.280 --> 01:26:27.280
I don't know.

01:26:27.280 --> 01:26:30.280
Not buying that new Super Mario Brothers game, sorry.

01:26:30.280 --> 01:26:34.280
I'm not in it now because I don't have the friends to play with on the regular basis.

01:26:34.280 --> 01:26:37.280
I can't buy new Super Mario Brothers because I don't have enough friends.

01:26:37.280 --> 01:26:39.280
That's what it boils down to.

01:26:39.280 --> 01:26:42.280
So, yeah.

01:26:42.280 --> 01:26:44.280
Totally changed topic.

01:26:44.280 --> 01:26:54.280
EA, apparently, they've drawn some attention from, I guess, their prote-

01:26:54.280 --> 01:26:57.280
Not even really a real protest. It's a fake protest.

01:26:57.280 --> 01:27:00.280
At E3, they had protesters out front.

01:27:00.280 --> 01:27:01.280
Did you see it?

01:27:01.280 --> 01:27:03.280
Yeah, I saw it. I saw the protesters.

01:27:03.280 --> 01:27:04.280
Did you think it was real at first?

01:27:04.280 --> 01:27:06.280
Nope, not at all.

01:27:06.280 --> 01:27:10.280
I had a moment of hesitation because I was looking at it, and I was walking by,

01:27:10.280 --> 01:27:13.280
and I was thinking, you know, with the crazies in this state, I almost believe it.

01:27:13.280 --> 01:27:17.280
You know, as I was kind of walking by, I was like, oh, my God.

01:27:17.280 --> 01:27:19.280
This is kind of cool.

01:27:19.280 --> 01:27:21.280
Like, the crazies are out here protesting E3.

01:27:21.280 --> 01:27:22.280
This is awesome.

01:27:22.280 --> 01:27:25.280
But then as I was walking in the hall, and I started to post about it to the OLR Twitter,

01:27:25.280 --> 01:27:29.280
because you might remember at E3, I was letting the folks on Twitter control what I was looking at,

01:27:29.280 --> 01:27:30.280
and I started to tweet about it.

01:27:30.280 --> 01:27:33.280
And as I was doing it, I was thinking, you know what?

01:27:33.280 --> 01:27:36.280
They had, like, the EA logo on one of those boards, and some of these...

01:27:36.280 --> 01:27:39.280
These guys knew way too much about games.

01:27:39.280 --> 01:27:42.280
Oh, my... I just bought it, hook, line, and sinker.

01:27:42.280 --> 01:27:47.280
This protest was something that was staged for some game I haven't even been following.

01:27:47.280 --> 01:27:52.280
Yeah, and in fact, that wasn't the only person who bought that hook, line, and sinker.

01:27:52.280 --> 01:28:02.280
Apparently, the bloggers at LA Times, who basically wrote that the protesters promoted a multimedia anti-game website,

01:28:02.280 --> 01:28:11.280
the EA reps, of course, later confirmed to the Associated Press that the whole affair was staged by a marketing agency.

01:28:11.280 --> 01:28:18.280
It says now, apparently, game politics, they're pointing out that the stunt has angered many real Catholic bloggers.

01:28:18.280 --> 01:28:22.280
Margaret Cabaniss of Inside Catholic wrote,

01:28:22.280 --> 01:28:32.280
It's been clear for a while now that the entertainment industry views Christians on the whole as priggish, thin-skinned funkillers.

01:28:32.280 --> 01:28:37.280
Has anybody at EA actually read The Inferno?

01:28:37.280 --> 01:28:41.280
I'm sorry, but that's kind of funny.

01:28:41.280 --> 01:28:51.280
Another blogger, I guess, at Catholic Video Games wrote that gamers of all varieties will buy this product if it's, well, actually a good game.

01:28:51.280 --> 01:28:57.280
So instead of engaging in a shameless anti-Christian stunt to promote your poor excuse of a product,

01:28:57.280 --> 01:29:06.280
you might ought to work on making this game something better than a blatant God of War ripoff and make it something worthwhile.

01:29:06.280 --> 01:29:11.280
That second guy's actually got a good point, because yeah, it is a blatant God of War ripoff.

01:29:11.280 --> 01:29:16.280
But from the people I talked to that saw the game, it was behind closed doors, we weren't special enough to see it,

01:29:16.280 --> 01:29:19.280
but some of the people I talked to that saw it said, hey, it looks really good.

01:29:19.280 --> 01:29:24.280
Well, yeah, God of War is awesome. I mean, if a game blatantly rips it off, it's going to be fun, so I mean, why not?

01:29:24.280 --> 01:29:31.280
And yeah, I do have to laugh, because I do see Catholics, unfortunately, that way. Being a Catholic myself, I, yeah.

01:29:31.280 --> 01:29:37.280
And now I'm thinking back on the whole thing, and I'm kind of like, oh my gosh, I was so stupid to even believe it for like a minute,

01:29:37.280 --> 01:29:41.280
because one of those people, I swear to God, was dressed in the Puritan outfit.

01:29:41.280 --> 01:29:50.280
Like, the fucking Salem witch trials, like, out there, you know, in the fucking, like, churning the butter outfit. Burn the witch! Burn the witch!

01:29:50.280 --> 01:29:52.280
Well, you should know, we should...

01:29:52.280 --> 01:30:00.280
And I should, I, but, here's, here's what I ask you guys. Should you be mad that they did it, or should you be mad that people believed it?

01:30:00.280 --> 01:30:07.280
That it actually was happening for a minute? Because unfortunately, with some of these other things that sometimes you hear about the way,

01:30:07.280 --> 01:30:15.280
and I'm not talking about, you know, most people are pretty normal, but that, you know, unfortunately, there are 52% of the population in California

01:30:15.280 --> 01:30:21.280
that have bought into this whole thing that it's okay for, you know, religion to take away some of these rights and all this stuff,

01:30:21.280 --> 01:30:29.280
you know, because of all of this and all these other... There's many of us that believed for a minute it was true! Isn't that something to be concerned about?

01:30:29.280 --> 01:30:37.280
No. And, you know, at the same time, I think this whole, you know, stunt, it didn't really do anything other than draw attention to, obviously, the game,

01:30:37.280 --> 01:30:41.280
which is what they're hoping that it would, but it's not like the protest was,

01:30:41.280 --> 01:30:48.280
oh my god, there's so much full-frontal nudity in this game, it's unbelievable! And the violence and sex is just crazy!

01:30:48.280 --> 01:30:53.280
You know, then people would be like, oh, I gotta play this game, you know? Like, I would have been like, tell me more!

01:30:53.280 --> 01:31:04.280
But, no, it's just like, oh, there's the devil in this game. Really? Dante's Inferno, there's the devil in it, and evil, and oh my god, that's so unexpected.

01:31:04.280 --> 01:31:12.280
Well, when I walked by, I thought those people were protesting E3, and I was like, oh my gosh, and I could totally see the people out there.

01:31:12.280 --> 01:31:18.280
I mean, you know, there are these sick, sick people out there that, well, I shouldn't even mention it,

01:31:18.280 --> 01:31:23.280
because, you know, after what I just said, I wouldn't want to compare the two, because there's these obvious loons

01:31:23.280 --> 01:31:30.280
that go out there and protest these weddings, and not weddings, but funerals of people that have served for our country,

01:31:30.280 --> 01:31:35.280
and that they'll protest these funerals, I'm not even going to say who they are, because I don't want to give them attention,

01:31:35.280 --> 01:31:41.280
but they go out and protest these funerals of soldiers who died in the war, saying, this is because we have fags in America,

01:31:41.280 --> 01:31:50.280
that this soldier died and is burning in hell at this very moment. I mean, clearly crazed people out there doing it,

01:31:50.280 --> 01:31:55.280
and so I thought maybe E3 actually got a little bit of that, like, hey, Jack Thompson got his buddies together.

01:31:55.280 --> 01:32:00.280
You know, why did they even bother? They should have just tipped off the right people, you know, about that stuff,

01:32:00.280 --> 01:32:06.280
that they could have had actual, you know, protesters out there, but, do we have anyone that wants to comment on this?

01:32:06.280 --> 01:32:11.280
1-877-GAME-OLR. Did you think it was real? Did you buy into this for a minute? I want to know.

01:32:11.280 --> 01:32:13.280
Or are you Catholic and pissed off?

01:32:13.280 --> 01:32:20.280
Do you not remember when we did a protest, or we were kind of observing of a protest for booth babes back in 2006?

01:32:20.280 --> 01:32:22.280
And that was all just a play for...

01:32:22.280 --> 01:32:25.280
That was all hoax, too, and that got picked up by a lot of bloggers.

01:32:25.280 --> 01:32:28.280
But nobody went to the outpost, because wasn't that Scott's outpost?

01:32:28.280 --> 01:32:29.280
Yes, it was.

01:32:29.280 --> 01:32:30.280
And nobody went.

01:32:30.280 --> 01:32:33.280
Well, that part of the plan failed, but it still got picked up.

01:32:33.280 --> 01:32:37.280
I shouldn't say nobody. He had a decent crowd, but I think they were hoping for a little more, you know what I mean?

01:32:37.280 --> 01:32:44.280
Yes, part B of the plan, not exactly executed correctly, but the part A part did quite well.

01:32:44.280 --> 01:32:49.280
It got picked up on the blogs, because, hey, guess what, they're booth babes, or, you know, babes that are carrying signs,

01:32:49.280 --> 01:32:56.280
and, hey, it's a story and a pretty picture that go along with the story. Awesome.

01:32:56.280 --> 01:33:02.280
But, yeah, I think, I mean, the game itself, the whole protest thing seems unnecessary.

01:33:02.280 --> 01:33:08.280
But they should have had his devil's ring around. That'd be kind of cool. The signs.

01:33:08.280 --> 01:33:17.280
SSTA 100 Matt says, you know, Rob, not to get off topic, but the church's private organizations are running the same hate ads on the radio in New York for anti-gay marriage legislation.

01:33:17.280 --> 01:33:20.280
Let me respond to this in a minute, because we're getting a call.

01:33:20.280 --> 01:33:23.280
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?

01:33:23.280 --> 01:33:24.280
This is Leo Shen.

01:33:24.280 --> 01:33:31.280
Hey, Leo Shen, what's on your mind? This whole Dante's Inferno protesting. Is this offensive? Is it funny? Did you believe it?

01:33:31.280 --> 01:33:40.280
I actually found it hilarious, because I went to Fanime not too long ago, and there was actually protesters protesting Fanime.

01:33:40.280 --> 01:33:51.280
Really? Oh my gosh. Okay, I've been to Fanime. I've not seen the protesters. And it was the real deal? What were they saying? Cosplayers need to put down the cosplay and read the Bible?

01:33:51.280 --> 01:34:03.280
I'm not too sure, because I was looking at them from a distance, but I guess they were protesting against, like, you know, hentai and all that stuff against the anime porn.

01:34:03.280 --> 01:34:12.280
But the really funny thing was they had a cosplayer who came as Jesus to the anime convention, and he just went out there, and it was just hilarious.

01:34:12.280 --> 01:34:18.280
There's always somebody that's got to push the buttons. Did the protesters respond to the man in the Jesus cosplay?

01:34:18.280 --> 01:34:27.280
They just ignored him. And they had this other cosplayer who came out as Jesus, but as a raptor dinosaur.

01:34:27.280 --> 01:34:34.280
Wait, Jesus is a raptor dinosaur? How does that even work? Even I think I'm offended by that one.

01:34:34.280 --> 01:34:39.280
It's called 4chan. The fouls of the internet.

01:34:39.280 --> 01:34:46.280
The home of internet offensiveness. Alright, I understand. Well, thank you, Leo Shen, for the call. And thank you very much. I'm going to let you go.

01:34:46.280 --> 01:34:56.280
But, you know, just thinking about the whole, you know, again, protesters were at Fanime. Why can't they be at E3?

01:34:56.280 --> 01:35:04.280
Anyway, I wanted to respond to this real quick, because, yes, it is a little off topic, but I need to say something, because obviously, you know, being gay myself, I have a whole lot to say on this.

01:35:04.280 --> 01:35:14.280
SJ100Matt says, you know, Rob, not to get off topic, but the same churches, private organizations are running the same hate ads on the radio in New York for anti-gay marriage legislation.

01:35:14.280 --> 01:35:25.280
So, again, this just goes back to the whole, that's why I believed it when you had the chick in the Puritan outfit there with the sign that says, you know, Dante's Inferno, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

01:35:25.280 --> 01:35:36.280
Because when I see these ads and I hear these hate speech and stuff like that on the radio about, you know, withholding people's rights, when it's in the goddamn Constitution on the 14th Amendment,

01:35:36.280 --> 01:35:44.280
no state shall pass a law that robs people of the pursuit to life, liberty, et cetera, et cetera.

01:35:44.280 --> 01:35:54.280
Okay? Like, when I see these ads, that's what I hear in my head. Burn the witch! Burn them! Throw them in the river, see if they float! Don't give them any rights!

01:35:54.280 --> 01:35:58.280
It's the archaic way of thinking. It's always something.

01:35:58.280 --> 01:36:06.280
Sorry if I'm getting a little too personal and political for you, but deal. You know, this is, you know, my rights that are being affected here.

01:36:06.280 --> 01:36:10.280
When have I ever shut up about that topic on the show?

01:36:10.280 --> 01:36:13.280
All right, anything else to say about the protest, Loki?

01:36:13.280 --> 01:36:16.280
Uh, no, it was retarded looking.

01:36:16.280 --> 01:36:23.280
I mean, the whole thing was a little silly, but I will admit, I believed it for like half a second. I really did.

01:36:23.280 --> 01:36:29.280
All right. Usually at the end of Part A, we would do the Classic Game of the Week, but unfortunately, Dark Sakura is not here.

01:36:29.280 --> 01:36:34.280
She will be here. We're anticipating during the next part of the show, so in the meantime, we need to get into the mailbag.

01:36:34.280 --> 01:36:38.280
We're going to switch out mailbag and do it during Part A tonight, so let's open up the mail.

01:36:38.280 --> 01:36:48.280
Mailbag at Orangelaungerator.com if you want to send us an email. That's the place to go, and we're always curious about your thoughts.

01:36:48.280 --> 01:36:55.280
GeneralGurdover sent us an email wanting us to check out their podcast.

01:36:55.280 --> 01:37:00.280
Well, I haven't checked it out yet. Sadly, I'm behind on the email, but nun2k.com.

01:37:00.280 --> 01:37:05.280
I'm always one to support independent podcasters. I hope that wasn't a porn ad or something in disguise.

01:37:05.280 --> 01:37:09.280
Will somebody please check that website out and let me make sure it is a legitimate indie podcast for me?

01:37:09.280 --> 01:37:18.280
I want to read this email. This email comes to us from... I don't want to read the real name there.

01:37:18.280 --> 01:37:24.280
I don't think there is a real name. I will say the email says Nutman, so we'll call this person Nutman.

01:37:24.280 --> 01:37:29.280
Loki, can you please not yell so much?

01:37:29.280 --> 01:37:30.280
No, I can't.

01:37:30.280 --> 01:37:38.280
I had to turn down the volume almost ten times in episode 326 because Loki was yelling so loudly, it was hurting my ears.

01:37:38.280 --> 01:37:40.280
You can't be alone in this, right?

01:37:40.280 --> 01:37:43.280
P.S. O.L.R. is awesome, as is Loki.

01:37:43.280 --> 01:37:45.280
I guess you just need to turn it down a little bit, Loki.

01:37:45.280 --> 01:37:50.280
This could be a problem that we've moved studios. We unhook and hook up the mics every week.

01:37:50.280 --> 01:37:55.280
We do rely on the live listeners to tell us if things sound way too crazy.

01:37:55.280 --> 01:37:58.280
Live listeners, if we are too loud, let us know, please.

01:37:58.280 --> 01:38:04.280
We'd be happy to turn down the volume a little bit so you guys don't have to suffer so much.

01:38:04.280 --> 01:38:10.280
Loki's yelled for seven years. That's his thing on the show, if you haven't figured that out by now.

01:38:10.280 --> 01:38:14.280
That's not yelling. I don't know what you're talking about.

01:38:14.280 --> 01:38:19.280
Well, I'm not talking about yelling like you might yell at somebody you're mad at, but I'm talking about you do have angry white man voice.

01:38:19.280 --> 01:38:26.280
That's just your last name, angry white man voice.

01:38:26.280 --> 01:38:30.280
He has angry white man voice, that's right.

01:38:30.280 --> 01:38:34.280
But, yeah, we'll try to make sure it doesn't get out of control.

01:38:34.280 --> 01:38:39.280
So, chatters, please feel free to speak up if Loki is getting too loud.

01:38:39.280 --> 01:38:42.280
Let's see, we got a lot of emails this week.

01:38:42.280 --> 01:38:46.280
This comes to us from J-Rod.

01:38:46.280 --> 01:38:50.280
Hey, O.L.R. folks, I'm writing in a comment on Left 4 Dead 2 boycott.

01:38:50.280 --> 01:38:56.280
I want to stand on the other side of the fence from all the opinions in the O.L.R. studio just for argument's sake.

01:38:56.280 --> 01:39:00.280
I'm not one of the people who are butthurt about this, but I can understand why people are pissed.

01:39:00.280 --> 01:39:04.280
I agree that the game is coming out way too soon since the first one was just released in November.

01:39:04.280 --> 01:39:13.280
The reason people are pissed isn't because they are spoiled, it's because they expect more from Valve with integrity compared to, say, Activision in regards to putting out sequels for a cash grab.

01:39:13.280 --> 01:39:23.280
The reason people support Valve by buying up their games and having such consumer loyalty is because Valve always takes care of their customers with free updates, content, and product support.

01:39:23.280 --> 01:39:38.280
Personally, I think they could have put all this content into the first game with a huge update, but this sequel reeks of Microsoft holding a leash because they won't allow free stuff on Xbox Live, the same way they forced Epic to charge for map packs in Gears of War 2 that Epic intended to be free.

01:39:38.280 --> 01:39:50.280
To address Loki's statement on huge E3 lines for the game and how everyone is going to buy it, that's fine and dandy, but I don't expect to hear any whining when everyone buys piles upon piles of the newest Guitar Hero and Wii Fit sports games.

01:39:50.280 --> 01:39:53.280
Which is funny because we just whined about that earlier in the show.

01:39:53.280 --> 01:40:03.280
Also, one more shorter point. Everyone at the OLR Studio seems to be taking a crap on Sony for their lack of content for this year. Have you all completely missed Sony's biggest release of the year, Infamous?

01:40:03.280 --> 01:40:10.280
I'm actually surprised to hear nobody on the show talking about it because it's a very big PS3 exclusive release put out by Sucker Punch.

01:40:10.280 --> 01:40:18.280
PS, $250 for a PSP. Apparently cocaine is a hell of a drug. This email is sponsored by the Olive Garden Home of the Never Ending Salad and Breadsticks.

01:40:18.280 --> 01:40:24.280
Yeah, I heard about Infamous. I'm well aware of it being out and unfortunately, though, I'm playing Prototype, which is almost...

01:40:24.280 --> 01:40:28.280
I mean, it's not identical, but I mean, it's the same type of gameplay right now.

01:40:28.280 --> 01:40:36.280
And I think you didn't hear us say anything about it because the game, like, came out. So there wasn't really a lot of, like, hubub about it at E3. It was, you know, more of...

01:40:36.280 --> 01:40:37.280
They had it there.

01:40:37.280 --> 01:40:43.280
I think they had it there, but it was just, you know, people weren't really paying attention to that because they're like, hey, this is out next week. Let's look at, you know, all this other stuff.

01:40:43.280 --> 01:40:49.280
And then it seemed like, I think, part of the point you were trying to make last week is that it seemed like there was this huge gap in the rest of 2009.

01:40:49.280 --> 01:40:56.280
And then we've got all this stuff that's supposed to come out in 2010. Although it does seem like, you know, we'll be peppered with a few nice things here and there.

01:40:56.280 --> 01:41:05.280
Yeah, I mean, Infamous looks good. I'm planning on picking up maybe later on, but like I mentioned earlier, I have, like, two PlayStation 3 games, though, that have come out back in.

01:41:05.280 --> 01:41:14.280
One in November, one in, you know, the end of February that I'm still waiting to play. And I've just... I'm catching up.

01:41:14.280 --> 01:41:18.280
Let's talk, though, about the other end of the more meatier part of the email about Left 4 Dead 2.

01:41:18.280 --> 01:41:24.280
Because we did go off on quite a tangent about this game last week and, you know, talk about, you know, that people should stop whining so much.

01:41:24.280 --> 01:41:35.280
But does he make a point that, you know, Microsoft wanted this other company to charge for their map packs? You know, is this Microsoft's influence? That it's a cash grab?

01:41:35.280 --> 01:41:36.280
No.

01:41:36.280 --> 01:41:41.280
I have to admit, although I respect the points brought up in this email, my opinion has not changed.

01:41:41.280 --> 01:41:42.280
I don't think it's Microsoft's fault.

01:41:42.280 --> 01:41:44.280
And I don't think it can change until the game comes out.

01:41:44.280 --> 01:42:01.280
I think it's EA's fault. Because EA would be the publisher. And at the same time, though, they're saying, oh, well, we've made enhancements to the AI, to the director, and there's stuff that we couldn't have done in Left 4 Dead 1 and stuff.

01:42:01.280 --> 01:42:06.280
And really, in the end, it's the developer deciding to do it or not.

01:42:06.280 --> 01:42:21.280
I mean, because they don't have to. And we're talking download content, you know, they could put out those enhancements, you know, the map packs and stuff like that for Left 4 Dead or, you know, other stuff, maybe Team Fortress 2 and stuff, maybe add, you know, sell it.

01:42:21.280 --> 01:42:32.280
They could put that stuff out. But, you know, if it's, you know, the fact that it's being, you know, that they won't let them put it out for free, well, that's still an excuse because they can always put it out for as cheap as possible, you know.

01:42:32.280 --> 01:42:44.280
Here's my biggest thing. This is why I don't get it yet, and why I'm not on board with you guys yet, because the game isn't out. And there's still a long way to go before the holiday, and we don't really know the full potential of this game just yet.

01:42:44.280 --> 01:42:54.280
Granted, we got a lot of details out of E3 and so forth. Here's why I don't like these Guitar Hero games upon game. They feel like cheap re-skinning of the previous game.

01:42:54.280 --> 01:43:05.280
But you'll notice we haven't said any of that about Beatles Rock Band. We've lavished praise upon praise upon where this game's going, because it does feel like a completely unique, justifiably separately purchased game.

01:43:05.280 --> 01:43:13.280
And if Left 4 Dead 2 ultimately is that at the end, I don't think you guys, you know, whether this could have been an update or not, have much to stand on.

01:43:13.280 --> 01:43:24.280
However, if the game is a cheap re-skinning of Left 4 Dead 1 with just four new characters and new maps and all the same enemies as before and all that, then I am right there with you. I will sign the goddamn petition myself.

01:43:24.280 --> 01:43:35.280
But I don't think we can really say until the game is out. And Valve, as a developer, does not seem like the type of company that would do that, but I don't know. It could be wishful thinking.

01:43:35.280 --> 01:43:45.280
At the same time, like I mentioned before, don't you guys think you might be a little bit spoiled by them? I mean, I think their support of the community and everything has been huge.

01:43:45.280 --> 01:43:55.280
I mean, look at what they're doing with Team Fortress 2. It's just like updates upon updates for this game that came out, you know, a while ago and still, you know, huge support for it.

01:43:55.280 --> 01:44:08.280
And I think at the same time, you don't realize that, you know, yeah, they're putting a lot of support behind this, but at the same time, they need to make some money too. And yeah, that's not an excuse, I guess, in the gamer's eyes to put out another game.

01:44:08.280 --> 01:44:16.280
But at the same time, maybe there's something that really they can't do where they felt, okay, this is different enough that it justifies its own release.

01:44:16.280 --> 01:44:29.280
I don't know. I mean, you can't just have everything be exactly the same all the time. Things have to change, so I guess, you know, if you don't like it, don't buy it.

01:44:29.280 --> 01:44:38.280
And then, you know what, if the sales suck on it, then they'll learn, okay, maybe we can't do this. If that's really, you know, a money grab.

01:44:38.280 --> 01:44:48.280
Yeah, we have some comments on chat and, you know, again, it seems to be that most people are saying, Act F says, bah, cry more. That's my opinion on the Left 4 Dead 2 boycott.

01:44:48.280 --> 01:44:54.280
GameGuru says, I'm willing to give Left 4 Dead 2 the benefit of the doubt because it means Left 4 Dead 1 will be cheaper.

01:44:54.280 --> 01:45:07.280
There you go. I don't know, I guess we'll see a little more when this game actually is released. I think that's when I have to reserve my ultimate judgment for is when the game's released.

01:45:07.280 --> 01:45:17.280
If it stinks then, then I'll be right there in line with you guys and if they try to push out Left 4 Dead 3 in 2010, if Left 4 Dead 2 stinks, I will openly mock it here on this program.

01:45:17.280 --> 01:45:24.280
I mean, and just, you know, I wouldn't exactly blame Microsoft for, I mean, look at the company that's, you know, helping to publish these games.

01:45:24.280 --> 01:45:32.280
They're known for putting out numerous sports games each year numerically. I mean, come on.

01:45:32.280 --> 01:45:42.280
I want to read this email real quick and this comes to us from our old buddy Rini. I'm not going to read the whole thing because it's very, very lengthy, but I do want to read bits and pieces of it and give this game a little shout out here.

01:45:42.280 --> 01:45:49.280
Greetings, OLR peoples. Rini here and I just got into the free limited beta for Ion online that happened for the weekend of June 7th.

01:45:49.280 --> 01:45:56.280
I'm trying the game out because Warcraft has become the doldrums and also because it's become my best friend's next fangasm until Final Fantasy XIV.

01:45:56.280 --> 01:46:01.280
For the bulk of this lengthy email, I'm going to describe some features from the game that I've witnessed in comparison to WoW.

01:46:01.280 --> 01:46:08.280
It talks about the plot being two rival races. It talks about that it's got the character customization of Elder Scrolls Oblivion.

01:46:08.280 --> 01:46:14.280
There's a mage, priest, scouts, and warriors. At level 9, a quest is automatically given to you to get your wings.

01:46:14.280 --> 01:46:18.280
It's basically a free ride to level 10 that you should get to all the different capital cities.

01:46:18.280 --> 01:46:26.280
The flight time is initially limited, but you can extend it. There's loading time when you start the game, but once you get in there, it's very short, around 10 seconds or so.

01:46:26.280 --> 01:46:31.280
The game is very pretty in a Final Fantasy sort of way. The battles are brisk and so forth.

01:46:31.280 --> 01:46:37.280
I'm trying to read through all this. It talks about missions and holding things in a cube and what have you.

01:46:37.280 --> 01:46:44.280
Something WoW neglects. If you're in a high traffic area and it's really bogging your system down, it's no problem.

01:46:44.280 --> 01:46:49.280
Press a keyboard combination and all other player models will disappear.

01:46:49.280 --> 01:46:56.280
I didn't get to try out stuff like parties, alliances, emotes, etc. There's a lot of interface elements that would need a plugin for WoW to show up.

01:46:56.280 --> 01:47:02.280
For example, a quest tracker or a level gauge for quests. For some reason, there's a quest to steal a bathing nymph's clothes too.

01:47:02.280 --> 01:47:07.280
I've taken screenshots of what I've seen around the game, with the game running almost everything at max settings.

01:47:07.280 --> 01:47:13.280
No anti-aliasing, decree, shadow, and water effects. Please skim through it and post to chat if you would like.

01:47:13.280 --> 01:47:19.280
Hopefully Ion will not disappoint. I'm buying the limited edition and getting suckered into playing it anyway because I want to play with my best friend.

01:47:19.280 --> 01:47:24.280
My expectations are low because WoW's PVP just left me insulted with how slow and unfair it was.

01:47:24.280 --> 01:47:28.280
Maybe Ion will be a little closer to something resembling PSO.

01:47:28.280 --> 01:47:34.280
Lastly, I'd like to apologize, especially to Sky, for bringing up hopes for Omega Man Legends 3 for E3. Sorry!

01:47:34.280 --> 01:47:39.280
This email is brought to you by Benafiber. Everyone needs their damn fiber. Fuck yeah, bowel movements.

01:47:39.280 --> 01:47:46.280
I have a question, and this is kind of E3 related, but the whole Mega Man Legends thing.

01:47:46.280 --> 01:47:50.280
I remember Capcom said they had two secret games that they hadn't announced yet.

01:47:50.280 --> 01:47:56.280
One of those got leaked, and that was Tatsunoko vs Capcom All-Stars or whatever it was.

01:47:56.280 --> 01:47:57.280
What the hell was the second one?

01:47:57.280 --> 01:48:00.280
Well, hold on, because we've got a call, and I bet this caller might know.

01:48:00.280 --> 01:48:02.280
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this?

01:48:02.280 --> 01:48:03.280
Hey, what's up guys? It's the Rob D.

01:48:03.280 --> 01:48:07.280
Rob, we had you on hold while Loki was saying that. Do you know what that second game is?

01:48:07.280 --> 01:48:11.280
I think it was a Resident Evil title for the PSP. I think that's what it was.

01:48:11.280 --> 01:48:16.280
I remember hearing that being announced, and I asked a couple people about it, and I think that's what it was.

01:48:16.280 --> 01:48:21.280
That makes sense. Well, Rob, we have the Skyplines open all night tonight, so I know you're calling in to respond to something in the mailbag.

01:48:21.280 --> 01:48:26.280
In fact, you said on chat something about this whole Left 4 Dead 2 boycott. What are your thoughts on it?

01:48:26.280 --> 01:48:29.280
Well, here's the thing. I've seen a lot of different complaints.

01:48:29.280 --> 01:48:35.280
Obviously, people love to complain about everything on forums and on podcasts and everything when it relates to the video game industry,

01:48:35.280 --> 01:48:37.280
because people are passionate about it. It's their interest.

01:48:37.280 --> 01:48:44.280
And I've seen people defend a lot of stupid things. I've seen people defend us getting nickeled and dimed for horse armor.

01:48:44.280 --> 01:48:49.280
And you know what? That even brings up a lot of strong opinions even today.

01:48:49.280 --> 01:48:55.280
But this is the first time that I've ever seen people do something, gamers in particular, that I just cannot defend at all.

01:48:55.280 --> 01:49:02.280
Because, I mean, really, remember when we got expansion packs back in the late 90s and people got pissed off at that

01:49:02.280 --> 01:49:09.280
because it was just a couple new enemies, more levels, and they weren't even really that good for games like Sin and whatever else.

01:49:09.280 --> 01:49:13.280
We flipped upside down. Now we don't want sequels.

01:49:13.280 --> 01:49:19.280
We don't want these companies to actually give us new engines and give us new sets of things to do.

01:49:19.280 --> 01:49:22.280
We want expansion packs. What has changed now?

01:49:22.280 --> 01:49:27.280
I would give one of my good kidneys to get a sequel, certainly before this year, for Street Fighter,

01:49:27.280 --> 01:49:31.280
and now for a true sequel to Chrono Trigger or Marvel vs. Capcom 3.

01:49:31.280 --> 01:49:37.280
Why are people upset that they're getting a sequel to a game they love? I don't get this.

01:49:37.280 --> 01:49:42.280
Well, I think they feel that this sequel is an expansion pack. That's what it is.

01:49:42.280 --> 01:49:45.280
No, they want it as an expansion pack with DLC. They don't want an actual sequel.

01:49:45.280 --> 01:49:48.280
They don't want Valve to actually put the effort in.

01:49:48.280 --> 01:49:57.280
I understand they want more support for Left 4 Dead, but why don't they want an actual game with new features and hopefully a better game?

01:49:57.280 --> 01:49:59.280
Progress is good.

01:49:59.280 --> 01:50:04.280
Well, I think the argument, and again, I don't really know the other side as well.

01:50:04.280 --> 01:50:10.280
Maybe we'll get emails on it next week, but I think the argument is they feel like, because this is being put together so quickly,

01:50:10.280 --> 01:50:16.280
because the early screenshots and gameplay indicate it's basically Left 4 Dead 1 with new characters enduring the day and a new setting,

01:50:16.280 --> 01:50:23.280
that this is basically a guitar hero Van Halen of Left 4 Dead.

01:50:23.280 --> 01:50:27.280
But we're making our judgments on a handful of trailers and a few screenshots.

01:50:27.280 --> 01:50:31.280
And you hinted at this earlier, that this is Valve. This is not a company.

01:50:31.280 --> 01:50:36.280
Admittedly, I think it is published by EA, right? Or maybe you're talking about Rockband.

01:50:36.280 --> 01:50:39.280
No, this is published by EA.

01:50:39.280 --> 01:50:45.280
Yeah. I understand that since it is published by EA, that is some cause for concern.

01:50:45.280 --> 01:50:50.280
But you know what? This isn't a company that has done this in the past that is developing this game.

01:50:50.280 --> 01:50:53.280
We should give them a little bit of trust.

01:50:53.280 --> 01:50:58.280
Deep Man and Chat says they think it will break up the community, it will split them between the two games.

01:50:58.280 --> 01:51:01.280
I don't know if I necessarily see that so much.

01:51:01.280 --> 01:51:05.280
About Call of Duty, we'll look at Call of Duty World at War and Call of Duty Modern Warfare.

01:51:05.280 --> 01:51:08.280
The games that that happens to are the sports games.

01:51:08.280 --> 01:51:14.280
That's the one where you go into EA 2010, you know, whatever, and then 2009 is abandoned.

01:51:14.280 --> 01:51:20.280
But most games you still find, you know, pretty, like case in point, EverQuest 1 and EverQuest 2.

01:51:20.280 --> 01:51:25.280
Granted, completely different type of game because people invest a lot more time into those types of games.

01:51:25.280 --> 01:51:29.280
But EverQuest 1 still has probably more of a community than EverQuest 2.

01:51:31.280 --> 01:51:34.280
Any other thoughts, Rob? Before we let you go and wrap up part A here.

01:51:34.280 --> 01:51:40.280
Not really. This whole issue just ticks me off so much because, again, there are so many games that I can think of.

01:51:40.280 --> 01:51:44.280
I don't want to bash it, but there are so many games that I enjoy more that I would want sequels to.

01:51:44.280 --> 01:51:48.280
And these people are complaining because they are getting a sequel to it and good timing too.

01:51:48.280 --> 01:51:50.280
Well, let's just hope that the sequel is not cheap.

01:51:50.280 --> 01:51:55.280
Let's hope that what you and I are thinking is the case and that this game will be pretty awesome with a lot of new features.

01:51:55.280 --> 01:51:58.280
Or else, I don't know, they may have a point.

01:51:58.280 --> 01:52:01.280
I think they'll eat crow. But anyway, see you guys later.

01:52:01.280 --> 01:52:02.280
Alright, take care, Rob.

01:52:02.280 --> 01:52:07.280
Yeah, I don't know. I think, I don't know. I don't know. I can't tell until I play the game.

01:52:07.280 --> 01:52:08.280
That's really where it's at.

01:52:08.280 --> 01:52:10.280
Alright, dang, we are really long.

01:52:10.280 --> 01:52:12.280
And sorry I didn't get to all the emails tonight.

01:52:12.280 --> 01:52:15.280
I didn't get the emails from some folks that actually called us anyway or some folks put,

01:52:15.280 --> 01:52:18.280
you don't have to read this on air, so I didn't because we had a lot of emails tonight.

01:52:18.280 --> 01:52:21.280
But if you want to send us an email for a future week, please do.

01:52:21.280 --> 01:52:23.280
Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

01:52:23.280 --> 01:52:25.280
We are going to finally take a break here.

01:52:25.280 --> 01:52:28.280
You know we've been on air for an hour and fifty minutes so far.

01:52:28.280 --> 01:52:29.280
We're going to take a break.

01:52:29.280 --> 01:52:32.280
Dark Soccer is on her way home, so it sounds like she'll be joining us for Part B tonight.

01:52:32.280 --> 01:52:37.280
We'll be right back in about five to ten minutes with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

01:52:37.280 --> 01:52:40.280
For those of you guys listening on the podcast, though, you only have to wait like five seconds.

01:52:40.280 --> 01:52:41.280
Aren't you lucky?

01:52:41.280 --> 01:52:49.280
We'll be right back with plenty more stories here on Orange Lounge Radio.

01:52:49.280 --> 01:52:54.280
Welcome back, everybody, to Part B of tonight's episode, number 327,

01:52:54.280 --> 01:52:58.280
taping live on AllGames.com on this lovely Sunday night.

01:52:58.280 --> 01:53:04.280
We are here, Orange Lounge Radio, myself, Loki, and making her way back into the studio.

01:53:04.280 --> 01:53:07.280
Dark Soccer is here joining us for Part B tonight.

01:53:07.280 --> 01:53:11.280
Hi, I'm just, I will be officially joining probably in about another ten, fifteen minutes.

01:53:11.280 --> 01:53:13.280
You had a PE class or something tonight, right?

01:53:13.280 --> 01:53:19.280
Yeah, I did. I'm taking, well, it's walking slash jogging slash running slash cardio slash whatever

01:53:19.280 --> 01:53:21.280
we want to do as long as it gets the heart rate up for twenty minutes.

01:53:21.280 --> 01:53:22.280
That's the class.

01:53:22.280 --> 01:53:25.280
And it's mostly online, so it's on our system, you know, pretty much.

01:53:25.280 --> 01:53:33.280
But the test our teacher has us do now and the fact that she watches us walk our mile,

01:53:33.280 --> 01:53:38.280
I don't think, unless someone really can fake it well, I don't think anyone's going to be able to, so.

01:53:38.280 --> 01:53:39.280
Interesting.

01:53:39.280 --> 01:53:43.280
Yeah, and apparently this is her third one and she's had a lot of success with it, so I'm pretty happy.

01:53:43.280 --> 01:53:46.280
All right, well, that's all right. Loki and I are going to continue to juggle the stories,

01:53:46.280 --> 01:53:50.280
but please chime in as I know I told you before the show about something new,

01:53:50.280 --> 01:53:52.280
the new experiment we were trying tonight.

01:53:52.280 --> 01:53:56.280
We almost went two hours with Part A, six stories, but lots of opinions out there.

01:53:56.280 --> 01:54:01.280
Well, you know, I actually, I kind of, I was thinking about it actually when I was doing my very painful

01:54:01.280 --> 01:54:03.280
because of my shoes walk.

01:54:03.280 --> 01:54:07.280
No, I got new walking shoes and I need insoles for them because it makes my arch hurt.

01:54:07.280 --> 01:54:13.280
But anyway, enough fitness talk, which I actually want to get back into playing DDR

01:54:13.280 --> 01:54:17.280
because I walked a thirteen minute mile when I was playing DDR once a week.

01:54:17.280 --> 01:54:18.280
I'm on DDR.

01:54:18.280 --> 01:54:22.280
I went to Roseville Golf Land this week, the place where video games go to die.

01:54:22.280 --> 01:54:25.280
I played that lovely, lovely BeatMania 2DX distorted machine they had.

01:54:25.280 --> 01:54:27.280
Player one black keys are sticking already.

01:54:27.280 --> 01:54:28.280
Gotta love it.

01:54:28.280 --> 01:54:30.280
Right side pride.

01:54:30.280 --> 01:54:31.280
Whatever.

01:54:31.280 --> 01:54:33.280
Haha, I don't have to deal with that.

01:54:33.280 --> 01:54:34.280
Die in a right side fire.

01:54:34.280 --> 01:54:35.280
Burn.

01:54:35.280 --> 01:54:40.280
Well, now that I'm not upstairs anymore in my apartment, my DDR hard pads,

01:54:40.280 --> 01:54:44.280
as soon as I figure out how to ground them from the static electricity buildup.

01:54:44.280 --> 01:54:49.280
Let's not revive the DDR discussion from last week because I'll just get really sad.

01:54:49.280 --> 01:54:51.280
The whole thing.

01:54:51.280 --> 01:54:53.280
My pads actually started falling apart.

01:54:53.280 --> 01:54:55.280
Now you're going to have to mod them for eight arrows.

01:54:55.280 --> 01:54:56.280
Remember, that's what we're getting in the PlayStation.

01:54:56.280 --> 01:54:58.280
No, I'm sorry, that's not real DDR.

01:54:58.280 --> 01:55:00.280
Don't buy this Konami bullshit.

01:55:00.280 --> 01:55:01.280
No, we can't think of anything.

01:55:01.280 --> 01:55:02.280
Let's add more arrows.

01:55:02.280 --> 01:55:03.280
I'm more curious.

01:55:03.280 --> 01:55:04.280
Wait, hold on about DDR.

01:55:04.280 --> 01:55:06.280
I'm more curious what Jamie was thinking on her walk

01:55:06.280 --> 01:55:08.280
because it was about the show and the whole thing.

01:55:08.280 --> 01:55:11.280
Well, no, I was just thinking about what it was going to be like,

01:55:11.280 --> 01:55:16.280
and it actually was going to be more like when Larry King has people call in,

01:55:16.280 --> 01:55:18.280
except we're cooler and he's old.

01:55:18.280 --> 01:55:22.280
Well, you know, and I think a lot of the feedback I've kind of heard

01:55:22.280 --> 01:55:24.280
over the couple years we've been doing this, you know,

01:55:24.280 --> 01:55:26.280
because it seems like every year or two years we try something new with the format.

01:55:26.280 --> 01:55:30.280
So we've been doing, what, this whole combined A and B for about, what, a year and a half or so?

01:55:30.280 --> 01:55:34.280
I think one of the feedback I get is, you know, we already kind of hear about the news.

01:55:34.280 --> 01:55:37.280
I tune in to hear you guys, you know, talk about it, make jokes and so forth,

01:55:37.280 --> 01:55:42.280
and the fact that, you know, not a lot of shows are as interactive as you guys.

01:55:42.280 --> 01:55:45.280
I mean, granted, there's lots of shows that are trying to get interactive, you know,

01:55:45.280 --> 01:55:47.280
but they're kind of few and far between.

01:55:47.280 --> 01:55:49.280
We started off that way, really.

01:55:49.280 --> 01:55:51.280
Yeah, I mean, well, that's always what our show's been about.

01:55:51.280 --> 01:55:53.280
We either had the studio full of people or...

01:55:53.280 --> 01:55:57.280
But instead of just running through the news and then let everybody call in on this,

01:55:57.280 --> 01:56:00.280
you know, hodgepock clusterfuck of calls at the end, why not, you know,

01:56:00.280 --> 01:56:02.280
since this is the show where every gamer has a voice,

01:56:02.280 --> 01:56:05.280
spend a little more time on each story and let everybody voice their opinions.

01:56:05.280 --> 01:56:08.280
Giving that same, that, you know, aforementioned voice.

01:56:08.280 --> 01:56:11.280
Yes, and tell the dick and fart joke that goes along with that story.

01:56:11.280 --> 01:56:12.280
Hey, Rob.

01:56:12.280 --> 01:56:13.280
What?

01:56:13.280 --> 01:56:14.280
A dick went fart.

01:56:14.280 --> 01:56:15.280
Ha ha.

01:56:15.280 --> 01:56:17.280
I'm laughing.

01:56:17.280 --> 01:56:18.280
Okay.

01:56:18.280 --> 01:56:22.280
I am going to go freshen up.

01:56:22.280 --> 01:56:23.280
All right.

01:56:23.280 --> 01:56:24.280
Let's see.

01:56:24.280 --> 01:56:25.280
Let's move.

01:56:25.280 --> 01:56:26.280
All right.

01:56:26.280 --> 01:56:28.280
Let's get back into some of that gaming news that we're going to spend a little more time on tonight.

01:56:28.280 --> 01:56:31.280
Of course, you can call us at any time, 1-877-GAME-OLR.

01:56:31.280 --> 01:56:33.280
If we don't get to the story you wanted to talk about tonight, though,

01:56:33.280 --> 01:56:36.280
we will open up the Skype line at the end of the show for open bar.

01:56:36.280 --> 01:56:41.280
Loki, you're going to start us off this half with another story.

01:56:41.280 --> 01:56:42.280
Yes, I am.

01:56:42.280 --> 01:56:50.280
So apparently the PS3 motion controller that they showed off at, you know, E3.

01:56:50.280 --> 01:56:52.280
You know what, that always happens.

01:56:52.280 --> 01:56:53.280
Play happy music.

01:56:53.280 --> 01:56:54.280
Damn it.

01:56:54.280 --> 01:56:55.280
Sorry.

01:56:55.280 --> 01:56:58.280
Maybe someday I'll learn how to fix my audio cues.

01:56:58.280 --> 01:56:59.280
Sorry.

01:56:59.280 --> 01:57:00.280
Yes, PlayStation 3.

01:57:00.280 --> 01:57:01.280
Yes.

01:57:01.280 --> 01:57:06.280
So the new motion controller that they showed off during their E3 press conference,

01:57:06.280 --> 01:57:11.280
it's apparently going to be compatible with existing games,

01:57:11.280 --> 01:57:17.280
which it makes sense because you can patch games and why not?

01:57:17.280 --> 01:57:25.280
I'm not sure if it's exactly going to work the way, say, you think, I don't know,

01:57:25.280 --> 01:57:27.280
a controller, like it wouldn't be mapped.

01:57:27.280 --> 01:57:33.280
Like if, you know, I move my arm down, it's not going to move the analog stick left down or something like that.

01:57:33.280 --> 01:57:35.280
You know, I don't think it's going to be like that.

01:57:35.280 --> 01:57:38.280
But they may be able to patch it in to other games,

01:57:38.280 --> 01:57:41.280
which makes sense because they patched in DualShock 3 support.

01:57:41.280 --> 01:57:42.280
Why not?

01:57:42.280 --> 01:57:44.280
And you know what, I support that.

01:57:44.280 --> 01:57:46.280
I mean, that would be kind of cool.

01:57:46.280 --> 01:57:52.280
You know, some of your older games get new life later on with this controller if you happen to buy it.

01:57:52.280 --> 01:57:55.280
But here's my thing and the reason why I want to talk about this a little bit.

01:57:55.280 --> 01:57:59.280
Do we really need motion control to be shoved down our throat in every game?

01:57:59.280 --> 01:58:02.280
It doesn't have to be, but it's an option.

01:58:02.280 --> 01:58:08.280
It's a good way, say, you put up the motion controller and there's like, say, five games that support it.

01:58:08.280 --> 01:58:12.280
Now you can have like a bunch of games that support it, but it's still going to feel tacked on.

01:58:12.280 --> 01:58:15.280
Maybe this is what I need to make me feel better about this.

01:58:15.280 --> 01:58:18.280
Maybe callers want to input on this 1877 game OLR.

01:58:18.280 --> 01:58:24.280
What game would be better if they went back and added motion control?

01:58:24.280 --> 01:58:31.280
Lair, what Sony PlayStation 3 game is going to be better if they go back and add this whole, you know, Sony,

01:58:31.280 --> 01:58:34.280
it doesn't have an official name, does it yet?

01:58:34.280 --> 01:58:36.280
I think somebody said the PS3 mode.

01:58:36.280 --> 01:58:37.280
Cosmic Ice Cream Cones.

01:58:37.280 --> 01:58:40.280
Okay, the Cosmic Ice Cream Cones.

01:58:40.280 --> 01:58:44.280
What old PlayStation 3 game is going to be better with the Cosmic Ice Cream Cones?

01:58:44.280 --> 01:58:45.280
I don't know.

01:58:45.280 --> 01:58:50.280
Seeing as most PlayStation 3 games are on the Xbox 360, we don't have that yet.

01:58:50.280 --> 01:58:56.280
Here's my thought, maybe they come up with a control scheme for like a first person shooter,

01:58:56.280 --> 01:58:59.280
and then boom, they can put those in the first person shooter games.

01:58:59.280 --> 01:59:01.280
You know, something that works well.

01:59:01.280 --> 01:59:03.280
But yeah, you're right, I don't know.

01:59:03.280 --> 01:59:09.280
Don't you think this is only going to show up though in the actual Sony, you know,

01:59:09.280 --> 01:59:12.280
first party in their own developer type of games?

01:59:12.280 --> 01:59:14.280
Probably, yeah.

01:59:14.280 --> 01:59:16.280
But I mean, I don't know.

01:59:16.280 --> 01:59:25.280
This is all coming from, you know, I want to say it was Jack Trenton who, he says,

01:59:25.280 --> 01:59:29.280
personally it's very difficult for me to perceive God of War 3 played with a Wii controller,

01:59:29.280 --> 01:59:33.280
but it's a different experience that doesn't lend itself to certain types of games,

01:59:33.280 --> 01:59:39.280
but I think our controller can be used with every game that's on the system now

01:59:39.280 --> 01:59:41.280
and every game that we're working on.

01:59:41.280 --> 01:59:44.280
So he could just be blowing smoke up someone's ass, you know.

01:59:44.280 --> 01:59:47.280
My controller's awesome, it works with everything, it's super awesome,

01:59:47.280 --> 01:59:49.280
everything that we touch turns to gold.

01:59:49.280 --> 01:59:53.280
You know, that's basically his thought on it.

01:59:53.280 --> 01:59:56.280
So really we could be reading way too much into this.

01:59:56.280 --> 01:59:59.280
I think the games you're going to see that get this enhancement,

01:59:59.280 --> 02:00:05.280
like Infamous, Killzone 3, all the first person shooters basically,

02:00:05.280 --> 02:00:09.280
Uncharted and Resistance.

02:00:09.280 --> 02:00:13.280
Those will be the games that will support this whole Cosmic Ice Cream codes.

02:00:13.280 --> 02:00:16.280
Honestly, I don't think it's any of these games at all.

02:00:16.280 --> 02:00:21.280
I think since this isn't going to come out for a while, it'll probably be...

02:00:21.280 --> 02:00:24.280
I would be fine if they didn't even patch it backwards,

02:00:24.280 --> 02:00:26.280
because it's just going to be tacking it on.

02:00:26.280 --> 02:00:30.280
It's just, I don't know.

02:00:30.280 --> 02:00:35.280
I mean, it's one-one control, so unless you have it really programmed in the game

02:00:35.280 --> 02:00:38.280
to be really intricate, I don't think it's going to work,

02:00:38.280 --> 02:00:40.280
because you're just going to be making a gesture,

02:00:40.280 --> 02:00:43.280
and it's going to do an action, just like the Wii.

02:00:43.280 --> 02:00:46.280
And I think a lot of it is resources for me.

02:00:46.280 --> 02:00:47.280
That's why I kind of bring this up.

02:00:47.280 --> 02:00:49.280
You know, I know there's a lot of people out there that would say,

02:00:49.280 --> 02:00:50.280
well, what's the harm?

02:00:50.280 --> 02:00:53.280
So they want to go back and add motion control in these games.

02:00:53.280 --> 02:00:54.280
Is that such a bad thing?

02:00:54.280 --> 02:00:56.280
It's added value, it's something extra.

02:00:56.280 --> 02:01:01.280
But I'm saying, well, resources that could be used to instead make new games better.

02:01:01.280 --> 02:01:04.280
Why go back and patch the game with motion controls

02:01:04.280 --> 02:01:07.280
when you can make the sequel have motion controls?

02:01:07.280 --> 02:01:10.280
Then again, I'm also clamoring for some of my old Xbox games

02:01:10.280 --> 02:01:13.280
to still be playable with backwards emulation on Xbox 360,

02:01:13.280 --> 02:01:15.280
which will never happen at this point.

02:01:15.280 --> 02:01:16.280
They're done with that. You know they are.

02:01:16.280 --> 02:01:18.280
They are done.

02:01:18.280 --> 02:01:20.280
Because they want to do the downloads, the digital downloads.

02:01:20.280 --> 02:01:22.280
They're done with classic Xbox at this point.

02:01:22.280 --> 02:01:23.280
The classic Xbox.

02:01:23.280 --> 02:01:25.280
The Xbox 360 digital downloads is where it's at now.

02:01:25.280 --> 02:01:26.280
There's still going to be Xbox originals,

02:01:26.280 --> 02:01:29.280
but it's not going to be anything that wasn't already supported

02:01:29.280 --> 02:01:30.280
with the backwards compatibility.

02:01:30.280 --> 02:01:34.280
There's not going to be any more updates for backwards compatibility,

02:01:34.280 --> 02:01:37.280
unless there really is a team still working on it,

02:01:37.280 --> 02:01:38.280
which I don't think there is.

02:01:38.280 --> 02:01:40.280
I don't think there is either.

02:01:40.280 --> 02:01:43.280
Let's move on and talk about something else with Sony.

02:01:43.280 --> 02:01:48.280
It has to do kind of from the same sort of original source

02:01:48.280 --> 02:01:51.280
that the whole PlayStation 3 motion control can do with.

02:01:51.280 --> 02:01:59.280
I want to talk about the actual president of PlayStation, Jack Trenton, and leaks.

02:01:59.280 --> 02:02:01.280
And a big quote he said.

02:02:01.280 --> 02:02:04.280
It was interesting because at the show,

02:02:04.280 --> 02:02:05.280
when he's actually giving the press conference,

02:02:05.280 --> 02:02:08.280
he joked and was very tongue-in-cheek about the leaks.

02:02:08.280 --> 02:02:11.280
Thank you all for coming out considering everything leaked out.

02:02:11.280 --> 02:02:15.280
He showed his anger a little more this week in an interview

02:02:15.280 --> 02:02:18.280
on a story that was on CSNBC.com this week.

02:02:18.280 --> 02:02:21.280
People don't respect confidentiality in this industry,

02:02:21.280 --> 02:02:23.280
Jack Trenton was quoted as saying.

02:02:23.280 --> 02:02:26.280
It's tough enough to keep a secret within your own company,

02:02:26.280 --> 02:02:30.280
much less when you speak to third parties.

02:02:30.280 --> 02:02:32.280
And they're talking about that right for right now.

02:02:32.280 --> 02:02:35.280
The CNBC article continues on.

02:02:35.280 --> 02:02:37.280
At E3, it was certainly annoying,

02:02:37.280 --> 02:02:40.280
but as we start to get into whatever's next for gaming,

02:02:40.280 --> 02:02:42.280
this type of stuff can really hurt.

02:02:42.280 --> 02:02:45.280
Is that you want to keep features of your machines quiet

02:02:45.280 --> 02:02:48.280
so that your competition doesn't figure out about them,

02:02:48.280 --> 02:02:50.280
but I don't know at the same time.

02:02:50.280 --> 02:02:54.280
A lot of people that work in the game industry stay in the game industry,

02:02:54.280 --> 02:02:56.280
so I would think there's talk amongst people.

02:02:56.280 --> 02:02:59.280
Yes, they all sign NDAs, but I don't think they hold up.

02:02:59.280 --> 02:03:00.280
Sniff out your moles.

02:03:00.280 --> 02:03:04.280
If it's really a big issue for you and you really want to crack down on them,

02:03:04.280 --> 02:03:07.280
start releasing false information,

02:03:07.280 --> 02:03:09.280
and then the people that report on it,

02:03:09.280 --> 02:03:11.280
then you release a different one to each person,

02:03:11.280 --> 02:03:14.280
and the people that report on that, then you know where it came from.

02:03:14.280 --> 02:03:17.280
And then Trenton continues on with this quote.

02:03:17.280 --> 02:03:20.280
This is an industry that has trouble focusing on today.

02:03:20.280 --> 02:03:23.280
We want to constantly talk about tomorrow.

02:03:23.280 --> 02:03:25.280
You have to prepare for people to know things in advance.

02:03:25.280 --> 02:03:28.280
The frustrating thing is they only know a part of the story

02:03:28.280 --> 02:03:31.280
and that opens up a lot of conjecture and misinformation

02:03:31.280 --> 02:03:36.280
that ultimately waters down the reality when you roll it out.

02:03:36.280 --> 02:03:37.280
Really?

02:03:37.280 --> 02:03:40.280
I'm tired of all these podcasters that go on air

02:03:40.280 --> 02:03:43.280
and talk about all the different ways they interpret a patent.

02:03:43.280 --> 02:03:45.280
No, he didn't really say that, but that's the way he's really saying it.

02:03:45.280 --> 02:03:49.280
Really didn't water it down because the PSP Go,

02:03:49.280 --> 02:03:52.280
which has been rumored to be coming out for a while now,

02:03:52.280 --> 02:03:58.280
and then leaked by them, I mean by Sony through Core,

02:03:58.280 --> 02:04:02.280
which really, can you complain about leaks and stuff

02:04:02.280 --> 02:04:06.280
when your own magazine seems to put out the information

02:04:06.280 --> 02:04:08.280
before your present conference?

02:04:08.280 --> 02:04:10.280
Really didn't water it down at all.

02:04:10.280 --> 02:04:12.280
In fact, I don't think it did.

02:04:12.280 --> 02:04:14.280
If anything, it got people's hopes up,

02:04:14.280 --> 02:04:17.280
and then we saw what they announced the features for it,

02:04:17.280 --> 02:04:20.280
and we're like, eh, that sounds stupid.

02:04:20.280 --> 02:04:23.280
It's like, oh, you didn't add a second analog stick?

02:04:23.280 --> 02:04:28.280
Oh, you didn't make it so that, I don't know,

02:04:28.280 --> 02:04:30.280
it does other things other than normal PlayStation?

02:04:30.280 --> 02:04:35.280
Oh, it's not going to be cheaper than the PSP 3000 or something like that?

02:04:35.280 --> 02:04:37.280
It's going to be more expensive? Awesome!

02:04:37.280 --> 02:04:40.280
And most people doing these speculating and rumor mongering

02:04:40.280 --> 02:04:44.280
and blogging on the internet gave the PSP Go the benefit of the doubt.

02:04:44.280 --> 02:04:47.280
A lot of people, ourselves included, when we were on Bobby's show

02:04:47.280 --> 02:04:50.280
and even on our own show talking about the PSP Go,

02:04:50.280 --> 02:04:53.280
what a great entry-level PSP system this is going to be.

02:04:53.280 --> 02:04:56.280
It's going to be a great, cheap device that people are going to use

02:04:56.280 --> 02:04:57.280
and they can get rid of the disks.

02:04:57.280 --> 02:04:59.280
It's going to be cheap, it's going to be easy to use.

02:04:59.280 --> 02:05:05.280
And then, what was the real surprise that we all got slapped with at E3?

02:05:05.280 --> 02:05:08.280
No, I'd like to go on the record saying that I never thought it was a good idea,

02:05:08.280 --> 02:05:13.280
but I did think that the whole not having the UMD drive in there

02:05:13.280 --> 02:05:17.280
was a stupid idea and I couldn't believe that they were that stupid to do that.

02:05:17.280 --> 02:05:19.280
And sure enough, they were that stupid.

02:05:19.280 --> 02:05:21.280
Look, I don't think that's a stupid idea.

02:05:21.280 --> 02:05:25.280
I think it's a fine idea and this whole PSP Go is a fine system,

02:05:25.280 --> 02:05:27.280
but not for $250.

02:05:27.280 --> 02:05:29.280
That price point ruined the whole thing.

02:05:29.280 --> 02:05:31.280
And that was the only surprise that they kept under wraps.

02:05:31.280 --> 02:05:34.280
That's sort of like deja vu if you think about it.

02:05:34.280 --> 02:05:36.280
The price point ruined the whole thing.

02:05:36.280 --> 02:05:41.280
$600 PS3. The price point ruined the whole thing.

02:05:41.280 --> 02:05:45.280
Oh, but it has Blu-Ray and it's $600.

02:05:45.280 --> 02:05:50.280
So whoever is determining what the prices should be at Sony needs to wake the fuck up, basically, is what it is.

02:05:50.280 --> 02:05:55.280
And stop eating crayons, Jamie is yelling from the kitchen.

02:05:55.280 --> 02:06:01.280
Isn't the door supposed to be shut while recording is in progress? No, I'm kidding.

02:06:01.280 --> 02:06:05.280
Alright, if you want to comment on this, 1877 Game OLR,

02:06:05.280 --> 02:06:13.280
looking at some comments in chat, Game Guru says cheap is the term that Sony needs to learn.

02:06:13.280 --> 02:06:17.280
D5T says moving to flash-based media is the future.

02:06:17.280 --> 02:06:19.280
Movable parts are old.

02:06:19.280 --> 02:06:21.280
See, I'm almost with him here.

02:06:21.280 --> 02:06:26.280
I mean, you can't say Sony, screw you, for losing UMD when you're also watching on the same token.

02:06:26.280 --> 02:06:31.280
Microsoft's now getting into digital distribution with the whole classic Xbox 360 games,

02:06:31.280 --> 02:06:35.280
or I'm sorry, new Xbox 360 games available for download on the site.

02:06:35.280 --> 02:06:42.280
We were talking in the first half of the show tonight about Xbox possibly launching a cheaper console next year

02:06:42.280 --> 02:06:44.280
that's going to be targeted at the family audience.

02:06:44.280 --> 02:06:49.280
Who's to say that if they do that, this system is going to lose the disk drive completely

02:06:49.280 --> 02:06:55.280
and could possibly be an online-only download thing using the hand-wavy Natal device to make you choose your games?

02:06:55.280 --> 02:06:58.280
It won't work because people like buying stuff.

02:06:58.280 --> 02:07:00.280
They like having the physical disk in their hand.

02:07:00.280 --> 02:07:05.280
And yeah, I know people that have the iPhone stuff go crazy over the App Store because there's everything in there.

02:07:05.280 --> 02:07:07.280
But you know what?

02:07:07.280 --> 02:07:11.280
It's just, if you could go, if it took like disks or something like that,

02:07:11.280 --> 02:07:14.280
I'm sure people would probably want to buy this because you know what?

02:07:14.280 --> 02:07:15.280
You know what you can do with disks?

02:07:15.280 --> 02:07:18.280
You can return them when they don't work.

02:07:18.280 --> 02:07:20.280
You can return them when you don't like them.

02:07:20.280 --> 02:07:23.280
You can return them when you're done with them.

02:07:23.280 --> 02:07:24.280
You can resell them.

02:07:24.280 --> 02:07:27.280
Digital download, you bought it, you're stuck with it.

02:07:27.280 --> 02:07:29.280
If it sucks, too bad. You bought it.

02:07:29.280 --> 02:07:36.280
Dekeman in our chatroom, chat.orangelandtraded.com, says the reason they gave for the price was to compete with the iPhone.

02:07:36.280 --> 02:07:38.280
If Apple can do it, then so can we.

02:07:38.280 --> 02:07:39.280
And the funny thing was they dropped them.

02:07:39.280 --> 02:07:43.280
Basically, they think they can get away with it since people pay for it.

02:07:43.280 --> 02:07:47.280
Apple's tech, they'll pay it for ours.

02:07:47.280 --> 02:07:49.280
Oh, well, whoops.

02:07:49.280 --> 02:07:53.280
It was just announced this week that the iPhone's coming down to $99.

02:07:53.280 --> 02:07:57.280
Now it's going to cost $99 for somebody to get an iPhone.

02:07:57.280 --> 02:08:00.280
Granted, yeah, they're going to have to sign away their life on the two-year contract.

02:08:00.280 --> 02:08:01.280
But guess what?

02:08:01.280 --> 02:08:03.280
Most people don't think about that.

02:08:03.280 --> 02:08:10.280
They just think, ooh, shiny, $99 iPhone, and hey, I'll sign this two-year contract because that's how long I expect this to last anyway.

02:08:10.280 --> 02:08:15.280
And seriously, if Sony didn't see that one coming, they are mentally deficient.

02:08:15.280 --> 02:08:19.280
And whoever did not see that one coming at Sony needs to be fired.

02:08:19.280 --> 02:08:22.280
They have no business working in business.

02:08:22.280 --> 02:08:31.280
A moron walking off the street, my mother, who doesn't even know how to put a CD in a computer, could tell you.

02:08:31.280 --> 02:08:38.280
Apple, I love my mom, but she's technically stupid, and I can say that in the nicest possible way.

02:08:38.280 --> 02:08:48.280
Even my mother knows every June Apple gets up there, parades out Steve Jobs.

02:08:48.280 --> 02:08:51.280
They couldn't do that this year, obviously, with their one more thing.

02:08:51.280 --> 02:08:58.280
Everybody knows Apple upgrades their shit every year and gets people to buy it all over again.

02:08:58.280 --> 02:08:59.280
It works for Apple.

02:08:59.280 --> 02:09:02.280
It is not going to work for Sony at those prices.

02:09:02.280 --> 02:09:08.280
Sony is not Apple, and the other thing, too, is they have a huge following with Apple.

02:09:08.280 --> 02:09:11.280
Sony doesn't quite have that following with the PSP.

02:09:11.280 --> 02:09:20.280
And to be honest, and I really, really hate to say this, there's more features in the iPhone than there are right now in the PSP.

02:09:20.280 --> 02:09:22.280
I mean, it's got a touch screen on it.

02:09:22.280 --> 02:09:26.280
Hell, if they added a touch screen to the PSP, that might be a whole different story.

02:09:26.280 --> 02:09:29.280
Hey, that might be worth picking up, because that's completely different.

02:09:29.280 --> 02:09:37.280
It's going to open up a whole different set of possibilities if they had support with, like, I know it has support now with Bluetooth or something like that.

02:09:37.280 --> 02:09:39.280
Big whoop. Oh, goody.

02:09:39.280 --> 02:09:48.280
And look, and to those that want to make the argument that, well, Apple releases their new toys at high-end prices.

02:09:48.280 --> 02:09:50.280
You know, granted, I'll give you that.

02:09:50.280 --> 02:09:53.280
Their laptops, I don't think I'm going to buy another Apple laptop.

02:09:53.280 --> 02:09:56.280
They are too expensive for what you get.

02:09:56.280 --> 02:09:58.280
For someone like me.

02:09:58.280 --> 02:10:01.280
Your mic's not on, dear.

02:10:01.280 --> 02:10:03.280
Oh, shit.

02:10:03.280 --> 02:10:17.280
I went to talking with some other people in the art industry, you know, and a couple people were actually saying that they were noticing that there's not as much need for people to have a Mac these days.

02:10:17.280 --> 02:10:25.280
In the industry, now that the PCs are catching up and, you know, different programs are saying, hey, people actually use PCs, you know.

02:10:25.280 --> 02:10:29.280
So even that edge is starting to blur a little bit.

02:10:29.280 --> 02:10:33.280
I think Apple's in for a rude awakening in the laptop market within the next couple years.

02:10:33.280 --> 02:10:35.280
But they've got it on the iPhone.

02:10:35.280 --> 02:10:38.280
I mean, you know, Apple right now is a phone company.

02:10:38.280 --> 02:10:40.280
That is what Apple is doing best.

02:10:40.280 --> 02:10:42.280
They are a phone and music company.

02:10:42.280 --> 02:10:45.280
They don't really, well, God, I'm going to get so much hate mail for this.

02:10:45.280 --> 02:10:54.280
But look, as somebody who's going out there wanting to get a new laptop and so forth, I cannot look at these two things.

02:10:54.280 --> 02:10:57.280
Like you look at a Mac laptop over here and then a PC that does all the same stuff.

02:10:57.280 --> 02:10:59.280
I can't continue to do that anymore.

02:10:59.280 --> 02:11:02.280
However, Apple has it nailed on the iPhone.

02:11:02.280 --> 02:11:06.280
$199 for their newest model, the 3GS.

02:11:06.280 --> 02:11:09.280
Granted, yes, you're signing these contracts, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

02:11:09.280 --> 02:11:10.280
People are probably going to do it anyway.

02:11:10.280 --> 02:11:15.280
But look, you have the $199 iPhone, the $249 PSP Go.

02:11:15.280 --> 02:11:17.280
I can watch movies on both.

02:11:17.280 --> 02:11:18.280
Check.

02:11:18.280 --> 02:11:19.280
I can get on the internet with both.

02:11:19.280 --> 02:11:20.280
Check.

02:11:20.280 --> 02:11:21.280
I can play music on both.

02:11:21.280 --> 02:11:22.280
Check.

02:11:22.280 --> 02:11:25.280
I can play games on both that I download online.

02:11:25.280 --> 02:11:26.280
Check.

02:11:26.280 --> 02:11:31.280
The only thing the Sony PSP has got is that the games are of a higher caliber than the ones you see on the iPhone.

02:11:31.280 --> 02:11:32.280
I will give it that.

02:11:32.280 --> 02:11:44.280
Right now, and supposedly the 3GS has better specs or something than the 3G, so maybe they will be a little bit better later on.

02:11:44.280 --> 02:11:51.280
And it also doesn't have actual control pads, so that does kind of limit them as far as games go.

02:11:51.280 --> 02:11:59.280
Rama in chat says, Rob Roberts, everything you have done on your MacBook can be done on a $500 PC laptop flawlessly.

02:11:59.280 --> 02:12:01.280
That's what I'm starting to find out, too.

02:12:01.280 --> 02:12:05.280
And part of what I loved about Macs is that they were so easy, you know, so great.

02:12:05.280 --> 02:12:06.280
But here's the nice thing.

02:12:06.280 --> 02:12:12.280
Finally, someone at Microsoft kind of wised up, oh my gosh, Apple's starting to bite into us a little bit here with this whole...

02:12:12.280 --> 02:12:14.280
I think they're making it easier.

02:12:14.280 --> 02:12:15.280
I don't know.

02:12:15.280 --> 02:12:17.280
I'm going to open up this whole can of worms on the computer debate.

02:12:17.280 --> 02:12:18.280
That's not what I want to do.

02:12:18.280 --> 02:12:26.280
I want to talk about the PSP Go and all this stuff, you know, and the whole fact that it's $249 is way too much to be charging for that.

02:12:26.280 --> 02:12:28.280
Actually, that wasn't even really originally what I wanted to talk about.

02:12:28.280 --> 02:12:33.280
It was supposed to be about keeping secrets in the industry and people not respecting confidentiality in the industry.

02:12:33.280 --> 02:12:44.280
Is that, you know, there's this fine line here where people want to know everything.

02:12:44.280 --> 02:12:45.280
You know what I mean?

02:12:45.280 --> 02:12:51.280
And there's such a real dog-eat-dog thing in the media and these blogs right now.

02:12:51.280 --> 02:12:53.280
Every blog wants to be first.

02:12:53.280 --> 02:12:55.280
Every blog wants to have the exclusive.

02:12:55.280 --> 02:13:02.280
Blogs get pissed off when other blogs steal their stories that were an exclusive and so on and all of this.

02:13:02.280 --> 02:13:07.280
How much is too much in regards to confidentiality?

02:13:07.280 --> 02:13:09.280
I mean, the demand is out there.

02:13:09.280 --> 02:13:10.280
People want to know.

02:13:10.280 --> 02:13:14.280
The millisecond these things are thought of, Sony is even thinking about doing this.

02:13:14.280 --> 02:13:16.280
People want to know about it.

02:13:16.280 --> 02:13:19.280
How far is too far with this whole confidentiality?

02:13:19.280 --> 02:13:20.280
Did this go too far?

02:13:20.280 --> 02:13:25.280
Did the PSP go getting announced early and a lot of these other things, was that too far?

02:13:25.280 --> 02:13:27.280
I don't know.

02:13:27.280 --> 02:13:28.280
I don't have an easy answer for this.

02:13:28.280 --> 02:13:29.280
Then don't tell these people.

02:13:29.280 --> 02:13:32.280
If you want to keep a secret, you don't say anything.

02:13:32.280 --> 02:13:36.280
You don't keep a secret by saying, go and tell 100 people.

02:13:36.280 --> 02:13:37.280
Oh, by the way, don't tell anybody this.

02:13:37.280 --> 02:13:41.280
But don't you have to tell your developers that they're going to be making the games?

02:13:41.280 --> 02:13:45.280
Well, obviously someone else is blogging about it and leaking this stuff out.

02:13:45.280 --> 02:13:50.280
You have people that are leaking out stuff all the time and they can hide behind the Internet.

02:13:50.280 --> 02:13:51.280
They can be whomever.

02:13:51.280 --> 02:13:56.280
They can be some industry mole and go on the record and stuff.

02:13:56.280 --> 02:14:04.280
And they probably get some sort of joy out of having the exclusive story that no one knows about.

02:14:04.280 --> 02:14:07.280
I mean, we've kind of also seen the other side of that too.

02:14:07.280 --> 02:14:11.280
We once blew somebody's exclusive and they threatened to cut us off at the balls.

02:14:11.280 --> 02:14:14.280
And it was kind of one of these things where it's like, well, wait a minute.

02:14:14.280 --> 02:14:17.280
How come all these other people can get away with it?

02:14:17.280 --> 02:14:25.280
And we've also seen it in the past too with NDAs where other people are given preferential treatment

02:14:25.280 --> 02:14:30.280
because they're a big website and they're going to run an exclusive story.

02:14:30.280 --> 02:14:33.280
Oh, let's decide which website gets to run the exclusive story.

02:14:33.280 --> 02:14:38.280
And that's the shit that needs to stop right now because that's just encouraging people to one-up others.

02:14:38.280 --> 02:14:40.280
I'm sorry. No pun intended.

02:14:40.280 --> 02:14:45.280
Anyhow, let's move on.

02:14:45.280 --> 02:14:49.280
See, now they're getting into the PC Mac debate and chat and I'm so sorry I opened that can of worms.

02:14:49.280 --> 02:14:51.280
Look, buy what you like, like what you like.

02:14:51.280 --> 02:14:53.280
Just have fun with it.

02:14:53.280 --> 02:14:57.280
It's your money.

02:14:57.280 --> 02:14:59.280
Buy whatever you want.

02:14:59.280 --> 02:15:05.280
All I'm saying is that from my perspective right now as an average laptop user who wants to use Internet and all this stuff,

02:15:05.280 --> 02:15:08.280
I've bought the MacBook before and it broke.

02:15:08.280 --> 02:15:10.280
I thought Macs were never supposed to break.

02:15:10.280 --> 02:15:13.280
They were supposed to be infallible machines that never get viruses and so forth.

02:15:13.280 --> 02:15:16.280
And now I'm sitting here and I've really had to reevaluate this whole thing.

02:15:16.280 --> 02:15:19.280
Is it worth it for me to spend that much on a computer again?

02:15:19.280 --> 02:15:21.280
And for the things I want to do, I don't think it is.

02:15:21.280 --> 02:15:25.280
Not until the apples come way down in price to be competitive with the PCs.

02:15:25.280 --> 02:15:27.280
That's what I'm saying.

02:15:27.280 --> 02:15:31.280
And removing features to cut costs is not an answer, Apple.

02:15:31.280 --> 02:15:34.280
So, anyhow, sorry.

02:15:34.280 --> 02:15:36.280
I apologize for getting completely off track.

02:15:36.280 --> 02:15:38.280
Let's get back to video games.

02:15:38.280 --> 02:15:40.280
Oh, what a video game on the next story, correct?

02:15:40.280 --> 02:15:51.280
Yes. Of course, this is a classic and a remade game now coming to Xbox Live Arcade as an exclusive for a limited time.

02:15:51.280 --> 02:15:57.280
That would be, of course, the brand new, or I guess, brand new remake.

02:15:57.280 --> 02:16:02.280
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Turtles in Time re-shelled, which looks pretty awesome, actually.

02:16:02.280 --> 02:16:10.280
Completely redone 3D and, of course, will be available on Xbox Live Arcade July 22nd.

02:16:10.280 --> 02:16:17.280
But, as for the PlayStation Network, later this year.

02:16:17.280 --> 02:16:24.280
Well, I guess that's pretty cool that the games got dated and so forth, but how about the whole exclusive window thing?

02:16:24.280 --> 02:16:26.280
I mean, is this another blow to Sony?

02:16:26.280 --> 02:16:36.280
Is this simply a limit of, I don't know, are they saying that they actually have bought the timed exclusive window to this?

02:16:36.280 --> 02:16:37.280
No.

02:16:37.280 --> 02:16:40.280
Or is there some underlying technical problem that's causing this to be delayed on Sony?

02:16:40.280 --> 02:16:41.280
I don't think there's a technical problem at all.

02:16:41.280 --> 02:16:49.280
I think it's a deal, because if you think about it, this is actually part of the Summer of Live, or the Live Arcade Summer of Arcade, whatever the hell they're calling that.

02:16:49.280 --> 02:16:56.280
So, they're gonna get an extra marketing push because of that, and probably the deal was that they gotta put it out later because of that.

02:16:56.280 --> 02:16:58.280
What marketing push?

02:16:58.280 --> 02:17:04.280
I mean, really, is being in the Summer of Arcade that much of a boost to sales?

02:17:04.280 --> 02:17:05.280
It might be.

02:17:05.280 --> 02:17:06.280
Really?

02:17:06.280 --> 02:17:09.280
What do they do? What's the big deal about being in the Summer of Arcade?

02:17:09.280 --> 02:17:13.280
The fact that they cluster a lot of highly anticipated games all together.

02:17:13.280 --> 02:17:19.280
But for most Xbox Live Arcade games, I can think of anything I've anticipated, I knew where to seek it out and buy it.

02:17:19.280 --> 02:17:22.280
Do they run extra ads in magazines?

02:17:22.280 --> 02:17:25.280
They have a splash trailer thing or something, I don't know.

02:17:25.280 --> 02:17:28.280
I guess. It just doesn't seem like that much of a boost.

02:17:28.280 --> 02:17:30.280
Well, I'm just speculating, I don't know.

02:17:30.280 --> 02:17:34.280
Maybe they had trouble developing on the PlayStation Network. I don't know what it is.

02:17:34.280 --> 02:17:37.280
I don't think they would because Ubisoft would imagine.

02:17:37.280 --> 02:17:39.280
Well, they're publishing it. Who knows who's developing it?

02:17:39.280 --> 02:17:43.280
I mean, I don't know.

02:17:43.280 --> 02:17:47.280
It could be something retarded. It probably is something retarded.

02:17:47.280 --> 02:17:50.280
But you know what? Just get used to it.

02:17:50.280 --> 02:17:52.280
I need to see more of this game in action.

02:17:52.280 --> 02:17:58.280
So it's just pretty much a port of the old arcade game, but with those kind of cooler, upgraded graphics?

02:17:58.280 --> 02:17:59.280
Yeah.

02:17:59.280 --> 02:18:01.280
Huh. I guess that's kind of neat.

02:18:01.280 --> 02:18:06.280
I know there's a lot of folks in our chat room that are anticipating the whole Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles game.

02:18:06.280 --> 02:18:11.280
Of course, they're still arguing about PCs and Macs, so I don't really have a lot of comments to read.

02:18:11.280 --> 02:18:13.280
Hey, I don't have to say anything anymore.

02:18:13.280 --> 02:18:15.280
Hold on, let's see. Rama in chat says,

02:18:15.280 --> 02:18:19.280
Super NES exclusive. Wasn't the Super Famicom version a direct port?

02:18:19.280 --> 02:18:21.280
I don't know what game they're even talking about there.

02:18:21.280 --> 02:18:22.280
Maybe Turtles.

02:18:22.280 --> 02:18:25.280
Oh, it must be the same thing. Oh yeah, because Marin said earlier,

02:18:25.280 --> 02:18:28.280
just play your Super Nintendo copy of the game like I will.

02:18:28.280 --> 02:18:33.280
I guess, yeah, this whole timed exclusive thing does go back a little bit even to the days of Super Nintendo and Genesis.

02:18:33.280 --> 02:18:37.280
Mortal Kombat was out on the Super Nintendo for a while before the Genesis, right? Am I right?

02:18:37.280 --> 02:18:42.280
I know Street Fighter was, but then when it came out on the Genesis, they got, ooh, Championship Edition.

02:18:42.280 --> 02:18:46.280
And that whole thing. Maybe they did come out at the same time. I think I was thinking of Street Fighter.

02:18:46.280 --> 02:18:49.280
It was a long time ago.

02:18:49.280 --> 02:18:54.280
And then Dark Tetsuya says, I forget, I just remember the Super Nintendo version having the extra levels and bosses.

02:18:54.280 --> 02:18:57.280
Ooh, are we getting some of that in this? Extra levels and stuff?

02:18:57.280 --> 02:18:58.280
There might be extra levels.

02:18:58.280 --> 02:19:03.280
I mean, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles was a pretty huge Xbox Live game when it came out anyway.

02:19:03.280 --> 02:19:07.280
Folks playing it online and having fun on Live with it, so I'm sure this is going to be no different.

02:19:07.280 --> 02:19:08.280
I'm sure it'll be fun.

02:19:08.280 --> 02:19:09.280
Yeah.

02:19:09.280 --> 02:19:10.280
So, there you go.

02:19:10.280 --> 02:19:17.280
Alright, well that game will be coming out July 22nd, I believe it was, so keep an eye out for that.

02:19:17.280 --> 02:19:20.280
Moving on with more news, Metal Gear Solid Rising.

02:19:20.280 --> 02:19:26.280
Of course, this was the whole moment at E3 where they came out at the Microsoft press conference.

02:19:26.280 --> 02:19:32.280
The Xbox is getting Metal Gear Solid Rising.

02:19:32.280 --> 02:19:35.280
And a lot of people were waiting for it, the whole Metal Gear Solid 4 thing.

02:19:35.280 --> 02:19:40.280
Of course, now it should be noted, Metal Gear Solid Rising is not exclusive to the Xbox.

02:19:40.280 --> 02:19:43.280
It's going on Xbox and PlayStation.

02:19:43.280 --> 02:19:46.280
And a lot of folks are saying, well, it's going to still be.

02:19:46.280 --> 02:19:49.280
It's like Metal Gear is continuing on or what have you.

02:19:49.280 --> 02:19:54.280
But, apparently, it is a whole new engine for Metal Gear Solid Rising.

02:19:54.280 --> 02:20:01.280
If you're thinking this is Metal Gear Solid 4 Plus or some game that was made in Metal Gear Solid 4's engine, uh-uh.

02:20:01.280 --> 02:20:09.280
Sean Eyestone, who is an assistant producer at Kojima Productions, says the team is remaking Rising's engine from scratch.

02:20:09.280 --> 02:20:15.280
Their goal, I should say, to make it look better than Metal Gear Solid 4.

02:20:15.280 --> 02:20:20.280
And this is from a Kojima Productions podcast that came out this week.

02:20:20.280 --> 02:20:24.280
Apparently, they are saying it is a big project like Metal Gear Solid 4.

02:20:24.280 --> 02:20:29.280
The team is serious about making it look as good as possible on every platform.

02:20:29.280 --> 02:20:31.280
That's kind of cool.

02:20:31.280 --> 02:20:33.280
I mean, who cares? So what?

02:20:33.280 --> 02:20:37.280
So Metal Gear Solid 4 came out and was exclusive to the Sony.

02:20:37.280 --> 02:20:39.280
Good for them. How well is it selling now?

02:20:39.280 --> 02:20:42.280
Still okay, but not what it used to be selling.

02:20:42.280 --> 02:20:47.280
I don't think anyone is buying the system nowadays from Metal Gear Solid 4.

02:20:47.280 --> 02:20:56.280
And now it's coming out on both systems, because I think they know that it would be a mistake to skip on the 360.

02:20:56.280 --> 02:21:01.280
Because there is a lot of potential sales there, especially now that they didn't have Metal Gear Solid 4.

02:21:01.280 --> 02:21:04.280
And so they're going to get a lot more money out of it.

02:21:04.280 --> 02:21:07.280
And it's all about money nowadays, because times are tough.

02:21:07.280 --> 02:21:10.280
So I'm not surprised.

02:21:10.280 --> 02:21:12.280
And I am... I don't know.

02:21:12.280 --> 02:21:15.280
It'd be weird if they kind of went in the opposite direction.

02:21:15.280 --> 02:21:19.280
But it makes sense to them, just to put it out on both systems.

02:21:19.280 --> 02:21:22.280
The Rob D. in chat, by the way, says,

02:21:22.280 --> 02:21:25.280
So we're going from talking about a turtles game to talking about Solid Snakes.

02:21:25.280 --> 02:21:27.280
What does this show become?

02:21:27.280 --> 02:21:29.280
It has this reptile jungle tonight on Orange Lawns Radio, apparently.

02:21:29.280 --> 02:21:33.280
Chat.orangelawnsradio.com if you want to make a smart ass comment like that one.

02:21:33.280 --> 02:21:40.280
But, you know, I guess at first, when I first heard about this, I was like,

02:21:40.280 --> 02:21:44.280
Oh, they're cranking this game out so fast because Metal Gear Solid 4,

02:21:44.280 --> 02:21:46.280
they're just going to reuse that engine, and so forth.

02:21:46.280 --> 02:21:49.280
But now, that doesn't seem to be the case.

02:21:49.280 --> 02:21:53.280
So, you could look at this a couple of ways.

02:21:53.280 --> 02:21:54.280
I get really excited when I hear,

02:21:54.280 --> 02:21:57.280
Oh, they're going to make it look even better, and so forth.

02:21:57.280 --> 02:22:00.280
But weren't they saying one of the reasons that they didn't port

02:22:00.280 --> 02:22:03.280
Metal Gear Solid 4 to the Xbox 360?

02:22:03.280 --> 02:22:06.280
And let's face it, folks, they never will at this point.

02:22:06.280 --> 02:22:07.280
It is not happening.

02:22:07.280 --> 02:22:08.280
This is what you're getting.

02:22:08.280 --> 02:22:10.280
Be happy with this, Microsoft fans.

02:22:10.280 --> 02:22:13.280
There is not Metal Gear Solid 4 coming into the Xbox 360.

02:22:13.280 --> 02:22:17.280
If that was ever going to happen, it would have been announced before this.

02:22:17.280 --> 02:22:21.280
So, that being said, is it possible,

02:22:21.280 --> 02:22:25.280
they said that Metal Gear Solid 4 would not be ported to the Xbox 360

02:22:25.280 --> 02:22:28.280
because it was made for Blu-ray.

02:22:28.280 --> 02:22:31.280
The types of graphics that were on it and everything that was packed in that disk

02:22:31.280 --> 02:22:33.280
was made for Blu-ray.

02:22:33.280 --> 02:22:36.280
So that makes me think, OK, well then by that argument,

02:22:36.280 --> 02:22:40.280
if they're scaling this back to fit every platform,

02:22:40.280 --> 02:22:43.280
they're going to have to scale it back, not make it better.

02:22:43.280 --> 02:22:44.280
Wrong.

02:22:44.280 --> 02:22:47.280
And this goes back to what we were talking about earlier.

02:22:47.280 --> 02:22:50.280
Metal Gear Solid 4 was going to max out the PS3,

02:22:50.280 --> 02:22:53.280
but now they've learned that they can optimize their code.

02:22:53.280 --> 02:22:54.280
There's different techniques.

02:22:54.280 --> 02:22:56.280
And to be honest, their excuse was,

02:22:56.280 --> 02:22:59.280
Oh, it's so big it can only fit on Blu-ray.

02:22:59.280 --> 02:23:03.280
But at the same time, oh, and no one wants to swap disks, by the way,

02:23:03.280 --> 02:23:06.280
which is retarded because there's a five-minute install

02:23:06.280 --> 02:23:09.280
between sections of the game.

02:23:09.280 --> 02:23:10.280
I mean, come on.

02:23:10.280 --> 02:23:12.280
They could have easily swapped disks.

02:23:12.280 --> 02:23:14.280
I'd rather spend two seconds to swap a disk

02:23:14.280 --> 02:23:18.280
than to spend five minutes loading a section of the game to my hard drive.

02:23:18.280 --> 02:23:20.280
And if I really wanted to do that with multiple disks,

02:23:20.280 --> 02:23:24.280
I could do that now in the new Microsoft interface.

02:23:24.280 --> 02:23:26.280
I can install each portion if I wanted to.

02:23:26.280 --> 02:23:28.280
TigerKlonChat makes a really good point.

02:23:28.280 --> 02:23:31.280
It says, also notice Metal Gear Solid Rising says,

02:23:31.280 --> 02:23:32.280
Lightning Bolt action.

02:23:32.280 --> 02:23:34.280
Maybe it's a new type of gameplay.

02:23:34.280 --> 02:23:38.280
Given that Raiden is a ninja, it could very well be a hack and slash game.

02:23:38.280 --> 02:23:41.280
Have we had anything confirmed that this is a stealth action game

02:23:41.280 --> 02:23:43.280
like the other Metal Gear Solid games?

02:23:43.280 --> 02:23:45.280
Or is TigerKlon to something here?

02:23:45.280 --> 02:23:47.280
Because it's not Metal Gear Solid 5.

02:23:47.280 --> 02:23:50.280
It's Metal Gear Solid Rising.

02:23:50.280 --> 02:23:53.280
Maybe the type of game we're anticipating here should be,

02:23:53.280 --> 02:23:55.280
maybe we need to set our expectations for something different.

02:23:55.280 --> 02:23:58.280
Maybe we're looking at an action game, a beat-em-up.

02:23:58.280 --> 02:23:59.280
I don't know about that.

02:23:59.280 --> 02:24:03.280
Turtles in Time version of Metal Gear Solid.

02:24:03.280 --> 02:24:05.280
I don't know about that far.

02:24:05.280 --> 02:24:07.280
But that is interesting that it doesn't say anything

02:24:07.280 --> 02:24:10.280
about the whole stealth, it's lightning bolt action.

02:24:13.280 --> 02:24:16.280
Do you think that would be as successful if they change up the genre?

02:24:19.280 --> 02:24:21.280
Maybe. Maybe not.

02:24:21.280 --> 02:24:23.280
I guess it just depends on how good the game is.

02:24:23.280 --> 02:24:25.280
I think people will bitch and moan, but they'll probably still buy it

02:24:25.280 --> 02:24:27.280
because they're Metal Gear Solid fans.

02:24:27.280 --> 02:24:28.280
Perhaps.

02:24:28.280 --> 02:24:29.280
Alright, we'll see.

02:24:29.280 --> 02:24:31.280
Let's continue on with some more news.

02:24:31.280 --> 02:24:35.280
If you want to call us on this or any topic we're talking about,

02:24:35.280 --> 02:24:37.280
give us a call at 1-877-GAME-OLR.

02:24:37.280 --> 02:24:38.280
We haven't had a phone call in a little while.

02:24:38.280 --> 02:24:39.280
Don't be shy.

02:24:39.280 --> 02:24:41.280
Give us a call at 1-877-GAME-OLR.

02:24:41.280 --> 02:24:46.280
Well, Xbox Live community games, they're getting a little bit of a facelift.

02:24:46.280 --> 02:24:50.280
Starting in late July, Xbox Live community games

02:24:50.280 --> 02:24:56.280
will now be changing to Xbox Live Indie games.

02:24:56.280 --> 02:25:00.280
And apparently it's in response to community feedback

02:25:00.280 --> 02:25:05.280
in order to increase understanding and promote the games.

02:25:05.280 --> 02:25:09.280
So they're going to launch XNA Game Studio 3.1.

02:25:09.280 --> 02:25:18.280
And apparently the game creators have, I guess they want to change

02:25:18.280 --> 02:25:20.280
the appearance of the community games.

02:25:20.280 --> 02:25:23.280
And indie games, it makes more sense.

02:25:23.280 --> 02:25:26.280
Because community games, you kind of think of games made out of someone's garage.

02:25:26.280 --> 02:25:30.280
Whereas indie games, you know, indie movies, sometimes they're gems

02:25:30.280 --> 02:25:33.280
and they're just created with lower budget.

02:25:33.280 --> 02:25:36.280
Maybe indie games will kind of give off that impression

02:25:36.280 --> 02:25:41.280
that it's just going to be good games with lower budget.

02:25:41.280 --> 02:25:44.280
I don't know about you, but I look at the XNA stuff

02:25:44.280 --> 02:25:46.280
and there's a lot of it that sucks out there.

02:25:46.280 --> 02:25:48.280
And there's a lot of stuff on there now.

02:25:48.280 --> 02:25:51.280
I mean, a ton of things that you can play.

02:25:51.280 --> 02:25:53.280
And a lot of them are really good.

02:25:53.280 --> 02:25:56.280
But a lot of them are really, really bad.

02:25:56.280 --> 02:25:59.280
What do you think about this whole rating system that's coming into the games?

02:25:59.280 --> 02:26:01.280
Is this going to be a good thing or a bad thing?

02:26:01.280 --> 02:26:02.280
I think it's a good thing.

02:26:02.280 --> 02:26:06.280
It'll be able to separate the crap from the not-crap.

02:26:06.280 --> 02:26:09.280
And I would love to see user-rated stuff.

02:26:09.280 --> 02:26:12.280
So I can look at these games that people think are great.

02:26:12.280 --> 02:26:16.280
Maybe have a way that you can see what your friends rate it or something like that.

02:26:16.280 --> 02:26:18.280
So if I have similar tastes to, say, Rob,

02:26:18.280 --> 02:26:21.280
I can play the games that he likes or something like that.

02:26:21.280 --> 02:26:22.280
Now that's a good idea.

02:26:22.280 --> 02:26:26.280
Maybe what I'm worried about with ratings is that in theory it sounds like a good idea.

02:26:26.280 --> 02:26:27.280
But do you know what I'm worried about?

02:26:27.280 --> 02:26:29.280
The dig effect.

02:26:29.280 --> 02:26:33.280
You know how stories get bumped to the top of dig.com that you're like,

02:26:33.280 --> 02:26:34.280
why the hell is this here?

02:26:34.280 --> 02:26:38.280
And it's because so-and-so has millions of friends that will dig up the story for them.

02:26:38.280 --> 02:26:41.280
And to be fair, we've had it happen to our stories before,

02:26:41.280 --> 02:26:43.280
and I'm sure that's thanks to our OL Army.

02:26:43.280 --> 02:26:44.280
So don't hear me wrong.

02:26:44.280 --> 02:26:47.280
It's not necessarily a bad thing or whatever.

02:26:47.280 --> 02:26:52.280
I would be worried in regards to this context of the whole indie games is that

02:26:52.280 --> 02:26:57.280
what if a game maker whose game isn't really good

02:26:57.280 --> 02:27:00.280
has 100 friends to go on there and rate it as great.

02:27:00.280 --> 02:27:05.280
That's going to give it exposure it doesn't really deserve, I guess you could say.

02:27:05.280 --> 02:27:07.280
And it's the same thing with iTunes reviews,

02:27:07.280 --> 02:27:10.280
because I went off a couple weeks on the show.

02:27:10.280 --> 02:27:12.280
A couple weeks ago on the show I was going off about,

02:27:12.280 --> 02:27:16.280
I'm pissed off that somebody would actually take the time to write a negative review

02:27:16.280 --> 02:27:19.280
about our show and post it with all the...

02:27:19.280 --> 02:27:25.280
Granted, if somebody's saying things that have merit and real constructive criticism,

02:27:25.280 --> 02:27:26.280
then I would shut up.

02:27:26.280 --> 02:27:29.280
Then I would take the criticism and see what we can do with that.

02:27:29.280 --> 02:27:35.280
But it sucks that somebody who might be a fan of some other show

02:27:35.280 --> 02:27:38.280
who doesn't know how to support any podcasting,

02:27:38.280 --> 02:27:40.280
who deserves to have karma bite him in the ass or something,

02:27:40.280 --> 02:27:43.280
can have somebody go around and rate a bunch of other shows a 1

02:27:43.280 --> 02:27:46.280
and no action gets taken against that user.

02:27:46.280 --> 02:27:50.280
That user's opinion carries just as much weight

02:27:50.280 --> 02:27:52.280
as somebody who actually thinks out their reviews.

02:27:52.280 --> 02:27:54.280
Does that make any sense at all what I'm saying?

02:27:54.280 --> 02:27:55.280
Yeah, it makes sense.

02:27:55.280 --> 02:27:58.280
I would fear that just because somebody has a lot of friends,

02:27:58.280 --> 02:28:01.280
their game gets all this extra exposure.

02:28:01.280 --> 02:28:04.280
And you look at the top shows on iTunes,

02:28:04.280 --> 02:28:05.280
again going back to iTunes, sorry,

02:28:05.280 --> 02:28:07.280
but it's something I feel pretty passionate about.

02:28:07.280 --> 02:28:09.280
You look at all the top shows on iTunes,

02:28:09.280 --> 02:28:14.280
most of them are 1Ups, IGNs, Game Spots, G4s,

02:28:14.280 --> 02:28:17.280
commercial, down your throat type fare.

02:28:17.280 --> 02:28:20.280
And it kind of sucks for the rest of us

02:28:20.280 --> 02:28:23.280
when podcasts were supposed to be an indie thing.

02:28:23.280 --> 02:28:26.280
Until the mainstream jumped on board

02:28:26.280 --> 02:28:30.280
because they saw it as a way to reach out to the community.

02:28:30.280 --> 02:28:33.280
And now podcasts are everywhere.

02:28:33.280 --> 02:28:37.280
And then at the same time, taking it a step further,

02:28:37.280 --> 02:28:40.280
somebody who has the 100 friends that are willing to do

02:28:40.280 --> 02:28:44.280
whatever they say or whatever, go and spam this game a 1

02:28:44.280 --> 02:28:47.280
just because they don't like the person that made it

02:28:47.280 --> 02:28:48.280
or what have you.

02:28:48.280 --> 02:28:51.280
Or there's a competing game in the genre

02:28:51.280 --> 02:28:53.280
that they don't want to have more exposure.

02:28:53.280 --> 02:28:57.280
I could just see this ratings thing used for bad purposes.

02:28:57.280 --> 02:29:00.280
And I hope there's a way, like you're saying, Loki,

02:29:00.280 --> 02:29:03.280
to either see what my friends rated games

02:29:03.280 --> 02:29:06.280
and only base my judgment off what my friends think of games

02:29:06.280 --> 02:29:08.280
and maybe not the community as a whole,

02:29:08.280 --> 02:29:12.280
or rate the raters would be a great thing.

02:29:12.280 --> 02:29:13.280
Rate the raters.

02:29:13.280 --> 02:29:15.280
That's something they need to bring to iTunes,

02:29:15.280 --> 02:29:16.280
is rating the raters.

02:29:16.280 --> 02:29:18.280
And you kind of can too a little bit.

02:29:18.280 --> 02:29:20.280
You can say, was this comment helpful?

02:29:20.280 --> 02:29:21.280
Yes or no.

02:29:21.280 --> 02:29:24.280
But it really doesn't have any bearing on the author as a whole.

02:29:24.280 --> 02:29:26.280
I think that's something I would like to see,

02:29:26.280 --> 02:29:28.280
is you rate the rater.

02:29:28.280 --> 02:29:30.280
And as the rater's rating goes up,

02:29:30.280 --> 02:29:32.280
their rating carries more weight.

02:29:32.280 --> 02:29:34.280
And as it goes down, it loses weight.

02:29:34.280 --> 02:29:36.280
That's what I'd like to see.

02:29:36.280 --> 02:29:38.280
That was a lot of uses of the word rate.

02:29:38.280 --> 02:29:40.280
Only in the perfect world.

02:29:40.280 --> 02:29:41.280
Yeah.

02:29:41.280 --> 02:29:42.280
But I don't know.

02:29:42.280 --> 02:29:45.280
I kind of think that's the way to do it.

02:29:45.280 --> 02:29:48.280
But yeah, that one indie game you were talking about

02:29:48.280 --> 02:29:50.280
earlier in the show, Attack, or what was it?

02:29:50.280 --> 02:29:51.280
Barry Attack?

02:29:51.280 --> 02:29:52.280
It was Angry Barry.

02:29:52.280 --> 02:29:53.280
Angry Barry.

02:29:53.280 --> 02:29:55.280
And you know where I saw that.

02:29:55.280 --> 02:29:57.280
And I hate to say this, but IGN, actually,

02:29:57.280 --> 02:30:01.280
they do a segment that's a community shower,

02:30:01.280 --> 02:30:02.280
I think is what they call it.

02:30:02.280 --> 02:30:05.280
And basically they cover, you know,

02:30:05.280 --> 02:30:07.280
the last week of community games that came out,

02:30:07.280 --> 02:30:09.280
and the ones that they like and the ones they don't like.

02:30:09.280 --> 02:30:11.280
And that one had a video for it.

02:30:11.280 --> 02:30:14.280
They actually shot a little video for Angry Barry, I think.

02:30:14.280 --> 02:30:15.280
I don't know if they shot it,

02:30:15.280 --> 02:30:17.280
or if they just got a trailer from the website

02:30:17.280 --> 02:30:19.280
or something like that, but that's what it was from.

02:30:19.280 --> 02:30:22.280
And then I went all exciting, you know, and downloaded it,

02:30:22.280 --> 02:30:24.280
only to find out that it's broken.

02:30:24.280 --> 02:30:26.280
So that sucked.

02:30:26.280 --> 02:30:28.280
Marin in chat brings up a good point.

02:30:28.280 --> 02:30:30.280
He says, but what if somebody doesn't agree with the rating person,

02:30:30.280 --> 02:30:33.280
and so they rate the person lowly based on their opinion,

02:30:33.280 --> 02:30:34.280
not their review rating?

02:30:34.280 --> 02:30:35.280
That's a fair argument.

02:30:35.280 --> 02:30:37.280
I mean, I guess it's...

02:30:37.280 --> 02:30:39.280
The system, it's going to basically,

02:30:39.280 --> 02:30:40.280
what it's going to come down to is,

02:30:40.280 --> 02:30:42.280
yeah, there's going to be people that are going to do that,

02:30:42.280 --> 02:30:44.280
and, you know, rally their friends,

02:30:44.280 --> 02:30:46.280
but in the end it all equals out,

02:30:46.280 --> 02:30:49.280
because there's a lot more people not involved with them

02:30:49.280 --> 02:30:51.280
that, you know, aren't going to be rating and stuff.

02:30:51.280 --> 02:30:54.280
So that it'll be just a slight fluctuation,

02:30:54.280 --> 02:30:56.280
and that's really kind of,

02:30:56.280 --> 02:30:58.280
you've got to account for that kind of error in there.

02:30:58.280 --> 02:31:00.280
Well, I hope you're right,

02:31:00.280 --> 02:31:02.280
and we can all hear you eating over there.

02:31:02.280 --> 02:31:04.280
I just hit the mic with my plate.

02:31:04.280 --> 02:31:07.280
Also, Kay Levster says,

02:31:07.280 --> 02:31:09.280
I think it will sort itself out.

02:31:09.280 --> 02:31:12.280
The Xbox Live community is far more liquid than Dig.

02:31:12.280 --> 02:31:13.280
I don't know, though.

02:31:13.280 --> 02:31:15.280
There's some real, like, come on.

02:31:15.280 --> 02:31:16.280
You've played Halo Online.

02:31:16.280 --> 02:31:17.280
I don't know if you have,

02:31:17.280 --> 02:31:19.280
but a lot of you have played, like, Halo Online.

02:31:19.280 --> 02:31:22.280
There are some people who play those games online.

02:31:22.280 --> 02:31:24.280
I don't want to hear their opinions.

02:31:24.280 --> 02:31:26.280
I don't want to hear what they have to say.

02:31:26.280 --> 02:31:27.280
You know what I mean?

02:31:27.280 --> 02:31:30.280
These people that get on there and say n-word, n-word, f-word, f-word.

02:31:30.280 --> 02:31:32.280
You know who I'm talking about.

02:31:32.280 --> 02:31:34.280
Like, is there a way I could just, like, block out their ratings?

02:31:34.280 --> 02:31:37.280
If I block them on Xbox Live, will it block their ratings out too?

02:31:37.280 --> 02:31:39.280
I do think it would be really smart,

02:31:39.280 --> 02:31:42.280
and it would also, once again, go back to tying in.

02:31:42.280 --> 02:31:45.280
Because you can do, like, with your Xbox Live arcade games,

02:31:45.280 --> 02:31:49.280
you can see where you rank, like, in the leaderboards versus the world

02:31:49.280 --> 02:31:51.280
versus, you know, your friends.

02:31:51.280 --> 02:31:54.280
And I think their reviews should also be the same way.

02:31:54.280 --> 02:31:55.280
If your friends have reviewed that,

02:31:55.280 --> 02:31:57.280
you should be able to see their reviews,

02:31:57.280 --> 02:31:59.280
or you can just see the community as a whole.

02:31:59.280 --> 02:32:00.280
Ooh, like Netflix.

02:32:00.280 --> 02:32:02.280
Netflix, perfect. Perfect model.

02:32:02.280 --> 02:32:04.280
And Xbox has it in with Netflix anyway.

02:32:04.280 --> 02:32:05.280
There you go.

02:32:05.280 --> 02:32:06.280
There you go.

02:32:06.280 --> 02:32:07.280
Steal from Netflix.

02:32:07.280 --> 02:32:08.280
There's the answer.

02:32:08.280 --> 02:32:10.280
Great.

02:32:10.280 --> 02:32:11.280
All right.

02:32:11.280 --> 02:32:14.280
Well, I want to move on to another story,

02:32:14.280 --> 02:32:15.280
and it has to do with Microsoft.

02:32:15.280 --> 02:32:16.280
A whole lot of Microsoft tonight.

02:32:16.280 --> 02:32:20.280
But Project Natal, going back to that, talking about,

02:32:20.280 --> 02:32:22.280
we were talking about it a little bit during Part A,

02:32:22.280 --> 02:32:25.280
but it's made its mainstream television debut.

02:32:25.280 --> 02:32:26.280
That's right.

02:32:26.280 --> 02:32:29.280
It showed up on Late Night with Jimmy Fallon.

02:32:29.280 --> 02:32:31.280
It showed up a little earlier this week.

02:32:31.280 --> 02:32:34.280
Oop, I'm bringing up the actual Hulu thing here in studio,

02:32:34.280 --> 02:32:35.280
although they're going to do a commercial here,

02:32:35.280 --> 02:32:36.280
so I'm going to mute it for that,

02:32:36.280 --> 02:32:38.280
because if the commercial people aren't going to pay us,

02:32:38.280 --> 02:32:40.280
I'm not going to rebroadcast that.

02:32:40.280 --> 02:32:45.280
But I do want to show a little bit about the whole Jimmy Fallon late night thing.

02:32:45.280 --> 02:32:48.280
They actually showed Natal on it, and I don't know why,

02:32:48.280 --> 02:32:50.280
but they all were wearing these red jumpsuits and things

02:32:50.280 --> 02:32:51.280
when they were demoing it.

02:32:51.280 --> 02:32:55.280
But certainly it was interesting, if nothing else,

02:32:55.280 --> 02:33:01.280
to actually see this being played by somebody who wasn't a Microsoft spokesperson.

02:33:01.280 --> 02:33:02.280
You know what I mean?

02:33:02.280 --> 02:33:05.280
It was a real person at least checking this out.

02:33:05.280 --> 02:33:09.280
All right, let's actually see if we can check this out just a little bit here.

02:33:09.280 --> 02:33:11.280
It's a bunch of red shirts. Kill them.

02:33:11.280 --> 02:33:14.280
I'm going to actually forward ahead a little bit here in the video

02:33:14.280 --> 02:33:16.280
so we can actually see where they're playing.

02:33:16.280 --> 02:33:17.280
My avatar walks with me.

02:33:17.280 --> 02:33:20.280
How much room can you put this one in your dorm room?

02:33:20.280 --> 02:33:21.280
Oh, totally.

02:33:21.280 --> 02:33:23.280
We'll be able to fit it into all types of different living spaces

02:33:23.280 --> 02:33:25.280
so anybody can get in and play it.

02:33:25.280 --> 02:33:27.280
Now this is going to work with all Xbox 360s.

02:33:27.280 --> 02:33:29.280
People already have any one that's bought in the future.

02:33:29.280 --> 02:33:30.280
It all just works.

02:33:30.280 --> 02:33:31.280
I want this now.

02:33:31.280 --> 02:33:32.280
Excellent.

02:33:32.280 --> 02:33:34.280
Well, I'm sure we can work out a deal for you.

02:33:34.280 --> 02:33:35.280
Jimmy Fallon, you're not funny.

02:33:35.280 --> 02:33:36.280
Still.

02:33:36.280 --> 02:33:37.280
I'm going to do a little quick demo.

02:33:37.280 --> 02:33:40.280
I'm going to forward a little ahead to where they're actually playing.

02:33:40.280 --> 02:33:42.280
Come on.

02:33:42.280 --> 02:33:44.280
You can see where the shadow is there.

02:33:44.280 --> 02:33:46.280
It's like a 3D little breakout game.

02:33:46.280 --> 02:33:48.280
This is one of the games they were showing actually

02:33:48.280 --> 02:33:50.280
at E3 as one of the demos.

02:33:50.280 --> 02:33:51.280
It's kind of cool.

02:33:51.280 --> 02:33:53.280
Let me turn this down a little bit.

02:33:53.280 --> 02:33:56.280
Yeah, it looks like fun to flail around like a fool for a little while,

02:33:56.280 --> 02:33:58.280
but I don't know for how long.

02:33:58.280 --> 02:34:00.280
Again, I don't think there's an actual game here,

02:34:00.280 --> 02:34:03.280
but if this is a minigame in a much larger game,

02:34:03.280 --> 02:34:04.280
I think this could be cool.

02:34:04.280 --> 02:34:07.280
You're doing it like volleyball.

02:34:07.280 --> 02:34:10.280
Yeah, I mean, the game, you know,

02:34:10.280 --> 02:34:12.280
it looks like it might be fun for a little while.

02:34:12.280 --> 02:34:14.280
I don't know about the longevity of it,

02:34:14.280 --> 02:34:15.280
but a lot of weak games.

02:34:15.280 --> 02:34:16.280
I think this is a demo.

02:34:16.280 --> 02:34:17.280
This is a demo, though.

02:34:17.280 --> 02:34:19.280
Yeah, but, okay, yeah.

02:34:19.280 --> 02:34:20.280
To be fair, it's a tech demo.

02:34:20.280 --> 02:34:21.280
No, like, games.

02:34:21.280 --> 02:34:22.280
So was Wii Sports and Wii Play.

02:34:22.280 --> 02:34:25.280
So a lot of the things you saw in Wii Play were tech demos, too.

02:34:25.280 --> 02:34:28.280
I think this will come out if nothing else is an Xbox Live arcade game.

02:34:28.280 --> 02:34:29.280
You'll see this.

02:34:29.280 --> 02:34:31.280
They'll make a game out of this somehow.

02:34:31.280 --> 02:34:32.280
But...

02:34:32.280 --> 02:34:34.280
I think that there...

02:34:34.280 --> 02:34:38.280
I honestly, though, see a whole lot of potential for this technology, though.

02:34:38.280 --> 02:34:40.280
There really is.

02:34:40.280 --> 02:34:45.280
Honestly, I'm not ready to pass judgment on it yet.

02:34:45.280 --> 02:34:46.280
Really, I'm not.

02:34:46.280 --> 02:34:48.280
sj100map makes a correction to something I was saying.

02:34:48.280 --> 02:34:51.280
Correction, Rob, that was the only demo they did on stage, I believe.

02:34:51.280 --> 02:34:52.280
That's a good point.

02:34:52.280 --> 02:34:54.280
When they did that whole Milo thing, that was a pre-taped video.

02:34:54.280 --> 02:34:56.280
But they did a demo on stage, though.

02:34:56.280 --> 02:35:00.280
They did that exact same game on stage with Project Natal at the press conference.

02:35:00.280 --> 02:35:01.280
Got it.

02:35:01.280 --> 02:35:04.280
So this is like their touring game that they have to show at the stuff.

02:35:04.280 --> 02:35:06.280
But still, the nice thing about it was,

02:35:06.280 --> 02:35:09.280
it was, you know, say what you want to about Jimmy Fallon

02:35:09.280 --> 02:35:11.280
and his humor or lack thereof.

02:35:11.280 --> 02:35:14.280
He's not somebody in the game industry.

02:35:14.280 --> 02:35:17.280
He's like a quote-unquote real person now demoing this.

02:35:17.280 --> 02:35:19.280
So you know it wasn't rigged.

02:35:19.280 --> 02:35:20.280
Does that make sense?

02:35:20.280 --> 02:35:21.280
Yes.

02:35:21.280 --> 02:35:24.280
You know, everything that happened was, you know, like a real thing.

02:35:24.280 --> 02:35:29.280
So now I feel like this is really the first time we're really getting to see this in action.

02:35:29.280 --> 02:35:31.280
Because Natal was hidden on the show floor.

02:35:31.280 --> 02:35:34.280
And they weren't letting regular people play it.

02:35:34.280 --> 02:35:36.280
Like, this was a huge step in actually seeing this.

02:35:36.280 --> 02:35:38.280
By the way, sorry to get off track here,

02:35:38.280 --> 02:35:42.280
but what is up with Jimmy Fallon, like, kind of like tapping into the game industry lately?

02:35:42.280 --> 02:35:47.280
Well, that's what he says. His thing was that he wants to treat game releases like movie releases.

02:35:47.280 --> 02:35:50.280
Like, he's a big gamer, I guess.

02:35:50.280 --> 02:35:54.280
And apparently he's going to start doing more content like this.

02:35:54.280 --> 02:35:56.280
Is that maybe because of his audience?

02:35:56.280 --> 02:35:59.280
Because, you know, who stays up to watch Late Night College Kids?

02:35:59.280 --> 02:36:02.280
Maybe he's trying to tap a new audience because, you know,

02:36:02.280 --> 02:36:05.280
a lot of the audience that was fans of Conan moved to Conan.

02:36:05.280 --> 02:36:09.280
And also maybe he realizes he's not that funny.

02:36:09.280 --> 02:36:11.280
So, you know, stick with what you know.

02:36:11.280 --> 02:36:16.280
Well, to be fair, you know what, to be fair, Conan had a real rough first six months.

02:36:16.280 --> 02:36:18.280
You know, a lot of people wrote him off when the show first started.

02:36:18.280 --> 02:36:20.280
He didn't find his niche for a year.

02:36:20.280 --> 02:36:22.280
So I'm willing to give Jimmy Fallon a year. Whatever.

02:36:22.280 --> 02:36:27.280
But all that aside, you know, he has been, you know, pretty decent, I guess, about coverage.

02:36:27.280 --> 02:36:34.280
I feel like I'm getting more gaming coverage watching Jimmy Fallon than I am most times I'm watching G4, E3 Accepted.

02:36:34.280 --> 02:36:35.280
You know what I mean?

02:36:35.280 --> 02:36:36.280
Yeah.

02:36:36.280 --> 02:36:40.280
They had Jason Sudeikis or whatever his name is kind of around at E3.

02:36:40.280 --> 02:36:46.280
That's kind of funny. I like the little video they did for that.

02:36:46.280 --> 02:36:49.280
Yeah, Kay Levster in chat makes a funny comment.

02:36:49.280 --> 02:36:53.280
He wants to get his games for free, thus now he's scared.

02:36:53.280 --> 02:36:56.280
Tigerclaw says Jimmy Fallon is a bit of a tech geek.

02:36:56.280 --> 02:36:59.280
He had the guys from Dignation on the show before.

02:36:59.280 --> 02:37:02.280
He's living up to his promising of promoting video games.

02:37:02.280 --> 02:37:07.280
Well, I'm glad somebody is.

02:37:07.280 --> 02:37:15.280
Alright, well, regardless, it was kind of nice to see Natal actually kind of making a show on a big, you know, well, I don't know if you want to say big,

02:37:15.280 --> 02:37:24.280
but a fair show that has at least a million people watching it and getting, you know, a live real person who doesn't work for the company playing it.

02:37:24.280 --> 02:37:25.280
Hmm.

02:37:25.280 --> 02:37:29.280
No, it kind of changed topics a little bit.

02:37:29.280 --> 02:37:36.280
Apparently, Alexey Pajitnov, the creator of Tetris.

02:37:36.280 --> 02:37:42.280
Of course, you know, Tetris just had its 25th anniversary not too long ago.

02:37:42.280 --> 02:37:52.280
Apparently, he's saying that he wants, well, it's, you know, so huge right now with, you know, with like 125 million copies sold.

02:37:52.280 --> 02:37:58.280
And, you know, probably one of the, I think one of the biggest, most recognized games out there.

02:37:58.280 --> 02:38:03.280
He's saying they could see probably an evolution of Tetris becoming a sport.

02:38:03.280 --> 02:38:09.280
Of course, the future is that a country that has 48 million people living in it,

02:38:09.280 --> 02:38:14.280
and the biggest casual gaming site in the country has 24 million registered users.

02:38:14.280 --> 02:38:15.280
That country is Korea.

02:38:15.280 --> 02:38:18.280
That's what's going to happen in the rest of the world.

02:38:18.280 --> 02:38:25.280
So kind of like, you know, everybody competing in this first virtual sport.

02:38:25.280 --> 02:38:32.280
Sports like baseball and football were created at a time when their future was a lifetime of physical activities and physical fitness.

02:38:32.280 --> 02:38:34.280
But now that's not as important.

02:38:34.280 --> 02:38:37.280
It's more about mental fitness today.

02:38:37.280 --> 02:38:40.280
And Tetris is a virtual sport that exercises the mind.

02:38:40.280 --> 02:38:45.280
That's the definition of a virtual sport.

02:38:45.280 --> 02:38:50.280
So how exactly would, I guess I'm not getting it, how exactly, where would the sport be in this?

02:38:50.280 --> 02:38:51.280
Competing one-on-one.

02:38:51.280 --> 02:38:56.280
It's just, you know, a bunch of people in a Tetris tournament.

02:38:56.280 --> 02:38:58.280
The end.

02:38:58.280 --> 02:38:59.280
Hmm.

02:38:59.280 --> 02:39:05.280
Interesting, though, that it seems like we always have this video games as a sport discussion comes up once in a while.

02:39:05.280 --> 02:39:06.280
Remember when they wanted to make DDR a sport?

02:39:06.280 --> 02:39:08.280
Or they did in a couple of countries.

02:39:08.280 --> 02:39:09.280
I know, but here's the thing.

02:39:09.280 --> 02:39:14.280
I think we're looking at it, when we say sports, we think physical sports.

02:39:14.280 --> 02:39:17.280
And he's trying to say that there's other sports out there, like chess.

02:39:17.280 --> 02:39:19.280
Chess is not a physical sport.

02:39:19.280 --> 02:39:21.280
I mean, you play it physically, but it's more mental.

02:39:21.280 --> 02:39:23.280
Is chess at the Olympics?

02:39:23.280 --> 02:39:25.280
I don't think so.

02:39:25.280 --> 02:39:26.280
I don't know.

02:39:26.280 --> 02:39:27.280
That's a very good question.

02:39:27.280 --> 02:39:29.280
I wonder if one of our chatters knows.

02:39:29.280 --> 02:39:31.280
Is chess an Olympic sport?

02:39:31.280 --> 02:39:32.280
I don't think it is.

02:39:32.280 --> 02:39:33.280
Hmm.

02:39:33.280 --> 02:39:34.280
But like, you know, stuff like that.

02:39:34.280 --> 02:39:41.280
You know, nowadays, you know, with a lot of gamers out there now, they have, you know, the, you know, championship gaming stuff that they do,

02:39:41.280 --> 02:39:48.280
which making, you know, people into actual teams and stuff like that and promoting them like a football team and stuff.

02:39:48.280 --> 02:39:51.280
That's cool and all, but I don't know.

02:39:51.280 --> 02:39:53.280
That's not really the model I see.

02:39:53.280 --> 02:39:55.280
Three no's in chat, by the way.

02:39:55.280 --> 02:39:57.280
Chess is not an Olympic sport.

02:39:57.280 --> 02:40:04.280
And, in fact, I even Googled it, and there was an article in Time Magazine, August 5th of 2008, chess and bridge enthusiasts,

02:40:04.280 --> 02:40:08.280
they are lobbying the International Olympic Committee to allow their games.

02:40:08.280 --> 02:40:09.280
I don't think that they should be.

02:40:09.280 --> 02:40:13.280
I mean, the Olympics is a physical sports competition.

02:40:13.280 --> 02:40:15.280
It shouldn't be.

02:40:15.280 --> 02:40:19.280
You know, DDR shouldn't be really a sport.

02:40:19.280 --> 02:40:22.280
I mean, you play it physically, but it's not...

02:40:22.280 --> 02:40:31.280
Oh, DDR is hard to compete in anyways. It's basically about accuracy and, you know, as far as a way to actually grade it and freestyle and stuff.

02:40:31.280 --> 02:40:34.280
It's kind of stupid because that's just interpretive dance, so I don't know.

02:40:34.280 --> 02:40:36.280
Well, but they have interpretive dance in the Olympics.

02:40:36.280 --> 02:40:41.280
Yeah, and why do you need DDR? I would think it'd be retarded, and it would only give Konami more reasons.

02:40:41.280 --> 02:40:47.280
DDR is more of a... Oh, God, not to get down on this, but in its heyday, DDR would have been better suited for something like the X Games,

02:40:47.280 --> 02:40:51.280
or something, you know, like an ESPN2 Olympics, you know what I mean?

02:40:51.280 --> 02:40:53.280
ESPN8, the Ocho.

02:40:53.280 --> 02:40:55.280
Exactly, the Ocho Olympics.

02:40:55.280 --> 02:40:59.280
So why shouldn't Tetris be on... Did you ever see the movie Dodgeball?

02:40:59.280 --> 02:41:00.280
No.

02:41:00.280 --> 02:41:02.280
Because Jamie's giving us this look of, like, what the hell are you guys saying?

02:41:02.280 --> 02:41:03.280
That's the joke.

02:41:03.280 --> 02:41:05.280
I want to know what planet you're from.

02:41:05.280 --> 02:41:07.280
Alright, anyway.

02:41:07.280 --> 02:41:11.280
What else? Ah, now I lost my train of thought. Choo-choo, derailed.

02:41:13.280 --> 02:41:17.280
Is this the type of thing that he thinks should be televised, or what?

02:41:17.280 --> 02:41:18.280
I guess we don't know, but...

02:41:18.280 --> 02:41:23.280
I don't know. I mean, this is just him making a comment, and bloggers picking up on it, like, going,

02:41:23.280 --> 02:41:25.280
Oh my God, he thinks it should be a sport!

02:41:25.280 --> 02:41:33.280
Well, if it, let's say it was the type of sport that you would see on the Ocho, or, you know, in all reality, ESPN2 or something like that, would you watch it?

02:41:33.280 --> 02:41:34.280
Nope.

02:41:34.280 --> 02:41:47.280
I'm curious, chatters, if Tetris was a sport, and they broadcast the big, uh, the big showdowns live on ESPN or ESPN2 or ABC Wild World of Sports, would you watch it?

02:41:47.280 --> 02:41:50.280
I guess this all goes into competitive gaming.

02:41:50.280 --> 02:41:51.280
Human Tetris.

02:41:51.280 --> 02:41:57.280
They, well, they did make a show out of that, aren't they? Isn't that going to be a show on Fox or something?

02:41:57.280 --> 02:41:59.280
It is already. Yeah, it's The Wall.

02:41:59.280 --> 02:42:04.280
It was like, they did it as a gag on Ellen, like, five minutes a week or something.

02:42:04.280 --> 02:42:10.280
Well, it was in Japan. It's an actual show in Japan, and they do it for fun there, but, you know, we have to do it for prizes.

02:42:10.280 --> 02:42:13.280
No such thing as fun and game shows.

02:42:13.280 --> 02:42:21.280
Osfer in chat says, I go to Ohio tournaments often, and I can say that DDR is definitely competitive enough to be an Olympic sport.

02:42:21.280 --> 02:42:23.280
Chat.orangelandradio.com.

02:42:23.280 --> 02:42:27.280
Kay Levster says, watching Tetris is like watching golf, so, no.

02:42:27.280 --> 02:42:29.280
There's a whole channel dedicated to golf, though, mind you.

02:42:29.280 --> 02:42:30.280
Exactly.

02:42:30.280 --> 02:42:31.280
A whole channel.

02:42:31.280 --> 02:42:39.280
It would, it just wouldn't be something that, I mean, it's hard to make it interesting, I guess.

02:42:39.280 --> 02:42:43.280
If you're going to say no to that, though, what about competitive gaming on TV?

02:42:43.280 --> 02:42:45.280
Should we just not have competitive gaming on TV, then?

02:42:45.280 --> 02:42:52.280
Like the, you know, Counter-Strike tournaments and, you know, whatever the first person shooter hit of the week happens to be that they're playing online?

02:42:52.280 --> 02:42:54.280
Should they not be televised, either?

02:42:54.280 --> 02:43:00.280
No, I don't think it's an issue of them being televised at all. It's just a way of how we're able to capture it and film it.

02:43:00.280 --> 02:43:06.280
Sports, that's easy to televise because you can, you know, usually all the gameplay and stuff is going on in one area.

02:43:06.280 --> 02:43:09.280
You can, you know, zoom back to catch the whole field and stuff like that.

02:43:09.280 --> 02:43:12.280
Like, doing Counter-Strike, you can't really film that.

02:43:12.280 --> 02:43:17.280
There's no way that you can see everything that's going on all at once because of the nature of the game it is.

02:43:17.280 --> 02:43:20.280
You have to kind of focus on the different players and stuff.

02:43:20.280 --> 02:43:30.280
I guess, I don't know, it's, you know, NASCAR, you can kind of do that kind of stuff where you can film the whole pack of cars and stuff, but they do like the in-car camps and that kind of thing.

02:43:30.280 --> 02:43:39.280
But, it's just hard to film it and make it interesting in the same way as like a football game or a baseball game or something like that.

02:43:39.280 --> 02:43:46.280
Where they've been doing it for years and they've figured out, you know, they have commentators and know what they're talking about and stuff like that.

02:43:46.280 --> 02:43:55.280
It's like, you know, if you started filming Counter-Strike or something like that and you started talking about it, you know, and you had, you know, commentators going,

02:43:55.280 --> 02:43:59.240
this person so I don't know who these people are I'm aware that counter-strike

02:43:59.240 --> 02:44:03.600
exists and what it basically is but I don't know who any of these players are

02:44:03.600 --> 02:44:08.480
and this wouldn't really be interesting to me I don't know it's it's just it's

02:44:08.480 --> 02:44:15.320
really tough to broadcast and you're not going to get the same responses like the

02:44:15.320 --> 02:44:21.160
NFL or something the Rob D in chat makes comment that see this is the problem

02:44:21.160 --> 02:44:24.640
competitive gaming how many different things can happen in football you might

02:44:24.640 --> 02:44:28.320
see something that you've never seen before every week in DDR the

02:44:28.320 --> 02:44:31.060
participants aren't even interacting it's a matter of seeing who scores the

02:44:31.060 --> 02:44:34.360
most I think it would take a lot more animations and reactions to make it more

02:44:34.360 --> 02:44:37.860
it is hard to like with a fighting game or something like that I think the

02:44:37.860 --> 02:44:42.020
fighting game would be the easiest thing to film because it's all one screen you

02:44:42.020 --> 02:44:46.880
can see all the action all at once you know but the problem is it's moving so

02:44:46.880 --> 02:44:52.320
fast it's hard to commentate on that you can't really commentate where there's

02:44:52.320 --> 02:44:56.800
baseball there's a punch in there oh my gosh I do get no my gosh it is a super

02:44:56.800 --> 02:45:01.400
combo attack on the kind of you know it was baseball and football there's a lot

02:45:01.400 --> 02:45:05.320
of you know different you know pauses in the game where you can catch up the

02:45:05.320 --> 02:45:09.120
speeds the instant replays that kind of stuff they've figured out of filling you

02:45:09.120 --> 02:45:15.400
know the gaps but it's just it's too difficult to film this like it like a

02:45:15.400 --> 02:45:19.280
sport I think a little bit of back and forth going on ospher says it's still

02:45:19.280 --> 02:45:23.240
competing whoever can get the highest score on max unlimited isn't really that

02:45:23.240 --> 02:45:29.520
different than who can get the best time on a 100 meter dash hmm also a lot of

02:45:29.520 --> 02:45:33.160
talk about that old show arena on g4 a lot of fans of that show in our chat

02:45:33.160 --> 02:45:36.600
room right now I wasn't that big on arena you know why because it was so

02:45:36.600 --> 02:45:40.120
heavily edited you were only really seeing the highlights of every match and

02:45:40.120 --> 02:45:42.760
I don't know like I felt like I didn't learn enough about the game and the

02:45:42.760 --> 02:45:47.240
actual strategy and how to get better from just seeing and it was so fast the

02:45:47.240 --> 02:45:50.240
way they went back and forth from all the different piece I didn't never felt

02:45:50.240 --> 02:45:54.040
like I really understood what was going on watching that show maybe it's just

02:45:54.040 --> 02:45:56.920
because I'm not into first-person shooters as much as I am other games but

02:45:56.920 --> 02:46:00.760
that was my problem see they could do like something I'm I don't even know if

02:46:00.760 --> 02:46:04.360
a game exists out there like that would like Call of Duty 4 actually this be

02:46:04.360 --> 02:46:08.560
more like operation of flashpoint 2 I think because it's more open-world but

02:46:08.560 --> 02:46:11.320
like you could do something where you have two different teams you can show

02:46:11.320 --> 02:46:15.920
them strategizing you you know about the game beforehand you know planning out

02:46:15.920 --> 02:46:18.640
stuff they could talk about the different possibilities how they may be

02:46:18.640 --> 02:46:22.320
able to like okay your team you know the red team right here can you know go down

02:46:22.320 --> 02:46:25.800
flank under this you know through this valley or something like that you know

02:46:25.800 --> 02:46:29.120
but then they have to watch out so there's a lot of commentary in like

02:46:29.120 --> 02:46:34.760
visual aids that they could do there but it's just it's really tough once again

02:46:34.760 --> 02:46:39.440
and I am pretty much stresses almost every sentence now it's really tough to

02:46:39.440 --> 02:46:45.320
film this stuff to make it interesting you just I don't know it's unless it's

02:46:45.320 --> 02:46:49.320
like you know a NASCAR game or like Project Gotham would kind of work

02:46:49.320 --> 02:46:53.040
because they had the spectator mode where you can actually watch the cars

02:46:53.040 --> 02:46:57.680
and stuff racing around almost like as you were you know watching a you know

02:46:57.680 --> 02:47:01.920
television production of you know race so you could do something similar like

02:47:01.920 --> 02:47:05.720
that and that might work as far as commentary and stuff goes you know maybe

02:47:05.720 --> 02:47:12.400
like a Ridge Racer would be kind of interesting but you know it really it's

02:47:12.400 --> 02:47:17.960
only specific types of games and I don't know first-person shooters are really

02:47:17.960 --> 02:47:22.320
going to work because it's so massive and there's so much stuff going on SSJ

02:47:22.320 --> 02:47:25.040
100 Matt says this and we're going to move on try to get towards the end of

02:47:25.040 --> 02:47:29.200
the show here the fact is statistics and ratings show people don't really care

02:47:29.200 --> 02:47:33.600
for watching people playing video games yet Starcraft televised competitions

02:47:33.600 --> 02:47:39.760
works in Korea Tiger Claw in chat says the problem was showing live gameplay of

02:47:39.760 --> 02:47:43.520
attorney is the action can get very repetitive and the average viewer will

02:47:43.520 --> 02:47:47.020
get bored by it Wallace gamers are used to seeing the repetitiveness of the

02:47:47.020 --> 02:47:50.000
games all right we're going to leave it there if you have further comments you

02:47:50.000 --> 02:47:53.480
can always send us an email mailbag orange lounge radio.com but we want to

02:47:53.480 --> 02:47:57.840
get to the F use of the week and of course something has to inspire the F use

02:47:57.840 --> 02:48:02.880
of the week what better than a stupid gamer doing something stupid it was a

02:48:02.880 --> 02:48:08.720
brotherly argument over video games it was an 11 year old Mississippi kid

02:48:08.720 --> 02:48:13.800
shooting a nine-year-old brother in the chest with a shotgun according to

02:48:13.800 --> 02:48:17.640
Sheriff Kenny Dickerson from Mark Marshall County the younger brother

02:48:17.640 --> 02:48:23.080
allegedly got mad because he beat got beat at some video games and got the gun

02:48:23.080 --> 02:48:26.920
the older brother said the weapon automatically went off when the two

02:48:26.920 --> 02:48:35.880
fought over it so yeah by the way they're saying that is unlikely the kid

02:48:35.880 --> 02:48:40.480
will be charged because he is under 13 years old and the entire incident

02:48:40.480 --> 02:48:46.680
appeared to be an accident anyway that's the part that disturbs me a lot like a

02:48:46.680 --> 02:48:55.840
lot like I realize he's a child but oh my god like not a mention of the parents

02:48:55.840 --> 02:48:59.600
and like what parent keeps a shotgun accessible to their 11 year old and

02:48:59.600 --> 02:49:05.520
obviously not you know a good one oh this just gives gamers everywhere a bad

02:49:05.520 --> 02:49:09.000
name to I hate it when stories like this are picked up by video game blogs too

02:49:09.000 --> 02:49:11.800
because it's just kind of like this really didn't have anything to do with

02:49:11.800 --> 02:49:15.440
video games yeah they fought over video games but you'll maybe not so much the

02:49:15.440 --> 02:49:18.120
gamer blogs I hate it when the mainstream media picks up these stories

02:49:18.120 --> 02:49:21.720
because it makes gamers look violent when this really has nothing to do with

02:49:21.720 --> 02:49:27.080
the video games this has everything to do with just blatant stupidity and bad

02:49:27.080 --> 02:49:35.000
bad bad terrible pain or parenting hmm so with that the F use of the week

02:49:35.000 --> 02:49:53.160
Oh dark soccer would you care to start us off with a rant of your own tonight

02:49:53.160 --> 02:50:02.960
if you do not let shit go Loki f you to moving especially my cat which it's not

02:50:02.960 --> 02:50:06.880
really her fault but she can't sleep right now because she's worried and

02:50:06.880 --> 02:50:11.400
doesn't know what's going on cats having trouble adjusting to places so she kept

02:50:11.400 --> 02:50:16.000
this up all night Oh and F you to myself for accidentally breaking the water line

02:50:16.000 --> 02:50:22.720
going to my fridge causing it to drip but in defense I think it's broken

02:50:22.720 --> 02:50:28.320
before I messed with it anyway so but cost me $175 have a plumber come out

02:50:28.320 --> 02:50:34.800
this morning fix it after you to people that you thought were great friends that

02:50:34.800 --> 02:50:39.600
seemed to disappear off the face of the planet altogether you know it just kind

02:50:39.600 --> 02:50:42.920
of sucks like to be felt like sometimes you're being dropped like a hot potato

02:50:42.920 --> 02:50:49.800
in I don't know for whatever reason so it's kind of stinks you know friends

02:50:49.800 --> 02:50:52.840
supposed to stick by each other through thick and thin sometimes I get the

02:50:52.840 --> 02:50:57.960
feeling that's not happening so F you to those general feelings of angst I hope

02:50:57.960 --> 02:51:06.680
I'm just I hope it's all in my head all right let's move on towards the end of

02:51:06.680 --> 02:51:10.400
the program here I think we're going to get into the rapid-fire news tonight so

02:51:10.400 --> 02:51:13.520
I'm just kind of going over some of the stories we didn't talk about more in

02:51:13.520 --> 02:51:16.960
depth but things you might want to know about anyway dark soccer you want to

02:53:52.720 --> 02:53:59.600
the game mirrors edge to big duh so no surprise are working on you know a sequel

02:53:59.600 --> 02:54:06.400
to a successful hopefully it's just a successful franchise for them and then

02:54:06.400 --> 02:54:14.880
lastly the secret is out the PlayStation home alternate reality game X I or Z or

02:54:14.880 --> 02:54:19.760
however the hell you pronounce it it's over it's done you can find out about

02:54:19.760 --> 02:54:24.360
all the information that was behind it they will be running the game I guess

02:54:24.360 --> 02:54:27.480
for a little longer so if you are in the middle of the game you can actually

02:54:27.480 --> 02:54:31.160
finish it but if you don't care to wait for that I think the PlayStation blog

02:54:31.160 --> 02:54:37.360
has all the information as far as what's going on there so check it out if you

02:54:37.360 --> 02:54:38.360
want to spoil it

02:54:38.360 --> 02:54:46.120
alright well before we wrap up the show we are going to open up the sky plane

02:54:46.120 --> 02:54:49.760
take your calls but first we didn't get to the classic game of the week in part

02:54:49.760 --> 02:54:53.680
a we got to get that taken care of tonight it just wouldn't be a week here

02:54:53.680 --> 02:54:57.120
at orange long radio without the classic game of the week so every week dark

02:54:57.120 --> 02:55:00.320
soccer likes to dig through the great archive of gaming and pull out a game

02:55:00.320 --> 02:55:04.120
that you people ought to be playing it's the classic game of the week and here it

02:55:04.120 --> 02:55:05.120
is

02:55:05.120 --> 02:55:14.080
what should the kids be playing this week Donkey Kong jr. seriously it is

02:55:14.080 --> 02:55:18.480
seriously classic game it's one where Donkey Kong's little kid wearing a

02:55:18.480 --> 02:55:23.920
diaper has to go rescue Donkey Kong from Mario who has captured him and

02:55:23.920 --> 02:55:28.840
basically you just climb on ropes and drop fruit on these mechanized little

02:55:28.840 --> 02:55:34.480
big mouth trap thingy these and then you have you know an electrical stage in

02:55:34.480 --> 02:55:45.400
different areas it's actually supposed to be the the guy Steve Wiebe had the

02:55:45.400 --> 02:55:50.320
highest score on this one actually and he did pass Billy Mitchell on this so

02:55:50.320 --> 02:55:55.400
the untold story yeah I don't know that Billy Mitchell has surpassed it actually

02:55:55.400 --> 02:56:01.440
since then his score was one million thirty three thousand points and Steve

02:56:01.440 --> 02:56:06.040
Wiebe got one million one thousand thirty nine eight hundred points I have

02:56:06.040 --> 02:56:08.960
this on several systems like the NES there's actually a game and watch

02:56:08.960 --> 02:56:14.640
version the NES version was the launch title in Japan we have got it on a

02:56:14.640 --> 02:56:18.920
virtual console there was an e-reader card it was an Animal Crossing so yeah

02:56:18.920 --> 02:56:24.960
it's a pretty pretty classic this is one of the few Nintendo games I actually had

02:56:24.960 --> 02:56:28.440
there was a combo pack that came out on the NES back in the day that was like

02:56:28.440 --> 02:56:31.720
both Donkey Kong junior games and I had that actually I was one of the first

02:56:31.720 --> 02:56:38.760
Antonio games I had so that's cool I played this on the Coleco yeah it's old

02:56:38.760 --> 02:56:41.640
school you know what I actually kind of like this game better a little bit than

02:56:41.640 --> 02:56:44.200
Donkey Kong I don't know why I guess I just like the whole concept of the vine

02:56:44.200 --> 02:56:48.600
climbing and that you kind of go faster if you're willing to go across to be a

02:56:48.600 --> 02:56:54.000
really fast when you slide down it's interesting all right if nothing else to

02:56:54.000 --> 02:56:57.280
say on this game from Dark Soccer then that's gonna do it for your classic game

02:56:57.280 --> 02:57:02.400
of the week Donkey Kong jr. on just about every freaking system ever made

02:57:02.400 --> 02:57:07.760

02:57:46.200 --> 02:57:52.120
well if you've been following my Twitter blog I've been like not feeling it not

02:57:52.120 --> 02:57:56.760
feeling it cuz there's been delays guests canceling but when I got there

02:57:56.760 --> 02:58:01.240
and got to the groove of things it was fun and I really enjoyed myself this

02:58:01.240 --> 02:58:04.240
year I have to be honest I've kind of been off Twitter all weekend I've been

02:58:04.240 --> 02:58:08.440
so busy just running from place to place doing well it's nice again I can't you

02:58:08.440 --> 02:58:12.640
know I it's nice having a show at social life but yeah I've been so busy I've

02:58:12.640 --> 02:58:17.120
kind of been off Twitter but I can't understandable I know what you mean you

02:58:17.120 --> 02:58:20.800
know sometimes you're just kind of not in the mood but then you get there and

02:58:20.800 --> 02:58:23.720
it somehow all comes together like haven't you ever done that like there's

02:58:23.720 --> 02:58:27.280
been like a party and you don't really want to go but maybe there's like either

02:58:27.280 --> 02:58:31.200
a significant other or it's an important friend having the party or something you

02:58:31.200 --> 02:58:34.240
know yeah and you're just not feeling it but you're like alright I'm gonna go

02:58:34.240 --> 02:58:37.840
because I have to and maybe I'll stay for an hour then find an excuse to leave

02:58:37.840 --> 02:58:41.360
like I have severe diarrhea or something right but then you get there and you're

02:58:41.360 --> 02:58:44.400
like oh I'm actually having a good time it just kind of seems to all come

02:58:44.400 --> 02:58:50.880
together like that yep that's how it was yeah so all right well what about you

02:58:50.880 --> 02:58:53.720
know we're a gaming show so I always have to ask you how is the gaming

02:58:53.720 --> 02:58:59.080
representation at the con was it was there good stuff there yeah um first up

02:58:59.080 --> 02:59:04.600
they had a room just for rock band they had it projected onto a large wall which

02:59:04.600 --> 02:59:11.840
is about 60 feet walk like about 60 feet wide pretty much mm-hmm it was a dark

02:59:11.840 --> 02:59:16.160
room and I walked in everybody was singing living on a prayer was it is

02:59:16.160 --> 02:59:19.400
this rock band room something where like people just randomly walk in and watch

02:59:19.400 --> 02:59:23.600
people play rock band I mean is that yeah I mean you would wait your turn to

02:59:23.600 --> 02:59:26.320
play but at the same time there was chair so we could sit down and watch

02:59:26.320 --> 02:59:33.040
him play I bet you see a lot of great talent though yes definitely sort of

02:59:33.040 --> 02:59:38.840
like an anime idol something like that and also there was also a beta test for

02:59:38.840 --> 02:59:45.720
um DJ hero there oh really yeah really so wait so you actually have to play DJ

02:59:45.720 --> 02:59:53.680
hero yeah it's called beat mania 2dx but um bomb nice well hold on the Rama Rama

02:59:53.680 --> 02:59:58.680
I I said this in part a the games have nothing in common they really don't if

02:59:58.680 --> 03:00:02.800
you've got to make that comparison beat mania and scratch but beat mania DJ

03:00:02.800 --> 03:00:06.880
hero no it doesn't work it doesn't where they're get dick there today they're two

03:00:06.880 --> 03:00:10.840
games that happen to use a turntable they're so different but here's the

03:00:10.840 --> 03:00:15.440
thing though I wasn't the one that made the joke cuz I walked in I saw the sign

03:00:15.440 --> 03:00:20.280
I've run over to the other side the game room cuz I know when a guy is over I'm

03:00:20.280 --> 03:00:25.400
like what's up with DJ here it was like no it's 2dx dudes 2dx I'm like haha

03:00:25.400 --> 03:00:30.400
funny oh so they made the joke uh-huh well please encourage them to go listen

03:00:30.400 --> 03:00:34.280
to part a tonight cuz I'd have some pretty strong words for them I will I

03:00:34.280 --> 03:00:37.000
definitely will all right Rama I gotta let you go to get more calls but thanks

03:00:37.000 --> 03:00:40.640
so much for your call and have fun now on the anime circuit come in got it all

03:00:40.640 --> 03:00:46.280
right later let's see I'm looking at so because some of the chat rooms talking

03:00:46.280 --> 03:00:49.800
about anime next a little bit here legend Zaku says I mean X was pretty

03:00:49.800 --> 03:00:52.880
damn lackluster compared to previous years although the venue kicked ass this

03:00:52.880 --> 03:00:58.100
year Oscar says I can't wait until mid-july when I go to Otacon and Rob

03:00:58.100 --> 03:01:01.600
Diaz pimping his panel called games that push your buttons it is pretty funny

03:01:01.600 --> 03:01:04.680
though if you're going Otacon check that out hi Aaron orange launch radio who's

03:01:04.680 --> 03:01:09.200
this Zaku Zaku I was just reading a comment of yours is this call about

03:01:09.200 --> 03:01:14.660
anime next or what yeah I was there that weekend and I didn't room with Adam this

03:01:14.660 --> 03:01:19.200
year but I managed to find enough cash to go and split a room with someone else

03:01:19.200 --> 03:01:23.960
even though it wasn't far it was no wasn't far from the venue but I still

03:01:23.960 --> 03:01:29.840
managed to make it regardless oh just to just to touch up on what he briefly said

03:01:29.840 --> 03:01:33.960
I kind of had a different experience this year in anime next I mean the venue

03:01:33.960 --> 03:01:39.040
kicked severe ass because it was it was a lot better in terms of the game room

03:01:39.040 --> 03:01:42.680
being big and all and actually have it separate rooms but I don't know I just

03:01:42.680 --> 03:01:45.920
wasn't feeling it this year I mean previous years it was pretty I was

03:01:45.920 --> 03:01:49.440
pretty much hyped and it pretty much went through but I don't know I guess

03:01:49.440 --> 03:01:54.280
this year when I'd have been like a I'd have been you know wasn't what I expected

03:01:54.280 --> 03:01:58.280
but whatever guess we'll try for the next year what anyway what was missing

03:01:58.280 --> 03:02:03.000
for you was it was the game room lacking or what no the game room was fine that

03:02:03.000 --> 03:02:06.720
was I had nothing to do with it it's just like it wasn't I don't know if for

03:02:06.720 --> 03:02:10.560
some reason I wasn't really getting into some of the other panels I see like when

03:02:10.560 --> 03:02:13.920
I first went to anime next two years ago I was really getting into an adult swim

03:02:13.920 --> 03:02:19.200
panel that I got in there and maybe a couple of anime but it wasn't I wasn't

03:02:19.200 --> 03:02:23.320
feeling it this year unfortunately I'm sorry I'll let you get to whatever your

03:02:23.320 --> 03:02:27.000
anyways is but I have been to a lot of conventions myself and I'm not even that

03:02:27.000 --> 03:02:30.240
super into anime but I've seen a lot of piss-poor panels at conventions I'm

03:02:30.240 --> 03:02:35.280
sorry to say there's not like no nice way for me to say it yeah people stop

03:02:35.280 --> 03:02:40.360
using panels as an excuse to get a free badge and fucking do do a good panel and

03:02:40.360 --> 03:02:44.840
this goes both ways convention organizers screen your panelists better

03:02:44.840 --> 03:02:50.280
do not let your friend host a panel because they are your friend unless that

03:02:50.280 --> 03:02:55.680
friend is able to produce an outline ideas like everyone should have to knock

03:02:55.680 --> 03:02:59.600
it off you're ruining your own con anyway sorry well there was there was

03:02:59.600 --> 03:03:03.240
the particular one that I wanted to go to but you know it had to do with

03:03:03.240 --> 03:03:07.320
Bahmani stuff it was actually on Friday but by the time I made it there I was

03:03:07.320 --> 03:03:11.680
you know I had to like take my roommate to the hotel and check in and get food

03:03:11.680 --> 03:03:16.080
so I pretty much missed it by the time I got there what exactly are those Bahmani

03:03:16.080 --> 03:03:20.120
panels like these days damn we're in trouble no idea but it was held on

03:03:20.120 --> 03:03:24.920
Friday and Friday evening and I had to arrive in the con at that time to get my

03:03:24.920 --> 03:03:28.500
badge so it wasn't even worth it they were nice enough to let me sit in on the

03:03:28.500 --> 03:03:32.080
bahmanistyle.com panel at ASEN and you know as cool as it was to be

03:03:32.080 --> 03:03:35.200
sitting with some of those folks I really didn't feel like there was a lot

03:03:35.200 --> 03:03:39.340
to talk about a lot of the discussions focused around the concert that had

03:03:39.340 --> 03:03:42.400
happened the night before which is cool for the folks that are into that type of

03:03:42.400 --> 03:03:45.000
music I felt really lost or what have you because I haven't been following a

03:03:45.000 --> 03:03:48.100
lot of new Ryan's but when it came to actual talk on the Bahmani games like

03:03:48.100 --> 03:03:53.440
half of it was a joke it was it right anyway most of it for you know I even

03:03:53.440 --> 03:03:56.520
though I wasn't I wasn't actually there an ace and I could have could only

03:03:56.520 --> 03:04:00.920
imagine it's probably like insider info probably like inside joke something that

03:04:00.920 --> 03:04:04.960
would be a lot of inside jokes in the line you had any ways a minute ago

03:04:04.960 --> 03:04:09.820
Zaku please please go ahead with your anyways anyways I would basically a

03:04:09.820 --> 03:04:13.680
reason I call tonight is because you know I don't know if you probably know

03:04:13.680 --> 03:04:19.640
this but DDRX apparently hit arcades last week and the first one being the

03:04:19.640 --> 03:04:23.680
Levo the game works in Chicago that managed to get the first the first new

03:04:23.680 --> 03:04:30.540
cabin in the country and from from the initial reviews horrible let's just let

03:04:30.540 --> 03:04:34.320
just put it this way the fact that the cab managed to go down to the the cabin

03:04:34.320 --> 03:04:40.080
itself managed to go down to $10,000 as opposed to 15 you know previous releases

03:04:40.080 --> 03:04:46.720
they pretty much cut many corners noticeable corners like a laggy H you

03:04:46.720 --> 03:04:51.080
know like the LCD monitor a pad that's like half the the thickness of the

03:04:51.080 --> 03:04:56.920
original one the sense you know sensors in the arrows are pretty much they're

03:04:56.920 --> 03:05:00.560
just triggering or not even home just triggering spread and spontaneous so

03:05:00.560 --> 03:05:05.800
you're not holding it all just a lot of bullshit on that part run on the part of

03:05:05.800 --> 03:05:10.920
maybe bets in or an army for that matter just producing piss for new cabinets you

03:05:10.920 --> 03:05:15.160
know what I'm not surprised go back to last week's show as far as I'm concerned

03:05:15.160 --> 03:05:19.880
wheel that machine out to the barn and put a bullet in it it's done yeah at

03:05:19.880 --> 03:05:24.760
this point is like people are just writing DDRX off at this point because

03:05:24.760 --> 03:05:28.840
of the fact that the cabinets are just giving it a they're just giving it a bad

03:05:28.840 --> 03:05:34.240
rap I'm like I mean the upgrade kids haven't even been released yet but we

03:05:34.240 --> 03:05:38.800
have yet to see how they fare but so far the new cabinets just they're not

03:05:38.800 --> 03:05:44.280
sitting well with the fans the hardcore players I'm sadly not surprised that go

03:05:44.280 --> 03:05:46.840
we got to let you go so we can wrap up the show but thanks so much for calling

03:05:46.840 --> 03:05:51.800
in all right take care they're a little fatter too and nobody likes fat is it

03:05:51.800 --> 03:05:54.560
just me or does it sound like and we're gonna turn off the Skype for tonight so

03:05:54.560 --> 03:05:56.720
we can wrap up the show but thank you guys so much if you didn't get in

03:05:56.720 --> 03:05:59.760
remember you can always send us an email mailbag at orange laundry calm we do

03:05:59.760 --> 03:06:04.160
want your voice to be heard it is just me it sounds like this new

03:06:04.160 --> 03:06:08.280
machine like is like two DDR solo pads put together when you talk about the

03:06:08.280 --> 03:06:12.040
less responsive arrows and the thinner pads or whatever it sounds like a DDR

03:06:12.040 --> 03:06:15.640
solo machine all right I was like cutting costs to me you have a perfectly

03:06:15.640 --> 03:06:20.200
good cabinet that's worked for how many years now let's go and change it that's

03:06:20.200 --> 03:06:25.760
an awesome idea I never thought I would say this seven years ago when this whole

03:06:25.760 --> 03:06:29.440
show started and yes we're coming up on our seven seven year anniversary so show

03:06:29.440 --> 03:06:35.000
in two weeks believe it or not this first show is June 23rd 2002 I never

03:06:35.000 --> 03:06:39.560
thought I would say this seven years ago but we've talked too much about DDR the

03:06:39.560 --> 03:06:44.280
past two shows like that's how relevant it is right now in this world we can

03:06:44.280 --> 03:06:48.480
bring it back I could bring it back they just know the confidence in me no it's

03:06:48.480 --> 03:06:53.720
it's not gonna happen oh it would sorry Loki it would but it's not going it

03:06:53.720 --> 03:06:57.880
could yes it could all right we got to go around and get everybody's final

03:06:57.880 --> 03:07:02.000
thought and wrap up the show tonight and take care of it oh did you have any

03:07:02.000 --> 03:07:06.000
other like last things you want to even talk release dates oh my god we didn't

03:07:06.000 --> 03:07:09.400
do we want to go over those real quick could do that that's what happens when

03:07:09.400 --> 03:07:13.160
you try a new format is that you forget shit all right well then Loki why don't

03:07:13.160 --> 03:07:16.240
you go over some release dates for the u.s. before we wrap it up all right well

03:07:16.240 --> 03:07:20.360
this week we've got a quite a few games coming out but something you probably

03:08:27.120 --> 03:08:30.880
PlayStation 3 remember this is Japanese release dates I'm reading right now

03:08:30.880 --> 03:08:34.960
sometimes they get cool stuff before we do right now they're not getting a lot

03:08:34.960 --> 03:08:37.920
there isn't a single thing of note coming out on the Wii this week believe

03:08:37.920 --> 03:08:41.320
it or not and usually in Japan even a slow week you have something coming out

03:08:41.320 --> 03:08:45.080
on the Wii on the PlayStation 2 you have a couple other price drops going on

03:08:45.080 --> 03:08:49.480
mostly they are Neo Geo games like King of Fighters maximum impact regulation a

03:08:49.480 --> 03:08:53.680
metal slug complete samurai spirits all of those games are getting price

03:08:53.680 --> 03:08:58.840
reductions and perhaps this is in preparation for the sunsoft collection

03:08:58.840 --> 03:09:01.360
which is also coming out I think that's actually another price drop though

03:09:01.360 --> 03:09:04.520
they're all get just price drop price drop price drop this week over in Japan

03:09:04.520 --> 03:09:09.840

looking at the PSP fate unlimited codes portable comes out this week from Capcom

03:10:25.080 --> 03:10:31.040
on the PSP that looks to be a fun little game especially if you're into those

03:10:31.040 --> 03:10:36.040
Japanese fighting games I have some rapid-fire last-minute stories once you

03:10:36.040 --> 03:10:39.360
get some of the European news sure let's have time to do European days will do

03:10:39.360 --> 03:10:43.200
your last few stories then get out of here for the night it's almost 945 in

03:10:43.200 --> 03:10:46.960
the west coast yeah I need people are in my house actually I love you guys

03:10:46.960 --> 03:10:49.760
actually being over here cuz you know being in this little room doesn't feel

03:10:49.760 --> 03:10:53.880
sort of like the old school way we did it it does get go it does but Dan is

03:10:53.880 --> 03:10:57.320
making arrangements for us potentially yeah I'm hearing we might move to where

03:10:57.320 --> 03:11:01.120
the pinball machines are now you give me a little earlier to the garage where we

03:11:01.120 --> 03:11:03.240
met that we might bump the pinball machines for the show could be

03:11:03.240 --> 03:11:07.920
interesting but we we did trade creatures in the Black Lagoon for Lord

03:11:07.920 --> 03:11:13.720
of the Rings I miss not broken already I miss not having to commute but I guess

03:11:13.720 --> 03:11:16.520
if you guys have done it for so long I can do it for a little while at least so

03:11:16.520 --> 03:11:21.480
yeah well how about our your European releases how about it on the 16th we

03:11:21.480 --> 03:11:26.760
have Wallace and Gromit's grand adventures muzzled for PC and on 17th we

03:11:26.760 --> 03:11:30.960
have rocket riot which kind of sounds a little dirty to me the 18th Metal Gear

03:11:30.960 --> 03:11:35.680
Solid on PlayStation 3 and then the 19th we have rock band unplugged virtual

03:11:35.680 --> 03:11:43.480
tennis 2009 and Ghostbusters Ghostbusters by the way yes I really

03:11:43.480 --> 03:11:47.880
like that infamous game really yeah good somebody was just asking a little while

03:11:47.880 --> 03:11:50.920
ago why we don't talk about it on the show I haven't played much of it just

03:11:50.920 --> 03:11:55.520
because I've had a whole lot going on you know but it's totally between the

03:11:55.520 --> 03:11:59.800
guy coasting through the air with electricity and then being spider-man

03:11:59.800 --> 03:12:05.440
it's kind of funny meet the guy from crackdown I'm glad you said something

03:12:05.440 --> 03:12:08.480
about it I hope the listener who sent in that email listens to the end of the

03:12:08.480 --> 03:12:13.520
show so there you go all right Loki had some other stories you want to get to

03:12:13.520 --> 03:12:19.240
yes well what game out there could possibly create a peripheral that is 20

03:12:19.240 --> 03:12:23.440
times more expensive than the game itself well that game of course would be

03:12:23.440 --> 03:12:30.600
virtual on they do have a $300 arcade stick that you can get for the Xbox

03:12:30.600 --> 03:12:35.980
360 version it is from hori and yes it is 20 times the cost of the game which

03:12:35.980 --> 03:12:41.600
is only 15 bucks but it does have the twin sticks and go crazy with that so I

03:12:41.600 --> 03:12:46.800
wonder if you know how they had those little converter units where you could

03:12:46.800 --> 03:12:51.320
use like a PlayStation controller on the Xbox 360 you know the different ones you

03:12:51.320 --> 03:12:56.920
have to remap them and everything I wonder if there wouldn't be some type of

03:12:56.920 --> 03:13:01.040
converter that they can make the work use my dreamcast sticks I don't know I

03:13:01.040 --> 03:13:05.400
was then again I can just play it on dreamcast this is gonna sound so random

03:13:05.400 --> 03:13:10.120
but I have to say something I just realized you're wearing a DDR spot.com

03:13:10.120 --> 03:13:14.960
shirt yes I am that is fucking old school you know when I got this shirt

03:13:14.960 --> 03:13:20.960
yeah I got this shirt at my madness sure has to be as old as this show

03:13:20.960 --> 03:13:29.480
older I threw I threw away the other day my DDR mania X shirt I still have two

03:13:29.480 --> 03:13:33.000
DDR freak shirts left to you but now keep in mind no this is the thing

03:13:33.000 --> 03:13:38.160
remember when I got this it fit me oh yeah it's like that's like that's a

03:13:38.160 --> 03:13:42.960
pajamas now that's a sleepy shirt now yeah well good for you it's it's it's

03:13:42.960 --> 03:13:50.160
shirt I can wear without a bra well thanks for sharing okay low-key sorry

03:13:50.160 --> 03:13:54.360
well with the news of Left 4 Dead 2 possibly dividing the community maybe

03:13:54.360 --> 03:13:59.240
this will bring the community back together Left 4 Dead has finally got a

03:13:59.240 --> 03:14:04.960
nude Zoe mod for PC version yes that's right what came out what came out there

03:14:04.960 --> 03:14:08.480
with a female character would not be complete without a nude mod so I think

03:14:08.480 --> 03:14:13.880
we can all agree on that that nudity mods are a must and that's available on

03:14:13.880 --> 03:14:24.440
L4D mods.com got a lot of stuff nudity brings us together yes see here

03:14:24.440 --> 03:14:31.400
apparently Final Fantasy Tactics has been raided by the ESRB and people

03:14:31.400 --> 03:14:35.160
believe it's coming to the PlayStation Network sounds about right to me nice

03:14:35.160 --> 03:14:40.840
releasing a lonely crap nice I've been I have been so Jones and for the old

03:14:40.840 --> 03:14:44.320
school Final Fantasy Tactics like before it was on DS and all the other ones I

03:14:44.320 --> 03:14:49.680
really want to play like on my TV again Final Fantasy Tactics that Oh happy

03:14:49.680 --> 03:14:53.920
happy Rob yes kind of sad that I'll have to buy it all over again because I can't

03:14:53.920 --> 03:14:57.200
find my original PlayStation 1 disc but what can you do at least I'll have my

03:14:57.200 --> 03:14:59.720
Final Fantasy 8 discs so when they release that I'm not going to buy it

03:14:59.720 --> 03:15:02.400
because I still have my discs so I could play it on the PlayStation 3 if I wanted

03:15:02.400 --> 03:15:08.560
to yes apparently there's a rumor that Sony is going to unveil PSP Go apps and

03:15:08.560 --> 03:15:14.320
small games at gamescom and these are supposed to be of course non retail

03:15:14.320 --> 03:15:19.680
games and applications for the PSP and the file sizes are said to be limited to

03:15:19.680 --> 03:15:23.520
100 megabytes but developers and publishers will be limited other create

03:15:23.520 --> 03:15:29.400
other creative ways Sony is said to have some specifically stated non game apps

03:15:29.400 --> 03:15:41.840
and 2d tiles are more than welcome maker comparisons to iPhone now yes God I

03:15:41.840 --> 03:15:45.960
don't want to report on this but apparently there is another teaser site

03:15:45.960 --> 03:15:54.680
in Japan now for a brand new tingle game and I weep with sadness I weep tears of

03:15:54.680 --> 03:16:02.200
joy thank you for reporting that Loki is that it and finally Nintendo apparently

03:16:02.200 --> 03:16:11.560
has according I guess Guardian media technologies it was one of the patent

03:16:11.560 --> 03:16:15.520
lawsuits that Nintendo had to deal with well it's been thrown out of the court

03:16:15.520 --> 03:16:20.680
it says we are very pleased with the court's decision and Nintendo vigorously

03:16:20.680 --> 03:16:24.360
defends its patent lawsuits and at the earliest stages of this case Nintendo

03:16:24.360 --> 03:16:28.760
convinced the court to dismiss the case as guardians patent had nothing to do

03:16:28.760 --> 03:16:33.080
with Nintendo's products well I and I would despite all the crap I give

03:16:33.080 --> 03:16:35.520
Nintendo I think I agree with them here there's too many of these frivolous

03:16:35.520 --> 03:16:40.080
patent lawsuits if there's a patent lawsuit that's out there and they find

03:16:40.080 --> 03:16:43.720
that they have you know infringed on that patent then how could there be

03:16:43.720 --> 03:16:48.000
multiple lawsuits later on for the same types of things because I think at that

03:16:48.000 --> 03:16:51.600
case well you've already found that you've been infringing on this patent

03:16:51.600 --> 03:16:54.960
you need to go after that person because that's the person that has a patent for

03:16:54.960 --> 03:17:00.560
it not Nintendo and that's it all right well that's gonna do it here for another

03:17:00.560 --> 03:17:04.760
week of orange lounge radio we need to get everybody's final thought my god the

03:17:26.800 --> 03:17:30.680

but you know what hmm I have my next assessment you know what I'm gonna

03:18:14.400 --> 03:18:18.200
actually email the teacher and ask if I can go do the assessment earlier in the

03:18:18.200 --> 03:18:22.040
day and that might be a good idea and I don't know if we'll do anything special

03:18:22.040 --> 03:18:25.080
it's just you know we've we always try to do something special for the

03:18:25.080 --> 03:18:28.640
