00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:20,240
Today, June 14th, 2009. Could you soon use a turntable in Guitar Hero? Is Project Natal

2
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:24,960
actually a new Xbox console? And if one creator has his way, what video game might be the

3
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:33,880
next great sport? Orange Lounge Radio. Hello, everybody out there on the Internet, and welcome

4
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:42,480
to another week of Orange Lounge Radio, taping June the 14th, 2009. My name is Rob Roberts.

5
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:46,440
Joining me not tonight is the one and only Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers. She's actually

6
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:51,340
around. She didn't go on a vacation or anything, but she had school orientation some tonight

7
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:55,960
for her class, or I don't know what all's going on there, but I know she's school-related.

8
00:00:55,960 --> 00:01:00,440
She'll be joining us partway through the show, hopefully. She's anticipating she'll be here

9
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:06,120
about 8.15 Pacific, which usually our show's still taping by 8.30, 8.45, so she should

10
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:10,400
be here for the very, very end. But that's all right. We've still got Tech Master Loki

11
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:16,160
here tonight. Yes, I'm here. The very busy Tech Master Loki. Yes, I'm moving. Yes, you've

12
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:23,000
been moving lately. How's that going? Sucks. Yeah? Yeah. But I don't know if the listeners

13
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,680
are aware, but you actually moved from an apartment to your house. Not a rented house,

14
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:32,160
but one you have actually purchased. Yes. In this very sad economy, you were actually

15
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:37,800
able to make it work. Someone else's misfortune turned into your gain. Thank you, Fannie Mae.

16
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:44,160
No, seriously, they had a really kick-ass loan deal, got like a really low interest

17
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:50,440
rate, and normally, buyers like us, because we're not putting down a lot of money, you

18
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:56,280
would have to pay mortgage insurance, which that raises your monthly payments by a couple

19
00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:00,320
hundred dollars, which would price it out of range. However, they gave us a special

20
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:05,640
deal where we didn't have to have mortgage insurance, so we didn't. So it ends up now

21
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:12,200
our house payments are really about $60 more than what our apartment was. We're like, okay.

22
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:16,680
That's great. Wow. We can do that. I'm a little jealous, but see, I'm not married. I don't

23
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:20,440
have someone to share that type of income with. People say you can get a roommate and

24
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:23,980
so on and so on to make it work, but I just don't. It would be tough. It would be tough,

25
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:27,960
because what happens if you can't find one? That's the situation I find myself in. Or

26
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:32,880
if they leave, it would just be difficult. Our old buddy, Bobby Black Wolf, who tapes

27
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:36,880
before us live on Sunday nights at All Games Radio, where we start at six o'clock Pacific

28
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:41,320
but he starts at five o'clock Pacific, is in our chat room at chat.orangelaunchradio.com.

29
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:45,260
How much did I plug in that one sentence? He says, hey, I'm buying my first house this

30
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:48,960
summer too. I just got pre-approved for a mortgage. Congratulations. It's a good time

31
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:54,240
to do it, because that government program where you get eight grand back in your taxes

32
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:59,480
next year, that's putting a new roof on our house. Nice. That'd be awesome. Quick, anyone

33
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:06,560
want to get married? Buy a house with me? No, I'm just kidding. Oh my gosh. It's definitely

34
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:11,240
a time to buy. Now, bringing it back to video games, since that's what our show is all about,

35
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:16,240
is now your house. Are you doing anything special with the tech? I don't know necessarily

36
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:20,280
the games, because I know the wife is not a fan of games not called Excite Truck or

37
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:24,200
Bejeweled, but I know you were talking about something tech that you're doing with the

38
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:28,720
babies that are coming soon. We may do, like, I was thinking it would be cool to do video

39
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:34,600
monitors, because usually how you do a baby monitor that's audio or something like that.

40
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:40,600
But they had a commercial that I saw on TV, or like Home Depot or something like that,

41
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:45,520
where some guy was doing a project where he had video monitoring for their babies. But

42
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:50,400
having two of those, and we can do picture in picture on TV while we're watching TV and

43
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:54,240
stuff, you can see the two babies there. I don't know. That would probably be really

44
00:03:54,240 --> 00:04:01,760
expensive and a lot of work for something that's kind of neat. But we'll see. Mainly

45
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:07,160
network stuff I'm going to have to run a bunch of networking stuff through our attic, because

46
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:14,840
I can't stretch a 50-foot Cat 5 cable anymore. It's going to be interesting to see how your

47
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:19,400
stories change once those babies are born. I'm very curious to see what's going to change

48
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:23,720
in the house of Loki. We'll see. Alright, but congratulations on the house. That's something

49
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:27,400
else. Thank you. I helped him move into it Saturday, because that's what friends do.

50
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:34,520
And it's a nice house. It's very similar to the one I rent, but I only rent it. You know,

51
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:38,240
with the hardwood floors, and the one bathroom and three bedrooms, and the bedrooms are a

52
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:46,760
little small. I have to put in those floors. Yeah, they're laminate. It's a particle board.

53
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:51,640
It's kind of like this desk. More comments from chat.orangelaunchradio.com. If you're

54
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:55,600
listening to us on All Games Radio Live on this Sunday night, please join us. Say hello.

55
00:04:55,600 --> 00:05:00,320
Deekman says, you stream it. Or too creepy. I think that's a little too creepy. That'd

56
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:07,800
be boring. Who would watch baby monitors on YouTube? Well, I guess you'd be surprised.

57
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:14,840
And Toshan says, Loki, my neighbor has a video baby monitor. I could get info. I'm sure it's

58
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:19,680
easy to do, because it's just, I think it's just video. You probably wouldn't do audio.

59
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:24,600
And so it'd basically just be running the video line through the ceiling to wherever

60
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:29,160
you're going to watch it, I guess. Or they may even have it, you know, Wi-Fi, which would

61
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:33,760
make things even easier. They wouldn't have to run anything. Deekman in chat says, Loki,

62
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:38,540
get the angel care baby monitors. It beeps if the baby doesn't move. So it's advice from

63
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:43,400
another parent, because I know Deekman. Is that like the, what was it, everything's okay

64
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:51,680
alarm? Beep. Beep's not moving. That's scary stuff, though. But wow. All right. SSJ100Matt

65
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:55,200
says, I can think of a few people here who would watch it. That's a little creepy. I'm

66
00:05:55,200 --> 00:06:01,760
sorry. Why would you be watching that when you can play games? Like doing it for a minute

67
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:07,920
to go, aw, how cute. I'll just put pictures up. It's like watching the kitty, like tons

68
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:12,220
of people on Justin TV do this, have the kitties on Justin TV. Like you'll watch it for a minute

69
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:16,560
and go, aw, it's cute. But like if you're watching it for like hours at a time, like

70
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:19,880
seriously, you need to just adopt a cat. There's many cats out there that could use a good

71
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:26,720
home. Yeah. Our cat did not like moving. But that's pretty cool that you have like, you

72
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,320
know, that we've been doing this show long enough and we have such an awesome listener

73
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:36,000
base that essentially the listeners are offing to babysit your children via Ustream. Well,

74
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:42,800
I don't know, that's. I know, it's not, it's no substitute for the real thing. All right.

75
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:46,440
We're going to get into our gaming weeks and talk about how is your gaming week. And you

76
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:49,240
know, if there was something you played at E3 that we didn't get to last week, because

77
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:52,160
I know there's a couple games I want to talk about tonight, feel free to get into that

78
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:57,520
as well. How was your gaming week, Loki? Honestly, I don't remember anything I played at E3. Like

79
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:04,240
people ask me, so what'd you play? Like, uh, stuff? No, I remember playing one thing I

80
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:11,440
played at Sega, was it Sega Rally All Stars or I don't know. It's some sort of like Mario

81
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:16,840
Kart with Sega characters game. And it was like Mario Kart with Sega characters game.

82
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:22,600
You know what's weird though? Is they have like commentators, which is odd. I was not

83
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:26,480
imagining commentators in that kind of game. Is that the game that's supposed to have like

84
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:30,800
Greg Proops as a commentator? No, no, no. That's Mad World. That's awesome. Oh, that's

85
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:37,320
right. Okay. That would be, that's already out. Why did I think that was a racing game?

86
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:42,160
I don't know, but hey, they want to come back and do commentary in that game. You know,

87
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:49,160
not changing up any of the language whatsoever. I might actually make that game good. No,

88
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:54,600
so I played that. I think that was like kind of on Thursday when I was just like, eh, I

89
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:57,560
don't know what I want to do, so I'm going to start playing some random games. I watch

90
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:03,320
people play a lot of stuff, but I don't know. This week I actually played, you know, more

91
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:13,760
Grand Theft Auto 4, because we play that every day. I played some Prototype, which is fun.

92
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:20,760
It's really underwhelming as far as graphics go. I mean, it's very plain looking, but if

93
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:23,880
you think about the developer of the game, they actually were the ones that did like

94
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:29,880
the Hulk, the Ultimate Destruction stuff. It's very simple graphics, but it's the same

95
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:35,800
type of gameplay where you can throw things in the stuff and just go crazy. You can absorb

96
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:40,840
people and take their life to kind of boost your health and stuff like that. When you

97
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:47,560
do that, it's just brutal. You'll just step on their face or knee them in the groin and

98
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:54,360
they just absorb into your body. It's just weird, but it's absolutely bloody. Most games

99
00:08:54,360 --> 00:09:00,800
are just kind of that brown color. This is all red. It's just red everywhere, just blood.

100
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:03,720
It's awesome, but I haven't really played too much of it.

101
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:07,680
Yeah, the actual blood isn't that cartoony red. Like when you get a paper cut, it looks

102
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,840
cartoony red, but real blood is like...

103
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:14,560
No, people explode. It's just stained all over the street. I mean, it's just crazy.

104
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:19,760
Unless it's over the top, which it sounds like it is. See, and we get into the topic

105
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:24,080
we got into a few weeks ago, talking about Saw and that whole thing, where I can't watch

106
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:27,920
the Saw movies because it's too real for me. But when the violence is over the top...

107
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:28,920
Yeah, this is over the top.

108
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:31,080
Okay, I think that stuff is funny.

109
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:34,520
Like snapping people in half and stuff like that. It's just ridiculous.

110
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:36,840
Mortal Kombat, over the top, always has been.

111
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:41,740
You can grab somebody and just run into the ground with them. There was one that they

112
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:46,520
had in a video where he grabs a soldier, slams down into a building, jumps up again, slams

113
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:51,240
down to another building, keeps going down until he flies off the skyscraper, and then

114
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:56,960
slams it into the ground. Plus, you can do sprinting. It'll automatically do the parkour

115
00:09:56,960 --> 00:10:02,120
stuff. So you can jump off buildings, running upside of buildings. Just absolutely crazy

116
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:02,840
stuff.

117
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:07,520
But being spoiled with games like Crackdown and stuff, where it actually looks pretty

118
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:15,520
and does most of that stuff, really there's no excuse for that. But hey, who cares? It's

119
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:19,560
fun. It's worth playing.

120
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:24,240
The other game I tried to play this week, and really pissed me off because once I found

121
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:30,080
out about this game, I'm like, oh, I gotta get this. Angry Berry, which is an XNA game.

122
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:38,080
It's basically Obama the game, the fighting, it's like a Final Fight type game. It's absolutely

123
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:44,840
ridiculous. The problem is it's broken on Xbox community games right now. You can download

124
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:50,680
the game and it won't boot up at all, and you waste money, which sucks. But Angry Berry-

125
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:52,960
Wait, don't these things have to go through like a-

126
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:57,640
Yeah, they should, and it pissed me off because it was working, so apparently he updated something

127
00:10:57,640 --> 00:11:03,640
and it broke it. So now I paid for this and I can't play it, and it's really making me

128
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:04,840
sad because-

129
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:09,160
I'm actually looking at some footage of this here in studio off of YouTube.

130
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:13,760
It's absolutely ridiculous. You can pick up- the first level, you're apparently fighting

131
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:15,760
like old ladies, and then-

132
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:20,800
Yeah, cat ladies in Central Park. On the start of his quest, Berry runs into a bunch of old

133
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:24,600
dotties- went off the screen, let me roll it back a little bit- a bunch of old dotties

134
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:29,680
who have a much different idea of who should rule the world. As he continues, Berry is

135
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:34,480
haunted by a ghost from his past who may end his quest before it starts. And-

136
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:38,280
So basically the game's kind of funny because he runs around and he can punch things and

137
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:42,280
stuff like that, and he can punch people in the face, but he can also pick up stuff, like

138
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:44,280
unrealistically, like, you know, the park bench.

139
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:45,280
It just picked up a bench.

140
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:50,280
Oh no, it gets better. It gets better. He can pick up people by their heads, and then

141
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:55,280
he can also pick up, like, buses and stuff. It's just absolutely ridiculous. See, there-

142
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:58,280
he picked up a jogger and he's like trying to smash people.

143
00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:03,280
Okay, but the- the caliber quality of this game looks like somewhere between NES and

144
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:04,280
Super Nintendo.

145
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:05,780
It's awesome, the way you can-

146
00:12:05,780 --> 00:12:09,280
Somebody's running by yelling, have my baby, Berry. That's, uh-

147
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:14,280
Wait, wait, wait. Keep going until you get to the bus because that's hilarious.

148
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:18,280
Let me fast forward a little ways here, if I can.

149
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:22,280
He picked up the jogger.

150
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:26,280
Part of me wonders if this is, like, really disrespectful. I don't know. There's the bus.

151
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:29,280
This is awesome right here.

152
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:31,280
Bunch of old ladies getting out of the bus.

153
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:32,280
Old ladies and stuff.

154
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:35,280
They just picked up the bus and started smashing old ladies.

155
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:40,280
That's awesome. Right there. That was instant purchase for me. I'm like, I must buy this game.

156
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:42,280
And I did, like, instantly.

157
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:43,280
Problem was-

158
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:46,280
But it doesn't work. Well then how come it works in this little demo I'm looking at on YouTube?

159
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:49,280
I don't know, but there's a lot of people who have played it too.

160
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:52,280
But for whatever reason it's broken now. I get a code 4 error.

161
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:58,280
So they have a thing, actually. You report it to Xbox.com slash abuse, and there's a link to-

162
00:12:58,280 --> 00:13:03,280
Normally it's for offensive stuff, but there's also a thing for if it's broken.

163
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:07,280
And so hopefully they'll fix it. It says I purchased it, and then I'll get to play it.

164
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:11,280
Ssj100matt in our chatroom, chat.orangewordancemedia.com wants to clarify,

165
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:14,280
when the fixed version comes out, you can re-download it and it will be okay.

166
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:16,280
You don't need to buy it again.

167
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:20,280
And it's Angry Berry, like B-A-R-R-Y, like Barack.

168
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:23,280
Not Angry Berry as in, like, Raspberry or Dingleberry.

169
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:25,280
Yes. Angry Berry.

170
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:28,280
And it looks awesome.

171
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:31,280
Interesting. Alright, anything else for your gaming week?

172
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:32,280
No, that's it for right now.

173
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:36,280
Alright, I want to talk about a few games that I played at E3 that I never got around to last week.

174
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:40,280
And one of them is Blur, which is a pretty highly anticipated racing game, obviously,

175
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:44,280
because it's coming from Bizarre Creations, who used to do the Project Gotham Racing.

176
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:49,280
And, you know, as you know, they're doing their own series now. Blur has been announced what it is.

177
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:55,280
And it's really not like Project Gotham Racing at all, which I could never really get into Project Gotham Racing

178
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:59,280
because it was a little too much for me. Like, I can't control the car right.

179
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:01,280
I'm too used to arcade racing games.

180
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:03,280
Besides, I have Need for Speed Shift now, if you wanted that.

181
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:10,280
Well, and the good news is, or, you know, the Forza series is continuing with Adam and all that.

182
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:12,280
Anyhow...

183
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:15,280
Well, Project Gotham, I don't know if that's still...

184
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:18,280
I'm sorry. Yeah, Project Gotham, I don't know if that's continuing, but...

185
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:19,280
I think it is.

186
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:28,280
Yeah. Anyhow, Blur is now, like, a realistic racing game, but it mixes that with the types of stuff you'd see in Mario Kart,

187
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:33,280
which I thought was actually kind of cool. Like, you know, the graphics obviously had a very electric feel to it.

188
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:37,280
I'm not just talking about, that's why, because you see that in the trailer,

189
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:42,280
but this very kind of, like, neon metal sort of look to it, like the blues and pinks and yellow,

190
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:46,280
like, not, like, over the top, like, 80s, but kind of that metallic look to it.

191
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:48,280
It's a very kind of neat, stylish-looking game.

192
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:54,280
And as you race around the course, you can, you know, race over these power-ups, just like you do in Mario Kart,

193
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:59,280
and they'll give you things such as a missile-type thing where you launch a red sphere at other cars in front of you,

194
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:06,280
something called, like, Barrage, I think it was called, or something where it was, like, a purple thing that you'd shoot out on the sides, essentially,

195
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:12,280
so you could push your way past somebody, and then, like, a bolt that would just send a random lightning bolt down,

196
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:14,280
and, of course, a nitro that would speed you up.

197
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:19,280
All these different types of power-ups in a Burnout-style arcade racer,

198
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:24,280
not where, like, you know, pile-ups and crashing cars is encouraged like it is in Burnout,

199
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:27,280
but that sort of, like, look and speed and feel to the cars to it.

200
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:32,280
And the way they had it set up at E3 is that they had, like, 20 Xboxes all networked together,

201
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:34,280
and everybody was essentially playing the same thing.

202
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:37,280
And I had a lot of fun playing it. I think it'll be a fun game on Xbox Live.

203
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:40,280
It's like Mario Kart, but more real cars.

204
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:44,280
So, and from what I am understanding, they're actually licensing real cars for this game.

205
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:45,280
Yeah.

206
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:48,280
So it's, like, real cars that shoot lightning.

207
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:52,280
So it's a little strange, but it was actually a heck of a lot of fun to play.

208
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:54,280
I think I'm going to pick up the whole thing when it comes out.

209
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:56,280
I don't know what you're thinking, Loki.

210
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:57,280
I know you didn't play it, but...

211
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:58,280
Oh, no, you did play it a little bit, didn't you?

212
00:15:58,280 --> 00:15:59,280
No.

213
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:01,280
Oh, and, sorry, the Xbox broke when you sat down on the floor, didn't it?

214
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:03,280
The server crashed when I tried to play it.

215
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:04,280
That's right.

216
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:07,280
I hope it looked fun.

217
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:11,280
Some other games I played at E3 that I wanted to point out.

218
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:14,280
White Knight Chronicles, I think we touched on a little bit last week.

219
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:15,280
Yeah.

220
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:16,280
I didn't play it, but I watched Loki play it.

221
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:18,280
It looks like a lot of fun.

222
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:19,280
That's a role-playing game.

223
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:23,280
It looks pretty intensive, and I definitely want to check that out.

224
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:25,280
That's a good exclusive for PlayStation 3.

225
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:26,280
It is.

226
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:28,280
Especially if you're, like, the role-playing fan type.

227
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:33,280
Because it looks like it has the huge landscapes, kind of like Oblivion does, but it's more

228
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:35,280
of a third-person-oriented game.

229
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:37,280
It reminds me a lot of Final Fantasy XI.

230
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:39,280
Like, the landscape's very similar to that.

231
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:40,280
Really?

232
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:41,280
There's zones.

233
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:42,280
But not online.

234
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:43,280
This game was not online.

235
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:44,280
It's online, no.

236
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:46,280
You actually, well, you can play online.

237
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:50,280
You can play online with a party of a few people, and then you can do that.

238
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:51,280
Or it's AI.

239
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:52,280
And the AI actually is good.

240
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:56,280
They do what they're supposed to, and they're not doing retarded things.

241
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:59,280
So that's kind of cool.

242
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:01,280
But I think it is online, too.

243
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:02,280
So that might be fun.

244
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:06,280
I don't think I ever mentioned last week that I did try out Katamari Forever, which is the

245
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:10,280
new Katamari Damacy game on PlayStation 3 that takes some of the old levels and kind of repackages

246
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:11,280
them.

247
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,280
And there are some newer levels, too.

248
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:17,280
Like, for instance, I played a level where you were rolling around the Katamari, and

249
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:19,280
you would start in water.

250
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:21,280
And then as you rolled around, you lost water.

251
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:23,280
Kind of like, imagine your Katamari's a giant sponge.

252
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:25,280
And you're basically rolling it over dirt.

253
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:27,280
And as you roll over the dirt, flowers grow.

254
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:32,280
So the idea was you tried to paint so much of the ground with flowers and the time limit.

255
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:35,280
And then there's some secret, you know, the gal that was showing off the game was showing

256
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:39,280
me there's some secret areas where you can find more water so you don't have to run back

257
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:41,280
every time as you lose the water.

258
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:44,280
And that's kind of the strategy to get higher scores in that level.

259
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:46,280
So there are some new things in the game.

260
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:49,280
So Katamari Forever is not just a rehashing of the old stages.

261
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:53,280
The one thing that was cool about it is that they have different art styles.

262
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:56,280
There's very unique different art styles now that you can use.

263
00:17:56,280 --> 00:18:00,280
Especially this whole, where it starts all in black and white.

264
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:05,280
And then as you roll over objects, those objects will be in color anywhere you see them.

265
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:06,280
Which I thought was kind of cool.

266
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:11,280
So some of these new art styles they're adding are making the game feel newer and certainly

267
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:15,280
it's not just like, oh, we're just going to repackage the same game on Playstation 3

268
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:17,280
and, you know, with widescreen and we're done.

269
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:19,280
You know, they definitely have gone back and done some tweaks.

270
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:23,280
At the end of the day, though, it is still a lot of the same levels, you know, and things.

271
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:27,280
So if you've owned every other Katamari game, well, heck, you're probably a big enough

272
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:28,280
fan of the franchise.

273
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:29,280
We're going to want to buy this anyway.

274
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:35,280
But I definitely had, in the few minutes that I was playing this, I already had more fun

275
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,280
playing it than I did beautiful Katamari on the 360.

276
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:39,280
Which I just never got into.

277
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:40,280
I don't know what it is.

278
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:41,280
I don't know what it was about that game.

279
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:43,280
Maybe it's just the controller of all things.

280
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:46,280
I just could not get into Katamari on the 360.

281
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:47,280
But the Playstation 3 one was fun.

282
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:51,280
They added a new game mechanic, too, where you can actually bounce, you actually basically

283
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:53,280
jump with the Katamari.

284
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:58,280
Which is a little unrealistic, but hey, I mean, rolling around, rolling up entire islands

285
00:18:58,280 --> 00:18:59,280
in the earth is a little unrealistic, too.

286
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:03,280
You know, I don't like, the only thing I would change about Katamari is I don't like

287
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:10,280
the action that you have to do, the motion, to charge up your ball to do a little dash.

288
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:14,280
I think it should just be a button press, which would make things a lot easier, because

289
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:18,280
it's just a pain in the ass to kind of rock it back and forth to do that.

290
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:22,280
Yeah, you know, I didn't actually try doing that, the dash.

291
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:25,280
I was playing too much with the jump and the whole flipping.

292
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:28,280
I like to do the, you know, you click the buttons and it flips the ball around so you

293
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:31,280
don't have to spend the whole time doing a turn.

294
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:38,280
In the chat, Azure Edge is saying, in Japan, Katamari Forever is called Katamari Tribute.

295
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:39,280
Yeah, it's true.

296
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:40,280
It was a different name in Japan.

297
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:44,280
I believe it's already out over there.

298
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:45,280
It was fun.

299
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:46,280
I might pick it up.

300
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:49,280
I was under the impression, I don't know why, I thought this game was an arcade game

301
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:52,280
when I first saw it, like it was a Sony download game, but it's not.

302
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:54,280
They told me it is coming out on disc.

303
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:57,280
Yeah, that's what people thought, and it is coming out on disc.

304
00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:00,280
So it is a full disc game, just in case you weren't aware.

305
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:06,280
One other game I think I wanted to mention, I'm looking at my notes.

306
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:08,280
Oh, Toy Story Midway Mania.

307
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:12,280
I never mentioned this game, which is, you know, Don't Write It Off is simply a child's

308
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:13,280
little shoot-em game.

309
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:17,280
This is one for Disney fans, which, you know, I know some of our listeners are.

310
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:21,280
It is just like the ride that they have at Disneyland and Walt Disney World.

311
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:23,280
They opened them both up this year.

312
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:25,280
It's pretty much the same ride where you sit in the cars and go around.

313
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:27,280
However, they have added new stages.

314
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:30,280
There's like a skee-ball type stage, and you know, some other little games.

315
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:34,280
And apparently it's the whole thing where as you play more and get more points,

316
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:35,280
you can unlock more mini-games.

317
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:37,280
But here's the funniest thing about it.

318
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:40,280
It is going to come with 3D glasses, and you can play the games in 3D,

319
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:41,280
just like you do on the ride.

320
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:43,280
So I think that's kind of funny.

321
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:44,280
Pretty cool.

322
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:48,280
Yeah, so I think this game is, you know, if you're a Disney fan,

323
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:51,280
for most people, especially you're really hardcore gamers,

324
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:52,280
you're going to look at this and go,

325
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:56,280
this is just another crappy Wii game with a bunch of, you know, little mini-games.

326
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:59,280
But I think especially like if you have kids, or you're just like a Disney fan,

327
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:03,280
and you have, like for me, it's the nostalgia of the ride

328
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:05,280
and being at Disneyland that really does it for me.

329
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:06,280
So it's cool.

330
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:07,280
It's a cool little mini-game collection.

331
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:09,280
The other one that I thought was kind of cool is a mini-game,

332
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:13,280
and it's kind of like Jenga, where you, like these little block structures

333
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:16,280
will appear, and like you load this cannon with a ball,

334
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:18,280
and then you kind of swing the Wiimote to throw the ball.

335
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:21,280
And then depending on like when and where you throw it,

336
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:24,280
you knock, you're trying to knock over as many blocks as possible.

337
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:25,280
Boom blocks, awesome.

338
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:28,280
Is it kind of like, yeah, it's kind of a rip off of that, I guess.

339
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:29,280
But I thought that was kind of fun.

340
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:31,280
So take it or leave it.

341
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:32,280
There you go.

342
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:35,280
All right, just so you know tonight on the show,

343
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:37,280
getting into some housekeeping a little bit,

344
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:39,280
we're going to try something new tonight with the show,

345
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:41,280
kind of just based on feedback and things we've been wanting to do for a while,

346
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:43,280
which is a little weird because Jamie's not here,

347
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:45,280
but she knows about it, and she'll get here probably halfway through the show

348
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:46,280
and be able to help out.

349
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:49,280
We're going to try something tonight, and it may or may not work.

350
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:52,280
First off, we're going to have the Skypline open all night long,

351
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:54,280
which I know we've done before to make success,

352
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:58,280
but one reason we think people don't usually call in

353
00:21:58,280 --> 00:22:00,280
when we have the Skypline open all night long

354
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:02,280
is that we move too quick from story to story.

355
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:08,280
So since most of you guys that listen to the show already know the news

356
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:10,280
and kind of the main rundown of stuff that happened in the week,

357
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:13,280
I'm sure you read gaming blogs, you listen to other shows,

358
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:16,280
we want to expand a little more on having roundtable discussions

359
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:18,280
on a limited scope of stories.

360
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:21,280
Don't worry, we'll bring you the quick news too close to the end of the show,

361
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:24,280
but we're going to try focusing on in our Part A and Part B,

362
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:27,280
just like maybe six stories each segment,

363
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:30,280
that can kind of get a little more discussion.

364
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:33,280
So if you want to call in at any point during the show to add to the discussion,

365
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:36,280
you can always give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR,

366
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:39,280
or of course you can always send us emails and so forth.

367
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:42,280
Of course our chat room, chat.orangelandraday.com,

368
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:43,280
is always available there as well.

369
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:46,280
And then of course we're going to spend a little more time in studio

370
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:47,280
talking about these different topics.

371
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:49,280
So let us know your feedback.

372
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:51,280
Of course, as always, mailbag at orangelandraday.com,

373
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:54,280
or our Twitter, twitter.com slash o-l-r,

374
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:58,280
or the Facebook group, the OL Army,

375
00:22:58,280 --> 00:23:00,280
which we haven't really done anything with for a while.

376
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:01,280
We need to.

377
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:03,280
And yeah, so we're just going to open it up.

378
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:07,280
Less stories, more time on each story is basically what it boils down to.

379
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:10,280
So let's see what happens.

380
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:13,280
So I'll start off tonight with a news story

381
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:17,280
that kind of confirms something we heard about a while ago.

382
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:19,280
There was a trademark about this a little while ago

383
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:23,280
that spurred this whole debate I think we've had once before on the show.

384
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:25,280
But it was confirmed.

385
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:29,280
Nintendo will be launching a help feature inside of their games.

386
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:32,280
This story comes from USA Today's Game Hunter blog.

387
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:34,280
Game Hunter's blog, sorry.

388
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:37,280
And it's talking about how Miyamoto has essentially confirmed

389
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:40,280
that on New Super Mario Brothers Wii,

390
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:43,280
you're going to be able to pause the game if you're on a difficult level,

391
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:45,280
and the game can take over to complete the level,

392
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:49,280
and then you hit a button whenever you want to resume playing.

393
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:52,280
And the thought behind it is that if you have a younger player

394
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:54,280
or you have somebody who is newer to video games,

395
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:56,280
they don't get so intimidated by it.

396
00:23:56,280 --> 00:24:01,280
Which, if you remember right, was Nintendo's whole thing in the first place.

397
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:04,280
The whole reason why they introduced the Wii in the first place was that,

398
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:06,280
hey, everybody knows how to use a remote control.

399
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:08,280
People get intimidated by game controllers.

400
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:11,280
Let's take that intimidation factor out.

401
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:14,280
But now they're talking about, oh, now they're going to take,

402
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:18,280
essentially, the challenge out of the game for those that want it.

403
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:22,280
And of course, as you can imagine, this is hugely controversial.

404
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:26,280
Moving on with the story, Shigeru Miyamoto did say in the interview

405
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:29,280
that there's going to be this demo play,

406
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:32,280
is what they're calling it, the tentative name of this, the demo play.

407
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:34,280
Here's the quote from the article.

408
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:36,280
Quote, in New Super Mario Brothers Wii,

409
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:39,280
if a player is experiencing an area of difficulty,

410
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:42,280
this will allow them to clear troubled areas and take over when they're ready.

411
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:46,280
And yes, we're looking into this for future games, too.

412
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:48,280
So it's the easy button.

413
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:50,280
Like in the Staples commercials, you hit the button,

414
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:52,280
and easy, you get your way through it.

415
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:54,280
Good thing, bad thing, Loki.

416
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:59,280
As I mentioned earlier, I know it's wrong to say this,

417
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:01,280
but this is completely gay.

418
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:03,280
And the reason why...

419
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:05,280
It does make me want to sleep with games of the same gender.

420
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:06,280
Exactly.

421
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:07,280
It does.

422
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:13,280
No, it's okay to have... I guess it's alright if they want to put this option in

423
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:16,280
to other games, like Zelda or something like that.

424
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:20,280
That makes sense, because you're playing it demo-wise,

425
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:22,280
you can learn more of the story and stuff.

426
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:24,280
New Super Mario Brothers for the Wii,

427
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:26,280
I can't imagine that has a story at all.

428
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:30,280
So really, you're basically taking away the only element of the game,

429
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:32,280
which is playing it.

430
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:35,280
And so, I don't know.

431
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:38,280
I can't imagine these games being that difficult,

432
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:42,280
and the fact is that you can actually just autopilot the whole thing

433
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:44,280
seems kind of retarded to me.

434
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:47,280
And also, in the same way people are defending it and saying,

435
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:51,280
well, this will allow you to be able to make the games more hardcore,

436
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:53,280
more difficult for those that want it,

437
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:56,280
and those that can't handle it, well, they can push the easy button.

438
00:25:56,280 --> 00:26:00,280
But at the same time, why can't they just balance it,

439
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:02,280
put the effort into balancing the game,

440
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:05,280
so that you have it for the easy players,

441
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:07,280
and for the more experienced players?

442
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:09,280
Oh, I know, like effort.

443
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:12,280
No, let's just autopilot the whole thing.

444
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:13,280
That's even better.

445
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:14,280
Okay, but what about the argument,

446
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:16,280
and this is the first thing I think of too,

447
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:18,280
and I see AlphaCananagram going to it in chat,

448
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:19,280
don't use it.

449
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:21,280
You don't like it, don't use it.

450
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:24,280
I don't care, it's just insulting that it's there in the first place.

451
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:28,280
I mean, because really, the message that comes across with that

452
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:30,280
is not that, oh, we're trying to help players.

453
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:33,280
Maybe like Devil May Cry or something like that,

454
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:38,280
or a game that's been notably insanely hard all the time.

455
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:41,280
Maybe something like an easy mode for that or something,

456
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:44,280
but not necessarily something that just plays the game for yourself.

457
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:51,280
I don't know, I think the better option should be something more approachable

458
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:55,280
as far as an easier gameplay option or something like that,

459
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:57,280
an easier difficulty so that those people...

460
00:26:57,280 --> 00:27:00,280
you can take those portions of the game that are going to be frustrating out of it

461
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:03,280
or make them easier on this new difficulty.

462
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:06,280
I'm supposed to give you a slap on the wrist for calling it gay, by the way,

463
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:07,280
from the chatters.

464
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:09,280
Whatever, you know.

465
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:12,280
Obviously, he doesn't mean harm by that,

466
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:13,280
or I would, you know, I'm gay.

467
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:16,280
I'd kick his ass if I thought he actually meant malice by that,

468
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:20,280
but it is one of those things where I think the reason why you say that

469
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:23,280
and even why I allow you to say that

470
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:29,280
is because Nintendo does have that whole happy, sunshiny, rainbow, clouds.

471
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:32,280
If you think back to the old meaning of gay,

472
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:33,280
it does have that very...

473
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:34,280
You know what I mean?

474
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:37,280
It has that feel to it that Nintendo is all sugary sweet to it.

475
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:40,280
It's not even really entirely Nintendo's fault.

476
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:42,280
I put blame on society for this, too,

477
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:46,280
because nowadays it's not about, you know...

478
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:49,280
It's about everybody participating and everybody's a winner

479
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:51,280
because they've participated.

480
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:53,280
That's great, except you're not participating.

481
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:56,280
You're just pushing a button and the game's doing it all for yourself.

482
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:58,280
So now that you've seen the end of the game,

483
00:27:58,280 --> 00:28:00,280
what's really going to entice you to go through it?

484
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:02,280
I mean, on your own.

485
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:03,280
It's not.

486
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:06,280
And it really just sends home the message that

487
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:09,280
Nintendo doesn't really give a crap about the core game.

488
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:11,280
I mean, they do in a certain sense,

489
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:15,280
but at the same time, really, their console is for the younger audience

490
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:17,280
and, well, we're making a few games for you as well.

491
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:19,280
Let me read some comments from chat.

492
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:21,280
And if you have a thought on this, too, give us a call.

493
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:23,280
1-877-GAME-OLR.

494
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:25,280
Is this making games too easy? What's going on?

495
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:27,280
Some other comments from chat here.

496
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:28,280
And this is one I agree with.

497
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:29,280
There's a gold anthro in chat that says,

498
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:31,280
you will have the temptation to use it.

499
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:32,280
That's the problem.

500
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:35,280
And for me, that might make me a little nervous, too.

501
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:36,280
But let's go to the phones.

502
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:37,280
We have a call.

503
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:40,280
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this?

504
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:45,280
Hello, you're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this?

505
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:48,280
And wouldn't you know, like, the first call we take,

506
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:50,280
it doesn't work.

507
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:52,280
Didn't use the easy button.

508
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:53,280
That's right.

509
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:54,280
Your call needs to be automated.

510
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:56,280
Can I please pause the show and hit the button?

511
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:57,280
No, all right.

512
00:28:57,280 --> 00:28:58,280
Here's the thing.

513
00:28:58,280 --> 00:29:04,280
I'm also surprised that this was not launched in the Zelda type of game.

514
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:06,280
And I kind of get it for that.

515
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:09,280
But I kind of agree with what GameGuru is saying in chat.

516
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:10,280
It's a Super Mario Brothers game.

517
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:13,280
If you can't play, you may as well give up gaming.

518
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:14,280
I don't know. Let's see.

519
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:16,280
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this?

520
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:18,280
Hi, this is Gold Anthro, actually.

521
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:19,280
Oh, Gold Anthro.

522
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:20,280
I just read one of your comments a minute ago.

523
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:21,280
What are your thoughts on this?

524
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:24,280
Is this making games too easy?

525
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:25,280
I think it is.

526
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:27,280
Because, you know, people say,

527
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:29,280
don't use it if you don't want to.

528
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:32,280
Like, if you don't want to use it, don't use it.

529
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:35,280
But there's that temptation.

530
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:37,280
Ah, sorry.

531
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:42,280
There's a temptation that people will use it because it is there.

532
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:47,280
I mean, if there's no reward for not using it, I'm sorry.

533
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:49,280
I got my family yelling at me.

534
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:50,280
You know what I mean.

535
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:51,280
There's going to be that temptation.

536
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:52,280
No, that's okay.

537
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:55,280
That's kind of where I feel, too, is that it gives that temptation.

538
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:57,280
But I'm trying to look at both sides of this.

539
00:29:57,280 --> 00:29:58,280
I really am.

540
00:29:58,280 --> 00:30:02,280
The Wii is that family-friendly, even your...

541
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:04,280
I'm going to let you go, Gold Anthro, but thanks for the feedback.

542
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:11,280
Wii's got that very family-friendly soccer mom,

543
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:14,280
let the seven-year-old play Image to Preserve.

544
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:18,280
You know, a feature like this kind of makes sense for a system like that.

545
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:20,280
I don't think it does.

546
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:27,280
The problem with Nintendo and a lot of the game publishers

547
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:32,280
and a lot of the companies out there that are producing consoles is this.

548
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:36,280
They're making the consoles and the games more approachable

549
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:38,280
to people that don't play games,

550
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:41,280
but people are still not biting on them,

551
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:43,280
and so they're like, why are they not?

552
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:44,280
Let me take another call.

553
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:45,280
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

554
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:46,280
Who's this?

555
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:47,280
Hi, it's Sterlok.

556
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:48,280
Hi, Sterlok.

557
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:50,280
What do you think about this whole Nintendo easy mode

558
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:52,280
or what they're calling it demo mode?

559
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:54,280
Is this a good idea, bad idea?

560
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:57,280
I think it's a great idea.

561
00:30:57,280 --> 00:31:03,280
I'm blind, and this would be awesome for something like Zelda

562
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:08,280
because I just like to walk around and just dick around.

563
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:17,280
If I want to get further, it's really easy to just turn this thing on.

564
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:18,280
I think it's a great idea.

565
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:21,280
You're saying that you're blind

566
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:25,280
and that you have probably problems with certain other games.

567
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:29,280
Do you find Zelda to be too hard the way it is now?

568
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:33,280
You probably kind of learn to deal with that

569
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:35,280
as you're playing with the video games, right?

570
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:39,280
Yeah, since I'm totally blind, I just play with sound.

571
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:42,280
Are you the same one that sent us e-mails before

572
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:44,280
on some of these subjects about some of the music games?

573
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:46,280
Okay, yeah, I remember you.

574
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:49,280
I guess here's kind of my thought.

575
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:52,280
That's a very good thing I wouldn't have thought of before

576
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:54,280
is that maybe it makes some of these games more handicap accessible,

577
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:57,280
certainly, if there's something a little too difficult.

578
00:31:57,280 --> 00:32:02,280
But you've kind of come all this time gaming with that.

579
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:06,280
So why now for this?

580
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:10,280
Well, the main thing for me is progressing in the game itself.

581
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:13,280
That's the big thing for me, why I think this is such a good idea.

582
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:19,280
If I want to get further in these games, other than just walking around

583
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:21,280
and just doing a bunch of nothing,

584
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:25,280
I would have to get someone else to basically do it for me.

585
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:32,280
Sturlock, have you had games, a lot of games, where you hit that brick wall?

586
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:36,280
Yeah, because I'm big into RPGs.

587
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:41,280
Basically, I'm sort of restricted to just walking around

588
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:44,280
and finding random battles, which I like.

589
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:53,280
But if I want to progress in the story, not a whole lot I can do about that.

590
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:56,280
Well, Sturlock, I really appreciate the insight

591
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:59,280
and giving us another angle we may not have thought of otherwise.

592
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:01,280
So thank you very much, Sturlock, and you have a good one.

593
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:03,280
You too.

594
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:05,280
Definitely something I wouldn't have thought of before.

595
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:09,280
What about folks who might have something where they can't?

596
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:12,280
But maybe this speaks to a greater thing about making games

597
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:14,280
more handicap accessible to begin with,

598
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:17,280
and maybe this just isn't the way to do it. I don't know.

599
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:19,280
Then if that's the case, then how noble of Nintendo.

600
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:21,280
However, I don't think that's why they're doing it.

601
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:24,280
I would agree.

602
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:27,280
It's a perk for folks, but it's not the reason.

603
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:29,280
It's okay. We've made the games easier.

604
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:32,280
We've made the system that's more approachable for gamers

605
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:35,280
or people who have never played a game in their life before.

606
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:38,280
But the problem is still there's people out there

607
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:40,280
that they have not been able to capture yet

608
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:42,280
that aren't interested in the games, and they're trying to figure out,

609
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:43,280
why is that?

610
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:45,280
Oh, it must be that they're still too hard.

611
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:47,280
They're still too difficult.

612
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:51,280
Let's put this feature in that allows the game to play itself

613
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:53,280
in case they get stuck.

614
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:55,280
That's great, but you know what?

615
00:33:55,280 --> 00:34:01,280
Getting that feature out there to a consumer that's not playing games,

616
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:03,280
I'm pretty sure they're probably not up to date

617
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:06,280
on everything that's coming into a certain game.

618
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:09,280
They're probably not going to know about it anyways.

619
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:12,280
And it's really just a waste of time,

620
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:14,280
because I don't think it's really going to accomplish

621
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:16,280
what they're hoping that it will accomplish.

622
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:17,280
Let me read a few more things from chat,

623
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:19,280
and then we'll move on with some more stories tonight.

624
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:21,280
I wanted to read some of these comments.

625
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:23,280
Azure Edge in chat says,

626
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:25,280
I thought all of this was just when you pause,

627
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:27,280
a movie comes up showing you how to do it,

628
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:29,280
but when you resume the game, you start off where you were at.

629
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:31,280
And perhaps that was in the original trademark.

630
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:33,280
I would have no problems with that.

631
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:34,280
That's fine.

632
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:36,280
If they're giving you tips on how to play the game,

633
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:38,280
then yeah, that seems very fair,

634
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:40,280
because that way they're helping you along,

635
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:42,280
but you actually have to do it.

636
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:43,280
And I do encourage that.

637
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:46,280
Let me read that quote again from Miyamoto.

638
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:47,280
In New Super Mario Brothers Wii,

639
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:49,280
if a player is experiencing an area of difficulty,

640
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:51,280
this will allow them to clear troubled areas

641
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:53,280
and take over when they're ready.

642
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:54,280
So, very interesting.

643
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:55,280
So yeah, that does not sound...

644
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:56,280
Let's take one more call, because we've got another call.

645
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:59,280
Hi, you're on Ornson's Radio. Who's this?

646
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:00,280
This is Spazinator.

647
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:03,280
Hey Spazinator, quickly, is this a good idea or a bad idea,

648
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:05,280
the demo mode?

649
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:08,280
A bad idea.

650
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:11,280
For a couple reasons.

651
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:18,280
First, although Nintendo is not coming out and directly saying it,

652
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:23,280
they're kind of implying that gamers are stupid.

653
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:30,280
They have to handle gamers to get them to finish the game.

654
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:33,280
And you've got to remember,

655
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:36,280
at least back in the original NES game,

656
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:43,280
they were scared towards the kids.

657
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:46,280
They were playing really, really difficult games on there,

658
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:49,280
like Kid Icarus, for one.

659
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:53,280
Games like that were really difficult.

660
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:59,280
People loved those games, even though they were difficult.

661
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:04,280
And a lot of people take pride in the fact

662
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:07,280
that they played these really difficult games

663
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:11,280
and ended up beating them.

664
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:15,280
For me, I feel that if a game is too easy,

665
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:18,280
you tend to lose interest in it.

666
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:20,280
Thank you very much, Spazinator, for the input.

667
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:21,280
We're going to talk about this a little bit,

668
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:23,280
but I'm going to go ahead and let you go for now

669
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:25,280
when we move on to other topics.

670
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:28,280
Some of what Spazinator is saying,

671
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:31,280
he kind of compares to the older games,

672
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:33,280
and a lot of people are very fond of those games.

673
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:35,280
When I think about this easy mode,

674
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:37,280
yeah, it's making games more accessible

675
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:39,280
to 7-year-olds and 10-year-olds,

676
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:40,280
but then I think back,

677
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:41,280
okay, when I was 10 years old,

678
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:42,280
I was busting my way through Kid Icarus,

679
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:44,280
which was one of the hardest games ever.

680
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:45,280
But at the same time,

681
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:47,280
I don't think the classic Nintendo

682
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:49,280
has penetrated the marketplace

683
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:50,280
the same way the Wii has.

684
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:53,280
I mean, the Wii is just huge. Huge.

685
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:57,280
There's a lot of problems,

686
00:36:57,280 --> 00:37:00,280
and it's a lot of just stuff that right now,

687
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:01,280
it's society.

688
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:04,280
Basically, the games out here now,

689
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:05,280
if you're going to put out a lot of games

690
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:06,280
that you're trying to make accessible

691
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:07,280
for a 7-year-old,

692
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:10,280
and they're really super-duper easy,

693
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:13,280
yeah, you may get them interested in playing games

694
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:15,280
and they may think that they're all awesome

695
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:17,280
because they're able to finish these games,

696
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:18,280
but at the same time,

697
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:20,280
is that really making the 7-year-old a better gamer?

698
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:21,280
I mean, later on down the line,

699
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:23,280
are they going to be any better?

700
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:25,280
I think if you have to play a harder game

701
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:27,280
and you actually stick with it,

702
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:30,280
which is something we should be teaching our kids anyways,

703
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:31,280
sticking with something instead of,

704
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:33,280
oh, I can't do it, I quit.

705
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:37,280
I mean, that's really, I think, more important than anything

706
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:38,280
because then that way,

707
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:40,280
they learn to play the harder game,

708
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:43,280
they feel the accomplishment of finishing said hard game,

709
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:46,280
and then that makes them a better gamer overall.

710
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:47,280
All right, one more chat comment,

711
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:48,280
then we'll move on to the next story.

712
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:50,280
Deep Man in chat says,

713
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:52,280
also, I would probably use it when playing Zelda.

714
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:54,280
I love the series and the plot of the games,

715
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:56,280
but it just can't seem to focus.

716
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:58,280
But if I can progress quickly

717
00:37:58,280 --> 00:38:00,280
without breaking the flow of the story,

718
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:01,280
then please hook me up.

719
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:04,280
This could be an interesting perspective,

720
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:06,280
and this is, you know, again,

721
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:10,280
where I almost support this feature in games like Zelda.

722
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:12,280
I'm not sure how I feel about it in, like, a Mario game,

723
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:14,280
but an adventure game like Zelda,

724
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:16,280
jury's still out for me on this whole thing.

725
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:17,280
I can be swayed either way.

726
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:18,280
I need to see it in action.

727
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:20,280
But for the Zelda games, I kind of sympathize.

728
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:23,280
I am such a short attention span gamer sometimes

729
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:26,280
that sometimes I don't want the challenge.

730
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:27,280
I want that story.

731
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:29,280
I want to watch the whole thing unfold.

732
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:31,280
Do you know how many games sit on my shelf

733
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:32,280
that I haven't beat

734
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:35,280
because I quickly move from one game to the next?

735
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:36,280
Like, I don't know.

736
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:38,280
I wish there almost sometimes there was a way.

737
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:40,280
I could just go back and finish them all.

738
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:41,280
But I don't know.

739
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:43,280
And that's great, but I don't think New Super Mario Bros.

740
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:44,280
has a story.

741
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:46,280
I'm pretty sure it doesn't.

742
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:47,280
So there's really no point.

743
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:49,280
And on top of that,

744
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:52,280
stop trying to develop technology to demo actual games

745
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:55,280
and give us stupid demos, for God's sake.

746
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:58,280
Seriously, it'd be nice to have demos for, I don't know,

747
00:38:58,280 --> 00:39:01,280
Virtual Console, WiiWare, actual games.

748
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:03,280
That might be nice so I can know

749
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:05,280
if something's a stinker or not before I buy it.

750
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:06,280
Oh, that's right.

751
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:07,280
You wouldn't want that

752
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:09,280
because then there goes all your sales

753
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:11,280
when people realize that these games suck.

754
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:13,280
But just one more thing I wanted to throw out there

755
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:15,280
is that, again, in the whole adventure games,

756
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:17,280
when I get stuck, I go to gamefacts.com.

757
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:20,280
How much different is this

758
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:22,280
than having to look up the FAQ to get...

759
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:24,280
Like, for instance, playing Final Fantasy IV,

760
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:27,280
the after years, which was a game I continued on with this week.

761
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:29,280
You know, I got into this...

762
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:31,280
I was going through this one cave, the Devil's Road,

763
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:34,280
which is like, you know, you go from warp point to warp point,

764
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:37,280
and then you get in this one room that's like a giant maze,

765
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:40,280
and I was just like, God, I don't want to do another maze.

766
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:41,280
I want to get to a save point.

767
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:42,280
I want to go eat a burger

768
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:44,280
because that's just where I was at that point.

769
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:45,280
So you know what?

770
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:46,280
I loaded up Final Fantasy Wikia,

771
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:49,280
and there was a whole little map on how to get through that room,

772
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:51,280
and I just did it, and I was like, yay.

773
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:52,280
Exactly. That's fine.

774
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:55,280
That's okay, but see, you're not relying on...

775
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:57,280
I mean, to get you through a certain point,

776
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:59,280
it's just helping you out.

777
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:02,280
It's not saying, okay, you know, you need to do this,

778
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:04,280
or, you know, here, let me do this for you.

779
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:07,280
It's just saying, you know, here's what you need to do.

780
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:08,280
Go do it.

781
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:09,280
All right.

782
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:10,280
And that's fine.

783
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:12,280
That's just like saying, you know, hey, Rob,

784
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:13,280
I'm stuck in the Zelda game.

785
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:15,280
You've gotten past this point.

786
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:16,280
What am I supposed to do?

787
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:19,280
It's just like that, and there's no harm in that

788
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:21,280
because you're still having to do it.

789
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:22,280
It's just giving you a tip.

790
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:23,280
How often did you...

791
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:25,280
I know like many years ago, like in high school and stuff,

792
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:26,280
how often did you do that?

793
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:27,280
Like, your friend would be playing the game.

794
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:28,280
I can't get past this part.

795
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:29,280
Give me the controller.

796
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:30,280
Okay, there you go.

797
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:31,280
Exactly.

798
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:33,280
Why isn't Nintendo just bringing back the Nintendo tip line?

799
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:35,280
I mean, they can make more money that way.

800
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:36,280
Get some game counselors on staff.

801
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:37,280
There you go.

802
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:38,280
All right, let's move on with some more news.

803
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:39,280
All right.

804
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:43,280
Well, some other interesting stuff,

805
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:46,280
more in the music gaming platforms,

806
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:50,280
but we've got Neversoft talking about possibilities

807
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:54,280
of adding the DJ Hero turntable support

808
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:56,280
for future Guitar Hero games.

809
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:58,280
Now, that makes kind of sense if you think about it

810
00:40:58,280 --> 00:41:02,280
because Guitar Hero 5, really, they're pushing that,

811
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:04,280
hey, you can play in any band setup whatsoever,

812
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:09,280
if it be four drummers, three guitars a singer, whatever.

813
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:15,280
So maybe later on, they can add DJ support as well.

814
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:17,280
They said they would have liked to have worked it into

815
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:18,280
Guitar Hero 5.

816
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:21,280
Unfortunately, Guitar Hero 5 ships in a few months,

817
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:26,280
and it's a few months before the DJ Hero thing comes out,

818
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:29,280
so maybe later on, they'll add it in there.

819
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:31,280
But it says it sounds like a great idea.

820
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:35,280
I don't think it's a great idea.

821
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:38,280
I mean, I don't think they're going to do it,

822
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:40,280
but it sounds like a cool idea.

823
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:42,280
I think, if anything, if they're going to have that type of stuff,

824
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:46,280
it's just going to be maybe tracks that you can download on DJ Hero,

825
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:49,280
but I'll have the guitar and DJ element in there.

826
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:52,280
And if you have an opinion on this or any other story we're going through tonight,

827
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:55,280
1-877-GAME-OLR is the number to call,

828
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:57,280
or our chat room is chat.orangelaungeready.com.

829
00:41:57,280 --> 00:42:00,280
But this makes me think about, I was playing rock band this weekend.

830
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:03,280
You were over, we were checking out rock band,

831
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:07,280
and I don't have room for a turntable on top of all the other crap

832
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:11,280
that rock band, rock band, Guitar Hero, whatever,

833
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:12,280
same thing these days, right?

834
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:15,280
Well, not really, but same peripherals these days, right?

835
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:19,280
I don't have room for a turntable and somebody else to see the TV

836
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:21,280
on top of all that other stuff.

837
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:23,280
I mean, that is almost, in a way, like too much stuff.

838
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:26,280
I think it's one of those things, it's a nice idea in theory,

839
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:29,280
and it enhances the value of these peripherals

840
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:31,280
that we're dropping so much money on,

841
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:34,280
but then I also think, how many songs really are going to make use out of this?

842
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:39,280
How many turntable, rock hybrid songs can you think of?

843
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:42,280
Besides, like, Walk This Way by Aerosmith and Run DMC?

844
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:46,280
Well, there's a lot of, like, the Linkin Park stuff and stuff like that,

845
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:47,280
maybe Korn or something.

846
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:48,280
Okay, good point.

847
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:53,280
But, yeah, it's a minority of the songs that are out there,

848
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:55,280
and really, it's something I think that they would just support it

849
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:58,280
with more tracks that are available through DJ Hero.

850
00:42:58,280 --> 00:43:02,280
And because DJ Hero is really about mixing music together,

851
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:07,280
this would be more of kind of like adding a little triangle

852
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:10,280
or something like that to Guitar Hero.

853
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:14,280
It just, it wouldn't really be a big focus instrument for it

854
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:16,280
unless they really went and did something.

855
00:43:16,280 --> 00:43:18,280
At that point, why would you bother doing that?

856
00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:22,280
Because you can't, I don't know, it'd be a lot of support for a game

857
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:26,280
that they could just add more support to the existing DJ games

858
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:28,280
to just get people to buy that instead,

859
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:31,280
and there's no real point to have to support it anyways.

860
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:34,280
You know, I still say you're going to be so limited with this, though.

861
00:43:34,280 --> 00:43:38,280
Okay, on my rock band, I have rock band two, rock band one,

862
00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:41,280
and I've got to have at least 40 to 50 download songs.

863
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:43,280
I mean, I have a lot of download songs.

864
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:46,280
I've given that company a lot of money, but they've earned it.

865
00:43:46,280 --> 00:43:48,280
A lot of fun nights there with rock band.

866
00:43:48,280 --> 00:43:52,280
Sometimes, when I have friends come over to play the game,

867
00:43:52,280 --> 00:43:55,280
they get up ready to sing, they scroll through the list

868
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:57,280
and scroll and scroll and scroll and go,

869
00:43:57,280 --> 00:43:59,280
I can't really sing any of these songs.

870
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:03,280
And I don't know how you guys do it when you play rock band,

871
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:06,280
but I know that we let the singer always pick the song

872
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:08,280
because they've probably got the hardest role.

873
00:44:08,280 --> 00:44:12,280
You know, guitar is pretty much the same, and drums are pretty much the same,

874
00:44:12,280 --> 00:44:14,280
and I assume turntable would be pretty much the same

875
00:44:14,280 --> 00:44:17,280
no matter what song you're choosing, but it's always up to the vocalist.

876
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:20,280
And again, how much variety are you going to get

877
00:44:20,280 --> 00:44:24,280
if there's only like ten songs that are going to support the turntable and all this?

878
00:44:24,280 --> 00:44:27,280
It seems like, while it's a nice enhancement,

879
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:30,280
it seems like effort that could be better spent somewhere else.

880
00:44:30,280 --> 00:44:33,280
And the only thing I could see, here would be a good idea.

881
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:36,280
You would take a game, I don't think Guitar Hero is the right game for it,

882
00:44:36,280 --> 00:44:39,280
I think Band Hero would be the right game for it,

883
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:42,280
because Band Hero is going to be more pop music,

884
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:44,280
that has a lot more turntable stuff in it.

885
00:44:44,280 --> 00:44:46,280
Wait, there's actually a separate game called Band Hero?

886
00:44:46,280 --> 00:44:49,280
Yes there is, it's basically like Lego Rock Band,

887
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:51,280
because Lego Rock Band is going to be more pop music.

888
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:54,280
They had a demo, or they had a trailer for it at E3.

889
00:44:54,280 --> 00:44:57,280
I know, I remember seeing that trailer, I thought that...

890
00:44:57,280 --> 00:44:58,280
No, that's...

891
00:44:58,280 --> 00:45:00,280
Okay, call me stupid, laugh at me, I don't care,

892
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:03,280
but I thought that was kind of like Guitar Hero 5's name.

893
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:04,280
I thought it was the same thing.

894
00:45:04,280 --> 00:45:05,280
Nope.

895
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:06,280
I thought they were just finally admitting,

896
00:45:06,280 --> 00:45:08,280
oh hey, Guitar Hero is not really a guitar game anymore,

897
00:45:08,280 --> 00:45:09,280
so they're calling it Band Hero.

898
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:11,280
I thought it was Guitar Hero 5 Band Hero.

899
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:18,280
Band Hero now is basically the pop, easy, family-friendly game or whatever,

900
00:45:18,280 --> 00:45:20,280
and they're going to have bundles and fun stuff for that.

901
00:45:20,280 --> 00:45:22,280
But I think that would be more appropriate for Band Hero,

902
00:45:22,280 --> 00:45:27,280
because then you could say have a download thing that adds DJ support in,

903
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:33,280
if you have DJ Hero, or hey, if you want to be interesting with it, I guess,

904
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:36,280
and since they don't really sell the instruments by themselves at the turntables,

905
00:45:36,280 --> 00:45:39,280
maybe if you have a DJ Hero save file or something like that,

906
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:42,280
it detects it and it will allow you to play those games.

907
00:45:42,280 --> 00:45:48,280
Or maybe if you have, say, songs available,

908
00:45:48,280 --> 00:45:51,280
like download content or something that's Guitar Hero and DJs,

909
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:53,280
that you can play it in Band Hero.

910
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:54,280
Let me go to the phones.

911
00:45:54,280 --> 00:45:56,280
We have a call here on our Skype line.

912
00:45:56,280 --> 00:45:57,280
Hey, you're on Orange Lawn's radio.

913
00:45:57,280 --> 00:45:58,280
Who's this?

914
00:45:58,280 --> 00:45:59,280
Hey, it's Dan Shadow.

915
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:00,280
Hey, Dan Shadow.

916
00:46:00,280 --> 00:46:03,280
What do you think of this whole thing, the turntables in Guitar Hero

917
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:06,280
and Band Hero and all this?

918
00:46:06,280 --> 00:46:10,280
That wasn't really what I called it, but I just wanted to try it out.

919
00:46:10,280 --> 00:46:14,280
Isn't it the new Guitar Hero game, or was it Rock Band, Beatles,

920
00:46:14,280 --> 00:46:18,280
that lets you play multiple instruments in replacement of other instruments?

921
00:46:18,280 --> 00:46:20,280
That's like Guitar Hero 5.

922
00:46:20,280 --> 00:46:25,280
Yeah, because you were just mentioning the lead singer always rolls through

923
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:29,280
whatever song they want and then, you know, it's like they play guitar

924
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:32,280
and then no one wants to sing.

925
00:46:32,280 --> 00:46:35,280
I just think it's a good thing.

926
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:38,280
The call is cutting in a little in and out.

927
00:46:38,280 --> 00:46:41,280
I think we have a bad connection, but I kind of get the point there

928
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:46,280
that Guitar Hero 5 is kind of letting us do this more enhanced band thing

929
00:46:46,280 --> 00:46:48,280
where if nobody wants to sing, then great.

930
00:46:48,280 --> 00:46:50,280
We'll have two people play guitar.

931
00:46:50,280 --> 00:46:52,280
Of course, that's more peripherals.

932
00:46:52,280 --> 00:46:54,280
Hey, at this point you probably have enough.

933
00:46:54,280 --> 00:46:56,280
Yeah, tons of people own them at this point.

934
00:46:56,280 --> 00:46:58,280
You probably have enough, and hell, friends bring them over.

935
00:46:58,280 --> 00:47:00,280
I guess that's probably not going to be the problem.

936
00:47:00,280 --> 00:47:04,280
I can't see four drummers, but, you know, sure, why not?

937
00:47:04,280 --> 00:47:07,280
Yeah, I just wanted to chime in and say that's the biggest problem I have

938
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:10,280
when I play Rock Band is that everyone wants to play one song.

939
00:47:10,280 --> 00:47:12,280
The singer doesn't want to play this song or whatever.

940
00:47:12,280 --> 00:47:15,280
Well, that's what I wanted to chime in on.

941
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:17,280
Go ahead and keep on with your DJ conversation.

942
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:20,280
No, hey, no worries, and don't worry.

943
00:47:20,280 --> 00:47:22,280
We are experimenting with a new format tonight,

944
00:47:22,280 --> 00:47:24,280
so if you want to call in while we were talking about stories,

945
00:47:24,280 --> 00:47:28,280
it's perfectly okay if folks kind of want to go back a few steps within the story.

946
00:47:28,280 --> 00:47:30,280
As long as somebody doesn't call in to say,

947
00:47:30,280 --> 00:47:33,280
hey, I want to talk about Doom while we're talking about Guitar Hero,

948
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:35,280
we will have a space at the end of the show for folks

949
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:37,280
that want to call in on any topic in the open bar.

950
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:40,280
Thank you very much, Dan. Have a good night, okay?

951
00:47:40,280 --> 00:47:41,280
Have a good one, guys.

952
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:43,280
The other thing I think they should do also,

953
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:46,280
but I know they're not going to because they're going to exclude people that way,

954
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:48,280
is they should have songs that require, okay,

955
00:47:48,280 --> 00:47:51,280
this song has two drummers and a DJ in it or something like that.

956
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:54,280
Unique things. You can have the songs.

957
00:47:54,280 --> 00:47:58,280
Just like DJ Hero is doing, they're going to have ten songs

958
00:47:58,280 --> 00:48:00,280
that you can play guitar and DJ together.

959
00:48:00,280 --> 00:48:03,280
Well, let's have some songs that you can do,

960
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:08,280
like say a DJ and then maybe two drummers and a singer or something.

961
00:48:08,280 --> 00:48:10,280
Something really ridiculous.

962
00:48:10,280 --> 00:48:13,280
It seems a bit much, but I think you're going to see some of these challenge things

963
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:15,280
in Guitar Hero online.

964
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:19,280
Here's a challenge. Do this challenge with four guitar players or something like that.

965
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:21,280
I think that's where you're going to see something like that,

966
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:23,280
but hold songs just for that.

967
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:25,280
But all it really is is people playing together.

968
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:28,280
It's the same thing. It's not like they're actually playing different parts.

969
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:31,280
If you do four guitarists, unless someone picks bass,

970
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:33,280
it's just going to be the same notes coming down.

971
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:35,280
All right, TigerClaw in our chat.

972
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:38,280
chat.orangelaunchradio.com is saying quite a bit about this.

973
00:48:38,280 --> 00:48:42,280
Very curious about what the Armin van Buuren DJ game is going to be like,

974
00:48:42,280 --> 00:48:45,280
which was oddly silent at E3, as was Scratch,

975
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:48,280
although now we're starting to see videos of Scratch be released this week and more.

976
00:48:48,280 --> 00:48:50,280
I've already seen them.

977
00:48:50,280 --> 00:48:51,280
Very interesting.

978
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:54,280
I want to read this comment from TigerClaw at chat.orangelaunchradio.com.

979
00:48:54,280 --> 00:48:57,280
Adding guitars to a live DJ set or any other instruments

980
00:48:57,280 --> 00:48:59,280
would make the mixes sound more lively.

981
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:02,280
I've heard a couple of live DJ sets that have live violins,

982
00:49:02,280 --> 00:49:05,280
guitars, and all sorts of other instruments in the background,

983
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:08,280
usually when you hear a big trance tune accompanied by a guitar

984
00:49:08,280 --> 00:49:10,280
during a breakdown or a buildup.

985
00:49:10,280 --> 00:49:12,280
I think a violin in a music game would be awesome.

986
00:49:12,280 --> 00:49:17,280
But when I read that, isn't that more going the other way,

987
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:20,280
putting guitars in DJ Hero, which they're already talking about doing?

988
00:49:20,280 --> 00:49:22,280
Yes, and they are.

989
00:49:22,280 --> 00:49:26,280
I think that's a cool idea as well, but it's kind of the other way.

990
00:49:26,280 --> 00:49:30,280
It's putting guitars in DJ Hero because you're saying you're adding guitars.

991
00:49:30,280 --> 00:49:34,280
But, to be fair, a very interesting line that's being blurred.

992
00:49:34,280 --> 00:49:38,280
Would it be interesting if some of these songs were in both?

993
00:49:38,280 --> 00:49:40,280
That would be cool, and another cool thing would be

994
00:49:40,280 --> 00:49:44,280
you could have an option that there's ten songs in Guitar Hero 5

995
00:49:44,280 --> 00:49:47,280
that have DJ support on, so you all play as a band,

996
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:50,280
but at the same time, the DJ is remixing the song,

997
00:49:50,280 --> 00:49:53,280
just adding beats and stuff to it.

998
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:56,280
That would be kind of cool.

999
00:49:56,280 --> 00:49:59,280
Not something I think that they're going to do this time around,

1000
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:01,280
but it will be cool in the future.

1001
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:04,280
Sure, we're spending $120 on this game and a controller,

1002
00:50:04,280 --> 00:50:07,280
so I'd hope I'd be able to use it in as many things as possible.

1003
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:10,280
We have the time dilation dude in chat says,

1004
00:50:10,280 --> 00:50:12,280
again, we need more cowbell.

1005
00:50:12,280 --> 00:50:14,280
That's true, when are we just going to get cowbell in these games?

1006
00:50:14,280 --> 00:50:16,280
That's what we're waiting for.

1007
00:50:16,280 --> 00:50:18,280
WeMusic has cowbell.

1008
00:50:18,280 --> 00:50:21,280
Well, cowbell and that, but like in Rock Band and stuff like that

1009
00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:22,280
where you can play the cymbals.

1010
00:50:22,280 --> 00:50:25,280
Tambourine, sometimes it's a cowbell noise.

1011
00:50:25,280 --> 00:50:29,280
Yeah, they should actually have cowbell.

1012
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:32,280
Kay Levster in our chat asks, is DJ Hero really going to work?

1013
00:50:32,280 --> 00:50:34,280
I think it's going to be fun.

1014
00:50:34,280 --> 00:50:37,280
I think it's going to be a fun game too, and it looks a lot of fun from the previews.

1015
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:38,280
I already got my order in.

1016
00:50:38,280 --> 00:50:42,280
I mean, good thing, because I'm all about Rock Band.

1017
00:50:42,280 --> 00:50:44,280
When it comes down to Rock Band vs Guitar Hero,

1018
00:50:44,280 --> 00:50:46,280
right now I am totally in the Rock Band camp.

1019
00:50:46,280 --> 00:50:48,280
I think it's the superior game.

1020
00:50:48,280 --> 00:50:52,280
But, good thing for Activision, I'm highly interested by DJ Hero.

1021
00:50:52,280 --> 00:50:53,280
I think it could be a good thing.

1022
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:57,280
And that has nothing to do with my prior obsession about BeatMania 2DX.

1023
00:50:57,280 --> 00:51:00,280
If you're still saying, wait for the reviews, wait for the reviews.

1024
00:51:00,280 --> 00:51:02,280
When the reviews come in on this game,

1025
00:51:02,280 --> 00:51:06,280
if you see reviewers comparing DJ Hero to BeatMania 2DX,

1026
00:51:06,280 --> 00:51:08,280
they are morons.

1027
00:51:08,280 --> 00:51:10,280
The games look completely different,

1028
00:51:10,280 --> 00:51:14,280
unless, granted, they quantify it with what makes them very different,

1029
00:51:14,280 --> 00:51:16,280
because the games are very different.

1030
00:51:16,280 --> 00:51:19,280
If you want a game that's like BeatMania 2DX, you're going to play Scratch.

1031
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:23,280
I mean, because that game is 2DX with better scratching.

1032
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:24,280
That's all it really is.

1033
00:51:24,280 --> 00:51:26,280
And that's the kind of thing.

1034
00:51:26,280 --> 00:51:30,280
I want to play both, because DJ Hero is more about mixing music together,

1035
00:51:30,280 --> 00:51:35,280
which I like doing, and Scratch is more about scratching.

1036
00:51:35,280 --> 00:51:40,280
It's really got the ability to do different techniques and stuff in there,

1037
00:51:40,280 --> 00:51:42,280
and really kind of make the songs your own,

1038
00:51:42,280 --> 00:51:45,280
instead of just kind of following note charts and stuff like that.

1039
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:51,280
But, yeah, in the end, Scratch is basically 2DX with better scratching.

1040
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:54,280
And DJ Dark Knight in chat says, G4 will, just you watch.

1041
00:51:54,280 --> 00:51:55,280
Oh, I have no doubt.

1042
00:51:55,280 --> 00:51:57,280
That's especially who I'm targeting that statement as.

1043
00:51:57,280 --> 00:52:02,280
So if you're the person that writes the reviews that Morgan and Adam,

1044
00:52:02,280 --> 00:52:04,280
or whatever their names are, read on X-Play,

1045
00:52:04,280 --> 00:52:05,280
do not make that mistake.

1046
00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:09,280
Like they did when they reviewed BeatMania on the PlayStation 2

1047
00:52:09,280 --> 00:52:13,280
a couple years ago, saying it ripped off Guitar Hero.

1048
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:18,280
BeatMania's been around since 1997?

1049
00:52:18,280 --> 00:52:22,280
Guitar Hero's been around since 2005?

1050
00:52:22,280 --> 00:52:26,280
Well, if you need any evidence that it's really image first,

1051
00:52:26,280 --> 00:52:29,280
and then knowledge second on G4.

1052
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:32,280
One of the hosts, I don't even know of what show,

1053
00:52:32,280 --> 00:52:35,280
because I don't watch G4, but she's a Perian playboy,

1054
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:39,280
and she's promoting it on G4, so they get the cross-promotion there.

1055
00:52:39,280 --> 00:52:43,280
But just because she's a pretty face to look at, that's about it.

1056
00:52:43,280 --> 00:52:46,280
Well, remember, G4 is not a gaming network.

1057
00:52:46,280 --> 00:52:47,280
Not anymore?

1058
00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:49,280
Well, they haven't been for quite some time.

1059
00:52:49,280 --> 00:52:52,280
We just need to remember, they are a network that caters to boys

1060
00:52:52,280 --> 00:52:55,280
that have some gaming-related shows.

1061
00:52:55,280 --> 00:52:57,280
They make a big presence at E3.

1062
00:52:57,280 --> 00:53:00,280
I mean, they have their booth, and they run around and act goofy.

1063
00:53:00,280 --> 00:53:02,280
But you know what?

1064
00:53:02,280 --> 00:53:07,280
Sadly enough, I think Spike covers games better than G4.

1065
00:53:07,280 --> 00:53:10,280
Well, because Spike is for big boys, and G4 is for little boys.

1066
00:53:10,280 --> 00:53:12,280
Isn't that the way it's supposed to break down?

1067
00:53:12,280 --> 00:53:15,280
And boys who like reality TV, like cops and cheaters.

1068
00:53:15,280 --> 00:53:17,280
Not little boys, but you know what I mean?

1069
00:53:17,280 --> 00:53:21,280
It's more for the teen and 21-ish audience, you know what I mean?

1070
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:24,280
It's G4's for frat dudes.

1071
00:53:24,280 --> 00:53:25,280
That's what G4 is for.

1072
00:53:25,280 --> 00:53:27,280
G4 doesn't really know what kind of a network it is.

1073
00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:31,280
It's just experimenting to see what sticks is really what it is.

1074
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:33,280
Now, Deep Man says the E3 coverage is pretty good.

1075
00:53:33,280 --> 00:53:36,280
And I do know people that will watch G4's E3 coverage.

1076
00:53:36,280 --> 00:53:39,280
You know, and to be fair, they are like the only network

1077
00:53:39,280 --> 00:53:42,280
that's making a 24-7 practically presence at E3.

1078
00:53:42,280 --> 00:53:46,280
So I would actually almost agree, they probably do cover E3 better than anyone,

1079
00:53:46,280 --> 00:53:49,280
because they devote so much time to it, you know?

1080
00:53:49,280 --> 00:53:50,280
Yeah.

1081
00:53:50,280 --> 00:53:52,280
So, all right.

1082
00:53:52,280 --> 00:53:55,280
Xenocore in chat wants to clarify something, by the way.

1083
00:53:55,280 --> 00:53:57,280
It's Olivia Munn. I don't know how we got on the G4 tangent,

1084
00:53:57,280 --> 00:53:58,280
but it needs to stop.

1085
00:53:58,280 --> 00:53:59,280
Yeah.

1086
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:00,280
No, that's all right.

1087
00:54:00,280 --> 00:54:01,280
Just one last comment.

1088
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:04,280
Xenocore in chat says it's Olivia Munn, and she's not posing nude.

1089
00:54:04,280 --> 00:54:08,280
Half the otaku geeks in the world are going to experience nerd rage.

1090
00:54:08,280 --> 00:54:10,280
So, we'll see.

1091
00:54:10,280 --> 00:54:12,280
Well, here's, look, we were talking about, you know,

1092
00:54:12,280 --> 00:54:15,280
things we're really not interested in anymore.

1093
00:54:15,280 --> 00:54:19,280
This just makes me think Guitar Hero, think even less of Guitar Hero,

1094
00:54:19,280 --> 00:54:21,280
is Guitar Hero Van Halen.

1095
00:54:21,280 --> 00:54:25,280
Look, I mean no disrespect to Van Halen, who obviously is one of the great,

1096
00:54:25,280 --> 00:54:28,280
you know, a great, great band, even though they go through singers

1097
00:54:28,280 --> 00:54:30,280
like Toilet Paper.

1098
00:54:30,280 --> 00:54:34,280
The thing about Guitar Hero Van Halen is just that when I watch it,

1099
00:54:34,280 --> 00:54:37,280
and you could watch it at E3 if you knew where to look at Sony's booth,

1100
00:54:37,280 --> 00:54:39,280
as opposed to Activision's.

1101
00:54:39,280 --> 00:54:43,280
When you watch it, you just can hear the cash cow mooing

1102
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:44,280
when you're watching the game.

1103
00:54:44,280 --> 00:54:47,280
It's re-skinned Guitar Hero Metallica. It's all it is.

1104
00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:50,280
And some more stories about this game that are coming out this week,

1105
00:54:50,280 --> 00:54:52,280
just don't even make me feel that much better about it.

1106
00:54:52,280 --> 00:54:55,280
Rolling Stone made a report earlier this week saying that

1107
00:54:55,280 --> 00:54:59,280
apparently the game is exclusive to David Lee Roth as the lead singer.

1108
00:54:59,280 --> 00:55:02,280
So, if you're expecting to hear like Right Now or something else

1109
00:55:02,280 --> 00:55:04,280
out of the Sammy Hagar era, too bad.

1110
00:55:04,280 --> 00:55:07,280
It's exclusive to the David Lee Roth era, which, you know,

1111
00:55:07,280 --> 00:55:12,280
I'm sure many music fans would care to argue that Van Halen really was

1112
00:55:12,280 --> 00:55:15,280
David Lee Roth and everything after that was just, you know,

1113
00:55:15,280 --> 00:55:16,280
them trying to hold on.

1114
00:55:16,280 --> 00:55:21,280
But, I don't know. They had some decent songs with the other lead singers.

1115
00:55:21,280 --> 00:55:23,280
It kind of also makes you go,

1116
00:55:23,280 --> 00:55:27,280
okay, well, how long was David Lee Roth really with them?

1117
00:55:27,280 --> 00:55:30,280
So, where are they going to get all their songs from?

1118
00:55:30,280 --> 00:55:33,280
And sure enough, if you start to kind of look at the song list,

1119
00:55:33,280 --> 00:55:38,280
you know, while if you were a fan of Van Halen back in the 80s

1120
00:55:38,280 --> 00:55:41,280
and David Lee Roth was around, you're going to be happy.

1121
00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:47,280
There's, you know, a lot of room for those that have been following

1122
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:50,280
Van Halen later on, think the game could improve.

1123
00:55:50,280 --> 00:55:52,280
So, and yes, as Marissa in chat says,

1124
00:55:52,280 --> 00:55:54,280
it's Van Halen, not Van Hagar.

1125
00:55:54,280 --> 00:56:00,280
And that, by the way, is exactly what Activision was quoted saying at one point.

1126
00:56:00,280 --> 00:56:02,280
It's definitely Van Halen and not Van Hagar.

1127
00:56:02,280 --> 00:56:05,280
Interesting.

1128
00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:07,280
But I got to be honest.

1129
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:11,280
Again, I'm just, I'm not really an interesting guitar hero of Van Halen.

1130
00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:15,280
If I was a hardcore Van Halen fan, I'd be all over this game.

1131
00:56:15,280 --> 00:56:19,280
You know, just like, I don't expect probably any of our listeners bought Sing Star Abba,

1132
00:56:19,280 --> 00:56:24,280
but I did, because I like Abba, and I'm not ashamed to admit it.

1133
00:56:24,280 --> 00:56:28,280
But I'm probably, you know, again, Sing Star Abba probably, what was it?

1134
00:56:28,280 --> 00:56:31,280
It was just really a 25-song expansion pack for Sing Star.

1135
00:56:31,280 --> 00:56:33,280
There's not a damn thing new or special about it.

1136
00:56:33,280 --> 00:56:34,280
You know what I want?

1137
00:56:34,280 --> 00:56:36,280
They don't even pretend.

1138
00:56:36,280 --> 00:56:42,280
I want Guitar Hero Huey Lewis and the News.

1139
00:56:42,280 --> 00:56:44,280
That's some good music there.

1140
00:56:44,280 --> 00:56:46,280
How about Guitar Hero Rick Roll Edition?

1141
00:56:46,280 --> 00:56:48,280
There's really only one song to play in it.

1142
00:56:48,280 --> 00:56:50,280
That's what we're moments away from becoming.

1143
00:56:50,280 --> 00:56:54,280
Or Guitar Hero Kenny Loggins would be pretty cool, too.

1144
00:56:54,280 --> 00:56:55,280
I don't know.

1145
00:56:55,280 --> 00:56:56,280
All right.

1146
00:56:56,280 --> 00:56:57,280
Well, there you go.

1147
00:56:57,280 --> 00:57:01,280
Van Halen is, Guitar Hero Van Halen, not a game I'm very interested in in the future.

1148
00:57:01,280 --> 00:57:04,280
Or hell, I'd just settle for some download content with those artists.

1149
00:57:04,280 --> 00:57:06,280
I mean, that would be fine.

1150
00:57:06,280 --> 00:57:08,280
And that's another thing, too, with Guitar Hero.

1151
00:57:08,280 --> 00:57:15,280
I mean, I'm glad that they put out, you know, download content I think about every week.

1152
00:57:15,280 --> 00:57:16,280
I'm not really sure.

1153
00:57:16,280 --> 00:57:23,280
But a lot of these things could easily just be, I don't know, available for download.

1154
00:57:23,280 --> 00:57:28,280
It's just like Rock Band, where they do the full album downloads and stuff like that.

1155
00:57:28,280 --> 00:57:31,280
I mean, they could easily turn one of those into another game.

1156
00:57:31,280 --> 00:57:38,280
Hey, let's take a full album, or a couple full albums of somebody, and let's add some other artists that they may have played with.

1157
00:57:38,280 --> 00:57:40,280
And done. Game.

1158
00:57:40,280 --> 00:57:45,280
And that's how they basically get the Guitar Hero artist games.

1159
00:57:45,280 --> 00:57:47,280
But really, yeah.

1160
00:57:47,280 --> 00:57:51,280
Granted, there's the Beatles Rock Band, but that's completely different.

1161
00:57:51,280 --> 00:57:58,280
I mean, they changed up the whole style of it, and it's a different kind of type of gameplay.

1162
00:57:58,280 --> 00:58:03,280
And then there's also Lego Rock Band, which is a little bit kind of a whoring of the franchise.

1163
00:58:03,280 --> 00:58:07,280
But I mean, it is more family-friendly, and it does look completely different.

1164
00:58:07,280 --> 00:58:10,280
And they're going to have a different type of music in there.

1165
00:58:10,280 --> 00:58:11,280
But yeah, you know.

1166
00:58:11,280 --> 00:58:15,280
Have they said, and I, you know, this is probably even something we've covered on the show, but I'm just so out of it.

1167
00:58:15,280 --> 00:58:19,280
Lego Rock Band is independent of the, oh no, I remember this guy brought up.

1168
00:58:19,280 --> 00:58:21,280
Lego Rock Band's list, you can't import it into the other games, can you?

1169
00:58:21,280 --> 00:58:22,280
Nope, different publisher.

1170
00:58:22,280 --> 00:58:24,280
That's right, because all the, yeah, I remember this.

1171
00:58:24,280 --> 00:58:26,280
This came up last week.

1172
00:58:26,280 --> 00:58:28,280
But I don't know if I'm really interested in Lego Rock Band.

1173
00:58:28,280 --> 00:58:29,280
I don't think I am.

1174
00:58:29,280 --> 00:58:31,280
Beatles Rock Band, I'm all over that shit.

1175
00:58:31,280 --> 00:58:33,280
That game looked amazing.

1176
00:58:33,280 --> 00:58:35,280
And I'm not even a hardcore Beatles fan.

1177
00:58:35,280 --> 00:58:37,280
I don't even think I've ever owned a Beatles album.

1178
00:58:37,280 --> 00:58:42,280
I like to, you know, obviously I think John Lennon was a great man, as were, you know, all the Beatles.

1179
00:58:42,280 --> 00:58:44,280
And you know, especially they do a lot of great humanitarian work now.

1180
00:58:44,280 --> 00:58:49,280
They have timeless classics, and you know, you hear the songs, they're just so embedded in our culture.

1181
00:58:49,280 --> 00:58:55,280
You can't help but not, but the game just looked like, wow, this is not just a cheap re-skinning.

1182
00:58:55,280 --> 00:59:01,280
Somebody really sat down at a table and thought, okay, how do we make, like not just how do we slap the Beatles in this game,

1183
00:59:01,280 --> 00:59:05,280
but how do we make a game about the Beatles in this franchise?

1184
00:59:05,280 --> 00:59:07,280
That's what really kind of made that game special.

1185
00:59:07,280 --> 00:59:08,280
It's effort, it's level of effort.

1186
00:59:08,280 --> 00:59:12,280
It's not just, okay, we took out Metallica, put in Van Halen, done.

1187
00:59:12,280 --> 00:59:16,280
Whereas I think Lego Rock Band was, okay, let's just slap Legos in Rock Band.

1188
00:59:16,280 --> 00:59:17,280
Yes.

1189
00:59:17,280 --> 00:59:18,280
Make it a family friendly franchise.

1190
00:59:18,280 --> 00:59:21,280
That is about as much effort as, you know, the Guitar Hero Van Halen.

1191
00:59:21,280 --> 00:59:27,280
But you all give it to them because that's one game, that's not like Guitar Hero Metallica, Guitar Hero Smash Hits,

1192
00:59:27,280 --> 00:59:32,280
Guitar Hero Van Halen, Guitar Hero 5, Guitar Hero Band Hero.

1193
00:59:32,280 --> 00:59:33,280
Guitar Hero Aerosmith.

1194
00:59:33,280 --> 00:59:36,280
Guitar Hero Aerosmith, well that's, I'm talking about this year basically.

1195
00:59:36,280 --> 00:59:37,280
Oh, okay, sorry.

1196
00:59:37,280 --> 00:59:42,280
I mean, you know, Guitar Hero for the DS, which just came out, On Tour 3.

1197
00:59:42,280 --> 00:59:47,280
Guitar Hero, which you'll probably have an On Tour 4 by the time we get to November.

1198
00:59:47,280 --> 00:59:51,280
It's just, it's too much.

1199
00:59:51,280 --> 00:59:52,280
Too much in one year.

1200
00:59:52,280 --> 00:59:54,280
I mean, God, space this stuff out.

1201
00:59:54,280 --> 00:59:55,280
Add it as download content.

1202
00:59:55,280 --> 01:00:01,280
Thank you for, you know, allowing the World Tour downloads to be available in Guitar Hero 5.

1203
01:00:01,280 --> 01:00:10,280
Unfortunately, you can't import the whole Guitar Hero World Tour, you know, song list into Guitar Hero 5 like you can with Rock Band 1 and Rock Band 2.

1204
01:00:10,280 --> 01:00:19,280
And assuming that it all stays the same, Rock Band 3, which you just build one continuous big song list, which I think is a great idea.

1205
01:00:19,280 --> 01:00:21,280
Do you think we'll get Rock Band 3 next year?

1206
01:00:21,280 --> 01:00:22,280
Maybe.

1207
01:00:22,280 --> 01:00:30,280
I think we will get Rock Band 3 because they're going to do three-bar harmonies in Rock Band and they may add some different stuff into it.

1208
01:00:30,280 --> 01:00:31,280
Who knows?

1209
01:00:31,280 --> 01:00:32,280
But I think there will be a new one next year.

1210
01:00:32,280 --> 01:00:35,280
I'm still hoping for a keyboard someday, but I know, fat chance.

1211
01:00:35,280 --> 01:00:36,280
Fat chance.

1212
01:00:36,280 --> 01:00:39,280
Alright, we're about an hour into tonight's show, so let's move on.

1213
01:00:39,280 --> 01:00:42,280
We've still got a couple more stories to go over.

1214
01:00:42,280 --> 01:00:49,280
We have no idea how long tonight's show is going to take, by the way, with this whole new format, but we're right on about the same usual time right now.

1215
01:00:49,280 --> 01:00:52,280
We've got a few more stories we want to go over with you guys, though.

1216
01:00:52,280 --> 01:00:56,280
And remember, you can call in at any time 1-877-GAME-OLR.

1217
01:00:56,280 --> 01:01:00,280
We are going to get past Guitar Hero and Loki's going to take us in a different direction.

1218
01:01:00,280 --> 01:01:01,280
Yes.

1219
01:01:01,280 --> 01:01:03,280
Now we're going to talk about hardware.

1220
01:01:03,280 --> 01:01:11,280
You've probably heard a lot of game companies touting that their game has maxed out the hardware of the PS3 or the Xbox 360.

1221
01:01:11,280 --> 01:01:21,280
Well, according to Richard Parr, who works at Criterion, he's basically said the proof is that you're not the best.

1222
01:01:21,280 --> 01:01:24,280
Basically, it means that you're out of ideas.

1223
01:01:24,280 --> 01:01:27,280
You always find new ways to do things.

1224
01:01:27,280 --> 01:01:33,280
The constraints lift, not just with the new console generation, but with every game you do.

1225
01:01:33,280 --> 01:01:34,280
And I agree with him.

1226
01:01:34,280 --> 01:01:39,280
You look at games like Crysis that maxed out all the PCs out there, basically.

1227
01:01:39,280 --> 01:01:48,280
Just ridiculous stuff that you throw at it because you have three graphics cards in there, high-end processor, all the RAM you could possibly throw at it.

1228
01:01:48,280 --> 01:01:50,280
And it runs just kind of good.

1229
01:01:50,280 --> 01:01:52,280
Not great, but good.

1230
01:01:52,280 --> 01:01:53,280
And you know why?

1231
01:01:53,280 --> 01:01:56,280
It's because they didn't optimize their code for shit.

1232
01:01:56,280 --> 01:01:59,280
And then when Crysis Wars comes out, oh, look at that!

1233
01:01:59,280 --> 01:02:01,280
It's the same damn game, basically.

1234
01:02:01,280 --> 01:02:03,280
And it runs great on all these PCs.

1235
01:02:03,280 --> 01:02:04,280
Wonder why that was?

1236
01:02:04,280 --> 01:02:07,280
Oh, it's because we actually optimized our code this time.

1237
01:02:07,280 --> 01:02:23,280
So really, I think that they are able to push out more code, better detail, better processing power out of these games, just by the effort and tricks that they learned along the way.

1238
01:02:23,280 --> 01:02:36,280
Learn to optimize their code, learn to optimize their engines that they run in, and just kind of figure out ways to use every bit of the console's power.

1239
01:02:36,280 --> 01:02:43,280
You know, it's interesting because it's challenging people to kind of think within the constraints that you might already have.

1240
01:02:43,280 --> 01:02:45,280
You know, you've got to innovate with what you've already got.

1241
01:02:45,280 --> 01:02:51,280
It kind of makes me think about why do games still continue to come out for the Dreamcast and all this?

1242
01:02:51,280 --> 01:02:55,280
Because there's a big independence scene on the Dreamcast, not necessarily because they're putting out better games.

1243
01:02:55,280 --> 01:03:00,280
But I think a better example would be looking at what we're seeing this year for the Wii.

1244
01:03:00,280 --> 01:03:04,280
I mean, look at Red Steel 2.

1245
01:03:04,280 --> 01:03:06,280
I mean, Red Steel 2 looks awesome.

1246
01:03:06,280 --> 01:03:08,280
It runs at 60 frames per second.

1247
01:03:08,280 --> 01:03:10,280
The graphics are pretty great on it.

1248
01:03:10,280 --> 01:03:16,280
I mean, it looks like something that could probably be on a 360 or a PS3, but they're doing it on the Wii.

1249
01:03:16,280 --> 01:03:23,280
And before, you know, no one thought that that was possible, even with something like the Metroid Other M.

1250
01:03:23,280 --> 01:03:28,280
I mean, that looks like that could be easily on a 360 or something like that, at least from the videos I've seen.

1251
01:03:28,280 --> 01:03:31,280
And some of these other games look really good.

1252
01:03:31,280 --> 01:03:34,280
They're running at 60 frames per second and stuff like that on the Wii.

1253
01:03:34,280 --> 01:03:41,280
You know, a big one that was, I want to say, the Conduit.

1254
01:03:41,280 --> 01:03:46,280
The Conduit's another one that pushed the engine really well on the Wii.

1255
01:03:46,280 --> 01:03:47,280
And they said, oh yeah, we maxed it out.

1256
01:03:47,280 --> 01:03:53,280
But guess what? They came out with some better games now, other games that they're coming out after Conduit.

1257
01:03:53,280 --> 01:03:56,280
And they're even better.

1258
01:03:56,280 --> 01:04:01,280
Well, you mentioning Metroid made me think of F-Zero on the GameCube, and I love F-Zero.

1259
01:04:01,280 --> 01:04:05,280
I think that was just an awesome game, especially that particular one that was on the GameCube.

1260
01:04:05,280 --> 01:04:10,280
And it looked great, and at the time did something that was almost unheard of on the GameCube.

1261
01:04:10,280 --> 01:04:16,280
It supported widescreen 480 progression, the same resolution that the Wii does.

1262
01:04:16,280 --> 01:04:21,280
Yet, I see so many Wii games that don't look as good as F-Zero GX did.

1263
01:04:21,280 --> 01:04:23,280
PlayStation 2, there was Gran Turismo 4.

1264
01:04:23,280 --> 01:04:28,280
It supported 1080i on the PlayStation 2.

1265
01:04:28,280 --> 01:04:31,280
Wow, I didn't even realize that.

1266
01:04:31,280 --> 01:04:37,280
Who's to say that these consoles, who's to say that you couldn't develop a Wii game that could support those higher resolutions?

1267
01:04:37,280 --> 01:04:43,280
They could do it. I mean, hell, if a PlayStation 2 can do it, why can't the Wii? It's got better specs in it.

1268
01:04:43,280 --> 01:04:47,280
Well, maybe, well, for one, the Wii has no HDMI, but I guess they do have that particular output.

1269
01:04:47,280 --> 01:04:49,280
It doesn't matter. They have component out.

1270
01:04:49,280 --> 01:04:50,280
Interesting. I don't know.

1271
01:04:50,280 --> 01:04:54,280
You could do 1080p over component. Or just do 1080i. Or even, let's just, naive...

1272
01:04:54,280 --> 01:04:58,280
I don't know enough about the tech end to really know. Is there something within the hardware that has to enable it?

1273
01:04:58,280 --> 01:05:09,280
It's memory bandwidth. Basically, you're limited to the memory, the video memory, and the video processor for those consoles to be able to push out textures and stuff like that.

1274
01:05:09,280 --> 01:05:12,280
But I think maybe 720p, maybe that's doable.

1275
01:05:12,280 --> 01:05:18,280
And if you want to call us on this topic about consoles pushing their limits, do they still have a ways to go or what have you?

1276
01:05:18,280 --> 01:05:22,280
1877 game OLR is the number to call. Or chat.org.

1277
01:05:22,280 --> 01:05:32,280
Or you can do better resolution, like 720p, but maybe Letterbox is down some so that it's not using as much RAM, maybe.

1278
01:05:32,280 --> 01:05:36,280
Just black bars on top and bottom or something like that.

1279
01:05:36,280 --> 01:05:43,280
But maybe a hybrid resolution, like 540p or something weird. I don't know. Maybe that's possible.

1280
01:05:43,280 --> 01:05:52,280
Tigerclaw in chat says, you can do 1080p over component if the TV supports it. Most TV won't allow 1080p over component because it doesn't support HDCP.

1281
01:05:52,280 --> 01:05:58,280
That's fine. But let's just do 720p then, for argument's sake. Because 720 still looks great.

1282
01:05:58,280 --> 01:06:07,280
It's interesting because a lot of these, you gotta be careful too. There's a lot of cheap HDTVs out there. They're only capable of 720. They don't even do the 1080 at all.

1283
01:06:07,280 --> 01:06:15,280
But yeah, 720 is still considered HD. Right? So what's to say you can't do 720 on the Wii?

1284
01:06:15,280 --> 01:06:17,280
It'd be interesting if that's possible.

1285
01:06:17,280 --> 01:06:24,280
It's really just forward thinking and I don't think that they're gonna do that because, guess what, they think that their audience doesn't care.

1286
01:06:24,280 --> 01:06:31,280
And that's sad because they could do that and they could push the technology to maybe do that.

1287
01:06:31,280 --> 01:06:41,280
And this one comment here is gonna take this conversation in a different direction. Watch this. Gameguru in chat says, graphical power is overrated.

1288
01:06:41,280 --> 01:06:50,280
Yes, Wii's new AV port has four connections that aren't used. But go back to, graphical power is overrated. Isn't that what this is really all about in a way though?

1289
01:06:50,280 --> 01:06:57,280
Is that, do you really have to have the most cutting edge? Do we even really need this talk about HD on the Wii and all this stuff?

1290
01:06:57,280 --> 01:07:00,280
Shouldn't we just have the fun game?

1291
01:07:00,280 --> 01:07:04,280
True, but that's also how they're getting around some of this stuff too.

1292
01:07:04,280 --> 01:07:12,280
Because you'll notice, like Mad World, full 3D game, ran pretty good. Black and white, that's the way they got around.

1293
01:07:12,280 --> 01:07:17,280
It's a different art style so they didn't have to push the detail and stuff like that.

1294
01:07:17,280 --> 01:07:21,280
Red Steel 2, they're going with a comic book or maybe cel shaded look to it.

1295
01:07:21,280 --> 01:07:28,280
Another way that they've gotten around having to have really detailed textures and stuff like that, you save on texture memory that way.

1296
01:07:28,280 --> 01:07:31,280
I was thinking more like, games don't have to have great graphics to be fun.

1297
01:07:31,280 --> 01:07:37,280
They don't, but you should be able to do that if you're a developer and you want to push that out.

1298
01:07:37,280 --> 01:07:43,280
For real, how many fucking people are playing that Plants vs. Zombies game from PopCap right now?

1299
01:07:43,280 --> 01:07:44,280
Too many.

1300
01:07:44,280 --> 01:07:51,280
Billions and billions of people are playing that Plants vs. Zombies, creating zombies, that game is.

1301
01:07:51,280 --> 01:07:57,280
Not the greatest graphics in the world, a game that probably could have come out on the Super Nintendo, right?

1302
01:07:57,280 --> 01:07:58,280
Yes.

1303
01:07:58,280 --> 01:08:04,280
But, huge. And it adapts to so many different types of audiences too.

1304
01:08:04,280 --> 01:08:12,280
You know what I mean? Soccer moms play this on their break at work and even some of the hardcore gamers are all about plants and zombies.

1305
01:08:12,280 --> 01:08:18,280
When we went to that Windows 7 demo thingy at E3 that was off site, you know what one of those guys was testing out on the computer?

1306
01:08:18,280 --> 01:08:20,280
Plants vs. Zombies.

1307
01:08:20,280 --> 01:08:27,280
Yeah, exactly. And you know what would be funny, and I've always been saying this, why can't they take the Wii and say, give us a 2D Metroid?

1308
01:08:27,280 --> 01:08:32,280
Just, you know, that way you don't even have to worry about it, you know? Hell, you could reuse the sprites.

1309
01:08:32,280 --> 01:08:36,280
Just make a 2D Metroid that knocks me on my fucking ass. Like, really.

1310
01:08:36,280 --> 01:08:44,280
Just blow me away with the sound, the story, do beautiful Joey things with the 2D graphics, I don't know, whatever.

1311
01:08:44,280 --> 01:08:50,280
The one game I've been playing this week more than any other is Final Fantasy IV The After Years.

1312
01:08:50,280 --> 01:08:53,280
The graphics on par with Super Nintendo.

1313
01:08:53,280 --> 01:08:54,280
Yeah.

1314
01:08:54,280 --> 01:09:03,280
But, I'm very interested in the story. Now granted, a lot of this is because I love Final Fantasy IV and I'm very nostalgic for it, so to have the story keep going is great.

1315
01:09:03,280 --> 01:09:11,280
It's great though, because think about it though, if you did that with the Wii, you could actually reuse assets. You saved development time right there.

1316
01:09:11,280 --> 01:09:19,280
I mean, you can reuse assets, you can create new things, but you can just, you know, build upon it. Remember Sammit, what was it, Metroid Zero or whatever?

1317
01:09:19,280 --> 01:09:21,280
Zero Mission, I believe.

1318
01:09:21,280 --> 01:09:27,280
You know, basically Super Metroid, there is some differences in there, but then there is this whole after part.

1319
01:09:27,280 --> 01:09:30,280
I want to read this lengthy comment from Xenocore because I think it's a good one.

1320
01:09:30,280 --> 01:09:35,280
As much as this guy may have a point, this quote has merit, but only as far as what the rest of the game is doing.

1321
01:09:35,280 --> 01:09:41,280
This console has been maxed if you consider what else the console is doing while it's rendering graphics.

1322
01:09:41,280 --> 01:09:48,280
If a game isn't as intensive in driving AI or keeping objects in memory, fighters have more room for graphics than a simulation does.

1323
01:09:48,280 --> 01:09:53,280
Chat.orangelandraday.com if you want to comment. Or 1877 game OLR.

1324
01:09:53,280 --> 01:09:59,280
That's true. It doesn't. I mean, you could have, it's all how they use it. All the different tricks.

1325
01:09:59,280 --> 01:10:05,280
I like this comment from Dan Shadow. Who cares about graphics when Scribblenauts is coming?

1326
01:10:05,280 --> 01:10:09,280
That's true. Scribblenauts is going to be awesome. How are they going to do a sequel to that game?

1327
01:10:09,280 --> 01:10:16,280
I don't know. Hey, make a game like that on Xbox or something where when you put in bacon, it's real bacon.

1328
01:10:16,280 --> 01:10:20,280
It doesn't look like cartoony bacon, but real bacon.

1329
01:10:20,280 --> 01:10:22,280
Wishful thinking?

1330
01:10:22,280 --> 01:10:28,280
Too bad they couldn't do like a fighting game like that. Where you're just fighting and all of a sudden you just summon different things.

1331
01:10:28,280 --> 01:10:34,280
You know what though? I got to admit, as much as the Scribblenauts demo made me teehee when I was watching it at E3,

1332
01:10:34,280 --> 01:10:41,280
I do remain a little skeptical about how fun it's really going to be. Like the longevity is what I remain skeptical about.

1333
01:10:41,280 --> 01:10:50,280
You got to remember folks, remember, go back in the archives of this show back to 2006, I think.

1334
01:10:50,280 --> 01:10:57,280
I said Nintendogs was the best thing I played at E3. It's going to be the most amazing game when it comes out.

1335
01:10:57,280 --> 01:11:03,280
It's going to be awesome. Just all these things you can do is just going to be amazing. Nintendogs is going to blow away your fucking mind.

1336
01:11:03,280 --> 01:11:10,280
And then when the game came out, bored now, two hours in. Like it was the type of game where I'd seen it all at E3.

1337
01:11:10,280 --> 01:11:16,280
So I just, you know, I'm not, I haven't played Scribblenauts. I'm not saying knocking it. I'm just saying, skeptical.

1338
01:11:16,280 --> 01:11:21,280
For me, drawing the life. Another perfect one. Oh, I can draw my character? That's awesome.

1339
01:11:21,280 --> 01:11:30,280
Did that, and got bored. Same developer even. But this I think will be fun, if not just the show to your friends.

1340
01:11:30,280 --> 01:11:34,280
Hey, look at that, huh, Cthulhu. You know, just screwing around with that. And hey, why not?

1341
01:11:34,280 --> 01:11:41,280
You know, they should have a game that's just like a sandbox type thing where you can just create your own scenarios, you know, do whatever.

1342
01:11:41,280 --> 01:11:50,280
Bandit in our chatroom asks, why is the Wii $99 for God's sake? Good question. Or why, I'm sorry, why isn't the Wii? Sorry, my bad.

1343
01:11:50,280 --> 01:11:55,280
Why isn't the Wii $99 for God's sake? Because they want to make money off of every console.

1344
01:11:55,280 --> 01:12:02,280
Yeah, I mean, because people are still buying it when it's $250. Because they're ignorant, because they think that they can, you know,

1345
01:12:02,280 --> 01:12:15,280
I mean, look at that. The Xbox 360 is $50 cheaper than them. But you know what? They're so arrogant, I guess, and confident in their system that they just say, eh, whatever.

1346
01:12:15,280 --> 01:12:22,280
We're not competing with anybody. We're not part of the next gen, remember that quote? They're not part of the next gen.

1347
01:12:22,280 --> 01:12:28,280
We're a different gen. But no, it really comes down to because the game is still selling. That's the reason why.

1348
01:12:28,280 --> 01:12:36,280
Alright, let's move on. We have a lot of ground to cover before we get to break here. And this next story is about the Xbox 360's Project Natal,

1349
01:12:36,280 --> 01:12:44,280
which obviously was one of the highly talked about things that you three this year. The rumor going around this week is that Xbox Natal might actually be

1350
01:12:44,280 --> 01:12:55,280
the next Microsoft console. It might not be something that you buy to enhance with your 360, but it might actually be a whole new type of console.

1351
01:12:55,280 --> 01:13:02,280
Where does this come from? Well, this comes from a story reported on OneUp.com through their Listen Up podcast.

1352
01:13:02,280 --> 01:13:12,280
They were talking about Project Natal and some of the folks were talking about the games. And apparently, Microsoft is not only planning on releasing Natal as an add-on for the Xbox 360,

1353
01:13:12,280 --> 01:13:20,280
but possibly releasing it as standard with the next Xbox console. But they're saying this new console is not just going to be, like it's not a repackaging.

1354
01:13:20,280 --> 01:13:28,280
It's not a new SKU. It's not the power set that comes with more than just the thing itself.

1355
01:13:28,280 --> 01:13:39,280
But that they're talking about that this new Xbox could actually be called Xbox Natal and that it's going to be having some added oomph actually in the system itself.

1356
01:13:39,280 --> 01:13:48,280
You see rumors going around about how Xbox is going to have these new chipsets in them soon that apparently they're not going to be making as much noise.

1357
01:13:48,280 --> 01:13:56,280
They're combining the GPU and all this into one chipset so that it won't be as noisy and they can make the size go down a little bit.

1358
01:13:56,280 --> 01:14:01,280
So that maybe the Xbox 360 Slim is actually going to be this whole new console.

1359
01:14:01,280 --> 01:14:09,280
Loki, what do you think? I mean, it makes sense that they might redesign the console to be smaller. I don't think it's going to be the next console though.

1360
01:14:09,280 --> 01:14:16,280
I don't think they're going to increase the specs on it or anything because they can't because they would alienate half their audience basically.

1361
01:14:16,280 --> 01:14:26,280
I do think that maybe later on if this takes off like they think it's going to take off, then yeah, it probably will be bundled with all the Xbox 360 consoles as they come out.

1362
01:14:26,280 --> 01:14:33,280
It'll be just like a controller. I mean, that sounds right. I think a lot of people are getting caught off guard with the whole,

1363
01:14:33,280 --> 01:14:38,280
we're going to treat the Natal launch like we're going to treat a console launch.

1364
01:14:38,280 --> 01:14:40,280
That they're going to put a lot of marketing buzz behind it.

1365
01:14:40,280 --> 01:14:47,280
Yeah, it kind of is a big thing because if it does exactly what it's showing that it's supposed to be able to do, then yeah, that is a big thing.

1366
01:14:47,280 --> 01:14:52,280
That might get a lot of people interested and they really want to take away that market share that the Wii has.

1367
01:14:52,280 --> 01:14:59,280
And maybe possibly capture some of these people that have never played games before because that's what kind of the Wii did.

1368
01:14:59,280 --> 01:15:05,280
It's like, oh my god, I can play tennis like I can play tennis. Or I can bowl like I can really bowl.

1369
01:15:05,280 --> 01:15:11,280
But this is like, I can bowl and I don't need the whole controller. I don't even need to figure that out. I just do it.

1370
01:15:11,280 --> 01:15:15,280
Well now, here's something else to consider where they're going with this.

1371
01:15:15,280 --> 01:15:21,280
Why has the Wii been so successful? Because they've been catering to the soccer moms, to the family audience.

1372
01:15:21,280 --> 01:15:28,280
Now, there are rumors out there, and I say believe them, that Nintendo's coming out with a new Wii in 2011.

1373
01:15:28,280 --> 01:15:32,280
Wii HD. There's rumors about behind closed doors, showing to companies, and so on.

1374
01:15:32,280 --> 01:15:36,280
And I say believe them. Nintendo's the one that's got some catching up to do.

1375
01:15:36,280 --> 01:15:43,280
You know, if they don't think two steps ahead, they're going to get blown away by some of these new developments in the 360, especially with the 360's price point.

1376
01:15:43,280 --> 01:15:52,280
And here's the thing is that, let's say 360 relaunches this thing, and now they sell a slim Xbox that has Natal in it,

1377
01:15:52,280 --> 01:16:00,280
that is catered at a family audience, at a lower price point possibly, or an equal price point with the Nintendo Wii.

1378
01:16:00,280 --> 01:16:10,280
Now Nintendo's in trouble. So I think it's very interesting, you know, obviously, Microsoft is not content with being number two, or whatever they are right now.

1379
01:16:10,280 --> 01:16:15,280
I mean, I guess it's arguable, you look at the world picture, whatever. They are not, but they're not in America.

1380
01:16:15,280 --> 01:16:16,280
In the world.

1381
01:16:16,280 --> 01:16:17,280
Are they really?

1382
01:16:17,280 --> 01:16:18,280
Yeah.

1383
01:16:18,280 --> 01:16:19,280
But like Japan, they're certainly not.

1384
01:16:19,280 --> 01:16:22,280
Well yeah, but you know, that doesn't matter, their market share is really small.

1385
01:16:22,280 --> 01:16:29,280
Okay, well whatever, I don't want to get into, this isn't about 360 versus Sony right now, this is about Microsoft wanting to be number one.

1386
01:16:29,280 --> 01:16:37,280
And they're looking at how did Nintendo do it, and watch, when this thing launches, this is tall, it's going to be launched at families again.

1387
01:16:37,280 --> 01:16:44,280
But it's going to be interesting, because now they will still have that whole hardcore gamer, whereas Wii's going to be going in reverse.

1388
01:16:44,280 --> 01:16:49,280
They'll already probably have the buy-in from the family audience, they're going to need to get the hardcore gamers back on board.

1389
01:16:49,280 --> 01:16:56,280
That's really going to be tough, because I think Microsoft gets it though, because if you think about it, look at what they're showing off.

1390
01:16:56,280 --> 01:17:00,280
All the games that they're showing off are really to their core audience that's already there.

1391
01:17:00,280 --> 01:17:06,280
Games that everybody that I think owns the 360, for the most part, that's going to be something that you're going to be excited about.

1392
01:17:06,280 --> 01:17:11,280
Now, Natal is really kind of just to gather those people that may be on the Wii and stuff.

1393
01:17:11,280 --> 01:17:24,280
But the Wii, everybody that owns it, I mean granted there's games that you're looking forward to, but I know myself, I'm not going to be, other than Metroid, other M, and that's kind of iffy on that one.

1394
01:17:24,280 --> 01:17:29,280
I don't have faith in them that they're going to really put out something that's going to make me go,

1395
01:17:29,280 --> 01:17:40,280
Oh my god, this is so awesome, this is the greatest game I have ever played, you know, type thing. I think they're just going to keep churning this crap that's been coming out year after year.

1396
01:17:40,280 --> 01:17:48,280
Aimed at more family gamers, and good for them if they think that's what they need to do, but as far as my budget goes, I'm not spending money on this.

1397
01:17:48,280 --> 01:17:57,280
So much in chat I want to cover right now. Chat.orensonsheridge.com, and if you want to call in, please do 1-877-GAMEOLR if you want to talk about Project Natal and this whole rumor about the new system.

1398
01:17:57,280 --> 01:18:08,280
Oh god, where to even begin here, there's so much I want to talk about. First off, folks in chat say, Wii HD next year, no no no, 2011 is when they're saying it's coming out.

1399
01:18:08,280 --> 01:18:13,280
But Game Guru in chat says, no I don't see Wii HD coming out until the next generation.

1400
01:18:13,280 --> 01:18:17,280
But what I want to say to that is, who's to say where the generations are anymore?

1401
01:18:17,280 --> 01:18:29,280
I mean, what's interesting about what we've got with this current crop of systems is that they are entertainment devices in your living room, especially PlayStation 3.

1402
01:18:29,280 --> 01:18:36,280
You know, their biggest thing right now is the fact that it's a Blu-Ray player, and does a lot of these things right out of the living room.

1403
01:18:36,280 --> 01:18:41,280
You know, who's to say where the next generation is even going to begin?

1404
01:18:41,280 --> 01:18:54,280
Because we have yet to really max out this generation in some ways, but I don't know if there's necessarily going to be a hard line that defines the next generation of gaming after this one, I guess is what I'm getting at.

1405
01:18:54,280 --> 01:18:59,280
Because right now the war is about enhancing this current one, which we didn't really have before.

1406
01:18:59,280 --> 01:19:04,280
You know, when you had a Super Nintendo, you might have the occasional peripheral to enhance it, but that's it.

1407
01:19:04,280 --> 01:19:11,280
It's basically now they're trying to push their consoles to a 10-year life cycle, is really what it is.

1408
01:19:11,280 --> 01:19:16,280
And if that's the case, then we're going to be playing with the Xbox 360 until 2015.

1409
01:19:16,280 --> 01:19:27,280
So, you know, they've got to do something now because they're not necessarily running out of ideas, but they need to expand the possibilities with these new platforms.

1410
01:19:27,280 --> 01:19:35,280
So you're going to see stuff like the motion controllers coming out from Sony and from Microsoft, and you're going to see the enhancements to the console from the Wii.

1411
01:19:35,280 --> 01:19:42,280
Because it's technically not a new system, it's just an enhancement, like the DS and the DSi and the DS Lite.

1412
01:19:42,280 --> 01:19:45,280
Okay, I got to say this, I got to say this, because this is it right here.

1413
01:19:45,280 --> 01:19:51,280
GameGuru says, admittedly, it might be the next generation with MotionPlus, Natal, and PSMote.

1414
01:19:51,280 --> 01:19:57,280
And I'm almost on board with you there, but change MotionPlus to Wii HD, and there you have it.

1415
01:19:57,280 --> 01:20:00,280
That's why I do think Wii HD is out sooner than later.

1416
01:20:00,280 --> 01:20:02,280
What is this all about? Leveling the playfield.

1417
01:20:02,280 --> 01:20:06,280
Xbox, Sony will now have motion control.

1418
01:20:06,280 --> 01:20:08,280
Wii will now have high definition.

1419
01:20:08,280 --> 01:20:11,280
Now it's a war.

1420
01:20:11,280 --> 01:20:13,280
Now it's a war.

1421
01:20:13,280 --> 01:20:22,280
GameGuru also says in chat, and I'm sorry to keep quoting from the same person, but just a lot of thought-provoking comments, so props to you.

1422
01:20:22,280 --> 01:20:25,280
However, a price drop is due by 2010.

1423
01:20:25,280 --> 01:20:29,280
Natal will bomb with the Family Gamer, Xbox has its stereotype.

1424
01:20:29,280 --> 01:20:31,280
I couldn't disagree more.

1425
01:20:31,280 --> 01:20:34,280
Not necessarily that Natal will bomb with the Family Gamer, I don't know yet.

1426
01:20:34,280 --> 01:20:37,280
It's too early to see until we start really seeing the games.

1427
01:20:37,280 --> 01:20:41,280
You can't base everything off the Milo demo and some of these limited things we saw.

1428
01:20:41,280 --> 01:20:44,280
But Xbox having a stereotype to overcome, they can do it.

1429
01:20:44,280 --> 01:20:46,280
Hell yeah, they can do it.

1430
01:20:46,280 --> 01:20:48,280
And I'm not trying to sound like a fanboy or anything.

1431
01:20:48,280 --> 01:20:50,280
I'm saying, you go back.

1432
01:20:50,280 --> 01:20:54,280
The nice thing about this show being around for seven years, you go back to some of those older episodes.

1433
01:20:54,280 --> 01:20:56,280
My God, did we make fun of the Xbox.

1434
01:20:56,280 --> 01:20:58,280
Oh my God, the X-Brick.

1435
01:20:58,280 --> 01:21:00,280
What a fat system.

1436
01:21:00,280 --> 01:21:01,280
What a useless system.

1437
01:21:01,280 --> 01:21:03,280
There isn't a fucking game on it I want to play.

1438
01:21:03,280 --> 01:21:04,280
This is a piece of shit.

1439
01:21:04,280 --> 01:21:06,280
Who wants to buy this console?

1440
01:21:06,280 --> 01:21:08,280
This is just a PC in a box.

1441
01:21:08,280 --> 01:21:10,280
There's not a damn thing on this worth playing.

1442
01:21:10,280 --> 01:21:17,280
These are things that I'm sure we all said about that original, black, gigantic Xbox One.

1443
01:21:17,280 --> 01:21:19,280
But look how far they've come.

1444
01:21:19,280 --> 01:21:21,280
They won me over.

1445
01:21:21,280 --> 01:21:26,280
One of the games I played this week, which I didn't even get to in my gaming week, One vs. 100.

1446
01:21:26,280 --> 01:21:30,280
Which, I don't know how much I've ranted on this show before.

1447
01:21:30,280 --> 01:21:36,280
I want to see those Berkeley Systems games make a comeback, like Acrophobia and some of these other games used to be on Berkeley Systems.

1448
01:21:36,280 --> 01:21:37,280
That's what this is.

1449
01:21:37,280 --> 01:21:39,280
One vs. 100 is the Berkeley Systems games.

1450
01:21:39,280 --> 01:21:41,280
That's exactly what it is.

1451
01:21:41,280 --> 01:21:44,280
That's what I felt when I was playing it and everything.

1452
01:21:44,280 --> 01:21:46,280
That's exactly what it is.

1453
01:21:46,280 --> 01:21:48,280
Somebody at Microsoft is listening to this show or is thinking.

1454
01:21:48,280 --> 01:21:50,280
Or we share the same genes.

1455
01:21:50,280 --> 01:21:53,280
Because that is exactly what One vs. 100 is.

1456
01:21:53,280 --> 01:21:55,280
But it's like that in the next generation.

1457
01:21:55,280 --> 01:21:57,280
But see, that's the thing.

1458
01:21:57,280 --> 01:22:03,280
Microsoft, they're really not going to have much to overcome because they've got something for everybody.

1459
01:22:03,280 --> 01:22:12,280
They've got now these community games, One vs. 100 and stuff like that that's going to appeal to people that like watching game shows and stuff like that.

1460
01:22:12,280 --> 01:22:17,280
Hey, do you think maybe they might try marketing that to elderly people that like watching game shows?

1461
01:22:17,280 --> 01:22:19,280
Hey, now you can be on your favorite game show.

1462
01:22:19,280 --> 01:22:22,280
Wheel of Fortune, oh my god, that's going to totally be one of you.

1463
01:22:22,280 --> 01:22:25,280
It's not going to end with One vs. 100, by the way.

1464
01:22:25,280 --> 01:22:26,280
Here's my prediction.

1465
01:22:26,280 --> 01:22:28,280
I'm throwing this out here right now.

1466
01:22:28,280 --> 01:22:34,280
You know how they've always talked about Xbox Gold is going to be going away in favor of some of these other perks?

1467
01:22:34,280 --> 01:22:37,280
Because how can they otherwise compete with Sony?

1468
01:22:37,280 --> 01:22:42,280
Sony makes a pretty damn good argument when they say you don't have to pay for our online gaming.

1469
01:22:42,280 --> 01:22:47,280
Microsoft's going to make online gaming and Halo and shit free before you know it.

1470
01:22:47,280 --> 01:22:49,280
And you know what it is?

1471
01:22:49,280 --> 01:22:51,280
This is what you're going to be paying for.

1472
01:22:51,280 --> 01:22:56,280
These gold games and these extra services and the live hosts and the prizes and all this stuff.

1473
01:22:56,280 --> 01:23:03,280
Xbox has finally conned you into buying something like a membership to Pogo.com or one of those sites.

1474
01:23:03,280 --> 01:23:07,280
You know, where you play the online games for cash and prizes and stuff.

1475
01:23:07,280 --> 01:23:09,280
And that's just the first one that popped in my mind.

1476
01:23:09,280 --> 01:23:11,280
But there's tons of these sites out there.

1477
01:23:11,280 --> 01:23:13,280
That's what the Xbox is going to be.

1478
01:23:13,280 --> 01:23:19,280
And they won't take half the shit that a lot of the people say when they talk about those other sites.

1479
01:23:19,280 --> 01:23:21,280
Watch. Watch.

1480
01:23:21,280 --> 01:23:24,280
That's what's going to happen with Xbox Live Gold.

1481
01:23:24,280 --> 01:23:26,280
I don't know about that.

1482
01:23:26,280 --> 01:23:31,280
That's a prediction, not a fact, but I could definitely see that happening.

1483
01:23:31,280 --> 01:23:38,280
They've got a lot with their streaming and Netflix, the social networking stuff now.

1484
01:23:38,280 --> 01:23:44,280
You have Xbox Live Arcade, the independent games now, the community games.

1485
01:23:44,280 --> 01:23:48,280
Xbox Originals, you can download full games on there now.

1486
01:23:48,280 --> 01:23:51,280
You can play your DVDs, all that stuff.

1487
01:23:51,280 --> 01:23:54,280
So it's basically an entertainment console.

1488
01:23:54,280 --> 01:23:58,280
Now you go to the Wii and you can play games on it.

1489
01:23:58,280 --> 01:24:01,280
You can send a message to your friends.

1490
01:24:01,280 --> 01:24:03,280
That's about it.

1491
01:24:03,280 --> 01:24:05,280
I mean, it's really limited.

1492
01:24:05,280 --> 01:24:11,280
I mean, you can play retro games and stuff like that, but it's really limited as far as the entertainment value.

1493
01:24:11,280 --> 01:24:14,280
I mean, it's really just a gaming console.

1494
01:24:14,280 --> 01:24:17,280
But, I mean, maybe this Wii HD will change all that.

1495
01:24:17,280 --> 01:24:20,280
Maybe they will hopefully fix their online network.

1496
01:24:20,280 --> 01:24:22,280
All right, I've got to read a couple more chats and then we've got to move on.

1497
01:24:22,280 --> 01:24:26,280
Unfortunately, I think we're finding that when we allow ourselves to talk more about stories,

1498
01:24:26,280 --> 01:24:28,280
we talk about them for like 20 minutes at a time.

1499
01:24:28,280 --> 01:24:32,280
We're almost an hour and a half in and we've still got mail bags slated for this segment.

1500
01:24:32,280 --> 01:24:34,280
But I do want to read a couple more comments.

1501
01:24:34,280 --> 01:24:37,280
There's a great talk in chat.orangeonchurch.com tonight.

1502
01:24:37,280 --> 01:24:42,280
sj100matt says, with the economy the way it is, some of us can't keep buying this updated shit.

1503
01:24:42,280 --> 01:24:45,280
Granted, this recession isn't forever, for all we know.

1504
01:24:45,280 --> 01:24:47,280
Yeah, wishful thinking. Let's hope you're right.

1505
01:24:47,280 --> 01:24:51,280
But releasing the next new console isn't going to get the consumer to buy at this time.

1506
01:24:51,280 --> 01:24:56,280
And then sj100matt continues in response to when I said the real war is coming.

1507
01:24:56,280 --> 01:24:58,280
He says, well, fuck their war.

1508
01:24:58,280 --> 01:25:01,280
I'm not going to fund it unless they make it worth my while.

1509
01:25:01,280 --> 01:25:09,280
And that's a very good retort is that these things are only as good as the games that are on it,

1510
01:25:09,280 --> 01:25:11,280
as we've always said.

1511
01:25:11,280 --> 01:25:14,280
But something to think about, though, because you talk about the economy and all of that.

1512
01:25:14,280 --> 01:25:18,280
Keep in mind, entertainment is one of the things that manages to persevere through the economy.

1513
01:25:18,280 --> 01:25:21,280
You know, the movie industry, look at those movies that are out right now.

1514
01:25:21,280 --> 01:25:24,280
Granted, there's been little dips in the movie industry,

1515
01:25:24,280 --> 01:25:27,280
but not the major types of dips you would see in an economy like this,

1516
01:25:27,280 --> 01:25:30,280
especially when ticket prices are still rising.

1517
01:25:30,280 --> 01:25:33,280
Yeah, entertainment's not really hurting as bad.

1518
01:25:33,280 --> 01:25:35,280
Although they claim that they are.

1519
01:25:35,280 --> 01:25:38,280
A lot of people are willing to pay top dollar for entertainment.

1520
01:25:38,280 --> 01:25:42,280
But not to devalue what he's saying, because I think the argument is still a valid one,

1521
01:25:42,280 --> 01:25:47,280
is that, yeah, you still got to convince me that it's worth it to upgrade to a Wii HD.

1522
01:25:47,280 --> 01:25:51,280
But Nintendo, the thing about Nintendo, you know what they've got in their back pocket?

1523
01:25:51,280 --> 01:25:55,280
Mario, Zelda, Metroid, the characters you love.

1524
01:25:55,280 --> 01:25:57,280
That's what they're holding in their back pocket.

1525
01:25:57,280 --> 01:25:59,280
And people that will buy anything that says Nintendo on it.

1526
01:25:59,280 --> 01:26:03,280
And all they have to do is show, hey, look, it's Link in HD.

1527
01:26:03,280 --> 01:26:05,280
Boom! Instant fanboy boner in sales.

1528
01:26:05,280 --> 01:26:09,280
And myself being one of them, I'm in line.

1529
01:26:09,280 --> 01:26:12,280
I think a lot of us will be.

1530
01:26:12,280 --> 01:26:13,280
Yeah.

1531
01:26:13,280 --> 01:26:16,280
Let's face it, Nintendo taught us at age seven.

1532
01:26:16,280 --> 01:26:20,280
You love Mario, and you love Link, and you love these games.

1533
01:26:20,280 --> 01:26:22,280
And they will be with you forever.

1534
01:26:22,280 --> 01:26:26,280
I'm loving Mario a lot less lately, though. I just have to say that.

1535
01:26:26,280 --> 01:26:27,280
I don't know.

1536
01:26:27,280 --> 01:26:30,280
Not buying that new Super Mario Brothers game, sorry.

1537
01:26:30,280 --> 01:26:34,280
I'm not in it now because I don't have the friends to play with on the regular basis.

1538
01:26:34,280 --> 01:26:37,280
I can't buy new Super Mario Brothers because I don't have enough friends.

1539
01:26:37,280 --> 01:26:39,280
That's what it boils down to.

1540
01:26:39,280 --> 01:26:42,280
So, yeah.

1541
01:26:42,280 --> 01:26:44,280
Totally changed topic.

1542
01:26:44,280 --> 01:26:54,280
EA, apparently, they've drawn some attention from, I guess, their prote-

1543
01:26:54,280 --> 01:26:57,280
Not even really a real protest. It's a fake protest.

1544
01:26:57,280 --> 01:27:00,280
At E3, they had protesters out front.

1545
01:27:00,280 --> 01:27:01,280
Did you see it?

1546
01:27:01,280 --> 01:27:03,280
Yeah, I saw it. I saw the protesters.

1547
01:27:03,280 --> 01:27:04,280
Did you think it was real at first?

1548
01:27:04,280 --> 01:27:06,280
Nope, not at all.

1549
01:27:06,280 --> 01:27:10,280
I had a moment of hesitation because I was looking at it, and I was walking by,

1550
01:27:10,280 --> 01:27:13,280
and I was thinking, you know, with the crazies in this state, I almost believe it.

1551
01:27:13,280 --> 01:27:17,280
You know, as I was kind of walking by, I was like, oh, my God.

1552
01:27:17,280 --> 01:27:19,280
This is kind of cool.

1553
01:27:19,280 --> 01:27:21,280
Like, the crazies are out here protesting E3.

1554
01:27:21,280 --> 01:27:22,280
This is awesome.

1555
01:27:22,280 --> 01:27:25,280
But then as I was walking in the hall, and I started to post about it to the OLR Twitter,

1556
01:27:25,280 --> 01:27:29,280
because you might remember at E3, I was letting the folks on Twitter control what I was looking at,

1557
01:27:29,280 --> 01:27:30,280
and I started to tweet about it.

1558
01:27:30,280 --> 01:27:33,280
And as I was doing it, I was thinking, you know what?

1559
01:27:33,280 --> 01:27:36,280
They had, like, the EA logo on one of those boards, and some of these...

1560
01:27:36,280 --> 01:27:39,280
These guys knew way too much about games.

1561
01:27:39,280 --> 01:27:42,280
Oh, my... I just bought it, hook, line, and sinker.

1562
01:27:42,280 --> 01:27:47,280
This protest was something that was staged for some game I haven't even been following.

1563
01:27:47,280 --> 01:27:52,280
Yeah, and in fact, that wasn't the only person who bought that hook, line, and sinker.

1564
01:27:52,280 --> 01:28:02,280
Apparently, the bloggers at LA Times, who basically wrote that the protesters promoted a multimedia anti-game website,

1565
01:28:02,280 --> 01:28:11,280
the EA reps, of course, later confirmed to the Associated Press that the whole affair was staged by a marketing agency.

1566
01:28:11,280 --> 01:28:18,280
It says now, apparently, game politics, they're pointing out that the stunt has angered many real Catholic bloggers.

1567
01:28:18,280 --> 01:28:22,280
Margaret Cabaniss of Inside Catholic wrote,

1568
01:28:22,280 --> 01:28:32,280
It's been clear for a while now that the entertainment industry views Christians on the whole as priggish, thin-skinned funkillers.

1569
01:28:32,280 --> 01:28:37,280
Has anybody at EA actually read The Inferno?

1570
01:28:37,280 --> 01:28:41,280
I'm sorry, but that's kind of funny.

1571
01:28:41,280 --> 01:28:51,280
Another blogger, I guess, at Catholic Video Games wrote that gamers of all varieties will buy this product if it's, well, actually a good game.

1572
01:28:51,280 --> 01:28:57,280
So instead of engaging in a shameless anti-Christian stunt to promote your poor excuse of a product,

1573
01:28:57,280 --> 01:29:06,280
you might ought to work on making this game something better than a blatant God of War ripoff and make it something worthwhile.

1574
01:29:06,280 --> 01:29:11,280
That second guy's actually got a good point, because yeah, it is a blatant God of War ripoff.

1575
01:29:11,280 --> 01:29:16,280
But from the people I talked to that saw the game, it was behind closed doors, we weren't special enough to see it,

1576
01:29:16,280 --> 01:29:19,280
but some of the people I talked to that saw it said, hey, it looks really good.

1577
01:29:19,280 --> 01:29:24,280
Well, yeah, God of War is awesome. I mean, if a game blatantly rips it off, it's going to be fun, so I mean, why not?

1578
01:29:24,280 --> 01:29:31,280
And yeah, I do have to laugh, because I do see Catholics, unfortunately, that way. Being a Catholic myself, I, yeah.

1579
01:29:31,280 --> 01:29:37,280
And now I'm thinking back on the whole thing, and I'm kind of like, oh my gosh, I was so stupid to even believe it for like a minute,

1580
01:29:37,280 --> 01:29:41,280
because one of those people, I swear to God, was dressed in the Puritan outfit.

1581
01:29:41,280 --> 01:29:50,280
Like, the fucking Salem witch trials, like, out there, you know, in the fucking, like, churning the butter outfit. Burn the witch! Burn the witch!

1582
01:29:50,280 --> 01:29:52,280
Well, you should know, we should...

1583
01:29:52,280 --> 01:30:00,280
And I should, I, but, here's, here's what I ask you guys. Should you be mad that they did it, or should you be mad that people believed it?

1584
01:30:00,280 --> 01:30:07,280
That it actually was happening for a minute? Because unfortunately, with some of these other things that sometimes you hear about the way,

1585
01:30:07,280 --> 01:30:15,280
and I'm not talking about, you know, most people are pretty normal, but that, you know, unfortunately, there are 52% of the population in California

1586
01:30:15,280 --> 01:30:21,280
that have bought into this whole thing that it's okay for, you know, religion to take away some of these rights and all this stuff,

1587
01:30:21,280 --> 01:30:29,280
you know, because of all of this and all these other... There's many of us that believed for a minute it was true! Isn't that something to be concerned about?

1588
01:30:29,280 --> 01:30:37,280
No. And, you know, at the same time, I think this whole, you know, stunt, it didn't really do anything other than draw attention to, obviously, the game,

1589
01:30:37,280 --> 01:30:41,280
which is what they're hoping that it would, but it's not like the protest was,

1590
01:30:41,280 --> 01:30:48,280
oh my god, there's so much full-frontal nudity in this game, it's unbelievable! And the violence and sex is just crazy!

1591
01:30:48,280 --> 01:30:53,280
You know, then people would be like, oh, I gotta play this game, you know? Like, I would have been like, tell me more!

1592
01:30:53,280 --> 01:31:04,280
But, no, it's just like, oh, there's the devil in this game. Really? Dante's Inferno, there's the devil in it, and evil, and oh my god, that's so unexpected.

1593
01:31:04,280 --> 01:31:12,280
Well, when I walked by, I thought those people were protesting E3, and I was like, oh my gosh, and I could totally see the people out there.

1594
01:31:12,280 --> 01:31:18,280
I mean, you know, there are these sick, sick people out there that, well, I shouldn't even mention it,

1595
01:31:18,280 --> 01:31:23,280
because, you know, after what I just said, I wouldn't want to compare the two, because there's these obvious loons

1596
01:31:23,280 --> 01:31:30,280
that go out there and protest these weddings, and not weddings, but funerals of people that have served for our country,

1597
01:31:30,280 --> 01:31:35,280
and that they'll protest these funerals, I'm not even going to say who they are, because I don't want to give them attention,

1598
01:31:35,280 --> 01:31:41,280
but they go out and protest these funerals of soldiers who died in the war, saying, this is because we have fags in America,

1599
01:31:41,280 --> 01:31:50,280
that this soldier died and is burning in hell at this very moment. I mean, clearly crazed people out there doing it,

1600
01:31:50,280 --> 01:31:55,280
and so I thought maybe E3 actually got a little bit of that, like, hey, Jack Thompson got his buddies together.

1601
01:31:55,280 --> 01:32:00,280
You know, why did they even bother? They should have just tipped off the right people, you know, about that stuff,

1602
01:32:00,280 --> 01:32:06,280
that they could have had actual, you know, protesters out there, but, do we have anyone that wants to comment on this?

1603
01:32:06,280 --> 01:32:11,280
1-877-GAME-OLR. Did you think it was real? Did you buy into this for a minute? I want to know.

1604
01:32:11,280 --> 01:32:13,280
Or are you Catholic and pissed off?

1605
01:32:13,280 --> 01:32:20,280
Do you not remember when we did a protest, or we were kind of observing of a protest for booth babes back in 2006?

1606
01:32:20,280 --> 01:32:22,280
And that was all just a play for...

1607
01:32:22,280 --> 01:32:25,280
That was all hoax, too, and that got picked up by a lot of bloggers.

1608
01:32:25,280 --> 01:32:28,280
But nobody went to the outpost, because wasn't that Scott's outpost?

1609
01:32:28,280 --> 01:32:29,280
Yes, it was.

1610
01:32:29,280 --> 01:32:30,280
And nobody went.

1611
01:32:30,280 --> 01:32:33,280
Well, that part of the plan failed, but it still got picked up.

1612
01:32:33,280 --> 01:32:37,280
I shouldn't say nobody. He had a decent crowd, but I think they were hoping for a little more, you know what I mean?

1613
01:32:37,280 --> 01:32:44,280
Yes, part B of the plan, not exactly executed correctly, but the part A part did quite well.

1614
01:32:44,280 --> 01:32:49,280
It got picked up on the blogs, because, hey, guess what, they're booth babes, or, you know, babes that are carrying signs,

1615
01:32:49,280 --> 01:32:56,280
and, hey, it's a story and a pretty picture that go along with the story. Awesome.

1616
01:32:56,280 --> 01:33:02,280
But, yeah, I think, I mean, the game itself, the whole protest thing seems unnecessary.

1617
01:33:02,280 --> 01:33:08,280
But they should have had his devil's ring around. That'd be kind of cool. The signs.

1618
01:33:08,280 --> 01:33:17,280
SSTA 100 Matt says, you know, Rob, not to get off topic, but the church's private organizations are running the same hate ads on the radio in New York for anti-gay marriage legislation.

1619
01:33:17,280 --> 01:33:20,280
Let me respond to this in a minute, because we're getting a call.

1620
01:33:20,280 --> 01:33:23,280
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?

1621
01:33:23,280 --> 01:33:24,280
This is Leo Shen.

1622
01:33:24,280 --> 01:33:31,280
Hey, Leo Shen, what's on your mind? This whole Dante's Inferno protesting. Is this offensive? Is it funny? Did you believe it?

1623
01:33:31,280 --> 01:33:40,280
I actually found it hilarious, because I went to Fanime not too long ago, and there was actually protesters protesting Fanime.

1624
01:33:40,280 --> 01:33:51,280
Really? Oh my gosh. Okay, I've been to Fanime. I've not seen the protesters. And it was the real deal? What were they saying? Cosplayers need to put down the cosplay and read the Bible?

1625
01:33:51,280 --> 01:34:03,280
I'm not too sure, because I was looking at them from a distance, but I guess they were protesting against, like, you know, hentai and all that stuff against the anime porn.

1626
01:34:03,280 --> 01:34:12,280
But the really funny thing was they had a cosplayer who came as Jesus to the anime convention, and he just went out there, and it was just hilarious.

1627
01:34:12,280 --> 01:34:18,280
There's always somebody that's got to push the buttons. Did the protesters respond to the man in the Jesus cosplay?

1628
01:34:18,280 --> 01:34:27,280
They just ignored him. And they had this other cosplayer who came out as Jesus, but as a raptor dinosaur.

1629
01:34:27,280 --> 01:34:34,280
Wait, Jesus is a raptor dinosaur? How does that even work? Even I think I'm offended by that one.

1630
01:34:34,280 --> 01:34:39,280
It's called 4chan. The fouls of the internet.

1631
01:34:39,280 --> 01:34:46,280
The home of internet offensiveness. Alright, I understand. Well, thank you, Leo Shen, for the call. And thank you very much. I'm going to let you go.

1632
01:34:46,280 --> 01:34:56,280
But, you know, just thinking about the whole, you know, again, protesters were at Fanime. Why can't they be at E3?

1633
01:34:56,280 --> 01:35:04,280
Anyway, I wanted to respond to this real quick, because, yes, it is a little off topic, but I need to say something, because obviously, you know, being gay myself, I have a whole lot to say on this.

1634
01:35:04,280 --> 01:35:14,280
SJ100Matt says, you know, Rob, not to get off topic, but the same churches, private organizations are running the same hate ads on the radio in New York for anti-gay marriage legislation.

1635
01:35:14,280 --> 01:35:25,280
So, again, this just goes back to the whole, that's why I believed it when you had the chick in the Puritan outfit there with the sign that says, you know, Dante's Inferno, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

1636
01:35:25,280 --> 01:35:36,280
Because when I see these ads and I hear these hate speech and stuff like that on the radio about, you know, withholding people's rights, when it's in the goddamn Constitution on the 14th Amendment,

1637
01:35:36,280 --> 01:35:44,280
no state shall pass a law that robs people of the pursuit to life, liberty, et cetera, et cetera.

1638
01:35:44,280 --> 01:35:54,280
Okay? Like, when I see these ads, that's what I hear in my head. Burn the witch! Burn them! Throw them in the river, see if they float! Don't give them any rights!

1639
01:35:54,280 --> 01:35:58,280
It's the archaic way of thinking. It's always something.

1640
01:35:58,280 --> 01:36:06,280
Sorry if I'm getting a little too personal and political for you, but deal. You know, this is, you know, my rights that are being affected here.

1641
01:36:06,280 --> 01:36:10,280
When have I ever shut up about that topic on the show?

1642
01:36:10,280 --> 01:36:13,280
All right, anything else to say about the protest, Loki?

1643
01:36:13,280 --> 01:36:16,280
Uh, no, it was retarded looking.

1644
01:36:16,280 --> 01:36:23,280
I mean, the whole thing was a little silly, but I will admit, I believed it for like half a second. I really did.

1645
01:36:23,280 --> 01:36:29,280
All right. Usually at the end of Part A, we would do the Classic Game of the Week, but unfortunately, Dark Sakura is not here.

1646
01:36:29,280 --> 01:36:34,280
She will be here. We're anticipating during the next part of the show, so in the meantime, we need to get into the mailbag.

1647
01:36:34,280 --> 01:36:38,280
We're going to switch out mailbag and do it during Part A tonight, so let's open up the mail.

1648
01:36:38,280 --> 01:36:48,280
Mailbag at Orangelaungerator.com if you want to send us an email. That's the place to go, and we're always curious about your thoughts.

1649
01:36:48,280 --> 01:36:55,280
GeneralGurdover sent us an email wanting us to check out their podcast.

1650
01:36:55,280 --> 01:37:00,280
Well, I haven't checked it out yet. Sadly, I'm behind on the email, but nun2k.com.

1651
01:37:00,280 --> 01:37:05,280
I'm always one to support independent podcasters. I hope that wasn't a porn ad or something in disguise.

1652
01:37:05,280 --> 01:37:09,280
Will somebody please check that website out and let me make sure it is a legitimate indie podcast for me?

1653
01:37:09,280 --> 01:37:18,280
I want to read this email. This email comes to us from... I don't want to read the real name there.

1654
01:37:18,280 --> 01:37:24,280
I don't think there is a real name. I will say the email says Nutman, so we'll call this person Nutman.

1655
01:37:24,280 --> 01:37:29,280
Loki, can you please not yell so much?

1656
01:37:29,280 --> 01:37:30,280
No, I can't.

1657
01:37:30,280 --> 01:37:38,280
I had to turn down the volume almost ten times in episode 326 because Loki was yelling so loudly, it was hurting my ears.

1658
01:37:38,280 --> 01:37:40,280
You can't be alone in this, right?

1659
01:37:40,280 --> 01:37:43,280
P.S. O.L.R. is awesome, as is Loki.

1660
01:37:43,280 --> 01:37:45,280
I guess you just need to turn it down a little bit, Loki.

1661
01:37:45,280 --> 01:37:50,280
This could be a problem that we've moved studios. We unhook and hook up the mics every week.

1662
01:37:50,280 --> 01:37:55,280
We do rely on the live listeners to tell us if things sound way too crazy.

1663
01:37:55,280 --> 01:37:58,280
Live listeners, if we are too loud, let us know, please.

1664
01:37:58,280 --> 01:38:04,280
We'd be happy to turn down the volume a little bit so you guys don't have to suffer so much.

1665
01:38:04,280 --> 01:38:10,280
Loki's yelled for seven years. That's his thing on the show, if you haven't figured that out by now.

1666
01:38:10,280 --> 01:38:14,280
That's not yelling. I don't know what you're talking about.

1667
01:38:14,280 --> 01:38:19,280
Well, I'm not talking about yelling like you might yell at somebody you're mad at, but I'm talking about you do have angry white man voice.

1668
01:38:19,280 --> 01:38:26,280
That's just your last name, angry white man voice.

1669
01:38:26,280 --> 01:38:30,280
He has angry white man voice, that's right.

1670
01:38:30,280 --> 01:38:34,280
But, yeah, we'll try to make sure it doesn't get out of control.

1671
01:38:34,280 --> 01:38:39,280
So, chatters, please feel free to speak up if Loki is getting too loud.

1672
01:38:39,280 --> 01:38:42,280
Let's see, we got a lot of emails this week.

1673
01:38:42,280 --> 01:38:46,280
This comes to us from J-Rod.

1674
01:38:46,280 --> 01:38:50,280
Hey, O.L.R. folks, I'm writing in a comment on Left 4 Dead 2 boycott.

1675
01:38:50,280 --> 01:38:56,280
I want to stand on the other side of the fence from all the opinions in the O.L.R. studio just for argument's sake.

1676
01:38:56,280 --> 01:39:00,280
I'm not one of the people who are butthurt about this, but I can understand why people are pissed.

1677
01:39:00,280 --> 01:39:04,280
I agree that the game is coming out way too soon since the first one was just released in November.

1678
01:39:04,280 --> 01:39:13,280
The reason people are pissed isn't because they are spoiled, it's because they expect more from Valve with integrity compared to, say, Activision in regards to putting out sequels for a cash grab.

1679
01:39:13,280 --> 01:39:23,280
The reason people support Valve by buying up their games and having such consumer loyalty is because Valve always takes care of their customers with free updates, content, and product support.

1680
01:39:23,280 --> 01:39:38,280
Personally, I think they could have put all this content into the first game with a huge update, but this sequel reeks of Microsoft holding a leash because they won't allow free stuff on Xbox Live, the same way they forced Epic to charge for map packs in Gears of War 2 that Epic intended to be free.

1681
01:39:38,280 --> 01:39:50,280
To address Loki's statement on huge E3 lines for the game and how everyone is going to buy it, that's fine and dandy, but I don't expect to hear any whining when everyone buys piles upon piles of the newest Guitar Hero and Wii Fit sports games.

1682
01:39:50,280 --> 01:39:53,280
Which is funny because we just whined about that earlier in the show.

1683
01:39:53,280 --> 01:40:03,280
Also, one more shorter point. Everyone at the OLR Studio seems to be taking a crap on Sony for their lack of content for this year. Have you all completely missed Sony's biggest release of the year, Infamous?

1684
01:40:03,280 --> 01:40:10,280
I'm actually surprised to hear nobody on the show talking about it because it's a very big PS3 exclusive release put out by Sucker Punch.

1685
01:40:10,280 --> 01:40:18,280
PS, $250 for a PSP. Apparently cocaine is a hell of a drug. This email is sponsored by the Olive Garden Home of the Never Ending Salad and Breadsticks.

1686
01:40:18,280 --> 01:40:24,280
Yeah, I heard about Infamous. I'm well aware of it being out and unfortunately, though, I'm playing Prototype, which is almost...

1687
01:40:24,280 --> 01:40:28,280
I mean, it's not identical, but I mean, it's the same type of gameplay right now.

1688
01:40:28,280 --> 01:40:36,280
And I think you didn't hear us say anything about it because the game, like, came out. So there wasn't really a lot of, like, hubub about it at E3. It was, you know, more of...

1689
01:40:36,280 --> 01:40:37,280
They had it there.

1690
01:40:37,280 --> 01:40:43,280
I think they had it there, but it was just, you know, people weren't really paying attention to that because they're like, hey, this is out next week. Let's look at, you know, all this other stuff.

1691
01:40:43,280 --> 01:40:49,280
And then it seemed like, I think, part of the point you were trying to make last week is that it seemed like there was this huge gap in the rest of 2009.

1692
01:40:49,280 --> 01:40:56,280
And then we've got all this stuff that's supposed to come out in 2010. Although it does seem like, you know, we'll be peppered with a few nice things here and there.

1693
01:40:56,280 --> 01:41:05,280
Yeah, I mean, Infamous looks good. I'm planning on picking up maybe later on, but like I mentioned earlier, I have, like, two PlayStation 3 games, though, that have come out back in.

1694
01:41:05,280 --> 01:41:14,280
One in November, one in, you know, the end of February that I'm still waiting to play. And I've just... I'm catching up.

1695
01:41:14,280 --> 01:41:18,280
Let's talk, though, about the other end of the more meatier part of the email about Left 4 Dead 2.

1696
01:41:18,280 --> 01:41:24,280
Because we did go off on quite a tangent about this game last week and, you know, talk about, you know, that people should stop whining so much.

1697
01:41:24,280 --> 01:41:35,280
But does he make a point that, you know, Microsoft wanted this other company to charge for their map packs? You know, is this Microsoft's influence? That it's a cash grab?

1698
01:41:35,280 --> 01:41:36,280
No.

1699
01:41:36,280 --> 01:41:41,280
I have to admit, although I respect the points brought up in this email, my opinion has not changed.

1700
01:41:41,280 --> 01:41:42,280
I don't think it's Microsoft's fault.

1701
01:41:42,280 --> 01:41:44,280
And I don't think it can change until the game comes out.

1702
01:41:44,280 --> 01:42:01,280
I think it's EA's fault. Because EA would be the publisher. And at the same time, though, they're saying, oh, well, we've made enhancements to the AI, to the director, and there's stuff that we couldn't have done in Left 4 Dead 1 and stuff.

1703
01:42:01,280 --> 01:42:06,280
And really, in the end, it's the developer deciding to do it or not.

1704
01:42:06,280 --> 01:42:21,280
I mean, because they don't have to. And we're talking download content, you know, they could put out those enhancements, you know, the map packs and stuff like that for Left 4 Dead or, you know, other stuff, maybe Team Fortress 2 and stuff, maybe add, you know, sell it.

1705
01:42:21,280 --> 01:42:32,280
They could put that stuff out. But, you know, if it's, you know, the fact that it's being, you know, that they won't let them put it out for free, well, that's still an excuse because they can always put it out for as cheap as possible, you know.

1706
01:42:32,280 --> 01:42:44,280
Here's my biggest thing. This is why I don't get it yet, and why I'm not on board with you guys yet, because the game isn't out. And there's still a long way to go before the holiday, and we don't really know the full potential of this game just yet.

1707
01:42:44,280 --> 01:42:54,280
Granted, we got a lot of details out of E3 and so forth. Here's why I don't like these Guitar Hero games upon game. They feel like cheap re-skinning of the previous game.

1708
01:42:54,280 --> 01:43:05,280
But you'll notice we haven't said any of that about Beatles Rock Band. We've lavished praise upon praise upon where this game's going, because it does feel like a completely unique, justifiably separately purchased game.

1709
01:43:05,280 --> 01:43:13,280
And if Left 4 Dead 2 ultimately is that at the end, I don't think you guys, you know, whether this could have been an update or not, have much to stand on.

1710
01:43:13,280 --> 01:43:24,280
However, if the game is a cheap re-skinning of Left 4 Dead 1 with just four new characters and new maps and all the same enemies as before and all that, then I am right there with you. I will sign the goddamn petition myself.

1711
01:43:24,280 --> 01:43:35,280
But I don't think we can really say until the game is out. And Valve, as a developer, does not seem like the type of company that would do that, but I don't know. It could be wishful thinking.

1712
01:43:35,280 --> 01:43:45,280
At the same time, like I mentioned before, don't you guys think you might be a little bit spoiled by them? I mean, I think their support of the community and everything has been huge.

1713
01:43:45,280 --> 01:43:55,280
I mean, look at what they're doing with Team Fortress 2. It's just like updates upon updates for this game that came out, you know, a while ago and still, you know, huge support for it.

1714
01:43:55,280 --> 01:44:08,280
And I think at the same time, you don't realize that, you know, yeah, they're putting a lot of support behind this, but at the same time, they need to make some money too. And yeah, that's not an excuse, I guess, in the gamer's eyes to put out another game.

1715
01:44:08,280 --> 01:44:16,280
But at the same time, maybe there's something that really they can't do where they felt, okay, this is different enough that it justifies its own release.

1716
01:44:16,280 --> 01:44:29,280
I don't know. I mean, you can't just have everything be exactly the same all the time. Things have to change, so I guess, you know, if you don't like it, don't buy it.

1717
01:44:29,280 --> 01:44:38,280
And then, you know what, if the sales suck on it, then they'll learn, okay, maybe we can't do this. If that's really, you know, a money grab.

1718
01:44:38,280 --> 01:44:48,280
Yeah, we have some comments on chat and, you know, again, it seems to be that most people are saying, Act F says, bah, cry more. That's my opinion on the Left 4 Dead 2 boycott.

1719
01:44:48,280 --> 01:44:54,280
GameGuru says, I'm willing to give Left 4 Dead 2 the benefit of the doubt because it means Left 4 Dead 1 will be cheaper.

1720
01:44:54,280 --> 01:45:07,280
There you go. I don't know, I guess we'll see a little more when this game actually is released. I think that's when I have to reserve my ultimate judgment for is when the game's released.

1721
01:45:07,280 --> 01:45:17,280
If it stinks then, then I'll be right there in line with you guys and if they try to push out Left 4 Dead 3 in 2010, if Left 4 Dead 2 stinks, I will openly mock it here on this program.

1722
01:45:17,280 --> 01:45:24,280
I mean, and just, you know, I wouldn't exactly blame Microsoft for, I mean, look at the company that's, you know, helping to publish these games.

1723
01:45:24,280 --> 01:45:32,280
They're known for putting out numerous sports games each year numerically. I mean, come on.

1724
01:45:32,280 --> 01:45:42,280
I want to read this email real quick and this comes to us from our old buddy Rini. I'm not going to read the whole thing because it's very, very lengthy, but I do want to read bits and pieces of it and give this game a little shout out here.

1725
01:45:42,280 --> 01:45:49,280
Greetings, OLR peoples. Rini here and I just got into the free limited beta for Ion online that happened for the weekend of June 7th.

1726
01:45:49,280 --> 01:45:56,280
I'm trying the game out because Warcraft has become the doldrums and also because it's become my best friend's next fangasm until Final Fantasy XIV.

1727
01:45:56,280 --> 01:46:01,280
For the bulk of this lengthy email, I'm going to describe some features from the game that I've witnessed in comparison to WoW.

1728
01:46:01,280 --> 01:46:08,280
It talks about the plot being two rival races. It talks about that it's got the character customization of Elder Scrolls Oblivion.

1729
01:46:08,280 --> 01:46:14,280
There's a mage, priest, scouts, and warriors. At level 9, a quest is automatically given to you to get your wings.

1730
01:46:14,280 --> 01:46:18,280
It's basically a free ride to level 10 that you should get to all the different capital cities.

1731
01:46:18,280 --> 01:46:26,280
The flight time is initially limited, but you can extend it. There's loading time when you start the game, but once you get in there, it's very short, around 10 seconds or so.

1732
01:46:26,280 --> 01:46:31,280
The game is very pretty in a Final Fantasy sort of way. The battles are brisk and so forth.

1733
01:46:31,280 --> 01:46:37,280
I'm trying to read through all this. It talks about missions and holding things in a cube and what have you.

1734
01:46:37,280 --> 01:46:44,280
Something WoW neglects. If you're in a high traffic area and it's really bogging your system down, it's no problem.

1735
01:46:44,280 --> 01:46:49,280
Press a keyboard combination and all other player models will disappear.

1736
01:46:49,280 --> 01:46:56,280
I didn't get to try out stuff like parties, alliances, emotes, etc. There's a lot of interface elements that would need a plugin for WoW to show up.

1737
01:46:56,280 --> 01:47:02,280
For example, a quest tracker or a level gauge for quests. For some reason, there's a quest to steal a bathing nymph's clothes too.

1738
01:47:02,280 --> 01:47:07,280
I've taken screenshots of what I've seen around the game, with the game running almost everything at max settings.

1739
01:47:07,280 --> 01:47:13,280
No anti-aliasing, decree, shadow, and water effects. Please skim through it and post to chat if you would like.

1740
01:47:13,280 --> 01:47:19,280
Hopefully Ion will not disappoint. I'm buying the limited edition and getting suckered into playing it anyway because I want to play with my best friend.

1741
01:47:19,280 --> 01:47:24,280
My expectations are low because WoW's PVP just left me insulted with how slow and unfair it was.

1742
01:47:24,280 --> 01:47:28,280
Maybe Ion will be a little closer to something resembling PSO.

1743
01:47:28,280 --> 01:47:34,280
Lastly, I'd like to apologize, especially to Sky, for bringing up hopes for Omega Man Legends 3 for E3. Sorry!

1744
01:47:34,280 --> 01:47:39,280
This email is brought to you by Benafiber. Everyone needs their damn fiber. Fuck yeah, bowel movements.

1745
01:47:39,280 --> 01:47:46,280
I have a question, and this is kind of E3 related, but the whole Mega Man Legends thing.

1746
01:47:46,280 --> 01:47:50,280
I remember Capcom said they had two secret games that they hadn't announced yet.

1747
01:47:50,280 --> 01:47:56,280
One of those got leaked, and that was Tatsunoko vs Capcom All-Stars or whatever it was.

1748
01:47:56,280 --> 01:47:57,280
What the hell was the second one?

1749
01:47:57,280 --> 01:48:00,280
Well, hold on, because we've got a call, and I bet this caller might know.

1750
01:48:00,280 --> 01:48:02,280
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this?

1751
01:48:02,280 --> 01:48:03,280
Hey, what's up guys? It's the Rob D.

1752
01:48:03,280 --> 01:48:07,280
Rob, we had you on hold while Loki was saying that. Do you know what that second game is?

1753
01:48:07,280 --> 01:48:11,280
I think it was a Resident Evil title for the PSP. I think that's what it was.

1754
01:48:11,280 --> 01:48:16,280
I remember hearing that being announced, and I asked a couple people about it, and I think that's what it was.

1755
01:48:16,280 --> 01:48:21,280
That makes sense. Well, Rob, we have the Skyplines open all night tonight, so I know you're calling in to respond to something in the mailbag.

1756
01:48:21,280 --> 01:48:26,280
In fact, you said on chat something about this whole Left 4 Dead 2 boycott. What are your thoughts on it?

1757
01:48:26,280 --> 01:48:29,280
Well, here's the thing. I've seen a lot of different complaints.

1758
01:48:29,280 --> 01:48:35,280
Obviously, people love to complain about everything on forums and on podcasts and everything when it relates to the video game industry,

1759
01:48:35,280 --> 01:48:37,280
because people are passionate about it. It's their interest.

1760
01:48:37,280 --> 01:48:44,280
And I've seen people defend a lot of stupid things. I've seen people defend us getting nickeled and dimed for horse armor.

1761
01:48:44,280 --> 01:48:49,280
And you know what? That even brings up a lot of strong opinions even today.

1762
01:48:49,280 --> 01:48:55,280
But this is the first time that I've ever seen people do something, gamers in particular, that I just cannot defend at all.

1763
01:48:55,280 --> 01:49:02,280
Because, I mean, really, remember when we got expansion packs back in the late 90s and people got pissed off at that

1764
01:49:02,280 --> 01:49:09,280
because it was just a couple new enemies, more levels, and they weren't even really that good for games like Sin and whatever else.

1765
01:49:09,280 --> 01:49:13,280
We flipped upside down. Now we don't want sequels.

1766
01:49:13,280 --> 01:49:19,280
We don't want these companies to actually give us new engines and give us new sets of things to do.

1767
01:49:19,280 --> 01:49:22,280
We want expansion packs. What has changed now?

1768
01:49:22,280 --> 01:49:27,280
I would give one of my good kidneys to get a sequel, certainly before this year, for Street Fighter,

1769
01:49:27,280 --> 01:49:31,280
and now for a true sequel to Chrono Trigger or Marvel vs. Capcom 3.

1770
01:49:31,280 --> 01:49:37,280
Why are people upset that they're getting a sequel to a game they love? I don't get this.

1771
01:49:37,280 --> 01:49:42,280
Well, I think they feel that this sequel is an expansion pack. That's what it is.

1772
01:49:42,280 --> 01:49:45,280
No, they want it as an expansion pack with DLC. They don't want an actual sequel.

1773
01:49:45,280 --> 01:49:48,280
They don't want Valve to actually put the effort in.

1774
01:49:48,280 --> 01:49:57,280
I understand they want more support for Left 4 Dead, but why don't they want an actual game with new features and hopefully a better game?

1775
01:49:57,280 --> 01:49:59,280
Progress is good.

1776
01:49:59,280 --> 01:50:04,280
Well, I think the argument, and again, I don't really know the other side as well.

1777
01:50:04,280 --> 01:50:10,280
Maybe we'll get emails on it next week, but I think the argument is they feel like, because this is being put together so quickly,

1778
01:50:10,280 --> 01:50:16,280
because the early screenshots and gameplay indicate it's basically Left 4 Dead 1 with new characters enduring the day and a new setting,

1779
01:50:16,280 --> 01:50:23,280
that this is basically a guitar hero Van Halen of Left 4 Dead.

1780
01:50:23,280 --> 01:50:27,280
But we're making our judgments on a handful of trailers and a few screenshots.

1781
01:50:27,280 --> 01:50:31,280
And you hinted at this earlier, that this is Valve. This is not a company.

1782
01:50:31,280 --> 01:50:36,280
Admittedly, I think it is published by EA, right? Or maybe you're talking about Rockband.

1783
01:50:36,280 --> 01:50:39,280
No, this is published by EA.

1784
01:50:39,280 --> 01:50:45,280
Yeah. I understand that since it is published by EA, that is some cause for concern.

1785
01:50:45,280 --> 01:50:50,280
But you know what? This isn't a company that has done this in the past that is developing this game.

1786
01:50:50,280 --> 01:50:53,280
We should give them a little bit of trust.

1787
01:50:53,280 --> 01:50:58,280
Deep Man and Chat says they think it will break up the community, it will split them between the two games.

1788
01:50:58,280 --> 01:51:01,280
I don't know if I necessarily see that so much.

1789
01:51:01,280 --> 01:51:05,280
About Call of Duty, we'll look at Call of Duty World at War and Call of Duty Modern Warfare.

1790
01:51:05,280 --> 01:51:08,280
The games that that happens to are the sports games.

1791
01:51:08,280 --> 01:51:14,280
That's the one where you go into EA 2010, you know, whatever, and then 2009 is abandoned.

1792
01:51:14,280 --> 01:51:20,280
But most games you still find, you know, pretty, like case in point, EverQuest 1 and EverQuest 2.

1793
01:51:20,280 --> 01:51:25,280
Granted, completely different type of game because people invest a lot more time into those types of games.

1794
01:51:25,280 --> 01:51:29,280
But EverQuest 1 still has probably more of a community than EverQuest 2.

1795
01:51:31,280 --> 01:51:34,280
Any other thoughts, Rob? Before we let you go and wrap up part A here.

1796
01:51:34,280 --> 01:51:40,280
Not really. This whole issue just ticks me off so much because, again, there are so many games that I can think of.

1797
01:51:40,280 --> 01:51:44,280
I don't want to bash it, but there are so many games that I enjoy more that I would want sequels to.

1798
01:51:44,280 --> 01:51:48,280
And these people are complaining because they are getting a sequel to it and good timing too.

1799
01:51:48,280 --> 01:51:50,280
Well, let's just hope that the sequel is not cheap.

1800
01:51:50,280 --> 01:51:55,280
Let's hope that what you and I are thinking is the case and that this game will be pretty awesome with a lot of new features.

1801
01:51:55,280 --> 01:51:58,280
Or else, I don't know, they may have a point.

1802
01:51:58,280 --> 01:52:01,280
I think they'll eat crow. But anyway, see you guys later.

1803
01:52:01,280 --> 01:52:02,280
Alright, take care, Rob.

1804
01:52:02,280 --> 01:52:07,280
Yeah, I don't know. I think, I don't know. I don't know. I can't tell until I play the game.

1805
01:52:07,280 --> 01:52:08,280
That's really where it's at.

1806
01:52:08,280 --> 01:52:10,280
Alright, dang, we are really long.

1807
01:52:10,280 --> 01:52:12,280
And sorry I didn't get to all the emails tonight.

1808
01:52:12,280 --> 01:52:15,280
I didn't get the emails from some folks that actually called us anyway or some folks put,

1809
01:52:15,280 --> 01:52:18,280
you don't have to read this on air, so I didn't because we had a lot of emails tonight.

1810
01:52:18,280 --> 01:52:21,280
But if you want to send us an email for a future week, please do.

1811
01:52:21,280 --> 01:52:23,280
Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

1812
01:52:23,280 --> 01:52:25,280
We are going to finally take a break here.

1813
01:52:25,280 --> 01:52:28,280
You know we've been on air for an hour and fifty minutes so far.

1814
01:52:28,280 --> 01:52:29,280
We're going to take a break.

1815
01:52:29,280 --> 01:52:32,280
Dark Soccer is on her way home, so it sounds like she'll be joining us for Part B tonight.

1816
01:52:32,280 --> 01:52:37,280
We'll be right back in about five to ten minutes with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

1817
01:52:37,280 --> 01:52:40,280
For those of you guys listening on the podcast, though, you only have to wait like five seconds.

1818
01:52:40,280 --> 01:52:41,280
Aren't you lucky?

1819
01:52:41,280 --> 01:52:49,280
We'll be right back with plenty more stories here on Orange Lounge Radio.

1820
01:52:49,280 --> 01:52:54,280
Welcome back, everybody, to Part B of tonight's episode, number 327,

1821
01:52:54,280 --> 01:52:58,280
taping live on AllGames.com on this lovely Sunday night.

1822
01:52:58,280 --> 01:53:04,280
We are here, Orange Lounge Radio, myself, Loki, and making her way back into the studio.

1823
01:53:04,280 --> 01:53:07,280
Dark Soccer is here joining us for Part B tonight.

1824
01:53:07,280 --> 01:53:11,280
Hi, I'm just, I will be officially joining probably in about another ten, fifteen minutes.

1825
01:53:11,280 --> 01:53:13,280
You had a PE class or something tonight, right?

1826
01:53:13,280 --> 01:53:19,280
Yeah, I did. I'm taking, well, it's walking slash jogging slash running slash cardio slash whatever

1827
01:53:19,280 --> 01:53:21,280
we want to do as long as it gets the heart rate up for twenty minutes.

1828
01:53:21,280 --> 01:53:22,280
That's the class.

1829
01:53:22,280 --> 01:53:25,280
And it's mostly online, so it's on our system, you know, pretty much.

1830
01:53:25,280 --> 01:53:33,280
But the test our teacher has us do now and the fact that she watches us walk our mile,

1831
01:53:33,280 --> 01:53:38,280
I don't think, unless someone really can fake it well, I don't think anyone's going to be able to, so.

1832
01:53:38,280 --> 01:53:39,280
Interesting.

1833
01:53:39,280 --> 01:53:43,280
Yeah, and apparently this is her third one and she's had a lot of success with it, so I'm pretty happy.

1834
01:53:43,280 --> 01:53:46,280
All right, well, that's all right. Loki and I are going to continue to juggle the stories,

1835
01:53:46,280 --> 01:53:50,280
but please chime in as I know I told you before the show about something new,

1836
01:53:50,280 --> 01:53:52,280
the new experiment we were trying tonight.

1837
01:53:52,280 --> 01:53:56,280
We almost went two hours with Part A, six stories, but lots of opinions out there.

1838
01:53:56,280 --> 01:54:01,280
Well, you know, I actually, I kind of, I was thinking about it actually when I was doing my very painful

1839
01:54:01,280 --> 01:54:03,280
because of my shoes walk.

1840
01:54:03,280 --> 01:54:07,280
No, I got new walking shoes and I need insoles for them because it makes my arch hurt.

1841
01:54:07,280 --> 01:54:13,280
But anyway, enough fitness talk, which I actually want to get back into playing DDR

1842
01:54:13,280 --> 01:54:17,280
because I walked a thirteen minute mile when I was playing DDR once a week.

1843
01:54:17,280 --> 01:54:18,280
I'm on DDR.

1844
01:54:18,280 --> 01:54:22,280
I went to Roseville Golf Land this week, the place where video games go to die.

1845
01:54:22,280 --> 01:54:25,280
I played that lovely, lovely BeatMania 2DX distorted machine they had.

1846
01:54:25,280 --> 01:54:27,280
Player one black keys are sticking already.

1847
01:54:27,280 --> 01:54:28,280
Gotta love it.

1848
01:54:28,280 --> 01:54:30,280
Right side pride.

1849
01:54:30,280 --> 01:54:31,280
Whatever.

1850
01:54:31,280 --> 01:54:33,280
Haha, I don't have to deal with that.

1851
01:54:33,280 --> 01:54:34,280
Die in a right side fire.

1852
01:54:34,280 --> 01:54:35,280
Burn.

1853
01:54:35,280 --> 01:54:40,280
Well, now that I'm not upstairs anymore in my apartment, my DDR hard pads,

1854
01:54:40,280 --> 01:54:44,280
as soon as I figure out how to ground them from the static electricity buildup.

1855
01:54:44,280 --> 01:54:49,280
Let's not revive the DDR discussion from last week because I'll just get really sad.

1856
01:54:49,280 --> 01:54:51,280
The whole thing.

1857
01:54:51,280 --> 01:54:53,280
My pads actually started falling apart.

1858
01:54:53,280 --> 01:54:55,280
Now you're going to have to mod them for eight arrows.

1859
01:54:55,280 --> 01:54:56,280
Remember, that's what we're getting in the PlayStation.

1860
01:54:56,280 --> 01:54:58,280
No, I'm sorry, that's not real DDR.

1861
01:54:58,280 --> 01:55:00,280
Don't buy this Konami bullshit.

1862
01:55:00,280 --> 01:55:01,280
No, we can't think of anything.

1863
01:55:01,280 --> 01:55:02,280
Let's add more arrows.

1864
01:55:02,280 --> 01:55:03,280
I'm more curious.

1865
01:55:03,280 --> 01:55:04,280
Wait, hold on about DDR.

1866
01:55:04,280 --> 01:55:06,280
I'm more curious what Jamie was thinking on her walk

1867
01:55:06,280 --> 01:55:08,280
because it was about the show and the whole thing.

1868
01:55:08,280 --> 01:55:11,280
Well, no, I was just thinking about what it was going to be like,

1869
01:55:11,280 --> 01:55:16,280
and it actually was going to be more like when Larry King has people call in,

1870
01:55:16,280 --> 01:55:18,280
except we're cooler and he's old.

1871
01:55:18,280 --> 01:55:22,280
Well, you know, and I think a lot of the feedback I've kind of heard

1872
01:55:22,280 --> 01:55:24,280
over the couple years we've been doing this, you know,

1873
01:55:24,280 --> 01:55:26,280
because it seems like every year or two years we try something new with the format.

1874
01:55:26,280 --> 01:55:30,280
So we've been doing, what, this whole combined A and B for about, what, a year and a half or so?

1875
01:55:30,280 --> 01:55:34,280
I think one of the feedback I get is, you know, we already kind of hear about the news.

1876
01:55:34,280 --> 01:55:37,280
I tune in to hear you guys, you know, talk about it, make jokes and so forth,

1877
01:55:37,280 --> 01:55:42,280
and the fact that, you know, not a lot of shows are as interactive as you guys.

1878
01:55:42,280 --> 01:55:45,280
I mean, granted, there's lots of shows that are trying to get interactive, you know,

1879
01:55:45,280 --> 01:55:47,280
but they're kind of few and far between.

1880
01:55:47,280 --> 01:55:49,280
We started off that way, really.

1881
01:55:49,280 --> 01:55:51,280
Yeah, I mean, well, that's always what our show's been about.

1882
01:55:51,280 --> 01:55:53,280
We either had the studio full of people or...

1883
01:55:53,280 --> 01:55:57,280
But instead of just running through the news and then let everybody call in on this,

1884
01:55:57,280 --> 01:56:00,280
you know, hodgepock clusterfuck of calls at the end, why not, you know,

1885
01:56:00,280 --> 01:56:02,280
since this is the show where every gamer has a voice,

1886
01:56:02,280 --> 01:56:05,280
spend a little more time on each story and let everybody voice their opinions.

1887
01:56:05,280 --> 01:56:08,280
Giving that same, that, you know, aforementioned voice.

1888
01:56:08,280 --> 01:56:11,280
Yes, and tell the dick and fart joke that goes along with that story.

1889
01:56:11,280 --> 01:56:12,280
Hey, Rob.

1890
01:56:12,280 --> 01:56:13,280
What?

1891
01:56:13,280 --> 01:56:14,280
A dick went fart.

1892
01:56:14,280 --> 01:56:15,280
Ha ha.

1893
01:56:15,280 --> 01:56:17,280
I'm laughing.

1894
01:56:17,280 --> 01:56:18,280
Okay.

1895
01:56:18,280 --> 01:56:22,280
I am going to go freshen up.

1896
01:56:22,280 --> 01:56:23,280
All right.

1897
01:56:23,280 --> 01:56:24,280
Let's see.

1898
01:56:24,280 --> 01:56:25,280
Let's move.

1899
01:56:25,280 --> 01:56:26,280
All right.

1900
01:56:26,280 --> 01:56:28,280
Let's get back into some of that gaming news that we're going to spend a little more time on tonight.

1901
01:56:28,280 --> 01:56:31,280
Of course, you can call us at any time, 1-877-GAME-OLR.

1902
01:56:31,280 --> 01:56:33,280
If we don't get to the story you wanted to talk about tonight, though,

1903
01:56:33,280 --> 01:56:36,280
we will open up the Skype line at the end of the show for open bar.

1904
01:56:36,280 --> 01:56:41,280
Loki, you're going to start us off this half with another story.

1905
01:56:41,280 --> 01:56:42,280
Yes, I am.

1906
01:56:42,280 --> 01:56:50,280
So apparently the PS3 motion controller that they showed off at, you know, E3.

1907
01:56:50,280 --> 01:56:52,280
You know what, that always happens.

1908
01:56:52,280 --> 01:56:53,280
Play happy music.

1909
01:56:53,280 --> 01:56:54,280
Damn it.

1910
01:56:54,280 --> 01:56:55,280
Sorry.

1911
01:56:55,280 --> 01:56:58,280
Maybe someday I'll learn how to fix my audio cues.

1912
01:56:58,280 --> 01:56:59,280
Sorry.

1913
01:56:59,280 --> 01:57:00,280
Yes, PlayStation 3.

1914
01:57:00,280 --> 01:57:01,280
Yes.

1915
01:57:01,280 --> 01:57:06,280
So the new motion controller that they showed off during their E3 press conference,

1916
01:57:06,280 --> 01:57:11,280
it's apparently going to be compatible with existing games,

1917
01:57:11,280 --> 01:57:17,280
which it makes sense because you can patch games and why not?

1918
01:57:17,280 --> 01:57:25,280
I'm not sure if it's exactly going to work the way, say, you think, I don't know,

1919
01:57:25,280 --> 01:57:27,280
a controller, like it wouldn't be mapped.

1920
01:57:27,280 --> 01:57:33,280
Like if, you know, I move my arm down, it's not going to move the analog stick left down or something like that.

1921
01:57:33,280 --> 01:57:35,280
You know, I don't think it's going to be like that.

1922
01:57:35,280 --> 01:57:38,280
But they may be able to patch it in to other games,

1923
01:57:38,280 --> 01:57:41,280
which makes sense because they patched in DualShock 3 support.

1924
01:57:41,280 --> 01:57:42,280
Why not?

1925
01:57:42,280 --> 01:57:44,280
And you know what, I support that.

1926
01:57:44,280 --> 01:57:46,280
I mean, that would be kind of cool.

1927
01:57:46,280 --> 01:57:52,280
You know, some of your older games get new life later on with this controller if you happen to buy it.

1928
01:57:52,280 --> 01:57:55,280
But here's my thing and the reason why I want to talk about this a little bit.

1929
01:57:55,280 --> 01:57:59,280
Do we really need motion control to be shoved down our throat in every game?

1930
01:57:59,280 --> 01:58:02,280
It doesn't have to be, but it's an option.

1931
01:58:02,280 --> 01:58:08,280
It's a good way, say, you put up the motion controller and there's like, say, five games that support it.

1932
01:58:08,280 --> 01:58:12,280
Now you can have like a bunch of games that support it, but it's still going to feel tacked on.

1933
01:58:12,280 --> 01:58:15,280
Maybe this is what I need to make me feel better about this.

1934
01:58:15,280 --> 01:58:18,280
Maybe callers want to input on this 1877 game OLR.

1935
01:58:18,280 --> 01:58:24,280
What game would be better if they went back and added motion control?

1936
01:58:24,280 --> 01:58:31,280
Lair, what Sony PlayStation 3 game is going to be better if they go back and add this whole, you know, Sony,

1937
01:58:31,280 --> 01:58:34,280
it doesn't have an official name, does it yet?

1938
01:58:34,280 --> 01:58:36,280
I think somebody said the PS3 mode.

1939
01:58:36,280 --> 01:58:37,280
Cosmic Ice Cream Cones.

1940
01:58:37,280 --> 01:58:40,280
Okay, the Cosmic Ice Cream Cones.

1941
01:58:40,280 --> 01:58:44,280
What old PlayStation 3 game is going to be better with the Cosmic Ice Cream Cones?

1942
01:58:44,280 --> 01:58:45,280
I don't know.

1943
01:58:45,280 --> 01:58:50,280
Seeing as most PlayStation 3 games are on the Xbox 360, we don't have that yet.

1944
01:58:50,280 --> 01:58:56,280
Here's my thought, maybe they come up with a control scheme for like a first person shooter,

1945
01:58:56,280 --> 01:58:59,280
and then boom, they can put those in the first person shooter games.

1946
01:58:59,280 --> 01:59:01,280
You know, something that works well.

1947
01:59:01,280 --> 01:59:03,280
But yeah, you're right, I don't know.

1948
01:59:03,280 --> 01:59:09,280
Don't you think this is only going to show up though in the actual Sony, you know,

1949
01:59:09,280 --> 01:59:12,280
first party in their own developer type of games?

1950
01:59:12,280 --> 01:59:14,280
Probably, yeah.

1951
01:59:14,280 --> 01:59:16,280
But I mean, I don't know.

1952
01:59:16,280 --> 01:59:25,280
This is all coming from, you know, I want to say it was Jack Trenton who, he says,

1953
01:59:25,280 --> 01:59:29,280
personally it's very difficult for me to perceive God of War 3 played with a Wii controller,

1954
01:59:29,280 --> 01:59:33,280
but it's a different experience that doesn't lend itself to certain types of games,

1955
01:59:33,280 --> 01:59:39,280
but I think our controller can be used with every game that's on the system now

1956
01:59:39,280 --> 01:59:41,280
and every game that we're working on.

1957
01:59:41,280 --> 01:59:44,280
So he could just be blowing smoke up someone's ass, you know.

1958
01:59:44,280 --> 01:59:47,280
My controller's awesome, it works with everything, it's super awesome,

1959
01:59:47,280 --> 01:59:49,280
everything that we touch turns to gold.

1960
01:59:49,280 --> 01:59:53,280
You know, that's basically his thought on it.

1961
01:59:53,280 --> 01:59:56,280
So really we could be reading way too much into this.

1962
01:59:56,280 --> 01:59:59,280
I think the games you're going to see that get this enhancement,

1963
01:59:59,280 --> 02:00:05,280
like Infamous, Killzone 3, all the first person shooters basically,

1964
02:00:05,280 --> 02:00:09,280
Uncharted and Resistance.

1965
02:00:09,280 --> 02:00:13,280
Those will be the games that will support this whole Cosmic Ice Cream codes.

1966
02:00:13,280 --> 02:00:16,280
Honestly, I don't think it's any of these games at all.

1967
02:00:16,280 --> 02:00:21,280
I think since this isn't going to come out for a while, it'll probably be...

1968
02:00:21,280 --> 02:00:24,280
I would be fine if they didn't even patch it backwards,

1969
02:00:24,280 --> 02:00:26,280
because it's just going to be tacking it on.

1970
02:00:26,280 --> 02:00:30,280
It's just, I don't know.

1971
02:00:30,280 --> 02:00:35,280
I mean, it's one-one control, so unless you have it really programmed in the game

1972
02:00:35,280 --> 02:00:38,280
to be really intricate, I don't think it's going to work,

1973
02:00:38,280 --> 02:00:40,280
because you're just going to be making a gesture,

1974
02:00:40,280 --> 02:00:43,280
and it's going to do an action, just like the Wii.

1975
02:00:43,280 --> 02:00:46,280
And I think a lot of it is resources for me.

1976
02:00:46,280 --> 02:00:47,280
That's why I kind of bring this up.

1977
02:00:47,280 --> 02:00:49,280
You know, I know there's a lot of people out there that would say,

1978
02:00:49,280 --> 02:00:50,280
well, what's the harm?

1979
02:00:50,280 --> 02:00:53,280
So they want to go back and add motion control in these games.

1980
02:00:53,280 --> 02:00:54,280
Is that such a bad thing?

1981
02:00:54,280 --> 02:00:56,280
It's added value, it's something extra.

1982
02:00:56,280 --> 02:01:01,280
But I'm saying, well, resources that could be used to instead make new games better.

1983
02:01:01,280 --> 02:01:04,280
Why go back and patch the game with motion controls

1984
02:01:04,280 --> 02:01:07,280
when you can make the sequel have motion controls?

1985
02:01:07,280 --> 02:01:10,280
Then again, I'm also clamoring for some of my old Xbox games

1986
02:01:10,280 --> 02:01:13,280
to still be playable with backwards emulation on Xbox 360,

1987
02:01:13,280 --> 02:01:15,280
which will never happen at this point.

1988
02:01:15,280 --> 02:01:16,280
They're done with that. You know they are.

1989
02:01:16,280 --> 02:01:18,280
They are done.

1990
02:01:18,280 --> 02:01:20,280
Because they want to do the downloads, the digital downloads.

1991
02:01:20,280 --> 02:01:22,280
They're done with classic Xbox at this point.

1992
02:01:22,280 --> 02:01:23,280
The classic Xbox.

1993
02:01:23,280 --> 02:01:25,280
The Xbox 360 digital downloads is where it's at now.

1994
02:01:25,280 --> 02:01:26,280
There's still going to be Xbox originals,

1995
02:01:26,280 --> 02:01:29,280
but it's not going to be anything that wasn't already supported

1996
02:01:29,280 --> 02:01:30,280
with the backwards compatibility.

1997
02:01:30,280 --> 02:01:34,280
There's not going to be any more updates for backwards compatibility,

1998
02:01:34,280 --> 02:01:37,280
unless there really is a team still working on it,

1999
02:01:37,280 --> 02:01:38,280
which I don't think there is.

2000
02:01:38,280 --> 02:01:40,280
I don't think there is either.

2001
02:01:40,280 --> 02:01:43,280
Let's move on and talk about something else with Sony.

2002
02:01:43,280 --> 02:01:48,280
It has to do kind of from the same sort of original source

2003
02:01:48,280 --> 02:01:51,280
that the whole PlayStation 3 motion control can do with.

2004
02:01:51,280 --> 02:01:59,280
I want to talk about the actual president of PlayStation, Jack Trenton, and leaks.

2005
02:01:59,280 --> 02:02:01,280
And a big quote he said.

2006
02:02:01,280 --> 02:02:04,280
It was interesting because at the show,

2007
02:02:04,280 --> 02:02:05,280
when he's actually giving the press conference,

2008
02:02:05,280 --> 02:02:08,280
he joked and was very tongue-in-cheek about the leaks.

2009
02:02:08,280 --> 02:02:11,280
Thank you all for coming out considering everything leaked out.

2010
02:02:11,280 --> 02:02:15,280
He showed his anger a little more this week in an interview

2011
02:02:15,280 --> 02:02:18,280
on a story that was on CSNBC.com this week.

2012
02:02:18,280 --> 02:02:21,280
People don't respect confidentiality in this industry,

2013
02:02:21,280 --> 02:02:23,280
Jack Trenton was quoted as saying.

2014
02:02:23,280 --> 02:02:26,280
It's tough enough to keep a secret within your own company,

2015
02:02:26,280 --> 02:02:30,280
much less when you speak to third parties.

2016
02:02:30,280 --> 02:02:32,280
And they're talking about that right for right now.

2017
02:02:32,280 --> 02:02:35,280
The CNBC article continues on.

2018
02:02:35,280 --> 02:02:37,280
At E3, it was certainly annoying,

2019
02:02:37,280 --> 02:02:40,280
but as we start to get into whatever's next for gaming,

2020
02:02:40,280 --> 02:02:42,280
this type of stuff can really hurt.

2021
02:02:42,280 --> 02:02:45,280
Is that you want to keep features of your machines quiet

2022
02:02:45,280 --> 02:02:48,280
so that your competition doesn't figure out about them,

2023
02:02:48,280 --> 02:02:50,280
but I don't know at the same time.

2024
02:02:50,280 --> 02:02:54,280
A lot of people that work in the game industry stay in the game industry,

2025
02:02:54,280 --> 02:02:56,280
so I would think there's talk amongst people.

2026
02:02:56,280 --> 02:02:59,280
Yes, they all sign NDAs, but I don't think they hold up.

2027
02:02:59,280 --> 02:03:00,280
Sniff out your moles.

2028
02:03:00,280 --> 02:03:04,280
If it's really a big issue for you and you really want to crack down on them,

2029
02:03:04,280 --> 02:03:07,280
start releasing false information,

2030
02:03:07,280 --> 02:03:09,280
and then the people that report on it,

2031
02:03:09,280 --> 02:03:11,280
then you release a different one to each person,

2032
02:03:11,280 --> 02:03:14,280
and the people that report on that, then you know where it came from.

2033
02:03:14,280 --> 02:03:17,280
And then Trenton continues on with this quote.

2034
02:03:17,280 --> 02:03:20,280
This is an industry that has trouble focusing on today.

2035
02:03:20,280 --> 02:03:23,280
We want to constantly talk about tomorrow.

2036
02:03:23,280 --> 02:03:25,280
You have to prepare for people to know things in advance.

2037
02:03:25,280 --> 02:03:28,280
The frustrating thing is they only know a part of the story

2038
02:03:28,280 --> 02:03:31,280
and that opens up a lot of conjecture and misinformation

2039
02:03:31,280 --> 02:03:36,280
that ultimately waters down the reality when you roll it out.

2040
02:03:36,280 --> 02:03:37,280
Really?

2041
02:03:37,280 --> 02:03:40,280
I'm tired of all these podcasters that go on air

2042
02:03:40,280 --> 02:03:43,280
and talk about all the different ways they interpret a patent.

2043
02:03:43,280 --> 02:03:45,280
No, he didn't really say that, but that's the way he's really saying it.

2044
02:03:45,280 --> 02:03:49,280
Really didn't water it down because the PSP Go,

2045
02:03:49,280 --> 02:03:52,280
which has been rumored to be coming out for a while now,

2046
02:03:52,280 --> 02:03:58,280
and then leaked by them, I mean by Sony through Core,

2047
02:03:58,280 --> 02:04:02,280
which really, can you complain about leaks and stuff

2048
02:04:02,280 --> 02:04:06,280
when your own magazine seems to put out the information

2049
02:04:06,280 --> 02:04:08,280
before your present conference?

2050
02:04:08,280 --> 02:04:10,280
Really didn't water it down at all.

2051
02:04:10,280 --> 02:04:12,280
In fact, I don't think it did.

2052
02:04:12,280 --> 02:04:14,280
If anything, it got people's hopes up,

2053
02:04:14,280 --> 02:04:17,280
and then we saw what they announced the features for it,

2054
02:04:17,280 --> 02:04:20,280
and we're like, eh, that sounds stupid.

2055
02:04:20,280 --> 02:04:23,280
It's like, oh, you didn't add a second analog stick?

2056
02:04:23,280 --> 02:04:28,280
Oh, you didn't make it so that, I don't know,

2057
02:04:28,280 --> 02:04:30,280
it does other things other than normal PlayStation?

2058
02:04:30,280 --> 02:04:35,280
Oh, it's not going to be cheaper than the PSP 3000 or something like that?

2059
02:04:35,280 --> 02:04:37,280
It's going to be more expensive? Awesome!

2060
02:04:37,280 --> 02:04:40,280
And most people doing these speculating and rumor mongering

2061
02:04:40,280 --> 02:04:44,280
and blogging on the internet gave the PSP Go the benefit of the doubt.

2062
02:04:44,280 --> 02:04:47,280
A lot of people, ourselves included, when we were on Bobby's show

2063
02:04:47,280 --> 02:04:50,280
and even on our own show talking about the PSP Go,

2064
02:04:50,280 --> 02:04:53,280
what a great entry-level PSP system this is going to be.

2065
02:04:53,280 --> 02:04:56,280
It's going to be a great, cheap device that people are going to use

2066
02:04:56,280 --> 02:04:57,280
and they can get rid of the disks.

2067
02:04:57,280 --> 02:04:59,280
It's going to be cheap, it's going to be easy to use.

2068
02:04:59,280 --> 02:05:05,280
And then, what was the real surprise that we all got slapped with at E3?

2069
02:05:05,280 --> 02:05:08,280
No, I'd like to go on the record saying that I never thought it was a good idea,

2070
02:05:08,280 --> 02:05:13,280
but I did think that the whole not having the UMD drive in there

2071
02:05:13,280 --> 02:05:17,280
was a stupid idea and I couldn't believe that they were that stupid to do that.

2072
02:05:17,280 --> 02:05:19,280
And sure enough, they were that stupid.

2073
02:05:19,280 --> 02:05:21,280
Look, I don't think that's a stupid idea.

2074
02:05:21,280 --> 02:05:25,280
I think it's a fine idea and this whole PSP Go is a fine system,

2075
02:05:25,280 --> 02:05:27,280
but not for $250.

2076
02:05:27,280 --> 02:05:29,280
That price point ruined the whole thing.

2077
02:05:29,280 --> 02:05:31,280
And that was the only surprise that they kept under wraps.

2078
02:05:31,280 --> 02:05:34,280
That's sort of like deja vu if you think about it.

2079
02:05:34,280 --> 02:05:36,280
The price point ruined the whole thing.

2080
02:05:36,280 --> 02:05:41,280
$600 PS3. The price point ruined the whole thing.

2081
02:05:41,280 --> 02:05:45,280
Oh, but it has Blu-Ray and it's $600.

2082
02:05:45,280 --> 02:05:50,280
So whoever is determining what the prices should be at Sony needs to wake the fuck up, basically, is what it is.

2083
02:05:50,280 --> 02:05:55,280
And stop eating crayons, Jamie is yelling from the kitchen.

2084
02:05:55,280 --> 02:06:01,280
Isn't the door supposed to be shut while recording is in progress? No, I'm kidding.

2085
02:06:01,280 --> 02:06:05,280
Alright, if you want to comment on this, 1877 Game OLR,

2086
02:06:05,280 --> 02:06:13,280
looking at some comments in chat, Game Guru says cheap is the term that Sony needs to learn.

2087
02:06:13,280 --> 02:06:17,280
D5T says moving to flash-based media is the future.

2088
02:06:17,280 --> 02:06:19,280
Movable parts are old.

2089
02:06:19,280 --> 02:06:21,280
See, I'm almost with him here.

2090
02:06:21,280 --> 02:06:26,280
I mean, you can't say Sony, screw you, for losing UMD when you're also watching on the same token.

2091
02:06:26,280 --> 02:06:31,280
Microsoft's now getting into digital distribution with the whole classic Xbox 360 games,

2092
02:06:31,280 --> 02:06:35,280
or I'm sorry, new Xbox 360 games available for download on the site.

2093
02:06:35,280 --> 02:06:42,280
We were talking in the first half of the show tonight about Xbox possibly launching a cheaper console next year

2094
02:06:42,280 --> 02:06:44,280
that's going to be targeted at the family audience.

2095
02:06:44,280 --> 02:06:49,280
Who's to say that if they do that, this system is going to lose the disk drive completely

2096
02:06:49,280 --> 02:06:55,280
and could possibly be an online-only download thing using the hand-wavy Natal device to make you choose your games?

2097
02:06:55,280 --> 02:06:58,280
It won't work because people like buying stuff.

2098
02:06:58,280 --> 02:07:00,280
They like having the physical disk in their hand.

2099
02:07:00,280 --> 02:07:05,280
And yeah, I know people that have the iPhone stuff go crazy over the App Store because there's everything in there.

2100
02:07:05,280 --> 02:07:07,280
But you know what?

2101
02:07:07,280 --> 02:07:11,280
It's just, if you could go, if it took like disks or something like that,

2102
02:07:11,280 --> 02:07:14,280
I'm sure people would probably want to buy this because you know what?

2103
02:07:14,280 --> 02:07:15,280
You know what you can do with disks?

2104
02:07:15,280 --> 02:07:18,280
You can return them when they don't work.

2105
02:07:18,280 --> 02:07:20,280
You can return them when you don't like them.

2106
02:07:20,280 --> 02:07:23,280
You can return them when you're done with them.

2107
02:07:23,280 --> 02:07:24,280
You can resell them.

2108
02:07:24,280 --> 02:07:27,280
Digital download, you bought it, you're stuck with it.

2109
02:07:27,280 --> 02:07:29,280
If it sucks, too bad. You bought it.

2110
02:07:29,280 --> 02:07:36,280
Dekeman in our chatroom, chat.orangelandtraded.com, says the reason they gave for the price was to compete with the iPhone.

2111
02:07:36,280 --> 02:07:38,280
If Apple can do it, then so can we.

2112
02:07:38,280 --> 02:07:39,280
And the funny thing was they dropped them.

2113
02:07:39,280 --> 02:07:43,280
Basically, they think they can get away with it since people pay for it.

2114
02:07:43,280 --> 02:07:47,280
Apple's tech, they'll pay it for ours.

2115
02:07:47,280 --> 02:07:49,280
Oh, well, whoops.

2116
02:07:49,280 --> 02:07:53,280
It was just announced this week that the iPhone's coming down to $99.

2117
02:07:53,280 --> 02:07:57,280
Now it's going to cost $99 for somebody to get an iPhone.

2118
02:07:57,280 --> 02:08:00,280
Granted, yeah, they're going to have to sign away their life on the two-year contract.

2119
02:08:00,280 --> 02:08:01,280
But guess what?

2120
02:08:01,280 --> 02:08:03,280
Most people don't think about that.

2121
02:08:03,280 --> 02:08:10,280
They just think, ooh, shiny, $99 iPhone, and hey, I'll sign this two-year contract because that's how long I expect this to last anyway.

2122
02:08:10,280 --> 02:08:15,280
And seriously, if Sony didn't see that one coming, they are mentally deficient.

2123
02:08:15,280 --> 02:08:19,280
And whoever did not see that one coming at Sony needs to be fired.

2124
02:08:19,280 --> 02:08:22,280
They have no business working in business.

2125
02:08:22,280 --> 02:08:31,280
A moron walking off the street, my mother, who doesn't even know how to put a CD in a computer, could tell you.

2126
02:08:31,280 --> 02:08:38,280
Apple, I love my mom, but she's technically stupid, and I can say that in the nicest possible way.

2127
02:08:38,280 --> 02:08:48,280
Even my mother knows every June Apple gets up there, parades out Steve Jobs.

2128
02:08:48,280 --> 02:08:51,280
They couldn't do that this year, obviously, with their one more thing.

2129
02:08:51,280 --> 02:08:58,280
Everybody knows Apple upgrades their shit every year and gets people to buy it all over again.

2130
02:08:58,280 --> 02:08:59,280
It works for Apple.

2131
02:08:59,280 --> 02:09:02,280
It is not going to work for Sony at those prices.

2132
02:09:02,280 --> 02:09:08,280
Sony is not Apple, and the other thing, too, is they have a huge following with Apple.

2133
02:09:08,280 --> 02:09:11,280
Sony doesn't quite have that following with the PSP.

2134
02:09:11,280 --> 02:09:20,280
And to be honest, and I really, really hate to say this, there's more features in the iPhone than there are right now in the PSP.

2135
02:09:20,280 --> 02:09:22,280
I mean, it's got a touch screen on it.

2136
02:09:22,280 --> 02:09:26,280
Hell, if they added a touch screen to the PSP, that might be a whole different story.

2137
02:09:26,280 --> 02:09:29,280
Hey, that might be worth picking up, because that's completely different.

2138
02:09:29,280 --> 02:09:37,280
It's going to open up a whole different set of possibilities if they had support with, like, I know it has support now with Bluetooth or something like that.

2139
02:09:37,280 --> 02:09:39,280
Big whoop. Oh, goody.

2140
02:09:39,280 --> 02:09:48,280
And look, and to those that want to make the argument that, well, Apple releases their new toys at high-end prices.

2141
02:09:48,280 --> 02:09:50,280
You know, granted, I'll give you that.

2142
02:09:50,280 --> 02:09:53,280
Their laptops, I don't think I'm going to buy another Apple laptop.

2143
02:09:53,280 --> 02:09:56,280
They are too expensive for what you get.

2144
02:09:56,280 --> 02:09:58,280
For someone like me.

2145
02:09:58,280 --> 02:10:01,280
Your mic's not on, dear.

2146
02:10:01,280 --> 02:10:03,280
Oh, shit.

2147
02:10:03,280 --> 02:10:17,280
I went to talking with some other people in the art industry, you know, and a couple people were actually saying that they were noticing that there's not as much need for people to have a Mac these days.

2148
02:10:17,280 --> 02:10:25,280
In the industry, now that the PCs are catching up and, you know, different programs are saying, hey, people actually use PCs, you know.

2149
02:10:25,280 --> 02:10:29,280
So even that edge is starting to blur a little bit.

2150
02:10:29,280 --> 02:10:33,280
I think Apple's in for a rude awakening in the laptop market within the next couple years.

2151
02:10:33,280 --> 02:10:35,280
But they've got it on the iPhone.

2152
02:10:35,280 --> 02:10:38,280
I mean, you know, Apple right now is a phone company.

2153
02:10:38,280 --> 02:10:40,280
That is what Apple is doing best.

2154
02:10:40,280 --> 02:10:42,280
They are a phone and music company.

2155
02:10:42,280 --> 02:10:45,280
They don't really, well, God, I'm going to get so much hate mail for this.

2156
02:10:45,280 --> 02:10:54,280
But look, as somebody who's going out there wanting to get a new laptop and so forth, I cannot look at these two things.

2157
02:10:54,280 --> 02:10:57,280
Like you look at a Mac laptop over here and then a PC that does all the same stuff.

2158
02:10:57,280 --> 02:10:59,280
I can't continue to do that anymore.

2159
02:10:59,280 --> 02:11:02,280
However, Apple has it nailed on the iPhone.

2160
02:11:02,280 --> 02:11:06,280
$199 for their newest model, the 3GS.

2161
02:11:06,280 --> 02:11:09,280
Granted, yes, you're signing these contracts, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

2162
02:11:09,280 --> 02:11:10,280
People are probably going to do it anyway.

2163
02:11:10,280 --> 02:11:15,280
But look, you have the $199 iPhone, the $249 PSP Go.

2164
02:11:15,280 --> 02:11:17,280
I can watch movies on both.

2165
02:11:17,280 --> 02:11:18,280
Check.

2166
02:11:18,280 --> 02:11:19,280
I can get on the internet with both.

2167
02:11:19,280 --> 02:11:20,280
Check.

2168
02:11:20,280 --> 02:11:21,280
I can play music on both.

2169
02:11:21,280 --> 02:11:22,280
Check.

2170
02:11:22,280 --> 02:11:25,280
I can play games on both that I download online.

2171
02:11:25,280 --> 02:11:26,280
Check.

2172
02:11:26,280 --> 02:11:31,280
The only thing the Sony PSP has got is that the games are of a higher caliber than the ones you see on the iPhone.

2173
02:11:31,280 --> 02:11:32,280
I will give it that.

2174
02:11:32,280 --> 02:11:44,280
Right now, and supposedly the 3GS has better specs or something than the 3G, so maybe they will be a little bit better later on.

2175
02:11:44,280 --> 02:11:51,280
And it also doesn't have actual control pads, so that does kind of limit them as far as games go.

2176
02:11:51,280 --> 02:11:59,280
Rama in chat says, Rob Roberts, everything you have done on your MacBook can be done on a $500 PC laptop flawlessly.

2177
02:11:59,280 --> 02:12:01,280
That's what I'm starting to find out, too.

2178
02:12:01,280 --> 02:12:05,280
And part of what I loved about Macs is that they were so easy, you know, so great.

2179
02:12:05,280 --> 02:12:06,280
But here's the nice thing.

2180
02:12:06,280 --> 02:12:12,280
Finally, someone at Microsoft kind of wised up, oh my gosh, Apple's starting to bite into us a little bit here with this whole...

2181
02:12:12,280 --> 02:12:14,280
I think they're making it easier.

2182
02:12:14,280 --> 02:12:15,280
I don't know.

2183
02:12:15,280 --> 02:12:17,280
I'm going to open up this whole can of worms on the computer debate.

2184
02:12:17,280 --> 02:12:18,280
That's not what I want to do.

2185
02:12:18,280 --> 02:12:26,280
I want to talk about the PSP Go and all this stuff, you know, and the whole fact that it's $249 is way too much to be charging for that.

2186
02:12:26,280 --> 02:12:28,280
Actually, that wasn't even really originally what I wanted to talk about.

2187
02:12:28,280 --> 02:12:33,280
It was supposed to be about keeping secrets in the industry and people not respecting confidentiality in the industry.

2188
02:12:33,280 --> 02:12:44,280
Is that, you know, there's this fine line here where people want to know everything.

2189
02:12:44,280 --> 02:12:45,280
You know what I mean?

2190
02:12:45,280 --> 02:12:51,280
And there's such a real dog-eat-dog thing in the media and these blogs right now.

2191
02:12:51,280 --> 02:12:53,280
Every blog wants to be first.

2192
02:12:53,280 --> 02:12:55,280
Every blog wants to have the exclusive.

2193
02:12:55,280 --> 02:13:02,280
Blogs get pissed off when other blogs steal their stories that were an exclusive and so on and all of this.

2194
02:13:02,280 --> 02:13:07,280
How much is too much in regards to confidentiality?

2195
02:13:07,280 --> 02:13:09,280
I mean, the demand is out there.

2196
02:13:09,280 --> 02:13:10,280
People want to know.

2197
02:13:10,280 --> 02:13:14,280
The millisecond these things are thought of, Sony is even thinking about doing this.

2198
02:13:14,280 --> 02:13:16,280
People want to know about it.

2199
02:13:16,280 --> 02:13:19,280
How far is too far with this whole confidentiality?

2200
02:13:19,280 --> 02:13:20,280
Did this go too far?

2201
02:13:20,280 --> 02:13:25,280
Did the PSP go getting announced early and a lot of these other things, was that too far?

2202
02:13:25,280 --> 02:13:27,280
I don't know.

2203
02:13:27,280 --> 02:13:28,280
I don't have an easy answer for this.

2204
02:13:28,280 --> 02:13:29,280
Then don't tell these people.

2205
02:13:29,280 --> 02:13:32,280
If you want to keep a secret, you don't say anything.

2206
02:13:32,280 --> 02:13:36,280
You don't keep a secret by saying, go and tell 100 people.

2207
02:13:36,280 --> 02:13:37,280
Oh, by the way, don't tell anybody this.

2208
02:13:37,280 --> 02:13:41,280
But don't you have to tell your developers that they're going to be making the games?

2209
02:13:41,280 --> 02:13:45,280
Well, obviously someone else is blogging about it and leaking this stuff out.

2210
02:13:45,280 --> 02:13:50,280
You have people that are leaking out stuff all the time and they can hide behind the Internet.

2211
02:13:50,280 --> 02:13:51,280
They can be whomever.

2212
02:13:51,280 --> 02:13:56,280
They can be some industry mole and go on the record and stuff.

2213
02:13:56,280 --> 02:14:04,280
And they probably get some sort of joy out of having the exclusive story that no one knows about.

2214
02:14:04,280 --> 02:14:07,280
I mean, we've kind of also seen the other side of that too.

2215
02:14:07,280 --> 02:14:11,280
We once blew somebody's exclusive and they threatened to cut us off at the balls.

2216
02:14:11,280 --> 02:14:14,280
And it was kind of one of these things where it's like, well, wait a minute.

2217
02:14:14,280 --> 02:14:17,280
How come all these other people can get away with it?

2218
02:14:17,280 --> 02:14:25,280
And we've also seen it in the past too with NDAs where other people are given preferential treatment

2219
02:14:25,280 --> 02:14:30,280
because they're a big website and they're going to run an exclusive story.

2220
02:14:30,280 --> 02:14:33,280
Oh, let's decide which website gets to run the exclusive story.

2221
02:14:33,280 --> 02:14:38,280
And that's the shit that needs to stop right now because that's just encouraging people to one-up others.

2222
02:14:38,280 --> 02:14:40,280
I'm sorry. No pun intended.

2223
02:14:40,280 --> 02:14:45,280
Anyhow, let's move on.

2224
02:14:45,280 --> 02:14:49,280
See, now they're getting into the PC Mac debate and chat and I'm so sorry I opened that can of worms.

2225
02:14:49,280 --> 02:14:51,280
Look, buy what you like, like what you like.

2226
02:14:51,280 --> 02:14:53,280
Just have fun with it.

2227
02:14:53,280 --> 02:14:57,280
It's your money.

2228
02:14:57,280 --> 02:14:59,280
Buy whatever you want.

2229
02:14:59,280 --> 02:15:05,280
All I'm saying is that from my perspective right now as an average laptop user who wants to use Internet and all this stuff,

2230
02:15:05,280 --> 02:15:08,280
I've bought the MacBook before and it broke.

2231
02:15:08,280 --> 02:15:10,280
I thought Macs were never supposed to break.

2232
02:15:10,280 --> 02:15:13,280
They were supposed to be infallible machines that never get viruses and so forth.

2233
02:15:13,280 --> 02:15:16,280
And now I'm sitting here and I've really had to reevaluate this whole thing.

2234
02:15:16,280 --> 02:15:19,280
Is it worth it for me to spend that much on a computer again?

2235
02:15:19,280 --> 02:15:21,280
And for the things I want to do, I don't think it is.

2236
02:15:21,280 --> 02:15:25,280
Not until the apples come way down in price to be competitive with the PCs.

2237
02:15:25,280 --> 02:15:27,280
That's what I'm saying.

2238
02:15:27,280 --> 02:15:31,280
And removing features to cut costs is not an answer, Apple.

2239
02:15:31,280 --> 02:15:34,280
So, anyhow, sorry.

2240
02:15:34,280 --> 02:15:36,280
I apologize for getting completely off track.

2241
02:15:36,280 --> 02:15:38,280
Let's get back to video games.

2242
02:15:38,280 --> 02:15:40,280
Oh, what a video game on the next story, correct?

2243
02:15:40,280 --> 02:15:51,280
Yes. Of course, this is a classic and a remade game now coming to Xbox Live Arcade as an exclusive for a limited time.

2244
02:15:51,280 --> 02:15:57,280
That would be, of course, the brand new, or I guess, brand new remake.

2245
02:15:57,280 --> 02:16:02,280
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Turtles in Time re-shelled, which looks pretty awesome, actually.

2246
02:16:02,280 --> 02:16:10,280
Completely redone 3D and, of course, will be available on Xbox Live Arcade July 22nd.

2247
02:16:10,280 --> 02:16:17,280
But, as for the PlayStation Network, later this year.

2248
02:16:17,280 --> 02:16:24,280
Well, I guess that's pretty cool that the games got dated and so forth, but how about the whole exclusive window thing?

2249
02:16:24,280 --> 02:16:26,280
I mean, is this another blow to Sony?

2250
02:16:26,280 --> 02:16:36,280
Is this simply a limit of, I don't know, are they saying that they actually have bought the timed exclusive window to this?

2251
02:16:36,280 --> 02:16:37,280
No.

2252
02:16:37,280 --> 02:16:40,280
Or is there some underlying technical problem that's causing this to be delayed on Sony?

2253
02:16:40,280 --> 02:16:41,280
I don't think there's a technical problem at all.

2254
02:16:41,280 --> 02:16:49,280
I think it's a deal, because if you think about it, this is actually part of the Summer of Live, or the Live Arcade Summer of Arcade, whatever the hell they're calling that.

2255
02:16:49,280 --> 02:16:56,280
So, they're gonna get an extra marketing push because of that, and probably the deal was that they gotta put it out later because of that.

2256
02:16:56,280 --> 02:16:58,280
What marketing push?

2257
02:16:58,280 --> 02:17:04,280
I mean, really, is being in the Summer of Arcade that much of a boost to sales?

2258
02:17:04,280 --> 02:17:05,280
It might be.

2259
02:17:05,280 --> 02:17:06,280
Really?

2260
02:17:06,280 --> 02:17:09,280
What do they do? What's the big deal about being in the Summer of Arcade?

2261
02:17:09,280 --> 02:17:13,280
The fact that they cluster a lot of highly anticipated games all together.

2262
02:17:13,280 --> 02:17:19,280
But for most Xbox Live Arcade games, I can think of anything I've anticipated, I knew where to seek it out and buy it.

2263
02:17:19,280 --> 02:17:22,280
Do they run extra ads in magazines?

2264
02:17:22,280 --> 02:17:25,280
They have a splash trailer thing or something, I don't know.

2265
02:17:25,280 --> 02:17:28,280
I guess. It just doesn't seem like that much of a boost.

2266
02:17:28,280 --> 02:17:30,280
Well, I'm just speculating, I don't know.

2267
02:17:30,280 --> 02:17:34,280
Maybe they had trouble developing on the PlayStation Network. I don't know what it is.

2268
02:17:34,280 --> 02:17:37,280
I don't think they would because Ubisoft would imagine.

2269
02:17:37,280 --> 02:17:39,280
Well, they're publishing it. Who knows who's developing it?

2270
02:17:39,280 --> 02:17:43,280
I mean, I don't know.

2271
02:17:43,280 --> 02:17:47,280
It could be something retarded. It probably is something retarded.

2272
02:17:47,280 --> 02:17:50,280
But you know what? Just get used to it.

2273
02:17:50,280 --> 02:17:52,280
I need to see more of this game in action.

2274
02:17:52,280 --> 02:17:58,280
So it's just pretty much a port of the old arcade game, but with those kind of cooler, upgraded graphics?

2275
02:17:58,280 --> 02:17:59,280
Yeah.

2276
02:17:59,280 --> 02:18:01,280
Huh. I guess that's kind of neat.

2277
02:18:01,280 --> 02:18:06,280
I know there's a lot of folks in our chat room that are anticipating the whole Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles game.

2278
02:18:06,280 --> 02:18:11,280
Of course, they're still arguing about PCs and Macs, so I don't really have a lot of comments to read.

2279
02:18:11,280 --> 02:18:13,280
Hey, I don't have to say anything anymore.

2280
02:18:13,280 --> 02:18:15,280
Hold on, let's see. Rama in chat says,

2281
02:18:15,280 --> 02:18:19,280
Super NES exclusive. Wasn't the Super Famicom version a direct port?

2282
02:18:19,280 --> 02:18:21,280
I don't know what game they're even talking about there.

2283
02:18:21,280 --> 02:18:22,280
Maybe Turtles.

2284
02:18:22,280 --> 02:18:25,280
Oh, it must be the same thing. Oh yeah, because Marin said earlier,

2285
02:18:25,280 --> 02:18:28,280
just play your Super Nintendo copy of the game like I will.

2286
02:18:28,280 --> 02:18:33,280
I guess, yeah, this whole timed exclusive thing does go back a little bit even to the days of Super Nintendo and Genesis.

2287
02:18:33,280 --> 02:18:37,280
Mortal Kombat was out on the Super Nintendo for a while before the Genesis, right? Am I right?

2288
02:18:37,280 --> 02:18:42,280
I know Street Fighter was, but then when it came out on the Genesis, they got, ooh, Championship Edition.

2289
02:18:42,280 --> 02:18:46,280
And that whole thing. Maybe they did come out at the same time. I think I was thinking of Street Fighter.

2290
02:18:46,280 --> 02:18:49,280
It was a long time ago.

2291
02:18:49,280 --> 02:18:54,280
And then Dark Tetsuya says, I forget, I just remember the Super Nintendo version having the extra levels and bosses.

2292
02:18:54,280 --> 02:18:57,280
Ooh, are we getting some of that in this? Extra levels and stuff?

2293
02:18:57,280 --> 02:18:58,280
There might be extra levels.

2294
02:18:58,280 --> 02:19:03,280
I mean, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles was a pretty huge Xbox Live game when it came out anyway.

2295
02:19:03,280 --> 02:19:07,280
Folks playing it online and having fun on Live with it, so I'm sure this is going to be no different.

2296
02:19:07,280 --> 02:19:08,280
I'm sure it'll be fun.

2297
02:19:08,280 --> 02:19:09,280
Yeah.

2298
02:19:09,280 --> 02:19:10,280
So, there you go.

2299
02:19:10,280 --> 02:19:17,280
Alright, well that game will be coming out July 22nd, I believe it was, so keep an eye out for that.

2300
02:19:17,280 --> 02:19:20,280
Moving on with more news, Metal Gear Solid Rising.

2301
02:19:20,280 --> 02:19:26,280
Of course, this was the whole moment at E3 where they came out at the Microsoft press conference.

2302
02:19:26,280 --> 02:19:32,280
The Xbox is getting Metal Gear Solid Rising.

2303
02:19:32,280 --> 02:19:35,280
And a lot of people were waiting for it, the whole Metal Gear Solid 4 thing.

2304
02:19:35,280 --> 02:19:40,280
Of course, now it should be noted, Metal Gear Solid Rising is not exclusive to the Xbox.

2305
02:19:40,280 --> 02:19:43,280
It's going on Xbox and PlayStation.

2306
02:19:43,280 --> 02:19:46,280
And a lot of folks are saying, well, it's going to still be.

2307
02:19:46,280 --> 02:19:49,280
It's like Metal Gear is continuing on or what have you.

2308
02:19:49,280 --> 02:19:54,280
But, apparently, it is a whole new engine for Metal Gear Solid Rising.

2309
02:19:54,280 --> 02:20:01,280
If you're thinking this is Metal Gear Solid 4 Plus or some game that was made in Metal Gear Solid 4's engine, uh-uh.

2310
02:20:01,280 --> 02:20:09,280
Sean Eyestone, who is an assistant producer at Kojima Productions, says the team is remaking Rising's engine from scratch.

2311
02:20:09,280 --> 02:20:15,280
Their goal, I should say, to make it look better than Metal Gear Solid 4.

2312
02:20:15,280 --> 02:20:20,280
And this is from a Kojima Productions podcast that came out this week.

2313
02:20:20,280 --> 02:20:24,280
Apparently, they are saying it is a big project like Metal Gear Solid 4.

2314
02:20:24,280 --> 02:20:29,280
The team is serious about making it look as good as possible on every platform.

2315
02:20:29,280 --> 02:20:31,280
That's kind of cool.

2316
02:20:31,280 --> 02:20:33,280
I mean, who cares? So what?

2317
02:20:33,280 --> 02:20:37,280
So Metal Gear Solid 4 came out and was exclusive to the Sony.

2318
02:20:37,280 --> 02:20:39,280
Good for them. How well is it selling now?

2319
02:20:39,280 --> 02:20:42,280
Still okay, but not what it used to be selling.

2320
02:20:42,280 --> 02:20:47,280
I don't think anyone is buying the system nowadays from Metal Gear Solid 4.

2321
02:20:47,280 --> 02:20:56,280
And now it's coming out on both systems, because I think they know that it would be a mistake to skip on the 360.

2322
02:20:56,280 --> 02:21:01,280
Because there is a lot of potential sales there, especially now that they didn't have Metal Gear Solid 4.

2323
02:21:01,280 --> 02:21:04,280
And so they're going to get a lot more money out of it.

2324
02:21:04,280 --> 02:21:07,280
And it's all about money nowadays, because times are tough.

2325
02:21:07,280 --> 02:21:10,280
So I'm not surprised.

2326
02:21:10,280 --> 02:21:12,280
And I am... I don't know.

2327
02:21:12,280 --> 02:21:15,280
It'd be weird if they kind of went in the opposite direction.

2328
02:21:15,280 --> 02:21:19,280
But it makes sense to them, just to put it out on both systems.

2329
02:21:19,280 --> 02:21:22,280
The Rob D. in chat, by the way, says,

2330
02:21:22,280 --> 02:21:25,280
So we're going from talking about a turtles game to talking about Solid Snakes.

2331
02:21:25,280 --> 02:21:27,280
What does this show become?

2332
02:21:27,280 --> 02:21:29,280
It has this reptile jungle tonight on Orange Lawns Radio, apparently.

2333
02:21:29,280 --> 02:21:33,280
Chat.orangelawnsradio.com if you want to make a smart ass comment like that one.

2334
02:21:33,280 --> 02:21:40,280
But, you know, I guess at first, when I first heard about this, I was like,

2335
02:21:40,280 --> 02:21:44,280
Oh, they're cranking this game out so fast because Metal Gear Solid 4,

2336
02:21:44,280 --> 02:21:46,280
they're just going to reuse that engine, and so forth.

2337
02:21:46,280 --> 02:21:49,280
But now, that doesn't seem to be the case.

2338
02:21:49,280 --> 02:21:53,280
So, you could look at this a couple of ways.

2339
02:21:53,280 --> 02:21:54,280
I get really excited when I hear,

2340
02:21:54,280 --> 02:21:57,280
Oh, they're going to make it look even better, and so forth.

2341
02:21:57,280 --> 02:22:00,280
But weren't they saying one of the reasons that they didn't port

2342
02:22:00,280 --> 02:22:03,280
Metal Gear Solid 4 to the Xbox 360?

2343
02:22:03,280 --> 02:22:06,280
And let's face it, folks, they never will at this point.

2344
02:22:06,280 --> 02:22:07,280
It is not happening.

2345
02:22:07,280 --> 02:22:08,280
This is what you're getting.

2346
02:22:08,280 --> 02:22:10,280
Be happy with this, Microsoft fans.

2347
02:22:10,280 --> 02:22:13,280
There is not Metal Gear Solid 4 coming into the Xbox 360.

2348
02:22:13,280 --> 02:22:17,280
If that was ever going to happen, it would have been announced before this.

2349
02:22:17,280 --> 02:22:21,280
So, that being said, is it possible,

2350
02:22:21,280 --> 02:22:25,280
they said that Metal Gear Solid 4 would not be ported to the Xbox 360

2351
02:22:25,280 --> 02:22:28,280
because it was made for Blu-ray.

2352
02:22:28,280 --> 02:22:31,280
The types of graphics that were on it and everything that was packed in that disk

2353
02:22:31,280 --> 02:22:33,280
was made for Blu-ray.

2354
02:22:33,280 --> 02:22:36,280
So that makes me think, OK, well then by that argument,

2355
02:22:36,280 --> 02:22:40,280
if they're scaling this back to fit every platform,

2356
02:22:40,280 --> 02:22:43,280
they're going to have to scale it back, not make it better.

2357
02:22:43,280 --> 02:22:44,280
Wrong.

2358
02:22:44,280 --> 02:22:47,280
And this goes back to what we were talking about earlier.

2359
02:22:47,280 --> 02:22:50,280
Metal Gear Solid 4 was going to max out the PS3,

2360
02:22:50,280 --> 02:22:53,280
but now they've learned that they can optimize their code.

2361
02:22:53,280 --> 02:22:54,280
There's different techniques.

2362
02:22:54,280 --> 02:22:56,280
And to be honest, their excuse was,

2363
02:22:56,280 --> 02:22:59,280
Oh, it's so big it can only fit on Blu-ray.

2364
02:22:59,280 --> 02:23:03,280
But at the same time, oh, and no one wants to swap disks, by the way,

2365
02:23:03,280 --> 02:23:06,280
which is retarded because there's a five-minute install

2366
02:23:06,280 --> 02:23:09,280
between sections of the game.

2367
02:23:09,280 --> 02:23:10,280
I mean, come on.

2368
02:23:10,280 --> 02:23:12,280
They could have easily swapped disks.

2369
02:23:12,280 --> 02:23:14,280
I'd rather spend two seconds to swap a disk

2370
02:23:14,280 --> 02:23:18,280
than to spend five minutes loading a section of the game to my hard drive.

2371
02:23:18,280 --> 02:23:20,280
And if I really wanted to do that with multiple disks,

2372
02:23:20,280 --> 02:23:24,280
I could do that now in the new Microsoft interface.

2373
02:23:24,280 --> 02:23:26,280
I can install each portion if I wanted to.

2374
02:23:26,280 --> 02:23:28,280
TigerKlonChat makes a really good point.

2375
02:23:28,280 --> 02:23:31,280
It says, also notice Metal Gear Solid Rising says,

2376
02:23:31,280 --> 02:23:32,280
Lightning Bolt action.

2377
02:23:32,280 --> 02:23:34,280
Maybe it's a new type of gameplay.

2378
02:23:34,280 --> 02:23:38,280
Given that Raiden is a ninja, it could very well be a hack and slash game.

2379
02:23:38,280 --> 02:23:41,280
Have we had anything confirmed that this is a stealth action game

2380
02:23:41,280 --> 02:23:43,280
like the other Metal Gear Solid games?

2381
02:23:43,280 --> 02:23:45,280
Or is TigerKlon to something here?

2382
02:23:45,280 --> 02:23:47,280
Because it's not Metal Gear Solid 5.

2383
02:23:47,280 --> 02:23:50,280
It's Metal Gear Solid Rising.

2384
02:23:50,280 --> 02:23:53,280
Maybe the type of game we're anticipating here should be,

2385
02:23:53,280 --> 02:23:55,280
maybe we need to set our expectations for something different.

2386
02:23:55,280 --> 02:23:58,280
Maybe we're looking at an action game, a beat-em-up.

2387
02:23:58,280 --> 02:23:59,280
I don't know about that.

2388
02:23:59,280 --> 02:24:03,280
Turtles in Time version of Metal Gear Solid.

2389
02:24:03,280 --> 02:24:05,280
I don't know about that far.

2390
02:24:05,280 --> 02:24:07,280
But that is interesting that it doesn't say anything

2391
02:24:07,280 --> 02:24:10,280
about the whole stealth, it's lightning bolt action.

2392
02:24:13,280 --> 02:24:16,280
Do you think that would be as successful if they change up the genre?

2393
02:24:19,280 --> 02:24:21,280
Maybe. Maybe not.

2394
02:24:21,280 --> 02:24:23,280
I guess it just depends on how good the game is.

2395
02:24:23,280 --> 02:24:25,280
I think people will bitch and moan, but they'll probably still buy it

2396
02:24:25,280 --> 02:24:27,280
because they're Metal Gear Solid fans.

2397
02:24:27,280 --> 02:24:28,280
Perhaps.

2398
02:24:28,280 --> 02:24:29,280
Alright, we'll see.

2399
02:24:29,280 --> 02:24:31,280
Let's continue on with some more news.

2400
02:24:31,280 --> 02:24:35,280
If you want to call us on this or any topic we're talking about,

2401
02:24:35,280 --> 02:24:37,280
give us a call at 1-877-GAME-OLR.

2402
02:24:37,280 --> 02:24:38,280
We haven't had a phone call in a little while.

2403
02:24:38,280 --> 02:24:39,280
Don't be shy.

2404
02:24:39,280 --> 02:24:41,280
Give us a call at 1-877-GAME-OLR.

2405
02:24:41,280 --> 02:24:46,280
Well, Xbox Live community games, they're getting a little bit of a facelift.

2406
02:24:46,280 --> 02:24:50,280
Starting in late July, Xbox Live community games

2407
02:24:50,280 --> 02:24:56,280
will now be changing to Xbox Live Indie games.

2408
02:24:56,280 --> 02:25:00,280
And apparently it's in response to community feedback

2409
02:25:00,280 --> 02:25:05,280
in order to increase understanding and promote the games.

2410
02:25:05,280 --> 02:25:09,280
So they're going to launch XNA Game Studio 3.1.

2411
02:25:09,280 --> 02:25:18,280
And apparently the game creators have, I guess they want to change

2412
02:25:18,280 --> 02:25:20,280
the appearance of the community games.

2413
02:25:20,280 --> 02:25:23,280
And indie games, it makes more sense.

2414
02:25:23,280 --> 02:25:26,280
Because community games, you kind of think of games made out of someone's garage.

2415
02:25:26,280 --> 02:25:30,280
Whereas indie games, you know, indie movies, sometimes they're gems

2416
02:25:30,280 --> 02:25:33,280
and they're just created with lower budget.

2417
02:25:33,280 --> 02:25:36,280
Maybe indie games will kind of give off that impression

2418
02:25:36,280 --> 02:25:41,280
that it's just going to be good games with lower budget.

2419
02:25:41,280 --> 02:25:44,280
I don't know about you, but I look at the XNA stuff

2420
02:25:44,280 --> 02:25:46,280
and there's a lot of it that sucks out there.

2421
02:25:46,280 --> 02:25:48,280
And there's a lot of stuff on there now.

2422
02:25:48,280 --> 02:25:51,280
I mean, a ton of things that you can play.

2423
02:25:51,280 --> 02:25:53,280
And a lot of them are really good.

2424
02:25:53,280 --> 02:25:56,280
But a lot of them are really, really bad.

2425
02:25:56,280 --> 02:25:59,280
What do you think about this whole rating system that's coming into the games?

2426
02:25:59,280 --> 02:26:01,280
Is this going to be a good thing or a bad thing?

2427
02:26:01,280 --> 02:26:02,280
I think it's a good thing.

2428
02:26:02,280 --> 02:26:06,280
It'll be able to separate the crap from the not-crap.

2429
02:26:06,280 --> 02:26:09,280
And I would love to see user-rated stuff.

2430
02:26:09,280 --> 02:26:12,280
So I can look at these games that people think are great.

2431
02:26:12,280 --> 02:26:16,280
Maybe have a way that you can see what your friends rate it or something like that.

2432
02:26:16,280 --> 02:26:18,280
So if I have similar tastes to, say, Rob,

2433
02:26:18,280 --> 02:26:21,280
I can play the games that he likes or something like that.

2434
02:26:21,280 --> 02:26:22,280
Now that's a good idea.

2435
02:26:22,280 --> 02:26:26,280
Maybe what I'm worried about with ratings is that in theory it sounds like a good idea.

2436
02:26:26,280 --> 02:26:27,280
But do you know what I'm worried about?

2437
02:26:27,280 --> 02:26:29,280
The dig effect.

2438
02:26:29,280 --> 02:26:33,280
You know how stories get bumped to the top of dig.com that you're like,

2439
02:26:33,280 --> 02:26:34,280
why the hell is this here?

2440
02:26:34,280 --> 02:26:38,280
And it's because so-and-so has millions of friends that will dig up the story for them.

2441
02:26:38,280 --> 02:26:41,280
And to be fair, we've had it happen to our stories before,

2442
02:26:41,280 --> 02:26:43,280
and I'm sure that's thanks to our OL Army.

2443
02:26:43,280 --> 02:26:44,280
So don't hear me wrong.

2444
02:26:44,280 --> 02:26:47,280
It's not necessarily a bad thing or whatever.

2445
02:26:47,280 --> 02:26:52,280
I would be worried in regards to this context of the whole indie games is that

2446
02:26:52,280 --> 02:26:57,280
what if a game maker whose game isn't really good

2447
02:26:57,280 --> 02:27:00,280
has 100 friends to go on there and rate it as great.

2448
02:27:00,280 --> 02:27:05,280
That's going to give it exposure it doesn't really deserve, I guess you could say.

2449
02:27:05,280 --> 02:27:07,280
And it's the same thing with iTunes reviews,

2450
02:27:07,280 --> 02:27:10,280
because I went off a couple weeks on the show.

2451
02:27:10,280 --> 02:27:12,280
A couple weeks ago on the show I was going off about,

2452
02:27:12,280 --> 02:27:16,280
I'm pissed off that somebody would actually take the time to write a negative review

2453
02:27:16,280 --> 02:27:19,280
about our show and post it with all the...

2454
02:27:19,280 --> 02:27:25,280
Granted, if somebody's saying things that have merit and real constructive criticism,

2455
02:27:25,280 --> 02:27:26,280
then I would shut up.

2456
02:27:26,280 --> 02:27:29,280
Then I would take the criticism and see what we can do with that.

2457
02:27:29,280 --> 02:27:35,280
But it sucks that somebody who might be a fan of some other show

2458
02:27:35,280 --> 02:27:38,280
who doesn't know how to support any podcasting,

2459
02:27:38,280 --> 02:27:40,280
who deserves to have karma bite him in the ass or something,

2460
02:27:40,280 --> 02:27:43,280
can have somebody go around and rate a bunch of other shows a 1

2461
02:27:43,280 --> 02:27:46,280
and no action gets taken against that user.

2462
02:27:46,280 --> 02:27:50,280
That user's opinion carries just as much weight

2463
02:27:50,280 --> 02:27:52,280
as somebody who actually thinks out their reviews.

2464
02:27:52,280 --> 02:27:54,280
Does that make any sense at all what I'm saying?

2465
02:27:54,280 --> 02:27:55,280
Yeah, it makes sense.

2466
02:27:55,280 --> 02:27:58,280
I would fear that just because somebody has a lot of friends,

2467
02:27:58,280 --> 02:28:01,280
their game gets all this extra exposure.

2468
02:28:01,280 --> 02:28:04,280
And you look at the top shows on iTunes,

2469
02:28:04,280 --> 02:28:05,280
again going back to iTunes, sorry,

2470
02:28:05,280 --> 02:28:07,280
but it's something I feel pretty passionate about.

2471
02:28:07,280 --> 02:28:09,280
You look at all the top shows on iTunes,

2472
02:28:09,280 --> 02:28:14,280
most of them are 1Ups, IGNs, Game Spots, G4s,

2473
02:28:14,280 --> 02:28:17,280
commercial, down your throat type fare.

2474
02:28:17,280 --> 02:28:20,280
And it kind of sucks for the rest of us

2475
02:28:20,280 --> 02:28:23,280
when podcasts were supposed to be an indie thing.

2476
02:28:23,280 --> 02:28:26,280
Until the mainstream jumped on board

2477
02:28:26,280 --> 02:28:30,280
because they saw it as a way to reach out to the community.

2478
02:28:30,280 --> 02:28:33,280
And now podcasts are everywhere.

2479
02:28:33,280 --> 02:28:37,280
And then at the same time, taking it a step further,

2480
02:28:37,280 --> 02:28:40,280
somebody who has the 100 friends that are willing to do

2481
02:28:40,280 --> 02:28:44,280
whatever they say or whatever, go and spam this game a 1

2482
02:28:44,280 --> 02:28:47,280
just because they don't like the person that made it

2483
02:28:47,280 --> 02:28:48,280
or what have you.

2484
02:28:48,280 --> 02:28:51,280
Or there's a competing game in the genre

2485
02:28:51,280 --> 02:28:53,280
that they don't want to have more exposure.

2486
02:28:53,280 --> 02:28:57,280
I could just see this ratings thing used for bad purposes.

2487
02:28:57,280 --> 02:29:00,280
And I hope there's a way, like you're saying, Loki,

2488
02:29:00,280 --> 02:29:03,280
to either see what my friends rated games

2489
02:29:03,280 --> 02:29:06,280
and only base my judgment off what my friends think of games

2490
02:29:06,280 --> 02:29:08,280
and maybe not the community as a whole,

2491
02:29:08,280 --> 02:29:12,280
or rate the raters would be a great thing.

2492
02:29:12,280 --> 02:29:13,280
Rate the raters.

2493
02:29:13,280 --> 02:29:15,280
That's something they need to bring to iTunes,

2494
02:29:15,280 --> 02:29:16,280
is rating the raters.

2495
02:29:16,280 --> 02:29:18,280
And you kind of can too a little bit.

2496
02:29:18,280 --> 02:29:20,280
You can say, was this comment helpful?

2497
02:29:20,280 --> 02:29:21,280
Yes or no.

2498
02:29:21,280 --> 02:29:24,280
But it really doesn't have any bearing on the author as a whole.

2499
02:29:24,280 --> 02:29:26,280
I think that's something I would like to see,

2500
02:29:26,280 --> 02:29:28,280
is you rate the rater.

2501
02:29:28,280 --> 02:29:30,280
And as the rater's rating goes up,

2502
02:29:30,280 --> 02:29:32,280
their rating carries more weight.

2503
02:29:32,280 --> 02:29:34,280
And as it goes down, it loses weight.

2504
02:29:34,280 --> 02:29:36,280
That's what I'd like to see.

2505
02:29:36,280 --> 02:29:38,280
That was a lot of uses of the word rate.

2506
02:29:38,280 --> 02:29:40,280
Only in the perfect world.

2507
02:29:40,280 --> 02:29:41,280
Yeah.

2508
02:29:41,280 --> 02:29:42,280
But I don't know.

2509
02:29:42,280 --> 02:29:45,280
I kind of think that's the way to do it.

2510
02:29:45,280 --> 02:29:48,280
But yeah, that one indie game you were talking about

2511
02:29:48,280 --> 02:29:50,280
earlier in the show, Attack, or what was it?

2512
02:29:50,280 --> 02:29:51,280
Barry Attack?

2513
02:29:51,280 --> 02:29:52,280
It was Angry Barry.

2514
02:29:52,280 --> 02:29:53,280
Angry Barry.

2515
02:29:53,280 --> 02:29:55,280
And you know where I saw that.

2516
02:29:55,280 --> 02:29:57,280
And I hate to say this, but IGN, actually,

2517
02:29:57,280 --> 02:30:01,280
they do a segment that's a community shower,

2518
02:30:01,280 --> 02:30:02,280
I think is what they call it.

2519
02:30:02,280 --> 02:30:05,280
And basically they cover, you know,

2520
02:30:05,280 --> 02:30:07,280
the last week of community games that came out,

2521
02:30:07,280 --> 02:30:09,280
and the ones that they like and the ones they don't like.

2522
02:30:09,280 --> 02:30:11,280
And that one had a video for it.

2523
02:30:11,280 --> 02:30:14,280
They actually shot a little video for Angry Barry, I think.

2524
02:30:14,280 --> 02:30:15,280
I don't know if they shot it,

2525
02:30:15,280 --> 02:30:17,280
or if they just got a trailer from the website

2526
02:30:17,280 --> 02:30:19,280
or something like that, but that's what it was from.

2527
02:30:19,280 --> 02:30:22,280
And then I went all exciting, you know, and downloaded it,

2528
02:30:22,280 --> 02:30:24,280
only to find out that it's broken.

2529
02:30:24,280 --> 02:30:26,280
So that sucked.

2530
02:30:26,280 --> 02:30:28,280
Marin in chat brings up a good point.

2531
02:30:28,280 --> 02:30:30,280
He says, but what if somebody doesn't agree with the rating person,

2532
02:30:30,280 --> 02:30:33,280
and so they rate the person lowly based on their opinion,

2533
02:30:33,280 --> 02:30:34,280
not their review rating?

2534
02:30:34,280 --> 02:30:35,280
That's a fair argument.

2535
02:30:35,280 --> 02:30:37,280
I mean, I guess it's...

2536
02:30:37,280 --> 02:30:39,280
The system, it's going to basically,

2537
02:30:39,280 --> 02:30:40,280
what it's going to come down to is,

2538
02:30:40,280 --> 02:30:42,280
yeah, there's going to be people that are going to do that,

2539
02:30:42,280 --> 02:30:44,280
and, you know, rally their friends,

2540
02:30:44,280 --> 02:30:46,280
but in the end it all equals out,

2541
02:30:46,280 --> 02:30:49,280
because there's a lot more people not involved with them

2542
02:30:49,280 --> 02:30:51,280
that, you know, aren't going to be rating and stuff.

2543
02:30:51,280 --> 02:30:54,280
So that it'll be just a slight fluctuation,

2544
02:30:54,280 --> 02:30:56,280
and that's really kind of,

2545
02:30:56,280 --> 02:30:58,280
you've got to account for that kind of error in there.

2546
02:30:58,280 --> 02:31:00,280
Well, I hope you're right,

2547
02:31:00,280 --> 02:31:02,280
and we can all hear you eating over there.

2548
02:31:02,280 --> 02:31:04,280
I just hit the mic with my plate.

2549
02:31:04,280 --> 02:31:07,280
Also, Kay Levster says,

2550
02:31:07,280 --> 02:31:09,280
I think it will sort itself out.

2551
02:31:09,280 --> 02:31:12,280
The Xbox Live community is far more liquid than Dig.

2552
02:31:12,280 --> 02:31:13,280
I don't know, though.

2553
02:31:13,280 --> 02:31:15,280
There's some real, like, come on.

2554
02:31:15,280 --> 02:31:16,280
You've played Halo Online.

2555
02:31:16,280 --> 02:31:17,280
I don't know if you have,

2556
02:31:17,280 --> 02:31:19,280
but a lot of you have played, like, Halo Online.

2557
02:31:19,280 --> 02:31:22,280
There are some people who play those games online.

2558
02:31:22,280 --> 02:31:24,280
I don't want to hear their opinions.

2559
02:31:24,280 --> 02:31:26,280
I don't want to hear what they have to say.

2560
02:31:26,280 --> 02:31:27,280
You know what I mean?

2561
02:31:27,280 --> 02:31:30,280
These people that get on there and say n-word, n-word, f-word, f-word.

2562
02:31:30,280 --> 02:31:32,280
You know who I'm talking about.

2563
02:31:32,280 --> 02:31:34,280
Like, is there a way I could just, like, block out their ratings?

2564
02:31:34,280 --> 02:31:37,280
If I block them on Xbox Live, will it block their ratings out too?

2565
02:31:37,280 --> 02:31:39,280
I do think it would be really smart,

2566
02:31:39,280 --> 02:31:42,280
and it would also, once again, go back to tying in.

2567
02:31:42,280 --> 02:31:45,280
Because you can do, like, with your Xbox Live arcade games,

2568
02:31:45,280 --> 02:31:49,280
you can see where you rank, like, in the leaderboards versus the world

2569
02:31:49,280 --> 02:31:51,280
versus, you know, your friends.

2570
02:31:51,280 --> 02:31:54,280
And I think their reviews should also be the same way.

2571
02:31:54,280 --> 02:31:55,280
If your friends have reviewed that,

2572
02:31:55,280 --> 02:31:57,280
you should be able to see their reviews,

2573
02:31:57,280 --> 02:31:59,280
or you can just see the community as a whole.

2574
02:31:59,280 --> 02:32:00,280
Ooh, like Netflix.

2575
02:32:00,280 --> 02:32:02,280
Netflix, perfect. Perfect model.

2576
02:32:02,280 --> 02:32:04,280
And Xbox has it in with Netflix anyway.

2577
02:32:04,280 --> 02:32:05,280
There you go.

2578
02:32:05,280 --> 02:32:06,280
There you go.

2579
02:32:06,280 --> 02:32:07,280
Steal from Netflix.

2580
02:32:07,280 --> 02:32:08,280
There's the answer.

2581
02:32:08,280 --> 02:32:10,280
Great.

2582
02:32:10,280 --> 02:32:11,280
All right.

2583
02:32:11,280 --> 02:32:14,280
Well, I want to move on to another story,

2584
02:32:14,280 --> 02:32:15,280
and it has to do with Microsoft.

2585
02:32:15,280 --> 02:32:16,280
A whole lot of Microsoft tonight.

2586
02:32:16,280 --> 02:32:20,280
But Project Natal, going back to that, talking about,

2587
02:32:20,280 --> 02:32:22,280
we were talking about it a little bit during Part A,

2588
02:32:22,280 --> 02:32:25,280
but it's made its mainstream television debut.

2589
02:32:25,280 --> 02:32:26,280
That's right.

2590
02:32:26,280 --> 02:32:29,280
It showed up on Late Night with Jimmy Fallon.

2591
02:32:29,280 --> 02:32:31,280
It showed up a little earlier this week.

2592
02:32:31,280 --> 02:32:34,280
Oop, I'm bringing up the actual Hulu thing here in studio,

2593
02:32:34,280 --> 02:32:35,280
although they're going to do a commercial here,

2594
02:32:35,280 --> 02:32:36,280
so I'm going to mute it for that,

2595
02:32:36,280 --> 02:32:38,280
because if the commercial people aren't going to pay us,

2596
02:32:38,280 --> 02:32:40,280
I'm not going to rebroadcast that.

2597
02:32:40,280 --> 02:32:45,280
But I do want to show a little bit about the whole Jimmy Fallon late night thing.

2598
02:32:45,280 --> 02:32:48,280
They actually showed Natal on it, and I don't know why,

2599
02:32:48,280 --> 02:32:50,280
but they all were wearing these red jumpsuits and things

2600
02:32:50,280 --> 02:32:51,280
when they were demoing it.

2601
02:32:51,280 --> 02:32:55,280
But certainly it was interesting, if nothing else,

2602
02:32:55,280 --> 02:33:01,280
to actually see this being played by somebody who wasn't a Microsoft spokesperson.

2603
02:33:01,280 --> 02:33:02,280
You know what I mean?

2604
02:33:02,280 --> 02:33:05,280
It was a real person at least checking this out.

2605
02:33:05,280 --> 02:33:09,280
All right, let's actually see if we can check this out just a little bit here.

2606
02:33:09,280 --> 02:33:11,280
It's a bunch of red shirts. Kill them.

2607
02:33:11,280 --> 02:33:14,280
I'm going to actually forward ahead a little bit here in the video

2608
02:33:14,280 --> 02:33:16,280
so we can actually see where they're playing.

2609
02:33:16,280 --> 02:33:17,280
My avatar walks with me.

2610
02:33:17,280 --> 02:33:20,280
How much room can you put this one in your dorm room?

2611
02:33:20,280 --> 02:33:21,280
Oh, totally.

2612
02:33:21,280 --> 02:33:23,280
We'll be able to fit it into all types of different living spaces

2613
02:33:23,280 --> 02:33:25,280
so anybody can get in and play it.

2614
02:33:25,280 --> 02:33:27,280
Now this is going to work with all Xbox 360s.

2615
02:33:27,280 --> 02:33:29,280
People already have any one that's bought in the future.

2616
02:33:29,280 --> 02:33:30,280
It all just works.

2617
02:33:30,280 --> 02:33:31,280
I want this now.

2618
02:33:31,280 --> 02:33:32,280
Excellent.

2619
02:33:32,280 --> 02:33:34,280
Well, I'm sure we can work out a deal for you.

2620
02:33:34,280 --> 02:33:35,280
Jimmy Fallon, you're not funny.

2621
02:33:35,280 --> 02:33:36,280
Still.

2622
02:33:36,280 --> 02:33:37,280
I'm going to do a little quick demo.

2623
02:33:37,280 --> 02:33:40,280
I'm going to forward a little ahead to where they're actually playing.

2624
02:33:40,280 --> 02:33:42,280
Come on.

2625
02:33:42,280 --> 02:33:44,280
You can see where the shadow is there.

2626
02:33:44,280 --> 02:33:46,280
It's like a 3D little breakout game.

2627
02:33:46,280 --> 02:33:48,280
This is one of the games they were showing actually

2628
02:33:48,280 --> 02:33:50,280
at E3 as one of the demos.

2629
02:33:50,280 --> 02:33:51,280
It's kind of cool.

2630
02:33:51,280 --> 02:33:53,280
Let me turn this down a little bit.

2631
02:33:53,280 --> 02:33:56,280
Yeah, it looks like fun to flail around like a fool for a little while,

2632
02:33:56,280 --> 02:33:58,280
but I don't know for how long.

2633
02:33:58,280 --> 02:34:00,280
Again, I don't think there's an actual game here,

2634
02:34:00,280 --> 02:34:03,280
but if this is a minigame in a much larger game,

2635
02:34:03,280 --> 02:34:04,280
I think this could be cool.

2636
02:34:04,280 --> 02:34:07,280
You're doing it like volleyball.

2637
02:34:07,280 --> 02:34:10,280
Yeah, I mean, the game, you know,

2638
02:34:10,280 --> 02:34:12,280
it looks like it might be fun for a little while.

2639
02:34:12,280 --> 02:34:14,280
I don't know about the longevity of it,

2640
02:34:14,280 --> 02:34:15,280
but a lot of weak games.

2641
02:34:15,280 --> 02:34:16,280
I think this is a demo.

2642
02:34:16,280 --> 02:34:17,280
This is a demo, though.

2643
02:34:17,280 --> 02:34:19,280
Yeah, but, okay, yeah.

2644
02:34:19,280 --> 02:34:20,280
To be fair, it's a tech demo.

2645
02:34:20,280 --> 02:34:21,280
No, like, games.

2646
02:34:21,280 --> 02:34:22,280
So was Wii Sports and Wii Play.

2647
02:34:22,280 --> 02:34:25,280
So a lot of the things you saw in Wii Play were tech demos, too.

2648
02:34:25,280 --> 02:34:28,280
I think this will come out if nothing else is an Xbox Live arcade game.

2649
02:34:28,280 --> 02:34:29,280
You'll see this.

2650
02:34:29,280 --> 02:34:31,280
They'll make a game out of this somehow.

2651
02:34:31,280 --> 02:34:32,280
But...

2652
02:34:32,280 --> 02:34:34,280
I think that there...

2653
02:34:34,280 --> 02:34:38,280
I honestly, though, see a whole lot of potential for this technology, though.

2654
02:34:38,280 --> 02:34:40,280
There really is.

2655
02:34:40,280 --> 02:34:45,280
Honestly, I'm not ready to pass judgment on it yet.

2656
02:34:45,280 --> 02:34:46,280
Really, I'm not.

2657
02:34:46,280 --> 02:34:48,280
sj100map makes a correction to something I was saying.

2658
02:34:48,280 --> 02:34:51,280
Correction, Rob, that was the only demo they did on stage, I believe.

2659
02:34:51,280 --> 02:34:52,280
That's a good point.

2660
02:34:52,280 --> 02:34:54,280
When they did that whole Milo thing, that was a pre-taped video.

2661
02:34:54,280 --> 02:34:56,280
But they did a demo on stage, though.

2662
02:34:56,280 --> 02:35:00,280
They did that exact same game on stage with Project Natal at the press conference.

2663
02:35:00,280 --> 02:35:01,280
Got it.

2664
02:35:01,280 --> 02:35:04,280
So this is like their touring game that they have to show at the stuff.

2665
02:35:04,280 --> 02:35:06,280
But still, the nice thing about it was,

2666
02:35:06,280 --> 02:35:09,280
it was, you know, say what you want to about Jimmy Fallon

2667
02:35:09,280 --> 02:35:11,280
and his humor or lack thereof.

2668
02:35:11,280 --> 02:35:14,280
He's not somebody in the game industry.

2669
02:35:14,280 --> 02:35:17,280
He's like a quote-unquote real person now demoing this.

2670
02:35:17,280 --> 02:35:19,280
So you know it wasn't rigged.

2671
02:35:19,280 --> 02:35:20,280
Does that make sense?

2672
02:35:20,280 --> 02:35:21,280
Yes.

2673
02:35:21,280 --> 02:35:24,280
You know, everything that happened was, you know, like a real thing.

2674
02:35:24,280 --> 02:35:29,280
So now I feel like this is really the first time we're really getting to see this in action.

2675
02:35:29,280 --> 02:35:31,280
Because Natal was hidden on the show floor.

2676
02:35:31,280 --> 02:35:34,280
And they weren't letting regular people play it.

2677
02:35:34,280 --> 02:35:36,280
Like, this was a huge step in actually seeing this.

2678
02:35:36,280 --> 02:35:38,280
By the way, sorry to get off track here,

2679
02:35:38,280 --> 02:35:42,280
but what is up with Jimmy Fallon, like, kind of like tapping into the game industry lately?

2680
02:35:42,280 --> 02:35:47,280
Well, that's what he says. His thing was that he wants to treat game releases like movie releases.

2681
02:35:47,280 --> 02:35:50,280
Like, he's a big gamer, I guess.

2682
02:35:50,280 --> 02:35:54,280
And apparently he's going to start doing more content like this.

2683
02:35:54,280 --> 02:35:56,280
Is that maybe because of his audience?

2684
02:35:56,280 --> 02:35:59,280
Because, you know, who stays up to watch Late Night College Kids?

2685
02:35:59,280 --> 02:36:02,280
Maybe he's trying to tap a new audience because, you know,

2686
02:36:02,280 --> 02:36:05,280
a lot of the audience that was fans of Conan moved to Conan.

2687
02:36:05,280 --> 02:36:09,280
And also maybe he realizes he's not that funny.

2688
02:36:09,280 --> 02:36:11,280
So, you know, stick with what you know.

2689
02:36:11,280 --> 02:36:16,280
Well, to be fair, you know what, to be fair, Conan had a real rough first six months.

2690
02:36:16,280 --> 02:36:18,280
You know, a lot of people wrote him off when the show first started.

2691
02:36:18,280 --> 02:36:20,280
He didn't find his niche for a year.

2692
02:36:20,280 --> 02:36:22,280
So I'm willing to give Jimmy Fallon a year. Whatever.

2693
02:36:22,280 --> 02:36:27,280
But all that aside, you know, he has been, you know, pretty decent, I guess, about coverage.

2694
02:36:27,280 --> 02:36:34,280
I feel like I'm getting more gaming coverage watching Jimmy Fallon than I am most times I'm watching G4, E3 Accepted.

2695
02:36:34,280 --> 02:36:35,280
You know what I mean?

2696
02:36:35,280 --> 02:36:36,280
Yeah.

2697
02:36:36,280 --> 02:36:40,280
They had Jason Sudeikis or whatever his name is kind of around at E3.

2698
02:36:40,280 --> 02:36:46,280
That's kind of funny. I like the little video they did for that.

2699
02:36:46,280 --> 02:36:49,280
Yeah, Kay Levster in chat makes a funny comment.

2700
02:36:49,280 --> 02:36:53,280
He wants to get his games for free, thus now he's scared.

2701
02:36:53,280 --> 02:36:56,280
Tigerclaw says Jimmy Fallon is a bit of a tech geek.

2702
02:36:56,280 --> 02:36:59,280
He had the guys from Dignation on the show before.

2703
02:36:59,280 --> 02:37:02,280
He's living up to his promising of promoting video games.

2704
02:37:02,280 --> 02:37:07,280
Well, I'm glad somebody is.

2705
02:37:07,280 --> 02:37:15,280
Alright, well, regardless, it was kind of nice to see Natal actually kind of making a show on a big, you know, well, I don't know if you want to say big,

2706
02:37:15,280 --> 02:37:24,280
but a fair show that has at least a million people watching it and getting, you know, a live real person who doesn't work for the company playing it.

2707
02:37:24,280 --> 02:37:25,280
Hmm.

2708
02:37:25,280 --> 02:37:29,280
No, it kind of changed topics a little bit.

2709
02:37:29,280 --> 02:37:36,280
Apparently, Alexey Pajitnov, the creator of Tetris.

2710
02:37:36,280 --> 02:37:42,280
Of course, you know, Tetris just had its 25th anniversary not too long ago.

2711
02:37:42,280 --> 02:37:52,280
Apparently, he's saying that he wants, well, it's, you know, so huge right now with, you know, with like 125 million copies sold.

2712
02:37:52,280 --> 02:37:58,280
And, you know, probably one of the, I think one of the biggest, most recognized games out there.

2713
02:37:58,280 --> 02:38:03,280
He's saying they could see probably an evolution of Tetris becoming a sport.

2714
02:38:03,280 --> 02:38:09,280
Of course, the future is that a country that has 48 million people living in it,

2715
02:38:09,280 --> 02:38:14,280
and the biggest casual gaming site in the country has 24 million registered users.

2716
02:38:14,280 --> 02:38:15,280
That country is Korea.

2717
02:38:15,280 --> 02:38:18,280
That's what's going to happen in the rest of the world.

2718
02:38:18,280 --> 02:38:25,280
So kind of like, you know, everybody competing in this first virtual sport.

2719
02:38:25,280 --> 02:38:32,280
Sports like baseball and football were created at a time when their future was a lifetime of physical activities and physical fitness.

2720
02:38:32,280 --> 02:38:34,280
But now that's not as important.

2721
02:38:34,280 --> 02:38:37,280
It's more about mental fitness today.

2722
02:38:37,280 --> 02:38:40,280
And Tetris is a virtual sport that exercises the mind.

2723
02:38:40,280 --> 02:38:45,280
That's the definition of a virtual sport.

2724
02:38:45,280 --> 02:38:50,280
So how exactly would, I guess I'm not getting it, how exactly, where would the sport be in this?

2725
02:38:50,280 --> 02:38:51,280
Competing one-on-one.

2726
02:38:51,280 --> 02:38:56,280
It's just, you know, a bunch of people in a Tetris tournament.

2727
02:38:56,280 --> 02:38:58,280
The end.

2728
02:38:58,280 --> 02:38:59,280
Hmm.

2729
02:38:59,280 --> 02:39:05,280
Interesting, though, that it seems like we always have this video games as a sport discussion comes up once in a while.

2730
02:39:05,280 --> 02:39:06,280
Remember when they wanted to make DDR a sport?

2731
02:39:06,280 --> 02:39:08,280
Or they did in a couple of countries.

2732
02:39:08,280 --> 02:39:09,280
I know, but here's the thing.

2733
02:39:09,280 --> 02:39:14,280
I think we're looking at it, when we say sports, we think physical sports.

2734
02:39:14,280 --> 02:39:17,280
And he's trying to say that there's other sports out there, like chess.

2735
02:39:17,280 --> 02:39:19,280
Chess is not a physical sport.

2736
02:39:19,280 --> 02:39:21,280
I mean, you play it physically, but it's more mental.

2737
02:39:21,280 --> 02:39:23,280
Is chess at the Olympics?

2738
02:39:23,280 --> 02:39:25,280
I don't think so.

2739
02:39:25,280 --> 02:39:26,280
I don't know.

2740
02:39:26,280 --> 02:39:27,280
That's a very good question.

2741
02:39:27,280 --> 02:39:29,280
I wonder if one of our chatters knows.

2742
02:39:29,280 --> 02:39:31,280
Is chess an Olympic sport?

2743
02:39:31,280 --> 02:39:32,280
I don't think it is.

2744
02:39:32,280 --> 02:39:33,280
Hmm.

2745
02:39:33,280 --> 02:39:34,280
But like, you know, stuff like that.

2746
02:39:34,280 --> 02:39:41,280
You know, nowadays, you know, with a lot of gamers out there now, they have, you know, the, you know, championship gaming stuff that they do,

2747
02:39:41,280 --> 02:39:48,280
which making, you know, people into actual teams and stuff like that and promoting them like a football team and stuff.

2748
02:39:48,280 --> 02:39:51,280
That's cool and all, but I don't know.

2749
02:39:51,280 --> 02:39:53,280
That's not really the model I see.

2750
02:39:53,280 --> 02:39:55,280
Three no's in chat, by the way.

2751
02:39:55,280 --> 02:39:57,280
Chess is not an Olympic sport.

2752
02:39:57,280 --> 02:40:04,280
And, in fact, I even Googled it, and there was an article in Time Magazine, August 5th of 2008, chess and bridge enthusiasts,

2753
02:40:04,280 --> 02:40:08,280
they are lobbying the International Olympic Committee to allow their games.

2754
02:40:08,280 --> 02:40:09,280
I don't think that they should be.

2755
02:40:09,280 --> 02:40:13,280
I mean, the Olympics is a physical sports competition.

2756
02:40:13,280 --> 02:40:15,280
It shouldn't be.

2757
02:40:15,280 --> 02:40:19,280
You know, DDR shouldn't be really a sport.

2758
02:40:19,280 --> 02:40:22,280
I mean, you play it physically, but it's not...

2759
02:40:22,280 --> 02:40:31,280
Oh, DDR is hard to compete in anyways. It's basically about accuracy and, you know, as far as a way to actually grade it and freestyle and stuff.

2760
02:40:31,280 --> 02:40:34,280
It's kind of stupid because that's just interpretive dance, so I don't know.

2761
02:40:34,280 --> 02:40:36,280
Well, but they have interpretive dance in the Olympics.

2762
02:40:36,280 --> 02:40:41,280
Yeah, and why do you need DDR? I would think it'd be retarded, and it would only give Konami more reasons.

2763
02:40:41,280 --> 02:40:47,280
DDR is more of a... Oh, God, not to get down on this, but in its heyday, DDR would have been better suited for something like the X Games,

2764
02:40:47,280 --> 02:40:51,280
or something, you know, like an ESPN2 Olympics, you know what I mean?

2765
02:40:51,280 --> 02:40:53,280
ESPN8, the Ocho.

2766
02:40:53,280 --> 02:40:55,280
Exactly, the Ocho Olympics.

2767
02:40:55,280 --> 02:40:59,280
So why shouldn't Tetris be on... Did you ever see the movie Dodgeball?

2768
02:40:59,280 --> 02:41:00,280
No.

2769
02:41:00,280 --> 02:41:02,280
Because Jamie's giving us this look of, like, what the hell are you guys saying?

2770
02:41:02,280 --> 02:41:03,280
That's the joke.

2771
02:41:03,280 --> 02:41:05,280
I want to know what planet you're from.

2772
02:41:05,280 --> 02:41:07,280
Alright, anyway.

2773
02:41:07,280 --> 02:41:11,280
What else? Ah, now I lost my train of thought. Choo-choo, derailed.

2774
02:41:13,280 --> 02:41:17,280
Is this the type of thing that he thinks should be televised, or what?

2775
02:41:17,280 --> 02:41:18,280
I guess we don't know, but...

2776
02:41:18,280 --> 02:41:23,280
I don't know. I mean, this is just him making a comment, and bloggers picking up on it, like, going,

2777
02:41:23,280 --> 02:41:25,280
Oh my God, he thinks it should be a sport!

2778
02:41:25,280 --> 02:41:33,280
Well, if it, let's say it was the type of sport that you would see on the Ocho, or, you know, in all reality, ESPN2 or something like that, would you watch it?

2779
02:41:33,280 --> 02:41:34,280
Nope.

2780
02:41:34,280 --> 02:41:47,280
I'm curious, chatters, if Tetris was a sport, and they broadcast the big, uh, the big showdowns live on ESPN or ESPN2 or ABC Wild World of Sports, would you watch it?

2781
02:41:47,280 --> 02:41:50,280
I guess this all goes into competitive gaming.

2782
02:41:50,280 --> 02:41:51,280
Human Tetris.

2783
02:41:51,280 --> 02:41:57,280
They, well, they did make a show out of that, aren't they? Isn't that going to be a show on Fox or something?

2784
02:41:57,280 --> 02:41:59,280
It is already. Yeah, it's The Wall.

2785
02:41:59,280 --> 02:42:04,280
It was like, they did it as a gag on Ellen, like, five minutes a week or something.

2786
02:42:04,280 --> 02:42:10,280
Well, it was in Japan. It's an actual show in Japan, and they do it for fun there, but, you know, we have to do it for prizes.

2787
02:42:10,280 --> 02:42:13,280
No such thing as fun and game shows.

2788
02:42:13,280 --> 02:42:21,280
Osfer in chat says, I go to Ohio tournaments often, and I can say that DDR is definitely competitive enough to be an Olympic sport.

2789
02:42:21,280 --> 02:42:23,280
Chat.orangelandradio.com.

2790
02:42:23,280 --> 02:42:27,280
Kay Levster says, watching Tetris is like watching golf, so, no.

2791
02:42:27,280 --> 02:42:29,280
There's a whole channel dedicated to golf, though, mind you.

2792
02:42:29,280 --> 02:42:30,280
Exactly.

2793
02:42:30,280 --> 02:42:31,280
A whole channel.

2794
02:42:31,280 --> 02:42:39,280
It would, it just wouldn't be something that, I mean, it's hard to make it interesting, I guess.

2795
02:42:39,280 --> 02:42:43,280
If you're going to say no to that, though, what about competitive gaming on TV?

2796
02:42:43,280 --> 02:42:45,280
Should we just not have competitive gaming on TV, then?

2797
02:42:45,280 --> 02:42:52,280
Like the, you know, Counter-Strike tournaments and, you know, whatever the first person shooter hit of the week happens to be that they're playing online?

2798
02:42:52,280 --> 02:42:54,280
Should they not be televised, either?

2799
02:42:54,280 --> 02:43:00,280
No, I don't think it's an issue of them being televised at all. It's just a way of how we're able to capture it and film it.

2800
02:43:00,280 --> 02:43:06,280
Sports, that's easy to televise because you can, you know, usually all the gameplay and stuff is going on in one area.

2801
02:43:06,280 --> 02:43:09,280
You can, you know, zoom back to catch the whole field and stuff like that.

2802
02:43:09,280 --> 02:43:12,280
Like, doing Counter-Strike, you can't really film that.

2803
02:43:12,280 --> 02:43:17,280
There's no way that you can see everything that's going on all at once because of the nature of the game it is.

2804
02:43:17,280 --> 02:43:20,280
You have to kind of focus on the different players and stuff.

2805
02:43:20,280 --> 02:43:30,280
I guess, I don't know, it's, you know, NASCAR, you can kind of do that kind of stuff where you can film the whole pack of cars and stuff, but they do like the in-car camps and that kind of thing.

2806
02:43:30,280 --> 02:43:39,280
But, it's just hard to film it and make it interesting in the same way as like a football game or a baseball game or something like that.

2807
02:43:39,280 --> 02:43:46,280
Where they've been doing it for years and they've figured out, you know, they have commentators and know what they're talking about and stuff like that.

2808
02:43:46,280 --> 02:43:55,280
It's like, you know, if you started filming Counter-Strike or something like that and you started talking about it, you know, and you had, you know, commentators going,

2809
02:43:55,280 --> 02:43:59,240
this person so I don't know who these people are I'm aware that counter-strike

2810
02:43:59,240 --> 02:44:03,600
exists and what it basically is but I don't know who any of these players are

2811
02:44:03,600 --> 02:44:08,480
and this wouldn't really be interesting to me I don't know it's it's just it's

2812
02:44:08,480 --> 02:44:15,320
really tough to broadcast and you're not going to get the same responses like the

2813
02:44:15,320 --> 02:44:21,160
NFL or something the Rob D in chat makes comment that see this is the problem

2814
02:44:21,160 --> 02:44:24,640
competitive gaming how many different things can happen in football you might

2815
02:44:24,640 --> 02:44:28,320
see something that you've never seen before every week in DDR the

2816
02:44:28,320 --> 02:44:31,060
participants aren't even interacting it's a matter of seeing who scores the

2817
02:44:31,060 --> 02:44:34,360
most I think it would take a lot more animations and reactions to make it more

2818
02:44:34,360 --> 02:44:37,860
it is hard to like with a fighting game or something like that I think the

2819
02:44:37,860 --> 02:44:42,020
fighting game would be the easiest thing to film because it's all one screen you

2820
02:44:42,020 --> 02:44:46,880
can see all the action all at once you know but the problem is it's moving so

2821
02:44:46,880 --> 02:44:52,320
fast it's hard to commentate on that you can't really commentate where there's

2822
02:44:52,320 --> 02:44:56,800
baseball there's a punch in there oh my gosh I do get no my gosh it is a super

2823
02:44:56,800 --> 02:45:01,400
combo attack on the kind of you know it was baseball and football there's a lot

2824
02:45:01,400 --> 02:45:05,320
of you know different you know pauses in the game where you can catch up the

2825
02:45:05,320 --> 02:45:09,120
speeds the instant replays that kind of stuff they've figured out of filling you

2826
02:45:09,120 --> 02:45:15,400
know the gaps but it's just it's too difficult to film this like it like a

2827
02:45:15,400 --> 02:45:19,280
sport I think a little bit of back and forth going on ospher says it's still

2828
02:45:19,280 --> 02:45:23,240
competing whoever can get the highest score on max unlimited isn't really that

2829
02:45:23,240 --> 02:45:29,520
different than who can get the best time on a 100 meter dash hmm also a lot of

2830
02:45:29,520 --> 02:45:33,160
talk about that old show arena on g4 a lot of fans of that show in our chat

2831
02:45:33,160 --> 02:45:36,600
room right now I wasn't that big on arena you know why because it was so

2832
02:45:36,600 --> 02:45:40,120
heavily edited you were only really seeing the highlights of every match and

2833
02:45:40,120 --> 02:45:42,760
I don't know like I felt like I didn't learn enough about the game and the

2834
02:45:42,760 --> 02:45:47,240
actual strategy and how to get better from just seeing and it was so fast the

2835
02:45:47,240 --> 02:45:50,240
way they went back and forth from all the different piece I didn't never felt

2836
02:45:50,240 --> 02:45:54,040
like I really understood what was going on watching that show maybe it's just

2837
02:45:54,040 --> 02:45:56,920
because I'm not into first-person shooters as much as I am other games but

2838
02:45:56,920 --> 02:46:00,760
that was my problem see they could do like something I'm I don't even know if

2839
02:46:00,760 --> 02:46:04,360
a game exists out there like that would like Call of Duty 4 actually this be

2840
02:46:04,360 --> 02:46:08,560
more like operation of flashpoint 2 I think because it's more open-world but

2841
02:46:08,560 --> 02:46:11,320
like you could do something where you have two different teams you can show

2842
02:46:11,320 --> 02:46:15,920
them strategizing you you know about the game beforehand you know planning out

2843
02:46:15,920 --> 02:46:18,640
stuff they could talk about the different possibilities how they may be

2844
02:46:18,640 --> 02:46:22,320
able to like okay your team you know the red team right here can you know go down

2845
02:46:22,320 --> 02:46:25,800
flank under this you know through this valley or something like that you know

2846
02:46:25,800 --> 02:46:29,120
but then they have to watch out so there's a lot of commentary in like

2847
02:46:29,120 --> 02:46:34,760
visual aids that they could do there but it's just it's really tough once again

2848
02:46:34,760 --> 02:46:39,440
and I am pretty much stresses almost every sentence now it's really tough to

2849
02:46:39,440 --> 02:46:45,320
film this stuff to make it interesting you just I don't know it's unless it's

2850
02:46:45,320 --> 02:46:49,320
like you know a NASCAR game or like Project Gotham would kind of work

2851
02:46:49,320 --> 02:46:53,040
because they had the spectator mode where you can actually watch the cars

2852
02:46:53,040 --> 02:46:57,680
and stuff racing around almost like as you were you know watching a you know

2853
02:46:57,680 --> 02:47:01,920
television production of you know race so you could do something similar like

2854
02:47:01,920 --> 02:47:05,720
that and that might work as far as commentary and stuff goes you know maybe

2855
02:47:05,720 --> 02:47:12,400
like a Ridge Racer would be kind of interesting but you know it really it's

2856
02:47:12,400 --> 02:47:17,960
only specific types of games and I don't know first-person shooters are really

2857
02:47:17,960 --> 02:47:22,320
going to work because it's so massive and there's so much stuff going on SSJ

2858
02:47:22,320 --> 02:47:25,040
100 Matt says this and we're going to move on try to get towards the end of

2859
02:47:25,040 --> 02:47:29,200
the show here the fact is statistics and ratings show people don't really care

2860
02:47:29,200 --> 02:47:33,600
for watching people playing video games yet Starcraft televised competitions

2861
02:47:33,600 --> 02:47:39,760
works in Korea Tiger Claw in chat says the problem was showing live gameplay of

2862
02:47:39,760 --> 02:47:43,520
attorney is the action can get very repetitive and the average viewer will

2863
02:47:43,520 --> 02:47:47,020
get bored by it Wallace gamers are used to seeing the repetitiveness of the

2864
02:47:47,020 --> 02:47:50,000
games all right we're going to leave it there if you have further comments you

2865
02:47:50,000 --> 02:47:53,480
can always send us an email mailbag orange lounge radio.com but we want to

2866
02:47:53,480 --> 02:47:57,840
get to the F use of the week and of course something has to inspire the F use

2867
02:47:57,840 --> 02:48:02,880
of the week what better than a stupid gamer doing something stupid it was a

2868
02:48:02,880 --> 02:48:08,720
brotherly argument over video games it was an 11 year old Mississippi kid

2869
02:48:08,720 --> 02:48:13,800
shooting a nine-year-old brother in the chest with a shotgun according to

2870
02:48:13,800 --> 02:48:17,640
Sheriff Kenny Dickerson from Mark Marshall County the younger brother

2871
02:48:17,640 --> 02:48:23,080
allegedly got mad because he beat got beat at some video games and got the gun

2872
02:48:23,080 --> 02:48:26,920
the older brother said the weapon automatically went off when the two

2873
02:48:26,920 --> 02:48:35,880
fought over it so yeah by the way they're saying that is unlikely the kid

2874
02:48:35,880 --> 02:48:40,480
will be charged because he is under 13 years old and the entire incident

2875
02:48:40,480 --> 02:48:46,680
appeared to be an accident anyway that's the part that disturbs me a lot like a

2876
02:48:46,680 --> 02:48:55,840
lot like I realize he's a child but oh my god like not a mention of the parents

2877
02:48:55,840 --> 02:48:59,600
and like what parent keeps a shotgun accessible to their 11 year old and

2878
02:48:59,600 --> 02:49:05,520
obviously not you know a good one oh this just gives gamers everywhere a bad

2879
02:49:05,520 --> 02:49:09,000
name to I hate it when stories like this are picked up by video game blogs too

2880
02:49:09,000 --> 02:49:11,800
because it's just kind of like this really didn't have anything to do with

2881
02:49:11,800 --> 02:49:15,440
video games yeah they fought over video games but you'll maybe not so much the

2882
02:49:15,440 --> 02:49:18,120
gamer blogs I hate it when the mainstream media picks up these stories

2883
02:49:18,120 --> 02:49:21,720
because it makes gamers look violent when this really has nothing to do with

2884
02:49:21,720 --> 02:49:27,080
the video games this has everything to do with just blatant stupidity and bad

2885
02:49:27,080 --> 02:49:35,000
bad bad terrible pain or parenting hmm so with that the F use of the week

2886
02:49:35,000 --> 02:49:53,160
Oh dark soccer would you care to start us off with a rant of your own tonight

2887
02:49:53,160 --> 02:50:02,960
if you do not let shit go Loki f you to moving especially my cat which it's not

2888
02:50:02,960 --> 02:50:06,880
really her fault but she can't sleep right now because she's worried and

2889
02:50:06,880 --> 02:50:11,400
doesn't know what's going on cats having trouble adjusting to places so she kept

2890
02:50:11,400 --> 02:50:16,000
this up all night Oh and F you to myself for accidentally breaking the water line

2891
02:50:16,000 --> 02:50:22,720
going to my fridge causing it to drip but in defense I think it's broken

2892
02:50:22,720 --> 02:50:28,320
before I messed with it anyway so but cost me $175 have a plumber come out

2893
02:50:28,320 --> 02:50:34,800
this morning fix it after you to people that you thought were great friends that

2894
02:50:34,800 --> 02:50:39,600
seemed to disappear off the face of the planet altogether you know it just kind

2895
02:50:39,600 --> 02:50:42,920
of sucks like to be felt like sometimes you're being dropped like a hot potato

2896
02:50:42,920 --> 02:50:49,800
in I don't know for whatever reason so it's kind of stinks you know friends

2897
02:50:49,800 --> 02:50:52,840
supposed to stick by each other through thick and thin sometimes I get the

2898
02:50:52,840 --> 02:50:57,960
feeling that's not happening so F you to those general feelings of angst I hope

2899
02:50:57,960 --> 02:51:06,680
I'm just I hope it's all in my head all right let's move on towards the end of

2900
02:51:06,680 --> 02:51:10,400
the program here I think we're going to get into the rapid-fire news tonight so

2901
02:51:10,400 --> 02:51:13,520
I'm just kind of going over some of the stories we didn't talk about more in

2902
02:51:13,520 --> 02:51:16,960
depth but things you might want to know about anyway dark soccer you want to

2903
02:51:16,960 --> 02:51:21,040
start off with your share of rapid-fire news tonight well we've just had a green

2904
02:51:21,040 --> 02:51:26,660
day sign up for rock band so we'll have 21 guns know your enemy East Jesus

nowhere from 21st century breakdown which was not really a good album then

2906
02:51:31,800 --> 02:51:39,040
we have a salmon max 1 coming to Xbox live for 1600 Microsoft points good more

2907
02:51:39,040 --> 02:51:44,780
people will try it now yep also world of warcraft is slashing mount requirements

2908
02:51:44,780 --> 02:51:50,360
so that you can get them at level 20 and epic mounts will be available at 40

2909
02:51:50,360 --> 02:51:57,640
flying mounts at 60 whoopty shit and then the new Zelda game which there's

2910
02:51:57,640 --> 02:52:00,680
not a whole bunch out on though they're saying that it should include motion

2911
02:52:00,680 --> 02:52:06,680
plus or actually sorry that it it that it may require you to have the motion

2912
02:52:06,680 --> 02:52:12,280
plus Marissa con gusto and Chad is actually commenting on the green day

2913
02:52:12,280 --> 02:52:16,760
story Green Bay day rock band most of their songs are only three chords well

2914
02:52:16,760 --> 02:52:19,400
you know that would work though because the easy mode you only have three

2915
02:52:19,400 --> 02:52:24,000
buttons right so I guess I could just kind of line it up there yeah Loki

2916
02:52:24,000 --> 02:52:29,920

02:54:19,760 --> 02:54:24,360
all the information that was behind it they will be running the game I guess

2937
02:54:24,360 --> 02:54:27,480
for a little longer so if you are in the middle of the game you can actually

2938
02:54:27,480 --> 02:54:31,160
finish it but if you don't care to wait for that I think the PlayStation blog

2939
02:54:31,160 --> 02:54:37,360
has all the information as far as what's going on there so check it out if you

2940
02:54:37,360 --> 02:54:38,360
want to spoil it

2941
02:54:38,360 --> 02:54:46,120
alright well before we wrap up the show we are going to open up the sky plane

2942
02:54:46,120 --> 02:54:49,760
take your calls but first we didn't get to the classic game of the week in part

2943
02:54:49,760 --> 02:54:53,680
a we got to get that taken care of tonight it just wouldn't be a week here

2944
02:54:53,680 --> 02:54:57,120
at orange long radio without the classic game of the week so every week dark

2945
02:54:57,120 --> 02:55:00,320
soccer likes to dig through the great archive of gaming and pull out a game

2946
02:55:00,320 --> 02:55:04,120
that you people ought to be playing it's the classic game of the week and here it

2947
02:55:04,120 --> 02:55:05,120
is

2948
02:55:05,120 --> 02:55:14,080
what should the kids be playing this week Donkey Kong jr. seriously it is

2949
02:55:14,080 --> 02:55:18,480
seriously classic game it's one where Donkey Kong's little kid wearing a

2950
02:55:18,480 --> 02:55:23,920
diaper has to go rescue Donkey Kong from Mario who has captured him and

2951
02:55:23,920 --> 02:55:28,840
basically you just climb on ropes and drop fruit on these mechanized little

2952
02:55:28,840 --> 02:55:34,480
big mouth trap thingy these and then you have you know an electrical stage in

2953
02:55:34,480 --> 02:55:45,400
different areas it's actually supposed to be the the guy Steve Wiebe had the

2954
02:55:45,400 --> 02:55:50,320
highest score on this one actually and he did pass Billy Mitchell on this so

2955
02:55:50,320 --> 02:55:55,400
the untold story yeah I don't know that Billy Mitchell has surpassed it actually

2956
02:55:55,400 --> 02:56:01,440
since then his score was one million thirty three thousand points and Steve

2957
02:56:01,440 --> 02:56:06,040
Wiebe got one million one thousand thirty nine eight hundred points I have

2958
02:56:06,040 --> 02:56:08,960
this on several systems like the NES there's actually a game and watch

2959
02:56:08,960 --> 02:56:14,640
version the NES version was the launch title in Japan we have got it on a

2960
02:56:14,640 --> 02:56:18,920
virtual console there was an e-reader card it was an Animal Crossing so yeah

2961
02:56:18,920 --> 02:56:24,960
it's a pretty pretty classic this is one of the few Nintendo games I actually had

2962
02:56:24,960 --> 02:56:28,440
there was a combo pack that came out on the NES back in the day that was like

2963
02:56:28,440 --> 02:56:31,720
both Donkey Kong junior games and I had that actually I was one of the first

2964
02:56:31,720 --> 02:56:38,760
Antonio games I had so that's cool I played this on the Coleco yeah it's old

2965
02:56:38,760 --> 02:56:41,640
school you know what I actually kind of like this game better a little bit than

2966
02:56:41,640 --> 02:56:44,200
Donkey Kong I don't know why I guess I just like the whole concept of the vine

2967
02:56:44,200 --> 02:56:48,600
climbing and that you kind of go faster if you're willing to go across to be a

2968
02:56:48,600 --> 02:56:54,000
really fast when you slide down it's interesting all right if nothing else to

2969
02:56:54,000 --> 02:56:57,280
say on this game from Dark Soccer then that's gonna do it for your classic game

2970
02:56:57,280 --> 02:57:02,400
of the week Donkey Kong jr. on just about every freaking system ever made

2971
02:57:02,400 --> 02:57:07,760

2983
02:57:56,760 --> 02:58:01,240
and got to the groove of things it was fun and I really enjoyed myself this

2984
02:58:01,240 --> 02:58:04,240
year I have to be honest I've kind of been off Twitter all weekend I've been

2985

2987
02:58:12,640 --> 02:58:17,120
kind of been off Twitter but I can't understandable I know what you mean you

2988
02:58:17,120 --> 02:58:20,800
know sometimes you're just kind of not in the mood but then you get there and

2989
02:58:20,800 --> 02:58:23,720
it somehow all comes together like haven't you ever done that like there's

2990
02:58:23,720 --> 02:58:27,280
been like a party and you don't really want to go but maybe there's like either

2991
02:58:27,280 --> 02:58:31,200
a significant other or it's an important friend having the party or something you

2992
02:58:31,200 --> 02:58:34,240
know yeah and you're just not feeling it but you're like alright I'm gonna go

2993
02:58:34,240 --> 02:58:37,840
because I have to and maybe I'll stay for an hour then find an excuse to leave

2994
02:58:37,840 --> 02:58:41,360
like I have severe diarrhea or something right but then you get there and you're

2995
02:58:41,360 --> 02:58:44,400
like oh I'm actually having a good time it just kind of seems to all come

2996
02:58:44,400 --> 02:58:50,880
together like that yep that's how it was yeah so all right well what about you

2997
02:58:50,880 --> 02:58:53,720
know we're a gaming show so I always have to ask you how is the gaming

2998
02:58:53,720 --> 02:58:59,080
representation at the con was it was there good stuff there yeah um first up

2999
02:58:59,080 --> 02:59:04,600

3000
02:59:04,600 --> 02:59:11,840
is about 60 feet walk like about 60 feet wide pretty much mm-hmm it was a dark

3001
02:59:11,840 --> 02:59:16,160
room and I walked in everybody was singing living on a prayer was it is

3002
02:59:16,160 --> 02:59:19,400
this rock band room something where like people just randomly walk in and watch

3003
02:59:19,400 --> 02:59:23,600
people play rock band I mean is that yeah I mean you would wait your turn to

3004
02:59:23,600 --> 02:59:26,320
play but at the same time there was chair so we could sit down and watch

3005
02:59:26,320 --> 02:59:33,040

3006
02:59:33,040 --> 02:59:38,840
like an anime idol something like that and also there was also a beta test for

3007
02:59:38,840 --> 02:59:45,720

3010
02:59:58,680 --> 03:00:02,800

3013
03:00:10,840 --> 03:00:15,440
thing though I wasn't the one that made the joke cuz I walked in I saw the sign

3014
03:00:15,440 --> 03:00:20,280
I've run over to the other side the game room cuz I know when a guy is over I'm

3015
03:00:20,280 --> 03:00:25,400
like what's up with DJ here it was like no it's 2dx dudes 2dx I'm like haha

3019
03:00:37,000 --> 03:00:40,640
so much for your call and have fun now on the anime circuit come in got it all

3020
03:00:40,640 --> 03:00:46,280
right later let's see I'm looking at so because some of the chat rooms talking

3021
03:00:46,280 --> 03:00:49,800
about anime next a little bit here legend Zaku says I mean X was pretty

3022
03:00:49,800 --> 03:00:52,880
damn lackluster compared to previous years although the venue kicked ass this

3023
03:00:52,880 --> 03:00:58,100
year Oscar says I can't wait until mid-july when I go to Otacon and Rob

3024
03:00:58,100 --> 03:01:01,600
Diaz pimping his panel called games that push your buttons it is pretty funny

3025
03:01:01,600 --> 03:01:04,680
though if you're going Otacon check that out hi Aaron orange launch radio who's

3026
03:01:04,680 --> 03:01:09,200
this Zaku Zaku I was just reading a comment of yours is this call about

3027
03:01:09,200 --> 03:01:14,660
anime next or what yeah I was there that weekend and I didn't room with Adam this

3028
03:01:14,660 --> 03:01:19,200
year but I managed to find enough cash to go and split a room with someone else

3029
03:01:19,200 --> 03:01:23,960
even though it wasn't far it was no wasn't far from the venue but I still

3030
03:01:23,960 --> 03:01:29,840
managed to make it regardless oh just to just to touch up on what he briefly said

3031
03:01:29,840 --> 03:01:33,960
I kind of had a different experience this year in anime next I mean the venue

3032
03:01:33,960 --> 03:01:39,040
kicked severe ass because it was it was a lot better in terms of the game room

3033
03:01:39,040 --> 03:01:42,680
being big and all and actually have it separate rooms but I don't know I just

3034
03:01:42,680 --> 03:01:45,920
wasn't feeling it this year I mean previous years it was pretty I was

3035
03:01:45,920 --> 03:01:49,440
pretty much hyped and it pretty much went through but I don't know I guess

3036
03:01:49,440 --> 03:01:54,280
this year when I'd have been like a I'd have been you know wasn't what I expected

3037
03:01:54,280 --> 03:01:58,280
but whatever guess we'll try for the next year what anyway what was missing

3038
03:01:58,280 --> 03:02:03,000
for you was it was the game room lacking or what no the game room was fine that

3039
03:02:03,000 --> 03:02:06,720
was I had nothing to do with it it's just like it wasn't I don't know if for

3040
03:02:06,720 --> 03:02:10,560
some reason I wasn't really getting into some of the other panels I see like when

3041
03:02:10,560 --> 03:02:13,920
I first went to anime next two years ago I was really getting into an adult swim

3042
03:02:13,920 --> 03:02:19,200
panel that I got in there and maybe a couple of anime but it wasn't I wasn't

3043
03:02:19,200 --> 03:02:23,320
feeling it this year unfortunately I'm sorry I'll let you get to whatever your

3044
03:02:23,320 --> 03:02:27,000
anyways is but I have been to a lot of conventions myself and I'm not even that

3045
03:02:27,000 --> 03:02:30,240
super into anime but I've seen a lot of piss-poor panels at conventions I'm

3046
03:02:30,240 --> 03:02:35,280
sorry to say there's not like no nice way for me to say it yeah people stop

3047
03:02:35,280 --> 03:02:40,360
using panels as an excuse to get a free badge and fucking do do a good panel and

3048
03:02:40,360 --> 03:02:44,840
this goes both ways convention organizers screen your panelists better

3049
03:02:44,840 --> 03:02:50,280
do not let your friend host a panel because they are your friend unless that

3050
03:02:50,280 --> 03:02:55,680
friend is able to produce an outline ideas like everyone should have to knock

3051
03:02:55,680 --> 03:02:59,600
it off you're ruining your own con anyway sorry well there was there was

3052
03:02:59,600 --> 03:03:03,240
the particular one that I wanted to go to but you know it had to do with

3053
03:03:03,240 --> 03:03:07,320
Bahmani stuff it was actually on Friday but by the time I made it there I was

3054
03:03:07,320 --> 03:03:11,680
you know I had to like take my roommate to the hotel and check in and get food

3055
03:03:11,680 --> 03:03:16,080
so I pretty much missed it by the time I got there what exactly are those Bahmani

3056
03:03:16,080 --> 03:03:20,120
panels like these days damn we're in trouble no idea but it was held on

3057
03:03:20,120 --> 03:03:24,920
Friday and Friday evening and I had to arrive in the con at that time to get my

3058
03:03:24,920 --> 03:03:28,500
badge so it wasn't even worth it they were nice enough to let me sit in on the

3059
03:03:28,500 --> 03:03:32,080
bahmanistyle.com panel at ASEN and you know as cool as it was to be

3060
03:03:32,080 --> 03:03:35,200
sitting with some of those folks I really didn't feel like there was a lot

3061
03:03:35,200 --> 03:03:39,340
to talk about a lot of the discussions focused around the concert that had

3062
03:03:39,340 --> 03:03:42,400
happened the night before which is cool for the folks that are into that type of

3063
03:03:42,400 --> 03:03:45,000
music I felt really lost or what have you because I haven't been following a

3064
03:03:45,000 --> 03:03:48,100
lot of new Ryan's but when it came to actual talk on the Bahmani games like

3065
03:03:48,100 --> 03:03:53,440
half of it was a joke it was it right anyway most of it for you know I even

3066
03:03:53,440 --> 03:03:56,520
though I wasn't I wasn't actually there an ace and I could have could only

3067
03:03:56,520 --> 03:04:00,920
imagine it's probably like insider info probably like inside joke something that

3068
03:04:00,920 --> 03:04:04,960
would be a lot of inside jokes in the line you had any ways a minute ago

3069
03:04:04,960 --> 03:04:09,820
Zaku please please go ahead with your anyways anyways I would basically a

3070
03:04:09,820 --> 03:04:13,680
reason I call tonight is because you know I don't know if you probably know

3071
03:04:13,680 --> 03:04:19,640
this but DDRX apparently hit arcades last week and the first one being the

3072
03:04:19,640 --> 03:04:23,680
Levo the game works in Chicago that managed to get the first the first new

3073
03:04:23,680 --> 03:04:30,540
cabin in the country and from from the initial reviews horrible let's just let

3074
03:04:30,540 --> 03:04:34,320
just put it this way the fact that the cab managed to go down to the the cabin

3075
03:04:34,320 --> 03:04:40,080
itself managed to go down to $10,000 as opposed to 15 you know previous releases

3076
03:04:40,080 --> 03:04:46,720
they pretty much cut many corners noticeable corners like a laggy H you

3077
03:04:46,720 --> 03:04:51,080
know like the LCD monitor a pad that's like half the the thickness of the

3078
03:04:51,080 --> 03:04:56,920
original one the sense you know sensors in the arrows are pretty much they're

3079
03:04:56,920 --> 03:05:00,560
just triggering or not even home just triggering spread and spontaneous so

3080
03:05:00,560 --> 03:05:05,800
you're not holding it all just a lot of bullshit on that part run on the part of

3081
03:05:05,800 --> 03:05:10,920
maybe bets in or an army for that matter just producing piss for new cabinets you

3082
03:05:10,920 --> 03:05:15,160
know what I'm not surprised go back to last week's show as far as I'm concerned

3083
03:05:15,160 --> 03:05:19,880
wheel that machine out to the barn and put a bullet in it it's done yeah at

3084
03:05:19,880 --> 03:05:24,760
this point is like people are just writing DDRX off at this point because

3085
03:05:24,760 --> 03:05:28,840
of the fact that the cabinets are just giving it a they're just giving it a bad

3086
03:05:28,840 --> 03:05:34,240
rap I'm like I mean the upgrade kids haven't even been released yet but we

3087
03:05:34,240 --> 03:05:38,800
have yet to see how they fare but so far the new cabinets just they're not

3088
03:05:38,800 --> 03:05:44,280
sitting well with the fans the hardcore players I'm sadly not surprised that go

3089
03:05:44,280 --> 03:05:46,840
we got to let you go so we can wrap up the show but thanks so much for calling

3090
03:05:46,840 --> 03:05:51,800
in all right take care they're a little fatter too and nobody likes fat is it

3091
03:05:51,800 --> 03:05:54,560
just me or does it sound like and we're gonna turn off the Skype for tonight so

3092
03:05:54,560 --> 03:05:56,720
we can wrap up the show but thank you guys so much if you didn't get in

3093
03:05:56,720 --> 03:05:59,760
remember you can always send us an email mailbag at orange laundry calm we do

3094
03:05:59,760 --> 03:06:04,160
want your voice to be heard it is just me it sounds like this new

3095
03:06:04,160 --> 03:06:08,280
machine like is like two DDR solo pads put together when you talk about the

3096
03:06:08,280 --> 03:06:12,040
less responsive arrows and the thinner pads or whatever it sounds like a DDR

3097
03:06:12,040 --> 03:06:15,640
solo machine all right I was like cutting costs to me you have a perfectly

3098
03:06:15,640 --> 03:06:20,200
good cabinet that's worked for how many years now let's go and change it that's

3099
03:06:20,200 --> 03:06:25,760
an awesome idea I never thought I would say this seven years ago when this whole

3100
03:06:25,760 --> 03:06:29,440
show started and yes we're coming up on our seven seven year anniversary so show

3101
03:06:29,440 --> 03:06:35,000
in two weeks believe it or not this first show is June 23rd 2002 I never

3102
03:06:35,000 --> 03:06:39,560
thought I would say this seven years ago but we've talked too much about DDR the

3103
03:06:39,560 --> 03:06:44,280
past two shows like that's how relevant it is right now in this world we can

3104
03:06:44,280 --> 03:06:48,480
bring it back I could bring it back they just know the confidence in me no it's

3105
03:06:48,480 --> 03:06:53,720
it's not gonna happen oh it would sorry Loki it would but it's not going it

3106
03:06:53,720 --> 03:06:57,880
could yes it could all right we got to go around and get everybody's final

3107
03:06:57,880 --> 03:07:02,000
thought and wrap up the show tonight and take care of it oh did you have any

3108
03:07:02,000 --> 03:07:06,000
other like last things you want to even talk release dates oh my god we didn't

3109
03:07:06,000 --> 03:07:09,400
do we want to go over those real quick could do that that's what happens when

3110
03:07:09,400 --> 03:07:13,160
you try a new format is that you forget shit all right well then Loki why don't

3111
03:07:13,160 --> 03:07:16,240
you go over some release dates for the u.s. before we wrap it up all right well

3112
03:07:16,240 --> 03:07:20,360
this week we've got a quite a few games coming out but something you probably

3113
03:07:20,360 --> 03:07:28,040
want to pick up Ghostbusters coming out on PlayStation 2 3 Xbox 360 we DS and PS

3114

3116
03:07:42,400 --> 03:07:47,240

3117
03:07:47,240 --> 03:07:52,720
DS it's weird I actually played the import of the European one and it's kind

3118
03:07:52,720 --> 03:07:58,640
of weird guitar heroes smash hits coming out on PlayStation 2 3 Xbox 360 and the

3119
03:07:58,640 --> 03:08:06,560
Wii if you're into more of the sim games discovery kids parrot pals and diva

3120
03:08:06,560 --> 03:08:14,080
girls divas on ice on Wii and the DS Monster Hunter freedom unite on PSP

3121
03:08:14,080 --> 03:08:19,000
that's gonna be pretty awesome and that's pretty much it

3122
03:08:19,000 --> 03:08:23,000
Japan's looking a little thin on the releases this week but you do get a

3123
03:08:23,000 --> 03:08:27,120
price drop on Metal Gear Solid four guns of the Patriots on June 18th on the

3124
03:08:27,120 --> 03:08:30,880
PlayStation 3 remember this is Japanese release dates I'm reading right now

3125
03:08:30,880 --> 03:08:34,960
sometimes they get cool stuff before we do right now they're not getting a lot

3126
03:08:34,960 --> 03:08:37,920
there isn't a single thing of note coming out on the Wii this week believe

3127
03:08:37,920 --> 03:08:41,320
it or not and usually in Japan even a slow week you have something coming out

3128
03:08:41,320 --> 03:08:45,080
on the Wii on the PlayStation 2 you have a couple other price drops going on

3129
03:08:45,080 --> 03:08:49,480
mostly they are Neo Geo games like King of Fighters maximum impact regulation a

3130
03:08:49,480 --> 03:08:53,680
metal slug complete samurai spirits all of those games are getting price

3131
03:08:53,680 --> 03:08:58,840
reductions and perhaps this is in preparation for the sunsoft collection

3132
03:08:58,840 --> 03:09:01,360
which is also coming out I think that's actually another price drop though

3133
03:09:01,360 --> 03:09:04,520
they're all get just price drop price drop price drop this week over in Japan

3134
03:09:04,520 --> 03:09:09,840

looking at the PSP fate unlimited codes portable comes out this week from Capcom

3148
03:10:25,080 --> 03:10:31,040
on the PSP that looks to be a fun little game especially if you're into those

3149
03:10:31,040 --> 03:10:36,040
Japanese fighting games I have some rapid-fire last-minute stories once you

3153
03:10:46,960 --> 03:10:49,760
actually being over here cuz you know being in this little room doesn't feel

3154
03:10:49,760 --> 03:10:53,880
sort of like the old school way we did it it does get go it does but Dan is

3155
03:10:53,880 --> 03:10:57,320
making arrangements for us potentially yeah I'm hearing we might move to where

3156
03:10:57,320 --> 03:11:01,120
the pinball machines are now you give me a little earlier to the garage where we

3157
03:11:01,120 --> 03:11:03,240
met that we might bump the pinball machines for the show could be

3158
03:11:03,240 --> 03:11:07,920
interesting but we we did trade creatures in the Black Lagoon for Lord

3159
03:11:07,920 --> 03:11:13,720
of the Rings I miss not broken already I miss not having to commute but I guess

3160
03:11:13,720 --> 03:11:16,520
if you guys have done it for so long I can do it for a little while at least so

3161
03:11:16,520 --> 03:11:21,480
yeah well how about our your European releases how about it on the 16th we

3162
03:11:21,480 --> 03:11:26,760
have Wallace and Gromit's grand adventures muzzled for PC and on 17th we

3163
03:11:26,760 --> 03:11:30,960
have rocket riot which kind of sounds a little dirty to me the 18th Metal Gear

3164
03:11:30,960 --> 03:11:35,680
Solid on PlayStation 3 and then the 19th we have rock band unplugged virtual

3165
03:11:35,680 --> 03:11:43,480
tennis 2009 and Ghostbusters Ghostbusters by the way yes I really

3166
03:11:43,480 --> 03:11:47,880
like that infamous game really yeah good somebody was just asking a little while

3167
03:11:47,880 --> 03:11:50,920
ago why we don't talk about it on the show I haven't played much of it just

3168
03:11:50,920 --> 03:11:55,520
because I've had a whole lot going on you know but it's totally between the

3169
03:11:55,520 --> 03:11:59,800
guy coasting through the air with electricity and then being spider-man

3170
03:11:59,800 --> 03:12:05,440
it's kind of funny meet the guy from crackdown I'm glad you said something

3171
03:12:05,440 --> 03:12:08,480
about it I hope the listener who sent in that email listens to the end of the

3172
03:12:08,480 --> 03:12:13,520
show so there you go all right Loki had some other stories you want to get to

3173
03:12:13,520 --> 03:12:19,240
yes well what game out there could possibly create a peripheral that is 20

3174
03:12:19,240 --> 03:12:23,440
times more expensive than the game itself well that game of course would be

3175
03:12:23,440 --> 03:12:30,600
virtual on they do have a $300 arcade stick that you can get for the Xbox

3176
03:12:30,600 --> 03:12:35,980
360 version it is from hori and yes it is 20 times the cost of the game which

3177
03:12:35,980 --> 03:12:41,600
is only 15 bucks but it does have the twin sticks and go crazy with that so I

3178
03:12:41,600 --> 03:12:46,800
wonder if you know how they had those little converter units where you could

3179
03:12:46,800 --> 03:12:51,320
use like a PlayStation controller on the Xbox 360 you know the different ones you

3180
03:12:51,320 --> 03:12:56,920
have to remap them and everything I wonder if there wouldn't be some type of

3181
03:12:56,920 --> 03:13:01,040
converter that they can make the work use my dreamcast sticks I don't know I

3182
03:13:01,040 --> 03:13:05,400
was then again I can just play it on dreamcast this is gonna sound so random

3183
03:13:05,400 --> 03:13:10,120
but I have to say something I just realized you're wearing a DDR spot.com

3184
03:13:10,120 --> 03:13:14,960
shirt yes I am that is fucking old school you know when I got this shirt

3185
03:13:14,960 --> 03:13:20,960
yeah I got this shirt at my madness sure has to be as old as this show

3186
03:13:20,960 --> 03:13:29,480
older I threw I threw away the other day my DDR mania X shirt I still have two

3187
03:13:29,480 --> 03:13:33,000
DDR freak shirts left to you but now keep in mind no this is the thing

3188
03:13:33,000 --> 03:13:38,160

3189

3190
03:13:42,960 --> 03:13:50,160
shirt I can wear without a bra well thanks for sharing okay low-key sorry

3191
03:13:50,160 --> 03:13:54,360
well with the news of Left 4 Dead 2 possibly dividing the community maybe

3192
03:13:54,360 --> 03:13:59,240
this will bring the community back together Left 4 Dead has finally got a

3193
03:13:59,240 --> 03:14:04,960
nude Zoe mod for PC version yes that's right what came out what came out there

3194
03:14:04,960 --> 03:14:08,480
with a female character would not be complete without a nude mod so I think

3195
03:14:08,480 --> 03:14:13,880
we can all agree on that that nudity mods are a must and that's available on

3196
03:14:13,880 --> 03:14:24,440
L4D mods.com got a lot of stuff nudity brings us together yes see here

3197
03:14:24,440 --> 03:14:31,400
apparently Final Fantasy Tactics has been raided by the ESRB and people

3198
03:14:31,400 --> 03:14:35,160
believe it's coming to the PlayStation Network sounds about right to me nice

3199
03:14:35,160 --> 03:14:40,840
releasing a lonely crap nice I've been I have been so Jones and for the old

3200
03:14:40,840 --> 03:14:44,320
school Final Fantasy Tactics like before it was on DS and all the other ones I

3201
03:14:44,320 --> 03:14:49,680
really want to play like on my TV again Final Fantasy Tactics that Oh happy

3202
03:14:49,680 --> 03:14:53,920
happy Rob yes kind of sad that I'll have to buy it all over again because I can't

3203
03:14:53,920 --> 03:14:57,200
find my original PlayStation 1 disc but what can you do at least I'll have my

3204
03:14:57,200 --> 03:14:59,720
Final Fantasy 8 discs so when they release that I'm not going to buy it

3205
03:14:59,720 --> 03:15:02,400
because I still have my discs so I could play it on the PlayStation 3 if I wanted

3206
03:15:02,400 --> 03:15:08,560
to yes apparently there's a rumor that Sony is going to unveil PSP Go apps and

3207
03:15:08,560 --> 03:15:14,320
small games at gamescom and these are supposed to be of course non retail

3208
03:15:14,320 --> 03:15:19,680
games and applications for the PSP and the file sizes are said to be limited to

3209
03:15:19,680 --> 03:15:23,520
100 megabytes but developers and publishers will be limited other create

3210
03:15:23,520 --> 03:15:29,400
other creative ways Sony is said to have some specifically stated non game apps

3211
03:15:29,400 --> 03:15:41,840
and 2d tiles are more than welcome maker comparisons to iPhone now yes God I

3212
03:15:41,840 --> 03:15:45,960
don't want to report on this but apparently there is another teaser site

3213
03:15:45,960 --> 03:15:54,680
in Japan now for a brand new tingle game and I weep with sadness I weep tears of

3214
03:15:54,680 --> 03:16:02,200
joy thank you for reporting that Loki is that it and finally Nintendo apparently

3215
03:16:02,200 --> 03:16:11,560
has according I guess Guardian media technologies it was one of the patent

3216
03:16:11,560 --> 03:16:15,520
lawsuits that Nintendo had to deal with well it's been thrown out of the court

3217
03:16:15,520 --> 03:16:20,680
it says we are very pleased with the court's decision and Nintendo vigorously

3218
03:16:20,680 --> 03:16:24,360
defends its patent lawsuits and at the earliest stages of this case Nintendo

3219
03:16:24,360 --> 03:16:28,760
convinced the court to dismiss the case as guardians patent had nothing to do

3220
03:16:28,760 --> 03:16:33,080
with Nintendo's products well I and I would despite all the crap I give

3221
03:16:33,080 --> 03:16:35,520
Nintendo I think I agree with them here there's too many of these frivolous

3222
03:16:35,520 --> 03:16:40,080
patent lawsuits if there's a patent lawsuit that's out there and they find

3223
03:16:40,080 --> 03:16:43,720
that they have you know infringed on that patent then how could there be

3224
03:16:43,720 --> 03:16:48,000
multiple lawsuits later on for the same types of things because I think at that

3225
03:16:48,000 --> 03:16:51,600
case well you've already found that you've been infringing on this patent

3226
03:16:51,600 --> 03:16:54,960
you need to go after that person because that's the person that has a patent for

3227
03:16:54,960 --> 03:17:00,560
it not Nintendo and that's it all right well that's gonna do it here for another

3228
03:17:00,560 --> 03:17:04,760

make Star Trek 5 a good movie you do know they're on like Star Trek 10 at this

03:17:57,480 --> 03:18:00,160
anniversary and I don't know if we're doing anything special for the seventh

3243
03:18:00,160 --> 03:18:03,760
anniversary because the planning wasn't really two weeks is our seventh

3244
03:18:03,760 --> 03:18:08,260

but you know what hmm I have my next assessment you know what I'm gonna

3246
03:18:14,400 --> 03:18:18,200
actually email the teacher and ask if I can go do the assessment earlier in the

3247
03:18:18,200 --> 03:18:22,040
day and that might be a good idea and I don't know if we'll do anything special

3248
