1
00:00:16,272 --> 00:00:16,773
[SPEAKER_09]: and more.

2
00:00:31,872 --> 00:00:32,953
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

3
00:00:49,651 --> 00:00:51,292
[SPEAKER_02]: We still got Tech Master Loki here tonight

4
00:01:11,562 --> 00:01:12,162
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, I'm here.

5
00:01:12,303 --> 00:01:13,703
[SPEAKER_02]: The very busy Techmaster Loki.

6
00:01:13,943 --> 00:01:14,644
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, I'm moving.

7
00:01:14,984 --> 00:01:16,945
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, you've been moving lately.

8
00:01:16,985 --> 00:01:17,606
[SPEAKER_02]: How's that going?

9
00:01:17,626 --> 00:01:19,587
[SPEAKER_03]: It sucks.

10
00:01:20,307 --> 00:01:20,647
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah?

11
00:01:21,068 --> 00:01:21,788
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

12
00:01:22,008 --> 00:01:26,431
[SPEAKER_02]: But I don't know if the listeners are aware, but you actually moved from an apartment to your house.

13
00:01:26,771 --> 00:01:29,172
[SPEAKER_02]: Not a rented house, but one you have actually purchased.

14
00:01:29,293 --> 00:01:29,553
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

15
00:01:29,753 --> 00:01:32,975
[SPEAKER_02]: In this very sad economy, you were actually able to make it work.

16
00:01:33,135 --> 00:01:35,776
[SPEAKER_02]: Someone else's misfortune turned into your gain.

17
00:01:35,876 --> 00:01:36,717
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Fannie Mae.

18
00:01:38,883 --> 00:01:39,443
[SPEAKER_03]: No, seriously.

19
00:01:39,483 --> 00:01:42,104
[SPEAKER_03]: They had a really kick-ass loan deal.

20
00:01:42,684 --> 00:01:44,405
[SPEAKER_03]: Got a really low interest rate.

21
00:01:44,985 --> 00:01:52,228
[SPEAKER_03]: Normally, buyers like us, because we're not putting down a lot of money, you would have to pay mortgage insurance, which...

22
00:01:53,789 --> 00:01:54,290
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura.com

23
00:02:13,311 --> 00:02:13,631
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.

24
00:02:13,871 --> 00:02:14,492
[SPEAKER_02]: We can do that.

25
00:02:14,572 --> 00:02:16,472
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a little jealous, but see, I'm not married.

26
00:02:16,512 --> 00:02:18,713
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't have someone to share that type of income with.

27
00:02:19,013 --> 00:02:21,934
[SPEAKER_02]: People say you can get a roommate and so on and so on to make it work, but I just don't.

28
00:02:22,295 --> 00:02:22,955
[SPEAKER_02]: It would be tough.

29
00:02:23,015 --> 00:02:25,536
[SPEAKER_02]: It would be tough because what happens if you can't find one?

30
00:02:25,696 --> 00:02:27,917
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the situation I find myself in.

31
00:02:27,937 --> 00:02:28,997
[SPEAKER_03]: Or if they leave.

32
00:02:29,297 --> 00:02:30,878
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it would just be difficult.

33
00:02:31,349 --> 00:02:31,769
[SPEAKER_02]: Outro Music

34
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:48,482
[SPEAKER_02]: Congratulations.

35
00:02:48,522 --> 00:02:56,913
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a good time to do it because that government program where you get eight grand back in your taxes next year, that's putting a new roof on our house.

36
00:02:57,093 --> 00:02:57,354
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.

37
00:02:57,374 --> 00:02:58,555
[SPEAKER_03]: That'd be awesome.

38
00:02:58,956 --> 00:03:00,758
[SPEAKER_02]: Quick, anyone want to get married, buy a house with me?

39
00:03:00,778 --> 00:03:01,339
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I'm just kidding.

40
00:03:03,395 --> 00:03:07,198
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my gosh, it's definitely a time to buy.

41
00:03:07,538 --> 00:03:14,602
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, bringing it back to video games, since that's what our show is all about, since it is now your house, are you doing anything special with the tech?

42
00:03:15,563 --> 00:03:24,789
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know necessarily the games, because I know the wife is not a fan of games not called Excite Truck or Bejeweled, but I know you were talking about something tech that you're doing with the babies.

43
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:31,313
[SPEAKER_03]: I was thinking it would be cool to do video monitors, because usually how you do

44
00:03:31,906 --> 00:03:34,187
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, like a baby monitor that's audio or something like that.

45
00:03:34,527 --> 00:03:44,529
[SPEAKER_03]: But they had a commercial that I saw on TV for like Home Depot or something like that where some guy was doing a project where he had video monitoring for their babies.

46
00:03:45,069 --> 00:03:51,670
[SPEAKER_03]: But having two of those and we can do picture-in-picture on TV while we're watching TV and stuff, you can see the two babies there.

47
00:03:52,170 --> 00:03:52,551
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

48
00:03:53,571 --> 00:03:58,392
[SPEAKER_03]: That would probably be really expensive and a lot of work for something that's kind of neat.

49
00:03:58,832 --> 00:03:59,072
[SPEAKER_03]: But...

50
00:04:00,578 --> 00:04:00,938
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see.

51
00:04:01,518 --> 00:04:02,419
[SPEAKER_03]: Mainly network stuff.

52
00:04:02,439 --> 00:04:10,842
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to have to run a bunch of networking stuff through our attic because I can't stretch a 50-foot Cat 5 cable anymore.

53
00:04:12,803 --> 00:04:16,825
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be interesting to see how your stories change once those babies are born.

54
00:04:17,205 --> 00:04:20,206
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm very curious to see what's going to change in the house of Loki.

55
00:04:20,766 --> 00:04:21,286
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see.

56
00:04:22,267 --> 00:04:23,247
[SPEAKER_02]: Congratulations on the house.

57
00:04:23,287 --> 00:04:26,709
[SPEAKER_02]: I helped him move into it Saturday because that's what friends do.

58
00:04:26,729 --> 00:04:27,929
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a nice house.

59
00:04:30,774 --> 00:04:33,716
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very similar to the one I rent, but I only rent it.

60
00:04:33,916 --> 00:04:38,899
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, you know, with the hardwood floors and the one bathroom and three bedrooms, and the bedrooms are a little small.

61
00:04:38,919 --> 00:04:40,280
[SPEAKER_02]: I had to put in those floors.

62
00:04:42,061 --> 00:04:44,282
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, they're the laminate.

63
00:04:44,482 --> 00:04:46,483
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a particle board.

64
00:04:46,503 --> 00:04:48,424
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of like this desk.

65
00:04:49,485 --> 00:04:51,506
[SPEAKER_02]: More comments from chat.orangelaunchradio.com.

66
00:04:51,526 --> 00:04:54,388
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're listening to us on All Games Radio Live on this Sunday night, please join us.

67
00:04:54,768 --> 00:04:55,228
[SPEAKER_02]: Say hello.

68
00:04:55,589 --> 00:04:57,130
[SPEAKER_02]: Deekman says, you stream it.

69
00:04:57,450 --> 00:04:58,070
[SPEAKER_02]: Or too creepy.

70
00:04:58,530 --> 00:04:59,431
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's a little too creepy.

71
00:05:00,290 --> 00:05:01,911
[SPEAKER_02]: It's gonna be boring.

72
00:05:02,111 --> 00:05:03,811
[SPEAKER_02]: Who would watch baby monitors on YouTube?

73
00:05:03,831 --> 00:05:06,052
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I guess you'd be surprised.

74
00:05:07,632 --> 00:05:10,893
[SPEAKER_02]: And Toshin says, Loki, my neighbor has a video baby monitor.

75
00:05:11,174 --> 00:05:11,854
[SPEAKER_02]: I could get info.

76
00:05:13,334 --> 00:05:17,736
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure it's easy to do because it's just, I think it's just video.

77
00:05:17,776 --> 00:05:19,036
[SPEAKER_03]: You probably wouldn't do audio.

78
00:05:19,556 --> 00:05:25,678
[SPEAKER_03]: And so it'd basically just be running the video line through the ceiling to wherever you're gonna watch it, I guess.

79
00:05:26,058 --> 00:05:28,139
[SPEAKER_03]: Or they may even have it, you know, Wi-Fi.

80
00:05:28,922 --> 00:05:30,144
[SPEAKER_03]: Which would make things even easier.

81
00:05:30,164 --> 00:05:31,305
[SPEAKER_03]: They wouldn't have to run anything.

82
00:05:32,346 --> 00:05:35,470
[SPEAKER_02]: Deekman in chat says, Loki, get the angel care baby monitors.

83
00:05:35,550 --> 00:05:37,032
[SPEAKER_02]: It beeps if the baby doesn't move.

84
00:05:37,793 --> 00:05:39,956
[SPEAKER_02]: So advice from another parent, because I know Deekman.

85
00:05:40,496 --> 00:05:43,760
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that like the, was it everything's okay alarm?

86
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:44,041
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all me.

87
00:05:45,031 --> 00:05:45,712
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

88
00:06:04,065 --> 00:06:04,485
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura.com

89
00:06:23,197 --> 00:06:24,538
[SPEAKER_03]: Our cat did not like moving.

90
00:06:25,058 --> 00:06:33,624
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's pretty cool that you have, like, you know, that we've been doing this show long enough and we have such an awesome listener base that essentially the listeners are offering to babysit your children via your stream.

91
00:06:34,084 --> 00:06:36,445
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I don't know.

92
00:06:36,485 --> 00:06:36,746
[SPEAKER_02]: That's...

93
00:06:39,249 --> 00:06:39,729
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

94
00:07:02,589 --> 00:07:09,471
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I remember playing one thing I played at Sega Rally All-Stars or I don't know.

95
00:07:09,891 --> 00:07:13,472
[SPEAKER_03]: It's some sort of Mario Kart with Sega characters game.

96
00:07:14,252 --> 00:07:16,513
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was like Mario Kart with Sega characters game.

97
00:07:16,733 --> 00:07:20,874
[SPEAKER_03]: But no, what's weird though is they had commentators, which is odd.

98
00:07:21,534 --> 00:07:24,655
[SPEAKER_03]: I was not imagining commentators in that kind of game.

99
00:07:25,307 --> 00:07:28,008
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that the game that's supposed to have Greg Proops as the commentator?

100
00:07:28,028 --> 00:07:28,588
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, no.

101
00:07:28,648 --> 00:07:29,408
[SPEAKER_03]: That's Mad World.

102
00:07:29,488 --> 00:07:30,248
[SPEAKER_03]: That's awesome.

103
00:07:30,469 --> 00:07:30,989
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that's right.

104
00:07:31,029 --> 00:07:32,449
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, I was going to cut him up.

105
00:07:32,549 --> 00:07:35,010
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be... That's already out.

106
00:07:35,030 --> 00:07:35,590
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry.

107
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:37,190
[SPEAKER_03]: Why did I think that was a racing game?

108
00:07:37,431 --> 00:07:46,193
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, but hey, if they want to come back and do commentary in that game, not changing up any of the language whatsoever might actually make that game good.

109
00:07:46,213 --> 00:07:47,053
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I...

110
00:07:50,089 --> 00:07:50,810
[SPEAKER_03]: So I played that.

111
00:07:50,850 --> 00:07:55,633
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that was on Thursday when I was just like, eh, I don't know what I want to do.

112
00:07:55,733 --> 00:07:57,254
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm going to start playing some random games.

113
00:07:57,294 --> 00:08:01,257
[SPEAKER_03]: I watch people play a lot of stuff, but I don't know.

114
00:08:01,297 --> 00:08:07,421
[SPEAKER_03]: This week I actually played more Grand Theft Auto 4 because we play that every day.

115
00:08:08,602 --> 00:08:09,283
[SPEAKER_03]: I played...

116
00:08:11,661 --> 00:08:13,382
[SPEAKER_03]: Some prototype, which is fun.

117
00:08:13,722 --> 00:08:18,164
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really underwhelming as far as graphics go.

118
00:08:18,384 --> 00:08:25,986
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's very plain looking, but if you think about the developer of the game, they actually were the ones that did the Hulk, the ultimate destruction stuff.

119
00:08:26,087 --> 00:08:34,030
[SPEAKER_03]: It's very simple graphics, but it's the same type of gameplay where you can throw things in the stuff and just go crazy.

120
00:08:34,890 --> 00:08:40,232
[SPEAKER_03]: You can absorb people and take their life to boost your health and stuff like that.

121
00:08:40,672 --> 00:08:41,272
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

122
00:09:03,214 --> 00:09:03,935
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

123
00:09:18,874 --> 00:09:43,859
[SPEAKER_02]: and we get into the topic we got into like a few weeks ago talking about like Saw and that whole thing where like I can't watch the Saw movies because it's too real for me but when the violence is over the top yeah this is over the top okay like I think that stuff is funny like snapping people in half and stuff like that it's just ridiculous okay like Mortal Kombat over the top always has been you can grab somebody you know and just run into the ground with them or like there was one that they had in a video where he grabs a soldier and

124
00:09:44,179 --> 00:09:44,739
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

125
00:10:10,165 --> 00:10:10,625
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

126
00:10:27,173 --> 00:10:29,574
[SPEAKER_03]: Angry Barry, which is an XNA game.

127
00:10:29,954 --> 00:10:37,057
[SPEAKER_03]: It's basically Obama the game, the fighting, it's like a Final Fight type game.

128
00:10:37,298 --> 00:10:38,518
[SPEAKER_03]: It's absolutely ridiculous.

129
00:10:38,878 --> 00:10:43,981
[SPEAKER_03]: The problem is it's broken on Xbox community games right now.

130
00:10:44,281 --> 00:10:46,902
[SPEAKER_03]: You can download the game and it won't boot up at all.

131
00:10:47,342 --> 00:10:48,943
[SPEAKER_03]: And you waste money, which sucks.

132
00:10:49,443 --> 00:10:58,532
[SPEAKER_02]: But, Angry Barry... Wait, don't these things have to go through like a... Yeah, they should, and it pissed me off because it was working, so apparently he updated something and it broke it.

133
00:10:59,112 --> 00:11:04,538
[SPEAKER_03]: So, now I paid for this and I can't play it, and it's really making me sad because...

134
00:11:04,918 --> 00:11:09,160
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm actually looking at some footage of this here in studio off of YouTube.

135
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:10,181
[SPEAKER_03]: It's absolutely ridiculous.

136
00:11:10,201 --> 00:11:14,763
[SPEAKER_03]: You can pick up... The first level, you're apparently fighting old ladies.

137
00:11:15,403 --> 00:11:17,564
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, yeah, cat ladies in Central Park.

138
00:11:17,664 --> 00:11:21,446
[SPEAKER_02]: On the start of his quest, Barry runs into a bunch of old dotties.

139
00:11:21,706 --> 00:11:22,327
[SPEAKER_02]: I went off the screen.

140
00:11:22,347 --> 00:11:23,347
[SPEAKER_02]: Wait, let me roll back a little bit.

141
00:11:23,687 --> 00:11:28,210
[SPEAKER_02]: A bunch of old dotties who have a much different idea of who should rule the world.

142
00:11:28,670 --> 00:11:32,712
[SPEAKER_02]: As he continues, Barry is haunted by a ghost from his past who may end his quest before it starts.

143
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:58,173
[SPEAKER_03]: and so basically the game's kind of funny because he runs around and he can punch things and stuff like that you punch people in the face but he can also pick up stuff like unrealistically like you know the park bench oh no it gets better it gets better he can pick up people by their heads and then he can also pick up like buses and stuff it's just let me fast forward absolutely ridiculous see there he picked up a jogger and he's like trying to smash people

144
00:11:58,413 --> 00:12:04,440
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, but the caliber quality of this game looks like somewhere between NES and Super Nintendo.

145
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:05,501
[SPEAKER_02]: It's awesome.

146
00:12:05,942 --> 00:12:08,244
[SPEAKER_02]: Somebody's running by yelling, have my baby, Barry.

147
00:12:12,309 --> 00:12:14,491
[SPEAKER_03]: Keep going until you get to the bus, because that's hilarious.

148
00:12:14,511 --> 00:12:16,674
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me fast forward a little ways here, if I can.

149
00:12:22,298 --> 00:12:25,021
[SPEAKER_02]: Part of me wonders if this is, like, really disrespectful.

150
00:12:25,121 --> 00:12:25,581
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

151
00:12:25,641 --> 00:12:26,262
[SPEAKER_02]: There's the bus.

152
00:12:26,582 --> 00:12:28,143
[SPEAKER_03]: This is awesome right here.

153
00:12:28,964 --> 00:12:31,146
[SPEAKER_03]: Bunch of old ladies getting on the bus.

154
00:12:31,166 --> 00:12:32,147
[SPEAKER_03]: Old ladies and stuff.

155
00:12:32,207 --> 00:12:34,889
[SPEAKER_03]: And he just picks up the bus and starts smashing old ladies.

156
00:12:35,509 --> 00:12:36,830
[SPEAKER_03]: That's awesome.

157
00:12:36,871 --> 00:12:37,371
[SPEAKER_03]: Right there.

158
00:12:37,431 --> 00:12:38,752
[SPEAKER_03]: That was instant purchase for me.

159
00:12:38,772 --> 00:12:40,253
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, I must buy this game.

160
00:12:40,473 --> 00:12:41,915
[SPEAKER_03]: And I did, like, instantly.

161
00:12:42,375 --> 00:12:43,556
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

162
00:13:02,572 --> 00:13:03,293
[SPEAKER_03]: if it's broken.

163
00:13:03,713 --> 00:13:05,194
[SPEAKER_03]: And so hopefully they'll fix it.

164
00:13:05,514 --> 00:13:07,636
[SPEAKER_03]: It says I purchased it and then I'll get to play it.

165
00:13:07,936 --> 00:13:14,761
[SPEAKER_02]: SSJ100 Matt in our chatroom, chat.orange.radio.com wants to clarify, when the fixed version comes out, you can re-download it and it will be okay.

166
00:13:14,781 --> 00:13:14,861
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

167
00:13:14,881 --> 00:13:15,842
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't need to buy it again.

168
00:13:16,242 --> 00:13:23,167
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's AngryBerry, like B-A-R-R-Y, like Barack, not AngryBerry as in like Raspberry or Dingleberry.

169
00:13:23,347 --> 00:13:24,628
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, AngryBerry.

170
00:13:25,028 --> 00:13:25,329
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

171
00:13:25,469 --> 00:13:26,609
[SPEAKER_02]: And it looks awesome.

172
00:13:28,491 --> 00:13:28,991
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.

173
00:13:29,011 --> 00:13:30,372
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, anything else for your gaming week?

174
00:13:30,833 --> 00:13:30,953
[SPEAKER_02]: Um...

175
00:13:31,693 --> 00:13:32,994
[SPEAKER_02]: No, that's it for right now.

176
00:14:01,149 --> 00:14:03,630
[SPEAKER_03]: Besides, they have Need for Speed Shift now, if you wanted that.

177
00:14:03,730 --> 00:14:09,792
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, and the good news is, or, you know, the Forza series is continuing without them, and all that.

178
00:14:10,852 --> 00:14:19,394
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyhow... Project Gotham, I don't know if that's still... I'm sorry, yeah, Project Gotham, I don't know if that's continuing, but... I think it is.

179
00:14:19,614 --> 00:14:19,755
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

180
00:14:20,175 --> 00:14:27,757
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyhow, Blur is now like a realistic racing game, but it mixes that with the types of stuff you'd see in Mario Kart.

181
00:14:28,217 --> 00:14:29,278
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

182
00:14:52,236 --> 00:14:53,097
[SPEAKER_02]: All these different types of...

183
00:15:16,317 --> 00:15:19,960
[SPEAKER_02]: PowerUps in a Burnout-style arcade racer.

184
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:27,726
[SPEAKER_02]: Not where, like, you know, pile-ups and crashing cars is encouraged like it is in Burnout, but that sort of, like, look and speed and feel to the cars to it.

185
00:15:28,127 --> 00:15:34,111
[SPEAKER_02]: And the way they had it set up at E3 is that they had, like, 20 Xboxes all networked together, and everybody was essentially playing the same thing.

186
00:15:34,532 --> 00:15:36,153
[SPEAKER_02]: And I had a lot of fun playing it.

187
00:15:36,173 --> 00:15:37,714
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it'll be a fun game on Xbox Live.

188
00:15:37,974 --> 00:15:40,136
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like Mario Kart, but more real cars.

189
00:15:40,496 --> 00:15:44,560
[SPEAKER_02]: So, and from what I'm understanding, they're actually licensing real cars for this game.

190
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:44,780
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

191
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:47,702
[SPEAKER_02]: So, it's like real cars that shoot lightning.

192
00:15:48,402 --> 00:15:52,065
[SPEAKER_02]: So, it's a little strange, but it was actually a heck of a lot of fun to play.

193
00:15:52,085 --> 00:15:54,426
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I'm going to pick up the whole thing when it comes out.

194
00:15:54,726 --> 00:15:56,087
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know what you're thinking, Loki.

195
00:15:56,507 --> 00:15:58,909
[SPEAKER_02]: I know you didn't play it, but... Oh, no, you did play it a little bit, didn't you?

196
00:15:58,969 --> 00:15:59,129
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

197
00:15:59,529 --> 00:15:59,890
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that's right.

198
00:15:59,910 --> 00:16:01,391
[SPEAKER_02]: The Xbox broke when you sat on the plate.

199
00:16:01,411 --> 00:16:03,292
[SPEAKER_02]: The server crashed when I tried to play it.

200
00:16:03,312 --> 00:16:03,832
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.

201
00:16:04,953 --> 00:16:05,173
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope.

202
00:16:05,481 --> 00:16:06,102
[SPEAKER_02]: It looked fun.

203
00:16:07,924 --> 00:16:10,146
[SPEAKER_02]: Some other games I played at E3 that I wanted to point out.

204
00:16:11,447 --> 00:16:14,450
[SPEAKER_02]: White Knight Chronicles, I think we touched on a little bit last week.

205
00:16:14,831 --> 00:16:16,212
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't play it, but I watched Loki play it.

206
00:16:16,612 --> 00:16:18,014
[SPEAKER_02]: Looks like a lot of fun.

207
00:16:18,034 --> 00:16:19,375
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a role-playing game.

208
00:16:19,956 --> 00:16:23,419
[SPEAKER_02]: Looks pretty intensive, and I definitely want to check that out.

209
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:27,444
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a good exclusive for PlayStation 3, especially if you're the role-playing fan type.

210
00:16:28,064 --> 00:16:35,309
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, because it looks like it has the huge, uh, landscapes kind of like Oblivion does, but it's more of a third-person oriented game.

211
00:16:35,329 --> 00:16:37,091
[SPEAKER_03]: Reminds me a lot of Final Fantasy XI.

212
00:16:37,931 --> 00:16:39,852
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, the landscape's very similar to that.

213
00:16:39,892 --> 00:16:40,073
[SPEAKER_02]: Really?

214
00:16:40,093 --> 00:16:40,653
[SPEAKER_03]: There's zones.

215
00:16:41,434 --> 00:16:42,254
[SPEAKER_03]: Um... But not online.

216
00:16:42,294 --> 00:16:42,955
[SPEAKER_02]: This game was not online.

217
00:16:42,975 --> 00:16:43,715
[SPEAKER_03]: It's online, no.

218
00:16:44,216 --> 00:16:47,017
[SPEAKER_03]: You actually... Well, you can play online.

219
00:16:47,118 --> 00:16:50,280
[SPEAKER_03]: You can play online with a party of a few people, and then you can do that.

220
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:51,180
[SPEAKER_03]: Or it's AI.

221
00:16:51,461 --> 00:16:52,701
[SPEAKER_03]: And the AI actually is good.

222
00:16:52,742 --> 00:16:56,084
[SPEAKER_03]: They do what they're supposed to, and they're not doing retarded things.

223
00:16:56,564 --> 00:16:57,345
[SPEAKER_03]: So, um...

224
00:16:57,945 --> 00:16:58,726
[SPEAKER_03]: That's kind of cool.

225
00:16:59,526 --> 00:17:01,208
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think it is online, too.

226
00:17:01,548 --> 00:17:02,249
[SPEAKER_03]: So that might be fun.

227
00:17:02,789 --> 00:17:11,416
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think I ever mentioned last week that I did try out Katamari Forever, which is the new Katamari Damacy game on PlayStation 3 that takes some of the old levels and kind of repackages them.

228
00:17:11,676 --> 00:17:13,598
[SPEAKER_02]: And there are some newer levels, too.

229
00:17:13,638 --> 00:17:21,264
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, for instance, I played a level where you were rolling around the Katamari, and you would start in water, and then as you rolled around, you lost water.

230
00:17:21,304 --> 00:17:27,229
[SPEAKER_02]: Kind of like, imagine your Katamari's a giant sponge, and you're basically rolling it over dirt, and as you roll over the dirt, flowers grow.

231
00:17:27,669 --> 00:17:32,190
[SPEAKER_02]: So the idea was you tried to paint so much of the ground with flowers in the time limit.

232
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:40,973
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there's some secret, you know, the gal that was showing off the game was showing me there's some secret areas where you can find more water so you don't have to run back every time as you lose the water.

233
00:17:41,493 --> 00:17:44,274
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's kind of the strategy to get higher scores in that level.

234
00:17:44,634 --> 00:17:46,174
[SPEAKER_02]: So there are some new things in the game.

235
00:17:46,234 --> 00:17:49,255
[SPEAKER_02]: So Katamari Forever is not just a rehashing of the old stages.

236
00:17:50,175 --> 00:17:53,276
[SPEAKER_02]: The one thing that was cool about it is that they have different art styles.

237
00:17:53,296 --> 00:17:56,476
[SPEAKER_02]: There's very unique different art styles now that you can use.

238
00:17:56,816 --> 00:18:00,657
[SPEAKER_02]: Especially this whole where it starts all in black and white.

239
00:18:00,977 --> 00:18:05,258
[SPEAKER_02]: And then as you roll over objects, those objects will be in color anywhere you see them.

240
00:18:05,598 --> 00:18:06,438
[SPEAKER_02]: Which I thought was kind of cool.

241
00:18:06,458 --> 00:18:09,979
[SPEAKER_02]: So some of these new art styles they're adding are making the game feel...

242
00:18:10,519 --> 00:18:11,419
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

243
00:18:33,987 --> 00:18:39,351
[SPEAKER_02]: I already had more fun playing it than I did Beautiful Katamari on the 360, which I just never got into.

244
00:18:39,411 --> 00:18:40,192
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know what it is.

245
00:18:40,352 --> 00:18:41,673
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know what it was about that game.

246
00:18:41,693 --> 00:18:43,575
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe it's just the controller of all things.

247
00:18:43,975 --> 00:18:45,636
[SPEAKER_02]: I just could not get into Katamari on the 360.

248
00:18:46,477 --> 00:18:47,698
[SPEAKER_02]: But the PlayStation 3 one was fun.

249
00:18:47,918 --> 00:18:50,660
[SPEAKER_02]: They added a new game mechanic, too, where you can actually bounce.

250
00:18:51,181 --> 00:18:54,624
[SPEAKER_02]: You actually basically jump with the Katamari, which is a little unrealistic.

251
00:18:54,664 --> 00:18:59,868
[SPEAKER_02]: But hey, I mean, rolling around, rolling up entire islands in the earth is a little unrealistic, too.

252
00:18:59,948 --> 00:19:00,949
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I don't like...

253
00:19:01,509 --> 00:19:10,393
[SPEAKER_03]: The only thing I would change about Katamari is I don't like the action that you have to do, the motion to charge up your ball to do a little dash.

254
00:19:10,693 --> 00:19:18,756
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it should just be a button press, which would make things a lot easier because it's just a pain in the ass to kind of rock it back and forth to do that.

255
00:19:19,284 --> 00:19:22,887
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you know, I didn't try, actually try doing that, the dash.

256
00:19:22,927 --> 00:19:25,068
[SPEAKER_02]: I was playing too much with the jump and the whole, you know, flipping.

257
00:19:25,289 --> 00:19:31,193
[SPEAKER_02]: I like to do the, you know, you click the buttons and it flips the ball around, so you don't have to spend the whole time doing a turn.

258
00:19:31,293 --> 00:19:37,818
[SPEAKER_02]: But in the chat, Azure Edge is saying, in Japan, Katamari Forever is called Katamari Tribute.

259
00:19:37,838 --> 00:19:39,019
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's true.

260
00:19:39,279 --> 00:19:40,740
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a different name in Japan.

261
00:19:40,781 --> 00:19:42,442
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe it's already out over there, so...

262
00:19:44,291 --> 00:19:44,812
[SPEAKER_02]: It was fun.

263
00:19:45,072 --> 00:19:46,372
[SPEAKER_02]: I might pick it up.

264
00:19:46,572 --> 00:19:50,414
[SPEAKER_02]: I was under the impression, I don't know why, I thought this game was an arcade game when I first saw it.

265
00:19:50,454 --> 00:19:52,374
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a Sony download game, but it's not.

266
00:19:52,574 --> 00:19:53,875
[SPEAKER_02]: They told me it is coming out on disc.

267
00:19:54,495 --> 00:19:56,616
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's what people thought, and it is coming out on disc.

268
00:19:57,316 --> 00:19:59,257
[SPEAKER_02]: So it is a full disc game, just in case you weren't aware.

269
00:20:00,517 --> 00:20:05,999
[SPEAKER_02]: One other game I think I wanted to mention... I'm looking at my notes.

270
00:20:06,239 --> 00:20:07,980
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, Toy Story Midway Mania.

271
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:09,941
[SPEAKER_02]: I never mentioned this game, which is, you know...

272
00:20:10,481 --> 00:20:13,542
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't write it off as simply a child's little shoot-em game.

273
00:20:13,902 --> 00:20:17,143
[SPEAKER_02]: This is one for Disney fans, which I know some of our listeners are.

274
00:20:17,844 --> 00:20:21,725
[SPEAKER_02]: It is just like the ride that they have at Disneyland and Walt Disney World.

275
00:20:22,005 --> 00:20:23,466
[SPEAKER_02]: They opened them both up this year.

276
00:20:23,506 --> 00:20:25,806
[SPEAKER_02]: It's pretty much the same ride where you sit in the cars and go around.

277
00:20:26,067 --> 00:20:28,007
[SPEAKER_02]: However, they have added new stages.

278
00:20:28,027 --> 00:20:30,968
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a skee-ball type stage and some other little games.

279
00:20:31,368 --> 00:20:35,690
[SPEAKER_02]: Apparently, it's the whole thing where as you play more and get more points, you can unlock more mini-games.

280
00:20:36,090 --> 00:21:05,096
[SPEAKER_02]: but here's the funniest thing about it it is going to come with 3D glasses and you can play the games in 3D just like you do on the ride so I think that's kind of funny pretty cool yeah so I think this game is you know if you're a Disney fan for most people especially you really hardcore gamers you're going to look at this and go this is just another crappy Wii game with a bunch of you know little mini games but I think especially like if you have kids or you're just like a Disney fan and you have like for me it's the nostalgia of the ride and being at Disneyland that really does it for me

281
00:21:05,516 --> 00:21:06,236
[SPEAKER_02]: So, it's cool.

282
00:21:06,396 --> 00:21:07,637
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a cool little minigame collection.

283
00:21:07,917 --> 00:21:23,880
[SPEAKER_02]: The other one that I thought was kind of cool is a minigame in it that's kind of like Jenga, where these little block structures will appear, and you load this cannon with a ball, and then you kind of swing the Wiimote to throw the ball, and then depending on when and where you throw it, you're trying to knock over as many blocks as possible.

284
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:25,100
[SPEAKER_02]: Boom blocks!

285
00:21:25,220 --> 00:21:25,620
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome!

286
00:21:25,961 --> 00:21:26,201
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it?

287
00:21:26,261 --> 00:21:28,301
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's kind of a ripoff of that, I guess.

288
00:21:28,581 --> 00:21:29,401
[SPEAKER_02]: But I thought that was kind of fun.

289
00:21:29,981 --> 00:21:31,902
[SPEAKER_02]: So, take it or leave it.

290
00:21:31,922 --> 00:21:32,202
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.

291
00:21:32,912 --> 00:21:34,593
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

292
00:21:49,778 --> 00:21:50,399
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

293
00:22:08,357 --> 00:22:10,578
[SPEAKER_02]: and the main rundown of stuff that happened in the week.

294
00:22:10,618 --> 00:22:13,098
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure you read gaming blogs, you listen to other shows.

295
00:22:13,538 --> 00:22:18,080
[SPEAKER_02]: We want to expand a little more on having roundtable discussions on a limited scope of stories.

296
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:21,461
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't worry, we'll bring you the quick news too, close to the end of the show.

297
00:22:21,781 --> 00:22:30,363
[SPEAKER_02]: But we're going to try focusing on, in our Part A and Part B, just like maybe six stories each segment that can get a little more discussion.

298
00:22:30,683 --> 00:22:35,325
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you want to call in at any point during the show to add to the discussion, you can always give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR

299
00:22:37,205 --> 00:22:39,347
[SPEAKER_02]: or, of course, you can always send us emails and so forth.

300
00:22:40,008 --> 00:22:43,612
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, our chat room, chat.orangelonsradio.com is always available there as well.

301
00:22:44,052 --> 00:22:47,936
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, of course, we're going to spend a little more time in studio talking about these different topics.

302
00:22:48,137 --> 00:22:49,958
[SPEAKER_02]: So let us know your feedback.

303
00:22:50,079 --> 00:22:55,344
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, as always, mailbag at orangelonsradio.com or our Twitter, twitter.com slash OLR or...

304
00:22:56,865 --> 00:23:00,447
[SPEAKER_02]: The Facebook group, the OL Army, which we haven't really done anything with for a while.

305
00:23:00,467 --> 00:23:00,927
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to.

306
00:23:01,447 --> 00:23:03,428
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, so we're just going to open it up.

307
00:23:03,768 --> 00:23:07,149
[SPEAKER_02]: Less stories, more time on each story is basically what it boils down to.

308
00:23:07,550 --> 00:23:10,491
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's see what happens.

309
00:23:10,691 --> 00:23:13,172
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'll start off tonight with a news story.

310
00:23:14,312 --> 00:23:17,134
[SPEAKER_02]: That kind of confirms something we heard about a while ago.

311
00:23:17,154 --> 00:23:23,179
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a trademark about this a little while ago that spurred this whole debate I think we've had once before on the show.

312
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:24,541
[SPEAKER_02]: But it was confirmed.

313
00:23:25,001 --> 00:23:29,425
[SPEAKER_02]: Nintendo will be launching a help feature inside of their games.

314
00:23:29,745 --> 00:23:32,387
[SPEAKER_02]: This story comes from USA Today's Game Hunter blog.

315
00:23:32,688 --> 00:23:33,828
[SPEAKER_02]: Game Hunter's blog, sorry.

316
00:23:34,229 --> 00:23:37,992
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's talking about how Miyamoto has essentially confirmed that

317
00:23:38,012 --> 00:23:39,113
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

318
00:23:58,910 --> 00:24:01,492
[SPEAKER_02]: Nintendo's Whole Thing in the First Place

319
00:24:22,046 --> 00:24:31,828
[SPEAKER_02]: Moving on with the story, Shigeru Miyamoto did say in the interview that there's going to be this demo play, is what they're calling it, the tentative name of this, the demo play.

320
00:24:32,489 --> 00:24:35,689
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's the quote from the article, quote, In New Super Mario Bros.

321
00:24:35,749 --> 00:24:42,171
[SPEAKER_02]: Wii, if a player is experiencing an area of difficulty, this will allow them to clear troubled areas and take over when they're ready.

322
00:24:42,671 --> 00:24:45,332
[SPEAKER_02]: And yes, we're looking into this for future games, too.

323
00:24:46,492 --> 00:24:48,333
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the easy button.

324
00:24:48,593 --> 00:24:52,174
[SPEAKER_02]: Like in the Staples commercials, you hit the button and easy, you get your way through it.

325
00:24:52,754 --> 00:24:54,335
[SPEAKER_02]: Good thing, bad thing, Loki.

326
00:24:54,815 --> 00:25:00,477
[SPEAKER_03]: As I mentioned earlier, I know it's wrong to say this, but this is completely gay.

327
00:25:00,997 --> 00:25:05,398
[SPEAKER_03]: And the reason why... It does make me want to sleep with games of the same gender.

328
00:25:05,578 --> 00:25:05,898
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.

329
00:25:05,918 --> 00:25:06,218
[SPEAKER_03]: It does.

330
00:25:06,518 --> 00:25:07,899
[SPEAKER_03]: But, no, it's...

331
00:25:09,378 --> 00:25:16,381
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, I guess it's alright if they want to put this option in to other games like Zelda or something like that.

332
00:25:16,541 --> 00:25:17,261
[SPEAKER_03]: That makes sense.

333
00:25:17,681 --> 00:25:21,743
[SPEAKER_03]: Because you're playing it demo-wise, you can learn more of the story and stuff.

334
00:25:22,283 --> 00:25:23,183
[SPEAKER_03]: New Super Mario Bros.

335
00:25:23,223 --> 00:25:26,224
[SPEAKER_03]: for the Wii, I can't imagine that has a story at all.

336
00:25:26,465 --> 00:25:31,827
[SPEAKER_03]: So, really, you're basically taking away the only element of the game, which is playing it.

337
00:25:32,267 --> 00:25:34,788
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, I don't know.

338
00:25:34,948 --> 00:25:35,228
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean...

339
00:25:36,505 --> 00:25:44,568
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't imagine these games being that difficult, and the fact is that you can actually just autopilot the whole thing seems kind of retarded to me.

340
00:25:45,028 --> 00:25:56,692
[SPEAKER_03]: And also, in the same way, people are defending it, saying, well, this will allow you to be able to make the games more hardcore, more difficult for those that want it, and those that can't handle it, well, they can push the easy button.

341
00:25:57,412 --> 00:26:00,153
[SPEAKER_03]: But at the same time, why can't they just balance it?

342
00:26:00,973 --> 00:26:07,315
[SPEAKER_03]: Put the effort into balancing the game so that you have it for the easy players and for the more experienced players.

343
00:26:07,935 --> 00:26:09,256
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I know, like, you know, effort.

344
00:26:10,376 --> 00:26:12,257
[SPEAKER_03]: No, let's just autopilot the whole thing.

345
00:26:12,297 --> 00:26:13,097
[SPEAKER_03]: That's even better.

346
00:26:13,537 --> 00:26:14,958
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, but what about the argument?

347
00:26:14,978 --> 00:26:18,459
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is the first thing I think of, too, and I see AlphaCananagram going to it in chat.

348
00:26:18,679 --> 00:26:19,239
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't use it.

349
00:26:19,659 --> 00:26:20,199
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't like it?

350
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:20,880
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't use it.

351
00:26:21,340 --> 00:26:22,060
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't care.

352
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:24,321
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just insulting that it's there in the first place.

353
00:26:25,447 --> 00:26:30,529
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, because really, the message that comes across with that is not that, oh, we're trying to help players.

354
00:26:30,809 --> 00:26:38,433
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, maybe like Devil May Cry or something like that, or a game that's been notably insanely hard all the time.

355
00:26:39,013 --> 00:26:44,055
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe something like an easy mode for that or something, but not necessarily something that just plays the game for yourself.

356
00:26:46,371 --> 00:27:03,134
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, I just, I think the option, the better option should be something more approachable as far as like an easier, you know, gameplay option or something like that, an easier difficulty so that those people, you know, you can take those portions of the game that are going to be frustrating out of it or make them easier on this new difficulty.

357
00:27:04,195 --> 00:27:07,655
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm supposed to give you a slap on the wrist for calling it gay, by the way, from the chatters.

358
00:27:08,195 --> 00:27:09,096
[SPEAKER_02]: Whatever, you know.

359
00:27:10,076 --> 00:27:11,076
[SPEAKER_02]: Obviously he doesn't mean...

360
00:27:11,764 --> 00:27:11,864
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

361
00:27:11,904 --> 00:27:11,964
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

362
00:27:37,372 --> 00:27:40,154
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not even really entirely Nintendo's fault.

363
00:27:40,734 --> 00:27:46,738
[SPEAKER_03]: I put blame on society for this too because nowadays it's not about winning and losing.

364
00:27:46,818 --> 00:27:50,480
[SPEAKER_03]: It's about everybody participating and everybody's a winner because they've participated.

365
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:53,762
[SPEAKER_03]: That's great, except you're not participating.

366
00:27:53,822 --> 00:27:56,523
[SPEAKER_03]: You're just pushing a button and the game's doing it all for yourself.

367
00:27:56,863 --> 00:28:00,886
[SPEAKER_03]: So now that you've seen the end of the game, what's really going to entice you to go through it?

368
00:28:01,166 --> 00:28:02,266
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, on your own.

369
00:28:02,667 --> 00:28:03,027
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not...

370
00:28:03,795 --> 00:28:09,343
[SPEAKER_03]: And it really just, you know, sends home the message that Nintendo doesn't really give a crap about the core game.

371
00:28:09,383 --> 00:28:17,775
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, they do in a certain sense, but at the same time, it really, their console is for the younger audience and, well, we're making a few games for you as well.

372
00:28:18,344 --> 00:28:24,850
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me read some comments from chat, and if you have a thought on this too, give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR Is this making games too easy?

373
00:28:24,930 --> 00:28:25,610
[SPEAKER_02]: What's going on?

374
00:28:26,091 --> 00:28:38,380
[SPEAKER_02]: Some other comments from chat here, and this is one I agree with, is that GoldAnthro in chat says You will have the temptation to use it, that's the problem And for me, that might make me a little nervous too, but let's go to the phones, we have a call Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?

375
00:28:41,083 --> 00:28:42,544
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello, you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?

376
00:28:46,269 --> 00:28:50,313
[SPEAKER_02]: And wouldn't you know, the first call we take, it doesn't work.

377
00:28:50,573 --> 00:28:51,614
[SPEAKER_03]: Didn't use the easy button.

378
00:28:52,014 --> 00:28:52,474
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.

379
00:28:52,494 --> 00:28:53,896
[SPEAKER_02]: Your call needs to be automated.

380
00:28:53,916 --> 00:28:55,737
[SPEAKER_02]: Can I please pause the show and hit the button?

381
00:28:56,138 --> 00:28:56,578
[SPEAKER_02]: No, all right.

382
00:28:57,779 --> 00:28:58,159
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's the thing.

383
00:28:58,299 --> 00:29:04,204
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm also surprised that this was not launched in the Zelda type of game.

384
00:29:04,405 --> 00:29:05,966
[SPEAKER_02]: And I kind of get it for that.

385
00:29:06,506 --> 00:29:09,429
[SPEAKER_02]: But I kind of agree with what GameGuru was saying in chat.

386
00:29:09,489 --> 00:29:10,530
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a Super Mario Bros.

387
00:29:10,570 --> 00:29:10,730
[SPEAKER_02]: game.

388
00:29:10,770 --> 00:29:12,512
[SPEAKER_02]: If you can't play, you may as well give up gaming.

389
00:29:13,322 --> 00:29:15,026
[SPEAKER_02]: GoldAnthro Is this making games too easy?

390
00:29:24,628 --> 00:29:29,710
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it is, because people say don't use it if you don't want to.

391
00:29:31,030 --> 00:29:32,470
[SPEAKER_08]: If you don't want to use it, don't use it.

392
00:29:33,011 --> 00:29:42,533
[SPEAKER_08]: But there's that temptation that people will use it, because it is there.

393
00:29:43,513 --> 00:29:45,314
[SPEAKER_08]: If there's no reward for not using it...

394
00:29:47,085 --> 00:29:49,226
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sorry, I got my family yelling at me.

395
00:29:49,626 --> 00:29:50,206
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what I mean.

396
00:29:50,226 --> 00:29:51,586
[SPEAKER_08]: There's going to be that temptation.

397
00:29:52,126 --> 00:29:52,667
[SPEAKER_02]: No, that's okay.

398
00:29:53,887 --> 00:29:56,148
[SPEAKER_02]: That's kind of where I feel, too, is that it gives that temptation.

399
00:29:56,188 --> 00:29:57,868
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm trying to look at both sides of this.

400
00:29:57,908 --> 00:29:58,888
[SPEAKER_02]: I really am.

401
00:29:58,928 --> 00:30:04,890
[SPEAKER_02]: The Wii is that family-friendly, even your... I'm going to let you go, Goldanthro, but thanks for the feedback.

402
00:30:05,650 --> 00:30:06,491
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that very...

403
00:30:08,806 --> 00:30:13,809
[SPEAKER_02]: Wii's got that very family-friendly, soccer mom, let the seven-year-old play, image to preserve.

404
00:30:14,929 --> 00:30:17,991
[SPEAKER_02]: A feature like this kind of makes sense for a system like that.

405
00:30:18,632 --> 00:30:19,452
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think it does.

406
00:30:23,094 --> 00:30:31,339
[SPEAKER_03]: The problem with Nintendo and a lot of the game publishers and a lot of the companies out there that are producing consoles is this.

407
00:30:32,330 --> 00:30:43,352
[SPEAKER_03]: They're making the consoles and the games more approachable to people that don't play games, but people are still not biting on them, and so they're like, why are they not?

408
00:30:43,712 --> 00:30:44,492
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me take another call.

409
00:30:44,532 --> 00:30:45,532
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

410
00:30:45,572 --> 00:30:45,952
[SPEAKER_02]: Who's this?

411
00:30:46,953 --> 00:30:47,733
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, it's Sterlok.

412
00:30:47,893 --> 00:30:48,553
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, Sterlok.

413
00:30:48,853 --> 00:30:52,474
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you think about this whole Nintendo easy mode, or what they're calling it, demo mode?

414
00:30:52,534 --> 00:30:53,794
[SPEAKER_02]: Is this a good idea, bad idea?

415
00:30:55,354 --> 00:30:56,294
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's a great idea.

416
00:30:58,015 --> 00:30:59,315
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm blind, and...

417
00:31:01,109 --> 00:31:15,403
[SPEAKER_04]: This would be awesome for something like Zelda because I just like to walk around and just dick around and if I want to get further, it's really easy to just turn this thing on and

418
00:31:17,825 --> 00:31:19,466
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's a great idea.

419
00:31:20,706 --> 00:31:25,987
[SPEAKER_02]: You're saying that you're blind and that you have problems with certain other games.

420
00:31:26,007 --> 00:31:29,468
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you find Zelda to be too hard the way it is now?

421
00:31:30,408 --> 00:31:34,750
[SPEAKER_02]: You probably learned to deal with that as you're playing with the video games, right?

422
00:31:35,810 --> 00:31:39,371
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, since I'm totally blind, I just play with sound.

423
00:31:39,591 --> 00:31:39,771
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.

424
00:31:40,649 --> 00:31:43,872
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you the same one that sent us emails before on some of these subjects?

425
00:31:43,912 --> 00:31:43,972
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

426
00:31:43,992 --> 00:31:44,872
[SPEAKER_02]: About some of the music games?

427
00:31:44,912 --> 00:31:45,733
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, yeah, I remember you.

428
00:31:46,294 --> 00:31:50,277
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess here's kind of my thought.

429
00:31:50,497 --> 00:31:57,503
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a very good thing I wouldn't have thought of before, is that maybe it makes some of these games more handicap accessible, certainly, if there's something that's a little too difficult.

430
00:31:57,923 --> 00:32:02,386
[SPEAKER_02]: But, I mean, you've kind of come all this time gaming with that.

431
00:32:02,607 --> 00:32:05,109
[SPEAKER_02]: So why now for this?

432
00:32:06,782 --> 00:32:10,624
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, the main thing for me is progressing in the game itself.

433
00:32:10,825 --> 00:32:14,227
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the big thing for me why I think this is such a good idea.

434
00:32:14,247 --> 00:32:24,755
[SPEAKER_04]: If I want to get further in these games other than just walking around and just doing a bunch of nothing, I would have to get someone else to basically do it for me.

435
00:32:25,356 --> 00:32:30,259
[SPEAKER_02]: Sterlok, have you had games, a lot of games, where you hit that brick wall?

436
00:32:32,701 --> 00:32:33,682
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, because that's

437
00:32:34,571 --> 00:32:52,759
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm big into RPGs, so basically I'm sort of restricted to just walking around and fighting around the bells, which I like, but if I want to progress in the story, not a whole lot I can do about that.

438
00:32:53,880 --> 00:33:00,963
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, Sterluck, I really appreciate the insight and giving us another angle we may not have thought of otherwise, so thank you very much, Sterluck, and you have a good one.

439
00:33:01,423 --> 00:33:01,643
[SPEAKER_02]: You too.

440
00:33:03,376 --> 00:33:04,756
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely something I wouldn't have thought of before.

441
00:33:05,117 --> 00:33:09,118
[SPEAKER_02]: What about folks who might have something where they can't?

442
00:33:09,758 --> 00:33:15,900
[SPEAKER_02]: But maybe this speaks to a greater thing about making games more handicap accessible to begin with, and maybe this just isn't the way to do it.

443
00:33:15,980 --> 00:33:16,340
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

444
00:33:17,060 --> 00:33:19,221
[SPEAKER_03]: Then that's the case in How Noble of Nintendo.

445
00:33:19,501 --> 00:33:21,202
[SPEAKER_03]: However, I don't think that's why they're doing it.

446
00:33:22,102 --> 00:33:22,582
[SPEAKER_02]: I would agree.

447
00:33:23,282 --> 00:33:27,364
[SPEAKER_02]: It comes down to their... It's a perk for folks, but it's not the reason.

448
00:33:27,464 --> 00:33:27,964
[SPEAKER_03]: It's okay.

449
00:33:28,004 --> 00:33:29,244
[SPEAKER_03]: We've made the games easier.

450
00:33:29,264 --> 00:33:31,945
[SPEAKER_03]: We've made the system that's more approachable for gamers...

451
00:33:32,165 --> 00:33:32,785
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

452
00:33:52,332 --> 00:34:15,907
[SPEAKER_03]: in case they get stuck that's great but you know what getting that knowledge of that feature out there to a consumer that's not playing games I mean I'm pretty sure they're probably not up to date on everything that's coming into you know a certain game they're probably not gonna know about it anyways and it's really just a kind of a waste of time because I don't think it's really going to accomplish what they're hoping that it will accomplish

453
00:34:16,155 --> 00:34:18,957
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me read a few more things from chat and then we'll move on with some more stories tonight.

454
00:34:19,017 --> 00:34:20,859
[SPEAKER_02]: But I wanted to read some of these comments.

455
00:34:21,499 --> 00:34:26,883
[SPEAKER_02]: Azure Edge in chat says, I thought all of this was just when you pause, a movie comes up showing you how to do it.

456
00:34:27,143 --> 00:34:29,305
[SPEAKER_02]: But when you resume the game, you start off where you were at.

457
00:34:29,525 --> 00:34:31,627
[SPEAKER_02]: And perhaps that was in the original trademark.

458
00:34:32,047 --> 00:34:33,448
[SPEAKER_03]: I would have no problems with that.

459
00:34:33,508 --> 00:34:34,069
[SPEAKER_03]: That's fine.

460
00:34:34,129 --> 00:34:38,272
[SPEAKER_03]: If they're giving you tips on how to play the game, then yeah, that seems very fair.

461
00:34:38,292 --> 00:34:42,255
[SPEAKER_03]: Because that way they're helping you along, but you actually have to do it.

462
00:34:42,415 --> 00:34:43,336
[SPEAKER_03]: And I do encourage that.

463
00:34:43,456 --> 00:34:44,456
[SPEAKER_02]: This is Spazinator.

464
00:34:44,516 --> 00:34:44,957
[SPEAKER_02]: A bad idea.

465
00:34:45,097 --> 00:34:46,437
[SPEAKER_02]: For a couple of reasons.

466
00:35:11,337 --> 00:35:22,967
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, first being, although Nintendo's not coming out and directly seeing it, they're kind of implying that gamers are stupid.

467
00:35:24,068 --> 00:35:30,153
[SPEAKER_06]: They have to handle gamers to get them to finish the game.

468
00:35:31,174 --> 00:35:35,878
[SPEAKER_06]: And you've got to remember, at least back in the original NES days,

469
00:35:37,734 --> 00:35:40,336
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, a lot of people take, uh,

470
00:36:03,550 --> 00:36:09,376
[SPEAKER_06]: pride in the fact that they play these really difficult games and end up beating them.

471
00:36:10,056 --> 00:36:17,764
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, for me, I feel that if a game is too easy, you tend to lose interest in it.

472
00:36:18,678 --> 00:36:20,219
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much, Spazinator, for the input.

473
00:36:20,239 --> 00:36:22,661
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to talk about this a little bit, but I'm going to go ahead and let you go for now.

474
00:36:23,262 --> 00:36:24,303
[SPEAKER_02]: We move on to other topics.

475
00:36:26,565 --> 00:36:33,190
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of what Spazinator is saying, he kind of compares to the older games, and a lot of people are very fond of those games.

476
00:36:33,531 --> 00:36:39,015
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think when I think about this easy mode, yeah, it's making games more accessible to seven-year-olds and ten-year-olds.

477
00:36:39,296 --> 00:36:44,100
[SPEAKER_02]: But then I think back, okay, well, when I was ten years old, I was busting my way through Kid Icarus, which was one of the hardest games ever.

478
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:44,961
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

479
00:37:03,294 --> 00:37:20,472
[SPEAKER_03]: The games out here now, if you're going to put out a lot of games that you're trying to make accessible for a 7 year old and they're really super duper easy, yeah, you may get them interested in playing games and they may think that they're all awesome because they're able to finish these games, but at the same time, is that really making the 7 year old a better gamer?

480
00:37:20,672 --> 00:37:23,515
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, later on down the line, are they going to be any better, you know,

481
00:37:24,065 --> 00:37:24,565
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

482
00:37:46,711 --> 00:37:48,973
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, one more chat comment, then we'll move on to the next story.

483
00:37:49,273 --> 00:37:52,716
[SPEAKER_02]: Deekman in chat says, Also, I would probably use it when playing Zelda.

484
00:37:53,057 --> 00:37:56,359
[SPEAKER_02]: I love the series and the plot of the games, but just can't seem to focus.

485
00:37:56,720 --> 00:38:01,704
[SPEAKER_02]: But if I can progress quickly without breaking the flow of the story, then please hook me up.

486
00:38:02,264 --> 00:38:06,448
[SPEAKER_02]: This could be an interesting perspective, and this is, you know, again...

487
00:38:07,508 --> 00:38:10,210
[SPEAKER_02]: Where I almost support this feature in games like Zelda.

488
00:38:10,230 --> 00:38:14,212
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure how I feel about it in like a Mario game, but an adventure game like Zelda.

489
00:38:14,792 --> 00:38:16,313
[SPEAKER_02]: Jury's still out for me on this whole thing.

490
00:38:16,513 --> 00:38:17,434
[SPEAKER_02]: I can be swayed either way.

491
00:38:17,474 --> 00:38:18,374
[SPEAKER_02]: I need to see it in action.

492
00:38:18,694 --> 00:38:20,475
[SPEAKER_02]: But for the Zelda games, I kind of sympathize.

493
00:38:20,875 --> 00:38:26,278
[SPEAKER_02]: I am such a short attention span gamer sometimes that sometimes I don't want the challenge.

494
00:38:26,739 --> 00:38:27,879
[SPEAKER_02]: I want that story.

495
00:38:28,279 --> 00:38:29,700
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to watch the whole thing unfold.

496
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:35,583
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you know how many games sit on my shelf that I haven't beat because I quickly move from one game to the next?

497
00:38:36,064 --> 00:38:36,244
[SPEAKER_02]: Like...

498
00:38:36,744 --> 00:38:37,104
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

499
00:38:37,144 --> 00:38:40,165
[SPEAKER_02]: I wish there almost sometimes there was a way I could just go back and finish them all.

500
00:38:40,905 --> 00:38:41,345
[SPEAKER_02]: But I don't know.

501
00:38:41,425 --> 00:38:43,526
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's great, but I don't think New Super Mario Bros.

502
00:38:43,746 --> 00:38:44,746
[SPEAKER_03]: has a story.

503
00:38:44,886 --> 00:38:46,046
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm pretty sure it doesn't.

504
00:38:46,386 --> 00:38:47,587
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's really no point.

505
00:38:48,127 --> 00:38:55,449
[SPEAKER_03]: And on top of that, stop trying to develop technology to demo actual games and give us stupid demos for God's sake.

506
00:38:55,809 --> 00:38:56,229
[SPEAKER_03]: Seriously.

507
00:38:57,321 --> 00:38:57,761
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

508
00:39:18,871 --> 00:39:19,411
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for watching!

509
00:39:39,324 --> 00:40:08,515
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want to do another maze I want to get to a save point I want to go eat a burger because that's just where I was at that point so you know what I loaded up Final Fantasy Wikia and there was a whole little map on how to get through that room and I just did it and I was like yay that's fine that's okay but see you're not relying on I mean to get you through a certain point and it's just helping you out it's not saying okay you know you need to do this or you know here let me do this for you it's just saying you know here's what you need to do go do it

510
00:40:09,460 --> 00:40:09,660
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

511
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:10,080
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's fine.

512
00:40:10,120 --> 00:40:14,042
[SPEAKER_03]: That's just like saying, you know, hey, Rob, I'm stuck in the Zelda game.

513
00:40:14,122 --> 00:40:15,342
[SPEAKER_03]: You've gotten past this point.

514
00:40:15,702 --> 00:40:16,603
[SPEAKER_03]: What am I supposed to do?

515
00:40:17,223 --> 00:40:21,064
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just like that, and there's no harm in that because you're still having to do it.

516
00:40:21,304 --> 00:40:22,325
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just giving you a tip.

517
00:40:22,625 --> 00:40:26,787
[SPEAKER_02]: How often do you – I know, like, many years ago, like in high school and stuff, how often did you do that?

518
00:40:26,807 --> 00:40:27,827
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, your friend would be playing the game.

519
00:40:27,867 --> 00:40:28,767
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't get past this part.

520
00:40:28,807 --> 00:40:29,387
[SPEAKER_02]: Give me the controller.

521
00:40:29,407 --> 00:40:30,148
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, there you go.

522
00:40:30,168 --> 00:40:30,488
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.

523
00:40:30,548 --> 00:40:33,489
[SPEAKER_03]: Why isn't Nintendo just bringing back the Nintendo tip line?

524
00:40:33,549 --> 00:40:35,290
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, they can make more money that way.

525
00:40:35,370 --> 00:40:36,810
[SPEAKER_02]: Get some game counselors on staff.

526
00:40:36,830 --> 00:40:37,310
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.

527
00:40:37,330 --> 00:40:37,631
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

528
00:40:37,651 --> 00:40:38,551
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's move on with some more news.

529
00:40:38,982 --> 00:40:42,744
[SPEAKER_03]: DJ Hero Turntable Support for Future Guitar Hero Games

530
00:41:08,965 --> 00:41:14,029
[SPEAKER_03]: So maybe later on, you know, they can add DJ support as well.

531
00:41:15,069 --> 00:41:18,092
[SPEAKER_03]: They said they would have liked to have worked it into Guitar Hero 5.

532
00:41:18,432 --> 00:41:21,474
[SPEAKER_03]: Unfortunately, Guitar Hero 5 ships in a few months.

533
00:41:22,295 --> 00:41:26,337
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, it's a few months before the DJ Hero thing comes out.

534
00:41:27,018 --> 00:41:29,440
[SPEAKER_03]: So maybe later on they'll add it in there.

535
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:31,501
[SPEAKER_03]: But it sounds like a great idea.

536
00:41:31,521 --> 00:41:32,542
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

537
00:41:34,190 --> 00:41:36,191
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think it's a great idea.

538
00:41:36,291 --> 00:41:40,174
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think they're going to do it, but it sounds like a cool idea.

539
00:41:40,254 --> 00:41:47,058
[SPEAKER_03]: I think if anything, if they're going to have that type of stuff, it's just going to be maybe tracks that you can download on DJ Hero.

540
00:41:47,078 --> 00:41:49,980
[SPEAKER_03]: They'll have the guitar and DJ Element in there.

541
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:55,225
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you have an opinion on this or any other story we're going through tonight, 1-877-GAME-OLR is the number to call.

542
00:41:55,325 --> 00:41:57,647
[SPEAKER_02]: Or our chat room is chat.orangeloungeradio.com.

543
00:41:58,107 --> 00:42:01,250
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, this makes me think about I was playing rock band this weekend.

544
00:42:01,270 --> 00:42:01,951
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you were over.

545
00:42:02,011 --> 00:42:03,352
[SPEAKER_02]: We were checking out rock band.

546
00:42:03,793 --> 00:42:11,560
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, I don't have room for a turntable on top of all the other crap that rock band, you know, rock band, guitar hero, whatever.

547
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:12,821
[SPEAKER_02]: Same thing these days, right?

548
00:42:13,121 --> 00:42:14,242
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, not really.

549
00:42:14,282 --> 00:42:15,784
[SPEAKER_02]: But same peripherals these days, right?

550
00:42:15,804 --> 00:42:15,924
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

551
00:42:16,104 --> 00:42:16,684
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

552
00:42:36,701 --> 00:42:38,202
[SPEAKER_02]: DJ Hero Mixing Music Together

553
00:43:03,334 --> 00:43:03,834
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

554
00:43:20,694 --> 00:43:28,437
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, it'd be a lot of support for a game that they could just add more support to the existing DJ games to just get people to buy that instead.

555
00:43:28,457 --> 00:43:31,178
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's no real point to have to support it anyway.

556
00:43:31,258 --> 00:43:33,879
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I still say you're going to be so limited with this, though.

557
00:43:33,939 --> 00:43:41,562
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I don't... Okay, on my Rock Band, I have Rock Band 2, Rock Band 1, and I've got to have at least 40 to 50 download songs.

558
00:43:41,682 --> 00:43:43,763
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I have a lot of download songs.

559
00:43:44,143 --> 00:43:46,444
[SPEAKER_02]: I've given that company a lot of money, but they've earned it.

560
00:43:46,584 --> 00:43:48,225
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, a lot of fun nights there with Rock Band.

561
00:43:49,585 --> 00:43:59,649
[SPEAKER_02]: I, sometimes, you know, when I have friends come over to play the game, they get up ready to sing, they scroll through the list and scroll and scroll and scroll and go, I can't really sing any of these songs.

562
00:43:59,910 --> 00:44:08,133
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like there's, sometimes, and I don't know how you guys do it when you play rock band, but I know that we let the singer always pick the song because they probably get the hardest role.

563
00:44:08,553 --> 00:44:17,157
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, guitar is pretty much the same and drums are pretty much the same and I assume turntable would be pretty much the same no matter what song you're choosing, but it's always up to the vocalist.

564
00:44:17,577 --> 00:44:24,201
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, how much variety are you going to get if there's only like 10 songs that are going to support the turntable and all this?

565
00:44:24,581 --> 00:44:30,004
[SPEAKER_02]: It seems like, while it's a nice enhancement, it seems like effort that could be better spent somewhere else.

566
00:44:30,024 --> 00:44:33,126
[SPEAKER_03]: And the only thing I could see, here would be a good idea.

567
00:44:33,767 --> 00:44:36,928
[SPEAKER_03]: You would take like a game, I don't think Guitar Hero is the right game for it.

568
00:44:36,968 --> 00:44:44,493
[SPEAKER_03]: I think Band Hero would be the right game for it because Band Hero is going to be more pop music that has a lot more turntable stuff in it.

569
00:44:45,202 --> 00:44:46,982
[SPEAKER_02]: Wait, there's actually a separate game called Band Hero?

570
00:44:47,022 --> 00:44:47,542
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, there is.

571
00:44:47,682 --> 00:44:51,223
[SPEAKER_03]: It's basically like Lego Rock Band, because Lego Rock Band's going to be more pop music.

572
00:44:51,463 --> 00:44:54,384
[SPEAKER_03]: They had a demo, or they had a trailer for it at E3.

573
00:44:55,084 --> 00:44:56,384
[SPEAKER_02]: I know, I remember seeing that trailer.

574
00:44:56,484 --> 00:44:58,425
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought... I don't know why.

575
00:44:58,465 --> 00:45:00,185
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, call me stupid, laugh at me, I don't care.

576
00:45:00,545 --> 00:45:03,266
[SPEAKER_02]: But I thought that was kind of like Guitar Hero 5's name.

577
00:45:03,386 --> 00:45:04,326
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought it was the same thing.

578
00:45:04,706 --> 00:45:10,867
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought they were just finally admitting, oh, hey, Guitar Hero's not really a guitar game anymore, so they're calling it Band... I thought it was Guitar Hero 5 Band.

579
00:45:11,067 --> 00:45:17,973
[SPEAKER_03]: Band Hero now is basically the pop, easy, family-friendly game or whatever.

580
00:45:18,494 --> 00:45:20,515
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're going to have bundles and fun stuff for that.

581
00:45:20,856 --> 00:45:28,723
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think that would be more appropriate for Band Hero because then you could, say, have a download thing that adds DJ support in if you have DJ Hero.

582
00:45:28,983 --> 00:45:30,384
[SPEAKER_03]: Or, hey, if you want to...

583
00:45:31,545 --> 00:45:32,946
[SPEAKER_03]: Be interesting with it, I guess.

584
00:45:33,147 --> 00:45:42,354
[SPEAKER_03]: And since they don't really sell the instruments by themselves at the turntables, maybe if you have a DJ Hero save file or something like that, it detects it and it'll allow you to play those games.

585
00:45:42,775 --> 00:45:53,064
[SPEAKER_03]: Or maybe if you have, say, songs available, like download content or something that's Guitar Hero and DJs that you can play in Band Hero.

586
00:45:53,404 --> 00:45:54,165
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me go to the phones.

587
00:45:54,185 --> 00:45:56,106
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a call here on our Skype line.

588
00:45:56,166 --> 00:45:57,347
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, you're on Orange Sounds Radio.

589
00:45:57,367 --> 00:45:57,768
[SPEAKER_02]: Who's this?

590
00:45:58,578 --> 00:45:59,499
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, it's Dan Shadow.

591
00:45:59,639 --> 00:46:00,379
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, Dan Shadow.

592
00:46:00,399 --> 00:46:05,043
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you think of this whole thing, the turntables in Guitar Hero and Band Hero and all this?

593
00:46:06,564 --> 00:46:09,827
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I wasn't really what I called, but I just wanted to try.

594
00:46:10,487 --> 00:46:18,333
[SPEAKER_00]: Isn't it the new Guitar Hero game, or was it Rock Band, Beatles, that lets you play multiple instruments in replacement of other instruments?

595
00:46:18,554 --> 00:46:19,594
[SPEAKER_03]: That's Guitar Hero 5.

596
00:46:20,735 --> 00:46:26,800
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, because you just mentioned the lead singer always rolls through whatever song they want and then

597
00:46:27,523 --> 00:46:33,512
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, like bass, and then no one wants to sing, and that's the, I just think good thing.

598
00:46:35,549 --> 00:46:38,131
[SPEAKER_02]: The call is cutting in a little in and out.

599
00:46:38,151 --> 00:46:49,541
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we have the bad connection, but I kind of get the point there that Guitar Hero 5 is kind of letting us do this more enhanced band thing where if nobody wants to sing, then great, we'll have two people play guitar.

600
00:46:49,961 --> 00:46:51,082
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, that's more peripherals.

601
00:46:51,602 --> 00:46:54,244
[SPEAKER_02]: But hey, at this point, you probably have enough.

602
00:46:54,264 --> 00:46:55,726
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, tons of people own them at this point.

603
00:46:55,746 --> 00:46:58,488
[SPEAKER_02]: You probably have enough, and hell, friends bring them over.

604
00:46:58,528 --> 00:47:00,109
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess that's probably not going to be the problem.

605
00:47:00,529 --> 00:47:03,452
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't see four drummers, but sure, why not?

606
00:47:04,187 --> 00:47:11,619
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I just wanted to chime in and say that's the biggest problem I have when I play rock band is that everyone wants to play one song, the singer doesn't want to play this song or whatever.

607
00:47:12,440 --> 00:47:14,684
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's what I wanted to chime in on.

608
00:47:14,724 --> 00:47:15,085
[SPEAKER_00]: Go ahead and

609
00:47:15,629 --> 00:47:18,170
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep on with your DJ conversation.

610
00:47:18,270 --> 00:47:19,910
[SPEAKER_02]: No worries.

611
00:47:20,010 --> 00:47:21,851
[SPEAKER_02]: We are experimenting with a new format tonight.

612
00:47:21,891 --> 00:47:24,552
[SPEAKER_02]: Letting the callers call in while we are talking about stories.

613
00:47:24,952 --> 00:47:28,613
[SPEAKER_02]: It's perfectly okay if folks want to go back a few steps within the story.

614
00:47:28,653 --> 00:47:31,914
[SPEAKER_02]: As long as somebody doesn't call in to say, Hey, I want to talk about Doom.

615
00:47:33,914 --> 00:47:37,015
[SPEAKER_02]: We will have a space at the end of the show for folks that want to call in on any topic.

616
00:47:38,335 --> 00:47:39,196
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much, Dan.

617
00:47:39,396 --> 00:47:39,796
[SPEAKER_02]: Have a good night.

618
00:47:40,636 --> 00:47:41,136
[SPEAKER_02]: Have a good one guys.

619
00:48:09,608 --> 00:48:10,389
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

620
00:48:33,874 --> 00:48:35,175
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, TigerClaw in our chat.

621
00:48:35,235 --> 00:48:37,697
[SPEAKER_02]: Chat.OrangeLaunchRadio.com is saying quite a bit about this.

622
00:48:38,417 --> 00:48:48,363
[SPEAKER_02]: Very curious about what the Armin Van Buren DJ game is going to be like, which was oddly silent at E3, as was Scratch, although now we're starting to see videos of Scratch be released this week and more.

623
00:48:48,644 --> 00:48:49,604
[SPEAKER_02]: I've already seen them.

624
00:48:49,944 --> 00:48:50,545
[SPEAKER_02]: Very interesting.

625
00:48:50,905 --> 00:48:52,607
[SPEAKER_02]: I think a violin in a music game would be awesome.

626
00:49:12,985 --> 00:49:16,926
[SPEAKER_02]: But when I read that, isn't that more going the other way?

627
00:49:17,226 --> 00:49:20,527
[SPEAKER_02]: Putting guitars in DJ Hero, which they're already talking about doing?

628
00:49:20,707 --> 00:49:22,547
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, and they are.

629
00:49:23,488 --> 00:49:26,468
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's a cool idea as well, but it's kind of the other way.

630
00:49:26,548 --> 00:49:29,849
[SPEAKER_02]: It's putting guitars in DJ Hero because you're saying you're adding guitars.

631
00:49:31,209 --> 00:49:34,850
[SPEAKER_02]: But, to be fair, a very interesting line that's being blurred.

632
00:49:35,050 --> 00:49:37,591
[SPEAKER_02]: Would it be interesting if some of these songs were in both tracks?

633
00:49:38,359 --> 00:49:38,840
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?

634
00:49:56,914 --> 00:50:00,976
[SPEAKER_03]: Not something I think they're going to do this time around, but it will be cool in the future.

635
00:50:01,277 --> 00:50:07,040
[SPEAKER_03]: And I mean, sure, we're spending $120 on this game and a controller, so I'd hope I'd be able to use it in as many things as possible.

636
00:50:07,821 --> 00:50:11,463
[SPEAKER_02]: We have the TimeDilationDude in chat says, again, we need more cowbell.

637
00:50:12,023 --> 00:50:12,403
[SPEAKER_02]: That's true.

638
00:50:12,423 --> 00:50:14,044
[SPEAKER_02]: When are we just going to get cowbell in these games?

639
00:50:14,064 --> 00:50:14,845
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what we're waiting for.

640
00:50:14,885 --> 00:50:18,647
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't they have that like in... Wii Music has cowbell.

641
00:50:18,667 --> 00:50:22,169
[SPEAKER_03]: No, well, cowbell and that, but like in rock bands and stuff like that where you can play the cymbals.

642
00:50:22,469 --> 00:50:23,030
[SPEAKER_02]: Tambourine.

643
00:50:23,090 --> 00:50:23,770
[SPEAKER_02]: It's tambourine.

644
00:50:24,050 --> 00:50:25,351
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes it's a cowbell noise.

645
00:50:25,831 --> 00:50:26,032
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

646
00:50:26,152 --> 00:50:26,312
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

647
00:50:27,653 --> 00:50:32,116
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, they should actually have Cowl Kay Lefster in our chatroom asks, is DJ Hero really going to work?

648
00:50:32,576 --> 00:50:53,111
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I mean, it looks... I think it's going to be fun I think it's going to be a fun game too, and it looks a lot of fun from the previews I already got my order in Yeah, I mean, good thing because... I'll get them both I'm all about Rock Band When it comes down to Rock Band versus Guitar Hero, right now I am totally in the Rock Band camp I think it's the superior game But, good thing for Activision, I'm highly interested by DJ Hero I think it could be a good thing

649
00:50:53,511 --> 00:51:16,268
[SPEAKER_02]: and that has nothing to do with my prior obsession about Beatmania 2DX if you're still saying wait for the reviews when the reviews come in on this game if you see reviewers comparing DJ Hero to Beatmania 2DX they are morons the games look completely different unless granted they quantify it with what makes them very different because the games are very different

650
00:51:16,548 --> 00:51:20,639
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want a game that's like beat me in 2DX, you're going to play Scratch.

651
00:51:21,361 --> 00:51:23,246
[SPEAKER_03]: It's 2DX with better scratching.

652
00:51:23,366 --> 00:51:24,189
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all it really is.

653
00:51:25,427 --> 00:51:26,308
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the kind of thing.

654
00:51:26,368 --> 00:51:36,015
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to play both because DJ Hero is more about mixing music together, which I like doing, and Scratch is more about scratching.

655
00:51:36,155 --> 00:51:45,081
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really got the ability to do different techniques and stuff in there and really kind of make the songs your own instead of just kind of following note charts and stuff like that.

656
00:51:45,101 --> 00:51:45,221
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

657
00:51:46,727 --> 00:51:51,129
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, in the end, Scratch is basically 2DX with better scratching.

658
00:51:51,549 --> 00:51:54,430
[SPEAKER_02]: And DJ Dark Knight in chat says, G4 will, just you watch.

659
00:51:54,490 --> 00:51:55,130
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I have no doubt.

660
00:51:55,190 --> 00:51:57,131
[SPEAKER_02]: That's especially who I'm targeting that statement as.

661
00:51:57,471 --> 00:52:11,776
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you're the person that writes the reviews that Morgan and Adam or whatever their names are read on Xplay, do not make that mistake like they did when they reviewed Beatmania on the PlayStation 2 a couple years ago saying it ripped off Guitar Hero.

662
00:52:13,237 --> 00:52:14,397
[SPEAKER_02]: Beatmania's been around since 1997?

663
00:52:18,288 --> 00:52:20,510
[SPEAKER_02]: Guitar Hero has been around since 2005 or 2005.

664
00:52:40,789 --> 00:52:43,591
[SPEAKER_03]: Just because she's a pretty face to look at.

665
00:52:44,552 --> 00:52:46,453
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember, G4 is not a gaming network.

666
00:52:46,814 --> 00:52:47,414
[SPEAKER_02]: Not anymore.

667
00:52:47,474 --> 00:52:49,976
[SPEAKER_02]: They haven't been for quite some time.

668
00:52:50,456 --> 00:52:55,080
[SPEAKER_02]: They are a network that caters to boys that have some gaming-related shows.

669
00:52:55,260 --> 00:52:58,002
[SPEAKER_03]: They make a big presence at E3.

670
00:52:58,042 --> 00:53:02,646
[SPEAKER_03]: They have their booth and they run around and act goofy.

671
00:53:02,686 --> 00:53:06,428
[SPEAKER_03]: Sadly enough, I think Spike covers games better than G4.

672
00:53:06,448 --> 00:53:06,669
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

673
00:53:07,429 --> 00:53:10,292
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, because Spike is for big boys and G4 is for little boys.

674
00:53:10,532 --> 00:53:12,394
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not the way it's supposed to break down.

675
00:53:12,454 --> 00:53:15,476
[SPEAKER_02]: And boys who like reality TV, like cops and cheaters.

676
00:53:15,557 --> 00:53:17,338
[SPEAKER_02]: Not little boys, but you know what I mean?

677
00:53:17,398 --> 00:53:20,501
[SPEAKER_02]: It's more for the teen and 21-ish audience.

678
00:53:20,541 --> 00:53:21,022
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?

679
00:53:21,782 --> 00:53:24,385
[SPEAKER_02]: It's G4 is for frat dudes.

680
00:53:24,825 --> 00:53:25,826
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what G4 is for.

681
00:53:25,846 --> 00:53:27,748
[SPEAKER_03]: G4 doesn't really know what kind of a network it is.

682
00:53:27,788 --> 00:53:31,251
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just experimenting to see what sticks is really what it is.

683
00:53:31,451 --> 00:53:33,654
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, Deakman says the E3 coverage is pretty good.

684
00:53:33,934 --> 00:53:37,058
[SPEAKER_02]: And I do know people that will watch G4's E3 coverage.

685
00:53:37,339 --> 00:53:42,265
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and to be fair, they are like the only network that's making a 24-7 practically presence at E3.

686
00:53:42,665 --> 00:53:49,194
[SPEAKER_02]: So I would actually almost agree they probably do cover E3 better than anyone because they devote so much time to it, you know?

687
00:53:53,420 --> 00:53:55,561
[SPEAKER_02]: Xenocor in chat wants to clarify something, by the way.

688
00:53:55,601 --> 00:53:56,362
[SPEAKER_02]: It's Olivia Munn.

689
00:53:56,422 --> 00:53:58,863
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know how we got on the G4 tangent, but it needs to stop.

690
00:53:58,964 --> 00:54:00,004
[SPEAKER_02]: No, that's all right.

691
00:54:00,024 --> 00:54:00,905
[SPEAKER_02]: There's one last comment.

692
00:54:01,225 --> 00:54:04,548
[SPEAKER_02]: Xenocor in chat says, it's Olivia Munn, and she's not posing nude.

693
00:54:04,628 --> 00:54:07,650
[SPEAKER_02]: Half the otaku geeks in the world are going to experience nerd rage.

694
00:54:09,079 --> 00:54:12,462
[SPEAKER_02]: Guitar Hero Van Halen Guitar Hero Van Halen Guitar Hero Van Halen

695
00:54:31,095 --> 00:54:38,818
[SPEAKER_02]: The thing about Guitar Hero Van Halen is just that when I watch it, and you could watch it at E3 if you knew where to look, at Sony's booth as opposed to Activision's.

696
00:54:39,438 --> 00:54:44,820
[SPEAKER_02]: When you watch it, you can hear the cash cow mooing when you're watching the game.

697
00:54:44,840 --> 00:54:47,241
[SPEAKER_03]: It's re-skinned Guitar Hero Metallica, that's all it is.

698
00:54:47,421 --> 00:54:49,342
[SPEAKER_02]: and some more stories about this game

699
00:55:18,222 --> 00:55:18,522
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

700
00:55:18,542 --> 00:55:21,644
[SPEAKER_02]: They had some decent songs with the other lead singers.

701
00:55:21,964 --> 00:55:27,068
[SPEAKER_02]: It kind of also makes you go, okay, well, how long was David Lee Roth really with them?

702
00:55:27,589 --> 00:55:30,311
[SPEAKER_02]: So where are they going to get all their songs from?

703
00:55:30,851 --> 00:55:40,238
[SPEAKER_02]: And sure enough, if you start to kind of look at the song list, while if you were a fan of Van Halen back in the 80s and David Lee Roth was around...

704
00:55:40,938 --> 00:55:41,739
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to be happy.

705
00:55:43,680 --> 00:55:48,602
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of room for those that have been following Van Halen later on.

706
00:55:49,102 --> 00:55:50,203
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the game could improve.

707
00:55:51,043 --> 00:55:54,425
[SPEAKER_02]: And yes, this is Marissa in chat says, It's Van Halen, not Van Hagar.

708
00:55:55,245 --> 00:56:00,448
[SPEAKER_02]: And that, by the way, is exactly what Activision was quoted saying at one point.

709
00:56:00,488 --> 00:56:02,229
[SPEAKER_02]: It's definitely Van Halen and not Van Hagar.

710
00:56:04,570 --> 00:56:05,090
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.

711
00:56:06,431 --> 00:56:07,391
[SPEAKER_02]: But I got to be honest.

712
00:56:07,431 --> 00:56:08,652
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, I'm just... I'm not...

713
00:56:09,591 --> 00:56:11,293
[SPEAKER_02]: Really interesting guitar hero, Van Halen.

714
00:56:11,613 --> 00:56:14,776
[SPEAKER_02]: If I was a hardcore Van Halen fan, I'd be all over this game.

715
00:56:15,316 --> 00:56:22,883
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, just like, I don't expect probably any of our listeners bought SingStar ABBA, but I did, because I like ABBA, and I'm not ashamed to admit it.

716
00:56:24,985 --> 00:56:28,448
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm probably, you know, again, SingStar ABBA probably, what was it?

717
00:56:28,788 --> 00:56:31,570
[SPEAKER_02]: It was just really a 25-song expansion pack for SingStar.

718
00:56:31,590 --> 00:56:33,712
[SPEAKER_02]: There's not a damn thing new or special about it.

719
00:56:33,892 --> 00:56:34,433
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I want?

720
00:56:34,533 --> 00:56:35,474
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't even pretend.

721
00:56:36,286 --> 00:56:39,447
[SPEAKER_03]: I want Guitar Hero, Huey Lewis and the News.

722
00:56:42,268 --> 00:56:43,469
[SPEAKER_03]: That's some good music there.

723
00:56:44,269 --> 00:56:45,990
[SPEAKER_02]: How about Guitar Hero Rickroll Edition?

724
00:56:46,010 --> 00:56:48,431
[SPEAKER_02]: There's really only one song to play in it.

725
00:56:48,791 --> 00:56:49,911
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what we're moments away from becoming.

726
00:56:49,931 --> 00:56:52,212
[SPEAKER_03]: Guitar Hero Kenny Loggins would be pretty cool too.

727
00:56:52,232 --> 00:56:54,213
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

728
00:56:54,453 --> 00:56:54,713
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

729
00:56:55,509 --> 00:56:56,390
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, there you go.

730
00:56:58,732 --> 00:57:01,094
[SPEAKER_02]: Guitar Hero Van Halen is not a game I'm very interested in.

731
00:57:01,154 --> 00:57:04,437
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd just settle for some download content with those artists.

732
00:57:04,497 --> 00:57:05,558
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, that would be fine.

733
00:57:06,199 --> 00:57:08,300
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's another thing, too, with Guitar Hero.

734
00:57:08,461 --> 00:57:14,946
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I'm glad that they put out download content I think about every week.

735
00:57:15,447 --> 00:57:16,228
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not really sure.

736
00:57:16,888 --> 00:57:20,812
[SPEAKER_03]: But a lot of these things could easily just be...

737
00:57:22,495 --> 00:57:22,955
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

738
00:57:48,120 --> 00:57:49,802
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

739
00:58:10,740 --> 00:58:11,481
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, you know.

740
00:58:11,521 --> 00:58:15,625
[SPEAKER_02]: As they said, and I, you know, this is probably even something we've covered on the show, but I'm just so out of it.

741
00:58:15,945 --> 00:58:19,048
[SPEAKER_02]: Lego Rock Band is independent of the, oh no, I remember this got brought up.

742
00:58:19,128 --> 00:58:21,570
[SPEAKER_02]: Lego Rock Band's list, you can't import it into the other games.

743
00:58:21,630 --> 00:58:22,451
[SPEAKER_02]: Nope, different publisher.

744
00:58:22,471 --> 00:58:24,373
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right, because all the, yeah, I remember this.

745
00:58:24,393 --> 00:58:25,354
[SPEAKER_02]: This came up last week.

746
00:58:26,755 --> 00:58:28,516
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if I'm really interested in Lego Rock Band.

747
00:58:28,636 --> 00:58:29,256
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think I am.

748
00:58:29,616 --> 00:58:30,397
[SPEAKER_02]: Beatles Rock Band?

749
00:58:30,457 --> 00:58:31,398
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm all over that shit.

750
00:58:31,618 --> 00:58:32,899
[SPEAKER_02]: That game looked amazing.

751
00:58:33,159 --> 00:58:34,920
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm not even a hardcore Beatles fan.

752
00:58:35,220 --> 00:58:37,762
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't even think I've ever owned a Beatles album.

753
00:58:38,682 --> 00:58:44,286
[SPEAKER_02]: Obviously, I think John Lennon was a great man, as were all the Beatles, and especially they do a lot of great humanitarian work now.

754
00:58:44,566 --> 00:58:49,109
[SPEAKER_02]: They have timeless classics, and you hear the songs, they're just so embedded in our culture.

755
00:58:49,569 --> 00:58:50,850
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't help but not know.

756
00:58:50,890 --> 00:58:54,933
[SPEAKER_02]: But the game just looked like, wow, this is not just a cheap reskinning.

757
00:58:55,473 --> 00:59:05,298
[SPEAKER_02]: Somebody really sat down at a table and thought, okay, how do we make... Like, not just how do we slap the Beatles in this game, but how do we make a game about the Beatles in this franchise?

758
00:59:05,639 --> 00:59:07,039
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what really kind of made that game special.

759
00:59:07,059 --> 00:59:07,520
[SPEAKER_03]: It's effort.

760
00:59:07,580 --> 00:59:08,560
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the level of effort.

761
00:59:08,620 --> 00:59:12,762
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not just, okay, we took out Metallica, put in Van Halen, done.

762
00:59:12,982 --> 00:59:16,244
[SPEAKER_02]: Whereas I think Lego Rock Band was, okay, let's just slap Legos in Rock Band.

763
00:59:16,524 --> 00:59:16,704
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

764
00:59:16,765 --> 00:59:17,545
[SPEAKER_02]: Make it a family-friendly franchise.

765
00:59:17,565 --> 00:59:21,907
[SPEAKER_03]: That is about as much effort as, you know, the guitar hero Van Halen.

766
00:59:21,947 --> 00:59:23,128
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, I'll give it to them because...

767
00:59:23,648 --> 00:59:24,629
[SPEAKER_03]: That's one game.

768
00:59:24,909 --> 00:59:39,655
[SPEAKER_03]: That's not like Guitar Hero Metallica, Guitar Hero Smash Hits, Guitar Hero Van Halen, Guitar Hero 5, Guitar Hero Band Hero, Guitar Hero Aerosmith, Guitar Hero for the DS, which just came out, On Tour 3, Guitar Hero, which will probably have an On Tour 4 by the time we get to November.

769
00:59:48,507 --> 00:59:50,227
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just, it's too much.

770
00:59:51,008 --> 00:59:52,268
[SPEAKER_03]: Too much in one year.

771
00:59:52,308 --> 00:59:54,248
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, God, space this stuff out.

772
00:59:54,408 --> 00:59:55,749
[SPEAKER_03]: Add it as download content.

773
00:59:56,049 --> 01:00:01,410
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for allowing the World Tour downloads to be available in Guitar Hero 5.

774
01:00:01,730 --> 01:00:10,592
[SPEAKER_03]: Unfortunately, you can't import the whole Guitar Hero World Tour song list into Guitar Hero 5 like you can with Rock Band 1 and Rock Band 2.

775
01:00:10,692 --> 01:00:11,612
[SPEAKER_03]: And assuming...

776
01:00:12,492 --> 01:00:19,457
[SPEAKER_03]: That all stays the same, Rock Band 3, which you just build one continuous big song list, which I think is a great idea.

777
01:00:19,477 --> 01:00:21,278
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think we'll get Rock Band 3 next year?

778
01:00:22,319 --> 01:00:22,699
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe.

779
01:00:22,940 --> 01:00:30,185
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we will get a Rock Band 3 because they're going to do three-part harmonies in Rock Band, and they may add some different stuff into it.

780
01:00:30,305 --> 01:00:30,685
[SPEAKER_03]: Who knows?

781
01:00:31,286 --> 01:00:32,707
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think there will be a new one next year.

782
01:00:32,767 --> 01:00:35,509
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm still hoping for a keyboard someday, but I know, fat chance.

783
01:00:36,308 --> 01:00:37,509
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

784
01:01:00,612 --> 01:01:02,574
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, now we're going to talk about hardware.

785
01:01:03,114 --> 01:01:11,020
[SPEAKER_03]: You've probably heard a lot of game companies touting that their game has maxed out the hardware, the PS3 or the Xbox 360.

786
01:01:11,380 --> 01:01:16,364
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, according to Richard Parr, who works at Criterion...

787
01:01:17,285 --> 01:01:20,747
[SPEAKER_03]: He's basically said the proof is that you're not the best.

788
01:01:22,008 --> 01:01:24,489
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically, it means that you're out of ideas.

789
01:01:24,549 --> 01:01:27,451
[SPEAKER_03]: You always find new ways to do things.

790
01:01:27,611 --> 01:01:32,975
[SPEAKER_03]: The constraints lift, not just with a new console generation, but with every game you do.

791
01:01:33,155 --> 01:01:33,875
[SPEAKER_03]: And I agree with him.

792
01:01:33,915 --> 01:01:40,399
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you look at games like Crysis that maxed out all the PCs out there, basically.

793
01:01:40,459 --> 01:01:42,961
[SPEAKER_03]: Just ridiculous stuff that you throw at it because...

794
01:01:43,921 --> 01:01:50,405
[SPEAKER_03]: You have three graphics cards in there, high-end processor, all the RAM you could possibly throw at it, and it runs just kind of good.

795
01:01:50,865 --> 01:01:52,366
[SPEAKER_03]: Not great, but good.

796
01:01:52,686 --> 01:01:53,246
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know why?

797
01:01:53,306 --> 01:01:55,988
[SPEAKER_03]: It's because they didn't optimize their code for shit.

798
01:01:56,388 --> 01:01:59,109
[SPEAKER_03]: And then when Crisis Wars comes out, oh, look at that!

799
01:01:59,189 --> 01:02:03,572
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the same damn game, basically, and it runs great on all these PCs.

800
01:02:03,692 --> 01:02:04,572
[SPEAKER_03]: Wonder why that was?

801
01:02:04,772 --> 01:02:07,253
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, it's because we actually optimized our code this time.

802
01:02:07,874 --> 01:02:11,956
[SPEAKER_03]: So really, I think that they are able to push out more, you know,

803
01:02:13,248 --> 01:02:23,216
[SPEAKER_03]: More code, just better detail, better processing power out of these games just by the effort and tricks that they learned along the way.

804
01:02:23,316 --> 01:02:32,223
[SPEAKER_03]: Learn to optimize their code, learn to optimize their engines that they run in, and just kind of figure out ways to use every bit of the console's power.

805
01:02:35,405 --> 01:02:43,352
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you know, it's interesting because it's challenging people to kind of, you know, think within the constraints that you might already have.

806
01:02:43,432 --> 01:02:45,654
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you've got to innovate with what you've already got.

807
01:02:45,954 --> 01:02:50,718
[SPEAKER_02]: It kind of makes me think about why do games still continue to come out for the Dreamcast and all this?

808
01:02:50,818 --> 01:02:50,998
[SPEAKER_02]: People

809
01:02:51,698 --> 01:02:53,940
[SPEAKER_03]: Because there's a big independence scene on Dreamcast.

810
01:02:53,980 --> 01:02:55,581
[SPEAKER_03]: Not necessarily because they're putting out better games.

811
01:02:55,881 --> 01:03:01,265
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think a better example would be looking at what we're seeing this year for the Wii.

812
01:03:01,325 --> 01:03:04,187
[SPEAKER_03]: Look at Red Steel 2.

813
01:03:04,847 --> 01:03:06,368
[SPEAKER_03]: Red Steel 2 looks awesome.

814
01:03:06,428 --> 01:03:08,469
[SPEAKER_03]: It runs at 60 frames per second.

815
01:03:08,790 --> 01:03:11,511
[SPEAKER_03]: The graphics are pretty great on it.

816
01:03:11,531 --> 01:03:15,454
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks like something that could probably be on a 360 or a PS3.

817
01:03:15,834 --> 01:03:17,055
[SPEAKER_03]: But they're doing it on the Wii.

818
01:03:17,235 --> 01:03:17,756
[SPEAKER_03]: And before...

819
01:03:19,578 --> 01:03:20,840
[SPEAKER_03]: No one thought that was possible.

820
01:03:20,940 --> 01:03:29,108
[SPEAKER_03]: Even with the Metroid other M, that looks like that could be easily on a 360 or something like that, at least from the videos I've seen.

821
01:03:29,949 --> 01:03:31,670
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of these other games look really good.

822
01:03:31,690 --> 01:03:35,034
[SPEAKER_03]: They're running at 60 frames per second and stuff like that on the Wii.

823
01:03:35,474 --> 01:03:39,258
[SPEAKER_03]: A big one that was, I want to say...

824
01:03:41,843 --> 01:03:46,088
[SPEAKER_03]: The Conduit is another one that pushed the engine really well on the Wii.

825
01:03:46,108 --> 01:03:47,589
[SPEAKER_03]: They said, oh yeah, we maxed it out.

826
01:03:47,630 --> 01:03:48,090
[SPEAKER_03]: But guess what?

827
01:03:48,110 --> 01:03:53,076
[SPEAKER_03]: They came out with some better games now, other games that are coming out after Conduit.

828
01:03:54,017 --> 01:03:54,157
[SPEAKER_03]: And...

829
01:03:54,821 --> 01:03:55,542
[SPEAKER_03]: They're even better.

830
01:03:55,802 --> 01:04:02,006
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you mentioning Metroid made me think of F-Zero on the GameCube, and I love F-Zero.

831
01:04:02,046 --> 01:04:07,370
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that was just an awesome game, especially that particular one that was on the GameCube, and it looked great.

832
01:04:07,430 --> 01:04:10,933
[SPEAKER_02]: And at the time, did something that was almost unheard of on the GameCube.

833
01:04:10,973 --> 01:04:16,557
[SPEAKER_02]: It supported widescreen 480 progression, the same resolution that the Wii does.

834
01:04:17,018 --> 01:04:21,521
[SPEAKER_02]: Yet, I see so many Wii games that don't look as good as F-Zero GX did.

835
01:04:21,561 --> 01:04:27,742
[SPEAKER_03]: PlayStation 2, there was Gran Turismo 4, it supported 1080i on the PlayStation 2.

836
01:04:28,623 --> 01:04:31,843
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you know... Wow, I didn't even realize that.

837
01:04:31,863 --> 01:04:37,425
[SPEAKER_03]: Who's to say that these consoles, who's to say that you couldn't develop a Wii game that could support those higher resolutions?

838
01:04:38,065 --> 01:04:38,905
[SPEAKER_03]: They could do it.

839
01:04:39,025 --> 01:04:41,946
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, hell, if a PlayStation 2 can do it, why can't the Wii?

840
01:04:42,006 --> 01:04:43,246
[SPEAKER_03]: It's got better specs in it.

841
01:04:43,326 --> 01:04:47,167
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, maybe, well, for one, the Wii has no HDMI, but I guess they do have that particular output.

842
01:04:47,187 --> 01:04:48,407
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't matter, they have component output.

843
01:04:48,667 --> 01:04:49,087
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.

844
01:04:49,127 --> 01:04:49,547
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

845
01:04:49,787 --> 01:04:51,428
[SPEAKER_03]: You could do 1080p over component.

846
01:04:52,068 --> 01:04:53,248
[SPEAKER_03]: Or just do 1080i.

847
01:04:53,268 --> 01:04:56,549
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know enough about the tech end to really know.

848
01:04:56,629 --> 01:04:58,689
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there something within the hardware that has to enable it?

849
01:04:58,909 --> 01:05:01,010
[SPEAKER_03]: It's memory bandwidth, basically.

850
01:05:01,050 --> 01:05:09,511
[SPEAKER_03]: You're limited to the video memory and the video processor for those consoles to be able to push out textures and stuff like that.

851
01:05:09,931 --> 01:05:11,572
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think maybe 720p?

852
01:05:11,672 --> 01:05:12,572
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe that's doable.

853
01:05:13,226 --> 01:05:22,409
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you want to call us on this topic about consoles pushing their limits, do they still have a ways to go or what have you, 1-877-GAME-OLR is the number to call or chat.orangeloungeradio.com.

854
01:05:22,469 --> 01:05:33,672
[SPEAKER_03]: Or you can do better resolution, like use 720p, but maybe letterboxes down some so that it's not using as much RAM maybe, just black...

855
01:05:34,516 --> 01:05:43,294
[SPEAKER_03]: Bars on top and bottom or something like that But maybe a hybrid resolution like 540p or something weird I don't know Maybe that's possible

856
01:05:44,145 --> 01:06:09,176
[SPEAKER_02]: TigerClaw in chat says you can do 1080p over component if the TV supports it most TV won't allow 1080p over component because it doesn't support HDCP that's fine but I mean let's just do 720p then for argument's sake I mean because 720 still looks great I mean and a lot of it's interesting because a lot of these you got to be careful too there's a lot of cheap HD TVs out there they're only capable of 720 they don't even do the 1080 at all but yeah 720 is still considered HD

857
01:06:12,159 --> 01:06:14,640
[SPEAKER_02]: What's to say you can't do 720 on the Wii?

858
01:06:16,020 --> 01:06:16,740
[SPEAKER_02]: It'd be interesting.

859
01:06:17,201 --> 01:06:19,201
[SPEAKER_03]: Really, it's just forward thinking.

860
01:06:19,901 --> 01:06:22,082
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think that they're going to do that because guess what?

861
01:06:22,122 --> 01:06:25,302
[SPEAKER_03]: They think that their audience doesn't care.

862
01:06:25,803 --> 01:06:31,044
[SPEAKER_03]: That's sad because they could do that and they could push the technology to maybe do that.

863
01:06:32,136 --> 01:06:37,097
[SPEAKER_02]: And here's, this one comment here is going to take this conversation in a different direction.

864
01:06:37,137 --> 01:06:37,558
[SPEAKER_02]: Watch this.

865
01:06:38,358 --> 01:06:41,199
[SPEAKER_02]: GameGuru in chat says, graphical power is overrated.

866
01:06:41,619 --> 01:06:44,099
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, Wii's new AV port has four connections that aren't used.

867
01:06:44,119 --> 01:06:46,900
[SPEAKER_02]: But go back to, graphical power is overrated.

868
01:06:48,221 --> 01:06:50,361
[SPEAKER_02]: Isn't that what this is really all about in a way though?

869
01:06:50,441 --> 01:06:50,641
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

870
01:06:50,921 --> 01:06:54,142
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that, do you really have to have the most cutting edge?

871
01:06:54,162 --> 01:06:57,323
[SPEAKER_02]: Do we even really need this talk about HD on the Wii and all this stuff?

872
01:06:57,883 --> 01:07:00,104
[SPEAKER_02]: Shouldn't we just have the fun game?

873
01:07:00,836 --> 01:07:03,837
[SPEAKER_03]: True, but that's also how they're getting around some of this stuff too.

874
01:07:03,957 --> 01:07:10,299
[SPEAKER_03]: Because you'll notice, like Mad World, full 3D game, ran pretty good, black and white.

875
01:07:11,119 --> 01:07:12,199
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the way they got around.

876
01:07:12,659 --> 01:07:16,801
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a different art style, so they didn't have to push the detail and stuff like that.

877
01:07:17,161 --> 01:07:21,282
[SPEAKER_03]: Red Steel 2, they're going with a comic book or maybe cel-shaded look to it.

878
01:07:21,922 --> 01:07:27,784
[SPEAKER_03]: Another way that they've gotten around having to have really detailed textures and stuff like that, you save on texture memory that way.

879
01:07:27,964 --> 01:07:28,725
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

880
01:07:51,738 --> 01:07:52,018
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura.com

881
01:08:04,926 --> 01:08:05,346
[SPEAKER_02]: Plants vs. Zombies

882
01:08:27,110 --> 01:08:28,431
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

883
01:08:54,138 --> 01:08:56,280
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm very interested in the story.

884
01:08:56,380 --> 01:09:03,124
[SPEAKER_02]: Now granted, a lot of this is because I love Final Fantasy 4 and I'm very nostalgic for it, so to have the story keep going is great.

885
01:09:03,565 --> 01:09:08,728
[SPEAKER_03]: It's great though, because I mean, think about it though, if you did that with the Wii, you could actually reuse assets.

886
01:09:08,808 --> 01:09:10,770
[SPEAKER_03]: You save development time right there.

887
01:09:11,370 --> 01:09:16,413
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you can reuse assets, you can create new things, but you can just, you know, build upon it.

888
01:09:16,433 --> 01:09:19,736
[SPEAKER_03]: Remember Samet, what was it, Metroid Zero or whatever?

889
01:09:20,276 --> 01:09:21,337
[SPEAKER_03]: Zero Mission, I believe?

890
01:09:22,196 --> 01:09:23,817
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, basically Super Metroid.

891
01:09:23,877 --> 01:09:26,998
[SPEAKER_03]: There are some differences in there, but then there is this whole after part.

892
01:09:27,339 --> 01:09:29,880
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to read this lengthy comment from Xenocore, because I think it's a good one.

893
01:09:30,300 --> 01:09:35,683
[SPEAKER_02]: As much as this guy may have a point, this quote has merit, but only as far as what the rest of the game is doing.

894
01:09:36,063 --> 01:09:41,286
[SPEAKER_02]: This console has been maxed, if you consider what else the console is doing while it's rendering graphics.

895
01:09:41,826 --> 01:09:48,710
[SPEAKER_02]: If a game isn't as intensive in driving AI or keeping objects in memory, fighters have more room for graphics than a simulation does.

896
01:09:49,250 --> 01:09:51,131
[SPEAKER_02]: Chat.orange.com if you want to comment.

897
01:09:51,511 --> 01:09:53,092
[SPEAKER_02]: or 1877 GameOLR.

898
01:09:53,392 --> 01:09:53,812
[SPEAKER_03]: That's true.

899
01:09:56,713 --> 01:09:57,634
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all how they use it.

900
01:09:58,334 --> 01:09:59,014
[SPEAKER_03]: All the different tricks.

901
01:09:59,134 --> 01:10:00,415
[SPEAKER_02]: I like this comment from Dan Shadow.

902
01:10:00,615 --> 01:10:02,756
[SPEAKER_02]: Who cares about graphics when Scribblenauts is coming?

903
01:10:05,637 --> 01:10:06,377
[SPEAKER_03]: That's true.

904
01:10:06,437 --> 01:10:07,678
[SPEAKER_03]: Scribblenauts is going to be awesome.

905
01:10:07,698 --> 01:10:09,279
[SPEAKER_03]: How are they going to do a sequel to that game?

906
01:10:09,439 --> 01:10:09,759
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

907
01:10:10,556 --> 01:10:16,300
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, make a game like that on Xbox or something where when you put in bacon, it's real bacon.

908
01:10:16,480 --> 01:10:19,162
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't look like cartoony bacon, but real bacon.

909
01:10:20,944 --> 01:10:21,564
[SPEAKER_03]: Wishful thinking?

910
01:10:22,665 --> 01:10:24,746
[SPEAKER_03]: Too bad they couldn't do like a fighting game like that.

911
01:10:25,447 --> 01:10:28,369
[SPEAKER_03]: Where you're just fighting and all of a sudden you just summon different things.

912
01:10:28,989 --> 01:10:29,589
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what, though?

913
01:10:29,729 --> 01:10:37,811
[SPEAKER_02]: I gotta admit, as much as the Scribblenauts demo made me teehee when I was watching it at E3, I do remain a little skeptical about how fun it's really gonna be.

914
01:10:37,891 --> 01:10:41,792
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, the longevity is what I remain skeptical about.

915
01:10:42,432 --> 01:10:47,693
[SPEAKER_02]: You gotta remember, folks, remember, go back in the archives of this show, back to 2006, I think?

916
01:10:50,994 --> 01:10:54,635
[SPEAKER_02]: I said, Nintendogs was the best thing I played at E3.

917
01:10:55,015 --> 01:10:57,136
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be the most amazing game when it comes out.

918
01:10:57,536 --> 01:10:59,297
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be awesome.

919
01:10:59,417 --> 01:11:01,878
[SPEAKER_02]: All these things you can do is just going to be amazing.

920
01:11:01,918 --> 01:11:03,618
[SPEAKER_02]: Nintendogs is going to blow away your fucking mind.

921
01:11:03,658 --> 01:11:07,460
[SPEAKER_02]: And then when the game came out, bored now, two hours in.

922
01:11:07,800 --> 01:11:10,001
[SPEAKER_02]: It was the type of game where I'd seen it all at E3.

923
01:11:11,462 --> 01:11:13,865
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't played Scribblenauts.

924
01:11:14,146 --> 01:11:15,207
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not saying knocking it.

925
01:11:15,267 --> 01:11:16,670
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just saying skeptical.

926
01:11:16,890 --> 01:11:18,072
[SPEAKER_02]: For me, Draw the Life.

927
01:11:18,292 --> 01:11:19,073
[SPEAKER_03]: Another perfect one.

928
01:11:19,274 --> 01:11:20,656
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I can draw my character?

929
01:11:20,676 --> 01:11:21,397
[SPEAKER_03]: That's awesome.

930
01:11:22,278 --> 01:11:24,221
[SPEAKER_03]: Did that and got bored.

931
01:11:25,430 --> 01:11:41,199
[SPEAKER_03]: same developer even but this I think will be fun if not just to show to your friends hey look at that Cthulhu just screwing around with that and hey why not they should have a game that's just like a sandbox type thing where you can just create your own scenarios do whatever

932
01:11:42,649 --> 01:11:46,494
[SPEAKER_02]: Bandit in our chatroom asks, why is the Wii $99 for God's sake?

933
01:11:46,874 --> 01:11:47,755
[SPEAKER_02]: Good question!

934
01:11:50,158 --> 01:11:53,461
[SPEAKER_02]: Or why isn't the Wii $99 for God's sake?

935
01:11:53,541 --> 01:11:55,724
[SPEAKER_03]: Because they want to make money off of every console.

936
01:11:56,516 --> 01:11:58,758
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, because people are still buying it when it's $250.

937
01:11:58,818 --> 01:12:00,499
[SPEAKER_02]: Why bother?

938
01:12:00,579 --> 01:12:04,441
[SPEAKER_03]: Because they think that they can, you know... I mean, look at that.

939
01:12:04,922 --> 01:12:07,664
[SPEAKER_03]: The Xbox 360 is $50 cheaper than them.

940
01:12:08,464 --> 01:12:09,064
[SPEAKER_03]: But you know what?

941
01:12:09,125 --> 01:12:15,709
[SPEAKER_03]: They're so arrogant, I guess, and confident in their system that they just say, eh, whatever.

942
01:12:15,889 --> 01:12:17,110
[SPEAKER_03]: We're not competing with anybody.

943
01:12:18,953 --> 01:12:20,435
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not part of the next gen.

944
01:12:20,515 --> 01:12:21,516
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember that quote?

945
01:12:21,596 --> 01:12:22,657
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not part of the next gen.

946
01:12:22,677 --> 01:12:23,638
[SPEAKER_02]: We're a different gen.

947
01:12:23,859 --> 01:12:27,082
[SPEAKER_02]: But no, it really comes down to because the game is still selling.

948
01:12:27,263 --> 01:12:28,104
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the reason why.

949
01:12:29,005 --> 01:12:30,406
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, let's move on.

950
01:12:30,947 --> 01:12:32,608
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a lot of ground to cover before we get to break here.

951
01:12:32,768 --> 01:12:40,135
[SPEAKER_02]: And this next story is about the Xbox 360's Project Natal, which obviously was one of the highly talked about things at E3 this year.

952
01:12:40,616 --> 01:12:47,161
[SPEAKER_02]: The rumor going around this week is that Xbox Natal might actually be the next Microsoft console.

953
01:12:48,042 --> 01:12:55,169
[SPEAKER_02]: It might not be something that you buy to enhance with your 360, but it might actually be a whole new type of console.

954
01:12:55,953 --> 01:12:59,355
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

955
01:13:16,545 --> 01:13:17,005
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

956
01:13:38,117 --> 01:13:38,637
[SPEAKER_02]: XBOX 360 SLIM

957
01:14:02,659 --> 01:14:03,279
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, what do you think?

958
01:14:03,560 --> 01:14:06,962
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it makes sense that they might redesign the console to be smaller.

959
01:14:06,982 --> 01:14:08,683
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think it's going to be the next console, though.

960
01:14:09,183 --> 01:14:12,665
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think they're going to increase the specs on it or anything, because they can't.

961
01:14:12,705 --> 01:14:16,347
[SPEAKER_03]: Because they would alienate half their audience, basically.

962
01:14:17,488 --> 01:14:22,511
[SPEAKER_03]: I do think that maybe later on, if this takes off like they think it's going to take off, then yeah, it probably will be bundled with...

963
01:14:23,932 --> 01:14:29,955
[SPEAKER_03]: All the Xbox 360 consoles as they come out will be just like a controller.

964
01:14:30,415 --> 01:14:38,379
[SPEAKER_03]: I think a lot of people are getting caught off guard with the whole we're going to treat the Natal launch like we're going to treat a console launch.

965
01:14:38,479 --> 01:14:40,600
[SPEAKER_03]: They're going to put a lot of marketing buzz behind it.

966
01:14:40,620 --> 01:14:51,866
[SPEAKER_03]: It kind of is a big thing because if it does exactly what it's showing that it's supposed to be able to do, then yeah, that is a big thing and that might get a lot of people interested and they really want to take away that market share advantage.

967
01:14:52,186 --> 01:14:59,152
[SPEAKER_03]: That the Wii has and maybe possibly capture some of these people that have never played games before because that's what kind of the Wii did.

968
01:14:59,232 --> 01:15:02,515
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, oh my god, I can play tennis like I can play tennis.

969
01:15:03,096 --> 01:15:05,097
[SPEAKER_03]: Or I can bowl like I can really bowl.

970
01:15:05,378 --> 01:15:08,820
[SPEAKER_03]: But this is like, I can bowl and I don't need the whole controller.

971
01:15:08,881 --> 01:15:10,282
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I don't even need to figure that out.

972
01:15:10,362 --> 01:15:11,603
[SPEAKER_03]: I just do it.

973
01:15:12,571 --> 01:15:16,094
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, now, here's something else to consider where they're going with this.

974
01:15:16,555 --> 01:15:18,456
[SPEAKER_02]: Why has the Wii been so successful?

975
01:15:18,496 --> 01:15:21,759
[SPEAKER_02]: Because they've been catering to the soccer moms, to the family audience.

976
01:15:22,260 --> 01:15:29,246
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, there are rumors out there, and I say believe them, that Nintendo's coming out with a new Wii in 2011, Wii HD.

977
01:15:29,306 --> 01:15:32,669
[SPEAKER_02]: There's rumors about behind closed doors, showing to companies, and so on.

978
01:15:32,709 --> 01:15:33,530
[SPEAKER_02]: And I say believe them.

979
01:15:34,051 --> 01:15:36,012
[SPEAKER_02]: Nintendo's the one that's got some catching up to do.

980
01:15:36,693 --> 01:15:37,534
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

981
01:16:03,375 --> 01:16:04,896
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's very interesting.

982
01:16:06,197 --> 01:16:10,741
[SPEAKER_02]: Obviously, Microsoft is not content with being number two or whatever they are right now.

983
01:16:10,761 --> 01:16:11,601
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess it's arguable.

984
01:16:11,661 --> 01:16:12,842
[SPEAKER_02]: You look at the world picture, whatever.

985
01:16:13,222 --> 01:16:13,863
[SPEAKER_02]: They're number two.

986
01:16:14,643 --> 01:16:15,824
[SPEAKER_02]: But they're not in America.

987
01:16:16,204 --> 01:16:16,565
[SPEAKER_02]: In the world.

988
01:16:16,945 --> 01:16:17,365
[SPEAKER_02]: Are they really?

989
01:16:17,445 --> 01:16:17,585
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

990
01:16:18,086 --> 01:16:19,307
[SPEAKER_02]: But like Japan, they're certainly not.

991
01:16:19,747 --> 01:16:21,868
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, yeah, but that doesn't matter.

992
01:16:21,928 --> 01:16:22,929
[SPEAKER_02]: Their market share is really small.

993
01:16:23,009 --> 01:16:24,110
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, well, whatever.

994
01:16:24,570 --> 01:16:26,592
[SPEAKER_02]: This isn't about 360 versus Sony right now.

995
01:16:26,632 --> 01:16:29,354
[SPEAKER_02]: This is about Microsoft wanting to be number one.

996
01:16:30,154 --> 01:16:49,320
[SPEAKER_02]: and they're looking at how did Nintendo do it and watch when this thing launches it's going to be launched at families again but it's going to be interesting because now they will still have that whole hardcore gamer whereas Wii is going to be going in reverse they'll already probably have the buy-in from the family audience they're going to need to get the hardcore gamers back on board

997
01:16:49,560 --> 01:16:53,902
[SPEAKER_03]: That's really going to be tough because I think Microsoft gets it though.

998
01:16:53,922 --> 01:16:56,404
[SPEAKER_03]: Because if you think about it, look at what they're showing off.

999
01:16:56,484 --> 01:17:00,906
[SPEAKER_03]: All the games that they're showing off really to their core audience that's already there.

1000
01:17:00,946 --> 01:17:06,790
[SPEAKER_03]: Games that everybody that I think owns the 360... For the most part, there's going to be something that you're going to be excited about.

1001
01:17:07,290 --> 01:17:11,952
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, Natal is really kind of just to gather those people that may be on the Wii and stuff.

1002
01:17:12,012 --> 01:17:16,495
[SPEAKER_03]: But the Wii, everybody that owns it... I mean, granted, there's games that you're looking forward to.

1003
01:17:16,795 --> 01:17:17,836
[SPEAKER_03]: But I know myself...

1004
01:17:19,315 --> 01:17:34,261
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not going to be, other than Metroid Other M, and that's kind of iffy on that one, I don't have faith in them that they're going to really put out something that's going to make me go, oh my god, this is so awesome, this is the greatest game I have ever played, type thing.

1005
01:17:34,761 --> 01:17:40,183
[SPEAKER_03]: I think they're just going to keep churning this crap that's been coming out year after year.

1006
01:17:41,638 --> 01:17:42,159
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

1007
01:17:58,922 --> 01:17:59,783
[SPEAKER_02]: GameGuru in chat says,

1008
01:18:13,939 --> 01:18:17,441
[SPEAKER_02]: But what I want to say to that is, who's to say where the generations are anymore?

1009
01:18:17,921 --> 01:18:28,706
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, what's interesting about what we've got with this current crop of systems is that they are entertainment devices in your living room, especially the 360 and especially PlayStation 3, especially, especially PlayStation 3.

1010
01:18:29,347 --> 01:18:36,470
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, their biggest thing right now is the fact that it's a Blu-ray player and does a lot of these, you know, things right out of the living room.

1011
01:18:36,911 --> 01:18:41,393
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, who's to say where the next generation is even going to begin?

1012
01:18:41,733 --> 01:18:42,954
[SPEAKER_02]: Because we have yet to really...

1013
01:18:44,054 --> 01:18:53,000
[SPEAKER_02]: Max out this generation in some ways, but I don't know if there's necessarily going to be a hard line that defines the next generation of gaming after this one.

1014
01:18:53,020 --> 01:18:59,224
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess this is what I'm getting at, because right now the war is about enhancing this current one, which we didn't really have before.

1015
01:18:59,605 --> 01:19:04,088
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, when you had a Super Nintendo, you might have the occasional peripheral to enhance it, but that's it.

1016
01:19:04,946 --> 01:19:05,606
[SPEAKER_03]: XBOX 360 XBOX 360 XBOX 360

1017
01:19:25,360 --> 01:19:42,501
[SPEAKER_03]: The possibilities with these new platforms So you're going to see stuff like the motion controllers Coming out from Sony and from Microsoft And you're going to see the enhancements to the console from the Wii Because it's technically not a new system It's just an enhancement like the DS and the DSi and the DS Lite

1018
01:19:45,563 --> 01:19:51,768
[SPEAKER_02]: GameGuru says, admittedly, it might be the next generation with MotionPlus, Natal, and PSMote.

1019
01:19:52,108 --> 01:19:56,051
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm almost on board with you there, but change MotionPlus to Wii HD.

1020
01:19:57,131 --> 01:19:57,752
[SPEAKER_02]: And there you have it.

1021
01:19:57,852 --> 01:20:00,434
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why I do think Wii HD is out sooner than later.

1022
01:20:00,734 --> 01:20:01,655
[SPEAKER_02]: What is this all about?

1023
01:20:01,815 --> 01:20:02,836
[SPEAKER_02]: Leveling the playfield.

1024
01:20:03,896 --> 01:20:06,598
[SPEAKER_02]: Xbox, Sony will now have motion control.

1025
01:20:07,059 --> 01:20:08,900
[SPEAKER_02]: Wii will now have high definition.

1026
01:20:09,661 --> 01:20:10,141
[SPEAKER_02]: Now it's a war.

1027
01:20:12,835 --> 01:20:13,519
[SPEAKER_02]: Now it's a war.

1028
01:20:15,698 --> 01:20:21,921
[SPEAKER_02]: GameGuru also says in chat, and I'm sorry to keep quoting from the same person, but just a lot of thought-provoking comments, so props to you.

1029
01:20:22,822 --> 01:20:24,302
[SPEAKER_02]: However, a price drop is due by 2010.

1030
01:20:24,882 --> 01:20:27,524
[SPEAKER_02]: Natal will bomb with the Family Gamer.

1031
01:20:27,964 --> 01:20:29,405
[SPEAKER_02]: Xbox has its stereotype.

1032
01:20:29,725 --> 01:20:30,905
[SPEAKER_02]: I couldn't disagree more.

1033
01:20:31,306 --> 01:20:33,707
[SPEAKER_02]: Not necessarily that Natal will bomb with the Family Gamer.

1034
01:20:33,807 --> 01:20:34,327
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know yet.

1035
01:20:34,487 --> 01:20:36,988
[SPEAKER_02]: It's too early to see until we start really seeing the games.

1036
01:20:37,268 --> 01:20:41,010
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't base everything off the Milo demo and some of these limited things we saw.

1037
01:20:41,330 --> 01:20:44,332
[SPEAKER_02]: But Xbox having a stereotype to overcome, they can do it.

1038
01:20:44,932 --> 01:20:45,733
[SPEAKER_02]: Hell yeah, they can do it.

1039
01:20:46,033 --> 01:20:47,875
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm not trying to sound like a fanboy or anything.

1040
01:20:47,935 --> 01:20:49,516
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm saying, you go back.

1041
01:20:49,917 --> 01:20:54,241
[SPEAKER_02]: The nice thing about this show, being around for seven years, you go back to some of those older episodes.

1042
01:20:54,281 --> 01:20:56,162
[SPEAKER_02]: My God, did we make fun of the Xbox.

1043
01:20:56,703 --> 01:20:57,304
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my God.

1044
01:20:57,584 --> 01:20:58,565
[SPEAKER_02]: The Xbrick.

1045
01:20:58,965 --> 01:21:00,066
[SPEAKER_02]: What a fat system.

1046
01:21:00,106 --> 01:21:01,107
[SPEAKER_02]: What a useless system.

1047
01:21:01,147 --> 01:21:03,049
[SPEAKER_02]: There isn't a fucking game on it I want to play.

1048
01:21:03,309 --> 01:21:04,490
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a piece of shit.

1049
01:21:04,750 --> 01:21:06,132
[SPEAKER_02]: Who wants to buy this console?

1050
01:21:06,312 --> 01:21:07,773
[SPEAKER_02]: This is just a PC in a box.

1051
01:21:08,073 --> 01:21:09,735
[SPEAKER_02]: There's not a damn thing on this worth playing.

1052
01:21:09,755 --> 01:21:10,015
[SPEAKER_02]: These are

1053
01:21:10,896 --> 01:21:11,497
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for watching!

1054
01:21:28,425 --> 01:21:29,326
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1055
01:21:55,748 --> 01:21:56,528
[SPEAKER_03]: But see, that's the thing.

1056
01:21:58,389 --> 01:22:03,872
[SPEAKER_03]: Microsoft, they're really not going to have much to overcome because they've got something for everybody.

1057
01:22:03,912 --> 01:22:12,197
[SPEAKER_03]: They've got now these community games, like 1 vs. 100 and stuff like that, that's going to appeal to people that like watching game shows and stuff like that.

1058
01:22:12,597 --> 01:22:17,480
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, do you think maybe they might try marketing that to elderly people that like watching game shows?

1059
01:22:17,520 --> 01:22:19,681
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, now you can be on your favorite game show.

1060
01:22:20,201 --> 01:22:23,102
[SPEAKER_03]: Wheel of Fortune, oh my god, that's going to totally be one of you.

1061
01:22:23,222 --> 01:22:25,404
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not going to end with 1 vs. 100, by the way.

1062
01:22:25,444 --> 01:22:26,344
[SPEAKER_02]: And here's my prediction.

1063
01:22:26,464 --> 01:22:27,625
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm throwing this out here right now.

1064
01:22:28,345 --> 01:22:28,585
[SPEAKER_02]: XBOX GOLD

1065
01:22:57,117 --> 01:23:03,662
[SPEAKER_02]: Xbox has finally conned you into buying something like a membership to Pogo.com or one of those sites.

1066
01:23:04,143 --> 01:23:07,766
[SPEAKER_02]: You know where you play the online games for cash and prizes and stuff.

1067
01:23:08,306 --> 01:23:09,867
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's just the first one that popped in my mind.

1068
01:23:09,887 --> 01:23:11,328
[SPEAKER_02]: But there's tons of these sites out there.

1069
01:23:11,869 --> 01:23:13,650
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what the Xbox is going to be.

1070
01:23:15,272 --> 01:23:19,195
[SPEAKER_02]: And they won't take half the shit that a lot of the people say when they talk about those other sites.

1071
01:23:19,435 --> 01:23:19,775
[SPEAKER_02]: Watch.

1072
01:23:21,096 --> 01:23:21,436
[SPEAKER_02]: Watch.

1073
01:23:22,437 --> 01:23:24,259
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what's going to happen with Xbox Live Gold.

1074
01:23:25,174 --> 01:23:25,914
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know about that.

1075
01:23:27,415 --> 01:23:31,817
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a prediction, not a fact, but I could definitely see that happening.

1076
01:23:31,857 --> 01:23:38,960
[SPEAKER_03]: They've got a lot with their streaming and Netflix, the social networking stuff now.

1077
01:23:39,360 --> 01:23:44,563
[SPEAKER_03]: You have Xbox Live Arcade, the independent games now, the community games.

1078
01:23:45,503 --> 01:23:51,606
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, you know, Xbox Originals, you can download full games on there now, you can, you know, play your DVDs, all that stuff.

1079
01:23:51,906 --> 01:23:54,107
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's, you know, basically an entertainment console.

1080
01:23:54,367 --> 01:24:03,170
[SPEAKER_03]: Now you go to the Wii, and you can play games on it, you can send a message to your friends, that's about it.

1081
01:24:03,450 --> 01:24:09,093
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's really limited, I mean, you can play retro games and stuff like that, but it's really limited as far as...

1082
01:24:10,276 --> 01:24:11,519
[SPEAKER_03]: The Entertainment Value.

1083
01:24:11,539 --> 01:24:13,665
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's really just a gaming console.

1084
01:24:14,386 --> 01:24:17,233
[SPEAKER_03]: But, I mean, maybe this Wii HD will change all that.

1085
01:24:17,273 --> 01:24:19,760
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe they will hopefully fix their online network.

1086
01:24:20,305 --> 01:24:22,286
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, I've got to read a couple more chats, and then we've got to move on.

1087
01:24:22,346 --> 01:24:28,350
[SPEAKER_02]: Unfortunately, I think we're finding that when we allow ourselves to talk more about stories, we talk about them for like 20 minutes at a time.

1088
01:24:28,890 --> 01:24:31,852
[SPEAKER_02]: We're almost an hour and a half in, and we've still got mailbags slated for this segment.

1089
01:24:32,312 --> 01:24:37,055
[SPEAKER_02]: But I do want to read a couple more comments because there are great talk in chat.orange.com tonight.

1090
01:24:37,435 --> 01:24:37,716
[SPEAKER_02]: SSJ100Matt says,

1091
01:24:45,440 --> 01:24:46,261
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, wishful thinking.

1092
01:24:46,401 --> 01:24:47,242
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's hope you're right.

1093
01:24:47,482 --> 01:24:51,405
[SPEAKER_02]: But releasing the next new console isn't going to get the consumer to buy at this time.

1094
01:24:52,165 --> 01:24:56,869
[SPEAKER_02]: And then SSJ100Mac continues in response to when I said the real war is coming.

1095
01:24:56,929 --> 01:24:58,510
[SPEAKER_02]: He says, well, fuck their war.

1096
01:24:58,750 --> 01:25:01,312
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going to fund it unless they make it worth my while.

1097
01:25:02,013 --> 01:25:10,740
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's a very good retort is that these things are only as good as the games that are on it, as we've always said.

1098
01:25:11,650 --> 01:25:11,930
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura.com

1099
01:25:35,082 --> 01:25:39,828
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people are willing to pay top dollar for entertainment.

1100
01:25:39,889 --> 01:25:42,953
[SPEAKER_02]: Not to devalue what he's saying because I think the argument is still a valid one.

1101
01:25:43,433 --> 01:25:48,800
[SPEAKER_02]: You still have to convince me that it's worth it to upgrade to a Wii HD.

1102
01:25:48,960 --> 01:25:51,424
[SPEAKER_02]: The thing about Nintendo, you know what they've got in their back pocket?

1103
01:25:52,225 --> 01:26:11,413
[SPEAKER_02]: Mario, Zelda, Metroid, the characters you love that's what they're holding in their back pocket and people that will buy anything that says Nintendo and all they have to do is show hey look it's Link in HD boom instant fanboy boner in sales and myself being one of them I'm in line I think a lot of us will be

1104
01:26:13,089 --> 01:26:29,196
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's face it, Nintendo taught us at age 7 You love Mario, and you love Link, and you love these games And they will be with you forever I'm loving Mario a lot less lately though, I just have to say that I don't know Not buying that new Super Mario Bros.

1105
01:26:29,236 --> 01:26:36,820
[SPEAKER_02]: game, sorry I'm not in it now because I don't have the friends to play with on a regular basis I can't buy new Super Mario Bros.

1106
01:26:36,840 --> 01:26:41,882
[SPEAKER_03]: because I don't have enough friends That's what it boils down to So, yeah Um

1107
01:26:42,812 --> 01:26:49,861
[SPEAKER_03]: EA, apparently, they've drawn some attention from...

1108
01:26:52,031 --> 01:26:57,596
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess their protest, not even really a real protest, it's a fake protest.

1109
01:26:57,976 --> 01:27:00,559
[SPEAKER_03]: At E3, they had protesters out front.

1110
01:27:00,619 --> 01:27:01,139
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you see it?

1111
01:27:01,500 --> 01:27:02,160
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I saw it.

1112
01:27:02,461 --> 01:27:03,141
[SPEAKER_03]: I saw the protesters.

1113
01:27:03,161 --> 01:27:04,302
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you think it was real at first?

1114
01:27:04,362 --> 01:27:05,643
[SPEAKER_02]: Nope, not at all.

1115
01:27:06,664 --> 01:27:13,711
[SPEAKER_02]: I had a moment of hesitation because I was looking at it and I was walking by and I was thinking, you know, with the crazies in this state, I almost believe it.

1116
01:27:14,011 --> 01:27:15,612
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1117
01:27:33,663 --> 01:27:34,144
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1118
01:27:47,645 --> 01:27:52,167
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and in fact, that wasn't the only person who bought that hook, line, and sinker.

1119
01:27:53,028 --> 01:28:11,177
[SPEAKER_03]: Apparently, the bloggers at LA Times, who basically wrote that the protesters promoted a multimedia anti-game website, the EA reps, of course, later confirmed to the Associated Press that the whole affair was staged by a marketing agency.

1120
01:28:11,498 --> 01:28:15,680
[SPEAKER_03]: It says now, apparently, game politics, they're pointing out that the stunt has angered

1121
01:28:16,380 --> 01:28:18,202
[SPEAKER_03]: Many real Catholic bloggers.

1122
01:28:18,602 --> 01:28:32,673
[SPEAKER_03]: Margaret Cabaniss of Inside Catholic wrote, It's been clear for a while now that the entertainment industry views Christians on the whole as priggish, thin-skinned, fun killers.

1123
01:28:33,053 --> 01:28:37,056
[SPEAKER_03]: Has anybody at EA actually read The Inferno?

1124
01:28:39,839 --> 01:28:41,320
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry, but that's kind of funny.

1125
01:28:42,040 --> 01:28:44,662
[SPEAKER_03]: Another blogger, I guess, at Catholic Video Games wrote,

1126
01:28:45,791 --> 01:28:46,671
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for watching!

1127
01:29:08,857 --> 01:29:09,758
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1128
01:29:24,834 --> 01:29:29,017
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and yeah, I do have to laugh because I do see Catholics unfortunately that way.

1129
01:29:29,257 --> 01:29:31,018
[SPEAKER_03]: Being Catholic myself, I, yeah.

1130
01:29:31,298 --> 01:29:37,642
[SPEAKER_02]: And now I'm thinking back on the whole thing and I'm kind of like, oh my gosh, I was so stupid to even believe it for like a minute.

1131
01:29:37,902 --> 01:29:41,444
[SPEAKER_02]: Because like one of those people, I swear to God, was dressed in like the Puritan outfit.

1132
01:29:41,724 --> 01:29:48,108
[SPEAKER_02]: Like the fucking Salem witch trials, like out there, you know, in the fucking like churn in the butter outfit.

1133
01:29:48,448 --> 01:29:49,229
[SPEAKER_02]: Burn the witch!

1134
01:29:49,689 --> 01:29:50,649
[SPEAKER_02]: Burn the witch!

1135
01:29:50,669 --> 01:29:52,731
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you should know, we should... And I should, I...

1136
01:29:53,371 --> 01:30:11,532
[SPEAKER_02]: but here's what I ask you guys should you be mad that they did it or should you be mad that people believed it that it actually was happening for a minute because unfortunately with some of these other things that sometimes you hear about the way and I'm not talking about you know most people are pretty normal but that you know

1137
01:30:12,640 --> 01:30:12,700
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

1138
01:30:30,894 --> 01:31:00,314
[SPEAKER_03]: and you know at the same time I think this whole you know stunt it didn't really do anything other than draw attention to obviously the game which is what they're hoping that it would but it's not like the protest was oh my god there's so much full frontal nudity in this game it's unbelievable and the violence and sex is just crazy you know then people like oh I gotta play this game you know like I would have been like tell me more you know just but no it's just like oh there's the devil in this game really Dante's Inferno there's

1139
01:31:00,814 --> 01:31:02,156
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1140
01:31:17,796 --> 01:31:31,082
[SPEAKER_02]: I shouldn't even mention it because after what I just said, I wouldn't want to compare the two because there's these obvious loons that go out there and protest these funerals of people that have served for our country.

1141
01:31:31,442 --> 01:31:41,906
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not even going to say who they are because I don't want to give them attention, but they go out and protest these funerals of soldiers who died in the war saying, this is because we have fags in America.

1142
01:31:42,526 --> 01:31:43,187
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1143
01:32:04,525 --> 01:32:06,086
[SPEAKER_02]: Do we have anyone that wants to comment on this?

1144
01:32:06,106 --> 01:32:09,129
[SPEAKER_02]: 1-877-GAME-OLR Did you think it was real?

1145
01:32:09,409 --> 01:32:10,810
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you buy into this for a minute?

1146
01:32:11,090 --> 01:32:11,631
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to know.

1147
01:32:11,871 --> 01:32:13,753
[SPEAKER_02]: Or are you Catholic and pissed off?

1148
01:32:13,773 --> 01:32:19,297
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you not remember when we did a protest or we were kind of observing of a protest for Booth Babes back in 2006?

1149
01:32:20,938 --> 01:32:28,640
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was all just a That was all hoax too, and that got picked up by a lot of bloggers But nobody went to the outpost, because wasn't that Scott's outpost?

1150
01:32:28,740 --> 01:32:42,965
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes it was And nobody went Well that part of the plan failed, but it still got picked up I shouldn't say nobody, he had a decent crowd, but I think they were hoping for a little more Yes, part B of the plan, not exactly executed correctly, but the part A part

1151
01:32:44,085 --> 01:32:44,726
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1152
01:33:08,769 --> 01:33:11,410
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually found it hilarious because I went to Fanime not too long ago

1153
01:33:37,212 --> 01:33:39,453
[SPEAKER_05]: There were actually protesters protesting Fanime.

1154
01:33:39,473 --> 01:33:44,695
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not too sure because I was looking at them from a distance.

1155
01:33:44,735 --> 01:33:48,737
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess they were protesting against hentai and all that stuff, against the anime porn.

1156
01:34:03,376 --> 01:34:12,422
[SPEAKER_05]: But the really funny thing was they had a cosplayer who came as Jesus to the anime convention, and he just went out there, and it was just hilarious.

1157
01:34:13,062 --> 01:34:15,003
[SPEAKER_02]: There's always somebody that's got to push the buttons.

1158
01:34:15,063 --> 01:34:18,405
[SPEAKER_02]: Did the protesters respond to the man in the Jesus cosplay?

1159
01:34:19,526 --> 01:34:21,727
[SPEAKER_05]: They just ignored him.

1160
01:34:21,747 --> 01:34:27,451
[SPEAKER_05]: They had this other cosplayer who came out as Jesus, but as a raptor dinosaur.

1161
01:34:28,937 --> 01:34:31,678
[SPEAKER_02]: It's called 4chan The house of the internet Why can't they be at E3?

1162
01:34:57,048 --> 01:35:04,716
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, I wanted to respond to this real quick because yes, it is a little off topic, but I need to say something because obviously, you know, being gay myself, I have a whole lot to say on this.

1163
01:35:05,417 --> 01:35:14,126
[SPEAKER_02]: SJ100Matt says, you know, Rob, not to get off topic, but the same churches, private organizations are running the same hate ads on the radio in New York for anti-gay marriage legislation.

1164
01:35:14,807 --> 01:35:25,796
[SPEAKER_02]: So, again, this just goes back to the whole, that's why I believed it when you had the chick in the Puritan outfit there with the sign that says, you know, Dante's Inferno, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

1165
01:35:25,996 --> 01:35:43,549
[SPEAKER_02]: Because when I see these ads and I hear these hate speech and stuff like that on the radio about, you know, withholding people's rights, when it's in the goddamn Constitution on the 14th Amendment, no state shall pass a law that robs people of the pursuit to life, liberty, etc., etc.

1166
01:35:44,690 --> 01:36:12,508
[SPEAKER_02]: okay like when I see these ads that's what I hear in my head burn the witch burn them throw them in the river see if they float don't give them any rights it's it's it's the archaic way of thinking it's always something sorry if I'm getting a little too personal and political for you but deal you know this is you know my rights that are being affected here when have I ever shut up about that topic on the show all right anything else to say about the protests Loki

1167
01:36:13,488 --> 01:36:15,471
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, no, it was retarded looking.

1168
01:36:16,974 --> 01:36:22,322
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, the whole thing was a little silly, but I will admit, I believed it for like half a second.

1169
01:36:22,603 --> 01:36:23,123
[SPEAKER_02]: I really did.

1170
01:36:24,090 --> 01:36:25,531
[SPEAKER_02]: General Gradover

1171
01:36:51,624 --> 01:36:54,707
[SPEAKER_02]: sent us an email wanting us to check out their podcast.

1172
01:36:55,307 --> 01:36:56,949
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I haven't checked it out yet, sadly.

1173
01:36:56,989 --> 01:36:57,870
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm behind on the email.

1174
01:36:58,250 --> 01:37:00,152
[SPEAKER_02]: But none2k.com.

1175
01:37:00,192 --> 01:37:02,454
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm always one to support independent podcasters.

1176
01:37:02,494 --> 01:37:04,976
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope that wasn't a porn ad or something in disguise.

1177
01:37:04,996 --> 01:37:09,700
[SPEAKER_02]: Will somebody please check that website out and make sure it is a legitimate indie podcast for me?

1178
01:37:11,201 --> 01:37:12,342
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to read this email.

1179
01:37:12,422 --> 01:37:16,606
[SPEAKER_02]: This email comes to us from... I don't want to read the real name there.

1180
01:37:18,271 --> 01:37:19,932
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think there is a real name.

1181
01:37:20,092 --> 01:37:23,613
[SPEAKER_02]: I will say the email says Nutman, so we'll call this person Nutman.

1182
01:37:25,174 --> 01:37:27,915
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, can you please not yell so much?

1183
01:37:29,536 --> 01:37:30,096
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I can't.

1184
01:37:30,636 --> 01:37:37,899
[SPEAKER_02]: I had to turn down the volume almost ten times in episode 326 because Loki was yelling so loudly it was hurting my ears.

1185
01:37:38,059 --> 01:37:39,540
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't be alone in this, right?

1186
01:37:40,200 --> 01:37:40,520
[SPEAKER_02]: P.S.

1187
01:37:40,660 --> 01:37:42,141
[SPEAKER_02]: OLR is awesome, as is Loki.

1188
01:37:43,188 --> 01:37:44,749
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess you just need to turn it down a little bit, Loki.

1189
01:37:44,969 --> 01:37:45,670
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you know, we try.

1190
01:37:46,010 --> 01:37:47,892
[SPEAKER_02]: This could be a problem that we've moved studios.

1191
01:37:48,232 --> 01:37:50,113
[SPEAKER_02]: We unhook and hook up the mics every week.

1192
01:37:50,454 --> 01:37:54,797
[SPEAKER_02]: We do rely on the live listeners to tell us if things sound way too crazy.

1193
01:37:55,177 --> 01:37:58,240
[SPEAKER_02]: So live listeners, if we are too loud, let us know, please.

1194
01:37:58,460 --> 01:38:03,184
[SPEAKER_02]: We'd be happy to turn down the volume a little bit so you guys don't have to suffer so much.

1195
01:38:03,924 --> 01:38:06,846
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's probably not so... I mean, Loki's yelled for seven years.

1196
01:38:07,427 --> 01:38:10,109
[SPEAKER_02]: That's his thing on the show, if you haven't figured that out by now.

1197
01:38:10,569 --> 01:38:11,350
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not yelling.

1198
01:38:11,750 --> 01:38:12,371
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't yell.

1199
01:38:13,422 --> 01:38:14,303
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know what you're talking about.

1200
01:38:31,997 --> 01:38:34,598
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll try to make sure it doesn't get out of control.

1201
01:38:34,898 --> 01:38:38,840
[SPEAKER_02]: So, chatters, please feel free to speak up if Loki is getting too loud.

1202
01:38:40,201 --> 01:38:40,521
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.

1203
01:38:40,561 --> 01:38:41,702
[SPEAKER_02]: We got a lot of emails this week.

1204
01:38:42,782 --> 01:38:45,784
[SPEAKER_02]: This comes to us from J-Rod.

1205
01:38:46,504 --> 01:38:47,284
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, OLR folks.

1206
01:38:47,605 --> 01:38:50,166
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm writing in a comment on Left 4 Dead 2 Boycott.

1207
01:38:50,586 --> 01:38:55,948
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to stand on the other side of the fence from all the opinions in the OLR studio just for argument's sake.

1208
01:38:56,308 --> 01:38:59,969
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not one of the people who are butthurt about this, but I can understand why people are pissed.

1209
01:39:00,389 --> 01:39:04,370
[SPEAKER_02]: I agree that the game is coming out way too soon since the first one was just released in November.

1210
01:39:04,790 --> 01:39:13,613
[SPEAKER_02]: The reason people are pissed isn't because they are spoiled, it's because they expect more from Valve with integrity compared to, say, Activision in regards to putting out sequels for a cash grab.

1211
01:39:14,093 --> 01:39:14,653
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for watching!

1212
01:39:38,587 --> 01:39:42,471
[SPEAKER_02]: to address Loki's statement on huge E3 lines for the game and how everyone is going to buy it.

1213
01:39:42,512 --> 01:39:50,461
[SPEAKER_02]: That's fine and dandy, but I don't expect to hear any whining when everyone buys piles upon piles of the newest Guitar Hero and Wii Fit sports games.

1214
01:39:51,201 --> 01:39:53,144
[SPEAKER_02]: Which is funny because we just whined about that earlier in the show.

1215
01:39:53,624 --> 01:39:55,125
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, one more shorter point.

1216
01:39:55,466 --> 01:39:59,769
[SPEAKER_02]: Everyone at the OLR studio seems to be taking a crap on Sony for their lack of content for this year.

1217
01:40:00,130 --> 01:40:03,313
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you all completely missed Sony's biggest release of the year, Infamous?

1218
01:40:03,933 --> 01:40:10,759
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm actually surprised to hear nobody on the show talking about it because it's a very big PS3 exclusive release put out by Sucker Punch.

1219
01:40:11,179 --> 01:40:13,101
[SPEAKER_02]: PS, $250 for a PSP?

1220
01:40:13,421 --> 01:40:14,983
[SPEAKER_02]: Apparently cocaine is a hell of a drug.

1221
01:40:15,303 --> 01:40:18,466
[SPEAKER_02]: This email is sponsored by the Olive Garden Home with the never-ending salad and breadsticks.

1222
01:40:18,686 --> 01:40:19,827
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I heard about Infamous.

1223
01:40:20,047 --> 01:40:21,429
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm well aware of it being out.

1224
01:40:21,789 --> 01:40:28,276
[SPEAKER_03]: And unfortunately, though, I'm playing Prototype, which is almost... I mean, it's not identical, but I mean, it's the same type of gameplay right now.

1225
01:40:28,843 --> 01:40:31,545
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think you didn't hear us say anything about it because the game, like, came out.

1226
01:40:31,705 --> 01:40:35,127
[SPEAKER_02]: So there wasn't really a lot of, like, hoo-bub about it at E3.

1227
01:40:35,167 --> 01:40:36,888
[SPEAKER_02]: It was, you know, more of... They had it there.

1228
01:40:37,048 --> 01:40:41,932
[SPEAKER_02]: I think they had it there, but it was just, you know, people weren't really paying attention to that because they're like, hey, this is out next week.

1229
01:40:42,332 --> 01:40:43,853
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's look at, you know, all this other stuff.

1230
01:40:44,113 --> 01:40:52,439
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it seemed like, I think part of the point you were trying to make last week is that it seemed like there was this huge gap in the rest of 2009, and then we've got all this stuff that's supposed to come out in 2010.

1231
01:40:52,479 --> 01:40:56,021
[SPEAKER_02]: Although it does seem like, you know, we'll be peppered with a few nice things here and there.

1232
01:40:56,161 --> 01:40:57,462
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I mean, Infamous looks good.

1233
01:40:57,482 --> 01:41:06,691
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm planning on picking it up maybe later on, but like I mentioned earlier, I have two PlayStation 3 games, though, that have come out back in... One in November, one in...

1234
01:41:08,217 --> 01:41:08,697
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for watching!

1235
01:41:27,543 --> 01:41:29,845
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think it's Microsoft's fault I think it's EA's fault

1236
01:41:47,492 --> 01:41:47,532
[SPEAKER_03]: E.A.

1237
01:41:47,873 --> 01:41:49,014
[SPEAKER_03]: would be the publisher.

1238
01:41:49,034 --> 01:42:01,989
[SPEAKER_03]: At the same time, though, they're saying, oh, well, we've made enhancements to the AI, to the director, and there's stuff that we couldn't have done in Left 4 Dead 1.

1239
01:42:02,089 --> 01:42:06,735
[SPEAKER_03]: And really, at the end, it's the developer deciding to do it or not.

1240
01:42:06,835 --> 01:42:07,416
[SPEAKER_03]: Because they...

1241
01:42:09,181 --> 01:42:09,962
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't have to.

1242
01:42:10,202 --> 01:42:11,943
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're talking download content, you know.

1243
01:42:11,963 --> 01:42:21,710
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, they could put out those enhancements, you know, the map packs and stuff like that for Left 4 Dead or, you know, other stuff, maybe Team Fortress 2 and stuff, maybe add, you know, sell it.

1244
01:42:22,011 --> 01:42:23,252
[SPEAKER_03]: They could put that stuff out.

1245
01:42:23,372 --> 01:42:26,214
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, if it's, you know, the fact that it's being, you know,

1246
01:42:27,383 --> 01:42:27,923
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1247
01:42:54,656 --> 01:42:55,316
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for watching!

1248
01:43:15,000 --> 01:43:15,721
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1249
01:43:34,239 --> 01:43:40,561
[SPEAKER_03]: And at the same time, like I mentioned before, don't you guys think you might be a little bit spoiled by them?

1250
01:43:40,741 --> 01:43:45,383
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I think their support of the community and everything has been huge.

1251
01:43:45,443 --> 01:43:47,143
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, look at what they're doing with Team Fortress 2.

1252
01:43:47,543 --> 01:43:55,046
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just like updates upon updates for this game that came out, you know, a while ago and still, you know, huge support for it.

1253
01:43:55,806 --> 01:44:03,570
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think at the same time, you don't realize that, you know, yeah, they're putting a lot of support behind this, but at the same time, they need to make some money too.

1254
01:44:03,790 --> 01:44:08,533
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, that's not an excuse, I guess, in the gamers' eyes to put out another game.

1255
01:44:08,913 --> 01:44:15,596
[SPEAKER_03]: But at the same time, maybe there's something that really they can't do, or they felt, okay, this is different enough that it justifies its own release.

1256
01:44:17,277 --> 01:44:17,657
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

1257
01:44:18,098 --> 01:44:22,860
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you can't just have everything be exactly the same all the time.

1258
01:44:23,240 --> 01:44:24,501
[SPEAKER_03]: Things have to change, so...

1259
01:44:26,348 --> 01:44:29,109
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess, you know, if you don't like it, don't buy it.

1260
01:44:29,609 --> 01:44:30,389
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, you know what?

1261
01:44:30,829 --> 01:44:34,790
[SPEAKER_03]: If the sales suck on it, then you'll learn, okay, maybe we can't do this.

1262
01:44:35,030 --> 01:44:36,951
[SPEAKER_03]: If that's really, you know, a money grab.

1263
01:44:39,391 --> 01:44:45,873
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, yeah, we have some comments on chat, and, uh, you know, again, it seems to be that most people are saying, Actdeft says, bah, cry more.

1264
01:44:45,953 --> 01:44:48,193
[SPEAKER_02]: That's my opinion on the Left 4 Dead 2 boycott.

1265
01:44:48,794 --> 01:44:53,895
[SPEAKER_02]: GameGuru says, I'm willing to give Left 4 Dead 2 the benefit of the doubt, because it means Left 4 Dead 1 will be cheaper.

1266
01:44:56,971 --> 01:44:57,353
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.

1267
01:44:59,813 --> 01:45:00,093
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

1268
01:45:00,113 --> 01:45:03,295
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess we'll see a little more when this game actually is released.

1269
01:45:03,515 --> 01:45:06,958
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's when I have to reserve my ultimate judgment for is when the game's released.

1270
01:45:07,378 --> 01:45:10,040
[SPEAKER_02]: If it stinks then, then I'll be right there in line with you guys.

1271
01:45:10,060 --> 01:45:17,665
[SPEAKER_02]: And if they try to push out Left 4 Dead 3 in 2010, if Left 4 Dead 2 stinks, I will openly mock it here on this program.

1272
01:45:17,725 --> 01:45:21,247
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, and just, you know, I wouldn't exactly blame Microsoft for it.

1273
01:45:21,347 --> 01:45:24,169
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, look at the company that's helping them publish these games.

1274
01:45:24,649 --> 01:45:28,852
[SPEAKER_03]: They're known for putting out numerous sports games each year numerically.

1275
01:45:28,932 --> 01:45:29,172
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean...

1276
01:45:32,373 --> 01:45:35,995
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to read this email real quick, and this comes to us from our old buddy Rene.

1277
01:45:36,996 --> 01:45:41,619
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going to read the whole thing because it's very, very lengthy, but I do want to read bits and pieces of it and give this game a little shout-out here.

1278
01:45:42,119 --> 01:45:43,220
[SPEAKER_02]: Greetings, OLR peoples.

1279
01:45:43,601 --> 01:45:49,044
[SPEAKER_02]: Rene here, and I just got into the free limited beta for Ion Online that happened for the weekend of June 7th.

1280
01:45:49,384 --> 01:45:55,188
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm trying the game out because Warcraft has become the doldrums and also because it's become my best friend's next fangasm until Final Fantasy XIV.

1281
01:45:56,329 --> 01:45:56,949
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for watching!

1282
01:46:16,516 --> 01:46:17,077
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1283
01:46:39,338 --> 01:46:40,618
[SPEAKER_02]: Something WoW neglects.

1284
01:46:41,018 --> 01:46:45,059
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're in a high traffic area and it's really bogging your system down, it's no problem.

1285
01:46:45,459 --> 01:46:48,960
[SPEAKER_02]: Press a keyboard combination and all other player models will disappear.

1286
01:46:50,500 --> 01:46:53,381
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't get to try out stuff like parties, alliances, emotes, etc.

1287
01:46:53,401 --> 01:46:56,661
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of interface elements that would need a plugin for WoW to show up.

1288
01:46:56,701 --> 01:46:59,502
[SPEAKER_02]: For example, a quest tracker or a level gauge for quests.

1289
01:46:59,762 --> 01:47:02,682
[SPEAKER_02]: For some reason, there's a quest to steal a bathing nymph's clothes too.

1290
01:47:03,122 --> 01:47:07,083
[SPEAKER_02]: I've taken screenshots of what I've seen around the game with the game running almost everything at max settings.

1291
01:47:07,563 --> 01:47:10,024
[SPEAKER_02]: No anti-aliasing, decreased shadow and water effects.

1292
01:47:10,384 --> 01:47:12,845
[SPEAKER_02]: Please skim through it and post to chat if you would like.

1293
01:47:13,345 --> 01:47:14,866
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully Aion will not disappoint.

1294
01:47:14,946 --> 01:47:19,308
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm buying the limited edition and getting suckered into playing it anyway because I want to play with my best friend.

1295
01:47:19,348 --> 01:47:24,330
[SPEAKER_02]: My expectations are low because WoW's PvP just left me insulted with how slow and unfair it was.

1296
01:47:24,750 --> 01:47:27,811
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe Aion will be a little closer to something resembling PSO.

1297
01:47:28,491 --> 01:47:33,293
[SPEAKER_02]: Lastly, I'd like to apologize, especially to Sky, for bringing up hopes for a Mega Man Legends 3 for E3.

1298
01:47:33,333 --> 01:47:33,473
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry!

1299
01:47:35,034 --> 01:47:37,095
[SPEAKER_02]: This email is brought to you by Benefiber.

1300
01:47:37,215 --> 01:47:38,595
[SPEAKER_02]: Everyone needs their damn fiber.

1301
01:47:38,655 --> 01:47:39,796
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck yeah, bowel movements.

1302
01:47:39,916 --> 01:47:45,938
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a question, and this is kind of E3 related, but in the whole Mega Man Legends thing.

1303
01:47:47,118 --> 01:47:50,659
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember Capcom said they had two secret games that they hadn't announced yet.

1304
01:47:51,139 --> 01:47:56,401
[SPEAKER_03]: One of those got leaked, and that was Tatsunoko vs. Capcom, All-Stars or whatever it was.

1305
01:47:56,901 --> 01:47:57,922
[SPEAKER_03]: What the hell was the second one?

1306
01:47:57,942 --> 01:48:00,402
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, hold on, because we've got a call, and I bet this caller might know.

1307
01:48:00,642 --> 01:48:01,543
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

1308
01:48:01,583 --> 01:48:01,923
[SPEAKER_02]: Who's this?

1309
01:48:02,642 --> 01:48:05,804
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, what's up guys, it's the Rob D. Rob, we had you on hold while Loki was saying that.

1310
01:48:05,824 --> 01:48:06,905
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you know what that second game is?

1311
01:48:07,605 --> 01:48:09,747
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it was a Resident Evil title for the PSP.

1312
01:48:10,147 --> 01:48:11,368
[SPEAKER_02]: Ah, okay, that's right.

1313
01:48:11,388 --> 01:48:16,371
[SPEAKER_10]: I remember hearing that being announced, and I asked a couple people about it, and I think that's what it was.

1314
01:48:16,631 --> 01:48:17,211
[SPEAKER_02]: That makes sense.

1315
01:48:17,271 --> 01:48:21,754
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, Rob, we have the Skyplanes open all night tonight, so I know you're calling in to respond to something in the mailbag.

1316
01:48:21,774 --> 01:48:25,356
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, you said on chat something about this whole Left 4 Dead 2 boycott.

1317
01:48:25,396 --> 01:48:26,217
[SPEAKER_02]: What are your thoughts on it?

1318
01:48:27,096 --> 01:48:27,856
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, here's the thing.

1319
01:48:27,956 --> 01:48:29,917
[SPEAKER_10]: I've seen a lot of different complaints.

1320
01:48:30,217 --> 01:48:36,799
[SPEAKER_10]: Obviously, people love to complain about everything on forums and on podcasts and everything when it relates to the video game industry because people are passionate about it.

1321
01:48:36,839 --> 01:48:37,579
[SPEAKER_10]: It's their interest.

1322
01:48:38,079 --> 01:48:40,000
[SPEAKER_10]: And I've seen people defend a lot of stupid things.

1323
01:48:40,120 --> 01:48:44,761
[SPEAKER_10]: I've seen people defend us getting nickel and dimed for horse armor.

1324
01:48:44,781 --> 01:48:45,182
[SPEAKER_10]: And you know what?

1325
01:48:45,242 --> 01:48:46,202
[SPEAKER_10]: That even brings up a lot of...

1326
01:48:47,082 --> 01:48:47,923
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1327
01:49:11,418 --> 01:49:12,519
[SPEAKER_10]: We flipped upside down.

1328
01:49:12,619 --> 01:49:13,879
[SPEAKER_10]: Now we don't want sequels.

1329
01:49:13,899 --> 01:49:19,563
[SPEAKER_10]: We don't want these companies to actually give us new engines and give us new sets of things to do.

1330
01:49:19,623 --> 01:49:20,723
[SPEAKER_10]: We want expansion packs.

1331
01:49:21,023 --> 01:49:22,604
[SPEAKER_10]: What has changed now?

1332
01:49:22,924 --> 01:49:25,426
[SPEAKER_10]: I would give one of my good kidneys to get a sequel.

1333
01:49:25,606 --> 01:49:31,509
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, certainly before this year for Street Fighter and now for a true sequel to Chrono Trigger or Marvel vs. Capcom 3.

1334
01:49:32,950 --> 01:49:36,131
[SPEAKER_10]: Why are people upset that they're getting more a sequel to a game they love?

1335
01:49:36,151 --> 01:49:36,892
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't get this.

1336
01:49:38,417 --> 01:49:39,278
[SPEAKER_02]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1337
01:49:59,966 --> 01:50:23,339
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I think the argument being, and again, I don't really know the other side as well, maybe we'll get emails on it next week, but I think the argument is they feel like, because this is being put together so quickly, because the early screenshots and gameplay indicate it's basically Left 4 Dead 1 with new characters and during the day in a new setting, that this is basically like a guitar hero Van Halen of Left 4 Dead.

1338
01:50:24,124 --> 01:50:27,285
[SPEAKER_10]: But we're making our judgments on a handful of trailers and a few screenshots.

1339
01:50:27,465 --> 01:50:29,966
[SPEAKER_10]: And you hinted at this earlier, that this is Valve.

1340
01:50:30,006 --> 01:50:31,127
[SPEAKER_10]: This is not a company.

1341
01:50:32,027 --> 01:50:34,628
[SPEAKER_10]: Admittedly, I think it is published by EA, right?

1342
01:50:34,688 --> 01:50:36,049
[SPEAKER_10]: Or maybe you're talking about Rock Band.

1343
01:50:36,689 --> 01:50:38,610
[SPEAKER_03]: No, this is published by EA.

1344
01:50:39,470 --> 01:50:39,610
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

1345
01:50:40,530 --> 01:50:45,312
[SPEAKER_10]: I understand that since it is published by EA, that is some cause for concern.

1346
01:50:45,352 --> 01:50:45,913
[SPEAKER_10]: But you know what?

1347
01:50:46,013 --> 01:50:49,354
[SPEAKER_10]: This isn't a company that has done this in the past, that is developing this game.

1348
01:50:51,127 --> 01:50:52,268
[SPEAKER_10]: We should give them a little bit of trust.

1349
01:50:53,309 --> 01:50:55,930
[SPEAKER_02]: Deekman in chat says they think it will break up the community.

1350
01:50:56,050 --> 01:50:57,852
[SPEAKER_02]: It will split them between the two games.

1351
01:50:58,032 --> 01:51:00,654
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if I necessarily see that so much.

1352
01:51:02,115 --> 01:51:05,297
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll look at Call of Duty World at War and Call of Duty Modern Warfare.

1353
01:51:05,717 --> 01:51:07,839
[SPEAKER_02]: The games that that happens to are the sports games.

1354
01:51:08,759 --> 01:51:34,481
[SPEAKER_02]: that's the one where you go into EA 2010 you know whatever and then 2009 is abandoned you know but most games you still find you know pretty like case in point EverQuest 1 and EverQuest 2 granted completely different type of game because people invest a lot more time into those types of games but EverQuest 1 still has probably more of a community than EverQuest 2 so any other thoughts Rob D before we let you go and wrap up part A here

1355
01:51:35,069 --> 01:51:35,629
[SPEAKER_10]: Not really.

1356
01:51:35,709 --> 01:51:48,593
[SPEAKER_10]: This whole issue just ticks me off so much because, again, there's so many games that I can think of and I don't want to bash it, but there's so many games that I enjoy more that I would want sequels to and these people are complaining because they are getting a sequel to it and in good timing, too.

1357
01:51:48,973 --> 01:51:50,914
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, let's just hope that the sequel's not cheap.

1358
01:51:51,014 --> 01:51:57,996
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's hope that what you and I are thinking is the case and that this game will be pretty awesome with a lot of new features or else, I don't know, they may have a point.

1359
01:51:58,916 --> 01:51:59,756
[SPEAKER_10]: I think they'll eat crow.

1360
01:51:59,897 --> 01:52:01,037
[SPEAKER_10]: But anyway, see you guys later.

1361
01:52:01,077 --> 01:52:01,777
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, take care, Rob.

1362
01:52:02,657 --> 01:52:03,198
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I don't know.

1363
01:52:03,478 --> 01:52:04,698
[SPEAKER_02]: I think, I don't know.

1364
01:52:05,376 --> 01:52:07,377
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't tell until I play the game.

1365
01:52:28,146 --> 01:52:32,650
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura is on her way home, so it sounds like she'll be joining us for Part B tonight.

1366
01:52:32,930 --> 01:52:37,254
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll be right back in about 5-10 minutes with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

1367
01:52:37,274 --> 01:52:40,377
[SPEAKER_02]: For those of you guys listening on the podcast though, you only have to wait like 5 seconds.

1368
01:52:40,457 --> 01:52:40,978
[SPEAKER_02]: Aren't you lucky?

1369
01:52:41,238 --> 01:52:43,540
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll be right back with plenty more stories here on Orange Lounge Radio.

1370
01:52:49,648 --> 01:52:58,597
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome back everybody to Part B of tonight's episode number 327 taping live on allgames.com on this lovely Sunday night.

1371
01:52:58,737 --> 01:53:06,945
[SPEAKER_02]: We are here, Orange Lounge Radio, myself, Loki, and making her way back into the studio, DarkSakura is here joining us for Part B tonight.

1372
01:53:07,233 --> 01:53:11,595
[SPEAKER_13]: Hi, I'm just, I will be officially joining probably in about another 10, 15 minutes.

1373
01:53:11,615 --> 01:53:13,216
[SPEAKER_02]: You had a PE class or something tonight, right?

1374
01:53:13,236 --> 01:53:13,956
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, I did.

1375
01:53:14,076 --> 01:53:21,419
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm taking, well, it's walking slash jogging slash running slash cardio slash whatever we want to do as long as it gets the heart rate up for 20 minutes.

1376
01:53:21,599 --> 01:53:22,340
[SPEAKER_13]: That's the class.

1377
01:53:22,980 --> 01:53:25,741
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's mostly online, so it's honor system, you know, pretty much.

1378
01:53:25,901 --> 01:53:32,364
[SPEAKER_13]: But the test our teacher has us do now and the fact that she watches us walk our mile...

1379
01:53:33,784 --> 01:53:38,286
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't think, unless someone really can fake it well, I don't think anyone's going to be able to.

1380
01:53:39,147 --> 01:53:39,527
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.

1381
01:53:40,307 --> 01:53:43,409
[SPEAKER_13]: And apparently this is her third one, and she's had a lot of success with it, so I'm pretty happy.

1382
01:53:43,629 --> 01:53:44,889
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, well, that's all right.

1383
01:53:44,969 --> 01:53:48,211
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki and I are going to continue to juggle the stories, but please chime in.

1384
01:53:48,631 --> 01:53:52,012
[SPEAKER_02]: I know I told you before the show about the new experiment we were trying tonight.

1385
01:53:52,052 --> 01:53:56,034
[SPEAKER_02]: We almost went two hours with part A, six stories, but lots of opinions out there.

1386
01:53:56,334 --> 01:54:02,901
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, you know, I actually, I kind of, I was thinking about it actually while I was doing my very painful because of my shoes walk.

1387
01:54:04,142 --> 01:54:07,725
[SPEAKER_13]: No, I got new walking shoes and I need insoles for them because it makes my arch hurt.

1388
01:54:07,946 --> 01:54:09,687
[SPEAKER_13]: But anyway, enough fitness talk.

1389
01:54:10,869 --> 01:54:13,551
[SPEAKER_13]: I actually want to get back into playing DDR.

1390
01:54:14,372 --> 01:54:17,215
[SPEAKER_13]: Because I walked a 13 minute mile when I was playing DDR once a week.

1391
01:54:17,654 --> 01:54:19,076
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm on DDR.

1392
01:54:19,096 --> 01:54:22,560
[SPEAKER_02]: I went to Roseville Golf Land this week, the place where video games go to die.

1393
01:54:22,640 --> 01:54:25,824
[SPEAKER_02]: I played that lovely, lovely Beatmania 2DX distorted machine they had.

1394
01:54:26,264 --> 01:54:27,806
[SPEAKER_02]: Player 1 black keys are sticking already.

1395
01:54:28,567 --> 01:54:28,887
[SPEAKER_02]: Gotta love it.

1396
01:54:28,907 --> 01:54:29,288
[SPEAKER_13]: That's okay.

1397
01:54:29,328 --> 01:54:29,928
[SPEAKER_13]: Right side pride.

1398
01:54:30,914 --> 01:54:31,374
[SPEAKER_02]: Whatever.

1399
01:54:31,635 --> 01:54:33,216
[SPEAKER_13]: Ha ha, I don't have to deal with that.

1400
01:54:33,236 --> 01:54:34,537
[SPEAKER_03]: Die in a right side fire.

1401
01:54:34,657 --> 01:54:35,177
[SPEAKER_03]: Burn.

1402
01:54:35,197 --> 01:54:44,564
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, now that I'm not upstairs anymore in my apartment, my DDR hard pads, as soon as I figure out how to ground them from the static electricity buildup.

1403
01:54:44,684 --> 01:54:49,048
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's not revive the DDR discussion from last week because I'll just get really sad.

1404
01:54:49,828 --> 01:54:50,549
The whole thing.

1405
01:54:51,349 --> 01:54:52,890
[SPEAKER_02]: My pads actually started falling apart.

1406
01:54:52,910 --> 01:54:54,530
[SPEAKER_02]: Now you're going to have to mod them for eight arrows.

1407
01:54:54,991 --> 01:54:56,411
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember, that's what we're getting in the PlayStation.

1408
01:54:56,431 --> 01:54:57,732
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I'm sorry, that's not real DDR.

1409
01:54:58,192 --> 01:55:00,113
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't buy this Konami bullshit.

1410
01:55:00,333 --> 01:55:01,293
[SPEAKER_02]: No, we can't think of anything.

1411
01:55:01,333 --> 01:55:02,514
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's add more arrows.

1412
01:55:02,614 --> 01:55:03,374
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm more curious.

1413
01:55:03,394 --> 01:55:04,294
[SPEAKER_02]: Wait, hold on about DDR.

1414
01:55:04,334 --> 01:55:08,136
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm more curious what Jamie was thinking on her walk because it was about the show and the whole thing.

1415
01:55:09,236 --> 01:55:18,100
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, no, I was just thinking about what it was going to be like and it actually is going to be more like when Larry King has people call in except we're cooler and he's old.

1416
01:55:18,922 --> 01:55:26,726
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you know, and I think a lot of the feedback I've kind of heard over the couple years we've been doing this, you know, because it seems like every year or two years we try something new with the format.

1417
01:55:27,086 --> 01:55:30,828
[SPEAKER_02]: So about, we've been doing what, this whole combined A and B for about, what, a year and a half or so?

1418
01:55:31,228 --> 01:55:34,550
[SPEAKER_02]: I think one of the feedback I get is, you know, we already kind of hear about the news.

1419
01:55:34,710 --> 01:55:37,912
[SPEAKER_02]: I tune in to hear you guys, you know, talk about it, make jokes and so forth.

1420
01:55:38,212 --> 01:55:42,234
[SPEAKER_02]: And the fact that, you know, not a lot of shows are as interactive as you guys.

1421
01:55:42,274 --> 01:55:47,457
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, granted, there's lots of shows that are trying to get interactive, you know, but they're kind of few and far between, right?

1422
01:55:47,577 --> 01:55:47,757
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, Rob.

1423
01:55:47,777 --> 01:55:47,877
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

1424
01:55:47,897 --> 01:55:48,358
[SPEAKER_13]: A dick went fart.

1425
01:55:48,398 --> 01:55:48,538
[SPEAKER_13]: What?

1426
01:56:15,272 --> 01:56:15,973
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm laughing.

1427
01:56:17,975 --> 01:56:22,119
[SPEAKER_13]: I am going to go freshen up.

1428
01:56:24,261 --> 01:56:25,302
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.

1429
01:56:25,322 --> 01:56:28,385
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's get back into some of that gaming news that we're going to spend a little more time on tonight.

1430
01:56:28,425 --> 01:56:29,646
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, you can call us at any time.

1431
01:56:29,666 --> 01:56:31,147
[SPEAKER_02]: 1-877-GAME-OLR.

1432
01:56:31,448 --> 01:56:36,472
[SPEAKER_02]: If we don't get to the story you wanted to talk about tonight, though, we will open up the skyline at the end of the show for Open Bar.

1433
01:56:37,233 --> 01:56:37,493
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki!

1434
01:56:38,334 --> 01:56:41,775
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to start us off this half with another story.

1435
01:56:41,995 --> 01:56:42,455
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, I am.

1436
01:56:43,515 --> 01:56:51,877
[SPEAKER_03]: So apparently the PS3 motion controller that they showed off at E3... You know what?

1437
01:56:51,977 --> 01:56:53,317
[SPEAKER_02]: That always happens.

1438
01:56:53,557 --> 01:56:53,937
[SPEAKER_02]: Damn it.

1439
01:56:54,358 --> 01:56:54,658
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.

1440
01:56:55,758 --> 01:56:59,059
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe someday I'll learn how to fix my audio cues.

1441
01:56:59,079 --> 01:56:59,339
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.

1442
01:56:59,999 --> 01:57:00,619
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, PlayStation 3.

1443
01:57:01,158 --> 01:57:15,414
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, so the new motion controller they showed off during their E3 press conference, it's apparently going to be compatible with existing games, which it makes sense because you can patch games and...

1444
01:57:16,653 --> 01:57:17,154
[SPEAKER_03]: Why not?

1445
01:57:18,555 --> 01:57:26,942
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not sure if it's exactly going to work the way, say, you think... I don't know, a controller... Like, it wouldn't be mapped.

1446
01:57:27,162 --> 01:57:32,887
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, if I move my arm down, it's not going to move the analog stick left down or something like that.

1447
01:57:32,907 --> 01:57:34,589
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think it's going to be like that.

1448
01:57:35,129 --> 01:57:40,594
[SPEAKER_03]: But they may be able to patch it in to other games, which makes sense because they patched in DualShock 3 support.

1449
01:57:41,675 --> 01:57:42,155
[SPEAKER_03]: Why not?

1450
01:57:42,756 --> 01:57:43,376
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know what?

1451
01:57:43,436 --> 01:57:43,997
[SPEAKER_03]: I support that.

1452
01:57:44,037 --> 01:57:44,217
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean...

1453
01:57:45,319 --> 01:57:46,422
[SPEAKER_03]: That'd be kind of cool.

1454
01:57:46,442 --> 01:57:51,494
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of your older games get new life later on with this controller if you happen to buy it.

1455
01:57:52,014 --> 01:57:54,836
[SPEAKER_02]: But here's my thing and the reason why I want to talk about this a little bit.

1456
01:57:54,896 --> 01:57:59,038
[SPEAKER_02]: Do we really need motion control to be shoved down our throat in every game?

1457
01:57:59,618 --> 01:58:01,599
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't have to be, but it's an option.

1458
01:58:02,300 --> 01:58:08,163
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a good way, say, you put out the motion controller and there's, say, five games that support it.

1459
01:58:08,443 --> 01:58:12,405
[SPEAKER_03]: Now you can have a bunch of games that support it, but it's still going to feel tacked on.

1460
01:58:12,505 --> 01:58:15,427
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe this is what I need to make me feel better about this.

1461
01:58:15,767 --> 01:58:17,428
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe callers want to input on this 1-877-GAME-OLR.

1462
01:58:17,448 --> 01:58:17,568
[SPEAKER_02]: What...

1463
01:58:20,168 --> 01:58:23,959
[SPEAKER_02]: Game would be better if they went back and added motion control.

1464
01:58:26,519 --> 01:58:33,864
[SPEAKER_02]: What Sony PlayStation 3 game is going to be better if they go back and add this whole Sony... It doesn't have an official name, does it yet?

1465
01:58:34,485 --> 01:58:35,766
[SPEAKER_02]: I think somebody said the PS3 mode.

1466
01:58:35,946 --> 01:58:37,847
[SPEAKER_02]: Cosmic Ice Cream Cones of Wonder.

1467
01:58:37,867 --> 01:58:39,809
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, the Cosmic Ice Cream Cones.

1468
01:58:40,329 --> 01:58:43,912
[SPEAKER_02]: What old PlayStation 3 game is going to be better with the Cosmic Ice Cream Cones?

1469
01:58:44,072 --> 01:58:44,472
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

1470
01:58:45,072 --> 01:58:50,096
[SPEAKER_02]: Seeing as most PlayStation 3 games are on the Xbox 360, we don't have that yet.

1471
01:58:50,156 --> 01:58:50,776
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's my thought.

1472
01:58:50,817 --> 01:58:55,540
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe they come up with a control scheme for a first-person shooter.

1473
01:58:56,024 --> 01:58:58,526
[SPEAKER_03]: and then boom, they can put those in the first person shooter games.

1474
01:58:59,367 --> 01:59:00,627
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, something that works well.

1475
01:59:01,928 --> 01:59:03,209
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, you're right, I don't know.

1476
01:59:03,370 --> 01:59:11,716
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't you think this is only going to show up though in the actual Sony, you know, first party in their own developer type of games?

1477
01:59:12,056 --> 01:59:12,937
[SPEAKER_03]: Probably, yeah.

1478
01:59:14,037 --> 01:59:15,358
[SPEAKER_03]: But, I mean, I don't know.

1479
01:59:16,119 --> 01:59:22,464
[SPEAKER_03]: This is all coming from, you know, I want to say, Jack Trenton, who...

1480
01:59:25,090 --> 01:59:28,954
[SPEAKER_03]: He says, personally, it's very difficult for me to perceive God of War 3 played with a Wii controller.

1481
01:59:29,494 --> 01:59:32,817
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's a different experience that doesn't lend itself to certain types of games.

1482
01:59:33,097 --> 01:59:41,104
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think our controller can be used with every game that's on the system now and every game that we're working on.

1483
01:59:41,444 --> 01:59:44,547
[SPEAKER_03]: So he could just be blowing smoke up someone's ass.

1484
01:59:44,907 --> 01:59:45,868
[SPEAKER_03]: My controller's awesome!

1485
01:59:45,908 --> 01:59:46,789
[SPEAKER_03]: It works with everything!

1486
01:59:46,829 --> 01:59:47,650
[SPEAKER_03]: It's super awesome!

1487
01:59:47,690 --> 01:59:49,631
[SPEAKER_03]: Everything that we touch turns to gold!

1488
01:59:50,012 --> 01:59:51,373
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's basically his...

1489
01:59:52,854 --> 01:59:53,374
[SPEAKER_03]: Thought on it.

1490
01:59:53,474 --> 01:59:56,436
[SPEAKER_03]: So really we could be reading way too much into this.

1491
01:59:57,076 --> 02:00:08,701
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the games you're going to see that get this enhancement, like Infamous, Killzone 3, all the first person shooters basically, Uncharted, and Resistance.

1492
02:00:09,301 --> 02:00:11,962
[SPEAKER_02]: Those will be the games that will support this whole Cosmic Ice Cream Codes.

1493
02:00:13,823 --> 02:00:15,944
[SPEAKER_03]: Honestly, I don't think it's any of these games at all.

1494
02:00:16,264 --> 02:00:19,546
[SPEAKER_03]: I think since this isn't going to come out for a while, it'll probably be...

1495
02:00:21,539 --> 02:00:26,323
[SPEAKER_03]: I would be fine if they didn't even patch it backwards because it's just going to be tacking it on.

1496
02:00:26,683 --> 02:00:30,246
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just, I don't know.

1497
02:00:31,407 --> 02:00:43,176
[SPEAKER_03]: It's 1-1 control, so unless you have it really programmed in the game to be really intricate, I don't think it's going to work because you're just going to be making a gesture and it's going to do an action just like the Wii.

1498
02:00:44,008 --> 02:01:06,590
[SPEAKER_02]: and I think a lot of it is resources for me that's why I kind of bring this up you know I know there's a lot of people out there that would say well what's the harm so they want to go back and add motion control in these games is that such a bad thing it's added value it's something extra but I'm saying well resources that could be used to instead make new games better why go back and patch the game with motion controls when you can make the sequel have motion controls

1499
02:01:07,529 --> 02:01:08,629
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1500
02:01:34,241 --> 02:01:38,124
[SPEAKER_03]: Unless there really is a team still working on it, which I don't think there is.

1501
02:01:38,644 --> 02:01:39,425
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think there is either.

1502
02:01:40,485 --> 02:01:42,807
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's move on and talk about something else with Sony.

1503
02:01:42,847 --> 02:01:50,492
[SPEAKER_02]: And it has to do kind of from the same sort of original source that the whole PlayStation 3 motion control can do with.

1504
02:01:51,513 --> 02:01:58,157
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to talk about the president of PlayStation, Jack Trenton, and leaks.

1505
02:01:59,118 --> 02:02:01,780
[SPEAKER_02]: And a big quote he said, you know...

1506
02:02:02,731 --> 02:02:03,231
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1507
02:02:30,933 --> 02:02:32,074
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1508
02:02:49,429 --> 02:02:50,470
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, at the same time.

1509
02:02:50,670 --> 02:02:56,473
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people that work in the game industry stay in the game industry, so I would think there's talk amongst people.

1510
02:02:56,913 --> 02:02:59,674
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, they all sign NDAs, but I don't think they hold up.

1511
02:02:59,815 --> 02:03:00,695
[SPEAKER_03]: Sniff out your moles.

1512
02:03:01,015 --> 02:03:07,298
[SPEAKER_03]: If it's really a big issue for you and you really want to crack down on them, start releasing false information.

1513
02:03:07,519 --> 02:03:11,281
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the people that report on it, you release a different one to each person.

1514
02:03:11,721 --> 02:03:13,882
[SPEAKER_03]: And the people that report on that, then you know where it came from.

1515
02:03:15,359 --> 02:03:17,420
[SPEAKER_02]: And then Trenton continues on with this quote.

1516
02:03:17,560 --> 02:03:17,780
[SPEAKER_02]: Really?

1517
02:03:37,466 --> 02:03:43,551
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm tired of all these podcasters that go on air and talk about all the different ways they interpret a patent.

1518
02:03:43,931 --> 02:03:46,053
[SPEAKER_02]: No, he didn't really say that, but that's the way he's really saying it.

1519
02:03:46,253 --> 02:04:07,049
[SPEAKER_03]: Really didn't water it down because the PSP Go, which has been rumored to be coming out for a while now, and then leaked by them, I mean, by Sony through Core, which really, can you complain about leaks and stuff when your own magazine seems to put out the information before your press conference?

1520
02:04:08,251 --> 02:04:09,952
[SPEAKER_03]: Really, did it water it down at all?

1521
02:04:10,132 --> 02:04:11,552
[SPEAKER_03]: In fact, I don't think it did.

1522
02:04:12,533 --> 02:04:19,895
[SPEAKER_03]: If anything, it got people's hopes up, and then we saw what they announced the features for it, and we're like, eh, that sounds stupid.

1523
02:04:20,715 --> 02:04:22,976
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, oh, you didn't add a second analog stick?

1524
02:04:23,196 --> 02:04:30,359
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, you didn't make it so that, I don't know, it does other things other than normal PlayStation?

1525
02:04:30,539 --> 02:04:33,060
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, it's not going to be cheaper than the PSP 3000 or something like that?

1526
02:04:35,646 --> 02:04:36,107
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1527
02:04:51,205 --> 02:04:53,726
[SPEAKER_02]: What a great entry-level PSP system this is going to be.

1528
02:04:53,766 --> 02:04:56,686
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be a great, cheap device that people are going to use.

1529
02:04:56,706 --> 02:04:57,707
[SPEAKER_02]: They can get rid of the disk.

1530
02:04:57,767 --> 02:04:58,547
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be cheap.

1531
02:04:58,827 --> 02:04:59,427
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be easy.

1532
02:04:59,447 --> 02:05:05,368
[SPEAKER_02]: What was the real surprise that we all got slapped with at E3?

1533
02:05:05,608 --> 02:05:08,249
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I'd like to go on the record saying that I never thought it was a good idea.

1534
02:05:08,589 --> 02:05:14,690
[SPEAKER_03]: But I did think that the whole not having a UMD drive in there was a stupid idea.

1535
02:05:14,750 --> 02:05:17,111
[SPEAKER_03]: I couldn't believe that they were that stupid to do that.

1536
02:05:17,771 --> 02:05:19,071
[SPEAKER_03]: And sure enough, they were that stupid.

1537
02:05:41,727 --> 02:05:44,330
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, but it has Blu-ray, and it's $600!

1538
02:05:45,170 --> 02:05:49,955
[SPEAKER_02]: So whoever's determining what the prices should be at Sony needs to wake the fuck up, basically, is what it is.

1539
02:05:51,076 --> 02:05:53,539
[SPEAKER_02]: And stop eating crayons, Jamie is yelling from the kitchen.

1540
02:05:55,580 --> 02:05:57,703
[SPEAKER_02]: Isn't the door supposed to be shut while recording is in progress?

1541
02:05:57,743 --> 02:05:58,103
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I'm kidding.

1542
02:06:01,178 --> 02:06:13,067
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, if you want to comment on this, 1877gameOLR, looking at some comments in chat, GameGuru says, cheap is the term that Sony needs to learn.

1543
02:06:13,928 --> 02:06:17,451
[SPEAKER_02]: D5T says, moving to flash-based media is the future.

1544
02:06:17,871 --> 02:06:19,132
[SPEAKER_02]: Movable parts are old.

1545
02:06:19,472 --> 02:06:21,033
[SPEAKER_02]: See, I'm almost with him here.

1546
02:06:21,113 --> 02:06:26,757
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you can't say Sony, screw you for losing UMD when you're also watching on the same token.

1547
02:06:26,837 --> 02:06:35,643
[SPEAKER_02]: Microsoft's now getting into digital distribution with the whole classic Xbox 360 games, or I'm sorry, new Xbox 360 games available for download on the site.

1548
02:06:35,963 --> 02:06:44,029
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we were talking in the first half of the show tonight about Xbox possibly launching a cheaper console next year that's going to be targeted at the family audience.

1549
02:06:44,389 --> 02:06:46,991
[SPEAKER_02]: Who's to say that if they do that, this system...

1550
02:06:47,651 --> 02:06:55,860
[SPEAKER_02]: is going to lose the disk drive completely and could possibly be an online-only download thing using the hand-wavy Natal device to make you choose your games.

1551
02:06:56,220 --> 02:06:58,062
[SPEAKER_03]: It won't work because people like buying stuff.

1552
02:06:58,082 --> 02:07:00,264
[SPEAKER_03]: They like having the physical disk in their hand.

1553
02:07:00,665 --> 02:07:05,089
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, I know people that have the iPhone and stuff go crazy over the App Store because there's everything in there.

1554
02:07:05,490 --> 02:07:06,171
[SPEAKER_03]: But you know what?

1555
02:07:07,312 --> 02:07:07,872
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just...

1556
02:07:08,593 --> 02:07:13,976
[SPEAKER_03]: If you could go, if it took like discs or something like that, I'm sure people would probably want to buy this because you know what?

1557
02:07:14,276 --> 02:07:15,317
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what you can do with discs?

1558
02:07:15,577 --> 02:07:18,459
[SPEAKER_03]: You can return them when they don't work.

1559
02:07:18,559 --> 02:07:20,860
[SPEAKER_03]: You can return them when you don't like them.

1560
02:07:20,900 --> 02:07:23,202
[SPEAKER_03]: You can return them when you're done with them.

1561
02:07:23,282 --> 02:07:24,302
[SPEAKER_03]: You can resell them.

1562
02:07:24,682 --> 02:07:27,144
[SPEAKER_03]: With digital download, you bought it, you're stuck with it.

1563
02:07:27,424 --> 02:07:28,525
[SPEAKER_03]: If it sucks, too bad.

1564
02:07:28,705 --> 02:07:29,145
[SPEAKER_02]: You bought it.

1565
02:07:29,585 --> 02:07:35,889
[SPEAKER_02]: Deekman in our chatroom, chat.orangelandsradio.com says the reason they gave for the price was to compete with the iPhone.

1566
02:07:36,249 --> 02:07:37,710
[SPEAKER_02]: If Apple can do it, then so can we.

1567
02:07:37,730 --> 02:07:37,790
[SPEAKER_02]: And

1568
02:07:39,531 --> 02:07:43,213
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically, they think they can get away with it since people pay for it.

1569
02:07:43,593 --> 02:07:46,515
[SPEAKER_02]: Apple's tech, they'll pay it for ours.

1570
02:07:47,055 --> 02:07:48,195
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, well, whoops.

1571
02:07:49,056 --> 02:07:51,537
[SPEAKER_02]: It was just announced this week that the iPhone's coming down to $99.

1572
02:07:53,098 --> 02:07:53,398
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura.com

1573
02:08:10,678 --> 02:08:15,402
[SPEAKER_02]: And seriously, if Sony didn't see that one coming, they are mentally deficient.

1574
02:08:15,702 --> 02:08:19,645
[SPEAKER_02]: And whoever did not see that one coming at Sony needs to be fired.

1575
02:08:19,765 --> 02:08:21,826
[SPEAKER_02]: They have no business working in business.

1576
02:08:22,267 --> 02:08:24,709
[SPEAKER_02]: A moron walking off the street.

1577
02:08:25,389 --> 02:08:30,093
[SPEAKER_02]: My mother, who doesn't even know how to put a CD in a computer, could tell you.

1578
02:08:31,414 --> 02:08:34,556
[SPEAKER_02]: Apple, I love my mom, but she's technically stupid.

1579
02:08:35,637 --> 02:08:37,478
[SPEAKER_02]: And I can say that in the nicest possible way.

1580
02:08:37,999 --> 02:08:39,380
[SPEAKER_02]: Even my mother knows.

1581
02:08:40,367 --> 02:09:02,683
[SPEAKER_02]: every every June Apple gets up there parades out Steve Jobs they couldn't do that this year obviously with their one more thing everybody knows Apple upgrades their shit every year and gets people to buy it all over again it works for Apple it is not going to work for Sony at those prices

1582
02:09:03,993 --> 02:09:05,174
[SPEAKER_03]: Sony is not Apple.

1583
02:09:05,494 --> 02:09:08,917
[SPEAKER_03]: And the other thing too is they have a huge following with Apple.

1584
02:09:09,357 --> 02:09:11,879
[SPEAKER_03]: Sony doesn't quite have that following with the PSP.

1585
02:09:12,399 --> 02:09:13,140
[SPEAKER_03]: And to be honest...

1586
02:09:14,479 --> 02:09:20,805
[SPEAKER_03]: I really, really hate to say this, but there's more features in the iPhone than there are right now in the PSP.

1587
02:09:21,085 --> 02:09:22,366
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's got a touchscreen on it.

1588
02:09:22,406 --> 02:09:26,730
[SPEAKER_03]: Hell, if they added a touchscreen to the PSP, that might be a whole different story.

1589
02:09:26,790 --> 02:09:29,212
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, that might be worth picking up because that's completely different.

1590
02:09:29,272 --> 02:09:37,119
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to open up a whole different set of possibilities if they had support with Bluetooth or something like that.

1591
02:09:37,439 --> 02:09:38,260
[SPEAKER_03]: Big whoop.

1592
02:09:38,720 --> 02:09:39,160
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, goody.

1593
02:09:39,981 --> 02:09:50,530
[SPEAKER_02]: And look, you know, and to those that want to make the argument that, well, you know, Apple releases their new, you know, toys at high end prices, you know, granted, I'll give you that.

1594
02:09:50,991 --> 02:09:53,613
[SPEAKER_02]: Their laptops, I don't think I'm going to buy another Apple laptop.

1595
02:09:53,893 --> 02:09:55,995
[SPEAKER_02]: They are too expensive for what you get.

1596
02:09:57,416 --> 02:09:58,217
[SPEAKER_02]: For someone like me.

1597
02:10:00,779 --> 02:10:01,480
[SPEAKER_02]: Your mic's not on, dear.

1598
02:10:01,500 --> 02:10:01,540
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh.

1599
02:10:02,113 --> 02:10:02,693
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, shit.

1600
02:10:03,593 --> 02:10:25,200
[SPEAKER_13]: I went to talking with some other people in the art industry, you know, and a couple people were actually saying that they were noticing that there's not as much need for people to have a Mac these days in the industry now that the PCs are catching up and, you know, different programs are saying, hey, people actually use PCs, you know.

1601
02:10:25,960 --> 02:10:28,841
[SPEAKER_13]: So even that edge is starting to blur.

1602
02:10:28,881 --> 02:10:28,961
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

1603
02:10:29,661 --> 02:10:33,504
[SPEAKER_02]: I think Apple's in for a rude awakening in the laptop market within the next couple years.

1604
02:10:33,724 --> 02:10:36,566
[SPEAKER_02]: But they've got it on the iPhone.

1605
02:10:37,027 --> 02:10:38,668
[SPEAKER_02]: Apple right now is a phone company.

1606
02:10:38,988 --> 02:10:40,249
[SPEAKER_02]: That is what Apple is doing best.

1607
02:10:40,269 --> 02:10:42,751
[SPEAKER_02]: They are a phone and music company.

1608
02:10:42,811 --> 02:10:46,013
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't really... Well, God, I'm going to get so much hate mail for this.

1609
02:10:46,273 --> 02:10:50,937
[SPEAKER_02]: But look, as somebody who's going out there wanting to get a new laptop and so forth...

1610
02:10:51,417 --> 02:10:52,558
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura.com

1611
02:11:11,789 --> 02:11:15,852
[SPEAKER_02]: You have the $199 iPhone, the $249 PSP Go.

1612
02:11:16,373 --> 02:11:17,674
[SPEAKER_02]: I can watch movies on both.

1613
02:11:17,934 --> 02:11:18,214
[SPEAKER_02]: Check.

1614
02:11:18,554 --> 02:11:19,916
[SPEAKER_02]: I can get on the internet with both.

1615
02:11:20,216 --> 02:11:20,516
[SPEAKER_02]: Check.

1616
02:11:20,836 --> 02:11:22,097
[SPEAKER_02]: I can play music on both.

1617
02:11:22,398 --> 02:11:22,678
[SPEAKER_02]: Check.

1618
02:11:22,978 --> 02:11:25,460
[SPEAKER_02]: I can play games on both that I download online.

1619
02:11:25,580 --> 02:11:25,900
[SPEAKER_02]: Check.

1620
02:11:26,281 --> 02:11:31,625
[SPEAKER_02]: The only thing the Sony PSP has got is that the games are of a higher caliber than the ones you see on the iPhone.

1621
02:11:31,725 --> 02:11:32,526
[SPEAKER_02]: I will give it that.

1622
02:11:32,586 --> 02:11:39,711
[SPEAKER_03]: Right now, and supposedly the 3GS has better specs or something than the 3G, so maybe they will...

1623
02:11:42,523 --> 02:11:44,025
[SPEAKER_03]: Be a little bit better later on.

1624
02:11:45,326 --> 02:11:50,952
[SPEAKER_03]: And it also doesn't have actual control pads, so that does kind of limit them as far as games go.

1625
02:11:53,567 --> 02:11:59,611
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, Ranma in chat says, Rob Roberts, everything you have done on your MacBook can be done on a $500 PC laptop flawlessly.

1626
02:11:59,951 --> 02:12:01,452
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I'm starting to find out too.

1627
02:12:01,552 --> 02:12:05,275
[SPEAKER_02]: And part of what I loved about Macs is that they were so easy, you know, so great.

1628
02:12:05,715 --> 02:12:06,496
[SPEAKER_02]: But here's the nice thing.

1629
02:12:06,756 --> 02:12:09,898
[SPEAKER_02]: PC, finally, someone at Microsoft kind of wised up.

1630
02:12:10,078 --> 02:12:14,001
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my gosh, Apple's starting to bite into us a little bit here with this whole, I think they're making it easier.

1631
02:12:14,813 --> 02:12:15,113
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

1632
02:12:15,233 --> 02:12:17,695
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to open up this whole can of worms on the computer debate.

1633
02:12:17,715 --> 02:12:18,515
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not what I want to do.

1634
02:12:18,996 --> 02:12:21,337
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to talk about the PSP Go and all this stuff.

1635
02:12:21,797 --> 02:12:25,920
[SPEAKER_02]: And the whole fact that it's $2.49 is way too much to be charging for that.

1636
02:12:26,740 --> 02:12:28,801
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, that wasn't even really originally what I wanted to talk about.

1637
02:12:29,021 --> 02:12:33,824
[SPEAKER_02]: It was supposed to be about keeping secrets in the industry and people not respecting confidentiality in the industry.

1638
02:12:33,844 --> 02:12:37,086
[SPEAKER_02]: There's this fine line here.

1639
02:12:42,259 --> 02:12:43,480
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1640
02:13:04,825 --> 02:13:07,266
[SPEAKER_02]: How much is too much in regards to confidentiality?

1641
02:13:07,646 --> 02:13:09,247
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, the demand is out there.

1642
02:13:09,327 --> 02:13:10,087
[SPEAKER_02]: People want to know.

1643
02:13:10,387 --> 02:13:14,568
[SPEAKER_02]: The millisecond these things are thought of, Sony is even thinking about doing this.

1644
02:13:15,108 --> 02:13:16,149
[SPEAKER_02]: People want to know about it.

1645
02:13:16,409 --> 02:13:19,230
[SPEAKER_02]: How far is too far with this whole confidentiality?

1646
02:13:19,470 --> 02:13:20,570
[SPEAKER_02]: Did this go too far?

1647
02:13:21,030 --> 02:13:23,871
[SPEAKER_02]: Did the PSP go getting announced early and a lot of these other things?

1648
02:13:23,951 --> 02:13:25,252
[SPEAKER_02]: Was that too far?

1649
02:13:25,272 --> 02:13:26,512
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

1650
02:13:26,532 --> 02:13:28,553
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't have an easy answer for this.

1651
02:13:28,573 --> 02:13:29,793
[SPEAKER_03]: Then don't tell these people.

1652
02:13:29,893 --> 02:13:32,334
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want to keep a secret, you don't say anything.

1653
02:13:33,188 --> 02:13:38,070
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't keep a secret by saying, go and tell 100 people, oh, by the way, don't tell anybody this.

1654
02:13:38,090 --> 02:13:41,292
[SPEAKER_02]: But don't you have to tell your developers that are going to be making the games?

1655
02:13:41,772 --> 02:13:45,614
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, obviously someone else is blogging about it and leaking this stuff out.

1656
02:13:46,254 --> 02:13:50,616
[SPEAKER_03]: You have people that are leaking out stuff all the time, and they can hide behind the internet.

1657
02:13:50,976 --> 02:13:51,936
[SPEAKER_03]: They can be whomever.

1658
02:13:51,996 --> 02:14:02,021
[SPEAKER_03]: They can be some industry mole and go on the record and stuff, and they probably get some sort of joy out of having the exclusive story that no one knows about.

1659
02:14:04,693 --> 02:14:05,595
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1660
02:14:15,154 --> 02:14:17,015
[SPEAKER_02]: How come all these other people can get away with it?

1661
02:14:17,035 --> 02:14:18,535
[SPEAKER_02]: That's where it gets de-irritating.

1662
02:14:18,555 --> 02:14:32,961
[SPEAKER_03]: We've also seen in the past too with NDAs where other people are given preferential treatment because they're a big website and they're going to run an exclusive story or let's decide which website gets to run the exclusive story.

1663
02:14:32,981 --> 02:14:38,204
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's the shit that needs to stop right now because that's just encouraging people to one-up others.

1664
02:14:38,384 --> 02:14:38,864
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry.

1665
02:14:39,164 --> 02:14:39,884
[SPEAKER_02]: No pun intended.

1666
02:14:43,246 --> 02:14:43,506
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyhow.

1667
02:14:44,611 --> 02:14:45,131
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's move on.

1668
02:15:08,109 --> 02:15:08,550
[SPEAKER_02]: Outro Music

1669
02:15:27,412 --> 02:15:31,293
[SPEAKER_03]: And removing features to cut costs is not an answer, Apple.

1670
02:15:31,753 --> 02:15:32,414
[SPEAKER_02]: So, anyhow.

1671
02:15:33,274 --> 02:15:33,494
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.

1672
02:15:34,174 --> 02:15:35,935
[SPEAKER_02]: I apologize for getting completely off track.

1673
02:15:36,295 --> 02:15:37,335
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's get back to video games.

1674
02:15:37,595 --> 02:15:39,976
[SPEAKER_02]: And oh, what a video game on the next story, correct?

1675
02:15:40,156 --> 02:15:40,476
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

1676
02:15:41,196 --> 02:15:43,537
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, this is a classic in...

1677
02:15:43,977 --> 02:16:13,197
[SPEAKER_03]: A Remade Game Now Coming To Xbox Live Arcade As An Exclusive For A Limited Time That Would Be Of Course The Brand New Or I Guess Brand New Remade Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Turtles In Time Reshelled Which Looks Pretty Awesome Actually Completely Redone 3D And Of Course Will Be Available On Xbox Live Arcade July 22nd But As For The Playstation Network

1678
02:16:14,079 --> 02:16:14,659
[SPEAKER_03]: Later this year.

1679
02:16:37,188 --> 02:16:39,869
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there some underlying technical problem that's causing this to be delayed?

1680
02:16:39,889 --> 02:16:41,150
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think there's a technical problem at all.

1681
02:16:41,330 --> 02:16:42,651
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's a deal.

1682
02:16:42,731 --> 02:16:45,692
[SPEAKER_03]: Because if you think about it, this is actually part of the Summer of Live.

1683
02:16:46,153 --> 02:16:49,875
[SPEAKER_03]: Or the Live Arcade, Summer of Arcade, whatever the hell they're calling that.

1684
02:16:50,355 --> 02:16:52,996
[SPEAKER_03]: So they're going to get an extra marketing push because of that.

1685
02:16:53,196 --> 02:16:56,918
[SPEAKER_03]: And probably the deal was that they got to put it out later because of that.

1686
02:16:57,098 --> 02:16:58,299
[SPEAKER_02]: What marketing push?

1687
02:16:59,099 --> 02:16:59,800
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, really?

1688
02:17:00,060 --> 02:17:04,502
[SPEAKER_02]: Is being in the Summer of Arcade that much of a boost to sales?

1689
02:17:04,542 --> 02:17:05,002
[SPEAKER_02]: It might be.

1690
02:17:05,282 --> 02:17:05,643
[SPEAKER_02]: Really?

1691
02:17:05,663 --> 02:17:05,743
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1692
02:17:06,661 --> 02:17:07,142
[SPEAKER_02]: What do they do?

1693
02:17:07,442 --> 02:17:09,485
[SPEAKER_02]: What's the big deal about being in the summer of arcade?

1694
02:17:10,046 --> 02:17:13,831
[SPEAKER_02]: The fact that they cluster a lot of highly anticipated games all together.

1695
02:17:14,451 --> 02:17:17,636
[SPEAKER_02]: But for most Xbox Live Arcade games, I can think of anything I've anticipated.

1696
02:17:17,756 --> 02:17:19,178
[SPEAKER_02]: I knew where to seek it out and buy it.

1697
02:17:19,819 --> 02:17:22,302
[SPEAKER_02]: Do they run extra ads in magazines?

1698
02:17:22,342 --> 02:17:22,963
[SPEAKER_02]: They have like a...

1699
02:17:24,003 --> 02:17:25,664
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess.

1700
02:17:25,764 --> 02:17:28,045
[SPEAKER_02]: It just doesn't seem like that much of a boost.

1701
02:17:28,085 --> 02:17:29,526
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I'm just speculating.

1702
02:17:29,586 --> 02:17:30,586
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

1703
02:17:31,026 --> 02:17:33,407
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe they had trouble developing it on the PlayStation Network.

1704
02:17:33,567 --> 02:17:34,328
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know what it is.

1705
02:17:34,408 --> 02:17:36,969
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think they would because Ubisoft, I would imagine.

1706
02:17:37,369 --> 02:17:38,149
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, they're publishing it.

1707
02:17:38,189 --> 02:17:39,450
[SPEAKER_03]: Who knows who's developing it?

1708
02:17:39,490 --> 02:17:41,971
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

1709
02:17:43,431 --> 02:17:44,692
[SPEAKER_03]: It could be something retarded.

1710
02:17:45,072 --> 02:17:46,233
[SPEAKER_03]: It probably is something retarded.

1711
02:17:47,533 --> 02:17:48,234
[SPEAKER_03]: But you know what?

1712
02:17:48,294 --> 02:17:49,174
[SPEAKER_03]: Just get used to it.

1713
02:17:50,543 --> 02:17:52,046
[SPEAKER_02]: I need to see more of this game in action.

1714
02:17:52,146 --> 02:17:58,015
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's pretty much a port of the old arcade game but with the cooler, upgraded graphics?

1715
02:17:58,376 --> 02:17:59,197
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1716
02:18:00,139 --> 02:18:00,860
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess that's kind of neat.

1717
02:18:02,223 --> 02:18:04,485
[SPEAKER_02]: Super NES Exclusive, wasn't the Super Famicom version a direct port?

1718
02:18:21,681 --> 02:18:22,662
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe Turtles and Thieves

1719
02:18:49,898 --> 02:18:54,500
[SPEAKER_02]: And then DarkTetsuya says, I forget, I just remember the Super Nintendo version having the extra levels and bosses.

1720
02:18:55,000 --> 02:18:56,100
[SPEAKER_02]: Ooh, are we getting some of that in this?

1721
02:18:56,240 --> 02:18:57,101
[SPEAKER_02]: Extra levels and stuff?

1722
02:18:57,401 --> 02:18:58,301
[SPEAKER_02]: There might be extra levels.

1723
02:18:59,301 --> 02:19:02,843
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, THB Ninja Turtles was a pretty huge Xbox Live game when it came out anyway.

1724
02:19:03,523 --> 02:19:05,804
[SPEAKER_02]: Folks playing it online and having fun on live with it.

1725
02:19:05,864 --> 02:19:07,384
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm sure this is going to be no different.

1726
02:19:07,505 --> 02:19:08,185
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure it'll be fun.

1727
02:19:08,405 --> 02:19:08,585
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

1728
02:19:08,945 --> 02:19:10,145
[SPEAKER_02]: So, there you go.

1729
02:19:10,806 --> 02:19:15,487
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, well that game will be coming out July 22nd, I believe it was.

1730
02:19:15,587 --> 02:19:16,728
[SPEAKER_02]: So keep an eye out for that.

1731
02:19:17,918 --> 02:19:18,799
[SPEAKER_02]: Metal Gear Solid Rising

1732
02:19:33,274 --> 02:19:35,715
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people were waiting for it, the whole Metal Gear Solid 4 thing.

1733
02:19:35,755 --> 02:19:43,357
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, now it should be noted, Metal Gear Solid Rising is not exclusive to the Xbox, or it's going on Xbox and PlayStation.

1734
02:19:43,777 --> 02:19:49,599
[SPEAKER_02]: And a lot of folks are saying, well, this is, you know, it's going to still be, it's like Metal Gear is continuing on, or what have you.

1735
02:19:50,379 --> 02:19:54,800
[SPEAKER_02]: But, apparently, it is a whole new engine for Metal Gear Solid Rising.

1736
02:19:54,820 --> 02:20:01,182
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're thinking this is Metal Gear Solid 4 Plus, or some game that was made in Metal Gear Solid 4's engine, uh-uh.

1737
02:20:02,600 --> 02:20:09,762
[SPEAKER_02]: Sean Eyestone, who is an assistant producer at Kojima Productions, says the team is remaking Rising's engine from scratch.

1738
02:20:10,222 --> 02:20:14,943
[SPEAKER_02]: Their goal is to make it look better than Metal Gear Solid 4.

1739
02:20:15,623 --> 02:20:20,385
[SPEAKER_02]: This is from a Kojima Productions podcast that came out this week.

1740
02:20:21,485 --> 02:20:24,666
[SPEAKER_02]: Apparently, they are saying it is a big project like Metal Gear Solid 4.

1741
02:20:25,266 --> 02:20:29,347
[SPEAKER_02]: The team is serious about making it look as good as possible on every platform.

1742
02:20:31,015 --> 02:20:31,575
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for watching!

1743
02:20:49,148 --> 02:20:58,472
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, now it's coming out on both systems because I think they know that it would be a mistake to skip on the 360 because there is a lot of potential sales there.

1744
02:20:58,492 --> 02:21:04,554
[SPEAKER_03]: Especially now that they didn't have Metal Gear Solid 4 and so they're going to get a lot more money out of it.

1745
02:21:04,634 --> 02:21:07,555
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's all about money nowadays because, you know, times are tough.

1746
02:21:08,156 --> 02:21:10,096
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I'm not surprised.

1747
02:21:10,616 --> 02:21:11,317
[SPEAKER_03]: And I am...

1748
02:21:12,358 --> 02:21:15,761
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, it'd be weird if they kind of went in the opposite direction.

1749
02:21:16,662 --> 02:21:19,845
[SPEAKER_03]: But, I mean, it makes sense to them, just to put it out on both systems.

1750
02:21:20,806 --> 02:21:25,750
[SPEAKER_02]: TheRobD in chat, by the way, says, So we're going from talking about a Turtles game to talking about Solid Snakes.

1751
02:21:25,850 --> 02:21:26,751
[SPEAKER_02]: What does this show become?

1752
02:21:27,172 --> 02:21:29,894
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, it's Reptile Jungle tonight on Orange Lounge Radio, apparently.

1753
02:21:30,234 --> 02:21:33,017
[SPEAKER_02]: Chat.OrangeLoungeRadio.com if you want to make a smart-ass comment like that one.

1754
02:21:33,678 --> 02:21:33,758
[SPEAKER_02]: Um...

1755
02:21:35,479 --> 02:21:46,913
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, I guess at first, when I first heard about this, I was like, oh, they're cranking this game out so fast because Metal Gear Solid 4, they're just going to reuse that engine and so forth.

1756
02:21:46,933 --> 02:21:48,895
[SPEAKER_02]: But now, that doesn't seem to be the case.

1757
02:21:49,416 --> 02:21:49,716
[SPEAKER_02]: So...

1758
02:21:51,637 --> 02:21:52,997
[SPEAKER_02]: You could look at this a couple of ways.

1759
02:21:53,418 --> 02:21:57,258
[SPEAKER_02]: I get really excited when I hear, oh, they're going to make it look even better and so forth.

1760
02:21:57,658 --> 02:22:03,300
[SPEAKER_02]: But weren't they saying one of the reasons that they didn't port Metal Gear Solid 4 to the Xbox 360?

1761
02:22:03,680 --> 02:22:05,920
[SPEAKER_02]: And let's face it, folks, they never will at this point.

1762
02:22:06,160 --> 02:22:07,000
[SPEAKER_02]: It is not happening.

1763
02:22:07,400 --> 02:22:08,361
[SPEAKER_02]: This is what you're getting.

1764
02:22:08,701 --> 02:22:10,381
[SPEAKER_02]: Be happy with this, Microsoft fans.

1765
02:22:10,901 --> 02:22:13,682
[SPEAKER_02]: There is not Metal Gear Solid 4 coming to the Xbox 360.

1766
02:22:14,042 --> 02:22:17,022
[SPEAKER_02]: If that was ever going to happen, it would have been announced before this.

1767
02:22:17,682 --> 02:22:20,083
[SPEAKER_02]: So, that being said...

1768
02:22:21,585 --> 02:22:28,048
[SPEAKER_02]: They said that Metal Gear Solid 4 would not be ported to the Xbox 360 because it was made for Blu-ray.

1769
02:22:28,268 --> 02:22:32,950
[SPEAKER_02]: The types of graphics that were on it and everything that was packed in that disc was made for Blu-ray.

1770
02:22:33,491 --> 02:22:43,355
[SPEAKER_02]: So that makes me think, okay, well then by that argument, if they're scaling this back to fit every platform, they're going to have to scale it back, not make it better.

1771
02:22:43,816 --> 02:22:44,156
[SPEAKER_02]: Wrong.

1772
02:22:44,516 --> 02:22:46,437
[SPEAKER_03]: And this goes back to what we were talking about earlier.

1773
02:22:47,438 --> 02:22:58,964
[SPEAKER_03]: Melgar Solve 4 was going to max out the PS3, but now they've learned that they can optimize their code, there's different techniques, and to be honest, I mean, their excuse was, oh, it's so big it can only fit on Blu-ray.

1774
02:22:59,424 --> 02:23:08,429
[SPEAKER_03]: But at the same time, you know, oh, and no one wants to swap discs, by the way, which is retarded because there's like a five minute install between like sections of the game.

1775
02:23:09,974 --> 02:23:10,554
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, come on.

1776
02:23:10,714 --> 02:23:12,035
[SPEAKER_03]: They could have easily swapped discs.

1777
02:23:12,115 --> 02:23:18,177
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd rather spend two seconds to swap a disc than spend five minutes loading a section of the game to my hard drive.

1778
02:23:18,338 --> 02:23:24,600
[SPEAKER_03]: And if I really wanted to do that with multiple discs, I can do that now in the new Microsoft interface.

1779
02:23:24,660 --> 02:23:26,421
[SPEAKER_02]: I can install each portion if I wanted to.

1780
02:23:26,801 --> 02:23:28,582
[SPEAKER_02]: TigerClaw in chat makes a really good point.

1781
02:23:28,642 --> 02:23:32,464
[SPEAKER_02]: Says, also noticed Metal Gear Solid Rising says, lightning bolt action.

1782
02:23:32,864 --> 02:23:34,304
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe it's a new type of gameplay.

1783
02:23:34,604 --> 02:23:37,626
[SPEAKER_02]: Given that Raiden is a ninja, it could very well be a hack and slash game.

1784
02:23:38,866 --> 02:23:43,567
[SPEAKER_02]: Have we had anything confirmed that this is a stealth action game like the other Metal Gear Solid games?

1785
02:23:43,947 --> 02:23:45,348
[SPEAKER_02]: Or is Tigerclaw into something here?

1786
02:23:45,388 --> 02:23:49,549
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it's not Metal Gear Solid 5, it's Metal Gear Solid Rising.

1787
02:23:50,489 --> 02:23:55,690
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe the type of game we're anticipating here should be, maybe we need to set our expectations for something different.

1788
02:23:55,990 --> 02:23:57,991
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe we're looking at an action game, a beat-em-up.

1789
02:23:59,224 --> 02:23:59,904
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know about that.

1790
02:23:59,924 --> 02:24:03,566
[SPEAKER_02]: The Turtles in Time version of Metal Gear Solid.

1791
02:24:03,886 --> 02:24:08,668
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know about that far, but that is interesting that it doesn't say anything about the whole stealth.

1792
02:24:09,028 --> 02:24:10,149
[SPEAKER_02]: It's lightning bolt action.

1793
02:24:13,590 --> 02:24:16,372
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think that would be as successful if they change up the genre?

1794
02:24:19,133 --> 02:24:19,513
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe.

1795
02:24:20,113 --> 02:24:20,593
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe not.

1796
02:24:21,514 --> 02:24:22,914
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess it just depends on how good the game is.

1797
02:24:22,934 --> 02:24:26,356
[SPEAKER_03]: I think people will bitch and moan, but they'll probably still buy it because they're Metal Gear Solid fans.

1798
02:24:26,963 --> 02:24:27,324
[SPEAKER_02]: Perhaps.

1799
02:24:28,465 --> 02:24:29,026
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, we'll see.

1800
02:24:29,346 --> 02:24:30,568
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's continue on with some more news.

1801
02:24:30,949 --> 02:24:36,937
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want to call us on this or any topic we're talking about, 1-877-GAME-OLR.

1802
02:24:36,957 --> 02:24:38,079
[SPEAKER_02]: We had a phone call a little while.

1803
02:24:38,359 --> 02:24:38,820
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't be shy.

1804
02:24:38,880 --> 02:24:39,241
[SPEAKER_02]: Give us a call.

1805
02:24:39,261 --> 02:24:39,481
[SPEAKER_02]: 1-877-GAME-OLR.

1806
02:24:41,840 --> 02:24:46,542
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, Xbox Live Community Games, they're getting a little bit of a facelift.

1807
02:24:46,982 --> 02:24:56,025
[SPEAKER_03]: Starting in late July, Xbox Live Community Games will now be changing to Xbox Live Indie Games.

1808
02:24:56,985 --> 02:25:05,448
[SPEAKER_03]: And apparently it's in response to community feedback in order to increase understanding and promote the games.

1809
02:25:06,108 --> 02:25:08,789
[SPEAKER_03]: So they're going to launch XNA Game Studio 3.1 and

1810
02:25:12,315 --> 02:25:13,036
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1811
02:25:42,964 --> 02:25:43,384
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

1812
02:25:51,491 --> 02:25:55,653
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of them are really good, but a lot of them are really, really bad.

1813
02:25:55,673 --> 02:25:58,895
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you think about this whole rating system that's coming into the games?

1814
02:25:58,955 --> 02:26:00,555
[SPEAKER_02]: Is this going to be a good thing or a bad thing?

1815
02:26:00,736 --> 02:26:01,416
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's a good thing.

1816
02:26:01,936 --> 02:26:06,158
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll be able to separate the crap from the not crap.

1817
02:26:06,578 --> 02:26:11,701
[SPEAKER_03]: I would love to see user-rated stuff, so I can look at these games that people think are great.

1818
02:26:12,141 --> 02:26:16,243
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe have a way that you can see what your friends rate it, or something like that.

1819
02:26:16,283 --> 02:26:18,244
[SPEAKER_03]: If I have similar tastes as, say, Rob, I can...

1820
02:26:19,264 --> 02:26:19,525
[SPEAKER_03]: DigEffect

1821
02:26:29,266 --> 02:26:34,070
[SPEAKER_02]: You know how stories get bumped to the top of dig.com that you're like, why the hell is this here?

1822
02:26:34,551 --> 02:26:38,174
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's because so-and-so has millions of friends that will dig up the story for them.

1823
02:26:38,694 --> 02:26:42,878
[SPEAKER_02]: And to be fair, we've had it happen to our stories before, and I'm sure that's thanks to our OL Army.

1824
02:26:43,299 --> 02:26:44,420
[SPEAKER_02]: So don't hear me wrong.

1825
02:26:44,460 --> 02:26:46,562
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not necessarily a bad thing or whatever.

1826
02:26:47,002 --> 02:26:54,228
[SPEAKER_02]: But I would be worried in regards to this context with the whole indie games is that what if a game maker...

1827
02:26:54,949 --> 02:26:55,890
[SPEAKER_02]: and DarkSakura.com

1828
02:27:10,526 --> 02:27:11,166
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1829
02:27:29,757 --> 02:27:46,701
[SPEAKER_02]: But it sucks that somebody who, you know, might be a fan of some other show who doesn't know how to support any podcasting, who deserves to have karma bite him in the ass or something, can have somebody go around and rate a bunch of other shows a 1 and nothing gets taken, you know, no action gets taken against that user.

1830
02:27:47,021 --> 02:27:53,002
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, that user's opinion carries just as much weight as somebody who actually thinks out their reviews.

1831
02:27:53,282 --> 02:27:54,763
[SPEAKER_02]: Does that make any sense at all what I'm saying?

1832
02:27:54,803 --> 02:27:55,403
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it makes sense.

1833
02:27:55,483 --> 02:27:55,683
[SPEAKER_02]: Like...

1834
02:27:56,663 --> 02:28:01,587
[SPEAKER_02]: I would fear that just because somebody has a lot of friends, their game gets all this extra exposure.

1835
02:28:01,987 --> 02:28:04,169
[SPEAKER_02]: And you look at the top shows on iTunes.

1836
02:28:04,209 --> 02:28:05,450
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, going back to iTunes, sorry.

1837
02:28:05,730 --> 02:28:07,512
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's something I feel pretty passionate about.

1838
02:28:07,772 --> 02:28:16,979
[SPEAKER_02]: You look at all the top shows on iTunes, most of them are one-ups, IGNs, GameSpots, G4s, commercial, down-your-throat type fare.

1839
02:28:18,360 --> 02:28:23,224
[SPEAKER_02]: And it kind of sucks for the rest of us when podcasts are supposed to be an indie thing.

1840
02:28:24,056 --> 02:28:24,877
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

1841
02:28:45,100 --> 02:28:45,941
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1842
02:29:10,323 --> 02:29:35,127
[SPEAKER_02]: rate the raters would be a great thing rate the raters that's something they need to bring to iTunes is rating the raters and you kind of can to a little bit you can say was this comment helpful yes or no but it really doesn't have any bearing on the author as a whole I think that's something I would like to see is you rate the rater and as the raters rating goes up their rating carries more weight and as it goes down it loses weight that's what I'd like to see

1843
02:29:37,016 --> 02:29:38,517
[SPEAKER_02]: That was a lot of uses of the word rate.

1844
02:29:38,837 --> 02:29:39,878
[SPEAKER_03]: Only in the perfect world.

1845
02:29:40,558 --> 02:29:40,759
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1846
02:29:41,159 --> 02:29:41,979
[SPEAKER_02]: But I don't know.

1847
02:29:41,999 --> 02:29:43,060
[SPEAKER_02]: I kind of think that's the way to do it.

1848
02:29:45,922 --> 02:29:50,645
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, that one indie game you were talking about earlier in the show, Attack... What was it?

1849
02:29:50,705 --> 02:29:51,485
[SPEAKER_02]: Barry Attack?

1850
02:29:51,605 --> 02:29:52,526
[SPEAKER_03]: It was Angry Barry.

1851
02:29:52,606 --> 02:29:53,186
[SPEAKER_02]: Angry Barry.

1852
02:29:53,226 --> 02:29:54,307
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know where I saw that.

1853
02:29:55,307 --> 02:30:02,292
[SPEAKER_03]: And I hate to say this, but IGN, actually, they do a segment that's a community shower, I think is what they call it.

1854
02:30:02,712 --> 02:30:04,013
[SPEAKER_03]: And basically they cover...

1855
02:30:04,873 --> 02:30:06,073
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

1856
02:30:26,600 --> 02:30:34,469
[SPEAKER_02]: Maren in chat brings up a good point and says, but what if somebody doesn't agree with the rating person and so they rate the person lowly based on their opinion, not their review rating?

1857
02:30:34,889 --> 02:30:35,790
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a fair argument.

1858
02:30:35,951 --> 02:30:36,391
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I guess...

1859
02:30:37,472 --> 02:30:58,447
[SPEAKER_03]: The system's, it's going to basically, what it's going to come down to is, yeah, there's going to be people that are going to do that and, you know, rally their friends, but in the end it all equals out because there's a lot more people not involved with them that, you know, are going to be raiding stuff, so that it'll be just a slight fluctuation and that's really kind of, you've got to account for that kind of error in there, so.

1860
02:30:59,267 --> 02:31:00,068
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I hope you're right.

1861
02:31:01,009 --> 02:31:02,190
[SPEAKER_02]: We can all hear you eating over there.

1862
02:31:02,770 --> 02:31:03,950
[SPEAKER_13]: I just hit the mic with my plate.

1863
02:31:06,271 --> 02:31:09,152
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, Kay Levster says, I think it will sort itself out.

1864
02:31:09,472 --> 02:31:12,253
[SPEAKER_02]: The Xbox Live community is far more liquid than Dig.

1865
02:31:12,934 --> 02:31:13,514
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, though.

1866
02:31:13,574 --> 02:31:15,195
[SPEAKER_02]: There's some real, like, come on.

1867
02:31:15,255 --> 02:31:16,555
[SPEAKER_02]: You've played Halo Online.

1868
02:31:16,695 --> 02:31:19,316
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if you have, but a lot of you have played Halo Online.

1869
02:31:19,356 --> 02:31:22,317
[SPEAKER_02]: There are some people who play those games online.

1870
02:31:22,497 --> 02:31:23,838
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to hear their opinions.

1871
02:31:24,198 --> 02:31:25,658
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to hear what they have to say.

1872
02:31:26,059 --> 02:31:26,559
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?

1873
02:31:27,319 --> 02:31:30,143
[SPEAKER_02]: These people that get on there and say N-word, N-word, F-word, F-word.

1874
02:31:30,404 --> 02:31:31,225
[SPEAKER_02]: You know who I'm talking about.

1875
02:31:32,086 --> 02:31:34,109
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there a way I can just block out their ratings?

1876
02:31:34,430 --> 02:31:37,494
[SPEAKER_02]: If I block them on Xbox Live, will it block their ratings out too?

1877
02:31:37,634 --> 02:31:42,442
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it would be really smart and it would also, once again, go back to tying in.

1878
02:31:42,922 --> 02:31:51,586
[SPEAKER_03]: You can do, like, with your Xbox Live Arcade games, you can see where you rank, like, in the leaderboards versus the world versus, you know, your friends.

1879
02:31:51,766 --> 02:31:53,967
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think the reviews should also be the same way.

1880
02:31:54,307 --> 02:31:59,530
[SPEAKER_03]: If your friends have reviewed that, you should be able to see their reviews or you can just see the community as a whole.

1881
02:31:59,610 --> 02:32:00,430
[SPEAKER_02]: Ooh, like Netflix.

1882
02:32:00,910 --> 02:32:01,330
[SPEAKER_02]: Netflix.

1883
02:32:01,650 --> 02:32:02,031
[SPEAKER_02]: Perfect.

1884
02:32:02,151 --> 02:32:02,731
[SPEAKER_02]: Perfect model.

1885
02:32:02,931 --> 02:32:04,712
[SPEAKER_02]: And Xbox has it in with Netflix anyway.

1886
02:32:05,352 --> 02:32:05,492
[SPEAKER_02]: Right?

1887
02:32:05,512 --> 02:32:05,792
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.

1888
02:32:06,072 --> 02:32:06,493
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.

1889
02:32:06,693 --> 02:32:07,593
[SPEAKER_02]: Steal from Netflix.

1890
02:32:08,213 --> 02:32:08,834
[SPEAKER_02]: There's the answer.

1891
02:32:08,994 --> 02:32:09,214
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.

1892
02:32:11,602 --> 02:32:15,364
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to move on to another story, and it has to do with Microsoft.

1893
02:32:15,384 --> 02:32:16,405
[SPEAKER_02]: A whole lot of Microsoft tonight.

1894
02:32:16,705 --> 02:32:25,210
[SPEAKER_02]: But Project Natal, going back to that, we were talking about it a little bit during Part A, but it's made its mainstream television debut.

1895
02:32:25,611 --> 02:32:28,632
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right, it showed up on Late Night with Jimmy Fallon.

1896
02:32:29,333 --> 02:32:30,854
[SPEAKER_02]: It showed up a little earlier this week.

1897
02:32:31,614 --> 02:32:39,936
[SPEAKER_02]: Oops, I'm bringing up the actual Hulu thing here in studio, although they're going to do a commercial here, so I'm going to mute it for that because if the commercial people aren't going to pay us, I'm not going to rebroadcast that.

1898
02:32:40,316 --> 02:32:44,657
[SPEAKER_02]: But I do want to show a little bit about the whole Jimmy Fallon late night thing.

1899
02:32:45,277 --> 02:32:51,218
[SPEAKER_02]: They actually showed Natal on it, and I don't know why, but they all were wearing these red jumpsuits and things when they were demoing it.

1900
02:32:51,518 --> 02:32:56,559
[SPEAKER_02]: But certainly it was interesting, if nothing else, to actually see Natal.

1901
02:32:57,259 --> 02:33:01,061
[SPEAKER_02]: This being played by somebody who wasn't a Microsoft spokesperson.

1902
02:33:01,361 --> 02:33:01,882
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?

1903
02:33:02,582 --> 02:33:04,603
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a real person at least checking this out.

1904
02:33:05,764 --> 02:33:08,625
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's actually see if we can check this out just a little bit here.

1905
02:33:09,606 --> 02:33:10,546
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a bunch of red shirts.

1906
02:33:10,586 --> 02:33:10,946
[SPEAKER_13]: Kill them.

1907
02:33:10,966 --> 02:33:15,349
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to actually forward ahead a little bit here in the video so we can actually see where they're playing.

1908
02:33:17,108 --> 02:33:18,309
[SPEAKER_01]: Jimmy Fallon, you're not funny.

1909
02:33:18,329 --> 02:33:18,589
[SPEAKER_01]: Still.

1910
02:33:18,669 --> 02:33:20,810
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me forward a little ahead to where they're actually playing.

1911
02:33:45,000 --> 02:33:46,941
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like a 3D little breakout game.

1912
02:33:46,981 --> 02:33:49,103
[SPEAKER_02]: This is one of the games they were showing, actually, at E3.

1913
02:33:49,183 --> 02:33:50,464
[SPEAKER_02]: It's one of the demos.

1914
02:33:51,505 --> 02:33:52,786
[SPEAKER_02]: Kind of cool.

1915
02:33:53,787 --> 02:33:58,110
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it looks like fun, you know, to flail around like a fool for a little while, but I don't know for how long.

1916
02:33:58,991 --> 02:34:04,836
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, I don't think there's an actual game here, but if this is a minigame in a much larger game, I think this could be cool.

1917
02:34:05,076 --> 02:34:06,137
[SPEAKER_02]: You're doing it like volleyball.

1918
02:34:08,482 --> 02:34:12,565
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I mean, the game, you know, it looks like it might be fun for a little while.

1919
02:34:13,245 --> 02:34:16,047
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know about the longevity of it, but, you know, a lot of Wii games.

1920
02:34:16,067 --> 02:34:16,768
[SPEAKER_02]: I think this is a demo.

1921
02:34:16,788 --> 02:34:17,708
[SPEAKER_13]: This is a demo, though.

1922
02:34:17,808 --> 02:34:21,231
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but, okay, yeah, to be fair, it's a tech demo, no, like, gameplay.

1923
02:34:21,291 --> 02:34:22,572
[SPEAKER_02]: So was Wii Sports and Wii Play?

1924
02:34:22,592 --> 02:34:25,234
[SPEAKER_02]: So a lot of the things you saw on Wii Play were tech demos, too.

1925
02:34:25,534 --> 02:34:28,396
[SPEAKER_02]: I think this will come out if nothing else is an Xbox Live Arcade game.

1926
02:34:28,596 --> 02:34:29,196
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll see this.

1927
02:34:29,577 --> 02:34:30,938
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll make a game out of this somehow.

1928
02:34:32,399 --> 02:34:38,126
[SPEAKER_13]: I honestly see a whole lot of potential for this technology, though.

1929
02:34:38,166 --> 02:34:38,947
[SPEAKER_13]: There really is.

1930
02:34:41,129 --> 02:34:44,293
[SPEAKER_13]: Honestly, I'm not ready to pass judgment on it yet.

1931
02:34:45,274 --> 02:34:45,795
[SPEAKER_13]: Really, I'm not.

1932
02:34:46,764 --> 02:34:48,905
[SPEAKER_02]: SSJ100 Matt makes a correction to something I was saying.

1933
02:34:48,945 --> 02:34:51,666
[SPEAKER_02]: Correction, Rob, that was the only demo they did on stage, I believe.

1934
02:34:51,946 --> 02:34:52,586
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a good point.

1935
02:34:52,626 --> 02:34:55,027
[SPEAKER_02]: When they did that whole Milo thing, that was a pre-taped video.

1936
02:34:55,208 --> 02:34:56,908
[SPEAKER_03]: But they did a demo on stage, though.

1937
02:34:56,948 --> 02:35:01,230
[SPEAKER_03]: They did that exact same game on stage with Project Natal at the press conference.

1938
02:35:01,250 --> 02:35:04,471
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is like their touring game that they have to show at the stuff.

1939
02:35:04,751 --> 02:35:11,734
[SPEAKER_02]: But still, the nice thing about it was it was, you know, say what you want to about Jimmy Fallon and his humor or lack thereof.

1940
02:35:12,215 --> 02:35:14,555
[SPEAKER_02]: He's not somebody in the game industry.

1941
02:35:14,656 --> 02:35:15,316
[SPEAKER_02]: He's like a...

1942
02:35:15,836 --> 02:35:16,437
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for watching!

1943
02:35:32,020 --> 02:35:34,683
[SPEAKER_02]: and they weren't letting regular people play it.

1944
02:35:34,743 --> 02:35:36,584
[SPEAKER_02]: This was a huge step in actually seeing this.

1945
02:35:36,965 --> 02:35:43,230
[SPEAKER_02]: By the way, sorry to get off track here, but what is up with Jimmy Fallon tapping into the game industry lately?

1946
02:35:43,350 --> 02:35:48,094
[SPEAKER_03]: His thing was that he wants to treat game releases like movie releases.

1947
02:35:48,134 --> 02:35:53,679
[SPEAKER_03]: He's a big gamer, I guess, and apparently he's going to start doing more content like this.

1948
02:35:54,653 --> 02:35:55,374
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1949
02:36:11,331 --> 02:36:12,632
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, to be fair, you know what?

1950
02:36:12,652 --> 02:36:15,733
[SPEAKER_02]: To be fair, Conan had a real rough first six months.

1951
02:36:16,134 --> 02:36:18,295
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, a lot of people wrote him off when the show first started.

1952
02:36:18,575 --> 02:36:19,896
[SPEAKER_02]: He didn't find his niche for a year.

1953
02:36:20,196 --> 02:36:22,317
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm willing to give Jimmy Fallon a year, whatever.

1954
02:36:22,637 --> 02:36:27,419
[SPEAKER_02]: But all that aside, you know, he has been pretty decent, I guess, about coverage.

1955
02:36:27,660 --> 02:36:34,203
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like I'm getting more gaming coverage watching Jimmy Fallon than I am most times I'm watching G4, E3 accepted.

1956
02:36:34,263 --> 02:36:34,763
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?

1957
02:36:35,424 --> 02:36:36,164
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1958
02:36:36,184 --> 02:36:39,386
[SPEAKER_02]: They had Jason Sudeikis or whatever his name is kind of around at E3.

1959
02:36:40,694 --> 02:36:41,415
[SPEAKER_02]: That's kind of funny.

1960
02:36:41,435 --> 02:36:44,978
[SPEAKER_02]: I like the little video they did for that.

1961
02:36:46,800 --> 02:36:48,822
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, Kay Levster in chat makes a funny comment.

1962
02:36:49,523 --> 02:36:52,326
[SPEAKER_02]: He wants to get his games for free, thus now he's scared.

1963
02:36:54,187 --> 02:36:56,430
[SPEAKER_02]: TigerClaw says Jimmy Fallon is a bit of a tech geek.

1964
02:36:56,490 --> 02:36:58,552
[SPEAKER_02]: He had the guys from Dignation on the show before.

1965
02:36:59,192 --> 02:37:01,615
[SPEAKER_02]: He's living up to his promising of promoting video games.

1966
02:37:03,116 --> 02:37:04,538
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I'm glad somebody is.

1967
02:37:07,287 --> 02:37:23,656
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, well, regardless, it was kind of nice to see Natal actually kind of making a show on a big, you know, well, I don't know if you want to say big, but a fair, a show that has at least a million people watching it and getting, you know, a live, real person who doesn't work for the company playing it.

1968
02:37:26,200 --> 02:37:49,505
[SPEAKER_03]: Now to kind of change topics a little bit, apparently Alexey Pajanov, the creator of Tetris, of course Tetris just had its 25th anniversary not too long ago, apparently he's saying that he wants, well it's so huge right now with 125 million copies sold,

1969
02:37:52,246 --> 02:37:56,950
[SPEAKER_03]: and probably one of the biggest, most recognized games out there.

1970
02:37:58,211 --> 02:38:02,734
[SPEAKER_03]: He's saying they could see probably an evolution of Tetris becoming a sport.

1971
02:38:03,975 --> 02:38:13,703
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, the future is that a country that has 48 million people living in it and the biggest casual gaming site in the country has 24 million registered users.

1972
02:38:14,063 --> 02:38:15,244
[SPEAKER_03]: That country is Korea.

1973
02:38:15,804 --> 02:38:17,606
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what's going to happen in the rest of the world.

1974
02:38:18,126 --> 02:38:24,371
[SPEAKER_03]: So kind of like, you know, everybody competing in this first virtual sport.

1975
02:38:25,032 --> 02:38:31,958
[SPEAKER_03]: Sports like baseball and football were created at a time when their future was a lifetime of physical activities and physical fitness.

1976
02:38:32,278 --> 02:38:34,460
[SPEAKER_03]: But now that's not as important.

1977
02:38:35,120 --> 02:38:37,222
[SPEAKER_03]: It's more about mental fitness today.

1978
02:38:37,703 --> 02:38:40,245
[SPEAKER_03]: And Tetris is a virtual sport that exercises the mind.

1979
02:38:40,605 --> 02:38:42,487
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the definition of a virtual sport.

1980
02:38:45,660 --> 02:38:48,521
[SPEAKER_02]: So how exactly would... I guess I'm not getting it.

1981
02:38:48,561 --> 02:38:50,582
[SPEAKER_02]: How exactly... Where would the sport be in this?

1982
02:38:50,622 --> 02:38:51,463
[SPEAKER_03]: Competing one-on-one.

1983
02:38:51,503 --> 02:38:56,025
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just, you know, a bunch of people in a Tetris tournament.

1984
02:38:56,825 --> 02:38:57,366
[SPEAKER_03]: The end.

1985
02:38:58,786 --> 02:38:59,066
[SPEAKER_02]: Hmm.

1986
02:39:00,207 --> 02:39:05,189
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting, though, that it seems like we always have this video games as a sport discussion comes up once in a while.

1987
02:39:05,229 --> 02:39:06,790
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember when they wanted to make DDR a sport?

1988
02:39:06,850 --> 02:39:08,131
[SPEAKER_02]: Or they did in a couple of countries.

1989
02:39:08,171 --> 02:39:09,371
[SPEAKER_03]: I know, but here's the thing.

1990
02:39:09,791 --> 02:39:10,732
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we're looking at it...

1991
02:39:11,969 --> 02:39:14,110
[SPEAKER_03]: When we say sports, we think physical sports.

1992
02:39:14,450 --> 02:39:17,752
[SPEAKER_03]: And he's trying to say that there's other sports out there, like chess.

1993
02:39:17,933 --> 02:39:21,535
[SPEAKER_03]: Chess is not a physical... I mean, you play it physically, but it's more mental.

1994
02:39:21,675 --> 02:39:22,615
[SPEAKER_02]: Is chess at the Olympics?

1995
02:39:23,876 --> 02:39:25,157
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think so.

1996
02:39:25,777 --> 02:39:26,157
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

1997
02:39:26,618 --> 02:39:27,678
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a very good question.

1998
02:39:28,058 --> 02:39:29,239
[SPEAKER_02]: I wonder if one of our chatters knows.

1999
02:39:29,299 --> 02:39:30,380
[SPEAKER_02]: Is chess an Olympic sport?

2000
02:39:31,781 --> 02:39:32,341
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think it is.

2001
02:39:33,742 --> 02:39:34,842
[SPEAKER_03]: But, like, you know, stuff like that.

2002
02:39:34,902 --> 02:39:38,564
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, nowadays, you know, with a lot of gamers out there, and now they have, you know, the...

2003
02:39:39,793 --> 02:39:42,202
[SPEAKER_03]: Championship Gaming stuff that they do which

2004
02:39:43,723 --> 02:39:51,168
[SPEAKER_03]: Making people into actual teams and stuff like that and promoting them like a football team and stuff, that's cool and all, but I don't know.

2005
02:39:51,808 --> 02:39:53,229
[SPEAKER_03]: Not really the model I see.

2006
02:39:53,550 --> 02:39:54,810
[SPEAKER_02]: Three no's in chat, by the way.

2007
02:39:55,931 --> 02:39:57,152
[SPEAKER_02]: Chess is not an Olympic sport.

2008
02:39:57,712 --> 02:40:02,255
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, I even Googled it, and there was an article in Time Magazine August 5th of 08.

2009
02:40:03,336 --> 02:40:08,660
[SPEAKER_02]: Chess and bridge enthusiasts, they are lobbying the International Olympic Committee to allow their games.

2010
02:40:08,680 --> 02:40:09,700
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think that they should be.

2011
02:40:09,880 --> 02:40:13,403
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, the Olympics is a physical sports competition.

2012
02:40:13,863 --> 02:40:14,624
[SPEAKER_03]: It shouldn't be.

2013
02:40:15,725 --> 02:40:18,949
[SPEAKER_03]: DDR shouldn't be really a sport.

2014
02:40:19,109 --> 02:40:23,313
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you play it physically, but it's not... I don't know.

2015
02:40:23,333 --> 02:40:24,555
[SPEAKER_03]: DDR is hard to compete in anyways.

2016
02:40:24,615 --> 02:40:31,121
[SPEAKER_03]: It's basically about accuracy as far as a way to actually grade it and freestyle and stuff.

2017
02:40:31,141 --> 02:40:33,204
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of stupid because that's just interpretive dance, so...

2018
02:40:33,973 --> 02:40:34,253
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

2019
02:40:55,990 --> 02:40:58,691
[SPEAKER_02]: So why shouldn't Tetris be on... Did you ever see the movie Dodgeball?

2020
02:40:59,512 --> 02:40:59,772
[SPEAKER_13]: No.

2021
02:40:59,872 --> 02:41:02,373
[SPEAKER_02]: Because Jamie's giving us this look of like, what the hell are you guys saying?

2022
02:41:02,634 --> 02:41:03,514
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the joke.

2023
02:41:03,594 --> 02:41:05,035
[SPEAKER_13]: I want to know what planet you're from.

2024
02:41:05,215 --> 02:41:05,715
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, anyway.

2025
02:41:07,376 --> 02:41:07,636
[SPEAKER_02]: What else?

2026
02:41:08,217 --> 02:41:09,237
[SPEAKER_02]: Ah, now I lost my train of thought.

2027
02:41:09,257 --> 02:41:10,178
[SPEAKER_02]: Choo-choo, derailed.

2028
02:41:10,698 --> 02:41:16,381
[SPEAKER_02]: Is this the type of thing that he thinks should be televised or what?

2029
02:41:17,588 --> 02:41:18,268
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess we don't know.

2030
02:41:18,869 --> 02:41:19,390
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

2031
02:41:19,650 --> 02:41:25,679
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, this is just him making a comment and bloggers picking up on it and going, Oh my god, he thinks it should be a sport!

2032
02:41:25,980 --> 02:41:32,649
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, let's say it was the type of sport that you would see on The Ocho, or in all reality ESPN2 or something like that.

2033
02:41:32,769 --> 02:41:33,410
[SPEAKER_02]: Would you watch it?

2034
02:41:33,490 --> 02:41:33,731
[SPEAKER_02]: Nope.

2035
02:41:35,256 --> 02:41:47,788
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm curious, chatters, if Tetris was a sport and they broadcast the big showdowns live on ESPN or ESPN2 or ABC Wild World of Sports, would you watch it?

2036
02:41:49,250 --> 02:41:50,791
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess this all goes into competitive gaming.

2037
02:41:50,811 --> 02:41:51,452
[SPEAKER_13]: Human Tetris.

2038
02:41:53,474 --> 02:41:55,576
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, they did make a show out of that, aren't they?

2039
02:41:55,756 --> 02:41:57,337
[SPEAKER_02]: Isn't that going to be a show on Fox or something?

2040
02:41:57,658 --> 02:41:58,559
[SPEAKER_02]: It is already.

2041
02:41:58,579 --> 02:41:59,720
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's the wall.

2042
02:42:01,527 --> 02:42:04,349
[SPEAKER_02]: They did it as a gag on Ellen, like five minutes a week or something.

2043
02:42:04,369 --> 02:42:05,530
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it was in Japan.

2044
02:42:05,590 --> 02:42:10,994
[SPEAKER_03]: It's an actual show in Japan, and they do it for fun there, but, you know, we have to do it for prizes.

2045
02:42:11,655 --> 02:42:13,156
[SPEAKER_03]: No such thing as fun in game shows.

2046
02:42:14,257 --> 02:42:20,462
[SPEAKER_02]: Osfer in chat says, I go to Ohio tournaments often, and I can say that DDR is definitely competitive enough to be an Olympic sport.

2047
02:42:21,682 --> 02:42:26,266
[SPEAKER_02]: Chat.orangeentrader.com Kay Lefster says, Watching Tetris is like watching golf.

2048
02:42:26,506 --> 02:42:27,187
[SPEAKER_02]: So, no.

2049
02:42:27,995 --> 02:42:29,896
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a whole channel dedicated to golf though, mind you.

2050
02:42:29,936 --> 02:42:30,417
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.

2051
02:42:30,597 --> 02:42:31,217
[SPEAKER_02]: A whole channel.

2052
02:42:32,238 --> 02:42:38,902
[SPEAKER_03]: It just wouldn't be something that, I mean, it's hard to make it interesting, I guess.

2053
02:42:38,922 --> 02:42:43,165
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're going to say no to that though, what about competitive gaming on TV?

2054
02:42:43,225 --> 02:42:45,266
[SPEAKER_02]: Should we just not have competitive gaming on TV then?

2055
02:42:45,606 --> 02:42:52,531
[SPEAKER_02]: Like the Counter-Strike tournaments and whatever the first person shooter hit of the week happens to be that they're playing online?

2056
02:42:52,851 --> 02:42:54,192
[SPEAKER_02]: Should they not be televised either?

2057
02:42:54,452 --> 02:42:57,133
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I don't think it's an issue of them being televised at all.

2058
02:42:57,273 --> 02:42:59,954
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just a way of how we're able to capture it and film it.

2059
02:43:00,534 --> 02:43:06,396
[SPEAKER_03]: Sports, that's easy to televise because usually all the gameplay and stuff is going on in one area.

2060
02:43:06,476 --> 02:43:09,638
[SPEAKER_03]: You can zoom back to catch the whole field and stuff like that.

2061
02:43:10,078 --> 02:43:12,659
[SPEAKER_03]: Doing Counter-Strike, you can't really film that.

2062
02:43:12,959 --> 02:43:17,961
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no way that you can see everything that's going on all at once because of the nature of the game it is.

2063
02:43:18,041 --> 02:43:20,242
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to focus on the different players and stuff.

2064
02:43:20,522 --> 02:43:20,802
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess...

2065
02:43:22,014 --> 02:43:46,612
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, it's a, you know, NASCAR, you can kind of do that kind of stuff where you can film the whole pack of cars and stuff, but they do, like, the in-car camps and that kind of thing, but, um, it's just, it's hard to film it and make it interesting in the same way as, like, a football game or a baseball game or something like that where they've been doing it for years and they've figured out, you know, they have commentators and know what they're talking about and stuff like that, but it's like...

2066
02:43:47,858 --> 02:43:57,786
[SPEAKER_03]: If you started filming Counter-Strike or something like that, and you started talking about it, and you had commentators going, I don't know who these people are.

2067
02:43:58,127 --> 02:44:05,913
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm aware that Counter-Strike exists and what it basically is, but I don't know who any of these players are, and this wouldn't really be interesting to me.

2068
02:44:07,234 --> 02:44:07,614
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

2069
02:44:07,735 --> 02:44:14,020
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just really tough to broadcast this stuff, and you're not going to get the same responses like...

2070
02:44:15,180 --> 02:44:18,701
[SPEAKER_02]: The Rob D in chat makes a comment.

2071
02:44:20,041 --> 02:44:20,421
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.

2072
02:44:20,481 --> 02:44:22,042
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the problem with competitive gaming.

2073
02:44:22,102 --> 02:44:23,422
[SPEAKER_02]: How many different things can happen?

2074
02:44:23,822 --> 02:44:26,823
[SPEAKER_02]: In football, you might see something that you've never seen before every week.

2075
02:44:27,643 --> 02:44:29,664
[SPEAKER_02]: In DDR, the participants aren't even interacting.

2076
02:44:29,704 --> 02:44:31,284
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a matter of seeing who scores the most.

2077
02:44:31,684 --> 02:44:34,845
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it would take a lot more animations and reactions to make it more interesting.

2078
02:44:34,945 --> 02:44:37,085
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's hard, too, with a fighting game or something.

2079
02:44:37,405 --> 02:44:39,686
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the fighting game would be the easiest thing to...

2080
02:44:40,206 --> 02:44:43,830
[SPEAKER_03]: Film, because it's all one screen, you can see all the action all at once.

2081
02:44:45,452 --> 02:44:49,857
[SPEAKER_03]: But the problem is, it's moving so fast, it's hard to commentate on that.

2082
02:44:49,937 --> 02:44:53,761
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't really commentate, whereas there's baseball, there's a lot of different...

2083
02:45:02,739 --> 02:45:03,519
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for watching!

2084
02:45:29,064 --> 02:45:31,526
[SPEAKER_02]: Also a lot of talk about that old show Arena on G4.

2085
02:45:31,546 --> 02:45:33,728
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of fans of that show in our chat room right now.

2086
02:45:34,248 --> 02:45:35,389
[SPEAKER_02]: I wasn't that big on Arena.

2087
02:45:35,429 --> 02:45:35,889
[SPEAKER_02]: You know why?

2088
02:45:35,909 --> 02:45:37,431
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it was so heavily edited.

2089
02:45:37,851 --> 02:45:39,912
[SPEAKER_02]: You were only really seeing the highlights of every match.

2090
02:45:40,413 --> 02:45:45,216
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't know, I felt like I didn't learn enough about the game and the actual strategy and how to get better from just seeing.

2091
02:45:45,256 --> 02:45:49,359
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was so fast, the way they went back and forth from all the different pieces.

2092
02:45:49,439 --> 02:45:53,082
[SPEAKER_02]: I never felt like I really understood what was going on watching that show.

2093
02:45:53,723 --> 02:45:56,945
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe it's just because I'm not into first person shooters as much as I am other games, but...

2094
02:45:57,826 --> 02:46:08,153
[SPEAKER_03]: See, they could do something, I don't even know if a game exists out there like that, but like Call of Duty 4, actually this would be more like Operation Flashpoint 2, I think, because it's more open world.

2095
02:46:08,473 --> 02:46:12,597
[SPEAKER_03]: But you could do something where you have two different teams, you could show them strategizing you.

2096
02:46:13,457 --> 02:46:16,258
[SPEAKER_03]: about the game beforehand, you know, planning out stuff.

2097
02:46:16,498 --> 02:46:27,239
[SPEAKER_03]: They could talk about the different possibilities, how they may be able to, like, okay, you know, team, you know, the red team right here can, you know, go down flank under this, you know, through this valley or something like that, you know, but then they have to watch out.

2098
02:46:27,279 --> 02:46:33,200
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's a lot of commentary and, like, visual aids that they could do there, but it's just, it's really tough.

2099
02:46:34,401 --> 02:46:41,262
[SPEAKER_03]: Once again, and I pretty much stress this almost every sentence now, it's really tough to film this stuff, to make it interesting.

2100
02:46:41,522 --> 02:46:41,862
[SPEAKER_03]: You just...

2101
02:46:43,720 --> 02:46:44,040
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

2102
02:46:44,901 --> 02:47:00,215
[SPEAKER_03]: Unless it's like a NASCAR game or like Project Gotham would kind of work because they had the spectator mode where you can actually watch the cars and stuff racing around almost like as you were watching a television production of a race.

2103
02:47:00,615 --> 02:47:04,999
[SPEAKER_03]: So you could do something similar like that and that might work as far as commentary and stuff goes.

2104
02:47:05,399 --> 02:47:11,627
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if first person shooters are really going to work because it's so massive and there's so much stuff going on.

2105
02:47:22,089 --> 02:47:25,551
[SPEAKER_02]: SSJ100 Matt says this, and then we're going to move on towards the end of the show here.

2106
02:47:26,191 --> 02:47:31,214
[SPEAKER_02]: The fact is, statistics and ratings show people don't really care for watching people playing video games.

2107
02:47:31,874 --> 02:47:34,776
[SPEAKER_02]: Yet StarCraft televised competitions works in Korea.

2108
02:47:35,816 --> 02:47:44,380
[SPEAKER_02]: TigerClaw in chat says the problem with showing live gameplay of Attorney is the action can get very repetitive and the average viewer will get bored by it.

2109
02:47:44,720 --> 02:47:47,362
[SPEAKER_02]: While us gamers are used to seeing the repetitiveness of the games.

2110
02:47:48,262 --> 02:47:49,163
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, we're going to leave it there.

2111
02:47:49,203 --> 02:47:50,903
[SPEAKER_02]: If you have further comments you can always send us an email.

2112
02:47:50,943 --> 02:47:55,786
[SPEAKER_02]: Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com But we want to get to the FUs of the week.

2113
02:47:56,006 --> 02:47:58,367
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course something has to inspire the FUs of the week.

2114
02:47:58,947 --> 02:48:01,889
[SPEAKER_02]: What better than a stupid gamer doing something stupid?

2115
02:48:02,469 --> 02:48:03,510
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2116
02:48:24,038 --> 02:48:27,759
[SPEAKER_02]: The older brother said the weapon automatically went off when the two fought over it.

2117
02:48:33,100 --> 02:48:42,403
[SPEAKER_02]: By the way, they're saying that it is unlikely the kid will be charged because he is under 13 years old and the entire incident appeared to be an accident anyway.

2118
02:48:43,183 --> 02:48:45,783
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the part that disturbs me a lot.

2119
02:48:46,604 --> 02:48:47,324
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, a lot.

2120
02:48:48,184 --> 02:48:51,745
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I realize he's a child, but...

2121
02:48:53,317 --> 02:48:59,499
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my god, like, not a mention of the parents, and like, what parent keeps a shotgun accessible to their 11-year-old?

2122
02:49:00,459 --> 02:49:02,039
[SPEAKER_13]: Obviously not, you know, a good one.

2123
02:49:02,279 --> 02:49:02,420
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh.

2124
02:49:03,820 --> 02:49:05,980
[SPEAKER_02]: This just gives gamers everywhere a bad name, too.

2125
02:49:06,040 --> 02:49:12,422
[SPEAKER_02]: I hate it when stories like this are picked up by video game blogs, too, because it's just kind of like, this really didn't have anything to do with video games.

2126
02:49:12,582 --> 02:49:22,345
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, they fought over video games, but, you know, maybe not so much the gamer blogs, but I hate it when the mainstream media picks up these stories, because it makes gamers look violent when this really has nothing to do with the video games.

2127
02:49:22,625 --> 02:49:30,988
[SPEAKER_02]: This has everything to do with just blatant stupidity and bad, bad, bad, terrible parenting.

2128
02:49:33,990 --> 02:49:35,050
[SPEAKER_02]: So with that, the FU's of the week.

2129
02:49:50,549 --> 02:49:53,332
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, DarkSakura, would you care to start us off with a rant of your own tonight?

2130
02:49:54,112 --> 02:49:55,253
[SPEAKER_13]: F you to not letting shit go.

2131
02:49:57,816 --> 02:49:58,156
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki.

2132
02:49:59,718 --> 02:50:07,865
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, F you to moving, especially my cat, which it's not really her fault, but she can't sleep right now because she's worried and doesn't know what's going on.

2133
02:50:07,905 --> 02:50:12,149
[SPEAKER_03]: Cats have trouble adjusting to moving places, so she kept this up all night.

2134
02:50:12,329 --> 02:50:15,272
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, and F you to myself for accidentally breaking the, uh,

2135
02:50:15,672 --> 02:50:24,841
[SPEAKER_03]: Waterline going to my fridge, causing it to drip, but in defense, I think it's broken before I messed with it anyway.

2136
02:50:25,822 --> 02:50:29,305
[SPEAKER_03]: But it cost me $175 to have a plumber come out this morning and fix it.

2137
02:50:31,056 --> 02:50:37,479
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, F you to people that you thought were great friends that seem to disappear off the face of the planet altogether.

2138
02:50:37,499 --> 02:50:46,723
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you know, it just kind of sucks, like, to be felt like sometimes you're being dropped like a hot potato, uh, in, I don't know, for whatever reason.

2139
02:50:47,383 --> 02:50:48,924
[SPEAKER_02]: So, it just kind of stinks, you know.

2140
02:50:49,644 --> 02:50:51,625
[SPEAKER_02]: Friends are supposed to stick by each other through thick and thin.

2141
02:50:52,345 --> 02:50:53,906
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes I get the feeling that's not happening.

2142
02:50:54,106 --> 02:50:55,347
[SPEAKER_02]: So, F you to, uh...

2143
02:50:56,247 --> 02:50:57,808
[SPEAKER_02]: Those general feelings of angst.

2144
02:50:58,488 --> 02:50:59,368
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope it's all in my head.

2145
02:50:59,508 --> 02:51:00,188
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all I'm saying.

2146
02:51:01,849 --> 02:51:02,149
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

2147
02:51:05,010 --> 02:51:07,571
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's move on towards the end of the program here.

2148
02:51:07,891 --> 02:51:09,992
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we want to get into the rapid fire news tonight.

2149
02:51:10,372 --> 02:51:16,214
[SPEAKER_02]: So just kind of going over some of the stories we didn't talk about more in depth, but things you might want to know about anyway.

2150
02:51:16,254 --> 02:51:19,035
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, you want to start us off with your share of rapid fire news tonight?

2151
02:51:19,727 --> 02:51:30,377
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, we've just had Green Day sign up for Rock Band, so we'll have 21 Guns, Know Your Enemy, East Jesus Nowhere from 21st Century Breakdown, which was not really a good album.

2152
02:51:31,698 --> 02:51:35,963
[SPEAKER_13]: Then we have Sam & Max 1 coming to Xbox Live for 1600 Microsoft Points.

2153
02:51:38,705 --> 02:51:40,107
[SPEAKER_02]: Good, more people will try it now.

2154
02:51:40,834 --> 02:51:42,014
[SPEAKER_13]: Yep.

2155
02:51:42,094 --> 02:51:47,196
[SPEAKER_13]: Also, World of Warcraft is slashing mount requirements so that you can get them at level 20.

2156
02:51:48,596 --> 02:51:50,997
[SPEAKER_13]: And epic mounts will be available at 40, flying mounts at 60.

2157
02:51:52,177 --> 02:51:52,717
[SPEAKER_13]: Whoopty shit.

2158
02:51:54,358 --> 02:52:00,939
[SPEAKER_13]: And then the new Zelda game, which there's not a whole bunch out on, though they're saying that it should include the Motion Plus.

2159
02:52:02,240 --> 02:52:07,001
[SPEAKER_13]: Actually, sorry, that it may require you to have the Motion Plus.

2160
02:52:09,488 --> 02:52:12,629
[SPEAKER_02]: Marissa Congusto in chat is actually commenting on the Green Day story.

2161
02:52:12,649 --> 02:52:16,031
[SPEAKER_02]: Green Day rock band, most of their songs are only three chords.

2162
02:52:16,651 --> 02:52:20,433
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you know, that would work, though, because the easy mode, you only have three buttons, right?

2163
02:52:20,513 --> 02:52:22,514
[SPEAKER_02]: So I guess they could just kind of line it up there.

2164
02:52:23,234 --> 02:52:23,734
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

2165
02:52:23,775 --> 02:52:24,655
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, Rapid Fire News.

2166
02:52:25,057 --> 02:52:34,641
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, so apparently Target is now offering gift cards with select MotionPlus games and Guitar Hero Smash Hits.

2167
02:52:35,281 --> 02:52:40,043
[SPEAKER_03]: Apparently if you, an ad that they had running, I guess the week of June 14th,

2168
02:52:41,764 --> 02:52:53,357
[SPEAKER_03]: It's showing that if you buy Tiger Woods PGA Tour 2010, and that's with Motion Plus, and Grand Slam Tennis, you will receive a $20 Target gift card.

2169
02:52:53,817 --> 02:52:59,103
[SPEAKER_03]: If you happen to buy Guitar Hero Smash Hits, you get a $5 gift card.

2170
02:52:59,183 --> 02:53:00,024
[SPEAKER_03]: So hey, that's cool, $5.

2171
02:53:01,705 --> 02:53:09,449
[SPEAKER_03]: Rock Band is getting some music this week with Spinal Tap and Evanescence.

2172
02:53:10,089 --> 02:53:15,012
[SPEAKER_03]: From Spinal Tap, the track pack is going to cost you $7 or 560 Microsoft Points.

2173
02:53:15,812 --> 02:53:21,255
[SPEAKER_03]: That includes Back from the Dead, Rock and Roll Nightmare, Saucy Jack, and Warmer Than Hell.

2174
02:53:21,915 --> 02:53:25,757
[SPEAKER_03]: Each of those can be purchased for $2 separately or 160 Microsoft Points.

2175
02:53:26,657 --> 02:53:27,998
[SPEAKER_03]: Evanescence pack is going to be $4.

2176
02:53:28,818 --> 02:53:41,374
[SPEAKER_03]: 440 Microsoft Points or $5.50 and that includes Bring Me to Life, Call Me When You're Sober and Way to the World and of course each of those can be purchased for $2 separately or 160 Microsoft Points

2177
02:53:44,216 --> 02:53:47,077
[SPEAKER_03]: EA has confirmed that a small team is working on Mirror's Edge 2.

2178
02:53:47,977 --> 02:53:48,698
[SPEAKER_03]: Big duh.

2179
02:53:48,758 --> 02:53:51,299
[SPEAKER_03]: Sequel for a game that was pretty fun.

2180
02:53:51,539 --> 02:53:53,199
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that going to be the name of the game?

2181
02:53:53,239 --> 02:53:53,859
[SPEAKER_02]: Mirror's Edge 2.

2182
02:53:54,380 --> 02:53:55,180
[SPEAKER_02]: Big duh.

2183
02:53:56,200 --> 02:54:01,142
[SPEAKER_03]: So, no surprise they're working on a sequel to a successful...

2184
02:54:02,728 --> 02:54:03,989
[SPEAKER_03]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

2185
02:54:21,568 --> 02:54:22,850
[SPEAKER_03]: that was behind it.

2186
02:54:22,990 --> 02:54:27,955
[SPEAKER_03]: They will be running the game I guess for a little longer so if you are in the middle of the game you can actually finish it.

2187
02:54:28,395 --> 02:54:35,783
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you don't care to wait for that I think the PlayStation blog has all the information as far as what's going on there.

2188
02:54:36,084 --> 02:54:37,966
[SPEAKER_03]: So check it out if you want to spoil it.

2189
02:54:40,749 --> 02:54:41,049
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

2190
02:54:42,069 --> 02:54:46,790
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, before we wrap up the show, we are going to open up the skyline and take your calls.

2191
02:54:46,830 --> 02:54:52,291
[SPEAKER_02]: But first, we didn't get to the classic game of the week in Part A. We've got to get that taken care of tonight.

2192
02:54:52,711 --> 02:54:55,631
[SPEAKER_02]: It just wouldn't be a week here at Orange Lounge Radio without the classic game of the week.

2193
02:54:55,992 --> 02:55:02,093
[SPEAKER_02]: So every week, DarkSakura likes to dig through the great archive of gaming and pull out a game that you people ought to be playing.

2194
02:55:02,453 --> 02:55:04,353
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the classic game of the week, and here it is.

2195
02:55:08,074 --> 02:55:09,254
[SPEAKER_02]: What should the kids be playing this week?

2196
02:55:09,693 --> 02:55:10,534
[SPEAKER_13]: Donkey Kong Jr.

2197
02:55:11,835 --> 02:55:12,355
[SPEAKER_13]: Seriously.

2198
02:55:13,676 --> 02:55:15,417
[SPEAKER_13]: It is seriously a classic game.

2199
02:55:15,738 --> 02:55:22,503
[SPEAKER_13]: It's one where Donkey Kong's little kid wearing a diaper has to go rescue Donkey Kong from Mario who has captured him.

2200
02:55:23,628 --> 02:55:38,374
[SPEAKER_13]: and basically you just climb on ropes and drop fruit on these mechanized little big mouth trap thingy thingies and then you have an electrical stage in different areas and it's actually supposed to be the guy

2201
02:55:42,836 --> 02:55:48,481
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, Steve Wiebe, um, had the highest score on this one, actually, and he did pass Billy Mitchell on this.

2202
02:55:49,763 --> 02:55:51,184
[SPEAKER_02]: So... The untold story.

2203
02:55:51,605 --> 02:55:56,109
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, I don't know that Billy Mitchell has surpassed it, actually, since then.

2204
02:55:56,430 --> 02:56:00,134
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, his, uh, score was 1,033,000 points, and Steve Wiebe got 1,001,039,800 points.

2205
02:56:05,819 --> 02:56:08,000
[SPEAKER_13]: I have this on several systems like the NES.

2206
02:56:08,100 --> 02:56:09,461
[SPEAKER_13]: There's actually a Game & Watch version.

2207
02:56:11,482 --> 02:56:13,503
[SPEAKER_13]: The NES version was the launch title in Japan.

2208
02:56:13,583 --> 02:56:15,604
[SPEAKER_13]: We've got it on a virtual console.

2209
02:56:16,184 --> 02:56:17,365
[SPEAKER_13]: There was an e-reader card.

2210
02:56:17,425 --> 02:56:18,585
[SPEAKER_13]: It was in Animal Crossing.

2211
02:56:18,705 --> 02:56:20,486
[SPEAKER_13]: So yeah, it's a pretty classic.

2212
02:56:22,727 --> 02:56:24,908
[SPEAKER_02]: This is one of the few Nintendo games I actually had.

2213
02:56:25,509 --> 02:56:30,031
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a combo pack that came out on the NES back in the day that was like both Donkey Kong Jr.

2214
02:56:30,051 --> 02:56:31,191
[SPEAKER_02]: games, and I had that actually.

2215
02:56:31,211 --> 02:56:32,552
[SPEAKER_02]: It was one of the first Nintendo games I had.

2216
02:56:33,052 --> 02:56:34,393
[SPEAKER_02]: So, that's cool.

2217
02:56:36,068 --> 02:56:37,048
[SPEAKER_02]: I play this on the Coleco.

2218
02:56:37,729 --> 02:56:37,989
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah?

2219
02:56:38,529 --> 02:56:38,989
[SPEAKER_02]: It's old school.

2220
02:56:39,230 --> 02:56:39,510
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?

2221
02:56:39,610 --> 02:56:42,111
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually kind of like this game better a little bit than Donkey Kong.

2222
02:56:42,152 --> 02:56:42,572
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know why.

2223
02:56:42,592 --> 02:56:50,197
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess I just like the whole concept of the vine climbing and that you kind of go faster if you're willing to go across two, but you go really fast when you slide down.

2224
02:56:50,657 --> 02:56:51,217
[SPEAKER_02]: It's interesting.

2225
02:56:53,019 --> 02:56:59,443
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, if nothing else to say on this game from DarkSakura, then that's going to do it for your classic game of the week, Donkey Kong Jr.

2226
02:56:59,943 --> 02:57:04,126
[SPEAKER_02]: on just about every freaking system ever made, but originally in the arcade.

2227
02:57:06,010 --> 02:57:07,470
[SPEAKER_02]: An old school Nintendo classic.

2228
02:57:07,530 --> 02:57:08,071
[SPEAKER_02]: There you have it.

2229
02:57:08,771 --> 02:57:13,412
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, we are going to open up the Skype line just a little bit for any open bar topics you guys have.

2230
02:57:13,432 --> 02:57:17,713
[SPEAKER_02]: 1-877-GAME-OLR or username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

2231
02:57:18,073 --> 02:57:19,293
[SPEAKER_02]: Anything goes right now.

2232
02:57:19,393 --> 02:57:28,375
[SPEAKER_02]: Anything you want to ask or comment on, whether we've talked about it in the show or it's something you think we should have covered that we didn't, now is the time.

2233
02:57:29,255 --> 02:57:31,336
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, I don't know if... Oh wait, never mind, we're getting a call right now.

2234
02:57:32,682 --> 02:57:33,542
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

2235
02:57:33,562 --> 02:57:33,883
[SPEAKER_02]: Who's this?

2236
02:57:34,663 --> 02:57:39,425
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, it's your local convention whore, DJ Ranma S. Hey, Ranma, are you calling in about a new convention tonight?

2237
02:57:40,105 --> 02:57:41,065
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, pretty much.

2238
02:57:41,566 --> 02:57:41,946
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course.

2239
02:57:42,026 --> 02:57:42,786
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, which convention?

2240
02:57:43,907 --> 02:57:44,667
[SPEAKER_11]: Anime Next.

2241
02:57:45,007 --> 02:57:45,507
[SPEAKER_11]: And how was it?

2242
02:57:47,128 --> 02:57:47,408
[SPEAKER_11]: Well...

2243
02:57:48,010 --> 02:57:55,893
[SPEAKER_11]: If you've been following my Twitter blog, I've been like not feeling it, not feeling it because there's been delays, guests canceling.

2244
02:57:55,913 --> 02:58:01,495
[SPEAKER_11]: But when I got there and got into the groove of things, it was fun and I really enjoyed myself this year.

2245
02:58:01,815 --> 02:58:02,556
[SPEAKER_02]: I have to be honest.

2246
02:58:02,576 --> 02:58:04,016
[SPEAKER_02]: I've kind of been off Twitter all weekend.

2247
02:58:04,036 --> 02:58:07,438
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been so busy just running from place to place doing – well, it's nice.

2248
02:58:07,778 --> 02:58:10,619
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't – it's nice having a social life.

2249
02:58:11,039 --> 02:58:12,540
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, I've just been so busy.

2250
02:58:12,800 --> 02:58:13,660
[SPEAKER_02]: I've kind of been off Twitter.

2251
02:58:14,640 --> 02:58:15,201
[SPEAKER_02]: But I don't –

2252
02:58:16,121 --> 02:58:44,906
[SPEAKER_02]: I know what you mean you know sometimes you're just kind of not in the mood but then you get there and it somehow all comes together like haven't you ever done that like there's been like a party and you don't really want to go but maybe there's like either a significant other or it's an important friend having the party or something you know yeah and you're just not feeling it but you're like all right I'm gonna go because I have to and maybe I'll stay for an hour then find an excuse to leave like I have severe diarrhea or something right but then you get there and you're like oh I'm actually having a good time and it just kind of seems to all come together like that

2253
02:58:45,953 --> 02:58:47,274
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's how it was.

2254
02:58:47,854 --> 02:58:48,054
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

2255
02:58:49,114 --> 02:58:49,635
[SPEAKER_02]: So, all right.

2256
02:58:49,775 --> 02:58:54,857
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, what about, you know, we're a gaming show, so I always have to ask you, how was gaming representation at the con?

2257
02:58:55,397 --> 02:58:56,217
[SPEAKER_02]: Was there good stuff there?

2258
02:58:57,598 --> 02:58:58,598
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

2259
02:58:58,678 --> 02:59:01,219
[SPEAKER_11]: First of all, they had a room just for a rock band.

2260
02:59:01,879 --> 02:59:07,142
[SPEAKER_11]: They had it projected onto a large wall, which was about 60 feet wide, pretty much.

2261
02:59:07,182 --> 02:59:07,322
[SPEAKER_11]: Mm-hmm.

2262
02:59:11,363 --> 02:59:14,366
[SPEAKER_11]: It was a dark room and I walked in and everybody was singing Living on a Prayer.

2263
02:59:16,147 --> 02:59:20,531
[SPEAKER_02]: Is this rock band room something where people would just randomly walk in and watch people play rock band?

2264
02:59:21,712 --> 02:59:26,856
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I mean you would wait your turn to play but at the same time there was chairs so we could sit down and watch them play.

2265
02:59:27,476 --> 02:59:29,538
[SPEAKER_11]: I bet you see a lot of great talent though.

2266
02:59:30,459 --> 02:59:31,400
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, definitely.

2267
02:59:32,741 --> 02:59:34,282
[SPEAKER_02]: Sort of like an anime idol.

2268
02:59:35,343 --> 02:59:40,087
[SPEAKER_11]: Something like that and also there was also a beta test for DJ Hero there.

2269
02:59:41,189 --> 02:59:41,809
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, really?

2270
02:59:42,469 --> 02:59:43,149
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, really.

2271
02:59:43,850 --> 02:59:46,030
[SPEAKER_02]: So, wait, so you actually got to play DJ Hero?

2272
02:59:46,730 --> 02:59:48,471
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's called Beatmania 2DX.

2273
02:59:50,391 --> 02:59:51,731
[SPEAKER_02]: Ba-dum-bum, nice.

2274
02:59:52,371 --> 02:59:53,772
[SPEAKER_02]: Wait, hold on, though, Ranma.

2275
02:59:54,472 --> 02:59:57,672
[SPEAKER_02]: As I said this in Part A, the games have nothing in common.

2276
02:59:57,913 --> 02:59:58,553
[SPEAKER_02]: They really don't.

2277
02:59:58,593 --> 03:00:01,373
[SPEAKER_02]: If you've got to make that comparison, Beatmania and Scratch.

2278
03:00:01,793 --> 03:00:03,754
[SPEAKER_02]: But Beatmania and DJ Hero, no.

2279
03:00:04,214 --> 03:00:04,974
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't work.

2280
03:00:05,134 --> 03:00:08,295
[SPEAKER_02]: There are two games that happen to use a turntable.

2281
03:00:08,855 --> 03:00:09,635
[SPEAKER_02]: They're so different.

2282
03:00:10,567 --> 03:00:21,598
[SPEAKER_11]: Here's the thing though, I wasn't the one that made the joke because I walked in, I saw the sign, I run over to the other side of the game room because I know one of the guys over there, I'm like, what's up with DJ Hero?

2283
03:00:21,618 --> 03:00:24,120
[SPEAKER_11]: He's like, no, it's 2DX dude, it's 2DX.

2284
03:00:24,160 --> 03:00:25,962
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm like, haha, funny.

2285
03:00:26,643 --> 03:00:27,984
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, so they made the joke?

2286
03:00:28,485 --> 03:00:28,845
[SPEAKER_11]: Uh-huh.

2287
03:00:28,965 --> 03:00:32,829
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, please encourage them to go listen to Part A tonight because I have some pretty strong words for them.

2288
03:00:33,820 --> 03:00:40,328
[SPEAKER_02]: I will, I definitely will alright Ranma, I gotta let you go to get more calls but thanks so much for your call and have fun on the anime circuit you got it

2289
03:00:43,654 --> 03:00:47,676
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see, I'm looking at, because the chat room is talking about Anime Next a little bit here.

2290
03:00:48,236 --> 03:00:53,118
[SPEAKER_02]: Legend of Zaku says, Anime Next was pretty damn lackluster compared to previous years, although the venue kicked ass this year.

2291
03:00:53,838 --> 03:00:56,559
[SPEAKER_02]: Osfer says, I can't wait until mid-July when I go to Otacon.

2292
03:00:57,160 --> 03:01:01,001
[SPEAKER_02]: And Rob D is pimping his panel called Games That Push Your Buttons.

2293
03:01:01,061 --> 03:01:03,142
[SPEAKER_02]: It is pretty funny, though, if you're going to Otacon, check that out.

2294
03:01:03,702 --> 03:01:04,883
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, you're on Orange Haunts Radio, who's this?

2295
03:01:04,903 --> 03:01:06,343
[SPEAKER_02]: Legend of Zaku.

2296
03:01:06,503 --> 03:01:08,324
[SPEAKER_02]: Zaku, I was just reading a comment of yours.

2297
03:01:08,384 --> 03:01:10,305
[SPEAKER_02]: Is this a call about Anime Next, or what?

2298
03:01:10,854 --> 03:01:12,214
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I was there that weekend.

2299
03:01:12,534 --> 03:01:12,674
[SPEAKER_07]: And?

2300
03:01:12,954 --> 03:01:19,216
[SPEAKER_07]: Even though I didn't room with Adam this year, but I managed to find enough cash to go and split a room with someone else.

2301
03:01:20,076 --> 03:01:25,217
[SPEAKER_07]: Even though it wasn't far from the venue, but I still managed to make it regardless.

2302
03:01:28,077 --> 03:01:33,358
[SPEAKER_07]: Just to touch up on what he briefly said, I kind of had a different experience this year in Anime Next.

2303
03:01:33,378 --> 03:01:35,679
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, the venue kicked severe ass.

2304
03:01:36,667 --> 03:01:37,428
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2305
03:01:52,501 --> 03:01:54,963
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd have been, you know, wasn't what I expected, but whatever.

2306
03:01:54,983 --> 03:01:57,504
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess we'll try for the next year.

2307
03:01:57,564 --> 03:01:58,865
[SPEAKER_01]: What was missing for you?

2308
03:01:59,005 --> 03:02:01,126
[SPEAKER_01]: Was the game room lacking or what?

2309
03:02:01,527 --> 03:02:02,847
[SPEAKER_01]: No, the game room was fine.

2310
03:02:02,907 --> 03:02:04,448
[SPEAKER_01]: That had nothing to do with it.

2311
03:02:04,468 --> 03:02:09,291
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just like, it wasn't, I don't know, for some reason, I wasn't really getting into some of the other panels.

2312
03:02:09,611 --> 03:02:09,912
[SPEAKER_14]: I see.

2313
03:02:10,072 --> 03:02:16,856
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, when I first went to Anime Next two years ago, I was really getting into an Adult Swim panel that I got in there and maybe a couple of Anime...

2314
03:02:17,813 --> 03:02:20,655
[SPEAKER_07]: But I wasn't feeling it this year, unfortunately.

2315
03:02:45,294 --> 03:02:49,616
[SPEAKER_02]: Do not let your friend host a panel because they are your friend.

2316
03:02:49,936 --> 03:02:56,178
[SPEAKER_02]: Unless that friend is able to produce and outline ideas like everyone should have to, knock it off.

2317
03:02:56,318 --> 03:02:57,538
[SPEAKER_02]: You're ruining your own con.

2318
03:02:58,839 --> 03:03:04,061
[SPEAKER_07]: There was a particular one that I wanted to go to, but it had to do with Bomani stuff.

2319
03:03:04,581 --> 03:03:10,523
[SPEAKER_07]: It was actually on Friday, but by the time I made it there, I had to take my roommate to the hotel and check it in.

2320
03:03:11,161 --> 03:03:14,927
[SPEAKER_07]: and GetFood, so I pretty much missed it by the time I got there.

2321
03:03:15,107 --> 03:03:17,170
[SPEAKER_02]: What exactly are those Bomani panels like these days?

2322
03:03:17,370 --> 03:03:18,212
[SPEAKER_07]: Damn, we're in trouble.

2323
03:03:18,232 --> 03:03:26,444
[SPEAKER_07]: I have no idea, but it was held on Friday evening, and I managed to arrive in the con at that time to get my badge, so it was a new award then.

2324
03:03:26,584 --> 03:03:30,546
[SPEAKER_02]: They were nice enough to let me sit in on the BomaniStyle.com panel at ASEN.

2325
03:03:30,606 --> 03:03:35,830
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, as cool as it was to be sitting with some of those folks, I really didn't feel like there was a lot to talk about.

2326
03:03:36,090 --> 03:03:42,734
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of the discussions focused around the concert that had happened the night before, which is cool for the folks that are into that type of music.

2327
03:03:42,814 --> 03:03:45,736
[SPEAKER_02]: I felt really lost or what have you because I haven't been following a lot of the new Bomani games.

2328
03:03:46,016 --> 03:03:49,098
[SPEAKER_02]: But when it came to actual talk on the Bomani games, like half of it was a joke.

2329
03:03:50,058 --> 03:03:50,498
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.

2330
03:03:50,739 --> 03:03:50,979
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway.

2331
03:03:51,039 --> 03:03:52,900
[SPEAKER_07]: Most of it, for, you know, I...

2332
03:03:53,280 --> 03:04:03,274
[SPEAKER_07]: Even though I wasn't actually there in Ace, and I could only imagine it's probably like insider info, probably like inside jokes, something that would... A lot of inside jokes.

2333
03:04:03,695 --> 03:04:05,417
[SPEAKER_01]: You had it anyways a minute ago, Zaku.

2334
03:04:05,457 --> 03:04:06,899
[SPEAKER_01]: Please go ahead with your anyways.

2335
03:04:07,780 --> 03:04:08,842
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyways, I would...

2336
03:04:11,028 --> 03:04:24,740
[SPEAKER_07]: DDRX apparently hit arcades last week, the first one being Gameworks in Chicago that managed to get the first new cabinet in the country.

2337
03:04:25,681 --> 03:04:28,543
[SPEAKER_07]: And from the initial reviews, horrible.

2338
03:04:29,888 --> 03:04:43,914
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's just put it this way, the fact that the cabinet itself managed to go down to $10,000 as opposed to $15,000 in previous releases, they pretty much cut many corners, noticeable corners.

2339
03:04:45,115 --> 03:04:55,579
[SPEAKER_07]: Laggy LCD monitor, a pad that's like half the thickness of the original one, the sensors in the arrows are pretty much

2340
03:04:56,841 --> 03:05:01,462
[SPEAKER_07]: They're just triggering or not even holding, just triggering spontaneously or not holding at all.

2341
03:05:02,082 --> 03:05:10,244
[SPEAKER_07]: Just a lot of bullshit on the part of maybe Betzen or Konami for that matter, just producing piss for new cabinets.

2342
03:05:10,844 --> 03:05:11,404
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?

2343
03:05:11,924 --> 03:05:12,865
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not surprised.

2344
03:05:12,985 --> 03:05:14,205
[SPEAKER_02]: Go back to last week's show.

2345
03:05:14,285 --> 03:05:17,606
[SPEAKER_02]: As far as I'm concerned, wheel that machine out to the barn and put a bullet in it.

2346
03:05:17,666 --> 03:05:18,086
[SPEAKER_02]: It's done.

2347
03:05:19,626 --> 03:05:24,027
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, at this point, people are just writing DDRX off at this point.

2348
03:05:24,648 --> 03:05:25,309
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2349
03:05:42,492 --> 03:05:43,693
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sadly not surprised.

2350
03:05:43,993 --> 03:05:47,134
[SPEAKER_02]: Zaku, we gotta let you go so we can wrap up the show, but thanks so much for calling in.

2351
03:05:47,375 --> 03:05:47,995
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, take care.

2352
03:05:48,175 --> 03:05:51,317
[SPEAKER_02]: They're a little fatter, too, and nobody likes fat.

2353
03:05:51,637 --> 03:05:56,019
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it just me, or does it sound like, and we're gonna turn off the Skype for tonight so we can wrap up the show, but thank you guys so much.

2354
03:05:56,039 --> 03:05:59,601
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you didn't get in, remember, you can always send us an email, mailbag at orangelaundry.com.

2355
03:05:59,621 --> 03:06:00,682
[SPEAKER_02]: We do want your voice to be heard.

2356
03:06:01,682 --> 03:06:02,703
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for watching!

2357
03:06:23,772 --> 03:06:26,434
[SPEAKER_02]: Thought I would say this seven years ago when this whole show started.

2358
03:06:26,494 --> 03:06:30,577
[SPEAKER_02]: And yes, we're coming up on our seven-year anniversary show in two weeks, believe it or not.

2359
03:06:31,478 --> 03:06:33,260
[SPEAKER_02]: This first show is June 23, 2002.

2360
03:06:34,601 --> 03:06:40,245
[SPEAKER_02]: I never thought I would say this seven years ago, but we've talked too much about DDR the past two shows.

2361
03:06:41,246 --> 03:06:44,008
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, that's how relevant it is right now in this world.

2362
03:06:44,048 --> 03:06:45,109
[SPEAKER_03]: We could bring it back.

2363
03:06:45,329 --> 03:06:46,070
[SPEAKER_03]: I could bring it back.

2364
03:06:46,110 --> 03:06:47,811
[SPEAKER_02]: They just didn't put the confidence in me.

2365
03:06:47,831 --> 03:06:49,813
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it's not going to happen.

2366
03:06:49,833 --> 03:06:50,453
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it would happen.

2367
03:06:50,473 --> 03:06:51,034
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, Loki.

2368
03:06:51,654 --> 03:06:51,934
[SPEAKER_02]: It would.

2369
03:06:51,994 --> 03:06:52,415
[SPEAKER_02]: It would.

2370
03:06:52,975 --> 03:06:53,695
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's not going to.

2371
03:06:53,715 --> 03:06:54,156
[SPEAKER_02]: It could.

2372
03:06:54,236 --> 03:06:54,816
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, it could.

2373
03:06:55,676 --> 03:06:55,936
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

2374
03:06:56,297 --> 03:07:01,459
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got to go around and get everybody's final thought and wrap up the show tonight and take care of it.

2375
03:07:01,519 --> 03:07:03,500
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, did you have any other last things you want to throw out there?

2376
03:07:03,520 --> 03:07:04,601
[SPEAKER_03]: We didn't even talk release dates.

2377
03:07:05,141 --> 03:07:05,641
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, my God.

2378
03:07:05,681 --> 03:07:06,021
[SPEAKER_02]: We didn't.

2379
03:07:06,041 --> 03:07:07,522
[SPEAKER_02]: Do we want to go over those real quick?

2380
03:07:07,782 --> 03:07:08,343
[SPEAKER_13]: We could do that.

2381
03:07:08,603 --> 03:07:11,524
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what happens when you try a new format is that you forget shit.

2382
03:07:11,584 --> 03:07:11,824
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

2383
03:07:11,844 --> 03:07:14,706
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, then, Loki, why don't you go over some release dates for the U.S.

2384
03:07:14,746 --> 03:07:15,366
[SPEAKER_02]: before we wrap it up?

2385
03:07:15,586 --> 03:07:29,673
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, well this week we've got quite a few games coming out, but some that you probably want to pick up, Ghostbusters, coming out on PlayStation 2, 3, Xbox 360, Wii, DS, and PS, maybe the PSP, yeah.

2386
03:07:30,955 --> 03:07:33,037
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right, not the PSP.

2387
03:07:33,797 --> 03:07:34,578
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see.

2388
03:07:34,798 --> 03:07:38,100
[SPEAKER_03]: Big League Sports Summer coming out on Wii and DS.

2389
03:07:38,600 --> 03:07:47,686
[SPEAKER_03]: Flower, Sun, and Rain, if you're a fan of the Killer7 and those types of games, but Grasshopper doing this one on DS.

2390
03:07:48,146 --> 03:07:49,026
[SPEAKER_03]: It's weird.

2391
03:07:49,107 --> 03:07:52,929
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually played the import of the European one, and it's kind of weird.

2392
03:07:53,769 --> 03:07:56,971
[SPEAKER_03]: Guitar Hero Smash Hits coming out on PlayStation 2, 3, Xbox 360, and the Wii.

2393
03:08:00,113 --> 03:08:18,591
[SPEAKER_03]: um if you're into more of the sim games Discovery Kids Parrot Pals and Diva Girls Divas on Ice on Wii and the DS um Monster Hunter Freedom Unite on PSP that's gonna be pretty awesome and that's pretty much it

2394
03:08:19,926 --> 03:08:27,613
[SPEAKER_02]: Japan's looking a little thin on the releases this week, but you do get a price drop on Metal Gear Solid 4 Guns of the Patriots on June 18th on the PlayStation 3.

2395
03:08:27,993 --> 03:08:30,615
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember, this is Japanese release dates I am reading right now.

2396
03:08:31,616 --> 03:08:34,979
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes they get cool stuff before we do, but right now they're not getting a lot.

2397
03:08:34,999 --> 03:08:38,342
[SPEAKER_02]: There isn't a single thing of note coming out on the Wii this week, believe it or not.

2398
03:08:38,422 --> 03:08:41,865
[SPEAKER_02]: And usually in Japan, even on a slow week, you have something coming out on the Wii this

2399
03:08:42,185 --> 03:09:04,495
[SPEAKER_02]: on the Playstation 2 you have a couple other price drops going on and mostly they are Neo Geo games like King of Fighters, Maximum Impact, Regulation A Metal Slug Complete, Samurai Spirits all of those games are getting price reductions and perhaps this is in preparation for the Sunsoft collection which is also coming out I think that's actually another price drop though they all get price drop, price drop, price drop this week over in Japan

2400
03:09:05,135 --> 03:09:07,657
[SPEAKER_02]: On the Nintendo DS, there is a Go!

2401
03:09:07,677 --> 03:09:07,857
[SPEAKER_02]: Go!

2402
03:09:08,397 --> 03:09:09,558
[SPEAKER_02]: 13 game coming out, believe it or not.

2403
03:09:09,578 --> 03:09:10,058
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember that?

2404
03:09:10,438 --> 03:09:11,999
[SPEAKER_02]: That was an old-school anime game that was on the NES.

2405
03:09:12,019 --> 03:09:13,220
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember we could make a moonwalk.

2406
03:09:13,280 --> 03:09:13,660
[SPEAKER_02]: That was funny.

2407
03:09:13,680 --> 03:09:14,001
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.

2408
03:09:14,241 --> 03:09:21,925
[SPEAKER_02]: They have a new one of those games coming out on the DS this week, as well as Nippon Golfers Kentai DS comes out as well, and some games from Level 5.

2409
03:09:21,965 --> 03:09:31,791
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure exactly if these are games we know over here, but Tago Akira no Atama no Taisu, Dai Wanshu, Nazotoki Sekai Isshu Ryoku comes out this week.

2410
03:09:31,851 --> 03:09:32,712
[SPEAKER_13]: I heard head.

2411
03:09:32,732 --> 03:09:32,852
Head.

2412
03:09:33,872 --> 03:09:42,494
[SPEAKER_02]: I think this is... It looks like some type of... You play in a hotel?

2413
03:09:42,594 --> 03:09:43,315
[SPEAKER_02]: Pirate ships?

2414
03:09:44,795 --> 03:09:48,096
[SPEAKER_08]: Pirate ship hotel.

2415
03:09:48,116 --> 03:09:49,696
[SPEAKER_02]: Looks like you're in a hotel or something.

2416
03:09:49,976 --> 03:09:51,837
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura's going to take a look at the name here.

2417
03:09:51,877 --> 03:09:52,637
[SPEAKER_13]: Professor Layton.

2418
03:09:54,457 --> 03:09:54,697
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh!

2419
03:09:54,957 --> 03:09:55,677
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, see?

2420
03:09:56,258 --> 03:09:57,338
[SPEAKER_13]: Leighton Kojo.

2421
03:09:57,358 --> 03:09:58,639
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, okay.

2422
03:09:58,699 --> 03:09:59,960
[SPEAKER_02]: It's Professor Leighton Games.

2423
03:10:00,080 --> 03:10:01,020
[SPEAKER_02]: New ones in Japan.

2424
03:10:01,040 --> 03:10:01,401
[SPEAKER_02]: There's two.

2425
03:10:01,501 --> 03:10:02,281
[SPEAKER_02]: Volume 1 and Volume 2.

2426
03:10:02,321 --> 03:10:02,521
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

2427
03:10:04,102 --> 03:10:05,103
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, now I see it.

2428
03:10:05,123 --> 03:10:08,505
[SPEAKER_13]: Because you were clicking on the pictures for the Leighton games.

2429
03:10:08,805 --> 03:10:09,605
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, now I see it.

2430
03:10:09,745 --> 03:10:10,005
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

2431
03:10:10,105 --> 03:10:10,986
[SPEAKER_13]: It's brain training.

2432
03:10:11,526 --> 03:10:12,127
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep, yep.

2433
03:10:12,647 --> 03:10:12,887
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

2434
03:10:14,721 --> 03:10:17,964
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go, new Professor Layton games coming out on DS over there in Japan.

2435
03:10:18,585 --> 03:10:26,753
[SPEAKER_02]: And quickly looking at the PSP, Fate Unlimited Codes Portable comes out this week from Capcom on the PSP.

2436
03:10:28,649 --> 03:10:30,550
[SPEAKER_02]: Dan is making arrangements for us, potentially.

2437
03:10:56,107 --> 03:10:58,289
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'm hearing we might move to where the pinball machines are now.

2438
03:10:58,529 --> 03:10:59,710
[SPEAKER_02]: He was giving me a little tour earlier.

2439
03:10:59,730 --> 03:11:01,412
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, the pinballs have to go to the garage.

2440
03:11:01,432 --> 03:11:03,013
[SPEAKER_02]: We might bump the pinball machines for the show.

2441
03:11:03,073 --> 03:11:03,634
[SPEAKER_02]: Could be interesting.

2442
03:11:04,875 --> 03:11:08,378
[SPEAKER_13]: But we did trade creatures from the Black Lagoon for Lord of the Rings.

2443
03:11:09,179 --> 03:11:10,520
[SPEAKER_13]: And Tan broke it already.

2444
03:11:10,660 --> 03:11:12,262
[SPEAKER_02]: I miss not having to commute, but...

2445
03:11:13,542 --> 03:11:16,263
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess if you guys have done it for so long I can do it for a little while at least.

2446
03:11:17,864 --> 03:11:19,564
[SPEAKER_13]: How about our European releases?

2447
03:11:19,644 --> 03:11:20,185
[SPEAKER_02]: How about it?

2448
03:11:20,685 --> 03:11:24,626
[SPEAKER_13]: On the 16th we have Wallace and Gromit's Grand Adventures Muzzled for PC.

2449
03:11:25,867 --> 03:11:29,068
[SPEAKER_13]: And on the 17th we have Rocket Riot, which kind of sounds a little dirty to me.

2450
03:11:30,028 --> 03:11:31,929
[SPEAKER_13]: The 18th Metal Gear Solid on PlayStation 3.

2451
03:11:33,030 --> 03:11:36,431
[SPEAKER_13]: And then the 19th we have Rock Band Unplugged, Virtua Tennis 2009, and Ghostbusters.

2452
03:11:41,038 --> 03:11:45,620
[SPEAKER_13]: Ghostbusters by the way I really like that infamous game really?

2453
03:11:46,000 --> 03:12:10,370
[SPEAKER_13]: yeah somebody was just asking a little while ago why we don't talk about it on the show I haven't played much of it just because I've had a whole lot going on you know but it's totally like between the guy coasting through the air with electricity and then being Spiderman it's kind of funny meets the guy from Crackdown I'm glad you said something about it I hope the listener who sent in that email listens to the end of the show so there you go

2454
03:12:11,380 --> 03:12:13,541
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, Loki, you had some other stories you wanted to get to.

2455
03:12:13,861 --> 03:12:14,161
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

2456
03:12:14,961 --> 03:12:21,782
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, what game out there could possibly create a peripheral that is 20 times more expensive than the game itself?

2457
03:12:22,223 --> 03:12:24,503
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that game, of course, would be Virtualon.

2458
03:12:25,243 --> 03:12:31,585
[SPEAKER_03]: They do have a $300 arcade stick that you can get for the Xbox 360 version.

2459
03:12:31,645 --> 03:12:36,226
[SPEAKER_03]: It is from Hori, and yes, it is 20 times the cost of the game, which is only $15.

2460
03:12:37,426 --> 03:13:02,912
[SPEAKER_13]: but it does have the twin sticks and you can go crazy with that I wonder if you know how they have those little converter units where you could use like a Playstation controller on the Xbox 360 you know the different ones you'd have to remap them and everything I wonder if there wouldn't be some type of converter that they could make where I could use my Dreamcast sticks I don't know then again I can just play it on Dreamcast

2461
03:13:04,400 --> 03:13:06,583
[SPEAKER_02]: This is going to sound so random, but I have to say something.

2462
03:13:06,743 --> 03:13:10,628
[SPEAKER_02]: I just realized you're wearing a DDRspot.com shirt.

2463
03:13:10,789 --> 03:13:11,510
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, I am.

2464
03:13:11,550 --> 03:13:13,092
[SPEAKER_02]: That is fucking old school.

2465
03:13:13,773 --> 03:13:14,914
[SPEAKER_13]: You know when I got this shirt?

2466
03:13:15,836 --> 03:13:16,096
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

2467
03:13:16,196 --> 03:13:19,300
[SPEAKER_13]: I got this shirt at March Madness.

2468
03:13:19,320 --> 03:13:21,023
[SPEAKER_02]: That shirt has to be as old as this show.

2469
03:13:23,161 --> 03:13:34,680
[SPEAKER_13]: I threw away the other day my DDR Mania X shirt I still have two DDR Freak shirts left too But now keep in mind, this is the thing, remember when I got this, it fit me?

2470
03:13:36,169 --> 03:13:37,890
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a 2XL.

2471
03:13:37,971 --> 03:13:39,031
[SPEAKER_02]: It's pajamas now.

2472
03:13:39,131 --> 03:13:40,332
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a sleepy shirt now.

2473
03:13:40,813 --> 03:13:41,073
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

2474
03:13:41,333 --> 03:13:41,934
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, good for you.

2475
03:13:42,454 --> 03:13:45,937
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a shirt I can wear without a bra.

2476
03:13:46,818 --> 03:13:48,559
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, thanks for sharing.

2477
03:13:49,400 --> 03:13:50,220
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, Loki, sorry.

2478
03:13:50,460 --> 03:13:56,365
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, with the news of Left 4 Dead 2 possibly dividing the community, maybe this will bring the community back together.

2479
03:13:57,346 --> 03:14:01,629
[SPEAKER_03]: Left 4 Dead has finally got a nude Zoe mod for PC version.

2480
03:14:01,729 --> 03:14:02,550
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, that's right.

2481
03:14:02,570 --> 03:14:03,331
[SPEAKER_03]: I read that.

2482
03:14:04,221 --> 03:14:07,923
[SPEAKER_03]: What game out there with a female character would not be complete without a nude mod?

2483
03:14:08,203 --> 03:14:10,084
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we can all agree on that.

2484
03:14:10,144 --> 03:14:12,085
[SPEAKER_02]: The nudity mods are a must.

2485
03:14:12,485 --> 03:14:16,087
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's available on L4Dmods.com.

2486
03:14:16,927 --> 03:14:18,808
[SPEAKER_03]: I gotta love this stuff.

2487
03:14:19,389 --> 03:14:20,549
[SPEAKER_03]: Nudity brings us together.

2488
03:14:21,029 --> 03:14:21,270
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

2489
03:14:22,890 --> 03:14:23,611
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see here.

2490
03:14:24,951 --> 03:14:25,592
[SPEAKER_03]: Apparently...

2491
03:14:28,456 --> 03:14:50,269
[SPEAKER_02]: Final Fantasy Tactics has been rated by the ESRB and people believe it's coming to the PlayStation Network sounds about right to me nice holy crap nice I've been so jonesing for the old school Final Fantasy Tactics like before it was on DS and all the other ones I really want to play like on my TV again Final Fantasy Tactics oh happy happy Rob

2492
03:14:51,394 --> 03:14:52,815
[SPEAKER_02]: PSP GO Apps and Small Games at Gamescom

2493
03:15:11,369 --> 03:15:37,259
[SPEAKER_03]: and these are supposed to be of course non-retail games and applications for the PSP and the file sizes are said to be limited to 100 megabytes but developers and publishers won't be limited in other creative ways Sony is said to have some specifically stated non-game apps and 2D tiles are more than welcome make your comparisons to iPhone now yes

2494
03:15:41,966 --> 03:15:48,893
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want to report on this, but apparently there is another teaser site in Japan now for a brand new Tingle game.

2495
03:15:50,094 --> 03:15:52,216
[SPEAKER_03]: And I weep with sadness.

2496
03:15:53,958 --> 03:15:55,079
[SPEAKER_02]: I weep tears of joy.

2497
03:15:55,380 --> 03:15:56,681
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for reporting that, Loki.

2498
03:15:56,701 --> 03:15:58,703
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, is that it?

2499
03:15:59,271 --> 03:16:13,645
[SPEAKER_03]: And finally, Nintendo apparently has, according to Guardian Media Technologies, was one of the patent lawsuits that Nintendo had to deal with.

2500
03:16:14,185 --> 03:16:15,346
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it's been thrown out of court.

2501
03:16:16,628 --> 03:16:29,646
[SPEAKER_03]: We are very pleased with the court's decision and Nintendo vigorously defends its patent lawsuits and at the earliest stages of this case Nintendo convinced the court to dismiss the case as Guardian's patent had nothing to do with Nintendo's products.

2502
03:16:30,612 --> 03:16:34,534
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, despite all the crap I give Nintendo, I think I agree with them here.

2503
03:16:34,554 --> 03:16:36,175
[SPEAKER_02]: There's too many of these frivolous patent lawsuits.

2504
03:16:36,195 --> 03:16:37,055
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, here's the thing.

2505
03:16:37,155 --> 03:16:46,860
[SPEAKER_03]: If there's a patent lawsuit that's out there, and they find that they have infringed on that patent, then how could there be multiple lawsuits later on for the same types of things?

2506
03:16:47,120 --> 03:16:55,844
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I think in that case, well, you've already found that you've been infringing on this patent, and you need to go after that person, because that's the person that has the patent for it, not Nintendo.

2507
03:16:56,744 --> 03:16:57,325
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's it.

2508
03:16:58,891 --> 03:16:59,151
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

2509
03:16:59,471 --> 03:17:01,972
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that's going to do it here for another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

2510
03:17:02,632 --> 03:17:04,013
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to get everybody's final thought.

2511
03:17:04,253 --> 03:17:05,773
[SPEAKER_02]: My God, the show just keeps going tonight.

2512
03:17:06,094 --> 03:17:07,014
[SPEAKER_02]: Three hours and counting.

2513
03:17:07,894 --> 03:17:09,035
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, your final thought tonight.

2514
03:17:09,215 --> 03:17:12,956
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to have to play some more Fuel, and then I'll have to play with you online with Fuel.

2515
03:17:13,556 --> 03:17:15,417
[SPEAKER_02]: My final thought is I am so down.

2516
03:17:15,457 --> 03:17:16,117
[SPEAKER_02]: Just let me know when.

2517
03:17:16,137 --> 03:17:16,637
[SPEAKER_02]: That'll be fun.

2518
03:17:16,757 --> 03:17:17,017
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

2519
03:17:17,237 --> 03:17:17,718
[SPEAKER_02]: Dark Sakura.

2520
03:17:18,058 --> 03:17:22,179
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't think a miracle from God could make Star Trek V a good movie.

2521
03:17:25,040 --> 03:17:27,241
[SPEAKER_02]: You do know they're on Star Trek X at this point, right?

2522
03:17:27,702 --> 03:17:34,019
[SPEAKER_13]: I know, but I was going back and reading 20 facts about Star Trek 10 from TrekMovie.com, which I will post in chat.

2523
03:17:35,322 --> 03:17:36,746
[SPEAKER_13]: Hey, but it did have the fan dance.

2524
03:17:37,501 --> 03:17:39,883
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyhow, that's going to do it for another week here at Orange Lounge Radio.

2525
03:17:39,923 --> 03:17:46,627
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, if you like what we do here for free every week of the last seven years of our lives, all we ask, tell a couple people about the show.

2526
03:17:46,928 --> 03:17:47,768
[SPEAKER_02]: Help spread the word.

2527
03:17:47,848 --> 03:17:49,349
[SPEAKER_02]: It's word of mouth that keeps us alive.

2528
03:17:49,730 --> 03:17:52,031
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you guys so much for tuning into us and supporting us.

2529
03:17:52,491 --> 03:17:58,155
[SPEAKER_02]: And we'll see you back here next week with more of Orange Lounge Radio and back here in two weeks for our seventh anniversary.

2530
03:17:58,195 --> 03:18:02,418
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't know if we're doing anything special for the seventh anniversary because the planning would have been... Is it really?

2531
03:18:02,698 --> 03:18:04,240
[SPEAKER_02]: Two weeks is our seventh anniversary.

2532
03:18:05,060 --> 03:18:08,302
[SPEAKER_02]: to technically it falls in between next week and the next Sunday.

2533
03:18:08,742 --> 03:18:09,462
[SPEAKER_13]: But you know what?

2534
03:18:10,963 --> 03:18:12,844
[SPEAKER_13]: I have my next assessment.

2535
03:18:13,904 --> 03:18:14,184
[SPEAKER_13]: You know what?

2536
03:18:14,204 --> 03:18:18,426
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm going to actually email the teacher and ask if I can go do the assessment earlier in the day.

2537
03:18:18,866 --> 03:18:19,607
[SPEAKER_02]: That might be a good idea.

2538
03:18:20,787 --> 03:18:22,068
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if we'll do anything special.

2539
03:18:22,128 --> 03:18:26,450
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just, you know, we always try to do something special for the anniversary shows and nothing ever really happens.

2540
03:18:26,470 --> 03:18:26,950
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's explode things.

2541
03:18:27,390 --> 03:18:27,650
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

2542
03:18:27,710 --> 03:18:29,291
[SPEAKER_02]: We want to explode things live on air and be fun.

2543
03:18:30,259 --> 03:18:31,799
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, well we'll see what happens.

2544
03:18:32,099 --> 03:18:34,960
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll be back next week with more Orange Lounge Radio.
