0	3000	Orange Lounge Radio
7000	13000	We're your hosts, DarkSakura, Sky and Loco UK
14000	22000	Tonight, June 28, 2009, we kick back and celebrate 7 years of Orange Lounge Radio with all of our listeners
22000	30000	Orange Lounge Radio
31000	36000	Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio
36000	40000	We are that video game talk show dedicated of course to video games
40000	43000	Video gaming, gaming culture and the gamer lifestyle
43000	46000	We like to say it's a place where every gamer has a voice
46000	50000	But it's going to be these three voices walking you through the next few hours here
50000	52000	When we tape live on all games radio
52000	58000	Myself, Rob Roberts and the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summer is here as well
58000	59000	Hi
59000	60000	How are you?
60000	61000	Beat
61000	63000	It's hot, it is hot in Sacramento today
63000	67000	It was 107 last time that I checked
67000	73000	And today was my walking evaluation, but we got to stay inside the air conditioning
73000	76000	Yeah, I was going to say, that's pretty cruel making me walk outside in the heat
76000	81000	Our teacher is like, there's no way in hell I'm making you guys go outside, we'll go break into the cardio room
81000	82000	Fun
82000	84000	And also say hello to Techmaster Loki
84000	85000	Hello
85000	86000	How are you doing Loki?
86000	87000	Good
87000	88000	Stay indoors today?
88000	90000	Yeah, I painted baseboards
90000	93000	Fun, being a homeowner rocks doesn't it?
93000	94000	Yeah
94000	95000	Awesome
95000	98000	And then I remember you said something about not being able to get shows
98000	100000	I'm sorry, stories for the show tonight
100000	106000	Yeah, because the internet was there, Comcast is working on improving their network in our neighborhood
106000	107000	I don't know what that exactly means
107000	109000	So your house is just broken right now?
109000	111000	Today at least, it's alright
111000	116000	Well hey guys, it is the seventh year anniversary of Orange Lounge Radio believe it or not
116000	118000	We've been talking about it for a couple weeks now
118000	120000	Kind of hyping it up a little bit
120000	122000	And sure enough, we started this little program
122000	126000	The very first episode was June 23, 2002
126000	130000	Which means this week we hit seven years of Orange Lounge Radio
130000	131000	And that's with no major breaks
131000	134000	I mean sure, a week here and a week there
134000	137000	I think maybe a two week break happened once or twice
137000	141000	But honestly, we've been running pretty regularly with no extended breaks
141000	142000	Through that whole time
142000	145000	So that is kind of an accomplishment
145000	146000	So we can admit it
146000	149000	We can take a minute to say
149000	152000	Thanks to all of you for helping make it happen
152000	156000	Because I'll tell you what, that very first show, the very first night, episode number one
156000	158000	We had twelve people listening
158000	163000	And now on AllGames.com, when we tape live, we get as many as thirteen
163000	164000	So we've really grown
164000	167000	No, I'm just kidding, obviously we have a little more than that
167000	169000	But it's just been great
169000	171000	You guys really have taken that to heart, what we say at the end of every show
171000	173000	To just tell more people about our show
173000	175000	And it's worked and we've grown a little bit
175000	179000	So thank you guys so much for helping us reach seven years of Orange Lounge Radio
179000	182000	Here's the funny thing about tonight's show
182000	185000	It's been a really crazy week for all of us
185000	187000	I think personally and everything else
187000	191000	Just like the show a couple of weeks ago
191000	193000	We didn't really prepare a list of topics to talk about
193000	194000	But here's the thing
194000	196000	Two weeks ago, we had E3
196000	197000	That made it easy
197000	201000	We had three hours to talk all about E3 and what happened there
201000	203000	Tonight, not so much
203000	206000	So we're going to just do it the old fashioned way
206000	208000	Because this is the way we did the show for many, many years
208000	210000	So we're going to see if we've still got it in us
210000	212000	And we're just going to wing it, folks
212000	213000	Here at Orange Lounge Radio
213000	214000	We're just going to wing it tonight
214000	218000	We've started assigning positions as if Orange Lounge was a starship
218000	219000	Yes, and what's your position?
219000	220000	Captain
220000	222000	What's my position?
222000	225000	First officer, because you have to talk to everybody and be my voice
225000	226000	What would be Loki's position?
226000	228000	Oh, Worf
228000	231000	We've given Loki's security officer position
231000	233000	Because he's the most aggressive of us all
233000	236000	And Jason is our ship's engineer
236000	239000	Deep Man kind of does that too, though
239000	241000	Well no, Jason would be like the engineer
241000	244000	Deep Man's kind of the person that would actually
244000	245000	Science officer?
245000	246000	Okay
246000	247000	He can be our science officer
247000	248000	Like data?
248000	249000	Data
249000	250000	Yeah
250000	251000	And then that means that
251000	253000	Because I was going to say that Tiara was our science officer
253000	255000	But I'm going to make her
255000	256000	Sulu
256000	257000	She's our Sulu
257000	259000	She can be our Sulu
259000	260000	Oh my
260000	262000	No, Deep Man can be our Uhura
262000	265000	Because he does so much communication stuff for us
265000	267000	He's our communications officer
267000	270000	So Sos could be our science officer
270000	273000	And then our Sulu is Misty
273000	274000	Okay
274000	275000	She can drive us
275000	277000	Now is there a farting officer?
277000	279000	Because we need Rice Princess to have a role
279000	280000	Chris is ship's lesbian
280000	283000	Official ship's lesbian
283000	284000	Okay
284000	285000	Would she be the Troy?
285000	287000	Rice Princess can be our check off
287000	289000	So she can scream at people
289000	290000	Okay
290000	291000	And
291000	292000	I like this
292000	296000	And do like our advanced calculations and stuff
296000	297000	But we need a ship's counselor
297000	299000	Now everybody in chat is screaming, you know
299000	300000	Who's going to be Quark?
300000	301000	Who's going to be Scotty?
301000	303000	Who's the doctor?
303000	305000	This isn't DS9, hello?
305000	306000	We don't have Quark
306000	308000	We have somebody called the doctor already
308000	309000	So I don't
309000	311000	The doctor would be the doctor, silly
311000	313000	Ship's doctor will be Sherby
313000	315000	Alright
315000	316000	Meow meow
316000	317000	Alright
317000	319000	She's ship's cat
319000	321000	Let's do what we used to do here on the show
321000	323000	And instead of talking just about games
323000	325000	Ooh, Patty and Sulu
325000	328000	Get away from the damn Star Trek for a minute
328000	331000	There's some folks that don't even like Trek listening to the show
331000	333000	Oh, Game Guru said that Loki's our red shirt
333000	334000	Hey, if you want to
334000	335000	That's not very nice
335000	339000	If you want to join the chat room and scream Star Trek obscenities with the rest of our chat
339000	342000	chat.orangelaunchradio.com is the place to be
342000	345000	When we tape live on Sunday nights at All Games Radio
345000	347000	At 6 o'clock Pacific Standard Time
347000	351000	9 o'clock Eastern Time right after the Bobby Black Wolf show on Sunday nights
351000	354000	Let's go around and hear a little bit about
354000	356000	I've been changed up a little bit tonight
356000	358000	Because you know what, we've been doing this 7 years
358000	360000	If we want to talk about ourselves a little bit tonight
360000	361000	Get away from the games a bit
361000	362000	We can do that
362000	364000	We're going to do how was your day, how was your week tonight
364000	366000	Not just, you know, throw games into it
366000	367000	I'm sure you've played some stuff too, but
367000	369000	Dark Soccer, we'll start with you as we always do
369000	371000	How was your day, how was your week?
371000	372000	My day was hot
372000	374000	And kind of crappy
374000	377000	Um, also I left something, oh here it is
377000	380000	Um, yes, to, I've been in a lot of pain
380000	383000	From my finger, so tomorrow I'm having surgery
383000	386000	Done on it at 7 in the fucking morning
386000	387000	On my day off
387000	390000	Because I'm now officially on leave from work for a month
390000	391000	Congrats
391000	392000	Aww
392000	394000	With disability pay
394000	398000	Um, but no really, I've needed my finger surgery done
398000	400000	I was supposed to have it done at the end of July
400000	402000	She's going on the dole
402000	405000	Well, I, they, they, someone cancelled
405000	407000	And so I was able to get it done tomorrow
407000	409000	And that is such a blessing
409000	410000	Surgery's important though
410000	413000	Yeah, it's a 30 minute procedure
413000	414000	I'm going to be awake through the whole thing
414000	415000	Oh my gosh
415000	418000	But I won't feel, they won't let me watch, bastards
418000	420000	So, anyway
420000	422000	Um, as it's, as it's going, um
422000	426000	I've kind of, it sort of really hit me kind of hard this morning
426000	427000	So I've been kind of pissy
427000	429000	Try not to be pissy, I've tried to stay in a good mood
429000	434000	But unfortunately, when you're pissy, there's not a lot that keep you from just being pissy, you know
434000	436000	So I'm supposed to go to a birthday party today
436000	440000	Because Julie's birthday was, um, Thursday
440000	442000	And yours was Friday, so happy birthday
442000	443000	Indeed it was, thank you
443000	444000	I'm sorry, I couldn't make it
444000	445000	That's okay, I didn't have a lot of stuff
445000	446000	I called you
446000	447000	Yeah, you did
447000	448000	And we've got plans later this week
448000	449000	Yes
449000	451000	And you need to meet the BF and all that fun stuff
451000	452000	So we'll, we'll take care of that later this week
452000	455000	Indian food while I'm high is a kite, that should be funny
455000	456000	Um
456000	461000	I just want to read from DJ Morpheus in chat, our old buddy who hosts, uh, Under Sedation Live
461000	467000	Which, you know, if there's one show that's been in existence longer than Orange Lounge Radio, it's Under Sedation Live
467000	471000	Now granted, they had some big breaks, but we got our big break on Under Sedation Live
471000	474000	I do not have to learn to play with myself with my other hand
474000	476000	That's why God made toys
476000	481000	Those are the kinds of things that, uh, DJ Morpheus will throw out there on Saturday nights right here on All Games Radio
481000	482000	Where he tapes his show now
482000	486000	I do want to also point out, he did say, hope they cut open the right body part
486000	491000	Cause that would kind of suck to go in there and then like, you know, suddenly you come out of there and you have bigger boobs
491000	495000	They could cut open the wrong body part and take out part of it, that'd be happy
495000	496000	Alright
496000	500000	Um, anyway, as far as, uh, my week
500000	501000	Yes
501000	502000	Um
502000	504000	I was at work
504000	506000	It kind of sucked
506000	509000	And I was in a lot of pain, which sucked too
509000	513000	And, um, I walked and I, um, yeah
513000	522000	Tell us a little bit about the condition, because I think, you know, you haven't talked a lot about playing games yourself on the show in probably the past six months
522000	527000	And, I mean, granted you've had some on the DSSF, but I think people don't understand that you have something up with your hand
527000	530000	Like you can't really do the controllers for very long
530000	531000	So
531000	535000	It actually, I'll tell you what hurts most about playing a game is, um
535000	538000	And by the way, um, I agree with Travis, he is our cue
538000	544000	Um, what, it's called flexor tendonitis
544000	553000	Um, so to translate it means that the, you know, when you flex your muscles, when you flex your fingers you're bending them
553000	558000	If you straighten them out you're extending, so it's in the tendons that bend the muscles
558000	562000	And, um, those muscles, of course, are in your forearm
562000	565000	And the tendons run from your forearm to your finger
565000	571000	And, um, it's my middle two fingers of my right hand, my, uh, my flipping off everybody because they suck finger
571000	574000	And my not getting married finger, which is the other hand
574000	576000	So, um, it's on my right hand
576000	582000	So, um, anyway, those, the tendons that when they attach to the muscles in your fingers
582000	585000	There's a sheath around them of, uh, of tissue
585000	589000	You know, some of the kind of holds it in place so that they don't bow out, you know
589000	594000	Like when you have a bow strung too tightly and the things start popping out
594000	596000	Um, it keeps the tendons in place
596000	600000	And what happens is I have swelling on my hand
600000	606000	If you look at your palm, up above the center of your palm where the, the really fleshy part is right under your fingers
606000	608000	Um, I have a knot on each tendon
608000	612000	And what happens is that if you imagine like a pulley
612000	618000	The knot gets caught on that sheath of skin going, on that sheath of tissue going into the fingers
618000	624000	And so when I try to straighten out my fingers, it pops, like it's shoving past that
624000	628000	Like, like you're trying to fit something into a tube that's too small for it
628000	630000	You know what I mean?
630000	634000	Uh, act deaf in our chat room says flex or tendinitis, it sounds like a DJ
634000	635000	A little bit
635000	639000	Well, um, that, that's really, I think the best way I can describe it
639000	643000	So what they're gonna, gonna do is actually, um, cut my hand open
643000	647000	And it's just like they're, like they, um, open two little flaps on either side
647000	656000	And they're gonna snip the tendon sheath so that, that lump will have, won't have that tight of an area to go through
656000	661000	Um, and what happens is that the tendon sheath will heal around the larger lump now
661000	664000	And, you know, most, it has a pretty high success rate
664000	668000	It's fairly, you know, it, it's a 30 minute procedure
668000	670000	I'm gonna be awake for it, they're just gonna numb it up
670000	672000	Um, DJ Flexer
672000	675000	So they're circumcising your hand?
675000	677000	No, I'm not having skin removed from it
677000	679000	They're just making a little cut
679000	686000	Um, but the whole problem as far as how it hurts is that now it's to the point that even when my fingers are straightened out
686000	691000	If I try to bend them, that lump, it's just so much swelling in my fingers
691000	693000	Cause you can actually see it on my palm
693000	694000	Well, I'm showing Rob
694000	695000	Great radio
695000	698000	But, um, but it, it's visible on my palm now
698000	702000	And it's just not very, it hurts a lot actually
702000	703000	It's really sore
703000	705000	And the place where the lumps are on
705000	707000	You know what they say about folks with swelled palms?
707000	709000	They hurt?
709000	710000	Nevermind
710000	712000	Oh wait, that's hairy palms
712000	715000	You know what they say about, about, about men with big, with big feet?
715000	716000	Uh, big socks?
716000	717000	Big shoes
717000	727000	Um, but, um, now, holding a controller now is me telling everyone right exactly where the, where the owies are
727000	735000	Imagine having a piece of hard plastic shoved against swollen tendon tissue for, oh, longer than ten minutes
735000	738000	Imagine not being able to bend your middle two fingers
738000	739000	It hurts to hold a fork
739000	743000	I can't hold, um, and, you know, you know I do graphic art and everything
743000	747000	I can't hold my stylus or a pen that isn't, like, a big child-sized fat highlighter
747000	749000	Or, you know, smelly markers
749000	751000	For longer than ten minutes
751000	753000	And it's really getting in the way of my life
753000	757000	So, I'm just gonna say, cortisone, I've had two rounds of cortisone
757000	759000	Two shots in each finger
759000	760000	I'm, I'm done
760000	763000	I'm ready just to have the surgery done and get it over with
763000	766000	Well this is like real trauma in the ER type of thing
766000	768000	Although it's not really an emergency, it's not bad
768000	770000	It's not a big procedure
770000	772000	It sounds a lot like what my mom had a couple years ago
772000	775000	She had her shoulder operated on and her shoulder was preventing her from painting
775000	778000	And I know that was really rough on her
778000	781000	Because, you know, she's older, she's past 65 at this point
781000	784000	She's long retired from, you know, being a preschool teacher and nanny
784000	785000	The stuff she did
785000	787000	She likes to paint, that's how she passes the time
787000	789000	So having to have that surgery was rough for her
789000	791000	But now she can paint again and she's really happy
791000	793000	So soon you'll be able to play games again
793000	795000	The shitty thing that I'm having to put back on because my finger hurts
795000	798000	I'm glad I never have to wear it again after my stitches come out
798000	802000	Although it is cool that you can flip people off just 24-7 with that thing
802000	806000	Yeah, because it's basically a splint that straps to my wrist
806000	809000	And hangs on the outside of my hand over my middle finger
809000	812000	So I can't bend it, it forces it to stay relaxed
812000	816000	Well I bet you can't wait for Project Natal because you won't need a controller for that
816000	818000	You can just wave your hand around like a lunatic
818000	820000	That would be fun
820000	824000	Well I mean supposedly I could do that with the Wii mode if I played left-handed
824000	828000	Which actually Wii games are surprisingly easy for me to play
828000	831000	Because I haven't really had to do anything, you know
831000	836000	But like today when we were doing our exercises I couldn't do push-ups
836000	841000	So actually I had to use a ball, a weighted ball, and do reverse push-ups
841000	845000	I couldn't do the rowing because I couldn't grip anything
845000	851000	It's really, I mean people don't really realize exactly how much they use their hands
851000	853000	Especially their dominant hand
853000	855000	Until you're restricted in it
855000	861000	And it was just like, I would just sit and just sketch, you know, for stress relief
861000	863000	Couldn't do it
863000	866000	I can't massage people except with my left hand
866000	871000	Which fortunately enough my primary client, all of her problems are on her left side
871000	873000	So that's fine
873000	878000	But you know, it's just, it's gonna be an adjustment
878000	882000	But I'm absolutely relieved
882000	885000	Well now were you able to get into any gaming at all?
885000	887000	Oh yeah, I'll play Sims, I can still play Sims
887000	889000	After my surgery I can still play the hell out of Sims
889000	891000	And screw everything else
891000	893000	The mouse is a thumb trackball
893000	897000	So I can still, I still have the use of my first finger and I can still use my thumb
897000	899000	Have you beat the Sims yet?
899000	901000	You don't beat the Sims
901000	903000	You do if they're bad
903000	906000	However, I made a Mii Sim
906000	909000	And the first thing I mastered was video gaming
909000	911000	Is that actually a skill in the Sims?
911000	913000	Yes, it's one of the hidden skills
913000	916000	You can just start playing video games and you can get up to level 10 master video games
916000	918000	What happens if you max out your video gaming skill?
918000	920000	Do you become like Fatality and you get your own line of video cards and stuff?
920000	922000	No, you just are awesome
922000	926000	But Sim Mii is a professional writer
926000	928000	And a hacker
928000	930000	Just because
930000	932000	Alright, well
932000	934000	Oh and I played Peggle
934000	936000	I'm glad to see Sims is going fun
936000	938000	I played Peggle on iPhone
938000	940000	Yep, on iPhone
940000	942000	I'm glad they did that sale
942000	944000	That motivated me to buy it
944000	946000	And for people who are using Linux
946000	950000	They're actually a pretty good version of Breakout on Linux
950000	953000	I'm running Linux Mint on my laptop
953000	957000	And I like it that instead of using the arrow buttons to move your
957000	960000	Your little bar around
960000	962000	You actually use the touchpad
962000	966000	It recognizes the touchpad and you can slide your finger back and forth to move your
966000	968000	Your little
968000	970000	Bounce bar
970000	972000	So that was pretty fun
972000	974000	I played
974000	976000	I was at Boston Market
976000	979000	And I was playing Breakout over Chicken at Boston Market
979000	981000	Nice, Chicken and Breakout
981000	982000	Yep
982000	983000	Awesome
983000	984000	I am done
984000	986000	Loki, how was your day? How was your week?
986000	988000	I'm tired
988000	989000	I guess
989000	992000	Today I painted baseboards because
992000	994000	It needs to be done
994000	996000	Because they're just primered white
996000	999000	I mean they look white but when you paint them it's a different color white
999000	1001000	If that makes sense
1001000	1004000	So that's what I did today because I have to work on the house stuff
1004000	1008000	And then this week
1008000	1013000	I was trying to perfect the perfect modifications to Grand Theft Auto 4
1013000	1015000	And we have a working set now
1015000	1017000	It's Absolute Chaos
1017000	1018000	I mean
1018000	1022000	There's explosions going off everywhere consistently
1022000	1026000	Basically we replaced a bunch of the weapons in the game
1026000	1028000	Starting with the
1028000	1032000	Desert Eagle now is a gun that shoots these little
1032000	1034000	Vortex
1034000	1037000	Blasts I guess that basically throw people into the air
1037000	1040000	Or cars or just whatever you fire it at
1040000	1042000	And um
1042000	1044000	So that was basically the first thing I created
1044000	1046000	Which was like a defensive weapon
1046000	1047000	And it works pretty good
1047000	1050000	And then we replaced the um
1050000	1054000	The Mac 11 with uh
1054000	1058000	It's a molotov launcher that fires lots of fire at people
1058000	1061000	And catches them on fire and cars on fire and you name it
1061000	1064000	Then the MP5 which is the other Uzi in the game
1064000	1067000	Now fires rapid fire grenades
1067000	1069000	And um
1069000	1071000	That just creates a ton of explosions
1071000	1074000	And then we replaced the molotov in the game
1074000	1076000	Because you get that in multiplayer still
1076000	1078000	But since there's a molotov launcher already
1078000	1081000	I just made it create this giant explosion
1081000	1083000	That doesn't do any damage but throws everything everywhere
1083000	1085000	So that's kind of fun
1085000	1087000	Real quick question from chat let me ask this
1087000	1089000	Chat.orangelandradio.com live on this Sunday evening
1089000	1092000	Loki is there any way we can download your mods
1092000	1094000	That's from SSG100 Matt
1094000	1097000	No I'd have to post a copy of the ISO on there
1097000	1099000	I guess I could post a copy of my modified files
1099000	1102000	Then you just have to do the modifications yourself
1102000	1105000	And then you'd have to build your own ISO
1105000	1108000	And then burn it off and then play it on a modded 360
1108000	1110000	But um
1110000	1111000	Yeah I could do that
1111000	1113000	But it's a lot of work
1113000	1115000	And then um let's see what else I do
1115000	1117000	Oh uh the
1117000	1120000	The M4 now fires a bunch of rockets
1120000	1121000	Which is kind of funny
1121000	1125000	But they don't exactly explode on impact
1125000	1126000	They just bounce around a lot
1126000	1127000	Which is kind of funny
1127000	1130000	And then um
1130000	1132000	Let's see what else
1132000	1134000	I think that's pretty much it as far as weapons go
1134000	1136000	It's just it's a lot of chaos
1136000	1138000	And then also the police car flies
1138000	1141000	And um like the bus
1141000	1143000	And the big vehicles basically are
1143000	1145000	Um pretty dense
1145000	1147000	And they'll crash through anything and go really fast
1147000	1150000	So it's just it's really mixing up the game
1150000	1152000	And it right now because I mean
1152000	1154000	We've been playing Grand Theft Auto IV since it's come out
1154000	1156000	And hell we've been playing Grand Theft Auto games
1156000	1158000	Since they've come out on the PSP
1158000	1160000	And they had multiplayer in them
1160000	1162000	So um
1162000	1164000	Yeah it's just it's really
1164000	1165000	Really fun
1165000	1167000	And I'm really looking forward to when they come out
1167000	1169000	With the two expansions on one disc
1169000	1173000	Like they're going to be doing sometime in I think October
1173000	1175000	And uh when that happens it's going to be awesome
1175000	1177000	Because not only will I be able to
1177000	1179000	Because right now I can only modify the um
1179000	1181000	Weapons that are part of the original game
1181000	1183000	Like everything that's part of the expansion
1183000	1185000	You can't modify because
1185000	1188000	Basically it will overwrite anything
1188000	1190000	With the stuff that's in the expansion
1190000	1192000	Um that's on the disc
1192000	1194000	And you can't modify the expansion
1194000	1196000	Because it's in a different file format
1196000	1197000	And that kind of thing
1197000	1199000	But when it's on the actual disc
1199000	1201000	Then yes then I can hack crap out of it
1201000	1204000	And I'll be able to modify absolutely everything in the game
1204000	1207000	Which will just be incredibly fun
1207000	1209000	Um so beyond all that stuff
1209000	1211000	Um I've been
1211000	1213000	You know just kind of unpacking
1213000	1215000	And
1215000	1217000	I don't know
1217000	1219000	I've really just been playing Grand Theft Auto this week
1219000	1221000	Because I haven't had time to play much of anything else
1221000	1223000	But I have Wii Sports Resort
1223000	1225000	The Japanese one for Wii Motion Pluses now
1225000	1227000	You were mentioning that the other day
1227000	1229000	When you were over at my house for the birthday party
1229000	1231000	And for some reason we never got around to playing it
1231000	1233000	I guess just we were
1233000	1234000	On other tangents or what have you
1234000	1236000	But have you had a chance to crack it open and check it out yet?
1236000	1237000	Nope
1237000	1238000	Oh sad
1238000	1239000	I don't know
1239000	1241000	It's all in Japanese so I mean
1241000	1243000	Well you should be able to crack your way through it though
1243000	1244000	I mean uh
1244000	1245000	Yeah
1245000	1246000	When does that come out over here?
1246000	1248000	In um July 26th
1248000	1250000	Damn it's a bummer we weren't still in the old studio
1250000	1252000	We could do a Justin TV thing
1252000	1253000	Yeah
1253000	1254000	We'll have to figure something out
1254000	1256000	Or we can still get it broadcast somehow
1256000	1258000	Kinda check that out before it's launched over here
1258000	1259000	Yeah it's no big deal
1259000	1260000	Yeah I mean
1260000	1261000	I think
1261000	1264000	With Wii Sports it's more a lot of people have a curiosity about Wii Sports
1264000	1266000	That are actually like looking forward to it
1266000	1267000	Have it pre-ordered
1267000	1268000	I don't know
1268000	1269000	I get the feeling our listener base
1269000	1272000	More curious about it before they're gonna plop down that kind of money
1272000	1274000	It's a good deal
1274000	1276000	I mean the game's gonna be pretty decent
1276000	1278000	And it's got 12 sports in it
1278000	1279000	Plus you get Wii Motion Plus
1279000	1281000	So I mean hey if the game sucks
1281000	1283000	At least you have Wii Motion Plus
1283000	1287000	And you know as much I had to buy my Wii Motion Pluses at GameStop
1287000	1290000	Just because that's where I ended up turning it into my game
1290000	1291000	So I had a lot of credit
1291000	1293000	And it was just games that I've had for a while
1293000	1295000	Or gotten free from work like
1295000	1297000	Really I'm not gonna play UFC or you know
1297000	1299000	I don't really give a crap about the Wheelman
1299000	1300000	So
1300000	1302000	Wait so the Wii Motion Plus is already out
1302000	1304000	Yes Wii Motion Plus is already out
1304000	1305000	Oh interesting
1305000	1306000	Because uh
1306000	1307000	There's nothing you can use it for
1307000	1308000	No there's three games
1308000	1309000	There's Tiger Woods 09
1309000	1311000	There's um EA Sports Grand Slam Tennis
1311000	1313000	And then there's also Virtua Tennis
1313000	1314000	Okay
1314000	1316000	2009 or 10 or whatever it is
1316000	1318000	That's right I remember the Tiger Woods game now
1318000	1319000	Cause that has some other feature doesn't it
1319000	1320000	It doesn't that also have
1320000	1321000	That's Frisbee Golf
1321000	1322000	Is that the person that has the Facebook
1322000	1323000	Or is that on Xbox
1323000	1324000	Um
1324000	1325000	That's on Xbox
1325000	1326000	That's
1326000	1327000	They're talking
1327000	1328000	I think that was just more of an example
1328000	1330000	That's not actually being done yet
1330000	1331000	So much news
1331000	1332000	Um
1332000	1333000	No but you can actually
1333000	1336000	Play Frisbee Golf and stuff in Tiger Woods
1336000	1337000	2010
1337000	1338000	So that's kinda cool
1338000	1339000	And then
1339000	1341000	Um
1341000	1342000	Yeah but anyways
1342000	1343000	So I bought mine at
1343000	1344000	Um
1344000	1345000	GameStop
1345000	1346000	And if you aren't using trading credit
1346000	1347000	Or you know
1347000	1348000	Happen to getting
1348000	1349000	You know free games that
1349000	1350000	Are really old and crappy
1350000	1351000	That
1351000	1353000	You're just basically
1353000	1354000	Pay with cash or something like that
1354000	1355000	Don't go to GameStop
1355000	1356000	Cause they're charging
1356000	1357000	$5 over retail
1357000	1358000	They're charging
1358000	1360000	$25 for the Wii Motion Pluses
1360000	1361000	They retail at
1361000	1362000	$20
1362000	1363000	They know it
1363000	1364000	They just figure people are dumb
1364000	1365000	And gonna buy it
1365000	1366000	And yes I was dumb
1366000	1367000	And bought it
1367000	1368000	But the only reason I bought it there
1368000	1369000	Was because
1369000	1370000	It didn't really cost me anything
1370000	1371000	Since I traded in
1371000	1372000	Games I got for free
1372000	1373000	So
1373000	1374000	Who cares
1374000	1375000	You know
1375000	1376000	And really yeah
1376000	1377000	I could have gone to GameCrazy
1377000	1378000	Or something like that
1378000	1379000	But
1379000	1380000	I'm just not gonna drive the extra distance
1380000	1381000	And then go to someplace else
1381000	1382000	Other than GameStop
1382000	1383000	So
1383000	1384000	Who cares
1384000	1386000	But I did buy the last two that they had
1386000	1387000	So that was kinda cool
1387000	1388000	Um
1388000	1390000	And then I'm sure I'll eventually use them
1390000	1391000	But
1391000	1394000	I just haven't gotten around to it yet
1394000	1395000	But uh
1395000	1396000	Yeah
1396000	1397000	Just that's pretty much
1397000	1398000	I have a lot of games
1398000	1399000	You know
1399000	1401000	On deck I guess to play
1401000	1403000	And I just haven't really
1403000	1404000	Gotten to it yet
1404000	1406000	But hopefully now I'm done messing with
1406000	1408000	Grand Theft Auto 4 for a while
1408000	1411000	Cause I've really modified all that I can modify right now
1411000	1412000	Um
1412000	1414000	That I even wanna mess with so
1414000	1415000	That's
1415000	1416000	Where I'm probably gonna leave that
1416000	1418000	And then maybe I'll get into
1418000	1421000	Red Faction Guerrilla or Arma 2 this week or something
1423000	1424000	Alright
1424000	1425000	Well let's see
1425000	1426000	I'll start with games
1426000	1427000	And get into personal stuff
1427000	1428000	Um
1428000	1429000	Let's see games I played this week
1429000	1430000	I've still been playing Fuel
1430000	1431000	I think I've played
1431000	1432000	I think I've played Fuel more than Loki has now
1432000	1433000	I know
1433000	1434000	I'm really
1434000	1435000	I keep wanting to go back to him
1435000	1436000	I've unlocked four zones now
1436000	1437000	Which is still nothing
1437000	1439000	I mean there's like 19 zones
1439000	1440000	There's
1440000	1441000	There's a lot
1441000	1442000	Of orange to peel
1442000	1443000	In Fuel
1443000	1444000	Uh
1444000	1445000	The world is so vast
1445000	1446000	How are the third and fourth zones
1446000	1447000	Cause what's the third one they unlock
1447000	1448000	Ah
1448000	1449000	The
1449000	1450000	It's in the middle
1450000	1451000	The Dry Run I think
1451000	1452000	Is the name of the third area or something
1452000	1453000	It's kinda towards the middle
1453000	1454000	It's to the right side of the first area
1454000	1455000	Okay
1455000	1456000	Uh
1456000	1457000	And then you unlock a fourth area
1457000	1458000	Right underneath that
1458000	1459000	I actually haven't played a lot
1459000	1460000	In the third and fourth areas
1460000	1461000	Because I'm still obsessively collecting
1461000	1462000	In the first two
1462000	1464000	And I learned about this little trick
1464000	1465000	That lets you use any car
1465000	1466000	In any race
1466000	1467000	If you hit the back button
1467000	1468000	At just the right time
1468000	1469000	When the race is about to start
1469000	1470000	You can actually play
1470000	1471000	SUV races with a bike
1471000	1472000	And so on
1472000	1473000	That's awesome
1473000	1474000	So yeah
1474000	1475000	I thought it was actually kinda cool
1475000	1476000	Um
1476000	1477000	It really helps in some of the races too
1477000	1478000	I guess you could say it's cheating
1478000	1479000	But whatever
1479000	1480000	Who cares
1480000	1481000	It's a glitch in the game
1481000	1482000	It's a silly game
1482000	1483000	You know
1483000	1484000	I don't think Fuel should be taken
1484000	1485000	seriously
1485000	1486000	But it's
1486000	1487000	It's big dumb stupid fun
1487000	1488000	Um
1488000	1489000	And the world
1489000	1490000	The world really is huge
1490000	1491000	Like you just
1491000	1492000	I can see though
1492000	1493000	Some of the reviews I've read say
1493000	1494000	You know
1494000	1495000	And I've talked about this game
1495000	1496000	It's probably going to my third week
1496000	1497000	Talking about this game
1497000	1498000	I don't wanna kinda
1498000	1499000	Reinvent the wheel here
1499000	1500000	But I think one of the most common
1500000	1502000	Negative things I've read in reviews
1502000	1503000	Is that
1503000	1505000	Yeah you have this big open world
1505000	1506000	But full of what
1506000	1508000	There's really not a lot in it
1508000	1509000	And I think
1509000	1510000	I kind of am getting
1510000	1512000	Getting to understand that point of view
1512000	1513000	A little more
1513000	1514000	I do find this game fun
1514000	1516000	I think a lot of the courses are pretty cool
1516000	1518000	There isn't a lot that really is
1518000	1520000	But at least in the first few areas
1520000	1521000	Have you gotten to any of the like
1521000	1523000	Weather things like tornadoes and stuff
1523000	1524000	Not the tornadoes and stuff
1524000	1525000	So that's where I'm hoping
1525000	1526000	I've seen
1526000	1527000	I've seen some screenshots of that
1527000	1528000	And that looks crazy
1528000	1530000	I did do a heavy wind type race
1530000	1532000	But all that did was kind of decrease my visibility
1532000	1534000	And put this weird filter on that just made it look like
1534000	1536000	Stuff was blowing in front of my car
1536000	1537000	And everything the whole time
1537000	1538000	It was
1538000	1539000	I don't know
1539000	1540000	Like
1540000	1541000	I
1541000	1542000	It's hard to recommend this game for
1542000	1543000	$60
1543000	1544000	But at the same time
1544000	1545000	I can't put it down
1545000	1546000	Like I don't know why
1546000	1548000	Like I'm obsessively collecting all the vista points
1548000	1549000	And all this stuff
1549000	1552000	Maybe it's because I'm not playing MMOs right now
1552000	1554000	But there's that MMO driving me
1554000	1556000	To obsessively collect things
1556000	1558000	That I don't really need
1558000	1559000	So here I am trying to
1559000	1560000	Like I've unlocked an achievement now
1560000	1561000	For getting 10 vista points
1561000	1563000	I think I'm up to like 12 vista points
1563000	1564000	And for some reason
1564000	1566000	That's like my big goal in this game right now
1566000	1567000	Is like okay
1567000	1568000	I gotta play the arcade races
1568000	1569000	Until I can get the doppler truck
1569000	1570000	That I can run into
1570000	1571000	To get the vista points
1571000	1572000	Because I want all the vista points
1572000	1575000	Because that's supposed to be the prettiest areas in the game
1575000	1576000	I'll tell you what
1576000	1577000	There is some neat stuff
1577000	1578000	Like one of the vista points
1578000	1579000	You remember how last week you were talking about
1579000	1580000	That you drive through
1580000	1581000	Like a forest fire
1581000	1582000	To get to one of the zones
1582000	1583000	Yeah
1583000	1584000	Well one of the vista points is like
1584000	1586000	On a hill overlooking that fire
1586000	1587000	So it's kinda neat
1587000	1588000	Huh
1588000	1589000	You usually have some really interesting areas
1589000	1590000	So
1590000	1591000	Um
1591000	1592000	Yeah
1592000	1593000	You know
1593000	1594000	It's such a hit and miss game
1594000	1596000	If you like arcade racers
1596000	1597000	Like I do
1597000	1598000	Like just big dumb stupid fun
1598000	1600000	I think you will get a kick out of this game
1600000	1602000	But I think fans of more realistic racers
1602000	1604000	Are gonna get driven nuts by this game
1604000	1606000	I will tell you the one thing that does drive me nuts
1606000	1607000	I installed fuel to my hard drive
1607000	1609000	And I think it's causing more crashes
1609000	1610000	Than ought to be there
1610000	1611000	Is that um
1611000	1613000	Like sometimes after I do a challenge
1613000	1615000	If I do a challenge right out of the camp
1615000	1616000	The game locks up on me
1616000	1618000	When I try to go back to free run
1618000	1619000	Really
1619000	1620000	The loading times are just
1620000	1622000	A little silly
1622000	1623000	You know you
1623000	1624000	You have to wait
1624000	1625000	When you move to a camp
1625000	1627000	And then when you load for the race
1627000	1628000	And then when you
1628000	1629000	You know
1629000	1630000	It's just like
1630000	1631000	I'm having to do a lot of unnecessary load times
1631000	1633000	Well the load times I think
1633000	1634000	For the races and stuff
1634000	1635000	Is because it's
1635000	1637000	Like warping you to a different part of the map
1637000	1638000	I get that
1638000	1639000	But why does it have to reload
1639000	1641000	When I change from one camp to another
1641000	1643000	If it's just a new menu
1643000	1644000	If I'm not gonna
1644000	1645000	Like
1645000	1646000	If I'm not gonna exit that menu
1646000	1647000	Well it
1647000	1649000	It's loading the actual area of the arc
1649000	1650000	Cause when you exit the menu
1650000	1651000	It doesn't have any load time
1651000	1652000	I don't think
1652000	1653000	Um
1653000	1654000	It just seems weird
1654000	1655000	The loading times are weird
1655000	1656000	But honestly you know
1656000	1657000	I don't
1657000	1658000	It's not a perfect game
1658000	1659000	It's
1659000	1660000	I'm
1660000	1661000	I am having fun with it
1661000	1662000	And I think that's what's most important
1662000	1663000	At the bottom line
1663000	1664000	I can be as critical as I want
1664000	1665000	Of a video game on these
1665000	1666000	You know
1666000	1667000	I've driven right through a tree
1667000	1668000	Like
1668000	1669000	There are some very big
1669000	1671000	Glaring bugs in this game
1671000	1672000	But I don't know
1672000	1673000	Yet I still have fun
1673000	1674000	Collecting all the stuff
1674000	1675000	I wish there was like a trick system
1675000	1676000	Or something in that
1676000	1678000	It's fun to drive the motorcycles too
1678000	1679000	Like you know
1679000	1681000	And despite the fact that there's this big world
1681000	1682000	Practically full of nothing
1682000	1683000	There are like these houses
1683000	1684000	That will have ramps on them
1684000	1685000	And you can like
1685000	1686000	Drive up the ramp
1686000	1687000	And fly off the house
1687000	1688000	And you're flying over the trees
1688000	1690000	There is some silly fun
1690000	1691000	Well all those ramp houses
1691000	1692000	Have like fuel on top of them
1692000	1694000	That you have to stop and get
1694000	1695000	Yeah
1695000	1696000	I usually don't stop for fuel
1696000	1697000	Like I'll try to run into it
1697000	1698000	If I'm driving by it
1698000	1699000	But otherwise
1699000	1700000	Yeah
1700000	1701000	It's funny when I play on Xbox Live
1701000	1702000	And turn Xbox Live on
1702000	1703000	There's like nobody around
1703000	1704000	Anywhere
1704000	1705000	Just because
1705000	1707000	I'm surprised they don't have a way
1707000	1708000	To turn that on by default
1708000	1710000	I think more people would be using it
1710000	1711000	If it was like Test Drive
1711000	1712000	Where it was on by default
1712000	1714000	You know what I mean
1714000	1715000	Yeah
1715000	1716000	Um
1716000	1717000	Let's see
1717000	1718000	Other games I've been playing this week
1718000	1719000	Magic the Gathering
1719000	1720000	I actually bought
1720000	1721000	Magic the Gathering on Xbox Live
1721000	1722000	Despite our little story
1722000	1723000	About it last week
1723000	1724000	And all the fun
1724000	1725000	I know
1725000	1726000	Dark Soccer is holding up the cards
1726000	1727000	We still have to have our duel
1727000	1728000	But you see
1728000	1729000	I need to remember how to play again
1729000	1731000	So that's why I downloaded the Xbox Live version
1731000	1732000	That was the little point
1732000	1733000	That we were going to play
1733000	1734000	Unpracticed
1734000	1735000	Oh my bad
1735000	1736000	Well I couldn't resist
1736000	1737000	I had to check it out
1737000	1738000	But um
1738000	1739000	Yeah
1739000	1740000	I mean
1740000	1741000	If you like the card game
1741000	1743000	It's a fairly faithful reinterpretation
1743000	1744000	I don't know
1744000	1745000	I
1745000	1746000	I still think
1746000	1747000	Nothing beats
1747000	1748000	The actual cards
1748000	1749000	For a card game
1749000	1750000	But
1750000	1751000	I guess they did a pretty good job
1751000	1752000	With the translation
1752000	1753000	I mean
1753000	1754000	You know what
1754000	1755000	Uno
1755000	1756000	I could make the same argument there
1756000	1757000	Uno's a card game
1757000	1758000	But it's still kind of fun on Xbox Live
1758000	1759000	Because you have the camera and everything
1759000	1760000	And I was surprised
1760000	1762000	Magic the Gathering has the camera built in too
1762000	1763000	I didn't realize that
1763000	1764000	So hooray
1764000	1765000	A game I can get used to
1765000	1766000	Out of my Xbox Live camera
1766000	1767000	I'm excited
1767000	1768000	Um
1768000	1769000	But yeah
1769000	1770000	The game itself
1770000	1771000	I suck at it
1771000	1773000	But I was able to at least beat the first guy
1773000	1774000	And uh
1774000	1775000	You know
1775000	1776000	It's cool
1776000	1778000	I was having a problem figuring out how to edit my deck though
1778000	1779000	It wasn't
1779000	1780000	It's not very intuitive in that regard
1780000	1783000	And I'm not looking forward to all the microtransactions
1783000	1784000	That I'm sure are to come with this
1784000	1785000	But
1785000	1786000	You know what
1786000	1787000	For what it is
1787000	1788000	And considering it's only ten bucks
1788000	1791000	When the card game itself can start to cost you a lot more
1791000	1792000	Very quickly
1792000	1793000	Uh
1793000	1794000	It's worth checking out
1794000	1795000	You know
1795000	1796000	They did put together the game very well
1796000	1797000	And for
1797000	1799000	A very freaking complicated card game
1799000	1800000	I mean
1800000	1801000	Face it
1801000	1802000	Magic the Gathering is complicated
1802000	1803000	And I think it says it best
1803000	1804000	In the
1804000	1805000	In the rules
1805000	1807000	That come up for some of the tournaments
1807000	1809000	In the Magic the Gathering game
1809000	1810000	Magic the Gathering
1810000	1811000	One of its unique features
1811000	1812000	Is that the cards
1812000	1813000	At one time or another
1813000	1815000	Break all the rules
1815000	1816000	All the rules can be broken
1816000	1817000	With the cards
1817000	1818000	In one way or another
1818000	1820000	That's what makes the game somewhat unique
1820000	1821000	And
1821000	1822000	To take that
1822000	1823000	And have to translate it
1823000	1824000	Into a video game
1824000	1826000	Into a logical flow chart
1826000	1827000	That relies on
1827000	1828000	Set rules
1828000	1829000	That cannot be broken
1829000	1831000	That's a pretty tough thing to accomplish
1831000	1832000	And they did a pretty good job
1832000	1835000	I did notice it did seem to flow a lot better
1835000	1838000	Than the old, old PC game
1838000	1839000	Which wasn't bad
1839000	1840000	I had a lot of fun with that
1840000	1842000	But it did seem like the game mechanic itself
1842000	1844000	Flew a lot better in Xbox Live
1844000	1845000	So I didn't play it enough
1845000	1846000	I need to play it more
1846000	1847000	But um
1847000	1848000	Early for
1848000	1849000	For an early review
1849000	1850000	I will say
1850000	1851000	I had a lot more fun with it
1851000	1853000	Than I was expecting to
1853000	1854000	As far as how was my week
1854000	1855000	How was my day
1855000	1856000	Um
1856000	1857000	Today was kind of neat
1857000	1859000	I went to Pride in San Francisco
1859000	1860000	Which is you know
1860000	1861000	Of course the big gay Pride parade there
1861000	1862000	They do every year in San Francisco
1862000	1865000	I used to not be a fan of gay Pride actually
1865000	1866000	Um
1866000	1869000	Because I hate how the media will show that
1869000	1871000	And that is the impression unfortunately
1871000	1873000	That a lot of folks out there have of gay people
1873000	1875000	Is that we're all drag queens
1875000	1878000	And we all like to run around in our g-strings
1878000	1879000	Uh
1879000	1880000	And you know assless leather chaps
1880000	1882000	You know wearing nothing but handcuffs
1882000	1883000	Um
1883000	1884000	And that is so not true
1884000	1885000	And uh
1885000	1886000	Definitely not me
1886000	1887000	Okay
1887000	1888000	That's for sure
1888000	1889000	Uh
1889000	1890000	Hey I don't have the body for that
1890000	1891000	So uh
1891000	1892000	You can thank yourselves ahead of time for that
1892000	1893000	And B
1893000	1894000	It's just not really you know
1894000	1896000	Sure I've done Rocky Horror Picture Show
1896000	1897000	For a long time
1897000	1898000	But the rest of that
1898000	1899000	You know the
1899000	1901000	The big stuff they do out there
1901000	1902000	I don't know
1902000	1903000	It's just not me
1903000	1904000	And I don't like the fact that it's
1904000	1905000	The impression that some people get
1905000	1906000	Because some people are naive
1906000	1908000	So I used to kind of have a problem with it
1908000	1909000	Because it was so excessive
1909000	1910000	But let me tell you this
1910000	1912000	In straight culture there's a lot of
1912000	1913000	Excessive stuff as well
1913000	1914000	I mean think about it
1914000	1916000	Pride is no different from
1916000	1918000	A Playboy mansion party
1918000	1920000	The girls next door
1920000	1922000	MTV's Spring Break
1922000	1923000	Thank you very much
1923000	1926000	How is that any worse than what goes on at Gay Pride?
1926000	1928000	It's really not
1928000	1929000	MTV's Spring Break is just as bad
1929000	1931000	As anything you're going to see in San Francisco
1931000	1933000	It's really
1933000	1935000	I mean I haven't been to the parade there
1935000	1937000	But I've been to the Castro Street Fair
1937000	1940000	Which I've heard has almost a similar reputation
1940000	1942000	And it was really
1942000	1944000	Not that crazy
1944000	1945000	There was some crazy
1945000	1946000	It's not that shocking
1946000	1947000	No it's just
1947000	1948000	So you might see
1948000	1949000	A topless lesbian
1949000	1950000	Oh my gosh
1950000	1951000	You see those in France
1951000	1952000	Walking down the street
1952000	1953000	You know
1953000	1954000	I saw a couple of dudes
1954000	1955000	Running around in some tight shorts
1955000	1956000	But you know
1956000	1957000	Topless lesbian
1957000	1958000	Sweet
1958000	1959000	Who?
1959000	1960000	Brigitte Nielsen?
1960000	1961000	No
1961000	1962000	You know what
1962000	1964000	And then I always see that argument
1964000	1965000	What about straight pride?
1965000	1967000	Well I mean like MTV's Spring Break
1967000	1969000	Is a little bit of straight pride
1969000	1970000	I think in a way
1970000	1971000	But also I don't think pride
1971000	1973000	Necessarily has to do with
1973000	1974000	Just being gay
1974000	1976000	I think it's about just being different
1976000	1977000	At all
1977000	1978000	Just being
1978000	1979000	Just being
1979000	1980000	Out and proud
1980000	1981000	That doesn't necessarily mean
1981000	1982000	Out of the closet
1982000	1983000	And all that
1983000	1984000	It just means
1984000	1985000	You are who you are
1985000	1986000	And you're damn proud of it
1986000	1987000	And the hell with what other people think
1987000	1989000	So I've come a long way
1989000	1990000	In kind of accepting gay pride
1990000	1992000	As part of the gay culture
1992000	1994000	And I don't feel the gay shame
1994000	1995000	That I used to
1995000	1997000	I actually do still agree though
1997000	1998000	With Patton Oswalt
1998000	2000000	Is that the gay pride parade
2000000	2004000	Should actually tour from state to state
2004000	2005000	And go everywhere
2005000	2006000	Instead of just the cities
2006000	2007000	Where you're not really shocked
2007000	2009000	By it existing
2009000	2011000	Like Tuscaloosa
2011000	2012000	Nice
2012000	2013000	So yeah
2013000	2014000	I did that today
2014000	2015000	And that was cool
2015000	2016000	Except for having to stand out
2016000	2018000	In the blaring sun for like two hours
2018000	2019000	Less cool
2019000	2021000	But you're in San Francisco?
2021000	2022000	It still was hot
2022000	2023000	I mean even though it's San Francisco
2023000	2024000	Right by the ocean
2024000	2025000	You have a nice breeze
2025000	2026000	It was still hot
2026000	2027000	What was kind of cool
2027000	2028000	Speaking of hot
2028000	2030000	Gavin Newsom walked right by us
2030000	2031000	He was like right there
2031000	2032000	And Victoria
2032000	2034000	Who hasn't been on the show in a long time
2034000	2035000	Gavin Newsom
2035000	2036000	He's the mayor of San Francisco
2036000	2038000	And he's going to be running for governor
2038000	2041000	In 2010
2041000	2042000	He walked right by
2042000	2043000	And Victoria exclaimed
2043000	2044000	Oh my god he's even hotter in person
2044000	2046000	I was thinking of someone else for some reason
2046000	2049000	No he's very controversial
2049000	2050000	But anyway
2050000	2051000	I'm not going to get into politics too much in there
2051000	2053000	But it was just kind of cool to see
2053000	2055000	Someone that a lot of people know
2055000	2057000	Right there
2057000	2058000	Let's see
2058000	2060000	The rest of my week outside of today
2060000	2061000	I'm going to be honest
2061000	2063000	I've had a very
2063000	2064000	Bipolar week
2064000	2066000	I've had a weird weird week
2066000	2068000	My birthday was Friday
2068000	2069000	Which was cool
2069000	2070000	Because you know
2070000	2071000	I got to see friends
2071000	2072000	And hang out with folks
2072000	2073000	And had a party
2073000	2074000	Which oddly
2074000	2075000	It's the first party I've had in like a year
2075000	2077000	Where rock band and sing star
2077000	2078000	Did not make an appearance
2078000	2079000	And I had it in my car
2079000	2080000	Shocking
2080000	2081000	Right
2081000	2082000	But I don't know what happened
2082000	2084000	I think just everybody was just kind of into
2084000	2085000	Just talking
2085000	2086000	And you know
2086000	2088000	The TV just hardly ever got turned on
2088000	2089000	But for music
2089000	2090000	On the cable music channels
2090000	2091000	So it was just kind of like
2091000	2092000	You know
2092000	2093000	Just kind of a different type of party
2093000	2094000	Which was cool
2094000	2095000	Um
2095000	2096000	Let's see
2096000	2097000	And um
2097000	2098000	As far as the rest of my week
2098000	2099000	Okay look
2099000	2100000	Like
2100000	2102000	What a crazy week it's been
2102000	2103000	Like um
2103000	2105000	Especially if you're a Hollywood celebrity
2105000	2106000	Right now
2106000	2107000	Right
2107000	2108000	And you might be wondering like
2108000	2110000	I wonder if OLR is going to be doing a tribute tonight
2110000	2111000	To uh
2111000	2112000	The uh
2112000	2113000	Uh
2113000	2114000	Michael Jackson
2114000	2115000	Or Farrah Fawcett
2115000	2116000	Or Ed McMahon
2116000	2117000	Or that infomercial guy
2117000	2118000	What was his name
2118000	2119000	Was that the Sham Wow guy
2119000	2120000	Billy Mays
2120000	2121000	Billy Mays
2121000	2122000	I don't
2122000	2123000	Obviously I don't follow this stuff
2123000	2125000	I don't stay up late enough
2125000	2126000	Um
2126000	2127000	But okay so he passed away
2127000	2129000	But see I've had a lot more weighing on my mind this week
2129000	2130000	Because um
2130000	2132000	Somebody I actually know
2132000	2133000	Who I don't
2133000	2136000	And one of the first questions I got asked about this was
2136000	2137000	Has she been on the show before
2137000	2138000	I don't believe she has
2138000	2139000	Um
2139000	2140000	Even in the few many years of the show
2140000	2141000	I think a lot of people
2141000	2142000	Um
2142000	2143000	That are on the show know of her
2143000	2144000	Um
2144000	2145000	Her name was Beth
2145000	2147000	And she passed away on Tuesday
2147000	2150000	Which sadly was also the anniversary of the show
2150000	2151000	And uh
2151000	2152000	She passed away from swine flu
2152000	2154000	Or H1N1 virus
2154000	2156000	She'd been in the hospital for 11 days
2156000	2157000	And uh
2157000	2158000	Unfortunately used to come to
2158000	2159000	Um
2159000	2160000	Complications of swine flu
2160000	2161000	Basically her
2161000	2162000	I don't want to get into
2162000	2163000	Gory detail
2163000	2164000	But you know her kidneys failed
2164000	2165000	Her lungs failed
2165000	2166000	It just
2166000	2167000	She was brain dead
2167000	2168000	And that was the end of it
2168000	2169000	So they um
2169000	2171000	You know had to do what they did there
2171000	2172000	And um
2172000	2175000	It was just kind of the whole things kind of weird
2175000	2177000	I don't really know how else to explain it
2177000	2178000	Surreal
2178000	2179000	It's very surreal
2179000	2180000	I haven't really
2180000	2183000	You know I'm not going to proclaim that I was Beth's BFF in the world
2183000	2185000	But I really respected this woman
2185000	2188000	And I saw what a motherly figure she was to all her gays
2188000	2189000	And just people in general
2189000	2190000	Not just the gays
2190000	2191000	But you know people in general
2191000	2194000	And just you know what an accepting fun person she was
2194000	2196000	She was always like the type that lit up a room
2196000	2197000	One thing I will never forget about Beth
2197000	2200000	Is she was the first person to tell me
2200000	2202000	When I was dating a certain ex of mine
2202000	2204000	She was the first person to tell me
2204000	2205000	You can do better than that
2205000	2207000	Rob you can do better than that
2207000	2208000	And
2208000	2209000	She was right
2209000	2212000	That's just her motherly instinct in her
2212000	2213000	And um
2213000	2215000	You know we lost a really great person this week
2215000	2218000	To something we don't really understand
2218000	2220000	Which is so weird
2220000	2221000	Because you know
2221000	2223000	And so many people have made fun of swine flu
2223000	2224000	Myself included
2224000	2225000	And just like
2225000	2227000	Oh the media is blowing out of proportion
2227000	2228000	It's this big epidemic
2228000	2229000	And you know
2229000	2231000	It's pandemic level six
2231000	2232000	And all this stuff
2232000	2233000	And you know a lot of us are kind of like
2233000	2235000	Well more people die of the real flu
2235000	2236000	But
2236000	2238000	All it takes is one
2238000	2239000	To really affect you
2239000	2240000	And uh
2240000	2241000	You know
2241000	2242000	Whether she was
2242000	2244000	She was the first person in Sacramento County
2244000	2245000	To die
2245000	2247000	Of H1N1
2247000	2248000	And it's
2248000	2251000	We still cannot comprehend the impact
2251000	2253000	They're having a memorial for her next month
2253000	2254000	July 25th
2254000	2256000	And there's a part of me in my mind
2256000	2257000	That
2257000	2258000	I don't
2258000	2261000	I'm treating this like a four year old deals with death
2261000	2263000	I'm like literally thinking in my mind
2263000	2265000	We're gonna go have a party
2265000	2266000	We're gonna go hang with Beth
2266000	2268000	They're throwing a fat party at Beth's house
2268000	2269000	It's gonna rock
2269000	2270000	But like
2270000	2272000	There's a part of me that still doesn't get
2272000	2274000	That she's like not here
2274000	2275000	You know
2275000	2278000	Because I think it's something that nobody understands
2278000	2279000	Like H1N1
2279000	2281000	That I'm not able to wrap my head around it this week
2281000	2282000	So
2282000	2285000	I apologize if I'm not
2285000	2287000	As sympathetic to some of these celebrities
2287000	2289000	That have passed on this week
2289000	2290000	Folks that have contributed
2290000	2291000	I don't think anyone blames you
2291000	2293000	Well folks that have contributed great things to popular culture
2293000	2295000	And so forth, etc
2295000	2299000	I realize they don't blame me in the same way I don't blame them
2299000	2301000	I'm a little sick of hearing about
2301000	2303000	All these folks in the media and so forth
2303000	2304000	I feel for their families
2304000	2306000	I feel for what they're going through
2306000	2308000	But I understand
2308000	2311000	I'm coming to terms with why the media shoves this down our throat
2311000	2315000	For the same reason why Beth was splashed over every local news station
2315000	2317000	Here in Sacramento
2317000	2318000	Is that
2318000	2322000	I don't want to get too deep here on a video game talk show
2322000	2324000	I'm sorry but this has been a lot that's been on my mind this week
2324000	2326000	Seven years we do what we want right
2326000	2330000	Death is something that we don't understand
2330000	2334000	We have a lot of reasons and things that we try to come up with
2334000	2335000	To explain it
2335000	2337000	That's religion right
2337000	2340000	But at the end of the day we don't really understand death
2340000	2343000	So when it happens
2343000	2345000	We do what we can
2345000	2349000	To try and I guess understand it
2349000	2351000	I don't know is there something you want to point out
2351000	2353000	I actually wrote a blog post about it after
2353000	2357000	Because the day that you posted about Beth
2357000	2359000	One of my good friends at work
2359000	2360000	We found out he died
2360000	2361000	That's right
2361000	2363000	And I found out that he had been a little sick
2363000	2366000	But was just going to go see the doctor because he was experiencing heartburn
2366000	2370000	But of course heartburn also was one of the first signs of a heart attack
2370000	2373000	And he didn't come in on Monday
2373000	2375000	And I actually was looking for him on Monday
2375000	2376000	We had been talking about Linux
2376000	2378000	And I was going to show him my laptop
2378000	2382000	And we didn't see him we didn't hear from him
2382000	2384000	He's always super good about calling in
2384000	2385000	He's like the man there
2385000	2388000	He knows so much about everything you know
2388000	2390000	And just completely fun to be around
2390000	2394000	And then Tuesday one of the people in his department
2394000	2396000	Called his sister
2396000	2398000	And so she sent her husband to go check on
2398000	2400000	His name is Pete
2400000	2403000	And went to go check on over at Pete's apartment
2403000	2405000	And found him dead
2405000	2407000	So
2407000	2409000	And I freaked out
2409000	2412000	And then of course that same afternoon is when I went in to have my consultation
2412000	2413000	So
2413000	2415000	But it's like I came home
2415000	2419000	It was I think I actually wrote up my post on my blog
2419000	2421000	And I'll link it in the chat if anyone wants to see it
2421000	2423000	Just about getting it all out
2423000	2424000	Because it's like you were saying
2424000	2426000	And my own belief is that
2426000	2428000	And this is again this to me I'm sorry for getting philosophical
2428000	2430000	It just happens
2430000	2431000	I don't think anyone singled out
2431000	2434000	I don't think that there's any sort of cosmic vendetta
2434000	2436000	I don't really believe in karma
2436000	2438000	I want to make this very clear
2438000	2440000	Because a lot of people even locally
2440000	2442000	And reading comments on news stations and stuff misunderstand this
2442000	2444000	I want to make some things clear
2444000	2446000	Beth did not go to Mexico
2446000	2448000	Beth went to Las Vegas but Beth did not go to Mexico
2448000	2450000	Beth
2450000	2452000	None of Beth's friends have this disease
2452000	2455000	Those that live with her those that know her have been tested for it
2455000	2458000	This is an isolated incident
2458000	2460000	She was healthy
2460000	2462000	Yes she was a little overweight
2462000	2464000	But you know what so were most of Americans
2464000	2466000	Welcome to the USA
2466000	2470000	She was a healthy, fun loving, happy individual
2470000	2473000	This has not been explained
2473000	2475000	This may not be explained
2475000	2477000	That's the weird thing about it
2477000	2479000	It happened
2479000	2481000	Here's honestly this way
2481000	2483000	That's really in my belief system
2483000	2485000	Disasters
2485000	2487000	Whether they be something like this
2487000	2489000	Whether they be a hurricane
2489000	2491000	Whether they be a flood
2491000	2493000	I don't think that it's any
2493000	2495000	Like God's punishing people
2495000	2497000	I don't believe that God punishes people
2497000	2499000	I think God's got way too many other things to do
2499000	2501000	To deal with our petty little problems
2501000	2503000	Honestly
2503000	2505000	And so I don't believe
2505000	2507000	That there's a great cosmic hand
2507000	2509000	In the disasters or the good things that happen in life
2509000	2511000	I think they just happen
2511000	2513000	They're not in motion to happen
2513000	2515000	They're not predestined
2515000	2517000	This is how it happens
2517000	2519000	She may not have had
2519000	2521000	A good immune system
2521000	2523000	As far as that goes
2523000	2525000	Some people
2525000	2527000	I've known people who have been
2527000	2529000	Almost hospitalized
2529000	2531000	From just plain old illnesses
2531000	2533000	I had pneumonia for three months
2533000	2535000	And it almost went in the hospital
2535000	2537000	I just really think it just happens
2537000	2539000	And the best way to deal with it
2539000	2541000	Is just accept that it happens
2541000	2543000	And remember the good parts
2543000	2545000	I want to thank the chat room for being so supportive
2545000	2547000	On our big tangent tonight
2547000	2549000	Blue 22 in chat
2549000	2551000	Death is the one topic that brings people together
2551000	2553000	That's very true
2553000	2555000	And some other folks sharing their own very personal stories
2555000	2557000	About this whole thing
2557000	2559000	And what's funny
2559000	2561000	The way Dark Sakura explains it
2561000	2563000	I don't want to belittle what she's saying
2563000	2565000	Because I think she's right
2565000	2567000	Is very similar to the way Sesame Street explains it
2567000	2569000	Of the generation you and I come from
2569000	2571000	Do you remember when Mr. Hooper died?
2571000	2573000	I do
2573000	2575000	That was a huge
2575000	2577000	Thing in television at the time
2577000	2579000	Because that actor who had played Mr. Hooper died
2579000	2581000	And they had to explain that to the children
2581000	2583000	Because I don't know how they do Sesame Street now
2583000	2585000	But back then they kind of taped it
2585000	2587000	Not live but
2587000	2589000	It was only a couple weeks behind
2589000	2591000	A little off the cuff too
2591000	2593000	So they had to explain it
2593000	2595000	And the way they explained it
2595000	2597000	The actor was so upset about it
2597000	2599000	Go watch this on YouTube
2599000	2601000	You want to see one of the greatest television
2601000	2603000	I am not fucking with you
2603000	2605000	This is one of the greatest television moments ever
2605000	2607000	Go look up
2607000	2609000	I watch this live
2609000	2611000	Go watch Big Bird and Mr. Hooper's death
2611000	2613000	YouTube Mr. Hooper death
2613000	2615000	You'll find it somewhere
2615000	2617000	And watch how they explain it
2617000	2619000	Because the way they explain it to Big Bird
2619000	2621000	Is that he's wailing
2621000	2623000	He's bawling
2623000	2625000	And finally the only answer that he'll accept
2625000	2627000	This is just something that happens
2627000	2629000	Yeah
2629000	2631000	Anyway
2631000	2633000	I don't mean to get too off the subject
2633000	2635000	But with the whole
2635000	2637000	Tributes to Michael Jackson and all this stuff
2637000	2639000	And all this stuff in the media and so forth
2639000	2641000	I don't really want to join in
2641000	2643000	But at the same time I understand
2643000	2645000	Don't get me wrong
2645000	2647000	The man made great contributions to popular culture
2647000	2649000	Say what you will about his personal life
2649000	2651000	His personal life
2651000	2653000	Unless he broke, well whatever
2653000	2655000	He is who he is
2655000	2657000	Let's leave it at that
2657000	2659000	But I think
2659000	2661000	The reason why everybody's talking about it
2661000	2663000	And the reason why it's in the media and all this other stuff
2663000	2665000	Is that
2665000	2667000	This topic kind of brings
2667000	2669000	People closer together
2669000	2671000	It kind of helps people try and understand
2671000	2673000	What cannot be explained
2673000	2675000	I mean
2675000	2677000	Who hasn't heard a Michael Jackson song?
2677000	2679000	Everybody has heard a fucking
2679000	2681000	Michael Jackson song at some point in their life
2681000	2683000	Unless they're deaf
2683000	2685000	You know what I mean
2685000	2687000	Even then you've probably seen him dance
2687000	2689000	Okay
2689000	2691000	You have somehow been influenced
2691000	2693000	By this guy one way or the other
2693000	2695000	So when somebody like that passes away
2695000	2697000	There's definitely
2697000	2699000	Everybody's going to feel that type of connection
2699000	2701000	Like oh I remember that song
2701000	2703000	Or oh I remember watching it on TV
2703000	2705000	And like I'm not going to get to see that again
2705000	2707000	Although that's not really the case
2707000	2709000	Because the nice thing about being an artist
2709000	2711000	Is the contributions you make live on
2711000	2713000	Forever
2713000	2715000	It feels like something that
2715000	2717000	And I'm not going to say
2717000	2719000	Because honestly once I got older
2719000	2721000	I didn't really care for his stuff too much anymore
2721000	2723000	But I had a Michael Jackson doll when I was little
2723000	2725000	You know I grew up that way
2725000	2727000	I had the Billie Jean poster on my wall
2727000	2729000	You know when I was little
2729000	2731000	It's when you have
2731000	2733000	An icon like that
2733000	2735000	That is a part of
2735000	2737000	What formed who you are
2737000	2739000	Even if it's a little part something that's been an influence in your life
2739000	2741000	When it's gone it's like
2741000	2743000	Oh
2743000	2745000	Oh you know it's that sort of
2745000	2747000	Huh feeling
2747000	2749000	Okay but with the infomercial guy that died today
2749000	2751000	I'm not understanding that one
2751000	2755000	Do people really truly miss him
2755000	2757000	That aren't his friends and family
2757000	2759000	Which I'm very sorry to hear about their loss
2759000	2761000	It sounds like it was a sudden thing
2761000	2763000	But it's a trending topic on Twitter
2763000	2765000	Like really
2765000	2767000	Was he really that influential
2767000	2769000	Like maybe I'm missing something
2769000	2771000	And I'm sorry I don't mean to offend
2771000	2773000	Keep in mind he spawned
2773000	2775000	A lot of funny
2775000	2777000	He was one of those things
2777000	2779000	Just like a 4chan funeral or something
2779000	2781000	I would expect
2781000	2783000	So I think it's just more like
2783000	2785000	Oh that guy
2785000	2787000	You know because you don't have
2787000	2789000	Him to kick around anymore
2789000	2791000	You know
2791000	2793000	Especially though for all the celebrity deaths
2793000	2795000	I was the saddest about Farrah Fawcett
2795000	2797000	Not because of her fantastic hair
2797000	2799000	And I think it's horrible though
2799000	2801000	To die of anal cancer
2801000	2803000	That's just
2803000	2805000	A horrible thing
2805000	2807000	If I try to watch her NBC special
2807000	2809000	I can't watch it
2809000	2811000	I get so choked up I feel like I'm gonna barf
2811000	2813000	But you know what I think the worst thing was
2813000	2815000	Is that she was gonna marry what's-his-name
2815000	2817000	We are taking this video game talk show
2817000	2819000	And really just getting way too deep tonight
2819000	2821000	Which is supposed to be celebratory
2821000	2823000	It's our fucking show
2823000	2825000	Guess what
2825000	2827000	There's no Santa Claus either
2827000	2829000	And the Easter Bunny was made up by
2829000	2831000	Pagans
2833000	2835000	Bobby Blackwolf our old buddy here
2835000	2837000	One thing to realize is that he was also on a reality show
2837000	2839000	On Discovery about pitchmen
2839000	2841000	And a lot of people watched that
2841000	2843000	Because it showed more about the way he was outside
2843000	2845000	Of screaming here's how to order
2845000	2847000	So that's why I think more people got hit
2847000	2849000	By Billy Mays than you would expect
2849000	2851000	I watch pitchmen and all he does is scream
2851000	2853000	On the show
2853000	2855000	No really he doesn't
2855000	2857000	It's weird
2857000	2859000	No offense to Beth or anything
2859000	2861000	But out of all the celebrity deaths
2861000	2863000	Actually the Billy Mays one was the most surprising
2863000	2865000	It's like holy crap
2865000	2867000	What the hell
2867000	2869000	There's somebody that's in perfectly good health
2869000	2871000	But apparently
2871000	2873000	The circumstances were all around
2873000	2875000	Apparently he was on a plane
2875000	2877000	That landed really
2877000	2879000	I don't know
2879000	2881000	Had a bad landing I guess
2881000	2883000	And it caused part of the ceiling or whatever
2883000	2885000	To hit him in the head and maybe
2885000	2887000	Did some brain damage that way and he died in his sleep
2887000	2889000	What
2889000	2891000	It was an American Airlines flight
2891000	2893000	So that's what's
2893000	2895000	Going on there
2895000	2897000	He died a few days later I guess
2897000	2899000	That so doesn't sound
2899000	2901000	Real
2901000	2903000	We would be hearing so much more about
2903000	2905000	This impending lawsuit and all this stuff
2905000	2907000	I think there will be an impending lawsuit
2907000	2909000	It sounds like it but
2909000	2911000	The pitchmen show is kind of fun
2911000	2913000	I like watching it
2913000	2915000	I don't mean any disrespect
2915000	2917000	It's just been such a weird week
2917000	2919000	We've been celebrating death
2919000	2921000	I shouldn't say celebrating
2921000	2923000	But you know what I mean memorializing
2923000	2925000	Trying to understand
2925000	2927000	Who will be tomorrow? Which celebrity is going to die tomorrow?
2927000	2929000	Life in the same week
2929000	2931000	My birthday was this week
2931000	2933000	I have because Beth only got 24
2933000	2935000	And you know
2935000	2937000	It just kind of goes to show
2937000	2939000	And I know this sounds like such a hokey
2939000	2941000	Dumb thing to say
2941000	2943000	But it really is so true
2943000	2945000	You've got to make the most out of the borrowed time you got
2945000	2947000	You do if there's something
2947000	2949000	That you've been wanting to do for a long time
2949000	2951000	That you haven't done yet
2951000	2953000	You need to just do it
2953000	2955000	Stop making excuses and do it
2955000	2957000	Because you may not be here tomorrow to do it then
2957000	2959000	So seriously
2959000	2961000	And I'm going to have to use instances like these
2961000	2963000	To remind me to get off my butt
2963000	2965000	And motivate myself
2965000	2967000	Because I should be thankful I'm here to do them
2967000	2969000	The other thing I want to say
2969000	2971000	Is that obviously swine flu ain't a joke
2971000	2973000	And I'm not saying you should run around
2973000	2975000	Be crazy scared of it
2975000	2977000	Wearing flu masks in public and all this stuff
2977000	2979000	But what I am saying
2979000	2981000	Boys, when you use the potty
2981000	2983000	Wash your hands after you go
2983000	2985000	Because I've watched people go in the men's room
2985000	2987000	And then just go right out
2987000	2989000	Perverts, I'm being serious for a minute here
2989000	2991000	You know you've seen this too
2991000	2993000	Maybe you've been a culprit
2993000	2995000	Walk in the men's room, use the restroom
2995000	2997000	Then walk right out without washing your hands
2997000	2999000	That shit needs to stop
2999000	3001000	We need to have a little more sanitary
3001000	3003000	We might not be able to stop disease
3003000	3005000	Completely
3005000	3007000	We can sure slow it down
3007000	3009000	And if anything this just goes to further
3009000	3011000	Emphasize the point that Vegas is dirty
3013000	3015000	Very dirty
3015000	3017000	Well, I don't know
3017000	3019000	We're not gonna know
3019000	3021000	But here's the thing
3021000	3023000	Wash your hands
3023000	3025000	After the bathroom, in general
3025000	3027000	After eating and all that stuff
3027000	3029000	Keep hand sanitizer with you
3029000	3031000	You don't have to be crazy germ obsessive
3031000	3033000	I don't think we need to start a frenzy
3033000	3035000	And I think that's sometimes what the media does
3035000	3037000	But just be careful
3037000	3039000	That's it
3039000	3041000	Be careful and don't be lazy
3041000	3043000	So there you go
3043000	3045000	Anyhow
3045000	3047000	That's, I guess, that for the deep topics
3047000	3049000	Let's get back into video games for a minute, can we?
3049000	3051000	I know, Loki, you've been awfully quiet
3051000	3053000	This whole time. Surely you've got some game stories
3053000	3055000	To take us away
3055000	3057000	I just want to say, though, again, we don't have a script tonight
3057000	3059000	So we're just gonna kind of wing it tonight with the game stories
3059000	3061000	We'll talk about things
3061000	3063000	We'll open up the Skype line a little bit if you guys want to call in as well
3063000	3065000	Also, housekeeping

3089000	3091000	Chat.All... Chat.
3091000	3093000	Oops, I almost gave the wrong chat room
3093000	3095000	Chat.OrangeLoungeRadio.com
3095000	3097000	There you go
3097000	3099000	Actually, I was reading an article on The Consumerists
3099000	3101000	By having an issue with his bacon of the month club
3101000	3103000	I was just surprised that there was a bacon of the month club
3103000	3105000	Of course it makes sense
3105000	3107000	Because bacon is awesome
3107000	3109000	And why not celebrate it once a month for 12 months
3109000	3111000	But uh
3111000	3113000	Yeah, it's interesting
3113000	3115000	Apparently not a very good program though
3115000	3117000	Better to buy your own bacon
3117000	3119000	But anyways
3119000	3121000	So yeah, stuff that's happened this week
3121000	3123000	A whole lot of interesting things
3123000	3125000	I guess I'll start things off with talking about
3125000	3127000	Best Buy
3127000	3131000	They're getting into the kiosk business I guess
3131000	3133000	And they're actually installing
3133000	3135000	They're testing it right now
3135000	3137000	They're installing some kiosks into a few of their stores
3137000	3139000	That are gonna do
3139000	3141000	Use game trade-ins
3141000	3143000	And also use movie trade-ins
3143000	3145000	So you can actually trade in your games
3145000	3147000	At these kiosks
3147000	3149000	And then
3149000	3151000	You basically get credit for whatever's in there
3151000	3153000	And they give you the credit
3153000	3155000	On a Best Buy card
3155000	3157000	And you get to go spend that credit in the store
3157000	3159000	Which I think is kind of a neat idea
3159000	3161000	And hey, you know, I'm all about
3161000	3163000	You know, getting
3163000	3165000	Um
3165000	3167000	You know, alternatives to like GameStop
3167000	3169000	And you know the thing that's kind of pissed me off about GameStop lately
3169000	3171000	Is when you do trades
3171000	3173000	Before they used to go, okay
3173000	3175000	You know, they scan a game, okay that was $18
3175000	3177000	Okay, here's, this is $24
3177000	3179000	And stuff like that
3179000	3181000	Now it's just like, they have all your trades
3181000	3183000	They've already put them behind the counter
3183000	3185000	And they give you pretty much store credit
3185000	3187000	It's like, well, you know, what if that was not satisfactory to me?
3187000	3189000	What if, you know, they don't say
3189000	3191000	Oh yeah, by the way, that one game was only worth 50 cents
3191000	3193000	You know, that
3193000	3195000	I don't like how they do that, it's kind of shady
3195000	3197000	You know, every place else tells you what you're getting for each game
3197000	3199000	That you trade in or movie or whatever
3199000	3201000	Is that just maybe the particular GameStop you're going to?
3201000	3203000	No, it's, they've all been doing it now
3203000	3205000	So, I don't know, maybe it's just
3205000	3207000	They don't care or whatever
3207000	3209000	But they used to do that, so
3209000	3211000	Now, what's kind of cool about this is
3211000	3213000	Basically, it works like this
3213000	3215000	You go to the kiosk
3215000	3217000	You scan the barcodes of the games that you have
3217000	3219000	On the machine
3219000	3221000	And it will tell you how much
3221000	3223000	It's going to give you for those games
3223000	3225000	And you say, okay
3225000	3227000	Whether to accept or deny that offer
3227000	3229000	So if you accept it
3229000	3231000	Then what you'll do is you'll pop the disc out
3231000	3233000	You'll drop the case into almost like a drop box
3233000	3235000	That they have there, like a mailbox
3235000	3237000	And then the discs themselves
3237000	3239000	Insert it into the machine
3239000	3241000	And it will scan them to make sure
3241000	3243000	That they're readable or don't have scratches on them
3243000	3245000	Or verify
3245000	3247000	I guess
3247000	3249000	If it's an authentic game or whatever
3249000	3251000	I don't know, the whole process
3251000	3253000	To me doesn't seem like it would work
3253000	3255000	Because
3255000	3257000	You know, the read
3257000	3259000	An Xbox 360 disc versus
3259000	3261000	Reading a Wii disc is completely different
3261000	3263000	And I mean, if you ever tried reading
3263000	3265000	A Wii disc on your PC
3265000	3267000	It doesn't work, it's because they read them differently
3267000	3269000	They have a different file format
3269000	3271000	So if it's actually physically scanning
3271000	3273000	The surface of the disc, make sure there's no
3273000	3275000	Scratches, I guess
3275000	3277000	Maybe that's how it's working
3277000	3279000	There's another one I think that they scanned
3279000	3281000	Like a little barcode that's in the middle of the disc
3281000	3283000	I'm not sure if that's how it's working
3283000	3285000	But either way, to kind of get around the whole
3285000	3287000	People just burning copies
3287000	3289000	Or whatever, just faking
3289000	3291000	Out the machine
3291000	3293000	You actually do have to scan a credit card in there as well
3293000	3295000	For verification purposes
3295000	3297000	At the same time, it makes me wonder
3297000	3299000	Huh, you know, I get these
3299000	3301000	Pre-paid cards or whatever from
3301000	3303000	My work every now and then for incentives
3303000	3305000	And spiffs, and you can basically put
3305000	3307000	Whatever information you want on those
3307000	3309000	Like you literally go onto a website
3309000	3311000	Log in, and you type in whatever
3311000	3313000	Billing information, if I wanted to make myself look like
3313000	3315000	Bob Barker or something like that, I could do that
3315000	3317000	And there's really no way
3317000	3319000	For the system to know, so
3319000	3321000	Here's what I don't understand
3321000	3323000	Why this whole elaborate
3323000	3325000	Kiosk thing
3325000	3327000	If this is the business Best Buy wants to get into
3327000	3329000	I mean, it's not like the stores are always
3329000	3331000	That freaking crowded and full of people
3331000	3333000	They're trying to- Why can't the service associates
3333000	3335000	Just scan the games and check them out
3335000	3337000	The old fashioned way? I don't know
3337000	3339000	Well, maybe it's because they're trying to get into more
3339000	3341000	Of like a GameStop
3341000	3343000	Type of business model
3343000	3345000	But at the same time, they don't want to really
3345000	3347000	I don't know
3347000	3349000	Train people to do it? Yes
3349000	3351000	Train people to do it, and also they're planning on
3351000	3353000	Doing this later on for- Don't they have to train people
3353000	3355000	To fix the machines? There's gonna have to be
3355000	3357000	Somebody in the store that knows how to operate
3357000	3359000	These machines all the time Not necessarily
3359000	3361000	Just like, you know, the red box machines
3361000	3363000	And stuff like that, they're in Walmarts and stuff
3363000	3365000	They have an independent company that comes out there
3365000	3367000	And services those machines
3367000	3369000	And the same thing for these
3369000	3371000	I have a feeling these are just branded
3371000	3373000	E-Play machines
3373000	3375000	Because E-Play is also
3375000	3377000	Working with, I want to say
3377000	3379000	Walmart as well
3379000	3381000	They're gonna be doing the same type of thing
3381000	3383000	Game trading it, and I bet you anything
3383000	3385000	They can brand their machines so it'll look like
3385000	3387000	Any sort of stuff
3387000	3389000	Walmart's machines are just gonna say Walmart
3389000	3391000	It's not gonna say E-Play
3391000	3393000	But I bet you these are the same machines
3393000	3395000	Because it sounds like the exact same thing that they're doing
3395000	3397000	With Walmart
3397000	3399000	I have so many games I should be trading back
3399000	3401000	I haven't even sold back a game in like years
3401000	3403000	No, probably been about a year
3403000	3405000	Probably about a year and a half
3405000	3407000	Was the last time I sold back a game
3407000	3409000	What was the last one on the GameCube?
3409000	3411000	I went and sold that one back finally
3411000	3413000	Seven was the GameCube one, right?
3413000	3415000	It was a couple Wii games
3415000	3417000	Oh no, Full Auto on the 360
3417000	3419000	I sold that back and the tennis game Top Spin I had
3419000	3421000	You know, games I just wasn't playing at all
3421000	3423000	But you know, you don't get that much for them
3423000	3425000	I think the game I got more for than any other
3425000	3427000	Was Mario Party
3427000	3429000	But that's because they'd stopped making it
3429000	3431000	And it was still in demand
3431000	3433000	There's a few games that'll be coming in high demand
3433000	3435000	And stuff like that
3435000	3437000	But for stuff that I don't plan on playing
3437000	3439000	Or I may have already picked up
3439000	3441000	Or whatnot
3441000	3443000	I try to trade it in as soon as I get it
3443000	3445000	Because that's usually what it's worth the most
3445000	3447000	And yeah, I know I can make a lot more money
3447000	3449000	Selling it on eBay
3449000	3451000	But to be honest, I just don't want to go through the hassle
3451000	3453000	And for me, it doesn't really make a difference
3453000	3455000	Because I'm not really losing out any money
3455000	3457000	When you think about it
3457000	3459000	Because I'm paying nothing to get the game
3459000	3461000	And any money I make from it
3461000	3463000	Is more money than I would have had anyways
3463000	3465000	So, I don't know
3465000	3467000	And a lot of times, you know, store credit and stuff
3467000	3469000	Sits on my card forever
3469000	3471000	You know, for a very long time before I actually use it for stuff
3471000	3473000	Because honestly
3473000	3475000	You know, with the situation that I have
3475000	3477000	My Wii is modded, my Xbox 360 is modded
3477000	3479000	The PS3 is the only thing that's not really modded
3479000	3481000	My PSP is modded, my DS is modded
3481000	3483000	I don't really have to buy games if I don't want to
3483000	3485000	I mean, that's the thing
3485000	3487000	I don't have to buy games
3487000	3489000	Because I can get them through other means
3489000	3491000	If I really want to play them
3491000	3493000	But honestly, I have less time to play games now
3493000	3497000	And, you know, I'm really not going to have time soon enough
3497000	3499000	Yes, exactly
3499000	3501000	So, you know, there's really
3501000	3503000	I don't, you know, maybe that's not
3503000	3505000	A great way to look at it
3505000	3507000	Because I'm sure a lot of developers and stuff work hard
3507000	3509000	And, you know, I'm putting out the games
3509000	3511000	But you know what, it's one game
3511000	3513000	And I mean, really
3513000	3515000	I don't know
3515000	3517000	I just don't care
3517000	3519000	And I know that's probably a bad, you know, stance on that
3519000	3521000	But I don't care
3521000	3523000	I do find it interesting
3523000	3525000	Everybody is trying to get into this business
3525000	3527000	It's going to be interesting to see if GameStop
3527000	3529000	Has to do something to
3529000	3531000	And other game stores, you know, have to do something
3531000	3533000	To kind of reinvigorate their business
3533000	3535000	With all this competition
3535000	3537000	Well, I could see them maybe putting an actual kiosk
3537000	3539000	Out in front of their store or something like that
3539000	3541000	You know, hey, look
3541000	3543000	Now you can trade games, you know
3543000	3545000	While we're closed
3545000	3547000	Or, you know, the other thing that these machines
3547000	3549000	Can do is allow you to rent
3549000	3551000	Games as well
3551000	3553000	Which, you know, they're testing that
3553000	3555000	And I think that's a great idea
3555000	3557000	You know, because, A, renting games
3557000	3559000	You know, especially when you can stick these kiosks
3559000	3561000	You know, like say in an apartment complex
3561000	3563000	Or something like that
3563000	3565000	That's kind of cool
3565000	3567000	And you can also trade movies into this
3567000	3569000	Which is also pretty cool because, you know what
3569000	3571000	GameStop doesn't take movies back anymore
3571000	3573000	They've stopped selling movies because it didn't work for them
3573000	3575000	So that's something else
3575000	3577000	So if you want to trade in
3577000	3579000	Now you don't have to necessarily buy a game with it
3579000	3581000	You can buy, you know, blank CD artists
3581000	3583000	Or, you know, an iPod
3583000	3585000	Or, you know, TV
3585000	3587000	That's one thing I do like about it
3587000	3589000	Is that, you know what, I could see myself using this money
3589000	3591000	More effectively at Best Buy
3591000	3593000	Just because there's more to pick from
3593000	3595000	Or, and the other thing too
3595000	3597000	You need a gift card for Best Buy
3597000	3599000	And then you go up front where they have their gift card kiosks
3599000	3601000	You know, with all these different gift cards
3601000	3603000	For like, say, you know, Red Lobster
3603000	3605000	Or something like that
3605000	3607000	You trade in some DVDs or whatever
3607000	3609000	And now you have dinner
3609000	3611000	So it, I don't know
3611000	3613000	There is benefits to it
3613000	3615000	And same thing with Walmart
3615000	3617000	Walmart's going to be doing the same type of thing
3617000	3619000	Where you get in-store credit
3619000	3621000	And hey, you know, some of these Super Walmarts
3621000	3623000	There's your groceries
3623000	3625000	So I don't see it as a bad thing
3625000	3627000	And, you know, if anything I do like the fact that
3627000	3629000	You know, you do have that choice
3629000	3631000	Where you can buy stuff other than games
3631000	3633000	Anyway, I want to just throw out there a special note
3633000	3635000	For the folks that are listening live
3635000	3637000	Apparently we've had a couple stream cut-outs tonight
3637000	3639000	While we're taping, I don't know what's going on with that
3639000	3641000	I just watched one happen
3641000	3643000	We did get booted on our end and we had to reconnect to the feed
3643000	3645000	I don't know if we're having
3645000	3647000	Bandwidth problems in studio
3647000	3649000	Or if that's something on the shoutcast end
3649000	3651000	I turned off my torrents
3651000	3653000	I don't know, it could just be a fluke
3653000	3655000	But there's nothing we can do here in studio
3655000	3657000	So we'll just keep doing our thing
3657000	3659000	Do the show best we can
3659000	3661000	But as far as we know, it is not on our end
3661000	3663000	Alright, so let's
3663000	3665000	I guess move on with some more news
3665000	3667000	If we can
3667000	3669000	Darcy, I know you had some things you wanted to talk about tonight
3669000	3671000	So let's make sure we get that taken care of
3671000	3673000	Well this is just a bit of interest
3673000	3675000	I know that there's people who are fans of the
3675000	3677000	Serious Sam series
3677000	3679000	So there's actually a PC version of
3679000	3681000	Serious Sam HD
3681000	3683000	That came out for Xbox Live Arcade
3683000	3685000	It will be released digitally
3685000	3687000	And also in shops
3687000	3689000	And the console version
3689000	3691000	However is not going to be out this summer
3691000	3693000	So it's going to be there
3693000	3695000	When it's there
3695000	3697000	So that's pretty good
3697000	3699000	Serious Sam is serious
3699000	3701000	I don't know, it looks kind of cool
3701000	3703000	Kind of like an old school
3703000	3705000	Duke Nukem type of game
3705000	3707000	That they're actually doing something to it
3707000	3709000	Other than just, let's put it back out
3709000	3711000	Or, hey, well Duke Nukem
3711000	3713000	I guess, Duke Nukem 3D did
3713000	3715000	Like that rewind thing
3715000	3717000	Which was neat
3717000	3719000	And then I stopped playing the game
3719000	3721000	That's the problem
3721000	3723000	They need a new Duke Nukem game
3723000	3725000	For like, Xbox Live
3725000	3727000	That'd be cool
3727000	3729000	Rumor is there might be another one in development
3729000	3731000	That was Duke Zero or something
3731000	3733000	Did you read that this week?
3733000	3735000	Yes I did
3735000	3737000	And my first thought was
3737000	3739000	Stop ripping off subtitles for Batman
3739000	3741000	Because seriously it was
3741000	3743000	Duke Nukem Forever
3743000	3745000	And then Duke begins
3745000	3747000	I'm like stop!
3747000	3749000	And then Duke and Robin, who knew
3749000	3751000	Exactly
3751000	3753000	Speaking of Xbox Live, can I say this real quick
3753000	3755000	I'm sorry DarkSakura, but you would appreciate this
3755000	3757000	Have you ever played Garou Mark of the Wolves
3757000	3759000	The game that came out on Xbox Live this week
3759000	3761000	I know you may not have played it on Xbox Live
3761000	3763000	Have you played it in the past?
3763000	3765000	Yeah I think I have the PS2 version
3765000	3767000	No I have the Dreamcast one
3767000	3769000	But you realize that some of the characters
3769000	3771000	In this game have some really funny names
3771000	3773000	Like who?
3773000	3775000	There are some characters
3775000	3777000	Like Kim Kap Wan apparently had kids
3777000	3779000	And one of them is named Dong
3779000	3781000	And that's one of the characters you can play
3781000	3783000	But then there's another character in the game
3783000	3785000	And the name of the character is
3785000	3787000	I'm looking for it here
3787000	3789000	Kushunud Butt
3789000	3791000	So you can literally play
3791000	3793000	In this game
3793000	3795000	Butt vs. Dong
3795000	3797000	Or Dong vs. Butt if you will
3797000	3799000	And I know this is so junior high
3799000	3801000	For me to say
3801000	3803000	But what kind of surprised me about this whole thing
3803000	3805000	The Butt vs. Dong
3805000	3807000	Is that we still have
3807000	3809000	This whole controversy going on about
3809000	3811000	What can and can't be in your profiles
3811000	3813000	I almost want to put
3813000	3815000	In my profile Butt vs. Dong
3815000	3817000	Just to see if I get
3817000	3819000	You know
3819000	3821000	A temp ban or something and say what
3821000	3823000	I was just referencing an epic
3823000	3825000	Mark of the Wolves fight I had online
3825000	3827000	Lord
3827000	3829000	Just saying
3829000	3831000	If you don't believe me
3831000	3833000	Go look
3833000	3835000	I am not making this
3835000	3837000	Crap
3837000	3839000	I know
3839000	3841000	I saw it in Rob D's Live Journal
3841000	3843000	He had a screenshot of it
3843000	3845000	I'll give credit where credit is due
3845000	3847000	And I just started laughing and I didn't believe it
3847000	3849000	I thought it was a photoshop thing
3849000	3851000	Like he was trying to make a joke I didn't get
3851000	3853000	So I looked it up on Wikipedia like the characters
3853000	3855000	As much as I love Fatal Fury
3855000	3857000	I went and looked it up on Wikipedia and sure enough
3857000	3859000	There's a character named Butt and a character named Dong
3859000	3861000	You need to come over
3861000	3863000	Well you know what after your dinner
3863000	3865000	Let's look up the Dreamcast
3865000	3867000	And get our Garou on
3867000	3869000	My boyfriend will be so bored
3869000	3871000	If he's here
3871000	3873000	He's not much of a gamer we'll see
3873000	3875000	Why don't we watch a movie
3875000	3877000	Movie he can do
3877000	3879000	We'll watch movies
3879000	3881000	On your sexy blu-ray
3881000	3883000	God my TV is sexy
3883000	3885000	Sorry more gaming news
3885000	3887000	Well I actually do have one other little thing
3887000	3889000	Sure
3889000	3891000	You know how we like to make fun of video game movies
3891000	3893000	You know I just was talking about Silent Hill
3893000	3895000	I love that movie
3895000	3897000	They're doing an Uncharted movie
3897000	3899000	It's actually being scripted
3899000	3901000	By Kyle Ward who already did
3901000	3903000	Kane and Lynch
3903000	3905000	Bruce Willis is starring in that
3905000	3907000	Pretty cool
3907000	3909000	I like Bruce Willis
3909000	3911000	Because he's aged better than Harrison Ford
3911000	3913000	Except for Hudson Hawk
3913000	3915000	No
3915000	3917000	Moving forward
3917000	3919000	But
3919000	3921000	It's also
3921000	3923000	Being produced by
3923000	3925000	Some former
3925000	3927000	Marvel people
3927000	3929000	Avi and Ari Arad
3929000	3931000	Who are also producing
3931000	3933000	The Lost Planet
3933000	3935000	They were actually
3935000	3937000	Going to adapt Lost Planet
3937000	3939000	To a film
3939000	3941000	So hey
3941000	3943000	That might be neat
3943000	3945000	If they do it right
3945000	3947000	The whole thing
3947000	3949000	With this video game to movie
3949000	3951000	Adaptation
3951000	3953000	It has to be done right
3953000	3955000	You know
3955000	3957000	We can't have
3957000	3959000	We can't have another
3959000	3961000	Repeat of
3961000	3963000	Super Mario Brothers
3963000	3965000	Oh lord
3965000	3967000	That's a movie I've never watched
3967000	3969000	I've seen a few minutes
3969000	3971000	I've seen like a few minutes
3971000	3973000	Of the end
3973000	3975000	I've heard it has funny scenes
3975000	3977000	I thought that movie was alright
3977000	3979000	I've never seen it in theaters
3979000	3981000	And you know what
3981000	3983000	So what if the Super Mario Brothers movie
3983000	3985000	Was crap
3985000	3987000	What the hell are you going to do
3987000	3989000	Plot wise with Super Mario Brothers
3989000	3991000	I mean seriously
3991000	3993000	There's nothing that they could have possibly done
3993000	3995000	That would have made any sense
3995000	3997000	At all
3997000	3999000	And you know
3999000	4001000	Props for them trying to come up with an original idea
4001000	4003000	To be honest
4003000	4005000	So it was kind of a rip off
4005000	4007000	Of Judge Dredd in a little bit
4007000	4009000	If you look at futuristic
4009000	4011000	City and stuff like that
4011000	4013000	But hey there's references to everything in there
4013000	4015000	And you know
4015000	4017000	At least they tried
4017000	4019000	What is up with your icons?
4019000	4021000	You know what the default
4021000	4023000	The default icons on our site come from
4023000	4025000	That's the default? Oh that's the WordPress one
4025000	4027000	It's a user generated
4027000	4029000	Site
4029000	4031000	I'm never getting rid of my Deadpool
4031000	4033000	Anyhow was that it for your stories today?
4033000	4035000	Well not for my stories
4035000	4037000	But that's all I'm going to talk about for now
4037000	4039000	Well then we'll come back to you later on in part B
4039000	4041000	Why don't we?
4041000	4043000	Alright cause we're going to take a break soon
4043000	4045000	But I want to get a few more stories out
4045000	4047000	I know Loki's got a bunch he wants to get through
4047000	4049000	I'll let him get one more
4049000	4051000	But let me just give you a couple quick ones here
4051000	4053000	Because some celebrity deaths
4053000	4055000	Are crazy around Hollywood
4055000	4057000	You know if I were in Hollywood right now and on prescription medications
4057000	4059000	I would be so worried
4059000	4061000	For what it's worth
4061000	4063000	But hey Michael Jackson if you want to
4063000	4065000	Have something to remember Michael Jackson
4065000	4067000	By of course we were talking about how art lives on forever
4067000	4069000	His Thriller video is actually free
4069000	4071000	Right now
4071000	4073000	Or did it just end?
4073000	4075000	I didn't get on and get the video
4075000	4077000	It is an epic music video
4077000	4079000	Like I wasn't sitting in my living room
4079000	4081000	I was in second grade watching it when it aired
4081000	4083000	When did it end? Wasn't it just today?
4083000	4085000	It was today I guess
4085000	4087000	Today's not over?
4087000	4089000	Well it's 200 Microsoft points now so
4089000	4091000	Well it was free
4091000	4093000	Sorry if you didn't get your hands on it
4093000	4095000	You know I actually do remember when that aired
4095000	4097000	I do too MTV used to air the whole darn thing
4097000	4099000	Well there was a special thing they were doing
4099000	4101000	It was supposed to air at midnight
4101000	4103000	And my mom
4103000	4105000	I was in second grade
4105000	4107000	And my mom let me stay up to watch it
4107000	4109000	When it aired at midnight
4109000	4111000	I kind of agree with
4111000	4113000	Frisbee and chat, chat.artisanshredder.com
4113000	4115000	Just go to YouTube and watch it
4115000	4117000	If you need to see the Thriller video
4117000	4119000	Fire up your Playstation 3
4119000	4121000	And go to the web browser and pull up Thriller on YouTube
4121000	4123000	There you go, free
4123000	4125000	In fact lots of Michael Jackson videos
4125000	4127000	Available for free
4127000	4129000	Thanks to the wonders of YouTube
4129000	4131000	Thank you Frisbee
4131000	4133000	Appreciate it
4133000	4135000	Hey some other stories going on out there right now
4135000	4137000	Apparently there is some new developments
4137000	4139000	On games coming to Playstation Network
4139000	4141000	At least in Japan
4141000	4143000	Final Fantasy and Mega Man
4143000	4145000	And I am talking the old school Final Fantasy game
4145000	4147000	That's right Final Fantasy 1
4147000	4149000	So I know this is weird because
4149000	4151000	Final Fantasy 1 was on the NES
4151000	4153000	But here's the thing, this is apparently
4153000	4155000	The Playstation re-release
4155000	4157000	Or whatever
4157000	4159000	Which was the original but with some minor tweaks
4159000	4161000	It was the one that, it's sort of like what they put out on the PSP
4161000	4163000	But not what they put out on the PSP
4163000	4165000	I want to clarify that
4165000	4167000	Because the one they put out on the PSP was like really
4167000	4169000	It was almost high def and stuff
4169000	4171000	It was really fancy
4171000	4173000	They added some dungeons and stuff like that
4173000	4175000	In the PS1 version or whatever
4175000	4177000	But I don't know
4177000	4179000	Well now here's the thing
4179000	4181000	Mega Man 9 actually
4181000	4183000	Came out in Japan way later than we got it
4183000	4185000	I don't know how that happened but they did
4185000	4187000	They got the game a lot later than we did
4187000	4189000	They just got it and apparently
4189000	4191000	There is some type of competition going on
4191000	4193000	In Japan right now
4193000	4195000	If you enter this competition you get
4195000	4197000	Rockman because that's what they call Mega Man over there
4197000	4199000	Rockman Complete Works
4199000	4201000	It's Mega Man 1 through 6 which I think was some type of
4201000	4203000	Playstation compilation they had
4203000	4205000	Before the one they had here on
4205000	4207000	Playstation 2 and GameCube
4207000	4209000	Because that's when they added in 7 and 8
4209000	4211000	So yeah they have 1 through 6
4211000	4213000	Available on a Playstation 1 disc
4213000	4215000	But it's now on Playstation Network over in Japan
4215000	4217000	So hopefully keep your fingers and toes crossed
4217000	4219000	Maybe these games will come out over here
4219000	4221000	At least that's what people are hoping
4221000	4223000	My thought? Don't bet on it
4223000	4225000	I don't think either of these games are going to come out in the west
4225000	4227000	You want to know why? I don't think they're going to go back and bother
4227000	4229000	To re-translate them. Why would they? They didn't before
4229000	4231000	Do you think somebody is really going to go in
4231000	4233000	And translate Final Fantasy 1
4233000	4235000	Just to release on Playstation Network?
4235000	4237000	Fat chance
4237000	4239000	Didn't they have that over here?
4239000	4241000	There was something that was a Final Fantasy collection
4241000	4243000	It was a few games
4243000	4245000	On the PSP they have Final Fantasy 1 and 2
4245000	4247000	No they actually had one on the Playstation
4247000	4249000	They had the one that was 5 and 6
4249000	4251000	And then they had the 4 and Chrono Trigger
4251000	4253000	So maybe those will show up
4253000	4255000	On Playstation Network
4255000	4257000	That's certainly a possibility
4257000	4259000	I think it would be actually kind of rad to see
4259000	4261000	The 5 and 6 compilation show up
4261000	4263000	Final Fantasy 6
4263000	4265000	Not a Final Fantasy game that's been visited in a little while
4265000	4267000	And it's one of the greatest if not the greatest Final Fantasy game
4267000	4269000	Period
4269000	4271000	So 4 is getting a lot of attention again thanks to the after years
4271000	4273000	But 6
4273000	4275000	Oh my god if they didn't after years for 6
4275000	4277000	I'd be all over that
4277000	4279000	Don't even tell me
4279000	4281000	I'm still all over 5 by the way
4281000	4283000	I still think 5 is the best of them
4285000	4287000	Let's see
4287000	4289000	GameGuru says Mega Man Anniversary Edition actually used
4289000	4291000	The Rockman Complete Works versions
4291000	4293000	Of the NES games so they've been translated
4293000	4295000	Interesting
4295000	4297000	They still won't go back yet
4297000	4299000	You know what if they did
4299000	4301000	It would be a pleasant surprise
4301000	4303000	But at the same time I do own the compilation
4303000	4305000	On GameCube already
4305000	4307000	I don't really need it
4307000	4309000	Well hey you know what maybe they'll move to
4309000	4311000	Since they're going to be doing the digital download
4311000	4313000	Stuff now
4313000	4315000	Maybe they're going to try to move more towards
4315000	4317000	If they do a Playstation 2 emulation
4317000	4319000	Or something like that
4319000	4321000	The full Playstation 2 game downloads
4321000	4323000	Just like they have with the PS3
4323000	4325000	At least with Burnout
4325000	4327000	Maybe we'll see that when that happens
4327000	4329000	I know there's a lot of Mega Man and Final Fantasy
4329000	4331000	Fans that would love to see these come out
4331000	4333000	On Playstation Network
4333000	4335000	I would say maybe Final Fantasy 1
4335000	4337000	For PSP will be on the
4337000	4339000	Download because all the PSP games are shifting
4339000	4341000	To download only I think that's inevitable
4341000	4343000	At some point
4343000	4345000	I don't know about these exact games
4345000	4347000	By the way though I will say this though
4347000	4349000	Final Fantasy 1 that Playstation remake is only $6
4349000	4351000	That's not bad at all
4351000	4353000	But I'm telling you I don't know how this one was
4353000	4355000	On the Playstation but if they didn't update
4355000	4357000	The battle system to the more active
4357000	4359000	Time battle that they featured in the PSP
4359000	4361000	Remake the more Final Fantasy 4 style battle
4361000	4363000	I can't like it's so
4363000	4365000	Hard to go from what you're used
4365000	4367000	To back to old
4367000	4369000	School Final Fantasy battle which was
4369000	4371000	Like if you attack the monster and the
4371000	4373000	Monster dies mid round then
4373000	4375000	You lose your attack gets mixing a lot
4375000	4377000	Harder back there and
4377000	4379000	The whole thing and the magic not being based
4379000	4381000	Off of MP but a whole different system
4381000	4383000	So what if they
4383000	4385000	When I have to tell you what popped into my
4385000	4387000	Head though when you mentioned Final Fantasy
4387000	4389000	And Mega Man it's like
4389000	4391000	Mega Man in Final Fantasy
4391000	4393000	Hey that'd be kind of cool
4393000	4395000	So
4395000	4397000	Game grew also
4397000	4399000	As for Final Fantasy is it the Playstation 1
4399000	4401000	Version because Final Fantasy Origins came
4401000	4403000	Over here no I know that but I'm talking Final Fantasy
4403000	4405000	1 not the
4405000	4407000	It wasn't Origins the 5-6 combo
4407000	4409000	4-5
4409000	4411000	No 4 and Trigger was another
4411000	4413000	thing they called like Final Fantasy
4413000	4415000	Chronicles I want to say
4415000	4417000	Forgive me if my memory
4417000	4419000	Is fading it's been many years since that came out
4419000	4421000	But there was yeah
4421000	4423000	Well there was a time though that I would have hopped all
4423000	4425000	Over this but I had
4425000	4427000	The
4427000	4429000	I actually bought a wonder swan color
4429000	4431000	So I could play Final Fantasy
4431000	4433000	Still no word on Mystic Quest
4433000	4435000	Who cares
4435000	4437000	Loki
4437000	4439000	You got anything else for us maybe one more story
4439000	4441000	Before we go to a break tonight? Yeah sure why not
4441000	4443000	Well apparently
4443000	4445000	There's some more details coming out
4445000	4447000	About No More Heroes 2 and this is
4447000	4449000	Coming from Nintendo Power
4449000	4451000	And there's
4451000	4453000	I guess 3 different plot details
4453000	4455000	That I guess can be considered spoilers
4455000	4457000	But apparently
4457000	4459000	Shinobu the teen
4459000	4461000	Assassin from the original game will be returning
4461000	4463000	In this sequel
4463000	4465000	As a playable character her
4465000	4467000	Fighting style I guess will be different
4467000	4469000	Than Travis' and
4469000	4471000	She'll move faster it can even jump
4471000	4473000	And I guess you can play her whenever you want
4473000	4475000	They're expecting
4475000	4477000	That there's going to be 50 boss battles
4477000	4479000	And you'll also be able to play the bosses
4479000	4481000	With either character
4481000	4483000	And just to mix things up
4483000	4485000	And there'll be different cutscenes
4485000	4487000	And stuff like that for that
4487000	4489000	And then finally it says the primary reason that
4489000	4491000	Travis is taking on the United
4491000	4493000	Assassins Association again is to
4493000	4495000	Avenge the death of his best friend from the first game
4495000	4497000	Bishop
4497000	4499000	And unfortunately I didn't play through the first game enough
4499000	4501000	To probably get to any of those
4501000	4503000	Plot points but
4503000	4505000	I am kind of
4505000	4507000	I want to check out the sequel though
4507000	4509000	And probably go back to the first one at some point
4509000	4511000	Once again you know that would
4511000	4513000	Probably require me to
4513000	4515000	Somehow slow down time
4515000	4517000	Which I don't think I can
4517000	4519000	Need more hours in the day
4521000	4523000	Let's go ahead and do one more
4523000	4525000	I see you have a whole lot of stories there
4525000	4527000	We're going to have so much stuff for Part B
4527000	4529000	Let's do one more
4529000	4531000	Australia has decided to
4531000	4533000	Block online access to games
4533000	4535000	With content beyond the rating
4535000	4537000	MA-15
4537000	4539000	Apparently this will
4539000	4541000	Apply to
4541000	4543000	I guess
4543000	4545000	Console games
4545000	4547000	Also famous MMORPGs
4547000	4549000	Such as Second Life and World of Warcraft
4549000	4551000	Very well may be affected by
4551000	4553000	This new censorship policy
4553000	4555000	Wait a minute I thought I heard something about this a while ago
4555000	4557000	They were talking about that World of Warcraft would not be playable
4557000	4559000	In Australia or something
4559000	4561000	Is this like a further development or something?
4561000	4563000	Maybe I'm crazy
4563000	4565000	I thought I heard something like this before
4565000	4567000	Sorry man I don't mean to like
4567000	4569000	Move in on the story
4569000	4571000	This sounds like we've heard something like this before
4571000	4573000	I remember
4573000	4575000	They will be
4575000	4577000	Very well may be affected
4577000	4579000	By this new censorship policy
4579000	4581000	If it pushes through
4581000	4583000	That online games exemption on
4583000	4585000	Content ratings is the only reason
4585000	4587000	Why multiplayer games with
4587000	4589000	User generated environments are possibly in
4589000	4591000	This country
4591000	4593000	Without it it would take
4593000	4595000	One game user anywhere in the world to
4595000	4597000	Produce objectionable content
4597000	4599000	And the game environment to make
4599000	4601000	The Australian government ban the game for everyone
4601000	4603000	They're just saying
4603000	4605000	Someone's going to ruin it
4605000	4607000	But yeah
4607000	4609000	Apparently I guess
4609000	4611000	Second Life will probably be
4611000	4613000	Part of that since
4613000	4615000	Second Life is pretty objectionable as it is
4617000	4619000	Interesting
4619000	4621000	Why did they want to ban it? Just because they can't control it?
4621000	4623000	They can't release it?
4623000	4625000	Second Life is about to be locked
4625000	4627000	It says
4627000	4629000	It will be barred under
4629000	4631000	The mystery sinister filtering plan
4631000	4633000	This is going back to
4633000	4635000	The whole MA-15 thing
4635000	4637000	Because there is adult content
4637000	4639000	In Second Life
4639000	4641000	There's two sexy things
4641000	4643000	As Destructoid puts it
4643000	4645000	There's adult things everywhere
4645000	4647000	That looks pretty adult to me
4647000	4649000	I don't know
4649000	4651000	Well hey before we go to break tonight
4651000	4653000	We have a couple things we want to get through
4653000	4655000	We got to get to the classic game of the week
4655000	4657000	But I also want to get some voicemails out of the way
4657000	4659000	Because it's been forever since we played some voicemails
4659000	4661000	Here on the show
4661000	4663000	And I know we had a few on the line tonight
4663000	4665000	That we wanted to play
4665000	4667000	And I got to bring up the voicemails here
4667000	4669000	First off

4887000	4889000	Anyway
4889000	4891000	Let's get to the classic game of the week shall we
4891000	4893000	Dark Sakura always likes to take a trip through the archives
4893000	4895000	And pick a game that you kids
4895000	4897000	Should be checking out and playing every week
4897000	4899000	Well you can
4899000	4901000	Play the game every week if you want
4901000	4903000	But she also gives you a new game each week that you can play
4903000	4905000	So here it is
4905000	4907000	Dark Sakura's classic game of the week
4911000	4913000	So Dark Sakura
4913000	4915000	What game should the kids be playing
4915000	4917000	This week?
4917000	4919000	They should be playing Dragon Force on the Sega Saturn
4919000	4921000	Wait like Dragon Force from Guitar Hero?
4921000	4923000	No
4923000	4925000	Boo
4925000	4927000	Let me pull up the audio here real quick
4927000	4929000	In the studio
4929000	4931000	Tell us a little bit about Dragon Force
4931000	4933000	What this game is all about
4933000	4935000	Dragon Force is a
4935000	4937000	Combination real time and turn based strategy
4937000	4939000	Game
4939000	4941000	It was actually released in America
4941000	4943000	As a working design
4943000	4945000	Translation
4945000	4947000	We never did get the sequel over here however
4947000	4949000	The sequel was pretty freaking good
4949000	4951000	But basically
4951000	4953000	You play as
4953000	4955000	One of this continents eight rulers
4955000	4957000	And
4957000	4959000	Each ruler of course has a different goal
4959000	4961000	One wants to rule the whole thing
4961000	4963000	Someone wants to unite everyone
4963000	4965000	People want to destroy it
4965000	4967000	And so you move along these paths
4967000	4969000	From towns to castles
4969000	4971000	And you want to capture the castles
4971000	4973000	And then you face off in battle
4973000	4975000	So you have your
4975000	4977000	Strategy tactics
4977000	4979000	Where you're moving around
4979000	4981000	From
4981000	4983000	Town to town across your map
4983000	4985000	But then when you
4985000	4987000	Get to towns and castles you have your
4987000	4989000	Battle and you play as the general
4989000	4991000	Commanding their troops
4991000	4993000	And so once you
4993000	4995000	Get to that part you're
4995000	4997000	Commanding these epic battles
4997000	4999000	And it's you know you have a
4999000	5001000	Also an
5001000	5003000	End game week where you do
5003000	5005000	Administrative stuff where you tend to your troops
5005000	5007000	You know you can increase the number of your troops
5007000	5009000	You can pay them more
5009000	5011000	You can capture
5011000	5013000	Enemy generals
5013000	5015000	Join your army, fortify castles that type of stuff
5015000	5017000	But the big thing
5017000	5019000	Is really the epic battles
5019000	5021000	And
5021000	5023000	This is probably
5023000	5025000	One of the greatest video games
5025000	5027000	Of all time in fact
5027000	5029000	It won EGM's game of the month award
5029000	5031000	In 1986
5031000	5033000	If you skip
5033000	5035000	Just a little bit
5035000	5037000	On that video you can get to the battle
5037000	5039000	There you go
5039000	5041000	You get to see
5041000	5043000	Your big armies and I've actually
5043000	5045000	There's battles of larger armies than that
5049000	5051000	This game looks different
5051000	5053000	It actually is really a lot of fun
5053000	5055000	In fact
5055000	5057000	It's like you really
5057000	5059000	To make this work for radio
5059000	5061000	That you kind of watch them like
5061000	5063000	There's these big armies
5063000	5065000	And they're kind of throwing fireballs
5065000	5067000	And things like across this field
5067000	5069000	And you watch the TV kind of scroll through this field
5069000	5071000	Until it gets to the other army
5071000	5073000	It's kind of interesting
5073000	5075000	It's like a side scrolling RTS game
5075000	5077000	The battles are
5077000	5079000	Term based like that
5079000	5081000	So you basically
5081000	5083000	As you can see in that part now they're actually doing melee
5083000	5085000	You know your goal is to
5085000	5087000	Capture or kill the other general
5087000	5089000	And so
5089000	5091000	Each general can attack each other
5091000	5093000	They've got their special abilities
5093000	5095000	But you can also send your troops to
5095000	5097000	Overrun the other too
5097000	5099000	You know so whether or not you want to leave yourself
5099000	5101000	Defended or whether or not you want to take over
5101000	5103000	The other general
5103000	5105000	It's pretty neat
5105000	5107000	It's like you're commanding your own army
5107000	5109000	Actually I think they based
5109000	5111000	Did they base Advance Wars sort of off this?
5111000	5113000	I think a little bit
5113000	5115000	But this definitely
5115000	5117000	Kind of thing
5117000	5119000	It's epic
5119000	5121000	This game is an epic game
5121000	5123000	Just like Dragon Force the band
5123000	5125000	Which who knows maybe that's where they got their name
5125000	5127000	You never know
5127000	5129000	Could be but um
5129000	5131000	Actually go ahead and link that in the chat room
5131000	5133000	Let people take a look at it
5133000	5135000	Because really it's something you have to see before you play
5135000	5137000	For those of you listening on the podcast
5137000	5139000	You can always search for this on YouTube
5139000	5141000	Dragon Force is two words
5141000	5143000	Just look for Dragon Force Sega Saturn
5143000	5145000	Version is very
5145000	5147000	Very hard to find
5147000	5149000	Very hard to get
5149000	5151000	It's a working designs title
5151000	5153000	Good luck
5153000	5155000	They did do a release for it
5155000	5157000	As part of the Sega Ages
5157000	5159000	PS2 collection
5159000	5161000	But that version isn't Japanese
5161000	5163000	I like that the
5163000	5165000	Troops rally
5165000	5167000	They yell and run into battle
5167000	5169000	That's pretty hardcore
5169000	5171000	You got your troops falling in battle
5171000	5173000	Doing their best to defend their generals
5173000	5175000	So it's pretty
5175000	5177000	Pretty cool
5177000	5179000	So a RTS RPG
5179000	5181000	Action-y kind of game
5181000	5183000	It's so hard to describe otherwise
5183000	5185000	It's very hard to find here in America
5185000	5187000	But good luck
5187000	5189000	Maybe you'll find something
5189000	5191000	Out there that's playable
5191000	5193000	Well in Japan it was published by Sega
5193000	5195000	But it's a working designs
5195000	5197000	Release over here
5197000	5199000	Dragon Force is the classic game of the week
5199000	5201000	Yes
5201000	5203000	And I believe that's all there is to say on that
5203000	5205000	So
5205000	5207000	That's going to do it for part A tonight of Orange Lounge Radio
5207000	5209000	But fear not we have plenty more to get to tonight
5209000	5211000	Including the mailbag, the FUs of the week
5211000	5213000	Your calls and more gaming news
5213000	5215000	And we're going to get to that all
5215000	5217000	After a quick break here in studio
5217000	5219000	At Orange Lounge Radio
5219000	5221000	So stay tuned guys, we'll be right back with more
5221000	5227000	Orange Lounge Radio
5227000	5229000	Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio
5229000	5231000	On this June the 28th of 2009
5231000	5233000	Where we're celebrating our 7th anniversary
5233000	5235000	Of Orange Lounge Radio
5235000	5237000	With nothing of particular or special
5237000	5239000	Notice we're just doing the same old crap we always do
5239000	5241000	Although we got really in depth tonight
5241000	5243000	In part A, kind of having a long side discussion
5243000	5245000	But you know we're just kind of
5245000	5247000	Just having a really chill night
5247000	5249000	No pre-planned list of
5249000	5251000	Topics to cover tonight
5251000	5253000	We're just doing whatever we want to talk about tonight
5253000	5255000	And the latest and greatest in gaming news
5255000	5257000	We'll get back into some more news
5257000	5259000	I'm hoping Loki has a few more stories for us
5259000	5261000	Maybe one more story then I'm sure Jamie's got a couple too
5261000	5263000	Sorry I'm reminiscing about
5263000	5265000	The steak I had at Daily Grill
5265000	5267000	Back during E3 because that was the best
5267000	5269000	Steak ever. Where's Daily Grill? I've not heard of that
5269000	5271000	Well this was in LA
5271000	5273000	But they actually have one in San Francisco and one in Brentwood
5273000	5275000	Have you ever been to Ruth Chris?
5275000	5277000	Uh
5277000	5279000	No. I'm telling you that is an incredible steak
5279000	5281000	It's expensive
5281000	5283000	If you and the wife go there you're gonna spend 80 bucks
5283000	5285000	But it is
5285000	5287000	Good steak
5287000	5289000	That's my favorite steak right there
5289000	5291000	The best steak though, seriously
5291000	5293000	Daily Grill, the New York Pepper Steak
5293000	5295000	As cracked pepper
5295000	5297000	Bacon and onions on top of it
5297000	5299000	Oh my god is it
5299000	5301000	The best steak ever, I'm serious
5301000	5303000	I'm gonna have to check that out at some point
5303000	5305000	It is awesome. Wait did you go there this year during E3?
5305000	5307000	I went this year during E3
5307000	5309000	It was right next to our hotel
5309000	5311000	Nice
5311000	5313000	Anywho
5313000	5315000	We've got some news
5315000	5317000	Let's see which we'll pick here
5317000	5319000	Um
5319000	5321000	How about
5321000	5323000	Let's talk about how crappy home is
5323000	5325000	Fewer than one in three
5325000	5327000	PS3 systems are connected to
5327000	5329000	PlayStation Home
5329000	5331000	According to Peter Edward
5331000	5333000	The director of PlayStation Home
5333000	5335000	Europe, PlayStation Home has gained
5335000	5337000	7 million users
5337000	5339000	worldwide with 3 million in Europe alone
5339000	5341000	And
5341000	5343000	But you know of course with
5343000	5345000	21 million PS3 sold worldwide
5345000	5347000	That's you know
5347000	5349000	Less than one third so
5349000	5351000	He considers it
5351000	5353000	You know
5353000	5355000	Well he considers home of course
5355000	5357000	The starting point for PlayStation 3 online
5357000	5359000	Of course I would say he's a little bit
5359000	5361000	Biased since you know he is the director of
5361000	5363000	PlayStation Home he kind of has to say that
5363000	5365000	But um
5365000	5367000	I don't know it's just
5367000	5369000	If a lot of people are like
5369000	5371000	Me they just
5371000	5373000	It's neat it's a neat idea
5373000	5375000	But
5375000	5377000	I don't know I just don't want to go
5377000	5379000	To PlayStation Home
5379000	5381000	Okay but here's my thing
5381000	5383000	Like I realize that's how the blogs are kind of skewing this
5383000	5385000	Is that oh nobody's on PlayStation Home
5385000	5387000	But since when was 7 million
5387000	5389000	A bad number of people to have using your thing
5389000	5391000	I mean isn't that actually kind of good
5391000	5393000	I mean at risk of sounding like a Sony fanboy
5393000	5395000	Is one in three in this case really
5395000	5397000	That bad because
5397000	5399000	Yes I understand Home is free
5399000	5401000	I guess but think about how many people are buying their
5401000	5403000	PlayStation 3's let's be honest and here's
5403000	5405000	Here's my little you know let's look at both sides
5405000	5407000	Of the coin is that I actually think these numbers are
5407000	5409000	Pretty good for Home but the bad side is
5409000	5411000	I think there's a lot of people that are buying their PlayStation 3's
5411000	5413000	Just for Blu-ray players I think their expectations
5413000	5415000	Were though that 100% of the people
5415000	5417000	Would be well dream the F on
5417000	5419000	There are 100 people on Xbox Live
5419000	5421000	Well okay granted you have to pay for Xbox Live
5421000	5423000	But I would bet there's
5423000	5425000	Not even 100% of people
5425000	5427000	That have an Xbox profile
5427000	5429000	I bet there's a lot of people
5429000	5431000	That buy their Xbox 360
5431000	5433000	And just put the game in and play
5433000	5435000	Because you don't always have to sign into profiles
5435000	5437000	And stuff to play games you know what I mean
5437000	5439000	Like I bet you there's a lot of folks
5439000	5441000	That don't bother with all this other stuff
5441000	5443000	That just use their console to play games
5443000	5445000	And that's it
5445000	5447000	But you know
5447000	5449000	It's not the splash they were hoping
5449000	5451000	To make
5451000	5453000	I just don't think 7 million is that bad of a number
5453000	5455000	I got to say
5455000	5457000	I'm surprised yeah sj100mat in our chat room
5457000	5459000	Chat.orangelandtrader.com says
5459000	5461000	There are 7 million PS3 owners
5461000	5463000	Actually there's 21 million PS3 owners
5463000	5465000	I'm one of them I think we all are
5465000	5467000	That's what I actually just said
5467000	5469000	All three of us own one
5469000	5471000	So it took me a little while
5471000	5473000	To get on board
5473000	5475000	My question though is this accounts
5475000	5477000	Or is this actually users
5477000	5479000	You know individual consoles because
5479000	5481000	I don't know about you but I have four accounts on my
5481000	5483000	You know
5483000	5485000	PlayStation 3
5485000	5487000	One for each region so I can download you know
5487000	5489000	Games in different regions and then one for Nelly
5489000	5491000	Yeah but you're an anomaly
5491000	5493000	You're not the normal type of player
5493000	5495000	You know even if they were counting accounts
5495000	5497000	I don't think it would make that big of a difference at the end of the day
5497000	5499000	So
5499000	5501000	Let's see
5501000	5503000	Corypheus in chat says
5503000	5505000	And you many of those owners now
5505000	5507000	PS3 Paperweight owners
5507000	5509000	Were owners of an expensive Blu-ray
5509000	5511000	I don't know
5511000	5513000	There's still games I've played on PlayStation 3
5513000	5515000	When I got mine it was a cheap Blu-ray player
5515000	5517000	Yeah I know it was a cheap Blu-ray player at the time
5517000	5519000	I didn't pay for mine so
5519000	5521000	Can't get much cheaper than that
5521000	5523000	Dark Soccer
5523000	5525000	Do you have anything you want to cover?
5525000	5527000	Actually I do
5527000	5529000	My feet with socks no I'm kidding
5529000	5531000	They want to expand
5531000	5533000	The cameras
5533000	5535000	Through a broader online service
5535000	5537000	So they want to use
5537000	5539000	TV, the cameras, your phones
5539000	5541000	And they're thinking of launching that
5541000	5543000	Around Spring 2010
5543000	5545000	Or at least that's their general idea
5545000	5547000	There was an article
5547000	5549000	In Fortune about
5549000	5551000	What they want to do
5551000	5553000	And it's basically saying
5553000	5555000	That they want it to be the ultimate multimedia
5555000	5557000	Experience
5557000	5559000	That, you know, if you have
5559000	5561000	The multiple Sony products
5561000	5563000	They're all linked together
5563000	5565000	Kaz Hirai
5565000	5567000	Was actually quoted saying
5567000	5569000	That the service will overlay the backbone of the PlayStation
5569000	5571000	Network but be broader and more open
5571000	5573000	So you'd be able to
5573000	5575000	Download movies to TV
5575000	5577000	Share photos between devices, friends
5577000	5579000	So basically they want to make
5579000	5581000	Xbox Live
5583000	5585000	But I don't understand
5585000	5587000	What's this whole camera supposed to be?
5587000	5589000	I don't get it
5589000	5591000	They're saying that it's just part of the whole thing
5591000	5593000	They want to
5593000	5595000	Incorporate all of their electronic
5595000	5597000	Products into this big network
5597000	5599000	I see, okay
5599000	5601000	It's spreading around
5601000	5603000	The company brand, why not?
5603000	5605000	Where do you think most of those movies come from?
5605000	5607000	Sony Pictures, right?
5607000	5609000	They're saying that basically they're going to start small
5609000	5611000	And work from there
5611000	5613000	To just basically
5613000	5615000	Get all the different services that function with each device
5615000	5617000	And then roll out their plan
5617000	5619000	I don't think I would ever
5619000	5621000	Buy a camera
5621000	5623000	On PlayStation Network
5623000	5625000	But, you know, if
5625000	5627000	Even only a small handful of people do
5627000	5629000	It's not that much resources to probably put this up for sale
5629000	5631000	On there, so why not?
5631000	5633000	You know what I'd actually like to see do
5633000	5635000	If they're really working on networking people
5635000	5637000	Is actually have a true
5637000	5639000	Teleconference
5639000	5641000	Video conference ability
5641000	5643000	Kind of do that with Xbox 360
5643000	5645000	But that's just one to one, right?
5645000	5647000	You can't really do more than one camera chat
5647000	5649000	Yeah, it'd be neat though if you could do like
5649000	5651000	Your multiple chat room
5651000	5653000	Interesting
5653000	5655000	Anyway, that's just my idea
5655000	5657000	Don't steal my idea, Sony, or I'll stab you in the face
5657000	5659000	Shove crayons down your throat
5659000	5661000	Well, wait a minute
5661000	5663000	Didn't they have the old
5663000	5665000	PlayStation 2, wasn't there itoy chat?
5665000	5667000	That came out?
5667000	5669000	There was
5669000	5671000	A late that everyone had moved on
5671000	5673000	I think to the next generation of gaming
5673000	5675000	And people weren't really talking about itoy chat anymore
5675000	5677000	Like I remember
5677000	5679000	This was a subject of a lot of mocking early on
5679000	5681000	Because it was just, you know, like
5681000	5683000	Just we could see
5683000	5685000	The potential for abuse in this thing
5685000	5687000	And, you know, they had talked about moderation and all that
5687000	5689000	I'm wondering, whatever happened
5689000	5691000	Did this game actually come out?
5691000	5693000	I'm wondering if it didn't just
5693000	5695000	Get pulled before it ever came out
5695000	5697000	Now I gotta check it out
5697000	5699000	I totally gotta check it out now
5699000	5701000	I'll research that, you talk about something else, Logie
5701000	5703000	Okay
5703000	5705000	Let's see
5705000	5707000	Apparently there's another rumor
5707000	5709000	From the Ars Technica mole
5709000	5711000	Saying that there's gonna be some
5711000	5713000	Console drops
5713000	5715000	Or price drops, at least
5715000	5717000	Coming, well, this fall
5717000	5719000	For both the PlayStation 3
5719000	5721000	And Xbox 360
5721000	5723000	Of course
5723000	5725000	In the past, the Ars Technica mole
5725000	5727000	Has been correct about a few other things
5727000	5729000	Including, you know, the
5729000	5731000	Capabilities of the PSP Go
5731000	5733000	Or the release of the
5733000	5735000	Resident Evil 5, Xbox 360 bundle
5735000	5737000	And
5737000	5739000	I guess the
5739000	5741000	360 price drop last fall
5741000	5743000	Apparently it says on the Sony's front
5743000	5745000	They're claiming that the 80GB
5745000	5747000	PS3 will become scarce
5747000	5749000	Over the next two months
5749000	5751000	And will be mostly replaced by the 160GB model
5751000	5753000	And the
5753000	5755000	I guess
5755000	5757000	Larger model continues to sell into the fall
5757000	5759000	And apparently they will simultaneously
5759000	5761000	Announce that the
5761000	5763000	PS3 Slim
5763000	5765000	And
5765000	5767000	The even more, I guess
5767000	5769000	Rumored price cuts
5769000	5771000	Will be announced around the same time
5771000	5773000	And
5773000	5775000	They don't know how much it's gonna be
5775000	5777000	Dropped in price, but they know
5777000	5779000	That there will be one
5779000	5781000	And also, Microsoft
5781000	5783000	Pro system apparently is gonna be
5783000	5785000	Phased out
5785000	5787000	And something else
5787000	5789000	Will come up in its place
5789000	5791000	Apparently the Pro will be replaced by
5791000	5793000	The 120GB Elite system
5793000	5795000	Now wouldn't it be awesome though if they dropped the price
5795000	5797000	Of the Elite to the price of the Pro system now
5797000	5799000	Then they may come out with something
5799000	5801000	Later on that's even more, maybe something
5801000	5803000	With Project Intel built in
5803000	5805000	I don't know
5805000	5807000	Or maybe a slimmer 360
5807000	5809000	Who knows, that might be neat
5809000	5811000	But apparently
5811000	5813000	The 120GB
5813000	5815000	Or the 120GB Elite
5815000	5817000	Will undergo a price cut
5817000	5819000	In September
5819000	5821000	And there will be some new bundles coming out in October
5821000	5823000	And that makes sense because they're releasing
5823000	5825000	New
5825000	5827000	Bundles all the time
5827000	5829000	By the way
5829000	5831000	I did the research on itoy chat
5831000	5833000	It's kinda hard to figure it out
5833000	5835000	I mean if this game did come out
5835000	5837000	It kinda landed with a thud
5837000	5839000	It only came out in the UK
5839000	5841000	That's what I'm able to kinda put together here
5841000	5843000	Is that it did come out in the UK in 2005
5843000	5845000	That must have been a long time ago
5845000	5847000	I remember selling it so I don't think it actually
5847000	5849000	Came out over here
5849000	5851000	I do remember selling some really stupid things
5851000	5853000	Although itoy chat
5853000	5855000	I don't think was ever one of them
5855000	5857000	Again I hate to bring up an old subject
5857000	5859000	But itoy is what makes me nervous
5859000	5861000	Of things like Project Natal
5861000	5863000	And these other motion controllers
5863000	5865000	Especially Project Natal
5865000	5867000	Is pretty much the Sony motion control
5867000	5869000	Because the Sony motion control feels to me
5869000	5871000	More of a souped up Wii type thing
5871000	5873000	Where there's sensors in the controller itself
5873000	5875000	And the camera
5875000	5877000	But Natal that relies apparently only on a camera
5877000	5879000	It makes me nervous because itoy
5879000	5881000	Was the camera too
5881000	5883000	It was great in theory
5883000	5885000	But look how old that camera technology is
5885000	5887000	And granted yes the Microsoft vision camera was no better
5887000	5889000	Absolutely not better in any way
5889000	5891000	In fact I might argue it was worse
5891000	5893000	At least the itoy actually
5893000	5895000	Might mock the games that came out for it
5895000	5897000	At least it had some sport
5897000	5899000	I believe that the company that they bought
5899000	5901000	I'd rather play itoy chat than totem ball
5903000	5905000	Yes totem ball really sucked
5905000	5909000	And itoy play was kind of okay
5909000	5911000	It was funny
5911000	5913000	And hell we used it for our webcam
5913000	5915000	For a while
5917000	5919000	I'm more confident that they would
5919000	5921000	Test this and test this and test this
5921000	5923000	They're not going to just
5923000	5925000	Splash the market with this
5925000	5927000	Project Natal and have it be shit
5927000	5929000	I mean why would they do that
5929000	5931000	That really opens themselves up
5931000	5933000	Whereas itoy I think was more of like
5933000	5935000	Hey this is kind of neat
5935000	5937000	We'll compete against
5937000	5939000	Somebody with this
5939000	5941000	But they didn't really do anything with it
5941000	5943000	It was just like hey now there's games that use itoy
5943000	5945000	DDR hey there's hands and feet mode
5945000	5947000	Which sucks
5947000	5949000	And yet they decide
5949000	5951000	Hey let's do
5951000	5953000	Wiimote and nunchuck mode
5953000	5955000	Which surprisingly enough also sucks
5955000	5957000	And then
5957000	5959000	Now there's the Wii balance board mode
5959000	5961000	Which also sucks
5961000	5963000	So maybe they should go and learn
5963000	5965000	Their lesson from this which is
5965000	5967000	The extra modes while an interesting idea
5967000	5969000	And maybe slightly consider
5969000	5971000	Innovative maybe
5971000	5973000	As a stretch
5973000	5975000	They will always suck
5975000	5977000	And 8 arrow mode
5977000	5979000	Any guess? It's gonna suck
5979000	5981000	Alright well I'm hearing Loki
5981000	5983000	Getting a little angry over there so I think it might be
5983000	5985000	About time to bring on the FUs of the week
5985000	5987000	But how could we do an FUs of the week segment
5987000	5989000	Without starting it off with a story about a dumb
5989000	5991000	Criminal and yes there was a criminal
5991000	5993000	In Pittsburgh where apparently
5993000	5995000	In the town of East Liberty somebody
5995000	5997000	Tried to break into a GameStop store
5997000	5999000	But they didn't do it the old fashioned way
5999000	6001000	No they climbed in through the ceiling
6001000	6003000	That's right they decided to cut open the ceiling
6003000	6005000	In another I guess nearby place in the shopping center
6005000	6007000	And climbed into the GameStop
6007000	6009000	Basically through the roof but here was the problem
6009000	6011000	Once they got into the store they couldn't
6011000	6013000	Get out because the front door and the back door
6013000	6015000	Were locked and I guess it was not the type of door
6015000	6017000	You can unlock from the inside
6017000	6019000	You need a key to open that up
6019000	6021000	So how did the burglar get out?
6021000	6023000	Well they went back through the hole that they made
6023000	6025000	They climbed back up through the hole
6025000	6027000	They do have surveillance tape but no sign of the criminal yet
6027000	6029000	But the thing that makes this most hilarious
6029000	6031000	Of all they didn't walk away with a damn thing
6031000	6033000	Damn thing
6033000	6035000	So uh
6035000	6037000	This guy just wasted everybody's time
6037000	6039000	In this case and whenever we hear
6039000	6041000	About a dumb criminal I'm sure it always
6041000	6043000	Inspires us to see a little angsty here on the show
6043000	6045000	So uh yeah
6045000	6063000	Let's do the FUs of the week
6063000	6067000	FU to pain and heat
6067000	6071000	Extreme heat
6071000	6073000	Whoops didn't mean to cut the music out there
6073000	6075000	Um it's hot
6075000	6077000	So if you do it being hot
6079000	6081000	I would also say FU to the fact that it's hot
6081000	6083000	Hotter than hell in here
6083000	6085000	Not in here but out there
6085000	6089000	And then I would say FU as well to um
6089000	6091000	Ah I had something else on my mind
6091000	6093000	FU to go to the doctor on my birthday
6093000	6095000	That's no fun who wants to go to the doctor for their birthday?
6097000	6099000	FU to getting old
6099000	6101000	I like the age I was when I started this show
6101000	6103000	24
6103000	6105000	I think I was then
6105000	6107000	31 now what?
6107000	6109000	Things get better in your 30s they really do
6109000	6111000	I hope you're right
6111000	6113000	We'll see
6113000	6115000	First of all you don't have the stupid angst you had in your 20s
6115000	6117000	And you give less of a fuck the older you get
6117000	6119000	I don't know I do still have a lot of that angst
6119000	6121000	Once in a while
6121000	6123000	I take that back
6123000	6125000	I have given less of a fuck the older I get
6125000	6127000	How's that?
6127000	6129000	I don't give a fuck
6129000	6131000	More gaming news

6161000	6163000	Our July releases
6163000	6165000	How's that sound?
6165000	6169000	Oh god did they actually give me any July releases on here?
6169000	6171000	No
6171000	6173000	They're not listening to July releases
6173000	6175000	Well what good is that?
6175000	6177000	Oh there we go
6177000	6179000	Sorry
6179000	6181000	Brain broken sorry
6181000	6183000	The heat has melted her brain
6183000	6185000	God I almost did
6185000	6187000	Punisher No Mercy on Playstation 3
6187000	6189000	We have on the 3rd
6189000	6191000	Call of Juarez
6191000	6193000	Bound in Blood
6193000	6195000	Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
6195000	6197000	On a bunch of systems
6197000	6199000	Street Fighter IV on PC
6199000	6203000	Tiger Woods PGA Tour 10
6203000	6205000	And then
6205000	6207000	That's it
6207000	6209000	Gonna get some Monkey Island after that
6209000	6211000	Sweet
6211000	6213000	Let's get into some Japanese release dates
6213000	6215000	And see what's coming out
6215000	6217000	On the other side of the
6217000	6219000	Pond over across the Pacific
6219000	6221000	Only some price cuts on the
6221000	6223000	Xbox 360 this week for Bioshock
6223000	6225000	Infinite Undiscovery and Shin Sengoku
6225000	6227000	Musou 5 all getting price
6227000	6229000	Cuts this week which I believe that
6229000	6231000	Last one was Dynasty Warriors if not mistaken
6231000	6233000	Yeah that's Dynasty Warriors
6233000	6235000	Empires I think or Dynasty Warriors
6235000	6237000	Five Empires
6237000	6239000	Six Empires
6239000	6241000	That is also getting a price drop on the Playstation 3
6241000	6243000	For the fancy HD systems
6243000	6245000	On the Nintendo Wii this week
6245000	6247000	Grand Slam Tennis
6247000	6249000	Is really the only game you have to look forward to
6249000	6251000	On the Wii this week coming out from EA
6251000	6253000	Looks to be a pretty slow week
6253000	6255000	Over there in Japan but if you are
6255000	6257000	Still a fan of the Playstation 2
6257000	6259000	I got nothing for you this week
6259000	6261000	But there's a baseball game coming out next week
6261000	6263000	You can look for that
6263000	6265000	Coming out on the Nintendo DS
6265000	6267000	We have Mina no Oekake
6267000	6269000	Yasan
6269000	6271000	This is going to be some type of drawing game
6271000	6273000	Because I recognize the Oekake from being that whole
6273000	6275000	Drawing on the internet thing
6275000	6277000	That looks to be exactly what this is
6277000	6279000	Probably some type of like share with your friends drawing
6279000	6281000	Draw a penis on the internet
6281000	6283000	It looks like it's teaching you how to draw Oekake
6283000	6285000	Is what it's doing because I see this little like
6285000	6287000	It's walking you through how to draw
6287000	6289000	Like a happy little sheep there
6289000	6291000	So that looks like a fun little game
6291000	6293000	It's like painting training
6293000	6295000	I guess you could call that game
6295000	6297000	That's really it on the DS
6297000	6299000	Anything on the PSP
6299000	6301000	I guess this is a slow week when your biggest release
6301000	6303000	Is an Oekake game
6303000	6305000	Oh well they do have this game
6305000	6307000	Hatsune Miku Project Diva
6307000	6309000	Comes out for Sega this week
6309000	6311000	You know what Hatsune Miku is right?
6311000	6313000	The Vocaloid
6313000	6315000	You know where
6315000	6317000	You input the words
6317000	6319000	The tune and everything and then she sings it
6319000	6321000	This looks to be yeah a type of music game
6321000	6323000	Actually coming out over there
6323000	6325000	Having what's it on?
6325000	6327000	PSP
6327000	6329000	Yeah having the Vocaloid game on PSP is pretty cool
6329000	6331000	Rob really you should
6331000	6333000	I'm gonna find you something to play
6333000	6335000	Interesting yeah you actually
6335000	6337000	Kinda this is a rhythm game that you
6337000	6339000	Put in these
6339000	6341000	Kinda another type of syncing game
6341000	6343000	And it makes your dance
6343000	6345000	So check that out
6345000	6347000	That would be a big release coming out this week
6347000	6349000	Over there in Japan
6349000	6351000	That's it for Japanese release dates
6351000	6353000	In the US there's
6353000	6355000	Kata and Half-Blood Prince
6355000	6357000	Which will be on all platforms
6357000	6359000	Available for gaming
6359000	6361000	Steam Bot Chronicles Battle Tournament
6361000	6363000	On the PSP
6363000	6365000	So a free release of that
6365000	6367000	Or at least a port of the game I guess
6367000	6369000	Street Fighter IV on PC
6369000	6371000	Two Mega Man Star Force games
6371000	6373000	Mega Man Star Force 3
6373000	6375000	Red Joker
6375000	6377000	And Black Ace
6377000	6379000	Also
6379000	6381000	Ice Age Dawn of the Diasaurs
6381000	6383000	Which all platforms
6383000	6385000	And Grand Theft Auto 3
6385000	6387000	Or I should say Grand Theft Auto 3
6387000	6389000	Vice City
6389000	6391000	And San Andreas are all coming
6391000	6393000	Together in a brand new
6393000	6395000	PC trilogy that's being pre-released
6395000	6397000	Call of War is Bound in Blood
6397000	6399000	On PS3 and Xbox 360
6399000	6401000	Treasure World
6401000	6403000	Which is a DS game that uses
6403000	6405000	Your Wi-Fi signals to find treasure
6405000	6407000	That's kinda neat
6407000	6409000	So that'll be coming out in the DS
6409000	6411000	Ruger Twisted Towers
6411000	6413000	On the Wii
6413000	6415000	And I believe there's another Ruger game
6415000	6417000	Coming out in DS
6417000	6419000	Now this is a sequel to an Xbox Live Arcade game isn't it?
6419000	6421000	I think so
6421000	6423000	Blaze Blue Calamity Trigger
6423000	6425000	Sort of a launch
6425000	6427000	Limited editions coming out on
6427000	6429000	PS3 and Xbox 360 as well
6429000	6431000	Ummm
6431000	6433000	Let's see
6433000	6435000	And then a smaller
6435000	6437000	360 game that not a lot of people have heard about
6437000	6439000	Infernal Hell's Vengeance
6439000	6441000	Which was on PC a little bit earlier this year
6441000	6443000	That's making its way out to
6443000	6445000	Xbox 360 at a budget
6445000	6447000	$39.99
6447000	6449000	I guess that's not really too budget
6449000	6451000	More budget than full price
6451000	6453000	Ruger Attack which is on the DS
6453000	6455000	Also another Ruger sequel
6455000	6457000	Ummm
6457000	6459000	And then that's it for this week
6459000	6461000	I'm kind of happy to see
6461000	6463000	Arma 2 is coming out next week
6463000	6465000	And I still haven't gotten a chance to play the
6465000	6467000	Actual
6467000	6469000	Steam version but
6469000	6471000	Looks cool
6471000	6473000	Alright so backing up to the Japanese release
6473000	6475000	States a little bit, Dark Soccer you sent me this YouTube
6475000	6477000	What the hell is this I'm about to look at here?
6477000	6479000	This is what the
6479000	6481000	Vocaloid is like
6481000	6483000	You're gonna turn it up
6483000	6485000	Oh
6489000	6491000	This is just some really
6491000	6493000	Weird version of Don't Worry Be Happy
6493000	6495000	Well I picked something in English
6495000	6497000	But you input the words
6497000	6499000	And the tune and everything
6499000	6501000	And it plays it back like she's
6501000	6503000	Singing and she's your virtual idol
6503000	6505000	Oh interesting
6505000	6507000	So you're actually like pushing the buttons to sing?
6507000	6509000	No you just input everything
6509000	6511000	Ahead of time and then
6511000	6513000	Watch it play through
6513000	6515000	If there's one of her doing
6515000	6517000	Caramel dancing I'll find it
6517000	6519000	No thank you that's alright
6519000	6521000	But I think that's
6521000	6523000	The music maker
6523000	6525000	Well the PC ones are I don't know exactly
6525000	6527000	How the PSP one is going to be
6527000	6529000	But ever since the first one came out
6529000	6531000	There's been a ton of
6531000	6533000	New Vocaloids and
6533000	6535000	Everything it's pretty big
6539000	6541000	I think this is what a Dark Soccer
6541000	6543000	One is going to show
6543000	6545000	I think that's an
6545000	6555000	Animation that someone did
6555000	6557000	I'm going to park really cute
6557000	6559000	But yeah
6559000	6561000	Alright let's get back into some more
6561000	6563000	News, Loki you got anything for us?
6563000	6565000	Yeah sure why not
6565000	6567000	Apparently EEA
6567000	6569000	Is calling their Sims 3 leak
6569000	6571000	It's demo program
6571000	6573000	Saying that
6573000	6575000	You know you've identified our
6575000	6577000	Secret marketing campaign
6577000	6579000	EA CEO John
6579000	6581000	I'm not even going to try to pronounce
6581000	6583000	His last name
6583000	6585000	Ricotelio I guess
6585000	6587000	That was actually pretty accurate
6587000	6589000	It's a large scale
6589000	6591000	Form of large scale
6591000	6593000	Large scale piracy I guess
6593000	6595000	Was a pre-release version of
6595000	6597000	The Sims 3
6597000	6599000	Basically saying that
6599000	6601000	It was a way to
6601000	6603000	I guess
6603000	6605000	Figure out
6605000	6607000	Some data and stuff from this experiment
6607000	6609000	That they may
6609000	6611000	They've gotten a lot of people to buy the game
6611000	6613000	Based on trying this version of the game
6613000	6615000	That leaked out I guess
6615000	6617000	Apparently if you're a pirate consumer
6617000	6619000	They don't get the second town
6619000	6621000	They don't get all the extra content
6621000	6623000	And they don't get the community
6623000	6625000	That's bullshit
6625000	6627000	Yes that sounds like complete shit to me too
6627000	6629000	Because basically that's all download content
6629000	6631000	Funny enough
6631000	6633000	Funny enough that he would say that it's a pre-release version
6633000	6635000	Because right after the game came out
6635000	6637000	That version got leaked too
6637000	6639000	So oh shit
6639000	6641000	Guess that's not a real
6641000	6643000	I don't know
6643000	6645000	That didn't fix any problems
6645000	6647000	I think it sounds to me like they're making excuses
6647000	6649000	Because a leak like this
6649000	6651000	Had to have come from inside
6651000	6653000	Since it was leaked out like
6653000	6655000	Weeks early
6655000	6657000	He's doing a cover your ass
6657000	6659000	And it just makes him
6659000	6661000	Sound pathetic
6661000	6663000	So well
6663000	6665000	Hey whatever makes you sleep better at night
6665000	6667000	I guess
6667000	6669000	Yeah it kind of
6669000	6671000	Sounds more like uh oops
6671000	6673000	How do we explain this one or something
6673000	6675000	Ha ha ha you fell for it
6675000	6677000	Well I think what he's saying
6677000	6679000	Also too is what they're going to try to move towards
6679000	6681000	Later on
6681000	6683000	Is selling more services
6683000	6685000	So meaning like a game like this
6685000	6687000	Where you buy a lot of extra additional content
6687000	6689000	And stuff
6689000	6691000	And I think hey that's not a bad idea
6691000	6693000	If you want to say release the game for free
6693000	6695000	And then have download content
6695000	6697000	That you pay for that makes sense
6697000	6699000	But
6699000	6701000	At the end of the day what's going to end up happening
6701000	6703000	Except they'll probably not sell a lot of that
6703000	6705000	And you know what else is going to happen at the end of the day
6705000	6707000	Just like all the expansions for Sims 2
6707000	6709000	Those will get leaked out as well
6709000	6711000	So all your plans for
6711000	6713000	Download content
6713000	6715000	Will work
6715000	6717000	Just to say also everything that's available
6717000	6719000	On the Sims 3 store
6719000	6721000	Is available for download through BitTorrent
6721000	6723000	People have already done it
6723000	6725000	People are already doing
6725000	6727000	It's just
6727000	6729000	It's just
6729000	6731000	Really starting but people are already starting to do
6731000	6733000	A few custom items already
6733000	6735000	It's not going to be too
6735000	6737000	Too much longer
6737000	6739000	You can download everything
6739000	6741000	That's there in the store
6741000	6743000	But if you really like the game
6743000	6745000	You should just go buy it
6745000	6747000	I bought my game
6747000	6749000	Encourage them to make a Sims 4
6749000	6751000	Although Sims 4 is probably inevitable
6751000	6753000	Someday
6753000	6755000	Many years down the line
6755000	6757000	I just want a nice graphical upgrade to Sims 2
6757000	6759000	Sequel to successful franchise?
6759000	6761000	Nah
6761000	6763000	Well speaking of sequels to successful franchises
6763000	6765000	I want them to make pretty faces
6765000	6767000	And better hair
6767000	6769000	Well I want pretty faces and better hair
6769000	6771000	To play that game again
6771000	6773000	No not really not with Final Fantasy 14 on the horizon
6773000	6775000	But Final Fantasy 11 has been getting some crap
6775000	6777000	This week
6777000	6779000	Apparently they got sued this week for 5 million dollars
6779000	6781000	Apparently it's because they
6781000	6783000	Supposedly
6783000	6785000	Allegedly I guess is the word to use
6785000	6787000	They did to 100,000 customers
6787000	6789000	Deceived them for unfair business practices
6789000	6791000	False advertising
6791000	6793000	And unjust enrichment
6793000	6795000	This is Esther Leong
6795000	6797000	Who filed the suit in San Francisco
6797000	6799000	Claims that Square Enix
6799000	6801000	Lied about or concealed its monthly fees
6801000	6803000	Penalties for late payments
6803000	6805000	Interest restrictions and other things
6805000	6807000	That should have been fully disclosed
6807000	6809000	At points of purchase
6809000	6811000	So that's why they're saying they're deceptive
6811000	6813000	And if you go on to read the court filing
6813000	6815000	It actually goes on to detail it a little more
6815000	6817000	Saying among others
6817000	6819000	There's deceptive advertising, unfair and undisclosed
6819000	6821000	Business practices, here's a list
6821000	6823000	8 items on the list
6823000	6825000	Licensing of the online game software disguised as a sale
6825000	6827000	Monthly fees or fees to play the online games
6829000	6831000	Penalties for late payment of the fees
6831000	6833000	Interest charges for late payment of the fees
6833000	6835000	Charges while the online game account is suspended
6835000	6837000	Termination of the right to use the online games for late payment of the fees
6837000	6841000	User restrictions and conditions related to the online games
6843000	6845000	Termination of game data for payment of the fees
6845000	6847000	Granted, that's not like on the box
6847000	6849000	But yeah, it's all in their little fact
6849000	6851000	But that's after you bought the game
6851000	6853000	But at this point
6853000	6856320	at this point when did he buy this game because you know nowadays you can get
6856320	6862480	this game and all the expansions for like 20 bucks I mean and really is $20
6862480	6866440	worth you know suing over I don't know and so if you will sue about anything
6866440	6871000	and if you didn't make your payments well who's fault is that stupid I
6871000	6875440	actually whether or not you purchased the game it's sort of like when you
6875440	6878960	keep in mind I work in the mortgage industry it's like when you go buy your
6878960	6883440	house you know you can pick out your house and you can make all the
6883440	6886400	arrangements to purchase that house but you have to sign the agreement to
6886400	6890360	actually be able to live in your house you know and in your agreement it says
6890360	6894840	that you are paying for this this and this that your lender has the right to
6894840	6897120	church this isn't this if you don't do shit
6897120	6901240	guess what same way in that type of contract you have to read it
6901240	6904760	this person has no right to sue she's completely responsible for her own and
6904760	6908920	and they they even ask you when you're signing up did you know be sure to read
6908920	6914760	this contract do you accept these terms and you know whatever it's not their
6914760	6917320	fault she didn't read it well this is what I don't understand I played this
6917320	6923040	game for three years I had when I never heard of them charging interest not a
6923040	6927320	single person in my league shall ever talked about this if it is really late
6927320	6933040	payments I guess but if you pay late there's no paying late you pay a lot of
6933040	6937520	pay disable your account you want to pay right and if your credit card bounces or
6937520	6943640	whatever you can log in yeah but like I don't know do they charge you before the
6943640	6947360	new month is up say like I pay for a month or whatever like that they charge
6947360	6949480	in the beginning of the other month because if they charge me at the end of
6949480	6952560	the month then you know you've paid for that month and you have you owe the
6952560	6956240	money I guess for that I think the beginning of the month makes sense I
6956240	6960880	don't understand I think we need to hear more about what's the way it's worded it
6960880	6964880	makes it sound like a dummy and on top of all that five million dollars really
6964880	6969280	for something that sounds like that they just fucked up and didn't pay their bill
6969280	6975960	customer service could just resolved well maybe that's the problem but you
6975960	6979440	know I don't know yeah five million dollars a little extreme but I mean if
6979440	6983460	it's being split among a hundred thousand people is class action right so
6983460	6986340	technically all hundred thousand should be entitled to their chunk of it so they
6986340	6991560	all get what 50 bucks a pop 5,000 is that much I can't do math sorry yeah
6991560	6996440	but still well wait I think it's still 50 times a hundred thousand I think it's
6996440	7001640	still highly frivolous well it's still a 50 bucks that's you know and they're not
7001640	7008240	gonna get $50 either because lawyers got to get paid I've let's see going in chat
7008240	7013220	for our comments chat that orange entree calm Joshi 16 in chat says people sue
7013220	7020840	over $0 GS 68 says people make patents sit on them then sue GS 68 is saying he's
7020840	7024260	gonna patent eighth-generation game consoles then get ready to sue Sony
7024260	7029760	Microsoft and Nintendo so we'll see how that works out for you how about the
7029760	7033400	mailbag I think it's time we get to some emails you haven't even have an email
7033400	7036680	bag yet all right we do one more story then we get to the meal yeah I'm pulling
7036680	7040000	it now look you got another story for us in the meantime yes apparently there's
7040000	7044200	an off-broadway play that's been inspired by adventure games apparently
7044200	7050720	it's a how off-broadway pretty off-broadway I guess it's called
7050720	7055460	adventure quest and explores the convention set by Sierra's adventure
7055460	7060040	games back in time of well the 90s I guess how is that different from like
7060040	7066600	just a fairy tale I don't know it's sort of like I guess into the woods they say
7066600	7072160	oh yeah I know that play that's that's kind of a spoof on well I guess fairy
7072160	7076120	tales actually is what into the woods is about yeah but apparently I guess this
7076120	7080000	is currently playing at the brick theater as part of the anti-depressant
7080000	7084840	festival and it will be part of their theaters gameplay celebration in which
7084840	7089000	they have a they will have a variety of video game related performances
7089000	7094000	including let's take a look here this has got to be one of those theaters
7094000	7098640	that's like only seats 20 people in it you know like it's a real tiny tiny
7098640	7103240	community theater I can't imagine this is a big production they're gonna have
7103240	7108200	yes the gameplay celebration is apparently three performances executed
7108200	7112560	through video games in video game styles three video game or three game party
7112560	7118240	nights and three weeks of rot your brain video game madness and apparently their
7118240	7123400	video game party nights include an MMORPG night where you will play your
7123400	7129200	favorite massively multiplayer online role-playing game in theater rock band
7129200	7134280	karaoke and then another night will be a chiptunes dance party that sounds fun
7134280	7138800	but this sounds so off-broadway it's like in New Jersey what's kind of neat
7138800	7144440	though is like what they have like it's live actors on stage with like no set
7144440	7148960	work and then the sets are actually like artwork from like adventure games which
7148960	7154600	is kind of neat okay that's kind of neat I guess what a bunch of nerds but I can
7154600	7157840	applaud where I want to talk and they actually it's kind of cool they've got
7157840	7164320	like a little score tally running and nice all right we ready for some emails
7164320	7168000	yeah all right whenever you want to interact with the show mailbag at
7168000	7171600	orangeslaunasrated.com is a great place to do it we jump in there and read some
7171600	7174440	of your emails every week the lovely dark soccer is gonna dive in the mailbag

7178560	7182680	Rob mailbag at orangeslaunasrated.com
7186920	7192120	first email I just listened to last week's show and I would compare it more
7192120	7195560	to doom and the start of the first-person shooter genres about being
7195560	7200480	a BB&A versus DJ hero when a new when a new game genre first appears to the
7200480	7204400	general public it seems like the best way to classify is by calling it a clone
7204400	7209120	of the first most popular game in the genre for more recent example look at
7209120	7213920	how sandbox games were called GTA clones until a few years ago and that's from
7213920	7219480	Corky842 who also sends an addendum ps the last email was brought to you by
7219480	7227120	beer in the palm pre Wow I don't know if I have a lot else to add to that that's
7227120	7230840	an interesting comparison I didn't even think of the doom like the whole like
7230840	7234760	doom quake Wolfenstein type of connection last week but very interesting
7234760	7247680	point um cheeseburger says I miss MJ dude you're too young this one says hey
7247680	7253080	y'all I downloaded the new iPod touch firmware tonight first of all I paid 10
7253080	7258760	bucks for this why is this really good or am I an apple lemming or both the
7258760	7262160	second this update actually looks interesting the copy and paste is not
7262160	7267000	really what I'm used to but what was I expecting parental controls are good if
7267000	7272240	you're a parent as I am NOT it's useless to me the shake to shuffle feature is
7272240	7278920	nice though and really useful when my baby's crying album kicks in well that
7278920	7286120	that's awesome for Apple to charge for firmware updates I didn't pay for mine
7286120	7290840	you don't pay on the phones you only pay on the I touch or whatever oh well how
7290840	7296840	generous of them I know I don't care I have the phone yes third assuming you
7296840	7301040	didn't cut me off with the baby comment they've done something to improve typing
7301040	7305320	messages and I love them for it landscape typing makes the buttons
7305320	7309000	noticeably bigger and improvement that helps me a lot now I don't miss type
7309000	7312400	every other word yay well that's all for now
7312400	7319000	steak hair entertainment this message was typed an iPod touch which I have and
7319000	7324320	you don't ask yeah I have an iPhone actually I do really like the the
7324320	7332600	upgrade I like having five panels for my apps instead of the three and I'm pretty
7332600	7337120	pleased with it pretty pleased also I really like some of the changes that
7337120	7341920	they've made to the it's okay I like that I can text and landscape now that's
7341920	7345960	the biggest new improvement same with email but I'm not liking the fact that
7345960	7349240	the phone just seems to run slower like I guess with all that stuff in there
7349240	7352880	like a lot of my apps feel like they're running slower but I'm hoping that'll
7352880	7358160	get showing an improvement I'm hoping that with the 3.1 that's inevitable at
7358160	7362320	some point you know the minor tweaks that'll fix that all up that's what I
7362320	7368560	hope next email sure dear olr crew I just wanted to briefly chime in on
7368560	7372880	something you went over last week that being guitar hero Van Halen I remember
7372880	7377520	when they announced the game I was actually somewhat interested though that
7377520	7381840	interest dropped completely when it said the game was Van Halen and not Van
7381840	7388040	Hagar you know what I love Sammy Hagar most the music by them that I love is
7388040	7391120	when Sammy Hagar was the lead singer there's only a couple of songs that I
7391120	7396480	enjoyed that were when David Lee Roth was singing with the group I completely
7396480	7401200	agree with this by the way and so I suppose that in the opinion of many I'm
7401200	7406520	not a true fan of the group that is just my own musical taste perhaps now there
7406520	7410080	might be an opportunity for rock band to pick up the remaining music I'd freaking
7410080	7414880	love to play dreams thanks for reading it's always awesome for PS I just want
7414880	7418760	to know that it was very painful news on Thursday June 25th when Michael Jackson
7418760	7423020	died may he rest in peace but forever live on through his music and what a
7423020	7426420	great tribute that would be if harmonics gave us the real of the thriller album
7426420	7431800	is rock band DLC don't count on it now on a wishful thinking I realize
7431800	7436320	everybody's still wrapped up you know I don't want to get into this topic but
7436320	7439880	everybody's still wrapped up in the Michael Jackson thing don't count on it
7439880	7443240	something like that is gonna be years and years in the making because guess
7443240	7448160	what to the rights to that stuff now it's all gonna be up in the air with the
7448160	7452600	debt that man left behind if rumors are to be believed it these type of
7452600	7458360	struggles will go on for years did you see misty sent us clips no I didn't
7458360	7461840	misty sent us a bunch of clips I think that you should hop into the mailbag too
7461840	7467440	I might oh my gosh Wow I might have to play those during the afterbirth night
7467440	7476700	all right okay Thank You misty well I thought he's so rich but his company's
7476700	7481400	bankrupt kind of I to be honest I don't know nor do I feel like it's any my
7481400	7486000	business I kind of don't care but you know I sound rude but you know it's not
7486000	7489360	my finances I got I got my own finances to worry about well we've got two more
7489360	7494840	emails hi lol crew this is your friendly neighborhood Mexican act daft first of
7494840	7498320	all I want to congratulate you for your seventh anniversary I've been listening
7498320	7503000	to the show since 2005 though I became a regular since 2006 around episode 200 I
7503000	7508720	wish you the best for the years to come thank you acts daft well now to business
7508720	7514480	ooh so serious well we have all seen and heard the news on the newest DDR and the
7514480	7519260	latest Bemani news and how disappointing it has been how DDR has burned to the
7519260	7522680	ground and possibly lost its appeal to the true old fans of the series and
7522680	7527400	localization of pop music in the States which is a joke for those who know about
7527400	7531920	the game well call me crazy and stuff but now I'm glad Konami didn't bring
7531920	7536080	guitar freaks in germania stateside that way we got guitar hero and rock band
7536080	7539800	which are truly great and haven't lost their appeal to the public no matter how
7539800	7543640	much activision is milking guitar hero though they did bring guitar freaks
7543640	7549240	germania to this you know side of the pond I guess in the arcades yes in the
7549240	7555200	arcades but also as rock revolution unfortunately that doesn't count I still
7555200	7558160	look at because no one cared about that anyway I still wondered what would have
7558160	7563880	happened if konami would konami bro guitar Dora but considering how rock
7563880	7568080	revolution did see there we go I'm glad they didn't granted it wouldn't have
7568080	7572400	been the same game but still look at the way DDR and pop music are going not good
7572400	7576360	at all and a guitar freaks germania would have taken the same route and
7576360	7580740	doomed the rhythm games for years to come so thank you konami for not giving
7580740	7584980	us guitar freaks in germania rock revolution proved what it what it would
7584980	7588960	have happened to guitar over the years now don't screw up and don't release
7588960	7593760	another bad part of beat mania because of scratch and DJ hero heck forget about
7593760	7598360	the money in the States and let k set jay do their thing at least they know if
7598360	7603800	the record breaks don't try to fix it thanks thanks for reading this email
7603800	7607560	again congrats on the seven years entertaining the internet every Sunday
7607560	7612080	PS adjacent Enos were dead he'd be rolling in his grave right now well he's
7612080	7617720	not he's alive and well he's um he's at EA now I think I can say that he's moved
7617720	7624200	on to a better place yes um look I I don't know if I agree very much with the
7624200	7629480	whole rock revolution is what guitar freaks would have become like although I
7629480	7633120	can totally see the point about maybe if this game had come out first it would
7633120	7636840	have hurt the chances for things in the future I can sort of kind of go with
7636840	7640600	that I guess but I don't think that rock revolution would have happened if it
7640600	7644480	weren't for guitar freaks I think I don't think rock revolution honestly
7644480	7649040	outside of music alone I don't think it had anything to do with guitar freaks at
7649040	7655000	all rock revolution was an attempt to make a copy of guitar hero and use the
7655000	7658920	Bahmani brand to do it knowing that they wouldn't be able to say anything about
7658920	7662200	it because Konami did have guitar freaks they did have the Bahmani
7662200	7669400	thing and just that they just just piss poor execution stop being lazy and
7669400	7673040	hopefully you know they're learning their lesson when it's this is this game
7673040	7677800	is an embarrassment rock revolution was there's really no nice way for me to say
7677800	7682160	it with as much nice things as you know Konami has put out in the past and
7682160	7686200	people that I even know there and so on there is no nice way for me to say it
7686200	7691880	rock revolution was an embarrassment to that company and it should never happen
7691880	7698040	again anyhow any more emails oh yes we did
7698040	7704680	last one hey Rob Jamie and Matt this is longtime listener SSJ 100 Matt I first
7704680	7709640	wanted to congratulate and praise you on your seventh anniversary it's amazing
7709640	7713800	that it was a little less than six years ago that I first started listening to
7713800	7718000	the show I first discovered OLR through a friend who recommended the now long
7718000	7722000	defunct Wednesday show outside the box from there I discovered the Sunday show
7722000	7726120	and the rest was history I know you guys get enough praise as it is and for the
7726120	7730400	sake of this email I will keep it short no I like praise keep keep it I like
7730400	7734800	that somebody remembers outside the box I barely remember that show that's crazy
7734800	7738680	I was a sideshow I hosted years ago with some friends and you three have
7738680	7742000	sacrificed seven years of your Sunday nights for the sake of us the listener

7992080	7997000	looking at these other long clips here Rob with candy full what the hell is
7997000	8001200	this speaking of dirty things though guess what happened hmm it's a guy he

8011000	8014680	emails on this I already know no okay okay absolutely there is an in joke
8014680	8021000	about candy in one of my circles so anyway a 31 year old employee of Tecmo
8021000	8026720	said that our dear friend who was behind that are alive was basically sexually
8026720	8038480	harassing her the compensation she is looking for anyway she's seeking
8038480	8046320	compensation in 10 million what the hell it's candy get it this candy is not so
8046320	8052840	delicious huh huh wow let's see one more here offensive things you've missed I
8052840	8056120	like the word offensive Linda woman she's literally sent like a ton of clips
8056120	8059560	I I could we could just sit here and play these all night long and we'd have
8059560	8062040	like a whole show full of stuff let me do this and we'll do some more video
8062040	8064800	game stories let's see offensive things you've missed some of you guys may be
8064800	8067880	thinking well didn't you guys used to do the rewinds on your own damn station
8067880	8072240	sky yeah actually that's true but now it is the oldie and moldy Wednesday
8072240	8075840	flashback where we are 100 episodes behind right now so you can hear what
8075840	8080720	the show sounded like two years ago it's pretty nuts I kind of looked at the chat
8080720	8084320	and some of the response to last week's episode and I think I think Missy or
8084320	8087640	somebody had said it's a good thing I wasn't there because I would have ripped
8087640	8092280	them a new asshole so so here what offensive things you missed out on on
8092280	8096160	back on episodes 20 and 21 and all that stuff we're playing way back when so
8096160	8100040	check it out it was on our old old station we used to play shows that were
8100040	8104600	like three years old and I don't even know like a we lost a ton of shows when
8104600	8108600	one of our hard drives went out so it's which is a bummer they might still be
8108600	8111560	around you know who added me on Twitter the other day was DDR angel and if
8111560	8115200	anybody has older well our episodes between her and misty we could probably
8115200	8122240	find them all anyway alright so anyhow yay clip fun let's do a few more stories
8122240	8125520	than I guess we'll go to Skype at some point here we've done all the other
8125520	8129040	segments we need to do tonight right we did if used in mailbag really states
8129040	8133160	alright how about a few more stories then you're you you did all yours right
8133160	8139400	our soccer um yeah okay so look you have a few more forms yes apparently there is
8139400	8145760	a brand new game entering the wrestling game genre and this is being put out by
8145760	8153120	immersion software on the Wii PSP and DS I'm sorry that's by a different
8153120	8158480	Argentine developer as Sabasa studios but anyways immersion software they're
8158480	8164000	putting out on the 360 ps3 it is a lucha libre game yes that's right is actually
8164000	8172040	gonna be based on the triple-a wrestling circuit and yes it's basically triple-a
8172040	8178880	the video game and it's got all sorts of lucha libre stars including on the
8178880	8189800	screenshot here it looks like looks like l la Guido and psycho clown because who
8189800	8193840	doesn't like a psycho clown oh and they have a teaser trailer up which I haven't
8193840	8207960	seen yet but it looks awesome as long as they have was it as sent us he's got to
8207960	8214400	be in there I don't follow this crap so I that's why I'm I know I don't this
8214400	8219880	makes no sense to me but okay you boys have your fun it's Mexican wrestlers
8219880	8227840	will be awesome hey I'm not down you I'm just saying I'm not a fan well I'm not a
8227840	8231600	fan of it either but it's Mexican wrestlers I mean hell they have was it
8231600	8238000	the also the Santos line of videos you know it's a Mexican wrestler who's like
8238000	8243480	solving mysteries and stuff like that I mean that's just cheesy and weird you
8243480	8246400	know what you want to know a Mexican wrestler that was badass did you ever
8246400	8251440	play Saturday Night Slam Masters no there was a wrestler in that game and I
8251440	8255440	can't remember his name he was the guy they had this game at my local pizza
8255440	8262960	parlor and oh my god it was so much fun yeah we used to play that a lot what was
8262960	8266280	the name of that guy I'm trying to look it up on Wikipedia right now El sting
8266280	8273280	ray I was his name good times one of the guys from final fight was in the game
8273280	8279680	the mayor of Hagar yeah Hagar was in Saturday Night Slam Masters good times
8279680	8284920	so we got a couple more stories we ready to open up skype line what we doing
8284920	8289800	Skype it well Skype it were there any of the big stories we haven't got to yet
8289800	8293960	Loki or do you think we got it all code who's coming out next week at some point
8293960	8299040	that's at a game making software that's going to be available on Xbox community
8299040	8303120	or indie games whatever it's called at the moment really for 400 Microsoft
8303120	8307320	points five bucks hell yes I will be picking that up that's supposed to be
8307320	8309840	coming out sometime around June 30th they're actually going through the same
8309840	8314680	peer review process as every other developer has to go through so they're
8314680	8319680	targeting it for some time June 30th ish you know might not be exactly June 30th
8319680	8326960	but that's kind of cool very cool let me cover a couple quick stories here real
8326960	8330680	quick before we go to the Skype line let's see our con is coming to the
8330680	8333880	iPhone which makes me very happy because I remember this game for the Commodore
8333880	8337640	64 I think it actually did just come out because my friend was showing me that he
8337640	8343320	bought it the other day it is out for $4 for the iPhone and the iPod touch and
8343320	8348280	that is available no multiplayer sadly but you can download this and play it on
8348280	8353120	the iPhone I'm wondering how smoothly it runs but yeah oh god I'd love to our con
8353120	8355700	I know I've talked about on the show before it was like it was like chess but
8355700	8359840	the pieces would actually battle each other but not like regular chess you had
8359840	8364480	different types of pieces like basilisks and unicorns and shape shifters and all
8364480	8368960	this cool stuff well I've got a few more stories here real quick sure there's a
8368960	8372280	rumor that one versus 100 is coming out of beta next week and we'll actually be
8372280	8379840	giving prizes so that'd be cool ah I bet that's not true I think there's gonna be
8379840	8383360	more of a build-up to it than just oh hey next week prizes I think they'll be
8383360	8387440	more of a build-up I know I heard that the guy supposedly said something
8387440	8392000	whatever it doesn't mean anything bit trip core is gonna be coming out in two
8392000	8397280	weeks and they'll be the 100th we wear game on the service that's kind of neat
8397280	8400720	bit trip beat was kind of cool I'm wondering how this is gonna be different
8400720	8403920	I said are they changing anything it's a totally different type of game
8403920	8410440	interesting yeah okay and of course I'm sure you saw this already
8410440	8416700	Namco networks is giving burger time an update with burger time deluxe yes I
8416700	8421080	heard about this I've heard a lot of people call it crap but burger time was
8421080	8425000	an awesome game in the 80s but you know even I can admit it's probably one of
8425000	8430320	those things that's better left in the 80s but I will check this out but it
8430320	8433880	just looks like the old game was souped up graphics in new stages which you know
8433880	8437280	it's not like the stages are that complicated yeah it's probably and then
8437280	8440160	finally last thing oh actually got two things
8440160	8445040	Bethesda their parent company bought ID software so now that's kind of under the
8445040	8450040	whole ZeniMax I guess was the company that owns Bethesda now they own it's
8450040	8457840	software as well and apparently the next two games rage and Wolfenstein obviously
8457840	8462320	are gonna be published under their respective publishers EA and Activision
8462320	8466840	but now all the further games are being published under probably like Bethesda
8466840	8470760	or something like that I don't know ZeniMax unless ZeniMax has come out as a
8470760	8477160	new publisher I guess apparently if you were a subscriber to EGM and since EGM
8477160	8481720	is kind of gone right now your subscriptions were converted into Maxim
8481720	8486880	subscriptions which I think is a fair trade if you ask me so that's kind of
8486880	8492840	neat and then still yet another survey suggesting that Netflix streaming is
8492840	8496880	coming to the Wii the only difference we get this damn survey like every six
8496880	8500920	months the only difference now is instead of a one-time fee of $9.99 it
8500920	8506000	will be free so you will not have to purchase a streaming disc but hey if it
8506000	8510160	happens it happens cool and then finally Ubisoft that would make the Wii a little
8510160	8513760	more lucrative than 360 because you wouldn't have to have gold very true
8513760	8518520	that that's a that's a big feather in Wii's cap don't underestimate that
8518520	8524200	don't underestimate that can't do HD streaming though for most you know what
8524200	8528520	considering the type of stuff that's there and I'm just gonna say don't
8528520	8532920	underestimate that I'm very critical of the Wii on this show but that could be
8532920	8536520	big free Netflix essentially if you already have a Netflix account Rob how
8536520	8540520	long does it take for the internet browser to load up and you know the Wii
8540520	8543720	I mean what if they can if you'll whip it if they can figure out the
8543720	8546880	connectivity that makes you know games like Super Smash Brothers and stuff work
8546880	8552840	for like kids programming and non HD type stuff again don't underestimate it
8552840	8556920	Matt all right big and then finally a Ubisoft's collaboration with Q
8556920	8562400	Entertainment they are like it's likely to be a music game but me really when
8562400	8567280	you look at odds Q entertain exactly I mean unless it's 99 nights to which is
8567280	8571200	somehow doubt no all right look our skype lines already ringing off the
8571200	8574080	hook and I really want to get to that very soon but one other quick story for
8574080	8578200	you guys if I could Marvel vs. Capcom 2 big rumors out there that the game was
8578200	8583680	coming out June 29th not true per the Twitter's official Capcom Twitter is not
8583680	8586640	coming out June 29th they don't know where the rumor came from well let me
8586640	8589880	tell you it was from Marvel's financial reports you might want to look at that
8589880	8592880	but they're saying now it's closer to the end of July that the game will
8592880	8596680	actually come out so sorry if you guys were looking forward to that one but
8596680	8599440	it's not coming out that makes sense so because I think wasn't it part of the
8599440	8602520	summer of arcade or something like that and that doesn't start until like the
8602520	8606360	end of July anyways yeah I don't know all right look our phone is ringing off
8606360	8609480	the hook let's get let's get some calls done tonight hi you're on orange on
8609480	8613360	this radio who's this saying that it calls it almost every single week from
8613360	8616200	the East Coast I don't know how you get through every time but I'll tell you
8616200	8619640	what I've seen like seven different names pop up in the corners so you're
8619640	8624320	lucky tonight what's on your mind that much at first I want to say happy
8624320	8629000	anniversary to you guys happy birthday congratulations thank you we're seven so
8629000	8632920	we should be having this anniversary show at Chuck E Cheese yes but you're
8632920	8637720	still immature as a seven-year-old should be mm-hmm what's on your mind
8637720	8645040	tonight buddy I have a question about e3 um before you guys went you have made a
8645040	8649640	statement about how you felt III wasn't going to be the same yeah like different
8649640	8655800	feelings intake about about before you went did you feel the same way when you
8655800	8660520	went or what are you talking about the show itself or what I was kind of
8660520	8664280	lamenting about that nobody I knew was really going so it was going to be a
8664280	8668160	little weird this year a little bit of column a and a little bit of column B
8668160	8673880	the show itself I actually think was better it was better than most of the
8673880	8678040	prior years because I felt like I actually got time to play games the
8678040	8683160	lines were obscenely long I think whatever they did to kind of and I don't
8683160	8686960	know this might be in part because the economy but I think whatever they did to
8686960	8690080	kind of filter out some of the people that didn't really need to be there and
8690080	8693800	someone might argue maybe I don't need to be there but I would argue right back
8693800	8698680	mofo but I would say whatever they did to kind of scale back attendance by you
8698680	8703360	know whatever they did from 2006 was a good thing I think the show itself was
8703360	8707680	good I do want to see them reopen Kensha Hall at some point get some more
8707680	8712880	exhibitors out there on the main floor and again the stuff all that stuff is
8712880	8716400	behind closed doors kind of bugs me sometimes but whatever it's just
8716400	8718680	something we're gonna have to deal with I think overall the show itself was
8718680	8723800	better as far as the whole me lamenting about my friends not going and all that
8723800	8727920	stuff I think a lot of that got better I got to go to a pretty bitchin party on
8727920	8732840	Wednesday night that was hosted by games for windows for part of their windows
8732840	8737480	7 kind of preview thing which was actually pretty cool and I got to see a
8737480	8740200	lot of your faces from around the podcasting community and meet a couple
8740200	8744640	new ones that was kind of nice I enjoyed stuff like that the show itself was
8744640	8748160	really different without kind of having the friends there I kind of feel like
8748160	8752760	from a business angle I got more done I didn't collect as much stuff I felt like
8752760	8756560	I actually played more games but in again I also kind of contribute that to
8756560	8761080	the crowd I don't know I you know it's kind of cool the one day Loki was there
8761080	8766720	we got to go around at night at least I had my boyfriend there that I kind of
8766720	8770240	got to see at night so it didn't end up being so bad in that regard I think I
8770240	8773880	would have had even more fun and I would be like more excited and woo and I would
8773880	8776960	have gone all three days keep that in mind is that's a big thing too I didn't
8776960	8780560	go all three days this year oh okay I only went two days and I feel like that
8780560	8784840	was sufficient I got to see everything I wanted to see I was happy with it and I
8784840	8787240	know there's so many people out there that are probably yelling at me right
8787240	8791080	right now like you ungrateful bastard I would give my left nut to go to e3 and
8791080	8794680	you're just talking to your poo-pooing it down but trust me guys it's it is a
8794680	8801780	very exhausting experience it's it's a lot so if you want to go to e3 but you
8801780	8805920	can't just go to PAX because and Bobby's made this comparison before and I think
8805920	8814040	he's absolutely right PAX is probably what you think e3 is so go to PAX I'll
8814040	8818120	be there PAX East Coast PAX that is I want to be at East Coast PAX I'm trying
8818120	8822360	but I gotta make West Coast PAX work too and I'll skip West Coast PAX to come to
8822360	8829680	East Coast PAX come on I can show you all doing both I just heard that they
8829680	8833960	started doing Southwest flights to New York City now did they really yes which
8833960	8838320	women are here to party yeah go to Boston Oh boss well yeah yeah you gotta
8838320	8843640	go to Boston for PAX East well yeah it's close enough for us yeah well stop by
8843640	8848120	four and a half hours Loki you know what another flight connect a jerky when I
8848120	8852080	talk to people on the East Coast you know how many times I'm asked so if I
8852080	8857640	fly into LA I can drive up and visit you in Sacramento right not very easy well
8857640	8860920	I'm just saying you know you can take a cheap flight to New York and then you
8860920	8867440	know fly you connect to you know Boston I guess take a train or train there you
8867440	8871760	know it's not really all that far to Boston besides I want to fly jet blue to
8871760	8875200	New York City I'm sorry if we're given the option between Southwest or jet blue
8875200	8880120	jet blue and I've heard lots of amazing things about Virgin Air that's the
8880120	8883640	airline I want to try at some point yeah a lot of my friends fly Virginia they
8883640	8887280	just love it I've heard great things about it a huge float today too all
8887280	8890080	right hey Rama we got to wrap up and let you go but any quick final thoughts

9113840	9116840	going back to the phones hi you're on orange launch radio who's this it's GS
9116840	9121240	68 hi what's on your mind buddy I came back from the Philippines I wanted to
9121240	9125200	share my arcade side of the things you came back from where I'm sorry the
9125200	9128640	Philippines oh the Philippines that's right I think I saw something on your
9128640	9132120	Facebook about you were going out there oh yeah believe it or not I actually
9132120	9135920	read the status updates on Facebook and Twitter and all that stuff ice how was
9135920	9141800	it it was yes all right though like the our case there was good as last time
9141800	9146200	maybe that's good as I remembered well you know what it's because the arcades
9146200	9150480	over here probably aren't as good as you remember either look that he still have
9150480	9157320	some games that I haven't seen on this side of the Pacific Rim years like life
9157320	9164360	for example Mario Kart arcade GP with card slots but but really surprised me
9164360	9171720	when I was there was house it at that ex hmm how was that basically it's it's just
9171720	9175960	bit of a house of death but like they drew it in a cartoony style and you
9175960	9180200	probably won't believe I'm about to say but basically the storyline of the game
9180200	9184680	it's a zombie romance like that sounds awesome
9184680	9188560	zombie romance movie now that's a movie that we need who wouldn't go see that
9188560	9195840	about this zombie girl who falls in love with her with her prison guard or
9195840	9201480	whatever and they escape and you have to and it's basically a bunch of minigames
9201480	9206120	where you have to do things like catch fruit or shoot the bad teeth off of the
9206120	9210800	stage one fossil positive or better I thought for a minute there you were
9210800	9214240	about to get into lesbian zombie romance because that was the only way this story
9214240	9216200	was gonna get even that much better but that's okay
9216200	9221480	unfortunately no they can do that in the sequel that's all right it's going
9221480	9225880	through perfect and I well as I mentioned it's awesome games that I
9225880	9232080	haven't seen in years like f0ax and oh I love f0ax I gotta ask you real quick
9232080	9234680	though real quick since we have a lot of time tonight what about music games
9234680	9237520	because I know you're big music game fans is there a big presence of games
9237520	9244880	the Philippines hello big is there a big presence of music games over in the
9244880	9254720	Philippines oh I lost I think we are losing gs68 connection I don't know if
9254720	9258880	that's on your end or our end I'm gonna have to let you go I'm sorry I don't
9258880	9262200	know what happened with that connection but we'll hope hope maybe he'll call
9262200	9264600	back later when the connection is a little better in the meantime let me get
9264600	9268160	to another call hi you're on orange launch radio who's this hello hi who's
9268160	9272960	this this is leecham six hello leecham six I don't recognize that name are you
9272960	9277520	a first-time caller yes I am welcome well welcome what a heck of a night hello
9277520	9281440	well what's on your mind buddy yeah yeah I was wondering have you guys I know
9281440	9286040	you guys have addressed iPhone gaming and that sort of thing a little bit but
9286040	9290480	you know what the new 3.0 update they've you can add new devices to it like
9290480	9294760	controllers and stuff mm-hmm have you guys seen that yeah I've seen this one
9294760	9298600	it's like a NES controller but it's like a game bone yeah you know we were
9298600	9301400	hearing about some of this stuff last week I think there was a story that we
9301400	9304280	kind of got into a little bit about like especially about some of the things
9304280	9307600	they're gonna be developing for it but I wasn't under the impression that this
9307600	9311600	crap was already out you can already get this stuff I don't think so there's one
9311600	9314440	in the works though it looks like a SNES controller yeah it's in the works it's
9314440	9317360	called the game bone the only thing that sucks about that is it well they had one
9317360	9320920	I don't know if you can attach it to the game bone or what but they've got like
9320920	9325400	this controller where you can snap it on to the iPhone or iPod touch and then
9325400	9329360	they have another one that like you had to have it in like a sort of stand or
9329360	9332840	something you have to play it with a controller separately and that seemed
9332840	9336640	kind of stupid but the thing about it is they don't really have a standardized
9336640	9340000	controller yet so you buy this controller but you have to wait for
9340000	9345280	people actually support this controller in their games but I have a question so
9345280	9349040	it's a wireless Bluetooth controller right that looks like a NES controller
9349040	9357420	doesn't a lot of people already have one it's called a wiimote do that I guess I
9357420	9360160	just those do run off bluetooth don't they cuz yes put them up to their
9360160	9365240	computers yes so you could in theory use a wiimote or wii classic controller or
9365240	9370520	something like that with that if the you know if that's okay with Apple you know
9370520	9375560	if they can you know support that or trick right or if they don't need to get
9375560	9380080	approved with that if they just support it in yeah whatever game it's coming out
9380080	9385040	I would think anything well well here's my question this other thing you're
9385040	9389080	talking about that whole device the bone or the game game bone is that an Apple
9389080	9393360	official thing or is that now I'm third party come third party interesting so
9393360	9396280	that is interesting that that would come out but you would but see Apple so
9396280	9399680	locked down with that kind of stuff I'm now here I bet it's just a matter of
9399680	9403080	time before someone hacks the phone to read that yeah I'm actually I'm
9403080	9406040	surprised that hasn't happened yet I mean the iPhones been out for two or
9406040	9409040	three years now and we've had Bluetooth the whole time I'm surprised that hasn't
9409040	9413400	happened yet maybe no one sees the point because you know you can't really use a
9413400	9417480	Wiimote on the iPhone with such a tiny little screen but I don't see that's
9417480	9420400	that's that's the point people are missing I don't want to use motion
9420400	9423720	control I just want to use as a nest controller for my nest emulator and that
9423720	9427760	makes sense I I'm kind of surprised that hasn't happened I think it's just
9427760	9430960	because sometimes those iPhones are like Fort Knox to get into I mean not that
9430960	9434880	that's ever gonna stop the hackers right because how many times do they come out
9434880	9440480	and say this is unhackable and then today I never act it just seems kind of
9440480	9444560	pointless of me to have a nest emulator where my fingers cover the screen when I
9444560	9449760	play well now sir you know those the legality of those nest emulators are a
9449760	9452800	little questionable the first place so beggars cannot be choosers my friend
9452800	9455960	well obviously I'm using games that are ripped from my cartridges that I bought
9455960	9461040	when I was seven of course of course yeah you know I'm sure it's a matter of
9461040	9466720	time before the Wiimote thing is hacked but you know I don't know if iPhones
9466720	9471040	really that big of a gaming platform for me iPhone is where I game when I'm
9471040	9474320	sitting in the doctor's office waiting to be called in that it's you know I
9474320	9477680	think I think you addressed that last week actually yeah you're not really a
9477680	9481980	portable gamer yeah but that maybe that's just me so all right well hey
9481980	9484360	thanks so much for the call any other quick things you want to say before we
9484360	9488520	let you go not really just love you guys and congratulations on seven years well
9488520	9491560	thank you very much and you picked a hell of a call in you take care of color
9491560	9496000	sir later guys that was a very nice phone call by the way there was an
9496000	9500600	update on a GS 68 he got cut off unfortunately I wanted to ask him about
9500600	9505880	SV GL Sunnyvale Golf Land and if they actually did have DJ max there and
9505880	9509600	apparently they do have the final version of DJ max is available now at
9509600	9513400	Sunnyvale Golf Land because I'm going to be in the okay I think I would guess in
9513400	9516920	July yeah so I want to check that out and he did play some games in the
9516920	9521200	Philippines that were music oriented as well so let's go to at least one more
9521200	9525080	call here and then we'll show in a moment you think that you think the best
9525080	9529680	last call to end this in the night off with and who am I talking about you
9529680	9535640	hello legend Zaku what's on your pine nothing much just trying to like trying
9535640	9541320	to get through all the grief of what was last week and unfortunately earlier
9541320	9546280	today but I guess we got to move on to bigger better things basically I'm
9546280	9551400	doing this reason I'm calling today is just to bring up the fact that it and
9551400	9556520	Bethesda merged which kind of like you know kind of surprised me because I
9556520	9560680	never thought that you know then John Carmack would actually sell out to
9560680	9564560	something you know to any particular person aside from EA which he's actually
9564560	9570440	working with but not to a company like I don't know like Bethesda the folks from
9570440	9574760	fallout and I'm not or Elder Scrolls I'm not saying that they're all bad and all
9574760	9580880	but I don't know it's kind of like came out of nowhere um yeah I mean yeah we
9580880	9583160	didn't really get into it on the show but I guess that was a pretty big deal
9583160	9587160	about you know ID and Bethesda kind of having their marriage going on there but
9587160	9593600	um I don't know like maybe I'm just not as big of a first-person shooter fan
9593600	9597240	that I've been following ID all this time but I know Bethesda makes some very
9597240	9600800	pretty games so certainly the two of them coming together it's going to be
9600800	9604760	very interesting but you know what when push comes to shove money talks and you
9604760	9607800	may have thought that so-and-so was not going to be selling out but you know
9607800	9611480	when you got bills to pay and you got right he's buying there's always a you
9611480	9615240	know as long as it's still maintain some sort of creative control you know in
9615240	9620440	other words if as long as Bethesda's not like pulling their chain to the point of
9620440	9625680	like choking them out you know creative wise that would probably make sense as
9625680	9629360	long as they mutually respect each other in that level then they could easily be
9629360	9636000	you know and everybody wins Bethesda makes pretty decent games though I mean
9636000	9640080	like obviously you know oblivion is huge fall out to me Elder Scrolls is pretty
9640080	9642760	much with their bread and butter that's what pretty much put them on the map
9642760	9646360	right and look but let's not forget Bethesda not every game they put out has
9646360	9649680	been a huge success the Star Trek game that they did was not you know it's kind
9649680	9654240	of mixed but at least it wasn't terrible you'll mix better than terrible so their
9654240	9659640	track records pretty good overall so you know even though it might be something
9659640	9665240	you didn't imagine before it's not like it's completely unreasonable that ID
9665240	9670600	would go to a fairly respectable company like Bethesda yeah as I said it's all
9670600	9675120	about whether or not John Carmack felt like it was something that he should
9675120	9679640	have agreed with and you know something that I just hope he has confidence in
9679640	9684560	his decision or at least have you know or at least it itself is confident in
9684560	9691680	the decision to merge with with Bethesda but aside from that yeah I can't I can't
9691680	9695440	actually you know end off the call without making a notable mention of
9695440	9700440	Michael Jackson's contribution to video games I mean aside from moonwalker the
9700440	9707160	fact that he contributed to Sonic 3 Space Channel 5 I don't know I guess we
9707160	9712200	never could never really know of how much success this man has because he's
9712200	9718480	pretty much proven himself God knows how many times on all fronts not only on the
9718480	9725680	on the stage or on the recording studio but in our consoles well you know
9725680	9730800	Michael Jackson certainly was involved with Sega he had a lot of love for Sega
9730800	9735200	and I think we would all roll over if they would just put out a moonwalker too
9735200	9741360	but sadly it is just not meant to be well I just hope you know hopefully they
9741360	9744720	could at least port it to Xbox Live Arcade I know whoever owned well but
9744720	9748920	it's gonna be good it's difficult for the fact that God knows who also well
9748920	9753000	I said again I say I based on the same thing I said to the emailer who wanted
9753000	9756800	the thriller album on rock band don't hold your breath because exactly all
9756800	9761040	these rights being up in the air just just don't even the legal mess is only
9761040	9765360	is just a tip of the iceberg and I also want to clarify it's not that Michael
9765360	9770840	Jackson's moonwalker was really that great of a game well the arcade version
9770840	9775400	obviously it was just it was kind of all right it was a frickin video game made
9775400	9778960	out of smooth criminal that's what was cool about it but at least he had at

9783440	9789360	guard dogs dance when he did his magic you can't ignore that that you know even
9789360	9793480	if you hate music which I don't know anyone that says I hate all music you
9793480	9797080	can't ignore the contributions that Michael Jackson made to gaming I would

9823760	9827760	pilot 256 asked Space Channel 5 was a Sega made game on the Dreamcast right
9827760	9833240	uh yeah I think Sega published it I think it was yeah because Mizuguchi at
9833240	9838280	the time worked for Sega so it was a Sega made game yeah yeah I I say I think
9838280	9842800	there's confusion because Mizuguchi now has Q entertainment but he was the
9842800	9845920	mastermind behind Space Channel 5 when he worked for Sega but yeah and then of
9845920	9851280	course space Michael yeah huge well he had a bigger part in Space Channel 5 too

9872560	9875840	thought dark Sagra once starts off tonight your final thought the second
9875840	9880120	density 3 is a freaking epic RPG they really need to give that an official
9880120	9884680	release already just put it on WiiWare for real really my final thought is I
9884680	9889360	really need to finish the Rydia after years because the new episodes come out
9889360	9893040	like in a week yeah just over a week and I'm not ready for him yet I need to
9893040	9898720	finish where I'm at right now so yep Loki your final thought tonight my final
9898720	9906680	thought is that I need to play more fuel yes you do I need to kick your butt at
9906680	9911840	fuel be fun all right all right actually we see we need to go exploring for Vista
9911840	9915160	points although I guess it's not really a cooperative type of game pretty pretty
