15045	21595	28, 2009.
15505	21595	We kick back and celebrate seven years of Orange Lounge Radio with all of our listeners.
31827	36468	Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
36548	40369	We are that video game talk show dedicated, of course, to video games.
40809	43449	Video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.
43469	46670	We like to say it's the place where every gamer has a voice.
46710	52091	But it's going to be these three voices walking you through the next few hours here when we tape live on All Games Radio.
52511	57672	Myself, Rob Roberts, and the one and only Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers, here as well.
58332	58712	Hi.
58932	59252	How are you?
60342	61543	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
85060	85300	Hello.
85500	86100	How you doing, Loki?
86240	86420	Good.
86840	87561	Stay indoors today?
88501	89881	Yeah, I painted baseboards.
90221	90581	Fun.
91381	92862	Being a homeowner rocks, doesn't it?
92962	93522	Yeah.
94502	94882	Awesome.
95142	100403	And then I remember you said something about not being able to get stories for the show tonight.
100523	105864	Yeah, because the internet was down because Comcast was working on improving their network in our neighborhood.
105884	107065	I don't know what that exactly means.
107245	108725	So your house is just broken right now.
110185	110806	Today at least.
110986	111406	That's right.
111946	112967	Well, hey, guys.
113027	116409	It is the seventh year anniversary of Orange Laundry, believe it or not.
116449	119991	We've been talking about it for a couple weeks now, kind of hyping it up a little bit.
120611	122653	And sure enough, we started this little program.
122673	124113	The very first episode was June 23rd.
125274	126035	Thank you for watching!
147239	152386	We can take a minute to say thanks to all of you for helping make it happen.
152426	157714	Because I'll tell you what, that very first show, the very first night, episode number one, we had 12 people listening.
158194	162701	And now on allgames.com, when we tape live, we get as many as 13.
163522	179403	so we've really grown no I'm just kidding obviously we have a little more than that but it's just been great you guys really have taken that to heart what we say at the end of every show to just tell more people about our show and it's worked and we've grown a little bit so thank you guys so much for helping us reach 7 years of Orange Lounge Radio
179844	180725	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
197382	201263	We had three hours to talk all about E3 and what happened there.
201584	203024	Tonight, not so much.
203484	205965	So we're going to just do it the old-fashioned way.
205985	208166	Because this is the way we did the show for many, many years.
208546	210087	So we're going to see if we've still got it in us.
210647	213268	And we're just going to wing it, folks, here on Orange Laundry.
213288	214228	We're just going to wing it tonight.
214784	217985	We've started assigning positions as if Orange Lounge was a starship.
218245	219485	Yes, and what's your position?
219545	219925	Captain.
221085	221865	What's my position?
222005	225066	First officer, because you have to talk to everybody and be my voice.
225206	226226	What would be Loki's position?
226786	227087	Worf.
228767	232868	We've given Loki's security officer position because he's the most aggressive of us all.
233048	233308	I see.
233708	235928	And Jason is our ship's engineer.
236688	238809	We decided that... Big man kind of does that too, though, now.
239629	244430	Jason would be like the engineer, Deakman's kind of the person that would actually... Science officer?
244630	244871	Okay.
245151	246011	He can be our science officer.
246131	246531	Like data?
246691	246911	Data?
247071	247731	Data, yeah.
248371	255113	And then that means that, because I was going to say that Tiara was our science officer, but I'm going to make her... Sulu.
255933	256594	She's our Sulu.
257754	258594	She can be our Sulu.
259294	259834	Oh my.
260235	261475	No, Deakman can be our Uhura.
263584	266386	Because he does so much communication stuff for us.
266706	267866	He's our communications officer.
268387	269908	So Sauce can be our science officer.
270188	270408	Yes.
271188	273189	And then our Sulu is Misty.
273850	274110	Okay.
274590	275391	Because she can drive us.
275571	277312	Now, is there a farting officer?
277372	278952	Because we need Rice Princess to have a role.
279193	280293	Chris is ship's lesbian.
282534	283455	Official ship's lesbian.
283615	283915	Okay.
284155	285736	Wouldn't she be the Troy?
286216	287697	Rice Princess can be our Chekhov.
288238	288438	Okay.
288478	289418	So she can scream at people.
289598	289879	Okay.
289899	290739	Okay.
291520	296021	and do our advanced calculations and stuff.
296141	297301	But we need a ship's counselor.
297422	300502	Now everybody in chat is screaming, you know, who's going to be Quark?
300822	301823	Who's going to be Scotty?
301963	302883	Who's the doctor?
304163	305023	This isn't DS9.
305123	305964	Hello?
306004	306804	We don't have Quark.
306964	308624	We have somebody called the doctor already.
309084	311285	So the doctor would be the doctor, silly.
311305	312945	Ship's doctor will be Shermie.
315126	315366	All right.
315926	316346	Meow, meow.
317046	317286	All right.
317807	319087	She's ship's cat.
319949	325150	Let's do what we used to do here on the show, and instead of talking just about games... Ooh, Patty and Sulu!
325671	327971	Get away from the damn Star Trek for a minute.
329272	331292	There's some folks that don't even like Trek listening to the show.
331312	333153	Well, Game Guru said that Loki's our red shirt.
333453	335633	Hey, if you want to... That's not very nice.
335914	341555	If you want to join the chat room and scream Star Trek obscenities with the rest of our chat, chat.orangeloungeradio.com is the place to be.
341575	342615	Ranma's our ship's counselor.
343056	347937	When we tape live on Sunday nights at All Games Radio at 6 o'clock Pacific Standard Time...
348337	349938	DarkSakura, how was your day, how was your week?
371334	371494	Awe!
392984	393745	with disability pay.
396088	398851	But no, really, I've needed my finger surgery done.
398871	400273	I was supposed to have it done at the end of July.
400293	401234	She's going on the dole.
402876	408883	Well, someone canceled, and so I was able to get it done tomorrow, and that is such a blessing.
409423	410385	Surgery's important, though.
410976	427125	Yeah, it's a 30 minute procedure, I'm going to be awake through the whole thing Oh my gosh But I won't feel, they won't let me watch, bastards So, anyway, as it's going, I've kind of, it sort of really hit me kind of hard this morning So I've been kind of pissy
427905	433910	Try not to be pissy, I've tried to stay in a good mood, but unfortunately when you're pissy, there's not a lot to keep you from just being pissy, you know?
434630	442216	So I'm supposed to go to a birthday party today, because Julie's birthday was Thursday, and yours was Friday, so happy birthday.
442236	442957	Indeed it was, thank you.
443257	444097	I'm sorry I couldn't make it.
444318	445739	That's okay, I didn't have a lot of stuff.
445759	446239	I called you.
446279	452644	Yeah, you did, and we've got plans later this week, and you need to meet the BF and all that fun stuff, so we'll take care of that later this week.
452864	454805	Indian food while I'm high is a kite, that should be funny.
455826	457968	I do not have to learn to play with myself with my other hand.
474744	475905	That's why God made toys.
476105	482069	Those are the kinds of things that DJ Morpheus will throw out there on Saturday nights right here on All Games Radio where he tapes his show now.
482569	486051	I do want to also point out he did say, hope they cut open the right body part.
486771	490674	Because that would kind of suck to go in there and then suddenly you come out of there and you have bigger boobs.
491614	493975	They could cut open the wrong body part and take out part of it.
493995	494516	That would be happy.
495816	496077	Alright.
496857	499779	Anyway, as far as my week?
500399	500599	Yes.
501580	501660	Um...
502918	505502	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
513393	522537	Tell us a little bit about the condition, because I think you haven't talked a lot about playing games yourself on the show in probably the past six months.
522897	527218	Granted, you've had some on the DS and stuff, but I think people don't understand that you have something up with your hand.
527639	530020	You can't really do the controllers for very long.
531740	537883	I'll tell you what hurts most about playing a game is... And by the way, I agree with Travis.
537903	538483	He is our cue.
540111	541912	Thanks for watching!
559560	576481	and those muscles of course are in your forearm and the tendons run from your forearm to your finger and it's my middle two fingers of my right hand my flipping off everybody because they suck finger and my not getting married finger which is the other hand so it's on my right hand
577265	585687	So anyway, the tendons that when they attach to the muscles in your fingers, there's a sheath around them of tissue.
586408	594350	Something that kind of holds them in place so that they don't bow out, you know, like when you have a bow strung too tightly and the things start popping out.
594910	611979	and it keeps the tendons in place and what happened is I have swelling on my hand if you look at your palm up above the center of your palm where the the really fleshy part is right under your fingers I have a knot on each tendon and what happens is that if you imagine like a pulley
613260	613741	DarkSakura.com
630781	632922	Actdeft in our chatroom says, Flexor tendonitis.
632962	633803	It sounds like a DJ.
634563	635083	A little bit.
635523	638905	Well, that's really, I think, the best way I can describe it.
638945	642566	So what they're going to do is actually cut my hand open.
643067	647549	And it's just like they open two little flaps on either side.
648149	652131	And they're going to snip the tendon sheath so that that lump...
652771	652991	DJ Flexer
672916	675317	So they're circumcising your hand?
675537	677618	No, I'm not having skin removed from it.
677738	678998	They're just making a little cut.
680659	691482	But the whole problem as far as how it hurts is that now it's to the point that even when my fingers are straightened out, if I try to bend them, that lump, it's just so much swelling in my fingers.
691502	692943	Because you can actually see it on my palm.
693103	693743	Well, I'm showing Rob.
694843	695324	Great radio.
697425	699927	It's visible on my palm now.
701268	702149	It hurts a lot, actually.
702189	702810	It's really sore.
703810	706793	You know what they say about folks with swelled palms?
707974	708374	They hurt?
708694	709075	Never mind.
710796	711957	Oh, wait, that's hairy palms.
711977	715079	You know what they say about men with big feet?
715980	716440	Big socks?
716560	716901	Big shoes.
717936	726786	Um, but, um, now, holding a controller, now me telling everyone right exactly where the, where the owies are.
727687	734634	Imagine having a piece of hard plastic shoved against swollen tendon tissue for, oh, longer than ten minutes.
735815	737876	Imagine not being able to bend your middle two fingers.
737976	738996	It hurts to hold a fork.
739156	743058	I can't hold, you know, I do graphic art and everything.
743118	750401	I can't hold my stylus or a pen that isn't like a big child-sized fat highlighter or smelly markers for longer than 10 minutes.
751161	752781	And it's really getting in the way of my life.
752862	755483	So I'm just going to say cortisone.
755563	758063	I've had two rounds of cortisone, two shots in each finger.
759224	759524	I'm done.
759844	761945	I'm ready just to have the surgery done and get it over with.
763766	765968	Well, this is like real trauma in the ER type of thing.
765988	767249	Although it's not really an emergency.
767289	767829	It's not bad.
768209	769530	It's not a big procedure.
769630	771512	It sounds a lot like what my mom had a couple years ago.
771532	775174	She had her shoulder operated on and her shoulder was preventing her from painting.
775514	779317	And I know that was really rough on her because she's older.
779397	781379	She's past 65 at this point.
781439	785021	She's long retired from being a preschool teacher and nanny, the stuff she did.
785402	786142	She likes to paint.
786202	787423	That's how she passes the time.
787483	789665	So having to have that surgery was rough for her.
789705	791406	But now she can paint again and she's really happy.
791466	792907	So soon you'll be able to play games again and
792947	793307	DarkSakura.com
812694	813014	Project Natal
836369	837530	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
856680	884044	it was it was just like I would just sit and just sketch you know for stress relief couldn't do it I can't massage people except but with my left hand which fortunately enough my primary clients all of her problems are on her left side so that's fine but you know it's just it's it's gonna be an adjustment but I'm absolutely relieved well now were you able to get into any gaming at all
884580	885501	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
909420	910782	Is that actually a skill in The Sims?
910802	912163	Yes, it's one of the hidden skills.
912423	915447	You can just start playing video games and you can get up to level 10 master video games.
915467	917249	What happens if you max out your video gaming skill?
917289	920292	Do you become like Fatality and you get your own line of video cards and stuff?
920373	921974	No, you just are awesome.
922835	927100	But Simmy is a professional writer and a hacker.
928742	929203	Just because.
930644	931025	All right.
931425	933847	Well... Oh, and I played Peggle.
933987	935328	I'm glad to see Sims is going fun.
935469	935729	Yeah?
936029	936409	I played Peggle.
936429	937050	Peggle on the iPhone?
937390	938151	Yep, on iPhone.
938391	938591	Yeah?
939052	940053	I loves me some Peggle.
940073	941094	I'm glad they did that sale.
941454	942375	That motivated me to buy it.
942955	948981	And for people who are using Linux, there actually is a pretty good version of Breakout on Linux.
950102	952484	I'm running Linux Mint on my laptop.
953184	961690	And I like it that instead of using the arrow buttons to move your little bar around, you actually use the touchpad.
962971	969356	It recognizes the touchpad and you can slide your finger back and forth to move your little bounce bar.
970056	970817	So that was pretty fun.
971657	978662	I played, I was at Boston Market and I was playing Breakout over Chicken at Boston Market.
979683	980724	Nice, Chicken and Breakout.
980984	981204	Yep.
981564	981844	Awesome.
982225	982645	I am done.
982950	983770	Loki, how was your day?
983790	984251	How was your week?
1008268	1013393	I was trying to perfect the perfect modifications to Grand Theft Auto 4.
1013853	1015655	And we have a working set now.
1015755	1017016	It's absolute chaos.
1017417	1022041	I mean, there's explosions going off everywhere consistently.
1023342	1025725	Basically, we replaced a bunch of the weapons in the game.
1026365	1032711	Starting with the Desert Eagle now is a gun that shoots these little vortex...
1034617	1052994	I guess they basically throw people into the air or cars or just whatever you fire it at and um so that was basically the first thing I created which was like a defensive weapon and it works pretty good and then we replaced the um the Mac 11 with uh
1054409	1061374	It's a Molotov launcher that fires lots of fire at people and catches them on fire and cars on fire and you name it.
1061894	1068379	Then the MP5 which is the other Uzi in the game now fires rapid fire grenades and
1069840	1070301	and DarkSakura
1084837	1085958	Real quick question from chat.
1085998	1086498	Let me ask this.
1086678	1089100	Chat.OrangeLoungeRadio.com live on this Sunday evening.
1089500	1092182	Loki, is there any way we can download your mods?
1092222	1093382	That's from SSJ100, Matt.
1093963	1094183	No.
1094403	1096804	I'd have to post a copy of the ISO on there.
1096844	1099326	I guess I could post a copy of my modified files.
1099686	1101727	Then you just have to do the modifications yourself.
1102027	1106790	And then you'd have to build your own ISO and then burn it off and then play it on a modded 360.
1106830	1107230	But...
1110151	1112373	Yeah, I could do that, but it's a lot of work.
1113374	1115056	And then, let's see, what else did I do?
1115176	1120982	Oh, the M4 now fires a bunch of rockets, which is kind of funny.
1121302	1127188	But they don't exactly explode on impact, they just bounce around a lot, which is kind of funny.
1127509	1130992	And then, let's see what else...
1132484	1134186	I think that's pretty much it as far as weapons go.
1134586	1148797	It's just a lot of chaos, and then also the police car flies, and the bus and the big vehicles basically are pretty dense, and they'll crash through anything and go really fast.
1148897	1150479	It's really mixing up the game.
1150939	1159186	Right now, because we've been playing Grand Theft Auto 4 since it's come out, and hell, we've been playing Grand Theft Auto games since they've come out on the PSP, and they had multiplayer in them.
1159746	1160126	So...
1162048	1164671	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1179767	1180408	Thanks for watching!
1207851	1213918	So beyond all that stuff, I've been just kind of unpacking and...
1215788	1216108	I don't know.
1238715	1239015	I don't know.
1239276	1240137	It's all in Japanese.
1259298	1267005	Yeah, I mean, I think with Wii Sports, it's more a lot of people have a curiosity about Wii Sports than are actually looking forward to it, have it pre-ordered.
1267085	1267406	I don't know.
1267726	1272070	I get the feeling our listener base is more curious about it before they're going to plop down that kind of money.
1273512	1274112	It's a good deal.
1274152	1279137	I mean, the game's going to be pretty decent, and it's got 12 sports in it, plus you get Wii Motion Plus.
1279177	1282340	So, I mean, hey, if the game sucks, at least you have Wii Motion Plus.
1283496	1302077	and you know as much I had to buy my Wii Motion Pluses at GameStop just because that's where I ended up turning in my games so I had a lot of credit and it was just games that I've had for a while or gotten free from work like really I'm not going to play UFC or you know I don't really give a crap about the Wheelman so wait so the Wii Motion Plus is already out
1302837	1303858	WeMotionPlus is already out.
1331836	1337000	No, but you can actually play frisbee golf and stuff in Tiger Woods 2010.
1337680	1338461	So that's kind of cool.
1338641	1344365	And then... Yeah, but anyway, so I bought mine at GameStop.
1344425	1350169	And if you aren't using trading credit or happen to be getting free games that are really old and crappy...
1352017	1354758	You're just basically in pay with cash or something like that.
1354838	1357699	Don't go to GameStop because they're charging $5 over retail.
1358119	1360199	They're charging $25 for the Wii Motion Pluses.
1360259	1361240	They retail at $20.
1361940	1362440	They know it.
1362500	1364400	They just figure people are dumb and going to buy it.
1364540	1365841	And yes, I was dumb and bought it.
1366141	1371802	But the only reason I bought it there is because it actually didn't really cost me anything since I traded in games I got for free.
1371862	1373623	So who cares?
1374243	1376964	Really, I could have gone to GameCrazy or something like that.
1378064	1383349	I'm just not going to drive the extra distance to go someplace else other than GameStop, so who cares?
1384170	1386753	But I did buy the last two that they had, so that was kind of cool.
1387593	1392778	And then I'm sure I'll eventually use them, but I just haven't gotten around to it yet.
1393960	1396902	But yeah, that's pretty much what's been going on.
1396942	1402248	I have a lot of games on deck, I guess, to play, and I just haven't really...
1403433	1406275	Red Faction Guerrilla or Arma 2 this week or something.
1423151	1423471	All right.
1424311	1424771	Well, let's see.
1424831	1426952	I'll start with games, then I'll get into personal stuff.
1426972	1427712	Let's see.
1427752	1428532	Games I played this week.
1428572	1429592	I've still been playing Fuel.
1429772	1432173	I think I've played Fuel more than Loki has now.
1432273	1432593	I know.
1432673	1435014	I keep wanting to go back to him.
1435174	1437294	I've unlocked four zones now, which is still nothing.
1437314	1438654	I mean, there's like 19 zones.
1439495	1442715	There's a lot of orange to peel in Fuel.
1443536	1445536	How are the third and fourth zones?
1445836	1447036	What's the third one they unlocked?
1448157	1449937	It's in the middle, the dry run, I think.
1450017	1450518	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1472321	1472881	That's awesome.
1472921	1474262	Yeah, I thought it was actually kind of cool.
1474602	1476302	It really helps in some of the races too.
1476583	1478503	I guess you could say it's cheating, but whatever.
1478703	1479084	Who cares?
1479144	1480004	It's a glitch in the game.
1480044	1480764	It's a silly game.
1481104	1487066	You know, I don't think fuel should be taken extremely seriously, but it's big, dumb, stupid fun.
1488167	1490148	And the world really is huge.
1491588	1494370	I can see, though, some of the reviews I've read say, you know, and I've talked about this game.
1494410	1496551	It's probably going on my third week talking about this game.
1496571	1499433	I don't want to kind of reinvent the wheel here.
1499753	1505976	But I think one of the most common negative things I've read in reviews is that, yeah, you have this big open world, but full of what?
1506316	1507817	There's really not a lot in it.
1508257	1512560	And I think I kind of am getting to understand that point of view a little more.
1512660	1515662	Although I do find this game fun, I think a lot of the courses are pretty cool.
1516762	1522849	There isn't a lot that really, at least in the first few areas Have you gotten to any of the weather things like tornadoes and stuff?
1522869	1538506	Not the tornadoes and stuff, so that's where I'm hoping we'll kind of change my mind I've seen some screenshots of that and that looks crazy I did do a heavy wind type race, but all that did was kind of decrease my visibility and put this weird filter on that just made it look like stuff was blowing in front of my car and everything the whole time It was, I don't know
1539383	1540644	Thanks for watching!
1557899	1561461	So here I am trying to, like, I've unlocked an achievement now for getting 10 Vista points.
1561501	1562962	I think I'm up to, like, 12 Vista points.
1563282	1574809	And for some reason, that's, like, my big goal in this game right now is, like, okay, I gotta play the arcade races until I can get the Doppler truck that I can run into to get the Vista points because I want all the Vista points because that's supposed to be the prettiest areas in the game.
1575129	1575750	I'll tell you what.
1576650	1577010	DarkSakura.com
1600881	1606105	I will tell you the one thing that does drive me nuts.
1606245	1610128	I installed Fueled My Hard Drive and I think it's causing more crashes than ought to be there.
1611489	1618134	Sometimes after I do a challenge, if I do a challenge right out of the camp, the game locks up on me when I try to go back to free run.
1618895	1620095	The loading times are just...
1620956	1621717	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1643032	1647213	If I'm not going to exit that menu, unless I'm going to race.
1647233	1651794	It's loading the actual area of the arc, because when you exit the menu, it doesn't have any load time, I don't think.
1652694	1653434	It just seems weird.
1653734	1654575	The loading times are weird.
1654875	1661456	But honestly, it's not a perfect game, but I am having fun with it, and I think that's what's most important at the bottom line.
1661476	1664357	I can be as critical as I want of a video game on these.
1664817	1667257	I've driven right through a tree.
1667417	1669018	There are some very big...
1669838	1670379	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1689100	1690001	There is some silly fun in it.
1690041	1693744	All those ramp houses have fuel on top of them that you have to stop and get.
1694965	1696287	I usually don't stop for fuel.
1696627	1703934	I'll try to run into it if I'm driving by it, but otherwise... It's funny, when I play on Xbox Live and turn Xbox Live on, there's nobody around anywhere.
1704615	1705276	Just because...
1706302	1708743	I'm surprised they don't have a way to turn that on by default.
1708823	1712444	I think more people would be using it if it was like test drive where it was on by default.
1712845	1713345	You know what I mean?
1714105	1715245	Yeah.
1716126	1716426	Let's see.
1716506	1717806	Other games I've been playing this week.
1718146	1719047	Magic the Gathering.
1719107	1722828	I actually bought Magic the Gathering on Xbox Live despite our little story about it last week.
1723328	1725249	I know DarkSakura is holding up the cards.
1725289	1726149	We still have to have our duel.
1726449	1728690	But you see, I need to remember how to play again.
1729190	1731131	So that's why I downloaded the Xbox Live version.
1731291	1733432	That was the whole point that we were going to play Unpracticed.
1733812	1734353	Oh, my bad.
1734873	1735834	Well, I couldn't resist.
1735874	1736635	I had to check it out.
1737096	1738717	But yeah, I mean...
1739955	1743076	If you like the card game, it's a fairly faithful reinterpretation.
1743536	1743977	I don't know.
1744717	1749539	I still think nothing beats the actual cards for a card game.
1750039	1752640	But I guess they did a pretty good job with the translation.
1752680	1753580	I mean, you know what?
1753760	1755601	Uno, I could make the same argument there.
1756061	1759483	Uno's a card game, but it's still kind of fun on Xbox Live because you have the camera and everything.
1759743	1760423	And I was surprised.
1760603	1762344	Imagine the Gathering has the camera built in too.
1762364	1763104	I didn't realize that.
1763444	1766005	So hooray, a game I can get use out of my Xbox Live camera.
1766025	1766645	I'm excited.
1767546	1767606	Um...
1768366	1772689	But yeah, the game itself, I suck at it, but I was able to at least beat the first guy.
1773229	1774890	And, you know, it's cool.
1775290	1777832	I was having a problem figuring out how to edit my deck, though.
1777852	1779993	It's not very intuitive in that regard.
1780553	1784015	And I'm not looking forward to all the microtransactions that I'm sure to come with this.
1784575	1793601	But, you know what, for what it is, and considering it's only $10, when the card game itself can start to cost you a lot more very quickly, it's worth checking out.
1794201	1794822	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1821443	1822384	Thanks for watching!
1844638	1845400	I didn't play it enough.
1845440	1852517	I need to play it more, but for an early review, I will say I had a lot more fun with it than I was expecting to.
1854082	1855203	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1875698	1881800	and we all like to run around in our G-strings and assless leather chaps wearing nothing but handcuffs.
1882841	1886642	And that is so not true and definitely not me, okay?
1887322	1887962	That's for sure.
1888523	1891924	A, I don't have the body for that, so you can thank yourselves ahead of time for that.
1892324	1897806	And B, it's just not really, you know... Sure, I've done Rocky Horror Picture Show for a long time, but the rest of that...
1898366	1925956	You know, the big stuff they do out there I don't know, it's just not me And I don't like the fact that it's the impression that some people get Because some people are naive So I used to kind of have a problem with it because it was so excessive But let me tell you this In straight culture, there's a lot of excessive stuff as well I mean, think about it Pride is no different from a Playboy mansion party The girls next door MTV's Spring Break Thank you very much How is that any worse than what goes on at Gay Pride?
1927126	1927787	It's really not.
1928167	1931350	MTV Spring Break is just as bad as anything you're going to see in San Francisco.
1933472	1939857	I haven't been to the parade there, but I've been to the Castro Street Fair, which I've heard has almost a similar reputation.
1940498	1941398	And it was really...
1942774	1943595	DarkSakura.com
1960966	1965068	Um, you know what, and then I always hear that argument, what about straight pride?
1965368	1974173	Well, I mean like MTV Spring Break is a little bit of straight pride I think in a way, but also I don't think pride necessarily has to do with just being gay.
1974553	1975674	I think it's about just being different.
1976334	1976854	Out of the Closet
1992080	1995062	and I don't feel the gay shame that I used to.
1995303	2010072	I actually do still agree though with Patton Oswalt is that the gay pride parade should actually tour from state to state and go everywhere instead of just the cities where you're not really shocked by it existing like Tuscaloosa.
2011264	2011484	Nice.
2012425	2018787	So yeah, I did that today and that was cool, except for having to stand out in the blaring sun for like two hours, less cool.
2019488	2020468	But you're in San Francisco?
2020908	2021629	It still was hot.
2021749	2024930	I mean, even though it's San Francisco right by the ocean, you have a nice breeze, it was still hot.
2025470	2029512	What was kind of cool, speaking of hot, Gavin Newsom walked right by us.
2029712	2031013	So we got to like, he was like right there.
2031093	2033934	And Victoria, who hasn't been on the show in a long time.
2034474	2040456	Gavin Newsom, he's the mayor of San Francisco, and he's going to be running for governor in 2010.
2041176	2044397	He walked right by, and Victoria exclaimed, oh my god, he's even hotter in person.
2044457	2045937	I was thinking of someone else for some reason.
2047218	2048878	No, he's very controversial.
2049298	2056220	But anyway, I'm not going to get into politics too much in there, but it was just kind of cool to see someone that a lot of people know right there.
2057841	2062122	Let's see, the rest of my week outside of today, I'm going to be honest, I've had a very...
2063385	2064367	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2078667	2079808	and I had it in my car.
2080089	2081170	Shocking, right?
2081230	2082712	But I don't know what happened.
2082752	2090561	I think just everybody was just kind of into just talking and, you know, the TV just hardly ever got turned on but for music on the cable music channels.
2090941	2093865	So it was just kind of like, you know, just kind of a different type of party which was cool.
2094986	2095346	Let's see.
2095627	2098850	And as far as the rest of my week, okay, look, like...
2099791	2106297	What a crazy week it's been, especially if you're a Hollywood celebrity right now, right?
2106878	2117608	And you might be wondering, I wonder if OLR is going to be doing a tribute tonight to Michael Jackson, or Farrah Fawcett, or Ed McMahon, or that infomercial guy, what was his name?
2118349	2119390	Was that the ShamWow guy?
2119550	2120030	Billy Mays.
2120171	2121171	Billy Mays, okay, I don't...
2121892	2123113	Obviously, I don't follow this stuff.
2123213	2124654	I don't stay up late enough.
2125975	2127056	But okay, so he passed away.
2127076	2137004	But see, I've had a lot more weighing on my mind this week because somebody I actually know who I don't... And one of the first questions I got asked about this was, has she been on the show before?
2137184	2140046	I don't believe she has, even in the many years of this show.
2140066	2140727	I think a lot of people...
2141587	2160579	are on the show know of her her name was Beth and she passed away on Tuesday which sadly was also the anniversary of the show and she passed away from swine flu or H1N1 virus she'd been in the hospital for 11 days and unfortunately succumbed to complications of swine flu basically her
2161259	2165282	I don't want to get into gory detail, but her kidneys failed, her lungs failed.
2165383	2168125	She was brain dead, and that was the end of it.
2168265	2170647	So they had to do what they did there.
2171247	2174930	And it was just kind of the whole thing's kind of weird.
2175330	2176591	I don't really know how else to explain it.
2176811	2177192	Surreal?
2177612	2178713	It's very surreal.
2178853	2179914	I haven't really...
2180394	2189705	You know, I'm not going to proclaim that I was Beth's BFF in the world, but I really respected this woman, and I saw what a motherly figure she was to all her gays, and just people in general.
2189745	2194431	Not just the gays, but people in general, and just what an accepting, fun person she was.
2194511	2196313	She was always the type that lit up a room.
2196653	2199596	One thing I will never forget about Beth is she was the first person to tell me
2200680	2201100	www.DarkSakura.com
2218331	2220333	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
2236889	2237389	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2258308	2284041	I don't I'm treating this like a four-year-old deals with death I'm like literally thinking in my mind we're gonna go have a party we're gonna go hang with Beth they're throwing a fat party at Beth's house it's gonna rock but like the there's a part of me that still doesn't get that she's like not here you know and I because I think it's something that nobody understands like H1N1 that I'm not able to wrap my head around it this week so I apologize if I'm not
2285419	2286420	I don't think anyone blames you.
2307031	2317770	but I understand I'm coming to terms with why the media shoves this down our throat for the same reason why Beth was splashed over every local news station here in Sacramento is that
2320866	2322587	I don't want to get too deep here on a video game talk show.
2322607	2324647	I'm sorry, but this has been a lot that's been on my mind this week.
2324787	2325787	Seven years, we do what we want, right?
2327548	2330149	Death is something that we don't understand.
2330989	2335470	We have a lot of reasons and things that we try to come up with to explain it.
2335510	2336650	That's religion, right?
2337691	2340451	But at the end of the day, we don't really understand death.
2341532	2342552	So when it happens...
2344292	2348474	We do what we can to try and, I guess, understand it.
2349414	2349694	I don't know.
2349714	2350775	Is there something you wanted to point out?
2350935	2359859	I actually wrote a blog post about it after because the day that you posted about Beth, one of my good friends at work, we found out he died.
2360059	2360499	That's right.
2361019	2378960	and I found out that he had been a little sick but was just going to go see the doctor because he was experiencing heartburn but of course heartburn also was one of the first signs of a heart attack and he didn't come in on Monday and I actually was looking for him on Monday we had been talking about Linux and I was going to show him my laptop and
2381671	2382132	We didn't see him.
2382172	2382752	We didn't hear from him.
2382792	2384353	He's always super good about calling in.
2384473	2385814	He's like the man there.
2385874	2388096	He knows so much about everything, you know.
2388856	2390677	And just completely fun to be around.
2390818	2395661	And then Tuesday, one of the people in his department called his sister.
2396361	2400264	And so she sent her husband to go check on... His name's Pete.
2400925	2404647	Went to go check on over at Pete's apartment and found him dead.
2405568	2405668	So...
2407706	2436774	and I freaked out and then of course that same afternoon is when I went in to have my consultation so but it's like I came home it was I think I actually wrote up my my post on my blog and I'll link it in the chat if anyone wants to see it just about getting it all out because it's like you were saying and my own belief is that and this is again this me I'm sorry for getting philosophical is it just happens I don't think anyone's singled out I don't think that there's any sort of cosmic vendetta that I don't I don't really believe in karma
2437174	2442820	I want to make this very clear because a lot of people even locally and reading comments on news stations and stuff misunderstand this.
2442860	2444021	I want to make some things clear.
2444382	2445683	Beth did not go to Mexico.
2446103	2448426	Beth went to Las Vegas, but Beth did not go to Mexico.
2449046	2449286	Beth...
2450605	2452266	None of Beth's friends have this disease.
2452987	2455528	Those that live with her, those that know her, have been tested for it.
2456189	2457890	This is an isolated incident.
2458090	2459371	She was healthy.
2460111	2462153	Yes, she was a little overweight, but you know what?
2462173	2463594	So were most of Americans.
2464214	2466375	Welcome to the USA.
2466656	2470278	She was a healthy, fun-loving, happy individual.
2471659	2472900	This has not been explained.
2473420	2474681	This may not be explained.
2475421	2475822	That's the...
2476642	2477423	Weird thing about it.
2477843	2478623	It happened.
2478903	2494332	Honestly, that's really in my belief system is that disasters, whether they be something like this, whether they be a hurricane, whether they be a flood, it's not... I don't think that it's any... God's punishing people.
2495033	2496374	I don't believe that God punishes people.
2496414	2499295	I think God's got way too many other things to do to deal with our petty little problems.
2499876	2500196	Honestly.
2501483	2508350	And so, I don't believe that there's a great cosmic hand in the disasters or the good things that happen in life.
2508390	2511833	I think they just happen because they're set in motion to happen.
2512534	2516798	They're not predestined, just, it's, this is how it happens.
2516918	2523064	You know, she may not have had a good immune system as far as that goes because, you know, some people, like...
2524125	2532289	I've known people who have been almost hospitalized from just plain old illnesses.
2532430	2536252	I had pneumonia for three months and almost went in the hospital.
2537412	2541794	I just really think it just happens, and the best way to deal with it is just accept that it happens.
2542995	2543735	Remember the good parts.
2573086	2576487	That was a huge thing in television at the time.
2576928	2580709	Because that actor who had played Mr. Hooper died and they had to explain that to the children.
2581009	2588372	Because I don't know how they do Sesame Street now, but back then they kind of taped it, like, not live, but, you know, it was kind of, you know, it was only a couple weeks behind.
2588393	2589173	A little off the cuff, too.
2589193	2589713	You know what I mean?
2589753	2591094	Like, it was kind of unfolding.
2591214	2592134	So they had to explain it.
2592474	2593795	And the way they explained it...
2594375	2596637	and Big Bird was so upset about it.
2596697	2597658	Go watch this on YouTube.
2597938	2601040	You want to see one of the greatest television... I'm not... I am not fucking with you.
2601080	2603362	This is one of the greatest television moments ever.
2603903	2605624	Go look up... I watch this live.
2606024	2609307	Go watch Big Bird and Mr. Hooper's death.
2609347	2609607	I don't know.
2610368	2611589	YouTube Mr. Hooper death.
2611609	2612349	You'll find it somewhere.
2612990	2616492	And watch how they explain it because the way they explain it to Big Bird is that he's...
2617353	2627827	he's wailing, he's bawling he's crying, he's talking about I miss him, I don't understand why he's not coming back and finally the only answer that he'll accept this is just something that happens yeah
2628317	2656886	so anyway I don't mean to get too off the subject but with the whole you know tributes to Michael Jackson and all this stuff especially you know and all this stuff in the media and so forth you know I don't really want to join in but at the same time I understand I mean don't get me wrong the man made great contributions to popular culture say what you will about his personal life whatever his personal life ain't none of my business you know well unless he broke well whatever I'm not going to get into that he is who he is yeah let's leave it at that but
2657865	2668419	I think the reason why everybody's talking about it and the reason why it's in the media and all this other stuff is that this topic kind of brings people closer together.
2668839	2671242	It kind of helps people try and understand
2672740	2673801	What cannot be explained.
2674361	2677024	I mean, who hasn't heard a Michael Jackson song?
2677985	2680968	Everybody has heard a fucking Michael Jackson song at some point in their life.
2680988	2681689	Unless they're deaf.
2683531	2684652	You know what I mean.
2684752	2686374	Even then, you've probably seen him dance.
2687515	2692460	You have somehow been influenced by this guy one way or the other.
2692781	2694603	So when somebody like that passes away...
2695834	2698496	There's definitely, everybody's going to feel that type of connection.
2698536	2700657	Like, oh, I remember that song.
2701018	2703019	Or, oh, I remember watching it on TV.
2703079	2705541	And like, I'm not going to get to see that again.
2705741	2707002	Although, that's not really the case.
2707082	2711565	Because the nice thing about being an artist is the contributions you make live on forever.
2712045	2720190	It feels like something that, and I'm not going to say, because honestly, once I got older, I didn't really care for his stuff too much anymore.
2720231	2721832	But I had a Michael Jackson doll when I was little.
2722532	2723112	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2742922	2745783	Oh, you know, it's that sort of, huh, feeling.
2746543	2751264	But like, okay, but with the infomercial guy that died today, like, I'm not understanding that one.
2752424	2755384	I mean, do people really truly miss him?
2755424	2759225	There aren't his friends and family, which I'm very sorry to hear about their loss.
2759285	2760505	It sounds like it was a sudden thing.
2760885	2763706	But for the, like, it's a trending topic on Twitter, okay?
2764226	2764866	Like, really?
2765366	2767466	I think that... Was he really that influential?
2767506	2768687	Like, maybe I'm missing something.
2768927	2770547	And I'm sorry, I don't mean to offend, but...
2771147	2774111	Keep in mind, he spawned a lot of funny.
2774672	2777616	He was one of those things, oh, ha, ha, ha, you know, that you sort of just mention about.
2777636	2779138	So it's like a 4chan funeral or something?
2779979	2781140	I would expect so.
2781240	2783584	I think it's just more like, oh, that guy?
2784565	2788290	You know, because you don't have him to kick around anymore.
2788806	2789026	Yeah.
2789106	2789407	You know?
2789767	2790047	I know.
2790668	2794370	I was actually, though, for all the celebrity deaths, I was the saddest about Farrah Fawcett.
2795251	2796512	Not because of her fantastic hair.
2797733	2799975	And I think it's horrible, though, to die of anal cancer.
2800575	2803538	That's just a horrible thing.
2803598	2807361	If I try to watch her NBC special, I get incredibly, I can't watch it.
2807461	2809663	Like, I get so choked up, I feel like I'm gonna barf.
2809723	2811064	But you know what I think the worst thing was?
2811124	2812425	Is that she was gonna marry, what's his name?
2812705	2812945	I know.
2813405	2813905	Anyway, I'm sorry.
2814125	2819867	We are like taking this video game talk show and really just getting way too deep tonight on our 7th anniversary which is supposed to be so important.
2819907	2821207	It's our fucking show!
2823728	2824428	Guess what?
2825049	2826289	There's no Santa Claus either.
2827749	2830010	And the Easter Bunny was made up by Pagans.
2833330	2844813	Bobby Blackwolf, our old buddy here, one thing to realize is that he was also on a reality show on Discovery about Pitchman, and a lot of people watched that because it showed more about the way he was outside of screaming, here's how to order.
2845573	2848894	So that's why I think more people got hit by Billy Mays than you would expect.
2848994	2852034	I watch Pitchman, and yeah, all he does is scream on the show.
2852594	2853515	No, really he doesn't.
2853635	2855135	It kind of makes me sad.
2855575	2859716	It's weird, out of, no offense to Beth or anything, but out of all the celebrity deaths,
2860578	2862479	Actually, the Billy Mays one was the most surprising.
2862499	2864360	I mean, it's like, holy crap.
2864560	2865481	I'm like, what the hell?
2866361	2873045	There's somebody that's in perfectly good health, but apparently the circumstances revolved around it.
2873085	2886913	Apparently he was on a plane that landed really, I don't know, had a bad landing, I guess, and it caused part of the ceiling or whatever to hit him in the head and maybe did some brain damage that way and he died in his sleep.
2886993	2887293	What?
2887774	2887954	Yeah.
2889454	2890694	It was an American Airlines flight.
2891095	2893736	So that's what's going on there.
2894676	2896137	He died a few days later, I guess.
2897037	2899538	That so doesn't sound real.
2899838	2904800	We would be hearing so much more about an impending lawsuit and all this stuff.
2904880	2906640	I think there will be an impending lawsuit.
2907341	2909742	It sounds like it, but the Pitch Minute show is kind of fun.
2911342	2912523	I like watching that.
2912543	2914183	Again, I don't mean any disrespect.
2914283	2916024	It's just been such a weird week.
2916744	2918205	We've been celebrating death...
2919181	2920822	I shouldn't say celebrating, but you know what I mean.
2920862	2922403	Memorializing, trying to understand.
2922423	2923344	I use that word.
2923364	2924664	It's like, who will be tomorrow?
2924725	2926566	I mean, which celebrity's going to die tomorrow?
2926586	2927726	And life in the same week.
2927786	2928907	My birthday was this week.
2929367	2931909	31 years of life that I should be lucky to have because Beth only got 24.
2932009	2933470	And, you know, I...
2935382	2935963	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2964224	2965065	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2993010	2996472	Walk in the men's room, use the restroom, then walk right out without washing your hands.
2996532	2997692	That shit needs to stop.
2999093	3001094	We need to have a little more sanitary.
3001334	3005577	We might not be able to stop disease completely, but we can sure slow it down.
3005597	3011620	And if anything, this just goes to further emphasize the point that Vegas is dirty.
3011800	3013581	Very dirty.
3013621	3014141	Very dirty.
3015509	3017049	Yeah, well, you know, I don't know.
3017589	3018110	We're not going to know.
3018450	3025771	But here's the thing is that wash your hands, you know, after the bathroom in general, after eating and all that stuff.
3025851	3027112	Keep hand sanitizer with you.
3028172	3030352	You don't have to be crazy germ obsessive.
3030472	3034093	I don't think we need to start a frenzy, and I think that's sometimes what the media does.
3034453	3036914	But just be careful.
3037614	3038014	That's it.
3038874	3040014	Be careful and don't be lazy.
3041015	3041555	So there you go.
3042195	3042475	All right.
3043661	3047064	Anyhow, that's, I guess, that for the deep topics.
3047124	3048985	Let's get back into video games for a minute, can we?
3049705	3051667	I know, Loki, you've been awfully quiet this whole time.
3051687	3053748	Surely you've got some game stories to take us away.
3054909	3058352	I just want to say, though, again, we don't have a script tonight, so we're just going to kind of wing it tonight with the game stories.
3058392	3059032	We'll talk about things.
3059292	3061694	We'll open up the Skype line a little bit if you guys want to call in as well.
3062475	3067218	And also, housekeeping, if you want to add us on Facebook, that would be wonderful.
3067438	3068079	Orange Launch Radio.

3095163	3095963	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
3115407	3117008	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3133103	3134324	They're testing it right now.
3134364	3143329	They're installing some kiosks into a few of their stores that are going to do used game trade-ins and also used movie trade-ins.
3143710	3154336	So you can actually trade in your games at these kiosks and then you basically get credit for whatever's in there and they give you the credit on a Best Buy card.
3154956	3156758	And you get to go spend that credit in the store.
3157731	3159296	Which I think is kind of a neat idea.
3159757	3161261	And hey, I'm all about getting...
3164662	3166543	You know, alternatives to, like, GameStop.
3166743	3178166	And you know the thing that's kind of pissed me off about GameStop lately is when you do trades, before they used to go, okay, you know, they'll scan a game, okay, that was $18, okay, here's, this is $24, and stuff like that.
3178266	3183648	Now it's just like, they have all your trades, they've already put them behind the counter, okay, you get this much store credit.
3184208	3187629	It's like, well, you know, what if that was not satisfactory to me?
3187669	3191791	What if, you know, they don't say, oh yeah, by the way, that one game was only worth 50 cents, you know, that...
3192871	3193732	I don't like how they do that.
3193752	3194693	It's kind of shady.
3194733	3197755	Every place else tells you what you're getting for each game that you trade in.
3197795	3200157	Is that just maybe the particular GameStop you're going to?
3200297	3202739	No, they've all been doing it now, so I don't know.
3203079	3207162	Maybe it's just they don't care or whatever, but they used to do that.
3207643	3212607	Now, what's kind of cool about this is when you scan it, basically it works like this.
3212667	3216970	You go to the kiosk, you scan the barcodes of the games that you have.
3219241	3223583	on the machine, and it will tell you how much it's going to give you for those games.
3224043	3227325	And you say, okay, whether to accept or deny that offer.
3227365	3244874	So if you accept it, then what you'll do is you'll pop the disc out, you'll drop the case into almost like a drop box that they have there, like a mailbox, and then the discs themselves get inserted into the machine, and it will scan them to make sure that they're readable or don't have scratches on them, or to verify that
3245374	3249117	I guess if it's an authentic game or whatever.
3249497	3249817	I don't know.
3249837	3255601	The whole process, to me, doesn't seem like it would work because the read...
3256843	3261066	An Xbox 360 disc versus reading a Wii disc is completely different.
3261266	3264828	And, I mean, have you ever tried reading a Wii disc on your PC?
3265129	3265749	It doesn't work.
3265989	3267310	It's because they read them differently.
3267530	3268671	They have a different file format.
3269071	3274035	So, if it's actually physically scanning the surface of the disc, make sure there's no scratches, I guess.
3274415	3275496	Maybe that's how it's working.
3275896	3279558	There is another one, I think, that they scanned, like, a little barcode that's in the middle of the disc.
3280119	3281460	I'm not sure if that's how it's working.
3281600	3284321	But, either way, you know, to kind of get around the whole...
3285865	3286545	DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com
3309890	3311771	and you type in whatever billing information.
3311811	3315674	If I wanted to make myself look like Bob Barker or something like that, I could do that.
3316215	3318096	There's really no way for the system to know.
3320157	3321518	Here's what I don't understand.
3321778	3324160	Why this whole elaborate kiosk thing?
3324640	3331305	If this is the business Best Buy wants to get into, it's not like the stores are always that freaking crowded and full of people.
3331345	3335608	Why can't the service associates just scan the games and check them out the old-fashioned way?
3335929	3336530	I don't know.
3336590	3344849	Well, maybe it's because they're trying to get into more of a GameStop type of business model, but at the same time, they don't want to really...
3346809	3347850	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3366807	3394695	and the same thing for these I have a feeling these are just branded E-Play machines because E-Play is also working with I want to say Walmart as well they're going to be doing the same type of thing game trading and I bet you anything they can brand their machines to look like any sort of stuff Walmart's machines are just going to say Walmart it's not going to say E-Play but I bet you these are the same machines because it sounds like the exact same thing that they're doing with Walmart
3395606	3396467	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3420942	3422443	But you know, you don't get that much for them.
3422463	3427669	I think the game I got more for than any other was Mario Party, but that's because they'd stopped making it and it was still in demand.
3427969	3430972	There's a few games that will become in high demand and stuff like that.
3431493	3437640	What I normally do, because I get some promo copies every now and then, but it's for stuff that I don't plan on playing or...
3438200	3440261	You know, I may have already picked up or whatnot.
3440381	3444682	I try to trade it in as soon as I get it because that's usually what's worth the most.
3444942	3450424	And yeah, I know I can make a lot more money selling it on eBay, but to be honest, I just don't want to go through the hassle.
3451104	3463088	And for me, it doesn't really make a difference because I'm not really losing out any money when you think about it because I'm paying nothing to get the game and any money I make from it is more money than I would have had anyways.
3463668	3463928	So...
3465327	3486078	I don't know, and a lot of times, you know, store credit and stuff sits on my card forever, you know, for a very long time before I actually use it for stuff, because honestly, you know, with the situation that I have, my Wii's modded, my Xbox 360's modded, the PS3's the only thing that's not really modded, my PSP's modded, my DS is modded, I don't really have to buy games if I don't want to, I mean, that's the thing.
3487088	3492131	I don't have to buy games because I can get them through other means if I really want to play them.
3492471	3498654	But honestly, I have less time to play games now and I'm really not going to have time soon enough.
3498674	3499815	It's those baby games.
3499895	3504177	Yes, exactly.
3504217	3509620	Maybe that's not a great way to look at it because I'm sure a lot of developers work hard on putting out the games.
3509660	3510201	But you know what?
3510241	3510701	It's one game.
3510721	3511481	I just don't care anymore.
3516909	3520318	And I know that's probably a bad stance on that, but...
3520743	3521404	I don't care.
3521464	3524646	I do find it interesting everybody is trying to get into this business.
3524706	3534432	It's going to be interesting to see if GameStop has to do something too and other game stores have to do something to reinvigorate their business without this competition.
3534532	3539015	I could see them maybe putting an actual kiosk out in front of their store or something like that.
3539396	3543598	Hey, look, now you can trade games while we're closed.
3544019	3549883	Or the other thing these machines are actually going to do is allow you to rent games as well.
3550583	3552704	Which, you know, they're testing that.
3552744	3553924	And I think that's a great idea.
3554444	3561547	You know, because, A, renting games, you know, especially when you can stick these kiosks, you know, like, say, in an apartment complex or something like that.
3561887	3562587	That's kind of cool.
3562767	3566608	And you can also trade movies into this, which is also pretty cool because, you know what?
3566708	3568489	GameStop doesn't take movies back anymore.
3568609	3570710	They've stopped selling movies because it didn't work for them.
3571250	3572130	So that's something else.
3572390	3578352	And what's also great about this, too, say if you have games and stuff you want to trade in, now you don't have to necessarily buy a game with it.
3578392	3579513	You can buy, you know...
3580273	3584016	Blank CD artists or an iPod or a TV.
3584036	3592902	That's one thing I do like about it is that I could see myself using this money more effectively at Best Buy just because there's more to pick from than there is at GameStop.
3593083	3603550	Or, and the other thing too, you need a gift card for Best Buy and then you go up front where they have their gift card kiosks with all these different gift cards for, say, Red Lobster or something like that.
3603831	3606573	You trade in some DVDs or whatever and now you have dinner.
3607461	3610463	So it, I don't know, there is benefits to it.
3610583	3611704	And same thing with Walmart.
3611724	3615006	Walmart's going to be doing the same type of thing where you get in-store credit.
3615667	3618469	And hey, you know, some of these super Walmarts, there's your groceries.
3618609	3620610	So I don't see it as a bad thing.
3620730	3627135	And you know what, if anything, I do like the fact that, you know, you do have that choice where you can buy stuff other than games.
3627155	3629136	Because you know what, sometimes I just don't want to buy games.
3629577	3629737	Right.
3630410	3631211	I turned off my torrents.
3631231	3631831	So I don't know, so just...
3652130	3653631	I don't know, it could just be a fluke.
3654372	3658694	But there's nothing we can do here in studio, so we'll just keep doing our thing, do the show best we can.
3659074	3661176	But as far as we know, it is not on our end.
3661596	3665278	All right, so let's, I guess, move on with some more news, if we can.
3665538	3669401	DarkSakura, I know you had some things you wanted to talk about tonight, so let's make sure we get that taken care of.
3669421	3669681	Yes, I did.
3669981	3672182	Well, this is just a bit of interest.
3672602	3676665	I know that there's people who are fans of the Serious Sam series,
3677265	3700492	so there's actually a PC version of Serious Sam HD that came out for Xbox Live Arcade it will be released digitally and also in shops and the console version however is not going to be out this summer so it's going to be there when it's there so that's pretty good
3701676	3702897	Serious Sam is serious.
3702997	3722997	No, I don't know, it looks kind of cool, kind of like an old school Duke Nukem type of game, and, you know, that they're actually doing something to it other than just, let's put it back out, you know, or, hey, well, Duke Nukem, I guess, Duke Nukem 3D did, like, that rewind thing, which was neat, and then I stopped playing the game, you know, that's the problem, but, uh, I don't know.
3723479	3726180	They need a new Duke Nukem game for Xbox Live.
3726200	3727381	That'd be cool.
3727481	3729401	Rumor is there might be another one in development.
3729782	3731102	Was Duke Zero or something?
3731382	3733443	Did you read that this week?
3733523	3734403	Yes, I did.
3735464	3739285	My first thought was, stop ripping off subtitles for Batman.
3740466	3744547	Seriously, it was Duke Nukem Forever and then Duke Begins.
3744627	3745448	I'm like, stop.
3745568	3746588	And then Duke and Robin.
3746788	3747168	Who knew?
3747809	3748389	Exactly.
3750580	3752602	Speaking of Xbox Live, can I say this real quick?
3752622	3754423	I'm sorry, DarkSakura, but you would appreciate this.
3754743	3758366	Have you ever played Garou, Mark of the Wolves, the game that came out on Xbox Live this week?
3758487	3760028	I know you may not have played it on Xbox Live.
3760288	3761369	Have you played it in the past?
3762030	3765232	Yeah, I think I have the PS2 version.
3766193	3767134	No, I have the Dreamcast one.
3767494	3771197	But you realize that some of the characters in this game have some really funny names, right?
3771457	3771818	Like who?
3772138	3776922	Well, okay, there's some characters, like Kim Capuan apparently had kids, and one of them is named Dong.
3777542	3779863	That's one of the characters that you can play in the game.
3780103	3784904	But then there's another character in the game, and the name of the character is... I'm looking for it here.
3785824	3788865	Kushunud Butt is the name, and that's B-U-T-T.
3789345	3793606	So you can literally play in this game Butt vs. Dong.
3795187	3797007	Or Dong vs. Butt, if you will.
3797408	3805870	And I know this is so junior high for me to say, but what kind of surprised me about this whole thing, the Butt vs. Dong, is that we still have...
3806994	3810757	This whole controversy going on about what can and can't be in your profiles.
3811918	3824169	I almost want to put in my profile Butt vs. Dong just to see if I get, you know, a temp ban or something and say, what, I was just referencing an epic Mark of the Wolves fight I had online.
3824990	3825270	Lord.
3827392	3827932	Just saying.
3828393	3829674	If you don't believe me, Go look.
3833732	3835994	I am not making this crap up.
3836054	3836354	I know.
3837315	3838656	I have the game on Dreamcast.
3838676	3839957	I saw it in Rob D's live journal.
3840158	3841278	He had a screenshot of it.
3841339	3842660	I'll give credit where credit is due.
3842700	3843761	And I just started laughing.
3843801	3844541	And I didn't believe it.
3844561	3845822	I thought it was a Photoshop thing.
3846163	3847724	Like he was trying to make a joke I didn't get.
3848044	3849706	So I looked it up on Wikipedia, like the characters.
3849726	3853629	Because as much as I love Fatal Fury, I kind of fell out of it before this game ever came out.
3854430	3856111	And I went and looked it up on Wikipedia.
3856151	3858453	And sure enough, there's a character named Butt and a character named Dong.
3858473	3859813	You need to come over.
3860874	3861874	Well, you know what?
3861934	3866896	After your dinner, let's hook up the Dreamcast and get our guru on.
3867656	3869637	My boyfriend will be so bored if he's here.
3870217	3870577	Really?
3871257	3872258	He's not much of a gamer.
3872318	3872718	We'll see.
3873378	3874639	Why don't we watch a movie?
3874959	3876159	Yeah, a movie he can do.
3876179	3877239	Why don't we watch movies?
3877460	3877960	Yeah, we'll do that.
3877980	3879020	We'll make him watch that.
3879080	3879860	On your sexy Blu-ray.
3880000	3881761	God, my TV is sexy.
3882461	3882601	Yeah.
3882821	3883242	It'll be fun.
3883442	3884242	Sorry, more gaming news.
3884727	3886848	Well, I actually do have one other little thing.
3886948	3887128	Sure.
3889069	3891611	You know how we all like to make fun of video game movies?
3891651	3893051	You know, I just was talking about Silent Hill.
3893251	3894792	I love that movie.
3895092	3896313	They're doing an Uncharted movie.
3897774	3902156	It's actually being scripted by Kyle Ward, who already did Kane and Lynch.
3903497	3906278	Bruce Willis is starring in that prequel.
3907078	3910580	I like Bruce Willis, because he's aged better than Harrison Ford.
3911521	3912581	Except for Hudson Hawk.
3912661	3913462	That, no.
3914924	3915545	Moving forward.
3917767	3932339	But it's also being produced by some former Marvel people, Avi and Ari Arad, who are also producing The Lost Planet.
3934541	3937824	They were actually going to adapt Lost Planet to a film.
3939045	3941788	So, hey, that might be neat.
3943382	3944483	If they do it right.
3945924	3951547	The whole thing with this video game to movie adaptation is just it has to be done right.
3952548	3952808	You know.
3954089	3955170	We can't have, you know.
3957971	3961674	We can't have another repeat of Super Mario Bros.
3962791	3963291	Oh lord.
3963911	3965172	That's a movie I've never watched.
3965232	3967253	I just kind of refuse to watch a Mario Brothers movie.
3967473	3969414	I've seen a few minutes of it.
3969554	3971174	I've seen like a few minutes of the end.
3971735	3973916	I've heard of those funny scenes.
3974076	3975316	I thought that movie was alright.
3975836	3977337	I remember seeing it in theaters.
3978646	3979346	And you know what?
3979586	3980106	So what?
3980427	3981907	So what if the Super Mario Bros.
3981967	3983167	movie was crap?
3983608	3987509	What the hell are you going to do plot-wise with Super Mario Bros.
3987529	3987929	the movie?
3988009	3989049	I mean, seriously.
3989450	3993491	There's nothing that they could have possibly done that would have made any sense.
3993591	3995912	Hell, the cartoon didn't make any sense at all.
3996752	4002574	And, you know, props for them trying to come up with an original idea, to be honest, though.
4002634	4002834	It was...
4004278	4005439	What is up with your icons?
4019953	4020234	You know what?
4020254	4023577	The default icons on our site come from some... Oh, that's a default?
4023677	4024818	Oh, that's a WordPress one.
4025199	4027481	It's a user-generated site.
4027881	4029903	I'm never getting rid of my Deadpool.
4030284	4032866	Anyhow, was that it for your stories today?
4032886	4032966	Yeah.
4033307	4036069	Well, not for my stories, but that's all I'm going to talk about for now.
4036089	4036350	For now.
4036510	4037991	Well, then we'll come back to you later on in Part B.
4039312	4039972	Why don't we?
4040213	4043414	Alright, because we're going to take a break soon, but I want to get a few more stories out.
4043474	4045094	I know Loki's got a bunch he wants to get through.
4045114	4048155	I'll let him get one more, but let me just give you a couple quick ones here.
4049016	4053897	Of course, we were talking a lot about the celebrity deaths all are crazy around Hollywood.
4053957	4057699	If I were in Hollywood right now and on prescription medications, I would be so worried.
4058559	4059139	for what it's worth.
4059460	4066164	But hey, Michael Jackson, if you want to have something to remember Michael Jackson by, of course, we were talking about how art lives on forever.
4066905	4069426	His Thriller video is actually free right now.
4070727	4071648	Or did it just end?
4071888	4072228	It ended.
4073629	4074910	I didn't get on and get the video.
4075190	4076291	It is an epic music video.
4076431	4080714	Like I wasn't sitting in my living room when I was in second grade watching it when it aired.
4080734	4082115	When did it end?
4082155	4082895	Wasn't it just today?
4083115	4084276	It was today, I guess.
4084596	4085457	Today's not over?
4085757	4087438	Well, it's 200 Microsoft points now.
4089760	4090701	Well, it was free.
4090901	4092082	Sorry if you didn't get your hands on it.
4092382	4094203	You know, I actually do remember when that aired.
4095344	4095684	I did too.
4095744	4097285	MTV used to air the whole darn thing.
4098066	4100287	Well, there was a special thing they were doing.
4100347	4103189	It was supposed to air at midnight.
4103429	4108213	I was in second grade, and my mom let me stay up to watch it when it aired at midnight.
4109565	4110026	Thank you, Frisbee.
4129915	4131436	Final Fantasy and Mega Man
4154594	4158815	Re-release or whatever, which was the original but with some minor tweaks.
4158855	4161696	It was the one that, it's sort of like what they put out on the PSP.
4162096	4164537	But not what they put out on the PSP, I want to clarify that.
4164637	4168278	Because the one they put out on the PSP was like really, it was almost high def and stuff.
4168378	4168578	Yes.
4168598	4169398	That was really fancy.
4169438	4175100	Yes, the one that they put, they added like some dungeons and stuff like that in the PS1 version or whatever.
4175720	4176080	But, um...
4176994	4177274	I don't know.
4203789	4208071	The one they had here on PlayStation 2 and GameCube because that's when they added in 7 and 8.
4208731	4214754	So, yeah, they have 1 through 6 available on a PlayStation 1 disc, but it's now on PlayStation Network over in Japan.
4215074	4219496	So hopefully, keep your fingers and toes crossed, maybe these games will come out over here.
4219796	4220977	At least that's what people are hoping.
4221297	4222798	My thought, don't bet on it.
4223118	4224859	I don't think either of these games are going to come out in the West.
4224879	4225519	Do you want to know why?
4225539	4227940	I don't think they're going to go back and bother to retranslate them.
4227980	4228400	Why would they?
4228420	4229061	They didn't before.
4229761	4230722	Final Fantasy 1 and 2 Final Fantasy 1 and 2
4252213	4267693	So maybe those will show up on PlayStation Network, I mean that's certainly a possibility I think it would be actually kind of rad to see the 5 and 6 compilations show up Final Fantasy 6, not a Final Fantasy game that's been visited in a little while And it's one of the greatest, if not the greatest, Final Fantasy game, period
4268534	4271216	4 is getting a lot of attention again thanks to the after years 6?
4273218	4283545	Oh my god, if they did an after years for 6 I'd be all over that Don't even tempt me I'm still all over 5 by the way I still think 5 is the best of them
4286547	4293670	GameGuru says Mega Man Anniversary Edition actually used the Rockman Complete Works versions of the NES games, so they've been translated.
4294190	4298012	Interesting perspective from GameGuru.
4298092	4298532	You know what?
4298652	4301033	If they did, it would be a pleasant surprise.
4301373	4304414	But at the same time, I do own the compilation on GameCube already.
4304454	4305635	I don't really need it.
4306455	4307936	Well, hey, you know what?
4308056	4313918	Maybe they'll move to, since they're going to be doing the digital download stuff now, maybe they're going to try to move more towards...
4314619	4323532	If they do a PlayStation 2 emulation or something like that, the full PlayStation 2 game downloads, just like they have with the PS3, at least with Burnout.
4324634	4326737	Maybe we'll see that when that happens.
4327984	4328485	Final Fantasy 1 is only $6.
4349520	4350601	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4376081	4376602	Mega Man in Final Fantasy!
4376622	4377543	Hey, that'd be kind of cool.
4396272	4398073	GameGuru also asked for Final Fantasy.
4398093	4399433	Is it the PlayStation 1 version?
4399473	4401454	Because Final Fantasy Origins came over here.
4401554	4403174	No, I know that, but I'm talking Final Fantasy 1.
4405094	4406955	It wasn't Origins, the 5-6 combo?
4406975	4408935	4-5s.
4409375	4414457	No, 4 and Trigger was another thing they called Final Fantasy Chronicles, I want to say.
4415917	4417377	Forgive me if my memory is fading.
4417417	4418738	It's been many years since that came out.
4419198	4419658	But there was...
4420558	4430464	Well, there was a time that I would have hopped all over this, but I actually bought a WonderSwan color so I could play Final Fantasy.
4430925	4432425	Still no word on Mystic Quest.
4433986	4434627	Who cares?
4436708	4437869	Loki, you got anything else for us?
4437889	4439550	Maybe one more story before we go to a break tonight?
4439870	4440651	Yeah, sure, why not?
4441671	4442612	Well, apparently...
4443430	4444391	No More Heroes 2
4471432	4473413	and I guess you can play her whenever you want.
4474434	4486000	They're expecting that there's going to be 50 boss battles and you'll also be able to play the bosses with either character and just to mix things up and there'll be different cutscenes and stuff like that for that.
4486560	4495465	And then finally it says the primary reason that Travis is taking on the United Assassins Association again is to avenge the death of his best friend from the first game, Bishop.
4496249	4501530	Unfortunately, I didn't play through the first game enough to probably get to any of those plot points.
4503571	4508572	I want to check out the sequel, though, and probably go back to the first one at some point.
4509172	4515753	Once again, that would probably require me to somehow slow down time, which I don't think I can.
4518254	4519314	Need more hours in the day.
4522232	4523654	I see you have a whole lot of stories there.
4523694	4528038	We're going to have so much stuff for Part B. Let's do one more.
4528759	4535325	Australia has decided to block online access to games with content beyond the rating MA15.
4536890	4543735	And apparently this will apply to, I guess, console games.
4543956	4552442	It says also famous MMORPGs such as Second Life and World of Warcraft very well may be affected by this new censorship policy.
4552722	4558426	Wait a minute, I thought I heard something about this a while ago where they were talking about that World of Warcraft would not be playable in Australia or something.
4558867	4560228	Is this like a further development or something?
4561529	4562309	Maybe I'm crazy.
4562509	4564331	I thought I heard something like this before.
4565362	4571065	Sorry, I don't mean to be pooping on your story, but this sounds like we've heard something like this before.
4571445	4572606	I remember that.
4573466	4579630	They will be very well maybe affected, it says, by this new censorship policy, if it pushes through.
4579650	4589835	It says that online games exemption on content ratings is the only reason why multiplayer games with user-generated environments are possibly in this country.
4590575	4591076	Without it...
4591876	4601298	Take one game user anywhere in the world to produce objectionable content in the game environment to make the Australian government ban the game for everyone.
4602399	4604579	They're just saying that someone's going to ruin it.
4606160	4615122	But yeah, and apparently, I guess, Second Life will probably be part of that since, well, Second Life's pretty objectionable as it is.
4617190	4617791	Interesting.
4618311	4619852	I guess, why did they want to ban it?
4619872	4620833	Just because they can't control it?
4620873	4621614	They can't release it?
4621874	4637688	Well, they found out, I guess, Second Life is about to be blocked, and it says that it will be barred under the Ministry's Sinister Filtering Plan, and this is kind of going back to the whole MA-15 thing, because I guess there's adult content in Second Life.
4638469	4641612	You can choose to do sexy things, as Destructoid puts it.
4641672	4643554	Whatever, there's adult things everywhere.
4645018	4647259	That was pretty adult to me, I mean, I don't know.
4648240	4648580	Alright.
4649581	4652902	Well, hey, before we go to break tonight, we have a couple things we want to get through.
4652942	4667050	We've got to get to the Classic Game of the Week, but I also want to get some voicemails out of the way, because it's been forever since we've played some voicemails here on the show, and I know we had a few on the line tonight that we wanted to play, and I've got to bring up the voicemails here.
4668211	4670212	First off, well, just listen.
4670532	4680229	just listen to these voicemails that were left on the line these are actual phone calls to our Skype line when we're not here you can call at any time 877-GAME-OLR and leave us a message
4682663	4683224	Yes, hello.
4683564	4685325	Is this Mr. Roberts?
4685886	4686406	Yes, hi.
4686606	4692791	This is the Pure Dildo Factory in Washington, New York.
4693412	4697014	We're calling in regards to your order for two dozen Big Black Fluffy Dildos.
4697695	4702098	We're having difficulty delivering your personal batch of two dozen Big Black Fluffy Dildos.
4702679	4703820	God damn it, Travis.
4707182	4707683	What?
4708663	4710205	I don't know.
4712782	4714143	Happy birthday, Rob!
4714223	4716824	Happy birthday, Rob, from all of us here at USO.
4717044	4720386	I do not condone Travis and his dildo selling.
4720646	4720826	Why?
4720886	4724748	We don't... That's a matter of YouTube, but happy birthday.
4724788	4725909	No, no, no.
4726029	4731391	Rob, we know you're missing your monthly shipment of big black dildos.
4731711	4736614	We know you like big floppy black dildos because we know you like putting big floppy black dildos in your butt.
4737134	4741298	So, absolutely, we know you just love having to do that.
4741738	4750526	So, anyways, happy birthday and, you know, you might want to check FedEx for your delivery of big black floppy dildos.
4752259	4760784	Well, thank you to our friends at Understation Live Sunday nights here on All Games Radio for leaving us that lovely little message that I'm sorry, but I find that highly offensive, you guys.
4760884	4768368	That was a really... I'm just, like, really offended that you would go and, like, joke about that kind of stuff on your show because, like, really?
4769168	4770889	Big, floppy black dildos?
4771130	4771450	Really?
4771870	4772290	Come on.
4772390	4772931	How old are we?
4772951	4773091	Like, 12?
4773711	4779574	Besides, everybody should know it's big, hard black dildos, not big, floppy black dildos.
4779594	4779754	Please.
4779914	4780335	Please.
4781274	4782055	Don't waste my time.
4783135	4784256	Hey, let's go to the next voicemail.
4786037	4786918	Hey, it's Misty.
4786938	4790240	Yeah, I know I'm kind of late as always.
4791161	4792302	Always with these damn things.
4793062	4795784	But yeah, congrats on seven years, guys.
4797145	4804150	Also, assuming I am off next Sunday, I damn well better be, though.
4806312	4807973	I will have an announcement to make.
4809254	4810815	So y'all better be fucking prepared.
4813271	4814712	I'll go ahead and let you go.
4814732	4816472	I gotta get ready for fucking work soon.
4817012	4817332	Bye.
4819053	4824595	Well, sorry to hear about your fucking work, but yeah, that's a little teaser if I've ever heard any.
4825095	4830617	Alright, we got one more voicemail and just to be warned, I think this is another one that came in on Saturday night.
4830837	4831637	That's all I need to say.
4834025	4838386	Hi, Billy Major with an exciting new product, Zombie Be Gone.

4867954	4868414	Goodbye.
4870534	4871194	Yeah.
4872535	4874815	I guess this is how some of us cope with bad news.
4874835	4876736	Alright, if you want to leave us a voicemail, 1-877-GAME-OLR
4881440	4885302	Oh Travis, still up to your old shenanigans after all these years.
4887783	4890565	Anyway, let's get to the classic game of the week, shall we?
4890645	4897328	DarkSakura always likes to take a trip through the archives and pick a game that you kids should be checking out and playing every week.
4898249	4902871	Well, you can play the game every week if you want, but she also gives you a new game each week that you can play.
4903511	4906293	So here it is, DarkSakura's classic game of the week.
4912102	4915665	So, DarkSakura, what game should the kids be playing this week?
4916365	4918707	They should be playing Dragon Force on the Sega Saturn.
4919833	4926940	Dragon Force is a combination real-time and turn-based strategy game.
4927000	4930903	It was actually released in America as a Working Designs translation.
4944488	4946129	We never did get the sequel over here.
4946169	4948089	However, I've seen the sequel and it's pretty freaking good.
4949710	4954932	But basically, you play as one of this continent's eight rulers.
4955913	4958794	And each ruler, of course, has a different goal.
4958914	4960214	One wants to rule the whole thing.
4960254	4961615	Someone wants to unite everyone.
4961655	4963115	People want to destroy it.
4964396	4968978	And so you move along these paths from towns to castles.
4969138	4971719	And you want to capture the castles and then...
4972677	4998045	you face off in battle so you have your strategy tactics where you're moving around from town to town across your map but then when you get to towns and castles you have your battle and you play as the general commanding their troops and so once you get to that part you're commanding these epic battles and it's you know you have a
5000170	5004972	Also, an in-game week where you do administrative stuff, where you tend to your troops.
5005952	5014894	You can increase the number of your troops, you can pay them more, you can capture enemy generals, get them to join your army, fortify castles, that type of stuff.
5016355	5018195	But the big thing is really the epic battles.
5019276	5019856	And, um...
5021315	5025878	This is probably one of the greatest video games of all time.
5025978	5030641	In fact, it won EGM's Game of the Month award in 1986.
5032843	5036826	If you skip up just a little bit on that video, you can get to the battle.
5038587	5039107	There you go.
5039487	5042249	You get to see your big armies.
5042389	5044691	And I've actually, there's battles with larger armies than that.
5049366	5049827	Thanks for watching!
5055802	5065809	It's like you really, to make this work for radio, that you kind of watch them like throwing, there's these big armies and they're kind of throwing fireballs and things like across this field.
5066149	5071112	And you watch the TV kind of scroll through this field until it gets to the other army.
5071212	5071892	Kind of interesting.
5071993	5073814	It's like a side-scrolling RTS game.
5073854	5076055	Yeah, it's kind of, I guess is the way to describe it.
5076075	5078357	The battles are turn-based like that.
5078417	5081779	So you basically, as you can see in that part, now they're actually doing melee.
5083462	5086523	You know, your goal is to capture or kill the other general.
5087644	5094887	And so, each general can attack each other, they've got their special abilities, but you can also send your troops to overrun the other, too.
5095727	5099989	You know, it's whether or not you want to leave yourself defended or whether or not you want to take over, you know, the other general.
5100409	5101610	So, it's pretty neat.
5103110	5105491	It's like you're commanding your own army.
5106212	5108653	Actually, I think they based Advance War sort of off this.
5110971	5115717	I think a little bit, but this definitely, you know, well, A, this is more of that medieval kind of thing.
5116458	5116978	It's epic.
5116998	5117759	Pretty epic, yeah.
5117779	5119842	This game is an epic game.
5119862	5121103	Just like Dragon Force the band.
5122525	5124047	Which, who knows, maybe that's where they got their name.
5125989	5126350	You never know.
5126724	5128326	Dragon Force is two words.
5128346	5129248	Just look for Dragon Force Sega Saturn.
5129268	5129548	You'll find it.
5141868	5146969	Just to let you know, the Saturn version is very, very hard to find.
5147169	5147689	Very hard to get.
5147729	5149229	It's a working designs title.
5150770	5151130	Good luck.
5152110	5161492	They did do a release for it as part of the Sega Ages PS2 collection, but that version is in Japanese.
5162352	5168033	I like that the troops rally, they yell and run into battle.
5168113	5169313	That's pretty hardcore.
5170968	5178274	You've got your troops falling in battle and doing their best to defend their generals, so it's pretty cool.
5179115	5185040	So a RTS RPG action-y kind of game that's so hard to describe otherwise.
5185441	5187682	It's very hard to find here in America, but good luck.
5187783	5191125	Maybe you'll find something out there that's playable.
5191306	5196130	Well, in Japan it was published by Sega, but it's a working designs release over here.
5197028	5221788	Dragon Force is the classic game of the week and I believe that's all there is to say on that so that's going to do it for part A tonight of Orange Lounge Radio but fear not we have plenty more to get to tonight including the mailbag, the FUs of the week your calls and more gaming news and we're going to get to that all after a quick break here in studio at Orange Lounge Radio so stay tuned guys we'll be right back with more of Orange Lounge Radio
5227876	5237380	Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio on this June the 28th of 2009 where we're celebrating our 7th anniversary of Orange Lounge Radio with nothing of particular special notice.
5237700	5243643	We're just doing the same old crap we always do, although we got really in-depth tonight in part A, kind of having a long side discussion.
5244063	5246545	But, you know, we're just having a really chill night.
5246685	5250728	No pre-planned list of topics to cover tonight.
5250748	5254431	We're just doing whatever we want to talk about tonight in the latest and greatest in gaming news.
5254791	5256012	We'll get back into some more news.
5256032	5258174	I'm hoping Loki has a few more stories for us.
5258374	5260636	Maybe one more story, then I'm sure Jamie's got a couple too.
5261198	5267623	Sorry, I'm reminiscing about the steak that I had at Daily Grill back during E3, because that was the best steak ever.
5267683	5268484	Where's Daily Grill?
5268504	5269184	I've not heard of that.
5269405	5273508	Well, this was in LA, but they actually have one in San Francisco and one in Brentwood.
5274008	5275029	Have you ever been to Ruth Chris?
5276690	5277471	Uh, no.
5277551	5279433	I'm telling you, that is an incredible steak.
5279453	5280273	It's expensive.
5280814	5282795	If you and the wife go there, you're going to spend $80.
5283936	5286438	But it is good steak.
5286959	5288380	That's my favorite steak right there.
5289369	5290189	Thanks for watching!
5309258	5314022	Yes, uh, anywho, um, we've got some news.
5314322	5317245	Let's see which we'll pick here.
5318686	5322109	Um, how about, let's talk about how crappy home is.
5323270	5327794	Fewer than one in three PS3 systems are connected to the PlayStation Home.
5328254	5339081	According to Peter Edward, the director of PlayStation Home for Sony Computer Entertainment Europe, PlayStation Home has gained 7 million users worldwide, with 3 million in Europe alone.
5341483	5347587	But, of course, with 21 million PS3 sold worldwide, that's less than one-third.
5349548	5350609	He considers it...
5353642	5357264	Well, he considers Home, of course, the starting point for PlayStation 3 Online.
5357584	5361786	Of course, I would say he's a little bit biased since he is the director of PlayStation Home.
5361806	5362886	He kind of has to say that.
5363387	5365668	But, I don't know.
5365848	5371731	It's just... If a lot of people are like me, they just... It's neat.
5372031	5372951	It's a neat idea.
5373111	5375232	But, I don't know.
5375492	5376373	I just don't want to go...
5378200	5381002	Okay, but here's my thing.
5381022	5389026	I realize that's how the blogs are kind of skewing this, is that, oh, nobody's on PlayStation Home, but since when was 7 million a bad number of people to have using your thing?
5389066	5390827	I mean, isn't that actually kind of good?
5390847	5395929	I mean, at risk of sounding like a Sony fanboy, is 1 in 3, in this case, really that bad?
5396390	5398791	Because, yes, I understand Home is free.
5398951	5402452	I guess... But think about how many people are buying their PlayStation 3s, let's be honest.
5402492	5407914	And here's my little, you know, let's look at both sides of the coin, is that I actually think these numbers are pretty good for home.
5408234	5411936	But the bad side is, I think there's a lot of people that are buying their PlayStation 3s just for Blu-ray players.
5411996	5415737	I think their expectations were, though, that 100% of the people would be, you know...
5417137	5419279	are 100% of people on Xbox Live.
5419419	5426382	Granted, you have to pay for Xbox Live, but I would bet there's not even 100% of people that have an Xbox profile.
5426942	5432305	I bet there's a lot of people that buy their Xbox 360 and just put the game in and play.
5432325	5434967	You don't always have to sign into profiles and stuff to play games.
5436407	5440549	I bet you there's a lot of folks that don't bother with all this other stuff.
5441230	5443371	They just use their console to play games and that's it.
5444392	5445072	Yeah, I suppose.
5445933	5449314	But, you know, it's not the splash they were hoping to make.
5450415	5453216	I just don't think 7 million is that bad of a number, I gotta say.
5453916	5459278	I'm surprised, yeah, SSJ100Matt in our chatroom, chat.orange.radar.com says, there are 7 million PS3 owners?
5459298	5463860	Actually, there's 21 million PS3 owners.
5464200	5465501	I'm one of them, I think we all are.
5466192	5468273	That's what I actually just said, all three of us had one.
5469834	5471815	It took me a little while to get on board.
5473556	5478598	My question, though, is this accounts or is this actually users, individual consoles?
5478638	5481000	Because, I don't know about you, but I have four accounts on my...
5482865	5487989	DJ Morpheus in chat says, and you many of those owners now PS3 paperweight owners or owners of an expensive Blu-ray?
5509787	5510528	DarkSakura.com
5523596	5524337	Actually, I do.
5525137	5526038	My feet with socks.
5526198	5526638	No, I'm kidding.
5527619	5535664	Speaking of PlayStation Network, actually, they want to expand the cameras through a broader online service.
5535724	5545331	So they want to use TV, the cameras, your phones, and they're thinking of launching that around spring 2010, or at least that's their general idea.
5546131	5550574	There was an article in Fortune about what they want to do.
5551714	5557878	It's basically saying that they want it to be the ultimate multimedia experience.
5558638	5561740	If you have the multiple Sony products, they're all linked together.
5562600	5563361	Kaz Hirai
5565642	5577252	was actually quoted saying that the service will overlay the backbone of the PlayStation Network but be broader and more open so you'd be able to download movies to TV, share photos between devices, friends.
5577772	5579233	So basically they want to make Xbox Live.
5583136	5584017	But I don't understand.
5584097	5586439	What's this whole camera supposed to be?
5586579	5587820	I don't get it.
5588381	5590322	They're saying that it's just part of the whole thing.
5590582	5591083	They want to...
5592518	5596680	Incorporate all of their electronic products into this big network.
5597320	5597620	I see.
5597940	5599421	Okay.
5599541	5601902	It's spreading around the company brand.
5602042	5602402	Why not?
5602922	5604503	Where do you think most of those movies come from?
5604623	5606224	Sony Pictures, right?
5606284	5609505	It's saying that basically they're going to start small and work from there.
5609525	5616728	To just basically look at all the different services that function with each device and then roll out their plan.
5618240	5630035	I don't think I would ever buy a camera on PlayStation Network, but if even only a small handful of people do, it's not that much resources to probably put this up for sale on there, so why not?
5630555	5633779	You know what I'd actually like to see do if they're really working on networking people?
5633919	5634100	Huh?
5634713	5640174	is actually have a true teleconference, video conference ability.
5640414	5642495	Can't you kind of do that with Xbox 360?
5642535	5643775	But that's just one-to-one, right?
5643795	5645555	You can't really do more than one camera chat?
5645695	5648876	Yeah, it'd be neat, though, if you could do, like, your multiple chat room.
5649156	5649396	Hmm.
5650156	5650516	Interesting.
5652697	5654277	But, anyway, that's just my idea.
5654437	5656597	Don't steal my idea, Sony, or I'll stab you in the face.
5657958	5659058	Shove crayons down your throat.
5659458	5659978	Well, wait a minute.
5659998	5663959	Didn't they have the old, on PlayStation 2, wasn't there, iToyChat?
5665358	5665938	There was.
5666538	5667699	I didn't bother with that.
5667899	5675640	Well, it came out so late that everyone had moved on, I think, to the next generation of gaming, and people weren't really talking about iToyChat anymore.
5676261	5686883	I remember this was a subject of a lot of mocking early on because we could see the potential for abuse in this thing, and they had talked about moderation and all that.
5687283	5690584	I'm wondering, whatever happened, did this game actually come out?
5691895	5694520	I'm wondering if it didn't just get pulled before it ever came out.
5694920	5696543	Now I gotta check it out.
5697365	5698406	I totally gotta check it out now.
5699689	5700430	I'll research that.
5700470	5701612	You talk about something else, Loki.
5702473	5703776	Okay.
5704297	5704958	Let's see...
5706152	5707253	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5722947	5723328	S, Actdeft, Drew,
5739068	5740269	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
5764987	5765468	Thanks for watching!
5778528	5780469	and also Microsoft.
5780589	5789093	The Pro system apparently is going to be phased out and something else will come up in its place.
5789134	5793256	Apparently the Pro will be replaced by the 120GB Elite system.
5793316	5797158	Now wouldn't it be awesome though if they dropped the price of the Elite to the price of the Pro system now?
5798158	5800359	Then they may come out with something later on that's even more.
5800419	5802779	Maybe something with Project Intel built in.
5803279	5803620	I don't know.
5805200	5806620	Or maybe a slimmer 360.
5807061	5807441	Who knows?
5807481	5808641	That might be neat.
5809001	5817523	But apparently the 120GB Elite will undergo a price cut in September.
5818524	5820864	And there will be some new bundles coming out in October.
5821705	5826566	That makes sense because they're releasing new bundles all the time.
5828473	5830494	By the way, I did the research on iToyChat.
5831014	5832194	It's kind of hard to figure it out.
5832254	5835135	I mean, if this game did come out, it kind of landed with a thud.
5835775	5837916	It looks like it only came out in the UK.
5838316	5842017	That's what I'm able to kind of put together here, is that it did come out in the UK in 2005.
5842057	5845258	That must have been a long time ago we were talking about this game.
5845278	5847639	I remember selling it, so I don't think it actually came out over here.
5848259	5848659	Interesting.
5849079	5851140	I do remember selling some really stupid things.
5852180	5854120	Although iToyChat I don't think was ever one of them.
5854280	5873364	And I just, you know, again, I hate to bring up an old subject, but iToy is what makes me nervous of things like Project Natal and these other motion controllers is that, well, especially Project Natal, not so much the Sony motion control because the Sony motion control feels to me like it's more of like a souped up Wii type thing where there's sensors in the controller itself and the camera.
5873865	5879686	But Natal that relies apparently only on a camera, it makes me nervous because iToy was a camera too.
5879946	5880386	It was great.
5880606	5881747	DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
5910894	5915120	and Hell, we used it for our webcam for a while.
5917203	5917544	I don't know.
5917684	5921690	I'm more confident, though, that they would test this and test this and test this.
5922411	5926797	They're not going to just splash the market with this Project Natal and have it be shit.
5928217	5929038	Thank you for watching!
5944059	5947220	DDR, hey, there's hands and feet mode, which sucks.
5947701	5955304	And yet, they decide, hey, let's do Wiimote and Nunchuck mode, which, surprisingly enough, also sucks.
5955964	5960886	And then, now there's the Wii Balance Board mode, which also sucks.
5961387	5973592	So maybe they should go and learn their lesson from this, which is the extra modes, while an interesting idea and maybe slightly considered innovative, maybe, that's a stretch, they will always suck.
5975615	5978158	and 8 Arrow Mode, I'm going to guess, it's going to suck.
6000379	6001620	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6020920	6045812	well they went back through the hole that they made they climbed back up through the hole they do have surveillance tape but no sign of the criminal yet but the thing that makes this most hilarious of all they didn't walk away with a damn thing so this guy just wasted everybody's time in this case and whenever we hear about a dumb criminal I'm sure it always inspires us to get a little angsty here on the show so yeah let's do the FUs of the week
6063423	6066446	F you to pain and heat.
6067987	6068747	Extreme heat.
6070869	6072150	Whoops, didn't mean to cut the music out there.
6072170	6072710	Sorry, Loki.
6073691	6074992	Um, it's hot.
6075973	6077214	So if you do it, being hot.
6079396	6081257	I would also say F you to the fact that it's hot.
6081277	6083179	It's hotter than hell in here.
6083819	6084800	Not in here, but out there.
6085501	6088163	And then I would say F you as well to, um...
6090428	6091550	I had something else on my mind.
6091630	6093191	If you'd have gone to the doctor on my birthday.
6093412	6093932	That's no fun.
6093952	6095574	Who wants to go to the doctor for their birthday?
6097036	6097776	If you'd be getting old.
6099899	6101901	I like the age I was when I started this show.
6101921	6101901	24?
6102381	6104043	I think I was then.
6104063	6105545	31 now.
6105685	6105925	What?
6107247	6108508	Things get better in your 30s.
6108548	6109109	They really do.
6109434	6111075	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6133704	6134745	Oh god, I have that too.
6134805	6136766	Yeah, why don't we just get into release dates here.
6137026	6140349	Tonight's just kind of a very whatever kind of show.
6140369	6142090	Fuck it night here on Orange Lounge Radio.
6142230	6142550	Why not?
6142610	6144251	It's our little seventh birthday here.
6144751	6145772	We're just screwing around tonight.
6146453	6150155	DarkSakura's going to kick off some release dates as soon as she gets it brought up there on her monitor.
6150795	6154378	Start off with the UK and what's coming out overseas across the pond.
6155018	6156640	Oh yeah, it's July, isn't it?
6157020	6157600	Or it will be.
6158761	6162885	So let's go ahead and start off with our July releases.
6162945	6163605	How's that sound?
6164446	6164706	Yay.
6165807	6168549	Ooh, God, did they actually give me any July releases on here?
6169710	6169930	No.
6170691	6171992	They're not listing July releases.
6173433	6174374	Well, what good is that?
6176590	6177010	Oh, there we go.
6177170	6177370	Sorry.
6178351	6179571	Brain broken.
6179711	6179971	Sorry.
6180711	6182092	The heat has melted her brain.
6182752	6183692	God, it almost did.
6184012	6186893	On the second, we have The Punisher, No Mercy on PlayStation 3.
6187853	6192075	We have, on the third, Call of Juarez, Bound in Blood.
6193095	6196576	Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince on a bunch of systems.
6197216	6198917	Street Fighter 4 on PC.
6200017	6201538	Tiger Woods PGA Tour 10.
6201818	6202518	And then that's it.
6207691	6209112	I'm going to get some Monkey Island after that.
6209712	6210092	Sweet.
6211493	6218636	Let's get into some Japanese release dates and see what's coming out on the other side of the pond over across the Pacific.
6219736	6225499	Only some price cuts on the Xbox 360 this week for Bioshock, Infinite Undiscovery, and Shin's Sengoku Musou 5.
6226319	6230601	All getting price cuts this week, which I believe that last one was Dynasty Warriors, if I'm not mistaken.
6232342	6234383	Dynasty Warriors 5 Empires 6 Empires
6251896	6258901	Looks to be a pretty slow week over there in Japan, but if you are still a fan of the PlayStation 2, I got nothing for you this week.
6258941	6261102	But there's a baseball game coming out next week, you can look for that.
6262403	6268207	Coming out on the Nintendo DS, we have Mina no Oikake Yasan.
6268667	6273890	So it must be some type of drawing game, because I recognize the oikake from being that whole drawing on the internet thing.
6274250	6278033	That looks to be exactly what this is, probably some type of share with your friends drawing game.
6278653	6280535	Draw a penis on the internet!
6293849	6294970	Hatsune Miku Project Diva Vocaloid
6313359	6318623	You know, you input the words, the tune and everything, and then she sings it.
6318863	6322245	This looks to be a type of music game, actually, coming out of there.
6322285	6324507	Seriously, what's it on?
6325328	6325728	PSP.
6326348	6328910	Yeah, having a Vocaloid game on PSP is pretty cool.
6329431	6331652	Rob, really, I'm going to find you something to play.
6332053	6332473	Interesting.
6332493	6341140	Yeah, you actually kind of, this is a rhythm game that you put in these, kind of another type of syncing game, and it makes her dance.
6342051	6346335	Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince SteamBot Chronicles Battle Tournament
6364714	6370496	Street Fighter 4 on PC, Mega Man Star Force 3, Red Joker, Black Ace, Ice Age, Dawn of the Dinosaur
6383374	6395204	and Grand Theft Auto 3, Vice City and San Andreas are all coming together in a brand new PC trilogy that's being re-released.
6395765	6399769	Calawara is Bound in Blood on PS3 and Xbox 360.
6400870	6405414	Treasure World, which is a DS game that uses your Wi-Fi signals to find treasure.
6406616	6408398	Rugu Twisted Towers Rugu Twisted Towers
6421830	6428954	BlazBlue, Calamity Trigger, sort of a launch limited edition coming out on PS3 and Xbox 360 as well.
6432076	6432856	Let's see.
6433577	6441341	And then a smaller 360 game that not a lot of people have heard about, Infernal, Hell's Vengeance, which was on PC a little bit earlier this year.
6442142	6445163	That's making its way out to Xbox 360 at a budget $39.99.
6446504	6449866	I guess that's not really too budget, but more budget than full price.
6450707	6469883	Rugu Attack which is on the DS also another Rugu sequel and then that's it for this week but I'm kind of happy to see Arma 2 is coming out next week and I still haven't gotten a chance to play the actual Steam version but it looks cool
6471468	6473751	Alright, so backing up to the Japanese release dates a little bit.
6473771	6475193	DarkSakura, you sent me this YouTube.
6475253	6476695	What the hell is this I'm about to look at here?
6476835	6480060	This is what the Vocaloid is like.
6481301	6481982	You want to turn it up?
6482203	6482303	Oh.
6484590	6492972	This is just some really weird version of Don't Worry Be Happy.
6493472	6502735	Well, I picked something in English, but you input the words and the tune and everything, and it plays it back like she's singing, she's your virtual idol.
6504256	6505116	Oh, interesting.
6505156	6507257	So you're actually pushing the buttons to sing?
6507737	6511819	No, you just input everything ahead of time and then watch it play through.
6512159	6513080	Uh-oh.
6514060	6516942	If there's one of her doing Carameldansen, I'll find it.
6517342	6518503	No thank you, that's alright.
6519283	6521824	But I think that that's... So this is more of a music maker.
6522605	6524025	Well, the PC ones are.
6524085	6533490	I don't know exactly how the PSP one is going to be, but ever since the first one came out, there's been a ton of new vocaloids and everything.
6533650	6534090	It's pretty big.
6539837	6542278	I think this is what a DarkSakura wants me to show.
6542398	6545959	I think that's an animation that someone did.
6546059	6549561	Alright, let's get back into some more news.
6549581	6551521	Loki, you got anything for us?
6563973	6565153	Yeah, sure, why not?
6565774	6581519	Apparently, EA is calling their Sims 3 leak its demo program, saying that, you know, you've identified our secret marketing campaign, EA CEO John... I'm not even going to try to pronounce his last name.
6582280	6583440	Riccitello, I guess.
6583460	6584160	I don't know.
6584540	6585901	That was actually pretty accurate.
6586212	6595416	Yes, it's a form of large-scale piracy, I guess, was a pre-release version of The Sims 3.
6596697	6607422	Basically saying that it was a way to figure out some data and stuff from this experiment.
6608443	6614006	They've gotten a lot of people to buy the game based on trying this version of the game that leaked out, I guess.
6615322	6615742	I don't know.
6615762	6616803	That didn't fix any problems.
6616843	6616883	So...
6644560	6653567	I think it sounds to me like they're making excuses because a leak like this had to have come from inside since it was leaked out weeks early.
6654848	6659492	He's doing a cover your ass and it just makes him sound pathetic.
6661714	6665297	So, well, hey, whatever makes you sleep better at night, I guess.
6667785	6672331	Yeah, it kind of sounds more like, oops, how do we explain this one or something?
6672351	6674413	Ha ha ha, he fell for it.
6674734	6682323	Well, I think what he's saying also, too, is what they're going to try to move towards later on is selling more services and
6682583	6683525	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
6698806	6702888	At the end of the day, what's going to end up happening... Except they'll probably not sell a lot of that.
6703028	6704749	And you know what else is going to happen at the end of the day?
6705189	6708351	Just like all the expansions for Sims 2, those will get leaked out as well.
6708451	6713213	So all your plans for download content, it's not going to work.
6714212	6740262	just to say also everything that's available on the Sims 3 store is available for download through BitTorrent people have already done it people are already doing it's just really starting but people are already starting to do a few custom items already it's not going to be too much longer you can download everything that's there in the store
6741189	6743991	But if you really like the game, you should just go buy it.
6744852	6745552	I bought my game.
6745672	6746713	Encourage them to make a Sims 4.
6746753	6748794	If you really, really like the Sims.
6749054	6751696	Although Sims 4 is probably inevitable someday.
6752157	6752917	Many years down the line.
6752957	6754778	I just want a nice graphical upgrade to Sims 2.
6756119	6757861	Sequels a successful franchise?
6757961	6758141	No.
6759810	6765333	Well, speaking of sequels to successful franchises... I want them to make pretty faces and better hair.
6765413	6768075	Well, I want pretty faces and better hair in Final Fantasy XI.
6768115	6769735	It might actually make me play that game again.
6770216	6770716	No, not really.
6770756	6772317	Not with Final Fantasy XIV on the horizon.
6772617	6775439	But Final Fantasy XI's been getting some crap this week.
6775779	6778240	Apparently, they got sued this week for $5 million.
6778600	6784023	Apparently, it's because they supposedly, allegedly, I guess is the word to use, they...
6785424	6786105	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
6808621	6813282	Deceptive advertising, unfair and undisclosed business practices Licensing of the online game software disguised as a sale
6825626	6844925	monthly fees or fees to play the online games penalties for late payment of the fees interest charges for late payment of the fees charges while the online game account is suspended termination of the right to use the online games for late payment of the fees user restrictions and conditions related to the online games termination of game data for payment of the fees
6845848	6847529	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6871101	6872523	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
6889163	6896749	and in your agreement it says that you are paying for this, this, and this, that your lender has the right to charge this, this, and this if you don't do shit.
6897230	6897650	Guess what?
6897710	6898971	Same way in that type of contract.
6899411	6900952	You have to read it.
6901273	6902734	This person has no right to sue.
6902774	6905296	She's completely responsible for her own peace.
6905316	6909419	And they even ask you when you're signing up, be sure to read this contract.
6909439	6913062	Do you accept these terms and whatever?
6913082	6913162	Yeah.
6914103	6915564	It's not their fault she didn't read it.
6915664	6916745	Well, this is what I don't understand.
6916825	6918346	I played this game for three years.
6919027	6921950	I had never heard of them charging interest.
6922770	6925693	Not a single person in my link shell ever talked about this.
6925853	6928315	It's for late payments, I guess.
6928996	6931999	But if you pay late, there's no paying late.
6932299	6934281	You pay late because they disable your account.
6934681	6935322	You auto-pay.
6935742	6938765	Right, and if your credit card bounces or whatever, you can't log in.
6939568	6941049	Yeah, but, like, I don't know.
6941830	6944632	Do they charge you before the month is up?
6944652	6946594	Say, like, I pay for a month or whatever like that.
6946954	6948395	They charge me at the beginning or the end of the month.
6948415	6953620	Because if they charge me at the end of the month, then, you know, you've paid for that month and you owe them money, I guess, for that.
6954160	6954440	I don't know.
6954460	6955982	I think the beginning of the month makes sense.
6956522	6957303	I don't understand.
6957363	6959845	I think we need to hear more about what specifically this lawsuit is about.
6959885	6962227	Because the way it's worded, it makes it sound like a dummy.
6962347	6963868	And on top of all that, $5 million?
6963888	6964188	Really?
6964589	6964709	Yeah.
6966089	6969235	For something that sounds like they just fucked up and didn't pay their bill.
6969255	6970898	The customer service could have just resolved.
6971419	6973463	Well, maybe that's the problem.
6974901	6976422	But, you know, I don't know.
6976462	6978664	Yeah, $5 million is a little extreme.
6978864	6982446	But, I mean, if it's being split among 100,000 people, because it's class action, right?
6983307	6985989	So, technically, all 100,000 should be entitled to their chunk of it.
6986029	6987510	So, they all get, what, 50 bucks a pop?
6987530	6987510	5,000.
6988010	6989651	Is it that much?
6990011	6990672	I can't do math.
6990712	6990932	Sorry.
6991432	6991632	Yeah.
6991873	6992273	But still.
6993033	6993614	Well, wait.
6993754	6995155	I think it's still frivolous.
6995175	6995375	50 times 100,000.
6996015	6997537	I think it's still highly frivolous.
6998017	6999018	Well, it's still a 50 bucks.
6999038	6999638	That's, you know.
7001249	7004611	And they're not going to get $50 either because lawyers got to get paid.
7027785	7028426	How about the mailbag?
7048069	7048709	I don't know, it's um...
7064946	7065706	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7092380	7096703	This has got to be one of those theaters that only seats 20 people in it.
7096943	7099665	It's a real tiny, tiny community theater.
7099685	7102647	I can't imagine this is a big production.
7104048	7116676	The gameplay celebration is apparently three performances executed through video games in video game styles, three game party nights, and three weeks of rot-your-brain video game madness.
7117556	7132707	And apparently their video game party nights include an MMORPG night where you will play your favorite massively multiplayer online role-playing game in a theater, rock band karaoke, and then another night will be a chiptunes dance party.
7133668	7134288	That sounds fun.
7135409	7138051	But this sounds so off-Broadway, it's like in New Jersey.
7138191	7146176	What's kind of neat, though, is what they have, it's live actors on a stage with no set work, and then the sets are actually like...
7147122	7149525	Artwork from Adventure Games, which is kind of neat.
7150145	7151267	Okay, that's kind of neat, I guess.
7152428	7155571	What a bunch of nerds, but I can applaud them.
7155812	7159476	And they actually, it's kind of cool, they've got a little score tally running.
7159576	7160116	Nice.
7163089	7164471	Alright, are we ready for some emails?
7164911	7165412	Yes.
7165432	7169817	Alright, whenever you want to interact with the show, Mailbag at OrangeLaunchRadio.com is a great place to do it.
7170197	7172520	We jump in there and read some of your emails every week.
7172580	7177606	The lovely DarkSakura is going to dive in the mailbag head first and see what mails come up for her to read tonight.
7177626	7178807	Don't forget the hazmat suit, Rob.
7179027	7180769	Mailbag at OrangeLaunchRadio.com
7187745	7195029	First email, I just listened to last week's show and I would compare it more to Doom and the start of the first person shooter genre.
7195069	7197031	It's about BB&A vs. DJ Hero.
7197591	7207217	When a new game genre first appears to the general public, it seems like the best way to classify it is by calling it a clone of the first or most popular game in the genre.
7207617	7212820	For a more recent example, look at how sandbox games were called GTA clones until a few years ago.
7213480	7217162	And that's from Corky842, who also sends an addendum.
7217562	7217942	P.S.
7218162	7220683	The last email was brought to you by Beer in the Palm Pre.
7223484	7224225	Wow.
7224985	7226606	I don't know if I have a lot else to add to that.
7227006	7228306	That's an interesting comparison.
7228466	7233508	I didn't even think of the Doom, like the whole Doom, Quake, Wolfenstein type of connection last week.
7234209	7235129	But very interesting point.
7236810	7238490	Cheeseburger says, I miss MJ.
7238670	7239491	Dude, you're too young.
7243684	7245415	um, this one, um
7247599	7251381	Hey y'all, I downloaded the new iPod Touch firmware tonight.
7251441	7253723	First of all, I paid $10 for this.
7253843	7254143	Why?
7254763	7258245	Is this really good, or am I an Apple lemming, or both?
7258866	7260907	Second, this update actually looks interesting.
7260967	7265569	The copy and paste is not really what I'm used to, but what was I expecting?
7265630	7267951	Parental controls are good, if you're a parent.
7268611	7270152	As I am not, it's useless to me.
7270792	7276936	The shake-to-shuffle feature is nice, though, and really useful when my baby's crying album kicks in.
7278228	7283012	Well, that's awesome for Apple to charge for firmware updates.
7283413	7284334	I didn't pay for mine.
7287377	7288317	You don't pay on the phones.
7288337	7290439	You only pay on the iTouch or whatever.
7290499	7291700	Oh, how generous of them.
7291801	7292061	I know.
7296032	7298995	3.
7296192	7298995	Assuming you didn't cut me off with the baby comment.
7299715	7302418	They've done something to improve typing messages and I love them for it.
7302578	7307902	Landscape typing makes the buttons noticeably bigger, an improvement that helps me a lot.
7308263	7309864	Now I don't mistype every other word.
7310044	7310445	Yay!
7311025	7312266	Well, that's all for now.
7312807	7313507	Stay care.
7314909	7319476	Redertainment This message was typed on iPod Touch, which I have and you don't.
7321840	7324845	Actually, I do really like the upgrade.
7324925	7329112	I like having five panels for my apps instead of the three.
7330778	7333260	and I'm pretty pleased with it.
7333700	7334941	Pretty pleased.
7335181	7339365	Also, I really like some of the changes that they've made to the contacts.
7339385	7339825	It's okay.
7339845	7341606	I like that I can text and landscape now.
7341786	7343468	That's the biggest improvement.
7343508	7344128	Same with email.
7344508	7347491	But I'm not liking the fact that the phone just seems to run slower.
7348011	7351294	I guess with all that stuff in there, a lot of my apps feel like they're running slower.
7352254	7354094	Mine are showing an improvement.
7354675	7361596	I'm hoping that with the 3.1 that's inevitable at some point, you know, the minor tweaks, that'll fix that all up.
7361996	7362516	That's what I hope.
7363416	7363976	Next email?
7364897	7365077	Sure.
7365617	7372078	Dear OLR Crew, I just wanted to briefly chime in on something you went over last week, that being Guitar Hero Van Halen.
7372478	7375879	I remember when they announced the game, I was actually somewhat interested.
7377617	7394777	I love Sammy Hagar Most of the music by them that I love is when Sammy Hagar was the lead singer There's only a couple of songs that I enjoyed that were when David Lee Roth was singing with the group
7395798	7397659	I completely agree with this, by the way.
7398800	7402722	So I suppose that in the opinion of many, I'm not a true fan of the group.
7403362	7405143	That is just my own musical taste.
7405663	7409185	Perhaps now there might be an opportunity for Rock Band to pick up the remaining music.
7409705	7411006	I'd freaking love to play Dreams.
7411946	7413609	Thanks for reading, as always, Ossifer.
7414089	7414410	P.S.
7414490	7419037	I just want to note that it was very painful news on Thursday, June 25th, when Michael Jackson died.
7419437	7422182	May he rest in peace, but forever live on through his music.
7422803	7427329	And what a great tribute that would be if Harmonix gave us the Thriller album as Rock Band DLC.
7428038	7428919	Don't count on it.
7429339	7430060	No.
7430460	7431200	Wishful thinking.
7431341	7434823	I realize everybody's still wrapped up.
7434863	7438306	I don't want to re-get into this topic, but everybody's still wrapped up in the Michael Jackson thing.
7439127	7439887	Don't count on it.
7440328	7443630	Something like that is going to be years and years in the making because guess what?
7444431	7447553	The rights to that stuff now is all going to be up in the air.
7447933	7453798	With the debt that man left behind, if rumors are to be believed, these type of struggles will go on for years.
7454459	7456160	Did you see Misty sent us clips?
7457674	7458294	No, I didn't.
7458374	7459955	Misty sent us a bunch of clips.
7460055	7461856	I think that you should hop into the mailbag too.
7463796	7464217	I might.
7464337	7465257	Oh my gosh, wow.
7465737	7467498	I might have to play those during the afterbirth tonight.
7467818	7468118	Alright.
7468498	7468758	Okay.
7469539	7470179	Thank you, Misty.
7474808	7477871	I thought he's still rich, but his company's bankrupt.
7478752	7481676	To be honest, I don't know, nor do I feel like it's any of my business.
7481716	7482597	I kind of don't care.
7483218	7486682	I sound rude, but it's not my finances.
7486982	7488464	I got my own finances to worry about.
7488564	7489665	Well, we've got two more emails.
7490365	7490986	Well, now to business.
7491006	7491346	Ooh, so serious.
7511101	7511522	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft
7529079	7533781	Well, it caught me crazy and stuff, but now I'm glad Konami didn't bring Guitar Freaks and Drum Mania stateside.
7534322	7541886	That way we got Guitar Hero and Rock Band, which are truly great and haven't lost their appeal to the public, no matter how much Activision is milking Guitar Hero, though.
7542566	7546588	They did bring Guitar Freaks and Drum Mania to this side of the pond, I guess.
7546668	7548209	In the arcades.
7548769	7552591	Yes, in the arcades, but also as Rock Revolution, unfortunately.
7553352	7553972	That doesn't count.
7555163	7566827	I still wondered what would have happened if Konami brought Guitadora, but considering how Rock Revolution did, I'm glad they didn't.
7567307	7571569	Granted, it wouldn't have been the same game, but still, look at the way DDR and pop music are going.
7571989	7578251	Not good at all, and Guitar Freaks Germania would have taken the same route and doomed the rhythm games for years to come.
7579231	7582234	So, thank you Konami for not giving us Guitar Freaks and Drum Mania.
7582615	7587060	Rock Revolution proved what it would have happened to Guitadora over the years.
7587580	7592906	Now don't screw up and don't release another bad port of Beat Mania because of Scratch and DJ Hero.
7593326	7597070	Heck, forget about Bimani and the States and let K-Set J do their thing.
7597491	7600354	At least they know if the record breaks, don't try to fix it.
7602791	7603791	Thanks for reading this email.
7603811	7607633	And again, congrats on the seven years entertaining the internet every Sunday.
7608093	7608393	P.S.
7608453	7610794	If Jason Enos were dead, he'd be rolling in his grave right now.
7611795	7612495	Well, he's not.
7612575	7613976	He's alive and well.
7614116	7615357	He's somewhere else.
7615397	7615937	He's at EA now.
7616437	7617217	I think I can say that.
7617358	7618658	He's moved on to a better place.
7619419	7628323	Look, I don't know if I agree very much with the whole rock revolution is what guitar freaks would have become.
7628863	7629744	DarkSakura, Luke, Carameldansen
7654597	7667917	and use the Bomani brand to do it knowing that they wouldn't be able to say anything about it because Konami did have Guitar Freaks they did have the Bomani thing and just that they just piss poor execution stop being lazy
7669855	7692249	and hopefully they're learning their lesson when this game is an embarrassment Rock Revolution, there's really no nice way for me to say it with as much nice things as Konami has put out in the past and people that I even know there and so on there is no nice way for me to say it Rock Revolution was an embarrassment to that company and it should never happen again
7696061	7696601	Any more emails?
7697402	7698062	Oh, yes, we did.
7699123	7699623	Last one.
7700263	7701504	Hey, Rob, Jamie, and Matt.
7701544	7703685	This is long-time listener SSJ100Matt.
7704346	7708928	I first wanted to congratulate and praise you on your seventh anniversary.
7709008	7714231	It's amazing that it was a little less than six years ago that I first started listening to the show.
7714732	7720035	I first discovered OLR through a friend who recommended the now-long-defunct Wednesday show Outside the Box.
7720535	7722997	From there, I discovered the Sunday show, and the rest was history.
7723017	7723777	Okay.
7723957	7727741	I know you guys get enough praise as it is and for the sake of this email I will keep it short.
7727861	7728642	No, I like praise.
7728682	7729883	Keep it up.
7730163	7732205	I like that somebody remembers Outside the Box.
7732286	7733607	I barely remember that show.
7734208	7734908	That's crazy.
7734928	7737391	That was a side show I hosted years ago with some friends.
7738227	7744210	You three have sacrificed seven years of your Sunday nights for the sake of us, the listener, and have never asked for anything in return.
7744691	7754716	We, the listeners, can never make that amount of dedication up to you, except continue to listen, tell to people, support, and write for the website, like my Blades of Steel article, Cheap Plug, Cheap Plug.
7755977	7757618	Which was a very lovely article, actually.
7758158	7758658	Check that out.
7758698	7760139	It's on the website, orangelandradio.com.
7761491	7764452	Thank you so much for informing and making us laugh for seven great years.
7765192	7769873	Now that I have all that praise out of the way, I wanted to ask your guys' opinion on something.
7770694	7776175	Over the course of this next two weeks, I will be having a few get-togethers with about 25 of my friends.
7776655	7779816	We, of course, intend on having video games be the centerpiece of these parties.
7780336	7783457	I was wondering if you had any ideas or recommendations for great party games.
7783837	7785038	that we may want to try playing.
7785178	7792763	As it stands now, we have Gears of War 2, Team Fortress 2, various Wii Party games, Street Fighter 4, Left 4 Dead, and of course Rock Band 2 and Guitar Hero World Tour.
7793383	7797986	Your input would be most helpful, and once again, thank you, thank you, thank you for seven years of great radio.
7798266	7799827	Your super Hebrew pally, SSJ100Matt.
7803478	7804999	Well, you mentioned the Wii Party games.
7805039	7807779	I was actually going to say there's the Mario Party games are pretty fun.
7809680	7811641	I think you've named about what I would have named.
7811781	7813401	Oh, Marvel Ultimate Alliance.
7813901	7815622	Get your four player on.
7815782	7817622	Instant Party just add Rock Band.
7817662	7818422	It's so true.
7818782	7820283	Seeing it is actually pretty fun.
7820723	7826465	But, you know, if you kids are kind of worn out on that stuff, go back to the old school stuff.
7826545	7828526	Seriously, whip out Super Mario Bros.
7829047	7828526	3.
7829787	7832168	You can get a party around the old school games, too.
7832208	7832468	Oh, no.
7832768	7834449	Hook up a Dreamcast, Power Stone 2.
7836030	7837671	It depends on the type of audience.
7837691	7838951	Did he say it was other gamers?
7839031	7841593	Yeah, he said the games were to be the centerpiece.
7841693	7848276	Is it other gamers or is it just random kids our age?
7848696	7849596	You know what?
7849756	7853458	This is what I like to do sometimes because we've had parties like that before.
7854098	7862682	If you want to see certain stuff go on, say, hey, bring the system and bring your favorite group game and we'll switch out through them.
7863823	7864763	What's the problem with that?
7866862	7875656	I guess that's true yeah it's like a like a potluck a potluck for video games that's actually a really good idea a potluck of video games bring your favorite game I like that
7876613	7877754	So that's the last one.
7877974	7882739	Thank you, SSJ100Matt, for your kind words.
7883039	7885741	Hey, I opened up that file that Amisti sent us.
7885801	7889665	Oh my gosh, I don't even know where to begin with these clips.
7889705	7892527	There's like a million freaking clips in this thing.
7892968	7898533	I'm just going to pick just a couple of these random files and play them just because I'm curious and we're in kind of a fucking mood tonight.
7899233	7901315	Let's see, this file is called Into Lesbians.
7901355	7902036	Let's see what this one is.
7902356	7904998	If, like, if Twin was a girl, then his girlfriend would want to date him.
7905158	7905719	Anyway!
7905879	7906659	She's a lesbian, right?
7906699	7907320	Anyway!
7908841	7909802	I don't even know where these are from.
7910142	7911423	Let's try one of these longer files.
7911443	7914085	Let's see, this one says, OMG, gonna break your own ban.
7914605	7915886	La la la, going to the mailbag.
7915926	7917307	Oh, I need mailbag music.
7917907	7918688	Let's open up the mailbag.
7918728	7919068	Email.
7919308	7919949	There might be more.
7919969	7922171	We'll have to play one Jenny Rom song just because it fits.
7923291	7925213	Oh, we're gonna play, oh, we're gonna play, uh... Email Me.
7925533	7927414	Email Me is not Jenny Rom, that's, uh, Paul Terry.
7927434	7928075	Why is it not Jenny Rom?
7928115	7928535	I meant Paul Terry.
7928555	7929156	You meant Blonde Girl.
7930492	7931393	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7952256	7952596	Lord.
7952676	7953597	I want to see what this is.
7953997	7955578	God, Surge tastes like shit.
7955658	7957119	Okay, important message.
7957479	7963383	Okay, if you don't like Surge, you can drink that Pepsi Blue shit.
7963563	7965464	Remember how god-awful Surge was?
7965584	7966405	It was awesome!
7966485	7967546	I love Surge!
7967566	7968446	What the hell?
7968706	7969407	It was terrible.
7969587	7970687	Pepsi Blue?
7971068	7971768	It was all about Storm.
7971788	7971888	What? !
7978266	7979006	I've tried Storm.
7979026	7979867	I didn't like Storm.
7979907	7980787	Surge was awesome, though.
7980827	7983328	We had a vending machine at QZAR.
7983748	7986249	All that was in it was Surge, and I loved that stuff.
7986509	7986929	Whatever.
7990010	7991711	I'm very sad that it's gone now.
7991991	7994152	I'm looking at some of these other long clips here.
7994712	7996432	Rob with candy full.
7996492	7997273	What the hell is this?
7997673	8000014	Speaking of turdy things, though, guess what happened?
8000694	8002855	Itagaki got sued for sexual harassment.
8003235	8006976	A 31-year-old employee of Tecmo... Shouldn't that have been Speaking of Candy?
8008195	8011117	The compensation she is looking for... Rob...
8037245	8041588	Anyway, she's seeking compensation in 10 million... Rob, what the hell?
8043289	8044170	It's candy, get it?
8045131	8046752	This candy is not so delicious.
8048913	8049994	Wow.
8050074	8051115	Let's see, one more here.
8051235	8052736	Offensive things you've missed.
8052776	8053697	I like the word offensive.
8054537	8056178	She's literally sent like a ton of clips.
8057519	8060642	We could just sit here and play these all night long and we'd have like a whole show full of stuff.
8060962	8062483	Let me do this and we'll do some more video game stories.
8062503	8063964	Let's see, offensive things you've missed.
8064224	8068366	Some of you guys may be thinking, well, didn't you guys used to do the rewinds on your own damn station, Sky?
8069026	8075390	Yeah, actually, that's true, but now it is the oldie and moldie Wednesday flashback, where we are 100 episodes behind right now.
8075430	8077190	So you can hear what the show sounded like two years ago.
8077751	8078411	It's pretty nuts.
8079732	8088396	I kind of looked at the chat and some of the response to last week's episode, and I think Misty or somebody had said, it's a good thing I wasn't there, because I would have ripped them a new asshole.
8090148	8095990	So hear what offensive things you missed out on back on episodes 20 and 21 and all that stuff we're playing way back when.
8096010	8096970	So check it out.
8097110	8098811	I think that was on our old station.
8098851	8101251	We used to play shows that were like three years old.
8102052	8102792	I don't even know.
8102992	8107533	We lost a ton of shows when one of our hard drives went out, which is a bummer.
8107973	8109094	They might still be around.
8109114	8110554	Do you know who added me on Twitter the other day?
8110574	8111394	It was DDR Angel.
8111414	8115996	And if anybody has old OLR episodes, between her and Misty, we could probably find them all.
8117011	8118052	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
8137850	8143854	Yes, apparently there is a brand new game entering the wrestling game genre.
8144514	8150959	And this is being put out by Immersion Software on the Wii, PSP, and DS.
8151519	8156682	Oh, I'm sorry, that's by a different Argentine developer, Sabasa Studios.
8157303	8159804	But anyways, Immersion Software, they're putting it out on the 360 and PS3.
8160045	8161906	It is a Lucha Libre game.
8161926	8162086	Woohoo!
8162546	8164027	Lucha Libre Stars Psycho Clown
8189719	8191560	Who doesn't like a psycho clown?
8191700	8194322	Oh, and they have a teaser trailer up, which I haven't seen yet.
8194502	8197283	That looks awesome.
8200025	8204787	As long as they have... What was it?
8206028	8206508	Santos.
8207569	8208289	He's gotta be in there.
8210751	8213612	I don't follow this crap, so that's why I'm quiet right now.
8214273	8215733	This makes no sense to me, but okay.
8215993	8216734	You boys have your fun.
8218755	8219876	It's Mexican wrestlers.
8219916	8220697	It'll be awesome.
8223639	8224399	Hey, I'm not doubting you.
8224419	8224900	I'm just saying.
8224940	8226601	I'm not a fan.
8227362	8229863	Well, I'm not a fan of it either, but it's Mexican wrestlers.
8229903	8236608	I mean, hell, they have, what is it, the Santos line of videos.
8236688	8240191	It's a Mexican wrestler who's solving mysteries and stuff like that.
8240211	8242152	I mean, that's just cheesy and weird.
8243373	8243774	You know what?
8243894	8246055	You want to know a Mexican wrestler that was badass?
8246075	8248037	Did you ever play Saturday Night Slam Masters?
8248764	8250386	El Stingray El Stingray
8271829	8272149	Skybit Skybit
8287952	8290194	Are there any of the big stories we haven't got to yet, Loki?
8318015	8319797	You know, might not be exactly June 30th.
8320517	8322719	But that's kind of cool.
8322859	8323400	It was very cool.
8325001	8328284	Let me cover a couple quick stories here real quick before we go to the Skype line.
8329345	8329666	Let's see.
8329826	8334430	Archon is coming to the iPhone, which makes me very happy because I remember this game from the Commodore 64.
8334490	8338614	I think it actually did just come out because my friend was showing me that he bought it the other day.
8339434	8343078	It is out for $4 for the iPhone and the iPod Touch.
8343618	8344639	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
8365757	8367460	Well, I've got a few more stories here real quick.
8367500	8367700	Sure.
8368722	8373008	There's a rumor that 1v100 is coming out of beta next week and will actually be giving prizes.
8373609	8375171	So that would be cool.
8376653	8377655	I bet that's not true.
8378979	8380140	Bit.Trip Core 100th WiiWare Game 100th WiiWare Game
8396769	8398571	Namco Networks BurgerTime Deluxe
8416348	8417628	Yes, I heard about this.
8418009	8429832	I've heard a lot of people call it crap, but BurgerTime was an awesome game in the 80s, but even I can admit it's probably one of those things that's better left in the 80s, but I will check this out.
8430272	8435654	It just looks like the old game was souped up graphics and new stages, which it's not like the stages are that complicated.
8435934	8439736	Yeah, it's probably... And then finally, last thing... Oh, actually, I got two things.
8440377	8443338	Bethesda, their parent company bought id Software.
8443879	8448822	So now that's kind of under the whole... Zenimax, I guess, was the company that owns Bethesda.
8448902	8450823	Now they own id Software as well.
8451343	8461229	And apparently the next two games, Rage and Wolfenstein, obviously, are going to be published under their respective publishers, EA and Activision.
8462050	8462130	Um...
8463154	8467456	But now all the further games are being published under probably like Bethesda or something like that.
8467476	8467956	I don't know.
8468517	8472138	Zenimax, unless Zenimax has come out as a new publisher, I guess.
8473879	8484324	Apparently if you were a subscriber to EGM, and since EGM is kind of gone right now, your subscriptions were converted into Maxim subscriptions, which I think is a fair trade if you ask me.
8486305	8487146	So that's kind of neat.
8488226	8494911	and then still yet another survey suggesting that Netflix streaming is coming to the Wii.
8494931	8497313	We get this damn survey like every six months.
8497473	8501776	The only difference now is instead of a one-time fee of $9.99, it will be free.
8502336	8505259	So you will not have to purchase a streaming disc, but eh.
8505879	8506800	If it happens, it happens.
8506920	8507180	Cool.
8507920	8509001	And then finally, Ubisoft.
8509021	8512804	That would make the Wii a little more lucrative than 360 because you wouldn't have to have gold.
8513444	8513864	Very true.
8514045	8516986	That's a big feather in Wii's cap.
8517407	8518608	Don't underestimate that.
8519388	8520689	Don't underestimate that.
8520709	8522050	You can't do HD streaming, though.
8523851	8524371	You know what?
8524471	8529355	Considering the type of stuff that's there, I'm just going to say don't underestimate that.
8530552	8533274	I'm very critical of the Wii on this show, but that could be big.
8533874	8536216	Free Netflix, essentially, if you already have a Netflix account.
8536236	8540679	Rob, how long does it take for the internet browser to load up in the Wii?
8540939	8546523	You know what, if they can figure out the connectivity that makes games like Super Smash Bros.
8546563	8553708	and stuff work for kids programming and non-HD type stuff, again, don't underestimate it, Matt.
8554408	8560352	And then finally, Ubisoft's collaboration with Q Entertainment, it's likely to be a music game.
8561355	8564023	But, I mean, really, when you look at it... Ah, it's Q Entertainment.
8564043	8564945	Yeah, exactly.
8565387	8567934	I mean, unless it's 99 Nights 2, which I somehow doubt.
8569514	8595846	Alright, look, our skyline's already ringing off the hook And I really want to get to that very soon But one other quick story for you guys, if I could Marvel vs. Capcom 2 Big rumors out there that the game was coming out June 29th Not true, per the Twitters Official Capcom Twitter is not coming out June 29th They don't know where the rumor came from Well, let me tell you, it was from Marvel's financial report So you might want to look at that But they're saying now it's closer to the end of July That the game will actually come out So sorry if you guys were looking forward to that one
8596586	8597707	But it's not coming out this month.
8597727	8601389	That makes sense, though, because I think, wasn't it part of the Summer of Arcade or something like that?
8601449	8603470	And that doesn't start until, like, the end of July anyways.
8604250	8604850	Yeah, I don't know.
8605231	8606731	Alright, look, our phone is ringing off the hook.
8606751	8608852	Let's get some calls done tonight.
8608912	8609813	Hi, you're on Orange Dance Radio.
8609833	8610153	Who's this?
8611294	8614355	Saying that, it calls in almost every single week from the East Coast.
8614375	8616416	I don't know how you get through every time, but I'll tell you what.
8616857	8620218	I've seen, like, seven different names pop up in the corners, so you're lucky tonight.
8620238	8620739	What's on your mind?
8621659	8622179	Not much.
8622339	8623320	First off, I want to say...
8624093	8625353	Happy anniversary to you guys.
8625433	8626193	Happy birthday.
8626233	8627094	Congratulations.
8627254	8627654	Thank you.
8627794	8631294	We're seven, so we should be having this anniversary show at Chuck E. Cheese.
8632314	8633635	Yes, but you're still immature.
8634895	8635935	As a seven-year-old should be.
8637215	8638115	What's on your mind tonight, buddy?
8638916	8641296	I have a question about E3.
8643196	8648757	Before you guys went, you had made a statement about how you felt E3 wasn't going to be the same.
8648797	8652918	You had different feelings and intake about it before you went.
8654482	8656584	Did you feel the same way when you went or what?
8657024	8665371	Are you talking about the show itself or what I was kind of lamenting about that nobody I knew was really going so it was going to be a little weird this year?
8666280	8668042	A little bit of column A and a little bit of column B
8685638	8694344	But I think whatever they did to kind of filter out some of the people that didn't really need to be there, and one might argue maybe I don't need to be there, but I would argue right back, mofo.
8695084	8701689	But I would say whatever they did to kind of scale back attendance by whatever they did from 2006 was a good thing.
8701729	8703890	I think the show itself was good.
8704351	8709234	I do want to see them reopen Kensha Hall at some point, get some more exhibitors out there on the main floor.
8710455	8715058	And again, all that stuff that's behind closed doors kind of bugs me sometimes.
8715558	8717400	But whatever, it's just something we're going to have to deal with.
8717440	8718942	I think overall the show itself was better.
8720724	8726190	As far as the whole me lamenting about my friends not going and all that stuff, I think a lot of that got better.
8726230	8729574	I got to go to a pretty bitchin' party on Wednesday night that was hosted by...
8730455	8731656	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
8758536	8758896	I don't know.
8759076	8761878	It was kind of cool that one day Loki was there and we got to go around.
8763780	8769484	At night, at least, I had my boyfriend there that I kind of got to see at night, so it didn't end up being so bad in that regard.
8769884	8774807	I think I would have had even more fun and I would be more excited and woo, and I would have gone all three days.
8775128	8776729	Keep that in mind because that's a big thing too.
8776749	8777910	I didn't go all three days this year.
8778650	8779090	Oh, okay.
8800037	8803258	If you want to go to E3, but you can't, just go to PAX.
8803859	8806760	And Bobby's made this comparison before, and I think he's absolutely right.
8807081	8810042	PAX is probably what you think E3 is.
8811143	8811763	So go to PAX.
8814005	8814965	I'll be there at PAX.
8815145	8816326	East Coast PAX, that is.
8816426	8817687	I want to be at East Coast PAX.
8817727	8819988	I'm trying, but I've got to make West Coast PAX work, too.
8820849	8823250	Skip West Coast PAX and come to East Coast PAX.
8823470	8825871	If I can have Ken and Ice Cream, I'm doing both, all right?
8829039	8829380	DarkSakura.com
8842435	8843256	Take a train.
8843336	8843676	Take a train.
8866843	8867203	or Train.
8867243	8867583	There you go.
8867943	8870404	It's not really all that far to Boston.
8870464	8872245	Besides, I want to fly JetBlue to New York City.
8872285	8872765	I'm sorry.
8872805	8875306	If we can give them the option between Southwest or JetBlue.
8875826	8876206	JetBlue.
8877166	8879787	And I've heard lots of amazing things about Virgin Air.
8879827	8881548	That's the airline I want to try at some point.
8882008	8883588	Yeah, a lot of my friends fly Virgin Air.
8883608	8884409	They just love it.
8884689	8885849	I've heard great things about it.
8885869	8886969	They had a huge float today too.
8887290	8889830	Alright, hey Ranma, we've got to wrap up and let you go, but any quick final thoughts?
8891951	8892411	That's it.
8892511	8893211	That's pretty much it.
8893552	8893852	Later.
8894552	8894752	Later.
8896664	8899547	SSJ100 Matt says, flying to New York and I'll drive you to Boston.
8899887	8900828	That's a very nice offer.
8900848	8903071	That might be a good way to see some of the East Coast too.
8903131	8903431	I don't know.
8903731	8904872	It's so far off, you guys.
8904932	8905533	I'll figure it out.
8905573	8905893	Don't worry.
8905953	8906874	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
8906914	8907235	Who's this?
8907255	8911779	Hola, bienvenidos a Orange Lounge Radio.
8911839	8912160	Quien es?
8914568	8917770	Again, always call Echo 123 before you give us a call.
8918471	8923574	It's a good way to test your microphone, make sure everything is working just fine before you give us a ring.
8924095	8926416	We're going to open up the Skype line, take some more calls.
8926456	8927437	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
8927457	8927817	Who's this?
8929058	8930719	Hi, this is Gold Answell.
8930759	8933341	First of all, I want to wish you guys a happy 7th anniversary.
8933381	8934562	Well, thank you very much.
8934642	8936083	We're potty trained and everything now.
8938169	8944413	Yeah, I just, I wanted to agree on the past thing that Ranma said.
8944854	8959444	Yeah, I mean, I want you to come to PAX East because me and Robocoon, my friend that joined us for OR tonight, he's my friend and frequent podcast listener, he was saying, you know, I want to meet Rob Roberts because that would be the coolest thing ever because I've been...
8959895	8962319	Me and him have actually been listening to your show for a couple years.
8962699	8967706	You probably know that about me and not him, but I think I was the one that told them.
8968067	8970751	And we're just like, wow, wouldn't it just be cool to meet Rob Ross?
8970791	8974697	Even though they're not, like, big, but on the internet, it's just stuff that would be so cool.
8975083	8976724	I understand life skates and the life of parents.
8999474	9004200	Wish, wish, hope, hope that maybe some of my podcast buddies will be going out there too, so we can do something.
9004401	9004981	I might be.
9005042	9014054	If I can get a part-time job, I'm about 17 now, if I can find myself a part-time job, get myself a ticket, I will make every effort to be there, especially if you're there, but...
9014654	9016515	That's just how things go.
9016595	9019977	I just want to go to Boston, so I'm going to make packs.
9020538	9027242	Especially considering everything we talked about in Part A this week, and you only live once and all that stuff, I want to visit Boston.
9027282	9028422	It's the city I wanted to go to.
9028462	9032325	I know a lot of great people from there I want to go visit, so I'm there.
9033265	9034266	I'll make it happen one way or another.
9035199	9035499	DarkSakura.com
9053168	9053889	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
9076045	9089128	I really do appreciate you going into the current news sometimes because really I listen to OLR for the randomness that can pop up along with the mixture of the gaming news and you're not afraid to just have fun sometimes so I just wanted to let you know that.
9089668	9099030	Well, thank you very much and certainly this is always an evolving show and if our listeners want us to get back into doing more of the personal stories, then personal stories you shall have.
9100086	9100626	So, alright.
9101267	9102228	Well, we're going to let you go then.
9102488	9103549	I'll let you go.
9103809	9104029	Okay.
9104309	9105450	Thank you so much for the call, buddy.
9105710	9106130	Take care.
9106331	9107231	Have fun in your podcast.
9107291	9107531	Later.
9107551	9108432	Have a nice show, guys.
9108872	9110874	Later, dude.
9110894	9112815	1-877-GAME-OLR is the place to call.
9113556	9114496	Let's try going back to the phones.
9114537	9115397	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
9115417	9115757	Who's this?
9116498	9117158	It's GS68.
9117299	9118059	Hi.
9118099	9118740	What's on your mind, buddy?
9119885	9123208	I came back from the Philippines and wanted to share my arcade side of the things.
9123449	9124650	You came back from where, I'm sorry?
9125130	9125751	The Philippines.
9126171	9127592	Oh, the Philippines, that's right.
9127693	9131096	I think I saw something on your Facebook about you were going out there.
9131216	9134919	Believe it or not, I actually read the status updates on Facebook and Twitter and all that stuff.
9135600	9136140	How was it?
9137181	9139904	It was alright, though.
9139944	9141866	The arcades here weren't as good as last time.
9142106	9143167	Maybe not as good as I expected.
9144617	9145298	Well, you know what?
9145338	9148959	It's because the arcades over here probably aren't as good as you remember either.
9149760	9154602	They still have some games that I haven't seen on this side of the Pacific Rim years.
9157223	9162105	Like, for example, Mario Kart Arcade GP with card slots.
9162706	9166167	But what really surprised me when I was there was House of the Dead EX.
9167588	9168528	Hmm, how was that?
9169509	9170169	Basically, it's...
9171434	9181998	It's just a bit of a House of the Dead, but they drew it in a cartoony style, and you probably won't believe what I'm about to say, but basically the storyline of the game is a zombie romance.
9183599	9184539	That sounds awesome.
9184919	9186039	Zombie romance movie.
9186079	9187480	Now that's a movie that we need.
9187780	9188740	Who wouldn't go see that movie?
9188760	9197824	It's about this zombie girl who falls in love with her prison guard or whatever, and they escape, and you have to...
9199432	9209360	And it's basically a bunch of minigames where you have to do things like catch fruit or shoot the bad teeth off of the stage 1 boss of House of the Dead 4.
9209500	9216245	I thought for a minute there you were about to get into lesbian zombie romance because that was the only way this story was going to get even that much better, but that's okay.
9216325	9217346	Unfortunately, no.
9217666	9219027	They can do that in the sequel, that's alright.
9220988	9223110	And it's going through a phase and I...
9224090	9230954	Well, as I mentioned, I saw some games that I haven't seen in years, like F-Zero AX, and... Oh, I love F-Zero AX.
9231255	9233876	I gotta ask you real quick, though, real quick, since we don't have a whole lot of time tonight.
9233896	9234697	What about music games?
9234717	9236058	Because I know you're a big music game fan.
9236138	9238039	Is there a big presence of music games in the Philippines?
9242082	9242342	Hello?
9242702	9245284	Is there a big presence of music games over in the Philippines?
9248106	9248286	I lost...
9250956	9253878	I think we are losing GS68's connection.
9253958	9256219	I don't know if that's on your end or our end.
9256739	9257960	I'm going to have to let you go.
9258040	9258720	I'm sorry.
9258820	9263482	I don't know what happened with that connection, but we'll hope maybe he'll call back later when the connection is a little better.
9263842	9265103	In the meantime, let me get to another call.
9265383	9266324	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
9266344	9266684	Who's this?
9266964	9267304	Hello.
9267604	9267904	Hi.
9268045	9268385	Who's this?
9269192	9270152	This is Leachim6.
9270432	9271573	Hello, Leachim6.
9271753	9272773	I don't recognize that name.
9272813	9273733	Are you a first-time caller?
9274713	9275193	Yes, I am.
9275774	9276474	Well, welcome.
9276494	9277634	What a heck of a night to call.
9278234	9279375	Well, what's on your mind, buddy?
9280155	9281235	Hey, I was wondering.
9281355	9285296	I know you guys have addressed iPhone gaming and that sort of thing a little bit.
9285936	9291437	But, you know, with the new 3.0 update, you can add new devices to it, like controllers and stuff.
9292258	9292958	Have you guys seen that?
9294218	9294758	I've seen this one.
9294838	9296599	It's like a NES controller, but it's wireless.
9296619	9297239	It's like the GameBoom.
9297759	9300160	Yeah, you know, we were hearing about some of this stuff last week.
9300300	9305922	I think there was a story that we kind of got into a little bit about, like, especially about some of the things that are going to be developing for it.
9306183	9308604	But I wasn't under the impression that this crap was already out.
9308664	9309664	You can already get this stuff.
9310202	9310842	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
9332249	9347341	and that seemed kind of stupid but the thing about it is they don't really have a standardized controller yet so you buy this controller but you have to wait for people to actually support this controller in their games but I have a question so it's a wireless bluetooth controller, right?
9347681	9351884	that looks like a NES controller doesn't a lot of people already have one?
9351904	9359070	it's called a Wiimote I guess those do run off bluetooth, don't they?
9359090	9360651	because people have hooked them up to their computers
9360936	9368080	Yes, so you could, in theory, use a Wii Remote or Wii Classic Controller or something like that with that.
9368480	9380106	If that's okay with Apple, if they can support something like that, or if they don't need to get approved with that, if they just support it in whatever game is coming out.
9381246	9382086	I would think anything.
9382126	9383987	Well, you probably won't see that.
9384007	9384408	Here's my question.
9384428	9389931	This other thing you're talking about, that whole device, the bone or the game bone, is that an Apple official thing?
9390131	9390231	No.
9390291	9391491	Or is that some third-party company?
9391511	9391952	Third-party.
9392152	9392612	Interesting.
9393252	9397575	So that is interesting that that would come out, but see, Apple's so locked down with that kind of stuff.
9397635	9402877	I bet it's just a matter of time before someone hacks the phone to read that type of thing.
9403017	9404498	I'm surprised it hasn't happened yet.
9404758	9408300	I mean, the iPhone's been out for two or three years now, and we've had Bluetooth the whole time.
9408340	9409601	I'm surprised it hasn't happened yet.
9409781	9411462	Maybe no one sees the point.
9412162	9416164	Because, you know, you can't really use a Wiimote on the iPhone with such a tiny little screen.
9416504	9419145	That's the part that people are missing.
9419565	9420746	I don't want to use motion control.
9420806	9422826	I just want to use it as a NES controller for my NES emulator.
9423627	9424187	That makes sense.
9425227	9426908	I'm kind of surprised that hasn't happened.
9427328	9429969	I think it's just because sometimes those iPhones are like Fort Knox to get into.
9430430	9433291	I mean, not that that's ever going to stop the hackers, right?
9433311	9437152	Because how many times do they come out and say, This is unhackable!
9437292	9438113	And then two days later, they're hacked.
9438133	9438533	Yeah, I know, right?
9439884	9444908	It just seems kind of pointless to me to have a NES emulator where my fingers cover the screen when I play.
9445469	9452795	Well, now, sir, the legality of those NES emulators are a little questionable in the first place, so beggars cannot be choosers, my friend.
9453275	9457299	Well, obviously, I'm using games that I ripped from my cartridges that I bought when I was seven.
9457599	9458520	Of course, of course.
9459681	9464505	You know, I'm sure it's a matter of time before the Wiimote thing is hacked, but, you know...
9465822	9469583	I don't know if iPhone's really that big of a gaming platform for me.
9469763	9472825	iPhone is where I game when I'm sitting in the doctor's office waiting to be called in.
9474445	9478347	I think you addressed that last week, actually, about how you're not really a portable gamer.
9478807	9480187	Yeah, but maybe that's just me.
9481488	9482948	All right, well, hey, thanks so much for the call.
9482968	9484729	Any other quick things you wanted to say before we let you go?
9486009	9486310	Not really.
9486350	9488190	Just love you guys, and congratulations on seven years.
9488390	9490871	Well, thank you very much, and you picked a hell of a first night to call in.
9490911	9491331	You take care.
9492452	9492852	Later, guys.
9494355	9495336	That was a very nice phone call.
9519708	9523470	Let's go to at least one more call here and then we'll wrap up the show in a moment.
9524431	9527793	You picked the best last call to end the night off with.
9528193	9529554	And who am I speaking to?
9529874	9530895	Hello, Legend of Zaku.
9530915	9531655	What's on your mind?
9532956	9533516	Nothing much.
9533617	9541701	Just trying to get through all the grief of what was last week and unfortunately earlier today.
9541781	9544543	But I guess we've got to move on to bigger, better things.
9545744	9549026	Basically, the reason I'm calling today is just to
9550267	9562569	Bring up the fact that Id and Bethesda merged, which kind of surprised me because I never thought that John Carmack would actually sell out to any particular person.
9563169	9573091	Aside from EA, which he's actually working with, but not to a company like Bethesda, the folks from Fallout, or Elder Scrolls.
9573111	9577232	I'm not saying that they're all bad and all, but I don't know, it kind of came out of nowhere.
9579381	9589826	Um, yeah, I mean, yeah, we didn't really get into that on the show, but I guess that was a pretty big deal about, you know, ID and Bethesda kind of having their marriage going on there, but, um, uh, I don't know, like...
9591514	9598081	Maybe I'm just not as big of a first-person shooter fan that I've been following ID all this time, but I know Bethesda makes some very pretty games.
9598521	9601544	So certainly the two of them coming together is going to be very interesting.
9601604	9602104	But you know what?
9602144	9604247	When push comes to shove, money talks.
9604627	9615177	And you may have thought that so-and-so was not going to be selling out, but when you've got bills to pay and you've got somebody who's buying this... As long as it still maintains some sort of creative control.
9615217	9615778	In other words, if...
9617360	9631541	as long as Bethesda is not pulling their chain to the point of choking them out creative wise that would probably make sense as long as they mutually respect each other on that level then they could easily be and everybody wins
9632711	9657069	Bethesda makes pretty decent games though I mean like obviously you know Oblivion is huge, Fallout's huge I mean Elder Scrolls is pretty much their bread and butter that's what pretty much put them on the map right and but let's not forget Bethesda not every game they put out has been a huge success the Star Trek game that they did was not you know it's kind of mixed but at least it wasn't terrible you know mixed is better than terrible so their track record's pretty good overall so you know
9658653	9668056	Even though it might be something you didn't imagine before, it's not like it's completely unreasonable that ID would go to a fairly respectable company like Bethesda.
9669016	9687242	Yeah, as I said, it's all about whether or not John Carmack felt like it was something that he should have agreed with, something that I just hope he has confidence in his decision, or at least it itself is confident in the decision to merge with Bethesda.
9688625	9697993	But aside from that, yeah, I can't actually end off the call without making a notable mention of Michael Jackson's contribution to video games.
9698413	9714487	I mean, aside from Moonwalker, the fact that he contributed to Sonic 3, Space Channel 5, I don't know, I guess we could never really know of how much success this man has because he's pretty much proven himself
9715066	9722668	God knows how many times, on all fronts, not only on the stage or on the recording studio, but in our consoles.
9724288	9728709	Well, you know, Michael Jackson certainly was involved with Sega.
9728789	9736951	He had a lot of love for Sega, and I think we would all roll over if they would just put out a Moonwalker 2, but sadly it is just not meant to be.
9737971	9739872	Well, I just hope, you know...
9740848	9742429	The Legal Mess is just the tip of the iceberg
9763297	9769321	And I also want to clarify, it's not that Michael Jackson's Moonwalker was really that great of a game.
9769341	9771623	Well, the arcade version, obviously.
9772043	9773624	Genesis was kind of alright.
9773965	9776506	It was a freaking video game made out of smooth criminal.
9776626	9777767	That's what was cool about it.
9777967	9785833	But at least he made everybody dance, whether it be criminals, robots, or even vicious guard dogs dance when he did his magic dance.
9787199	9789180	You can't ignore that.
9789260	9796422	Even if you hate music, which I don't know anyone that says I hate all music, you can't ignore the contributions that Michael Jackson made to gaming.
9796942	9800943	I would buy it again just on the fact that he can make the dogs dance.
9801944	9802864	We're going to let you go, buddy.
9803104	9803924	Thanks so much for the call.
9804484	9805004	One more thing.
9805465	9806585	Happy anniversary, guys.
9806625	9808826	I know I forgot to mention that.
9809766	9810946	Seven more years, hopefully.
9812027	9812507	We'll see.
9812567	9812847	I don't know.
9812867	9814127	I'd be 38 at that point.
9815328	9815868	Take care, buddy.
9816567	9816847	Bye!
9837657	9838158	Spacemichael
9847901	9848161	Yeah.
9848201	9848441	Huge.
9848682	9851384	Well, he had a bigger part in Space Shuttle 5 too.
9851524	9853105	There was the whole dance scene.
9853465	9854166	That was pretty cool.
9854526	9854726	Yeah.
9854806	9856368	You know, good times, good times.
9856848	9857108	All right.
9857168	9861091	Well, gosh, it's about time for us to wrap up and get the hell on out of here for the night.
9861852	9865695	But before we do that, we have to go around and get everybody's final thought.
9866295	9868076	And I think, do we get all the last minute stories out of the way?
9868097	9869858	I think we covered everything we were going to cover tonight, right?
9869978	9870478	Pretty sure.
9870799	9871039	All right.
9871319	9872860	Then let's go around and get everybody's final thought.
9873160	9874601	DarkSagra, why don't you start us off tonight?
9874642	9875182	Your final thought.
9875442	9877944	Seiken Densetsu 3 is a freaking epic RPG.
9878824	9880706	They really need to give that an official release already.
9880786	9881586	Just put it on WiiWare.
9882067	9882427	For real.
9882627	9882907	Really.
9883408	9889972	My final thought is I really need to finish the Rydia after years because the new episodes come out like in a week.
9890613	9892754	Yeah, just over a week and I'm not ready for them yet.
9892774	9893935	I need to finish where I'm at right now.
9894315	9895456	So, yep.
9896597	9897737	Loki, your final thought tonight?
9898318	9902721	My final thought is that I need to play more Fuel.
9904980	9907022	Yes you do, I need to kick your butt at Fuel.
9907582	9908803	Be fun.
9909644	9914388	Actually, we need to go exploring for Vista Points, although I guess it's not really a cooperative type of game.
9914648	9916790	Pretty tough to play that co-op.
9917651	9918932	That's it guys, we're out of here.
9918992	9922455	We are going to close up, and as we have said for the past seven years,
9922995	9925677	Thank you guys for tuning in to Orange Lounge Radio.
9925737	9927258	It's your support that keeps us going.
9927819	9930081	And let's see if we can make it to eight.
9930181	9930981	I'm pretty sure we will.
9931662	9936165	Thank you guys so much for tuning in to us and listening to the show tonight, whether it be live, whether it be on the podcast.
9936205	9937326	We really appreciate your support.
9937686	9948935	Remember, if you like what you hear, all we ask, tell two other people about the show, your friends, your enemies, your coworkers, your fellow classmates in school, whatever, just as long as they can handle it because it's a mature audience show.
9950296	9953118	Tell two people about the show and spread the word because word of mouth is all we got.
9953418	9954959	Thank you guys so much for seven years.
9955759	9957420	We'll try our best to do seven more.
9958021	9959041	We'll see if we can make it.
