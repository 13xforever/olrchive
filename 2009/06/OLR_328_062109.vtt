00:07.000 --> 00:14.000
Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Sky, and Wotu

00:14.000 --> 00:20.000
Tonight, June 21, 2009, will you have to pay a premium price for DJ Hero and Band Hero?

00:20.000 --> 00:23.000
Could the BSP be getting its own app store?

00:23.000 --> 00:27.000
And is Activision really going to stop supporting Sony?

00:27.000 --> 00:31.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:31.000 --> 00:36.000
Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio

00:36.000 --> 00:43.000
We are that show dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle

00:43.000 --> 00:48.000
And it's always the three of us here with you every week to lead you through the week's topics

00:48.000 --> 00:51.000
But of course you guys play an important role in the show too

00:51.000 --> 00:53.000
So I'm going to introduce you guys first tonight

00:53.000 --> 00:59.000
The chatters, chat.orangelaungeradio.com, the emailers, mailbag orangelaungeradio.com

00:59.000 --> 01:03.000
And the tweeters, or the twitters, or the twit heads, I don't know what you'd call them

01:03.000 --> 01:08.000
At twitter.com slash o-l-r, and of course the Skype 877 game o-l-r

01:08.000 --> 01:10.000
All the different ways to interact with the show

01:10.000 --> 01:15.000
And then of course the three of us guiding you along, talking about the topics for the next few hours

01:15.000 --> 01:19.000
My name is Rob Roberts, joining us as always, the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers

01:19.000 --> 01:20.000
Yo

01:20.000 --> 01:21.000
How are you doing?

01:21.000 --> 01:22.000
Well, sort of

01:22.000 --> 01:23.000
Well, sort of

01:23.000 --> 01:25.000
Well, yeah

01:25.000 --> 01:26.000
Well, yeah, alright

01:26.000 --> 01:28.000
And playing Sims 3 again, that's two in a row

01:28.000 --> 01:30.000
Well, yeah, but I'm only doing it in the background

01:30.000 --> 01:31.000
No, that's alright

01:31.000 --> 01:33.000
How is Sims life going?

01:33.000 --> 01:40.000
Um, well, for some reason, okay, there's a very small chance of getting knocked up with just plain old woohoo

01:40.000 --> 01:42.000
As in, fucking

01:42.000 --> 01:44.000
And it always seems to happen to mine

01:44.000 --> 01:47.000
Whoopee, like they used to say on the Newlywed Game Show

01:47.000 --> 01:48.000
Rob

01:48.000 --> 01:49.000
What?

01:49.000 --> 01:50.000
It's fucking

01:50.000 --> 01:52.000
Don't you remember the old Newlywed Game Show?

01:52.000 --> 01:54.000
You know, where's the strangest place you've ever had Whoopee?

01:54.000 --> 01:56.000
In the butt, Bob

01:56.000 --> 01:58.000
Alright

01:58.000 --> 02:00.000
Also joining us

02:00.000 --> 02:03.000
And I don't want to know the strangest place he's ever had Whoopee

02:03.000 --> 02:04.000
God

02:04.000 --> 02:05.000
The wife's into porn

02:05.000 --> 02:07.000
Say hello to Techmaster Loki

02:07.000 --> 02:08.000
Hello

02:08.000 --> 02:09.000
How are you doing, Loki?

02:09.000 --> 02:10.000
Doing good

02:10.000 --> 02:11.000
Alright

02:11.000 --> 02:13.000
I don't know what else to ask you

02:13.000 --> 02:15.000
Alright, anyhow

02:15.000 --> 02:18.000
Let's, um, I guess start off the show as we always do

02:18.000 --> 02:20.000
With a little bit of How Was Your Gaming Week?

02:20.000 --> 02:23.000
And of course we'll get into the week's news and your telephone calls throughout the show

02:23.000 --> 02:25.000
And your witty chat comments

02:25.000 --> 02:27.000
From our chat room, chat.orangelandrater.com

02:27.000 --> 02:30.000
But, of course we always start it off with How Was Your Gaming Week?

02:30.000 --> 02:32.000
I probably don't have to ask StarSakura what she's been playing

02:32.000 --> 02:34.000
I can take a pretty good guess, but

02:34.000 --> 02:35.000
Does she want to surprise me?

02:35.000 --> 02:38.000
Well, I played Peggle on iPhone

02:38.000 --> 02:39.000
Okay, that's different

02:39.000 --> 02:41.000
And it was pretty fun

02:41.000 --> 02:45.000
I just played it once and got to the third level, I guess

02:45.000 --> 02:47.000
So it was pretty fun, I love those types of games, though

02:47.000 --> 02:49.000
And, of course, playing Sims 3

02:49.000 --> 02:51.000
Which is pretty cool

02:51.000 --> 02:53.000
Okay, people in the modding community

02:53.000 --> 02:56.000
Hurry up and fix their damn faces

02:56.000 --> 02:58.000
And fix the damn hair

02:58.000 --> 03:00.000
I'll give you a dollar

03:00.000 --> 03:02.000
Start now

03:02.000 --> 03:04.000
Um

03:04.000 --> 03:06.000
And, uh

03:06.000 --> 03:08.000
I played, um

03:10.000 --> 03:12.000
I played Black Knight 2000

03:12.000 --> 03:13.000
The pinball game?

03:13.000 --> 03:14.000
The pinball game

03:14.000 --> 03:16.000
I can hear pinball noises, by the way

03:16.000 --> 03:18.000
We just got to Lord of the Rings

03:18.000 --> 03:20.000
Got rid of Creature from the Black Lagoon, finally

03:20.000 --> 03:22.000
I liked Creature from the Black Lagoon, but whatever

03:22.000 --> 03:24.000
Machine was a bitch

03:24.000 --> 03:26.000
That's right

03:26.000 --> 03:28.000
It seems like it would be a bitch to maintain

03:28.000 --> 03:30.000
Isn't it like the thing where there's a top level and then there's a see-through underneath that?

03:30.000 --> 03:32.000
It's just like a hologram

03:32.000 --> 03:34.000
And you can just change out the hologram

03:34.000 --> 03:36.000
But, um

03:36.000 --> 03:38.000
But really, Dan really wanted Lord of the Rings

03:38.000 --> 03:40.000
So he said he'd get rid of Creature from Lord of the Rings

03:40.000 --> 03:41.000
And the opportunity came up

03:41.000 --> 03:42.000
And he's out there playing it right now

03:42.000 --> 03:44.000
He's been playing it

03:44.000 --> 03:46.000
Practically every piece of dialogue coming out of that game now

03:46.000 --> 03:48.000
Very nice

03:48.000 --> 03:50.000
And, um

03:50.000 --> 03:52.000
I've been playing a lot of

03:52.000 --> 03:54.000
Solitaire

03:54.000 --> 03:56.000
And I downloaded a bunch of games from my new netbook

03:56.000 --> 03:58.000
I put Linux Mint on it

03:58.000 --> 04:00.000
So I've been exploring the gaming in Linux

04:00.000 --> 04:02.000
And, um

04:02.000 --> 04:04.000
Actually, they've got a bunch of

04:04.000 --> 04:06.000
game packages just available

04:06.000 --> 04:08.000
to select

04:08.000 --> 04:10.000
Playing one called Cap Man

04:10.000 --> 04:12.000
Which is Pac Man

04:12.000 --> 04:14.000
And Sudoku

04:14.000 --> 04:16.000
And some of the little stuff

04:16.000 --> 04:18.000
They have a version of Lode Runner

04:18.000 --> 04:20.000
They have all kinds of neat stuff

04:20.000 --> 04:22.000
As soon as I find Kix, I'll be happy

04:22.000 --> 04:24.000
And you've been enjoying your Linux Mint, I know

04:24.000 --> 04:26.000
You've been talking about installing it on one of your computers for months now

04:26.000 --> 04:28.000
I was gonna do it on the old one

04:28.000 --> 04:30.000
But every time it happened

04:30.000 --> 04:32.000
Something would go wrong

04:32.000 --> 04:34.000
The CD had a scratch

04:34.000 --> 04:36.000
Or some crap

04:36.000 --> 04:38.000
And so, um, I finally just said

04:38.000 --> 04:40.000
Fuck it

04:40.000 --> 04:42.000
And, um

04:42.000 --> 04:44.000
Completely got rid of

04:44.000 --> 04:46.000
XP

04:46.000 --> 04:48.000
Because I hated all the crap that Dell put on it

04:48.000 --> 04:50.000
And just like, you know what, I'm gonna

04:50.000 --> 04:52.000
Go completely Linux on it

04:52.000 --> 04:54.000
And I don't regret it at all

04:54.000 --> 04:56.000
I love having multiple desktops

04:56.000 --> 04:58.000
Especially on such a small screen

04:58.000 --> 05:00.000
And it's been pretty cool, I like it

05:00.000 --> 05:02.000
Alright

05:02.000 --> 05:04.000
Alright, well, um, sounds like you've actually been pretty busy

05:04.000 --> 05:06.000
With games that weren't The Sims

05:06.000 --> 05:08.000
I'm actually kind of surprised

05:08.000 --> 05:10.000
But then also plenty of Sims 3, I'm sure

05:10.000 --> 05:12.000
Well, yeah

05:12.000 --> 05:14.000
They're making out right now

05:14.000 --> 05:16.000
They're making out right now? I was gonna ask you to

05:16.000 --> 05:18.000
Update the listeners on what's going on in their Sim world right now

05:18.000 --> 05:20.000
Well, actually, I started over with the same couple

05:20.000 --> 05:24.000
Because I got tired of them having nothing but girls

05:24.000 --> 05:26.000
They seriously had nothing but girls

05:26.000 --> 05:28.000
So, um, I started over

05:28.000 --> 05:30.000
Alright

05:30.000 --> 05:32.000
I started over and I'm, uh

05:32.000 --> 05:34.000
Just hoping for a boy

05:34.000 --> 05:36.000
Well, no, they've got a boy now

05:36.000 --> 05:38.000
Oh, they do now

05:38.000 --> 05:40.000
If they have a girl now, I don't care

05:40.000 --> 05:42.000
Alright, let's move on

05:42.000 --> 05:44.000
Loki, how was your gaming week?

05:44.000 --> 05:46.000
Um, it was alright, didn't play much

05:46.000 --> 05:48.000
I played Grand Theft Auto 4 still

05:48.000 --> 05:50.000
And then I also played

05:50.000 --> 05:52.000
Saints Row 2 when, um, you know

05:52.000 --> 05:54.000
Obviously the live was down on Tuesday

05:54.000 --> 05:56.000
For a brief moment

05:56.000 --> 05:58.000
So, um

05:58.000 --> 06:00.000
Well, actually, all day

06:00.000 --> 06:02.000
But, um, that meant we had to play something that

06:02.000 --> 06:04.000
Would allow us to play System Link

06:04.000 --> 06:06.000
And Saints Row 2 would be that game

06:06.000 --> 06:08.000
And I kicked the crap out of everybody

06:08.000 --> 06:10.000
In Saints Row 2 really bad

06:10.000 --> 06:12.000
Um, I did go back, though

06:12.000 --> 06:14.000
And play some more Saints Row 2

06:14.000 --> 06:16.000
With the actual, um

06:16.000 --> 06:18.000
I guess download expansions that were

06:18.000 --> 06:20.000
Available for it

06:20.000 --> 06:22.000
There's only two real paid expansions

06:22.000 --> 06:24.000
So I had already downloaded both of those

06:24.000 --> 06:26.000
And they're okay

06:26.000 --> 06:28.000
Um

06:28.000 --> 06:30.000
There's one escort mission I have to do

06:30.000 --> 06:32.000
For escorting some

06:32.000 --> 06:34.000
I have to guard these trucks

06:34.000 --> 06:36.000
They're picking up nuclear waste

06:36.000 --> 06:38.000
And, unfortunately, they're really retarded

06:38.000 --> 06:40.000
And they keep, you know

06:40.000 --> 06:42.000
The cops just spawn

06:42.000 --> 06:44.000
Out of nowhere and just crash

06:44.000 --> 06:46.000
Straight into the front of the truck and just

06:46.000 --> 06:48.000
Kind of sit there for a while and

06:48.000 --> 06:50.000
Does constant damage to it, so

06:50.000 --> 06:52.000
I have had to repeat the mission about eight times

06:52.000 --> 06:54.000
And I still haven't passed it yet

06:54.000 --> 06:56.000
And it's really annoying, so

06:56.000 --> 06:58.000
I hate escort missions

06:58.000 --> 07:00.000
All the time, because the AI's really annoying

07:00.000 --> 07:02.000
And then the rest of the missions

07:02.000 --> 07:04.000
Are just kind of what you'd normally expect

07:04.000 --> 07:06.000
In the game, so

07:06.000 --> 07:08.000
Apparently these are the last two, um

07:08.000 --> 07:10.000
Actual things that they're adding on there

07:10.000 --> 07:12.000
So

07:12.000 --> 07:14.000
Oh well

07:14.000 --> 07:16.000
I guess I'm done with Saints Row 2

07:16.000 --> 07:18.000
Um, but then Grand Theft Auto 4

07:18.000 --> 07:20.000
I'm looking to mod it some more

07:20.000 --> 07:22.000
And I've been just waiting to get my computer set up

07:22.000 --> 07:24.000
Which I did today

07:24.000 --> 07:26.000
So hopefully later this week I'll be able to, uh

07:26.000 --> 07:28.000
Tweak it some more

07:28.000 --> 07:30.000
Alright

07:30.000 --> 07:32.000
How's the house going, by the way?

07:32.000 --> 07:34.000
I know we talked a little bit about your new house last week

07:34.000 --> 07:36.000
But now we get settled in a little more, probably

07:36.000 --> 07:38.000
Yeah, still unpacking, got the internet and cable

07:38.000 --> 07:40.000
Hooked up and everything, so

07:40.000 --> 07:42.000
Still unpacking and

07:42.000 --> 07:44.000
Trying to get things cleaned up

07:44.000 --> 07:46.000
My mom and my

07:46.000 --> 07:48.000
Grandparents came over yesterday

07:48.000 --> 07:50.000
They were helping with

07:50.000 --> 07:52.000
Just some of the stuff I needed to get done around the house

07:52.000 --> 07:54.000
You know, patching holes

07:54.000 --> 07:56.000
On the wall and painting

07:56.000 --> 07:58.000
Stuff and that kind of thing

07:58.000 --> 08:00.000
So, yeah, it's just

08:00.000 --> 08:02.000
A constant

08:02.000 --> 08:04.000
Project, I guess

08:04.000 --> 08:06.000
Alright

08:06.000 --> 08:08.000
Well, my gaming week, I feel like I'm back into

08:08.000 --> 08:10.000
A lot of regular gaming now

08:10.000 --> 08:12.000
Especially since I quit pretty much all my MMOs

08:12.000 --> 08:14.000
Believe it or not, I am playing no MMOs at this time

08:14.000 --> 08:16.000
This week was MMO free, 100%

08:16.000 --> 08:18.000
No WoW, no Final Fantasy 11, no nothing

08:18.000 --> 08:20.000
So it's a little weird

08:20.000 --> 08:22.000
Because I've been playing MMOs for so long

08:22.000 --> 08:24.000
But I am completely MMO free this week

08:24.000 --> 08:26.000
And once you know it, this would also be the first time

08:26.000 --> 08:28.000
In a long time that I could report on this program

08:28.000 --> 08:30.000
I actually played a game

08:30.000 --> 08:32.000
Through to completion

08:32.000 --> 08:34.000
I know, shock and awe, because I have this thing

08:34.000 --> 08:36.000
Called Gaming ADD

08:36.000 --> 08:38.000
Where I always jump from one game to another

08:38.000 --> 08:40.000
Spending $60 on one game, never finishing it

08:40.000 --> 08:42.000
And going to another, I'm sure plenty of you are like that

08:42.000 --> 08:44.000
Because a lot of games take a long time to beat

08:44.000 --> 08:46.000
But the game I beat

08:46.000 --> 08:48.000
Was Final Fantasy IV The After Years

08:48.000 --> 08:50.000
Although, I didn't really beat it

08:50.000 --> 08:52.000
I'm kind of getting to stretch

08:52.000 --> 08:54.000
The truth a little bit, because it is an episodic game

08:54.000 --> 08:56.000
You've completed this episode

08:56.000 --> 08:58.000
Yes, I've completed the main episode

08:58.000 --> 09:00.000
The Seador and Cain's Tale

09:00.000 --> 09:02.000
Which was

09:02.000 --> 09:04.000
You know, I talked about this game a little bit

09:04.000 --> 09:06.000
On last week's show

09:06.000 --> 09:08.000
Again, it's total trip down nostalgia lane

09:08.000 --> 09:10.000
I, though, now that I know more about the story

09:10.000 --> 09:12.000
I want to say two things about the story

09:12.000 --> 09:14.000
One, for a real fan of Final Fantasy IV

09:14.000 --> 09:16.000
The story is great

09:16.000 --> 09:18.000
I think it is a great

09:18.000 --> 09:20.000
Written sequel

09:20.000 --> 09:22.000
And that's just basing it off the main episode

09:22.000 --> 09:24.000
But even just reading what I've read about the upcoming episodes

09:24.000 --> 09:26.000
And so on

09:26.000 --> 09:28.000
I think this story is going to be great

09:28.000 --> 09:30.000
And real fan service to fans of the original

09:30.000 --> 09:32.000
But the second thing I want to say about the story is

09:32.000 --> 09:34.000
If you haven't played the original, don't bother with this game

09:34.000 --> 09:36.000
It will not make sense to you

09:36.000 --> 09:38.000
There is so much that references the original

09:38.000 --> 09:40.000
Final Fantasy IV

09:40.000 --> 09:42.000
Or II, if you want to go back to

09:42.000 --> 09:44.000
American numbers

09:44.000 --> 09:46.000
There's so much that references that old story

09:46.000 --> 09:48.000
You will not understand it as much if you didn't play it

09:48.000 --> 09:50.000
Is there a fat Chocobo?

09:50.000 --> 09:52.000
Not that I've run into yet

09:52.000 --> 09:54.000
But apparently they're there

09:54.000 --> 09:56.000
If you want to go out of your way to visit Chocobo forest

09:56.000 --> 09:58.000
In the main story

09:58.000 --> 10:00.000
But the way they have built this game

10:00.000 --> 10:02.000
Since it is episodic content

10:02.000 --> 10:04.000
They have made it a bit more linear

10:04.000 --> 10:06.000
And restricted as to where you can go

10:06.000 --> 10:08.000
But they do it in a way where that doesn't seem obvious

10:08.000 --> 10:10.000
But they definitely restrict

10:10.000 --> 10:12.000
You know how

10:12.000 --> 10:14.000
Even the old Final Fantasy games did this

10:14.000 --> 10:16.000
Think about the very first Final Fantasy game

10:16.000 --> 10:18.000
You were on foot

10:18.000 --> 10:20.000
But then you get a raft

10:20.000 --> 10:22.000
That will take you around in the water

10:22.000 --> 10:24.000
Then you get a ship that will take you around

10:24.000 --> 10:26.000
Anywhere in the water

10:26.000 --> 10:28.000
In deeper water

10:28.000 --> 10:30.000
Then you get the airship that will take you anywhere

10:30.000 --> 10:32.000
And then in Final Fantasy IV you go underground

10:32.000 --> 10:34.000
But the airship can't fly over lava

10:34.000 --> 10:36.000
So then you get the uberaireship that can fly over lava

10:36.000 --> 10:38.000
So you know, they have ways of restricting

10:38.000 --> 10:40.000
Where you can go

10:40.000 --> 10:42.000
And they definitely do that in this game

10:42.000 --> 10:45.720
the original game, you gotta have this game. I know it's taking a lot of crap for the fact

10:45.720 --> 10:49.840
that it is episodic and that they are charging, you know, three dollars every episode means

10:49.840 --> 10:53.480
the game's gonna cost, you know, probably like thirty bucks for all the parts. But you

10:53.480 --> 10:59.000
know what? I try to also value my game on how much time I'm getting out of it and how

10:59.000 --> 11:04.560
much, you know, reward I'm getting from the investment. And honestly, if these three bucks

11:04.560 --> 11:11.740
a pop are going to be three hours, four hours worth a pop of good story and entertainment

11:11.740 --> 11:17.920
for me, then it's worth it. But, you know, this game isn't for everyone. I think a lot

11:17.920 --> 11:22.640
of people would be driven bonkers by the amount of random monster encounters and the fact

11:22.640 --> 11:26.760
that you do have to do a little bit of grinding if you want to get anywhere in the game. I

11:26.760 --> 11:30.400
think that's not for everybody, but I think for fans of the old school Super Nintendo

11:30.400 --> 11:35.880
RPGs, you've got to check this out. It's great. Let's see, other games I've been playing this

11:35.880 --> 11:39.680
week. Speaking of old school role playing games, I was playing Phantasy Star 2 for a

11:39.680 --> 11:42.240
good chunk of time this week, right? Well, here's the thing.

11:42.240 --> 11:43.440
Dude, I have that game.

11:43.440 --> 11:47.600
Okay, you know Trixie360 on Twitter, right? Trixie, she's great.

11:47.600 --> 11:49.440
She just had her baby too. Congratulations.

11:49.440 --> 11:53.200
She did. Congratulations Trixie. You just had baby Trixie this week. She just spawned

11:53.200 --> 11:54.200
this week.

11:54.200 --> 11:55.440
Yes, she has spawned.

11:55.440 --> 12:00.740
But yeah, she was giving away codes and, you know, I just happened to be on Twitter one

12:00.740 --> 12:05.680
night when she was giving them away and I was like, okay, my Google FU skills are awesome.

12:05.680 --> 12:09.160
These little trivia questions she's asking about the 90s, I can do this. I can do this.

12:09.160 --> 12:12.640
I do this for the online games I play all the time that don't relate to video games

12:12.640 --> 12:17.760
with like some of the role play I do. I can Google FU faster than anyone and sure enough,

12:17.760 --> 12:21.440
the second time she gave away a code that I was watching, I won a code for Phantasy

12:21.440 --> 12:27.880
Star 2, which in retrospect seems a little useless because I do have the Sonic Genesis

12:27.880 --> 12:33.320
collection but I, you know, I wanted to see did this game offer anything different and

12:33.320 --> 12:39.320
the answer is not really, except achievements are in it for what it's worth. I haven't gotten

12:39.320 --> 12:43.440
any yet because I, you have to get to level 10 to get the first one. I only played, you

12:43.440 --> 12:46.640
want to talk about a game, an old school game where you have to do a lot of freaking grinding.

12:46.640 --> 12:50.080
Okay, right from the start, you can't really go anywhere until you like grind your way

12:50.080 --> 12:52.120
to level like three or four right at the beginning.

12:52.120 --> 12:53.120
You just set off poor.

12:53.120 --> 12:56.160
Exactly. So, I mean, you want to talk about a game that's really brutal.

12:56.160 --> 12:59.800
But that game has, um, uh, what's-her-face in it, the cat girl.

12:59.800 --> 13:01.200
Yeah, I haven't gotten that far yet.

13:01.200 --> 13:03.040
I've actually, I've actually got a figure of her.

13:03.040 --> 13:05.520
Again, this is Phantasy Star 2 for those folks in chat who are-

13:05.520 --> 13:07.960
The one that turned out evil later.

13:07.960 --> 13:08.960
Well don't spoil, I'm just kidding.

13:08.960 --> 13:09.960
You don't have to spoil, okay.

13:09.960 --> 13:10.960
No, I know.

13:10.960 --> 13:14.980
Phantasy Star 2, if you haven't played it by now, you're probably not gonna.

13:14.980 --> 13:20.200
Not true because I never played it on the Genesis. But granted, there's so many, I could

13:20.200 --> 13:24.240
have gotten it on PlayStation 1 or, you know, any of the millions of times they've re-released

13:24.240 --> 13:27.200
this game. But for whatever reason, I'm just now playing it.

13:27.200 --> 13:30.400
She actually doesn't turn out evil. It's something else weird that happens to her.

13:30.400 --> 13:31.400
Ah, okay.

13:31.400 --> 13:32.400
So, well, it's not really-

13:32.400 --> 13:34.800
I'm sorry, I've barely been paying attention to the story.

13:34.800 --> 13:37.800
But if you want my little figurine, you can have it, because she's cute.

13:37.800 --> 13:38.800
Maybe.

13:38.800 --> 13:39.800
She's a cat girl.

13:39.800 --> 13:43.080
I've been having fun with it so far. I'll have to play a little more. There are leaderboards

13:43.080 --> 13:46.920
too, which is something a little extra you don't have in the Mega Genesis Collection.

13:46.920 --> 13:51.600
And also, the smoothing is in both, but the save system's a little different, but that's

13:51.600 --> 13:55.720
not really anything to hoop and holler about. You can save anywhere in the game though,

13:55.720 --> 13:59.600
and I don't remember, I didn't play it enough in the Mega Collection to know if that was

13:59.600 --> 14:03.360
the case. I think for anybody that owns a collection, there really probably isn't much

14:03.360 --> 14:07.160
point to having this game, unless you really want achievements, or you are just that much

14:07.160 --> 14:08.160
of a fan of the system.

14:08.160 --> 14:11.300
I kind of wonder why they decided to release that collection if they were playing to release

14:11.300 --> 14:15.720
these games. It would seem to me that it would be a good idea to release the games on Xbox

14:15.720 --> 14:19.560
Live Arcade first, suck in all the money that you can, then BOOM!

14:19.560 --> 14:20.920
And really piss us off.

14:20.920 --> 14:23.840
Hey, but who cares? It's a great deal now.

14:23.840 --> 14:27.160
You know what? For those that may not want all those games though, that maybe just want

14:27.160 --> 14:30.000
the role-playing games or what have you, it might be a decent alternative.

14:30.000 --> 14:33.280
No, you probably should still buy the game, because by the time you're actually going

14:33.280 --> 14:37.080
to purchase it, it'll probably be down to $20.

14:37.080 --> 14:40.480
Anyway, Phantasy Star II's alright. If you haven't played it one of the million other

14:40.480 --> 14:44.960
ways you can get that game, then it's worth checking out. It is a piece of gaming history

14:44.960 --> 14:47.800
known for its notoriety of being an incredibly difficult RPG.

14:47.800 --> 14:54.160
God, seriously though. I think it's actually one of the best Sega RPGs out.

14:54.160 --> 14:57.120
And that's why they've released it so many times.

14:57.120 --> 15:00.160
Make sure that people who want it can get it.

15:00.160 --> 15:04.440
Yeah. Okay, let's see. What else have I been playing this week? I've actually been playing

15:04.440 --> 15:08.240
a lot. Fuel is another game I've checked out. This is something that Loki was raving about

15:08.240 --> 15:12.240
on the show a couple weeks ago. I mentioned that I touched the game last week, but I hadn't

15:12.240 --> 15:16.800
really played a lot. I've spent a lot more time with Fuel this week, and you know, I

15:16.800 --> 15:19.800
think honestly you're going to have to file this game and love it or hate it. Because

15:19.800 --> 15:23.560
I've been trying to look at some of the mainstream reviews, which I don't usually do, but I've

15:23.560 --> 15:28.360
been trying to figure out why the game has not been scoring kind of better as a whole.

15:28.360 --> 15:33.040
Because I think there is a lot to this game. I think it's really just a love it or hate

15:33.040 --> 15:37.200
it type of game. There are some pretty in-your-face type of flaws with the game. Like there is

15:37.200 --> 15:41.160
some graphical clipping that is just like, oh my gosh, did I really just drive right

15:41.160 --> 15:45.800
through that tree? Did that really just happen? You know, there are some big flaws. I feel

15:45.800 --> 15:51.520
like this game was slightly rushed. Like if they just spent another couple months doing

15:51.520 --> 15:55.800
some quality testing, the game would be even that much better. But I do love the fact it

15:55.800 --> 16:00.880
is hugely expansive. There is so much world to see. Not that I think there's a lot of

16:00.880 --> 16:05.120
it that's particularly like memorable, but I think what's cool is that they've introduced

16:05.120 --> 16:12.720
these like Vista Points, which you know, there's so much you can collect. You can collect new

16:12.720 --> 16:17.060
images for your car, paint jobs for your car, called liveries, that are hidden throughout

16:17.060 --> 16:20.300
the world. You have to find them and run into them to collect them. And then they have these

16:20.300 --> 16:24.440
things called Vista Points, which are just basically like really pretty spots that you

16:24.440 --> 16:28.160
drive the car to. And they're very specific points and you can collect these as well.

16:28.160 --> 16:33.600
And they also have kind of like cops and robber chase things, where if you run into these

16:33.600 --> 16:38.640
cars then it will reveal the spots of all these challenges or all these liveries on

16:38.640 --> 16:43.440
your GPS. Or you can actually run into cars and get the car a little later on when you

16:43.440 --> 16:49.480
unlock the second area. You can do that. So it's kind of neat. You know, a lot for like

16:49.480 --> 16:54.000
somebody who likes to collect things in games. And I love, it's arcade style controls.

16:54.000 --> 16:56.680
Did you try driving from the first camp to the second camp?

16:56.680 --> 16:59.720
You know I have a funny story about that. Yes I did because I wanted to get that achievement

16:59.720 --> 17:02.880
because I looked at what achievements you had got and I figured well anything Loki has

17:02.880 --> 17:07.320
I can get. So I actually tried to get that achievement and the funny thing is I didn't

17:07.320 --> 17:12.780
finish it because I got fooled. As I was driving there and right when I crossed into that second

17:12.780 --> 17:16.900
zone it said, oh, achievement unlocked. And I was like, oh, well I guess I don't really

17:16.900 --> 17:19.560
have to drive all the way into the base camp. Well that's cool. That's easy. You just have

17:19.560 --> 17:24.040
to drive from the one map line to the other. Whoops. The achievement I found out later

17:24.040 --> 17:28.800
that I really got was the one for driving 100 miles cumulatively. I just happened to

17:28.800 --> 17:33.080
get it at that moment. And so now I'm going to have to go back and do it again.

17:33.080 --> 17:37.280
It's cool though because you drive through a forest fire while you're going there.

17:37.280 --> 17:40.800
That's where I actually unlocked it was during, you know, they have done some pretty imaginative

17:40.800 --> 17:43.940
things with the game. I just don't think it's for everyone. I think there's a lot of people

17:43.940 --> 17:47.560
that are going to pick this up and go, what the hell's the point? Like where, what am

17:47.560 --> 17:54.400
I doing? And it does, the game is not kind into kind of a ramp up learning curve. You

17:54.400 --> 17:59.280
just are kind of thrown into it. Okay, so what do I do? You're kind of like, do I drive

17:59.280 --> 18:05.240
around aimlessly? Do I go into a race? What the F am I supposed to be doing right now?

18:05.240 --> 18:08.880
And I think part of the, you know, love it or hate it nature of it is that you just kind

18:08.880 --> 18:12.700
of figure out whatever you want to do. You just do. Yeah. So that's kind of part of the

18:12.700 --> 18:17.680
interesting thing about it. Uh, it is available on Xbox live. Apparently there's a way that

18:17.680 --> 18:22.440
you can go into Xbox live and actually race in the open world with other racers, which

18:22.440 --> 18:25.800
kind of reminds me of test drive unlimited. However, when I turned this feature on, I

18:25.800 --> 18:29.520
didn't run into a single person, but I thought maybe this was because I was adventuring out

18:29.520 --> 18:33.240
in the middle of nowhere in the second world. So mate or second section of the map that

18:33.240 --> 18:36.600
you unlock. So maybe everybody's like in the first area, I don't know. Or maybe it was

18:36.600 --> 18:42.120
because I was playing it like 1am on Saturday. I don't know, but, uh, I didn't run into anybody,

18:42.120 --> 18:47.800
but I did try some of the Xbox live races and uh, yeah. You can make your own races

18:47.800 --> 18:51.880
too, which is kind of what I heard. I haven't played with that feature yet. I wanted to

18:51.880 --> 18:56.280
do it. I think it'd be fun to film racing from one corner of the map to the other corner

18:56.280 --> 19:01.440
of the map because that would take like 10 hours. I've heard it takes a long time to

19:01.440 --> 19:04.960
get because we did during lunch one day we said, okay, let's see how far we can get in

19:04.960 --> 19:09.440
a half an hour. And it was like hardly anything on the map. We got to a new area and that

19:09.440 --> 19:13.480
was it. You actually, you can get further faster if you're smart about the way you do

19:13.480 --> 19:18.200
it. If you drive on the freeways with a freeway vehicle, you'll go really fast. But if you

19:18.200 --> 19:22.280
try to just go from point A to B off road, like as the crow flies, you're not going to

19:22.280 --> 19:26.440
get there as fast. You really do have to take the freeways and the bullet car and go 110

19:26.440 --> 19:31.100
miles an hour to get places faster. It's just, you're so tempted. Like I just want to drive

19:31.100 --> 19:35.980
off road, you know, and I like that they've scattered the fuel barrel barrels around that

19:35.980 --> 19:39.840
you can just kind of run over and get points for it. So I've gotten most of my cars that

19:39.840 --> 19:45.560
way. Yeah. Yeah. Nice. So again, I think the game is kind of cool, but it's not for everyone.

19:45.560 --> 19:52.800
Like the game definitely has its flaws. Um, the, the single player races, some of it gets

19:52.800 --> 19:57.900
a little annoying, like some of the challenges that are just endurance, like it's a 15 minute

19:57.900 --> 20:02.440
race. I'm not even joking from one point to another. And then to like come in second on

20:02.440 --> 20:07.500
that 15 minute race and get nothing for it is a little frustrating. Like you don't get

20:07.500 --> 20:10.520
a silver medal or anything. It's like, Oh, you lose. Do you want to try again? Or the

20:10.520 --> 20:15.800
chasing the copter thing and you're just like, Oh, I took the wrong turn. Oh crap. Yeah.

20:15.800 --> 20:20.440
There are some areas like that where it's like, come on. I, that is like one big thing

20:20.440 --> 20:24.240
I would have fixed is I would have given some type of reward for second and third place

20:24.240 --> 20:30.880
or give me a reason to waste 15 minutes, you know? Yeah. So yeah. But otherwise, um, yeah,

20:30.880 --> 20:34.320
that game, there's a lot of collectible to it. I will play it again. I got to play the

20:34.320 --> 20:37.960
Loki online at some point. That'd be fun. We can have a race to drive from one point

20:37.960 --> 20:42.880
to another. It'd be fun. It would be cool. So we'll see. Um, gosh, I've talked a lot

20:42.880 --> 20:47.040
about games, but I just, I've had time to play them again. Thanks to, uh, not playing

20:47.040 --> 20:51.120
well. So there you go. I guess that's it. I, that's all I'm going to share for my gaming

20:51.120 --> 20:53.680
week. I know there's been some other stuff, but that's all I want to share. I want to

20:53.680 --> 20:59.520
actually get into some gaming news first, some housekeeping, believe it or not guys,

20:59.520 --> 21:06.560
Tuesday, which is, uh, yeah, two days from today, June 23rd marks the seven year anniversary

21:06.560 --> 21:12.440
of orange lounge radio. That's right. Our first show was June 23rd, 2002 believe it

21:12.440 --> 21:17.480
or not. So on Tuesday it will have been seven years since that very first episode. And that's

21:17.480 --> 21:22.320
with essentially no break. And when I say no break, granted, of course we've had a week

21:22.320 --> 21:26.920
off here and there for holidays or trips or travel or what have you. But honestly, there's

21:26.920 --> 21:32.440
never been a break longer than I think our longest downtime was three weeks once. And

21:32.440 --> 21:35.880
that was like a one time thing that happened, but we've been going like nonstop ever since

21:35.880 --> 21:39.200
I don't even think it was three weeks. I think it was two weeks when like we were moving

21:39.200 --> 21:43.440
out of one, like remember when Loki and I used to live together, we did the show there.

21:43.440 --> 21:47.040
I think when we moved from that to the new setup, I think that was our longest break

21:47.040 --> 21:52.080
we had because it was such a big move. So, but yeah, seven years of orange launch radio,

21:52.080 --> 21:57.360
believe it or not. When we started doing this show, I was just about to have my 24th birthday.

21:57.360 --> 22:02.200
I was 23 years old and now I'm going to be, it's funny enough, OLR started three days

22:02.200 --> 22:06.560
before my birthday. So now I'm turning 31 this week. That's a long time of doing this

22:06.560 --> 22:11.800
show, but yeah, I'm still going. You know what? It's better. Things get the best when

22:11.800 --> 22:16.320
you're in your thirties. That's what I say. That's right. So, okay. And we'll be actually

22:16.320 --> 22:19.880
having more of a celebration quote unquote next week, although we have nothing special

22:19.880 --> 22:23.520
planned. So, um, I don't know when you start to get a certain age, you kind of hope other

22:23.520 --> 22:27.560
people throw you a surprise party so you don't have to do any work. No, I'm kidding. I don't,

22:27.560 --> 22:33.800
I don't know what there is to do. Uh, so certainly we'll open up the Skype line to your calls

22:33.800 --> 22:38.200
about the show. Maybe share some favorite moments. Uh, some of you guys, I would love

22:38.200 --> 22:42.200
some of you guys that are archive experts at the show, dig up some of your favorite

22:42.200 --> 22:46.000
moments that are out there and available and we'll try to replay some of them next week

22:46.000 --> 22:52.200
if we can find any. So there you go. Seven years next week. Um, tiger claw points out

22:52.200 --> 22:56.200
and I have, I've been ignoring chat all night. I apologize. Tiger claw points out, uh, today

22:56.200 --> 23:01.440
is a holiday. We'll sort of, of course, father's day. So to all of our gaming dads out there

23:01.440 --> 23:06.700
today, uh, happy father's day to you or whatever father figure happens to be in your life.

23:06.700 --> 23:10.480
Maybe a grandpa or a brother, I don't know. So happy father's day to all of you fatherly

23:10.480 --> 23:15.380
figures out there. And as tiger class doesn't chat today as a holiday, we'll sort of happy

23:15.380 --> 23:20.740
about to be a father's day for Loki. This is, you know, the wife is preggers. Well,

23:20.740 --> 23:25.280
they celebrated it for me anyway. They got a shop vac, which is awesome. Oh, nice power

23:25.280 --> 23:31.360
tools. I need the shop vac like any good father should have. So there you go. All right, well,

23:31.360 --> 23:34.960
um, let's get into the show tonight. And for those that listened last week, which I hope

23:34.960 --> 23:39.640
you all did, it was on the podcast feed. Our podcast feeds been on time lately. Um, we

23:39.640 --> 23:44.360
have kind of changed the format of our show a little bit less stories, more time with

23:44.360 --> 23:48.600
each story, because, you know, you guys can go on and, you know, kind of get a rundown

23:48.600 --> 23:52.200
of the gaming news on hundreds of different websites, but this is one of the only places

23:52.200 --> 23:56.640
where you can really talk about them with other gamers who aren't jerks and leave comments

23:56.640 --> 24:02.280
that say first. So let's talk about this week, gaming news. There's been some big stories

24:02.280 --> 24:06.760
this week, especially huge one. Uh, dark soccer is going to start us off tonight with some

24:06.760 --> 24:10.120
game, uh, with some gaming news to talk about and your calls at eight seven, seven game

24:10.120 --> 24:16.400
OLR. Well, we have a case of, it could be a business decision or it could just be, um,

24:16.400 --> 24:21.900
a case of pissy bitchiness. I don't know. Activision's got some PMS going on, but they

24:21.900 --> 24:28.560
just say there might stop supporting Sony. Um, the saying that, um, actually their CEO,

24:28.560 --> 24:35.400
Bobby Kotick said that they would have to cut the price, um, because, uh, they wouldn't

24:35.400 --> 24:41.160
be able to, I guess, make the games, you know, that people would buy because the console's

24:41.160 --> 24:46.720
too expensive. You know, also, I think there's a certain amount of, uh, costs that goes into

24:46.720 --> 24:52.000
doing anything for Sony because they've got some pretty expensive rates. Um, they said

24:52.000 --> 24:58.800
that they might just have to stop, um, supporting Sony come 2010, 2011. Um, and they're also

24:58.800 --> 25:05.760
considering not just the PS3, but the PSP as well. Um, they pay 500 million in royalties

25:05.760 --> 25:15.080
to Sony, um, which is roughly about 40% of their profit. Um, so under those circumstances,

25:15.080 --> 25:19.520
you know, I kind of don't blame them. You know, if they're trying to really make back

25:19.520 --> 25:25.160
their money, their Xbox, honestly, Xbox and Wii is going to be where it's at for Activision,

25:25.160 --> 25:31.720
I would think. Uh, Loki, you agree? I don't, I don't happen. I don't know. Well, I don't

25:31.720 --> 25:36.480
know if I totally agree with the whole, it's only there on Xbox and Wii, but I, I get it.

25:36.480 --> 25:41.000
I get that sentiment, but I do think you have your hardcore Sony audience that would justify

25:41.000 --> 25:45.720
the cost of porting the game. Bobby Kotick has been bitching about the Sony PS3 price

25:45.720 --> 25:50.920
for a long time now. Every time you hear about some, you know, Activision's bitching about

25:50.920 --> 25:54.800
the price of the PS3, they think it's too high. They think there should be a price drop.

25:54.800 --> 25:59.000
They're hoping there's a price drop. They're always complaining about the PS3 price, and

25:59.000 --> 26:03.320
you know what? They still sell, they don't sell as many units on the PS3 as they do on

26:03.320 --> 26:08.160
the 360, but they still sell quite a bit. And I'm sorry, but you're going to just cost

26:08.160 --> 26:13.960
average everything across the board, you know, for most of the games that you develop. So,

26:13.960 --> 26:18.080
you know, hey, if you don't want to develop for the PS3, then don't. But I think, you

26:18.080 --> 26:24.280
know, franchises like, you know, Modern Warfare 2 and, you know, Guitar Hero and stuff, the

26:24.280 --> 26:30.560
PS3 is still a very integral part of, you know, those franchises. And to just get rid

26:30.560 --> 26:36.440
of it because, oh, it's too expensive, well, that's not really good reason. Although, let's

26:36.440 --> 26:41.320
just say if they are crazy enough and they actually go through with it, that's going

26:41.320 --> 26:45.680
to suck for Sony. And that's going to be something I don't know if they can be able to make up

26:45.680 --> 26:53.680
ground on. Empty threats? Probably. What do you guys think? 1877 Game OLR or a username

26:53.680 --> 26:59.080
on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio and I'm reading the chat room here. Rama says, good for Activision.

26:59.080 --> 27:06.640
Now from what I heard or remember reading, EA, I guess, I don't know if maybe EA dropped

27:06.640 --> 27:13.240
or Sega, they weren't supporting the Genesis or something like that at one time. Like EA

27:13.240 --> 27:19.560
dropped them for similar reasons. I don't know, it'd be interesting. I don't think that's

27:19.560 --> 27:24.400
going to happen though. Because, I mean, all it would take is something like that to happen.

27:24.400 --> 27:34.400
Say Activision to stop publishing Guitar Hero on the PS3 and boom! Rock Band will come in,

27:34.400 --> 27:39.680
swoop up all those sales right there. And then, you know, Modern Warfare 2, I'm sure

27:39.680 --> 27:45.040
there's going to be another military shooter out there. If not first party, then someone

27:45.040 --> 27:52.320
else putting something out. I don't know, it's not going to just kill them for not having

27:52.320 --> 27:55.760
Activision. There's a couple listeners in chat that want to say it's the Dreamcast that

27:55.760 --> 28:01.760
EA dropped. Oh, Dreamcast, okay. Okay, that's what it was. I knew it was the Sega system

28:01.760 --> 28:07.040
but I couldn't remember which one. So yeah, I mean, I doubt that at this point they're

28:07.040 --> 28:12.400
going to do that. There is a response from Sony. Obviously this thing caught so much

28:12.400 --> 28:16.880
momentum around the internet that Sony had to make a response and they did. And the response

28:16.880 --> 28:20.880
goes something like this. PlayStation has tremendous momentum coming out of E3 and we

28:20.880 --> 28:25.200
are seeing positive growth with more than 350 titles slated to hit across all of our

28:25.200 --> 28:29.680
platforms including many anticipated games from our publishing partners. And this, by

28:29.680 --> 28:34.360
the way, this quote is from Patrick Siebold who is a spokesperson for PlayStation. We

28:34.360 --> 28:38.480
enjoy healthy business relationships with and greatly value our publishing partners

28:38.480 --> 28:42.560
and we are working closely with them to deliver the best entertainment experience. So in other

28:42.560 --> 28:46.800
words, they didn't really address the issue. They just kind of said, we still are awesome

28:46.800 --> 28:52.400
and we're just going to ignore this guy because he's a boob. Well, he may be a boob. I mean,

28:52.400 --> 29:01.400
who knows? He seems to whine a lot, I guess. It really doesn't matter if he thinks there

29:01.400 --> 29:04.680
should be a price drop. They shouldn't have to drop their price because he thinks there

29:04.680 --> 29:10.560
should be a price drop. Fuck him! He doesn't work for Sony. So, you know, whatever. I mean,

29:10.560 --> 29:14.560
they don't have to... I think it's going to be a bad business decision for them to drop

29:14.560 --> 29:19.160
the Sony platforms because, you know, that's millions of people that aren't going to be

29:19.160 --> 29:25.240
buying your product. And when, you know, a lot of games nowadays rely on both consoles.

29:25.240 --> 29:29.800
I mean, I know with like Grand Theft Auto even, you know, it wasn't exactly 50-50 for

29:29.800 --> 29:35.680
the console sales, but it wasn't too skewed one side or the other. I mean, that is a good

29:35.680 --> 29:41.680
portion of their sales. And I can imagine the same thing for, you know, Call of Duty

29:41.680 --> 29:45.960
and Guitar Hero and stuff like that. The PS3 sales have got to be a pretty significant

29:45.960 --> 29:51.120
part now. If their development costs are too high or licensing costs are too high across

29:51.120 --> 29:55.600
the board, then maybe that is something that Sony can go and fix. And I know that they

29:55.600 --> 29:59.880
have, as far as the PSP, they've kind of lowered the development cost for that as far as the

29:59.880 --> 30:03.440
debug units and that kind of thing. And I think that they're working on something similar

30:03.440 --> 30:07.700
to that with the PS3 as well. Maybe that might be something that they can look at as an option

30:07.700 --> 30:12.700
to, you know, save some money for the third-party publishers and give them a reason to develop

30:12.700 --> 30:16.840
more on the PS3. But, you know, it's not a reason to drop them. Here's a comment from

30:16.840 --> 30:20.160
Rama I find interesting in our chat room. chat.orensonshreda.com. And again, we are

30:20.160 --> 30:25.240
just, you know, inviting phone calls throughout the show. 1-877-GAME-OLR. Rama in chat says,

30:25.240 --> 30:29.440
it takes one company to stand up to Sony. If Activision drops support for PlayStation

30:29.440 --> 30:34.220
3, it's just a matter of time that other companies do as well. I don't know though, because didn't

30:34.220 --> 30:39.120
a few companies leave ESA, but not everybody did? You know, like, I don't think necessarily

30:39.120 --> 30:44.200
one in Activision was kind of, you know, that's one reason I almost would believe this guy

30:44.200 --> 30:50.280
if he's a boob or not is that Activision did drop ESA for a while, didn't they? At least,

30:50.280 --> 30:54.080
yeah. And Blizzard didn't even freaking go to E3 this year because they're like, we don't

30:54.080 --> 30:58.560
need to, basically. We got BlizzCon. We sell out those tickets, like, you know, we have

30:58.560 --> 31:03.560
to set up freaking queues on our website to handle the load and they're gone in 15 minutes.

31:03.560 --> 31:10.120
We don't need it. Like, so, you know, on one hand, despite the thought that, again, I'm

31:10.120 --> 31:13.860
kind of torn. I'm like, yeah, it sounds like an empty threat, but at the same time, track

31:13.860 --> 31:17.400
record shows Activision is willing to make good on these type of threats. You know what

31:17.400 --> 31:22.560
I mean? Well, he says you can have like a time frame. Oh, 2010, 2011. If it was like,

31:22.560 --> 31:27.920
if you do not drop your price by December 31st, 2009, we will be gone June, you know,

31:27.920 --> 31:32.080
first 2010. That's like a closed door conversation, though. You know what I mean? Yeah. Part of

31:32.080 --> 31:37.160
me wonders, though, is this much ado about nothing? Did this guy make an offhanded remark

31:37.160 --> 31:43.320
that just, you know, a sound bite, if you will, did this guy just make a careless remark

31:43.320 --> 31:49.120
that got picked up and ran with by the gaming press and overanalyzed by folks like ourselves?

31:49.120 --> 31:56.880
I kind of don't think so. Well, who? Kodak? He made it to the, to the Times. I guess that's

31:56.880 --> 32:02.360
true. And I think he was pretty clear on it, but the fact is, I mean, how many times have

32:02.360 --> 32:07.680
we been reporting on, you know, company heads making stupid comments about something and,

32:07.680 --> 32:13.720
you know, and the fallout from it? I mean, Sony is a perfect example of that, you know,

32:13.720 --> 32:22.680
and thank goodness they got rid of the cran eating guy, but, yeah, it's, I don't know.

32:22.680 --> 32:26.320
I don't think anything's really going to happen with this, and that's really kind of the issue.

32:26.320 --> 32:30.000
And yes, I think that they should drop the price of their system, but for entirely different

32:30.000 --> 32:35.160
reasons other than Activision says so. I mean, that's not the reason to drop the price of

32:35.160 --> 32:38.160
the system. There's some good debate going on in our chat room right now. Maybe that's

32:38.160 --> 32:42.560
why everybody's afraid to call in, which is fine. And also, I think we had a slight listener

32:42.560 --> 32:47.400
dip tonight. I don't know if everybody's aware, but we shifted a little bit on the radio stream.

32:47.400 --> 32:51.760
It is not right now on the front page of allgames.com. I guess they're doing some remodeling over

32:51.760 --> 32:57.240
there. I don't know. But we're on radio.allgames.com, and I think a few of folks may have not figured

32:57.240 --> 33:00.840
that out even though there's a big link at the top that says All Games Radio on allgames.com.

33:00.840 --> 33:05.560
I don't know. But, yeah, so, but we do have some chatters that are very active tonight,

33:05.560 --> 33:09.720
and Tigerclaw in chat says, the sad part about this, there are people out there who are willing

33:09.720 --> 33:15.000
to pay the premium to get a PlayStation 3. But Rama retorts with this, PS3 is not a premium

33:15.000 --> 33:19.760
console, neither is Xbox 360 or Wii. Sony won't price drop because they'll take a higher

33:19.760 --> 33:24.400
loss on each unit. Don't forget, Rob, Best Buy, GameStop, and other companies told Sony

33:24.400 --> 33:28.200
to drop the price of the PSP, or else they'd stop selling it.

33:28.200 --> 33:32.960
Hmm. That is a problem when the companies that are selling your product are saying they're

33:32.960 --> 33:37.000
going to drop you. I think more so than the publisher, because, to be honest, they could

33:37.000 --> 33:42.280
probably make it through without Activision, even though Activision right now is the number

33:42.280 --> 33:51.920
one publisher out there, only because EA dropped the number two. But, I don't know, it's not

33:51.920 --> 33:54.400
going to kill them if they go away.

33:54.400 --> 33:58.580
Let me read this comment as well from Bochikawa in our chatroom. It's a total bluff, but it

33:58.580 --> 34:02.880
still puts into people's mindset to stop dealing with Sony, and even then, I doubt they will

34:02.880 --> 34:07.080
stop dealing altogether, leaving ports or minor titles to them.

34:07.080 --> 34:11.000
Because think about it. Here's another thing. Think about it. Would you really want to ruin

34:11.000 --> 34:16.760
your relationship with Sony? Say, okay, we're going to stop supporting the PlayStation 3

34:16.760 --> 34:21.280
and the PSP. Okay, the PlayStation 4 comes out. Oh, you just burned your bridges with

34:21.280 --> 34:27.680
Sony because you're being a dick, and now you have the PS4 coming out, and you could

34:27.680 --> 34:30.920
have had some really good partnerships with them to get some good launch titles and that

34:30.920 --> 34:37.040
sort of thing. Oh, but you're a dick, so now they're going to, I don't know, maybe be so

34:37.040 --> 34:43.840
kind to you because you decided to drop them dead weight, and maybe possibly hurting the

34:43.840 --> 34:45.600
launch of your next system.

34:45.600 --> 34:50.080
You know, I don't know how I feel about the whole PlayStation 3 is not a premium console

34:50.080 --> 34:54.640
content. I don't know if I'd necessarily call it premium, but let's face it. The PlayStation

34:54.640 --> 34:59.840
3 does have one big component you cannot ignore that the Xbox 360 and the Wii doesn't have,

34:59.840 --> 35:04.360
and that's Blu-ray. You know, especially as we're getting into more high definition, and

35:04.360 --> 35:08.320
Blu-rays are starting to penetrate the market more and more. We're kind of where DVDs were,

35:08.320 --> 35:11.760
what, 12 years ago. You know, as Blu-rays are starting to penetrate the marketplace

35:11.760 --> 35:15.400
more and more. I don't think you can ignore the fact that the PlayStation 3 is the only

35:15.400 --> 35:19.600
one out there right now that's a Blu-ray player, and that's not something that I don't, despite

35:19.600 --> 35:24.640
all the rumors, Microsoft ain't even considering, and Nintendo sure as hell ain't considering

35:24.640 --> 35:26.680
this whole Blu-ray thing.

35:26.680 --> 35:31.840
So that's one thing that Sony's always going to have, making it, you know, a type of entertainment

35:31.840 --> 35:36.360
hub. Now, to be fair, of course Xbox has the whole Netflix thing, which has worked out

35:36.360 --> 35:41.560
very well for them. It's a completely alternative method of delivering movies that we might

35:41.560 --> 35:46.360
see getting bigger and bigger, and perhaps one day giving Blu-ray a run for its money.

35:46.360 --> 35:53.440
But in a lot of respects, I don't think it's there yet for the average consumer.

35:53.440 --> 35:58.840
Yeah, and for the average consumer, the PS3 is an awesome Blu-ray player. It does all

35:58.840 --> 36:03.600
the updating for them. They don't need to worry about, oh, will this disc play in my

36:03.600 --> 36:08.120
system? Because, you know, a lot of people out there that don't own a PS3 and just have

36:08.120 --> 36:11.440
a normal Blu-ray player, you need to have that thing connected to the internet, and

36:11.440 --> 36:16.920
to update your system, you know, to the updated firmware so that it can play, you know, whatever,

36:16.920 --> 36:23.760
you know, Blu-ray movie is out there, you know, there's a lot of burning off discs and

36:23.760 --> 36:27.960
different processes along with that, whereas the PS3 makes it very seamless with their

36:27.960 --> 36:34.380
firmware updates. So, you know, that is something we kind of don't, we kind of take for granted,

36:34.380 --> 36:38.200
but you know, it is a big thing, especially when you're looking at movies and you're thinking

36:38.200 --> 36:42.240
about getting into, you know, the Blu-ray market, and at the time, it was the cheapest

36:42.240 --> 36:46.960
Blu-ray player out there. Now, not so much anymore, but I got to think, you know, now

36:46.960 --> 36:52.240
that Blu-ray's been out there for at least a few years now, the price of the components

36:52.240 --> 36:57.280
have to have come down by now, and you know, they've got to find ways to cut costs, and

36:57.280 --> 37:01.520
you know, maybe putting out new systems with larger hard drives isn't the way to go. Maybe

37:01.520 --> 37:05.880
you should just, I don't know, keep the same hard drive size and start dropping the price,

37:05.880 --> 37:12.880
or drop something else, I don't know, make it cheaper. Yeah, let's see, a couple more

37:12.880 --> 37:17.760
comments from chat. Rama says, Loki, that's reminiscent of the whole Nintendo Square debacle

37:17.760 --> 37:25.600
years ago. Yeah, and Square's back. That's true, but you know, Nintendo did take a pretty

37:25.600 --> 37:33.120
big hit. You know, Final Fantasy, going over to the PlayStation, was huge. It was just

37:33.120 --> 37:39.440
absolutely huge. In some ways, maybe I'm just a little biased here because I happen to be

37:39.440 --> 37:45.280
a role-playing game fans, I think Nintendo 64 didn't do so hot, in part, because of that.

37:45.280 --> 37:50.280
Not really, but they did get Pokemon. I mean, it was the Nintendo franchise, but seriously,

37:50.280 --> 37:55.160
the Pokemon franchise. Oh, your sound is off. Is your mic on? No, it slid, sorry. Well,

37:55.160 --> 37:59.960
I was going to say, Nintendo did have, you know, Pokemon to keep them above, above water

37:59.960 --> 38:07.480
pretty much. I think that's what saved the Nintendo 64 as long as it did. Let's see,

38:07.480 --> 38:13.760
two Africans in our chat room says, simply, PlayStation 3 is a great system. On what planet?

38:13.760 --> 38:17.640
I don't know, I think it is a good system. It is a good system. It's a good Blu-ray player.

38:17.640 --> 38:22.440
Well, yeah, it's a good Blu-ray player. It's much quieter than the Xbox 360. I enjoy playing

38:22.440 --> 38:28.760
games on it. It's got the better controller than the 360. I disagree. I don't fault the

38:28.760 --> 38:33.160
PS3 as a bad system at all. I don't think it is a bad system. I think they just marketed

38:33.160 --> 38:38.600
it terribly. It was too expensive to begin with. If I hadn't gotten mine for free, you

38:38.600 --> 38:44.080
know, from a wonderful customer of mine, I probably wouldn't own one. Or at least not,

38:44.080 --> 38:48.280
it would have taken a long time before I owned one, because, you know, $400 for a system

38:48.280 --> 38:52.440
even now, I mean, it's a lot of money to drop on that. Let me go to the phones. We just

38:52.440 --> 38:57.240
got a call. Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this? Hi, yeah, this is Spazinator.

38:57.240 --> 39:02.000
Hi, Spazinator. What's on your mind about this whole PlayStation 3 debacle going on

39:02.000 --> 39:07.680
in Activision? Do you think they're going to make good on the threat? No, not at all.

39:07.680 --> 39:13.680
Well, there's a slight possibility, but the possibility of it is kind of, you know, somewhat

39:13.680 --> 39:20.360
like, you know, there's always a possibility that, you know, it could snow in, you know,

39:20.360 --> 39:27.000
southern Mexico, but it's very likely that it happens. Not likely, but you never know.

39:27.000 --> 39:34.640
Well, yeah, but I don't know if that's totally the same thing going on, but what about, like,

39:34.640 --> 39:38.720
I could ask the question, do you think Sony needs to drop the price of the console, but

39:38.720 --> 39:42.960
who's not going to say yes to that? But the question I'm going to ask is, do you think

39:42.960 --> 39:50.640
Sony has real, legitimate reason to drop the price of their console right now? Yes, you

39:50.640 --> 39:57.120
know, depends on how you want to look at it. I'm kind of on the fence on that subject.

39:57.120 --> 40:03.560
I can see why they're not tracking it, because, you know, mainly because of the Blu-ray drive

40:03.560 --> 40:08.560
itself, they're still kind of expensive to manufacture, and they're already taking a

40:08.560 --> 40:16.760
hit by, you know, selling at the price they're at, but at the same time, you know, at least

40:16.760 --> 40:24.200
for most consoles, I think, except for, like, the Wii and the PlayStation 2, generally speaking,

40:24.200 --> 40:30.000
console manufacturers always take a hit on, you know, consoles, and it's kind of like

40:30.000 --> 40:37.440
a stop-loss kind of thing, where they tend to make all their monies through the licensing

40:37.440 --> 40:43.600
fees on the games, right? I guess. I'm looking at a lot of chat comments, though, about the

40:43.600 --> 40:47.840
whole thing, and GameGuru says, I'd own a PlayStation 3 if it were $300 and was backwards

40:47.840 --> 40:53.000
compatible with PS2 games. That's a huge thing. That was so stupid of them to eliminate that

40:53.000 --> 40:56.720
as quick as they did. I guess they did it as a price-cutting thing, but they needed

40:56.720 --> 41:01.040
to find a way to do it somehow, I think, and Two Africans said the PlayStation 3 would

41:01.040 --> 41:05.120
have been more successful if Sony hadn't raped us in the ass with the price at launch. They

41:05.120 --> 41:09.540
don't get how to do it, and basically, even from launch, remember when we saw, when they

41:09.540 --> 41:12.280
were first talking about the PS3 and they were showing off the controller and stuff

41:12.280 --> 41:17.640
like that, and it's $600, and you were like, what? Are you stupid? Let me wrap up with

41:17.640 --> 41:22.560
Spaznator, though. Spaznator, do you think this is actually going to happen? Do you think

41:22.560 --> 41:25.360
Activision is actually going to pull out, or what?

41:25.360 --> 41:34.560
Probably not. I hope not. At least for the sake of those, they only own the PlayStation

41:34.560 --> 41:39.560
3. Otherwise, they're going to have to go shell out for a second console, whether it

41:39.560 --> 41:45.520
be Wii or 360. All right. Well, thank you very much, Spaznator, for your thoughts. Thank

41:45.520 --> 41:52.720
you so much for the call. Take care. I was going to say about, there's certain things,

41:52.720 --> 41:56.440
though, that we're kind of forgetting, too, is that PlayStation, you know, because I can't

41:56.440 --> 41:59.880
remember Spaznator is the one that plays Final Fantasy XI. It was him or one of the other

41:59.880 --> 42:03.600
listeners that plays Final Fantasy XI a lot. It made me think that Final Fantasy XIV is

42:03.600 --> 42:07.840
on its way to PlayStation 3. God, I know. And there are some exclusives out there on

42:07.840 --> 42:10.240
the horizon, but is it going to be...

42:10.240 --> 42:14.800
It's always, okay, here's the thing with Sony, and it's been this way ever since the launch

42:14.800 --> 42:19.800
of the PS3, and even the PSP. There's always been exclusives, and they've always been on

42:19.800 --> 42:24.320
the horizon, and they've always stayed on the horizon, until finally they decide, hey,

42:24.320 --> 42:28.840
okay, we're going to finally come out with this now. But price has always been an issue

42:28.840 --> 42:33.580
with the Sony platforms. Ever since the PS3 launched, the price has been too high. I don't

42:33.580 --> 42:37.640
care what kind of price drops they've been doing, it's still too damn high for it right

42:37.640 --> 42:44.340
now. And even with like the PSP, the PSP Go price, are they fucking crazy? Let's put it

42:44.340 --> 42:48.680
out for $250. Great, that's a perfect way not to sell any more consoles. That PSP Go

42:48.680 --> 42:55.680
is going to fail like crazy. But I don't know, I think it's just, they're really, they need

42:56.080 --> 43:00.440
to get smart, and they need to figure out a way to gain ground now, and yes, the exclusives

43:00.440 --> 43:03.240
will help, but price drop will help even more.

43:03.240 --> 43:09.400
If the PSP Go, I think, had a $99 price point on it like Dan had mentioned a while back,

43:09.400 --> 43:12.000
then I think they'd be selling like freaking hotcakes.

43:12.000 --> 43:12.900
I agree.

43:12.900 --> 43:19.900
And on top of that, looking at the construction of them about what they took out, the machines

43:19.920 --> 43:26.280
themselves can't really be relatively that expensive to produce, nor can shipping and

43:26.280 --> 43:31.120
marketing costs really be that much if they've already got some momentum going with it. So

43:31.120 --> 43:38.120
really, you know, say that to cost ship and market each individual system, it costs them

43:39.800 --> 43:45.800
say $80, put it out for $125, you'll make tons of profit still, because you'll get more

43:45.800 --> 43:50.080
units out, and the more you mass produce them, the cheaper they are to produce.

43:50.080 --> 43:53.440
Okay, we've got to move on with some more stories, and we will, but I want to say-

43:53.440 --> 43:58.820
I was saying, my point is, is that that's simple economics, simple business, and Sony

43:58.820 --> 44:04.860
should know that. If they want to get, you know, the games, if they want to keep some

44:04.860 --> 44:08.960
of their people, if they want to sell the systems, that's the way to do it.

44:08.960 --> 44:14.400
I think one place that Sony is losing to Microsoft, as much as I do enjoy my PlayStation 3, is

44:14.400 --> 44:19.160
that they are not staying current as fast as Microsoft does, and that is killing them

44:19.160 --> 44:23.800
this generation. Because Microsoft had a hard time doing that with the original Xbox, but

44:23.800 --> 44:29.040
right now, they built that 360 to get these upgrades and all these things fast. And you

44:29.040 --> 44:33.800
know, one thing that Microsoft's doing right right now, that I would say not even Nintendo's

44:33.800 --> 44:37.560
doing, but Nintendo doesn't need it because their audience is totally different right

44:37.560 --> 44:43.240
now, is that they are evolving so much faster. You know, with this whole thing like the NXC,

44:43.240 --> 44:47.160
Netflix on the 360, some of these other things that are coming out, you know, they are able

44:47.160 --> 44:51.840
to, with what they've got, the constraints they have with that machine, they're making

44:51.840 --> 44:56.480
it work a lot faster than Sony is. When was the last time you saw a major, major, major

44:56.480 --> 45:03.200
upgrade to the PlayStation outside of home? And some would argue home, you know, was not

45:03.200 --> 45:04.960
all it was cracked up to be. So I don't know.

45:04.960 --> 45:08.740
It's definitely not the big hub that they thought it would be. It's kind of a neat thing

45:08.740 --> 45:10.640
to play around with, but yeah.

45:10.640 --> 45:15.540
All right. Well, I'm sure this story is to be continued. It'll be interesting to see

45:15.540 --> 45:19.240
how long this whole little stalemate lasts.

45:19.240 --> 45:26.240
Yeah. Well, speaking of PlayStation, the PSP Go has an interesting rumor kind of related

45:27.640 --> 45:33.600
to it. Apparently there's a rumor that Sony is working on an app store for the PSP Go,

45:33.600 --> 45:40.600
and that's going to be revealed at Gamescom in Cologne this August. And they're basically

45:41.720 --> 45:48.120
saying that these games will be limited to like 100 megs, and basically the only limit

45:48.120 --> 45:53.720
for con- or that's only the limit for the content, but any apps that they want to create

45:53.720 --> 46:00.160
including non-game applications may also be available as well. So, you know, some of these

46:00.160 --> 46:05.600
smaller programs at cheaper prices or maybe, you know, free, kind of aligning themselves

46:05.600 --> 46:10.640
with, you know, what Apple has with their app store. It'd be interesting if this is

46:10.640 --> 46:15.680
going to be the draw for the PSP Go.

46:15.680 --> 46:21.920
It makes sense to me that they're going to do something like this, because really, this

46:21.920 --> 46:27.280
has to be the only thing that they've got in the cards for, because what would be the

46:27.280 --> 46:33.100
draw to the PSP Go if basically all the games are just digital downloads now and the system

46:33.100 --> 46:37.760
is more expensive? You need something unique to it to draw people to pay that extra, you

46:37.760 --> 46:38.800
know, $100.

46:38.800 --> 46:44.360
I kind of thought this already existed. Like, not so much a storefront on the PSP, but I

46:44.360 --> 46:49.680
thought, like, your PS3 store was supposed to interact with the PSP as well as you could

46:49.680 --> 46:51.520
get something like this on your PC.

46:51.520 --> 46:58.520
Well, it's not necessarily, um, not necessarily like the store that's on the PSP because that

46:58.520 --> 47:03.880
is already available right now. It's more of like the app store where you can get applications.

47:03.880 --> 47:09.300
I can buy a calculator if I wanted for this. I can buy an app to, you know, browse restaurants

47:09.300 --> 47:14.720
or some, you know, crap like that. This is what they're talking about. Not necessarily,

47:14.720 --> 47:16.600
more like, think the iPhone, you know.

47:16.600 --> 47:17.800
Well, it's not an iPhone store.

47:17.800 --> 47:18.800
Yeah, basically.

47:18.800 --> 47:20.520
Are they going to sell music and movies on it too?

47:20.520 --> 47:24.000
Well, they already do it on the PlayStation Network, so.

47:24.000 --> 47:29.200
I guess that's true. You can get it on your PSP, but I bet you they ain't doing half the

47:29.200 --> 47:30.600
business Apple is.

47:30.600 --> 47:35.240
Nope. Not for $250 when you can buy an iPhone. You know, granted, you have to lock into a

47:35.240 --> 47:37.440
contract, but for $99.

47:37.440 --> 47:41.440
Most people don't give a crap. I'll tell you what. Go to the average consumer. A lot of

47:41.440 --> 47:45.040
people do not give a crap about that contract in order to get that new hot little iPhone

47:45.040 --> 47:49.760
device. There's tons of people that are shelling out the $99 right now to do it. I have friends

47:49.760 --> 47:53.000
that have been upgrading and they're like, ah, whatever contract. I have a cell phone

47:53.000 --> 47:57.920
contract with my company right now. You know, or whatever. It's kind of an inevitable part

47:57.920 --> 48:01.240
about doing business with a phone company in this day and age, which is too bad in some

48:01.240 --> 48:02.960
ways, but.

48:02.960 --> 48:06.600
I'm probably not going to do my upgrade though for some time.

48:06.600 --> 48:12.000
No, I mean, I, I'm already an iPhone user. The 3GS does not seem to have enough. Would

48:12.000 --> 48:15.760
it just, especially with, I would have to pay extra money cause I'm not eligible for

48:15.760 --> 48:19.560
upgrade yet, which is AT&T's problem, but.

48:19.560 --> 48:24.200
Actually no, they're, they're, um, they took away that thing where.

48:24.200 --> 48:26.760
Yeah, you still have to be in a certain window though that I'm not in.

48:26.760 --> 48:33.640
Oh, well I, but I've got an old iPhone. So for me, it's, it makes perfect sense to upgrade

48:33.640 --> 48:37.400
it. Although I'm not going to do it until, you know, a cup, about a month from now, but

48:37.400 --> 48:38.400
still.

48:38.400 --> 48:39.400
Well then.

48:39.400 --> 48:40.400
Wait for them to work all the bugs out of it.

48:40.400 --> 48:43.960
Yeah. If you're still on the very, very old one, I can see why, but I'm on a 3G and there's

48:43.960 --> 48:47.960
just not enough about 3GS that really, yeah, battery life. Yes.

48:47.960 --> 48:52.280
I'm down for the faster processor myself and having a better camera on it.

48:52.280 --> 49:00.160
Hmm. Well, um, let's see. Uh, yeah, I, I don't know about this whole PSP store thing. I guess

49:00.160 --> 49:04.440
it's a good idea, but I kind of think it's like kind of in a way it's too late, but I

49:04.440 --> 49:07.920
guess there's a lot of people that don't have nor want the iPhone. And again, I have to

49:07.920 --> 49:14.040
think about that college kid audience that seems to be the PSP and target audience that,

49:14.040 --> 49:15.040
that really has these things.

49:15.040 --> 49:19.560
Here's the other thing too, the college kid audience. If you really want to, you can mod

49:19.560 --> 49:24.120
your PSP and there's the homebrew community that's already done this and has been doing

49:24.120 --> 49:28.760
this for years now. So why bother paying for something that you can get for free and it

49:28.760 --> 49:34.200
will probably end up being better anyways. And seriously, you know, if the PSP Go does

49:34.200 --> 49:39.200
take off, then those PSP 2000s and 3000s are going to be even cheaper. You know, how am

49:39.200 --> 49:44.640
I supposed to do the 2000 because the screen isn't that great on the PSP 3000. And there

49:44.640 --> 49:45.640
you go.

49:45.640 --> 49:49.240
I still have the very, very first PSP and like no memory card, but you know what else?

49:49.240 --> 49:53.440
I haven't touched it in a long time. I think the last game I really played on it was that

49:53.440 --> 49:56.640
Final Fantasy II remake they did. Well, maybe Space Invaders Extreme.

49:56.640 --> 50:00.080
What about Dissidia? Would you play that?

50:00.080 --> 50:04.000
Honestly at this point, probably not, but that's because I'm not a fan of handheld gaming

50:04.000 --> 50:07.920
in the first place. And I've gone into this rant on a previous show and I realized this

50:07.920 --> 50:12.520
is a personal preference that makes me weird than a lot of other gamers. I do not like

50:12.520 --> 50:17.520
playing portable games. The only place I can play a portable game is like at the airport,

50:17.520 --> 50:22.200
on an airplane, when I'm on a trip and don't have my consoles with me and I have to play

50:22.200 --> 50:26.840
something. But if I'm at home, I would not be caught dead with the DS in my own home

50:26.840 --> 50:31.120
playing in my house when I have a PlayStation and all this other stuff readily available

50:31.120 --> 50:32.120
to play.

50:32.120 --> 50:36.080
Well, if I want to play a particular game, if I've got the system for it, I'll just play

50:36.080 --> 50:40.600
it on whatever system it's on. If I want to play Cooking Mama, I'll play the good version

50:40.600 --> 50:43.520
on the DS, which I've been known to do.

50:43.520 --> 50:49.440
But the game, for me to go that far, there's so many games out there, it's kind of like,

50:49.440 --> 50:52.440
there's lots of games I want to play, and I'll just play the ones I want to play on

50:52.440 --> 50:58.120
the console while I'm at home. And again, I know I'm weird, but a game on the handhelds

50:58.120 --> 51:04.320
has to be really good and really anticipated for me to play them when I'm in a house.

51:04.320 --> 51:07.320
Scribble nuts!

51:07.320 --> 51:10.480
I'll probably end up picking it up for when I do travel, but I don't see myself sitting

51:10.480 --> 51:14.960
in my bed playing it. I'm just, I know I'm weird like that. I don't know. I can't explain

51:14.960 --> 51:15.960
it.

51:15.960 --> 51:17.280
Do you play games on your iPhone?

51:17.280 --> 51:23.000
Um, when I'm out and about, like if I'm at the doctor's office waiting for an appointment.

51:23.000 --> 51:24.400
But not at home?

51:24.400 --> 51:29.140
The only time I have is like, when I'm lying in bed about to go to sleep, but even then,

51:29.140 --> 51:32.280
it's usually because I just downloaded it that day and I wanted to check it out, and

51:32.280 --> 51:35.320
then maybe 10 minutes, go to bed and then don't touch it again until I'm out and about.

51:35.320 --> 51:37.360
Have they got an organ trail on the iPhone yet?

51:37.360 --> 51:38.360
I'm sure they do.

51:38.360 --> 51:41.900
There's all the time though, I sit here when I'm on, you know, chatting with people online

51:41.900 --> 51:48.880
and I'll play, I'm playing Vi right now, which was an old NES RPG that they put out on my

51:48.880 --> 51:50.880
phone. I've been playing that.

51:50.880 --> 51:56.440
Alright, so anyhow, yeah I know I'm weird about the whole handheld thing, but sorry

51:56.440 --> 52:00.880
I got off the original topic about the PSP App Store. I guess it's an inevitable thing.

52:00.880 --> 52:04.960
How successful it'll be, I guess it all depends what apps are on it, if it has the must have

52:04.960 --> 52:08.120
apps, but I don't see a lot of people just delaning it for the calculator.

52:08.120 --> 52:11.960
Let's just put it this way, let's look at what other people have done, like the DSi

52:11.960 --> 52:13.680
Store, their apps suck.

52:13.680 --> 52:16.240
Alright, let's go to the phones. Hi, you're on Orange Longest Radio, who's this?

52:16.240 --> 52:19.360
Hey, what's up everybody, this is Kajudo.

52:19.360 --> 52:20.360
Hey, Kajudo?

52:20.360 --> 52:22.360
Yeah, Kajudo, I don't know.

52:22.360 --> 52:29.960
Alright, well hey, welcome to the show. What do you think about this whole PSP Store and

52:29.960 --> 52:33.560
the PSP competing with the iPhone in a way?

52:33.560 --> 52:38.120
Well, I don't own any of the PSPs, just because it just never appealed to me. I'm

52:38.120 --> 52:43.680
more of a DS fan, where I like the innovation, and you know, they just seem to build games

52:43.680 --> 52:47.520
for that system. The PSP to me just seems like, okay, you know, you want to take your

52:47.520 --> 52:52.480
PS3 or your PlayStation 2 in the car, you can have that. And really, I'm not interested

52:52.480 --> 52:57.360
in playing those types of games in my car, you know? I rather just a little simple point

52:57.360 --> 52:58.360
and click type game.

52:58.360 --> 53:03.880
But what I'm concerned about is this, what is it? The PSP Go?

53:03.880 --> 53:06.360
Mm-hmm, the PSP Go.

53:06.360 --> 53:12.840
Alright, what happens if I install these games on the PSP Go and I get my PSP stolen or I

53:12.840 --> 53:18.160
lose it? That's like all my games are just basically down the drain now, right?

53:18.160 --> 53:23.920
They're tied to your PlayStation Network accounts, just like if your PS3 got stolen or exploded

53:23.920 --> 53:26.600
or something. So you can redownload them again.

53:26.600 --> 53:31.400
Oh, okay, I didn't know that. I thought it was something where, you know, you buy it

53:31.400 --> 53:35.320
off of their online store and it's saved on there, and if you lose it, then that's just

53:35.320 --> 53:36.320
no problem.

53:36.320 --> 53:40.560
No. Well, then that's certainly a valid concern, especially when you go to this whole digital

53:40.560 --> 53:45.200
distribution. But yeah, I know on PlayStation Network, I mean, I don't buy anything for

53:45.200 --> 53:51.000
the PSP. Well, it's the same deal. Once you buy something, it's yours and you can redownload

53:51.000 --> 53:55.840
it later if you need to. But isn't there like a thing like, there's got to be a way to prevent

53:55.840 --> 53:59.600
me from going to a friend's house and downloading the game and they play it? Like, they can't

53:59.600 --> 54:00.600
play it if they're not signed in.

54:00.600 --> 54:04.600
There, you can do that. I think you can link it to like a few different consoles or different

54:04.600 --> 54:09.880
profiles, but basically you can download it, I think, in an unlimited amount of times on

54:09.880 --> 54:10.880
your own profile.

54:10.880 --> 54:11.880
Hmm.

54:11.880 --> 54:16.800
And what if that service, for some reason, one day they no longer provide that download?

54:16.800 --> 54:21.880
That's always another concern with me with things like, what is it, Valve? Steam, Steam.

54:21.880 --> 54:25.680
I'm a little concerned with that. Like, what happens if one day Steam just goes away? Where

54:25.680 --> 54:27.280
does my games go?

54:27.280 --> 54:31.320
Then they go into oblivion, unfortunately, unless you have them downloaded to your system.

54:31.320 --> 54:35.840
Well, I would think, I would hope the respectable thing to do would be to release, if your company's

54:35.840 --> 54:42.320
about to go under, release something that's going to require, not require Steam anymore

54:42.320 --> 54:43.320
for that.

54:43.320 --> 54:48.100
Yes. That or the other option too, if you know that they're going to, you know, granted

54:48.100 --> 54:51.800
I don't think the Sony source is going to up and die all of a sudden, but I mean, if

54:51.800 --> 54:57.320
you've caught wind that, like, okay, starting December we're going to up and die, you know,

54:57.320 --> 55:01.240
you could probably, you know, back those things up to your PC if you want to, since they've

55:01.240 --> 55:05.600
just stored on, you know, the internal hard drive or memory stick or something. Well,

55:05.600 --> 55:10.320
now, you know, nowadays they're on a memory stick and you can just back that stuff up,

55:10.320 --> 55:11.320
but...

55:11.320 --> 55:16.160
Oh, Bobby Blackwolf in chat would like to clarify, Steam has a failsafe for that reason.

55:16.160 --> 55:20.200
They've already stated that. If they go under, they will remove the digital rights management.

55:20.200 --> 55:24.040
So it's kind of like I speculated that they would do the right thing and just disable

55:24.040 --> 55:28.080
the necessity of having Steam in the first place. So, well, hey, thank you so much for

55:28.080 --> 55:29.640
the call and we appreciate it.

55:29.640 --> 55:34.120
I just have one game recommendation for Loki. You just get the fashion gorilla.

55:34.120 --> 55:36.640
I have it. I just haven't played it yet.

55:36.640 --> 55:40.280
Oh, you got to try it. I mean, that's the only game that made me put down GPA because

55:40.280 --> 55:41.440
I'm a GPA freak.

55:41.440 --> 55:46.920
I really do want to play it and, you know, playing Saints of O2 today or, well, not today,

55:46.920 --> 55:51.560
but earlier this week, because they have one of the vehicles from Red Faction in there.

55:51.560 --> 55:56.160
It's like this SUV with a rocket launcher on top of it, which is awesome. But, you know,

55:56.160 --> 55:59.520
I was like, oh, yeah, I really got to play that game. And I also have Prototype too,

55:59.520 --> 56:03.880
so I have to go back to that and Fuel, I have to go play that. So there's a lot of stuff

56:03.880 --> 56:06.120
and I just got my, you know, I'm trying to unpack right now.

56:06.120 --> 56:07.960
Now is just not a good time to move.

56:07.960 --> 56:12.540
It's not. You know, I had to unpack. You know, the summer is dead for me as far as what's

56:12.540 --> 56:16.080
coming out. So, you know, it's a good time to get all these games now because then I

56:16.080 --> 56:17.080
can play them through the summer.

56:17.080 --> 56:19.080
All right. Well, thank you so much for the call.

56:19.080 --> 56:20.080
Well, thank you for the show. Good night, guys.

56:20.080 --> 56:21.080
All right. Take care, buddy.

56:21.080 --> 56:24.520
All right. 1-877-GAME-OLR if you want to comment on stories.

56:24.520 --> 56:28.320
We are going to move on to our next story tonight, which has to do with Microsoft. We've

56:28.320 --> 56:33.680
been hazing Sony a lot tonight. Let's give Microsoft a little bit of hazing too. This

56:33.680 --> 56:36.660
actually is a little bit of a follow-up to something we were talking about last week.

56:36.660 --> 56:39.480
Last week, there was a rumor going around that Project Natal was actually going to be

56:39.480 --> 56:43.680
the centerpiece of a new console that Microsoft is going to be releasing.

56:43.680 --> 56:47.280
I thought that the rumor was actually that it was going to be treated like a console

56:47.280 --> 56:49.400
launch and people thought that it was going to be a new console.

56:49.400 --> 56:54.160
That's what I thought too, but also the fact that it was going to be like a, not so much

56:54.160 --> 56:59.400
like a new console console, but like, you know how PlayStation 1 and then there's PlayStation

56:59.400 --> 57:04.280
1 Slim a couple years later. I think the thought was there was going to be like an Xbox 360

57:04.280 --> 57:13.440
Slim. Well, the CEO of Microsoft, Steve Ballmer, actually came out and said that, well, I'm

57:13.440 --> 57:17.120
sorry, that actually, he was the guy that made that first remark about the whole Xbox

57:17.120 --> 57:22.420
360 hardware integration that caused everybody to run with everything going on here.

57:22.420 --> 57:27.320
The director of product management for Xbox 360 and Xbox Live, Aaron Greenberg, actually

57:27.320 --> 57:32.960
straight up told Kotaku earlier this week, there will be no console. We're not going

57:32.960 --> 57:36.900
to be launching a new console anytime soon. I really believe he was speaking about Project

57:36.900 --> 57:41.120
Natal. We want to make sure people know that we're excited about Project Natal, but we're

57:41.120 --> 57:45.640
barely halfway through this generation. We're happy with the Xbox 360, so there are no changes

57:45.640 --> 57:49.760
from that standpoint. For the time being, we're really just showing a whole new category

57:49.760 --> 57:55.300
of gaming. And then they're talking about, are they thinking about doing the hands-free

57:55.300 --> 58:00.640
stuff in a new Xbox 360 configuration? They did say, yes, we have looked at that, but

58:00.640 --> 58:03.240
we haven't seen, announced any details for something like that.

58:03.240 --> 58:07.160
I think they're just really kind of lying by omission basically.

58:07.160 --> 58:15.840
I think that's exactly what they're doing. I think there is. In a way, here's the most

58:15.840 --> 58:20.800
important quotes from this. We are saying that the Natal will run on the Xbox 360, so

58:20.800 --> 58:26.240
there's no new hardware to purchase. What we're doing that's unique is instead of asking

58:26.240 --> 58:31.400
you to invest in a new generation of hardware, a generation that's already well established,

58:31.400 --> 58:35.240
extending the experience even longer by adding this whole new category of experiences with

58:35.240 --> 58:39.320
Project Natal. We're changing the rules just a little bit like we did with the new Xbox

58:39.320 --> 58:40.320
experience.

58:40.320 --> 58:43.880
It's just going to be, they're going to do a new console. It may be slimmed down, it

58:43.880 --> 58:48.120
may not be slimmed down, but it's going to be some sort of a new revision, and it's going

58:48.120 --> 58:52.880
to have Natal with it. That's basically it. It may be integrated into it if they decide

58:52.880 --> 58:56.720
to actually slim down the form factor of it, but there will be a new console. There will

58:56.720 --> 59:02.040
not be a new console because it's not going to be the Xbox, the next one, the 720 or whatever

59:02.040 --> 59:07.040
you want to call it. It won't be a new console in that sense, but just like how the PlayStation

59:07.040 --> 59:13.240
2, spelled out T-W-O, is not a new console, it's just a slimmer console. It's the same

59:13.240 --> 59:15.760
console, but just, it's just...

59:15.760 --> 59:21.500
You notice the way he's wording it. He's not saying no. He's not saying no. He's reassuring

59:21.500 --> 59:26.360
people that they're not going to have to buy a new console to enjoy Project Natal. He didn't

59:26.360 --> 59:31.160
come out and say, we're not releasing a new set of hardware. He didn't really say that.

59:31.160 --> 59:35.000
He said, don't worry. Project Natal will work on your existing hardware. That's what I'm

59:35.000 --> 59:40.680
hearing. He's reassuring people that they don't need to do this hardware upgrade, but

59:40.680 --> 59:42.640
I still think there's going to be...

59:42.640 --> 59:45.140
There has to be some perks to doing an upgrade.

59:45.140 --> 59:48.800
I think there will be at least a bundle that comes with Natal. I think they're really going

59:48.800 --> 59:53.260
to push this thing. Why shouldn't they? It is their answer to the Wii after all.

59:53.260 --> 59:57.520
It's going to be kind of they're going to treat it like a new launch, so why not relaunch

59:57.520 --> 01:00:00.560
the system? See, because that's what they're going to do. They're even going to probably

01:00:00.560 --> 01:00:07.120
phrase it like that. This is the next generation in gaming, so let's launch it like the next

01:00:07.120 --> 01:00:09.160
generation in gaming.

01:00:09.160 --> 01:00:14.600
It's not like Microsoft doesn't make changes to their hardware ever, because earlier this

01:00:14.600 --> 01:00:18.960
week it was reported that some of these new arcade units are out there, and they have

01:00:18.960 --> 01:00:22.920
double the internal memory, which is funny because he references this whole, just like

01:00:22.920 --> 01:00:28.220
we did with new Xbox experience, they work on the old Xbox, but in reality they did go

01:00:28.220 --> 01:00:31.800
back and pump up the hardware a little bit. Because remember, you couldn't really have

01:00:31.800 --> 01:00:37.200
NXE on your system if you didn't have a hard drive, or what was it? A memory card or something?

01:00:37.200 --> 01:00:42.760
You had no memory. You can't even store NXE, but now there's hardware out there that they've

01:00:42.760 --> 01:00:48.460
doubled the memory that it's now, what, 512 megs built in that can fit NXE and probably

01:00:48.460 --> 01:00:54.560
some of the other stuff on your actual physical drive.

01:00:54.560 --> 01:00:56.220
And they've gotten rid of the arcade games.

01:00:56.220 --> 01:01:01.280
This kind of conflicts with what he's saying.

01:01:01.280 --> 01:01:03.800
I knew this was coming a long time. Actually, it's funny.

01:01:03.800 --> 01:01:05.400
I remember you saying something on the show.

01:01:05.400 --> 01:01:11.400
Yes, I did. They were slowly transitioning. It was the console, they had the holiday bundles

01:01:11.400 --> 01:01:16.960
that they can do with the games packed in, then they were going to have the console without

01:01:16.960 --> 01:01:23.660
the games, and it was going to have the integrated memory, and then they were going to double

01:01:23.660 --> 01:01:29.160
the memory inside it and get rid of the arcade games, and I think that's what this is now.

01:01:29.160 --> 01:01:32.240
I'm not sure if they actually went through getting rid of the arcade games, but I think

01:01:32.240 --> 01:01:33.240
they did.

01:01:33.240 --> 01:01:41.860
Yeah, it's not surprising. They make little revisions. In this case, it's just so every

01:01:41.860 --> 01:01:46.000
console now can have NXE stored on it, because it's important for them.

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:50.320
I hope that they do make a slimmer one. I could be talked into upgrading my system,

01:01:50.320 --> 01:01:51.320
actually.

01:01:51.320 --> 01:01:52.320
I wouldn't.

01:01:52.320 --> 01:01:58.640
I don't have a cold-ass Xbox 360. I could be talked into it for HDMI, quieter system,

01:01:58.640 --> 01:02:02.040
and maybe any other perks they're going to throw at me with new hardware.

01:02:02.040 --> 01:02:11.800
It would be quieter because of the smaller chipsets, less heat, less need for a huge

01:02:11.800 --> 01:02:12.800
fan.

01:02:12.800 --> 01:02:15.760
But here's my concern. My old hard drive's not going to work with it, because if they

01:02:15.760 --> 01:02:18.480
slim down the system, that massive drive's not going to fit on it.

01:02:18.480 --> 01:02:23.760
No, they could. It'd be the same thickness, or maybe it'll plug into the top. They could

01:02:23.760 --> 01:02:24.760
do it.

01:02:24.760 --> 01:02:28.120
Interesting. I hope they do. I hope they do, because I wouldn't want to have to get a new

01:02:28.120 --> 01:02:32.840
drive and all that stuff again. That would turn me off. We'll see.

01:02:32.840 --> 01:02:37.280
I would think that they would. I mean, look at the police station slim. I mean, all the

01:02:37.280 --> 01:02:41.200
peripherals, for the most part, worked with it. I mean, there's obviously no multi-tap

01:02:41.200 --> 01:02:49.440
doesn't. So other interesting things, kind of going back to talking about Activision

01:02:49.440 --> 01:02:51.440
again.

01:02:51.440 --> 01:02:58.040
Activision had, I guess the prices for their new peripheral games are actually starting

01:02:58.040 --> 01:03:03.040
to come out online. You know, as retailers like Amazon and GameStop and stuff like that

01:03:03.040 --> 01:03:07.480
are starting to take preorders on them. And people are kind of shocked at how expensive

01:03:07.480 --> 01:03:08.480
they are.

01:03:08.480 --> 01:03:12.560
Now, this is Activision we're talking about here. I'm not shocked at how expensive they

01:03:12.560 --> 01:03:19.920
are, but it is interesting, though. Like, for example, DJ Hero. I think we talked about

01:03:19.920 --> 01:03:24.900
this a little bit before. It's going to retail for $120, and it's, of course, bundled in

01:03:24.900 --> 01:03:31.520
with the DJ controller, which, when you look at, like, previously releases, like, say,

01:03:31.520 --> 01:03:37.160
you know, Guitar Hero with a guitar bundled with it, that's typically been $99.99 for

01:03:37.160 --> 01:03:43.000
an Xbox 360 or PlayStation 3 version. The PlayStation 2 version, though, is coming out

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:47.720
at $99.99, so there is, like, a $30 premium on all these different games.

01:03:47.720 --> 01:03:53.480
Another game that's coming out for that same $120 price point would be the new Tony Hawk

01:03:53.480 --> 01:03:57.560
game. But, you know, once again, the controller with it is kind of sophisticated. There is

01:03:57.560 --> 01:04:02.400
a lot of equipment in there, so maybe that's why the price point's a little higher.

01:04:02.400 --> 01:04:08.840
But what is really interesting, though, is Band Hero, the little-known, you know, Guitar

01:04:08.840 --> 01:04:13.000
Hero game kind of aimed towards the family. They have a super bundle that's basically

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:19.440
coming out that's going to include, supposedly, like, a drum kit, a guitar, and, you know,

01:04:19.440 --> 01:04:24.880
microphone, kind of what you got in World Tour, and that's going to run you $199, whereas

01:04:24.880 --> 01:04:29.760
the World Tour kit, you know, runs you a lot less than that. So, it's kind of interesting,

01:04:29.760 --> 01:04:34.080
though, that they're kind of pumping up everything by, like, $30. And, you know, what's funny

01:04:34.080 --> 01:04:38.080
is when I read about this, I was kind of wondering, maybe they're throwing in, like, two guitars

01:04:38.080 --> 01:04:44.160
and a drum set or something like that. But I looked at the weights comparing World Tour

01:04:44.160 --> 01:04:48.800
and Band Hero's bundles, and the weights are almost identical. So it is going to be the

01:04:48.800 --> 01:04:53.800
same bundle as you got with World Tour. They're not actually adding anything more to it. It's

01:04:53.800 --> 01:04:59.560
just, for whatever reason, they think that they can get, you know, extra money for it.

01:04:59.560 --> 01:05:02.920
Maybe that's, you know, a little bit coming from, you know, maybe they think they can

01:05:02.920 --> 01:05:07.640
do that since, you know, Beatles Rock Band is going to be $250. So maybe they think they're

01:05:07.640 --> 01:05:12.440
justified in that sense. Okay, well, what's Band Hero bringing new to the table? I can

01:05:12.440 --> 01:05:17.160
tell you what Beatles Rock Band is bringing new to the table. But what is, well, I don't

01:05:17.160 --> 01:05:20.560
know, some folks might want to argue with me on that, but at the same time, I'm telling

01:05:20.560 --> 01:05:27.040
you, put the Beatles Rock Band gameplay next to Guitar Hero Van Halen gameplay, and I'll

01:05:27.040 --> 01:05:31.320
tell you what justifies that premium Beatles price. You know what I mean? Here's something

01:05:31.320 --> 01:05:37.040
funny though, if you think about it, okay? Guitar Hero World Tour right now, I think

01:05:37.040 --> 01:05:42.840
is like $180, if I remember correctly. I think it's like $179.99. In fact, I'm going to look

01:05:42.840 --> 01:05:47.440
that up right now. But let's just assume, you know, with Guitar Hero 5 coming out, you

01:05:47.440 --> 01:05:52.840
gotta think that they're probably going to do a price drop on Guitar Hero World Tour.

01:05:52.840 --> 01:05:56.180
You know, because they gotta clear out the extra units that they have, and maybe they're

01:05:56.180 --> 01:06:00.040
not going to do it right away, but you would think that they're going to drop it, because

01:06:00.040 --> 01:06:04.680
that's what they normally do. They drop the version that came out last year, you know,

01:06:04.680 --> 01:06:08.360
in preparation for the new one. So you've got the bundles that are available out there

01:06:08.360 --> 01:06:15.360
right now, you know, for World Tour, and say that you can get them for, I don't know, $150.00.

01:06:15.360 --> 01:06:22.960
$149.99. I'm sure that's not too much of a stretch. Okay, so now you have this new game

01:06:22.960 --> 01:06:30.920
coming out for $200.00. Why should I buy that bundle when I can buy a bundle with World

01:06:30.920 --> 01:06:35.820
Tour, and I can buy the game only of Band Hero for the same price as buying the bundle

01:06:35.820 --> 01:06:44.640
for Band Hero? It makes no sense whatsoever. So, I don't know. I mean, it does seem kind

01:06:44.640 --> 01:06:51.640
of a rip-off to be spending that kind of money on a bundle that, you know, is readily available

01:06:51.640 --> 01:07:00.120
right now for a cheaper price. And yeah, looks like World Tour, the band kits, okay, $190.00.

01:07:00.120 --> 01:07:06.760
So they're still pretty expensive. Actually, $190.00, you know, right now, that wouldn't

01:07:06.760 --> 01:07:12.640
be that, but it's still $10.00 more than, you know. But, you know, what, for $10.00

01:07:12.640 --> 01:07:16.960
for what? Even $10.00 is $10.00 still. Yeah. Especially considering, you know, they're

01:07:16.960 --> 01:07:21.080
not bringing that much new to the table, it sounds like. But here's my thing. I'm going

01:07:21.080 --> 01:07:25.760
back to the DJ Hero thing for a minute, because I'm excited about DJ Hero. It looks like the

01:07:25.760 --> 01:07:31.240
game's going to be pretty cool. The song list looks pretty awesome. It looks innovative,

01:07:31.240 --> 01:07:34.920
this whole thing. But when I heard it was $120.00, it was like getting kicked in the

01:07:34.920 --> 01:07:41.680
crotch. Like, $120.00 is a lot of money. And, you know, I'll tell you what, if they had

01:07:41.680 --> 01:07:46.560
said $99.00, I would have been like, sold, gonna buy it, I'm there, yep, I got it, day

01:07:46.560 --> 01:07:52.200
gone, right? But it's that third digit that makes all the difference, in my mind, as a

01:07:52.200 --> 01:07:56.480
consumer. I don't know what it is. I'm very disappointed. I gotta see what I'm getting

01:07:56.480 --> 01:08:01.440
for my, you know, $120.00. Honestly, I'm still probably going to buy it, because it's a game

01:08:01.440 --> 01:08:05.880
that really interests me, and the price, you know. I want to get the actual special bundle

01:08:05.880 --> 01:08:11.200
with the carrying case and a lot of fun stuff, because that, I like to travel with my game

01:08:11.200 --> 01:08:16.920
consoles and peripherals and stuff like that. So that, you know, would appeal to me. But

01:08:16.920 --> 01:08:21.520
I want to see what I'm getting for this $120.00, because it's kind of expensive for, you know,

01:08:21.520 --> 01:08:26.920
and I know the peripheral is kind of neat, but I'm sorry, it's a turntable. It can't

01:08:26.920 --> 01:08:32.040
be that sophisticated. It's, we've had BeatMania controllers out there, and I mean, really,

01:08:32.040 --> 01:08:36.460
we're not talking too much different than that. And hell, the guitars aren't even that

01:08:36.460 --> 01:08:44.280
sophisticated. So, where's the money going? Yeah, that's kind of why I'm curious about

01:08:44.280 --> 01:08:48.920
that too. And I think what also really sucks is that you can't really demo DJ Hero, you

01:08:48.920 --> 01:08:53.720
know what I mean? You're going to have to either play it in a store, play it at a friend's,

01:08:53.720 --> 01:08:58.680
or take a chance. And you want to hear something funny? This is coming from a company that's

01:08:58.680 --> 01:09:06.760
bitching about the price being too high for the Playstation 3. Funny, I didn't even think

01:09:06.760 --> 01:09:12.920
about that. You're absolutely right. You know, oh, the Playstation 3's too high? Hell, that's

01:09:12.920 --> 01:09:18.760
almost the price of our, you know, what is it? Banned Hero. If they drop the Playstation

01:09:18.760 --> 01:09:24.840
3 price another $100.00, it will be the price of their Banned Hero bundle. I'm sorry, that

01:09:24.840 --> 01:09:33.760
seems kind of a rip-off to me. But, you know, at the same time, you know, Banned Hero seems

01:09:33.760 --> 01:09:39.120
kind of a rip-off anyways. I mean, why do we need that many games out at the same time?

01:09:39.120 --> 01:09:43.000
I mean, and we haven't really seen anything about it, other than I saw a trailer that

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:46.940
said Banned Hero on it, and that's about it. And honestly, I couldn't have told you if

01:09:46.940 --> 01:09:51.440
that was Guitar Hero 5 or Banned Hero what? I think we talked about this on the show last

01:09:51.440 --> 01:09:56.640
week. I thought it was Guitar Hero 5. I thought the name of Guitar Hero 5 was Banned Hero.

01:09:56.640 --> 01:10:00.240
And I do a show about games every week. I'm supposed to be on top of this stuff. I literally

01:10:00.240 --> 01:10:03.480
thought Guitar Hero 5 was just called Banned Hero. I thought that's what it was. It was

01:10:03.480 --> 01:10:10.600
the same game. I was like, no, they're putting out two? Really? Do we need that? Well, okay,

01:10:10.600 --> 01:10:14.000
Van Halen's coming out at the beginning of August. Guitar Hero 5's coming out at the

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:21.280
beginning of September. Banned Hero's coming out in October. That's too much. That is a

01:10:21.280 --> 01:10:26.640
lot. I don't know. Yeah, I don't know. I'm not feeling it. Especially, you know they're

01:10:26.640 --> 01:10:31.960
going to charge like 50 bucks for Guitar Hero or Van Halen. It's too much. Yep. Too much.

01:10:31.960 --> 01:10:36.960
Alright, well, I guess that's them. We'll see how this sells, of course, and how you

01:10:36.960 --> 01:10:40.800
guys anticipate it. Not a lot of chat. They're talking about pay goal in the chat room. I

01:10:40.800 --> 01:10:45.560
guess there's not a lot of care about DJ Hero or Banned Hero. I don't know. Alright, well

01:10:45.560 --> 01:10:51.040
that's what it is. Let's shift topics and talk about another game. And this game definitely

01:10:51.040 --> 01:10:57.040
has its cult following, which used to be me many, many years ago. Magic the Gathering.

01:10:57.040 --> 01:11:04.880
Hey, hey, hey. That was me in college in Alabama. And it was me in high school many years ago,

01:11:04.880 --> 01:11:08.480
actually. I've actually got a couple magic decks over here. I got them for free. Here's

01:11:08.480 --> 01:11:12.800
the thing about Magic the Gathering. Say what you will. Call me whatever name you want in

01:11:12.800 --> 01:11:17.720
the book. I do think Magic the Gathering is actually a lot of fun. It's just a good game.

01:11:17.720 --> 01:11:24.440
Like I think it's a good card game to play. But it can be a lot of money. Like I remember

01:11:24.440 --> 01:11:27.000
you know with the cards and everything, like paying the money to get the cards. It can

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:31.740
be a lot of money. And the reason why I bring this up now is that Magic the Gathering is

01:11:31.740 --> 01:11:36.680
making a comeback of sorts. Magic the Gathering was just released on Xbox Live this week.

01:11:36.680 --> 01:11:40.720
I'm not sure if you guys caught it amongst all the downtime. And I didn't even mention

01:11:40.720 --> 01:11:45.480
it in my gaming week, but that's because I played a demo, not the full version. But Xbox

01:11:45.480 --> 01:11:50.920
Live now has Magic the Gathering, Duels of the Planeswalkers. It is there. You can download

01:11:50.920 --> 01:11:55.340
this game. It's available. And in the game, it's basically, you know, you can put together

01:11:55.340 --> 01:11:58.840
your own. From what I understand, I haven't played the full version. But from what I understand,

01:11:58.840 --> 01:12:03.480
because in the demo you're limited to like one battle with a green card only deck basically.

01:12:03.480 --> 01:12:10.000
But the enemy has a red card only deck. Which means you're screwed? I guess, yeah. In the

01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:13.400
full version of the game, you can kind of make your own deck. You can do your own thing

01:12:13.400 --> 01:12:18.920
with it, you know, of the cards that are there. You gain and lose cards as you fight enemies

01:12:18.920 --> 01:12:24.320
and so forth. So yeah, it's hard for me. And like Lazy Days in chat says, demos don't count.

01:12:24.320 --> 01:12:27.400
Yes. I don't want to base my evaluation of the game off of it. So I'm not going to tell

01:12:27.400 --> 01:12:32.200
you whether to buy it or not. I will just say, you know, it was kind of neat to see

01:12:32.200 --> 01:12:36.000
a resurgence of Magic the Gathering. But what I do think is interesting is that they're

01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:41.780
talking about download content. Here's the thing though. Download content is not going

01:12:41.780 --> 01:12:46.480
to work the way that it does for Magic the Gathering online. Because you have to remember

01:12:46.480 --> 01:12:51.580
there's now three ways to play Magic the Gathering. You have Xbox Live. You have the card, good

01:12:51.580 --> 01:12:57.360
old card and table and all that stuff. Or you have Magic the Gathering online. The interesting

01:12:57.360 --> 01:13:03.240
thing about Magic the Gathering online, they have really tried to mirror the card playing

01:13:03.240 --> 01:13:08.440
experience right on down to what you pay for it. If you weren't aware, if you want to play

01:13:08.440 --> 01:13:13.480
Magic the Gathering online, it's essentially free. You have to pay $10. And I did a little

01:13:13.480 --> 01:13:17.000
research today. I've never played Magic the Gathering online, but I did some research.

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:21.760
If I wanted to play, what would it take? You pay it like a $10 registration fee, but that

01:13:21.760 --> 01:13:28.760
$10 goes towards a coupon that you use in their store. And you buy decks just like walking

01:13:28.760 --> 01:13:32.640
into a comic book store and buying a deck. You buy booster packs just like you would

01:13:32.640 --> 01:13:38.040
buy a booster pack in a store of 12 random cards or what have you. And it's the same

01:13:38.040 --> 01:13:43.040
price with tax and all that stuff. So you literally, but they make it very clear. There

01:13:43.040 --> 01:13:48.920
is no, you don't buy these things online and then get a paper copy of the card. Just like

01:13:48.920 --> 01:13:53.400
you don't buy the paper cards and get an online code to get the same card. That is not how

01:13:53.400 --> 01:13:56.240
it works. Which it should though, because that'd be pretty cool. There's two different

01:13:56.240 --> 01:14:00.680
games here. Magic the Gathering online and Magic the Gathering paper. But the reason

01:14:00.680 --> 01:14:06.400
why I bring this whole thing up is because that now they have this download content.

01:14:06.400 --> 01:14:10.720
The deal is you're not going to get booster packs with Xbox Live download content. You're

01:14:10.720 --> 01:14:15.760
basically buying all new decks. There's no random cards. You know what you're going to

01:14:15.760 --> 01:14:21.880
be getting out of this when you go in to buy it. And this is from an interview on Destructoid.com.

01:14:21.880 --> 01:14:26.320
Senior brand manager Worth Woolport actually was quoted saying, a good way to think of

01:14:26.320 --> 01:14:30.800
it is like the old theme decks or our current intro decks. It's that kind of option to add

01:14:30.800 --> 01:14:36.240
onto your gaming experience. And it's all set. It's not randomized at all. By the way,

01:14:36.240 --> 01:14:42.320
they're also going to have themes, play mats, like the background you can buy. Yeah. And

01:14:42.320 --> 01:14:49.720
gamer pictures. Okay. But what about for the people that's over it? I mean, what appeal

01:14:49.720 --> 01:14:54.120
is it going to have for all the people who've moved on? Is there anything that's going to

01:14:54.120 --> 01:14:59.820
bring anyone back? What about the face to face, you know, playing with somebody? Well,

01:14:59.820 --> 01:15:03.840
I don't know. I actually, to be honest, Jamie, I think this is it to bring the old people

01:15:03.840 --> 01:15:07.880
back is that you don't have to put up with the boosters and all these extra little costs

01:15:07.880 --> 01:15:12.520
here. I, I, in a way, I think if I was going to play Magic the Gathering more regularly,

01:15:12.520 --> 01:15:18.360
this is appealing to me. When I played, when I played Magic regularly, I loved being able

01:15:18.360 --> 01:15:23.840
to collect all the rare cards and to, you know, to have the collection that other people

01:15:23.840 --> 01:15:27.920
went, ooh. But wouldn't it bug you when someone when you were playing would pull out that

01:15:27.920 --> 01:15:32.320
effing card that you, is so rare, there's no way in hell you're going to get it. You

01:15:32.320 --> 01:15:35.360
know, that type of thing and then it's being used in a match. I mean, one thing you can

01:15:35.360 --> 01:15:39.840
say about the Microsoft way of doing it on Xbox Live, everybody's on the same page. Everybody's

01:15:39.840 --> 01:15:44.960
on equal free. See, that, that's not fun to me. If I wanted to play, you know, a certain

01:15:44.960 --> 01:15:49.120
type of match, you know, I would say, hey, do you have a type two deck? Do you have a

01:15:49.120 --> 01:15:53.320
type one deck? You know, do you have old school type one? I don't even know what that means.

01:15:53.320 --> 01:15:57.000
That's funny. That's true for tournament. I used to do tournament play. Wow. Back in

01:15:57.000 --> 01:16:01.960
the day. And I just say like, hey, you know, if you've got this type of deck, then we'll

01:16:01.960 --> 01:16:05.760
play this kind of game. If you want to bring out the, the strong stuff, you know, we would

01:16:05.760 --> 01:16:11.960
actually set up those parameters first. So it was a much broader scope of play if you

01:16:11.960 --> 01:16:17.560
had this together. I've seen people take out wimpy ass starter pack decks and beat people

01:16:17.560 --> 01:16:23.520
with, you know, the hardcore expensive deck just because they were a better player. So

01:16:23.520 --> 01:16:27.480
I think that that actually removes an aspect of the challenge. I think that it takes out

01:16:27.480 --> 01:16:33.840
some of the fun. I mean, not everyone is going to be equal. I'm sorry. There's no such thing

01:16:33.840 --> 01:16:39.800
as everybody equal. You may be able to match the cards, you know, for everybody, but you're

01:16:39.800 --> 01:16:45.560
never going to match the skill. And I think that that really takes away a lot of the experience

01:16:45.560 --> 01:16:49.080
in play. Well, from what I understand, you still build your own deck. It's just that

01:16:49.080 --> 01:16:53.160
everybody has the same card pool to build from. And yeah, okay. You're a collector by

01:16:53.160 --> 01:16:58.520
nature. Jamie, you, you collect video games, you collect systems, you collect lots of stuff.

01:16:58.520 --> 01:17:04.040
You're a collector by nature. I can see your argument for me. That's too much money. I

01:17:04.040 --> 01:17:09.400
can't, I can't do it. I will tell you, I spent a lot of money on this as a kid. My first

01:17:09.400 --> 01:17:15.120
collection. Oh, that's right. You were a kid, weren't you? I was playing, I was playing

01:17:15.120 --> 01:17:18.880
in college. I would have been, I wasn't that far behind you. I was playing this when I

01:17:18.880 --> 01:17:21.960
was a sophomore, junior in high school. You were what, two years older than me. So right

01:17:21.960 --> 01:17:29.240
around the same there. Yeah. Um, what, um, Loki was a child, not a child, but the whole

01:17:29.240 --> 01:17:36.840
thing is that I actually built up a collection, sold it for about a $1,500 of D and D books,

01:17:36.840 --> 01:17:42.840
which I still have. And then probably rebuilt my collection just because, you know, it's,

01:17:42.840 --> 01:17:47.880
it's its own currency. You have to be smart with the building and trading. And you know,

01:17:47.880 --> 01:17:51.440
my last collection by that time I didn't care anymore. Nobody wanted to pay what it was

01:17:51.440 --> 01:17:59.440
worth, but still it's, it's a matter of what are you in it for? You know, oh, for a lot

01:17:59.440 --> 01:18:05.760
of people, the fun comes not just in the playing, but in the having. Our, our good friend, Marissa's

01:18:05.760 --> 01:18:10.960
in chat, Marissa Congusto and says, I was in elementary school for the win. Don't I

01:18:10.960 --> 01:18:17.720
feel like grandpa? Oh, we do love Marissa though. And we wanted to come visit the show,

01:18:17.720 --> 01:18:22.760
by the way, Marissa or Jamie and I are just going to have to end up in LA at the same

01:18:22.760 --> 01:18:26.200
weekend and make that habit. All right. And Loki somehow is going to have to be talked

01:18:26.200 --> 01:18:30.480
into making the trip. Um, let's see. I do want to say though, I, what else I thought

01:18:30.480 --> 01:18:35.320
was interesting about this whole magic, the gathering story was that, uh, they also, in

01:18:35.320 --> 01:18:39.960
this interview, uh, the brand manager would not really say how much it's going to cost

01:18:39.960 --> 01:18:45.560
because he says, as far as price, all that stuff is dictated by Microsoft. The game itself

01:18:45.560 --> 01:18:51.800
came out at 800 Microsoft points, which we think is an absolute steal of value. Frankly,

01:18:51.800 --> 01:18:59.440
you can almost hear that hidden subtext of we think this game is undervalued by Microsoft.

01:18:59.440 --> 01:19:04.000
And I think to the hardcore fans, maybe it is. I mean, think about it. 10 bucks gets

01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:11.520
you what some people have spent lots more money on another online gaming platform to

01:19:11.520 --> 01:19:16.520
have. That's fascinating to me. I don't know why. Maybe I'm just weird. Maybe it's the

01:19:16.520 --> 01:19:19.760
memories I have. I'm sure they would have done booster packs and stuff if they had a

01:19:19.760 --> 01:19:25.080
way to do random cards like that. But because you know, it's, you know, pay X amount of

01:19:25.080 --> 01:19:33.720
points download, you know, this data done, you know, it's just, I don't know. You can't

01:19:33.720 --> 01:19:39.760
do it too bad for them. I do want to check out the full version of the game though. I

01:19:39.760 --> 01:19:43.640
think I will probably die as soon as I finish up some of this final fantasy and other stuff

01:19:43.640 --> 01:19:47.400
I've been playing. I'll probably get a little more into magic, the gathering, and I would

01:19:47.400 --> 01:19:52.680
love to play Jamie on Xbox live, but I don't know if she'll want to spend the 10 bucks.

01:19:52.680 --> 01:19:59.480
It might be fun though. God, it really has been years. Me too. Me too. I bear two decks

01:19:59.480 --> 01:20:04.600
here on my desk. Rob, when I was going through that tutorial, I was like, Oh my God, this

01:20:04.600 --> 01:20:08.000
is almost too much to remember. Like I wait, I have to hit a button to interrupt if I want

01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:12.280
to actually use this. So, Oh my gosh, she really does. She just whipped it out. It's

01:20:12.280 --> 01:20:18.440
a sealed deck for God's sake. I challenge you, Rob. Ready to play 30 card deck and quick

01:20:18.440 --> 01:20:23.320
start guide. For real, these are two starter decks? Two starter decks. I challenge you,

01:20:23.320 --> 01:20:28.440
Rob. You should have a battle on the show. Not right now. Not right now. Maybe like it's

01:20:28.440 --> 01:20:31.920
a special one off show or something. We have a white deck and a green deck, which means

01:20:31.920 --> 01:20:38.960
it'll be a fucking long game. We should do this as like a special spinoff show or something.

01:20:38.960 --> 01:20:43.720
And maybe Loki can provide commentary. I don't know what the hell's going on, nor do I care.

01:20:43.720 --> 01:20:47.640
That would be what was funny about it. If this has that phasing bullshit in it though,

01:20:47.640 --> 01:20:52.480
I'm out. What the hell is phasing? I don't even know. Actually I stopped playing when

01:20:52.480 --> 01:20:56.360
they put in phasing, which means like one card is in play for one turn and then you

01:20:56.360 --> 01:21:02.480
have to skip the next one with that card. And then, so they phase and bullshit. Weird.

01:21:02.480 --> 01:21:10.480
I'm sorry, Rob. My deck was black red. I would spawn thralls and throw fireballs and people

01:21:10.480 --> 01:21:15.880
hated it. All right. This battle is happening. This must happen. You've got the white deck.

01:21:15.880 --> 01:21:18.600
I've got the green deck. Fine. Whatever. I don't care. Well, you're holding the white

01:21:18.600 --> 01:21:22.240
deck, so I'm just saying. But we need to set a time. Sealed deck tourney. All right. Sealed

01:21:22.240 --> 01:21:30.520
deck tourney. And I haven't played in years. And they are sealed completely sealed. I will

01:21:30.520 --> 01:21:35.160
take a picture and put it on the website so that you can see that they're sealed. How

01:21:35.160 --> 01:21:39.880
about we do this on, what are you doing on Wednesday, Rob? Uh, I have to check with the

01:21:39.880 --> 01:21:45.400
significant other, but I think I will be free. Bring the significant other. It's on. He's

01:21:45.400 --> 01:21:51.000
going to think it's the dumbest thing. We're going to get sandwiches and a beer. No, not

01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:56.600
beer. We're going to get sandwiches and lemonade and play magic. If this weekend wasn't birthday

01:21:56.600 --> 01:22:00.480
slash pride slash whatever, I would say, let's do it this weekend. But, and then you're going

01:22:00.480 --> 01:22:05.120
to Las Vegas the next week, huh? You're going to be gone. All right, we'll make it happen.

01:22:05.120 --> 01:22:10.400
We'll figure something out behind the scenes. We are, this is going to be, it will be all

01:22:10.400 --> 01:22:14.120
right. Uh, and of course the chat is very supportive of the whole magic, the gathering

01:22:14.120 --> 01:22:20.360
sealed deck tournament. We should turn it into a drinking game. We've got the geekery

01:22:20.360 --> 01:22:25.680
instead of 20 life points. We should have 20 shot glass. Rob, this is so fucking ridiculous.

01:22:25.680 --> 01:22:30.760
Especially since how would you get your life back? You just, I don't know. Especially since

01:22:30.760 --> 01:22:35.240
I haven't really wanted to play magic in forever. I just got the decks cause they were freaking

01:22:35.240 --> 01:22:39.840
free. I thought I'd give them to somebody or we'd give them away on the show. How about

01:22:39.840 --> 01:22:46.320
this? How about the winning deck is a giveaway or we'll just give all the cards away to somebody

01:22:46.320 --> 01:22:49.800
who actually listens to our tournament show. All right, look, we're spending too much time

01:22:49.800 --> 01:22:54.680
talking about a future project. We will look into that and do that later. Anyhow, um, let's

01:22:54.680 --> 01:22:59.140
move on. We're going to kind of bring part a to a close here. Uh, getting into the classic

01:22:59.140 --> 01:23:04.880
game of the week. But before we do that, actually let's get into some release dates. Um, we

01:23:04.880 --> 01:23:08.880
like to travel the world and talk to you guys about what is coming out around the world.

01:23:08.880 --> 01:23:13.320
And we'll start off with dark soccer with the UK release dates, whole crap ton of stuff.

01:23:13.320 --> 01:23:19.200
Um, we have on the 23rd follow up three point lookout and then we've got on the 26th, the

01:23:19.200 --> 01:23:25.200
whole bunch of stuff. Another code are a journey into lost memories. Um, Arma two, is that

01:23:25.200 --> 01:23:30.920
it? Um, a dynasty warrior, six empires of fight night round four guitar hero, greatest

01:23:30.920 --> 01:23:38.920
hits blah. Um, monster hunter, freedom unite overlord to overlord, dark legends, overlord

01:23:38.920 --> 01:23:45.440
minions, and pretty, can I really be a hero and superstars VA racing.

01:23:45.440 --> 01:23:55.800
Hmm, cool. Um, let's see, in the US, uh, we've actually got a little bit coming out this

01:23:55.800 --> 01:24:04.400
week. Um, starting off, we've got, uh, monster hunter freedom unite on the PSP. That's a

01:24:04.400 --> 01:24:10.440
pretty good game there. Uh, dynasty warriors, six empires coming out on PS3 and Xbox 360

01:24:10.440 --> 01:24:15.520
this week. Uh, transformers revenge of the fallen coming out on pretty much all platforms

01:24:15.520 --> 01:24:21.280
including two versions on the DS split up between autobots and decepticons to celebrate

01:24:21.280 --> 01:24:26.440
the new movie coming out this week. Um, my healthy cooking coach for the DS and enhanced

01:24:26.440 --> 01:24:31.080
for the DSi with, uh, lots of recipes. In fact, you get some exclusive recipes if you

01:24:31.080 --> 01:24:36.400
have the DSi system. That is such bullshit. It is crap. Yes, it is. I am sorry, but that's

01:24:36.400 --> 01:24:43.080
Ubisoft. You can thank Ubisoft for that. Um, overlord, overlord two coming out on PS3 and

01:24:43.080 --> 01:24:53.440
Xbox 360. Um, overlord minions on DS and overlord dark legend on the Wii. And, um, also this

01:24:53.440 --> 01:25:01.720
week, uh, resident evil archives. That's going to be, um, your first, uh, I guess port of

01:25:01.720 --> 01:25:06.560
the resident evil games. You've got the first game now with the new Wii controls. Um, the

01:25:06.560 --> 01:25:13.640
old GameCube port. And then Conduit, um, the Wii shooter game finally making its way out.

01:25:13.640 --> 01:25:20.880
Fight Night round four coming out on Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3. Um, Spore Galactic

01:25:20.880 --> 01:25:26.280
Adventures, which actually doesn't look bad from, uh, the video that I saw talking about

01:25:26.280 --> 01:25:32.880
the robot chicken stuff. And, um, that's coming out on PC. Uh, Discovery Kids Parrot Pals

01:25:32.880 --> 01:25:38.880
is yet another, I don't know, sim game. Um, I wonder if you can make the parrots repeat

01:25:38.880 --> 01:25:42.880
you in their parrot voice. That'd be kind of funny. Um, the PlayStation 2 is getting

01:25:42.880 --> 01:25:49.600
a bundle of two of the PlayStation, um, portable ports for Grand Theft Auto. Um, Liberty City

01:25:49.600 --> 01:25:56.280
Stories and Vice City Stories bundle coming out for 30 bucks retail. That's not too bad.

01:25:56.280 --> 01:26:04.640
And, um, on DS some more schlock. Uh, Fashion Week Junior Designer coming from 505 Games.

01:26:04.640 --> 01:26:10.960
And, um, Donna Discovery, a real time strategy game. Uh, that's coming out on the Wii and

01:26:10.960 --> 01:26:19.760
I believe the DS. And... Classic Word Games, another one from Ubisoft, also enhanced for

01:26:19.760 --> 01:26:25.280
the DSi. Um, that's coming out on DS. I just think that's a horrible thing to do to the

01:26:25.280 --> 01:26:30.640
casual audience. I, I just, you know, not that these are games I would ever buy anyway.

01:26:30.640 --> 01:26:34.220
I just think that's a mean thing to do to the casual audience. Especially when you're,

01:26:34.220 --> 01:26:38.180
it's not like you're using the new hardware for this. You're, you're using, you know,

01:26:38.180 --> 01:26:41.840
it's just plain and simple. It's all, all the enhancements, um, for like that cooking

01:26:41.840 --> 01:26:47.120
game. It was 20 more recipes and you got to take your picture and put it in as the chef

01:26:47.120 --> 01:26:50.880
picture or something like that. Now if that was the main enhancement then fine. That is

01:26:50.880 --> 01:26:56.200
something that the DSi hardware can do that the DS just simply cannot do. But this whole

01:26:56.200 --> 01:27:02.760
like withholding recipes or game, mini games or what have you, just sucks. Um, Shimagami

01:27:02.760 --> 01:27:12.960
Tensei Devil Summoner on DS coming out this week. And, and lastly, Penya Fantasy Golf

01:27:12.960 --> 01:27:19.160
on PSP will be making it out this week. And that is it. Let's go over to Japan who's had

01:27:19.160 --> 01:27:23.240
a lot of weeks in a row of empty releases but actually there's a lot of stuff coming

01:27:23.240 --> 01:27:27.880
out this week. On the Xbox 360, Blazblue or Blazblue, however you want to say that there,

01:27:27.880 --> 01:27:30.840
is finally making its way out. I know that is definitely being looked forward to by fighting

01:27:30.840 --> 01:27:34.780
game fans on the Xbox 360 in Japan. There's also a fighting stick to match that's coming

01:27:34.780 --> 01:27:38.680
out with that by the way. Fight Night Round 4 makes its way to the Asian regions, not

01:27:38.680 --> 01:27:43.640
just Japan but sometimes in this segment I also cover the rest of Asia. Um, also coming

01:27:43.640 --> 01:27:52.880
out in Japan, Mamoru-kun wa Norawa Ete Shimata comes out as well. Which is, um, it's a port

01:27:52.880 --> 01:28:01.040
from the arcades that, it's a shooter game that looks a lot like, um, Hikaruuga. But

01:28:01.040 --> 01:28:06.760
I don't, I think it's different. More anime based. So, that's a shmup that's coming out.

01:28:06.760 --> 01:28:12.360
Uh, that is coming out by the way from G-Rev is the company that's putting that out. Um,

01:28:12.360 --> 01:28:18.360
also coming out on other systems, going over to the Playstation 3, Agarest Senki Zero comes

01:28:18.360 --> 01:28:25.480
out in Japan from Idea Factory this week. And this is a type of like, it kind of looks

01:28:25.480 --> 01:28:32.540
like a sim type of game mixed with a role playing game. Which could be kind of interesting.

01:28:32.540 --> 01:28:38.540
But that is coming out over there on the Playstation 3. As well as another version of BlazBlue

01:28:38.540 --> 01:28:42.600
and Fight Night Round 4 also making its way to the Asian regions. So it's pretty much

01:28:42.600 --> 01:28:49.920
matches the Xbox 360 dates pretty well. But they also have one other game, Rorona no Atelier

01:28:49.920 --> 01:28:56.440
Arland no Renken Sushi comes out. And that is on several different types of box sets

01:28:56.440 --> 01:29:01.880
and so forth. And I do see that this guy is using like magical sushi in a role playing

01:29:01.880 --> 01:29:08.360
type of format there. So, I think that's gotta be based on some other type of series over

01:29:08.360 --> 01:29:14.640
there. The game looks very stylish though, I will give it that. It looks kind of neat.

01:29:14.640 --> 01:29:21.480
Coming out on some other systems on the Nintendo Wii, Wii Sports Resort, by the way, is coming

01:29:21.480 --> 01:29:26.960
out this week in Japan. That's a pretty big deal. Yeah, so that is coming out in Japan

01:29:26.960 --> 01:29:31.440
and that's really the only thing of note over there. I'm gonna skip past Playstation 2 dates

01:29:31.440 --> 01:29:37.680
and go straight to the Nintendo DS. Fushugi Yugi gets a game on the DS this week. There's

01:29:37.680 --> 01:29:45.280
a Fushugi Yugi game? On the DS this week. Let me see. Bringing up some picture in studio

01:29:45.280 --> 01:29:52.180
to satisfy Dark Sakura. Oh dear god. There it is. Oh, it looks like it's kind of a sim

01:29:52.180 --> 01:29:57.440
type. Yeah, definitely looks like a sim. Fushugi Yugi is two romantic adventures combined into

01:29:57.440 --> 01:30:02.020
one DS card. Become the Miko destined to save a nation from calamity and meet all the handsome

01:30:02.020 --> 01:30:05.880
bodyguards along the way. The fans who have read the manga may already know who the heroines

01:30:05.880 --> 01:30:09.720
end up with, but now with you and the Miko's robes, you don't have to end things the way

01:30:09.720 --> 01:30:13.160
the anime or manga did. That sounds kind of fun. Too bad I can't read any of it. So it's

01:30:13.160 --> 01:30:17.280
kind of like reverse dating sim because now you get to date boys. There you go. That'd

01:30:17.280 --> 01:30:22.300
be fun if that one got a release over here, but I doubt it. And the game, I like the name

01:30:22.300 --> 01:30:28.200
of this game. It's a game called Really? Really? DS. That is the name of it. Really? It should

01:30:28.200 --> 01:30:33.960
be Oh Really? Maybe that'll be the American release and instead of about two girls, it'll

01:30:33.960 --> 01:30:40.080
be about an owl. Although that would be a completely different game altogether. Although

01:30:40.080 --> 01:30:44.400
from what I understand, Scribblenauts has the Oh Really? Owl in it. Sweet. All the more

01:30:44.400 --> 01:30:48.520
reason to buy it. You remember we told Bobby about it. Oh no, you weren't there. I told

01:30:48.520 --> 01:30:51.640
him to go try it the last day and I know he talked about it in his show and I told him

01:30:51.640 --> 01:30:55.720
do lolcats. It's funny. And I guess he tried the Oh Really? Owl and it actually worked.

01:30:55.720 --> 01:31:02.400
So there you go. Quickly on the PSP, I want to mention, memories off after rain comes

01:31:02.400 --> 01:31:11.520
out as well as Noko Aozora Nyakisuko Tenohira no Rakuen comes out in Japan. And the cover

01:31:11.520 --> 01:31:16.480
art is this girl kneeling in the beach, reaching for your hand. It's probably another dating

01:31:16.480 --> 01:31:21.120
sim. Oh yeah, there's two people. No, three people in bed together. What is that? No,

01:31:21.120 --> 01:31:27.000
it's probably a family. It's a family baby. It's not that hot. Alright. Looks like a dating

01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:34.760
sim. Alright, so there you go. The best dating sims have three people in bed at once. By

01:31:34.760 --> 01:31:40.640
the way, the Fushugi Yugi got a big rise out of the chat room. What? Yes, indeed. There

01:31:40.640 --> 01:31:44.680
it is. Alright, hey, we're gonna close out part A and get into part B tonight. We just

01:31:44.680 --> 01:31:50.680
had a mention of the Tokimeki Memorial, which is like the big dating sim series. And yeah,

01:31:50.680 --> 01:31:55.280
there is one for girls. It's called Tokimeki Memorial Girl Side. I do believe it's called

01:31:55.280 --> 01:31:59.480
Girl Side. Alright, well, I stand corrected, but there's so many of those freaking dating

01:31:59.480 --> 01:32:04.800
sims. Alright, let's get into a little piece of gaming history here. It's the segment of

01:32:04.800 --> 01:32:09.520
the show where we have Dark Sakura open up the gaming archive and pick out a game that

01:32:09.520 --> 01:32:13.800
she thinks, you know what, time has neglected this game. Well, not always. Actually, sometimes

01:32:13.800 --> 01:32:17.280
time has treated the game very well. But she says, you know what, we need to take a minute

01:32:17.280 --> 01:32:20.200
from all these current games we're playing right now and take a minute to respect the

01:32:20.200 --> 01:32:27.040
classics. It's called our Classic Game of the Week. Dark Sakura's gonna pick a game

01:32:27.040 --> 01:32:31.880
and share it with you all right now. The Classic Game of the Week. This is a very interesting

01:32:31.880 --> 01:32:36.680
game called Silhouette Mirage. And I'm surprised I haven't done this one before. Actually,

01:32:36.680 --> 01:32:42.240
I think I haven't done it because I thought I had done it before. So, cue music. Yes,

01:32:42.240 --> 01:32:49.240
ma'am, here's some clip from Silhouette Mirage. This is actually from the Saturn version,

01:32:49.240 --> 01:32:55.240
which is the one that I really want most of all. It has really good music, by the way.

01:32:55.240 --> 01:33:03.240
It's a game that's put out by Treasure. And it was initially on the Sega Saturn and then

01:33:03.240 --> 01:33:09.440
had a Playstation release. Well, the Saturn Japanese release was in 1997 and then came

01:33:09.440 --> 01:33:16.120
out in 98 on Playstation. And then Working Designs brought out the Playstation version

01:33:16.120 --> 01:33:22.920
later, actually on December 31st, 1999, which I have that version. And honestly, after playing

01:33:22.920 --> 01:33:27.360
the Saturn version, the Saturn version is better. But that's what happens with a lot

01:33:27.360 --> 01:33:37.480
of Saturn's Playstation versions. Anyway, you basically play through the game where

01:33:37.480 --> 01:33:45.640
you have different sorts of natures. One is Silhouette, one is Mirage. And so you actually

01:33:45.640 --> 01:33:52.880
play as a character that has both of those attributes and can play them. I don't know

01:33:52.880 --> 01:33:57.400
if you can see in the movie file, Rob. Yeah, she's like flip it from blue to red. Yeah,

01:33:57.400 --> 01:34:01.120
when she moves one way, she's red. And when she moves the other, she's blue. That's kinda

01:34:01.120 --> 01:34:08.360
interesting. Well, it's very similar to Gunstar Heroes in how it plays. But you have to really

01:34:08.360 --> 01:34:15.480
make sure that you're the same type of matches, which actually in the Japanese version, you

01:34:15.480 --> 01:34:21.000
can't absorb it, but you can in the U.S. one. And then you also have to make sure that you're

01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:26.880
attacking with the opposite type of whatever the creature you're fighting is. So, it's

01:34:26.880 --> 01:34:32.520
really, really difficult. I mean, it's seriously. But then again, treasure games are freaking

01:34:32.520 --> 01:34:41.360
difficult. So basically, the main character is called Shina Nera Shina, which I thought

01:34:41.360 --> 01:34:47.920
they did something stupid to it in the U.S., so I'm not even gonna bother with that. So,

01:34:47.920 --> 01:34:55.360
she's very little, and she has both aspects to her. And so basically, she is basically

01:34:55.360 --> 01:35:02.160
the one who they're picking to go out and, you know, fight all the baddy baddies. And

01:35:02.160 --> 01:35:11.560
then you have to, you work for a computer called Gehenna that keeps you updated on everything.

01:35:11.560 --> 01:35:16.280
Then you have to fight all of the silhouettes and the mirages and, you know, fight the bad

01:35:16.280 --> 01:35:25.560
guys and make it through the game. And you actually get beings that will help you out

01:35:25.560 --> 01:35:35.560
that are based off the seven deadly sins. Sins. You get sloth, you get lusty, angry,

01:35:35.560 --> 01:35:43.280
gluttony, envy, covetous, and pride. And they help you along the way with different projectile

01:35:43.280 --> 01:35:52.780
type attacks. So, there's also some different modes in the PlayStation one. You actually

01:35:52.780 --> 01:36:00.880
have some other things. You have the Reaper and Galoob bosses that are only in the PlayStation

01:36:00.880 --> 01:36:07.280
version. And so they actually modified the story, added a new dialogue, new levels, another

01:36:07.280 --> 01:36:13.400
ending. And they were intended for the Saturn version, but the rumor is that they let the

01:36:13.400 --> 01:36:20.840
Saturn version out and all that was in it. Also, for the, they made it harder for the

01:36:20.840 --> 01:36:26.520
American version, which I think was really freaking hard. They made it harder. Seriously,

01:36:26.520 --> 01:36:33.360
harder. What you're seeing there, Rob, is easy. They made it hard. I really suck at

01:36:33.360 --> 01:36:40.120
the PlayStation American one. You also have a debug mode. You have Super Core Fighter

01:36:40.120 --> 01:36:46.800
2, which you can play between Shaina and Zohar, one of the other characters. They also, of

01:36:46.800 --> 01:36:57.600
course, edited some of the sprites in the game. Like, one of them, a character's cigarette

01:36:57.600 --> 01:37:03.380
was replaced with a gloved hand, you know, instead of holding a cigarette. And a burning

01:37:03.380 --> 01:37:11.300
cross was replaced with a dragon. So, but that is classic treasure.

01:37:11.300 --> 01:37:14.520
Another treasure to add to our pile in the classic game of the week, but they did do

01:37:14.520 --> 01:37:23.120
some great games. I mean, if you want to look at the things Treasure's given us, Gunstar

01:37:23.120 --> 01:37:34.880
Heroes, Doki Doki Mischief Mage Curse, Bongayo, Ikaruga, Radiant Silver Gun, seriously, Treasure

01:37:34.880 --> 01:37:40.360
is like, they're aptly named. All right. Well, there you go, your classic

01:37:40.360 --> 01:37:44.840
game of the week, Silhouette Mirage, available on the Saturn, or if you were in for a challenge,

01:37:44.840 --> 01:37:54.720
the PlayStation. So, there you go. That's going to do it for this part A of our show,

01:37:54.720 --> 01:38:01.360
but we've got plenty more show when we come back, including our part B tonight. We have

01:38:01.360 --> 01:38:05.880
the rapid fire news. We have some other discussion topics we're going to get into, and of course,

01:38:05.880 --> 01:38:11.120
your emails at Mailbag at OrangeloungeRadio.com. We will be back right after a quick break

01:38:11.120 --> 01:38:20.000
with more of Orange Lounge Radio. Stay tuned, guys.

01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:24.440
And welcome back, everybody, here on this lovely Sunday evening, June the 21st of 2009,

01:38:24.440 --> 01:38:31.360
for part B of Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 328. We tape live every week on AllGames.com,

01:38:31.360 --> 01:38:37.520
available at Radio.AllGames.com, and we put out our podcast every week as well, getting

01:38:37.520 --> 01:38:40.880
back on the ball with that, so you lovely people that listen to us on the podcast can

01:38:40.880 --> 01:38:44.280
stay on top of our show, although if you've never joined us for a live experience, you

01:38:44.280 --> 01:38:47.040
really need to set a date, because it's a lot of fun, and when you can participate in

01:38:47.040 --> 01:38:51.120
our chat room and call in and all that good stuff, Chat.OrangeloungeRadio.com, or our

01:38:51.120 --> 01:38:55.520
telephone, 1-877-GAME-OLR. We have been getting a lot of phone calls tonight, but I imagine

01:38:55.520 --> 01:39:00.880
we probably will later during open bar topics. Anyhow, I do want to point out tonight, we

01:39:00.880 --> 01:39:05.600
have a list list coming up, and the list list question we're going to do tonight, we haven't

01:39:05.600 --> 01:39:08.480
done this segment in a while, I'll explain how it works in a little bit, but for you

01:39:08.480 --> 01:39:12.240
long time OLR listeners, you probably haven't heard us do one of these in a while. It's

01:39:12.240 --> 01:39:16.320
been a while. We're actually stealing the question this week from Kotaku, who had an

01:39:16.320 --> 01:39:19.720
interview with Reggie Fils-Aime, and they were doing this whole little chain question

01:39:19.720 --> 01:39:23.840
thing, so basically Reggie Fils-Aime actually got to ask the listeners something. In the

01:39:23.840 --> 01:39:29.240
same vein of Team Ninja working with Nintendo to reimagine Metroid, what development group

01:39:29.240 --> 01:39:34.720
would you like to see partner and collaborate with Nintendo, and what franchise? So basically,

01:39:34.720 --> 01:39:39.720
to make it short, dream developer, dream franchise, but a Nintendo franchise. We're going to be

01:39:39.720 --> 01:39:42.880
getting into that a little later, and if you want to vote and participate in tonight's

01:39:42.880 --> 01:39:48.800
list list and have a say, Chat.OrangeloungeRadio.com is the place to be. Meanwhile, we're going

01:39:48.800 --> 01:39:53.200
to get into some rapid fire news, some topics that we're not going to talk a lot about,

01:39:53.200 --> 01:39:56.520
but we wanted to let you know what's going on anyway. Dar-Sakura, what's the rapid fire

01:39:56.520 --> 01:40:05.800
news tonight? Well, for our friends over in the UK, if this is actually until July 3rd,

01:40:05.800 --> 01:40:18.240
you can get a gold subscription to Xbox Live for basically one pound. And then, of course,

01:40:18.240 --> 01:40:22.740
you know, afterwards you can pay a regular price if you want to keep it. But seriously,

01:40:22.740 --> 01:40:28.560
one quid for one month, that's not bad. Good way to get your foot in the door. Pretty much,

01:40:28.560 --> 01:40:37.240
see how you like it. Also, some games coming out, WiiWare and DSiWare. We actually have

01:40:37.240 --> 01:40:49.520
Let's Catch, which is put out by Yuji Naka. It's to go along with Let's Tap, so it's catching

01:40:49.520 --> 01:40:55.920
that game. And then we have Ikarian Kindred Spirits, where you play as a little winged

01:40:55.920 --> 01:41:01.760
girl called Nyx, who is trying to find Icarus. So. Aren't we all trying to find the sequel

01:41:01.760 --> 01:41:08.360
to Icarus? Nay, you know, it could, I don't know if it's tied in, but hey, if it is, that

01:41:08.360 --> 01:41:18.140
would be sweet. And then DSiWare gets a game called a little bit of Dr. Kawashima's Brain

01:41:18.140 --> 01:41:26.200
Training Maths Edition. So, it's math. Which means I won't be getting this freaking game.

01:41:26.200 --> 01:41:36.640
It's 810 points, by the way. And then, last but not least, we have Mass Effect for iPhone,

01:41:36.640 --> 01:41:43.800
which is a side story. Actually, there was an NDA leak that came out last month. One

01:41:43.800 --> 01:41:52.460
of the testers blurted out all this crap. So basically, it's not a bridging story, it's

01:41:52.460 --> 01:41:57.240
just a little side story about one of the Mass Effect 2 characters. So, it's just like

01:41:57.240 --> 01:42:06.900
a little fun option game. So, hey. That's it. Well, there's some interesting stuff coming

01:42:06.900 --> 01:42:13.860
out actually on TV. You may remember Penn & Teller's show Bullshit. Well, they are taking

01:42:13.860 --> 01:42:22.400
on JT Voldemort and talking about the evils of video games and violence and all that stuff.

01:42:22.400 --> 01:42:28.760
If you're interested in watching it, the episode will be available on July 9th is when it's

01:42:28.760 --> 01:42:34.560
supposed to air. You were talking about one of my favorite shows ever, by the way. Coming

01:42:34.560 --> 01:42:43.920
to Xbox Live Arcade in Japan. Garou, the Mark of the Wolves. Of course, SNK's arcade fighting

01:42:43.920 --> 01:42:49.040
game and I'm sure it'll probably make its way over here at some point probably soon.

01:42:49.040 --> 01:42:53.900
So that'll be available for 800 Microsoft points as well. And of course, the game was

01:42:53.900 --> 01:43:01.180
originally released back in Japan in 1999 and in the US's Fatal Fury Mark of the Wolves.

01:43:01.180 --> 01:43:08.040
That is the Final Fail Fury title. And last week we had a new Wii game come out and this

01:43:08.040 --> 01:43:15.180
is talking about a throwback to the old laser disc days. But Digital Leisure has a live

01:43:15.180 --> 01:43:22.280
action shooter game you may remember as Mad Dog McCree. They had three games in that series

01:43:22.280 --> 01:43:28.820
and all three of those are available for $19.99 and one new pack for the Wii, Mad Dog McCree's

01:43:28.820 --> 01:43:34.520
one slinger pack, which includes Mad Dog McCree, Mad Dog 2 The Lost Gold, and The Last Bounty

01:43:34.520 --> 01:43:42.920
Hunter. So very interesting and old school crappiness. Another game that's going to be

01:43:42.920 --> 01:43:48.240
heading its way to the Wii as well. Can I say though, those Mad Dog McCree games are

01:43:48.240 --> 01:43:52.800
really trying to bank in on the nostalgia of those laser gun games and how cool they

01:43:52.800 --> 01:43:58.920
were at the time because it was like OMG video. But by today's standards, please. And they

01:43:58.920 --> 01:44:04.840
are $20 for all three games. So if you are really willing to buy it, I would suggest

01:44:04.840 --> 01:44:13.460
waiting for it to really hit the bargain bin. I guess that's a cool value but still. A new

01:44:13.460 --> 01:44:18.680
Monkey Ball trademark has been discovered and I guess based on the title, people are

01:44:18.680 --> 01:44:23.360
assuming it's going to be using the new. God, it just wouldn't be a week if I didn't have

01:44:23.360 --> 01:44:30.960
the wrong music in the wrong time. I can't stop it. There we go. Thank you. It's cursed!

01:44:30.960 --> 01:44:38.720
The song is cursed. Apparently. Much like the game Super Monkey Ball, which now they've

01:44:38.720 --> 01:44:44.020
got a new one coming out, Step and Roll, which people think, oh Step, the Wii Balance Board.

01:44:44.020 --> 01:44:49.360
But hey, who doesn't like to whore out the Wii Balance Board? So that game will probably be coming soon.

01:44:49.360 --> 01:44:59.360
From Sega. And then, that's it. I have a few stories I want to cover here real quick and

01:44:59.360 --> 01:45:03.800
rapid fire news as well. We just started off with the story about the iPhone and Commodore

01:45:03.800 --> 01:45:07.800
64 apparently has been ported over to the iPhone, which isn't much of a surprise. There's

01:45:07.800 --> 01:45:15.120
other emulators as well. But here's the thing. Apparently, Manomio is the folks that put

01:45:15.120 --> 01:45:19.560
this thing together, a Commodore 64 app on the iPhone. They did this together with a

01:45:19.560 --> 01:45:25.400
Danish studio. Apparently, you can actually run this whole thing on your iPhone. But guess

01:45:25.400 --> 01:45:35.180
what? Apple has rejected it because an application may not itself install or launch other executable

01:45:35.180 --> 01:45:41.000
code by any means. That is something that is in the developer's kit. So, they're gonna

01:45:41.000 --> 01:45:43.820
have to find a way around this if they want this app to come out on the phone. Or they

01:45:43.820 --> 01:45:47.660
may have to do game by game or something. I don't know what. Apparently, Space Invaders

01:45:47.660 --> 01:45:53.360
Extreme is gonna be getting some download content. It's Xbox Live Arcade's version,

01:45:53.360 --> 01:45:59.480
of course. Gonna be getting some extra stages and some things. There you go. It's 240 Microsoft

01:45:59.480 --> 01:46:05.120
points. I guess you get some original reimagining of the original Space Invaders and Space Invaders

01:46:05.120 --> 01:46:09.880
2. That's a pretty good price. 240 points for two games and some download content. Not

01:46:09.880 --> 01:46:15.720
much at all. That's not the price for Space Invaders Extreme, mind you. That is the price

01:46:15.720 --> 01:46:21.860
of the add-on content. So, there you go. Also, Splatterhouse not coming out in 2009. Did

01:46:21.860 --> 01:46:25.480
you even know they were remaking Splatterhouse? I mean, we've had a million stories on it

01:46:25.480 --> 01:46:29.600
in the show. Yeah. But it seems like this is the new Duke Nukem Forever. But apparently

01:46:29.600 --> 01:46:35.960
it is now coming out in 2010. Or so they say. I thought Duke Nukem Forever was cancelled,

01:46:35.960 --> 01:46:40.440
finally. I don't know if we ever get the final word on that or not. I think it's still in

01:46:40.440 --> 01:46:44.420
limbo. Because somebody could technically still take the code. Because wouldn't the

01:46:44.420 --> 01:46:48.800
publisher now own the code? That's true. That's true. And get somebody else to finish it and

01:46:48.800 --> 01:46:54.400
call it a done deal. It could happen. It could happen. Alright, we're gonna take some time

01:46:54.400 --> 01:46:59.200
now to bring up your emails. Every week we let you guys send us emails. Mailbag at Orange

01:46:59.200 --> 01:47:02.920
Orange Radio dot com and we respond to them live on air. In fact, that's what we're gonna

01:47:02.920 --> 01:47:15.280
do right now. Dark Soccer, take it away. Alpha Cananagram must have been bored. We got an

01:47:15.280 --> 01:47:24.080
email with the title, You Suck. And then the inside it says, I love Puyo Puyo Wee. Is Puyo

01:47:24.080 --> 01:47:30.640
Puyo on the Wee? No. Wee. When you refer to yourself and other people. I know, I get it.

01:47:30.640 --> 01:47:35.760
And then from MesoSky we have, Hey, I have been noticing that the majority of MMORPGs

01:47:35.760 --> 01:47:41.040
are either science fiction or medieval fantasy. Do you ever think we will see MMORPGs that

01:47:41.040 --> 01:47:46.600
are westerns, 1980s, or even modern era? Dude, we have. There was Matrix. Do you think that

01:47:46.600 --> 01:47:50.520
people are attracted- That's sort of sci-fi. Yeah, that is more sci-fi, but we're in a

01:47:50.520 --> 01:47:56.000
modern environment. Do you think people are attracted to an MMORPG that has been done

01:47:56.000 --> 01:48:05.680
countless times before? There actually are pirate based MMOs. Puzzle Pirates. No, there

01:48:05.680 --> 01:48:12.560
actually was one that I played a little bit of at PAX last year. Where you could play

01:48:12.560 --> 01:48:21.240
a pirate and rape the booty. Um, what about, did they mention Star Trek has an MMO coming

01:48:21.240 --> 01:48:26.000
out? That's Ace or Eve. Oh, it's science fiction. Yeah, science fiction or medieval

01:48:26.000 --> 01:48:31.380
fantasy. Something else outside the box. Anything western? Disney has a couple MMOs out there

01:48:31.380 --> 01:48:37.440
based on their products, but they're a little- You know Disney stars are genetically engineered

01:48:37.440 --> 01:48:41.980
in a lab, right? Isn't there a Pirates of the Caribbean? Yeah, there is. But the thing

01:48:41.980 --> 01:48:46.980
about those games, you can't type text in them. You have pre-determined phrases that

01:48:46.980 --> 01:48:50.800
you can say because obviously they have to keep it family safe. So you don't have mean

01:48:50.800 --> 01:48:54.960
people in there typing fuck shit piss cock unless that is a pre-selected phrase. They

01:48:54.960 --> 01:48:59.440
also have all the adult MMOs. That's true, you can always try to find an adult MMO. Well,

01:48:59.440 --> 01:49:03.800
like the Red Light District one? You're gonna have to face it, the fantasy and sci-fi ones

01:49:03.800 --> 01:49:10.280
are by far the most popular, at least right now. Yep. Last one, and it comes from Marin.

01:49:10.280 --> 01:49:16.160
Okay, ready? It's long. Hey guys, I didn't get to call in, but I wanted to touch on two

01:49:16.160 --> 01:49:21.000
subjects that were discussed during last week's episode. First Rob mentioned that some people

01:49:21.000 --> 01:49:25.200
are complaining about how DJ Hero is just a rip-off of Beatmania 2DX. I believe that

01:49:25.200 --> 01:49:29.280
Rob protested the idea, saying they're completely different. I'd like to think it's something

01:49:29.280 --> 01:49:34.680
like this. DJ Hero is to Beatmania 2DX as Guitar Hero is to Guitar Freaks. You could

01:49:34.680 --> 01:49:41.560
very well say that these two games, Beatmania and Guitar Freaks, are the original music

01:49:41.560 --> 01:49:46.480
games and that games like DJ and Guitar Hero are knock-offs, but I think it's more than

01:49:46.480 --> 01:49:51.920
that. Konami music games have never been widely popular except in their own small niches and

01:49:51.920 --> 01:49:56.140
followings. I think we're fortunate that game development companies like Harmonix are able

01:49:56.140 --> 01:50:01.680
to see the potential of these music games and find ways to Americanize them because

01:50:01.680 --> 01:50:06.640
it makes these games more accessible and likable to US customers. I know about a dozen people

01:50:06.640 --> 01:50:11.080
who play or have played Guitar Freaks, but I only have one friend who hasn't played Guitar

01:50:11.080 --> 01:50:16.320
Hero or Rock Band. Perhaps DJ Hero is similar to Beatmania 2DX, but it will definitely be

01:50:16.320 --> 01:50:21.080
something that is more accessible to a Western audience. I for one am happy that DJ Hero

01:50:21.080 --> 01:50:26.320
is joining the ranks of other music games like Guitar Hero and Rock Band because the

01:50:26.320 --> 01:50:31.060
success of DJ Hero will only bring us that much closer to having an Americanized keyboard

01:50:31.060 --> 01:50:34.680
mania game and I personally will be the first person to stand in line to pre-order Piano

01:50:34.680 --> 01:50:41.240
Hero Elton John. Yes. Who's surprised? I would say, well I was going to say the better comparison

01:50:41.240 --> 01:50:48.720
I think would be Guitar Freaks and Guitar Hero and then probably Beatmania and Kraken

01:50:48.720 --> 01:50:56.400
DJ. Because, you know, Kraken DJ, it's kind of a beat matching game, but it's very different

01:50:56.400 --> 01:51:01.680
than Beatmania. Well, I have my own thoughts, but let me wait until the email is done. Well,

01:51:01.680 --> 01:51:06.200
also I did just get a note in saying that AlphaKananagram says that wasn't him, but

01:51:06.200 --> 01:51:16.440
an imposter. Whatever. Whatever. Okay. Honestly, I don't really care. I thought it was funny.

01:51:16.440 --> 01:51:22.120
Finally, I just wanted to touch on the idea of the new PS3 remote. To make a long story

01:51:22.120 --> 01:51:25.780
short, the idea of the PS3 remote makes me think of the Super Scope 6, a pretty nifty

01:51:25.780 --> 01:51:30.960
idea in theory, complete fail and execution. Take care and have fun gaming, Marin. PS Dark

01:51:30.960 --> 01:51:34.360
Soccer, if you come to Las Vegas from July 1st through 7th, I will give you a dollar.

01:51:34.360 --> 01:51:39.840
Hey, guess what? I'm going to Las Vegas from July 1st through the 7th. You win a dollar.

01:51:39.840 --> 01:51:44.400
Congrats. How about buy me a soda? You should put that dollar in a slot machine and win

01:51:44.400 --> 01:51:48.240
a hundred. Alright. I don't gamble. I'm going to play bimball. I agree with some of the

01:51:48.240 --> 01:51:52.160
email and I disagree with some of it. I agree with the fact that Harmonix has done great

01:51:52.160 --> 01:51:55.780
things for music games over here. Let's not forget they did create the original Guitar

01:51:55.780 --> 01:52:01.340
Hero as well as Rock Band. Harmonix rocks and I don't, you know, they did what Konami

01:52:01.340 --> 01:52:05.780
was too pussy to do basically and for that they deserve to be commended and get praised

01:52:05.780 --> 01:52:12.980
lavished upon them. So thank you. From a music game fan like myself, you have to understand.

01:52:12.980 --> 01:52:17.140
There you go. However, the part I disagree with is the comparison about DJ Hero and the

01:52:17.140 --> 01:52:22.820
Guitar Freaks, Guitar Hero thing. I get that and I think we're, here's the thing. I bet

01:52:22.820 --> 01:52:26.660
that's the same thing we're going to hear on G4 and for a lot of these networks and

01:52:26.660 --> 01:52:33.220
stuff, but I don't think it's a real good comparison. Like, I would use the Guitar Hero,

01:52:33.220 --> 01:52:37.580
Guitar Freaks comparison in trying to describe like DDR and In the Groove maybe a little

01:52:37.580 --> 01:52:43.700
bit. Although, you know, both games were, you know, guitars where you held down buttons

01:52:43.700 --> 01:52:48.340
and strummed the thing in time with it. The thing that's different for me is that that's

01:52:48.340 --> 01:52:52.620
not really what's happening with DJ Hero is that because you not only have the buttons,

01:52:52.620 --> 01:52:57.620
but you have the scratching and the crossfader is really big as well. And it's different

01:52:57.620 --> 01:53:02.700
than it is in 2DX because the whole crossfading leads to a style of gameplay that to me looks

01:53:02.700 --> 01:53:08.780
more like amplitude in a way. 2DX is more, yeah like where the scratching was just a

01:53:08.780 --> 01:53:15.620
replacement of another button basically. Yeah, exactly. And for me, 2DX just feels like it's

01:53:15.620 --> 01:53:20.180
just DDR but using buttons instead of your feet, which is ironic because BeatMania came

01:53:20.180 --> 01:53:24.820
before DDR, but that's really what it is. Like it's just, it's another way of reading

01:53:24.820 --> 01:53:32.340
music in a way. I think a better comparison would be to say Street Fighter 2 vs Tekken.

01:53:32.340 --> 01:53:37.500
They're both fighting games, but they're completely different characters. Yeah, exactly. That's

01:53:37.500 --> 01:53:41.380
what I'm saying is that DJ Hero and BeatMania 2DX, they're both music games, they both involve

01:53:41.380 --> 01:53:45.060
turntables. Well, they're really different. And then also, you know, they're just like

01:53:45.060 --> 01:53:49.300
Kraken DJ, ooh. When games started coming out and stuff, more fighting games, everyone

01:53:49.300 --> 01:53:52.500
was like, oh, it's a Street Fighter ripoff. And I think we're gonna kinda go through this

01:53:52.500 --> 01:53:56.020
phase right now with Guitar Hero and these music games because everyone's gonna say,

01:53:56.020 --> 01:54:00.700
oh, it's a ripoff. But really, it's just another music game. But, I mean, we got into it elsewhere

01:54:00.700 --> 01:54:04.340
on the show though as well is that, you know, now they're charging a premium price for it

01:54:04.340 --> 01:54:09.060
and I think that's gonna be a little bit damaging. Let's also not forget though, one thing that

01:54:09.060 --> 01:54:12.900
is interesting is that DJ Hero is not being made by Harmonix. Something to kinda keep

01:54:12.900 --> 01:54:18.260
in mind. Harmonix is not making DJ Hero. But that's kinda cool that other developers now,

01:54:18.260 --> 01:54:22.300
it's not just Harmonix has to make all our music games. But they, yeah, the other developer,

01:54:22.300 --> 01:54:28.500
you know, is the one that did, you know, was B-Boy. They did that game, which is another

01:54:28.500 --> 01:54:33.720
sort of music rhythm game with dancing involved and stuff like that. But they kinda have that

01:54:33.720 --> 01:54:38.980
whole style that they, you know, kinda brought with them and stuff and their influences with

01:54:38.980 --> 01:54:42.780
that. I don't know, I think it looks cool. I'm willing to check it out. I think you might

01:54:42.780 --> 01:54:51.340
have missed a point too is that she wasn't saying that, um, that DJ Hero is like 2DX.

01:54:51.340 --> 01:54:58.120
It pertains to 2DX in the way that Guitar Hero pertained to Guitar Freaks. Not that

01:54:58.120 --> 01:55:05.700
they're the same type, not that they're the same type of game, but it's, they're different.

01:55:05.700 --> 01:55:13.540
It's the Americanized, improved version, basically. It's tailored to a different audience. And

01:55:13.540 --> 01:55:20.420
newer. I can see that to a point, it's just so different than it felt when we were talking

01:55:20.420 --> 01:55:23.580
about Guitar Hero or Guitar Freaks. Because I think when a lot of us looked at Guitar

01:55:23.580 --> 01:55:27.700
Hero the first time, a lot of us jumped to that whole, oh, it's Guitar Freaks. But now

01:55:27.700 --> 01:55:33.780
that we're seeing, like, DJ Hero, I don't know, I don't see 2DX at all. It's just that

01:55:33.780 --> 01:55:41.300
the basic influence is there. Okay. I could go with that. But I would say it's fair to

01:55:41.300 --> 01:55:47.780
say that it also gets its influence from Guitar Hero, clearly. You know? So I think it gets

01:55:47.780 --> 01:55:51.380
its influence from a lot of different music games. But anyway, I don't know, I think we

01:55:51.380 --> 01:55:56.220
might be getting outside of the realm that Emo was trying to say. However, I do agree

01:55:56.220 --> 01:55:59.980
with the point that it's a great thing that we are getting new music games in the first

01:55:59.980 --> 01:56:04.820
place. And all it took was somebody taking that risk. Showing that Guitar Hero, a game

01:56:04.820 --> 01:56:12.260
like that, would be popular in the first place. So there you go. So does that do it for the

01:56:12.260 --> 01:56:18.300
mailbag? That be it, sir. Arr. Alright. If you want to send us more emails, mailbag at

01:56:18.300 --> 01:56:22.620
OrangeLoungeRadio.com is the place to send your emails. We do have a segment here where

01:56:22.620 --> 01:56:26.740
we read those. Also, we do some interactive stuff through our Twitter. So if you don't

01:56:26.740 --> 01:56:30.740
have us at it on Twitter yet, you should do that at Twitter.com slash O-L-R. We're going

01:56:30.740 --> 01:56:34.580
to get back into some long discussion topics. And we also have tonight's list-less coming

01:56:34.580 --> 01:56:42.540
up. But let's do some discussion first. So Loki, start us off. Of course. So of course

01:56:42.540 --> 01:56:47.580
we know the new trend now with expanding these consoles is kind of reinventing the interface

01:56:47.580 --> 01:56:51.700
and adding new features and stuff. One thing that seems to be very popular, though, is

01:56:51.700 --> 01:57:01.060
web to TV streaming. And with Netflix on the Xbox 360 plus Microsoft's own video service,

01:57:01.060 --> 01:57:08.220
same thing with the PlayStation Network where you can stream movies as well. Actually, apparently

01:57:08.220 --> 01:57:15.220
Instat, a marketing analysis group, published a report this week basically examining how

01:57:15.220 --> 01:57:23.140
this web to TV streaming is consumed by people out there. And they found that the majority

01:57:23.140 --> 01:57:29.220
of it is coming actually from console owners. They said 29% of U.S. console owners between

01:57:29.220 --> 01:57:35.900
the ages of 25 and 34 currently use their consoles to stream video to their televisions.

01:57:35.900 --> 01:57:45.580
And yeah, I can see that. I use it for streaming video and files and stuff like that. Plus

01:57:45.580 --> 01:57:51.100
I've also downloaded TV episodes and stuff like that on there. So it is popular. It's

01:57:51.100 --> 01:57:56.180
convenient. Here's my question. What's the competition besides game consoles? Apple TV?

01:57:56.180 --> 01:58:00.020
Are they comparing it to Apple TV? Or are they comparing it to these Netflix boxes that

01:58:00.020 --> 01:58:06.020
you can buy that are just stand-alone like Netflix devices that I've heard of? Digital

01:58:06.020 --> 01:58:12.340
media adapters, set-top boxes like Apple TV, Blu-ray players, web-connected HD TVs, and

01:58:12.340 --> 01:58:18.500
I guess media center PCs. That's odd that they throw Blu-ray players into that. What?

01:58:18.500 --> 01:58:23.340
I guess web-enabled stuff. Maybe they're talking about like, you know how you can get those

01:58:23.340 --> 01:58:29.380
bonuses on. Oh yeah, like you can go into the BD Live and get all the user commentary

01:58:29.380 --> 01:58:33.220
and all that stuff. I can't figure out. That's too complicated for a normal person to use.

01:58:33.220 --> 01:58:37.660
I'm sorry. But that BD Live stuff with doing all the custom commentary stuff, too complicated.

01:58:37.660 --> 01:58:42.580
If they want people to actually use that, they need to make it easier to figure out

01:58:42.580 --> 01:58:45.180
how to use that stuff. Because as it is, I was trying to figure out how to do that. And

01:58:45.180 --> 01:58:50.820
you have to like go onto this website, put in your serial number, record a commentary.

01:58:50.820 --> 01:58:54.240
Then it would be available on the BD Live, but it's only available to the people you

01:58:54.240 --> 01:58:58.820
put on your friends list that have you on their friends list. And it's not even one

01:58:58.820 --> 01:59:03.220
universal system. It's by company. So like universal Blu-ray has their own thing. Warner

01:59:03.220 --> 01:59:06.380
Brothers Blu-ray has their own thing. Stupid. It's a mess. Stupid, stupid, stupid. It's

01:59:06.380 --> 01:59:10.940
a big hot effing mess. They need to standardize it if they want people to use that stuff.

01:59:10.940 --> 01:59:15.260
So I'll tell you right there, that's why Blu-ray is losing that web stuff. Because

01:59:15.260 --> 01:59:19.480
there are some pretty neat things being done with Blu-ray. Like I randomly bought the WALL-E

01:59:19.480 --> 01:59:23.780
Blu-ray and there's this mode on there. It's like a giant couch basically. And everybody's

01:59:23.780 --> 01:59:28.500
watching WALL-E at the same time. So like you join this giant chat room basically if

01:59:28.500 --> 01:59:33.900
people are watching WALL-E. But it's not really a chat room. They don't show messages

01:59:33.900 --> 01:59:37.180
or anything like that. Because you know somebody would just be on there typing penis, penis,

01:59:37.180 --> 01:59:41.380
penis the whole time. But what they do, they do these weird like polls. Like a little thing

01:59:41.380 --> 01:59:46.220
will pop up on the screen like press this button if you saw WALL-E in the theater. Press

01:59:46.220 --> 01:59:49.740
this button if you didn't see it until it came out on Blu-ray or whatever. And like

01:59:49.740 --> 01:59:53.460
people vote and it shows you the results. These weird little interactive things that

01:59:53.460 --> 01:59:59.180
I think just need some time to be good. It's neat. I kind of looked at it going, that's

01:59:59.180 --> 02:00:02.700
kind of a neat feature. I wish they could do something more useful with it. Well here's

02:00:02.700 --> 02:00:06.860
what I think would be pretty cool is you know how with Blu-ray and stuff you can do full

02:00:06.860 --> 02:00:13.420
Java programming with it. Interactive like board games or like you know TV show things

02:00:13.420 --> 02:00:16.440
like that. Trivia games I think would be pretty cool because you could actually program that

02:00:16.440 --> 02:00:20.940
stuff in there. And you know how before with like a DVD you'd have like some sort of crazy

02:00:20.940 --> 02:00:25.260
menu system and paths and stuff that would go for that. You can actually program a pretty

02:00:25.260 --> 02:00:30.820
decent game. TigerKlonChat says the BD Live stuff is cool. My only gripe is the video

02:00:30.820 --> 02:00:36.260
extras they offer aren't full screen. I see I've yet to even really figure out how to

02:00:36.260 --> 02:00:43.860
get the video extras or I don't know what, oops, I don't know what DVD, what, sorry I

02:00:43.860 --> 02:00:48.780
got distracted with chat stuff. I don't know what Blu-rays even have the extras. Maybe

02:00:48.780 --> 02:00:52.180
I don't know anything about it. Well the problem is I think with the BD Live stuff is you're

02:00:52.180 --> 02:00:56.940
talking about a Blu-ray player you know trying to stream that content. That Blu-ray player

02:00:56.940 --> 02:01:02.180
I mean it's got something to decode you know obviously the data that's on the disk but

02:01:02.180 --> 02:01:06.060
it's not a strong processor. You're not going to be able to compare it to like a PC or something

02:01:06.060 --> 02:01:09.940
where you can just download stuff. And so obviously because of bandwidth issues I mean

02:01:09.940 --> 02:01:14.220
who knows what people, what kind of bandwidth people are on so you got to make it really

02:01:14.220 --> 02:01:19.540
small in order to you know kind of do that extra stuff. I love the idea of recording

02:01:19.540 --> 02:01:22.900
your own commentary to go with movies because I would totally, you know there would be so

02:01:22.900 --> 02:01:27.380
many people that would MST3K that and Rocky Horror Picture Show that stuff but I want

02:01:27.380 --> 02:01:31.240
it to be available like for anybody to go on and access. I don't want to have to like

02:01:31.240 --> 02:01:34.820
add friends and stuff. I really wish they'd centralized that stuff because I love the

02:01:34.820 --> 02:01:39.000
idea I would totally do it. They do. Rift Tracks. Rift Tracks has. That's not built into

02:01:39.000 --> 02:01:46.860
a Blu-ray player. I know. They should. They should. It would be awesome. And I'm being

02:01:46.860 --> 02:01:52.420
told the Transformers Blu-ray has new BD Live content featuring footage from the new Transformers

02:01:52.420 --> 02:01:56.940
movie plus some deleted scenes from the first one that just went released this week. Well

02:01:56.940 --> 02:02:01.580
that would explain why I don't have it because I don't have the Transformers Blu-ray. I thought

02:02:01.580 --> 02:02:09.140
about that. I got it on HD. Ah. There you go. We all got screwed for that so there you

02:02:09.140 --> 02:02:13.180
go. Sg100Matt makes an interesting comment in chat. I'm buying a Blu-ray player for my

02:02:13.180 --> 02:02:16.900
dad for his birthday this week. I really don't see why he would want any of this besides

02:02:16.900 --> 02:02:21.900
I don't feel like showing him how to use it. You know honestly I'm a Blu-ray player or

02:02:21.900 --> 02:02:27.700
a PS3. I don't use any of this extra content. In fact I couldn't care less about like these

02:02:27.700 --> 02:02:31.820
interactive things where I can go on and chat with the producers and stuff. Who cares? It's

02:02:31.820 --> 02:02:36.700
a damn DVD. If I want to chat with producers and stuff I'll go on the internet. Ah. It's

02:02:36.700 --> 02:02:42.620
a Blu-ray. Blu-ray DVD or whatever. It doesn't matter. It's just I'm looking for basically

02:02:42.620 --> 02:02:48.380
the same content that's on a DVD but maybe in a higher resolution or added more content

02:02:48.380 --> 02:02:53.100
added on there instead of having to have four discs or something like that. You know just

02:02:53.100 --> 02:02:59.820
all in one disc. Would be nice. Back to the original part of the story. The whole Netflix

02:02:59.820 --> 02:03:09.500
thing. What is the I guess central part of this? I mean are they trying to say that this

02:03:09.500 --> 02:03:15.460
is just showing that game devices are actually becoming entertainment hubs and all these

02:03:15.460 --> 02:03:21.580
other types of things that will only do entertainment or being rejected? I think they're surprised

02:03:21.580 --> 02:03:27.420
that you know for something that's you know streaming from the web that the consoles you

02:03:27.420 --> 02:03:34.500
know I guess they're saying basically that you know video the television streaming is

02:03:34.500 --> 02:03:38.980
putting pressure on traditional cable providers and will eventually restructure today's video

02:03:38.980 --> 02:03:44.420
distribution ecosystem. They're saying that game consoles are at the forefront of this

02:03:44.420 --> 02:03:49.260
new direction. So basically they're saying you know eventually everything's gonna go

02:03:49.260 --> 02:03:53.980
the kind of you know digital streaming you know that physical media is gonna go away

02:03:53.980 --> 02:04:00.240
or at least that's what they're claiming and that leading the way of this transition is

02:04:00.240 --> 02:04:08.460
game consoles. That sounds pretty cool. I'm looking at some comments from chat. Tigerclaw

02:04:08.460 --> 02:04:13.700
talks about the particular Blu-ray player he has. I have a Sony BDP-S350 which supports

02:04:13.700 --> 02:04:17.500
BD Live. The BD Live only works on it as long as you have a USB thumb drive connected on

02:04:17.500 --> 02:04:21.980
the back. I wonder how many people would even think to do that you know. There's so many

02:04:21.980 --> 02:04:25.740
people that just need it to work right out of the box. The Rob D says I don't know when

02:04:25.740 --> 02:04:29.420
the last time I listened to a director commentary was but Tigerclaw follows that up with I love

02:04:29.420 --> 02:04:34.100
listening to directors commentary so I guess it really depends on the person. So kind of

02:04:34.100 --> 02:04:42.500
interesting. Yeah. SSG100Matt closes this thought. It's a gimmick is what it is. Interesting

02:04:42.500 --> 02:04:46.780
story on Netflix kind of turned into this whole Blu-ray discussion but I think that

02:04:46.780 --> 02:04:50.620
Blu-ray thing is something that will continue to evolve. I think the smart thing that has

02:04:50.620 --> 02:04:56.660
been built into it is funny. It's something I was critical of Sony on earlier. I was critical

02:04:56.660 --> 02:05:03.980
on Sony about this and that is that Sony does not manage to evolve usually and that's why

02:05:03.980 --> 02:05:09.660
Microsoft's beating them but now it appears they are evolving and where it comes to Blu-ray.

02:05:09.660 --> 02:05:15.540
For more updates. That's where it comes down to. So now you can create a new feature and

02:05:15.540 --> 02:05:22.140
everybody can now have that feature. Alright well let's move on to another topic and talk

02:05:22.140 --> 02:05:27.540
a little bit about something else is going on a PlayStation 3 right now. It was a hamster

02:05:27.540 --> 02:05:33.340
versus human dance off in PlayStation home. Yes you heard me right this Saturday this

02:05:33.340 --> 02:05:38.900
past Saturday there was a hamsters versus humans dance off that happened. I just want

02:05:38.900 --> 02:05:46.180
to point out it's not April 1st. It is the middle of June and I don't know what the hell

02:05:46.180 --> 02:05:52.340
this was for although apparently like the winning faction would determine what type

02:05:52.340 --> 02:05:59.260
of free gear everybody in home would get. So apparently like the fedoras and aviators

02:05:59.260 --> 02:06:04.260
would be one if the humans won and if the hamsters won Viking and Valkyrie helmets would

02:06:04.260 --> 02:06:09.900
have been given. Now joystick posters. Sorry I was very loud I apologize for that. But

02:06:09.900 --> 02:06:15.420
I'm just watching this mass orgy of people dancing and some of them look like furries

02:06:15.420 --> 02:06:21.540
because they're hamsters. I think the most important information that we got out of this

02:06:21.540 --> 02:06:26.740
is that there's hamster costumes in home and that's scary now because now there's furries

02:06:26.740 --> 02:06:33.100
in home. Well I think my initial reaction when I watched this video and kind of everything

02:06:33.100 --> 02:06:40.100
that's going on here is what the fucking fuck is this fucking bull fuck fuck. I mean really

02:06:40.100 --> 02:06:45.740
what is this. Is this that what we imagine PlayStation home was going to be when they

02:06:45.740 --> 02:06:51.820
unveiled it at gamer developers conference last year. I mean is this the innovation that

02:06:51.820 --> 02:06:56.980
they were looking forward to do in home. Really. This is just Second Life. OK this is the kind

02:06:56.980 --> 02:07:02.240
of crap that happens in Second Life. It's not that I have a problem with the stupidity

02:07:02.240 --> 02:07:08.980
of the whole thing but it was on the official Sony PlayStation blog and I'm just kind of

02:07:08.980 --> 02:07:13.940
like really. These are the events I have to look forward to in home. What is the fucking

02:07:13.940 --> 02:07:24.540
point. Really. Home being used to broadcast the Sony PlayStation conference during E3.

02:07:24.540 --> 02:07:29.740
That was a great use of home. That was smart. That was cool. And having everybody in that

02:07:29.740 --> 02:07:35.500
place they could view it hamsters versus humans. And it doesn't look like there was a good

02:07:35.500 --> 02:07:42.900
turnout for that either. I mean it's just like maybe 50 people. Well I apparently was

02:07:42.900 --> 02:07:47.740
server by server too. Oh a lot of people. You know what though. You log into home there's

02:07:47.740 --> 02:07:51.460
a lot of people using it. I just don't know what they're doing. I have yet to figure that

02:07:51.460 --> 02:07:56.580
out. Wait waiting in lines for a game. I guess there are some why you have to wait in line

02:07:56.580 --> 02:08:02.260
to play a game. It's a fucking virtual world. You can play the game whenever the hell you

02:08:02.260 --> 02:08:07.580
want. Why do I have to wait in line to play a virtual game. That's stupid. Because it's

02:08:07.580 --> 02:08:11.300
more like real life I guess. Tiger Claw says home is also being used for Q&A's with the

02:08:11.300 --> 02:08:18.780
directors and stars of big movies. Alright that's neat I guess. A little unnecessary

02:08:18.780 --> 02:08:22.540
but I guess they do it in Second Life too. It's a little something more special than

02:08:22.540 --> 02:08:26.100
a chat room because you can actually see the director or the special person in front of

02:08:26.100 --> 02:08:33.500
you. And do the running man as a hamster. Or guinea pig or whatever the hell. Yeah.

02:08:33.500 --> 02:08:39.380
S2100 Matt says why couldn't Jack Trenton talk about this lol. My gosh. Hey this is

02:08:39.380 --> 02:08:46.020
Sony's best kept secret. No not really. Some folks say Rob D says waiting in line immerses

02:08:46.020 --> 02:08:50.300
you in the virtual world. It adds a new level of realism. Zappi says waiting in lines is

02:08:50.300 --> 02:08:54.700
very social. You know I don't know. Well I don't know. It's hard for me to say because

02:08:54.700 --> 02:08:57.820
I don't know what types of things people say on home really. I don't pay attention to a

02:08:57.820 --> 02:09:02.420
lot of the dialogue. But I can't imagine people are going to be as cordial online as they

02:09:02.420 --> 02:09:06.340
are in real life. Like when you're standing in line at Disneyland maybe you'll strike

02:09:06.340 --> 02:09:10.200
up conversation with people around you. Maybe. I don't know. I usually don't because I strike

02:09:10.200 --> 02:09:13.800
up conversation with the people that are with me. But okay we are being social because I'm

02:09:13.800 --> 02:09:18.260
with people. But A in home you don't really have that. You know everybody goes to home

02:09:18.260 --> 02:09:22.260
by themselves. And B when people can hide behind their monitors they do stupid shit

02:09:22.260 --> 02:09:27.180
that they wouldn't do in real life. So I don't think people would say hurry the fuck up at

02:09:27.180 --> 02:09:33.780
Disneyland as much as they would say you know in Sony home. I don't know. I say hurry the

02:09:33.780 --> 02:09:38.940
fuck up all the time at Disneyland. Yeah but you're not really saying it to a child. Well

02:09:38.940 --> 02:09:43.300
maybe you are. I don't know. But yeah I just. What I want to tell some of the parents there

02:09:43.300 --> 02:09:48.220
is to watch your fucking children maybe. I don't know. Just when I saw this whole thing

02:09:48.220 --> 02:09:51.540
you know granted if I don't like it I just shouldn't play it. But I'm just looking at

02:09:51.540 --> 02:09:56.500
this going really. Really this is what home has become. I can understand if it was like

02:09:56.500 --> 02:10:01.100
some sort of thing that like bloggers or whatever decided hey let's do this. This is funny.

02:10:01.100 --> 02:10:04.740
I wouldn't have even reported on it. Yeah. In that case but it was on the official PlayStation

02:10:04.740 --> 02:10:10.380
blog. And I'm like and with a with a little poster markup and everything. And I don't

02:10:10.380 --> 02:10:15.700
know if that's kind of like just giving in or conceding to what home has become. But

02:10:15.700 --> 02:10:21.500
if you want me to have this be I turn on my PlayStation and the first thing I see is home

02:10:21.500 --> 02:10:25.980
and then I walk up to this if I want to launch a game or I have my trophy case and all this

02:10:25.980 --> 02:10:29.580
stuff. I mean really. This is not the way to sell at me that this is ever going to be

02:10:29.580 --> 02:10:34.260
a reality. Yeah well to launch or launch in the home and you know view your trophy case

02:10:34.260 --> 02:10:42.260
coming 2010. It's just. It's on the horizon Rob. You have to understand that the new peer

02:10:42.260 --> 02:10:48.020
use of home. It's coming. Oh well it'll be there eventually. Don't worry. We'll have

02:10:48.020 --> 02:10:53.940
a firm launch date that we won't stick to but it will come. I'm so sorry. How how could

02:10:53.940 --> 02:10:58.780
I ever doubt Sony especially after the amazing hardware that was the PlayStation 2. How dare

02:10:58.780 --> 02:11:07.040
I how dare I be skeptical. All I have to say is bring on the games. I'm kind of glad part

02:11:07.040 --> 02:11:10.820
of me thinks if I'd seen this earlier I would have actually logged in to check it out and

02:11:10.820 --> 02:11:14.540
then once I was there I would have been like what the hell am I doing with my life. You

02:11:14.540 --> 02:11:23.900
know slash rest slash rest. But oh well they need PVP in home or just maybe a game somewhere

02:11:23.900 --> 02:11:29.860
there I don't know. PVP PVP better. It would be cool if like I could actually walk up to

02:11:29.860 --> 02:11:34.420
somebody and it was very easy to start a game but I don't know at the same time maybe finding

02:11:34.420 --> 02:11:39.180
my friends list in a home would be a place to start like maybe a section of home that

02:11:39.180 --> 02:11:43.460
only my friends list can access or friends of friends can access. I would love that like

02:11:43.460 --> 02:11:47.700
a section where I only see friends and friends of friends and then can start up really easy

02:11:47.700 --> 02:11:55.180
quick games with them. So that would be like an empty room with me and Bobby. Pretty much.

02:11:55.180 --> 02:12:00.060
When you guys actually have your systems on. Yes that's what it would be. Alright anyhow

02:12:00.060 --> 02:12:03.180
let's move on I know we got some more news we have list list coming up in just a little

02:12:03.180 --> 02:12:10.620
bit but Dark Soccer's got one more story for us before we get into that. I do. Well as

02:12:10.620 --> 02:12:17.420
a matter of fact I do. And this is actually something that I think is really really cool.

02:12:17.420 --> 02:12:23.180
Namco Museum Essentials is coming to Playstation Home in July which looks like we'll be getting

02:12:23.180 --> 02:12:31.180
Pac-Man, Galaga, Dig Dug, Dragon Spirit, Xevious and a 1080p quote re-envisioned Xevious Resurrection

02:12:31.180 --> 02:12:36.940
which is pretty cool. So you get your trophies, leaderboards, blah blah blah. But it's more

02:12:36.940 --> 02:12:42.060
Namco and that's always happy. But the important thing to note about this is it's in home.

02:12:42.060 --> 02:12:47.740
Yeah it's in home. That's strange. Like so am I going to have to buy this is this home

02:12:47.740 --> 02:12:52.340
going to be the only place I can play this Xevious re-imaging? I doubt it for very long.

02:12:52.340 --> 02:12:56.180
So you buy the game and then you have to wait in line to play your own game that you just

02:12:56.180 --> 02:13:01.920
bought? Surely it can't be like that. Maybe it goes in your own house. That would make

02:13:01.920 --> 02:13:06.400
sense if you buy this game and it goes in the house you own. Can other friends play

02:13:06.400 --> 02:13:10.860
it? Or is it going to be so? You can invite friends in your home can't you? Yeah. But

02:13:10.860 --> 02:13:15.820
it's just so it's like honestly I have to be honest. I don't really know how to do that.

02:13:15.820 --> 02:13:21.780
Like one thing Sony could do is make this whole thing easier. You know what I mean?

02:13:21.780 --> 02:13:28.180
Yeah. Like okay Facebook bejeweled. Tons of people play bejeweled on Facebook right? I

02:13:28.180 --> 02:13:32.020
don't know about your friends, but my friends, tons of people play. You know why they all

02:13:32.020 --> 02:13:37.540
play? Because when one person plays and they get a good score they click a button and it

02:13:37.540 --> 02:13:42.620
publishes to their profile. I'm playing this game. Come play with me by clicking here.

02:13:42.620 --> 02:13:48.580
That's how easy it is. If they want home to be like this central place that everybody

02:13:48.580 --> 02:13:53.020
it needs to be that easy. And I'm sure I have listeners that are like Rob all you have to

02:13:53.020 --> 02:13:57.180
do is open up the menu. I'm like no no no. You're not hearing what I'm saying. It needs

02:13:57.180 --> 02:14:05.740
to be easier than that. If you want more than just the real hardcore gamers to be in on

02:14:05.740 --> 02:14:11.820
this. It needs to be like Xbox 360 where I click the you know the guide button. Go to

02:14:11.820 --> 02:14:17.900
my friend and say invite them to game. Or invite them to my home or invite them into

02:14:17.900 --> 02:14:22.420
my house. Invite to house to see what's up. Exactly. Exactly right. That's exactly what

02:14:22.420 --> 02:14:27.180
needs to happen. So I don't know though as far as the Namco thing goes I guess that's

02:14:27.180 --> 02:14:31.820
pretty cool. But I guess this could be the start of where we really start to see now

02:14:31.820 --> 02:14:39.920
maybe the full intention of home. If you want to call it that. I don't know. The cash in

02:14:39.920 --> 02:14:48.260
on stuff. Sounds good to me. I guess. I'll check it out for sure. I mean hey homes free.

02:14:48.260 --> 02:14:52.780
So despite all the crap I give it. It's free. It's hard to bitch about something that's

02:14:52.780 --> 02:14:56.860
free I found a way to do it anyway. But if I go in there and some of these games are

02:14:56.860 --> 02:15:00.580
available for free I'll check it out. If I have to pay for some of them I don't know

02:15:00.580 --> 02:15:05.140
because you know these Namco games. I'm sorry but how many freaking times do these games

02:15:05.140 --> 02:15:09.140
come out on how many different systems at this point. Like I'm not paying for Pac-Man

02:15:09.140 --> 02:15:14.740
again. I don't know. I think this would be kind of cool. Given some of the things we

02:15:14.740 --> 02:15:20.060
know about this collection. Is this is the same thing I think it is. I don't know. Yeah

02:15:20.060 --> 02:15:24.780
I don't know if it is. I don't know. May I mean there might be some cool stuff but we'll

02:15:24.780 --> 02:15:29.620
see. And hopefully you know the Xevious thing does sound cool. I'll give it that. The Xevious

02:15:29.620 --> 02:15:32.780
thing sounds pretty cool. I want to check it out. I really want to play it. Actually

02:15:32.780 --> 02:15:38.200
I really really want to play it because I love Xevious. Actdeft in our chatroom points

02:15:38.200 --> 02:15:45.540
out Yaris was free too and we all know how that turned out. So there you go. Marin in

02:15:45.540 --> 02:15:50.340
chat makes a very good point. Home in real life is where you're lazy. Home for Playstation

02:15:50.340 --> 02:15:57.560
3 should be lazy friendly too. Exactly my point. And RPGKing7 says it has to be stupid

02:15:57.560 --> 02:16:03.820
friendly. It does. It does. You know if we want our parents and you know some of our

02:16:03.820 --> 02:16:09.460
friends who aren't as into gaming. You know you all know this. You all have a friend who

02:16:09.460 --> 02:16:13.860
thinks video games are kind of fun but doesn't really play an awful lot of them. But they

02:16:13.860 --> 02:16:17.940
might own a next gen system that they you know play Madden or a role playing game on

02:16:17.940 --> 02:16:20.940
one spot. You know what. They wouldn't know how to use a lot of this stuff. They need

02:16:20.940 --> 02:16:26.900
to take I think examples. What they need to do is kind of learn from MMOs and what people

02:16:26.900 --> 02:16:32.220
do in their downtime of MMOs. I think home should add fishing because there's plenty

02:16:32.220 --> 02:16:36.900
of fishing going on in Final Fantasy 11. And you know what. That's something you can do

02:16:36.900 --> 02:16:42.900
by yourself and just kick back. Actually what about something like item synthesis or professions.

02:16:42.900 --> 02:16:47.380
I know it sounds stupid but imagine if you could like make your own shirts and things.

02:16:47.380 --> 02:16:50.040
Within reason like I'm not saying put your own designs on it because everybody will walk

02:16:50.040 --> 02:16:54.940
around with a shirt saying fuck or topless mods such as pictures of boobs and things

02:16:54.940 --> 02:17:00.500
like that. But I'm saying like you know people could collect items in home and then build

02:17:00.500 --> 02:17:07.420
stuff. And then maybe even like sell them for fake money. I don't know. But then I'm

02:17:07.420 --> 02:17:12.580
turning home into an MMO and I guess that's not his intention. But all right. Let's move

02:17:12.580 --> 02:17:17.800
on to another topic and we're going to get into some listless for tonight. And I'm excited

02:17:17.800 --> 02:17:21.980
because we haven't done listless in a long time here on the show. And I need to find

02:17:21.980 --> 02:17:26.340
the music though. Shame on me. I didn't have the music queued up already. We have music

02:17:26.340 --> 02:17:33.340
that goes with listless. And it's a remake of a familiar tune. There we go. The music

02:17:33.340 --> 02:17:37.940
for listless. All right. The way listless works folks if you've never heard this segment

02:17:37.940 --> 02:17:41.500
before on Orange Lounge Radio we've been doing it ever since the very beginning because this

02:17:41.500 --> 02:17:45.620
is a segment I used to do on my college radio show. So it gives you an idea like how old

02:17:45.620 --> 02:17:49.580
this is. All right. So here it is. We're going to take a topic and then we are each here

02:17:49.580 --> 02:17:54.060
in studio going to give our top four for that topic. Yes we've changed things up a little

02:17:54.060 --> 02:17:57.860
bit since the last time we've done this. We're all going to give our top four for the topic.

02:17:57.860 --> 02:18:02.980
And then we will have made a list of 12 between the list of four that both Dark Soccer and

02:18:02.980 --> 02:18:07.820
looking myself make. Then we will each go around and take one item off of the list leaving

02:18:07.820 --> 02:18:13.640
us with a list of nine. Then you guys in chat will vote on the nine. Your favorite. And

02:18:13.640 --> 02:18:17.380
you give us your number one and number two votes. And then we should have a definitive

02:18:17.380 --> 02:18:23.980
list for our topic tonight. So this is how we build definitive lists of answers. Tonight's

02:18:23.980 --> 02:18:30.260
topic we are stealing from Kotaku. Openly admitting it we are thieving this from Kotaku

02:18:30.260 --> 02:18:34.620
but they had a pretty interesting idea for E3 this whole chain interview thing. Well

02:18:34.620 --> 02:18:38.180
Reggie Fils-Aime was the last guy they interviewed and they asked him a question that someone

02:18:38.180 --> 02:18:41.700
had asked before and then they said well Reggie you're at the end of the chain why don't you

02:18:41.700 --> 02:18:46.940
ask something for all our readers. And Reggie Fils-Aime asked well in the same vein of Team

02:18:46.940 --> 02:18:51.580
Ninja working with Nintendo to reimagine Metroid what development group would your readers

02:18:51.580 --> 02:18:59.300
love to see partner and collaborate with Nintendo and on what franchise. So you know let's face

02:18:59.300 --> 02:19:04.020
it Metroid Other M was probably the big big announcement out of Nintendo for us hardcore

02:19:04.020 --> 02:19:10.020
gamers. OMG Team Ninja working with Nintendo who would have thought. So what do you think

02:19:10.020 --> 02:19:16.740
could be the next OMG developer working with a Nintendo franchise. That's where we are

02:19:16.740 --> 02:19:20.220
here to put the list together tonight. So let's start putting that list together. Loki

02:19:20.220 --> 02:19:25.700
why don't you start us off this week. Give us your number four answer. Number four answer

02:19:25.700 --> 02:19:34.700
let me see. Well this is kind of a joke answer so we're going to go with that. Akira Yamaoka

02:19:34.700 --> 02:19:41.820
and Luigi's Mansion. Akira Yamaoka is going so Team Silent or just Akira Yamaoka. Team

02:19:41.820 --> 02:19:45.740
Silent. Team Silent is going to remake Luigi's Mansion that's pretty awesome. How would that

02:19:45.740 --> 02:19:54.500
work. It would be extremely intense but with Luigi. So would Pyramid Head make an appearance

02:19:54.500 --> 02:20:02.740
in this. Less whimsical and more scary I guess. Alright fair enough. Let's see my answer would

02:20:02.740 --> 02:20:09.940
be my number four answer tonight. Blizzard the folks behind World of Warcraft right Blizzard

02:20:09.940 --> 02:20:16.580
would make an Animal Crossing game. So now Animal Crossing really would be an MMO. So

02:20:16.580 --> 02:20:24.220
Blizzard makes an Animal Crossing game. Alright so Dark Sakura what is your number four pick

02:20:24.220 --> 02:20:30.860
and why. God mine's actually kind of related to that the Sims team doing a new Animal Crossing.

02:20:30.860 --> 02:20:38.860
And actually you know make it interesting. Nice we both had Animal Crossing answers back

02:20:38.860 --> 02:20:43.820
to back. The Rob D's chat say no Blizzard should make the Pikmin game. I've also heard

02:20:43.820 --> 02:20:47.580
of Pokemon MMO. Well we'll see maybe they'll come up on someone else's list. Alright so

02:20:47.580 --> 02:20:51.260
we have Team Silent, Luigi's Mansion, Blizzard doing Animal Crossing and Sims doing Animal

02:20:51.260 --> 02:20:55.460
Crossing. Interesting we're only part way in and already two similar answers. Let's

02:20:55.460 --> 02:21:01.700
see if we have more of that. Loki your number three answer. This is kind of weird but let's

02:21:01.700 --> 02:21:11.940
see here. Suda 51 or Grasshopper Manufacture and Wario Land. And you know Suda 51 is the

02:21:11.940 --> 02:21:19.660
you know the mind behind Killer7 and No More Heroes and just like the insane crazy shit

02:21:19.660 --> 02:21:24.140
that's in those games. Put that in Wario Land because you know Warioware stuff's really

02:21:24.140 --> 02:21:34.380
crazy so it'd just be batshit crazy just the platformer. That is insane. That is just pure

02:21:34.380 --> 02:21:41.740
insanity. Alright fair enough. This next one I'm gonna say is my number three pick and

02:21:41.740 --> 02:21:46.060
I picked just I kind of randomly picked Capcom but I think because they've made a lot of

02:21:46.060 --> 02:21:51.300
good like great especially back in the 8-bit days platformer games and side scrolling games.

02:21:51.300 --> 02:21:55.780
So that's why I say Capcom should make a new Kid Icarus game. So they should give us the

02:21:55.780 --> 02:21:59.940
Kid Icarus game that many fanboys have been wanting for quite some time so there you go

02:21:59.940 --> 02:22:05.740
my number three answer Capcom makes a new Kid Icarus game. Dark Soccer your number three.

02:22:05.740 --> 02:22:14.860
My number three is the Outrun team doing the next Cruisin and making that a good game.

02:22:14.860 --> 02:22:20.540
I haven't thought of Cruisin for a very long time. I thought Cruisin was Midway. Is it?

02:22:20.540 --> 02:22:27.700
I was saying but didn't they know that was with Nintendo and Rare. Yeah I think Rare

02:22:27.700 --> 02:22:31.380
had something to do with it. Whatever. So fair enough. You know what we'll let it slide

02:22:31.380 --> 02:22:35.060
it doesn't even matter. So Outrun team makes Cruisin and brings that series back. It certainly

02:22:35.060 --> 02:22:44.420
has memories on Nintendo 64 and all that so there you go. Let's see Loki we're halfway

02:22:44.420 --> 02:22:52.060
through what would you say? Let's see if I should start doing some of my serious ones

02:22:52.060 --> 02:22:59.020
here. The chat room is clarifying by the way it was Midway made it but for Nintendo so

02:22:59.020 --> 02:23:05.660
it was really a Nintendo franchise that Midway made. Looks like I hope I don't mispronounce

02:23:05.660 --> 02:23:15.780
this. Kaita Takahashi and Yoshi's Island. That would be hilarious. And Kaita Takahashi

02:23:15.780 --> 02:23:23.500
the creator of Katamari Damacy and Yoshi's Island. What would this game be like? Touch

02:23:23.500 --> 02:23:39.820
Fuzzy Get Dizzy? Yes the entire game would be Touch Fuzzy Get Dizzy. Nice. Alright let's

02:23:39.820 --> 02:23:56.180
see what we got here. I think Q Entertainment should just give us a new Tetris infused with

02:23:56.180 --> 02:24:06.700
all the music and lights and hypnotic stuff. That's what I want. Sorry for the silence

02:24:06.700 --> 02:24:12.580
I'm actually typing out a list here as we go. Dark Sakura your number two answer please.

02:24:12.580 --> 02:24:18.340
The Silent Hill team doing Luigi's Mansion. I thought you did that. Oh my gosh you guys

02:24:18.340 --> 02:24:21.940
both had the same one? Oh I didn't I thought you were talking about a different game. Oh

02:24:21.940 --> 02:24:29.660
how funny. That's alright. No no no no I'll pick something different. The Silent Hill

02:24:29.660 --> 02:24:36.860
no shoot. I can do another one if she wants to take mine I don't care. No cause I completely

02:24:36.860 --> 02:24:44.580
missed it. Um okay how about the um. There's lots of good ideas in chat. Yeah but I don't

02:24:44.580 --> 02:24:55.220
listen to them. Nice. Um actually okay how about um Square doing the next Zelda game.

02:24:55.220 --> 02:25:02.420
Alright fair enough. Zelda's a beloved franchise but maybe it's time to turn it over and let

02:25:02.420 --> 02:25:06.340
some other people who are more experienced out of it have a crack at it. Square makes

02:25:06.340 --> 02:25:10.500
a Zelda game. Alright so far we have Team Silent makes Luigi's Mansion. Blizzard makes

02:25:10.500 --> 02:25:16.220
Animal Crossing. Sims team makes Animal Crossing. Suda51 makes Wario Land. Capcom makes Kid

02:25:16.220 --> 02:25:21.500
Icarus. Outrun team makes Cruisin. Keita Takahashi makes Yoshi's Island. Q Entertainment makes

02:25:21.500 --> 02:25:26.740
Tetris. Square makes a Zelda game. Let's get into the number one answers. Loki your number

02:25:26.740 --> 02:25:31.960
one answer please. I'm sorry Rob this is probably going to take yours but Criterion Games does

02:25:31.960 --> 02:25:40.900
the next F-Zero cause Burnout is fucking awesome and it just lends itself perfectly to F-Zero.

02:25:40.900 --> 02:25:44.780
Well you read my mind but Criterion Games was not who I actually thought of to take

02:25:44.780 --> 02:25:51.900
over the F-Zero franchise. My number one answer is Sega, Namco, and Nintendo all team up again

02:25:51.900 --> 02:25:57.120
and finally bring us a fucking sequel to F-Zero GX. And yes I phrased it just like that. So

02:25:57.120 --> 02:26:09.580
Sega and Namco once again make F-Zero GX. That's two F-Zero GX's is his number one answer

02:26:09.580 --> 02:26:18.380
so far. Let's see if Dark Sakura has the same answer or something new. Treasure doing a

02:26:18.380 --> 02:26:29.380
new Kid Icarus. Could you imagine how hard that shit would be? That could be very interesting.

02:26:29.380 --> 02:26:36.140
Some runner ups I had. Arc System Works and Smash Bros. Arc System Works of course the

02:26:36.140 --> 02:26:47.500
Guilty Gear franchise. A 2D Smash Bros. game would be kind of cool. Bethesda and Zelda

02:26:47.500 --> 02:26:57.940
and another one that just popped into my head. Kojima Productions and Battalion Wars. Nice.

02:26:57.940 --> 02:27:02.260
No Earthbound I was almost going to say that Square should do the Earthbound game but I

02:27:02.260 --> 02:27:11.820
don't know. Earthbound is very American and even though yes I realize. Square is very

02:27:11.820 --> 02:27:15.060
Japanese centric I just don't think it would meld well. I was trying to think of the perfect

02:27:15.060 --> 02:27:21.500
developer for that but I couldn't. So there you go. Alright well guess what guys here

02:27:21.500 --> 02:27:25.100
it is the list. Now we got to go around and eliminate. This is going to be hard. Alright

02:27:25.100 --> 02:27:30.740
so here it is so far. Team Silent makes Luigi's Mansion. Blizzard makes a new Animal Crossing

02:27:30.740 --> 02:27:37.600
game. The Sims Team makes a new Animal Crossing game. Suda51 makes Wario Land. Capcom makes

02:27:37.600 --> 02:27:42.900
Kid Icarus. Outrun Team makes Krusen. Keita Takahashi makes Yoshi's Island. Q Entertainment

02:27:42.900 --> 02:27:48.100
makes Tetris. Square makes a Zelda game. Criterion Games makes F-Zero. Sega and Namco once again

02:27:48.100 --> 02:27:52.580
make F-Zero. And Treasure makes Kid Icarus. Loki which one of these is not worthy of the

02:27:52.580 --> 02:27:59.620
list? Outrun Team makes Krusen. Awwww. I'm sorry the last few Krusen games have really

02:27:59.620 --> 02:28:08.660
sucked. But this would breed new life. I don't know about that. Alright. I am going to take

02:28:08.660 --> 02:28:16.780
out Suda51 makes Wario Land. Too crazy. It's just too weird. I don't get it. Dark Sakura

02:28:16.780 --> 02:28:22.420
which one of these is not worthy of the list? Blizzard doing Animal Crossing. You just want

02:28:22.420 --> 02:28:27.740
yours to be the only Animal Crossing author. No honestly. Alright fair enough. Alright

02:28:27.740 --> 02:28:31.220
so there you go. Three have been eliminated from the list leaving us with a list of nine

02:28:31.220 --> 02:28:35.460
that the chat will now vote on. Here it is. We'll get to the answers a little later in

02:28:35.460 --> 02:28:40.420
the show. Remember you need to be in our chat. Chat.orangelaunchradio.com and you can place

02:28:40.420 --> 02:28:47.420
a private message to Rob Roberts in chat right now with your number one and number two answers.

02:28:47.420 --> 02:28:53.060
So here we go. Team Silent makes Luigi's Mansion. The Sims Team makes a new Animal Crossing

02:28:53.060 --> 02:28:57.860
game. Capcom makes Kid Icarus. Keita Takahashi makes Yoshi's Island. Q Entertainment makes

02:28:57.860 --> 02:29:02.960
Tetris. Square makes a Zelda game. Criterion Games makes F-Zero. Sega and Namco once again

02:29:02.960 --> 02:29:08.740
make F-Zero. Or Treasure makes Kid Icarus. So we have two F-Zeros and two Kid Icaruses

02:29:08.740 --> 02:29:12.260
on there. So we'll see how that plays out. If they split the votes or what. So remember

02:29:12.260 --> 02:29:17.000
you can place a vote now to Rob Roberts in the chat room with a private message and indicate

02:29:17.000 --> 02:29:20.820
your number one and your number two or it will be assumed that your first answer is

02:29:20.820 --> 02:29:27.500
your number one pick. While we tally that up, we're going to get into another segment

02:29:27.500 --> 02:29:33.340
here. We like to call the F-Us of the week but in order for our angst to build, we have

02:29:33.340 --> 02:29:38.520
to have a story that makes it worthy of us building the angst. And I also have to cue

02:29:38.520 --> 02:29:42.500
the music which I was completely unprepared for tonight. I'm not used to this new format

02:29:42.500 --> 02:29:50.220
yet where everything is in a different order in the show. Anyhow, let's see here. The inspiration

02:29:50.220 --> 02:29:54.220
for this week's F-Us of the week is the downtime that Xbox Live recently had. You might remember

02:29:54.220 --> 02:29:58.060
they were down all day Tuesday. Well guess what? When they came back up, it was not all

02:29:58.060 --> 02:30:03.340
fixed. In fact, some of the games disappeared from Xbox Live Marketplace. Those in the Sega

02:30:03.340 --> 02:30:09.960
Vintage Collection 2. Eh, no big loss I suppose. But the new purchases like Sam and Max and

02:30:09.960 --> 02:30:14.060
Magic the Gathering that had just come out on Xbox Live, you couldn't download them.

02:30:14.060 --> 02:30:20.420
Nor could you redeem codes including your pre-order codes for the Xbox 360 version of

02:30:20.420 --> 02:30:24.860
Ghostbusters. So the PlayStation 3 users got to jump on that and look, all I'm going to

02:30:24.860 --> 02:30:30.340
say is if you're going to take your system down for 24 hours, it should be working by

02:30:30.340 --> 02:30:34.820
the time you bring it back up or don't bring it back up. So stories like this make us angry

02:30:34.820 --> 02:30:54.620
so yeah, we're going to bring on the F-Us of the week.

02:30:54.620 --> 02:31:04.780
My F-U of the week goes towards sleeping for 12 to 13 hours because I lost most of my day.

02:31:04.780 --> 02:31:13.260
Ugh, my F-U goes to Xbox Live Marketplace because Angry Berry is still broken and I

02:31:13.260 --> 02:31:18.620
still amount 400 Microsoft points and nobody seems to be fixing anything. Very convenient

02:31:18.620 --> 02:31:25.180
Microsoft now that you have my money.

02:31:25.180 --> 02:31:30.780
My F-U of the week goes to the fact that I just told people to vote for the wrong thing.

02:31:30.780 --> 02:31:34.820
Sorry guys, yes in chat it's Rob Roberts not Sky. Look three people fixed it all in a row.

02:31:34.820 --> 02:31:40.660
I'm broken and I don't know what it is. I guess I'm going to say F-U to the swine flu

02:31:40.660 --> 02:31:45.180
for reals. I know there's been a lot of jokes and ha-has made about it but I actually have

02:31:45.180 --> 02:31:50.820
a friend suffering from swine flu right now who's in the hospital in ICU and is really

02:31:50.820 --> 02:31:55.660
not in good shape right now and a lot of us are actually kind of scared because she had

02:31:55.660 --> 02:31:58.700
to get put on dialysis this morning. That's how bad it's gotten because her kidneys are

02:31:58.700 --> 02:32:05.340
failing from all the meds. So yeah she contracted swine flu. I don't know where it came from

02:32:05.340 --> 02:32:10.980
but Beth I am thinking of you and I really want you to get better soon. So let's go ahead

02:32:10.980 --> 02:32:14.580
and move on to some more gaming news.

02:32:14.580 --> 02:32:19.340
Yes. Well I tally the votes. My god there's tons of people voting tonight. Well of course

02:32:19.340 --> 02:32:24.380
you would think with the Apple iPhone and the iPod touch you know it's a bit limited

02:32:24.380 --> 02:32:30.000
on what you can do with games on there. So of course and this is actually being listed

02:32:30.000 --> 02:32:37.100
as one of the features with the iPhone 3.0 firmware is that third party accessories are

02:32:37.100 --> 02:32:44.340
going to now be available. And this is actually coming from you know the official iPod touch

02:32:44.340 --> 02:32:50.120
software update page. And so people are thinking oh goody we're going to get controller add

02:32:50.120 --> 02:32:54.460
ons. And so that might be actually what's going to happen because you know with gaming

02:32:54.460 --> 02:32:59.500
being so popular nowadays and really those touch screen controls suck. I mean look at

02:32:59.500 --> 02:33:08.220
Mega Man 2. They need a new alternative so it might actually be an add on. So what do

02:33:08.220 --> 02:33:11.720
you think is that a good idea. Would you actually play with something like this. Sorry I'm like

02:33:11.720 --> 02:33:16.100
tallying cage match votes right now so it's hard for me to totally pay attention but it

02:33:16.100 --> 02:33:24.300
really I think would depend on how well executed it is honestly. They'd really have to do something

02:33:24.300 --> 02:33:31.740
impressive. I don't know. I mean I think it's kind of I guess it's OK. I mean a lot of people

02:33:31.740 --> 02:33:36.220
are kind of bitchy about you know oh I don't want to you know have some stupid peripheral

02:33:36.220 --> 02:33:41.460
hanging off of my you know iPod to play a game but you know I guess you don't necessarily

02:33:41.460 --> 02:33:48.780
need to buy it. And then some people are saying hey now they can do Guitar Hero on iPhone.

02:33:48.780 --> 02:33:58.340
I hope not. That'd be scary. But I don't know. Well I mean the iPhone kind of needs something

02:33:58.340 --> 02:34:03.120
like that if it's really going to be like the next wave in gaming or whatever. You know

02:34:03.120 --> 02:34:08.900
I don't know how seriously Apple's taking gaming right now because I've heard about

02:34:08.900 --> 02:34:14.620
this whole like premium games for the iPhone thing which I think is silly. The games that

02:34:14.620 --> 02:34:18.640
are on there right now I don't see them getting much better than that. Why should I pay four

02:34:18.640 --> 02:34:21.860
times as much especially when there's a lot of great indie games that are ninety nine

02:34:21.860 --> 02:34:32.100
cents or free. You know what I mean. Yeah definitely. I don't know. So OK. I'm trying

02:34:32.100 --> 02:34:37.780
to see if there's anything going on in chat right now. They're still talking about the

02:34:37.780 --> 02:34:41.820
list list tonight a little bit which I'm still trying to tally up. The Rob D in chat though

02:34:41.820 --> 02:34:46.740
says isn't the point of the iPhone 3 G.S. to be better for gaming. I don't think not

02:34:46.740 --> 02:34:52.020
necessarily. How about to be a more efficient multimedia machine. That's what I think. Also

02:34:52.020 --> 02:34:55.300
I'd be pretty ticked off if games started coming out that I couldn't play because I

02:34:55.300 --> 02:35:02.300
didn't have a 3 G.S. I suppose that type of thing is inevitable but I wouldn't be happy.

02:35:02.300 --> 02:35:08.980
Yeah. All right. Well I believe that brings us to the end of our topics tonight. So we're

02:35:08.980 --> 02:35:13.380
going to go ahead and open up the Skype line at one eight seven seven game O.L.R. or a

02:35:13.380 --> 02:35:17.260
username on Skype is Orange Launch Radio if you want to give us a call. If you have any

02:35:17.260 --> 02:35:20.260
type of topic you want to bring up that we missed tonight one eight seven seven game

02:35:20.260 --> 02:35:24.260
O.L.R. username on Skype is Orange Launch Radio. Meanwhile do we have any last minute

02:35:24.260 --> 02:35:29.380
stories or missed rapid fires that we want to talk about. Yeah sure I've got some stuff

02:35:29.380 --> 02:35:33.060
I can talk about. Apparently there's a rumor that Michael Jackson is involved with the

02:35:33.060 --> 02:35:43.420
new video game and no word on exactly what that is yet. But apparently there's an action.

02:35:43.420 --> 02:35:49.180
There's something that he's working on right now. No. Sega involved. I don't know this

02:35:49.180 --> 02:35:58.060
is coming out of it's actually a foreign article nine lives B.E. is the Web site that has the

02:35:58.060 --> 02:36:04.060
information on it. And you know it's kind of hard to determine what exactly they're

02:36:04.060 --> 02:36:07.620
talking about. Let's go to the phones. We have a call. Hi you're on Orange Launch Radio.

02:36:07.620 --> 02:36:13.340
Who's this. Hi it's Ron. What's up everyone. Hi Ron. Well how are you doing. Hey. God what

02:36:13.340 --> 02:36:18.780
con did you go to this week. I didn't go to a con this week. I won't break for another

02:36:18.780 --> 02:36:22.820
three weeks. Are you sitting. No I'm kidding. What's up. By the way this is the last call

02:36:22.820 --> 02:36:29.380
for votes in our list list tonight. What what to what do we owe this phone call tonight.

02:36:29.380 --> 02:36:38.820
I have gone through an official Xbox right of passage. How so. Red ring of death. Congratulations

02:36:38.820 --> 02:36:43.940
I suppose I don't really know how to phrase that but how did it happen. Was it just randomly

02:36:43.940 --> 02:36:48.780
in the middle of the game or what. What happened was this was watching videos and streaming

02:36:48.780 --> 02:36:53.940
it off my computer and the machine kept locking up and I'm like that's not good. And then

02:36:53.940 --> 02:37:00.500
I saw three red rings pop up last week and I'm like fuck I will deal with this when I

02:37:00.500 --> 02:37:05.460
come back from anime next. And then Friday night I find if my roommate he turned it on

02:37:05.460 --> 02:37:13.300
to play Guitar Hero all four rings went red. That sucks dude I'm sorry to hear it. It's

02:37:13.300 --> 02:37:18.700
not so bad because I just got a new 360 today anyway. So what did you do you just went out

02:37:18.700 --> 02:37:23.060
and bought a new machine. Did you even call Microsoft to fix the old one or what. No I

02:37:23.060 --> 02:37:28.580
packed up back in the box with the best I showed my receipt and got a new one. I see

02:37:28.580 --> 02:37:33.300
wait how long ago did you buy this Xbox 360 you had last year. Wow and they still took

02:37:33.300 --> 02:37:38.860
it back. That's because I bought the two year replacement plan. Okay there you go. So you

02:37:38.860 --> 02:37:44.100
actually bought that plan that I think you were wrecking you win or some of our listeners

02:37:44.100 --> 02:37:49.280
were recommending people buy that stuff. And there you go you just got to cash in on it.

02:37:49.280 --> 02:37:55.380
Only downside is that you know since the pro are now $2.99 I paid $3.49 I'm kind of like

02:37:55.380 --> 02:38:00.940
I don't get a $50 credit coming towards me. But I do have a bigger hard drive. Yeah and

02:38:00.940 --> 02:38:07.040
you've had your Xbox for the past year. So you know that's that's the price you pay for

02:38:07.040 --> 02:38:12.460
having something early I suppose. Yeah and what was funny was that when I went to fire

02:38:12.460 --> 02:38:17.820
it up it didn't even have the new Xbox experience so I had to download everything first. Oh

02:38:17.820 --> 02:38:22.340
really that is kind of interesting. Either that I still have like one of the older consoles

02:38:22.340 --> 02:38:26.060
or something. Perhaps but I don't think they're going to give you the top of the line ones

02:38:26.060 --> 02:38:31.300
as a replacement. That's probably the hidden text so. Well I could have asked for a different

02:38:31.300 --> 02:38:38.560
box if I wanted to but eh. Well what happened with it now is everything okay with like your

02:38:38.560 --> 02:38:42.620
save files because like yesterday when I'm asking about that your save files purchases

02:38:42.620 --> 02:38:47.900
you've made on Xbox live. Because I know when I got mine back a couple of my games the two

02:38:47.900 --> 02:38:52.300
arcade games I owned at the time because mine read ring to death after a week and when I

02:38:52.300 --> 02:38:57.580
got it back this is back when they actually had the coffins when I got it back. It does

02:38:57.580 --> 02:39:01.820
this weird thing now it's geometry wars whenever I go into geometry wars like you have to wait

02:39:01.820 --> 02:39:05.980
a second and then suddenly you'll see oh playful version like it looks like you're launching

02:39:05.980 --> 02:39:09.160
the trial and I know what it's doing it's communicating with the server and all that

02:39:09.160 --> 02:39:14.660
stuff but you know. I haven't gone through that yet because I have a friend who has a

02:39:14.660 --> 02:39:19.540
transfer kit so I borrowed his kit and I transferred all my files over from the old drive to the

02:39:19.540 --> 02:39:25.580
new one. Oh because you get to keep your drive okay okay. Yeah it seems that when you with

02:39:25.580 --> 02:39:29.220
Best Buy you know you you bring it in you hold on to the hard drive and they just give

02:39:29.220 --> 02:39:32.540
you a brand new console. I guess but that's the same thing they do with Microsoft too

02:39:32.540 --> 02:39:35.740
I never sent my hard drive back I think it's something to do about the actual serial on

02:39:35.740 --> 02:39:39.660
the Xbox 360. I don't know I haven't played either of those games in a long time either

02:39:39.660 --> 02:39:42.540
so they might have changed something because you know now there's geometry wars too and

02:39:42.540 --> 02:39:45.700
I couldn't tell you the last time I signed on the Xbox live and played joust but I should

02:39:45.700 --> 02:39:51.500
do that joust is awesome so. I should think about that but most of the time I'm just streaming

02:39:51.500 --> 02:39:55.860
videos and stuff off my 360 from my computer because I don't like sitting here in front

02:39:55.860 --> 02:40:02.980
of the 19 inch I'd rather watch it in glorious 32 inch. Amen to that. Yes. Size does matter.

02:40:02.980 --> 02:40:08.540
Mm hmm. That's what she said. All right Rama anything else before we let you go tonight.

02:40:08.540 --> 02:40:13.380
That's it. All right you take care buddy have a good one. All right. Later. Later. 877 Game

02:40:13.380 --> 02:40:17.580
OLR Orange Lounge Radio on Skype. Listless results coming right up but a few more last

02:40:17.580 --> 02:40:21.900
minute stories. Do we have any more? Yeah actually that one thing I was talking about

02:40:21.900 --> 02:40:26.580
the Michael Jackson game he's supposed to be starring in his own game so no word on

02:40:26.580 --> 02:40:31.060
exactly what that is but it's a game that he's actually going to be the lead in. Quick

02:40:31.060 --> 02:40:36.340
question. Chat. Anyone interested in a Michael Jackson game. Would you buy it. Let's say

02:40:36.340 --> 02:40:41.780
you did it. Let's say it's a music game. Hi you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this.

02:40:41.780 --> 02:40:47.820
Welcome to Zaku. Hey Zaku what's on your mind. Nothing much. Just spending a rainy weekend

02:40:47.820 --> 02:40:52.660
here in New York City and just trying to like hold on to dear life as usual. It's bright

02:40:52.660 --> 02:40:56.860
and sunny out here in California although we did. Yeah that's because you barely get

02:40:56.860 --> 02:41:02.220
any rain. We had some. You get more drought weather than we get up here. We're getting

02:41:02.220 --> 02:41:05.900
like soaked this whole month. This is very true. By the way the chat is answering my

02:41:05.900 --> 02:41:12.620
question and almost overwhelmingly I'm seeing if it's Moonwalker 2. Yes. Moonwalker 2. Michael

02:41:12.620 --> 02:41:15.860
Jackson Moonwalker 2. Yes Michael Jackson Moonwalker 2. You might not have heard it

02:41:15.860 --> 02:41:20.020
because you were calling in but I asked the chatters if Michael Jackson is really making

02:41:20.020 --> 02:41:23.700
a video game and starring in it would you buy it. And the chatters are all saying. Will

02:41:23.700 --> 02:41:30.580
that involve like you know Jesus Juice and other sexual accusations. Let's not go there.

02:41:30.580 --> 02:41:35.740
Zaku what did you want to call in about tonight. All right. Basically I just wanted to bring

02:41:35.740 --> 02:41:40.460
up a little gem that I managed to find this weekend apparently. I don't know if you heard

02:41:40.460 --> 02:41:46.500
but this probably make a talk earlier today but apparently these developers were making

02:41:46.500 --> 02:41:51.420
an iPhone Commodore 64 application. We did touch on it during rapid fire news and it

02:41:51.420 --> 02:41:57.460
got shut down which stinks doesn't it. What do you think about it getting shut down. Well

02:41:57.460 --> 02:42:02.220
I guess I guess it's on one hand is Apple's walled garden. You see that they they pretty

02:42:02.220 --> 02:42:08.060
much control what apps make it onto their store and I guess they ran afoul with the

02:42:08.060 --> 02:42:12.900
fact that they're creating something that allowed you to run code which is a big no

02:42:12.900 --> 02:42:19.300
no for Apple. And I can see that bypass the store in itself. Think about it. You create

02:42:19.300 --> 02:42:24.980
an app in basic and like Commodore basic you could pretty much run any any other app and

02:42:24.980 --> 02:42:31.260
the other like music synth you know sit chip synthesizer for example. Bingo. Bingo. It's

02:42:31.260 --> 02:42:35.640
too much. It leaves it too vulnerable. I kind of actually understand where Apple's coming

02:42:35.640 --> 02:42:40.540
from for the model they're trying to build. I guess Sega basically dodged it by creating

02:42:40.540 --> 02:42:46.620
a stand alone a stand alone emulator hard coded for Sonic and Golden Axe and so there's

02:42:46.620 --> 02:42:52.700
no way you would have been able to run an arbitrary code. So I guess if those C64 guys

02:42:52.700 --> 02:42:58.540
want to make their apps on the app store they just got to like make you know drastic changes

02:42:58.540 --> 02:43:03.140
to the point where they have to bundle the games that they license them from. So it's

02:43:03.140 --> 02:43:08.340
going to be one app for the last ninja. One app. Or not even that. You could probably

02:43:08.340 --> 02:43:15.020
make it like one app for several Commodore 64 games or something like that or you could

02:43:15.020 --> 02:43:19.540
sell the other games as DLC. But then you know where it's not going to work is that

02:43:19.540 --> 02:43:24.060
you can't. Now you have to get all the original publishers involved. You know what I mean?

02:43:24.060 --> 02:43:29.380
As opposed to being able to run all your old code. I probably could find. I bet I could

02:43:29.380 --> 02:43:35.180
find my old Commodore 64 floppies and the mass amounts of games I had. I would love

02:43:35.180 --> 02:43:39.460
to have a night. We seriously need to like plan the time we are going to freaking do

02:43:39.460 --> 02:43:45.780
this. Just do some seriously hardcore old fucking school gaming on big televisions.

02:43:45.780 --> 02:43:48.660
Well, we've got the vault.

02:43:48.660 --> 02:43:53.660
There was a lot of classic gaming there too. I mean I don't know if Adam saw it but yeah

02:43:53.660 --> 02:44:01.500
there was pretty much a 2600, two NES's, one with Duck Hunt running, an old Neo Geo cabinet

02:44:01.500 --> 02:44:05.660
and just like really old school consoles right there in one particular room out of six game

02:44:05.660 --> 02:44:07.060
rooms that weekend.

02:44:07.060 --> 02:44:11.020
I really want to figure out. Maybe we could do this at a con or something tag on to some

02:44:11.020 --> 02:44:15.800
con. I want to broadcast it and I want to marathon obscure classic games. I don't want

02:44:15.800 --> 02:44:19.860
to do like Mario Brothers and all that. It's some type of charity thing but it's all obscure

02:44:19.860 --> 02:44:24.740
shit like stuff that you may not have played before like Impossible Mission or other conversation

02:44:24.740 --> 02:44:25.740
for years.

02:44:25.740 --> 02:44:28.120
What about that Penn and Teller game? That Penn and Teller game where you just drive

02:44:28.120 --> 02:44:29.540
on a bus for hours.

02:44:29.540 --> 02:44:34.900
Yeah but let's face it. The joke is that the game is stupid. I don't want to do something

02:44:34.900 --> 02:44:35.900
like that.

02:44:35.900 --> 02:44:38.140
No but seriously you could actually do a charity thing.

02:44:38.140 --> 02:44:41.820
Go through our own classic game of the week archive and pick like ten of those obscure

02:44:41.820 --> 02:44:44.100
games and play those.

02:44:44.100 --> 02:44:48.700
I had my share of obscure games and I had my NES so I pretty much have a good pick.

02:44:48.700 --> 02:44:54.580
Zeba says at PAX please. Dude if we could get a room at PAX somehow like that I would

02:44:54.580 --> 02:44:58.400
love that except we're probably not big enough but I never thought about it either.

02:44:58.400 --> 02:45:03.860
You have to start with the con at the con level since that's pretty much your domain

02:45:03.860 --> 02:45:08.420
at the moment. PAX is kind of like major. It's like a major indie thing. It's kind of

02:45:08.420 --> 02:45:12.500
like the E3 of indie games.

02:45:12.500 --> 02:45:16.620
I agree we need to piggyback on a con somewhere. Maybe I need to talk to the SacAnime people.

02:45:16.620 --> 02:45:22.060
We'll see. We need to do a lock in. We need to rent the Masonic Lodge for a weekend and

02:45:22.060 --> 02:45:23.540
do a lock in. That would be cool.

02:45:23.540 --> 02:45:26.500
Alright Zaku we're going to let you go so we can get some more comments but thank you

02:45:26.500 --> 02:45:28.060
you have a good one buddy.

02:45:28.060 --> 02:45:29.820
Yeah have a good weekend man.

02:45:29.820 --> 02:45:30.820
Later.

02:45:30.820 --> 02:45:34.580
Rama says I need to book a room for OLR at PAX East. Yes you do because guess what Rama

02:45:34.580 --> 02:45:40.060
I'm coming. I want to go to PAX East so make it happen.

02:45:40.060 --> 02:45:43.260
Okay do we have more last minute stories? I'm sorry 877 game OLR we can do like one

02:45:43.260 --> 02:45:44.780
more call probably.

02:45:44.780 --> 02:45:52.220
Yeah there's some interesting stuff. They're doing a new Mega Man EXE game. Mega Man EXE

02:45:52.220 --> 02:45:56.780
Operator Shooting Star and what's interesting though is it's going to be kind of a cross

02:45:56.780 --> 02:46:03.620
game with Mega Man ZX as well. So you've got ZX and the EXE universe kind of crossing into

02:46:03.620 --> 02:46:11.540
a brand new game and that was announced in Japan. And then finally there's a new record

02:46:11.540 --> 02:46:18.580
being broken. The Frogger score held by fictional character George Costanda is going to be challenged

02:46:18.580 --> 02:46:19.580
I guess this weekend.

02:46:19.580 --> 02:46:23.260
Hmm interesting. We got a call. You're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this?

02:46:23.260 --> 02:46:25.540
This is RPG King 7.

02:46:25.540 --> 02:46:29.660
RPG King 7. Are you truly the king of RPGs?

02:46:29.660 --> 02:46:32.420
I like to think I'm the seventh in line. There are guys above me.

02:46:32.420 --> 02:46:35.980
Have you played this Final Fantasy 4 after years? That's what I'm all the rage about

02:46:35.980 --> 02:46:36.980
right now.

02:46:36.980 --> 02:46:39.940
No not yet. I don't have a Wii so.

02:46:39.940 --> 02:46:42.940
Oh my gosh. You've got to figure out a way to play it though.

02:46:42.940 --> 02:46:46.100
My parents have a Wii so I'll probably get it.

02:46:46.100 --> 02:46:49.620
There you go. I know you probably called in to talk about something else but I've got

02:46:49.620 --> 02:46:52.980
to ask you a question because I want to talk about after years with somebody and you're

02:46:52.980 --> 02:46:56.460
the best thing I've got because you're at least RPG King. Did you hear the story about

02:46:56.460 --> 02:46:59.940
the whole Chrono Trigger fan project getting shut down?

02:46:59.940 --> 02:47:02.660
Oh my god you're reading my mind. That's exactly what I wanted to bring up.

02:47:02.660 --> 02:47:06.100
Ah okay then you say your thing and then I'll say mine.

02:47:06.100 --> 02:47:10.780
Well I was wondering you know why isn't the convention and bring up that they they were

02:47:10.780 --> 02:47:15.260
like practically complete and then Square struck them down. I'm wondering what do you

02:47:15.260 --> 02:47:19.780
what do you guys think Square is being so anal about it whereas there's like a million

02:47:19.780 --> 02:47:24.020
Mario and other fan projects and the other publishers haven't said boo.

02:47:24.020 --> 02:47:27.820
Ah ah you read my mind because because and I have the answer this is what I was going

02:47:27.820 --> 02:47:36.200
to ask you about okay because this Final Fantasy 4 after years is that Chrono Trigger fan project.

02:47:36.200 --> 02:47:43.900
It is a re-skinned remapped enhanced slightly version of Final Fantasy 4 but with the text

02:47:43.900 --> 02:47:48.500
hack to be a new story with some new sprites and some new music put in. Now granted I probably

02:47:48.500 --> 02:47:51.460
shouldn't label this thing a hack. I mean obviously there's more to it than that but

02:47:51.460 --> 02:47:55.780
that type of thing that they did with Chrono Trigger those fans is what they're trying

02:47:55.780 --> 02:48:01.180
to do with the this after years project. So my thought is if this after years thing is

02:48:01.180 --> 02:48:06.100
successful and I think a lot of people were thinking what how rude of Square to shut down

02:48:06.100 --> 02:48:09.940
this project. Where was the harm going to be? What were they doing? Well yeah like even

02:48:09.940 --> 02:48:14.500
that sorry I just want to jump into that other project that was a few years ago where they

02:48:14.500 --> 02:48:20.220
built up a 3D version of it from the ground up and they Square cut them off pretty early.

02:48:20.220 --> 02:48:24.620
That wasn't that long ago I remember that though. Again I think protecting their rights

02:48:24.620 --> 02:48:29.740
because Square's been doing all these remakes on the DS that are in 3D so maybe they want

02:48:29.740 --> 02:48:37.940
to do something like that I don't know. But yeah I think they're doing it because they

02:48:37.940 --> 02:48:42.420
they they don't want to shut the door on the possibility to do that stuff later on.

02:48:42.420 --> 02:48:49.100
Yeah because I remember years and years ago they copyrighted the name Chrono Break and

02:48:49.100 --> 02:48:54.260
people were thinking oh man they're going to do Chrono Trigger but you know they haven't

02:48:54.260 --> 02:49:00.620
done anything. I don't know maybe it's going to be the ace in the hole or whatever but

02:49:00.620 --> 02:49:04.860
I know the fans are getting restless. Why are they continuing to shut down all these

02:49:04.860 --> 02:49:08.500
projects if they're not going to do anything with the Chrono Trigger franchise? I don't

02:49:08.500 --> 02:49:14.180
know. Yeah I mean look at Nintendo they had their whole fan project that did Earthbound

02:49:14.180 --> 02:49:20.580
or Mother 3 and it looks like we're never ever going to get that. I know it's sad it's

02:49:20.580 --> 02:49:24.340
very sad and I wish I wish we would because Earthbound's a fun series but and they could

02:49:24.340 --> 02:49:28.340
put it on WiiWare like that it would be so easy but for whatever reason they just don't

02:49:28.340 --> 02:49:33.420
want to do it. Sorry I didn't mean to catch up. No it's okay. I was saying that you know

02:49:33.420 --> 02:49:38.020
the whole DSiWare and one of the speculations I remember hearing was that you know they'll

02:49:38.020 --> 02:49:42.300
put the old Gameboy and Gateway Dance games on there. They put Earthbound 3 on there they'll

02:49:42.300 --> 02:49:47.780
get a huge number of people buying that up. Yeah but hopefully they're just not afraid

02:49:47.780 --> 02:49:51.060
of like you know and I remember hearing an argument before that there's too much parody

02:49:51.060 --> 02:49:53.900
in there that they're worried about getting sued or something like that I just I hope

02:49:53.900 --> 02:49:58.220
they just get over that whatever that is. It's a freaking video game. People need to

02:49:58.220 --> 02:50:01.860
get over it. Alright well RPG King we gotta let you go to get some more calls but do you

02:50:01.860 --> 02:50:07.100
have any other final thoughts for our listeners? No it's just keep the RPG love alive. Alright

02:50:07.100 --> 02:50:11.740
we will try our best. Okay thanks. Alright take care. Yeah the less I play MMOs the more

02:50:11.740 --> 02:50:18.860
I can play RPGs so I will do my best. We can probably get one more call in 1877 Game OLR

02:50:18.860 --> 02:50:25.260
or Orange Launch Radio on Skype but really really one more call. Um Loki. Anyways as

02:50:25.260 --> 02:50:31.300
I was saying George Costanza from Seinfeld his fictional Frogger high score is gonna

02:50:31.300 --> 02:50:38.300
be challenged this weekend for whatever reason I don't know. Um also apparently Nintendo

02:50:38.300 --> 02:50:43.880
had another handheld system that they finished however they're not gonna release it because

02:50:43.880 --> 02:50:48.620
apparently in the history of Nintendo there are such um or there are several examples

02:50:48.620 --> 02:50:53.240
of such devices like this but when we are launching new hardware the most important

02:50:53.240 --> 02:50:58.940
thing is to sustain the momentum and if introducing new hardware won't do anything to do that

02:50:58.940 --> 02:51:04.780
well. So uh let me go to the phones. Hi you're on Orange Launch Radio who's this? Hey it's

02:51:04.780 --> 02:51:08.820
Sturlok. Hi Sturlok what's on your mind tonight buddy? Eh not a whole lot didn't think you

02:51:08.820 --> 02:51:13.820
guys were doing a show tonight. Surprise why wouldn't we do a show tonight? I thought last

02:51:13.820 --> 02:51:18.380
week you said something about being back in two weeks. You know what our anniversary show

02:51:18.380 --> 02:51:22.240
is in two weeks I think that well maybe that explains our dip in listeners tonight I don't

02:51:22.240 --> 02:51:27.120
know but no our anniversary show is in two weeks. Yeah well plus it's Father's Day so

02:51:27.120 --> 02:51:30.740
people are probably out doing stuff. True but you know I think those of us that you

02:51:30.740 --> 02:51:34.940
know needed to take care of business already did so we you know did that earlier today.

02:51:34.940 --> 02:51:38.560
So what's on your mind to uh what what are you thinking about tonight's show any topics

02:51:38.560 --> 02:51:43.560
you want to bring up? Um I actually just uh tuned in um but I actually wanted to bring

02:51:43.560 --> 02:51:51.920
this up last week about the whole Crimson Echoes thing um it's it's kind of ironic because

02:51:51.920 --> 02:51:58.100
uh you know you brought up a month or three which is I think one of the better RPGs you

02:51:58.100 --> 02:52:05.340
know ever made recently. Um but anyway there was a fan game um it was kind of a prequel

02:52:05.340 --> 02:52:15.180
to uh Earthbound and it's you know a full RPG um it's granted it's not a rom hack it's

02:52:15.180 --> 02:52:22.100
a you know it was done in like RPG Maker or something but you know it looks halfway decent

02:52:22.100 --> 02:52:26.860
and you know it uses a bunch of music and sound effects from Earthbound and you know

02:52:26.860 --> 02:52:31.700
you don't see Nintendo getting all you know butthurt over it. It's kind of interesting

02:52:31.700 --> 02:52:35.620
to see where these companies will draw the line because if you think about it Square

02:52:35.620 --> 02:52:41.620
I mean how much different is these type of rom hacks and so forth well okay I get it

02:52:41.620 --> 02:52:44.700
because it's a rom hack but some of these other fan projects like maybe things that

02:52:44.700 --> 02:52:48.980
aren't necessarily rom hacks but games let's say built in RPG Maker from the ground up

02:52:48.980 --> 02:52:55.420
or what have you they're basically enhanced fan fiction. Exactly. It's what it is I mean

02:52:55.420 --> 02:52:59.760
it's it's no different than logging on to a Harry Potter forum and reading the stories

02:52:59.760 --> 02:53:06.400
people have invented. Yeah or like you know if you were going to buy go by Squares logic

02:53:06.400 --> 02:53:14.340
you know fanfiction.net would not exist. I don't know it's kind of ridiculous in my opinion

02:53:14.340 --> 02:53:21.180
but maybe the problem that they have at Square is the rom hack element of it but then again

02:53:21.180 --> 02:53:25.300
I guess you know but they also have a 3D. But they made it they made they did try to

02:53:25.300 --> 02:53:30.700
make it perfectly clear that the rom image itself would not be included in this thing

02:53:30.700 --> 02:53:36.540
it was just a patch just like the mother 3 translation was just a patch you you have

02:53:36.540 --> 02:53:41.940
to attain the the rom yourself. But maybe it was just the whole fact that it was encouraging

02:53:41.940 --> 02:53:47.660
the altercation of an intellectual property of Square. Yeah. Don't get me wrong I think

02:53:47.660 --> 02:53:51.540
the whole thing's a little silly and I don't think they stood to lose anything at all but

02:53:51.540 --> 02:53:55.500
maybe they just don't want someone out there competing with themselves because I didn't

02:53:55.500 --> 02:53:59.340
it didn't make sense to me until I played Final Fantasy IV the after years. I know what

02:53:59.340 --> 02:54:03.700
you mean that you when you brought that up I was like wow shit that's a really good point

02:54:03.700 --> 02:54:09.820
yeah that's kind of what that is. Exactly I know I know it didn't hit me until I played

02:54:09.820 --> 02:54:16.540
that and then I was like oh I get the lawsuit now. Yeah. So all right well hey thank you

02:54:16.540 --> 02:54:20.100
so much for the call we're gonna let you go so we can wrap up the show but we'll see you

02:54:20.100 --> 02:54:23.900
next week we will be here next week just so you know it's a big show for us. Yeah. All

02:54:23.900 --> 02:54:27.660
right we'll see you then. All right see you later. All right we're gonna go ahead and

02:54:27.660 --> 02:54:30.820
close up the skype line thank you guys so much for calling in but I keep cutting Loki

02:54:30.820 --> 02:54:35.860
off every time he tries to finish the story because. And it's very rude. I'm sorry but

02:54:35.860 --> 02:54:39.180
you know the callers we want to want them to be heard and I don't like them being on

02:54:39.180 --> 02:54:42.580
hold for 30 minutes because then we hear all their background noise and some of them will

02:54:42.580 --> 02:54:50.580
start going hello hello and you're trying to do a thing so we try to get to them quickly.

02:54:50.580 --> 02:54:57.300
Yeah. All right. Rock band the metal track pack apparently some achievements have leaked

02:54:57.300 --> 02:55:02.260
out some of the songs included with that that are actually not released yet because you

02:55:02.260 --> 02:55:07.780
know with the country track pack they did 13 new tracks in there and they're of course

02:55:07.780 --> 02:55:12.500
some were you know already released but there's some new tracks as well. Same with the metal

02:55:12.500 --> 02:55:17.220
track pack which is coming later this year and some of the songs include with that Motorhead

02:55:17.220 --> 02:55:25.300
Killed by Death Hawk Wind Master of the Universe Blue Oyster Cult looks like a trans maniac

02:55:25.300 --> 02:55:32.980
on MC and Nazareth Hair of the Dog. So that's four songs you can look to look forward to

02:55:32.980 --> 02:55:37.480
on rock band that haven't come out yet and probably will come out after the metal track

02:55:37.480 --> 02:55:50.780
pack on the rock band store. And not really a story but Arma 2 looks awesome. That was

02:55:50.780 --> 02:55:54.940
the one you were showing me with the plane. That was the one it's it's like it's it's

02:55:54.940 --> 02:56:03.660
done by the same people they're doing Operation Dragon or was it Operation what was it now

02:56:03.660 --> 02:56:10.900
Operation Flashpoint 2 Dragon Rising but they have another game coming out actually next

02:56:10.900 --> 02:56:17.860
week on PC Arma 2 with they've got tons of AI that are fighting this like war that you're

02:56:17.860 --> 02:56:22.860
actually just part of and a really detailed kind of open world Call of Duty type of game

02:56:22.860 --> 02:56:27.980
but it's got you know little funny things in there like there's a sniper on a on an

02:56:27.980 --> 02:56:32.740
airfield and this plane was taking off and the plane saw the sniper and so it veered

02:56:32.740 --> 02:56:37.580
to the left really quick and just crashed into the trees which is kind of funny so the

02:56:37.580 --> 02:56:41.200
game needs to be bug tested maybe a little bit but hey you should post that YouTube in

02:56:41.200 --> 02:56:45.580
chat because it is it's pretty funny yeah so do that sorry to the podcast listeners

02:56:45.580 --> 02:56:51.980
you don't get to see that but you search for it on YouTube Arma 2 and I'm trying to find

02:56:51.980 --> 02:56:57.700
