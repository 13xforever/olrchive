00:00.000 --> 00:20.320
Today, June 7th, 2009, we're all here in studio with your phone calls and chat romantics to

00:20.320 --> 00:31.680
discuss this year's highs and lows of E3.

00:31.680 --> 00:36.480
Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

00:36.480 --> 00:42.480
We are that talk show dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer

00:42.480 --> 00:47.760
lifestyle. My name is Rob Roberts, here with you every week. Also say hello to my wonderful co-host,

00:47.760 --> 00:54.560
the one and only Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers. Yo. How are you doing? I am doing okay. I was a little

00:54.560 --> 00:57.760
worried you weren't going to be here tonight at first, but things pulled through and now you're

00:57.760 --> 01:03.280
here. I thought that I had a school orientation and it turns out that I don't. Well that's a good

01:03.280 --> 01:06.560
thing though, right? That means I have it next week. Now you can sit here and party with us.

01:07.120 --> 01:12.720
Yep, it's all parties all the time. All right, or you can play Sims 3. Hey, I can do both at the

01:12.720 --> 01:16.320
same time. All right, no that's fine. All right, also say hello to the one and only Tech Master

01:16.320 --> 01:21.200
Loki. Hello. All right, and Loki's able to do the show and look at porn at the same time. It's

01:21.200 --> 01:26.560
amazing. No, I'm just kidding. Are you looking at porn? Although my wife is adding bookmarks for

01:26.560 --> 01:34.080
porn on my computer, I like to add. Nice. How very, how very thoughtful of her. So, all right,

01:34.080 --> 01:37.840
well how you doing today, Loki? You just, you just got back from LA today, right? Yeah, like

01:38.640 --> 01:44.000
four hours ago. Most people leave E3 like Friday, but you, you stayed over till today to do stuff

01:44.000 --> 01:50.560
with the wife. Yes, and that reminds me, she wanted me to add a few things about E3. She says

01:50.560 --> 01:56.480
E3 sucked because she had to stay in the hotel room, and because the people in the hotel room

01:56.480 --> 02:00.720
had open wi-fi, but for whatever reason she couldn't connect to them, so she couldn't

02:00.720 --> 02:05.120
download the porn fast enough, and then she was also pissed off at my computer because it didn't

02:05.120 --> 02:09.760
have Yahoo Instant Messenger installed on it anymore. That's because it, a Windows update

02:09.760 --> 02:15.280
crashed and I had to reinstall the whole thing. So, that's her complaint about that. Oh, and

02:15.280 --> 02:20.800
Universal sucks, because we went to Universal Studios, and they have no rides, but they have

02:20.800 --> 02:25.840
a tour that apparently wants to abort your baby, and then they also have- Whoa, whoa, whoa, Nelly's

02:25.840 --> 02:30.400
pregnant, so I take a comment like that pretty seriously. Well, it's because the tram rides,

02:30.400 --> 02:36.080
like, it's brutal. The tram rides worsen, like, some of the roller coasters that you go on,

02:36.080 --> 02:40.320
because it's just, like, they have, like, no shocks or suspension on that thing. Did you happen to see

02:40.320 --> 02:46.240
the premiere of Conan O'Brien taking over the Tonight Show, where he did the circling of the

02:46.240 --> 02:49.920
trams? That's like the Mario thing. Oh, yeah, the circling of the trams. The Mario thing was later

02:49.920 --> 02:53.040
in the week. Yeah, he took over. Maybe it was the second night. I don't know. I actually watched

02:53.040 --> 02:56.720
every week, every night of Conan O'Brien this week. I saw the sign to go in there, and I was like,

02:56.720 --> 03:00.880
oh, I want to go in there, but we couldn't, so. What day were you at Universal Studios? We were

03:00.880 --> 03:04.880
there Thursday afternoon. We went there Friday. It's like we kept missing each other the next

03:04.880 --> 03:11.200
few days. That's all right. Well, yeah, Universal Studios sucks. Sorry to hear. I've never been

03:11.200 --> 03:15.520
there. I've never been there. I thought they had, like, a Jurassic Park ride and a Simpsons ride.

03:15.520 --> 03:20.880
Yeah, and a pregnant woman can't ride, and the Simpsons ride pregnant people can't ride that

03:20.880 --> 03:25.520
either. Pregnant women can't ride a lot. I hate to break it to you. I know, but, you know, violent

03:25.520 --> 03:30.960
motions shaking around your belly are not good for twins. Yes, but beside that, though, I mean,

03:30.960 --> 03:35.520
they really only have four rides. They have the Jurassic Park ride, the Mummy Returns ride or

03:35.520 --> 03:44.240
whatever. They have, uh, the Simpsons ride, and there's maybe one other one. I'm not sure,

03:44.240 --> 03:48.480
but that's all they have at Great Am- or at, not Great America. Universal, I mean, come on,

03:48.480 --> 03:53.600
for a theme park, that's pretty shitty. I mean, my only bitch is that Universal City Walk is

03:53.600 --> 03:58.320
extremely overpriced, and by the way, if you don't know what this is, LA, they have, you know,

03:58.320 --> 04:03.840
the Universal Compound right off 101 Freeway. They have this- that's where Universal Studios is,

04:03.840 --> 04:08.560
where Conan O'Brien tapes his show now. It's where they do a lot of special events. It's where the

04:08.560 --> 04:13.600
More Friends concert was a couple years ago. Not Dear Friends, the more- the one More Friends

04:13.600 --> 04:19.760
concert they did at E305 was there at the amphitheater, I think. Yeah, I think it was

04:19.760 --> 04:25.360
05, because 04 was the first Dear Friends, 05 was More Friends, and then, um, they actually have this

04:25.360 --> 04:29.360
big shopping mall there, City Walk. That's where they did the DSi launch, if I'm not mistaken. So

04:29.360 --> 04:34.960
you see these places on TV. Oh, what was the show- what's that show on sci-fi with the, uh, it's like

04:34.960 --> 04:40.000
they call it a video game. It's a show, and it has the bounty hunters chasing you around and all this,

04:40.880 --> 04:43.440
but you have- I know what you're talking about, but I don't remember what it's called. I know

04:43.440 --> 04:47.920
someone in chat's gonna yell it out in any minute. Chat.orangelandrader.com. The one episode of that

04:47.920 --> 04:51.840
show I saw, they actually taped at Universal City Walk, so a lot of people know what this place is,

04:51.840 --> 04:57.520
but it's extremely overpriced. That's, that's all, but I guess, you know, you expect these types of

04:57.520 --> 05:02.960
things are going to be, so yeah. All right, anyhow, enough about, uh, theme park rides and so on. We

05:02.960 --> 05:06.720
have a lot of ground we're going to cover tonight. Here's the interesting thing, and I want to say,

05:06.720 --> 05:11.840
uh, thank you. Chat is now piping up. Chase, Chase, Chase. Everybody's- it's called Chase. All right,

05:11.840 --> 05:18.640
so, um, thank you, chatters. Uh, tonight we have no script, and when I say no script, I don't want you

05:18.640 --> 05:22.240
thinking we plan out everything we're gonna say every week on this show. That's not true. We have

05:22.240 --> 05:27.760
no outline. Yeah, we have no outline. Most shows, like morning shows that you listen to, or, you

05:27.760 --> 05:31.360
know, heck, even the DJs on the radio in the afternoon, they usually have, like, an outline of

05:31.360 --> 05:36.320
topics they're going to talk about. Well, so do we. Not tonight, folks. Uh, there was a moment today

05:36.320 --> 05:42.480
where I thought I might be doing the show by myself, so we didn't end up having an outline at all.

05:42.480 --> 05:47.360
My husband volunteered. Yeah, I know. Dan volunteered. I volunteered him for you. Yeah, but Dan, you know,

05:47.360 --> 05:52.000
does- is not used to having to prepare anything. Dan just comes in here, is funny, and leaves,

05:52.000 --> 05:55.360
you know. That's- that's Dan's role in the show. Sounds like my marriage. We-

05:57.520 --> 06:01.760
I'm sure he'd be very happy to hear that. Can we get him in here to comment on that? No. All right,

06:01.760 --> 06:06.800
so tonight we're just- we have no- I mean, we- I don't know when part A is going to end and part

06:06.800 --> 06:10.960
B is going to begin. We just- we're winging it tonight, but we know we have a lot of ground to

06:10.960 --> 06:16.000
cover with E3 News, so I'm just warning everybody up front. If the show feels a little weird tonight,

06:16.000 --> 06:22.080
it is. So, there you go. All right, let's- well, we know how to start the show. There's only one way

06:22.080 --> 06:27.280
to start the show. So, Dark Sakura, I know sadly you were unable to go to E3. You just got a lot

06:27.280 --> 06:30.560
of other stuff going on in your personal life. You know, we've been listening to the show lately.

06:30.560 --> 06:33.520
You know, you're busy with school. Well, the reason I didn't go to E3 was because of money.

06:33.520 --> 06:38.560
Which, you know, would be a personal life thing, but- I will admit it. Our economy sucks.

06:38.560 --> 06:42.480
It's- it's tough. You know what? E3 was smaller than it was in, oh,

06:42.480 --> 06:46.960
six, when they did the last big one, but I- this is how I've been describing E3 to people.

06:46.960 --> 06:54.240
It was E3 2006 with less Paris Hilton, and that's a great thing. The world with less Paris Hilton

06:54.240 --> 06:58.960
would be a great thing. And- and honestly, the show- the show itself was still- it still felt

06:58.960 --> 07:03.840
big. It still had that feel of E3 2006, but there were a lot less booth babes. That was one thing I

07:03.840 --> 07:09.600
noticed off the top. I mean, a few- Was that a good thing? Well, not necessarily, but my point

07:09.600 --> 07:14.080
I was going to make with that is that I think- I think, honestly, the booth babes may in part be a

07:14.080 --> 07:19.920
victim of the economy. Booth babes are not cheap. It costs a lot for all that silicone. It does.

07:19.920 --> 07:25.280
And I think, in a way, I think a lot of booths cut back on their babes because this year there

07:25.280 --> 07:29.440
was definitely a strictly business feeling about it. You know, people were there to get their shit

07:29.440 --> 07:35.360
done, and- I think that that's better, but you have to have a little flash. And some companies

07:35.360 --> 07:38.400
like Nyko is the one that comes to mind. The ones that have the big inflatable,

07:38.400 --> 07:41.520
the big inflatable Wii controllers. They did have some booth babes.

07:41.520 --> 07:44.400
Nintendo had their- I want a big inflatable Wii controller.

07:44.400 --> 07:50.880
Nintendo didn't have booth babes, but they had the educated, good-looking women that were showing

07:50.880 --> 07:55.280
off. They just were well, you know, they weren't dressed, you know, cheaply. And a couple- I mean,

07:55.280 --> 07:58.640
I'm not saying there weren't any booth babes anywhere. There were the trauma center babes.

07:58.640 --> 08:02.400
I think one of the- I think one of the Capcom games or something had some booth babes. There

08:02.400 --> 08:07.840
just were way less than I saw at E3 2006, and I in part blame the economy. I think-

08:07.840 --> 08:11.040
I don't see that as a bad thing. I think the economy cut back on a lot of those

08:11.040 --> 08:13.760
types of things this year, so- Less silicone, more games.

08:13.760 --> 08:18.080
And zero booth studs that I saw. Well, now that's a travesty.

08:18.080 --> 08:22.640
That is a huge travesty. But anyway- Equal, you know-

08:22.640 --> 08:24.560
Equal opportunity, absolutely. Equal representation.

08:24.560 --> 08:28.720
There's more and more women going to E3, working and doing, you know, things. Women play games.

08:28.720 --> 08:34.640
Sometimes we want booth babes too. Surprise. All right. And you know, I happen to be one of those

08:34.640 --> 08:38.480
guys, so I wouldn't mind seeing some of those booth studs. But I've learned to just accept

08:38.480 --> 08:42.400
that's not going to happen. So whatever. Well, it is fun harassing the booth babes though.

08:42.400 --> 08:47.280
All right. Anyhow, let's get into your gaming week. Besides E3, how was your gaming week?

08:47.840 --> 08:51.120
I did what I'm doing right now. Which is?

08:51.120 --> 08:53.840
Playing Sims. Now not just old school Sims.

08:53.840 --> 08:56.240
Sims 3. So you at least played a new game.

08:56.240 --> 09:05.040
Oh yes. And we've actually had full reviews posted on it on the blog I contribute to that

09:05.040 --> 09:13.680
Tara keeps at AvengersTower.com. She reviewed the game itself. I reviewed the exchange in the store

09:13.680 --> 09:18.720
and the house mechanics. You know me, I love building the houses. I'm building the Avengers

09:18.720 --> 09:20.960
mansion right now. Well, so give us a little synopsis.

09:20.960 --> 09:24.640
What makes this game special compared to previous installments in the franchise?

09:24.640 --> 09:28.720
It's new and really that's not very special right now. I mean a lot of the play in it is

09:29.600 --> 09:36.720
improved. You can put diagonal furniture and change a few things. The build a house mode

09:36.720 --> 09:41.280
is a lot better. You can definitely customize your body shapes a bit more. But see there's

09:41.280 --> 09:45.840
a problem is that the faces are butt ugly and it takes a lot of adjustment to get them not butt

09:45.840 --> 09:56.880
ugly and they have no chins. What are all the other complaints back and forth? Oh yeah bad

09:56.880 --> 10:03.440
hair. Pretty much what I want is I want them to have a way to import all the Sims 2 customization

10:03.440 --> 10:08.640
into Sims 3. Although they are working on it they have already figured out how to unlock some stuff

10:08.640 --> 10:13.040
and we've got a few new skins in there and hopefully we'll get better hair because the

10:13.040 --> 10:19.040
hair in the game sucks and you can actually buy points to use in their store. They've got some

10:19.040 --> 10:24.320
neat stuff in the store but the only thing that I was actually super excited about was like a lamp

10:25.200 --> 10:30.320
and a bathtub because it was a really cool bathtub. Sounds like a trip to IKEA. I want

10:30.320 --> 10:37.600
an IKEA pack. Sims 2 had IKEA packs. I want an IKEA pack. For real? Yeah. There's a huge Sims

10:37.600 --> 10:42.160
culture. I think a lot of times you know because our show we try to touch on PC gaming and I think

10:42.160 --> 10:46.880
we do to an extent but I think you know I'll admit it we stay pretty focused on consoles and I think

10:46.880 --> 10:53.200
sometimes even the PC gamers we neglect how huge the Sims franchise is. This isn't the Sims like

10:53.200 --> 10:58.800
the best-selling PC game ever? I wouldn't say. I'm pretty sure it is. So there there's this huge

10:58.800 --> 11:02.320
culture around it. I would have never guessed however that there was actually IKEA packs for

11:02.320 --> 11:07.280
Sims 2. That's hilarious. Yeah I mean the whole the whole part the whole thing about the Sims is

11:07.280 --> 11:13.440
that you know especially through cheating like me um you can have all kinds of neat stuff happen you

11:13.440 --> 11:19.520
you know for people like they had um on Sims 2 people would do like whole Star Trek packages

11:19.520 --> 11:25.920
and even recreated the ships. It's really also a big just general fandom outlet too. It's really

11:25.920 --> 11:32.160
got so much to do um and if anyone is interested- Is there a furries pack for furry fandom?

11:32.160 --> 11:39.040
Not yet but uh people have tried um but if you want to look on the exchange I've put up all of

11:39.040 --> 11:43.360
not all of everything but a lot of the stuff that I've made so far just look up I'm on there is Dark

11:43.360 --> 11:49.840
Sakura. You can see like a house I built which I forgot to put a certain door to the balcony so no

11:49.840 --> 11:55.200
one can go on the balcony. Now speaking of exchange I don't think Sims 2 had this. This

11:55.200 --> 11:59.920
sounds more like what Spore had where you can publish all your creations to the web right?

11:59.920 --> 12:06.320
You could do it with Sims 2 they had um you know where you could post up your stuff but you had to

12:06.320 --> 12:10.080
of course register your game and really they didn't have anything on there that you couldn't get

12:10.080 --> 12:17.280
anywhere else you know once the um big mod forums came out um which I actually I'll go ahead and

12:17.280 --> 12:22.320
plug my favorite right now modthesims.com um they're probably the best one out there.

12:23.120 --> 12:25.840
So overall with Sims 3 all you were hoping for and more?

12:25.840 --> 12:32.720
I really had very little in the way of expectation so um I like it I'm not displeased with it I like

12:32.720 --> 12:38.800
that you can if like like if the floor or something is like butt ugly you can just change it and you

12:38.800 --> 12:45.360
can like I will you can actually go in and any of the the floors that you lay down you can actually

12:45.360 --> 12:51.680
go back in and change the color of them like um this little uh tool that I have here is a palette

12:51.680 --> 12:58.960
tool and you can go in if it will let me and actually change the various colors in it by

12:59.680 --> 13:05.760
sliding the little slider and it'll change all the colors and then you can just copy that one

13:05.760 --> 13:09.680
and paste it all over the place it's really neat I've done a few custom floors myself.

13:09.680 --> 13:14.080
I'm reading some chat comments chat dot orange laundry dot com decipher is in chat and wants

13:14.080 --> 13:18.640
to clarify Sims 2 had it it just wasn't as intuitive I believe talking about the whole

13:18.640 --> 13:26.240
web interface this is this is actually super easy like um oh come on you butt head she's getting

13:26.240 --> 13:32.160
error messages I talk to I talk to my games all the time that's right um for example I'm just

13:32.160 --> 13:40.480
gonna show you with um a piece of furniture like say that I put this um stupidly ugly bed

13:41.520 --> 13:48.160
right here and I hate that the stupidly ugly bed is stupidly ugly so I want to change it so I hit

13:48.160 --> 13:54.640
my little um palette thing oh my god it is an ugly bed um and then I can go through and say

13:54.640 --> 14:00.880
you know what I really hate this rose pattern thing I want this leaf pattern instead so I

14:00.880 --> 14:06.640
can pick the leaf pattern as soon as all this other crap loads and my computer's a little

14:06.640 --> 14:12.080
taxed of course because I have everything running for the show um but it will change the bedspread

14:12.080 --> 14:20.160
too it seems to me that you play sims really for the design element you really like to design the

14:20.160 --> 14:25.200
houses you like to design the furniture and color every little piece is there stuff there because I

14:25.200 --> 14:29.440
suck at designing is there something in this game for me is there actual game to play well you can

14:29.440 --> 14:34.880
just pick a house you can download houses that other people have done after you've murdered the

14:34.880 --> 14:41.680
family no you can you have empty lots and you can evict people and right now it's still thinking

14:41.680 --> 14:45.920
about changing that bedspread to green but what would happen is I would save it here and then I

14:45.920 --> 14:52.560
would pick share and then when I go in you have this other thing that's called the um the launcher

14:53.440 --> 14:56.480
which is the first thing that loads up when you does that launch sims

14:58.000 --> 15:06.240
out of a cannon sorry it's mod the sims info by the way um the site um but then you go into this

15:06.960 --> 15:10.320
and you can actually those are screenshots up there but you can select

15:10.320 --> 15:14.960
that one of the items that you've saved specifically for sharing and click upload

15:14.960 --> 15:20.320
and almost instantly it's on the exchange for you and everybody else in the universe to see

15:20.320 --> 15:24.240
all the crap that you've managed to make and again kind of like spores creature creator kind

15:24.240 --> 15:27.520
of reminds me of that and of course everything that you've picked for download and this also

15:27.520 --> 15:33.280
works now for the content that that's up on uh mod the sims right now is that you just click on

15:33.280 --> 15:38.400
the little pack and it loads it into this and you can choose to install it in your game it's pretty

15:38.400 --> 15:42.080
it's pretty neat i think it's pretty neat all right well maybe i'll have to check that out a

15:42.080 --> 15:46.960
little later so it's it's worth it i think it's worthwhile well let's move on and talk about more

15:46.960 --> 15:53.280
gaming weeks uh loki but oh finally it changed to that green pattern it's camo uh loki besides the

15:53.280 --> 15:56.160
stuff you played at e3 because we'll have plenty of time for that in a little bit how was your

15:56.160 --> 16:03.680
gaming week i played fuel more fuel at least in um it was fun you know still driving around trying

16:03.680 --> 16:11.520
to get um more stuff unlocked really just trying to drive around get collect more uh fuel containers

16:11.520 --> 16:18.960
to unlock more cars but man that game is big i like i'm gonna spend one of these days actually

16:18.960 --> 16:24.480
just trying to drive across the whole map but it probably will take a whole day because it's that

16:24.480 --> 16:30.080
big it seems um yeah i'm looking at some of the reviews of that game because i'm considering

16:30.080 --> 16:34.400
picking it up it seems like it's getting very average reviews that people don't think i guess

16:34.400 --> 16:38.080
the implementation is good or something i don't know what people's problems is with it but it's

16:38.080 --> 16:47.520
all right i don't know it's nothing really like it you know and um well the next racing game similar

16:47.520 --> 16:53.920
to it's going to be dirt too and that's not out until september so actually there's no rule

16:53.920 --> 17:01.040
racing games i think coming out until september other than fuel which has already come out so

17:02.560 --> 17:08.800
yeah i don't know anything else besides the e3 stuff uh more grand theft auto 4 that's about it

17:08.800 --> 17:13.840
of course um my gaming week obviously with e3 kind of uh you know being this week there wasn't

17:13.840 --> 17:18.720
a whole lot i played outside of e3 but i will tell you once i got home one of the first things

17:18.720 --> 17:21.760
i wanted to do well i did play a little bit of fall past 11 because i mentioned in a previous

17:21.760 --> 17:25.840
show i'd gone back to it i haven't played a whole lot but i did finally have my first experience

17:25.840 --> 17:29.760
party and uh yeah the level sync's pretty cool you don't have to worry about everybody being

17:29.760 --> 17:34.000
you know a certain level range anymore you just kind of do your thing uh so it makes it a lot

17:34.000 --> 17:38.480
easier just kind of hit the ground and get started i do notice though you do still sometimes have to

17:38.480 --> 17:42.160
wait a while for people to show up and stuff i have yet to see i hear there's more stuff you can

17:42.160 --> 17:48.080
do duo and trio i've yet to really see that but um hopefully hopefully i'll see that a little more

17:48.080 --> 17:52.640
you know to be fair i haven't played a whole lot of hours in this game uh because e3 got in the

17:52.640 --> 17:56.560
way and right as soon as i got home from e3 one thing i wanted to do i was like you know i kind

17:56.560 --> 18:00.880
of want to go play final fantasy 7 because that just came out you know on the whole playstation

18:00.880 --> 18:05.440
3 i haven't played that game in years my discs are so scratched up they don't work anymore so

18:05.440 --> 18:08.720
i think i want to go play final fantasy 7 and then as i was downloading it after paying the

18:08.720 --> 18:14.560
10 to download it i realized oh crap final fantasy 4 the after years came out this week

18:14.560 --> 18:19.920
i have got to go play that because final fantasy 4 is like my favorite final fantasy ever at least

18:19.920 --> 18:26.160
the one i have the most like nostalgia with you know because that was my first real in-depth

18:26.160 --> 18:29.360
final fantasy game that i just got totally immersed with i mean i remember playing the

18:29.360 --> 18:33.840
very first one on the nes when i was like nine or ten years old i don't remember how old i was

18:33.840 --> 18:39.600
but i remember playing that very first one on the nes and it was cool but um i didn't really get

18:39.600 --> 18:46.240
immersed until final fantasy 2 here in the us which as we all know is really 4 so finally i i

18:46.240 --> 18:51.040
i'm very excited to hear the sequel came out and it's on cell phones so i checked out final

18:51.040 --> 18:58.400
fantasy 4 the after years on the wii and uh yeah my nostalgia strings were successfully tugged

18:58.400 --> 19:06.160
i was kind of surprised at how much of just kind of a reskinning of final fantasy 4 a lot of it

19:06.160 --> 19:12.000
was i mean i'm not even joking like the same overworld map a lot of the same like city maps

19:12.000 --> 19:17.600
i mean some of the dungeon maps are new but pretty much the same city maps same music um now granted

19:17.600 --> 19:21.440
they gave it those little minor upgrades that you know it kind of gets when it's when they're coming

19:21.440 --> 19:24.720
over to the wii but basically i felt like i was playing something on virtual console but of course

19:24.720 --> 19:29.680
i had to remind myself okay rob you are playing a port of a cell phone game so i mean i guess if

19:29.680 --> 19:32.800
i could compare it to anything it would be very similar to playing like final fantasy 4 on game

19:32.800 --> 19:36.800
boy advance or wonder swan color like you know that kind of like slightly souped up

19:36.800 --> 19:42.880
upgrade from the original super nintendo one um but here's the interesting thing about it

19:42.880 --> 19:48.880
is that it's it's episodic so what you're paying i think it was what 800 wii points i think to

19:48.880 --> 19:53.520
download the game what you're buying is really only about five or six hours worth of game oh

19:53.520 --> 19:59.920
wonderful if you go if you want to get these seven other episodes with the spin-off characters

19:59.920 --> 20:04.960
they're like 300 wii points each and then the final chapter is supposed to be another 800 points

20:04.960 --> 20:09.760
but i guess they're rolling this out slowly like there's a side story on ridia out now i haven't

20:09.760 --> 20:14.400
really played it yet i i plan to though um and then once you complete all these side stories

20:14.400 --> 20:19.040
you can use the characters from the side stories in the closing chapter is what i hear is supposed

20:19.040 --> 20:25.040
to happen so i mean that's kind of cool here's here's the thing it plays and feels like final

20:25.040 --> 20:30.240
fantasy 4 on the super nintendo not on the ds no voice acting nothing i mean it plays and feels

20:30.240 --> 20:35.760
so if you want an old school super nintendo rpg if that's what you've been clamoring for if that's

20:35.760 --> 20:41.920
what you miss much like you appealed to mega man or mega man 9 appealed to you because you missed

20:41.920 --> 20:47.200
the old school nes mega man games then you will like final fantasy 4 the after years but if this

20:47.200 --> 20:52.720
isn't the type of game you grew up on and stuff and maybe this isn't you know 2d rpgs aren't your

20:52.720 --> 20:57.200
thing you might kind of find this game to be a little bit of a rip and i will tell you for only

20:57.200 --> 21:02.160
six hours worth of gameplay it's it's a bit of a challenge for me to wholeheartedly endorse this

21:02.160 --> 21:07.120
but i go you know what it's a fairly well written story at least what i've gotten into so far

21:07.840 --> 21:13.040
just just playing it all over again is is kind of making me giddy i actually kind of

21:13.040 --> 21:15.920
am having a lot of fun with it and that's what really games are all about so if you

21:15.920 --> 21:20.800
want the nostalgia final fantasy 4 all over again definitely go check this out but you know what

21:20.800 --> 21:27.200
this made me think about as i was playing it here's the thing what what what really made me

21:27.200 --> 21:31.200
think about uh this was this whole story that we've been covering on the show the last couple

21:31.200 --> 21:35.440
weeks you know how square shut down that chrono trigger fan project remember how somebody was

21:35.440 --> 21:39.920
making this chrono trigger rom for the super nintendo that was like it was like using the

21:39.920 --> 21:43.520
old chrono trigger data but it was like a news story and all this stuff remember this and square

21:43.520 --> 21:47.120
sent them a cease and desist letter and we were like you bastards why did you shut down this

21:47.120 --> 21:50.920
project it was just a fan thing I realized this week they shut it down

21:50.920 --> 21:54.760
because that's what they did with Final Fantasy for the after years that's what

21:54.760 --> 22:02.440
it is it's a reskin Final Fantasy 4 with new dialogue new stuff it didn't hit me

22:02.440 --> 22:08.920
until now square before us huh yes in a way I mean even though this game's

22:08.920 --> 22:12.520
already been out in Japan on cell phones for a while I think that's why they shut

22:12.520 --> 22:16.440
the chrono trigger project down if this Final Fantasy 4 thing is successful I

22:16.440 --> 22:22.160
betcha they're gonna do one for chrono trigger it's probably cheap to do so

22:22.160 --> 22:26.040
there's yeah that's why it got shut down it is cheap to do it's all is is

22:26.040 --> 22:31.040
programming you know scenarios and you know no real sprite creating since you've

22:31.040 --> 22:35.600
already you're using the same sprites just creating a few world maps already

22:35.600 --> 22:39.360
spread to be fair and Henderson Henderson man says this in chat there are

22:39.360 --> 22:43.600
new characters and yes there are some new characters the guards wedge and I

22:43.600 --> 22:47.200
always thought it was Vicks but it's now bigs in this game maybe that has

22:47.200 --> 22:51.200
somebody to do the translation play bigger roles in this game see a door is

22:51.200 --> 22:55.080
a new character so to be fair there are some new sprites of new characters and

22:55.080 --> 22:59.160
things but a lot of recycled monsters I don't think I've run into a single new

22:59.160 --> 23:02.920
monster yet I mean they're all monsters from the old game I mean and some new

23:02.920 --> 23:08.640
maps like Devil's Road which is the road that connects massidia and Baron you

23:08.640 --> 23:13.000
used to just go in there and it will be and you appear in Baron well now they've

23:13.000 --> 23:16.200
actually made like I don't I don't think this is very spoilery and I apologize if

23:16.200 --> 23:19.920
you feel it is but they've made a little dungeon to go with the connection now

23:19.920 --> 23:24.600
that you have to work your way through so to say they have just only reskinned

23:24.600 --> 23:29.720
it that's that wouldn't be a fair thing to say they have done minor tweaks but

23:29.720 --> 23:32.880
I'm telling you you're gonna play this game and you're gonna be like I feel

23:32.880 --> 23:37.360
like I'm playing Final Fantasy 4 plus I feel like I've popped in my Final

23:37.360 --> 23:42.000
Fantasy 2 with two cartridge from the Super Nintendo and unlocked a whole like

23:42.000 --> 23:46.360
secret level that wasn't there that's what it feels like and that's why this

23:46.360 --> 23:49.400
chrono trigger fan project got shut down because maybe this is the direction

23:49.400 --> 23:56.000
square setting it let's see the Rob D and chat says the translator Final

23:56.000 --> 24:00.000
Fantasy 6 apparently wasn't a Star Wars fan well all the Super Nintendo Final

24:00.000 --> 24:03.160
Fantasy yeah I remember it was it was something to do with Star Wars always

24:03.160 --> 24:06.000
bigs and wedge that's right okay so thank you Rob D that's right Vicks was a

24:06.000 --> 24:10.440
mr. mistranslation in the American Final Fantasy 2 and 3 they did Vicks what

24:10.440 --> 24:14.800
instead of wedge but but or and instead of bigs so it makes sense I figured it

24:14.800 --> 24:19.600
was something like that as well but not in seven mm-hmm remember were they in

24:19.600 --> 24:25.880
that game they weren't they might have been like yeah they usually show up as

24:25.880 --> 24:30.920
guards somewhere black wolf our good buddy who celebrated his 200th episode

24:30.920 --> 24:34.720
right before we went live tonight says and chat hell telltale does the same

24:34.720 --> 24:39.520
thing and we love them and 300 points isn't that bad it's really not 300

24:39.520 --> 24:43.640
points for a couple hours worth of gameplay I think is worth it but you

24:43.640 --> 24:47.280
know I just understand you're gonna be spending your money on something old

24:47.280 --> 24:51.520
school if you're spoiled by all these newfangled 3d graphics and things I

24:51.520 --> 24:55.640
don't know if there's a lot here for you but if you love Final Fantasy 4 as much

24:55.640 --> 24:59.520
as I do you're gonna love this I think I think it's definitely worth the price

24:59.520 --> 25:03.240
and and quite honestly I think all the add-ons will probably be worth it too

25:03.240 --> 25:07.280
hell I saw a great argument the other day on a forum or something Final

25:07.280 --> 25:12.560
Fantasy 2 as a cartridge when it came out was like $70 okay it was like $70

25:12.560 --> 25:17.560
and this was back in what 91 so that's probably like $100 by today's standards

25:17.560 --> 25:24.040
so you know the nickel and diming doesn't feel quite so bad here so there

25:24.040 --> 25:26.920
you go and Henderson man and Chad apparently is a fan of the game and says

25:26.920 --> 25:30.880
and that's what I wanted from the after years by the way Rydia story is about

25:30.880 --> 25:34.840
three is three dollars for about four hours so yeah I mean don't get me wrong

25:34.840 --> 25:37.920
I'm not slamming the game for what they doin it's just you know know what you're

25:37.920 --> 25:41.400
getting into I was caught a little off guard I was expecting it to be kind of

25:41.400 --> 25:45.120
like newer and fancier but now that I'm kind of playing it I'm like you know

25:45.120 --> 25:49.120
there's a part of me that's kind of glad it's not it is kind of neat to revisit

25:49.120 --> 25:56.120
that game I loved literally loved you know 15 years ago 15 18 years ago so I

25:56.120 --> 26:01.560
do endorse Final Fantasy for the after years if you are a fan of Final Fantasy

26:01.560 --> 26:08.600
for it all um Rob D in chat says yes but times are different now why should we

26:08.600 --> 26:12.120
judge it by antiquated pricing not to say it's not worth it I just don't think

26:12.120 --> 26:17.000
that's a good argument fair enough I see your point but you know there's a lot of

26:17.000 --> 26:20.760
crap out there they are trying to charge this five and ten dollars and do some of

26:20.760 --> 26:24.800
this episodic money for I think you know again if you know what you're getting

26:24.800 --> 26:29.200
into if you know you want that Final Fantasy for old-school nostalgia you

26:29.200 --> 26:33.720
know not a lot of people complain about Mega Man 9 I think it's gonna be worth

26:33.720 --> 26:39.000
it so all right and separate 1215 says that's nothing I think Phantasy Star 4

26:39.000 --> 26:42.440
was like $100 that's true that was a really expensive Genesis game it was

26:42.440 --> 26:47.160
this crazy Street Fighter 2 and Mortal Kombat when they first came out for the

26:47.160 --> 26:50.240
Super Nintendo were also extremely expensive if I remember I remember

26:50.240 --> 26:54.400
paying $65 for killer instinct that actually isn't even the most I've ever

26:54.400 --> 26:58.200
spent for a Nintendo cartridge super Nintendo cartridge I did import the

26:58.200 --> 27:03.320
Sailor Moon super s fighting game for a hundred and ten bucks cool my early days

27:03.320 --> 27:07.240
of importing yeah did you get import game is a whole nother story so there

27:07.240 --> 27:12.000
you go so Henderson man kind of concludes this is the last thing I want

27:12.000 --> 27:15.080
to say on the Final Fantasy 4 after years well think of it like this the

27:15.080 --> 27:19.520
total price for Final Fantasy 4 the after years is $37 for the full game

27:19.520 --> 27:23.880
about the same price as a DS game remake and that's true and you know what and in

27:23.880 --> 27:27.400
the end when you add up all these hours that would be what like 21 and it

27:27.400 --> 27:30.560
probably about 30 hours of gameplay which is about what you get out of a DS

27:30.560 --> 27:35.400
cartridge anyway so you know but just again not going to be your cutting-edge

27:35.400 --> 27:40.200
graphics think Mega Man 9 but Final Fantasy that's all I'm saying I'd pay

27:40.200 --> 27:46.400
for it seriously I I I I my nostalgia strings are extremely tickled by this

27:46.400 --> 27:52.400
game extremely and I hear the story gets really good I'm really avoiding spoilers

27:52.400 --> 27:56.920
I am I'm probably only about an hour and a half two hours into the main episode

27:56.920 --> 28:03.160
I know I have plenty more to go but I'm I'm I'm squealing so far are you

28:03.160 --> 28:10.000
squealing in a girly manner a little bit of both all right anyhow let's uh let's

28:10.000 --> 28:14.000
move on and get into some housekeeping tonight housekeeping we are slowly

28:14.000 --> 28:18.040

29:28.720 --> 29:33.640
looking incredibly bored playing the new DDR game because it's incredibly boring

29:33.640 --> 29:39.040
all right well let's get to it let's talk e3 let's talk about e3 and and how

29:39.040 --> 29:42.320
it all went down we have no script tonight so let's just kind of I guess

29:42.320 --> 29:45.800
since you brought up DDR let's start with the music games it's where our fan

29:45.800 --> 29:49.520
you know the the fans have been listening to us for seven years know us from way

29:49.520 --> 29:52.800
back then let's talk about music games because there's been some very good

29:52.800 --> 29:57.920
music games at e3 some very bad music games at e3 and some very non-existent

29:57.920 --> 30:01.880
music games at e3 that's where I want to start where the hell was DJ hero isn't

30:01.880 --> 30:05.120
this game supposed to be out in a couple months it was shown behind closed doors

30:05.120 --> 30:10.960
well how nice did they let people play it they had it demoed on a live stage

30:10.960 --> 30:14.320
they had demoed in front of a crowd and that was pretty cool but they didn't get

30:14.320 --> 30:19.480
they didn't let people play it and I'm what are they trying to hide I don't

30:19.480 --> 30:23.320
know is the game not done yet are there songs that are there trying to be you

30:23.320 --> 30:26.880
know I did they not want people breaking the peripheral out on the show floor I

30:26.880 --> 30:33.480
I could be wrong chatters please correct me if I'm wrong is DJ hero isn't DJ

30:33.480 --> 30:37.900
hero getting released this summer it's getting released this fall okay so there

30:37.900 --> 30:41.080
are still a few months out so maybe they are still making some fine in October

30:41.080 --> 30:45.760
okay October I thought it was out in June October 20th scratch was supposed

30:45.760 --> 30:49.980
to be out in June that's why I thought that yet scratch scratch I did not see

30:49.980 --> 30:53.880
in the show floor at all I got up to leave trouble I heard it was there

30:53.880 --> 30:58.680
though but I didn't get to see it I've already kind of seen it so you know

30:58.680 --> 31:04.720
whatever um let's see so so there's not a lot to say on DJ hero huge booth to

31:04.720 --> 31:10.240
put on music and play these you know DJ here oh and do this now stuff granted DJ

31:10.240 --> 31:14.200
hero wasn't you know available to play which is too bad because there have been

31:14.200 --> 31:18.580
lines everywhere for that stuff but neither was rest of like activisions

31:18.580 --> 31:23.640
kind of music tiles no guitar hero 5 no guitar hit well guitar o van Halen was

31:23.640 --> 31:28.960
around guitar hero van Halen was at Sony's booth yes yes but not activisions

31:28.960 --> 31:34.920
no guitar hero PSP which was a kind of a you know slipped under the radar there

31:34.920 --> 31:39.920
no band hero but they had a trailer for that although I didn't see it I just

31:39.920 --> 31:47.360
know that they did but they had it on stage they were demoing on stage and DJ

31:47.360 --> 31:53.240
hero looks sweet yeah I mean don't be wrong DJ hero looks great but it looks

31:53.240 --> 31:57.800
fun to play it I want to play it I do want to get my hands on it and see for

31:57.800 --> 32:01.200
myself I understand I guess that's what I'm trying to do maybe that's what

32:01.200 --> 32:04.280
they're trying to do is leave it a mystery for all of us but I don't I just

32:04.280 --> 32:07.360
I don't know I still get frustrated at e3 when I see these like millions of

32:07.360 --> 32:12.080
dollars spent to like you know do this big DJ hero show for what I don't know

32:12.080 --> 32:16.000
behind closed doors for speciality white 100% behind it yeah because you know

32:16.000 --> 32:20.360
before they were only showing half the controller like what the hell and you

32:20.360 --> 32:23.200
know before that you're probably you know people were there expecting people

32:23.200 --> 32:26.440
to go oh my goodness you know what is this you know this looks so cool you

32:26.440 --> 32:29.840
know I'll learn more about it but people were just kind of going how are you

32:29.840 --> 32:33.160
gonna play this this this looks dumb what are they doing you know and then

32:33.160 --> 32:37.600
they finally you know just during e3 they finally released the rest of the

32:37.600 --> 32:41.800
pictures of you know what the actual controller was you know beside the fact

32:41.800 --> 32:46.500
it was in game informer but you know actually having it free to look at

32:46.500 --> 32:53.560
outside of game in former you know they just put up the stuff for it but yeah I

32:53.560 --> 32:57.760
mean it looks cool and I like watching it being performed and they did it they

32:57.760 --> 33:01.600
did both just you know an actual song that they did the one that they had the

33:01.600 --> 33:07.600
Beastie Boys mash-up thing where the guy was playing the guitar. Both of them look pretty cool, but um...

33:08.400 --> 33:12.480
I don't know. I mean, besides, you know, being able to play it, I mean, it looks cool.

33:13.960 --> 33:19.400
Um, all right, so we had Guitar Hero, and yeah, Van Halen, I guess, was confirmed or whatever.

33:19.400 --> 33:21.400
Yeah, it was already coming out. We already knew it.

33:23.600 --> 33:30.320
Scratch was nowhere to be seen. All right, Konami's booth, they had the new DDR and games on the Wii and the

33:30.320 --> 33:35.660
PlayStation 2. Did you hear what they're doing with DDR? No, what? Oh, you're gonna love this.

33:36.440 --> 33:42.120
Can I mini rant? Why don't I do my mini rant, and then you can piss me off even more what you're about to say.

33:42.240 --> 33:43.440
Okay?

33:43.440 --> 33:48.660
Keep in mind, folks, this show would not exist if it weren't for DDR.

33:48.660 --> 33:56.000
I love what DDR has done for my life and the people it's introduced me to and all of this stuff. That being said,

33:56.000 --> 34:01.240
I went to go play DDR at Konami's booth on the PlayStation 2 and on the Wii.

34:01.240 --> 34:06.000
I cannot tell these fucking games apart anymore. Like, I don't even know what it's called.

34:06.000 --> 34:10.880
I didn't even bother to look up the name because it's the same fucking thing as last year with just different songs.

34:11.040 --> 34:15.620
That is what DDR has turned into. It's everybody's worst fear that we all kind of, you know, and

34:16.200 --> 34:21.260
a couple years ago when some of these games were new, people were kind of heckling and saying,

34:21.260 --> 34:27.380
this is just gonna turn into like a sports game where it's just, you know, it's the roster update 2009.

34:27.380 --> 34:29.380
It's just new songs.

34:29.420 --> 34:31.420
I apologize. You were right.

34:31.500 --> 34:39.300
You were right. That's what the franchise has turned into. It's roster update 2009 with new songs. I see nothing here to report on.

34:40.660 --> 34:42.660
Rihanna's in it. Whoopee!

34:43.580 --> 34:48.140
On the Wii one, you can now play on the balance board and shake your hips. Yay!

34:48.140 --> 34:52.900
That is new. That is something legitimately new. It is new and it is stupid.

34:52.900 --> 34:59.740
I agree. I agree with the stupid part, but hey, it is new. Then, not only that, not, okay,

34:59.740 --> 35:06.340
so it would piss off fans enough that they didn't really do anything with the song list, that song list sucks, and that, you know,

35:06.340 --> 35:09.740
the songs that they've just brought back a bunch of older songs and stuff like that.

35:10.300 --> 35:14.460
That would be fine as it is. Oh, but they didn't leave it there.

35:14.460 --> 35:20.620
No, let's piss people off by taking Dynamite Rave and changing the lyrics to it, making it even worse.

35:20.620 --> 35:22.780
I hate to tell you, but they already did that. Download the DDR for the iPhone.

35:22.780 --> 35:26.620
You can download Brilliant 2U with lyrics, and it'll make your inner Bamani fanboy cry.

35:27.740 --> 35:33.620
Well, it's still sad. I'm just, I'm just, I'm done. That's how long it's been since I played it. I've given up on Konami.

35:33.620 --> 35:39.420
I've given up on these games. I officially give up. But Rob, how can they possibly innovate this game?

35:39.420 --> 35:41.860
Can I, can I read, can I read these comments from chat real fast?

35:41.860 --> 35:48.860
Comments from chat, act deft. Eight arrows for the 360 and PS3. Alpha-Cananagram, did you try PS3 360 version with eight arrow pad?

35:48.860 --> 35:50.380
No, it was not on the floor.

35:50.380 --> 35:54.980
Nope, and they did have that, and Technomotion did it first.

35:54.980 --> 36:03.100
You know what, though? I don't care. Technomotion was shit. If you ever actually played Technomotion, it was fucking garbage.

36:03.100 --> 36:08.580
Okay? It's the one game everybody talked about back in the day, like, hey, I played Technomotion, because nobody had it.

36:08.580 --> 36:16.260
Why? Because it was fucking garbage. So, okay, fine, if this is how DDR is gonna innovate with the eight arrow pad, whatever, let's see the goods.

36:16.260 --> 36:20.460
Maybe I'll change my mind. I'm not convinced adding four more arrows is gonna make it any more fun.

36:20.460 --> 36:21.900
It's not gonna make it any more fun.

36:21.900 --> 36:24.820
Oh, is that what you were gonna tell me is gonna piss me off even more?

36:24.820 --> 36:33.340
Yes. Because it's not gonna make it more fun, because they don't understand. They don't understand what, seriously, they need someone to kick their ass.

36:33.340 --> 36:40.700
It's because they don't really get it. They're trying to focus this game on, you know, the casual audience, the people that picked this up.

36:40.700 --> 36:49.220
But the problem is, you know, you had an install base already, and all you're doing is like, okay, screw this install base, because they're gonna buy whatever we put out,

36:49.220 --> 36:54.180
because, you know, everybody keeps telling them, oh, buy Konami products, and then they'll, you know, put out more.

36:54.180 --> 37:00.180
But people aren't doing that anymore, and so now you're going after these new people instead of trying to recapture the fans.

37:00.180 --> 37:04.900
You already had your base right there. If you kept them happy, you would be selling enough each year.

37:04.900 --> 37:09.700
News slash, Konami does not care about the DDR fan base, because we all got old.

37:09.700 --> 37:14.660
It's been 10 years, and we're all too old to dance now, so they are going after children.

37:14.660 --> 37:21.060
I mean, that's what it is. I hate to break it to you folks. Konami does not care. You're all 30 now.

37:21.060 --> 37:29.220
Konami does not care about you anymore. You're all gonna have kids, and they want your kids playing DDR. That's where it's at.

37:29.220 --> 37:37.220
The thing they need to remember is that we, for all of us who grew up gamers, we're not gonna buy shit for our kids.

37:37.220 --> 37:41.540
We're not gonna buy them crappy games. We're gonna buy them stuff that we'll want to play too.

37:41.540 --> 37:45.220
But the thing, I mean, I was even thinking about this on the ride over here today.

37:45.220 --> 37:50.100
Like, the problem with Konami is they don't get what makes their games sell.

37:50.100 --> 37:56.020
It's basically, you know, with DDR, it was all about the music and kind of the surprises.

37:56.020 --> 38:01.380
Like, with each different mix, they were adding something that was kind of new that was surprising.

38:01.380 --> 38:03.620
Like, the freeze arrows and stuff, that was kind of surprising for us.

38:03.620 --> 38:07.540
There was a new element in there that got people interested, but it wasn't just the gimmicks.

38:07.540 --> 38:13.300
It was also the soundtrack, because the soundtrack had core elements that, you know, the fans could rely on.

38:13.300 --> 38:20.180
You know, there was gonna be a dance meeting attraction. You know, there was gonna be some good, you know, in-house music that they would have done.

38:20.180 --> 38:28.180
You know, new challenge songs and stuff like that, and new elements thrown in there. But now, they don't really want to do any of that.

38:28.180 --> 38:34.420
So what they're gonna do is, and I'm not even, you know, I'm with you. I don't even know what the hell they're calling this game, because it just said Dance Dance Revolution.

38:34.420 --> 38:35.460
I don't care!

38:35.460 --> 38:37.300
Nor do I, yeah. I don't care either, but-

38:37.300 --> 38:40.900
I don't want to tell you what it's called. Honestly.

38:40.900 --> 38:47.300
As a journalist, or whatever you- yeah, right. You know, whatever. As a blogger, pod, whatever the fuck I am.

38:47.300 --> 38:50.980
As me, I don't want to tell you what it's called, because I don't care.

38:50.980 --> 38:57.860
That's the point I've gotten to with these games. I know people work very hard on them. Again, you know, I-

38:57.860 --> 39:02.100
No, they don't work very hard on them! I'm sorry! I don't see it!

39:02.100 --> 39:06.420
Well, here's the thing. Here's the thing. And tell me if I- I think this chatter is absolutely right.

39:06.420 --> 39:12.020
Sephiroth1215 says, no, they don't care anymore because Jason Enos is gone. That's when DDR went downhill. That's true.

39:12.020 --> 39:12.740
I ran into him-

39:12.740 --> 39:13.780
That is exactly it.

39:13.780 --> 39:16.260
I ran into him a few months ago, actually. He works at EA now.

39:16.260 --> 39:17.460
He doesn't work with them anymore.

39:17.460 --> 39:19.460
Well, he also saw the games live.

39:19.460 --> 39:25.700
Yeah, so, I mean, he's, you know, not there anymore, and you're right. He was really tapped into the family.

39:25.700 --> 39:27.860
He used me so my Sims 3 is good now.

39:27.860 --> 39:32.900
I don't know if I can say what game he's been working on, but I- well, it's- well, I don't know.

39:32.900 --> 39:38.740
Anyway, but it's more casual games, I guess, is what he's doing now. Maybe we'll get him on the show at some point.

39:38.740 --> 39:43.940
I'll shoot an email or something. But, yeah, you know, obviously that was huge.

39:43.940 --> 39:48.660
Well, not just that, but the whole San Francisco office shut down, and that's where a lot of the fans were working on the steps.

39:48.660 --> 39:49.780
I mean, that was huge.

39:49.780 --> 39:54.020
I don't buy that, oh, well, you know, there's people working hard in this game.

39:55.460 --> 39:58.660
Well, that's pretty sad, then, if this is the best you can do.

39:58.660 --> 40:04.580
I mean, because really, all he did was just recycle the whole engine again, maybe change some assets to it,

40:04.580 --> 40:07.460
and just said, okay, what songs are we gonna throw in there now?

40:07.460 --> 40:11.700
All right, here's the licensed songs we want. Okay, let's see what else we can fill up the song list with.

40:11.700 --> 40:13.380
All right, so, look, moving on.

40:13.380 --> 40:15.380
It was our game to advertise their music.

40:15.380 --> 40:17.860
Dance Dance Revolution, awesome if you're 7.

40:17.860 --> 40:26.420
Okay, so, by the way, if you need further proof that Konami does not care about the fans from 10 years ago,

40:26.420 --> 40:29.220
look at what they did to Papa Music on the Wii, right?

40:29.220 --> 40:34.740
They're relaunching Papa Music with this whole new control scheme and, I guess, song lists and stuff.

40:34.740 --> 40:39.620
They say 150 classic tracks will be downloadable at launch.

40:39.620 --> 40:40.900
Is this the new PS3 one?

40:40.900 --> 40:41.400
Yes.

40:41.400 --> 40:44.360
I, to be fair, I might check it out.

40:45.080 --> 40:52.440
The Nostalgia Fanboy in me kind of is curious, but it's a thin line with me right now that they're walking.

40:53.320 --> 40:53.960
Thin line.

40:53.960 --> 40:55.960
You want to see the nature of the train wreck?

40:55.960 --> 41:00.360
Anyhow, because I love DDR at its core.

41:00.360 --> 41:03.320
That's why I get so impassioned about looking at where it's at now.

41:03.320 --> 41:07.480
It's really frustrating when it really isn't that hard to turn this thing around,

41:07.480 --> 41:08.840
but they just don't want to do it.

41:08.840 --> 41:13.160
Anyhow, Karaoke Revolution was also at Konami's booth.

41:13.160 --> 41:16.200
I was surprised at how current the song list was, because they had, like,

41:16.200 --> 41:19.640
My Life Will Suck Without You, Just Dance by Lady Gaga.

41:19.640 --> 41:21.240
They did have some current tracks.

41:21.240 --> 41:25.640
But, honestly, to me, it felt like the same game we had on the PlayStation 2,

41:25.640 --> 41:32.040
without the American Idol stuff now, just with, you know, 720p, slightly souped-up engine.

41:32.040 --> 41:34.360
I didn't see a lot of new stuff in there.

41:34.360 --> 41:37.480
I imagine they're going to have the download store like every other music game now.

41:37.480 --> 41:39.400
Again, you know, and you might think,

41:39.400 --> 41:43.560
Why do I need this when I have Sing Star or when I have Rock Band?

41:43.560 --> 41:45.720
Well, A, you're going to get more pop songs than this.

41:45.720 --> 41:49.160
So I guess its closest competition is really the Sing Star and Lips Games.

41:49.160 --> 41:50.680
And probably the Lips Games suck.

41:50.680 --> 41:55.160
And, well, they actually were debuting a new one on the floor that looked really nice.

41:55.160 --> 41:59.480
I mean, I think the Lips Game looks better than Karaoke Revolution,

41:59.480 --> 42:04.520
but I have a feeling Karaoke Revolution is going to be more of a robust jukebox by the time it's done,

42:04.520 --> 42:07.640
which is kind of sad because Sony owns their own record label.

42:07.640 --> 42:12.920
But when you look at what's available on Sing Star, it's very narrow,

42:12.920 --> 42:17.960
especially when you consider that most of it is UK-based music, which isn't a bad thing.

42:17.960 --> 42:19.480
They have some great music over there,

42:19.480 --> 42:22.600
but not a lot of tunes that are going to be a big hit at parties here in the US,

42:22.600 --> 42:23.800
because nobody's going to know them.

42:24.680 --> 42:26.920
So that is a fair point.

42:27.480 --> 42:31.320
Anyhow, I think that's where Karaoke Revolution may win some people over,

42:31.320 --> 42:35.160
because I think there's a lot of people who haven't taken the plunge into Sing Star or Lips

42:35.160 --> 42:38.280
that might still be able to get brought on board with Karaoke Revolution.

42:38.280 --> 42:39.160
I don't know.

42:39.160 --> 42:41.400
I do have nice things to say about Konami.

42:41.400 --> 42:43.960
One of my favorite games of the show was at their booth,

42:43.960 --> 42:47.800
but before we get to that, I want to talk about one of my favorite games of the show, Period,

42:47.800 --> 42:50.680
which was a music game, Beatles Rock Band.

42:50.680 --> 42:54.200
Yes! Oh my god, I saw the trailer.

42:54.200 --> 42:57.400
Everybody's talking about that introduction and how amazing it is.

42:57.400 --> 43:01.560
And let me tell you, the game itself looks just awesome.

43:01.560 --> 43:04.440
Loki, I don't know, you want to talk about our experience at Beatles Rock Band?

43:04.440 --> 43:07.960
Well, I mean, the thing everybody's harping on, you know,

43:07.960 --> 43:12.920
harmonics and both Activision and that kind of stuff, and EA,

43:13.560 --> 43:18.440
is that they're taking these band-specific games

43:18.440 --> 43:21.000
and they're kind of whoring out their franchise.

43:21.000 --> 43:23.880
Well, the thing with Beatles Rock Band is a little bit different

43:23.880 --> 43:25.720
than, say, what they're doing with the Guitar Hero stuff.

43:25.720 --> 43:29.560
The Guitar Hero games, they're coming out, they're kind of adding, you know,

43:29.560 --> 43:34.760
they're re-skinning it a little bit, you know, and adding the artists that they're focusing on,

43:34.760 --> 43:40.200
or, you know, greatest hits or, you know, or smash hits or just some generic stuff.

43:40.200 --> 43:43.560
But with Beatles Rock Band, they have actually completely redone the game.

43:43.560 --> 43:47.160
Similar with, actually, Lego Rock Band, a little bit.

43:47.160 --> 43:50.520
But with Beatles Rock Band, they've redone the whole style of the game.

43:50.520 --> 43:55.480
It's kind of this, you know, very stylized version of stuff.

43:55.480 --> 43:59.320
The, I like the new things that they're doing now with the Dreamscapes,

43:59.320 --> 44:02.200
which they kind of touched on a little bit in the trailers,

44:02.200 --> 44:06.680
and the intro where you see some really trippy stuff that goes along with the songs.

44:06.680 --> 44:08.840
I mean, that's really cool and different.

44:08.840 --> 44:13.160
And, you know, the three-point harmonies are pretty cool in there,

44:13.160 --> 44:14.840
and how you don't really have to...

44:15.480 --> 44:19.080
Those stages for Here Comes the Sun and Octopus Gardens, those Dreamscapes,

44:19.080 --> 44:20.600
that was amazing.

44:20.600 --> 44:21.160
Amazing.

44:21.960 --> 44:22.460
Yeah.

44:23.080 --> 44:25.080
The three-part harmonies are pretty cool.

44:25.080 --> 44:27.160
How you can, you know, pick which one you want to do.

44:27.160 --> 44:31.160
And just like the little stuff that they've added,

44:31.160 --> 44:36.520
little tweaks to make the game flow better and play better and is more fun.

44:36.520 --> 44:41.000
And that kind of stuff, you know, focusing on the gameplay was really cool.

44:41.000 --> 44:43.240
And they're even a supporter with download content.

44:43.240 --> 44:45.960
Obviously, you're not gonna be able to take Beatles Rock Band

44:45.960 --> 44:49.080
and be able to download the songs to Rock Band 2 or anything like that.

44:49.080 --> 44:52.040
It makes sense because, one, it's a different...

44:52.040 --> 44:55.080
You know, they had an exclusive deal with, you know,

44:55.080 --> 44:58.840
Apple Core and you can't really do that.

44:58.840 --> 45:01.560
And, two, this game also supports the three-part harmonies,

45:01.560 --> 45:03.960
which is currently not in Rock Band,

45:03.960 --> 45:06.600
so you wouldn't be able to really translate that stuff over.

45:06.600 --> 45:09.080
Now, also, I could see that being in maybe Rock Band 3,

45:09.080 --> 45:10.840
you know, whenever that decides to come out.

45:11.480 --> 45:14.120
So maybe that'll be something we'll get in the next game.

45:14.120 --> 45:15.560
But they are working on different things.

45:15.560 --> 45:19.000
Thank you, Harmonix, though, for not putting out a Rock Band 3 this year.

45:19.000 --> 45:19.960
Can I just say that?

45:19.960 --> 45:21.960
Thank you for not showing Rock Band 3.

45:21.960 --> 45:25.320
However, at the same time, you did show Rock Band Lego thing,

45:25.320 --> 45:26.920
which is kind of, like, that's...

45:26.920 --> 45:28.200
I guess, in a way, that's cheating.

45:28.200 --> 45:30.920
It's more for, like, the pop stuff,

45:30.920 --> 45:33.560
like, for the family, you know, type songs,

45:34.200 --> 45:35.800
more pop kind of stuff.

45:35.800 --> 45:37.080
And that was kind of neat looking.

45:38.120 --> 45:41.080
But they are doing the same thing on the Activision side with Band Hero.

45:41.080 --> 45:43.320
They just didn't really show much of it.

45:44.440 --> 45:45.800
Sephiroth1215 says,

45:45.800 --> 45:47.800
Okay, so I say the Beatles can suck it.

45:47.800 --> 45:49.160
Why should I buy this game?

45:49.160 --> 45:49.800
Which is fair.

45:49.800 --> 45:52.200
Not everybody respects the classic music stuff,

45:52.200 --> 45:54.600
or, you know, music might not be for everybody.

45:54.600 --> 45:55.400
But I'll tell you what.

45:56.600 --> 45:57.160
Here's the thing.

45:57.160 --> 45:57.720
And somebody...

45:57.720 --> 45:59.080
I don't know if I overheard this at the booth,

45:59.080 --> 45:59.800
or somebody told me this,

45:59.800 --> 46:00.920
and I apologize if it was you,

46:00.920 --> 46:02.200
and I'm not giving you credit.

46:02.200 --> 46:03.320
But somebody said,

46:03.320 --> 46:04.360
You know what?

46:04.360 --> 46:04.920
No matter...

46:06.680 --> 46:09.000
No matter what kind of music you listen to,

46:09.000 --> 46:11.480
you hear these songs in the Beatles games.

46:11.480 --> 46:14.920
You can't help but hum along or recognize these songs.

46:14.920 --> 46:17.160
How often do you play Rock Band or Rock Band 2,

46:17.160 --> 46:17.800
and like, you're like,

46:17.800 --> 46:19.000
I've never heard that song before.

46:19.000 --> 46:20.360
And I can't do that song.

46:20.360 --> 46:21.400
But like with the Beatles songs,

46:21.400 --> 46:22.840
there's an awful lot of them.

46:22.840 --> 46:23.960
You just know.

46:23.960 --> 46:26.120
Because they are so embedded in our culture.

46:26.120 --> 46:28.680
You know a lot of these songs.

46:28.680 --> 46:30.120
I think that's a big part of it.

46:30.120 --> 46:31.160
Plus, for me,

46:32.120 --> 46:33.640
the Rock Band Beatles,

46:33.640 --> 46:35.960
that's the way to do an artist's game.

46:35.960 --> 46:38.040
It makes the Guitar Hero,

46:38.040 --> 46:39.160
Aerosmith games,

46:39.160 --> 46:40.600
and Van Halen games,

46:40.600 --> 46:43.720
and Metallica games look like cheap reskins.

46:43.720 --> 46:44.440
Can you imagine,

46:44.440 --> 46:46.280
like, if they did like a Pink Floyd,

46:46.280 --> 46:48.600
or something really trippy and stuff,

46:48.600 --> 46:50.440
with like a Rock Band type thing.

46:50.440 --> 46:52.440
The same different stylized stuff,

46:52.440 --> 46:54.360
or like a Gorillaz game,

46:54.360 --> 46:55.400
or something like that.

46:55.400 --> 46:56.440
Same, you know,

46:56.440 --> 46:58.760
stylized way.

46:58.760 --> 47:01.240
Just they should change it up with each artist if they do it.

47:01.240 --> 47:02.520
And then they would be really cool.

47:04.360 --> 47:06.280
You know, I just think this is the way to do it.

47:06.280 --> 47:07.560
And by the way,

47:07.560 --> 47:10.200
if you don't understand what I meant earlier

47:10.200 --> 47:12.760
about how DDR needs to kind of, you know,

47:12.760 --> 47:14.440
innovate itself and change,

47:14.440 --> 47:16.280
this is a perfect example.

47:16.280 --> 47:17.000
You know what I mean?

47:17.000 --> 47:19.720
Like, when my expectations going into this,

47:19.720 --> 47:21.480
because of all the other music games I've seen lately,

47:21.480 --> 47:22.360
were very low,

47:22.360 --> 47:23.720
going in to look at the Beatles Rock Band,

47:23.720 --> 47:25.160
and just kind of seeing that they've really made it

47:25.160 --> 47:26.920
like a Beatles experience.

47:27.480 --> 47:29.000
I was like, wow,

47:29.000 --> 47:31.240
they know how to do it.

47:31.240 --> 47:32.120
And honestly,

47:32.120 --> 47:34.360
I think other companies could be really learning a lot from this,

47:34.360 --> 47:35.560
and hopefully they are.

47:35.560 --> 47:36.060
I don't know.

47:37.240 --> 47:38.120
So I just, you know,

47:38.920 --> 47:39.400
it just,

47:39.400 --> 47:41.480
it felt like,

47:41.480 --> 47:43.480
it's so hard for me to put into words.

47:43.480 --> 47:45.560
It's something you have to see for yourself, I guess.

47:45.560 --> 47:47.240
But it feels,

47:47.240 --> 47:49.080
it doesn't feel like a cheap reskinning

47:49.080 --> 47:50.280
or a cash-in type game.

47:50.280 --> 47:53.560
It feels like a Beatles tribute.

47:54.840 --> 47:55.340
It's great.

47:57.960 --> 47:59.720
Yeah, so we watched some people play that,

47:59.720 --> 48:00.840
and it was cool,

48:00.840 --> 48:01.480
and, you know.

48:02.280 --> 48:03.160
Lego Rock Band,

48:03.160 --> 48:04.840
since that got brought up a minute ago.

48:04.840 --> 48:06.600
I'm not as excited about that.

48:06.600 --> 48:09.400
Now that does look like a cheap reskinning of an old game.

48:09.400 --> 48:10.360
I gotta be honest.

48:10.360 --> 48:10.760
Yeah.

48:10.760 --> 48:12.920
Yeah, it's gonna have the pop songs and all that stuff,

48:12.920 --> 48:15.320
which I suppose is gonna make or break the deal,

48:15.320 --> 48:17.240
and it's, you know, for the kids or what have you.

48:17.240 --> 48:19.400
But I was a little,

48:19.400 --> 48:21.480
I literally was looking at Lego Rock Band going,

48:21.480 --> 48:23.720
this just looks like Rock Band 2 with Lego people.

48:23.720 --> 48:25.160
They didn't really show off a lot of stuff

48:25.160 --> 48:26.040
that they were talking about though.

48:26.040 --> 48:27.240
Remember with Lego Rock Band,

48:27.240 --> 48:28.200
they said they're gonna have like,

48:28.200 --> 48:29.800
kind of an adventure mode type stuff,

48:29.800 --> 48:30.760
where you, you know,

48:30.760 --> 48:32.920
battle monsters and whatnot while,

48:32.920 --> 48:34.280
you know, playing music,

48:34.280 --> 48:35.400
that kind of stuff.

48:35.400 --> 48:37.320
So that might be something kind of neat,

48:37.320 --> 48:38.840
and the soundtrack really kind of

48:40.680 --> 48:42.440
would make or break this game, I think.

48:43.000 --> 48:44.280
But right now,

48:44.280 --> 48:45.800
no, it's hard to say.

48:45.800 --> 48:46.520
It just looks neat,

48:47.160 --> 48:49.480
because you can rock out into a Lego pirate ship

48:49.480 --> 48:50.200
and that kind of stuff.

48:50.760 --> 48:52.280
I mean, that's just kind of neat.

48:52.280 --> 48:53.160
I'd do that anyway.

48:53.160 --> 48:54.280
And in the end, you know,

48:54.280 --> 48:56.360
it really, you don't have to buy this game.

48:56.360 --> 48:58.120
I mean, it's just optional.

48:58.120 --> 49:00.840
If it's something that you think would be cool,

49:00.840 --> 49:02.280
cool, pick it up,

49:02.280 --> 49:03.640
and you know,

49:05.080 --> 49:06.120
it's only, I mean,

49:06.120 --> 49:07.720
I don't think it's being sold in the bundles, so.

49:09.400 --> 49:10.920
Two things Bobby wants me to point out.

49:10.920 --> 49:11.880
A, on the Beatles game,

49:11.880 --> 49:14.760
a, you do not fill in with the drums anymore.

49:14.760 --> 49:17.480
You just hit a green note that's optional.

49:17.480 --> 49:18.840
It won't break your combo,

49:18.840 --> 49:19.880
and it will,

49:19.880 --> 49:22.040
some of the green notes turn into your activation thing,

49:22.040 --> 49:23.320
and then if you hit it, it does that.

49:23.320 --> 49:24.600
Because, and this makes sense,

49:24.600 --> 49:26.360
the Beatles songs did not have fill-ins,

49:26.360 --> 49:28.840
and they don't want to change up the music or what have you.

49:28.840 --> 49:30.120
So, makes sense.

49:30.120 --> 49:31.800
They made a pretty big altercation there

49:31.800 --> 49:32.840
in the drum parts with that.

49:33.480 --> 49:34.120
Alteration?

49:34.680 --> 49:35.080
I guess.

49:36.040 --> 49:39.960
Black Wolf in chat also kind of sent me this

49:39.960 --> 49:41.160
as kind of like a food for thought,

49:41.160 --> 49:44.440
and I actually think it's a really interesting theory.

49:44.440 --> 49:45.560
I want to read this.

49:45.560 --> 49:47.960
The conspiracy behind Lego Rock Band.

49:47.960 --> 49:50.840
Think about which music company's CEO felt

49:50.840 --> 49:52.360
that they aren't getting enough money

49:52.360 --> 49:54.440
from licensing for music games.

49:54.440 --> 49:57.160
Now think about which company is publishing Lego Rock Band.

49:57.720 --> 50:00.680
Now realize that download content for Lego Rock Band

50:00.680 --> 50:03.000
is not compatible with Rock Band 2.

50:03.000 --> 50:03.880
Connect the dots.

50:07.240 --> 50:09.800
That's an amazing thought, actually,

50:09.800 --> 50:12.840
and something I think a lot of people are overlooking.

50:12.840 --> 50:14.520
That probably has a lot to do with it.

50:14.520 --> 50:15.640
Absolutely.

50:15.640 --> 50:15.960
Probably.

50:15.960 --> 50:17.320
Because, right, isn't Warner putting out the...

50:17.320 --> 50:18.040
Yes, it is.

50:18.040 --> 50:20.920
And which record label was having a big stink?

50:20.920 --> 50:21.320
Uh-huh.

50:22.760 --> 50:24.280
I think you've stumbled onto something, Bobby.

50:24.280 --> 50:24.680
Good job.

50:24.680 --> 50:25.640
Gold star.

50:25.640 --> 50:27.080
He is Scooby Snack.

50:27.080 --> 50:27.580
All right.

50:28.920 --> 50:32.520
We share the radio night with you here on All Games

50:32.520 --> 50:33.480
for a reason, Bobby.

50:33.480 --> 50:36.360
I didn't see the DJ game for the DS there,

50:36.360 --> 50:40.200
and I also didn't see that other Army member in DJ game.

50:40.760 --> 50:41.560
No, which is a bummer.

50:41.560 --> 50:42.760
I was looking forward to seeing that, too.

50:43.800 --> 50:45.400
No DJ Max stuff, either.

50:45.400 --> 50:47.240
I know we have some fans of DJ Max.

50:47.240 --> 50:49.560
I didn't see an appearance from that company, either.

50:49.560 --> 50:49.800
No.

50:49.800 --> 50:51.720
So nothing there at the show, anyway.

50:51.720 --> 50:52.840
Well, they're kind of small.

50:52.840 --> 50:55.000
I mean, in the grand scheme of things.

50:55.000 --> 50:55.500
Yeah.

50:56.200 --> 50:58.120
And those folks that were thinking that,

50:58.120 --> 51:00.760
oh, Kensha Hall is lost and gone and what have you,

51:01.320 --> 51:03.480
you could still feel their presence there a little bit.

51:03.480 --> 51:07.640
But in the space that would have been taken up by Blizzard

51:07.640 --> 51:09.720
and some of these other companies that didn't come to E3

51:09.720 --> 51:11.800
this year, they did have some of the old Kensha Hall,

51:11.800 --> 51:12.680
like DDR game.

51:14.520 --> 51:16.600
They're always there at E3 showing off their hard pads

51:16.600 --> 51:17.000
and stuff.

51:17.000 --> 51:18.600
They were there doing their thing.

51:18.600 --> 51:21.400
So they still have some of the old Kensha Hall companies

51:21.400 --> 51:23.160
are making a showing in the Indiecade,

51:23.160 --> 51:24.280
which was kind of cool.

51:25.000 --> 51:26.120
So all right.

51:26.760 --> 51:27.480
What do we want to do?

51:27.480 --> 51:32.440
Let's talk about some of the press conferences.

51:32.440 --> 51:32.920
Why not?

51:32.920 --> 51:35.960
I know you guys probably have heard all that you wanted

51:35.960 --> 51:37.000
to hear on the press conferences.

51:37.000 --> 51:38.280
I just want to recap.

51:38.280 --> 51:40.680
Give you guys a chance to give your input on the press

51:40.680 --> 51:41.720
conferences what you thought.

51:41.720 --> 51:43.960
I was following Twitter during a lot of this too.

51:43.960 --> 51:44.600
Were you?

51:44.600 --> 51:45.880
Because I was at work.

51:46.520 --> 51:49.640
And of course, I can't get on to watch any of the stuff.

51:49.640 --> 51:51.080
But I was getting feedback through Twitter.

51:51.080 --> 51:52.200
And there's some very interesting things.

51:52.200 --> 51:52.840
I stayed home.

51:53.960 --> 51:56.200
You know what pissed me off on the Twitter thing?

51:56.200 --> 51:59.720
People that declared Microsoft one before Sony was done.

52:00.360 --> 52:00.920
Shut up.

52:00.920 --> 52:02.120
Shut up.

52:02.120 --> 52:03.480
You know that all the good stuff.

52:03.480 --> 52:05.000
I mean, fanboy.

52:05.000 --> 52:06.360
Hello, fanboy.

52:07.080 --> 52:08.520
Sony was not even done yet.

52:08.520 --> 52:11.080
Of course, they left their feathers in the cap until the end.

52:11.080 --> 52:12.840
Call me a Sony fanboy if you want.

52:12.840 --> 52:14.120
But go back in the archives of the show.

52:14.120 --> 52:15.080
We've been highly critical.

52:15.080 --> 52:16.120
I left it open ended.

52:16.120 --> 52:20.200
I'm like, Microsoft has won this unless Sony really brings

52:20.200 --> 52:22.920
something to the table that's outstanding.

52:22.920 --> 52:24.840
Because if they brought what they brought last year,

52:25.880 --> 52:28.120
then I don't know.

52:28.120 --> 52:31.560
Nintendo, I'm sorry, we'll get into that.

52:31.560 --> 52:32.840
Well, here's the thing.

52:32.840 --> 52:35.000
Of the three press conferences, before we go over each one

52:35.000 --> 52:36.920
in detail, if you had to pick a winner,

52:36.920 --> 52:38.280
if you asked me to pick a winner,

52:38.280 --> 52:39.480
you know what I'd tell you?

52:39.480 --> 52:40.760
There was no winner.

52:40.760 --> 52:41.640
There was no winner.

52:42.680 --> 52:44.040
Or everybody was a winner.

52:44.920 --> 52:47.000
It really depended on what you were looking

52:47.000 --> 52:48.600
for this year in the games.

52:48.600 --> 52:53.000
And honestly, I think Microsoft had a lot of great ideas.

52:53.720 --> 52:56.680
I think Sony had a lot of great implementations.

52:56.680 --> 53:00.280
And I think Nintendo, well, they'll always have soccer moms.

53:02.680 --> 53:05.800
Nintendo had a lot of last year.

53:05.800 --> 53:06.920
Oh, and then this.

53:07.800 --> 53:11.240
That's pretty much what we had from Nintendo.

53:12.040 --> 53:13.640
The chat room is speaking up.

53:13.640 --> 53:15.320
Bobby Acteft and some other folks saying,

53:15.320 --> 53:16.280
the winners are gamers.

53:16.280 --> 53:17.000
And that's true.

53:17.640 --> 53:20.040
And I was commenting to Loki this as I was walking

53:20.040 --> 53:21.400
around the show floor.

53:21.400 --> 53:22.360
I was like, you know what?

53:22.360 --> 53:24.840
I haven't really played a shitty game yet this year.

53:24.840 --> 53:26.600
Usually the E3, there's a lot of games

53:26.600 --> 53:27.800
there's a real stinker of a game.

53:27.800 --> 53:29.640
I'm kind of like, oh, I don't know about this.

53:29.640 --> 53:30.680
I take that back.

53:30.680 --> 53:32.200
I did play the Beatles one.

53:33.320 --> 53:36.360
Hey, reuniting who Microsoft did on stage.

53:36.360 --> 53:38.440
It was an impressive feat for their press conference.

53:38.440 --> 53:40.280
So I do give Microsoft props for that.

53:40.280 --> 53:41.560
Loki, you did find a shitty game.

53:41.560 --> 53:42.920
I did find a shitty game.

53:42.920 --> 53:44.520
And I can't remember what it's like.

53:45.480 --> 53:46.600
It's a Konami game.

53:46.600 --> 53:47.240
Surprise.

53:48.040 --> 53:50.760
But it was actually, it was like Zephyr the elemental

53:50.760 --> 53:51.880
or something like that.

53:51.880 --> 53:54.360
It was supposed to be, it was the one that they had.

53:54.360 --> 53:56.040
It's like tornado something or other.

53:56.040 --> 53:57.800
It was the working title for it.

53:57.800 --> 54:00.680
And it's supposed to be like Katamari where you're this,

54:00.680 --> 54:04.440
you know, tornado and you, you know, knock over things

54:04.440 --> 54:06.760
and you get bigger as you collect more things.

54:06.760 --> 54:08.200
Isn't this game already on Xbox Live marketplace?

54:08.200 --> 54:09.800
It should be a vornado game.

54:09.800 --> 54:10.760
Yeah, basically.

54:10.760 --> 54:11.800
And it sucked.

54:11.800 --> 54:12.840
It was boring.

54:12.840 --> 54:14.920
So no, I don't like that game.

54:14.920 --> 54:16.600
That is my stinker game of E3.

54:17.240 --> 54:19.400
I feel the need to say something nice about Konami

54:19.400 --> 54:20.760
because we've been giving them a hard time.

54:20.760 --> 54:24.520
And to be fair, Konami did show a couple of great things

54:24.520 --> 54:25.240
at the show.

54:25.240 --> 54:27.240
So before we get into the press conferences, to be fair,

54:27.240 --> 54:27.960
I want to say this.

54:28.920 --> 54:31.640
The Saw game actually looks interesting.

54:32.200 --> 54:32.840
You know what?

54:34.040 --> 54:36.920
I can admit when I may not have been right about something

54:36.920 --> 54:40.360
before and I don't know if I would necessarily want to buy

54:40.360 --> 54:43.240
the Saw game because I think it would be too intense for me.

54:43.880 --> 54:46.360
But I think, you know, in observing watching other people

54:46.360 --> 54:48.920
play and what they were going for and so forth,

54:48.920 --> 54:51.560
I think the Saw game actually looks kind of interesting.

54:51.560 --> 54:53.160
The graphics were certainly really good.

54:53.160 --> 54:56.200
It kind of has a Silent Hill-ish look to it.

54:56.200 --> 54:57.960
But you can definitely see the distinction.

54:57.960 --> 55:00.440
It is not about psychological.

55:00.440 --> 55:03.960
It's about like in your face, blood and gore.

55:03.960 --> 55:06.520
Like, you know, seeing that scene where the guy reaches

55:06.520 --> 55:08.200
in the toilet and pulls his hand up and he's got all

55:08.200 --> 55:08.920
the needles in it.

55:08.920 --> 55:10.200
That's just nasty.

55:10.200 --> 55:11.240
Okay, but there's a fan.

55:11.240 --> 55:14.200
There's people out there for that that's just nasty.

55:14.200 --> 55:17.640
And I got to say, if you're a Fangoria type person,

55:17.640 --> 55:19.800
Saw is probably going to appeal to you.

55:19.800 --> 55:21.080
It's not terrible.

55:21.080 --> 55:23.640
I still would never put any money into it, even if it was

55:23.640 --> 55:25.640
the best game in the planet, just so I don't support

55:25.640 --> 55:26.280
the franchise.

55:27.400 --> 55:28.840
Seriously, that's how I feel.

55:28.840 --> 55:33.240
Well, I'm trying to put the personal thoughts on that aside

55:33.240 --> 55:34.840
and just evaluate the game itself.

55:34.840 --> 55:39.720
And the game is not looking, considering it's a movie tie-in

55:39.720 --> 55:43.240
game, it looks like it's raising the bar on those a little bit.

55:43.240 --> 55:45.000
I just don't think I can, in good conscience,

55:45.000 --> 55:46.360
say anything positive about it.

55:47.720 --> 55:48.280
All right.

55:48.280 --> 55:51.800
All right, well, I do want to say, though, a game that was

55:51.800 --> 55:54.840
incredible at Konami's booth that I played, and not quite

55:54.840 --> 55:56.840
my favorite game of the show, but just about my favorite

55:56.840 --> 55:58.680
game of the show was Silent Hill Shattered Memories

55:58.680 --> 55:59.160
on the Wii.

55:59.720 --> 56:04.680
Oh, my gosh, this game was great, especially, and I hate

56:04.680 --> 56:09.560
to say this, but for a Wii game, like, it was really...

56:09.560 --> 56:10.280
I love it.

56:10.280 --> 56:11.560
It runs really smooth.

56:11.560 --> 56:12.760
It runs smooth.

56:12.760 --> 56:14.440
It looks nice.

56:14.440 --> 56:19.480
You know, it doesn't look like a high definition, but it

56:19.480 --> 56:20.760
looks pretty good.

56:20.760 --> 56:24.680
And, you know, a game doesn't have to necessarily look

56:24.680 --> 56:26.200
incredible to be fun.

56:27.080 --> 56:31.880
And I love the whole using the flashlight with the Wiimote

56:31.880 --> 56:33.160
kind of looking around.

56:33.160 --> 56:35.000
I love the way it controlled.

56:35.000 --> 56:38.840
It was definitely kind of scary in parts, like when the things

56:38.840 --> 56:40.840
would jump out of the darkness on you.

56:40.840 --> 56:43.960
I think the game is going to piss off hardcore fans of

56:43.960 --> 56:46.120
the Silent Hill because it looks like they've really changed

56:46.120 --> 56:47.320
up this first game.

56:47.320 --> 56:48.520
But you know what?

56:48.520 --> 56:49.800
I'm okay with it.

56:49.800 --> 56:52.920
As someone who is casually a Silent Hill fan, I think it's

56:52.920 --> 56:53.720
pretty cool.

56:53.720 --> 56:55.720
I like some of the changes they've made.

56:56.680 --> 56:57.960
It's engrossing.

56:57.960 --> 56:59.080
It's scary.

56:59.080 --> 57:03.000
It's going to be a lot of fun, and it's a good non-party

57:03.000 --> 57:03.880
Wii game.

57:03.880 --> 57:04.360
Hooray!

57:04.920 --> 57:08.600
This is what I have to say for people who, you know, fuss

57:08.600 --> 57:09.640
just because of changes.

57:10.360 --> 57:12.680
Without change, we'd have stagnation, and with stagnation,

57:12.680 --> 57:14.200
we'd have death.

57:14.200 --> 57:18.120
So if you want the franchise to die, then don't look forward

57:18.120 --> 57:19.000
to any changes in it.

57:19.560 --> 57:21.560
You know, don't, don't, you know, be...

57:21.560 --> 57:23.960
But to be honest, I, you know, and I haven't played enough

57:23.960 --> 57:26.760
of the first game, but I had a very hard time even seeing

57:26.760 --> 57:28.280
the correlations in the first game.

57:28.280 --> 57:29.720
I know they must be in there somewhere.

57:29.720 --> 57:30.680
Somebody mentioned something.

57:30.680 --> 57:32.840
I was reading on the forum somewhere about how dare they

57:32.840 --> 57:36.200
make Dahlia look hot and sexy and all this stuff.

57:36.200 --> 57:38.520
And you know, I guess they've made some big, big changes

57:38.520 --> 57:39.320
to the first game.

57:39.320 --> 57:40.760
But she was kind of a hoe.

57:40.760 --> 57:42.360
I honestly, whatever.

57:42.360 --> 57:43.720
The game was fun.

57:43.720 --> 57:47.240
The changes are being made based on how you answer, like,

57:47.240 --> 57:48.680
some of this personality stuff.

57:48.680 --> 57:50.520
So it kind of changes it.

57:50.520 --> 57:52.600
It's almost like, you know, how, like, different things

57:52.600 --> 57:56.040
manifest based on, you know, the characters, you know,

57:56.040 --> 57:58.360
intentions and, like, desires and that kind of stuff.

57:58.360 --> 57:59.640
There's some pretty personal stuff in there.

57:59.640 --> 58:00.920
I always remember Silent Hill 2.

58:00.920 --> 58:04.600
The little girl never saw any of the, um, any of the monsters

58:04.600 --> 58:07.320
or anything, that all the adults had their own special

58:07.880 --> 58:08.840
monsters, right?

58:08.840 --> 58:10.280
Yeah, it's something like that.

58:10.280 --> 58:12.360
The very first thing the game does is it gives you, like,

58:12.360 --> 58:14.760
a seven or eight question psychological evaluation.

58:14.760 --> 58:16.760
There's some very strange questions in there, like,

58:16.760 --> 58:18.520
have you ever cheated on a partner?

58:18.520 --> 58:21.000
And it's supposed to be you answering them as you,

58:21.000 --> 58:21.960
not as the character.

58:22.760 --> 58:24.440
Have you ever role played during sex?

58:24.440 --> 58:26.520
And all these, like, very, very personal questions.

58:26.520 --> 58:27.560
And of course, as I was taking it,

58:27.560 --> 58:29.960
I was trying to make myself sound like the most messed

58:29.960 --> 58:31.480
up person on the planet, right?

58:32.120 --> 58:33.960
So, um, you know, I'm curious.

58:33.960 --> 58:35.640
I didn't really see what impact that's going to have

58:35.640 --> 58:37.560
on the game, but it looked interesting.

58:37.560 --> 58:41.960
So it is not all boos and jeers at Konami's booth.

58:41.960 --> 58:44.920
Silent Hill Shattered Memories was definitely a huge yay.

58:44.920 --> 58:47.080
So I did want to get that out there at some point.

58:47.080 --> 58:49.480
Okay, now we'll talk about press conferences, shall we?

58:49.480 --> 58:52.280
Actually, I should read some comments from chat, actually.

58:52.280 --> 58:56.280
Uh, unfolded raptor talking about the saw game.

58:56.280 --> 58:58.600
There is one where you have to close stall doors and read

58:58.600 --> 59:01.160
the backwards number in the bloodstain mirror in the room

59:01.160 --> 59:03.240
and put in the combination for the lock in order to get

59:03.240 --> 59:03.880
to the next room.

59:03.880 --> 59:06.120
Yeah, that puzzle was in the demo and it's, you know,

59:06.120 --> 59:08.280
it was an interesting puzzle.

59:08.280 --> 59:10.600
It was, you know, kind of a neat little gameplay mechanic.

59:10.600 --> 59:11.320
I thought it was cool.

59:12.040 --> 59:14.600
GS68 says, well, they didn't show gore.

59:14.600 --> 59:16.440
I think he meant to say, but they showed 3d stuff

59:16.440 --> 59:17.880
and some disgusting shit.

59:17.880 --> 59:20.440
And that's why I don't think in the end I could actually

59:20.440 --> 59:21.400
play the saw game.

59:22.200 --> 59:26.280
But, um, you know, the parts I saw that where people

59:26.280 --> 59:30.600
weren't losing looked just fine, but I don't think I'd be

59:30.600 --> 59:32.200
able to play the game myself.

59:32.200 --> 59:34.520
Isn't that weird to kind of say that about a video game?

59:34.520 --> 59:37.160
Like, yes, it might be nice for those of you that are into

59:37.160 --> 59:38.840
that kind of thing, but, uh, not me.

59:40.360 --> 59:42.040
Whatever sinks your battleship.

59:42.040 --> 59:42.600
Exactly.

59:43.480 --> 59:43.960
I'm sorry.

59:43.960 --> 59:45.800
GS68 wasn't talking about the saw game.

59:47.160 --> 59:50.120
Oh God, he was talking about Phantom 8, 2009 hentai room.

59:50.120 --> 59:51.000
Oh, sorry about that.

59:51.000 --> 59:55.160
I was looking up the look in the notes there, but I'm sure

59:55.160 --> 59:57.400
the saw game has some pretty disgusting shit in it too.

59:57.400 --> 59:58.360
In fact, I know it does.

59:58.360 --> 01:00:01.000
I did see some disgusting real quick before we go on to

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:01.880
the conferences.

01:00:01.880 --> 01:00:04.440
I was going to mention some of the other announcements.

01:00:04.440 --> 01:00:05.960
From Konami real quick.

01:00:07.480 --> 01:00:10.040
Of course, some stuff that actually didn't make like the

01:00:10.040 --> 01:00:14.760
keynotes, um, Kojima Productions announced Metal Gear Solid

01:00:14.760 --> 01:00:16.120
or Metal Gear Arcade.

01:00:18.040 --> 01:00:18.600
Okay.

01:00:18.600 --> 01:00:19.640
Which is kind of neat.

01:00:19.640 --> 01:00:23.880
And, um, they also, um, you may remember there was that

01:00:23.880 --> 01:00:27.080
Castlevania type game that they were, you know, previewing

01:00:27.080 --> 01:00:28.840
that wasn't really Castlevania.

01:00:28.840 --> 01:00:31.240
Well, it ended up being Castlevania and it's actually being

01:00:31.240 --> 01:00:33.240
done by Kojima, which is pretty cool.

01:00:33.240 --> 01:00:35.160
No, I read, I heard about that.

01:00:35.160 --> 01:00:36.040
That's going to be cool.

01:00:36.040 --> 01:00:37.880
Patrick Stewart has a voice in it.

01:00:37.880 --> 01:00:40.040
That makes it like infinitely cool.

01:00:40.040 --> 01:00:40.520
Yes.

01:00:40.520 --> 01:00:43.400
So that was definitely a big yay from Konami.

01:00:43.400 --> 01:00:44.680
So hooray for you guys.

01:00:44.680 --> 01:00:45.880
He's going to be Dracula.

01:00:45.880 --> 01:00:46.680
I don't, I don't know.

01:00:46.680 --> 01:00:48.360
Imagine Patrick Stewart is Dracula.

01:00:48.360 --> 01:00:50.600
I hope this is a game they're showing up on the floor next

01:00:50.600 --> 01:00:51.160
year.

01:00:51.160 --> 01:00:52.520
That would be fantastic.

01:00:52.520 --> 01:00:54.760
I mean, cause he can do the scary voice.

01:00:54.760 --> 01:00:58.600
Patrick Warburton as, uh, you know, one of the Belmonts.

01:00:59.880 --> 01:01:00.600
That'd be funny.

01:01:00.600 --> 01:01:05.480
Ah, and then of course, and then of course, the kind of go

01:01:05.480 --> 01:01:07.160
back to music games.

01:01:07.160 --> 01:01:09.640
Also, Konami announced that they're, they are bringing over

01:01:09.640 --> 01:01:12.040
that pop music for Wii with no controller.

01:01:12.040 --> 01:01:15.560
Once again, really, that's not pop music.

01:01:15.560 --> 01:01:18.200
Like you folks that have been following Konami for 10 years

01:01:18.200 --> 01:01:19.240
will think it is.

01:01:19.240 --> 01:01:21.640
So don't, you know what, do yourself a favor.

01:01:21.640 --> 01:01:23.160
Hardcore Bomani fans.

01:01:23.160 --> 01:01:25.640
Don't think of this game as pop music because you are just

01:01:25.640 --> 01:01:27.400
going to be disappointed and don't buy it.

01:01:27.400 --> 01:01:30.920
Well, I, it's not fair to say that until I've actually had

01:01:30.920 --> 01:01:32.040
my hands on it playing it.

01:01:32.040 --> 01:01:34.520
So I'm not going to say that, but I'm going to say, don't

01:01:34.520 --> 01:01:36.040
think of it as pop music because you're only going to

01:01:36.040 --> 01:01:37.640
set yourself up for disappointment.

01:01:37.640 --> 01:01:38.140
Yeah.

01:01:39.480 --> 01:01:41.560
But Lord, the Shadow looks awesome.

01:01:42.840 --> 01:01:44.440
That's like a Castlevania game.

01:01:44.440 --> 01:01:44.840
All right.

01:01:44.840 --> 01:01:47.320
So let's, uh, let's talk about press conferences here.

01:01:47.320 --> 01:01:48.280
We're an hour into the show.

01:01:48.280 --> 01:01:50.040
We haven't even touched on a single press conference yet.

01:01:50.040 --> 01:01:52.440
So let's, let's talk about the big press conferences so far.

01:01:52.440 --> 01:01:53.560
Um, where do you want to start?

01:01:53.560 --> 01:01:54.280
How about Nintendo?

01:01:54.280 --> 01:01:55.960
I guess we were ragging on Nintendo a little bit.

01:01:55.960 --> 01:01:57.400
We'll start with them.

01:01:57.400 --> 01:02:00.200
Uh, some of the things that they mentioned, well, not all

01:02:00.200 --> 01:02:01.640
the news was bad out of Nintendo.

01:02:01.640 --> 01:02:03.800
I mean, certainly Metroid, other M, how about this?

01:02:03.800 --> 01:02:06.520
Team Ninja teams up with Nintendo to put out the

01:02:06.520 --> 01:02:07.560
next Metroid game.

01:02:07.560 --> 01:02:13.240
The only good announcement out of, out of their press

01:02:13.240 --> 01:02:13.720
conference.

01:02:13.720 --> 01:02:16.920
And seriously, if they hadn't announced this, I would have

01:02:16.920 --> 01:02:18.280
had no hope for them.

01:02:19.880 --> 01:02:22.840
Well, this was definitely the thing to cater to the, uh,

01:02:22.840 --> 01:02:24.120
hardcore gamers.

01:02:24.120 --> 01:02:26.760
Yes, it's a good example of how to revitalize your

01:02:26.760 --> 01:02:27.320
franchise.

01:02:27.320 --> 01:02:29.160
Have someone else do it.

01:02:29.160 --> 01:02:31.240
But we don't have, um, Itagaki.

01:02:32.840 --> 01:02:35.240
Yeah, I know that is a little weird because it's Team Ninja

01:02:35.240 --> 01:02:37.320
without their, their freaking rock star.

01:02:37.320 --> 01:02:39.880
But you know, the, the trailer looked promising.

01:02:39.880 --> 01:02:41.640
It definitely looks like a kick in the butt to the

01:02:41.640 --> 01:02:44.360
franchise, which, you know, I guess even though I, that

01:02:44.360 --> 01:02:46.520
means this, uh, that just means that Samus won't have,

01:02:46.520 --> 01:02:47.480
you know, boob mechanics.

01:02:48.120 --> 01:02:51.880
Prime was all right, but yeah, I was missing my 2D Metroid

01:02:51.880 --> 01:02:52.920
and this is going to give it to me.

01:02:52.920 --> 01:02:55.000
Prime did not do it for me.

01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:58.120
I just couldn't get in the prime and corruptions, you

01:02:58.120 --> 01:02:59.320
know, look kind of dumb.

01:02:59.880 --> 01:03:01.800
Um, but this looks awesome.

01:03:01.800 --> 01:03:03.960
This looks like something that could actually play and

01:03:03.960 --> 01:03:04.680
would want to play.

01:03:05.880 --> 01:03:07.800
Let's talk about some of the other things that came out of

01:03:07.800 --> 01:03:09.400
the Nintendo press conference now.

01:03:09.400 --> 01:03:10.920
So you said that was the one thing.

01:03:10.920 --> 01:03:12.920
What about New Super Mario Brothers Wii?

01:03:12.920 --> 01:03:15.000
The four player game on the Wii.

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:17.000
This is the very first game I played on the show floor,

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:17.320
by the way.

01:03:17.320 --> 01:03:21.400
It's the four player, uh, like basically it's New Super

01:03:21.400 --> 01:03:22.440
Mario Brothers from the DS.

01:03:22.440 --> 01:03:24.120
They're like, they had like a battle mode or something in

01:03:24.120 --> 01:03:24.760
it, I think.

01:03:24.760 --> 01:03:27.480
Now it's on the Wii and four people at once can play.

01:03:27.480 --> 01:03:28.840
It's, it's stupid.

01:03:28.840 --> 01:03:30.360
You know why it's stupid?

01:03:30.360 --> 01:03:32.520
It's because it's just porting basically the game from the

01:03:32.520 --> 01:03:33.160
DS.

01:03:33.160 --> 01:03:36.520
And yeah, I know it's a new, new game and stuff, but really

01:03:36.520 --> 01:03:40.280
for, unless, you know, you're really in the party games and

01:03:40.280 --> 01:03:42.600
really into playing this with like, you know, four people

01:03:42.600 --> 01:03:46.280
at once, which that's fine because, you know, the Wii is

01:03:46.280 --> 01:03:48.440
for a lot of people that want to do party games and stuff

01:03:48.440 --> 01:03:48.840
like that.

01:03:48.840 --> 01:03:51.320
But I just couldn't see myself breaking this out at a party

01:03:51.320 --> 01:03:52.280
and playing this game.

01:03:52.280 --> 01:03:54.920
It'd be like, you know, the regular New Super Mario

01:03:54.920 --> 01:03:55.320
Brothers.

01:03:55.320 --> 01:03:58.760
I played through it myself and that's it.

01:03:58.760 --> 01:04:01.160
This game, if I play through it myself, I'm not going to

01:04:01.160 --> 01:04:02.680
really get anything out of it.

01:04:02.680 --> 01:04:03.640
And that's the problem.

01:04:04.680 --> 01:04:06.760
Yeah, I played this on the show floor, like I said, and it

01:04:06.760 --> 01:04:07.640
was fun.

01:04:07.640 --> 01:04:10.200
It was, it was, you know, it's neat for people.

01:04:10.200 --> 01:04:12.600
It was a lot of fun and very competitive, but don't be

01:04:12.600 --> 01:04:13.640
mistaken, folks.

01:04:13.640 --> 01:04:18.280
This is another party game on the Wii in Mario's clothing.

01:04:18.280 --> 01:04:20.680
And don't call this New Super Mario Brothers because you

01:04:20.680 --> 01:04:21.880
just part of this shit.

01:04:21.880 --> 01:04:23.240
It's not new.

01:04:23.240 --> 01:04:24.280
It's ported.

01:04:24.280 --> 01:04:25.240
Slightly recycled.

01:04:26.840 --> 01:04:28.200
It doesn't have the same ring to it.

01:04:28.200 --> 01:04:29.960
It's just like, oh, come on.

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:31.800
Well, here's the thing.

01:04:31.800 --> 01:04:32.440
And you know what?

01:04:32.440 --> 01:04:32.840
You're right.

01:04:32.840 --> 01:04:35.640
Because I asked, I'm like, so what's, I even asked the

01:04:35.640 --> 01:04:38.760
well-educated woman that was running the little demo.

01:04:38.760 --> 01:04:41.720
I said, so if I'm just kind of like one guy playing this, you

01:04:41.720 --> 01:04:43.240
know, is there going to be stuff in this for me?

01:04:43.240 --> 01:04:45.720
And she said, well, yeah, there is like a single player mode,

01:04:45.720 --> 01:04:48.280
but it's not really, you know, that's not really the focus.

01:04:48.280 --> 01:04:49.080
Oh, awesome.

01:04:49.080 --> 01:04:50.200
That's not really the focus.

01:04:50.200 --> 01:04:51.560
That's very nice.

01:04:51.560 --> 01:04:51.960
I didn't.

01:04:51.960 --> 01:04:52.360
Here's the thing.

01:04:52.360 --> 01:04:54.360
And I didn't really get, to be fair, that wasn't really the

01:04:54.360 --> 01:04:56.600
focus of the demo they were showing or not really the focus

01:04:56.600 --> 01:04:57.320
of the game.

01:04:57.320 --> 01:04:59.560
My opinion of what she said was that's not really the focus

01:04:59.560 --> 01:05:02.200
of the game because if there was like a single player mode,

01:05:02.200 --> 01:05:04.520
they would have shown it somewhere, but that's not what

01:05:04.520 --> 01:05:05.000
they were showing.

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:07.240
They were showing this four player party thing.

01:05:07.240 --> 01:05:10.200
And strangely enough, it's not online.

01:05:10.840 --> 01:05:12.680
They had the perfect opportunity to have a fun little

01:05:12.680 --> 01:05:13.240
online game.

01:05:13.240 --> 01:05:16.760
Yeah, I love it because as, as Bobby was saying in his show,

01:05:17.320 --> 01:05:20.600
because the processing power of the we can't handle online,

01:05:20.600 --> 01:05:27.400
with this type of game it can't handle online with this type of game what

01:05:27.400 --> 01:05:33.520
didn't brawl do that or whatever what what what the hell was this one they

01:05:33.520 --> 01:05:39.080
just had on the game to be Smash Brothers yes we yeah they had that was

01:05:39.080 --> 01:05:43.600
online it was like you sometimes they did it that this other game have much

01:05:43.600 --> 01:05:50.920
better than brawl yeah it they can't handle online then you need better

01:05:50.920 --> 01:05:57.840
programmers I'm sorry but it's a 2d game okay it's a 2d game with very low polys

01:05:57.840 --> 01:06:04.720
and you can't handle four people online Mario Kart can handle four people online

01:06:04.720 --> 01:06:09.360
and that's my cards fun and that's way more complex than this game why can't

01:06:09.360 --> 01:06:12.280
you handle four people online oh I know why because you don't want to embrace

01:06:12.280 --> 01:06:15.960
online that's really the reason behind it it's not because it's a technical

01:06:15.960 --> 01:06:19.320
limitation because if it was a technical limitation I'm sure you'd find a way

01:06:19.320 --> 01:06:25.040
around it it's a personal limitation it's because uh this the person that's

01:06:25.040 --> 01:06:28.600
gonna buy this game isn't probably really into online they're probably into

01:06:28.600 --> 01:06:34.360
soccer and they probably are a mom that

01:06:34.360 --> 01:06:39.520
half a canana Graham and chat says Rob they said that is the game with extra

01:06:39.520 --> 01:06:43.440
players joining in and leaving at any time so yeah that is the game that's

01:06:43.440 --> 01:06:47.280
exactly what I'm saying don't be fooled this is a party game at least smash

01:06:47.280 --> 01:06:51.840
brothers brawl had a single-player mode that was pretty extensive and fun all I'm

01:06:51.840 --> 01:06:55.440
saying is that if there is you know to be fair to Nintendo if there is a

01:06:55.440 --> 01:06:59.520
single-player fun bonanza in here I just have yet to see it so if you are

01:06:59.520 --> 01:07:03.520
thinking you're excited about this game that's cool I hope you have friends to

01:07:03.520 --> 01:07:07.040
play it with regularly this is when I saw this when they're like oh we have

01:07:07.040 --> 01:07:11.320
new Super Mario Brothers now on the Wii come in this holiday I was like whoop

01:07:11.320 --> 01:07:16.840
these shit there's also people though that I just hope you have friends it's

01:07:16.840 --> 01:07:20.360
like you know oh we've been waiting for a Mario but another Mario Brothers game

01:07:20.360 --> 01:07:27.080
on the Wii new Super Mario Brothers awesome no I'm sorry that wasn't awesome

01:07:27.080 --> 01:07:29.840
Tiger Claw and chat says yeah Nintendo is forgetting that there are many of us

01:07:29.840 --> 01:07:32.640
who don't know people in the neighborhood that own the same system so

01:07:32.640 --> 01:07:36.160
yeah you're pretty much all alone what are you talking about everybody in the

01:07:36.160 --> 01:07:40.640
plant does not own a Wii or I don't know doesn't want to buy this game or it

01:07:40.640 --> 01:07:43.000
doesn't want to come over to your house all right look we got a lot of ground to

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:48.160
cover Mario and Luigi Bowser's Inside Story a new DS Mario and Luigi game I

01:07:48.160 --> 01:07:52.200
I played the first few of the games in this series it is a cute role-playing

01:07:52.200 --> 01:07:59.320
series you know it has its fans okay whatever Super Mario Galaxy 2 okay now

01:07:59.320 --> 01:08:04.720
with Yoshi Mario Galaxy 1 was fun huh Loki where's the love it looked okay but

01:08:04.720 --> 01:08:10.320
honestly looking at Super Mario Galaxy 1 & 2 I couldn't tell you the difference

01:08:10.320 --> 01:08:15.440
and I bet you anything if you comprise of a trailer between 1 & 2 and you you

01:08:15.440 --> 01:08:19.040
know kind of clip them together I bet you no one could tell you what games or

01:08:19.040 --> 01:08:24.320
what levels for were from which games because they look that similar Oh Yoshi's

01:08:24.320 --> 01:08:30.280
in it now oh my mistake Yoshi's in this well obviously it's a sequel now but I

01:08:30.280 --> 01:08:35.680
mean really it they didn't do that much to it I mean whereas you know like Super

01:08:35.680 --> 01:08:40.400
Mario World you know Super Mario World 1 & 2 I mean those are very different

01:08:40.400 --> 01:08:44.360
games yeah they were really different games I mean granted world 2 was kind of

01:08:44.360 --> 01:08:51.400
annoying but um hey world 2 was awesome I was really a baby I mean oh just mute

01:08:51.400 --> 01:08:55.760
the damn TV if it gets to you or don't suck so much and keep losing the baby

01:08:55.760 --> 01:09:01.680
then you won't hear it cry but that's that's that's what Mario Galaxy 2 needs

01:09:01.680 --> 01:09:07.520
a crying baby on the back of Yoshi touch fuzzy get dizzy but that's the thing

01:09:07.520 --> 01:09:10.880
though it's like I mean I understand that they're working on a Mario game but

01:09:10.880 --> 01:09:15.080
it's like they're almost like oh my god fans keep berating us for new Mario game

01:09:15.080 --> 01:09:19.000
what are we gonna do let's just take the old engine to add some new levels to it

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:25.040
you know whereas if the Nintendo Wii had actually been you know designed so that

01:09:25.040 --> 01:09:29.960
you can accept download content we wouldn't have Mario you know galaxy 2 we

01:09:29.960 --> 01:09:34.880
would have download content for Mario Galaxy and there would be your levels

01:09:34.880 --> 01:09:39.760
all right inner logic and chat says okay there's a lot of yelling going on how

01:09:39.760 --> 01:09:43.000
about switching to a subject that can let everyone relax how about we use our

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:49.160
inside maybe 3do talk okay well just for you inner logic let me ask Loki about

01:09:49.160 --> 01:09:52.680
this little gem here one big thing that the Nintendo had to unveil at their

01:09:52.680 --> 01:10:01.000
press conference the Wii vitality sensor I laughed so hard what he's just sitting

01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:05.720
up there talking about the next big innovation it's like oh what are you

01:10:05.720 --> 01:10:08.720
gonna show us what are you gonna show us I know it's gonna be lame but what are

01:10:08.720 --> 01:10:15.600
you gonna show us and then boom the vitality sensor I'm like what the hell

01:10:15.600 --> 01:10:22.200
is this and like everybody I think was like what Thank You Nintendo for giving

01:10:22.200 --> 01:10:25.160
us shit we don't need like they're all it's gonna take the gaming to the next

01:10:25.160 --> 01:10:32.160
level for geriatrics maybe no seriously a heart monitor for we fit it dude I can

01:10:32.160 --> 01:10:35.000
give myself an electrocardiogram on those seriously they're like you know

01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:39.480
it's gonna it's gonna allow you you know that this detects more stuff than just

01:10:39.480 --> 01:10:42.160
the heart rate you know and I'll be relaxed great you'll tell me I'm

01:10:42.160 --> 01:10:46.280
unhealthy in new ways that I didn't think possible that's really gonna help

01:10:46.280 --> 01:10:50.040
me relax what does your we do now let's see brain aid brain age tells you you're

01:10:50.040 --> 01:10:54.320
dumb we fit tells you you're fat I mean now this thing's just gonna tell you

01:10:54.320 --> 01:10:59.600
your heart's bad to our games to screw with the Americans I'm sorry you're all

01:10:59.600 --> 01:11:02.760
they're gonna do is come out with another game that's gonna have some mini

01:11:02.760 --> 01:11:07.440
games based on this accessory and then that's it imagine though Wario where

01:11:07.440 --> 01:11:19.680
with the weave I tell it some of the mini games stop beating I'm sorry it's

01:11:19.680 --> 01:11:23.920
gonna be dumb and no it also makes it dumb is they should have done this like

01:11:23.920 --> 01:11:29.000
Bluetooth or something like that so that you can utilize it with like the we

01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:33.280
nunchuck and stuff like that oh no it just goes in the you know expansion slot

01:11:33.280 --> 01:11:38.080
for the Wii remote so you can't plug in a nunchuck anymore you just have the Wii

01:11:38.080 --> 01:11:42.720
Vitality sensor and I would like to bet you money there's a goddamn Wario where

01:11:42.720 --> 01:11:47.960
game that uses this stupid sensor somehow I bet you any and how long how

01:11:47.960 --> 01:11:52.040
long may I ask before we hear about an injury where someone has inserted their

01:11:52.040 --> 01:11:57.560
penis into the vitality sensor because I bet you anything someone will do that

01:11:57.560 --> 01:12:03.600
because if it's got some sort of way to attach to something someone's gonna

01:12:03.600 --> 01:12:07.960
strike try to stick their penis in there and that's what's gonna happen

01:12:07.960 --> 01:12:11.760
that's immediately when I thought what I saw I'm like how long is it gonna take

01:12:11.760 --> 01:12:17.920
before someone sticks their penis in that I know that's gonna happen I think

01:12:17.920 --> 01:12:23.560
you just made Rob hurt I hurt you know what I didn't even think about this he's

01:12:23.560 --> 01:12:28.640
right guys okay chat room who's gasping and saying WTF and so on he's fucking

01:12:28.640 --> 01:12:33.280
right you know it he's fucking right how long before someone sticks their dick in

01:12:33.280 --> 01:12:37.440
it I mean that's just the question about all of humanity and any object that God

01:12:37.440 --> 01:12:41.880
can put in front of us how long before someone puts their dick in it

01:12:41.880 --> 01:12:49.920
oh grandma me grandma me cello did how long before someone puts their dick in

01:12:49.920 --> 01:12:55.880
it exactly it's mashed potatoes see now all we need is to talk about farting and

01:12:55.880 --> 01:13:00.080
we'll be cool and then and then I'd like to finish off the rest of their their

01:13:00.080 --> 01:13:03.840
wonderful conference they talked about Wii Sports Resort and they added talked

01:13:03.840 --> 01:13:08.560
about the new games there which are fine you know they're they're neat you know

01:13:08.560 --> 01:13:11.760
but you know you have to have the Wii motion plus so guess what if you want

01:13:11.760 --> 01:13:16.800
your friends over you guys spend another $80 to buy four more you know or I guess

01:13:16.800 --> 01:13:21.360
another 60 on top of the game to buy you know three more Wii motion pluses and

01:13:21.360 --> 01:13:26.360
then on top of all that then they have we was it we fit plus which may

01:13:26.360 --> 01:13:30.760
insinuate that it's using Wii motion plus but oh no that would be a wrong

01:13:30.760 --> 01:13:34.840
assumption because really it's just the old game brought back with ten new

01:13:34.840 --> 01:13:40.040
exercises and like some online you know data sharing or something like that

01:13:40.040 --> 01:13:43.720
whoop-dee-doo but guess what they're gonna have new bundles and people are

01:13:43.720 --> 01:13:47.120
gonna be dumb and not realize that it's actually the same game they just bought

01:13:47.120 --> 01:13:53.120
and they're gonna buy it all over again frisbee says now that's what I call

01:13:53.120 --> 01:14:01.560
touch generation games although res with the Wii vitality sensor might be kind of

01:14:01.560 --> 01:14:06.160
fun all right other things out of Nintendo's press conference Wii Sports

01:14:06.160 --> 01:14:09.840
Resort I actually played this game on the floor it was some I played the

01:14:09.840 --> 01:14:15.280
archery game which was you know what can I say about Wii Sports it's the type of

01:14:15.280 --> 01:14:19.400
thing that's fun at a party when I have friends over hey let's play Wii Sports

01:14:19.400 --> 01:14:22.560
let's have a little competition you know because you know we're at a party and

01:14:22.560 --> 01:14:26.800
drinking so we can't go outside and play so let's do some Wii Sports but I don't

01:14:26.800 --> 01:14:29.840
think I would ever play this by myself like hey I'm bored I want to shoot

01:14:29.840 --> 01:14:36.480
archery did you ever figure out what exactly we motion plus does I mean it

01:14:36.480 --> 01:14:41.120
looks like it just allows motion detection in more places I mean to be

01:14:41.120 --> 01:14:44.560
honest the archery thing did feel natural and I think with the controller

01:14:44.560 --> 01:14:48.440
they have today it would have been a little bit because we remember it's

01:14:48.440 --> 01:14:56.520
shaking way back we did play archery in deca support yeah how I don't know if

01:14:56.520 --> 01:15:00.600
you remember that that much not really but I do I seem to recall there was more

01:15:00.600 --> 01:15:04.240
I don't know it just seemed more precision I don't know I don't know how

01:15:04.240 --> 01:15:08.400
to explain it I don't know don't get me wrong I don't think this Wii motion plus

01:15:08.400 --> 01:15:12.720
is anything that special I didn't but keep in mind this is the only thing I

01:15:12.720 --> 01:15:17.040
got to see I stood in a fairly long line just to play this and then I got kicked

01:15:17.040 --> 01:15:20.920
out for some filming of something thank you very much Nintendo at least I got a

01:15:20.920 --> 01:15:25.600
frisbee you know but whatever and it's that's part of the give-and-take of e3

01:15:25.600 --> 01:15:28.640
you know so I can't base my entire judgment of this game off of what I

01:15:28.640 --> 01:15:34.800
played however you know again I didn't see anything that made me go oh you know

01:15:34.800 --> 01:15:40.720
I need this game Red Seal 2 though looked awesome with how so I didn't

01:15:40.720 --> 01:15:44.960
really check that out it ran really smooth 60 frames per second the Wii

01:15:44.960 --> 01:15:50.720
motion plus and sword tracking really worked and it looked fun unlike Red Seal

01:15:50.720 --> 01:15:57.800
1 which sucked other games shown in Nintendo's press conference Wii Fit Plus

01:15:57.800 --> 01:16:01.120
which I also actually played on the show floor and you know you know I've

01:16:01.120 --> 01:16:03.840
actually been somewhat of an advocate of Wii Fit despite all the crap we give

01:16:03.840 --> 01:16:09.720
Nintendo I do think Wii Fit is a good thing Wii Fit Plus more for people who

01:16:09.720 --> 01:16:13.120
don't already own it I can't see my I mean it really depends on the price

01:16:13.120 --> 01:16:15.960
point I didn't see how much they were gonna charge for this game I can't see

01:16:15.960 --> 01:16:20.880
myself paying a lot of money for it if it's not going to give me anything that

01:16:20.880 --> 01:16:24.440
special if that makes sense what if it is more mini games what if they make we

01:16:24.440 --> 01:16:30.080
lipo I'd probably buy it are we gastric bypass I could use that no I don't I

01:16:30.080 --> 01:16:33.320
wouldn't want that too many risks with that but the game the game I played on

01:16:33.320 --> 01:16:36.680
the floor was a bicycling game where you use the Wii mode it's like the

01:16:36.680 --> 01:16:42.040
handlebars on a bike and you kind of March in place to pedal your bike it was

01:16:42.040 --> 01:16:45.640
it was a good workout and it was it was a cute mini game so that I mean there

01:16:45.640 --> 01:16:48.720
was like a marching band mini game it looks like some of their new mini games

01:16:48.720 --> 01:16:53.280
are pretty inventive but is it going to be worth 40 bucks for just these few new

01:16:53.280 --> 01:16:57.520
mini games I don't know depends how much how good that online functionality is

01:16:57.520 --> 01:17:04.000
but based on what I saw I don't really see anything that justifies 40 bucks 20

01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:07.280
bucks maybe but I highly doubt that's what they're charging for it it's not

01:17:07.280 --> 01:17:13.680
going to be 20 bucks exactly so um let's see what other kind of stuff was

01:17:13.680 --> 01:17:16.880
announced in a press conference that's pretty much all that I have on my list I

01:17:16.880 --> 01:17:20.960
don't know if there was others of your eyes announced hmm that didn't quite

01:17:20.960 --> 01:17:27.400
make their press conference new colors that's right it was about time now Japan

01:17:27.400 --> 01:17:32.360
during the summer we'll be getting a black we that's right black wheeze

01:17:32.360 --> 01:17:37.960
coming on August 1st and we'll be coming with you know colored accessories as

01:17:37.960 --> 01:17:43.400
well including the black we mote classic controller and classic controller Pro

01:17:43.400 --> 01:17:46.680
which they actually did have that in a little like case over there kept walking

01:17:46.680 --> 01:17:52.400
by and go what the hell is that but don't really care and also we'll be

01:17:52.400 --> 01:17:58.160
getting a D red DSI system as well launching July 11th I wouldn't be

01:17:58.160 --> 01:18:00.840
surprised if we see this around Christmas cuz that would be about the

01:18:00.840 --> 01:18:06.840
time to put out something I want to buy the system but it wasn't black oh now I

01:18:06.840 --> 01:18:12.920
get to buy it you know really I don't think so but okay then they also had

01:18:12.920 --> 01:18:19.220
some other games that they were showing off that I didn't really I really know

01:18:19.220 --> 01:18:24.720
what they were but they owe other announcements obviously DSI was getting

01:18:24.720 --> 01:18:31.160
a Facebook support as well they're gonna allow you to upload pictures you take

01:18:31.160 --> 01:18:35.040
with the DSI camera with face to Facebook as if there wasn't enough crap

01:18:35.040 --> 01:18:39.360
on my feed I hope I can block it like you can all the other stuff actually I

01:18:39.360 --> 01:18:42.760
don't know what the DSI depending on who it is it might be kind of funny well

01:18:42.760 --> 01:18:45.900
that's cool and all but I guess okay because I guess like it's not like

01:18:45.900 --> 01:18:49.040
screenshots from DS games it's the actual camera in your DSI right yes

01:18:49.040 --> 01:18:53.480
that's no different from mobile uploads so whatever that's cool I guess that's

01:18:53.480 --> 01:18:57.320
neat and all but what I wish they'd have something for the Wii like you know some

01:18:57.320 --> 01:19:01.520
of this functionality for the Wii but I guess you know they've given up on that

01:19:01.520 --> 01:19:05.840
and then of course announcing that they you're gonna localize some of the other

01:19:05.840 --> 01:19:10.760
stuff that released in Japan already including Warioware DIY you know which

01:19:10.760 --> 01:19:15.720
is the Warioware you know kind of create your own minigames type thing they've

01:19:15.720 --> 01:19:21.000
also announced Flipnote Studios for DSI this summer which is also you know like

01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:26.480
the motion notepad that they have in Japan right now and new Mario and Luigi

01:19:26.480 --> 01:19:31.560
RP well was it March of the minis again they're gonna do another Mario vs.

01:19:31.560 --> 01:19:35.080
Donkey Kong game I think that was gonna be a DSI only app or something like that

01:19:35.080 --> 01:19:38.480
oh that was the one that came out and it's out tomorrow or something like

01:19:38.480 --> 01:19:43.280
didn't they announce that something like it's out now it was a download game I

01:19:43.280 --> 01:19:46.000
don't have a DSI can I say this though real quick is the chat room really wants

01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:49.120
us to mention Golden Sun I've saw a couple other people mentioning that

01:19:49.120 --> 01:19:53.160
before an SSJ 100 Matt kind of sums it up here I got excited for a split second

01:19:53.160 --> 01:19:56.240
when they said at their press conference an old franchise that was once gone is

01:19:56.240 --> 01:20:01.520
coming back I thought maybe mother three kid Icarus yeah I know but I saw that

01:20:01.520 --> 01:20:05.200
too I that was funny like oh yeah they're gonna announce mother three oh

01:20:05.200 --> 01:20:11.960
nope they're not all right anything else you want to say about Nintendo's press

01:20:11.960 --> 01:20:20.000
conference it still sucked now the Rob D wants to point out I'm really excited I

01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:23.320
loved Golden Sun this is a good thing a very good thing yeah I mean the Golden

01:20:23.320 --> 01:20:27.240
Sun games are fun but you have to admit there's some folks that are gonna feel

01:20:27.240 --> 01:20:30.320
that huge sense of disappointment like oh my god I've been waiting forever for

01:20:30.320 --> 01:20:36.280
kid Icarus here it is Oh Golden Sun fuck you you know there are there were a lot

01:20:36.280 --> 01:20:40.480
of people that had that moment but I'm glad at least some people got a thrill

01:20:40.480 --> 01:20:43.240
out of the whole golden this announcement yeah I mean in the end it's

01:20:43.240 --> 01:20:46.880
not like it's a bad announcement it just I think they set the bar a little high

01:20:46.880 --> 01:20:53.360
with that announcement anyhow let's see I think what I think we're gonna go

01:20:53.360 --> 01:20:56.000
ahead and take a break we're almost about an hour and a half into the show

01:20:56.000 --> 01:21:00.360
but before we get to the break of course we always like to close out part a with

01:21:00.360 --> 01:21:05.080
a moment where we can kind of respect the classics so that's exactly what

01:21:05.080 --> 01:21:08.120
we're gonna do tonight we're gonna do a little segment we always do here called

01:21:08.120 --> 01:21:14.840
the classic game of the week so dark soccer amongst all these newfangled

01:21:14.840 --> 01:21:18.680
games we're talking about is the three what's an old classic that folks should

01:21:18.680 --> 01:21:23.880
be revisiting I went for old and obscure it's actually a game I've mentioned on

01:21:23.880 --> 01:21:29.840
the show before which is to date one of my favorite shoot-em-up games is called

01:21:29.840 --> 01:21:39.880
Genga Fukete Densetsu Sapphire which is on the duo oops I cut it off

01:21:39.880 --> 01:21:44.400
accidentally sorry here we go again here's a little clip of the game

01:21:48.760 --> 01:21:56.000
our arcade CD-ROM games that came out so that means of course with my turbo duo I

01:21:56.000 --> 01:22:03.800
can't play it which I do own a copy of the game but it's also one of the few

01:22:03.800 --> 01:22:09.560
games towards the end of the PC engines life that had an actual real 3d in it in

01:22:09.560 --> 01:22:15.640
the form of the bosses and some of the enemies in the game but it actually came

01:22:15.640 --> 01:22:19.160
out recently on PSP as part of the galaxy Fraulein collection which is

01:22:19.160 --> 01:22:23.360
actually something I plan on ordering very soon because again this is one of

01:22:23.360 --> 01:22:29.160
my favorite games and if you want to find it on eBay good luck it's gonna

01:22:29.160 --> 01:22:34.320
this game will out will actually ends up costing more than Dracula X does is one

01:22:34.320 --> 01:22:40.680
will go for easily 400 bucks I've seen it but anyway it's basically just a

01:22:40.680 --> 01:22:44.520
standard you know shoot them up you can get your upgrade your weapons and you

01:22:44.520 --> 01:22:47.960
have your little option things hanging out with you and you just basically go

01:22:47.960 --> 01:22:52.000
to the game and shoot stuff now I type the name of the game in chat but they

01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:54.440
would like to hear it pronounced once again because it is not an easy name

01:22:54.440 --> 01:22:58.960
because it is a Japanese game oh it's ginga fukay

01:22:58.960 --> 01:23:06.040
Densetsu sapphire there you go if you want a translation of the name that is

01:23:06.040 --> 01:23:11.800
galaxy police woman legend sapphire it came out in 1995 it is a Hudson soft

01:23:11.800 --> 01:23:19.080
game one of the oh god I love Hudson but but also one of the things about the

01:23:19.080 --> 01:23:22.160
game this is actually something that I've actually seen in several reviews

01:23:22.160 --> 01:23:29.120
I'm gonna repeat this one from one little review this says that really the

01:23:29.120 --> 01:23:34.760
game is more of overcoming the game's mechanics rather than mastering them so

01:23:34.760 --> 01:23:39.400
really a lot of playing in the game is hit or miss whether or not you make it

01:23:39.400 --> 01:23:44.840
through it the game has it out for you it's gonna have that where you have

01:23:44.840 --> 01:23:50.440
actual oh that's kind of neat like this boss looks like imagine one of those

01:23:50.440 --> 01:23:54.440
giant chemistry molecules they have hanging from cotton chemistry class like

01:23:54.440 --> 01:23:57.000
it's like one of those things but it's actually like rotating around and

01:23:57.000 --> 01:24:01.360
spinning around so for you know a game from 95 that's a pretty cool depth yeah

01:24:01.360 --> 01:24:09.720
it was it really is though even though it's really a little bit on the the hard

01:24:09.720 --> 01:24:14.240
side your bosses are so easy in this one because they are so predictable in their

01:24:14.240 --> 01:24:21.680
patterns and the whole the whole part though is you know trying to get around

01:24:21.680 --> 01:24:28.680
how slow your ship really is because the ship is you'll see the ship does move

01:24:28.680 --> 01:24:36.680
really slowly and you have a relatively large hitbox you know the area that will

01:24:36.680 --> 01:24:43.160
count as you being hit so but other than that game really doesn't look easy it

01:24:43.160 --> 01:24:46.160
does look very hard have you actually had a chance to play this star soccer

01:24:46.160 --> 01:24:52.640
yeah my friend actually she lives in Japan right now she has an original of

01:24:52.640 --> 01:25:01.000
this which is how I got my copy of it but she well she's got a PC engine duo

01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:05.720
and arcade card so we went over to her house and just she said okay play this

01:25:05.720 --> 01:25:10.340
game okay play this game okay play this game and sapphire was just like oh my

01:25:10.340 --> 01:25:15.680
god it was like this one and another shooter a psychic storm were the ones

01:25:15.680 --> 01:25:18.260
that I played the most but mostly because in psychic storm it sounds like

01:25:18.260 --> 01:25:21.360
they're saying I get pissed off instead of saying psychic storm but that's

01:25:21.360 --> 01:25:26.900
another game but see isn't that we really should post the link to this in

01:25:26.900 --> 01:25:31.360
the chat room because it's something that you really have to see it's just a

01:25:31.360 --> 01:25:37.880
fantastic a fantastic shooter and you know I'm gonna actually do it in eBay

01:25:37.880 --> 01:25:42.080
search right now and see if I can find out how much going for all right well

01:25:42.080 --> 01:25:44.680
let me just go ahead and wrap this up and say it's there it is again your

01:25:44.680 --> 01:25:47.560
classic game of the week and Jamie might have to correct me here

01:25:47.560 --> 01:25:54.240
ginga fuke Densetsu sapphire not bad all right there it is your classic game of

01:26:06.680 --> 01:26:09.920

and welcome back everybody to orange lounge radio on our 326th episode for

01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:45.160
this June the 7th of 2009 as a reminder we do tape live on Sunday nights over at

01:26:45.160 --> 01:26:48.960
all games calm right after the Bobby Black Wolf show which is about six

01:26:48.960 --> 01:26:52.440
o'clock Pacific Standard Time nine o'clock Eastern Standard Time unless

01:26:52.440 --> 01:26:55.920
it's a special night maybe Bobby will go a little longer we'll start more like

01:26:55.920 --> 01:27:00.280
615 as tonight was because it was Bobby's 200th episode quite an

01:27:00.280 --> 01:27:05.240
accomplishment so congratulations to Bobby remember when we were only 200 I

01:27:05.240 --> 01:27:10.000
remember those days but no no I'm to be fair Bobby is very consistent he does a

01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:13.240
show I mean he only is missed like maybe two or three shows about it throughout

01:27:13.240 --> 01:27:18.640
his entire run whereas we miss one every few months we try not to but as

01:27:18.640 --> 01:27:21.960
sometimes you know things happen but Bobby's a very committed individual so

01:27:21.960 --> 01:27:25.160
props to him it's a very neat accomplishment all right anyhow we're

01:27:25.160 --> 01:27:30.000
gonna get back and do some e3 rundown again unscripted tonight just kind of

01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:35.120
talking and playing around talking about some of the various events that have

01:27:35.120 --> 01:27:39.400
happened at e3 and I guess we're going to talk about Sony's press conference if

01:27:39.400 --> 01:27:43.320
that's all right before we do that I was gonna mention a few more things about

01:27:43.320 --> 01:27:48.160
Nintendo the stuff I saw I got to see sin and punishment 2 which looked

01:27:48.160 --> 01:27:53.640
awesome you know give me a great game for shooter fans also they had a few

01:27:53.640 --> 01:27:58.840
other games are shown off didn't really announce which looked interesting I'm

01:27:58.840 --> 01:28:03.240
not sure what they really think of them like they had for example line attack

01:28:03.240 --> 01:28:07.120
heroes which looked like you have like almost like a marching band worth you

01:28:07.120 --> 01:28:10.840
know like people just following you and you all had different abilities and you

01:28:10.840 --> 01:28:16.000
kind of attack in formation which is weird and then this other game like we

01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:21.000
game called span smashers which I don't even know what that looked like it was

01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:24.440
kind of weird but they had like some other stuff that they were announcing

01:28:24.440 --> 01:28:28.800
fossil fighters for the DS which actually I know that's coming out in

01:28:28.800 --> 01:28:35.200
August and some other you knew a new professor Leighton game and Pokemon

01:28:35.200 --> 01:28:41.080
mystery dungeon explorers of the sky all sorts of stuff so that was kind of neat

01:28:41.080 --> 01:28:48.800
and then I think I said in punishment 2 is supposed to be coming out quarter 1

01:28:48.800 --> 01:28:53.440
of next year so that's kind of cool all right are we okay to move on Sony now

01:28:53.440 --> 01:28:57.680
sure let's talk Sony Sony definitely had a lot of big news out of their press

01:28:57.680 --> 01:29:02.800
conference and very interesting story I have about Sony Loki you missed day one

01:29:02.800 --> 01:29:05.600
of e3 which is when the Sony press conference is going on from what I

01:29:05.600 --> 01:29:09.160
understand day one of e3 was not originally supposed to start until noon

01:29:09.160 --> 01:29:12.720
but it ended up starting at 10 a.m. but the interesting effect this had is it

01:29:12.720 --> 01:29:16.760
caused Sony's press conference to run into the beginning of the show I was not

01:29:16.760 --> 01:29:19.360
well I was invited to Sony's press conference so I was not able to get

01:29:19.360 --> 01:29:23.480
there or make my plans in time to get there so I was just like oh well you

01:29:23.480 --> 01:29:27.680
know I'm sure I'll see everything you know later on which I was of course but

01:29:27.680 --> 01:29:31.640
one cool thing is that at Sony's booth they were playing the press conference

01:29:31.640 --> 01:29:36.520
so it was it was one of the few places that I'm sorry one of the first places I

01:29:36.520 --> 01:29:39.720
went to when I was at e3 was I went to Sony's booth and Nintendo's booth were

01:29:39.720 --> 01:29:44.360
kind of right next to each other and I wanted to check that out but obviously

01:29:44.360 --> 01:29:47.120
there's some big announcements as Sony what's also cool a lot of people may not

01:29:47.120 --> 01:29:50.640
know because they were at Sony's press conference God of War 3 as you know was

01:29:50.640 --> 01:29:54.720
playable at the show floor in Sony's booth but during the press conference

01:29:54.720 --> 01:29:58.680
all the monitors were turned off so you actually couldn't play God of War 3

01:29:58.680 --> 01:30:02.160
until the walkthrough was done but you knew it was going to be there because

01:30:02.160 --> 01:30:06.480
they had the God of War 3 sign up and they already had a line forming but just

01:30:06.480 --> 01:30:09.800
nobody could play it until the press conference is actually over but I did

01:30:09.800 --> 01:30:12.120
get to see some of Sony's press conference at the booth which is kind of

01:30:12.120 --> 01:30:15.240
cool and to see some of their big announcements of course God of War 3

01:30:15.240 --> 01:30:19.280
being one of them I'm not huge on the God of War series you know I certainly

01:30:19.280 --> 01:30:23.280
respect what it is it's just I don't have time to play everything as none of

01:30:23.280 --> 01:30:27.080
us do and this is just one of the big series I haven't gotten around to Loki I

01:30:27.080 --> 01:30:30.460
don't know if you're big on these games I like them they're okay it's nothing

01:30:30.460 --> 01:30:33.680
really innovative for God of War 3 other than you know obviously the nicer

01:30:33.680 --> 01:30:37.880
graphics now with the PlayStation 3 and it is a little bit more detailed in the

01:30:37.880 --> 01:30:43.400
gore in fact there is one point where they had slashed open I believe a

01:30:43.400 --> 01:30:47.680
minotaur and just like his organs are spilling out and you got to see those

01:30:47.680 --> 01:30:53.320
organs still out so that was kind of cool yeah so I mean yeah it's gonna if

01:30:53.320 --> 01:30:57.040
you're a fan of God of War you're gonna love this game I mean it's just the same

01:30:57.040 --> 01:31:01.800
type of gameplay that you can normally expect from them brand new trailer for

01:31:01.800 --> 01:31:05.880
Final Fantasy 13 shown with English voice acting in the trailers that's nice

01:31:05.880 --> 01:31:09.060
to know what's actually going on for once yeah it's nice to kind of understand

01:31:09.060 --> 01:31:13.320
it and it looks looks very nice the voices look very synced up with the lips

01:31:13.320 --> 01:31:18.360
I don't think that they have redone the voice there yeah you know how usually in

01:31:18.360 --> 01:31:23.120
the dubbing it's very obvious it's dubbed but they they look in sync this

01:31:23.120 --> 01:31:28.320
time which is kind of nice I don't know we'll see for now they do we'll see so

01:31:28.320 --> 01:31:32.400
cuz you know how usually they dub over the Japanese lips do you remember when

01:31:32.400 --> 01:31:37.760
10-2 came out they re-synced the animation to the voices to it'll be nice

01:31:37.760 --> 01:31:41.760
that they do that for 13 but I'm not counting on it and they redid the a lot

01:31:41.760 --> 01:31:47.880
of the CG to to match voice and they completely redid two whole scenes in

01:31:47.880 --> 01:31:53.160
that game for the American audience yeah so it makes sense they do something like

01:31:53.160 --> 01:31:57.280
that with 13 so obviously this games on its way out and they did confirm this

01:31:57.280 --> 01:32:01.200
for 2010 release and it was nice to see some of it actually getting pulled you

01:32:01.200 --> 01:32:04.160
know some more of its shown to get know a little more showed Odin which is

01:32:04.160 --> 01:32:08.880
pretty cool yes and some of the summons which is pretty awesome but then a huge

01:32:08.880 --> 01:32:13.320
bombshell dropped right after that at the show and what's interesting about it

01:32:13.320 --> 01:32:16.780
is that then he started talking about how Final Fantasy 14 was exclusive to

01:32:16.780 --> 01:32:19.840
the PlayStation 3 before even showing the trailer talked about I'm here to

01:32:19.840 --> 01:32:23.120
announce a Final Fantasy 14 is going to be exclusive on the PlayStation 3 and

01:32:23.120 --> 01:32:27.940
everybody's thinking oh oh you meant versus oh you meant 13 versus oh you

01:32:27.940 --> 01:32:32.200
silly man oh you know like everybody thought he messed up and then they show

01:32:32.200 --> 01:32:36.560
the trailer and sure enough oh my god it is Final Fantasy 14 and not just that

01:32:36.560 --> 01:32:43.040
it's Final Fantasy 14 online you mean 11 2 yeah so for some people it's 11 2 and

01:32:43.040 --> 01:32:47.360
you might even think oh my gosh I saw elves in the trailer gaulka Taru it is

01:32:47.360 --> 01:32:50.640
just 11 2 especially you can kind of tell which parts are probably from the

01:32:50.640 --> 01:32:55.520
game but if you read a little deeper it's a different world and supposedly

01:32:55.520 --> 01:33:00.200
the races are similar but different they're actually one up of all places

01:33:00.200 --> 01:33:04.240
actually had a pretty in-depth talk on Final Fantasy 14 and some of the things

01:33:04.240 --> 01:33:07.360
they've talked about they have learned a lot of their lessons from the prior game

01:33:07.360 --> 01:33:11.480
this game is going to be launched globally Final Fantasy 14 it's gonna be

01:33:11.480 --> 01:33:15.240
on the PlayStation 3 and the PC it's gonna be on both they're also talking

01:33:15.240 --> 01:33:19.620
about bringing it to the 360 they're thinking about it I suppose but nothing's

01:33:19.620 --> 01:33:24.840
for sure yet and what yeah I'll probably playing it on the PC no matter what I

01:33:24.840 --> 01:33:28.680
can't imagine playing it on a console I don't know I really wish they hadn't

01:33:28.680 --> 01:33:34.680
announced this well because he's watching like sucked away oh no I I

01:33:34.680 --> 01:33:39.120
seriously wanted to cry standing in the booth watching that trailer and it

01:33:39.120 --> 01:33:42.600
wasn't because of the trailer itself but it's because I just saw the next few

01:33:42.600 --> 01:33:46.120
years of my life wilting away at this game because we all know that's what's

01:33:46.120 --> 01:33:50.560
gonna happen no no no no no no this will happen to me because I have something

01:33:50.560 --> 01:33:55.800
far better to look forward to Star Trek online right yeah I know that's gonna be

01:33:55.800 --> 01:33:59.000
tough because I want to play that too but it won't be tough at all for me I

01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:03.160
do want to talk about 14 online a little more because some other things they said

01:34:03.160 --> 01:34:06.840
in the interview they are designing this game so whether you have hours to play

01:34:06.840 --> 01:34:11.560
or 40 minutes to play you will be able to play and that they are gearing or

01:34:11.560 --> 01:34:20.200
they are tailoring this game to solo and party content yeah thanks God so it's

01:34:20.200 --> 01:34:23.520
like it sounds like like some of the biggest flaws of Final Fantasy 11 have

01:34:23.520 --> 01:34:27.560
the potential of being addressed in this this this could be huge but of course I

01:34:27.560 --> 01:34:32.040
don't want to set the bar too high or I might be disappointed so I'm and of

01:34:32.040 --> 01:34:36.760
course the chat room wants to know I mean whoa maybe this is good music for

01:34:36.760 --> 01:34:41.360
that question no I may set sumo wants to know in chat a sky Final Fantasy 14 or

01:34:41.360 --> 01:34:47.280
Star Trek what a tough question I have to play them both it's too early to say

01:34:47.280 --> 01:34:52.320
because you know they both might say the question well it is because they I'm

01:34:52.320 --> 01:34:56.640
gonna try them both how's that both I want to play them both but I will keep

01:34:56.640 --> 01:35:02.400
the one that's more fun in the end which probably is gonna be 14 but I don't know

01:35:02.400 --> 01:35:06.080
nothing's for sure yet nothing's for sure yet because I do explode other

01:35:06.080 --> 01:35:10.800
ships I do I yeah they honestly lay a Ferengi there how could how could these

01:35:10.800 --> 01:35:16.600
games be any more different one is about freaking space and one is about swords

01:35:16.600 --> 01:35:20.560
and weapons they didn't have a ship so they're flying around in each other and

01:35:20.560 --> 01:35:23.360
something so you're gonna get sucked into this MMO Loki after I don't know

01:35:23.360 --> 01:35:26.960
here's the best I don't have time if the wife's not gonna let you you have kids

01:35:26.960 --> 01:35:34.640
to raise now who cares you can get a sitter I'll play I'll let them play to

01:35:34.640 --> 01:35:38.440
SSJ 100 man chat says why can't we have our cake and pie at the same time

01:35:38.440 --> 01:35:42.720
exactly haven't you ever heard of getting ice cream and honestly honestly

01:35:42.720 --> 01:35:45.560
afraid of having these I I don't know if I'll actually play this game because I

01:35:45.560 --> 01:35:50.640
just want time it's it'll be a time factor but I am very excited about this

01:35:50.640 --> 01:35:55.200
and honestly I would say that this right here was the biggest surprise of the

01:35:55.200 --> 01:35:59.140
show no one saw this coming who could imagine that they would have Final

01:35:59.140 --> 01:36:04.040
Fantasy 14 coming out the same year as 13 hypothetically I don't think they're

01:36:04.040 --> 01:36:07.840
actually gonna make it I bet you anything 14 gets pushed back to 2011 but

01:36:07.840 --> 01:36:11.080
just the fact that they kind of had the balls to do it announce the next Final

01:36:11.080 --> 01:36:19.120
Fantasy game before one's even done is kind of interesting so we'll see other

01:36:19.120 --> 01:36:22.680
big things announced at Sony's press conference how about ModNation racers

01:36:22.680 --> 01:36:26.400
that was sweet looking that was a neat looking game Loki would tell us a little

01:36:26.400 --> 01:36:31.360
bit about this game ModNation racers is gonna be the next of that play create

01:36:31.360 --> 01:36:36.200
share type of game you know basically like LittleBigPlanet but with a Mario

01:36:36.200 --> 01:36:41.040
Kart racing game so you've got these you know characters that you create that

01:36:41.040 --> 01:36:45.240
kind of look like those money characters you know basically design the way your

01:36:45.240 --> 01:36:48.960
character looks and you give them clothing and stuff like that and then

01:36:48.960 --> 01:36:52.480
the tracks themselves I mean you could play the tracks that are in the game or

01:36:52.480 --> 01:36:56.960
you can use this tool that basically is as easy as driving a cart around wherever

01:36:56.960 --> 01:37:00.960
you want to go and then plopping the landscape down to go along with it and

01:37:00.960 --> 01:37:04.200
power ups and that kind of stuff so people are gonna be able to make their

01:37:04.200 --> 01:37:07.960
own levels you know obviously the marker ripoff levels are gonna be in here as

01:37:07.960 --> 01:37:13.080
well but basically create whatever they want as far as new races have goes and

01:37:13.080 --> 01:37:19.400
then share it with their friends and it's gonna be cool I can't wait to see

01:37:19.400 --> 01:37:24.200
how levels get moderated in this game for being Mario Kart courses will be

01:37:24.200 --> 01:37:30.920
interesting yeah it will be interesting it looks fun though I definitely game I

01:37:30.920 --> 01:37:37.440
want to pick up a great exclusive franchise for Sony for them I love this

01:37:37.440 --> 01:37:40.440
back-and-forth going on in chat room about the whole Star Trek online our

01:37:40.440 --> 01:37:43.000
chat rooms usually about 30 seconds behind the show so sometimes we're a

01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:48.160
little late reading their comments Rama in chat says space the final frontier

01:37:48.160 --> 01:37:53.520
these are the voyagers of the starship olr prize Antarctica continues its

01:37:53.520 --> 01:37:59.360
ongoing mission to seek out new life and new civilizations and blow shit up Rama

01:37:59.360 --> 01:38:04.960
finishes to boldly go where no geek has gone before very nice very nicely done

01:38:04.960 --> 01:38:11.640
I like the blow shit up part best let's see uncharted 2 among thieves I know

01:38:11.640 --> 01:38:16.160
there's a lot of folks very excited about this game I'm not one of them but

01:38:16.160 --> 01:38:21.240
it looked neat um what I don't know you know what I'm sitting here and I'm

01:38:21.240 --> 01:38:29.160
holding in my hand a multiplayer beta code for uncharted 2 and you know I I

01:38:29.160 --> 01:38:33.000
don't really want to use it I don't think Loki wants to use it either dark

01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:36.640
soccer probably not gonna really play it so I'm thinking we should give this

01:38:36.640 --> 01:38:40.440
uncharted 2 among thieves code to a listener what do you think let's do it

01:38:40.440 --> 01:38:44.240
all right here's the thing though is that this listener has to be willing to

01:38:44.240 --> 01:38:49.760
write something for the website on this so if we give away this beta code we

01:38:49.760 --> 01:38:53.240
want them to write something for the website with their impressions so that's

01:38:53.240 --> 01:38:57.520
the deal we give you the code you give us an article so um how do we give it

01:38:57.520 --> 01:39:00.120
away do we give it away to live we should let the podcasters have a chance

01:39:00.120 --> 01:39:03.280
at it too right or maybe maybe open it up on Twitter or something I think it

01:39:03.280 --> 01:39:07.200
should be a match game prize maybe a match game prize later on no I think

01:39:07.200 --> 01:39:10.560
something a little bit more fair just like yeah I'm actually only two people

01:39:10.560 --> 01:39:20.000
so let's see maybe um let's see send us an email no I got it send us a tweet

01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:24.360
because you're restricted to a hundred and forty characters send us a tweet as

01:39:24.360 --> 01:39:30.240
to why you should get this code okay and then we'll pick the ones we like and

01:39:30.240 --> 01:39:33.400
pick one at random we don't want to pick our favorite because that's a little too

01:39:33.400 --> 01:39:36.900
objective we'll take all the ones we like and pull one out at random so if

01:39:36.900 --> 01:39:41.160
you send us a tweet about better be awesome and not direct message do not do

01:39:41.160 --> 01:39:45.520
a direct message you got to do at olr and then whatever the message is so and

01:39:45.520 --> 01:39:50.920
maybe by next show we'll figure out is that too late valid June 3rd through

01:39:50.920 --> 01:39:55.680
June 28th we probably need to give this away sooner rather than later yeah how

01:39:55.680 --> 01:40:01.160
about tomorrow yeah mostly post the reply on Twitter the podcast won't be up

01:40:01.160 --> 01:40:03.160
at tomorrow but maybe I'll post something on the Twitter about the

01:40:03.160 --> 01:40:08.920
contest tomorrow Friday Thursday maybe let's say midweek Wednesday Wednesday

01:40:08.920 --> 01:40:12.280
is when the show should go up so we're gonna say by Wednesday if you send us a

01:40:12.280 --> 01:40:16.040
tweet about why you should get this uncharted to beta code we're gonna take

01:40:16.040 --> 01:40:18.360
our favorites a randomly pick one and give it to you and then you're gonna

01:40:18.360 --> 01:40:24.120
write something for our website there you go a 140 character essay I like that

01:40:24.120 --> 01:40:28.200
so to our favorite tweet at why you should have the uncharted to code and

01:40:28.200 --> 01:40:32.880
we'll post a reminder on Twitter a little later on exciting all right um

01:40:32.880 --> 01:40:37.200
let's see other games that were shown at Sony's press conference the last Guardian

01:40:37.200 --> 01:40:42.440
ooh pretty trailer wasn't that a pretty trailer the new Ico project shadow the

01:40:42.440 --> 01:40:46.920
Colossus those people it's cool just like you know magical like the other

01:40:46.920 --> 01:40:50.080
games yeah look kind of pretty but I'm looking forward to seeing more about a

01:40:50.080 --> 01:40:54.920
Gran Turismo PSP it you know for PSP game it actually look pretty good

01:40:54.920 --> 01:41:00.640
running at 60 frames per second looks very smooth about fucking time that it

01:41:00.640 --> 01:41:05.080
came out though seen as it was supposed to be a launch title so they sure take

01:41:05.080 --> 01:41:10.800
their times on those Gran Turismo games Metal Gear Solid on the PSP as I

01:41:10.800 --> 01:41:16.360
predicted a game based off of the Metal Gear Solid 3 universe there were you

01:41:16.360 --> 01:41:19.600
playing as big boss what's kind of interesting though is they're going to

01:41:19.600 --> 01:41:25.280
have like online co-op or like ad hoc co-op or something like that where you

01:41:25.280 --> 01:41:30.400
can actually play as each person is like a big boss character which kind of is

01:41:30.400 --> 01:41:38.000
funny look like clones how about Assassin's Creed 2 you know it's a neat

01:41:38.000 --> 01:41:41.120
trailer but I just don't really care about that game unfortunately I played

01:41:41.120 --> 01:41:44.360
the first one didn't like it kind of file it in the whole don't have time to

01:41:44.360 --> 01:41:48.640
play everything it's sort of yeah it's a neat game they are doing a little bit

01:41:48.640 --> 01:41:53.800
more with it I think as far as the depth of the game but I mean if you like the

01:41:53.800 --> 01:41:57.720
first one you're obviously gonna like this obviously we've been talking a lot

01:41:57.720 --> 01:42:03.480
about the PSP but how can we not mention something about the PSP go $249 for the

01:42:03.480 --> 01:42:07.240
PSP go are people gonna pay it or did they shoot themselves in the foot that's

01:42:07.240 --> 01:42:11.780
a tough sell for a system that doesn't have UMD drive on it and I don't give a

01:42:11.780 --> 01:42:17.200
crap if it has 16 megs or 16 gigabytes of storage you know what I can buy a 16

01:42:17.200 --> 01:42:23.840
gigabyte card for cheaper than the difference so and and there's a lot of

01:42:23.840 --> 01:42:30.840
stuff that we don't know that's like kind of as far as specs goes it's a

01:42:30.840 --> 01:42:36.320
processor better yeah we don't know if it's the same I mean is it got more RAM

01:42:36.320 --> 01:42:41.760
in it what exactly separates us it obviously now it can't really utilize

01:42:41.760 --> 01:42:45.480
some of the peripherals I think because of where they've placed different things

01:42:45.480 --> 01:42:56.640
on it it's a neat idea I guess but I don't know it seems like kind of a waste

01:42:56.640 --> 01:43:00.520
because they're not really doing anything with this well here's what's

01:43:00.520 --> 01:43:04.400
interesting is that also one of the big things I said I'm am I gonna be able to

01:43:04.400 --> 01:43:09.320
play my old UMDs on it and the answer is possibly we haven't heard the final

01:43:09.320 --> 01:43:14.000
answer yet but apparently Sony isn't developing right now a goodwill program

01:43:14.000 --> 01:43:17.620
is what they're calling it and basically they're saying it might be similar to

01:43:17.620 --> 01:43:21.660
portable copy which is how you transfer your blu-ray movies from the ps3 down

01:43:21.660 --> 01:43:28.060
to the PSP users would not be ripping their UMDs but there'll be some type of

01:43:28.060 --> 01:43:32.160
digital distribution method on how it so it's gonna be a code in a manual that

01:43:32.160 --> 01:43:35.360
you're going to basically be able to download it to your system or something

01:43:35.360 --> 01:43:39.440
like that awesome so what's going to happen is someone's gonna basically by

01:43:39.440 --> 01:43:44.660
the game dump the code in return the game the end or they're gonna have it

01:43:44.660 --> 01:43:49.560
where it's your multifamily work for new games but what about the games you have

01:43:49.560 --> 01:43:53.740
right now see that's the problem is how they going to be able to do that and if

01:43:53.740 --> 01:43:57.460
it's a kiosk solution where you basically taking to kiosk and it dumps

01:43:57.460 --> 01:44:01.880
to your system that's a whole other problem right there it just there's no

01:44:01.880 --> 01:44:07.480
real way I see this working you know other than you know having it be a code

01:44:07.480 --> 01:44:12.560
manual and even then that's kind of iffy cuz now they say I my friend want to buy

01:44:12.560 --> 01:44:19.240
the same game assuming that I buy PSP games that I buy the game and then now

01:44:19.240 --> 01:44:22.520
we both get the game because I can basically share my copy with somebody

01:44:22.520 --> 01:44:28.040
else and of course Sony's motion controller what about the Sony's motion

01:44:28.040 --> 01:44:32.320
controller that they showed which basically to kind of summarize I mean

01:44:32.320 --> 01:44:34.680
I'm sure a lot of you guys have seen it you know I don't want to repeat things

01:44:34.680 --> 01:44:38.240
you guys I'm sure have been reading up on it but basically it's like imagine

01:44:38.240 --> 01:44:42.280
you're holding two I mean they look like wiimotes to me to wiimote looking things

01:44:42.280 --> 01:44:46.480
with balls on the end that that look like I kind of like they look like air

01:44:46.480 --> 01:44:50.680
traffic control things to me but they light up in these different colors like

01:44:50.680 --> 01:44:54.160
you can switch the colors and that's supposed to somehow send signals back to

01:44:54.160 --> 01:44:57.520
the system really it is kind of that patent we saw earlier remember how you

01:44:57.520 --> 01:45:00.480
talked about how there was this itoy patent and that it was going to be red

01:45:00.480 --> 01:45:04.120
dots and blue dots at the itoy could see that would differentiate it we thought

01:45:04.120 --> 01:45:07.200
it was something that was go on the regular controller well it's like this

01:45:07.200 --> 01:45:11.920
new little motion thing that has the things on it it looked up I mean I'm

01:45:11.920 --> 01:45:16.760
sorry but the controller looks retarded and you know the only cool thing that

01:45:16.760 --> 01:45:20.500
they did with it was the augment of reality stuff where like you see

01:45:20.500 --> 01:45:24.400
yourself and then you when you're moving the thing around it replaces it you know

01:45:24.400 --> 01:45:29.100
with an object in the game and that's kind of neat but then again the same

01:45:29.100 --> 01:45:32.440
time who is to say that none of these other systems can do the same thing I

01:45:32.440 --> 01:45:35.280
mean I like that demo that they were showing when they were doing like kind

01:45:35.280 --> 01:45:39.400
of the combat thing when they had like the they had like the archery that same

01:45:39.400 --> 01:45:44.200
thing yeah going on in the the sword fighting thing going on but there were

01:45:44.200 --> 01:45:46.860
some difficulty in the beginning remember you had a hard time hitting

01:45:46.860 --> 01:45:49.600
that tennis ball the beginning when they were showing it off and it was a risky

01:45:49.600 --> 01:45:53.260
thing to show it live so you know props to them for doing that but at the same

01:45:53.260 --> 01:45:59.580
same time. It's just it. The thing I worry about with these motion controls is how well

01:45:59.580 --> 01:46:03.500
are they really going to work. You know we kind of went through this with the Wii. When

01:46:03.500 --> 01:46:07.560
the Wii was announced I think a lot of us are jots at the floor and so forth. And now

01:46:07.560 --> 01:46:10.500
when we kind of want you know sometimes it doesn't work is now they're telling us they

01:46:10.500 --> 01:46:13.800
got to have motion plus because it doesn't work as well as they were intended. Here's

01:46:13.800 --> 01:46:19.860
what I want to the main focus I would like to see with this is what are the limitations.

01:46:19.860 --> 01:46:24.900
For example with the itoy controller that they have. The motion controller. Basically

01:46:24.900 --> 01:46:30.080
you have to use these two controllers in order to be able to utilize the game. Now granted

01:46:30.080 --> 01:46:37.220
it has little buttons and stuff like that on the controllers for different things. That's

01:46:37.220 --> 01:46:45.400
great but you know who's to say that you couldn't do the same thing with the Microsoft one.

01:46:45.400 --> 01:46:49.220
You know with maybe like you're holding the Microsoft controller as well or something

01:46:49.220 --> 01:46:52.720
like that because everybody's got the normal controllers. Who's to say you can't use both

01:46:52.720 --> 01:46:56.660
or maybe you know use it one handed or something like that or you know maybe they come out

01:46:56.660 --> 01:46:59.960
with something different you know for like shooters or something like if you really need

01:46:59.960 --> 01:47:05.260
the controller. But what are the limitations. It seems like with the Microsoft one that

01:47:05.260 --> 01:47:10.800
there's going to be a lot less limitations since you can use anything anything at all

01:47:10.800 --> 01:47:17.100
and it will basically you know figure it out for you whereas the Nintendo's you know controllers

01:47:17.100 --> 01:47:23.660
and you know too much lesser extent the PlayStation controllers are limited by the controllers

01:47:23.660 --> 01:47:28.020
themselves. Nintendo is bad because they now they actually have to add extra sensors to

01:47:28.020 --> 01:47:32.860
make it more sensitive how they wanted originally and still tied down by the IR and stuff like

01:47:32.860 --> 01:47:38.620
that you have to be facing the TV and the same thing with you know the the PlayStation

01:47:38.620 --> 01:47:43.020
I sensors or whatever now with these balls of color which hey I do like the fact though

01:47:43.020 --> 01:47:49.340
that it uses an already existing camera meaning that is not expensive that is nice but you

01:47:49.340 --> 01:47:53.660
know I'd also like to see the price point of the Microsoft one as well and at the same

01:47:53.660 --> 01:47:58.560
time now now you have to buy the camera and you have to buy the controllers for this so

01:47:58.560 --> 01:48:04.900
it might still add up to it being expensive in you know the camera is really kind of useless

01:48:04.900 --> 01:48:12.140
anyways right now. I mean I know because I own the cameras for both the vision camera

01:48:12.140 --> 01:48:17.340
and the PlayStation I and honestly haven't used either one of them really I mean other

01:48:17.340 --> 01:48:23.620
than trying out totem ball which sucked but it's just they're kind of useless and I mean

01:48:23.620 --> 01:48:28.780
Sony is doing a little bit more with the PlayStation I camera like they have the iPad thing coming

01:48:28.780 --> 01:48:33.180
out they've got you know some cool implementations for like you know photos and stuff like that

01:48:33.180 --> 01:48:38.300
and little big planets you know then the normal face mapping stuff for like the EA Sports

01:48:38.300 --> 01:48:45.060
games and stuff like that but I just don't I don't know they're going to make this controller

01:48:45.060 --> 01:48:49.380
a lot better looking and I know it's a prototype and I want to read this comment from chat

01:48:49.380 --> 01:48:54.440
because here Legend of Zaku in chat says Jesus Christ is a goddamn prototype remember that

01:48:54.440 --> 01:48:58.580
the PS3 controller is still in development so everything you saw last week is a prototype

01:48:58.580 --> 01:49:03.540
tech demo so the final versions of very once it's released well yeah but at the same time

01:49:03.540 --> 01:49:08.540
this is you know Sony is in front of the world showing it what is going to be playing in

01:49:08.540 --> 01:49:13.180
the next year so while there might be slight variations I mean this is what they are planning

01:49:13.180 --> 01:49:17.460
right now and unless something freaking major happens this this is going to be what it is

01:49:17.460 --> 01:49:24.020
next year see this to me looks like almost like a copy of like a Wii remote basically

01:49:24.020 --> 01:49:30.980
it's kind of what they're all how can we mimic what the Wii remote does but you know make

01:49:30.980 --> 01:49:36.900
it a little bit better and you know not use the same technology so don't get sued that's

01:49:36.900 --> 01:49:41.260
what this seems like whereas the Microsoft one was like how can we do something that's

01:49:41.260 --> 01:49:46.460
motion control but different and better and some folks in chatter invoking the PlayStation

01:49:46.460 --> 01:49:49.860
3 boomerang like GSAC it just changed his nickname like remember when the PlayStation

01:49:49.860 --> 01:49:52.760
3 controller was supposed to look like that boomerang yes and thank God they didn't do

01:49:52.760 --> 01:49:56.660
that because of all the negative reaction they didn't end up doing that so yeah you

01:49:56.660 --> 01:50:00.260
know Sony has been known to go back to the drawing board when they get negative reception

01:50:00.260 --> 01:50:05.100
so could something like that happen here yes and I just I think the whole setup is going

01:50:05.100 --> 01:50:09.980
to be really it's going to suck because you know once again going back to the Microsoft

01:50:09.980 --> 01:50:14.940
one you know trying to sound like a fanboy here but all you need is a camera done you

01:50:14.940 --> 01:50:19.360
got the camera you play four players 16 players whatever the game is going to support because

01:50:19.360 --> 01:50:24.540
you are the controller now let's go to Sony you need their camera you need a controller

01:50:24.540 --> 01:50:28.700
for each person or in this case this one game uses two controllers so how many controllers

01:50:28.700 --> 01:50:31.980
are they unbundled together am I got to buy each one separately well I have issues with

01:50:31.980 --> 01:50:34.460
the camera thing but we'll get to that when we get to Microsoft press conference yeah

01:50:34.460 --> 01:50:37.540
I think you do need both I think you do need the controller in the camera but we'll get

01:50:37.540 --> 01:50:41.760
to that when we get to Microsoft's thing I mean my Microsoft definitely has the ability

01:50:41.760 --> 01:50:46.540
to prove me wrong and I hope they do but we'll get to that in a little bit let's kind of

01:50:46.540 --> 01:50:49.740
wrap up with Sony did you have anything else you want to mention as Sony's camp I know

01:50:49.740 --> 01:50:55.860
one other thing I want to mention White Knight Chronicles was a really cool ask really yet

01:50:55.860 --> 01:51:01.180
actually one of our listeners was was kind of we ran into him around the White Knight

01:51:01.180 --> 01:51:04.360
Chronicles booth and we had a lot of good things to say about the game and I watched

01:51:04.360 --> 01:51:09.940
Loki play it and it's a very pretty looking game I had it described as Final Fantasy 12

01:51:09.940 --> 01:51:16.260
meets Xenogears and it was it was a very very pretty looking game I'm definitely interested

01:51:16.260 --> 01:51:21.820
in it yeah look you actually played it I had to watch you play that one what did you think

01:51:21.820 --> 01:51:26.260
of White Knight Chronicles how did it control it controlled fine it was just basically target

01:51:26.260 --> 01:51:31.160
something and then you had macros and pick which macro you want to you know which attack

01:51:31.160 --> 01:51:35.060
you want to do and then you can also set up a macro combo of attacks and stuff like that

01:51:35.060 --> 01:51:43.340
and I don't know it seemed easy but you know it was neat SSJ 100 Matt going back to the

01:51:43.340 --> 01:51:48.060
motion control in chat room chat.orangeonsrated.com says I think the fact that he gave a release

01:51:48.060 --> 01:51:52.020
date is what's bothering me spring 2010 is too they never stick to the release dates

01:51:52.020 --> 01:51:59.900
ever home got delayed how long ever the PlayStation 3 got delayed how long they never stick to

01:51:59.900 --> 01:52:06.140
release dates and why they even decided to do that is beyond me I I'm I want to I need

01:52:06.140 --> 01:52:10.200
to go grab some more water so talk more about Sony with our listeners looking okay so other

01:52:10.200 --> 01:52:15.940
things that Sony announced obviously there's a lot of stuff that was coming to their console

01:52:15.940 --> 01:52:20.980
including the PSP of course other things Resident Evil portable was announced which is pretty

01:52:20.980 --> 01:52:26.780
sweet we talked a little bit about Metal Gear Solid Peace Walker the PSP version there that

01:52:26.780 --> 01:52:32.820
was pretty cool coming to both the 360 and ps3 and I think we may get into this a little

01:52:32.820 --> 01:52:38.960
bit more but they have the new Metal Gear Solid Rising or the Raiden one yeah that's

01:52:38.960 --> 01:52:43.840
actually I wanted to find out if they did anything on that because I actually like Raiden

01:52:43.840 --> 01:52:52.860
yeah kind of cool and then you know there's they announced more stuff coming to home but

01:52:52.860 --> 01:52:59.000
I kind of zoned out when that happened the biggest announcement I think well they really

01:52:59.000 --> 01:53:02.980
show anything so it can't be that big of an announcement for me but Rockstar announced

01:53:02.980 --> 01:53:06.980
a new game franchise it's gonna be exclusive to the ps3 called agent that was gonna be

01:53:06.980 --> 01:53:11.700
about secret agents and stuff like that the problem I have with this those they also announced

01:53:11.700 --> 01:53:18.380
that you know franchise noir as gonna be a PlayStation exclusive at one time and we still

01:53:18.380 --> 01:53:23.940
haven't even seen that yet so let's finish one franchise first before we start announcing

01:53:23.940 --> 01:53:32.380
another one that's my thing though and then I did actually get to play the Motorstorm

01:53:32.380 --> 01:53:40.300
Arctic I forget the subtitle but the new Arctic themed Motorstorm game on the PSP that's pretty

01:53:40.300 --> 01:53:48.300
fun like a normal Motorstorm game actually look pretty good on the PSP I watched was

01:53:48.300 --> 01:53:52.940
it I you know they're White Knight Chronicles I watched some of the God of War stuff you

01:53:52.940 --> 01:53:59.820
know it looks just like you know normal God of War games they didn't really have I was

01:53:59.820 --> 01:54:10.700
hoping to play that others PSP games really have they have the add-on for a wipeout HD

01:54:10.700 --> 01:54:18.980
looked okay yeah but I kind of got a brief overview of everything that they had at Sony's

01:54:18.980 --> 01:54:22.220
booth and you know they got some pretty good stuff coming I didn't really see anything

01:54:22.220 --> 01:54:27.060
though on Gran Turismo 5 I mean they did announce Gran Turismo 5 is coming it's gonna be in

01:54:27.060 --> 01:54:38.620
400 cars you know great that it has 400 cars but you know the same time Forza 3 they announced

01:54:38.620 --> 01:54:46.740
the launch date for it and it's this fall so you better hurry cuz that looks pretty

01:54:46.740 --> 01:54:52.660
good too and honestly 400 cars sounds good but we really need 400 cars I wouldn't know

01:54:52.660 --> 01:54:57.980
which one to pick I wouldn't know either alright we need to do some of our regular segments

01:54:57.980 --> 01:55:01.860
here before we get to Microsoft's press conference you know it wouldn't be a week if we didn't

01:55:01.860 --> 01:55:07.280
say something angsty so let's do our FUs of the week folks how's that sound even though

01:55:07.280 --> 01:55:12.540
we haven't had anything angsty to bring this on but I don't know you know what I could

01:55:12.540 --> 01:55:15.940
say something angsty to invoke this would be how much stuff we didn't get to see at

01:55:15.940 --> 01:55:20.180
E3 there were way too many booths with way too much stuff behind closed doors what are

01:55:20.180 --> 01:55:24.500
you so afraid of so anyway bring on the angst

01:55:24.500 --> 01:55:49.420
um FU to not being able to go to E3 so that's blatant and for being somewhat sick okay

01:55:49.420 --> 01:55:59.180
FU to the Australian family that was eating next to us on Friday night I forget the restaurant

01:55:59.180 --> 01:56:06.580
but they were famous for ribs anyways apparently they like to yell a lot and talk about how

01:56:06.580 --> 01:56:13.700
their aunt and uncle have sex right in front of their kids so FU to them because they were

01:56:13.700 --> 01:56:20.700
loud and obnoxious and we were making fun of them all weekend long so yeah they they

01:56:20.700 --> 01:56:27.420
suck um I don't really have a lot of FUs you know I had the week off of work and that's

01:56:27.420 --> 01:56:30.460
always something to be excited about so FU to the fact that I have to go back to the

01:56:30.460 --> 01:56:39.580
old work tomorrow oh I got one more FU to my work for not actually finalizing my payment

01:56:39.580 --> 01:56:45.060
for my hotel that I stayed at in downtown LA sticking me with an $800 bill because they

01:56:45.060 --> 01:56:52.860
didn't um either they screwed up or E3 housing screwed up and my company which was supposed

01:56:52.860 --> 01:56:58.220
to have you know faxed an authorization for their credit card um that didn't happen and

01:56:58.220 --> 01:57:04.340
so I had to pay like $600 more than I was expecting oh screwed them we usually get reimbursed

01:57:04.340 --> 01:57:11.820
right I better fucking get reimbursed there you go ticket to man all right one of our

01:57:11.820 --> 01:57:15.260
other segments we always have to do here every week on the show is the part where you get

01:57:15.260 --> 01:57:19.100
to interact with us and that's where you send us emails at mailbag at orange lounge reader

01:57:19.100 --> 01:57:24.420
dot com and every week the lovely dark stalker jumps into the mailbag head first and uh lands

01:57:24.420 --> 01:57:29.660
with a few uh few emails on her forehead so uh she's gonna pick out some of her favorites

01:57:29.660 --> 01:57:38.660
and read them for you right now mailbag the first one comes from taz well loki you called

01:57:38.660 --> 01:57:42.900
it seeing how the lego games have been in the past year this one probably is going to

01:57:42.900 --> 01:57:46.700
turn out to be better than the rest of the harry potter games out there this is supposedly

01:57:46.700 --> 01:57:52.220
from years one through four and i'm and i'm guess we will see years five through seven

01:57:52.220 --> 01:57:56.940
and then some perhaps when movie eight comes out in 2011 i'm wondering if the game will

01:57:56.940 --> 01:58:04.340
follow the same lego star wars formula or would it go all new on us anyways i know i

01:58:04.340 --> 01:58:09.980
know have game for my soon-to-be wife which i'm probably going to enjoy as well the game

01:58:09.980 --> 01:58:14.620
you pervs thank you obviously he's talking about legos harry potter that got announced

01:58:14.620 --> 01:58:19.380
that it was coming out big surprise there um the only good thing about that is that

01:58:19.380 --> 01:58:22.140
means that toys are coming back because my wife was asking me about that we actually

01:58:22.140 --> 01:58:27.020
went to the lego store that was on downtown disney oh nice um but no lego harry potter

01:58:27.020 --> 01:58:32.540
uh weird stuff so they hopefully will re-release toys when that comes up um i would not bet

01:58:32.540 --> 01:58:35.980
they're gonna do anything new i think they have to stay pretty true to the books i think

01:58:35.980 --> 01:58:40.120
that might be some type of agreement i think he was saying as far as new as gameplay wise

01:58:40.120 --> 01:58:45.540
compared to the other lego indian jones stuff i wouldn't expect anything maybe the magic

01:58:45.540 --> 01:58:52.660
element but that's probably as far as you're gonna get so that's it the next one is um

01:58:52.660 --> 01:58:58.180
from cheeseburger hey guys you've been talking about your itunes ranking and how people leaving

01:58:58.180 --> 01:59:02.740
negative reviews pushes you back a few pages well i've been thinking that when people subscribe

01:59:02.740 --> 01:59:07.460
to a podcast that podcast rank will go up so is everyone unsubscribed and then resubscribed

01:59:07.460 --> 01:59:12.340
to olr in one week your rank would skyrocket am i right or is this just a load of crap

01:59:12.340 --> 01:59:17.060
i guess we could just test it out this week like set a date for the and then resubscription

01:59:17.060 --> 01:59:24.780
to olr oh and he wouldn't need to verify your email address um there's two ways that itunes

01:59:24.780 --> 01:59:29.220
rank shows and the one where it has like five pages of featured shows quote unquote we're

01:59:29.220 --> 01:59:33.600
not even on it anymore five pages of video game shows we're not even there anymore so

01:59:33.600 --> 01:59:38.340
i don't know you know i just just like i said word of mouth is all we got guys so i've kind

01:59:38.340 --> 01:59:44.140
of given up on the whole itunes thing um although yeah i think as far as the popular podcast

01:59:44.140 --> 01:59:48.420
you could probably unsubscribe and resubscribe but i'm going to tell you what coordinating

01:59:48.420 --> 01:59:53.980
that whole effort to get us to number 30 or whatever on the charts whatever it would do

01:59:53.980 --> 01:59:58.820
that would not have half the impact that those same people actually telling to people to

01:59:58.820 --> 02:00:05.160
download our show would have so while i appreciate the effort to boost the itunes ranking if

02:00:05.160 --> 02:00:09.640
you want to take that passion and focus it elsewhere i think there could be a better

02:00:09.640 --> 02:00:15.460
payoff so again you know we don't have money to fund commercials or anything you know again

02:00:15.460 --> 02:00:21.020
we are a uh independent operation out of a spare bedroom you know that's that's what

02:00:21.020 --> 02:00:24.820
it is so if you enjoy what we've been doing for the past seven years tell people about

02:00:24.820 --> 02:00:33.140
it that's all we ask um there's an email that i don't think i can read okay skip it do the

02:00:33.140 --> 02:00:37.020
next one it doesn't have punctuation let's do the next one then sorry you don't have

02:00:37.020 --> 02:00:42.020
to read them all i know but i will i usually like to read them as much as i can um but

02:00:42.020 --> 02:00:48.300
someone who really likes pepsi throwback which i've had me who does not like soda i still

02:00:48.300 --> 02:00:53.580
haven't had it it's good is it it tastes like old except it still has that oh my god i just

02:00:53.580 --> 02:00:59.420
sucked a spoonful of sugar aftertaste which is like honey but anyway where can i get it

02:00:59.420 --> 02:01:06.140
walmart everywhere i haven't seen it i swear the gas station down the street from my house

02:01:06.140 --> 02:01:14.620
i'll check that out okay um this is the last one and it's a bit long um and it is from

02:01:14.620 --> 02:01:23.500
i think spazzinator so i will just hop right on in and read it hi everyone i thought that

02:01:23.500 --> 02:01:28.500
i'd write in in order to bring up a few interrelated topics for today's show being today's assuming

02:01:28.500 --> 02:01:33.540
there is a show today yep there is you're listening to it hopefully before i get to

02:01:33.540 --> 02:01:38.060
the topics hand i'd like to apologize in advance if this email runs unusually long as i am

02:01:38.060 --> 02:01:43.860
combining two weeks worth of topics into one email first off in regards to what sky mentioned

02:01:43.860 --> 02:01:48.180
on the previous week's show coming back to final fantasy 11 i'd like to say congrats

02:01:48.180 --> 02:01:53.060
you had made a fine choice if i um if i may i'd at least like to think that i may have

02:01:53.060 --> 02:01:56.340
possibly played a small role in influencing you and returning to the game considering

02:01:56.340 --> 02:02:01.660
that i'm always talking about lolr how your return to venetial how's your return to venetial

02:02:01.660 --> 02:02:07.540
so far if you happen to be on either odin or alexander and see a tarot tarot named dare

02:02:07.540 --> 02:02:14.520
won't dare won't i can't i'm not on either of those servers anyway so i'm not gonna see

02:02:14.520 --> 02:02:20.820
i'm sorry that this is that would be me i play on bismarck oh never mind it's it's japanese

02:02:20.820 --> 02:02:28.980
is okay um on final on a final fantasy related note

02:02:28.980 --> 02:02:34.780
what are your impressions of the announcement trailer from e3 regarding the previous unannounced

02:02:34.780 --> 02:02:38.500
final fantasy i think we've been over this um personally i have mixed feelings about

02:02:38.500 --> 02:02:43.780
it on one hand being a big old final fantasy experience fan that i am i'd rather i'm rather

02:02:43.780 --> 02:02:47.540
excited about any upcoming final fantasy game and new story experience points that each

02:02:47.540 --> 02:02:54.100
game brings on the other hand i'm concerned that final fantasy 14 being an mmo will cannibalize

02:02:54.100 --> 02:02:59.980
final fantasy 11's user base hell for all i know final fantasy 11 may and i stress the

02:02:59.980 --> 02:03:05.300
word may shut down as a result even though i do plan to play 14 i still don't want to

02:03:05.300 --> 02:03:09.460
leave 11 or see any aspect of it suffer as a result the game has a damn good storyline

02:03:09.460 --> 02:03:14.340
and community um there will always be people out there wanting to play 11 you just might

02:03:14.340 --> 02:03:18.500
see some of the server consolidations and those types of things is that yeah inevitably

02:03:18.500 --> 02:03:22.460
some of the user base is going to go over to 14 that's just what happens but then again

02:03:22.460 --> 02:03:28.200
look at ever quest and ever quest 2 uh when ever quest 2 came out you know not a lot of

02:03:28.200 --> 02:03:34.020
people wanted to leave ever quest 1 and ever quest 2 kind of suffered because of that however

02:03:34.020 --> 02:03:38.420
i think there's a lot different going on here i mean for one it's final fantasy for another

02:03:38.420 --> 02:03:43.360
you have a lot of people and i can't stress this enough you have a lot of people who used

02:03:43.360 --> 02:03:48.140
to play 11 and left because things weren't fixed but i think there's gonna they're gonna

02:03:48.140 --> 02:03:54.140
want to give 14 a try so is it possible for both games to coexist yeah but i think 11

02:03:54.140 --> 02:03:57.620
will probably shrink down significantly in size but i think there'll always be people

02:03:57.620 --> 02:04:03.020
playing 11 somewhere there's still people playing ever quest exactly there's probably

02:04:03.020 --> 02:04:10.300
more people playing ever quest 1 than ever quest 2 so um but as far as the trailer when

02:04:10.300 --> 02:04:14.820
i saw the final fantasy 14 trailer uh let me just put it this way i looked up and saw

02:04:14.820 --> 02:04:22.120
final fantasy 14 and then i jizzed in my pants can i move on now please yes as a broader

02:04:22.120 --> 02:04:27.340
question what's everyone's impressions of this year's e3 um far away what do you what

02:04:27.340 --> 02:04:30.660
do you feel the high points as well as the low points additionally do you feel that there

02:04:30.660 --> 02:04:35.940
was a clear-cut winner between microsoft um nintendo or sony's conferences as a result

02:04:35.940 --> 02:04:39.660
of e3 would you say there's anything coming out between now and early next year that you're

02:04:39.660 --> 02:04:44.260
particularly psyched about well i think of this this show is going to kind of hit on

02:04:44.260 --> 02:04:47.300
all those points it's kind of what we built the show around tonight but i will say i will

02:04:47.300 --> 02:04:51.940
address the conference question between is there a clear winner between microsoft sony

02:04:51.940 --> 02:04:56.540
and nintendo and i'm going to say no there is no clear winner between the three i think

02:04:56.540 --> 02:05:03.220
the twitter conference wins i i guess i guess but i there there is no winner in my opinion

02:05:03.220 --> 02:05:09.240
because not enough is out there right now i think uh microsoft had a really good showing

02:05:09.240 --> 02:05:14.060
the the only thing i think holding me back from sony uh as far as you know grading them

02:05:14.060 --> 02:05:18.500
as high as microsoft is a lot of their stuff that they announced and granted microsoft

02:05:18.500 --> 02:05:24.980
is capable of this as well a lot of it is not coming out anytime soon you know uh microsoft

02:05:24.980 --> 02:05:28.740
you know they had you know crackdown 2 and stuff that they announced which will be getting

02:05:28.740 --> 02:05:34.500
into more of that stuff you know 2010 stuff but a lot of it they did announce with dates

02:05:34.500 --> 02:05:40.020
and time frames like this is coming out october you know this is coming out then instead of

02:05:40.020 --> 02:05:45.580
you know final fantasy 14 that's not coming out until like what next year that's part

02:05:45.580 --> 02:05:50.560
of our 10-year strategy exactly or like final fantasy 13 that's not coming out until next

02:05:50.560 --> 02:05:56.300
year or you know god of war 3 that's not coming out until next year um you know really the

02:05:56.300 --> 02:06:03.360
only games that they showed that were coming out this year were uncharted 2 and that's

02:06:03.360 --> 02:06:04.360
That's about it.

02:06:04.360 --> 02:06:07.400
I mean, so a lot of the stuff that they're talking about, you know, maybe White Knight

02:06:07.400 --> 02:06:10.920
Chronicles, I'm not sure about that, but a lot of it is all next year.

02:06:10.920 --> 02:06:12.680
It's that 10 year plan.

02:06:12.680 --> 02:06:16.800
And that's great that you're announcing stuff that's coming out, but Microsoft is announcing

02:06:16.800 --> 02:06:22.000
stuff that's coming out this year, and stuff that's coming out next year, and you know

02:06:22.000 --> 02:06:23.000
what?

02:06:23.000 --> 02:06:25.720
When it comes to next year, they will have more stuff to announce that's coming out,

02:06:25.720 --> 02:06:26.720
you know?

02:06:26.720 --> 02:06:27.720
That's the thing.

02:06:27.720 --> 02:06:29.640
That's what separates those two companies.

02:06:29.640 --> 02:06:35.920
Sony likes to promise a lot, but it takes a long time for them to come through with

02:06:35.920 --> 02:06:37.760
what they promise.

02:06:37.760 --> 02:06:43.040
And you know, Microsoft does the same thing to a lesser extent, I think, but I've just

02:06:43.040 --> 02:06:48.960
gotten tired of listening to what Sony has to say and promise, and know really what's

02:06:48.960 --> 02:06:49.960
gonna happen.

02:06:49.960 --> 02:06:54.960
Like, you know, Final Fantasy XIV, and granted that's not really up to Sony, but probably

02:06:54.960 --> 02:06:57.440
not coming out in 2010.

02:06:57.440 --> 02:07:00.160
Alright, we'll see.

02:07:00.160 --> 02:07:01.160
Was that it for emails?

02:07:01.160 --> 02:07:02.160
Any others?

02:07:02.160 --> 02:07:03.400
Oh, there was more to that one.

02:07:03.400 --> 02:07:04.400
Oh, okay.

02:07:04.400 --> 02:07:09.280
Um, for those of you that care, there's been some interesting stuff happening in the PSN

02:07:09.280 --> 02:07:10.680
store within the last two weeks.

02:07:10.680 --> 02:07:16.360
Sony's been continuing to put more PS1 classics on there, most of which are pretty damn good.

02:07:16.360 --> 02:07:20.400
Two noticeable ones for Resident Evil, director's cut complete with Jill sandwiches, and wait

02:07:20.400 --> 02:07:22.220
for it, Final Fantasy VII.

02:07:22.220 --> 02:07:23.760
You bought that, didn't you?

02:07:23.760 --> 02:07:29.640
I sure did, and I have yet to play it, because then I, literally as Final Fantasy VII was

02:07:29.640 --> 02:07:33.840
downloading, I remembered that Final Fantasy IV after years had come out on Wii, and I

02:07:33.840 --> 02:07:36.280
was like, no, I wanna play that!

02:07:36.280 --> 02:07:39.940
So I haven't gotten back to playing VII yet, keep in mind I was gone most of the week.

02:07:39.940 --> 02:07:45.320
And that's good that they have stuff to download now, some of their older PlayStation 1 classics,

02:07:45.320 --> 02:07:50.680
because they sure as hell aren't filling up their store full of new PlayStation Network

02:07:50.680 --> 02:07:53.680
games.

02:07:53.680 --> 02:07:54.680
True.

02:07:54.680 --> 02:07:56.680
I guess they need something to keep them afloat.

02:07:56.680 --> 02:07:58.680
There's more to this email.

02:07:58.680 --> 02:07:59.680
Okay.

02:07:59.680 --> 02:08:02.520
Um, where was I, okay.

02:08:02.520 --> 02:08:08.320
Once Jack Trenton mentioned that Final Fantasy VII was coming to the US PSN store, nearly,

02:08:08.320 --> 02:08:11.380
it says nearly I guess it's supposed to say every Final Fantasy fan collectively just

02:08:11.380 --> 02:08:15.080
their pants, um, no.

02:08:15.080 --> 02:08:20.440
They also added a bunch of other stuff on the game side, too numerous to mention.

02:08:20.440 --> 02:08:24.400
Additionally, they have expanded their offerings on the video side of the store to include

02:08:24.400 --> 02:08:28.480
somewhere in the ballpark of 10 to 15 more supported TV networks, including Showtime

02:08:28.480 --> 02:08:29.480
and G4.

02:08:29.480 --> 02:08:35.720
Additionally, they're giving away, um, for free, uh, two TV show pilots, um, Dexter from

02:08:35.720 --> 02:08:37.600
Showtime as well as Voltron.

02:08:37.600 --> 02:08:43.440
On a side note, although it's been on the video store, um, for a while now, I'd like

02:08:43.440 --> 02:08:47.080
to recommend that you check out this one anime series called Burst Angel.

02:08:47.080 --> 02:08:50.520
It's kind of difficult to describe, but it's essentially Charlie's Angels combined with

02:08:50.520 --> 02:08:54.400
X-Files with a dash of mechs and political corruption.

02:08:54.400 --> 02:08:56.560
Sounds odd, but it's a pretty good series.

02:08:56.560 --> 02:09:00.200
Considering that I usually don't watch anime, that's really high praise coming from me.

02:09:00.200 --> 02:09:02.700
Well, thanks for taking the time to read my email.

02:09:02.700 --> 02:09:03.700
It's appreciated.

02:09:03.700 --> 02:09:06.480
Again, sorry, especially to DarkSakura who usually ends up reading the emails.

02:09:06.480 --> 02:09:08.800
Thank you for such a long email.

02:09:08.800 --> 02:09:12.680
I do like how they are adding more anime studios to that because I think that's something that

02:09:12.680 --> 02:09:17.820
diversifies them a little bit, I'm not sure what their anime, um, you know, coverage is

02:09:17.820 --> 02:09:22.760
for the 360, but I know, I don't think there's that much on there.

02:09:22.760 --> 02:09:26.760
But that's kind of cool to diversify themselves a little bit with that.

02:09:26.760 --> 02:09:33.920
Um, I don't know, it's just, uh, one thing I do have a problem with though is G4.

02:09:33.920 --> 02:09:34.920
Really?

02:09:34.920 --> 02:09:35.920
G4?

02:09:35.920 --> 02:09:38.420
I mean, am I really gonna have to pay for shows that they repeat on their station like

02:09:38.420 --> 02:09:39.720
eight times a day?

02:09:39.720 --> 02:09:45.320
I mean, they only have, like, a handful of shows left and they just repeat cops and cheaters.

02:09:45.320 --> 02:09:48.720
I mean, are we gonna get episodes of cops and cheaters?

02:09:48.720 --> 02:09:51.520
I mean, is that gonna be part of the lineup?

02:09:51.520 --> 02:09:57.560
Awesome, I want the Excuse My Beauty transsexual episode, which I believe was Albuquerque Police.

02:09:57.560 --> 02:10:00.440
I would pay for that episode, I would, so I could watch that.

02:10:00.440 --> 02:10:06.240
Uh, Excuse My Beauty, officer, I'll go back to Arizona, I swear.

02:10:06.240 --> 02:10:10.980
If you haven't seen it, YouTube, Excuse My Beauty, it's amazing.

02:10:10.980 --> 02:10:12.980
That episode I would buy.

02:10:12.980 --> 02:10:14.720
The rest of that G4 crap can go burn.

02:10:14.720 --> 02:10:20.760
Unless it's, like, classic G4 stuff, like, you know, old episodes of, uh, Starrcade or

02:10:20.760 --> 02:10:23.160
something like that, but I doubt it.

02:10:23.160 --> 02:10:27.440
Uh, XLink in chat wants to point out G4 is free on iTunes.

02:10:27.440 --> 02:10:30.840
Brad from Pop Culture says, Cops is on Hulu, ooh, I didn't realize that.

02:10:30.840 --> 02:10:35.480
Sephiroth1215 says, speaking about the Sony press conference, I mean, we have to think

02:10:35.480 --> 02:10:36.680
of the years as fiscal.

02:10:36.680 --> 02:10:40.520
A lot of companies end their fiscal years in March, so they can release games up till

02:10:40.520 --> 02:10:44.800
that point and be keeping the truth of coming out this year.

02:10:44.800 --> 02:10:45.800
Yes and no.

02:10:45.800 --> 02:10:48.360
I still think a lot of this stuff when they say 2010, they don't mean March.

02:10:48.360 --> 02:10:49.360
They mean, like, October.

02:10:49.360 --> 02:10:54.080
They should say this fiscal year instead of this year, because that, I'm sorry, that's,

02:10:54.080 --> 02:10:55.080
I think-

02:10:55.080 --> 02:10:56.080
Lying by admission.

02:10:56.080 --> 02:11:01.560
I think the only games that might come out before holiday 2010 are Final Fantasy 13 and,

02:11:01.560 --> 02:11:03.320
at least in Japan.

02:11:03.320 --> 02:11:08.080
And uh, that's why I don't think 14's gonna come out in 2010, because I think 13's gonna

02:11:08.080 --> 02:11:09.560
barely make the holidays.

02:11:09.560 --> 02:11:10.560
So I think-

02:11:10.560 --> 02:11:12.560
But it's a different team working on it, so I could see that happening.

02:11:12.560 --> 02:11:15.640
That would be so weird if that happened.

02:11:15.640 --> 02:11:18.880
So uh, and then, uh, God of War 3 I think will come out early.

02:11:18.880 --> 02:11:19.880
No.

02:11:19.880 --> 02:11:20.880
No, you don't think so?

02:11:20.880 --> 02:11:21.880
March, for sure.

02:11:21.880 --> 02:11:22.880
Oh, March.

02:11:22.880 --> 02:11:23.880
Not.

02:11:23.880 --> 02:11:25.240
They already announced it's March.

02:11:25.240 --> 02:11:26.240
I see.

02:11:26.240 --> 02:11:27.520
So, well, okay, then that's before the holidays.

02:11:27.520 --> 02:11:28.520
So there you go.

02:11:28.520 --> 02:11:30.560
Uncharted 2 will be the big holiday game for them.

02:11:30.560 --> 02:11:34.480
Um, Mag was another game that they were showing off that I don't know if is gonna be out this

02:11:34.480 --> 02:11:35.480
year.

02:11:35.480 --> 02:11:36.480
It looked cool.

02:11:36.480 --> 02:11:37.480
I watched people playing it.

02:11:37.480 --> 02:11:40.760
I mean, if you're into like Call of Duty and stuff, you're really gonna enjoy that game,

02:11:40.760 --> 02:11:45.840
because it's, you know, a massive battleground, basically, of, you know, everything that you've

02:11:45.840 --> 02:11:51.120
seen in Call of Duty and, um, all your multiplayer first person shooter games.

02:11:51.120 --> 02:11:52.880
So that'd be kinda cool if that comes out this year.

02:11:52.880 --> 02:11:55.080
I'm not sure if it is.

02:11:55.080 --> 02:11:57.000
Um.

02:11:57.000 --> 02:12:01.000
I would hope that they put out Gran Turismo 5 this year, because I think they kinda have

02:12:01.000 --> 02:12:02.000
to.

02:12:02.000 --> 02:12:09.080
You know, with Forza 3 coming out, I mean, I don't know, um, and then, as far as what

02:12:09.080 --> 02:12:13.200
they're gonna fill in the rest of the year with, that's a good question, because I don't

02:12:13.200 --> 02:12:14.280
really know.

02:12:14.280 --> 02:12:19.480
I mean, Heavy Rain is supposed to be coming out this year, I thought.

02:12:19.480 --> 02:12:23.000
That wasn't even there, at all.

02:12:23.000 --> 02:12:24.560
Nothing.

02:12:24.560 --> 02:12:26.160
No mention of it at all.

02:12:26.160 --> 02:12:27.160
Alright.

02:12:27.160 --> 02:12:33.560
Uh, I believe that was all the emails we got, so if you wanna send us more, mailbag at orangelandrader.com.

02:12:33.560 --> 02:12:37.920
Let's move on to Microsoft, and then we'll let, uh, Loki throw in anything else he wants

02:12:37.920 --> 02:12:40.560
to, because I know he's probably got some other games he wants to talk about, and then,

02:12:40.560 --> 02:12:42.440
uh, wrap up with just a couple phone calls.

02:12:42.440 --> 02:12:45.560
Probably not gonna take a lot of phone calls tonight, just because we've been chatting

02:12:45.560 --> 02:12:47.680
a long time tonight, but we'll do what we can.

02:12:47.680 --> 02:12:51.560
Uh, anyhow, I wanna talk about Microsoft and some of the things they talked about at their

02:12:51.560 --> 02:12:52.560
press conference.

02:12:52.560 --> 02:12:57.800
Let's start with the big one, which is Project Natal, um, which obviously, you know, I, I'm

02:12:57.800 --> 02:13:01.960
pretty sure you guys are all aware, it's the motion controller that's camera only, there

02:13:01.960 --> 02:13:05.640
is no controller with it, I don't know if you've watched the trailer that goes with

02:13:05.640 --> 02:13:10.920
it, but it's very interesting, because the scene that struck me specifically was, when

02:13:10.920 --> 02:13:15.520
the girl walks into the room, and the Xbox 360 know who she is, and she gets a phone

02:13:15.520 --> 02:13:20.240
call from her friend, or whatever, on the 360, and her friend says, hey, I picked out

02:13:20.240 --> 02:13:24.040
this cute new outfit for you, you should try it on, and she kinda looks back and forth,

02:13:24.040 --> 02:13:27.720
and she actually is seeing herself on the TV in the outfit her friend picked out for

02:13:27.720 --> 02:13:28.720
her.

02:13:28.720 --> 02:13:29.720
Okay, that I don't buy, that's retarded.

02:13:29.720 --> 02:13:35.000
Which, which, by the way, reminded me of the movie Clueless, from 1990s, right, remember

02:13:35.000 --> 02:13:38.600
when Alicia Silverstone goes in the closet, and she can see what outfit she's wearing

02:13:38.600 --> 02:13:39.600
that day?

02:13:39.600 --> 02:13:40.600
Yeah.

02:13:40.600 --> 02:13:42.600
It's 1994, y'all!

02:13:42.600 --> 02:13:47.880
Anyhow, all that aside, that's crazy, let's just talk about Project Natal, I don't know,

02:13:47.880 --> 02:13:50.640
what were your thoughts?

02:13:50.640 --> 02:13:51.640
I think it's really cool.

02:13:51.640 --> 02:13:55.280
I thought, wow, this is really good, and I set them apart from Nintendo, they can do

02:13:55.280 --> 02:14:01.040
a lot more with this, if it actually lives up to all the stuff that they say it can do.

02:14:01.040 --> 02:14:07.640
And, I mean, they have kind of demonstrated, you know, the, their live demonstration of

02:14:07.640 --> 02:14:13.040
how, like, playing that giant Breakout game, which, it's a cool tech demo, but god, I hope

02:14:13.040 --> 02:14:18.440
that's not actually a game, you know, but it looked pretty innovative and easy to use,

02:14:18.440 --> 02:14:22.320
granted the person playing the game looked like a complete idiot, but hey, whatever,

02:14:22.320 --> 02:14:27.800
I mean, if that's, I'm sure playing Wii games people look like idiots, but, it looked easy

02:14:27.800 --> 02:14:32.560
to use, looked very intuitive, and I like some of the, I mean, it's very unnecessary

02:14:32.560 --> 02:14:38.920
as far as, like, browsing, you know, your menus and stuff by swishing your hand around,

02:14:38.920 --> 02:14:43.440
I mean, that's cool and all, but I'll just use the controller, because it's a lot faster,

02:14:43.440 --> 02:14:48.480
but you have the option, I mean, you don't have to do it that way, but then again, if

02:14:48.480 --> 02:14:55.000
I'm trying to, you know, shoo away my cat, I don't want it moving through menus, so,

02:14:55.000 --> 02:15:00.240
we'll see how that ends up, it could be really cool, and, I don't know, if they could come

02:15:00.240 --> 02:15:03.720
up with maybe, like, a one-handed controller or something like that, something really small,

02:15:03.720 --> 02:15:06.760
almost like the nunchuck or something, so you can, you know, say, like, you're playing

02:15:06.760 --> 02:15:09.240
a game- The Buzz controller, or, I'm not Buzz, sorry,

02:15:09.240 --> 02:15:10.240
the scenic controller.

02:15:10.240 --> 02:15:14.760
Yeah, something like that, you know, very small, so you can have some of that, you know,

02:15:14.760 --> 02:15:18.240
controller stuff, and then doing, you know, motion stuff with your other hands or something,

02:15:18.240 --> 02:15:21.240
like some of the things I think were unnecessary, like, that they showed in the video, like

02:15:21.240 --> 02:15:25.680
the driving, I don't want to have to hold my hands out, like a steering wheel, that's

02:15:25.680 --> 02:15:32.080
not for me, I mean, I'd rather not do that in the pit crew game, or whatever, where you

02:15:32.080 --> 02:15:37.280
change your tire, that is one of the slowest pits I've ever seen, and, no thanks, I would

02:15:37.280 --> 02:15:41.320
not want to have to play that little stupid minigame, or have someone else play that stupid

02:15:41.320 --> 02:15:47.600
minigame while I'm driving, because I'd be yelling at them for going too slow.

02:15:47.600 --> 02:15:48.600
Not for NASCAR fans.

02:15:48.600 --> 02:15:53.400
The skateboarding stuff looked kind of neat, I mean, the scanning stuff in, it's not going

02:15:53.400 --> 02:15:58.160
to work like they showed it, because the kid's hands in front of the skateboard, and obviously

02:15:58.160 --> 02:16:02.440
that wouldn't work, but it's a neat idea that you can scan stuff in there, and you can do

02:16:02.440 --> 02:16:07.200
that now, as it is with, you know, the cameras, you can scan your face to put it in games,

02:16:07.200 --> 02:16:09.080
so that's fine.

02:16:09.080 --> 02:16:13.820
The Avatar control was kind of wonky when they've shown it, because it had trouble figuring

02:16:13.820 --> 02:16:18.040
out where his hands were, so he's doing this cross arm thing, but you know what, that's

02:16:18.040 --> 02:16:22.260
happened in other things I've seen before, that have to do with, like, you know, like

02:16:22.260 --> 02:16:24.960
the little big planet characters, sometimes when you're controlling their arms, they get

02:16:24.960 --> 02:16:27.000
all wonky like that.

02:16:27.000 --> 02:16:33.440
So it looks neat, if it comes out in a relatively quick time frame, I think they'll be good.

02:16:33.440 --> 02:16:37.160
I'm not sure if it was supposed to be coming out this year, or next.

02:16:37.160 --> 02:16:38.160
It's gotta be next.

02:16:38.160 --> 02:16:39.500
I mean, it doesn't even have a name yet.

02:16:39.500 --> 02:16:42.920
It's Project Natal, that's not what they're going to market it as.

02:16:42.920 --> 02:16:45.440
So I don't know, we'll see.

02:16:45.440 --> 02:16:47.200
That sounds like a prescription drug's name, by the way.

02:16:47.200 --> 02:16:51.580
I am extremely, extremely skeptical about this.

02:16:51.580 --> 02:16:55.000
I don't think it's going to work as nice as they're showing it in these trailers and things,

02:16:55.000 --> 02:16:59.360
and this whole concept of people don't want to have buttons and stuff, that's just not

02:16:59.360 --> 02:17:00.360
true.

02:17:00.360 --> 02:17:02.440
I'm sorry, but I don't think that's true.

02:17:02.440 --> 02:17:06.480
And the whole thing about, well, people get intimidated by all these buttons and things,

02:17:06.480 --> 02:17:07.600
I don't buy it.

02:17:07.600 --> 02:17:12.180
You know what, there's one device everybody knows how to use, everybody fights over it

02:17:12.180 --> 02:17:18.060
all the time, when somebody loses it, people have hell to pay, it's the remote control.

02:17:18.060 --> 02:17:20.240
Everybody knows how to use a remote control.

02:17:20.240 --> 02:17:22.960
And that's what the Nintendo was kind of going for when they made the Wii, right?

02:17:22.960 --> 02:17:25.200
They want to make that Wiimote kind of like a remote control.

02:17:25.200 --> 02:17:29.000
So I don't think this whole concept of you have to get rid of the controller.

02:17:29.000 --> 02:17:30.800
But this is bait for idiots.

02:17:30.800 --> 02:17:32.920
That's all it really is, it's bait for idiots.

02:17:32.920 --> 02:17:37.840
Because you know what, they're basically relying on marketing this to the people that have

02:17:37.840 --> 02:17:43.400
the Wii, and they're like, oh my god, look at this, it's a game, it's without controllers.

02:17:43.400 --> 02:17:47.000
I don't have to worry about throwing it through the TV, I can play all these mini games that,

02:17:47.000 --> 02:17:52.940
or just like on the Wii, and guess what, the console's cheaper, and it looks better.

02:17:52.940 --> 02:17:56.360
And you know, you have all this stuff, you can do movies and all that kind of stuff,

02:17:56.360 --> 02:17:58.000
it's your air-tainment hub.

02:17:58.000 --> 02:17:59.320
I get it, I get it.

02:17:59.320 --> 02:18:00.320
They're gonna have that.

02:18:00.320 --> 02:18:03.840
But I just, you know, the fanboys are going crazy with this 360 thing.

02:18:03.840 --> 02:18:06.760
And I'm sorry, call me whatever name you want.

02:18:06.760 --> 02:18:10.360
I'm extremely skeptical about this whole thing, and I have a right to be.

02:18:10.360 --> 02:18:13.760
Because the Xbox Vision camera sucks.

02:18:13.760 --> 02:18:15.200
It sucks.

02:18:15.200 --> 02:18:16.640
What can you do with that camera?

02:18:16.640 --> 02:18:17.640
Exactly.

02:18:17.640 --> 02:18:20.240
Especially compared to what they showed us years ago.

02:18:20.240 --> 02:18:24.840
When they first showed us the camera, we were promised all these games that were gonna integrate

02:18:24.840 --> 02:18:25.840
the camera.

02:18:25.840 --> 02:18:26.840
And what do you have?

02:18:26.840 --> 02:18:30.800
You have Uno and some of the other Xbox Live Arcade games, and a couple third-party developers

02:18:30.800 --> 02:18:35.320
threw us a few bones there with the EA, you know, you have the Burnout license plate,

02:18:35.320 --> 02:18:36.520
big fucking deal.

02:18:36.520 --> 02:18:40.680
And then you have the, you're in the movies.

02:18:40.680 --> 02:18:42.460
And then Totem Ball.

02:18:42.460 --> 02:18:45.960
And remember when Totem Ball kind of looked fun from the previews that we were showing

02:18:45.960 --> 02:18:48.280
at that E3 when the Vision camera was announced?

02:18:48.280 --> 02:18:50.640
Now, Totem Ball might have actually been kind of cool.

02:18:50.640 --> 02:18:53.120
It was shit.

02:18:53.120 --> 02:18:56.960
And the way you controlled that whole thing, it doesn't, the same thing with the iToy.

02:18:56.960 --> 02:18:59.800
It is never picking up your body correctly.

02:18:59.800 --> 02:19:01.160
It doesn't see your motion right.

02:19:01.160 --> 02:19:06.240
If you don't have exactly the right lighting in your house, the thing sucks.

02:19:06.240 --> 02:19:09.240
And if you don't believe me, check out some of those iToy games on the PlayStation 2.

02:19:09.240 --> 02:19:10.240
They're terrible.

02:19:10.240 --> 02:19:15.840
So I think seeing this whole, you know, motion and movement is how we're gonna control our

02:19:15.840 --> 02:19:16.840
games.

02:19:16.840 --> 02:19:18.320
I'm extremely skeptical about it.

02:19:18.320 --> 02:19:19.320
I have a right to be.

02:19:19.320 --> 02:19:21.840
I've seen this before and it sucks.

02:19:21.840 --> 02:19:23.320
Why should I feel any different now?

02:19:23.320 --> 02:19:25.660
The technology has gotten way better.

02:19:25.660 --> 02:19:29.800
They actually have a company that's already perfected this and being implemented.

02:19:29.800 --> 02:19:35.520
It was actually implemented with a regular webcam at one time, but they've shown this

02:19:35.520 --> 02:19:36.520
at CES.

02:19:36.520 --> 02:19:37.520
It works.

02:19:37.520 --> 02:19:41.860
They've already gotten, you know, tech demos and games and stuff, you know, utilizing this.

02:19:41.860 --> 02:19:46.360
Microsoft bought the company and now they're working exclusively with them to put out this

02:19:46.360 --> 02:19:47.360
technology.

02:19:47.360 --> 02:19:53.400
And I do understand, trust me, I bought cameras for all those systems and they all pissed

02:19:53.400 --> 02:19:54.400
me off.

02:19:54.400 --> 02:19:59.960
And yes, I'm very skeptical on buying another camera that, you know, possibly not gonna

02:19:59.960 --> 02:20:01.040
work like I see it.

02:20:01.040 --> 02:20:05.600
And yes, I need to see it actually being used before I want to go buy this.

02:20:05.600 --> 02:20:07.800
But the technology is a lot different.

02:20:07.800 --> 02:20:10.280
They say, you know, now it's not utilizing your vision.

02:20:10.280 --> 02:20:12.160
It can track you.

02:20:12.160 --> 02:20:17.200
It can distinguish you between you and someone that's waving their arms in the background.

02:20:17.200 --> 02:20:21.320
You know, all that kind of stuff really helps because, you know, if I'm in the wrong lighting

02:20:21.320 --> 02:20:24.920
or something like that and it's not gonna be able to see me, you know, what the hell?

02:20:24.920 --> 02:20:30.480
So yes, and if it is gonna be as crappy and shoddy as those other cameras that have been

02:20:30.480 --> 02:20:33.520
out before, then there's no reason for anyone to buy this.

02:20:33.520 --> 02:20:36.200
But I have a feeling it's not gonna be like that.

02:20:36.200 --> 02:20:37.440
They've heard the complaints.

02:20:37.440 --> 02:20:39.520
It's, you know, it's gotta work.

02:20:39.520 --> 02:20:40.520
Let me read some comments from chat.

02:20:40.520 --> 02:20:45.200
There's a cypher in our chat room, chat.ornisontrated.com says, Johnny Chung Lee, the guy who did head

02:20:45.200 --> 02:20:47.520
tracking with the Wii is working on Natal.

02:20:47.520 --> 02:20:50.080
It has to work because he is pure genius.

02:20:50.080 --> 02:20:53.240
Tiger Claw says, in order for it to pick up the entire room, it's gotta be a widescreen

02:20:53.240 --> 02:20:57.280
view of the area so that everyone can be involved, insinuating that it's probably a widescreen

02:20:57.280 --> 02:20:58.280
camera.

02:20:58.280 --> 02:21:01.600
Well, it's a camera, but it's also got like other sensors on it too.

02:21:01.600 --> 02:21:04.340
So it's not just, you know, it's gonna be infrared.

02:21:04.340 --> 02:21:09.240
I think it's infrared because it looks like there's two infrared sensors on it or something

02:21:09.240 --> 02:21:11.620
unless those are just indicator lights for different stuff.

02:21:11.620 --> 02:21:17.260
But yeah, it's, the camera's really wide and it, you know, whether it's gonna be like echolocation

02:21:17.260 --> 02:21:20.440
or something like that, I'm not sure.

02:21:20.440 --> 02:21:23.280
But the camera is unusually wide.

02:21:23.280 --> 02:21:25.020
I want to keep reading comments from chat.

02:21:25.020 --> 02:21:26.020
Great stuff from chat tonight.

02:21:26.020 --> 02:21:31.020
Sephiroth1215 says, I feel more satisfied with the Sony Wiimote because while it might

02:21:31.020 --> 02:21:34.820
just be practically the same, it will be nice to play games with it that are meant for the

02:21:34.820 --> 02:21:37.560
core gamer, which Nintendo doesn't do.

02:21:37.560 --> 02:21:42.560
Zeba says, and in all the videos I've seen with it, their living rooms have so much room

02:21:42.560 --> 02:21:43.960
in front of the TV.

02:21:43.960 --> 02:21:47.480
I don't know any house that has that much room in front of the TV like that.

02:21:47.480 --> 02:21:49.320
Well, it's also a set.

02:21:49.320 --> 02:21:50.320
Yeah, true.

02:21:50.320 --> 02:21:52.580
But I mean, that makes a good point.

02:21:52.580 --> 02:21:54.600
Will this work in close quarters as well as far away?

02:21:54.600 --> 02:21:55.600
Well, how do you play?

02:21:55.600 --> 02:21:57.600
I can tell you for certain my living room is really small.

02:21:57.600 --> 02:22:00.060
Well, how do you play Wii Sports and Wii Bowling?

02:22:00.060 --> 02:22:02.560
Because I know that takes up some space.

02:22:02.560 --> 02:22:07.480
You know, I know when we're playing Wii Bowling and Wii Sports and stuff like that, we push

02:22:07.480 --> 02:22:09.440
out the coffee table, move it out of the way.

02:22:09.440 --> 02:22:13.080
And yeah, I know it's just one of the requirements.

02:22:13.080 --> 02:22:14.080
You gotta have space.

02:22:14.080 --> 02:22:15.880
And guys, don't get me wrong.

02:22:15.880 --> 02:22:18.720
When I say I'm skeptical, that doesn't mean I hate it.

02:22:18.720 --> 02:22:21.280
I think it's a great idea.

02:22:21.280 --> 02:22:28.440
If they pull off everything they're promising, I will bow down and suck Xbox's cock, okay?

02:22:28.440 --> 02:22:31.560
It truly is one of the greatest things I've ever seen in that case.

02:22:31.560 --> 02:22:35.280
But excuse me if I'm a little bit skeptical.

02:22:35.280 --> 02:22:38.720
I think I have a right based on some of the crap we've seen before, right?

02:22:38.720 --> 02:22:42.480
I fully agree.

02:22:42.480 --> 02:22:45.280
So I'm just cautiously optimistic.

02:22:45.280 --> 02:22:47.460
Okay, that's fair.

02:22:47.460 --> 02:22:49.680
Cautiously optimistic.

02:22:49.680 --> 02:22:54.080
Optimistic to the point of if this ends up being crap, then yes, I'm not gonna buy it.

02:22:54.080 --> 02:22:57.120
But I need to see it actually being utilized.

02:22:57.120 --> 02:23:02.440
And I trust that Microsoft would probably understand that, you know what, this isn't

02:23:02.440 --> 02:23:04.360
gonna be just for the casual gamer.

02:23:04.360 --> 02:23:09.440
Let's implement this and maybe some other stuff and see what we can do with it.

02:23:09.440 --> 02:23:13.600
Alright, moving on to some other topics, since we have a lot of ground to cover, I'm sure

02:23:13.600 --> 02:23:16.560
some of the callers are gonna want to revisit this because probably Natal is the thing that's

02:23:16.560 --> 02:23:18.160
got the biggest buzz out of E3.

02:23:18.160 --> 02:23:23.200
I do want to mention this, speaking of buzz, my Twitter has filled up with blah blah blah

02:23:23.200 --> 02:23:24.920
about 1 versus 100.

02:23:24.920 --> 02:23:29.840
And I feel completely out of the loop because I have yet to play it because I've not been

02:23:29.840 --> 02:23:33.440
home when all these beta tests have been going on or what have you.

02:23:33.440 --> 02:23:34.440
But is there...

02:23:34.440 --> 02:23:35.440
I don't know why.

02:23:35.440 --> 02:23:38.320
It's a freaking game show.

02:23:38.320 --> 02:23:40.780
You know what, if so many people are saying good things about it, there must be something

02:23:40.780 --> 02:23:41.780
good about it.

02:23:41.780 --> 02:23:42.780
People are having fun with it.

02:23:42.780 --> 02:23:43.780
That's what games are supposed to be, fun.

02:23:43.780 --> 02:23:44.780
They're welcome to it.

02:23:44.780 --> 02:23:45.780
So, I don't know.

02:23:45.780 --> 02:23:46.780
Loki, if you had a show...

02:23:46.780 --> 02:23:47.780
Oh, you know, you just got home today.

02:23:47.780 --> 02:23:48.780
Of course you haven't tried it.

02:23:48.780 --> 02:23:49.780
Of course not.

02:23:49.780 --> 02:23:50.780
Yeah.

02:23:50.780 --> 02:23:51.780
I definitely want to check it out.

02:23:51.780 --> 02:23:52.780
It's just I...

02:23:52.780 --> 02:23:53.780
It's so freaking popular on Twitter.

02:23:53.780 --> 02:23:55.280
I'm surprised it's not in the trending topic.

02:23:55.280 --> 02:23:56.560
So many people talk about it.

02:23:56.560 --> 02:24:00.280
Okay, some of the other things that were mentioned at Microsoft's first conference, Left 4 Dead

02:24:00.280 --> 02:24:02.160
2.

02:24:02.160 --> 02:24:03.880
It's got a lot of people pissed off.

02:24:03.880 --> 02:24:05.940
It looked cool, I thought, to me.

02:24:05.940 --> 02:24:09.600
When I first saw it, I thought there was this one game that was supposed to be coming out.

02:24:09.600 --> 02:24:13.560
It was like Voodoo something or other that had Samuel L. Jackson doing the voice of the

02:24:13.560 --> 02:24:14.560
main character.

02:24:14.560 --> 02:24:16.920
I thought that's what that was, and then they were all Left 4 Dead 2.

02:24:16.920 --> 02:24:20.200
I'm like, oh, I guess it could be that too.

02:24:20.200 --> 02:24:23.360
But a lot of people are just shouting too soon.

02:24:23.360 --> 02:24:28.220
In fact, there's a petition already with 13,000 people on it, which, you know, petitions

02:24:28.220 --> 02:24:32.640
online don't really do anything, but, you know, whatever, that are saying it's too soon,

02:24:32.640 --> 02:24:36.080
that they didn't support the first game enough, and that Valve's cashing in.

02:24:36.080 --> 02:24:40.880
Honestly, if you ask me, I think that you've been spoiled by Valve, and so now that they

02:24:40.880 --> 02:24:45.100
actually putting out another game, so what?

02:24:45.100 --> 02:24:47.600
Don't pick it up if you don't want to pick it up.

02:24:47.600 --> 02:24:48.600
But you gotta...

02:24:48.600 --> 02:24:49.600
Wait for it to go on sale.

02:24:49.600 --> 02:24:50.600
Yeah, wait for it to go on sale.

02:24:50.600 --> 02:24:51.600
I mean...

02:24:51.600 --> 02:24:54.060
They always have these crazy ass sales, you know, six months, a year later.

02:24:54.060 --> 02:24:57.680
No one's forcing you to buy it, but, you know, people are pissed off because they've been

02:24:57.680 --> 02:25:05.040
spoiled with, you know, all the Team Fortress 2 updates on PC, not on 360, but on PC, and

02:25:05.040 --> 02:25:13.320
all the other stuff, and whatever, dude, I mean, seriously, just, it's in a different

02:25:13.320 --> 02:25:14.320
setting, okay?

02:25:14.320 --> 02:25:15.320
When?

02:25:15.320 --> 02:25:16.600
I don't know.

02:25:16.600 --> 02:25:24.000
Different setting, you've got, you know, a little bit different game modes in there.

02:25:24.000 --> 02:25:26.160
If that's enough free to buy another game, then buy it.

02:25:26.160 --> 02:25:27.760
If not, then don't.

02:25:27.760 --> 02:25:31.280
Yeah, but Left 4 Dead has hugely rabid fans in it.

02:25:31.280 --> 02:25:32.960
I'm sure there's tons of people.

02:25:32.960 --> 02:25:34.040
This thing's gonna sell like crazy.

02:25:34.040 --> 02:25:35.280
Rabid indicates disease.

02:25:35.280 --> 02:25:38.360
Well, okay, I mean, here's their complaints right now.

02:25:38.360 --> 02:25:45.960
I mean, their complaints, basically, that for one, there is significant content for

02:25:45.960 --> 02:25:51.560
Left 4 Dead, the original that was promised but never delivered.

02:25:51.560 --> 02:25:56.080
Valve put little faith in Left 4 Dead 1 since it's almost certainly started working on

02:25:56.080 --> 02:25:58.440
Left 4 Dead 2 right after release.

02:25:58.440 --> 02:26:02.520
The fact that Left 4 Dead 2 is nearly identical to Left 4 Dead 1, it will decimate the community

02:26:02.520 --> 02:26:04.240
of both games.

02:26:04.240 --> 02:26:08.520
The announced date is not nearly enough time to polish content or make significant gameplay

02:26:08.520 --> 02:26:12.920
changes, which, all these are really assumptions on the development process, and since none

02:26:12.920 --> 02:26:16.760
of these people actually work for Valve, then I don't really know where they're actually,

02:26:16.760 --> 02:26:20.720
you know, how they're able to make these comments actually, you know, with...

02:26:20.720 --> 02:26:24.280
I seem to recall Left 4 Dead got some pretty awesome support after it came out, like there

02:26:24.280 --> 02:26:28.040
was a free pack that came out afterwards with some new stuff, you know.

02:26:28.040 --> 02:26:29.040
I don't know.

02:26:29.040 --> 02:26:30.160
I think you guys have it pretty good.

02:26:30.160 --> 02:26:31.160
The new...

02:26:31.160 --> 02:26:32.160
I repeat myself, wah.

02:26:32.160 --> 02:26:35.600
Yeah, the new character designs seem bland and unappealing so far.

02:26:35.600 --> 02:26:40.080
Left 4 Dead 2 is too bright to fit in with Left 4 Dead 1's visual aesthetic.

02:26:40.080 --> 02:26:41.760
Hey, it's a new game.

02:26:41.760 --> 02:26:44.320
It can have its own fucking aesthetic, okay?

02:26:44.320 --> 02:26:45.320
Get over it, shit.

02:26:45.320 --> 02:26:49.100
You know, just because a Resident Evil game comes out doesn't mean that every single one

02:26:49.100 --> 02:26:50.100
has to be dark.

02:26:50.100 --> 02:26:55.200
I do remember Resident Evil 4 taking place, or not 4, 5 taking place in Africa, and guess

02:26:55.200 --> 02:26:56.200
what?

02:26:56.200 --> 02:26:57.480
It was bright and cheery, but there's zombies.

02:26:57.480 --> 02:26:59.480
Did anyone bitch about that?

02:26:59.480 --> 02:27:00.680
No.

02:27:00.680 --> 02:27:05.460
The fiddle-based horde music is extremely disliked, though differently orchestrated

02:27:05.460 --> 02:27:08.160
in music is otherwise welcome.

02:27:08.160 --> 02:27:13.200
Left 4 Dead 2's release will result in a drop of quality and frequency of Left 4 Dead 1

02:27:13.200 --> 02:27:18.520
content even compared to before, and the community has lost faith in Valve's former reputation

02:27:18.520 --> 02:27:21.660
for commitment to their games post release.

02:27:21.660 --> 02:27:24.600
Waaaaaah is what I hear, because you know what?

02:27:24.600 --> 02:27:29.940
When I went to Microsoft's booth and EA's booth, guess where the lines were?

02:27:29.940 --> 02:27:34.720
For Left 4 Dead 2, so go suck it, because enough people out there fucking love that

02:27:34.720 --> 02:27:35.720
game.

02:27:35.720 --> 02:27:36.720
At least wait until the game comes out.

02:27:36.720 --> 02:27:37.720
Exactly.

02:27:37.720 --> 02:27:38.720
It's way too early to start, bitch.

02:27:38.720 --> 02:27:43.120
My god, you're going by fucking impressions and some brief gameplay clips and stuff like

02:27:43.120 --> 02:27:44.120
that.

02:27:44.120 --> 02:27:45.120
Play it, because you know what?

02:27:45.120 --> 02:27:48.320
I didn't see a lot of people crying and moaning about playing Left 4 Dead 2.

02:27:48.320 --> 02:27:52.040
They're playing it and seem to be having enough fun, so just get over yourselves.

02:27:52.040 --> 02:27:56.760
Seriously, been spoiled by Valve, and now you're fucking just bitching and moaning,

02:27:56.760 --> 02:27:57.760
but you know what?

02:27:57.760 --> 02:27:58.760
That's what fanboys do.

02:27:58.760 --> 02:27:59.760
They bitch and moan, so whatever.

02:27:59.760 --> 02:28:00.760
That's what we do here on this show.

02:28:00.760 --> 02:28:01.760
Three hours every Sunday.

02:28:01.760 --> 02:28:02.760
Exactly.

02:28:02.760 --> 02:28:03.760
Bitch and moan.

02:28:03.760 --> 02:28:04.760
Alright.

02:28:04.760 --> 02:28:09.480
The Halo series has Halo Reach and Halo ODST.

02:28:09.480 --> 02:28:12.040
Talk about milking a franchise.

02:28:12.040 --> 02:28:13.040
Holy shit.

02:28:13.040 --> 02:28:14.360
Oh, Halo's done.

02:28:14.360 --> 02:28:16.280
Oh, no it's not.

02:28:16.280 --> 02:28:20.080
We need to put out some more prequels.

02:28:20.080 --> 02:28:23.840
There won't be a Halo 4, but damn it, we'll think of everything else we can do.

02:28:23.840 --> 02:28:26.240
ODST looks kind of okay.

02:28:26.240 --> 02:28:29.760
Gameplay-wise, I don't know what they're really going to do different than Halo 3, and just

02:28:29.760 --> 02:28:32.440
to make sure that you're a sucker and buy ODST.

02:28:32.440 --> 02:28:36.160
They're throwing in a bunch of freebies, and they're also going to throw in a beta to Halo

02:28:36.160 --> 02:28:39.920
Reach, which we don't even know what the hell it is yet, other than it's going to be like

02:28:39.920 --> 02:28:42.520
another prequel.

02:28:42.520 --> 02:28:44.640
Awesome.

02:28:44.640 --> 02:28:46.360
Not interested in it one bit.

02:28:46.360 --> 02:28:49.800
Oh, and they're going to have a collector's edition, as they have to do with every Halo

02:28:49.800 --> 02:28:52.840
game, and they're going to include another Xbox 360 controller.

02:28:52.840 --> 02:28:53.840
Cat helmet?

02:28:53.840 --> 02:28:57.200
No, just an Xbox 360 controller that has special painting on it.

02:28:57.200 --> 02:28:58.200
Wow, are you a-

02:28:58.200 --> 02:28:59.200
Does it have a functional D-pad?

02:28:59.200 --> 02:29:03.760
No, but it's camo.

02:29:03.760 --> 02:29:08.520
Brad from Pod Culture in chat comments, ODST has Nathan Fillion.

02:29:08.520 --> 02:29:09.520
Ooh.

02:29:09.520 --> 02:29:17.360
Oh, well then that's perfect for all those fanboys out there who love Nathan Fillion.

02:29:17.360 --> 02:29:18.360
Crackdown 2.

02:29:18.360 --> 02:29:21.960
Okay, this is the only game I actually was really excited about hearing about it, because

02:29:21.960 --> 02:29:27.480
I love me some Crackdown, and I hope that god, there's no Halo Reach beta in this too,

02:29:27.480 --> 02:29:28.480
so-

02:29:28.480 --> 02:29:31.520
Didn't they say- oh no, the Reach beta's an ODST, I think.

02:29:31.520 --> 02:29:36.040
I know, but it doesn't mean they can't put another Reach beta into this, but yeah, it's

02:29:36.040 --> 02:29:37.040
going to be cool.

02:29:37.040 --> 02:29:39.800
They're going to expand the co-op in it to 4 players, which I think it should have had

02:29:39.800 --> 02:29:42.880
in the first place, and they're also going to have 16 player deathmatch in it, which

02:29:42.880 --> 02:29:43.880
is awesome.

02:29:43.880 --> 02:29:46.040
How about Shadow Complex?

02:29:46.040 --> 02:29:49.640
This is the one that Cliffy B came out, and y'all think it's going to be Gears of War

02:29:49.640 --> 02:29:53.920
3, but nope, it's a game called Shadow Complex, which is an Xbox Live arcade game, kind of

02:29:53.920 --> 02:29:56.480
looks like Bionic Commando Rearmed.

02:29:56.480 --> 02:30:03.040
I think it was supposed to be more like Castlevania and Metroid, is kind of what they were comparing

02:30:03.040 --> 02:30:06.040
it to, and it looked neat.

02:30:06.040 --> 02:30:12.000
I don't know if it's going to be a game I'm going to want.

02:30:12.000 --> 02:30:16.080
They were saying the rumor right now is that it's not going to be priced less than $20.

02:30:16.080 --> 02:30:17.080
Yikes.

02:30:17.080 --> 02:30:20.880
But anyway, it looks like it has quite a bit of polish to it.

02:30:20.880 --> 02:30:23.880
I didn't actually get to play it, but it looks neat.

02:30:23.880 --> 02:30:28.560
I mean, I'm glad to see he's not working on Gears of War 3, because really, come on, that

02:30:28.560 --> 02:30:30.680
would be just a broken record right there.

02:30:30.680 --> 02:30:31.680
What else?

02:30:31.680 --> 02:30:35.840
Forza 3, you've kind of mentioned a few times throughout the show, looked pretty neat.

02:30:35.840 --> 02:30:42.720
Pretty much like all the rumors were back in that one survey that they had going around.

02:30:42.720 --> 02:30:47.660
Two Disc, I think they said 250 cars.

02:30:47.660 --> 02:30:53.560
Really cool stuff, actually 400 manufacturers in there.

02:30:53.560 --> 02:30:56.200
They were going to have the ability to upload high def video.

02:30:56.200 --> 02:30:59.240
They actually have a video editor in there, which looked pretty sweet.

02:30:59.240 --> 02:31:04.160
Not really my cup of tea, but it's a neat feature, and then also kind of including the

02:31:04.160 --> 02:31:08.440
same stuff that they had in Forza 2, with all the designing cars, they kind of spent

02:31:08.440 --> 02:31:13.440
a little bit much, a lot of time on the whole designing cars thing, like, it was a way for

02:31:13.440 --> 02:31:16.200
me to express myself and stuff like that.

02:31:16.200 --> 02:31:25.040
That was a little bit, I don't know, ridiculous, if you ask me, because, dude, just, I don't

02:31:25.040 --> 02:31:28.120
know, draw something on paper or something.

02:31:28.120 --> 02:31:31.740
I don't know, seriously, there's other ways to express yourself, not this game.

02:31:31.740 --> 02:31:34.580
This game didn't just come out and go, oh my god, now I can actually express myself

02:31:34.580 --> 02:31:36.040
for the first time.

02:31:36.040 --> 02:31:38.760
I express myself through playing The Sims.

02:31:38.760 --> 02:31:43.940
Well, maybe you can upload some of these high def videos and pictures to the brand new Facebook

02:31:43.940 --> 02:31:45.760
integration on Xbox Live.

02:31:45.760 --> 02:31:46.760
Yeah.

02:31:46.760 --> 02:31:47.760
But wait, wait, it doesn't stop there.

02:31:47.760 --> 02:31:48.760
It doesn't stop there.

02:31:48.760 --> 02:31:51.020
Twitter on Xbox Live as well.

02:31:51.020 --> 02:31:52.800
The Facebook thing actually looked kind of cool.

02:31:52.800 --> 02:31:56.320
The only reason it looked cool is because you can actually, upcoming games are going

02:31:56.320 --> 02:31:59.000
to support this in-game screenshot thing.

02:31:59.000 --> 02:32:00.360
That's kind of neat.

02:32:00.360 --> 02:32:02.520
That's kind of neat.

02:32:02.520 --> 02:32:04.520
I don't know about Facebook and Twitter.

02:32:04.520 --> 02:32:09.000
I don't use Twitter that much, and Facebook I really don't use that much.

02:32:09.000 --> 02:32:14.960
It'll be neat, and I'm glad that they're adding more things, but, web browser, please, just

02:32:14.960 --> 02:32:16.720
add a web browser.

02:32:16.720 --> 02:32:17.720
Don't need all these things.

02:32:17.720 --> 02:32:18.720
Just add a web browser.

02:32:18.720 --> 02:32:19.720
Guess what?

02:32:19.720 --> 02:32:24.640
I can go to Facebook.com, or I can go to Twitter.com and add tweets that way.

02:32:24.640 --> 02:32:27.900
I have Facebook on my iPhone, so I don't need anything else.

02:32:27.900 --> 02:32:30.320
Add a web browser.

02:32:30.320 --> 02:32:35.200
And not just that, Last.fm was another integration they announced that's going to be there.

02:32:35.200 --> 02:32:36.200
That's pretty cool.

02:32:36.200 --> 02:32:40.760
So that you'll be able to, I guess, stream the Last.fm radio, I'm assuming, to the Xbox

02:32:40.760 --> 02:32:41.760
360.

02:32:41.760 --> 02:32:43.320
I kind of took that assumption.

02:32:43.320 --> 02:32:45.600
Or it's going to track your plays from the 360.

02:32:45.600 --> 02:32:49.680
I'm not sure exactly how that's working.

02:32:49.680 --> 02:32:52.120
I don't really use Last.fm.

02:32:52.120 --> 02:32:57.280
So exactly what kind of stations are we talking, like music hosted on servers, and we can stream

02:32:57.280 --> 02:32:58.680
stations based on artists?

02:32:58.680 --> 02:32:59.680
Well, here's the thing.

02:32:59.680 --> 02:33:05.240
On Last.fm, it basically tracks everything you play using a Scrobbler, everything that

02:33:05.240 --> 02:33:06.240
you play.

02:33:06.240 --> 02:33:10.200
So what you can do, once you've tracked some of your listening things, what it will do

02:33:10.200 --> 02:33:12.900
is it will actually develop a station that's your station.

02:33:12.900 --> 02:33:17.060
So any artist that has released the permission for their songs to stream, essentially, any

02:33:17.060 --> 02:33:21.400
of your songs that are released, you can have a station that's just your music that you

02:33:21.400 --> 02:33:23.280
can access from basically anywhere.

02:33:23.280 --> 02:33:28.040
The iPhone app, I am assuming the 360 in the future, or what have you.

02:33:28.040 --> 02:33:30.680
But also, you can do music you might like.

02:33:30.680 --> 02:33:33.840
If you like this, then you'd probably like this type of music.

02:33:33.840 --> 02:33:38.200
Because obviously, it's trending what you listen to and what other people listen to.

02:33:38.200 --> 02:33:41.760
Funny enough, if you listen to podcasts on iTunes, they get Scrobbled.

02:33:41.760 --> 02:33:46.200
So yeah, there's an entry for Orange Launch Radio on Last.fm, because people listen to

02:33:46.200 --> 02:33:48.660
our show, and so it goes into there.

02:33:48.660 --> 02:33:53.720
But I wouldn't think that this integration is going to mean that the podcasts are suddenly

02:33:53.720 --> 02:33:54.720
going to be listening.

02:33:54.720 --> 02:33:56.180
I don't think it's going to do anything for us.

02:33:56.180 --> 02:33:58.400
But yeah, podcasts are a small part of Last.fm.

02:33:58.400 --> 02:33:59.400
Very small.

02:33:59.400 --> 02:34:00.400
Neat.

02:34:00.400 --> 02:34:01.400
I know.

02:34:01.400 --> 02:34:03.700
It could be interesting.

02:34:03.700 --> 02:34:05.280
I'm not sure.

02:34:05.280 --> 02:34:06.960
We need to hear more about it.

02:34:06.960 --> 02:34:09.120
But that was kind of a surprise.

02:34:09.120 --> 02:34:11.040
Some of the other things that they talked about at the press conference.

02:34:11.040 --> 02:34:14.400
Final Fantasy XIII actually running on the Xbox 360.

02:34:14.400 --> 02:34:15.400
Which looked fine.

02:34:15.400 --> 02:34:16.800
Big deal looked like the PlayStation 3 one.

02:34:16.800 --> 02:34:18.000
I mean, not a big surprise there.

02:34:18.000 --> 02:34:20.720
Which we all knew it kind of should.

02:34:20.720 --> 02:34:22.940
Metal Gear Solid rising.

02:34:22.940 --> 02:34:23.940
Not four.

02:34:23.940 --> 02:34:24.940
Rising.

02:34:24.940 --> 02:34:28.560
And Metal Gear Solid was coming out.

02:34:28.560 --> 02:34:29.560
We already knew that.

02:34:29.560 --> 02:34:31.260
It wasn't a big surprise.

02:34:31.260 --> 02:34:35.240
But boy, when Kojima walked out on that stage, I bet there were a lot of people thinking,

02:34:35.240 --> 02:34:36.240
here it is.

02:34:36.240 --> 02:34:37.240
Here it is.

02:34:37.240 --> 02:34:39.920
Yeah, they were thinking, oh.

02:34:39.920 --> 02:34:41.800
And I love the way they worded it.

02:34:41.800 --> 02:34:45.880
Now the Metal Gear franchise has come to the 360.

02:34:45.880 --> 02:34:48.800
And they made it sound like it was exclusive.

02:34:48.800 --> 02:34:49.800
But it's not.

02:34:49.800 --> 02:34:50.800
No.

02:34:50.800 --> 02:34:51.800
No.

02:34:51.800 --> 02:34:54.800
Metal Gear Solid rising is not.

02:34:54.800 --> 02:34:56.400
I think this just cements.

02:34:56.400 --> 02:34:58.240
And I better not hear it ever again.

02:34:58.240 --> 02:35:01.640
Metal Gear Solid 4 is not coming to the 360.

02:35:01.640 --> 02:35:04.740
If it was, you would have heard it this year at E3.

02:35:04.740 --> 02:35:05.740
It is done.

02:35:05.740 --> 02:35:06.740
They have moved on.

02:35:06.740 --> 02:35:10.560
This is how they're getting Metal Gear Solid on the 360 is moving forward.

02:35:10.560 --> 02:35:15.400
There is a new Metal Gear Solid PlayStation Network and live game that's coming out.

02:35:15.400 --> 02:35:17.080
Just using the Metal Gear Solid 4 engine.

02:35:17.080 --> 02:35:18.080
Oh, neat.

02:35:18.080 --> 02:35:19.080
What game is that?

02:35:19.080 --> 02:35:23.040
I don't remember what it's called, but I remember hearing about it.

02:35:23.040 --> 02:35:24.920
Maybe that's that Metal Gear Solid arcade.

02:35:24.920 --> 02:35:26.120
That's probably what that is.

02:35:26.120 --> 02:35:31.840
I was thinking an arcade game, but it's actually for Xbox Live Arcade.

02:35:31.840 --> 02:35:34.400
So that's kind of neat.

02:35:34.400 --> 02:35:37.120
There you go, Metal Gear Solid 4 on the 360.

02:35:37.120 --> 02:35:38.120
Couple other games.

02:35:38.120 --> 02:35:39.120
Modern Warfare 2.

02:35:39.120 --> 02:35:41.400
I don't know if you are into this, Loki.

02:35:41.400 --> 02:35:42.400
No.

02:35:42.400 --> 02:35:43.400
Not my thing.

02:35:43.400 --> 02:35:46.640
Yeah, again, this kind of falls in the category of, hey, it looks neat for the people that

02:35:46.640 --> 02:35:50.360
are into that sort of game, but I can't play everything.

02:35:50.360 --> 02:35:51.420
Alan Wake.

02:35:51.420 --> 02:35:52.760
Let's close with Alan Wake.

02:35:52.760 --> 02:35:54.920
What did you think of this one?

02:35:54.920 --> 02:35:57.080
It's nice to actually see the game being played.

02:35:57.080 --> 02:35:58.400
A little weird.

02:35:58.400 --> 02:35:59.400
I don't know.

02:35:59.400 --> 02:36:00.400
The whole light-dark thing is kind of neat.

02:36:00.400 --> 02:36:01.400
Mine is a WiiWare game.

02:36:01.400 --> 02:36:05.840
Yeah, I wanted to know about that one because I wasn't sure on it.

02:36:05.840 --> 02:36:09.880
Well, here's a little trailer I can actually play here, except there's a lot to this.

02:36:09.880 --> 02:36:10.880
It's a very lengthy trailer.

02:36:10.880 --> 02:36:15.200
I came to the small town of Bright Falls on vacation with my wife, Alice.

02:36:15.200 --> 02:36:16.200
Now she's missing.

02:36:16.200 --> 02:36:18.200
Let me see if I can skip ahead a little.

02:36:18.200 --> 02:36:19.200
It's my fault.

02:36:19.200 --> 02:36:20.720
I'll actually try to show some of the...

02:36:20.720 --> 02:36:26.560
Yeah, I don't like the previously on Alan Wake because it reminds me of Alone in the

02:36:26.560 --> 02:36:27.560
Dark.

02:36:27.560 --> 02:36:28.560
Alone in the Dark.

02:36:28.560 --> 02:36:33.000
No one should have to remember that.

02:36:33.000 --> 02:36:34.000
I don't know.

02:36:34.000 --> 02:36:36.680
It looks like in the cutscenes a little bit silent and hilly, but I don't think that's

02:36:36.680 --> 02:36:38.000
how the game actually plays.

02:36:38.000 --> 02:36:40.640
There, you can see some of the game in motion there.

02:36:40.640 --> 02:36:42.640
That's something that made me motion sick.

02:36:42.640 --> 02:36:43.640
Maybe.

02:36:43.640 --> 02:36:44.640
It looks kind of neat.

02:36:44.640 --> 02:36:48.640
It's about these evil things that are invisible and then shine the light on people.

02:36:48.640 --> 02:36:53.440
Kind of like the Brian and Karen, you attack them and I don't know.

02:36:53.440 --> 02:37:01.040
What was that movie where the guy had the sunglasses and you could see aliens that way?

02:37:01.040 --> 02:37:03.040
Is it like that?

02:37:03.040 --> 02:37:04.040
It's black?

02:37:04.040 --> 02:37:06.080
No, They Live or something.

02:37:06.080 --> 02:37:10.640
It had Rowdy Roddy Piper in it.

02:37:10.640 --> 02:37:13.120
X Lincoln Chat says, it looks like Silent Hill meets Supernatural.

02:37:13.120 --> 02:37:14.840
That would be like Jamie's dream game.

02:37:14.840 --> 02:37:17.400
Yeah, that would really be my dream game.

02:37:17.400 --> 02:37:20.960
I think I would have to check this one out after all.

02:37:20.960 --> 02:37:21.960
All right.

02:37:21.960 --> 02:37:23.520
Loki, what did you want to add?

02:37:23.520 --> 02:37:27.880
I was going to add, there was one thing that didn't get announced at, actually a few things

02:37:27.880 --> 02:37:29.960
that they announced and touched on.

02:37:29.960 --> 02:37:34.380
One, some new enhancements to Netflix.

02:37:34.380 --> 02:37:40.380
They add, now you're going to be able to actually add stuff to your streaming queue straight

02:37:40.380 --> 02:37:41.920
from the 360.

02:37:41.920 --> 02:37:45.120
Not having to go back to your PC, which is kind of cool.

02:37:45.120 --> 02:37:48.240
And you'll be able to also browse through different categories on there.

02:37:48.240 --> 02:37:54.240
They're also doing some additions to the video store on there where you can do instant streaming

02:37:54.240 --> 02:37:55.240
stuff.

02:37:55.240 --> 02:37:56.240
So that's kind of weird.

02:37:56.240 --> 02:38:00.640
That's actually going to be able to, no buffering whatsoever, it's just going to stream, which

02:38:00.640 --> 02:38:04.720
I told that to some of my people at work and they're very skeptical on that.

02:38:04.720 --> 02:38:10.880
And also it's going to be upgraded to 1080p instead of just 720p.

02:38:10.880 --> 02:38:16.880
Of course the Xbox video marketplace is being relaunched at the Zune video this fall to

02:38:16.880 --> 02:38:21.880
kind of integrate it with their Zune HD stuff, which did not come up at the conference at

02:38:21.880 --> 02:38:24.240
all.

02:38:24.240 --> 02:38:31.200
And then also this one was a really big surprise, it didn't come up at the conference at all.

02:38:31.200 --> 02:38:37.960
You're going to be able to download full Xbox 360 games starting in August on their service.

02:38:37.960 --> 02:38:43.600
And you're going to be able to basically buy brand new games including Mass Effect, Assassin's

02:38:43.600 --> 02:38:47.080
Creed, Civilization Revolution.

02:38:47.080 --> 02:38:50.880
You can use Microsoft points or actually use a credit card to buy these games.

02:38:50.880 --> 02:38:54.720
And they're full retail games that do not require a disk at all and they'll store it

02:38:54.720 --> 02:38:55.760
on your hard drive.

02:38:55.760 --> 02:38:57.600
That just sounds a bit bizarre.

02:38:57.600 --> 02:39:03.320
Yeah, kind of interesting, the whole digital distribution thing, huh?

02:39:03.320 --> 02:39:06.720
Just like full?

02:39:06.720 --> 02:39:08.040
The whole damn game.

02:39:08.040 --> 02:39:11.240
That's pretty crazy.

02:39:11.240 --> 02:39:15.040
All right, so that pretty much wraps it up for everything I wanted to say about the press

02:39:15.040 --> 02:39:16.040
conferences.

02:39:16.040 --> 02:39:19.800
DarkSucker, I know you had a few stories you wanted to talk about tonight that weren't

02:39:19.800 --> 02:39:23.040
really necessarily tied in completely to E3, do we want to get to those?

02:39:23.040 --> 02:39:27.540
But some of it was touched on a bit, let me pull up.

02:39:27.540 --> 02:39:30.280
And then I'm going to probably just turn it back to Loki, see if there's anything else

02:39:30.280 --> 02:39:33.000
he wants to mention about E3.

02:39:33.000 --> 02:39:37.480
But we need to cover release dates at some point too, don't we?

02:39:37.480 --> 02:39:41.440
So we'll cover release dates as well and get into those.

02:39:41.440 --> 02:39:45.280
I unfortunately accidentally closed my release date page, so let me get back to it.

02:39:45.280 --> 02:39:48.280
We are going to go to the Skype line tonight, but since we anticipate there's going to be

02:39:48.280 --> 02:39:51.760
a lot of calls tonight, we're going to institute our two-minute rule tonight, which means no

02:39:51.760 --> 02:39:53.600
call is going to go longer than two minutes.

02:39:53.600 --> 02:39:56.760
We're going to be asking everyone the same questions, who are you and what did you think

02:39:56.760 --> 02:39:57.760
of E3?

02:39:57.760 --> 02:40:00.300
So we'll give everyone their two minutes, but since we want to get through a lot of

02:40:00.300 --> 02:40:04.160
calls tonight, just so you know, that's going to be the rule tonight.

02:40:04.160 --> 02:40:07.200
I know that might be sad, but at the same time, that means we get more people on the

02:40:07.200 --> 02:40:08.200
phone and that's happy.

02:40:08.200 --> 02:40:09.200
Alright, there we go.

02:40:09.200 --> 02:40:10.200
Be happy.

02:40:10.200 --> 02:40:11.200
Yeah, start talking.

02:40:11.200 --> 02:40:17.680
Alright, what we have is, for the 10th, this is UK releases by the way, we have Drakonika

02:40:17.680 --> 02:40:24.200
on PC, and then on the 12th we have EA Sports Grand Challenge Tennis, Indiana Jones and

02:40:24.200 --> 02:40:34.480
Staff of Kings on a bunch of systems, Prototype on PC, PS3, Xbox 360, and that's it.

02:40:34.480 --> 02:40:37.480
Going over to Japan, you might have heard me mention last week, there really is not

02:40:37.480 --> 02:40:42.080
a lot to look forward to in Japan this month, it's a very slow release over in Japan, and

02:40:42.080 --> 02:40:43.560
that continues to be true this week.

02:40:43.560 --> 02:40:49.460
There really isn't anything out on the Xbox 360 or the Playstation 3, although a big game

02:40:49.460 --> 02:40:53.420
is getting a price drop next week, I'll have to tell you about that next week, but going

02:40:53.420 --> 02:40:59.480
to some of the other systems, again, going to Japan, on the Playstation 2, again, nothing,

02:40:59.480 --> 02:41:03.520
there is literally nothing coming out in Japan this week, let me see if the DS is any different.

02:41:03.520 --> 02:41:10.900
Okay, on the DS you get Infinite Space is a new game from Sega coming out, that comes

02:41:10.900 --> 02:41:13.800
out this week, that is really the only big release on the DS.

02:41:13.800 --> 02:41:16.180
That's the new Platinum Games game.

02:41:16.180 --> 02:41:17.180
Is it really?

02:41:17.180 --> 02:41:18.180
Yeah.

02:41:18.180 --> 02:41:22.760
Trying to see if there's anything on the Wii to mention this week, Chibi-Robo, the Wii

02:41:22.760 --> 02:41:27.960
version comes out in Japan this week, as well as Metroid Prime 2 with Wii controls, but

02:41:27.960 --> 02:41:32.480
of course, as you know, it's coming out here in the US pretty soon, as a combined one,

02:41:32.480 --> 02:41:39.440
and then quickly looking at the PSP for Japanese release dates, I really don't think there's

02:41:39.440 --> 02:41:43.320
anything this week either, oh no, I take that back, of course there's another Neon Genesis

02:41:43.320 --> 02:41:48.040
Evangelion game, Kotsetsu no Girlfriend 2nd Portable, limited edition.

02:41:48.040 --> 02:41:56.240
Oh, they're doing, I've played that game too, the Girlfriend of Steel.

02:41:56.240 --> 02:42:02.640
Fate Unlimited, Kodes Portable is now coming to the PSP in Japan this week, it's a PS2

02:42:02.640 --> 02:42:06.680
game that's been ported, a 3D fight for the Holy Grail.

02:42:06.680 --> 02:42:08.480
That's it for Japanese releases.

02:42:08.480 --> 02:42:13.320
In the US there wasn't a whole lot this, or coming a week here, but today we had Legendary

02:42:13.320 --> 02:42:18.240
photography, it's a 2D platforming franchise from Nintendo that's finally made its way

02:42:18.240 --> 02:42:21.100
over to the United States.

02:42:21.100 --> 02:42:27.480
Also next week we'll be getting Tiger Woods PGA Tour 2010 on all platforms, a lot more

02:42:27.480 --> 02:42:31.720
games you're gonna see coming out supporting Wii Motion Plus, since that's also coming

02:42:31.720 --> 02:42:37.960
out on the 9th, including EA's Grand Slam Tennis, of course there's also the Tiger Woods

02:42:37.960 --> 02:42:41.520
PGA Tour Wii bundle with Wii Motion Plus.

02:42:41.520 --> 02:42:47.840
And then finally also coming out that, I think there's one other Wii Motion Plus game, oh

02:42:47.840 --> 02:42:48.840
yes!

02:42:48.840 --> 02:42:53.320
Virtua Tennis 2009 on Playstation 3, Xbox 360, and the Wii.

02:42:53.320 --> 02:42:58.880
And then other games other than Wii Motion Plus stuff, Prototype coming out on PS3 and

02:42:58.880 --> 02:43:02.080
Xbox 360 and then Blue PC.

02:43:02.080 --> 02:43:12.800
And also we've got some really crappy games, Diva Girls, Divas on Ice on the DS, and I

02:43:12.800 --> 02:43:20.600
think on the Wii, Indiana Jones and the Staff of Kings on Playstation 2, the Wii, the PSP,

02:43:20.600 --> 02:43:27.360
and I believe the DS, Vertigo, which is a marble blast type of game, that's gonna be

02:43:27.360 --> 02:43:31.400
coming out on the Wii, it's a budget title.

02:43:31.400 --> 02:43:37.880
Also this week, Rock Band Unplugged coming out on PSP, and also the bundle to go along

02:43:37.880 --> 02:43:38.880
with that.

02:43:38.880 --> 02:43:42.880
And back to crappy games, Pets Fashion, Dogs and Cats, yes a game where you can dress up

02:43:42.880 --> 02:43:46.420
both dogs and cats to look absolutely ridiculous.

02:43:46.420 --> 02:43:51.440
And on the Wii we have Go Play Lumberjacks, Lumberjack themed games, and Go Play Circus

02:43:51.440 --> 02:43:52.440
Star.

02:43:52.440 --> 02:43:54.960
I'm a Lumberjack and I don't care.

02:43:54.960 --> 02:43:56.760
Seriously.

02:43:56.760 --> 02:44:04.840
And then, let's see here, oh and then how could I forget, Guitar Hero On Tour, Modern

02:44:04.840 --> 02:44:14.360
Hits, the third DS game, not supporting the, you know, DSi, Pool Hall Pro, another budget

02:44:14.360 --> 02:44:19.280
Wii billiards game, and then finally on the DS, Lego Battles, the real time strategy game

02:44:19.280 --> 02:44:20.280
for DS.

02:44:20.280 --> 02:44:21.280
Alright.

02:44:21.280 --> 02:44:22.280
Sounds fascinating.

02:44:22.280 --> 02:44:27.720
Uh, DarkSocker, I don't know if you had anything else you wanted to mention.

02:44:27.720 --> 02:44:31.120
Um, yeah, actually yes I did, because it's about Tekken.

02:44:31.120 --> 02:44:32.120
Go for it.

02:44:32.120 --> 02:44:33.120
And I love Tekken.

02:44:33.120 --> 02:44:35.520
And Loki, we'll go to you with any other E3 things you want to report on.

02:44:35.520 --> 02:44:40.600
Um, actually it's just a report from E3 about Tekken 6, it has a beat em up mode.

02:44:40.600 --> 02:44:43.040
You can go around beating stuff up.

02:44:43.040 --> 02:44:49.960
Stomp em, smash em, and it has a story with it, and you can use guns and have giant robots.

02:44:49.960 --> 02:44:50.960
Well hooray for giant robots.

02:44:50.960 --> 02:44:53.840
Is that like the whole, like, Tekken 3 had it's beat em up mode in it?

02:44:53.840 --> 02:45:00.360
That's what I think, that's how I, um, but I mean, I think it's gonna be fun, I mean

02:45:00.360 --> 02:45:02.960
at least it's not like the crazy RPG mode.

02:45:02.960 --> 02:45:03.960
True.

02:45:03.960 --> 02:45:08.280
But I love, I love to meet some Tekken.

02:45:08.280 --> 02:45:14.760
Um, alright, and some other things that were kind of E3 related, uh, another part of the

02:45:14.760 --> 02:45:19.200
Microsoft press conference that they talked about, uh, the new game from Big Park, um,

02:45:19.200 --> 02:45:25.200
Joyride, it's a free to download, kart racing game, however free to download, but there

02:45:25.200 --> 02:45:30.560
will be additional download content that will cost money that, um, basically all these different

02:45:30.560 --> 02:45:34.440
micro, micro, uh, transactions involved with the game.

02:45:34.440 --> 02:45:37.760
But it is free to download, so free is always good, and at least you can check it out that

02:45:37.760 --> 02:45:38.760
way.

02:45:38.760 --> 02:45:40.160
It's like, just like a Korean MMO.

02:45:40.160 --> 02:45:41.160
Exactly.

02:45:41.160 --> 02:45:46.040
So, um, that'll be coming soon from Microsoft, and in fact, to kind of go along with all

02:45:46.040 --> 02:45:53.080
that stuff, um, Microsoft has announced their new Summer of Arcade, and with that, a bunch

02:45:53.080 --> 02:45:58.240
of games coming out, including Splosion Man, which I believe they had a trailer for a while

02:45:58.240 --> 02:46:04.600
ago, which looked kind of cool, the, uh, game from Epic Shadow Complex, TMNT Turtles in

02:46:04.600 --> 02:46:07.640
Time Reshelled, the remake of Turtles in Time.

02:46:07.640 --> 02:46:08.640
That's happy, happy, happy.

02:46:08.640 --> 02:46:09.640
Yes, please.

02:46:09.640 --> 02:46:14.480
Uh, the HD port of Marvel vs. Capcom 2, coming.

02:46:14.480 --> 02:46:15.480
Nice.

02:46:15.480 --> 02:46:22.040
Trials HD, which is based off of a Steam game, uh, Trials 2, 2nd edition, um, that's gonna

02:46:22.040 --> 02:46:28.320
be coming out, and also, to go along with, um, the more, you know, telltale games, adventure

02:46:28.320 --> 02:46:34.720
games, Monkey Island Special Edition, coming out with, uh, both, uh, remixed and original

02:46:34.720 --> 02:46:35.720
graphics.

02:46:35.720 --> 02:46:37.880
Oh, that was a huge thing announced at E3.

02:46:37.880 --> 02:46:40.600
And who, who played, who played Monkey Island?

02:46:40.600 --> 02:46:42.040
I played Monkey Island.

02:46:42.040 --> 02:46:45.920
That was a huge PC game, uh, the LucasArts series.

02:46:45.920 --> 02:46:50.720
Well, I mean, I just wanted to know if either of you guys actually played it, because I

02:46:50.720 --> 02:46:52.000
actually didn't.

02:46:52.000 --> 02:46:55.480
I didn't play that one, but I played Loom and some of the other ones that LucasArts

02:46:55.480 --> 02:46:56.480
played.

02:46:56.480 --> 02:46:57.480
Well, Loom, Loom, hell yeah, I love Loom.

02:46:57.480 --> 02:46:58.480
Yeah.

02:46:58.480 --> 02:47:02.880
I love me some Michael, er, uh, Monkey Island there, and I also, um, something else that

02:47:02.880 --> 02:47:07.640
made me kind of, uh, happy, is not only are they really seeing the original Monkey Island

02:47:07.640 --> 02:47:14.280
and the remixed version, but Telltale is working on episodic Monkey Island games that are going

02:47:14.280 --> 02:47:20.160
to be coming to all the platforms that normally receive the Monkey Island games, including,

02:47:20.160 --> 02:47:24.800
um, I believe Xbox Live, uh, PC and WiiWare.

02:47:24.800 --> 02:47:29.880
I think they only announced PC and WiiWare right now for the, uh, Monkey Island stuff,

02:47:29.880 --> 02:47:32.800
but I can only assume that it's coming to the other platforms, probably PlayStation

02:47:32.800 --> 02:47:34.420
Network as well.

02:47:34.420 --> 02:47:36.080
So that's really cool.

02:47:36.080 --> 02:47:40.200
Um, avatars are going to get some interesting stuff.

02:47:40.200 --> 02:47:44.920
You're going to be able to get unlockable clothing and, um, props for avatars based

02:47:44.920 --> 02:47:48.640
on achievements, and they were showing off some of the ones for ODST, which unlocks a

02:47:48.640 --> 02:47:53.120
costume for your character, so that's kind of cool that they're utilizing them in that

02:47:53.120 --> 02:47:54.120
sense.

02:47:54.120 --> 02:47:56.600
That's kind of cool.

02:47:56.600 --> 02:48:00.040
And yet still no trophy cabinets in home, although I will say I did play home this week,

02:48:00.040 --> 02:48:04.240
and they are slowly making upgrades to what we all thought home was going to be a year

02:48:04.240 --> 02:48:05.240
ago.

02:48:05.240 --> 02:48:07.960
So, yeah, you can finally put pictures in home.

02:48:07.960 --> 02:48:09.800
You can import pictures in your home.

02:48:09.800 --> 02:48:10.800
That's special.

02:48:10.800 --> 02:48:16.400
Um, some other stuff, um, going back to Microsoft again, um, some features they were talking

02:48:16.400 --> 02:48:20.240
about when they originally were showing off the new Xbox experience.

02:48:20.240 --> 02:48:24.200
Now you will be able to watch movies with your friends and also do the photo slideshows

02:48:24.200 --> 02:48:25.200
and stuff like that with your friends.

02:48:25.200 --> 02:48:28.400
I think you can actually already do the photo slideshows now, but you'll be able to listen

02:48:28.400 --> 02:48:33.400
to the music and stuff with your friends, so a feature that they showed off originally,

02:48:33.400 --> 02:48:36.920
you're actually going to be able to do it now, for the UK, um, audience, you're getting

02:48:36.920 --> 02:48:41.600
Sky TV, so you'll be able to watch, um, sporting events and stuff like that, which is kind

02:48:41.600 --> 02:48:44.200
of cool, um, with your friends.

02:48:44.200 --> 02:48:52.540
And then, um, let's see here, also, uh, some other random stuff, um, Xbox Live Arcade on

02:48:52.540 --> 02:48:57.680
June 17th will be getting Magic the Gathering as their downloadable title.

02:48:57.680 --> 02:49:05.160
Magic the Gathering, uh, Duels of Planeswalker, um, will be coming out, so, um, if you're

02:49:05.160 --> 02:49:07.960
a Magic fan, that's probably pretty exciting news.

02:49:07.960 --> 02:49:14.620
Um, on the Wii, actually, WiiWare in Japan is getting a new four player Pokemon fighting

02:49:14.620 --> 02:49:19.480
game that's coming, um, out on June 16th.

02:49:19.480 --> 02:49:23.160
No word on exactly how that's going to play, but, uh, it says, it looks like gameplay is

02:49:23.160 --> 02:49:29.560
real time, like Zelda or, um, Ys type action RPG, and, of course, four players can face

02:49:29.560 --> 02:49:39.480
off in the game's Battle Royale arena mode, huh, interesting, um, let's see here, uh,

02:49:39.480 --> 02:49:44.400
Team Ico, remember, I think we talked a little bit, um, last week that they were teasing

02:49:44.400 --> 02:49:49.920
that, um, there's going to be some Ico download content for, uh, LittleBigPlanet.

02:49:49.920 --> 02:49:53.280
Did they say what it is?

02:49:53.280 --> 02:50:01.400
Actually they have, um, they have some more teaser stuff to go along with it, but, apparently,

02:50:01.400 --> 02:50:06.040
it looks like it might actually be a level pack, like, uh, the Metal Gear Solid stuff.

02:50:06.040 --> 02:50:08.760
Sweet, I love the Metal Gear Solid level pack.

02:50:08.760 --> 02:50:15.720
Yeah, so, um, they have some stuff from Media Monocle, it's on their website, um, doesn't

02:50:15.720 --> 02:50:21.160
really show, it says it's, uh, Shadow Colossus stuff, I guess, is what it's supposed to be,

02:50:21.160 --> 02:50:26.280
um, they don't really, it's just, like, kind of teaser stuff right now, I'm trying to pull

02:50:26.280 --> 02:50:33.900
up their videos, see if it actually shows, haha, I don't know, but it looks like it's

02:50:33.900 --> 02:50:37.480
just going to be Shadow Colossus stuff, I don't know if it's actually levels or stuff,

02:50:37.480 --> 02:50:43.520
but, um, it's at least going to be stickers and costumes, so that's kind of neat, and

02:50:43.520 --> 02:50:50.160
they have, like, a Colossus, um, costume and stuff, uh, Tatsunoko vs. Capcom was shown

02:50:50.160 --> 02:50:53.840
at E3 this year, and they've announced that there's going to be five new characters for

02:50:53.840 --> 02:50:56.440
North America, since they've removed one.

02:50:56.440 --> 02:50:58.400
And they're taking out the Genie character.

02:50:58.400 --> 02:51:05.200
So, uh, that'll be kind of cool, uh, Perfect Dark, being remade for Xbox Live Arcade, we

02:51:05.200 --> 02:51:09.240
kind of knew that because of all the leaked icons and images and stuff like that, but

02:51:09.240 --> 02:51:15.360
it has been confirmed now, it's actually being, um, redone, um, or kind of, uh, updated, I

02:51:15.360 --> 02:51:21.120
guess, to run in 1080p, and it'll be coming out this fall on Xbox Live Arcade.

02:51:21.120 --> 02:51:30.720
Um, let's see here, some other stuff, like, they were showing off this game called, uh,

02:51:30.720 --> 02:51:35.200
Cop, the Recruit, uh, for the DS, it actually looked pretty cool, it actually looked like

02:51:35.200 --> 02:51:40.720
kind of the PSP Grand Theft Auto games, that's coming out from Ubisoft, uh, I think later

02:51:40.720 --> 02:51:41.720
this year.

02:51:41.720 --> 02:51:43.720
So that'll look kind of cool.

02:51:43.720 --> 02:51:44.720
Um...

02:51:44.720 --> 02:51:52.040
Why don't we take some calls real quick, a little bit of Skypline, because, yeah, we're

02:51:52.040 --> 02:51:55.560
already running into about three hours worth of show, it's about 930 here on the west coast,

02:51:55.560 --> 02:51:58.600
very late on the east coast, so I'm gonna go ahead and open up the Skypline tonight,

02:51:58.600 --> 02:52:01.360
try to get some calls out of the way, and then we'll see if Loki has anything else he

02:52:01.360 --> 02:52:02.360
wants to bring up.

02:52:02.360 --> 02:52:06.720
And if you guys want to share your E3 stories, so we can wrap up and get out of here tonight,

02:52:06.720 --> 02:52:09.000
try to get done before 10 o'clock tonight, so...

02:52:09.000 --> 02:52:10.000
Oh, come on!

02:52:10.000 --> 02:52:13.680
I know, but I kind of have to work really early tomorrow, so we're gonna start taking

02:52:13.680 --> 02:52:15.680
some calls, remember, two-minute rules in effect tonight.

02:52:15.680 --> 02:52:17.960
Hi, Aaron Orange, Orange Radio, who's this?

02:52:17.960 --> 02:52:21.240
Hey, this is DS Master 26.

02:52:21.240 --> 02:52:23.080
I'm sorry, was that DS Master 26?

02:52:23.080 --> 02:52:24.080
Yes.

02:52:24.080 --> 02:52:25.680
Alright, what's on your mind?

02:52:25.680 --> 02:52:28.280
Tell us about your E3 thoughts.

02:52:28.280 --> 02:52:34.480
Well, I watched it online, and of course, I also watched the Sony conference, the Microsoft

02:52:34.480 --> 02:52:41.920
and Nintendo ones blew me away, but Sony, boring.

02:52:41.920 --> 02:52:45.880
The biggest disappointment was, okay, you know how they had Chewbacca come out with

02:52:45.880 --> 02:52:49.160
the PSP 2000 Star Wars pack, right?

02:52:49.160 --> 02:52:50.160
Right.

02:52:50.160 --> 02:52:56.680
I can't believe how they did not schedule Miley Cyrus, aka Hannah Montana, to bring

02:52:56.680 --> 02:52:58.240
out the Hannah bundle.

02:52:58.240 --> 02:53:03.880
Seeing as that it got such a huge reception, yeah, but what was it that impressed you more

02:53:03.880 --> 02:53:08.080
with Microsoft and Nintendo that Sony wasn't delivering on?

02:53:08.080 --> 02:53:17.520
Like, they showed actual gameplay for Final Fantasy XIII, they showed off, you know, a

02:53:17.520 --> 02:53:25.040
few songs from Beatles Rock Band, which that was actually kind of awesome, and the Nintendo

02:53:25.040 --> 02:53:30.280
conference was actually really kind of cool when they showed off the other M, Metroid.

02:53:30.280 --> 02:53:33.440
So I'm like, this is freaking awesome.

02:53:33.440 --> 02:53:36.640
Was there more than just the Metroid that you enjoyed at a Nintendo's press conference?

02:53:36.640 --> 02:53:44.520
Um, that was pretty much, well, other than the Resident Evil stuff, but yeah, and cop.

02:53:44.520 --> 02:53:54.040
Because I'm like, come on, Rockstar, if Ubisoft can pull off full 3D sandbox games for DS,

02:53:54.040 --> 02:53:55.400
it's similar to GTA.

02:53:55.400 --> 02:53:56.400
Why can't you?

02:53:56.400 --> 02:53:57.400
You know?

02:53:57.400 --> 02:53:59.200
Alright, 20 seconds left.

02:53:59.200 --> 02:54:02.080
Any other thoughts about E3 you want to share?

02:54:02.080 --> 02:54:09.680
Basically, what I was talking about before my PSP went wonky, if Rock Band's dealing

02:54:09.680 --> 02:54:14.240
with a Lego, I'm betting you a full line, somewhere down the line, Guitar Hero's gonna

02:54:14.240 --> 02:54:15.720
pick up on Disney.

02:54:15.720 --> 02:54:17.480
It's bound to happen.

02:54:17.480 --> 02:54:18.480
We'll see what happens.

02:54:18.480 --> 02:54:19.480
Alright, time's up.

02:54:19.480 --> 02:54:20.480
Batav, good one.

02:54:20.480 --> 02:54:21.480
Thanks for calling in.

02:54:21.480 --> 02:54:22.480
Alright, peace out.

02:54:22.480 --> 02:54:23.480
Later.

02:54:23.480 --> 02:54:27.040
Uh, 1-877-GAME-OLR, our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.

02:54:27.040 --> 02:54:28.960
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio.

02:54:28.960 --> 02:54:29.960
Who's this?

02:54:29.960 --> 02:54:31.680
Hey, yo, what's up?

02:54:31.680 --> 02:54:32.680
It's Foodie Monster.

02:54:32.680 --> 02:54:34.400
Well, long time no see, Foodie Monster.

02:54:34.400 --> 02:54:35.400
How you doing?

02:54:35.400 --> 02:54:36.400
How you doing, guys?

02:54:36.400 --> 02:54:37.400
I'm doing fine.

02:54:37.400 --> 02:54:41.880
I actually moved countries, which is why I've been kind of able, or something, MIA and stuff.

02:54:41.880 --> 02:54:42.880
Where are you now?

02:54:42.880 --> 02:54:43.880
Oh, yeah.

02:54:43.880 --> 02:54:44.880
I'm in Chile, actually.

02:54:44.880 --> 02:54:45.880
Well, congratulations on the move.

02:54:45.880 --> 02:54:48.520
Alright, so tell us E3 thoughts, quickly.

02:54:48.520 --> 02:54:51.800
Okay, well, I actually wrote it down, so I make it faster for you guys.

02:54:51.800 --> 02:54:52.800
Let's see.

02:54:52.800 --> 02:54:56.560
Splinter Cell Conviction, oh my god, I look incredible, and I'm so happy with the direction

02:54:56.560 --> 02:54:58.560
they're taking that game.

02:54:58.560 --> 02:55:00.200
Assassin's Creed 2, love the first one.

02:55:00.200 --> 02:55:04.040
They promised to give us more diversity, and that's exactly what I wanted.

02:55:04.040 --> 02:55:08.000
Project Natal, kind of fucking wait, day one purchase, for sure.

02:55:08.000 --> 02:55:10.200
Scribblenauts, amazing.

02:55:10.200 --> 02:55:13.440
God versus cracking, I mean, really, that's all you need.

02:55:13.440 --> 02:55:18.280
PSP, excited about Sony, because they're really proving that they can support the platform

02:55:18.280 --> 02:55:19.600
this way.

02:55:19.600 --> 02:55:24.080
They're showing more stuff, more games to the little planet, a lot of things, RPGs,

02:55:24.080 --> 02:55:26.600
and I'm really excited about that.

02:55:26.600 --> 02:55:30.640
Definitely interested about The Last Guardian, that might actually get me to buy a PS3, because

02:55:30.640 --> 02:55:32.480
that looks great.

02:55:32.480 --> 02:55:37.460
And definitely my best of E3 thing, the best thing that happened in E3, Secret of Monkey

02:55:37.460 --> 02:55:42.280
Island Special Edition, and Telltale's version of Tales from Monkey Island, which is going

02:55:42.280 --> 02:55:44.840
to be the best thing since sliced bread.

02:55:44.840 --> 02:55:47.480
There are a lot of people very, very excited about that thing.

02:55:47.480 --> 02:55:51.480
With the time left, it's funny, because The Last Caller didn't really like what Sony had

02:55:51.480 --> 02:55:56.040
to say, but it sounds like you are very excited about what Sony had to say.

02:55:56.040 --> 02:55:58.240
You weren't turned off by the PSP's price point.

02:55:58.240 --> 02:56:02.840
Well, the thing is I already own a PSP, I'm not planning on buying another PSP.

02:56:02.840 --> 02:56:07.120
But I like the design, but if I were to make the jump and buy that one, I would have to

02:56:07.120 --> 02:56:11.120
wait until it gets to under 200 bucks, because 250 is a little bit too steep.

02:56:11.120 --> 02:56:12.920
All right, we've got 20 seconds left.

02:56:12.920 --> 02:56:15.520
Any other last thoughts you want to share with the listeners?

02:56:15.520 --> 02:56:19.880
Yeah, actually I just want to say to all non-believers, upon I click adventures, fuck you, they're

02:56:19.880 --> 02:56:20.880
back.

02:56:20.880 --> 02:56:21.880
Oh yeah.

02:56:21.880 --> 02:56:22.880
All right.

02:56:22.880 --> 02:56:23.880
Well, Woody, thanks for the call.

02:56:23.880 --> 02:56:24.880
It's a pleasure as always.

02:56:24.880 --> 02:56:25.880
Call back again when we have more time, okay?

02:56:25.880 --> 02:56:26.880
Will do.

02:56:26.880 --> 02:56:27.880
See you guys.

02:56:27.880 --> 02:56:28.880
All right.

02:56:28.880 --> 02:56:29.880
Later.

02:56:29.880 --> 02:56:30.880
1877 Game OLR.

02:56:30.880 --> 02:56:31.880
His name on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.

02:56:31.880 --> 02:56:32.880
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio.

02:56:32.880 --> 02:56:33.880
Who's this?

02:56:33.880 --> 02:56:34.880
This is Spazinator.

02:56:34.880 --> 02:56:35.880
Hey, Spazinator.

02:56:35.880 --> 02:56:36.880
You've got two minutes, E3 thoughts.

02:56:36.880 --> 02:56:37.880
Go.

02:56:37.880 --> 02:56:48.360
Yeah, I was impressed by both Microsoft and Sony's conferences.

02:56:48.360 --> 02:56:57.640
There's too much stuff to really list out, but both the Natal and the Sony motion controller

02:56:57.640 --> 02:56:58.640
do look promising.

02:56:58.640 --> 02:57:02.640
I can't see whether they're going to be good or not.

02:57:02.640 --> 02:57:10.000
I'm also kind of excited about the Final Fantasy release stuff, too.

02:57:10.000 --> 02:57:14.320
What do you think, since you're really excited about the motion control, how do you think

02:57:14.320 --> 02:57:19.480
Nintendo can catch up, or do they need to?

02:57:19.480 --> 02:57:23.600
I honestly don't know.

02:57:23.600 --> 02:57:34.920
I really haven't been following Nintendo at all for the past 10 years, so I really don't

02:57:34.920 --> 02:57:39.560
know enough about the Wii to really comment on that.

02:57:39.560 --> 02:57:43.520
Well, is there any other E3 thoughts you want to comment on tonight, then?

02:57:43.520 --> 02:57:45.360
No, that's it.

02:57:45.360 --> 02:57:47.560
Thanks for taking my call.

02:57:47.560 --> 02:57:48.560
Not a problem.

02:57:48.560 --> 02:57:49.560
Take care, Spazinator.

02:57:49.560 --> 02:57:50.560
Have a good one.

02:57:50.560 --> 02:57:51.560
Yes, you too.

02:57:51.560 --> 02:57:52.560
Later.

02:57:52.560 --> 02:57:56.600
Our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.

02:57:56.600 --> 02:58:00.760
If you want to give us a call, please make sure if you do use Skype, you want to test

02:58:00.760 --> 02:58:05.920
with Echo 1, 2, 3 first before you call, or else your call might sound like crap, and

02:58:05.920 --> 02:58:07.640
we don't want to have that now, do we?

02:58:07.640 --> 02:58:09.120
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio.

02:58:09.120 --> 02:58:10.120
Who's this?

02:58:10.120 --> 02:58:13.480
Hey, it's me, Legend of Zaku.

02:58:13.480 --> 02:58:15.200
Hey, Legend of Zaku.

02:58:15.200 --> 02:58:16.200
Two minutes.

02:58:16.200 --> 02:58:18.580
What do you think of E3?

02:58:18.580 --> 02:58:23.600
Pretty much, initially, it looks like Microsoft took it, but then again, Sony actually came

02:58:23.600 --> 02:58:33.920
out and tried very, very close to top them, but Nintendo pretty much came in like third.

02:58:33.920 --> 02:58:39.200
At least it was better than last year's Nintendo Presser, since that was a downer at best.

02:58:39.200 --> 02:58:45.600
But yeah, I just hope that Project Natal actually pulls through, it's actually the real thing,

02:58:45.600 --> 02:58:50.320
because Sony's already demonstrated something tangible in terms of what they're working

02:58:50.320 --> 02:58:52.980
on.

02:58:52.980 --> 02:58:55.640
Do you think that Sony might go back to the drawing board, because you were the one in

02:58:55.640 --> 02:58:56.640
chat that spoke up.

02:58:56.640 --> 02:58:57.640
It was just a prototype.

02:58:57.640 --> 02:58:58.640
Yeah, I mean, think about it.

02:58:58.640 --> 02:59:02.560
They just wanted to get a feeler this week, I mean, last week, when they showed it off

02:59:02.560 --> 02:59:07.760
at E3, just to gauge what kind of reaction they would get, and then they would incorporate

02:59:07.760 --> 02:59:15.340
any sort of feedback or anything that they may have not thought of into the development

02:59:15.340 --> 02:59:19.480
process while they still can, because they still got like, what, at least less than a

02:59:19.480 --> 02:59:23.000
year before they even release it.

02:59:23.000 --> 02:59:26.560
So they should have plenty of time to work out any final kicks before they market this

02:59:26.560 --> 02:59:27.560
thing.

02:59:27.560 --> 02:59:30.840
No one's answered this question yet, and you've got about 40 seconds left.

02:59:30.840 --> 02:59:35.280
Who do you think's going to be the first one out there, Microsoft or Sony?

02:59:35.280 --> 02:59:40.060
Yeah, and this is the issue with first to market.

02:59:40.060 --> 02:59:44.160
It all depends on whether Sony can outdo Microsoft.

02:59:44.160 --> 02:59:51.360
In other words, if Natal is going to get sidelined and delayed, then that works in Sony's favor.

02:59:51.360 --> 02:59:55.920
And then we'll see how, you know, we'll see that Natal is nothing more than a crock of

02:59:55.920 --> 02:59:59.680
a hyped up, hyped up shit.

02:59:59.680 --> 03:00:04.360
Quickly, do you think anyone might rush this and screw up?

03:00:04.360 --> 03:00:05.360
It depends.

03:00:05.360 --> 03:00:10.740
I think Sony has done a lot to the point where, you know, they could rush this, but they should

03:00:10.740 --> 03:00:12.600
have a decent product.

03:00:12.600 --> 03:00:18.240
I'm more worried about Microsoft, because we have yet to see the, we haven't even seen

03:00:18.240 --> 03:00:23.080
the real, you know, the real thing, and see the real unit on E3.

03:00:23.080 --> 03:00:29.520
You only just saw pictures of it and just trailers and demos that didn't even use the

03:00:29.520 --> 03:00:30.520
unit itself.

03:00:30.520 --> 03:00:31.520
All right, buddy.

03:00:31.520 --> 03:00:32.520
I got to let you go.

03:00:32.520 --> 03:00:33.520
Time's up, but thanks for sharing your thoughts.

03:00:33.520 --> 03:00:34.520
Have a good one.

03:00:34.520 --> 03:00:35.520
All right.

03:00:35.520 --> 03:00:36.520
Later.

03:00:36.520 --> 03:00:37.520
1877 Game OLR.

03:00:37.520 --> 03:00:38.520
Your username on Skype is Orange Launch Radio.

03:00:38.520 --> 03:00:39.520
Hi.

03:00:39.520 --> 03:00:40.520
You're on Orange Launch Radio.

03:00:40.520 --> 03:00:41.520
Who's this?

03:00:41.520 --> 03:00:42.520
Hi.

03:00:42.520 --> 03:00:43.520
Hello.

03:00:43.520 --> 03:00:44.520
Hello, SSJ 100 Matt.

03:00:44.520 --> 03:00:45.520
Two minutes.

03:00:45.520 --> 03:00:46.520
Ready?

03:00:46.520 --> 03:00:47.520
Go.

03:00:47.520 --> 03:00:48.520
All right.

03:00:48.520 --> 03:00:50.760
E3 overall, I enjoyed it quite a bit.

03:00:50.760 --> 03:00:57.640
I enjoyed Sony's conference the most, well, not really the most, but I enjoyed the, you

03:00:57.640 --> 03:01:05.000
know, Last Guardian, which actually made me cum a little, not going to lie.

03:01:05.000 --> 03:01:06.000
Thanks for your honesty.

03:01:06.000 --> 03:01:09.560
We're listening to KTMi.

03:01:09.560 --> 03:01:17.560
And I like mag, and then I could, that's all I could think of at the time, but the thing

03:01:17.560 --> 03:01:21.720
I wanted to call in about was Natal.

03:01:21.720 --> 03:01:27.080
I think I mentioned this on Twitter, you know, I 100% agree with you.

03:01:27.080 --> 03:01:31.920
We should be skeptical of this thing, because, you know, they talk pretty big with tech demo

03:01:31.920 --> 03:01:37.060
videos, but, you know, until we get something tangible, because they didn't really show

03:01:37.060 --> 03:01:46.080
us anything hands-on at the demonstration, just, you know, really the paint thing and

03:01:46.080 --> 03:01:52.100
the break, the breakout type thing, but, you know, I would like to see what the third party

03:01:52.100 --> 03:01:56.980
developers are going to do with this and whether or not they can pull something out off quick

03:01:56.980 --> 03:02:02.340
enough that's, that will be before the end of the three sixties life cycle.

03:02:02.340 --> 03:02:05.420
Now that they have their development kits, which apparently they just got.

03:02:05.420 --> 03:02:08.440
So that's why I think this thing's still a ways out, but quickly, since you don't have

03:02:08.440 --> 03:02:11.160
a lot of time left, any other thoughts you wanted to share?

03:02:11.160 --> 03:02:14.160
This is Jay.

03:02:14.160 --> 03:02:15.160
Two things.

03:02:15.160 --> 03:02:20.240
I was kind of disappointed that they didn't, that weren't at E3, I'm disappointed that

03:02:20.240 --> 03:02:24.640
Microsoft didn't mention anything about XNA, what they plan on doing with that.

03:02:24.640 --> 03:02:26.800
Oh, that's a damn good point.

03:02:26.800 --> 03:02:27.800
You're right.

03:02:27.800 --> 03:02:28.800
There wasn't anything on that.

03:02:28.800 --> 03:02:29.800
Okay.

03:02:29.800 --> 03:02:30.800
Cause they didn't mention anything about it.

03:02:30.800 --> 03:02:35.920
And, you know, they're going to kick it to the curb and treat it like the bastard child

03:02:35.920 --> 03:02:36.920
it is.

03:02:36.920 --> 03:02:37.920
What's the other thing.

03:02:37.920 --> 03:02:43.800
And, um, and I was wondering where's Final Fantasy 13 versus.

03:02:43.800 --> 03:02:44.800
Good question.

03:02:44.800 --> 03:02:45.800
Good.

03:02:45.800 --> 03:02:46.800
Yeah.

03:02:46.800 --> 03:02:47.800
Nowhere to be seen 2011, if we're lucky.

03:02:47.800 --> 03:02:48.800
All right.

03:02:48.800 --> 03:02:50.800
As Jay 100, Matt, we got to let you go, but thanks for your thoughts.

03:02:50.800 --> 03:02:51.800
Yep.

03:02:51.800 --> 03:02:52.800
Boba Fett.

03:02:52.800 --> 03:02:53.800
Take care.

03:02:53.800 --> 03:02:57.640
Um, and you know, one thing about Microsoft's booth, you should know, usually Microsoft

03:02:57.640 --> 03:02:58.800
is one of the most open companies.

03:02:58.800 --> 03:03:02.320
Like they have one of the most open booths this year was like they were on lockdown.

03:03:02.320 --> 03:03:06.080
There wasn't a lot to see in Microsoft's booth, unless you were a special person with a special

03:03:06.080 --> 03:03:10.400
invite to go see the special things such as the demo of project at all and so forth.

03:03:10.400 --> 03:03:13.140
They did not have anything like that out in the open this year.

03:03:13.140 --> 03:03:14.560
Is it a coincidence?

03:03:14.560 --> 03:03:18.760
The same year they let go a lot of their community people like the gamerscore blog folks, the

03:03:18.760 --> 03:03:23.920
same year that happens, the Microsoft seems to be closed down a little more to the community.

03:03:23.920 --> 03:03:24.920
I don't know.

03:03:24.920 --> 03:03:25.920
Coincidence.

03:03:25.920 --> 03:03:31.160
I was looking at, they have a really close up picture of the Natal camera and it looks

03:03:31.160 --> 03:03:37.680
like it's got two sensors on it or two like, um, you know, actual cameras on it.

03:03:37.680 --> 03:03:41.840
Almost like I think they're going to detect depth the same way as a human would detect

03:03:41.840 --> 03:03:46.040
depth, you know, with the differences between the two images and figuring out where you

03:03:46.040 --> 03:03:47.040
are based on that.

03:03:47.040 --> 03:03:48.200
I think that's exactly what they're doing.

03:03:48.200 --> 03:03:49.560
I think you're, I think you're right on track.

03:03:49.560 --> 03:03:53.520
I think it's like the stereo images, you know, where you stare at it and the, you know, where

03:03:53.520 --> 03:03:56.600
the two dots come together and you're supposed to see this, the sail ship and all that.

03:03:56.600 --> 03:03:58.760
Are you going to be able to see the sailboat?

03:03:58.760 --> 03:03:59.760
I don't know.

03:03:59.760 --> 03:04:00.760
I'll try it.

03:04:00.760 --> 03:04:01.760
Let's do one more call guys.

03:04:01.760 --> 03:04:02.760
Uh, hi, you're on orange launch radio.

03:04:02.760 --> 03:04:03.760
Who's this?

03:04:03.760 --> 03:04:04.760
Hello?

03:04:04.760 --> 03:04:05.760
Hello.

03:04:05.760 --> 03:04:06.760
Who's this?

03:04:06.760 --> 03:04:07.760
This is Marissa.

03:04:07.760 --> 03:04:08.760
Hi, Marissa.

03:04:08.760 --> 03:04:09.760
How are you my friend?

03:04:09.760 --> 03:04:10.760
I'm all right.

03:04:10.760 --> 03:04:11.760
How are you?

03:04:11.760 --> 03:04:12.760
I'm sorry.

03:04:12.760 --> 03:04:18.760
I just want to leave the house for all of these fans of what was called call of beauty

03:04:18.760 --> 03:04:19.760
right now.

03:04:19.760 --> 03:04:20.760
Oh, well, awesome.

03:04:20.760 --> 03:04:24.360
Well, we're, we're talking about E3, but you've only got two minutes on, so what's on your

03:04:24.360 --> 03:04:25.360
mind?

03:04:25.360 --> 03:04:30.920
I just called to say hello and, um, the biggest disappointment of E3 was that you did not

03:04:30.920 --> 03:04:31.920
call me.

03:04:31.920 --> 03:04:32.920
I know.

03:04:32.920 --> 03:04:34.000
I'm so sorry, Marissa.

03:04:34.000 --> 03:04:37.860
I was just, I got so busy down there was my first trip with my boyfriend and everything

03:04:37.860 --> 03:04:40.440
who's from LA and all this other stuff planned, but

03:04:40.440 --> 03:04:41.440
I'm just teasing you.

03:04:41.440 --> 03:04:45.500
Actually, the only like relevant gamer news to me is that I just found out they're coming

03:04:45.500 --> 03:04:46.880
out with a C4.

03:04:46.880 --> 03:04:53.360
Which is completely irrelevant to E3, but I just like clap my pants.

03:04:53.360 --> 03:04:57.360
I guess there's a rule now it's the 11th, but my boyfriend just saw me dancing out in

03:04:57.360 --> 03:04:58.360
the apartment.

03:04:58.360 --> 03:05:00.960
He's like, you're a little too happy to see me, but you're happy that this game is coming

03:05:00.960 --> 03:05:01.960
out?

03:05:01.960 --> 03:05:02.960
Yes, honey.

03:05:02.960 --> 03:05:04.960
Darren has a much sexier voice.

03:05:04.960 --> 03:05:05.960
Nice.

03:05:05.960 --> 03:05:10.800
Anyway, I also want to, I wanted to remind you to call the person who shall not be named

03:05:10.800 --> 03:05:12.360
who I've been bothering you to call.

03:05:12.360 --> 03:05:13.360
Yes, we will.

03:05:13.360 --> 03:05:16.400
We will definitely get on that now that all the craziness of our expo is over and we're

03:05:16.400 --> 03:05:17.400
bored again.

03:05:17.400 --> 03:05:18.400
At least until PAX.

03:05:18.400 --> 03:05:19.400
All right.

03:05:19.400 --> 03:05:20.400
It sounded wonderful.

03:05:20.400 --> 03:05:22.400
I'm so excited to hear all the updates.

03:05:22.400 --> 03:05:27.520
It was in town, but all the LAers knew about it was that it kind of fucked up traffic.

03:05:27.520 --> 03:05:29.520
That's all we know about it.

03:05:29.520 --> 03:05:32.280
Well, hey, you know, I will be back.

03:05:32.280 --> 03:05:35.960
I have a pass for Disneyland now, so I'll definitely be back.

03:05:35.960 --> 03:05:38.920
So I will definitely let you know.

03:05:38.920 --> 03:05:42.080
Maybe an OLR LA meetup, but Marissa, we're going to let you go so we can wrap up our

03:05:42.080 --> 03:05:43.080
show.

03:05:43.080 --> 03:05:44.080
Okay?

03:05:44.080 --> 03:05:45.080
Absolutely.

03:05:45.080 --> 03:05:46.080
And love to Jamie too.

03:05:46.080 --> 03:05:47.080
Come hang out with me.

03:05:47.080 --> 03:05:48.080
Yes.

03:05:48.080 --> 03:05:49.080
Come to Sacramento.

03:05:49.080 --> 03:05:50.080
Be on the show.

03:05:50.080 --> 03:05:51.080
Please make it happen.

03:05:51.080 --> 03:05:52.080
All right.

03:05:52.080 --> 03:05:53.080
Take care, buddy.

03:05:53.080 --> 03:05:54.080
All right.

03:05:54.080 --> 03:05:55.080
We're going to go ahead and, uh, have that beat.

03:05:55.080 --> 03:05:56.080
Last guy.

03:05:56.080 --> 03:05:57.960
I think all the people that were dying to get through that through, we want to wrap

03:05:57.960 --> 03:05:58.960
up.

03:05:58.960 --> 03:05:59.960
We're already like three hours and counting.

03:05:59.960 --> 03:06:00.960
We had a Marissa.

03:06:00.960 --> 03:06:01.960
I know.

03:06:01.960 --> 03:06:02.960
It was very nice to hear from her.

03:06:02.960 --> 03:06:05.840
Uh, Loki, did you have anything else you wanted to get out there before we wrap up tonight?

03:06:05.840 --> 03:06:10.800
Uh, Mel, your arcade is actually an arcade game apparently because I see images of the

03:06:10.800 --> 03:06:12.380
cabinet now.

03:06:12.380 --> 03:06:13.380
So that makes sense.

03:06:13.380 --> 03:06:15.000
Well, there is another Xbox live arcade game then.

03:06:15.000 --> 03:06:17.880
I don't know what it is.

03:06:17.880 --> 03:06:20.680
Um, let's see.

03:06:20.680 --> 03:06:28.160
Smash Brothers, um, brawl, the user online services ending, um, that not being the multiplayer

03:06:28.160 --> 03:06:33.560
online service, but the service to upload user-generated snapshots, stage designs and

03:06:33.560 --> 03:06:36.180
replay data will no longer be available.

03:06:36.180 --> 03:06:37.180
Why is that?

03:06:37.180 --> 03:06:38.180
That's kind of sad.

03:06:38.180 --> 03:06:39.700
No word.

03:06:39.700 --> 03:06:40.700
No word at all.

03:06:40.700 --> 03:06:41.700
Um, interesting.

03:06:41.700 --> 03:06:42.700
Yes.

03:06:42.700 --> 03:06:49.240
Something else interesting, Smash Brothers Brawl related, apparently there's a flaw or

03:06:49.240 --> 03:06:55.080
an exploit that's been discovered in the stage builder that will allow you to run, oh yes,

03:06:55.080 --> 03:06:57.960
you know it, arbitrary homebrew code.

03:06:57.960 --> 03:06:58.960
Yes.

03:06:58.960 --> 03:07:01.020
This is why it's getting closed.

03:07:01.020 --> 03:07:02.020
Here we go.

03:07:02.020 --> 03:07:10.880
Another, uh, another, um, exploit, just like a Twilight Princess.

03:07:10.880 --> 03:07:15.360
And then, um, let's see here.

03:07:15.360 --> 03:07:20.720
And apparently Sony says that E3 is not a proper venue to announce any PS3 price drops.

03:07:20.720 --> 03:07:25.040
Excuses, excuses.

03:07:25.040 --> 03:07:26.040
That's it.

03:07:26.040 --> 03:07:27.040
All right.

03:07:27.040 --> 03:07:28.040
I'm having a change of heart.

03:07:28.040 --> 03:07:32.320
I'm opening up the phone line one more time, so if we want to get a couple more calls in,

03:07:32.320 --> 03:07:36.080
we'll give it just a minute to see if anyone else calls, and we'll give it a, again, two

03:07:36.080 --> 03:07:37.400
minute rules in effect.

03:07:37.400 --> 03:07:42.720
One eight seven seven game O-L-R, or our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio, and then we're

03:07:42.720 --> 03:07:43.720
going to wrap up.

03:07:43.720 --> 03:07:45.560
I don't know if we're going to do much of an after birth tonight.

03:07:45.560 --> 03:07:50.800
I really want, I really want to get out of here by 10 o'clock tonight, so yeah, because

03:07:50.800 --> 03:07:51.800
I got to work at six tomorrow.

03:07:51.800 --> 03:07:53.320
We need a ten second window.

03:07:53.320 --> 03:07:54.320
Ten second window.

03:07:54.320 --> 03:07:55.320
No more done.

03:07:55.320 --> 03:07:57.360
I think everybody that really wanted to get through got through.

03:07:57.360 --> 03:07:58.360
Seven.

03:07:58.360 --> 03:07:59.360
Oh, we got another one.

03:07:59.360 --> 03:08:02.440
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio, who's this?

03:08:02.440 --> 03:08:03.440
Deathwishing.

03:08:03.440 --> 03:08:04.440
Death?

03:08:04.440 --> 03:08:05.440
Hello, Deathwishing.

03:08:05.440 --> 03:08:07.520
You have two minutes, go.

03:08:07.520 --> 03:08:10.960
Um, okay, first of all, everyone, get Fuel.

03:08:10.960 --> 03:08:14.400
It's like, for me, even if you're not going to like it, rent it, because it's just so

03:08:14.400 --> 03:08:15.400
massive.

03:08:15.400 --> 03:08:20.680
It's 5,000 square miles of just racing, and it's just, wow.

03:08:20.680 --> 03:08:21.680
Interesting.

03:08:21.680 --> 03:08:26.000
I've heard a lot of negative things about Fuel on the game review sites, but that's

03:08:26.000 --> 03:08:27.000
now two people.

03:08:27.000 --> 03:08:29.120
Yeah, like Edge and IGN, but those sites suck anyways.

03:08:29.120 --> 03:08:30.120
True enough.

03:08:30.120 --> 03:08:31.120
Okay, I'm sorry.

03:08:31.120 --> 03:08:32.120
Go ahead.

03:08:32.120 --> 03:08:33.120
Anyways, here we go with E3.

03:08:33.120 --> 03:08:34.120
Assassin's Creed 2.

03:08:34.120 --> 03:08:37.200
I'm going to show you, if I say, ugh, that means it's good, and if I go, oh, that means

03:08:37.200 --> 03:08:38.200
no.

03:08:38.200 --> 03:08:41.160
Assassin's Creed 2, yes.

03:08:41.160 --> 03:08:46.280
Splinter Cell Conviction, I shit my pants.

03:08:46.280 --> 03:08:53.640
Halo Reach, I'm actually excited because it's a Halo based on the book, Follow Reach,

03:08:53.640 --> 03:09:00.040
which is going to explain why there's Spartans and why there's only four.

03:09:00.040 --> 03:09:06.600
And I'm sorry, but the PS3 motion control looks like a sex toy.

03:09:06.600 --> 03:09:08.360
You say this like it's a problem.

03:09:08.360 --> 03:09:09.360
I think it is.

03:09:09.360 --> 03:09:11.160
It looks like a sex toy.

03:09:11.160 --> 03:09:12.160
Maybe it is.

03:09:12.160 --> 03:09:13.160
Oh.

03:09:13.160 --> 03:09:17.680
Why do we have a problem with this?

03:09:17.680 --> 03:09:20.960
It's going to give little kids ideas.

03:09:20.960 --> 03:09:24.120
Well that's just because their mommy and daddy didn't teach them right.

03:09:24.120 --> 03:09:29.040
It's just going to encourage people to put glowing balls on their penis and then try

03:09:29.040 --> 03:09:30.640
to get the thing to follow their penis.

03:09:30.640 --> 03:09:31.880
Hey, you know what, it's fine.

03:09:31.880 --> 03:09:32.880
It's fine.

03:09:32.880 --> 03:09:35.960
For boys, you can put the Wii Vitalize on your wiener.

03:09:35.960 --> 03:09:38.880
For the girls, you can put the PS3 motion control on your pussy.

03:09:38.880 --> 03:09:39.880
I'm not finished.

03:09:39.880 --> 03:09:40.880
Oh, sorry.

03:09:40.880 --> 03:09:45.380
Project Natal, I could, like, you know how with Rainbow Six Vegas, you could do the facial

03:09:45.380 --> 03:09:48.200
scan and put your face in the game?

03:09:48.200 --> 03:09:51.320
Now think of Project Natal putting your whole body in the game.

03:09:51.320 --> 03:09:57.920
Also, remember they showed that little tech demo with Peter Monono and that little child?

03:09:57.920 --> 03:10:00.120
Remember when he needed a drawing?

03:10:00.120 --> 03:10:01.120
Come on!

03:10:01.120 --> 03:10:02.840
Someone's going to put their penis on there!

03:10:02.840 --> 03:10:03.840
It's going to happen!

03:10:03.840 --> 03:10:05.160
Yeah, I know that.

03:10:05.160 --> 03:10:07.440
I can't wait to scan my new body.

03:10:07.440 --> 03:10:11.040
When you use that in a game, a first person shooter, what's going to happen to the fat

03:10:11.040 --> 03:10:12.040
guy?

03:10:12.040 --> 03:10:13.040
He's going to have a bigger hitbox.

03:10:13.040 --> 03:10:17.040
Alright, quickly, because we talked over your call, I'll give you fifteen more seconds to

03:10:17.040 --> 03:10:21.040
wrap it up.

03:10:21.040 --> 03:10:23.820
I've been playing one versus one hundred and you need to join in, Rob.

03:10:23.820 --> 03:10:27.080
This is like Tuesday during, I think they're having another live episode, the twelfth,

03:10:27.080 --> 03:10:28.400
and I would join in if I were you.

03:10:28.400 --> 03:10:29.400
I will try to play.

03:10:29.400 --> 03:10:30.400
I will do my best.

03:10:30.400 --> 03:10:31.400
Alright, we've got to let you go.

03:10:31.400 --> 03:10:32.400
Have fun.

03:10:32.400 --> 03:10:33.400
Bye!

03:10:33.400 --> 03:10:34.400
Bye!

03:10:34.400 --> 03:10:39.600
I liked his whole uh and buh scale that he didn't even really use.

03:10:39.600 --> 03:10:44.160
It was fascinating.

03:10:44.160 --> 03:10:48.580
Marissa asked in chat, what is it with guys inputting their penis everywhere and Frisbee

03:10:48.580 --> 03:10:52.620
has the right answer because they can.

03:10:52.620 --> 03:10:54.440
We talked about this a little earlier in the show.

03:10:54.440 --> 03:11:00.200
I don't, I don't do it but I just report it how I see it and history has proven itself.

03:11:00.200 --> 03:11:04.320
If it can have a penis put in on it, a penis will be put on it.

03:11:04.320 --> 03:11:07.800
Folks, we do not make the news, we merely report on it.

03:11:07.800 --> 03:11:09.000
The cock always wins, huh?

03:11:09.000 --> 03:11:11.760
Alright, on that thought, we've got to go around and give everybody's final thoughts.

03:11:11.760 --> 03:11:12.840
We're on out of here for tonight.

03:11:12.840 --> 03:11:15.320
Loki, any final thoughts?

03:11:15.320 --> 03:11:18.300
I'm glad to be back, I'm tired.

03:11:18.300 --> 03:11:21.200
My final thought is, sleep is awesome.

03:11:21.200 --> 03:11:23.240
Dark Soccer, do you have any final thoughts?

03:11:23.240 --> 03:11:26.480
My husband didn't bring me a milkshake, I'm disappointed.

03:11:26.480 --> 03:11:28.280
He's so fired for that.

03:11:28.280 --> 03:11:32.080
Alright, thank you guys so much for tuning into and downloading our show, we really appreciate

03:11:32.080 --> 03:11:33.080
it.

03:11:33.080 --> 03:11:36.400
Thank you for supporting Independent Podcasting, you guys are amazing and thank you for staying

03:11:36.400 --> 03:11:40.760
up late with us tonight and putting up with our crap if you're listening to it on the

03:11:40.760 --> 03:11:42.880
podcast feed, getting all the way here to the end.

03:11:42.880 --> 03:11:44.340
Really appreciate it.

03:11:44.340 --> 03:11:47.640
Thank you guys again so much, if you like what you hear, please tell two friends about

03:11:47.640 --> 03:11:49.920
our show, word of mouth is how we sell it.

03:11:49.920 --> 03:11:53.760
Thank you guys so much, have a wonderful night, we will see you next week with more gaming

03:11:53.760 --> 03:11:54.760
news.

03:11:54.760 --> 03:11:57.480
Hey, just because E3's over doesn't mean the video game news is stopping, we'll be back

03:11:57.480 --> 03:11:59.280
next week.

03:11:59.280 --> 03:12:02.160
Maybe since we'll probably have a lull in the news next week since everybody shot their

03:12:02.160 --> 03:12:06.780
wad this week, maybe next week we'll be able to play some good old fashioned OLR games.

03:12:06.780 --> 03:12:08.120
So look forward to that next week.

03:12:08.120 --> 03:12:10.040
I think that sounds like a stupendous idea.

03:12:10.040 --> 03:12:14.320
Alright then, stay tuned to next week in another stupendous show.

03:12:14.320 --> 03:12:18.680
In the meantime, I am the stupendous Rob Roberts, that's the amazing Jamie Summers and he's

03:12:18.680 --> 03:12:22.720
the OK Loki, and we'll see you next week here on Orange Lounge Radio.
