1
00:00:15,045 --> 00:00:21,595
[SPEAKER_05]: 28, 2009.

2
00:00:15,505 --> 00:00:21,595
[SPEAKER_05]: We kick back and celebrate seven years of Orange Lounge Radio with all of our listeners.

3
00:00:31,827 --> 00:00:36,468
[SPEAKER_16]: Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

4
00:00:36,548 --> 00:00:40,369
[SPEAKER_16]: We are that video game talk show dedicated, of course, to video games.

5
00:00:40,809 --> 00:00:43,449
[SPEAKER_16]: Video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.

6
00:00:43,469 --> 00:00:46,670
[SPEAKER_16]: We like to say it's the place where every gamer has a voice.

7
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:52,091
[SPEAKER_16]: But it's going to be these three voices walking you through the next few hours here when we tape live on All Games Radio.

8
00:00:52,511 --> 00:00:57,672
[SPEAKER_16]: Myself, Rob Roberts, and the one and only Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers, here as well.

9
00:00:58,332 --> 00:00:58,712
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi.

10
00:00:58,932 --> 00:00:59,252
[SPEAKER_16]: How are you?

11
00:01:00,342 --> 00:01:01,543
[SPEAKER_16]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

12
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:25,300
[SPEAKER_16]: Hello.

13
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:26,100
[SPEAKER_16]: How you doing, Loki?

14
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:26,420
[SPEAKER_16]: Good.

15
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:27,561
[SPEAKER_16]: Stay indoors today?

16
00:01:28,501 --> 00:01:29,881
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, I painted baseboards.

17
00:01:30,221 --> 00:01:30,581
[SPEAKER_16]: Fun.

18
00:01:31,381 --> 00:01:32,862
[SPEAKER_16]: Being a homeowner rocks, doesn't it?

19
00:01:32,962 --> 00:01:33,522
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.

20
00:01:34,502 --> 00:01:34,882
[SPEAKER_16]: Awesome.

21
00:01:35,142 --> 00:01:40,403
[SPEAKER_16]: And then I remember you said something about not being able to get stories for the show tonight.

22
00:01:40,523 --> 00:01:45,864
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, because the internet was down because Comcast was working on improving their network in our neighborhood.

23
00:01:45,884 --> 00:01:47,065
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know what that exactly means.

24
00:01:47,245 --> 00:01:48,725
[SPEAKER_13]: So your house is just broken right now.

25
00:01:50,185 --> 00:01:50,806
[SPEAKER_16]: Today at least.

26
00:01:50,986 --> 00:01:51,406
[SPEAKER_16]: That's right.

27
00:01:51,946 --> 00:01:52,967
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, hey, guys.

28
00:01:53,027 --> 00:01:56,409
[SPEAKER_16]: It is the seventh year anniversary of Orange Laundry, believe it or not.

29
00:01:56,449 --> 00:01:59,991
[SPEAKER_16]: We've been talking about it for a couple weeks now, kind of hyping it up a little bit.

30
00:02:00,611 --> 00:02:02,653
[SPEAKER_16]: And sure enough, we started this little program.

31
00:02:02,673 --> 00:02:04,113
[SPEAKER_16]: The very first episode was June 23rd.

32
00:02:05,274 --> 00:02:06,035
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you for watching!

33
00:02:27,239 --> 00:02:32,386
[SPEAKER_16]: We can take a minute to say thanks to all of you for helping make it happen.

34
00:02:32,426 --> 00:02:37,714
[SPEAKER_16]: Because I'll tell you what, that very first show, the very first night, episode number one, we had 12 people listening.

35
00:02:38,194 --> 00:02:42,701
[SPEAKER_16]: And now on allgames.com, when we tape live, we get as many as 13.

36
00:02:43,522 --> 00:02:59,403
[SPEAKER_16]: so we've really grown no I'm just kidding obviously we have a little more than that but it's just been great you guys really have taken that to heart what we say at the end of every show to just tell more people about our show and it's worked and we've grown a little bit so thank you guys so much for helping us reach 7 years of Orange Lounge Radio

37
00:02:59,844 --> 00:03:00,725
[SPEAKER_16]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

38
00:03:17,382 --> 00:03:21,263
[SPEAKER_16]: We had three hours to talk all about E3 and what happened there.

39
00:03:21,584 --> 00:03:23,024
[SPEAKER_16]: Tonight, not so much.

40
00:03:23,484 --> 00:03:25,965
[SPEAKER_16]: So we're going to just do it the old-fashioned way.

41
00:03:25,985 --> 00:03:28,166
[SPEAKER_16]: Because this is the way we did the show for many, many years.

42
00:03:28,546 --> 00:03:30,087
[SPEAKER_16]: So we're going to see if we've still got it in us.

43
00:03:30,647 --> 00:03:33,268
[SPEAKER_16]: And we're just going to wing it, folks, here on Orange Laundry.

44
00:03:33,288 --> 00:03:34,228
[SPEAKER_16]: We're just going to wing it tonight.

45
00:03:34,784 --> 00:03:37,985
[SPEAKER_07]: We've started assigning positions as if Orange Lounge was a starship.

46
00:03:38,245 --> 00:03:39,485
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes, and what's your position?

47
00:03:39,545 --> 00:03:39,925
[SPEAKER_07]: Captain.

48
00:03:41,085 --> 00:03:41,865
[SPEAKER_16]: What's my position?

49
00:03:42,005 --> 00:03:45,066
[SPEAKER_07]: First officer, because you have to talk to everybody and be my voice.

50
00:03:45,206 --> 00:03:46,226
[SPEAKER_16]: What would be Loki's position?

51
00:03:46,786 --> 00:03:47,087
[SPEAKER_07]: Worf.

52
00:03:48,767 --> 00:03:52,868
[SPEAKER_07]: We've given Loki's security officer position because he's the most aggressive of us all.

53
00:03:53,048 --> 00:03:53,308
[SPEAKER_16]: I see.

54
00:03:53,708 --> 00:03:55,928
[SPEAKER_07]: And Jason is our ship's engineer.

55
00:03:56,688 --> 00:03:58,809
[SPEAKER_16]: We decided that... Big man kind of does that too, though, now.

56
00:03:59,629 --> 00:04:04,430
[SPEAKER_16]: Jason would be like the engineer, Deakman's kind of the person that would actually... Science officer?

57
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:04,871
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

58
00:04:05,151 --> 00:04:06,011
[SPEAKER_07]: He can be our science officer.

59
00:04:06,131 --> 00:04:06,531
[SPEAKER_16]: Like data?

60
00:04:06,691 --> 00:04:06,911
[SPEAKER_16]: Data?

61
00:04:07,071 --> 00:04:07,731
[SPEAKER_16]: Data, yeah.

62
00:04:08,371 --> 00:04:15,113
[SPEAKER_07]: And then that means that, because I was going to say that Tiara was our science officer, but I'm going to make her... Sulu.

63
00:04:15,933 --> 00:04:16,594
[SPEAKER_07]: She's our Sulu.

64
00:04:17,754 --> 00:04:18,594
[SPEAKER_07]: She can be our Sulu.

65
00:04:19,294 --> 00:04:19,834
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh my.

66
00:04:20,235 --> 00:04:21,475
[SPEAKER_07]: No, Deakman can be our Uhura.

67
00:04:23,584 --> 00:04:26,386
[SPEAKER_07]: Because he does so much communication stuff for us.

68
00:04:26,706 --> 00:04:27,866
[SPEAKER_07]: He's our communications officer.

69
00:04:28,387 --> 00:04:29,908
[SPEAKER_07]: So Sauce can be our science officer.

70
00:04:30,188 --> 00:04:30,408
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

71
00:04:31,188 --> 00:04:33,189
[SPEAKER_07]: And then our Sulu is Misty.

72
00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:34,110
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

73
00:04:34,590 --> 00:04:35,391
[SPEAKER_07]: Because she can drive us.

74
00:04:35,571 --> 00:04:37,312
[SPEAKER_16]: Now, is there a farting officer?

75
00:04:37,372 --> 00:04:38,952
[SPEAKER_16]: Because we need Rice Princess to have a role.

76
00:04:39,193 --> 00:04:40,293
[SPEAKER_07]: Chris is ship's lesbian.

77
00:04:42,534 --> 00:04:43,455
[SPEAKER_16]: Official ship's lesbian.

78
00:04:43,615 --> 00:04:43,915
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

79
00:04:44,155 --> 00:04:45,736
[SPEAKER_16]: Wouldn't she be the Troy?

80
00:04:46,216 --> 00:04:47,697
[SPEAKER_07]: Rice Princess can be our Chekhov.

81
00:04:48,238 --> 00:04:48,438
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

82
00:04:48,478 --> 00:04:49,418
[SPEAKER_07]: So she can scream at people.

83
00:04:49,598 --> 00:04:49,879
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

84
00:04:49,899 --> 00:04:50,739
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

85
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:56,021
[SPEAKER_07]: and do our advanced calculations and stuff.

86
00:04:56,141 --> 00:04:57,301
[SPEAKER_07]: But we need a ship's counselor.

87
00:04:57,422 --> 00:05:00,502
[SPEAKER_16]: Now everybody in chat is screaming, you know, who's going to be Quark?

88
00:05:00,822 --> 00:05:01,823
[SPEAKER_16]: Who's going to be Scotty?

89
00:05:01,963 --> 00:05:02,883
[SPEAKER_16]: Who's the doctor?

90
00:05:04,163 --> 00:05:05,023
[SPEAKER_07]: This isn't DS9.

91
00:05:05,123 --> 00:05:05,964
[SPEAKER_16]: Hello?

92
00:05:06,004 --> 00:05:06,804
[SPEAKER_16]: We don't have Quark.

93
00:05:06,964 --> 00:05:08,624
[SPEAKER_16]: We have somebody called the doctor already.

94
00:05:09,084 --> 00:05:11,285
[SPEAKER_16]: So the doctor would be the doctor, silly.

95
00:05:11,305 --> 00:05:12,945
[SPEAKER_07]: Ship's doctor will be Shermie.

96
00:05:15,126 --> 00:05:15,366
[SPEAKER_16]: All right.

97
00:05:15,926 --> 00:05:16,346
[SPEAKER_16]: Meow, meow.

98
00:05:17,046 --> 00:05:17,286
[SPEAKER_16]: All right.

99
00:05:17,807 --> 00:05:19,087
[SPEAKER_07]: She's ship's cat.

100
00:05:19,949 --> 00:05:25,150
[SPEAKER_16]: Let's do what we used to do here on the show, and instead of talking just about games... Ooh, Patty and Sulu!

101
00:05:25,671 --> 00:05:27,971
[SPEAKER_16]: Get away from the damn Star Trek for a minute.

102
00:05:29,272 --> 00:05:31,292
[SPEAKER_16]: There's some folks that don't even like Trek listening to the show.

103
00:05:31,312 --> 00:05:33,153
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, Game Guru said that Loki's our red shirt.

104
00:05:33,453 --> 00:05:35,633
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, if you want to... That's not very nice.

105
00:05:35,914 --> 00:05:41,555
[SPEAKER_16]: If you want to join the chat room and scream Star Trek obscenities with the rest of our chat, chat.orangeloungeradio.com is the place to be.

106
00:05:41,575 --> 00:05:42,615
[SPEAKER_16]: Ranma's our ship's counselor.

107
00:05:43,056 --> 00:05:47,937
[SPEAKER_16]: When we tape live on Sunday nights at All Games Radio at 6 o'clock Pacific Standard Time...

108
00:05:48,337 --> 00:05:49,938
[SPEAKER_16]: DarkSakura, how was your day, how was your week?

109
00:06:11,334 --> 00:06:11,494
[SPEAKER_07]: Awe!

110
00:06:32,984 --> 00:06:33,745
[SPEAKER_07]: with disability pay.

111
00:06:36,088 --> 00:06:38,851
[SPEAKER_07]: But no, really, I've needed my finger surgery done.

112
00:06:38,871 --> 00:06:40,273
[SPEAKER_07]: I was supposed to have it done at the end of July.

113
00:06:40,293 --> 00:06:41,234
[SPEAKER_07]: She's going on the dole.

114
00:06:42,876 --> 00:06:48,883
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, someone canceled, and so I was able to get it done tomorrow, and that is such a blessing.

115
00:06:49,423 --> 00:06:50,385
[SPEAKER_16]: Surgery's important, though.

116
00:06:50,976 --> 00:07:07,125
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it's a 30 minute procedure, I'm going to be awake through the whole thing Oh my gosh But I won't feel, they won't let me watch, bastards So, anyway, as it's going, I've kind of, it sort of really hit me kind of hard this morning So I've been kind of pissy

117
00:07:07,905 --> 00:07:13,910
[SPEAKER_07]: Try not to be pissy, I've tried to stay in a good mood, but unfortunately when you're pissy, there's not a lot to keep you from just being pissy, you know?

118
00:07:14,630 --> 00:07:22,216
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm supposed to go to a birthday party today, because Julie's birthday was Thursday, and yours was Friday, so happy birthday.

119
00:07:22,236 --> 00:07:22,957
[SPEAKER_16]: Indeed it was, thank you.

120
00:07:23,257 --> 00:07:24,097
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry I couldn't make it.

121
00:07:24,318 --> 00:07:25,739
[SPEAKER_16]: That's okay, I didn't have a lot of stuff.

122
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:26,239
[SPEAKER_07]: I called you.

123
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:32,644
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, you did, and we've got plans later this week, and you need to meet the BF and all that fun stuff, so we'll take care of that later this week.

124
00:07:32,864 --> 00:07:34,805
[SPEAKER_07]: Indian food while I'm high is a kite, that should be funny.

125
00:07:35,826 --> 00:07:37,968
[SPEAKER_16]: I do not have to learn to play with myself with my other hand.

126
00:07:54,744 --> 00:07:55,905
[SPEAKER_07]: That's why God made toys.

127
00:07:56,105 --> 00:08:02,069
[SPEAKER_16]: Those are the kinds of things that DJ Morpheus will throw out there on Saturday nights right here on All Games Radio where he tapes his show now.

128
00:08:02,569 --> 00:08:06,051
[SPEAKER_16]: I do want to also point out he did say, hope they cut open the right body part.

129
00:08:06,771 --> 00:08:10,674
[SPEAKER_16]: Because that would kind of suck to go in there and then suddenly you come out of there and you have bigger boobs.

130
00:08:11,614 --> 00:08:13,975
[SPEAKER_07]: They could cut open the wrong body part and take out part of it.

131
00:08:13,995 --> 00:08:14,516
[SPEAKER_07]: That would be happy.

132
00:08:15,816 --> 00:08:16,077
[SPEAKER_16]: Alright.

133
00:08:16,857 --> 00:08:19,779
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, as far as my week?

134
00:08:20,399 --> 00:08:20,599
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

135
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:21,660
[SPEAKER_07]: Um...

136
00:08:22,918 --> 00:08:25,502
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

137
00:08:33,393 --> 00:08:42,537
[SPEAKER_16]: Tell us a little bit about the condition, because I think you haven't talked a lot about playing games yourself on the show in probably the past six months.

138
00:08:42,897 --> 00:08:47,218
[SPEAKER_16]: Granted, you've had some on the DS and stuff, but I think people don't understand that you have something up with your hand.

139
00:08:47,639 --> 00:08:50,020
[SPEAKER_16]: You can't really do the controllers for very long.

140
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:57,883
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll tell you what hurts most about playing a game is... And by the way, I agree with Travis.

141
00:08:57,903 --> 00:08:58,483
[SPEAKER_07]: He is our cue.

142
00:09:00,111 --> 00:09:01,912
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for watching!

143
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:36,481
[SPEAKER_07]: and those muscles of course are in your forearm and the tendons run from your forearm to your finger and it's my middle two fingers of my right hand my flipping off everybody because they suck finger and my not getting married finger which is the other hand so it's on my right hand

144
00:09:37,265 --> 00:09:45,687
[SPEAKER_07]: So anyway, the tendons that when they attach to the muscles in your fingers, there's a sheath around them of tissue.

145
00:09:46,408 --> 00:09:54,350
[SPEAKER_07]: Something that kind of holds them in place so that they don't bow out, you know, like when you have a bow strung too tightly and the things start popping out.

146
00:09:54,910 --> 00:10:11,979
[SPEAKER_07]: and it keeps the tendons in place and what happened is I have swelling on my hand if you look at your palm up above the center of your palm where the the really fleshy part is right under your fingers I have a knot on each tendon and what happens is that if you imagine like a pulley

147
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:13,741
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura.com

148
00:10:30,781 --> 00:10:32,922
[SPEAKER_16]: Actdeft in our chatroom says, Flexor tendonitis.

149
00:10:32,962 --> 00:10:33,803
[SPEAKER_16]: It sounds like a DJ.

150
00:10:34,563 --> 00:10:35,083
[SPEAKER_16]: A little bit.

151
00:10:35,523 --> 00:10:38,905
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, that's really, I think, the best way I can describe it.

152
00:10:38,945 --> 00:10:42,566
[SPEAKER_07]: So what they're going to do is actually cut my hand open.

153
00:10:43,067 --> 00:10:47,549
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's just like they open two little flaps on either side.

154
00:10:48,149 --> 00:10:52,131
[SPEAKER_07]: And they're going to snip the tendon sheath so that that lump...

155
00:10:52,771 --> 00:10:52,991
[SPEAKER_07]: DJ Flexer

156
00:11:12,916 --> 00:11:15,317
[SPEAKER_13]: So they're circumcising your hand?

157
00:11:15,537 --> 00:11:17,618
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I'm not having skin removed from it.

158
00:11:17,738 --> 00:11:18,998
[SPEAKER_07]: They're just making a little cut.

159
00:11:20,659 --> 00:11:31,482
[SPEAKER_07]: But the whole problem as far as how it hurts is that now it's to the point that even when my fingers are straightened out, if I try to bend them, that lump, it's just so much swelling in my fingers.

160
00:11:31,502 --> 00:11:32,943
[SPEAKER_07]: Because you can actually see it on my palm.

161
00:11:33,103 --> 00:11:33,743
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I'm showing Rob.

162
00:11:34,843 --> 00:11:35,324
[SPEAKER_16]: Great radio.

163
00:11:37,425 --> 00:11:39,927
[SPEAKER_07]: It's visible on my palm now.

164
00:11:41,268 --> 00:11:42,149
[SPEAKER_07]: It hurts a lot, actually.

165
00:11:42,189 --> 00:11:42,810
[SPEAKER_07]: It's really sore.

166
00:11:43,810 --> 00:11:46,793
[SPEAKER_16]: You know what they say about folks with swelled palms?

167
00:11:47,974 --> 00:11:48,374
[SPEAKER_07]: They hurt?

168
00:11:48,694 --> 00:11:49,075
[SPEAKER_16]: Never mind.

169
00:11:50,796 --> 00:11:51,957
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, wait, that's hairy palms.

170
00:11:51,977 --> 00:11:55,079
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what they say about men with big feet?

171
00:11:55,980 --> 00:11:56,440
[SPEAKER_16]: Big socks?

172
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:56,901
[SPEAKER_07]: Big shoes.

173
00:11:57,936 --> 00:12:06,786
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, but, um, now, holding a controller, now me telling everyone right exactly where the, where the owies are.

174
00:12:07,687 --> 00:12:14,634
[SPEAKER_07]: Imagine having a piece of hard plastic shoved against swollen tendon tissue for, oh, longer than ten minutes.

175
00:12:15,815 --> 00:12:17,876
[SPEAKER_07]: Imagine not being able to bend your middle two fingers.

176
00:12:17,976 --> 00:12:18,996
[SPEAKER_07]: It hurts to hold a fork.

177
00:12:19,156 --> 00:12:23,058
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't hold, you know, I do graphic art and everything.

178
00:12:23,118 --> 00:12:30,401
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't hold my stylus or a pen that isn't like a big child-sized fat highlighter or smelly markers for longer than 10 minutes.

179
00:12:31,161 --> 00:12:32,781
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's really getting in the way of my life.

180
00:12:32,862 --> 00:12:35,483
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm just going to say cortisone.

181
00:12:35,563 --> 00:12:38,063
[SPEAKER_07]: I've had two rounds of cortisone, two shots in each finger.

182
00:12:39,224 --> 00:12:39,524
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm done.

183
00:12:39,844 --> 00:12:41,945
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm ready just to have the surgery done and get it over with.

184
00:12:43,766 --> 00:12:45,968
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, this is like real trauma in the ER type of thing.

185
00:12:45,988 --> 00:12:47,249
[SPEAKER_16]: Although it's not really an emergency.

186
00:12:47,289 --> 00:12:47,829
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not bad.

187
00:12:48,209 --> 00:12:49,530
[SPEAKER_16]: It's not a big procedure.

188
00:12:49,630 --> 00:12:51,512
[SPEAKER_16]: It sounds a lot like what my mom had a couple years ago.

189
00:12:51,532 --> 00:12:55,174
[SPEAKER_16]: She had her shoulder operated on and her shoulder was preventing her from painting.

190
00:12:55,514 --> 00:12:59,317
[SPEAKER_16]: And I know that was really rough on her because she's older.

191
00:12:59,397 --> 00:13:01,379
[SPEAKER_16]: She's past 65 at this point.

192
00:13:01,439 --> 00:13:05,021
[SPEAKER_16]: She's long retired from being a preschool teacher and nanny, the stuff she did.

193
00:13:05,402 --> 00:13:06,142
[SPEAKER_16]: She likes to paint.

194
00:13:06,202 --> 00:13:07,423
[SPEAKER_16]: That's how she passes the time.

195
00:13:07,483 --> 00:13:09,665
[SPEAKER_16]: So having to have that surgery was rough for her.

196
00:13:09,705 --> 00:13:11,406
[SPEAKER_16]: But now she can paint again and she's really happy.

197
00:13:11,466 --> 00:13:12,907
[SPEAKER_16]: So soon you'll be able to play games again and

198
00:13:12,947 --> 00:13:13,307
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura.com

199
00:13:32,694 --> 00:13:33,014
[SPEAKER_16]: Project Natal

200
00:13:56,369 --> 00:13:57,530
[SPEAKER_07]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

201
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:44,044
[SPEAKER_07]: it was it was just like I would just sit and just sketch you know for stress relief couldn't do it I can't massage people except but with my left hand which fortunately enough my primary clients all of her problems are on her left side so that's fine but you know it's just it's it's gonna be an adjustment but I'm absolutely relieved well now were you able to get into any gaming at all

202
00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:45,501
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

203
00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:10,782
[SPEAKER_16]: Is that actually a skill in The Sims?

204
00:15:10,802 --> 00:15:12,163
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, it's one of the hidden skills.

205
00:15:12,423 --> 00:15:15,447
[SPEAKER_07]: You can just start playing video games and you can get up to level 10 master video games.

206
00:15:15,467 --> 00:15:17,249
[SPEAKER_16]: What happens if you max out your video gaming skill?

207
00:15:17,289 --> 00:15:20,292
[SPEAKER_16]: Do you become like Fatality and you get your own line of video cards and stuff?

208
00:15:20,373 --> 00:15:21,974
[SPEAKER_16]: No, you just are awesome.

209
00:15:22,835 --> 00:15:27,100
[SPEAKER_07]: But Simmy is a professional writer and a hacker.

210
00:15:28,742 --> 00:15:29,203
[SPEAKER_07]: Just because.

211
00:15:30,644 --> 00:15:31,025
[SPEAKER_16]: All right.

212
00:15:31,425 --> 00:15:33,847
[SPEAKER_16]: Well... Oh, and I played Peggle.

213
00:15:33,987 --> 00:15:35,328
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm glad to see Sims is going fun.

214
00:15:35,469 --> 00:15:35,729
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah?

215
00:15:36,029 --> 00:15:36,409
[SPEAKER_16]: I played Peggle.

216
00:15:36,429 --> 00:15:37,050
[SPEAKER_07]: Peggle on the iPhone?

217
00:15:37,390 --> 00:15:38,151
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep, on iPhone.

218
00:15:38,391 --> 00:15:38,591
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah?

219
00:15:39,052 --> 00:15:40,053
[SPEAKER_07]: I loves me some Peggle.

220
00:15:40,073 --> 00:15:41,094
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm glad they did that sale.

221
00:15:41,454 --> 00:15:42,375
[SPEAKER_16]: That motivated me to buy it.

222
00:15:42,955 --> 00:15:48,981
[SPEAKER_07]: And for people who are using Linux, there actually is a pretty good version of Breakout on Linux.

223
00:15:50,102 --> 00:15:52,484
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm running Linux Mint on my laptop.

224
00:15:53,184 --> 00:16:01,690
[SPEAKER_07]: And I like it that instead of using the arrow buttons to move your little bar around, you actually use the touchpad.

225
00:16:02,971 --> 00:16:09,356
[SPEAKER_07]: It recognizes the touchpad and you can slide your finger back and forth to move your little bounce bar.

226
00:16:10,056 --> 00:16:10,817
[SPEAKER_07]: So that was pretty fun.

227
00:16:11,657 --> 00:16:18,662
[SPEAKER_07]: I played, I was at Boston Market and I was playing Breakout over Chicken at Boston Market.

228
00:16:19,683 --> 00:16:20,724
[SPEAKER_16]: Nice, Chicken and Breakout.

229
00:16:20,984 --> 00:16:21,204
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep.

230
00:16:21,564 --> 00:16:21,844
[SPEAKER_16]: Awesome.

231
00:16:22,225 --> 00:16:22,645
[SPEAKER_07]: I am done.

232
00:16:22,950 --> 00:16:23,770
[SPEAKER_16]: Loki, how was your day?

233
00:16:23,790 --> 00:16:24,251
[SPEAKER_13]: How was your week?

234
00:16:48,268 --> 00:16:53,393
[SPEAKER_13]: I was trying to perfect the perfect modifications to Grand Theft Auto 4.

235
00:16:53,853 --> 00:16:55,655
[SPEAKER_13]: And we have a working set now.

236
00:16:55,755 --> 00:16:57,016
[SPEAKER_13]: It's absolute chaos.

237
00:16:57,417 --> 00:17:02,041
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, there's explosions going off everywhere consistently.

238
00:17:03,342 --> 00:17:05,725
[SPEAKER_13]: Basically, we replaced a bunch of the weapons in the game.

239
00:17:06,365 --> 00:17:12,711
[SPEAKER_13]: Starting with the Desert Eagle now is a gun that shoots these little vortex...

240
00:17:14,617 --> 00:17:32,994
[SPEAKER_13]: I guess they basically throw people into the air or cars or just whatever you fire it at and um so that was basically the first thing I created which was like a defensive weapon and it works pretty good and then we replaced the um the Mac 11 with uh

241
00:17:34,409 --> 00:17:41,374
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a Molotov launcher that fires lots of fire at people and catches them on fire and cars on fire and you name it.

242
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:48,379
[SPEAKER_13]: Then the MP5 which is the other Uzi in the game now fires rapid fire grenades and

243
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:50,301
[SPEAKER_13]: and DarkSakura

244
00:18:04,837 --> 00:18:05,958
[SPEAKER_16]: Real quick question from chat.

245
00:18:05,998 --> 00:18:06,498
[SPEAKER_16]: Let me ask this.

246
00:18:06,678 --> 00:18:09,100
[SPEAKER_16]: Chat.OrangeLoungeRadio.com live on this Sunday evening.

247
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:12,182
[SPEAKER_16]: Loki, is there any way we can download your mods?

248
00:18:12,222 --> 00:18:13,382
[SPEAKER_16]: That's from SSJ100, Matt.

249
00:18:13,963 --> 00:18:14,183
[SPEAKER_13]: No.

250
00:18:14,403 --> 00:18:16,804
[SPEAKER_13]: I'd have to post a copy of the ISO on there.

251
00:18:16,844 --> 00:18:19,326
[SPEAKER_13]: I guess I could post a copy of my modified files.

252
00:18:19,686 --> 00:18:21,727
[SPEAKER_13]: Then you just have to do the modifications yourself.

253
00:18:22,027 --> 00:18:26,790
[SPEAKER_13]: And then you'd have to build your own ISO and then burn it off and then play it on a modded 360.

254
00:18:26,830 --> 00:18:27,230
[SPEAKER_13]: But...

255
00:18:30,151 --> 00:18:32,373
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, I could do that, but it's a lot of work.

256
00:18:33,374 --> 00:18:35,056
[SPEAKER_13]: And then, let's see, what else did I do?

257
00:18:35,176 --> 00:18:40,982
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, the M4 now fires a bunch of rockets, which is kind of funny.

258
00:18:41,302 --> 00:18:47,188
[SPEAKER_13]: But they don't exactly explode on impact, they just bounce around a lot, which is kind of funny.

259
00:18:47,509 --> 00:18:50,992
[SPEAKER_13]: And then, let's see what else...

260
00:18:52,484 --> 00:18:54,186
[SPEAKER_13]: I think that's pretty much it as far as weapons go.

261
00:18:54,586 --> 00:19:08,797
[SPEAKER_13]: It's just a lot of chaos, and then also the police car flies, and the bus and the big vehicles basically are pretty dense, and they'll crash through anything and go really fast.

262
00:19:08,897 --> 00:19:10,479
[SPEAKER_13]: It's really mixing up the game.

263
00:19:10,939 --> 00:19:19,186
[SPEAKER_13]: Right now, because we've been playing Grand Theft Auto 4 since it's come out, and hell, we've been playing Grand Theft Auto games since they've come out on the PSP, and they had multiplayer in them.

264
00:19:19,746 --> 00:19:20,126
[SPEAKER_13]: So...

265
00:19:22,048 --> 00:19:24,671
[SPEAKER_13]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

266
00:19:39,767 --> 00:19:40,408
[SPEAKER_13]: Thanks for watching!

267
00:20:07,851 --> 00:20:13,918
[SPEAKER_13]: So beyond all that stuff, I've been just kind of unpacking and...

268
00:20:15,788 --> 00:20:16,108
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know.

269
00:20:38,715 --> 00:20:39,015
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know.

270
00:20:39,276 --> 00:20:40,137
[SPEAKER_16]: It's all in Japanese.

271
00:20:59,298 --> 00:21:07,005
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, I mean, I think with Wii Sports, it's more a lot of people have a curiosity about Wii Sports than are actually looking forward to it, have it pre-ordered.

272
00:21:07,085 --> 00:21:07,406
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know.

273
00:21:07,726 --> 00:21:12,070
[SPEAKER_16]: I get the feeling our listener base is more curious about it before they're going to plop down that kind of money.

274
00:21:13,512 --> 00:21:14,112
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a good deal.

275
00:21:14,152 --> 00:21:19,137
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, the game's going to be pretty decent, and it's got 12 sports in it, plus you get Wii Motion Plus.

276
00:21:19,177 --> 00:21:22,340
[SPEAKER_13]: So, I mean, hey, if the game sucks, at least you have Wii Motion Plus.

277
00:21:23,496 --> 00:21:42,077
[SPEAKER_13]: and you know as much I had to buy my Wii Motion Pluses at GameStop just because that's where I ended up turning in my games so I had a lot of credit and it was just games that I've had for a while or gotten free from work like really I'm not going to play UFC or you know I don't really give a crap about the Wheelman so wait so the Wii Motion Plus is already out

278
00:21:42,837 --> 00:21:43,858
[SPEAKER_13]: WeMotionPlus is already out.

279
00:22:11,836 --> 00:22:17,000
[SPEAKER_13]: No, but you can actually play frisbee golf and stuff in Tiger Woods 2010.

280
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:18,461
[SPEAKER_13]: So that's kind of cool.

281
00:22:18,641 --> 00:22:24,365
[SPEAKER_13]: And then... Yeah, but anyway, so I bought mine at GameStop.

282
00:22:24,425 --> 00:22:30,169
[SPEAKER_13]: And if you aren't using trading credit or happen to be getting free games that are really old and crappy...

283
00:22:32,017 --> 00:22:34,758
[SPEAKER_13]: You're just basically in pay with cash or something like that.

284
00:22:34,838 --> 00:22:37,699
[SPEAKER_13]: Don't go to GameStop because they're charging $5 over retail.

285
00:22:38,119 --> 00:22:40,199
[SPEAKER_13]: They're charging $25 for the Wii Motion Pluses.

286
00:22:40,259 --> 00:22:41,240
[SPEAKER_13]: They retail at $20.

287
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:42,440
[SPEAKER_13]: They know it.

288
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:44,400
[SPEAKER_13]: They just figure people are dumb and going to buy it.

289
00:22:44,540 --> 00:22:45,841
[SPEAKER_13]: And yes, I was dumb and bought it.

290
00:22:46,141 --> 00:22:51,802
[SPEAKER_13]: But the only reason I bought it there is because it actually didn't really cost me anything since I traded in games I got for free.

291
00:22:51,862 --> 00:22:53,623
[SPEAKER_13]: So who cares?

292
00:22:54,243 --> 00:22:56,964
[SPEAKER_13]: Really, I could have gone to GameCrazy or something like that.

293
00:22:58,064 --> 00:23:03,349
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm just not going to drive the extra distance to go someplace else other than GameStop, so who cares?

294
00:23:04,170 --> 00:23:06,753
[SPEAKER_13]: But I did buy the last two that they had, so that was kind of cool.

295
00:23:07,593 --> 00:23:12,778
[SPEAKER_13]: And then I'm sure I'll eventually use them, but I just haven't gotten around to it yet.

296
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:16,902
[SPEAKER_13]: But yeah, that's pretty much what's been going on.

297
00:23:16,942 --> 00:23:22,248
[SPEAKER_13]: I have a lot of games on deck, I guess, to play, and I just haven't really...

298
00:23:23,433 --> 00:23:26,275
[SPEAKER_13]: Red Faction Guerrilla or Arma 2 this week or something.

299
00:23:43,151 --> 00:23:43,471
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

300
00:23:44,311 --> 00:23:44,771
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, let's see.

301
00:23:44,831 --> 00:23:46,952
[SPEAKER_16]: I'll start with games, then I'll get into personal stuff.

302
00:23:46,972 --> 00:23:47,712
[SPEAKER_16]: Let's see.

303
00:23:47,752 --> 00:23:48,532
[SPEAKER_16]: Games I played this week.

304
00:23:48,572 --> 00:23:49,592
[SPEAKER_16]: I've still been playing Fuel.

305
00:23:49,772 --> 00:23:52,173
[SPEAKER_16]: I think I've played Fuel more than Loki has now.

306
00:23:52,273 --> 00:23:52,593
[SPEAKER_13]: I know.

307
00:23:52,673 --> 00:23:55,014
[SPEAKER_16]: I keep wanting to go back to him.

308
00:23:55,174 --> 00:23:57,294
[SPEAKER_16]: I've unlocked four zones now, which is still nothing.

309
00:23:57,314 --> 00:23:58,654
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, there's like 19 zones.

310
00:23:59,495 --> 00:24:02,715
[SPEAKER_16]: There's a lot of orange to peel in Fuel.

311
00:24:03,536 --> 00:24:05,536
[SPEAKER_16]: How are the third and fourth zones?

312
00:24:05,836 --> 00:24:07,036
[SPEAKER_16]: What's the third one they unlocked?

313
00:24:08,157 --> 00:24:09,937
[SPEAKER_16]: It's in the middle, the dry run, I think.

314
00:24:10,017 --> 00:24:10,518
[SPEAKER_16]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

315
00:24:32,321 --> 00:24:32,881
[SPEAKER_16]: That's awesome.

316
00:24:32,921 --> 00:24:34,262
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, I thought it was actually kind of cool.

317
00:24:34,602 --> 00:24:36,302
[SPEAKER_16]: It really helps in some of the races too.

318
00:24:36,583 --> 00:24:38,503
[SPEAKER_16]: I guess you could say it's cheating, but whatever.

319
00:24:38,703 --> 00:24:39,084
[SPEAKER_16]: Who cares?

320
00:24:39,144 --> 00:24:40,004
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a glitch in the game.

321
00:24:40,044 --> 00:24:40,764
[SPEAKER_16]: It's a silly game.

322
00:24:41,104 --> 00:24:47,066
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, I don't think fuel should be taken extremely seriously, but it's big, dumb, stupid fun.

323
00:24:48,167 --> 00:24:50,148
[SPEAKER_16]: And the world really is huge.

324
00:24:51,588 --> 00:24:54,370
[SPEAKER_16]: I can see, though, some of the reviews I've read say, you know, and I've talked about this game.

325
00:24:54,410 --> 00:24:56,551
[SPEAKER_16]: It's probably going on my third week talking about this game.

326
00:24:56,571 --> 00:24:59,433
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't want to kind of reinvent the wheel here.

327
00:24:59,753 --> 00:25:05,976
[SPEAKER_16]: But I think one of the most common negative things I've read in reviews is that, yeah, you have this big open world, but full of what?

328
00:25:06,316 --> 00:25:07,817
[SPEAKER_16]: There's really not a lot in it.

329
00:25:08,257 --> 00:25:12,560
[SPEAKER_16]: And I think I kind of am getting to understand that point of view a little more.

330
00:25:12,660 --> 00:25:15,662
[SPEAKER_16]: Although I do find this game fun, I think a lot of the courses are pretty cool.

331
00:25:16,762 --> 00:25:22,849
[SPEAKER_16]: There isn't a lot that really, at least in the first few areas Have you gotten to any of the weather things like tornadoes and stuff?

332
00:25:22,869 --> 00:25:38,506
[SPEAKER_16]: Not the tornadoes and stuff, so that's where I'm hoping we'll kind of change my mind I've seen some screenshots of that and that looks crazy I did do a heavy wind type race, but all that did was kind of decrease my visibility and put this weird filter on that just made it look like stuff was blowing in front of my car and everything the whole time It was, I don't know

333
00:25:39,383 --> 00:25:40,644
[SPEAKER_16]: Thanks for watching!

334
00:25:57,899 --> 00:26:01,461
[SPEAKER_16]: So here I am trying to, like, I've unlocked an achievement now for getting 10 Vista points.

335
00:26:01,501 --> 00:26:02,962
[SPEAKER_16]: I think I'm up to, like, 12 Vista points.

336
00:26:03,282 --> 00:26:14,809
[SPEAKER_16]: And for some reason, that's, like, my big goal in this game right now is, like, okay, I gotta play the arcade races until I can get the Doppler truck that I can run into to get the Vista points because I want all the Vista points because that's supposed to be the prettiest areas in the game.

337
00:26:15,129 --> 00:26:15,750
[SPEAKER_16]: I'll tell you what.

338
00:26:16,650 --> 00:26:17,010
[SPEAKER_16]: DarkSakura.com

339
00:26:40,881 --> 00:26:46,105
[SPEAKER_16]: I will tell you the one thing that does drive me nuts.

340
00:26:46,245 --> 00:26:50,128
[SPEAKER_16]: I installed Fueled My Hard Drive and I think it's causing more crashes than ought to be there.

341
00:26:51,489 --> 00:26:58,134
[SPEAKER_16]: Sometimes after I do a challenge, if I do a challenge right out of the camp, the game locks up on me when I try to go back to free run.

342
00:26:58,895 --> 00:27:00,095
[SPEAKER_16]: The loading times are just...

343
00:27:00,956 --> 00:27:01,717
[SPEAKER_16]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

344
00:27:23,032 --> 00:27:27,213
[SPEAKER_16]: If I'm not going to exit that menu, unless I'm going to race.

345
00:27:27,233 --> 00:27:31,794
[SPEAKER_13]: It's loading the actual area of the arc, because when you exit the menu, it doesn't have any load time, I don't think.

346
00:27:32,694 --> 00:27:33,434
[SPEAKER_13]: It just seems weird.

347
00:27:33,734 --> 00:27:34,575
[SPEAKER_16]: The loading times are weird.

348
00:27:34,875 --> 00:27:41,456
[SPEAKER_16]: But honestly, it's not a perfect game, but I am having fun with it, and I think that's what's most important at the bottom line.

349
00:27:41,476 --> 00:27:44,357
[SPEAKER_16]: I can be as critical as I want of a video game on these.

350
00:27:44,817 --> 00:27:47,257
[SPEAKER_16]: I've driven right through a tree.

351
00:27:47,417 --> 00:27:49,018
[SPEAKER_16]: There are some very big...

352
00:27:49,838 --> 00:27:50,379
[SPEAKER_16]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

353
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:10,001
[SPEAKER_16]: There is some silly fun in it.

354
00:28:10,041 --> 00:28:13,744
[SPEAKER_13]: All those ramp houses have fuel on top of them that you have to stop and get.

355
00:28:14,965 --> 00:28:16,287
[SPEAKER_16]: I usually don't stop for fuel.

356
00:28:16,627 --> 00:28:23,934
[SPEAKER_16]: I'll try to run into it if I'm driving by it, but otherwise... It's funny, when I play on Xbox Live and turn Xbox Live on, there's nobody around anywhere.

357
00:28:24,615 --> 00:28:25,276
[SPEAKER_16]: Just because...

358
00:28:26,302 --> 00:28:28,743
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm surprised they don't have a way to turn that on by default.

359
00:28:28,823 --> 00:28:32,444
[SPEAKER_16]: I think more people would be using it if it was like test drive where it was on by default.

360
00:28:32,845 --> 00:28:33,345
[SPEAKER_16]: You know what I mean?

361
00:28:34,105 --> 00:28:35,245
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.

362
00:28:36,126 --> 00:28:36,426
[SPEAKER_16]: Let's see.

363
00:28:36,506 --> 00:28:37,806
[SPEAKER_16]: Other games I've been playing this week.

364
00:28:38,146 --> 00:28:39,047
[SPEAKER_16]: Magic the Gathering.

365
00:28:39,107 --> 00:28:42,828
[SPEAKER_16]: I actually bought Magic the Gathering on Xbox Live despite our little story about it last week.

366
00:28:43,328 --> 00:28:45,249
[SPEAKER_16]: I know DarkSakura is holding up the cards.

367
00:28:45,289 --> 00:28:46,149
[SPEAKER_16]: We still have to have our duel.

368
00:28:46,449 --> 00:28:48,690
[SPEAKER_16]: But you see, I need to remember how to play again.

369
00:28:49,190 --> 00:28:51,131
[SPEAKER_16]: So that's why I downloaded the Xbox Live version.

370
00:28:51,291 --> 00:28:53,432
[SPEAKER_07]: That was the whole point that we were going to play Unpracticed.

371
00:28:53,812 --> 00:28:54,353
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, my bad.

372
00:28:54,873 --> 00:28:55,834
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, I couldn't resist.

373
00:28:55,874 --> 00:28:56,635
[SPEAKER_16]: I had to check it out.

374
00:28:57,096 --> 00:28:58,717
[SPEAKER_16]: But yeah, I mean...

375
00:28:59,955 --> 00:29:03,076
[SPEAKER_16]: If you like the card game, it's a fairly faithful reinterpretation.

376
00:29:03,536 --> 00:29:03,977
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know.

377
00:29:04,717 --> 00:29:09,539
[SPEAKER_16]: I still think nothing beats the actual cards for a card game.

378
00:29:10,039 --> 00:29:12,640
[SPEAKER_16]: But I guess they did a pretty good job with the translation.

379
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:13,580
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, you know what?

380
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:15,601
[SPEAKER_16]: Uno, I could make the same argument there.

381
00:29:16,061 --> 00:29:19,483
[SPEAKER_16]: Uno's a card game, but it's still kind of fun on Xbox Live because you have the camera and everything.

382
00:29:19,743 --> 00:29:20,423
[SPEAKER_16]: And I was surprised.

383
00:29:20,603 --> 00:29:22,344
[SPEAKER_16]: Imagine the Gathering has the camera built in too.

384
00:29:22,364 --> 00:29:23,104
[SPEAKER_16]: I didn't realize that.

385
00:29:23,444 --> 00:29:26,005
[SPEAKER_16]: So hooray, a game I can get use out of my Xbox Live camera.

386
00:29:26,025 --> 00:29:26,645
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm excited.

387
00:29:27,546 --> 00:29:27,606
[SPEAKER_16]: Um...

388
00:29:28,366 --> 00:29:32,689
[SPEAKER_16]: But yeah, the game itself, I suck at it, but I was able to at least beat the first guy.

389
00:29:33,229 --> 00:29:34,890
[SPEAKER_16]: And, you know, it's cool.

390
00:29:35,290 --> 00:29:37,832
[SPEAKER_16]: I was having a problem figuring out how to edit my deck, though.

391
00:29:37,852 --> 00:29:39,993
[SPEAKER_16]: It's not very intuitive in that regard.

392
00:29:40,553 --> 00:29:44,015
[SPEAKER_16]: And I'm not looking forward to all the microtransactions that I'm sure to come with this.

393
00:29:44,575 --> 00:29:53,601
[SPEAKER_16]: But, you know what, for what it is, and considering it's only $10, when the card game itself can start to cost you a lot more very quickly, it's worth checking out.

394
00:29:54,201 --> 00:29:54,822
[SPEAKER_16]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

395
00:30:21,443 --> 00:30:22,384
[SPEAKER_16]: Thanks for watching!

396
00:30:44,638 --> 00:30:45,400
[SPEAKER_16]: I didn't play it enough.

397
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:52,517
[SPEAKER_16]: I need to play it more, but for an early review, I will say I had a lot more fun with it than I was expecting to.

398
00:30:54,082 --> 00:30:55,203
[SPEAKER_16]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

399
00:31:15,698 --> 00:31:21,800
[SPEAKER_16]: and we all like to run around in our G-strings and assless leather chaps wearing nothing but handcuffs.

400
00:31:22,841 --> 00:31:26,642
[SPEAKER_16]: And that is so not true and definitely not me, okay?

401
00:31:27,322 --> 00:31:27,962
[SPEAKER_16]: That's for sure.

402
00:31:28,523 --> 00:31:31,924
[SPEAKER_16]: A, I don't have the body for that, so you can thank yourselves ahead of time for that.

403
00:31:32,324 --> 00:31:37,806
[SPEAKER_16]: And B, it's just not really, you know... Sure, I've done Rocky Horror Picture Show for a long time, but the rest of that...

404
00:31:38,366 --> 00:32:05,956
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, the big stuff they do out there I don't know, it's just not me And I don't like the fact that it's the impression that some people get Because some people are naive So I used to kind of have a problem with it because it was so excessive But let me tell you this In straight culture, there's a lot of excessive stuff as well I mean, think about it Pride is no different from a Playboy mansion party The girls next door MTV's Spring Break Thank you very much How is that any worse than what goes on at Gay Pride?

405
00:32:07,126 --> 00:32:07,787
[SPEAKER_16]: It's really not.

406
00:32:08,167 --> 00:32:11,350
[SPEAKER_16]: MTV Spring Break is just as bad as anything you're going to see in San Francisco.

407
00:32:13,472 --> 00:32:19,857
[SPEAKER_07]: I haven't been to the parade there, but I've been to the Castro Street Fair, which I've heard has almost a similar reputation.

408
00:32:20,498 --> 00:32:21,398
[SPEAKER_07]: And it was really...

409
00:32:22,774 --> 00:32:23,595
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura.com

410
00:32:40,966 --> 00:32:45,068
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, you know what, and then I always hear that argument, what about straight pride?

411
00:32:45,368 --> 00:32:54,173
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, I mean like MTV Spring Break is a little bit of straight pride I think in a way, but also I don't think pride necessarily has to do with just being gay.

412
00:32:54,553 --> 00:32:55,674
[SPEAKER_16]: I think it's about just being different.

413
00:32:56,334 --> 00:32:56,854
[SPEAKER_16]: Out of the Closet

414
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:15,062
[SPEAKER_16]: and I don't feel the gay shame that I used to.

415
00:33:15,303 --> 00:33:30,072
[SPEAKER_07]: I actually do still agree though with Patton Oswalt is that the gay pride parade should actually tour from state to state and go everywhere instead of just the cities where you're not really shocked by it existing like Tuscaloosa.

416
00:33:31,264 --> 00:33:31,484
[SPEAKER_16]: Nice.

417
00:33:32,425 --> 00:33:38,787
[SPEAKER_16]: So yeah, I did that today and that was cool, except for having to stand out in the blaring sun for like two hours, less cool.

418
00:33:39,488 --> 00:33:40,468
[SPEAKER_07]: But you're in San Francisco?

419
00:33:40,908 --> 00:33:41,629
[SPEAKER_16]: It still was hot.

420
00:33:41,749 --> 00:33:44,930
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, even though it's San Francisco right by the ocean, you have a nice breeze, it was still hot.

421
00:33:45,470 --> 00:33:49,512
[SPEAKER_16]: What was kind of cool, speaking of hot, Gavin Newsom walked right by us.

422
00:33:49,712 --> 00:33:51,013
[SPEAKER_16]: So we got to like, he was like right there.

423
00:33:51,093 --> 00:33:53,934
[SPEAKER_16]: And Victoria, who hasn't been on the show in a long time.

424
00:33:54,474 --> 00:34:00,456
[SPEAKER_16]: Gavin Newsom, he's the mayor of San Francisco, and he's going to be running for governor in 2010.

425
00:34:01,176 --> 00:34:04,397
[SPEAKER_16]: He walked right by, and Victoria exclaimed, oh my god, he's even hotter in person.

426
00:34:04,457 --> 00:34:05,937
[SPEAKER_07]: I was thinking of someone else for some reason.

427
00:34:07,218 --> 00:34:08,878
[SPEAKER_16]: No, he's very controversial.

428
00:34:09,298 --> 00:34:16,220
[SPEAKER_16]: But anyway, I'm not going to get into politics too much in there, but it was just kind of cool to see someone that a lot of people know right there.

429
00:34:17,841 --> 00:34:22,122
[SPEAKER_16]: Let's see, the rest of my week outside of today, I'm going to be honest, I've had a very...

430
00:34:23,385 --> 00:34:24,367
[SPEAKER_16]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

431
00:34:38,667 --> 00:34:39,808
[SPEAKER_13]: and I had it in my car.

432
00:34:40,089 --> 00:34:41,170
[SPEAKER_16]: Shocking, right?

433
00:34:41,230 --> 00:34:42,712
[SPEAKER_16]: But I don't know what happened.

434
00:34:42,752 --> 00:34:50,561
[SPEAKER_16]: I think just everybody was just kind of into just talking and, you know, the TV just hardly ever got turned on but for music on the cable music channels.

435
00:34:50,941 --> 00:34:53,865
[SPEAKER_16]: So it was just kind of like, you know, just kind of a different type of party which was cool.

436
00:34:54,986 --> 00:34:55,346
[SPEAKER_16]: Let's see.

437
00:34:55,627 --> 00:34:58,850
[SPEAKER_16]: And as far as the rest of my week, okay, look, like...

438
00:34:59,791 --> 00:35:06,297
[SPEAKER_16]: What a crazy week it's been, especially if you're a Hollywood celebrity right now, right?

439
00:35:06,878 --> 00:35:17,608
[SPEAKER_16]: And you might be wondering, I wonder if OLR is going to be doing a tribute tonight to Michael Jackson, or Farrah Fawcett, or Ed McMahon, or that infomercial guy, what was his name?

440
00:35:18,349 --> 00:35:19,390
[SPEAKER_16]: Was that the ShamWow guy?

441
00:35:19,550 --> 00:35:20,030
[SPEAKER_13]: Billy Mays.

442
00:35:20,171 --> 00:35:21,171
[SPEAKER_16]: Billy Mays, okay, I don't...

443
00:35:21,892 --> 00:35:23,113
[SPEAKER_16]: Obviously, I don't follow this stuff.

444
00:35:23,213 --> 00:35:24,654
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't stay up late enough.

445
00:35:25,975 --> 00:35:27,056
[SPEAKER_16]: But okay, so he passed away.

446
00:35:27,076 --> 00:35:37,004
[SPEAKER_16]: But see, I've had a lot more weighing on my mind this week because somebody I actually know who I don't... And one of the first questions I got asked about this was, has she been on the show before?

447
00:35:37,184 --> 00:35:40,046
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't believe she has, even in the many years of this show.

448
00:35:40,066 --> 00:35:40,727
[SPEAKER_16]: I think a lot of people...

449
00:35:41,587 --> 00:36:00,579
[SPEAKER_16]: are on the show know of her her name was Beth and she passed away on Tuesday which sadly was also the anniversary of the show and she passed away from swine flu or H1N1 virus she'd been in the hospital for 11 days and unfortunately succumbed to complications of swine flu basically her

450
00:36:01,259 --> 00:36:05,282
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't want to get into gory detail, but her kidneys failed, her lungs failed.

451
00:36:05,383 --> 00:36:08,125
[SPEAKER_16]: She was brain dead, and that was the end of it.

452
00:36:08,265 --> 00:36:10,647
[SPEAKER_16]: So they had to do what they did there.

453
00:36:11,247 --> 00:36:14,930
[SPEAKER_16]: And it was just kind of the whole thing's kind of weird.

454
00:36:15,330 --> 00:36:16,591
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't really know how else to explain it.

455
00:36:16,811 --> 00:36:17,192
[SPEAKER_06]: Surreal?

456
00:36:17,612 --> 00:36:18,713
[SPEAKER_16]: It's very surreal.

457
00:36:18,853 --> 00:36:19,914
[SPEAKER_16]: I haven't really...

458
00:36:20,394 --> 00:36:29,705
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, I'm not going to proclaim that I was Beth's BFF in the world, but I really respected this woman, and I saw what a motherly figure she was to all her gays, and just people in general.

459
00:36:29,745 --> 00:36:34,431
[SPEAKER_16]: Not just the gays, but people in general, and just what an accepting, fun person she was.

460
00:36:34,511 --> 00:36:36,313
[SPEAKER_16]: She was always the type that lit up a room.

461
00:36:36,653 --> 00:36:39,596
[SPEAKER_16]: One thing I will never forget about Beth is she was the first person to tell me

462
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:41,100
[SPEAKER_16]: www.DarkSakura.com

463
00:36:58,331 --> 00:37:00,333
[SPEAKER_16]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

464
00:37:16,889 --> 00:37:17,389
[SPEAKER_16]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

465
00:37:38,308 --> 00:38:04,041
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't I'm treating this like a four-year-old deals with death I'm like literally thinking in my mind we're gonna go have a party we're gonna go hang with Beth they're throwing a fat party at Beth's house it's gonna rock but like the there's a part of me that still doesn't get that she's like not here you know and I because I think it's something that nobody understands like H1N1 that I'm not able to wrap my head around it this week so I apologize if I'm not

466
00:38:05,419 --> 00:38:06,420
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't think anyone blames you.

467
00:38:27,031 --> 00:38:37,770
[SPEAKER_16]: but I understand I'm coming to terms with why the media shoves this down our throat for the same reason why Beth was splashed over every local news station here in Sacramento is that

468
00:38:40,866 --> 00:38:42,587
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't want to get too deep here on a video game talk show.

469
00:38:42,607 --> 00:38:44,647
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm sorry, but this has been a lot that's been on my mind this week.

470
00:38:44,787 --> 00:38:45,787
[SPEAKER_16]: Seven years, we do what we want, right?

471
00:38:47,548 --> 00:38:50,149
[SPEAKER_16]: Death is something that we don't understand.

472
00:38:50,989 --> 00:38:55,470
[SPEAKER_16]: We have a lot of reasons and things that we try to come up with to explain it.

473
00:38:55,510 --> 00:38:56,650
[SPEAKER_16]: That's religion, right?

474
00:38:57,691 --> 00:39:00,451
[SPEAKER_16]: But at the end of the day, we don't really understand death.

475
00:39:01,532 --> 00:39:02,552
[SPEAKER_16]: So when it happens...

476
00:39:04,292 --> 00:39:08,474
[SPEAKER_16]: We do what we can to try and, I guess, understand it.

477
00:39:09,414 --> 00:39:09,694
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know.

478
00:39:09,714 --> 00:39:10,775
[SPEAKER_16]: Is there something you wanted to point out?

479
00:39:10,935 --> 00:39:19,859
[SPEAKER_07]: I actually wrote a blog post about it after because the day that you posted about Beth, one of my good friends at work, we found out he died.

480
00:39:20,059 --> 00:39:20,499
[SPEAKER_16]: That's right.

481
00:39:21,019 --> 00:39:38,960
[SPEAKER_07]: and I found out that he had been a little sick but was just going to go see the doctor because he was experiencing heartburn but of course heartburn also was one of the first signs of a heart attack and he didn't come in on Monday and I actually was looking for him on Monday we had been talking about Linux and I was going to show him my laptop and

482
00:39:41,671 --> 00:39:42,132
[SPEAKER_07]: We didn't see him.

483
00:39:42,172 --> 00:39:42,752
[SPEAKER_07]: We didn't hear from him.

484
00:39:42,792 --> 00:39:44,353
[SPEAKER_07]: He's always super good about calling in.

485
00:39:44,473 --> 00:39:45,814
[SPEAKER_07]: He's like the man there.

486
00:39:45,874 --> 00:39:48,096
[SPEAKER_07]: He knows so much about everything, you know.

487
00:39:48,856 --> 00:39:50,677
[SPEAKER_07]: And just completely fun to be around.

488
00:39:50,818 --> 00:39:55,661
[SPEAKER_07]: And then Tuesday, one of the people in his department called his sister.

489
00:39:56,361 --> 00:40:00,264
[SPEAKER_07]: And so she sent her husband to go check on... His name's Pete.

490
00:40:00,925 --> 00:40:04,647
[SPEAKER_07]: Went to go check on over at Pete's apartment and found him dead.

491
00:40:05,568 --> 00:40:05,668
[SPEAKER_07]: So...

492
00:40:07,706 --> 00:40:36,774
[SPEAKER_07]: and I freaked out and then of course that same afternoon is when I went in to have my consultation so but it's like I came home it was I think I actually wrote up my my post on my blog and I'll link it in the chat if anyone wants to see it just about getting it all out because it's like you were saying and my own belief is that and this is again this me I'm sorry for getting philosophical is it just happens I don't think anyone's singled out I don't think that there's any sort of cosmic vendetta that I don't I don't really believe in karma

493
00:40:37,174 --> 00:40:42,820
[SPEAKER_16]: I want to make this very clear because a lot of people even locally and reading comments on news stations and stuff misunderstand this.

494
00:40:42,860 --> 00:40:44,021
[SPEAKER_16]: I want to make some things clear.

495
00:40:44,382 --> 00:40:45,683
[SPEAKER_16]: Beth did not go to Mexico.

496
00:40:46,103 --> 00:40:48,426
[SPEAKER_16]: Beth went to Las Vegas, but Beth did not go to Mexico.

497
00:40:49,046 --> 00:40:49,286
[SPEAKER_16]: Beth...

498
00:40:50,605 --> 00:40:52,266
[SPEAKER_16]: None of Beth's friends have this disease.

499
00:40:52,987 --> 00:40:55,528
[SPEAKER_16]: Those that live with her, those that know her, have been tested for it.

500
00:40:56,189 --> 00:40:57,890
[SPEAKER_16]: This is an isolated incident.

501
00:40:58,090 --> 00:40:59,371
[SPEAKER_16]: She was healthy.

502
00:41:00,111 --> 00:41:02,153
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes, she was a little overweight, but you know what?

503
00:41:02,173 --> 00:41:03,594
[SPEAKER_16]: So were most of Americans.

504
00:41:04,214 --> 00:41:06,375
[SPEAKER_16]: Welcome to the USA.

505
00:41:06,656 --> 00:41:10,278
[SPEAKER_16]: She was a healthy, fun-loving, happy individual.

506
00:41:11,659 --> 00:41:12,900
[SPEAKER_16]: This has not been explained.

507
00:41:13,420 --> 00:41:14,681
[SPEAKER_16]: This may not be explained.

508
00:41:15,421 --> 00:41:15,822
[SPEAKER_16]: That's the...

509
00:41:16,642 --> 00:41:17,423
[SPEAKER_16]: Weird thing about it.

510
00:41:17,843 --> 00:41:18,623
[SPEAKER_16]: It happened.

511
00:41:18,903 --> 00:41:34,332
[SPEAKER_07]: Honestly, that's really in my belief system is that disasters, whether they be something like this, whether they be a hurricane, whether they be a flood, it's not... I don't think that it's any... God's punishing people.

512
00:41:35,033 --> 00:41:36,374
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't believe that God punishes people.

513
00:41:36,414 --> 00:41:39,295
[SPEAKER_07]: I think God's got way too many other things to do to deal with our petty little problems.

514
00:41:39,876 --> 00:41:40,196
[SPEAKER_07]: Honestly.

515
00:41:41,483 --> 00:41:48,350
[SPEAKER_07]: And so, I don't believe that there's a great cosmic hand in the disasters or the good things that happen in life.

516
00:41:48,390 --> 00:41:51,833
[SPEAKER_07]: I think they just happen because they're set in motion to happen.

517
00:41:52,534 --> 00:41:56,798
[SPEAKER_07]: They're not predestined, just, it's, this is how it happens.

518
00:41:56,918 --> 00:42:03,064
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, she may not have had a good immune system as far as that goes because, you know, some people, like...

519
00:42:04,125 --> 00:42:12,289
[SPEAKER_07]: I've known people who have been almost hospitalized from just plain old illnesses.

520
00:42:12,430 --> 00:42:16,252
[SPEAKER_07]: I had pneumonia for three months and almost went in the hospital.

521
00:42:17,412 --> 00:42:21,794
[SPEAKER_07]: I just really think it just happens, and the best way to deal with it is just accept that it happens.

522
00:42:22,995 --> 00:42:23,735
[SPEAKER_07]: Remember the good parts.

523
00:42:53,086 --> 00:42:56,487
[SPEAKER_16]: That was a huge thing in television at the time.

524
00:42:56,928 --> 00:43:00,709
[SPEAKER_16]: Because that actor who had played Mr. Hooper died and they had to explain that to the children.

525
00:43:01,009 --> 00:43:08,372
[SPEAKER_16]: Because I don't know how they do Sesame Street now, but back then they kind of taped it, like, not live, but, you know, it was kind of, you know, it was only a couple weeks behind.

526
00:43:08,393 --> 00:43:09,173
[SPEAKER_16]: A little off the cuff, too.

527
00:43:09,193 --> 00:43:09,713
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what I mean?

528
00:43:09,753 --> 00:43:11,094
[SPEAKER_16]: Like, it was kind of unfolding.

529
00:43:11,214 --> 00:43:12,134
[SPEAKER_16]: So they had to explain it.

530
00:43:12,474 --> 00:43:13,795
[SPEAKER_16]: And the way they explained it...

531
00:43:14,375 --> 00:43:16,637
[SPEAKER_16]: and Big Bird was so upset about it.

532
00:43:16,697 --> 00:43:17,658
[SPEAKER_16]: Go watch this on YouTube.

533
00:43:17,938 --> 00:43:21,040
[SPEAKER_16]: You want to see one of the greatest television... I'm not... I am not fucking with you.

534
00:43:21,080 --> 00:43:23,362
[SPEAKER_16]: This is one of the greatest television moments ever.

535
00:43:23,903 --> 00:43:25,624
[SPEAKER_16]: Go look up... I watch this live.

536
00:43:26,024 --> 00:43:29,307
[SPEAKER_16]: Go watch Big Bird and Mr. Hooper's death.

537
00:43:29,347 --> 00:43:29,607
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know.

538
00:43:30,368 --> 00:43:31,589
[SPEAKER_16]: YouTube Mr. Hooper death.

539
00:43:31,609 --> 00:43:32,349
[SPEAKER_16]: You'll find it somewhere.

540
00:43:32,990 --> 00:43:36,492
[SPEAKER_16]: And watch how they explain it because the way they explain it to Big Bird is that he's...

541
00:43:37,353 --> 00:43:47,827
[SPEAKER_16]: he's wailing, he's bawling he's crying, he's talking about I miss him, I don't understand why he's not coming back and finally the only answer that he'll accept this is just something that happens yeah

542
00:43:48,317 --> 00:44:16,886
[SPEAKER_16]: so anyway I don't mean to get too off the subject but with the whole you know tributes to Michael Jackson and all this stuff especially you know and all this stuff in the media and so forth you know I don't really want to join in but at the same time I understand I mean don't get me wrong the man made great contributions to popular culture say what you will about his personal life whatever his personal life ain't none of my business you know well unless he broke well whatever I'm not going to get into that he is who he is yeah let's leave it at that but

543
00:44:17,865 --> 00:44:28,419
[SPEAKER_16]: I think the reason why everybody's talking about it and the reason why it's in the media and all this other stuff is that this topic kind of brings people closer together.

544
00:44:28,839 --> 00:44:31,242
[SPEAKER_16]: It kind of helps people try and understand

545
00:44:32,740 --> 00:44:33,801
[SPEAKER_16]: What cannot be explained.

546
00:44:34,361 --> 00:44:37,024
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, who hasn't heard a Michael Jackson song?

547
00:44:37,985 --> 00:44:40,968
[SPEAKER_16]: Everybody has heard a fucking Michael Jackson song at some point in their life.

548
00:44:40,988 --> 00:44:41,689
[SPEAKER_16]: Unless they're deaf.

549
00:44:43,531 --> 00:44:44,652
[SPEAKER_16]: You know what I mean.

550
00:44:44,752 --> 00:44:46,374
[SPEAKER_16]: Even then, you've probably seen him dance.

551
00:44:47,515 --> 00:44:52,460
[SPEAKER_16]: You have somehow been influenced by this guy one way or the other.

552
00:44:52,781 --> 00:44:54,603
[SPEAKER_16]: So when somebody like that passes away...

553
00:44:55,834 --> 00:44:58,496
[SPEAKER_16]: There's definitely, everybody's going to feel that type of connection.

554
00:44:58,536 --> 00:45:00,657
[SPEAKER_16]: Like, oh, I remember that song.

555
00:45:01,018 --> 00:45:03,019
[SPEAKER_16]: Or, oh, I remember watching it on TV.

556
00:45:03,079 --> 00:45:05,541
[SPEAKER_16]: And like, I'm not going to get to see that again.

557
00:45:05,741 --> 00:45:07,002
[SPEAKER_16]: Although, that's not really the case.

558
00:45:07,082 --> 00:45:11,565
[SPEAKER_16]: Because the nice thing about being an artist is the contributions you make live on forever.

559
00:45:12,045 --> 00:45:20,190
[SPEAKER_07]: It feels like something that, and I'm not going to say, because honestly, once I got older, I didn't really care for his stuff too much anymore.

560
00:45:20,231 --> 00:45:21,832
[SPEAKER_07]: But I had a Michael Jackson doll when I was little.

561
00:45:22,532 --> 00:45:23,112
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

562
00:45:42,922 --> 00:45:45,783
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, you know, it's that sort of, huh, feeling.

563
00:45:46,543 --> 00:45:51,264
[SPEAKER_16]: But like, okay, but with the infomercial guy that died today, like, I'm not understanding that one.

564
00:45:52,424 --> 00:45:55,384
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, do people really truly miss him?

565
00:45:55,424 --> 00:45:59,225
[SPEAKER_16]: There aren't his friends and family, which I'm very sorry to hear about their loss.

566
00:45:59,285 --> 00:46:00,505
[SPEAKER_16]: It sounds like it was a sudden thing.

567
00:46:00,885 --> 00:46:03,706
[SPEAKER_16]: But for the, like, it's a trending topic on Twitter, okay?

568
00:46:04,226 --> 00:46:04,866
[SPEAKER_16]: Like, really?

569
00:46:05,366 --> 00:46:07,466
[SPEAKER_16]: I think that... Was he really that influential?

570
00:46:07,506 --> 00:46:08,687
[SPEAKER_16]: Like, maybe I'm missing something.

571
00:46:08,927 --> 00:46:10,547
[SPEAKER_16]: And I'm sorry, I don't mean to offend, but...

572
00:46:11,147 --> 00:46:14,111
[SPEAKER_07]: Keep in mind, he spawned a lot of funny.

573
00:46:14,672 --> 00:46:17,616
[SPEAKER_07]: He was one of those things, oh, ha, ha, ha, you know, that you sort of just mention about.

574
00:46:17,636 --> 00:46:19,138
[SPEAKER_16]: So it's like a 4chan funeral or something?

575
00:46:19,979 --> 00:46:21,140
[SPEAKER_07]: I would expect so.

576
00:46:21,240 --> 00:46:23,584
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's just more like, oh, that guy?

577
00:46:24,565 --> 00:46:28,290
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, because you don't have him to kick around anymore.

578
00:46:28,806 --> 00:46:29,026
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.

579
00:46:29,106 --> 00:46:29,407
[SPEAKER_16]: You know?

580
00:46:29,767 --> 00:46:30,047
[SPEAKER_16]: I know.

581
00:46:30,668 --> 00:46:34,370
[SPEAKER_07]: I was actually, though, for all the celebrity deaths, I was the saddest about Farrah Fawcett.

582
00:46:35,251 --> 00:46:36,512
[SPEAKER_07]: Not because of her fantastic hair.

583
00:46:37,733 --> 00:46:39,975
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think it's horrible, though, to die of anal cancer.

584
00:46:40,575 --> 00:46:43,538
[SPEAKER_16]: That's just a horrible thing.

585
00:46:43,598 --> 00:46:47,361
[SPEAKER_16]: If I try to watch her NBC special, I get incredibly, I can't watch it.

586
00:46:47,461 --> 00:46:49,663
[SPEAKER_16]: Like, I get so choked up, I feel like I'm gonna barf.

587
00:46:49,723 --> 00:46:51,064
[SPEAKER_07]: But you know what I think the worst thing was?

588
00:46:51,124 --> 00:46:52,425
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that she was gonna marry, what's his name?

589
00:46:52,705 --> 00:46:52,945
[SPEAKER_16]: I know.

590
00:46:53,405 --> 00:46:53,905
[SPEAKER_16]: Anyway, I'm sorry.

591
00:46:54,125 --> 00:46:59,867
[SPEAKER_16]: We are like taking this video game talk show and really just getting way too deep tonight on our 7th anniversary which is supposed to be so important.

592
00:46:59,907 --> 00:47:01,207
[SPEAKER_07]: It's our fucking show!

593
00:47:03,728 --> 00:47:04,428
[SPEAKER_07]: Guess what?

594
00:47:05,049 --> 00:47:06,289
[SPEAKER_07]: There's no Santa Claus either.

595
00:47:07,749 --> 00:47:10,010
[SPEAKER_07]: And the Easter Bunny was made up by Pagans.

596
00:47:13,330 --> 00:47:24,813
[SPEAKER_16]: Bobby Blackwolf, our old buddy here, one thing to realize is that he was also on a reality show on Discovery about Pitchman, and a lot of people watched that because it showed more about the way he was outside of screaming, here's how to order.

597
00:47:25,573 --> 00:47:28,894
[SPEAKER_16]: So that's why I think more people got hit by Billy Mays than you would expect.

598
00:47:28,994 --> 00:47:32,034
[SPEAKER_13]: I watch Pitchman, and yeah, all he does is scream on the show.

599
00:47:32,594 --> 00:47:33,515
[SPEAKER_13]: No, really he doesn't.

600
00:47:33,635 --> 00:47:35,135
[SPEAKER_13]: It kind of makes me sad.

601
00:47:35,575 --> 00:47:39,716
[SPEAKER_13]: It's weird, out of, no offense to Beth or anything, but out of all the celebrity deaths,

602
00:47:40,578 --> 00:47:42,479
[SPEAKER_13]: Actually, the Billy Mays one was the most surprising.

603
00:47:42,499 --> 00:47:44,360
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, it's like, holy crap.

604
00:47:44,560 --> 00:47:45,481
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm like, what the hell?

605
00:47:46,361 --> 00:47:53,045
[SPEAKER_13]: There's somebody that's in perfectly good health, but apparently the circumstances revolved around it.

606
00:47:53,085 --> 00:48:06,913
[SPEAKER_13]: Apparently he was on a plane that landed really, I don't know, had a bad landing, I guess, and it caused part of the ceiling or whatever to hit him in the head and maybe did some brain damage that way and he died in his sleep.

607
00:48:06,993 --> 00:48:07,293
[SPEAKER_16]: What?

608
00:48:07,774 --> 00:48:07,954
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

609
00:48:09,454 --> 00:48:10,694
[SPEAKER_13]: It was an American Airlines flight.

610
00:48:11,095 --> 00:48:13,736
[SPEAKER_13]: So that's what's going on there.

611
00:48:14,676 --> 00:48:16,137
[SPEAKER_13]: He died a few days later, I guess.

612
00:48:17,037 --> 00:48:19,538
[SPEAKER_16]: That so doesn't sound real.

613
00:48:19,838 --> 00:48:24,800
[SPEAKER_16]: We would be hearing so much more about an impending lawsuit and all this stuff.

614
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:26,640
[SPEAKER_13]: I think there will be an impending lawsuit.

615
00:48:27,341 --> 00:48:29,742
[SPEAKER_13]: It sounds like it, but the Pitch Minute show is kind of fun.

616
00:48:31,342 --> 00:48:32,523
[SPEAKER_16]: I like watching that.

617
00:48:32,543 --> 00:48:34,183
[SPEAKER_16]: Again, I don't mean any disrespect.

618
00:48:34,283 --> 00:48:36,024
[SPEAKER_16]: It's just been such a weird week.

619
00:48:36,744 --> 00:48:38,205
[SPEAKER_16]: We've been celebrating death...

620
00:48:39,181 --> 00:48:40,822
[SPEAKER_16]: I shouldn't say celebrating, but you know what I mean.

621
00:48:40,862 --> 00:48:42,403
[SPEAKER_16]: Memorializing, trying to understand.

622
00:48:42,423 --> 00:48:43,344
[SPEAKER_16]: I use that word.

623
00:48:43,364 --> 00:48:44,664
[SPEAKER_13]: It's like, who will be tomorrow?

624
00:48:44,725 --> 00:48:46,566
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, which celebrity's going to die tomorrow?

625
00:48:46,586 --> 00:48:47,726
[SPEAKER_16]: And life in the same week.

626
00:48:47,786 --> 00:48:48,907
[SPEAKER_16]: My birthday was this week.

627
00:48:49,367 --> 00:48:51,909
[SPEAKER_16]: 31 years of life that I should be lucky to have because Beth only got 24.

628
00:48:52,009 --> 00:48:53,470
[SPEAKER_16]: And, you know, I...

629
00:48:55,382 --> 00:48:55,963
[SPEAKER_16]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

630
00:49:24,224 --> 00:49:25,065
[SPEAKER_16]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

631
00:49:53,010 --> 00:49:56,472
[SPEAKER_16]: Walk in the men's room, use the restroom, then walk right out without washing your hands.

632
00:49:56,532 --> 00:49:57,692
[SPEAKER_16]: That shit needs to stop.

633
00:49:59,093 --> 00:50:01,094
[SPEAKER_16]: We need to have a little more sanitary.

634
00:50:01,334 --> 00:50:05,577
[SPEAKER_16]: We might not be able to stop disease completely, but we can sure slow it down.

635
00:50:05,597 --> 00:50:11,620
[SPEAKER_13]: And if anything, this just goes to further emphasize the point that Vegas is dirty.

636
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:13,581
[SPEAKER_13]: Very dirty.

637
00:50:13,621 --> 00:50:14,141
[SPEAKER_13]: Very dirty.

638
00:50:15,509 --> 00:50:17,049
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, well, you know, I don't know.

639
00:50:17,589 --> 00:50:18,110
[SPEAKER_16]: We're not going to know.

640
00:50:18,450 --> 00:50:25,771
[SPEAKER_16]: But here's the thing is that wash your hands, you know, after the bathroom in general, after eating and all that stuff.

641
00:50:25,851 --> 00:50:27,112
[SPEAKER_07]: Keep hand sanitizer with you.

642
00:50:28,172 --> 00:50:30,352
[SPEAKER_16]: You don't have to be crazy germ obsessive.

643
00:50:30,472 --> 00:50:34,093
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't think we need to start a frenzy, and I think that's sometimes what the media does.

644
00:50:34,453 --> 00:50:36,914
[SPEAKER_16]: But just be careful.

645
00:50:37,614 --> 00:50:38,014
[SPEAKER_16]: That's it.

646
00:50:38,874 --> 00:50:40,014
[SPEAKER_16]: Be careful and don't be lazy.

647
00:50:41,015 --> 00:50:41,555
[SPEAKER_16]: So there you go.

648
00:50:42,195 --> 00:50:42,475
[SPEAKER_16]: All right.

649
00:50:43,661 --> 00:50:47,064
[SPEAKER_16]: Anyhow, that's, I guess, that for the deep topics.

650
00:50:47,124 --> 00:50:48,985
[SPEAKER_16]: Let's get back into video games for a minute, can we?

651
00:50:49,705 --> 00:50:51,667
[SPEAKER_16]: I know, Loki, you've been awfully quiet this whole time.

652
00:50:51,687 --> 00:50:53,748
[SPEAKER_16]: Surely you've got some game stories to take us away.

653
00:50:54,909 --> 00:50:58,352
[SPEAKER_16]: I just want to say, though, again, we don't have a script tonight, so we're just going to kind of wing it tonight with the game stories.

654
00:50:58,392 --> 00:50:59,032
[SPEAKER_16]: We'll talk about things.

655
00:50:59,292 --> 00:51:01,694
[SPEAKER_16]: We'll open up the Skype line a little bit if you guys want to call in as well.

656
00:51:02,475 --> 00:51:07,218
[SPEAKER_16]: And also, housekeeping, if you want to add us on Facebook, that would be wonderful.

657
00:51:07,438 --> 00:51:08,079
[SPEAKER_16]: Orange Launch Radio.

658
00:51:09,039 --> 00:51:34,008
[SPEAKER_16]: also on Twitter we are OLR on Twitter and we like to read your tweets and you have read ours and all that fun stuff and also available on LiveJournal at Orange Lounge as well so check us out add us on the social networking sites it's a lot of fun and if you're not already in chat room and you're listening to us live on this Sunday night on All Games Radio please join us chat.org chat.org oops I almost gave the wrong chat room chat.orangeloungeradio.com there you go

659
00:51:35,163 --> 00:51:35,963
[SPEAKER_13]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

660
00:51:55,407 --> 00:51:57,008
[SPEAKER_13]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

661
00:52:13,103 --> 00:52:14,324
[SPEAKER_13]: They're testing it right now.

662
00:52:14,364 --> 00:52:23,329
[SPEAKER_13]: They're installing some kiosks into a few of their stores that are going to do used game trade-ins and also used movie trade-ins.

663
00:52:23,710 --> 00:52:34,336
[SPEAKER_13]: So you can actually trade in your games at these kiosks and then you basically get credit for whatever's in there and they give you the credit on a Best Buy card.

664
00:52:34,956 --> 00:52:36,758
[SPEAKER_13]: And you get to go spend that credit in the store.

665
00:52:37,731 --> 00:52:39,296
[SPEAKER_13]: Which I think is kind of a neat idea.

666
00:52:39,757 --> 00:52:41,261
[SPEAKER_13]: And hey, I'm all about getting...

667
00:52:44,662 --> 00:52:46,543
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, alternatives to, like, GameStop.

668
00:52:46,743 --> 00:52:58,166
[SPEAKER_13]: And you know the thing that's kind of pissed me off about GameStop lately is when you do trades, before they used to go, okay, you know, they'll scan a game, okay, that was $18, okay, here's, this is $24, and stuff like that.

669
00:52:58,266 --> 00:53:03,648
[SPEAKER_13]: Now it's just like, they have all your trades, they've already put them behind the counter, okay, you get this much store credit.

670
00:53:04,208 --> 00:53:07,629
[SPEAKER_13]: It's like, well, you know, what if that was not satisfactory to me?

671
00:53:07,669 --> 00:53:11,791
[SPEAKER_13]: What if, you know, they don't say, oh yeah, by the way, that one game was only worth 50 cents, you know, that...

672
00:53:12,871 --> 00:53:13,732
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't like how they do that.

673
00:53:13,752 --> 00:53:14,693
[SPEAKER_13]: It's kind of shady.

674
00:53:14,733 --> 00:53:17,755
[SPEAKER_13]: Every place else tells you what you're getting for each game that you trade in.

675
00:53:17,795 --> 00:53:20,157
[SPEAKER_13]: Is that just maybe the particular GameStop you're going to?

676
00:53:20,297 --> 00:53:22,739
[SPEAKER_13]: No, they've all been doing it now, so I don't know.

677
00:53:23,079 --> 00:53:27,162
[SPEAKER_13]: Maybe it's just they don't care or whatever, but they used to do that.

678
00:53:27,643 --> 00:53:32,607
[SPEAKER_13]: Now, what's kind of cool about this is when you scan it, basically it works like this.

679
00:53:32,667 --> 00:53:36,970
[SPEAKER_13]: You go to the kiosk, you scan the barcodes of the games that you have.

680
00:53:39,241 --> 00:53:43,583
[SPEAKER_13]: on the machine, and it will tell you how much it's going to give you for those games.

681
00:53:44,043 --> 00:53:47,325
[SPEAKER_13]: And you say, okay, whether to accept or deny that offer.

682
00:53:47,365 --> 00:54:04,874
[SPEAKER_13]: So if you accept it, then what you'll do is you'll pop the disc out, you'll drop the case into almost like a drop box that they have there, like a mailbox, and then the discs themselves get inserted into the machine, and it will scan them to make sure that they're readable or don't have scratches on them, or to verify that

683
00:54:05,374 --> 00:54:09,117
[SPEAKER_13]: I guess if it's an authentic game or whatever.

684
00:54:09,497 --> 00:54:09,817
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know.

685
00:54:09,837 --> 00:54:15,601
[SPEAKER_13]: The whole process, to me, doesn't seem like it would work because the read...

686
00:54:16,843 --> 00:54:21,066
[SPEAKER_13]: An Xbox 360 disc versus reading a Wii disc is completely different.

687
00:54:21,266 --> 00:54:24,828
[SPEAKER_13]: And, I mean, have you ever tried reading a Wii disc on your PC?

688
00:54:25,129 --> 00:54:25,749
[SPEAKER_13]: It doesn't work.

689
00:54:25,989 --> 00:54:27,310
[SPEAKER_13]: It's because they read them differently.

690
00:54:27,530 --> 00:54:28,671
[SPEAKER_13]: They have a different file format.

691
00:54:29,071 --> 00:54:34,035
[SPEAKER_13]: So, if it's actually physically scanning the surface of the disc, make sure there's no scratches, I guess.

692
00:54:34,415 --> 00:54:35,496
[SPEAKER_13]: Maybe that's how it's working.

693
00:54:35,896 --> 00:54:39,558
[SPEAKER_13]: There is another one, I think, that they scanned, like, a little barcode that's in the middle of the disc.

694
00:54:40,119 --> 00:54:41,460
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm not sure if that's how it's working.

695
00:54:41,600 --> 00:54:44,321
[SPEAKER_13]: But, either way, you know, to kind of get around the whole...

696
00:54:45,865 --> 00:54:46,545
[SPEAKER_13]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com

697
00:55:09,890 --> 00:55:11,771
[SPEAKER_13]: and you type in whatever billing information.

698
00:55:11,811 --> 00:55:15,674
[SPEAKER_13]: If I wanted to make myself look like Bob Barker or something like that, I could do that.

699
00:55:16,215 --> 00:55:18,096
[SPEAKER_13]: There's really no way for the system to know.

700
00:55:20,157 --> 00:55:21,518
[SPEAKER_16]: Here's what I don't understand.

701
00:55:21,778 --> 00:55:24,160
[SPEAKER_16]: Why this whole elaborate kiosk thing?

702
00:55:24,640 --> 00:55:31,305
[SPEAKER_16]: If this is the business Best Buy wants to get into, it's not like the stores are always that freaking crowded and full of people.

703
00:55:31,345 --> 00:55:35,608
[SPEAKER_16]: Why can't the service associates just scan the games and check them out the old-fashioned way?

704
00:55:35,929 --> 00:55:36,530
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know.

705
00:55:36,590 --> 00:55:44,849
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, maybe it's because they're trying to get into more of a GameStop type of business model, but at the same time, they don't want to really...

706
00:55:46,809 --> 00:55:47,850
[SPEAKER_13]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

707
00:56:06,807 --> 00:56:34,695
[SPEAKER_13]: and the same thing for these I have a feeling these are just branded E-Play machines because E-Play is also working with I want to say Walmart as well they're going to be doing the same type of thing game trading and I bet you anything they can brand their machines to look like any sort of stuff Walmart's machines are just going to say Walmart it's not going to say E-Play but I bet you these are the same machines because it sounds like the exact same thing that they're doing with Walmart

708
00:56:35,606 --> 00:56:36,467
[SPEAKER_16]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

709
00:57:00,942 --> 00:57:02,443
[SPEAKER_16]: But you know, you don't get that much for them.

710
00:57:02,463 --> 00:57:07,669
[SPEAKER_16]: I think the game I got more for than any other was Mario Party, but that's because they'd stopped making it and it was still in demand.

711
00:57:07,969 --> 00:57:10,972
[SPEAKER_13]: There's a few games that will become in high demand and stuff like that.

712
00:57:11,493 --> 00:57:17,640
[SPEAKER_13]: What I normally do, because I get some promo copies every now and then, but it's for stuff that I don't plan on playing or...

713
00:57:18,200 --> 00:57:20,261
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, I may have already picked up or whatnot.

714
00:57:20,381 --> 00:57:24,682
[SPEAKER_13]: I try to trade it in as soon as I get it because that's usually what's worth the most.

715
00:57:24,942 --> 00:57:30,424
[SPEAKER_13]: And yeah, I know I can make a lot more money selling it on eBay, but to be honest, I just don't want to go through the hassle.

716
00:57:31,104 --> 00:57:43,088
[SPEAKER_13]: And for me, it doesn't really make a difference because I'm not really losing out any money when you think about it because I'm paying nothing to get the game and any money I make from it is more money than I would have had anyways.

717
00:57:43,668 --> 00:57:43,928
[SPEAKER_13]: So...

718
00:57:45,327 --> 00:58:06,078
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know, and a lot of times, you know, store credit and stuff sits on my card forever, you know, for a very long time before I actually use it for stuff, because honestly, you know, with the situation that I have, my Wii's modded, my Xbox 360's modded, the PS3's the only thing that's not really modded, my PSP's modded, my DS is modded, I don't really have to buy games if I don't want to, I mean, that's the thing.

719
00:58:07,088 --> 00:58:12,131
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't have to buy games because I can get them through other means if I really want to play them.

720
00:58:12,471 --> 00:58:18,654
[SPEAKER_13]: But honestly, I have less time to play games now and I'm really not going to have time soon enough.

721
00:58:18,674 --> 00:58:19,815
[SPEAKER_13]: It's those baby games.

722
00:58:19,895 --> 00:58:24,177
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, exactly.

723
00:58:24,217 --> 00:58:29,620
[SPEAKER_13]: Maybe that's not a great way to look at it because I'm sure a lot of developers work hard on putting out the games.

724
00:58:29,660 --> 00:58:30,201
[SPEAKER_13]: But you know what?

725
00:58:30,241 --> 00:58:30,701
[SPEAKER_13]: It's one game.

726
00:58:30,721 --> 00:58:31,481
[SPEAKER_13]: I just don't care anymore.

727
00:58:36,909 --> 00:58:40,318
[SPEAKER_13]: And I know that's probably a bad stance on that, but...

728
00:58:40,743 --> 00:58:41,404
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't care.

729
00:58:41,464 --> 00:58:44,646
[SPEAKER_16]: I do find it interesting everybody is trying to get into this business.

730
00:58:44,706 --> 00:58:54,432
[SPEAKER_16]: It's going to be interesting to see if GameStop has to do something too and other game stores have to do something to reinvigorate their business without this competition.

731
00:58:54,532 --> 00:58:59,015
[SPEAKER_13]: I could see them maybe putting an actual kiosk out in front of their store or something like that.

732
00:58:59,396 --> 00:59:03,598
[SPEAKER_13]: Hey, look, now you can trade games while we're closed.

733
00:59:04,019 --> 00:59:09,883
[SPEAKER_13]: Or the other thing these machines are actually going to do is allow you to rent games as well.

734
00:59:10,583 --> 00:59:12,704
[SPEAKER_13]: Which, you know, they're testing that.

735
00:59:12,744 --> 00:59:13,924
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think that's a great idea.

736
00:59:14,444 --> 00:59:21,547
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, because, A, renting games, you know, especially when you can stick these kiosks, you know, like, say, in an apartment complex or something like that.

737
00:59:21,887 --> 00:59:22,587
[SPEAKER_13]: That's kind of cool.

738
00:59:22,767 --> 00:59:26,608
[SPEAKER_13]: And you can also trade movies into this, which is also pretty cool because, you know what?

739
00:59:26,708 --> 00:59:28,489
[SPEAKER_13]: GameStop doesn't take movies back anymore.

740
00:59:28,609 --> 00:59:30,710
[SPEAKER_13]: They've stopped selling movies because it didn't work for them.

741
00:59:31,250 --> 00:59:32,130
[SPEAKER_13]: So that's something else.

742
00:59:32,390 --> 00:59:38,352
[SPEAKER_13]: And what's also great about this, too, say if you have games and stuff you want to trade in, now you don't have to necessarily buy a game with it.

743
00:59:38,392 --> 00:59:39,513
[SPEAKER_13]: You can buy, you know...

744
00:59:40,273 --> 00:59:44,016
[SPEAKER_13]: Blank CD artists or an iPod or a TV.

745
00:59:44,036 --> 00:59:52,902
[SPEAKER_16]: That's one thing I do like about it is that I could see myself using this money more effectively at Best Buy just because there's more to pick from than there is at GameStop.

746
00:59:53,083 --> 01:00:03,550
[SPEAKER_13]: Or, and the other thing too, you need a gift card for Best Buy and then you go up front where they have their gift card kiosks with all these different gift cards for, say, Red Lobster or something like that.

747
01:00:03,831 --> 01:00:06,573
[SPEAKER_13]: You trade in some DVDs or whatever and now you have dinner.

748
01:00:07,461 --> 01:00:10,463
[SPEAKER_13]: So it, I don't know, there is benefits to it.

749
01:00:10,583 --> 01:00:11,704
[SPEAKER_13]: And same thing with Walmart.

750
01:00:11,724 --> 01:00:15,006
[SPEAKER_13]: Walmart's going to be doing the same type of thing where you get in-store credit.

751
01:00:15,667 --> 01:00:18,469
[SPEAKER_13]: And hey, you know, some of these super Walmarts, there's your groceries.

752
01:00:18,609 --> 01:00:20,610
[SPEAKER_13]: So I don't see it as a bad thing.

753
01:00:20,730 --> 01:00:27,135
[SPEAKER_13]: And you know what, if anything, I do like the fact that, you know, you do have that choice where you can buy stuff other than games.

754
01:00:27,155 --> 01:00:29,136
[SPEAKER_13]: Because you know what, sometimes I just don't want to buy games.

755
01:00:29,577 --> 01:00:29,737
[SPEAKER_13]: Right.

756
01:00:30,410 --> 01:00:31,211
[SPEAKER_16]: I turned off my torrents.

757
01:00:31,231 --> 01:00:31,831
[SPEAKER_16]: So I don't know, so just...

758
01:00:52,130 --> 01:00:53,631
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know, it could just be a fluke.

759
01:00:54,372 --> 01:00:58,694
[SPEAKER_16]: But there's nothing we can do here in studio, so we'll just keep doing our thing, do the show best we can.

760
01:00:59,074 --> 01:01:01,176
[SPEAKER_16]: But as far as we know, it is not on our end.

761
01:01:01,596 --> 01:01:05,278
[SPEAKER_16]: All right, so let's, I guess, move on with some more news, if we can.

762
01:01:05,538 --> 01:01:09,401
[SPEAKER_16]: DarkSakura, I know you had some things you wanted to talk about tonight, so let's make sure we get that taken care of.

763
01:01:09,421 --> 01:01:09,681
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, I did.

764
01:01:09,981 --> 01:01:12,182
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, this is just a bit of interest.

765
01:01:12,602 --> 01:01:16,665
[SPEAKER_07]: I know that there's people who are fans of the Serious Sam series,

766
01:01:17,265 --> 01:01:40,492
[SPEAKER_07]: so there's actually a PC version of Serious Sam HD that came out for Xbox Live Arcade it will be released digitally and also in shops and the console version however is not going to be out this summer so it's going to be there when it's there so that's pretty good

767
01:01:41,676 --> 01:01:42,897
[SPEAKER_13]: Serious Sam is serious.

768
01:01:42,997 --> 01:02:02,997
[SPEAKER_13]: No, I don't know, it looks kind of cool, kind of like an old school Duke Nukem type of game, and, you know, that they're actually doing something to it other than just, let's put it back out, you know, or, hey, well, Duke Nukem, I guess, Duke Nukem 3D did, like, that rewind thing, which was neat, and then I stopped playing the game, you know, that's the problem, but, uh, I don't know.

769
01:02:03,479 --> 01:02:06,180
[SPEAKER_13]: They need a new Duke Nukem game for Xbox Live.

770
01:02:06,200 --> 01:02:07,381
[SPEAKER_16]: That'd be cool.

771
01:02:07,481 --> 01:02:09,401
[SPEAKER_16]: Rumor is there might be another one in development.

772
01:02:09,782 --> 01:02:11,102
[SPEAKER_16]: Was Duke Zero or something?

773
01:02:11,382 --> 01:02:13,443
[SPEAKER_16]: Did you read that this week?

774
01:02:13,523 --> 01:02:14,403
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, I did.

775
01:02:15,464 --> 01:02:19,285
[SPEAKER_13]: My first thought was, stop ripping off subtitles for Batman.

776
01:02:20,466 --> 01:02:24,547
[SPEAKER_13]: Seriously, it was Duke Nukem Forever and then Duke Begins.

777
01:02:24,627 --> 01:02:25,448
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm like, stop.

778
01:02:25,568 --> 01:02:26,588
[SPEAKER_13]: And then Duke and Robin.

779
01:02:26,788 --> 01:02:27,168
[SPEAKER_13]: Who knew?

780
01:02:27,809 --> 01:02:28,389
[SPEAKER_16]: Exactly.

781
01:02:30,580 --> 01:02:32,602
[SPEAKER_16]: Speaking of Xbox Live, can I say this real quick?

782
01:02:32,622 --> 01:02:34,423
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm sorry, DarkSakura, but you would appreciate this.

783
01:02:34,743 --> 01:02:38,366
[SPEAKER_16]: Have you ever played Garou, Mark of the Wolves, the game that came out on Xbox Live this week?

784
01:02:38,487 --> 01:02:40,028
[SPEAKER_16]: I know you may not have played it on Xbox Live.

785
01:02:40,288 --> 01:02:41,369
[SPEAKER_16]: Have you played it in the past?

786
01:02:42,030 --> 01:02:45,232
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I think I have the PS2 version.

787
01:02:46,193 --> 01:02:47,134
[SPEAKER_16]: No, I have the Dreamcast one.

788
01:02:47,494 --> 01:02:51,197
[SPEAKER_16]: But you realize that some of the characters in this game have some really funny names, right?

789
01:02:51,457 --> 01:02:51,818
[SPEAKER_07]: Like who?

790
01:02:52,138 --> 01:02:56,922
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, okay, there's some characters, like Kim Capuan apparently had kids, and one of them is named Dong.

791
01:02:57,542 --> 01:02:59,863
[SPEAKER_16]: That's one of the characters that you can play in the game.

792
01:03:00,103 --> 01:03:04,904
[SPEAKER_16]: But then there's another character in the game, and the name of the character is... I'm looking for it here.

793
01:03:05,824 --> 01:03:08,865
[SPEAKER_16]: Kushunud Butt is the name, and that's B-U-T-T.

794
01:03:09,345 --> 01:03:13,606
[SPEAKER_16]: So you can literally play in this game Butt vs. Dong.

795
01:03:15,187 --> 01:03:17,007
[SPEAKER_16]: Or Dong vs. Butt, if you will.

796
01:03:17,408 --> 01:03:25,870
[SPEAKER_16]: And I know this is so junior high for me to say, but what kind of surprised me about this whole thing, the Butt vs. Dong, is that we still have...

797
01:03:26,994 --> 01:03:30,757
[SPEAKER_16]: This whole controversy going on about what can and can't be in your profiles.

798
01:03:31,918 --> 01:03:44,169
[SPEAKER_16]: I almost want to put in my profile Butt vs. Dong just to see if I get, you know, a temp ban or something and say, what, I was just referencing an epic Mark of the Wolves fight I had online.

799
01:03:44,990 --> 01:03:45,270
[SPEAKER_07]: Lord.

800
01:03:47,392 --> 01:03:47,932
[SPEAKER_16]: Just saying.

801
01:03:48,393 --> 01:03:49,674
[SPEAKER_16]: If you don't believe me, Go look.

802
01:03:53,732 --> 01:03:55,994
[SPEAKER_16]: I am not making this crap up.

803
01:03:56,054 --> 01:03:56,354
[SPEAKER_07]: I know.

804
01:03:57,315 --> 01:03:58,656
[SPEAKER_16]: I have the game on Dreamcast.

805
01:03:58,676 --> 01:03:59,957
[SPEAKER_16]: I saw it in Rob D's live journal.

806
01:04:00,158 --> 01:04:01,278
[SPEAKER_16]: He had a screenshot of it.

807
01:04:01,339 --> 01:04:02,660
[SPEAKER_16]: I'll give credit where credit is due.

808
01:04:02,700 --> 01:04:03,761
[SPEAKER_16]: And I just started laughing.

809
01:04:03,801 --> 01:04:04,541
[SPEAKER_16]: And I didn't believe it.

810
01:04:04,561 --> 01:04:05,822
[SPEAKER_16]: I thought it was a Photoshop thing.

811
01:04:06,163 --> 01:04:07,724
[SPEAKER_16]: Like he was trying to make a joke I didn't get.

812
01:04:08,044 --> 01:04:09,706
[SPEAKER_16]: So I looked it up on Wikipedia, like the characters.

813
01:04:09,726 --> 01:04:13,629
[SPEAKER_16]: Because as much as I love Fatal Fury, I kind of fell out of it before this game ever came out.

814
01:04:14,430 --> 01:04:16,111
[SPEAKER_16]: And I went and looked it up on Wikipedia.

815
01:04:16,151 --> 01:04:18,453
[SPEAKER_16]: And sure enough, there's a character named Butt and a character named Dong.

816
01:04:18,473 --> 01:04:19,813
[SPEAKER_07]: You need to come over.

817
01:04:20,874 --> 01:04:21,874
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, you know what?

818
01:04:21,934 --> 01:04:26,896
[SPEAKER_07]: After your dinner, let's hook up the Dreamcast and get our guru on.

819
01:04:27,656 --> 01:04:29,637
[SPEAKER_16]: My boyfriend will be so bored if he's here.

820
01:04:30,217 --> 01:04:30,577
Really?

821
01:04:31,257 --> 01:04:32,258
[SPEAKER_16]: He's not much of a gamer.

822
01:04:32,318 --> 01:04:32,718
[SPEAKER_16]: We'll see.

823
01:04:33,378 --> 01:04:34,639
[SPEAKER_16]: Why don't we watch a movie?

824
01:04:34,959 --> 01:04:36,159
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, a movie he can do.

825
01:04:36,179 --> 01:04:37,239
[SPEAKER_07]: Why don't we watch movies?

826
01:04:37,460 --> 01:04:37,960
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, we'll do that.

827
01:04:37,980 --> 01:04:39,020
[SPEAKER_16]: We'll make him watch that.

828
01:04:39,080 --> 01:04:39,860
[SPEAKER_16]: On your sexy Blu-ray.

829
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:41,761
[SPEAKER_07]: God, my TV is sexy.

830
01:04:42,461 --> 01:04:42,601
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

831
01:04:42,821 --> 01:04:43,242
[SPEAKER_16]: It'll be fun.

832
01:04:43,442 --> 01:04:44,242
[SPEAKER_16]: Sorry, more gaming news.

833
01:04:44,727 --> 01:04:46,848
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I actually do have one other little thing.

834
01:04:46,948 --> 01:04:47,128
[SPEAKER_16]: Sure.

835
01:04:49,069 --> 01:04:51,611
[SPEAKER_07]: You know how we all like to make fun of video game movies?

836
01:04:51,651 --> 01:04:53,051
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I just was talking about Silent Hill.

837
01:04:53,251 --> 01:04:54,792
[SPEAKER_07]: I love that movie.

838
01:04:55,092 --> 01:04:56,313
[SPEAKER_07]: They're doing an Uncharted movie.

839
01:04:57,774 --> 01:05:02,156
[SPEAKER_07]: It's actually being scripted by Kyle Ward, who already did Kane and Lynch.

840
01:05:03,497 --> 01:05:06,278
[SPEAKER_07]: Bruce Willis is starring in that prequel.

841
01:05:07,078 --> 01:05:10,580
[SPEAKER_07]: I like Bruce Willis, because he's aged better than Harrison Ford.

842
01:05:11,521 --> 01:05:12,581
[SPEAKER_16]: Except for Hudson Hawk.

843
01:05:12,661 --> 01:05:13,462
[SPEAKER_07]: That, no.

844
01:05:14,924 --> 01:05:15,545
[SPEAKER_07]: Moving forward.

845
01:05:17,767 --> 01:05:32,339
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's also being produced by some former Marvel people, Avi and Ari Arad, who are also producing The Lost Planet.

846
01:05:34,541 --> 01:05:37,824
[SPEAKER_07]: They were actually going to adapt Lost Planet to a film.

847
01:05:39,045 --> 01:05:41,788
[SPEAKER_07]: So, hey, that might be neat.

848
01:05:43,382 --> 01:05:44,483
[SPEAKER_07]: If they do it right.

849
01:05:45,924 --> 01:05:51,547
[SPEAKER_07]: The whole thing with this video game to movie adaptation is just it has to be done right.

850
01:05:52,548 --> 01:05:52,808
[SPEAKER_07]: You know.

851
01:05:54,089 --> 01:05:55,170
[SPEAKER_07]: We can't have, you know.

852
01:05:57,971 --> 01:06:01,674
[SPEAKER_07]: We can't have another repeat of Super Mario Bros.

853
01:06:02,791 --> 01:06:03,291
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh lord.

854
01:06:03,911 --> 01:06:05,172
[SPEAKER_16]: That's a movie I've never watched.

855
01:06:05,232 --> 01:06:07,253
[SPEAKER_16]: I just kind of refuse to watch a Mario Brothers movie.

856
01:06:07,473 --> 01:06:09,414
[SPEAKER_07]: I've seen a few minutes of it.

857
01:06:09,554 --> 01:06:11,174
[SPEAKER_16]: I've seen like a few minutes of the end.

858
01:06:11,735 --> 01:06:13,916
[SPEAKER_13]: I've heard of those funny scenes.

859
01:06:14,076 --> 01:06:15,316
[SPEAKER_13]: I thought that movie was alright.

860
01:06:15,836 --> 01:06:17,337
[SPEAKER_13]: I remember seeing it in theaters.

861
01:06:18,646 --> 01:06:19,346
[SPEAKER_13]: And you know what?

862
01:06:19,586 --> 01:06:20,106
[SPEAKER_13]: So what?

863
01:06:20,427 --> 01:06:21,907
[SPEAKER_13]: So what if the Super Mario Bros.

864
01:06:21,967 --> 01:06:23,167
[SPEAKER_13]: movie was crap?

865
01:06:23,608 --> 01:06:27,509
[SPEAKER_13]: What the hell are you going to do plot-wise with Super Mario Bros.

866
01:06:27,529 --> 01:06:27,929
[SPEAKER_13]: the movie?

867
01:06:28,009 --> 01:06:29,049
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, seriously.

868
01:06:29,450 --> 01:06:33,491
[SPEAKER_13]: There's nothing that they could have possibly done that would have made any sense.

869
01:06:33,591 --> 01:06:35,912
[SPEAKER_13]: Hell, the cartoon didn't make any sense at all.

870
01:06:36,752 --> 01:06:42,574
[SPEAKER_13]: And, you know, props for them trying to come up with an original idea, to be honest, though.

871
01:06:42,634 --> 01:06:42,834
[SPEAKER_13]: It was...

872
01:06:44,278 --> 01:06:45,439
[SPEAKER_13]: What is up with your icons?

873
01:06:59,953 --> 01:07:00,234
[SPEAKER_16]: You know what?

874
01:07:00,254 --> 01:07:03,577
[SPEAKER_16]: The default icons on our site come from some... Oh, that's a default?

875
01:07:03,677 --> 01:07:04,818
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, that's a WordPress one.

876
01:07:05,199 --> 01:07:07,481
[SPEAKER_16]: It's a user-generated site.

877
01:07:07,881 --> 01:07:09,903
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm never getting rid of my Deadpool.

878
01:07:10,284 --> 01:07:12,866
[SPEAKER_16]: Anyhow, was that it for your stories today?

879
01:07:12,886 --> 01:07:12,966
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.

880
01:07:13,307 --> 01:07:16,069
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, not for my stories, but that's all I'm going to talk about for now.

881
01:07:16,089 --> 01:07:16,350
[SPEAKER_16]: For now.

882
01:07:16,510 --> 01:07:17,991
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, then we'll come back to you later on in Part B.

883
01:07:19,312 --> 01:07:19,972
[SPEAKER_07]: Why don't we?

884
01:07:20,213 --> 01:07:23,414
[SPEAKER_16]: Alright, because we're going to take a break soon, but I want to get a few more stories out.

885
01:07:23,474 --> 01:07:25,094
[SPEAKER_16]: I know Loki's got a bunch he wants to get through.

886
01:07:25,114 --> 01:07:28,155
[SPEAKER_16]: I'll let him get one more, but let me just give you a couple quick ones here.

887
01:07:29,016 --> 01:07:33,897
[SPEAKER_16]: Of course, we were talking a lot about the celebrity deaths all are crazy around Hollywood.

888
01:07:33,957 --> 01:07:37,699
[SPEAKER_16]: If I were in Hollywood right now and on prescription medications, I would be so worried.

889
01:07:38,559 --> 01:07:39,139
[SPEAKER_16]: for what it's worth.

890
01:07:39,460 --> 01:07:46,164
[SPEAKER_16]: But hey, Michael Jackson, if you want to have something to remember Michael Jackson by, of course, we were talking about how art lives on forever.

891
01:07:46,905 --> 01:07:49,426
[SPEAKER_16]: His Thriller video is actually free right now.

892
01:07:50,727 --> 01:07:51,648
[SPEAKER_16]: Or did it just end?

893
01:07:51,888 --> 01:07:52,228
[SPEAKER_16]: It ended.

894
01:07:53,629 --> 01:07:54,910
[SPEAKER_16]: I didn't get on and get the video.

895
01:07:55,190 --> 01:07:56,291
[SPEAKER_16]: It is an epic music video.

896
01:07:56,431 --> 01:08:00,714
[SPEAKER_07]: Like I wasn't sitting in my living room when I was in second grade watching it when it aired.

897
01:08:00,734 --> 01:08:02,115
[SPEAKER_16]: When did it end?

898
01:08:02,155 --> 01:08:02,895
[SPEAKER_16]: Wasn't it just today?

899
01:08:03,115 --> 01:08:04,276
[SPEAKER_13]: It was today, I guess.

900
01:08:04,596 --> 01:08:05,457
[SPEAKER_13]: Today's not over?

901
01:08:05,757 --> 01:08:07,438
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, it's 200 Microsoft points now.

902
01:08:09,760 --> 01:08:10,701
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, it was free.

903
01:08:10,901 --> 01:08:12,082
[SPEAKER_16]: Sorry if you didn't get your hands on it.

904
01:08:12,382 --> 01:08:14,203
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I actually do remember when that aired.

905
01:08:15,344 --> 01:08:15,684
[SPEAKER_16]: I did too.

906
01:08:15,744 --> 01:08:17,285
[SPEAKER_16]: MTV used to air the whole darn thing.

907
01:08:18,066 --> 01:08:20,287
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, there was a special thing they were doing.

908
01:08:20,347 --> 01:08:23,189
[SPEAKER_07]: It was supposed to air at midnight.

909
01:08:23,429 --> 01:08:28,213
[SPEAKER_07]: I was in second grade, and my mom let me stay up to watch it when it aired at midnight.

910
01:08:29,565 --> 01:08:30,026
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Frisbee.

911
01:08:49,915 --> 01:08:51,436
[SPEAKER_16]: Final Fantasy and Mega Man

912
01:09:14,594 --> 01:09:18,815
[SPEAKER_16]: Re-release or whatever, which was the original but with some minor tweaks.

913
01:09:18,855 --> 01:09:21,696
[SPEAKER_16]: It was the one that, it's sort of like what they put out on the PSP.

914
01:09:22,096 --> 01:09:24,537
[SPEAKER_16]: But not what they put out on the PSP, I want to clarify that.

915
01:09:24,637 --> 01:09:28,278
[SPEAKER_16]: Because the one they put out on the PSP was like really, it was almost high def and stuff.

916
01:09:28,378 --> 01:09:28,578
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

917
01:09:28,598 --> 01:09:29,398
[SPEAKER_16]: That was really fancy.

918
01:09:29,438 --> 01:09:35,100
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, the one that they put, they added like some dungeons and stuff like that in the PS1 version or whatever.

919
01:09:35,720 --> 01:09:36,080
[SPEAKER_13]: But, um...

920
01:09:36,994 --> 01:09:37,274
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know.

921
01:10:03,789 --> 01:10:08,071
[SPEAKER_16]: The one they had here on PlayStation 2 and GameCube because that's when they added in 7 and 8.

922
01:10:08,731 --> 01:10:14,754
[SPEAKER_16]: So, yeah, they have 1 through 6 available on a PlayStation 1 disc, but it's now on PlayStation Network over in Japan.

923
01:10:15,074 --> 01:10:19,496
[SPEAKER_16]: So hopefully, keep your fingers and toes crossed, maybe these games will come out over here.

924
01:10:19,796 --> 01:10:20,977
[SPEAKER_16]: At least that's what people are hoping.

925
01:10:21,297 --> 01:10:22,798
[SPEAKER_16]: My thought, don't bet on it.

926
01:10:23,118 --> 01:10:24,859
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't think either of these games are going to come out in the West.

927
01:10:24,879 --> 01:10:25,519
[SPEAKER_16]: Do you want to know why?

928
01:10:25,539 --> 01:10:27,940
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't think they're going to go back and bother to retranslate them.

929
01:10:27,980 --> 01:10:28,400
[SPEAKER_16]: Why would they?

930
01:10:28,420 --> 01:10:29,061
[SPEAKER_16]: They didn't before.

931
01:10:29,761 --> 01:10:30,722
[SPEAKER_16]: Final Fantasy 1 and 2 Final Fantasy 1 and 2

932
01:10:52,213 --> 01:11:07,693
[SPEAKER_16]: So maybe those will show up on PlayStation Network, I mean that's certainly a possibility I think it would be actually kind of rad to see the 5 and 6 compilations show up Final Fantasy 6, not a Final Fantasy game that's been visited in a little while And it's one of the greatest, if not the greatest, Final Fantasy game, period

933
01:11:08,534 --> 01:11:11,216
[SPEAKER_16]: 4 is getting a lot of attention again thanks to the after years 6?

934
01:11:13,218 --> 01:11:23,545
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh my god, if they did an after years for 6 I'd be all over that Don't even tempt me I'm still all over 5 by the way I still think 5 is the best of them

935
01:11:26,547 --> 01:11:33,670
[SPEAKER_16]: GameGuru says Mega Man Anniversary Edition actually used the Rockman Complete Works versions of the NES games, so they've been translated.

936
01:11:34,190 --> 01:11:38,012
[SPEAKER_16]: Interesting perspective from GameGuru.

937
01:11:38,092 --> 01:11:38,532
[SPEAKER_16]: You know what?

938
01:11:38,652 --> 01:11:41,033
[SPEAKER_16]: If they did, it would be a pleasant surprise.

939
01:11:41,373 --> 01:11:44,414
[SPEAKER_16]: But at the same time, I do own the compilation on GameCube already.

940
01:11:44,454 --> 01:11:45,635
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't really need it.

941
01:11:46,455 --> 01:11:47,936
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, hey, you know what?

942
01:11:48,056 --> 01:11:53,918
[SPEAKER_13]: Maybe they'll move to, since they're going to be doing the digital download stuff now, maybe they're going to try to move more towards...

943
01:11:54,619 --> 01:12:03,532
[SPEAKER_13]: If they do a PlayStation 2 emulation or something like that, the full PlayStation 2 game downloads, just like they have with the PS3, at least with Burnout.

944
01:12:04,634 --> 01:12:06,737
[SPEAKER_13]: Maybe we'll see that when that happens.

945
01:12:07,984 --> 01:12:08,485
[SPEAKER_16]: Final Fantasy 1 is only $6.

946
01:12:29,520 --> 01:12:30,601
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

947
01:12:56,081 --> 01:12:56,602
[SPEAKER_16]: Mega Man in Final Fantasy!

948
01:12:56,622 --> 01:12:57,543
[SPEAKER_16]: Hey, that'd be kind of cool.

949
01:13:16,272 --> 01:13:18,073
[SPEAKER_16]: GameGuru also asked for Final Fantasy.

950
01:13:18,093 --> 01:13:19,433
[SPEAKER_16]: Is it the PlayStation 1 version?

951
01:13:19,473 --> 01:13:21,454
[SPEAKER_16]: Because Final Fantasy Origins came over here.

952
01:13:21,554 --> 01:13:23,174
[SPEAKER_16]: No, I know that, but I'm talking Final Fantasy 1.

953
01:13:25,094 --> 01:13:26,955
[SPEAKER_16]: It wasn't Origins, the 5-6 combo?

954
01:13:26,975 --> 01:13:28,935
[SPEAKER_16]: 4-5s.

955
01:13:29,375 --> 01:13:34,457
[SPEAKER_16]: No, 4 and Trigger was another thing they called Final Fantasy Chronicles, I want to say.

956
01:13:35,917 --> 01:13:37,377
[SPEAKER_16]: Forgive me if my memory is fading.

957
01:13:37,417 --> 01:13:38,738
[SPEAKER_16]: It's been many years since that came out.

958
01:13:39,198 --> 01:13:39,658
[SPEAKER_16]: But there was...

959
01:13:40,558 --> 01:13:50,464
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, there was a time that I would have hopped all over this, but I actually bought a WonderSwan color so I could play Final Fantasy.

960
01:13:50,925 --> 01:13:52,425
[SPEAKER_16]: Still no word on Mystic Quest.

961
01:13:53,986 --> 01:13:54,627
[SPEAKER_16]: Who cares?

962
01:13:56,708 --> 01:13:57,869
[SPEAKER_16]: Loki, you got anything else for us?

963
01:13:57,889 --> 01:13:59,550
[SPEAKER_16]: Maybe one more story before we go to a break tonight?

964
01:13:59,870 --> 01:14:00,651
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, sure, why not?

965
01:14:01,671 --> 01:14:02,612
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, apparently...

966
01:14:03,430 --> 01:14:04,391
[SPEAKER_13]: No More Heroes 2

967
01:14:31,432 --> 01:14:33,413
[SPEAKER_13]: and I guess you can play her whenever you want.

968
01:14:34,434 --> 01:14:46,000
[SPEAKER_13]: They're expecting that there's going to be 50 boss battles and you'll also be able to play the bosses with either character and just to mix things up and there'll be different cutscenes and stuff like that for that.

969
01:14:46,560 --> 01:14:55,465
[SPEAKER_13]: And then finally it says the primary reason that Travis is taking on the United Assassins Association again is to avenge the death of his best friend from the first game, Bishop.

970
01:14:56,249 --> 01:15:01,530
[SPEAKER_13]: Unfortunately, I didn't play through the first game enough to probably get to any of those plot points.

971
01:15:03,571 --> 01:15:08,572
[SPEAKER_13]: I want to check out the sequel, though, and probably go back to the first one at some point.

972
01:15:09,172 --> 01:15:15,753
[SPEAKER_13]: Once again, that would probably require me to somehow slow down time, which I don't think I can.

973
01:15:18,254 --> 01:15:19,314
[SPEAKER_13]: Need more hours in the day.

974
01:15:22,232 --> 01:15:23,654
[SPEAKER_16]: I see you have a whole lot of stories there.

975
01:15:23,694 --> 01:15:28,038
[SPEAKER_16]: We're going to have so much stuff for Part B. Let's do one more.

976
01:15:28,759 --> 01:15:35,325
[SPEAKER_13]: Australia has decided to block online access to games with content beyond the rating MA15.

977
01:15:36,890 --> 01:15:43,735
[SPEAKER_13]: And apparently this will apply to, I guess, console games.

978
01:15:43,956 --> 01:15:52,442
[SPEAKER_13]: It says also famous MMORPGs such as Second Life and World of Warcraft very well may be affected by this new censorship policy.

979
01:15:52,722 --> 01:15:58,426
[SPEAKER_16]: Wait a minute, I thought I heard something about this a while ago where they were talking about that World of Warcraft would not be playable in Australia or something.

980
01:15:58,867 --> 01:16:00,228
[SPEAKER_16]: Is this like a further development or something?

981
01:16:01,529 --> 01:16:02,309
[SPEAKER_16]: Maybe I'm crazy.

982
01:16:02,509 --> 01:16:04,331
[SPEAKER_16]: I thought I heard something like this before.

983
01:16:05,362 --> 01:16:11,065
[SPEAKER_16]: Sorry, I don't mean to be pooping on your story, but this sounds like we've heard something like this before.

984
01:16:11,445 --> 01:16:12,606
[SPEAKER_16]: I remember that.

985
01:16:13,466 --> 01:16:19,630
[SPEAKER_13]: They will be very well maybe affected, it says, by this new censorship policy, if it pushes through.

986
01:16:19,650 --> 01:16:29,835
[SPEAKER_13]: It says that online games exemption on content ratings is the only reason why multiplayer games with user-generated environments are possibly in this country.

987
01:16:30,575 --> 01:16:31,076
[SPEAKER_13]: Without it...

988
01:16:31,876 --> 01:16:41,298
[SPEAKER_13]: Take one game user anywhere in the world to produce objectionable content in the game environment to make the Australian government ban the game for everyone.

989
01:16:42,399 --> 01:16:44,579
[SPEAKER_13]: They're just saying that someone's going to ruin it.

990
01:16:46,160 --> 01:16:55,122
[SPEAKER_13]: But yeah, and apparently, I guess, Second Life will probably be part of that since, well, Second Life's pretty objectionable as it is.

991
01:16:57,190 --> 01:16:57,791
[SPEAKER_16]: Interesting.

992
01:16:58,311 --> 01:16:59,852
[SPEAKER_16]: I guess, why did they want to ban it?

993
01:16:59,872 --> 01:17:00,833
[SPEAKER_16]: Just because they can't control it?

994
01:17:00,873 --> 01:17:01,614
[SPEAKER_16]: They can't release it?

995
01:17:01,874 --> 01:17:17,688
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, they found out, I guess, Second Life is about to be blocked, and it says that it will be barred under the Ministry's Sinister Filtering Plan, and this is kind of going back to the whole MA-15 thing, because I guess there's adult content in Second Life.

996
01:17:18,469 --> 01:17:21,612
[SPEAKER_13]: You can choose to do sexy things, as Destructoid puts it.

997
01:17:21,672 --> 01:17:23,554
[SPEAKER_16]: Whatever, there's adult things everywhere.

998
01:17:25,018 --> 01:17:27,259
[SPEAKER_16]: That was pretty adult to me, I mean, I don't know.

999
01:17:28,240 --> 01:17:28,580
[SPEAKER_16]: Alright.

1000
01:17:29,581 --> 01:17:32,902
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, hey, before we go to break tonight, we have a couple things we want to get through.

1001
01:17:32,942 --> 01:17:47,050
[SPEAKER_16]: We've got to get to the Classic Game of the Week, but I also want to get some voicemails out of the way, because it's been forever since we've played some voicemails here on the show, and I know we had a few on the line tonight that we wanted to play, and I've got to bring up the voicemails here.

1002
01:17:48,211 --> 01:17:50,212
[SPEAKER_16]: First off, well, just listen.

1003
01:17:50,532 --> 01:18:00,229
[SPEAKER_16]: just listen to these voicemails that were left on the line these are actual phone calls to our Skype line when we're not here you can call at any time 877-GAME-OLR and leave us a message

1004
01:18:02,663 --> 01:18:03,224
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, hello.

1005
01:18:03,564 --> 01:18:05,325
[SPEAKER_02]: Is this Mr. Roberts?

1006
01:18:05,886 --> 01:18:06,406
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, hi.

1007
01:18:06,606 --> 01:18:12,791
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the Pure Dildo Factory in Washington, New York.

1008
01:18:13,412 --> 01:18:17,014
[SPEAKER_02]: We're calling in regards to your order for two dozen Big Black Fluffy Dildos.

1009
01:18:17,695 --> 01:18:22,098
[SPEAKER_02]: We're having difficulty delivering your personal batch of two dozen Big Black Fluffy Dildos.

1010
01:18:22,679 --> 01:18:23,820
[SPEAKER_02]: God damn it, Travis.

1011
01:18:27,182 --> 01:18:27,683
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

1012
01:18:28,663 --> 01:18:30,205
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

1013
01:18:32,782 --> 01:18:34,143
[SPEAKER_03]: Happy birthday, Rob!

1014
01:18:34,223 --> 01:18:36,824
[SPEAKER_03]: Happy birthday, Rob, from all of us here at USO.

1015
01:18:37,044 --> 01:18:40,386
[SPEAKER_03]: I do not condone Travis and his dildo selling.

1016
01:18:40,646 --> 01:18:40,826
[SPEAKER_04]: Why?

1017
01:18:40,886 --> 01:18:44,748
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't... That's a matter of YouTube, but happy birthday.

1018
01:18:44,788 --> 01:18:45,909
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no, no.

1019
01:18:46,029 --> 01:18:51,391
[SPEAKER_04]: Rob, we know you're missing your monthly shipment of big black dildos.

1020
01:18:51,711 --> 01:18:56,614
[SPEAKER_04]: We know you like big floppy black dildos because we know you like putting big floppy black dildos in your butt.

1021
01:18:57,134 --> 01:19:01,298
[SPEAKER_04]: So, absolutely, we know you just love having to do that.

1022
01:19:01,738 --> 01:19:10,526
[SPEAKER_04]: So, anyways, happy birthday and, you know, you might want to check FedEx for your delivery of big black floppy dildos.

1023
01:19:12,259 --> 01:19:20,784
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, thank you to our friends at Understation Live Sunday nights here on All Games Radio for leaving us that lovely little message that I'm sorry, but I find that highly offensive, you guys.

1024
01:19:20,884 --> 01:19:28,368
[SPEAKER_16]: That was a really... I'm just, like, really offended that you would go and, like, joke about that kind of stuff on your show because, like, really?

1025
01:19:29,168 --> 01:19:30,889
[SPEAKER_16]: Big, floppy black dildos?

1026
01:19:31,130 --> 01:19:31,450
[SPEAKER_16]: Really?

1027
01:19:31,870 --> 01:19:32,290
[SPEAKER_16]: Come on.

1028
01:19:32,390 --> 01:19:32,931
[SPEAKER_16]: How old are we?

1029
01:19:32,951 --> 01:19:33,091
[SPEAKER_16]: Like, 12?

1030
01:19:33,711 --> 01:19:39,574
[SPEAKER_16]: Besides, everybody should know it's big, hard black dildos, not big, floppy black dildos.

1031
01:19:39,594 --> 01:19:39,754
[SPEAKER_16]: Please.

1032
01:19:39,914 --> 01:19:40,335
[SPEAKER_16]: Please.

1033
01:19:41,274 --> 01:19:42,055
[SPEAKER_16]: Don't waste my time.

1034
01:19:43,135 --> 01:19:44,256
[SPEAKER_16]: Hey, let's go to the next voicemail.

1035
01:19:46,037 --> 01:19:46,918
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, it's Misty.

1036
01:19:46,938 --> 01:19:50,240
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I know I'm kind of late as always.

1037
01:19:51,161 --> 01:19:52,302
[SPEAKER_01]: Always with these damn things.

1038
01:19:53,062 --> 01:19:55,784
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, congrats on seven years, guys.

1039
01:19:57,145 --> 01:20:04,150
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, assuming I am off next Sunday, I damn well better be, though.

1040
01:20:06,312 --> 01:20:07,973
[SPEAKER_01]: I will have an announcement to make.

1041
01:20:09,254 --> 01:20:10,815
[SPEAKER_01]: So y'all better be fucking prepared.

1042
01:20:13,271 --> 01:20:14,712
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll go ahead and let you go.

1043
01:20:14,732 --> 01:20:16,472
[SPEAKER_01]: I gotta get ready for fucking work soon.

1044
01:20:17,012 --> 01:20:17,332
[SPEAKER_01]: Bye.

1045
01:20:19,053 --> 01:20:24,595
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, sorry to hear about your fucking work, but yeah, that's a little teaser if I've ever heard any.

1046
01:20:25,095 --> 01:20:30,617
[SPEAKER_16]: Alright, we got one more voicemail and just to be warned, I think this is another one that came in on Saturday night.

1047
01:20:30,837 --> 01:20:31,637
[SPEAKER_16]: That's all I need to say.

1048
01:20:34,025 --> 01:20:38,386
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, Billy Major with an exciting new product, Zombie Be Gone.

1049
01:20:38,626 --> 01:20:42,568
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you tired of zombies harassing you and your family at all hours of the evening?

1050
01:20:42,828 --> 01:20:44,028
[SPEAKER_04]: Try Zombie Be Gone.

1051
01:20:44,248 --> 01:20:50,150
[SPEAKER_04]: With its patented 357 Magnum technology, one shot to the head takes care of all your zombie problems.

1052
01:20:50,550 --> 01:20:51,290
[SPEAKER_04]: for only $19.99.

1053
01:20:51,350 --> 01:20:55,231
[SPEAKER_04]: Act now and we'll give you a free batch of OxyClean.

1054
01:20:55,251 --> 01:20:58,152
[SPEAKER_04]: Get out those tough zombie bloodstains with OxyClean.

1055
01:20:58,532 --> 01:21:04,573
[SPEAKER_04]: Zombie vegan, the only way to take care of zombies like me and keep Michael Jackson's skin white with OxyClean.

1056
01:21:04,913 --> 01:21:05,793
[SPEAKER_04]: Act now.

1057
01:21:07,954 --> 01:21:08,414
[SPEAKER_01]: Goodbye.

1058
01:21:10,534 --> 01:21:11,194
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.

1059
01:21:12,535 --> 01:21:14,815
[SPEAKER_16]: I guess this is how some of us cope with bad news.

1060
01:21:14,835 --> 01:21:16,736
[SPEAKER_16]: Alright, if you want to leave us a voicemail, 1-877-GAME-OLR

1061
01:21:21,440 --> 01:21:25,302
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh Travis, still up to your old shenanigans after all these years.

1062
01:21:27,783 --> 01:21:30,565
[SPEAKER_16]: Anyway, let's get to the classic game of the week, shall we?

1063
01:21:30,645 --> 01:21:37,328
[SPEAKER_16]: DarkSakura always likes to take a trip through the archives and pick a game that you kids should be checking out and playing every week.

1064
01:21:38,249 --> 01:21:42,871
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, you can play the game every week if you want, but she also gives you a new game each week that you can play.

1065
01:21:43,511 --> 01:21:46,293
[SPEAKER_16]: So here it is, DarkSakura's classic game of the week.

1066
01:21:52,102 --> 01:21:55,665
[SPEAKER_16]: So, DarkSakura, what game should the kids be playing this week?

1067
01:21:56,365 --> 01:21:58,707
[SPEAKER_07]: They should be playing Dragon Force on the Sega Saturn.

1068
01:21:59,833 --> 01:22:06,940
[SPEAKER_16]: Dragon Force is a combination real-time and turn-based strategy game.

1069
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:10,903
[SPEAKER_16]: It was actually released in America as a Working Designs translation.

1070
01:22:24,488 --> 01:22:26,129
[SPEAKER_07]: We never did get the sequel over here.

1071
01:22:26,169 --> 01:22:28,089
[SPEAKER_07]: However, I've seen the sequel and it's pretty freaking good.

1072
01:22:29,710 --> 01:22:34,932
[SPEAKER_07]: But basically, you play as one of this continent's eight rulers.

1073
01:22:35,913 --> 01:22:38,794
[SPEAKER_07]: And each ruler, of course, has a different goal.

1074
01:22:38,914 --> 01:22:40,214
[SPEAKER_07]: One wants to rule the whole thing.

1075
01:22:40,254 --> 01:22:41,615
[SPEAKER_07]: Someone wants to unite everyone.

1076
01:22:41,655 --> 01:22:43,115
[SPEAKER_07]: People want to destroy it.

1077
01:22:44,396 --> 01:22:48,978
[SPEAKER_07]: And so you move along these paths from towns to castles.

1078
01:22:49,138 --> 01:22:51,719
[SPEAKER_07]: And you want to capture the castles and then...

1079
01:22:52,677 --> 01:23:18,045
[SPEAKER_07]: you face off in battle so you have your strategy tactics where you're moving around from town to town across your map but then when you get to towns and castles you have your battle and you play as the general commanding their troops and so once you get to that part you're commanding these epic battles and it's you know you have a

1080
01:23:20,170 --> 01:23:24,972
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, an in-game week where you do administrative stuff, where you tend to your troops.

1081
01:23:25,952 --> 01:23:34,894
[SPEAKER_07]: You can increase the number of your troops, you can pay them more, you can capture enemy generals, get them to join your army, fortify castles, that type of stuff.

1082
01:23:36,355 --> 01:23:38,195
[SPEAKER_07]: But the big thing is really the epic battles.

1083
01:23:39,276 --> 01:23:39,856
[SPEAKER_07]: And, um...

1084
01:23:41,315 --> 01:23:45,878
[SPEAKER_07]: This is probably one of the greatest video games of all time.

1085
01:23:45,978 --> 01:23:50,641
[SPEAKER_07]: In fact, it won EGM's Game of the Month award in 1986.

1086
01:23:52,843 --> 01:23:56,826
[SPEAKER_07]: If you skip up just a little bit on that video, you can get to the battle.

1087
01:23:58,587 --> 01:23:59,107
[SPEAKER_07]: There you go.

1088
01:23:59,487 --> 01:24:02,249
[SPEAKER_07]: You get to see your big armies.

1089
01:24:02,389 --> 01:24:04,691
[SPEAKER_07]: And I've actually, there's battles with larger armies than that.

1090
01:24:09,366 --> 01:24:09,827
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for watching!

1091
01:24:15,802 --> 01:24:25,809
[SPEAKER_16]: It's like you really, to make this work for radio, that you kind of watch them like throwing, there's these big armies and they're kind of throwing fireballs and things like across this field.

1092
01:24:26,149 --> 01:24:31,112
[SPEAKER_16]: And you watch the TV kind of scroll through this field until it gets to the other army.

1093
01:24:31,212 --> 01:24:31,892
[SPEAKER_16]: Kind of interesting.

1094
01:24:31,993 --> 01:24:33,814
[SPEAKER_13]: It's like a side-scrolling RTS game.

1095
01:24:33,854 --> 01:24:36,055
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it's kind of, I guess is the way to describe it.

1096
01:24:36,075 --> 01:24:38,357
[SPEAKER_07]: The battles are turn-based like that.

1097
01:24:38,417 --> 01:24:41,779
[SPEAKER_07]: So you basically, as you can see in that part, now they're actually doing melee.

1098
01:24:43,462 --> 01:24:46,523
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, your goal is to capture or kill the other general.

1099
01:24:47,644 --> 01:24:54,887
[SPEAKER_07]: And so, each general can attack each other, they've got their special abilities, but you can also send your troops to overrun the other, too.

1100
01:24:55,727 --> 01:24:59,989
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, it's whether or not you want to leave yourself defended or whether or not you want to take over, you know, the other general.

1101
01:25:00,409 --> 01:25:01,610
[SPEAKER_07]: So, it's pretty neat.

1102
01:25:03,110 --> 01:25:05,491
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like you're commanding your own army.

1103
01:25:06,212 --> 01:25:08,653
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, I think they based Advance War sort of off this.

1104
01:25:10,971 --> 01:25:15,717
[SPEAKER_16]: I think a little bit, but this definitely, you know, well, A, this is more of that medieval kind of thing.

1105
01:25:16,458 --> 01:25:16,978
[SPEAKER_07]: It's epic.

1106
01:25:16,998 --> 01:25:17,759
[SPEAKER_07]: Pretty epic, yeah.

1107
01:25:17,779 --> 01:25:19,842
[SPEAKER_07]: This game is an epic game.

1108
01:25:19,862 --> 01:25:21,103
[SPEAKER_16]: Just like Dragon Force the band.

1109
01:25:22,525 --> 01:25:24,047
[SPEAKER_16]: Which, who knows, maybe that's where they got their name.

1110
01:25:25,989 --> 01:25:26,350
[SPEAKER_16]: You never know.

1111
01:25:26,724 --> 01:25:28,326
[SPEAKER_07]: Dragon Force is two words.

1112
01:25:28,346 --> 01:25:29,248
[SPEAKER_07]: Just look for Dragon Force Sega Saturn.

1113
01:25:29,268 --> 01:25:29,548
[SPEAKER_07]: You'll find it.

1114
01:25:41,868 --> 01:25:46,969
[SPEAKER_07]: Just to let you know, the Saturn version is very, very hard to find.

1115
01:25:47,169 --> 01:25:47,689
[SPEAKER_07]: Very hard to get.

1116
01:25:47,729 --> 01:25:49,229
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a working designs title.

1117
01:25:50,770 --> 01:25:51,130
[SPEAKER_07]: Good luck.

1118
01:25:52,110 --> 01:26:01,492
[SPEAKER_07]: They did do a release for it as part of the Sega Ages PS2 collection, but that version is in Japanese.

1119
01:26:02,352 --> 01:26:08,033
[SPEAKER_07]: I like that the troops rally, they yell and run into battle.

1120
01:26:08,113 --> 01:26:09,313
[SPEAKER_07]: That's pretty hardcore.

1121
01:26:10,968 --> 01:26:18,274
[SPEAKER_07]: You've got your troops falling in battle and doing their best to defend their generals, so it's pretty cool.

1122
01:26:19,115 --> 01:26:25,040
[SPEAKER_16]: So a RTS RPG action-y kind of game that's so hard to describe otherwise.

1123
01:26:25,441 --> 01:26:27,682
[SPEAKER_16]: It's very hard to find here in America, but good luck.

1124
01:26:27,783 --> 01:26:31,125
[SPEAKER_16]: Maybe you'll find something out there that's playable.

1125
01:26:31,306 --> 01:26:36,130
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, in Japan it was published by Sega, but it's a working designs release over here.

1126
01:26:37,028 --> 01:27:01,788
[SPEAKER_16]: Dragon Force is the classic game of the week and I believe that's all there is to say on that so that's going to do it for part A tonight of Orange Lounge Radio but fear not we have plenty more to get to tonight including the mailbag, the FUs of the week your calls and more gaming news and we're going to get to that all after a quick break here in studio at Orange Lounge Radio so stay tuned guys we'll be right back with more of Orange Lounge Radio

1127
01:27:07,876 --> 01:27:17,380
[SPEAKER_16]: Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio on this June the 28th of 2009 where we're celebrating our 7th anniversary of Orange Lounge Radio with nothing of particular special notice.

1128
01:27:17,700 --> 01:27:23,643
[SPEAKER_16]: We're just doing the same old crap we always do, although we got really in-depth tonight in part A, kind of having a long side discussion.

1129
01:27:24,063 --> 01:27:26,545
[SPEAKER_16]: But, you know, we're just having a really chill night.

1130
01:27:26,685 --> 01:27:30,728
[SPEAKER_16]: No pre-planned list of topics to cover tonight.

1131
01:27:30,748 --> 01:27:34,431
[SPEAKER_16]: We're just doing whatever we want to talk about tonight in the latest and greatest in gaming news.

1132
01:27:34,791 --> 01:27:36,012
[SPEAKER_16]: We'll get back into some more news.

1133
01:27:36,032 --> 01:27:38,174
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm hoping Loki has a few more stories for us.

1134
01:27:38,374 --> 01:27:40,636
[SPEAKER_16]: Maybe one more story, then I'm sure Jamie's got a couple too.

1135
01:27:41,198 --> 01:27:47,623
[SPEAKER_13]: Sorry, I'm reminiscing about the steak that I had at Daily Grill back during E3, because that was the best steak ever.

1136
01:27:47,683 --> 01:27:48,484
[SPEAKER_16]: Where's Daily Grill?

1137
01:27:48,504 --> 01:27:49,184
[SPEAKER_16]: I've not heard of that.

1138
01:27:49,405 --> 01:27:53,508
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, this was in LA, but they actually have one in San Francisco and one in Brentwood.

1139
01:27:54,008 --> 01:27:55,029
[SPEAKER_16]: Have you ever been to Ruth Chris?

1140
01:27:56,690 --> 01:27:57,471
[SPEAKER_16]: Uh, no.

1141
01:27:57,551 --> 01:27:59,433
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm telling you, that is an incredible steak.

1142
01:27:59,453 --> 01:28:00,273
[SPEAKER_16]: It's expensive.

1143
01:28:00,814 --> 01:28:02,795
[SPEAKER_16]: If you and the wife go there, you're going to spend $80.

1144
01:28:03,936 --> 01:28:06,438
[SPEAKER_16]: But it is good steak.

1145
01:28:06,959 --> 01:28:08,380
[SPEAKER_16]: That's my favorite steak right there.

1146
01:28:09,369 --> 01:28:10,189
[SPEAKER_13]: Thanks for watching!

1147
01:28:29,258 --> 01:28:34,022
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, uh, anywho, um, we've got some news.

1148
01:28:34,322 --> 01:28:37,245
[SPEAKER_13]: Let's see which we'll pick here.

1149
01:28:38,686 --> 01:28:42,109
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, how about, let's talk about how crappy home is.

1150
01:28:43,270 --> 01:28:47,794
[SPEAKER_13]: Fewer than one in three PS3 systems are connected to the PlayStation Home.

1151
01:28:48,254 --> 01:28:59,081
[SPEAKER_13]: According to Peter Edward, the director of PlayStation Home for Sony Computer Entertainment Europe, PlayStation Home has gained 7 million users worldwide, with 3 million in Europe alone.

1152
01:29:01,483 --> 01:29:07,587
[SPEAKER_13]: But, of course, with 21 million PS3 sold worldwide, that's less than one-third.

1153
01:29:09,548 --> 01:29:10,609
[SPEAKER_13]: He considers it...

1154
01:29:13,642 --> 01:29:17,264
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, he considers Home, of course, the starting point for PlayStation 3 Online.

1155
01:29:17,584 --> 01:29:21,786
[SPEAKER_13]: Of course, I would say he's a little bit biased since he is the director of PlayStation Home.

1156
01:29:21,806 --> 01:29:22,886
[SPEAKER_13]: He kind of has to say that.

1157
01:29:23,387 --> 01:29:25,668
[SPEAKER_13]: But, I don't know.

1158
01:29:25,848 --> 01:29:31,731
[SPEAKER_13]: It's just... If a lot of people are like me, they just... It's neat.

1159
01:29:32,031 --> 01:29:32,951
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a neat idea.

1160
01:29:33,111 --> 01:29:35,232
[SPEAKER_13]: But, I don't know.

1161
01:29:35,492 --> 01:29:36,373
[SPEAKER_13]: I just don't want to go...

1162
01:29:38,200 --> 01:29:41,002
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, but here's my thing.

1163
01:29:41,022 --> 01:29:49,026
[SPEAKER_16]: I realize that's how the blogs are kind of skewing this, is that, oh, nobody's on PlayStation Home, but since when was 7 million a bad number of people to have using your thing?

1164
01:29:49,066 --> 01:29:50,827
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, isn't that actually kind of good?

1165
01:29:50,847 --> 01:29:55,929
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, at risk of sounding like a Sony fanboy, is 1 in 3, in this case, really that bad?

1166
01:29:56,390 --> 01:29:58,791
[SPEAKER_16]: Because, yes, I understand Home is free.

1167
01:29:58,951 --> 01:30:02,452
[SPEAKER_16]: I guess... But think about how many people are buying their PlayStation 3s, let's be honest.

1168
01:30:02,492 --> 01:30:07,914
[SPEAKER_16]: And here's my little, you know, let's look at both sides of the coin, is that I actually think these numbers are pretty good for home.

1169
01:30:08,234 --> 01:30:11,936
[SPEAKER_16]: But the bad side is, I think there's a lot of people that are buying their PlayStation 3s just for Blu-ray players.

1170
01:30:11,996 --> 01:30:15,737
[SPEAKER_13]: I think their expectations were, though, that 100% of the people would be, you know...

1171
01:30:17,137 --> 01:30:19,279
[SPEAKER_16]: are 100% of people on Xbox Live.

1172
01:30:19,419 --> 01:30:26,382
[SPEAKER_16]: Granted, you have to pay for Xbox Live, but I would bet there's not even 100% of people that have an Xbox profile.

1173
01:30:26,942 --> 01:30:32,305
[SPEAKER_16]: I bet there's a lot of people that buy their Xbox 360 and just put the game in and play.

1174
01:30:32,325 --> 01:30:34,967
[SPEAKER_16]: You don't always have to sign into profiles and stuff to play games.

1175
01:30:36,407 --> 01:30:40,549
[SPEAKER_16]: I bet you there's a lot of folks that don't bother with all this other stuff.

1176
01:30:41,230 --> 01:30:43,371
[SPEAKER_16]: They just use their console to play games and that's it.

1177
01:30:44,392 --> 01:30:45,072
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, I suppose.

1178
01:30:45,933 --> 01:30:49,314
[SPEAKER_13]: But, you know, it's not the splash they were hoping to make.

1179
01:30:50,415 --> 01:30:53,216
[SPEAKER_16]: I just don't think 7 million is that bad of a number, I gotta say.

1180
01:30:53,916 --> 01:30:59,278
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm surprised, yeah, SSJ100Matt in our chatroom, chat.orange.radar.com says, there are 7 million PS3 owners?

1181
01:30:59,298 --> 01:31:03,860
[SPEAKER_16]: Actually, there's 21 million PS3 owners.

1182
01:31:04,200 --> 01:31:05,501
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm one of them, I think we all are.

1183
01:31:06,192 --> 01:31:08,273
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what I actually just said, all three of us had one.

1184
01:31:09,834 --> 01:31:11,815
[SPEAKER_16]: It took me a little while to get on board.

1185
01:31:13,556 --> 01:31:18,598
[SPEAKER_13]: My question, though, is this accounts or is this actually users, individual consoles?

1186
01:31:18,638 --> 01:31:21,000
[SPEAKER_13]: Because, I don't know about you, but I have four accounts on my...

1187
01:31:22,865 --> 01:31:27,989
[SPEAKER_13]: DJ Morpheus in chat says, and you many of those owners now PS3 paperweight owners or owners of an expensive Blu-ray?

1188
01:31:49,787 --> 01:31:50,528
[SPEAKER_16]: DarkSakura.com

1189
01:32:03,596 --> 01:32:04,337
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, I do.

1190
01:32:05,137 --> 01:32:06,038
[SPEAKER_07]: My feet with socks.

1191
01:32:06,198 --> 01:32:06,638
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I'm kidding.

1192
01:32:07,619 --> 01:32:15,664
[SPEAKER_07]: Speaking of PlayStation Network, actually, they want to expand the cameras through a broader online service.

1193
01:32:15,724 --> 01:32:25,331
[SPEAKER_07]: So they want to use TV, the cameras, your phones, and they're thinking of launching that around spring 2010, or at least that's their general idea.

1194
01:32:26,131 --> 01:32:30,574
[SPEAKER_07]: There was an article in Fortune about what they want to do.

1195
01:32:31,714 --> 01:32:37,878
[SPEAKER_07]: It's basically saying that they want it to be the ultimate multimedia experience.

1196
01:32:38,638 --> 01:32:41,740
[SPEAKER_07]: If you have the multiple Sony products, they're all linked together.

1197
01:32:42,600 --> 01:32:43,361
[SPEAKER_07]: Kaz Hirai

1198
01:32:45,642 --> 01:32:57,252
[SPEAKER_07]: was actually quoted saying that the service will overlay the backbone of the PlayStation Network but be broader and more open so you'd be able to download movies to TV, share photos between devices, friends.

1199
01:32:57,772 --> 01:32:59,233
[SPEAKER_07]: So basically they want to make Xbox Live.

1200
01:33:03,136 --> 01:33:04,017
[SPEAKER_16]: But I don't understand.

1201
01:33:04,097 --> 01:33:06,439
[SPEAKER_16]: What's this whole camera supposed to be?

1202
01:33:06,579 --> 01:33:07,820
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't get it.

1203
01:33:08,381 --> 01:33:10,322
[SPEAKER_07]: They're saying that it's just part of the whole thing.

1204
01:33:10,582 --> 01:33:11,083
[SPEAKER_07]: They want to...

1205
01:33:12,518 --> 01:33:16,680
[SPEAKER_07]: Incorporate all of their electronic products into this big network.

1206
01:33:17,320 --> 01:33:17,620
[SPEAKER_16]: I see.

1207
01:33:17,940 --> 01:33:19,421
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

1208
01:33:19,541 --> 01:33:21,902
[SPEAKER_16]: It's spreading around the company brand.

1209
01:33:22,042 --> 01:33:22,402
[SPEAKER_16]: Why not?

1210
01:33:22,922 --> 01:33:24,503
[SPEAKER_16]: Where do you think most of those movies come from?

1211
01:33:24,623 --> 01:33:26,224
[SPEAKER_16]: Sony Pictures, right?

1212
01:33:26,284 --> 01:33:29,505
[SPEAKER_07]: It's saying that basically they're going to start small and work from there.

1213
01:33:29,525 --> 01:33:36,728
[SPEAKER_07]: To just basically look at all the different services that function with each device and then roll out their plan.

1214
01:33:38,240 --> 01:33:50,035
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't think I would ever buy a camera on PlayStation Network, but if even only a small handful of people do, it's not that much resources to probably put this up for sale on there, so why not?

1215
01:33:50,555 --> 01:33:53,779
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what I'd actually like to see do if they're really working on networking people?

1216
01:33:53,919 --> 01:33:54,100
[SPEAKER_16]: Huh?

1217
01:33:54,713 --> 01:34:00,174
[SPEAKER_07]: is actually have a true teleconference, video conference ability.

1218
01:34:00,414 --> 01:34:02,495
[SPEAKER_16]: Can't you kind of do that with Xbox 360?

1219
01:34:02,535 --> 01:34:03,775
[SPEAKER_16]: But that's just one-to-one, right?

1220
01:34:03,795 --> 01:34:05,555
[SPEAKER_16]: You can't really do more than one camera chat?

1221
01:34:05,695 --> 01:34:08,876
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it'd be neat, though, if you could do, like, your multiple chat room.

1222
01:34:09,156 --> 01:34:09,396
[SPEAKER_16]: Hmm.

1223
01:34:10,156 --> 01:34:10,516
[SPEAKER_16]: Interesting.

1224
01:34:12,697 --> 01:34:14,277
[SPEAKER_07]: But, anyway, that's just my idea.

1225
01:34:14,437 --> 01:34:16,597
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't steal my idea, Sony, or I'll stab you in the face.

1226
01:34:17,958 --> 01:34:19,058
[SPEAKER_07]: Shove crayons down your throat.

1227
01:34:19,458 --> 01:34:19,978
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, wait a minute.

1228
01:34:19,998 --> 01:34:23,959
[SPEAKER_16]: Didn't they have the old, on PlayStation 2, wasn't there, iToyChat?

1229
01:34:25,358 --> 01:34:25,938
[SPEAKER_16]: There was.

1230
01:34:26,538 --> 01:34:27,699
[SPEAKER_16]: I didn't bother with that.

1231
01:34:27,899 --> 01:34:35,640
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, it came out so late that everyone had moved on, I think, to the next generation of gaming, and people weren't really talking about iToyChat anymore.

1232
01:34:36,261 --> 01:34:46,883
[SPEAKER_16]: I remember this was a subject of a lot of mocking early on because we could see the potential for abuse in this thing, and they had talked about moderation and all that.

1233
01:34:47,283 --> 01:34:50,584
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm wondering, whatever happened, did this game actually come out?

1234
01:34:51,895 --> 01:34:54,520
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm wondering if it didn't just get pulled before it ever came out.

1235
01:34:54,920 --> 01:34:56,543
[SPEAKER_16]: Now I gotta check it out.

1236
01:34:57,365 --> 01:34:58,406
[SPEAKER_16]: I totally gotta check it out now.

1237
01:34:59,689 --> 01:35:00,430
[SPEAKER_16]: I'll research that.

1238
01:35:00,470 --> 01:35:01,612
[SPEAKER_16]: You talk about something else, Loki.

1239
01:35:02,473 --> 01:35:03,776
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

1240
01:35:04,297 --> 01:35:04,958
[SPEAKER_13]: Let's see...

1241
01:35:06,152 --> 01:35:07,253
[SPEAKER_13]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1242
01:35:22,947 --> 01:35:23,328
[SPEAKER_13]: S, Actdeft, Drew,

1243
01:35:39,068 --> 01:35:40,269
[SPEAKER_13]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1244
01:36:04,987 --> 01:36:05,468
[SPEAKER_13]: Thanks for watching!

1245
01:36:18,528 --> 01:36:20,469
[SPEAKER_13]: and also Microsoft.

1246
01:36:20,589 --> 01:36:29,093
[SPEAKER_13]: The Pro system apparently is going to be phased out and something else will come up in its place.

1247
01:36:29,134 --> 01:36:33,256
[SPEAKER_13]: Apparently the Pro will be replaced by the 120GB Elite system.

1248
01:36:33,316 --> 01:36:37,158
[SPEAKER_13]: Now wouldn't it be awesome though if they dropped the price of the Elite to the price of the Pro system now?

1249
01:36:38,158 --> 01:36:40,359
[SPEAKER_13]: Then they may come out with something later on that's even more.

1250
01:36:40,419 --> 01:36:42,779
[SPEAKER_13]: Maybe something with Project Intel built in.

1251
01:36:43,279 --> 01:36:43,620
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know.

1252
01:36:45,200 --> 01:36:46,620
[SPEAKER_13]: Or maybe a slimmer 360.

1253
01:36:47,061 --> 01:36:47,441
[SPEAKER_13]: Who knows?

1254
01:36:47,481 --> 01:36:48,641
[SPEAKER_13]: That might be neat.

1255
01:36:49,001 --> 01:36:57,523
[SPEAKER_13]: But apparently the 120GB Elite will undergo a price cut in September.

1256
01:36:58,524 --> 01:37:00,864
[SPEAKER_13]: And there will be some new bundles coming out in October.

1257
01:37:01,705 --> 01:37:06,566
[SPEAKER_13]: That makes sense because they're releasing new bundles all the time.

1258
01:37:08,473 --> 01:37:10,494
[SPEAKER_16]: By the way, I did the research on iToyChat.

1259
01:37:11,014 --> 01:37:12,194
[SPEAKER_16]: It's kind of hard to figure it out.

1260
01:37:12,254 --> 01:37:15,135
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, if this game did come out, it kind of landed with a thud.

1261
01:37:15,775 --> 01:37:17,916
[SPEAKER_16]: It looks like it only came out in the UK.

1262
01:37:18,316 --> 01:37:22,017
[SPEAKER_16]: That's what I'm able to kind of put together here, is that it did come out in the UK in 2005.

1263
01:37:22,057 --> 01:37:25,258
[SPEAKER_16]: That must have been a long time ago we were talking about this game.

1264
01:37:25,278 --> 01:37:27,639
[SPEAKER_13]: I remember selling it, so I don't think it actually came out over here.

1265
01:37:28,259 --> 01:37:28,659
[SPEAKER_13]: Interesting.

1266
01:37:29,079 --> 01:37:31,140
[SPEAKER_13]: I do remember selling some really stupid things.

1267
01:37:32,180 --> 01:37:34,120
[SPEAKER_13]: Although iToyChat I don't think was ever one of them.

1268
01:37:34,280 --> 01:37:53,364
[SPEAKER_16]: And I just, you know, again, I hate to bring up an old subject, but iToy is what makes me nervous of things like Project Natal and these other motion controllers is that, well, especially Project Natal, not so much the Sony motion control because the Sony motion control feels to me like it's more of like a souped up Wii type thing where there's sensors in the controller itself and the camera.

1269
01:37:53,865 --> 01:37:59,686
[SPEAKER_16]: But Natal that relies apparently only on a camera, it makes me nervous because iToy was a camera too.

1270
01:37:59,946 --> 01:38:00,386
[SPEAKER_13]: It was great.

1271
01:38:00,606 --> 01:38:01,747
[SPEAKER_13]: DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen

1272
01:38:30,894 --> 01:38:35,120
[SPEAKER_13]: and Hell, we used it for our webcam for a while.

1273
01:38:37,203 --> 01:38:37,544
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know.

1274
01:38:37,684 --> 01:38:41,690
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm more confident, though, that they would test this and test this and test this.

1275
01:38:42,411 --> 01:38:46,797
[SPEAKER_13]: They're not going to just splash the market with this Project Natal and have it be shit.

1276
01:38:48,217 --> 01:38:49,038
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you for watching!

1277
01:39:04,059 --> 01:39:07,220
[SPEAKER_13]: DDR, hey, there's hands and feet mode, which sucks.

1278
01:39:07,701 --> 01:39:15,304
[SPEAKER_13]: And yet, they decide, hey, let's do Wiimote and Nunchuck mode, which, surprisingly enough, also sucks.

1279
01:39:15,964 --> 01:39:20,886
[SPEAKER_13]: And then, now there's the Wii Balance Board mode, which also sucks.

1280
01:39:21,387 --> 01:39:33,592
[SPEAKER_13]: So maybe they should go and learn their lesson from this, which is the extra modes, while an interesting idea and maybe slightly considered innovative, maybe, that's a stretch, they will always suck.

1281
01:39:35,615 --> 01:39:38,158
[SPEAKER_13]: and 8 Arrow Mode, I'm going to guess, it's going to suck.

1282
01:40:00,379 --> 01:40:01,620
[SPEAKER_16]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1283
01:40:20,920 --> 01:40:45,812
[SPEAKER_16]: well they went back through the hole that they made they climbed back up through the hole they do have surveillance tape but no sign of the criminal yet but the thing that makes this most hilarious of all they didn't walk away with a damn thing so this guy just wasted everybody's time in this case and whenever we hear about a dumb criminal I'm sure it always inspires us to get a little angsty here on the show so yeah let's do the FUs of the week

1284
01:41:03,423 --> 01:41:06,446
[SPEAKER_06]: F you to pain and heat.

1285
01:41:07,987 --> 01:41:08,747
[SPEAKER_06]: Extreme heat.

1286
01:41:10,869 --> 01:41:12,150
[SPEAKER_13]: Whoops, didn't mean to cut the music out there.

1287
01:41:12,170 --> 01:41:12,710
[SPEAKER_13]: Sorry, Loki.

1288
01:41:13,691 --> 01:41:14,992
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, it's hot.

1289
01:41:15,973 --> 01:41:17,214
[SPEAKER_13]: So if you do it, being hot.

1290
01:41:19,396 --> 01:41:21,257
[SPEAKER_16]: I would also say F you to the fact that it's hot.

1291
01:41:21,277 --> 01:41:23,179
[SPEAKER_16]: It's hotter than hell in here.

1292
01:41:23,819 --> 01:41:24,800
[SPEAKER_16]: Not in here, but out there.

1293
01:41:25,501 --> 01:41:28,163
[SPEAKER_16]: And then I would say F you as well to, um...

1294
01:41:30,428 --> 01:41:31,550
[SPEAKER_16]: I had something else on my mind.

1295
01:41:31,630 --> 01:41:33,191
[SPEAKER_16]: If you'd have gone to the doctor on my birthday.

1296
01:41:33,412 --> 01:41:33,932
[SPEAKER_16]: That's no fun.

1297
01:41:33,952 --> 01:41:35,574
[SPEAKER_16]: Who wants to go to the doctor for their birthday?

1298
01:41:37,036 --> 01:41:37,776
[SPEAKER_16]: If you'd be getting old.

1299
01:41:39,899 --> 01:41:41,901
[SPEAKER_16]: I like the age I was when I started this show.

1300
01:41:41,921 --> 01:41:41,901
24?

1301
01:41:42,381 --> 01:41:44,043
[SPEAKER_16]: I think I was then.

1302
01:41:44,063 --> 01:41:45,545
[SPEAKER_16]: 31 now.

1303
01:41:45,685 --> 01:41:45,925
[SPEAKER_16]: What?

1304
01:41:47,247 --> 01:41:48,508
[SPEAKER_07]: Things get better in your 30s.

1305
01:41:48,548 --> 01:41:49,109
[SPEAKER_07]: They really do.

1306
01:41:49,434 --> 01:41:51,075
[SPEAKER_16]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1307
01:42:13,704 --> 01:42:14,745
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh god, I have that too.

1308
01:42:14,805 --> 01:42:16,766
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, why don't we just get into release dates here.

1309
01:42:17,026 --> 01:42:20,349
[SPEAKER_16]: Tonight's just kind of a very whatever kind of show.

1310
01:42:20,369 --> 01:42:22,090
[SPEAKER_16]: Fuck it night here on Orange Lounge Radio.

1311
01:42:22,230 --> 01:42:22,550
[SPEAKER_16]: Why not?

1312
01:42:22,610 --> 01:42:24,251
[SPEAKER_16]: It's our little seventh birthday here.

1313
01:42:24,751 --> 01:42:25,772
[SPEAKER_16]: We're just screwing around tonight.

1314
01:42:26,453 --> 01:42:30,155
[SPEAKER_16]: DarkSakura's going to kick off some release dates as soon as she gets it brought up there on her monitor.

1315
01:42:30,795 --> 01:42:34,378
[SPEAKER_16]: Start off with the UK and what's coming out overseas across the pond.

1316
01:42:35,018 --> 01:42:36,640
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh yeah, it's July, isn't it?

1317
01:42:37,020 --> 01:42:37,600
[SPEAKER_07]: Or it will be.

1318
01:42:38,761 --> 01:42:42,885
[SPEAKER_07]: So let's go ahead and start off with our July releases.

1319
01:42:42,945 --> 01:42:43,605
[SPEAKER_07]: How's that sound?

1320
01:42:44,446 --> 01:42:44,706
[SPEAKER_16]: Yay.

1321
01:42:45,807 --> 01:42:48,549
[SPEAKER_07]: Ooh, God, did they actually give me any July releases on here?

1322
01:42:49,710 --> 01:42:49,930
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

1323
01:42:50,691 --> 01:42:51,992
[SPEAKER_07]: They're not listing July releases.

1324
01:42:53,433 --> 01:42:54,374
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, what good is that?

1325
01:42:56,590 --> 01:42:57,010
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, there we go.

1326
01:42:57,170 --> 01:42:57,370
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry.

1327
01:42:58,351 --> 01:42:59,571
[SPEAKER_07]: Brain broken.

1328
01:42:59,711 --> 01:42:59,971
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry.

1329
01:43:00,711 --> 01:43:02,092
[SPEAKER_16]: The heat has melted her brain.

1330
01:43:02,752 --> 01:43:03,692
[SPEAKER_07]: God, it almost did.

1331
01:43:04,012 --> 01:43:06,893
[SPEAKER_07]: On the second, we have The Punisher, No Mercy on PlayStation 3.

1332
01:43:07,853 --> 01:43:12,075
[SPEAKER_07]: We have, on the third, Call of Juarez, Bound in Blood.

1333
01:43:13,095 --> 01:43:16,576
[SPEAKER_07]: Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince on a bunch of systems.

1334
01:43:17,216 --> 01:43:18,917
[SPEAKER_07]: Street Fighter 4 on PC.

1335
01:43:20,017 --> 01:43:21,538
[SPEAKER_07]: Tiger Woods PGA Tour 10.

1336
01:43:21,818 --> 01:43:22,518
[SPEAKER_07]: And then that's it.

1337
01:43:27,691 --> 01:43:29,112
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to get some Monkey Island after that.

1338
01:43:29,712 --> 01:43:30,092
[SPEAKER_16]: Sweet.

1339
01:43:31,493 --> 01:43:38,636
[SPEAKER_16]: Let's get into some Japanese release dates and see what's coming out on the other side of the pond over across the Pacific.

1340
01:43:39,736 --> 01:43:45,499
[SPEAKER_16]: Only some price cuts on the Xbox 360 this week for Bioshock, Infinite Undiscovery, and Shin's Sengoku Musou 5.

1341
01:43:46,319 --> 01:43:50,601
[SPEAKER_16]: All getting price cuts this week, which I believe that last one was Dynasty Warriors, if I'm not mistaken.

1342
01:43:52,342 --> 01:43:54,383
[SPEAKER_16]: Dynasty Warriors 5 Empires 6 Empires

1343
01:44:11,896 --> 01:44:18,901
[SPEAKER_16]: Looks to be a pretty slow week over there in Japan, but if you are still a fan of the PlayStation 2, I got nothing for you this week.

1344
01:44:18,941 --> 01:44:21,102
[SPEAKER_16]: But there's a baseball game coming out next week, you can look for that.

1345
01:44:22,403 --> 01:44:28,207
[SPEAKER_16]: Coming out on the Nintendo DS, we have Mina no Oikake Yasan.

1346
01:44:28,667 --> 01:44:33,890
[SPEAKER_16]: So it must be some type of drawing game, because I recognize the oikake from being that whole drawing on the internet thing.

1347
01:44:34,250 --> 01:44:38,033
[SPEAKER_16]: That looks to be exactly what this is, probably some type of share with your friends drawing game.

1348
01:44:38,653 --> 01:44:40,535
[SPEAKER_07]: Draw a penis on the internet!

1349
01:44:53,849 --> 01:44:54,970
[SPEAKER_16]: Hatsune Miku Project Diva Vocaloid

1350
01:45:13,359 --> 01:45:18,623
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, you input the words, the tune and everything, and then she sings it.

1351
01:45:18,863 --> 01:45:22,245
[SPEAKER_16]: This looks to be a type of music game, actually, coming out of there.

1352
01:45:22,285 --> 01:45:24,507
[SPEAKER_07]: Seriously, what's it on?

1353
01:45:25,328 --> 01:45:25,728
[SPEAKER_16]: PSP.

1354
01:45:26,348 --> 01:45:28,910
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, having a Vocaloid game on PSP is pretty cool.

1355
01:45:29,431 --> 01:45:31,652
[SPEAKER_07]: Rob, really, I'm going to find you something to play.

1356
01:45:32,053 --> 01:45:32,473
[SPEAKER_16]: Interesting.

1357
01:45:32,493 --> 01:45:41,140
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, you actually kind of, this is a rhythm game that you put in these, kind of another type of syncing game, and it makes her dance.

1358
01:45:42,051 --> 01:45:46,335
[SPEAKER_16]: Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince SteamBot Chronicles Battle Tournament

1359
01:46:04,714 --> 01:46:10,496
[SPEAKER_13]: Street Fighter 4 on PC, Mega Man Star Force 3, Red Joker, Black Ace, Ice Age, Dawn of the Dinosaur

1360
01:46:23,374 --> 01:46:35,204
[SPEAKER_13]: and Grand Theft Auto 3, Vice City and San Andreas are all coming together in a brand new PC trilogy that's being re-released.

1361
01:46:35,765 --> 01:46:39,769
[SPEAKER_13]: Calawara is Bound in Blood on PS3 and Xbox 360.

1362
01:46:40,870 --> 01:46:45,414
[SPEAKER_13]: Treasure World, which is a DS game that uses your Wi-Fi signals to find treasure.

1363
01:46:46,616 --> 01:46:48,398
[SPEAKER_13]: Rugu Twisted Towers Rugu Twisted Towers

1364
01:47:01,830 --> 01:47:08,954
[SPEAKER_13]: BlazBlue, Calamity Trigger, sort of a launch limited edition coming out on PS3 and Xbox 360 as well.

1365
01:47:12,076 --> 01:47:12,856
[SPEAKER_13]: Let's see.

1366
01:47:13,577 --> 01:47:21,341
[SPEAKER_13]: And then a smaller 360 game that not a lot of people have heard about, Infernal, Hell's Vengeance, which was on PC a little bit earlier this year.

1367
01:47:22,142 --> 01:47:25,163
[SPEAKER_13]: That's making its way out to Xbox 360 at a budget $39.99.

1368
01:47:26,504 --> 01:47:29,866
[SPEAKER_13]: I guess that's not really too budget, but more budget than full price.

1369
01:47:30,707 --> 01:47:49,883
[SPEAKER_13]: Rugu Attack which is on the DS also another Rugu sequel and then that's it for this week but I'm kind of happy to see Arma 2 is coming out next week and I still haven't gotten a chance to play the actual Steam version but it looks cool

1370
01:47:51,468 --> 01:47:53,751
[SPEAKER_16]: Alright, so backing up to the Japanese release dates a little bit.

1371
01:47:53,771 --> 01:47:55,193
[SPEAKER_16]: DarkSakura, you sent me this YouTube.

1372
01:47:55,253 --> 01:47:56,695
[SPEAKER_16]: What the hell is this I'm about to look at here?

1373
01:47:56,835 --> 01:48:00,060
[SPEAKER_07]: This is what the Vocaloid is like.

1374
01:48:01,301 --> 01:48:01,982
[SPEAKER_07]: You want to turn it up?

1375
01:48:02,203 --> 01:48:02,303
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh.

1376
01:48:04,590 --> 01:48:12,972
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just some really weird version of Don't Worry Be Happy.

1377
01:48:13,472 --> 01:48:22,735
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I picked something in English, but you input the words and the tune and everything, and it plays it back like she's singing, she's your virtual idol.

1378
01:48:24,256 --> 01:48:25,116
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, interesting.

1379
01:48:25,156 --> 01:48:27,257
[SPEAKER_16]: So you're actually pushing the buttons to sing?

1380
01:48:27,737 --> 01:48:31,819
[SPEAKER_07]: No, you just input everything ahead of time and then watch it play through.

1381
01:48:32,159 --> 01:48:33,080
[SPEAKER_16]: Uh-oh.

1382
01:48:34,060 --> 01:48:36,942
[SPEAKER_07]: If there's one of her doing Carameldansen, I'll find it.

1383
01:48:37,342 --> 01:48:38,503
[SPEAKER_16]: No thank you, that's alright.

1384
01:48:39,283 --> 01:48:41,824
[SPEAKER_16]: But I think that that's... So this is more of a music maker.

1385
01:48:42,605 --> 01:48:44,025
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, the PC ones are.

1386
01:48:44,085 --> 01:48:53,490
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know exactly how the PSP one is going to be, but ever since the first one came out, there's been a ton of new vocaloids and everything.

1387
01:48:53,650 --> 01:48:54,090
[SPEAKER_07]: It's pretty big.

1388
01:48:59,837 --> 01:49:02,278
[SPEAKER_16]: I think this is what a DarkSakura wants me to show.

1389
01:49:02,398 --> 01:49:05,959
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that's an animation that someone did.

1390
01:49:06,059 --> 01:49:09,561
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, let's get back into some more news.

1391
01:49:09,581 --> 01:49:11,521
Loki, you got anything for us?

1392
01:49:23,973 --> 01:49:25,153
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, sure, why not?

1393
01:49:25,774 --> 01:49:41,519
[SPEAKER_13]: Apparently, EA is calling their Sims 3 leak its demo program, saying that, you know, you've identified our secret marketing campaign, EA CEO John... I'm not even going to try to pronounce his last name.

1394
01:49:42,280 --> 01:49:43,440
[SPEAKER_13]: Riccitello, I guess.

1395
01:49:43,460 --> 01:49:44,160
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know.

1396
01:49:44,540 --> 01:49:45,901
[SPEAKER_16]: That was actually pretty accurate.

1397
01:49:46,212 --> 01:49:55,416
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, it's a form of large-scale piracy, I guess, was a pre-release version of The Sims 3.

1398
01:49:56,697 --> 01:50:07,422
[SPEAKER_13]: Basically saying that it was a way to figure out some data and stuff from this experiment.

1399
01:50:08,443 --> 01:50:14,006
[SPEAKER_13]: They've gotten a lot of people to buy the game based on trying this version of the game that leaked out, I guess.

1400
01:50:15,322 --> 01:50:15,742
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know.

1401
01:50:15,762 --> 01:50:16,803
[SPEAKER_13]: That didn't fix any problems.

1402
01:50:16,843 --> 01:50:16,883
[SPEAKER_13]: So...

1403
01:50:44,560 --> 01:50:53,567
[SPEAKER_13]: I think it sounds to me like they're making excuses because a leak like this had to have come from inside since it was leaked out weeks early.

1404
01:50:54,848 --> 01:50:59,492
[SPEAKER_07]: He's doing a cover your ass and it just makes him sound pathetic.

1405
01:51:01,714 --> 01:51:05,297
[SPEAKER_13]: So, well, hey, whatever makes you sleep better at night, I guess.

1406
01:51:07,785 --> 01:51:12,331
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, it kind of sounds more like, oops, how do we explain this one or something?

1407
01:51:12,351 --> 01:51:14,413
[SPEAKER_16]: Ha ha ha, he fell for it.

1408
01:51:14,734 --> 01:51:22,323
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, I think what he's saying also, too, is what they're going to try to move towards later on is selling more services and

1409
01:51:22,583 --> 01:51:23,525
[SPEAKER_13]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1410
01:51:38,806 --> 01:51:42,888
[SPEAKER_13]: At the end of the day, what's going to end up happening... Except they'll probably not sell a lot of that.

1411
01:51:43,028 --> 01:51:44,749
[SPEAKER_13]: And you know what else is going to happen at the end of the day?

1412
01:51:45,189 --> 01:51:48,351
[SPEAKER_13]: Just like all the expansions for Sims 2, those will get leaked out as well.

1413
01:51:48,451 --> 01:51:53,213
[SPEAKER_13]: So all your plans for download content, it's not going to work.

1414
01:51:54,212 --> 01:52:20,262
[SPEAKER_07]: just to say also everything that's available on the Sims 3 store is available for download through BitTorrent people have already done it people are already doing it's just really starting but people are already starting to do a few custom items already it's not going to be too much longer you can download everything that's there in the store

1415
01:52:21,189 --> 01:52:23,991
[SPEAKER_16]: But if you really like the game, you should just go buy it.

1416
01:52:24,852 --> 01:52:25,552
[SPEAKER_07]: I bought my game.

1417
01:52:25,672 --> 01:52:26,713
[SPEAKER_16]: Encourage them to make a Sims 4.

1418
01:52:26,753 --> 01:52:28,794
[SPEAKER_16]: If you really, really like the Sims.

1419
01:52:29,054 --> 01:52:31,696
[SPEAKER_16]: Although Sims 4 is probably inevitable someday.

1420
01:52:32,157 --> 01:52:32,917
[SPEAKER_16]: Many years down the line.

1421
01:52:32,957 --> 01:52:34,778
[SPEAKER_07]: I just want a nice graphical upgrade to Sims 2.

1422
01:52:36,119 --> 01:52:37,861
[SPEAKER_16]: Sequels a successful franchise?

1423
01:52:37,961 --> 01:52:38,141
[SPEAKER_16]: No.

1424
01:52:39,810 --> 01:52:45,333
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, speaking of sequels to successful franchises... I want them to make pretty faces and better hair.

1425
01:52:45,413 --> 01:52:48,075
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, I want pretty faces and better hair in Final Fantasy XI.

1426
01:52:48,115 --> 01:52:49,735
[SPEAKER_16]: It might actually make me play that game again.

1427
01:52:50,216 --> 01:52:50,716
[SPEAKER_16]: No, not really.

1428
01:52:50,756 --> 01:52:52,317
[SPEAKER_16]: Not with Final Fantasy XIV on the horizon.

1429
01:52:52,617 --> 01:52:55,439
[SPEAKER_16]: But Final Fantasy XI's been getting some crap this week.

1430
01:52:55,779 --> 01:52:58,240
[SPEAKER_16]: Apparently, they got sued this week for $5 million.

1431
01:52:58,600 --> 01:53:04,023
[SPEAKER_16]: Apparently, it's because they supposedly, allegedly, I guess is the word to use, they...

1432
01:53:05,424 --> 01:53:06,105
[SPEAKER_16]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1433
01:53:28,621 --> 01:53:33,282
[SPEAKER_16]: Deceptive advertising, unfair and undisclosed business practices Licensing of the online game software disguised as a sale

1434
01:53:45,626 --> 01:54:04,925
[SPEAKER_16]: monthly fees or fees to play the online games penalties for late payment of the fees interest charges for late payment of the fees charges while the online game account is suspended termination of the right to use the online games for late payment of the fees user restrictions and conditions related to the online games termination of game data for payment of the fees

1435
01:54:05,848 --> 01:54:07,529
[SPEAKER_13]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1436
01:54:31,101 --> 01:54:32,523
[SPEAKER_07]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1437
01:54:49,163 --> 01:54:56,749
[SPEAKER_07]: and in your agreement it says that you are paying for this, this, and this, that your lender has the right to charge this, this, and this if you don't do shit.

1438
01:54:57,230 --> 01:54:57,650
[SPEAKER_07]: Guess what?

1439
01:54:57,710 --> 01:54:58,971
[SPEAKER_07]: Same way in that type of contract.

1440
01:54:59,411 --> 01:55:00,952
[SPEAKER_07]: You have to read it.

1441
01:55:01,273 --> 01:55:02,734
[SPEAKER_07]: This person has no right to sue.

1442
01:55:02,774 --> 01:55:05,296
[SPEAKER_07]: She's completely responsible for her own peace.

1443
01:55:05,316 --> 01:55:09,419
[SPEAKER_13]: And they even ask you when you're signing up, be sure to read this contract.

1444
01:55:09,439 --> 01:55:13,062
[SPEAKER_13]: Do you accept these terms and whatever?

1445
01:55:13,082 --> 01:55:13,162
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

1446
01:55:14,103 --> 01:55:15,564
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not their fault she didn't read it.

1447
01:55:15,664 --> 01:55:16,745
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, this is what I don't understand.

1448
01:55:16,825 --> 01:55:18,346
[SPEAKER_16]: I played this game for three years.

1449
01:55:19,027 --> 01:55:21,950
[SPEAKER_16]: I had never heard of them charging interest.

1450
01:55:22,770 --> 01:55:25,693
[SPEAKER_16]: Not a single person in my link shell ever talked about this.

1451
01:55:25,853 --> 01:55:28,315
[SPEAKER_13]: It's for late payments, I guess.

1452
01:55:28,996 --> 01:55:31,999
[SPEAKER_16]: But if you pay late, there's no paying late.

1453
01:55:32,299 --> 01:55:34,281
[SPEAKER_16]: You pay late because they disable your account.

1454
01:55:34,681 --> 01:55:35,322
[SPEAKER_16]: You auto-pay.

1455
01:55:35,742 --> 01:55:38,765
[SPEAKER_16]: Right, and if your credit card bounces or whatever, you can't log in.

1456
01:55:39,568 --> 01:55:41,049
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, but, like, I don't know.

1457
01:55:41,830 --> 01:55:44,632
[SPEAKER_13]: Do they charge you before the month is up?

1458
01:55:44,652 --> 01:55:46,594
[SPEAKER_13]: Say, like, I pay for a month or whatever like that.

1459
01:55:46,954 --> 01:55:48,395
[SPEAKER_13]: They charge me at the beginning or the end of the month.

1460
01:55:48,415 --> 01:55:53,620
[SPEAKER_13]: Because if they charge me at the end of the month, then, you know, you've paid for that month and you owe them money, I guess, for that.

1461
01:55:54,160 --> 01:55:54,440
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know.

1462
01:55:54,460 --> 01:55:55,982
[SPEAKER_13]: I think the beginning of the month makes sense.

1463
01:55:56,522 --> 01:55:57,303
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't understand.

1464
01:55:57,363 --> 01:55:59,845
[SPEAKER_13]: I think we need to hear more about what specifically this lawsuit is about.

1465
01:55:59,885 --> 01:56:02,227
[SPEAKER_16]: Because the way it's worded, it makes it sound like a dummy.

1466
01:56:02,347 --> 01:56:03,868
[SPEAKER_13]: And on top of all that, $5 million?

1467
01:56:03,888 --> 01:56:04,188
[SPEAKER_13]: Really?

1468
01:56:04,589 --> 01:56:04,709
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

1469
01:56:06,089 --> 01:56:09,235
[SPEAKER_13]: For something that sounds like they just fucked up and didn't pay their bill.

1470
01:56:09,255 --> 01:56:10,898
[SPEAKER_13]: The customer service could have just resolved.

1471
01:56:11,419 --> 01:56:13,463
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, maybe that's the problem.

1472
01:56:14,901 --> 01:56:16,422
[SPEAKER_16]: But, you know, I don't know.

1473
01:56:16,462 --> 01:56:18,664
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, $5 million is a little extreme.

1474
01:56:18,864 --> 01:56:22,446
[SPEAKER_16]: But, I mean, if it's being split among 100,000 people, because it's class action, right?

1475
01:56:23,307 --> 01:56:25,989
[SPEAKER_16]: So, technically, all 100,000 should be entitled to their chunk of it.

1476
01:56:26,029 --> 01:56:27,510
[SPEAKER_16]: So, they all get, what, 50 bucks a pop?

1477
01:56:27,530 --> 01:56:27,510
5,000.

1478
01:56:28,010 --> 01:56:29,651
[SPEAKER_16]: Is it that much?

1479
01:56:30,011 --> 01:56:30,672
[SPEAKER_16]: I can't do math.

1480
01:56:30,712 --> 01:56:30,932
[SPEAKER_16]: Sorry.

1481
01:56:31,432 --> 01:56:31,632
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.

1482
01:56:31,873 --> 01:56:32,273
[SPEAKER_16]: But still.

1483
01:56:33,033 --> 01:56:33,614
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, wait.

1484
01:56:33,754 --> 01:56:35,155
[SPEAKER_16]: I think it's still frivolous.

1485
01:56:35,175 --> 01:56:35,375
[SPEAKER_16]: 50 times 100,000.

1486
01:56:36,015 --> 01:56:37,537
[SPEAKER_16]: I think it's still highly frivolous.

1487
01:56:38,017 --> 01:56:39,018
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, it's still a 50 bucks.

1488
01:56:39,038 --> 01:56:39,638
[SPEAKER_13]: That's, you know.

1489
01:56:41,249 --> 01:56:44,611
[SPEAKER_13]: And they're not going to get $50 either because lawyers got to get paid.

1490
01:57:07,785 --> 01:57:08,426
[SPEAKER_16]: How about the mailbag?

1491
01:57:28,069 --> 01:57:28,709
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know, it's um...

1492
01:57:44,946 --> 01:57:45,706
[SPEAKER_13]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1493
01:58:12,380 --> 01:58:16,703
[SPEAKER_16]: This has got to be one of those theaters that only seats 20 people in it.

1494
01:58:16,943 --> 01:58:19,665
[SPEAKER_16]: It's a real tiny, tiny community theater.

1495
01:58:19,685 --> 01:58:22,647
[SPEAKER_16]: I can't imagine this is a big production.

1496
01:58:24,048 --> 01:58:36,676
[SPEAKER_13]: The gameplay celebration is apparently three performances executed through video games in video game styles, three game party nights, and three weeks of rot-your-brain video game madness.

1497
01:58:37,556 --> 01:58:52,707
[SPEAKER_13]: And apparently their video game party nights include an MMORPG night where you will play your favorite massively multiplayer online role-playing game in a theater, rock band karaoke, and then another night will be a chiptunes dance party.

1498
01:58:53,668 --> 01:58:54,288
[SPEAKER_16]: That sounds fun.

1499
01:58:55,409 --> 01:58:58,051
[SPEAKER_16]: But this sounds so off-Broadway, it's like in New Jersey.

1500
01:58:58,191 --> 01:59:06,176
[SPEAKER_13]: What's kind of neat, though, is what they have, it's live actors on a stage with no set work, and then the sets are actually like...

1501
01:59:07,122 --> 01:59:09,525
[SPEAKER_13]: Artwork from Adventure Games, which is kind of neat.

1502
01:59:10,145 --> 01:59:11,267
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, that's kind of neat, I guess.

1503
01:59:12,428 --> 01:59:15,571
[SPEAKER_16]: What a bunch of nerds, but I can applaud them.

1504
01:59:15,812 --> 01:59:19,476
[SPEAKER_13]: And they actually, it's kind of cool, they've got a little score tally running.

1505
01:59:19,576 --> 01:59:20,116
[SPEAKER_13]: Nice.

1506
01:59:23,089 --> 01:59:24,471
[SPEAKER_16]: Alright, are we ready for some emails?

1507
01:59:24,911 --> 01:59:25,412
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1508
01:59:25,432 --> 01:59:29,817
[SPEAKER_16]: Alright, whenever you want to interact with the show, Mailbag at OrangeLaunchRadio.com is a great place to do it.

1509
01:59:30,197 --> 01:59:32,520
[SPEAKER_16]: We jump in there and read some of your emails every week.

1510
01:59:32,580 --> 01:59:37,606
[SPEAKER_16]: The lovely DarkSakura is going to dive in the mailbag head first and see what mails come up for her to read tonight.

1511
01:59:37,626 --> 01:59:38,807
[SPEAKER_16]: Don't forget the hazmat suit, Rob.

1512
01:59:39,027 --> 01:59:40,769
[SPEAKER_16]: Mailbag at OrangeLaunchRadio.com

1513
01:59:47,745 --> 01:59:55,029
[SPEAKER_07]: First email, I just listened to last week's show and I would compare it more to Doom and the start of the first person shooter genre.

1514
01:59:55,069 --> 01:59:57,031
[SPEAKER_07]: It's about BB&A vs. DJ Hero.

1515
01:59:57,591 --> 02:00:07,217
[SPEAKER_07]: When a new game genre first appears to the general public, it seems like the best way to classify it is by calling it a clone of the first or most popular game in the genre.

1516
02:00:07,617 --> 02:00:12,820
[SPEAKER_07]: For a more recent example, look at how sandbox games were called GTA clones until a few years ago.

1517
02:00:13,480 --> 02:00:17,162
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's from Corky842, who also sends an addendum.

1518
02:00:17,562 --> 02:00:17,942
[SPEAKER_07]: P.S.

1519
02:00:18,162 --> 02:00:20,683
[SPEAKER_07]: The last email was brought to you by Beer in the Palm Pre.

1520
02:00:23,484 --> 02:00:24,225
[SPEAKER_16]: Wow.

1521
02:00:24,985 --> 02:00:26,606
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know if I have a lot else to add to that.

1522
02:00:27,006 --> 02:00:28,306
[SPEAKER_16]: That's an interesting comparison.

1523
02:00:28,466 --> 02:00:33,508
[SPEAKER_16]: I didn't even think of the Doom, like the whole Doom, Quake, Wolfenstein type of connection last week.

1524
02:00:34,209 --> 02:00:35,129
[SPEAKER_16]: But very interesting point.

1525
02:00:36,810 --> 02:00:38,490
[SPEAKER_07]: Cheeseburger says, I miss MJ.

1526
02:00:38,670 --> 02:00:39,491
[SPEAKER_07]: Dude, you're too young.

1527
02:00:43,684 --> 02:00:45,415
[SPEAKER_07]: um, this one, um

1528
02:00:47,599 --> 02:00:51,381
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey y'all, I downloaded the new iPod Touch firmware tonight.

1529
02:00:51,441 --> 02:00:53,723
[SPEAKER_07]: First of all, I paid $10 for this.

1530
02:00:53,843 --> 02:00:54,143
[SPEAKER_07]: Why?

1531
02:00:54,763 --> 02:00:58,245
[SPEAKER_07]: Is this really good, or am I an Apple lemming, or both?

1532
02:00:58,866 --> 02:01:00,907
[SPEAKER_07]: Second, this update actually looks interesting.

1533
02:01:00,967 --> 02:01:05,569
[SPEAKER_07]: The copy and paste is not really what I'm used to, but what was I expecting?

1534
02:01:05,630 --> 02:01:07,951
[SPEAKER_07]: Parental controls are good, if you're a parent.

1535
02:01:08,611 --> 02:01:10,152
[SPEAKER_07]: As I am not, it's useless to me.

1536
02:01:10,792 --> 02:01:16,936
[SPEAKER_07]: The shake-to-shuffle feature is nice, though, and really useful when my baby's crying album kicks in.

1537
02:01:18,228 --> 02:01:23,012
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, that's awesome for Apple to charge for firmware updates.

1538
02:01:23,413 --> 02:01:24,334
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't pay for mine.

1539
02:01:27,377 --> 02:01:28,317
[SPEAKER_16]: You don't pay on the phones.

1540
02:01:28,337 --> 02:01:30,439
[SPEAKER_16]: You only pay on the iTouch or whatever.

1541
02:01:30,499 --> 02:01:31,700
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, how generous of them.

1542
02:01:31,801 --> 02:01:32,061
[SPEAKER_16]: I know.

1543
02:01:36,032 --> 02:01:38,995
[SPEAKER_07]: 3.

1544
02:01:36,192 --> 02:01:38,995
[SPEAKER_07]: Assuming you didn't cut me off with the baby comment.

1545
02:01:39,715 --> 02:01:42,418
[SPEAKER_07]: They've done something to improve typing messages and I love them for it.

1546
02:01:42,578 --> 02:01:47,902
[SPEAKER_07]: Landscape typing makes the buttons noticeably bigger, an improvement that helps me a lot.

1547
02:01:48,263 --> 02:01:49,864
[SPEAKER_07]: Now I don't mistype every other word.

1548
02:01:50,044 --> 02:01:50,445
[SPEAKER_07]: Yay!

1549
02:01:51,025 --> 02:01:52,266
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, that's all for now.

1550
02:01:52,807 --> 02:01:53,507
[SPEAKER_07]: Stay care.

1551
02:01:54,909 --> 02:01:59,476
[SPEAKER_07]: Redertainment This message was typed on iPod Touch, which I have and you don't.

1552
02:02:01,840 --> 02:02:04,845
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, I do really like the upgrade.

1553
02:02:04,925 --> 02:02:09,112
[SPEAKER_07]: I like having five panels for my apps instead of the three.

1554
02:02:10,778 --> 02:02:13,260
[SPEAKER_07]: and I'm pretty pleased with it.

1555
02:02:13,700 --> 02:02:14,941
[SPEAKER_07]: Pretty pleased.

1556
02:02:15,181 --> 02:02:19,365
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, I really like some of the changes that they've made to the contacts.

1557
02:02:19,385 --> 02:02:19,825
[SPEAKER_07]: It's okay.

1558
02:02:19,845 --> 02:02:21,606
[SPEAKER_16]: I like that I can text and landscape now.

1559
02:02:21,786 --> 02:02:23,468
[SPEAKER_16]: That's the biggest improvement.

1560
02:02:23,508 --> 02:02:24,128
[SPEAKER_16]: Same with email.

1561
02:02:24,508 --> 02:02:27,491
[SPEAKER_16]: But I'm not liking the fact that the phone just seems to run slower.

1562
02:02:28,011 --> 02:02:31,294
[SPEAKER_16]: I guess with all that stuff in there, a lot of my apps feel like they're running slower.

1563
02:02:32,254 --> 02:02:34,094
[SPEAKER_07]: Mine are showing an improvement.

1564
02:02:34,675 --> 02:02:41,596
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm hoping that with the 3.1 that's inevitable at some point, you know, the minor tweaks, that'll fix that all up.

1565
02:02:41,996 --> 02:02:42,516
[SPEAKER_16]: That's what I hope.

1566
02:02:43,416 --> 02:02:43,976
[SPEAKER_07]: Next email?

1567
02:02:44,897 --> 02:02:45,077
[SPEAKER_16]: Sure.

1568
02:02:45,617 --> 02:02:52,078
[SPEAKER_07]: Dear OLR Crew, I just wanted to briefly chime in on something you went over last week, that being Guitar Hero Van Halen.

1569
02:02:52,478 --> 02:02:55,879
[SPEAKER_07]: I remember when they announced the game, I was actually somewhat interested.

1570
02:02:57,617 --> 02:03:14,777
[SPEAKER_07]: I love Sammy Hagar Most of the music by them that I love is when Sammy Hagar was the lead singer There's only a couple of songs that I enjoyed that were when David Lee Roth was singing with the group

1571
02:03:15,798 --> 02:03:17,659
[SPEAKER_07]: I completely agree with this, by the way.

1572
02:03:18,800 --> 02:03:22,722
[SPEAKER_07]: So I suppose that in the opinion of many, I'm not a true fan of the group.

1573
02:03:23,362 --> 02:03:25,143
[SPEAKER_07]: That is just my own musical taste.

1574
02:03:25,663 --> 02:03:29,185
[SPEAKER_07]: Perhaps now there might be an opportunity for Rock Band to pick up the remaining music.

1575
02:03:29,705 --> 02:03:31,006
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd freaking love to play Dreams.

1576
02:03:31,946 --> 02:03:33,609
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for reading, as always, Ossifer.

1577
02:03:34,089 --> 02:03:34,410
[SPEAKER_07]: P.S.

1578
02:03:34,490 --> 02:03:39,037
[SPEAKER_07]: I just want to note that it was very painful news on Thursday, June 25th, when Michael Jackson died.

1579
02:03:39,437 --> 02:03:42,182
[SPEAKER_07]: May he rest in peace, but forever live on through his music.

1580
02:03:42,803 --> 02:03:47,329
[SPEAKER_07]: And what a great tribute that would be if Harmonix gave us the Thriller album as Rock Band DLC.

1581
02:03:48,038 --> 02:03:48,919
[SPEAKER_16]: Don't count on it.

1582
02:03:49,339 --> 02:03:50,060
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

1583
02:03:50,460 --> 02:03:51,200
[SPEAKER_16]: Wishful thinking.

1584
02:03:51,341 --> 02:03:54,823
[SPEAKER_16]: I realize everybody's still wrapped up.

1585
02:03:54,863 --> 02:03:58,306
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't want to re-get into this topic, but everybody's still wrapped up in the Michael Jackson thing.

1586
02:03:59,127 --> 02:03:59,887
[SPEAKER_16]: Don't count on it.

1587
02:04:00,328 --> 02:04:03,630
[SPEAKER_16]: Something like that is going to be years and years in the making because guess what?

1588
02:04:04,431 --> 02:04:07,553
[SPEAKER_16]: The rights to that stuff now is all going to be up in the air.

1589
02:04:07,933 --> 02:04:13,798
[SPEAKER_16]: With the debt that man left behind, if rumors are to be believed, these type of struggles will go on for years.

1590
02:04:14,459 --> 02:04:16,160
[SPEAKER_07]: Did you see Misty sent us clips?

1591
02:04:17,674 --> 02:04:18,294
[SPEAKER_16]: No, I didn't.

1592
02:04:18,374 --> 02:04:19,955
[SPEAKER_07]: Misty sent us a bunch of clips.

1593
02:04:20,055 --> 02:04:21,856
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that you should hop into the mailbag too.

1594
02:04:23,796 --> 02:04:24,217
[SPEAKER_16]: I might.

1595
02:04:24,337 --> 02:04:25,257
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh my gosh, wow.

1596
02:04:25,737 --> 02:04:27,498
[SPEAKER_16]: I might have to play those during the afterbirth tonight.

1597
02:04:27,818 --> 02:04:28,118
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.

1598
02:04:28,498 --> 02:04:28,758
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

1599
02:04:29,539 --> 02:04:30,179
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Misty.

1600
02:04:34,808 --> 02:04:37,871
[SPEAKER_13]: I thought he's still rich, but his company's bankrupt.

1601
02:04:38,752 --> 02:04:41,676
[SPEAKER_16]: To be honest, I don't know, nor do I feel like it's any of my business.

1602
02:04:41,716 --> 02:04:42,597
[SPEAKER_16]: I kind of don't care.

1603
02:04:43,218 --> 02:04:46,682
[SPEAKER_16]: I sound rude, but it's not my finances.

1604
02:04:46,982 --> 02:04:48,464
[SPEAKER_16]: I got my own finances to worry about.

1605
02:04:48,564 --> 02:04:49,665
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, we've got two more emails.

1606
02:04:50,365 --> 02:04:50,986
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, now to business.

1607
02:04:51,006 --> 02:04:51,346
[SPEAKER_07]: Ooh, so serious.

1608
02:05:11,101 --> 02:05:11,522
[SPEAKER_07]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft

1609
02:05:29,079 --> 02:05:33,781
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, it caught me crazy and stuff, but now I'm glad Konami didn't bring Guitar Freaks and Drum Mania stateside.

1610
02:05:34,322 --> 02:05:41,886
[SPEAKER_07]: That way we got Guitar Hero and Rock Band, which are truly great and haven't lost their appeal to the public, no matter how much Activision is milking Guitar Hero, though.

1611
02:05:42,566 --> 02:05:46,588
[SPEAKER_13]: They did bring Guitar Freaks and Drum Mania to this side of the pond, I guess.

1612
02:05:46,668 --> 02:05:48,209
[SPEAKER_13]: In the arcades.

1613
02:05:48,769 --> 02:05:52,591
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, in the arcades, but also as Rock Revolution, unfortunately.

1614
02:05:53,352 --> 02:05:53,972
[SPEAKER_07]: That doesn't count.

1615
02:05:55,163 --> 02:06:06,827
[SPEAKER_07]: I still wondered what would have happened if Konami brought Guitadora, but considering how Rock Revolution did, I'm glad they didn't.

1616
02:06:07,307 --> 02:06:11,569
[SPEAKER_07]: Granted, it wouldn't have been the same game, but still, look at the way DDR and pop music are going.

1617
02:06:11,989 --> 02:06:18,251
[SPEAKER_07]: Not good at all, and Guitar Freaks Germania would have taken the same route and doomed the rhythm games for years to come.

1618
02:06:19,231 --> 02:06:22,234
[SPEAKER_07]: So, thank you Konami for not giving us Guitar Freaks and Drum Mania.

1619
02:06:22,615 --> 02:06:27,060
[SPEAKER_07]: Rock Revolution proved what it would have happened to Guitadora over the years.

1620
02:06:27,580 --> 02:06:32,906
[SPEAKER_07]: Now don't screw up and don't release another bad port of Beat Mania because of Scratch and DJ Hero.

1621
02:06:33,326 --> 02:06:37,070
[SPEAKER_07]: Heck, forget about Bimani and the States and let K-Set J do their thing.

1622
02:06:37,491 --> 02:06:40,354
[SPEAKER_07]: At least they know if the record breaks, don't try to fix it.

1623
02:06:42,791 --> 02:06:43,791
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for reading this email.

1624
02:06:43,811 --> 02:06:47,633
[SPEAKER_07]: And again, congrats on the seven years entertaining the internet every Sunday.

1625
02:06:48,093 --> 02:06:48,393
[SPEAKER_07]: P.S.

1626
02:06:48,453 --> 02:06:50,794
[SPEAKER_07]: If Jason Enos were dead, he'd be rolling in his grave right now.

1627
02:06:51,795 --> 02:06:52,495
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, he's not.

1628
02:06:52,575 --> 02:06:53,976
[SPEAKER_16]: He's alive and well.

1629
02:06:54,116 --> 02:06:55,357
[SPEAKER_07]: He's somewhere else.

1630
02:06:55,397 --> 02:06:55,937
[SPEAKER_16]: He's at EA now.

1631
02:06:56,437 --> 02:06:57,217
[SPEAKER_16]: I think I can say that.

1632
02:06:57,358 --> 02:06:58,658
[SPEAKER_07]: He's moved on to a better place.

1633
02:06:59,419 --> 02:07:08,323
[SPEAKER_16]: Look, I don't know if I agree very much with the whole rock revolution is what guitar freaks would have become.

1634
02:07:08,863 --> 02:07:09,744
[SPEAKER_16]: DarkSakura, Luke, Carameldansen

1635
02:07:34,597 --> 02:07:47,917
[SPEAKER_16]: and use the Bomani brand to do it knowing that they wouldn't be able to say anything about it because Konami did have Guitar Freaks they did have the Bomani thing and just that they just piss poor execution stop being lazy

1636
02:07:49,855 --> 02:08:12,249
[SPEAKER_16]: and hopefully they're learning their lesson when this game is an embarrassment Rock Revolution, there's really no nice way for me to say it with as much nice things as Konami has put out in the past and people that I even know there and so on there is no nice way for me to say it Rock Revolution was an embarrassment to that company and it should never happen again

1637
02:08:16,061 --> 02:08:16,601
[SPEAKER_16]: Any more emails?

1638
02:08:17,402 --> 02:08:18,062
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, yes, we did.

1639
02:08:19,123 --> 02:08:19,623
[SPEAKER_07]: Last one.

1640
02:08:20,263 --> 02:08:21,504
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, Rob, Jamie, and Matt.

1641
02:08:21,544 --> 02:08:23,685
[SPEAKER_07]: This is long-time listener SSJ100Matt.

1642
02:08:24,346 --> 02:08:28,928
[SPEAKER_07]: I first wanted to congratulate and praise you on your seventh anniversary.

1643
02:08:29,008 --> 02:08:34,231
[SPEAKER_07]: It's amazing that it was a little less than six years ago that I first started listening to the show.

1644
02:08:34,732 --> 02:08:40,035
[SPEAKER_07]: I first discovered OLR through a friend who recommended the now-long-defunct Wednesday show Outside the Box.

1645
02:08:40,535 --> 02:08:42,997
[SPEAKER_07]: From there, I discovered the Sunday show, and the rest was history.

1646
02:08:43,017 --> 02:08:43,777
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

1647
02:08:43,957 --> 02:08:47,741
[SPEAKER_07]: I know you guys get enough praise as it is and for the sake of this email I will keep it short.

1648
02:08:47,861 --> 02:08:48,642
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I like praise.

1649
02:08:48,682 --> 02:08:49,883
[SPEAKER_07]: Keep it up.

1650
02:08:50,163 --> 02:08:52,205
[SPEAKER_16]: I like that somebody remembers Outside the Box.

1651
02:08:52,286 --> 02:08:53,607
[SPEAKER_16]: I barely remember that show.

1652
02:08:54,208 --> 02:08:54,908
[SPEAKER_16]: That's crazy.

1653
02:08:54,928 --> 02:08:57,391
[SPEAKER_16]: That was a side show I hosted years ago with some friends.

1654
02:08:58,227 --> 02:09:04,210
[SPEAKER_07]: You three have sacrificed seven years of your Sunday nights for the sake of us, the listener, and have never asked for anything in return.

1655
02:09:04,691 --> 02:09:14,716
[SPEAKER_07]: We, the listeners, can never make that amount of dedication up to you, except continue to listen, tell to people, support, and write for the website, like my Blades of Steel article, Cheap Plug, Cheap Plug.

1656
02:09:15,977 --> 02:09:17,618
[SPEAKER_16]: Which was a very lovely article, actually.

1657
02:09:18,158 --> 02:09:18,658
[SPEAKER_16]: Check that out.

1658
02:09:18,698 --> 02:09:20,139
[SPEAKER_16]: It's on the website, orangelandradio.com.

1659
02:09:21,491 --> 02:09:24,452
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you so much for informing and making us laugh for seven great years.

1660
02:09:25,192 --> 02:09:29,873
[SPEAKER_07]: Now that I have all that praise out of the way, I wanted to ask your guys' opinion on something.

1661
02:09:30,694 --> 02:09:36,175
[SPEAKER_07]: Over the course of this next two weeks, I will be having a few get-togethers with about 25 of my friends.

1662
02:09:36,655 --> 02:09:39,816
[SPEAKER_07]: We, of course, intend on having video games be the centerpiece of these parties.

1663
02:09:40,336 --> 02:09:43,457
[SPEAKER_07]: I was wondering if you had any ideas or recommendations for great party games.

1664
02:09:43,837 --> 02:09:45,038
[SPEAKER_07]: that we may want to try playing.

1665
02:09:45,178 --> 02:09:52,763
[SPEAKER_07]: As it stands now, we have Gears of War 2, Team Fortress 2, various Wii Party games, Street Fighter 4, Left 4 Dead, and of course Rock Band 2 and Guitar Hero World Tour.

1666
02:09:53,383 --> 02:09:57,986
[SPEAKER_07]: Your input would be most helpful, and once again, thank you, thank you, thank you for seven years of great radio.

1667
02:09:58,266 --> 02:09:59,827
[SPEAKER_07]: Your super Hebrew pally, SSJ100Matt.

1668
02:10:03,478 --> 02:10:04,999
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, you mentioned the Wii Party games.

1669
02:10:05,039 --> 02:10:07,779
[SPEAKER_07]: I was actually going to say there's the Mario Party games are pretty fun.

1670
02:10:09,680 --> 02:10:11,641
[SPEAKER_07]: I think you've named about what I would have named.

1671
02:10:11,781 --> 02:10:13,401
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, Marvel Ultimate Alliance.

1672
02:10:13,901 --> 02:10:15,622
[SPEAKER_16]: Get your four player on.

1673
02:10:15,782 --> 02:10:17,622
[SPEAKER_16]: Instant Party just add Rock Band.

1674
02:10:17,662 --> 02:10:18,422
[SPEAKER_16]: It's so true.

1675
02:10:18,782 --> 02:10:20,283
[SPEAKER_07]: Seeing it is actually pretty fun.

1676
02:10:20,723 --> 02:10:26,465
[SPEAKER_16]: But, you know, if you kids are kind of worn out on that stuff, go back to the old school stuff.

1677
02:10:26,545 --> 02:10:28,526
[SPEAKER_16]: Seriously, whip out Super Mario Bros.

1678
02:10:29,047 --> 02:10:28,526
3.

1679
02:10:29,787 --> 02:10:32,168
[SPEAKER_16]: You can get a party around the old school games, too.

1680
02:10:32,208 --> 02:10:32,468
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, no.

1681
02:10:32,768 --> 02:10:34,449
[SPEAKER_07]: Hook up a Dreamcast, Power Stone 2.

1682
02:10:36,030 --> 02:10:37,671
[SPEAKER_16]: It depends on the type of audience.

1683
02:10:37,691 --> 02:10:38,951
[SPEAKER_16]: Did he say it was other gamers?

1684
02:10:39,031 --> 02:10:41,593
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, he said the games were to be the centerpiece.

1685
02:10:41,693 --> 02:10:48,276
[SPEAKER_16]: Is it other gamers or is it just random kids our age?

1686
02:10:48,696 --> 02:10:49,596
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what?

1687
02:10:49,756 --> 02:10:53,458
[SPEAKER_07]: This is what I like to do sometimes because we've had parties like that before.

1688
02:10:54,098 --> 02:11:02,682
[SPEAKER_07]: If you want to see certain stuff go on, say, hey, bring the system and bring your favorite group game and we'll switch out through them.

1689
02:11:03,823 --> 02:11:04,763
[SPEAKER_07]: What's the problem with that?

1690
02:11:06,862 --> 02:11:15,656
[SPEAKER_16]: I guess that's true yeah it's like a like a potluck a potluck for video games that's actually a really good idea a potluck of video games bring your favorite game I like that

1691
02:11:16,613 --> 02:11:17,754
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's the last one.

1692
02:11:17,974 --> 02:11:22,739
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, SSJ100Matt, for your kind words.

1693
02:11:23,039 --> 02:11:25,741
[SPEAKER_16]: Hey, I opened up that file that Amisti sent us.

1694
02:11:25,801 --> 02:11:29,665
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh my gosh, I don't even know where to begin with these clips.

1695
02:11:29,705 --> 02:11:32,527
[SPEAKER_16]: There's like a million freaking clips in this thing.

1696
02:11:32,968 --> 02:11:38,533
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm just going to pick just a couple of these random files and play them just because I'm curious and we're in kind of a fucking mood tonight.

1697
02:11:39,233 --> 02:11:41,315
[SPEAKER_16]: Let's see, this file is called Into Lesbians.

1698
02:11:41,355 --> 02:11:42,036
[SPEAKER_16]: Let's see what this one is.

1699
02:11:42,356 --> 02:11:44,998
[SPEAKER_13]: If, like, if Twin was a girl, then his girlfriend would want to date him.

1700
02:11:45,158 --> 02:11:45,719
[SPEAKER_13]: Anyway!

1701
02:11:45,879 --> 02:11:46,659
[SPEAKER_13]: She's a lesbian, right?

1702
02:11:46,699 --> 02:11:47,320
[SPEAKER_13]: Anyway!

1703
02:11:48,841 --> 02:11:49,802
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't even know where these are from.

1704
02:11:50,142 --> 02:11:51,423
[SPEAKER_16]: Let's try one of these longer files.

1705
02:11:51,443 --> 02:11:54,085
[SPEAKER_16]: Let's see, this one says, OMG, gonna break your own ban.

1706
02:11:54,605 --> 02:11:55,886
[SPEAKER_16]: La la la, going to the mailbag.

1707
02:11:55,926 --> 02:11:57,307
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, I need mailbag music.

1708
02:11:57,907 --> 02:11:58,688
[SPEAKER_16]: Let's open up the mailbag.

1709
02:11:58,728 --> 02:11:59,068
[SPEAKER_07]: Email.

1710
02:11:59,308 --> 02:11:59,949
[SPEAKER_16]: There might be more.

1711
02:11:59,969 --> 02:12:02,171
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll have to play one Jenny Rom song just because it fits.

1712
02:12:03,291 --> 02:12:05,213
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, we're gonna play, oh, we're gonna play, uh... Email Me.

1713
02:12:05,533 --> 02:12:07,414
[SPEAKER_16]: Email Me is not Jenny Rom, that's, uh, Paul Terry.

1714
02:12:07,434 --> 02:12:08,075
[SPEAKER_11]: Why is it not Jenny Rom?

1715
02:12:08,115 --> 02:12:08,535
[SPEAKER_11]: I meant Paul Terry.

1716
02:12:08,555 --> 02:12:09,156
[SPEAKER_16]: You meant Blonde Girl.

1717
02:12:10,492 --> 02:12:11,393
[SPEAKER_16]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1718
02:12:32,256 --> 02:12:32,596
[SPEAKER_16]: Lord.

1719
02:12:32,676 --> 02:12:33,597
[SPEAKER_16]: I want to see what this is.

1720
02:12:33,997 --> 02:12:35,578
[SPEAKER_16]: God, Surge tastes like shit.

1721
02:12:35,658 --> 02:12:37,119
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, important message.

1722
02:12:37,479 --> 02:12:43,383
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, if you don't like Surge, you can drink that Pepsi Blue shit.

1723
02:12:43,563 --> 02:12:45,464
[SPEAKER_16]: Remember how god-awful Surge was?

1724
02:12:45,584 --> 02:12:46,405
[SPEAKER_16]: It was awesome!

1725
02:12:46,485 --> 02:12:47,546
[SPEAKER_08]: I love Surge!

1726
02:12:47,566 --> 02:12:48,446
[SPEAKER_16]: What the hell?

1727
02:12:48,706 --> 02:12:49,407
[SPEAKER_16]: It was terrible.

1728
02:12:49,587 --> 02:12:50,687
[SPEAKER_13]: Pepsi Blue?

1729
02:12:51,068 --> 02:12:51,768
[SPEAKER_13]: It was all about Storm.

1730
02:12:51,788 --> 02:12:51,888
[SPEAKER_13]: What?! !

1731
02:12:58,266 --> 02:12:59,006
[SPEAKER_13]: I've tried Storm.

1732
02:12:59,026 --> 02:12:59,867
[SPEAKER_13]: I didn't like Storm.

1733
02:12:59,907 --> 02:13:00,787
[SPEAKER_13]: Surge was awesome, though.

1734
02:13:00,827 --> 02:13:03,328
[SPEAKER_13]: We had a vending machine at QZAR.

1735
02:13:03,748 --> 02:13:06,249
[SPEAKER_13]: All that was in it was Surge, and I loved that stuff.

1736
02:13:06,509 --> 02:13:06,929
[SPEAKER_16]: Whatever.

1737
02:13:10,010 --> 02:13:11,711
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm very sad that it's gone now.

1738
02:13:11,991 --> 02:13:14,152
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm looking at some of these other long clips here.

1739
02:13:14,712 --> 02:13:16,432
[SPEAKER_16]: Rob with candy full.

1740
02:13:16,492 --> 02:13:17,273
[SPEAKER_16]: What the hell is this?

1741
02:13:17,673 --> 02:13:20,014
[SPEAKER_07]: Speaking of turdy things, though, guess what happened?

1742
02:13:20,694 --> 02:13:22,855
[SPEAKER_07]: Itagaki got sued for sexual harassment.

1743
02:13:23,235 --> 02:13:26,976
[SPEAKER_07]: A 31-year-old employee of Tecmo... Shouldn't that have been Speaking of Candy?

1744
02:13:28,195 --> 02:13:31,117
[SPEAKER_07]: The compensation she is looking for... Rob...

1745
02:13:57,245 --> 02:14:01,588
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, she's seeking compensation in 10 million... Rob, what the hell?

1746
02:14:03,289 --> 02:14:04,170
[SPEAKER_15]: It's candy, get it?

1747
02:14:05,131 --> 02:14:06,752
[SPEAKER_07]: This candy is not so delicious.

1748
02:14:08,913 --> 02:14:09,994
[SPEAKER_16]: Wow.

1749
02:14:10,074 --> 02:14:11,115
[SPEAKER_16]: Let's see, one more here.

1750
02:14:11,235 --> 02:14:12,736
[SPEAKER_16]: Offensive things you've missed.

1751
02:14:12,776 --> 02:14:13,697
[SPEAKER_16]: I like the word offensive.

1752
02:14:14,537 --> 02:14:16,178
[SPEAKER_16]: She's literally sent like a ton of clips.

1753
02:14:17,519 --> 02:14:20,642
[SPEAKER_16]: We could just sit here and play these all night long and we'd have like a whole show full of stuff.

1754
02:14:20,962 --> 02:14:22,483
[SPEAKER_16]: Let me do this and we'll do some more video game stories.

1755
02:14:22,503 --> 02:14:23,964
[SPEAKER_16]: Let's see, offensive things you've missed.

1756
02:14:24,224 --> 02:14:28,366
[SPEAKER_16]: Some of you guys may be thinking, well, didn't you guys used to do the rewinds on your own damn station, Sky?

1757
02:14:29,026 --> 02:14:35,390
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, actually, that's true, but now it is the oldie and moldie Wednesday flashback, where we are 100 episodes behind right now.

1758
02:14:35,430 --> 02:14:37,190
[SPEAKER_16]: So you can hear what the show sounded like two years ago.

1759
02:14:37,751 --> 02:14:38,411
[SPEAKER_16]: It's pretty nuts.

1760
02:14:39,732 --> 02:14:48,396
[SPEAKER_15]: I kind of looked at the chat and some of the response to last week's episode, and I think Misty or somebody had said, it's a good thing I wasn't there, because I would have ripped them a new asshole.

1761
02:14:50,148 --> 02:14:55,990
[SPEAKER_15]: So hear what offensive things you missed out on back on episodes 20 and 21 and all that stuff we're playing way back when.

1762
02:14:56,010 --> 02:14:56,970
[SPEAKER_15]: So check it out.

1763
02:14:57,110 --> 02:14:58,811
[SPEAKER_16]: I think that was on our old station.

1764
02:14:58,851 --> 02:15:01,251
[SPEAKER_16]: We used to play shows that were like three years old.

1765
02:15:02,052 --> 02:15:02,792
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't even know.

1766
02:15:02,992 --> 02:15:07,533
[SPEAKER_16]: We lost a ton of shows when one of our hard drives went out, which is a bummer.

1767
02:15:07,973 --> 02:15:09,094
[SPEAKER_16]: They might still be around.

1768
02:15:09,114 --> 02:15:10,554
[SPEAKER_16]: Do you know who added me on Twitter the other day?

1769
02:15:10,574 --> 02:15:11,394
[SPEAKER_16]: It was DDR Angel.

1770
02:15:11,414 --> 02:15:15,996
[SPEAKER_16]: And if anybody has old OLR episodes, between her and Misty, we could probably find them all.

1771
02:15:17,011 --> 02:15:18,052
[SPEAKER_16]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1772
02:15:37,850 --> 02:15:43,854
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, apparently there is a brand new game entering the wrestling game genre.

1773
02:15:44,514 --> 02:15:50,959
[SPEAKER_13]: And this is being put out by Immersion Software on the Wii, PSP, and DS.

1774
02:15:51,519 --> 02:15:56,682
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, I'm sorry, that's by a different Argentine developer, Sabasa Studios.

1775
02:15:57,303 --> 02:15:59,804
[SPEAKER_13]: But anyways, Immersion Software, they're putting it out on the 360 and PS3.

1776
02:16:00,045 --> 02:16:01,906
[SPEAKER_13]: It is a Lucha Libre game.

1777
02:16:01,926 --> 02:16:02,086
[SPEAKER_13]: Woohoo!

1778
02:16:02,546 --> 02:16:04,027
[SPEAKER_13]: Lucha Libre Stars Psycho Clown

1779
02:16:29,719 --> 02:16:31,560
[SPEAKER_13]: Who doesn't like a psycho clown?

1780
02:16:31,700 --> 02:16:34,322
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, and they have a teaser trailer up, which I haven't seen yet.

1781
02:16:34,502 --> 02:16:37,283
[SPEAKER_13]: That looks awesome.

1782
02:16:40,025 --> 02:16:44,787
[SPEAKER_13]: As long as they have... What was it?

1783
02:16:46,028 --> 02:16:46,508
[SPEAKER_13]: Santos.

1784
02:16:47,569 --> 02:16:48,289
[SPEAKER_13]: He's gotta be in there.

1785
02:16:50,751 --> 02:16:53,612
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't follow this crap, so that's why I'm quiet right now.

1786
02:16:54,273 --> 02:16:55,733
[SPEAKER_16]: This makes no sense to me, but okay.

1787
02:16:55,993 --> 02:16:56,734
[SPEAKER_16]: You boys have your fun.

1788
02:16:58,755 --> 02:16:59,876
[SPEAKER_16]: It's Mexican wrestlers.

1789
02:16:59,916 --> 02:17:00,697
[SPEAKER_16]: It'll be awesome.

1790
02:17:03,639 --> 02:17:04,399
[SPEAKER_13]: Hey, I'm not doubting you.

1791
02:17:04,419 --> 02:17:04,900
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm just saying.

1792
02:17:04,940 --> 02:17:06,601
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm not a fan.

1793
02:17:07,362 --> 02:17:09,863
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, I'm not a fan of it either, but it's Mexican wrestlers.

1794
02:17:09,903 --> 02:17:16,608
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, hell, they have, what is it, the Santos line of videos.

1795
02:17:16,688 --> 02:17:20,191
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a Mexican wrestler who's solving mysteries and stuff like that.

1796
02:17:20,211 --> 02:17:22,152
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, that's just cheesy and weird.

1797
02:17:23,373 --> 02:17:23,774
[SPEAKER_16]: You know what?

1798
02:17:23,894 --> 02:17:26,055
[SPEAKER_16]: You want to know a Mexican wrestler that was badass?

1799
02:17:26,075 --> 02:17:28,037
[SPEAKER_16]: Did you ever play Saturday Night Slam Masters?

1800
02:17:28,764 --> 02:17:30,386
[SPEAKER_16]: El Stingray El Stingray

1801
02:17:51,829 --> 02:17:52,149
[SPEAKER_16]: Skybit Skybit

1802
02:18:07,952 --> 02:18:10,194
[SPEAKER_16]: Are there any of the big stories we haven't got to yet, Loki?

1803
02:18:38,015 --> 02:18:39,797
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, might not be exactly June 30th.

1804
02:18:40,517 --> 02:18:42,719
[SPEAKER_13]: But that's kind of cool.

1805
02:18:42,859 --> 02:18:43,400
[SPEAKER_16]: It was very cool.

1806
02:18:45,001 --> 02:18:48,284
[SPEAKER_16]: Let me cover a couple quick stories here real quick before we go to the Skype line.

1807
02:18:49,345 --> 02:18:49,666
[SPEAKER_16]: Let's see.

1808
02:18:49,826 --> 02:18:54,430
[SPEAKER_16]: Archon is coming to the iPhone, which makes me very happy because I remember this game from the Commodore 64.

1809
02:18:54,490 --> 02:18:58,614
[SPEAKER_16]: I think it actually did just come out because my friend was showing me that he bought it the other day.

1810
02:18:59,434 --> 02:19:03,078
[SPEAKER_16]: It is out for $4 for the iPhone and the iPod Touch.

1811
02:19:03,618 --> 02:19:04,639
[SPEAKER_16]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1812
02:19:25,757 --> 02:19:27,460
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, I've got a few more stories here real quick.

1813
02:19:27,500 --> 02:19:27,700
[SPEAKER_13]: Sure.

1814
02:19:28,722 --> 02:19:33,008
[SPEAKER_13]: There's a rumor that 1v100 is coming out of beta next week and will actually be giving prizes.

1815
02:19:33,609 --> 02:19:35,171
[SPEAKER_13]: So that would be cool.

1816
02:19:36,653 --> 02:19:37,655
[SPEAKER_16]: I bet that's not true.

1817
02:19:38,979 --> 02:19:40,140
[SPEAKER_16]: Bit.Trip Core 100th WiiWare Game 100th WiiWare Game

1818
02:19:56,769 --> 02:19:58,571
[SPEAKER_13]: Namco Networks BurgerTime Deluxe

1819
02:20:16,348 --> 02:20:17,628
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes, I heard about this.

1820
02:20:18,009 --> 02:20:29,832
[SPEAKER_16]: I've heard a lot of people call it crap, but BurgerTime was an awesome game in the 80s, but even I can admit it's probably one of those things that's better left in the 80s, but I will check this out.

1821
02:20:30,272 --> 02:20:35,654
[SPEAKER_16]: It just looks like the old game was souped up graphics and new stages, which it's not like the stages are that complicated.

1822
02:20:35,934 --> 02:20:39,736
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, it's probably... And then finally, last thing... Oh, actually, I got two things.

1823
02:20:40,377 --> 02:20:43,338
[SPEAKER_13]: Bethesda, their parent company bought id Software.

1824
02:20:43,879 --> 02:20:48,822
[SPEAKER_13]: So now that's kind of under the whole... Zenimax, I guess, was the company that owns Bethesda.

1825
02:20:48,902 --> 02:20:50,823
[SPEAKER_13]: Now they own id Software as well.

1826
02:20:51,343 --> 02:21:01,229
[SPEAKER_13]: And apparently the next two games, Rage and Wolfenstein, obviously, are going to be published under their respective publishers, EA and Activision.

1827
02:21:02,050 --> 02:21:02,130
[SPEAKER_13]: Um...

1828
02:21:03,154 --> 02:21:07,456
[SPEAKER_13]: But now all the further games are being published under probably like Bethesda or something like that.

1829
02:21:07,476 --> 02:21:07,956
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know.

1830
02:21:08,517 --> 02:21:12,138
[SPEAKER_13]: Zenimax, unless Zenimax has come out as a new publisher, I guess.

1831
02:21:13,879 --> 02:21:24,324
[SPEAKER_13]: Apparently if you were a subscriber to EGM, and since EGM is kind of gone right now, your subscriptions were converted into Maxim subscriptions, which I think is a fair trade if you ask me.

1832
02:21:26,305 --> 02:21:27,146
[SPEAKER_13]: So that's kind of neat.

1833
02:21:28,226 --> 02:21:34,911
[SPEAKER_13]: and then still yet another survey suggesting that Netflix streaming is coming to the Wii.

1834
02:21:34,931 --> 02:21:37,313
[SPEAKER_16]: We get this damn survey like every six months.

1835
02:21:37,473 --> 02:21:41,776
[SPEAKER_13]: The only difference now is instead of a one-time fee of $9.99, it will be free.

1836
02:21:42,336 --> 02:21:45,259
[SPEAKER_13]: So you will not have to purchase a streaming disc, but eh.

1837
02:21:45,879 --> 02:21:46,800
[SPEAKER_13]: If it happens, it happens.

1838
02:21:46,920 --> 02:21:47,180
[SPEAKER_13]: Cool.

1839
02:21:47,920 --> 02:21:49,001
[SPEAKER_13]: And then finally, Ubisoft.

1840
02:21:49,021 --> 02:21:52,804
[SPEAKER_16]: That would make the Wii a little more lucrative than 360 because you wouldn't have to have gold.

1841
02:21:53,444 --> 02:21:53,864
[SPEAKER_16]: Very true.

1842
02:21:54,045 --> 02:21:56,986
[SPEAKER_16]: That's a big feather in Wii's cap.

1843
02:21:57,407 --> 02:21:58,608
[SPEAKER_16]: Don't underestimate that.

1844
02:21:59,388 --> 02:22:00,689
[SPEAKER_16]: Don't underestimate that.

1845
02:22:00,709 --> 02:22:02,050
[SPEAKER_16]: You can't do HD streaming, though.

1846
02:22:03,851 --> 02:22:04,371
[SPEAKER_16]: You know what?

1847
02:22:04,471 --> 02:22:09,355
[SPEAKER_16]: Considering the type of stuff that's there, I'm just going to say don't underestimate that.

1848
02:22:10,552 --> 02:22:13,274
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm very critical of the Wii on this show, but that could be big.

1849
02:22:13,874 --> 02:22:16,216
[SPEAKER_16]: Free Netflix, essentially, if you already have a Netflix account.

1850
02:22:16,236 --> 02:22:20,679
[SPEAKER_13]: Rob, how long does it take for the internet browser to load up in the Wii?

1851
02:22:20,939 --> 02:22:26,523
[SPEAKER_16]: You know what, if they can figure out the connectivity that makes games like Super Smash Bros.

1852
02:22:26,563 --> 02:22:33,708
[SPEAKER_16]: and stuff work for kids programming and non-HD type stuff, again, don't underestimate it, Matt.

1853
02:22:34,408 --> 02:22:40,352
[SPEAKER_13]: And then finally, Ubisoft's collaboration with Q Entertainment, it's likely to be a music game.

1854
02:22:41,355 --> 02:22:44,023
[SPEAKER_16]: But, I mean, really, when you look at it... Ah, it's Q Entertainment.

1855
02:22:44,043 --> 02:22:44,945
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, exactly.

1856
02:22:45,387 --> 02:22:47,934
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, unless it's 99 Nights 2, which I somehow doubt.

1857
02:22:49,514 --> 02:23:15,846
[SPEAKER_16]: Alright, look, our skyline's already ringing off the hook And I really want to get to that very soon But one other quick story for you guys, if I could Marvel vs. Capcom 2 Big rumors out there that the game was coming out June 29th Not true, per the Twitters Official Capcom Twitter is not coming out June 29th They don't know where the rumor came from Well, let me tell you, it was from Marvel's financial report So you might want to look at that But they're saying now it's closer to the end of July That the game will actually come out So sorry if you guys were looking forward to that one

1858
02:23:16,586 --> 02:23:17,707
[SPEAKER_16]: But it's not coming out this month.

1859
02:23:17,727 --> 02:23:21,389
[SPEAKER_13]: That makes sense, though, because I think, wasn't it part of the Summer of Arcade or something like that?

1860
02:23:21,449 --> 02:23:23,470
[SPEAKER_13]: And that doesn't start until, like, the end of July anyways.

1861
02:23:24,250 --> 02:23:24,850
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, I don't know.

1862
02:23:25,231 --> 02:23:26,731
[SPEAKER_16]: Alright, look, our phone is ringing off the hook.

1863
02:23:26,751 --> 02:23:28,852
[SPEAKER_16]: Let's get some calls done tonight.

1864
02:23:28,912 --> 02:23:29,813
[SPEAKER_16]: Hi, you're on Orange Dance Radio.

1865
02:23:29,833 --> 02:23:30,153
[SPEAKER_16]: Who's this?

1866
02:23:31,294 --> 02:23:34,355
[SPEAKER_12]: Saying that, it calls in almost every single week from the East Coast.

1867
02:23:34,375 --> 02:23:36,416
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know how you get through every time, but I'll tell you what.

1868
02:23:36,857 --> 02:23:40,218
[SPEAKER_16]: I've seen, like, seven different names pop up in the corners, so you're lucky tonight.

1869
02:23:40,238 --> 02:23:40,739
[SPEAKER_16]: What's on your mind?

1870
02:23:41,659 --> 02:23:42,179
[SPEAKER_12]: Not much.

1871
02:23:42,339 --> 02:23:43,320
[SPEAKER_12]: First off, I want to say...

1872
02:23:44,093 --> 02:23:45,353
[SPEAKER_12]: Happy anniversary to you guys.

1873
02:23:45,433 --> 02:23:46,193
[SPEAKER_12]: Happy birthday.

1874
02:23:46,233 --> 02:23:47,094
[SPEAKER_16]: Congratulations.

1875
02:23:47,254 --> 02:23:47,654
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

1876
02:23:47,794 --> 02:23:51,294
[SPEAKER_16]: We're seven, so we should be having this anniversary show at Chuck E. Cheese.

1877
02:23:52,314 --> 02:23:53,635
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, but you're still immature.

1878
02:23:54,895 --> 02:23:55,935
[SPEAKER_16]: As a seven-year-old should be.

1879
02:23:57,215 --> 02:23:58,115
[SPEAKER_16]: What's on your mind tonight, buddy?

1880
02:23:58,916 --> 02:24:01,296
[SPEAKER_12]: I have a question about E3.

1881
02:24:03,196 --> 02:24:08,757
[SPEAKER_12]: Before you guys went, you had made a statement about how you felt E3 wasn't going to be the same.

1882
02:24:08,797 --> 02:24:12,918
[SPEAKER_12]: You had different feelings and intake about it before you went.

1883
02:24:14,482 --> 02:24:16,584
[SPEAKER_12]: Did you feel the same way when you went or what?

1884
02:24:17,024 --> 02:24:25,371
[SPEAKER_16]: Are you talking about the show itself or what I was kind of lamenting about that nobody I knew was really going so it was going to be a little weird this year?

1885
02:24:26,280 --> 02:24:28,042
[SPEAKER_12]: A little bit of column A and a little bit of column B

1886
02:24:45,638 --> 02:24:54,344
[SPEAKER_16]: But I think whatever they did to kind of filter out some of the people that didn't really need to be there, and one might argue maybe I don't need to be there, but I would argue right back, mofo.

1887
02:24:55,084 --> 02:25:01,689
[SPEAKER_16]: But I would say whatever they did to kind of scale back attendance by whatever they did from 2006 was a good thing.

1888
02:25:01,729 --> 02:25:03,890
[SPEAKER_16]: I think the show itself was good.

1889
02:25:04,351 --> 02:25:09,234
[SPEAKER_16]: I do want to see them reopen Kensha Hall at some point, get some more exhibitors out there on the main floor.

1890
02:25:10,455 --> 02:25:15,058
[SPEAKER_16]: And again, all that stuff that's behind closed doors kind of bugs me sometimes.

1891
02:25:15,558 --> 02:25:17,400
[SPEAKER_16]: But whatever, it's just something we're going to have to deal with.

1892
02:25:17,440 --> 02:25:18,942
[SPEAKER_16]: I think overall the show itself was better.

1893
02:25:20,724 --> 02:25:26,190
[SPEAKER_16]: As far as the whole me lamenting about my friends not going and all that stuff, I think a lot of that got better.

1894
02:25:26,230 --> 02:25:29,574
[SPEAKER_16]: I got to go to a pretty bitchin' party on Wednesday night that was hosted by...

1895
02:25:30,455 --> 02:25:31,656
[SPEAKER_16]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1896
02:25:58,536 --> 02:25:58,896
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know.

1897
02:25:59,076 --> 02:26:01,878
[SPEAKER_16]: It was kind of cool that one day Loki was there and we got to go around.

1898
02:26:03,780 --> 02:26:09,484
[SPEAKER_16]: At night, at least, I had my boyfriend there that I kind of got to see at night, so it didn't end up being so bad in that regard.

1899
02:26:09,884 --> 02:26:14,807
[SPEAKER_16]: I think I would have had even more fun and I would be more excited and woo, and I would have gone all three days.

1900
02:26:15,128 --> 02:26:16,729
[SPEAKER_16]: Keep that in mind because that's a big thing too.

1901
02:26:16,749 --> 02:26:17,910
[SPEAKER_16]: I didn't go all three days this year.

1902
02:26:18,650 --> 02:26:19,090
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, okay.

1903
02:26:40,037 --> 02:26:43,258
[SPEAKER_16]: If you want to go to E3, but you can't, just go to PAX.

1904
02:26:43,859 --> 02:26:46,760
[SPEAKER_16]: And Bobby's made this comparison before, and I think he's absolutely right.

1905
02:26:47,081 --> 02:26:50,042
[SPEAKER_16]: PAX is probably what you think E3 is.

1906
02:26:51,143 --> 02:26:51,763
[SPEAKER_16]: So go to PAX.

1907
02:26:54,005 --> 02:26:54,965
[SPEAKER_16]: I'll be there at PAX.

1908
02:26:55,145 --> 02:26:56,326
[SPEAKER_16]: East Coast PAX, that is.

1909
02:26:56,426 --> 02:26:57,687
[SPEAKER_16]: I want to be at East Coast PAX.

1910
02:26:57,727 --> 02:26:59,988
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm trying, but I've got to make West Coast PAX work, too.

1911
02:27:00,849 --> 02:27:03,250
[SPEAKER_12]: Skip West Coast PAX and come to East Coast PAX.

1912
02:27:03,470 --> 02:27:05,871
[SPEAKER_12]: If I can have Ken and Ice Cream, I'm doing both, all right?

1913
02:27:09,039 --> 02:27:09,380
[SPEAKER_13]: DarkSakura.com

1914
02:27:22,435 --> 02:27:23,256
[SPEAKER_12]: Take a train.

1915
02:27:23,336 --> 02:27:23,676
[SPEAKER_12]: Take a train.

1916
02:27:46,843 --> 02:27:47,203
[SPEAKER_13]: or Train.

1917
02:27:47,243 --> 02:27:47,583
[SPEAKER_13]: There you go.

1918
02:27:47,943 --> 02:27:50,404
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not really all that far to Boston.

1919
02:27:50,464 --> 02:27:52,245
[SPEAKER_16]: Besides, I want to fly JetBlue to New York City.

1920
02:27:52,285 --> 02:27:52,765
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm sorry.

1921
02:27:52,805 --> 02:27:55,306
[SPEAKER_16]: If we can give them the option between Southwest or JetBlue.

1922
02:27:55,826 --> 02:27:56,206
[SPEAKER_16]: JetBlue.

1923
02:27:57,166 --> 02:27:59,787
[SPEAKER_16]: And I've heard lots of amazing things about Virgin Air.

1924
02:27:59,827 --> 02:28:01,548
[SPEAKER_16]: That's the airline I want to try at some point.

1925
02:28:02,008 --> 02:28:03,588
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, a lot of my friends fly Virgin Air.

1926
02:28:03,608 --> 02:28:04,409
[SPEAKER_12]: They just love it.

1927
02:28:04,689 --> 02:28:05,849
[SPEAKER_16]: I've heard great things about it.

1928
02:28:05,869 --> 02:28:06,969
[SPEAKER_16]: They had a huge float today too.

1929
02:28:07,290 --> 02:28:09,830
[SPEAKER_16]: Alright, hey Ranma, we've got to wrap up and let you go, but any quick final thoughts?

1930
02:28:11,951 --> 02:28:12,411
[SPEAKER_12]: That's it.

1931
02:28:12,511 --> 02:28:13,211
[SPEAKER_12]: That's pretty much it.

1932
02:28:13,552 --> 02:28:13,852
[SPEAKER_16]: Later.

1933
02:28:14,552 --> 02:28:14,752
[SPEAKER_16]: Later.

1934
02:28:16,664 --> 02:28:19,547
[SPEAKER_16]: SSJ100 Matt says, flying to New York and I'll drive you to Boston.

1935
02:28:19,887 --> 02:28:20,828
[SPEAKER_16]: That's a very nice offer.

1936
02:28:20,848 --> 02:28:23,071
[SPEAKER_16]: That might be a good way to see some of the East Coast too.

1937
02:28:23,131 --> 02:28:23,431
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know.

1938
02:28:23,731 --> 02:28:24,872
[SPEAKER_16]: It's so far off, you guys.

1939
02:28:24,932 --> 02:28:25,533
[SPEAKER_16]: I'll figure it out.

1940
02:28:25,573 --> 02:28:25,893
[SPEAKER_16]: Don't worry.

1941
02:28:25,953 --> 02:28:26,874
[SPEAKER_16]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1942
02:28:26,914 --> 02:28:27,235
[SPEAKER_16]: Who's this?

1943
02:28:27,255 --> 02:28:31,779
[SPEAKER_16]: Hola, bienvenidos a Orange Lounge Radio.

1944
02:28:31,839 --> 02:28:32,160
[SPEAKER_16]: Quien es?

1945
02:28:34,568 --> 02:28:37,770
[SPEAKER_16]: Again, always call Echo 123 before you give us a call.

1946
02:28:38,471 --> 02:28:43,574
[SPEAKER_16]: It's a good way to test your microphone, make sure everything is working just fine before you give us a ring.

1947
02:28:44,095 --> 02:28:46,416
[SPEAKER_16]: We're going to open up the Skype line, take some more calls.

1948
02:28:46,456 --> 02:28:47,437
[SPEAKER_16]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

1949
02:28:47,457 --> 02:28:47,817
[SPEAKER_16]: Who's this?

1950
02:28:49,058 --> 02:28:50,719
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi, this is Gold Answell.

1951
02:28:50,759 --> 02:28:53,341
[SPEAKER_10]: First of all, I want to wish you guys a happy 7th anniversary.

1952
02:28:53,381 --> 02:28:54,562
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, thank you very much.

1953
02:28:54,642 --> 02:28:56,083
[SPEAKER_16]: We're potty trained and everything now.

1954
02:28:58,169 --> 02:29:04,413
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I just, I wanted to agree on the past thing that Ranma said.

1955
02:29:04,854 --> 02:29:19,444
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I mean, I want you to come to PAX East because me and Robocoon, my friend that joined us for OR tonight, he's my friend and frequent podcast listener, he was saying, you know, I want to meet Rob Roberts because that would be the coolest thing ever because I've been...

1956
02:29:19,895 --> 02:29:22,319
[SPEAKER_10]: Me and him have actually been listening to your show for a couple years.

1957
02:29:22,699 --> 02:29:27,706
[SPEAKER_10]: You probably know that about me and not him, but I think I was the one that told them.

1958
02:29:28,067 --> 02:29:30,751
[SPEAKER_10]: And we're just like, wow, wouldn't it just be cool to meet Rob Ross?

1959
02:29:30,791 --> 02:29:34,697
[SPEAKER_10]: Even though they're not, like, big, but on the internet, it's just stuff that would be so cool.

1960
02:29:35,083 --> 02:29:36,724
[SPEAKER_16]: I understand life skates and the life of parents.

1961
02:29:59,474 --> 02:30:04,200
[SPEAKER_16]: Wish, wish, hope, hope that maybe some of my podcast buddies will be going out there too, so we can do something.

1962
02:30:04,401 --> 02:30:04,981
[SPEAKER_10]: I might be.

1963
02:30:05,042 --> 02:30:14,054
[SPEAKER_10]: If I can get a part-time job, I'm about 17 now, if I can find myself a part-time job, get myself a ticket, I will make every effort to be there, especially if you're there, but...

1964
02:30:14,654 --> 02:30:16,515
[SPEAKER_10]: That's just how things go.

1965
02:30:16,595 --> 02:30:19,977
[SPEAKER_16]: I just want to go to Boston, so I'm going to make packs.

1966
02:30:20,538 --> 02:30:27,242
[SPEAKER_16]: Especially considering everything we talked about in Part A this week, and you only live once and all that stuff, I want to visit Boston.

1967
02:30:27,282 --> 02:30:28,422
[SPEAKER_16]: It's the city I wanted to go to.

1968
02:30:28,462 --> 02:30:32,325
[SPEAKER_16]: I know a lot of great people from there I want to go visit, so I'm there.

1969
02:30:33,265 --> 02:30:34,266
[SPEAKER_16]: I'll make it happen one way or another.

1970
02:30:35,199 --> 02:30:35,499
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura.com

1971
02:30:53,168 --> 02:30:53,889
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1972
02:31:16,045 --> 02:31:29,128
[SPEAKER_10]: I really do appreciate you going into the current news sometimes because really I listen to OLR for the randomness that can pop up along with the mixture of the gaming news and you're not afraid to just have fun sometimes so I just wanted to let you know that.

1973
02:31:29,668 --> 02:31:39,030
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, thank you very much and certainly this is always an evolving show and if our listeners want us to get back into doing more of the personal stories, then personal stories you shall have.

1974
02:31:40,086 --> 02:31:40,626
[SPEAKER_16]: So, alright.

1975
02:31:41,267 --> 02:31:42,228
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, we're going to let you go then.

1976
02:31:42,488 --> 02:31:43,549
[SPEAKER_16]: I'll let you go.

1977
02:31:43,809 --> 02:31:44,029
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

1978
02:31:44,309 --> 02:31:45,450
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you so much for the call, buddy.

1979
02:31:45,710 --> 02:31:46,130
[SPEAKER_16]: Take care.

1980
02:31:46,331 --> 02:31:47,231
[SPEAKER_16]: Have fun in your podcast.

1981
02:31:47,291 --> 02:31:47,531
[SPEAKER_16]: Later.

1982
02:31:47,551 --> 02:31:48,432
[SPEAKER_16]: Have a nice show, guys.

1983
02:31:48,872 --> 02:31:50,874
[SPEAKER_16]: Later, dude.

1984
02:31:50,894 --> 02:31:52,815
[SPEAKER_16]: 1-877-GAME-OLR is the place to call.

1985
02:31:53,556 --> 02:31:54,496
[SPEAKER_16]: Let's try going back to the phones.

1986
02:31:54,537 --> 02:31:55,397
[SPEAKER_16]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

1987
02:31:55,417 --> 02:31:55,757
[SPEAKER_16]: Who's this?

1988
02:31:56,498 --> 02:31:57,158
[SPEAKER_16]: It's GS68.

1989
02:31:57,299 --> 02:31:58,059
[SPEAKER_16]: Hi.

1990
02:31:58,099 --> 02:31:58,740
[SPEAKER_09]: What's on your mind, buddy?

1991
02:31:59,885 --> 02:32:03,208
[SPEAKER_09]: I came back from the Philippines and wanted to share my arcade side of the things.

1992
02:32:03,449 --> 02:32:04,650
[SPEAKER_09]: You came back from where, I'm sorry?

1993
02:32:05,130 --> 02:32:05,751
[SPEAKER_09]: The Philippines.

1994
02:32:06,171 --> 02:32:07,592
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, the Philippines, that's right.

1995
02:32:07,693 --> 02:32:11,096
[SPEAKER_16]: I think I saw something on your Facebook about you were going out there.

1996
02:32:11,216 --> 02:32:14,919
[SPEAKER_16]: Believe it or not, I actually read the status updates on Facebook and Twitter and all that stuff.

1997
02:32:15,600 --> 02:32:16,140
[SPEAKER_16]: How was it?

1998
02:32:17,181 --> 02:32:19,904
[SPEAKER_09]: It was alright, though.

1999
02:32:19,944 --> 02:32:21,866
[SPEAKER_09]: The arcades here weren't as good as last time.

2000
02:32:22,106 --> 02:32:23,167
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe not as good as I expected.

2001
02:32:24,617 --> 02:32:25,298
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, you know what?

2002
02:32:25,338 --> 02:32:28,959
[SPEAKER_16]: It's because the arcades over here probably aren't as good as you remember either.

2003
02:32:29,760 --> 02:32:34,602
[SPEAKER_09]: They still have some games that I haven't seen on this side of the Pacific Rim years.

2004
02:32:37,223 --> 02:32:42,105
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, for example, Mario Kart Arcade GP with card slots.

2005
02:32:42,706 --> 02:32:46,167
[SPEAKER_09]: But what really surprised me when I was there was House of the Dead EX.

2006
02:32:47,588 --> 02:32:48,528
[SPEAKER_09]: Hmm, how was that?

2007
02:32:49,509 --> 02:32:50,169
[SPEAKER_09]: Basically, it's...

2008
02:32:51,434 --> 02:33:01,998
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just a bit of a House of the Dead, but they drew it in a cartoony style, and you probably won't believe what I'm about to say, but basically the storyline of the game is a zombie romance.

2009
02:33:03,599 --> 02:33:04,539
[SPEAKER_16]: That sounds awesome.

2010
02:33:04,919 --> 02:33:06,039
[SPEAKER_16]: Zombie romance movie.

2011
02:33:06,079 --> 02:33:07,480
[SPEAKER_16]: Now that's a movie that we need.

2012
02:33:07,780 --> 02:33:08,740
[SPEAKER_16]: Who wouldn't go see that movie?

2013
02:33:08,760 --> 02:33:17,824
[SPEAKER_09]: It's about this zombie girl who falls in love with her prison guard or whatever, and they escape, and you have to...

2014
02:33:19,432 --> 02:33:29,360
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's basically a bunch of minigames where you have to do things like catch fruit or shoot the bad teeth off of the stage 1 boss of House of the Dead 4.

2015
02:33:29,500 --> 02:33:36,245
[SPEAKER_16]: I thought for a minute there you were about to get into lesbian zombie romance because that was the only way this story was going to get even that much better, but that's okay.

2016
02:33:36,325 --> 02:33:37,346
[SPEAKER_16]: Unfortunately, no.

2017
02:33:37,666 --> 02:33:39,027
[SPEAKER_16]: They can do that in the sequel, that's alright.

2018
02:33:40,988 --> 02:33:43,110
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's going through a phase and I...

2019
02:33:44,090 --> 02:33:50,954
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, as I mentioned, I saw some games that I haven't seen in years, like F-Zero AX, and... Oh, I love F-Zero AX.

2020
02:33:51,255 --> 02:33:53,876
[SPEAKER_16]: I gotta ask you real quick, though, real quick, since we don't have a whole lot of time tonight.

2021
02:33:53,896 --> 02:33:54,697
[SPEAKER_16]: What about music games?

2022
02:33:54,717 --> 02:33:56,058
[SPEAKER_16]: Because I know you're a big music game fan.

2023
02:33:56,138 --> 02:33:58,039
[SPEAKER_16]: Is there a big presence of music games in the Philippines?

2024
02:34:02,082 --> 02:34:02,342
[SPEAKER_16]: Hello?

2025
02:34:02,702 --> 02:34:05,284
[SPEAKER_16]: Is there a big presence of music games over in the Philippines?

2026
02:34:08,106 --> 02:34:08,286
[SPEAKER_16]: I lost...

2027
02:34:10,956 --> 02:34:13,878
[SPEAKER_16]: I think we are losing GS68's connection.

2028
02:34:13,958 --> 02:34:16,219
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know if that's on your end or our end.

2029
02:34:16,739 --> 02:34:17,960
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm going to have to let you go.

2030
02:34:18,040 --> 02:34:18,720
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm sorry.

2031
02:34:18,820 --> 02:34:23,482
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know what happened with that connection, but we'll hope maybe he'll call back later when the connection is a little better.

2032
02:34:23,842 --> 02:34:25,103
[SPEAKER_16]: In the meantime, let me get to another call.

2033
02:34:25,383 --> 02:34:26,324
[SPEAKER_16]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

2034
02:34:26,344 --> 02:34:26,684
[SPEAKER_16]: Who's this?

2035
02:34:26,964 --> 02:34:27,304
[SPEAKER_16]: Hello.

2036
02:34:27,604 --> 02:34:27,904
[SPEAKER_16]: Hi.

2037
02:34:28,045 --> 02:34:28,385
[SPEAKER_16]: Who's this?

2038
02:34:29,192 --> 02:34:30,152
[SPEAKER_16]: This is Leachim6.

2039
02:34:30,432 --> 02:34:31,573
[SPEAKER_16]: Hello, Leachim6.

2040
02:34:31,753 --> 02:34:32,773
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't recognize that name.

2041
02:34:32,813 --> 02:34:33,733
[SPEAKER_16]: Are you a first-time caller?

2042
02:34:34,713 --> 02:34:35,193
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes, I am.

2043
02:34:35,774 --> 02:34:36,474
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, welcome.

2044
02:34:36,494 --> 02:34:37,634
[SPEAKER_16]: What a heck of a night to call.

2045
02:34:38,234 --> 02:34:39,375
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, what's on your mind, buddy?

2046
02:34:40,155 --> 02:34:41,235
[SPEAKER_14]: Hey, I was wondering.

2047
02:34:41,355 --> 02:34:45,296
[SPEAKER_14]: I know you guys have addressed iPhone gaming and that sort of thing a little bit.

2048
02:34:45,936 --> 02:34:51,437
[SPEAKER_14]: But, you know, with the new 3.0 update, you can add new devices to it, like controllers and stuff.

2049
02:34:52,258 --> 02:34:52,958
[SPEAKER_14]: Have you guys seen that?

2050
02:34:54,218 --> 02:34:54,758
[SPEAKER_14]: I've seen this one.

2051
02:34:54,838 --> 02:34:56,599
[SPEAKER_14]: It's like a NES controller, but it's wireless.

2052
02:34:56,619 --> 02:34:57,239
[SPEAKER_14]: It's like the GameBoom.

2053
02:34:57,759 --> 02:35:00,160
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, you know, we were hearing about some of this stuff last week.

2054
02:35:00,300 --> 02:35:05,922
[SPEAKER_16]: I think there was a story that we kind of got into a little bit about, like, especially about some of the things that are going to be developing for it.

2055
02:35:06,183 --> 02:35:08,604
[SPEAKER_16]: But I wasn't under the impression that this crap was already out.

2056
02:35:08,664 --> 02:35:09,664
[SPEAKER_16]: You can already get this stuff.

2057
02:35:10,202 --> 02:35:10,842
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2058
02:35:32,249 --> 02:35:47,341
[SPEAKER_13]: and that seemed kind of stupid but the thing about it is they don't really have a standardized controller yet so you buy this controller but you have to wait for people to actually support this controller in their games but I have a question so it's a wireless bluetooth controller, right?

2059
02:35:47,681 --> 02:35:51,884
[SPEAKER_14]: that looks like a NES controller doesn't a lot of people already have one?

2060
02:35:51,904 --> 02:35:59,070
[SPEAKER_16]: it's called a Wiimote I guess those do run off bluetooth, don't they?

2061
02:35:59,090 --> 02:36:00,651
[SPEAKER_16]: because people have hooked them up to their computers

2062
02:36:00,936 --> 02:36:08,080
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, so you could, in theory, use a Wii Remote or Wii Classic Controller or something like that with that.

2063
02:36:08,480 --> 02:36:20,106
[SPEAKER_13]: If that's okay with Apple, if they can support something like that, or if they don't need to get approved with that, if they just support it in whatever game is coming out.

2064
02:36:21,246 --> 02:36:22,086
[SPEAKER_13]: I would think anything.

2065
02:36:22,126 --> 02:36:23,987
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, you probably won't see that.

2066
02:36:24,007 --> 02:36:24,408
[SPEAKER_13]: Here's my question.

2067
02:36:24,428 --> 02:36:29,931
[SPEAKER_16]: This other thing you're talking about, that whole device, the bone or the game bone, is that an Apple official thing?

2068
02:36:30,131 --> 02:36:30,231
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

2069
02:36:30,291 --> 02:36:31,491
[SPEAKER_16]: Or is that some third-party company?

2070
02:36:31,511 --> 02:36:31,952
[SPEAKER_16]: Third-party.

2071
02:36:32,152 --> 02:36:32,612
[SPEAKER_16]: Interesting.

2072
02:36:33,252 --> 02:36:37,575
[SPEAKER_16]: So that is interesting that that would come out, but see, Apple's so locked down with that kind of stuff.

2073
02:36:37,635 --> 02:36:42,877
[SPEAKER_16]: I bet it's just a matter of time before someone hacks the phone to read that type of thing.

2074
02:36:43,017 --> 02:36:44,498
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm surprised it hasn't happened yet.

2075
02:36:44,758 --> 02:36:48,300
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, the iPhone's been out for two or three years now, and we've had Bluetooth the whole time.

2076
02:36:48,340 --> 02:36:49,601
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm surprised it hasn't happened yet.

2077
02:36:49,781 --> 02:36:51,462
[SPEAKER_14]: Maybe no one sees the point.

2078
02:36:52,162 --> 02:36:56,164
[SPEAKER_16]: Because, you know, you can't really use a Wiimote on the iPhone with such a tiny little screen.

2079
02:36:56,504 --> 02:36:59,145
[SPEAKER_14]: That's the part that people are missing.

2080
02:36:59,565 --> 02:37:00,746
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't want to use motion control.

2081
02:37:00,806 --> 02:37:02,826
[SPEAKER_14]: I just want to use it as a NES controller for my NES emulator.

2082
02:37:03,627 --> 02:37:04,187
[SPEAKER_16]: That makes sense.

2083
02:37:05,227 --> 02:37:06,908
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm kind of surprised that hasn't happened.

2084
02:37:07,328 --> 02:37:09,969
[SPEAKER_16]: I think it's just because sometimes those iPhones are like Fort Knox to get into.

2085
02:37:10,430 --> 02:37:13,291
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, not that that's ever going to stop the hackers, right?

2086
02:37:13,311 --> 02:37:17,152
[SPEAKER_16]: Because how many times do they come out and say, This is unhackable!

2087
02:37:17,292 --> 02:37:18,113
[SPEAKER_16]: And then two days later, they're hacked.

2088
02:37:18,133 --> 02:37:18,533
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, I know, right?

2089
02:37:19,884 --> 02:37:24,908
[SPEAKER_14]: It just seems kind of pointless to me to have a NES emulator where my fingers cover the screen when I play.

2090
02:37:25,469 --> 02:37:32,795
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, now, sir, the legality of those NES emulators are a little questionable in the first place, so beggars cannot be choosers, my friend.

2091
02:37:33,275 --> 02:37:37,299
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, obviously, I'm using games that I ripped from my cartridges that I bought when I was seven.

2092
02:37:37,599 --> 02:37:38,520
[SPEAKER_16]: Of course, of course.

2093
02:37:39,681 --> 02:37:44,505
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, I'm sure it's a matter of time before the Wiimote thing is hacked, but, you know...

2094
02:37:45,822 --> 02:37:49,583
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know if iPhone's really that big of a gaming platform for me.

2095
02:37:49,763 --> 02:37:52,825
[SPEAKER_16]: iPhone is where I game when I'm sitting in the doctor's office waiting to be called in.

2096
02:37:54,445 --> 02:37:58,347
[SPEAKER_14]: I think you addressed that last week, actually, about how you're not really a portable gamer.

2097
02:37:58,807 --> 02:38:00,187
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, but maybe that's just me.

2098
02:38:01,488 --> 02:38:02,948
[SPEAKER_16]: All right, well, hey, thanks so much for the call.

2099
02:38:02,968 --> 02:38:04,729
[SPEAKER_16]: Any other quick things you wanted to say before we let you go?

2100
02:38:06,009 --> 02:38:06,310
[SPEAKER_16]: Not really.

2101
02:38:06,350 --> 02:38:08,190
[SPEAKER_16]: Just love you guys, and congratulations on seven years.

2102
02:38:08,390 --> 02:38:10,871
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, thank you very much, and you picked a hell of a first night to call in.

2103
02:38:10,911 --> 02:38:11,331
[SPEAKER_16]: You take care.

2104
02:38:12,452 --> 02:38:12,852
[SPEAKER_14]: Later, guys.

2105
02:38:14,355 --> 02:38:15,336
[SPEAKER_16]: That was a very nice phone call.

2106
02:38:39,708 --> 02:38:43,470
[SPEAKER_16]: Let's go to at least one more call here and then we'll wrap up the show in a moment.

2107
02:38:44,431 --> 02:38:47,793
[SPEAKER_11]: You picked the best last call to end the night off with.

2108
02:38:48,193 --> 02:38:49,554
[SPEAKER_16]: And who am I speaking to?

2109
02:38:49,874 --> 02:38:50,895
[SPEAKER_16]: Hello, Legend of Zaku.

2110
02:38:50,915 --> 02:38:51,655
[SPEAKER_16]: What's on your mind?

2111
02:38:52,956 --> 02:38:53,516
[SPEAKER_11]: Nothing much.

2112
02:38:53,617 --> 02:39:01,701
[SPEAKER_11]: Just trying to get through all the grief of what was last week and unfortunately earlier today.

2113
02:39:01,781 --> 02:39:04,543
[SPEAKER_11]: But I guess we've got to move on to bigger, better things.

2114
02:39:05,744 --> 02:39:09,026
[SPEAKER_11]: Basically, the reason I'm calling today is just to

2115
02:39:10,267 --> 02:39:22,569
[SPEAKER_11]: Bring up the fact that Id and Bethesda merged, which kind of surprised me because I never thought that John Carmack would actually sell out to any particular person.

2116
02:39:23,169 --> 02:39:33,091
[SPEAKER_11]: Aside from EA, which he's actually working with, but not to a company like Bethesda, the folks from Fallout, or Elder Scrolls.

2117
02:39:33,111 --> 02:39:37,232
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not saying that they're all bad and all, but I don't know, it kind of came out of nowhere.

2118
02:39:39,381 --> 02:39:49,826
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, yeah, I mean, yeah, we didn't really get into that on the show, but I guess that was a pretty big deal about, you know, ID and Bethesda kind of having their marriage going on there, but, um, uh, I don't know, like...

2119
02:39:51,514 --> 02:39:58,081
[SPEAKER_16]: Maybe I'm just not as big of a first-person shooter fan that I've been following ID all this time, but I know Bethesda makes some very pretty games.

2120
02:39:58,521 --> 02:40:01,544
[SPEAKER_16]: So certainly the two of them coming together is going to be very interesting.

2121
02:40:01,604 --> 02:40:02,104
[SPEAKER_16]: But you know what?

2122
02:40:02,144 --> 02:40:04,247
[SPEAKER_16]: When push comes to shove, money talks.

2123
02:40:04,627 --> 02:40:15,177
[SPEAKER_16]: And you may have thought that so-and-so was not going to be selling out, but when you've got bills to pay and you've got somebody who's buying this... As long as it still maintains some sort of creative control.

2124
02:40:15,217 --> 02:40:15,778
[SPEAKER_11]: In other words, if...

2125
02:40:17,360 --> 02:40:31,541
[SPEAKER_11]: as long as Bethesda is not pulling their chain to the point of choking them out creative wise that would probably make sense as long as they mutually respect each other on that level then they could easily be and everybody wins

2126
02:40:32,711 --> 02:40:57,069
[SPEAKER_16]: Bethesda makes pretty decent games though I mean like obviously you know Oblivion is huge, Fallout's huge I mean Elder Scrolls is pretty much their bread and butter that's what pretty much put them on the map right and but let's not forget Bethesda not every game they put out has been a huge success the Star Trek game that they did was not you know it's kind of mixed but at least it wasn't terrible you know mixed is better than terrible so their track record's pretty good overall so you know

2127
02:40:58,653 --> 02:41:08,056
[SPEAKER_16]: Even though it might be something you didn't imagine before, it's not like it's completely unreasonable that ID would go to a fairly respectable company like Bethesda.

2128
02:41:09,016 --> 02:41:27,242
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, as I said, it's all about whether or not John Carmack felt like it was something that he should have agreed with, something that I just hope he has confidence in his decision, or at least it itself is confident in the decision to merge with Bethesda.

2129
02:41:28,625 --> 02:41:37,993
[SPEAKER_11]: But aside from that, yeah, I can't actually end off the call without making a notable mention of Michael Jackson's contribution to video games.

2130
02:41:38,413 --> 02:41:54,487
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, aside from Moonwalker, the fact that he contributed to Sonic 3, Space Channel 5, I don't know, I guess we could never really know of how much success this man has because he's pretty much proven himself

2131
02:41:55,066 --> 02:42:02,668
[SPEAKER_11]: God knows how many times, on all fronts, not only on the stage or on the recording studio, but in our consoles.

2132
02:42:04,288 --> 02:42:08,709
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, you know, Michael Jackson certainly was involved with Sega.

2133
02:42:08,789 --> 02:42:16,951
[SPEAKER_16]: He had a lot of love for Sega, and I think we would all roll over if they would just put out a Moonwalker 2, but sadly it is just not meant to be.

2134
02:42:17,971 --> 02:42:19,872
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I just hope, you know...

2135
02:42:20,848 --> 02:42:22,429
[SPEAKER_11]: The Legal Mess is just the tip of the iceberg

2136
02:42:43,297 --> 02:42:49,321
[SPEAKER_16]: And I also want to clarify, it's not that Michael Jackson's Moonwalker was really that great of a game.

2137
02:42:49,341 --> 02:42:51,623
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, the arcade version, obviously.

2138
02:42:52,043 --> 02:42:53,624
[SPEAKER_16]: Genesis was kind of alright.

2139
02:42:53,965 --> 02:42:56,506
[SPEAKER_16]: It was a freaking video game made out of smooth criminal.

2140
02:42:56,626 --> 02:42:57,767
[SPEAKER_16]: That's what was cool about it.

2141
02:42:57,967 --> 02:43:05,833
[SPEAKER_11]: But at least he made everybody dance, whether it be criminals, robots, or even vicious guard dogs dance when he did his magic dance.

2142
02:43:07,199 --> 02:43:09,180
[SPEAKER_16]: You can't ignore that.

2143
02:43:09,260 --> 02:43:16,422
[SPEAKER_16]: Even if you hate music, which I don't know anyone that says I hate all music, you can't ignore the contributions that Michael Jackson made to gaming.

2144
02:43:16,942 --> 02:43:20,943
[SPEAKER_11]: I would buy it again just on the fact that he can make the dogs dance.

2145
02:43:21,944 --> 02:43:22,864
[SPEAKER_11]: We're going to let you go, buddy.

2146
02:43:23,104 --> 02:43:23,924
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks so much for the call.

2147
02:43:24,484 --> 02:43:25,004
[SPEAKER_11]: One more thing.

2148
02:43:25,465 --> 02:43:26,585
[SPEAKER_11]: Happy anniversary, guys.

2149
02:43:26,625 --> 02:43:28,826
[SPEAKER_11]: I know I forgot to mention that.

2150
02:43:29,766 --> 02:43:30,946
[SPEAKER_11]: Seven more years, hopefully.

2151
02:43:32,027 --> 02:43:32,507
[SPEAKER_16]: We'll see.

2152
02:43:32,567 --> 02:43:32,847
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know.

2153
02:43:32,867 --> 02:43:34,127
[SPEAKER_16]: I'd be 38 at that point.

2154
02:43:35,328 --> 02:43:35,868
[SPEAKER_16]: Take care, buddy.

2155
02:43:36,567 --> 02:43:36,847
[SPEAKER_16]: Bye!

2156
02:43:57,657 --> 02:43:58,158
[SPEAKER_16]: Spacemichael

2157
02:44:07,901 --> 02:44:08,161
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

2158
02:44:08,201 --> 02:44:08,441
[SPEAKER_16]: Huge.

2159
02:44:08,682 --> 02:44:11,384
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, he had a bigger part in Space Shuttle 5 too.

2160
02:44:11,524 --> 02:44:13,105
[SPEAKER_07]: There was the whole dance scene.

2161
02:44:13,465 --> 02:44:14,166
[SPEAKER_16]: That was pretty cool.

2162
02:44:14,526 --> 02:44:14,726
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.

2163
02:44:14,806 --> 02:44:16,368
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, good times, good times.

2164
02:44:16,848 --> 02:44:17,108
[SPEAKER_16]: All right.

2165
02:44:17,168 --> 02:44:21,091
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, gosh, it's about time for us to wrap up and get the hell on out of here for the night.

2166
02:44:21,852 --> 02:44:25,695
[SPEAKER_16]: But before we do that, we have to go around and get everybody's final thought.

2167
02:44:26,295 --> 02:44:28,076
[SPEAKER_16]: And I think, do we get all the last minute stories out of the way?

2168
02:44:28,097 --> 02:44:29,858
[SPEAKER_16]: I think we covered everything we were going to cover tonight, right?

2169
02:44:29,978 --> 02:44:30,478
[SPEAKER_06]: Pretty sure.

2170
02:44:30,799 --> 02:44:31,039
[SPEAKER_16]: All right.

2171
02:44:31,319 --> 02:44:32,860
[SPEAKER_16]: Then let's go around and get everybody's final thought.

2172
02:44:33,160 --> 02:44:34,601
[SPEAKER_16]: DarkSagra, why don't you start us off tonight?

2173
02:44:34,642 --> 02:44:35,182
[SPEAKER_16]: Your final thought.

2174
02:44:35,442 --> 02:44:37,944
[SPEAKER_07]: Seiken Densetsu 3 is a freaking epic RPG.

2175
02:44:38,824 --> 02:44:40,706
[SPEAKER_16]: They really need to give that an official release already.

2176
02:44:40,786 --> 02:44:41,586
[SPEAKER_16]: Just put it on WiiWare.

2177
02:44:42,067 --> 02:44:42,427
[SPEAKER_16]: For real.

2178
02:44:42,627 --> 02:44:42,907
[SPEAKER_16]: Really.

2179
02:44:43,408 --> 02:44:49,972
[SPEAKER_16]: My final thought is I really need to finish the Rydia after years because the new episodes come out like in a week.

2180
02:44:50,613 --> 02:44:52,754
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, just over a week and I'm not ready for them yet.

2181
02:44:52,774 --> 02:44:53,935
[SPEAKER_16]: I need to finish where I'm at right now.

2182
02:44:54,315 --> 02:44:55,456
[SPEAKER_16]: So, yep.

2183
02:44:56,597 --> 02:44:57,737
[SPEAKER_13]: Loki, your final thought tonight?

2184
02:44:58,318 --> 02:45:02,721
[SPEAKER_13]: My final thought is that I need to play more Fuel.

2185
02:45:04,980 --> 02:45:07,022
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes you do, I need to kick your butt at Fuel.

2186
02:45:07,582 --> 02:45:08,803
[SPEAKER_16]: Be fun.

2187
02:45:09,644 --> 02:45:14,388
[SPEAKER_16]: Actually, we need to go exploring for Vista Points, although I guess it's not really a cooperative type of game.

2188
02:45:14,648 --> 02:45:16,790
[SPEAKER_16]: Pretty tough to play that co-op.

2189
02:45:17,651 --> 02:45:18,932
[SPEAKER_16]: That's it guys, we're out of here.

2190
02:45:18,992 --> 02:45:22,455
[SPEAKER_16]: We are going to close up, and as we have said for the past seven years,

2191
02:45:22,995 --> 02:45:25,677
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you guys for tuning in to Orange Lounge Radio.

2192
02:45:25,737 --> 02:45:27,258
[SPEAKER_16]: It's your support that keeps us going.

2193
02:45:27,819 --> 02:45:30,081
[SPEAKER_16]: And let's see if we can make it to eight.

2194
02:45:30,181 --> 02:45:30,981
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm pretty sure we will.

2195
02:45:31,662 --> 02:45:36,165
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you guys so much for tuning in to us and listening to the show tonight, whether it be live, whether it be on the podcast.

2198
02:45:50,296 --> 02:45:53,118
[SPEAKER_16]: Tell two people about the show and spread the word because word of mouth is all we got.

2199
02:45:53,418 --> 02:45:54,959
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you guys so much for seven years.

2200
02:45:55,759 --> 02:45:57,420
[SPEAKER_16]: We'll try our best to do seven more.

2201
02:45:58,021 --> 02:45:59,041
[SPEAKER_16]: We'll see if we can make it.

2202
02:45:59,541 --> 02:46:03,023
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you guys so much and we'll see you next time here on Orange Lounge Radio.

2203
02:46:03,884 --> 02:46:06,706
