Orange Lounge Radio

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:13,000
We're your hosts, DarkSakura, Sky and Loco UK

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Tonight, June 28, 2009, we kick back and celebrate 7 years of Orange Lounge Radio with all of our listeners

4
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Orange Lounge Radio

5
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio

6
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
We are that video game talk show dedicated of course to video games

7
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Video gaming, gaming culture and the gamer lifestyle

8
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
We like to say it's a place where every gamer has a voice

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
But it's going to be these three voices walking you through the next few hours here

10
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
When we tape live on all games radio

11
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Myself, Rob Roberts and the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summer is here as well

12
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Hi

13
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
How are you?

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Beat

15
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
It's hot, it is hot in Sacramento today

16
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
It was 107 last time that I checked

17
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:13,000
And today was my walking evaluation, but we got to stay inside the air conditioning

18
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Yeah, I was going to say, that's pretty cruel making me walk outside in the heat

19
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Our teacher is like, there's no way in hell I'm making you guys go outside, we'll go break into the cardio room

20
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Fun

21
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
And also say hello to Techmaster Loki

22
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Hello

23
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
How are you doing Loki?

24
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Good

25
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Stay indoors today?

26
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Yeah, I painted baseboards

27
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Fun, being a homeowner rocks doesn't it?

28
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Yeah

29
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Awesome

30
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
And then I remember you said something about not being able to get shows

31
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I'm sorry, stories for the show tonight

32
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Yeah, because the internet was there, Comcast is working on improving their network in our neighborhood

33
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I don't know what that exactly means

34
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
So your house is just broken right now?

35
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Today at least, it's alright

36
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Well hey guys, it is the seventh year anniversary of Orange Lounge Radio believe it or not

37
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
We've been talking about it for a couple weeks now

38
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Kind of hyping it up a little bit

39
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
And sure enough, we started this little program

40
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,000
The very first episode was June 23, 2002

41
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Which means this week we hit seven years of Orange Lounge Radio

42
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
And that's with no major breaks

43
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I mean sure, a week here and a week there

44
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I think maybe a two week break happened once or twice

45
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,000
But honestly, we've been running pretty regularly with no extended breaks

46
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Through that whole time

47
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
So that is kind of an accomplishment

48
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
So we can admit it

49
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
We can take a minute to say

50
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Thanks to all of you for helping make it happen

51
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Because I'll tell you what, that very first show, the very first night, episode number one

52
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
We had twelve people listening

53
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:43,000
And now on AllGames.com, when we tape live, we get as many as thirteen

54
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
So we've really grown

55
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
No, I'm just kidding, obviously we have a little more than that

56
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
But it's just been great

57
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
You guys really have taken that to heart, what we say at the end of every show

58
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
To just tell more people about our show

59
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
And it's worked and we've grown a little bit

60
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,000
So thank you guys so much for helping us reach seven years of Orange Lounge Radio

61
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Here's the funny thing about tonight's show

62
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
It's been a really crazy week for all of us

63
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
I think personally and everything else

64
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Just like the show a couple of weeks ago

65
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
We didn't really prepare a list of topics to talk about

66
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
But here's the thing

67
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Two weeks ago, we had E3

68
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
That made it easy

69
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,000
We had three hours to talk all about E3 and what happened there

70
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Tonight, not so much

71
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
So we're going to just do it the old fashioned way

72
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Because this is the way we did the show for many, many years

73
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
So we're going to see if we've still got it in us

74
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
And we're just going to wing it, folks

75
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Here at Orange Lounge Radio

76
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
We're just going to wing it tonight

77
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,000
We've started assigning positions as if Orange Lounge was a starship

78
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Yes, and what's your position?

79
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Captain

80
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
What's my position?

81
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
First officer, because you have to talk to everybody and be my voice

82
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
What would be Loki's position?

83
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Oh, Worf

84
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
We've given Loki's security officer position

85
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Because he's the most aggressive of us all

86
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
And Jason is our ship's engineer

87
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Deep Man kind of does that too, though

88
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Well no, Jason would be like the engineer

89
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Deep Man's kind of the person that would actually

90
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Science officer?

91
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Okay

92
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
He can be our science officer

93
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Like data?

94
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Data

95
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Yeah

96
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
And then that means that

97
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Because I was going to say that Tiara was our science officer

98
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
But I'm going to make her

99
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Sulu

100
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
She's our Sulu

101
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
She can be our Sulu

102
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Oh my

103
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
No, Deep Man can be our Uhura

104
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Because he does so much communication stuff for us

105
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
He's our communications officer

106
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
So Sos could be our science officer

107
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
And then our Sulu is Misty

108
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Okay

109
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
She can drive us

110
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Now is there a farting officer?

111
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Because we need Rice Princess to have a role

112
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Chris is ship's lesbian

113
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Official ship's lesbian

114
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Okay

115
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Would she be the Troy?

116
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Rice Princess can be our check off

117
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
So she can scream at people

118
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Okay

119
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
And

120
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I like this

121
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,000
And do like our advanced calculations and stuff

122
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
But we need a ship's counselor

123
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Now everybody in chat is screaming, you know

124
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Who's going to be Quark?

125
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Who's going to be Scotty?

126
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Who's the doctor?

127
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
This isn't DS9, hello?

128
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
We don't have Quark

129
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
We have somebody called the doctor already

130
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
So I don't

131
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
The doctor would be the doctor, silly

132
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Ship's doctor will be Sherby

133
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Alright

134
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Meow meow

135
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Alright

136
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
She's ship's cat

137
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Let's do what we used to do here on the show

138
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
And instead of talking just about games

139
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Ooh, Patty and Sulu

140
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Get away from the damn Star Trek for a minute

141
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
There's some folks that don't even like Trek listening to the show

142
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Oh, Game Guru said that Loki's our red shirt

143
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Hey, if you want to

144
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
That's not very nice

145
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,000
If you want to join the chat room and scream Star Trek obscenities with the rest of our chat

146
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
chat.orangelaunchradio.com is the place to be

147
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
When we tape live on Sunday nights at All Games Radio

148
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
At 6 o'clock Pacific Standard Time

149
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:51,000
9 o'clock Eastern Time right after the Bobby Black Wolf show on Sunday nights

150
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Let's go around and hear a little bit about

151
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I've been changed up a little bit tonight

152
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Because you know what, we've been doing this 7 years

153
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
If we want to talk about ourselves a little bit tonight

154
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Get away from the games a bit

155
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
We can do that

156
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
We're going to do how was your day, how was your week tonight

157
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Not just, you know, throw games into it

158
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
I'm sure you've played some stuff too, but

159
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Dark Soccer, we'll start with you as we always do

160
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
How was your day, how was your week?

161
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
My day was hot

162
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
And kind of crappy

163
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Um, also I left something, oh here it is

164
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Um, yes, to, I've been in a lot of pain

165
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
From my finger, so tomorrow I'm having surgery

166
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Done on it at 7 in the fucking morning

167
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
On my day off

168
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Because I'm now officially on leave from work for a month

169
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Congrats

170
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Aww

171
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
With disability pay

172
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Um, but no really, I've needed my finger surgery done

173
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
I was supposed to have it done at the end of July

174
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
She's going on the dole

175
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Well, I, they, they, someone cancelled

176
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
And so I was able to get it done tomorrow

177
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
And that is such a blessing

178
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Surgery's important though

179
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Yeah, it's a 30 minute procedure

180
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
I'm going to be awake through the whole thing

181
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Oh my gosh

182
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
But I won't feel, they won't let me watch, bastards

183
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
So, anyway

184
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Um, as it's, as it's going, um

185
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,000
I've kind of, it sort of really hit me kind of hard this morning

186
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
So I've been kind of pissy

187
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Try not to be pissy, I've tried to stay in a good mood

188
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:14,000
But unfortunately, when you're pissy, there's not a lot that keep you from just being pissy, you know

189
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
So I'm supposed to go to a birthday party today

190
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Because Julie's birthday was, um, Thursday

191
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
And yours was Friday, so happy birthday

192
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Indeed it was, thank you

193
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
I'm sorry, I couldn't make it

194
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
That's okay, I didn't have a lot of stuff

195
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
I called you

196
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Yeah, you did

197
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
And we've got plans later this week

198
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Yes

199
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
And you need to meet the BF and all that fun stuff

200
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
So we'll, we'll take care of that later this week

201
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Indian food while I'm high is a kite, that should be funny

202
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Um

203
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:41,000
I just want to read from DJ Morpheus in chat, our old buddy who hosts, uh, Under Sedation Live

204
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Which, you know, if there's one show that's been in existence longer than Orange Lounge Radio, it's Under Sedation Live

205
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Now granted, they had some big breaks, but we got our big break on Under Sedation Live

206
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
I do not have to learn to play with myself with my other hand

207
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
That's why God made toys

208
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Those are the kinds of things that, uh, DJ Morpheus will throw out there on Saturday nights right here on All Games Radio

209
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Where he tapes his show now

210
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,000
I do want to also point out, he did say, hope they cut open the right body part

211
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Cause that would kind of suck to go in there and then like, you know, suddenly you come out of there and you have bigger boobs

212
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:15,000
They could cut open the wrong body part and take out part of it, that'd be happy

213
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Alright

214
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Um, anyway, as far as, uh, my week

215
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Yes

216
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Um

217
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
I was at work

218
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
It kind of sucked

219
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
And I was in a lot of pain, which sucked too

220
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:33,000
And, um, I walked and I, um, yeah

221
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Tell us a little bit about the condition, because I think, you know, you haven't talked a lot about playing games yourself on the show in probably the past six months

222
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:47,000
And, I mean, granted you've had some on the DSSF, but I think people don't understand that you have something up with your hand

223
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Like you can't really do the controllers for very long

224
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
So

225
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:55,000
It actually, I'll tell you what hurts most about playing a game is, um

226
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
And by the way, um, I agree with Travis, he is our cue

227
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Um, what, it's called flexor tendonitis

228
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Um, so to translate it means that the, you know, when you flex your muscles, when you flex your fingers you're bending them

229
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:18,000
If you straighten them out you're extending, so it's in the tendons that bend the muscles

230
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,000
And, um, those muscles, of course, are in your forearm

231
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
And the tendons run from your forearm to your finger

232
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:31,000
And, um, it's my middle two fingers of my right hand, my, uh, my flipping off everybody because they suck finger

233
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
And my not getting married finger, which is the other hand

234
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
So, um, it's on my right hand

235
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:42,000
So, um, anyway, those, the tendons that when they attach to the muscles in your fingers

236
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
There's a sheath around them of, uh, of tissue

237
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:49,000
You know, some of the kind of holds it in place so that they don't bow out, you know

238
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Like when you have a bow strung too tightly and the things start popping out

239
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Um, it keeps the tendons in place

240
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,000
And what happens is I have swelling on my hand

241
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:06,000
If you look at your palm, up above the center of your palm where the, the really fleshy part is right under your fingers

242
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Um, I have a knot on each tendon

243
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:12,000
And what happens is that if you imagine like a pulley

244
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:18,000
The knot gets caught on that sheath of skin going, on that sheath of tissue going into the fingers

245
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:24,000
And so when I try to straighten out my fingers, it pops, like it's shoving past that

246
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Like, like you're trying to fit something into a tube that's too small for it

247
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
You know what I mean?

248
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Uh, act deaf in our chat room says flex or tendinitis, it sounds like a DJ

249
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
A little bit

250
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Well, um, that, that's really, I think the best way I can describe it

251
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:43,000
So what they're gonna, gonna do is actually, um, cut my hand open

252
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:47,000
And it's just like they're, like they, um, open two little flaps on either side

253
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:56,000
And they're gonna snip the tendon sheath so that, that lump will have, won't have that tight of an area to go through

254
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Um, and what happens is that the tendon sheath will heal around the larger lump now

255
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,000
And, you know, most, it has a pretty high success rate

256
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:08,000
It's fairly, you know, it, it's a 30 minute procedure

257
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
I'm gonna be awake for it, they're just gonna numb it up

258
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Um, DJ Flexer

259
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,000
So they're circumcising your hand?

260
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
No, I'm not having skin removed from it

261
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
They're just making a little cut

262
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Um, but the whole problem as far as how it hurts is that now it's to the point that even when my fingers are straightened out

263
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:31,000
If I try to bend them, that lump, it's just so much swelling in my fingers

264
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Cause you can actually see it on my palm

265
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Well, I'm showing Rob

266
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Great radio

267
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,000
But, um, but it, it's visible on my palm now

268
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:42,000
And it's just not very, it hurts a lot actually

269
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
It's really sore

270
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
And the place where the lumps are on

271
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
You know what they say about folks with swelled palms?

272
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
They hurt?

273
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Nevermind

274
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Oh wait, that's hairy palms

275
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,000
You know what they say about, about, about men with big, with big feet?

276
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Uh, big socks?

277
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Big shoes

278
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Um, but, um, now, holding a controller now is me telling everyone right exactly where the, where the owies are

279
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Imagine having a piece of hard plastic shoved against swollen tendon tissue for, oh, longer than ten minutes

280
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Imagine not being able to bend your middle two fingers

281
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
It hurts to hold a fork

282
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:23,000
I can't hold, um, and, you know, you know I do graphic art and everything

283
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:27,000
I can't hold my stylus or a pen that isn't, like, a big child-sized fat highlighter

284
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Or, you know, smelly markers

285
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
For longer than ten minutes

286
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
And it's really getting in the way of my life

287
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:37,000
So, I'm just gonna say, cortisone, I've had two rounds of cortisone

288
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Two shots in each finger

289
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
I'm, I'm done

290
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,000
I'm ready just to have the surgery done and get it over with

291
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Well this is like real trauma in the ER type of thing

292
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Although it's not really an emergency, it's not bad

293
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
It's not a big procedure

294
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
It sounds a lot like what my mom had a couple years ago

295
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,000
She had her shoulder operated on and her shoulder was preventing her from painting

296
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,000
And I know that was really rough on her

297
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Because, you know, she's older, she's past 65 at this point

298
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,000
She's long retired from, you know, being a preschool teacher and nanny

299
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
The stuff she did

300
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
She likes to paint, that's how she passes the time

301
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
So having to have that surgery was rough for her

302
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
But now she can paint again and she's really happy

303
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
So soon you'll be able to play games again

304
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
The shitty thing that I'm having to put back on because my finger hurts

305
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,000
I'm glad I never have to wear it again after my stitches come out

306
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Although it is cool that you can flip people off just 24-7 with that thing

307
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Yeah, because it's basically a splint that straps to my wrist

308
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,000
And hangs on the outside of my hand over my middle finger

309
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,000
So I can't bend it, it forces it to stay relaxed

310
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Well I bet you can't wait for Project Natal because you won't need a controller for that

311
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
You can just wave your hand around like a lunatic

312
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
That would be fun

313
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Well I mean supposedly I could do that with the Wii mode if I played left-handed

314
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Which actually Wii games are surprisingly easy for me to play

315
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Because I haven't really had to do anything, you know

316
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:56,000
But like today when we were doing our exercises I couldn't do push-ups

317
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:01,000
So actually I had to use a ball, a weighted ball, and do reverse push-ups

318
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:05,000
I couldn't do the rowing because I couldn't grip anything

319
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:11,000
It's really, I mean people don't really realize exactly how much they use their hands

320
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Especially their dominant hand

321
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Until you're restricted in it

322
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:21,000
And it was just like, I would just sit and just sketch, you know, for stress relief

323
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Couldn't do it

324
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,000
I can't massage people except with my left hand

325
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Which fortunately enough my primary client, all of her problems are on her left side

326
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
So that's fine

327
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:38,000
But you know, it's just, it's gonna be an adjustment

328
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:42,000
But I'm absolutely relieved

329
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Well now were you able to get into any gaming at all?

330
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Oh yeah, I'll play Sims, I can still play Sims

331
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
After my surgery I can still play the hell out of Sims

332
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
And screw everything else

333
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
The mouse is a thumb trackball

334
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:57,000
So I can still, I still have the use of my first finger and I can still use my thumb

335
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Have you beat the Sims yet?

336
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
You don't beat the Sims

337
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
You do if they're bad

338
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,000
However, I made a Mii Sim

339
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,000
And the first thing I mastered was video gaming

340
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Is that actually a skill in the Sims?

341
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Yes, it's one of the hidden skills

342
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,000
You can just start playing video games and you can get up to level 10 master video games

343
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
What happens if you max out your video gaming skill?

344
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Do you become like Fatality and you get your own line of video cards and stuff?

345
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
No, you just are awesome

346
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:26,000
But Sim Mii is a professional writer

347
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
And a hacker

348
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Just because

349
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Alright, well

350
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Oh and I played Peggle

351
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
I'm glad to see Sims is going fun

352
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
I played Peggle on iPhone

353
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Yep, on iPhone

354
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
I'm glad they did that sale

355
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
That motivated me to buy it

356
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
And for people who are using Linux

357
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:50,000
They're actually a pretty good version of Breakout on Linux

358
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,000
I'm running Linux Mint on my laptop

359
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:57,000
And I like it that instead of using the arrow buttons to move your

360
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Your little bar around

361
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
You actually use the touchpad

362
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:06,000
It recognizes the touchpad and you can slide your finger back and forth to move your

363
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Your little

364
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Bounce bar

365
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
So that was pretty fun

366
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
I played

367
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
I was at Boston Market

368
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,000
And I was playing Breakout over Chicken at Boston Market

369
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Nice, Chicken and Breakout

370
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Yep

371
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Awesome

372
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
I am done

373
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Loki, how was your day? How was your week?

374
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
I'm tired

375
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
I guess

376
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Today I painted baseboards because

377
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
It needs to be done

378
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Because they're just primered white

379
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,000
I mean they look white but when you paint them it's a different color white

380
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
If that makes sense

381
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,000
So that's what I did today because I have to work on the house stuff

382
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:48,000
And then this week

383
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:53,000
I was trying to perfect the perfect modifications to Grand Theft Auto 4

384
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
And we have a working set now

385
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
It's Absolute Chaos

386
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
I mean

387
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:02,000
There's explosions going off everywhere consistently

388
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Basically we replaced a bunch of the weapons in the game

389
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Starting with the

390
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Desert Eagle now is a gun that shoots these little

391
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Vortex

392
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Blasts I guess that basically throw people into the air

393
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Or cars or just whatever you fire it at

394
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
And um

395
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
So that was basically the first thing I created

396
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Which was like a defensive weapon

397
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
And it works pretty good

398
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,000
And then we replaced the um

399
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:34,000
The Mac 11 with uh

400
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:38,000
It's a molotov launcher that fires lots of fire at people

401
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,000
And catches them on fire and cars on fire and you name it

402
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Then the MP5 which is the other Uzi in the game

403
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Now fires rapid fire grenades

404
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
And um

405
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
That just creates a ton of explosions

406
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,000
And then we replaced the molotov in the game

407
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Because you get that in multiplayer still

408
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
But since there's a molotov launcher already

409
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,000
I just made it create this giant explosion

410
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
That doesn't do any damage but throws everything everywhere

411
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
So that's kind of fun

412
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Real quick question from chat let me ask this

413
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Chat.orangelandradio.com live on this Sunday evening

414
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Loki is there any way we can download your mods

415
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
That's from SSG100 Matt

416
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,000
No I'd have to post a copy of the ISO on there

417
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
I guess I could post a copy of my modified files

418
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Then you just have to do the modifications yourself

419
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,000
And then you'd have to build your own ISO

420
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,000
And then burn it off and then play it on a modded 360

421
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
But um

422
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Yeah I could do that

423
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
But it's a lot of work

424
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
And then um let's see what else I do

425
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Oh uh the

426
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,000
The M4 now fires a bunch of rockets

427
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Which is kind of funny

428
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:45,000
But they don't exactly explode on impact

429
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
They just bounce around a lot

430
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Which is kind of funny

431
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,000
And then um

432
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Let's see what else

433
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
I think that's pretty much it as far as weapons go

434
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
It's just it's a lot of chaos

435
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
And then also the police car flies

436
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,000
And um like the bus

437
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
And the big vehicles basically are

438
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Um pretty dense

439
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
And they'll crash through anything and go really fast

440
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:10,000
So it's just it's really mixing up the game

441
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
And it right now because I mean

442
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
We've been playing Grand Theft Auto IV since it's come out

443
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
And hell we've been playing Grand Theft Auto games

444
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Since they've come out on the PSP

445
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
And they had multiplayer in them

446
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
So um

447
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Yeah it's just it's really

448
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Really fun

449
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
And I'm really looking forward to when they come out

450
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
With the two expansions on one disc

451
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Like they're going to be doing sometime in I think October

452
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
And uh when that happens it's going to be awesome

453
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Because not only will I be able to

454
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Because right now I can only modify the um

455
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Weapons that are part of the original game

456
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Like everything that's part of the expansion

457
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
You can't modify because

458
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Basically it will overwrite anything

459
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
With the stuff that's in the expansion

460
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Um that's on the disc

461
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
And you can't modify the expansion

462
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Because it's in a different file format

463
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
And that kind of thing

464
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
But when it's on the actual disc

465
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Then yes then I can hack crap out of it

466
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,000
And I'll be able to modify absolutely everything in the game

467
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Which will just be incredibly fun

468
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Um so beyond all that stuff

469
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Um I've been

470
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
You know just kind of unpacking

471
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
And

472
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
I don't know

473
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
I've really just been playing Grand Theft Auto this week

474
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Because I haven't had time to play much of anything else

475
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
But I have Wii Sports Resort

476
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
The Japanese one for Wii Motion Pluses now

477
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
You were mentioning that the other day

478
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
When you were over at my house for the birthday party

479
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
And for some reason we never got around to playing it

480
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
I guess just we were

481
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
On other tangents or what have you

482
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
But have you had a chance to crack it open and check it out yet?

483
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Nope

484
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Oh sad

485
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
I don't know

486
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
It's all in Japanese so I mean

487
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Well you should be able to crack your way through it though

488
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
I mean uh

489
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Yeah

490
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
When does that come out over here?

491
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
In um July 26th

492
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Damn it's a bummer we weren't still in the old studio

493
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
We could do a Justin TV thing

494
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Yeah

495
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
We'll have to figure something out

496
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Or we can still get it broadcast somehow

497
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Kinda check that out before it's launched over here

498
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Yeah it's no big deal

499
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Yeah I mean

500
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
I think

501
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:04,000
With Wii Sports it's more a lot of people have a curiosity about Wii Sports

502
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
That are actually like looking forward to it

503
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Have it pre-ordered

504
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
I don't know

505
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
I get the feeling our listener base

506
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,000
More curious about it before they're gonna plop down that kind of money

507
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
It's a good deal

508
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
I mean the game's gonna be pretty decent

509
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
And it's got 12 sports in it

510
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Plus you get Wii Motion Plus

511
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
So I mean hey if the game sucks

512
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
At least you have Wii Motion Plus

513
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:27,000
And you know as much I had to buy my Wii Motion Pluses at GameStop

514
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Just because that's where I ended up turning it into my game

515
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
So I had a lot of credit

516
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
And it was just games that I've had for a while

517
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Or gotten free from work like

518
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Really I'm not gonna play UFC or you know

519
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
I don't really give a crap about the Wheelman

520
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
So

521
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Wait so the Wii Motion Plus is already out

522
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Yes Wii Motion Plus is already out

523
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Oh interesting

524
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Because uh

525
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
There's nothing you can use it for

526
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
No there's three games

527
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
There's Tiger Woods 09

528
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
There's um EA Sports Grand Slam Tennis

529
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
And then there's also Virtua Tennis

530
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
Okay

531
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
2009 or 10 or whatever it is

532
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
That's right I remember the Tiger Woods game now

533
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Cause that has some other feature doesn't it

534
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
It doesn't that also have

535
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
That's Frisbee Golf

536
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Is that the person that has the Facebook

537
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Or is that on Xbox

538
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
Um

539
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
That's on Xbox

540
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
That's

541
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
They're talking

542
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
I think that was just more of an example

543
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
That's not actually being done yet

544
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
So much news

545
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Um

546
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
No but you can actually

547
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Play Frisbee Golf and stuff in Tiger Woods

548
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
2010

549
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
So that's kinda cool

550
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
And then

551
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
Um

552
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,000
Yeah but anyways

553
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
So I bought mine at

554
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Um

555
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
GameStop

556
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
And if you aren't using trading credit

557
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
Or you know

558
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Happen to getting

559
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
You know free games that

560
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Are really old and crappy

561
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000
That

562
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
You're just basically

563
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,000
Pay with cash or something like that

564
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
Don't go to GameStop

565
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
Cause they're charging

566
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
$5 over retail

567
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
They're charging

568
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
$25 for the Wii Motion Pluses

569
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
They retail at

570
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
$20

571
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,000
They know it

572
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
They just figure people are dumb

573
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000
And gonna buy it

574
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,000
And yes I was dumb

575
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,000
And bought it

576
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,000
But the only reason I bought it there

577
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,000
Was because

578
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
It didn't really cost me anything

579
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
Since I traded in

580
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Games I got for free

581
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,000
So

582
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
Who cares

583
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
You know

584
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,000
And really yeah

585
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
I could have gone to GameCrazy

586
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,000
Or something like that

587
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,000
But

588
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
I'm just not gonna drive the extra distance

589
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,000
And then go to someplace else

590
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
Other than GameStop

591
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
So

592
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,000
Who cares

593
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
But I did buy the last two that they had

594
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
So that was kinda cool

595
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,000
Um

596
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
And then I'm sure I'll eventually use them

597
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
But

598
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:14,000
I just haven't gotten around to it yet

599
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
But uh

600
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,000
Yeah

601
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,000
Just that's pretty much

602
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,000
I have a lot of games

603
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,000
You know

604
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
On deck I guess to play

605
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
And I just haven't really

606
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Gotten to it yet

607
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
But hopefully now I'm done messing with

608
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Grand Theft Auto 4 for a while

609
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,000
Cause I've really modified all that I can modify right now

610
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,000
Um

611
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
That I even wanna mess with so

612
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,000
That's

613
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,000
Where I'm probably gonna leave that

614
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
And then maybe I'll get into

615
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,000
Red Faction Guerrilla or Arma 2 this week or something

616
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,000
Alright

617
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,000
Well let's see

618
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,000
I'll start with games

619
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,000
And get into personal stuff

620
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,000
Um

621
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000
Let's see games I played this week

622
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,000
I've still been playing Fuel

623
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,000
I think I've played

624
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,000
I think I've played Fuel more than Loki has now

625
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,000
I know

626
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,000
I'm really

627
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,000
I keep wanting to go back to him

628
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,000
I've unlocked four zones now

629
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,000
Which is still nothing

630
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
I mean there's like 19 zones

631
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,000
There's

632
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,000
There's a lot

633
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,000
Of orange to peel

634
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,000
In Fuel

635
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,000
Uh

636
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,000
The world is so vast

637
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,000
How are the third and fourth zones

638
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,000
Cause what's the third one they unlock

639
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,000
Ah

640
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,000
The

641
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,000
It's in the middle

642
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,000
The Dry Run I think

643
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,000
Is the name of the third area or something

644
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,000
It's kinda towards the middle

645
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,000
It's to the right side of the first area

646
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,000
Okay

647
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,000
Uh

648
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,000
And then you unlock a fourth area

649
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,000
Right underneath that

650
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,000
I actually haven't played a lot

651
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,000
In the third and fourth areas

652
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,000
Because I'm still obsessively collecting

653
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,000
In the first two

654
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
And I learned about this little trick

655
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,000
That lets you use any car

656
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,000
In any race

657
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,000
If you hit the back button

658
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,000
At just the right time

659
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,000
When the race is about to start

660
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,000
You can actually play

661
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,000
SUV races with a bike

662
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,000
And so on

663
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,000
That's awesome

664
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,000
So yeah

665
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,000
I thought it was actually kinda cool

666
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,000
Um

667
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,000
It really helps in some of the races too

668
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,000
I guess you could say it's cheating

669
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,000
But whatever

670
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,000
Who cares

671
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,000
It's a glitch in the game

672
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,000
It's a silly game

673
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,000
You know

674
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,000
I don't think Fuel should be taken

675
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,000
seriously

676
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,000
But it's

677
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,000
It's big dumb stupid fun

678
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,000
Um

679
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,000
And the world

680
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,000
The world really is huge

681
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,000
Like you just

682
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,000
I can see though

683
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,000
Some of the reviews I've read say

684
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,000
You know

685
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,000
And I've talked about this game

686
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,000
It's probably going to my third week

687
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,000
Talking about this game

688
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,000
I don't wanna kinda

689
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,000
Reinvent the wheel here

690
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,000
But I think one of the most common

691
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
Negative things I've read in reviews

692
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,000
Is that

693
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
Yeah you have this big open world

694
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,000
But full of what

695
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
There's really not a lot in it

696
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,000
And I think

697
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,000
I kind of am getting

698
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
Getting to understand that point of view

699
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,000
A little more

700
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,000
I do find this game fun

701
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
I think a lot of the courses are pretty cool

702
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
There isn't a lot that really is

703
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
But at least in the first few areas

704
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,000
Have you gotten to any of the like

705
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
Weather things like tornadoes and stuff

706
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,000
Not the tornadoes and stuff

707
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,000
So that's where I'm hoping

708
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,000
I've seen

709
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,000
I've seen some screenshots of that

710
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,000
And that looks crazy

711
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
I did do a heavy wind type race

712
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
But all that did was kind of decrease my visibility

713
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
And put this weird filter on that just made it look like

714
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
Stuff was blowing in front of my car

715
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,000
And everything the whole time

716
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,000
It was

717
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,000
I don't know

718
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,000
Like

719
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,000
I

720
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,000
It's hard to recommend this game for

721
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,000
$60

722
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,000
But at the same time

723
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,000
I can't put it down

724
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,000
Like I don't know why

725
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
Like I'm obsessively collecting all the vista points

726
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,000
And all this stuff

727
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:52,000
Maybe it's because I'm not playing MMOs right now

728
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
But there's that MMO driving me

729
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
To obsessively collect things

730
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
That I don't really need

731
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,000
So here I am trying to

732
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,000
Like I've unlocked an achievement now

733
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,000
For getting 10 vista points

734
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
I think I'm up to like 12 vista points

735
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,000
And for some reason

736
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
That's like my big goal in this game right now

737
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,000
Is like okay

738
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,000
I gotta play the arcade races

739
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,000
Until I can get the doppler truck

740
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,000
That I can run into

741
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,000
To get the vista points

742
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,000
Because I want all the vista points

743
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:15,000
Because that's supposed to be the prettiest areas in the game

744
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,000
I'll tell you what

745
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,000
There is some neat stuff

746
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,000
Like one of the vista points

747
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,000
You remember how last week you were talking about

748
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,000
That you drive through

749
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,000
Like a forest fire

750
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,000
To get to one of the zones

751
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,000
Yeah

752
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,000
Well one of the vista points is like

753
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
On a hill overlooking that fire

754
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,000
So it's kinda neat

755
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,000
Huh

756
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,000
You usually have some really interesting areas

757
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,000
So

758
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,000
Um

759
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,000
Yeah

760
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,000
You know

761
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,000
It's such a hit and miss game

762
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
If you like arcade racers

763
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,000
Like I do

764
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,000
Like just big dumb stupid fun

765
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
I think you will get a kick out of this game

766
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
But I think fans of more realistic racers

767
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
Are gonna get driven nuts by this game

768
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
I will tell you the one thing that does drive me nuts

769
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,000
I installed fuel to my hard drive

770
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
And I think it's causing more crashes

771
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,000
Than ought to be there

772
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,000
Is that um

773
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
Like sometimes after I do a challenge

774
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
If I do a challenge right out of the camp

775
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,000
The game locks up on me

776
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
When I try to go back to free run

777
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,000
Really

778
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,000
The loading times are just

779
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
A little silly

780
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,000
You know you

781
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,000
You have to wait

782
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,000
When you move to a camp

783
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
And then when you load for the race

784
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,000
And then when you

785
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,000
You know

786
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,000
It's just like

787
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,000
I'm having to do a lot of unnecessary load times

788
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
Well the load times I think

789
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,000
For the races and stuff

790
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,000
Is because it's

791
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
Like warping you to a different part of the map

792
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,000
I get that

793
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,000
But why does it have to reload

794
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
When I change from one camp to another

795
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
If it's just a new menu

796
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,000
If I'm not gonna

797
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,000
Like

798
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,000
If I'm not gonna exit that menu

799
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,000
Well it

800
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
It's loading the actual area of the arc

801
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,000
Cause when you exit the menu

802
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,000
It doesn't have any load time

803
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,000
I don't think

804
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,000
Um

805
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,000
It just seems weird

806
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,000
The loading times are weird

807
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,000
But honestly you know

808
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,000
I don't

809
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,000
It's not a perfect game

810
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,000
It's

811
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,000
I'm

812
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,000
I am having fun with it

813
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,000
And I think that's what's most important

814
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,000
At the bottom line

815
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,000
I can be as critical as I want

816
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,000
Of a video game on these

817
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,000
You know

818
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,000
I've driven right through a tree

819
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,000
Like

820
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,000
There are some very big

821
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
Glaring bugs in this game

822
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,000
But I don't know

823
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,000
Yet I still have fun

824
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,000
Collecting all the stuff

825
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,000
I wish there was like a trick system

826
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,000
Or something in that

827
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
It's fun to drive the motorcycles too

828
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,000
Like you know

829
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
And despite the fact that there's this big world

830
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,000
Practically full of nothing

831
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,000
There are like these houses

832
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,000
That will have ramps on them

833
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,000
And you can like

834
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,000
Drive up the ramp

835
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,000
And fly off the house

836
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,000
And you're flying over the trees

837
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
There is some silly fun

838
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,000
Well all those ramp houses

839
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,000
Have like fuel on top of them

840
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
That you have to stop and get

841
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,000
Yeah

842
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,000
I usually don't stop for fuel

843
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,000
Like I'll try to run into it

844
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,000
If I'm driving by it

845
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,000
But otherwise

846
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,000
Yeah

847
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,000
It's funny when I play on Xbox Live

848
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,000
And turn Xbox Live on

849
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,000
There's like nobody around

850
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,000
Anywhere

851
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,000
Just because

852
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
I'm surprised they don't have a way

853
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,000
To turn that on by default

854
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
I think more people would be using it

855
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,000
If it was like Test Drive

856
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,000
Where it was on by default

857
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
You know what I mean

858
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,000
Yeah

859
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,000
Um

860
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,000
Let's see

861
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,000
Other games I've been playing this week

862
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,000
Magic the Gathering

863
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,000
I actually bought

864
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,000
Magic the Gathering on Xbox Live

865
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,000
Despite our little story

866
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,000
About it last week

867
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,000
And all the fun

868
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,000
I know

869
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,000
Dark Soccer is holding up the cards

870
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,000
We still have to have our duel

871
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,000
But you see

872
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,000
I need to remember how to play again

873
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
So that's why I downloaded the Xbox Live version

874
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,000
That was the little point

875
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,000
That we were going to play

876
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,000
Unpracticed

877
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,000
Oh my bad

878
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,000
Well I couldn't resist

879
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,000
I had to check it out

880
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,000
But um

881
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,000
Yeah

882
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,000
I mean

883
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,000
If you like the card game

884
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
It's a fairly faithful reinterpretation

885
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,000
I don't know

886
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,000
I

887
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,000
I still think

888
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,000
Nothing beats

889
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,000
The actual cards

890
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,000
For a card game

891
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,000
But

892
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,000
I guess they did a pretty good job

893
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,000
With the translation

894
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,000
I mean

895
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,000
You know what

896
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,000
Uno

897
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,000
I could make the same argument there

898
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,000
Uno's a card game

899
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,000
But it's still kind of fun on Xbox Live

900
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,000
Because you have the camera and everything

901
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,000
And I was surprised

902
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
Magic the Gathering has the camera built in too

903
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,000
I didn't realize that

904
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,000
So hooray

905
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,000
A game I can get used to

906
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,000
Out of my Xbox Live camera

907
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,000
I'm excited

908
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,000
Um

909
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,000
But yeah

910
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,000
The game itself

911
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,000
I suck at it

912
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
But I was able to at least beat the first guy

913
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,000
And uh

914
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,000
You know

915
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,000
It's cool

916
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
I was having a problem figuring out how to edit my deck though

917
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,000
It wasn't

918
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,000
It's not very intuitive in that regard

919
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:43,000
And I'm not looking forward to all the microtransactions

920
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,000
That I'm sure are to come with this

921
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,000
But

922
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,000
You know what

923
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,000
For what it is

924
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,000
And considering it's only ten bucks

925
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:51,000
When the card game itself can start to cost you a lot more

926
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,000
Very quickly

927
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,000
Uh

928
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,000
It's worth checking out

929
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,000
You know

930
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,000
They did put together the game very well

931
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,000
And for

932
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
A very freaking complicated card game

933
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,000
I mean

934
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,000
Face it

935
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,000
Magic the Gathering is complicated

936
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,000
And I think it says it best

937
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,000
In the

938
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,000
In the rules

939
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
That come up for some of the tournaments

940
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
In the Magic the Gathering game

941
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,000
Magic the Gathering

942
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,000
One of its unique features

943
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,000
Is that the cards

944
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,000
At one time or another

945
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
Break all the rules

946
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,000
All the rules can be broken

947
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,000
With the cards

948
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,000
In one way or another

949
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
That's what makes the game somewhat unique

950
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,000
And

951
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,000
To take that

952
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,000
And have to translate it

953
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,000
Into a video game

954
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
Into a logical flow chart

955
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,000
That relies on

956
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,000
Set rules

957
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,000
That cannot be broken

958
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
That's a pretty tough thing to accomplish

959
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,000
And they did a pretty good job

960
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:35,000
I did notice it did seem to flow a lot better

961
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:38,000
Than the old, old PC game

962
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,000
Which wasn't bad

963
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,000
I had a lot of fun with that

964
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
But it did seem like the game mechanic itself

965
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
Flew a lot better in Xbox Live

966
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,000
So I didn't play it enough

967
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,000
I need to play it more

968
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,000
But um

969
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,000
Early for

970
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,000
For an early review

971
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,000
I will say

972
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,000
I had a lot more fun with it

973
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
Than I was expecting to

974
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,000
As far as how was my week

975
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,000
How was my day

976
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,000
Um

977
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,000
Today was kind of neat

978
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
I went to Pride in San Francisco

979
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,000
Which is you know

980
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,000
Of course the big gay Pride parade there

981
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,000
They do every year in San Francisco

982
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:05,000
I used to not be a fan of gay Pride actually

983
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,000
Um

984
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:09,000
Because I hate how the media will show that

985
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
And that is the impression unfortunately

986
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
That a lot of folks out there have of gay people

987
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
Is that we're all drag queens

988
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:18,000
And we all like to run around in our g-strings

989
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,000
Uh

990
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,000
And you know assless leather chaps

991
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
You know wearing nothing but handcuffs

992
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,000
Um

993
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,000
And that is so not true

994
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,000
And uh

995
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,000
Definitely not me

996
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,000
Okay

997
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,000
That's for sure

998
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,000
Uh

999
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,000
Hey I don't have the body for that

1000
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,000
So uh

1001
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,000
You can thank yourselves ahead of time for that

1002
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,000
And B

1003
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,000
It's just not really you know

1004
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
Sure I've done Rocky Horror Picture Show

1005
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,000
For a long time

1006
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,000
But the rest of that

1007
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,000
You know the

1008
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
The big stuff they do out there

1009
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,000
I don't know

1010
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,000
It's just not me

1011
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,000
And I don't like the fact that it's

1012
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,000
The impression that some people get

1013
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,000
Because some people are naive

1014
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
So I used to kind of have a problem with it

1015
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,000
Because it was so excessive

1016
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,000
But let me tell you this

1017
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
In straight culture there's a lot of

1018
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,000
Excessive stuff as well

1019
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,000
I mean think about it

1020
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
Pride is no different from

1021
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
A Playboy mansion party

1022
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
The girls next door

1023
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
MTV's Spring Break

1024
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,000
Thank you very much

1025
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:06,000
How is that any worse than what goes on at Gay Pride?

1026
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
It's really not

1027
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,000
MTV's Spring Break is just as bad

1028
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
As anything you're going to see in San Francisco

1029
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
It's really

1030
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
I mean I haven't been to the parade there

1031
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
But I've been to the Castro Street Fair

1032
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:20,000
Which I've heard has almost a similar reputation

1033
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
And it was really

1034
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
Not that crazy

1035
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,000
There was some crazy

1036
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,000
It's not that shocking

1037
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,000
No it's just

1038
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,000
So you might see

1039
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,000
A topless lesbian

1040
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,000
Oh my gosh

1041
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,000
You see those in France

1042
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,000
Walking down the street

1043
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,000
You know

1044
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,000
I saw a couple of dudes

1045
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,000
Running around in some tight shorts

1046
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,000
But you know

1047
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,000
Topless lesbian

1048
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,000
Sweet

1049
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,000
Who?

1050
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,000
Brigitte Nielsen?

1051
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,000
No

1052
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,000
You know what

1053
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
And then I always see that argument

1054
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,000
What about straight pride?

1055
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
Well I mean like MTV's Spring Break

1056
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
Is a little bit of straight pride

1057
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,000
I think in a way

1058
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,000
But also I don't think pride

1059
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
Necessarily has to do with

1060
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,000
Just being gay

1061
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
I think it's about just being different

1062
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,000
At all

1063
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,000
Just being

1064
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,000
Just being

1065
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,000
Out and proud

1066
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,000
That doesn't necessarily mean

1067
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,000
Out of the closet

1068
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,000
And all that

1069
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,000
It just means

1070
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,000
You are who you are

1071
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,000
And you're damn proud of it

1072
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,000
And the hell with what other people think

1073
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
So I've come a long way

1074
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,000
In kind of accepting gay pride

1075
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
As part of the gay culture

1076
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
And I don't feel the gay shame

1077
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,000
That I used to

1078
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
I actually do still agree though

1079
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,000
With Patton Oswalt

1080
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
Is that the gay pride parade

1081
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:24,000
Should actually tour from state to state

1082
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,000
And go everywhere

1083
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,000
Instead of just the cities

1084
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,000
Where you're not really shocked

1085
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
By it existing

1086
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
Like Tuscaloosa

1087
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,000
Nice

1088
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,000
So yeah

1089
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,000
I did that today

1090
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,000
And that was cool

1091
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,000
Except for having to stand out

1092
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
In the blaring sun for like two hours

1093
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,000
Less cool

1094
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
But you're in San Francisco?

1095
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,000
It still was hot

1096
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,000
I mean even though it's San Francisco

1097
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,000
Right by the ocean

1098
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,000
You have a nice breeze

1099
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,000
It was still hot

1100
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,000
What was kind of cool

1101
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,000
Speaking of hot

1102
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
Gavin Newsom walked right by us

1103
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,000
He was like right there

1104
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,000
And Victoria

1105
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
Who hasn't been on the show in a long time

1106
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,000
Gavin Newsom

1107
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,000
He's the mayor of San Francisco

1108
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
And he's going to be running for governor

1109
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:01,000
In 2010

1110
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,000
He walked right by

1111
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,000
And Victoria exclaimed

1112
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,000
Oh my god he's even hotter in person

1113
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
I was thinking of someone else for some reason

1114
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:09,000
No he's very controversial

1115
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,000
But anyway

1116
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,000
I'm not going to get into politics too much in there

1117
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
But it was just kind of cool to see

1118
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
Someone that a lot of people know

1119
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
Right there

1120
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,000
Let's see

1121
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
The rest of my week outside of today

1122
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,000
I'm going to be honest

1123
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,000
I've had a very

1124
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,000
Bipolar week

1125
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
I've had a weird weird week

1126
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
My birthday was Friday

1127
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,000
Which was cool

1128
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,000
Because you know

1129
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,000
I got to see friends

1130
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,000
And hang out with folks

1131
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,000
And had a party

1132
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,000
Which oddly

1133
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,000
It's the first party I've had in like a year

1134
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
Where rock band and sing star

1135
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,000
Did not make an appearance

1136
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,000
And I had it in my car

1137
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,000
Shocking

1138
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,000
Right

1139
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,000
But I don't know what happened

1140
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
I think just everybody was just kind of into

1141
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,000
Just talking

1142
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,000
And you know

1143
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
The TV just hardly ever got turned on

1144
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,000
But for music

1145
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,000
On the cable music channels

1146
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,000
So it was just kind of like

1147
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,000
You know

1148
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,000
Just kind of a different type of party

1149
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,000
Which was cool

1150
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,000
Um

1151
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,000
Let's see

1152
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,000
And um

1153
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,000
As far as the rest of my week

1154
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,000
Okay look

1155
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,000
Like

1156
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
What a crazy week it's been

1157
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,000
Like um

1158
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
Especially if you're a Hollywood celebrity

1159
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,000
Right now

1160
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,000
Right

1161
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,000
And you might be wondering like

1162
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
I wonder if OLR is going to be doing a tribute tonight

1163
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,000
To uh

1164
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,000
The uh

1165
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,000
Uh

1166
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,000
Michael Jackson

1167
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,000
Or Farrah Fawcett

1168
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,000
Or Ed McMahon

1169
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,000
Or that infomercial guy

1170
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,000
What was his name

1171
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,000
Was that the Sham Wow guy

1172
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,000
Billy Mays

1173
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,000
Billy Mays

1174
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,000
I don't

1175
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,000
Obviously I don't follow this stuff

1176
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
I don't stay up late enough

1177
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,000
Um

1178
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,000
But okay so he passed away

1179
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
But see I've had a lot more weighing on my mind this week

1180
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,000
Because um

1181
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
Somebody I actually know

1182
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,000
Who I don't

1183
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:36,000
And one of the first questions I got asked about this was

1184
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,000
Has she been on the show before

1185
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,000
I don't believe she has

1186
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,000
Um

1187
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,000
Even in the few many years of the show

1188
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,000
I think a lot of people

1189
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,000
Um

1190
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,000
That are on the show know of her

1191
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,000
Um

1192
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,000
Her name was Beth

1193
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
And she passed away on Tuesday

1194
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:50,000
Which sadly was also the anniversary of the show

1195
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,000
And uh

1196
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,000
She passed away from swine flu

1197
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
Or H1N1 virus

1198
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
She'd been in the hospital for 11 days

1199
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,000
And uh

1200
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,000
Unfortunately used to come to

1201
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,000
Um

1202
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,000
Complications of swine flu

1203
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,000
Basically her

1204
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,000
I don't want to get into

1205
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,000
Gory detail

1206
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,000
But you know her kidneys failed

1207
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,000
Her lungs failed

1208
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,000
It just

1209
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,000
She was brain dead

1210
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,000
And that was the end of it

1211
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,000
So they um

1212
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,000
You know had to do what they did there

1213
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,000
And um

1214
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:15,000
It was just kind of the whole things kind of weird

1215
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
I don't really know how else to explain it

1216
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,000
Surreal

1217
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,000
It's very surreal

1218
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,000
I haven't really

1219
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:23,000
You know I'm not going to proclaim that I was Beth's BFF in the world

1220
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
But I really respected this woman

1221
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:28,000
And I saw what a motherly figure she was to all her gays

1222
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,000
And just people in general

1223
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,000
Not just the gays

1224
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,000
But you know people in general

1225
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:34,000
And just you know what an accepting fun person she was

1226
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
She was always like the type that lit up a room

1227
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,000
One thing I will never forget about Beth

1228
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:40,000
Is she was the first person to tell me

1229
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
When I was dating a certain ex of mine

1230
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
She was the first person to tell me

1231
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,000
You can do better than that

1232
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,000
Rob you can do better than that

1233
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,000
And

1234
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,000
She was right

1235
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:52,000
That's just her motherly instinct in her

1236
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,000
And um

1237
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
You know we lost a really great person this week

1238
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:58,000
To something we don't really understand

1239
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
Which is so weird

1240
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,000
Because you know

1241
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,000
And so many people have made fun of swine flu

1242
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,000
Myself included

1243
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,000
And just like

1244
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
Oh the media is blowing out of proportion

1245
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,000
It's this big epidemic

1246
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,000
And you know

1247
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,000
It's pandemic level six

1248
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,000
And all this stuff

1249
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,000
And you know a lot of us are kind of like

1250
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
Well more people die of the real flu

1251
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,000
But

1252
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
All it takes is one

1253
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,000
To really affect you

1254
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,000
And uh

1255
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,000
You know

1256
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,000
Whether she was

1257
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
She was the first person in Sacramento County

1258
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,000
To die

1259
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
Of H1N1

1260
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,000
And it's

1261
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:31,000
We still cannot comprehend the impact

1262
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,000
They're having a memorial for her next month

1263
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,000
July 25th

1264
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
And there's a part of me in my mind

1265
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,000
That

1266
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,000
I don't

1267
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:41,000
I'm treating this like a four year old deals with death

1268
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
I'm like literally thinking in my mind

1269
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
We're gonna go have a party

1270
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,000
We're gonna go hang with Beth

1271
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
They're throwing a fat party at Beth's house

1272
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,000
It's gonna rock

1273
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,000
But like

1274
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
There's a part of me that still doesn't get

1275
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
That she's like not here

1276
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,000
You know

1277
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:58,000
Because I think it's something that nobody understands

1278
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,000
Like H1N1

1279
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,000
That I'm not able to wrap my head around it this week

1280
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,000
So

1281
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:05,000
I apologize if I'm not

1282
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
As sympathetic to some of these celebrities

1283
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,000
That have passed on this week

1284
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,000
Folks that have contributed

1285
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,000
I don't think anyone blames you

1286
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,000
Well folks that have contributed great things to popular culture

1287
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
And so forth, etc

1288
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:19,000
I realize they don't blame me in the same way I don't blame them

1289
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,000
I'm a little sick of hearing about

1290
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,000
All these folks in the media and so forth

1291
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,000
I feel for their families

1292
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
I feel for what they're going through

1293
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
But I understand

1294
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:31,000
I'm coming to terms with why the media shoves this down our throat

1295
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:35,000
For the same reason why Beth was splashed over every local news station

1296
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,000
Here in Sacramento

1297
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,000
Is that

1298
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:42,000
I don't want to get too deep here on a video game talk show

1299
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
I'm sorry but this has been a lot that's been on my mind this week

1300
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
Seven years we do what we want right

1301
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:50,000
Death is something that we don't understand

1302
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:54,000
We have a lot of reasons and things that we try to come up with

1303
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,000
To explain it

1304
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
That's religion right

1305
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:00,000
But at the end of the day we don't really understand death

1306
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:03,000
So when it happens

1307
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,000
We do what we can

1308
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:09,000
To try and I guess understand it

1309
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,000
I don't know is there something you want to point out

1310
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,000
I actually wrote a blog post about it after

1311
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:17,000
Because the day that you posted about Beth

1312
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,000
One of my good friends at work

1313
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,000
We found out he died

1314
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,000
That's right

1315
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,000
And I found out that he had been a little sick

1316
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:26,000
But was just going to go see the doctor because he was experiencing heartburn

1317
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:30,000
But of course heartburn also was one of the first signs of a heart attack

1318
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:33,000
And he didn't come in on Monday

1319
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,000
And I actually was looking for him on Monday

1320
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,000
We had been talking about Linux

1321
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
And I was going to show him my laptop

1322
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:42,000
And we didn't see him we didn't hear from him

1323
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
He's always super good about calling in

1324
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,000
He's like the man there

1325
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:48,000
He knows so much about everything you know

1326
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
And just completely fun to be around

1327
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:54,000
And then Tuesday one of the people in his department

1328
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
Called his sister

1329
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
And so she sent her husband to go check on

1330
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
His name is Pete

1331
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:03,000
And went to go check on over at Pete's apartment

1332
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,000
And found him dead

1333
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,000
So

1334
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,000
And I freaked out

1335
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:12,000
And then of course that same afternoon is when I went in to have my consultation

1336
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,000
So

1337
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,000
But it's like I came home

1338
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:19,000
It was I think I actually wrote up my post on my blog

1339
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,000
And I'll link it in the chat if anyone wants to see it

1340
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,000
Just about getting it all out

1341
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,000
Because it's like you were saying

1342
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
And my own belief is that

1343
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
And this is again this to me I'm sorry for getting philosophical

1344
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
It just happens

1345
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,000
I don't think anyone singled out

1346
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:34,000
I don't think that there's any sort of cosmic vendetta

1347
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
I don't really believe in karma

1348
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
I want to make this very clear

1349
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
Because a lot of people even locally

1350
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
And reading comments on news stations and stuff misunderstand this

1351
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
I want to make some things clear

1352
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
Beth did not go to Mexico

1353
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
Beth went to Las Vegas but Beth did not go to Mexico

1354
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
Beth

1355
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
None of Beth's friends have this disease

1356
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:55,000
Those that live with her those that know her have been tested for it

1357
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:58,000
This is an isolated incident

1358
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
She was healthy

1359
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
Yes she was a little overweight

1360
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
But you know what so were most of Americans

1361
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
Welcome to the USA

1362
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:10,000
She was a healthy, fun loving, happy individual

1363
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:13,000
This has not been explained

1364
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,000
This may not be explained

1365
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,000
That's the weird thing about it

1366
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000
It happened

1367
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,000
Here's honestly this way

1368
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,000
That's really in my belief system

1369
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,000
Disasters

1370
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,000
Whether they be something like this

1371
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,000
Whether they be a hurricane

1372
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,000
Whether they be a flood

1373
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,000
I don't think that it's any

1374
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,000
Like God's punishing people

1375
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,000
I don't believe that God punishes people

1376
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,000
I think God's got way too many other things to do

1377
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,000
To deal with our petty little problems

1378
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,000
Honestly

1379
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,000
And so I don't believe

1380
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,000
That there's a great cosmic hand

1381
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,000
In the disasters or the good things that happen in life

1382
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,000
I think they just happen

1383
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,000
They're not in motion to happen

1384
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,000
They're not predestined

1385
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,000
This is how it happens

1386
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,000
She may not have had

1387
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,000
A good immune system

1388
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,000
As far as that goes

1389
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,000
Some people

1390
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,000
I've known people who have been

1391
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,000
Almost hospitalized

1392
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,000
From just plain old illnesses

1393
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,000
I had pneumonia for three months

1394
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,000
And it almost went in the hospital

1395
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,000
I just really think it just happens

1396
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,000
And the best way to deal with it

1397
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,000
Is just accept that it happens

1398
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,000
And remember the good parts

1399
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,000
I want to thank the chat room for being so supportive

1400
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,000
On our big tangent tonight

1401
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,000
Blue 22 in chat

1402
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,000
Death is the one topic that brings people together

1403
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,000
That's very true

1404
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,000
And some other folks sharing their own very personal stories

1405
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,000
About this whole thing

1406
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,000
And what's funny

1407
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,000
The way Dark Sakura explains it

1408
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,000
I don't want to belittle what she's saying

1409
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,000
Because I think she's right

1410
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,000
Is very similar to the way Sesame Street explains it

1411
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,000
Of the generation you and I come from

1412
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,000
Do you remember when Mr. Hooper died?

1413
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,000
I do

1414
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,000
That was a huge

1415
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,000
Thing in television at the time

1416
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,000
Because that actor who had played Mr. Hooper died

1417
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,000
And they had to explain that to the children

1418
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,000
Because I don't know how they do Sesame Street now

1419
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,000
But back then they kind of taped it

1420
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,000
Not live but

1421
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,000
It was only a couple weeks behind

1422
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,000
A little off the cuff too

1423
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,000
So they had to explain it

1424
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,000
And the way they explained it

1425
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,000
The actor was so upset about it

1426
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,000
Go watch this on YouTube

1427
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,000
You want to see one of the greatest television

1428
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,000
I am not fucking with you

1429
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,000
This is one of the greatest television moments ever

1430
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,000
Go look up

1431
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,000
I watch this live

1432
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,000
Go watch Big Bird and Mr. Hooper's death

1433
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,000
YouTube Mr. Hooper death

1434
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,000
You'll find it somewhere

1435
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,000
And watch how they explain it

1436
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,000
Because the way they explain it to Big Bird

1437
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,000
Is that he's wailing

1438
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,000
He's bawling

1439
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,000
And finally the only answer that he'll accept

1440
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,000
This is just something that happens

1441
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,000
Yeah

1442
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,000
Anyway

1443
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,000
I don't mean to get too off the subject

1444
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,000
But with the whole

1445
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,000
Tributes to Michael Jackson and all this stuff

1446
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,000
And all this stuff in the media and so forth

1447
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,000
I don't really want to join in

1448
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,000
But at the same time I understand

1449
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,000
Don't get me wrong

1450
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,000
The man made great contributions to popular culture

1451
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,000
Say what you will about his personal life

1452
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,000
His personal life

1453
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,000
Unless he broke, well whatever

1454
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,000
He is who he is

1455
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,000
Let's leave it at that

1456
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,000
But I think

1457
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,000
The reason why everybody's talking about it

1458
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,000
And the reason why it's in the media and all this other stuff

1459
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,000
Is that

1460
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,000
This topic kind of brings

1461
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,000
People closer together

1462
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,000
It kind of helps people try and understand

1463
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,000
What cannot be explained

1464
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,000
I mean

1465
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,000
Who hasn't heard a Michael Jackson song?

1466
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,000
Everybody has heard a fucking

1467
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,000
Michael Jackson song at some point in their life

1468
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,000
Unless they're deaf

1469
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,000
You know what I mean

1470
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,000
Even then you've probably seen him dance

1471
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,000
Okay

1472
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,000
You have somehow been influenced

1473
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,000
By this guy one way or the other

1474
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,000
So when somebody like that passes away

1475
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,000
There's definitely

1476
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,000
Everybody's going to feel that type of connection

1477
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,000
Like oh I remember that song

1478
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,000
Or oh I remember watching it on TV

1479
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,000
And like I'm not going to get to see that again

1480
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,000
Although that's not really the case

1481
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,000
Because the nice thing about being an artist

1482
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,000
Is the contributions you make live on

1483
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,000
Forever

1484
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,000
It feels like something that

1485
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,000
And I'm not going to say

1486
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,000
Because honestly once I got older

1487
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,000
I didn't really care for his stuff too much anymore

1488
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,000
But I had a Michael Jackson doll when I was little

1489
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,000
You know I grew up that way

1490
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:27,000
I had the Billie Jean poster on my wall

1491
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,000
You know when I was little

1492
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,000
It's when you have

1493
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,000
An icon like that

1494
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,000
That is a part of

1495
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,000
What formed who you are

1496
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,000
Even if it's a little part something that's been an influence in your life

1497
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,000
When it's gone it's like

1498
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,000
Oh

1499
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,000
Oh you know it's that sort of

1500
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,000
Huh feeling

1501
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,000
Okay but with the infomercial guy that died today

1502
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,000
I'm not understanding that one

1503
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:55,000
Do people really truly miss him

1504
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,000
That aren't his friends and family

1505
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,000
Which I'm very sorry to hear about their loss

1506
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,000
It sounds like it was a sudden thing

1507
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:03,000
But it's a trending topic on Twitter

1508
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,000
Like really

1509
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,000
Was he really that influential

1510
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,000
Like maybe I'm missing something

1511
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,000
And I'm sorry I don't mean to offend

1512
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,000
Keep in mind he spawned

1513
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,000
A lot of funny

1514
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,000
He was one of those things

1515
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,000
Just like a 4chan funeral or something

1516
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,000
I would expect

1517
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,000
So I think it's just more like

1518
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,000
Oh that guy

1519
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:27,000
You know because you don't have

1520
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,000
Him to kick around anymore

1521
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,000
You know

1522
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,000
Especially though for all the celebrity deaths

1523
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,000
I was the saddest about Farrah Fawcett

1524
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,000
Not because of her fantastic hair

1525
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,000
And I think it's horrible though

1526
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,000
To die of anal cancer

1527
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,000
That's just

1528
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,000
A horrible thing

1529
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,000
If I try to watch her NBC special

1530
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,000
I can't watch it

1531
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,000
I get so choked up I feel like I'm gonna barf

1532
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,000
But you know what I think the worst thing was

1533
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,000
Is that she was gonna marry what's-his-name

1534
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,000
We are taking this video game talk show

1535
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,000
And really just getting way too deep tonight

1536
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:01,000
Which is supposed to be celebratory

1537
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:03,000
It's our fucking show

1538
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,000
Guess what

1539
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:07,000
There's no Santa Claus either

1540
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:09,000
And the Easter Bunny was made up by

1541
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,000
Pagans

1542
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,000
Bobby Blackwolf our old buddy here

1543
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,000
One thing to realize is that he was also on a reality show

1544
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,000
On Discovery about pitchmen

1545
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,000
And a lot of people watched that

1546
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,000
Because it showed more about the way he was outside

1547
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,000
Of screaming here's how to order

1548
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:27,000
So that's why I think more people got hit

1549
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:29,000
By Billy Mays than you would expect

1550
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:31,000
I watch pitchmen and all he does is scream

1551
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:33,000
On the show

1552
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,000
No really he doesn't

1553
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:37,000
It's weird

1554
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,000
No offense to Beth or anything

1555
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:41,000
But out of all the celebrity deaths

1556
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,000
Actually the Billy Mays one was the most surprising

1557
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,000
It's like holy crap

1558
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,000
What the hell

1559
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:49,000
There's somebody that's in perfectly good health

1560
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,000
But apparently

1561
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:53,000
The circumstances were all around

1562
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,000
Apparently he was on a plane

1563
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,000
That landed really

1564
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:59,000
I don't know

1565
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,000
Had a bad landing I guess

1566
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,000
And it caused part of the ceiling or whatever

1567
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,000
To hit him in the head and maybe

1568
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,000
Did some brain damage that way and he died in his sleep

1569
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,000
What

1570
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,000
It was an American Airlines flight

1571
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:13,000
So that's what's

1572
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:15,000
Going on there

1573
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,000
He died a few days later I guess

1574
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,000
That so doesn't sound

1575
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,000
Real

1576
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,000
We would be hearing so much more about

1577
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,000
This impending lawsuit and all this stuff

1578
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:27,000
I think there will be an impending lawsuit

1579
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,000
It sounds like it but

1580
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,000
The pitchmen show is kind of fun

1581
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:33,000
I like watching it

1582
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,000
I don't mean any disrespect

1583
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,000
It's just been such a weird week

1584
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,000
We've been celebrating death

1585
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,000
I shouldn't say celebrating

1586
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,000
But you know what I mean memorializing

1587
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,000
Trying to understand

1588
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:47,000
Who will be tomorrow? Which celebrity is going to die tomorrow?

1589
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,000
Life in the same week

1590
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,000
My birthday was this week

1591
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:53,000
I have because Beth only got 24

1592
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:55,000
And you know

1593
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:57,000
It just kind of goes to show

1594
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,000
And I know this sounds like such a hokey

1595
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,000
Dumb thing to say

1596
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:03,000
But it really is so true

1597
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:05,000
You've got to make the most out of the borrowed time you got

1598
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:07,000
You do if there's something

1599
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:09,000
That you've been wanting to do for a long time

1600
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:11,000
That you haven't done yet

1601
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:13,000
You need to just do it

1602
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,000
Stop making excuses and do it

1603
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:17,000
Because you may not be here tomorrow to do it then

1604
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:19,000
So seriously

1605
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:21,000
And I'm going to have to use instances like these

1606
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,000
To remind me to get off my butt

1607
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,000
And motivate myself

1608
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,000
Because I should be thankful I'm here to do them

1609
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,000
The other thing I want to say

1610
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,000
Is that obviously swine flu ain't a joke

1611
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,000
And I'm not saying you should run around

1612
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:35,000
Be crazy scared of it

1613
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,000
Wearing flu masks in public and all this stuff

1614
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,000
But what I am saying

1615
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,000
Boys, when you use the potty

1616
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,000
Wash your hands after you go

1617
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:45,000
Because I've watched people go in the men's room

1618
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:47,000
And then just go right out

1619
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,000
Perverts, I'm being serious for a minute here

1620
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,000
You know you've seen this too

1621
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,000
Maybe you've been a culprit

1622
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,000
Walk in the men's room, use the restroom

1623
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:57,000
Then walk right out without washing your hands

1624
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,000
That shit needs to stop

1625
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,000
We need to have a little more sanitary

1626
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,000
We might not be able to stop disease

1627
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,000
Completely

1628
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,000
We can sure slow it down

1629
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,000
And if anything this just goes to further

1630
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,000
Emphasize the point that Vegas is dirty

1631
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:15,000
Very dirty

1632
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,000
Well, I don't know

1633
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:19,000
We're not gonna know

1634
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:21,000
But here's the thing

1635
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,000
Wash your hands

1636
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:25,000
After the bathroom, in general

1637
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:27,000
After eating and all that stuff

1638
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:29,000
Keep hand sanitizer with you

1639
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:31,000
You don't have to be crazy germ obsessive

1640
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:33,000
I don't think we need to start a frenzy

1641
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,000
And I think that's sometimes what the media does

1642
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:37,000
But just be careful

1643
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,000
That's it

1644
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,000
Be careful and don't be lazy

1645
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,000
So there you go

1646
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:45,000
Anyhow

1647
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,000
That's, I guess, that for the deep topics

1648
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:49,000
Let's get back into video games for a minute, can we?

1649
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:51,000
I know, Loki, you've been awfully quiet

1650
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,000
This whole time. Surely you've got some game stories

1651
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:55,000
To take us away

1652
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,000
I just want to say, though, again, we don't have a script tonight

1653
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:59,000
So we're just gonna kind of wing it tonight with the game stories

1654
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:01,000
We'll talk about things

1655
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:03,000
We'll open up the Skype line a little bit if you guys want to call in as well

1656

1670
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,000
Oops, I almost gave the wrong chat room

1671
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:35,000
Chat.OrangeLoungeRadio.com

1672
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,000
There you go

1673
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:39,000
Actually, I was reading an article on The Consumerists

1674
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,000
By having an issue with his bacon of the month club

1675
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:43,000
I was just surprised that there was a bacon of the month club

1676
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:45,000
Of course it makes sense

1677
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,000
Because bacon is awesome

1678
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:49,000
And why not celebrate it once a month for 12 months

1679
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:51,000
But uh

1680
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,000
Yeah, it's interesting

1681
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:55,000
Apparently not a very good program though

1682
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:57,000
Better to buy your own bacon

1683
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:59,000
But anyways

1684
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:01,000
So yeah, stuff that's happened this week

1685
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:03,000
A whole lot of interesting things

1686
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,000
I guess I'll start things off with talking about

1687
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:07,000
Best Buy

1688
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:11,000
They're getting into the kiosk business I guess

1689
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,000
And they're actually installing

1690
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:15,000
They're testing it right now

1691
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,000
They're installing some kiosks into a few of their stores

1692
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,000
That are gonna do

1693
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:21,000
Use game trade-ins

1694
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:23,000
And also use movie trade-ins

1695
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:25,000
So you can actually trade in your games

1696
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:27,000
At these kiosks

1697
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:29,000
And then

1698
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:31,000
You basically get credit for whatever's in there

1699
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:33,000
And they give you the credit

1700
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,000
On a Best Buy card

1701
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:37,000
And you get to go spend that credit in the store

1702
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:39,000
Which I think is kind of a neat idea

1703
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,000
And hey, you know, I'm all about

1704
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:43,000
You know, getting

1705
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:45,000
Um

1706
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:47,000
You know, alternatives to like GameStop

1707
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:49,000
And you know the thing that's kind of pissed me off about GameStop lately

1708
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:51,000
Is when you do trades

1709
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:53,000
Before they used to go, okay

1710
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:55,000
You know, they scan a game, okay that was $18

1711
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:57,000
Okay, here's, this is $24

1712
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:59,000
And stuff like that

1713
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,000
Now it's just like, they have all your trades

1714
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:03,000
They've already put them behind the counter

1715
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:05,000
And they give you pretty much store credit

1716
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:07,000
It's like, well, you know, what if that was not satisfactory to me?

1717
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,000
What if, you know, they don't say

1718
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:11,000
Oh yeah, by the way, that one game was only worth 50 cents

1719
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:13,000
You know, that

1720
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,000
I don't like how they do that, it's kind of shady

1721
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:17,000
You know, every place else tells you what you're getting for each game

1722
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:19,000
That you trade in or movie or whatever

1723
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:21,000
Is that just maybe the particular GameStop you're going to?

1724
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:23,000
No, it's, they've all been doing it now

1725
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:25,000
So, I don't know, maybe it's just

1726
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:27,000
They don't care or whatever

1727
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:29,000
But they used to do that, so

1728
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:31,000
Now, what's kind of cool about this is

1729
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:33,000
Basically, it works like this

1730
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:35,000
You go to the kiosk

1731
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:37,000
You scan the barcodes of the games that you have

1732
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:39,000
On the machine

1733
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:41,000
And it will tell you how much

1734
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:43,000
It's going to give you for those games

1735
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:45,000
And you say, okay

1736
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:47,000
Whether to accept or deny that offer

1737
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:49,000
So if you accept it

1738
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:51,000
Then what you'll do is you'll pop the disc out

1739
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:53,000
You'll drop the case into almost like a drop box

1740
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:55,000
That they have there, like a mailbox

1741
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:57,000
And then the discs themselves

1742
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,000
Insert it into the machine

1743
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:01,000
And it will scan them to make sure

1744
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:03,000
That they're readable or don't have scratches on them

1745
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:05,000
Or verify

1746
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:07,000
I guess

1747
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:09,000
If it's an authentic game or whatever

1748
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:11,000
I don't know, the whole process

1749
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:13,000
To me doesn't seem like it would work

1750
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,000
Because

1751
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:17,000
You know, the read

1752
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:19,000
An Xbox 360 disc versus

1753
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:21,000
Reading a Wii disc is completely different

1754
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:23,000
And I mean, if you ever tried reading

1755
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,000
A Wii disc on your PC

1756
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:27,000
It doesn't work, it's because they read them differently

1757
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:29,000
They have a different file format

1758
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:31,000
So if it's actually physically scanning

1759
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:33,000
The surface of the disc, make sure there's no

1760
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:35,000
Scratches, I guess

1761
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:37,000
Maybe that's how it's working

1762
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:39,000
There's another one I think that they scanned

1763
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:41,000
Like a little barcode that's in the middle of the disc

1764
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:43,000
I'm not sure if that's how it's working

1765
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:45,000
But either way, to kind of get around the whole

1766
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:47,000
People just burning copies

1767
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,000
Or whatever, just faking

1768
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:51,000
Out the machine

1769
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:53,000
You actually do have to scan a credit card in there as well

1770
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:55,000
For verification purposes

1771
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,000
At the same time, it makes me wonder

1772
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:59,000
Huh, you know, I get these

1773
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:01,000
Pre-paid cards or whatever from

1774
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:03,000
My work every now and then for incentives

1775
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:05,000
And spiffs, and you can basically put

1776
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:07,000
Whatever information you want on those

1777
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:09,000
Like you literally go onto a website

1778
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:11,000
Log in, and you type in whatever

1779
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:13,000
Billing information, if I wanted to make myself look like

1780
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:15,000
Bob Barker or something like that, I could do that

1781
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:17,000
And there's really no way

1782
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:19,000
For the system to know, so

1783
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:21,000
Here's what I don't understand

1784
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:23,000
Why this whole elaborate

1785
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:25,000
Kiosk thing

1786
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:27,000
If this is the business Best Buy wants to get into

1787
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:29,000
I mean, it's not like the stores are always

1788
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:31,000
That freaking crowded and full of people

1789
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:33,000
They're trying to- Why can't the service associates

1790
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:35,000
Just scan the games and check them out

1791
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:37,000
The old fashioned way? I don't know

1792
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,000
Well, maybe it's because they're trying to get into more

1793
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:41,000
Of like a GameStop

1794
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:43,000
Type of business model

1795
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:45,000
But at the same time, they don't want to really

1796
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:47,000
I don't know

1797
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:49,000
Train people to do it? Yes

1798
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:51,000
Train people to do it, and also they're planning on

1799
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:53,000
Doing this later on for- Don't they have to train people

1800
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:55,000
To fix the machines? There's gonna have to be

1801
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:57,000
Somebody in the store that knows how to operate

1802
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:59,000
These machines all the time Not necessarily

1803
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:01,000
Just like, you know, the red box machines

1804
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:03,000
And stuff like that, they're in Walmarts and stuff

1805
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:05,000
They have an independent company that comes out there

1806
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:07,000
And services those machines

1807
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:09,000
And the same thing for these

1808
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:11,000
I have a feeling these are just branded

1809
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:13,000
E-Play machines

1810
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:15,000
Because E-Play is also

1811
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:17,000
Working with, I want to say

1812
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:19,000
Walmart as well

1813
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:21,000
They're gonna be doing the same type of thing

1814
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:23,000
Game trading it, and I bet you anything

1815
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:25,000
They can brand their machines so it'll look like

1816
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:27,000
Any sort of stuff

1817
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:29,000
Walmart's machines are just gonna say Walmart

1818
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:31,000
It's not gonna say E-Play

1819
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:33,000
But I bet you these are the same machines

1820
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:35,000
Because it sounds like the exact same thing that they're doing

1821
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:37,000
With Walmart

1822
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:39,000
I have so many games I should be trading back

1823
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:41,000
I haven't even sold back a game in like years

1824
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:43,000
No, probably been about a year

1825
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:45,000
Probably about a year and a half

1826
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:47,000
Was the last time I sold back a game

1827
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:49,000
What was the last one on the GameCube?

1828
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:51,000
I went and sold that one back finally

1829
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:53,000
Seven was the GameCube one, right?

1830
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:55,000
It was a couple Wii games

1831
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:57,000
Oh no, Full Auto on the 360

1832
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:59,000
I sold that back and the tennis game Top Spin I had

1833
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:01,000
You know, games I just wasn't playing at all

1834
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:03,000
But you know, you don't get that much for them

1835
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:05,000
I think the game I got more for than any other

1836
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:07,000
Was Mario Party

1837
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:09,000
But that's because they'd stopped making it

1838
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:11,000
And it was still in demand

1839
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:13,000
There's a few games that'll be coming in high demand

1840
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:15,000
And stuff like that

1841
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:17,000
But for stuff that I don't plan on playing

1842
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:19,000
Or I may have already picked up

1843
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:21,000
Or whatnot

1844
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:23,000
I try to trade it in as soon as I get it

1845
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:25,000
Because that's usually what it's worth the most

1846
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:27,000
And yeah, I know I can make a lot more money

1847
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:29,000
Selling it on eBay

1848
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:31,000
But to be honest, I just don't want to go through the hassle

1849
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:33,000
And for me, it doesn't really make a difference

1850
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:35,000
Because I'm not really losing out any money

1851
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:37,000
When you think about it

1852
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:39,000
Because I'm paying nothing to get the game

1853
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:41,000
And any money I make from it

1854
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:43,000
Is more money than I would have had anyways

1855
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:45,000
So, I don't know

1856
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:47,000
And a lot of times, you know, store credit and stuff

1857
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:49,000
Sits on my card forever

1858
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:51,000
You know, for a very long time before I actually use it for stuff

1859
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:53,000
Because honestly

1860
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:55,000
You know, with the situation that I have

1861
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:57,000
My Wii is modded, my Xbox 360 is modded

1862
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:59,000
The PS3 is the only thing that's not really modded

1863
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:01,000
My PSP is modded, my DS is modded

1864
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:03,000
I don't really have to buy games if I don't want to

1865
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:05,000
I mean, that's the thing

1866
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:07,000
I don't have to buy games

1867
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:09,000
Because I can get them through other means

1868
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:11,000
If I really want to play them

1869
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:13,000
But honestly, I have less time to play games now

1870
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:17,000
And, you know, I'm really not going to have time soon enough

1871
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:19,000
Yes, exactly

1872
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:21,000
So, you know, there's really

1873
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:23,000
I don't, you know, maybe that's not

1874
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:25,000
A great way to look at it

1875
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:27,000
Because I'm sure a lot of developers and stuff work hard

1876
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:29,000
And, you know, I'm putting out the games

1877
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:31,000
But you know what, it's one game

1878
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:33,000
And I mean, really

1879
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:35,000
I don't know

1880
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:37,000
I just don't care

1881
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:39,000
And I know that's probably a bad, you know, stance on that

1882
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:41,000
But I don't care

1883
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:43,000
I do find it interesting

1884
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:45,000
Everybody is trying to get into this business

1885
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:47,000
It's going to be interesting to see if GameStop

1886
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:49,000
Has to do something to

1887
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:51,000
And other game stores, you know, have to do something

1888
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:53,000
To kind of reinvigorate their business

1889
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:55,000
With all this competition

1890
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:57,000
Well, I could see them maybe putting an actual kiosk

1891
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:59,000
Out in front of their store or something like that

1892
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:01,000
You know, hey, look

1893
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:03,000
Now you can trade games, you know

1894
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:05,000
While we're closed

1895
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:07,000
Or, you know, the other thing that these machines

1896
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:09,000
Can do is allow you to rent

1897
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:11,000
Games as well

1898
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:13,000
Which, you know, they're testing that

1899
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:15,000
And I think that's a great idea

1900
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:17,000
You know, because, A, renting games

1901
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:19,000
You know, especially when you can stick these kiosks

1902
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:21,000
You know, like say in an apartment complex

1903
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:23,000
Or something like that

1904
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:25,000
That's kind of cool

1905
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:27,000
And you can also trade movies into this

1906
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:29,000
Which is also pretty cool because, you know what

1907
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:31,000
GameStop doesn't take movies back anymore

1908
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:33,000
They've stopped selling movies because it didn't work for them

1909
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:35,000
So that's something else

1910
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:37,000
So if you want to trade in

1911
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:39,000
Now you don't have to necessarily buy a game with it

1912
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:41,000
You can buy, you know, blank CD artists

1913
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:43,000
Or, you know, an iPod

1914
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:45,000
Or, you know, TV

1915
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:47,000
That's one thing I do like about it

1916
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:49,000
Is that, you know what, I could see myself using this money

1917
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:51,000
More effectively at Best Buy

1918
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:53,000
Just because there's more to pick from

1919
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:55,000
Or, and the other thing too

1920
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:57,000
You need a gift card for Best Buy

1921
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:59,000
And then you go up front where they have their gift card kiosks

1922
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:01,000
You know, with all these different gift cards

1923
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:03,000
For like, say, you know, Red Lobster

1924
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:05,000
Or something like that

1925
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:07,000
You trade in some DVDs or whatever

1926
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:09,000
And now you have dinner

1927
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:11,000
So it, I don't know

1928
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:13,000
There is benefits to it

1929
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:15,000
And same thing with Walmart

1930
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:17,000
Walmart's going to be doing the same type of thing

1931
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:19,000
Where you get in-store credit

1932
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:21,000
And hey, you know, some of these Super Walmarts

1933
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:23,000
There's your groceries

1934
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:25,000
So I don't see it as a bad thing

1935
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:27,000
And, you know, if anything I do like the fact that

1936
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:29,000
You know, you do have that choice

1937
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:31,000
Where you can buy stuff other than games

1938
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:33,000
Anyway, I want to just throw out there a special note

1939
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:35,000
For the folks that are listening live

1940
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:37,000
Apparently we've had a couple stream cut-outs tonight

1941
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:39,000
While we're taping, I don't know what's going on with that

1942
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:41,000
I just watched one happen

1943
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:43,000
We did get booted on our end and we had to reconnect to the feed

1944
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:45,000
I don't know if we're having

1945
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:47,000
Bandwidth problems in studio

1946
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:49,000
Or if that's something on the shoutcast end

1947
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:51,000
I turned off my torrents

1948
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:53,000
I don't know, it could just be a fluke

1949
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:55,000
But there's nothing we can do here in studio

1950
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:57,000
So we'll just keep doing our thing

1951
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:59,000
Do the show best we can

1952
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:01,000
But as far as we know, it is not on our end

1953
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:03,000
Alright, so let's

1954
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:05,000
I guess move on with some more news

1955
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:07,000
If we can

1956
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:09,000
Darcy, I know you had some things you wanted to talk about tonight

1957
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:11,000
So let's make sure we get that taken care of

1958
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:13,000
Well this is just a bit of interest

1959
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:15,000
I know that there's people who are fans of the

1960
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:17,000
Serious Sam series

1961
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:19,000
So there's actually a PC version of

1962
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:21,000
Serious Sam HD

1963
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:23,000
That came out for Xbox Live Arcade

1964
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:25,000
It will be released digitally

1965
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:27,000
And also in shops

1966
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:29,000
And the console version

1967
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:31,000
However is not going to be out this summer

1968
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:33,000
So it's going to be there

1969
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:35,000
When it's there

1970
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:37,000
So that's pretty good

1971
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:39,000
Serious Sam is serious

1972
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:41,000
I don't know, it looks kind of cool

1973
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:43,000
Kind of like an old school

1974
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:45,000
Duke Nukem type of game

1975
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:47,000
That they're actually doing something to it

1976
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:49,000
Other than just, let's put it back out

1977
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:51,000
Or, hey, well Duke Nukem

1978
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:53,000
I guess, Duke Nukem 3D did

1979
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:55,000
Like that rewind thing

1980
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:57,000
Which was neat

1981
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:59,000
And then I stopped playing the game

1982
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:01,000
That's the problem

1983
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:03,000
They need a new Duke Nukem game

1984
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:05,000
For like, Xbox Live

1985
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:07,000
That'd be cool

1986
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:09,000
Rumor is there might be another one in development

1987
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:11,000
That was Duke Zero or something

1988
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:13,000
Did you read that this week?

1989
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:15,000
Yes I did

1990
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:17,000
And my first thought was

1991
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:19,000
Stop ripping off subtitles for Batman

1992
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:21,000
Because seriously it was

1993
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:23,000
Duke Nukem Forever

1994
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:25,000
And then Duke begins

1995
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:27,000
I'm like stop!

1996
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:29,000
And then Duke and Robin, who knew

1997
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:31,000
Exactly

1998
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:33,000
Speaking of Xbox Live, can I say this real quick

1999
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:35,000
I'm sorry DarkSakura, but you would appreciate this

2000
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:37,000
Have you ever played Garou Mark of the Wolves

2001
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:39,000
The game that came out on Xbox Live this week

2002
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:41,000
I know you may not have played it on Xbox Live

2003
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:43,000
Have you played it in the past?

2004
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:45,000
Yeah I think I have the PS2 version

2005
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:47,000
No I have the Dreamcast one

2006
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:49,000
But you realize that some of the characters

2007
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:51,000
In this game have some really funny names

2008
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:53,000
Like who?

2009
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:55,000
There are some characters

2010
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:57,000
Like Kim Kap Wan apparently had kids

2011
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:59,000
And one of them is named Dong

2012
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:01,000
And that's one of the characters you can play

2013
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:03,000
But then there's another character in the game

2014
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:05,000
And the name of the character is

2015
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:07,000
I'm looking for it here

2016
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:09,000
Kushunud Butt

2017
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:11,000
So you can literally play

2018
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:13,000
In this game

2019
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:15,000
Butt vs. Dong

2020
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:17,000
Or Dong vs. Butt if you will

2021
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:19,000
And I know this is so junior high

2022
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:21,000
For me to say

2023
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:23,000
But what kind of surprised me about this whole thing

2024
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:25,000
The Butt vs. Dong

2025
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:27,000
Is that we still have

2026
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:29,000
This whole controversy going on about

2027
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:31,000
What can and can't be in your profiles

2028
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:33,000
I almost want to put

2029
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:35,000
In my profile Butt vs. Dong

2030
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:37,000
Just to see if I get

2031
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:39,000
You know

2032
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:41,000
A temp ban or something and say what

2033
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:43,000
I was just referencing an epic

2034
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:45,000
Mark of the Wolves fight I had online

2035
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:47,000
Lord

2036
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:49,000
Just saying

2037
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:51,000
If you don't believe me

2038
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:53,000
Go look

2039
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:55,000
I am not making this

2040
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:57,000
Crap

2041
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:59,000
I know

2042
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:01,000
I saw it in Rob D's Live Journal

2043
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:03,000
He had a screenshot of it

2044
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:05,000
I'll give credit where credit is due

2045
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:07,000
And I just started laughing and I didn't believe it

2046
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:09,000
I thought it was a photoshop thing

2047
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:11,000
Like he was trying to make a joke I didn't get

2048
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:13,000
So I looked it up on Wikipedia like the characters

2049
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:15,000
As much as I love Fatal Fury

2050
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:17,000
I went and looked it up on Wikipedia and sure enough

2051
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:19,000
There's a character named Butt and a character named Dong

2052
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:21,000
You need to come over

2053
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:23,000
Well you know what after your dinner

2054
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:25,000
Let's look up the Dreamcast

2055
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:27,000
And get our Garou on

2056
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:29,000
My boyfriend will be so bored

2057
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:31,000
If he's here

2058
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:33,000
He's not much of a gamer we'll see

2059
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:35,000
Why don't we watch a movie

2060
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:37,000
Movie he can do

2061
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:39,000
We'll watch movies

2062
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:41,000
On your sexy blu-ray

2063
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:43,000
God my TV is sexy

2064
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:45,000
Sorry more gaming news

2065
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:47,000
Well I actually do have one other little thing

2066
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:49,000
Sure

2067
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:51,000
You know how we like to make fun of video game movies

2068
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:53,000
You know I just was talking about Silent Hill

2069
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:55,000
I love that movie

2070
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:57,000
They're doing an Uncharted movie

2071
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:59,000
It's actually being scripted

2072
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:01,000
By Kyle Ward who already did

2073
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:03,000
Kane and Lynch

2074
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:05,000
Bruce Willis is starring in that

2075
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:07,000
Pretty cool

2076
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:09,000
I like Bruce Willis

2077
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:11,000
Because he's aged better than Harrison Ford

2078
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:13,000
Except for Hudson Hawk

2079
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:15,000
No

2080
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:17,000
Moving forward

2081
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:19,000
But

2082
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:21,000
It's also

2083
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:23,000
Being produced by

2084
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:25,000
Some former

2085
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:27,000
Marvel people

2086
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:29,000
Avi and Ari Arad

2087
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:31,000
Who are also producing

2088
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:33,000
The Lost Planet

2089
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:35,000
They were actually

2090
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:37,000
Going to adapt Lost Planet

2091
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:39,000
To a film

2092
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:41,000
So hey

2093
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:43,000
That might be neat

2094
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:45,000
If they do it right

2095
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:47,000
The whole thing

2096
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:49,000
With this video game to movie

2097
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:51,000
Adaptation

2098
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:53,000
It has to be done right

2099
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:55,000
You know

2100
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:57,000
We can't have

2101
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:59,000
We can't have another

2102
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:01,000
Repeat of

2103
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:03,000
Super Mario Brothers

2104
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:05,000
Oh lord

2105
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:07,000
That's a movie I've never watched

2106
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:09,000
I've seen a few minutes

2107
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:11,000
I've seen like a few minutes

2108
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:13,000
Of the end

2109
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:15,000
I've heard it has funny scenes

2110
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:17,000
I thought that movie was alright

2111
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:19,000
I've never seen it in theaters

2112
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:21,000
And you know what

2113
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:23,000
So what if the Super Mario Brothers movie

2114
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:25,000
Was crap

2115
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:27,000
What the hell are you going to do

2116
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:29,000
Plot wise with Super Mario Brothers

2117
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:31,000
I mean seriously

2118
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:33,000
There's nothing that they could have possibly done

2119
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:35,000
That would have made any sense

2120
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:37,000
At all

2121
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:39,000
And you know

2122
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:41,000
Props for them trying to come up with an original idea

2123
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:43,000
To be honest

2124
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:45,000
So it was kind of a rip off

2125
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:47,000
Of Judge Dredd in a little bit

2126
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:49,000
If you look at futuristic

2127
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:51,000
City and stuff like that

2128
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:53,000
But hey there's references to everything in there

2129
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:55,000
And you know

2130
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:57,000
At least they tried

2131
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:59,000
What is up with your icons?

2132
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:01,000
You know what the default

2133
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:03,000
The default icons on our site come from

2134
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:05,000
That's the default? Oh that's the WordPress one

2135
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:07,000
It's a user generated

2136
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:09,000
Site

2137
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:11,000
I'm never getting rid of my Deadpool

2138
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:13,000
Anyhow was that it for your stories today?

2139
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:15,000
Well not for my stories

2140
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:17,000
But that's all I'm going to talk about for now

2141
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:19,000
Well then we'll come back to you later on in part B

2142
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:21,000
Why don't we?

2143
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:23,000
Alright cause we're going to take a break soon

2144
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:25,000
But I want to get a few more stories out

2145
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:27,000
I know Loki's got a bunch he wants to get through

2146
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:29,000
I'll let him get one more

2147
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:31,000
But let me just give you a couple quick ones here

2148
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:33,000
Because some celebrity deaths

2149
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:35,000
Are crazy around Hollywood

2150
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:37,000
You know if I were in Hollywood right now and on prescription medications

2151
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:39,000
I would be so worried

2152
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:41,000
For what it's worth

2153
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:43,000
But hey Michael Jackson if you want to

2154
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:45,000
Have something to remember Michael Jackson

2155
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:47,000
By of course we were talking about how art lives on forever

2156
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:49,000
His Thriller video is actually free

2157
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:51,000
Right now

2158
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:53,000
Or did it just end?

2159
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:55,000
I didn't get on and get the video

2160
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:57,000
It is an epic music video

2161
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:59,000
Like I wasn't sitting in my living room

2162
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:01,000
I was in second grade watching it when it aired

2163
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:03,000
When did it end? Wasn't it just today?

2164
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:05,000
It was today I guess

2165
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:07,000
Today's not over?

2166
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:09,000
Well it's 200 Microsoft points now so

2167
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:11,000
Well it was free

2168
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:13,000
Sorry if you didn't get your hands on it

2169
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:15,000
You know I actually do remember when that aired

2170
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:17,000
I do too MTV used to air the whole darn thing

2171
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:19,000
Well there was a special thing they were doing

2172
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:21,000
It was supposed to air at midnight

2173
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:23,000
And my mom

2174
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:25,000
I was in second grade

2175
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:27,000
And my mom let me stay up to watch it

2176
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:29,000
When it aired at midnight

2177
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:31,000
I kind of agree with

2178
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:33,000
Frisbee and chat, chat.artisanshredder.com

2179
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:35,000
Just go to YouTube and watch it

2180
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:37,000
If you need to see the Thriller video

2181
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:39,000
Fire up your Playstation 3

2182
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:41,000
And go to the web browser and pull up Thriller on YouTube

2183
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:43,000
There you go, free

2184
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:45,000
In fact lots of Michael Jackson videos

2185
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:47,000
Available for free

2186
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:49,000
Thanks to the wonders of YouTube

2187
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:51,000
Thank you Frisbee

2188
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:53,000
Appreciate it

2189
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:55,000
Hey some other stories going on out there right now

2190
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:57,000
Apparently there is some new developments

2191
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:59,000
On games coming to Playstation Network

2192
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:01,000
At least in Japan

2193
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:03,000
Final Fantasy and Mega Man

2194
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:05,000
And I am talking the old school Final Fantasy game

2195
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:07,000
That's right Final Fantasy 1

2196
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:09,000
So I know this is weird because

2197
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:11,000
Final Fantasy 1 was on the NES

2198
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:13,000
But here's the thing, this is apparently

2199
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:15,000
The Playstation re-release

2200
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:17,000
Or whatever

2201
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:19,000
Which was the original but with some minor tweaks

2202
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:21,000
It was the one that, it's sort of like what they put out on the PSP

2203
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:23,000
But not what they put out on the PSP

2204
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:25,000
I want to clarify that

2205
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:27,000
Because the one they put out on the PSP was like really

2206
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:29,000
It was almost high def and stuff

2207
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:31,000
It was really fancy

2208
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:33,000
They added some dungeons and stuff like that

2209
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:35,000
In the PS1 version or whatever

2210
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:37,000
But I don't know

2211
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:39,000
Well now here's the thing

2212
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:41,000
Mega Man 9 actually

2213
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:43,000
Came out in Japan way later than we got it

2214
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:45,000
I don't know how that happened but they did

2215
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:47,000
They got the game a lot later than we did

2216
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:49,000
They just got it and apparently

2217
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:51,000
There is some type of competition going on

2218
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:53,000
In Japan right now

2219
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:55,000
If you enter this competition you get

2220
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:57,000
Rockman because that's what they call Mega Man over there

2221
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:59,000
Rockman Complete Works

2222
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:01,000
It's Mega Man 1 through 6 which I think was some type of

2223
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:03,000
Playstation compilation they had

2224
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:05,000
Before the one they had here on

2225
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:07,000
Playstation 2 and GameCube

2226
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:09,000
Because that's when they added in 7 and 8

2227
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:11,000
So yeah they have 1 through 6

2228
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:13,000
Available on a Playstation 1 disc

2229
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:15,000
But it's now on Playstation Network over in Japan

2230
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:17,000
So hopefully keep your fingers and toes crossed

2231
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:19,000
Maybe these games will come out over here

2232
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:21,000
At least that's what people are hoping

2233
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:23,000
My thought? Don't bet on it

2234
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:25,000
I don't think either of these games are going to come out in the west

2235
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:27,000
You want to know why? I don't think they're going to go back and bother

2236
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:29,000
To re-translate them. Why would they? They didn't before

2237
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:31,000
Do you think somebody is really going to go in

2238
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:33,000
And translate Final Fantasy 1

2239
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:35,000
Just to release on Playstation Network?

2240
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:37,000
Fat chance

2241
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:39,000
Didn't they have that over here?

2242
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:41,000
There was something that was a Final Fantasy collection

2243
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:43,000
It was a few games

2244
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:45,000
On the PSP they have Final Fantasy 1 and 2

2245
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:47,000
No they actually had one on the Playstation

2246
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:49,000
They had the one that was 5 and 6

2247
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:51,000
And then they had the 4 and Chrono Trigger

2248
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:53,000
So maybe those will show up

2249
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:55,000
On Playstation Network

2250
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:57,000
That's certainly a possibility

2251
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:59,000
I think it would be actually kind of rad to see

2252
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:01,000
The 5 and 6 compilation show up

2253
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:03,000
Final Fantasy 6

2254
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:05,000
Not a Final Fantasy game that's been visited in a little while

2255
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:07,000
And it's one of the greatest if not the greatest Final Fantasy game

2256
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:09,000
Period

2257
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:11,000
So 4 is getting a lot of attention again thanks to the after years

2258
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:13,000
But 6

2259
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:15,000
Oh my god if they didn't after years for 6

2260
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:17,000
I'd be all over that

2261
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:19,000
Don't even tell me

2262
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:21,000
I'm still all over 5 by the way

2263
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:23,000
I still think 5 is the best of them

2264
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:27,000
Let's see

2265
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:29,000
GameGuru says Mega Man Anniversary Edition actually used

2266
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:31,000
The Rockman Complete Works versions

2267
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:33,000
Of the NES games so they've been translated

2268
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:35,000
Interesting

2269
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:37,000
They still won't go back yet

2270
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:39,000
You know what if they did

2271
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:41,000
It would be a pleasant surprise

2272
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:43,000
But at the same time I do own the compilation

2273
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:45,000
On GameCube already

2274
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:47,000
I don't really need it

2275
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:49,000
Well hey you know what maybe they'll move to

2276
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:51,000
Since they're going to be doing the digital download

2277
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:53,000
Stuff now

2278
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:55,000
Maybe they're going to try to move more towards

2279
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:57,000
If they do a Playstation 2 emulation

2280
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:59,000
Or something like that

2281
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:01,000
The full Playstation 2 game downloads

2282
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:03,000
Just like they have with the PS3

2283
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:05,000
At least with Burnout

2284
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:07,000
Maybe we'll see that when that happens

2285
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:09,000
I know there's a lot of Mega Man and Final Fantasy

2286
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:11,000
Fans that would love to see these come out

2287
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:13,000
On Playstation Network

2288
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:15,000
I would say maybe Final Fantasy 1

2289
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:17,000
For PSP will be on the

2290
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:19,000
Download because all the PSP games are shifting

2291
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:21,000
To download only I think that's inevitable

2292
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:23,000
At some point

2293
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:25,000
I don't know about these exact games

2294
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:27,000
By the way though I will say this though

2295
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:29,000
Final Fantasy 1 that Playstation remake is only $6

2296
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:31,000
That's not bad at all

2297
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:33,000
But I'm telling you I don't know how this one was

2298
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:35,000
On the Playstation but if they didn't update

2299
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:37,000
The battle system to the more active

2300
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:39,000
Time battle that they featured in the PSP

2301
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:41,000
Remake the more Final Fantasy 4 style battle

2302
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:43,000
I can't like it's so

2303
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:45,000
Hard to go from what you're used

2304
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:47,000
To back to old

2305
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:49,000
School Final Fantasy battle which was

2306
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:51,000
Like if you attack the monster and the

2307
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:53,000
Monster dies mid round then

2308
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:55,000
You lose your attack gets mixing a lot

2309
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:57,000
Harder back there and

2310
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:59,000
The whole thing and the magic not being based

2311
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:01,000
Off of MP but a whole different system

2312
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:03,000
So what if they

2313
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:05,000
When I have to tell you what popped into my

2314
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:07,000
Head though when you mentioned Final Fantasy

2315
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:09,000
And Mega Man it's like

2316
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:11,000
Mega Man in Final Fantasy

2317
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:13,000
Hey that'd be kind of cool

2318
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:15,000
So

2319
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:17,000
Game grew also

2320
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:19,000
As for Final Fantasy is it the Playstation 1

2321
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:21,000
Version because Final Fantasy Origins came

2322
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:23,000
Over here no I know that but I'm talking Final Fantasy

2323
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:25,000
1 not the

2324
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:27,000
It wasn't Origins the 5-6 combo

2325
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:29,000
4-5

2326
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:31,000
No 4 and Trigger was another

2327
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:33,000
thing they called like Final Fantasy

2328
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:35,000
Chronicles I want to say

2329
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:37,000
Forgive me if my memory

2330
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:39,000
Is fading it's been many years since that came out

2331
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:41,000
But there was yeah

2332
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:43,000
Well there was a time though that I would have hopped all

2333
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:45,000
Over this but I had

2334
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:47,000
The

2335
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:49,000
I actually bought a wonder swan color

2336
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:51,000
So I could play Final Fantasy

2337
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:53,000
Still no word on Mystic Quest

2338
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:55,000
Who cares

2339
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:57,000
Loki

2340
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:59,000
You got anything else for us maybe one more story

2341
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:01,000
Before we go to a break tonight? Yeah sure why not

2342
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:03,000
Well apparently

2343
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:05,000
There's some more details coming out

2344
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:07,000
About No More Heroes 2 and this is

2345
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:09,000
Coming from Nintendo Power

2346
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:11,000
And there's

2347
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:13,000
I guess 3 different plot details

2348
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:15,000
That I guess can be considered spoilers

2349
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:17,000
But apparently

2350
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:19,000
Shinobu the teen

2351
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:21,000
Assassin from the original game will be returning

2352
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:23,000
In this sequel

2353
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:25,000
As a playable character her

2354
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:27,000
Fighting style I guess will be different

2355
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:29,000
Than Travis' and

2356
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:31,000
She'll move faster it can even jump

2357
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:33,000
And I guess you can play her whenever you want

2358
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:35,000
They're expecting

2359
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:37,000
That there's going to be 50 boss battles

2360
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:39,000
And you'll also be able to play the bosses

2361
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:41,000
With either character

2362
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:43,000
And just to mix things up

2363
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:45,000
And there'll be different cutscenes

2364
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:47,000
And stuff like that for that

2365
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:49,000
And then finally it says the primary reason that

2366
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:51,000
Travis is taking on the United

2367
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:53,000
Assassins Association again is to

2368
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:55,000
Avenge the death of his best friend from the first game

2369
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:57,000
Bishop

2370
01:14:57,000 --> 01:14:59,000
And unfortunately I didn't play through the first game enough

2371
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:01,000
To probably get to any of those

2372
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:03,000
Plot points but

2373
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:05,000
I am kind of

2374
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:07,000
I want to check out the sequel though

2375
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:09,000
And probably go back to the first one at some point

2376
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:11,000
Once again you know that would

2377
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:13,000
Probably require me to

2378
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:15,000
Somehow slow down time

2379
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:17,000
Which I don't think I can

2380
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:19,000
Need more hours in the day

2381
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:23,000
Let's go ahead and do one more

2382
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:25,000
I see you have a whole lot of stories there

2383
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:27,000
We're going to have so much stuff for Part B

2384
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:29,000
Let's do one more

2385
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:31,000
Australia has decided to

2386
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:33,000
Block online access to games

2387
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:35,000
With content beyond the rating

2388
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:37,000
MA-15

2389
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:39,000
Apparently this will

2390
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:41,000
Apply to

2391
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:43,000
I guess

2392
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:45,000
Console games

2393
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:47,000
Also famous MMORPGs

2394
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:49,000
Such as Second Life and World of Warcraft

2395
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:51,000
Very well may be affected by

2396
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:53,000
This new censorship policy

2397
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:55,000
Wait a minute I thought I heard something about this a while ago

2398
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:57,000
They were talking about that World of Warcraft would not be playable

2399
01:15:57,000 --> 01:15:59,000
In Australia or something

2400
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:01,000
Is this like a further development or something?

2401
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:03,000
Maybe I'm crazy

2402
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:05,000
I thought I heard something like this before

2403
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:07,000
Sorry man I don't mean to like

2404
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:09,000
Move in on the story

2405
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:11,000
This sounds like we've heard something like this before

2406
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:13,000
I remember

2407
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:15,000
They will be

2408
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:17,000
Very well may be affected

2409
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:19,000
By this new censorship policy

2410
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:21,000
If it pushes through

2411
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:23,000
That online games exemption on

2412
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:25,000
Content ratings is the only reason

2413
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:27,000
Why multiplayer games with

2414
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:29,000
User generated environments are possibly in

2415
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:31,000
This country

2416
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:33,000
Without it it would take

2417
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:35,000
One game user anywhere in the world to

2418
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:37,000
Produce objectionable content

2419
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:39,000
And the game environment to make

2420
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:41,000
The Australian government ban the game for everyone

2421
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:43,000
They're just saying

2422
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:45,000
Someone's going to ruin it

2423
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:47,000
But yeah

2424
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:49,000
Apparently I guess

2425
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:51,000
Second Life will probably be

2426
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:53,000
Part of that since

2427
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:55,000
Second Life is pretty objectionable as it is

2428
01:16:57,000 --> 01:16:59,000
Interesting

2429
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:01,000
Why did they want to ban it? Just because they can't control it?

2430
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:03,000
They can't release it?

2431
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:05,000
Second Life is about to be locked

2432
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:07,000
It says

2433
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:09,000
It will be barred under

2434
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:11,000
The mystery sinister filtering plan

2435
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:13,000
This is going back to

2436
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:15,000
The whole MA-15 thing

2437
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:17,000
Because there is adult content

2438
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:19,000
In Second Life

2439
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:21,000
There's two sexy things

2440
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:23,000
As Destructoid puts it

2441
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:25,000
There's adult things everywhere

2442
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:27,000
That looks pretty adult to me

2443
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:29,000
I don't know

2444
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:31,000
Well hey before we go to break tonight

2445
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:33,000
We have a couple things we want to get through

2446
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:35,000
We got to get to the classic game of the week

2447
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:37,000
But I also want to get some voicemails out of the way

2448
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:39,000
Because it's been forever since we played some voicemails

2449
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:41,000
Here on the show

2450
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:43,000
And I know we had a few on the line tonight

2451
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:45,000
That we wanted to play

2452
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:47,000
And I got to bring up the voicemails here

2453
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:49,000
First off

2454
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:51,000
Well just listen

2455
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:53,000
Just listen to these voicemails that were left on the line

2456
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:55,000
These are actual phone calls to our Skype line

2457
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:57,000
When we're not here

2458
01:17:57,000 --> 01:17:59,000
You can call at any time 877-GAME-OLR

2459
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:01,000
And leave us a message

2460
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:03,000
Yes hello

2461
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:05,000
Is this Mr. Roberts?

2462
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:07,000
Yes hi

2463
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:09,000
This is the Pure Dildo Factory

2464
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:11,000
In Washington D.C.

2465
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:13,000
In New York

2466
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:15,000
We're calling in regards to your order

2467
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:17,000
For two dozen big black floppy dildos

2468
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:19,000
We're having difficulty delivering

2469
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:21,000
Your personal batch of two dozen

2470
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:23,000
Black floppy dildos

2471
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:25,000
God dammit

2472
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:27,000
What?

2473
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:29,000
Happy birthday Rob!

2474
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:31,000
Happy birthday Rob!

2475
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:33,000
Happy birthday Rob!

2476

From all of us here at USO

I do not condone Travis

2478
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:39,000
And his dildo selling

2479
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:41,000
That's a matter of you two

2480
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:43,000
But happy birthday

2481
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:45,000
No no no

2482
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:47,000
Rob we know

2483
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:49,000
You're missing your monthly shipment

2484
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:51,000
Of big black dildos

2485
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:53,000
We know you like big floppy black dildos

Because we know you like putting big floppy

2487

Black dildos in your butt

2488
01:18:57,000 --> 01:18:59,000
So what?

2489
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:01,000
Absolutely we know you just love having to do that

01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:03,000

Happy birthday and

Sunday nights here on All Games Radio for leaving us

That I'm sorry but I find that highly offensive you guys

2500

01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:25,000
I'm just like really offended that you would

01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:27,000
Go and like joke about that kind of stuff

Like 12? Besides everybody should know

2507

It's big hard

2508
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:39,000
Black dildos not big floppy

2509
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:41,000
Black dildos please

01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:43,000
Don't waste my time

01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:45,000
Hey let's go to the next voice mail

So y'all better be fucking prepared

I'll go ahead and let you go

2526

I gotta get ready for fucking work soon

2527

Bye

01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:21,000
Well sorry to hear about your fucking work but uh

2529
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:23,000
Yeah that's a little teaser

2530
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:25,000

01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:01,000
Zombie Be Gone the only way to take care of zombies

2549
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:03,000
Like me and keep Michael Jackson's

2550
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:05,000
Skin white with OxiClean

2551
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:07,000
Act Now

2552
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:09,000
Goodbye

2553
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:11,000
Yeah

2554
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:13,000
I guess this is how

2555
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:15,000
Some of us cope with bad news

2556
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:17,000
Alright if you want to leave us a voice mail

2557
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:19,000
1-877-GAME-OL-R

2558
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:21,000
Oh

2559
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:23,000
Travis still up to your old

2560
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:25,000
Shenanigans after all these years

2561
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:29,000
Anyway

2562
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:31,000
Let's get to the classic game of the week shall we

2563
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:33,000
Dark Sakura always likes to take a trip through the archives

2564
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:35,000
And pick a game that you kids

2565
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:37,000
Should be checking out and playing every week

2566
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:39,000
Well you can

2567
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:41,000
Play the game every week if you want

2568
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:43,000
But she also gives you a new game each week that you can play

2569
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:45,000
So here it is

2570
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:47,000
Dark Sakura's classic game of the week

2571
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:53,000
So Dark Sakura

2572
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:55,000
What game should the kids be playing

2573
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:57,000
This week?

2574
01:21:57,000 --> 01:21:59,000
They should be playing Dragon Force on the Sega Saturn

2575
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:01,000
Wait like Dragon Force from Guitar Hero?

2576
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:03,000
No

2577
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:05,000
Boo

2578
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:07,000
Let me pull up the audio here real quick

2579
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:09,000
In the studio

2580
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:11,000
Tell us a little bit about Dragon Force

2581
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:13,000
What this game is all about

2582
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:15,000
Dragon Force is a

2583
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:17,000
Combination real time and turn based strategy

2584
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:19,000
Game

2585
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:21,000
It was actually released in America

2586
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:23,000
As a working design

2587
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:25,000
Translation

2588
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:27,000
We never did get the sequel over here however

2589
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:29,000
The sequel was pretty freaking good

2590
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:31,000
But basically

2591
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:33,000
You play as

2592
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:35,000
One of this continents eight rulers

2593
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:37,000
And

2594
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:39,000
Each ruler of course has a different goal

2595
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:41,000
One wants to rule the whole thing

2596
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:43,000
Someone wants to unite everyone

2597
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:45,000
People want to destroy it

2598
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:47,000
And so you move along these paths

2599
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:49,000
From towns to castles

2600
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:51,000
And you want to capture the castles

2601
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:53,000
And then you face off in battle

2602
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:55,000
So you have your

2603
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:57,000
Strategy tactics

2604
01:22:57,000 --> 01:22:59,000
Where you're moving around

2605
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:01,000
From

2606
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:03,000
Town to town across your map

2607
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:05,000
But then when you

2608
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:07,000
Get to towns and castles you have your

2609
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:09,000
Battle and you play as the general

2610
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:11,000
Commanding their troops

2611
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:13,000
And so once you

2612
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:15,000
Get to that part you're

2613
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:17,000
Commanding these epic battles

2614
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:19,000
And it's you know you have a

2615
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:21,000
Also an

2616
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:23,000
End game week where you do

2617
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:25,000
Administrative stuff where you tend to your troops

2618
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:27,000
You know you can increase the number of your troops

2619
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:29,000
You can pay them more

2620
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:31,000
You can capture

2621
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:33,000
Enemy generals

2622
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:35,000
Join your army, fortify castles that type of stuff

2623
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:37,000
But the big thing

2624
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:39,000
Is really the epic battles

2625
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:41,000
And

2626
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:43,000
This is probably

2627
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:45,000
One of the greatest video games

2628
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:47,000
Of all time in fact

2629
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:49,000
It won EGM's game of the month award

2630
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:51,000
In 1986

2631
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:53,000
If you skip

2632
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:55,000
Just a little bit

2633
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:57,000
On that video you can get to the battle

2634
01:23:57,000 --> 01:23:59,000
There you go

2635
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:01,000
You get to see

2636
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:03,000
Your big armies and I've actually

2637
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:05,000
There's battles of larger armies than that

2638
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:11,000
This game looks different

2639
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:13,000
It actually is really a lot of fun

2640
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:15,000
In fact

2641
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:17,000
It's like you really

2642
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:19,000
To make this work for radio

2643
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:21,000
That you kind of watch them like

2644
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:23,000
There's these big armies

2645
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:25,000
And they're kind of throwing fireballs

2646
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:27,000
And things like across this field

2647
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:29,000
And you watch the TV kind of scroll through this field

2648
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:31,000
Until it gets to the other army

2649
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:33,000
It's kind of interesting

2650
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:35,000
It's like a side scrolling RTS game

2651
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:37,000
The battles are

2652
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:39,000
Term based like that

2653
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:41,000
So you basically

2654
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:43,000
As you can see in that part now they're actually doing melee

2655
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:45,000
You know your goal is to

2656
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:47,000
Capture or kill the other general

2657
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:49,000
And so

2658
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:51,000
Each general can attack each other

2659
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:53,000
They've got their special abilities

2660
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:55,000
But you can also send your troops to

2661
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:57,000
Overrun the other too

2662
01:24:57,000 --> 01:24:59,000
You know so whether or not you want to leave yourself

2663
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:01,000
Defended or whether or not you want to take over

2664
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:03,000
The other general

2665
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:05,000
It's pretty neat

2666
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:07,000
It's like you're commanding your own army

2667
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:09,000
Actually I think they based

2668
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:11,000
Did they base Advance Wars sort of off this?

2669
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:13,000
I think a little bit

2670
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:15,000
But this definitely

2671
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:17,000
Kind of thing

2672
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:19,000
It's epic

2673
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:21,000
This game is an epic game

2674
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:23,000
Just like Dragon Force the band

2675
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:25,000
Which who knows maybe that's where they got their name

2676
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:27,000
You never know

2677
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:29,000
Could be but um

2678
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:31,000
Actually go ahead and link that in the chat room

2679
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:33,000
Let people take a look at it

2680
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:35,000
Because really it's something you have to see before you play

2681
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:37,000
For those of you listening on the podcast

2682
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:39,000
You can always search for this on YouTube

2683
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:41,000
Dragon Force is two words

2684
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:43,000
Just look for Dragon Force Sega Saturn

2685
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:45,000
Version is very

2686
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:47,000
Very hard to find

2687
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:49,000
Very hard to get

2688
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:51,000
It's a working designs title

2689
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:53,000
Good luck

2690
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:55,000
They did do a release for it

2691
01:25:55,000 --> 01:25:57,000
As part of the Sega Ages

2692
01:25:57,000 --> 01:25:59,000
PS2 collection

2693
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:01,000
But that version isn't Japanese

2694
01:26:01,000 --> 01:26:03,000
I like that the

2695
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:05,000
Troops rally

2696
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:07,000
They yell and run into battle

2697
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:09,000
That's pretty hardcore

2698
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:11,000
You got your troops falling in battle

2699
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:13,000
Doing their best to defend their generals

2700
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:15,000
So it's pretty

2701
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:17,000
Pretty cool

2702
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:19,000
So a RTS RPG

2703
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:21,000
Action-y kind of game

2704
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:23,000
It's so hard to describe otherwise

2705
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:25,000
It's very hard to find here in America

2706
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:27,000
But good luck

2707
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:29,000
Maybe you'll find something

2708
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:31,000
Out there that's playable

2709
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:33,000
Well in Japan it was published by Sega

2710
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:35,000
But it's a working designs

2711
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:37,000
Release over here

2712
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:39,000
Dragon Force is the classic game of the week

2713
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:41,000
Yes

2714
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:43,000
And I believe that's all there is to say on that

2715
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:45,000
So

2716
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:47,000
That's going to do it for part A tonight of Orange Lounge Radio

2717
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:49,000
But fear not we have plenty more to get to tonight

2718
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:51,000
Including the mailbag, the FUs of the week

2719
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:53,000
Your calls and more gaming news

2720
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:55,000
And we're going to get to that all

2721
01:26:55,000 --> 01:26:57,000
After a quick break here in studio

2722
01:26:57,000 --> 01:26:59,000
At Orange Lounge Radio

2723
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:01,000
So stay tuned guys, we'll be right back with more

2724
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:07,000
Orange Lounge Radio

2725
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:09,000
Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio

2726
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:11,000
On this June the 28th of 2009

2727
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:13,000
Where we're celebrating our 7th anniversary

2728
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:15,000
Of Orange Lounge Radio

2729
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:17,000
With nothing of particular or special

2730
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:19,000
Notice we're just doing the same old crap we always do

2731
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:21,000
Although we got really in depth tonight

2732
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:23,000
In part A, kind of having a long side discussion

2733
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:25,000
But you know we're just kind of

2734
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:27,000
Just having a really chill night

2735
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:29,000
No pre-planned list of

2736
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:31,000
Topics to cover tonight

2737
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:33,000
We're just doing whatever we want to talk about tonight

2738
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:35,000
And the latest and greatest in gaming news

2739
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:37,000
We'll get back into some more news

2740
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:39,000
I'm hoping Loki has a few more stories for us

2741
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:41,000
Maybe one more story then I'm sure Jamie's got a couple too

2742
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:43,000
Sorry I'm reminiscing about

2743
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:45,000
The steak I had at Daily Grill

2744
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:47,000
Back during E3 because that was the best

2745
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:49,000
Steak ever. Where's Daily Grill? I've not heard of that

2746
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:51,000
Well this was in LA

2747
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:53,000
But they actually have one in San Francisco and one in Brentwood

2748
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:55,000
Have you ever been to Ruth Chris?

2749
01:27:55,000 --> 01:27:57,000
Uh

2750
01:27:57,000 --> 01:27:59,000
No. I'm telling you that is an incredible steak

2751
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:01,000
It's expensive

2752
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:03,000
If you and the wife go there you're gonna spend 80 bucks

2753
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:05,000
But it is

2754
01:28:05,000 --> 01:28:07,000
Good steak

2755
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:09,000
That's my favorite steak right there

2756
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:11,000
The best steak though, seriously

2757
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:13,000
Daily Grill, the New York Pepper Steak

2758
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:15,000
As cracked pepper

2759
01:28:15,000 --> 01:28:17,000
Bacon and onions on top of it

2760
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:19,000
Oh my god is it

2761
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:21,000
The best steak ever, I'm serious

2762
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:23,000
I'm gonna have to check that out at some point

2763
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:25,000
It is awesome. Wait did you go there this year during E3?

2764
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:27,000
I went this year during E3

2765
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:29,000
It was right next to our hotel

2766
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:31,000
Nice

2767
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:33,000
Anywho

2768
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:35,000
We've got some news

2769
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:37,000
Let's see which we'll pick here

2770
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:39,000
Um

2771
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:41,000
How about

2772
01:28:41,000 --> 01:28:43,000
Let's talk about how crappy home is

2773
01:28:43,000 --> 01:28:45,000
Fewer than one in three

2774
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:47,000
PS3 systems are connected to

2775
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:49,000
PlayStation Home

2776
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:51,000
According to Peter Edward

2777
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:53,000
The director of PlayStation Home

2778
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:55,000
Europe, PlayStation Home has gained

2779
01:28:55,000 --> 01:28:57,000
7 million users

2780
01:28:57,000 --> 01:28:59,000
worldwide with 3 million in Europe alone

2781
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:01,000
And

2782
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:03,000
But you know of course with

2783
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:05,000
21 million PS3 sold worldwide

2784
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:07,000
That's you know

2785
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:09,000
Less than one third so

2786
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:11,000
He considers it

2787
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:13,000
You know

2788
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:15,000
Well he considers home of course

2789
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:17,000
The starting point for PlayStation 3 online

2790
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:19,000
Of course I would say he's a little bit

2791
01:29:19,000 --> 01:29:21,000
Biased since you know he is the director of

2792
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:23,000
PlayStation Home he kind of has to say that

2793
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:25,000
But um

2794
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:27,000
I don't know it's just

2795
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:29,000
If a lot of people are like

2796
01:29:29,000 --> 01:29:31,000
Me they just

2797
01:29:31,000 --> 01:29:33,000
It's neat it's a neat idea

2798
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:35,000
But

2799
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:37,000
I don't know I just don't want to go

2800
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:39,000
To PlayStation Home

2801
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:41,000
Okay but here's my thing

2802
01:29:41,000 --> 01:29:43,000
Like I realize that's how the blogs are kind of skewing this

2803
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:45,000
Is that oh nobody's on PlayStation Home

2804
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:47,000
But since when was 7 million

2805
01:29:47,000 --> 01:29:49,000
A bad number of people to have using your thing

2806
01:29:49,000 --> 01:29:51,000
I mean isn't that actually kind of good

2807
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:53,000
I mean at risk of sounding like a Sony fanboy

2808
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:55,000
Is one in three in this case really

2809
01:29:55,000 --> 01:29:57,000
That bad because

2810
01:29:57,000 --> 01:29:59,000
Yes I understand Home is free

2811
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:01,000
I guess but think about how many people are buying their

2812
01:30:01,000 --> 01:30:03,000
PlayStation 3's let's be honest and here's

2813
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:05,000
Here's my little you know let's look at both sides

2814
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:07,000
Of the coin is that I actually think these numbers are

2815
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:09,000
Pretty good for Home but the bad side is

2816
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:11,000
I think there's a lot of people that are buying their PlayStation 3's

2817
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:13,000
Just for Blu-ray players I think their expectations

2818
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:15,000
Were though that 100% of the people

2819
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:17,000
Would be well dream the F on

2820
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:19,000
There are 100 people on Xbox Live

2821
01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:21,000
Well okay granted you have to pay for Xbox Live

2822
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:23,000
But I would bet there's

2823
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:25,000
Not even 100% of people

2824
01:30:25,000 --> 01:30:27,000
That have an Xbox profile

2825
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:29,000
I bet there's a lot of people

2826
01:30:29,000 --> 01:30:31,000
That buy their Xbox 360

2827
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:33,000
And just put the game in and play

2828
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:35,000
Because you don't always have to sign into profiles

2829
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:37,000
And stuff to play games you know what I mean

2830
01:30:37,000 --> 01:30:39,000
Like I bet you there's a lot of folks

2831
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:41,000
That don't bother with all this other stuff

2832
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:43,000
That just use their console to play games

2833
01:30:43,000 --> 01:30:45,000
And that's it

2834
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:47,000
But you know

2835
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:49,000
It's not the splash they were hoping

2836
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:51,000
To make

2837
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:53,000
I just don't think 7 million is that bad of a number

2838
01:30:53,000 --> 01:30:55,000
I got to say

2839
01:30:55,000 --> 01:30:57,000
I'm surprised yeah sj100mat in our chat room

2840
01:30:57,000 --> 01:30:59,000
Chat.orangelandtrader.com says

2841
01:30:59,000 --> 01:31:01,000
There are 7 million PS3 owners

2842
01:31:01,000 --> 01:31:03,000
Actually there's 21 million PS3 owners

2843
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:05,000
I'm one of them I think we all are

2844
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:07,000
That's what I actually just said

2845
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:09,000
All three of us own one

2846
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:11,000
So it took me a little while

2847
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:13,000
To get on board

2848
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:15,000
My question though is this accounts

2849
01:31:15,000 --> 01:31:17,000
Or is this actually users

2850
01:31:17,000 --> 01:31:19,000
You know individual consoles because

2851
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:21,000
I don't know about you but I have four accounts on my

2852
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:23,000
You know

2853
01:31:23,000 --> 01:31:25,000
PlayStation 3

2854
01:31:25,000 --> 01:31:27,000
One for each region so I can download you know

2855
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:29,000
Games in different regions and then one for Nelly

2856
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:31,000
Yeah but you're an anomaly

2857
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:33,000
You're not the normal type of player

2858
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:35,000
You know even if they were counting accounts

2859
01:31:35,000 --> 01:31:37,000
I don't think it would make that big of a difference at the end of the day

2860
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:39,000
So

2861
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:41,000
Let's see

2862
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:43,000
Corypheus in chat says

2863
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:45,000
And you many of those owners now

2864
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:47,000
PS3 Paperweight owners

2865
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:49,000
Were owners of an expensive Blu-ray

2866
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:51,000
I don't know

2867
01:31:51,000 --> 01:31:53,000
There's still games I've played on PlayStation 3

2868
01:31:53,000 --> 01:31:55,000
When I got mine it was a cheap Blu-ray player

2869
01:31:55,000 --> 01:31:57,000
Yeah I know it was a cheap Blu-ray player at the time

2870
01:31:57,000 --> 01:31:59,000
I didn't pay for mine so

2871
01:31:59,000 --> 01:32:01,000
Can't get much cheaper than that

2872
01:32:01,000 --> 01:32:03,000
Dark Soccer

2873
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:05,000
Do you have anything you want to cover?

2874
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:07,000
Actually I do

2875
01:32:07,000 --> 01:32:09,000
My feet with socks no I'm kidding

2876
01:32:09,000 --> 01:32:11,000
They want to expand

2877
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:13,000
The cameras

2878
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:15,000
Through a broader online service

2879
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:17,000
So they want to use

2880
01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:19,000
TV, the cameras, your phones

2881
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:21,000
And they're thinking of launching that

2882
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:23,000
Around Spring 2010

2883
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:25,000
Or at least that's their general idea

2884
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:27,000
There was an article

2885
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:29,000
In Fortune about

2886
01:32:29,000 --> 01:32:31,000
What they want to do

2887
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:33,000
And it's basically saying

2888
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:35,000
That they want it to be the ultimate multimedia

2889
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:37,000
Experience

2890
01:32:37,000 --> 01:32:39,000
That, you know, if you have

2891
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:41,000
The multiple Sony products

2892
01:32:41,000 --> 01:32:43,000
They're all linked together

2893
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:45,000
Kaz Hirai

2894
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:47,000
Was actually quoted saying

2895
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:49,000
That the service will overlay the backbone of the PlayStation

2896
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:51,000
Network but be broader and more open

2897
01:32:51,000 --> 01:32:53,000
So you'd be able to

2898
01:32:53,000 --> 01:32:55,000
Download movies to TV

2899
01:32:55,000 --> 01:32:57,000
Share photos between devices, friends

2900
01:32:57,000 --> 01:32:59,000
So basically they want to make

2901
01:32:59,000 --> 01:33:01,000
Xbox Live

2902
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:05,000
But I don't understand

2903
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:07,000
What's this whole camera supposed to be?

2904
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:09,000
I don't get it

2905
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:11,000
They're saying that it's just part of the whole thing

2906
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:13,000
They want to

2907
01:33:13,000 --> 01:33:15,000
Incorporate all of their electronic

2908
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:17,000
Products into this big network

2909
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:19,000
I see, okay

2910
01:33:19,000 --> 01:33:21,000
It's spreading around

2911
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:23,000
The company brand, why not?

2912
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:25,000
Where do you think most of those movies come from?

2913
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:27,000
Sony Pictures, right?

2914
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:29,000
They're saying that basically they're going to start small

2915
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:31,000
And work from there

2916
01:33:31,000 --> 01:33:33,000
To just basically

2917
01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:35,000
Get all the different services that function with each device

2918
01:33:35,000 --> 01:33:37,000
And then roll out their plan

2919
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:39,000
I don't think I would ever

2920
01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:41,000
Buy a camera

2921
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:43,000
On PlayStation Network

2922
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:45,000
But, you know, if

2923
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:47,000
Even only a small handful of people do

2924
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:49,000
It's not that much resources to probably put this up for sale

2925
01:33:49,000 --> 01:33:51,000
On there, so why not?

2926
01:33:51,000 --> 01:33:53,000
You know what I'd actually like to see do

2927
01:33:53,000 --> 01:33:55,000
If they're really working on networking people

2928
01:33:55,000 --> 01:33:57,000
Is actually have a true

2929
01:33:57,000 --> 01:33:59,000
Teleconference

2930
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:01,000
Video conference ability

2931
01:34:01,000 --> 01:34:03,000
Kind of do that with Xbox 360

2932
01:34:03,000 --> 01:34:05,000
But that's just one to one, right?

2933
01:34:05,000 --> 01:34:07,000
You can't really do more than one camera chat

2934
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:09,000
Yeah, it'd be neat though if you could do like

2935
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:11,000
Your multiple chat room

2936
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:13,000
Interesting

2937
01:34:13,000 --> 01:34:15,000
Anyway, that's just my idea

2938
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:17,000
Don't steal my idea, Sony, or I'll stab you in the face

2939
01:34:17,000 --> 01:34:19,000
Shove crayons down your throat

2940
01:34:19,000 --> 01:34:21,000
Well, wait a minute

2941
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:23,000
Didn't they have the old

2942
01:34:23,000 --> 01:34:25,000
PlayStation 2, wasn't there itoy chat?

2943
01:34:25,000 --> 01:34:27,000
That came out?

2944
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:29,000
There was

2945
01:34:29,000 --> 01:34:31,000
A late that everyone had moved on

2946
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:33,000
I think to the next generation of gaming

2947
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:35,000
And people weren't really talking about itoy chat anymore

2948
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:37,000
Like I remember

2949
01:34:37,000 --> 01:34:39,000
This was a subject of a lot of mocking early on

2950
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:41,000
Because it was just, you know, like

2951
01:34:41,000 --> 01:34:43,000
Just we could see

2952
01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:45,000
The potential for abuse in this thing

2953
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:47,000
And, you know, they had talked about moderation and all that

2954
01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:49,000
I'm wondering, whatever happened

2955
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:51,000
Did this game actually come out?

2956
01:34:51,000 --> 01:34:53,000
I'm wondering if it didn't just

2957
01:34:53,000 --> 01:34:55,000
Get pulled before it ever came out

2958
01:34:55,000 --> 01:34:57,000
Now I gotta check it out

2959
01:34:57,000 --> 01:34:59,000
I totally gotta check it out now

2960
01:34:59,000 --> 01:35:01,000
I'll research that, you talk about something else, Logie

2961
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:03,000
Okay

2962
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:05,000
Let's see

2963
01:35:05,000 --> 01:35:07,000
Apparently there's another rumor

2964
01:35:07,000 --> 01:35:09,000
From the Ars Technica mole

2965
01:35:09,000 --> 01:35:11,000
Saying that there's gonna be some

2966
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:13,000
Console drops

2967
01:35:13,000 --> 01:35:15,000
Or price drops, at least

2968
01:35:15,000 --> 01:35:17,000
Coming, well, this fall

2969
01:35:17,000 --> 01:35:19,000
For both the PlayStation 3

2970
01:35:19,000 --> 01:35:21,000
And Xbox 360

2971
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:23,000
Of course

2972
01:35:23,000 --> 01:35:25,000
In the past, the Ars Technica mole

2973
01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:27,000
Has been correct about a few other things

2974
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:29,000
Including, you know, the

2975
01:35:29,000 --> 01:35:31,000
Capabilities of the PSP Go

2976
01:35:31,000 --> 01:35:33,000
Or the release of the

2977
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:35,000
Resident Evil 5, Xbox 360 bundle

2978
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:37,000
And

2979
01:35:37,000 --> 01:35:39,000
I guess the

2980
01:35:39,000 --> 01:35:41,000
360 price drop last fall

2981
01:35:41,000 --> 01:35:43,000
Apparently it says on the Sony's front

2982
01:35:43,000 --> 01:35:45,000
They're claiming that the 80GB

2983
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:47,000
PS3 will become scarce

2984
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:49,000
Over the next two months

2985
01:35:49,000 --> 01:35:51,000
And will be mostly replaced by the 160GB model

2986
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:53,000
And the

2987
01:35:53,000 --> 01:35:55,000
I guess

2988
01:35:55,000 --> 01:35:57,000
Larger model continues to sell into the fall

2989
01:35:57,000 --> 01:35:59,000
And apparently they will simultaneously

2990
01:35:59,000 --> 01:36:01,000
Announce that the

2991
01:36:01,000 --> 01:36:03,000
PS3 Slim

2992
01:36:03,000 --> 01:36:05,000
And

2993
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:07,000
The even more, I guess

2994
01:36:07,000 --> 01:36:09,000
Rumored price cuts

2995
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:11,000
Will be announced around the same time

2996
01:36:11,000 --> 01:36:13,000
And

2997
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:15,000
They don't know how much it's gonna be

2998
01:36:15,000 --> 01:36:17,000
Dropped in price, but they know

2999
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:19,000
That there will be one

3000
01:36:19,000 --> 01:36:21,000
And also, Microsoft

3001
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:23,000
Pro system apparently is gonna be

3002
01:36:23,000 --> 01:36:25,000
Phased out

3003
01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:27,000
And something else

3004
01:36:27,000 --> 01:36:29,000
Will come up in its place

3005
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:31,000
Apparently the Pro will be replaced by

3006
01:36:31,000 --> 01:36:33,000
The 120GB Elite system

3007
01:36:33,000 --> 01:36:35,000
Now wouldn't it be awesome though if they dropped the price

3008
01:36:35,000 --> 01:36:37,000
Of the Elite to the price of the Pro system now

3009
01:36:37,000 --> 01:36:39,000
Then they may come out with something

3010
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:41,000
Later on that's even more, maybe something

3011
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:43,000
With Project Intel built in

3012
01:36:43,000 --> 01:36:45,000
I don't know

3013
01:36:45,000 --> 01:36:47,000
Or maybe a slimmer 360

3014
01:36:47,000 --> 01:36:49,000
Who knows, that might be neat

3015
01:36:49,000 --> 01:36:51,000
But apparently

3016
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:53,000
The 120GB

3017
01:36:53,000 --> 01:36:55,000
Or the 120GB Elite

3018
01:36:55,000 --> 01:36:57,000
Will undergo a price cut

3019
01:36:57,000 --> 01:36:59,000
In September

3020
01:36:59,000 --> 01:37:01,000
And there will be some new bundles coming out in October

3021
01:37:01,000 --> 01:37:03,000
And that makes sense because they're releasing

3022
01:37:03,000 --> 01:37:05,000
New

3023
01:37:05,000 --> 01:37:07,000
Bundles all the time

3024
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:09,000
By the way

3025
01:37:09,000 --> 01:37:11,000
I did the research on itoy chat

3026
01:37:11,000 --> 01:37:13,000
It's kinda hard to figure it out

3027
01:37:13,000 --> 01:37:15,000
I mean if this game did come out

3028
01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:17,000
It kinda landed with a thud

3029
01:37:17,000 --> 01:37:19,000
It only came out in the UK

3030
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:21,000
That's what I'm able to kinda put together here

3031
01:37:21,000 --> 01:37:23,000
Is that it did come out in the UK in 2005

3032
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:25,000
That must have been a long time ago

3033
01:37:25,000 --> 01:37:27,000
I remember selling it so I don't think it actually

3034
01:37:27,000 --> 01:37:29,000
Came out over here

3035
01:37:29,000 --> 01:37:31,000
I do remember selling some really stupid things

3036
01:37:31,000 --> 01:37:33,000
Although itoy chat

3037
01:37:33,000 --> 01:37:35,000
I don't think was ever one of them

3038
01:37:35,000 --> 01:37:37,000
Again I hate to bring up an old subject

3039
01:37:37,000 --> 01:37:39,000
But itoy is what makes me nervous

3040
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:41,000
Of things like Project Natal

3041
01:37:41,000 --> 01:37:43,000
And these other motion controllers

3042
01:37:43,000 --> 01:37:45,000
Especially Project Natal

3043
01:37:45,000 --> 01:37:47,000
Is pretty much the Sony motion control

3044
01:37:47,000 --> 01:37:49,000
Because the Sony motion control feels to me

3045
01:37:49,000 --> 01:37:51,000
More of a souped up Wii type thing

3046
01:37:51,000 --> 01:37:53,000
Where there's sensors in the controller itself

3047
01:37:53,000 --> 01:37:55,000
And the camera

3048
01:37:55,000 --> 01:37:57,000
But Natal that relies apparently only on a camera

3049
01:37:57,000 --> 01:37:59,000
It makes me nervous because itoy

3050
01:37:59,000 --> 01:38:01,000
Was the camera too

3051
01:38:01,000 --> 01:38:03,000
It was great in theory

3052
01:38:03,000 --> 01:38:05,000
But look how old that camera technology is

3053
01:38:05,000 --> 01:38:07,000
And granted yes the Microsoft vision camera was no better

3054
01:38:07,000 --> 01:38:09,000
Absolutely not better in any way

3055
01:38:09,000 --> 01:38:11,000
In fact I might argue it was worse

3056
01:38:11,000 --> 01:38:13,000
At least the itoy actually

3057
01:38:13,000 --> 01:38:15,000
Might mock the games that came out for it

3058
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:17,000
At least it had some sport

3059
01:38:17,000 --> 01:38:19,000
I believe that the company that they bought

3060
01:38:19,000 --> 01:38:21,000
I'd rather play itoy chat than totem ball

3061
01:38:23,000 --> 01:38:25,000
Yes totem ball really sucked

3062
01:38:25,000 --> 01:38:29,000
And itoy play was kind of okay

3063
01:38:29,000 --> 01:38:31,000
It was funny

3064
01:38:31,000 --> 01:38:33,000
And hell we used it for our webcam

3065
01:38:33,000 --> 01:38:35,000
For a while

3066
01:38:37,000 --> 01:38:39,000
I'm more confident that they would

3067
01:38:39,000 --> 01:38:41,000
Test this and test this and test this

3068
01:38:41,000 --> 01:38:43,000
They're not going to just

3069
01:38:43,000 --> 01:38:45,000
Splash the market with this

3070
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:47,000
Project Natal and have it be shit

3071
01:38:47,000 --> 01:38:49,000
I mean why would they do that

3072
01:38:49,000 --> 01:38:51,000
That really opens themselves up

3073
01:38:51,000 --> 01:38:53,000
Whereas itoy I think was more of like

3074
01:38:53,000 --> 01:38:55,000
Hey this is kind of neat

3075
01:38:55,000 --> 01:38:57,000
We'll compete against

3076
01:38:57,000 --> 01:38:59,000
Somebody with this

3077
01:38:59,000 --> 01:39:01,000
But they didn't really do anything with it

3078
01:39:01,000 --> 01:39:03,000
It was just like hey now there's games that use itoy

3079
01:39:03,000 --> 01:39:05,000
DDR hey there's hands and feet mode

3080
01:39:05,000 --> 01:39:07,000
Which sucks

3081
01:39:07,000 --> 01:39:09,000
And yet they decide

3082
01:39:09,000 --> 01:39:11,000
Hey let's do

3083
01:39:11,000 --> 01:39:13,000
Wiimote and nunchuck mode

3084
01:39:13,000 --> 01:39:15,000
Which surprisingly enough also sucks

3085
01:39:15,000 --> 01:39:17,000
And then

3086
01:39:17,000 --> 01:39:19,000
Now there's the Wii balance board mode

3087
01:39:19,000 --> 01:39:21,000
Which also sucks

3088
01:39:21,000 --> 01:39:23,000
So maybe they should go and learn

3089
01:39:23,000 --> 01:39:25,000
Their lesson from this which is

3090
01:39:25,000 --> 01:39:27,000
The extra modes while an interesting idea

3091
01:39:27,000 --> 01:39:29,000
And maybe slightly consider

3092
01:39:29,000 --> 01:39:31,000
Innovative maybe

3093
01:39:31,000 --> 01:39:33,000
As a stretch

3094
01:39:33,000 --> 01:39:35,000
They will always suck

3095
01:39:35,000 --> 01:39:37,000
And 8 arrow mode

3096
01:39:37,000 --> 01:39:39,000
Any guess? It's gonna suck

3097
01:39:39,000 --> 01:39:41,000
Alright well I'm hearing Loki

3098
01:39:41,000 --> 01:39:43,000
Getting a little angry over there so I think it might be

3099
01:39:43,000 --> 01:39:45,000
About time to bring on the FUs of the week

3100
01:39:45,000 --> 01:39:47,000
But how could we do an FUs of the week segment

3101
01:39:47,000 --> 01:39:49,000
Without starting it off with a story about a dumb

3102
01:39:49,000 --> 01:39:51,000
Criminal and yes there was a criminal

3103
01:39:51,000 --> 01:39:53,000
In Pittsburgh where apparently

3104
01:39:53,000 --> 01:39:55,000
In the town of East Liberty somebody

3105
01:39:55,000 --> 01:39:57,000
Tried to break into a GameStop store

3106
01:39:57,000 --> 01:39:59,000
But they didn't do it the old fashioned way

3107
01:39:59,000 --> 01:40:01,000
No they climbed in through the ceiling

3108
01:40:01,000 --> 01:40:03,000
That's right they decided to cut open the ceiling

3109
01:40:03,000 --> 01:40:05,000
In another I guess nearby place in the shopping center

3110
01:40:05,000 --> 01:40:07,000
And climbed into the GameStop

3111
01:40:07,000 --> 01:40:09,000
Basically through the roof but here was the problem

3112
01:40:09,000 --> 01:40:11,000
Once they got into the store they couldn't

3113
01:40:11,000 --> 01:40:13,000
Get out because the front door and the back door

3114
01:40:13,000 --> 01:40:15,000
Were locked and I guess it was not the type of door

3115
01:40:15,000 --> 01:40:17,000
You can unlock from the inside

3116
01:40:17,000 --> 01:40:19,000
You need a key to open that up

3117
01:40:19,000 --> 01:40:21,000
So how did the burglar get out?

3118
01:40:21,000 --> 01:40:23,000
Well they went back through the hole that they made

3119
01:40:23,000 --> 01:40:25,000
They climbed back up through the hole

3120
01:40:25,000 --> 01:40:27,000
They do have surveillance tape but no sign of the criminal yet

3121
01:40:27,000 --> 01:40:29,000
But the thing that makes this most hilarious

3122
01:40:29,000 --> 01:40:31,000
Of all they didn't walk away with a damn thing

3123
01:40:31,000 --> 01:40:33,000
Damn thing

3124
01:40:33,000 --> 01:40:35,000
So uh

3125
01:40:35,000 --> 01:40:37,000
This guy just wasted everybody's time

3126
01:40:37,000 --> 01:40:39,000
In this case and whenever we hear

3127
01:40:39,000 --> 01:40:41,000
About a dumb criminal I'm sure it always

3128
01:40:41,000 --> 01:40:43,000
Inspires us to see a little angsty here on the show

3129
01:40:43,000 --> 01:40:45,000
So uh yeah

3130
01:40:45,000 --> 01:41:03,000
Let's do the FUs of the week

3131
01:41:03,000 --> 01:41:07,000
FU to pain and heat

3132
01:41:07,000 --> 01:41:11,000
Extreme heat

3133
01:41:11,000 --> 01:41:13,000
Whoops didn't mean to cut the music out there

3134
01:41:13,000 --> 01:41:15,000
Um it's hot

3135
01:41:15,000 --> 01:41:17,000
So if you do it being hot

3136
01:41:19,000 --> 01:41:21,000
I would also say FU to the fact that it's hot

3137
01:41:21,000 --> 01:41:23,000
Hotter than hell in here

3138
01:41:23,000 --> 01:41:25,000
Not in here but out there

3139
01:41:25,000 --> 01:41:29,000
And then I would say FU as well to um

3140
01:41:29,000 --> 01:41:31,000
Ah I had something else on my mind

3141
01:41:31,000 --> 01:41:33,000
FU to go to the doctor on my birthday

3142
01:41:33,000 --> 01:41:35,000
That's no fun who wants to go to the doctor for their birthday?

3143
01:41:37,000 --> 01:41:39,000
FU to getting old

3144
01:41:39,000 --> 01:41:41,000
I like the age I was when I started this show

3145
01:41:41,000 --> 01:41:43,000
24

3146
01:41:43,000 --> 01:41:45,000
I think I was then

3147
01:41:45,000 --> 01:41:47,000
31 now what?

3148
01:41:47,000 --> 01:41:49,000
Things get better in your 30s they really do

3149
01:41:49,000 --> 01:41:51,000
I hope you're right

3150
01:41:51,000 --> 01:41:53,000
We'll see

3151
01:41:53,000 --> 01:41:55,000
First of all you don't have the stupid angst you had in your 20s

3152
01:41:55,000 --> 01:41:57,000
And you give less of a fuck the older you get

3153
01:41:57,000 --> 01:41:59,000
I don't know I do still have a lot of that angst

3154
01:41:59,000 --> 01:42:01,000
Once in a while

3155
01:42:01,000 --> 01:42:03,000
I take that back

3156
01:42:03,000 --> 01:42:05,000
I have given less of a fuck the older I get

3157
01:42:05,000 --> 01:42:07,000
How's that?

3158
01:42:07,000 --> 01:42:09,000
I don't give a fuck

3159
01:42:09,000 --> 01:42:11,000
More gaming news

3160
01:42:11,000 --> 01:42:13,000
Do you have anything else tonight Dark Saga?

3161
01:42:13,000 --> 01:42:15,000
Just release dates right?

3162
01:42:15,000 --> 01:42:17,000
Oh god I have that too

3163
01:42:17,000 --> 01:42:19,000
Why don't we just get into release dates here

3164
01:42:19,000 --> 01:42:21,000
Tonight's just kind of a very whatever kind of show

3165
01:42:21,000 --> 01:42:23,000
Fuck it night here on Orange Lounge Radio

3166
01:42:23,000 --> 01:42:25,000
Why not it's our little 7th birthday here

3167
01:42:25,000 --> 01:42:27,000
We're just screwing around tonight

3168
01:42:27,000 --> 01:42:29,000
Dark Saga is going to kick off some release dates

3169
01:42:29,000 --> 01:42:31,000
As soon as she gets it brought up there on her monitor

3170
01:42:31,000 --> 01:42:33,000
Start off with the UK

3171
01:42:33,000 --> 01:42:35,000
And what's coming out overseas across the pond

3172
01:42:35,000 --> 01:42:37,000
Oh yeah it's July isn't it

3173
01:42:37,000 --> 01:42:39,000
Or it will be

3174
01:42:39,000 --> 01:42:41,000
So let's go ahead and start off with our

3175
01:42:41,000 --> 01:42:43,000
Our July releases

3176
01:42:43,000 --> 01:42:45,000
How's that sound?

3177
01:42:45,000 --> 01:42:49,000
Oh god did they actually give me any July releases on here?

3178
01:42:49,000 --> 01:42:51,000
No

3179
01:42:51,000 --> 01:42:53,000
They're not listening to July releases

3180
01:42:53,000 --> 01:42:55,000
Well what good is that?

3181
01:42:55,000 --> 01:42:57,000
Oh there we go

3182
01:42:57,000 --> 01:42:59,000
Sorry

3183
01:42:59,000 --> 01:43:01,000
Brain broken sorry

3184
01:43:01,000 --> 01:43:03,000
The heat has melted her brain

3185
01:43:03,000 --> 01:43:05,000
God I almost did

3186
01:43:05,000 --> 01:43:07,000
Punisher No Mercy on Playstation 3

3187
01:43:07,000 --> 01:43:09,000
We have on the 3rd

3188
01:43:09,000 --> 01:43:11,000

3189
01:43:11,000 --> 01:43:13,000

3190
01:43:13,000 --> 01:43:15,000
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince

3191
01:43:15,000 --> 01:43:17,000
On a bunch of systems

3192
01:43:17,000 --> 01:43:19,000
Street Fighter IV on PC

3193
01:43:19,000 --> 01:43:23,000
Tiger Woods PGA Tour 10

3194
01:43:23,000 --> 01:43:25,000
And then

3195
01:43:25,000 --> 01:43:27,000
That's it

3196
01:43:27,000 --> 01:43:29,000
Gonna get some Monkey Island after that

3197
01:43:29,000 --> 01:43:31,000
Sweet

3198
01:43:31,000 --> 01:43:33,000
Let's get into some Japanese release dates

3199
01:43:33,000 --> 01:43:35,000
And see what's coming out

3200
01:43:35,000 --> 01:43:37,000
On the other side of the

3201
01:43:37,000 --> 01:43:39,000
Pond over across the Pacific

3202
01:43:39,000 --> 01:43:41,000
Only some price cuts on the

3203
01:43:41,000 --> 01:43:43,000
Xbox 360 this week for Bioshock

3204
01:43:43,000 --> 01:43:45,000
Infinite Undiscovery and Shin Sengoku

3205
01:43:45,000 --> 01:43:47,000
Musou 5 all getting price

3206
01:43:47,000 --> 01:43:49,000
Cuts this week which I believe that

3207
01:43:49,000 --> 01:43:51,000
Last one was Dynasty Warriors if not mistaken

3208
01:43:51,000 --> 01:43:53,000
Yeah that's Dynasty Warriors

3209
01:43:53,000 --> 01:43:55,000
Empires I think or Dynasty Warriors

3210
01:43:55,000 --> 01:43:57,000
Five Empires

3211
01:43:57,000 --> 01:43:59,000
Six Empires

3212
01:43:59,000 --> 01:44:01,000
That is also getting a price drop on the Playstation 3

3213
01:44:01,000 --> 01:44:03,000
For the fancy HD systems

3214
01:44:03,000 --> 01:44:05,000
On the Nintendo Wii this week

3215
01:44:05,000 --> 01:44:07,000
Grand Slam Tennis

3216
01:44:07,000 --> 01:44:09,000
Is really the only game you have to look forward to

3217
01:44:09,000 --> 01:44:11,000
On the Wii this week coming out from EA

3218
01:44:11,000 --> 01:44:13,000
Looks to be a pretty slow week

3219
01:44:13,000 --> 01:44:15,000
Over there in Japan but if you are

3220
01:44:15,000 --> 01:44:17,000
Still a fan of the Playstation 2

3221
01:44:17,000 --> 01:44:19,000
I got nothing for you this week

3222
01:44:19,000 --> 01:44:21,000
But there's a baseball game coming out next week

3223
01:44:21,000 --> 01:44:23,000
You can look for that

3224
01:44:23,000 --> 01:44:25,000
Coming out on the Nintendo DS

3225
01:44:25,000 --> 01:44:27,000
We have Mina no Oekake

3226
01:44:27,000 --> 01:44:29,000
Yasan

3227
01:44:29,000 --> 01:44:31,000
This is going to be some type of drawing game

3228
01:44:31,000 --> 01:44:33,000
Because I recognize the Oekake from being that whole

3229
01:44:33,000 --> 01:44:35,000
Drawing on the internet thing

3230
01:44:35,000 --> 01:44:37,000
That looks to be exactly what this is

3231
01:44:37,000 --> 01:44:39,000
Probably some type of like share with your friends drawing

3232
01:44:39,000 --> 01:44:41,000
Draw a penis on the internet

3233
01:44:41,000 --> 01:44:43,000
It looks like it's teaching you how to draw Oekake

3234
01:44:43,000 --> 01:44:45,000
Is what it's doing because I see this little like

3235
01:44:45,000 --> 01:44:47,000
It's walking you through how to draw

3236
01:44:47,000 --> 01:44:49,000
Like a happy little sheep there

3237
01:44:49,000 --> 01:44:51,000
So that looks like a fun little game

3238
01:44:51,000 --> 01:44:53,000
It's like painting training

3239
01:44:53,000 --> 01:44:55,000
I guess you could call that game

3240
01:44:55,000 --> 01:44:57,000
That's really it on the DS

3241
01:44:57,000 --> 01:44:59,000
Anything on the PSP

3242
01:44:59,000 --> 01:45:01,000
I guess this is a slow week when your biggest release

3243
01:45:01,000 --> 01:45:03,000
Is an Oekake game

3244
01:45:03,000 --> 01:45:05,000
Oh well they do have this game

3245
01:45:05,000 --> 01:45:07,000
Hatsune Miku Project Diva

3246
01:45:07,000 --> 01:45:09,000
Comes out for Sega this week

3247
01:45:09,000 --> 01:45:11,000
You know what Hatsune Miku is right?

3248
01:45:11,000 --> 01:45:13,000
The Vocaloid

3249
01:45:13,000 --> 01:45:15,000
You know where

3250
01:45:15,000 --> 01:45:17,000
You input the words

3251
01:45:17,000 --> 01:45:19,000
The tune and everything and then she sings it

3252
01:45:19,000 --> 01:45:21,000
This looks to be yeah a type of music game

3253
01:45:21,000 --> 01:45:23,000
Actually coming out over there

3254
01:45:23,000 --> 01:45:25,000
Having what's it on?

3255
01:45:25,000 --> 01:45:27,000
PSP

3256
01:45:27,000 --> 01:45:29,000
Yeah having the Vocaloid game on PSP is pretty cool

3257
01:45:29,000 --> 01:45:31,000
Rob really you should

3258
01:45:31,000 --> 01:45:33,000
I'm gonna find you something to play

3259
01:45:33,000 --> 01:45:35,000
Interesting yeah you actually

3260
01:45:35,000 --> 01:45:37,000
Kinda this is a rhythm game that you

3261
01:45:37,000 --> 01:45:39,000
Put in these

3262
01:45:39,000 --> 01:45:41,000
Kinda another type of syncing game

3263
01:45:41,000 --> 01:45:43,000
And it makes your dance

3264
01:45:43,000 --> 01:45:45,000
So check that out

3265
01:45:45,000 --> 01:45:47,000
That would be a big release coming out this week

3266
01:45:47,000 --> 01:45:49,000
Over there in Japan

3267
01:45:49,000 --> 01:45:51,000
That's it for Japanese release dates

3268
01:45:51,000 --> 01:45:53,000
In the US there's

3269
01:45:53,000 --> 01:45:55,000
Kata and Half-Blood Prince

3270
01:45:55,000 --> 01:45:57,000
Which will be on all platforms

3271
01:45:57,000 --> 01:45:59,000
Available for gaming

3272
01:45:59,000 --> 01:46:01,000
Steam Bot Chronicles Battle Tournament

3273
01:46:01,000 --> 01:46:03,000
On the PSP

3274
01:46:03,000 --> 01:46:05,000
So a free release of that

3275
01:46:05,000 --> 01:46:07,000
Or at least a port of the game I guess

3276
01:46:07,000 --> 01:46:09,000
Street Fighter IV on PC

3277
01:46:09,000 --> 01:46:11,000
Two Mega Man Star Force games

3278
01:46:11,000 --> 01:46:13,000
Mega Man Star Force 3

3279
01:46:13,000 --> 01:46:15,000
Red Joker

3280
01:46:15,000 --> 01:46:17,000
And Black Ace

3281
01:46:17,000 --> 01:46:19,000
Also

3282
01:46:19,000 --> 01:46:21,000
Ice Age Dawn of the Diasaurs

3283
01:46:21,000 --> 01:46:23,000
Which all platforms

3284
01:46:23,000 --> 01:46:25,000
And Grand Theft Auto 3

3285
01:46:25,000 --> 01:46:27,000
Or I should say Grand Theft Auto 3

3286
01:46:27,000 --> 01:46:29,000
Vice City

3287
01:46:29,000 --> 01:46:31,000
And San Andreas are all coming

3288
01:46:31,000 --> 01:46:33,000
Together in a brand new

3289
01:46:33,000 --> 01:46:35,000
PC trilogy that's being pre-released

3290
01:46:35,000 --> 01:46:37,000
Call of War is Bound in Blood

3291
01:46:37,000 --> 01:46:39,000
On PS3 and Xbox 360

3292
01:46:39,000 --> 01:46:41,000
Treasure World

3293
01:46:41,000 --> 01:46:43,000
Which is a DS game that uses

3294
01:46:43,000 --> 01:46:45,000
Your Wi-Fi signals to find treasure

3295
01:46:45,000 --> 01:46:47,000
That's kinda neat

3296
01:46:47,000 --> 01:46:49,000
So that'll be coming out in the DS

3297
01:46:49,000 --> 01:46:51,000
Ruger Twisted Towers

3298
01:46:51,000 --> 01:46:53,000
On the Wii

3299
01:46:53,000 --> 01:46:55,000
And I believe there's another Ruger game

3300
01:46:55,000 --> 01:46:57,000
Coming out in DS

3301
01:46:57,000 --> 01:46:59,000
Now this is a sequel to an Xbox Live Arcade game isn't it?

3302
01:46:59,000 --> 01:47:01,000
I think so

3303
01:47:01,000 --> 01:47:03,000
Blaze Blue Calamity Trigger

3304
01:47:03,000 --> 01:47:05,000
Sort of a launch

3305
01:47:05,000 --> 01:47:07,000
Limited editions coming out on

3306
01:47:07,000 --> 01:47:09,000
PS3 and Xbox 360 as well

3307
01:47:09,000 --> 01:47:11,000
Ummm

3308
01:47:11,000 --> 01:47:13,000
Let's see

3309
01:47:13,000 --> 01:47:15,000
And then a smaller

3310
01:47:15,000 --> 01:47:17,000
360 game that not a lot of people have heard about

3311
01:47:17,000 --> 01:47:19,000
Infernal Hell's Vengeance

3312
01:47:19,000 --> 01:47:21,000
Which was on PC a little bit earlier this year

3313
01:47:21,000 --> 01:47:23,000
That's making its way out to

3314
01:47:23,000 --> 01:47:25,000
Xbox 360 at a budget

3315
01:47:25,000 --> 01:47:27,000
$39.99

3316
01:47:27,000 --> 01:47:29,000
I guess that's not really too budget

3317
01:47:29,000 --> 01:47:31,000
More budget than full price

3318
01:47:31,000 --> 01:47:33,000
Ruger Attack which is on the DS

3319
01:47:33,000 --> 01:47:35,000
Also another Ruger sequel

3320
01:47:35,000 --> 01:47:37,000
Ummm

3321
01:47:37,000 --> 01:47:39,000
And then that's it for this week

3322
01:47:39,000 --> 01:47:41,000
I'm kind of happy to see

3323
01:47:41,000 --> 01:47:43,000
Arma 2 is coming out next week

3324
01:47:43,000 --> 01:47:45,000
And I still haven't gotten a chance to play the

3325
01:47:45,000 --> 01:47:47,000
Actual

3326
01:47:47,000 --> 01:47:49,000
Steam version but

3327
01:47:49,000 --> 01:47:51,000
Looks cool

3328
01:47:51,000 --> 01:47:53,000
Alright so backing up to the Japanese release

3329
01:47:53,000 --> 01:47:55,000
States a little bit, Dark Soccer you sent me this YouTube

3330
01:47:55,000 --> 01:47:57,000
What the hell is this I'm about to look at here?

3331
01:47:57,000 --> 01:47:59,000
This is what the

3332
01:47:59,000 --> 01:48:01,000
Vocaloid is like

3333
01:48:01,000 --> 01:48:03,000
You're gonna turn it up

3334
01:48:03,000 --> 01:48:05,000
Oh

3335
01:48:09,000 --> 01:48:11,000
This is just some really

3336
01:48:11,000 --> 01:48:13,000
Weird version of Don't Worry Be Happy

3337
01:48:13,000 --> 01:48:15,000
Well I picked something in English

3338
01:48:15,000 --> 01:48:17,000
But you input the words

3339
01:48:17,000 --> 01:48:19,000
And the tune and everything

3340
01:48:19,000 --> 01:48:21,000
And it plays it back like she's

3341
01:48:21,000 --> 01:48:23,000
Singing and she's your virtual idol

3342
01:48:23,000 --> 01:48:25,000
Oh interesting

3343
01:48:25,000 --> 01:48:27,000
So you're actually like pushing the buttons to sing?

3344
01:48:27,000 --> 01:48:29,000
No you just input everything

3345
01:48:29,000 --> 01:48:31,000
Ahead of time and then

3346
01:48:31,000 --> 01:48:33,000
Watch it play through

3347
01:48:33,000 --> 01:48:35,000
If there's one of her doing

3348
01:48:35,000 --> 01:48:37,000
Caramel dancing I'll find it

3349
01:48:37,000 --> 01:48:39,000
No thank you that's alright

3350
01:48:39,000 --> 01:48:41,000
But I think that's

3351
01:48:41,000 --> 01:48:43,000
The music maker

3352
01:48:43,000 --> 01:48:45,000
Well the PC ones are I don't know exactly

3353
01:48:45,000 --> 01:48:47,000
How the PSP one is going to be

3354
01:48:47,000 --> 01:48:49,000
But ever since the first one came out

3355
01:48:49,000 --> 01:48:51,000
There's been a ton of

3356
01:48:51,000 --> 01:48:53,000
New Vocaloids and

3357
01:48:53,000 --> 01:48:55,000
Everything it's pretty big

3358
01:48:59,000 --> 01:49:01,000
I think this is what a Dark Soccer

3359
01:49:01,000 --> 01:49:03,000
One is going to show

3360
01:49:03,000 --> 01:49:05,000
I think that's an

3361
01:49:05,000 --> 01:49:15,000
Animation that someone did

3362
01:49:15,000 --> 01:49:17,000
I'm going to park really cute

3363
01:49:17,000 --> 01:49:19,000
But yeah

3364
01:49:19,000 --> 01:49:21,000
Alright let's get back into some more

3365
01:49:21,000 --> 01:49:23,000
News, Loki you got anything for us?

3366
01:49:23,000 --> 01:49:25,000
Yeah sure why not

3367
01:49:25,000 --> 01:49:27,000
Apparently EEA

3368
01:49:27,000 --> 01:49:29,000
Is calling their Sims 3 leak

3369
01:49:29,000 --> 01:49:31,000
It's demo program

3370
01:49:31,000 --> 01:49:33,000
Saying that

3371
01:49:33,000 --> 01:49:35,000
You know you've identified our

3372
01:49:35,000 --> 01:49:37,000
Secret marketing campaign

3373
01:49:37,000 --> 01:49:39,000
EA CEO John

3374
01:49:39,000 --> 01:49:41,000
I'm not even going to try to pronounce

3375
01:49:41,000 --> 01:49:43,000
His last name

3376
01:49:43,000 --> 01:49:45,000
Ricotelio I guess

3377
01:49:45,000 --> 01:49:47,000
That was actually pretty accurate

3378
01:49:47,000 --> 01:49:49,000
It's a large scale

3379
01:49:49,000 --> 01:49:51,000
Form of large scale

3380
01:49:51,000 --> 01:49:53,000
Large scale piracy I guess

3381
01:49:53,000 --> 01:49:55,000
Was a pre-release version of

3382
01:49:55,000 --> 01:49:57,000
The Sims 3

3383
01:49:57,000 --> 01:49:59,000
Basically saying that

3384
01:49:59,000 --> 01:50:01,000
It was a way to

3385
01:50:01,000 --> 01:50:03,000
I guess

3386
01:50:03,000 --> 01:50:05,000
Figure out

3387
01:50:05,000 --> 01:50:07,000
Some data and stuff from this experiment

3388
01:50:07,000 --> 01:50:09,000
That they may

3389
01:50:09,000 --> 01:50:11,000
They've gotten a lot of people to buy the game

3390
01:50:11,000 --> 01:50:13,000
Based on trying this version of the game

3391
01:50:13,000 --> 01:50:15,000
That leaked out I guess

3392
01:50:15,000 --> 01:50:17,000
Apparently if you're a pirate consumer

3393
01:50:17,000 --> 01:50:19,000
They don't get the second town

3394
01:50:19,000 --> 01:50:21,000
They don't get all the extra content

3395
01:50:21,000 --> 01:50:23,000
And they don't get the community

3396
01:50:23,000 --> 01:50:25,000
That's bullshit

3397
01:50:25,000 --> 01:50:27,000
Yes that sounds like complete shit to me too

3398
01:50:27,000 --> 01:50:29,000
Because basically that's all download content

3399
01:50:29,000 --> 01:50:31,000
Funny enough

3400
01:50:31,000 --> 01:50:33,000
Funny enough that he would say that it's a pre-release version

3401
01:50:33,000 --> 01:50:35,000
Because right after the game came out

3402
01:50:35,000 --> 01:50:37,000
That version got leaked too

3403
01:50:37,000 --> 01:50:39,000
So oh shit

3404
01:50:39,000 --> 01:50:41,000
Guess that's not a real

3405
01:50:41,000 --> 01:50:43,000
I don't know

3406
01:50:43,000 --> 01:50:45,000
That didn't fix any problems

3407
01:50:45,000 --> 01:50:47,000
I think it sounds to me like they're making excuses

3408
01:50:47,000 --> 01:50:49,000
Because a leak like this

3409
01:50:49,000 --> 01:50:51,000
Had to have come from inside

3410
01:50:51,000 --> 01:50:53,000
Since it was leaked out like

3411
01:50:53,000 --> 01:50:55,000
Weeks early

3412
01:50:55,000 --> 01:50:57,000
He's doing a cover your ass

3413
01:50:57,000 --> 01:50:59,000
And it just makes him

3414
01:50:59,000 --> 01:51:01,000
Sound pathetic

3415
01:51:01,000 --> 01:51:03,000
So well

3416
01:51:03,000 --> 01:51:05,000
Hey whatever makes you sleep better at night

3417
01:51:05,000 --> 01:51:07,000
I guess

3418
01:51:07,000 --> 01:51:09,000
Yeah it kind of

3419
01:51:09,000 --> 01:51:11,000
Sounds more like uh oops

3420
01:51:11,000 --> 01:51:13,000
How do we explain this one or something

3421
01:51:13,000 --> 01:51:15,000
Ha ha ha you fell for it

3422
01:51:15,000 --> 01:51:17,000
Well I think what he's saying

3423
01:51:17,000 --> 01:51:19,000
Also too is what they're going to try to move towards

3424
01:51:19,000 --> 01:51:21,000
Later on

3425
01:51:21,000 --> 01:51:23,000
Is selling more services

3426
01:51:23,000 --> 01:51:25,000
So meaning like a game like this

3427
01:51:25,000 --> 01:51:27,000
Where you buy a lot of extra additional content

3428
01:51:27,000 --> 01:51:29,000
And stuff

3429
01:51:29,000 --> 01:51:31,000
And I think hey that's not a bad idea

3430
01:51:31,000 --> 01:51:33,000
If you want to say release the game for free

3431
01:51:33,000 --> 01:51:35,000
And then have download content

3432
01:51:35,000 --> 01:51:37,000
That you pay for that makes sense

3433
01:51:37,000 --> 01:51:39,000
But

3434
01:51:39,000 --> 01:51:41,000
At the end of the day what's going to end up happening

3435
01:51:41,000 --> 01:51:43,000
Except they'll probably not sell a lot of that

3436
01:51:43,000 --> 01:51:45,000
And you know what else is going to happen at the end of the day

3437
01:51:45,000 --> 01:51:47,000
Just like all the expansions for Sims 2

3438
01:51:47,000 --> 01:51:49,000
Those will get leaked out as well

3439
01:51:49,000 --> 01:51:51,000
So all your plans for

3440
01:51:51,000 --> 01:51:53,000
Download content

3441
01:51:53,000 --> 01:51:55,000
Will work

3442
01:51:55,000 --> 01:51:57,000
Just to say also everything that's available

3443
01:51:57,000 --> 01:51:59,000
On the Sims 3 store

3444
01:51:59,000 --> 01:52:01,000
Is available for download through BitTorrent

3445
01:52:01,000 --> 01:52:03,000
People have already done it

3446
01:52:03,000 --> 01:52:05,000
People are already doing

3447
01:52:05,000 --> 01:52:07,000
It's just

3448
01:52:07,000 --> 01:52:09,000
It's just

3449
01:52:09,000 --> 01:52:11,000
Really starting but people are already starting to do

3450
01:52:11,000 --> 01:52:13,000
A few custom items already

3451
01:52:13,000 --> 01:52:15,000
It's not going to be too

3452
01:52:15,000 --> 01:52:17,000
Too much longer

3453
01:52:17,000 --> 01:52:19,000
You can download everything

3454
01:52:19,000 --> 01:52:21,000
That's there in the store

3455
01:52:21,000 --> 01:52:23,000
But if you really like the game

3456
01:52:23,000 --> 01:52:25,000
You should just go buy it

3457
01:52:25,000 --> 01:52:27,000
I bought my game

3458
01:52:27,000 --> 01:52:29,000
Encourage them to make a Sims 4

3459
01:52:29,000 --> 01:52:31,000
Although Sims 4 is probably inevitable

3460
01:52:31,000 --> 01:52:33,000
Someday

3461
01:52:33,000 --> 01:52:35,000
Many years down the line

3462
01:52:35,000 --> 01:52:37,000
I just want a nice graphical upgrade to Sims 2

3463
01:52:37,000 --> 01:52:39,000
Sequel to successful franchise?

3464
01:52:39,000 --> 01:52:41,000
Nah

3465
01:52:41,000 --> 01:52:43,000
Well speaking of sequels to successful franchises

3466
01:52:43,000 --> 01:52:45,000
I want them to make pretty faces

3467
01:52:45,000 --> 01:52:47,000
And better hair

3468
01:52:47,000 --> 01:52:49,000
Well I want pretty faces and better hair

3469
01:52:49,000 --> 01:52:51,000
To play that game again

3470
01:52:51,000 --> 01:52:53,000
No not really not with Final Fantasy 14 on the horizon

3471
01:52:53,000 --> 01:52:55,000
But Final Fantasy 11 has been getting some crap

3472
01:52:55,000 --> 01:52:57,000
This week

3473
01:52:57,000 --> 01:52:59,000
Apparently they got sued this week for 5 million dollars

3474
01:52:59,000 --> 01:53:01,000
Apparently it's because they

3475
01:53:01,000 --> 01:53:03,000
Supposedly

3476
01:53:03,000 --> 01:53:05,000
Allegedly I guess is the word to use

3477
01:53:05,000 --> 01:53:07,000
They did to 100,000 customers

3478
01:53:07,000 --> 01:53:09,000
Deceived them for unfair business practices

3479
01:53:09,000 --> 01:53:11,000
False advertising

3480
01:53:11,000 --> 01:53:13,000
And unjust enrichment

3481
01:53:13,000 --> 01:53:15,000
This is Esther Leong

3482
01:53:15,000 --> 01:53:17,000
Who filed the suit in San Francisco

3483
01:53:17,000 --> 01:53:19,000
Claims that Square Enix

3484
01:53:19,000 --> 01:53:21,000
Lied about or concealed its monthly fees

3485
01:53:21,000 --> 01:53:23,000
Penalties for late payments

3486
01:53:23,000 --> 01:53:25,000
Interest restrictions and other things

3487
01:53:25,000 --> 01:53:27,000
That should have been fully disclosed

3488
01:53:27,000 --> 01:53:29,000
At points of purchase

3489
01:53:29,000 --> 01:53:31,000
So that's why they're saying they're deceptive

3490
01:53:31,000 --> 01:53:33,000
And if you go on to read the court filing

3491
01:53:33,000 --> 01:53:35,000
It actually goes on to detail it a little more

3492
01:53:35,000 --> 01:53:37,000
Saying among others

3493
01:53:37,000 --> 01:53:39,000
There's deceptive advertising, unfair and undisclosed

3494
01:53:39,000 --> 01:53:41,000
Business practices, here's a list

3495
01:53:41,000 --> 01:53:43,000
8 items on the list

3496
01:53:43,000 --> 01:53:45,000
Licensing of the online game software disguised as a sale

3497
01:53:45,000 --> 01:53:47,000
Monthly fees or fees to play the online games

3498
01:53:49,000 --> 01:53:51,000
Penalties for late payment of the fees

3499
01:53:51,000 --> 01:53:53,000
Interest charges for late payment of the fees

3500
01:53:53,000 --> 01:53:55,000
Charges while the online game account is suspended

3501
01:53:55,000 --> 01:53:57,000
Termination of the right to use the online games for late payment of the fees

3502
01:53:57,000 --> 01:54:01,000
User restrictions and conditions related to the online games

3503
01:54:03,000 --> 01:54:05,000
Termination of game data for payment of the fees

3504
01:54:05,000 --> 01:54:07,000
Granted, that's not like on the box

3505
01:54:07,000 --> 01:54:09,000
But yeah, it's all in their little fact

3506
01:54:09,000 --> 01:54:11,000
But that's after you bought the game

3507
01:54:11,000 --> 01:54:13,000
But at this point

3508
01:54:13,000 --> 01:54:16,320
at this point when did he buy this game because you know nowadays you can get

3509
01:54:16,320 --> 01:54:22,480
this game and all the expansions for like 20 bucks I mean and really is $20

3510
01:54:22,480 --> 01:54:26,440
worth you know suing over I don't know and so if you will sue about anything

3511
01:54:26,440 --> 01:54:31,000
and if you didn't make your payments well who's fault is that stupid I

3512
01:54:31,000 --> 01:54:35,440
actually whether or not you purchased the game it's sort of like when you

3513
01:54:35,440 --> 01:54:38,960
keep in mind I work in the mortgage industry it's like when you go buy your

3514
01:54:38,960 --> 01:54:43,440
house you know you can pick out your house and you can make all the

3515
01:54:43,440 --> 01:54:46,400
arrangements to purchase that house but you have to sign the agreement to

3516
01:54:46,400 --> 01:54:50,360
actually be able to live in your house you know and in your agreement it says

3517
01:54:50,360 --> 01:54:54,840
that you are paying for this this and this that your lender has the right to

3518
01:54:54,840 --> 01:54:57,120
church this isn't this if you don't do shit

3519
01:54:57,120 --> 01:55:01,240
guess what same way in that type of contract you have to read it

3520
01:55:01,240 --> 01:55:04,760
this person has no right to sue she's completely responsible for her own and

3521
01:55:04,760 --> 01:55:08,920
and they they even ask you when you're signing up did you know be sure to read

3522
01:55:08,920 --> 01:55:14,760
this contract do you accept these terms and you know whatever it's not their

3523
01:55:14,760 --> 01:55:17,320
fault she didn't read it well this is what I don't understand I played this

3524
01:55:17,320 --> 01:55:23,040
game for three years I had when I never heard of them charging interest not a

3525
01:55:23,040 --> 01:55:27,320
single person in my league shall ever talked about this if it is really late

3526
01:55:27,320 --> 01:55:33,040
payments I guess but if you pay late there's no paying late you pay a lot of

3527
01:55:33,040 --> 01:55:37,520
pay disable your account you want to pay right and if your credit card bounces or

3528
01:55:37,520 --> 01:55:43,640
whatever you can log in yeah but like I don't know do they charge you before the

3529
01:55:43,640 --> 01:55:47,360
new month is up say like I pay for a month or whatever like that they charge

3530
01:55:47,360 --> 01:55:49,480
in the beginning of the other month because if they charge me at the end of

3531
01:55:49,480 --> 01:55:52,560
the month then you know you've paid for that month and you have you owe the

3532
01:55:52,560 --> 01:55:56,240
money I guess for that I think the beginning of the month makes sense I

3533
01:55:56,240 --> 01:56:00,880
don't understand I think we need to hear more about what's the way it's worded it

3534
01:56:00,880 --> 01:56:04,880
makes it sound like a dummy and on top of all that five million dollars really

3535
01:56:04,880 --> 01:56:09,280
for something that sounds like that they just fucked up and didn't pay their bill

3536
01:56:09,280 --> 01:56:15,960
customer service could just resolved well maybe that's the problem but you

3537
01:56:15,960 --> 01:56:19,440
know I don't know yeah five million dollars a little extreme but I mean if

3538
01:56:19,440 --> 01:56:23,460
it's being split among a hundred thousand people is class action right so

3539
01:56:23,460 --> 01:56:26,340
technically all hundred thousand should be entitled to their chunk of it so they

3540
01:56:26,340 --> 01:56:31,560
all get what 50 bucks a pop 5,000 is that much I can't do math sorry yeah

3541
01:56:31,560 --> 01:56:36,440
but still well wait I think it's still 50 times a hundred thousand I think it's

3542
01:56:36,440 --> 01:56:41,640
still highly frivolous well it's still a 50 bucks that's you know and they're not

3543
01:56:41,640 --> 01:56:48,240
gonna get $50 either because lawyers got to get paid I've let's see going in chat

3544
01:56:48,240 --> 01:56:53,220
for our comments chat that orange entree calm Joshi 16 in chat says people sue

3545
01:56:53,220 --> 01:57:00,840
over $0 GS 68 says people make patents sit on them then sue GS 68 is saying he's

3546
01:57:00,840 --> 01:57:04,260
gonna patent eighth-generation game consoles then get ready to sue Sony

3547
01:57:04,260 --> 01:57:09,760
Microsoft and Nintendo so we'll see how that works out for you how about the

3548
01:57:09,760 --> 01:57:13,400
mailbag I think it's time we get to some emails you haven't even have an email

3549
01:57:13,400 --> 01:57:16,680
bag yet all right we do one more story then we get to the meal yeah I'm pulling

3550
01:57:16,680 --> 01:57:20,000
it now look you got another story for us in the meantime yes apparently there's

3551
01:57:20,000 --> 01:57:24,200
an off-broadway play that's been inspired by adventure games apparently

3552
01:57:24,200 --> 01:57:30,720
it's a how off-broadway pretty off-broadway I guess it's called

3553
01:57:30,720 --> 01:57:35,460
adventure quest and explores the convention set by Sierra's adventure

3554
01:57:35,460 --> 01:57:40,040
games back in time of well the 90s I guess how is that different from like

3555
01:57:40,040 --> 01:57:46,600
just a fairy tale I don't know it's sort of like I guess into the woods they say

3556
01:57:46,600 --> 01:57:52,160
oh yeah I know that play that's that's kind of a spoof on well I guess fairy

3557
01:57:52,160 --> 01:57:56,120
tales actually is what into the woods is about yeah but apparently I guess this

3558
01:57:56,120 --> 01:58:00,000
is currently playing at the brick theater as part of the anti-depressant

3559
01:58:00,000 --> 01:58:04,840
festival and it will be part of their theaters gameplay celebration in which

3560
01:58:04,840 --> 01:58:09,000
they have a they will have a variety of video game related performances

3561
01:58:09,000 --> 01:58:14,000
including let's take a look here this has got to be one of those theaters

3562
01:58:14,000 --> 01:58:18,640
that's like only seats 20 people in it you know like it's a real tiny tiny

3563
01:58:18,640 --> 01:58:23,240
community theater I can't imagine this is a big production they're gonna have

3564
01:58:23,240 --> 01:58:28,200
yes the gameplay celebration is apparently three performances executed

3565
01:58:28,200 --> 01:58:32,560
through video games in video game styles three video game or three game party

3566
01:58:32,560 --> 01:58:38,240
nights and three weeks of rot your brain video game madness and apparently their

3567
01:58:38,240 --> 01:58:43,400
video game party nights include an MMORPG night where you will play your

3568
01:58:43,400 --> 01:58:49,200
favorite massively multiplayer online role-playing game in theater rock band

3569
01:58:49,200 --> 01:58:54,280
karaoke and then another night will be a chiptunes dance party that sounds fun

3570
01:58:54,280 --> 01:58:58,800
but this sounds so off-broadway it's like in New Jersey what's kind of neat

3571
01:58:58,800 --> 01:59:04,440
though is like what they have like it's live actors on stage with like no set

3572
01:59:04,440 --> 01:59:08,960
work and then the sets are actually like artwork from like adventure games which

3573
01:59:08,960 --> 01:59:14,600
is kind of neat okay that's kind of neat I guess what a bunch of nerds but I can

3574
01:59:14,600 --> 01:59:17,840
applaud where I want to talk and they actually it's kind of cool they've got

3575
01:59:17,840 --> 01:59:24,320
like a little score tally running and nice all right we ready for some emails

3576
01:59:24,320 --> 01:59:28,000
yeah all right whenever you want to interact with the show mailbag at

3577
01:59:28,000 --> 01:59:31,600
orangeslaunasrated.com is a great place to do it we jump in there and read some

3580
01:59:38,560 --> 01:59:42,680
Rob mailbag at orangeslaunasrated.com

3581
01:59:46,920 --> 01:59:52,120
first email I just listened to last week's show and I would compare it more

3582
01:59:52,120 --> 01:59:55,560
to doom and the start of the first-person shooter genres about being

3583
01:59:55,560 --> 02:00:00,480
a BB&A versus DJ hero when a new when a new game genre first appears to the

3584
02:00:00,480 --> 02:00:04,400
general public it seems like the best way to classify is by calling it a clone

3585
02:00:04,400 --> 02:00:09,120
of the first most popular game in the genre for more recent example look at

3586
02:00:09,120 --> 02:00:13,920
how sandbox games were called GTA clones until a few years ago and that's from

3587
02:00:13,920 --> 02:00:19,480
Corky842 who also sends an addendum ps the last email was brought to you by

3588
02:00:19,480 --> 02:00:27,120
beer in the palm pre Wow I don't know if I have a lot else to add to that that's

3589
02:00:27,120 --> 02:00:30,840
an interesting comparison I didn't even think of the doom like the whole like

3590
02:00:30,840 --> 02:00:34,760
doom quake Wolfenstein type of connection last week but very interesting

3591
02:00:34,760 --> 02:00:47,680
point um cheeseburger says I miss MJ dude you're too young this one says hey

3592
02:00:47,680 --> 02:00:53,080
y'all I downloaded the new iPod touch firmware tonight first of all I paid 10

3593
02:00:53,080 --> 02:00:58,760
bucks for this why is this really good or am I an apple lemming or both the

3594
02:00:58,760 --> 02:01:02,160
second this update actually looks interesting the copy and paste is not

3595
02:01:02,160 --> 02:01:07,000
really what I'm used to but what was I expecting parental controls are good if

3596
02:01:07,000 --> 02:01:12,240
you're a parent as I am NOT it's useless to me the shake to shuffle feature is

3597
02:01:12,240 --> 02:01:18,920
nice though and really useful when my baby's crying album kicks in well that

3598
02:01:18,920 --> 02:01:26,120
that's awesome for Apple to charge for firmware updates I didn't pay for mine

3599
02:01:26,120 --> 02:01:30,840
you don't pay on the phones you only pay on the I touch or whatever oh well how

3600
02:01:30,840 --> 02:01:36,840
generous of them I know I don't care I have the phone yes third assuming you

3601
02:01:36,840 --> 02:01:41,040
didn't cut me off with the baby comment they've done something to improve typing

3602
02:01:41,040 --> 02:01:45,320
messages and I love them for it landscape typing makes the buttons

3603
02:01:45,320 --> 02:01:49,000
noticeably bigger and improvement that helps me a lot now I don't miss type

3604
02:01:49,000 --> 02:01:52,400
every other word yay well that's all for now

3605
02:01:52,400 --> 02:01:59,000
steak hair entertainment this message was typed an iPod touch which I have and

3606
02:01:59,000 --> 02:02:04,320
you don't ask yeah I have an iPhone actually I do really like the the

3607
02:02:04,320 --> 02:02:12,600
upgrade I like having five panels for my apps instead of the three and I'm pretty

3608
02:02:12,600 --> 02:02:17,120
pleased with it pretty pleased also I really like some of the changes that

3609
02:02:17,120 --> 02:02:21,920
they've made to the it's okay I like that I can text and landscape now that's

3610
02:02:21,920 --> 02:02:25,960
the biggest new improvement same with email but I'm not liking the fact that

3611
02:02:25,960 --> 02:02:29,240
the phone just seems to run slower like I guess with all that stuff in there

3612
02:02:29,240 --> 02:02:32,880
like a lot of my apps feel like they're running slower but I'm hoping that'll

3613
02:02:32,880 --> 02:02:38,160
get showing an improvement I'm hoping that with the 3.1 that's inevitable at

3614
02:02:38,160 --> 02:02:42,320
some point you know the minor tweaks that'll fix that all up that's what I

3615
02:02:42,320 --> 02:02:48,560
hope next email sure dear olr crew I just wanted to briefly chime in on

3616
02:02:48,560 --> 02:02:52,880
something you went over last week that being guitar hero Van Halen I remember

3617
02:02:52,880 --> 02:02:57,520
when they announced the game I was actually somewhat interested though that

3618
02:02:57,520 --> 02:03:01,840
interest dropped completely when it said the game was Van Halen and not Van

3619
02:03:01,840 --> 02:03:08,040
Hagar you know what I love Sammy Hagar most the music by them that I love is

3620
02:03:08,040 --> 02:03:11,120
when Sammy Hagar was the lead singer there's only a couple of songs that I

3621
02:03:11,120 --> 02:03:16,480
enjoyed that were when David Lee Roth was singing with the group I completely

3622
02:03:16,480 --> 02:03:21,200
agree with this by the way and so I suppose that in the opinion of many I'm

3623
02:03:21,200 --> 02:03:26,520
not a true fan of the group that is just my own musical taste perhaps now there

3624
02:03:26,520 --> 02:03:30,080
might be an opportunity for rock band to pick up the remaining music I'd freaking

3625
02:03:30,080 --> 02:03:34,880
love to play dreams thanks for reading it's always awesome for PS I just want

3626
02:03:34,880 --> 02:03:38,760
to know that it was very painful news on Thursday June 25th when Michael Jackson

3627
02:03:38,760 --> 02:03:43,020
died may he rest in peace but forever live on through his music and what a

3628
02:03:43,020 --> 02:03:46,420
great tribute that would be if harmonics gave us the real of the thriller album

3629
02:03:46,420 --> 02:03:51,800
is rock band DLC don't count on it now on a wishful thinking I realize

3630
02:03:51,800 --> 02:03:56,320
everybody's still wrapped up you know I don't want to get into this topic but

3631
02:03:56,320 --> 02:03:59,880
everybody's still wrapped up in the Michael Jackson thing don't count on it

3632
02:03:59,880 --> 02:04:03,240
something like that is gonna be years and years in the making because guess

3633
02:04:03,240 --> 02:04:08,160
what to the rights to that stuff now it's all gonna be up in the air with the

3634
02:04:08,160 --> 02:04:12,600
debt that man left behind if rumors are to be believed it these type of

3635
02:04:12,600 --> 02:04:18,360
struggles will go on for years did you see misty sent us clips no I didn't

3636
02:04:18,360 --> 02:04:21,840
misty sent us a bunch of clips I think that you should hop into the mailbag too

3637
02:04:21,840 --> 02:04:27,440
I might oh my gosh Wow I might have to play those during the afterbirth night

3638
02:04:27,440 --> 02:04:36,700
all right okay Thank You misty well I thought he's so rich but his company's

3639
02:04:36,700 --> 02:04:41,400
bankrupt kind of I to be honest I don't know nor do I feel like it's any my

3640
02:04:41,400 --> 02:04:46,000
business I kind of don't care but you know I sound rude but you know it's not

3641
02:04:46,000 --> 02:04:49,360
my finances I got I got my own finances to worry about well we've got two more

3642
02:04:49,360 --> 02:04:54,840
emails hi lol crew this is your friendly neighborhood Mexican act daft first of

3643
02:04:54,840 --> 02:04:58,320
all I want to congratulate you for your seventh anniversary I've been listening

3644
02:04:58,320 --> 02:05:03,000
to the show since 2005 though I became a regular since 2006 around episode 200 I

3645
02:05:03,000 --> 02:05:08,720
wish you the best for the years to come thank you acts daft well now to business

3646
02:05:08,720 --> 02:05:14,480
ooh so serious well we have all seen and heard the news on the newest DDR and the

3647
02:05:14,480 --> 02:05:19,260
latest Bemani news and how disappointing it has been how DDR has burned to the

3648
02:05:19,260 --> 02:05:22,680
ground and possibly lost its appeal to the true old fans of the series and

3649
02:05:22,680 --> 02:05:27,400
localization of pop music in the States which is a joke for those who know about

3650
02:05:27,400 --> 02:05:31,920
the game well call me crazy and stuff but now I'm glad Konami didn't bring

3651
02:05:31,920 --> 02:05:36,080
guitar freaks in germania stateside that way we got guitar hero and rock band

3652
02:05:36,080 --> 02:05:39,800
which are truly great and haven't lost their appeal to the public no matter how

3653
02:05:39,800 --> 02:05:43,640
much activision is milking guitar hero though they did bring guitar freaks

3654
02:05:43,640 --> 02:05:49,240
germania to this you know side of the pond I guess in the arcades yes in the

3655
02:05:49,240 --> 02:05:55,200
arcades but also as rock revolution unfortunately that doesn't count I still

3656
02:05:55,200 --> 02:05:58,160
look at because no one cared about that anyway I still wondered what would have

3657
02:05:58,160 --> 02:06:03,880
happened if konami would konami bro guitar Dora but considering how rock

3658
02:06:03,880 --> 02:06:08,080
revolution did see there we go I'm glad they didn't granted it wouldn't have

3659
02:06:08,080 --> 02:06:12,400
been the same game but still look at the way DDR and pop music are going not good

3660
02:06:12,400 --> 02:06:16,360
at all and a guitar freaks germania would have taken the same route and

3661
02:06:16,360 --> 02:06:20,740
doomed the rhythm games for years to come so thank you konami for not giving

3662
02:06:20,740 --> 02:06:24,980
us guitar freaks in germania rock revolution proved what it what it would

3663
02:06:24,980 --> 02:06:28,960
have happened to guitar over the years now don't screw up and don't release

3664
02:06:28,960 --> 02:06:33,760
another bad part of beat mania because of scratch and DJ hero heck forget about

3665
02:06:33,760 --> 02:06:38,360
the money in the States and let k set jay do their thing at least they know if

3666
02:06:38,360 --> 02:06:43,800
the record breaks don't try to fix it thanks thanks for reading this email

3667
02:06:43,800 --> 02:06:47,560
again congrats on the seven years entertaining the internet every Sunday

3668
02:06:47,560 --> 02:06:52,080
PS adjacent Enos were dead he'd be rolling in his grave right now well he's

3669
02:06:52,080 --> 02:06:57,720
not he's alive and well he's um he's at EA now I think I can say that he's moved

3670
02:06:57,720 --> 02:07:04,200
on to a better place yes um look I I don't know if I agree very much with the

3671
02:07:04,200 --> 02:07:09,480
whole rock revolution is what guitar freaks would have become like although I

3672
02:07:09,480 --> 02:07:13,120
can totally see the point about maybe if this game had come out first it would

3673
02:07:13,120 --> 02:07:16,840
have hurt the chances for things in the future I can sort of kind of go with

3674
02:07:16,840 --> 02:07:20,600
that I guess but I don't think that rock revolution would have happened if it

3675
02:07:20,600 --> 02:07:24,480
weren't for guitar freaks I think I don't think rock revolution honestly

3676
02:07:24,480 --> 02:07:29,040
outside of music alone I don't think it had anything to do with guitar freaks at

3677
02:07:29,040 --> 02:07:35,000
all rock revolution was an attempt to make a copy of guitar hero and use the

3678
02:07:35,000 --> 02:07:38,920
Bahmani brand to do it knowing that they wouldn't be able to say anything about

3679
02:07:38,920 --> 02:07:42,200
it because Konami did have guitar freaks they did have the Bahmani

3680
02:07:42,200 --> 02:07:49,400
thing and just that they just just piss poor execution stop being lazy and

3681
02:07:49,400 --> 02:07:53,040
hopefully you know they're learning their lesson when it's this is this game

3682
02:07:53,040 --> 02:07:57,800
is an embarrassment rock revolution was there's really no nice way for me to say

3683
02:07:57,800 --> 02:08:02,160
it with as much nice things as you know Konami has put out in the past and

3684
02:08:02,160 --> 02:08:06,200
people that I even know there and so on there is no nice way for me to say it

3685
02:08:06,200 --> 02:08:11,880
rock revolution was an embarrassment to that company and it should never happen

3686
02:08:11,880 --> 02:08:18,040
again anyhow any more emails oh yes we did

3687
02:08:18,040 --> 02:08:24,680
last one hey Rob Jamie and Matt this is longtime listener SSJ 100 Matt I first

3688

wanted to congratulate and praise you on your seventh anniversary it's amazing

3689
02:08:29,640 --> 02:08:33,800
that it was a little less than six years ago that I first started listening to

3690
02:08:33,800 --> 02:08:38,000
the show I first discovered OLR through a friend who recommended the now long

3691
02:08:38,000 --> 02:08:42,000
defunct Wednesday show outside the box from there I discovered the Sunday show

3692
02:08:42,000 --> 02:08:46,120
and the rest was history I know you guys get enough praise as it is and for the

3693
02:08:46,120 --> 02:08:50,400
sake of this email I will keep it short no I like praise keep keep it I like

3694
02:08:50,400 --> 02:08:54,800
that somebody remembers outside the box I barely remember that show that's crazy

3695
02:08:54,800 --> 02:08:58,680
I was a sideshow I hosted years ago with some friends and you three have

3696
02:08:58,680 --> 02:09:02,000
sacrificed seven years of your Sunday nights for the sake of us the listener

3697
02:09:02,000 --> 02:09:06,160
and have never asked for anything in return we the listeners can never make

3698
02:09:06,160 --> 02:09:10,000
that amount of dedication up to you except to continue to listen tell to

3699

3706
02:09:39,000 --> 02:09:42,880
these parties I was wondering if you had any ideas or recommendations for great

3707
02:09:42,880 --> 02:09:46,200
party games that we may want to try playing as it stands now we have Gears

3708

02:14:32,240 --> 02:14:35,840
flashback where we are 100 episodes behind right now so you can hear what

3767
02:14:35,840 --> 02:14:40,720
the show sounded like two years ago it's pretty nuts I kind of looked at the chat

3768
02:14:40,720 --> 02:14:44,320
and some of the response to last week's episode and I think I think Missy or

3769
02:14:44,320 --> 02:14:47,640
somebody had said it's a good thing I wasn't there because I would have ripped

3770
02:14:47,640 --> 02:14:52,280
them a new asshole so so here what offensive things you missed out on on

3771
02:14:52,280 --> 02:14:56,160
back on episodes 20 and 21 and all that stuff we're playing way back when so

3772
02:14:56,160 --> 02:15:00,040
check it out it was on our old old station we used to play shows that were

3773
02:15:00,040 --> 02:15:04,600
like three years old and I don't even know like a we lost a ton of shows when

3774
02:15:04,600 --> 02:15:08,600
one of our hard drives went out so it's which is a bummer they might still be

3775
02:15:08,600 --> 02:15:11,560
around you know who added me on Twitter the other day was DDR angel and if

3776
02:15:11,560 --> 02:15:15,200
anybody has older well our episodes between her and misty we could probably

3777
02:15:15,200 --> 02:15:22,240
find them all anyway alright so anyhow yay clip fun let's do a few more stories

3778
02:15:22,240 --> 02:15:25,520
than I guess we'll go to Skype at some point here we've done all the other

3779
02:15:25,520 --> 02:15:29,040
segments we need to do tonight right we did if used in mailbag really states

02:15:33,160 --> 02:15:39,400
our soccer um yeah okay so look you have a few more forms yes apparently there is

3782
02:15:39,400 --> 02:15:45,760
a brand new game entering the wrestling game genre and this is being put out by

3783
02:15:45,760 --> 02:15:53,120
immersion software on the Wii PSP and DS I'm sorry that's by a different

3784
02:15:53,120 --> 02:15:58,480
Argentine developer as Sabasa studios but anyways immersion software they're

3787
02:16:12,040 --> 02:16:18,880
the video game and it's got all sorts of lucha libre stars including on the

3788
02:16:18,880 --> 02:16:29,800

the also the Santos line of videos you know it's a Mexican wrestler who's like

3796
02:17:18,000 --> 02:17:23,480
solving mysteries and stuff like that I mean that's just cheesy and weird you

3797
02:17:23,480 --> 02:17:26,400
know what you want to know a Mexican wrestler that was badass did you ever

3798
02:17:26,400 --> 02:17:31,440
play Saturday Night Slam Masters no there was a wrestler in that game and I

3799
02:17:31,440 --> 02:17:35,440
can't remember his name he was the guy they had this game at my local pizza

3800
02:17:35,440 --> 02:17:42,960
parlor and oh my god it was so much fun yeah we used to play that a lot what was

3801
02:17:42,960 --> 02:17:46,280
the name of that guy I'm trying to look it up on Wikipedia right now El sting

3802
02:17:46,280 --> 02:17:53,280
ray I was his name good times one of the guys from final fight was in the game

3803
02:17:53,280 --> 02:17:59,680
the mayor of Hagar yeah Hagar was in Saturday Night Slam Masters good times

3804
02:17:59,680 --> 02:18:04,920
so we got a couple more stories we ready to open up skype line what we doing

3805
02:18:04,920 --> 02:18:09,800
Skype it well Skype it were there any of the big stories we haven't got to yet

3806
02:18:09,800 --> 02:18:13,960
Loki or do you think we got it all code who's coming out next week at some point

3807
02:18:13,960 --> 02:18:19,040
that's at a game making software that's going to be available on Xbox community

3808
02:18:19,040 --> 02:18:23,120
or indie games whatever it's called at the moment really for 400 Microsoft

3809
02:18:23,120 --> 02:18:27,320
points five bucks hell yes I will be picking that up that's supposed to be

3810
02:18:27,320 --> 02:18:29,840
coming out sometime around June 30th they're actually going through the same

3811
02:18:29,840 --> 02:18:34,680
peer review process as every other developer has to go through so they're

3812
02:18:34,680 --> 02:18:39,680
targeting it for some time June 30th ish you know might not be exactly June 30th

3813
02:18:39,680 --> 02:18:46,960
but that's kind of cool very cool let me cover a couple quick stories here real

3814
02:18:46,960 --> 02:18:50,680
quick before we go to the Skype line let's see our con is coming to the

3815
02:18:50,680 --> 02:18:53,880
iPhone which makes me very happy because I remember this game for the Commodore

3816
02:18:53,880 --> 02:18:57,640
64 I think it actually did just come out because my friend was showing me that he

3817
02:18:57,640 --> 02:19:03,320
bought it the other day it is out for $4 for the iPhone and the iPod touch and

3818
02:19:03,320 --> 02:19:08,280
that is available no multiplayer sadly but you can download this and play it on

3819
02:19:08,280 --> 02:19:13,120
the iPhone I'm wondering how smoothly it runs but yeah oh god I'd love to our con

3820
02:19:13,120 --> 02:19:15,700
I know I've talked about on the show before it was like it was like chess but

3821
02:19:15,700 --> 02:19:19,840
the pieces would actually battle each other but not like regular chess you had

3822
02:19:19,840 --> 02:19:24,480
different types of pieces like basilisks and unicorns and shape shifters and all

3823
02:19:24,480 --> 02:19:28,960
this cool stuff well I've got a few more stories here real quick sure there's a

3824
02:19:28,960 --> 02:19:32,280
rumor that one versus 100 is coming out of beta next week and we'll actually be

3825
02:19:32,280 --> 02:19:39,840
giving prizes so that'd be cool ah I bet that's not true I think there's gonna be

3826
02:19:39,840 --> 02:19:43,360
more of a build-up to it than just oh hey next week prizes I think they'll be

3827
02:19:43,360 --> 02:19:47,440
more of a build-up I know I heard that the guy supposedly said something

3828
02:19:47,440 --> 02:19:52,000
whatever it doesn't mean anything bit trip core is gonna be coming out in two

3829
02:19:52,000 --> 02:19:57,280
weeks and they'll be the 100th we wear game on the service that's kind of neat

3830
02:19:57,280 --> 02:20:00,720
bit trip beat was kind of cool I'm wondering how this is gonna be different

3831
02:20:00,720 --> 02:20:03,920
I said are they changing anything it's a totally different type of game

3832
02:20:03,920 --> 02:20:10,440
interesting yeah okay and of course I'm sure you saw this already

3833
02:20:10,440 --> 02:20:16,700
Namco networks is giving burger time an update with burger time deluxe yes I

3834
02:20:16,700 --> 02:20:21,080
heard about this I've heard a lot of people call it crap but burger time was

3835
02:20:21,080 --> 02:20:25,000
an awesome game in the 80s but you know even I can admit it's probably one of

3836
02:20:25,000 --> 02:20:30,320
those things that's better left in the 80s but I will check this out but it

3837
02:20:30,320 --> 02:20:33,880
just looks like the old game was souped up graphics in new stages which you know

3838
02:20:33,880 --> 02:20:37,280
it's not like the stages are that complicated yeah it's probably and then

3839
02:20:37,280 --> 02:20:40,160
finally last thing oh actually got two things

3840
02:20:40,160 --> 02:20:45,040
Bethesda their parent company bought ID software so now that's kind of under the

3841
02:20:45,040 --> 02:20:50,040
whole ZeniMax I guess was the company that owns Bethesda now they own it's

3842
02:20:50,040 --> 02:20:57,840
software as well and apparently the next two games rage and Wolfenstein obviously

3843
02:20:57,840 --> 02:21:02,320
are gonna be published under their respective publishers EA and Activision

3844
02:21:02,320 --> 02:21:06,840
but now all the further games are being published under probably like Bethesda

3845
02:21:06,840 --> 02:21:10,760
or something like that I don't know ZeniMax unless ZeniMax has come out as a

3846
02:21:10,760 --> 02:21:17,160
new publisher I guess apparently if you were a subscriber to EGM and since EGM

3847
02:21:17,160 --> 02:21:21,720
is kind of gone right now your subscriptions were converted into Maxim

3848
02:21:21,720 --> 02:21:26,880
subscriptions which I think is a fair trade if you ask me so that's kind of

3849
02:21:26,880 --> 02:21:32,840
neat and then still yet another survey suggesting that Netflix streaming is

3850
02:21:32,840 --> 02:21:36,880
coming to the Wii the only difference we get this damn survey like every six

3851
02:21:36,880 --> 02:21:40,920
months the only difference now is instead of a one-time fee of $9.99 it

3852
02:21:40,920 --> 02:21:46,000
will be free so you will not have to purchase a streaming disc but hey if it

3853
02:21:46,000 --> 02:21:50,160
happens it happens cool and then finally Ubisoft that would make the Wii a little

3854
02:21:50,160 --> 02:21:53,760
more lucrative than 360 because you wouldn't have to have gold very true

3855
02:21:53,760 --> 02:21:58,520
that that's a that's a big feather in Wii's cap don't underestimate that

3856
02:21:58,520 --> 02:22:04,200
don't underestimate that can't do HD streaming though for most you know what

3857
02:22:04,200 --> 02:22:08,520
considering the type of stuff that's there and I'm just gonna say don't

3858
02:22:08,520 --> 02:22:12,920
underestimate that I'm very critical of the Wii on this show but that could be

3859
02:22:12,920 --> 02:22:16,520
big free Netflix essentially if you already have a Netflix account Rob how

3860
02:22:16,520 --> 02:22:20,520
long does it take for the internet browser to load up and you know the Wii

3861
02:22:20,520 --> 02:22:23,720
I mean what if they can if you'll whip it if they can figure out the

3862
02:22:23,720 --> 02:22:26,880
connectivity that makes you know games like Super Smash Brothers and stuff work

3863
02:22:26,880 --> 02:22:32,840
for like kids programming and non HD type stuff again don't underestimate it

3864
02:22:32,840 --> 02:22:36,920
Matt all right big and then finally a Ubisoft's collaboration with Q

3865
02:22:36,920 --> 02:22:42,400
Entertainment they are like it's likely to be a music game but me really when

3866
02:22:42,400 --> 02:22:47,280
you look at odds Q entertain exactly I mean unless it's 99 nights to which is

3867
02:22:47,280 --> 02:22:51,200
somehow doubt no all right look our skype lines already ringing off the

3868
02:22:51,200 --> 02:22:54,080
hook and I really want to get to that very soon but one other quick story for

3869
02:22:54,080 --> 02:22:58,200
you guys if I could Marvel vs. Capcom 2 big rumors out there that the game was

3870
02:22:58,200 --> 02:23:03,680
coming out June 29th not true per the Twitter's official Capcom Twitter is not

3871
02:23:03,680 --> 02:23:06,640
coming out June 29th they don't know where the rumor came from well let me

3872
02:23:06,640 --> 02:23:09,880
tell you it was from Marvel's financial reports you might want to look at that

3873
02:23:09,880 --> 02:23:12,880
but they're saying now it's closer to the end of July that the game will

3874
02:23:12,880 --> 02:23:16,680
actually come out so sorry if you guys were looking forward to that one but

3875
02:23:16,680 --> 02:23:19,440
it's not coming out that makes sense so because I think wasn't it part of the

3876
02:23:19,440 --> 02:23:22,520
summer of arcade or something like that and that doesn't start until like the

3877
02:23:22,520 --> 02:23:26,360
end of July anyways yeah I don't know all right look our phone is ringing off

3878
02:23:26,360 --> 02:23:29,480
the hook let's get let's get some calls done tonight hi you're on orange on

3879
02:23:29,480 --> 02:23:33,360
this radio who's this saying that it calls it almost every single week from

3880
02:23:33,360 --> 02:23:36,200
the East Coast I don't know how you get through every time but I'll tell you

3881
02:23:36,200 --> 02:23:39,640
what I've seen like seven different names pop up in the corners so you're

3882
02:23:39,640 --> 02:23:44,320
lucky tonight what's on your mind that much at first I want to say happy

3883
02:23:44,320 --> 02:23:49,000
anniversary to you guys happy birthday congratulations thank you we're seven so

3884
02:23:49,000 --> 02:23:52,920
we should be having this anniversary show at Chuck E Cheese yes but you're

3885
02:23:52,920 --> 02:23:57,720
still immature as a seven-year-old should be mm-hmm what's on your mind

3886
02:23:57,720 --> 02:24:05,040
tonight buddy I have a question about e3 um before you guys went you have made a

3887
02:24:05,040 --> 02:24:09,640
statement about how you felt III wasn't going to be the same yeah like different

3888
02:24:09,640 --> 02:24:15,800
feelings intake about about before you went did you feel the same way when you

3889
02:24:15,800 --> 02:24:20,520
went or what are you talking about the show itself or what I was kind of

3890
02:24:20,520 --> 02:24:24,280
lamenting about that nobody I knew was really going so it was going to be a

3891
02:24:24,280 --> 02:24:28,160
little weird this year a little bit of column a and a little bit of column B

3892
02:24:28,160 --> 02:24:33,880
the show itself I actually think was better it was better than most of the

3893
02:24:33,880 --> 02:24:38,040
prior years because I felt like I actually got time to play games the

3894
02:24:38,040 --> 02:24:43,160
lines were obscenely long I think whatever they did to kind of and I don't

3895
02:24:43,160 --> 02:24:46,960
know this might be in part because the economy but I think whatever they did to

3896
02:24:46,960 --> 02:24:50,080
kind of filter out some of the people that didn't really need to be there and

3897
02:24:50,080 --> 02:24:53,800
someone might argue maybe I don't need to be there but I would argue right back

3898
02:24:53,800 --> 02:24:58,680
mofo but I would say whatever they did to kind of scale back attendance by you

3899
02:24:58,680 --> 02:25:03,360
know whatever they did from 2006 was a good thing I think the show itself was

3900
02:25:03,360 --> 02:25:07,680
good I do want to see them reopen Kensha Hall at some point get some more

3901
02:25:07,680 --> 02:25:12,880
exhibitors out there on the main floor and again the stuff all that stuff is

3902
02:25:12,880 --> 02:25:16,400
behind closed doors kind of bugs me sometimes but whatever it's just

3903
02:25:16,400 --> 02:25:18,680
something we're gonna have to deal with I think overall the show itself was

3904
02:25:18,680 --> 02:25:23,800
better as far as the whole me lamenting about my friends not going and all that

3905
02:25:23,800 --> 02:25:27,920
stuff I think a lot of that got better I got to go to a pretty bitchin party on

3906
02:25:27,920 --> 02:25:32,840
Wednesday night that was hosted by games for windows for part of their windows

3907
02:25:32,840 --> 02:25:37,480
7 kind of preview thing which was actually pretty cool and I got to see a

3908
02:25:37,480 --> 02:25:40,200
lot of your faces from around the podcasting community and meet a couple

3909
02:25:40,200 --> 02:25:44,640
new ones that was kind of nice I enjoyed stuff like that the show itself was

3910
02:25:44,640 --> 02:25:48,160
really different without kind of having the friends there I kind of feel like

3911
02:25:48,160 --> 02:25:52,760
from a business angle I got more done I didn't collect as much stuff I felt like

3912
02:25:52,760 --> 02:25:56,560
I actually played more games but in again I also kind of contribute that to

3913
02:25:56,560 --> 02:26:01,080
the crowd I don't know I you know it's kind of cool the one day Loki was there

3914
02:26:01,080 --> 02:26:06,720
we got to go around at night at least I had my boyfriend there that I kind of

3915
02:26:06,720 --> 02:26:10,240
got to see at night so it didn't end up being so bad in that regard I think I

3916
02:26:10,240 --> 02:26:13,880
would have had even more fun and I would be like more excited and woo and I would

3917
02:26:13,880 --> 02:26:16,960
have gone all three days keep that in mind is that's a big thing too I didn't

3918
02:26:16,960 --> 02:26:20,560
go all three days this year oh okay I only went two days and I feel like that

3919
02:26:20,560 --> 02:26:24,840
was sufficient I got to see everything I wanted to see I was happy with it and I

3920
02:26:24,840 --> 02:26:27,240
know there's so many people out there that are probably yelling at me right

3921
02:26:27,240 --> 02:26:31,080
right now like you ungrateful bastard I would give my left nut to go to e3 and

3922
02:26:31,080 --> 02:26:34,680
you're just talking to your poo-pooing it down but trust me guys it's it is a

3923
02:26:34,680 --> 02:26:41,780
very exhausting experience it's it's a lot so if you want to go to e3 but you

3924
02:26:41,780 --> 02:26:45,920
can't just go to PAX because and Bobby's made this comparison before and I think

3925
02:26:45,920 --> 02:26:54,040
he's absolutely right PAX is probably what you think e3 is so go to PAX I'll

3926
02:26:54,040 --> 02:26:58,120
be there PAX East Coast PAX that is I want to be at East Coast PAX I'm trying

3927
02:26:58,120 --> 02:27:02,360
but I gotta make West Coast PAX work too and I'll skip West Coast PAX to come to

3928
02:27:02,360 --> 02:27:09,680
East Coast PAX come on I can show you all doing both I just heard that they

3929
02:27:09,680 --> 02:27:13,960

3930
02:27:13,960 --> 02:27:18,320

go to Boston for PAX East well yeah it's close enough for us yeah well stop by

3932
02:27:23,640 --> 02:27:28,120
four and a half hours Loki you know what another flight connect a jerky when I

3933
02:27:28,120 --> 02:27:32,080
talk to people on the East Coast you know how many times I'm asked so if I

3934
02:27:32,080 --> 02:27:37,640
fly into LA I can drive up and visit you in Sacramento right not very easy well

3935
02:27:37,640 --> 02:27:40,920
I'm just saying you know you can take a cheap flight to New York and then you

3936
02:27:40,920 --> 02:27:47,440
know fly you connect to you know Boston I guess take a train or train there you

3937
02:27:47,440 --> 02:27:51,760
know it's not really all that far to Boston besides I want to fly jet blue to

3938
02:27:51,760 --> 02:27:55,200
New York City I'm sorry if we're given the option between Southwest or jet blue

3939
02:27:55,200 --> 02:28:00,120
jet blue and I've heard lots of amazing things about Virgin Air that's the

3940
02:28:00,120 --> 02:28:03,640
airline I want to try at some point yeah a lot of my friends fly Virginia they

3941
02:28:03,640 --> 02:28:07,280

did you call in about anything else tonight besides just the pack Tom to be

3978
02:30:53,320 --> 02:30:57,280
honest to be honest I I really I normally wouldn't call in without a

3979
02:30:57,280 --> 02:31:00,480
subject but it was the seventh anniversary and I'm a frequent listener

3980
02:31:00,480 --> 02:31:04,480
so I feel like I'm not trying to like make myself sound cool I just said I

3981
02:31:04,480 --> 02:31:07,680
would want to call and see how I didn't leave a voicemail I don't really have

3982
02:31:07,680 --> 02:31:12,520
much of a topic and I don't really want to get into that deep stuff again I know

3983
02:31:12,520 --> 02:31:16,480
this is more of a gaming podcast but I just want to let you know I really do

3984
02:31:16,480 --> 02:31:21,000
appreciate you going into the current news sometimes because really I listen

3985
02:31:21,000 --> 02:31:25,440

3986
02:31:25,440 --> 02:31:28,280
gaming news and that you're not afraid to just have fun sometimes but I just

3987

3993
02:31:53,840 --> 02:31:56,840
going back to the phones hi you're on orange launch radio who's this it's GS

3994
02:31:56,840 --> 02:32:01,240
68 hi what's on your mind buddy I came back from the Philippines I wanted to

3995
02:32:01,240 --> 02:32:05,200
share my arcade side of the things you came back from where I'm sorry the

3996
02:32:05,200 --> 02:32:08,640
Philippines oh the Philippines that's right I think I saw something on your

3997
02:32:08,640 --> 02:32:12,120
Facebook about you were going out there oh yeah believe it or not I actually

3998
02:32:12,120 --> 02:32:15,920
read the status updates on Facebook and Twitter and all that stuff ice how was

3999
02:32:15,920 --> 02:32:21,800
it it was yes all right though like the our case there was good as last time

4000
02:32:21,800 --> 02:32:26,200
maybe that's good as I remembered well you know what it's because the arcades

4001
02:32:26,200 --> 02:32:30,480
over here probably aren't as good as you remember either look that he still have

4002
02:32:30,480 --> 02:32:37,320
some games that I haven't seen on this side of the Pacific Rim years like life

4003
02:32:37,320 --> 02:32:44,360
for example Mario Kart arcade GP with card slots but but really surprised me

4004
02:32:44,360 --> 02:32:51,720
when I was there was house it at that ex hmm how was that basically it's it's just

4005
02:32:51,720 --> 02:32:55,960
bit of a house of death but like they drew it in a cartoony style and you

4006
02:32:55,960 --> 02:33:00,200
probably won't believe I'm about to say but basically the storyline of the game

4007
02:33:00,200 --> 02:33:04,680
it's a zombie romance like that sounds awesome

4008
02:33:04,680 --> 02:33:08,560
zombie romance movie now that's a movie that we need who wouldn't go see that

4009
02:33:08,560 --> 02:33:15,840
about this zombie girl who falls in love with her with her prison guard or

4010
02:33:15,840 --> 02:33:21,480
whatever and they escape and you have to and it's basically a bunch of minigames

4011
02:33:21,480 --> 02:33:26,120
where you have to do things like catch fruit or shoot the bad teeth off of the

4012
02:33:26,120 --> 02:33:30,800
stage one fossil positive or better I thought for a minute there you were

4013
02:33:30,800 --> 02:33:34,240
about to get into lesbian zombie romance because that was the only way this story

4014
02:33:34,240 --> 02:33:36,200
was gonna get even that much better but that's okay

4015
02:33:36,200 --> 02:33:41,480
unfortunately no they can do that in the sequel that's all right it's going

4016
02:33:41,480 --> 02:33:45,880
through perfect and I well as I mentioned it's awesome games that I

4017
02:33:45,880 --> 02:33:52,080
haven't seen in years like f0ax and oh I love f0ax I gotta ask you real quick

4018
02:33:52,080 --> 02:33:54,680
though real quick since we have a lot of time tonight what about music games

4019
02:33:54,680 --> 02:33:57,520
because I know you're big music game fans is there a big presence of games

4020
02:33:57,520 --> 02:34:04,880
the Philippines hello big is there a big presence of music games over in the

4021
02:34:04,880 --> 02:34:14,720
Philippines oh I lost I think we are losing gs68 connection I don't know if

4022
02:34:14,720 --> 02:34:18,880
that's on your end or our end I'm gonna have to let you go I'm sorry I don't

4023
02:34:18,880 --> 02:34:22,200
know what happened with that connection but we'll hope hope maybe he'll call

4024
02:34:22,200 --> 02:34:24,600
back later when the connection is a little better in the meantime let me get

4025
02:34:24,600 --> 02:34:28,160
to another call hi you're on orange launch radio who's this hello hi who's

4026
02:34:28,160 --> 02:34:32,960
this this is leecham six hello leecham six I don't recognize that name are you

4027
02:34:32,960 --> 02:34:37,520
a first-time caller yes I am welcome well welcome what a heck of a night hello

4028
02:34:37,520 --> 02:34:41,440
well what's on your mind buddy yeah yeah I was wondering have you guys I know

4029
02:34:41,440 --> 02:34:46,040
you guys have addressed iPhone gaming and that sort of thing a little bit but

4030
02:34:46,040 --> 02:34:50,480
you know what the new 3.0 update they've you can add new devices to it like

4031
02:34:50,480 --> 02:34:54,760
controllers and stuff mm-hmm have you guys seen that yeah I've seen this one

4032
02:34:54,760 --> 02:34:58,600
it's like a NES controller but it's like a game bone yeah you know we were

4033
02:34:58,600 --> 02:35:01,400
hearing about some of this stuff last week I think there was a story that we

4034
02:35:01,400 --> 02:35:04,280
kind of got into a little bit about like especially about some of the things

4035
02:35:04,280 --> 02:35:07,600
they're gonna be developing for it but I wasn't under the impression that this

4036
02:35:07,600 --> 02:35:11,600
crap was already out you can already get this stuff I don't think so there's one

4037
02:35:11,600 --> 02:35:14,440
in the works though it looks like a SNES controller yeah it's in the works it's

4038
02:35:14,440 --> 02:35:17,360
called the game bone the only thing that sucks about that is it well they had one

4039
02:35:17,360 --> 02:35:20,920
I don't know if you can attach it to the game bone or what but they've got like

4040
02:35:20,920 --> 02:35:25,400
this controller where you can snap it on to the iPhone or iPod touch and then

4041
02:35:25,400 --> 02:35:29,360
they have another one that like you had to have it in like a sort of stand or

4042
02:35:29,360 --> 02:35:32,840
something you have to play it with a controller separately and that seemed

4043
02:35:32,840 --> 02:35:36,640
kind of stupid but the thing about it is they don't really have a standardized

4044
02:35:36,640 --> 02:35:40,000
controller yet so you buy this controller but you have to wait for

4045
02:35:40,000 --> 02:35:45,280
people actually support this controller in their games but I have a question so

4046
02:35:45,280 --> 02:35:49,040
it's a wireless Bluetooth controller right that looks like a NES controller

4047
02:35:49,040 --> 02:35:57,420
doesn't a lot of people already have one it's called a wiimote do that I guess I

4048
02:35:57,420 --> 02:36:00,160
just those do run off bluetooth don't they cuz yes put them up to their

4049
02:36:00,160 --> 02:36:05,240
computers yes so you could in theory use a wiimote or wii classic controller or

4050
02:36:05,240 --> 02:36:10,520
something like that with that if the you know if that's okay with Apple you know

4051
02:36:10,520 --> 02:36:15,560
if they can you know support that or trick right or if they don't need to get

4052
02:36:15,560 --> 02:36:20,080
approved with that if they just support it in yeah whatever game it's coming out

4053
02:36:20,080 --> 02:36:25,040
I would think anything well well here's my question this other thing you're

4054
02:36:25,040 --> 02:36:29,080
talking about that whole device the bone or the game game bone is that an Apple

4055
02:36:29,080 --> 02:36:33,360
official thing or is that now I'm third party come third party interesting so

4056
02:36:33,360 --> 02:36:36,280
that is interesting that that would come out but you would but see Apple so

4057
02:36:36,280 --> 02:36:39,680
locked down with that kind of stuff I'm now here I bet it's just a matter of

4058
02:36:39,680 --> 02:36:43,080
time before someone hacks the phone to read that yeah I'm actually I'm

4059
02:36:43,080 --> 02:36:46,040
surprised that hasn't happened yet I mean the iPhones been out for two or

4060
02:36:46,040 --> 02:36:49,040
three years now and we've had Bluetooth the whole time I'm surprised that hasn't

4061
02:36:49,040 --> 02:36:53,400
happened yet maybe no one sees the point because you know you can't really use a

4062
02:36:53,400 --> 02:36:57,480
Wiimote on the iPhone with such a tiny little screen but I don't see that's

4063
02:36:57,480 --> 02:37:00,400
that's that's the point people are missing I don't want to use motion

4064
02:37:00,400 --> 02:37:03,720
control I just want to use as a nest controller for my nest emulator and that

4065
02:37:03,720 --> 02:37:07,760
makes sense I I'm kind of surprised that hasn't happened I think it's just

4066
02:37:07,760 --> 02:37:10,960
because sometimes those iPhones are like Fort Knox to get into I mean not that

4067
02:37:10,960 --> 02:37:14,880
that's ever gonna stop the hackers right because how many times do they come out

4068
02:37:14,880 --> 02:37:20,480
and say this is unhackable and then today I never act it just seems kind of

4069
02:37:20,480 --> 02:37:24,560
pointless of me to have a nest emulator where my fingers cover the screen when I

4070
02:37:24,560 --> 02:37:29,760
play well now sir you know those the legality of those nest emulators are a

4071
02:37:29,760 --> 02:37:32,800
little questionable the first place so beggars cannot be choosers my friend

4072
02:37:32,800 --> 02:37:35,960
well obviously I'm using games that are ripped from my cartridges that I bought

4073
02:37:35,960 --> 02:37:41,040
when I was seven of course of course yeah you know I'm sure it's a matter of

4074
02:37:41,040 --> 02:37:46,720
time before the Wiimote thing is hacked but you know I don't know if iPhones

4075
02:37:46,720 --> 02:37:51,040
really that big of a gaming platform for me iPhone is where I game when I'm

4076
02:37:51,040 --> 02:37:54,320
sitting in the doctor's office waiting to be called in that it's you know I

4077
02:37:54,320 --> 02:37:57,680
think I think you addressed that last week actually yeah you're not really a

4078
02:37:57,680 --> 02:38:01,980
portable gamer yeah but that maybe that's just me so all right well hey

4079
02:38:01,980 --> 02:38:04,360
thanks so much for the call any other quick things you want to say before we

4080
02:38:04,360 --> 02:38:08,520
let you go not really just love you guys and congratulations on seven years well

4081
02:38:08,520 --> 02:38:11,560
thank you very much and you picked a hell of a call in you take care of color

4082
02:38:11,560 --> 02:38:16,000
sir later guys that was a very nice phone call by the way there was an

4083
02:38:16,000 --> 02:38:20,600
update on a GS 68 he got cut off unfortunately I wanted to ask him about

4084
02:38:20,600 --> 02:38:25,880
SV GL Sunnyvale Golf Land and if they actually did have DJ max there and

4085
02:38:25,880 --> 02:38:29,600
apparently they do have the final version of DJ max is available now at

4086
02:38:29,600 --> 02:38:33,400
Sunnyvale Golf Land because I'm going to be in the okay I think I would guess in

4087
02:38:33,400 --> 02:38:36,920
July yeah so I want to check that out and he did play some games in the

4088
02:38:36,920 --> 02:38:41,200
Philippines that were music oriented as well so let's go to at least one more

4089
02:38:41,200 --> 02:38:45,080
call here and then we'll show in a moment you think that you think the best

4090
02:38:45,080 --> 02:38:49,680
last call to end this in the night off with and who am I talking about you

4091
02:38:49,680 --> 02:38:55,640
hello legend Zaku what's on your pine nothing much just trying to like trying

4092
02:38:55,640 --> 02:39:01,320
to get through all the grief of what was last week and unfortunately earlier

4093
02:39:01,320 --> 02:39:06,280
today but I guess we got to move on to bigger better things basically I'm

4094
02:39:06,280 --> 02:39:11,400
doing this reason I'm calling today is just to bring up the fact that it and

4095
02:39:11,400 --> 02:39:16,520
Bethesda merged which kind of like you know kind of surprised me because I

4096
02:39:16,520 --> 02:39:20,680
never thought that you know then John Carmack would actually sell out to

4097
02:39:20,680 --> 02:39:24,560
something you know to any particular person aside from EA which he's actually

4098
02:39:24,560 --> 02:39:30,440
working with but not to a company like I don't know like Bethesda the folks from

4099
02:39:30,440 --> 02:39:34,760
fallout and I'm not or Elder Scrolls I'm not saying that they're all bad and all

4100
02:39:34,760 --> 02:39:40,880
but I don't know it's kind of like came out of nowhere um yeah I mean yeah we

4101
02:39:40,880 --> 02:39:43,160
didn't really get into it on the show but I guess that was a pretty big deal

4102
02:39:43,160 --> 02:39:47,160
about you know ID and Bethesda kind of having their marriage going on there but

4103
02:39:47,160 --> 02:39:53,600
um I don't know like maybe I'm just not as big of a first-person shooter fan

4104
02:39:53,600 --> 02:39:57,240
that I've been following ID all this time but I know Bethesda makes some very

4105
02:39:57,240 --> 02:40:00,800
pretty games so certainly the two of them coming together it's going to be

4106
02:40:00,800 --> 02:40:04,760
very interesting but you know what when push comes to shove money talks and you

4107
02:40:04,760 --> 02:40:07,800
may have thought that so-and-so was not going to be selling out but you know

4108
02:40:07,800 --> 02:40:11,480
when you got bills to pay and you got right he's buying there's always a you

4109
02:40:11,480 --> 02:40:15,240
know as long as it's still maintain some sort of creative control you know in

4110
02:40:15,240 --> 02:40:20,440
other words if as long as Bethesda's not like pulling their chain to the point of

4111
02:40:20,440 --> 02:40:25,680
like choking them out you know creative wise that would probably make sense as

4112
02:40:25,680 --> 02:40:29,360
long as they mutually respect each other in that level then they could easily be

4113
02:40:29,360 --> 02:40:36,000
you know and everybody wins Bethesda makes pretty decent games though I mean

4114
02:40:36,000 --> 02:40:40,080
like obviously you know oblivion is huge fall out to me Elder Scrolls is pretty

4115
02:40:40,080 --> 02:40:42,760
much with their bread and butter that's what pretty much put them on the map

4116
02:40:42,760 --> 02:40:46,360
right and look but let's not forget Bethesda not every game they put out has

4117
02:40:46,360 --> 02:40:49,680
been a huge success the Star Trek game that they did was not you know it's kind

4118
02:40:49,680 --> 02:40:54,240
of mixed but at least it wasn't terrible you'll mix better than terrible so their

4119
02:40:54,240 --> 02:40:59,640
track records pretty good overall so you know even though it might be something

4120
02:40:59,640 --> 02:41:05,240
you didn't imagine before it's not like it's completely unreasonable that ID

4121
02:41:05,240 --> 02:41:10,600
would go to a fairly respectable company like Bethesda yeah as I said it's all

4122
02:41:10,600 --> 02:41:15,120
about whether or not John Carmack felt like it was something that he should

4123
02:41:15,120 --> 02:41:19,640
have agreed with and you know something that I just hope he has confidence in

4124
02:41:19,640 --> 02:41:24,560
his decision or at least have you know or at least it itself is confident in

4125
02:41:24,560 --> 02:41:31,680
the decision to merge with with Bethesda but aside from that yeah I can't I can't

4126
02:41:31,680 --> 02:41:35,440
actually you know end off the call without making a notable mention of

4127
02:41:35,440 --> 02:41:40,440
Michael Jackson's contribution to video games I mean aside from moonwalker the

4128
02:41:40,440 --> 02:41:47,160
fact that he contributed to Sonic 3 Space Channel 5 I don't know I guess we

4129
02:41:47,160 --> 02:41:52,200
never could never really know of how much success this man has because he's

4130
02:41:52,200 --> 02:41:58,480
pretty much proven himself God knows how many times on all fronts not only on the

4131
02:41:58,480 --> 02:42:05,680
on the stage or on the recording studio but in our consoles well you know

4132
02:42:05,680 --> 02:42:10,800
Michael Jackson certainly was involved with Sega he had a lot of love for Sega

4133
02:42:10,800 --> 02:42:15,200
and I think we would all roll over if they would just put out a moonwalker too

4134
02:42:15,200 --> 02:42:21,360
but sadly it is just not meant to be well I just hope you know hopefully they

4135
02:42:21,360 --> 02:42:24,720
could at least port it to Xbox Live Arcade I know whoever owned well but

4136
02:42:24,720 --> 02:42:28,920
it's gonna be good it's difficult for the fact that God knows who also well

4137
02:42:28,920 --> 02:42:33,000
I said again I say I based on the same thing I said to the emailer who wanted

4138
02:42:33,000 --> 02:42:36,800
the thriller album on rock band don't hold your breath because exactly all

4139
02:42:36,800 --> 02:42:41,040
these rights being up in the air just just don't even the legal mess is only

4140
02:42:41,040 --> 02:42:45,360
is just a tip of the iceberg and I also want to clarify it's not that Michael

4141
02:42:45,360 --> 02:42:50,840
Jackson's moonwalker was really that great of a game well the arcade version

4142
02:42:50,840 --> 02:42:55,400
obviously it was just it was kind of all right it was a frickin video game made

4143
02:42:55,400 --> 02:42:58,960
out of smooth criminal that's what was cool about it but at least he had at

4144
02:42:58,960 --> 02:43:03,440
least he made everybody dance whether it be criminals robots or even like vicious

4145
02:43:03,440 --> 02:43:09,360
guard dogs dance when he did his magic you can't ignore that that you know even

4146
02:43:09,360 --> 02:43:13,480
if you hate music which I don't know anyone that says I hate all music you

4147
02:43:13,480 --> 02:43:17,080
can't ignore the contributions that Michael Jackson made to gaming I would

4148
02:43:17,080 --> 02:43:21,040
buy uh I would buy it again just on the fact that you can make the dogs dance

4149
02:43:21,040 --> 02:43:24,680
we're gonna let you go buddy but thanks so much for the call oh yeah one more

4150
02:43:24,680 --> 02:43:29,040
thing happy anniversary guys well thank you I forgot to mention that but and sit

4151
02:43:29,040 --> 02:43:33,800
in seven more years hopefully we'll see we'll see I don't know I'd be 38 at that

4152
02:43:33,800 --> 02:43:38,560
point all right take care buddy bye we'll always let a call go a little

4153
02:43:38,560 --> 02:43:43,760
extra longer if they're gonna do some butt kissing all right let's see Zaku

4154
02:43:43,760 --> 02:43:47,760
pilot 256 asked Space Channel 5 was a Sega made game on the Dreamcast right

4155
02:43:47,760 --> 02:43:53,240
uh yeah I think Sega published it I think it was yeah because Mizuguchi at

4156
02:43:53,240 --> 02:43:58,280
the time worked for Sega so it was a Sega made game yeah yeah I I say I think

4157
02:43:58,280 --> 02:44:02,800
there's confusion because Mizuguchi now has Q entertainment but he was the

4158
02:44:02,800 --> 02:44:05,920
mastermind behind Space Channel 5 when he worked for Sega but yeah and then of

4159
02:44:05,920 --> 02:44:11,280
course space Michael yeah huge well he had a bigger part in Space Channel 5 too

4160
02:44:11,280 --> 02:44:15,840
there's the whole yeah dance scene that was pretty cool yeah you know good times

4161
02:44:15,840 --> 02:44:19,960
good times all right well um gosh it's about time for us to wrap up and get the

4162
02:44:19,960 --> 02:44:23,480
hell on out of here for the night but before we do that we have to go around

4163
02:44:23,480 --> 02:44:27,760
and get everybody's final thought and I think do we get all last-minute stories

4164
02:44:27,760 --> 02:44:29,520
out of the way I think we covered everything we were gonna cover tonight

4165
02:44:29,520 --> 02:44:32,560
right pretty sure all right then let's go around and get everybody's final

4166
02:44:32,560 --> 02:44:35,840
thought dark Sagra once starts off tonight your final thought the second

4167
02:44:35,840 --> 02:44:40,120
density 3 is a freaking epic RPG they really need to give that an official

4168
02:44:40,120 --> 02:44:44,680
release already just put it on WiiWare for real really my final thought is I

4169
02:44:44,680 --> 02:44:49,360
really need to finish the Rydia after years because the new episodes come out

4170
02:44:49,360 --> 02:44:53,040
like in a week yeah just over a week and I'm not ready for him yet I need to

4171
02:44:53,040 --> 02:44:58,720
finish where I'm at right now so yep Loki your final thought tonight my final

4172
02:44:58,720 --> 02:45:06,680
thought is that I need to play more fuel yes you do I need to kick your butt at

4173
02:45:06,680 --> 02:45:11,840
fuel be fun all right all right actually we see we need to go exploring for Vista

4174
02:45:11,840 --> 02:45:15,160
points although I guess it's not really a cooperative type of game pretty pretty

4175
02:45:15,160 --> 02:45:19,120
tough to play that co-op all right that's it guys we're out of here we are
