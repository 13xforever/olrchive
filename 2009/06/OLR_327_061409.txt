and more.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
We still got Tech Master Loki here tonight
Yes, I'm here.
The very busy Techmaster Loki.
Yes, I'm moving.
Yes, you've been moving lately.
How's that going?
It sucks.
Yeah?
Yeah.
But I don't know if the listeners are aware, but you actually moved from an apartment to your house.
Not a rented house, but one you have actually purchased.
Yes.
In this very sad economy, you were actually able to make it work.
Someone else's misfortune turned into your gain.
Thank you, Fannie Mae.
No, seriously.
They had a really kick-ass loan deal.
Got a really low interest rate.
Normally, buyers like us, because we're not putting down a lot of money, you would have to pay mortgage insurance, which...
DarkSakura.com
Wow.
We can do that.
I'm a little jealous, but see, I'm not married.
I don't have someone to share that type of income with.
People say you can get a roommate and so on and so on to make it work, but I just don't.
It would be tough.
It would be tough because what happens if you can't find one?
That's the situation I find myself in.
Or if they leave.
Yeah, it would just be difficult.
Outro Music
Congratulations.
It's a good time to do it because that government program where you get eight grand back in your taxes next year, that's putting a new roof on our house.
Nice.
That'd be awesome.
Quick, anyone want to get married, buy a house with me?
No, I'm just kidding.
Oh my gosh, it's definitely a time to buy.
Now, bringing it back to video games, since that's what our show is all about, since it is now your house, are you doing anything special with the tech?
I don't know necessarily the games, because I know the wife is not a fan of games not called Excite Truck or Bejeweled, but I know you were talking about something tech that you're doing with the babies.
I was thinking it would be cool to do video monitors, because usually how you do
You know, like a baby monitor that's audio or something like that.
But they had a commercial that I saw on TV for like Home Depot or something like that where some guy was doing a project where he had video monitoring for their babies.
But having two of those and we can do picture-in-picture on TV while we're watching TV and stuff, you can see the two babies there.
I don't know.
That would probably be really expensive and a lot of work for something that's kind of neat.
But...
We'll see.
Mainly network stuff.
I'm going to have to run a bunch of networking stuff through our attic because I can't stretch a 50-foot Cat 5 cable anymore.
It's going to be interesting to see how your stories change once those babies are born.
I'm very curious to see what's going to change in the house of Loki.
We'll see.
Congratulations on the house.
I helped him move into it Saturday because that's what friends do.
It's a nice house.
It's very similar to the one I rent, but I only rent it.
It's, you know, with the hardwood floors and the one bathroom and three bedrooms, and the bedrooms are a little small.
I had to put in those floors.
Yeah, they're the laminate.
It's a particle board.
It's kind of like this desk.
More comments from chat.orangelaunchradio.com.
If you're listening to us on All Games Radio Live on this Sunday night, please join us.
Say hello.
Deekman says, you stream it.
Or too creepy.
I think that's a little too creepy.
It's gonna be boring.
Who would watch baby monitors on YouTube?
Well, I guess you'd be surprised.
And Toshin says, Loki, my neighbor has a video baby monitor.
I could get info.
I'm sure it's easy to do because it's just, I think it's just video.
You probably wouldn't do audio.
And so it'd basically just be running the video line through the ceiling to wherever you're gonna watch it, I guess.
Or they may even have it, you know, Wi-Fi.
Which would make things even easier.
They wouldn't have to run anything.
Deekman in chat says, Loki, get the angel care baby monitors.
It beeps if the baby doesn't move.
So advice from another parent, because I know Deekman.
Is that like the, was it everything's okay alarm?
It's all me.
Thanks for watching!
DarkSakura.com
Our cat did not like moving.
But that's pretty cool that you have, like, you know, that we've been doing this show long enough and we have such an awesome listener base that essentially the listeners are offering to babysit your children via your stream.
Well, I don't know.
That's...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
No, I remember playing one thing I played at Sega Rally All-Stars or I don't know.
It's some sort of Mario Kart with Sega characters game.
And it was like Mario Kart with Sega characters game.
But no, what's weird though is they had commentators, which is odd.
I was not imagining commentators in that kind of game.
Is that the game that's supposed to have Greg Proops as the commentator?
No, no, no.
That's Mad World.
That's awesome.
Oh, that's right.
Okay, I was going to cut him up.
That would be... That's already out.
Sorry.
Why did I think that was a racing game?
I don't know, but hey, if they want to come back and do commentary in that game, not changing up any of the language whatsoever might actually make that game good.
No, I...
So I played that.
I think that was on Thursday when I was just like, eh, I don't know what I want to do.
So I'm going to start playing some random games.
I watch people play a lot of stuff, but I don't know.
This week I actually played more Grand Theft Auto 4 because we play that every day.
I played...
Some prototype, which is fun.
It's really underwhelming as far as graphics go.
I mean, it's very plain looking, but if you think about the developer of the game, they actually were the ones that did the Hulk, the ultimate destruction stuff.
It's very simple graphics, but it's the same type of gameplay where you can throw things in the stuff and just go crazy.
You can absorb people and take their life to boost your health and stuff like that.
Thanks for watching!
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
and we get into the topic we got into like a few weeks ago talking about like Saw and that whole thing where like I can't watch the Saw movies because it's too real for me but when the violence is over the top yeah this is over the top okay like I think that stuff is funny like snapping people in half and stuff like that it's just ridiculous okay like Mortal Kombat over the top always has been you can grab somebody you know and just run into the ground with them or like there was one that they had in a video where he grabs a soldier and
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Thanks for watching!
Angry Barry, which is an XNA game.
It's basically Obama the game, the fighting, it's like a Final Fight type game.
It's absolutely ridiculous.
The problem is it's broken on Xbox community games right now.
You can download the game and it won't boot up at all.
And you waste money, which sucks.
But, Angry Barry... Wait, don't these things have to go through like a... Yeah, they should, and it pissed me off because it was working, so apparently he updated something and it broke it.
So, now I paid for this and I can't play it, and it's really making me sad because...
I'm actually looking at some footage of this here in studio off of YouTube.
It's absolutely ridiculous.
You can pick up... The first level, you're apparently fighting old ladies.
Okay, yeah, cat ladies in Central Park.
On the start of his quest, Barry runs into a bunch of old dotties.
I went off the screen.
Wait, let me roll back a little bit.
A bunch of old dotties who have a much different idea of who should rule the world.
As he continues, Barry is haunted by a ghost from his past who may end his quest before it starts.
and so basically the game's kind of funny because he runs around and he can punch things and stuff like that you punch people in the face but he can also pick up stuff like unrealistically like you know the park bench oh no it gets better it gets better he can pick up people by their heads and then he can also pick up like buses and stuff it's just let me fast forward absolutely ridiculous see there he picked up a jogger and he's like trying to smash people
Okay, but the caliber quality of this game looks like somewhere between NES and Super Nintendo.
It's awesome.
Somebody's running by yelling, have my baby, Barry.
Keep going until you get to the bus, because that's hilarious.
Let me fast forward a little ways here, if I can.
Part of me wonders if this is, like, really disrespectful.
I don't know.
There's the bus.
This is awesome right here.
Bunch of old ladies getting on the bus.
Old ladies and stuff.
And he just picks up the bus and starts smashing old ladies.
That's awesome.
Right there.
That was instant purchase for me.
I'm like, I must buy this game.
And I did, like, instantly.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
if it's broken.
And so hopefully they'll fix it.
It says I purchased it and then I'll get to play it.
SSJ100 Matt in our chatroom, chat.orange.radio.com wants to clarify, when the fixed version comes out, you can re-download it and it will be okay.
Yeah.
You don't need to buy it again.
And it's AngryBerry, like B-A-R-R-Y, like Barack, not AngryBerry as in like Raspberry or Dingleberry.
Yes, AngryBerry.
All right.
And it looks awesome.
Interesting.
All right, anything else for your gaming week?
Um...
No, that's it for right now.
Besides, they have Need for Speed Shift now, if you wanted that.
Well, and the good news is, or, you know, the Forza series is continuing without them, and all that.
Anyhow... Project Gotham, I don't know if that's still... I'm sorry, yeah, Project Gotham, I don't know if that's continuing, but... I think it is.
Yeah.
Anyhow, Blur is now like a realistic racing game, but it mixes that with the types of stuff you'd see in Mario Kart.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
All these different types of...
PowerUps in a Burnout-style arcade racer.
Not where, like, you know, pile-ups and crashing cars is encouraged like it is in Burnout, but that sort of, like, look and speed and feel to the cars to it.
And the way they had it set up at E3 is that they had, like, 20 Xboxes all networked together, and everybody was essentially playing the same thing.
And I had a lot of fun playing it.
I think it'll be a fun game on Xbox Live.
It's like Mario Kart, but more real cars.
So, and from what I'm understanding, they're actually licensing real cars for this game.
Yeah.
So, it's like real cars that shoot lightning.
So, it's a little strange, but it was actually a heck of a lot of fun to play.
I think I'm going to pick up the whole thing when it comes out.
I don't know what you're thinking, Loki.
I know you didn't play it, but... Oh, no, you did play it a little bit, didn't you?
No.
Oh, that's right.
The Xbox broke when you sat on the plate.
The server crashed when I tried to play it.
That's right.
I hope.
It looked fun.
Some other games I played at E3 that I wanted to point out.
White Knight Chronicles, I think we touched on a little bit last week.
I didn't play it, but I watched Loki play it.
Looks like a lot of fun.
That's a role-playing game.
Looks pretty intensive, and I definitely want to check that out.
That's a good exclusive for PlayStation 3, especially if you're the role-playing fan type.
Uh, because it looks like it has the huge, uh, landscapes kind of like Oblivion does, but it's more of a third-person oriented game.
Reminds me a lot of Final Fantasy XI.
Like, the landscape's very similar to that.
Really?
There's zones.
Um... But not online.
This game was not online.
It's online, no.
You actually... Well, you can play online.
You can play online with a party of a few people, and then you can do that.
Or it's AI.
And the AI actually is good.
They do what they're supposed to, and they're not doing retarded things.
So, um...
That's kind of cool.
But I think it is online, too.
So that might be fun.
I don't think I ever mentioned last week that I did try out Katamari Forever, which is the new Katamari Damacy game on PlayStation 3 that takes some of the old levels and kind of repackages them.
And there are some newer levels, too.
Like, for instance, I played a level where you were rolling around the Katamari, and you would start in water, and then as you rolled around, you lost water.
Kind of like, imagine your Katamari's a giant sponge, and you're basically rolling it over dirt, and as you roll over the dirt, flowers grow.
So the idea was you tried to paint so much of the ground with flowers in the time limit.
And then there's some secret, you know, the gal that was showing off the game was showing me there's some secret areas where you can find more water so you don't have to run back every time as you lose the water.
And that's kind of the strategy to get higher scores in that level.
So there are some new things in the game.
So Katamari Forever is not just a rehashing of the old stages.
The one thing that was cool about it is that they have different art styles.
There's very unique different art styles now that you can use.
Especially this whole where it starts all in black and white.
And then as you roll over objects, those objects will be in color anywhere you see them.
Which I thought was kind of cool.
So some of these new art styles they're adding are making the game feel...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
I already had more fun playing it than I did Beautiful Katamari on the 360, which I just never got into.
I don't know what it is.
I don't know what it was about that game.
Maybe it's just the controller of all things.
I just could not get into Katamari on the 360.
But the PlayStation 3 one was fun.
They added a new game mechanic, too, where you can actually bounce.
You actually basically jump with the Katamari, which is a little unrealistic.
But hey, I mean, rolling around, rolling up entire islands in the earth is a little unrealistic, too.
You know, I don't like...
The only thing I would change about Katamari is I don't like the action that you have to do, the motion to charge up your ball to do a little dash.
I think it should just be a button press, which would make things a lot easier because it's just a pain in the ass to kind of rock it back and forth to do that.
Yeah, you know, I didn't try, actually try doing that, the dash.
I was playing too much with the jump and the whole, you know, flipping.
I like to do the, you know, you click the buttons and it flips the ball around, so you don't have to spend the whole time doing a turn.
But in the chat, Azure Edge is saying, in Japan, Katamari Forever is called Katamari Tribute.
Yeah, it's true.
It was a different name in Japan.
I believe it's already out over there, so...
It was fun.
I might pick it up.
I was under the impression, I don't know why, I thought this game was an arcade game when I first saw it.
It was a Sony download game, but it's not.
They told me it is coming out on disc.
Yeah, that's what people thought, and it is coming out on disc.
So it is a full disc game, just in case you weren't aware.
One other game I think I wanted to mention... I'm looking at my notes.
Oh, Toy Story Midway Mania.
I never mentioned this game, which is, you know...
Don't write it off as simply a child's little shoot-em game.
This is one for Disney fans, which I know some of our listeners are.
It is just like the ride that they have at Disneyland and Walt Disney World.
They opened them both up this year.
It's pretty much the same ride where you sit in the cars and go around.
However, they have added new stages.
There's a skee-ball type stage and some other little games.
Apparently, it's the whole thing where as you play more and get more points, you can unlock more mini-games.
but here's the funniest thing about it it is going to come with 3D glasses and you can play the games in 3D just like you do on the ride so I think that's kind of funny pretty cool yeah so I think this game is you know if you're a Disney fan for most people especially you really hardcore gamers you're going to look at this and go this is just another crappy Wii game with a bunch of you know little mini games but I think especially like if you have kids or you're just like a Disney fan and you have like for me it's the nostalgia of the ride and being at Disneyland that really does it for me
So, it's cool.
It's a cool little minigame collection.
The other one that I thought was kind of cool is a minigame in it that's kind of like Jenga, where these little block structures will appear, and you load this cannon with a ball, and then you kind of swing the Wiimote to throw the ball, and then depending on when and where you throw it, you're trying to knock over as many blocks as possible.
Boom blocks!
Awesome!
Is it?
Yeah, it's kind of a ripoff of that, I guess.
But I thought that was kind of fun.
So, take it or leave it.
There you go.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
and the main rundown of stuff that happened in the week.
I'm sure you read gaming blogs, you listen to other shows.
We want to expand a little more on having roundtable discussions on a limited scope of stories.
Don't worry, we'll bring you the quick news too, close to the end of the show.
But we're going to try focusing on, in our Part A and Part B, just like maybe six stories each segment that can get a little more discussion.
So if you want to call in at any point during the show to add to the discussion, you can always give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR
or, of course, you can always send us emails and so forth.
Of course, our chat room, chat.orangelonsradio.com is always available there as well.
And then, of course, we're going to spend a little more time in studio talking about these different topics.
So let us know your feedback.
Of course, as always, mailbag at orangelonsradio.com or our Twitter, twitter.com slash OLR or...
The Facebook group, the OL Army, which we haven't really done anything with for a while.
We need to.
And yeah, so we're just going to open it up.
Less stories, more time on each story is basically what it boils down to.
So let's see what happens.
So I'll start off tonight with a news story.
That kind of confirms something we heard about a while ago.
There was a trademark about this a little while ago that spurred this whole debate I think we've had once before on the show.
But it was confirmed.
Nintendo will be launching a help feature inside of their games.
This story comes from USA Today's Game Hunter blog.
Game Hunter's blog, sorry.
And it's talking about how Miyamoto has essentially confirmed that
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Nintendo's Whole Thing in the First Place
Moving on with the story, Shigeru Miyamoto did say in the interview that there's going to be this demo play, is what they're calling it, the tentative name of this, the demo play.
Here's the quote from the article, quote, In New Super Mario Bros.
Wii, if a player is experiencing an area of difficulty, this will allow them to clear troubled areas and take over when they're ready.
And yes, we're looking into this for future games, too.
It's the easy button.
Like in the Staples commercials, you hit the button and easy, you get your way through it.
Good thing, bad thing, Loki.
As I mentioned earlier, I know it's wrong to say this, but this is completely gay.
And the reason why... It does make me want to sleep with games of the same gender.
Exactly.
It does.
But, no, it's...
Okay, I guess it's alright if they want to put this option in to other games like Zelda or something like that.
That makes sense.
Because you're playing it demo-wise, you can learn more of the story and stuff.
New Super Mario Bros.
for the Wii, I can't imagine that has a story at all.
So, really, you're basically taking away the only element of the game, which is playing it.
And so, I don't know.
I mean...
I can't imagine these games being that difficult, and the fact is that you can actually just autopilot the whole thing seems kind of retarded to me.
And also, in the same way, people are defending it, saying, well, this will allow you to be able to make the games more hardcore, more difficult for those that want it, and those that can't handle it, well, they can push the easy button.
But at the same time, why can't they just balance it?
Put the effort into balancing the game so that you have it for the easy players and for the more experienced players.
Oh, I know, like, you know, effort.
No, let's just autopilot the whole thing.
That's even better.
Okay, but what about the argument?
And this is the first thing I think of, too, and I see AlphaCananagram going to it in chat.
Don't use it.
You don't like it?
Don't use it.
I don't care.
It's just insulting that it's there in the first place.
I mean, because really, the message that comes across with that is not that, oh, we're trying to help players.
You know, maybe like Devil May Cry or something like that, or a game that's been notably insanely hard all the time.
Maybe something like an easy mode for that or something, but not necessarily something that just plays the game for yourself.
I don't know, I just, I think the option, the better option should be something more approachable as far as like an easier, you know, gameplay option or something like that, an easier difficulty so that those people, you know, you can take those portions of the game that are going to be frustrating out of it or make them easier on this new difficulty.
I'm supposed to give you a slap on the wrist for calling it gay, by the way, from the chatters.
Whatever, you know.
Obviously he doesn't mean...
No.
No.
It's not even really entirely Nintendo's fault.
I put blame on society for this too because nowadays it's not about winning and losing.
It's about everybody participating and everybody's a winner because they've participated.
That's great, except you're not participating.
You're just pushing a button and the game's doing it all for yourself.
So now that you've seen the end of the game, what's really going to entice you to go through it?
I mean, on your own.
It's not...
And it really just, you know, sends home the message that Nintendo doesn't really give a crap about the core game.
I mean, they do in a certain sense, but at the same time, it really, their console is for the younger audience and, well, we're making a few games for you as well.
Let me read some comments from chat, and if you have a thought on this too, give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR Is this making games too easy?
What's going on?
Some other comments from chat here, and this is one I agree with, is that GoldAnthro in chat says You will have the temptation to use it, that's the problem And for me, that might make me a little nervous too, but let's go to the phones, we have a call Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?
Hello, you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?
And wouldn't you know, the first call we take, it doesn't work.
Didn't use the easy button.
That's right.
Your call needs to be automated.
Can I please pause the show and hit the button?
No, all right.
Here's the thing.
I'm also surprised that this was not launched in the Zelda type of game.
And I kind of get it for that.
But I kind of agree with what GameGuru was saying in chat.
It's a Super Mario Bros.
game.
If you can't play, you may as well give up gaming.
GoldAnthro Is this making games too easy?
I think it is, because people say don't use it if you don't want to.
If you don't want to use it, don't use it.
But there's that temptation that people will use it, because it is there.
If there's no reward for not using it...
I'm sorry, I got my family yelling at me.
You know what I mean.
There's going to be that temptation.
No, that's okay.
That's kind of where I feel, too, is that it gives that temptation.
But I'm trying to look at both sides of this.
I really am.
The Wii is that family-friendly, even your... I'm going to let you go, Goldanthro, but thanks for the feedback.
Is that very...
Wii's got that very family-friendly, soccer mom, let the seven-year-old play, image to preserve.
A feature like this kind of makes sense for a system like that.
I don't think it does.
The problem with Nintendo and a lot of the game publishers and a lot of the companies out there that are producing consoles is this.
They're making the consoles and the games more approachable to people that don't play games, but people are still not biting on them, and so they're like, why are they not?
Let me take another call.
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
Who's this?
Hi, it's Sterlok.
Hi, Sterlok.
What do you think about this whole Nintendo easy mode, or what they're calling it, demo mode?
Is this a good idea, bad idea?
I think it's a great idea.
I'm blind, and...
This would be awesome for something like Zelda because I just like to walk around and just dick around and if I want to get further, it's really easy to just turn this thing on and
I think it's a great idea.
You're saying that you're blind and that you have problems with certain other games.
Do you find Zelda to be too hard the way it is now?
You probably learned to deal with that as you're playing with the video games, right?
Yeah, since I'm totally blind, I just play with sound.
Right.
Are you the same one that sent us emails before on some of these subjects?
Yes.
About some of the music games?
Okay, yeah, I remember you.
I guess here's kind of my thought.
That's a very good thing I wouldn't have thought of before, is that maybe it makes some of these games more handicap accessible, certainly, if there's something that's a little too difficult.
But, I mean, you've kind of come all this time gaming with that.
So why now for this?
Well, the main thing for me is progressing in the game itself.
That's the big thing for me why I think this is such a good idea.
If I want to get further in these games other than just walking around and just doing a bunch of nothing, I would have to get someone else to basically do it for me.
Sterlok, have you had games, a lot of games, where you hit that brick wall?
Yeah, because that's
I'm big into RPGs, so basically I'm sort of restricted to just walking around and fighting around the bells, which I like, but if I want to progress in the story, not a whole lot I can do about that.
Well, Sterluck, I really appreciate the insight and giving us another angle we may not have thought of otherwise, so thank you very much, Sterluck, and you have a good one.
You too.
Definitely something I wouldn't have thought of before.
What about folks who might have something where they can't?
But maybe this speaks to a greater thing about making games more handicap accessible to begin with, and maybe this just isn't the way to do it.
I don't know.
Then that's the case in How Noble of Nintendo.
However, I don't think that's why they're doing it.
I would agree.
It comes down to their... It's a perk for folks, but it's not the reason.
It's okay.
We've made the games easier.
We've made the system that's more approachable for gamers...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
in case they get stuck that's great but you know what getting that knowledge of that feature out there to a consumer that's not playing games I mean I'm pretty sure they're probably not up to date on everything that's coming into you know a certain game they're probably not gonna know about it anyways and it's really just a kind of a waste of time because I don't think it's really going to accomplish what they're hoping that it will accomplish
Let me read a few more things from chat and then we'll move on with some more stories tonight.
But I wanted to read some of these comments.
Azure Edge in chat says, I thought all of this was just when you pause, a movie comes up showing you how to do it.
But when you resume the game, you start off where you were at.
And perhaps that was in the original trademark.
I would have no problems with that.
That's fine.
If they're giving you tips on how to play the game, then yeah, that seems very fair.
Because that way they're helping you along, but you actually have to do it.
And I do encourage that.
This is Spazinator.
A bad idea.
For a couple of reasons.
Now, first being, although Nintendo's not coming out and directly seeing it, they're kind of implying that gamers are stupid.
They have to handle gamers to get them to finish the game.
And you've got to remember, at least back in the original NES days,
And, you know, a lot of people take, uh,
pride in the fact that they play these really difficult games and end up beating them.
I mean, for me, I feel that if a game is too easy, you tend to lose interest in it.
Thank you very much, Spazinator, for the input.
We're going to talk about this a little bit, but I'm going to go ahead and let you go for now.
We move on to other topics.
Some of what Spazinator is saying, he kind of compares to the older games, and a lot of people are very fond of those games.
And I think when I think about this easy mode, yeah, it's making games more accessible to seven-year-olds and ten-year-olds.
But then I think back, okay, well, when I was ten years old, I was busting my way through Kid Icarus, which was one of the hardest games ever.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
The games out here now, if you're going to put out a lot of games that you're trying to make accessible for a 7 year old and they're really super duper easy, yeah, you may get them interested in playing games and they may think that they're all awesome because they're able to finish these games, but at the same time, is that really making the 7 year old a better gamer?
I mean, later on down the line, are they going to be any better, you know,
Thanks for watching!
Alright, one more chat comment, then we'll move on to the next story.
Deekman in chat says, Also, I would probably use it when playing Zelda.
I love the series and the plot of the games, but just can't seem to focus.
But if I can progress quickly without breaking the flow of the story, then please hook me up.
This could be an interesting perspective, and this is, you know, again...
Where I almost support this feature in games like Zelda.
I'm not sure how I feel about it in like a Mario game, but an adventure game like Zelda.
Jury's still out for me on this whole thing.
I can be swayed either way.
I need to see it in action.
But for the Zelda games, I kind of sympathize.
I am such a short attention span gamer sometimes that sometimes I don't want the challenge.
I want that story.
I want to watch the whole thing unfold.
Do you know how many games sit on my shelf that I haven't beat because I quickly move from one game to the next?
Like...
I don't know.
I wish there almost sometimes there was a way I could just go back and finish them all.
But I don't know.
And that's great, but I don't think New Super Mario Bros.
has a story.
I'm pretty sure it doesn't.
So there's really no point.
And on top of that, stop trying to develop technology to demo actual games and give us stupid demos for God's sake.
Seriously.
Thanks for watching!
Thanks for watching!
I don't want to do another maze I want to get to a save point I want to go eat a burger because that's just where I was at that point so you know what I loaded up Final Fantasy Wikia and there was a whole little map on how to get through that room and I just did it and I was like yay that's fine that's okay but see you're not relying on I mean to get you through a certain point and it's just helping you out it's not saying okay you know you need to do this or you know here let me do this for you it's just saying you know here's what you need to do go do it
All right.
And that's fine.
That's just like saying, you know, hey, Rob, I'm stuck in the Zelda game.
You've gotten past this point.
What am I supposed to do?
It's just like that, and there's no harm in that because you're still having to do it.
It's just giving you a tip.
How often do you – I know, like, many years ago, like in high school and stuff, how often did you do that?
Like, your friend would be playing the game.
I can't get past this part.
Give me the controller.
Okay, there you go.
Exactly.
Why isn't Nintendo just bringing back the Nintendo tip line?
I mean, they can make more money that way.
Get some game counselors on staff.
There you go.
All right.
Let's move on with some more news.
DJ Hero Turntable Support for Future Guitar Hero Games
So maybe later on, you know, they can add DJ support as well.
They said they would have liked to have worked it into Guitar Hero 5.
Unfortunately, Guitar Hero 5 ships in a few months.
And, you know, it's a few months before the DJ Hero thing comes out.
So maybe later on they'll add it in there.
But it sounds like a great idea.
Yeah.
I don't think it's a great idea.
I don't think they're going to do it, but it sounds like a cool idea.
I think if anything, if they're going to have that type of stuff, it's just going to be maybe tracks that you can download on DJ Hero.
They'll have the guitar and DJ Element in there.
And if you have an opinion on this or any other story we're going through tonight, 1-877-GAME-OLR is the number to call.
Or our chat room is chat.orangeloungeradio.com.
But, you know, this makes me think about I was playing rock band this weekend.
You know, you were over.
We were checking out rock band.
And, you know, I don't have room for a turntable on top of all the other crap that rock band, you know, rock band, guitar hero, whatever.
Same thing these days, right?
Well, not really.
But same peripherals these days, right?
Yeah.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
DJ Hero Mixing Music Together
Thanks for watching!
I don't know, it'd be a lot of support for a game that they could just add more support to the existing DJ games to just get people to buy that instead.
And there's no real point to have to support it anyway.
You know, I still say you're going to be so limited with this, though.
You know, I don't... Okay, on my Rock Band, I have Rock Band 2, Rock Band 1, and I've got to have at least 40 to 50 download songs.
I mean, I have a lot of download songs.
I've given that company a lot of money, but they've earned it.
You know, a lot of fun nights there with Rock Band.
I, sometimes, you know, when I have friends come over to play the game, they get up ready to sing, they scroll through the list and scroll and scroll and scroll and go, I can't really sing any of these songs.
You know, like there's, sometimes, and I don't know how you guys do it when you play rock band, but I know that we let the singer always pick the song because they probably get the hardest role.
You know, guitar is pretty much the same and drums are pretty much the same and I assume turntable would be pretty much the same no matter what song you're choosing, but it's always up to the vocalist.
And again, how much variety are you going to get if there's only like 10 songs that are going to support the turntable and all this?
It seems like, while it's a nice enhancement, it seems like effort that could be better spent somewhere else.
And the only thing I could see, here would be a good idea.
You would take like a game, I don't think Guitar Hero is the right game for it.
I think Band Hero would be the right game for it because Band Hero is going to be more pop music that has a lot more turntable stuff in it.
Wait, there's actually a separate game called Band Hero?
Yes, there is.
It's basically like Lego Rock Band, because Lego Rock Band's going to be more pop music.
They had a demo, or they had a trailer for it at E3.
I know, I remember seeing that trailer.
I thought... I don't know why.
Okay, call me stupid, laugh at me, I don't care.
But I thought that was kind of like Guitar Hero 5's name.
I thought it was the same thing.
I thought they were just finally admitting, oh, hey, Guitar Hero's not really a guitar game anymore, so they're calling it Band... I thought it was Guitar Hero 5 Band.
Band Hero now is basically the pop, easy, family-friendly game or whatever.
And they're going to have bundles and fun stuff for that.
But I think that would be more appropriate for Band Hero because then you could, say, have a download thing that adds DJ support in if you have DJ Hero.
Or, hey, if you want to...
Be interesting with it, I guess.
And since they don't really sell the instruments by themselves at the turntables, maybe if you have a DJ Hero save file or something like that, it detects it and it'll allow you to play those games.
Or maybe if you have, say, songs available, like download content or something that's Guitar Hero and DJs that you can play in Band Hero.
Let me go to the phones.
We have a call here on our Skype line.
Hi, you're on Orange Sounds Radio.
Who's this?
Hey, it's Dan Shadow.
Hey, Dan Shadow.
What do you think of this whole thing, the turntables in Guitar Hero and Band Hero and all this?
Um, I wasn't really what I called, but I just wanted to try.
Isn't it the new Guitar Hero game, or was it Rock Band, Beatles, that lets you play multiple instruments in replacement of other instruments?
That's Guitar Hero 5.
Yeah, because you just mentioned the lead singer always rolls through whatever song they want and then
you know, like bass, and then no one wants to sing, and that's the, I just think good thing.
The call is cutting in a little in and out.
I think we have the bad connection, but I kind of get the point there that Guitar Hero 5 is kind of letting us do this more enhanced band thing where if nobody wants to sing, then great, we'll have two people play guitar.
Of course, that's more peripherals.
But hey, at this point, you probably have enough.
Yeah, tons of people own them at this point.
You probably have enough, and hell, friends bring them over.
I guess that's probably not going to be the problem.
I can't see four drummers, but sure, why not?
Yeah, I just wanted to chime in and say that's the biggest problem I have when I play rock band is that everyone wants to play one song, the singer doesn't want to play this song or whatever.
Well, that's what I wanted to chime in on.
Go ahead and
Keep on with your DJ conversation.
No worries.
We are experimenting with a new format tonight.
Letting the callers call in while we are talking about stories.
It's perfectly okay if folks want to go back a few steps within the story.
As long as somebody doesn't call in to say, Hey, I want to talk about Doom.
We will have a space at the end of the show for folks that want to call in on any topic.
Thank you very much, Dan.
Have a good night.
Have a good one guys.
Thanks for watching!
All right, TigerClaw in our chat.
Chat.OrangeLaunchRadio.com is saying quite a bit about this.
Very curious about what the Armin Van Buren DJ game is going to be like, which was oddly silent at E3, as was Scratch, although now we're starting to see videos of Scratch be released this week and more.
I've already seen them.
Very interesting.
I think a violin in a music game would be awesome.
But when I read that, isn't that more going the other way?
Putting guitars in DJ Hero, which they're already talking about doing?
Yes, and they are.
I think that's a cool idea as well, but it's kind of the other way.
It's putting guitars in DJ Hero because you're saying you're adding guitars.
But, to be fair, a very interesting line that's being blurred.
Would it be interesting if some of these songs were in both tracks?
You know what I mean?
Not something I think they're going to do this time around, but it will be cool in the future.
And I mean, sure, we're spending $120 on this game and a controller, so I'd hope I'd be able to use it in as many things as possible.
We have the TimeDilationDude in chat says, again, we need more cowbell.
That's true.
When are we just going to get cowbell in these games?
That's what we're waiting for.
Don't they have that like in... Wii Music has cowbell.
No, well, cowbell and that, but like in rock bands and stuff like that where you can play the cymbals.
Tambourine.
It's tambourine.
Sometimes it's a cowbell noise.
Yeah.
Yeah.
But yeah, they should actually have Cowl Kay Lefster in our chatroom asks, is DJ Hero really going to work?
Yeah, I mean, it looks... I think it's going to be fun I think it's going to be a fun game too, and it looks a lot of fun from the previews I already got my order in Yeah, I mean, good thing because... I'll get them both I'm all about Rock Band When it comes down to Rock Band versus Guitar Hero, right now I am totally in the Rock Band camp I think it's the superior game But, good thing for Activision, I'm highly interested by DJ Hero I think it could be a good thing
and that has nothing to do with my prior obsession about Beatmania 2DX if you're still saying wait for the reviews when the reviews come in on this game if you see reviewers comparing DJ Hero to Beatmania 2DX they are morons the games look completely different unless granted they quantify it with what makes them very different because the games are very different
If you want a game that's like beat me in 2DX, you're going to play Scratch.
It's 2DX with better scratching.
That's all it really is.
That's the kind of thing.
I want to play both because DJ Hero is more about mixing music together, which I like doing, and Scratch is more about scratching.
It's really got the ability to do different techniques and stuff in there and really kind of make the songs your own instead of just kind of following note charts and stuff like that.
Yeah.
Yeah, in the end, Scratch is basically 2DX with better scratching.
And DJ Dark Knight in chat says, G4 will, just you watch.
Oh, I have no doubt.
That's especially who I'm targeting that statement as.
So if you're the person that writes the reviews that Morgan and Adam or whatever their names are read on Xplay, do not make that mistake like they did when they reviewed Beatmania on the PlayStation 2 a couple years ago saying it ripped off Guitar Hero.
Beatmania's been around since 1997?
Guitar Hero has been around since 2005 or 2005.
Just because she's a pretty face to look at.
Remember, G4 is not a gaming network.
Not anymore.
They haven't been for quite some time.
They are a network that caters to boys that have some gaming-related shows.
They make a big presence at E3.
They have their booth and they run around and act goofy.
Sadly enough, I think Spike covers games better than G4.
Yeah.
Well, because Spike is for big boys and G4 is for little boys.
It's not the way it's supposed to break down.
And boys who like reality TV, like cops and cheaters.
Not little boys, but you know what I mean?
It's more for the teen and 21-ish audience.
You know what I mean?
It's G4 is for frat dudes.
That's what G4 is for.
G4 doesn't really know what kind of a network it is.
It's just experimenting to see what sticks is really what it is.
Now, Deakman says the E3 coverage is pretty good.
And I do know people that will watch G4's E3 coverage.
You know, and to be fair, they are like the only network that's making a 24-7 practically presence at E3.
So I would actually almost agree they probably do cover E3 better than anyone because they devote so much time to it, you know?
Xenocor in chat wants to clarify something, by the way.
It's Olivia Munn.
I don't know how we got on the G4 tangent, but it needs to stop.
No, that's all right.
There's one last comment.
Xenocor in chat says, it's Olivia Munn, and she's not posing nude.
Half the otaku geeks in the world are going to experience nerd rage.
Guitar Hero Van Halen Guitar Hero Van Halen Guitar Hero Van Halen
The thing about Guitar Hero Van Halen is just that when I watch it, and you could watch it at E3 if you knew where to look, at Sony's booth as opposed to Activision's.
When you watch it, you can hear the cash cow mooing when you're watching the game.
It's re-skinned Guitar Hero Metallica, that's all it is.
and some more stories about this game
I don't know.
They had some decent songs with the other lead singers.
It kind of also makes you go, okay, well, how long was David Lee Roth really with them?
So where are they going to get all their songs from?
And sure enough, if you start to kind of look at the song list, while if you were a fan of Van Halen back in the 80s and David Lee Roth was around...
You're going to be happy.
There's a lot of room for those that have been following Van Halen later on.
I think the game could improve.
And yes, this is Marissa in chat says, It's Van Halen, not Van Hagar.
And that, by the way, is exactly what Activision was quoted saying at one point.
It's definitely Van Halen and not Van Hagar.
Interesting.
But I got to be honest.
Again, I'm just... I'm not...
Really interesting guitar hero, Van Halen.
If I was a hardcore Van Halen fan, I'd be all over this game.
You know, just like, I don't expect probably any of our listeners bought SingStar ABBA, but I did, because I like ABBA, and I'm not ashamed to admit it.
But I'm probably, you know, again, SingStar ABBA probably, what was it?
It was just really a 25-song expansion pack for SingStar.
There's not a damn thing new or special about it.
You know what I want?
They don't even pretend.
I want Guitar Hero, Huey Lewis and the News.
That's some good music there.
How about Guitar Hero Rickroll Edition?
There's really only one song to play in it.
That's what we're moments away from becoming.
Guitar Hero Kenny Loggins would be pretty cool too.
I don't know.
All right.
Well, there you go.
Guitar Hero Van Halen is not a game I'm very interested in.
I'd just settle for some download content with those artists.
I mean, that would be fine.
And that's another thing, too, with Guitar Hero.
I mean, I'm glad that they put out download content I think about every week.
I'm not really sure.
But a lot of these things could easily just be...
Thanks for watching!
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
But yeah, you know.
As they said, and I, you know, this is probably even something we've covered on the show, but I'm just so out of it.
Lego Rock Band is independent of the, oh no, I remember this got brought up.
Lego Rock Band's list, you can't import it into the other games.
Nope, different publisher.
That's right, because all the, yeah, I remember this.
This came up last week.
I don't know if I'm really interested in Lego Rock Band.
I don't think I am.
Beatles Rock Band?
I'm all over that shit.
That game looked amazing.
And I'm not even a hardcore Beatles fan.
I don't even think I've ever owned a Beatles album.
Obviously, I think John Lennon was a great man, as were all the Beatles, and especially they do a lot of great humanitarian work now.
They have timeless classics, and you hear the songs, they're just so embedded in our culture.
You can't help but not know.
But the game just looked like, wow, this is not just a cheap reskinning.
Somebody really sat down at a table and thought, okay, how do we make... Like, not just how do we slap the Beatles in this game, but how do we make a game about the Beatles in this franchise?
That's what really kind of made that game special.
It's effort.
It's the level of effort.
It's not just, okay, we took out Metallica, put in Van Halen, done.
Whereas I think Lego Rock Band was, okay, let's just slap Legos in Rock Band.
Yes.
Make it a family-friendly franchise.
That is about as much effort as, you know, the guitar hero Van Halen.
But, you know, I'll give it to them because...
That's one game.
That's not like Guitar Hero Metallica, Guitar Hero Smash Hits, Guitar Hero Van Halen, Guitar Hero 5, Guitar Hero Band Hero, Guitar Hero Aerosmith, Guitar Hero for the DS, which just came out, On Tour 3, Guitar Hero, which will probably have an On Tour 4 by the time we get to November.
It's just, it's too much.
Too much in one year.
I mean, God, space this stuff out.
Add it as download content.
Thank you for allowing the World Tour downloads to be available in Guitar Hero 5.
Unfortunately, you can't import the whole Guitar Hero World Tour song list into Guitar Hero 5 like you can with Rock Band 1 and Rock Band 2.
And assuming...
That all stays the same, Rock Band 3, which you just build one continuous big song list, which I think is a great idea.
Do you think we'll get Rock Band 3 next year?
Maybe.
I think we will get a Rock Band 3 because they're going to do three-part harmonies in Rock Band, and they may add some different stuff into it.
Who knows?
But I think there will be a new one next year.
I'm still hoping for a keyboard someday, but I know, fat chance.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Yes, now we're going to talk about hardware.
You've probably heard a lot of game companies touting that their game has maxed out the hardware, the PS3 or the Xbox 360.
Well, according to Richard Parr, who works at Criterion...
He's basically said the proof is that you're not the best.
Basically, it means that you're out of ideas.
You always find new ways to do things.
The constraints lift, not just with a new console generation, but with every game you do.
And I agree with him.
I mean, you look at games like Crysis that maxed out all the PCs out there, basically.
Just ridiculous stuff that you throw at it because...
You have three graphics cards in there, high-end processor, all the RAM you could possibly throw at it, and it runs just kind of good.
Not great, but good.
And you know why?
It's because they didn't optimize their code for shit.
And then when Crisis Wars comes out, oh, look at that!
It's the same damn game, basically, and it runs great on all these PCs.
Wonder why that was?
Oh, it's because we actually optimized our code this time.
So really, I think that they are able to push out more, you know,
More code, just better detail, better processing power out of these games just by the effort and tricks that they learned along the way.
Learn to optimize their code, learn to optimize their engines that they run in, and just kind of figure out ways to use every bit of the console's power.
Um, you know, it's interesting because it's challenging people to kind of, you know, think within the constraints that you might already have.
You know, you've got to innovate with what you've already got.
It kind of makes me think about why do games still continue to come out for the Dreamcast and all this?
People
Because there's a big independence scene on Dreamcast.
Not necessarily because they're putting out better games.
But I think a better example would be looking at what we're seeing this year for the Wii.
Look at Red Steel 2.
Red Steel 2 looks awesome.
It runs at 60 frames per second.
The graphics are pretty great on it.
It looks like something that could probably be on a 360 or a PS3.
But they're doing it on the Wii.
And before...
No one thought that was possible.
Even with the Metroid other M, that looks like that could be easily on a 360 or something like that, at least from the videos I've seen.
Some of these other games look really good.
They're running at 60 frames per second and stuff like that on the Wii.
A big one that was, I want to say...
The Conduit is another one that pushed the engine really well on the Wii.
They said, oh yeah, we maxed it out.
But guess what?
They came out with some better games now, other games that are coming out after Conduit.
And...
They're even better.
Well, you mentioning Metroid made me think of F-Zero on the GameCube, and I love F-Zero.
I think that was just an awesome game, especially that particular one that was on the GameCube, and it looked great.
And at the time, did something that was almost unheard of on the GameCube.
It supported widescreen 480 progression, the same resolution that the Wii does.
Yet, I see so many Wii games that don't look as good as F-Zero GX did.
PlayStation 2, there was Gran Turismo 4, it supported 1080i on the PlayStation 2.
I mean, you know... Wow, I didn't even realize that.
Who's to say that these consoles, who's to say that you couldn't develop a Wii game that could support those higher resolutions?
They could do it.
I mean, hell, if a PlayStation 2 can do it, why can't the Wii?
It's got better specs in it.
Well, maybe, well, for one, the Wii has no HDMI, but I guess they do have that particular output.
It doesn't matter, they have component output.
Interesting.
I don't know.
You could do 1080p over component.
Or just do 1080i.
I don't know enough about the tech end to really know.
Is there something within the hardware that has to enable it?
It's memory bandwidth, basically.
You're limited to the video memory and the video processor for those consoles to be able to push out textures and stuff like that.
But I think maybe 720p?
Maybe that's doable.
And if you want to call us on this topic about consoles pushing their limits, do they still have a ways to go or what have you, 1-877-GAME-OLR is the number to call or chat.orangeloungeradio.com.
Or you can do better resolution, like use 720p, but maybe letterboxes down some so that it's not using as much RAM maybe, just black...
Bars on top and bottom or something like that But maybe a hybrid resolution like 540p or something weird I don't know Maybe that's possible
TigerClaw in chat says you can do 1080p over component if the TV supports it most TV won't allow 1080p over component because it doesn't support HDCP that's fine but I mean let's just do 720p then for argument's sake I mean because 720 still looks great I mean and a lot of it's interesting because a lot of these you got to be careful too there's a lot of cheap HD TVs out there they're only capable of 720 they don't even do the 1080 at all but yeah 720 is still considered HD
What's to say you can't do 720 on the Wii?
It'd be interesting.
Really, it's just forward thinking.
I don't think that they're going to do that because guess what?
They think that their audience doesn't care.
That's sad because they could do that and they could push the technology to maybe do that.
And here's, this one comment here is going to take this conversation in a different direction.
Watch this.
GameGuru in chat says, graphical power is overrated.
Yes, Wii's new AV port has four connections that aren't used.
But go back to, graphical power is overrated.
Isn't that what this is really all about in a way though?
Yeah.
Is that, do you really have to have the most cutting edge?
Do we even really need this talk about HD on the Wii and all this stuff?
Shouldn't we just have the fun game?
True, but that's also how they're getting around some of this stuff too.
Because you'll notice, like Mad World, full 3D game, ran pretty good, black and white.
That's the way they got around.
It's a different art style, so they didn't have to push the detail and stuff like that.
Red Steel 2, they're going with a comic book or maybe cel-shaded look to it.
Another way that they've gotten around having to have really detailed textures and stuff like that, you save on texture memory that way.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

Plants vs. Zombies
Thanks for watching!
But I'm very interested in the story.
Now granted, a lot of this is because I love Final Fantasy 4 and I'm very nostalgic for it, so to have the story keep going is great.
It's great though, because I mean, think about it though, if you did that with the Wii, you could actually reuse assets.
You save development time right there.
I mean, you can reuse assets, you can create new things, but you can just, you know, build upon it.
Remember Samet, what was it, Metroid Zero or whatever?
Zero Mission, I believe?
You know, basically Super Metroid.
There are some differences in there, but then there is this whole after part.
I want to read this lengthy comment from Xenocore, because I think it's a good one.
As much as this guy may have a point, this quote has merit, but only as far as what the rest of the game is doing.
This console has been maxed, if you consider what else the console is doing while it's rendering graphics.
If a game isn't as intensive in driving AI or keeping objects in memory, fighters have more room for graphics than a simulation does.
Chat.orange.com if you want to comment.
or 1877 GameOLR.
That's true.
It's all how they use it.
All the different tricks.
I like this comment from Dan Shadow.
Who cares about graphics when Scribblenauts is coming?
That's true.
Scribblenauts is going to be awesome.
How are they going to do a sequel to that game?
I don't know.
Hey, make a game like that on Xbox or something where when you put in bacon, it's real bacon.
It doesn't look like cartoony bacon, but real bacon.
Wishful thinking?
Too bad they couldn't do like a fighting game like that.
Where you're just fighting and all of a sudden you just summon different things.
You know what, though?
I gotta admit, as much as the Scribblenauts demo made me teehee when I was watching it at E3, I do remain a little skeptical about how fun it's really gonna be.
Like, the longevity is what I remain skeptical about.
You gotta remember, folks, remember, go back in the archives of this show, back to 2006, I think?
I said, Nintendogs was the best thing I played at E3.
It's going to be the most amazing game when it comes out.
It's going to be awesome.
All these things you can do is just going to be amazing.
Nintendogs is going to blow away your fucking mind.
And then when the game came out, bored now, two hours in.
It was the type of game where I'd seen it all at E3.
I haven't played Scribblenauts.
I'm not saying knocking it.
I'm just saying skeptical.
For me, Draw the Life.
Another perfect one.
Oh, I can draw my character?
That's awesome.
Did that and got bored.
same developer even but this I think will be fun if not just to show to your friends hey look at that Cthulhu just screwing around with that and hey why not they should have a game that's just like a sandbox type thing where you can just create your own scenarios do whatever
Bandit in our chatroom asks, why is the Wii $99 for God's sake?
Good question!
Or why isn't the Wii $99 for God's sake?
Because they want to make money off of every console.
Yeah, because people are still buying it when it's $250.
Why bother?
Because they think that they can, you know... I mean, look at that.
The Xbox 360 is $50 cheaper than them.
But you know what?
They're so arrogant, I guess, and confident in their system that they just say, eh, whatever.
We're not competing with anybody.
We're not part of the next gen.
Remember that quote?
They're not part of the next gen.
We're a different gen.
But no, it really comes down to because the game is still selling.
That's the reason why.
Alright, let's move on.
We have a lot of ground to cover before we get to break here.
And this next story is about the Xbox 360's Project Natal, which obviously was one of the highly talked about things at E3 this year.
The rumor going around this week is that Xbox Natal might actually be the next Microsoft console.
It might not be something that you buy to enhance with your 360, but it might actually be a whole new type of console.
DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

XBOX 360 SLIM
Loki, what do you think?
I mean, it makes sense that they might redesign the console to be smaller.
I don't think it's going to be the next console, though.
I don't think they're going to increase the specs on it or anything, because they can't.
Because they would alienate half their audience, basically.
I do think that maybe later on, if this takes off like they think it's going to take off, then yeah, it probably will be bundled with...
All the Xbox 360 consoles as they come out will be just like a controller.
I think a lot of people are getting caught off guard with the whole we're going to treat the Natal launch like we're going to treat a console launch.
They're going to put a lot of marketing buzz behind it.
It kind of is a big thing because if it does exactly what it's showing that it's supposed to be able to do, then yeah, that is a big thing and that might get a lot of people interested and they really want to take away that market share advantage.
That the Wii has and maybe possibly capture some of these people that have never played games before because that's what kind of the Wii did.
It's like, oh my god, I can play tennis like I can play tennis.
Or I can bowl like I can really bowl.
But this is like, I can bowl and I don't need the whole controller.
I mean, I don't even need to figure that out.
I just do it.
Well, now, here's something else to consider where they're going with this.
Why has the Wii been so successful?
Because they've been catering to the soccer moms, to the family audience.
Now, there are rumors out there, and I say believe them, that Nintendo's coming out with a new Wii in 2011, Wii HD.
There's rumors about behind closed doors, showing to companies, and so on.
And I say believe them.
Nintendo's the one that's got some catching up to do.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
I think it's very interesting.
Obviously, Microsoft is not content with being number two or whatever they are right now.
I guess it's arguable.
You look at the world picture, whatever.
They're number two.
But they're not in America.
In the world.
Are they really?
Yeah.
But like Japan, they're certainly not.
Well, yeah, but that doesn't matter.
Their market share is really small.
Okay, well, whatever.
This isn't about 360 versus Sony right now.
This is about Microsoft wanting to be number one.
and they're looking at how did Nintendo do it and watch when this thing launches it's going to be launched at families again but it's going to be interesting because now they will still have that whole hardcore gamer whereas Wii is going to be going in reverse they'll already probably have the buy-in from the family audience they're going to need to get the hardcore gamers back on board
That's really going to be tough because I think Microsoft gets it though.
Because if you think about it, look at what they're showing off.
All the games that they're showing off really to their core audience that's already there.
Games that everybody that I think owns the 360... For the most part, there's going to be something that you're going to be excited about.
Now, Natal is really kind of just to gather those people that may be on the Wii and stuff.
But the Wii, everybody that owns it... I mean, granted, there's games that you're looking forward to.
But I know myself...
I'm not going to be, other than Metroid Other M, and that's kind of iffy on that one, I don't have faith in them that they're going to really put out something that's going to make me go, oh my god, this is so awesome, this is the greatest game I have ever played, type thing.
I think they're just going to keep churning this crap that's been coming out year after year.
Thanks for watching!
GameGuru in chat says,
But what I want to say to that is, who's to say where the generations are anymore?
I mean, what's interesting about what we've got with this current crop of systems is that they are entertainment devices in your living room, especially the 360 and especially PlayStation 3, especially, especially PlayStation 3.
You know, their biggest thing right now is the fact that it's a Blu-ray player and does a lot of these, you know, things right out of the living room.
You know, who's to say where the next generation is even going to begin?
Because we have yet to really...
Max out this generation in some ways, but I don't know if there's necessarily going to be a hard line that defines the next generation of gaming after this one.
I guess this is what I'm getting at, because right now the war is about enhancing this current one, which we didn't really have before.
You know, when you had a Super Nintendo, you might have the occasional peripheral to enhance it, but that's it.
XBOX 360 XBOX 360 XBOX 360
The possibilities with these new platforms So you're going to see stuff like the motion controllers Coming out from Sony and from Microsoft And you're going to see the enhancements to the console from the Wii Because it's technically not a new system It's just an enhancement like the DS and the DSi and the DS Lite
GameGuru says, admittedly, it might be the next generation with MotionPlus, Natal, and PSMote.
And I'm almost on board with you there, but change MotionPlus to Wii HD.
And there you have it.
That's why I do think Wii HD is out sooner than later.
What is this all about?
Leveling the playfield.
Xbox, Sony will now have motion control.
Wii will now have high definition.
Now it's a war.
Now it's a war.
GameGuru also says in chat, and I'm sorry to keep quoting from the same person, but just a lot of thought-provoking comments, so props to you.
However, a price drop is due by 2010.
Natal will bomb with the Family Gamer.
Xbox has its stereotype.
I couldn't disagree more.
Not necessarily that Natal will bomb with the Family Gamer.
I don't know yet.
It's too early to see until we start really seeing the games.
You can't base everything off the Milo demo and some of these limited things we saw.
But Xbox having a stereotype to overcome, they can do it.
Hell yeah, they can do it.
And I'm not trying to sound like a fanboy or anything.
I'm saying, you go back.
The nice thing about this show, being around for seven years, you go back to some of those older episodes.
My God, did we make fun of the Xbox.
Oh my God.
The Xbrick.
What a fat system.
What a useless system.
There isn't a fucking game on it I want to play.
This is a piece of shit.
Who wants to buy this console?
This is just a PC in a box.
There's not a damn thing on this worth playing.
These are
Thanks for watching!
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
But see, that's the thing.
Microsoft, they're really not going to have much to overcome because they've got something for everybody.
They've got now these community games, like 1 vs. 100 and stuff like that, that's going to appeal to people that like watching game shows and stuff like that.
Hey, do you think maybe they might try marketing that to elderly people that like watching game shows?
Hey, now you can be on your favorite game show.
Wheel of Fortune, oh my god, that's going to totally be one of you.
It's not going to end with 1 vs. 100, by the way.
And here's my prediction.
I'm throwing this out here right now.
XBOX GOLD
Xbox has finally conned you into buying something like a membership to Pogo.com or one of those sites.
You know where you play the online games for cash and prizes and stuff.
And that's just the first one that popped in my mind.
But there's tons of these sites out there.
That's what the Xbox is going to be.
And they won't take half the shit that a lot of the people say when they talk about those other sites.
Watch.
Watch.
That's what's going to happen with Xbox Live Gold.
I don't know about that.
That's a prediction, not a fact, but I could definitely see that happening.
They've got a lot with their streaming and Netflix, the social networking stuff now.
You have Xbox Live Arcade, the independent games now, the community games.
Um, you know, Xbox Originals, you can download full games on there now, you can, you know, play your DVDs, all that stuff.
So it's, you know, basically an entertainment console.
Now you go to the Wii, and you can play games on it, you can send a message to your friends, that's about it.
I mean, it's really limited, I mean, you can play retro games and stuff like that, but it's really limited as far as...
The Entertainment Value.
I mean, it's really just a gaming console.
But, I mean, maybe this Wii HD will change all that.
Maybe they will hopefully fix their online network.
All right, I've got to read a couple more chats, and then we've got to move on.
Unfortunately, I think we're finding that when we allow ourselves to talk more about stories, we talk about them for like 20 minutes at a time.
We're almost an hour and a half in, and we've still got mailbags slated for this segment.
But I do want to read a couple more comments because there are great talk in chat.orange.com tonight.
SSJ100Matt says,
Yeah, wishful thinking.
Let's hope you're right.
But releasing the next new console isn't going to get the consumer to buy at this time.
And then SSJ100Mac continues in response to when I said the real war is coming.
He says, well, fuck their war.
I'm not going to fund it unless they make it worth my while.
And that's a very good retort is that these things are only as good as the games that are on it, as we've always said.
DarkSakura.com
A lot of people are willing to pay top dollar for entertainment.
Not to devalue what he's saying because I think the argument is still a valid one.
You still have to convince me that it's worth it to upgrade to a Wii HD.
The thing about Nintendo, you know what they've got in their back pocket?
Mario, Zelda, Metroid, the characters you love that's what they're holding in their back pocket and people that will buy anything that says Nintendo and all they have to do is show hey look it's Link in HD boom instant fanboy boner in sales and myself being one of them I'm in line I think a lot of us will be
Let's face it, Nintendo taught us at age 7 You love Mario, and you love Link, and you love these games And they will be with you forever I'm loving Mario a lot less lately though, I just have to say that I don't know Not buying that new Super Mario Bros.
game, sorry I'm not in it now because I don't have the friends to play with on a regular basis I can't buy new Super Mario Bros.
because I don't have enough friends That's what it boils down to So, yeah Um
EA, apparently, they've drawn some attention from...
I guess their protest, not even really a real protest, it's a fake protest.
At E3, they had protesters out front.
Did you see it?
Yeah, I saw it.
I saw the protesters.
Did you think it was real at first?
Nope, not at all.
I had a moment of hesitation because I was looking at it and I was walking by and I was thinking, you know, with the crazies in this state, I almost believe it.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
Yeah, and in fact, that wasn't the only person who bought that hook, line, and sinker.
Apparently, the bloggers at LA Times, who basically wrote that the protesters promoted a multimedia anti-game website, the EA reps, of course, later confirmed to the Associated Press that the whole affair was staged by a marketing agency.
It says now, apparently, game politics, they're pointing out that the stunt has angered
Many real Catholic bloggers.
Margaret Cabaniss of Inside Catholic wrote, It's been clear for a while now that the entertainment industry views Christians on the whole as priggish, thin-skinned, fun killers.
Has anybody at EA actually read The Inferno?
I'm sorry, but that's kind of funny.
Another blogger, I guess, at Catholic Video Games wrote,
Thank you for watching!
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Um, and yeah, I do have to laugh because I do see Catholics unfortunately that way.
Being Catholic myself, I, yeah.
And now I'm thinking back on the whole thing and I'm kind of like, oh my gosh, I was so stupid to even believe it for like a minute.
Because like one of those people, I swear to God, was dressed in like the Puritan outfit.
Like the fucking Salem witch trials, like out there, you know, in the fucking like churn in the butter outfit.
Burn the witch!
Burn the witch!
Well, you should know, we should... And I should, I...
but here's what I ask you guys should you be mad that they did it or should you be mad that people believed it that it actually was happening for a minute because unfortunately with some of these other things that sometimes you hear about the way and I'm not talking about you know most people are pretty normal but that you know
No.
and you know at the same time I think this whole you know stunt it didn't really do anything other than draw attention to obviously the game which is what they're hoping that it would but it's not like the protest was oh my god there's so much full frontal nudity in this game it's unbelievable and the violence and sex is just crazy you know then people like oh I gotta play this game you know like I would have been like tell me more you know just but no it's just like oh there's the devil in this game really Dante's Inferno there's
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
I shouldn't even mention it because after what I just said, I wouldn't want to compare the two because there's these obvious loons that go out there and protest these funerals of people that have served for our country.
I'm not even going to say who they are because I don't want to give them attention, but they go out and protest these funerals of soldiers who died in the war saying, this is because we have fags in America.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
Do we have anyone that wants to comment on this?
1-877-GAME-OLR Did you think it was real?
Did you buy into this for a minute?
I want to know.
Or are you Catholic and pissed off?
Do you not remember when we did a protest or we were kind of observing of a protest for Booth Babes back in 2006?
And that was all just a That was all hoax too, and that got picked up by a lot of bloggers But nobody went to the outpost, because wasn't that Scott's outpost?
Yes it was And nobody went Well that part of the plan failed, but it still got picked up I shouldn't say nobody, he had a decent crowd, but I think they were hoping for a little more Yes, part B of the plan, not exactly executed correctly, but the part A part
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
I actually found it hilarious because I went to Fanime not too long ago
There were actually protesters protesting Fanime.
I'm not too sure because I was looking at them from a distance.
I guess they were protesting against hentai and all that stuff, against the anime porn.
But the really funny thing was they had a cosplayer who came as Jesus to the anime convention, and he just went out there, and it was just hilarious.
There's always somebody that's got to push the buttons.
Did the protesters respond to the man in the Jesus cosplay?
They just ignored him.
They had this other cosplayer who came out as Jesus, but as a raptor dinosaur.
It's called 4chan The house of the internet Why can't they be at E3?
Anyway, I wanted to respond to this real quick because yes, it is a little off topic, but I need to say something because obviously, you know, being gay myself, I have a whole lot to say on this.
SJ100Matt says, you know, Rob, not to get off topic, but the same churches, private organizations are running the same hate ads on the radio in New York for anti-gay marriage legislation.
So, again, this just goes back to the whole, that's why I believed it when you had the chick in the Puritan outfit there with the sign that says, you know, Dante's Inferno, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
Because when I see these ads and I hear these hate speech and stuff like that on the radio about, you know, withholding people's rights, when it's in the goddamn Constitution on the 14th Amendment, no state shall pass a law that robs people of the pursuit to life, liberty, etc., etc.
okay like when I see these ads that's what I hear in my head burn the witch burn them throw them in the river see if they float don't give them any rights it's it's it's the archaic way of thinking it's always something sorry if I'm getting a little too personal and political for you but deal you know this is you know my rights that are being affected here when have I ever shut up about that topic on the show all right anything else to say about the protests Loki
Uh, no, it was retarded looking.
I mean, the whole thing was a little silly, but I will admit, I believed it for like half a second.
I really did.
General Gradover
sent us an email wanting us to check out their podcast.
Well, I haven't checked it out yet, sadly.
I'm behind on the email.
But none2k.com.
I'm always one to support independent podcasters.
I hope that wasn't a porn ad or something in disguise.
Will somebody please check that website out and make sure it is a legitimate indie podcast for me?
I want to read this email.
This email comes to us from... I don't want to read the real name there.
I don't think there is a real name.
I will say the email says Nutman, so we'll call this person Nutman.
Loki, can you please not yell so much?
No, I can't.
I had to turn down the volume almost ten times in episode 326 because Loki was yelling so loudly it was hurting my ears.
I can't be alone in this, right?
P.S.
OLR is awesome, as is Loki.
I guess you just need to turn it down a little bit, Loki.
Well, you know, we try.
This could be a problem that we've moved studios.
We unhook and hook up the mics every week.
We do rely on the live listeners to tell us if things sound way too crazy.
So live listeners, if we are too loud, let us know, please.
We'd be happy to turn down the volume a little bit so you guys don't have to suffer so much.
But it's probably not so... I mean, Loki's yelled for seven years.
That's his thing on the show, if you haven't figured that out by now.
That's not yelling.
I don't yell.
I don't know what you're talking about.
We'll try to make sure it doesn't get out of control.
So, chatters, please feel free to speak up if Loki is getting too loud.
Let's see.
We got a lot of emails this week.
This comes to us from J-Rod.
Hey, OLR folks.
I'm writing in a comment on Left 4 Dead 2 Boycott.
I want to stand on the other side of the fence from all the opinions in the OLR studio just for argument's sake.
I'm not one of the people who are butthurt about this, but I can understand why people are pissed.
I agree that the game is coming out way too soon since the first one was just released in November.
The reason people are pissed isn't because they are spoiled, it's because they expect more from Valve with integrity compared to, say, Activision in regards to putting out sequels for a cash grab.
Thanks for watching!
to address Loki's statement on huge E3 lines for the game and how everyone is going to buy it.
That's fine and dandy, but I don't expect to hear any whining when everyone buys piles upon piles of the newest Guitar Hero and Wii Fit sports games.
Which is funny because we just whined about that earlier in the show.
Also, one more shorter point.
Everyone at the OLR studio seems to be taking a crap on Sony for their lack of content for this year.
Have you all completely missed Sony's biggest release of the year, Infamous?
I'm actually surprised to hear nobody on the show talking about it because it's a very big PS3 exclusive release put out by Sucker Punch.
PS, $250 for a PSP?
Apparently cocaine is a hell of a drug.
This email is sponsored by the Olive Garden Home with the never-ending salad and breadsticks.
Yeah, I heard about Infamous.
I'm well aware of it being out.
And unfortunately, though, I'm playing Prototype, which is almost... I mean, it's not identical, but I mean, it's the same type of gameplay right now.
And I think you didn't hear us say anything about it because the game, like, came out.
So there wasn't really a lot of, like, hoo-bub about it at E3.
It was, you know, more of... They had it there.
I think they had it there, but it was just, you know, people weren't really paying attention to that because they're like, hey, this is out next week.
Let's look at, you know, all this other stuff.
And then it seemed like, I think part of the point you were trying to make last week is that it seemed like there was this huge gap in the rest of 2009, and then we've got all this stuff that's supposed to come out in 2010.
Although it does seem like, you know, we'll be peppered with a few nice things here and there.
Yeah, I mean, Infamous looks good.
I'm planning on picking it up maybe later on, but like I mentioned earlier, I have two PlayStation 3 games, though, that have come out back in... One in November, one in...
Thank you for watching!
I don't think it's Microsoft's fault I think it's EA's fault
E.A.
would be the publisher.
At the same time, though, they're saying, oh, well, we've made enhancements to the AI, to the director, and there's stuff that we couldn't have done in Left 4 Dead 1.
And really, at the end, it's the developer deciding to do it or not.
Because they...
They don't have to.
And we're talking download content, you know.
You know, they could put out those enhancements, you know, the map packs and stuff like that for Left 4 Dead or, you know, other stuff, maybe Team Fortress 2 and stuff, maybe add, you know, sell it.
They could put that stuff out.
But, you know, if it's, you know, the fact that it's being, you know,
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
Thank you for watching!
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
And at the same time, like I mentioned before, don't you guys think you might be a little bit spoiled by them?
I mean, I think their support of the community and everything has been huge.
I mean, look at what they're doing with Team Fortress 2.
It's just like updates upon updates for this game that came out, you know, a while ago and still, you know, huge support for it.
And I think at the same time, you don't realize that, you know, yeah, they're putting a lot of support behind this, but at the same time, they need to make some money too.
And yeah, that's not an excuse, I guess, in the gamers' eyes to put out another game.
But at the same time, maybe there's something that really they can't do, or they felt, okay, this is different enough that it justifies its own release.
I don't know.
I mean, you can't just have everything be exactly the same all the time.
Things have to change, so...
I guess, you know, if you don't like it, don't buy it.
And then, you know what?
If the sales suck on it, then you'll learn, okay, maybe we can't do this.
If that's really, you know, a money grab.
Uh, yeah, we have some comments on chat, and, uh, you know, again, it seems to be that most people are saying, Actdeft says, bah, cry more.
That's my opinion on the Left 4 Dead 2 boycott.
GameGuru says, I'm willing to give Left 4 Dead 2 the benefit of the doubt, because it means Left 4 Dead 1 will be cheaper.
There you go.
I don't know.
I guess we'll see a little more when this game actually is released.
I think that's when I have to reserve my ultimate judgment for is when the game's released.
If it stinks then, then I'll be right there in line with you guys.
And if they try to push out Left 4 Dead 3 in 2010, if Left 4 Dead 2 stinks, I will openly mock it here on this program.
I mean, and just, you know, I wouldn't exactly blame Microsoft for it.
I mean, look at the company that's helping them publish these games.
They're known for putting out numerous sports games each year numerically.
I mean...
I want to read this email real quick, and this comes to us from our old buddy Rene.
I'm not going to read the whole thing because it's very, very lengthy, but I do want to read bits and pieces of it and give this game a little shout-out here.
Greetings, OLR peoples.
Rene here, and I just got into the free limited beta for Ion Online that happened for the weekend of June 7th.
I'm trying the game out because Warcraft has become the doldrums and also because it's become my best friend's next fangasm until Final Fantasy XIV.
Thanks for watching!
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Something WoW neglects.
If you're in a high traffic area and it's really bogging your system down, it's no problem.
Press a keyboard combination and all other player models will disappear.
I didn't get to try out stuff like parties, alliances, emotes, etc.
There's a lot of interface elements that would need a plugin for WoW to show up.
For example, a quest tracker or a level gauge for quests.
For some reason, there's a quest to steal a bathing nymph's clothes too.
I've taken screenshots of what I've seen around the game with the game running almost everything at max settings.
No anti-aliasing, decreased shadow and water effects.
Please skim through it and post to chat if you would like.
Hopefully Aion will not disappoint.
I'm buying the limited edition and getting suckered into playing it anyway because I want to play with my best friend.
My expectations are low because WoW's PvP just left me insulted with how slow and unfair it was.
Maybe Aion will be a little closer to something resembling PSO.
Lastly, I'd like to apologize, especially to Sky, for bringing up hopes for a Mega Man Legends 3 for E3.
Sorry!
This email is brought to you by Benefiber.
Everyone needs their damn fiber.
Fuck yeah, bowel movements.
I have a question, and this is kind of E3 related, but in the whole Mega Man Legends thing.
I remember Capcom said they had two secret games that they hadn't announced yet.
One of those got leaked, and that was Tatsunoko vs. Capcom, All-Stars or whatever it was.
What the hell was the second one?
Well, hold on, because we've got a call, and I bet this caller might know.
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
Who's this?
Hey, what's up guys, it's the Rob D. Rob, we had you on hold while Loki was saying that.
Do you know what that second game is?
I think it was a Resident Evil title for the PSP.
Ah, okay, that's right.
I remember hearing that being announced, and I asked a couple people about it, and I think that's what it was.
That makes sense.
Well, Rob, we have the Skyplanes open all night tonight, so I know you're calling in to respond to something in the mailbag.
In fact, you said on chat something about this whole Left 4 Dead 2 boycott.
What are your thoughts on it?
Well, here's the thing.
I've seen a lot of different complaints.
Obviously, people love to complain about everything on forums and on podcasts and everything when it relates to the video game industry because people are passionate about it.
It's their interest.
And I've seen people defend a lot of stupid things.
I've seen people defend us getting nickel and dimed for horse armor.
And you know what?
That even brings up a lot of...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
We flipped upside down.
Now we don't want sequels.
We don't want these companies to actually give us new engines and give us new sets of things to do.
We want expansion packs.
What has changed now?
I would give one of my good kidneys to get a sequel.
Well, certainly before this year for Street Fighter and now for a true sequel to Chrono Trigger or Marvel vs. Capcom 3.
Why are people upset that they're getting more a sequel to a game they love?
I don't get this.
S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
Well, I think the argument being, and again, I don't really know the other side as well, maybe we'll get emails on it next week, but I think the argument is they feel like, because this is being put together so quickly, because the early screenshots and gameplay indicate it's basically Left 4 Dead 1 with new characters and during the day in a new setting, that this is basically like a guitar hero Van Halen of Left 4 Dead.
But we're making our judgments on a handful of trailers and a few screenshots.
And you hinted at this earlier, that this is Valve.
This is not a company.
Admittedly, I think it is published by EA, right?
Or maybe you're talking about Rock Band.
No, this is published by EA.
Yeah.
I understand that since it is published by EA, that is some cause for concern.
But you know what?
This isn't a company that has done this in the past, that is developing this game.
We should give them a little bit of trust.
Deekman in chat says they think it will break up the community.
It will split them between the two games.
I don't know if I necessarily see that so much.
We'll look at Call of Duty World at War and Call of Duty Modern Warfare.
The games that that happens to are the sports games.
that's the one where you go into EA 2010 you know whatever and then 2009 is abandoned you know but most games you still find you know pretty like case in point EverQuest 1 and EverQuest 2 granted completely different type of game because people invest a lot more time into those types of games but EverQuest 1 still has probably more of a community than EverQuest 2 so any other thoughts Rob D before we let you go and wrap up part A here
Not really.
This whole issue just ticks me off so much because, again, there's so many games that I can think of and I don't want to bash it, but there's so many games that I enjoy more that I would want sequels to and these people are complaining because they are getting a sequel to it and in good timing, too.
Well, let's just hope that the sequel's not cheap.
Let's hope that what you and I are thinking is the case and that this game will be pretty awesome with a lot of new features or else, I don't know, they may have a point.
I think they'll eat crow.
But anyway, see you guys later.
Alright, take care, Rob.
Yeah, I don't know.
I think, I don't know.
I can't tell until I play the game.
DarkSakura is on her way home, so it sounds like she'll be joining us for Part B tonight.
We'll be right back in about 5-10 minutes with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
For those of you guys listening on the podcast though, you only have to wait like 5 seconds.
Aren't you lucky?
We'll be right back with plenty more stories here on Orange Lounge Radio.
Welcome back everybody to Part B of tonight's episode number 327 taping live on allgames.com on this lovely Sunday night.
We are here, Orange Lounge Radio, myself, Loki, and making her way back into the studio, DarkSakura is here joining us for Part B tonight.
Hi, I'm just, I will be officially joining probably in about another 10, 15 minutes.
You had a PE class or something tonight, right?
Yeah, I did.
I'm taking, well, it's walking slash jogging slash running slash cardio slash whatever we want to do as long as it gets the heart rate up for 20 minutes.
That's the class.
And it's mostly online, so it's honor system, you know, pretty much.
But the test our teacher has us do now and the fact that she watches us walk our mile...
I don't think, unless someone really can fake it well, I don't think anyone's going to be able to.
Interesting.
And apparently this is her third one, and she's had a lot of success with it, so I'm pretty happy.
All right, well, that's all right.
Loki and I are going to continue to juggle the stories, but please chime in.
I know I told you before the show about the new experiment we were trying tonight.
We almost went two hours with part A, six stories, but lots of opinions out there.
Well, you know, I actually, I kind of, I was thinking about it actually while I was doing my very painful because of my shoes walk.
No, I got new walking shoes and I need insoles for them because it makes my arch hurt.
But anyway, enough fitness talk.
I actually want to get back into playing DDR.
Because I walked a 13 minute mile when I was playing DDR once a week.
I'm on DDR.
I went to Roseville Golf Land this week, the place where video games go to die.
I played that lovely, lovely Beatmania 2DX distorted machine they had.
Player 1 black keys are sticking already.
Gotta love it.
That's okay.
Right side pride.
Whatever.
Ha ha, I don't have to deal with that.
Die in a right side fire.
Burn.
Well, now that I'm not upstairs anymore in my apartment, my DDR hard pads, as soon as I figure out how to ground them from the static electricity buildup.
Let's not revive the DDR discussion from last week because I'll just get really sad.
The whole thing.
My pads actually started falling apart.
Now you're going to have to mod them for eight arrows.
Remember, that's what we're getting in the PlayStation.
No, I'm sorry, that's not real DDR.
I don't buy this Konami bullshit.
No, we can't think of anything.
Let's add more arrows.
I'm more curious.
Wait, hold on about DDR.
I'm more curious what Jamie was thinking on her walk because it was about the show and the whole thing.
Well, no, I was just thinking about what it was going to be like and it actually is going to be more like when Larry King has people call in except we're cooler and he's old.
Well, you know, and I think a lot of the feedback I've kind of heard over the couple years we've been doing this, you know, because it seems like every year or two years we try something new with the format.
So about, we've been doing what, this whole combined A and B for about, what, a year and a half or so?
I think one of the feedback I get is, you know, we already kind of hear about the news.
I tune in to hear you guys, you know, talk about it, make jokes and so forth.
And the fact that, you know, not a lot of shows are as interactive as you guys.
I mean, granted, there's lots of shows that are trying to get interactive, you know, but they're kind of few and far between, right?
Hey, Rob.
What?
A dick went fart.
What?
I'm laughing.
I am going to go freshen up.
Let's see.
Let's get back into some of that gaming news that we're going to spend a little more time on tonight.
Of course, you can call us at any time.
1-877-GAME-OLR.
If we don't get to the story you wanted to talk about tonight, though, we will open up the skyline at the end of the show for Open Bar.
Loki!
You're going to start us off this half with another story.
Yes, I am.
So apparently the PS3 motion controller that they showed off at E3... You know what?
That always happens.
Damn it.
Sorry.
Maybe someday I'll learn how to fix my audio cues.
Sorry.
Yes, PlayStation 3.
Yes, so the new motion controller they showed off during their E3 press conference, it's apparently going to be compatible with existing games, which it makes sense because you can patch games and...
Why not?
I'm not sure if it's exactly going to work the way, say, you think... I don't know, a controller... Like, it wouldn't be mapped.
Like, if I move my arm down, it's not going to move the analog stick left down or something like that.
I don't think it's going to be like that.
But they may be able to patch it in to other games, which makes sense because they patched in DualShock 3 support.
Why not?
And you know what?
I support that.
I mean...
That'd be kind of cool.
Some of your older games get new life later on with this controller if you happen to buy it.
But here's my thing and the reason why I want to talk about this a little bit.
Do we really need motion control to be shoved down our throat in every game?
It doesn't have to be, but it's an option.
It's a good way, say, you put out the motion controller and there's, say, five games that support it.
Now you can have a bunch of games that support it, but it's still going to feel tacked on.
Maybe this is what I need to make me feel better about this.
Maybe callers want to input on this 1-877-GAME-OLR.
What...
Game would be better if they went back and added motion control.
What Sony PlayStation 3 game is going to be better if they go back and add this whole Sony... It doesn't have an official name, does it yet?
I think somebody said the PS3 mode.
Cosmic Ice Cream Cones of Wonder.
Okay, the Cosmic Ice Cream Cones.
What old PlayStation 3 game is going to be better with the Cosmic Ice Cream Cones?
I don't know.
Seeing as most PlayStation 3 games are on the Xbox 360, we don't have that yet.
Here's my thought.
Maybe they come up with a control scheme for a first-person shooter.
and then boom, they can put those in the first person shooter games.
You know, something that works well.
But yeah, you're right, I don't know.
Don't you think this is only going to show up though in the actual Sony, you know, first party in their own developer type of games?
Probably, yeah.
But, I mean, I don't know.
This is all coming from, you know, I want to say, Jack Trenton, who...
He says, personally, it's very difficult for me to perceive God of War 3 played with a Wii controller.
But it's a different experience that doesn't lend itself to certain types of games.
But I think our controller can be used with every game that's on the system now and every game that we're working on.
So he could just be blowing smoke up someone's ass.
My controller's awesome!
It works with everything!
It's super awesome!
Everything that we touch turns to gold!
You know, it's basically his...
Thought on it.
So really we could be reading way too much into this.
I think the games you're going to see that get this enhancement, like Infamous, Killzone 3, all the first person shooters basically, Uncharted, and Resistance.
Those will be the games that will support this whole Cosmic Ice Cream Codes.
Honestly, I don't think it's any of these games at all.
I think since this isn't going to come out for a while, it'll probably be...
I would be fine if they didn't even patch it backwards because it's just going to be tacking it on.
It's just, I don't know.
It's 1-1 control, so unless you have it really programmed in the game to be really intricate, I don't think it's going to work because you're just going to be making a gesture and it's going to do an action just like the Wii.
and I think a lot of it is resources for me that's why I kind of bring this up you know I know there's a lot of people out there that would say well what's the harm so they want to go back and add motion control in these games is that such a bad thing it's added value it's something extra but I'm saying well resources that could be used to instead make new games better why go back and patch the game with motion controls when you can make the sequel have motion controls
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Unless there really is a team still working on it, which I don't think there is.
I don't think there is either.
Let's move on and talk about something else with Sony.
And it has to do kind of from the same sort of original source that the whole PlayStation 3 motion control can do with.
I want to talk about the president of PlayStation, Jack Trenton, and leaks.
And a big quote he said, you know...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
I don't know, at the same time.
A lot of people that work in the game industry stay in the game industry, so I would think there's talk amongst people.
Yes, they all sign NDAs, but I don't think they hold up.
Sniff out your moles.
If it's really a big issue for you and you really want to crack down on them, start releasing false information.
And then the people that report on it, you release a different one to each person.
And the people that report on that, then you know where it came from.
And then Trenton continues on with this quote.
Really?
I'm tired of all these podcasters that go on air and talk about all the different ways they interpret a patent.
No, he didn't really say that, but that's the way he's really saying it.
Really didn't water it down because the PSP Go, which has been rumored to be coming out for a while now, and then leaked by them, I mean, by Sony through Core, which really, can you complain about leaks and stuff when your own magazine seems to put out the information before your press conference?
Really, did it water it down at all?
In fact, I don't think it did.
If anything, it got people's hopes up, and then we saw what they announced the features for it, and we're like, eh, that sounds stupid.
It's like, oh, you didn't add a second analog stick?
Oh, you didn't make it so that, I don't know, it does other things other than normal PlayStation?
Oh, it's not going to be cheaper than the PSP 3000 or something like that?
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
What a great entry-level PSP system this is going to be.
It's going to be a great, cheap device that people are going to use.
They can get rid of the disk.
It's going to be cheap.
It's going to be easy.
What was the real surprise that we all got slapped with at E3?
No, I'd like to go on the record saying that I never thought it was a good idea.
But I did think that the whole not having a UMD drive in there was a stupid idea.
I couldn't believe that they were that stupid to do that.
And sure enough, they were that stupid.
Oh, but it has Blu-ray, and it's $600!
So whoever's determining what the prices should be at Sony needs to wake the fuck up, basically, is what it is.
And stop eating crayons, Jamie is yelling from the kitchen.
Isn't the door supposed to be shut while recording is in progress?
No, I'm kidding.
Alright, if you want to comment on this, 1877gameOLR, looking at some comments in chat, GameGuru says, cheap is the term that Sony needs to learn.
D5T says, moving to flash-based media is the future.
Movable parts are old.
See, I'm almost with him here.
I mean, you can't say Sony, screw you for losing UMD when you're also watching on the same token.
Microsoft's now getting into digital distribution with the whole classic Xbox 360 games, or I'm sorry, new Xbox 360 games available for download on the site.
You know, we were talking in the first half of the show tonight about Xbox possibly launching a cheaper console next year that's going to be targeted at the family audience.
Who's to say that if they do that, this system...
is going to lose the disk drive completely and could possibly be an online-only download thing using the hand-wavy Natal device to make you choose your games.
It won't work because people like buying stuff.
They like having the physical disk in their hand.
And yeah, I know people that have the iPhone and stuff go crazy over the App Store because there's everything in there.
But you know what?
It's just...
If you could go, if it took like discs or something like that, I'm sure people would probably want to buy this because you know what?
You know what you can do with discs?
You can return them when they don't work.
You can return them when you don't like them.
You can return them when you're done with them.
You can resell them.
With digital download, you bought it, you're stuck with it.
If it sucks, too bad.
You bought it.
Deekman in our chatroom, chat.orangelandsradio.com says the reason they gave for the price was to compete with the iPhone.
If Apple can do it, then so can we.
And
Basically, they think they can get away with it since people pay for it.
Apple's tech, they'll pay it for ours.
Oh, well, whoops.
It was just announced this week that the iPhone's coming down to $99.
DarkSakura.com
And seriously, if Sony didn't see that one coming, they are mentally deficient.
And whoever did not see that one coming at Sony needs to be fired.
They have no business working in business.
A moron walking off the street.
My mother, who doesn't even know how to put a CD in a computer, could tell you.
Apple, I love my mom, but she's technically stupid.
And I can say that in the nicest possible way.
Even my mother knows.
every every June Apple gets up there parades out Steve Jobs they couldn't do that this year obviously with their one more thing everybody knows Apple upgrades their shit every year and gets people to buy it all over again it works for Apple it is not going to work for Sony at those prices
Sony is not Apple.
And the other thing too is they have a huge following with Apple.
Sony doesn't quite have that following with the PSP.
And to be honest...
I really, really hate to say this, but there's more features in the iPhone than there are right now in the PSP.
I mean, it's got a touchscreen on it.
Hell, if they added a touchscreen to the PSP, that might be a whole different story.
Hey, that might be worth picking up because that's completely different.
It's going to open up a whole different set of possibilities if they had support with Bluetooth or something like that.
Big whoop.
Oh, goody.
And look, you know, and to those that want to make the argument that, well, you know, Apple releases their new, you know, toys at high end prices, you know, granted, I'll give you that.
Their laptops, I don't think I'm going to buy another Apple laptop.
They are too expensive for what you get.
For someone like me.
Your mic's not on, dear.
Oh.
Oh, shit.
I went to talking with some other people in the art industry, you know, and a couple people were actually saying that they were noticing that there's not as much need for people to have a Mac these days in the industry now that the PCs are catching up and, you know, different programs are saying, hey, people actually use PCs, you know.
So even that edge is starting to blur.
Yeah.
I think Apple's in for a rude awakening in the laptop market within the next couple years.
But they've got it on the iPhone.
Apple right now is a phone company.
That is what Apple is doing best.
They are a phone and music company.
They don't really... Well, God, I'm going to get so much hate mail for this.
But look, as somebody who's going out there wanting to get a new laptop and so forth...
DarkSakura.com
You have the $199 iPhone, the $249 PSP Go.
I can watch movies on both.
Check.
I can get on the internet with both.
Check.
I can play music on both.
Check.
I can play games on both that I download online.
Check.
The only thing the Sony PSP has got is that the games are of a higher caliber than the ones you see on the iPhone.
I will give it that.
Right now, and supposedly the 3GS has better specs or something than the 3G, so maybe they will...
Be a little bit better later on.
And it also doesn't have actual control pads, so that does kind of limit them as far as games go.
Um, Ranma in chat says, Rob Roberts, everything you have done on your MacBook can be done on a $500 PC laptop flawlessly.
That's what I'm starting to find out too.
And part of what I loved about Macs is that they were so easy, you know, so great.
But here's the nice thing.
PC, finally, someone at Microsoft kind of wised up.
Oh my gosh, Apple's starting to bite into us a little bit here with this whole, I think they're making it easier.
I don't know.
I'm going to open up this whole can of worms on the computer debate.
That's not what I want to do.
I want to talk about the PSP Go and all this stuff.
And the whole fact that it's $2.49 is way too much to be charging for that.
Actually, that wasn't even really originally what I wanted to talk about.
It was supposed to be about keeping secrets in the industry and people not respecting confidentiality in the industry.
There's this fine line here.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
How much is too much in regards to confidentiality?
I mean, the demand is out there.
People want to know.
The millisecond these things are thought of, Sony is even thinking about doing this.
People want to know about it.
How far is too far with this whole confidentiality?
Did this go too far?
Did the PSP go getting announced early and a lot of these other things?
Was that too far?
I don't know.
I don't have an easy answer for this.
Then don't tell these people.
If you want to keep a secret, you don't say anything.
You don't keep a secret by saying, go and tell 100 people, oh, by the way, don't tell anybody this.
But don't you have to tell your developers that are going to be making the games?
Well, obviously someone else is blogging about it and leaking this stuff out.
You have people that are leaking out stuff all the time, and they can hide behind the internet.
They can be whomever.
They can be some industry mole and go on the record and stuff, and they probably get some sort of joy out of having the exclusive story that no one knows about.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
How come all these other people can get away with it?
That's where it gets de-irritating.
We've also seen in the past too with NDAs where other people are given preferential treatment because they're a big website and they're going to run an exclusive story or let's decide which website gets to run the exclusive story.
And that's the shit that needs to stop right now because that's just encouraging people to one-up others.
I'm sorry.
No pun intended.
Anyhow.
Let's move on.
Outro Music
And removing features to cut costs is not an answer, Apple.
So, anyhow.
Sorry.
I apologize for getting completely off track.
Let's get back to video games.
And oh, what a video game on the next story, correct?
Yes.
Of course, this is a classic in...
A Remade Game Now Coming To Xbox Live Arcade As An Exclusive For A Limited Time That Would Be Of Course The Brand New Or I Guess Brand New Remade Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Turtles In Time Reshelled Which Looks Pretty Awesome Actually Completely Redone 3D And Of Course Will Be Available On Xbox Live Arcade July 22nd But As For The Playstation Network
Later this year.
Is there some underlying technical problem that's causing this to be delayed?
I don't think there's a technical problem at all.
I think it's a deal.
Because if you think about it, this is actually part of the Summer of Live.
Or the Live Arcade, Summer of Arcade, whatever the hell they're calling that.
So they're going to get an extra marketing push because of that.
And probably the deal was that they got to put it out later because of that.
What marketing push?
I mean, really?
Is being in the Summer of Arcade that much of a boost to sales?
It might be.
Really?
Yeah.
What do they do?
What's the big deal about being in the summer of arcade?
The fact that they cluster a lot of highly anticipated games all together.
But for most Xbox Live Arcade games, I can think of anything I've anticipated.
I knew where to seek it out and buy it.
Do they run extra ads in magazines?
They have like a...
I guess.
It just doesn't seem like that much of a boost.
Well, I'm just speculating.
I don't know.
Maybe they had trouble developing it on the PlayStation Network.
I don't know what it is.
I don't think they would because Ubisoft, I would imagine.
Well, they're publishing it.
Who knows who's developing it?
I don't know.
It could be something retarded.
It probably is something retarded.
But you know what?
Just get used to it.
I need to see more of this game in action.
So it's pretty much a port of the old arcade game but with the cooler, upgraded graphics?
Yeah.
I guess that's kind of neat.
Super NES Exclusive, wasn't the Super Famicom version a direct port?
Maybe Turtles and Thieves
And then DarkTetsuya says, I forget, I just remember the Super Nintendo version having the extra levels and bosses.
Ooh, are we getting some of that in this?
Extra levels and stuff?
There might be extra levels.
I mean, THB Ninja Turtles was a pretty huge Xbox Live game when it came out anyway.
Folks playing it online and having fun on live with it.
So I'm sure this is going to be no different.
I'm sure it'll be fun.
Yeah.
So, there you go.
Alright, well that game will be coming out July 22nd, I believe it was.
So keep an eye out for that.
Metal Gear Solid Rising
A lot of people were waiting for it, the whole Metal Gear Solid 4 thing.
Of course, now it should be noted, Metal Gear Solid Rising is not exclusive to the Xbox, or it's going on Xbox and PlayStation.
And a lot of folks are saying, well, this is, you know, it's going to still be, it's like Metal Gear is continuing on, or what have you.
But, apparently, it is a whole new engine for Metal Gear Solid Rising.
If you're thinking this is Metal Gear Solid 4 Plus, or some game that was made in Metal Gear Solid 4's engine, uh-uh.
Sean Eyestone, who is an assistant producer at Kojima Productions, says the team is remaking Rising's engine from scratch.
Their goal is to make it look better than Metal Gear Solid 4.
This is from a Kojima Productions podcast that came out this week.
Apparently, they are saying it is a big project like Metal Gear Solid 4.
The team is serious about making it look as good as possible on every platform.
Thanks for watching!
And, you know, now it's coming out on both systems because I think they know that it would be a mistake to skip on the 360 because there is a lot of potential sales there.
Especially now that they didn't have Metal Gear Solid 4 and so they're going to get a lot more money out of it.
And it's all about money nowadays because, you know, times are tough.
So, I'm not surprised.
And I am...
I don't know, it'd be weird if they kind of went in the opposite direction.
But, I mean, it makes sense to them, just to put it out on both systems.
TheRobD in chat, by the way, says, So we're going from talking about a Turtles game to talking about Solid Snakes.
What does this show become?
Yes, it's Reptile Jungle tonight on Orange Lounge Radio, apparently.
Chat.OrangeLoungeRadio.com if you want to make a smart-ass comment like that one.
Um...
But, you know, I guess at first, when I first heard about this, I was like, oh, they're cranking this game out so fast because Metal Gear Solid 4, they're just going to reuse that engine and so forth.
But now, that doesn't seem to be the case.
So...
You could look at this a couple of ways.
I get really excited when I hear, oh, they're going to make it look even better and so forth.
But weren't they saying one of the reasons that they didn't port Metal Gear Solid 4 to the Xbox 360?
And let's face it, folks, they never will at this point.
It is not happening.
This is what you're getting.
Be happy with this, Microsoft fans.
There is not Metal Gear Solid 4 coming to the Xbox 360.
If that was ever going to happen, it would have been announced before this.
So, that being said...
They said that Metal Gear Solid 4 would not be ported to the Xbox 360 because it was made for Blu-ray.
The types of graphics that were on it and everything that was packed in that disc was made for Blu-ray.
So that makes me think, okay, well then by that argument, if they're scaling this back to fit every platform, they're going to have to scale it back, not make it better.
Wrong.
And this goes back to what we were talking about earlier.
Melgar Solve 4 was going to max out the PS3, but now they've learned that they can optimize their code, there's different techniques, and to be honest, I mean, their excuse was, oh, it's so big it can only fit on Blu-ray.
But at the same time, you know, oh, and no one wants to swap discs, by the way, which is retarded because there's like a five minute install between like sections of the game.
I mean, come on.
They could have easily swapped discs.
I'd rather spend two seconds to swap a disc than spend five minutes loading a section of the game to my hard drive.
And if I really wanted to do that with multiple discs, I can do that now in the new Microsoft interface.
I can install each portion if I wanted to.
TigerClaw in chat makes a really good point.
Says, also noticed Metal Gear Solid Rising says, lightning bolt action.
Maybe it's a new type of gameplay.
Given that Raiden is a ninja, it could very well be a hack and slash game.
Have we had anything confirmed that this is a stealth action game like the other Metal Gear Solid games?
Or is Tigerclaw into something here?
Because it's not Metal Gear Solid 5, it's Metal Gear Solid Rising.
Maybe the type of game we're anticipating here should be, maybe we need to set our expectations for something different.
Maybe we're looking at an action game, a beat-em-up.
I don't know about that.
The Turtles in Time version of Metal Gear Solid.
I don't know about that far, but that is interesting that it doesn't say anything about the whole stealth.
It's lightning bolt action.
Do you think that would be as successful if they change up the genre?
Maybe.
Maybe not.
I guess it just depends on how good the game is.
I think people will bitch and moan, but they'll probably still buy it because they're Metal Gear Solid fans.
Perhaps.
Alright, we'll see.
Let's continue on with some more news.
If you want to call us on this or any topic we're talking about, 1-877-GAME-OLR.
We had a phone call a little while.
Don't be shy.
Give us a call.
1-877-GAME-OLR.
Well, Xbox Live Community Games, they're getting a little bit of a facelift.
Starting in late July, Xbox Live Community Games will now be changing to Xbox Live Indie Games.
And apparently it's in response to community feedback in order to increase understanding and promote the games.
So they're going to launch XNA Game Studio 3.1 and
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
Thanks for watching!
A lot of them are really good, but a lot of them are really, really bad.
What do you think about this whole rating system that's coming into the games?
Is this going to be a good thing or a bad thing?
I think it's a good thing.
It'll be able to separate the crap from the not crap.
I would love to see user-rated stuff, so I can look at these games that people think are great.
Maybe have a way that you can see what your friends rate it, or something like that.
If I have similar tastes as, say, Rob, I can...
DigEffect
You know how stories get bumped to the top of dig.com that you're like, why the hell is this here?
And it's because so-and-so has millions of friends that will dig up the story for them.
And to be fair, we've had it happen to our stories before, and I'm sure that's thanks to our OL Army.
So don't hear me wrong.
It's not necessarily a bad thing or whatever.
But I would be worried in regards to this context with the whole indie games is that what if a game maker...
and DarkSakura.com
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
But it sucks that somebody who, you know, might be a fan of some other show who doesn't know how to support any podcasting, who deserves to have karma bite him in the ass or something, can have somebody go around and rate a bunch of other shows a 1 and nothing gets taken, you know, no action gets taken against that user.
Like, that user's opinion carries just as much weight as somebody who actually thinks out their reviews.
Does that make any sense at all what I'm saying?
Yeah, it makes sense.
Like...
I would fear that just because somebody has a lot of friends, their game gets all this extra exposure.
And you look at the top shows on iTunes.
Again, going back to iTunes, sorry.
But it's something I feel pretty passionate about.
You look at all the top shows on iTunes, most of them are one-ups, IGNs, GameSpots, G4s, commercial, down-your-throat type fare.
And it kind of sucks for the rest of us when podcasts are supposed to be an indie thing.
Thanks for watching!
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
rate the raters would be a great thing rate the raters that's something they need to bring to iTunes is rating the raters and you kind of can to a little bit you can say was this comment helpful yes or no but it really doesn't have any bearing on the author as a whole I think that's something I would like to see is you rate the rater and as the raters rating goes up their rating carries more weight and as it goes down it loses weight that's what I'd like to see
That was a lot of uses of the word rate.
Only in the perfect world.
Yeah.
But I don't know.
I kind of think that's the way to do it.
But yeah, that one indie game you were talking about earlier in the show, Attack... What was it?
Barry Attack?
It was Angry Barry.
Angry Barry.
And you know where I saw that.
And I hate to say this, but IGN, actually, they do a segment that's a community shower, I think is what they call it.
And basically they cover...
Thanks for watching!
Maren in chat brings up a good point and says, but what if somebody doesn't agree with the rating person and so they rate the person lowly based on their opinion, not their review rating?
That's a fair argument.
I mean, I guess...
The system's, it's going to basically, what it's going to come down to is, yeah, there's going to be people that are going to do that and, you know, rally their friends, but in the end it all equals out because there's a lot more people not involved with them that, you know, are going to be raiding stuff, so that it'll be just a slight fluctuation and that's really kind of, you've got to account for that kind of error in there, so.
Well, I hope you're right.
We can all hear you eating over there.
I just hit the mic with my plate.
Also, Kay Levster says, I think it will sort itself out.
The Xbox Live community is far more liquid than Dig.
I don't know, though.
There's some real, like, come on.
You've played Halo Online.
I don't know if you have, but a lot of you have played Halo Online.
There are some people who play those games online.
I don't want to hear their opinions.
I don't want to hear what they have to say.
You know what I mean?
These people that get on there and say N-word, N-word, F-word, F-word.
You know who I'm talking about.
Is there a way I can just block out their ratings?
If I block them on Xbox Live, will it block their ratings out too?
I think it would be really smart and it would also, once again, go back to tying in.
You can do, like, with your Xbox Live Arcade games, you can see where you rank, like, in the leaderboards versus the world versus, you know, your friends.
And I think the reviews should also be the same way.
If your friends have reviewed that, you should be able to see their reviews or you can just see the community as a whole.
Ooh, like Netflix.
Netflix.
Perfect.
Perfect model.
And Xbox has it in with Netflix anyway.
Right?
There you go.
There you go.
Steal from Netflix.
There's the answer.
Great.
I want to move on to another story, and it has to do with Microsoft.
A whole lot of Microsoft tonight.
But Project Natal, going back to that, we were talking about it a little bit during Part A, but it's made its mainstream television debut.
That's right, it showed up on Late Night with Jimmy Fallon.
It showed up a little earlier this week.
Oops, I'm bringing up the actual Hulu thing here in studio, although they're going to do a commercial here, so I'm going to mute it for that because if the commercial people aren't going to pay us, I'm not going to rebroadcast that.
But I do want to show a little bit about the whole Jimmy Fallon late night thing.
They actually showed Natal on it, and I don't know why, but they all were wearing these red jumpsuits and things when they were demoing it.
But certainly it was interesting, if nothing else, to actually see Natal.
This being played by somebody who wasn't a Microsoft spokesperson.
You know what I mean?
It was a real person at least checking this out.
Let's actually see if we can check this out just a little bit here.
It's a bunch of red shirts.
Kill them.
I'm going to actually forward ahead a little bit here in the video so we can actually see where they're playing.
Jimmy Fallon, you're not funny.
Still.
Let me forward a little ahead to where they're actually playing.
It's like a 3D little breakout game.
This is one of the games they were showing, actually, at E3.
It's one of the demos.
Kind of cool.
Yeah, it looks like fun, you know, to flail around like a fool for a little while, but I don't know for how long.
Again, I don't think there's an actual game here, but if this is a minigame in a much larger game, I think this could be cool.
You're doing it like volleyball.
Yeah, I mean, the game, you know, it looks like it might be fun for a little while.
I don't know about the longevity of it, but, you know, a lot of Wii games.
I think this is a demo.
This is a demo, though.
Yeah, but, okay, yeah, to be fair, it's a tech demo, no, like, gameplay.
So was Wii Sports and Wii Play?
So a lot of the things you saw on Wii Play were tech demos, too.
I think this will come out if nothing else is an Xbox Live Arcade game.
You'll see this.
They'll make a game out of this somehow.
I honestly see a whole lot of potential for this technology, though.
There really is.
Honestly, I'm not ready to pass judgment on it yet.
Really, I'm not.
SSJ100 Matt makes a correction to something I was saying.
Correction, Rob, that was the only demo they did on stage, I believe.
That's a good point.
When they did that whole Milo thing, that was a pre-taped video.
But they did a demo on stage, though.
They did that exact same game on stage with Project Natal at the press conference.
So this is like their touring game that they have to show at the stuff.
But still, the nice thing about it was it was, you know, say what you want to about Jimmy Fallon and his humor or lack thereof.
He's not somebody in the game industry.
He's like a...
Thank you for watching!
and they weren't letting regular people play it.
This was a huge step in actually seeing this.
By the way, sorry to get off track here, but what is up with Jimmy Fallon tapping into the game industry lately?
His thing was that he wants to treat game releases like movie releases.
He's a big gamer, I guess, and apparently he's going to start doing more content like this.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Well, to be fair, you know what?
To be fair, Conan had a real rough first six months.
You know, a lot of people wrote him off when the show first started.
He didn't find his niche for a year.
So I'm willing to give Jimmy Fallon a year, whatever.
But all that aside, you know, he has been pretty decent, I guess, about coverage.
I feel like I'm getting more gaming coverage watching Jimmy Fallon than I am most times I'm watching G4, E3 accepted.
You know what I mean?
Yeah.
They had Jason Sudeikis or whatever his name is kind of around at E3.
That's kind of funny.
I like the little video they did for that.
Yeah, Kay Levster in chat makes a funny comment.
He wants to get his games for free, thus now he's scared.
TigerClaw says Jimmy Fallon is a bit of a tech geek.
He had the guys from Dignation on the show before.
He's living up to his promising of promoting video games.
Well, I'm glad somebody is.
Alright, well, regardless, it was kind of nice to see Natal actually kind of making a show on a big, you know, well, I don't know if you want to say big, but a fair, a show that has at least a million people watching it and getting, you know, a live, real person who doesn't work for the company playing it.
Now to kind of change topics a little bit, apparently Alexey Pajanov, the creator of Tetris, of course Tetris just had its 25th anniversary not too long ago, apparently he's saying that he wants, well it's so huge right now with 125 million copies sold,
and probably one of the biggest, most recognized games out there.
He's saying they could see probably an evolution of Tetris becoming a sport.
Of course, the future is that a country that has 48 million people living in it and the biggest casual gaming site in the country has 24 million registered users.
That country is Korea.
That's what's going to happen in the rest of the world.
So kind of like, you know, everybody competing in this first virtual sport.
Sports like baseball and football were created at a time when their future was a lifetime of physical activities and physical fitness.
But now that's not as important.
It's more about mental fitness today.
And Tetris is a virtual sport that exercises the mind.
That's the definition of a virtual sport.
So how exactly would... I guess I'm not getting it.
How exactly... Where would the sport be in this?
Competing one-on-one.
It's just, you know, a bunch of people in a Tetris tournament.
The end.
Hmm.
Interesting, though, that it seems like we always have this video games as a sport discussion comes up once in a while.
Remember when they wanted to make DDR a sport?
Or they did in a couple of countries.
I know, but here's the thing.
I think we're looking at it...
When we say sports, we think physical sports.
And he's trying to say that there's other sports out there, like chess.
Chess is not a physical... I mean, you play it physically, but it's more mental.
Is chess at the Olympics?
I don't think so.
I don't know.
That's a very good question.
I wonder if one of our chatters knows.
Is chess an Olympic sport?
I don't think it is.
But, like, you know, stuff like that.
You know, nowadays, you know, with a lot of gamers out there, and now they have, you know, the...
Championship Gaming stuff that they do which
Making people into actual teams and stuff like that and promoting them like a football team and stuff, that's cool and all, but I don't know.
Not really the model I see.
Three no's in chat, by the way.
Chess is not an Olympic sport.
In fact, I even Googled it, and there was an article in Time Magazine August 5th of 08.
Chess and bridge enthusiasts, they are lobbying the International Olympic Committee to allow their games.
I don't think that they should be.
I mean, the Olympics is a physical sports competition.
It shouldn't be.
DDR shouldn't be really a sport.
I mean, you play it physically, but it's not... I don't know.
DDR is hard to compete in anyways.
It's basically about accuracy as far as a way to actually grade it and freestyle and stuff.
It's kind of stupid because that's just interpretive dance, so...
I don't know.
So why shouldn't Tetris be on... Did you ever see the movie Dodgeball?
No.
Because Jamie's giving us this look of like, what the hell are you guys saying?
That's the joke.
I want to know what planet you're from.
All right, anyway.
What else?
Ah, now I lost my train of thought.
Choo-choo, derailed.
Is this the type of thing that he thinks should be televised or what?
I guess we don't know.
I don't know.
I mean, this is just him making a comment and bloggers picking up on it and going, Oh my god, he thinks it should be a sport!
Well, let's say it was the type of sport that you would see on The Ocho, or in all reality ESPN2 or something like that.
Would you watch it?
Nope.
I'm curious, chatters, if Tetris was a sport and they broadcast the big showdowns live on ESPN or ESPN2 or ABC Wild World of Sports, would you watch it?
I guess this all goes into competitive gaming.
Human Tetris.
Well, they did make a show out of that, aren't they?
Isn't that going to be a show on Fox or something?
It is already.
Yeah, it's the wall.
They did it as a gag on Ellen, like five minutes a week or something.
Well, it was in Japan.
It's an actual show in Japan, and they do it for fun there, but, you know, we have to do it for prizes.
No such thing as fun in game shows.
Osfer in chat says, I go to Ohio tournaments often, and I can say that DDR is definitely competitive enough to be an Olympic sport.
Chat.orangeentrader.com Kay Lefster says, Watching Tetris is like watching golf.
So, no.
There's a whole channel dedicated to golf though, mind you.
Exactly.
A whole channel.
It just wouldn't be something that, I mean, it's hard to make it interesting, I guess.
If you're going to say no to that though, what about competitive gaming on TV?
Should we just not have competitive gaming on TV then?
Like the Counter-Strike tournaments and whatever the first person shooter hit of the week happens to be that they're playing online?
Should they not be televised either?
No, I don't think it's an issue of them being televised at all.
It's just a way of how we're able to capture it and film it.
Sports, that's easy to televise because usually all the gameplay and stuff is going on in one area.
You can zoom back to catch the whole field and stuff like that.
Doing Counter-Strike, you can't really film that.
There's no way that you can see everything that's going on all at once because of the nature of the game it is.
You have to focus on the different players and stuff.
I guess...
I don't know, it's a, you know, NASCAR, you can kind of do that kind of stuff where you can film the whole pack of cars and stuff, but they do, like, the in-car camps and that kind of thing, but, um, it's just, it's hard to film it and make it interesting in the same way as, like, a football game or a baseball game or something like that where they've been doing it for years and they've figured out, you know, they have commentators and know what they're talking about and stuff like that, but it's like...
If you started filming Counter-Strike or something like that, and you started talking about it, and you had commentators going, I don't know who these people are.
I'm aware that Counter-Strike exists and what it basically is, but I don't know who any of these players are, and this wouldn't really be interesting to me.
I don't know.
It's just really tough to broadcast this stuff, and you're not going to get the same responses like...
The Rob D in chat makes a comment.
Let's see.
This is the problem with competitive gaming.
How many different things can happen?
In football, you might see something that you've never seen before every week.
In DDR, the participants aren't even interacting.
It's a matter of seeing who scores the most.
I think it would take a lot more animations and reactions to make it more interesting.
And it's hard, too, with a fighting game or something.
I think the fighting game would be the easiest thing to...
Film, because it's all one screen, you can see all the action all at once.
But the problem is, it's moving so fast, it's hard to commentate on that.
You can't really commentate, whereas there's baseball, there's a lot of different...
Thank you for watching!
Also a lot of talk about that old show Arena on G4.
A lot of fans of that show in our chat room right now.
I wasn't that big on Arena.
You know why?
Because it was so heavily edited.
You were only really seeing the highlights of every match.
And I don't know, I felt like I didn't learn enough about the game and the actual strategy and how to get better from just seeing.
And it was so fast, the way they went back and forth from all the different pieces.
I never felt like I really understood what was going on watching that show.
Maybe it's just because I'm not into first person shooters as much as I am other games, but...
See, they could do something, I don't even know if a game exists out there like that, but like Call of Duty 4, actually this would be more like Operation Flashpoint 2, I think, because it's more open world.
But you could do something where you have two different teams, you could show them strategizing you.
about the game beforehand, you know, planning out stuff.
They could talk about the different possibilities, how they may be able to, like, okay, you know, team, you know, the red team right here can, you know, go down flank under this, you know, through this valley or something like that, you know, but then they have to watch out.
So there's a lot of commentary and, like, visual aids that they could do there, but it's just, it's really tough.
Once again, and I pretty much stress this almost every sentence now, it's really tough to film this stuff, to make it interesting.
You just...
I don't know.
Unless it's like a NASCAR game or like Project Gotham would kind of work because they had the spectator mode where you can actually watch the cars and stuff racing around almost like as you were watching a television production of a race.
So you could do something similar like that and that might work as far as commentary and stuff goes.
I don't know if first person shooters are really going to work because it's so massive and there's so much stuff going on.
SSJ100 Matt says this, and then we're going to move on towards the end of the show here.
The fact is, statistics and ratings show people don't really care for watching people playing video games.
Yet StarCraft televised competitions works in Korea.
TigerClaw in chat says the problem with showing live gameplay of Attorney is the action can get very repetitive and the average viewer will get bored by it.
While us gamers are used to seeing the repetitiveness of the games.
Alright, we're going to leave it there.
If you have further comments you can always send us an email.
Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com But we want to get to the FUs of the week.
And of course something has to inspire the FUs of the week.
What better than a stupid gamer doing something stupid?
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
The older brother said the weapon automatically went off when the two fought over it.
By the way, they're saying that it is unlikely the kid will be charged because he is under 13 years old and the entire incident appeared to be an accident anyway.
That's the part that disturbs me a lot.
Like, a lot.
Like, I realize he's a child, but...
Oh my god, like, not a mention of the parents, and like, what parent keeps a shotgun accessible to their 11-year-old?
Obviously not, you know, a good one.
Oh.
This just gives gamers everywhere a bad name, too.
I hate it when stories like this are picked up by video game blogs, too, because it's just kind of like, this really didn't have anything to do with video games.
Yeah, they fought over video games, but, you know, maybe not so much the gamer blogs, but I hate it when the mainstream media picks up these stories, because it makes gamers look violent when this really has nothing to do with the video games.
This has everything to do with just blatant stupidity and bad, bad, bad, terrible parenting.
So with that, the FU's of the week.
Oh, DarkSakura, would you care to start us off with a rant of your own tonight?
F you to not letting shit go.
Loki.
Um, F you to moving, especially my cat, which it's not really her fault, but she can't sleep right now because she's worried and doesn't know what's going on.
Cats have trouble adjusting to moving places, so she kept this up all night.
Oh, and F you to myself for accidentally breaking the, uh,
Waterline going to my fridge, causing it to drip, but in defense, I think it's broken before I messed with it anyway.
But it cost me $175 to have a plumber come out this morning and fix it.
Um, F you to people that you thought were great friends that seem to disappear off the face of the planet altogether.
Um, you know, it just kind of sucks, like, to be felt like sometimes you're being dropped like a hot potato, uh, in, I don't know, for whatever reason.
So, it just kind of stinks, you know.
Friends are supposed to stick by each other through thick and thin.
Sometimes I get the feeling that's not happening.
So, F you to, uh...
Those general feelings of angst.
I hope it's all in my head.
That's all I'm saying.
All right.
Let's move on towards the end of the program here.
I think we want to get into the rapid fire news tonight.
So just kind of going over some of the stories we didn't talk about more in depth, but things you might want to know about anyway.
DarkSakura, you want to start us off with your share of rapid fire news tonight?
Well, we've just had Green Day sign up for Rock Band, so we'll have 21 Guns, Know Your Enemy, East Jesus Nowhere from 21st Century Breakdown, which was not really a good album.
Then we have Sam & Max 1 coming to Xbox Live for 1600 Microsoft Points.
Good, more people will try it now.
Yep.
Also, World of Warcraft is slashing mount requirements so that you can get them at level 20.
And epic mounts will be available at 40, flying mounts at 60.
Whoopty shit.
And then the new Zelda game, which there's not a whole bunch out on, though they're saying that it should include the Motion Plus.
Actually, sorry, that it may require you to have the Motion Plus.
Marissa Congusto in chat is actually commenting on the Green Day story.
Green Day rock band, most of their songs are only three chords.
Well, you know, that would work, though, because the easy mode, you only have three buttons, right?
So I guess they could just kind of line it up there.
Yeah.
Loki, Rapid Fire News.
Alright, so apparently Target is now offering gift cards with select MotionPlus games and Guitar Hero Smash Hits.
Apparently if you, an ad that they had running, I guess the week of June 14th,
It's showing that if you buy Tiger Woods PGA Tour 2010, and that's with Motion Plus, and Grand Slam Tennis, you will receive a $20 Target gift card.
If you happen to buy Guitar Hero Smash Hits, you get a $5 gift card.
So hey, that's cool, $5.
Rock Band is getting some music this week with Spinal Tap and Evanescence.
From Spinal Tap, the track pack is going to cost you $7 or 560 Microsoft Points.
That includes Back from the Dead, Rock and Roll Nightmare, Saucy Jack, and Warmer Than Hell.
Each of those can be purchased for $2 separately or 160 Microsoft Points.
Evanescence pack is going to be $4.
440 Microsoft Points or $5.50 and that includes Bring Me to Life, Call Me When You're Sober and Way to the World and of course each of those can be purchased for $2 separately or 160 Microsoft Points
EA has confirmed that a small team is working on Mirror's Edge 2.
Big duh.
Sequel for a game that was pretty fun.
Is that going to be the name of the game?
Mirror's Edge 2.
Big duh.
So, no surprise they're working on a sequel to a successful...
S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
that was behind it.
They will be running the game I guess for a little longer so if you are in the middle of the game you can actually finish it.
But if you don't care to wait for that I think the PlayStation blog has all the information as far as what's going on there.
So check it out if you want to spoil it.
Alright.
Well, before we wrap up the show, we are going to open up the skyline and take your calls.
But first, we didn't get to the classic game of the week in Part A. We've got to get that taken care of tonight.
It just wouldn't be a week here at Orange Lounge Radio without the classic game of the week.
So every week, DarkSakura likes to dig through the great archive of gaming and pull out a game that you people ought to be playing.
It's the classic game of the week, and here it is.
What should the kids be playing this week?
Donkey Kong Jr.
Seriously.
It is seriously a classic game.
It's one where Donkey Kong's little kid wearing a diaper has to go rescue Donkey Kong from Mario who has captured him.
and basically you just climb on ropes and drop fruit on these mechanized little big mouth trap thingy thingies and then you have an electrical stage in different areas and it's actually supposed to be the guy
Um, Steve Wiebe, um, had the highest score on this one, actually, and he did pass Billy Mitchell on this.
So... The untold story.
Yeah, I don't know that Billy Mitchell has surpassed it, actually, since then.
Um, his, uh, score was 1,033,000 points, and Steve Wiebe got 1,001,039,800 points.
I have this on several systems like the NES.
There's actually a Game & Watch version.
The NES version was the launch title in Japan.
We've got it on a virtual console.
There was an e-reader card.
It was in Animal Crossing.
So yeah, it's a pretty classic.
This is one of the few Nintendo games I actually had.
There was a combo pack that came out on the NES back in the day that was like both Donkey Kong Jr.
games, and I had that actually.
It was one of the first Nintendo games I had.
So, that's cool.
I play this on the Coleco.
Yeah?
It's old school.
You know what?
I actually kind of like this game better a little bit than Donkey Kong.
I don't know why.
I guess I just like the whole concept of the vine climbing and that you kind of go faster if you're willing to go across two, but you go really fast when you slide down.
It's interesting.
Alright, if nothing else to say on this game from DarkSakura, then that's going to do it for your classic game of the week, Donkey Kong Jr.
on just about every freaking system ever made, but originally in the arcade.
An old school Nintendo classic.
There you have it.
Alright, we are going to open up the Skype line just a little bit for any open bar topics you guys have.
1-877-GAME-OLR or username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
Anything goes right now.
Anything you want to ask or comment on, whether we've talked about it in the show or it's something you think we should have covered that we didn't, now is the time.
Loki, I don't know if... Oh wait, never mind, we're getting a call right now.
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
Who's this?
Hey, it's your local convention whore, DJ Ranma S. Hey, Ranma, are you calling in about a new convention tonight?
Yeah, pretty much.
Of course.
Well, which convention?
Anime Next.
And how was it?
Well...
If you've been following my Twitter blog, I've been like not feeling it, not feeling it because there's been delays, guests canceling.
But when I got there and got into the groove of things, it was fun and I really enjoyed myself this year.
I have to be honest.
I've kind of been off Twitter all weekend.
I've been so busy just running from place to place doing – well, it's nice.
I can't – it's nice having a social life.
But yeah, I've just been so busy.
I've kind of been off Twitter.
But I don't –
I know what you mean you know sometimes you're just kind of not in the mood but then you get there and it somehow all comes together like haven't you ever done that like there's been like a party and you don't really want to go but maybe there's like either a significant other or it's an important friend having the party or something you know yeah and you're just not feeling it but you're like all right I'm gonna go because I have to and maybe I'll stay for an hour then find an excuse to leave like I have severe diarrhea or something right but then you get there and you're like oh I'm actually having a good time and it just kind of seems to all come together like that
Yeah, that's how it was.
Yeah.
So, all right.
Well, what about, you know, we're a gaming show, so I always have to ask you, how was gaming representation at the con?
Was there good stuff there?
Yeah.
First of all, they had a room just for a rock band.
They had it projected onto a large wall, which was about 60 feet wide, pretty much.
Mm-hmm.
It was a dark room and I walked in and everybody was singing Living on a Prayer.
Is this rock band room something where people would just randomly walk in and watch people play rock band?
Yeah, I mean you would wait your turn to play but at the same time there was chairs so we could sit down and watch them play.
I bet you see a lot of great talent though.
Yes, definitely.
Sort of like an anime idol.
Something like that and also there was also a beta test for DJ Hero there.
Oh, really?
Yeah, really.
So, wait, so you actually got to play DJ Hero?
Yeah, it's called Beatmania 2DX.
Ba-dum-bum, nice.
Wait, hold on, though, Ranma.
As I said this in Part A, the games have nothing in common.
They really don't.
If you've got to make that comparison, Beatmania and Scratch.
But Beatmania and DJ Hero, no.
It doesn't work.
There are two games that happen to use a turntable.
They're so different.
Here's the thing though, I wasn't the one that made the joke because I walked in, I saw the sign, I run over to the other side of the game room because I know one of the guys over there, I'm like, what's up with DJ Hero?
He's like, no, it's 2DX dude, it's 2DX.
I'm like, haha, funny.
Oh, so they made the joke?
Uh-huh.
Well, please encourage them to go listen to Part A tonight because I have some pretty strong words for them.
I will, I definitely will alright Ranma, I gotta let you go to get more calls but thanks so much for your call and have fun on the anime circuit you got it
Let's see, I'm looking at, because the chat room is talking about Anime Next a little bit here.
Legend of Zaku says, Anime Next was pretty damn lackluster compared to previous years, although the venue kicked ass this year.
Osfer says, I can't wait until mid-July when I go to Otacon.
And Rob D is pimping his panel called Games That Push Your Buttons.
It is pretty funny, though, if you're going to Otacon, check that out.
Hi, you're on Orange Haunts Radio, who's this?
Legend of Zaku.
Zaku, I was just reading a comment of yours.
Is this a call about Anime Next, or what?
Yeah, I was there that weekend.
And?
Even though I didn't room with Adam this year, but I managed to find enough cash to go and split a room with someone else.
Even though it wasn't far from the venue, but I still managed to make it regardless.
Just to touch up on what he briefly said, I kind of had a different experience this year in Anime Next.
I mean, the venue kicked severe ass.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
I'd have been, you know, wasn't what I expected, but whatever.
I guess we'll try for the next year.
What was missing for you?
Was the game room lacking or what?
No, the game room was fine.
That had nothing to do with it.
It's just like, it wasn't, I don't know, for some reason, I wasn't really getting into some of the other panels.
I see.
Like, when I first went to Anime Next two years ago, I was really getting into an Adult Swim panel that I got in there and maybe a couple of Anime...
But I wasn't feeling it this year, unfortunately.
Do not let your friend host a panel because they are your friend.
Unless that friend is able to produce and outline ideas like everyone should have to, knock it off.
You're ruining your own con.
There was a particular one that I wanted to go to, but it had to do with Bomani stuff.
It was actually on Friday, but by the time I made it there, I had to take my roommate to the hotel and check it in.
and GetFood, so I pretty much missed it by the time I got there.
What exactly are those Bomani panels like these days?
Damn, we're in trouble.
I have no idea, but it was held on Friday evening, and I managed to arrive in the con at that time to get my badge, so it was a new award then.
They were nice enough to let me sit in on the BomaniStyle.com panel at ASEN.
And, you know, as cool as it was to be sitting with some of those folks, I really didn't feel like there was a lot to talk about.
A lot of the discussions focused around the concert that had happened the night before, which is cool for the folks that are into that type of music.
I felt really lost or what have you because I haven't been following a lot of the new Bomani games.
But when it came to actual talk on the Bomani games, like half of it was a joke.
Right.
Anyway.
Most of it, for, you know, I...
Even though I wasn't actually there in Ace, and I could only imagine it's probably like insider info, probably like inside jokes, something that would... A lot of inside jokes.
You had it anyways a minute ago, Zaku.
Please go ahead with your anyways.
Anyways, I would...
DDRX apparently hit arcades last week, the first one being Gameworks in Chicago that managed to get the first new cabinet in the country.
And from the initial reviews, horrible.
Let's just put it this way, the fact that the cabinet itself managed to go down to $10,000 as opposed to $15,000 in previous releases, they pretty much cut many corners, noticeable corners.
Laggy LCD monitor, a pad that's like half the thickness of the original one, the sensors in the arrows are pretty much
They're just triggering or not even holding, just triggering spontaneously or not holding at all.
Just a lot of bullshit on the part of maybe Betzen or Konami for that matter, just producing piss for new cabinets.
You know what?
I'm not surprised.
Go back to last week's show.
As far as I'm concerned, wheel that machine out to the barn and put a bullet in it.
It's done.
Yeah, at this point, people are just writing DDRX off at this point.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
I'm sadly not surprised.
Zaku, we gotta let you go so we can wrap up the show, but thanks so much for calling in.
Alright, take care.
They're a little fatter, too, and nobody likes fat.
Is it just me, or does it sound like, and we're gonna turn off the Skype for tonight so we can wrap up the show, but thank you guys so much.
And if you didn't get in, remember, you can always send us an email, mailbag at orangelaundry.com.
We do want your voice to be heard.
Thanks for watching!
Thought I would say this seven years ago when this whole show started.
And yes, we're coming up on our seven-year anniversary show in two weeks, believe it or not.
This first show is June 23, 2002.
I never thought I would say this seven years ago, but we've talked too much about DDR the past two shows.
Like, that's how relevant it is right now in this world.
We could bring it back.
I could bring it back.
They just didn't put the confidence in me.
No, it's not going to happen.
No, it would happen.
Sorry, Loki.
It would.
It would.
But it's not going to.
It could.
Yes, it could.
All right.
We've got to go around and get everybody's final thought and wrap up the show tonight and take care of it.
Oh, did you have any other last things you want to throw out there?
We didn't even talk release dates.
Oh, my God.
We didn't.
Do we want to go over those real quick?
We could do that.
That's what happens when you try a new format is that you forget shit.
All right.
Well, then, Loki, why don't you go over some release dates for the U.S.
before we wrap it up?
Alright, well this week we've got quite a few games coming out, but some that you probably want to pick up, Ghostbusters, coming out on PlayStation 2, 3, Xbox 360, Wii, DS, and PS, maybe the PSP, yeah.
That's right, not the PSP.
Let's see.
Big League Sports Summer coming out on Wii and DS.
Flower, Sun, and Rain, if you're a fan of the Killer7 and those types of games, but Grasshopper doing this one on DS.
It's weird.
I actually played the import of the European one, and it's kind of weird.
Guitar Hero Smash Hits coming out on PlayStation 2, 3, Xbox 360, and the Wii.
um if you're into more of the sim games Discovery Kids Parrot Pals and Diva Girls Divas on Ice on Wii and the DS um Monster Hunter Freedom Unite on PSP that's gonna be pretty awesome and that's pretty much it
Japan's looking a little thin on the releases this week, but you do get a price drop on Metal Gear Solid 4 Guns of the Patriots on June 18th on the PlayStation 3.
Remember, this is Japanese release dates I am reading right now.
Sometimes they get cool stuff before we do, but right now they're not getting a lot.
There isn't a single thing of note coming out on the Wii this week, believe it or not.
And usually in Japan, even on a slow week, you have something coming out on the Wii this
on the Playstation 2 you have a couple other price drops going on and mostly they are Neo Geo games like King of Fighters, Maximum Impact, Regulation A Metal Slug Complete, Samurai Spirits all of those games are getting price reductions and perhaps this is in preparation for the Sunsoft collection which is also coming out I think that's actually another price drop though they all get price drop, price drop, price drop this week over in Japan
On the Nintendo DS, there is a Go!
Go!
13 game coming out, believe it or not.
Remember that?
That was an old-school anime game that was on the NES.
I remember we could make a moonwalk.
That was funny.
That's right.
They have a new one of those games coming out on the DS this week, as well as Nippon Golfers Kentai DS comes out as well, and some games from Level 5.
I'm not sure exactly if these are games we know over here, but Tago Akira no Atama no Taisu, Dai Wanshu, Nazotoki Sekai Isshu Ryoku comes out this week.
I heard head.
Head.
I think this is... It looks like some type of... You play in a hotel?
Pirate ships?
Pirate ship hotel.
Looks like you're in a hotel or something.
DarkSakura's going to take a look at the name here.
Professor Layton.
Oh!
Yeah, see?
Leighton Kojo.
Oh, okay.
It's Professor Leighton Games.
New ones in Japan.
There's two.
Volume 1 and Volume 2.
Yeah.
Okay, now I see it.
Because you were clicking on the pictures for the Leighton games.
Oh, now I see it.
Okay.
It's brain training.
Yep, yep.
All right.
There you go, new Professor Layton games coming out on DS over there in Japan.
And quickly looking at the PSP, Fate Unlimited Codes Portable comes out this week from Capcom on the PSP.
Dan is making arrangements for us, potentially.
Yeah, I'm hearing we might move to where the pinball machines are now.
He was giving me a little tour earlier.
Yeah, the pinballs have to go to the garage.
We might bump the pinball machines for the show.
Could be interesting.
But we did trade creatures from the Black Lagoon for Lord of the Rings.
And Tan broke it already.
I miss not having to commute, but...
I guess if you guys have done it for so long I can do it for a little while at least.
How about our European releases?
How about it?
On the 16th we have Wallace and Gromit's Grand Adventures Muzzled for PC.
And on the 17th we have Rocket Riot, which kind of sounds a little dirty to me.
The 18th Metal Gear Solid on PlayStation 3.
And then the 19th we have Rock Band Unplugged, Virtua Tennis 2009, and Ghostbusters.
Ghostbusters by the way I really like that infamous game really?
yeah somebody was just asking a little while ago why we don't talk about it on the show I haven't played much of it just because I've had a whole lot going on you know but it's totally like between the guy coasting through the air with electricity and then being Spiderman it's kind of funny meets the guy from Crackdown I'm glad you said something about it I hope the listener who sent in that email listens to the end of the show so there you go
All right, Loki, you had some other stories you wanted to get to.
Yes.
Well, what game out there could possibly create a peripheral that is 20 times more expensive than the game itself?
Well, that game, of course, would be Virtualon.
They do have a $300 arcade stick that you can get for the Xbox 360 version.
It is from Hori, and yes, it is 20 times the cost of the game, which is only $15.
but it does have the twin sticks and you can go crazy with that I wonder if you know how they have those little converter units where you could use like a Playstation controller on the Xbox 360 you know the different ones you'd have to remap them and everything I wonder if there wouldn't be some type of converter that they could make where I could use my Dreamcast sticks I don't know then again I can just play it on Dreamcast
This is going to sound so random, but I have to say something.
I just realized you're wearing a DDRspot.com shirt.
Yes, I am.
That is fucking old school.
You know when I got this shirt?
Yeah.
I got this shirt at March Madness.
That shirt has to be as old as this show.
I threw away the other day my DDR Mania X shirt I still have two DDR Freak shirts left too But now keep in mind, this is the thing, remember when I got this, it fit me?
This is a 2XL.
It's pajamas now.
That's a sleepy shirt now.
Yeah.
Well, good for you.
It's a shirt I can wear without a bra.
Well, thanks for sharing.
Okay, Loki, sorry.
Well, with the news of Left 4 Dead 2 possibly dividing the community, maybe this will bring the community back together.
Left 4 Dead has finally got a nude Zoe mod for PC version.
Yes, that's right.
I read that.
What game out there with a female character would not be complete without a nude mod?
I think we can all agree on that.
The nudity mods are a must.
And that's available on L4Dmods.com.
I gotta love this stuff.
Nudity brings us together.
Yes.
Let's see here.
Apparently...
Final Fantasy Tactics has been rated by the ESRB and people believe it's coming to the PlayStation Network sounds about right to me nice holy crap nice I've been so jonesing for the old school Final Fantasy Tactics like before it was on DS and all the other ones I really want to play like on my TV again Final Fantasy Tactics oh happy happy Rob
PSP GO Apps and Small Games at Gamescom
and these are supposed to be of course non-retail games and applications for the PSP and the file sizes are said to be limited to 100 megabytes but developers and publishers won't be limited in other creative ways Sony is said to have some specifically stated non-game apps and 2D tiles are more than welcome make your comparisons to iPhone now yes
I don't want to report on this, but apparently there is another teaser site in Japan now for a brand new Tingle game.
And I weep with sadness.
I weep tears of joy.
Thank you for reporting that, Loki.
Alright, is that it?
And finally, Nintendo apparently has, according to Guardian Media Technologies, was one of the patent lawsuits that Nintendo had to deal with.
Well, it's been thrown out of court.
We are very pleased with the court's decision and Nintendo vigorously defends its patent lawsuits and at the earliest stages of this case Nintendo convinced the court to dismiss the case as Guardian's patent had nothing to do with Nintendo's products.
Well, despite all the crap I give Nintendo, I think I agree with them here.
There's too many of these frivolous patent lawsuits.
Well, here's the thing.
If there's a patent lawsuit that's out there, and they find that they have infringed on that patent, then how could there be multiple lawsuits later on for the same types of things?
Because I think in that case, well, you've already found that you've been infringing on this patent, and you need to go after that person, because that's the person that has the patent for it, not Nintendo.
And that's it.
All right.
Well, that's going to do it here for another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
We need to get everybody's final thought.
My God, the show just keeps going tonight.
Three hours and counting.
Loki, your final thought tonight.
I'm going to have to play some more Fuel, and then I'll have to play with you online with Fuel.
My final thought is I am so down.
Just let me know when.
That'll be fun.
All right.
Dark Sakura.
I don't think a miracle from God could make Star Trek V a good movie.
You do know they're on Star Trek X at this point, right?
I know, but I was going back and reading 20 facts about Star Trek 10 from TrekMovie.com, which I will post in chat.
Hey, but it did have the fan dance.
Anyhow, that's going to do it for another week here at Orange Lounge Radio.
Hey, if you like what we do here for free every week of the last seven years of our lives, all we ask, tell a couple people about the show.
Help spread the word.
It's word of mouth that keeps us alive.
Thank you guys so much for tuning into us and supporting us.
And we'll see you back here next week with more of Orange Lounge Radio and back here in two weeks for our seventh anniversary.
And I don't know if we're doing anything special for the seventh anniversary because the planning would have been... Is it really?
Two weeks is our seventh anniversary.
to technically it falls in between next week and the next Sunday.
But you know what?
I have my next assessment.
You know what?
I'm going to actually email the teacher and ask if I can go do the assessment earlier in the day.
That might be a good idea.
I don't know if we'll do anything special.
It's just, you know, we always try to do something special for the anniversary shows and nothing ever really happens.
Let's explode things.
All right.
We want to explode things live on air and be fun.
Alright, well we'll see what happens.
We'll be back next week with more Orange Lounge Radio.
Until then, bye guys!
