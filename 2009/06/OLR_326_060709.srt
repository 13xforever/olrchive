1
00:00:14,175 --> 00:00:15,996
[SPEAKER_09]: and I, June 7th, 2009.

2
00:00:16,317 --> 00:00:23,101
[SPEAKER_09]: We're all here in studio with your phone calls and chat romantics to discuss this year's highs and lows of E3.

3
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:32,440
[SPEAKER_13]: DarkSakura, Jamie Summers

4
00:00:52,825 --> 00:00:54,006
[SPEAKER_05]: I am doing okay.

5
00:00:54,266 --> 00:00:58,089
[SPEAKER_13]: I was a little worried you weren't going to be here tonight at first, but things pulled through and now you're here.

6
00:00:58,469 --> 00:01:02,412
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought that I had a school orientation, and it turns out that I don't.

7
00:01:02,972 --> 00:01:03,933
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, that's a good thing though, right?

8
00:01:04,133 --> 00:01:05,114
[SPEAKER_05]: That means I have it next week.

9
00:01:05,294 --> 00:01:06,635
[SPEAKER_13]: Now you can sit here and party with us.

10
00:01:07,295 --> 00:01:08,876
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep, it's all parties all the time.

11
00:01:09,077 --> 00:01:10,658
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright, or you can play Sims 3.

12
00:01:10,718 --> 00:01:13,320
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, I can do both at the same time.

13
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:13,920
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright, no, that's fine.

14
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:16,742
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright, also say hello to the one and only Techmaster Loki.

15
00:01:17,022 --> 00:01:17,222
[SPEAKER_13]: Hello.

16
00:01:17,242 --> 00:01:17,623
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright.

17
00:01:17,643 --> 00:01:17,943
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright.

18
00:01:18,954 --> 00:01:21,097
[SPEAKER_13]: Loki's able to do the show and look at porn at the same time.

19
00:01:21,137 --> 00:01:21,638
[SPEAKER_13]: It's amazing.

20
00:01:21,778 --> 00:01:22,779
[SPEAKER_13]: No, I'm just kidding.

21
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:23,881
[SPEAKER_13]: Are you looking at porn?

22
00:01:24,041 --> 00:01:28,827
[SPEAKER_14]: Although my wife is adding bookmarks for porn on my computer, I like to add.

23
00:01:29,648 --> 00:01:29,969
[SPEAKER_13]: Nice.

24
00:01:31,130 --> 00:01:32,132
[SPEAKER_13]: How very thoughtful of her.

25
00:01:33,952 --> 00:01:35,653
[SPEAKER_13]: All right, well, how you doing today, Loki?

26
00:01:35,693 --> 00:01:37,174
[SPEAKER_13]: You just got back from L.A.

27
00:01:37,194 --> 00:01:37,635
[SPEAKER_13]: today, right?

28
00:01:37,655 --> 00:01:39,396
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, like four hours ago.

29
00:01:39,916 --> 00:01:44,539
[SPEAKER_13]: Most people leave E3 like Friday, but you stayed over till today to do stuff with the wife.

30
00:01:44,659 --> 00:01:49,682
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, and that reminds me, she wanted me to add a few things about E3.

31
00:01:49,743 --> 00:01:50,243
[SPEAKER_14]: She says...

32
00:01:50,803 --> 00:02:16,368
[SPEAKER_14]: E3 sucked because she had to stay in a hotel room and because the people in the hotel room had open wifi but for whatever reason she couldn't connect to them so she couldn't download the porn fast enough and then she was also pissed off at my computer because it didn't have Yahoo Instant Messenger installed on it anymore that's because a Windows update crashed and I had to reinstall the whole thing so that's her complaint oh and Universal sucks

33
00:02:17,808 --> 00:02:20,769
[SPEAKER_14]: Universal Studios Universal Studios Universal Studios Universal Studios

34
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:48,981
[SPEAKER_13]: Circling of the Trims.

35
00:02:49,041 --> 00:02:50,322
[SPEAKER_13]: The Mario thing was later in the week.

36
00:02:50,342 --> 00:02:51,242
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, he took over.

37
00:02:51,262 --> 00:02:52,183
[SPEAKER_13]: Maybe it was the second night.

38
00:02:52,203 --> 00:02:52,463
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know.

39
00:02:52,503 --> 00:02:54,684
[SPEAKER_13]: I actually watched every night of Conan O'Brien.

40
00:02:54,784 --> 00:02:58,066
[SPEAKER_14]: I saw the sign to go in there and I was like, oh, I want to go in there.

41
00:02:58,206 --> 00:02:58,886
[SPEAKER_14]: But we couldn't.

42
00:02:59,286 --> 00:03:00,687
[SPEAKER_13]: What day were you at Universal Studios?

43
00:03:00,707 --> 00:03:02,448
[SPEAKER_14]: We were there Thursday afternoon.

44
00:03:02,488 --> 00:03:03,328
[SPEAKER_13]: We went there Friday.

45
00:03:03,469 --> 00:03:05,450
[SPEAKER_13]: It's like we kept missing each other the next few days.

46
00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:05,870
[SPEAKER_13]: That's all right.

47
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:07,691
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, yeah.

48
00:03:08,211 --> 00:03:09,392
[SPEAKER_14]: Universal Studios sucks.

49
00:03:10,352 --> 00:03:10,852
[SPEAKER_13]: Sorry to hear that.

50
00:03:10,872 --> 00:03:11,493
[SPEAKER_13]: I've never been there.

51
00:03:11,573 --> 00:03:12,213
[SPEAKER_13]: I've never been there.

52
00:03:13,353 --> 00:03:15,874
[SPEAKER_13]: I thought they had like a Jurassic Park ride and a Simpsons ride.

53
00:03:15,914 --> 00:03:17,775
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, that a pregnant woman can't ride.

54
00:03:18,255 --> 00:03:18,395
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh.

55
00:03:18,555 --> 00:03:21,296
[SPEAKER_14]: And the Simpsons ride, pregnant people can't ride that either.

56
00:03:21,416 --> 00:03:22,757
[SPEAKER_14]: Pregnant women can't ride a lot.

57
00:03:22,817 --> 00:03:23,557
[SPEAKER_14]: I hate to break it to you.

58
00:03:23,697 --> 00:03:28,479
[SPEAKER_13]: I know, but, you know... Violent motions shaking around your belly are not good for twins.

59
00:03:28,559 --> 00:03:32,441
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, but beside that, though, I mean, they really only have four rides.

60
00:03:32,461 --> 00:03:36,122
[SPEAKER_14]: They have the Jurassic Park ride, the Mummy Returns ride, or whatever.

61
00:03:36,142 --> 00:03:37,883
[SPEAKER_14]: They have the Simpsons ride...

62
00:03:40,068 --> 00:03:56,856
[SPEAKER_14]: and there's maybe one other one I'm not sure but that's all they have at Great America or at not Great America Universal I mean come on for a theme park that's pretty shitty I mean my only bitch is that Universal CityWalk is extremely overpriced and by the way if you don't know what this is

63
00:03:57,416 --> 00:04:01,458
[SPEAKER_13]: LA, they have the Universal Compound right off 101 Freeway.

64
00:04:01,798 --> 00:04:05,719
[SPEAKER_13]: That's where Universal Studios is, where Conan O'Brien tapes his show now.

65
00:04:06,139 --> 00:04:08,100
[SPEAKER_13]: It's where they do a lot of special events.

66
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:10,821
[SPEAKER_13]: It's where the More Friends concert was a couple years ago.

67
00:04:11,161 --> 00:04:18,744
[SPEAKER_13]: Not Dear Friends, the one More Friends concert they did at E305 was there at the Amphitheater, I think.

68
00:04:19,384 --> 00:04:22,465
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, I think it was 05, because 04 was the first Dear Friends, 05 was More Friends.

69
00:04:22,885 --> 00:04:23,166
[SPEAKER_13]: And then...

70
00:04:24,747 --> 00:04:25,288
[SPEAKER_13]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

71
00:04:40,888 --> 00:04:43,131
[SPEAKER_13]: I know what you're talking about, but I don't remember what it's called.

72
00:04:43,191 --> 00:04:45,275
[SPEAKER_13]: I know someone in chat is going to yell it out in any minute.

73
00:04:45,295 --> 00:04:54,468
[SPEAKER_13]: Chat.OrangeLoungeRadio.com The one episode of that show I saw, they actually taped at Universal CityWalk, so a lot of people know what this place is, but it's extremely overpriced.

74
00:04:55,639 --> 00:04:56,039
[SPEAKER_13]: That's all.

75
00:04:56,099 --> 00:04:58,440
[SPEAKER_13]: But I guess, you know, you expect these types of things are going to be.

76
00:04:58,840 --> 00:04:59,681
[SPEAKER_13]: So, yeah.

77
00:05:00,221 --> 00:05:00,461
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

78
00:05:00,701 --> 00:05:02,982
[SPEAKER_13]: Anyhow, enough about theme park rides and so on.

79
00:05:03,022 --> 00:05:04,462
[SPEAKER_13]: We have a lot of ground we're going to cover tonight.

80
00:05:04,803 --> 00:05:05,763
[SPEAKER_13]: Here's the interesting thing.

81
00:05:06,223 --> 00:05:07,443
[SPEAKER_13]: And I want to say thank you.

82
00:05:07,504 --> 00:05:08,544
[SPEAKER_13]: Chat is now piping up.

83
00:05:08,604 --> 00:05:10,024
[SPEAKER_13]: Chase, Chase, Chase.

84
00:05:10,245 --> 00:05:10,965
[SPEAKER_13]: It's called Chase.

85
00:05:11,405 --> 00:05:11,645
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

86
00:05:12,045 --> 00:05:13,806
[SPEAKER_13]: So thank you, chatters.

87
00:05:14,946 --> 00:05:16,707
[SPEAKER_13]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

88
00:05:39,915 --> 00:05:42,217
[SPEAKER_13]: So we didn't end up having an outline at all.

89
00:05:42,697 --> 00:05:43,738
[SPEAKER_05]: My husband volunteered.

90
00:05:43,858 --> 00:05:44,299
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I know.

91
00:05:44,359 --> 00:05:44,919
[SPEAKER_05]: Dan volunteered.

92
00:05:44,939 --> 00:05:46,180
[SPEAKER_05]: I volunteered him for you.

93
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:49,723
[SPEAKER_13]: But Dan is not used to having to prepare anything.

94
00:05:49,783 --> 00:05:52,085
[SPEAKER_13]: Dan just comes in here, is funny, and leaves.

95
00:05:52,445 --> 00:05:53,847
[SPEAKER_13]: That's Dan's role in the show.

96
00:05:54,307 --> 00:05:55,088
[SPEAKER_13]: Sounds like my marriage.

97
00:05:57,748 --> 00:05:59,149
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm sure he'd be very happy to hear that.

98
00:05:59,249 --> 00:06:00,589
[SPEAKER_13]: Can we get him in here to comment on that?

99
00:06:00,609 --> 00:06:00,869
[SPEAKER_13]: No.

100
00:06:01,069 --> 00:06:01,329
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

101
00:06:01,890 --> 00:06:07,712
[SPEAKER_13]: So tonight we're just, we have no, I mean, I don't know when part A is going to end and part B is going to begin.

102
00:06:08,132 --> 00:06:09,733
[SPEAKER_13]: We just, we're winging it tonight.

103
00:06:09,873 --> 00:06:12,034
[SPEAKER_13]: But we know we have a lot of ground to cover with E3 News.

104
00:06:12,334 --> 00:06:13,694
[SPEAKER_13]: So I'm just warning everybody up front.

105
00:06:13,754 --> 00:06:16,495
[SPEAKER_13]: If the show feels a little weird tonight, it is.

106
00:06:16,895 --> 00:06:17,836
[SPEAKER_13]: So there you go.

107
00:06:18,516 --> 00:06:20,417
[SPEAKER_13]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

108
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:39,261
[SPEAKER_13]: It's tough.

109
00:06:39,461 --> 00:06:40,122
[SPEAKER_13]: You know what?

110
00:06:40,242 --> 00:06:45,170
[SPEAKER_13]: E3 was smaller than it was in 06 when they did the last big one.

111
00:06:45,510 --> 00:06:47,693
[SPEAKER_13]: But this is how I've been describing E3 to people.

112
00:06:48,174 --> 00:06:52,500
[SPEAKER_13]: It was E3 2006 with less Paris Hilton, and that's a great thing.

113
00:06:53,632 --> 00:06:54,633
[SPEAKER_05]: Booth Babes are not cheap.

114
00:07:18,983 --> 00:07:20,264
[SPEAKER_05]: It costs a lot for all that silicone

115
00:07:35,218 --> 00:07:52,292
[SPEAKER_13]: and some companies like Nyko is the one that comes to mind the ones that have the big inflatable Wii controllers they did have some booth babes Nintendo had their I want a big inflatable Wii controller Nintendo didn't have booth babes but they had the educated good looking women that were showing off they just weren't dressed cheaply

116
00:07:54,674 --> 00:07:57,315
[SPEAKER_13]: and a couple, I mean, I'm not saying there weren't any Booth Babes anywhere.

117
00:07:57,335 --> 00:07:58,596
[SPEAKER_13]: There were the Trauma Center Babes.

118
00:07:58,796 --> 00:08:02,118
[SPEAKER_13]: I think one of the Capcom games or something had some Booth Babes.

119
00:08:02,378 --> 00:08:05,279
[SPEAKER_13]: There just were way less than I saw at E3 2006.

120
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:07,581
[SPEAKER_13]: And I, in part, blame the economy.

121
00:08:08,001 --> 00:08:09,041
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't see that as a bad thing.

122
00:08:09,261 --> 00:08:12,023
[SPEAKER_13]: I think the economy cut back on a lot of those types of things this year.

123
00:08:12,563 --> 00:08:13,784
[SPEAKER_05]: Less silicone, more games.

124
00:08:13,884 --> 00:08:16,986
[SPEAKER_13]: And zero booth studs that I saw.

125
00:08:17,006 --> 00:08:18,107
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, now that's a travesty.

126
00:08:18,167 --> 00:08:19,868
[SPEAKER_13]: That is a huge travesty.

127
00:08:19,888 --> 00:08:20,248
[SPEAKER_13]: But anyway.

128
00:08:21,249 --> 00:08:22,590
[SPEAKER_05]: Equal, you know.

129
00:08:22,850 --> 00:08:24,171
[SPEAKER_13]: Equal opportunity, absolutely.

130
00:08:24,191 --> 00:08:24,632
[SPEAKER_05]: Equal representation.

131
00:08:24,652 --> 00:08:29,075
[SPEAKER_13]: There's more and more women going to E3 working and doing, you know, women play games.

132
00:08:29,095 --> 00:08:30,616
[SPEAKER_05]: Sometimes we want booth babes too.

133
00:08:30,636 --> 00:08:30,976
[SPEAKER_13]: Surprise.

134
00:08:31,857 --> 00:08:32,137
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

135
00:08:32,397 --> 00:08:36,640
[SPEAKER_13]: And, you know, I happen to be one of those guys who wouldn't mind seeing some of those booth studs.

136
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:39,342
[SPEAKER_13]: But I've learned to just accept that's not going to happen.

137
00:08:39,802 --> 00:08:40,223
[SPEAKER_13]: So whatever.

138
00:08:40,483 --> 00:08:42,064
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, it is fun harassing the booth babes, though.

139
00:08:43,213 --> 00:08:47,299
[SPEAKER_13]: Anyhow, let's get into your gaming week Besides E3, how was your gaming week?

140
00:08:48,184 --> 00:08:50,425
[SPEAKER_05]: I did what I'm doing right now.

141
00:08:50,965 --> 00:08:51,325
[SPEAKER_13]: Which is?

142
00:08:51,345 --> 00:08:52,046
[SPEAKER_13]: Playing Sims.

143
00:08:52,626 --> 00:08:54,306
[SPEAKER_13]: Now, not just old school Sims.

144
00:08:54,606 --> 00:08:55,907
[SPEAKER_13]: So you at least played a new game.

145
00:08:56,447 --> 00:08:56,867
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yes.

146
00:08:56,967 --> 00:09:08,031
[SPEAKER_05]: And we've actually had full reviews posted on it on the blog I contribute to that Tiara keeps at AvengersTower.com.

147
00:09:09,432 --> 00:09:10,432
[SPEAKER_05]: She reviewed the game itself.

148
00:09:10,492 --> 00:09:16,735
[SPEAKER_05]: I reviewed the exchange in the store and the house mechanics, which, you know me, I love building the houses.

149
00:09:17,575 --> 00:09:19,558
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm building the Avengers Mansion right now.

150
00:09:19,878 --> 00:09:21,080
[SPEAKER_13]: Also, give us a little synopsis.

151
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:24,684
[SPEAKER_13]: What makes this game special compared to previous installments in the franchise?

152
00:09:24,744 --> 00:09:27,308
[SPEAKER_05]: It's new, and really, that's not very special right now.

153
00:09:27,328 --> 00:09:30,231
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, a lot of the play in it is improved.

154
00:09:30,752 --> 00:09:32,655
[SPEAKER_05]: You can put diagonal...

155
00:09:33,135 --> 00:09:35,816
[SPEAKER_05]: Furniture and change a few things.

156
00:09:35,856 --> 00:09:37,577
[SPEAKER_05]: The build a house mode is a lot better.

157
00:09:38,597 --> 00:09:40,778
[SPEAKER_05]: You can definitely customize your body shapes a bit more.

158
00:09:40,818 --> 00:09:43,219
[SPEAKER_05]: But see, there's a problem is that the faces are butt ugly.

159
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:46,201
[SPEAKER_05]: And it takes a lot of adjustment to get them not butt ugly.

160
00:09:46,781 --> 00:09:47,761
[SPEAKER_05]: And they have no chins.

161
00:09:48,662 --> 00:09:51,383
[SPEAKER_05]: And what are all the other...

162
00:09:52,984 --> 00:09:53,924
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for watching!

163
00:10:16,196 --> 00:10:31,273
[SPEAKER_05]: and you can actually buy points to use in their store and they've got some neat stuff in the store but the only thing that I was actually super excited about was like a lamp and a bathtub because it was a really cool bathtub sounds like a trip to Ikea I want an Ikea pack

164
00:10:31,953 --> 00:10:33,714
[SPEAKER_05]: Sims 2 had Ikea packs.

165
00:10:34,035 --> 00:10:35,276
[SPEAKER_05]: I want an Ikea pack.

166
00:10:35,296 --> 00:10:35,776
[SPEAKER_13]: For real?

167
00:10:36,196 --> 00:10:36,636
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah!

168
00:10:36,857 --> 00:10:37,917
[SPEAKER_13]: There's a huge Sims culture.

169
00:10:37,937 --> 00:10:46,283
[SPEAKER_13]: I think a lot of times, you know, because our show, we try to touch on PC gaming, and I think we do to an extent, but I think, you know, I'll admit it, we stay pretty focused on consoles.

170
00:10:46,703 --> 00:10:51,987
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think sometimes, even the PC gamers, we neglect how huge the Sims franchise is.

171
00:10:52,567 --> 00:10:54,689
[SPEAKER_13]: Isn't the Sims, like, the best-selling PC game ever?

172
00:10:56,209 --> 00:10:57,150
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm pretty sure it is.

173
00:10:57,690 --> 00:10:59,611
[SPEAKER_13]: So there's this huge culture around it.

174
00:10:59,671 --> 00:11:02,732
[SPEAKER_13]: I would have never guessed, however, that there was actually Ikea packs for Sims 2.

175
00:11:02,932 --> 00:11:03,552
[SPEAKER_13]: That's hilarious.

176
00:11:03,652 --> 00:11:13,176
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I mean, the whole thing about The Sims is that, you know, especially through cheating, like me, you can have all kinds of neat stuff happen.

177
00:11:13,536 --> 00:11:14,317
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, for people...

178
00:11:15,317 --> 00:11:16,218
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

179
00:11:32,293 --> 00:11:33,713
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura.com

180
00:11:51,898 --> 00:11:54,999
[SPEAKER_13]: Now, speaking of exchange, I don't think Sims 2 had this.

181
00:11:55,119 --> 00:11:59,780
[SPEAKER_13]: This sounds more like what Spore had, where you can publish all your creations to the web, right?

182
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:01,201
[SPEAKER_05]: You could do it with Sims 2.

183
00:12:01,641 --> 00:12:19,326
[SPEAKER_05]: They had, you know, where you could post up your stuff, but you had to, of course, register your game, and really, they didn't have anything on there that you couldn't get anywhere else, you know, once the big mod forums came out, which, actually, I'll go ahead and plug my favorite right now, modthesims.com.

184
00:12:20,467 --> 00:12:25,902
[SPEAKER_13]: They're probably the best one out there So overall with Sims 3, all you were hoping for and more?

185
00:12:26,784 --> 00:12:31,285
[SPEAKER_05]: I really had very little in the way of expectation, so I like it.

186
00:12:31,665 --> 00:12:32,526
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not displeased with it.

187
00:12:32,566 --> 00:12:37,707
[SPEAKER_05]: I like that you can, if the floor or something is butt ugly, you can just change it.

188
00:12:38,807 --> 00:12:48,370
[SPEAKER_05]: You can actually go in, in any of the floors that you lay down, you can actually go back in and change the color of them.

189
00:12:49,190 --> 00:12:52,011
[SPEAKER_05]: This little tool that I have here is a palette tool.

190
00:12:52,891 --> 00:13:07,007
[SPEAKER_05]: and you can go in if it will let me and actually change the various colors in it by sliding the little slider and it'll change all the colors and then you can just copy that one and paste it all over the place.

191
00:13:07,267 --> 00:13:07,848
[SPEAKER_05]: It's really neat.

192
00:13:07,948 --> 00:13:09,309
[SPEAKER_05]: I've done a few custom floors myself.

193
00:13:10,110 --> 00:13:10,991
[SPEAKER_13]: Reading some chat comments.

194
00:13:11,031 --> 00:13:15,694
[SPEAKER_13]: Chat.OrangeLawnRadio.com Decipher is in chat and wants to clarify Sims 2 had it.

195
00:13:16,054 --> 00:13:19,396
[SPEAKER_13]: It just wasn't as intuitive, I believe, talking about the whole web interface.

196
00:13:19,536 --> 00:13:21,578
[SPEAKER_05]: This is actually super easy.

197
00:13:22,058 --> 00:13:24,840
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, um... Oh, come on, you butthead.

198
00:13:27,123 --> 00:13:29,705
[SPEAKER_05]: I talk to my games all the time, that's right.

199
00:13:31,186 --> 00:13:35,189
[SPEAKER_05]: For example, I'm just going to show you with a piece of furniture.

200
00:13:36,310 --> 00:13:40,533
[SPEAKER_05]: Say that I put this stupidly ugly bed...

201
00:13:41,694 --> 00:13:42,075
[SPEAKER_05]: Right here.

202
00:13:43,015 --> 00:13:46,058
[SPEAKER_05]: And I hate that this stupidly ugly bed is stupidly ugly.

203
00:13:46,558 --> 00:13:47,479
[SPEAKER_05]: So I want to change it.

204
00:13:47,599 --> 00:13:50,362
[SPEAKER_05]: So I hit my little palette thing.

205
00:13:50,442 --> 00:13:51,643
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh my god, it is an ugly bed.

206
00:13:53,184 --> 00:13:57,328
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I can go through and say, you know what, I really hate this rose pattern thing.

207
00:13:58,148 --> 00:14:00,150
[SPEAKER_05]: I want this leaf pattern instead.

208
00:14:00,711 --> 00:14:04,134
[SPEAKER_05]: So I can pick the leaf pattern as soon as all this other crap loads.

209
00:14:05,236 --> 00:14:12,212
[SPEAKER_05]: and my computer's a little taxed of course because I have everything running for the show but it will change the bedspread to

210
00:14:15,579 --> 00:14:19,142
[SPEAKER_13]: It seems to me that you play Sims really for the design element.

211
00:14:19,182 --> 00:14:20,683
[SPEAKER_13]: You really like to design the houses.

212
00:14:20,723 --> 00:14:23,305
[SPEAKER_13]: You like to design the furniture and color every little piece.

213
00:14:23,905 --> 00:14:24,846
[SPEAKER_13]: Is there stuff there?

214
00:14:24,866 --> 00:14:26,127
[SPEAKER_13]: Because I suck at designing.

215
00:14:26,167 --> 00:14:27,488
[SPEAKER_13]: Is there something in this game for me?

216
00:14:27,608 --> 00:14:28,909
[SPEAKER_13]: Is there actual game to play?

217
00:14:29,029 --> 00:14:30,811
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you can just pick a house.

218
00:14:31,391 --> 00:14:33,413
[SPEAKER_05]: You can download houses that other people have done.

219
00:14:33,833 --> 00:14:35,535
[SPEAKER_14]: After you've murdered the family.

220
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:40,342
[SPEAKER_05]: No, you have empty lots and you can evict people.

221
00:14:40,782 --> 00:14:43,484
[SPEAKER_05]: And right now it's still thinking about changing that bedspread to green.

222
00:14:43,884 --> 00:14:47,066
[SPEAKER_05]: But what would happen is I would save it here and then I would pick share.

223
00:14:48,106 --> 00:14:52,569
[SPEAKER_05]: And then when I go in, you have this other thing that's called the launcher.

224
00:14:53,666 --> 00:14:55,427
[SPEAKER_05]: which is the first thing that loads up when you play the game.

225
00:14:55,447 --> 00:14:56,528
[SPEAKER_14]: Does that launch Sims?

226
00:14:58,229 --> 00:14:59,010
[SPEAKER_14]: Out of a cannon.

227
00:14:59,070 --> 00:15:01,492
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, it's modthesims.info by the way.

228
00:15:03,353 --> 00:15:04,935
[SPEAKER_05]: The site.

229
00:15:05,255 --> 00:15:15,102
[SPEAKER_05]: But then you go into this and you can actually, those are screenshots up there, but you can select that one of the items that you've saved specifically for sharing and click upload.

230
00:15:15,803 --> 00:15:22,468
[SPEAKER_05]: And almost instantly it's on the exchange for you and everybody else in the universe to see all the crap that you've managed to make.

231
00:15:22,688 --> 00:15:25,751
[SPEAKER_13]: And again, kind of like Spores Creature Creator kind of reminds me of that.

232
00:15:25,891 --> 00:15:27,432
[SPEAKER_05]: And of course, everything that you've picked for download.

233
00:15:27,472 --> 00:15:32,456
[SPEAKER_05]: And this also works now for the content that's up on Mod the Sims right now.

234
00:15:33,037 --> 00:15:37,801
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that you just click on the little pack and it loads it into this and you can choose to install it in your game.

235
00:15:38,821 --> 00:15:39,382
[SPEAKER_05]: It's pretty neat.

236
00:15:39,762 --> 00:15:40,503
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's pretty neat.

237
00:15:40,983 --> 00:15:41,304
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

238
00:15:41,404 --> 00:15:42,945
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, maybe I'll have to check that out a little later.

239
00:15:44,266 --> 00:15:44,706
[SPEAKER_05]: It's worth it.

240
00:15:44,786 --> 00:15:45,467
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's worthwhile.

241
00:15:45,827 --> 00:15:47,929
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, let's move on and talk about more gaming weeks.

242
00:15:48,129 --> 00:15:48,590
[SPEAKER_13]: It changed.

243
00:15:49,942 --> 00:15:51,283
[SPEAKER_13]: Finally, it changed to that green pattern.

244
00:15:51,363 --> 00:15:51,944
[SPEAKER_05]: It's camo.

245
00:15:52,724 --> 00:15:56,987
[SPEAKER_13]: Loki, besides the stuff you played at E3, because we'll have plenty of time for that in a little bit, how was your gaming week?

246
00:15:57,628 --> 00:15:59,969
[SPEAKER_14]: I played Fuel, more Fuel at least.

247
00:16:00,209 --> 00:16:01,710
[SPEAKER_14]: It was fun.

248
00:16:02,451 --> 00:16:06,774
[SPEAKER_14]: Still driving around, trying to get more stuff unlocked.

249
00:16:07,634 --> 00:16:12,718
[SPEAKER_14]: Really just trying to drive around and collect more Fuel containers to unlock more cars.

250
00:16:14,699 --> 00:16:15,540
[SPEAKER_14]: Man, that game is big.

251
00:16:17,293 --> 00:16:20,576
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm going to spend one of these days actually just trying to drive across the whole map.

252
00:16:21,437 --> 00:16:22,638
[SPEAKER_14]: But it probably will take a whole day.

253
00:16:23,919 --> 00:16:24,839
[SPEAKER_13]: Because it's that big.

254
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:30,764
[SPEAKER_13]: It seems... I'm looking at some of the reviews for that game because I'm considering picking it up.

255
00:16:30,804 --> 00:16:32,686
[SPEAKER_13]: It seems like it's getting very average reviews.

256
00:16:32,926 --> 00:16:36,189
[SPEAKER_13]: People don't think, I guess, the implementation is good or something.

257
00:16:36,229 --> 00:16:37,890
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know what people's problems is with it.

258
00:16:38,050 --> 00:16:38,571
[SPEAKER_13]: It's alright.

259
00:16:38,591 --> 00:16:39,952
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know.

260
00:16:40,633 --> 00:16:41,633
[SPEAKER_14]: There's nothing really like it.

261
00:16:41,653 --> 00:16:41,713
[SPEAKER_14]: And...

262
00:16:45,743 --> 00:16:47,805
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know, probably the next racing game similar to it.

263
00:16:47,825 --> 00:16:51,829
[SPEAKER_14]: It's going to be Dirt 2 and that's not out until September.

264
00:16:53,191 --> 00:17:00,118
[SPEAKER_14]: Actually, there's no real racing games I think coming out until September other than Fuel, which has already come out.

265
00:17:00,979 --> 00:17:02,861
[SPEAKER_14]: So, yeah.

266
00:17:03,326 --> 00:17:03,787
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know.

267
00:17:04,548 --> 00:17:06,550
[SPEAKER_13]: Anything else besides the E3 stuff?

268
00:17:06,770 --> 00:17:07,451
[SPEAKER_13]: More Grand Theft Auto 4.

269
00:17:07,491 --> 00:17:08,612
[SPEAKER_13]: That's about it.

270
00:17:08,972 --> 00:17:09,293
[SPEAKER_13]: Of course.

271
00:17:10,474 --> 00:17:22,807
[SPEAKER_13]: My gaming week, obviously with E3 kind of being this week, there wasn't a whole lot I played outside of E3, but I will tell you, once I got home, one of the first things I wanted to do... Well, I did play a little bit of Final Fantasy XI, because I mentioned in a previous show I'd gone back to it.

272
00:17:22,828 --> 00:17:23,969
[SPEAKER_13]: I haven't played a whole lot...

273
00:17:24,289 --> 00:17:24,809
[SPEAKER_13]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

274
00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:49,000
[SPEAKER_13]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

275
00:18:11,045 --> 00:18:11,686
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh crap!

276
00:18:12,046 --> 00:18:14,588
[SPEAKER_13]: Final Fantasy 4 The After Years came out this week.

277
00:18:14,748 --> 00:18:19,691
[SPEAKER_13]: I have got to go play that because Final Fantasy 4 is like my favorite Final Fantasy ever.

278
00:18:19,731 --> 00:18:23,814
[SPEAKER_13]: At least the one I have the most nostalgia with.

279
00:18:24,134 --> 00:18:28,357
[SPEAKER_13]: Because that was my first real in-depth Final Fantasy game that I just got totally immersed with.

280
00:18:28,377 --> 00:18:32,740
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean I remember playing the very first one on the NES when I was like 9 or 10 years old.

281
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:33,701
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't even remember how old I was.

282
00:18:34,061 --> 00:18:36,723
[SPEAKER_13]: But I remember playing that very first one on the NES and it was cool.

283
00:18:37,183 --> 00:18:37,663
[SPEAKER_13]: But um...

284
00:18:38,784 --> 00:18:43,785
[SPEAKER_13]: I didn't really get immersed until Final Fantasy 2 here in the US, which as we all know is really 4.

285
00:18:44,606 --> 00:18:49,887
[SPEAKER_13]: So finally, I'm very excited to hear the sequel came out and it's on cell phones.

286
00:18:50,227 --> 00:18:58,049
[SPEAKER_13]: So I checked out Final Fantasy 4 The After Years on the Wii and yeah, my nostalgia strings were successfully tugged.

287
00:18:58,609 --> 00:19:01,010
[SPEAKER_13]: I was kind of surprised at how...

288
00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:03,441
[SPEAKER_13]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

289
00:19:24,492 --> 00:19:28,533
[SPEAKER_13]: But, of course, I had to remind myself, okay, Rob, you are playing a port of a cell phone game.

290
00:19:28,613 --> 00:19:34,475
[SPEAKER_13]: So, I mean, I guess if I could compare it to anything, it would be very similar to playing, like, Final Fantasy IV on Game Boy Advance or WonderSwan Color.

291
00:19:34,795 --> 00:19:38,657
[SPEAKER_13]: Like, you know, that kind of, like, slightly souped-up upgrade from the original Super Nintendo one.

292
00:19:40,891 --> 00:19:41,051
[SPEAKER_13]: Ghosts!

293
00:19:56,244 --> 00:20:01,846
[SPEAKER_13]: If you want to get the seven other episodes with the spinoff characters, they're like 300 Wii points each.

294
00:20:01,926 --> 00:20:04,667
[SPEAKER_13]: And then the final chapter is supposed to be another 800 points.

295
00:20:05,107 --> 00:20:07,347
[SPEAKER_13]: But I guess they're rolling this out slowly.

296
00:20:07,388 --> 00:20:09,468
[SPEAKER_13]: Like there's a side story on Rydia out now.

297
00:20:09,568 --> 00:20:10,669
[SPEAKER_13]: I haven't really played it yet.

298
00:20:10,909 --> 00:20:11,769
[SPEAKER_13]: I plan to, though.

299
00:20:12,809 --> 00:20:19,471
[SPEAKER_13]: And then once you complete all these side stories, you can use the characters from the side stories in the closing chapter is what I hear is supposed to happen.

300
00:20:19,931 --> 00:20:21,112
[SPEAKER_13]: So, I mean, that's kind of cool.

301
00:20:21,972 --> 00:20:22,832
[SPEAKER_13]: Here's the thing.

302
00:20:23,292 --> 00:20:27,854
[SPEAKER_13]: It plays and feels like Final Fantasy IV on the Super Nintendo, not on the DS.

303
00:20:27,914 --> 00:20:28,934
[SPEAKER_13]: No voice acting, nothing.

304
00:20:28,974 --> 00:20:30,095
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, it plays and feels.

305
00:20:30,375 --> 00:20:46,380
[SPEAKER_13]: So if you want an old-school Super Nintendo RPG, if that's what you've been clamoring for, if that's what you miss, much like Mega Man 9 appealed to you because you missed the old-school NES Mega Man games, then you will like Final Fantasy IV The After Years.

306
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:47,480
[SPEAKER_13]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

307
00:21:04,505 --> 00:21:07,246
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a fairly well written story, at least what I've gotten into so far.

308
00:21:07,946 --> 00:21:11,948
[SPEAKER_13]: Just playing it all over again is kind of making me giddy.

309
00:21:12,368 --> 00:21:15,510
[SPEAKER_13]: I actually kind of am having a lot of fun with it, and that's what really games are all about.

310
00:21:15,550 --> 00:21:19,671
[SPEAKER_13]: So if you want the nostalgia of Final Fantasy IV all over again, definitely go check this out.

311
00:21:20,332 --> 00:21:22,993
[SPEAKER_13]: But you know what this made me think about as I was playing it?

312
00:21:24,321 --> 00:21:31,505
[SPEAKER_13]: Here's the thing, what really made me think about this was this whole story that we've been covering on the show the last couple weeks.

313
00:21:31,565 --> 00:21:34,446
[SPEAKER_13]: You know how Square shut down that Chrono Trigger fan project?

314
00:21:34,786 --> 00:21:43,010
[SPEAKER_13]: Remember how somebody was making this Chrono Trigger ROM for the Super Nintendo that was like, it was like using the old Chrono Trigger data but it was like a new story and all this stuff, remember this?

315
00:21:43,310 --> 00:21:47,632
[SPEAKER_13]: And Square sent them a cease and desist letter and we were like, you bastards, why did you shut down this project?

316
00:21:47,652 --> 00:21:48,593
[SPEAKER_13]: It was just a fan thing.

317
00:21:49,173 --> 00:21:54,061
[SPEAKER_13]: I realized this week they shut it down because that's what they did with Final Fantasy IV The After Years.

318
00:21:54,341 --> 00:21:55,143
[SPEAKER_13]: That's what it is.

319
00:21:55,563 --> 00:21:59,409
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a reskinned Final Fantasy IV with new dialogue, new stuff.

320
00:22:01,212 --> 00:22:02,894
[SPEAKER_13]: It didn't hit me until now.

321
00:22:02,934 --> 00:22:04,655
[SPEAKER_05]: Square is doing... They're like, don't do it before us.

322
00:22:05,095 --> 00:22:05,295
[SPEAKER_13]: Huh?

323
00:22:05,436 --> 00:22:06,256
[SPEAKER_05]: They're like, don't do it before us.

324
00:22:06,276 --> 00:22:07,417
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, in a way.

325
00:22:08,158 --> 00:22:13,842
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, even though this game's already been out in Japan on cell phones for a while, I think that's why they shut the Chrono Trigger project down.

326
00:22:14,183 --> 00:22:18,806
[SPEAKER_13]: If this Final Fantasy 4 thing is successful, I'll bet you they're going to do one for Chrono Trigger.

327
00:22:19,307 --> 00:22:20,488
[SPEAKER_13]: It's probably cheap to do.

328
00:22:22,085 --> 00:22:23,327
[SPEAKER_13]: So there's your answer, guys.

329
00:22:23,347 --> 00:22:24,628
[SPEAKER_13]: That's why it got shut down.

330
00:22:24,729 --> 00:22:25,510
[SPEAKER_14]: It is cheap to do.

331
00:22:25,570 --> 00:22:32,980
[SPEAKER_14]: All it is is programming scenarios and no real sprite creating since you're using the same sprites.

332
00:22:33,420 --> 00:22:35,984
[SPEAKER_14]: Just creating a few world maps with already sprites.

333
00:22:36,024 --> 00:22:37,005
[SPEAKER_13]: To be fair, and Henry,

334
00:22:37,005 --> 00:22:37,626
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you for watching!

335
00:23:03,729 --> 00:23:08,135
[SPEAKER_13]: Like Devil's Road, which is the road that connects Mysidia and Baron.

336
00:23:08,575 --> 00:23:12,280
[SPEAKER_13]: You used to just go in there and it would be and you'd appear in Baron.

337
00:23:12,540 --> 00:23:21,552
[SPEAKER_13]: Well now they've actually made, I don't think this is very spoilery and I apologize if you feel it is, but they've made a little dungeon to go with the connection now that you have to work your way through.

338
00:23:22,332 --> 00:23:26,674
[SPEAKER_13]: To say they have just only re-skinned it, that wouldn't be a fair thing to say.

339
00:23:27,055 --> 00:23:29,376
[SPEAKER_13]: They have done minor tweaks.

340
00:23:29,676 --> 00:23:34,438
[SPEAKER_13]: But I'm telling you, you're going to play this game and you're going to be like, I feel like I'm playing Final Fantasy 4+.

341
00:23:35,639 --> 00:23:43,663
[SPEAKER_13]: I feel like I've popped in my Final Fantasy 2 cartridge from the Super Nintendo and unlocked a whole secret level that wasn't there.

342
00:23:43,963 --> 00:23:44,943
[SPEAKER_13]: That's what it feels like.

343
00:23:45,624 --> 00:23:50,286
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's why this Chrono Trigger fan project got shut down because maybe this is the direction Square is heading in.

344
00:23:52,695 --> 00:24:18,148
[SPEAKER_13]: um let's see uh the Rob D in chat says the translator for Final Fantasy 6 apparently wasn't a Star Wars fan well all the Super Nintendo Final Fantasies yeah I remember it was it was something to do with Star Wars it was always Biggs and Wedge that's right okay so thank you Rob D that's right VIX was a mistranslation in the American Final Fantasy 2 and 3 they did VIX instead of Wedge but but or instead of Biggs so it makes sense I figured it was something like that as well but not in 7 mm-hmm remember

345
00:24:19,158 --> 00:24:22,962
[SPEAKER_04]: BlackWolf, our good buddy who celebrated his 200th episode right before we went live tonight, says in chat, It's really not.

346
00:24:23,622 --> 00:24:25,344
[SPEAKER_13]: 300 points for a couple hours worth of gameplay I think is worth it.

347
00:24:43,061 --> 00:24:44,983
[SPEAKER_13]: But, you know, I just understand.

348
00:24:45,003 --> 00:24:47,665
[SPEAKER_13]: You're going to be spending your money on something old school.

349
00:24:47,705 --> 00:24:53,550
[SPEAKER_13]: If you're spoiled by all these newfangled 3D graphics and things, I don't know if there's a lot here for you.

350
00:24:53,590 --> 00:24:58,034
[SPEAKER_13]: But if you love Final Fantasy 4 as much as I do, you're going to love this, I think.

351
00:24:58,134 --> 00:24:59,655
[SPEAKER_13]: I think it's definitely worth the price.

352
00:24:59,715 --> 00:25:03,298
[SPEAKER_13]: And quite honestly, I think all the add-ons will probably be worth it too.

353
00:25:03,618 --> 00:25:06,801
[SPEAKER_13]: Hell, I saw a great argument the other day on a forum or something.

354
00:25:07,041 --> 00:25:09,764
[SPEAKER_13]: Final Fantasy 2 as a cartridge when it came out was like $70.

355
00:25:09,804 --> 00:25:09,984
[SPEAKER_13]: Right?

356
00:25:11,365 --> 00:25:11,826
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you for watching!

357
00:25:23,226 --> 00:25:24,266
[SPEAKER_13]: So, there you go.

358
00:25:24,546 --> 00:25:28,728
[SPEAKER_13]: And HendersonManInChat apparently is a fan of the game and says, and that's what I wanted from the after years.

359
00:25:29,548 --> 00:25:32,709
[SPEAKER_13]: By the way, Rydia's story is $3 for about 4 hours.

360
00:25:33,129 --> 00:25:36,790
[SPEAKER_13]: So yeah, I mean, don't get me wrong, I'm not slamming the game for what they're doing.

361
00:25:36,950 --> 00:25:38,430
[SPEAKER_13]: It's just, you know, know what you're getting into.

362
00:25:38,510 --> 00:25:39,730
[SPEAKER_13]: I was caught a little off guard.

363
00:25:40,071 --> 00:25:46,732
[SPEAKER_13]: I was expecting it to be kind of like newer and fancier, but now that I'm kind of playing it, I'm like, you know, there's a part of me that's kind of glad it's not.

364
00:25:47,793 --> 00:25:50,373
[SPEAKER_13]: It is kind of neat to revisit that game I loved.

365
00:25:50,593 --> 00:25:52,034
[SPEAKER_13]: Literally loved.

366
00:25:53,013 --> 00:25:55,275
[SPEAKER_13]: 15 years ago, 18 years ago.

367
00:25:56,576 --> 00:26:02,560
[SPEAKER_13]: I do endorse Final Fantasy IV The After Years if you are a fan of Final Fantasy IV at all.

368
00:26:05,945 --> 00:26:08,147
[SPEAKER_13]: Rob D in chat says, yes, but times are different now.

369
00:26:08,187 --> 00:26:10,328
[SPEAKER_13]: Why should we judge it by antiquated pricing?

370
00:26:10,368 --> 00:26:11,589
[SPEAKER_13]: Not to say it's not worth it.

371
00:26:11,629 --> 00:26:13,070
[SPEAKER_13]: I just don't think that's a good argument.

372
00:26:13,911 --> 00:26:14,351
[SPEAKER_13]: Fair enough.

373
00:26:14,411 --> 00:26:15,111
[SPEAKER_13]: I see your point.

374
00:26:15,272 --> 00:26:17,833
[SPEAKER_13]: But, you know, there's a lot of crap out there.

375
00:26:17,873 --> 00:26:21,896
[SPEAKER_13]: They are trying to charge this $5 and $10 and do some of this episodic money for.

376
00:26:22,917 --> 00:26:31,083
[SPEAKER_13]: I think, you know, again, if you know what you're getting into, if you want that Final Fantasy IV old school nostalgia, you know, not a lot of people complain about Mega Man 9.

377
00:26:32,664 --> 00:26:33,865
[SPEAKER_13]: I think it's going to be worth it.

378
00:26:34,813 --> 00:26:36,995
[SPEAKER_13]: I did import the Sailor Moon Super S fighting game for $110.

379
00:27:02,754 --> 00:27:03,955
[SPEAKER_05]: My early days of importing.

380
00:27:04,075 --> 00:27:06,777
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, import game is a whole other story.

381
00:27:06,857 --> 00:27:09,119
[SPEAKER_13]: So there you go.

382
00:27:09,660 --> 00:27:13,443
[SPEAKER_13]: So Henderson Mann kind of concludes, this is the last thing I want to say on the Final Fantasy IV After Years.

383
00:27:13,883 --> 00:27:14,884
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, think of it like this.

384
00:27:14,964 --> 00:27:22,010
[SPEAKER_13]: The total price for Final Fantasy IV The After Years is $37 for the full game, about the same price as a DS game remake.

385
00:27:22,190 --> 00:27:22,770
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's true.

386
00:27:22,970 --> 00:27:23,591
[SPEAKER_13]: And you know what?

387
00:27:23,691 --> 00:27:26,233
[SPEAKER_13]: And in the end, when you add up all these hours, it would be what, like 21?

388
00:27:27,474 --> 00:27:31,317
[SPEAKER_13]: Probably about 30 hours of gameplay, which is about what you get out of a DS cartridge anyway.

389
00:27:31,397 --> 00:27:31,898
[SPEAKER_13]: So, you know,

390
00:27:33,050 --> 00:27:35,932
[SPEAKER_13]: But just again, not going to be your cutting edge graphics.

391
00:27:36,572 --> 00:27:38,354
[SPEAKER_13]: Think Mega Man 9, but Final Fantasy.

392
00:27:38,714 --> 00:27:39,374
[SPEAKER_13]: That's all I'm saying.

393
00:27:39,975 --> 00:27:41,095
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd pay for it, seriously.

394
00:27:43,457 --> 00:27:46,839
[SPEAKER_13]: My nostalgia strings are extremely tickled by this game.

395
00:27:47,980 --> 00:27:48,420
[SPEAKER_13]: Extremely.

396
00:27:49,401 --> 00:27:51,002
[SPEAKER_13]: And I hear the story gets really good.

397
00:27:51,122 --> 00:27:52,463
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm really avoiding spoilers.

398
00:27:52,863 --> 00:27:57,026
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm probably only about an hour and a half, two hours into the main episode.

399
00:27:57,426 --> 00:27:58,707
[SPEAKER_13]: I know I have plenty more to go.

400
00:27:59,427 --> 00:28:02,049
[SPEAKER_13]: But I'm squeeing so far.

401
00:28:02,958 --> 00:28:04,622
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you squeeing in a girly manner?

402
00:28:05,464 --> 00:28:06,106
[SPEAKER_13]: A little bit of both.

403
00:28:08,908 --> 00:28:12,529
[SPEAKER_13]: Anyhow, let's move on and get into some housekeeping tonight.

404
00:28:12,849 --> 00:28:13,249
[SPEAKER_13]: Housekeeping.

405
00:28:13,569 --> 00:28:17,550
[SPEAKER_13]: We are slowly getting the podcast caught up after our storage drive corruption.

406
00:28:17,570 --> 00:28:18,510
[SPEAKER_13]: We're almost caught up now.

407
00:28:18,550 --> 00:28:23,051
[SPEAKER_13]: We just need last week and this week, and this should all be caught up by the time the next show airs.

408
00:28:23,111 --> 00:28:27,292
[SPEAKER_13]: So sorry again to our faithful who listen to us on the podcast feed.

409
00:28:27,352 --> 00:28:29,232
[SPEAKER_13]: Sorry we have not been more reliable recently.

410
00:28:29,652 --> 00:28:32,673
[SPEAKER_13]: I hope you will still stick with us and continue to tell friends about the show.

411
00:28:33,073 --> 00:28:35,673
[SPEAKER_13]: It is never our intent to make you feel abandoned.

412
00:28:36,054 --> 00:28:36,814
[SPEAKER_13]: So sorry about that.

413
00:28:38,374 --> 00:28:47,338
[SPEAKER_13]: Also, I don't really have a whole lot else, so follow us on Twitter at twitter.com slash OLR or our Facebook is Orange Lounge Radio.

414
00:28:47,678 --> 00:28:50,719
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm pretty much going to stop plugging MySpace because I'm pretty much over MySpace.

415
00:28:50,999 --> 00:28:53,020
[SPEAKER_13]: Does anyone use MySpace anymore?

416
00:28:53,581 --> 00:28:54,341
[SPEAKER_05]: I did last night.

417
00:28:55,461 --> 00:28:55,782
[SPEAKER_13]: To what?

418
00:28:55,822 --> 00:28:56,542
[SPEAKER_13]: Clear out spam?

419
00:28:56,662 --> 00:28:57,162
[SPEAKER_13]: That's what I did.

420
00:28:57,202 --> 00:29:03,785
[SPEAKER_05]: No, to look up a band called Stovacore, which is a band that's all heavy metal that dresses up like Klingons and singing Klingon.

421
00:29:04,625 --> 00:29:10,069
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, alright, we're on MySpace, and if you want to add us there, you can, but I'm going to be honest, we haven't been doing a whole lot with it.

422
00:29:10,109 --> 00:29:11,910
[SPEAKER_13]: But to be honest, we haven't done a lot with Facebook either.

423
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:14,052
[SPEAKER_13]: We need to tape, like, special shows and things.

424
00:29:14,412 --> 00:29:19,876
[SPEAKER_13]: I will say this, though, our YouTube channel, after, like, two or three years, will finally get some new content.

425
00:29:19,916 --> 00:29:22,477
[SPEAKER_13]: We did take video on the E3 show floor.

426
00:29:22,537 --> 00:29:28,882
[SPEAKER_13]: We got me singing Karaoke Revolution, the new DDR games, Split Second, so there will be some stuff going to the Orange Archery.

427
00:29:28,902 --> 00:29:31,704
[SPEAKER_14]: You have me looking incredibly bored playing the new DDR game.

428
00:29:32,386 --> 00:29:33,887
[SPEAKER_14]: Because it's incredibly boring

429
00:29:50,399 --> 00:29:58,883
[SPEAKER_13]: Let's talk about music games, because there's been some very good music games at E3, some very bad music games at E3, and some very non-existent music games at E3.

430
00:29:58,963 --> 00:29:59,844
[SPEAKER_13]: That's where I want to start.

431
00:30:00,064 --> 00:30:01,324
[SPEAKER_13]: Where the hell was DJ Hero?

432
00:30:01,644 --> 00:30:03,545
[SPEAKER_13]: Isn't this game supposed to be out in a couple months?

433
00:30:03,785 --> 00:30:05,306
[SPEAKER_13]: It was shown behind closed doors.

434
00:30:05,366 --> 00:30:06,066
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, how nice.

435
00:30:07,267 --> 00:30:08,448
[SPEAKER_13]: Did they let people play it?

436
00:30:08,708 --> 00:30:11,169
[SPEAKER_14]: No, they had it demoed on a live stage.

437
00:30:11,209 --> 00:30:15,631
[SPEAKER_14]: They had it demoed in front of a crowd, and that was pretty cool, but they didn't let people play it.

438
00:30:17,446 --> 00:30:18,306
[SPEAKER_13]: and I'm very disappointed.

439
00:30:37,270 --> 00:30:37,791
[SPEAKER_13]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

440
00:31:00,009 --> 00:31:01,871
[SPEAKER_13]: DJ Hero 5, Guitar Hero Van Halen

441
00:31:24,346 --> 00:31:26,307
[SPEAKER_13]: Guitar Hero Van Halen was at Sony's booth

442
00:31:42,972 --> 00:31:44,613
[SPEAKER_14]: But they had it on stage.

443
00:31:44,633 --> 00:31:45,874
[SPEAKER_14]: They were demoing it on stage.

444
00:31:46,474 --> 00:31:49,156
[SPEAKER_14]: And DJ Hero looks sweet.

445
00:31:49,356 --> 00:31:50,257
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, I mean, don't get me wrong.

446
00:31:50,317 --> 00:31:52,178
[SPEAKER_13]: DJ Hero looks great.

447
00:31:52,518 --> 00:31:53,899
[SPEAKER_13]: But it looks fun to play.

448
00:31:54,759 --> 00:31:56,040
[SPEAKER_13]: I want to play it.

449
00:31:56,060 --> 00:31:58,181
[SPEAKER_13]: I want to get my hands on it and see for myself.

450
00:31:58,482 --> 00:31:58,942
[SPEAKER_13]: I understand.

451
00:31:59,062 --> 00:32:00,103
[SPEAKER_13]: Maybe that's what they're trying to do.

452
00:32:00,783 --> 00:32:03,224
[SPEAKER_13]: Maybe that's what they're trying to do, is leave it a mystery for all of us.

453
00:32:04,765 --> 00:32:10,748
[SPEAKER_13]: I still get frustrated at E3 when I see these millions of dollars spent to do this big DJ hero show.

454
00:32:10,868 --> 00:32:11,348
[SPEAKER_13]: For what?

455
00:32:11,368 --> 00:32:13,730
[SPEAKER_13]: For something behind closed doors for special people.

456
00:32:13,830 --> 00:32:15,430
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't think people are quite 100% behind it yet.

457
00:32:16,051 --> 00:32:18,472
[SPEAKER_14]: Before, they were only showing half the controller.

458
00:32:19,152 --> 00:32:19,732
[SPEAKER_14]: What the hell?

459
00:32:20,493 --> 00:32:25,175
[SPEAKER_14]: Before, they were probably expecting people to go, Oh my goodness, what is this?

460
00:32:25,195 --> 00:32:25,956
[SPEAKER_14]: This looks so cool.

461
00:32:25,976 --> 00:32:27,356
[SPEAKER_14]: I want to learn more about it.

462
00:32:27,416 --> 00:32:28,517
[SPEAKER_14]: But people were just kind of going...

463
00:32:29,448 --> 00:32:30,469
[SPEAKER_14]: How the hell are you going to play this?

464
00:32:31,050 --> 00:32:31,730
[SPEAKER_14]: This looks dumb.

465
00:32:31,870 --> 00:32:32,531
[SPEAKER_14]: What are they doing?

466
00:32:32,891 --> 00:32:40,038
[SPEAKER_14]: And then they finally, just during E3, they finally released the rest of the pictures of what the actual controller was.

467
00:32:41,199 --> 00:32:51,249
[SPEAKER_14]: Besides the fact that it was in Game Informer, but actually having it free to look at outside of Game Informer, they just put out the stuff for it.

468
00:32:51,950 --> 00:32:52,030
[SPEAKER_14]: Um...

469
00:32:53,226 --> 00:33:04,451
[SPEAKER_14]: But yeah, I mean, it looks cool, and I like watching it being performed, and they did both just, you know, an actual song, and then they did the one that they had the Beastie Boys mashup thing where the guy was playing the guitar.

470
00:33:04,951 --> 00:33:09,113
[SPEAKER_14]: Both of them look pretty cool, but I don't know.

471
00:33:09,213 --> 00:33:12,494
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, besides, you know, being able to play it, I mean, it looks cool.

472
00:33:14,383 --> 00:33:16,324
[SPEAKER_13]: Did you hear what they're doing with DDR?

473
00:33:34,139 --> 00:33:34,579
[SPEAKER_14]: No, what?

474
00:33:34,899 --> 00:33:36,060
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, you're going to love this.

475
00:33:36,100 --> 00:33:37,401
[SPEAKER_13]: You're going to love this.

476
00:33:37,421 --> 00:33:38,221
[SPEAKER_13]: Can I mini rant?

477
00:33:38,341 --> 00:33:38,701
[SPEAKER_13]: Go ahead.

478
00:33:38,741 --> 00:33:42,043
[SPEAKER_13]: Why don't I do my mini rant, and then you can piss me off even more with what you're about to say.

479
00:33:42,063 --> 00:33:42,263
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

480
00:33:42,283 --> 00:33:42,843
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay?

481
00:33:43,824 --> 00:33:48,766
[SPEAKER_13]: Keep in mind, folks, this show would not exist if it weren't for DDR.

482
00:33:49,487 --> 00:33:54,429
[SPEAKER_13]: I love what DDR has done for my life and the people it's introduced me to and all of this stuff.

483
00:33:54,809 --> 00:33:56,550
[SPEAKER_13]: That being said... Uh-oh.

484
00:33:56,810 --> 00:33:57,490
[SPEAKER_13]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

485
00:34:18,775 --> 00:34:24,879
[SPEAKER_13]: People were kind of heckling and saying, this is just going to turn into a sports game.

486
00:34:24,979 --> 00:34:26,721
[SPEAKER_13]: It's the roster update 2009.

487
00:34:27,421 --> 00:34:28,442
[SPEAKER_13]: It's just new songs.

488
00:34:29,102 --> 00:34:30,123
[SPEAKER_13]: I apologize.

489
00:34:30,263 --> 00:34:31,004
[SPEAKER_13]: You were right.

490
00:34:31,944 --> 00:34:32,445
[SPEAKER_13]: You were right.

491
00:34:32,665 --> 00:34:34,186
[SPEAKER_13]: That's what the franchise has turned into.

492
00:34:34,807 --> 00:34:37,108
[SPEAKER_13]: It's roster update 2009 with new songs.

493
00:34:37,569 --> 00:34:39,350
[SPEAKER_13]: I see nothing here to report on.

494
00:34:40,729 --> 00:34:41,450
[SPEAKER_13]: Rihanna's in it.

495
00:34:41,610 --> 00:34:42,151
[SPEAKER_12]: Whoopee!

496
00:34:44,233 --> 00:34:47,556
[SPEAKER_13]: On the Wii One, you can now play on the balance board and shake your hips.

497
00:34:48,016 --> 00:34:49,117
[SPEAKER_13]: Yay!

498
00:34:49,478 --> 00:34:50,158
[SPEAKER_05]: That is new.

499
00:34:50,519 --> 00:34:51,580
[SPEAKER_05]: That is something legitimately new.

500
00:34:51,640 --> 00:34:52,901
[SPEAKER_13]: It is new and it is stupid.

501
00:34:53,582 --> 00:34:56,825
[SPEAKER_05]: I agree with the stupid part, but hey, it is new.

502
00:34:57,085 --> 00:35:09,794
[SPEAKER_14]: Then, not only that, not, okay, so, it would piss off fans enough that they didn't really do anything with the song list, that the song list sucks, and that, you know, the songs that they've just brought back a bunch of older songs and stuff like that.

503
00:35:10,674 --> 00:35:12,095
[SPEAKER_14]: That would be fine as it is.

504
00:35:12,535 --> 00:35:14,517
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, but they didn't leave it there.

505
00:35:15,017 --> 00:35:20,341
[SPEAKER_14]: No, let's piss people off by taking Dynamite Rave and changing the lyrics to it, making it even worse.

506
00:35:20,361 --> 00:35:21,481
[SPEAKER_13]: I hate to tell you, they already did that.

507
00:35:21,521 --> 00:35:26,745
[SPEAKER_13]: Download the DDR for the iPhone, you can download Brilliant to you with lyrics, and it'll make your inner Bomani fanboy cry.

508
00:35:28,146 --> 00:35:29,467
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, it's still sad.

509
00:35:30,247 --> 00:35:31,168
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm just, I'm just, I've done.

510
00:35:31,188 --> 00:35:32,729
[SPEAKER_13]: That's how long it's been since I pleaded.

511
00:35:32,869 --> 00:35:33,709
[SPEAKER_13]: I've given up on Konami.

512
00:35:33,869 --> 00:35:35,290
[SPEAKER_13]: I've given up on these games.

513
00:35:35,671 --> 00:35:36,411
[SPEAKER_13]: I officially give up.

514
00:35:36,571 --> 00:35:39,593
[SPEAKER_13]: But Rob, how can they possibly innovate this game?

515
00:35:39,713 --> 00:35:41,935
[SPEAKER_13]: Can I, can I read, can I read this comment from chat real fast?

516
00:35:42,475 --> 00:35:48,979
[SPEAKER_13]: Comment from chat, Actdeft, 8 arrows for the 360 and PS3, Alpha Cananogram, did you try PS3 360 version with 8 arrow pad?

517
00:35:49,459 --> 00:35:50,320
[SPEAKER_13]: No, it was not on the floor.

518
00:35:50,540 --> 00:35:50,700
[SPEAKER_14]: Nope.

519
00:35:51,501 --> 00:35:54,903
[SPEAKER_14]: And they did have that, and Technomotion did it first.

520
00:35:56,548 --> 00:35:57,148
[SPEAKER_13]: You know what, though?

521
00:35:57,628 --> 00:35:58,109
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't care.

522
00:35:58,189 --> 00:35:59,289
[SPEAKER_13]: Technomotion was shit.

523
00:35:59,509 --> 00:36:03,631
[SPEAKER_13]: If you ever actually played Technomotion, it was fucking garbage, okay?

524
00:36:03,951 --> 00:36:08,652
[SPEAKER_13]: It's the one game everybody talked about back in the day, like, hey, I played Technomotion, because nobody had it.

525
00:36:08,752 --> 00:36:09,032
[SPEAKER_13]: Why?

526
00:36:09,113 --> 00:36:10,313
[SPEAKER_13]: Because it was fucking garbage.

527
00:36:10,833 --> 00:36:16,335
[SPEAKER_13]: So, okay, fine, if this is how DDR is going to innovate with the 8-arrow pad, whatever, let's see the goods.

528
00:36:16,455 --> 00:36:17,635
[SPEAKER_13]: Maybe I'll change my mind.

529
00:36:17,816 --> 00:36:20,517
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm not convinced adding four more arrows is going to make it any more fun.

530
00:36:20,537 --> 00:36:21,737
[SPEAKER_13]: It's not going to make it any more fun.

531
00:36:22,901 --> 00:36:23,843
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, is that what you were going to tell me?

532
00:36:23,863 --> 00:36:24,785
[SPEAKER_13]: It's going to piss me off even more?

533
00:36:24,845 --> 00:36:25,066
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

534
00:36:25,848 --> 00:36:28,995
[SPEAKER_14]: Because it's not going to make it more fun because they don't understand.

535
00:36:29,055 --> 00:36:30,097
[SPEAKER_14]: They don't understand what...

536
00:36:30,748 --> 00:36:31,989
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

537
00:36:54,867 --> 00:36:56,148
[SPEAKER_14]: But people aren't doing that anymore.

538
00:36:56,268 --> 00:37:00,129
[SPEAKER_14]: And so now you're going after these new people instead of trying to recapture fans.

539
00:37:00,149 --> 00:37:01,970
[SPEAKER_14]: You already had your base right there.

540
00:37:02,190 --> 00:37:04,651
[SPEAKER_14]: If you kept them happy, you would be selling enough each year.

541
00:37:05,451 --> 00:37:05,952
[SPEAKER_13]: Newsflash.

542
00:37:06,112 --> 00:37:09,553
[SPEAKER_13]: Konami does not care about the DDR fan base because we all got old.

543
00:37:09,933 --> 00:37:12,474
[SPEAKER_13]: It's been 10 years and we're all too old to dance now.

544
00:37:12,814 --> 00:37:14,535
[SPEAKER_13]: So they are going after children.

545
00:37:14,835 --> 00:37:16,076
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, that's what it is.

546
00:37:17,056 --> 00:37:18,217
[SPEAKER_13]: I hate to break it to you folks.

547
00:37:18,657 --> 00:37:20,037
[SPEAKER_13]: Konami does not care.

548
00:37:20,077 --> 00:37:20,918
[SPEAKER_13]: You're all 30 now.

549
00:37:21,198 --> 00:37:23,199
[SPEAKER_13]: Konami does not care about you anymore.

550
00:37:24,139 --> 00:37:45,002
[SPEAKER_05]: you're all gonna have kids and they want your kids playing DDR that's that's where it's at they need to remember is that we for all of us who grew up gamers we're not gonna buy shit for our kids we're not gonna buy them crappy games we're gonna buy them stuff that we'll want to play too but the thing I mean I was even thinking about this on the ride over here today like

551
00:37:45,883 --> 00:37:49,644
[SPEAKER_14]: The problem with Konami is they don't get what makes their games sell.

552
00:37:50,125 --> 00:37:55,847
[SPEAKER_14]: It's basically, you know, with DDR, it was all about the music and kind of the surprises.

553
00:37:55,947 --> 00:38:01,289
[SPEAKER_14]: Like with each different mix, they were adding something that was kind of new that was surprising.

554
00:38:01,349 --> 00:38:03,530
[SPEAKER_14]: Like the freeze arrows and stuff, that was kind of surprising for us.

555
00:38:03,550 --> 00:38:04,690
[SPEAKER_14]: There was a new element in there.

556
00:38:04,810 --> 00:38:05,351
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

557
00:38:26,144 --> 00:38:31,529
[SPEAKER_14]: They don't really want to do any of that, so what they're going to do is... I'm with you.

558
00:38:31,609 --> 00:38:35,593
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't even know what the hell they're calling this game, because it just said Dance Dance Revolution.

559
00:38:35,613 --> 00:38:35,913
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't care.

560
00:38:35,953 --> 00:38:38,896
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, I don't care either, but... I don't want to tell you what it's called.

561
00:38:39,837 --> 00:38:40,357
[SPEAKER_13]: Honestly.

562
00:38:41,038 --> 00:38:43,340
[SPEAKER_13]: As a journalist, or whatever... Yeah, right.

563
00:38:43,740 --> 00:38:44,281
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, whatever.

564
00:38:44,381 --> 00:38:46,723
[SPEAKER_13]: As a blogger, pod... Whatever the fuck I am.

565
00:38:47,464 --> 00:38:50,607
[SPEAKER_13]: As me, I don't want to tell you what it's called, because I don't care.

566
00:38:52,114 --> 00:38:54,115
[SPEAKER_13]: That's the point I've gotten to with these games.

567
00:38:54,595 --> 00:38:56,136
[SPEAKER_13]: I know people work very hard on them.

568
00:38:56,756 --> 00:38:59,517
[SPEAKER_13]: No, they don't work very hard on them.

569
00:38:59,557 --> 00:39:00,437
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm sorry.

570
00:39:00,878 --> 00:39:02,478
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't see it.

571
00:39:02,638 --> 00:39:02,978
[SPEAKER_13]: Here's the thing.

572
00:39:03,919 --> 00:39:06,180
[SPEAKER_13]: I think this chatter is absolutely right.

573
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:10,321
[SPEAKER_13]: Sephiroth1215 says, no, they don't care anymore because Jason Enos is gone.

574
00:39:10,361 --> 00:39:11,522
[SPEAKER_13]: That's when DDR went downhill.

575
00:39:11,542 --> 00:39:11,842
[SPEAKER_13]: That's true.

576
00:39:12,182 --> 00:39:13,603
[SPEAKER_05]: That is exactly it.

577
00:39:13,723 --> 00:39:15,243
[SPEAKER_13]: I ran into him a few months ago, actually.

578
00:39:15,283 --> 00:39:16,044
[SPEAKER_13]: He works at EA now.

579
00:39:16,484 --> 00:39:17,604
[SPEAKER_13]: He doesn't work at EA anymore.

580
00:39:17,644 --> 00:39:19,245
[SPEAKER_05]: He also saw the games live.

581
00:39:19,685 --> 00:39:25,390
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know if I can say what game he's been working on, but it's more casual games, I guess, is what he's doing now.

582
00:39:25,410 --> 00:39:26,511
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe we'll get him on the show at some point.

583
00:39:26,551 --> 00:39:29,173
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll shoot an email or something.

584
00:39:40,723 --> 00:39:43,885
[SPEAKER_13]: But, yeah, you know, obviously that was huge.

585
00:39:44,085 --> 00:39:48,728
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, not just that, but the whole San Francisco office shut down, and that's where a lot of the fans were working during the steps.

586
00:39:48,788 --> 00:39:49,829
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, that was huge.

587
00:39:50,129 --> 00:39:54,092
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't buy that, oh, well, you know, there's people working hard in this game.

588
00:39:55,583 --> 00:39:58,606
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, that's pretty sad then if this is the best you can do.

589
00:39:58,846 --> 00:40:07,335
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, because really, all they did was just recycle the whole engine again, maybe change some assets to it, and just said, okay, what songs are we going to throw in there now?

590
00:40:07,695 --> 00:40:09,257
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, here's the licensed songs we want.

591
00:40:09,317 --> 00:40:11,819
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, let's see what else we can fill up the song list with.

592
00:40:11,859 --> 00:40:13,461
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, so, look, moving on.

593
00:40:13,621 --> 00:40:15,443
[SPEAKER_05]: What's our game to advertise their music?

594
00:40:15,543 --> 00:40:17,725
[SPEAKER_13]: Dance Dance Revolution, awesome if you're seven.

595
00:40:21,388 --> 00:40:28,974
[SPEAKER_13]: By the way, if you need further proof that Konami does not care about the fans from ten years ago, look at what they did to poppin' music on the Wii, right?

596
00:40:29,354 --> 00:40:35,278
[SPEAKER_13]: They're relaunching poppin' music with this whole new control scheme and I guess song lists and stuff.

597
00:40:35,298 --> 00:40:37,720
[SPEAKER_14]: They say 150 classic tracks will be downloadable.

598
00:40:38,743 --> 00:40:39,204
[SPEAKER_14]: at launch.

599
00:40:39,824 --> 00:40:40,946
[SPEAKER_13]: Is this the new PS3 one?

600
00:40:41,046 --> 00:40:41,246
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

601
00:40:42,267 --> 00:40:44,409
[SPEAKER_13]: To be fair, I might check it out.

602
00:40:45,290 --> 00:40:52,498
[SPEAKER_13]: The nostalgia fanboy in me kind of is curious but it's a thin line with me right now that they're walking.

603
00:40:53,479 --> 00:40:53,940
[SPEAKER_13]: Thin line.

604
00:40:54,140 --> 00:40:55,562
[SPEAKER_05]: You want to see the nature of the train wreck?

605
00:40:56,202 --> 00:40:56,463
[SPEAKER_13]: Anyhow.

606
00:40:58,019 --> 00:41:00,401
[SPEAKER_13]: because I love DDR at its core.

607
00:41:00,461 --> 00:41:03,483
[SPEAKER_13]: That's why I get so impassioned about looking at where it's at now.

608
00:41:03,503 --> 00:41:08,847
[SPEAKER_14]: It's really frustrating when it really isn't that hard to turn this thing around, but they just don't want to do it.

609
00:41:09,727 --> 00:41:12,709
[SPEAKER_13]: Anyhow, Karaoke Revolution was also at Konami's booth.

610
00:41:13,409 --> 00:41:19,793
[SPEAKER_13]: I was surprised at how current the song list was, because they had, like, My Life Will Suck Without You, Just Dance by Lady Gaga.

611
00:41:19,813 --> 00:41:32,061
[SPEAKER_13]: They did have some current tracks, but honestly, to me, it felt like the same game we had on the PlayStation 2 without the American Idol stuff now, just with, you know, 720p, slightly souped-up engine.

612
00:41:32,241 --> 00:41:34,202
[SPEAKER_13]: I didn't see a lot of new stuff in there.

613
00:41:34,583 --> 00:41:37,685
[SPEAKER_13]: I imagine they're going to have the download store like every other music game now, but

614
00:41:38,485 --> 00:41:39,085
[SPEAKER_13]: www.DarkSakura.com

615
00:42:00,552 --> 00:42:27,758
[SPEAKER_13]: but I have a feeling Karaoke Revolution is going to be more of a robust jukebox by the time it's done which is kind of sad because Sony owns their own record label but when you look at what's available on SingStar it's very narrow especially when you consider that most of it is UK based music which isn't a bad thing they have some great music over there but not a lot of tunes that are going to be a big hit at parties here in the US because nobody's going to know them so that is a fair point

616
00:42:28,604 --> 00:42:39,151
[SPEAKER_13]: Anyhow, I think that's where Karaoke Revolution may win some people over because I think there's a lot of people who haven't taken the plunge into SingStar or Lips that might still be able to get brought on board with Karaoke Revolution.

617
00:42:39,331 --> 00:42:39,672
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know.

618
00:42:40,272 --> 00:42:42,013
[SPEAKER_13]: I do have nice things to say about Konami.

619
00:42:42,594 --> 00:42:44,575
[SPEAKER_13]: One of my favorite games of the show was at their booth.

620
00:42:45,055 --> 00:42:51,520
[SPEAKER_13]: But before we get to that, I want to talk about one of my favorite games of the show, period, which was a music game, Beatles Rock Band.

621
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:52,160
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

622
00:42:52,520 --> 00:42:53,021
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, my God.

623
00:42:53,161 --> 00:42:54,281
[SPEAKER_05]: I saw the trailer for that.

624
00:42:55,302 --> 00:42:58,084
[SPEAKER_13]: Everybody's talking about that introduction and how amazing it is.

625
00:42:58,524 --> 00:43:02,567
[SPEAKER_13]: And let me tell you, the game itself looks just awesome.

626
00:43:02,647 --> 00:43:05,289
[SPEAKER_13]: Loki, I don't know, you want to talk about our experience at Beatles Rock Band?

627
00:43:05,509 --> 00:43:16,156
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, I mean, the thing everybody's harping on, harmonics and both Activision and that kind of stuff, and EA, is that they're taking these...

628
00:43:17,777 --> 00:43:18,958
[SPEAKER_14]: Thanks for watching!

629
00:43:47,333 --> 00:43:50,576
[SPEAKER_14]: But with Beatles Rock Band, they've redone the whole style of the game.

630
00:43:50,716 --> 00:43:55,420
[SPEAKER_14]: It's kind of this very stylized version of stuff.

631
00:43:55,860 --> 00:44:06,489
[SPEAKER_14]: I like the new things that they're doing now with the dreamscapes, which they kind of touched on a little bit in the trailers and the intro where you see some really trippy stuff that goes along with the songs.

632
00:44:06,909 --> 00:44:08,511
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, that's really cool and different.

633
00:44:09,211 --> 00:44:14,956
[SPEAKER_14]: And the three-point harmonies are pretty cool in there and how you don't really have to...

634
00:44:15,636 --> 00:44:20,360
[SPEAKER_13]: Those stages for Here Comes the Sun and Octopus Gardens, those dream skates, that was amazing.

635
00:44:20,700 --> 00:44:21,241
[SPEAKER_13]: Amazing.

636
00:44:22,081 --> 00:44:23,262
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

637
00:44:23,282 --> 00:44:27,225
[SPEAKER_14]: The three-part harmonies are pretty cool, how you can pick which one you want to do.

638
00:44:29,487 --> 00:44:36,172
[SPEAKER_14]: Just like the little stuff that they've added, little tweaks to make the game flow better and play better and is more fun.

639
00:44:37,653 --> 00:44:40,715
[SPEAKER_14]: That kind of stuff, focusing on the gameplay was really cool.

640
00:44:41,576 --> 00:44:43,297
[SPEAKER_14]: They're even going to support it with download content.

641
00:44:43,397 --> 00:44:43,778
[SPEAKER_14]: Obviously,

642
00:44:44,258 --> 00:44:44,838
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura, Luke, Carameldansen

643
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:20,062
[SPEAKER_13]: But they are working on different things Thank you Harmonix though for not putting out a Rock Band 3 this year Can I just say that?

644
00:45:20,102 --> 00:45:43,428
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you for not showing Rock Band 3 However, at the same time you did show Rock Band Lego thing Which is kind of, I guess in a way that's cheating It's more for the pop stuff Like for the family type songs More pop kind of stuff And that was kind of neat looking But they are doing the same thing on the Activision side with Band Hero They just didn't really show much of it

645
00:45:44,693 --> 00:45:47,895
[SPEAKER_13]: Sephiroth 1215 says, Okay, so I say the Beatles can suck it.

646
00:45:47,955 --> 00:45:49,176
[SPEAKER_13]: Why should I buy this game?

647
00:45:49,376 --> 00:45:49,937
[SPEAKER_13]: Which is fair.

648
00:45:50,017 --> 00:45:52,538
[SPEAKER_13]: Not everybody respects the classic music stuff.

649
00:45:53,379 --> 00:45:54,300
[SPEAKER_13]: Music might not be for everybody.

650
00:45:54,900 --> 00:45:55,540
[SPEAKER_13]: But I'll tell you what.

651
00:45:56,801 --> 00:45:57,302
[SPEAKER_13]: Here's the thing.

652
00:45:57,322 --> 00:45:59,943
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know if I overheard this at the booth or somebody told me this.

653
00:45:59,963 --> 00:46:02,025
[SPEAKER_13]: And I apologize if it was you and I'm not giving you credit.

654
00:46:02,385 --> 00:46:04,106
[SPEAKER_13]: But somebody said, You know what?

655
00:46:04,586 --> 00:46:05,047
[SPEAKER_13]: No matter...

656
00:46:06,921 --> 00:46:11,185
[SPEAKER_13]: No matter what kind of music you listen to, you hear these songs in the Beatles games.

657
00:46:11,625 --> 00:46:14,788
[SPEAKER_13]: You can't help but hum along or recognize these songs.

658
00:46:15,148 --> 00:46:19,091
[SPEAKER_13]: How often do you play Rock Band or Rock Band 2 and you're like, I've never heard that song before.

659
00:46:19,111 --> 00:46:20,332
[SPEAKER_13]: I can't do that song.

660
00:46:20,552 --> 00:46:22,714
[SPEAKER_13]: But with the Beatles songs, there's an awful lot of them.

661
00:46:22,995 --> 00:46:26,177
[SPEAKER_13]: You just know because they are so embedded in our culture.

662
00:46:26,257 --> 00:46:28,739
[SPEAKER_13]: You know a lot of these songs.

663
00:46:28,859 --> 00:46:29,980
[SPEAKER_13]: I think that's a big part of it.

664
00:46:30,241 --> 00:46:31,281
[SPEAKER_13]: Plus, for me...

665
00:46:32,262 --> 00:46:35,964
[SPEAKER_13]: The Rock Band Beatles, that's the way to do an artist's game.

666
00:46:36,124 --> 00:46:43,848
[SPEAKER_13]: It makes the Guitar Hero, Aerosmith games, and Van Halen games, and Metallica games look like cheap reskins.

667
00:46:43,888 --> 00:46:50,271
[SPEAKER_14]: Can you imagine if they did a Pink Floyd or something really trippy and stuff with a Rock Band type thing?

668
00:46:50,591 --> 00:46:57,435
[SPEAKER_14]: The same different stylized stuff, or like a Gorillaz game or something like that, same stylized...

669
00:46:59,090 --> 00:47:02,592
[SPEAKER_14]: They should change it up with each artist that they do it and then it would be really cool.

670
00:47:04,753 --> 00:47:06,353
[SPEAKER_13]: I just think this is the way to do it.

671
00:47:06,393 --> 00:47:15,897
[SPEAKER_13]: And by the way, if you don't understand what I meant earlier about how DDR needs to innovate itself and change, this is a perfect example.

672
00:47:16,517 --> 00:47:17,078
[SPEAKER_13]: You know what I mean?

673
00:47:18,358 --> 00:47:26,962
[SPEAKER_13]: My expectations going into this because of all the other music games I've seen lately were very low going in to look at the Beatles rock band and just kind of seeing that they've really made it like a Beatles experience.

674
00:47:27,682 --> 00:47:30,844
[SPEAKER_13]: I was like, wow, they know how to do it.

675
00:47:31,384 --> 00:47:35,147
[SPEAKER_13]: And honestly, I think other companies could be really learning a lot from this, and hopefully they are.

676
00:47:35,727 --> 00:47:36,027
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know.

677
00:47:37,348 --> 00:47:43,512
[SPEAKER_13]: So I just, you know, it just, it felt, it's so hard for me to put into words.

678
00:47:43,612 --> 00:47:45,333
[SPEAKER_13]: It's something you have to see for yourself, I guess.

679
00:47:45,693 --> 00:47:50,356
[SPEAKER_13]: But it feels, it doesn't feel like a cheap reskinning or a cash-in type game.

680
00:47:50,416 --> 00:47:53,638
[SPEAKER_13]: It feels like a Beatles tribute.

681
00:47:55,018 --> 00:47:55,359
[SPEAKER_13]: It's great.

682
00:47:58,086 --> 00:48:00,827
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, so we watched some people play that, and it was cool.

683
00:48:02,388 --> 00:48:04,649
[SPEAKER_13]: Lego Rock Band, since that got brought up a minute ago.

684
00:48:04,989 --> 00:48:06,410
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm not as excited about that.

685
00:48:06,690 --> 00:48:09,111
[SPEAKER_13]: Now, that does look like a cheap reskinning of an old game.

686
00:48:09,751 --> 00:48:10,711
[SPEAKER_13]: I gotta be honest.

687
00:48:10,851 --> 00:48:23,816
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, it's gonna have the pop songs and all that stuff, which I suppose is gonna make or break the deal, and it's for the kids or what have you, but I literally was looking at Lego Rock Band going, this just looks like Rock Band 2 with Lego people.

688
00:48:23,916 --> 00:48:26,138
[SPEAKER_14]: I didn't really show off a lot of stuff that they were talking about though.

689
00:48:26,159 --> 00:48:35,109
[SPEAKER_14]: I remember with Lego Rock Band they said they were going to have kind of an adventure mode type stuff where you battle monsters and whatnot while playing music, that kind of stuff.

690
00:48:35,569 --> 00:48:37,371
[SPEAKER_14]: So that might be something kind of neat.

691
00:48:37,551 --> 00:48:38,913
[SPEAKER_14]: And the soundtrack really kind of...

692
00:48:40,808 --> 00:48:42,530
[SPEAKER_14]: would make or break this game, I think.

693
00:48:43,130 --> 00:48:45,812
[SPEAKER_14]: But right now, it's hard to say.

694
00:48:45,932 --> 00:48:46,533
[SPEAKER_14]: It just looks neat.

695
00:48:47,274 --> 00:48:50,196
[SPEAKER_14]: Because you can rock out into a Lego pirate ship and that kind of stuff.

696
00:48:50,917 --> 00:48:52,058
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, that's just kind of neat.

697
00:48:52,378 --> 00:48:53,158
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd do that anyway.

698
00:48:53,519 --> 00:48:56,401
[SPEAKER_14]: In the end, really, you don't have to buy this game.

699
00:48:56,481 --> 00:48:58,123
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, it's just optional.

700
00:48:58,223 --> 00:49:03,747
[SPEAKER_14]: If it's something that you think would be cool, cool, pick it up.

701
00:49:05,269 --> 00:49:07,791
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't think it's being sold in the bundles, so...

702
00:49:09,226 --> 00:49:09,666
[SPEAKER_13]: BlackWolf

703
00:49:38,112 --> 00:49:40,033
[SPEAKER_13]: in chat also kind of sent me this.

704
00:49:40,093 --> 00:49:43,975
[SPEAKER_13]: It's kind of like a food for thought, and I actually think it's a really interesting theory.

705
00:49:44,595 --> 00:49:45,255
[SPEAKER_13]: I want to read this.

706
00:49:45,716 --> 00:49:47,796
[SPEAKER_13]: The conspiracy behind Lego Rock Band.

707
00:49:48,117 --> 00:49:54,019
[SPEAKER_13]: Think about which music company's CEO felt that they aren't getting enough money from licensing for music games.

708
00:49:54,640 --> 00:49:57,221
[SPEAKER_13]: Now think about which company is publishing Lego Rock Band.

709
00:49:57,861 --> 00:50:02,363
[SPEAKER_13]: Now realize that download content for Lego Rock Band is not compatible with Rock Band 2.

710
00:50:03,144 --> 00:50:03,964
[SPEAKER_13]: Connect the dots.

711
00:50:07,398 --> 00:50:12,680
[SPEAKER_13]: That's an amazing thought, actually, and something I think a lot of people are overlooking.

712
00:50:13,101 --> 00:50:14,381
[SPEAKER_13]: It probably has a lot to do with it.

713
00:50:14,721 --> 00:50:15,222
[SPEAKER_13]: Absolutely.

714
00:50:15,802 --> 00:50:16,242
[SPEAKER_06]: Probably.

715
00:50:16,282 --> 00:50:17,703
[SPEAKER_13]: Isn't Warner putting out this?

716
00:50:17,723 --> 00:50:18,303
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, it is.

717
00:50:18,963 --> 00:50:20,664
[SPEAKER_13]: Which record label was having a big stink?

718
00:50:21,244 --> 00:50:21,544
[SPEAKER_13]: Warner.

719
00:50:23,005 --> 00:50:24,405
[SPEAKER_13]: I think you've stumbled onto something, Bobby.

720
00:50:24,465 --> 00:50:24,805
[SPEAKER_13]: Good job.

721
00:50:24,845 --> 00:50:25,306
[SPEAKER_13]: Gold star.

722
00:50:25,826 --> 00:50:26,626
[SPEAKER_05]: You get a Scooby snack.

723
00:50:27,246 --> 00:50:29,867
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

724
00:50:30,348 --> 00:50:33,349
[SPEAKER_13]: We share the radio night with you here on All Games for a reason, Bobby.

725
00:50:33,740 --> 00:50:34,500
[SPEAKER_14]: Thanks for watching!

726
00:50:56,429 --> 00:51:03,590
[SPEAKER_13]: and those folks that were thinking that, oh, Kensha Hall is lost and gone and what have you, you could still feel their presence there a little bit.

727
00:51:04,290 --> 00:51:16,933
[SPEAKER_13]: In the space that would have been taken up by Blizzard and some of these other companies that didn't come to E3 this year, they did have some of the old Kensha Hall, like DDR Game, you know, going back to the, you know, they're always there at E3 showing off their hard pads and stuff.

728
00:51:17,153 --> 00:51:18,353
[SPEAKER_13]: They were there doing their thing.

729
00:51:18,733 --> 00:51:24,294
[SPEAKER_13]: So, you know, they still have some of the old Kensha Hall companies are making a showing and the Indiecade, which was, you know, kind of cool.

730
00:51:25,979 --> 00:51:27,505
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright, what do we want to do?

731
00:51:27,586 --> 00:51:28,410
[SPEAKER_13]: Let's talk about...

732
00:51:30,307 --> 00:51:32,468
[SPEAKER_13]: Let's talk about some of the press conferences.

733
00:51:32,589 --> 00:51:32,949
[SPEAKER_13]: Why not?

734
00:51:33,029 --> 00:51:37,052
[SPEAKER_13]: I know you guys probably have heard all that you wanted to hear on the press conferences.

735
00:51:37,152 --> 00:51:41,715
[SPEAKER_13]: I just want to recap, give you guys a chance to give your input on the press conferences, what you thought.

736
00:51:41,855 --> 00:51:43,956
[SPEAKER_05]: I was following Twitter during a lot of this, too.

737
00:51:44,096 --> 00:51:44,476
[SPEAKER_13]: Were you?

738
00:51:44,697 --> 00:51:52,282
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I was at work, and of course I can't get on to watch any of the stuff, but I was getting feedback through Twitter, and there's some very interesting things.

739
00:51:52,342 --> 00:51:52,902
[SPEAKER_13]: I stayed home.

740
00:51:53,523 --> 00:51:55,904
[SPEAKER_13]: You know what pissed me off on the Twitter thing?

741
00:51:56,304 --> 00:51:59,847
[SPEAKER_13]: People that declared Microsoft won before Sony was done.

742
00:52:00,487 --> 00:52:00,968
[SPEAKER_13]: Shut up!

743
00:52:01,948 --> 00:52:04,470
[SPEAKER_13]: You know that all the good stuff- I mean, fanboy!

744
00:52:04,851 --> 00:52:06,232
[SPEAKER_13]: Hello, fanboy!

745
00:52:06,952 --> 00:52:08,293
[SPEAKER_13]: Sony was not even done yet.

746
00:52:08,353 --> 00:52:10,615
[SPEAKER_13]: Of course they left their feathers in the cap until the end.

747
00:52:10,875 --> 00:52:13,837
[SPEAKER_13]: Call me a Sony fanboy if you want, but go back to the archives of this show.

748
00:52:13,857 --> 00:52:15,219
[SPEAKER_13]: We've been highly critical of it in the past.

749
00:52:15,259 --> 00:52:15,879
[SPEAKER_14]: I left it open-ended.

750
00:52:15,919 --> 00:52:22,604
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm like, you know, Microsoft has won this unless Sony really brings something to the table that's, you know, outstanding.

751
00:52:22,624 --> 00:52:24,586
[SPEAKER_14]: Because if they brought what they brought last year-

752
00:52:25,683 --> 00:52:28,045
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

753
00:52:42,893 --> 00:53:11,905
[SPEAKER_13]: or everybody was a winner it really depended on what you were looking for this year in the games and honestly I think Microsoft had a lot of great ideas I think Sony had a lot of great implementations and I think Nintendo well they'll always have soccer moms Nintendo had a lot of last year oh and then this that's pretty much what we had from Nintendo

754
00:53:12,811 --> 00:53:14,111
[SPEAKER_13]: The chat room is speaking up.

755
00:53:14,431 --> 00:53:16,932
[SPEAKER_13]: Bobby, Actdeft, and some other folks saying the winners are gamers.

756
00:53:17,072 --> 00:53:18,432
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's true.

757
00:53:18,612 --> 00:53:21,773
[SPEAKER_13]: And I was commenting to Loki this as I was walking around the show floor.

758
00:53:22,173 --> 00:53:22,994
[SPEAKER_13]: I was like, you know what?

759
00:53:23,134 --> 00:53:25,254
[SPEAKER_13]: I haven't really played a shitty game yet this year.

760
00:53:25,694 --> 00:53:27,815
[SPEAKER_13]: Usually at E3, there's a real stinker of a game.

761
00:53:27,835 --> 00:53:29,775
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm kind of like, oh, I don't know about this game.

762
00:53:29,815 --> 00:53:30,715
[SPEAKER_04]: I take that back.

763
00:53:30,855 --> 00:53:31,376
[SPEAKER_04]: I did play.

764
00:53:31,396 --> 00:53:32,196
[SPEAKER_04]: Tara said the Beatles won.

765
00:53:33,496 --> 00:53:39,961
[SPEAKER_13]: Hey, reuniting who Microsoft did on stage, that was an impressive feat for their press conference, so I do give Microsoft props for that.

766
00:53:40,421 --> 00:53:41,582
[SPEAKER_13]: Loki, you did find a shitty game?

767
00:53:41,622 --> 00:53:51,548
[SPEAKER_14]: I did find a shitty game, and I can't remember what, it's like, it's a Konami game, surprise, but it was actually, it was like Zephyr the Elemental or something like that.

768
00:53:52,029 --> 00:54:02,656
[SPEAKER_14]: It was supposed to be, it was the one that they had, it was like Tornado something or other was the working title for it, and it's supposed to be like Katamari where you're this, you know, tornado, and you

769
00:54:03,574 --> 00:54:06,817
[SPEAKER_14]: Knock over things and you get bigger as you collect more things.

770
00:54:06,837 --> 00:54:08,299
[SPEAKER_13]: Isn't this game already on Xbox Live Marketplace?

771
00:54:08,339 --> 00:54:09,419
[SPEAKER_05]: It should be a Vornado game.

772
00:54:09,940 --> 00:54:11,621
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, basically, and it sucked.

773
00:54:11,962 --> 00:54:12,742
[SPEAKER_14]: It was boring.

774
00:54:12,903 --> 00:54:14,684
[SPEAKER_14]: So, no, I don't like that game.

775
00:54:15,024 --> 00:54:16,606
[SPEAKER_14]: That is my stinker game of V3.

776
00:54:17,386 --> 00:54:20,789
[SPEAKER_13]: I feel the need to say something nice about Konami because we've been giving them a hard time.

777
00:54:20,890 --> 00:54:25,133
[SPEAKER_13]: And to be fair, Konami did show a couple of great things at the show.

778
00:54:25,413 --> 00:54:27,996
[SPEAKER_13]: So before we get into the press conferences, to be fair, I want to say this.

779
00:54:29,039 --> 00:54:29,760
[SPEAKER_13]: Thanks for watching!

780
00:54:44,059 --> 00:54:44,640
[SPEAKER_13]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

781
00:55:04,818 --> 00:55:11,240
[SPEAKER_13]: Like, you know, seeing that scene where the guy reaches in the toilet and pulls his hand up and he's got all the needles in it, that's just nasty, okay?

782
00:55:11,300 --> 00:55:20,502
[SPEAKER_13]: But there's people out there for the that's just nasty, and I gotta say, if you're a Fangoria-type person, Saw is probably going to appeal to you.

783
00:55:20,883 --> 00:55:21,743
[SPEAKER_13]: It's not terrible.

784
00:55:21,983 --> 00:55:26,944
[SPEAKER_05]: I still would never put any money into it, even if it was the best game on the planet, just so I don't support the franchise.

785
00:55:28,285 --> 00:55:29,365
[SPEAKER_05]: Seriously, that's how I feel.

786
00:55:29,733 --> 00:55:35,935
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, I'm trying to put the personal thoughts on that aside and just evaluate the game itself.

787
00:55:39,276 --> 00:55:43,858
[SPEAKER_13]: Considering it's a movie tie-in game, it looks like it's raising the bar on those a little bit.

788
00:55:44,118 --> 00:55:47,039
[SPEAKER_05]: I just don't think I can in good conscience say anything positive about it.

789
00:55:48,564 --> 00:55:59,232
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright, well, I do want to say though, a game that was incredible at Konami's booth that I played, and not quite my favorite game of the show, but just about my favorite game of the show was Silent Hill Shattered Memories on the Wii.

790
00:56:00,073 --> 00:56:03,275
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh my gosh, this game was great.

791
00:56:03,856 --> 00:56:10,861
[SPEAKER_13]: Especially, and I hate to say this, but for a Wii game, like it's, it was really, I love the concept.

792
00:56:10,881 --> 00:56:11,661
[SPEAKER_00]: It runs really smooth.

793
00:56:11,681 --> 00:56:15,865
[SPEAKER_13]: It runs smooth, it looks nice, you know, it doesn't look

794
00:56:17,153 --> 00:56:18,235
[SPEAKER_13]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

795
00:56:33,337 --> 00:56:34,798
[SPEAKER_13]: I love the way it controlled.

796
00:56:35,138 --> 00:56:40,500
[SPEAKER_13]: It was definitely kind of scary in parts, like when the things would jump out of the darkness on you.

797
00:56:41,020 --> 00:56:47,143
[SPEAKER_13]: I think the game is going to piss off hardcore fans of the Silent Hill because it looks like they've really changed up this first game.

798
00:56:47,503 --> 00:56:48,144
[SPEAKER_13]: But you know what?

799
00:56:48,704 --> 00:56:49,244
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm okay with it.

800
00:56:49,984 --> 00:56:53,366
[SPEAKER_13]: As someone who is casually a Silent Hill fan, I think it's pretty cool.

801
00:56:54,387 --> 00:56:55,848
[SPEAKER_13]: I like some of the changes they've made.

802
00:56:56,889 --> 00:56:57,970
[SPEAKER_13]: It's engrossing.

803
00:56:58,090 --> 00:56:58,810
[SPEAKER_13]: It's scary.

804
00:56:59,291 --> 00:57:03,615
[SPEAKER_13]: It's going to be a lot of fun, and it's a good non-party Wii game.

805
00:57:04,075 --> 00:57:04,595
[SPEAKER_13]: Hooray!

806
00:57:05,056 --> 00:57:09,720
[SPEAKER_05]: This is what I have to say for people who fuss just because of changes.

807
00:57:10,561 --> 00:57:13,363
[SPEAKER_05]: Without change, we'd have stagnation, and with stagnation, we'd have death.

808
00:57:14,364 --> 00:57:19,028
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you want the franchise to die, then don't look forward to any changes in it.

809
00:57:19,768 --> 00:57:20,029
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't be...

810
00:57:21,786 --> 00:57:22,887
[SPEAKER_13]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

811
00:57:39,895 --> 00:57:40,676
[SPEAKER_05]: She was kind of a hoe.

812
00:57:41,276 --> 00:57:42,437
[SPEAKER_05]: Honestly, whatever.

813
00:57:42,457 --> 00:57:43,757
[SPEAKER_14]: The game was fun.

814
00:57:43,817 --> 00:57:48,760
[SPEAKER_14]: The changes are being made based on how you answer some of this personality stuff.

815
00:57:48,800 --> 00:57:50,621
[SPEAKER_14]: So it kind of changes it.

816
00:57:50,701 --> 00:57:58,406
[SPEAKER_14]: It's almost like how different things manifest based on the characters' intentions and desires and that kind of stuff.

817
00:57:58,426 --> 00:57:59,767
[SPEAKER_13]: There's some pretty personal stuff in there.

818
00:57:59,787 --> 00:58:01,027
[SPEAKER_05]: I remember Silent Hill 2.

819
00:58:01,108 --> 00:58:02,608
[SPEAKER_05]: The little girl never saw any of the...

820
00:58:03,769 --> 00:58:04,950
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

821
00:58:22,970 --> 00:58:24,552
[SPEAKER_13]: Have you ever roleplayed during sex?

822
00:58:24,592 --> 00:58:26,454
[SPEAKER_13]: And all these very personal questions.

823
00:58:26,735 --> 00:58:30,839
[SPEAKER_13]: And of course, as I was taking it, I was trying to make myself sound like the most messed up person on the planet.

824
00:58:32,261 --> 00:58:34,023
[SPEAKER_13]: So, you know, I'm curious.

825
00:58:34,143 --> 00:58:37,147
[SPEAKER_13]: I didn't really see what impact that's going to have on the game, but it looked interesting.

826
00:58:37,748 --> 00:58:37,848
[SPEAKER_13]: So...

827
00:58:39,039 --> 00:58:41,460
[SPEAKER_13]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

828
00:58:54,588 --> 00:58:56,369
[SPEAKER_13]: Unfolded Raptor talking about the Saw game.

829
00:58:56,389 --> 00:59:03,951
[SPEAKER_13]: There is one where you have to close stalled doors and read the backwards number in the bloodstained mirror in the room and put in the combination for the lock in order to get to the next room.

830
00:59:03,991 --> 00:59:08,313
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, that puzzle was in the demo and it was an interesting puzzle.

831
00:59:08,453 --> 00:59:10,733
[SPEAKER_13]: It was kind of a neat little gameplay mechanic.

832
00:59:10,773 --> 00:59:11,394
[SPEAKER_13]: I thought it was cool.

833
00:59:12,234 --> 00:59:17,676
[SPEAKER_13]: GS68 says, well, they didn't show gore, I think he meant to say, but they showed 3D stuff and some disgusting shit.

834
00:59:18,076 --> 00:59:21,437
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's why I don't think in the end I could actually play the Saw game.

835
00:59:22,369 --> 00:59:31,771
[SPEAKER_13]: But, you know, the parts I saw where people weren't losing looked just fine, but I don't think I'd be able to play the game myself.

836
00:59:32,352 --> 00:59:34,572
[SPEAKER_13]: Isn't that weird, to kind of say that about a video game?

837
00:59:34,912 --> 00:59:35,152
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

838
00:59:35,632 --> 00:59:38,913
[SPEAKER_13]: It might be nice for those of you that are into that kind of thing, but not me.

839
00:59:40,554 --> 00:59:41,734
[SPEAKER_05]: Whatever sinks your battleship.

840
00:59:42,174 --> 00:59:42,694
[SPEAKER_13]: Exactly.

841
00:59:43,774 --> 00:59:45,835
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm sorry, GS68 wasn't talking about the Saw game.

842
00:59:47,487 --> 00:59:50,189
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh god, he was talking about Faname 2009 Hentai Room.

843
00:59:50,369 --> 00:59:51,090
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, sorry about that.

844
00:59:51,130 --> 00:59:53,492
[SPEAKER_13]: I was looking up the notes there.

845
00:59:54,853 --> 00:59:57,534
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm sure the Saw game has some pretty disgusting shit in it too.

846
00:59:57,554 --> 00:59:58,455
[SPEAKER_13]: In fact, I know it does.

847
00:59:58,535 --> 00:59:59,676
[SPEAKER_13]: I did see some disgusting shit.

848
00:59:59,696 --> 01:00:06,041
[SPEAKER_14]: Real quick, before we go on to the conferences, I was going to mention some of the other announcements from Konami real quick.

849
01:00:07,722 --> 01:00:10,644
[SPEAKER_14]: Of course, some stuff that actually didn't make the keynotes.

850
01:00:11,745 --> 01:00:16,168
[SPEAKER_14]: Kojima Productions announced Metal Gear Solid or Metal Gear Arcade.

851
01:00:18,191 --> 01:00:18,451
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

852
01:00:18,791 --> 01:00:19,612
[SPEAKER_14]: Which is kind of neat.

853
01:00:19,932 --> 01:00:28,955
[SPEAKER_14]: And they also, you may remember there was that Castlevania type game that they were previewing that wasn't really Castlevania.

854
01:00:29,015 --> 01:00:30,335
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, it ended up being Castlevania.

855
01:00:30,655 --> 01:00:32,996
[SPEAKER_14]: And it's actually being done by Kojima, which is pretty cool.

856
01:00:33,056 --> 01:00:33,737
[SPEAKER_05]: I know.

857
01:00:33,917 --> 01:00:35,197
[SPEAKER_05]: I heard about that.

858
01:00:35,217 --> 01:00:36,097
[SPEAKER_14]: That's going to be cool.

859
01:00:36,137 --> 01:00:37,518
[SPEAKER_13]: And Patrick Stewart is a voice in it.

860
01:00:37,987 --> 01:00:40,049
[SPEAKER_05]: That makes it infinitely cool.

861
01:00:40,149 --> 01:00:43,151
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, so that was definitely a big yay from Konami.

862
01:00:43,511 --> 01:00:45,513
[SPEAKER_13]: Do you wonder if he's going to be Dracula?

863
01:00:46,093 --> 01:00:46,434
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know.

864
01:00:46,454 --> 01:00:48,255
[SPEAKER_05]: Could you imagine Patrick Stewart as Dracula?

865
01:00:48,675 --> 01:00:51,017
[SPEAKER_13]: I hope this is a game that's showing up on the floor next year.

866
01:00:51,258 --> 01:00:52,559
[SPEAKER_05]: That would be fantastic.

867
01:00:52,579 --> 01:00:54,800
[SPEAKER_05]: Because he can do the scary voice.

868
01:00:54,820 --> 01:00:58,643
[SPEAKER_14]: Patrick Warburton as one of the Belmonts.

869
01:01:00,024 --> 01:01:00,625
[SPEAKER_14]: That would be funny.

870
01:01:02,393 --> 01:01:04,134
[SPEAKER_05]: I hope we don't get the die monster.

871
01:01:04,194 --> 01:01:12,117
[SPEAKER_14]: And then of course, to kind of go back to music games, also Konami announced that they are bringing over that poppin' music for Wii with no controller.

872
01:01:12,217 --> 01:01:19,180
[SPEAKER_13]: Once again, really not... Meaning it's not poppin' music like you folks that have been following Konami for 10 years will think it is.

873
01:01:19,360 --> 01:01:20,541
[SPEAKER_13]: So don't... You know what?

874
01:01:20,701 --> 01:01:22,882
[SPEAKER_13]: Do yourself a favor, hardcore Bomani fans.

875
01:01:23,302 --> 01:01:26,563
[SPEAKER_13]: Don't think of this game as poppin' music because you are just going to be disappointed.

876
01:01:26,864 --> 01:01:27,464
[SPEAKER_13]: And don't buy it.

877
01:01:28,376 --> 01:01:32,020
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, it's not fair to say that until I've actually had my hands on it playing it.

878
01:01:32,240 --> 01:01:37,205
[SPEAKER_13]: So I'm not going to say that, but I'm going to say don't think of it as poppy music because you're only going to set yourself up for disappointment.

879
01:01:37,766 --> 01:01:37,986
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

880
01:01:39,648 --> 01:01:40,949
[SPEAKER_14]: But Lorde's a shadow looker.

881
01:01:43,086 --> 01:01:43,947
[SPEAKER_14]: That's a Castlevania game.

882
01:01:44,607 --> 01:01:47,449
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright, so let's talk about press conferences here.

883
01:01:47,469 --> 01:01:48,389
[SPEAKER_13]: We're an hour into the show.

884
01:01:48,409 --> 01:01:50,130
[SPEAKER_13]: We haven't even touched on a single press conference yet.

885
01:01:50,170 --> 01:01:52,432
[SPEAKER_13]: So let's talk about the big press conferences so far.

886
01:01:52,452 --> 01:01:53,692
[SPEAKER_13]: Where do we want to start?

887
01:01:53,712 --> 01:01:54,433
[SPEAKER_13]: How about Nintendo?

888
01:01:54,453 --> 01:01:56,074
[SPEAKER_13]: I guess we were ragging on Nintendo a little bit.

889
01:01:56,094 --> 01:01:56,734
[SPEAKER_13]: We'll start with them.

890
01:01:57,655 --> 01:01:58,935
[SPEAKER_05]: Yay, I like ragging on Nintendo.

891
01:01:59,035 --> 01:01:59,916
[SPEAKER_13]: Some of the things that they mentioned.

892
01:01:59,936 --> 01:02:01,697
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, not all the news was bad out of Nintendo.

893
01:02:01,737 --> 01:02:03,678
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, certainly Metroid Other M. How about this?

894
01:02:03,898 --> 01:02:07,440
[SPEAKER_13]: Team Ninja teams up with Nintendo to put out the next Metroid game.

895
01:02:07,460 --> 01:02:08,921
[SPEAKER_13]: But Team Ninja's lacking.

896
01:02:09,482 --> 01:02:11,403
[SPEAKER_14]: The only good announcement out of

897
01:02:12,634 --> 01:02:13,755
[SPEAKER_14]: Out of their press conference.

898
01:02:13,935 --> 01:02:18,317
[SPEAKER_14]: And seriously, if they hadn't announced this, I would have had no hope for them.

899
01:02:20,038 --> 01:02:24,041
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, this was definitely the thing to cater to the hardcore gamers.

900
01:02:24,221 --> 01:02:27,223
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, it's a good example of how to revitalize your franchise.

901
01:02:27,463 --> 01:02:28,864
[SPEAKER_14]: Have someone else do it.

902
01:02:29,364 --> 01:02:31,205
[SPEAKER_05]: But we don't have Itagaki.

903
01:02:32,987 --> 01:02:33,688
[SPEAKER_13]: Samus will have boob mechanics

904
01:02:48,206 --> 01:02:52,931
[SPEAKER_13]: Prime was alright, but yeah, I was missing my 2D Metroid and this is going to give it to me.

905
01:02:53,051 --> 01:02:54,853
[SPEAKER_14]: Prime did not do it for me.

906
01:02:55,173 --> 01:02:59,377
[SPEAKER_14]: I just couldn't get in the Prime and corruptions, you know, it looked kind of dumb.

907
01:03:00,879 --> 01:03:01,700
[SPEAKER_14]: But this looks awesome.

908
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:04,723
[SPEAKER_14]: This looks like something I could actually play and would want to play.

909
01:03:06,069 --> 01:03:06,549
[SPEAKER_13]: Thanks for watching!

910
01:03:28,137 --> 01:03:28,717
[SPEAKER_14]: It's stupid.

911
01:03:29,017 --> 01:03:30,378
[SPEAKER_14]: You know why it's stupid?

912
01:03:30,478 --> 01:03:32,919
[SPEAKER_14]: It's because it's just porting basically the game from the DS.

913
01:03:33,359 --> 01:03:48,744
[SPEAKER_14]: And yeah, I know it's a new game and stuff, but really, unless you're really into party games and really into playing this with four people at once, which, that's fine, because the Wii is for a lot of people that want to do party games and stuff like that.

914
01:03:48,984 --> 01:03:52,065
[SPEAKER_14]: But I just couldn't see myself breaking this out at a party and playing this game.

915
01:03:52,425 --> 01:03:55,266
[SPEAKER_14]: It'd be like the regular new Super Mario Bros.

916
01:03:55,426 --> 01:03:56,526
[SPEAKER_14]: I played through it myself.

917
01:03:58,188 --> 01:03:58,688
[SPEAKER_14]: And that's it.

918
01:03:58,868 --> 01:04:02,630
[SPEAKER_14]: This game, if I play through it myself, I'm not going to really get anything out of it.

919
01:04:02,890 --> 01:04:03,710
[SPEAKER_14]: And that's the problem.

920
01:04:04,870 --> 01:04:06,631
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, I played this on the show floor, like I said.

921
01:04:06,671 --> 01:04:07,351
[SPEAKER_13]: And it was fun.

922
01:04:07,831 --> 01:04:09,172
[SPEAKER_13]: It's neat.

923
01:04:09,192 --> 01:04:11,853
[SPEAKER_13]: Playing with four people, it was a lot of fun and very competitive.

924
01:04:12,193 --> 01:04:13,473
[SPEAKER_13]: But don't be mistaken, folks.

925
01:04:13,754 --> 01:04:15,994
[SPEAKER_13]: This is another party game on the Wii.

926
01:04:16,735 --> 01:04:17,835
[SPEAKER_13]: In Mario's clothing.

927
01:04:18,475 --> 01:04:20,336
[SPEAKER_14]: And don't call this New Super Mario Bros.

928
01:04:20,356 --> 01:04:21,896
[SPEAKER_14]: because you just ported this shit.

929
01:04:22,037 --> 01:04:23,177
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not new.

930
01:04:23,417 --> 01:04:24,297
[SPEAKER_14]: It's ported.

931
01:04:24,397 --> 01:04:25,418
[SPEAKER_14]: Slightly recycled.

932
01:04:27,142 --> 01:04:28,263
[SPEAKER_13]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

933
01:04:48,473 --> 01:04:49,174
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, awesome.

934
01:04:49,194 --> 01:04:50,294
[SPEAKER_13]: That's not really the focus.

935
01:04:50,675 --> 01:04:51,635
[SPEAKER_13]: That's very nice.

936
01:04:52,076 --> 01:04:53,137
[SPEAKER_13]: Here's the thing that I didn't really get.

937
01:04:53,157 --> 01:04:57,060
[SPEAKER_13]: To be fair, that wasn't really the focus of the demo they were showing or not really the focus of the game.

938
01:04:57,480 --> 01:05:03,865
[SPEAKER_13]: My opinion of what she said was that's not really the focus of the game because if there was a single player mode, they would have shown it somewhere.

939
01:05:04,085 --> 01:05:05,126
[SPEAKER_13]: But that's not what they were showing.

940
01:05:05,146 --> 01:05:06,947
[SPEAKER_13]: They were showing this four player party thing.

941
01:05:07,507 --> 01:05:09,989
[SPEAKER_13]: And strangely enough, it's not online.

942
01:05:11,010 --> 01:05:14,292
[SPEAKER_13]: They had the perfect opportunity to have a fun little online game and it's not online.

943
01:05:14,312 --> 01:05:22,939
[SPEAKER_14]: I love it because, as Bobby was saying in his show, because the processing power of the Wii can't handle online with this type of game.

944
01:05:23,419 --> 01:05:25,981
[SPEAKER_14]: It can't handle online with this type of game.

945
01:05:27,162 --> 01:05:27,362
[SPEAKER_14]: What?

946
01:05:28,680 --> 01:05:30,221
[SPEAKER_13]: Didn't Brawl do that?

947
01:05:30,841 --> 01:05:31,182
[SPEAKER_13]: What?

948
01:05:32,583 --> 01:05:34,304
[SPEAKER_13]: What the hell was this one they just had on the GameCube?

949
01:05:34,344 --> 01:05:34,904
[SPEAKER_13]: Smash Bros.

950
01:05:35,044 --> 01:05:35,705
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, Smash Bros.

951
01:05:35,725 --> 01:05:36,005
[SPEAKER_13]: Brawl.

952
01:05:36,225 --> 01:05:38,526
[SPEAKER_13]: Wii, yeah.

953
01:05:38,766 --> 01:05:39,507
[SPEAKER_13]: That was online.

954
01:05:39,547 --> 01:05:41,028
[SPEAKER_13]: It was laggy sometimes, so they did it.

955
01:05:42,049 --> 01:05:43,990
[SPEAKER_13]: Did this other game have much more than that?

956
01:05:44,010 --> 01:05:44,230
[SPEAKER_13]: Smash Bros.

957
01:05:44,250 --> 01:05:44,750
[SPEAKER_14]: Brawl, yeah.

958
01:05:47,132 --> 01:05:48,753
[SPEAKER_14]: They can't handle online?

959
01:05:50,216 --> 01:05:51,736
[SPEAKER_14]: Then you need better programmers!

960
01:05:51,917 --> 01:05:54,617
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm sorry, but it's a 2D game, okay?

961
01:05:55,077 --> 01:06:01,319
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a 2D game with very low polys, and you can't handle four people online?

962
01:06:02,800 --> 01:06:08,301
[SPEAKER_14]: Mario Kart can handle four people online, and that's way more complex than this game.

963
01:06:08,962 --> 01:06:10,582
[SPEAKER_14]: Why can't you handle four people online?

964
01:06:10,722 --> 01:06:12,903
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, I know why, because you don't want to embrace online.

965
01:06:12,923 --> 01:06:14,443
[SPEAKER_14]: That's really the reason behind it.

966
01:06:14,783 --> 01:06:19,885
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not because it's a technical limitation, because if it was a technical limitation, I'm sure you'd find a way around it.

967
01:06:20,327 --> 01:06:21,528
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's a personal limitation.

968
01:06:22,348 --> 01:06:27,810
[SPEAKER_14]: It's because the person that's going to buy this game isn't probably really into online.

969
01:06:27,830 --> 01:06:29,551
[SPEAKER_14]: They're probably into soccer.

970
01:06:29,691 --> 01:06:31,512
[SPEAKER_14]: And they probably are a mom.

971
01:06:35,152 --> 01:06:38,796
[SPEAKER_13]: AlphaKananaGram in chat says, Rob, they said that is the game.

972
01:06:39,096 --> 01:06:41,419
[SPEAKER_13]: With extra players joining in and leaving at any time.

973
01:06:41,479 --> 01:06:43,021
[SPEAKER_13]: So yeah, that is the game.

974
01:06:43,321 --> 01:06:44,502
[SPEAKER_13]: That's exactly what I'm saying.

975
01:06:44,622 --> 01:06:45,323
[SPEAKER_13]: Don't be fooled.

976
01:06:45,383 --> 01:06:46,384
[SPEAKER_13]: This is a party game.

977
01:06:46,725 --> 01:06:47,786
[SPEAKER_13]: At least Smash Bros.

978
01:06:47,866 --> 01:06:50,849
[SPEAKER_13]: Brawl had a single player mode that was pretty extensive and fun.

979
01:06:51,650 --> 01:06:58,237
[SPEAKER_13]: All I'm saying is that if there is, you know, to be fair to Nintendo, if there is a single player fun bonanza in here, I just have yet to see it.

980
01:06:58,657 --> 01:07:02,241
[SPEAKER_13]: So if you are thinking you're excited about this game, that's cool.

981
01:07:02,581 --> 01:07:04,823
[SPEAKER_13]: I hope you have friends to play it with regularly.

982
01:07:05,404 --> 01:07:10,349
[SPEAKER_14]: When I saw this one, they were like, oh, we have new Super Mario Brothers now on the Wii coming this holiday.

983
01:07:10,369 --> 01:07:12,070
[SPEAKER_14]: I was like, whoop-dee-shit.

984
01:07:13,552 --> 01:07:15,514
[SPEAKER_05]: There's also people, though, that I just hope you have friends.

985
01:07:16,806 --> 01:07:21,027
[SPEAKER_14]: It's like, you know, oh, we've been waiting for another Mario Brothers game on the Wii.

986
01:07:21,148 --> 01:07:22,648
[SPEAKER_14]: Woo!

987
01:07:23,088 --> 01:07:24,629
[SPEAKER_14]: New Super Mario Brothers.

988
01:07:25,069 --> 01:07:25,649
[SPEAKER_14]: Awesome!

989
01:07:25,949 --> 01:07:27,090
[SPEAKER_14]: No, I'm sorry, that wasn't awesome.

990
01:07:27,190 --> 01:07:32,471
[SPEAKER_13]: TigerClaw in chat says, yeah, Nintendo's forgetting that there are many of us who don't know people in the neighborhood that own the same system.

991
01:07:32,531 --> 01:07:33,852
[SPEAKER_13]: So yeah, you're pretty much all alone.

992
01:07:35,017 --> 01:07:35,477
[SPEAKER_14]: Super Mario Galaxy 2

993
01:07:58,604 --> 01:07:59,605
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you for watching!

994
01:08:23,786 --> 01:08:24,847
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, Yoshi's in it now!

995
01:08:25,067 --> 01:08:26,128
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, my mistake!

996
01:08:26,308 --> 01:08:27,009
[SPEAKER_14]: Yoshi's in this.

997
01:08:27,069 --> 01:08:28,470
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, obviously it's a sequel now.

998
01:08:30,172 --> 01:08:33,574
[SPEAKER_14]: But, I mean, really, they didn't do that much to it.

999
01:08:33,715 --> 01:08:40,841
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, whereas, you know, like Super Mario World, you know, Super Mario World 1 and 2, I mean, those were very different games.

1000
01:08:40,901 --> 01:08:42,282
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, they were really different games.

1001
01:08:42,442 --> 01:08:45,645
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, granted, World 2 was kind of annoying, but, um...

1002
01:08:48,643 --> 01:08:49,844
[SPEAKER_13]: Really with the crying baby?

1003
01:08:50,625 --> 01:08:52,929
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, just mute the damn TV if it gets to you.

1004
01:08:53,189 --> 01:08:55,994
[SPEAKER_13]: Or don't suck so much and keep losing the baby.

1005
01:08:56,114 --> 01:08:57,195
[SPEAKER_13]: Then you won't hear it cry.

1006
01:08:59,278 --> 01:09:04,006
[SPEAKER_13]: That's what Mario Galaxy 2 needs, a crying baby on the back of Yoshi.

1007
01:09:05,779 --> 01:09:06,960
[SPEAKER_13]: Touch Fuzzy, Get Dizzy

1008
01:09:35,874 --> 01:09:36,154
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

1009
01:09:36,935 --> 01:09:39,638
[SPEAKER_13]: Interlogic in chat says, okay, there's a lot of yelling going on.

1010
01:09:39,678 --> 01:09:42,241
[SPEAKER_13]: How about switching to a subject that can let everyone relax?

1011
01:09:42,361 --> 01:09:43,623
[SPEAKER_04]: How about we use our inside voices?

1012
01:09:43,663 --> 01:09:45,104
[SPEAKER_13]: Maybe 3DO talk.

1013
01:09:46,265 --> 01:09:46,626
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

1014
01:09:46,986 --> 01:09:50,170
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, just for you, Interlogic, let me ask Loki about this little gem here.

1015
01:09:50,270 --> 01:09:56,096
[SPEAKER_13]: One big thing that Nintendo had to unveil at their press conference, the Wii Vitality Sensor.

1016
01:09:56,456 --> 01:09:56,476
[SPEAKER_13]: I...

1017
01:09:58,092 --> 01:10:00,494
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you for watching!

1018
01:10:19,810 --> 01:10:20,110
[SPEAKER_14]: What?

1019
01:10:20,811 --> 01:10:23,114
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Nintendo, for giving us shit we don't need.

1020
01:10:23,174 --> 01:10:25,536
[SPEAKER_14]: Like, they're all... It's going to take the gaming to the next level.

1021
01:10:25,937 --> 01:10:28,119
[SPEAKER_14]: For geriatrics, maybe.

1022
01:10:28,700 --> 01:10:29,300
[SPEAKER_05]: Seriously.

1023
01:10:29,380 --> 01:10:30,922
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a heart monitor for Wii Fit.

1024
01:10:31,723 --> 01:10:33,985
[SPEAKER_13]: Dude, I can give myself an electrocardiogram on the Wii now.

1025
01:10:34,005 --> 01:10:34,406
[SPEAKER_14]: No, seriously.

1026
01:10:34,446 --> 01:10:36,148
[SPEAKER_14]: They're like, it's going to allow you...

1027
01:10:37,489 --> 01:10:38,049
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura.com

1028
01:10:58,450 --> 01:11:06,094
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm sorry, all they're going to do is come out with another game that's going to have some mini-games based on this accessory, and then that's it.

1029
01:11:06,234 --> 01:11:09,575
[SPEAKER_12]: Imagine the WarioWare with the Wii Vitality Sensor.

1030
01:11:11,936 --> 01:11:14,037
[SPEAKER_12]: Some of the mini-games stop beating.

1031
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:20,440
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm sorry, it's going to be dumb.

1032
01:11:20,721 --> 01:11:27,244
[SPEAKER_14]: And what also makes it dumb is they should have done this Bluetooth or something like that so that you can utilize it with...

1033
01:11:28,769 --> 01:11:29,750
[SPEAKER_14]: Thanks for watching!

1034
01:11:47,893 --> 01:11:54,818
[SPEAKER_14]: How long may I ask before we hear about an injury where someone has inserted their penis into the Wii Vitality Sensor?

1035
01:11:55,058 --> 01:11:57,640
[SPEAKER_14]: Because I bet you anything someone will do that.

1036
01:11:58,060 --> 01:12:05,565
[SPEAKER_14]: Because if it's got some sort of way to attach to something, someone's going to try to stick their penis in there.

1037
01:12:06,025 --> 01:12:07,346
[SPEAKER_14]: And that's what's going to happen.

1038
01:12:08,867 --> 01:12:10,608
[SPEAKER_14]: That's immediately what I thought when I saw it.

1039
01:12:10,648 --> 01:12:13,310
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm like, how long is it going to take before someone sticks their penis in that?

1040
01:12:13,470 --> 01:12:14,631
[SPEAKER_14]: I know that's going to happen.

1041
01:12:17,702 --> 01:12:19,043
[SPEAKER_05]: I think you just made Rob hurt.

1042
01:12:21,044 --> 01:12:21,484
[SPEAKER_13]: I hurt.

1043
01:12:43,977 --> 01:12:47,420
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, Grandma made Jello tonight.

1044
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:50,061
[SPEAKER_12]: How long before someone puts their dick in it?

1045
01:12:50,862 --> 01:12:51,582
[SPEAKER_12]: Exactly.

1046
01:12:52,623 --> 01:12:53,524
[SPEAKER_05]: Mashed potatoes?

1047
01:12:53,824 --> 01:12:56,426
[SPEAKER_05]: See, now all we need is to talk about farting and we'll be cool.

1048
01:12:56,506 --> 01:13:01,209
[SPEAKER_14]: And then I'd like to finish off the rest of their wonderful conference.

1049
01:13:01,469 --> 01:13:05,972
[SPEAKER_14]: They talked about Wii Sports Resort, and they talked about the new games they're in, which are fine.

1050
01:13:05,992 --> 01:13:06,273
[SPEAKER_14]: They're neat.

1051
01:13:08,594 --> 01:13:09,875
[SPEAKER_14]: WeMotionPlus WeFitPlus

1052
01:13:36,527 --> 01:13:40,148
[SPEAKER_14]: and some online data sharing or something like that.

1053
01:13:40,328 --> 01:13:41,468
[SPEAKER_14]: Whoop-dee-doo!

1054
01:13:41,948 --> 01:13:42,388
[SPEAKER_14]: But guess what?

1055
01:13:42,408 --> 01:13:49,350
[SPEAKER_14]: They're going to have new bundles and people are going to be dumb and not realize that it's actually the same game they just bought and they're going to buy it all over again.

1056
01:13:50,910 --> 01:13:54,470
[SPEAKER_13]: Frisbee says, now that's what I call touch generation games.

1057
01:13:57,871 --> 01:14:01,812
[SPEAKER_13]: Although, Rez with the Wii Vitality Sensor might be kind of fun.

1058
01:14:03,561 --> 01:14:05,583
[SPEAKER_13]: All right, other things at a Nintendo's press conference.

1059
01:14:05,663 --> 01:14:06,803
[SPEAKER_13]: Wii Sports Resort.

1060
01:14:06,864 --> 01:14:08,505
[SPEAKER_13]: I actually played this game on the floor.

1061
01:14:08,625 --> 01:14:12,147
[SPEAKER_13]: I played the archery game, which was, you know.

1062
01:14:13,588 --> 01:14:14,829
[SPEAKER_13]: What can I say about Wii Sports?

1063
01:14:14,889 --> 01:14:18,251
[SPEAKER_13]: It's the type of thing that's fun at a party when I have friends over.

1064
01:14:18,311 --> 01:14:19,532
[SPEAKER_13]: Hey, let's play Wii Sports.

1065
01:14:19,572 --> 01:14:25,536
[SPEAKER_13]: Let's have a little competition, you know, because we're at a party and drinking, so we can't go outside and play, so let's do some Wii Sports.

1066
01:14:25,956 --> 01:14:28,557
[SPEAKER_13]: But I don't think I would ever play this by myself.

1067
01:14:28,618 --> 01:14:29,278
[SPEAKER_13]: Like, hey, I'm bored.

1068
01:14:29,298 --> 01:14:30,399
[SPEAKER_13]: I want to shoot archery.

1069
01:14:30,839 --> 01:14:32,420
[SPEAKER_14]: Did you ever figure out?

1070
01:14:33,999 --> 01:14:35,940
[SPEAKER_14]: What exactly would MotionPlus does?

1071
01:14:36,481 --> 01:14:39,663
[SPEAKER_13]: It looks like it just allows motion detection in more places.

1072
01:14:39,943 --> 01:14:47,689
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, to be honest, the archery thing did feel natural, and I think with the controller they have today, it would have been a little bit shaky.

1073
01:14:47,709 --> 01:14:53,473
[SPEAKER_14]: Because we remember way back, we did play archery in DECA Sports.

1074
01:14:53,533 --> 01:14:55,594
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

1075
01:14:56,195 --> 01:14:57,476
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know if you remember that that much.

1076
01:14:57,536 --> 01:15:02,419
[SPEAKER_13]: Not really, but I seem to recall there was more, I don't know, it just seemed more precision.

1077
01:15:02,679 --> 01:15:02,999
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know.

1078
01:15:03,939 --> 01:15:04,359
[SPEAKER_13]: Thanks for watching!

1079
01:15:22,176 --> 01:15:23,096
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, but whatever.

1080
01:15:23,717 --> 01:15:25,637
[SPEAKER_13]: That's part of the give and take of E3.

1081
01:15:25,978 --> 01:15:28,999
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, so I can't base my entire judgment of this game off of what I played.

1082
01:15:29,379 --> 01:15:37,062
[SPEAKER_13]: However, you know, again, I didn't see anything that made me go, oh, you know, I need this game.

1083
01:15:37,582 --> 01:15:39,403
[SPEAKER_14]: Red Seal 2, though, looked awesome.

1084
01:15:40,103 --> 01:15:40,403
[SPEAKER_13]: How so?

1085
01:15:40,443 --> 01:15:41,744
[SPEAKER_14]: I didn't really check that out.

1086
01:15:41,964 --> 01:15:44,125
[SPEAKER_14]: It ran really smooth, 60 frames per second.

1087
01:15:44,145 --> 01:15:47,846
[SPEAKER_14]: The Wii Motion Plus and sword tracking really worked.

1088
01:15:48,767 --> 01:15:49,507
[SPEAKER_14]: And it looked fun.

1089
01:15:50,167 --> 01:15:51,428
[SPEAKER_14]: Unlike Red Seal 1, which...

1090
01:15:52,645 --> 01:15:55,808
[SPEAKER_13]: DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen

1091
01:16:09,079 --> 01:16:10,439
[SPEAKER_13]: More for people who don't already own it.

1092
01:16:10,919 --> 01:16:13,500
[SPEAKER_13]: I can't see myself... I mean, it really depends on the price point.

1093
01:16:13,540 --> 01:16:15,401
[SPEAKER_13]: I didn't see how much they were going to charge for this game.

1094
01:16:15,501 --> 01:16:22,422
[SPEAKER_13]: I can't see myself paying a lot of money for it if it's not going to give me anything that special, if that makes sense.

1095
01:16:22,522 --> 01:16:23,663
[SPEAKER_13]: It's just more minigames.

1096
01:16:23,843 --> 01:16:24,863
[SPEAKER_05]: What if they make Wii LiPo?

1097
01:16:26,183 --> 01:16:26,924
[SPEAKER_13]: I'd probably buy it.

1098
01:16:27,044 --> 01:16:28,164
[SPEAKER_05]: Or Wii Gastric Bypass.

1099
01:16:28,888 --> 01:16:29,709
[SPEAKER_13]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1100
01:16:55,189 --> 01:16:57,630
[SPEAKER_13]: Depends how good that online functionality is.

1101
01:16:57,750 --> 01:17:02,052
[SPEAKER_13]: But based on what I saw, I don't really see anything that justifies $40.

1102
01:17:04,293 --> 01:17:06,454
[SPEAKER_13]: $20 maybe, but I highly doubt that's what they're charging for it.

1103
01:17:07,095 --> 01:17:07,995
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not going to be $20.

1104
01:17:08,555 --> 01:17:09,056
[SPEAKER_13]: Exactly.

1105
01:17:11,977 --> 01:17:12,457
[SPEAKER_13]: Let's see.

1106
01:17:12,817 --> 01:17:14,958
[SPEAKER_13]: What other kind of stuff was announced at Nintendo press conference?

1107
01:17:14,978 --> 01:17:16,799
[SPEAKER_13]: That's pretty much all that I have on my list.

1108
01:17:16,939 --> 01:17:22,062
[SPEAKER_14]: Other things announced that didn't quite make their press conference.

1109
01:17:23,072 --> 01:17:23,613
[SPEAKER_14]: New colors.

1110
01:17:24,054 --> 01:17:24,675
[SPEAKER_14]: That's right.

1111
01:17:24,795 --> 01:17:25,796
[SPEAKER_14]: It was about time.

1112
01:17:26,237 --> 01:17:30,223
[SPEAKER_14]: Now, Japan, during the summer, will be getting a black Wii.

1113
01:17:31,141 --> 01:17:34,922
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1114
01:18:00,250 --> 01:18:01,071
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1115
01:18:18,752 --> 01:18:19,833
[SPEAKER_14]: I didn't really know what they were.

1116
01:18:21,053 --> 01:18:22,054
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, other announcements.

1117
01:18:22,454 --> 01:18:26,836
[SPEAKER_14]: Obviously, DSi was getting Facebook support as well.

1118
01:18:27,776 --> 01:18:33,379
[SPEAKER_14]: They're going to allow you to upload pictures you take with the DSi camera to Facebook.

1119
01:18:33,579 --> 01:18:35,860
[SPEAKER_13]: As if there wasn't enough crap on my feed.

1120
01:18:36,894 --> 01:18:37,915
[SPEAKER_13]: I hope I can block it.

1121
01:18:53,348 --> 01:18:54,049
[SPEAKER_14]: WarioWare DIY WarioWare

1122
01:19:15,571 --> 01:19:23,813
[SPEAKER_14]: They've also announced Flipnote Studios for DSi this summer, which is also the motion notepad that they have in Japan right now.

1123
01:19:24,773 --> 01:19:29,854
[SPEAKER_14]: And New Mario and Luigi RPG, well, was it March of the Minis again?

1124
01:19:29,894 --> 01:19:32,374
[SPEAKER_14]: They're going to do another Mario vs. Donkey Kong game.

1125
01:19:32,434 --> 01:19:35,255
[SPEAKER_14]: I think that was going to be a DSi-only app or something like that.

1126
01:19:35,675 --> 01:19:36,655
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, that was the one that came out.

1127
01:19:36,895 --> 01:19:38,515
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's out tomorrow or something.

1128
01:19:38,815 --> 01:19:39,536
[SPEAKER_13]: Didn't they announce that?

1129
01:19:39,816 --> 01:19:40,636
[SPEAKER_13]: Something like that, yeah.

1130
01:19:40,796 --> 01:19:41,396
[SPEAKER_14]: It's out now.

1131
01:19:42,276 --> 01:19:43,157
[SPEAKER_14]: It was a download game.

1132
01:19:43,237 --> 01:19:43,897
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't have a DSi.

1133
01:19:44,118 --> 01:19:44,998
[SPEAKER_13]: Can I say this real quick?

1134
01:19:45,018 --> 01:19:47,200
[SPEAKER_13]: The chat room really wants us to mention Golden Sun.

1135
01:19:47,581 --> 01:19:51,164
[SPEAKER_13]: I saw a couple other people mentioning that before and SSJ100Mac kind of sums it up here.

1136
01:19:51,844 --> 01:19:56,809
[SPEAKER_13]: I got excited for a split second when they said at their press conference, an old franchise that was once gone is coming back.

1137
01:19:57,189 --> 01:19:59,871
[SPEAKER_13]: I thought maybe Mother 3 or Kid Icarus.

1138
01:20:01,032 --> 01:20:02,033
[SPEAKER_14]: I saw that too.

1139
01:20:02,053 --> 01:20:02,614
[SPEAKER_14]: That was funny.

1140
01:20:03,234 --> 01:20:04,535
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh yeah, they're going to announce Mother 3.

1141
01:20:04,595 --> 01:20:06,657
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, nope, they're not.

1142
01:20:06,937 --> 01:20:09,319
[SPEAKER_13]: Uh-uh.

1143
01:20:10,194 --> 01:20:12,375
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright, anything else you want to say about Nintendo's press conference?

1144
01:20:14,375 --> 01:20:17,196
[SPEAKER_14]: Um... It still sucked.

1145
01:20:17,376 --> 01:20:22,437
[SPEAKER_13]: Now, theRobD wants to point out, I'm really excited, I loved Golden Sun, this is a good thing, a very good thing.

1146
01:20:22,498 --> 01:20:32,040
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, I mean, the Golden Sun games are fun, but you have to admit, there's some folks that are going to feel that huge sense of disappointment, like, oh my god, I've been waiting forever for Kid Icarus, here it is!

1147
01:20:32,800 --> 01:20:34,441
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, Golden Sun, fuck you.

1148
01:20:34,861 --> 01:20:35,501
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you for watching!

1149
01:20:50,507 --> 01:20:53,070
[SPEAKER_13]: Classic Game of the Week Classic Game of the Week

1150
01:21:12,918 --> 01:21:19,283
[SPEAKER_13]: So DarkSakura, amongst all these newfangled games we're talking about, the three, what's an old classic that folks should be revisiting?

1151
01:21:19,684 --> 01:21:21,125
[SPEAKER_05]: I went for old and obscure.

1152
01:21:22,686 --> 01:21:28,171
[SPEAKER_05]: It's actually a game I've mentioned on the show before, which is to date one of my favorite shoot-em-up games.

1153
01:21:29,492 --> 01:21:38,580
[SPEAKER_05]: It's called Ginga Fukei Densetsu Sapphire, which is one of the last games that came out on the PC Engine, on the Duo.

1154
01:21:39,181 --> 01:21:40,422
[SPEAKER_13]: Oops, I cut it off accidentally.

1155
01:21:40,462 --> 01:21:40,683
[SPEAKER_13]: Sorry.

1156
01:21:40,703 --> 01:21:41,183
[SPEAKER_13]: Here we go again.

1157
01:21:41,203 --> 01:21:42,465
[SPEAKER_13]: Here's a little clip of the game.

1158
01:21:44,106 --> 01:21:46,329
[SPEAKER_05]: I love the music in it.

1159
01:21:46,369 --> 01:21:52,576
[SPEAKER_05]: But it is one of the arcade CD-ROM games that came out.

1160
01:21:52,996 --> 01:22:00,744
[SPEAKER_05]: So that means, of course, with my Turbo Duo, I can't play it, which I do own a copy of the game.

1161
01:22:01,645 --> 01:22:12,968
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's also one of the few games towards the end of the PC Engine's life that had an actual real 3D in it in the form of the bosses and some of the enemies in the game.

1162
01:22:13,648 --> 01:22:21,970
[SPEAKER_05]: But it actually came out recently on PSP as part of the Galaxy Fraulein Collection, which is actually something I plan on ordering very soon.

1163
01:22:22,450 --> 01:22:24,131
[SPEAKER_05]: Because, again, this is one of my favorite games.

1164
01:22:24,791 --> 01:22:28,394
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you want to find it on eBay, good luck.

1165
01:22:29,794 --> 01:22:33,817
[SPEAKER_05]: This game will actually end up costing more than Dracula X does.

1166
01:22:33,857 --> 01:22:36,539
[SPEAKER_05]: This one will go for easily 400 bucks.

1167
01:22:37,139 --> 01:22:37,580
[SPEAKER_05]: I've seen it.

1168
01:22:39,321 --> 01:22:42,283
[SPEAKER_05]: But anyway, it's basically just a standard, you know, shoot-em-up.

1169
01:22:42,563 --> 01:22:48,907
[SPEAKER_05]: You can upgrade your weapons, and you have your little option things hanging out with you, and you just basically go through the game and shoot stuff.

1170
01:22:49,830 --> 01:22:55,694
[SPEAKER_13]: Now, I typed the name of the game in chat, but they would like to hear it pronounced once again, because it is not an easy name, because it is a Japanese game.

1171
01:22:56,495 --> 01:23:00,678
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, it's Ginga Fuke Densetsu Sapphire.

1172
01:23:00,698 --> 01:23:03,040
[SPEAKER_06]: There you go.

1173
01:23:03,750 --> 01:23:08,232
[SPEAKER_05]: If you want a translation of the name, that is Galaxy Policewoman Legend Sapphire.

1174
01:23:09,533 --> 01:23:09,953
[SPEAKER_05]: It came out in 1995.

1175
01:23:10,053 --> 01:23:12,134
[SPEAKER_05]: It is a Hudson Soft game.

1176
01:23:12,895 --> 01:23:15,136
[SPEAKER_05]: One of the... Oh god, I love Hudson.

1177
01:23:15,856 --> 01:23:27,282
[SPEAKER_05]: But also, one of the things about the game, and this is actually something that I've seen in several reviews, and I'm going to repeat this one from one little review, that says...

1178
01:23:28,702 --> 01:23:34,047
[SPEAKER_05]: Really, the game is more of overcoming the game's mechanics rather than mastering them.

1179
01:23:34,708 --> 01:23:39,793
[SPEAKER_05]: So, really, a lot of playing in the game is hit or miss, whether or not you make it through.

1180
01:23:40,013 --> 01:23:43,997
[SPEAKER_05]: If the game has it out for you, it's going to have it out for you.

1181
01:23:44,457 --> 01:23:45,578
[SPEAKER_05]: Where you have actual real 3D...

1182
01:23:46,979 --> 01:23:48,139
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, that's kind of neat.

1183
01:23:48,419 --> 01:23:54,081
[SPEAKER_13]: Like, this boss looks like, imagine one of those giant chemistry molecules they have hanging in chemistry class.

1184
01:23:54,401 --> 01:23:57,702
[SPEAKER_13]: Like, it's like one of those things, but it's actually like rotating around and spinning around.

1185
01:23:57,762 --> 01:24:00,882
[SPEAKER_13]: So, for, you know, a game from 95, that's a pretty cool depth.

1186
01:24:01,242 --> 01:24:01,543
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1187
01:24:02,023 --> 01:24:14,746
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was, it really is, though, even though it's really a little bit on the hard side, your bosses are so easy in this one because they are so predictable in their patterns.

1188
01:24:15,626 --> 01:24:15,766
[SPEAKER_05]: And

1189
01:24:18,118 --> 01:24:25,281
[SPEAKER_05]: The whole part, though, is trying to get around how slow your ship really is.

1190
01:24:26,142 --> 01:24:29,503
[SPEAKER_05]: Because the ship, as you'll see, the ship does move really slowly.

1191
01:24:30,124 --> 01:24:32,725
[SPEAKER_05]: And you have a relatively large hitbox.

1192
01:24:35,086 --> 01:24:37,767
[SPEAKER_05]: The area that will count as you being hit.

1193
01:24:40,751 --> 01:24:42,753
[SPEAKER_13]: This game really doesn't look easy.

1194
01:24:43,133 --> 01:24:43,914
[SPEAKER_13]: It does look very hard.

1195
01:24:44,715 --> 01:24:46,417
[SPEAKER_13]: Have you actually had a chance to play this, DarkSakura?

1196
01:24:46,517 --> 01:24:54,747
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, my friend, actually she lives in Japan right now, she has an original of this, which is how I got my copy of it.

1197
01:24:55,768 --> 01:24:56,269
[SPEAKER_05]: But, um...

1198
01:24:57,450 --> 01:25:07,616
[SPEAKER_05]: She, um, she's got a PC Engine Duo and arcade card, so we went over to her house and she said, okay, play this game, okay, play this game, okay, play this game.

1199
01:25:08,376 --> 01:25:11,138
[SPEAKER_05]: And Sapphire was just like, oh my god!

1200
01:25:11,638 --> 01:25:20,543
[SPEAKER_05]: It was like, this one and another shooter, Psychic Storm, were the ones that I played the most, but mostly because in Psychic Storm it sounds like they're saying I get pissed off instead of saying Psychic Storm.

1201
01:25:21,043 --> 01:25:21,804
[SPEAKER_05]: But that's another game.

1202
01:25:22,384 --> 01:25:30,449
[SPEAKER_05]: But see, isn't that... Really, you should post the link to this in the chat room because it's something that you really have to see.

1203
01:25:30,890 --> 01:25:34,132
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just a fantastic, fantastic shooter.

1204
01:25:35,813 --> 01:25:40,696
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, I'm going to actually do an eBay search right now and see if I can find out how much it's going for.

1205
01:25:41,356 --> 01:25:41,636
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

1206
01:25:41,977 --> 01:25:45,699
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, let me just go ahead and wrap this up and say there it is again, your classic game of the week.

1207
01:25:45,979 --> 01:25:47,460
[SPEAKER_13]: And, Jamie, you might have to correct me here.

1208
01:25:47,901 --> 01:25:50,142
[SPEAKER_13]: Ginga, Foukei, Densetsu, Sapphire.

1209
01:25:50,262 --> 01:25:50,842
[SPEAKER_04]: Not bad.

1210
01:25:51,243 --> 01:25:51,563
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

1211
01:25:52,878 --> 01:25:54,559
[SPEAKER_13]: There it is, your classic game of the week.

1212
01:25:57,001 --> 01:26:00,044
[SPEAKER_13]: We are going to take a break and come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

1213
01:26:00,104 --> 01:26:05,708
[SPEAKER_13]: When we come back from a quick break, we have not even touched on Sony's press conference and Microsoft's press conference.

1214
01:26:05,728 --> 01:26:07,470
[SPEAKER_13]: And believe me, there's a lot to talk about there.

1215
01:26:07,770 --> 01:26:09,171
[SPEAKER_13]: We're also going to cover some other news.

1216
01:26:09,471 --> 01:26:13,034
[SPEAKER_13]: We still need to get the release dates, the FUs of the week, and the mailbag.

1217
01:26:13,074 --> 01:26:14,816
[SPEAKER_13]: So we have a busy Part B still coming up.

1218
01:26:15,076 --> 01:26:16,037
[SPEAKER_13]: We're going to get to it all.

1219
01:26:16,217 --> 01:26:17,158
[SPEAKER_13]: And your phone calls.

1220
01:26:17,258 --> 01:26:18,739
[SPEAKER_13]: My God, we're going to be here until 11 tonight.

1221
01:26:19,179 --> 01:26:19,500
[SPEAKER_13]: No, we'll...

1222
01:26:20,060 --> 01:26:27,958
[SPEAKER_13]: we'll try and wrap it all up in just a little bit we're going to take a quick break to rest our voices and so forth we will be back in just a little bit with more of Orange Lounge Radio

1223
01:26:34,950 --> 01:26:41,775
[SPEAKER_13]: And welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio on our 326th episode for this June the 7th of 2009.

1224
01:26:42,535 --> 01:26:52,201
[SPEAKER_13]: As a reminder, we do tape live on Sunday nights over at allgames.com right after the Bobby Blackwolf show, which is about 6 o'clock Pacific Standard Time, 9 o'clock Eastern Standard Time.

1225
01:26:52,242 --> 01:26:55,243
[SPEAKER_13]: Unless it's a special night, maybe Bobby will go a little longer.

1226
01:26:55,284 --> 01:26:59,887
[SPEAKER_13]: We'll start more like 6.15 as tonight was because it was Bobby's 200th episode.

1227
01:26:59,987 --> 01:27:01,087
[SPEAKER_13]: Quite an accomplishment.

1228
01:27:01,147 --> 01:27:02,108
[SPEAKER_13]: So congratulations.

1229
01:27:02,128 --> 01:27:02,769
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you for watching!

1230
01:27:24,525 --> 01:27:27,546
[SPEAKER_13]: All right, anyhow, we're going to get back and do some E3 rundown.

1231
01:27:27,586 --> 01:27:29,206
[SPEAKER_13]: Again, unscripted tonight.

1232
01:27:29,586 --> 01:27:36,248
[SPEAKER_13]: Just kind of talking and playing around, talking about some of the various events that have happened at E3.

1233
01:27:36,348 --> 01:27:39,849
[SPEAKER_13]: And I guess we're going to talk about Sony's press conference, if that's all right.

1234
01:27:40,149 --> 01:27:45,311
[SPEAKER_14]: Before we do that, I was going to mention a few more things about Nintendo stuff that I saw.

1235
01:27:45,631 --> 01:27:48,752
[SPEAKER_14]: I got to see Sin and Punishment 2, which looked awesome.

1236
01:27:49,012 --> 01:27:49,252
[SPEAKER_14]: You know...

1237
01:27:49,932 --> 01:27:50,933
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1238
01:28:19,707 --> 01:28:20,788
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't even know what that looked like.

1239
01:28:20,848 --> 01:28:21,528
[SPEAKER_14]: It was kind of weird.

1240
01:28:22,249 --> 01:28:24,510
[SPEAKER_14]: But they had some other stuff that they were announcing.

1241
01:28:25,270 --> 01:28:29,053
[SPEAKER_14]: Fossil Fighters for the DS, which I actually know that's coming out in August.

1242
01:28:29,833 --> 01:28:37,017
[SPEAKER_14]: And a new Professor Layton game and Pokemon Mystery Dungeon Explorers of the Sky.

1243
01:28:38,398 --> 01:28:39,139
[SPEAKER_14]: All sorts of stuff.

1244
01:28:39,419 --> 01:28:41,140
[SPEAKER_14]: So that was kind of neat.

1245
01:28:42,100 --> 01:28:42,381
[SPEAKER_14]: And then...

1246
01:28:44,301 --> 01:28:49,385
[SPEAKER_14]: I think... Oh yeah, Sin and Punishment 2 is supposed to be coming out quarter one of next year.

1247
01:28:49,566 --> 01:28:50,206
[SPEAKER_14]: So that's kind of cool.

1248
01:28:51,868 --> 01:28:52,148
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

1249
01:28:52,328 --> 01:28:53,489
[SPEAKER_13]: Are we okay to move on to Sony now?

1250
01:28:53,669 --> 01:28:54,009
[SPEAKER_13]: Sure.

1251
01:28:54,069 --> 01:28:58,093
[SPEAKER_13]: Let's talk Sony, because Sony definitely had a lot of big news out of their press conference.

1252
01:28:58,673 --> 01:29:01,676
[SPEAKER_13]: And a very interesting story I have about Sony.

1253
01:29:01,896 --> 01:29:04,919
[SPEAKER_13]: Loki, you missed day one of E3, which is when the Sony press conference was going on.

1254
01:29:05,299 --> 01:29:10,383
[SPEAKER_13]: From what I understand, day one of E3 was not originally supposed to start until noon, but it ended up starting at 10 a.m.,

1255
01:29:11,144 --> 01:29:12,305
[SPEAKER_13]: DarkSakura, DarkDeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1256
01:29:41,118 --> 01:30:08,710
[SPEAKER_13]: And I wanted to check that out But obviously there's some big announcements at Sony What's also cool and a lot of people may not know because they were at Sony's press conference God of War 3 as you know was playable at the show floor in Sony's booth But during the press conference all the monitors were turned off So you actually couldn't play God of War 3 until the walkthrough was done But you knew it was going to be there because they had the God of War 3 sign up And they already had a line forming But just nobody could play it until the press conference was actually over

1257
01:30:09,170 --> 01:30:12,413
[SPEAKER_13]: But I did get to see some of Sony's press conference at the booth, which is kind of cool.

1258
01:30:12,913 --> 01:30:14,114
[SPEAKER_13]: And to see some of their big announcements.

1259
01:30:14,154 --> 01:30:16,216
[SPEAKER_13]: Of course, God of War 3 being one of them.

1260
01:30:16,696 --> 01:30:18,537
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm not huge on the God of War series.

1261
01:30:18,577 --> 01:30:20,479
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, I certainly respect what it is.

1262
01:30:20,559 --> 01:30:23,781
[SPEAKER_13]: It's just I don't have time to play everything as none of us do.

1263
01:30:23,842 --> 01:30:26,323
[SPEAKER_13]: And this is just one of the big series I haven't gotten around to.

1264
01:30:26,724 --> 01:30:28,105
[SPEAKER_13]: Loki, I don't know if you're big on these games.

1265
01:30:28,805 --> 01:30:29,205
[SPEAKER_14]: I like them.

1266
01:30:29,225 --> 01:30:29,745
[SPEAKER_14]: They're okay.

1267
01:30:30,026 --> 01:30:35,207
[SPEAKER_14]: It's nothing really innovative for God of War 3 other than, you know, obviously the nicer graphics now with the PlayStation 3.

1268
01:30:36,067 --> 01:30:38,368
[SPEAKER_14]: And it is a little bit more detailed in the gore.

1269
01:30:38,968 --> 01:30:46,871
[SPEAKER_14]: In fact, there is one point where they had slashed open, I believe, a minotaur and just like his organs were spilling out.

1270
01:30:46,951 --> 01:30:48,511
[SPEAKER_14]: And you got to see those organs spill out.

1271
01:30:48,851 --> 01:30:49,572
[SPEAKER_14]: So that was kind of cool.

1272
01:30:49,592 --> 01:30:49,952
[SPEAKER_04]: I like organs.

1273
01:30:53,239 --> 01:30:55,766
[SPEAKER_14]: If you're a fan of God of War, you're going to love this game.

1274
01:30:56,067 --> 01:30:59,797
[SPEAKER_14]: It's just the same type of gameplay that you can normally expect from them.

1275
01:31:00,868 --> 01:31:01,449
[SPEAKER_13]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1276
01:31:24,315 --> 01:31:25,075
[SPEAKER_13]: Which is kind of nice.

1277
01:31:25,396 --> 01:31:25,696
[SPEAKER_13]: We'll see.

1278
01:31:25,756 --> 01:31:26,576
[SPEAKER_13]: For now, they do.

1279
01:31:27,036 --> 01:31:27,377
[SPEAKER_13]: We'll see.

1280
01:31:28,317 --> 01:31:31,279
[SPEAKER_13]: Because you know how usually they dub over the Japanese lips.

1281
01:31:31,519 --> 01:31:37,162
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you remember when X-2 came out, they re-synced the animation to the voices, too?

1282
01:31:37,422 --> 01:31:39,803
[SPEAKER_13]: It would be nice if they did that for XIII, but I'm not counting on it.

1283
01:31:40,044 --> 01:31:44,806
[SPEAKER_05]: And they re-did a lot of the CG to match voice.

1284
01:31:44,966 --> 01:31:50,149
[SPEAKER_05]: And they completely re-did two whole scenes in that game for the American audience.

1285
01:31:51,150 --> 01:31:53,471
[SPEAKER_05]: So it makes sense they do something like that with XIII.

1286
01:31:54,562 --> 01:32:03,405
[SPEAKER_13]: So obviously this game's on its way out, and they did confirm this for a 2010 release, and it was nice to see some of it actually getting, you know, some more of it shown to get to know a little more of the story.

1287
01:32:03,425 --> 01:32:04,645
[SPEAKER_14]: They showed Odin, which is pretty cool.

1288
01:32:04,765 --> 01:32:06,666
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, and some of the summons, which is pretty awesome.

1289
01:32:07,106 --> 01:32:17,429
[SPEAKER_13]: But then a huge bombshell dropped right after that at the show, and what's interesting about it is that then he started talking about how Final Fantasy XIV was exclusive to the PlayStation 3.

1290
01:32:18,069 --> 01:32:22,791
[SPEAKER_13]: Before even showing the trailer, he talked about, I'm here to announce that Final Fantasy XIV is going to be exclusive on the PlayStation 3.

1291
01:32:23,191 --> 01:32:23,872
[SPEAKER_13]: Final Fantasy XIV Online

1292
01:32:40,732 --> 01:32:41,693
[SPEAKER_13]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1293
01:32:57,785 --> 01:32:58,405
[SPEAKER_13]: but different.

1294
01:32:58,725 --> 01:33:07,427
[SPEAKER_13]: Actually, 1UP of all places actually had a pretty in-depth talk on Final Fantasy XIV and some of the things they've talked about, they have learned a lot of their lessons from the prior game.

1295
01:33:07,747 --> 01:33:10,848
[SPEAKER_13]: This game is going to be launched globally, Final Fantasy XIV.

1296
01:33:11,168 --> 01:33:13,649
[SPEAKER_13]: It's going to be on the PlayStation 3 and the PC.

1297
01:33:13,869 --> 01:33:14,689
[SPEAKER_13]: It's going to be on both.

1298
01:33:14,709 --> 01:33:15,889
[SPEAKER_13]: They're also talking about bringing it to the 360.

1299
01:33:15,929 --> 01:33:18,010
[SPEAKER_13]: They're thinking about it.

1300
01:33:18,350 --> 01:33:20,290
[SPEAKER_13]: I suppose, but nothing's for sure yet.

1301
01:33:20,870 --> 01:33:24,731
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll probably be playing it on the PC no matter what.

1302
01:33:24,811 --> 01:33:26,672
[SPEAKER_13]: I can't imagine playing it on a console.

1303
01:33:26,752 --> 01:33:27,052
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know.

1304
01:33:27,712 --> 01:33:29,193
[SPEAKER_14]: I really wish they hadn't announced this.

1305
01:33:29,973 --> 01:33:30,273
[SPEAKER_13]: Why?

1306
01:33:30,313 --> 01:33:33,514
[SPEAKER_13]: Because you're just watching your life get sucked away, right?

1307
01:33:33,534 --> 01:33:34,114
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, no.

1308
01:33:34,735 --> 01:33:38,936
[SPEAKER_13]: I seriously wanted to cry standing in the booth watching that trailer.

1309
01:33:38,956 --> 01:33:45,138
[SPEAKER_13]: And it wasn't because of the trailer itself, but it's because I just saw the next few years of my life wilting away at this game.

1310
01:33:45,158 --> 01:33:46,599
[SPEAKER_13]: Because we all know that's what's going to happen.

1311
01:33:46,879 --> 01:33:47,979
[SPEAKER_05]: No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1312
01:33:48,580 --> 01:33:52,221
[SPEAKER_05]: This will happen to me because I have something far better to look forward to.

1313
01:33:52,768 --> 01:33:53,528
[SPEAKER_13]: Star Trek Online

1314
01:34:19,167 --> 01:34:24,991
[SPEAKER_13]: So, it's like, it sounds like some of the biggest flaws of Final Fantasy XI have the potential of being addressed in this.

1315
01:34:25,331 --> 01:34:29,934
[SPEAKER_13]: This could be huge, but of course, I don't want to set the bar too high, or I might be disappointed.

1316
01:34:30,494 --> 01:34:33,536
[SPEAKER_13]: So, I'm... And of course, the chat room wants to know... Whoa.

1317
01:34:33,576 --> 01:34:37,238
[SPEAKER_13]: Maybe this is good music for that question.

1318
01:34:37,278 --> 01:34:37,378
[SPEAKER_13]: No.

1319
01:34:37,698 --> 01:34:42,101
[SPEAKER_13]: Amazatsuma wants to know in chat, Sky, Final Fantasy XIV or Star Trek?

1320
01:34:44,056 --> 01:34:44,816
[SPEAKER_13]: What a tough question.

1321
01:35:15,245 --> 01:35:16,987
[SPEAKER_13]: and one is about swords and weapons.

1322
01:35:17,007 --> 01:35:20,870
[SPEAKER_13]: But they did have those ships that they were flying around and shooting each other and stuff like that.

1323
01:35:20,890 --> 01:35:22,952
[SPEAKER_13]: So you're going to get sucked into this MMO, Loki.

1324
01:35:22,992 --> 01:35:23,893
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know.

1325
01:35:24,173 --> 01:35:25,094
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't have time.

1326
01:35:25,535 --> 01:35:26,416
[SPEAKER_13]: The wife's not going to let you.

1327
01:35:26,436 --> 01:35:27,537
[SPEAKER_13]: You've got kids to raise now.

1328
01:35:27,877 --> 01:35:28,477
[SPEAKER_14]: Who cares?

1329
01:35:31,040 --> 01:35:31,901
[SPEAKER_13]: You can get a sitter.

1330
01:35:33,784 --> 01:35:34,745
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll let them play too.

1331
01:35:35,266 --> 01:35:38,471
[SPEAKER_13]: SSJ100 Matt in chat says, why can't we have our cake and pie at the same time?

1332
01:35:38,591 --> 01:35:39,172
[SPEAKER_13]: Exactly.

1333
01:35:39,573 --> 01:35:42,097
[SPEAKER_13]: Haven't you ever heard of getting ice cream and cake?

1334
01:35:42,397 --> 01:35:46,324
[SPEAKER_14]: Honestly, what'll probably end up happening is I don't know if I'll actually play this game because I'll probably just want time.

1335
01:35:46,744 --> 01:35:48,347
[SPEAKER_14]: It'll be a time factor.

1336
01:35:49,212 --> 01:35:50,653
[SPEAKER_13]: But I am very excited about this.

1337
01:35:50,973 --> 01:35:55,477
[SPEAKER_13]: And honestly, I would say that this right here was the biggest surprise of the show.

1338
01:35:55,797 --> 01:35:57,018
[SPEAKER_13]: No one saw this coming.

1339
01:35:57,398 --> 01:36:03,243
[SPEAKER_13]: Who could imagine that they would have Final Fantasy XIV coming out the same year as XIII, hypothetically?

1340
01:36:03,563 --> 01:36:04,884
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't think they're actually going to make it.

1341
01:36:05,084 --> 01:36:07,046
[SPEAKER_13]: I bet you anything XIV gets pushed back to 2011.

1342
01:36:07,746 --> 01:36:14,472
[SPEAKER_13]: But just the fact that they kind of had the balls to do it, announce the next Final Fantasy game before one's even done, is kind of interesting.

1343
01:36:15,833 --> 01:36:17,174
[SPEAKER_13]: So, we'll see.

1344
01:36:19,083 --> 01:36:21,325
[SPEAKER_13]: Other big things announced at Sony's press conference.

1345
01:36:21,365 --> 01:36:22,746
[SPEAKER_13]: How about Mod Nation Racers?

1346
01:36:23,106 --> 01:36:24,027
[SPEAKER_13]: That was sweet looking.

1347
01:36:24,047 --> 01:36:25,288
[SPEAKER_13]: That was a neat looking game.

1348
01:36:25,328 --> 01:36:27,029
[SPEAKER_13]: Loki, tell us a little bit about this game.

1349
01:36:27,430 --> 01:36:32,854
[SPEAKER_14]: Mod Nation Racers is going to be the next of that play, create, share type of game.

1350
01:36:33,414 --> 01:36:37,177
[SPEAKER_14]: Basically like LittleBigPlanet, but with a Mario Kart racing game.

1351
01:36:37,618 --> 01:36:43,122
[SPEAKER_14]: So you've got these characters that you create that kind of look like those money characters...

1352
01:36:43,562 --> 01:36:44,062
[SPEAKER_14]: Thanks for watching!

1353
01:37:02,774 --> 01:37:04,956
[SPEAKER_14]: So people are going to be able to make their own levels.

1354
01:37:05,637 --> 01:37:08,299
[SPEAKER_14]: Obviously the Mario Kart rip-off levels are going to be in here as well.

1355
01:37:09,400 --> 01:37:14,244
[SPEAKER_14]: But basically create whatever they want as far as races have goes and then share it with their friends.

1356
01:37:15,846 --> 01:37:17,567
[SPEAKER_14]: It's going to be cool.

1357
01:37:18,608 --> 01:37:23,092
[SPEAKER_13]: I can't wait to see how levels get moderated in this game for being Mario Kart courses.

1358
01:37:23,953 --> 01:37:24,614
[SPEAKER_13]: It'll be interesting.

1359
01:37:26,499 --> 01:37:27,800
[SPEAKER_14]: Space, The Final Frontier,

1360
01:37:48,689 --> 01:37:51,531
[SPEAKER_13]: These are the Voyagers of the Starship OLR Prize.

1361
01:37:51,972 --> 01:37:57,416
[SPEAKER_13]: And D'Artesuya continues, It's ongoing mission to seek out new life and new civilizations and blow shit up.

1362
01:37:59,157 --> 01:38:02,120
[SPEAKER_13]: Ranma finishes, To boldly go where no geek has gone before.

1363
01:38:03,000 --> 01:38:03,501
[SPEAKER_13]: Very nice.

1364
01:38:04,361 --> 01:38:05,062
[SPEAKER_13]: Very nicely done.

1365
01:38:05,102 --> 01:38:07,043
[SPEAKER_05]: I like the blow shit up part best.

1366
01:38:08,244 --> 01:38:08,585
[SPEAKER_13]: Let's see.

1367
01:38:09,125 --> 01:38:10,886
[SPEAKER_13]: Uncharted 2 Among Thieves.

1368
01:38:11,547 --> 01:38:13,949
[SPEAKER_13]: I know there's a lot of folks very excited about this game.

1369
01:38:15,170 --> 01:38:16,791
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm not one of them, but it looked neat.

1370
01:38:17,592 --> 01:38:17,812
[SPEAKER_05]: What?

1371
01:38:19,476 --> 01:38:19,757
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know.

1372
01:38:19,797 --> 01:38:20,197
[SPEAKER_13]: You know what?

1373
01:38:20,317 --> 01:38:25,742
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm sitting here and I'm holding in my hand a multiplayer beta code for Uncharted 2.

1374
01:38:26,863 --> 01:38:31,006
[SPEAKER_13]: And, you know, I don't really want to use it.

1375
01:38:31,186 --> 01:38:32,747
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't think Loki wants to use it either.

1376
01:38:32,828 --> 01:38:34,709
[SPEAKER_13]: DarkSakura probably not going to really play it.

1377
01:38:35,109 --> 01:38:39,293
[SPEAKER_13]: So I'm thinking we should give this Uncharted 2 Among Thieves code to a listener.

1378
01:38:39,313 --> 01:38:39,753
[SPEAKER_13]: What do you think?

1379
01:38:39,933 --> 01:38:40,434
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's do it.

1380
01:38:40,754 --> 01:38:47,458
[SPEAKER_13]: All right, here's the thing though, is that this listener has to be willing to write something for the website on this.

1381
01:38:47,638 --> 01:38:52,401
[SPEAKER_13]: So if we give away this beta code, we want them to write something for the website with their impressions.

1382
01:38:52,962 --> 01:38:53,702
[SPEAKER_13]: So that's the deal.

1383
01:38:53,782 --> 01:38:55,723
[SPEAKER_13]: We give you the code, you give us an article.

1384
01:38:56,144 --> 01:38:57,785
[SPEAKER_13]: So how do we give it away?

1385
01:38:57,865 --> 01:38:58,665
[SPEAKER_13]: Do we give it away to live?

1386
01:38:58,745 --> 01:39:00,786
[SPEAKER_13]: We should let the podcasters have a chance at it too, right?

1387
01:39:00,826 --> 01:39:02,888
[SPEAKER_13]: Or maybe open it up on Twitter or something?

1388
01:39:02,908 --> 01:39:04,689
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it should be a match game prize.

1389
01:39:04,949 --> 01:39:06,492
[SPEAKER_13]: Maybe a match game prize later on?

1390
01:39:06,793 --> 01:39:08,536
[SPEAKER_14]: No, I think some of you are a little bit more fair.

1391
01:39:08,556 --> 01:39:10,580
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, a match game is only two people.

1392
01:39:11,061 --> 01:39:11,642
[SPEAKER_13]: So let's see.

1393
01:39:12,042 --> 01:39:14,287
[SPEAKER_13]: Maybe... Let's see.

1394
01:39:14,387 --> 01:39:15,329
[SPEAKER_13]: Send us an email.

1395
01:39:17,108 --> 01:39:18,189
[SPEAKER_13]: No, I got it.

1396
01:39:19,010 --> 01:39:22,834
[SPEAKER_13]: Send us a tweet because you're restricted to 140 characters.

1397
01:39:23,354 --> 01:39:27,118
[SPEAKER_13]: Send us a tweet as to why you should get this code.

1398
01:39:27,959 --> 01:39:31,182
[SPEAKER_13]: And then we'll pick the ones we like and pick one at random.

1399
01:39:31,243 --> 01:39:33,885
[SPEAKER_13]: We don't want to pick our favorite because that's a little too objective.

1400
01:39:34,206 --> 01:39:36,468
[SPEAKER_13]: We'll take all the ones we like and pull one out at random.

1401
01:39:36,748 --> 01:39:39,471
[SPEAKER_13]: So if you send us a tweet about... It better be awesome.

1402
01:39:39,611 --> 01:39:40,691
[SPEAKER_13]: and not direct message.

1403
01:39:40,791 --> 01:39:41,671
[SPEAKER_13]: Do not do a direct message.

1404
01:39:41,691 --> 01:39:44,712
[SPEAKER_13]: You got to do at OLR and then whatever the message is.

1405
01:39:45,052 --> 01:39:47,973
[SPEAKER_13]: So maybe by next show we'll figure out.

1406
01:39:48,553 --> 01:39:49,233
[SPEAKER_13]: Is that too late?

1407
01:39:49,793 --> 01:39:51,913
[SPEAKER_13]: Valid June 3rd through June 28th.

1408
01:39:52,433 --> 01:39:54,454
[SPEAKER_13]: We probably need to give this away sooner rather than later.

1409
01:39:54,854 --> 01:39:55,494
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1410
01:39:55,594 --> 01:39:57,354
[SPEAKER_05]: How about tomorrow?

1411
01:39:58,015 --> 01:39:58,435
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1412
01:39:58,455 --> 01:40:00,235
[SPEAKER_05]: We post the reply on Twitter tomorrow.

1413
01:40:00,255 --> 01:40:03,836
[SPEAKER_13]: The podcast won't be up tomorrow but maybe I'll post something on the Twitter about the contest tomorrow.

1414
01:40:03,856 --> 01:40:04,176
[SPEAKER_04]: By Friday.

1415
01:40:05,296 --> 01:40:05,576
[SPEAKER_04]: Thursday.

1416
01:40:06,900 --> 01:40:08,100
[SPEAKER_13]: Maybe let's say midweek, Wednesday.

1417
01:40:08,280 --> 01:40:09,901
[SPEAKER_13]: Because Wednesday is when the show should go up.

1418
01:40:09,961 --> 01:40:17,903
[SPEAKER_13]: So we're going to say by Wednesday, if you send us a tweet about why you should get this Uncharted 2 beta code, we're going to take our favorites and randomly pick one and give it to you.

1419
01:40:17,943 --> 01:40:19,803
[SPEAKER_13]: And then you're going to write something for our website.

1420
01:40:20,864 --> 01:40:21,304
[SPEAKER_13]: There you go.

1421
01:40:22,544 --> 01:40:23,625
[SPEAKER_13]: A 140-character essay.

1422
01:40:23,685 --> 01:40:24,225
[SPEAKER_13]: I like that.

1423
01:40:24,305 --> 01:40:28,126
[SPEAKER_13]: So to our favorite tweet at why you should have the Uncharted 2 code.

1424
01:40:28,146 --> 01:40:30,306
[SPEAKER_13]: And we'll post a reminder on Twitter a little later on.

1425
01:40:30,866 --> 01:40:31,267
[SPEAKER_13]: Exciting.

1426
01:40:31,887 --> 01:40:32,147
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

1427
01:40:33,746 --> 01:40:34,227
[SPEAKER_13]: Grand Turismo PSP

1428
01:40:53,482 --> 01:41:20,659
[SPEAKER_14]: for a PSP game it actually looked pretty good running at 60 frames per second looks very smooth about fucking time that it came out though seeing as it was supposed to be a launch title so they sure take their times on those Gran Turismo games Metal Gear Solid on the PSP as I predicted a game based off the Metal Gear Solid 3 universe there where you're playing as Big Boss what's kind of interesting though is they're going to have like

1429
01:41:21,303 --> 01:41:31,688
[SPEAKER_14]: Online co-op or like ad hoc co-op or something like that where you can actually play as each person is like a big boss character which kind of is funny look like clones.

1430
01:41:34,149 --> 01:41:35,170
[SPEAKER_13]: How about Assassin's Creed 2?

1431
01:41:37,171 --> 01:41:40,732
[SPEAKER_14]: You know it's a neat trailer but I just don't really care about that game unfortunately.

1432
01:41:40,852 --> 01:41:42,273
[SPEAKER_14]: I played the first one didn't like it.

1433
01:41:42,413 --> 01:41:44,914
[SPEAKER_13]: Kind of file it in the hole don't have time to play everything?

1434
01:41:45,074 --> 01:41:50,497
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah it's sort of yeah it's a neat game they are doing a little bit more with it I think as far as

1435
01:41:51,124 --> 01:41:55,269
[SPEAKER_14]: The Depth of the Game, but, I mean, if you like the first one, you're obviously gonna like this.

1436
01:41:56,591 --> 01:42:02,153
[SPEAKER_13]: Uh, obviously we've been talking a lot about the PSP, but how can we not mention something about the PSP Go?

1437
01:42:02,173 --> 01:42:04,353
[SPEAKER_13]: $249 for the PSP Go.

1438
01:42:04,773 --> 01:42:07,094
[SPEAKER_13]: Are people gonna pay it, or did they shoot themselves in the foot?

1439
01:42:07,114 --> 01:42:15,656
[SPEAKER_14]: That's a tough sell for a system that doesn't have a UMD drive on it, and I don't give a crap if it has 16 megs, or 16 gigabytes of storage.

1440
01:42:15,937 --> 01:42:20,918
[SPEAKER_14]: You know what, I can buy a 16 gigabyte card for cheaper than the difference, so, um...

1441
01:42:23,308 --> 01:42:29,812
[SPEAKER_14]: and there's a lot of stuff that we don't know that's like kind of as far as specs goes.

1442
01:42:30,653 --> 01:42:31,773
[SPEAKER_14]: Is the processor better?

1443
01:42:33,114 --> 01:42:33,694
[SPEAKER_14]: We don't know.

1444
01:42:33,995 --> 01:42:34,975
[SPEAKER_14]: Is it the same?

1445
01:42:35,115 --> 01:42:36,796
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, has it got more RAM in it?

1446
01:42:37,497 --> 01:42:39,558
[SPEAKER_14]: What exactly separates this?

1447
01:42:39,658 --> 01:42:46,862
[SPEAKER_14]: Obviously now it can't really utilize some of the peripherals I think because of where they've placed different things on it.

1448
01:42:49,624 --> 01:42:51,845
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a neat idea I guess but

1449
01:42:53,995 --> 01:42:54,900
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1450
01:42:57,648 --> 01:42:59,629
[SPEAKER_14]: They're not really doing anything with this.

1451
01:42:59,829 --> 01:43:05,992
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, here's what's interesting is that also one of the big things I said, am I going to be able to play my old UMDs on it?

1452
01:43:06,092 --> 01:43:07,933
[SPEAKER_13]: And the answer is possibly.

1453
01:43:08,133 --> 01:43:14,897
[SPEAKER_13]: We haven't heard the final answer yet, but apparently Sony isn't developing right now a Goodwill program is what they're calling it.

1454
01:43:15,417 --> 01:43:22,481
[SPEAKER_13]: And basically they're saying it might be similar to portable copy, which is how you transfer your Blu-ray movies from the PS3 down to the PSP.

1455
01:43:23,821 --> 01:43:26,563
[SPEAKER_13]: Users would not be ripping their UMDs,

1456
01:43:26,983 --> 01:43:29,987
[SPEAKER_13]: But there'll be some type of digital distribution method on how it's done.

1457
01:43:30,007 --> 01:43:35,675
[SPEAKER_14]: So it's going to be a code in a manual that you're going to basically be able to download it to your system or something like that.

1458
01:43:36,096 --> 01:43:36,517
[SPEAKER_14]: Awesome!

1459
01:43:36,597 --> 01:43:42,325
[SPEAKER_14]: So what's going to happen is someone's going to basically buy the game, dump the code in, return the game.

1460
01:43:42,465 --> 01:43:42,886
[SPEAKER_14]: The end.

1461
01:43:43,627 --> 01:44:08,557
[SPEAKER_14]: or you're going to have it where it's your well that might work for new games but what about the games that you have right now see that's the problem is how they're going to be able to do that and if it's a kiosk solution where you basically take it to a kiosk and it dumps it to your system that's a whole nother problem right there it just there's no real way I see this working you know other than you know having it be a code in the manual and even then

1462
01:44:09,338 --> 01:44:10,119
[SPEAKER_14]: Sony's Motion Controller

1463
01:44:30,612 --> 01:44:31,812
[SPEAKER_13]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1464
01:44:54,821 --> 01:44:57,062
[SPEAKER_13]: Really, it is kind of that patent we saw earlier.

1465
01:44:57,102 --> 01:45:06,568
[SPEAKER_13]: Remember how you talked about how there was this EyeToy patent and that it was going to be red dots and blue dots that the EyeToy could see that would differentiate it and we thought it was something that would go on the regular controller?

1466
01:45:06,608 --> 01:45:10,131
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, it's like this new little motion thing that has the things on it.

1467
01:45:10,291 --> 01:45:10,791
[SPEAKER_14]: It looked dumb.

1468
01:45:11,591 --> 01:45:13,673
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, I'm sorry, but the controller looks retarded.

1469
01:45:14,093 --> 01:45:23,819
[SPEAKER_14]: And, you know, the only cool thing that they did with it was the augment of reality stuff where, like, you see yourself and then when you're moving the thing around, it replaces it.

1470
01:45:24,372 --> 01:45:25,053
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1471
01:45:54,692 --> 01:46:00,735
[SPEAKER_13]: It's just, it... The thing I worry about with these motion controls is how well are they really going to work?

1472
01:46:01,236 --> 01:46:02,897
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, we kind of went through this with the Wii.

1473
01:46:03,297 --> 01:46:07,179
[SPEAKER_13]: When the Wii was announced, I think a lot of us, our jaws hit the floor and so forth.

1474
01:46:07,359 --> 01:46:09,620
[SPEAKER_13]: And now when we kind of want, you know, sometimes it doesn't work.

1475
01:46:09,860 --> 01:46:13,442
[SPEAKER_13]: Now they're telling us they've got to have Motion Plus because it doesn't work as well as they originally intended.

1476
01:46:13,622 --> 01:46:18,625
[SPEAKER_14]: Here's what I want to, the main focus I would like to see with this is what are the limitations?

1477
01:46:19,721 --> 01:46:22,362
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1478
01:46:41,499 --> 01:46:42,360
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1479
01:47:02,444 --> 01:47:02,665
[SPEAKER_14]: and so on.

1480
01:47:18,945 --> 01:47:19,605
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1481
01:47:37,864 --> 01:47:39,385
[SPEAKER_14]: The PlayStation Eye Sensors

1482
01:48:03,158 --> 01:48:05,843
[SPEAKER_14]: And, you know, the camera's really kind of useless anyways right now.

1483
01:48:06,124 --> 01:48:13,257
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, I know because I own cameras for both, you know, the Vision camera and the PlayStation Eye and...

1484
01:48:14,781 --> 01:48:16,581
[SPEAKER_14]: Honestly, haven't used either one of them, really.

1485
01:48:16,881 --> 01:48:19,362
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, other than trying out Totem Ball, which sucked.

1486
01:48:19,962 --> 01:48:22,283
[SPEAKER_14]: But, it's just they're kind of useless.

1487
01:48:22,683 --> 01:48:26,644
[SPEAKER_14]: And, I mean, Sony is doing a little bit more with the PlayStation Eye camera.

1488
01:48:26,664 --> 01:48:29,084
[SPEAKER_14]: Like, they have the Eye Pet thing coming out.

1489
01:48:29,164 --> 01:48:33,165
[SPEAKER_14]: They've got, you know, some cool implementations for, like, you know, photos and stuff like that.

1490
01:48:33,185 --> 01:48:34,225
[SPEAKER_14]: And a little Big Planet.

1491
01:48:34,825 --> 01:48:39,186
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, then the normal face mapping stuff for, like, the EA Sports games and stuff like that.

1492
01:48:39,766 --> 01:48:42,067
[SPEAKER_14]: But, I just don't...

1493
01:48:43,402 --> 01:48:43,682
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know.

1494
01:48:43,702 --> 01:48:46,503
[SPEAKER_14]: They're going to have to make this controller a lot better looking than it looks.

1495
01:48:46,543 --> 01:48:47,524
[SPEAKER_14]: And I know it's a prototype.

1496
01:48:48,024 --> 01:48:53,846
[SPEAKER_13]: And I want to read this comment from chat because here, Legend of Zaku in chat says, Jesus Christ, this goddamn prototype.

1497
01:48:53,886 --> 01:49:01,129
[SPEAKER_13]: Remember that the PS3 controller is still in development, so everything you saw last week is a prototype tech demo, so the final versions will vary once it's released.

1498
01:49:01,510 --> 01:49:04,111
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, yeah, but at the same time, this is...

1499
01:49:05,111 --> 01:49:08,975
[SPEAKER_13]: Sony is in front of the world showing it what is going to be playing in the next year.

1500
01:49:09,295 --> 01:49:13,640
[SPEAKER_13]: So while there might be slight variations, I mean, this is what they are planning right now.

1501
01:49:13,960 --> 01:49:18,024
[SPEAKER_13]: And unless something freaking major happens, this is going to be what it is next year.

1502
01:49:18,345 --> 01:49:22,929
[SPEAKER_14]: See, this to me looks almost like a copy of a Wii Remote.

1503
01:49:23,490 --> 01:49:28,235
[SPEAKER_14]: Basically, it's kind of what... They're all, how can we mimic what the Wii Remote does...

1504
01:49:29,605 --> 01:49:36,027
[SPEAKER_14]: But, you know, make it a little bit better and, you know, not use the same technology so we don't get sued.

1505
01:49:36,668 --> 01:49:43,670
[SPEAKER_14]: That's what this seems like, whereas the Microsoft one was like, how can we do something that's motion control, but different and better?

1506
01:49:44,390 --> 01:49:48,772
[SPEAKER_13]: And some folks in chat are invoking the PlayStation 3 boomerang, like GSX-H has changed his nickname.

1507
01:49:48,792 --> 01:49:51,393
[SPEAKER_13]: Like, remember when the PlayStation 3 controller was supposed to look like that boomerang?

1508
01:49:51,413 --> 01:49:51,493
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

1509
01:49:51,513 --> 01:49:53,014
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, and thank God they didn't do that.

1510
01:49:53,034 --> 01:49:55,075
[SPEAKER_13]: Because of all the negative reaction, they didn't end up doing that.

1511
01:49:55,155 --> 01:50:00,298
[SPEAKER_13]: So, you know, Sony has been known to go back to the drawing board when they get negative reception.

1512
01:50:00,358 --> 01:50:02,058
[SPEAKER_13]: So could something like that happen here?

1513
01:50:02,198 --> 01:50:13,564
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, and I just, I think the whole setup is going to be really, it's going to suck because, you know, once again, going back to the Microsoft one, you're not trying to sound like a fanboy here, but all you need is a camera.

1514
01:50:14,165 --> 01:50:14,405
[SPEAKER_14]: Done.

1515
01:50:14,885 --> 01:50:18,687
[SPEAKER_14]: You got the camera, you can play four players, 16 players, whatever the game's going to support.

1516
01:50:19,087 --> 01:50:20,408
[SPEAKER_14]: Because you are the controller.

1517
01:50:21,670 --> 01:50:22,191
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1518
01:50:43,911 --> 01:50:46,153
[SPEAKER_13]: White Knight Chronicles White Knight Chronicles

1519
01:51:05,871 --> 01:51:07,614
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a very pretty looking game.

1520
01:51:07,894 --> 01:51:10,999
[SPEAKER_13]: I had it described as Final Fantasy XII meets Xenogears.

1521
01:51:12,502 --> 01:51:14,845
[SPEAKER_13]: It was a very pretty looking game.

1522
01:51:15,506 --> 01:51:16,568
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm definitely interested in it.

1523
01:51:16,989 --> 01:51:17,590
[SPEAKER_04]: That sounds cool.

1524
01:51:18,004 --> 01:51:18,945
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

1525
01:51:19,005 --> 01:51:20,085
[SPEAKER_13]: Loki, you actually played it.

1526
01:51:20,125 --> 01:51:21,406
[SPEAKER_13]: I had to watch you play that one.

1527
01:51:21,426 --> 01:51:22,606
[SPEAKER_13]: What did you think of White Knight Chronicles?

1528
01:51:22,626 --> 01:51:23,787
[SPEAKER_14]: How did it control?

1529
01:51:24,047 --> 01:51:24,908
[SPEAKER_14]: It controlled fine.

1530
01:51:25,028 --> 01:51:31,711
[SPEAKER_14]: It was just basically target something and then you had macros and pick which macro you want to, you know, which attack you want to do.

1531
01:51:31,731 --> 01:51:35,093
[SPEAKER_14]: And then you can also set up a macro for a combo of attacks and stuff like that.

1532
01:51:36,834 --> 01:51:37,154
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know.

1533
01:51:37,314 --> 01:51:38,495
[SPEAKER_14]: It seemed easy, but...

1534
01:51:39,909 --> 01:51:42,252
[SPEAKER_13]: It was neat.

1535
01:51:42,332 --> 01:51:49,222
[SPEAKER_13]: SSJ100Matt, going back to the motion control in chat room, chat.orange.com says, I think the fact that he gave a release date is what's bothering me.

1536
01:51:49,282 --> 01:51:50,704
[SPEAKER_13]: Spring 2010 is too soon for that to be out.

1537
01:51:50,724 --> 01:51:52,426
[SPEAKER_13]: They never stick to the release dates, ever.

1538
01:51:52,747 --> 01:51:54,529
[SPEAKER_13]: Home got delayed how long?

1539
01:51:55,350 --> 01:51:57,992
[SPEAKER_14]: I need to go grab some more water, so talk more about Sony with us, our listeners, Loki

1540
01:52:15,501 --> 01:52:17,342
[SPEAKER_14]: including the PSP of course.

1541
01:52:18,043 --> 01:52:21,425
[SPEAKER_14]: Other things, Resident Evil Portable was announced, which is pretty sweet.

1542
01:52:22,025 --> 01:52:25,687
[SPEAKER_14]: We talked a little bit about Metal Gear Solid, Peace Walker, the PSP version there.

1543
01:52:26,648 --> 01:52:27,448
[SPEAKER_14]: That was pretty cool.

1544
01:52:28,929 --> 01:52:37,854
[SPEAKER_14]: Coming to both the 360 and PS3, and I think we may get into this a little bit more, but they have the new Metal Gear Solid Rising, or the Raiden one.

1545
01:52:38,534 --> 01:52:43,037
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's actually, I wanted to find out if they did anything on that, because I actually like Raiden.

1546
01:52:43,928 --> 01:52:44,950
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, that looked kind of cool.

1547
01:52:45,190 --> 01:52:51,919
[SPEAKER_14]: And then, um... You know, they announced more stuff coming to, uh... Home.

1548
01:52:52,760 --> 01:52:55,164
[SPEAKER_14]: But I kind of zoned out when that happened.

1549
01:52:55,604 --> 01:52:57,667
[SPEAKER_14]: Uh, the biggest announcement, I think, well...

1550
01:52:58,660 --> 01:53:26,570
[SPEAKER_14]: they didn't really show anything so it can't be that big of an announcement for me but Rockstar announced a new game franchise that's going to be exclusive to the PS3 called Agent that was going to be about secret agents and stuff like that the problem I have with this though is they also announced that franchise Noir is going to be a Playstation exclusive at one time and we still haven't even seen that yet so let's finish one franchise first before we start announcing another one that's my thing though

1551
01:53:27,822 --> 01:53:55,757
[SPEAKER_14]: and then I did actually get to play the Motorstorm Arctic I forget the subtitle on it but the new Arctic themed Motorstorm game on the PSP that was pretty fun like a normal Motorstorm game actually looked pretty good on the PSP I watched other than White Knight Chronicles I watched some of the God of War stuff looks just like normal God of War games

1552
01:53:56,809 --> 01:54:04,636
[SPEAKER_14]: They didn't really have... I was hoping to play that... What other PSP games do they have?

1553
01:54:06,077 --> 01:54:11,262
[SPEAKER_14]: They have the add-on for Wipeout, HD, Licked OK.

1554
01:54:11,282 --> 01:54:13,323
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

1555
01:54:15,615 --> 01:54:20,956
[SPEAKER_14]: But I kind of got a brief overview of everything that they had at Sony's booth, and they've got some pretty good stuff coming.

1556
01:54:21,316 --> 01:54:23,236
[SPEAKER_14]: I didn't really see anything, though, on Gran Turismo 5.

1557
01:54:23,796 --> 01:54:26,217
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, they did announce Gran Turismo 5 is coming.

1558
01:54:26,577 --> 01:54:28,257
[SPEAKER_14]: It's going to have 400 cars.

1559
01:54:28,877 --> 01:54:43,720
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, great that it has 400 cars, but you know, the same time, Forza 3, they announced the launch date for it, and it's this fall, so you

1560
01:54:44,468 --> 01:54:47,269
[SPEAKER_14]: Better hurry, because that looks pretty good too.

1561
01:54:47,349 --> 01:54:51,911
[SPEAKER_14]: And honestly, 400 cars sounds good, but do we really need 400 cars?

1562
01:54:52,411 --> 01:54:53,351
[SPEAKER_14]: I wouldn't know which one to pick.

1563
01:54:53,651 --> 01:54:54,392
[SPEAKER_13]: I wouldn't know either.

1564
01:54:55,372 --> 01:54:59,954
[SPEAKER_13]: All right, we need to do some of our regular segments here before we get to Microsoft's press conference.

1565
01:55:00,814 --> 01:55:03,055
[SPEAKER_13]: It wouldn't be a week if we didn't say something angsty.

1566
01:55:03,855 --> 01:55:05,316
[SPEAKER_13]: So let's do our FUs of the week.

1567
01:55:05,416 --> 01:55:06,396
[SPEAKER_13]: Folks, how's that sound?

1568
01:55:06,536 --> 01:55:07,056
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's shout.

1569
01:55:07,096 --> 01:55:11,299
[SPEAKER_13]: Even though we haven't had anything angsty to bring this on, but I don't know.

1570
01:55:11,759 --> 01:55:12,219
[SPEAKER_13]: You know what?

1571
01:55:12,340 --> 01:55:16,522
[SPEAKER_13]: I could say something angsty to invoke this would be how much stuff we didn't get to see at E3.

1572
01:55:16,862 --> 01:55:19,884
[SPEAKER_13]: There were way too many booths with way too much stuff behind closed doors.

1573
01:55:19,944 --> 01:55:20,665
[SPEAKER_13]: What are you so afraid of?

1574
01:55:23,006 --> 01:55:24,507
[SPEAKER_13]: So anyway, bring on the angst.

1575
01:55:39,813 --> 01:55:41,655
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, F you to not being able to go to E3.

1576
01:55:43,117 --> 01:55:45,779
[SPEAKER_05]: So, that's blanket.

1577
01:55:45,879 --> 01:55:46,920
[SPEAKER_05]: And for being somewhat sick.

1578
01:55:47,001 --> 01:55:47,181
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

1579
01:55:50,312 --> 01:55:56,734
[SPEAKER_14]: F you to the Australian family that was eating next to us on Friday night.

1580
01:55:58,155 --> 01:56:00,335
[SPEAKER_14]: I forget the restaurant, but they were famous for ribs.

1581
01:56:01,115 --> 01:56:10,738
[SPEAKER_14]: Anyways, apparently they like to yell a lot and talk about how their aunt and uncle have sex right in front of their kids.

1582
01:56:11,298 --> 01:56:17,360
[SPEAKER_14]: So F you to them because they were loud and obnoxious and we were making fun of them all weekend long.

1583
01:56:19,002 --> 01:56:23,605
[SPEAKER_14]: So, yeah, they suck.

1584
01:56:24,586 --> 01:56:25,867
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't really have a lot of FUs.

1585
01:56:26,007 --> 01:56:28,729
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, I had the week off of work, and that's always something to be excited about.

1586
01:56:28,769 --> 01:56:31,531
[SPEAKER_13]: So, FU to the fact that I have to go back to the old work tomorrow.

1587
01:56:31,591 --> 01:56:32,351
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, I got one more.

1588
01:56:33,032 --> 01:56:41,797
[SPEAKER_14]: FU to my work for not actually finalizing my payment for my hotel that I stayed at in downtown LA.

1589
01:56:42,138 --> 01:56:42,918
[SPEAKER_14]: Sticking me with an $800 bill.

1590
01:56:44,279 --> 01:57:01,467
[SPEAKER_14]: because they didn't, either they screwed up or E3 Housing screwed up and my company, which was supposed to have, you know, faxed an authorization for their credit card, that didn't happen and so I had to pay like $600 more than I was expecting.

1591
01:57:02,208 --> 01:57:03,188
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, screw them.

1592
01:57:03,408 --> 01:57:04,649
[SPEAKER_14]: You should really get reimbursed, right?

1593
01:57:05,129 --> 01:57:06,750
[SPEAKER_14]: I better fucking get reimbursed.

1594
01:57:06,770 --> 01:57:07,190
[SPEAKER_13]: There you go.

1595
01:57:08,211 --> 01:57:08,851
[SPEAKER_13]: Take it to man.

1596
01:57:10,412 --> 01:57:11,012
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

1597
01:57:11,630 --> 01:57:16,255
[SPEAKER_13]: One of our other segments we always have to do here every week on the show is the part where you get to interact with us.

1598
01:57:16,335 --> 01:57:19,638
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's where you send us emails at Mailbag at OrangeLoungeReader.com.

1599
01:57:20,039 --> 01:57:27,466
[SPEAKER_13]: And every week, the lovely Dark Sakura jumps into the mailbag headfirst and lands with a few emails on her forehead.

1600
01:57:27,546 --> 01:57:31,510
[SPEAKER_13]: So she's going to pick out some of her favorites and read them for you right now.

1601
01:57:31,811 --> 01:57:33,292
[SPEAKER_13]: Mailbag at OrangeLoungeReader.com.

1602
01:57:36,175 --> 01:57:37,475
[SPEAKER_05]: The first one comes from Taz.

1603
01:57:37,695 --> 01:57:38,876
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, Loki, you called it.

1604
01:57:39,456 --> 01:57:45,357
[SPEAKER_05]: Seeing how the LEGO games have been in the past year, this one probably is going to turn out to be better than the rest of the Harry Potter games out there.

1605
01:57:46,057 --> 01:57:55,380
[SPEAKER_05]: This is supposedly from years 1 through 4, and I guess we will see years 5 through 7 and then some perhaps when movie 8 comes out in 2011.

1606
01:57:55,980 --> 01:58:00,821
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm wondering if the game will follow the same LEGO Star Wars formula, or would it go all new on us?

1607
01:58:01,721 --> 01:58:10,571
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyways, I know have game for my soon-to-be wife, which I'm probably going to enjoy as well, the game you pervs.

1608
01:58:10,591 --> 01:58:16,518
[SPEAKER_14]: I think he's talking, obviously he's talking about like a Harry Potter that got announced that was coming out, big surprise there.

1609
01:58:17,399 --> 01:58:17,459
[SPEAKER_14]: Um...

1610
01:58:18,424 --> 01:58:20,685
[SPEAKER_14]: The only good thing about that is that means that toys are coming back.

1611
01:58:20,845 --> 01:58:21,865
[SPEAKER_14]: My wife was asking about that.

1612
01:58:21,885 --> 01:58:23,906
[SPEAKER_14]: We actually went to the Lego store that was on Downtown Disney.

1613
01:58:24,086 --> 01:58:24,446
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, nice.

1614
01:58:25,266 --> 01:58:26,446
[SPEAKER_14]: But no Lego Harry Potter.

1615
01:58:27,067 --> 01:58:27,927
[SPEAKER_14]: No weird stuff.

1616
01:58:28,747 --> 01:58:31,468
[SPEAKER_14]: They hopefully will re-release toys when that comes out.

1617
01:58:31,668 --> 01:58:33,789
[SPEAKER_13]: I would not bet they're going to do anything new.

1618
01:58:33,849 --> 01:58:35,669
[SPEAKER_13]: I think they have to stay pretty true to the books.

1619
01:58:35,729 --> 01:58:37,970
[SPEAKER_13]: I think that might be some type of agreement.

1620
01:58:37,990 --> 01:58:42,952
[SPEAKER_14]: I think he was saying as far as new as gameplay-wise compared to the other Lego Indiana Jones stuff.

1621
01:58:43,172 --> 01:58:44,072
[SPEAKER_13]: I wouldn't expect anything.

1622
01:58:44,812 --> 01:58:47,533
[SPEAKER_13]: Maybe the magic element, but that's probably as far as you're going to get.

1623
01:58:49,304 --> 01:58:49,724
[SPEAKER_13]: So that's it.

1624
01:58:50,545 --> 01:58:53,306
[SPEAKER_05]: The next one is from Cheeseburger.

1625
01:58:54,687 --> 01:59:00,291
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey guys, you've been talking about your iTunes ranking and how people leaving negative reviews pushes you back a few pages.

1626
01:59:00,811 --> 01:59:05,073
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I've been thinking that when people subscribe to a podcast, that podcast rank will go up.

1627
01:59:05,434 --> 01:59:09,676
[SPEAKER_05]: So is everyone unsubscribed and then resubscribed to OLR in one week, your rank would skyrocket?

1628
01:59:10,196 --> 01:59:11,957
[SPEAKER_05]: Am I right or is this just a load of crap?

1629
01:59:12,538 --> 01:59:17,661
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess we could just test it out this week, like set a date for the and then resubscription to OLR.

1630
01:59:19,128 --> 01:59:23,231
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, and he wanted you to verify your email address.

1631
01:59:23,331 --> 01:59:29,155
[SPEAKER_13]: There's two ways that iTunes ranks shows, and the one where it has like five pages of featured shows, quote-unquote.

1632
01:59:29,175 --> 01:59:30,216
[SPEAKER_13]: We're not even on it anymore.

1633
01:59:30,316 --> 01:59:33,118
[SPEAKER_13]: Five pages of video game shows, we're not even there anymore.

1634
01:59:33,558 --> 01:59:34,759
[SPEAKER_13]: So I don't know.

1635
01:59:35,179 --> 01:59:37,320
[SPEAKER_13]: Just like I said, word of mouth is all we got, guys.

1636
01:59:37,521 --> 01:59:39,902
[SPEAKER_13]: So I've kind of given up on the whole iTunes thing.

1637
01:59:41,303 --> 01:59:42,584
[SPEAKER_13]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1638
02:00:05,180 --> 02:00:07,222
[SPEAKER_13]: There's an email that I don't think I can read.

1639
02:00:32,489 --> 02:00:33,370
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, skip it, do the next one.

1640
02:00:33,390 --> 02:00:34,410
[SPEAKER_05]: It doesn't have punctuation.

1641
02:00:34,630 --> 02:00:35,391
[SPEAKER_13]: Let's do the next one then.

1642
02:00:36,091 --> 02:00:36,551
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry.

1643
02:00:36,771 --> 02:00:37,572
[SPEAKER_13]: You don't have to read them all.

1644
02:00:38,032 --> 02:00:41,234
[SPEAKER_05]: I know, but I usually like to read them as much as I can.

1645
02:00:41,954 --> 02:00:47,938
[SPEAKER_05]: But someone who really likes Pepsi Throwback, which I've had, me who does not like soda.

1646
02:00:48,098 --> 02:00:48,918
[SPEAKER_13]: I still haven't had it.

1647
02:00:49,439 --> 02:00:49,879
[SPEAKER_05]: It's good.

1648
02:00:50,219 --> 02:00:50,499
[SPEAKER_13]: Is it?

1649
02:00:50,799 --> 02:00:56,783
[SPEAKER_05]: It tastes like old, except it still has that, oh my god, I just sucked a spoonful of sugar aftertaste, which is like honey.

1650
02:00:57,423 --> 02:00:57,743
[SPEAKER_05]: But anyway.

1651
02:00:57,943 --> 02:00:58,564
[SPEAKER_13]: Where can I get it?

1652
02:00:59,620 --> 02:01:00,101
[SPEAKER_13]: Walmart?

1653
02:01:00,481 --> 02:01:00,902
[SPEAKER_13]: Everywhere?

1654
02:01:01,502 --> 02:01:02,764
[SPEAKER_13]: I haven't seen it, I swear.

1655
02:01:02,784 --> 02:01:05,908
[SPEAKER_05]: The gas station down the street from my house?

1656
02:01:06,568 --> 02:01:07,169
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll check that out.

1657
02:01:07,590 --> 02:01:08,931
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

1658
02:01:09,151 --> 02:01:10,753
[SPEAKER_05]: This is the last one and it's a bit long.

1659
02:01:12,395 --> 02:01:15,579
[SPEAKER_05]: And it is from, I think, Spazinator?

1660
02:01:15,599 --> 02:01:15,839
[SPEAKER_05]: Spazinator?

1661
02:01:17,501 --> 02:01:19,904
[SPEAKER_05]: So I will just hop right on in and read it.

1662
02:01:21,105 --> 02:01:22,286
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi everyone!

1663
02:01:23,127 --> 02:01:29,433
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought that I'd write in in order to bring up a few interrelated topics for today's show, being today's, assuming there is a show today.

1664
02:01:29,774 --> 02:01:31,475
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep, there is, you're listening to it, hopefully.

1665
02:01:33,117 --> 02:01:40,545
[SPEAKER_05]: Before I get to the topics at hand, I'd like to apologize in advance if this email runs unusually long, as I am combining two weeks worth of topics into one email.

1666
02:01:42,128 --> 02:01:47,511
[SPEAKER_05]: First off, in regards to what Sky mentioned on the previous week's show, coming back to Final Fantasy XI, I'd like to say congrats.

1667
02:01:48,271 --> 02:01:49,412
[SPEAKER_05]: You had made a fine choice.

1668
02:01:49,992 --> 02:02:00,458
[SPEAKER_05]: If I may, I'd at least like to think that I may have possibly played a small role in influencing you in returning to the game, considering that I'm always talking about LLR.

1669
02:02:00,678 --> 02:02:02,139
[SPEAKER_05]: How's your return to Vanadiel so far?

1670
02:02:02,659 --> 02:02:08,002
[SPEAKER_05]: If you happen to be on either Odin or Alexander and see a Taru-Taru named Derwunch...

1671
02:02:09,946 --> 02:02:11,769
[SPEAKER_05]: Dariwa Hyunjiwa

1672
02:02:26,904 --> 02:02:48,300
[SPEAKER_05]: on a Final Fantasy related note what are your impressions of the announcement trailer from E3 regarding the previous unannounced Final Fantasy I think we've been over this personally I have mixed feelings about it on one hand being a big old Final Fantasy experience fan that I am I'm rather excited about any upcoming Final Fantasy game and new story experience points that each game brings

1673
02:02:50,103 --> 02:02:56,167
[SPEAKER_05]: On the other hand, I'm concerned that Final Fantasy XIV being an MMO will cannibalize Final Fantasy XI's user base.

1674
02:02:56,627 --> 02:03:01,610
[SPEAKER_05]: Hell, for all I know, Final Fantasy XI may, and I stress the word may, shut down as a result.

1675
02:03:02,491 --> 02:03:08,155
[SPEAKER_05]: Even though I do plan to play XIV, I still don't want to leave XI or see any aspect of it suffer as a result.

1676
02:03:08,235 --> 02:03:10,096
[SPEAKER_05]: The game has a damn good storyline and community.

1677
02:03:11,554 --> 02:03:13,915
[SPEAKER_13]: There will always be people out there wanting to play XI.

1678
02:03:13,955 --> 02:03:17,155
[SPEAKER_13]: You just might see some of the server consolidations and those types of things.

1679
02:03:17,875 --> 02:03:20,656
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, inevitably some of the user base is going to go over to XIV.

1680
02:03:20,696 --> 02:03:21,576
[SPEAKER_13]: That's just what happens.

1681
02:03:21,616 --> 02:03:24,437
[SPEAKER_13]: But then again, look at EverQuest and EverQuest 2.

1682
02:03:25,337 --> 02:03:29,718
[SPEAKER_13]: When EverQuest 2 came out, not a lot of people wanted to leave EverQuest 1.

1683
02:03:30,218 --> 02:03:32,279
[SPEAKER_13]: And EverQuest 2 kind of suffered because of that.

1684
02:03:32,739 --> 02:03:33,339
[SPEAKER_13]: However...

1685
02:03:34,139 --> 02:03:36,300
[SPEAKER_13]: I think there's a lot different going on here.

1686
02:03:36,340 --> 02:03:37,940
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, for one, it's Final Fantasy.

1687
02:03:38,000 --> 02:03:49,663
[SPEAKER_13]: For another, you have a lot of people, and I can't stress this enough, you have a lot of people who used to play XI and left because things weren't fixed, but I think they're going to want to give XIV a try.

1688
02:03:50,123 --> 02:03:52,563
[SPEAKER_13]: So, is it possible for both games to coexist?

1689
02:03:52,724 --> 02:03:58,725
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, but I think XI will probably shrink down significantly in size, but I think there'll always be people playing XI somewhere.

1690
02:04:00,356 --> 02:04:01,457
[SPEAKER_13]: Final Fantasy XIV Final Fantasy XIV

1691
02:04:21,751 --> 02:04:24,673
[SPEAKER_05]: As a broader question, what's everyone's impressions of this year's E3?

1692
02:04:26,395 --> 02:04:29,297
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you feel are the high points as well as the low points?

1693
02:04:29,417 --> 02:04:35,422
[SPEAKER_05]: Additionally, do you feel that there was a clear-cut winner between Microsoft, Nintendo, or Sony's conferences?

1694
02:04:35,562 --> 02:04:40,907
[SPEAKER_05]: As a result of E3, would you say there's anything coming out between now and early next year that you're particularly psyched about?

1695
02:04:42,136 --> 02:04:44,818
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, I think this show is going to kind of hit on all those points.

1696
02:04:44,878 --> 02:04:46,419
[SPEAKER_13]: It's kind of what we built the show around tonight.

1697
02:04:46,459 --> 02:04:52,584
[SPEAKER_13]: But I will say I will address the conference question between is there a clear winner between Microsoft, Sony, and Nintendo.

1698
02:04:52,624 --> 02:04:56,247
[SPEAKER_13]: And I'm going to say no, there is no clear winner between the three.

1699
02:04:56,327 --> 02:04:57,508
[SPEAKER_05]: I think the Twitter conference wins.

1700
02:04:59,749 --> 02:05:00,710
[SPEAKER_13]: I guess, I guess.

1701
02:05:00,830 --> 02:05:05,514
[SPEAKER_13]: But there is no winner in my opinion because not enough is out there right now.

1702
02:05:07,102 --> 02:05:09,243
[SPEAKER_14]: I think Microsoft had a really good showing.

1703
02:05:09,684 --> 02:05:23,973
[SPEAKER_14]: The only thing I think holding me back from Sony as far as grading them as high as Microsoft is a lot of their stuff that they announced, and granted Microsoft is capable of this as well, a lot of it is not coming out anytime soon.

1704
02:05:24,474 --> 02:05:36,502
[SPEAKER_14]: Microsoft, they had Crackdown 2 and stuff that they announced, which we'll be getting into more of that stuff, 2010 stuff, but a lot of it they did announce with dates and time frames like this is coming out.

1705
02:05:37,442 --> 02:05:37,982
[SPEAKER_14]: October.

1706
02:05:38,602 --> 02:05:42,944
[SPEAKER_14]: This is coming out then instead of Final Fantasy XIV.

1707
02:05:43,004 --> 02:05:45,004
[SPEAKER_14]: That's not coming out until next year.

1708
02:05:45,044 --> 02:05:47,165
[SPEAKER_13]: This is part of our 10-year strategy.

1709
02:05:47,205 --> 02:05:47,605
[SPEAKER_14]: Exactly.

1710
02:05:47,805 --> 02:05:49,366
[SPEAKER_14]: Or Final Fantasy XIII.

1711
02:05:49,406 --> 02:05:50,826
[SPEAKER_14]: That's not coming out until next year.

1712
02:05:51,646 --> 02:05:53,107
[SPEAKER_14]: Or God of War 3.

1713
02:05:53,187 --> 02:05:54,707
[SPEAKER_14]: That's not coming out until next year.

1714
02:05:56,028 --> 02:06:00,009
[SPEAKER_14]: Really, the only games that they showed that were coming out this year were Uncharted 2.

1715
02:06:03,061 --> 02:06:04,382
[SPEAKER_14]: And that's about it.

1716
02:06:04,502 --> 02:06:10,526
[SPEAKER_14]: So a lot of the stuff that they're talking about, maybe White Knight Chronicles, I'm not sure about that, but a lot of it is all next year.

1717
02:06:10,847 --> 02:06:12,328
[SPEAKER_14]: It's that 10-year plan.

1718
02:06:12,648 --> 02:06:21,214
[SPEAKER_14]: And that's great that you're announcing stuff that's coming out, but Microsoft is announcing stuff that's coming out this year and stuff that's coming out next year.

1719
02:06:21,534 --> 02:06:22,115
[SPEAKER_14]: And you know what?

1720
02:06:22,195 --> 02:06:25,617
[SPEAKER_14]: When it comes to next year, they will have more stuff to announce that's coming out.

1721
02:06:26,538 --> 02:06:27,258
[SPEAKER_14]: That's the thing.

1722
02:06:27,318 --> 02:06:29,040
[SPEAKER_14]: That's what separates those two companies.

1723
02:06:29,500 --> 02:06:30,481
[SPEAKER_14]: Sony likes to...

1724
02:06:31,633 --> 02:06:55,561
[SPEAKER_14]: promise a lot but it takes a long time for them to come through with what they promise and you know Microsoft does the same thing to a lesser extent I think but I've just gotten tired of listening to what Sony has to say and promise and know really what's going to happen like you know Final Fantasy 14 and granted that's not really up to Sony but probably not coming out in 2010.

1725
02:06:59,019 --> 02:07:00,019
[SPEAKER_13]: All right, we'll see.

1726
02:07:00,100 --> 02:07:00,920
[SPEAKER_13]: Was that it for emails?

1727
02:07:01,020 --> 02:07:01,420
[SPEAKER_13]: Any others?

1728
02:07:01,860 --> 02:07:02,921
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, there was more to that one.

1729
02:07:03,081 --> 02:07:04,361
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, okay.

1730
02:07:05,462 --> 02:07:10,604
[SPEAKER_05]: For those of you that care, there's been some interesting stuff happening in the PSN store within the last two weeks.

1731
02:07:11,184 --> 02:07:15,866
[SPEAKER_05]: Sony's been continuing to put more PS1 classics on there, most of which are pretty damn good.

1732
02:07:16,326 --> 02:07:21,248
[SPEAKER_05]: Two noticeable ones are Resident Evil Director's Cut, complete with Jill's sandwiches, and wait for it at Final Fantasy VII.

1733
02:07:23,900 --> 02:07:51,222
[SPEAKER_13]: I sure did and I have yet to play it because then I literally as Final Fantasy 7 was downloading I remembered that Final Fantasy 4 After Years had come out on Wii and I was like no I want to play that so I haven't gotten back to playing 7 yet keep in mind I was gone most of the week and that's good that they have stuff to download now some of their older Playstation 1 classics because they sure as hell aren't filling up their store full of new Playstation Network games

1734
02:07:53,618 --> 02:07:53,858
[SPEAKER_13]: True.

1735
02:07:54,299 --> 02:07:55,500
[SPEAKER_13]: I guess they need something to keep them afloat.

1736
02:07:55,760 --> 02:07:57,642
[SPEAKER_05]: There's more to this email.

1737
02:07:57,802 --> 02:07:59,384
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

1738
02:08:01,025 --> 02:08:01,426
[SPEAKER_05]: Where was I?

1739
02:08:01,526 --> 02:08:01,706
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

1740
02:08:02,507 --> 02:08:11,916
[SPEAKER_05]: Once Jack Trenton mentioned that Final Fantasy VII was coming to the US PSN store, nearly... This is nearly, I guess, supposed to say every Final Fantasy fan collectively just their pants.

1741
02:08:13,077 --> 02:08:13,217
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

1742
02:08:15,058 --> 02:08:19,919
[SPEAKER_05]: They also added a bunch of other stuff on the game side too numerous to mention.

1743
02:08:20,619 --> 02:08:29,181
[SPEAKER_05]: Additionally, they have expanded their offerings on the video side of the store to include somewhere in the ballpark of 10-15 more supported TV networks including Showtime and G4.

1744
02:08:29,861 --> 02:08:36,783
[SPEAKER_05]: Additionally, they're giving away for free two TV show pilots, Dexter from Showtime as well as Voltron.

1745
02:08:37,563 --> 02:08:41,084
[SPEAKER_05]: On a side note, although it's been on the video store

1746
02:08:42,284 --> 02:08:42,965
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1747
02:09:00,302 --> 02:09:02,564
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, thanks for taking the time to read my email.

1748
02:09:02,604 --> 02:09:03,164
[SPEAKER_05]: It's appreciated.

1749
02:09:03,244 --> 02:09:06,346
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, sorry, especially to DarkSakura, who usually ends up reading the emails.

1750
02:09:06,526 --> 02:09:08,407
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for such a long email.

1751
02:09:08,868 --> 02:09:13,831
[SPEAKER_14]: I do like how they are adding more anime studios to that, because I think that's something that diversifies them a little bit.

1752
02:09:13,871 --> 02:09:22,316
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm not sure what their anime coverage is for the 360, but I know... I don't think there's that much on there.

1753
02:09:22,636 --> 02:09:25,198
[SPEAKER_14]: But that's kind of cool to diversify themselves a little bit with that.

1754
02:09:28,320 --> 02:09:28,680
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know.

1755
02:09:28,740 --> 02:09:29,101
[SPEAKER_14]: It's just...

1756
02:09:31,394 --> 02:09:31,955
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1757
02:09:47,150 --> 02:09:48,691
[SPEAKER_14]: Are we going to get episodes of Cops and Cheaters?

1758
02:09:48,751 --> 02:09:50,872
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, is that going to be part of the lineup?

1759
02:09:51,692 --> 02:09:51,992
[SPEAKER_13]: Awesome.

1760
02:09:52,012 --> 02:09:57,355
[SPEAKER_13]: I want the Excuse My Beauty transsexual episode, which I believe was Albuquerque Police.

1761
02:09:57,775 --> 02:09:59,035
[SPEAKER_13]: I would pay for that episode.

1762
02:09:59,075 --> 02:09:59,996
[SPEAKER_13]: I would so I could watch that.

1763
02:10:00,816 --> 02:10:02,997
[SPEAKER_13]: Excuse My Beauty, officer.

1764
02:10:03,537 --> 02:10:05,158
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll go back to Arizona, I swear.

1765
02:10:06,219 --> 02:10:08,340
[SPEAKER_13]: If you haven't seen it, YouTube, Excuse My Beauty.

1766
02:10:08,720 --> 02:10:09,240
[SPEAKER_13]: It's amazing.

1767
02:10:10,848 --> 02:10:11,889
[SPEAKER_13]: Starcade, or something like that.

1768
02:10:12,830 --> 02:10:13,330
[SPEAKER_13]: But I doubt it.

1769
02:10:23,773 --> 02:10:26,916
[SPEAKER_13]: Xlink in chat wants to point out G4 is free on iTunes.

1770
02:10:27,396 --> 02:10:29,818
[SPEAKER_13]: Brad from PopCulture says Cops is on Hulu.

1771
02:10:29,858 --> 02:10:30,618
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, I didn't realize that.

1772
02:10:31,239 --> 02:10:36,642
[SPEAKER_13]: Sephiroth1215 says, speaking about the Sony press conference, I mean, we have to think of the years as fiscal.

1773
02:10:36,782 --> 02:10:42,847
[SPEAKER_13]: A lot of companies end their fiscal years in March so they can release games up until that point and be keeping the truth of coming out this year.

1774
02:10:44,728 --> 02:10:45,248
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes and no.

1775
02:10:45,328 --> 02:10:48,170
[SPEAKER_13]: I still think a lot of this stuff when they say 2010, they don't mean March.

1776
02:10:48,371 --> 02:10:49,591
[SPEAKER_13]: They mean like October.

1777
02:10:49,611 --> 02:10:52,914
[SPEAKER_14]: They should say this fiscal year instead of this year because that, I'm sorry, that's,

1778
02:10:54,944 --> 02:11:20,417
[SPEAKER_13]: I think the only games that might come out before holiday 2010 are Final Fantasy XIII at least in Japan and that's why I don't think XIV is going to come out in 2010 because I think XIII is going to barely make the holidays but it's a different team working on it so I could see that happening that would be so weird if that happened and then God of War 3 I think will come out early no you don't think so?

1779
02:11:20,598 --> 02:11:21,438
[SPEAKER_14]: March for sure

1780
02:11:22,327 --> 02:11:22,707
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, March.

1781
02:11:23,808 --> 02:11:24,068
[SPEAKER_13]: Not.

1782
02:11:24,288 --> 02:11:25,288
[SPEAKER_14]: They already announced it's March.

1783
02:11:25,369 --> 02:11:25,649
[SPEAKER_13]: I see.

1784
02:11:25,989 --> 02:11:27,670
[SPEAKER_13]: So, well, okay, then that's before the holidays.

1785
02:11:28,050 --> 02:11:30,331
[SPEAKER_14]: Uncharted 2 will be the big holiday game for them.

1786
02:11:30,991 --> 02:11:34,773
[SPEAKER_14]: Mag was another game that they were showing off that I don't know if it's going to be out this year.

1787
02:11:35,473 --> 02:11:35,974
[SPEAKER_14]: It looked cool.

1788
02:11:36,174 --> 02:11:37,254
[SPEAKER_14]: I watched people playing it.

1789
02:11:37,374 --> 02:11:47,059
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, if you're into Call of Duty and stuff, you're really going to enjoy that game because it's a massive battleground, basically, of everything that you've seen in Call of Duty and

1790
02:11:48,359 --> 02:12:03,302
[SPEAKER_14]: all your multiplayer first person shooter games so that'd be kind of cool if that comes out this year I'm not sure if it is I would hope that they put out Gran Turismo 5 this year because I think they kind of have to you know with Forza 3 coming out I mean

1791
02:12:05,456 --> 02:12:06,617
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know.

1792
02:12:07,858 --> 02:12:12,082
[SPEAKER_14]: And then as far as what they're going to fill in the rest of the year with, that's a good question.

1793
02:12:12,723 --> 02:12:13,644
[SPEAKER_14]: Because I don't really know.

1794
02:12:14,324 --> 02:12:18,669
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, Heavy Rain is supposed to be coming out this year, I thought.

1795
02:12:19,369 --> 02:12:21,271
[SPEAKER_14]: That wasn't even there at all.

1796
02:12:21,852 --> 02:12:22,192
[SPEAKER_14]: Nothing.

1797
02:12:24,514 --> 02:12:25,415
[SPEAKER_14]: No mention of it at all.

1798
02:12:26,303 --> 02:12:26,623
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

1799
02:12:27,684 --> 02:12:29,565
[SPEAKER_13]: I believe that was all the emails we got.

1800
02:12:29,765 --> 02:12:32,807
[SPEAKER_13]: So if you want to send us more, mailbag at orangelandredo.com.

1801
02:12:33,428 --> 02:12:42,494
[SPEAKER_13]: Let's move on to Microsoft, and then we'll let Loki throw in anything else he wants to, because I know he's probably got some other games he wants to talk about, and then wrap up with just a couple phone calls.

1802
02:12:42,534 --> 02:12:47,437
[SPEAKER_13]: Probably not going to take a lot of phone calls tonight, just because we've been chatting a long time tonight, but we'll do what we can.

1803
02:12:48,198 --> 02:12:52,260
[SPEAKER_13]: Anyhow, I want to talk about Microsoft and some of the things they talked about at their press conference.

1804
02:12:52,280 --> 02:12:54,862
[SPEAKER_13]: Let's just start with the big one, which is Project Natal.

1805
02:12:56,483 --> 02:13:22,322
[SPEAKER_13]: which obviously you know I'm pretty sure you guys are all aware it's the motion controller that's camera only there is no controller with it I don't know if you've watched the trailer that goes with it but it's very interesting because the scene that struck me specifically was when the girl walks into the room and the Xbox 360 know who she is and she gets a phone call from her friend or whatever on the 360 and her friend says hey I picked out this cute new outfit for you you should try it on

1806
02:13:22,622 --> 02:13:23,722
[SPEAKER_13]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1807
02:13:42,833 --> 02:13:47,435
[SPEAKER_13]: Anyhow, all that aside, let's just talk about Project Natal.

1808
02:13:47,495 --> 02:13:48,736
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know, Loki, what were your thoughts?

1809
02:13:49,697 --> 02:13:50,437
[SPEAKER_14]: I think it's really cool.

1810
02:13:50,717 --> 02:13:54,579
[SPEAKER_14]: I thought, wow, this is really good, and it set them apart from Nintendo.

1811
02:13:54,919 --> 02:14:00,722
[SPEAKER_14]: They can do a lot more with this if it actually lives up to all the stuff that they say it can do.

1812
02:14:00,942 --> 02:14:10,127
[SPEAKER_14]: And, I mean, they have kind of demonstrated, you know, their live demonstration of how, like, playing that giant breakout game, which...

1813
02:14:11,155 --> 02:14:11,996
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1814
02:14:27,262 --> 02:14:38,729
[SPEAKER_14]: It looked easy to use, looked very intuitive, and I like some of the... I mean, it's very unnecessary as far as browsing your menus and stuff by swishing your hand around.

1815
02:14:39,109 --> 02:14:43,052
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, that's cool and all, but I'll just use the controller because it's a lot faster.

1816
02:14:43,252 --> 02:14:44,893
[SPEAKER_14]: But, you have the option.

1817
02:14:45,153 --> 02:14:46,794
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, you don't have to do it that way.

1818
02:14:47,815 --> 02:14:51,877
[SPEAKER_14]: But then again, if I'm trying to shoo away my cat, I don't want it moving through menus.

1819
02:14:52,438 --> 02:14:52,578
[SPEAKER_14]: So...

1820
02:14:54,962 --> 02:14:56,227
[SPEAKER_14]: We'll see how that ends up.

1821
02:14:56,488 --> 02:14:57,351
[SPEAKER_14]: It could be really cool.

1822
02:14:59,266 --> 02:14:59,626
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know.

1823
02:14:59,726 --> 02:15:02,708
[SPEAKER_14]: If they could come up with maybe like a one-handed controller or something like that.

1824
02:15:02,748 --> 02:15:07,610
[SPEAKER_14]: Something really small, almost like the Nunchuck or something, so you can, you know, say like you're playing... The Buzz controller.

1825
02:15:07,951 --> 02:15:09,151
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm not Buzz, sorry.

1826
02:15:09,171 --> 02:15:10,032
[SPEAKER_13]: The Scenic controller.

1827
02:15:10,272 --> 02:15:11,052
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, something like that.

1828
02:15:11,092 --> 02:15:17,676
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, very small, so you can have some of that, you know, controller stuff and then doing your motion stuff with your other hands or something.

1829
02:15:18,136 --> 02:15:21,898
[SPEAKER_14]: Like, some of the things I think were unnecessary, like they showed in the video, like the driving.

1830
02:15:22,158 --> 02:15:24,579
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't want to have to hold my hands out like a steering wheel.

1831
02:15:25,480 --> 02:15:26,200
[SPEAKER_14]: That's not for me.

1832
02:15:26,600 --> 02:15:27,601
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, I'd rather...

1833
02:15:28,846 --> 02:15:30,687
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1834
02:15:55,868 --> 02:15:56,969
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1835
02:16:12,768 --> 02:16:13,328
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1836
02:16:42,877 --> 02:16:43,804
[SPEAKER_13]: So, I don't know.

1837
02:16:43,824 --> 02:16:44,206
[SPEAKER_13]: We'll see.

1838
02:16:45,359 --> 02:16:47,140
[SPEAKER_05]: That sounds like a prescription drugs name, by the way.

1839
02:16:47,340 --> 02:16:51,121
[SPEAKER_13]: I am extremely, extremely skeptical about this.

1840
02:16:51,681 --> 02:16:55,022
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't think it's going to work as nice as they're showing it in these trailers and things.

1841
02:16:55,062 --> 02:16:59,644
[SPEAKER_13]: And this whole concept of people don't want to have buttons and stuff, that's just not true.

1842
02:17:00,104 --> 02:17:01,965
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm sorry, but I don't think that's true.

1843
02:17:02,365 --> 02:17:06,286
[SPEAKER_13]: And the whole thing about, well, people get intimidated by all these buttons and things.

1844
02:17:06,726 --> 02:17:07,306
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't buy it.

1845
02:17:07,566 --> 02:17:08,087
[SPEAKER_13]: You know what?

1846
02:17:08,167 --> 02:17:10,588
[SPEAKER_13]: There's one device everybody knows how to use.

1847
02:17:11,148 --> 02:17:12,848
[SPEAKER_13]: Everybody fights over it all the time.

1848
02:17:13,108 --> 02:17:14,689
[SPEAKER_13]: When somebody loses it, people...

1849
02:17:15,069 --> 02:17:15,970
[SPEAKER_13]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1850
02:17:38,982 --> 02:17:39,602
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura.com

1851
02:17:57,668 --> 02:17:57,988
[SPEAKER_13]: Hub.

1852
02:17:58,088 --> 02:17:58,789
[SPEAKER_13]: I get it, I get it.

1853
02:17:58,829 --> 02:18:06,615
[SPEAKER_13]: They're gonna have that, but I just, you know, the fanboys are going crazy with this 360 thing, and I'm sorry, you know, call me whatever name you want.

1854
02:18:06,975 --> 02:18:13,140
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm extremely skeptical about this whole thing, and I have a right to be, because the Xbox Vision camera sucks.

1855
02:18:13,780 --> 02:18:14,480
[SPEAKER_13]: It sucks.

1856
02:18:15,100 --> 02:18:16,341
[SPEAKER_13]: What can you do with that camera?

1857
02:18:16,361 --> 02:18:16,841
[SPEAKER_13]: Exactly.

1858
02:18:17,241 --> 02:18:19,982
[SPEAKER_13]: Especially compared to what they showed us years ago.

1859
02:18:20,182 --> 02:18:25,424
[SPEAKER_13]: When they first showed us the camera, we were promised all these games that were going to integrate the camera.

1860
02:18:25,744 --> 02:18:26,464
[SPEAKER_13]: And what do you have?

1861
02:18:26,524 --> 02:18:28,925
[SPEAKER_13]: You have Uno and some of the other Xbox Live Arcade games.

1862
02:18:29,265 --> 02:18:32,827
[SPEAKER_13]: And a couple third-party developers threw us a few bones there with the EA.

1863
02:18:33,167 --> 02:18:35,207
[SPEAKER_13]: You have the Burnout license plate.

1864
02:18:35,267 --> 02:18:36,068
[SPEAKER_13]: Big fucking deal.

1865
02:18:36,468 --> 02:18:39,429
[SPEAKER_13]: And then you have the You're in the Movies.

1866
02:18:40,635 --> 02:18:41,777
[SPEAKER_13]: and then Totem Ball.

1867
02:18:42,418 --> 02:18:47,969
[SPEAKER_13]: And remember when Totem Ball kind of looked fun from the previews that we were shown at that E3 when the vision camera was announced?

1868
02:18:48,269 --> 02:18:50,153
[SPEAKER_13]: Now, Totem Ball might have actually been kind of cool.

1869
02:18:50,573 --> 02:18:51,956
[SPEAKER_13]: It was shit.

1870
02:18:53,007 --> 02:19:22,927
[SPEAKER_13]: and the way you controlled that whole thing it doesn't the same thing with the eye toy it is never picking up your body correctly it doesn't see your motion right if you don't have exactly the right lighting in your house the thing sucks and if you don't believe me check out some of those eye toy games on the Playstation 2 they're terrible so I think seeing this whole you know motion and movement is how we're going to control our games I am extremely skeptical about it I have a right to be I've seen this before and it sucks why should I feel any different?

1871
02:19:22,987 --> 02:19:23,828
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1872
02:19:41,809 --> 02:19:46,896
[SPEAKER_14]: Microsoft bought the company and now they're working exclusively with them to put out this technology.

1873
02:19:47,196 --> 02:19:53,765
[SPEAKER_14]: And I do understand, you know, trust me, I bought cameras for all those systems and they all piss me off.

1874
02:19:53,885 --> 02:19:57,550
[SPEAKER_14]: And yes, I'm very skeptical on buying another camera that...

1875
02:19:58,908 --> 02:19:59,649
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1876
02:20:26,365 --> 02:20:30,088
[SPEAKER_14]: Johnny Chung Lee, the guy who did head tracking with the Wii, is working on Natal.

1877
02:20:30,108 --> 02:20:31,729
[SPEAKER_14]: It has to work because he is pure genius.

1878
02:20:50,001 --> 02:20:58,165
[SPEAKER_13]: TigerClaw says, in order for it to pick up the entire room, it's got to be a widescreen view of the area so that everyone can be involved, insinuating that it's probably a widescreen camera.

1879
02:20:58,385 --> 02:21:01,426
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, it's a camera, but it's also got other sensors on it, too.

1880
02:21:01,527 --> 02:21:04,288
[SPEAKER_14]: So it's not just, you know, it's going to be infrared.

1881
02:21:04,388 --> 02:21:11,211
[SPEAKER_14]: I think it's infrared, because it looks like there's two infrared sensors on it or something, unless those are just indicator lights for different stuff.

1882
02:21:11,531 --> 02:21:14,813
[SPEAKER_14]: But yeah, the camera's really wide, and it...

1883
02:21:15,373 --> 02:21:15,915
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1884
02:21:23,505 --> 02:21:24,785
[SPEAKER_13]: I want to keep reading comments from chat.

1885
02:21:24,825 --> 02:21:25,806
[SPEAKER_13]: Great stuff from chat tonight.

1886
02:21:26,066 --> 02:21:36,968
[SPEAKER_13]: Sephiroth1215 says, I feel more satisfied with the Sony Wiimote because while it might just be practically the same, it will be nice to play games with it that are meant for the core gamer, which Nintendo doesn't do.

1887
02:21:37,708 --> 02:21:43,690
[SPEAKER_13]: Ziba says, and in all the videos I've seen with it, their living rooms have so much room in front of the TV.

1888
02:21:44,130 --> 02:21:47,290
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know any house that has that much room in front of the TV like that.

1889
02:21:48,171 --> 02:21:49,151
[SPEAKER_05]: It's also a set.

1890
02:21:49,831 --> 02:21:51,412
[SPEAKER_13]: True, but I mean, that makes a good point.

1891
02:21:52,473 --> 02:21:54,854
[SPEAKER_13]: Will this work in close quarters as well as far away?

1892
02:21:54,914 --> 02:21:57,656
[SPEAKER_05]: I can tell you for certain, my living room is really small.

1893
02:21:57,936 --> 02:21:59,857
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, how do you play Wii Sports and Wii Bowling?

1894
02:21:59,897 --> 02:22:01,478
[SPEAKER_14]: Because I know that takes up some space.

1895
02:22:02,499 --> 02:22:09,143
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, I know when we're playing Wii Bowling and Wii Sports and stuff like that, we push out the coffee table, move it out of the way.

1896
02:22:09,383 --> 02:22:12,545
[SPEAKER_14]: And yeah, I know it's just one of the requirements.

1897
02:22:12,565 --> 02:22:14,106
[SPEAKER_13]: You've got to have space.

1898
02:22:14,246 --> 02:22:15,787
[SPEAKER_13]: And guys, don't get me wrong.

1899
02:22:15,847 --> 02:22:18,229
[SPEAKER_13]: When I say I'm skeptical, that doesn't mean I hate it.

1900
02:22:18,789 --> 02:22:19,870
[SPEAKER_13]: I think it's a great idea.

1901
02:22:19,990 --> 02:22:26,213
[SPEAKER_13]: If they pull off everything they're promising, I will bow down and suck Xbox's cock.

1902
02:22:27,513 --> 02:22:31,195
[SPEAKER_13]: It truly is one of the greatest things I've ever seen in that case.

1903
02:22:31,495 --> 02:22:34,656
[SPEAKER_13]: But excuse me if I'm a little bit skeptical.

1904
02:22:35,397 --> 02:22:38,018
[SPEAKER_13]: I think I have a right based on some of the crap we've seen before.

1905
02:22:38,238 --> 02:22:38,518
[SPEAKER_13]: Right?

1906
02:22:39,299 --> 02:22:40,099
[SPEAKER_05]: I fully agree.

1907
02:22:42,420 --> 02:22:45,261
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm just cautiously optimistic.

1908
02:22:45,642 --> 02:22:46,442
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, that's fair.

1909
02:22:46,962 --> 02:22:48,163
[SPEAKER_14]: Cautiously optimistic.

1910
02:22:49,207 --> 02:22:53,572
[SPEAKER_14]: Optimistic to the point of if this ends up being crap, then yes, I'm not going to buy it.

1911
02:22:53,852 --> 02:22:57,156
[SPEAKER_14]: But I need to see it actually being utilized.

1912
02:22:57,176 --> 02:23:04,103
[SPEAKER_14]: And I trust that Microsoft would probably understand that, you know what, this isn't going to be just for the casual gamer.

1913
02:23:04,243 --> 02:23:08,768
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's implement this and maybe some other stuff and see what we can do with it.

1914
02:23:10,359 --> 02:23:13,361
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright, moving on to some other topics because we have a lot of ground to cover.

1915
02:23:13,401 --> 02:23:17,724
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm sure some of the callers are going to want to revisit this because probably Natal is the thing that's got the biggest buzz out of E3.

1916
02:23:17,764 --> 02:23:19,045
[SPEAKER_13]: I do want to mention this.

1917
02:23:19,265 --> 02:23:24,088
[SPEAKER_13]: Speaking of buzz, my Twitter has filled up with blah blah blah about 1 versus 100.

1918
02:23:24,128 --> 02:23:33,234
[SPEAKER_13]: And I feel completely out of the loop because I have yet to play it because I've not been home when all these beta tests have been going on or what have you.

1919
02:23:33,414 --> 02:23:34,855
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know why.

1920
02:23:35,575 --> 02:23:37,096
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a freaking game show.

1921
02:23:38,297 --> 02:23:38,697
[SPEAKER_13]: You know what?

1922
02:23:38,737 --> 02:23:41,219
[SPEAKER_13]: If so many people are saying good things about it, there must be something good about it.

1923
02:23:41,259 --> 02:23:42,279
[SPEAKER_13]: People are having fun with it.

1924
02:23:42,519 --> 02:23:43,400
[SPEAKER_13]: That's what games are supposed to be.

1925
02:23:43,420 --> 02:23:44,181
[SPEAKER_05]: They're welcome to it.

1926
02:23:44,861 --> 02:23:45,461
[SPEAKER_13]: So, I don't know.

1927
02:23:45,501 --> 02:23:47,202
[SPEAKER_13]: Loki, you just got home today.

1928
02:23:47,222 --> 02:23:48,083
[SPEAKER_13]: Of course you haven't tried it.

1929
02:23:48,103 --> 02:23:48,703
[SPEAKER_14]: Of course not.

1930
02:23:49,384 --> 02:23:50,444
[SPEAKER_13]: I definitely want to check it out.

1931
02:23:51,945 --> 02:23:53,586
[SPEAKER_13]: It's so freaking popular on Twitter.

1932
02:23:53,606 --> 02:23:56,328
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm surprised it's not in the trending topics so many people talk about it.

1933
02:23:56,688 --> 02:23:59,590
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, some of the other things that were mentioned at Microsoft's press conference.

1934
02:23:59,630 --> 02:24:00,171
[SPEAKER_13]: Left 4 Dead 2.

1935
02:24:01,874 --> 02:24:03,616
[SPEAKER_14]: That's got a lot of people pissed off.

1936
02:24:03,856 --> 02:24:05,598
[SPEAKER_14]: It looked cool, I thought, to me.

1937
02:24:05,878 --> 02:24:09,522
[SPEAKER_14]: When I first saw it, I thought there was this one game that was supposed to be coming out.

1938
02:24:09,622 --> 02:24:14,146
[SPEAKER_14]: It was like Voodoo something or other that had Samuel L. Jackson doing the voice of the main character.

1939
02:24:14,547 --> 02:24:16,649
[SPEAKER_14]: I thought that's what that was, and then they were all left for dead too.

1940
02:24:16,669 --> 02:24:19,432
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm like, oh, I guess it could be that too.

1941
02:24:20,052 --> 02:24:20,493
[SPEAKER_14]: But, um...

1942
02:24:21,618 --> 02:24:23,419
[SPEAKER_14]: A lot of people are just shouting too soon.

1943
02:24:23,579 --> 02:24:26,760
[SPEAKER_14]: In fact, there's a petition already with 13,000 people on it.

1944
02:24:27,860 --> 02:24:30,501
[SPEAKER_14]: Petitions online don't really do anything, but whatever.

1945
02:24:31,181 --> 02:24:36,143
[SPEAKER_14]: That are saying it's too soon, that they didn't support the first game enough, and that Valve's cashing in.

1946
02:24:36,663 --> 02:24:39,604
[SPEAKER_14]: Honestly, if you ask me, I think that you've been spoiled by Valve.

1947
02:24:39,644 --> 02:24:42,305
[SPEAKER_14]: And so now they're actually putting out another game.

1948
02:24:44,185 --> 02:24:44,765
[SPEAKER_14]: So what?

1949
02:24:44,965 --> 02:24:46,466
[SPEAKER_14]: Don't pick it up if you don't want to pick it up.

1950
02:24:47,894 --> 02:24:48,955
[SPEAKER_13]: Wait for it to go on sale.

1951
02:24:49,256 --> 02:24:50,417
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, wait for it to go on sale.

1952
02:24:50,557 --> 02:24:53,801
[SPEAKER_13]: They always have these crazy ass sales six months, a year later.

1953
02:24:54,041 --> 02:25:01,849
[SPEAKER_14]: No one's forcing you to buy it, but people are pissed off because they've been spoiled with all Team Fortress 2 updates on PC.

1954
02:25:02,390 --> 02:25:05,873
[SPEAKER_14]: Not on 360, but on PC and all the other stuff.

1955
02:25:07,195 --> 02:25:08,296
[SPEAKER_14]: Whatever, dude.

1956
02:25:08,376 --> 02:25:09,177
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, seriously.

1957
02:25:11,169 --> 02:25:13,812
[SPEAKER_14]: Just, it's in a different setting, okay?

1958
02:25:14,853 --> 02:25:15,253
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know.

1959
02:25:16,354 --> 02:25:22,079
[SPEAKER_14]: Different setting, you've got a little bit different game modes in there.

1960
02:25:23,981 --> 02:25:26,043
[SPEAKER_14]: If that's enough for you to buy another game, then buy it.

1961
02:25:26,163 --> 02:25:27,685
[SPEAKER_14]: If not, then don't.

1962
02:25:27,965 --> 02:25:31,288
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, but Left 4 Dead has hugely rabid fans in it.

1963
02:25:31,588 --> 02:25:32,569
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm sure there's tons of people.

1964
02:25:32,910 --> 02:25:33,971
[SPEAKER_13]: This thing's going to sell like crazy.

1965
02:25:33,991 --> 02:25:35,152
[SPEAKER_05]: Rabid indicates disease.

1966
02:25:36,021 --> 02:25:37,522
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1967
02:25:58,450 --> 02:26:03,454
[SPEAKER_14]: The fact that Left 4 Dead 2 is nearly identical to Left 4 Dead 1 and will decimate the community of both games.

1968
02:26:04,275 --> 02:26:08,738
[SPEAKER_14]: The announced date is not nearly enough time to polish content or make significant gameplay changes.

1969
02:26:09,159 --> 02:26:27,174
[SPEAKER_14]: Which, all these are really assumptions on the development process, and since none of these people actually work for Valve, then I don't really know where they're actually, you know, how they're able to make these comments actually, you know, with... I seem to recall Left 4 Dead got some pretty awesome support after it came out, like there was a free pack that came out afterwards with some new stuff, you know...

1970
02:26:28,140 --> 02:26:30,120
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know, I think you guys have it pretty good.

1971
02:26:53,285 --> 02:26:55,446
[SPEAKER_14]: or not 4, 5 taking place in Africa and guess what?

1972
02:26:55,486 --> 02:26:57,066
[SPEAKER_14]: It was bright and cheery but there's zombies.

1973
02:26:57,346 --> 02:26:58,787
[SPEAKER_14]: Did anyone bitch about that?

1974
02:26:58,967 --> 02:26:59,207
[SPEAKER_14]: No.

1975
02:27:00,607 --> 02:27:07,329
[SPEAKER_14]: The fiddle based horde music is extremely disliked though differently orchestrated music is otherwise welcome.

1976
02:27:08,089 --> 02:27:20,272
[SPEAKER_14]: Left 4 Dead 2's release will result in a drop of quality and frequency of Left 4 Dead 1 content even compared to before and the community has lost faith in Valve's former reputation for commitment to their games post-release.

1977
02:27:23,172 --> 02:27:24,473
[SPEAKER_14]: is what I hear because you know what?

1978
02:27:24,513 --> 02:27:29,718
[SPEAKER_14]: When I went to Microsoft's booth and EA's booth, guess where the lines were?

1979
02:27:29,878 --> 02:27:30,659
[SPEAKER_14]: For Left 4 Dead 2.

1980
02:27:31,119 --> 02:27:34,763
[SPEAKER_14]: So go suck it because enough people out there fucking love that game.

1981
02:27:35,183 --> 02:27:36,645
[SPEAKER_14]: At least wait until the game comes out.

1982
02:27:36,725 --> 02:27:37,305
[SPEAKER_13]: Exactly.

1983
02:27:37,325 --> 02:27:38,166
[SPEAKER_13]: It's way too early to start.

1984
02:27:38,166 --> 02:27:38,586
[SPEAKER_13]: DarkSakura.com

1985
02:28:04,913 --> 02:28:17,764
[SPEAKER_13]: The Halo series has Halo Reach and Halo ODST Talk about milking a franchise Holy shit Oh, Halo's done Oh, no it's not We need to put out some more prequels

1986
02:28:19,978 --> 02:28:21,919
[SPEAKER_14]: There won't be a Halo 4, but damn it.

1987
02:28:22,539 --> 02:28:26,061
[SPEAKER_14]: ODST looks kind of okay.

1988
02:28:26,101 --> 02:28:28,742
[SPEAKER_14]: Gameplay-wise, I don't know what they're really going to do different than Halo 3.

1989
02:28:29,502 --> 02:28:41,166
[SPEAKER_14]: And just to make sure that you're a sucker and buy ODST, they're throwing in a bunch of freebies, and they're also going to throw in a beta to Halo Reach, which we don't even know what the hell it is yet, other than it's going to be another prequel.

1990
02:28:42,607 --> 02:28:43,067
[SPEAKER_14]: Awesome.

1991
02:28:44,547 --> 02:28:45,828
[SPEAKER_14]: Not interested in it one bit.

1992
02:28:46,747 --> 02:28:49,829
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, and they're going to have a collector's edition, as they have to do with every Halo game.

1993
02:28:50,129 --> 02:28:53,752
[SPEAKER_14]: And they're going to include another Xbox 360 controller.

1994
02:28:53,972 --> 02:28:56,914
[SPEAKER_14]: No, just an Xbox 360 controller that has special painting on it.

1995
02:28:57,774 --> 02:28:59,335
[SPEAKER_13]: Wow, are you a... Do you have a functional D-pad?

1996
02:29:00,656 --> 02:29:02,777
[SPEAKER_13]: No, but it's camo.

1997
02:29:03,718 --> 02:29:07,801
[SPEAKER_13]: Brad from PodCulture in chat comments, ODST has Nathan Fillion.

1998
02:29:08,841 --> 02:29:14,405
[SPEAKER_14]: So... Oh, well then that's perfect for all those fanboys out there who love Nathan Fillion.

1999
02:29:17,009 --> 02:29:19,170
[SPEAKER_14]: Crackdown 2 Crackdown 2 Crackdown 2

2000
02:29:40,820 --> 02:29:43,683
[SPEAKER_14]: and they're also going to have 16 player deathmatch in it which is awesome.

2001
02:29:44,603 --> 02:29:45,864
[SPEAKER_13]: How about Shadow Complex?

2002
02:29:45,924 --> 02:29:53,311
[SPEAKER_13]: This is the one that Cliffy B came out and you all think it's going to be Gears of War 3 but nope, it's a game called Shadow Complex which is an Xbox Live Arcade game.

2003
02:29:53,691 --> 02:29:55,292
[SPEAKER_13]: Kind of looks like Bionic Commando Rearmed.

2004
02:29:56,593 --> 02:30:05,341
[SPEAKER_14]: I think it was supposed to be more like Castlevania and Metroid is kind of what they were comparing it to and it looked neat.

2005
02:30:07,583 --> 02:30:08,143
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know...

2006
02:30:10,262 --> 02:30:12,403
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

2007
02:30:39,738 --> 02:30:40,879
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com

2008
02:30:59,079 --> 02:31:02,181
[SPEAKER_14]: Not really my cup of tea, but it's a neat feature.

2009
02:31:02,661 --> 02:31:07,563
[SPEAKER_14]: And then also kind of including the same stuff that they had in Forza 2 with all the designing cars.

2010
02:31:07,923 --> 02:31:12,406
[SPEAKER_14]: They kind of spent a little bit much, a lot of time on the whole designing cars thing.

2011
02:31:12,426 --> 02:31:15,687
[SPEAKER_14]: Like, oh, it's a way for me to express myself and stuff like that.

2012
02:31:16,107 --> 02:31:21,810
[SPEAKER_14]: That was a little bit of, I don't know, ridiculous if you ask me.

2013
02:31:21,890 --> 02:31:25,232
[SPEAKER_14]: Because, dude, just, I don't know.

2014
02:31:26,502 --> 02:31:28,123
[SPEAKER_14]: Draw something on paper or something.

2015
02:31:28,223 --> 02:31:28,603
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know.

2016
02:31:28,683 --> 02:31:31,504
[SPEAKER_14]: Seriously, there's other ways to express yourself, not this game.

2017
02:31:31,684 --> 02:31:35,325
[SPEAKER_14]: This game didn't just come out and go, oh my god, now I can actually express myself for the first time.

2018
02:31:36,186 --> 02:31:38,106
[SPEAKER_05]: I express myself through playing The Sims.

2019
02:31:39,187 --> 02:31:45,689
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, maybe you can upload some of these high-def videos and pictures to the brand new Facebook integration on Xbox Live.

2020
02:31:45,889 --> 02:31:48,350
[SPEAKER_13]: But wait, wait, it doesn't stop there.

2021
02:31:48,490 --> 02:31:50,431
[SPEAKER_13]: Twitter on Xbox Live as well.

2022
02:31:51,004 --> 02:31:52,725
[SPEAKER_14]: The Facebook thing actually looked kind of cool.

2023
02:31:52,745 --> 02:31:58,307
[SPEAKER_14]: The only reason it looked cool is because you can actually... Upcoming games are going to support this in-game screenshot thing.

2024
02:31:58,827 --> 02:31:59,487
[SPEAKER_14]: That's kind of neat.

2025
02:32:00,228 --> 02:32:01,128
[SPEAKER_14]: That's kind of neat.

2026
02:32:02,588 --> 02:32:03,989
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know about Facebook and Twitter.

2027
02:32:04,109 --> 02:32:06,050
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, I don't use Twitter that much.

2028
02:32:06,150 --> 02:32:08,011
[SPEAKER_14]: And Facebook, I really don't use that much.

2029
02:32:08,111 --> 02:32:09,611
[SPEAKER_14]: So, it'll be neat.

2030
02:32:10,111 --> 02:32:11,452
[SPEAKER_14]: And I'm glad that they're adding more things.

2031
02:32:13,066 --> 02:32:27,078
[SPEAKER_14]: web browser, please just add a web browser don't need all these things, just add a web browser guess what, I can go to facebook.com or I can go to twitter.com and add tweets that way I have facebook on my iphone so I don't need anything else

2032
02:32:27,868 --> 02:32:28,889
[SPEAKER_13]: at a web browser.

2033
02:32:29,850 --> 02:32:34,393
[SPEAKER_13]: And, and, and, not just that, Last.fm was another integration they announced.

2034
02:32:34,493 --> 02:32:35,153
[SPEAKER_13]: That's pretty cool.

2035
02:32:36,074 --> 02:32:41,218
[SPEAKER_13]: So that you'll be able to, I guess, stream the Last.fm radio, I'm assuming, to the Xbox 360.

2036
02:32:41,538 --> 02:32:42,859
[SPEAKER_13]: I kind of took that assumption.

2037
02:32:43,299 --> 02:32:45,020
[SPEAKER_13]: Or it's going to track your plays from the 360.

2038
02:32:45,781 --> 02:32:47,282
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm not sure exactly how that's working.

2039
02:32:49,758 --> 02:32:58,582
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't really use Last.fm, so exactly what kind of stations are we talking like music hosted on servers and we can stream stations based on artists?

2040
02:32:58,622 --> 02:32:59,462
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, here's the thing.

2041
02:32:59,642 --> 02:33:05,705
[SPEAKER_13]: On Last.fm, it basically tracks everything you play using a scrabbler, everything that you play.

2042
02:33:06,165 --> 02:33:09,327
[SPEAKER_13]: So what you can do once you've tracked some of your listening things...

2043
02:33:09,727 --> 02:33:09,907
[SPEAKER_13]: Podcasts

2044
02:33:38,091 --> 02:33:41,133
[SPEAKER_13]: Funny enough, if you listen to podcasts on iTunes, they get scrabbled.

2045
02:33:43,255 --> 02:33:48,098
[SPEAKER_13]: There's an entry for Orange Lounge Radio on Last.fm because people listen to our show, and so it goes into there.

2046
02:33:48,479 --> 02:33:54,223
[SPEAKER_13]: But I wouldn't think that this integration is going to mean that the podcasts are suddenly going to be listed.

2047
02:33:54,243 --> 02:33:55,624
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't think it's going to do anything for us.

2048
02:33:56,065 --> 02:33:58,226
[SPEAKER_13]: But yeah, podcasts are a small part of Last.fm.

2049
02:33:58,286 --> 02:33:58,747
[SPEAKER_13]: Very small.

2050
02:33:58,787 --> 02:33:58,867
[SPEAKER_13]: Neat.

2051
02:34:02,273 --> 02:34:03,154
[SPEAKER_13]: I know, it could be interesting.

2052
02:34:04,334 --> 02:34:06,536
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm not sure, you know, we need to kind of hear more about it.

2053
02:34:06,916 --> 02:34:08,277
[SPEAKER_13]: But that was kind of a surprise.

2054
02:34:09,058 --> 02:34:14,521
[SPEAKER_13]: Some of the other things that they talked about at the press conference, Final Fantasy XIII actually running on the Xbox 360, which looked fun.

2055
02:34:14,762 --> 02:34:16,683
[SPEAKER_13]: Big deal, looked like the PlayStation 3 one.

2056
02:34:16,883 --> 02:34:18,004
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, not a big surprise there.

2057
02:34:18,024 --> 02:34:19,425
[SPEAKER_13]: Which we all knew it kind of should.

2058
02:34:20,706 --> 02:34:22,547
[SPEAKER_14]: Metal Gear Solid Rising.

2059
02:34:22,867 --> 02:34:23,748
[SPEAKER_14]: Not 4, Rising.

2060
02:34:24,088 --> 02:34:26,229
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, we knew that the Raiden Metal Gear Solid was coming out.

2061
02:34:26,289 --> 02:34:26,810
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, that's...

2062
02:34:28,515 --> 02:34:29,256
[SPEAKER_14]: We already knew that.

2063
02:34:29,376 --> 02:34:30,296
[SPEAKER_14]: It wasn't a big surprise.

2064
02:34:31,137 --> 02:34:35,699
[SPEAKER_13]: But boy, when Kojima walked out on that stage, I bet there were a lot of people thinking, here it is.

2065
02:34:36,220 --> 02:34:36,780
[SPEAKER_13]: Here it is.

2066
02:34:37,020 --> 02:34:38,961
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, they were thinking, oh.

2067
02:34:39,822 --> 02:34:41,743
[SPEAKER_14]: And I love the way they worded it.

2068
02:34:41,803 --> 02:34:43,924
[SPEAKER_14]: Now the Metal Gear franchise has come to the 360.

2069
02:34:45,805 --> 02:34:47,546
[SPEAKER_14]: And they made it sound like it was exclusive.

2070
02:34:48,687 --> 02:34:49,207
[SPEAKER_13]: But it's not.

2071
02:34:50,028 --> 02:34:50,168
[SPEAKER_13]: No.

2072
02:34:50,708 --> 02:34:50,828
[SPEAKER_13]: No.

2073
02:34:50,928 --> 02:34:52,269
[SPEAKER_13]: Metal Gear Solid Rising is not.

2074
02:34:52,659 --> 02:34:57,943
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, and I think this just cements, and I better not hear it ever again.

2075
02:34:58,304 --> 02:35:00,806
[SPEAKER_13]: Metal Gear Solid 4 is not coming to the 360.

2076
02:35:01,626 --> 02:35:04,348
[SPEAKER_13]: If it was, you would have heard it this year at E3.

2077
02:35:04,729 --> 02:35:05,269
[SPEAKER_13]: It is done.

2078
02:35:05,329 --> 02:35:06,170
[SPEAKER_13]: They have moved on.

2079
02:35:06,590 --> 02:35:10,233
[SPEAKER_13]: This is how they're getting Metal Gear Solid on the 360 is moving forward.

2080
02:35:10,473 --> 02:35:15,317
[SPEAKER_14]: There is a new Metal Gear Solid PlayStation Network and live game that's coming out.

2081
02:35:15,337 --> 02:35:16,918
[SPEAKER_14]: It's using the Metal Gear Solid 4 engine.

2082
02:35:17,299 --> 02:35:17,599
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, neat.

2083
02:35:17,699 --> 02:35:18,199
[SPEAKER_14]: What game is that?

2084
02:35:18,480 --> 02:35:20,401
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't remember what it's called, but I remember hearing about it.

2085
02:35:21,222 --> 02:35:21,302
[SPEAKER_14]: Um...

2086
02:35:22,898 --> 02:35:24,301
[SPEAKER_14]: Maybe that's that Metal Gear Solid arcade.

2087
02:35:25,464 --> 02:35:26,025
[SPEAKER_14]: Probably what that is.

2088
02:35:26,145 --> 02:35:29,392
[SPEAKER_14]: I was thinking an arcade game, but it's actually for Xbox Live Arcade.

2089
02:35:31,792 --> 02:35:32,452
[SPEAKER_14]: So that's kind of neat.

2090
02:35:34,314 --> 02:35:35,435
[SPEAKER_14]: There you go, Metal Gear Solid 4.

2091
02:35:35,475 --> 02:35:35,435
360.

2092
02:35:36,315 --> 02:35:37,596
[SPEAKER_13]: A couple other games.

2093
02:35:37,696 --> 02:35:38,537
[SPEAKER_13]: Modern Warfare 2.

2094
02:35:39,157 --> 02:35:40,838
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know if you are into this, Loki.

2095
02:35:41,699 --> 02:35:42,840
[SPEAKER_13]: No, not my thing.

2096
02:35:43,340 --> 02:35:49,824
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, again, this kind of falls in the category of, hey, it looks neat for the people that are into that sort of game, but I can't play everything.

2097
02:35:50,505 --> 02:35:51,205
[SPEAKER_13]: Alan Wake.

2098
02:35:51,305 --> 02:35:52,626
[SPEAKER_13]: Let's close with Alan Wake.

2099
02:35:52,686 --> 02:35:53,747
[SPEAKER_13]: What did you think of this one?

2100
02:35:54,848 --> 02:35:56,629
[SPEAKER_14]: It's nice to actually see the game being played.

2101
02:35:56,649 --> 02:35:57,490
[SPEAKER_14]: A little...

2102
02:35:58,010 --> 02:35:58,330
[SPEAKER_14]: Weird.

2103
02:35:58,490 --> 02:35:58,831
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know.

2104
02:35:58,851 --> 02:36:00,292
[SPEAKER_14]: The whole light-dark thing is kind of neat.

2105
02:36:01,272 --> 02:36:02,093
[SPEAKER_14]: Reminds me of that WiiWare game.

2106
02:36:02,113 --> 02:36:05,015
[SPEAKER_05]: I wanted to know about that one because I wasn't sure on it.

2107
02:36:06,176 --> 02:36:09,859
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, here's a little trailer I can actually play here, except there's a lot to this.

2108
02:36:09,879 --> 02:36:16,103
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very lengthy trailer.

2109
02:36:16,263 --> 02:36:17,885
[SPEAKER_13]: Let me see if I can skip ahead a little.

2110
02:36:19,466 --> 02:36:25,110
[SPEAKER_14]: Actually try to show some of the... Yeah, I don't like the previously on Alan Wake because it reminds me of...

2111
02:36:26,283 --> 02:36:26,823
[SPEAKER_14]: A Little in the Dark

2112
02:36:57,165 --> 02:36:59,026
[SPEAKER_05]: X-Link in chat says it looks like Silent Hill meets Supernatural.

2113
02:36:59,046 --> 02:36:59,907
[SPEAKER_05]: That would be like Jamie's dream game.

2114
02:36:59,927 --> 02:37:01,628
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that would really be my dream game.

2115
02:37:01,648 --> 02:37:04,450
[SPEAKER_05]: I think I would have to check this one out after all.

2116
02:37:22,294 --> 02:37:23,174
[SPEAKER_14]: Loki, what did you want to add?

2117
02:37:23,634 --> 02:37:26,576
[SPEAKER_14]: I was going to add there was one thing that didn't get announced.

2118
02:37:27,156 --> 02:37:29,217
[SPEAKER_14]: Actually, a few things that they announced and touched on.

2119
02:37:30,518 --> 02:37:34,820
[SPEAKER_14]: One, some new enhancements to Netflix.

2120
02:37:35,400 --> 02:37:44,245
[SPEAKER_14]: Now you're going to be able to actually add stuff to your streaming queue straight from the 360, not having to go back to your PC, which is kind of cool.

2121
02:37:45,546 --> 02:37:48,147
[SPEAKER_14]: You'll be able to also browse through different categories on there.

2122
02:37:48,187 --> 02:37:49,147
[SPEAKER_14]: They're also doing...

2123
02:37:50,268 --> 02:37:52,089
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2124
02:38:11,303 --> 02:38:19,947
[SPEAKER_14]: The Xbox video marketplace is being relaunched at the Zune video this fall to kind of integrate it with their Zune HD stuff.

2125
02:38:20,147 --> 02:38:22,107
[SPEAKER_13]: Which did not come up at the conference at all.

2126
02:38:24,168 --> 02:38:27,809
[SPEAKER_14]: And then also this one was a really big surprise.

2127
02:38:27,889 --> 02:38:29,950
[SPEAKER_14]: It didn't come up at the conference at all.

2128
02:38:31,110 --> 02:38:34,852
[SPEAKER_14]: You're going to be able to download full Xbox 360 games starting in August.

2129
02:38:36,173 --> 02:39:01,950
[SPEAKER_14]: on their service and you're going to be able to basically buy brand new games including like Mass Effect, Assassin's Creed, Civilization Revolution it's going to be you can use Microsoft points or actually use a credit card to buy these games and they're full retail games that do not require a disc at all and they will store it on your hard drive that just sounds a bit bizarre yeah kind of interesting the whole digital distribution thing huh

2130
02:39:03,129 --> 02:39:07,643
[SPEAKER_05]: Just like full... The whole damn game.

2131
02:39:07,984 --> 02:39:08,626
[SPEAKER_05]: That's pretty crazy.

2132
02:39:11,277 --> 02:39:15,839
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright, so that pretty much wraps it up for everything I wanted to say about the press conferences.

2133
02:39:17,060 --> 02:39:21,962
[SPEAKER_13]: DarkSakura, I know you had a few stories you wanted to talk about tonight that weren't really necessarily tied in completely to E3.

2134
02:39:22,062 --> 02:39:24,884
[SPEAKER_05]: But some of it was touched on a bit.

2135
02:39:24,924 --> 02:39:26,044
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me pull up.

2136
02:39:27,545 --> 02:39:32,128
[SPEAKER_13]: And then I'm going to probably just turn it back to Loki, see if there's anything else he wants to mention about E3.

2137
02:39:33,008 --> 02:39:36,670
[SPEAKER_13]: We need to cover release dates at some point too, don't we?

2138
02:39:37,410 --> 02:39:40,832
[SPEAKER_13]: So we'll cover release dates as well and get into those.

2139
02:39:41,505 --> 02:39:44,487
[SPEAKER_05]: I unfortunately accidentally closed my release date page.

2140
02:39:45,228 --> 02:39:53,193
[SPEAKER_13]: We are going to go to the Skype line tonight, but since we anticipate there's going to be a lot of calls tonight, we're going to institute our two-minute rule tonight, which means no call is going to go longer than two minutes.

2141
02:39:53,453 --> 02:39:55,275
[SPEAKER_13]: We're going to be asking everyone the same questions.

2142
02:39:55,475 --> 02:39:57,356
[SPEAKER_13]: Who are you, and what did you think of E3?

2143
02:39:57,396 --> 02:40:02,880
[SPEAKER_13]: So we'll give everyone their two minutes, but since we want to get through a lot of calls tonight, just so you know, that's going to be the rule tonight.

2144
02:40:04,261 --> 02:40:08,044
[SPEAKER_13]: I know that might be sad, but at the same time, that means we get more people on the phone, and that's happy.

2145
02:40:08,504 --> 02:40:09,185
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, there we go.

2146
02:40:09,285 --> 02:40:09,705
[SPEAKER_13]: Be happy.

2147
02:40:09,745 --> 02:40:10,286
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, DarkSakura.

2148
02:40:10,306 --> 02:40:29,906
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, what we have is, for the 10th, this is UK releases, by the way, we have Draconica on PC, and then on the 12th we have EA Sports Grand Chellum Tennis, Indiana Jones and the Staff of Kings on a bunch of systems, Prototype on PC, PS3, Xbox 360, and that's it.

2149
02:40:34,373 --> 02:40:39,295
[SPEAKER_13]: Going over to Japan, you might have heard me mention last week, there really is not a lot to look forward to in Japan this month.

2150
02:40:39,355 --> 02:40:43,476
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a very slow release over in Japan, and that continues to be true this week.

2151
02:40:43,516 --> 02:40:51,059
[SPEAKER_13]: There really isn't anything out on the Xbox 360 or the PlayStation 3, although a big game's getting a price drop next week.

2152
02:40:51,599 --> 02:40:52,859
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll have to tell you about that next week.

2153
02:40:53,179 --> 02:40:57,441
[SPEAKER_13]: But going to some of the other systems, again, going to Japan, on the PlayStation 2...

2154
02:40:58,681 --> 02:40:59,381
[SPEAKER_13]: Again, nothing.

2155
02:40:59,421 --> 02:41:01,762
[SPEAKER_13]: There is literally nothing coming out in Japan this week.

2156
02:41:01,802 --> 02:41:03,263
[SPEAKER_13]: Let me see if the DS is any different.

2157
02:41:03,643 --> 02:41:09,665
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, on the DS you get Infinite Space is a new game from Sega coming out.

2158
02:41:10,685 --> 02:41:11,546
[SPEAKER_13]: That comes out this week.

2159
02:41:11,746 --> 02:41:13,707
[SPEAKER_13]: That is really the only big release on the DS.

2160
02:41:13,727 --> 02:41:15,367
[SPEAKER_13]: That's a new Platinum Games game.

2161
02:41:16,167 --> 02:41:16,608
[SPEAKER_13]: Is it really?

2162
02:41:16,788 --> 02:41:18,228
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

2163
02:41:18,288 --> 02:41:20,469
[SPEAKER_13]: Trying to see if there's anything on the Wii to mention this week.

2164
02:41:21,571 --> 02:41:38,202
[SPEAKER_13]: Chibi-Robo, the Wii version comes out in Japan this week as well as Metroid Prime 2 with Wii controls but of course as you know it's coming out here in the US pretty soon as a combined one and then quickly looking at the PSP for Japanese release dates I really don't think

2165
02:41:39,244 --> 02:41:40,744
[SPEAKER_13]: There's anything this week either.

2166
02:41:40,824 --> 02:41:41,685
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh no, I take that back.

2167
02:41:41,745 --> 02:41:44,346
[SPEAKER_13]: Of course there is another Neon Genesis Evangelion game.

2168
02:41:45,166 --> 02:41:48,067
[SPEAKER_13]: Kotsetsu no Girlfriend 2nd Portable Limited Edition.

2169
02:41:48,127 --> 02:41:52,728
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, they're doing... I've played that game too.

2170
02:41:53,088 --> 02:41:54,849
[SPEAKER_05]: The Girlfriend of Steel.

2171
02:41:56,189 --> 02:42:01,191
[SPEAKER_13]: Fate Unlimited Codes Portable is now coming to the PSP in Japan this week.

2172
02:42:01,231 --> 02:42:03,491
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a PS2 game that's been ported.

2173
02:42:04,071 --> 02:42:05,552
[SPEAKER_13]: A 3D fight for the Holy Grail.

2174
02:42:06,598 --> 02:42:07,838
[SPEAKER_13]: That's it for Japanese releases.

2175
02:42:08,319 --> 02:42:08,919
[SPEAKER_14]: In the U.S.

2176
02:42:08,939 --> 02:42:13,601
[SPEAKER_14]: there wasn't a whole lot this coming week here, but today we had Legendary Starfy.

2177
02:42:14,081 --> 02:42:19,643
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a 2D platforming franchise from Nintendo that's finally made its way over to the United States.

2178
02:42:20,903 --> 02:42:26,806
[SPEAKER_14]: Also, next week we'll be getting Tiger Woods PGA Tour 2010 on all platforms.

2179
02:42:27,106 --> 02:42:32,368
[SPEAKER_14]: A lot more games you're going to see coming out supporting Wii Motion Plus since that's also coming out on the 9th.

2180
02:42:34,310 --> 02:42:44,263
[SPEAKER_14]: including EA's Grand Slam Tennis of course there's also the Tiger Woods PGA Tour Wii Bundle with Wii Motion Plus and then finally also coming out that

2181
02:42:45,469 --> 02:42:47,210
[SPEAKER_14]: I think there was one other Wii Motion Plus game.

2182
02:42:47,270 --> 02:42:47,551
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh yes!

2183
02:42:48,051 --> 02:42:52,455
[SPEAKER_14]: Virtua Tennis 2009 on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and the Wii.

2184
02:42:53,235 --> 02:42:55,918
[SPEAKER_14]: And then other games other than Wii Motion Plus stuff.

2185
02:42:56,618 --> 02:43:00,461
[SPEAKER_14]: Prototype coming out on PS3 and Xbox 360 and I believe PC.

2186
02:43:01,883 --> 02:43:06,586
[SPEAKER_14]: And also we've got some really crappy games.

2187
02:43:07,347 --> 02:43:11,991
[SPEAKER_14]: Diva Girls, Divas on Ice on the DS.

2188
02:43:12,711 --> 02:43:13,612
[SPEAKER_14]: And I think on the Wii.

2189
02:43:14,333 --> 02:43:14,453
[SPEAKER_14]: Um...

2190
02:43:15,700 --> 02:43:21,627
[SPEAKER_14]: Indiana Jones and the Staff of Kings on PlayStation 2, the Wii, the PSP, and I believe the DS.

2191
02:43:22,648 --> 02:43:23,829
[SPEAKER_14]: Vertigo, which is a...

2192
02:43:25,573 --> 02:43:54,041
[SPEAKER_14]: Marble Blast type of game that's going to be coming out on the Wii it's a budget title also this week Rock Band Unplugged coming out on PSP and also the bundle to go along with that and back to crappy games Pets Fashion Dogs and Cats yes a game where you can dress up both dogs and cats to look absolutely ridiculous and on the Wii we have Go Play Lumberjacks Lumberjack themed games and Go Play Circus Star I'm a lumberjack and I don't care

2193
02:43:54,601 --> 02:44:23,096
[SPEAKER_14]: seriously and then let's see here oh and then how could I forget Guitar Hero On Tour Modern Hits the third DS game not supporting the DSi Pool Hall Pro another budget Wii billiards game and then finally on the DS Lego Battles the real time strategy game for DS alright sounds fascinating

2194
02:44:24,927 --> 02:44:27,148
[SPEAKER_13]: DarkSakura, I don't know if you had anything else you wanted to mention.

2195
02:44:28,369 --> 02:44:29,349
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, yes, I did.

2196
02:44:29,530 --> 02:44:30,710
[SPEAKER_05]: Because it's about Tekken.

2197
02:44:31,111 --> 02:44:31,451
[SPEAKER_13]: Go for it.

2198
02:44:31,551 --> 02:44:32,751
[SPEAKER_05]: And I love Tekken.

2199
02:44:32,832 --> 02:44:35,353
[SPEAKER_13]: And Loki, we'll go to you with any other E3 things you want to report on.

2200
02:44:35,913 --> 02:44:37,714
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, it's just a report from E3 about Tekken 6.

2201
02:44:37,875 --> 02:44:39,856
[SPEAKER_05]: It has a beat-em-up mode.

2202
02:44:40,596 --> 02:44:42,237
[SPEAKER_05]: You can go around beating stuff up.

2203
02:44:42,958 --> 02:44:46,620
[SPEAKER_05]: Stomp them, smash them, and it has a story with it.

2204
02:44:46,640 --> 02:44:48,381
[SPEAKER_05]: And you can use guns and have giant robots.

2205
02:44:49,926 --> 02:44:50,946
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, hooray for giant robots.

2206
02:44:50,986 --> 02:44:53,987
[SPEAKER_13]: Is that like the whole Tekken 3 had its beat-em-up mode in it?

2207
02:44:54,027 --> 02:44:56,088
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what I think.

2208
02:44:58,288 --> 02:45:00,149
[SPEAKER_05]: But I mean, I think it's going to be fun.

2209
02:45:00,189 --> 02:45:02,150
[SPEAKER_05]: At least it's not like the crazy RPG mode.

2210
02:45:03,390 --> 02:45:03,650
[SPEAKER_13]: True.

2211
02:45:05,531 --> 02:45:06,891
[SPEAKER_05]: I love me some Tekken.

2212
02:45:10,068 --> 02:45:13,529
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, and some other things that were kind of E3 related.

2213
02:45:14,110 --> 02:45:19,932
[SPEAKER_14]: Another part of the Microsoft press conference that they talked about, the new game from Big Park, Joyride.

2214
02:45:20,012 --> 02:45:22,634
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a free-to-download kart racing game.

2215
02:45:23,442 --> 02:45:24,263
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you for watching!

2216
02:45:44,438 --> 02:45:51,280
[SPEAKER_14]: In fact, to kind of go along with all that stuff, Microsoft has announced their new Summer of Arcade.

2217
02:45:51,920 --> 02:45:59,522
[SPEAKER_14]: And with that, a bunch of games coming out, including Splosion Man, which I believe they had a trailer for a while ago, which looked kind of cool.

2218
02:45:59,922 --> 02:46:02,563
[SPEAKER_14]: The game from Epic Shadow Complex.

2219
02:46:03,563 --> 02:46:07,304
[SPEAKER_14]: TMNT, Turtles in Time, reshelled, the remake of Turtles in Time.

2220
02:46:07,424 --> 02:46:08,685
[SPEAKER_04]: That's happy, happy, happy.

2221
02:46:08,705 --> 02:46:09,085
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, please.

2222
02:46:10,155 --> 02:46:14,338
[SPEAKER_14]: The HD port of Marvel vs. Capcom 2 coming.

2223
02:46:15,238 --> 02:46:22,702
[SPEAKER_14]: Trials HD, which is based off of a Steam game, Trials 2, second edition, that's going to be coming out.

2224
02:46:23,223 --> 02:46:28,566
[SPEAKER_14]: And also, to go along with the more telltale games, adventure games...

2225
02:46:29,526 --> 02:46:35,312
[SPEAKER_14]: Monkey Island Special Edition, coming out with both remixed and original graphics.

2226
02:46:35,672 --> 02:46:37,954
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, that was a huge thing announced at E3.

2227
02:46:38,094 --> 02:46:40,597
[SPEAKER_05]: Who played Monkey Island?

2228
02:46:41,257 --> 02:46:41,958
[SPEAKER_13]: I played Monkey Island.

2229
02:46:41,978 --> 02:46:46,402
[SPEAKER_13]: That was a huge PC game, the LucasArts series.

2230
02:46:46,622 --> 02:46:51,407
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I mean, I just wanted to know if either of you guys actually played it, because I actually didn't.

2231
02:46:52,105 --> 02:46:56,087
[SPEAKER_13]: I didn't play that one, but I played Loom and some of the other ones that LucasArts... Well, Loom.

2232
02:46:56,167 --> 02:46:56,728
[SPEAKER_05]: Hell yeah.

2233
02:46:56,808 --> 02:46:57,488
[SPEAKER_05]: I love Loom.

2234
02:46:58,008 --> 02:47:00,170
[SPEAKER_14]: I love me some Monkey Island there.

2235
02:47:00,410 --> 02:47:10,836
[SPEAKER_14]: And I also... Something else that made me kind of happy is not only are they releasing the original Monkey Island and the remixed version, but Telltale is working on

2236
02:47:11,616 --> 02:47:12,176
[SPEAKER_14]: and DarkSakura.

2237
02:47:37,295 --> 02:47:39,837
[SPEAKER_14]: Avatar's are going to get some interesting stuff.

2238
02:47:40,117 --> 02:47:45,621
[SPEAKER_14]: You're going to be able to get unlockable clothing and props for Avatar's based on achievements.

2239
02:47:46,141 --> 02:47:50,245
[SPEAKER_14]: And they're showing off some of the ones for ODST which unlocks a costume for your character.

2240
02:47:50,785 --> 02:47:53,527
[SPEAKER_14]: So that's kind of cool that they're utilizing them in that sense.

2241
02:47:54,908 --> 02:47:55,569
[SPEAKER_14]: That's kind of cool.

2242
02:47:56,569 --> 02:47:58,231
[SPEAKER_13]: And yet still no trophy cabinets in Home.

2243
02:47:58,271 --> 02:48:04,535
[SPEAKER_13]: Although I will say I did play Home this week and they are slowly making upgrades to what we all thought Home was going to be a year ago.

2244
02:48:04,796 --> 02:48:05,056
[SPEAKER_05]: Really?

2245
02:48:05,076 --> 02:48:05,156
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

2246
02:48:05,970 --> 02:48:07,750
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, you can finally put pictures in home.

2247
02:48:07,910 --> 02:48:09,351
[SPEAKER_13]: You can import pictures into your home.

2248
02:48:09,391 --> 02:48:10,431
[SPEAKER_05]: That's special.

2249
02:48:11,471 --> 02:48:11,791
[SPEAKER_05]: Something.

2250
02:48:11,991 --> 02:48:12,872
[SPEAKER_14]: Some other stuff.

2251
02:48:13,112 --> 02:48:14,352
[SPEAKER_14]: Going back to Microsoft again.

2252
02:48:15,512 --> 02:48:19,773
[SPEAKER_14]: Some features they were talking about when they originally were showing off the new Xbox experience.

2253
02:48:20,213 --> 02:48:25,275
[SPEAKER_14]: Now you will be able to watch movies with your friends and also do the photo slideshows and stuff like that with your friends.

2254
02:48:25,295 --> 02:48:27,295
[SPEAKER_14]: I think you can actually already do the photo slideshows now.

2255
02:48:27,695 --> 02:48:29,876
[SPEAKER_14]: But you'll be able to listen to music and stuff with your friends.

2256
02:48:29,976 --> 02:48:30,136
[SPEAKER_14]: So...

2257
02:48:31,016 --> 02:48:31,757
[SPEAKER_14]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

2258
02:48:46,580 --> 02:48:47,360
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's see here.

2259
02:48:48,121 --> 02:48:50,341
[SPEAKER_14]: Also, some other random stuff.

2260
02:48:50,981 --> 02:48:57,563
[SPEAKER_14]: Xbox Live Arcade on June 17th will be getting Magic the Gathering as their downloadable title.

2261
02:48:57,683 --> 02:49:03,105
[SPEAKER_14]: Magic the Gathering, Duels of Planeswalker will be coming out.

2262
02:49:03,965 --> 02:49:07,366
[SPEAKER_14]: So if you're a Magic fan, that's probably pretty exciting news.

2263
02:49:09,126 --> 02:49:18,189
[SPEAKER_14]: On the Wii, actually, WiiWare in Japan is getting a new four-player Pokemon fighting game that's coming out on June 16th.

2264
02:49:19,469 --> 02:49:27,332
[SPEAKER_14]: No word on exactly how that's going to play, but it looks like gameplay is real-time like Zelda or Ys-type action RPG.

2265
02:49:28,092 --> 02:49:32,293
[SPEAKER_14]: And, of course, four players can face off in the game's Battle Royale Arena mode.

2266
02:49:32,973 --> 02:49:33,153
[SPEAKER_06]: Huh.

2267
02:49:33,773 --> 02:49:34,274
[SPEAKER_14]: Interesting.

2268
02:49:34,294 --> 02:49:34,334
[SPEAKER_14]: Um...

2269
02:49:37,199 --> 02:49:38,219
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's see here.

2270
02:49:39,300 --> 02:49:40,040
[SPEAKER_14]: Team Ico.

2271
02:49:40,120 --> 02:49:49,844
[SPEAKER_14]: Remember, I think we talked a little bit last week that they were teasing that there's going to be some Ico download content for LittleBigPlanet.

2272
02:49:49,864 --> 02:49:50,725
[SPEAKER_14]: Did they say what it is?

2273
02:49:52,946 --> 02:50:05,491
[SPEAKER_14]: Actually, they have some more teaser stuff that go along with it, but apparently it looks like it might actually be a level pack like the Metal Gear Solid stuff.

2274
02:50:06,545 --> 02:50:06,946
[SPEAKER_13]: Sweet!

2275
02:50:07,126 --> 02:50:08,587
[SPEAKER_13]: I love the Metal Gear Solid level pack.

2276
02:50:08,867 --> 02:50:11,750
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, so they have some stuff from Media Molecule.

2277
02:50:11,850 --> 02:50:13,832
[SPEAKER_14]: It's on their website.

2278
02:50:15,474 --> 02:50:20,479
[SPEAKER_14]: Doesn't really show... It says it's Shadow Colossus stuff, I guess, is what it's supposed to be.

2279
02:50:22,141 --> 02:50:24,683
[SPEAKER_14]: They don't really... It's just like kind of teaser stuff right now.

2280
02:50:25,644 --> 02:50:28,207
[SPEAKER_14]: Trying to pull up their video, see if it actually shows...

2281
02:50:32,375 --> 02:50:35,396
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know, but it looks like it's just going to be Shadow of the Colossus stuff.

2282
02:50:35,756 --> 02:50:41,098
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know if it's actual levels or stuff, but it's at least going to be stickers and costumes.

2283
02:50:41,918 --> 02:50:42,638
[SPEAKER_14]: So that's kind of neat.

2284
02:50:43,359 --> 02:50:47,300
[SPEAKER_14]: And they have like a Colossus costume and stuff.

2285
02:50:47,860 --> 02:50:56,063
[SPEAKER_14]: Tatsunoko vs. Capcom was shown at E3 this year, and they've announced that there's going to be five new characters for North America since they've removed one.

2286
02:50:56,363 --> 02:50:58,023
[SPEAKER_05]: And they're taking out the Genie character.

2287
02:50:58,623 --> 02:51:00,244
[SPEAKER_14]: So that'll be kind of cool.

2288
02:51:01,803 --> 02:51:05,085
[SPEAKER_14]: Perfect Dark being remade for Xbox Live Arcade.

2289
02:51:05,125 --> 02:51:08,666
[SPEAKER_14]: We kind of knew that because of all the leaked icons and images and stuff like that.

2290
02:51:09,067 --> 02:51:10,187
[SPEAKER_14]: But it has been confirmed now.

2291
02:51:10,307 --> 02:51:16,850
[SPEAKER_14]: It's actually being redone or kind of updated, I guess, to run in 1080p.

2292
02:51:17,090 --> 02:51:19,752
[SPEAKER_14]: It'll be coming out this fall on Xbox Live Arcade.

2293
02:51:23,653 --> 02:51:24,514
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's see here.

2294
02:51:27,256 --> 02:51:28,076
[SPEAKER_14]: Some other stuff.

2295
02:51:28,336 --> 02:51:30,637
[SPEAKER_14]: They were showing off this game called Cop.

2296
02:51:31,237 --> 02:51:34,258
[SPEAKER_14]: The recruit for the DS actually looked pretty cool.

2297
02:51:34,278 --> 02:51:37,219
[SPEAKER_14]: It actually looked like kind of the PSP Grand Theft Auto games.

2298
02:51:37,619 --> 02:51:41,260
[SPEAKER_14]: That's coming out from Ubisoft I think later this year.

2299
02:51:42,020 --> 02:51:42,900
[SPEAKER_14]: So that looked kind of cool.

2300
02:51:45,341 --> 02:51:45,441
[SPEAKER_14]: Um...

2301
02:51:48,934 --> 02:51:50,335
[SPEAKER_13]: Why don't we take some calls real quick?

2302
02:51:50,355 --> 02:51:50,435
[SPEAKER_13]: Sure.

2303
02:51:50,455 --> 02:51:53,896
[SPEAKER_13]: We're going to open up the Skype line because, yeah, we're already running into about three hours worth of show.

2304
02:51:53,916 --> 02:51:56,717
[SPEAKER_13]: It's about 9.30 here on the West Coast, very late on the East Coast.

2305
02:51:56,837 --> 02:52:01,719
[SPEAKER_13]: So I'm going to go ahead and open up the Skype line tonight, try to get some calls out of the way, and then we'll see if Loki has anything else he wants to bring up.

2306
02:52:02,119 --> 02:52:08,442
[SPEAKER_13]: Again, if you guys want to share your E3 stories so we can wrap up and get out of here tonight, try to get done before 10 o'clock tonight.

2307
02:52:09,082 --> 02:52:09,902
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, come on.

2308
02:52:10,442 --> 02:52:12,923
[SPEAKER_13]: I know, but I kind of have to work really early tomorrow.

2309
02:52:12,963 --> 02:52:14,184
[SPEAKER_13]: So we're going to start taking some calls.

2310
02:52:14,204 --> 02:52:15,584
[SPEAKER_13]: Remember, two-minute rules in effect tonight.

2311
02:52:16,064 --> 02:52:16,985
[SPEAKER_13]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

2312
02:52:17,005 --> 02:52:17,365
[SPEAKER_13]: Who's this?

2313
02:52:18,820 --> 02:52:20,200
[SPEAKER_11]: Hey, this is DSMaster26.

2314
02:52:20,800 --> 02:52:23,061
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm sorry, was that DSMaster26?

2315
02:52:24,081 --> 02:52:24,361
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

2316
02:52:24,681 --> 02:52:25,561
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright, what's on your mind?

2317
02:52:25,601 --> 02:52:27,742
[SPEAKER_13]: Tell us about your E3 thoughts.

2318
02:52:28,822 --> 02:52:33,363
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I watched it online, and of course I also watched the Sony conference.

2319
02:52:33,843 --> 02:52:38,244
[SPEAKER_11]: The Microsoft and Nintendo ones blew me away, but Sony?

2320
02:52:39,144 --> 02:52:39,724
[SPEAKER_11]: Boring.

2321
02:52:41,905 --> 02:52:48,506
[SPEAKER_11]: The biggest disappointment was, okay, you know how they had Chewbacca come out with the PSP 2000 Star Wars pack, right?

2322
02:52:49,099 --> 02:52:57,741
[SPEAKER_11]: I can't believe how they did not schedule Miley Cyrus aka Hannah Montana to bring out the Hannah bundle.

2323
02:52:58,181 --> 02:53:00,682
[SPEAKER_13]: Seeing as that it got such a huge reception, yeah.

2324
02:53:00,722 --> 02:53:07,403
[SPEAKER_13]: But what was it that impressed you more with Microsoft and Nintendo that Sony wasn't delivering on?

2325
02:53:08,683 --> 02:53:14,404
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, they showed actual gameplay for Final Fantasy XIII.

2326
02:53:14,985 --> 02:53:16,905
[SPEAKER_11]: They showed off, you know,

2327
02:53:17,520 --> 02:53:21,003
[SPEAKER_11]: A few songs from Beatles Rock Band, which that was actually kind of awesome.

2328
02:53:22,164 --> 02:53:30,330
[SPEAKER_11]: And the Nintendo conference was actually really kind of cool when they showed off the other M, Metroid.

2329
02:53:31,230 --> 02:53:33,172
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm like, this is freaking awesome.

2330
02:53:33,372 --> 02:53:36,154
[SPEAKER_13]: Was there more than just the Metroid that you enjoyed at a Nintendo's press conference?

2331
02:53:37,735 --> 02:53:43,360
[SPEAKER_11]: That was pretty much, well, other than the Resident Evil stuff, but, well, yeah, and Cop.

2332
02:53:44,300 --> 02:53:46,302
[SPEAKER_11]: Because I'm like, come on.

2333
02:53:46,892 --> 02:53:56,322
[SPEAKER_11]: Rockstar, if Ubisoft can pull off full 3D sandbox game for DS that's similar to GTA, why can't you?

2334
02:53:58,044 --> 02:53:59,105
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright, 20 seconds left.

2335
02:53:59,145 --> 02:54:01,027
[SPEAKER_13]: Any other thoughts about E3 you want to share?

2336
02:54:02,488 --> 02:54:07,013
[SPEAKER_11]: Basically, when I was talking about before my PSP went wonky...

2337
02:54:08,653 --> 02:54:15,136
[SPEAKER_11]: If Rock Band's dealing with Lego, I'm betting you full on, somewhere down the line, Guitar Hero's going to pick up on Disney.

2338
02:54:15,597 --> 02:54:16,877
[SPEAKER_11]: It's bound to happen.

2339
02:54:17,398 --> 02:54:18,198
[SPEAKER_13]: We'll see what happens.

2340
02:54:18,258 --> 02:54:18,898
[SPEAKER_13]: All right, time's up.

2341
02:54:19,119 --> 02:54:19,759
[SPEAKER_13]: Batav, good one.

2342
02:54:19,779 --> 02:54:20,439
[SPEAKER_13]: Thanks for calling in.

2343
02:54:22,000 --> 02:54:24,301
[SPEAKER_13]: All right, peace out.

2344
02:54:24,321 --> 02:54:24,561
[SPEAKER_13]: Later.

02:54:32,606 --> 02:54:34,427
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, long time no see, Foodie Monster.

[SPEAKER_08]: I'm doing fine.

2355
02:54:36,732 --> 02:54:41,577
[SPEAKER_08]: I've actually moved countries, which is why I've been kind of able or something, MIA and stuff.

2356
02:54:41,777 --> 02:54:42,358
[SPEAKER_13]: Where are you now?

[SPEAKER_08]: Let's see.

02:54:53,329 --> 02:54:57,454
[SPEAKER_08]: Splinter Cell Conviction, oh my god, that looked incredible, and I'm so happy with the direction they're taking that game.

2363
02:54:58,596 --> 02:55:18,753

2364

[SPEAKER_08]: They're showing more stuff, more games, Little Planet, a lot of things, RPGs, and I'm really excited about that Definitely interested about The Last Guardian, that might actually get me to buy a PS3 because that looks great And definitely my best of E3 thing, the best thing that happened in E3 Secret of Monkey Island Special Edition and Telltale's version of Tales from Monkey Island which is going to be the best thing since sliced bread

[SPEAKER_13]: Hey, Spazinator.

2381
02:56:37,201 --> 02:56:37,881
[SPEAKER_13]: You got two minutes.

2382
02:56:38,081 --> 02:56:38,582
[SPEAKER_13]: Three thoughts.

2383
02:56:38,642 --> 02:56:38,762
[SPEAKER_13]: Go.

2384
02:56:40,573 --> 02:56:46,734
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I was impressed by both Microsoft and Sony's conferences.

2385
02:56:48,195 --> 02:56:58,897
[SPEAKER_10]: There's too much stuff to really list out, but both the NATO and the Sony motion controller do look promising.

2386
02:56:58,977 --> 02:57:02,118
[SPEAKER_10]: I can't see whether they're going to be good or not.

2387
02:57:02,778 --> 02:57:07,519
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm also kind of excited about the Final Fantasy release stuff, too.

2388
02:57:09,886 --> 02:57:16,668
[SPEAKER_13]: What do you think, since you're really excited about the motion control, how do you think Nintendo can catch up, or do they need to?

2389
02:57:19,909 --> 02:57:22,029
[SPEAKER_10]: I honestly don't know.

2390
02:57:22,769 --> 02:57:33,692
[SPEAKER_10]: I really haven't been following Nintendo at all for the past 10 years.

2391
02:57:34,472 --> 02:57:38,753
[SPEAKER_10]: I really don't know enough about the Wii to really comment on that.

2392
02:57:40,404 --> 02:57:42,786
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, is there any other E3 thoughts you want to comment on tonight, then?

2393
02:57:44,247 --> 02:57:45,548
[SPEAKER_10]: No, that's it.

2394
02:57:46,189 --> 02:57:47,229
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks for taking my call.

2395
02:57:47,450 --> 02:57:48,130
[SPEAKER_13]: Not a problem.

2396
02:57:48,190 --> 02:57:48,931
[SPEAKER_13]: Take care, Spazinator.

2397
02:57:48,951 --> 02:57:49,351
[SPEAKER_13]: Have a good one.

2398
02:57:50,592 --> 02:57:51,132
[SPEAKER_10]: Yep, you too.

2399
02:57:51,513 --> 02:57:52,574
[SPEAKER_13]: Later.

2400
02:57:52,594 --> 02:57:53,975
[SPEAKER_13]: 1-877-GAME-OLR.

2401
02:57:54,095 --> 02:57:56,577
[SPEAKER_13]: Our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

2402
02:57:56,617 --> 02:58:07,245
[SPEAKER_13]: If you want to give us a call, please make sure if you do use Skype, you want to test with Echo 123 first before you call, or else your call might sound like crap, and we don't want to have that now, do we?

2403
02:58:08,026 --> 02:58:09,047
[SPEAKER_13]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

2404
02:58:09,067 --> 02:58:09,407
[SPEAKER_13]: Who's this?

2405
02:58:10,353 --> 02:58:13,274
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, it's me, Legend of Zaku.

2406
02:58:13,394 --> 02:58:14,974
[SPEAKER_13]: Hey, Legend of Zaku.

2407
02:58:15,155 --> 02:58:15,655
[SPEAKER_13]: Two minutes.

2408
02:58:15,855 --> 02:58:16,715
[SPEAKER_13]: What did you think of E3?

2409
02:58:18,396 --> 02:58:18,996
[SPEAKER_07]: Pretty much.

2410
02:58:19,996 --> 02:58:28,099
[SPEAKER_07]: Initially, it looks like Microsoft took it, but then again, Sony actually came out and tried very, very close to top them.

2411
02:58:28,359 --> 02:58:32,060
[SPEAKER_07]: But Nintendo pretty much came in third.

2412
02:58:33,900 --> 02:58:38,822
[SPEAKER_07]: At least it was better than last year's Nintendo Presser, since that was a downer at best.

2413
02:58:40,003 --> 02:58:40,804
[SPEAKER_07]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

2414
02:59:10,436 --> 02:59:21,520
[SPEAKER_07]: Anything that they may have not thought of into the development process, well, they still can because they still got, like, what, at least less than a year before they even release it.

2415
02:59:22,941 --> 02:59:26,662
[SPEAKER_07]: So they should have plenty of time to work out any final kicks before they market this thing.

2416
02:59:27,262 --> 02:59:30,724
[SPEAKER_13]: No one's answered this question yet, and you've got about 40 seconds left.

2417
02:59:30,804 --> 02:59:34,245
[SPEAKER_13]: Who do you think is going to be the first one out there, Microsoft or Sony?

2418
02:59:35,770 --> 02:59:38,871
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, and this is the issue with First to Market.

2419
02:59:40,052 --> 02:59:44,113
[SPEAKER_07]: It all depends on whether Sony can get it, can outdo Microsoft.

2420
02:59:44,153 --> 02:59:50,135
[SPEAKER_07]: In other words, if Natal is going to get sidelined and delayed, then that works in Sony's favor.

2421
02:59:51,296 --> 02:59:59,359
[SPEAKER_07]: And then we'll see that Natal is nothing more than a crock of hyped up shit.

2422
03:00:00,619 --> 03:00:03,000
[SPEAKER_13]: Quickly, do you think anyone might rush this and screw up?

2423
03:00:04,338 --> 03:00:05,200
[SPEAKER_07]: It depends.

2424
03:00:05,460 --> 03:00:11,874
[SPEAKER_07]: I think Sony has done a lot to the point where they could rush this, but they should have a decent product.

2425
03:00:12,996 --> 03:00:14,860
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm more worried about Microsoft.

2426
03:00:17,513 --> 03:00:19,913
[SPEAKER_07]: We haven't even seen the real thing.

2427
03:00:19,933 --> 03:00:23,014
[SPEAKER_07]: We haven't seen the real unit on E3.

2428
03:00:23,074 --> 03:00:29,996
[SPEAKER_07]: We only saw pictures of it and trailers and demos that didn't even use the unit itself.

2429
03:00:30,376 --> 03:00:30,876
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright, buddy.

2430
03:00:30,896 --> 03:00:31,596
[SPEAKER_13]: I've got to let you go.

2431
03:00:31,676 --> 03:00:32,076
[SPEAKER_13]: Time's up.

2432
03:00:32,176 --> 03:00:33,117
[SPEAKER_13]: Thanks for sharing your thoughts.

2433
03:00:33,237 --> 03:00:33,677
[SPEAKER_13]: Have a good one.

2434
03:00:33,857 --> 03:00:34,057
[SPEAKER_13]: Later.

2435
03:00:34,117 --> 03:00:35,937
[SPEAKER_13]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

2436
03:00:35,957 --> 03:00:36,678
[SPEAKER_13]: Who's this?

2437
03:00:36,698 --> 03:00:37,198
[SPEAKER_13]: Hi, it's SSJ100 Matt.

2438
03:00:37,218 --> 03:00:37,698
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, hello SSJ100 Matt.

2439
03:00:37,758 --> 03:00:38,058
[SPEAKER_13]: Two minutes.

2440
03:00:38,078 --> 03:00:38,278
[SPEAKER_13]: Ready?

2441
03:00:38,298 --> 03:00:38,338
[SPEAKER_13]: Go!

2442
03:00:48,118 --> 03:00:49,899
[SPEAKER_01]: E3 overall, I enjoyed it quite a bit.

2443
03:00:50,859 --> 03:00:53,680
[SPEAKER_01]: I enjoyed Sony's conference the most.

2444
03:00:54,080 --> 03:01:02,144
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, not really the most, but I enjoyed the, you know, Last Guardian, which actually made me cum a little, not going to lie.

2445
03:01:04,805 --> 03:01:05,746
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for your honesty.

2446
03:01:06,026 --> 03:01:07,627
[SPEAKER_05]: We're listening to KTMI.

2447
03:01:09,487 --> 03:01:14,390
[SPEAKER_01]: And I like Mag, and then I could...

2448
03:01:15,520 --> 03:01:16,680
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all I could think of at the time.

2449
03:01:16,740 --> 03:01:19,622
[SPEAKER_01]: But the thing I wanted to call in about was Natal.

2450
03:01:21,782 --> 03:01:23,003
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I mentioned this on Twitter.

2451
03:01:23,503 --> 03:01:25,704
[SPEAKER_01]: I 100% agree with you.

2452
03:01:27,065 --> 03:01:28,665
[SPEAKER_01]: We should be skeptical of this thing.

2453
03:01:29,185 --> 03:01:32,146
[SPEAKER_01]: Because they talk pretty big with tech demo videos.

2454
03:01:33,567 --> 03:01:38,449
[SPEAKER_01]: But until we get something tangible, because they didn't really show us anything hands-on.

2455
03:01:40,850 --> 03:01:58,347
[SPEAKER_01]: I would like to see what the third party developers are going to do with this and whether or not they can pull something off quick enough that's

2456
03:02:02,320 --> 03:02:05,302
[SPEAKER_13]: Now that they have their development kits, which apparently they just got.

2457
03:02:05,382 --> 03:02:07,164
[SPEAKER_13]: So that's why I think this thing still weighs out.

2458
03:02:07,224 --> 03:02:11,567
[SPEAKER_13]: But quickly, since you don't have a lot of time left, any other thoughts you wanted to share, SSJ?

2459
03:02:14,109 --> 03:02:17,511
[SPEAKER_01]: Two things I was kind of disappointed that weren't at E3.

2460
03:02:18,852 --> 03:02:24,557
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm disappointed that Microsoft didn't mention anything about X and A, what they plan on doing with that.

2461
03:02:25,157 --> 03:02:26,318
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, that's a damn good point.

2462
03:02:26,738 --> 03:02:27,119
[SPEAKER_13]: You're right.

2463
03:02:27,139 --> 03:02:28,180
[SPEAKER_13]: There wasn't anything on that.

2464
03:02:28,280 --> 03:02:28,520
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

2465
03:02:29,172 --> 03:02:36,237
[SPEAKER_01]: Because they didn't mention anything about it, and you know... Ah, they're going to kick it to the curb and treat it like the bastard child it is.

2466
03:02:36,277 --> 03:02:36,958
[SPEAKER_13]: What's the other thing?

2467
03:02:37,999 --> 03:02:42,782
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was wondering, where's Final Fantasy XIII Versus?

2468
03:02:43,703 --> 03:02:44,423
[SPEAKER_13]: Good question!

2469
03:02:45,324 --> 03:02:46,185
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, nowhere to be seen.

2470
03:02:46,685 --> 03:02:47,546
[SPEAKER_13]: 2011, if we're lucky.

2471
03:02:47,886 --> 03:02:50,428
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright, SJ100Mal, we've got to let you go, but thanks for your thoughts.

2472
03:02:51,260 --> 03:02:52,161
[SPEAKER_13]: Yep, Boba Fett.

2473
03:03:20,868 --> 03:03:23,912
[SPEAKER_13]: The Microsoft seems to be closed down a little more to the community.

2474
03:03:24,332 --> 03:03:24,633
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know.

2475
03:03:24,713 --> 03:03:25,193
[SPEAKER_13]: Coincidence?

2476
03:03:25,654 --> 03:03:30,159
[SPEAKER_14]: I was looking at... They have a really close-up picture of the Natal camera.

2477
03:03:30,780 --> 03:03:32,282
[SPEAKER_14]: And it looks like it's got two...

2478
03:03:33,689 --> 03:03:37,132
[SPEAKER_14]: Sensors on it or two actual cameras on it.

2479
03:03:37,452 --> 03:03:42,195
[SPEAKER_14]: Almost like I think they're going to detect depth the same way as a human would detect depth.

2480
03:03:42,876 --> 03:03:46,679
[SPEAKER_14]: With the differences between the two images and figuring out where you are based on that.

2481
03:03:46,739 --> 03:03:48,140
[SPEAKER_13]: I think that's exactly what they're doing.

2482
03:03:48,220 --> 03:03:49,561
[SPEAKER_13]: I think you're right on track.

2483
03:03:49,581 --> 03:03:52,243
[SPEAKER_13]: I think it's like those stereo images where you stare at it.

2484
03:03:53,284 --> 03:03:56,426
[SPEAKER_13]: You know where the two dots come together and you're supposed to see the sail ship and all that?

2485
03:03:57,247 --> 03:03:58,528
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you going to be able to see the sailboat?

2486
03:03:59,008 --> 03:03:59,328
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know.

2487
03:03:59,369 --> 03:03:59,689
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll try.

2488
03:03:59,749 --> 03:04:00,690
[SPEAKER_13]: Let's do one more call, guys.

2489
03:04:01,090 --> 03:04:01,950
[SPEAKER_13]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

2490
03:04:01,970 --> 03:04:02,271
[SPEAKER_13]: Who's this?

2491
03:04:03,971 --> 03:04:04,652
[SPEAKER_13]: Hello?

2492
03:04:05,212 --> 03:04:06,314
[SPEAKER_13]: Hello, who's this?

2493
03:04:07,415 --> 03:04:08,857
[SPEAKER_13]: This is Marissa.

2494
03:04:09,237 --> 03:04:11,159
[SPEAKER_13]: Hi Marissa, how are you my friend?

2495
03:04:13,242 --> 03:04:14,163
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm alright, how are you?

2496
03:04:14,203 --> 03:04:19,429
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry, I just had to leave the house for all of these sounds of Call of Duty right now.

2497
03:04:19,969 --> 03:04:24,535
[SPEAKER_13]: Well awesome, we're talking about E3 but you've only got two minutes hun, so what's on your mind?

2498
03:04:26,054 --> 03:04:31,520
[SPEAKER_03]: I just called to say hello, and the biggest disappointment of E3 was that you did not call me.

2499
03:04:32,401 --> 03:04:34,523
[SPEAKER_13]: I know, I'm so sorry, Marissa.

2500
03:04:34,583 --> 03:04:35,704
[SPEAKER_13]: I got so busy down there.

2501
03:04:35,724 --> 03:04:40,308
[SPEAKER_13]: It was my first trip with my boyfriend and everything, who's from L.A., and we had all this other stuff planned.

2502
03:04:40,528 --> 03:04:41,249
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just teasing you.

2503
03:04:41,309 --> 03:04:46,754
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, the only relevant gamer news to me is that I just found out they're coming out with a C4.

2504
03:04:46,795 --> 03:04:47,956
[SPEAKER_03]: It's completely irrelevant.

2505
03:04:49,321 --> 03:04:56,624
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, we will definitely get on that now that all the craziness of our expo is over and we're bored again, at least until PAX.

2506
03:05:19,093 --> 03:05:20,253
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, it sounded wonderful.

2507
03:05:20,333 --> 03:05:22,354
[SPEAKER_03]: It was fabulous to hear all the updates.

2508
03:05:22,754 --> 03:05:27,435
[SPEAKER_03]: It was in town, but all we LA-ers knew about it was that it kind of fucked up traffic.

2509
03:05:27,475 --> 03:05:30,495
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all we know about it.

2510
03:05:30,635 --> 03:05:32,256
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, hey, I will be back.

2511
03:05:32,856 --> 03:05:35,757
[SPEAKER_13]: I have a pass for Disneyland now, so I'll definitely be back.

2512
03:05:37,797 --> 03:05:38,717
[SPEAKER_13]: I will definitely let you know.

2513
03:05:38,777 --> 03:05:40,217
[SPEAKER_13]: Maybe an OLR LA meetup.

2514
03:05:40,538 --> 03:05:42,578
[SPEAKER_13]: But Marissa, we're going to let you go so we can wrap up our show, okay?

2515
03:05:43,470 --> 03:05:45,290
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely, and love to Jamie too.

2516
03:05:45,590 --> 03:05:47,191
[SPEAKER_03]: Marissa, come up here and hang out with me.

2517
03:05:47,231 --> 03:05:48,851
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, come to Sacramento and be on the show, please.

2518
03:05:49,231 --> 03:05:49,691
[SPEAKER_13]: Make it happen.

2519
03:05:50,992 --> 03:05:51,712
[SPEAKER_13]: All right, take care, buddy.

2520
03:05:53,232 --> 03:05:55,152
[SPEAKER_13]: All right, we're going to go ahead and have that be the last call.

2521
03:05:55,172 --> 03:05:57,173
[SPEAKER_13]: I think all the people that were dying to get through got through.

2522
03:05:57,493 --> 03:05:58,173
[SPEAKER_13]: We want to wrap up.

2523
03:05:58,213 --> 03:06:00,013
[SPEAKER_13]: We're already like three hours and counting tonight.

2524
03:06:00,033 --> 03:06:01,054
[SPEAKER_04]: We had a Marissa.

2525
03:06:01,234 --> 03:06:02,594
[SPEAKER_13]: I know, it was very nice to hear from her.

2526
03:06:02,914 --> 03:06:05,575
[SPEAKER_13]: Loki, did you have anything else you wanted to get out there before we wrap up tonight?

2527
03:06:06,315 --> 03:06:08,015
[SPEAKER_14]: Mel, your arcade is actually an arcade game.

2528
03:06:09,015 --> 03:06:09,355
[SPEAKER_14]: Apparently.

2529
03:06:09,776 --> 03:06:11,356
[SPEAKER_14]: Because I see images of the cabinet now.

2530
03:06:12,301 --> 03:06:12,941
[SPEAKER_14]: So that makes sense.

2531
03:06:13,021 --> 03:06:14,943
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, there is another Xbox Live Arcade game then.

2532
03:06:15,063 --> 03:06:17,624
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know what it is.

2533
03:06:18,765 --> 03:06:19,585
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's see.

2534
03:06:20,486 --> 03:06:24,789
[SPEAKER_14]: Smash Brothers Brawl, the user online service is ending.

2535
03:06:25,909 --> 03:06:35,555
[SPEAKER_14]: That not being the multiplayer online service, but the service to upload user-generated snapshots, stage designs, and replay data will no longer be available.

2536
03:06:36,135 --> 03:06:36,716
[SPEAKER_13]: Why is that?

2537
03:06:36,836 --> 03:06:37,556
[SPEAKER_14]: That's kind of sad.

2538
03:06:37,736 --> 03:06:38,237
[SPEAKER_14]: No word.

2539
03:06:39,678 --> 03:06:40,298
[SPEAKER_14]: No word at all.

2540
03:06:41,735 --> 03:06:42,235
[SPEAKER_14]: Interesting.

2541
03:06:42,636 --> 03:06:42,896
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

2542
03:06:43,456 --> 03:06:45,437
[SPEAKER_14]: Something else interesting Smash Bros.

2543
03:06:45,537 --> 03:06:46,317
[SPEAKER_14]: Brawl related.

2544
03:06:46,697 --> 03:06:51,559
[SPEAKER_14]: Apparently there's a flaw or an exploit that's been discovered in the stage builder.

2545
03:06:51,939 --> 03:06:55,420
[SPEAKER_14]: That will allow you to run... Oh yes, you know it.

2546
03:06:56,180 --> 03:06:57,741
[SPEAKER_14]: Arbitrary homebrew code.

2547
03:06:58,281 --> 03:06:58,721
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

2548
03:06:58,841 --> 03:07:00,322
[SPEAKER_14]: This is why it's getting closed.

2549
03:07:00,922 --> 03:07:01,362
[SPEAKER_14]: Here we go.

2550
03:07:01,442 --> 03:07:06,344
[SPEAKER_14]: Another exploit just like Twilight Princess.

2551
03:07:10,788 --> 03:07:13,172
[SPEAKER_14]: And then, um, let's see here.

2552
03:07:15,295 --> 03:07:19,441
[SPEAKER_14]: And apparently Sony says that E3 is not a proper venue to announce any PS3 price drops.

2553
03:07:21,464 --> 03:07:22,565
[SPEAKER_14]: Excuses, excuses.

2554
03:07:24,869 --> 03:07:25,209
[SPEAKER_06]: That's it.

2555
03:07:25,229 --> 03:07:26,351
[SPEAKER_13]: That's all I got.

2556
03:07:26,957 --> 03:07:27,918
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm having a change of heart.

2557
03:07:27,958 --> 03:07:29,979
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm opening up the phone line one more time.

2558
03:07:30,059 --> 03:07:34,061
[SPEAKER_13]: So if we want to get a couple more calls in, we'll give it just a minute to see if anyone else calls.

2559
03:07:34,201 --> 03:07:36,843
[SPEAKER_13]: And we'll give it, again, two-minute rules in effect.

2560
03:07:36,863 --> 03:07:41,245
[SPEAKER_13]: 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

2561
03:07:41,946 --> 03:07:43,286
[SPEAKER_13]: And then we're going to wrap up.

2562
03:07:43,366 --> 03:07:45,047
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know if we're going to do much of an afterbirth tonight.

2563
03:07:45,668 --> 03:07:46,128
[SPEAKER_13]: I really want to.

2564
03:07:47,302 --> 03:07:47,623
[SPEAKER_13]: Deathwishing

2565
03:08:07,740 --> 03:08:18,623
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, okay, first of all, everyone, get feel, it's a, like, for me, if you're not gonna like it, rent it, because it's just so massive, it's 5,000 square miles of just racing, and it's just...

2566
03:08:20,250 --> 03:08:20,510
[SPEAKER_13]: Wow.

2567
03:08:21,631 --> 03:08:22,111
[SPEAKER_13]: Interesting.

2568
03:08:22,752 --> 03:08:26,475
[SPEAKER_13]: I've heard a lot of negative things about Fuel on the game review sites, but that's now two people.

2569
03:08:26,495 --> 03:08:29,037
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, like Edge and IGN, but those sites suck anyways.

2570
03:08:29,517 --> 03:08:29,877
[SPEAKER_13]: True enough.

2571
03:08:30,218 --> 03:08:30,798
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, I'm sorry.

2572
03:08:30,858 --> 03:08:31,118
[SPEAKER_13]: Go ahead.

2573
03:08:31,379 --> 03:08:32,700
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways, here we go with E3.

2574
03:08:32,800 --> 03:08:33,540
[SPEAKER_02]: Assassin's Creed 2.

2575
03:08:33,720 --> 03:08:34,401
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just going to show you.

2576
03:08:34,461 --> 03:08:35,902
[SPEAKER_02]: If I say, ugh, that means it's good.

2577
03:08:35,982 --> 03:08:37,143
[SPEAKER_02]: If I go, aw, that means no.

2578
03:08:37,263 --> 03:08:38,444
[SPEAKER_02]: Assassin's Creed 2.

2579
03:08:38,724 --> 03:08:39,024
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

2580
03:08:41,166 --> 03:08:42,207
[SPEAKER_02]: Splinter Cell Conviction.

2581
03:08:42,407 --> 03:08:43,408
[SPEAKER_02]: I shit my pants.

2582
03:08:44,649 --> 03:08:44,749
[SPEAKER_02]: Um...

2583
03:08:46,263 --> 03:08:58,870
[SPEAKER_02]: Halo Reach, I'm actually excited because it's a Halo based on the book Fallout Reach, which is going to explain why there are Spartans and why there's only four.

2584
03:08:59,931 --> 03:09:04,794
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm sorry, but the PS3 motion control looks like a sex toy.

2585
03:09:06,535 --> 03:09:07,795
[SPEAKER_02]: You say this like it's a problem.

2586
03:09:08,436 --> 03:09:08,756
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it is.

2587
03:09:08,776 --> 03:09:10,017
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks like a sex toy.

2588
03:09:10,937 --> 03:09:11,618
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe it is.

2589
03:09:14,319 --> 03:09:15,420
[SPEAKER_05]: Why do we have a problem with this?

2590
03:09:16,848 --> 03:09:19,123
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, it's gonna give little kids ideas.

2591
03:09:20,885 --> 03:09:23,166
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that's just because their mommy and daddy didn't teach them right.

2592
03:09:24,686 --> 03:09:30,669
[SPEAKER_14]: It's just going to encourage people to put glowing balls on their penis and then try to get the thing to follow their penis.

2593
03:09:30,689 --> 03:09:31,269
[SPEAKER_14]: Hey, you know what?

2594
03:09:31,329 --> 03:09:31,749
[SPEAKER_14]: It's fine.

2595
03:09:31,809 --> 03:09:32,189
[SPEAKER_14]: It's fine.

2596
03:09:32,829 --> 03:09:35,831
[SPEAKER_13]: For boys, you can put the Wii Vitalize on your wiener.

2597
03:09:35,931 --> 03:09:38,892
[SPEAKER_13]: For the girls, you can put the PS3 motion control on your pussy.

2598
03:09:38,932 --> 03:09:39,612
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm not finished.

2599
03:09:39,912 --> 03:09:40,412
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, sorry.

2600
03:09:40,452 --> 03:09:43,093
[SPEAKER_02]: Project Natal.

2601
03:09:43,273 --> 03:09:46,855
[SPEAKER_02]: You know how with Rainbow Six Vegas you could do the facial scan and put your face in the game?

2602
03:09:47,635 --> 03:09:47,755
[SPEAKER_06]: Mm-hmm.

2603
03:09:48,277 --> 03:09:50,798
[SPEAKER_02]: Now think of Project Assault putting your whole body in the game.

2604
03:09:51,959 --> 03:09:57,421
[SPEAKER_14]: Also, remember they showed that little tech demo with Peter Monono and that little child?

2605
03:09:57,842 --> 03:09:59,442
[SPEAKER_14]: And remember he needed a drawing?

2606
03:09:59,943 --> 03:10:00,643
[SPEAKER_14]: Come on!

2607
03:10:00,923 --> 03:10:02,624
[SPEAKER_14]: Someone's going to put their penis on there!

2608
03:10:02,724 --> 03:10:03,684
[SPEAKER_14]: It's going to happen!

2609
03:10:03,964 --> 03:10:04,905
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I know that.

2610
03:10:05,225 --> 03:10:07,106
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't wait to scan my nude body.

2611
03:10:07,366 --> 03:10:11,248
[SPEAKER_02]: When you use that in a first person shooter, what's going to happen to the fat guy?

2612
03:10:11,268 --> 03:10:12,669
[SPEAKER_02]: He's going to have a bigger hitbox.

2613
03:10:14,029 --> 03:10:15,710
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright, quickly, because we talked over your call.

2614
03:10:15,730 --> 03:10:17,431
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll give you 15 more seconds to wrap it up.

2615
03:10:21,044 --> 03:10:22,384
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been playing 1 vs. 100.

2616
03:10:22,444 --> 03:10:23,425
[SPEAKER_02]: You need to join in, Rob.

2617
03:10:23,685 --> 03:10:28,167
[SPEAKER_02]: This Tuesday, I think they're having another live episode, the 12th, and I would join in if I were you.

2618
03:10:28,488 --> 03:10:29,188
[SPEAKER_13]: I will try to play.

2619
03:10:29,208 --> 03:10:30,149
[SPEAKER_13]: I will do my best.

2620
03:10:30,189 --> 03:10:30,949
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright, we gotta let you go.

2621
03:10:31,069 --> 03:10:31,349
[SPEAKER_13]: Have fun.

2622
03:10:31,830 --> 03:10:32,350
Bye!

2623
03:10:33,751 --> 03:10:38,093
[SPEAKER_13]: I liked his whole uh and buh scale that he didn't even really use.

2624
03:10:39,554 --> 03:10:40,514
[SPEAKER_04]: It was fascinating.

2625
03:10:44,178 --> 03:10:48,099
[SPEAKER_13]: Marissa asked in chat, what is it with guys and putting their penis everywhere?

2626
03:10:48,139 --> 03:10:50,339
[SPEAKER_13]: And Frisbee has the right answer, because they can.

2627
03:10:52,540 --> 03:10:54,600
[SPEAKER_13]: We talked about this a little earlier in the show.

2628
03:10:54,640 --> 03:10:58,281
[SPEAKER_14]: Hey, I don't do it, but I just report it how I see it.

2629
03:10:58,741 --> 03:10:59,962
[SPEAKER_14]: History has proven itself.

2630
03:11:00,162 --> 03:11:04,043
[SPEAKER_14]: If it can have a penis put in on it, a penis will be put on it.

2631
03:11:04,223 --> 03:11:06,283
[SPEAKER_13]: Folks, we do not make the news.

2632
03:11:06,443 --> 03:11:07,544
[SPEAKER_13]: We merely report on it.

2633
03:11:07,764 --> 03:11:08,904
[SPEAKER_05]: The cock always wins, huh?

2634
03:11:08,924 --> 03:11:11,604
[SPEAKER_13]: All right, on that thought, we've got to go around and get everybody's final thoughts.

2635
03:11:11,644 --> 03:11:12,665
[SPEAKER_13]: We're on out of here for tonight.

2636
03:11:12,745 --> 03:11:13,705
[SPEAKER_13]: Loki, any final thoughts?

2637
03:11:15,488 --> 03:11:16,588
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm glad to be back.

2638
03:11:16,608 --> 03:11:17,409
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm tired.

2639
03:11:18,269 --> 03:11:20,989
[SPEAKER_13]: My final thought is sleep is awesome.

2640
03:11:21,049 --> 03:11:22,410
[SPEAKER_13]: DarkSakura, do you have any final thoughts?

2641
03:11:23,210 --> 03:11:24,790
[SPEAKER_05]: My husband didn't bring me a milkshake.

2642
03:11:25,370 --> 03:11:26,091
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm disappointed.

2643
03:11:26,371 --> 03:11:27,991
[SPEAKER_13]: He's so fired for that.

2644
03:11:28,611 --> 03:11:28,791
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

2645
03:11:28,811 --> 03:11:31,092
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you guys so much for tuning into and downloading our show.

2646
03:11:31,132 --> 03:11:32,072
[SPEAKER_13]: We really appreciate it.

2647
03:11:32,112 --> 03:11:33,912
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you for supporting independent podcasting.

2648
03:11:34,232 --> 03:11:35,233
[SPEAKER_13]: You guys are amazing.

2649
03:11:35,393 --> 03:11:40,974
[SPEAKER_13]: And thank you for staying up late with us tonight and putting up with our crap if you're listening to it on the podcast feed.

2650
03:11:41,334 --> 03:11:42,374
[SPEAKER_13]: Getting all the way here to the end.

2651
03:11:42,694 --> 03:11:43,435
[SPEAKER_13]: Really appreciate it.

2652
03:11:44,175 --> 03:11:45,215
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you guys again so much.

2653
03:11:45,255 --> 03:11:48,036
[SPEAKER_13]: If you like what you hear, please tell two friends about our show.

2654
03:11:48,336 --> 03:11:49,497
[SPEAKER_13]: Word of mouth is how we sell it.

2655
03:11:49,757 --> 03:11:50,737
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you guys so much.

2656
03:11:50,997 --> 03:11:51,898
[SPEAKER_13]: Have a wonderful night.

2657
03:11:51,938 --> 03:11:54,078
[SPEAKER_13]: We will see you next week with more gaming news.

2658
03:11:54,118 --> 03:11:57,019
[SPEAKER_13]: Hey, just because E3's over doesn't mean the video game news is stopping.

2659
03:11:57,039 --> 03:11:58,020
[SPEAKER_13]: We'll be back next week.

2660
03:11:58,420 --> 03:12:06,382
[SPEAKER_13]: Maybe since we'll probably have a lull in the news next week since everybody shot their wad this week, maybe next week we'll be able to play some good old-fashioned OLR games.

2661
03:12:06,703 --> 03:12:07,823
[SPEAKER_13]: So look forward to that next week.

2662
03:12:08,174 --> 03:12:09,796
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that sounds like a stupendous idea.

2663
03:12:09,956 --> 03:12:13,321
[SPEAKER_13]: All right, then stay tuned to next week in another stupendous show.

2664
03:12:14,282 --> 03:12:16,846
[SPEAKER_13]: In the meantime, I am the stupendous Rob Roberts.

2665
03:12:16,866 --> 03:12:20,170
[SPEAKER_13]: That's the amazing Jamie Summers, and he's the OK Loki.

2666
03:12:20,631 --> 03:12:22,593
[SPEAKER_13]: And we'll see you next week here on Orange Launch Radio.

2667
03:12:23,234 --> 03:12:26,015
[SPEAKER_09]: You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

2668
03:12:26,535 --> 03:12:29,756
[SPEAKER_09]: Orange Lounge Radio is an Orange Lounge production.

2669
03:12:30,217 --> 03:12:38,860
[SPEAKER_09]: To join us for a live show, visit www.allgames.com Sunday nights at 6pm Pacific Time.

2670
03:12:39,360 --> 03:12:50,944
[SPEAKER_09]: The views and opinions expressed on Orange Lounge Radio do not necessarily reflect those of the entire staff of Orange Lounge Radio or allgames.com, but we're probably right anyway.

2671
03:12:51,545 --> 03:12:52,345
[SPEAKER_09]: See you next week!
