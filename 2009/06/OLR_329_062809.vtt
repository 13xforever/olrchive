00:00.000 --> 00:03.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:07.000 --> 00:13.000
We're your hosts, DarkSakura, Sky and Loco UK

00:14.000 --> 00:22.000
Tonight, June 28, 2009, we kick back and celebrate 7 years of Orange Lounge Radio with all of our listeners

00:22.000 --> 00:30.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:31.000 --> 00:36.000
Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio

00:36.000 --> 00:40.000
We are that video game talk show dedicated of course to video games

00:40.000 --> 00:43.000
Video gaming, gaming culture and the gamer lifestyle

00:43.000 --> 00:46.000
We like to say it's a place where every gamer has a voice

00:46.000 --> 00:50.000
But it's going to be these three voices walking you through the next few hours here

00:50.000 --> 00:52.000
When we tape live on all games radio

00:52.000 --> 00:58.000
Myself, Rob Roberts and the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summer is here as well

00:58.000 --> 00:59.000
Hi

00:59.000 --> 01:00.000
How are you?

01:00.000 --> 01:01.000
Beat

01:01.000 --> 01:03.000
It's hot, it is hot in Sacramento today

01:03.000 --> 01:07.000
It was 107 last time that I checked

01:07.000 --> 01:13.000
And today was my walking evaluation, but we got to stay inside the air conditioning

01:13.000 --> 01:16.000
Yeah, I was going to say, that's pretty cruel making me walk outside in the heat

01:16.000 --> 01:21.000
Our teacher is like, there's no way in hell I'm making you guys go outside, we'll go break into the cardio room

01:21.000 --> 01:22.000
Fun

01:22.000 --> 01:24.000
And also say hello to Techmaster Loki

01:24.000 --> 01:25.000
Hello

01:25.000 --> 01:26.000
How are you doing Loki?

01:26.000 --> 01:27.000
Good

01:27.000 --> 01:28.000
Stay indoors today?

01:28.000 --> 01:30.000
Yeah, I painted baseboards

01:30.000 --> 01:33.000
Fun, being a homeowner rocks doesn't it?

01:33.000 --> 01:34.000
Yeah

01:34.000 --> 01:35.000
Awesome

01:35.000 --> 01:38.000
And then I remember you said something about not being able to get shows

01:38.000 --> 01:40.000
I'm sorry, stories for the show tonight

01:40.000 --> 01:46.000
Yeah, because the internet was there, Comcast is working on improving their network in our neighborhood

01:46.000 --> 01:47.000
I don't know what that exactly means

01:47.000 --> 01:49.000
So your house is just broken right now?

01:49.000 --> 01:51.000
Today at least, it's alright

01:51.000 --> 01:56.000
Well hey guys, it is the seventh year anniversary of Orange Lounge Radio believe it or not

01:56.000 --> 01:58.000
We've been talking about it for a couple weeks now

01:58.000 --> 02:00.000
Kind of hyping it up a little bit

02:00.000 --> 02:02.000
And sure enough, we started this little program

02:02.000 --> 02:06.000
The very first episode was June 23, 2002

02:06.000 --> 02:10.000
Which means this week we hit seven years of Orange Lounge Radio

02:10.000 --> 02:11.000
And that's with no major breaks

02:11.000 --> 02:14.000
I mean sure, a week here and a week there

02:14.000 --> 02:17.000
I think maybe a two week break happened once or twice

02:17.000 --> 02:21.000
But honestly, we've been running pretty regularly with no extended breaks

02:21.000 --> 02:22.000
Through that whole time

02:22.000 --> 02:25.000
So that is kind of an accomplishment

02:25.000 --> 02:26.000
So we can admit it

02:26.000 --> 02:29.000
We can take a minute to say

02:29.000 --> 02:32.000
Thanks to all of you for helping make it happen

02:32.000 --> 02:36.000
Because I'll tell you what, that very first show, the very first night, episode number one

02:36.000 --> 02:38.000
We had twelve people listening

02:38.000 --> 02:43.000
And now on AllGames.com, when we tape live, we get as many as thirteen

02:43.000 --> 02:44.000
So we've really grown

02:44.000 --> 02:47.000
No, I'm just kidding, obviously we have a little more than that

02:47.000 --> 02:49.000
But it's just been great

02:49.000 --> 02:51.000
You guys really have taken that to heart, what we say at the end of every show

02:51.000 --> 02:53.000
To just tell more people about our show

02:53.000 --> 02:55.000
And it's worked and we've grown a little bit

02:55.000 --> 02:59.000
So thank you guys so much for helping us reach seven years of Orange Lounge Radio

02:59.000 --> 03:02.000
Here's the funny thing about tonight's show

03:02.000 --> 03:05.000
It's been a really crazy week for all of us

03:05.000 --> 03:07.000
I think personally and everything else

03:07.000 --> 03:11.000
Just like the show a couple of weeks ago

03:11.000 --> 03:13.000
We didn't really prepare a list of topics to talk about

03:13.000 --> 03:14.000
But here's the thing

03:14.000 --> 03:16.000
Two weeks ago, we had E3

03:16.000 --> 03:17.000
That made it easy

03:17.000 --> 03:21.000
We had three hours to talk all about E3 and what happened there

03:21.000 --> 03:23.000
Tonight, not so much

03:23.000 --> 03:26.000
So we're going to just do it the old fashioned way

03:26.000 --> 03:28.000
Because this is the way we did the show for many, many years

03:28.000 --> 03:30.000
So we're going to see if we've still got it in us

03:30.000 --> 03:32.000
And we're just going to wing it, folks

03:32.000 --> 03:33.000
Here at Orange Lounge Radio

03:33.000 --> 03:34.000
We're just going to wing it tonight

03:34.000 --> 03:38.000
We've started assigning positions as if Orange Lounge was a starship

03:38.000 --> 03:39.000
Yes, and what's your position?

03:39.000 --> 03:40.000
Captain

03:40.000 --> 03:42.000
What's my position?

03:42.000 --> 03:45.000
First officer, because you have to talk to everybody and be my voice

03:45.000 --> 03:46.000
What would be Loki's position?

03:46.000 --> 03:48.000
Oh, Worf

03:48.000 --> 03:51.000
We've given Loki's security officer position

03:51.000 --> 03:53.000
Because he's the most aggressive of us all

03:53.000 --> 03:56.000
And Jason is our ship's engineer

03:56.000 --> 03:59.000
Deep Man kind of does that too, though

03:59.000 --> 04:01.000
Well no, Jason would be like the engineer

04:01.000 --> 04:04.000
Deep Man's kind of the person that would actually

04:04.000 --> 04:05.000
Science officer?

04:05.000 --> 04:06.000
Okay

04:06.000 --> 04:07.000
He can be our science officer

04:07.000 --> 04:08.000
Like data?

04:08.000 --> 04:09.000
Data

04:09.000 --> 04:10.000
Yeah

04:10.000 --> 04:11.000
And then that means that

04:11.000 --> 04:13.000
Because I was going to say that Tiara was our science officer

04:13.000 --> 04:15.000
But I'm going to make her

04:15.000 --> 04:16.000
Sulu

04:16.000 --> 04:17.000
She's our Sulu

04:17.000 --> 04:19.000
She can be our Sulu

04:19.000 --> 04:20.000
Oh my

04:20.000 --> 04:22.000
No, Deep Man can be our Uhura

04:22.000 --> 04:25.000
Because he does so much communication stuff for us

04:25.000 --> 04:27.000
He's our communications officer

04:27.000 --> 04:30.000
So Sos could be our science officer

04:30.000 --> 04:33.000
And then our Sulu is Misty

04:33.000 --> 04:34.000
Okay

04:34.000 --> 04:35.000
She can drive us

04:35.000 --> 04:37.000
Now is there a farting officer?

04:37.000 --> 04:39.000
Because we need Rice Princess to have a role

04:39.000 --> 04:40.000
Chris is ship's lesbian

04:40.000 --> 04:43.000
Official ship's lesbian

04:43.000 --> 04:44.000
Okay

04:44.000 --> 04:45.000
Would she be the Troy?

04:45.000 --> 04:47.000
Rice Princess can be our check off

04:47.000 --> 04:49.000
So she can scream at people

04:49.000 --> 04:50.000
Okay

04:50.000 --> 04:51.000
And

04:51.000 --> 04:52.000
I like this

04:52.000 --> 04:56.000
And do like our advanced calculations and stuff

04:56.000 --> 04:57.000
But we need a ship's counselor

04:57.000 --> 04:59.000
Now everybody in chat is screaming, you know

04:59.000 --> 05:00.000
Who's going to be Quark?

05:00.000 --> 05:01.000
Who's going to be Scotty?

05:01.000 --> 05:03.000
Who's the doctor?

05:03.000 --> 05:05.000
This isn't DS9, hello?

05:05.000 --> 05:06.000
We don't have Quark

05:06.000 --> 05:08.000
We have somebody called the doctor already

05:08.000 --> 05:09.000
So I don't

05:09.000 --> 05:11.000
The doctor would be the doctor, silly

05:11.000 --> 05:13.000
Ship's doctor will be Sherby

05:13.000 --> 05:15.000
Alright

05:15.000 --> 05:16.000
Meow meow

05:16.000 --> 05:17.000
Alright

05:17.000 --> 05:19.000
She's ship's cat

05:19.000 --> 05:21.000
Let's do what we used to do here on the show

05:21.000 --> 05:23.000
And instead of talking just about games

05:23.000 --> 05:25.000
Ooh, Patty and Sulu

05:25.000 --> 05:28.000
Get away from the damn Star Trek for a minute

05:28.000 --> 05:31.000
There's some folks that don't even like Trek listening to the show

05:31.000 --> 05:33.000
Oh, Game Guru said that Loki's our red shirt

05:33.000 --> 05:34.000
Hey, if you want to

05:34.000 --> 05:35.000
That's not very nice

05:35.000 --> 05:39.000
If you want to join the chat room and scream Star Trek obscenities with the rest of our chat

05:39.000 --> 05:42.000
chat.orangelaunchradio.com is the place to be

05:42.000 --> 05:45.000
When we tape live on Sunday nights at All Games Radio

05:45.000 --> 05:47.000
At 6 o'clock Pacific Standard Time

05:47.000 --> 05:51.000
9 o'clock Eastern Time right after the Bobby Black Wolf show on Sunday nights

05:51.000 --> 05:54.000
Let's go around and hear a little bit about

05:54.000 --> 05:56.000
I've been changed up a little bit tonight

05:56.000 --> 05:58.000
Because you know what, we've been doing this 7 years

05:58.000 --> 06:00.000
If we want to talk about ourselves a little bit tonight

06:00.000 --> 06:01.000
Get away from the games a bit

06:01.000 --> 06:02.000
We can do that

06:02.000 --> 06:04.000
We're going to do how was your day, how was your week tonight

06:04.000 --> 06:06.000
Not just, you know, throw games into it

06:06.000 --> 06:07.000
I'm sure you've played some stuff too, but

06:07.000 --> 06:09.000
Dark Soccer, we'll start with you as we always do

06:09.000 --> 06:11.000
How was your day, how was your week?

06:11.000 --> 06:12.000
My day was hot

06:12.000 --> 06:14.000
And kind of crappy

06:14.000 --> 06:17.000
Um, also I left something, oh here it is

06:17.000 --> 06:20.000
Um, yes, to, I've been in a lot of pain

06:20.000 --> 06:23.000
From my finger, so tomorrow I'm having surgery

06:23.000 --> 06:26.000
Done on it at 7 in the fucking morning

06:26.000 --> 06:27.000
On my day off

06:27.000 --> 06:30.000
Because I'm now officially on leave from work for a month

06:30.000 --> 06:31.000
Congrats

06:31.000 --> 06:32.000
Aww

06:32.000 --> 06:34.000
With disability pay

06:34.000 --> 06:38.000
Um, but no really, I've needed my finger surgery done

06:38.000 --> 06:40.000
I was supposed to have it done at the end of July

06:40.000 --> 06:42.000
She's going on the dole

06:42.000 --> 06:45.000
Well, I, they, they, someone cancelled

06:45.000 --> 06:47.000
And so I was able to get it done tomorrow

06:47.000 --> 06:49.000
And that is such a blessing

06:49.000 --> 06:50.000
Surgery's important though

06:50.000 --> 06:53.000
Yeah, it's a 30 minute procedure

06:53.000 --> 06:54.000
I'm going to be awake through the whole thing

06:54.000 --> 06:55.000
Oh my gosh

06:55.000 --> 06:58.000
But I won't feel, they won't let me watch, bastards

06:58.000 --> 07:00.000
So, anyway

07:00.000 --> 07:02.000
Um, as it's, as it's going, um

07:02.000 --> 07:06.000
I've kind of, it sort of really hit me kind of hard this morning

07:06.000 --> 07:07.000
So I've been kind of pissy

07:07.000 --> 07:09.000
Try not to be pissy, I've tried to stay in a good mood

07:09.000 --> 07:14.000
But unfortunately, when you're pissy, there's not a lot that keep you from just being pissy, you know

07:14.000 --> 07:16.000
So I'm supposed to go to a birthday party today

07:16.000 --> 07:20.000
Because Julie's birthday was, um, Thursday

07:20.000 --> 07:22.000
And yours was Friday, so happy birthday

07:22.000 --> 07:23.000
Indeed it was, thank you

07:23.000 --> 07:24.000
I'm sorry, I couldn't make it

07:24.000 --> 07:25.000
That's okay, I didn't have a lot of stuff

07:25.000 --> 07:26.000
I called you

07:26.000 --> 07:27.000
Yeah, you did

07:27.000 --> 07:28.000
And we've got plans later this week

07:28.000 --> 07:29.000
Yes

07:29.000 --> 07:31.000
And you need to meet the BF and all that fun stuff

07:31.000 --> 07:32.000
So we'll, we'll take care of that later this week

07:32.000 --> 07:35.000
Indian food while I'm high is a kite, that should be funny

07:35.000 --> 07:36.000
Um

07:36.000 --> 07:41.000
I just want to read from DJ Morpheus in chat, our old buddy who hosts, uh, Under Sedation Live

07:41.000 --> 07:47.000
Which, you know, if there's one show that's been in existence longer than Orange Lounge Radio, it's Under Sedation Live

07:47.000 --> 07:51.000
Now granted, they had some big breaks, but we got our big break on Under Sedation Live

07:51.000 --> 07:54.000
I do not have to learn to play with myself with my other hand

07:54.000 --> 07:56.000
That's why God made toys

07:56.000 --> 08:01.000
Those are the kinds of things that, uh, DJ Morpheus will throw out there on Saturday nights right here on All Games Radio

08:01.000 --> 08:02.000
Where he tapes his show now

08:02.000 --> 08:06.000
I do want to also point out, he did say, hope they cut open the right body part

08:06.000 --> 08:11.000
Cause that would kind of suck to go in there and then like, you know, suddenly you come out of there and you have bigger boobs

08:11.000 --> 08:15.000
They could cut open the wrong body part and take out part of it, that'd be happy

08:15.000 --> 08:16.000
Alright

08:16.000 --> 08:20.000
Um, anyway, as far as, uh, my week

08:20.000 --> 08:21.000
Yes

08:21.000 --> 08:22.000
Um

08:22.000 --> 08:24.000
I was at work

08:24.000 --> 08:26.000
It kind of sucked

08:26.000 --> 08:29.000
And I was in a lot of pain, which sucked too

08:29.000 --> 08:33.000
And, um, I walked and I, um, yeah

08:33.000 --> 08:42.000
Tell us a little bit about the condition, because I think, you know, you haven't talked a lot about playing games yourself on the show in probably the past six months

08:42.000 --> 08:47.000
And, I mean, granted you've had some on the DSSF, but I think people don't understand that you have something up with your hand

08:47.000 --> 08:50.000
Like you can't really do the controllers for very long

08:50.000 --> 08:51.000
So

08:51.000 --> 08:55.000
It actually, I'll tell you what hurts most about playing a game is, um

08:55.000 --> 08:58.000
And by the way, um, I agree with Travis, he is our cue

08:58.000 --> 09:04.000
Um, what, it's called flexor tendonitis

09:04.000 --> 09:13.000
Um, so to translate it means that the, you know, when you flex your muscles, when you flex your fingers you're bending them

09:13.000 --> 09:18.000
If you straighten them out you're extending, so it's in the tendons that bend the muscles

09:18.000 --> 09:22.000
And, um, those muscles, of course, are in your forearm

09:22.000 --> 09:25.000
And the tendons run from your forearm to your finger

09:25.000 --> 09:31.000
And, um, it's my middle two fingers of my right hand, my, uh, my flipping off everybody because they suck finger

09:31.000 --> 09:34.000
And my not getting married finger, which is the other hand

09:34.000 --> 09:36.000
So, um, it's on my right hand

09:36.000 --> 09:42.000
So, um, anyway, those, the tendons that when they attach to the muscles in your fingers

09:42.000 --> 09:45.000
There's a sheath around them of, uh, of tissue

09:45.000 --> 09:49.000
You know, some of the kind of holds it in place so that they don't bow out, you know

09:49.000 --> 09:54.000
Like when you have a bow strung too tightly and the things start popping out

09:54.000 --> 09:56.000
Um, it keeps the tendons in place

09:56.000 --> 10:00.000
And what happens is I have swelling on my hand

10:00.000 --> 10:06.000
If you look at your palm, up above the center of your palm where the, the really fleshy part is right under your fingers

10:06.000 --> 10:08.000
Um, I have a knot on each tendon

10:08.000 --> 10:12.000
And what happens is that if you imagine like a pulley

10:12.000 --> 10:18.000
The knot gets caught on that sheath of skin going, on that sheath of tissue going into the fingers

10:18.000 --> 10:24.000
And so when I try to straighten out my fingers, it pops, like it's shoving past that

10:24.000 --> 10:28.000
Like, like you're trying to fit something into a tube that's too small for it

10:28.000 --> 10:30.000
You know what I mean?

10:30.000 --> 10:34.000
Uh, act deaf in our chat room says flex or tendinitis, it sounds like a DJ

10:34.000 --> 10:35.000
A little bit

10:35.000 --> 10:39.000
Well, um, that, that's really, I think the best way I can describe it

10:39.000 --> 10:43.000
So what they're gonna, gonna do is actually, um, cut my hand open

10:43.000 --> 10:47.000
And it's just like they're, like they, um, open two little flaps on either side

10:47.000 --> 10:56.000
And they're gonna snip the tendon sheath so that, that lump will have, won't have that tight of an area to go through

10:56.000 --> 11:01.000
Um, and what happens is that the tendon sheath will heal around the larger lump now

11:01.000 --> 11:04.000
And, you know, most, it has a pretty high success rate

11:04.000 --> 11:08.000
It's fairly, you know, it, it's a 30 minute procedure

11:08.000 --> 11:10.000
I'm gonna be awake for it, they're just gonna numb it up

11:10.000 --> 11:12.000
Um, DJ Flexer

11:12.000 --> 11:15.000
So they're circumcising your hand?

11:15.000 --> 11:17.000
No, I'm not having skin removed from it

11:17.000 --> 11:19.000
They're just making a little cut

11:19.000 --> 11:26.000
Um, but the whole problem as far as how it hurts is that now it's to the point that even when my fingers are straightened out

11:26.000 --> 11:31.000
If I try to bend them, that lump, it's just so much swelling in my fingers

11:31.000 --> 11:33.000
Cause you can actually see it on my palm

11:33.000 --> 11:34.000
Well, I'm showing Rob

11:34.000 --> 11:35.000
Great radio

11:35.000 --> 11:38.000
But, um, but it, it's visible on my palm now

11:38.000 --> 11:42.000
And it's just not very, it hurts a lot actually

11:42.000 --> 11:43.000
It's really sore

11:43.000 --> 11:45.000
And the place where the lumps are on

11:45.000 --> 11:47.000
You know what they say about folks with swelled palms?

11:47.000 --> 11:49.000
They hurt?

11:49.000 --> 11:50.000
Nevermind

11:50.000 --> 11:52.000
Oh wait, that's hairy palms

11:52.000 --> 11:55.000
You know what they say about, about, about men with big, with big feet?

11:55.000 --> 11:56.000
Uh, big socks?

11:56.000 --> 11:57.000
Big shoes

11:57.000 --> 12:07.000
Um, but, um, now, holding a controller now is me telling everyone right exactly where the, where the owies are

12:07.000 --> 12:15.000
Imagine having a piece of hard plastic shoved against swollen tendon tissue for, oh, longer than ten minutes

12:15.000 --> 12:18.000
Imagine not being able to bend your middle two fingers

12:18.000 --> 12:19.000
It hurts to hold a fork

12:19.000 --> 12:23.000
I can't hold, um, and, you know, you know I do graphic art and everything

12:23.000 --> 12:27.000
I can't hold my stylus or a pen that isn't, like, a big child-sized fat highlighter

12:27.000 --> 12:29.000
Or, you know, smelly markers

12:29.000 --> 12:31.000
For longer than ten minutes

12:31.000 --> 12:33.000
And it's really getting in the way of my life

12:33.000 --> 12:37.000
So, I'm just gonna say, cortisone, I've had two rounds of cortisone

12:37.000 --> 12:39.000
Two shots in each finger

12:39.000 --> 12:40.000
I'm, I'm done

12:40.000 --> 12:43.000
I'm ready just to have the surgery done and get it over with

12:43.000 --> 12:46.000
Well this is like real trauma in the ER type of thing

12:46.000 --> 12:48.000
Although it's not really an emergency, it's not bad

12:48.000 --> 12:50.000
It's not a big procedure

12:50.000 --> 12:52.000
It sounds a lot like what my mom had a couple years ago

12:52.000 --> 12:55.000
She had her shoulder operated on and her shoulder was preventing her from painting

12:55.000 --> 12:58.000
And I know that was really rough on her

12:58.000 --> 13:01.000
Because, you know, she's older, she's past 65 at this point

13:01.000 --> 13:04.000
She's long retired from, you know, being a preschool teacher and nanny

13:04.000 --> 13:05.000
The stuff she did

13:05.000 --> 13:07.000
She likes to paint, that's how she passes the time

13:07.000 --> 13:09.000
So having to have that surgery was rough for her

13:09.000 --> 13:11.000
But now she can paint again and she's really happy

13:11.000 --> 13:13.000
So soon you'll be able to play games again

13:13.000 --> 13:15.000
The shitty thing that I'm having to put back on because my finger hurts

13:15.000 --> 13:18.000
I'm glad I never have to wear it again after my stitches come out

13:18.000 --> 13:22.000
Although it is cool that you can flip people off just 24-7 with that thing

13:22.000 --> 13:26.000
Yeah, because it's basically a splint that straps to my wrist

13:26.000 --> 13:29.000
And hangs on the outside of my hand over my middle finger

13:29.000 --> 13:32.000
So I can't bend it, it forces it to stay relaxed

13:32.000 --> 13:36.000
Well I bet you can't wait for Project Natal because you won't need a controller for that

13:36.000 --> 13:38.000
You can just wave your hand around like a lunatic

13:38.000 --> 13:40.000
That would be fun

13:40.000 --> 13:44.000
Well I mean supposedly I could do that with the Wii mode if I played left-handed

13:44.000 --> 13:48.000
Which actually Wii games are surprisingly easy for me to play

13:48.000 --> 13:51.000
Because I haven't really had to do anything, you know

13:51.000 --> 13:56.000
But like today when we were doing our exercises I couldn't do push-ups

13:56.000 --> 14:01.000
So actually I had to use a ball, a weighted ball, and do reverse push-ups

14:01.000 --> 14:05.000
I couldn't do the rowing because I couldn't grip anything

14:05.000 --> 14:11.000
It's really, I mean people don't really realize exactly how much they use their hands

14:11.000 --> 14:13.000
Especially their dominant hand

14:13.000 --> 14:15.000
Until you're restricted in it

14:15.000 --> 14:21.000
And it was just like, I would just sit and just sketch, you know, for stress relief

14:21.000 --> 14:23.000
Couldn't do it

14:23.000 --> 14:26.000
I can't massage people except with my left hand

14:26.000 --> 14:31.000
Which fortunately enough my primary client, all of her problems are on her left side

14:31.000 --> 14:33.000
So that's fine

14:33.000 --> 14:38.000
But you know, it's just, it's gonna be an adjustment

14:38.000 --> 14:42.000
But I'm absolutely relieved

14:42.000 --> 14:45.000
Well now were you able to get into any gaming at all?

14:45.000 --> 14:47.000
Oh yeah, I'll play Sims, I can still play Sims

14:47.000 --> 14:49.000
After my surgery I can still play the hell out of Sims

14:49.000 --> 14:51.000
And screw everything else

14:51.000 --> 14:53.000
The mouse is a thumb trackball

14:53.000 --> 14:57.000
So I can still, I still have the use of my first finger and I can still use my thumb

14:57.000 --> 14:59.000
Have you beat the Sims yet?

14:59.000 --> 15:01.000
You don't beat the Sims

15:01.000 --> 15:03.000
You do if they're bad

15:03.000 --> 15:06.000
However, I made a Mii Sim

15:06.000 --> 15:09.000
And the first thing I mastered was video gaming

15:09.000 --> 15:11.000
Is that actually a skill in the Sims?

15:11.000 --> 15:13.000
Yes, it's one of the hidden skills

15:13.000 --> 15:16.000
You can just start playing video games and you can get up to level 10 master video games

15:16.000 --> 15:18.000
What happens if you max out your video gaming skill?

15:18.000 --> 15:20.000
Do you become like Fatality and you get your own line of video cards and stuff?

15:20.000 --> 15:22.000
No, you just are awesome

15:22.000 --> 15:26.000
But Sim Mii is a professional writer

15:26.000 --> 15:28.000
And a hacker

15:28.000 --> 15:30.000
Just because

15:30.000 --> 15:32.000
Alright, well

15:32.000 --> 15:34.000
Oh and I played Peggle

15:34.000 --> 15:36.000
I'm glad to see Sims is going fun

15:36.000 --> 15:38.000
I played Peggle on iPhone

15:38.000 --> 15:40.000
Yep, on iPhone

15:40.000 --> 15:42.000
I'm glad they did that sale

15:42.000 --> 15:44.000
That motivated me to buy it

15:44.000 --> 15:46.000
And for people who are using Linux

15:46.000 --> 15:50.000
They're actually a pretty good version of Breakout on Linux

15:50.000 --> 15:53.000
I'm running Linux Mint on my laptop

15:53.000 --> 15:57.000
And I like it that instead of using the arrow buttons to move your

15:57.000 --> 16:00.000
Your little bar around

16:00.000 --> 16:02.000
You actually use the touchpad

16:02.000 --> 16:06.000
It recognizes the touchpad and you can slide your finger back and forth to move your

16:06.000 --> 16:08.000
Your little

16:08.000 --> 16:10.000
Bounce bar

16:10.000 --> 16:12.000
So that was pretty fun

16:12.000 --> 16:14.000
I played

16:14.000 --> 16:16.000
I was at Boston Market

16:16.000 --> 16:19.000
And I was playing Breakout over Chicken at Boston Market

16:19.000 --> 16:21.000
Nice, Chicken and Breakout

16:21.000 --> 16:22.000
Yep

16:22.000 --> 16:23.000
Awesome

16:23.000 --> 16:24.000
I am done

16:24.000 --> 16:26.000
Loki, how was your day? How was your week?

16:26.000 --> 16:28.000
I'm tired

16:28.000 --> 16:29.000
I guess

16:29.000 --> 16:32.000
Today I painted baseboards because

16:32.000 --> 16:34.000
It needs to be done

16:34.000 --> 16:36.000
Because they're just primered white

16:36.000 --> 16:39.000
I mean they look white but when you paint them it's a different color white

16:39.000 --> 16:41.000
If that makes sense

16:41.000 --> 16:44.000
So that's what I did today because I have to work on the house stuff

16:44.000 --> 16:48.000
And then this week

16:48.000 --> 16:53.000
I was trying to perfect the perfect modifications to Grand Theft Auto 4

16:53.000 --> 16:55.000
And we have a working set now

16:55.000 --> 16:57.000
It's Absolute Chaos

16:57.000 --> 16:58.000
I mean

16:58.000 --> 17:02.000
There's explosions going off everywhere consistently

17:02.000 --> 17:06.000
Basically we replaced a bunch of the weapons in the game

17:06.000 --> 17:08.000
Starting with the

17:08.000 --> 17:12.000
Desert Eagle now is a gun that shoots these little

17:12.000 --> 17:14.000
Vortex

17:14.000 --> 17:17.000
Blasts I guess that basically throw people into the air

17:17.000 --> 17:20.000
Or cars or just whatever you fire it at

17:20.000 --> 17:22.000
And um

17:22.000 --> 17:24.000
So that was basically the first thing I created

17:24.000 --> 17:26.000
Which was like a defensive weapon

17:26.000 --> 17:27.000
And it works pretty good

17:27.000 --> 17:30.000
And then we replaced the um

17:30.000 --> 17:34.000
The Mac 11 with uh

17:34.000 --> 17:38.000
It's a molotov launcher that fires lots of fire at people

17:38.000 --> 17:41.000
And catches them on fire and cars on fire and you name it

17:41.000 --> 17:44.000
Then the MP5 which is the other Uzi in the game

17:44.000 --> 17:47.000
Now fires rapid fire grenades

17:47.000 --> 17:49.000
And um

17:49.000 --> 17:51.000
That just creates a ton of explosions

17:51.000 --> 17:54.000
And then we replaced the molotov in the game

17:54.000 --> 17:56.000
Because you get that in multiplayer still

17:56.000 --> 17:58.000
But since there's a molotov launcher already

17:58.000 --> 18:01.000
I just made it create this giant explosion

18:01.000 --> 18:03.000
That doesn't do any damage but throws everything everywhere

18:03.000 --> 18:05.000
So that's kind of fun

18:05.000 --> 18:07.000
Real quick question from chat let me ask this

18:07.000 --> 18:09.000
Chat.orangelandradio.com live on this Sunday evening

18:09.000 --> 18:12.000
Loki is there any way we can download your mods

18:12.000 --> 18:14.000
That's from SSG100 Matt

18:14.000 --> 18:17.000
No I'd have to post a copy of the ISO on there

18:17.000 --> 18:19.000
I guess I could post a copy of my modified files

18:19.000 --> 18:22.000
Then you just have to do the modifications yourself

18:22.000 --> 18:25.000
And then you'd have to build your own ISO

18:25.000 --> 18:28.000
And then burn it off and then play it on a modded 360

18:28.000 --> 18:30.000
But um

18:30.000 --> 18:31.000
Yeah I could do that

18:31.000 --> 18:33.000
But it's a lot of work

18:33.000 --> 18:35.000
And then um let's see what else I do

18:35.000 --> 18:37.000
Oh uh the

18:37.000 --> 18:40.000
The M4 now fires a bunch of rockets

18:40.000 --> 18:41.000
Which is kind of funny

18:41.000 --> 18:45.000
But they don't exactly explode on impact

18:45.000 --> 18:46.000
They just bounce around a lot

18:46.000 --> 18:47.000
Which is kind of funny

18:47.000 --> 18:50.000
And then um

18:50.000 --> 18:52.000
Let's see what else

18:52.000 --> 18:54.000
I think that's pretty much it as far as weapons go

18:54.000 --> 18:56.000
It's just it's a lot of chaos

18:56.000 --> 18:58.000
And then also the police car flies

18:58.000 --> 19:01.000
And um like the bus

19:01.000 --> 19:03.000
And the big vehicles basically are

19:03.000 --> 19:05.000
Um pretty dense

19:05.000 --> 19:07.000
And they'll crash through anything and go really fast

19:07.000 --> 19:10.000
So it's just it's really mixing up the game

19:10.000 --> 19:12.000
And it right now because I mean

19:12.000 --> 19:14.000
We've been playing Grand Theft Auto IV since it's come out

19:14.000 --> 19:16.000
And hell we've been playing Grand Theft Auto games

19:16.000 --> 19:18.000
Since they've come out on the PSP

19:18.000 --> 19:20.000
And they had multiplayer in them

19:20.000 --> 19:22.000
So um

19:22.000 --> 19:24.000
Yeah it's just it's really

19:24.000 --> 19:25.000
Really fun

19:25.000 --> 19:27.000
And I'm really looking forward to when they come out

19:27.000 --> 19:29.000
With the two expansions on one disc

19:29.000 --> 19:33.000
Like they're going to be doing sometime in I think October

19:33.000 --> 19:35.000
And uh when that happens it's going to be awesome

19:35.000 --> 19:37.000
Because not only will I be able to

19:37.000 --> 19:39.000
Because right now I can only modify the um

19:39.000 --> 19:41.000
Weapons that are part of the original game

19:41.000 --> 19:43.000
Like everything that's part of the expansion

19:43.000 --> 19:45.000
You can't modify because

19:45.000 --> 19:48.000
Basically it will overwrite anything

19:48.000 --> 19:50.000
With the stuff that's in the expansion

19:50.000 --> 19:52.000
Um that's on the disc

19:52.000 --> 19:54.000
And you can't modify the expansion

19:54.000 --> 19:56.000
Because it's in a different file format

19:56.000 --> 19:57.000
And that kind of thing

19:57.000 --> 19:59.000
But when it's on the actual disc

19:59.000 --> 20:01.000
Then yes then I can hack crap out of it

20:01.000 --> 20:04.000
And I'll be able to modify absolutely everything in the game

20:04.000 --> 20:07.000
Which will just be incredibly fun

20:07.000 --> 20:09.000
Um so beyond all that stuff

20:09.000 --> 20:11.000
Um I've been

20:11.000 --> 20:13.000
You know just kind of unpacking

20:13.000 --> 20:15.000
And

20:15.000 --> 20:17.000
I don't know

20:17.000 --> 20:19.000
I've really just been playing Grand Theft Auto this week

20:19.000 --> 20:21.000
Because I haven't had time to play much of anything else

20:21.000 --> 20:23.000
But I have Wii Sports Resort

20:23.000 --> 20:25.000
The Japanese one for Wii Motion Pluses now

20:25.000 --> 20:27.000
You were mentioning that the other day

20:27.000 --> 20:29.000
When you were over at my house for the birthday party

20:29.000 --> 20:31.000
And for some reason we never got around to playing it

20:31.000 --> 20:33.000
I guess just we were

20:33.000 --> 20:34.000
On other tangents or what have you

20:34.000 --> 20:36.000
But have you had a chance to crack it open and check it out yet?

20:36.000 --> 20:37.000
Nope

20:37.000 --> 20:38.000
Oh sad

20:38.000 --> 20:39.000
I don't know

20:39.000 --> 20:41.000
It's all in Japanese so I mean

20:41.000 --> 20:43.000
Well you should be able to crack your way through it though

20:43.000 --> 20:44.000
I mean uh

20:44.000 --> 20:45.000
Yeah

20:45.000 --> 20:46.000
When does that come out over here?

20:46.000 --> 20:48.000
In um July 26th

20:48.000 --> 20:50.000
Damn it's a bummer we weren't still in the old studio

20:50.000 --> 20:52.000
We could do a Justin TV thing

20:52.000 --> 20:53.000
Yeah

20:53.000 --> 20:54.000
We'll have to figure something out

20:54.000 --> 20:56.000
Or we can still get it broadcast somehow

20:56.000 --> 20:58.000
Kinda check that out before it's launched over here

20:58.000 --> 20:59.000
Yeah it's no big deal

20:59.000 --> 21:00.000
Yeah I mean

21:00.000 --> 21:01.000
I think

21:01.000 --> 21:04.000
With Wii Sports it's more a lot of people have a curiosity about Wii Sports

21:04.000 --> 21:06.000
That are actually like looking forward to it

21:06.000 --> 21:07.000
Have it pre-ordered

21:07.000 --> 21:08.000
I don't know

21:08.000 --> 21:09.000
I get the feeling our listener base

21:09.000 --> 21:12.000
More curious about it before they're gonna plop down that kind of money

21:12.000 --> 21:14.000
It's a good deal

21:14.000 --> 21:16.000
I mean the game's gonna be pretty decent

21:16.000 --> 21:18.000
And it's got 12 sports in it

21:18.000 --> 21:19.000
Plus you get Wii Motion Plus

21:19.000 --> 21:21.000
So I mean hey if the game sucks

21:21.000 --> 21:23.000
At least you have Wii Motion Plus

21:23.000 --> 21:27.000
And you know as much I had to buy my Wii Motion Pluses at GameStop

21:27.000 --> 21:30.000
Just because that's where I ended up turning it into my game

21:30.000 --> 21:31.000
So I had a lot of credit

21:31.000 --> 21:33.000
And it was just games that I've had for a while

21:33.000 --> 21:35.000
Or gotten free from work like

21:35.000 --> 21:37.000
Really I'm not gonna play UFC or you know

21:37.000 --> 21:39.000
I don't really give a crap about the Wheelman

21:39.000 --> 21:40.000
So

21:40.000 --> 21:42.000
Wait so the Wii Motion Plus is already out

21:42.000 --> 21:44.000
Yes Wii Motion Plus is already out

21:44.000 --> 21:45.000
Oh interesting

21:45.000 --> 21:46.000
Because uh

21:46.000 --> 21:47.000
There's nothing you can use it for

21:47.000 --> 21:48.000
No there's three games

21:48.000 --> 21:49.000
There's Tiger Woods 09

21:49.000 --> 21:51.000
There's um EA Sports Grand Slam Tennis

21:51.000 --> 21:53.000
And then there's also Virtua Tennis

21:53.000 --> 21:54.000
Okay

21:54.000 --> 21:56.000
2009 or 10 or whatever it is

21:56.000 --> 21:58.000
That's right I remember the Tiger Woods game now

21:58.000 --> 21:59.000
Cause that has some other feature doesn't it

21:59.000 --> 22:00.000
It doesn't that also have

22:00.000 --> 22:01.000
That's Frisbee Golf

22:01.000 --> 22:02.000
Is that the person that has the Facebook

22:02.000 --> 22:03.000
Or is that on Xbox

22:03.000 --> 22:04.000
Um

22:04.000 --> 22:05.000
That's on Xbox

22:05.000 --> 22:06.000
That's

22:06.000 --> 22:07.000
They're talking

22:07.000 --> 22:08.000
I think that was just more of an example

22:08.000 --> 22:10.000
That's not actually being done yet

22:10.000 --> 22:11.000
So much news

22:11.000 --> 22:12.000
Um

22:12.000 --> 22:13.000
No but you can actually

22:13.000 --> 22:16.000
Play Frisbee Golf and stuff in Tiger Woods

22:16.000 --> 22:17.000
2010

22:17.000 --> 22:18.000
So that's kinda cool

22:18.000 --> 22:19.000
And then

22:19.000 --> 22:21.000
Um

22:21.000 --> 22:22.000
Yeah but anyways

22:22.000 --> 22:23.000
So I bought mine at

22:23.000 --> 22:24.000
Um

22:24.000 --> 22:25.000
GameStop

22:25.000 --> 22:26.000
And if you aren't using trading credit

22:26.000 --> 22:27.000
Or you know

22:27.000 --> 22:28.000
Happen to getting

22:28.000 --> 22:29.000
You know free games that

22:29.000 --> 22:30.000
Are really old and crappy

22:30.000 --> 22:31.000
That

22:31.000 --> 22:33.000
You're just basically

22:33.000 --> 22:34.000
Pay with cash or something like that

22:34.000 --> 22:35.000
Don't go to GameStop

22:35.000 --> 22:36.000
Cause they're charging

22:36.000 --> 22:37.000
$5 over retail

22:37.000 --> 22:38.000
They're charging

22:38.000 --> 22:40.000
$25 for the Wii Motion Pluses

22:40.000 --> 22:41.000
They retail at

22:41.000 --> 22:42.000
$20

22:42.000 --> 22:43.000
They know it

22:43.000 --> 22:44.000
They just figure people are dumb

22:44.000 --> 22:45.000
And gonna buy it

22:45.000 --> 22:46.000
And yes I was dumb

22:46.000 --> 22:47.000
And bought it

22:47.000 --> 22:48.000
But the only reason I bought it there

22:48.000 --> 22:49.000
Was because

22:49.000 --> 22:50.000
It didn't really cost me anything

22:50.000 --> 22:51.000
Since I traded in

22:51.000 --> 22:52.000
Games I got for free

22:52.000 --> 22:53.000
So

22:53.000 --> 22:54.000
Who cares

22:54.000 --> 22:55.000
You know

22:55.000 --> 22:56.000
And really yeah

22:56.000 --> 22:57.000
I could have gone to GameCrazy

22:57.000 --> 22:58.000
Or something like that

22:58.000 --> 22:59.000
But

22:59.000 --> 23:00.000
I'm just not gonna drive the extra distance

23:00.000 --> 23:01.000
And then go to someplace else

23:01.000 --> 23:02.000
Other than GameStop

23:02.000 --> 23:03.000
So

23:03.000 --> 23:04.000
Who cares

23:04.000 --> 23:06.000
But I did buy the last two that they had

23:06.000 --> 23:07.000
So that was kinda cool

23:07.000 --> 23:08.000
Um

23:08.000 --> 23:10.000
And then I'm sure I'll eventually use them

23:10.000 --> 23:11.000
But

23:11.000 --> 23:14.000
I just haven't gotten around to it yet

23:14.000 --> 23:15.000
But uh

23:15.000 --> 23:16.000
Yeah

23:16.000 --> 23:17.000
Just that's pretty much

23:17.000 --> 23:18.000
I have a lot of games

23:18.000 --> 23:19.000
You know

23:19.000 --> 23:21.000
On deck I guess to play

23:21.000 --> 23:23.000
And I just haven't really

23:23.000 --> 23:24.000
Gotten to it yet

23:24.000 --> 23:26.000
But hopefully now I'm done messing with

23:26.000 --> 23:28.000
Grand Theft Auto 4 for a while

23:28.000 --> 23:31.000
Cause I've really modified all that I can modify right now

23:31.000 --> 23:32.000
Um

23:32.000 --> 23:34.000
That I even wanna mess with so

23:34.000 --> 23:35.000
That's

23:35.000 --> 23:36.000
Where I'm probably gonna leave that

23:36.000 --> 23:38.000
And then maybe I'll get into

23:38.000 --> 23:41.000
Red Faction Guerrilla or Arma 2 this week or something

23:43.000 --> 23:44.000
Alright

23:44.000 --> 23:45.000
Well let's see

23:45.000 --> 23:46.000
I'll start with games

23:46.000 --> 23:47.000
And get into personal stuff

23:47.000 --> 23:48.000
Um

23:48.000 --> 23:49.000
Let's see games I played this week

23:49.000 --> 23:50.000
I've still been playing Fuel

23:50.000 --> 23:51.000
I think I've played

23:51.000 --> 23:52.000
I think I've played Fuel more than Loki has now

23:52.000 --> 23:53.000
I know

23:53.000 --> 23:54.000
I'm really

23:54.000 --> 23:55.000
I keep wanting to go back to him

23:55.000 --> 23:56.000
I've unlocked four zones now

23:56.000 --> 23:57.000
Which is still nothing

23:57.000 --> 23:59.000
I mean there's like 19 zones

23:59.000 --> 24:00.000
There's

24:00.000 --> 24:01.000
There's a lot

24:01.000 --> 24:02.000
Of orange to peel

24:02.000 --> 24:03.000
In Fuel

24:03.000 --> 24:04.000
Uh

24:04.000 --> 24:05.000
The world is so vast

24:05.000 --> 24:06.000
How are the third and fourth zones

24:06.000 --> 24:07.000
Cause what's the third one they unlock

24:07.000 --> 24:08.000
Ah

24:08.000 --> 24:09.000
The

24:09.000 --> 24:10.000
It's in the middle

24:10.000 --> 24:11.000
The Dry Run I think

24:11.000 --> 24:12.000
Is the name of the third area or something

24:12.000 --> 24:13.000
It's kinda towards the middle

24:13.000 --> 24:14.000
It's to the right side of the first area

24:14.000 --> 24:15.000
Okay

24:15.000 --> 24:16.000
Uh

24:16.000 --> 24:17.000
And then you unlock a fourth area

24:17.000 --> 24:18.000
Right underneath that

24:18.000 --> 24:19.000
I actually haven't played a lot

24:19.000 --> 24:20.000
In the third and fourth areas

24:20.000 --> 24:21.000
Because I'm still obsessively collecting

24:21.000 --> 24:22.000
In the first two

24:22.000 --> 24:24.000
And I learned about this little trick

24:24.000 --> 24:25.000
That lets you use any car

24:25.000 --> 24:26.000
In any race

24:26.000 --> 24:27.000
If you hit the back button

24:27.000 --> 24:28.000
At just the right time

24:28.000 --> 24:29.000
When the race is about to start

24:29.000 --> 24:30.000
You can actually play

24:30.000 --> 24:31.000
SUV races with a bike

24:31.000 --> 24:32.000
And so on

24:32.000 --> 24:33.000
That's awesome

24:33.000 --> 24:34.000
So yeah

24:34.000 --> 24:35.000
I thought it was actually kinda cool

24:35.000 --> 24:36.000
Um

24:36.000 --> 24:37.000
It really helps in some of the races too

24:37.000 --> 24:38.000
I guess you could say it's cheating

24:38.000 --> 24:39.000
But whatever

24:39.000 --> 24:40.000
Who cares

24:40.000 --> 24:41.000
It's a glitch in the game

24:41.000 --> 24:42.000
It's a silly game

24:42.000 --> 24:43.000
You know

24:43.000 --> 24:44.000
I don't think Fuel should be taken

24:44.000 --> 24:45.000
seriously

24:45.000 --> 24:46.000
But it's

24:46.000 --> 24:47.000
It's big dumb stupid fun

24:47.000 --> 24:48.000
Um

24:48.000 --> 24:49.000
And the world

24:49.000 --> 24:50.000
The world really is huge

24:50.000 --> 24:51.000
Like you just

24:51.000 --> 24:52.000
I can see though

24:52.000 --> 24:53.000
Some of the reviews I've read say

24:53.000 --> 24:54.000
You know

24:54.000 --> 24:55.000
And I've talked about this game

24:55.000 --> 24:56.000
It's probably going to my third week

24:56.000 --> 24:57.000
Talking about this game

24:57.000 --> 24:58.000
I don't wanna kinda

24:58.000 --> 24:59.000
Reinvent the wheel here

24:59.000 --> 25:00.000
But I think one of the most common

25:00.000 --> 25:02.000
Negative things I've read in reviews

25:02.000 --> 25:03.000
Is that

25:03.000 --> 25:05.000
Yeah you have this big open world

25:05.000 --> 25:06.000
But full of what

25:06.000 --> 25:08.000
There's really not a lot in it

25:08.000 --> 25:09.000
And I think

25:09.000 --> 25:10.000
I kind of am getting

25:10.000 --> 25:12.000
Getting to understand that point of view

25:12.000 --> 25:13.000
A little more

25:13.000 --> 25:14.000
I do find this game fun

25:14.000 --> 25:16.000
I think a lot of the courses are pretty cool

25:16.000 --> 25:18.000
There isn't a lot that really is

25:18.000 --> 25:20.000
But at least in the first few areas

25:20.000 --> 25:21.000
Have you gotten to any of the like

25:21.000 --> 25:23.000
Weather things like tornadoes and stuff

25:23.000 --> 25:24.000
Not the tornadoes and stuff

25:24.000 --> 25:25.000
So that's where I'm hoping

25:25.000 --> 25:26.000
I've seen

25:26.000 --> 25:27.000
I've seen some screenshots of that

25:27.000 --> 25:28.000
And that looks crazy

25:28.000 --> 25:30.000
I did do a heavy wind type race

25:30.000 --> 25:32.000
But all that did was kind of decrease my visibility

25:32.000 --> 25:34.000
And put this weird filter on that just made it look like

25:34.000 --> 25:36.000
Stuff was blowing in front of my car

25:36.000 --> 25:37.000
And everything the whole time

25:37.000 --> 25:38.000
It was

25:38.000 --> 25:39.000
I don't know

25:39.000 --> 25:40.000
Like

25:40.000 --> 25:41.000
I

25:41.000 --> 25:42.000
It's hard to recommend this game for

25:42.000 --> 25:43.000
$60

25:43.000 --> 25:44.000
But at the same time

25:44.000 --> 25:45.000
I can't put it down

25:45.000 --> 25:46.000
Like I don't know why

25:46.000 --> 25:48.000
Like I'm obsessively collecting all the vista points

25:48.000 --> 25:49.000
And all this stuff

25:49.000 --> 25:52.000
Maybe it's because I'm not playing MMOs right now

25:52.000 --> 25:54.000
But there's that MMO driving me

25:54.000 --> 25:56.000
To obsessively collect things

25:56.000 --> 25:58.000
That I don't really need

25:58.000 --> 25:59.000
So here I am trying to

25:59.000 --> 26:00.000
Like I've unlocked an achievement now

26:00.000 --> 26:01.000
For getting 10 vista points

26:01.000 --> 26:03.000
I think I'm up to like 12 vista points

26:03.000 --> 26:04.000
And for some reason

26:04.000 --> 26:06.000
That's like my big goal in this game right now

26:06.000 --> 26:07.000
Is like okay

26:07.000 --> 26:08.000
I gotta play the arcade races

26:08.000 --> 26:09.000
Until I can get the doppler truck

26:09.000 --> 26:10.000
That I can run into

26:10.000 --> 26:11.000
To get the vista points

26:11.000 --> 26:12.000
Because I want all the vista points

26:12.000 --> 26:15.000
Because that's supposed to be the prettiest areas in the game

26:15.000 --> 26:16.000
I'll tell you what

26:16.000 --> 26:17.000
There is some neat stuff

26:17.000 --> 26:18.000
Like one of the vista points

26:18.000 --> 26:19.000
You remember how last week you were talking about

26:19.000 --> 26:20.000
That you drive through

26:20.000 --> 26:21.000
Like a forest fire

26:21.000 --> 26:22.000
To get to one of the zones

26:22.000 --> 26:23.000
Yeah

26:23.000 --> 26:24.000
Well one of the vista points is like

26:24.000 --> 26:26.000
On a hill overlooking that fire

26:26.000 --> 26:27.000
So it's kinda neat

26:27.000 --> 26:28.000
Huh

26:28.000 --> 26:29.000
You usually have some really interesting areas

26:29.000 --> 26:30.000
So

26:30.000 --> 26:31.000
Um

26:31.000 --> 26:32.000
Yeah

26:32.000 --> 26:33.000
You know

26:33.000 --> 26:34.000
It's such a hit and miss game

26:34.000 --> 26:36.000
If you like arcade racers

26:36.000 --> 26:37.000
Like I do

26:37.000 --> 26:38.000
Like just big dumb stupid fun

26:38.000 --> 26:40.000
I think you will get a kick out of this game

26:40.000 --> 26:42.000
But I think fans of more realistic racers

26:42.000 --> 26:44.000
Are gonna get driven nuts by this game

26:44.000 --> 26:46.000
I will tell you the one thing that does drive me nuts

26:46.000 --> 26:47.000
I installed fuel to my hard drive

26:47.000 --> 26:49.000
And I think it's causing more crashes

26:49.000 --> 26:50.000
Than ought to be there

26:50.000 --> 26:51.000
Is that um

26:51.000 --> 26:53.000
Like sometimes after I do a challenge

26:53.000 --> 26:55.000
If I do a challenge right out of the camp

26:55.000 --> 26:56.000
The game locks up on me

26:56.000 --> 26:58.000
When I try to go back to free run

26:58.000 --> 26:59.000
Really

26:59.000 --> 27:00.000
The loading times are just

27:00.000 --> 27:02.000
A little silly

27:02.000 --> 27:03.000
You know you

27:03.000 --> 27:04.000
You have to wait

27:04.000 --> 27:05.000
When you move to a camp

27:05.000 --> 27:07.000
And then when you load for the race

27:07.000 --> 27:08.000
And then when you

27:08.000 --> 27:09.000
You know

27:09.000 --> 27:10.000
It's just like

27:10.000 --> 27:11.000
I'm having to do a lot of unnecessary load times

27:11.000 --> 27:13.000
Well the load times I think

27:13.000 --> 27:14.000
For the races and stuff

27:14.000 --> 27:15.000
Is because it's

27:15.000 --> 27:17.000
Like warping you to a different part of the map

27:17.000 --> 27:18.000
I get that

27:18.000 --> 27:19.000
But why does it have to reload

27:19.000 --> 27:21.000
When I change from one camp to another

27:21.000 --> 27:23.000
If it's just a new menu

27:23.000 --> 27:24.000
If I'm not gonna

27:24.000 --> 27:25.000
Like

27:25.000 --> 27:26.000
If I'm not gonna exit that menu

27:26.000 --> 27:27.000
Well it

27:27.000 --> 27:29.000
It's loading the actual area of the arc

27:29.000 --> 27:30.000
Cause when you exit the menu

27:30.000 --> 27:31.000
It doesn't have any load time

27:31.000 --> 27:32.000
I don't think

27:32.000 --> 27:33.000
Um

27:33.000 --> 27:34.000
It just seems weird

27:34.000 --> 27:35.000
The loading times are weird

27:35.000 --> 27:36.000
But honestly you know

27:36.000 --> 27:37.000
I don't

27:37.000 --> 27:38.000
It's not a perfect game

27:38.000 --> 27:39.000
It's

27:39.000 --> 27:40.000
I'm

27:40.000 --> 27:41.000
I am having fun with it

27:41.000 --> 27:42.000
And I think that's what's most important

27:42.000 --> 27:43.000
At the bottom line

27:43.000 --> 27:44.000
I can be as critical as I want

27:44.000 --> 27:45.000
Of a video game on these

27:45.000 --> 27:46.000
You know

27:46.000 --> 27:47.000
I've driven right through a tree

27:47.000 --> 27:48.000
Like

27:48.000 --> 27:49.000
There are some very big

27:49.000 --> 27:51.000
Glaring bugs in this game

27:51.000 --> 27:52.000
But I don't know

27:52.000 --> 27:53.000
Yet I still have fun

27:53.000 --> 27:54.000
Collecting all the stuff

27:54.000 --> 27:55.000
I wish there was like a trick system

27:55.000 --> 27:56.000
Or something in that

27:56.000 --> 27:58.000
It's fun to drive the motorcycles too

27:58.000 --> 27:59.000
Like you know

27:59.000 --> 28:01.000
And despite the fact that there's this big world

28:01.000 --> 28:02.000
Practically full of nothing

28:02.000 --> 28:03.000
There are like these houses

28:03.000 --> 28:04.000
That will have ramps on them

28:04.000 --> 28:05.000
And you can like

28:05.000 --> 28:06.000
Drive up the ramp

28:06.000 --> 28:07.000
And fly off the house

28:07.000 --> 28:08.000
And you're flying over the trees

28:08.000 --> 28:10.000
There is some silly fun

28:10.000 --> 28:11.000
Well all those ramp houses

28:11.000 --> 28:12.000
Have like fuel on top of them

28:12.000 --> 28:14.000
That you have to stop and get

28:14.000 --> 28:15.000
Yeah

28:15.000 --> 28:16.000
I usually don't stop for fuel

28:16.000 --> 28:17.000
Like I'll try to run into it

28:17.000 --> 28:18.000
If I'm driving by it

28:18.000 --> 28:19.000
But otherwise

28:19.000 --> 28:20.000
Yeah

28:20.000 --> 28:21.000
It's funny when I play on Xbox Live

28:21.000 --> 28:22.000
And turn Xbox Live on

28:22.000 --> 28:23.000
There's like nobody around

28:23.000 --> 28:24.000
Anywhere

28:24.000 --> 28:25.000
Just because

28:25.000 --> 28:27.000
I'm surprised they don't have a way

28:27.000 --> 28:28.000
To turn that on by default

28:28.000 --> 28:30.000
I think more people would be using it

28:30.000 --> 28:31.000
If it was like Test Drive

28:31.000 --> 28:32.000
Where it was on by default

28:32.000 --> 28:34.000
You know what I mean

28:34.000 --> 28:35.000
Yeah

28:35.000 --> 28:36.000
Um

28:36.000 --> 28:37.000
Let's see

28:37.000 --> 28:38.000
Other games I've been playing this week

28:38.000 --> 28:39.000
Magic the Gathering

28:39.000 --> 28:40.000
I actually bought

28:40.000 --> 28:41.000
Magic the Gathering on Xbox Live

28:41.000 --> 28:42.000
Despite our little story

28:42.000 --> 28:43.000
About it last week

28:43.000 --> 28:44.000
And all the fun

28:44.000 --> 28:45.000
I know

28:45.000 --> 28:46.000
Dark Soccer is holding up the cards

28:46.000 --> 28:47.000
We still have to have our duel

28:47.000 --> 28:48.000
But you see

28:48.000 --> 28:49.000
I need to remember how to play again

28:49.000 --> 28:51.000
So that's why I downloaded the Xbox Live version

28:51.000 --> 28:52.000
That was the little point

28:52.000 --> 28:53.000
That we were going to play

28:53.000 --> 28:54.000
Unpracticed

28:54.000 --> 28:55.000
Oh my bad

28:55.000 --> 28:56.000
Well I couldn't resist

28:56.000 --> 28:57.000
I had to check it out

28:57.000 --> 28:58.000
But um

28:58.000 --> 28:59.000
Yeah

28:59.000 --> 29:00.000
I mean

29:00.000 --> 29:01.000
If you like the card game

29:01.000 --> 29:03.000
It's a fairly faithful reinterpretation

29:03.000 --> 29:04.000
I don't know

29:04.000 --> 29:05.000
I

29:05.000 --> 29:06.000
I still think

29:06.000 --> 29:07.000
Nothing beats

29:07.000 --> 29:08.000
The actual cards

29:08.000 --> 29:09.000
For a card game

29:09.000 --> 29:10.000
But

29:10.000 --> 29:11.000
I guess they did a pretty good job

29:11.000 --> 29:12.000
With the translation

29:12.000 --> 29:13.000
I mean

29:13.000 --> 29:14.000
You know what

29:14.000 --> 29:15.000
Uno

29:15.000 --> 29:16.000
I could make the same argument there

29:16.000 --> 29:17.000
Uno's a card game

29:17.000 --> 29:18.000
But it's still kind of fun on Xbox Live

29:18.000 --> 29:19.000
Because you have the camera and everything

29:19.000 --> 29:20.000
And I was surprised

29:20.000 --> 29:22.000
Magic the Gathering has the camera built in too

29:22.000 --> 29:23.000
I didn't realize that

29:23.000 --> 29:24.000
So hooray

29:24.000 --> 29:25.000
A game I can get used to

29:25.000 --> 29:26.000
Out of my Xbox Live camera

29:26.000 --> 29:27.000
I'm excited

29:27.000 --> 29:28.000
Um

29:28.000 --> 29:29.000
But yeah

29:29.000 --> 29:30.000
The game itself

29:30.000 --> 29:31.000
I suck at it

29:31.000 --> 29:33.000
But I was able to at least beat the first guy

29:33.000 --> 29:34.000
And uh

29:34.000 --> 29:35.000
You know

29:35.000 --> 29:36.000
It's cool

29:36.000 --> 29:38.000
I was having a problem figuring out how to edit my deck though

29:38.000 --> 29:39.000
It wasn't

29:39.000 --> 29:40.000
It's not very intuitive in that regard

29:40.000 --> 29:43.000
And I'm not looking forward to all the microtransactions

29:43.000 --> 29:44.000
That I'm sure are to come with this

29:44.000 --> 29:45.000
But

29:45.000 --> 29:46.000
You know what

29:46.000 --> 29:47.000
For what it is

29:47.000 --> 29:48.000
And considering it's only ten bucks

29:48.000 --> 29:51.000
When the card game itself can start to cost you a lot more

29:51.000 --> 29:52.000
Very quickly

29:52.000 --> 29:53.000
Uh

29:53.000 --> 29:54.000
It's worth checking out

29:54.000 --> 29:55.000
You know

29:55.000 --> 29:56.000
They did put together the game very well

29:56.000 --> 29:57.000
And for

29:57.000 --> 29:59.000
A very freaking complicated card game

29:59.000 --> 30:00.000
I mean

30:00.000 --> 30:01.000
Face it

30:01.000 --> 30:02.000
Magic the Gathering is complicated

30:02.000 --> 30:03.000
And I think it says it best

30:03.000 --> 30:04.000
In the

30:04.000 --> 30:05.000
In the rules

30:05.000 --> 30:07.000
That come up for some of the tournaments

30:07.000 --> 30:09.000
In the Magic the Gathering game

30:09.000 --> 30:10.000
Magic the Gathering

30:10.000 --> 30:11.000
One of its unique features

30:11.000 --> 30:12.000
Is that the cards

30:12.000 --> 30:13.000
At one time or another

30:13.000 --> 30:15.000
Break all the rules

30:15.000 --> 30:16.000
All the rules can be broken

30:16.000 --> 30:17.000
With the cards

30:17.000 --> 30:18.000
In one way or another

30:18.000 --> 30:20.000
That's what makes the game somewhat unique

30:20.000 --> 30:21.000
And

30:21.000 --> 30:22.000
To take that

30:22.000 --> 30:23.000
And have to translate it

30:23.000 --> 30:24.000
Into a video game

30:24.000 --> 30:26.000
Into a logical flow chart

30:26.000 --> 30:27.000
That relies on

30:27.000 --> 30:28.000
Set rules

30:28.000 --> 30:29.000
That cannot be broken

30:29.000 --> 30:31.000
That's a pretty tough thing to accomplish

30:31.000 --> 30:32.000
And they did a pretty good job

30:32.000 --> 30:35.000
I did notice it did seem to flow a lot better

30:35.000 --> 30:38.000
Than the old, old PC game

30:38.000 --> 30:39.000
Which wasn't bad

30:39.000 --> 30:40.000
I had a lot of fun with that

30:40.000 --> 30:42.000
But it did seem like the game mechanic itself

30:42.000 --> 30:44.000
Flew a lot better in Xbox Live

30:44.000 --> 30:45.000
So I didn't play it enough

30:45.000 --> 30:46.000
I need to play it more

30:46.000 --> 30:47.000
But um

30:47.000 --> 30:48.000
Early for

30:48.000 --> 30:49.000
For an early review

30:49.000 --> 30:50.000
I will say

30:50.000 --> 30:51.000
I had a lot more fun with it

30:51.000 --> 30:53.000
Than I was expecting to

30:53.000 --> 30:54.000
As far as how was my week

30:54.000 --> 30:55.000
How was my day

30:55.000 --> 30:56.000
Um

30:56.000 --> 30:57.000
Today was kind of neat

30:57.000 --> 30:59.000
I went to Pride in San Francisco

30:59.000 --> 31:00.000
Which is you know

31:00.000 --> 31:01.000
Of course the big gay Pride parade there

31:01.000 --> 31:02.000
They do every year in San Francisco

31:02.000 --> 31:05.000
I used to not be a fan of gay Pride actually

31:05.000 --> 31:06.000
Um

31:06.000 --> 31:09.000
Because I hate how the media will show that

31:09.000 --> 31:11.000
And that is the impression unfortunately

31:11.000 --> 31:13.000
That a lot of folks out there have of gay people

31:13.000 --> 31:15.000
Is that we're all drag queens

31:15.000 --> 31:18.000
And we all like to run around in our g-strings

31:18.000 --> 31:19.000
Uh

31:19.000 --> 31:20.000
And you know assless leather chaps

31:20.000 --> 31:22.000
You know wearing nothing but handcuffs

31:22.000 --> 31:23.000
Um

31:23.000 --> 31:24.000
And that is so not true

31:24.000 --> 31:25.000
And uh

31:25.000 --> 31:26.000
Definitely not me

31:26.000 --> 31:27.000
Okay

31:27.000 --> 31:28.000
That's for sure

31:28.000 --> 31:29.000
Uh

31:29.000 --> 31:30.000
Hey I don't have the body for that

31:30.000 --> 31:31.000
So uh

31:31.000 --> 31:32.000
You can thank yourselves ahead of time for that

31:32.000 --> 31:33.000
And B

31:33.000 --> 31:34.000
It's just not really you know

31:34.000 --> 31:36.000
Sure I've done Rocky Horror Picture Show

31:36.000 --> 31:37.000
For a long time

31:37.000 --> 31:38.000
But the rest of that

31:38.000 --> 31:39.000
You know the

31:39.000 --> 31:41.000
The big stuff they do out there

31:41.000 --> 31:42.000
I don't know

31:42.000 --> 31:43.000
It's just not me

31:43.000 --> 31:44.000
And I don't like the fact that it's

31:44.000 --> 31:45.000
The impression that some people get

31:45.000 --> 31:46.000
Because some people are naive

31:46.000 --> 31:48.000
So I used to kind of have a problem with it

31:48.000 --> 31:49.000
Because it was so excessive

31:49.000 --> 31:50.000
But let me tell you this

31:50.000 --> 31:52.000
In straight culture there's a lot of

31:52.000 --> 31:53.000
Excessive stuff as well

31:53.000 --> 31:54.000
I mean think about it

31:54.000 --> 31:56.000
Pride is no different from

31:56.000 --> 31:58.000
A Playboy mansion party

31:58.000 --> 32:00.000
The girls next door

32:00.000 --> 32:02.000
MTV's Spring Break

32:02.000 --> 32:03.000
Thank you very much

32:03.000 --> 32:06.000
How is that any worse than what goes on at Gay Pride?

32:06.000 --> 32:08.000
It's really not

32:08.000 --> 32:09.000
MTV's Spring Break is just as bad

32:09.000 --> 32:11.000
As anything you're going to see in San Francisco

32:11.000 --> 32:13.000
It's really

32:13.000 --> 32:15.000
I mean I haven't been to the parade there

32:15.000 --> 32:17.000
But I've been to the Castro Street Fair

32:17.000 --> 32:20.000
Which I've heard has almost a similar reputation

32:20.000 --> 32:22.000
And it was really

32:22.000 --> 32:24.000
Not that crazy

32:24.000 --> 32:25.000
There was some crazy

32:25.000 --> 32:26.000
It's not that shocking

32:26.000 --> 32:27.000
No it's just

32:27.000 --> 32:28.000
So you might see

32:28.000 --> 32:29.000
A topless lesbian

32:29.000 --> 32:30.000
Oh my gosh

32:30.000 --> 32:31.000
You see those in France

32:31.000 --> 32:32.000
Walking down the street

32:32.000 --> 32:33.000
You know

32:33.000 --> 32:34.000
I saw a couple of dudes

32:34.000 --> 32:35.000
Running around in some tight shorts

32:35.000 --> 32:36.000
But you know

32:36.000 --> 32:37.000
Topless lesbian

32:37.000 --> 32:38.000
Sweet

32:38.000 --> 32:39.000
Who?

32:39.000 --> 32:40.000
Brigitte Nielsen?

32:40.000 --> 32:41.000
No

32:41.000 --> 32:42.000
You know what

32:42.000 --> 32:44.000
And then I always see that argument

32:44.000 --> 32:45.000
What about straight pride?

32:45.000 --> 32:47.000
Well I mean like MTV's Spring Break

32:47.000 --> 32:49.000
Is a little bit of straight pride

32:49.000 --> 32:50.000
I think in a way

32:50.000 --> 32:51.000
But also I don't think pride

32:51.000 --> 32:53.000
Necessarily has to do with

32:53.000 --> 32:54.000
Just being gay

32:54.000 --> 32:56.000
I think it's about just being different

32:56.000 --> 32:57.000
At all

32:57.000 --> 32:58.000
Just being

32:58.000 --> 32:59.000
Just being

32:59.000 --> 33:00.000
Out and proud

33:00.000 --> 33:01.000
That doesn't necessarily mean

33:01.000 --> 33:02.000
Out of the closet

33:02.000 --> 33:03.000
And all that

33:03.000 --> 33:04.000
It just means

33:04.000 --> 33:05.000
You are who you are

33:05.000 --> 33:06.000
And you're damn proud of it

33:06.000 --> 33:07.000
And the hell with what other people think

33:07.000 --> 33:09.000
So I've come a long way

33:09.000 --> 33:10.000
In kind of accepting gay pride

33:10.000 --> 33:12.000
As part of the gay culture

33:12.000 --> 33:14.000
And I don't feel the gay shame

33:14.000 --> 33:15.000
That I used to

33:15.000 --> 33:17.000
I actually do still agree though

33:17.000 --> 33:18.000
With Patton Oswalt

33:18.000 --> 33:20.000
Is that the gay pride parade

33:20.000 --> 33:24.000
Should actually tour from state to state

33:24.000 --> 33:25.000
And go everywhere

33:25.000 --> 33:26.000
Instead of just the cities

33:26.000 --> 33:27.000
Where you're not really shocked

33:27.000 --> 33:29.000
By it existing

33:29.000 --> 33:31.000
Like Tuscaloosa

33:31.000 --> 33:32.000
Nice

33:32.000 --> 33:33.000
So yeah

33:33.000 --> 33:34.000
I did that today

33:34.000 --> 33:35.000
And that was cool

33:35.000 --> 33:36.000
Except for having to stand out

33:36.000 --> 33:38.000
In the blaring sun for like two hours

33:38.000 --> 33:39.000
Less cool

33:39.000 --> 33:41.000
But you're in San Francisco?

33:41.000 --> 33:42.000
It still was hot

33:42.000 --> 33:43.000
I mean even though it's San Francisco

33:43.000 --> 33:44.000
Right by the ocean

33:44.000 --> 33:45.000
You have a nice breeze

33:45.000 --> 33:46.000
It was still hot

33:46.000 --> 33:47.000
What was kind of cool

33:47.000 --> 33:48.000
Speaking of hot

33:48.000 --> 33:50.000
Gavin Newsom walked right by us

33:50.000 --> 33:51.000
He was like right there

33:51.000 --> 33:52.000
And Victoria

33:52.000 --> 33:54.000
Who hasn't been on the show in a long time

33:54.000 --> 33:55.000
Gavin Newsom

33:55.000 --> 33:56.000
He's the mayor of San Francisco

33:56.000 --> 33:58.000
And he's going to be running for governor

33:58.000 --> 34:01.000
In 2010

34:01.000 --> 34:02.000
He walked right by

34:02.000 --> 34:03.000
And Victoria exclaimed

34:03.000 --> 34:04.000
Oh my god he's even hotter in person

34:04.000 --> 34:06.000
I was thinking of someone else for some reason

34:06.000 --> 34:09.000
No he's very controversial

34:09.000 --> 34:10.000
But anyway

34:10.000 --> 34:11.000
I'm not going to get into politics too much in there

34:11.000 --> 34:13.000
But it was just kind of cool to see

34:13.000 --> 34:15.000
Someone that a lot of people know

34:15.000 --> 34:17.000
Right there

34:17.000 --> 34:18.000
Let's see

34:18.000 --> 34:20.000
The rest of my week outside of today

34:20.000 --> 34:21.000
I'm going to be honest

34:21.000 --> 34:23.000
I've had a very

34:23.000 --> 34:24.000
Bipolar week

34:24.000 --> 34:26.000
I've had a weird weird week

34:26.000 --> 34:28.000
My birthday was Friday

34:28.000 --> 34:29.000
Which was cool

34:29.000 --> 34:30.000
Because you know

34:30.000 --> 34:31.000
I got to see friends

34:31.000 --> 34:32.000
And hang out with folks

34:32.000 --> 34:33.000
And had a party

34:33.000 --> 34:34.000
Which oddly

34:34.000 --> 34:35.000
It's the first party I've had in like a year

34:35.000 --> 34:37.000
Where rock band and sing star

34:37.000 --> 34:38.000
Did not make an appearance

34:38.000 --> 34:39.000
And I had it in my car

34:39.000 --> 34:40.000
Shocking

34:40.000 --> 34:41.000
Right

34:41.000 --> 34:42.000
But I don't know what happened

34:42.000 --> 34:44.000
I think just everybody was just kind of into

34:44.000 --> 34:45.000
Just talking

34:45.000 --> 34:46.000
And you know

34:46.000 --> 34:48.000
The TV just hardly ever got turned on

34:48.000 --> 34:49.000
But for music

34:49.000 --> 34:50.000
On the cable music channels

34:50.000 --> 34:51.000
So it was just kind of like

34:51.000 --> 34:52.000
You know

34:52.000 --> 34:53.000
Just kind of a different type of party

34:53.000 --> 34:54.000
Which was cool

34:54.000 --> 34:55.000
Um

34:55.000 --> 34:56.000
Let's see

34:56.000 --> 34:57.000
And um

34:57.000 --> 34:58.000
As far as the rest of my week

34:58.000 --> 34:59.000
Okay look

34:59.000 --> 35:00.000
Like

35:00.000 --> 35:02.000
What a crazy week it's been

35:02.000 --> 35:03.000
Like um

35:03.000 --> 35:05.000
Especially if you're a Hollywood celebrity

35:05.000 --> 35:06.000
Right now

35:06.000 --> 35:07.000
Right

35:07.000 --> 35:08.000
And you might be wondering like

35:08.000 --> 35:10.000
I wonder if OLR is going to be doing a tribute tonight

35:10.000 --> 35:11.000
To uh

35:11.000 --> 35:12.000
The uh

35:12.000 --> 35:13.000
Uh

35:13.000 --> 35:14.000
Michael Jackson

35:14.000 --> 35:15.000
Or Farrah Fawcett

35:15.000 --> 35:16.000
Or Ed McMahon

35:16.000 --> 35:17.000
Or that infomercial guy

35:17.000 --> 35:18.000
What was his name

35:18.000 --> 35:19.000
Was that the Sham Wow guy

35:19.000 --> 35:20.000
Billy Mays

35:20.000 --> 35:21.000
Billy Mays

35:21.000 --> 35:22.000
I don't

35:22.000 --> 35:23.000
Obviously I don't follow this stuff

35:23.000 --> 35:25.000
I don't stay up late enough

35:25.000 --> 35:26.000
Um

35:26.000 --> 35:27.000
But okay so he passed away

35:27.000 --> 35:29.000
But see I've had a lot more weighing on my mind this week

35:29.000 --> 35:30.000
Because um

35:30.000 --> 35:32.000
Somebody I actually know

35:32.000 --> 35:33.000
Who I don't

35:33.000 --> 35:36.000
And one of the first questions I got asked about this was

35:36.000 --> 35:37.000
Has she been on the show before

35:37.000 --> 35:38.000
I don't believe she has

35:38.000 --> 35:39.000
Um

35:39.000 --> 35:40.000
Even in the few many years of the show

35:40.000 --> 35:41.000
I think a lot of people

35:41.000 --> 35:42.000
Um

35:42.000 --> 35:43.000
That are on the show know of her

35:43.000 --> 35:44.000
Um

35:44.000 --> 35:45.000
Her name was Beth

35:45.000 --> 35:47.000
And she passed away on Tuesday

35:47.000 --> 35:50.000
Which sadly was also the anniversary of the show

35:50.000 --> 35:51.000
And uh

35:51.000 --> 35:52.000
She passed away from swine flu

35:52.000 --> 35:54.000
Or H1N1 virus

35:54.000 --> 35:56.000
She'd been in the hospital for 11 days

35:56.000 --> 35:57.000
And uh

35:57.000 --> 35:58.000
Unfortunately used to come to

35:58.000 --> 35:59.000
Um

35:59.000 --> 36:00.000
Complications of swine flu

36:00.000 --> 36:01.000
Basically her

36:01.000 --> 36:02.000
I don't want to get into

36:02.000 --> 36:03.000
Gory detail

36:03.000 --> 36:04.000
But you know her kidneys failed

36:04.000 --> 36:05.000
Her lungs failed

36:05.000 --> 36:06.000
It just

36:06.000 --> 36:07.000
She was brain dead

36:07.000 --> 36:08.000
And that was the end of it

36:08.000 --> 36:09.000
So they um

36:09.000 --> 36:11.000
You know had to do what they did there

36:11.000 --> 36:12.000
And um

36:12.000 --> 36:15.000
It was just kind of the whole things kind of weird

36:15.000 --> 36:17.000
I don't really know how else to explain it

36:17.000 --> 36:18.000
Surreal

36:18.000 --> 36:19.000
It's very surreal

36:19.000 --> 36:20.000
I haven't really

36:20.000 --> 36:23.000
You know I'm not going to proclaim that I was Beth's BFF in the world

36:23.000 --> 36:25.000
But I really respected this woman

36:25.000 --> 36:28.000
And I saw what a motherly figure she was to all her gays

36:28.000 --> 36:29.000
And just people in general

36:29.000 --> 36:30.000
Not just the gays

36:30.000 --> 36:31.000
But you know people in general

36:31.000 --> 36:34.000
And just you know what an accepting fun person she was

36:34.000 --> 36:36.000
She was always like the type that lit up a room

36:36.000 --> 36:37.000
One thing I will never forget about Beth

36:37.000 --> 36:40.000
Is she was the first person to tell me

36:40.000 --> 36:42.000
When I was dating a certain ex of mine

36:42.000 --> 36:44.000
She was the first person to tell me

36:44.000 --> 36:45.000
You can do better than that

36:45.000 --> 36:47.000
Rob you can do better than that

36:47.000 --> 36:48.000
And

36:48.000 --> 36:49.000
She was right

36:49.000 --> 36:52.000
That's just her motherly instinct in her

36:52.000 --> 36:53.000
And um

36:53.000 --> 36:55.000
You know we lost a really great person this week

36:55.000 --> 36:58.000
To something we don't really understand

36:58.000 --> 37:00.000
Which is so weird

37:00.000 --> 37:01.000
Because you know

37:01.000 --> 37:03.000
And so many people have made fun of swine flu

37:03.000 --> 37:04.000
Myself included

37:04.000 --> 37:05.000
And just like

37:05.000 --> 37:07.000
Oh the media is blowing out of proportion

37:07.000 --> 37:08.000
It's this big epidemic

37:08.000 --> 37:09.000
And you know

37:09.000 --> 37:11.000
It's pandemic level six

37:11.000 --> 37:12.000
And all this stuff

37:12.000 --> 37:13.000
And you know a lot of us are kind of like

37:13.000 --> 37:15.000
Well more people die of the real flu

37:15.000 --> 37:16.000
But

37:16.000 --> 37:18.000
All it takes is one

37:18.000 --> 37:19.000
To really affect you

37:19.000 --> 37:20.000
And uh

37:20.000 --> 37:21.000
You know

37:21.000 --> 37:22.000
Whether she was

37:22.000 --> 37:24.000
She was the first person in Sacramento County

37:24.000 --> 37:25.000
To die

37:25.000 --> 37:27.000
Of H1N1

37:27.000 --> 37:28.000
And it's

37:28.000 --> 37:31.000
We still cannot comprehend the impact

37:31.000 --> 37:33.000
They're having a memorial for her next month

37:33.000 --> 37:34.000
July 25th

37:34.000 --> 37:36.000
And there's a part of me in my mind

37:36.000 --> 37:37.000
That

37:37.000 --> 37:38.000
I don't

37:38.000 --> 37:41.000
I'm treating this like a four year old deals with death

37:41.000 --> 37:43.000
I'm like literally thinking in my mind

37:43.000 --> 37:45.000
We're gonna go have a party

37:45.000 --> 37:46.000
We're gonna go hang with Beth

37:46.000 --> 37:48.000
They're throwing a fat party at Beth's house

37:48.000 --> 37:49.000
It's gonna rock

37:49.000 --> 37:50.000
But like

37:50.000 --> 37:52.000
There's a part of me that still doesn't get

37:52.000 --> 37:54.000
That she's like not here

37:54.000 --> 37:55.000
You know

37:55.000 --> 37:58.000
Because I think it's something that nobody understands

37:58.000 --> 37:59.000
Like H1N1

37:59.000 --> 38:01.000
That I'm not able to wrap my head around it this week

38:01.000 --> 38:02.000
So

38:02.000 --> 38:05.000
I apologize if I'm not

38:05.000 --> 38:07.000
As sympathetic to some of these celebrities

38:07.000 --> 38:09.000
That have passed on this week

38:09.000 --> 38:10.000
Folks that have contributed

38:10.000 --> 38:11.000
I don't think anyone blames you

38:11.000 --> 38:13.000
Well folks that have contributed great things to popular culture

38:13.000 --> 38:15.000
And so forth, etc

38:15.000 --> 38:19.000
I realize they don't blame me in the same way I don't blame them

38:19.000 --> 38:21.000
I'm a little sick of hearing about

38:21.000 --> 38:23.000
All these folks in the media and so forth

38:23.000 --> 38:24.000
I feel for their families

38:24.000 --> 38:26.000
I feel for what they're going through

38:26.000 --> 38:28.000
But I understand

38:28.000 --> 38:31.000
I'm coming to terms with why the media shoves this down our throat

38:31.000 --> 38:35.000
For the same reason why Beth was splashed over every local news station

38:35.000 --> 38:37.000
Here in Sacramento

38:37.000 --> 38:38.000
Is that

38:38.000 --> 38:42.000
I don't want to get too deep here on a video game talk show

38:42.000 --> 38:44.000
I'm sorry but this has been a lot that's been on my mind this week

38:44.000 --> 38:46.000
Seven years we do what we want right

38:46.000 --> 38:50.000
Death is something that we don't understand

38:50.000 --> 38:54.000
We have a lot of reasons and things that we try to come up with

38:54.000 --> 38:55.000
To explain it

38:55.000 --> 38:57.000
That's religion right

38:57.000 --> 39:00.000
But at the end of the day we don't really understand death

39:00.000 --> 39:03.000
So when it happens

39:03.000 --> 39:05.000
We do what we can

39:05.000 --> 39:09.000
To try and I guess understand it

39:09.000 --> 39:11.000
I don't know is there something you want to point out

39:11.000 --> 39:13.000
I actually wrote a blog post about it after

39:13.000 --> 39:17.000
Because the day that you posted about Beth

39:17.000 --> 39:19.000
One of my good friends at work

39:19.000 --> 39:20.000
We found out he died

39:20.000 --> 39:21.000
That's right

39:21.000 --> 39:23.000
And I found out that he had been a little sick

39:23.000 --> 39:26.000
But was just going to go see the doctor because he was experiencing heartburn

39:26.000 --> 39:30.000
But of course heartburn also was one of the first signs of a heart attack

39:30.000 --> 39:33.000
And he didn't come in on Monday

39:33.000 --> 39:35.000
And I actually was looking for him on Monday

39:35.000 --> 39:36.000
We had been talking about Linux

39:36.000 --> 39:38.000
And I was going to show him my laptop

39:38.000 --> 39:42.000
And we didn't see him we didn't hear from him

39:42.000 --> 39:44.000
He's always super good about calling in

39:44.000 --> 39:45.000
He's like the man there

39:45.000 --> 39:48.000
He knows so much about everything you know

39:48.000 --> 39:50.000
And just completely fun to be around

39:50.000 --> 39:54.000
And then Tuesday one of the people in his department

39:54.000 --> 39:56.000
Called his sister

39:56.000 --> 39:58.000
And so she sent her husband to go check on

39:58.000 --> 40:00.000
His name is Pete

40:00.000 --> 40:03.000
And went to go check on over at Pete's apartment

40:03.000 --> 40:05.000
And found him dead

40:05.000 --> 40:07.000
So

40:07.000 --> 40:09.000
And I freaked out

40:09.000 --> 40:12.000
And then of course that same afternoon is when I went in to have my consultation

40:12.000 --> 40:13.000
So

40:13.000 --> 40:15.000
But it's like I came home

40:15.000 --> 40:19.000
It was I think I actually wrote up my post on my blog

40:19.000 --> 40:21.000
And I'll link it in the chat if anyone wants to see it

40:21.000 --> 40:23.000
Just about getting it all out

40:23.000 --> 40:24.000
Because it's like you were saying

40:24.000 --> 40:26.000
And my own belief is that

40:26.000 --> 40:28.000
And this is again this to me I'm sorry for getting philosophical

40:28.000 --> 40:30.000
It just happens

40:30.000 --> 40:31.000
I don't think anyone singled out

40:31.000 --> 40:34.000
I don't think that there's any sort of cosmic vendetta

40:34.000 --> 40:36.000
I don't really believe in karma

40:36.000 --> 40:38.000
I want to make this very clear

40:38.000 --> 40:40.000
Because a lot of people even locally

40:40.000 --> 40:42.000
And reading comments on news stations and stuff misunderstand this

40:42.000 --> 40:44.000
I want to make some things clear

40:44.000 --> 40:46.000
Beth did not go to Mexico

40:46.000 --> 40:48.000
Beth went to Las Vegas but Beth did not go to Mexico

40:48.000 --> 40:50.000
Beth

40:50.000 --> 40:52.000
None of Beth's friends have this disease

40:52.000 --> 40:55.000
Those that live with her those that know her have been tested for it

40:55.000 --> 40:58.000
This is an isolated incident

40:58.000 --> 41:00.000
She was healthy

41:00.000 --> 41:02.000
Yes she was a little overweight

41:02.000 --> 41:04.000
But you know what so were most of Americans

41:04.000 --> 41:06.000
Welcome to the USA

41:06.000 --> 41:10.000
She was a healthy, fun loving, happy individual

41:10.000 --> 41:13.000
This has not been explained

41:13.000 --> 41:15.000
This may not be explained

41:15.000 --> 41:17.000
That's the weird thing about it

41:17.000 --> 41:19.000
It happened

41:19.000 --> 41:21.000
Here's honestly this way

41:21.000 --> 41:23.000
That's really in my belief system

41:23.000 --> 41:25.000
Disasters

41:25.000 --> 41:27.000
Whether they be something like this

41:27.000 --> 41:29.000
Whether they be a hurricane

41:29.000 --> 41:31.000
Whether they be a flood

41:31.000 --> 41:33.000
I don't think that it's any

41:33.000 --> 41:35.000
Like God's punishing people

41:35.000 --> 41:37.000
I don't believe that God punishes people

41:37.000 --> 41:39.000
I think God's got way too many other things to do

41:39.000 --> 41:41.000
To deal with our petty little problems

41:41.000 --> 41:43.000
Honestly

41:43.000 --> 41:45.000
And so I don't believe

41:45.000 --> 41:47.000
That there's a great cosmic hand

41:47.000 --> 41:49.000
In the disasters or the good things that happen in life

41:49.000 --> 41:51.000
I think they just happen

41:51.000 --> 41:53.000
They're not in motion to happen

41:53.000 --> 41:55.000
They're not predestined

41:55.000 --> 41:57.000
This is how it happens

41:57.000 --> 41:59.000
She may not have had

41:59.000 --> 42:01.000
A good immune system

42:01.000 --> 42:03.000
As far as that goes

42:03.000 --> 42:05.000
Some people

42:05.000 --> 42:07.000
I've known people who have been

42:07.000 --> 42:09.000
Almost hospitalized

42:09.000 --> 42:11.000
From just plain old illnesses

42:11.000 --> 42:13.000
I had pneumonia for three months

42:13.000 --> 42:15.000
And it almost went in the hospital

42:15.000 --> 42:17.000
I just really think it just happens

42:17.000 --> 42:19.000
And the best way to deal with it

42:19.000 --> 42:21.000
Is just accept that it happens

42:21.000 --> 42:23.000
And remember the good parts

42:23.000 --> 42:25.000
I want to thank the chat room for being so supportive

42:25.000 --> 42:27.000
On our big tangent tonight

42:27.000 --> 42:29.000
Blue 22 in chat

42:29.000 --> 42:31.000
Death is the one topic that brings people together

42:31.000 --> 42:33.000
That's very true

42:33.000 --> 42:35.000
And some other folks sharing their own very personal stories

42:35.000 --> 42:37.000
About this whole thing

42:37.000 --> 42:39.000
And what's funny

42:39.000 --> 42:41.000
The way Dark Sakura explains it

42:41.000 --> 42:43.000
I don't want to belittle what she's saying

42:43.000 --> 42:45.000
Because I think she's right

42:45.000 --> 42:47.000
Is very similar to the way Sesame Street explains it

42:47.000 --> 42:49.000
Of the generation you and I come from

42:49.000 --> 42:51.000
Do you remember when Mr. Hooper died?

42:51.000 --> 42:53.000
I do

42:53.000 --> 42:55.000
That was a huge

42:55.000 --> 42:57.000
Thing in television at the time

42:57.000 --> 42:59.000
Because that actor who had played Mr. Hooper died

42:59.000 --> 43:01.000
And they had to explain that to the children

43:01.000 --> 43:03.000
Because I don't know how they do Sesame Street now

43:03.000 --> 43:05.000
But back then they kind of taped it

43:05.000 --> 43:07.000
Not live but

43:07.000 --> 43:09.000
It was only a couple weeks behind

43:09.000 --> 43:11.000
A little off the cuff too

43:11.000 --> 43:13.000
So they had to explain it

43:13.000 --> 43:15.000
And the way they explained it

43:15.000 --> 43:17.000
The actor was so upset about it

43:17.000 --> 43:19.000
Go watch this on YouTube

43:19.000 --> 43:21.000
You want to see one of the greatest television

43:21.000 --> 43:23.000
I am not fucking with you

43:23.000 --> 43:25.000
This is one of the greatest television moments ever

43:25.000 --> 43:27.000
Go look up

43:27.000 --> 43:29.000
I watch this live

43:29.000 --> 43:31.000
Go watch Big Bird and Mr. Hooper's death

43:31.000 --> 43:33.000
YouTube Mr. Hooper death

43:33.000 --> 43:35.000
You'll find it somewhere

43:35.000 --> 43:37.000
And watch how they explain it

43:37.000 --> 43:39.000
Because the way they explain it to Big Bird

43:39.000 --> 43:41.000
Is that he's wailing

43:41.000 --> 43:43.000
He's bawling

43:43.000 --> 43:45.000
And finally the only answer that he'll accept

43:45.000 --> 43:47.000
This is just something that happens

43:47.000 --> 43:49.000
Yeah

43:49.000 --> 43:51.000
Anyway

43:51.000 --> 43:53.000
I don't mean to get too off the subject

43:53.000 --> 43:55.000
But with the whole

43:55.000 --> 43:57.000
Tributes to Michael Jackson and all this stuff

43:57.000 --> 43:59.000
And all this stuff in the media and so forth

43:59.000 --> 44:01.000
I don't really want to join in

44:01.000 --> 44:03.000
But at the same time I understand

44:03.000 --> 44:05.000
Don't get me wrong

44:05.000 --> 44:07.000
The man made great contributions to popular culture

44:07.000 --> 44:09.000
Say what you will about his personal life

44:09.000 --> 44:11.000
His personal life

44:11.000 --> 44:13.000
Unless he broke, well whatever

44:13.000 --> 44:15.000
He is who he is

44:15.000 --> 44:17.000
Let's leave it at that

44:17.000 --> 44:19.000
But I think

44:19.000 --> 44:21.000
The reason why everybody's talking about it

44:21.000 --> 44:23.000
And the reason why it's in the media and all this other stuff

44:23.000 --> 44:25.000
Is that

44:25.000 --> 44:27.000
This topic kind of brings

44:27.000 --> 44:29.000
People closer together

44:29.000 --> 44:31.000
It kind of helps people try and understand

44:31.000 --> 44:33.000
What cannot be explained

44:33.000 --> 44:35.000
I mean

44:35.000 --> 44:37.000
Who hasn't heard a Michael Jackson song?

44:37.000 --> 44:39.000
Everybody has heard a fucking

44:39.000 --> 44:41.000
Michael Jackson song at some point in their life

44:41.000 --> 44:43.000
Unless they're deaf

44:43.000 --> 44:45.000
You know what I mean

44:45.000 --> 44:47.000
Even then you've probably seen him dance

44:47.000 --> 44:49.000
Okay

44:49.000 --> 44:51.000
You have somehow been influenced

44:51.000 --> 44:53.000
By this guy one way or the other

44:53.000 --> 44:55.000
So when somebody like that passes away

44:55.000 --> 44:57.000
There's definitely

44:57.000 --> 44:59.000
Everybody's going to feel that type of connection

44:59.000 --> 45:01.000
Like oh I remember that song

45:01.000 --> 45:03.000
Or oh I remember watching it on TV

45:03.000 --> 45:05.000
And like I'm not going to get to see that again

45:05.000 --> 45:07.000
Although that's not really the case

45:07.000 --> 45:09.000
Because the nice thing about being an artist

45:09.000 --> 45:11.000
Is the contributions you make live on

45:11.000 --> 45:13.000
Forever

45:13.000 --> 45:15.000
It feels like something that

45:15.000 --> 45:17.000
And I'm not going to say

45:17.000 --> 45:19.000
Because honestly once I got older

45:19.000 --> 45:21.000
I didn't really care for his stuff too much anymore

45:21.000 --> 45:23.000
But I had a Michael Jackson doll when I was little

45:23.000 --> 45:25.000
You know I grew up that way

45:25.000 --> 45:27.000
I had the Billie Jean poster on my wall

45:27.000 --> 45:29.000
You know when I was little

45:29.000 --> 45:31.000
It's when you have

45:31.000 --> 45:33.000
An icon like that

45:33.000 --> 45:35.000
That is a part of

45:35.000 --> 45:37.000
What formed who you are

45:37.000 --> 45:39.000
Even if it's a little part something that's been an influence in your life

45:39.000 --> 45:41.000
When it's gone it's like

45:41.000 --> 45:43.000
Oh

45:43.000 --> 45:45.000
Oh you know it's that sort of

45:45.000 --> 45:47.000
Huh feeling

45:47.000 --> 45:49.000
Okay but with the infomercial guy that died today

45:49.000 --> 45:51.000
I'm not understanding that one

45:51.000 --> 45:55.000
Do people really truly miss him

45:55.000 --> 45:57.000
That aren't his friends and family

45:57.000 --> 45:59.000
Which I'm very sorry to hear about their loss

45:59.000 --> 46:01.000
It sounds like it was a sudden thing

46:01.000 --> 46:03.000
But it's a trending topic on Twitter

46:03.000 --> 46:05.000
Like really

46:05.000 --> 46:07.000
Was he really that influential

46:07.000 --> 46:09.000
Like maybe I'm missing something

46:09.000 --> 46:11.000
And I'm sorry I don't mean to offend

46:11.000 --> 46:13.000
Keep in mind he spawned

46:13.000 --> 46:15.000
A lot of funny

46:15.000 --> 46:17.000
He was one of those things

46:17.000 --> 46:19.000
Just like a 4chan funeral or something

46:19.000 --> 46:21.000
I would expect

46:21.000 --> 46:23.000
So I think it's just more like

46:23.000 --> 46:25.000
Oh that guy

46:25.000 --> 46:27.000
You know because you don't have

46:27.000 --> 46:29.000
Him to kick around anymore

46:29.000 --> 46:31.000
You know

46:31.000 --> 46:33.000
Especially though for all the celebrity deaths

46:33.000 --> 46:35.000
I was the saddest about Farrah Fawcett

46:35.000 --> 46:37.000
Not because of her fantastic hair

46:37.000 --> 46:39.000
And I think it's horrible though

46:39.000 --> 46:41.000
To die of anal cancer

46:41.000 --> 46:43.000
That's just

46:43.000 --> 46:45.000
A horrible thing

46:45.000 --> 46:47.000
If I try to watch her NBC special

46:47.000 --> 46:49.000
I can't watch it

46:49.000 --> 46:51.000
I get so choked up I feel like I'm gonna barf

46:51.000 --> 46:53.000
But you know what I think the worst thing was

46:53.000 --> 46:55.000
Is that she was gonna marry what's-his-name

46:55.000 --> 46:57.000
We are taking this video game talk show

46:57.000 --> 46:59.000
And really just getting way too deep tonight

46:59.000 --> 47:01.000
Which is supposed to be celebratory

47:01.000 --> 47:03.000
It's our fucking show

47:03.000 --> 47:05.000
Guess what

47:05.000 --> 47:07.000
There's no Santa Claus either

47:07.000 --> 47:09.000
And the Easter Bunny was made up by

47:09.000 --> 47:11.000
Pagans

47:13.000 --> 47:15.000
Bobby Blackwolf our old buddy here

47:15.000 --> 47:17.000
One thing to realize is that he was also on a reality show

47:17.000 --> 47:19.000
On Discovery about pitchmen

47:19.000 --> 47:21.000
And a lot of people watched that

47:21.000 --> 47:23.000
Because it showed more about the way he was outside

47:23.000 --> 47:25.000
Of screaming here's how to order

47:25.000 --> 47:27.000
So that's why I think more people got hit

47:27.000 --> 47:29.000
By Billy Mays than you would expect

47:29.000 --> 47:31.000
I watch pitchmen and all he does is scream

47:31.000 --> 47:33.000
On the show

47:33.000 --> 47:35.000
No really he doesn't

47:35.000 --> 47:37.000
It's weird

47:37.000 --> 47:39.000
No offense to Beth or anything

47:39.000 --> 47:41.000
But out of all the celebrity deaths

47:41.000 --> 47:43.000
Actually the Billy Mays one was the most surprising

47:43.000 --> 47:45.000
It's like holy crap

47:45.000 --> 47:47.000
What the hell

47:47.000 --> 47:49.000
There's somebody that's in perfectly good health

47:49.000 --> 47:51.000
But apparently

47:51.000 --> 47:53.000
The circumstances were all around

47:53.000 --> 47:55.000
Apparently he was on a plane

47:55.000 --> 47:57.000
That landed really

47:57.000 --> 47:59.000
I don't know

47:59.000 --> 48:01.000
Had a bad landing I guess

48:01.000 --> 48:03.000
And it caused part of the ceiling or whatever

48:03.000 --> 48:05.000
To hit him in the head and maybe

48:05.000 --> 48:07.000
Did some brain damage that way and he died in his sleep

48:07.000 --> 48:09.000
What

48:09.000 --> 48:11.000
It was an American Airlines flight

48:11.000 --> 48:13.000
So that's what's

48:13.000 --> 48:15.000
Going on there

48:15.000 --> 48:17.000
He died a few days later I guess

48:17.000 --> 48:19.000
That so doesn't sound

48:19.000 --> 48:21.000
Real

48:21.000 --> 48:23.000
We would be hearing so much more about

48:23.000 --> 48:25.000
This impending lawsuit and all this stuff

48:25.000 --> 48:27.000
I think there will be an impending lawsuit

48:27.000 --> 48:29.000
It sounds like it but

48:29.000 --> 48:31.000
The pitchmen show is kind of fun

48:31.000 --> 48:33.000
I like watching it

48:33.000 --> 48:35.000
I don't mean any disrespect

48:35.000 --> 48:37.000
It's just been such a weird week

48:37.000 --> 48:39.000
We've been celebrating death

48:39.000 --> 48:41.000
I shouldn't say celebrating

48:41.000 --> 48:43.000
But you know what I mean memorializing

48:43.000 --> 48:45.000
Trying to understand

48:45.000 --> 48:47.000
Who will be tomorrow? Which celebrity is going to die tomorrow?

48:47.000 --> 48:49.000
Life in the same week

48:49.000 --> 48:51.000
My birthday was this week

48:51.000 --> 48:53.000
I have because Beth only got 24

48:53.000 --> 48:55.000
And you know

48:55.000 --> 48:57.000
It just kind of goes to show

48:57.000 --> 48:59.000
And I know this sounds like such a hokey

48:59.000 --> 49:01.000
Dumb thing to say

49:01.000 --> 49:03.000
But it really is so true

49:03.000 --> 49:05.000
You've got to make the most out of the borrowed time you got

49:05.000 --> 49:07.000
You do if there's something

49:07.000 --> 49:09.000
That you've been wanting to do for a long time

49:09.000 --> 49:11.000
That you haven't done yet

49:11.000 --> 49:13.000
You need to just do it

49:13.000 --> 49:15.000
Stop making excuses and do it

49:15.000 --> 49:17.000
Because you may not be here tomorrow to do it then

49:17.000 --> 49:19.000
So seriously

49:19.000 --> 49:21.000
And I'm going to have to use instances like these

49:21.000 --> 49:23.000
To remind me to get off my butt

49:23.000 --> 49:25.000
And motivate myself

49:25.000 --> 49:27.000
Because I should be thankful I'm here to do them

49:27.000 --> 49:29.000
The other thing I want to say

49:29.000 --> 49:31.000
Is that obviously swine flu ain't a joke

49:31.000 --> 49:33.000
And I'm not saying you should run around

49:33.000 --> 49:35.000
Be crazy scared of it

49:35.000 --> 49:37.000
Wearing flu masks in public and all this stuff

49:37.000 --> 49:39.000
But what I am saying

49:39.000 --> 49:41.000
Boys, when you use the potty

49:41.000 --> 49:43.000
Wash your hands after you go

49:43.000 --> 49:45.000
Because I've watched people go in the men's room

49:45.000 --> 49:47.000
And then just go right out

49:47.000 --> 49:49.000
Perverts, I'm being serious for a minute here

49:49.000 --> 49:51.000
You know you've seen this too

49:51.000 --> 49:53.000
Maybe you've been a culprit

49:53.000 --> 49:55.000
Walk in the men's room, use the restroom

49:55.000 --> 49:57.000
Then walk right out without washing your hands

49:57.000 --> 49:59.000
That shit needs to stop

49:59.000 --> 50:01.000
We need to have a little more sanitary

50:01.000 --> 50:03.000
We might not be able to stop disease

50:03.000 --> 50:05.000
Completely

50:05.000 --> 50:07.000
We can sure slow it down

50:07.000 --> 50:09.000
And if anything this just goes to further

50:09.000 --> 50:11.000
Emphasize the point that Vegas is dirty

50:13.000 --> 50:15.000
Very dirty

50:15.000 --> 50:17.000
Well, I don't know

50:17.000 --> 50:19.000
We're not gonna know

50:19.000 --> 50:21.000
But here's the thing

50:21.000 --> 50:23.000
Wash your hands

50:23.000 --> 50:25.000
After the bathroom, in general

50:25.000 --> 50:27.000
After eating and all that stuff

50:27.000 --> 50:29.000
Keep hand sanitizer with you

50:29.000 --> 50:31.000
You don't have to be crazy germ obsessive

50:31.000 --> 50:33.000
I don't think we need to start a frenzy

50:33.000 --> 50:35.000
And I think that's sometimes what the media does

50:35.000 --> 50:37.000
But just be careful

50:37.000 --> 50:39.000
That's it

50:39.000 --> 50:41.000
Be careful and don't be lazy

50:41.000 --> 50:43.000
So there you go

50:43.000 --> 50:45.000
Anyhow

50:45.000 --> 50:47.000
That's, I guess, that for the deep topics

50:47.000 --> 50:49.000
Let's get back into video games for a minute, can we?

50:49.000 --> 50:51.000
I know, Loki, you've been awfully quiet

50:51.000 --> 50:53.000
This whole time. Surely you've got some game stories

50:53.000 --> 50:55.000
To take us away

50:55.000 --> 50:57.000
I just want to say, though, again, we don't have a script tonight

50:57.000 --> 50:59.000
So we're just gonna kind of wing it tonight with the game stories

50:59.000 --> 51:01.000
We'll talk about things

51:01.000 --> 51:03.000
We'll open up the Skype line a little bit if you guys want to call in as well

51:03.000 --> 51:05.000
Also, housekeeping

51:05.000 --> 51:07.000
If you want to add us on Facebook, that would be wonderful

51:07.000 --> 51:09.000

And you're listening to us live on this Sunday night

51:27.000 --> 51:29.000
On All Games Radio, please join us

51:29.000 --> 51:31.000
Chat.All... Chat.

51:31.000 --> 51:33.000
Oops, I almost gave the wrong chat room

51:33.000 --> 51:35.000
Chat.OrangeLoungeRadio.com

51:35.000 --> 51:37.000
There you go

51:37.000 --> 51:39.000
Actually, I was reading an article on The Consumerists

51:39.000 --> 51:41.000
By having an issue with his bacon of the month club

51:41.000 --> 51:43.000
I was just surprised that there was a bacon of the month club

51:43.000 --> 51:45.000
Of course it makes sense

51:45.000 --> 51:47.000
Because bacon is awesome

51:47.000 --> 51:49.000
And why not celebrate it once a month for 12 months

51:49.000 --> 51:51.000
But uh

51:51.000 --> 51:53.000
Yeah, it's interesting

51:53.000 --> 51:55.000
Apparently not a very good program though

51:55.000 --> 51:57.000
Better to buy your own bacon

51:57.000 --> 51:59.000
But anyways

51:59.000 --> 52:01.000
So yeah, stuff that's happened this week

52:01.000 --> 52:03.000
A whole lot of interesting things

52:03.000 --> 52:05.000
I guess I'll start things off with talking about

52:05.000 --> 52:07.000
Best Buy

52:07.000 --> 52:11.000
They're getting into the kiosk business I guess

52:11.000 --> 52:13.000
And they're actually installing

52:13.000 --> 52:15.000
They're testing it right now

52:15.000 --> 52:17.000
They're installing some kiosks into a few of their stores

52:17.000 --> 52:19.000
That are gonna do

52:19.000 --> 52:21.000
Use game trade-ins

52:21.000 --> 52:23.000
And also use movie trade-ins

52:23.000 --> 52:25.000
So you can actually trade in your games

52:25.000 --> 52:27.000
At these kiosks

52:27.000 --> 52:29.000
And then

52:29.000 --> 52:31.000
You basically get credit for whatever's in there

52:31.000 --> 52:33.000
And they give you the credit

52:33.000 --> 52:35.000
On a Best Buy card

52:35.000 --> 52:37.000
And you get to go spend that credit in the store

52:37.000 --> 52:39.000
Which I think is kind of a neat idea

52:39.000 --> 52:41.000
And hey, you know, I'm all about

52:41.000 --> 52:43.000
You know, getting

52:43.000 --> 52:45.000
Um

52:45.000 --> 52:47.000
You know, alternatives to like GameStop

52:47.000 --> 52:49.000
And you know the thing that's kind of pissed me off about GameStop lately

52:49.000 --> 52:51.000
Is when you do trades

52:51.000 --> 52:53.000
Before they used to go, okay

52:53.000 --> 52:55.000
You know, they scan a game, okay that was $18

52:55.000 --> 52:57.000
Okay, here's, this is $24

52:57.000 --> 52:59.000
And stuff like that

52:59.000 --> 53:01.000
Now it's just like, they have all your trades

53:01.000 --> 53:03.000
They've already put them behind the counter

53:03.000 --> 53:05.000
And they give you pretty much store credit

53:05.000 --> 53:07.000
It's like, well, you know, what if that was not satisfactory to me?

53:07.000 --> 53:09.000
What if, you know, they don't say

53:09.000 --> 53:11.000
Oh yeah, by the way, that one game was only worth 50 cents

53:11.000 --> 53:13.000
You know, that

53:13.000 --> 53:15.000
I don't like how they do that, it's kind of shady

53:15.000 --> 53:17.000
You know, every place else tells you what you're getting for each game

53:17.000 --> 53:19.000
That you trade in or movie or whatever

53:19.000 --> 53:21.000
Is that just maybe the particular GameStop you're going to?

53:21.000 --> 53:23.000
No, it's, they've all been doing it now

53:23.000 --> 53:25.000
So, I don't know, maybe it's just

53:25.000 --> 53:27.000
They don't care or whatever

53:27.000 --> 53:29.000
But they used to do that, so

53:29.000 --> 53:31.000
Now, what's kind of cool about this is

53:31.000 --> 53:33.000
Basically, it works like this

53:33.000 --> 53:35.000
You go to the kiosk

53:35.000 --> 53:37.000
You scan the barcodes of the games that you have

53:37.000 --> 53:39.000
On the machine

53:39.000 --> 53:41.000
And it will tell you how much

53:41.000 --> 53:43.000
It's going to give you for those games

53:43.000 --> 53:45.000
And you say, okay

53:45.000 --> 53:47.000
Whether to accept or deny that offer

53:47.000 --> 53:49.000
So if you accept it

53:49.000 --> 53:51.000
Then what you'll do is you'll pop the disc out

53:51.000 --> 53:53.000
You'll drop the case into almost like a drop box

53:53.000 --> 53:55.000
That they have there, like a mailbox

53:55.000 --> 53:57.000
And then the discs themselves

53:57.000 --> 53:59.000
Insert it into the machine

53:59.000 --> 54:01.000
And it will scan them to make sure

54:01.000 --> 54:03.000
That they're readable or don't have scratches on them

54:03.000 --> 54:05.000
Or verify

54:05.000 --> 54:07.000
I guess

54:07.000 --> 54:09.000
If it's an authentic game or whatever

54:09.000 --> 54:11.000
I don't know, the whole process

54:11.000 --> 54:13.000
To me doesn't seem like it would work

54:13.000 --> 54:15.000
Because

54:15.000 --> 54:17.000
You know, the read

54:17.000 --> 54:19.000
An Xbox 360 disc versus

54:19.000 --> 54:21.000
Reading a Wii disc is completely different

54:21.000 --> 54:23.000
And I mean, if you ever tried reading

54:23.000 --> 54:25.000
A Wii disc on your PC

54:25.000 --> 54:27.000
It doesn't work, it's because they read them differently

54:27.000 --> 54:29.000
They have a different file format

54:29.000 --> 54:31.000
So if it's actually physically scanning

54:31.000 --> 54:33.000
The surface of the disc, make sure there's no

54:33.000 --> 54:35.000
Scratches, I guess

54:35.000 --> 54:37.000
Maybe that's how it's working

54:37.000 --> 54:39.000
There's another one I think that they scanned

54:39.000 --> 54:41.000
Like a little barcode that's in the middle of the disc

54:41.000 --> 54:43.000
I'm not sure if that's how it's working

54:43.000 --> 54:45.000
But either way, to kind of get around the whole

54:45.000 --> 54:47.000
People just burning copies

54:47.000 --> 54:49.000
Or whatever, just faking

54:49.000 --> 54:51.000
Out the machine

54:51.000 --> 54:53.000
You actually do have to scan a credit card in there as well

54:53.000 --> 54:55.000
For verification purposes

54:55.000 --> 54:57.000
At the same time, it makes me wonder

54:57.000 --> 54:59.000
Huh, you know, I get these

54:59.000 --> 55:01.000
Pre-paid cards or whatever from

55:01.000 --> 55:03.000
My work every now and then for incentives

55:03.000 --> 55:05.000
And spiffs, and you can basically put

55:05.000 --> 55:07.000
Whatever information you want on those

55:07.000 --> 55:09.000
Like you literally go onto a website

55:09.000 --> 55:11.000
Log in, and you type in whatever

55:11.000 --> 55:13.000
Billing information, if I wanted to make myself look like

55:13.000 --> 55:15.000
Bob Barker or something like that, I could do that

55:15.000 --> 55:17.000
And there's really no way

55:17.000 --> 55:19.000
For the system to know, so

55:19.000 --> 55:21.000
Here's what I don't understand

55:21.000 --> 55:23.000
Why this whole elaborate

55:23.000 --> 55:25.000
Kiosk thing

55:25.000 --> 55:27.000
If this is the business Best Buy wants to get into

55:27.000 --> 55:29.000
I mean, it's not like the stores are always

55:29.000 --> 55:31.000
That freaking crowded and full of people

55:31.000 --> 55:33.000
They're trying to- Why can't the service associates

55:33.000 --> 55:35.000
Just scan the games and check them out

55:35.000 --> 55:37.000
The old fashioned way? I don't know

55:37.000 --> 55:39.000
Well, maybe it's because they're trying to get into more

55:39.000 --> 55:41.000
Of like a GameStop

55:41.000 --> 55:43.000
Type of business model

55:43.000 --> 55:45.000
But at the same time, they don't want to really

55:45.000 --> 55:47.000
I don't know

55:47.000 --> 55:49.000
Train people to do it? Yes

55:49.000 --> 55:51.000
Train people to do it, and also they're planning on

55:51.000 --> 55:53.000
Doing this later on for- Don't they have to train people

55:53.000 --> 55:55.000
To fix the machines? There's gonna have to be

55:55.000 --> 55:57.000
Somebody in the store that knows how to operate

55:57.000 --> 55:59.000
These machines all the time Not necessarily

55:59.000 --> 56:01.000
Just like, you know, the red box machines

56:01.000 --> 56:03.000
And stuff like that, they're in Walmarts and stuff

56:03.000 --> 56:05.000
They have an independent company that comes out there

56:05.000 --> 56:07.000
And services those machines

56:07.000 --> 56:09.000
And the same thing for these

56:09.000 --> 56:11.000
I have a feeling these are just branded

56:11.000 --> 56:13.000
E-Play machines

56:13.000 --> 56:15.000
Because E-Play is also

56:15.000 --> 56:17.000
Working with, I want to say

56:17.000 --> 56:19.000
Walmart as well

56:19.000 --> 56:21.000
They're gonna be doing the same type of thing

56:21.000 --> 56:23.000
Game trading it, and I bet you anything

56:23.000 --> 56:25.000
They can brand their machines so it'll look like

56:25.000 --> 56:27.000
Any sort of stuff

56:27.000 --> 56:29.000
Walmart's machines are just gonna say Walmart

56:29.000 --> 56:31.000
It's not gonna say E-Play

56:31.000 --> 56:33.000
But I bet you these are the same machines

56:33.000 --> 56:35.000
Because it sounds like the exact same thing that they're doing

56:35.000 --> 56:37.000
With Walmart

56:37.000 --> 56:39.000
I have so many games I should be trading back

56:39.000 --> 56:41.000
I haven't even sold back a game in like years

56:41.000 --> 56:43.000
No, probably been about a year

56:43.000 --> 56:45.000
Probably about a year and a half

56:45.000 --> 56:47.000
Was the last time I sold back a game

56:47.000 --> 56:49.000
What was the last one on the GameCube?

56:49.000 --> 56:51.000
I went and sold that one back finally

56:51.000 --> 56:53.000
Seven was the GameCube one, right?

56:53.000 --> 56:55.000
It was a couple Wii games

56:55.000 --> 56:57.000
Oh no, Full Auto on the 360

56:57.000 --> 56:59.000
I sold that back and the tennis game Top Spin I had

56:59.000 --> 57:01.000
You know, games I just wasn't playing at all

57:01.000 --> 57:03.000
But you know, you don't get that much for them

57:03.000 --> 57:05.000
I think the game I got more for than any other

57:05.000 --> 57:07.000
Was Mario Party

57:07.000 --> 57:09.000
But that's because they'd stopped making it

57:09.000 --> 57:11.000
And it was still in demand

57:11.000 --> 57:13.000
There's a few games that'll be coming in high demand

57:13.000 --> 57:15.000
And stuff like that

57:15.000 --> 57:17.000
But for stuff that I don't plan on playing

57:17.000 --> 57:19.000
Or I may have already picked up

57:19.000 --> 57:21.000
Or whatnot

57:21.000 --> 57:23.000
I try to trade it in as soon as I get it

57:23.000 --> 57:25.000
Because that's usually what it's worth the most

57:25.000 --> 57:27.000
And yeah, I know I can make a lot more money

57:27.000 --> 57:29.000
Selling it on eBay

57:29.000 --> 57:31.000
But to be honest, I just don't want to go through the hassle

57:31.000 --> 57:33.000
And for me, it doesn't really make a difference

57:33.000 --> 57:35.000
Because I'm not really losing out any money

57:35.000 --> 57:37.000
When you think about it

57:37.000 --> 57:39.000
Because I'm paying nothing to get the game

57:39.000 --> 57:41.000
And any money I make from it

57:41.000 --> 57:43.000
Is more money than I would have had anyways

57:43.000 --> 57:45.000
So, I don't know

57:45.000 --> 57:47.000
And a lot of times, you know, store credit and stuff

57:47.000 --> 57:49.000
Sits on my card forever

57:49.000 --> 57:51.000
You know, for a very long time before I actually use it for stuff

57:51.000 --> 57:53.000
Because honestly

57:53.000 --> 57:55.000
You know, with the situation that I have

57:55.000 --> 57:57.000
My Wii is modded, my Xbox 360 is modded

57:57.000 --> 57:59.000
The PS3 is the only thing that's not really modded

57:59.000 --> 58:01.000
My PSP is modded, my DS is modded

58:01.000 --> 58:03.000
I don't really have to buy games if I don't want to

58:03.000 --> 58:05.000
I mean, that's the thing

58:05.000 --> 58:07.000
I don't have to buy games

58:07.000 --> 58:09.000
Because I can get them through other means

58:09.000 --> 58:11.000
If I really want to play them

58:11.000 --> 58:13.000
But honestly, I have less time to play games now

58:13.000 --> 58:17.000
And, you know, I'm really not going to have time soon enough

58:17.000 --> 58:19.000
Yes, exactly

58:19.000 --> 58:21.000
So, you know, there's really

58:21.000 --> 58:23.000
I don't, you know, maybe that's not

58:23.000 --> 58:25.000
A great way to look at it

58:25.000 --> 58:27.000
Because I'm sure a lot of developers and stuff work hard

58:27.000 --> 58:29.000
And, you know, I'm putting out the games

58:29.000 --> 58:31.000
But you know what, it's one game

58:31.000 --> 58:33.000
And I mean, really

58:33.000 --> 58:35.000
I don't know

58:35.000 --> 58:37.000
I just don't care

58:37.000 --> 58:39.000
And I know that's probably a bad, you know, stance on that

58:39.000 --> 58:41.000
But I don't care

58:41.000 --> 58:43.000
I do find it interesting

58:43.000 --> 58:45.000
Everybody is trying to get into this business

58:45.000 --> 58:47.000
It's going to be interesting to see if GameStop

58:47.000 --> 58:49.000
Has to do something to

58:49.000 --> 58:51.000
And other game stores, you know, have to do something

58:51.000 --> 58:53.000
To kind of reinvigorate their business

58:53.000 --> 58:55.000
With all this competition

58:55.000 --> 58:57.000
Well, I could see them maybe putting an actual kiosk

58:57.000 --> 58:59.000
Out in front of their store or something like that

58:59.000 --> 59:01.000
You know, hey, look

59:01.000 --> 59:03.000
Now you can trade games, you know

59:03.000 --> 59:05.000
While we're closed

59:05.000 --> 59:07.000
Or, you know, the other thing that these machines

59:07.000 --> 59:09.000
Can do is allow you to rent

59:09.000 --> 59:11.000
Games as well

59:11.000 --> 59:13.000
Which, you know, they're testing that

59:13.000 --> 59:15.000
And I think that's a great idea

59:15.000 --> 59:17.000
You know, because, A, renting games

59:17.000 --> 59:19.000
You know, especially when you can stick these kiosks

59:19.000 --> 59:21.000
You know, like say in an apartment complex

59:21.000 --> 59:23.000
Or something like that

59:23.000 --> 59:25.000
That's kind of cool

59:25.000 --> 59:27.000
And you can also trade movies into this

59:27.000 --> 59:29.000
Which is also pretty cool because, you know what

59:29.000 --> 59:31.000
GameStop doesn't take movies back anymore

59:31.000 --> 59:33.000
They've stopped selling movies because it didn't work for them

59:33.000 --> 59:35.000
So that's something else

59:35.000 --> 59:37.000
So if you want to trade in

59:37.000 --> 59:39.000
Now you don't have to necessarily buy a game with it

59:39.000 --> 59:41.000
You can buy, you know, blank CD artists

59:41.000 --> 59:43.000
Or, you know, an iPod

59:43.000 --> 59:45.000
Or, you know, TV

59:45.000 --> 59:47.000
That's one thing I do like about it

59:47.000 --> 59:49.000
Is that, you know what, I could see myself using this money

59:49.000 --> 59:51.000
More effectively at Best Buy

59:51.000 --> 59:53.000
Just because there's more to pick from

59:53.000 --> 59:55.000
Or, and the other thing too

59:55.000 --> 59:57.000
You need a gift card for Best Buy

59:57.000 --> 59:59.000
And then you go up front where they have their gift card kiosks

59:59.000 --> 01:00:01.000
You know, with all these different gift cards

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:03.000
For like, say, you know, Red Lobster

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:05.000
Or something like that

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:07.000
You trade in some DVDs or whatever

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:09.000
And now you have dinner

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:11.000
So it, I don't know

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:13.000
There is benefits to it

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:15.000
And same thing with Walmart

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:17.000
Walmart's going to be doing the same type of thing

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:19.000
Where you get in-store credit

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:21.000
And hey, you know, some of these Super Walmarts

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:23.000
There's your groceries

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:25.000
So I don't see it as a bad thing

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:27.000
And, you know, if anything I do like the fact that

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:29.000
You know, you do have that choice

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:31.000
Where you can buy stuff other than games

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:33.000
Anyway, I want to just throw out there a special note

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:35.000
For the folks that are listening live

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:37.000
Apparently we've had a couple stream cut-outs tonight

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:39.000
While we're taping, I don't know what's going on with that

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:41.000
I just watched one happen

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:43.000
We did get booted on our end and we had to reconnect to the feed

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:45.000
I don't know if we're having

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:47.000
Bandwidth problems in studio

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:49.000
Or if that's something on the shoutcast end

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:51.000
I turned off my torrents

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:53.000
I don't know, it could just be a fluke

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:55.000
But there's nothing we can do here in studio

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:57.000
So we'll just keep doing our thing

01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:59.000
Do the show best we can

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:01.000
But as far as we know, it is not on our end

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:03.000
Alright, so let's

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:05.000
I guess move on with some more news

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:07.000
If we can

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:09.000
Darcy, I know you had some things you wanted to talk about tonight

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:11.000
So let's make sure we get that taken care of

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:13.000
Well this is just a bit of interest

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:15.000
I know that there's people who are fans of the

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:17.000
Serious Sam series

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:19.000
So there's actually a PC version of

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:21.000
Serious Sam HD

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:23.000
That came out for Xbox Live Arcade

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:25.000
It will be released digitally

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:27.000
And also in shops

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:29.000
And the console version

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:31.000
However is not going to be out this summer

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:33.000
So it's going to be there

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:35.000
When it's there

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:37.000
So that's pretty good

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:39.000
Serious Sam is serious

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:41.000
I don't know, it looks kind of cool

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:43.000
Kind of like an old school

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:45.000
Duke Nukem type of game

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:47.000
That they're actually doing something to it

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:49.000
Other than just, let's put it back out

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:51.000
Or, hey, well Duke Nukem

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:53.000
I guess, Duke Nukem 3D did

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:55.000
Like that rewind thing

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:57.000
Which was neat

01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:59.000
And then I stopped playing the game

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:01.000
That's the problem

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:03.000
They need a new Duke Nukem game

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:05.000
For like, Xbox Live

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:07.000
That'd be cool

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:09.000
Rumor is there might be another one in development

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:11.000
That was Duke Zero or something

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:13.000
Did you read that this week?

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:15.000
Yes I did

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:17.000
And my first thought was

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:19.000
Stop ripping off subtitles for Batman

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:21.000
Because seriously it was

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:23.000
Duke Nukem Forever

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:25.000
And then Duke begins

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:27.000
I'm like stop!

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:29.000
And then Duke and Robin, who knew

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:31.000
Exactly

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:33.000
Speaking of Xbox Live, can I say this real quick

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:35.000
I'm sorry DarkSakura, but you would appreciate this

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:37.000
Have you ever played Garou Mark of the Wolves

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:39.000
The game that came out on Xbox Live this week

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:41.000
I know you may not have played it on Xbox Live

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:43.000
Have you played it in the past?

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:45.000
Yeah I think I have the PS2 version

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:47.000
No I have the Dreamcast one

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:49.000
But you realize that some of the characters

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:51.000
In this game have some really funny names

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:53.000
Like who?

01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:55.000
There are some characters

01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:57.000
Like Kim Kap Wan apparently had kids

01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:59.000
And one of them is named Dong

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:01.000
And that's one of the characters you can play

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:03.000
But then there's another character in the game

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:05.000
And the name of the character is

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:07.000
I'm looking for it here

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:09.000
Kushunud Butt

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:11.000
So you can literally play

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:13.000
In this game

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:15.000
Butt vs. Dong

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:17.000
Or Dong vs. Butt if you will

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:19.000
And I know this is so junior high

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:21.000
For me to say

01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:23.000
But what kind of surprised me about this whole thing

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:25.000
The Butt vs. Dong

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:27.000
Is that we still have

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:29.000
This whole controversy going on about

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:31.000
What can and can't be in your profiles

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:33.000
I almost want to put

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:35.000
In my profile Butt vs. Dong

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:37.000
Just to see if I get

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:39.000
You know

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:41.000
A temp ban or something and say what

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:43.000
I was just referencing an epic

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:45.000
Mark of the Wolves fight I had online

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:47.000
Lord

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:49.000
Just saying

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:51.000
If you don't believe me

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:53.000
Go look

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:55.000
I am not making this

01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:57.000
Crap

01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:59.000
I know

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:01.000
I saw it in Rob D's Live Journal

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:03.000
He had a screenshot of it

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:05.000
I'll give credit where credit is due

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:07.000
And I just started laughing and I didn't believe it

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:09.000
I thought it was a photoshop thing

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:11.000
Like he was trying to make a joke I didn't get

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:13.000
So I looked it up on Wikipedia like the characters

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:15.000
As much as I love Fatal Fury

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:17.000
I went and looked it up on Wikipedia and sure enough

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:19.000
There's a character named Butt and a character named Dong

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:21.000
You need to come over

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:23.000
Well you know what after your dinner

01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:25.000
Let's look up the Dreamcast

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:27.000
And get our Garou on

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:29.000
My boyfriend will be so bored

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:31.000
If he's here

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:33.000
He's not much of a gamer we'll see

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:35.000
Why don't we watch a movie

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:37.000
Movie he can do

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:39.000
We'll watch movies

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:41.000
On your sexy blu-ray

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:43.000
God my TV is sexy

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:45.000
Sorry more gaming news

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:47.000
Well I actually do have one other little thing

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:49.000
Sure

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:51.000
You know how we like to make fun of video game movies

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:53.000
You know I just was talking about Silent Hill

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:55.000
I love that movie

01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:57.000
They're doing an Uncharted movie

01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:59.000
It's actually being scripted

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:01.000
By Kyle Ward who already did

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:03.000
Kane and Lynch

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:05.000
Bruce Willis is starring in that

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:07.000
Pretty cool

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:09.000
I like Bruce Willis

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:11.000
Because he's aged better than Harrison Ford

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:13.000
Except for Hudson Hawk

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:15.000
No

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:17.000
Moving forward

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:19.000
But

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:21.000
It's also

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:23.000
Being produced by

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:25.000
Some former

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:27.000
Marvel people

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:29.000
Avi and Ari Arad

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:31.000
Who are also producing

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:33.000
The Lost Planet

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:35.000
They were actually

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:37.000
Going to adapt Lost Planet

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:39.000
To a film

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:41.000
So hey

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:43.000
That might be neat

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:45.000
If they do it right

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:47.000
The whole thing

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:49.000
With this video game to movie

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:51.000
Adaptation

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:53.000
It has to be done right

01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:55.000
You know

01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:57.000
We can't have

01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:59.000
We can't have another

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:01.000
Repeat of

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:03.000
Super Mario Brothers

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:05.000
Oh lord

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:07.000
That's a movie I've never watched

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:09.000
I've seen a few minutes

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:11.000
I've seen like a few minutes

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:13.000
Of the end

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:15.000
I've heard it has funny scenes

01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:17.000
I thought that movie was alright

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:19.000
I've never seen it in theaters

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:21.000
And you know what

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:23.000
So what if the Super Mario Brothers movie

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:25.000
Was crap

01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:27.000
What the hell are you going to do

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:29.000
Plot wise with Super Mario Brothers

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:31.000
I mean seriously

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:33.000
There's nothing that they could have possibly done

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:35.000
That would have made any sense

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:37.000
At all

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:39.000
And you know

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:41.000
Props for them trying to come up with an original idea

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:43.000
To be honest

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:45.000
So it was kind of a rip off

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:47.000
Of Judge Dredd in a little bit

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:49.000
If you look at futuristic

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:51.000
City and stuff like that

01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:53.000
But hey there's references to everything in there

01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:55.000
And you know

01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:57.000
At least they tried

01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:59.000
What is up with your icons?

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:01.000
You know what the default

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:03.000
The default icons on our site come from

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:05.000
That's the default? Oh that's the WordPress one

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:07.000
It's a user generated

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:09.000
Site

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:11.000
I'm never getting rid of my Deadpool

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:13.000
Anyhow was that it for your stories today?

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:15.000
Well not for my stories

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:17.000
But that's all I'm going to talk about for now

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:19.000
Well then we'll come back to you later on in part B

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:21.000
Why don't we?

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:23.000
Alright cause we're going to take a break soon

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:25.000
But I want to get a few more stories out

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:27.000
I know Loki's got a bunch he wants to get through

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:29.000
I'll let him get one more

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:31.000
But let me just give you a couple quick ones here

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:33.000
Because some celebrity deaths

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:35.000
Are crazy around Hollywood

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:37.000
You know if I were in Hollywood right now and on prescription medications

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:39.000
I would be so worried

01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:41.000
For what it's worth

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:43.000
But hey Michael Jackson if you want to

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:45.000
Have something to remember Michael Jackson

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:47.000
By of course we were talking about how art lives on forever

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:49.000
His Thriller video is actually free

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:51.000
Right now

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:53.000
Or did it just end?

01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:55.000
I didn't get on and get the video

01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:57.000
It is an epic music video

01:07:57.000 --> 01:07:59.000
Like I wasn't sitting in my living room

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:01.000
I was in second grade watching it when it aired

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:03.000
When did it end? Wasn't it just today?

01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:05.000
It was today I guess

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:07.000
Today's not over?

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:09.000
Well it's 200 Microsoft points now so

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:11.000
Well it was free

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:13.000
Sorry if you didn't get your hands on it

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:15.000
You know I actually do remember when that aired

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:17.000
I do too MTV used to air the whole darn thing

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:19.000
Well there was a special thing they were doing

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:21.000
It was supposed to air at midnight

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:23.000
And my mom

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:25.000
I was in second grade

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:27.000
And my mom let me stay up to watch it

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:29.000
When it aired at midnight

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:31.000
I kind of agree with

01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:33.000
Frisbee and chat, chat.artisanshredder.com

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:35.000
Just go to YouTube and watch it

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:37.000
If you need to see the Thriller video

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:39.000
Fire up your Playstation 3

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:41.000
And go to the web browser and pull up Thriller on YouTube

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:43.000
There you go, free

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:45.000
In fact lots of Michael Jackson videos

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:47.000
Available for free

01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:49.000
Thanks to the wonders of YouTube

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:51.000
Thank you Frisbee

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:53.000
Appreciate it

01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:55.000
Hey some other stories going on out there right now

01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:57.000
Apparently there is some new developments

01:08:57.000 --> 01:08:59.000
On games coming to Playstation Network

01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:01.000
At least in Japan

01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:03.000
Final Fantasy and Mega Man

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:05.000
And I am talking the old school Final Fantasy game

01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:07.000
That's right Final Fantasy 1

01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:09.000
So I know this is weird because

01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:11.000
Final Fantasy 1 was on the NES

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:13.000
But here's the thing, this is apparently

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:15.000
The Playstation re-release

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:17.000
Or whatever

01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:19.000
Which was the original but with some minor tweaks

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:21.000
It was the one that, it's sort of like what they put out on the PSP

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:23.000
But not what they put out on the PSP

01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:25.000
I want to clarify that

01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:27.000
Because the one they put out on the PSP was like really

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:29.000
It was almost high def and stuff

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:31.000
It was really fancy

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:33.000
They added some dungeons and stuff like that

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:35.000
In the PS1 version or whatever

01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:37.000
But I don't know

01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:39.000
Well now here's the thing

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:41.000
Mega Man 9 actually

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:43.000
Came out in Japan way later than we got it

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:45.000
I don't know how that happened but they did

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:47.000
They got the game a lot later than we did

01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:49.000
They just got it and apparently

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:51.000
There is some type of competition going on

01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:53.000
In Japan right now

01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:55.000
If you enter this competition you get

01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:57.000
Rockman because that's what they call Mega Man over there

01:09:57.000 --> 01:09:59.000
Rockman Complete Works

01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:01.000
It's Mega Man 1 through 6 which I think was some type of

01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:03.000
Playstation compilation they had

01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:05.000
Before the one they had here on

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:07.000
Playstation 2 and GameCube

01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:09.000
Because that's when they added in 7 and 8

01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:11.000
So yeah they have 1 through 6

01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:13.000
Available on a Playstation 1 disc

01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:15.000
But it's now on Playstation Network over in Japan

01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:17.000
So hopefully keep your fingers and toes crossed

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:19.000
Maybe these games will come out over here

01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:21.000
At least that's what people are hoping

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:23.000
My thought? Don't bet on it

01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:25.000
I don't think either of these games are going to come out in the west

01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:27.000
You want to know why? I don't think they're going to go back and bother

01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:29.000
To re-translate them. Why would they? They didn't before

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:31.000
Do you think somebody is really going to go in

01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:33.000
And translate Final Fantasy 1

01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:35.000
Just to release on Playstation Network?

01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:37.000
Fat chance

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:39.000
Didn't they have that over here?

01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:41.000
There was something that was a Final Fantasy collection

01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:43.000
It was a few games

01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:45.000
On the PSP they have Final Fantasy 1 and 2

01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:47.000
No they actually had one on the Playstation

01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:49.000
They had the one that was 5 and 6

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:51.000
And then they had the 4 and Chrono Trigger

01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:53.000
So maybe those will show up

01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:55.000
On Playstation Network

01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:57.000
That's certainly a possibility

01:10:57.000 --> 01:10:59.000
I think it would be actually kind of rad to see

01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:01.000
The 5 and 6 compilation show up

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:03.000
Final Fantasy 6

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:05.000
Not a Final Fantasy game that's been visited in a little while

01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:07.000
And it's one of the greatest if not the greatest Final Fantasy game

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:09.000
Period

01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:11.000
So 4 is getting a lot of attention again thanks to the after years

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:13.000
But 6

01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:15.000
Oh my god if they didn't after years for 6

01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:17.000
I'd be all over that

01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:19.000
Don't even tell me

01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:21.000
I'm still all over 5 by the way

01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:23.000
I still think 5 is the best of them

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:27.000
Let's see

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:29.000
GameGuru says Mega Man Anniversary Edition actually used

01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:31.000
The Rockman Complete Works versions

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:33.000
Of the NES games so they've been translated

01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:35.000
Interesting

01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:37.000
They still won't go back yet

01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:39.000
You know what if they did

01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:41.000
It would be a pleasant surprise

01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:43.000
But at the same time I do own the compilation

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:45.000
On GameCube already

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:47.000
I don't really need it

01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:49.000
Well hey you know what maybe they'll move to

01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:51.000
Since they're going to be doing the digital download

01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:53.000
Stuff now

01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:55.000
Maybe they're going to try to move more towards

01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:57.000
If they do a Playstation 2 emulation

01:11:57.000 --> 01:11:59.000
Or something like that

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:01.000
The full Playstation 2 game downloads

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:03.000
Just like they have with the PS3

01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:05.000
At least with Burnout

01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:07.000
Maybe we'll see that when that happens

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:09.000
I know there's a lot of Mega Man and Final Fantasy

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:11.000
Fans that would love to see these come out

01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:13.000
On Playstation Network

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:15.000
I would say maybe Final Fantasy 1

01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:17.000
For PSP will be on the

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:19.000
Download because all the PSP games are shifting

01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:21.000
To download only I think that's inevitable

01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:23.000
At some point

01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:25.000
I don't know about these exact games

01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:27.000
By the way though I will say this though

01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:29.000
Final Fantasy 1 that Playstation remake is only $6

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:31.000
That's not bad at all

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:33.000
But I'm telling you I don't know how this one was

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:35.000
On the Playstation but if they didn't update

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:37.000
The battle system to the more active

01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:39.000
Time battle that they featured in the PSP

01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:41.000
Remake the more Final Fantasy 4 style battle

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:43.000
I can't like it's so

01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:45.000
Hard to go from what you're used

01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:47.000
To back to old

01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:49.000
School Final Fantasy battle which was

01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:51.000
Like if you attack the monster and the

01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:53.000
Monster dies mid round then

01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:55.000
You lose your attack gets mixing a lot

01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:57.000
Harder back there and

01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:59.000
The whole thing and the magic not being based

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:01.000
Off of MP but a whole different system

01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:03.000
So what if they

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:05.000
When I have to tell you what popped into my

01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:07.000
Head though when you mentioned Final Fantasy

01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:09.000
And Mega Man it's like

01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:11.000
Mega Man in Final Fantasy

01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:13.000
Hey that'd be kind of cool

01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:15.000
So

01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:17.000
Game grew also

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:19.000
As for Final Fantasy is it the Playstation 1

01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:21.000
Version because Final Fantasy Origins came

01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:23.000
Over here no I know that but I'm talking Final Fantasy

01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:25.000
1 not the

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:27.000
It wasn't Origins the 5-6 combo

01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:29.000
4-5

01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:31.000
No 4 and Trigger was another

01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:33.000
thing they called like Final Fantasy

01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:35.000
Chronicles I want to say

01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:37.000
Forgive me if my memory

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:39.000
Is fading it's been many years since that came out

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:41.000
But there was yeah

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:43.000
Well there was a time though that I would have hopped all

01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:45.000
Over this but I had

01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:47.000
The

01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:49.000
I actually bought a wonder swan color

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:51.000
So I could play Final Fantasy

01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:53.000
Still no word on Mystic Quest

01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:55.000
Who cares

01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:57.000
Loki

01:13:57.000 --> 01:13:59.000
You got anything else for us maybe one more story

01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:01.000
Before we go to a break tonight? Yeah sure why not

01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:03.000
Well apparently

01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:05.000
There's some more details coming out

01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:07.000
About No More Heroes 2 and this is

01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:09.000
Coming from Nintendo Power

01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:11.000
And there's

01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:13.000
I guess 3 different plot details

01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:15.000
That I guess can be considered spoilers

01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:17.000
But apparently

01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:19.000
Shinobu the teen

01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:21.000
Assassin from the original game will be returning

01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:23.000
In this sequel

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:25.000
As a playable character her

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:27.000
Fighting style I guess will be different

01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:29.000
Than Travis' and

01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:31.000
She'll move faster it can even jump

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:33.000
And I guess you can play her whenever you want

01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:35.000
They're expecting

01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:37.000
That there's going to be 50 boss battles

01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:39.000
And you'll also be able to play the bosses

01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:41.000
With either character

01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:43.000
And just to mix things up

01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:45.000
And there'll be different cutscenes

01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:47.000
And stuff like that for that

01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:49.000
And then finally it says the primary reason that

01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:51.000
Travis is taking on the United

01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:53.000
Assassins Association again is to

01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:55.000
Avenge the death of his best friend from the first game

01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:57.000
Bishop

01:14:57.000 --> 01:14:59.000
And unfortunately I didn't play through the first game enough

01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:01.000
To probably get to any of those

01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:03.000
Plot points but

01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:05.000
I am kind of

01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:07.000
I want to check out the sequel though

01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:09.000
And probably go back to the first one at some point

01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:11.000
Once again you know that would

01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:13.000
Probably require me to

01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:15.000
Somehow slow down time

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:17.000
Which I don't think I can

01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:19.000
Need more hours in the day

01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:23.000
Let's go ahead and do one more

01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:25.000
I see you have a whole lot of stories there

01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:27.000
We're going to have so much stuff for Part B

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:29.000
Let's do one more

01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:31.000
Australia has decided to

01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:33.000
Block online access to games

01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:35.000
With content beyond the rating

01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:37.000
MA-15

01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:39.000
Apparently this will

01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:41.000
Apply to

01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:43.000
I guess

01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:45.000
Console games

01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:47.000
Also famous MMORPGs

01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:49.000
Such as Second Life and World of Warcraft

01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:51.000
Very well may be affected by

01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:53.000
This new censorship policy

01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:55.000
Wait a minute I thought I heard something about this a while ago

01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:57.000
They were talking about that World of Warcraft would not be playable

01:15:57.000 --> 01:15:59.000
In Australia or something

01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:01.000
Is this like a further development or something?

01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:03.000
Maybe I'm crazy

01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:05.000
I thought I heard something like this before

01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:07.000
Sorry man I don't mean to like

01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:09.000
Move in on the story

01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:11.000
This sounds like we've heard something like this before

01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:13.000
I remember

01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:15.000
They will be

01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:17.000
Very well may be affected

01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:19.000
By this new censorship policy

01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:21.000
If it pushes through

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:23.000
That online games exemption on

01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:25.000
Content ratings is the only reason

01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:27.000
Why multiplayer games with

01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:29.000
User generated environments are possibly in

01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:31.000
This country

01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:33.000
Without it it would take

01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:35.000
One game user anywhere in the world to

01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:37.000
Produce objectionable content

01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:39.000
And the game environment to make

01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:41.000
The Australian government ban the game for everyone

01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:43.000
They're just saying

01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:45.000
Someone's going to ruin it

01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:47.000
But yeah

01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:49.000
Apparently I guess

01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:51.000
Second Life will probably be

01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:53.000
Part of that since

01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:55.000
Second Life is pretty objectionable as it is

01:16:57.000 --> 01:16:59.000
Interesting

01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:01.000
Why did they want to ban it? Just because they can't control it?

01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:03.000
They can't release it?

01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:05.000
Second Life is about to be locked

01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:07.000
It says

01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:09.000
It will be barred under

01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:11.000
The mystery sinister filtering plan

01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:13.000
This is going back to

01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:15.000
The whole MA-15 thing

01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:17.000
Because there is adult content

01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:19.000
In Second Life

01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:21.000
There's two sexy things

01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:23.000
As Destructoid puts it

01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:25.000
There's adult things everywhere

01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:27.000
That looks pretty adult to me

01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:29.000
I don't know

01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:31.000
Well hey before we go to break tonight

01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:33.000
We have a couple things we want to get through

01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:35.000
We got to get to the classic game of the week

01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:37.000
But I also want to get some voicemails out of the way

01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:39.000
Because it's been forever since we played some voicemails

01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:41.000
Here on the show

01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:43.000
And I know we had a few on the line tonight

01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:45.000
That we wanted to play

01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:47.000
And I got to bring up the voicemails here

01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:49.000
First off

01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:51.000
Well just listen

01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:53.000
Just listen to these voicemails that were left on the line

01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:55.000
These are actual phone calls to our Skype line

01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:57.000
When we're not here

01:17:57.000 --> 01:17:59.000
You can call at any time 877-GAME-OLR

01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:01.000
And leave us a message

01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:03.000
Yes hello

01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:05.000
Is this Mr. Roberts?

01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:07.000

Your personal batch of two dozen

01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:23.000

01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:29.000
Happy birthday Rob!

01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:31.000

01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:33.000

01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:45.000

01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:37.000

Black dildos not big floppy

01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:41.000
Black dildos please

01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:43.000
Don't waste my time

01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:45.000
Hey let's go to the next voice mail

01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:47.000

01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:09.000

Well sorry to hear about your fucking work but uh

01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:23.000
Yeah that's a little teaser

01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:25.000

01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:13.000
I guess this is how

01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:15.000
Some of us cope with bad news

01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:17.000
Alright if you want to leave us a voice mail

01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:19.000
1-877-GAME-OL-R

01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:21.000
Oh

01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:23.000
Travis still up to your old

01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:25.000
Shenanigans after all these years

01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:29.000
Anyway

01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:31.000
Let's get to the classic game of the week shall we

01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:33.000
Dark Sakura always likes to take a trip through the archives

01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:35.000
And pick a game that you kids

01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:37.000
Should be checking out and playing every week

01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:39.000
Well you can

01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:41.000
Play the game every week if you want

01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:43.000
But she also gives you a new game each week that you can play

01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:45.000
So here it is

01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:47.000
Dark Sakura's classic game of the week

01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:53.000
So Dark Sakura

01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:55.000
What game should the kids be playing

01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:57.000
This week?

01:21:57.000 --> 01:21:59.000
They should be playing Dragon Force on the Sega Saturn

01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:01.000
Wait like Dragon Force from Guitar Hero?

01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:03.000
No

01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:05.000
Boo

01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:07.000
Let me pull up the audio here real quick

01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:09.000
In the studio

01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:11.000
Tell us a little bit about Dragon Force

01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:13.000
What this game is all about

01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:15.000
Dragon Force is a

01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:17.000
Combination real time and turn based strategy

01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:19.000
Game

01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:21.000
It was actually released in America

01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:23.000
As a working design

01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:25.000
Translation

01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:27.000
We never did get the sequel over here however

01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:29.000
The sequel was pretty freaking good

01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:31.000
But basically

01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:33.000
You play as

01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:35.000
One of this continents eight rulers

01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:37.000
And

01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:39.000
Each ruler of course has a different goal

01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:41.000
One wants to rule the whole thing

01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:43.000
Someone wants to unite everyone

01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:45.000
People want to destroy it

01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:47.000
And so you move along these paths

01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:49.000
From towns to castles

01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:51.000
And you want to capture the castles

01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:53.000
And then you face off in battle

01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:55.000
So you have your

01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:57.000
Strategy tactics

01:22:57.000 --> 01:22:59.000
Where you're moving around

01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:01.000
From

01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:03.000
Town to town across your map

01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:05.000
But then when you

01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:07.000
Get to towns and castles you have your

01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:09.000
Battle and you play as the general

01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:11.000
Commanding their troops

01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:13.000
And so once you

01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:15.000
Get to that part you're

01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:17.000
Commanding these epic battles

01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:19.000
And it's you know you have a

01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:21.000
Also an

01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:23.000
End game week where you do

01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:25.000
Administrative stuff where you tend to your troops

01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:27.000
You know you can increase the number of your troops

01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:29.000
You can pay them more

01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:31.000
You can capture

01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:33.000
Enemy generals

01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:35.000
Join your army, fortify castles that type of stuff

01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:37.000
But the big thing

01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:39.000
Is really the epic battles

01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:41.000
And

01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:43.000
This is probably

01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:45.000
One of the greatest video games

01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:47.000
Of all time in fact

01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:49.000
It won EGM's game of the month award

01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:51.000
In 1986

01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:53.000
If you skip

01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:55.000
Just a little bit

01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:57.000
On that video you can get to the battle

01:23:57.000 --> 01:23:59.000
There you go

01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:01.000
You get to see

01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:03.000
Your big armies and I've actually

01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:05.000
There's battles of larger armies than that

01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:11.000
This game looks different

01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:13.000
It actually is really a lot of fun

01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:15.000
In fact

01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:17.000
It's like you really

01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:19.000
To make this work for radio

01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:21.000
That you kind of watch them like

01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:23.000
There's these big armies

01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:25.000
And they're kind of throwing fireballs

01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:27.000
And things like across this field

01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:29.000
And you watch the TV kind of scroll through this field

01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:31.000
Until it gets to the other army

01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:33.000
It's kind of interesting

01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:35.000
It's like a side scrolling RTS game

01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:37.000
The battles are

01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:39.000
Term based like that

01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:41.000
So you basically

01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:43.000
As you can see in that part now they're actually doing melee

01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:45.000
You know your goal is to

01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:47.000
Capture or kill the other general

01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:49.000
And so

01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:51.000
Each general can attack each other

01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:53.000
They've got their special abilities

01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:55.000
But you can also send your troops to

01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:57.000
Overrun the other too

01:24:57.000 --> 01:24:59.000
You know so whether or not you want to leave yourself

01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:01.000
Defended or whether or not you want to take over

01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:03.000
The other general

01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:05.000
It's pretty neat

01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:07.000
It's like you're commanding your own army

01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:09.000
Actually I think they based

01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:11.000
Did they base Advance Wars sort of off this?

01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:13.000
I think a little bit

01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:15.000
But this definitely

01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:17.000
Kind of thing

01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:19.000
It's epic

01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:21.000
This game is an epic game

01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:23.000
Just like Dragon Force the band

01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:25.000
Which who knows maybe that's where they got their name

01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:27.000
You never know

01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:29.000
Could be but um

01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:31.000
Actually go ahead and link that in the chat room

01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:33.000
Let people take a look at it

01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:35.000
Because really it's something you have to see before you play

01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:37.000
For those of you listening on the podcast

01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:39.000
You can always search for this on YouTube

01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:41.000
Dragon Force is two words

01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:43.000
Just look for Dragon Force Sega Saturn

01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:45.000
Version is very

01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:47.000
Very hard to find

01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:49.000
Very hard to get

01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:51.000
It's a working designs title

01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:53.000
Good luck

01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:55.000
They did do a release for it

01:25:55.000 --> 01:25:57.000
As part of the Sega Ages

01:25:57.000 --> 01:25:59.000
PS2 collection

01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:01.000
But that version isn't Japanese

01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:03.000
I like that the

01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:05.000
Troops rally

01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:07.000
They yell and run into battle

01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:09.000
That's pretty hardcore

01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:11.000
You got your troops falling in battle

01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:13.000
Doing their best to defend their generals

01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:15.000
So it's pretty

01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:17.000
Pretty cool

01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:19.000
So a RTS RPG

01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:21.000
Action-y kind of game

01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:23.000
It's so hard to describe otherwise

01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:25.000
It's very hard to find here in America

01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:27.000
But good luck

01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:29.000
Maybe you'll find something

01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:31.000
Out there that's playable

01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:33.000
Well in Japan it was published by Sega

01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:35.000
But it's a working designs

01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:37.000
Release over here

01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:39.000
Dragon Force is the classic game of the week

01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:41.000
Yes

01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:43.000
And I believe that's all there is to say on that

01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:45.000
So

01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:47.000
That's going to do it for part A tonight of Orange Lounge Radio

01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:49.000
But fear not we have plenty more to get to tonight

01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:51.000
Including the mailbag, the FUs of the week

01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:53.000
Your calls and more gaming news

01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:55.000
And we're going to get to that all

01:26:55.000 --> 01:26:57.000
After a quick break here in studio

01:26:57.000 --> 01:26:59.000
At Orange Lounge Radio

01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:01.000
So stay tuned guys, we'll be right back with more

01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:07.000
Orange Lounge Radio

01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:09.000
Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio

01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:11.000
On this June the 28th of 2009

01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:13.000
Where we're celebrating our 7th anniversary

01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:15.000
Of Orange Lounge Radio

01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:17.000
With nothing of particular or special

01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:19.000
Notice we're just doing the same old crap we always do

01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:21.000
Although we got really in depth tonight

01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:23.000
In part A, kind of having a long side discussion

01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:25.000
But you know we're just kind of

01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:27.000
Just having a really chill night

01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:29.000
No pre-planned list of

01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:31.000
Topics to cover tonight

01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:33.000
We're just doing whatever we want to talk about tonight

01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:35.000
And the latest and greatest in gaming news

01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:37.000
We'll get back into some more news

01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:39.000
I'm hoping Loki has a few more stories for us

01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:41.000
Maybe one more story then I'm sure Jamie's got a couple too

01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:43.000
Sorry I'm reminiscing about

01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:45.000
The steak I had at Daily Grill

01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:47.000
Back during E3 because that was the best

01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:49.000
Steak ever. Where's Daily Grill? I've not heard of that

01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:51.000
Well this was in LA

01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:53.000
But they actually have one in San Francisco and one in Brentwood

01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:55.000
Have you ever been to Ruth Chris?

01:27:55.000 --> 01:27:57.000
Uh

01:27:57.000 --> 01:27:59.000
No. I'm telling you that is an incredible steak

01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:01.000
It's expensive

01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:03.000
If you and the wife go there you're gonna spend 80 bucks

01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:05.000
But it is

01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:07.000
Good steak

01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:09.000
That's my favorite steak right there

01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:11.000
The best steak though, seriously

01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:13.000
Daily Grill, the New York Pepper Steak

01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:15.000
As cracked pepper

01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:17.000
Bacon and onions on top of it

01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:19.000
Oh my god is it

01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:21.000
The best steak ever, I'm serious

01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:23.000
I'm gonna have to check that out at some point

01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:25.000
It is awesome. Wait did you go there this year during E3?

01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:27.000
I went this year during E3

01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:29.000
It was right next to our hotel

01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:31.000
Nice

01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:33.000
Anywho

01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:35.000
We've got some news

01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:37.000
Let's see which we'll pick here

01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:39.000
Um

01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:41.000
How about

01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:43.000
Let's talk about how crappy home is

01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:45.000
Fewer than one in three

01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:47.000
PS3 systems are connected to

01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:49.000
PlayStation Home

01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:51.000
According to Peter Edward

01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:53.000
The director of PlayStation Home

01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:55.000
Europe, PlayStation Home has gained

01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:57.000
7 million users

01:28:57.000 --> 01:28:59.000
worldwide with 3 million in Europe alone

01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:01.000
And

01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:03.000
But you know of course with

01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:05.000
21 million PS3 sold worldwide

01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:07.000
That's you know

01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:09.000
Less than one third so

01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:11.000
He considers it

01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:13.000
You know

01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:15.000
Well he considers home of course

01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:17.000
The starting point for PlayStation 3 online

01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:19.000
Of course I would say he's a little bit

01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:21.000
Biased since you know he is the director of

01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:23.000
PlayStation Home he kind of has to say that

01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:25.000
But um

01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:27.000
I don't know it's just

01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:29.000
If a lot of people are like

01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:31.000
Me they just

01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:33.000
It's neat it's a neat idea

01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:35.000
But

01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:37.000
I don't know I just don't want to go

01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:39.000
To PlayStation Home

01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:41.000
Okay but here's my thing

01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:43.000
Like I realize that's how the blogs are kind of skewing this

01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:45.000
Is that oh nobody's on PlayStation Home

01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:47.000
But since when was 7 million

01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:49.000
A bad number of people to have using your thing

01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:51.000
I mean isn't that actually kind of good

01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:53.000
I mean at risk of sounding like a Sony fanboy

01:29:53.000 --> 01:29:55.000
Is one in three in this case really

01:29:55.000 --> 01:29:57.000
That bad because

01:29:57.000 --> 01:29:59.000
Yes I understand Home is free

01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:01.000
I guess but think about how many people are buying their

01:30:01.000 --> 01:30:03.000
PlayStation 3's let's be honest and here's

01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:05.000
Here's my little you know let's look at both sides

01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:07.000
Of the coin is that I actually think these numbers are

01:30:07.000 --> 01:30:09.000
Pretty good for Home but the bad side is

01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:11.000
I think there's a lot of people that are buying their PlayStation 3's

01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:13.000
Just for Blu-ray players I think their expectations

01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:15.000
Were though that 100% of the people

01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:17.000
Would be well dream the F on

01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:19.000
There are 100 people on Xbox Live

01:30:19.000 --> 01:30:21.000
Well okay granted you have to pay for Xbox Live

01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:23.000
But I would bet there's

01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:25.000
Not even 100% of people

01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:27.000
That have an Xbox profile

01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:29.000
I bet there's a lot of people

01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:31.000
That buy their Xbox 360

01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:33.000
And just put the game in and play

01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:35.000
Because you don't always have to sign into profiles

01:30:35.000 --> 01:30:37.000
And stuff to play games you know what I mean

01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:39.000
Like I bet you there's a lot of folks

01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:41.000
That don't bother with all this other stuff

01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:43.000
That just use their console to play games

01:30:43.000 --> 01:30:45.000
And that's it

01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:47.000
But you know

01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:49.000
It's not the splash they were hoping

01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:51.000
To make

01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:53.000
I just don't think 7 million is that bad of a number

01:30:53.000 --> 01:30:55.000
I got to say

01:30:55.000 --> 01:30:57.000
I'm surprised yeah sj100mat in our chat room

01:30:57.000 --> 01:30:59.000
Chat.orangelandtrader.com says

01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:01.000
There are 7 million PS3 owners

01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:03.000
Actually there's 21 million PS3 owners

01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:05.000
I'm one of them I think we all are

01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:07.000
That's what I actually just said

01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:09.000
All three of us own one

01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:11.000
So it took me a little while

01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:13.000
To get on board

01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:15.000
My question though is this accounts

01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:17.000
Or is this actually users

01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:19.000
You know individual consoles because

01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:21.000
I don't know about you but I have four accounts on my

01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:23.000
You know

01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:25.000
PlayStation 3

01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:27.000
One for each region so I can download you know

01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:29.000
Games in different regions and then one for Nelly

01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:31.000
Yeah but you're an anomaly

01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:33.000
You're not the normal type of player

01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:35.000
You know even if they were counting accounts

01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:37.000
I don't think it would make that big of a difference at the end of the day

01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:39.000
So

01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:41.000
Let's see

01:31:41.000 --> 01:31:43.000
Corypheus in chat says

01:31:43.000 --> 01:31:45.000
And you many of those owners now

01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:47.000
PS3 Paperweight owners

01:31:47.000 --> 01:31:49.000
Were owners of an expensive Blu-ray

01:31:49.000 --> 01:31:51.000
I don't know

01:31:51.000 --> 01:31:53.000
There's still games I've played on PlayStation 3

01:31:53.000 --> 01:31:55.000
When I got mine it was a cheap Blu-ray player

01:31:55.000 --> 01:31:57.000
Yeah I know it was a cheap Blu-ray player at the time

01:31:57.000 --> 01:31:59.000
I didn't pay for mine so

01:31:59.000 --> 01:32:01.000
Can't get much cheaper than that

01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:03.000
Dark Soccer

01:32:03.000 --> 01:32:05.000
Do you have anything you want to cover?

01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:07.000
Actually I do

01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:09.000
My feet with socks no I'm kidding

01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:11.000
They want to expand

01:32:11.000 --> 01:32:13.000
The cameras

01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:15.000
Through a broader online service

01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:17.000
So they want to use

01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:19.000
TV, the cameras, your phones

01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:21.000
And they're thinking of launching that

01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:23.000
Around Spring 2010

01:32:23.000 --> 01:32:25.000
Or at least that's their general idea

01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:27.000
There was an article

01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:29.000
In Fortune about

01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:31.000
What they want to do

01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:33.000
And it's basically saying

01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:35.000
That they want it to be the ultimate multimedia

01:32:35.000 --> 01:32:37.000
Experience

01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:39.000
That, you know, if you have

01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:41.000
The multiple Sony products

01:32:41.000 --> 01:32:43.000
They're all linked together

01:32:43.000 --> 01:32:45.000
Kaz Hirai

01:32:45.000 --> 01:32:47.000
Was actually quoted saying

01:32:47.000 --> 01:32:49.000
That the service will overlay the backbone of the PlayStation

01:32:49.000 --> 01:32:51.000
Network but be broader and more open

01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:53.000
So you'd be able to

01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:55.000
Download movies to TV

01:32:55.000 --> 01:32:57.000
Share photos between devices, friends

01:32:57.000 --> 01:32:59.000
So basically they want to make

01:32:59.000 --> 01:33:01.000
Xbox Live

01:33:03.000 --> 01:33:05.000
But I don't understand

01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:07.000
What's this whole camera supposed to be?

01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:09.000
I don't get it

01:33:09.000 --> 01:33:11.000
They're saying that it's just part of the whole thing

01:33:11.000 --> 01:33:13.000
They want to

01:33:13.000 --> 01:33:15.000
Incorporate all of their electronic

01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:17.000
Products into this big network

01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:19.000
I see, okay

01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:21.000
It's spreading around

01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:23.000
The company brand, why not?

01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:25.000
Where do you think most of those movies come from?

01:33:25.000 --> 01:33:27.000
Sony Pictures, right?

01:33:27.000 --> 01:33:29.000
They're saying that basically they're going to start small

01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:31.000
And work from there

01:33:31.000 --> 01:33:33.000
To just basically

01:33:33.000 --> 01:33:35.000
Get all the different services that function with each device

01:33:35.000 --> 01:33:37.000
And then roll out their plan

01:33:37.000 --> 01:33:39.000
I don't think I would ever

01:33:39.000 --> 01:33:41.000
Buy a camera

01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:43.000
On PlayStation Network

01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:45.000
But, you know, if

01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:47.000
Even only a small handful of people do

01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:49.000
It's not that much resources to probably put this up for sale

01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:51.000
On there, so why not?

01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:53.000
You know what I'd actually like to see do

01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:55.000
If they're really working on networking people

01:33:55.000 --> 01:33:57.000
Is actually have a true

01:33:57.000 --> 01:33:59.000
Teleconference

01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:01.000
Video conference ability

01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:03.000
Kind of do that with Xbox 360

01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:05.000
But that's just one to one, right?

01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:07.000
You can't really do more than one camera chat

01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:09.000
Yeah, it'd be neat though if you could do like

01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:11.000
Your multiple chat room

01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:13.000
Interesting

01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:15.000
Anyway, that's just my idea

01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:17.000
Don't steal my idea, Sony, or I'll stab you in the face

01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:19.000
Shove crayons down your throat

01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:21.000
Well, wait a minute

01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:23.000
Didn't they have the old

01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:25.000
PlayStation 2, wasn't there itoy chat?

01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:27.000
That came out?

01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:29.000
There was

01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:31.000
A late that everyone had moved on

01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:33.000
I think to the next generation of gaming

01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:35.000
And people weren't really talking about itoy chat anymore

01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:37.000
Like I remember

01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:39.000
This was a subject of a lot of mocking early on

01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:41.000
Because it was just, you know, like

01:34:41.000 --> 01:34:43.000
Just we could see

01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:45.000
The potential for abuse in this thing

01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:47.000
And, you know, they had talked about moderation and all that

01:34:47.000 --> 01:34:49.000
I'm wondering, whatever happened

01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:51.000
Did this game actually come out?

01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:53.000
I'm wondering if it didn't just

01:34:53.000 --> 01:34:55.000
Get pulled before it ever came out

01:34:55.000 --> 01:34:57.000
Now I gotta check it out

01:34:57.000 --> 01:34:59.000
I totally gotta check it out now

01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:01.000
I'll research that, you talk about something else, Logie

01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:03.000
Okay

01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:05.000
Let's see

01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:07.000
Apparently there's another rumor

01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:09.000
From the Ars Technica mole

01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:11.000
Saying that there's gonna be some

01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:13.000
Console drops

01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:15.000
Or price drops, at least

01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:17.000
Coming, well, this fall

01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:19.000
For both the PlayStation 3

01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:21.000
And Xbox 360

01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:23.000
Of course

01:35:23.000 --> 01:35:25.000
In the past, the Ars Technica mole

01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:27.000
Has been correct about a few other things

01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:29.000
Including, you know, the

01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:31.000
Capabilities of the PSP Go

01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:33.000
Or the release of the

01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:35.000
Resident Evil 5, Xbox 360 bundle

01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:37.000
And

01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:39.000
I guess the

01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:41.000
360 price drop last fall

01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:43.000
Apparently it says on the Sony's front

01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:45.000
They're claiming that the 80GB

01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:47.000
PS3 will become scarce

01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:49.000
Over the next two months

01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:51.000
And will be mostly replaced by the 160GB model

01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:53.000
And the

01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:55.000
I guess

01:35:55.000 --> 01:35:57.000
Larger model continues to sell into the fall

01:35:57.000 --> 01:35:59.000
And apparently they will simultaneously

01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:01.000
Announce that the

01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:03.000
PS3 Slim

01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:05.000
And

01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:07.000
The even more, I guess

01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:09.000
Rumored price cuts

01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:11.000
Will be announced around the same time

01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:13.000
And

01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:15.000
They don't know how much it's gonna be

01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:17.000
Dropped in price, but they know

01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:19.000
That there will be one

01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:21.000
And also, Microsoft

01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:23.000
Pro system apparently is gonna be

01:36:23.000 --> 01:36:25.000
Phased out

01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:27.000
And something else

01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:29.000
Will come up in its place

01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:31.000
Apparently the Pro will be replaced by

01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:33.000
The 120GB Elite system

01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:35.000
Now wouldn't it be awesome though if they dropped the price

01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:37.000
Of the Elite to the price of the Pro system now

01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:39.000
Then they may come out with something

01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:41.000
Later on that's even more, maybe something

01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:43.000
With Project Intel built in

01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:45.000
I don't know

01:36:45.000 --> 01:36:47.000
Or maybe a slimmer 360

01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:49.000
Who knows, that might be neat

01:36:49.000 --> 01:36:51.000
But apparently

01:36:51.000 --> 01:36:53.000
The 120GB

01:36:53.000 --> 01:36:55.000
Or the 120GB Elite

01:36:55.000 --> 01:36:57.000
Will undergo a price cut

01:36:57.000 --> 01:36:59.000
In September

01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:01.000
And there will be some new bundles coming out in October

01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:03.000
And that makes sense because they're releasing

01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:05.000
New

01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:07.000
Bundles all the time

01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:09.000
By the way

01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:11.000
I did the research on itoy chat

01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:13.000
It's kinda hard to figure it out

01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:15.000
I mean if this game did come out

01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:17.000
It kinda landed with a thud

01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:19.000
It only came out in the UK

01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:21.000
That's what I'm able to kinda put together here

01:37:21.000 --> 01:37:23.000
Is that it did come out in the UK in 2005

01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:25.000
That must have been a long time ago

01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:27.000
I remember selling it so I don't think it actually

01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:29.000
Came out over here

01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:31.000
I do remember selling some really stupid things

01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:33.000
Although itoy chat

01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:35.000
I don't think was ever one of them

01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:37.000
Again I hate to bring up an old subject

01:37:37.000 --> 01:37:39.000
But itoy is what makes me nervous

01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:41.000
Of things like Project Natal

01:37:41.000 --> 01:37:43.000
And these other motion controllers

01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:45.000
Especially Project Natal

01:37:45.000 --> 01:37:47.000
Is pretty much the Sony motion control

01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:49.000
Because the Sony motion control feels to me

01:37:49.000 --> 01:37:51.000
More of a souped up Wii type thing

01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:53.000
Where there's sensors in the controller itself

01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:55.000
And the camera

01:37:55.000 --> 01:37:57.000
But Natal that relies apparently only on a camera

01:37:57.000 --> 01:37:59.000
It makes me nervous because itoy

01:37:59.000 --> 01:38:01.000
Was the camera too

01:38:01.000 --> 01:38:03.000
It was great in theory

01:38:03.000 --> 01:38:05.000
But look how old that camera technology is

01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:07.000
And granted yes the Microsoft vision camera was no better

01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:09.000
Absolutely not better in any way

01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:11.000
In fact I might argue it was worse

01:38:11.000 --> 01:38:13.000
At least the itoy actually

01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:15.000
Might mock the games that came out for it

01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:17.000
At least it had some sport

01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:19.000
I believe that the company that they bought

01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:21.000
I'd rather play itoy chat than totem ball

01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:25.000
Yes totem ball really sucked

01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:29.000
And itoy play was kind of okay

01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:31.000
It was funny

01:38:31.000 --> 01:38:33.000
And hell we used it for our webcam

01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:35.000
For a while

01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:39.000
I'm more confident that they would

01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:41.000
Test this and test this and test this

01:38:41.000 --> 01:38:43.000
They're not going to just

01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:45.000
Splash the market with this

01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:47.000
Project Natal and have it be shit

01:38:47.000 --> 01:38:49.000
I mean why would they do that

01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:51.000
That really opens themselves up

01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:53.000
Whereas itoy I think was more of like

01:38:53.000 --> 01:38:55.000
Hey this is kind of neat

01:38:55.000 --> 01:38:57.000
We'll compete against

01:38:57.000 --> 01:38:59.000
Somebody with this

01:38:59.000 --> 01:39:01.000
But they didn't really do anything with it

01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:03.000
It was just like hey now there's games that use itoy

01:39:03.000 --> 01:39:05.000
DDR hey there's hands and feet mode

01:39:05.000 --> 01:39:07.000
Which sucks

01:39:07.000 --> 01:39:09.000
And yet they decide

01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:11.000
Hey let's do

01:39:11.000 --> 01:39:13.000
Wiimote and nunchuck mode

01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:15.000
Which surprisingly enough also sucks

01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:17.000
And then

01:39:17.000 --> 01:39:19.000
Now there's the Wii balance board mode

01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:21.000
Which also sucks

01:39:21.000 --> 01:39:23.000
So maybe they should go and learn

01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:25.000
Their lesson from this which is

01:39:25.000 --> 01:39:27.000
The extra modes while an interesting idea

01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:29.000
And maybe slightly consider

01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:31.000
Innovative maybe

01:39:31.000 --> 01:39:33.000
As a stretch

01:39:33.000 --> 01:39:35.000
They will always suck

01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:37.000
And 8 arrow mode

01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:39.000
Any guess? It's gonna suck

01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:41.000
Alright well I'm hearing Loki

01:39:41.000 --> 01:39:43.000
Getting a little angry over there so I think it might be

01:39:43.000 --> 01:39:45.000
About time to bring on the FUs of the week

01:39:45.000 --> 01:39:47.000
But how could we do an FUs of the week segment

01:39:47.000 --> 01:39:49.000
Without starting it off with a story about a dumb

01:39:49.000 --> 01:39:51.000
Criminal and yes there was a criminal

01:39:51.000 --> 01:39:53.000
In Pittsburgh where apparently

01:39:53.000 --> 01:39:55.000
In the town of East Liberty somebody

01:39:55.000 --> 01:39:57.000
Tried to break into a GameStop store

01:39:57.000 --> 01:39:59.000
But they didn't do it the old fashioned way

01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:01.000
No they climbed in through the ceiling

01:40:01.000 --> 01:40:03.000
That's right they decided to cut open the ceiling

01:40:03.000 --> 01:40:05.000
In another I guess nearby place in the shopping center

01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:07.000
And climbed into the GameStop

01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:09.000
Basically through the roof but here was the problem

01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:11.000
Once they got into the store they couldn't

01:40:11.000 --> 01:40:13.000
Get out because the front door and the back door

01:40:13.000 --> 01:40:15.000
Were locked and I guess it was not the type of door

01:40:15.000 --> 01:40:17.000
You can unlock from the inside

01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:19.000
You need a key to open that up

01:40:19.000 --> 01:40:21.000
So how did the burglar get out?

01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:23.000
Well they went back through the hole that they made

01:40:23.000 --> 01:40:25.000
They climbed back up through the hole

01:40:25.000 --> 01:40:27.000
They do have surveillance tape but no sign of the criminal yet

01:40:27.000 --> 01:40:29.000
But the thing that makes this most hilarious

01:40:29.000 --> 01:40:31.000
Of all they didn't walk away with a damn thing

01:40:31.000 --> 01:40:33.000
Damn thing

01:40:33.000 --> 01:40:35.000
So uh

01:40:35.000 --> 01:40:37.000
This guy just wasted everybody's time

01:40:37.000 --> 01:40:39.000
In this case and whenever we hear

01:40:39.000 --> 01:40:41.000
About a dumb criminal I'm sure it always

01:40:41.000 --> 01:40:43.000
Inspires us to see a little angsty here on the show

01:40:43.000 --> 01:40:45.000
So uh yeah

01:40:45.000 --> 01:41:03.000
Let's do the FUs of the week

01:41:03.000 --> 01:41:07.000
FU to pain and heat

01:41:07.000 --> 01:41:11.000
Extreme heat

01:41:11.000 --> 01:41:13.000
Whoops didn't mean to cut the music out there

01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:15.000
Um it's hot

01:41:15.000 --> 01:41:17.000
So if you do it being hot

01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:21.000
I would also say FU to the fact that it's hot

01:41:21.000 --> 01:41:23.000
Hotter than hell in here

01:41:23.000 --> 01:41:25.000
Not in here but out there

01:41:25.000 --> 01:41:29.000
And then I would say FU as well to um

01:41:29.000 --> 01:41:31.000
Ah I had something else on my mind

01:41:31.000 --> 01:41:33.000
FU to go to the doctor on my birthday

01:41:33.000 --> 01:41:35.000
That's no fun who wants to go to the doctor for their birthday?

01:41:37.000 --> 01:41:39.000
FU to getting old

01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:41.000
I like the age I was when I started this show

01:41:41.000 --> 01:41:43.000
24

01:41:43.000 --> 01:41:45.000
I think I was then

01:41:45.000 --> 01:41:47.000
31 now what?

01:41:47.000 --> 01:41:49.000
Things get better in your 30s they really do

01:41:49.000 --> 01:41:51.000
I hope you're right

01:41:51.000 --> 01:41:53.000
We'll see

01:41:53.000 --> 01:41:55.000
First of all you don't have the stupid angst you had in your 20s

01:41:55.000 --> 01:41:57.000
And you give less of a fuck the older you get

01:41:57.000 --> 01:41:59.000
I don't know I do still have a lot of that angst

01:41:59.000 --> 01:42:01.000
Once in a while

01:42:01.000 --> 01:42:03.000
I take that back

01:42:03.000 --> 01:42:05.000
I have given less of a fuck the older I get

01:42:05.000 --> 01:42:07.000
How's that?

01:42:07.000 --> 01:42:09.000
I don't give a fuck

01:42:09.000 --> 01:42:11.000
More gaming news

01:42:11.000 --> 01:42:13.000
Do you have anything else tonight Dark Saga?

01:42:13.000 --> 01:42:15.000
Just release dates right?

01:42:15.000 --> 01:42:17.000
Oh god I have that too

01:42:17.000 --> 01:42:19.000
Why don't we just get into release dates here

01:42:19.000 --> 01:42:21.000
Tonight's just kind of a very whatever kind of show

01:42:21.000 --> 01:42:23.000
Fuck it night here on Orange Lounge Radio

01:42:23.000 --> 01:42:25.000
Why not it's our little 7th birthday here

01:42:25.000 --> 01:42:27.000
We're just screwing around tonight

01:42:27.000 --> 01:42:29.000
Dark Saga is going to kick off some release dates

01:42:29.000 --> 01:42:31.000
As soon as she gets it brought up there on her monitor

01:42:31.000 --> 01:42:33.000
Start off with the UK

01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:35.000
And what's coming out overseas across the pond

01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:37.000
Oh yeah it's July isn't it

01:42:37.000 --> 01:42:39.000
Or it will be

01:42:39.000 --> 01:42:41.000
So let's go ahead and start off with our

01:42:41.000 --> 01:42:43.000
Our July releases

01:42:43.000 --> 01:42:45.000
How's that sound?

01:42:45.000 --> 01:42:49.000
Oh god did they actually give me any July releases on here?

01:42:49.000 --> 01:42:51.000
No

01:42:51.000 --> 01:42:53.000
They're not listening to July releases

01:42:53.000 --> 01:42:55.000
Well what good is that?

01:42:55.000 --> 01:42:57.000
Oh there we go

01:42:57.000 --> 01:42:59.000
Sorry

01:42:59.000 --> 01:43:01.000
Brain broken sorry

01:43:01.000 --> 01:43:03.000
The heat has melted her brain

01:43:03.000 --> 01:43:05.000
God I almost did

01:43:05.000 --> 01:43:07.000
Punisher No Mercy on Playstation 3

01:43:07.000 --> 01:43:09.000
We have on the 3rd

01:43:09.000 --> 01:43:11.000
Call of Juarez

01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:13.000
Bound in Blood

01:43:13.000 --> 01:43:15.000
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince

01:43:15.000 --> 01:43:17.000
On a bunch of systems

01:43:17.000 --> 01:43:19.000
Street Fighter IV on PC

01:43:19.000 --> 01:43:23.000
Tiger Woods PGA Tour 10

01:43:23.000 --> 01:43:25.000
And then

01:43:25.000 --> 01:43:27.000
That's it

01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:29.000
Gonna get some Monkey Island after that

01:43:29.000 --> 01:43:31.000
Sweet

01:43:31.000 --> 01:43:33.000
Let's get into some Japanese release dates

01:43:33.000 --> 01:43:35.000
And see what's coming out

01:43:35.000 --> 01:43:37.000
On the other side of the

01:43:37.000 --> 01:43:39.000
Pond over across the Pacific

01:43:39.000 --> 01:43:41.000
Only some price cuts on the

01:43:41.000 --> 01:43:43.000
Xbox 360 this week for Bioshock

01:43:43.000 --> 01:43:45.000
Infinite Undiscovery and Shin Sengoku

01:43:45.000 --> 01:43:47.000
Musou 5 all getting price

01:43:47.000 --> 01:43:49.000
Cuts this week which I believe that

01:43:49.000 --> 01:43:51.000
Last one was Dynasty Warriors if not mistaken

01:43:51.000 --> 01:43:53.000
Yeah that's Dynasty Warriors

01:43:53.000 --> 01:43:55.000
Empires I think or Dynasty Warriors

01:43:55.000 --> 01:43:57.000
Five Empires

01:43:57.000 --> 01:43:59.000
Six Empires

01:43:59.000 --> 01:44:01.000
That is also getting a price drop on the Playstation 3

01:44:01.000 --> 01:44:03.000
For the fancy HD systems

01:44:03.000 --> 01:44:05.000
On the Nintendo Wii this week

01:44:05.000 --> 01:44:07.000
Grand Slam Tennis

01:44:07.000 --> 01:44:09.000
Is really the only game you have to look forward to

01:44:09.000 --> 01:44:11.000
On the Wii this week coming out from EA

01:44:11.000 --> 01:44:13.000
Looks to be a pretty slow week

01:44:13.000 --> 01:44:15.000
Over there in Japan but if you are

01:44:15.000 --> 01:44:17.000
Still a fan of the Playstation 2

01:44:17.000 --> 01:44:19.000
I got nothing for you this week

01:44:19.000 --> 01:44:21.000
But there's a baseball game coming out next week

01:44:21.000 --> 01:44:23.000
You can look for that

01:44:23.000 --> 01:44:25.000
Coming out on the Nintendo DS

01:44:25.000 --> 01:44:27.000
We have Mina no Oekake

01:44:27.000 --> 01:44:29.000
Yasan

01:44:29.000 --> 01:44:31.000
This is going to be some type of drawing game

01:44:31.000 --> 01:44:33.000
Because I recognize the Oekake from being that whole

01:44:33.000 --> 01:44:35.000
Drawing on the internet thing

01:44:35.000 --> 01:44:37.000
That looks to be exactly what this is

01:44:37.000 --> 01:44:39.000
Probably some type of like share with your friends drawing

01:44:39.000 --> 01:44:41.000
Draw a penis on the internet

01:44:41.000 --> 01:44:43.000
It looks like it's teaching you how to draw Oekake

01:44:43.000 --> 01:44:45.000
Is what it's doing because I see this little like

01:44:45.000 --> 01:44:47.000
It's walking you through how to draw

01:44:47.000 --> 01:44:49.000
Like a happy little sheep there

01:44:49.000 --> 01:44:51.000
So that looks like a fun little game

01:44:51.000 --> 01:44:53.000
It's like painting training

01:44:53.000 --> 01:44:55.000
I guess you could call that game

01:44:55.000 --> 01:44:57.000
That's really it on the DS

01:44:57.000 --> 01:44:59.000
Anything on the PSP

01:44:59.000 --> 01:45:01.000
I guess this is a slow week when your biggest release

01:45:01.000 --> 01:45:03.000
Is an Oekake game

01:45:03.000 --> 01:45:05.000
Oh well they do have this game

01:45:05.000 --> 01:45:07.000
Hatsune Miku Project Diva

01:45:07.000 --> 01:45:09.000
Comes out for Sega this week

01:45:09.000 --> 01:45:11.000
You know what Hatsune Miku is right?

01:45:11.000 --> 01:45:13.000
The Vocaloid

01:45:13.000 --> 01:45:15.000
You know where

01:45:15.000 --> 01:45:17.000
You input the words

01:45:17.000 --> 01:45:19.000
The tune and everything and then she sings it

01:45:19.000 --> 01:45:21.000
This looks to be yeah a type of music game

01:45:21.000 --> 01:45:23.000
Actually coming out over there

01:45:23.000 --> 01:45:25.000
Having what's it on?

01:45:25.000 --> 01:45:27.000
PSP

01:45:27.000 --> 01:45:29.000
Yeah having the Vocaloid game on PSP is pretty cool

01:45:29.000 --> 01:45:31.000
Rob really you should

01:45:31.000 --> 01:45:33.000
I'm gonna find you something to play

01:45:33.000 --> 01:45:35.000
Interesting yeah you actually

01:45:35.000 --> 01:45:37.000
Kinda this is a rhythm game that you

01:45:37.000 --> 01:45:39.000
Put in these

01:45:39.000 --> 01:45:41.000
Kinda another type of syncing game

01:45:41.000 --> 01:45:43.000
And it makes your dance

01:45:43.000 --> 01:45:45.000
So check that out

01:45:45.000 --> 01:45:47.000
That would be a big release coming out this week

01:45:47.000 --> 01:45:49.000
Over there in Japan

01:45:49.000 --> 01:45:51.000
That's it for Japanese release dates

01:45:51.000 --> 01:45:53.000
In the US there's

01:45:53.000 --> 01:45:55.000
Kata and Half-Blood Prince

01:45:55.000 --> 01:45:57.000
Which will be on all platforms

01:45:57.000 --> 01:45:59.000
Available for gaming

01:45:59.000 --> 01:46:01.000
Steam Bot Chronicles Battle Tournament

01:46:01.000 --> 01:46:03.000
On the PSP

01:46:03.000 --> 01:46:05.000
So a free release of that

01:46:05.000 --> 01:46:07.000
Or at least a port of the game I guess

01:46:07.000 --> 01:46:09.000
Street Fighter IV on PC

01:46:09.000 --> 01:46:11.000
Two Mega Man Star Force games

01:46:11.000 --> 01:46:13.000

01:46:15.000 --> 01:46:17.000

Vice City

01:46:29.000 --> 01:46:31.000
And San Andreas are all coming

01:46:31.000 --> 01:46:33.000
Together in a brand new

01:46:37.000 --> 01:46:39.000
On PS3 and Xbox 360

01:46:39.000 --> 01:46:41.000
Treasure World

01:46:41.000 --> 01:46:43.000
Which is a DS game that uses

01:46:43.000 --> 01:46:45.000
Your Wi-Fi signals to find treasure

01:46:45.000 --> 01:46:47.000
That's kinda neat

01:46:47.000 --> 01:46:49.000
So that'll be coming out in the DS

01:46:49.000 --> 01:46:51.000
Ruger Twisted Towers

01:46:51.000 --> 01:46:53.000
On the Wii

01:46:53.000 --> 01:46:55.000
And I believe there's another Ruger game

01:46:55.000 --> 01:46:57.000
Coming out in DS

01:46:57.000 --> 01:46:59.000
Now this is a sequel to an Xbox Live Arcade game isn't it?

01:46:59.000 --> 01:47:01.000
I think so

01:47:01.000 --> 01:47:03.000
Blaze Blue Calamity Trigger

01:47:03.000 --> 01:47:05.000
Sort of a launch

01:47:05.000 --> 01:47:07.000
Limited editions coming out on

01:47:07.000 --> 01:47:09.000
PS3 and Xbox 360 as well

01:47:09.000 --> 01:47:11.000
Ummm

01:47:11.000 --> 01:47:13.000
Let's see

01:47:13.000 --> 01:47:15.000
And then a smaller

01:47:15.000 --> 01:47:17.000
360 game that not a lot of people have heard about

01:47:17.000 --> 01:47:19.000
Infernal Hell's Vengeance

01:47:19.000 --> 01:47:21.000
Which was on PC a little bit earlier this year

01:47:21.000 --> 01:47:23.000
That's making its way out to

01:47:23.000 --> 01:47:25.000
Xbox 360 at a budget

01:47:25.000 --> 01:47:27.000
$39.99

01:47:27.000 --> 01:47:29.000
I guess that's not really too budget

01:47:29.000 --> 01:47:31.000
More budget than full price

01:47:31.000 --> 01:47:33.000
Ruger Attack which is on the DS

01:47:33.000 --> 01:47:35.000
Also another Ruger sequel

01:47:35.000 --> 01:47:37.000
Ummm

01:47:37.000 --> 01:47:39.000
And then that's it for this week

01:47:39.000 --> 01:47:41.000
I'm kind of happy to see

01:47:41.000 --> 01:47:43.000
Arma 2 is coming out next week

01:47:43.000 --> 01:47:45.000
And I still haven't gotten a chance to play the

01:47:45.000 --> 01:47:47.000
Actual

01:47:47.000 --> 01:47:49.000
Steam version but

01:47:49.000 --> 01:47:51.000
Looks cool

01:47:51.000 --> 01:47:53.000
Alright so backing up to the Japanese release

01:47:53.000 --> 01:47:55.000
States a little bit, Dark Soccer you sent me this YouTube

01:47:55.000 --> 01:47:57.000
What the hell is this I'm about to look at here?

01:47:57.000 --> 01:47:59.000
This is what the

01:47:59.000 --> 01:48:01.000
Vocaloid is like

01:48:01.000 --> 01:48:03.000
You're gonna turn it up

01:48:03.000 --> 01:48:05.000
Oh

01:48:09.000 --> 01:48:11.000
This is just some really

01:48:11.000 --> 01:48:13.000
Weird version of Don't Worry Be Happy

01:48:13.000 --> 01:48:15.000
Well I picked something in English

01:48:15.000 --> 01:48:17.000
But you input the words

01:48:17.000 --> 01:48:19.000
And the tune and everything

01:48:19.000 --> 01:48:21.000
And it plays it back like she's

01:48:21.000 --> 01:48:23.000
Singing and she's your virtual idol

01:48:23.000 --> 01:48:25.000
Oh interesting

01:48:25.000 --> 01:48:27.000
So you're actually like pushing the buttons to sing?

01:48:27.000 --> 01:48:29.000
No you just input everything

01:48:29.000 --> 01:48:31.000
Ahead of time and then

01:48:31.000 --> 01:48:33.000
Watch it play through

01:48:33.000 --> 01:48:35.000
If there's one of her doing

01:48:35.000 --> 01:48:37.000
Caramel dancing I'll find it

01:48:37.000 --> 01:48:39.000
No thank you that's alright

01:48:39.000 --> 01:48:41.000
But I think that's

01:48:41.000 --> 01:48:43.000
The music maker

01:48:43.000 --> 01:48:45.000
Well the PC ones are I don't know exactly

01:48:45.000 --> 01:48:47.000
How the PSP one is going to be

01:48:47.000 --> 01:48:49.000
But ever since the first one came out

01:48:49.000 --> 01:48:51.000
There's been a ton of

01:48:51.000 --> 01:48:53.000
New Vocaloids and

01:48:53.000 --> 01:48:55.000
Everything it's pretty big

01:48:59.000 --> 01:49:01.000
I think this is what a Dark Soccer

01:49:01.000 --> 01:49:03.000
One is going to show

01:49:03.000 --> 01:49:05.000
I think that's an

01:49:05.000 --> 01:49:15.000
Animation that someone did

01:49:15.000 --> 01:49:17.000
I'm going to park really cute

01:49:17.000 --> 01:49:19.000
But yeah

01:49:19.000 --> 01:49:21.000
Alright let's get back into some more

01:49:21.000 --> 01:49:23.000
News, Loki you got anything for us?

01:49:23.000 --> 01:49:25.000
Yeah sure why not

01:49:25.000 --> 01:49:27.000
Apparently EEA

01:49:27.000 --> 01:49:29.000
Is calling their Sims 3 leak

01:49:29.000 --> 01:49:31.000
It's demo program

01:49:31.000 --> 01:49:33.000
Saying that

01:49:33.000 --> 01:49:35.000
You know you've identified our

01:49:35.000 --> 01:49:37.000
Secret marketing campaign

01:49:37.000 --> 01:49:39.000
EA CEO John

01:49:39.000 --> 01:49:41.000
I'm not even going to try to pronounce

01:49:41.000 --> 01:49:43.000
His last name

01:49:43.000 --> 01:49:45.000
Ricotelio I guess

01:49:45.000 --> 01:49:47.000
That was actually pretty accurate

01:49:47.000 --> 01:49:49.000
It's a large scale

01:49:49.000 --> 01:49:51.000
Form of large scale

01:49:51.000 --> 01:49:53.000
Large scale piracy I guess

01:49:53.000 --> 01:49:55.000
Was a pre-release version of

01:49:55.000 --> 01:49:57.000
The Sims 3

01:49:57.000 --> 01:49:59.000
Basically saying that

01:49:59.000 --> 01:50:01.000
It was a way to

01:50:01.000 --> 01:50:03.000
I guess

01:50:03.000 --> 01:50:05.000
Figure out

01:50:05.000 --> 01:50:07.000
Some data and stuff from this experiment

01:50:07.000 --> 01:50:09.000
That they may

01:50:09.000 --> 01:50:11.000
They've gotten a lot of people to buy the game

01:50:11.000 --> 01:50:13.000
Based on trying this version of the game

01:50:13.000 --> 01:50:15.000
That leaked out I guess

01:50:15.000 --> 01:50:17.000
Apparently if you're a pirate consumer

01:50:17.000 --> 01:50:19.000
They don't get the second town

01:50:19.000 --> 01:50:21.000
They don't get all the extra content

01:50:21.000 --> 01:50:23.000
And they don't get the community

01:50:23.000 --> 01:50:25.000
That's bullshit

01:50:25.000 --> 01:50:27.000
Yes that sounds like complete shit to me too

01:50:27.000 --> 01:50:29.000
Because basically that's all download content

01:50:29.000 --> 01:50:31.000
Funny enough

01:50:31.000 --> 01:50:33.000
Funny enough that he would say that it's a pre-release version

01:50:33.000 --> 01:50:35.000
Because right after the game came out

01:50:35.000 --> 01:50:37.000
That version got leaked too

01:50:37.000 --> 01:50:39.000
So oh shit

01:50:39.000 --> 01:50:41.000
Guess that's not a real

01:50:41.000 --> 01:50:43.000
I don't know

01:50:43.000 --> 01:50:45.000
That didn't fix any problems

01:50:45.000 --> 01:50:47.000
I think it sounds to me like they're making excuses

01:50:47.000 --> 01:50:49.000
Because a leak like this

01:50:49.000 --> 01:50:51.000
Had to have come from inside

01:50:51.000 --> 01:50:53.000
Since it was leaked out like

01:50:53.000 --> 01:50:55.000
Weeks early

01:50:55.000 --> 01:50:57.000
He's doing a cover your ass

01:50:57.000 --> 01:50:59.000
And it just makes him

01:50:59.000 --> 01:51:01.000
Sound pathetic

01:51:01.000 --> 01:51:03.000
So well

01:51:03.000 --> 01:51:05.000
Hey whatever makes you sleep better at night

01:51:05.000 --> 01:51:07.000
I guess

01:51:07.000 --> 01:51:09.000
Yeah it kind of

01:51:09.000 --> 01:51:11.000
Sounds more like uh oops

01:51:11.000 --> 01:51:13.000
How do we explain this one or something

01:51:13.000 --> 01:51:15.000
Ha ha ha you fell for it

01:51:15.000 --> 01:51:17.000
Well I think what he's saying

01:51:17.000 --> 01:51:19.000
Also too is what they're going to try to move towards

01:51:19.000 --> 01:51:21.000
Later on

01:51:21.000 --> 01:51:23.000
Is selling more services

01:51:23.000 --> 01:51:25.000
So meaning like a game like this

01:51:25.000 --> 01:51:27.000
Where you buy a lot of extra additional content

01:51:27.000 --> 01:51:29.000
And stuff

01:51:29.000 --> 01:51:31.000
And I think hey that's not a bad idea

01:51:31.000 --> 01:51:33.000
If you want to say release the game for free

01:51:33.000 --> 01:51:35.000
And then have download content

01:51:35.000 --> 01:51:37.000
That you pay for that makes sense

01:51:37.000 --> 01:51:39.000
But

01:51:39.000 --> 01:51:41.000
At the end of the day what's going to end up happening

01:51:41.000 --> 01:51:43.000
Except they'll probably not sell a lot of that

01:51:43.000 --> 01:51:45.000
And you know what else is going to happen at the end of the day

01:51:45.000 --> 01:51:47.000
Just like all the expansions for Sims 2

01:51:47.000 --> 01:51:49.000
Those will get leaked out as well

01:51:49.000 --> 01:51:51.000
So all your plans for

01:51:51.000 --> 01:51:53.000
Download content

01:51:53.000 --> 01:51:55.000
Will work

01:51:55.000 --> 01:51:57.000
Just to say also everything that's available

01:51:57.000 --> 01:51:59.000
On the Sims 3 store

01:51:59.000 --> 01:52:01.000
Is available for download through BitTorrent

01:52:01.000 --> 01:52:03.000
People have already done it

01:52:03.000 --> 01:52:05.000
People are already doing

01:52:05.000 --> 01:52:07.000
It's just

01:52:07.000 --> 01:52:09.000
It's just

01:52:09.000 --> 01:52:11.000
Really starting but people are already starting to do

01:52:11.000 --> 01:52:13.000
A few custom items already

01:52:13.000 --> 01:52:15.000
It's not going to be too

01:52:15.000 --> 01:52:17.000
Too much longer

01:52:17.000 --> 01:52:19.000
You can download everything

01:52:19.000 --> 01:52:21.000
That's there in the store

01:52:21.000 --> 01:52:23.000
But if you really like the game

01:52:23.000 --> 01:52:25.000
You should just go buy it

01:52:25.000 --> 01:52:27.000
I bought my game

01:52:27.000 --> 01:52:29.000
Encourage them to make a Sims 4

01:52:29.000 --> 01:52:31.000
Although Sims 4 is probably inevitable

01:52:31.000 --> 01:52:33.000
Someday

01:52:33.000 --> 01:52:35.000
Many years down the line

01:52:35.000 --> 01:52:37.000
I just want a nice graphical upgrade to Sims 2

01:52:37.000 --> 01:52:39.000
Sequel to successful franchise?

01:52:39.000 --> 01:52:41.000
Nah

01:52:41.000 --> 01:52:43.000
Well speaking of sequels to successful franchises

01:52:43.000 --> 01:52:45.000
I want them to make pretty faces

01:52:45.000 --> 01:52:47.000
And better hair

01:52:47.000 --> 01:52:49.000
Well I want pretty faces and better hair

01:52:49.000 --> 01:52:51.000
To play that game again

01:52:51.000 --> 01:52:53.000
No not really not with Final Fantasy 14 on the horizon

01:52:53.000 --> 01:52:55.000
But Final Fantasy 11 has been getting some crap

01:52:55.000 --> 01:52:57.000
This week

01:52:57.000 --> 01:52:59.000
Apparently they got sued this week for 5 million dollars

01:52:59.000 --> 01:53:01.000
Apparently it's because they

01:53:01.000 --> 01:53:03.000
Supposedly

01:53:03.000 --> 01:53:05.000
Allegedly I guess is the word to use

01:53:05.000 --> 01:53:07.000
They did to 100,000 customers

01:53:07.000 --> 01:53:09.000
Deceived them for unfair business practices

01:53:09.000 --> 01:53:11.000
False advertising

01:53:11.000 --> 01:53:13.000
And unjust enrichment

01:53:13.000 --> 01:53:15.000
This is Esther Leong

01:53:15.000 --> 01:53:17.000
Who filed the suit in San Francisco

01:53:17.000 --> 01:53:19.000
Claims that Square Enix

01:53:19.000 --> 01:53:21.000
Lied about or concealed its monthly fees

01:53:21.000 --> 01:53:23.000
Penalties for late payments

01:53:23.000 --> 01:53:25.000
Interest restrictions and other things

01:53:25.000 --> 01:53:27.000
That should have been fully disclosed

01:53:27.000 --> 01:53:29.000
At points of purchase

01:53:29.000 --> 01:53:31.000
So that's why they're saying they're deceptive

01:53:31.000 --> 01:53:33.000
And if you go on to read the court filing

01:53:33.000 --> 01:53:35.000
It actually goes on to detail it a little more

01:53:35.000 --> 01:53:37.000
Saying among others

01:53:37.000 --> 01:53:39.000
There's deceptive advertising, unfair and undisclosed

01:53:39.000 --> 01:53:41.000
Business practices, here's a list

01:53:41.000 --> 01:53:43.000
8 items on the list

01:53:43.000 --> 01:53:45.000
Licensing of the online game software disguised as a sale

01:53:45.000 --> 01:53:47.000
Monthly fees or fees to play the online games

01:53:49.000 --> 01:53:51.000
Penalties for late payment of the fees

01:53:51.000 --> 01:53:53.000
Interest charges for late payment of the fees

01:53:53.000 --> 01:53:55.000
Charges while the online game account is suspended

01:53:55.000 --> 01:53:57.000
Termination of the right to use the online games for late payment of the fees

01:53:57.000 --> 01:54:01.000
User restrictions and conditions related to the online games

01:54:03.000 --> 01:54:05.000
Termination of game data for payment of the fees

01:54:05.000 --> 01:54:07.000
Granted, that's not like on the box

01:54:07.000 --> 01:54:09.000
But yeah, it's all in their little fact

01:54:09.000 --> 01:54:11.000
But that's after you bought the game

01:54:11.000 --> 01:54:13.000
But at this point

01:54:13.000 --> 01:54:16.320
at this point when did he buy this game because you know nowadays you can get

01:54:16.320 --> 01:54:22.480
this game and all the expansions for like 20 bucks I mean and really is $20

01:54:22.480 --> 01:54:26.440
worth you know suing over I don't know and so if you will sue about anything

01:54:26.440 --> 01:54:31.000
and if you didn't make your payments well who's fault is that stupid I

01:54:31.000 --> 01:54:35.440
actually whether or not you purchased the game it's sort of like when you

01:54:35.440 --> 01:54:38.960
keep in mind I work in the mortgage industry it's like when you go buy your

01:54:38.960 --> 01:54:43.440
house you know you can pick out your house and you can make all the

01:54:43.440 --> 01:54:46.400
arrangements to purchase that house but you have to sign the agreement to

01:54:46.400 --> 01:54:50.360
actually be able to live in your house you know and in your agreement it says

01:54:50.360 --> 01:54:54.840
that you are paying for this this and this that your lender has the right to

01:54:54.840 --> 01:54:57.120
church this isn't this if you don't do shit

01:54:57.120 --> 01:55:01.240
guess what same way in that type of contract you have to read it

01:55:01.240 --> 01:55:04.760
this person has no right to sue she's completely responsible for her own and

01:55:04.760 --> 01:55:08.920
and they they even ask you when you're signing up did you know be sure to read

01:55:08.920 --> 01:55:14.760
this contract do you accept these terms and you know whatever it's not their

01:55:14.760 --> 01:55:17.320
fault she didn't read it well this is what I don't understand I played this

01:55:17.320 --> 01:55:23.040
game for three years I had when I never heard of them charging interest not a

01:55:23.040 --> 01:55:27.320
single person in my league shall ever talked about this if it is really late

01:55:27.320 --> 01:55:33.040
payments I guess but if you pay late there's no paying late you pay a lot of

01:55:33.040 --> 01:55:37.520
pay disable your account you want to pay right and if your credit card bounces or

01:55:37.520 --> 01:55:43.640
whatever you can log in yeah but like I don't know do they charge you before the

01:55:43.640 --> 01:55:47.360
new month is up say like I pay for a month or whatever like that they charge

01:55:47.360 --> 01:55:49.480
in the beginning of the other month because if they charge me at the end of

01:55:49.480 --> 01:55:52.560
the month then you know you've paid for that month and you have you owe the

01:55:52.560 --> 01:55:56.240
money I guess for that I think the beginning of the month makes sense I

01:55:56.240 --> 01:56:00.880
don't understand I think we need to hear more about what's the way it's worded it

01:56:00.880 --> 01:56:04.880
makes it sound like a dummy and on top of all that five million dollars really

01:56:04.880 --> 01:56:09.280
for something that sounds like that they just fucked up and didn't pay their bill

01:56:09.280 --> 01:56:15.960
customer service could just resolved well maybe that's the problem but you

01:56:15.960 --> 01:56:19.440
know I don't know yeah five million dollars a little extreme but I mean if

01:56:19.440 --> 01:56:23.460
it's being split among a hundred thousand people is class action right so

01:56:23.460 --> 01:56:26.340
technically all hundred thousand should be entitled to their chunk of it so they

01:56:26.340 --> 01:56:31.560
all get what 50 bucks a pop 5,000 is that much I can't do math sorry yeah

01:56:31.560 --> 01:56:36.440
but still well wait I think it's still 50 times a hundred thousand I think it's

01:56:36.440 --> 01:56:41.640
still highly frivolous well it's still a 50 bucks that's you know and they're not

01:56:41.640 --> 01:56:48.240
gonna get $50 either because lawyers got to get paid I've let's see going in chat

01:56:48.240 --> 01:56:53.220
for our comments chat that orange entree calm Joshi 16 in chat says people sue

01:56:53.220 --> 01:57:00.840
over $0 GS 68 says people make patents sit on them then sue GS 68 is saying he's

01:57:00.840 --> 01:57:04.260
gonna patent eighth-generation game consoles then get ready to sue Sony

01:57:04.260 --> 01:57:09.760
Microsoft and Nintendo so we'll see how that works out for you how about the

01:57:09.760 --> 01:57:13.400
mailbag I think it's time we get to some emails you haven't even have an email

01:57:13.400 --> 01:57:16.680
bag yet all right we do one more story then we get to the meal yeah I'm pulling

01:57:16.680 --> 01:57:20.000
it now look you got another story for us in the meantime yes apparently there's

01:57:20.000 --> 01:57:24.200
an off-broadway play that's been inspired by adventure games apparently

01:57:24.200 --> 01:57:30.720
it's a how off-broadway pretty off-broadway I guess it's called

01:57:30.720 --> 01:57:35.460
adventure quest and explores the convention set by Sierra's adventure

01:57:35.460 --> 01:57:40.040
games back in time of well the 90s I guess how is that different from like

01:57:40.040 --> 01:57:46.600
just a fairy tale I don't know it's sort of like I guess into the woods they say

01:57:46.600 --> 01:57:52.160
oh yeah I know that play that's that's kind of a spoof on well I guess fairy

01:57:52.160 --> 01:57:56.120
tales actually is what into the woods is about yeah but apparently I guess this

01:57:56.120 --> 01:58:00.000
is currently playing at the brick theater as part of the anti-depressant

01:58:00.000 --> 01:58:04.840
festival and it will be part of their theaters gameplay celebration in which

01:58:04.840 --> 01:58:09.000
they have a they will have a variety of video game related performances

01:58:09.000 --> 01:58:14.000
including let's take a look here this has got to be one of those theaters

01:58:14.000 --> 01:58:18.640
that's like only seats 20 people in it you know like it's a real tiny tiny

01:58:18.640 --> 01:58:23.240
community theater I can't imagine this is a big production they're gonna have

01:58:23.240 --> 01:58:28.200
yes the gameplay celebration is apparently three performances executed

01:58:28.200 --> 01:58:32.560
through video games in video game styles three video game or three game party

01:58:32.560 --> 01:58:38.240
nights and three weeks of rot your brain video game madness and apparently their

01:58:38.240 --> 01:58:43.400
video game party nights include an MMORPG night where you will play your

01:58:43.400 --> 01:58:49.200
favorite massively multiplayer online role-playing game in theater rock band

01:58:49.200 --> 01:58:54.280
karaoke and then another night will be a chiptunes dance party that sounds fun

01:58:54.280 --> 01:58:58.800
but this sounds so off-broadway it's like in New Jersey what's kind of neat

01:58:58.800 --> 01:59:04.440
though is like what they have like it's live actors on stage with like no set

01:59:04.440 --> 01:59:08.960
work and then the sets are actually like artwork from like adventure games which

01:59:08.960 --> 01:59:14.600
is kind of neat okay that's kind of neat I guess what a bunch of nerds but I can

01:59:14.600 --> 01:59:17.840
applaud where I want to talk and they actually it's kind of cool they've got

01:59:17.840 --> 01:59:24.320
like a little score tally running and nice all right we ready for some emails

01:59:24.320 --> 01:59:28.000
yeah all right whenever you want to interact with the show mailbag at

01:59:38.560 --> 01:59:42.680
Rob mailbag at orangeslaunasrated.com

01:59:46.920 --> 01:59:52.120
first email I just listened to last week's show and I would compare it more

01:59:52.120 --> 01:59:55.560
to doom and the start of the first-person shooter genres about being

01:59:55.560 --> 02:00:00.480
a BB&A versus DJ hero when a new when a new game genre first appears to the

02:00:00.480 --> 02:00:04.400
general public it seems like the best way to classify is by calling it a clone

02:00:04.400 --> 02:00:09.120
of the first most popular game in the genre for more recent example look at

02:00:09.120 --> 02:00:13.920
how sandbox games were called GTA clones until a few years ago and that's from

02:00:13.920 --> 02:00:19.480
Corky842 who also sends an addendum ps the last email was brought to you by

02:00:19.480 --> 02:00:27.120
beer in the palm pre Wow I don't know if I have a lot else to add to that that's

02:00:27.120 --> 02:00:30.840
an interesting comparison I didn't even think of the doom like the whole like

02:00:30.840 --> 02:00:34.760
doom quake Wolfenstein type of connection last week but very interesting

02:00:34.760 --> 02:00:47.680
point um cheeseburger says I miss MJ dude you're too young this one says hey

02:00:47.680 --> 02:00:53.080
y'all I downloaded the new iPod touch firmware tonight first of all I paid 10

02:00:53.080 --> 02:00:58.760
bucks for this why is this really good or am I an apple lemming or both the

02:00:58.760 --> 02:01:02.160
second this update actually looks interesting the copy and paste is not

02:01:02.160 --> 02:01:07.000
really what I'm used to but what was I expecting parental controls are good if

02:01:07.000 --> 02:01:12.240
you're a parent as I am NOT it's useless to me the shake to shuffle feature is

02:01:12.240 --> 02:01:18.920
nice though and really useful when my baby's crying album kicks in well that

02:01:18.920 --> 02:01:26.120
that's awesome for Apple to charge for firmware updates I didn't pay for mine

02:01:26.120 --> 02:01:30.840
you don't pay on the phones you only pay on the I touch or whatever oh well how

02:01:30.840 --> 02:01:36.840
generous of them I know I don't care I have the phone yes third assuming you

02:01:36.840 --> 02:01:41.040
didn't cut me off with the baby comment they've done something to improve typing

02:01:41.040 --> 02:01:45.320
messages and I love them for it landscape typing makes the buttons

02:01:45.320 --> 02:01:49.000
noticeably bigger and improvement that helps me a lot now I don't miss type

02:01:49.000 --> 02:01:52.400
every other word yay well that's all for now

02:01:52.400 --> 02:01:59.000
steak hair entertainment this message was typed an iPod touch which I have and

02:01:59.000 --> 02:02:04.320
you don't ask yeah I have an iPhone actually I do really like the the

02:02:04.320 --> 02:02:12.600
upgrade I like having five panels for my apps instead of the three and I'm pretty

02:02:12.600 --> 02:02:17.120
pleased with it pretty pleased also I really like some of the changes that

02:02:17.120 --> 02:02:21.920
they've made to the it's okay I like that I can text and landscape now that's

02:02:21.920 --> 02:02:25.960
the biggest new improvement same with email but I'm not liking the fact that

02:02:25.960 --> 02:02:29.240
the phone just seems to run slower like I guess with all that stuff in there

02:02:29.240 --> 02:02:32.880
like a lot of my apps feel like they're running slower but I'm hoping that'll

02:02:32.880 --> 02:02:38.160
get showing an improvement I'm hoping that with the 3.1 that's inevitable at

02:02:38.160 --> 02:02:42.320
some point you know the minor tweaks that'll fix that all up that's what I

02:02:42.320 --> 02:02:48.560
hope next email sure dear olr crew I just wanted to briefly chime in on

02:02:48.560 --> 02:02:52.880
something you went over last week that being guitar hero Van Halen I remember

02:02:52.880 --> 02:02:57.520
when they announced the game I was actually somewhat interested though that

02:02:57.520 --> 02:03:01.840
interest dropped completely when it said the game was Van Halen and not Van

02:03:01.840 --> 02:03:08.040
Hagar you know what I love Sammy Hagar most the music by them that I love is

02:03:08.040 --> 02:03:11.120
when Sammy Hagar was the lead singer there's only a couple of songs that I

02:03:11.120 --> 02:03:16.480
enjoyed that were when David Lee Roth was singing with the group I completely

02:03:16.480 --> 02:03:21.200
agree with this by the way and so I suppose that in the opinion of many I'm

02:03:21.200 --> 02:03:26.520
not a true fan of the group that is just my own musical taste perhaps now there

02:03:26.520 --> 02:03:30.080
might be an opportunity for rock band to pick up the remaining music I'd freaking

02:03:30.080 --> 02:03:34.880
love to play dreams thanks for reading it's always awesome for PS I just want

02:03:34.880 --> 02:03:38.760
to know that it was very painful news on Thursday June 25th when Michael Jackson

02:03:38.760 --> 02:03:43.020
died may he rest in peace but forever live on through his music and what a

02:03:43.020 --> 02:03:46.420
great tribute that would be if harmonics gave us the real of the thriller album

02:03:46.420 --> 02:03:51.800
is rock band DLC don't count on it now on a wishful thinking I realize

02:03:51.800 --> 02:03:56.320
everybody's still wrapped up you know I don't want to get into this topic but

02:03:56.320 --> 02:03:59.880
everybody's still wrapped up in the Michael Jackson thing don't count on it

02:03:59.880 --> 02:04:03.240
something like that is gonna be years and years in the making because guess

02:04:03.240 --> 02:04:08.160
what to the rights to that stuff now it's all gonna be up in the air with the

02:04:08.160 --> 02:04:12.600
debt that man left behind if rumors are to be believed it these type of

02:04:12.600 --> 02:04:18.360
struggles will go on for years did you see misty sent us clips no I didn't

02:04:18.360 --> 02:04:21.840
misty sent us a bunch of clips I think that you should hop into the mailbag too

02:04:21.840 --> 02:04:27.440
I might oh my gosh Wow I might have to play those during the afterbirth night

02:04:27.440 --> 02:04:36.700
all right okay Thank You misty well I thought he's so rich but his company's

02:04:36.700 --> 02:04:41.400
bankrupt kind of I to be honest I don't know nor do I feel like it's any my

02:04:41.400 --> 02:04:46.000
business I kind of don't care but you know I sound rude but you know it's not

02:04:46.000 --> 02:04:49.360
my finances I got I got my own finances to worry about well we've got two more

02:04:49.360 --> 02:04:54.840
emails hi lol crew this is your friendly neighborhood Mexican act daft first of

02:04:54.840 --> 02:04:58.320
all I want to congratulate you for your seventh anniversary I've been listening

02:04:58.320 --> 02:05:03.000
to the show since 2005 though I became a regular since 2006 around episode 200 I

02:05:03.000 --> 02:05:08.720
wish you the best for the years to come thank you acts daft well now to business

02:05:08.720 --> 02:05:14.480
ooh so serious well we have all seen and heard the news on the newest DDR and the

02:05:14.480 --> 02:05:19.260
latest Bemani news and how disappointing it has been how DDR has burned to the

02:05:19.260 --> 02:05:22.680
ground and possibly lost its appeal to the true old fans of the series and

02:05:22.680 --> 02:05:27.400
localization of pop music in the States which is a joke for those who know about

02:05:27.400 --> 02:05:31.920
the game well call me crazy and stuff but now I'm glad Konami didn't bring

02:05:31.920 --> 02:05:36.080
guitar freaks in germania stateside that way we got guitar hero and rock band

02:05:36.080 --> 02:05:39.800
which are truly great and haven't lost their appeal to the public no matter how

02:05:39.800 --> 02:05:43.640
much activision is milking guitar hero though they did bring guitar freaks

02:05:43.640 --> 02:05:49.240
germania to this you know side of the pond I guess in the arcades yes in the

02:05:49.240 --> 02:05:55.200
arcades but also as rock revolution unfortunately that doesn't count I still

02:05:55.200 --> 02:05:58.160
look at because no one cared about that anyway I still wondered what would have

02:05:58.160 --> 02:06:03.880
happened if konami would konami bro guitar Dora but considering how rock

02:06:03.880 --> 02:06:08.080
revolution did see there we go I'm glad they didn't granted it wouldn't have

02:06:08.080 --> 02:06:12.400
been the same game but still look at the way DDR and pop music are going not good

02:06:12.400 --> 02:06:16.360
at all and a guitar freaks germania would have taken the same route and

02:06:16.360 --> 02:06:20.740
doomed the rhythm games for years to come so thank you konami for not giving

02:06:20.740 --> 02:06:24.980
us guitar freaks in germania rock revolution proved what it what it would

02:06:24.980 --> 02:06:28.960
have happened to guitar over the years now don't screw up and don't release

02:06:28.960 --> 02:06:33.760
another bad part of beat mania because of scratch and DJ hero heck forget about

02:06:33.760 --> 02:06:38.360
the money in the States and let k set jay do their thing at least they know if

02:06:38.360 --> 02:06:43.800
the record breaks don't try to fix it thanks thanks for reading this email

02:06:43.800 --> 02:06:47.560
again congrats on the seven years entertaining the internet every Sunday

02:06:47.560 --> 02:06:52.080
PS adjacent Enos were dead he'd be rolling in his grave right now well he's

02:06:52.080 --> 02:06:57.720
not he's alive and well he's um he's at EA now I think I can say that he's moved

02:06:57.720 --> 02:07:04.200
on to a better place yes um look I I don't know if I agree very much with the

02:07:04.200 --> 02:07:09.480
whole rock revolution is what guitar freaks would have become like although I

02:07:09.480 --> 02:07:13.120
can totally see the point about maybe if this game had come out first it would

02:07:13.120 --> 02:07:16.840
have hurt the chances for things in the future I can sort of kind of go with

02:07:16.840 --> 02:07:20.600
that I guess but I don't think that rock revolution would have happened if it

02:07:20.600 --> 02:07:24.480
weren't for guitar freaks I think I don't think rock revolution honestly

02:07:24.480 --> 02:07:29.040
outside of music alone I don't think it had anything to do with guitar freaks at

02:07:29.040 --> 02:07:35.000
all rock revolution was an attempt to make a copy of guitar hero and use the

02:07:35.000 --> 02:07:38.920
Bahmani brand to do it knowing that they wouldn't be able to say anything about

02:07:38.920 --> 02:07:42.200
it because Konami did have guitar freaks they did have the Bahmani

02:07:42.200 --> 02:07:49.400
thing and just that they just just piss poor execution stop being lazy and

02:07:49.400 --> 02:07:53.040
hopefully you know they're learning their lesson when it's this is this game

02:07:53.040 --> 02:07:57.800
is an embarrassment rock revolution was there's really no nice way for me to say

02:07:57.800 --> 02:08:02.160
it with as much nice things as you know Konami has put out in the past and

02:08:02.160 --> 02:08:06.200
people that I even know there and so on there is no nice way for me to say it

02:08:06.200 --> 02:08:11.880
rock revolution was an embarrassment to that company and it should never happen

02:08:11.880 --> 02:08:18.040
again anyhow any more emails oh yes we did

02:08:18.040 --> 02:08:24.680

wanted to congratulate and praise you on your seventh anniversary it's amazing

02:08:29.640 --> 02:08:33.800
that it was a little less than six years ago that I first started listening to

02:08:33.800 --> 02:08:38.000
the show I first discovered OLR through a friend who recommended the now long

02:08:38.000 --> 02:08:42.000
defunct Wednesday show outside the box from there I discovered the Sunday show

02:08:42.000 --> 02:08:46.120
and the rest was history I know you guys get enough praise as it is and for the

02:08:46.120 --> 02:08:50.400
sake of this email I will keep it short no I like praise keep keep it I like

02:08:50.400 --> 02:08:54.800
that somebody remembers outside the box I barely remember that show that's crazy

02:08:54.800 --> 02:08:58.680
I was a sideshow I hosted years ago with some friends and you three have

02:08:58.680 --> 02:09:02.000
sacrificed seven years of your Sunday nights for the sake of us the listener

02:09:02.000 --> 02:09:06.160
and have never asked for anything in return we the listeners can never make

02:09:06.160 --> 02:09:10.000
that amount of dedication up to you except to continue to listen tell to

02:09:10.000 --> 02:09:13.920

02:13:46.720 --> 02:13:58.480

game stories let's see offensive things you've missed some of you guys may be

02:14:24.800 --> 02:14:27.880

sky yeah actually that's true but now it is the oldie and moldy Wednesday

02:14:32.240 --> 02:14:35.840
flashback where we are 100 episodes behind right now so you can hear what

02:14:35.840 --> 02:14:40.720
the show sounded like two years ago it's pretty nuts I kind of looked at the chat

02:14:40.720 --> 02:14:44.320
and some of the response to last week's episode and I think I think Missy or

02:14:44.320 --> 02:14:47.640
somebody had said it's a good thing I wasn't there because I would have ripped

02:14:47.640 --> 02:14:52.280
them a new asshole so so here what offensive things you missed out on on

02:14:52.280 --> 02:14:56.160
back on episodes 20 and 21 and all that stuff we're playing way back when so

02:14:56.160 --> 02:15:00.040
check it out it was on our old old station we used to play shows that were

02:15:00.040 --> 02:15:04.600
like three years old and I don't even know like a we lost a ton of shows when

02:15:04.600 --> 02:15:08.600
one of our hard drives went out so it's which is a bummer they might still be

02:15:08.600 --> 02:15:11.560
around you know who added me on Twitter the other day was DDR angel and if

02:15:11.560 --> 02:15:15.200

Skype it well Skype it were there any of the big stories we haven't got to yet

02:18:09.800 --> 02:18:13.960
Loki or do you think we got it all code who's coming out next week at some point

02:18:13.960 --> 02:18:19.040
that's at a game making software that's going to be available on Xbox community

02:18:19.040 --> 02:18:23.120
or indie games whatever it's called at the moment really for 400 Microsoft

02:18:23.120 --> 02:18:27.320
points five bucks hell yes I will be picking that up that's supposed to be

02:18:27.320 --> 02:18:29.840
coming out sometime around June 30th they're actually going through the same

02:18:29.840 --> 02:18:34.680
peer review process as every other developer has to go through so they're

02:18:34.680 --> 02:18:39.680
targeting it for some time June 30th ish you know might not be exactly June 30th

02:18:39.680 --> 02:18:46.960
but that's kind of cool very cool let me cover a couple quick stories here real

02:18:46.960 --> 02:18:50.680
quick before we go to the Skype line let's see our con is coming to the

02:18:50.680 --> 02:18:53.880
iPhone which makes me very happy because I remember this game for the Commodore

02:18:53.880 --> 02:18:57.640
64 I think it actually did just come out because my friend was showing me that he

02:18:57.640 --> 02:19:03.320
bought it the other day it is out for $4 for the iPhone and the iPod touch and

02:19:03.320 --> 02:19:08.280
that is available no multiplayer sadly but you can download this and play it on

02:19:08.280 --> 02:19:13.120
the iPhone I'm wondering how smoothly it runs but yeah oh god I'd love to our con

02:19:13.120 --> 02:19:15.700
I know I've talked about on the show before it was like it was like chess but

02:19:15.700 --> 02:19:19.840
the pieces would actually battle each other but not like regular chess you had

02:19:19.840 --> 02:19:24.480
different types of pieces like basilisks and unicorns and shape shifters and all

02:19:24.480 --> 02:19:28.960
this cool stuff well I've got a few more stories here real quick sure there's a

02:19:28.960 --> 02:19:32.280
rumor that one versus 100 is coming out of beta next week and we'll actually be

02:19:32.280 --> 02:19:39.840
giving prizes so that'd be cool ah I bet that's not true I think there's gonna be

02:19:39.840 --> 02:19:43.360
more of a build-up to it than just oh hey next week prizes I think they'll be

02:19:43.360 --> 02:19:47.440
more of a build-up I know I heard that the guy supposedly said something

02:19:47.440 --> 02:19:52.000
whatever it doesn't mean anything bit trip core is gonna be coming out in two

02:19:52.000 --> 02:19:57.280
weeks and they'll be the 100th we wear game on the service that's kind of neat

02:19:57.280 --> 02:20:00.720
bit trip beat was kind of cool I'm wondering how this is gonna be different

02:20:00.720 --> 02:20:03.920
I said are they changing anything it's a totally different type of game

02:20:03.920 --> 02:20:10.440
interesting yeah okay and of course I'm sure you saw this already

02:20:10.440 --> 02:20:16.700
Namco networks is giving burger time an update with burger time deluxe yes I

02:20:16.700 --> 02:20:21.080
heard about this I've heard a lot of people call it crap but burger time was

02:20:21.080 --> 02:20:25.000
an awesome game in the 80s but you know even I can admit it's probably one of

02:20:25.000 --> 02:20:30.320
those things that's better left in the 80s but I will check this out but it

02:20:30.320 --> 02:20:33.880
just looks like the old game was souped up graphics in new stages which you know

02:20:33.880 --> 02:20:37.280
it's not like the stages are that complicated yeah it's probably and then

02:20:37.280 --> 02:20:40.160
finally last thing oh actually got two things

02:20:40.160 --> 02:20:45.040
Bethesda their parent company bought ID software so now that's kind of under the

02:20:45.040 --> 02:20:50.040
whole ZeniMax I guess was the company that owns Bethesda now they own it's

02:20:50.040 --> 02:20:57.840
software as well and apparently the next two games rage and Wolfenstein obviously

02:20:57.840 --> 02:21:02.320
are gonna be published under their respective publishers EA and Activision

02:21:02.320 --> 02:21:06.840
but now all the further games are being published under probably like Bethesda

02:21:06.840 --> 02:21:10.760
or something like that I don't know ZeniMax unless ZeniMax has come out as a

02:21:10.760 --> 02:21:17.160
new publisher I guess apparently if you were a subscriber to EGM and since EGM

02:21:17.160 --> 02:21:21.720
is kind of gone right now your subscriptions were converted into Maxim

02:21:21.720 --> 02:21:26.880
subscriptions which I think is a fair trade if you ask me so that's kind of

02:21:26.880 --> 02:21:32.840
neat and then still yet another survey suggesting that Netflix streaming is

02:21:32.840 --> 02:21:36.880
coming to the Wii the only difference we get this damn survey like every six

02:21:36.880 --> 02:21:40.920
months the only difference now is instead of a one-time fee of $9.99 it

02:21:40.920 --> 02:21:46.000
will be free so you will not have to purchase a streaming disc but hey if it

02:21:46.000 --> 02:21:50.160
happens it happens cool and then finally Ubisoft that would make the Wii a little

02:21:50.160 --> 02:21:53.760
more lucrative than 360 because you wouldn't have to have gold very true

02:21:53.760 --> 02:21:58.520
that that's a that's a big feather in Wii's cap don't underestimate that

02:21:58.520 --> 02:22:04.200
don't underestimate that can't do HD streaming though for most you know what

02:22:04.200 --> 02:22:08.520
considering the type of stuff that's there and I'm just gonna say don't

02:22:08.520 --> 02:22:12.920
underestimate that I'm very critical of the Wii on this show but that could be

02:22:12.920 --> 02:22:16.520
big free Netflix essentially if you already have a Netflix account Rob how

02:22:16.520 --> 02:22:20.520
long does it take for the internet browser to load up and you know the Wii

02:22:20.520 --> 02:22:23.720
I mean what if they can if you'll whip it if they can figure out the

02:22:23.720 --> 02:22:26.880
connectivity that makes you know games like Super Smash Brothers and stuff work

02:22:26.880 --> 02:22:32.840
for like kids programming and non HD type stuff again don't underestimate it

02:22:32.840 --> 02:22:36.920
Matt all right big and then finally a Ubisoft's collaboration with Q

02:22:36.920 --> 02:22:42.400
Entertainment they are like it's likely to be a music game but me really when

02:22:42.400 --> 02:22:47.280
you look at odds Q entertain exactly I mean unless it's 99 nights to which is

02:22:47.280 --> 02:22:51.200
somehow doubt no all right look our skype lines already ringing off the

02:22:51.200 --> 02:22:54.080
hook and I really want to get to that very soon but one other quick story for

02:22:54.080 --> 02:22:58.200
you guys if I could Marvel vs. Capcom 2 big rumors out there that the game was

02:22:58.200 --> 02:23:03.680
coming out June 29th not true per the Twitter's official Capcom Twitter is not

02:23:03.680 --> 02:23:06.640
coming out June 29th they don't know where the rumor came from well let me

02:23:06.640 --> 02:23:09.880
tell you it was from Marvel's financial reports you might want to look at that

02:23:09.880 --> 02:23:12.880
but they're saying now it's closer to the end of July that the game will

02:23:12.880 --> 02:23:16.680
actually come out so sorry if you guys were looking forward to that one but

02:23:16.680 --> 02:23:19.440
it's not coming out that makes sense so because I think wasn't it part of the

02:23:19.440 --> 02:23:22.520
summer of arcade or something like that and that doesn't start until like the

02:23:22.520 --> 02:23:26.360
end of July anyways yeah I don't know all right look our phone is ringing off

02:23:26.360 --> 02:23:29.480
the hook let's get let's get some calls done tonight hi you're on orange on

02:23:29.480 --> 02:23:33.360
this radio who's this saying that it calls it almost every single week from

02:23:33.360 --> 02:23:36.200
the East Coast I don't know how you get through every time but I'll tell you

02:23:36.200 --> 02:23:39.640
what I've seen like seven different names pop up in the corners so you're

02:23:39.640 --> 02:23:44.320
lucky tonight what's on your mind that much at first I want to say happy

02:23:44.320 --> 02:23:49.000
anniversary to you guys happy birthday congratulations thank you we're seven so

02:23:49.000 --> 02:23:52.920
we should be having this anniversary show at Chuck E Cheese yes but you're

02:23:52.920 --> 02:23:57.720
still immature as a seven-year-old should be mm-hmm what's on your mind

02:23:57.720 --> 02:24:05.040
tonight buddy I have a question about e3 um before you guys went you have made a

02:24:05.040 --> 02:24:09.640
statement about how you felt III wasn't going to be the same yeah like different

02:24:09.640 --> 02:24:15.800
feelings intake about about before you went did you feel the same way when you

02:24:15.800 --> 02:24:20.520
went or what are you talking about the show itself or what I was kind of

02:24:20.520 --> 02:24:24.280
lamenting about that nobody I knew was really going so it was going to be a

02:24:24.280 --> 02:24:28.160
little weird this year a little bit of column a and a little bit of column B

02:24:28.160 --> 02:24:33.880
the show itself I actually think was better it was better than most of the

02:24:33.880 --> 02:24:38.040
prior years because I felt like I actually got time to play games the

02:24:38.040 --> 02:24:43.160
lines were obscenely long I think whatever they did to kind of and I don't

02:24:43.160 --> 02:24:46.960
know this might be in part because the economy but I think whatever they did to

02:24:46.960 --> 02:24:50.080
kind of filter out some of the people that didn't really need to be there and

02:24:50.080 --> 02:24:53.800
someone might argue maybe I don't need to be there but I would argue right back

02:24:53.800 --> 02:24:58.680
mofo but I would say whatever they did to kind of scale back attendance by you

02:24:58.680 --> 02:25:03.360
know whatever they did from 2006 was a good thing I think the show itself was

02:25:03.360 --> 02:25:07.680
good I do want to see them reopen Kensha Hall at some point get some more

02:25:07.680 --> 02:25:12.880
exhibitors out there on the main floor and again the stuff all that stuff is

02:25:12.880 --> 02:25:16.400
behind closed doors kind of bugs me sometimes but whatever it's just

02:25:16.400 --> 02:25:18.680
something we're gonna have to deal with I think overall the show itself was

02:25:18.680 --> 02:25:23.800
better as far as the whole me lamenting about my friends not going and all that

02:25:23.800 --> 02:25:27.920
stuff I think a lot of that got better I got to go to a pretty bitchin party on

02:25:27.920 --> 02:25:32.840
Wednesday night that was hosted by games for windows for part of their windows

02:25:32.840 --> 02:25:37.480
7 kind of preview thing which was actually pretty cool and I got to see a

02:25:37.480 --> 02:25:40.200
lot of your faces from around the podcasting community and meet a couple

02:25:40.200 --> 02:25:44.640
new ones that was kind of nice I enjoyed stuff like that the show itself was

02:25:44.640 --> 02:25:48.160
really different without kind of having the friends there I kind of feel like

02:25:48.160 --> 02:25:52.760
from a business angle I got more done I didn't collect as much stuff I felt like

02:25:52.760 --> 02:25:56.560
I actually played more games but in again I also kind of contribute that to

02:25:56.560 --> 02:26:01.080
the crowd I don't know I you know it's kind of cool the one day Loki was there

02:26:01.080 --> 02:26:06.720
we got to go around at night at least I had my boyfriend there that I kind of

02:26:06.720 --> 02:26:10.240
got to see at night so it didn't end up being so bad in that regard I think I

02:26:10.240 --> 02:26:13.880
would have had even more fun and I would be like more excited and woo and I would

02:26:13.880 --> 02:26:16.960
have gone all three days keep that in mind is that's a big thing too I didn't

02:26:16.960 --> 02:26:20.560
go all three days this year oh okay I only went two days and I feel like that

02:26:20.560 --> 02:26:24.840
was sufficient I got to see everything I wanted to see I was happy with it and I

02:26:24.840 --> 02:26:27.240
know there's so many people out there that are probably yelling at me right

02:26:27.240 --> 02:26:31.080
right now like you ungrateful bastard I would give my left nut to go to e3 and

02:26:31.080 --> 02:26:34.680
you're just talking to your poo-pooing it down but trust me guys it's it is a

02:26:34.680 --> 02:26:41.780
very exhausting experience it's it's a lot so if you want to go to e3 but you

02:26:41.780 --> 02:26:45.920
can't just go to PAX because and Bobby's made this comparison before and I think

02:26:45.920 --> 02:26:54.040
he's absolutely right PAX is probably what you think e3 is so go to PAX I'll

02:26:54.040 --> 02:26:58.120
be there PAX East Coast PAX that is I want to be at East Coast PAX I'm trying

02:26:58.120 --> 02:27:02.360
but I gotta make West Coast PAX work too and I'll skip West Coast PAX to come to

02:27:02.360 --> 02:27:09.680
East Coast PAX come on I can show you all doing both I just heard that they

02:27:09.680 --> 02:27:13.960
started doing Southwest flights to New York City now did they really yes which

02:27:13.960 --> 02:27:18.320
women are here to party yeah go to Boston Oh boss well yeah yeah you gotta

02:27:18.320 --> 02:27:23.640
go to Boston for PAX East well yeah it's close enough for us yeah well stop by

02:27:23.640 --> 02:27:28.120
four and a half hours Loki you know what another flight connect a jerky when I

02:27:28.120 --> 02:27:32.080
talk to people on the East Coast you know how many times I'm asked so if I

02:27:32.080 --> 02:27:37.640
fly into LA I can drive up and visit you in Sacramento right not very easy well

02:27:37.640 --> 02:27:40.920
I'm just saying you know you can take a cheap flight to New York and then you

02:27:40.920 --> 02:27:47.440
know fly you connect to you know Boston I guess take a train or train there you

02:27:47.440 --> 02:27:51.760
know it's not really all that far to Boston besides I want to fly jet blue to

02:27:51.760 --> 02:27:55.200
New York City I'm sorry if we're given the option between Southwest or jet blue

02:27:55.200 --> 02:28:00.120
jet blue and I've heard lots of amazing things about Virgin Air that's the

02:28:00.120 --> 02:28:03.640
airline I want to try at some point yeah a lot of my friends fly Virginia they

02:28:03.640 --> 02:28:07.280
just love it I've heard great things about it a huge float today too all

02:28:07.280 --> 02:28:10.080
right hey Rama we got to wrap up and let you go but any quick final thoughts

02:28:10.080 --> 02:28:18.360
on that that's it that's it later later s21 under Matt says flying to New York

02:28:18.360 --> 02:28:21.920
and I'll drive you to Boston that's a very nice offer I might be a good way to

02:28:21.920 --> 02:28:25.020
see some of the East Coast too I don't know it's so far off you guys I'll

02:28:25.020 --> 02:28:29.160

02:29:14.160 --> 02:29:18.400
saying you know I want to meet Rob Roberts because that'd be the coolest

02:29:18.400 --> 02:29:21.680
thing ever cuz I've been in him and actually been listening to your show for

go for the cool and it's like wow wouldn't it just be cool to meet Rob

02:29:30.420 --> 02:29:34.000

that would be so cool well that is very flattering thank you very much I would

02:29:37.520 --> 02:29:40.880
love to do it I I don't want to go out there by myself so I'm gonna have to

02:29:40.880 --> 02:29:43.840
convince dark soccer or Loki it's a good idea except that's gonna be tough oh

02:29:43.840 --> 02:29:50.480
yeah well here's the problem Loki's gonna have babies dark soccer has got

02:29:50.480 --> 02:29:55.360
school and all that other stuff other commitments so it's gonna be tough but

02:29:55.360 --> 02:30:02.000

02:30:05.800 --> 02:30:09.840

02:30:21.760 --> 02:30:24.760
everything we talked about in part a this week and you know you only live

02:30:24.760 --> 02:30:28.400
once and all that stuff I want to visit Boston it's a city I wanted to go to I

city on occasion and stuff I really say I have to say it is an amazing city you

02:30:44.000 --> 02:30:49.040
know it's it's no New York but it's got its own charm charms all I need well hey

02:30:49.040 --> 02:30:53.320
did you call in about anything else tonight besides just the pack Tom to be

02:30:53.320 --> 02:30:57.280
honest to be honest I I really I normally wouldn't call in without a

02:30:57.280 --> 02:31:00.480
subject but it was the seventh anniversary and I'm a frequent listener

02:31:00.480 --> 02:31:04.480
so I feel like I'm not trying to like make myself sound cool I just said I

02:31:04.480 --> 02:31:07.680
would want to call and see how I didn't leave a voicemail I don't really have

02:31:07.680 --> 02:31:12.520
much of a topic and I don't really want to get into that deep stuff again I know

02:31:12.520 --> 02:31:16.480
this is more of a gaming podcast but I just want to let you know I really do

02:31:16.480 --> 02:31:21.000
appreciate you going into the current news sometimes because really I listen

02:31:21.000 --> 02:31:25.440
to ORR for the randomness that can pop up along with the mixture of the

02:31:25.440 --> 02:31:28.280
gaming news and that you're not afraid to just have fun sometimes but I just

02:31:28.280 --> 02:31:32.280
want to let you know that well thank you very much and you know certainly this is

02:31:32.280 --> 02:31:35.840

bye later dude one eight seven seven game OLR is the place to call let's try

02:31:53.840 --> 02:31:56.840
going back to the phones hi you're on orange launch radio who's this it's GS

02:31:56.840 --> 02:32:01.240
68 hi what's on your mind buddy I came back from the Philippines I wanted to

02:32:01.240 --> 02:32:05.200
share my arcade side of the things you came back from where I'm sorry the

02:32:05.200 --> 02:32:08.640
Philippines oh the Philippines that's right I think I saw something on your

02:32:08.640 --> 02:32:12.120
Facebook about you were going out there oh yeah believe it or not I actually

02:32:12.120 --> 02:32:15.920
read the status updates on Facebook and Twitter and all that stuff ice how was

02:32:15.920 --> 02:32:21.800
it it was yes all right though like the our case there was good as last time

02:32:21.800 --> 02:32:26.200
maybe that's good as I remembered well you know what it's because the arcades

02:32:26.200 --> 02:32:30.480
over here probably aren't as good as you remember either look that he still have

02:32:30.480 --> 02:32:37.320
some games that I haven't seen on this side of the Pacific Rim years like life

02:32:37.320 --> 02:32:44.360
for example Mario Kart arcade GP with card slots but but really surprised me

02:32:44.360 --> 02:32:51.720
when I was there was house it at that ex hmm how was that basically it's it's just

02:32:51.720 --> 02:32:55.960
bit of a house of death but like they drew it in a cartoony style and you

02:32:55.960 --> 02:33:00.200
probably won't believe I'm about to say but basically the storyline of the game

02:33:00.200 --> 02:33:04.680
it's a zombie romance like that sounds awesome

02:33:04.680 --> 02:33:08.560
zombie romance movie now that's a movie that we need who wouldn't go see that

02:33:08.560 --> 02:33:15.840
about this zombie girl who falls in love with her with her prison guard or

02:33:15.840 --> 02:33:21.480
whatever and they escape and you have to and it's basically a bunch of minigames

02:33:21.480 --> 02:33:26.120
where you have to do things like catch fruit or shoot the bad teeth off of the

02:33:26.120 --> 02:33:30.800
stage one fossil positive or better I thought for a minute there you were

02:33:30.800 --> 02:33:34.240
about to get into lesbian zombie romance because that was the only way this story

02:33:34.240 --> 02:33:36.200
was gonna get even that much better but that's okay

02:33:36.200 --> 02:33:41.480
unfortunately no they can do that in the sequel that's all right it's going

02:33:41.480 --> 02:33:45.880
through perfect and I well as I mentioned it's awesome games that I

02:33:45.880 --> 02:33:52.080
haven't seen in years like f0ax and oh I love f0ax I gotta ask you real quick

02:33:52.080 --> 02:33:54.680
though real quick since we have a lot of time tonight what about music games

02:33:54.680 --> 02:33:57.520
because I know you're big music game fans is there a big presence of games

02:33:57.520 --> 02:34:04.880
the Philippines hello big is there a big presence of music games over in the

02:34:04.880 --> 02:34:14.720
Philippines oh I lost I think we are losing gs68 connection I don't know if

02:34:14.720 --> 02:34:18.880
that's on your end or our end I'm gonna have to let you go I'm sorry I don't

02:34:18.880 --> 02:34:22.200
know what happened with that connection but we'll hope hope maybe he'll call

02:34:22.200 --> 02:34:24.600
back later when the connection is a little better in the meantime let me get

02:34:24.600 --> 02:34:28.160
to another call hi you're on orange launch radio who's this hello hi who's

02:34:28.160 --> 02:34:32.960
this this is leecham six hello leecham six I don't recognize that name are you

02:34:32.960 --> 02:34:37.520
a first-time caller yes I am welcome well welcome what a heck of a night hello

02:34:37.520 --> 02:34:41.440
well what's on your mind buddy yeah yeah I was wondering have you guys I know

02:34:41.440 --> 02:34:46.040
you guys have addressed iPhone gaming and that sort of thing a little bit but

02:34:46.040 --> 02:34:50.480
you know what the new 3.0 update they've you can add new devices to it like

02:34:50.480 --> 02:34:54.760
controllers and stuff mm-hmm have you guys seen that yeah I've seen this one

02:34:54.760 --> 02:34:58.600
it's like a NES controller but it's like a game bone yeah you know we were

02:34:58.600 --> 02:35:01.400
hearing about some of this stuff last week I think there was a story that we

02:35:01.400 --> 02:35:04.280
kind of got into a little bit about like especially about some of the things

02:35:04.280 --> 02:35:07.600
they're gonna be developing for it but I wasn't under the impression that this

02:35:07.600 --> 02:35:11.600
crap was already out you can already get this stuff I don't think so there's one

02:35:11.600 --> 02:35:14.440
in the works though it looks like a SNES controller yeah it's in the works it's

02:35:14.440 --> 02:35:17.360
called the game bone the only thing that sucks about that is it well they had one

02:35:17.360 --> 02:35:20.920
I don't know if you can attach it to the game bone or what but they've got like

02:35:20.920 --> 02:35:25.400
this controller where you can snap it on to the iPhone or iPod touch and then

02:35:25.400 --> 02:35:29.360
they have another one that like you had to have it in like a sort of stand or

02:35:29.360 --> 02:35:32.840
something you have to play it with a controller separately and that seemed

02:35:32.840 --> 02:35:36.640
kind of stupid but the thing about it is they don't really have a standardized

02:35:36.640 --> 02:35:40.000
controller yet so you buy this controller but you have to wait for

02:35:40.000 --> 02:35:45.280
people actually support this controller in their games but I have a question so

02:35:45.280 --> 02:35:49.040
it's a wireless Bluetooth controller right that looks like a NES controller

02:35:49.040 --> 02:35:57.420
doesn't a lot of people already have one it's called a wiimote do that I guess I

02:35:57.420 --> 02:36:00.160
just those do run off bluetooth don't they cuz yes put them up to their

02:36:00.160 --> 02:36:05.240
computers yes so you could in theory use a wiimote or wii classic controller or

02:36:05.240 --> 02:36:10.520
something like that with that if the you know if that's okay with Apple you know

02:36:10.520 --> 02:36:15.560
if they can you know support that or trick right or if they don't need to get

02:36:15.560 --> 02:36:20.080
approved with that if they just support it in yeah whatever game it's coming out

02:36:20.080 --> 02:36:25.040
I would think anything well well here's my question this other thing you're

02:36:25.040 --> 02:36:29.080
talking about that whole device the bone or the game game bone is that an Apple

02:36:29.080 --> 02:36:33.360
official thing or is that now I'm third party come third party interesting so

02:36:33.360 --> 02:36:36.280
that is interesting that that would come out but you would but see Apple so

02:36:36.280 --> 02:36:39.680
locked down with that kind of stuff I'm now here I bet it's just a matter of

02:36:39.680 --> 02:36:43.080
time before someone hacks the phone to read that yeah I'm actually I'm

02:36:43.080 --> 02:36:46.040
surprised that hasn't happened yet I mean the iPhones been out for two or

02:36:46.040 --> 02:36:49.040
three years now and we've had Bluetooth the whole time I'm surprised that hasn't

02:36:49.040 --> 02:36:53.400
happened yet maybe no one sees the point because you know you can't really use a

02:36:53.400 --> 02:36:57.480
Wiimote on the iPhone with such a tiny little screen but I don't see that's

02:36:57.480 --> 02:37:00.400
that's that's the point people are missing I don't want to use motion

02:37:00.400 --> 02:37:03.720
control I just want to use as a nest controller for my nest emulator and that

02:37:03.720 --> 02:37:07.760
makes sense I I'm kind of surprised that hasn't happened I think it's just

02:37:07.760 --> 02:37:10.960
because sometimes those iPhones are like Fort Knox to get into I mean not that

02:37:10.960 --> 02:37:14.880
that's ever gonna stop the hackers right because how many times do they come out

02:37:14.880 --> 02:37:20.480
and say this is unhackable and then today I never act it just seems kind of

02:37:20.480 --> 02:37:24.560
pointless of me to have a nest emulator where my fingers cover the screen when I

02:37:24.560 --> 02:37:29.760
play well now sir you know those the legality of those nest emulators are a

02:37:29.760 --> 02:37:32.800
little questionable the first place so beggars cannot be choosers my friend

02:37:32.800 --> 02:37:35.960
well obviously I'm using games that are ripped from my cartridges that I bought

02:37:35.960 --> 02:37:41.040
when I was seven of course of course yeah you know I'm sure it's a matter of

02:37:41.040 --> 02:37:46.720
time before the Wiimote thing is hacked but you know I don't know if iPhones

02:37:46.720 --> 02:37:51.040
really that big of a gaming platform for me iPhone is where I game when I'm

02:37:51.040 --> 02:37:54.320
sitting in the doctor's office waiting to be called in that it's you know I

02:37:54.320 --> 02:37:57.680
think I think you addressed that last week actually yeah you're not really a

02:37:57.680 --> 02:38:01.980
portable gamer yeah but that maybe that's just me so all right well hey

02:38:01.980 --> 02:38:04.360
thanks so much for the call any other quick things you want to say before we

02:38:04.360 --> 02:38:08.520
let you go not really just love you guys and congratulations on seven years well

02:38:08.520 --> 02:38:11.560
thank you very much and you picked a hell of a call in you take care of color

02:38:11.560 --> 02:38:16.000
sir later guys that was a very nice phone call by the way there was an

02:38:16.000 --> 02:38:20.600
update on a GS 68 he got cut off unfortunately I wanted to ask him about

02:38:20.600 --> 02:38:25.880
SV GL Sunnyvale Golf Land and if they actually did have DJ max there and

02:38:25.880 --> 02:38:29.600
apparently they do have the final version of DJ max is available now at

02:38:29.600 --> 02:38:33.400
Sunnyvale Golf Land because I'm going to be in the okay I think I would guess in

02:38:33.400 --> 02:38:36.920
July yeah so I want to check that out and he did play some games in the

02:38:36.920 --> 02:38:41.200
Philippines that were music oriented as well so let's go to at least one more

02:38:41.200 --> 02:38:45.080
call here and then we'll show in a moment you think that you think the best

02:38:45.080 --> 02:38:49.680
last call to end this in the night off with and who am I talking about you

02:38:49.680 --> 02:38:55.640
hello legend Zaku what's on your pine nothing much just trying to like trying

02:38:55.640 --> 02:39:01.320
to get through all the grief of what was last week and unfortunately earlier

02:39:01.320 --> 02:39:06.280
today but I guess we got to move on to bigger better things basically I'm

02:39:06.280 --> 02:39:11.400
doing this reason I'm calling today is just to bring up the fact that it and

02:39:11.400 --> 02:39:16.520
Bethesda merged which kind of like you know kind of surprised me because I

02:39:16.520 --> 02:39:20.680
never thought that you know then John Carmack would actually sell out to

02:39:20.680 --> 02:39:24.560
something you know to any particular person aside from EA which he's actually

02:39:24.560 --> 02:39:30.440
working with but not to a company like I don't know like Bethesda the folks from

02:39:30.440 --> 02:39:34.760
fallout and I'm not or Elder Scrolls I'm not saying that they're all bad and all

02:39:34.760 --> 02:39:40.880
but I don't know it's kind of like came out of nowhere um yeah I mean yeah we

02:39:40.880 --> 02:39:43.160
didn't really get into it on the show but I guess that was a pretty big deal

02:39:43.160 --> 02:39:47.160
about you know ID and Bethesda kind of having their marriage going on there but

02:39:47.160 --> 02:39:53.600
um I don't know like maybe I'm just not as big of a first-person shooter fan

02:39:53.600 --> 02:39:57.240
that I've been following ID all this time but I know Bethesda makes some very

02:39:57.240 --> 02:40:00.800
pretty games so certainly the two of them coming together it's going to be

02:40:00.800 --> 02:40:04.760
very interesting but you know what when push comes to shove money talks and you

02:40:04.760 --> 02:40:07.800
may have thought that so-and-so was not going to be selling out but you know

02:40:07.800 --> 02:40:11.480
when you got bills to pay and you got right he's buying there's always a you

02:40:11.480 --> 02:40:15.240
know as long as it's still maintain some sort of creative control you know in

02:40:15.240 --> 02:40:20.440
other words if as long as Bethesda's not like pulling their chain to the point of

02:40:20.440 --> 02:40:25.680
like choking them out you know creative wise that would probably make sense as

02:40:25.680 --> 02:40:29.360
long as they mutually respect each other in that level then they could easily be

02:40:29.360 --> 02:40:36.000
you know and everybody wins Bethesda makes pretty decent games though I mean

02:40:36.000 --> 02:40:40.080
like obviously you know oblivion is huge fall out to me Elder Scrolls is pretty

02:40:40.080 --> 02:40:42.760
much with their bread and butter that's what pretty much put them on the map

02:40:42.760 --> 02:40:46.360
right and look but let's not forget Bethesda not every game they put out has

02:40:46.360 --> 02:40:49.680
been a huge success the Star Trek game that they did was not you know it's kind

02:40:49.680 --> 02:40:54.240
of mixed but at least it wasn't terrible you'll mix better than terrible so their

02:40:54.240 --> 02:40:59.640
track records pretty good overall so you know even though it might be something

02:40:59.640 --> 02:41:05.240
you didn't imagine before it's not like it's completely unreasonable that ID

02:41:05.240 --> 02:41:10.600
would go to a fairly respectable company like Bethesda yeah as I said it's all

02:41:10.600 --> 02:41:15.120
about whether or not John Carmack felt like it was something that he should

02:41:15.120 --> 02:41:19.640
have agreed with and you know something that I just hope he has confidence in

02:41:19.640 --> 02:41:24.560
his decision or at least have you know or at least it itself is confident in

02:41:24.560 --> 02:41:31.680
the decision to merge with with Bethesda but aside from that yeah I can't I can't

02:41:31.680 --> 02:41:35.440
actually you know end off the call without making a notable mention of

02:41:35.440 --> 02:41:40.440
Michael Jackson's contribution to video games I mean aside from moonwalker the

02:41:40.440 --> 02:41:47.160
fact that he contributed to Sonic 3 Space Channel 5 I don't know I guess we

02:41:47.160 --> 02:41:52.200
never could never really know of how much success this man has because he's

02:41:52.200 --> 02:41:58.480
pretty much proven himself God knows how many times on all fronts not only on the

02:41:58.480 --> 02:42:05.680
on the stage or on the recording studio but in our consoles well you know

02:42:05.680 --> 02:42:10.800
Michael Jackson certainly was involved with Sega he had a lot of love for Sega

02:42:10.800 --> 02:42:15.200
and I think we would all roll over if they would just put out a moonwalker too

02:42:15.200 --> 02:42:21.360
but sadly it is just not meant to be well I just hope you know hopefully they

02:42:21.360 --> 02:42:24.720
could at least port it to Xbox Live Arcade I know whoever owned well but

02:42:24.720 --> 02:42:28.920
it's gonna be good it's difficult for the fact that God knows who also well

02:42:28.920 --> 02:42:33.000
I said again I say I based on the same thing I said to the emailer who wanted

02:42:33.000 --> 02:42:36.800
the thriller album on rock band don't hold your breath because exactly all

02:42:36.800 --> 02:42:41.040
these rights being up in the air just just don't even the legal mess is only

02:42:41.040 --> 02:42:45.360
is just a tip of the iceberg and I also want to clarify it's not that Michael

02:42:45.360 --> 02:42:50.840
Jackson's moonwalker was really that great of a game well the arcade version

02:42:50.840 --> 02:42:55.400
obviously it was just it was kind of all right it was a frickin video game made

02:42:55.400 --> 02:42:58.960
out of smooth criminal that's what was cool about it but at least he had at

02:42:58.960 --> 02:43:03.440
least he made everybody dance whether it be criminals robots or even like vicious

02:43:03.440 --> 02:43:09.360
guard dogs dance when he did his magic you can't ignore that that you know even

02:43:09.360 --> 02:43:13.480
if you hate music which I don't know anyone that says I hate all music you

02:43:13.480 --> 02:43:17.080
can't ignore the contributions that Michael Jackson made to gaming I would

02:43:17.080 --> 02:43:21.040
buy uh I would buy it again just on the fact that you can make the dogs dance

02:43:21.040 --> 02:43:24.680
we're gonna let you go buddy but thanks so much for the call oh yeah one more

02:43:24.680 --> 02:43:29.040
thing happy anniversary guys well thank you I forgot to mention that but and sit

02:43:29.040 --> 02:43:33.800
in seven more years hopefully we'll see we'll see I don't know I'd be 38 at that

02:43:33.800 --> 02:43:38.560
point all right take care buddy bye we'll always let a call go a little

02:43:38.560 --> 02:43:43.760
extra longer if they're gonna do some butt kissing all right let's see Zaku

02:43:43.760 --> 02:43:47.760
pilot 256 asked Space Channel 5 was a Sega made game on the Dreamcast right

02:43:47.760 --> 02:43:53.240
uh yeah I think Sega published it I think it was yeah because Mizuguchi at

02:43:53.240 --> 02:43:58.280
the time worked for Sega so it was a Sega made game yeah yeah I I say I think

02:43:58.280 --> 02:44:02.800
there's confusion because Mizuguchi now has Q entertainment but he was the

02:44:02.800 --> 02:44:05.920
mastermind behind Space Channel 5 when he worked for Sega but yeah and then of

02:44:05.920 --> 02:44:11.280
course space Michael yeah huge well he had a bigger part in Space Channel 5 too

02:44:11.280 --> 02:44:15.840
there's the whole yeah dance scene that was pretty cool yeah you know good times

02:44:15.840 --> 02:44:19.960
good times all right well um gosh it's about time for us to wrap up and get the

02:44:19.960 --> 02:44:23.480
hell on out of here for the night but before we do that we have to go around

02:44:23.480 --> 02:44:27.760
and get everybody's final thought and I think do we get all last-minute stories

02:44:27.760 --> 02:44:29.520
out of the way I think we covered everything we were gonna cover tonight

02:44:29.520 --> 02:44:32.560
right pretty sure all right then let's go around and get everybody's final

02:44:32.560 --> 02:44:35.840
thought dark Sagra once starts off tonight your final thought the second

02:44:35.840 --> 02:44:40.120
density 3 is a freaking epic RPG they really need to give that an official

02:44:40.120 --> 02:44:44.680
release already just put it on WiiWare for real really my final thought is I

02:44:44.680 --> 02:44:49.360
really need to finish the Rydia after years because the new episodes come out

02:44:49.360 --> 02:44:53.040
like in a week yeah just over a week and I'm not ready for him yet I need to

02:44:53.040 --> 02:44:58.720
finish where I'm at right now so yep Loki your final thought tonight my final

02:44:58.720 --> 02:45:06.680
thought is that I need to play more fuel yes you do I need to kick your butt at

02:45:06.680 --> 02:45:11.840
fuel be fun all right all right actually we see we need to go exploring for Vista

02:45:11.840 --> 02:45:15.160
points although I guess it's not really a cooperative type of game pretty pretty

02:45:15.160 --> 02:45:19.120
tough to play that co-op all right that's it guys we're out of here we are

02:45:19.120 --> 02:45:24.440
gonna close up and as we have said for the past seven years thank you guys for
