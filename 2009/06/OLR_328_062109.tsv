14000	20000	Tonight, June 21, 2009, will you have to pay a premium price for DJ Hero and Band Hero?
20000	23000	Could the BSP be getting its own app store?
23000	27000	And is Activision really going to stop supporting Sony?
27000	31000	Orange Lounge Radio
31000	36000	Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio
36000	43000	We are that show dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle
43000	48000	And it's always the three of us here with you every week to lead you through the week's topics
48000	51000	But of course you guys play an important role in the show too

75000	79000	My name is Rob Roberts, joining us as always, the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers
79000	80000	Yo
80000	81000	How are you doing?
81000	82000	Well, sort of
82000	83000	Well, sort of
83000	85000	Well, yeah
85000	86000	Well, yeah, alright
86000	88000	And playing Sims 3 again, that's two in a row
88000	90000	Well, yeah, but I'm only doing it in the background
90000	91000	No, that's alright
91000	93000	How is Sims life going?
93000	100000	Um, well, for some reason, okay, there's a very small chance of getting knocked up with just plain old woohoo
100000	102000	As in, fucking
102000	104000	And it always seems to happen to mine
104000	107000	Whoopee, like they used to say on the Newlywed Game Show
107000	108000	Rob
108000	109000	What?
109000	110000	It's fucking
110000	112000	Don't you remember the old Newlywed Game Show?
112000	114000	You know, where's the strangest place you've ever had Whoopee?
114000	116000	In the butt, Bob
116000	118000	Alright
118000	120000	Also joining us
120000	123000	And I don't want to know the strangest place he's ever had Whoopee
123000	124000	God
124000	125000	The wife's into porn
125000	127000	Say hello to Techmaster Loki
127000	128000	Hello
128000	129000	How are you doing, Loki?
129000	130000	Doing good
130000	131000	Alright
131000	133000	I don't know what else to ask you
133000	135000	Alright, anyhow
135000	138000	Let's, um, I guess start off the show as we always do
138000	140000	With a little bit of How Was Your Gaming Week?
140000	143000	And of course we'll get into the week's news and your telephone calls throughout the show
143000	145000	And your witty chat comments
145000	147000	From our chat room, chat.orangelandrater.com
147000	150000	But, of course we always start it off with How Was Your Gaming Week?
150000	152000	I probably don't have to ask StarSakura what she's been playing
152000	154000	I can take a pretty good guess, but
154000	155000	Does she want to surprise me?
155000	158000	Well, I played Peggle on iPhone
158000	159000	Okay, that's different
159000	161000	And it was pretty fun
161000	165000	I just played it once and got to the third level, I guess
165000	167000	So it was pretty fun, I love those types of games, though
167000	169000	And, of course, playing Sims 3
169000	171000	Which is pretty cool
171000	173000	Okay, people in the modding community
173000	176000	Hurry up and fix their damn faces
176000	178000	And fix the damn hair
178000	180000	I'll give you a dollar
180000	182000	Start now
182000	184000	Um
184000	186000	And, uh
186000	188000	I played, um
190000	192000	I played Black Knight 2000
192000	193000	The pinball game?
193000	194000	The pinball game
194000	196000	I can hear pinball noises, by the way
196000	198000	We just got to Lord of the Rings
198000	200000	Got rid of Creature from the Black Lagoon, finally
200000	202000	I liked Creature from the Black Lagoon, but whatever
202000	204000	Machine was a bitch
204000	206000	That's right
206000	208000	It seems like it would be a bitch to maintain
208000	210000	Isn't it like the thing where there's a top level and then there's a see-through underneath that?
210000	212000	It's just like a hologram
212000	214000	And you can just change out the hologram
214000	216000	But, um
216000	218000	But really, Dan really wanted Lord of the Rings
218000	220000	So he said he'd get rid of Creature from Lord of the Rings
220000	221000	And the opportunity came up
221000	222000	And he's out there playing it right now
222000	224000	He's been playing it
224000	226000	Practically every piece of dialogue coming out of that game now
226000	228000	Very nice
228000	230000	And, um
230000	232000	I've been playing a lot of
232000	234000	Solitaire
234000	236000	And I downloaded a bunch of games from my new netbook
236000	238000	I put Linux Mint on it
238000	240000	So I've been exploring the gaming in Linux
240000	242000	And, um
242000	244000	Actually, they've got a bunch of
244000	246000	game packages just available
246000	248000	to select
248000	250000	Playing one called Cap Man
250000	252000	Which is Pac Man
252000	254000	And Sudoku
254000	256000	And some of the little stuff
256000	258000	They have a version of Lode Runner
258000	260000	They have all kinds of neat stuff
260000	262000	As soon as I find Kix, I'll be happy
262000	264000	And you've been enjoying your Linux Mint, I know
264000	266000	You've been talking about installing it on one of your computers for months now
266000	268000	I was gonna do it on the old one
268000	270000	But every time it happened
270000	272000	Something would go wrong
272000	274000	The CD had a scratch
274000	276000	Or some crap
276000	278000	And so, um, I finally just said
278000	280000	Fuck it
280000	282000	And, um
282000	284000	Completely got rid of
284000	286000	XP
286000	288000	Because I hated all the crap that Dell put on it
288000	290000	And just like, you know what, I'm gonna
290000	292000	Go completely Linux on it
292000	294000	And I don't regret it at all
294000	296000	I love having multiple desktops
296000	298000	Especially on such a small screen
298000	300000	And it's been pretty cool, I like it
300000	302000	Alright
302000	304000	Alright, well, um, sounds like you've actually been pretty busy
304000	306000	With games that weren't The Sims
306000	308000	I'm actually kind of surprised
308000	310000	But then also plenty of Sims 3, I'm sure
310000	312000	Well, yeah
312000	314000	They're making out right now
314000	316000	They're making out right now? I was gonna ask you to
316000	318000	Update the listeners on what's going on in their Sim world right now
318000	320000	Well, actually, I started over with the same couple
320000	324000	Because I got tired of them having nothing but girls
324000	326000	They seriously had nothing but girls
326000	328000	So, um, I started over
328000	330000	Alright
330000	332000	I started over and I'm, uh
332000	334000	Just hoping for a boy
334000	336000	Well, no, they've got a boy now
336000	338000	Oh, they do now
338000	340000	If they have a girl now, I don't care
340000	342000	Alright, let's move on
342000	344000	Loki, how was your gaming week?
344000	346000	Um, it was alright, didn't play much
346000	348000	I played Grand Theft Auto 4 still
348000	350000	And then I also played
350000	352000	Saints Row 2 when, um, you know
352000	354000	Obviously the live was down on Tuesday
354000	356000	For a brief moment
356000	358000	So, um
358000	360000	Well, actually, all day
360000	362000	But, um, that meant we had to play something that
362000	364000	Would allow us to play System Link
364000	366000	And Saints Row 2 would be that game
366000	368000	And I kicked the crap out of everybody
368000	370000	In Saints Row 2 really bad
370000	372000	Um, I did go back, though
372000	374000	And play some more Saints Row 2
374000	376000	With the actual, um
376000	378000	I guess download expansions that were
378000	380000	Available for it
380000	382000	There's only two real paid expansions
382000	384000	So I had already downloaded both of those
384000	386000	And they're okay
386000	388000	Um
388000	390000	There's one escort mission I have to do
390000	392000	For escorting some
392000	394000	I have to guard these trucks
394000	396000	They're picking up nuclear waste
396000	398000	And, unfortunately, they're really retarded
398000	400000	And they keep, you know
400000	402000	The cops just spawn
402000	404000	Out of nowhere and just crash
404000	406000	Straight into the front of the truck and just
406000	408000	Kind of sit there for a while and
408000	410000	Does constant damage to it, so
410000	412000	I have had to repeat the mission about eight times
412000	414000	And I still haven't passed it yet
414000	416000	And it's really annoying, so
416000	418000	I hate escort missions
418000	420000	All the time, because the AI's really annoying
420000	422000	And then the rest of the missions
422000	424000	Are just kind of what you'd normally expect
424000	426000	In the game, so
426000	428000	Apparently these are the last two, um
428000	430000	Actual things that they're adding on there
430000	432000	So
432000	434000	Oh well
434000	436000	I guess I'm done with Saints Row 2
436000	438000	Um, but then Grand Theft Auto 4
438000	440000	I'm looking to mod it some more
440000	442000	And I've been just waiting to get my computer set up
442000	444000	Which I did today
444000	446000	So hopefully later this week I'll be able to, uh
446000	448000	Tweak it some more
448000	450000	Alright
450000	452000	How's the house going, by the way?
452000	454000	I know we talked a little bit about your new house last week
454000	456000	But now we get settled in a little more, probably
456000	458000	Yeah, still unpacking, got the internet and cable
458000	460000	Hooked up and everything, so
460000	462000	Still unpacking and
462000	464000	Trying to get things cleaned up
464000	466000	My mom and my
466000	468000	Grandparents came over yesterday
468000	470000	They were helping with
470000	472000	Just some of the stuff I needed to get done around the house
472000	474000	You know, patching holes
474000	476000	On the wall and painting
476000	478000	Stuff and that kind of thing
478000	480000	So, yeah, it's just
480000	482000	A constant
482000	484000	Project, I guess
484000	486000	Alright
486000	488000	Well, my gaming week, I feel like I'm back into
488000	490000	A lot of regular gaming now
490000	492000	Especially since I quit pretty much all my MMOs
492000	494000	Believe it or not, I am playing no MMOs at this time
494000	496000	This week was MMO free, 100%
496000	498000	No WoW, no Final Fantasy 11, no nothing
498000	500000	So it's a little weird
500000	502000	Because I've been playing MMOs for so long
502000	504000	But I am completely MMO free this week
504000	506000	And once you know it, this would also be the first time
506000	508000	In a long time that I could report on this program
508000	510000	I actually played a game
510000	512000	Through to completion
512000	514000	I know, shock and awe, because I have this thing
514000	516000	Called Gaming ADD
516000	518000	Where I always jump from one game to another
518000	520000	Spending $60 on one game, never finishing it
520000	522000	And going to another, I'm sure plenty of you are like that
522000	524000	Because a lot of games take a long time to beat
524000	526000	But the game I beat
526000	528000	Was Final Fantasy IV The After Years
528000	530000	Although, I didn't really beat it
530000	532000	I'm kind of getting to stretch
532000	534000	The truth a little bit, because it is an episodic game
534000	536000	You've completed this episode
536000	538000	Yes, I've completed the main episode
538000	540000	The Seador and Cain's Tale
540000	542000	Which was
542000	544000	You know, I talked about this game a little bit
544000	546000	On last week's show
546000	548000	Again, it's total trip down nostalgia lane
548000	550000	I, though, now that I know more about the story
550000	552000	I want to say two things about the story
552000	554000	One, for a real fan of Final Fantasy IV
554000	556000	The story is great
556000	558000	I think it is a great
558000	560000	Written sequel
560000	562000	And that's just basing it off the main episode
562000	564000	But even just reading what I've read about the upcoming episodes
564000	566000	And so on
566000	568000	I think this story is going to be great
568000	570000	And real fan service to fans of the original
570000	572000	But the second thing I want to say about the story is
572000	574000	If you haven't played the original, don't bother with this game
574000	576000	It will not make sense to you
576000	578000	There is so much that references the original
578000	580000	Final Fantasy IV
580000	582000	Or II, if you want to go back to
582000	584000	American numbers
584000	586000	There's so much that references that old story
586000	588000	You will not understand it as much if you didn't play it
588000	590000	Is there a fat Chocobo?
590000	592000	Not that I've run into yet
592000	594000	But apparently they're there
594000	596000	If you want to go out of your way to visit Chocobo forest
596000	598000	In the main story
598000	600000	But the way they have built this game
600000	602000	Since it is episodic content
602000	604000	They have made it a bit more linear
604000	606000	And restricted as to where you can go
606000	608000	But they do it in a way where that doesn't seem obvious
608000	610000	But they definitely restrict
610000	612000	You know how
612000	614000	Even the old Final Fantasy games did this
614000	616000	Think about the very first Final Fantasy game
616000	618000	You were on foot
618000	620000	But then you get a raft
620000	622000	That will take you around in the water
622000	624000	Then you get a ship that will take you around
624000	626000	Anywhere in the water
626000	628000	In deeper water
628000	630000	Then you get the airship that will take you anywhere
630000	632000	And then in Final Fantasy IV you go underground
632000	634000	But the airship can't fly over lava
634000	636000	So then you get the uberaireship that can fly over lava
636000	638000	So you know, they have ways of restricting
638000	640000	Where you can go
640000	642000	And they definitely do that in this game
642000	645720	the original game, you gotta have this game. I know it's taking a lot of crap for the fact
645720	649840	that it is episodic and that they are charging, you know, three dollars every episode means
649840	653480	the game's gonna cost, you know, probably like thirty bucks for all the parts. But you
653480	659000	know what? I try to also value my game on how much time I'm getting out of it and how
659000	664560	much, you know, reward I'm getting from the investment. And honestly, if these three bucks
664560	671740	a pop are going to be three hours, four hours worth a pop of good story and entertainment
671740	677920	for me, then it's worth it. But, you know, this game isn't for everyone. I think a lot
677920	682640	of people would be driven bonkers by the amount of random monster encounters and the fact
682640	686760	that you do have to do a little bit of grinding if you want to get anywhere in the game. I
686760	690400	think that's not for everybody, but I think for fans of the old school Super Nintendo
690400	695880	RPGs, you've got to check this out. It's great. Let's see, other games I've been playing this
695880	699680	week. Speaking of old school role playing games, I was playing Phantasy Star 2 for a
699680	702240	good chunk of time this week, right? Well, here's the thing.
702240	703440	Dude, I have that game.
703440	707600	Okay, you know Trixie360 on Twitter, right? Trixie, she's great.
707600	709440	She just had her baby too. Congratulations.
709440	713200	She did. Congratulations Trixie. You just had baby Trixie this week. She just spawned
713200	714200	this week.
714200	715440	Yes, she has spawned.
715440	720740	But yeah, she was giving away codes and, you know, I just happened to be on Twitter one
720740	725680	night when she was giving them away and I was like, okay, my Google FU skills are awesome.
725680	729160	These little trivia questions she's asking about the 90s, I can do this. I can do this.
729160	732640	I do this for the online games I play all the time that don't relate to video games
732640	737760	with like some of the role play I do. I can Google FU faster than anyone and sure enough,
737760	741440	the second time she gave away a code that I was watching, I won a code for Phantasy
741440	747880	Star 2, which in retrospect seems a little useless because I do have the Sonic Genesis
747880	753320	collection but I, you know, I wanted to see did this game offer anything different and
753320	759320	the answer is not really, except achievements are in it for what it's worth. I haven't gotten
759320	763440	any yet because I, you have to get to level 10 to get the first one. I only played, you
763440	766640	want to talk about a game, an old school game where you have to do a lot of freaking grinding.
766640	770080	Okay, right from the start, you can't really go anywhere until you like grind your way
770080	772120	to level like three or four right at the beginning.
772120	773120	You just set off poor.
773120	776160	Exactly. So, I mean, you want to talk about a game that's really brutal.
776160	779800	But that game has, um, uh, what's-her-face in it, the cat girl.
779800	781200	Yeah, I haven't gotten that far yet.
781200	783040	I've actually, I've actually got a figure of her.
783040	785520	Again, this is Phantasy Star 2 for those folks in chat who are-
785520	787960	The one that turned out evil later.
787960	788960	Well don't spoil, I'm just kidding.
788960	789960	You don't have to spoil, okay.
789960	790960	No, I know.
790960	794980	Phantasy Star 2, if you haven't played it by now, you're probably not gonna.
794980	800200	Not true because I never played it on the Genesis. But granted, there's so many, I could
800200	804240	have gotten it on PlayStation 1 or, you know, any of the millions of times they've re-released
804240	807200	this game. But for whatever reason, I'm just now playing it.
807200	810400	She actually doesn't turn out evil. It's something else weird that happens to her.
810400	811400	Ah, okay.
811400	812400	So, well, it's not really-
812400	814800	I'm sorry, I've barely been paying attention to the story.
814800	817800	But if you want my little figurine, you can have it, because she's cute.
817800	818800	Maybe.
818800	819800	She's a cat girl.
819800	823080	I've been having fun with it so far. I'll have to play a little more. There are leaderboards
823080	826920	too, which is something a little extra you don't have in the Mega Genesis Collection.
826920	831600	And also, the smoothing is in both, but the save system's a little different, but that's
831600	835720	not really anything to hoop and holler about. You can save anywhere in the game though,
835720	839600	and I don't remember, I didn't play it enough in the Mega Collection to know if that was
839600	843360	the case. I think for anybody that owns a collection, there really probably isn't much
843360	847160	point to having this game, unless you really want achievements, or you are just that much
847160	848160	of a fan of the system.
848160	851300	I kind of wonder why they decided to release that collection if they were playing to release
851300	855720	these games. It would seem to me that it would be a good idea to release the games on Xbox
855720	859560	Live Arcade first, suck in all the money that you can, then BOOM!
859560	860920	And really piss us off.
860920	863840	Hey, but who cares? It's a great deal now.
863840	867160	You know what? For those that may not want all those games though, that maybe just want
867160	870000	the role-playing games or what have you, it might be a decent alternative.
870000	873280	No, you probably should still buy the game, because by the time you're actually going
873280	877080	to purchase it, it'll probably be down to $20.
877080	880480	Anyway, Phantasy Star II's alright. If you haven't played it one of the million other
880480	884960	ways you can get that game, then it's worth checking out. It is a piece of gaming history
884960	887800	known for its notoriety of being an incredibly difficult RPG.
887800	894160	God, seriously though. I think it's actually one of the best Sega RPGs out.
894160	897120	And that's why they've released it so many times.
897120	900160	Make sure that people who want it can get it.
900160	904440	Yeah. Okay, let's see. What else have I been playing this week? I've actually been playing
904440	908240	a lot. Fuel is another game I've checked out. This is something that Loki was raving about
908240	912240	on the show a couple weeks ago. I mentioned that I touched the game last week, but I hadn't
912240	916800	really played a lot. I've spent a lot more time with Fuel this week, and you know, I
916800	919800	think honestly you're going to have to file this game and love it or hate it. Because
919800	923560	I've been trying to look at some of the mainstream reviews, which I don't usually do, but I've
923560	928360	been trying to figure out why the game has not been scoring kind of better as a whole.
928360	933040	Because I think there is a lot to this game. I think it's really just a love it or hate
933040	937200	it type of game. There are some pretty in-your-face type of flaws with the game. Like there is
937200	941160	some graphical clipping that is just like, oh my gosh, did I really just drive right
941160	945800	through that tree? Did that really just happen? You know, there are some big flaws. I feel
945800	951520	like this game was slightly rushed. Like if they just spent another couple months doing
951520	955800	some quality testing, the game would be even that much better. But I do love the fact it
955800	960880	is hugely expansive. There is so much world to see. Not that I think there's a lot of
960880	965120	it that's particularly like memorable, but I think what's cool is that they've introduced
965120	972720	these like Vista Points, which you know, there's so much you can collect. You can collect new
972720	977060	images for your car, paint jobs for your car, called liveries, that are hidden throughout
977060	980300	the world. You have to find them and run into them to collect them. And then they have these
980300	984440	things called Vista Points, which are just basically like really pretty spots that you
984440	988160	drive the car to. And they're very specific points and you can collect these as well.
988160	993600	And they also have kind of like cops and robber chase things, where if you run into these
993600	998640	cars then it will reveal the spots of all these challenges or all these liveries on
998640	1003440	your GPS. Or you can actually run into cars and get the car a little later on when you
1003440	1009480	unlock the second area. You can do that. So it's kind of neat. You know, a lot for like
1009480	1014000	somebody who likes to collect things in games. And I love, it's arcade style controls.
1014000	1016680	Did you try driving from the first camp to the second camp?
1016680	1019720	You know I have a funny story about that. Yes I did because I wanted to get that achievement
1019720	1022880	because I looked at what achievements you had got and I figured well anything Loki has
1022880	1027320	I can get. So I actually tried to get that achievement and the funny thing is I didn't
1027320	1032780	finish it because I got fooled. As I was driving there and right when I crossed into that second
1032780	1036900	zone it said, oh, achievement unlocked. And I was like, oh, well I guess I don't really
1036900	1039560	have to drive all the way into the base camp. Well that's cool. That's easy. You just have
1039560	1044040	to drive from the one map line to the other. Whoops. The achievement I found out later
1044040	1048800	that I really got was the one for driving 100 miles cumulatively. I just happened to
1048800	1053080	get it at that moment. And so now I'm going to have to go back and do it again.
1053080	1057280	It's cool though because you drive through a forest fire while you're going there.
1057280	1060800	That's where I actually unlocked it was during, you know, they have done some pretty imaginative
1060800	1063940	things with the game. I just don't think it's for everyone. I think there's a lot of people
1063940	1067560	that are going to pick this up and go, what the hell's the point? Like where, what am
1067560	1074400	I doing? And it does, the game is not kind into kind of a ramp up learning curve. You
1074400	1079280	just are kind of thrown into it. Okay, so what do I do? You're kind of like, do I drive
1079280	1085240	around aimlessly? Do I go into a race? What the F am I supposed to be doing right now?
1085240	1088880	And I think part of the, you know, love it or hate it nature of it is that you just kind
1088880	1092700	of figure out whatever you want to do. You just do. Yeah. So that's kind of part of the
1092700	1097680	interesting thing about it. Uh, it is available on Xbox live. Apparently there's a way that
1097680	1102440	you can go into Xbox live and actually race in the open world with other racers, which
1102440	1105800	kind of reminds me of test drive unlimited. However, when I turned this feature on, I
1105800	1109520	didn't run into a single person, but I thought maybe this was because I was adventuring out
1109520	1113240	in the middle of nowhere in the second world. So mate or second section of the map that
1113240	1116600	you unlock. So maybe everybody's like in the first area, I don't know. Or maybe it was
1116600	1122120	because I was playing it like 1am on Saturday. I don't know, but, uh, I didn't run into anybody,
1122120	1127800	but I did try some of the Xbox live races and uh, yeah. You can make your own races
1127800	1131880	too, which is kind of what I heard. I haven't played with that feature yet. I wanted to
1131880	1136280	do it. I think it'd be fun to film racing from one corner of the map to the other corner
1136280	1141440	of the map because that would take like 10 hours. I've heard it takes a long time to
1141440	1144960	get because we did during lunch one day we said, okay, let's see how far we can get in
1144960	1149440	a half an hour. And it was like hardly anything on the map. We got to a new area and that
1149440	1153480	was it. You actually, you can get further faster if you're smart about the way you do
1153480	1158200	it. If you drive on the freeways with a freeway vehicle, you'll go really fast. But if you
1158200	1162280	try to just go from point A to B off road, like as the crow flies, you're not going to
1162280	1166440	get there as fast. You really do have to take the freeways and the bullet car and go 110
1166440	1171100	miles an hour to get places faster. It's just, you're so tempted. Like I just want to drive
1171100	1175980	off road, you know, and I like that they've scattered the fuel barrel barrels around that
1175980	1179840	you can just kind of run over and get points for it. So I've gotten most of my cars that
1179840	1185560	way. Yeah. Yeah. Nice. So again, I think the game is kind of cool, but it's not for everyone.
1185560	1192800	Like the game definitely has its flaws. Um, the, the single player races, some of it gets
1192800	1197900	a little annoying, like some of the challenges that are just endurance, like it's a 15 minute
1197900	1202440	race. I'm not even joking from one point to another. And then to like come in second on
1202440	1207500	that 15 minute race and get nothing for it is a little frustrating. Like you don't get
1207500	1210520	a silver medal or anything. It's like, Oh, you lose. Do you want to try again? Or the
1210520	1215800	chasing the copter thing and you're just like, Oh, I took the wrong turn. Oh crap. Yeah.
1215800	1220440	There are some areas like that where it's like, come on. I, that is like one big thing
1220440	1224240	I would have fixed is I would have given some type of reward for second and third place
1224240	1230880	or give me a reason to waste 15 minutes, you know? Yeah. So yeah. But otherwise, um, yeah,
1230880	1234320	that game, there's a lot of collectible to it. I will play it again. I got to play the
1234320	1237960	Loki online at some point. That'd be fun. We can have a race to drive from one point
1237960	1242880	to another. It'd be fun. It would be cool. So we'll see. Um, gosh, I've talked a lot
1242880	1247040	about games, but I just, I've had time to play them again. Thanks to, uh, not playing
1247040	1251120	well. So there you go. I guess that's it. I, that's all I'm going to share for my gaming
1251120	1253680	week. I know there's been some other stuff, but that's all I want to share. I want to
1253680	1259520	actually get into some gaming news first, some housekeeping, believe it or not guys,
1259520	1266560	Tuesday, which is, uh, yeah, two days from today, June 23rd marks the seven year anniversary
1266560	1272440	of orange lounge radio. That's right. Our first show was June 23rd, 2002 believe it
1272440	1277480	or not. So on Tuesday it will have been seven years since that very first episode. And that's
1277480	1282320	with essentially no break. And when I say no break, granted, of course we've had a week
1282320	1286920	off here and there for holidays or trips or travel or what have you. But honestly, there's
1286920	1292440	never been a break longer than I think our longest downtime was three weeks once. And
1292440	1295880	that was like a one time thing that happened, but we've been going like nonstop ever since
1295880	1299200	I don't even think it was three weeks. I think it was two weeks when like we were moving
1299200	1303440	out of one, like remember when Loki and I used to live together, we did the show there.
1303440	1307040	I think when we moved from that to the new setup, I think that was our longest break
1307040	1312080	we had because it was such a big move. So, but yeah, seven years of orange launch radio,
1312080	1317360	believe it or not. When we started doing this show, I was just about to have my 24th birthday.
1317360	1322200	I was 23 years old and now I'm going to be, it's funny enough, OLR started three days
1322200	1326560	before my birthday. So now I'm turning 31 this week. That's a long time of doing this
1326560	1331800	show, but yeah, I'm still going. You know what? It's better. Things get the best when
1331800	1336320	you're in your thirties. That's what I say. That's right. So, okay. And we'll be actually
1336320	1339880	having more of a celebration quote unquote next week, although we have nothing special
1339880	1343520	planned. So, um, I don't know when you start to get a certain age, you kind of hope other
1343520	1347560	people throw you a surprise party so you don't have to do any work. No, I'm kidding. I don't,
1347560	1353800	I don't know what there is to do. Uh, so certainly we'll open up the Skype line to your calls
1353800	1358200	about the show. Maybe share some favorite moments. Uh, some of you guys, I would love
1358200	1362200	some of you guys that are archive experts at the show, dig up some of your favorite
1362200	1366000	moments that are out there and available and we'll try to replay some of them next week
1366000	1372200	if we can find any. So there you go. Seven years next week. Um, tiger claw points out
1372200	1376200	and I have, I've been ignoring chat all night. I apologize. Tiger claw points out, uh, today
1376200	1381440	is a holiday. We'll sort of, of course, father's day. So to all of our gaming dads out there
1381440	1386700	today, uh, happy father's day to you or whatever father figure happens to be in your life.
1386700	1390480	Maybe a grandpa or a brother, I don't know. So happy father's day to all of you fatherly
1390480	1395380	figures out there. And as tiger class doesn't chat today as a holiday, we'll sort of happy
1395380	1400740	about to be a father's day for Loki. This is, you know, the wife is preggers. Well,
1400740	1405280	they celebrated it for me anyway. They got a shop vac, which is awesome. Oh, nice power
1405280	1411360	tools. I need the shop vac like any good father should have. So there you go. All right, well,
1411360	1414960	um, let's get into the show tonight. And for those that listened last week, which I hope
1414960	1419640	you all did, it was on the podcast feed. Our podcast feeds been on time lately. Um, we
1419640	1424360	have kind of changed the format of our show a little bit less stories, more time with
1424360	1428600	each story, because, you know, you guys can go on and, you know, kind of get a rundown
1428600	1432200	of the gaming news on hundreds of different websites, but this is one of the only places
1432200	1436640	where you can really talk about them with other gamers who aren't jerks and leave comments
1436640	1442280	that say first. So let's talk about this week, gaming news. There's been some big stories
1442280	1446760	this week, especially huge one. Uh, dark soccer is going to start us off tonight with some
1446760	1450120	game, uh, with some gaming news to talk about and your calls at eight seven, seven game
1450120	1456400	OLR. Well, we have a case of, it could be a business decision or it could just be, um,
1456400	1461900	a case of pissy bitchiness. I don't know. Activision's got some PMS going on, but they
1461900	1468560	just say there might stop supporting Sony. Um, the saying that, um, actually their CEO,
1468560	1475400	Bobby Kotick said that they would have to cut the price, um, because, uh, they wouldn't
1475400	1481160	be able to, I guess, make the games, you know, that people would buy because the console's
1481160	1486720	too expensive. You know, also, I think there's a certain amount of, uh, costs that goes into
1486720	1492000	doing anything for Sony because they've got some pretty expensive rates. Um, they said
1492000	1498800	that they might just have to stop, um, supporting Sony come 2010, 2011. Um, and they're also
1498800	1505760	considering not just the PS3, but the PSP as well. Um, they pay 500 million in royalties
1505760	1515080	to Sony, um, which is roughly about 40% of their profit. Um, so under those circumstances,
1515080	1519520	you know, I kind of don't blame them. You know, if they're trying to really make back
1519520	1525160	their money, their Xbox, honestly, Xbox and Wii is going to be where it's at for Activision,
1525160	1531720	I would think. Uh, Loki, you agree? I don't, I don't happen. I don't know. Well, I don't
1531720	1536480	know if I totally agree with the whole, it's only there on Xbox and Wii, but I, I get it.
1536480	1541000	I get that sentiment, but I do think you have your hardcore Sony audience that would justify
1541000	1545720	the cost of porting the game. Bobby Kotick has been bitching about the Sony PS3 price
1545720	1550920	for a long time now. Every time you hear about some, you know, Activision's bitching about
1550920	1554800	the price of the PS3, they think it's too high. They think there should be a price drop.
1554800	1559000	They're hoping there's a price drop. They're always complaining about the PS3 price, and
1559000	1563320	you know what? They still sell, they don't sell as many units on the PS3 as they do on
1563320	1568160	the 360, but they still sell quite a bit. And I'm sorry, but you're going to just cost
1568160	1573960	average everything across the board, you know, for most of the games that you develop. So,
1573960	1578080	you know, hey, if you don't want to develop for the PS3, then don't. But I think, you
1578080	1584280	know, franchises like, you know, Modern Warfare 2 and, you know, Guitar Hero and stuff, the
1584280	1590560	PS3 is still a very integral part of, you know, those franchises. And to just get rid
1590560	1596440	of it because, oh, it's too expensive, well, that's not really good reason. Although, let's
1596440	1601320	just say if they are crazy enough and they actually go through with it, that's going
1601320	1605680	to suck for Sony. And that's going to be something I don't know if they can be able to make up
1605680	1613680	ground on. Empty threats? Probably. What do you guys think? 1877 Game OLR or a username
1613680	1619080	on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio and I'm reading the chat room here. Rama says, good for Activision.
1619080	1626640	Now from what I heard or remember reading, EA, I guess, I don't know if maybe EA dropped
1626640	1633240	or Sega, they weren't supporting the Genesis or something like that at one time. Like EA
1633240	1639560	dropped them for similar reasons. I don't know, it'd be interesting. I don't think that's
1639560	1644400	going to happen though. Because, I mean, all it would take is something like that to happen.
1644400	1654400	Say Activision to stop publishing Guitar Hero on the PS3 and boom! Rock Band will come in,
1654400	1659680	swoop up all those sales right there. And then, you know, Modern Warfare 2, I'm sure
1659680	1665040	there's going to be another military shooter out there. If not first party, then someone
1665040	1672320	else putting something out. I don't know, it's not going to just kill them for not having
1672320	1675760	Activision. There's a couple listeners in chat that want to say it's the Dreamcast that
1675760	1681760	EA dropped. Oh, Dreamcast, okay. Okay, that's what it was. I knew it was the Sega system
1681760	1687040	but I couldn't remember which one. So yeah, I mean, I doubt that at this point they're
1687040	1692400	going to do that. There is a response from Sony. Obviously this thing caught so much
1692400	1696880	momentum around the internet that Sony had to make a response and they did. And the response
1696880	1700880	goes something like this. PlayStation has tremendous momentum coming out of E3 and we
1700880	1705200	are seeing positive growth with more than 350 titles slated to hit across all of our
1705200	1709680	platforms including many anticipated games from our publishing partners. And this, by
1709680	1714360	the way, this quote is from Patrick Siebold who is a spokesperson for PlayStation. We
1714360	1718480	enjoy healthy business relationships with and greatly value our publishing partners
1718480	1722560	and we are working closely with them to deliver the best entertainment experience. So in other
1722560	1726800	words, they didn't really address the issue. They just kind of said, we still are awesome
1726800	1732400	and we're just going to ignore this guy because he's a boob. Well, he may be a boob. I mean,
1732400	1741400	who knows? He seems to whine a lot, I guess. It really doesn't matter if he thinks there
1741400	1744680	should be a price drop. They shouldn't have to drop their price because he thinks there
1744680	1750560	should be a price drop. Fuck him! He doesn't work for Sony. So, you know, whatever. I mean,
1750560	1754560	they don't have to... I think it's going to be a bad business decision for them to drop
1754560	1759160	the Sony platforms because, you know, that's millions of people that aren't going to be
1759160	1765240	buying your product. And when, you know, a lot of games nowadays rely on both consoles.
1765240	1769800	I mean, I know with like Grand Theft Auto even, you know, it wasn't exactly 50-50 for
1769800	1775680	the console sales, but it wasn't too skewed one side or the other. I mean, that is a good
1775680	1781680	portion of their sales. And I can imagine the same thing for, you know, Call of Duty
1781680	1785960	and Guitar Hero and stuff like that. The PS3 sales have got to be a pretty significant
1785960	1791120	part now. If their development costs are too high or licensing costs are too high across
1791120	1795600	the board, then maybe that is something that Sony can go and fix. And I know that they
1795600	1799880	have, as far as the PSP, they've kind of lowered the development cost for that as far as the
1799880	1803440	debug units and that kind of thing. And I think that they're working on something similar
1803440	1807700	to that with the PS3 as well. Maybe that might be something that they can look at as an option
1807700	1812700	to, you know, save some money for the third-party publishers and give them a reason to develop
1812700	1816840	more on the PS3. But, you know, it's not a reason to drop them. Here's a comment from
1816840	1820160	Rama I find interesting in our chat room. chat.orensonshreda.com. And again, we are
1820160	1825240	just, you know, inviting phone calls throughout the show. 1-877-GAME-OLR. Rama in chat says,
1825240	1829440	it takes one company to stand up to Sony. If Activision drops support for PlayStation
1829440	1834220	3, it's just a matter of time that other companies do as well. I don't know though, because didn't
1834220	1839120	a few companies leave ESA, but not everybody did? You know, like, I don't think necessarily
1839120	1844200	one in Activision was kind of, you know, that's one reason I almost would believe this guy
1844200	1850280	if he's a boob or not is that Activision did drop ESA for a while, didn't they? At least,
1850280	1854080	yeah. And Blizzard didn't even freaking go to E3 this year because they're like, we don't
1854080	1858560	need to, basically. We got BlizzCon. We sell out those tickets, like, you know, we have
1858560	1863560	to set up freaking queues on our website to handle the load and they're gone in 15 minutes.
1863560	1870120	We don't need it. Like, so, you know, on one hand, despite the thought that, again, I'm
1870120	1873860	kind of torn. I'm like, yeah, it sounds like an empty threat, but at the same time, track
1873860	1877400	record shows Activision is willing to make good on these type of threats. You know what
1877400	1882560	I mean? Well, he says you can have like a time frame. Oh, 2010, 2011. If it was like,
1882560	1887920	if you do not drop your price by December 31st, 2009, we will be gone June, you know,
1887920	1892080	first 2010. That's like a closed door conversation, though. You know what I mean? Yeah. Part of
1892080	1897160	me wonders, though, is this much ado about nothing? Did this guy make an offhanded remark
1897160	1903320	that just, you know, a sound bite, if you will, did this guy just make a careless remark
1903320	1909120	that got picked up and ran with by the gaming press and overanalyzed by folks like ourselves?
1909120	1916880	I kind of don't think so. Well, who? Kodak? He made it to the, to the Times. I guess that's
1916880	1922360	true. And I think he was pretty clear on it, but the fact is, I mean, how many times have
1922360	1927680	we been reporting on, you know, company heads making stupid comments about something and,
1927680	1933720	you know, and the fallout from it? I mean, Sony is a perfect example of that, you know,
1933720	1942680	and thank goodness they got rid of the cran eating guy, but, yeah, it's, I don't know.
1942680	1946320	I don't think anything's really going to happen with this, and that's really kind of the issue.
1946320	1950000	And yes, I think that they should drop the price of their system, but for entirely different
1950000	1955160	reasons other than Activision says so. I mean, that's not the reason to drop the price of
1955160	1958160	the system. There's some good debate going on in our chat room right now. Maybe that's
1958160	1962560	why everybody's afraid to call in, which is fine. And also, I think we had a slight listener
1962560	1967400	dip tonight. I don't know if everybody's aware, but we shifted a little bit on the radio stream.
1967400	1971760	It is not right now on the front page of allgames.com. I guess they're doing some remodeling over
1971760	1977240	there. I don't know. But we're on radio.allgames.com, and I think a few of folks may have not figured
1977240	1980840	that out even though there's a big link at the top that says All Games Radio on allgames.com.
1980840	1985560	I don't know. But, yeah, so, but we do have some chatters that are very active tonight,
1985560	1989720	and Tigerclaw in chat says, the sad part about this, there are people out there who are willing
1989720	1995000	to pay the premium to get a PlayStation 3. But Rama retorts with this, PS3 is not a premium
1995000	1999760	console, neither is Xbox 360 or Wii. Sony won't price drop because they'll take a higher
1999760	2004400	loss on each unit. Don't forget, Rob, Best Buy, GameStop, and other companies told Sony
2004400	2008200	to drop the price of the PSP, or else they'd stop selling it.
2008200	2012960	Hmm. That is a problem when the companies that are selling your product are saying they're
2012960	2017000	going to drop you. I think more so than the publisher, because, to be honest, they could
2017000	2022280	probably make it through without Activision, even though Activision right now is the number
2022280	2031920	one publisher out there, only because EA dropped the number two. But, I don't know, it's not
2031920	2034400	going to kill them if they go away.
2034400	2038580	Let me read this comment as well from Bochikawa in our chatroom. It's a total bluff, but it
2038580	2042880	still puts into people's mindset to stop dealing with Sony, and even then, I doubt they will
2042880	2047080	stop dealing altogether, leaving ports or minor titles to them.
2047080	2051000	Because think about it. Here's another thing. Think about it. Would you really want to ruin
2051000	2056760	your relationship with Sony? Say, okay, we're going to stop supporting the PlayStation 3
2056760	2061280	and the PSP. Okay, the PlayStation 4 comes out. Oh, you just burned your bridges with
2061280	2067680	Sony because you're being a dick, and now you have the PS4 coming out, and you could
2067680	2070920	have had some really good partnerships with them to get some good launch titles and that
2070920	2077040	sort of thing. Oh, but you're a dick, so now they're going to, I don't know, maybe be so
2077040	2083840	kind to you because you decided to drop them dead weight, and maybe possibly hurting the
2083840	2085600	launch of your next system.
2085600	2090080	You know, I don't know how I feel about the whole PlayStation 3 is not a premium console
2090080	2094640	content. I don't know if I'd necessarily call it premium, but let's face it. The PlayStation
2094640	2099840	3 does have one big component you cannot ignore that the Xbox 360 and the Wii doesn't have,
2099840	2104360	and that's Blu-ray. You know, especially as we're getting into more high definition, and
2104360	2108320	Blu-rays are starting to penetrate the market more and more. We're kind of where DVDs were,
2108320	2111760	what, 12 years ago. You know, as Blu-rays are starting to penetrate the marketplace
2111760	2115400	more and more. I don't think you can ignore the fact that the PlayStation 3 is the only
2115400	2119600	one out there right now that's a Blu-ray player, and that's not something that I don't, despite
2119600	2124640	all the rumors, Microsoft ain't even considering, and Nintendo sure as hell ain't considering
2124640	2126680	this whole Blu-ray thing.
2126680	2131840	So that's one thing that Sony's always going to have, making it, you know, a type of entertainment
2131840	2136360	hub. Now, to be fair, of course Xbox has the whole Netflix thing, which has worked out
2136360	2141560	very well for them. It's a completely alternative method of delivering movies that we might
2141560	2146360	see getting bigger and bigger, and perhaps one day giving Blu-ray a run for its money.
2146360	2153440	But in a lot of respects, I don't think it's there yet for the average consumer.
2153440	2158840	Yeah, and for the average consumer, the PS3 is an awesome Blu-ray player. It does all
2158840	2163600	the updating for them. They don't need to worry about, oh, will this disc play in my
2163600	2168120	system? Because, you know, a lot of people out there that don't own a PS3 and just have
2168120	2171440	a normal Blu-ray player, you need to have that thing connected to the internet, and
2171440	2176920	to update your system, you know, to the updated firmware so that it can play, you know, whatever,
2176920	2183760	you know, Blu-ray movie is out there, you know, there's a lot of burning off discs and
2183760	2187960	different processes along with that, whereas the PS3 makes it very seamless with their
2187960	2194380	firmware updates. So, you know, that is something we kind of don't, we kind of take for granted,
2194380	2198200	but you know, it is a big thing, especially when you're looking at movies and you're thinking
2198200	2202240	about getting into, you know, the Blu-ray market, and at the time, it was the cheapest
2202240	2206960	Blu-ray player out there. Now, not so much anymore, but I got to think, you know, now
2206960	2212240	that Blu-ray's been out there for at least a few years now, the price of the components
2212240	2217280	have to have come down by now, and you know, they've got to find ways to cut costs, and
2217280	2221520	you know, maybe putting out new systems with larger hard drives isn't the way to go. Maybe
2221520	2225880	you should just, I don't know, keep the same hard drive size and start dropping the price,
2225880	2232880	or drop something else, I don't know, make it cheaper. Yeah, let's see, a couple more
2232880	2237760	comments from chat. Rama says, Loki, that's reminiscent of the whole Nintendo Square debacle
2237760	2245600	years ago. Yeah, and Square's back. That's true, but you know, Nintendo did take a pretty
2245600	2253120	big hit. You know, Final Fantasy, going over to the PlayStation, was huge. It was just
2253120	2259440	absolutely huge. In some ways, maybe I'm just a little biased here because I happen to be
2259440	2265280	a role-playing game fans, I think Nintendo 64 didn't do so hot, in part, because of that.
2265280	2270280	Not really, but they did get Pokemon. I mean, it was the Nintendo franchise, but seriously,
2270280	2275160	the Pokemon franchise. Oh, your sound is off. Is your mic on? No, it slid, sorry. Well,
2275160	2279960	I was going to say, Nintendo did have, you know, Pokemon to keep them above, above water
2279960	2287480	pretty much. I think that's what saved the Nintendo 64 as long as it did. Let's see,
2287480	2293760	two Africans in our chat room says, simply, PlayStation 3 is a great system. On what planet?
2293760	2297640	I don't know, I think it is a good system. It is a good system. It's a good Blu-ray player.
2297640	2302440	Well, yeah, it's a good Blu-ray player. It's much quieter than the Xbox 360. I enjoy playing
2302440	2308760	games on it. It's got the better controller than the 360. I disagree. I don't fault the
2308760	2313160	PS3 as a bad system at all. I don't think it is a bad system. I think they just marketed
2313160	2318600	it terribly. It was too expensive to begin with. If I hadn't gotten mine for free, you
2318600	2324080	know, from a wonderful customer of mine, I probably wouldn't own one. Or at least not,
2324080	2328280	it would have taken a long time before I owned one, because, you know, $400 for a system
2328280	2332440	even now, I mean, it's a lot of money to drop on that. Let me go to the phones. We just
2332440	2337240	got a call. Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this? Hi, yeah, this is Spazinator.
2337240	2342000	Hi, Spazinator. What's on your mind about this whole PlayStation 3 debacle going on
2342000	2347680	in Activision? Do you think they're going to make good on the threat? No, not at all.
2347680	2353680	Well, there's a slight possibility, but the possibility of it is kind of, you know, somewhat
2353680	2360360	like, you know, there's always a possibility that, you know, it could snow in, you know,
2360360	2367000	southern Mexico, but it's very likely that it happens. Not likely, but you never know.
2367000	2374640	Well, yeah, but I don't know if that's totally the same thing going on, but what about, like,
2374640	2378720	I could ask the question, do you think Sony needs to drop the price of the console, but
2378720	2382960	who's not going to say yes to that? But the question I'm going to ask is, do you think
2382960	2390640	Sony has real, legitimate reason to drop the price of their console right now? Yes, you
2390640	2397120	know, depends on how you want to look at it. I'm kind of on the fence on that subject.
2397120	2403560	I can see why they're not tracking it, because, you know, mainly because of the Blu-ray drive
2403560	2408560	itself, they're still kind of expensive to manufacture, and they're already taking a
2408560	2416760	hit by, you know, selling at the price they're at, but at the same time, you know, at least
2416760	2424200	for most consoles, I think, except for, like, the Wii and the PlayStation 2, generally speaking,
2424200	2430000	console manufacturers always take a hit on, you know, consoles, and it's kind of like
2430000	2437440	a stop-loss kind of thing, where they tend to make all their monies through the licensing
2437440	2443600	fees on the games, right? I guess. I'm looking at a lot of chat comments, though, about the
2443600	2447840	whole thing, and GameGuru says, I'd own a PlayStation 3 if it were $300 and was backwards
2447840	2453000	compatible with PS2 games. That's a huge thing. That was so stupid of them to eliminate that
2453000	2456720	as quick as they did. I guess they did it as a price-cutting thing, but they needed
2456720	2461040	to find a way to do it somehow, I think, and Two Africans said the PlayStation 3 would
2461040	2465120	have been more successful if Sony hadn't raped us in the ass with the price at launch. They
2465120	2469540	don't get how to do it, and basically, even from launch, remember when we saw, when they
2469540	2472280	were first talking about the PS3 and they were showing off the controller and stuff
2472280	2477640	like that, and it's $600, and you were like, what? Are you stupid? Let me wrap up with
2477640	2482560	Spaznator, though. Spaznator, do you think this is actually going to happen? Do you think
2482560	2485360	Activision is actually going to pull out, or what?
2485360	2494560	Probably not. I hope not. At least for the sake of those, they only own the PlayStation
2494560	2499560	3. Otherwise, they're going to have to go shell out for a second console, whether it
2499560	2505520	be Wii or 360. All right. Well, thank you very much, Spaznator, for your thoughts. Thank
2505520	2512720	you so much for the call. Take care. I was going to say about, there's certain things,
2512720	2516440	though, that we're kind of forgetting, too, is that PlayStation, you know, because I can't
2516440	2519880	remember Spaznator is the one that plays Final Fantasy XI. It was him or one of the other
2519880	2523600	listeners that plays Final Fantasy XI a lot. It made me think that Final Fantasy XIV is
2523600	2527840	on its way to PlayStation 3. God, I know. And there are some exclusives out there on
2527840	2530240	the horizon, but is it going to be...
2530240	2534800	It's always, okay, here's the thing with Sony, and it's been this way ever since the launch
2534800	2539800	of the PS3, and even the PSP. There's always been exclusives, and they've always been on
2539800	2544320	the horizon, and they've always stayed on the horizon, until finally they decide, hey,
2544320	2548840	okay, we're going to finally come out with this now. But price has always been an issue
2548840	2553580	with the Sony platforms. Ever since the PS3 launched, the price has been too high. I don't
2553580	2557640	care what kind of price drops they've been doing, it's still too damn high for it right
2557640	2564340	now. And even with like the PSP, the PSP Go price, are they fucking crazy? Let's put it
2564340	2568680	out for $250. Great, that's a perfect way not to sell any more consoles. That PSP Go
2568680	2575680	is going to fail like crazy. But I don't know, I think it's just, they're really, they need
2576080	2580440	to get smart, and they need to figure out a way to gain ground now, and yes, the exclusives
2580440	2583240	will help, but price drop will help even more.
2583240	2589400	If the PSP Go, I think, had a $99 price point on it like Dan had mentioned a while back,
2589400	2592000	then I think they'd be selling like freaking hotcakes.
2592000	2592900	I agree.
2592900	2599900	And on top of that, looking at the construction of them about what they took out, the machines
2599920	2606280	themselves can't really be relatively that expensive to produce, nor can shipping and
2606280	2611120	marketing costs really be that much if they've already got some momentum going with it. So
2611120	2618120	really, you know, say that to cost ship and market each individual system, it costs them
2619800	2625800	say $80, put it out for $125, you'll make tons of profit still, because you'll get more
2625800	2630080	units out, and the more you mass produce them, the cheaper they are to produce.
2630080	2633440	Okay, we've got to move on with some more stories, and we will, but I want to say-
2633440	2638820	I was saying, my point is, is that that's simple economics, simple business, and Sony
2638820	2644860	should know that. If they want to get, you know, the games, if they want to keep some
2644860	2648960	of their people, if they want to sell the systems, that's the way to do it.
2648960	2654400	I think one place that Sony is losing to Microsoft, as much as I do enjoy my PlayStation 3, is
2654400	2659160	that they are not staying current as fast as Microsoft does, and that is killing them
2659160	2663800	this generation. Because Microsoft had a hard time doing that with the original Xbox, but
2663800	2669040	right now, they built that 360 to get these upgrades and all these things fast. And you
2669040	2673800	know, one thing that Microsoft's doing right right now, that I would say not even Nintendo's
2673800	2677560	doing, but Nintendo doesn't need it because their audience is totally different right
2677560	2683240	now, is that they are evolving so much faster. You know, with this whole thing like the NXC,
2683240	2687160	Netflix on the 360, some of these other things that are coming out, you know, they are able
2687160	2691840	to, with what they've got, the constraints they have with that machine, they're making
2691840	2696480	it work a lot faster than Sony is. When was the last time you saw a major, major, major
2696480	2703200	upgrade to the PlayStation outside of home? And some would argue home, you know, was not
2703200	2704960	all it was cracked up to be. So I don't know.
2704960	2708740	It's definitely not the big hub that they thought it would be. It's kind of a neat thing
2708740	2710640	to play around with, but yeah.
2710640	2715540	All right. Well, I'm sure this story is to be continued. It'll be interesting to see
2715540	2719240	how long this whole little stalemate lasts.
2719240	2726240	Yeah. Well, speaking of PlayStation, the PSP Go has an interesting rumor kind of related
2727640	2733600	to it. Apparently there's a rumor that Sony is working on an app store for the PSP Go,
2733600	2740600	and that's going to be revealed at Gamescom in Cologne this August. And they're basically
2741720	2748120	saying that these games will be limited to like 100 megs, and basically the only limit
2748120	2753720	for con- or that's only the limit for the content, but any apps that they want to create
2753720	2760160	including non-game applications may also be available as well. So, you know, some of these
2760160	2765600	smaller programs at cheaper prices or maybe, you know, free, kind of aligning themselves
2765600	2770640	with, you know, what Apple has with their app store. It'd be interesting if this is
2770640	2775680	going to be the draw for the PSP Go.
2775680	2781920	It makes sense to me that they're going to do something like this, because really, this
2781920	2787280	has to be the only thing that they've got in the cards for, because what would be the
2787280	2793100	draw to the PSP Go if basically all the games are just digital downloads now and the system
2793100	2797760	is more expensive? You need something unique to it to draw people to pay that extra, you
2797760	2798800	know, $100.
2798800	2804360	I kind of thought this already existed. Like, not so much a storefront on the PSP, but I
2804360	2809680	thought, like, your PS3 store was supposed to interact with the PSP as well as you could
2809680	2811520	get something like this on your PC.
2811520	2818520	Well, it's not necessarily, um, not necessarily like the store that's on the PSP because that
2818520	2823880	is already available right now. It's more of like the app store where you can get applications.
2823880	2829300	I can buy a calculator if I wanted for this. I can buy an app to, you know, browse restaurants
2829300	2834720	or some, you know, crap like that. This is what they're talking about. Not necessarily,
2834720	2836600	more like, think the iPhone, you know.
2836600	2837800	Well, it's not an iPhone store.
2837800	2838800	Yeah, basically.
2838800	2840520	Are they going to sell music and movies on it too?
2840520	2844000	Well, they already do it on the PlayStation Network, so.
2844000	2849200	I guess that's true. You can get it on your PSP, but I bet you they ain't doing half the
2849200	2850600	business Apple is.
2850600	2855240	Nope. Not for $250 when you can buy an iPhone. You know, granted, you have to lock into a
2855240	2857440	contract, but for $99.
2857440	2861440	Most people don't give a crap. I'll tell you what. Go to the average consumer. A lot of
2861440	2865040	people do not give a crap about that contract in order to get that new hot little iPhone
2865040	2869760	device. There's tons of people that are shelling out the $99 right now to do it. I have friends
2869760	2873000	that have been upgrading and they're like, ah, whatever contract. I have a cell phone
2873000	2877920	contract with my company right now. You know, or whatever. It's kind of an inevitable part
2877920	2881240	about doing business with a phone company in this day and age, which is too bad in some
2881240	2882960	ways, but.
2882960	2886600	I'm probably not going to do my upgrade though for some time.
2886600	2892000	No, I mean, I, I'm already an iPhone user. The 3GS does not seem to have enough. Would
2892000	2895760	it just, especially with, I would have to pay extra money cause I'm not eligible for
2895760	2899560	upgrade yet, which is AT&T's problem, but.
2899560	2904200	Actually no, they're, they're, um, they took away that thing where.
2904200	2906760	Yeah, you still have to be in a certain window though that I'm not in.
2906760	2913640	Oh, well I, but I've got an old iPhone. So for me, it's, it makes perfect sense to upgrade
2913640	2917400	it. Although I'm not going to do it until, you know, a cup, about a month from now, but
2917400	2918400	still.
2918400	2919400	Well then.
2919400	2920400	Wait for them to work all the bugs out of it.
2920400	2923960	Yeah. If you're still on the very, very old one, I can see why, but I'm on a 3G and there's
2923960	2927960	just not enough about 3GS that really, yeah, battery life. Yes.
2927960	2932280	I'm down for the faster processor myself and having a better camera on it.
2932280	2940160	Hmm. Well, um, let's see. Uh, yeah, I, I don't know about this whole PSP store thing. I guess
2940160	2944440	it's a good idea, but I kind of think it's like kind of in a way it's too late, but I
2944440	2947920	guess there's a lot of people that don't have nor want the iPhone. And again, I have to
2947920	2954040	think about that college kid audience that seems to be the PSP and target audience that,
2954040	2955040	that really has these things.
2955040	2959560	Here's the other thing too, the college kid audience. If you really want to, you can mod
2959560	2964120	your PSP and there's the homebrew community that's already done this and has been doing
2964120	2968760	this for years now. So why bother paying for something that you can get for free and it
2968760	2974200	will probably end up being better anyways. And seriously, you know, if the PSP Go does
2974200	2979200	take off, then those PSP 2000s and 3000s are going to be even cheaper. You know, how am
2979200	2984640	I supposed to do the 2000 because the screen isn't that great on the PSP 3000. And there
2984640	2985640	you go.
2985640	2989240	I still have the very, very first PSP and like no memory card, but you know what else?
2989240	2993440	I haven't touched it in a long time. I think the last game I really played on it was that
2993440	2996640	Final Fantasy II remake they did. Well, maybe Space Invaders Extreme.
2996640	3000080	What about Dissidia? Would you play that?
3000080	3004000	Honestly at this point, probably not, but that's because I'm not a fan of handheld gaming
3004000	3007920	in the first place. And I've gone into this rant on a previous show and I realized this
3007920	3012520	is a personal preference that makes me weird than a lot of other gamers. I do not like
3012520	3017520	playing portable games. The only place I can play a portable game is like at the airport,
3017520	3022200	on an airplane, when I'm on a trip and don't have my consoles with me and I have to play
3022200	3026840	something. But if I'm at home, I would not be caught dead with the DS in my own home
3026840	3031120	playing in my house when I have a PlayStation and all this other stuff readily available
3031120	3032120	to play.
3032120	3036080	Well, if I want to play a particular game, if I've got the system for it, I'll just play
3036080	3040600	it on whatever system it's on. If I want to play Cooking Mama, I'll play the good version
3040600	3043520	on the DS, which I've been known to do.
3043520	3049440	But the game, for me to go that far, there's so many games out there, it's kind of like,
3049440	3052440	there's lots of games I want to play, and I'll just play the ones I want to play on
3052440	3058120	the console while I'm at home. And again, I know I'm weird, but a game on the handhelds
3058120	3064320	has to be really good and really anticipated for me to play them when I'm in a house.
3064320	3067320	Scribble nuts!
3067320	3070480	I'll probably end up picking it up for when I do travel, but I don't see myself sitting
3070480	3074960	in my bed playing it. I'm just, I know I'm weird like that. I don't know. I can't explain
3074960	3075960	it.
3075960	3077280	Do you play games on your iPhone?
3077280	3083000	Um, when I'm out and about, like if I'm at the doctor's office waiting for an appointment.
3083000	3084400	But not at home?
3084400	3089140	The only time I have is like, when I'm lying in bed about to go to sleep, but even then,
3089140	3092280	it's usually because I just downloaded it that day and I wanted to check it out, and
3092280	3095320	then maybe 10 minutes, go to bed and then don't touch it again until I'm out and about.
3095320	3097360	Have they got an organ trail on the iPhone yet?
3097360	3098360	I'm sure they do.
3098360	3101900	There's all the time though, I sit here when I'm on, you know, chatting with people online
3101900	3108880	and I'll play, I'm playing Vi right now, which was an old NES RPG that they put out on my
3108880	3110880	phone. I've been playing that.
3110880	3116440	Alright, so anyhow, yeah I know I'm weird about the whole handheld thing, but sorry
3116440	3120880	I got off the original topic about the PSP App Store. I guess it's an inevitable thing.
3120880	3124960	How successful it'll be, I guess it all depends what apps are on it, if it has the must have
3124960	3128120	apps, but I don't see a lot of people just delaning it for the calculator.
3128120	3131960	Let's just put it this way, let's look at what other people have done, like the DSi
3131960	3133680	Store, their apps suck.
3133680	3136240	Alright, let's go to the phones. Hi, you're on Orange Longest Radio, who's this?
3136240	3139360	Hey, what's up everybody, this is Kajudo.
3139360	3140360	Hey, Kajudo?
3140360	3142360	Yeah, Kajudo, I don't know.
3142360	3149960	Alright, well hey, welcome to the show. What do you think about this whole PSP Store and
3149960	3153560	the PSP competing with the iPhone in a way?
3153560	3158120	Well, I don't own any of the PSPs, just because it just never appealed to me. I'm
3158120	3163680	more of a DS fan, where I like the innovation, and you know, they just seem to build games
3163680	3167520	for that system. The PSP to me just seems like, okay, you know, you want to take your
3167520	3172480	PS3 or your PlayStation 2 in the car, you can have that. And really, I'm not interested
3172480	3177360	in playing those types of games in my car, you know? I rather just a little simple point
3177360	3178360	and click type game.
3178360	3183880	But what I'm concerned about is this, what is it? The PSP Go?
3183880	3186360	Mm-hmm, the PSP Go.
3186360	3192840	Alright, what happens if I install these games on the PSP Go and I get my PSP stolen or I
3192840	3198160	lose it? That's like all my games are just basically down the drain now, right?
3198160	3203920	They're tied to your PlayStation Network accounts, just like if your PS3 got stolen or exploded
3203920	3206600	or something. So you can redownload them again.
3206600	3211400	Oh, okay, I didn't know that. I thought it was something where, you know, you buy it
3211400	3215320	off of their online store and it's saved on there, and if you lose it, then that's just
3215320	3216320	no problem.
3216320	3220560	No. Well, then that's certainly a valid concern, especially when you go to this whole digital
3220560	3225200	distribution. But yeah, I know on PlayStation Network, I mean, I don't buy anything for
3225200	3231000	the PSP. Well, it's the same deal. Once you buy something, it's yours and you can redownload
3231000	3235840	it later if you need to. But isn't there like a thing like, there's got to be a way to prevent
3235840	3239600	me from going to a friend's house and downloading the game and they play it? Like, they can't
3239600	3240600	play it if they're not signed in.
3240600	3244600	There, you can do that. I think you can link it to like a few different consoles or different
3244600	3249880	profiles, but basically you can download it, I think, in an unlimited amount of times on
3249880	3250880	your own profile.
3250880	3251880	Hmm.
3251880	3256800	And what if that service, for some reason, one day they no longer provide that download?
3256800	3261880	That's always another concern with me with things like, what is it, Valve? Steam, Steam.
3261880	3265680	I'm a little concerned with that. Like, what happens if one day Steam just goes away? Where
3265680	3267280	does my games go?
3267280	3271320	Then they go into oblivion, unfortunately, unless you have them downloaded to your system.
3271320	3275840	Well, I would think, I would hope the respectable thing to do would be to release, if your company's
3275840	3282320	about to go under, release something that's going to require, not require Steam anymore
3282320	3283320	for that.
3283320	3288100	Yes. That or the other option too, if you know that they're going to, you know, granted
3288100	3291800	I don't think the Sony source is going to up and die all of a sudden, but I mean, if
3291800	3297320	you've caught wind that, like, okay, starting December we're going to up and die, you know,
3297320	3301240	you could probably, you know, back those things up to your PC if you want to, since they've
3301240	3305600	just stored on, you know, the internal hard drive or memory stick or something. Well,
3305600	3310320	now, you know, nowadays they're on a memory stick and you can just back that stuff up,
3310320	3311320	but...
3311320	3316160	Oh, Bobby Blackwolf in chat would like to clarify, Steam has a failsafe for that reason.
3316160	3320200	They've already stated that. If they go under, they will remove the digital rights management.
3320200	3324040	So it's kind of like I speculated that they would do the right thing and just disable
3324040	3328080	the necessity of having Steam in the first place. So, well, hey, thank you so much for
3328080	3329640	the call and we appreciate it.
3329640	3334120	I just have one game recommendation for Loki. You just get the fashion gorilla.
3334120	3336640	I have it. I just haven't played it yet.
3336640	3340280	Oh, you got to try it. I mean, that's the only game that made me put down GPA because
3340280	3341440	I'm a GPA freak.
3341440	3346920	I really do want to play it and, you know, playing Saints of O2 today or, well, not today,
3346920	3351560	but earlier this week, because they have one of the vehicles from Red Faction in there.
3351560	3356160	It's like this SUV with a rocket launcher on top of it, which is awesome. But, you know,
3356160	3359520	I was like, oh, yeah, I really got to play that game. And I also have Prototype too,
3359520	3363880	so I have to go back to that and Fuel, I have to go play that. So there's a lot of stuff
3363880	3366120	and I just got my, you know, I'm trying to unpack right now.
3366120	3367960	Now is just not a good time to move.
3367960	3372540	It's not. You know, I had to unpack. You know, the summer is dead for me as far as what's
3372540	3376080	coming out. So, you know, it's a good time to get all these games now because then I
3376080	3377080	can play them through the summer.
3377080	3379080	All right. Well, thank you so much for the call.
3379080	3380080	Well, thank you for the show. Good night, guys.
3380080	3381080	All right. Take care, buddy.
3381080	3384520	All right. 1-877-GAME-OLR if you want to comment on stories.
3384520	3388320	We are going to move on to our next story tonight, which has to do with Microsoft. We've
3388320	3393680	been hazing Sony a lot tonight. Let's give Microsoft a little bit of hazing too. This
3393680	3396660	actually is a little bit of a follow-up to something we were talking about last week.
3396660	3399480	Last week, there was a rumor going around that Project Natal was actually going to be
3399480	3403680	the centerpiece of a new console that Microsoft is going to be releasing.
3403680	3407280	I thought that the rumor was actually that it was going to be treated like a console
3407280	3409400	launch and people thought that it was going to be a new console.
3409400	3414160	That's what I thought too, but also the fact that it was going to be like a, not so much
3414160	3419400	like a new console console, but like, you know how PlayStation 1 and then there's PlayStation
3419400	3424280	1 Slim a couple years later. I think the thought was there was going to be like an Xbox 360
3424280	3433440	Slim. Well, the CEO of Microsoft, Steve Ballmer, actually came out and said that, well, I'm
3433440	3437120	sorry, that actually, he was the guy that made that first remark about the whole Xbox
3437120	3442420	360 hardware integration that caused everybody to run with everything going on here.
3442420	3447320	The director of product management for Xbox 360 and Xbox Live, Aaron Greenberg, actually
3447320	3452960	straight up told Kotaku earlier this week, there will be no console. We're not going
3452960	3456900	to be launching a new console anytime soon. I really believe he was speaking about Project
3456900	3461120	Natal. We want to make sure people know that we're excited about Project Natal, but we're
3461120	3465640	barely halfway through this generation. We're happy with the Xbox 360, so there are no changes
3465640	3469760	from that standpoint. For the time being, we're really just showing a whole new category
3469760	3475300	of gaming. And then they're talking about, are they thinking about doing the hands-free
3475300	3480640	stuff in a new Xbox 360 configuration? They did say, yes, we have looked at that, but
3480640	3483240	we haven't seen, announced any details for something like that.
3483240	3487160	I think they're just really kind of lying by omission basically.
3487160	3495840	I think that's exactly what they're doing. I think there is. In a way, here's the most
3495840	3500800	important quotes from this. We are saying that the Natal will run on the Xbox 360, so
3500800	3506240	there's no new hardware to purchase. What we're doing that's unique is instead of asking
3506240	3511400	you to invest in a new generation of hardware, a generation that's already well established,
3511400	3515240	extending the experience even longer by adding this whole new category of experiences with
3515240	3519320	Project Natal. We're changing the rules just a little bit like we did with the new Xbox
3519320	3520320	experience.
3520320	3523880	It's just going to be, they're going to do a new console. It may be slimmed down, it
3523880	3528120	may not be slimmed down, but it's going to be some sort of a new revision, and it's going
3528120	3532880	to have Natal with it. That's basically it. It may be integrated into it if they decide
3532880	3536720	to actually slim down the form factor of it, but there will be a new console. There will
3536720	3542040	not be a new console because it's not going to be the Xbox, the next one, the 720 or whatever
3542040	3547040	you want to call it. It won't be a new console in that sense, but just like how the PlayStation
3547040	3553240	2, spelled out T-W-O, is not a new console, it's just a slimmer console. It's the same
3553240	3555760	console, but just, it's just...
3555760	3561500	You notice the way he's wording it. He's not saying no. He's not saying no. He's reassuring
3561500	3566360	people that they're not going to have to buy a new console to enjoy Project Natal. He didn't
3566360	3571160	come out and say, we're not releasing a new set of hardware. He didn't really say that.
3571160	3575000	He said, don't worry. Project Natal will work on your existing hardware. That's what I'm
3575000	3580680	hearing. He's reassuring people that they don't need to do this hardware upgrade, but
3580680	3582640	I still think there's going to be...
3582640	3585140	There has to be some perks to doing an upgrade.
3585140	3588800	I think there will be at least a bundle that comes with Natal. I think they're really going
3588800	3593260	to push this thing. Why shouldn't they? It is their answer to the Wii after all.
3593260	3597520	It's going to be kind of they're going to treat it like a new launch, so why not relaunch
3597520	3600560	the system? See, because that's what they're going to do. They're even going to probably
3600560	3607120	phrase it like that. This is the next generation in gaming, so let's launch it like the next
3607120	3609160	generation in gaming.
3609160	3614600	It's not like Microsoft doesn't make changes to their hardware ever, because earlier this
3614600	3618960	week it was reported that some of these new arcade units are out there, and they have
3618960	3622920	double the internal memory, which is funny because he references this whole, just like
3622920	3628220	we did with new Xbox experience, they work on the old Xbox, but in reality they did go
3628220	3631800	back and pump up the hardware a little bit. Because remember, you couldn't really have
3631800	3637200	NXE on your system if you didn't have a hard drive, or what was it? A memory card or something?
3637200	3642760	You had no memory. You can't even store NXE, but now there's hardware out there that they've
3642760	3648460	doubled the memory that it's now, what, 512 megs built in that can fit NXE and probably
3648460	3654560	some of the other stuff on your actual physical drive.
3654560	3656220	And they've gotten rid of the arcade games.
3656220	3661280	This kind of conflicts with what he's saying.
3661280	3663800	I knew this was coming a long time. Actually, it's funny.
3663800	3665400	I remember you saying something on the show.
3665400	3671400	Yes, I did. They were slowly transitioning. It was the console, they had the holiday bundles
3671400	3676960	that they can do with the games packed in, then they were going to have the console without
3676960	3683660	the games, and it was going to have the integrated memory, and then they were going to double
3683660	3689160	the memory inside it and get rid of the arcade games, and I think that's what this is now.
3689160	3692240	I'm not sure if they actually went through getting rid of the arcade games, but I think
3692240	3693240	they did.
3693240	3701860	Yeah, it's not surprising. They make little revisions. In this case, it's just so every
3701860	3706000	console now can have NXE stored on it, because it's important for them.
3706000	3710320	I hope that they do make a slimmer one. I could be talked into upgrading my system,
3710320	3711320	actually.
3711320	3712320	I wouldn't.
3712320	3718640	I don't have a cold-ass Xbox 360. I could be talked into it for HDMI, quieter system,
3718640	3722040	and maybe any other perks they're going to throw at me with new hardware.
3722040	3731800	It would be quieter because of the smaller chipsets, less heat, less need for a huge
3731800	3732800	fan.
3732800	3735760	But here's my concern. My old hard drive's not going to work with it, because if they
3735760	3738480	slim down the system, that massive drive's not going to fit on it.
3738480	3743760	No, they could. It'd be the same thickness, or maybe it'll plug into the top. They could
3743760	3744760	do it.
3744760	3748120	Interesting. I hope they do. I hope they do, because I wouldn't want to have to get a new
3748120	3752840	drive and all that stuff again. That would turn me off. We'll see.
3752840	3757280	I would think that they would. I mean, look at the police station slim. I mean, all the
3757280	3761200	peripherals, for the most part, worked with it. I mean, there's obviously no multi-tap
3761200	3769440	doesn't. So other interesting things, kind of going back to talking about Activision
3769440	3771440	again.
3771440	3778040	Activision had, I guess the prices for their new peripheral games are actually starting
3778040	3783040	to come out online. You know, as retailers like Amazon and GameStop and stuff like that
3783040	3787480	are starting to take preorders on them. And people are kind of shocked at how expensive
3787480	3788480	they are.
3788480	3792560	Now, this is Activision we're talking about here. I'm not shocked at how expensive they
3792560	3799920	are, but it is interesting, though. Like, for example, DJ Hero. I think we talked about
3799920	3804900	this a little bit before. It's going to retail for $120, and it's, of course, bundled in
3804900	3811520	with the DJ controller, which, when you look at, like, previously releases, like, say,
3811520	3817160	you know, Guitar Hero with a guitar bundled with it, that's typically been $99.99 for
3817160	3823000	an Xbox 360 or PlayStation 3 version. The PlayStation 2 version, though, is coming out
3823000	3827720	at $99.99, so there is, like, a $30 premium on all these different games.
3827720	3833480	Another game that's coming out for that same $120 price point would be the new Tony Hawk
3833480	3837560	game. But, you know, once again, the controller with it is kind of sophisticated. There is
3837560	3842400	a lot of equipment in there, so maybe that's why the price point's a little higher.
3842400	3848840	But what is really interesting, though, is Band Hero, the little-known, you know, Guitar
3848840	3853000	Hero game kind of aimed towards the family. They have a super bundle that's basically
3853000	3859440	coming out that's going to include, supposedly, like, a drum kit, a guitar, and, you know,
3859440	3864880	microphone, kind of what you got in World Tour, and that's going to run you $199, whereas
3864880	3869760	the World Tour kit, you know, runs you a lot less than that. So, it's kind of interesting,
3869760	3874080	though, that they're kind of pumping up everything by, like, $30. And, you know, what's funny
3874080	3878080	is when I read about this, I was kind of wondering, maybe they're throwing in, like, two guitars
3878080	3884160	and a drum set or something like that. But I looked at the weights comparing World Tour
3884160	3888800	and Band Hero's bundles, and the weights are almost identical. So it is going to be the
3888800	3893800	same bundle as you got with World Tour. They're not actually adding anything more to it. It's
3893800	3899560	just, for whatever reason, they think that they can get, you know, extra money for it.
3899560	3902920	Maybe that's, you know, a little bit coming from, you know, maybe they think they can
3902920	3907640	do that since, you know, Beatles Rock Band is going to be $250. So maybe they think they're
3907640	3912440	justified in that sense. Okay, well, what's Band Hero bringing new to the table? I can
3912440	3917160	tell you what Beatles Rock Band is bringing new to the table. But what is, well, I don't
3917160	3920560	know, some folks might want to argue with me on that, but at the same time, I'm telling
3920560	3927040	you, put the Beatles Rock Band gameplay next to Guitar Hero Van Halen gameplay, and I'll
3927040	3931320	tell you what justifies that premium Beatles price. You know what I mean? Here's something
3931320	3937040	funny though, if you think about it, okay? Guitar Hero World Tour right now, I think
3937040	3942840	is like $180, if I remember correctly. I think it's like $179.99. In fact, I'm going to look
3942840	3947440	that up right now. But let's just assume, you know, with Guitar Hero 5 coming out, you
3947440	3952840	gotta think that they're probably going to do a price drop on Guitar Hero World Tour.
3952840	3956180	You know, because they gotta clear out the extra units that they have, and maybe they're
3956180	3960040	not going to do it right away, but you would think that they're going to drop it, because
3960040	3964680	that's what they normally do. They drop the version that came out last year, you know,
3964680	3968360	in preparation for the new one. So you've got the bundles that are available out there
3968360	3975360	right now, you know, for World Tour, and say that you can get them for, I don't know, $150.00.
3975360	3982960	$149.99. I'm sure that's not too much of a stretch. Okay, so now you have this new game
3982960	3990920	coming out for $200.00. Why should I buy that bundle when I can buy a bundle with World
3990920	3995820	Tour, and I can buy the game only of Band Hero for the same price as buying the bundle
3995820	4004640	for Band Hero? It makes no sense whatsoever. So, I don't know. I mean, it does seem kind
4004640	4011640	of a rip-off to be spending that kind of money on a bundle that, you know, is readily available
4011640	4020120	right now for a cheaper price. And yeah, looks like World Tour, the band kits, okay, $190.00.
4020120	4026760	So they're still pretty expensive. Actually, $190.00, you know, right now, that wouldn't
4026760	4032640	be that, but it's still $10.00 more than, you know. But, you know, what, for $10.00
4032640	4036960	for what? Even $10.00 is $10.00 still. Yeah. Especially considering, you know, they're
4036960	4041080	not bringing that much new to the table, it sounds like. But here's my thing. I'm going
4041080	4045760	back to the DJ Hero thing for a minute, because I'm excited about DJ Hero. It looks like the
4045760	4051240	game's going to be pretty cool. The song list looks pretty awesome. It looks innovative,
4051240	4054920	this whole thing. But when I heard it was $120.00, it was like getting kicked in the
4054920	4061680	crotch. Like, $120.00 is a lot of money. And, you know, I'll tell you what, if they had
4061680	4066560	said $99.00, I would have been like, sold, gonna buy it, I'm there, yep, I got it, day
4066560	4072200	gone, right? But it's that third digit that makes all the difference, in my mind, as a
4072200	4076480	consumer. I don't know what it is. I'm very disappointed. I gotta see what I'm getting
4076480	4081440	for my, you know, $120.00. Honestly, I'm still probably going to buy it, because it's a game
4081440	4085880	that really interests me, and the price, you know. I want to get the actual special bundle
4085880	4091200	with the carrying case and a lot of fun stuff, because that, I like to travel with my game
4091200	4096920	consoles and peripherals and stuff like that. So that, you know, would appeal to me. But
4096920	4101520	I want to see what I'm getting for this $120.00, because it's kind of expensive for, you know,
4101520	4106920	and I know the peripheral is kind of neat, but I'm sorry, it's a turntable. It can't
4106920	4112040	be that sophisticated. It's, we've had BeatMania controllers out there, and I mean, really,
4112040	4116460	we're not talking too much different than that. And hell, the guitars aren't even that
4116460	4124280	sophisticated. So, where's the money going? Yeah, that's kind of why I'm curious about
4124280	4128920	that too. And I think what also really sucks is that you can't really demo DJ Hero, you
4128920	4133720	know what I mean? You're going to have to either play it in a store, play it at a friend's,
4133720	4138680	or take a chance. And you want to hear something funny? This is coming from a company that's
4138680	4146760	bitching about the price being too high for the Playstation 3. Funny, I didn't even think
4146760	4152920	about that. You're absolutely right. You know, oh, the Playstation 3's too high? Hell, that's
4152920	4158760	almost the price of our, you know, what is it? Banned Hero. If they drop the Playstation
4158760	4164840	3 price another $100.00, it will be the price of their Banned Hero bundle. I'm sorry, that
4164840	4173760	seems kind of a rip-off to me. But, you know, at the same time, you know, Banned Hero seems
4173760	4179120	kind of a rip-off anyways. I mean, why do we need that many games out at the same time?
4179120	4183000	I mean, and we haven't really seen anything about it, other than I saw a trailer that
4183000	4186940	said Banned Hero on it, and that's about it. And honestly, I couldn't have told you if
4186940	4191440	that was Guitar Hero 5 or Banned Hero what? I think we talked about this on the show last
4191440	4196640	week. I thought it was Guitar Hero 5. I thought the name of Guitar Hero 5 was Banned Hero.
4196640	4200240	And I do a show about games every week. I'm supposed to be on top of this stuff. I literally
4200240	4203480	thought Guitar Hero 5 was just called Banned Hero. I thought that's what it was. It was
4203480	4210600	the same game. I was like, no, they're putting out two? Really? Do we need that? Well, okay,
4210600	4214000	Van Halen's coming out at the beginning of August. Guitar Hero 5's coming out at the
4214000	4221280	beginning of September. Banned Hero's coming out in October. That's too much. That is a
4221280	4226640	lot. I don't know. Yeah, I don't know. I'm not feeling it. Especially, you know they're
4226640	4231960	going to charge like 50 bucks for Guitar Hero or Van Halen. It's too much. Yep. Too much.
4231960	4236960	Alright, well, I guess that's them. We'll see how this sells, of course, and how you
4236960	4240800	guys anticipate it. Not a lot of chat. They're talking about pay goal in the chat room. I
4240800	4245560	guess there's not a lot of care about DJ Hero or Banned Hero. I don't know. Alright, well
4245560	4251040	that's what it is. Let's shift topics and talk about another game. And this game definitely
4251040	4257040	has its cult following, which used to be me many, many years ago. Magic the Gathering.
4257040	4264880	Hey, hey, hey. That was me in college in Alabama. And it was me in high school many years ago,
4264880	4268480	actually. I've actually got a couple magic decks over here. I got them for free. Here's
4268480	4272800	the thing about Magic the Gathering. Say what you will. Call me whatever name you want in
4272800	4277720	the book. I do think Magic the Gathering is actually a lot of fun. It's just a good game.
4277720	4284440	Like I think it's a good card game to play. But it can be a lot of money. Like I remember
4284440	4287000	you know with the cards and everything, like paying the money to get the cards. It can
4287000	4291740	be a lot of money. And the reason why I bring this up now is that Magic the Gathering is
4291740	4296680	making a comeback of sorts. Magic the Gathering was just released on Xbox Live this week.
4296680	4300720	I'm not sure if you guys caught it amongst all the downtime. And I didn't even mention
4300720	4305480	it in my gaming week, but that's because I played a demo, not the full version. But Xbox
4305480	4310920	Live now has Magic the Gathering, Duels of the Planeswalkers. It is there. You can download
4310920	4315340	this game. It's available. And in the game, it's basically, you know, you can put together
4315340	4318840	your own. From what I understand, I haven't played the full version. But from what I understand,
4318840	4323480	because in the demo you're limited to like one battle with a green card only deck basically.
4323480	4330000	But the enemy has a red card only deck. Which means you're screwed? I guess, yeah. In the
4330000	4333400	full version of the game, you can kind of make your own deck. You can do your own thing
4333400	4338920	with it, you know, of the cards that are there. You gain and lose cards as you fight enemies
4338920	4344320	and so forth. So yeah, it's hard for me. And like Lazy Days in chat says, demos don't count.
4344320	4347400	Yes. I don't want to base my evaluation of the game off of it. So I'm not going to tell
4347400	4352200	you whether to buy it or not. I will just say, you know, it was kind of neat to see
4352200	4356000	a resurgence of Magic the Gathering. But what I do think is interesting is that they're
4356000	4361780	talking about download content. Here's the thing though. Download content is not going
4361780	4366480	to work the way that it does for Magic the Gathering online. Because you have to remember
4366480	4371580	there's now three ways to play Magic the Gathering. You have Xbox Live. You have the card, good
4371580	4377360	old card and table and all that stuff. Or you have Magic the Gathering online. The interesting
4377360	4383240	thing about Magic the Gathering online, they have really tried to mirror the card playing
4383240	4388440	experience right on down to what you pay for it. If you weren't aware, if you want to play
4388440	4393480	Magic the Gathering online, it's essentially free. You have to pay $10. And I did a little
4393480	4397000	research today. I've never played Magic the Gathering online, but I did some research.
4397000	4401760	If I wanted to play, what would it take? You pay it like a $10 registration fee, but that
4401760	4408760	$10 goes towards a coupon that you use in their store. And you buy decks just like walking
4408760	4412640	into a comic book store and buying a deck. You buy booster packs just like you would
4412640	4418040	buy a booster pack in a store of 12 random cards or what have you. And it's the same
4418040	4423040	price with tax and all that stuff. So you literally, but they make it very clear. There
4423040	4428920	is no, you don't buy these things online and then get a paper copy of the card. Just like
4428920	4433400	you don't buy the paper cards and get an online code to get the same card. That is not how
4433400	4436240	it works. Which it should though, because that'd be pretty cool. There's two different
4436240	4440680	games here. Magic the Gathering online and Magic the Gathering paper. But the reason
4440680	4446400	why I bring this whole thing up is because that now they have this download content.
4446400	4450720	The deal is you're not going to get booster packs with Xbox Live download content. You're
4450720	4455760	basically buying all new decks. There's no random cards. You know what you're going to
4455760	4461880	be getting out of this when you go in to buy it. And this is from an interview on Destructoid.com.
4461880	4466320	Senior brand manager Worth Woolport actually was quoted saying, a good way to think of
4466320	4470800	it is like the old theme decks or our current intro decks. It's that kind of option to add
4470800	4476240	onto your gaming experience. And it's all set. It's not randomized at all. By the way,
4476240	4482320	they're also going to have themes, play mats, like the background you can buy. Yeah. And
4482320	4489720	gamer pictures. Okay. But what about for the people that's over it? I mean, what appeal
4489720	4494120	is it going to have for all the people who've moved on? Is there anything that's going to
4494120	4499820	bring anyone back? What about the face to face, you know, playing with somebody? Well,
4499820	4503840	I don't know. I actually, to be honest, Jamie, I think this is it to bring the old people
4503840	4507880	back is that you don't have to put up with the boosters and all these extra little costs
4507880	4512520	here. I, I, in a way, I think if I was going to play Magic the Gathering more regularly,
4512520	4518360	this is appealing to me. When I played, when I played Magic regularly, I loved being able
4518360	4523840	to collect all the rare cards and to, you know, to have the collection that other people
4523840	4527920	went, ooh. But wouldn't it bug you when someone when you were playing would pull out that
4527920	4532320	effing card that you, is so rare, there's no way in hell you're going to get it. You
4532320	4535360	know, that type of thing and then it's being used in a match. I mean, one thing you can
4535360	4539840	say about the Microsoft way of doing it on Xbox Live, everybody's on the same page. Everybody's
4539840	4544960	on equal free. See, that, that's not fun to me. If I wanted to play, you know, a certain
4544960	4549120	type of match, you know, I would say, hey, do you have a type two deck? Do you have a
4549120	4553320	type one deck? You know, do you have old school type one? I don't even know what that means.
4553320	4557000	That's funny. That's true for tournament. I used to do tournament play. Wow. Back in
4557000	4561960	the day. And I just say like, hey, you know, if you've got this type of deck, then we'll
4561960	4565760	play this kind of game. If you want to bring out the, the strong stuff, you know, we would
4565760	4571960	actually set up those parameters first. So it was a much broader scope of play if you
4571960	4577560	had this together. I've seen people take out wimpy ass starter pack decks and beat people
4577560	4583520	with, you know, the hardcore expensive deck just because they were a better player. So
4583520	4587480	I think that that actually removes an aspect of the challenge. I think that it takes out
4587480	4593840	some of the fun. I mean, not everyone is going to be equal. I'm sorry. There's no such thing
4593840	4599800	as everybody equal. You may be able to match the cards, you know, for everybody, but you're
4599800	4605560	never going to match the skill. And I think that that really takes away a lot of the experience
4605560	4609080	in play. Well, from what I understand, you still build your own deck. It's just that
4609080	4613160	everybody has the same card pool to build from. And yeah, okay. You're a collector by
4613160	4618520	nature. Jamie, you, you collect video games, you collect systems, you collect lots of stuff.
4618520	4624040	You're a collector by nature. I can see your argument for me. That's too much money. I
4624040	4629400	can't, I can't do it. I will tell you, I spent a lot of money on this as a kid. My first
4629400	4635120	collection. Oh, that's right. You were a kid, weren't you? I was playing, I was playing
4635120	4638880	in college. I would have been, I wasn't that far behind you. I was playing this when I
4638880	4641960	was a sophomore, junior in high school. You were what, two years older than me. So right
4641960	4649240	around the same there. Yeah. Um, what, um, Loki was a child, not a child, but the whole
4649240	4656840	thing is that I actually built up a collection, sold it for about a $1,500 of D and D books,
4656840	4662840	which I still have. And then probably rebuilt my collection just because, you know, it's,
4662840	4667880	it's its own currency. You have to be smart with the building and trading. And you know,
4667880	4671440	my last collection by that time I didn't care anymore. Nobody wanted to pay what it was
4671440	4679440	worth, but still it's, it's a matter of what are you in it for? You know, oh, for a lot
4679440	4685760	of people, the fun comes not just in the playing, but in the having. Our, our good friend, Marissa's
4685760	4690960	in chat, Marissa Congusto and says, I was in elementary school for the win. Don't I
4690960	4697720	feel like grandpa? Oh, we do love Marissa though. And we wanted to come visit the show,
4697720	4702760	by the way, Marissa or Jamie and I are just going to have to end up in LA at the same
4702760	4706200	weekend and make that habit. All right. And Loki somehow is going to have to be talked
4706200	4710480	into making the trip. Um, let's see. I do want to say though, I, what else I thought
4710480	4715320	was interesting about this whole magic, the gathering story was that, uh, they also, in
4715320	4719960	this interview, uh, the brand manager would not really say how much it's going to cost
4719960	4725560	because he says, as far as price, all that stuff is dictated by Microsoft. The game itself
4725560	4731800	came out at 800 Microsoft points, which we think is an absolute steal of value. Frankly,
4731800	4739440	you can almost hear that hidden subtext of we think this game is undervalued by Microsoft.
4739440	4744000	And I think to the hardcore fans, maybe it is. I mean, think about it. 10 bucks gets
4744000	4751520	you what some people have spent lots more money on another online gaming platform to
4751520	4756520	have. That's fascinating to me. I don't know why. Maybe I'm just weird. Maybe it's the
4756520	4759760	memories I have. I'm sure they would have done booster packs and stuff if they had a
4759760	4765080	way to do random cards like that. But because you know, it's, you know, pay X amount of
4765080	4773720	points download, you know, this data done, you know, it's just, I don't know. You can't
4773720	4779760	do it too bad for them. I do want to check out the full version of the game though. I
4779760	4783640	think I will probably die as soon as I finish up some of this final fantasy and other stuff
4783640	4787400	I've been playing. I'll probably get a little more into magic, the gathering, and I would
4787400	4792680	love to play Jamie on Xbox live, but I don't know if she'll want to spend the 10 bucks.
4792680	4799480	It might be fun though. God, it really has been years. Me too. Me too. I bear two decks
4799480	4804600	here on my desk. Rob, when I was going through that tutorial, I was like, Oh my God, this
4804600	4808000	is almost too much to remember. Like I wait, I have to hit a button to interrupt if I want
4808000	4812280	to actually use this. So, Oh my gosh, she really does. She just whipped it out. It's
4812280	4818440	a sealed deck for God's sake. I challenge you, Rob. Ready to play 30 card deck and quick
4818440	4823320	start guide. For real, these are two starter decks? Two starter decks. I challenge you,
4823320	4828440	Rob. You should have a battle on the show. Not right now. Not right now. Maybe like it's
4828440	4831920	a special one off show or something. We have a white deck and a green deck, which means
4831920	4838960	it'll be a fucking long game. We should do this as like a special spinoff show or something.
4838960	4843720	And maybe Loki can provide commentary. I don't know what the hell's going on, nor do I care.
4843720	4847640	That would be what was funny about it. If this has that phasing bullshit in it though,
4847640	4852480	I'm out. What the hell is phasing? I don't even know. Actually I stopped playing when
4852480	4856360	they put in phasing, which means like one card is in play for one turn and then you
4856360	4862480	have to skip the next one with that card. And then, so they phase and bullshit. Weird.
4862480	4870480	I'm sorry, Rob. My deck was black red. I would spawn thralls and throw fireballs and people
4870480	4875880	hated it. All right. This battle is happening. This must happen. You've got the white deck.
4875880	4878600	I've got the green deck. Fine. Whatever. I don't care. Well, you're holding the white
4878600	4882240	deck, so I'm just saying. But we need to set a time. Sealed deck tourney. All right. Sealed
4882240	4890520	deck tourney. And I haven't played in years. And they are sealed completely sealed. I will
4890520	4895160	take a picture and put it on the website so that you can see that they're sealed. How
4895160	4899880	about we do this on, what are you doing on Wednesday, Rob? Uh, I have to check with the
4899880	4905400	significant other, but I think I will be free. Bring the significant other. It's on. He's
4905400	4911000	going to think it's the dumbest thing. We're going to get sandwiches and a beer. No, not
4911000	4916600	beer. We're going to get sandwiches and lemonade and play magic. If this weekend wasn't birthday
4916600	4920480	slash pride slash whatever, I would say, let's do it this weekend. But, and then you're going
4920480	4925120	to Las Vegas the next week, huh? You're going to be gone. All right, we'll make it happen.
4925120	4930400	We'll figure something out behind the scenes. We are, this is going to be, it will be all
4930400	4934120	right. Uh, and of course the chat is very supportive of the whole magic, the gathering
4934120	4940360	sealed deck tournament. We should turn it into a drinking game. We've got the geekery
4940360	4945680	instead of 20 life points. We should have 20 shot glass. Rob, this is so fucking ridiculous.
4945680	4950760	Especially since how would you get your life back? You just, I don't know. Especially since
4950760	4955240	I haven't really wanted to play magic in forever. I just got the decks cause they were freaking
4955240	4959840	free. I thought I'd give them to somebody or we'd give them away on the show. How about
4959840	4966320	this? How about the winning deck is a giveaway or we'll just give all the cards away to somebody
4966320	4969800	who actually listens to our tournament show. All right, look, we're spending too much time
4969800	4974680	talking about a future project. We will look into that and do that later. Anyhow, um, let's
4974680	4979140	move on. We're going to kind of bring part a to a close here. Uh, getting into the classic
4979140	4984880	game of the week. But before we do that, actually let's get into some release dates. Um, we
4984880	4988880	like to travel the world and talk to you guys about what is coming out around the world.
4988880	4993320	And we'll start off with dark soccer with the UK release dates, whole crap ton of stuff.
4993320	4999200	Um, we have on the 23rd follow up three point lookout and then we've got on the 26th, the
4999200	5005200	whole bunch of stuff. Another code are a journey into lost memories. Um, Arma two, is that
5005200	5010920	it? Um, a dynasty warrior, six empires of fight night round four guitar hero, greatest
5010920	5018920	hits blah. Um, monster hunter, freedom unite overlord to overlord, dark legends, overlord
5018920	5025440	minions, and pretty, can I really be a hero and superstars VA racing.
5025440	5035800	Hmm, cool. Um, let's see, in the US, uh, we've actually got a little bit coming out this
5035800	5044400	week. Um, starting off, we've got, uh, monster hunter freedom unite on the PSP. That's a
5044400	5050440	pretty good game there. Uh, dynasty warriors, six empires coming out on PS3 and Xbox 360
5050440	5055520	this week. Uh, transformers revenge of the fallen coming out on pretty much all platforms
5055520	5061280	including two versions on the DS split up between autobots and decepticons to celebrate
5061280	5066440	the new movie coming out this week. Um, my healthy cooking coach for the DS and enhanced
5066440	5071080	for the DSi with, uh, lots of recipes. In fact, you get some exclusive recipes if you
5071080	5076400	have the DSi system. That is such bullshit. It is crap. Yes, it is. I am sorry, but that's
5076400	5083080	Ubisoft. You can thank Ubisoft for that. Um, overlord, overlord two coming out on PS3 and
5083080	5093440	Xbox 360. Um, overlord minions on DS and overlord dark legend on the Wii. And, um, also this
5093440	5101720	week, uh, resident evil archives. That's going to be, um, your first, uh, I guess port of
5101720	5106560	the resident evil games. You've got the first game now with the new Wii controls. Um, the
5106560	5113640	old GameCube port. And then Conduit, um, the Wii shooter game finally making its way out.
5113640	5120880	Fight Night round four coming out on Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3. Um, Spore Galactic
5120880	5126280	Adventures, which actually doesn't look bad from, uh, the video that I saw talking about
5126280	5132880	the robot chicken stuff. And, um, that's coming out on PC. Uh, Discovery Kids Parrot Pals
5132880	5138880	is yet another, I don't know, sim game. Um, I wonder if you can make the parrots repeat
5138880	5142880	you in their parrot voice. That'd be kind of funny. Um, the PlayStation 2 is getting
5142880	5149600	a bundle of two of the PlayStation, um, portable ports for Grand Theft Auto. Um, Liberty City
5149600	5156280	Stories and Vice City Stories bundle coming out for 30 bucks retail. That's not too bad.
5156280	5164640	And, um, on DS some more schlock. Uh, Fashion Week Junior Designer coming from 505 Games.
5164640	5170960	And, um, Donna Discovery, a real time strategy game. Uh, that's coming out on the Wii and
5170960	5179760	I believe the DS. And... Classic Word Games, another one from Ubisoft, also enhanced for
5179760	5185280	the DSi. Um, that's coming out on DS. I just think that's a horrible thing to do to the
5185280	5190640	casual audience. I, I just, you know, not that these are games I would ever buy anyway.
5190640	5194220	I just think that's a mean thing to do to the casual audience. Especially when you're,
5194220	5198180	it's not like you're using the new hardware for this. You're, you're using, you know,
5198180	5201840	it's just plain and simple. It's all, all the enhancements, um, for like that cooking
5201840	5207120	game. It was 20 more recipes and you got to take your picture and put it in as the chef
5207120	5210880	picture or something like that. Now if that was the main enhancement then fine. That is
5210880	5216200	something that the DSi hardware can do that the DS just simply cannot do. But this whole
5216200	5222760	like withholding recipes or game, mini games or what have you, just sucks. Um, Shimagami
5222760	5232960	Tensei Devil Summoner on DS coming out this week. And, and lastly, Penya Fantasy Golf
5232960	5239160	on PSP will be making it out this week. And that is it. Let's go over to Japan who's had
5239160	5243240	a lot of weeks in a row of empty releases but actually there's a lot of stuff coming
5243240	5247880	out this week. On the Xbox 360, Blazblue or Blazblue, however you want to say that there,
5247880	5250840	is finally making its way out. I know that is definitely being looked forward to by fighting
5250840	5254780	game fans on the Xbox 360 in Japan. There's also a fighting stick to match that's coming
5254780	5258680	out with that by the way. Fight Night Round 4 makes its way to the Asian regions, not
5258680	5263640	just Japan but sometimes in this segment I also cover the rest of Asia. Um, also coming
5263640	5272880	out in Japan, Mamoru-kun wa Norawa Ete Shimata comes out as well. Which is, um, it's a port
5272880	5281040	from the arcades that, it's a shooter game that looks a lot like, um, Hikaruuga. But
5281040	5286760	I don't, I think it's different. More anime based. So, that's a shmup that's coming out.
5286760	5292360	Uh, that is coming out by the way from G-Rev is the company that's putting that out. Um,
5292360	5298360	also coming out on other systems, going over to the Playstation 3, Agarest Senki Zero comes
5298360	5305480	out in Japan from Idea Factory this week. And this is a type of like, it kind of looks
5305480	5312540	like a sim type of game mixed with a role playing game. Which could be kind of interesting.
5312540	5318540	But that is coming out over there on the Playstation 3. As well as another version of BlazBlue
5318540	5322600	and Fight Night Round 4 also making its way to the Asian regions. So it's pretty much
5322600	5329920	matches the Xbox 360 dates pretty well. But they also have one other game, Rorona no Atelier
5329920	5336440	Arland no Renken Sushi comes out. And that is on several different types of box sets
5336440	5341880	and so forth. And I do see that this guy is using like magical sushi in a role playing
5341880	5348360	type of format there. So, I think that's gotta be based on some other type of series over
5348360	5354640	there. The game looks very stylish though, I will give it that. It looks kind of neat.
5354640	5361480	Coming out on some other systems on the Nintendo Wii, Wii Sports Resort, by the way, is coming
5361480	5366960	out this week in Japan. That's a pretty big deal. Yeah, so that is coming out in Japan
5366960	5371440	and that's really the only thing of note over there. I'm gonna skip past Playstation 2 dates
5371440	5377680	and go straight to the Nintendo DS. Fushugi Yugi gets a game on the DS this week. There's
5377680	5385280	a Fushugi Yugi game? On the DS this week. Let me see. Bringing up some picture in studio
5385280	5392180	to satisfy Dark Sakura. Oh dear god. There it is. Oh, it looks like it's kind of a sim
5392180	5397440	type. Yeah, definitely looks like a sim. Fushugi Yugi is two romantic adventures combined into
5397440	5402020	one DS card. Become the Miko destined to save a nation from calamity and meet all the handsome
5402020	5405880	bodyguards along the way. The fans who have read the manga may already know who the heroines
5405880	5409720	end up with, but now with you and the Miko's robes, you don't have to end things the way
5409720	5413160	the anime or manga did. That sounds kind of fun. Too bad I can't read any of it. So it's
5413160	5417280	kind of like reverse dating sim because now you get to date boys. There you go. That'd
5417280	5422300	be fun if that one got a release over here, but I doubt it. And the game, I like the name
5422300	5428200	of this game. It's a game called Really? Really? DS. That is the name of it. Really? It should
5428200	5433960	be Oh Really? Maybe that'll be the American release and instead of about two girls, it'll
5433960	5440080	be about an owl. Although that would be a completely different game altogether. Although
5440080	5444400	from what I understand, Scribblenauts has the Oh Really? Owl in it. Sweet. All the more
5444400	5448520	reason to buy it. You remember we told Bobby about it. Oh no, you weren't there. I told
5448520	5451640	him to go try it the last day and I know he talked about it in his show and I told him
5451640	5455720	do lolcats. It's funny. And I guess he tried the Oh Really? Owl and it actually worked.
5455720	5462400	So there you go. Quickly on the PSP, I want to mention, memories off after rain comes
5462400	5471520	out as well as Noko Aozora Nyakisuko Tenohira no Rakuen comes out in Japan. And the cover
5471520	5476480	art is this girl kneeling in the beach, reaching for your hand. It's probably another dating
5476480	5481120	sim. Oh yeah, there's two people. No, three people in bed together. What is that? No,
5481120	5487000	it's probably a family. It's a family baby. It's not that hot. Alright. Looks like a dating
5487000	5494760	sim. Alright, so there you go. The best dating sims have three people in bed at once. By
5494760	5500640	the way, the Fushugi Yugi got a big rise out of the chat room. What? Yes, indeed. There
5500640	5504680	it is. Alright, hey, we're gonna close out part A and get into part B tonight. We just
5504680	5510680	had a mention of the Tokimeki Memorial, which is like the big dating sim series. And yeah,
5510680	5515280	there is one for girls. It's called Tokimeki Memorial Girl Side. I do believe it's called
5515280	5519480	Girl Side. Alright, well, I stand corrected, but there's so many of those freaking dating
5519480	5524800	sims. Alright, let's get into a little piece of gaming history here. It's the segment of
5524800	5529520	the show where we have Dark Sakura open up the gaming archive and pick out a game that
5529520	5533800	she thinks, you know what, time has neglected this game. Well, not always. Actually, sometimes
5533800	5537280	time has treated the game very well. But she says, you know what, we need to take a minute
5537280	5540200	from all these current games we're playing right now and take a minute to respect the
5540200	5547040	classics. It's called our Classic Game of the Week. Dark Sakura's gonna pick a game
5547040	5551880	and share it with you all right now. The Classic Game of the Week. This is a very interesting
5551880	5556680	game called Silhouette Mirage. And I'm surprised I haven't done this one before. Actually,
5556680	5562240	I think I haven't done it because I thought I had done it before. So, cue music. Yes,
5562240	5569240	ma'am, here's some clip from Silhouette Mirage. This is actually from the Saturn version,
5569240	5575240	which is the one that I really want most of all. It has really good music, by the way.
5575240	5583240	It's a game that's put out by Treasure. And it was initially on the Sega Saturn and then
5583240	5589440	had a Playstation release. Well, the Saturn Japanese release was in 1997 and then came
5589440	5596120	out in 98 on Playstation. And then Working Designs brought out the Playstation version
5596120	5602920	later, actually on December 31st, 1999, which I have that version. And honestly, after playing
5602920	5607360	the Saturn version, the Saturn version is better. But that's what happens with a lot
5607360	5617480	of Saturn's Playstation versions. Anyway, you basically play through the game where
5617480	5625640	you have different sorts of natures. One is Silhouette, one is Mirage. And so you actually
5625640	5632880	play as a character that has both of those attributes and can play them. I don't know
5632880	5637400	if you can see in the movie file, Rob. Yeah, she's like flip it from blue to red. Yeah,
5637400	5641120	when she moves one way, she's red. And when she moves the other, she's blue. That's kinda
5641120	5648360	interesting. Well, it's very similar to Gunstar Heroes in how it plays. But you have to really
5648360	5655480	make sure that you're the same type of matches, which actually in the Japanese version, you
5655480	5661000	can't absorb it, but you can in the U.S. one. And then you also have to make sure that you're
5661000	5666880	attacking with the opposite type of whatever the creature you're fighting is. So, it's
5666880	5672520	really, really difficult. I mean, it's seriously. But then again, treasure games are freaking
5672520	5681360	difficult. So basically, the main character is called Shina Nera Shina, which I thought
5681360	5687920	they did something stupid to it in the U.S., so I'm not even gonna bother with that. So,
5687920	5695360	she's very little, and she has both aspects to her. And so basically, she is basically
5695360	5702160	the one who they're picking to go out and, you know, fight all the baddy baddies. And
5702160	5711560	then you have to, you work for a computer called Gehenna that keeps you updated on everything.
5711560	5716280	Then you have to fight all of the silhouettes and the mirages and, you know, fight the bad
5716280	5725560	guys and make it through the game. And you actually get beings that will help you out
5725560	5735560	that are based off the seven deadly sins. Sins. You get sloth, you get lusty, angry,
5735560	5743280	gluttony, envy, covetous, and pride. And they help you along the way with different projectile
5743280	5752780	type attacks. So, there's also some different modes in the PlayStation one. You actually
5752780	5760880	have some other things. You have the Reaper and Galoob bosses that are only in the PlayStation
5760880	5767280	version. And so they actually modified the story, added a new dialogue, new levels, another
5767280	5773400	ending. And they were intended for the Saturn version, but the rumor is that they let the
5773400	5780840	Saturn version out and all that was in it. Also, for the, they made it harder for the
5780840	5786520	American version, which I think was really freaking hard. They made it harder. Seriously,
5786520	5793360	harder. What you're seeing there, Rob, is easy. They made it hard. I really suck at
5793360	5800120	the PlayStation American one. You also have a debug mode. You have Super Core Fighter
5800120	5806800	2, which you can play between Shaina and Zohar, one of the other characters. They also, of
5806800	5817600	course, edited some of the sprites in the game. Like, one of them, a character's cigarette
5817600	5823380	was replaced with a gloved hand, you know, instead of holding a cigarette. And a burning
5823380	5831300	cross was replaced with a dragon. So, but that is classic treasure.
5831300	5834520	Another treasure to add to our pile in the classic game of the week, but they did do
5834520	5843120	some great games. I mean, if you want to look at the things Treasure's given us, Gunstar
5843120	5854880	Heroes, Doki Doki Mischief Mage Curse, Bongayo, Ikaruga, Radiant Silver Gun, seriously, Treasure
5854880	5860360	is like, they're aptly named. All right. Well, there you go, your classic
5860360	5864840	game of the week, Silhouette Mirage, available on the Saturn, or if you were in for a challenge,
5864840	5874720	the PlayStation. So, there you go. That's going to do it for this part A of our show,
5874720	5881360	but we've got plenty more show when we come back, including our part B tonight. We have
5881360	5885880	the rapid fire news. We have some other discussion topics we're going to get into, and of course,
5885880	5891120	your emails at Mailbag at OrangeloungeRadio.com. We will be back right after a quick break
5891120	5900000	with more of Orange Lounge Radio. Stay tuned, guys.
5900000	5904440	And welcome back, everybody, here on this lovely Sunday evening, June the 21st of 2009,
5904440	5911360	for part B of Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 328. We tape live every week on AllGames.com,
5911360	5917520	available at Radio.AllGames.com, and we put out our podcast every week as well, getting
5917520	5920880	back on the ball with that, so you lovely people that listen to us on the podcast can
5920880	5924280	stay on top of our show, although if you've never joined us for a live experience, you
5924280	5927040	really need to set a date, because it's a lot of fun, and when you can participate in
5927040	5931120	our chat room and call in and all that good stuff, Chat.OrangeloungeRadio.com, or our
5931120	5935520	telephone, 1-877-GAME-OLR. We have been getting a lot of phone calls tonight, but I imagine
5935520	5940880	we probably will later during open bar topics. Anyhow, I do want to point out tonight, we
5940880	5945600	have a list list coming up, and the list list question we're going to do tonight, we haven't
5945600	5948480	done this segment in a while, I'll explain how it works in a little bit, but for you
5948480	5952240	long time OLR listeners, you probably haven't heard us do one of these in a while. It's
5952240	5956320	been a while. We're actually stealing the question this week from Kotaku, who had an
5956320	5959720	interview with Reggie Fils-Aime, and they were doing this whole little chain question
5959720	5963840	thing, so basically Reggie Fils-Aime actually got to ask the listeners something. In the
5963840	5969240	same vein of Team Ninja working with Nintendo to reimagine Metroid, what development group
5969240	5974720	would you like to see partner and collaborate with Nintendo, and what franchise? So basically,
5974720	5979720	to make it short, dream developer, dream franchise, but a Nintendo franchise. We're going to be
5979720	5982880	getting into that a little later, and if you want to vote and participate in tonight's
5982880	5988800	list list and have a say, Chat.OrangeloungeRadio.com is the place to be. Meanwhile, we're going
5988800	5993200	to get into some rapid fire news, some topics that we're not going to talk a lot about,
5993200	5996520	but we wanted to let you know what's going on anyway. Dar-Sakura, what's the rapid fire
5996520	6005800	news tonight? Well, for our friends over in the UK, if this is actually until July 3rd,
6005800	6018240	you can get a gold subscription to Xbox Live for basically one pound. And then, of course,
6018240	6022740	you know, afterwards you can pay a regular price if you want to keep it. But seriously,
6022740	6028560	one quid for one month, that's not bad. Good way to get your foot in the door. Pretty much,
6028560	6037240	see how you like it. Also, some games coming out, WiiWare and DSiWare. We actually have
6037240	6049520	Let's Catch, which is put out by Yuji Naka. It's to go along with Let's Tap, so it's catching
6049520	6055920	that game. And then we have Ikarian Kindred Spirits, where you play as a little winged
6055920	6061760	girl called Nyx, who is trying to find Icarus. So. Aren't we all trying to find the sequel
6061760	6068360	to Icarus? Nay, you know, it could, I don't know if it's tied in, but hey, if it is, that
6068360	6078140	would be sweet. And then DSiWare gets a game called a little bit of Dr. Kawashima's Brain
6078140	6086200	Training Maths Edition. So, it's math. Which means I won't be getting this freaking game.
6086200	6096640	It's 810 points, by the way. And then, last but not least, we have Mass Effect for iPhone,
6096640	6103800	which is a side story. Actually, there was an NDA leak that came out last month. One
6103800	6112460	of the testers blurted out all this crap. So basically, it's not a bridging story, it's
6112460	6117240	just a little side story about one of the Mass Effect 2 characters. So, it's just like
6117240	6126900	a little fun option game. So, hey. That's it. Well, there's some interesting stuff coming
6126900	6133860	out actually on TV. You may remember Penn & Teller's show Bullshit. Well, they are taking
6133860	6142400	on JT Voldemort and talking about the evils of video games and violence and all that stuff.
6142400	6148760	If you're interested in watching it, the episode will be available on July 9th is when it's
6148760	6154560	supposed to air. You were talking about one of my favorite shows ever, by the way. Coming
6154560	6163920	to Xbox Live Arcade in Japan. Garou, the Mark of the Wolves. Of course, SNK's arcade fighting
6163920	6169040	game and I'm sure it'll probably make its way over here at some point probably soon.
6169040	6173900	So that'll be available for 800 Microsoft points as well. And of course, the game was
6173900	6181180	originally released back in Japan in 1999 and in the US's Fatal Fury Mark of the Wolves.
6181180	6188040	That is the Final Fail Fury title. And last week we had a new Wii game come out and this
6188040	6195180	is talking about a throwback to the old laser disc days. But Digital Leisure has a live
6195180	6202280	action shooter game you may remember as Mad Dog McCree. They had three games in that series
6202280	6208820	and all three of those are available for $19.99 and one new pack for the Wii, Mad Dog McCree's
6208820	6214520	one slinger pack, which includes Mad Dog McCree, Mad Dog 2 The Lost Gold, and The Last Bounty
6214520	6222920	Hunter. So very interesting and old school crappiness. Another game that's going to be
6222920	6228240	heading its way to the Wii as well. Can I say though, those Mad Dog McCree games are
6228240	6232800	really trying to bank in on the nostalgia of those laser gun games and how cool they
6232800	6238920	were at the time because it was like OMG video. But by today's standards, please. And they
6238920	6244840	are $20 for all three games. So if you are really willing to buy it, I would suggest
6244840	6253460	waiting for it to really hit the bargain bin. I guess that's a cool value but still. A new
6253460	6258680	Monkey Ball trademark has been discovered and I guess based on the title, people are
6258680	6263360	assuming it's going to be using the new. God, it just wouldn't be a week if I didn't have
6263360	6270960	the wrong music in the wrong time. I can't stop it. There we go. Thank you. It's cursed!
6270960	6278720	The song is cursed. Apparently. Much like the game Super Monkey Ball, which now they've
6278720	6284020	got a new one coming out, Step and Roll, which people think, oh Step, the Wii Balance Board.
6284020	6289360	But hey, who doesn't like to whore out the Wii Balance Board? So that game will probably be coming soon.
6289360	6299360	From Sega. And then, that's it. I have a few stories I want to cover here real quick and
6299360	6303800	rapid fire news as well. We just started off with the story about the iPhone and Commodore
6303800	6307800	64 apparently has been ported over to the iPhone, which isn't much of a surprise. There's
6307800	6315120	other emulators as well. But here's the thing. Apparently, Manomio is the folks that put
6315120	6319560	this thing together, a Commodore 64 app on the iPhone. They did this together with a
6319560	6325400	Danish studio. Apparently, you can actually run this whole thing on your iPhone. But guess
6325400	6335180	what? Apple has rejected it because an application may not itself install or launch other executable
6335180	6341000	code by any means. That is something that is in the developer's kit. So, they're gonna
6341000	6343820	have to find a way around this if they want this app to come out on the phone. Or they
6343820	6347660	may have to do game by game or something. I don't know what. Apparently, Space Invaders
6347660	6353360	Extreme is gonna be getting some download content. It's Xbox Live Arcade's version,
6353360	6359480	of course. Gonna be getting some extra stages and some things. There you go. It's 240 Microsoft
6359480	6365120	points. I guess you get some original reimagining of the original Space Invaders and Space Invaders
6365120	6369880	2. That's a pretty good price. 240 points for two games and some download content. Not
6369880	6375720	much at all. That's not the price for Space Invaders Extreme, mind you. That is the price
6375720	6381860	of the add-on content. So, there you go. Also, Splatterhouse not coming out in 2009. Did
6381860	6385480	you even know they were remaking Splatterhouse? I mean, we've had a million stories on it
6385480	6389600	in the show. Yeah. But it seems like this is the new Duke Nukem Forever. But apparently
6389600	6395960	it is now coming out in 2010. Or so they say. I thought Duke Nukem Forever was cancelled,
6395960	6400440	finally. I don't know if we ever get the final word on that or not. I think it's still in
6400440	6404420	limbo. Because somebody could technically still take the code. Because wouldn't the
6404420	6408800	publisher now own the code? That's true. That's true. And get somebody else to finish it and
6408800	6414400	call it a done deal. It could happen. It could happen. Alright, we're gonna take some time
6414400	6419200	now to bring up your emails. Every week we let you guys send us emails. Mailbag at Orange
6419200	6422920	Orange Radio dot com and we respond to them live on air. In fact, that's what we're gonna
6422920	6435280	do right now. Dark Soccer, take it away. Alpha Cananagram must have been bored. We got an
6435280	6444080	email with the title, You Suck. And then the inside it says, I love Puyo Puyo Wee. Is Puyo
6444080	6450640	Puyo on the Wee? No. Wee. When you refer to yourself and other people. I know, I get it.
6450640	6455760	And then from MesoSky we have, Hey, I have been noticing that the majority of MMORPGs
6455760	6461040	are either science fiction or medieval fantasy. Do you ever think we will see MMORPGs that
6461040	6466600	are westerns, 1980s, or even modern era? Dude, we have. There was Matrix. Do you think that
6466600	6470520	people are attracted- That's sort of sci-fi. Yeah, that is more sci-fi, but we're in a
6470520	6476000	modern environment. Do you think people are attracted to an MMORPG that has been done
6476000	6485680	countless times before? There actually are pirate based MMOs. Puzzle Pirates. No, there
6485680	6492560	actually was one that I played a little bit of at PAX last year. Where you could play
6492560	6501240	a pirate and rape the booty. Um, what about, did they mention Star Trek has an MMO coming
6501240	6506000	out? That's Ace or Eve. Oh, it's science fiction. Yeah, science fiction or medieval
6506000	6511380	fantasy. Something else outside the box. Anything western? Disney has a couple MMOs out there
6511380	6517440	based on their products, but they're a little- You know Disney stars are genetically engineered
6517440	6521980	in a lab, right? Isn't there a Pirates of the Caribbean? Yeah, there is. But the thing
6521980	6526980	about those games, you can't type text in them. You have pre-determined phrases that
6526980	6530800	you can say because obviously they have to keep it family safe. So you don't have mean
6530800	6534960	people in there typing fuck shit piss cock unless that is a pre-selected phrase. They
6534960	6539440	also have all the adult MMOs. That's true, you can always try to find an adult MMO. Well,
6539440	6543800	like the Red Light District one? You're gonna have to face it, the fantasy and sci-fi ones
6543800	6550280	are by far the most popular, at least right now. Yep. Last one, and it comes from Marin.
6550280	6556160	Okay, ready? It's long. Hey guys, I didn't get to call in, but I wanted to touch on two
6556160	6561000	subjects that were discussed during last week's episode. First Rob mentioned that some people
6561000	6565200	are complaining about how DJ Hero is just a rip-off of Beatmania 2DX. I believe that
6565200	6569280	Rob protested the idea, saying they're completely different. I'd like to think it's something
6569280	6574680	like this. DJ Hero is to Beatmania 2DX as Guitar Hero is to Guitar Freaks. You could
6574680	6581560	very well say that these two games, Beatmania and Guitar Freaks, are the original music
6581560	6586480	games and that games like DJ and Guitar Hero are knock-offs, but I think it's more than
6586480	6591920	that. Konami music games have never been widely popular except in their own small niches and
6591920	6596140	followings. I think we're fortunate that game development companies like Harmonix are able
6596140	6601680	to see the potential of these music games and find ways to Americanize them because
6601680	6606640	it makes these games more accessible and likable to US customers. I know about a dozen people
6606640	6611080	who play or have played Guitar Freaks, but I only have one friend who hasn't played Guitar
6611080	6616320	Hero or Rock Band. Perhaps DJ Hero is similar to Beatmania 2DX, but it will definitely be
6616320	6621080	something that is more accessible to a Western audience. I for one am happy that DJ Hero
6621080	6626320	is joining the ranks of other music games like Guitar Hero and Rock Band because the
6626320	6631060	success of DJ Hero will only bring us that much closer to having an Americanized keyboard
6631060	6634680	mania game and I personally will be the first person to stand in line to pre-order Piano
6634680	6641240	Hero Elton John. Yes. Who's surprised? I would say, well I was going to say the better comparison
6641240	6648720	I think would be Guitar Freaks and Guitar Hero and then probably Beatmania and Kraken
6648720	6656400	DJ. Because, you know, Kraken DJ, it's kind of a beat matching game, but it's very different
6656400	6661680	than Beatmania. Well, I have my own thoughts, but let me wait until the email is done. Well,
6661680	6666200	also I did just get a note in saying that AlphaKananagram says that wasn't him, but
6666200	6676440	an imposter. Whatever. Whatever. Okay. Honestly, I don't really care. I thought it was funny.
6676440	6682120	Finally, I just wanted to touch on the idea of the new PS3 remote. To make a long story
6682120	6685780	short, the idea of the PS3 remote makes me think of the Super Scope 6, a pretty nifty
6685780	6690960	idea in theory, complete fail and execution. Take care and have fun gaming, Marin. PS Dark
6690960	6694360	Soccer, if you come to Las Vegas from July 1st through 7th, I will give you a dollar.
6694360	6699840	Hey, guess what? I'm going to Las Vegas from July 1st through the 7th. You win a dollar.
6699840	6704400	Congrats. How about buy me a soda? You should put that dollar in a slot machine and win
6704400	6708240	a hundred. Alright. I don't gamble. I'm going to play bimball. I agree with some of the
6708240	6712160	email and I disagree with some of it. I agree with the fact that Harmonix has done great
6712160	6715780	things for music games over here. Let's not forget they did create the original Guitar
6715780	6721340	Hero as well as Rock Band. Harmonix rocks and I don't, you know, they did what Konami
6721340	6725780	was too pussy to do basically and for that they deserve to be commended and get praised
6725780	6732980	lavished upon them. So thank you. From a music game fan like myself, you have to understand.
6732980	6737140	There you go. However, the part I disagree with is the comparison about DJ Hero and the
6737140	6742820	Guitar Freaks, Guitar Hero thing. I get that and I think we're, here's the thing. I bet
6742820	6746660	that's the same thing we're going to hear on G4 and for a lot of these networks and
6746660	6753220	stuff, but I don't think it's a real good comparison. Like, I would use the Guitar Hero,
6753220	6757580	Guitar Freaks comparison in trying to describe like DDR and In the Groove maybe a little
6757580	6763700	bit. Although, you know, both games were, you know, guitars where you held down buttons
6763700	6768340	and strummed the thing in time with it. The thing that's different for me is that that's
6768340	6772620	not really what's happening with DJ Hero is that because you not only have the buttons,
6772620	6777620	but you have the scratching and the crossfader is really big as well. And it's different
6777620	6782700	than it is in 2DX because the whole crossfading leads to a style of gameplay that to me looks
6782700	6788780	more like amplitude in a way. 2DX is more, yeah like where the scratching was just a
6788780	6795620	replacement of another button basically. Yeah, exactly. And for me, 2DX just feels like it's
6795620	6800180	just DDR but using buttons instead of your feet, which is ironic because BeatMania came
6800180	6804820	before DDR, but that's really what it is. Like it's just, it's another way of reading
6804820	6812340	music in a way. I think a better comparison would be to say Street Fighter 2 vs Tekken.
6812340	6817500	They're both fighting games, but they're completely different characters. Yeah, exactly. That's
6817500	6821380	what I'm saying is that DJ Hero and BeatMania 2DX, they're both music games, they both involve
6821380	6825060	turntables. Well, they're really different. And then also, you know, they're just like
6825060	6829300	Kraken DJ, ooh. When games started coming out and stuff, more fighting games, everyone
6829300	6832500	was like, oh, it's a Street Fighter ripoff. And I think we're gonna kinda go through this
6832500	6836020	phase right now with Guitar Hero and these music games because everyone's gonna say,
6836020	6840700	oh, it's a ripoff. But really, it's just another music game. But, I mean, we got into it elsewhere
6840700	6844340	on the show though as well is that, you know, now they're charging a premium price for it
6844340	6849060	and I think that's gonna be a little bit damaging. Let's also not forget though, one thing that
6849060	6852900	is interesting is that DJ Hero is not being made by Harmonix. Something to kinda keep
6852900	6858260	in mind. Harmonix is not making DJ Hero. But that's kinda cool that other developers now,
6858260	6862300	it's not just Harmonix has to make all our music games. But they, yeah, the other developer,
6862300	6868500	you know, is the one that did, you know, was B-Boy. They did that game, which is another
6868500	6873720	sort of music rhythm game with dancing involved and stuff like that. But they kinda have that
6873720	6878980	whole style that they, you know, kinda brought with them and stuff and their influences with
6878980	6882780	that. I don't know, I think it looks cool. I'm willing to check it out. I think you might
6882780	6891340	have missed a point too is that she wasn't saying that, um, that DJ Hero is like 2DX.
6891340	6898120	It pertains to 2DX in the way that Guitar Hero pertained to Guitar Freaks. Not that
6898120	6905700	they're the same type, not that they're the same type of game, but it's, they're different.
6905700	6913540	It's the Americanized, improved version, basically. It's tailored to a different audience. And
6913540	6920420	newer. I can see that to a point, it's just so different than it felt when we were talking
6920420	6923580	about Guitar Hero or Guitar Freaks. Because I think when a lot of us looked at Guitar
6923580	6927700	Hero the first time, a lot of us jumped to that whole, oh, it's Guitar Freaks. But now
6927700	6933780	that we're seeing, like, DJ Hero, I don't know, I don't see 2DX at all. It's just that
6933780	6941300	the basic influence is there. Okay. I could go with that. But I would say it's fair to
6941300	6947780	say that it also gets its influence from Guitar Hero, clearly. You know? So I think it gets
6947780	6951380	its influence from a lot of different music games. But anyway, I don't know, I think we
6951380	6956220	might be getting outside of the realm that Emo was trying to say. However, I do agree
6956220	6959980	with the point that it's a great thing that we are getting new music games in the first
6959980	6964820	place. And all it took was somebody taking that risk. Showing that Guitar Hero, a game
6964820	6972260	like that, would be popular in the first place. So there you go. So does that do it for the
6972260	6978300	mailbag? That be it, sir. Arr. Alright. If you want to send us more emails, mailbag at
6978300	6982620	OrangeLoungeRadio.com is the place to send your emails. We do have a segment here where
6982620	6986740	we read those. Also, we do some interactive stuff through our Twitter. So if you don't
6986740	6990740	have us at it on Twitter yet, you should do that at Twitter.com slash O-L-R. We're going
6990740	6994580	to get back into some long discussion topics. And we also have tonight's list-less coming
6994580	7002540	up. But let's do some discussion first. So Loki, start us off. Of course. So of course
7002540	7007580	we know the new trend now with expanding these consoles is kind of reinventing the interface
7007580	7011700	and adding new features and stuff. One thing that seems to be very popular, though, is
7011700	7021060	web to TV streaming. And with Netflix on the Xbox 360 plus Microsoft's own video service,
7021060	7028220	same thing with the PlayStation Network where you can stream movies as well. Actually, apparently
7028220	7035220	Instat, a marketing analysis group, published a report this week basically examining how
7035220	7043140	this web to TV streaming is consumed by people out there. And they found that the majority
7043140	7049220	of it is coming actually from console owners. They said 29% of U.S. console owners between
7049220	7055900	the ages of 25 and 34 currently use their consoles to stream video to their televisions.
7055900	7065580	And yeah, I can see that. I use it for streaming video and files and stuff like that. Plus
7065580	7071100	I've also downloaded TV episodes and stuff like that on there. So it is popular. It's
7071100	7076180	convenient. Here's my question. What's the competition besides game consoles? Apple TV?
7076180	7080020	Are they comparing it to Apple TV? Or are they comparing it to these Netflix boxes that
7080020	7086020	you can buy that are just stand-alone like Netflix devices that I've heard of? Digital
7086020	7092340	media adapters, set-top boxes like Apple TV, Blu-ray players, web-connected HD TVs, and
7092340	7098500	I guess media center PCs. That's odd that they throw Blu-ray players into that. What?
7098500	7103340	I guess web-enabled stuff. Maybe they're talking about like, you know how you can get those
7103340	7109380	bonuses on. Oh yeah, like you can go into the BD Live and get all the user commentary
7109380	7113220	and all that stuff. I can't figure out. That's too complicated for a normal person to use.
7113220	7117660	I'm sorry. But that BD Live stuff with doing all the custom commentary stuff, too complicated.
7117660	7122580	If they want people to actually use that, they need to make it easier to figure out
7122580	7125180	how to use that stuff. Because as it is, I was trying to figure out how to do that. And
7125180	7130820	you have to like go onto this website, put in your serial number, record a commentary.
7130820	7134240	Then it would be available on the BD Live, but it's only available to the people you
7134240	7138820	put on your friends list that have you on their friends list. And it's not even one
7138820	7143220	universal system. It's by company. So like universal Blu-ray has their own thing. Warner
7143220	7146380	Brothers Blu-ray has their own thing. Stupid. It's a mess. Stupid, stupid, stupid. It's
7146380	7150940	a big hot effing mess. They need to standardize it if they want people to use that stuff.
7150940	7155260	So I'll tell you right there, that's why Blu-ray is losing that web stuff. Because
7155260	7159480	there are some pretty neat things being done with Blu-ray. Like I randomly bought the WALL-E
7159480	7163780	Blu-ray and there's this mode on there. It's like a giant couch basically. And everybody's
7163780	7168500	watching WALL-E at the same time. So like you join this giant chat room basically if
7168500	7173900	people are watching WALL-E. But it's not really a chat room. They don't show messages
7173900	7177180	or anything like that. Because you know somebody would just be on there typing penis, penis,
7177180	7181380	penis the whole time. But what they do, they do these weird like polls. Like a little thing
7181380	7186220	will pop up on the screen like press this button if you saw WALL-E in the theater. Press
7186220	7189740	this button if you didn't see it until it came out on Blu-ray or whatever. And like
7189740	7193460	people vote and it shows you the results. These weird little interactive things that
7193460	7199180	I think just need some time to be good. It's neat. I kind of looked at it going, that's
7199180	7202700	kind of a neat feature. I wish they could do something more useful with it. Well here's
7202700	7206860	what I think would be pretty cool is you know how with Blu-ray and stuff you can do full
7206860	7213420	Java programming with it. Interactive like board games or like you know TV show things
7213420	7216440	like that. Trivia games I think would be pretty cool because you could actually program that
7216440	7220940	stuff in there. And you know how before with like a DVD you'd have like some sort of crazy
7220940	7225260	menu system and paths and stuff that would go for that. You can actually program a pretty
7225260	7230820	decent game. TigerKlonChat says the BD Live stuff is cool. My only gripe is the video
7230820	7236260	extras they offer aren't full screen. I see I've yet to even really figure out how to
7236260	7243860	get the video extras or I don't know what, oops, I don't know what DVD, what, sorry I
7243860	7248780	got distracted with chat stuff. I don't know what Blu-rays even have the extras. Maybe
7248780	7252180	I don't know anything about it. Well the problem is I think with the BD Live stuff is you're
7252180	7256940	talking about a Blu-ray player you know trying to stream that content. That Blu-ray player
7256940	7262180	I mean it's got something to decode you know obviously the data that's on the disk but
7262180	7266060	it's not a strong processor. You're not going to be able to compare it to like a PC or something
7266060	7269940	where you can just download stuff. And so obviously because of bandwidth issues I mean
7269940	7274220	who knows what people, what kind of bandwidth people are on so you got to make it really
7274220	7279540	small in order to you know kind of do that extra stuff. I love the idea of recording
7279540	7282900	your own commentary to go with movies because I would totally, you know there would be so
7282900	7287380	many people that would MST3K that and Rocky Horror Picture Show that stuff but I want
7287380	7291240	it to be available like for anybody to go on and access. I don't want to have to like
7291240	7294820	add friends and stuff. I really wish they'd centralized that stuff because I love the
7294820	7299000	idea I would totally do it. They do. Rift Tracks. Rift Tracks has. That's not built into
7299000	7306860	a Blu-ray player. I know. They should. They should. It would be awesome. And I'm being
7306860	7312420	told the Transformers Blu-ray has new BD Live content featuring footage from the new Transformers
7312420	7316940	movie plus some deleted scenes from the first one that just went released this week. Well
7316940	7321580	that would explain why I don't have it because I don't have the Transformers Blu-ray. I thought
7321580	7329140	about that. I got it on HD. Ah. There you go. We all got screwed for that so there you
7329140	7333180	go. Sg100Matt makes an interesting comment in chat. I'm buying a Blu-ray player for my
7333180	7336900	dad for his birthday this week. I really don't see why he would want any of this besides
7336900	7341900	I don't feel like showing him how to use it. You know honestly I'm a Blu-ray player or
7341900	7347700	a PS3. I don't use any of this extra content. In fact I couldn't care less about like these
7347700	7351820	interactive things where I can go on and chat with the producers and stuff. Who cares? It's
7351820	7356700	a damn DVD. If I want to chat with producers and stuff I'll go on the internet. Ah. It's
7356700	7362620	a Blu-ray. Blu-ray DVD or whatever. It doesn't matter. It's just I'm looking for basically
7362620	7368380	the same content that's on a DVD but maybe in a higher resolution or added more content
7368380	7373100	added on there instead of having to have four discs or something like that. You know just
7373100	7379820	all in one disc. Would be nice. Back to the original part of the story. The whole Netflix
7379820	7389500	thing. What is the I guess central part of this? I mean are they trying to say that this
7389500	7395460	is just showing that game devices are actually becoming entertainment hubs and all these
7395460	7401580	other types of things that will only do entertainment or being rejected? I think they're surprised
7401580	7407420	that you know for something that's you know streaming from the web that the consoles you
7407420	7414500	know I guess they're saying basically that you know video the television streaming is
7414500	7418980	putting pressure on traditional cable providers and will eventually restructure today's video
7418980	7424420	distribution ecosystem. They're saying that game consoles are at the forefront of this
7424420	7429260	new direction. So basically they're saying you know eventually everything's gonna go
7429260	7433980	the kind of you know digital streaming you know that physical media is gonna go away
7433980	7440240	or at least that's what they're claiming and that leading the way of this transition is
7440240	7448460	game consoles. That sounds pretty cool. I'm looking at some comments from chat. Tigerclaw
7448460	7453700	talks about the particular Blu-ray player he has. I have a Sony BDP-S350 which supports
7453700	7457500	BD Live. The BD Live only works on it as long as you have a USB thumb drive connected on
7457500	7461980	the back. I wonder how many people would even think to do that you know. There's so many
7461980	7465740	people that just need it to work right out of the box. The Rob D says I don't know when
7465740	7469420	the last time I listened to a director commentary was but Tigerclaw follows that up with I love
7469420	7474100	listening to directors commentary so I guess it really depends on the person. So kind of
7474100	7482500	interesting. Yeah. SSG100Matt closes this thought. It's a gimmick is what it is. Interesting
7482500	7486780	story on Netflix kind of turned into this whole Blu-ray discussion but I think that
7486780	7490620	Blu-ray thing is something that will continue to evolve. I think the smart thing that has
7490620	7496660	been built into it is funny. It's something I was critical of Sony on earlier. I was critical
7496660	7503980	on Sony about this and that is that Sony does not manage to evolve usually and that's why
7503980	7509660	Microsoft's beating them but now it appears they are evolving and where it comes to Blu-ray.
7509660	7515540	For more updates. That's where it comes down to. So now you can create a new feature and
7515540	7522140	everybody can now have that feature. Alright well let's move on to another topic and talk
7522140	7527540	a little bit about something else is going on a PlayStation 3 right now. It was a hamster
7527540	7533340	versus human dance off in PlayStation home. Yes you heard me right this Saturday this
7533340	7538900	past Saturday there was a hamsters versus humans dance off that happened. I just want
7538900	7546180	to point out it's not April 1st. It is the middle of June and I don't know what the hell
7546180	7552340	this was for although apparently like the winning faction would determine what type
7552340	7559260	of free gear everybody in home would get. So apparently like the fedoras and aviators
7559260	7564260	would be one if the humans won and if the hamsters won Viking and Valkyrie helmets would
7564260	7569900	have been given. Now joystick posters. Sorry I was very loud I apologize for that. But
7569900	7575420	I'm just watching this mass orgy of people dancing and some of them look like furries
7575420	7581540	because they're hamsters. I think the most important information that we got out of this
7581540	7586740	is that there's hamster costumes in home and that's scary now because now there's furries
7586740	7593100	in home. Well I think my initial reaction when I watched this video and kind of everything
7593100	7600100	that's going on here is what the fucking fuck is this fucking bull fuck fuck. I mean really
7600100	7605740	what is this. Is this that what we imagine PlayStation home was going to be when they
7605740	7611820	unveiled it at gamer developers conference last year. I mean is this the innovation that
7611820	7616980	they were looking forward to do in home. Really. This is just Second Life. OK this is the kind
7616980	7622240	of crap that happens in Second Life. It's not that I have a problem with the stupidity
7622240	7628980	of the whole thing but it was on the official Sony PlayStation blog and I'm just kind of
7628980	7633940	like really. These are the events I have to look forward to in home. What is the fucking
7633940	7644540	point. Really. Home being used to broadcast the Sony PlayStation conference during E3.
7644540	7649740	That was a great use of home. That was smart. That was cool. And having everybody in that
7649740	7655500	place they could view it hamsters versus humans. And it doesn't look like there was a good
7655500	7662900	turnout for that either. I mean it's just like maybe 50 people. Well I apparently was
7662900	7667740	server by server too. Oh a lot of people. You know what though. You log into home there's
7667740	7671460	a lot of people using it. I just don't know what they're doing. I have yet to figure that
7671460	7676580	out. Wait waiting in lines for a game. I guess there are some why you have to wait in line
7676580	7682260	to play a game. It's a fucking virtual world. You can play the game whenever the hell you
7682260	7687580	want. Why do I have to wait in line to play a virtual game. That's stupid. Because it's
7687580	7691300	more like real life I guess. Tiger Claw says home is also being used for Q&A's with the
7691300	7698780	directors and stars of big movies. Alright that's neat I guess. A little unnecessary
7698780	7702540	but I guess they do it in Second Life too. It's a little something more special than
7702540	7706100	a chat room because you can actually see the director or the special person in front of
7706100	7713500	you. And do the running man as a hamster. Or guinea pig or whatever the hell. Yeah.
7713500	7719380	S2100 Matt says why couldn't Jack Trenton talk about this lol. My gosh. Hey this is
7719380	7726020	Sony's best kept secret. No not really. Some folks say Rob D says waiting in line immerses
7726020	7730300	you in the virtual world. It adds a new level of realism. Zappi says waiting in lines is
7730300	7734700	very social. You know I don't know. Well I don't know. It's hard for me to say because
7734700	7737820	I don't know what types of things people say on home really. I don't pay attention to a
7737820	7742420	lot of the dialogue. But I can't imagine people are going to be as cordial online as they
7742420	7746340	are in real life. Like when you're standing in line at Disneyland maybe you'll strike
7746340	7750200	up conversation with people around you. Maybe. I don't know. I usually don't because I strike
7750200	7753800	up conversation with the people that are with me. But okay we are being social because I'm
7753800	7758260	with people. But A in home you don't really have that. You know everybody goes to home
7758260	7762260	by themselves. And B when people can hide behind their monitors they do stupid shit
7762260	7767180	that they wouldn't do in real life. So I don't think people would say hurry the fuck up at
7767180	7773780	Disneyland as much as they would say you know in Sony home. I don't know. I say hurry the
7773780	7778940	fuck up all the time at Disneyland. Yeah but you're not really saying it to a child. Well
7778940	7783300	maybe you are. I don't know. But yeah I just. What I want to tell some of the parents there
7783300	7788220	is to watch your fucking children maybe. I don't know. Just when I saw this whole thing
7788220	7791540	you know granted if I don't like it I just shouldn't play it. But I'm just looking at
7791540	7796500	this going really. Really this is what home has become. I can understand if it was like
7796500	7801100	some sort of thing that like bloggers or whatever decided hey let's do this. This is funny.
7801100	7804740	I wouldn't have even reported on it. Yeah. In that case but it was on the official PlayStation
7804740	7810380	blog. And I'm like and with a with a little poster markup and everything. And I don't
7810380	7815700	know if that's kind of like just giving in or conceding to what home has become. But
7815700	7821500	if you want me to have this be I turn on my PlayStation and the first thing I see is home
7821500	7825980	and then I walk up to this if I want to launch a game or I have my trophy case and all this
7825980	7829580	stuff. I mean really. This is not the way to sell at me that this is ever going to be
7829580	7834260	a reality. Yeah well to launch or launch in the home and you know view your trophy case
7834260	7842260	coming 2010. It's just. It's on the horizon Rob. You have to understand that the new peer
7842260	7848020	use of home. It's coming. Oh well it'll be there eventually. Don't worry. We'll have
7848020	7853940	a firm launch date that we won't stick to but it will come. I'm so sorry. How how could
7853940	7858780	I ever doubt Sony especially after the amazing hardware that was the PlayStation 2. How dare
7858780	7867040	I how dare I be skeptical. All I have to say is bring on the games. I'm kind of glad part
7867040	7870820	of me thinks if I'd seen this earlier I would have actually logged in to check it out and
7870820	7874540	then once I was there I would have been like what the hell am I doing with my life. You
7874540	7883900	know slash rest slash rest. But oh well they need PVP in home or just maybe a game somewhere
7883900	7889860	there I don't know. PVP PVP better. It would be cool if like I could actually walk up to
7889860	7894420	somebody and it was very easy to start a game but I don't know at the same time maybe finding
7894420	7899180	my friends list in a home would be a place to start like maybe a section of home that
7899180	7903460	only my friends list can access or friends of friends can access. I would love that like
7903460	7907700	a section where I only see friends and friends of friends and then can start up really easy
7907700	7915180	quick games with them. So that would be like an empty room with me and Bobby. Pretty much.
7915180	7920060	When you guys actually have your systems on. Yes that's what it would be. Alright anyhow
7920060	7923180	let's move on I know we got some more news we have list list coming up in just a little
7923180	7930620	bit but Dark Soccer's got one more story for us before we get into that. I do. Well as
7930620	7937420	a matter of fact I do. And this is actually something that I think is really really cool.
7937420	7943180	Namco Museum Essentials is coming to Playstation Home in July which looks like we'll be getting
7943180	7951180	Pac-Man, Galaga, Dig Dug, Dragon Spirit, Xevious and a 1080p quote re-envisioned Xevious Resurrection
7951180	7956940	which is pretty cool. So you get your trophies, leaderboards, blah blah blah. But it's more
7956940	7962060	Namco and that's always happy. But the important thing to note about this is it's in home.
7962060	7967740	Yeah it's in home. That's strange. Like so am I going to have to buy this is this home
7967740	7972340	going to be the only place I can play this Xevious re-imaging? I doubt it for very long.
7972340	7976180	So you buy the game and then you have to wait in line to play your own game that you just
7976180	7981920	bought? Surely it can't be like that. Maybe it goes in your own house. That would make
7981920	7986400	sense if you buy this game and it goes in the house you own. Can other friends play
7986400	7990860	it? Or is it going to be so? You can invite friends in your home can't you? Yeah. But
7990860	7995820	it's just so it's like honestly I have to be honest. I don't really know how to do that.
7995820	8001780	Like one thing Sony could do is make this whole thing easier. You know what I mean?
8001780	8008180	Yeah. Like okay Facebook bejeweled. Tons of people play bejeweled on Facebook right? I
8008180	8012020	don't know about your friends, but my friends, tons of people play. You know why they all
8012020	8017540	play? Because when one person plays and they get a good score they click a button and it
8017540	8022620	publishes to their profile. I'm playing this game. Come play with me by clicking here.
8022620	8028580	That's how easy it is. If they want home to be like this central place that everybody
8028580	8033020	it needs to be that easy. And I'm sure I have listeners that are like Rob all you have to
8033020	8037180	do is open up the menu. I'm like no no no. You're not hearing what I'm saying. It needs
8037180	8045740	to be easier than that. If you want more than just the real hardcore gamers to be in on
8045740	8051820	this. It needs to be like Xbox 360 where I click the you know the guide button. Go to
8051820	8057900	my friend and say invite them to game. Or invite them to my home or invite them into
8057900	8062420	my house. Invite to house to see what's up. Exactly. Exactly right. That's exactly what
8062420	8067180	needs to happen. So I don't know though as far as the Namco thing goes I guess that's
8067180	8071820	pretty cool. But I guess this could be the start of where we really start to see now
8071820	8079920	maybe the full intention of home. If you want to call it that. I don't know. The cash in
8079920	8088260	on stuff. Sounds good to me. I guess. I'll check it out for sure. I mean hey homes free.
8088260	8092780	So despite all the crap I give it. It's free. It's hard to bitch about something that's
8092780	8096860	free I found a way to do it anyway. But if I go in there and some of these games are
8096860	8100580	available for free I'll check it out. If I have to pay for some of them I don't know
8100580	8105140	because you know these Namco games. I'm sorry but how many freaking times do these games
8105140	8109140	come out on how many different systems at this point. Like I'm not paying for Pac-Man
8109140	8114740	again. I don't know. I think this would be kind of cool. Given some of the things we
8114740	8120060	know about this collection. Is this is the same thing I think it is. I don't know. Yeah
8120060	8124780	I don't know if it is. I don't know. May I mean there might be some cool stuff but we'll
8124780	8129620	see. And hopefully you know the Xevious thing does sound cool. I'll give it that. The Xevious
8129620	8132780	thing sounds pretty cool. I want to check it out. I really want to play it. Actually
8132780	8138200	I really really want to play it because I love Xevious. Actdeft in our chatroom points
8138200	8145540	out Yaris was free too and we all know how that turned out. So there you go. Marin in
8145540	8150340	chat makes a very good point. Home in real life is where you're lazy. Home for Playstation
8150340	8157560	3 should be lazy friendly too. Exactly my point. And RPGKing7 says it has to be stupid
8157560	8163820	friendly. It does. It does. You know if we want our parents and you know some of our
8163820	8169460	friends who aren't as into gaming. You know you all know this. You all have a friend who
8169460	8173860	thinks video games are kind of fun but doesn't really play an awful lot of them. But they
8173860	8177940	might own a next gen system that they you know play Madden or a role playing game on
8177940	8180940	one spot. You know what. They wouldn't know how to use a lot of this stuff. They need
8180940	8186900	to take I think examples. What they need to do is kind of learn from MMOs and what people
8186900	8192220	do in their downtime of MMOs. I think home should add fishing because there's plenty
8192220	8196900	of fishing going on in Final Fantasy 11. And you know what. That's something you can do
8196900	8202900	by yourself and just kick back. Actually what about something like item synthesis or professions.
8202900	8207380	I know it sounds stupid but imagine if you could like make your own shirts and things.
8207380	8210040	Within reason like I'm not saying put your own designs on it because everybody will walk
8210040	8214940	around with a shirt saying fuck or topless mods such as pictures of boobs and things
8214940	8220500	like that. But I'm saying like you know people could collect items in home and then build
8220500	8227420	stuff. And then maybe even like sell them for fake money. I don't know. But then I'm
8227420	8232580	turning home into an MMO and I guess that's not his intention. But all right. Let's move
8232580	8237800	on to another topic and we're going to get into some listless for tonight. And I'm excited
8237800	8241980	because we haven't done listless in a long time here on the show. And I need to find
8241980	8246340	the music though. Shame on me. I didn't have the music queued up already. We have music
8246340	8253340	that goes with listless. And it's a remake of a familiar tune. There we go. The music
8253340	8257940	for listless. All right. The way listless works folks if you've never heard this segment
8257940	8261500	before on Orange Lounge Radio we've been doing it ever since the very beginning because this
8261500	8265620	is a segment I used to do on my college radio show. So it gives you an idea like how old
8265620	8269580	this is. All right. So here it is. We're going to take a topic and then we are each here
8269580	8274060	in studio going to give our top four for that topic. Yes we've changed things up a little
8274060	8277860	bit since the last time we've done this. We're all going to give our top four for the topic.
8277860	8282980	And then we will have made a list of 12 between the list of four that both Dark Soccer and
8282980	8287820	looking myself make. Then we will each go around and take one item off of the list leaving
8287820	8293640	us with a list of nine. Then you guys in chat will vote on the nine. Your favorite. And
8293640	8297380	you give us your number one and number two votes. And then we should have a definitive
8297380	8303980	list for our topic tonight. So this is how we build definitive lists of answers. Tonight's
8303980	8310260	topic we are stealing from Kotaku. Openly admitting it we are thieving this from Kotaku
8310260	8314620	but they had a pretty interesting idea for E3 this whole chain interview thing. Well
8314620	8318180	Reggie Fils-Aime was the last guy they interviewed and they asked him a question that someone
8318180	8321700	had asked before and then they said well Reggie you're at the end of the chain why don't you
8321700	8326940	ask something for all our readers. And Reggie Fils-Aime asked well in the same vein of Team
8326940	8331580	Ninja working with Nintendo to reimagine Metroid what development group would your readers
8331580	8339300	love to see partner and collaborate with Nintendo and on what franchise. So you know let's face
8339300	8344020	it Metroid Other M was probably the big big announcement out of Nintendo for us hardcore
8344020	8350020	gamers. OMG Team Ninja working with Nintendo who would have thought. So what do you think
8350020	8356740	could be the next OMG developer working with a Nintendo franchise. That's where we are
8356740	8360220	here to put the list together tonight. So let's start putting that list together. Loki
8360220	8365700	why don't you start us off this week. Give us your number four answer. Number four answer
8365700	8374700	let me see. Well this is kind of a joke answer so we're going to go with that. Akira Yamaoka
8374700	8381820	and Luigi's Mansion. Akira Yamaoka is going so Team Silent or just Akira Yamaoka. Team
8381820	8385740	Silent. Team Silent is going to remake Luigi's Mansion that's pretty awesome. How would that
8385740	8394500	work. It would be extremely intense but with Luigi. So would Pyramid Head make an appearance
8394500	8402740	in this. Less whimsical and more scary I guess. Alright fair enough. Let's see my answer would
8402740	8409940	be my number four answer tonight. Blizzard the folks behind World of Warcraft right Blizzard
8409940	8416580	would make an Animal Crossing game. So now Animal Crossing really would be an MMO. So
8416580	8424220	Blizzard makes an Animal Crossing game. Alright so Dark Sakura what is your number four pick
8424220	8430860	and why. God mine's actually kind of related to that the Sims team doing a new Animal Crossing.
8430860	8438860	And actually you know make it interesting. Nice we both had Animal Crossing answers back
8438860	8443820	to back. The Rob D's chat say no Blizzard should make the Pikmin game. I've also heard
8443820	8447580	of Pokemon MMO. Well we'll see maybe they'll come up on someone else's list. Alright so
8447580	8451260	we have Team Silent, Luigi's Mansion, Blizzard doing Animal Crossing and Sims doing Animal
8451260	8455460	Crossing. Interesting we're only part way in and already two similar answers. Let's
8455460	8461700	see if we have more of that. Loki your number three answer. This is kind of weird but let's
8461700	8471940	see here. Suda 51 or Grasshopper Manufacture and Wario Land. And you know Suda 51 is the
8471940	8479660	you know the mind behind Killer7 and No More Heroes and just like the insane crazy shit
8479660	8484140	that's in those games. Put that in Wario Land because you know Warioware stuff's really
8484140	8494380	crazy so it'd just be batshit crazy just the platformer. That is insane. That is just pure
8494380	8501740	insanity. Alright fair enough. This next one I'm gonna say is my number three pick and
8501740	8506060	I picked just I kind of randomly picked Capcom but I think because they've made a lot of
8506060	8511300	good like great especially back in the 8-bit days platformer games and side scrolling games.
8511300	8515780	So that's why I say Capcom should make a new Kid Icarus game. So they should give us the
8515780	8519940	Kid Icarus game that many fanboys have been wanting for quite some time so there you go
8519940	8525740	my number three answer Capcom makes a new Kid Icarus game. Dark Soccer your number three.
8525740	8534860	My number three is the Outrun team doing the next Cruisin and making that a good game.
8534860	8540540	I haven't thought of Cruisin for a very long time. I thought Cruisin was Midway. Is it?
8540540	8547700	I was saying but didn't they know that was with Nintendo and Rare. Yeah I think Rare
8547700	8551380	had something to do with it. Whatever. So fair enough. You know what we'll let it slide
8551380	8555060	it doesn't even matter. So Outrun team makes Cruisin and brings that series back. It certainly
8555060	8564420	has memories on Nintendo 64 and all that so there you go. Let's see Loki we're halfway
8564420	8572060	through what would you say? Let's see if I should start doing some of my serious ones
8572060	8579020	here. The chat room is clarifying by the way it was Midway made it but for Nintendo so
8579020	8585660	it was really a Nintendo franchise that Midway made. Looks like I hope I don't mispronounce
8585660	8595780	this. Kaita Takahashi and Yoshi's Island. That would be hilarious. And Kaita Takahashi
8595780	8603500	the creator of Katamari Damacy and Yoshi's Island. What would this game be like? Touch
8603500	8619820	Fuzzy Get Dizzy? Yes the entire game would be Touch Fuzzy Get Dizzy. Nice. Alright let's
8619820	8636180	see what we got here. I think Q Entertainment should just give us a new Tetris infused with
8636180	8646700	all the music and lights and hypnotic stuff. That's what I want. Sorry for the silence
8646700	8652580	I'm actually typing out a list here as we go. Dark Sakura your number two answer please.
8652580	8658340	The Silent Hill team doing Luigi's Mansion. I thought you did that. Oh my gosh you guys
8658340	8661940	both had the same one? Oh I didn't I thought you were talking about a different game. Oh
8661940	8669660	how funny. That's alright. No no no no I'll pick something different. The Silent Hill
8669660	8676860	no shoot. I can do another one if she wants to take mine I don't care. No cause I completely
8676860	8684580	missed it. Um okay how about the um. There's lots of good ideas in chat. Yeah but I don't
8684580	8695220	listen to them. Nice. Um actually okay how about um Square doing the next Zelda game.
8695220	8702420	Alright fair enough. Zelda's a beloved franchise but maybe it's time to turn it over and let
8702420	8706340	some other people who are more experienced out of it have a crack at it. Square makes
8706340	8710500	a Zelda game. Alright so far we have Team Silent makes Luigi's Mansion. Blizzard makes
8710500	8716220	Animal Crossing. Sims team makes Animal Crossing. Suda51 makes Wario Land. Capcom makes Kid
8716220	8721500	Icarus. Outrun team makes Cruisin. Keita Takahashi makes Yoshi's Island. Q Entertainment makes
8721500	8726740	Tetris. Square makes a Zelda game. Let's get into the number one answers. Loki your number
8726740	8731960	one answer please. I'm sorry Rob this is probably going to take yours but Criterion Games does
8731960	8740900	the next F-Zero cause Burnout is fucking awesome and it just lends itself perfectly to F-Zero.
8740900	8744780	Well you read my mind but Criterion Games was not who I actually thought of to take
8744780	8751900	over the F-Zero franchise. My number one answer is Sega, Namco, and Nintendo all team up again
8751900	8757120	and finally bring us a fucking sequel to F-Zero GX. And yes I phrased it just like that. So
8757120	8769580	Sega and Namco once again make F-Zero GX. That's two F-Zero GX's is his number one answer
8769580	8778380	so far. Let's see if Dark Sakura has the same answer or something new. Treasure doing a
8778380	8789380	new Kid Icarus. Could you imagine how hard that shit would be? That could be very interesting.
8789380	8796140	Some runner ups I had. Arc System Works and Smash Bros. Arc System Works of course the
8796140	8807500	Guilty Gear franchise. A 2D Smash Bros. game would be kind of cool. Bethesda and Zelda
8807500	8817940	and another one that just popped into my head. Kojima Productions and Battalion Wars. Nice.
8817940	8822260	No Earthbound I was almost going to say that Square should do the Earthbound game but I
8822260	8831820	don't know. Earthbound is very American and even though yes I realize. Square is very
8831820	8835060	Japanese centric I just don't think it would meld well. I was trying to think of the perfect
8835060	8841500	developer for that but I couldn't. So there you go. Alright well guess what guys here
8841500	8845100	it is the list. Now we got to go around and eliminate. This is going to be hard. Alright
8845100	8850740	so here it is so far. Team Silent makes Luigi's Mansion. Blizzard makes a new Animal Crossing
8850740	8857600	game. The Sims Team makes a new Animal Crossing game. Suda51 makes Wario Land. Capcom makes
8857600	8862900	Kid Icarus. Outrun Team makes Krusen. Keita Takahashi makes Yoshi's Island. Q Entertainment
8862900	8868100	makes Tetris. Square makes a Zelda game. Criterion Games makes F-Zero. Sega and Namco once again
8868100	8872580	make F-Zero. And Treasure makes Kid Icarus. Loki which one of these is not worthy of the
8872580	8879620	list? Outrun Team makes Krusen. Awwww. I'm sorry the last few Krusen games have really
8879620	8888660	sucked. But this would breed new life. I don't know about that. Alright. I am going to take
8888660	8896780	out Suda51 makes Wario Land. Too crazy. It's just too weird. I don't get it. Dark Sakura
8896780	8902420	which one of these is not worthy of the list? Blizzard doing Animal Crossing. You just want
8902420	8907740	yours to be the only Animal Crossing author. No honestly. Alright fair enough. Alright
8907740	8911220	so there you go. Three have been eliminated from the list leaving us with a list of nine
8911220	8915460	that the chat will now vote on. Here it is. We'll get to the answers a little later in
8915460	8920420	the show. Remember you need to be in our chat. Chat.orangelaunchradio.com and you can place
8920420	8927420	a private message to Rob Roberts in chat right now with your number one and number two answers.
8927420	8933060	So here we go. Team Silent makes Luigi's Mansion. The Sims Team makes a new Animal Crossing
8933060	8937860	game. Capcom makes Kid Icarus. Keita Takahashi makes Yoshi's Island. Q Entertainment makes
8937860	8942960	Tetris. Square makes a Zelda game. Criterion Games makes F-Zero. Sega and Namco once again
8942960	8948740	make F-Zero. Or Treasure makes Kid Icarus. So we have two F-Zeros and two Kid Icaruses
8948740	8952260	on there. So we'll see how that plays out. If they split the votes or what. So remember
8952260	8957000	you can place a vote now to Rob Roberts in the chat room with a private message and indicate
8957000	8960820	your number one and your number two or it will be assumed that your first answer is
8960820	8967500	your number one pick. While we tally that up, we're going to get into another segment
8967500	8973340	here. We like to call the F-Us of the week but in order for our angst to build, we have
8973340	8978520	to have a story that makes it worthy of us building the angst. And I also have to cue
8978520	8982500	the music which I was completely unprepared for tonight. I'm not used to this new format
8982500	8990220	yet where everything is in a different order in the show. Anyhow, let's see here. The inspiration
8990220	8994220	for this week's F-Us of the week is the downtime that Xbox Live recently had. You might remember
8994220	8998060	they were down all day Tuesday. Well guess what? When they came back up, it was not all
8998060	9003340	fixed. In fact, some of the games disappeared from Xbox Live Marketplace. Those in the Sega
9003340	9009960	Vintage Collection 2. Eh, no big loss I suppose. But the new purchases like Sam and Max and
9009960	9014060	Magic the Gathering that had just come out on Xbox Live, you couldn't download them.
9014060	9020420	Nor could you redeem codes including your pre-order codes for the Xbox 360 version of
9020420	9024860	Ghostbusters. So the PlayStation 3 users got to jump on that and look, all I'm going to
9024860	9030340	say is if you're going to take your system down for 24 hours, it should be working by
9030340	9034820	the time you bring it back up or don't bring it back up. So stories like this make us angry
9034820	9054620	so yeah, we're going to bring on the F-Us of the week.
9054620	9064780	My F-U of the week goes towards sleeping for 12 to 13 hours because I lost most of my day.
9064780	9073260	Ugh, my F-U goes to Xbox Live Marketplace because Angry Berry is still broken and I
9073260	9078620	still amount 400 Microsoft points and nobody seems to be fixing anything. Very convenient
9078620	9085180	Microsoft now that you have my money.
9085180	9090780	My F-U of the week goes to the fact that I just told people to vote for the wrong thing.
9090780	9094820	Sorry guys, yes in chat it's Rob Roberts not Sky. Look three people fixed it all in a row.
9094820	9100660	I'm broken and I don't know what it is. I guess I'm going to say F-U to the swine flu
9100660	9105180	for reals. I know there's been a lot of jokes and ha-has made about it but I actually have
9105180	9110820	a friend suffering from swine flu right now who's in the hospital in ICU and is really
9110820	9115660	not in good shape right now and a lot of us are actually kind of scared because she had
9115660	9118700	to get put on dialysis this morning. That's how bad it's gotten because her kidneys are
9118700	9125340	failing from all the meds. So yeah she contracted swine flu. I don't know where it came from
9125340	9130980	but Beth I am thinking of you and I really want you to get better soon. So let's go ahead
9130980	9134580	and move on to some more gaming news.
9134580	9139340	Yes. Well I tally the votes. My god there's tons of people voting tonight. Well of course
9139340	9144380	you would think with the Apple iPhone and the iPod touch you know it's a bit limited
9144380	9150000	on what you can do with games on there. So of course and this is actually being listed
9150000	9157100	as one of the features with the iPhone 3.0 firmware is that third party accessories are
9157100	9164340	going to now be available. And this is actually coming from you know the official iPod touch
9164340	9170120	software update page. And so people are thinking oh goody we're going to get controller add
9170120	9174460	ons. And so that might be actually what's going to happen because you know with gaming
9174460	9179500	being so popular nowadays and really those touch screen controls suck. I mean look at
9179500	9188220	Mega Man 2. They need a new alternative so it might actually be an add on. So what do
9188220	9191720	you think is that a good idea. Would you actually play with something like this. Sorry I'm like
9191720	9196100	tallying cage match votes right now so it's hard for me to totally pay attention but it
9196100	9204300	really I think would depend on how well executed it is honestly. They'd really have to do something
9204300	9211740	impressive. I don't know. I mean I think it's kind of I guess it's OK. I mean a lot of people
9211740	9216220	are kind of bitchy about you know oh I don't want to you know have some stupid peripheral
9216220	9221460	hanging off of my you know iPod to play a game but you know I guess you don't necessarily
9221460	9228780	need to buy it. And then some people are saying hey now they can do Guitar Hero on iPhone.
9228780	9238340	I hope not. That'd be scary. But I don't know. Well I mean the iPhone kind of needs something
9238340	9243120	like that if it's really going to be like the next wave in gaming or whatever. You know
9243120	9248900	I don't know how seriously Apple's taking gaming right now because I've heard about
9248900	9254620	this whole like premium games for the iPhone thing which I think is silly. The games that
9254620	9258640	are on there right now I don't see them getting much better than that. Why should I pay four
9258640	9261860	times as much especially when there's a lot of great indie games that are ninety nine
9261860	9272100	cents or free. You know what I mean. Yeah definitely. I don't know. So OK. I'm trying
9272100	9277780	to see if there's anything going on in chat right now. They're still talking about the
9277780	9281820	list list tonight a little bit which I'm still trying to tally up. The Rob D in chat though
9281820	9286740	says isn't the point of the iPhone 3 G.S. to be better for gaming. I don't think not
9286740	9292020	necessarily. How about to be a more efficient multimedia machine. That's what I think. Also
9292020	9295300	I'd be pretty ticked off if games started coming out that I couldn't play because I
9295300	9302300	didn't have a 3 G.S. I suppose that type of thing is inevitable but I wouldn't be happy.
9302300	9308980	Yeah. All right. Well I believe that brings us to the end of our topics tonight. So we're
9308980	9313380	going to go ahead and open up the Skype line at one eight seven seven game O.L.R. or a
9313380	9317260	username on Skype is Orange Launch Radio if you want to give us a call. If you have any
9317260	9320260	type of topic you want to bring up that we missed tonight one eight seven seven game
9320260	9324260	O.L.R. username on Skype is Orange Launch Radio. Meanwhile do we have any last minute
9324260	9329380	stories or missed rapid fires that we want to talk about. Yeah sure I've got some stuff
9329380	9333060	I can talk about. Apparently there's a rumor that Michael Jackson is involved with the
9333060	9343420	new video game and no word on exactly what that is yet. But apparently there's an action.
9343420	9349180	There's something that he's working on right now. No. Sega involved. I don't know this
9349180	9358060	is coming out of it's actually a foreign article nine lives B.E. is the Web site that has the
9358060	9364060	information on it. And you know it's kind of hard to determine what exactly they're
9364060	9367620	talking about. Let's go to the phones. We have a call. Hi you're on Orange Launch Radio.
9367620	9373340	Who's this. Hi it's Ron. What's up everyone. Hi Ron. Well how are you doing. Hey. God what
9373340	9378780	con did you go to this week. I didn't go to a con this week. I won't break for another
9378780	9382820	three weeks. Are you sitting. No I'm kidding. What's up. By the way this is the last call
9382820	9389380	for votes in our list list tonight. What what to what do we owe this phone call tonight.
9389380	9398820	I have gone through an official Xbox right of passage. How so. Red ring of death. Congratulations
9398820	9403940	I suppose I don't really know how to phrase that but how did it happen. Was it just randomly
9403940	9408780	in the middle of the game or what. What happened was this was watching videos and streaming
9408780	9413940	it off my computer and the machine kept locking up and I'm like that's not good. And then
9413940	9420500	I saw three red rings pop up last week and I'm like fuck I will deal with this when I
9420500	9425460	come back from anime next. And then Friday night I find if my roommate he turned it on
9425460	9433300	to play Guitar Hero all four rings went red. That sucks dude I'm sorry to hear it. It's
9433300	9438700	not so bad because I just got a new 360 today anyway. So what did you do you just went out
9438700	9443060	and bought a new machine. Did you even call Microsoft to fix the old one or what. No I
9443060	9448580	packed up back in the box with the best I showed my receipt and got a new one. I see
9448580	9453300	wait how long ago did you buy this Xbox 360 you had last year. Wow and they still took
9453300	9458860	it back. That's because I bought the two year replacement plan. Okay there you go. So you
9458860	9464100	actually bought that plan that I think you were wrecking you win or some of our listeners
9464100	9469280	were recommending people buy that stuff. And there you go you just got to cash in on it.
9469280	9475380	Only downside is that you know since the pro are now $2.99 I paid $3.49 I'm kind of like
9475380	9480940	I don't get a $50 credit coming towards me. But I do have a bigger hard drive. Yeah and
9480940	9487040	you've had your Xbox for the past year. So you know that's that's the price you pay for
9487040	9492460	having something early I suppose. Yeah and what was funny was that when I went to fire
9492460	9497820	it up it didn't even have the new Xbox experience so I had to download everything first. Oh
9497820	9502340	really that is kind of interesting. Either that I still have like one of the older consoles
9502340	9506060	or something. Perhaps but I don't think they're going to give you the top of the line ones
9506060	9511300	as a replacement. That's probably the hidden text so. Well I could have asked for a different
9511300	9518560	box if I wanted to but eh. Well what happened with it now is everything okay with like your
9518560	9522620	save files because like yesterday when I'm asking about that your save files purchases
9522620	9527900	you've made on Xbox live. Because I know when I got mine back a couple of my games the two
9527900	9532300	arcade games I owned at the time because mine read ring to death after a week and when I
9532300	9537580	got it back this is back when they actually had the coffins when I got it back. It does
9537580	9541820	this weird thing now it's geometry wars whenever I go into geometry wars like you have to wait
9541820	9545980	a second and then suddenly you'll see oh playful version like it looks like you're launching
9545980	9549160	the trial and I know what it's doing it's communicating with the server and all that
9549160	9554660	stuff but you know. I haven't gone through that yet because I have a friend who has a
9554660	9559540	transfer kit so I borrowed his kit and I transferred all my files over from the old drive to the
9559540	9565580	new one. Oh because you get to keep your drive okay okay. Yeah it seems that when you with
9565580	9569220	Best Buy you know you you bring it in you hold on to the hard drive and they just give
9569220	9572540	you a brand new console. I guess but that's the same thing they do with Microsoft too
9572540	9575740	I never sent my hard drive back I think it's something to do about the actual serial on
9575740	9579660	the Xbox 360. I don't know I haven't played either of those games in a long time either
9579660	9582540	so they might have changed something because you know now there's geometry wars too and
9582540	9585700	I couldn't tell you the last time I signed on the Xbox live and played joust but I should
9585700	9591500	do that joust is awesome so. I should think about that but most of the time I'm just streaming
9591500	9595860	videos and stuff off my 360 from my computer because I don't like sitting here in front
9595860	9602980	of the 19 inch I'd rather watch it in glorious 32 inch. Amen to that. Yes. Size does matter.
9602980	9608540	Mm hmm. That's what she said. All right Rama anything else before we let you go tonight.
9608540	9613380	That's it. All right you take care buddy have a good one. All right. Later. Later. 877 Game
9613380	9617580	OLR Orange Lounge Radio on Skype. Listless results coming right up but a few more last
9617580	9621900	minute stories. Do we have any more? Yeah actually that one thing I was talking about
9621900	9626580	the Michael Jackson game he's supposed to be starring in his own game so no word on
9626580	9631060	exactly what that is but it's a game that he's actually going to be the lead in. Quick
9631060	9636340	question. Chat. Anyone interested in a Michael Jackson game. Would you buy it. Let's say
9636340	9641780	you did it. Let's say it's a music game. Hi you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this.
9641780	9647820	Welcome to Zaku. Hey Zaku what's on your mind. Nothing much. Just spending a rainy weekend
9647820	9652660	here in New York City and just trying to like hold on to dear life as usual. It's bright
9652660	9656860	and sunny out here in California although we did. Yeah that's because you barely get
9656860	9662220	any rain. We had some. You get more drought weather than we get up here. We're getting
9662220	9665900	like soaked this whole month. This is very true. By the way the chat is answering my
9665900	9672620	question and almost overwhelmingly I'm seeing if it's Moonwalker 2. Yes. Moonwalker 2. Michael
9672620	9675860	Jackson Moonwalker 2. Yes Michael Jackson Moonwalker 2. You might not have heard it
9675860	9680020	because you were calling in but I asked the chatters if Michael Jackson is really making
9680020	9683700	a video game and starring in it would you buy it. And the chatters are all saying. Will
9683700	9690580	that involve like you know Jesus Juice and other sexual accusations. Let's not go there.
9690580	9695740	Zaku what did you want to call in about tonight. All right. Basically I just wanted to bring
9695740	9700460	up a little gem that I managed to find this weekend apparently. I don't know if you heard
9700460	9706500	but this probably make a talk earlier today but apparently these developers were making
9706500	9711420	an iPhone Commodore 64 application. We did touch on it during rapid fire news and it
9711420	9717460	got shut down which stinks doesn't it. What do you think about it getting shut down. Well
9717460	9722220	I guess I guess it's on one hand is Apple's walled garden. You see that they they pretty
9722220	9728060	much control what apps make it onto their store and I guess they ran afoul with the
9728060	9732900	fact that they're creating something that allowed you to run code which is a big no
9732900	9739300	no for Apple. And I can see that bypass the store in itself. Think about it. You create
9739300	9744980	an app in basic and like Commodore basic you could pretty much run any any other app and
9744980	9751260	the other like music synth you know sit chip synthesizer for example. Bingo. Bingo. It's
9751260	9755640	too much. It leaves it too vulnerable. I kind of actually understand where Apple's coming
9755640	9760540	from for the model they're trying to build. I guess Sega basically dodged it by creating
9760540	9766620	a stand alone a stand alone emulator hard coded for Sonic and Golden Axe and so there's
9766620	9772700	no way you would have been able to run an arbitrary code. So I guess if those C64 guys
9772700	9778540	want to make their apps on the app store they just got to like make you know drastic changes
9778540	9783140	to the point where they have to bundle the games that they license them from. So it's
9783140	9788340	going to be one app for the last ninja. One app. Or not even that. You could probably
9788340	9795020	make it like one app for several Commodore 64 games or something like that or you could
9795020	9799540	sell the other games as DLC. But then you know where it's not going to work is that
9799540	9804060	you can't. Now you have to get all the original publishers involved. You know what I mean?
9804060	9809380	As opposed to being able to run all your old code. I probably could find. I bet I could
9809380	9815180	find my old Commodore 64 floppies and the mass amounts of games I had. I would love
9815180	9819460	to have a night. We seriously need to like plan the time we are going to freaking do
9819460	9825780	this. Just do some seriously hardcore old fucking school gaming on big televisions.
9825780	9828660	Well, we've got the vault.
9828660	9833660	There was a lot of classic gaming there too. I mean I don't know if Adam saw it but yeah
9833660	9841500	there was pretty much a 2600, two NES's, one with Duck Hunt running, an old Neo Geo cabinet
9841500	9845660	and just like really old school consoles right there in one particular room out of six game
9845660	9847060	rooms that weekend.
9847060	9851020	I really want to figure out. Maybe we could do this at a con or something tag on to some
9851020	9855800	con. I want to broadcast it and I want to marathon obscure classic games. I don't want
9855800	9859860	to do like Mario Brothers and all that. It's some type of charity thing but it's all obscure
9859860	9864740	shit like stuff that you may not have played before like Impossible Mission or other conversation
9864740	9865740	for years.
9865740	9868120	What about that Penn and Teller game? That Penn and Teller game where you just drive
9868120	9869540	on a bus for hours.
9869540	9874900	Yeah but let's face it. The joke is that the game is stupid. I don't want to do something
9874900	9875900	like that.
9875900	9878140	No but seriously you could actually do a charity thing.
9878140	9881820	Go through our own classic game of the week archive and pick like ten of those obscure
9881820	9884100	games and play those.
9884100	9888700	I had my share of obscure games and I had my NES so I pretty much have a good pick.
9888700	9894580	Zeba says at PAX please. Dude if we could get a room at PAX somehow like that I would
9894580	9898400	love that except we're probably not big enough but I never thought about it either.
9898400	9903860	You have to start with the con at the con level since that's pretty much your domain
9903860	9908420	at the moment. PAX is kind of like major. It's like a major indie thing. It's kind of
9908420	9912500	like the E3 of indie games.
9912500	9916620	I agree we need to piggyback on a con somewhere. Maybe I need to talk to the SacAnime people.
9916620	9922060	We'll see. We need to do a lock in. We need to rent the Masonic Lodge for a weekend and
9922060	9923540	do a lock in. That would be cool.
9923540	9926500	Alright Zaku we're going to let you go so we can get some more comments but thank you
9926500	9928060	you have a good one buddy.
9928060	9929820	Yeah have a good weekend man.
9929820	9930820	Later.
9930820	9934580	Rama says I need to book a room for OLR at PAX East. Yes you do because guess what Rama
9934580	9940060	I'm coming. I want to go to PAX East so make it happen.
9940060	9943260	Okay do we have more last minute stories? I'm sorry 877 game OLR we can do like one
9943260	9944780	more call probably.
9944780	9952220	Yeah there's some interesting stuff. They're doing a new Mega Man EXE game. Mega Man EXE
9952220	9956780	Operator Shooting Star and what's interesting though is it's going to be kind of a cross
9956780	9963620	game with Mega Man ZX as well. So you've got ZX and the EXE universe kind of crossing into
9963620	9971540	a brand new game and that was announced in Japan. And then finally there's a new record
9971540	9978580	being broken. The Frogger score held by fictional character George Costanda is going to be challenged
9978580	9979580	I guess this weekend.
9979580	9983260	Hmm interesting. We got a call. You're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this?
9983260	9985540	This is RPG King 7.
9985540	9989660	RPG King 7. Are you truly the king of RPGs?
9989660	9992420	I like to think I'm the seventh in line. There are guys above me.
9992420	9995980	Have you played this Final Fantasy 4 after years? That's what I'm all the rage about
9995980	9996980	right now.
9996980	9999940	No not yet. I don't have a Wii so.
9999940	10002940	Oh my gosh. You've got to figure out a way to play it though.
10002940	10006100	My parents have a Wii so I'll probably get it.
10006100	10009620	There you go. I know you probably called in to talk about something else but I've got
10009620	10012980	to ask you a question because I want to talk about after years with somebody and you're
10012980	10016460	the best thing I've got because you're at least RPG King. Did you hear the story about
10016460	10019940	the whole Chrono Trigger fan project getting shut down?
10019940	10022660	Oh my god you're reading my mind. That's exactly what I wanted to bring up.
10022660	10026100	Ah okay then you say your thing and then I'll say mine.
10026100	10030780	Well I was wondering you know why isn't the convention and bring up that they they were
10030780	10035260	like practically complete and then Square struck them down. I'm wondering what do you
10035260	10039780	what do you guys think Square is being so anal about it whereas there's like a million
10039780	10044020	Mario and other fan projects and the other publishers haven't said boo.
10044020	10047820	Ah ah you read my mind because because and I have the answer this is what I was going
10047820	10056200	to ask you about okay because this Final Fantasy 4 after years is that Chrono Trigger fan project.
10056200	10063900	It is a re-skinned remapped enhanced slightly version of Final Fantasy 4 but with the text
10063900	10068500	hack to be a new story with some new sprites and some new music put in. Now granted I probably
10068500	10071460	shouldn't label this thing a hack. I mean obviously there's more to it than that but
10071460	10075780	that type of thing that they did with Chrono Trigger those fans is what they're trying
10075780	10081180	to do with the this after years project. So my thought is if this after years thing is
10081180	10086100	successful and I think a lot of people were thinking what how rude of Square to shut down
10086100	10089940	this project. Where was the harm going to be? What were they doing? Well yeah like even
10089940	10094500	that sorry I just want to jump into that other project that was a few years ago where they
10094500	10100220	built up a 3D version of it from the ground up and they Square cut them off pretty early.
10100220	10104620	That wasn't that long ago I remember that though. Again I think protecting their rights
10104620	10109740	because Square's been doing all these remakes on the DS that are in 3D so maybe they want
10109740	10117940	to do something like that I don't know. But yeah I think they're doing it because they
10117940	10122420	they they don't want to shut the door on the possibility to do that stuff later on.
10122420	10129100	Yeah because I remember years and years ago they copyrighted the name Chrono Break and
10129100	10134260	people were thinking oh man they're going to do Chrono Trigger but you know they haven't
10134260	10140620	done anything. I don't know maybe it's going to be the ace in the hole or whatever but
10140620	10144860	I know the fans are getting restless. Why are they continuing to shut down all these
10144860	10148500	projects if they're not going to do anything with the Chrono Trigger franchise? I don't
10148500	10154180	know. Yeah I mean look at Nintendo they had their whole fan project that did Earthbound
10154180	10160580	or Mother 3 and it looks like we're never ever going to get that. I know it's sad it's
10160580	10164340	very sad and I wish I wish we would because Earthbound's a fun series but and they could
10164340	10168340	put it on WiiWare like that it would be so easy but for whatever reason they just don't
10168340	10173420	want to do it. Sorry I didn't mean to catch up. No it's okay. I was saying that you know
10173420	10178020	the whole DSiWare and one of the speculations I remember hearing was that you know they'll
10178020	10182300	put the old Gameboy and Gateway Dance games on there. They put Earthbound 3 on there they'll
10182300	10187780	get a huge number of people buying that up. Yeah but hopefully they're just not afraid
10187780	10191060	of like you know and I remember hearing an argument before that there's too much parody
10191060	10193900	in there that they're worried about getting sued or something like that I just I hope
10193900	10198220	they just get over that whatever that is. It's a freaking video game. People need to
10198220	10201860	get over it. Alright well RPG King we gotta let you go to get some more calls but do you
10201860	10207100	have any other final thoughts for our listeners? No it's just keep the RPG love alive. Alright
10207100	10211740	we will try our best. Okay thanks. Alright take care. Yeah the less I play MMOs the more
10211740	10218860	I can play RPGs so I will do my best. We can probably get one more call in 1877 Game OLR
10218860	10225260	or Orange Launch Radio on Skype but really really one more call. Um Loki. Anyways as
10225260	10231300	I was saying George Costanza from Seinfeld his fictional Frogger high score is gonna
10231300	10238300	be challenged this weekend for whatever reason I don't know. Um also apparently Nintendo
10238300	10243880	had another handheld system that they finished however they're not gonna release it because
10243880	10248620	apparently in the history of Nintendo there are such um or there are several examples
10248620	10253240	of such devices like this but when we are launching new hardware the most important
10253240	10258940	thing is to sustain the momentum and if introducing new hardware won't do anything to do that
10258940	10264780	well. So uh let me go to the phones. Hi you're on Orange Launch Radio who's this? Hey it's
10264780	10268820	Sturlok. Hi Sturlok what's on your mind tonight buddy? Eh not a whole lot didn't think you
10268820	10273820	guys were doing a show tonight. Surprise why wouldn't we do a show tonight? I thought last
10273820	10278380	week you said something about being back in two weeks. You know what our anniversary show
10278380	10282240	is in two weeks I think that well maybe that explains our dip in listeners tonight I don't
10282240	10287120	know but no our anniversary show is in two weeks. Yeah well plus it's Father's Day so
10287120	10290740	people are probably out doing stuff. True but you know I think those of us that you
10290740	10294940	know needed to take care of business already did so we you know did that earlier today.
10294940	10298560	So what's on your mind to uh what what are you thinking about tonight's show any topics
10298560	10303560	you want to bring up? Um I actually just uh tuned in um but I actually wanted to bring
10303560	10311920	this up last week about the whole Crimson Echoes thing um it's it's kind of ironic because
10311920	10318100	uh you know you brought up a month or three which is I think one of the better RPGs you
10318100	10325340	know ever made recently. Um but anyway there was a fan game um it was kind of a prequel
10325340	10335180	to uh Earthbound and it's you know a full RPG um it's granted it's not a rom hack it's
10335180	10342100	a you know it was done in like RPG Maker or something but you know it looks halfway decent
10342100	10346860	and you know it uses a bunch of music and sound effects from Earthbound and you know
10346860	10351700	you don't see Nintendo getting all you know butthurt over it. It's kind of interesting
10351700	10355620	to see where these companies will draw the line because if you think about it Square
10355620	10361620	I mean how much different is these type of rom hacks and so forth well okay I get it
10361620	10364700	because it's a rom hack but some of these other fan projects like maybe things that
10364700	10368980	aren't necessarily rom hacks but games let's say built in RPG Maker from the ground up
10368980	10375420	or what have you they're basically enhanced fan fiction. Exactly. It's what it is I mean
10375420	10379760	it's it's no different than logging on to a Harry Potter forum and reading the stories
10379760	10386400	people have invented. Yeah or like you know if you were going to buy go by Squares logic
10386400	10394340	you know fanfiction.net would not exist. I don't know it's kind of ridiculous in my opinion
10394340	10401180	but maybe the problem that they have at Square is the rom hack element of it but then again
10401180	10405300	I guess you know but they also have a 3D. But they made it they made they did try to
10405300	10410700	make it perfectly clear that the rom image itself would not be included in this thing
10410700	10416540	it was just a patch just like the mother 3 translation was just a patch you you have
10416540	10421940	to attain the the rom yourself. But maybe it was just the whole fact that it was encouraging
10421940	10427660	the altercation of an intellectual property of Square. Yeah. Don't get me wrong I think
10427660	10431540	the whole thing's a little silly and I don't think they stood to lose anything at all but
10431540	10435500	maybe they just don't want someone out there competing with themselves because I didn't
10435500	10439340	it didn't make sense to me until I played Final Fantasy IV the after years. I know what
10439340	10443700	you mean that you when you brought that up I was like wow shit that's a really good point
10443700	10449820	yeah that's kind of what that is. Exactly I know I know it didn't hit me until I played
10449820	10456540	that and then I was like oh I get the lawsuit now. Yeah. So all right well hey thank you
10456540	10460100	so much for the call we're gonna let you go so we can wrap up the show but we'll see you
10460100	10463900	next week we will be here next week just so you know it's a big show for us. Yeah. All
10463900	10467660	right we'll see you then. All right see you later. All right we're gonna go ahead and
10467660	10470820	close up the skype line thank you guys so much for calling in but I keep cutting Loki
10470820	10475860	off every time he tries to finish the story because. And it's very rude. I'm sorry but
10475860	10479180	you know the callers we want to want them to be heard and I don't like them being on
10479180	10482580	hold for 30 minutes because then we hear all their background noise and some of them will
10482580	10490580	start going hello hello and you're trying to do a thing so we try to get to them quickly.
10490580	10497300	Yeah. All right. Rock band the metal track pack apparently some achievements have leaked
10497300	10502260	out some of the songs included with that that are actually not released yet because you
10502260	10507780	know with the country track pack they did 13 new tracks in there and they're of course
10507780	10512500	some were you know already released but there's some new tracks as well. Same with the metal
10512500	10517220	track pack which is coming later this year and some of the songs include with that Motorhead
10517220	10525300	Killed by Death Hawk Wind Master of the Universe Blue Oyster Cult looks like a trans maniac
10525300	10532980	on MC and Nazareth Hair of the Dog. So that's four songs you can look to look forward to
10532980	10537480	on rock band that haven't come out yet and probably will come out after the metal track
10537480	10550780	pack on the rock band store. And not really a story but Arma 2 looks awesome. That was
10550780	10554940	the one you were showing me with the plane. That was the one it's it's like it's it's
10554940	10563660	done by the same people they're doing Operation Dragon or was it Operation what was it now
10563660	10570900	Operation Flashpoint 2 Dragon Rising but they have another game coming out actually next
10570900	10577860	week on PC Arma 2 with they've got tons of AI that are fighting this like war that you're
10577860	10582860	actually just part of and a really detailed kind of open world Call of Duty type of game
10582860	10587980	but it's got you know little funny things in there like there's a sniper on a on an
10587980	10592740	airfield and this plane was taking off and the plane saw the sniper and so it veered
10592740	10597580	to the left really quick and just crashed into the trees which is kind of funny so the
10597580	10601200	game needs to be bug tested maybe a little bit but hey you should post that YouTube in
10601200	10605580	chat because it is it's pretty funny yeah so do that sorry to the podcast listeners
10605580	10611980	you don't get to see that but you search for it on YouTube Arma 2 and I'm trying to find
10611980	10617700	the funny video I'll find it all right well that's gonna do it for tonight's show thank
