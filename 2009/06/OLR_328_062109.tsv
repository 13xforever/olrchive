84001	85002	Well, yeah.
85142	85462	Well, yeah.
85522	85802	All right.
86182	87523	And playing Sims 3 again.
87563	88463	That's two in a row.
88503	90604	Well, yeah, but I'm only doing it in the background.
90624	91204	No, that's all right.
92105	93145	How is Sims life going?
94046	103970	Well, for some reason, okay, there's a very small chance of getting knocked up with just plain old woohoo, as in fucking, and it always seems to happen to mine.
104350	106531	Whoopee, like they used to say on the newlywed game show.
107251	107511	Rob.
107911	108132	What?
108272	108792	It's fucking.
108812	109132	It's fucking.
110063	111705	Don't you remember the old newlywed game show?
112145	114047	Where's the strangest place you've ever had Whoopi?
114728	115408	In the butt, Bob.
118291	124497	Also joining us, and I don't want to know the strangest place he's ever had Whoopi because the wife's into porn.
124517	125999	Say hello to Tech Master Loki.
126779	127200	Hello.
127480	128301	How are you doing, Loki?
128341	128761	Doing good.
128941	129302	All right.
131564	132605	I don't know what else to ask you.
132885	133186	All right.
133646	133966	Anyhow.
135290	137152	DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
155405	181077	Well, I played Peggle on iPhone Okay, that's different And it was pretty fun I just played it once and got to the third level, I guess So it was pretty fun I love those types of games, though And, of course, playing Sims 3 Which is pretty cool Okay, people in the modding community Hurry up and fix their damn faces And fix the damn hair I'll give you a dollar Start now
184594	191824	and I played Black Knight 2000.
192745	193587	The pinball game?
193727	194388	The pinball game.
194548	196070	I can hear pinball noises, by the way.
196110	197732	We just got a Lord of the Rings.
197933	200056	We got rid of Creature from the Black Lagoon, finally.
200703	202644	I liked Creature from the Black Lagoon, but whatever.
204004	204664	Machine was a bitch.
204784	205144	That's right.
205905	211146	It seems like it would be a bitch to maintain because isn't it like the thing where there's a top level and then there's like a see-through underneath that or something?
211166	213327	It's just like a hologram and you can just change out the hologram.
213547	213827	Interesting.
213987	220649	But really, Dan really wanted Lord of the Rings so he said he'd get rid of Creature for Lord of the Rings and the opportunity came up.
220929	222069	And he's out there playing it right now.
222229	223650	He's been playing it.
223770	226691	I know practically every piece of dialogue coming out of that game now.
227651	228031	Very nice.
228684	236247	and I've been playing a lot of Solitaire and I downloaded a bunch of games for my new netbook.
236327	246911	I put Linux Mint on it so I've been exploring the gaming in Linux and actually they've got a bunch of game packages just available to select.
247211	251113	I'm playing one called Capman, which is Pac-Man.
252703	254643	and Sudoku and some of the little stuff.
254663	255724	They have a version of Lode Runner.
256444	257884	They have all kinds of neat stuff.
258224	260124	As soon as I find kicks, I'll be happy.
261124	262825	And you've been enjoying your Linux Mint, I know.
262865	266365	You've been talking about installing it on one of your computers for months now.
266405	273787	I was going to do the old one, but every time it happened, something would go wrong or the CD had a scratch or some crap.
274487	277587	And so I finally just said, you know, fuck it.
277707	279588	Completely got rid of...
282568	294033	I completely got rid of XP because I hated all the crap that Dell put on it and just like you know what I'm gonna go completely Linux on it and I don't regret it at all.
294153	299015	I love having multiple desktops especially on such a small screen and it's been pretty cool.
299295	299635	I like it.
300225	305307	Alright, well, sounds like you've actually been pretty busy with games that weren't The Sims.
305367	306747	I'm actually kind of surprised.
307147	308267	Yeah, duh!
308327	310048	But then also plenty of Sims 3, I'm sure.
310208	312809	Well, yeah.
312929	313769	They're making out right now.
313889	314949	They're making out right now.
314969	318611	I was going to ask you to update the listeners on what's going on in their Sim world right now.
318651	324052	Well, I actually started over with the same couple because I got tired of them having nothing but girls.
325493	327233	They seriously had nothing but girls.
327733	329954	So, I started over.
331515	336165	I started over and I'm just hoping for a boy.
336847	337809	Well, no, they've got a boy now.
337989	338470	Oh, they do now.
338510	339513	If they have a girl now, I don't care.
340387	341948	All right, let's move on.
342008	343168	Loki, how was your gaming week?
344369	344829	It was all right.
345069	345670	Didn't play much.
345950	348151	I played Grand Theft Auto 4 still.
348791	356735	And then I also played Saints Row 2 when, you know, obviously live was down on Tuesday for a brief moment.
357215	359536	So, well, actually all day.
360156	366139	But that meant we had to play something that would allow us to play System Link and Saints Row 2 would be that game.
366419	369601	And I kicked the crap out of everybody in Saints Row 2 really bad.
371842	379026	I did go back though and play some more Saints Row 2 with the actual download expansions that were available for it.
379046	383909	There's only two real paid expansions, so I had already downloaded both of those.
385069	386370	And they're okay.
387987	395370	There is one escort mission I have to do for escorting some... I have to guard these trucks that are picking up nuclear waste.
396210	398331	And, unfortunately, they're really retarded.
398891	408935	And they keep, you know, the cops just spawn out of nowhere and just crash straight into the front of the truck and just kind of sit there for a while and does constant damage.
408975	413416	So I have had to repeat the mission about eight times and I still haven't passed it yet.
413576	414957	And it's really annoying, so...
416129	417230	I hate escort missions.
418150	418610	All the time.
418730	420171	Because the AI is really annoying.
421312	424493	And then the rest of the missions are just kind of what you normally expect in the game.
425734	430936	Apparently these are the last two actual things that they're adding on there.
433246	435127	Oh well, I guess I'm done with Saints Row 2.
436387	439008	But then Grand Theft Auto 4, I'm looking to mod it some more.
439508	442289	And I've been just waiting to get my computer set up, which I did today.
442909	446170	So hopefully later this week I'll be able to tweak it some more.
447290	447630	That's it.
448911	449251	Alright.
449971	451352	How's the house going, by the way?
451432	455773	I know we talked a little bit about your new house last week, but now you're getting settled in a little more, probably.
456204	459265	Still unpacking, got the internet and cable hooked up and everything.
459345	463966	So just still unpacking and trying to get things cleaned up.
464406	472329	My mom and my grandparents came over yesterday and they were helping with just some of the stuff I need to get done around the house.
472449	477930	You know, patching holes in the wall and painting stuff and that kind of thing.
477990	483032	So yeah, it's just a constant project, I guess.
484012	484252	All right.
485185	485725	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
508735	511336	I actually played a game through to completion.
511856	512176	I know.
512196	512657	What was that?
512737	513397	Shock and awe.
513477	520620	Because I have this thing called Gaming ADD where I always jump from one game to another spending $60 on one game, never finishing it and going to another.
520920	524281	I'm sure plenty of you are like that because a lot of games take a long time to beat.
524862	527883	But the game I beat was Final Fantasy IV The After Years.
528323	529624	Although I didn't really beat it.
530444	532185	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
550959	552319	I want to say two things about the story.
552699	557200	One, for a real fan of Final Fantasy IV, this story is great.
557380	559481	I think it is a great written sequel.
560181	562061	And that's just basing it off the main episode.
562081	568862	But even just reading what I've read about the upcoming episodes and so on, I think this story is going to be great and real fan service to fans of the original.
569162	573943	But the second thing I want to say about the story is, if you haven't played the original, don't bother with this game.
574003	575523	It will not make sense to you.
576023	579044	There is so much that references the original Final Fantasy...
579444	581005	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
605543	606244	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
626585	630167	and then in Final Fantasy 4 you go underground but the airship can't fly over lava.
630567	632647	So then you get the Uber airship that can fly over lava.
632908	637429	So, you know, they have ways of restricting where you can go and they definitely do that in this game.
637469	639330	It's not all open from the start.
639410	643692	But, yeah, I, you know, if you're a fan of the original game you gotta have this game.
643732	652975	I know it's taking a lot of crap for the fact that it is episodic and that they are charging, you know, $3 every episode means the game's gonna cost, you know, probably like $30 for all the parts.
653336	653936	But you know what?
654736	662324	I try to also value my game on how much time I'm getting out of it and how much reward I'm getting from the investment.
662725	666228	And honestly, if these three bucks a pop are going to be...
667748	668989	Thank you for watching!
694722	695983	Let's see, other games I've been playing this week.
696003	701165	Speaking of old school role-playing games, I was playing Phantasy Star 2 for a good chunk of time this week, right?
701465	702105	Well, here's the thing.
702385	703246	Dude, I have that game.
703486	706307	Okay, you know Trixie360 on Twitter, right?
706367	707648	Trixie, she's great.
707728	708808	She just had her baby, too.
708828	709329	Congratulations.
709369	709689	She did.
709709	711910	Congratulations, Trixie, who just had baby Trixie this week.
711950	713891	She just spawned this week.
713911	714691	Yes, she just spawned.
715271	725098	But, uh, yeah, she, um, she was giving away codes, and, uh, you know, I just happened to be on Twitter one night when she was giving them away, and I was like, okay, my Google Foo skills are awesome.
725599	728541	These little trivia questions she's asking about the 90s, I can do this.
728641	729001	I can do this.
729281	733885	I do this for the online games I play all the time that don't relate to video games with, like, some of the roleplay I do.
734746	742932	I can Google Foo faster than anyone, and sure enough, the second time she gave away a code that I was watching, I won a code for Phantasy Star 2, which...
743752	748533	In retrospect, seems a little useless because I do have the Sonic Genesis collection.
748553	752534	But I, you know, I wanted to see, did this game offer anything different?
753194	755234	And the answer is, not really.
755454	758695	Except achievements are in it, for what it's worth.
758875	761735	I haven't gotten any yet because you have to get to level 10 to get the first one.
761775	766596	I only played... You want to talk about a game, an old school game, where you have to do a lot of freaking grinding?
766916	768016	Okay, right from the start.
768296	770877	You can't really go anywhere until you grind your way to level 3 or 4.
770937	772537	You have to start off poor.
772737	774179	I've actually got a figure of her.
774199	774680	The one that turned out
787895	788576	Well, don't spoil.
788696	791799	I'm just kidding.
791919	792660	No, I know.
792680	793300	20 years old.
794862	795322	Not true.
795723	797745	Because I never played it on the Genesis.
798085	804712	But granted, I could have gotten it on PlayStation 1 or any of the millions of times they've re-released this game.
805072	807194	But for whatever reason, I'm just now playing it.
807254	808575	She actually doesn't turn out evil.
808615	810197	It's something else weird that happens to her.
810497	811198	Ah, okay.
811218	812019	So it's not really...
812239	812599	That's right.
813359	814760	I've barely been paying attention to the story.
814780	816941	But if you want my little figurine, you can have it, because she's cute.
817521	817761	Maybe.
817821	818401	She's a cat girl.
819001	820202	I've been having fun with it so far.
820622	821722	I'll have to play a little more.
822002	826244	There are leaderboards, too, which is something a little extra you don't have in the Mega Genesis Collection.
826784	833226	And also, the smoothing is in both, but the save system's a little different, but that's not really anything to hoop and holler about.
833546	836847	You can save anywhere in the game, though, and I don't remember.
836867	839908	I didn't play it enough in the Mega Collection to know if that was the case.
840328	847778	I think for anybody that owns a collection, there really probably isn't much point to having this game unless you really want achievements or you are just that much of a fan of the system.
847798	851823	I kind of wonder why they decided to release that collection if they were planning to release these games.
851863	853565	It would seem to me that it would be a good idea to...
854329	855750	Suck in all the money that you can, then BOOM!
855790	855990	Yeah, yeah.
877006	878487	Anyway, Phantasy Star 2 is alright.
878627	882971	If you haven't played it one of the million other ways you can get that game, then it's worth checking out.
883011	887735	It is a piece of gaming history known for its notoriety of being an incredibly difficult RPG.
888356	889537	God, seriously though.
890017	893600	I think it's actually one of the best Sega RPGs out.
894101	895802	And that's why they've released it so many times.
897063	899726	Make sure that people who want it can get it.
900106	900246	Yeah.
901249	902369	Okay, let's see.
903049	903930	What else have I been playing this week?
903950	904770	I've actually been playing a lot.
904830	906590	Fuel is another game I've checked out.
906610	909271	This is something that Loki was raving about on the show a couple weeks ago.
909771	913032	I mentioned that I touched the game last week, but I hadn't really played a lot.
913392	915412	I've spent a lot more time with Fuel this week.
915612	919413	And, you know, I think, honestly, you're going to have to file this game and love it or hate it.
919653	923014	Because I've been trying to look at some of the mainstream reviews, which I don't usually do.
923414	927915	But I've been trying to figure out why the game has not been scoring kind of better as a whole.
928255	930136	Because I think there is a lot to this game.
931896	933678	I think it's really just a love it or hate it type of game.
934018	937021	There are some pretty in-your-face type of flaws with the game.
937061	941827	There is some graphical clipping that is just like, oh my gosh, did I really just drive right through that tree?
942087	943408	Did that really just happen?
943428	944790	There are some big flaws.
945491	948574	I feel like this game was slightly rushed.
948774	949815	If they just spent...
950396	950957	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
972816	973256	Yeah, the GPS.
996795	1004802	or all these liveries on your GPS or you can actually run into cars and get the car a little later on when you unlock the second area.
1004822	1005342	You can do that.
1006363	1007564	So it's kind of neat.
1008885	1011547	A lot for somebody who likes to collect things in games.
1011948	1012829	Did you?
1013029	1014210	Arcade style controls.
1014290	1016712	Did you try driving from the first camp to the second camp?
1016732	1017973	You know I have a funny story about that.
1018013	1023457	Yes I did because I wanted to get that achievement because I looked at what achievements you had got and I figured well anything Loki has I can get.
1024278	1029101	So I actually tried to get that achievement, and the funny thing is I didn't finish it because I got fooled.
1029541	1035004	As I was driving there, and right when I crossed into that second zone, it said, oh, achievement unlocked.
1035324	1038385	And I was like, oh, well, I guess I don't really have to drive all the way into the base camp.
1038405	1038906	Well, that's cool.
1038926	1039306	That's easy.
1039326	1041887	You just have to drive from the one map line to the other.
1042288	1042608	Whoops.
1042908	1047890	The achievement I found out later that I really got was the one for driving 100 miles cumulatively.
1048231	1049871	I just happened to get it at that moment.
1050432	1052033	And so now I'm going to have to go back and do it again.
1053093	1057117	It's cool though because you drive through a forest fire while you're going there.
1057157	1058958	That's where I actually unlocked it.
1059619	1061540	They have done some pretty imaginative things with the game.
1061961	1063102	I just don't think it's for everyone.
1063122	1066504	I think there's a lot of people that are going to pick this up and go, what the hell's the point?
1067505	1068166	What am I doing?
1069867	1073910	The game is not kind into kind of a ramp up learning curve.
1074431	1075952	You just are kind of thrown into it.
1076132	1077533	Okay, so what do I do?
1078174	1080336	You're kind of like, do I drive around aimlessly?
1080516	1081056	Do I...
1081897	1083698	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1107475	1110997	But I thought maybe this was because I was adventuring out in the middle of nowhere in the second world.
1111418	1113699	Or second section of the map that you unlock.
1114019	1115920	So maybe everybody's in the first area.
1116020	1116301	I don't know.
1116321	1117962	Or maybe it was because I was playing at 1 a.m.
1118022	1118462	on Saturday.
1118942	1119403	I don't know.
1119843	1121864	But I didn't run into anybody.
1122104	1123765	But I did try some of the Xbox Live races.
1126812	1127313	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1146414	1148395	And it was like hardly anything on the map.
1148435	1149815	We got to a new area and that was it.
1149956	1153717	You actually, you can get further faster if you're smart about the way you do it.
1153817	1157659	If you drive on the freeways with a freeway vehicle, you'll go really fast.
1157959	1163001	But if you try to just go from point A to B off-road, like as the crow flies, you're not going to get there as fast.
1163321	1168063	You really do have to take the freeways and the bullet car and go 110 miles an hour to get places faster.
1168543	1170344	It's just, you know, you're so tempted.
1170384	1172425	Like, I just want to drive off-road, you know.
1172625	1173085	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1192052	1193713	Some of it gets a little annoying.
1193913	1196054	Like, some of the challenges that are just endurance.
1196174	1197974	Like, it's a 15-minute race.
1198315	1199095	I'm not even joking.
1199395	1200675	From one point to another.
1200976	1206218	And then to, like, come in second on that 15-minute race and get nothing for it is a little frustrating.
1206418	1208679	Like, you don't get a silver medal or anything.
1208739	1209559	It's like, oh, you lose.
1209579	1210159	Do you want to try again?
1210179	1212140	Or the chasing the copter thing and you're just like...
1212740	1214042	Oh, I took the wrong turn.
1214542	1214843	Crap.
1215023	1215323	Yeah.
1215724	1218387	There are some areas like that where it's like, come on.
1219328	1227258	That is like one big thing I would have fixed is I would have given some type of reward for second and third place or give me a reason to waste 15 minutes, you know?
1227878	1228078	Yeah.
1228099	1229000	So, yeah.
1229480	1232922	But otherwise, there's a lot of collectible to it.
1233202	1233883	I will play it again.
1233903	1235383	I've got to play with Loki online at some point.
1235644	1238305	We're going to have a race to drive from one point to another.
1239106	1239726	It would be cool.
1240967	1241267	We'll see.
1241727	1247330	Gosh, I've talked a lot about games, but I've had time to play them again thanks to not playing WoW.
1247811	1248971	So there you go.
1249131	1249652	I guess that's it.
1249872	1251233	That's all I'm going to share for my gaming week.
1251253	1253034	I know there's been some other stuff, but that's all I want to share.
1253414	1254975	I want to actually get into some gaming news.
1255375	1256416	First, some housekeeping.
1257389	1257930	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1278487	1299749	essentially no break and when I say no break granted of course we've had a week off here and there for holidays or trips or travel or what have you but honestly there's never been a break longer than I think our longest downtime was three weeks once and that was like a one-time thing that happened but we've been going like non-stop ever since I don't even think it was three weeks I think it was two weeks when like we were moving out of
1300269	1302210	One... Like, remember when Loki and I used to live together?
1302250	1302811	We did the show there?
1302831	1303471	Yeah, that's about it.
1303531	1309034	I think when we moved from that to the new setup, I think that was our longest break we had, because it was such a big move.
1309514	1312436	So... But yeah, seven years of Orange Launch Radio, believe it or not.
1312456	1316959	When we started doing this show, I was just about to have my 24th birthday.
1317439	1322862	I was 23 years old, and now I'm gonna be... It's funny enough, OLR started three days before my birthday.
1323102	1324763	So now I'm turning 31 this week.
1325063	1326764	That's a long time of doing this show.
1327324	1327545	But...
1328605	1329546	Yeah, they're still going.
1329566	1330227	You know what?
1330887	1332529	Things get the best when you're in your 30s.
1332569	1333150	That's what I say.
1333250	1333650	That's right.
1334130	1340236	So, okay, and we'll be actually having more of a celebration, quote unquote, next week, although we have nothing special planned.
1340717	1341738	So, I don't know.
1341858	1346282	When you start to get a certain age, you kind of hope other people will throw you a surprise party so you don't have to do any work.
1346402	1346862	No, I'm kidding.
1347243	1348584	I don't know what there is to do.
1350746	1356030	So certainly we'll open up the Skype line to your calls about the show, maybe share some favorite moments.
1356711	1366798	Some of you guys, I would love, some of you guys that are archive experts of the show, dig up some of your favorite moments that are out there and available, and we'll try to replay some of them next week if we can find any.
1367179	1368179	So there you go.
1368860	1369761	Seven years next week.
1371155	1374276	TigerClaw points out, and I've been ignoring chat all night, I apologize.
1374616	1379018	TigerClaw points out, today is a holiday, well sort of, of course, Father's Day.
1379418	1386501	So to all of our gaming dads out there today, happy Father's Day to you, or whatever father figure happens to be in your life.
1386561	1388482	Maybe a grandpa or a brother, I don't know.
1388542	1391283	So happy Father's Day to all of you fatherly figures out there.
1391783	1397185	And as TigerClaw says in chat, today is a holiday, well sort of, happy about to be a Father's Day for Loki.
1397845	1399747	since as we all know the wife is Prager's.
1400388	1402150	Well, they celebrated it for me anyway.
1402170	1404112	They got a shop vac, which is awesome.
1404212	1404572	Oh, nice.
1404952	1405533	Power tools.
1406374	1407415	Yeah, I need the shop vac.
1407435	1408556	Like any good father should have.
1408656	1409097	So there you go.
1410205	1412886	Alright, well, let's get into the show tonight.
1413006	1416527	And for those that listened last week, which I hope you all did, it was on the podcast feed.
1416547	1418468	Our podcast feed's been on time lately.
1419608	1421929	We have kind of changed the format of our show a little bit.
1422389	1425010	Less stories, more time with each story.
1425070	1430812	Because, you know, you guys can go on and, you know, kind of get a rundown of the gaming news on hundreds of different websites.
1431212	1435053	But this is one of the only places where you can really talk about them with other gamers who aren't jerks.
1435653	1437594	And leave comments that say, first...
1438979	1440700	So let's talk about this week in gaming news.
1440720	1444581	There's been some big stories this week, especially a huge one.
1445161	1448622	DarkSakura is going to start us off tonight with some gaming news to talk about.
1448762	1450543	And your call is at 877-GAME-OLR.
1450783	1458186	Well, we have a case of it could be a business decision or it could just be a case of pissy bitchiness.
1458866	1459286	I don't know.
1459546	1461087	Activision's got some PMS going on.
1461867	1466829	They just say they might stop supporting Sony.
1467589	1481934	Actually, their CEO, Bobby Kotick, said that they would have to cut the price because they wouldn't be able to make the games that people would buy because the console is too expensive.
1482914	1489797	Also, I think there's a certain amount of cost that goes into doing anything for Sony because they've got some pretty expensive rates.
1490657	1496178	I said that they might just have to stop supporting Sony come 2010-2011.
1496419	1502360	And they're also considering not just the PS3, but the PSP as well.
1503080	1511222	They pay $500 million in royalties to Sony, which is roughly about 40% of their profit.
1512042	1514203	So under those circumstances...
1515784	1525693	I kind of don't blame them if they're trying to really make back their money honestly Xbox and Wii is going to be where it's at for Activision I would think
1528064	1528824	Loki, you agree?
1529004	1530965	It won't happen.
1531566	1535547	I don't know if I totally agree with the whole it's only there on Xbox and Wii.
1535847	1536348	I get it.
1536588	1537408	I get that sentiment.
1537728	1542170	But I do think you have your hardcore Sony audience that would justify the cost of porting the game.
1542330	1547712	Bobby Kotick has been bitching about the Sony PS3 price for a long time now.
1548193	1553075	Every time you hear about some Activision bitching about the price of the PS3, they think it's too high.
1553315	1554695	They think there should be a price drop.
1554715	1555996	They're hoping there's a price drop.
1556736	1558738	They're always complaining about the PS3 price.
1558778	1559318	And you know what?
1559338	1565482	They don't sell as many units on the PS3 as they do on the 360, but they still sell quite a bit.
1566142	1572307	And I'm sorry, but you're going to just cost average everything across the board for most of the games you develop.
1574105	1576887	Hey, if you don't want to develop for the PS3, then don't.
1577027	1589095	But I think franchises like Modern Warfare 2 and Guitar Hero and stuff, the PS3 is still a very integral part of those franchises.
1589615	1595519	And to just get rid of it because, oh, it's too expensive, well, that's not really a good reason.
1595900	1599222	Although, let's just say if they are crazy enough and they actually go through with it,
1600737	1602438	That's going to suck for Sony.
1602998	1606240	And that's going to be something I don't know if they can be able to make up ground on.
1607041	1607641	Empty threats?
1608301	1608782	Probably.
1610282	1611003	What do you guys think?
1611023	1614965	1-877-GAME-OLR or a username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
1614985	1616226	And I'm reading the chat room here.
1616586	1618127	Ranma says, good for Activision.
1619031	1632303	Now, from what I heard, or remember reading, EA, I guess, I don't know if maybe EA dropped, or Sega, they weren't supporting the Genesis or something like that at one time.
1632544	1635466	Like, EA had dropped them for similar reasons.
1637628	1638789	I don't know, it'd be interesting.
1638809	1640511	I don't think that's going to happen, though.
1640871	1644615	Because, I mean, all it would take is something like that to happen, you know, say...
1646623	1658349	Activision has stopped publishing Guitar Hero on the PS3 and boom, Rock Band will come in and swoop up all those sales right there.
1658470	1662131	Modern Warfare 2, I'm sure there's going to be another military shooter out there.
1662952	1666354	If not first party, then someone else putting something out.
1667114	1687647	and um I don't know it's not gonna just like it's not gonna just kill them for not having Activision there's a couple listeners in chat that want to say it's the Dreamcast that EA dropped oh Dreamcast okay okay that's what it was um I just I knew it was the Sega system but I couldn't remember which one um so yeah I mean I I doubt that at this point they're gonna do that
1689686	1691007	There is a response from Sony.
1691188	1695832	Obviously, this thing caught so much momentum around the internet that Sony had to make a response, and they did.
1696152	1697633	And the response goes something like this.
1698073	1708762	PlayStation has tremendous momentum coming out of E3, and we are seeing positive growth with more than 350 titles slated to hit across all of our platforms, including many anticipated games from our publishing partners.
1709363	1713647	And this, by the way, this quote is from Patrick Sebold, who is a spokesperson for PlayStation.
1714267	1721831	We enjoy healthy business relationships with and greatly value our publishing partners, and we are working closely with them to deliver the best entertainment experience.
1722231	1724012	So in other words, they didn't really address the issue.
1724632	1729695	They just kind of said, we still are awesome, and we're just going to ignore this guy because he's a boob.
1729895	1731816	Well, he may be a boob.
1731876	1732856	I mean, who knows?
1733537	1733997	He's kind of...
1735938	1737419	He seems to whine a lot, I guess.
1738079	1742043	And it really doesn't matter if he thinks there should be a price drop.
1742223	1745625	They shouldn't have to drop their price because he thinks there should be a price drop.
1745986	1746506	Fuck him.
1746566	1747587	He doesn't work for Sony.
1749482	1751023	DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
1772659	1773259	and so on and so forth.
1801688	1804710	I think that they're working on something similar to that with the PS3 as well.
1805010	1815676	Maybe that might be something that they can look at as an option to save some money for the third-party publishers and give them a reason to develop more on the PS3, but it's not a reason to drop them.
1816476	1817157	Thank you for watching!
1833311	1837012	I don't know though, because didn't a few companies leave ESA, but not everybody did?
1837192	1849316	I don't think necessarily one, and Activision was kind of, that's one reason I almost would believe this guy if he's a boob or not, is that Activision did drop ESA for a while, didn't they?
1849876	1850036	Yeah.
1858378	1863223	We have to set up freaking queues on our website to handle the load and they're gone in 15 minutes.
1863483	1866165	We don't need it.
1867006	1876454	On one hand, despite the thought that I'm kind of torn, I'm like, yeah, it sounds like an empty threat, but at the same time, track record shows Activision is willing to make good on these type of threats.
1876714	1877155	You know what I mean?
1878359	1880581	Well, he doesn't even have a time frame.
1880681	1881061	Oh, 2010, 2011.
1881922	1888167	If you do not drop your price by December 31st, 2009, we will be gone June 1st, 2010.
1888287	1890268	That seems like a closed-door conversation, though.
1890288	1890889	You know what I mean?
1891829	1894652	Part of me wonders, though, is this much ado about nothing?
1894992	1899996	Did this guy make an offhanded remark, a soundbite, if you will?
1900276	1907742	Did this guy just make a careless remark that got picked up and ran with by the gaming press and overanalyzed by folks like ourselves?
1909262	1910443	I kind of don't think so.
1910723	1912263	Well, who?
1912323	1912743	Kodak?
1913663	1915124	He made it to the Times.
1916404	1916984	I guess that's true.
1917004	1929987	I think he was pretty clear on it, but the fact is, I mean, how many times have we been reporting on, you know, company heads making stupid comments about something and, you know, and the fallout from it.
1930027	1937049	I mean, Sony is a perfect example of that, you know, and thank goodness they got rid of the crayon-eating...
1938659	1939503	Yeah, it's...
1942335	1942675	I don't know.
1942755	1946118	I don't think anything's really going to happen with this, and that's really kind of the issue.
1946218	1952202	And yes, I think that they should drop the price of their system, but for entirely different reasons other than Activision says so.
1952702	1955624	I mean, that's not the reason to drop the price of the system.
1955724	1957825	There's some good debate going on in our chat room right now.
1957885	1960347	Maybe that's why everybody's afraid to call in, which is fine.
1960487	1963229	And also, I think we had a slight listener dip tonight.
1963529	1966731	I don't know if everybody's aware, but we shifted a little bit on the radio stream.
1967392	1970254	It is not right now on the front page of allgames.com.
1970274	1971855	I guess they're doing some remodeling over there.
1971895	1972215	I don't know.
1972555	1973096	AllGamesRadio.com
1992211	1997359	But Ranma retorts with this, PS3 is not a premium console, neither is Xbox 360 or Wii.
1997739	2000903	Sony won't price drop because they'll take a higher loss on each unit.
2001324	2007613	Don't forget, Rob, Best Buy, GameStop, and other companies told Sony to drop the price of the PSP or else they'd stop selling it.
2010071	2033560	that is a problem when the companies that are selling your product are saying they're going to drop you I think more so than the publisher because to be honest they could probably make it through without Activision even though Activision right now is the number one publisher out there only because EA dropped the number two but I don't know it's not going to kill them if they go away
2034369	2036971	Let me read this comment as well from Bochikawa in our chatroom.
2037291	2041414	It's a total bluff, but it still puts into people's mindset to stop dealing with Sony.
2041534	2046578	And even then, I doubt they will stop dealings altogether, leaving ports or minor titles to them.
2046878	2047738	Because think about it.
2048019	2048679	Here's another thing.
2048779	2049200	Think about it.
2049560	2052742	Would you really want to ruin your relationship with Sony?
2053382	2057485	Say, okay, we're going to stop supporting the PlayStation 3 and the PSP.
2057906	2059287	Okay, the PlayStation 4 comes out.
2059947	2071091	Oh, you just burned your bridges with Sony because you're being a dick, and now you have the PS4 coming out, and you could have had some really good partnerships with them to get some good launch titles and that kind of thing.
2071391	2081535	Oh, but you were a dick, so now they're going to not, I don't know, maybe be so kind to you because you decided to drop them dead weight.
2082595	2084956	It may be possibly hurting the launch of your next system.
2085843	2090305	I don't know how I feel about the whole PlayStation 3 is not a premium console content.
2090385	2093626	I don't know if I necessarily call it premium, but let's face it.
2093726	2101269	The PlayStation 3 does have one big component you cannot ignore that the Xbox 360 and the Wii doesn't have, and that's Blu-ray.
2101369	2106710	Especially as we're getting into more high definition and Blu-rays are starting to penetrate the market more and more.
2106770	2108071	We're kind of where DVDs were.
2108451	2116937	What, 12 years ago, as Blu-rays are starting to penetrate the marketplace more and more, I don't think you can ignore the fact that the PlayStation 3 is the only one out there right now that's a Blu-ray player.
2117158	2126284	And that's not something that, despite all the rumors, Microsoft ain't even considering, and Nintendo sure as hell ain't considering this whole Blu-ray thing.
2126625	2129387	So that's one thing that Sony's always going to have, making it...
2129907	2131608	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2154822	2158224	And for the average consumer, the PS3 is an awesome Blu-ray player.
2158384	2160085	It does all the updating for them.
2160506	2164588	They don't need to worry about, oh, will this disc play in my system?
2164908	2171072	Because a lot of people out there that don't own a PS3 and just have a normal Blu-ray player, you need to have that thing connected to the internet.
2171312	2181718	And to update your system to the updated firmware so that it can play whatever Blu-ray movie is out there, there's a lot of...
2182438	2184000	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2205620	2213605	But I've got to think, now that Blu-ray has been out there for at least a few years now, the price of the components have to have come down by now.
2214865	2216486	They've got to find ways to cut costs.
2217547	2221109	Maybe putting out new systems with larger hard drives isn't the way to go.
2221309	2225331	Maybe you should just keep the same hard drive size and start dropping the price.
2225992	2227172	Or drop something else.
2227232	2227613	I don't know.
2227713	2228333	Make it cheaper.
2230649	2234571	Yeah, let's see, a couple more comments from chat.
2234851	2238372	Ranma says, Loki, that's reminiscent of the whole Nintendo Square debacle years ago.
2239993	2241354	Yeah, and Square's back.
2241934	2246896	That's true, but Nintendo did take a pretty big hit.
2248457	2252138	Final Fantasy going over to the PlayStation was huge.
2252778	2254119	It was just absolutely huge.
2254959	2255780	In some ways...
2256843	2260604	Maybe I'm just a little biased here because I happen to be a role-playing game fan.
2261164	2265065	I think Nintendo 64 didn't do so hot in part because of that.
2265225	2266705	Not really, but they did get Pokemon.
2266965	2268646	I mean, it was a Nintendo franchise.
2269326	2272406	But seriously, the Pokemon franchise... Oh, your sound is off.
2272446	2272987	Is your mic on?
2273587	2274687	No, it's... Sorry.
2275027	2280768	Well, I was going to say, Nintendo did have Pokemon to keep them above water pretty much.
2280928	2284129	I think that's what saved the Nintendo 64 as long as it did.
2286705	2287066	Let's see.
2287447	2290916	Two Africans in our chatroom says simply PlayStation 3 is a great system.
2292009	2292669	On what planet?
2293850	2294170	I don't know.
2294210	2295091	I think it is a good system.
2295671	2296311	It is a good system.
2296331	2297452	It's a good Blu-ray player.
2298072	2299633	Well, yeah, it's a good Blu-ray player.
2299753	2301654	It's much quieter than the Xbox 360.
2301734	2302935	I enjoy playing games on it.
2302955	2305236	It's got the better controller than the 360.
2305416	2307797	I disagree.
2307817	2311039	I don't fault the PS3 as a bad system at all.
2311099	2312279	I don't think it is a bad system.
2312319	2313740	I think they just marketed it terribly.
2314000	2316041	It was too expensive to begin with.
2316442	2318963	If I hadn't gotten mine for free from...
2319463	2320243	Let me go to the phones.
2320263	2321464	We just got a call.
2321484	2323305	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
2323325	2323805	Who's this?
2324025	2324346	Hi, Spazinator.
2324386	2327787	What's on your mind about this whole PlayStation 3 debacle going on in Activision?
2327807	2330249	Do you think they're going to make good on the threat?
2346229	2347169	No, not at all.
2347690	2364414	Well, there's a slight possibility, but the possibility of it's kind of, you know, there's always a possibility that, you know, it could snow in southern Mexico, but isn't very likely that it happens.
2365063	2366985	That's likely, but you never know.
2368026	2371229	Yeah, but I don't know if that's totally the same thing going on.
2371730	2378617	But what about, okay, like, I could ask the question, do you think Sony needs to drop the price of the console?
2378637	2380299	But who's not going to say yes to that?
2381260	2387246	But the question I'm going to ask is, do you think Sony has real legitimate reason to drop the price of their console right now?
2389363	2390884	Uh, yes and no.
2390944	2392585	Depends on how you want to look at it.
2392945	2395526	I'm kind of on the fence on that subject.
2397007	2411393	On one hand, I can see why they're not pricing it, because, you know, mainly because of the Blu-ray drive itself, they're still kind of expensive to manufacture, and they're already taking a hit by, you know, selling at the price they're at.
2412202	2438945	But at the same time, at least for most consoles, I think, except for the Wii and the PlayStation 2, generally speaking, console manufacturers always take a hit on consoles, and it's kind of like a stop-loss kind of thing, where they tend to make all their money through the licensing fees on the games, right?
2439756	2441077	They just don't... They don't...
2465578	2465618	Um...
2488274	2496143	probably not, I hope not, at least for the sake of all those that only own the PlayStation 3, although they're going to have to
2496565	2499607	I can't remember if Spassinator is the one that plays Final Fantasy XI.
2499628	2502670	It was him or one of the other listeners that plays Final Fantasy XI a lot.
2502790	2505652	That made me think that Final Fantasy XIV is on its way to PlayStation 3.
2505692	2505972	God, I know.
2526369	2533016	There are some exclusives out there on the horizon, but is it going to be... Here's the thing with Sony.
2533376	2536680	It's been this way ever since the launch of the PS3 and even the PSP.
2537250	2538591	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2558268	2563593	And even with like the PSP, the PSP Go price, are they fucking crazy?
2563954	2565435	Let's put it out for $250.
2565555	2567877	Great, that's a perfect way not to sell any more consoles.
2568098	2570180	That PSP Go is going to fail like crazy.
2570720	2572202	But I don't know.
2572302	2579028	I think it's just they're really, they need to get smart and they need to figure out a way to gain ground now.
2579208	2582772	And yes, exclusives will help, but price drop will help even more.
2583206	2591273	If the PSP Go, I think, had a $99 price point on it like Dan had mentioned a while back, then I think they'd be selling like freaking hotcakes.
2592099	2592419	I agree.
2592820	2610437	And on top of that, looking at the construction of them, about what they took out, the machines themselves can't really be relatively that expensive to produce, nor can shipping and marketing costs really be that much if they've already got some momentum going with it.
2611077	2612599	So really, say that...
2615201	2621167	To cost ship and market each individual system, it costs them, say, 80 bucks.
2621808	2624430	Put it out for 125, you'll make tons of profit still.
2624971	2629936	Because you'll get more units out, and the more you mass produce them, the cheaper they are to produce.
2630516	2639860	We've got to move on with some more stories, and we will, but I want to say... My point is, that's simple economics, simple business, and Sony should know that.
2640561	2647644	If they want to get the games, if they want to keep some of their people, if they want to sell the systems, that's the way to do it.
2649091	2657535	I think one place that Sony is losing to Microsoft, as much as I do enjoy my PlayStation 3, is that they are not staying current as fast as Microsoft does.
2657975	2660096	And that is killing them this generation.
2660516	2667540	Because Microsoft had a hard time doing that with the original Xbox, but right now they built that 360 to get these upgrades and all these things.
2668140	2669620	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2697327	2699148	to the PlayStation outside of home.
2701249	2704131	And some would argue home was not all it was cracked up to be.
2704651	2707813	It's definitely not the big hub that they thought it would be.
2707973	2710955	It's kind of a neat thing to play around with, but yeah.
2711556	2714719	Alright, well, I'm sure this story is to be continued.
2714779	2720383	It'll be interesting to see how long this whole little stalemate lasts.
2720984	2728029	Well, speaking of PlayStation, the PSP Go has an interesting rumor kind of related to it.
2728490	2738558	Apparently, there's a rumor that Sony is working on an app store for the PSP Go, and that's going to be revealed at Gamescom in Cologne this August.
2739578	2750726	and they're basically saying that these games will be limited to like 100 megs and basically that's only the limit for the content.
2751266	2758411	But any apps that they want to create including non-game applications may also be available as well.
2759031	2768778	So some of these smaller programs at cheaper prices or maybe free kind of aligning themselves with what Apple has with their app store.
2769458	2772401	It'd be interesting if this is going to be the draw for the PSP Go.
2775664	2791537	It makes sense to me that they're going to do something like this, because really, this has to be the only thing that they've got in the cards for, because what would be the draw to the PSP Go if basically all the games are just digital downloads now?
2792631	2793852	and the system's more expensive.
2794192	2797495	You need something unique to it to draw people to pay that extra $100.
2798916	2801719	I kind of thought this already existed.
2801859	2811888	Not so much a storefront on the PSP, but I thought your PS3 store was supposed to interact with the PSP as well as you could get something like this on your PC.
2812528	2813629	It's not necessarily...
2815748	2816209	Thanks for watching!
2836852	2837793	Well, it's an iPhone store.
2837813	2840076	Are they going to sell music and movies on it, too?
2841177	2844941	Well, they already do on the PlayStation Network, so... I guess that's true.
2845842	2850047	You can get it on your PSP, but I would bet you they ain't doing half the business Apple is.
2850547	2850767	Nope.
2851417	2852278	Thanks for watching!
2871211	2872232	and they're like, whatever.
2872252	2875936	I have a cell phone contract with my company right now or whatever.
2876376	2881401	It's kind of an inevitable part about doing business with a phone company in this day and age which is too bad in some ways.
2883083	2886486	I'm probably not going to do my upgrade though for some time.
2887193	2889035	No, I mean, I'm already an iPhone user.
2889135	2891337	The 3GS does not seem to have enough.
2892458	2898964	Especially, I would have to pay extra money because I'm not eligible for upgrade yet, which is AT&T's problem.
2899324	2900085	Actually, no.
2900926	2904029	They took away that thing where...
2904600	2906821	Yeah, you still have to be in a certain window, though, that I'm not in.
2907842	2909023	But I've got an old iPhone.
2910063	2918328	So for me, it makes perfect sense to upgrade it, although I'm not going to do it until about a month from now, but still.
2918889	2920109	Wait for them to work all the bugs out of it.
2920250	2922851	Yeah, if you're still on the very, very old one, I can see why.
2922891	2927974	But I'm on a 3G, and there's just not enough about 3GS that really... Yeah, battery life, yes.
2928014	2931576	I'm down for the faster processor myself and having a better camera on it.
2933318	2933878	Well, um...
2935242	2935642	Let's see.
2936924	2939907	Yeah, I don't know about this whole PSP store thing.
2939947	2944211	I guess it's a good idea, but I kind of think it's like kind of in a way it's too late.
2944331	2946953	But I guess there's a lot of people that don't have nor want the iPhone.
2947314	2954901	And again, I have to think about that college kid audience that seems to be the PSP target audience that really has these things.
2954921	2957303	Here's the other thing too, the college kid audience.
2958064	2965126	If you really want to, you can mod your PSP and there's the homebrew community that's already done this and has been doing this for years now.
2965246	2970228	So why bother paying for something that you can get for free and it'll probably end up being better anyways.
2971188	2978391	And seriously, if the PSP Go does take off, then those PSP 2000s and 3000s are going to be even cheaper.
2978751	2981112	You might as well do the 2000 because the screen isn't...
2982059	2982780	Space Invaders Extreme
2999787	3002129	Honestly, at this point, probably not.
3002269	3004751	But that's because I'm not a fan of handheld gaming in the first place.
3004771	3011555	And I've gone into this rant on a previous show, and I realize this is a personal preference that makes me weird than a lot of other gamers.
3012036	3013637	I do not like playing portable games.
3013977	3022523	The only place I can play a portable game is at the airport, on an airplane, when I'm on a trip and don't have my consoles with me, and I have to play something.
3022803	3023624	But if I'm at home...
3024344	3042885	I would not be caught dead with the DS in my own home playing in my house when I have a Playstation and all this other stuff readily available to play well if I want to play a particular game if I've got the system for it I'll just play it on whatever system it's on if I want to play Cooking Mama I'll play the good version on the DS which I've been known to do
3044356	3064942	for me to go that far there's so many games out there it's kind of like there's lots of games I want to play and I'll just play the ones I want to play on the console while I'm at home and again I know I'm weird but a game on the handhelds has to be really good and really anticipated for me to play them when I'm in house Scribblenuts
3067352	3072659	I'll probably end up picking it up for when I do travel, but I don't see myself sitting in my bed playing it.
3072759	3073741	I know I'm weird like that.
3073841	3074181	I don't know.
3074322	3075003	I can't explain it.
3076284	3077346	Do you play games on your iPhone?
3078648	3078808	Um...
3080100	3080400	DarkSakura.com
3098231	3099052	There's all the time, though.
3099072	3109285	I sit here when I'm chatting with people online, and I'm playing Vi right now, which was an old NES RPG that they put out on my phone.
3109305	3110026	I've been playing that.
3111848	3112369	All right, so anyhow.
3113147	3113747	Yeah, I know.
3114107	3116488	I know I'm weird about the whole handheld thing, but sorry.
3116528	3118769	I got off the original topic about the PSP App Store.
3119169	3120549	I guess it's an inevitable thing.
3120829	3124070	How successful it'll be, I guess it all depends what apps are on it.
3124210	3128112	If it has the must-have apps, but I don't see a lot of people just downloading it for the calculator.
3128132	3128792	Let's just put it this way.
3128832	3132253	Let's look at what other people have done, like the DSi Store.
3132533	3133313	Their apps suck.
3133773	3134013	All right.
3134274	3134974	Let's go to the phones.
3135014	3135954	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
3135994	3136354	Who's this?
3137495	3138255	Hey, what's up, everybody?
3138275	3138995	This is Kajudo.
3139455	3140736	Hey, Kajudo.
3140756	3140816	Hey.
3142700	3143660	All right.
3144261	3145901	Well, hey, welcome to the show.
3145961	3152284	What do you think about this whole PSP store and the PSP competing with the iPhone in a way?
3153484	3157746	Well, I don't own any of the PSPs just because it just never appealed to me.
3157806	3161048	I'm more of a DS fan where I like the innovation.
3161748	3164409	They just seem to build games for that system.
3164449	3169351	The PSP to me just seems like, okay, you want to take your PS3 or your PlayStation 2 in the car.
3169946	3170566	You can have that.
3170926	3174807	And really, I'm not interested in playing those types of games in my car.
3175147	3175407	You know?
3175747	3178128	I'd rather just a little simple point-and-click type game.
3178368	3181809	But what I'm concerned about is this, uh, what is it?
3182489	3183369	The PSP Go?
3184989	3185749	Mm-hmm, PSP Go.
3185769	3193291	Alright, what happens if I install these games on the PSP Go and I get my PSP stolen or I lose it?
3193351	3197172	That's like all my games are just basically down the drain now, right?
3198050	3204535	They're tied to your PlayStation Network accounts just like if your PS3 got stolen or exploded or something.
3205516	3206577	So you can re-download them again.
3208058	3208339	Oh, okay.
3208379	3209139	I didn't know that.
3209219	3215425	I thought it was something where you buy it off of their online store and it's saved on there and if you lose it then that's just...
3216024	3216444	No problem.
3216785	3221229	Well, that's certainly a valid concern, especially when you go to this whole digital distribution.
3221269	3225834	But yeah, I know on PlayStation Network, I mean, I don't buy anything for the PSP.
3225914	3228597	Well, it's the same deal.
3228737	3232020	Once you buy something, it's yours and you can re-download it later if you need to.
3232581	3238827	But isn't there like a thing like there's got to be a way to prevent me from going to a friend's house and downloading the game and they play it?
3239247	3242830	What if that service, for some reason, one day they no longer provide that download?
3242850	3246633	That's always another concern with me with things like, what is it, Valve?
3246853	3247693	Steam, Steam.
3247753	3248854	I'm a little concerned with that, like,
3263584	3265484	What happens if one day Steam just goes away?
3265504	3266905	Where does my games go?
3267185	3271226	Then they go into oblivion, unfortunately, unless you have them downloaded to your system.
3271566	3282768	Well, I would think, I would hope the respectable thing to do would be to release, if your company's about to go under, release something that's going to require, not require Steam anymore for that.
3282988	3291830	Yes, that or the other option, too, if you know that they're going to, you know, granted, I don't think the Sony store is just going to up and die all of a sudden, but, I mean, if you...
3292745	3293886	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
3312402	3336517	Bobby Blackwolf in chat would like to clarify Steam has a failsafe for that reason they've already stated that if they go under they will remove the digital rights management so it's kind of like I speculated that they would do the right thing and just disable the necessity of having Steam in the first place well hey thank you so much for the call and we appreciate it I just have one game recommendation for Loki you must get Red Faction Guerrilla I have it I just haven't played it yet
3337403	3337823	DarkSakura.com
3356531	3358373	I was like, oh yeah, I really gotta play that game.
3358433	3360595	And I also have Prototype 2, so I have to go back to that.
3360615	3362616	And Fuel, I have to go play that.
3362676	3366219	So there's a lot of stuff, and I just got my... I'm trying to unpack right now.
3366239	3367540	Now is just not a good time to move.
3367881	3368681	It's not.
3368741	3369582	I have to unpack.
3370743	3373085	The summer's dead for me as far as what's coming out.
3373205	3376888	So it's a good time to get all these games now, because then I can play them through the summer.
3377909	3379150	Alright, well thank you so much for the call.
3379170	3379551	Enjoy the show.
3379591	3379971	Good night, guys.
3379991	3380732	Alright, take care, buddy.
3381681	3381921	1-877-GAME-OLR
3403760	3409163	I thought that the rumor was actually that it was going to be treated like a console launch and people thought that it was going to be a new console.
3409183	3410203	That's what I thought too.
3410604	3421229	But also the fact that it was going to be not so much like a new console console, but you know how PlayStation 1 and then there's PlayStation 1 Slim a couple years later.
3421589	3423530	I think the thought was there was going to be an Xbox 360 Slim.
3425311	3440636	Well, the CEO of Microsoft, Steve Ballmer, actually came out and said that... Well, I'm sorry, that actually, he was the guy that made that first remark about the whole Xbox 360 hardware integration that caused everybody to run with everything going on here.
3442409	3452113	The director of product management for Xbox 360 and Xbox Live, Aaron Greenberg, actually straight up told Kotaku earlier this week, there will be no console.
3452453	3454774	We're not going to be launching a new console anytime soon.
3455094	3457415	I really believe he was speaking about Project Natal.
3457855	3462917	We want to make sure people know that we're excited about Project Natal, but we're barely halfway through this generation.
3463177	3466558	We're happy with the Xbox 360, so there are no changes from that standpoint.
3466819	3470420	For the time being, we're really just showing a whole new category of gaming.
3471489	3477716	And then they're talking about, are they thinking about doing the hands-free stuff in a new Xbox 360 configuration?
3478077	3483323	They did say, yes, we have looked at that, but we haven't announced any details for something like that.
3483343	3486726	I think they're just really kind of lying by omission, basically.
3487427	3488729	I think that's exactly what they're doing.
3488909	3490511	I think there is.
3491572	3492012	In a way...
3493893	3496714	Here's the most important quotes from this.
3497235	3502878	We are saying that the Natal will run on the Xbox 360, so there's no new hardware to purchase.
3503539	3516247	What we're doing that's unique is instead of asking you to invest in a new generation of hardware, a generation that's already well established, extending the experience even longer by adding this whole new category of experiences with Project Natal.
3516647	3519969	We're changing the rules just a little bit like we did with the new Xbox experiences.
3520109	3522832	It's just going to be, they're going to do a new console.
3522892	3529197	It may be slimmed down, it may not be slimmed down, but it's going to be some sort of a new revision and it's going to have Natal with it.
3529238	3530439	And that's basically it.
3530579	3536364	It may be integrated into it if they decide to actually slim down the form factor of it, but there will be a new console.
3536524	3542690	There will not be a new console because it's not going to be the Xbox, you know, the next one, the 720 or whatever you want to call it.
3543311	3552707	It won't be a new console in that sense, but just like how the PlayStation 2, spelled out T-W-O, is not a new console, it's just a slimmer console.
3552867	3554871	It's the same console, but just...
3555785	3557587	You've noticed the way he's wording it.
3557647	3558788	He's not saying no.
3559328	3560309	He's not saying no.
3560689	3565693	He's reassuring people that they're not going to have to buy a new console to enjoy Project Natal.
3566174	3569497	He didn't come out and say, we're not releasing a new set of hardware.
3569817	3570838	He didn't really say that.
3571178	3574361	He said, don't worry, Project Natal will work on your existing hardware.
3574621	3575402	That's what I'm hearing.
3576351	3579732	He's reassuring people that they don't need to do this hardware upgrade.
3580052	3585014	But I still think there's going to be... There has to be some perks to doing an upgrade.
3585514	3588175	I think there will be at least a bundle that comes with Natal.
3588195	3589595	I think they're really going to push this thing.
3589635	3590336	Why shouldn't they?
3591236	3592997	It is their answer to the Wii after all.
3593217	3598078	It's going to be kind of... They're going to treat it like a new launch, so why not relaunch the system?
3598098	3599479	See, because that's what they're going to do.
3599499	3601379	They're even going to probably phrase it like that.
3601399	3601820	This is...
3603188	3604088	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3626653	3629776	But in reality, they did go back and pump up the hardware a little bit.
3630336	3636742	Because remember, you couldn't really have NXE on your system if you didn't have a hard drive or a memory card or something.
3637083	3640145	If you had no memory, you can't even store NXE.
3640566	3651896	But now there's hardware out there that they've doubled the memory that it's now 512 megs built in that can fit NXE and probably some of the other stuff on your actual physical drive.
3652677	3652917	So...
3654420	3655902	And they've gotten rid of their arcade games.
3656062	3658305	This kind of confl... Well, that's true too.
3658585	3661128	But this kind of conflicts with what he's saying.
3661268	3662410	I knew this was coming a long time.
3663231	3663791	Actually, it's funny.
3663871	3665293	I remember you saying something on the show.
3665313	3665914	Yes, I did.
3666254	3668717	And they were slowly transitioning.
3668797	3673643	It was the console that they had the holiday bundles that they can do with the games packed in.
3673903	3674443	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
3698904	3707426	I hope that they do make a slimmer one.
3708387	3713528	I could be talked into upgrading my system, actually, because I still have my old-ass Xbox 360.
3713968	3721890	I could be talked into it for HDMI, quieter system, and maybe any other perks they're going to throw at me with new hardware.
3722150	3732334	It would be quieter because of the smaller chipsets, less heat, less need for a huge fan.
3732554	3733394	But here's my concern.
3733434	3735035	My old hard drive's not going to work with it.
3735435	3738296	Because if they slim down the system, that massive drive's not going to fit on it.
3738696	3739237	No, they could.
3739777	3743058	It'd be the same thickness, or maybe a plug-in to the top.
3743518	3743978	They could do it.
3744479	3744839	Interesting.
3744959	3745479	I hope they do.
3745719	3746139	I hope they do.
3746199	3749300	Because I wouldn't want to have to get a new drive and all that stuff again.
3749360	3750121	That would turn me off.
3750421	3750781	We'll see.
3752927	3753849	I would think that they would.
3753869	3756775	I mean, look at the PlayStation Slim.
3756855	3759100	I mean, all the peripherals, for the most part, work with it.
3759160	3761745	I mean, there's obviously... The multi-tap doesn't, but...
3765234	3769715	Other interesting things, going back to talking about Activision again.
3770855	3779397	Activision, I guess the prices for their new peripheral games are actually starting to come out online.
3780597	3785518	Retailers like Amazon and GameStop and stuff like that are starting to take pre-orders on them.
3785578	3787779	People are kind of shocked at how expensive they are.
3788399	3788579	Now,
3789451	3790956	This is Activision we're talking about here.
3791116	3792781	I'm not shocked at how expensive they are.
3793002	3794928	But it is interesting, though.
3795088	3795971	Like, for example...
3797918	3821567	DJ Hero I think we talked about this a little bit before it's going to retail for $120 and it's of course bundled in with the DJ controller which when you look at like previously releases like say Guitar Hero with a guitar bundled with it that's typically been $99.99 for an Xbox 360 or Playstation 3 version the Playstation 2 version though is coming out at $99.99 so there is like a $30 premium on all these different
3826909	3827950	BAND HERO
3848562	3849463	Guitar Hero Game
3862520	3864001	DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
3880748	3881368	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
3906960	3908741	So maybe they think they're justified in that sense.
3909561	3911983	Okay, well, what's Band Hero bringing new to the table?
3912303	3914624	I can tell you what Beatles rock band is bringing new to the table.
3915305	3917306	But what is... Well, I don't know.
3917346	3918887	Some folks might want to argue with me on that.
3918927	3929933	But at the same time, I'm telling you, put the Beatles rock band gameplay next to Guitar Hero Van Halen gameplay, and I'll tell you what justifies that premium Beatles prize.
3929953	3930693	You know what I mean?
3930913	3932754	Here's something funny, though, if you think about it.
3932975	3933195	Okay?
3934298	3939402	Guitar Hero World Tour right now I think is like $180 if I remember correctly.
3939422	3940683	I think it's like $179.99.
3941163	3943665	In fact, I'm going to look that up right now.
3944265	3952871	But let's just assume with Guitar Hero 5 coming out, you've got to think that they're probably going to do a price drop on Guitar Hero World Tour.
3953372	3957595	Because they've got to clear out the extra units that they have and maybe they're not going to do it right away.
3957635	3957755	But
3958275	3960736	You would think that they were going to drop it because that's what they normally do.
3960776	3965839	They drop the version that came out last year in preparation for the new one.
3966299	3970261	So you've got the bundles that are available out there right now for World Tour.
3970701	3975603	And say that you can get them for, I don't know, $150, $149.99.
3976564	3978825	I'm sure that's not too much of a stretch.
3980345	3985308	Okay, so now you have this new game coming out for $200 worldwide.
3987415	3996641	Why should I buy that bundle when I can buy a bundle with World Tour and I can buy the game only of Band Hero for the same price as buying the bundle for Band Hero?
3996981	3998322	It makes no sense whatsoever.
3999262	4001144	So, I don't know.
4001404	4012991	I mean, it does seem kind of a rip-off to be spending that kind of money on a bundle that is readily available right now for a cheaper price.
4014632	4016113	And yeah, it looks like World Tour...
4017520	4029778	The Band Kits Okay, $190 So they're still pretty expensive Um Actually $190 Right now that wouldn't be that But that's still $10 more than, you know Yeah
4031021	4034322	But, you know, for $10, even $10 is $10 still.
4034643	4034863	Yeah.
4035423	4039044	Especially considering, you know, they're not bringing that much new to the table, it sounds like.
4039465	4040765	But here's my thing.
4040825	4045307	I'm going back to the DJ Hero thing for a minute because I'm excited about DJ Hero.
4045327	4046988	It looks like the game's going to be pretty cool.
4048108	4049369	The song list looks pretty awesome.
4049409	4051750	It looks innovative and this whole thing.
4052490	4055251	But when I heard it was $120, it was like getting kicked in the crotch.
4055752	4055932	Like...
4058274	4060376	$120 is a lot of money.
4060656	4064921	I'll tell you what, if they had said $99, I would have been like, sold, gonna buy it, I'm there.
4065502	4066643	Yep, I got it, day one.
4067804	4071068	But it's that third digit that makes all the difference in my mind.
4073070	4074390	I don't know what it is.
4074430	4075371	I'm very disappointed.
4089525	4118360	I like to travel with my game consoles and peripherals and stuff like that, so that, you know, would appeal to me, but I want to see what I'm getting for this $120, because it's kind of expensive for, you know, and I know the peripheral is kind of neat, but I'm sorry, it's a turntable, it can't be that sophisticated, it's, we've had Beatmania controllers out there, and I mean, really, we're not talking too much different than that, and hell, the guitars aren't even that sophisticated, so...
4120532	4121473	Where's the money going?
4122694	4124716	Yeah, I'm curious about that too.
4125296	4128799	And I think what also really sucks is that you can't really demo DJ Hero.
4128859	4129380	You know what I mean?
4129720	4134524	You're going to have to either play it in a store, play it at a friend's, or take a chance.
4134764	4136226	And you want to hear something funny?
4137286	4144673	This is coming from a company that's bitching about the price being too high for the PlayStation 3.
4145854	4146154	Funny.
4146234	4147235	I didn't even think about that.
4147575	4148356	You're absolutely right.
4150233	4151974	Oh, the PlayStation 3 is too high.
4152514	4156215	Hell, that's almost the price of our, what is it, Band Hero.
4156235	4162336	If they drop the PlayStation 3 price another $100, it will be the price of their Band Hero bundle.
4164397	4165977	I'm sorry, that seems kind of a rip-off to me.
4169518	4170799	But, at the same time...
4172637	4173437	Band Hero was Band Hero
4196568	4198149	And I do a show about games every week.
4198189	4199370	I'm supposed to be on top of this stuff.
4199750	4202232	I literally thought Guitar Hero 5 was just called Band Hero.
4202392	4203133	I thought that's what it was.
4203333	4204093	It was the same game.
4204534	4206135	I was like, no, they're putting out two?
4206815	4207076	Really?
4207736	4208376	Do we need that?
4209577	4212299	Well, okay, Van Halen's coming out at the beginning of August.
4212639	4215021	Guitar Hero 5's coming out at the beginning of September.
4215702	4218063	Band Hero's coming out in October.
4219204	4219845	That's too much.
4221005	4221566	That is a lot.
4222509	4224710	I don't know why I'm... Yeah, I don't know.
4224750	4225331	I'm not feeling it.
4225431	4229613	Especially, you know, they're going to charge like 50 bucks for Guitar Hero Van Halen.
4229813	4230273	It's too much.
4230894	4231054	Yep.
4231194	4231494	Too much.
4232074	4234255	Alright, well, I guess that's them.
4234636	4238277	We'll see how this sells, of course, and how you guys anticipate it.
4238358	4238998	Not a lot of chat.
4239018	4240359	They're talking about pay goal in the chat room.
4240739	4243600	I guess there's not a lot of care about DJ Hero or Band Hero.
4243640	4244021	I don't know.
4244741	4245962	Alright, well, that's what it is.
4246302	4248383	Let's shift topics and talk about another game.
4250001	4254585	This game definitely has its cult following, which used to be me many years ago.
4255465	4256486	Magic the Gathering.
4257307	4257927	Hey, hey, hey.
4259628	4262791	That was me in college in Alabama.
4263348	4281012	and it was me in high school many years ago actually I've actually got a couple magic decks over here I got them for free here's the thing about Magic the Gathering say what you will call me whatever name you want in the book I do think Magic the Gathering is actually a lot of fun it's just a good game like I think it's a good card game to play but
4283018	4283638	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4304912	4305792	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
4327399	4329680	I guess, yeah.
4329840	4332281	In the full version of the game, you can kind of make your own deck.
4332601	4339643	You can do your own thing with it, you know, and add the cards that are there, and you gain and lose cards as you fight enemies and so forth.
4340844	4344265	So yeah, it's hard for me, and like Lazy Days in chat says, demos don't count.
4344325	4348806	Yes, I don't want to base my evaluation of the game off of it, so I'm not going to tell you whether to buy it or not.
4348846	4354028	I will just say, you know, it was kind of neat to see a resurgence of Magic the Gathering.
4354488	4355209	Magic the Gathering
4370711	4373732	You have the card, good old card and table and all that stuff.
4374253	4376054	Or you have Magic the Gathering Online.
4376954	4385698	The interesting thing about Magic the Gathering Online, they have really tried to mirror the card playing experience right on down to what you pay for it.
4387179	4391201	If you weren't aware, if you want to play Magic the Gathering Online, it's essentially free.
4391681	4392301	You have to pay $10.
4393101	4394082	I did a little research today.
4394122	4396883	I've never played Magic the Gathering Online, but I did some research.
4396943	4398304	If I wanted to play, what would it take?
4399502	4405445	You pay like a $10 registration fee, but that $10 goes towards a coupon that you use in their store.
4406465	4410247	And you buy decks just like walking into a comic book store and buying a deck.
4410607	4416811	You buy booster packs just like you would buy a booster pack in a store of 12 random cards or what have you.
4417551	4419832	And it's the same price with tax and all that stuff.
4420212	4422233	So you literally, but they make it very clear.
4422934	4423534	There is no...

4458918	4484670	um and this is from an interview on destructoid.com senior brand manager worth woolport actually was quoted saying a good way to think of it is like the old theme decks or our current intro decks it's that kind of option to add on to your gaming experience and it's all set it's not randomized at all by the way they're also going to have themes play mats like the background you can buy yeah and gamer pictures okay but at
4485991	4488192	But what about for the people that's over it?
4488252	4491993	I mean, what appeal is it going to have for all the people who've moved on?
4493193	4495133	Is there anything that's going to bring anyone back?
4495593	4498614	What about the face-to-face playing with somebody?
4499354	4500255	Well, I don't know.
4500975	4508697	Actually, to be honest, Jamie, I think this is it to bring the old people back is that you don't have to put up with the boosters and all these extra little costs here.
4508857	4513358	In a way, I think if I was going to play Magic the Gathering more regularly, this is appealing to me.
4513649	4524615	When I played Magic regularly, I loved being able to collect all the rare cards and to have the collection that other people went, ooh.
4524635	4531859	But wouldn't it bug you when someone, when you were playing, would pull out that effing card that is so rare there's no way in hell you're going to get it?
4532219	4534301	You know, that type of thing, and then it's being used in a match.
4534621	4539304	I mean, one thing you can say about the Microsoft way of doing it on Xbox Live, everybody's on the same page.
4539524	4540545	Everybody's on equal footing.
4540725	4541926	See, that's not fun to me.
4542086	4548850	If I wanted to play, you know, a certain type of match, you know, I would say, hey, do you have a Type 2 deck?
4548870	4549831	Do you have a Type 1 deck?
4550331	4552032	You know, do you have old school Type 1?
4552072	4553113	I don't even know what that means.
4553173	4553573	That's funny.
4553733	4554574	That's for tournament.
4554594	4555555	I used to do tournament play.
4556747	4557208	Back in the day.
4557708	4562851	And I just say like, hey, you know, if you've got this type of deck, then we'll play this kind of game.
4563312	4567835	If you want to bring out the strong stuff, you know, we would actually set up those parameters first.
4568295	4572578	So it was a much broader scope of play if you had this together.
4572698	4578542	I've seen people take out wimpy ass starter pack decks and beat people with, you know...
4579122	4584610	The Hardcore Expensive Deck Just Because They Were A Better Player Not Everyone Is Going To Be Equal
4596055	4601139	You may be able to match the cards for everybody, but you're never going to match the skill.
4601760	4605964	And I think that that really takes away a lot of the experience and play.
4606064	4608406	Well, from what I understand, you still build your own deck.
4608686	4611108	It's just that everybody has the same card pool to build from.
4611308	4611989	And yeah, okay.
4612409	4613871	You're a collector by nature, Jamie.
4614031	4615352	You collect video games.
4615692	4616553	You collect systems.
4616873	4618034	You collect lots of stuff.
4618395	4619556	You're a collector by nature.
4619736	4620777	I can see your argument.
4621257	4621637	For me...
4622520	4623341	That's too much money.
4624802	4625483	I can't do it.
4625863	4626504	I will tell you.
4627224	4628746	I spent a lot of money on this as a kid.
4628906	4629827	My first collection.
4631308	4632790	That's right, you were a kid, weren't you?
4634772	4635552	I was playing in college.
4636353	4638055	I wasn't that far behind you.
4638095	4640317	I was playing this when I was a sophomore, junior in high school.
4640337	4641418	You were what, two years older than me?
4641718	4644240	So right around the same there.
4644741	4645562	Loki was a child.
4646192	4647772	Just kidding, I was not a child.
4648272	4660055	But the whole thing is that I actually built up a collection, sold it for about $1,500 of D&D books, which I still have, and then promptly rebuilt my collection.
4660755	4663756	Just because, you know, it's its own currency.
4663776	4665777	You have to be smart with the building and trading.
4666597	4670098	And, you know, my last collection, by that time, I didn't care anymore.
4670118	4671678	Nobody wanted to pay what it was worth.
4672678	4674579	But still, it's a matter of...
4676279	4677100	What are you in it for?
4679161	4683285	For a lot of people, the fun comes not just in the playing, but in the having.
4684686	4686267	Our good friend Marissa is in chat.
4686307	4689669	Marissa Congusto says, I was in elementary school for the win.
4690770	4694873	Don't I feel like grandpa?
4694973	4695914	We do love Marissa, though.
4696394	4698036	And we want her to come visit the show, by the way.
4698536	4699597	Marissa!
4699617	4699757	Marissa!
4700712	4702513	or Jamie and I are just going to have to end up in L.A.
4702533	4703634	the same weekend and make that happen.
4704014	4706996	All right, and Loki somehow is going to have to be talked into making the trip.
4707837	4708177	Let's see.
4708677	4724367	I do want to say, though, what else I thought was interesting about this whole Magic the Gathering story was that they also, in this interview, the brand manager would not really say how much it's going to cost because he says, as far as price, all that stuff is dictated by Microsoft.
4724827	4725448	Thank you for watching!
4745310	4751515	What some people have spent lots more money on another online gaming platform to have.
4752276	4753437	That's fascinating to me.
4753497	4754077	I don't know why.
4754718	4755659	Maybe I'm just weird.
4756019	4757260	Maybe it's the memories I have.
4757360	4761503	I'm sure they would have done booster packs and stuff if they had a way to do random cards like that.
4761644	4769270	But because it's pay X amount of points, download this data, done.
4769390	4771992	It's just... I don't know.
4773353	4774094	You can't do it.
4776827	4798352	for them I do want to check out the full version of the game though I think I will probably as soon as I finish up some of this Final Fantasy and other stuff I've been playing I'll probably get a little more into Magic the Gathering and I would love to play Jamie on Xbox Live but I don't know if she'll want to spend the 10 bucks it might be fun though it really has been years me too I have two decks here on my desk Rob
4800993	4805755	When I was going through that tutorial, I was like, oh my god, this is almost too much to remember.
4806195	4808936	Wait, I have to hit a button to interrupt if I want to actually use this?
4809396	4810697	So, oh my gosh, she really does.
4810717	4811497	She just whipped it out.
4811997	4813938	It's a sealed deck, for god's sake.
4815078	4816119	I challenge you, Rob.
4816319	4819220	Ready to play 30-card deck and quick start guide.
4819720	4821100	For real, these are two starter decks?
4821240	4821961	Two starter decks.
4822601	4823481	I challenge you, Rob.
4823501	4825002	We should have a battle on this show.
4826530	4827971	Not right now.
4827991	4829732	Maybe it's a special one-off show or something.
4829752	4833594	We have a white deck and a green deck, which means it'll be a fucking long game.
4835935	4838617	We should do this as a special spin-off show or something.
4838897	4840918	And maybe Loki can provide commentary.
4841578	4843499	I don't know what the hell's going on, nor do I care.
4843619	4845180	That would be what was funny about it.
4845480	4848022	If this has that phasing bullshit in it, though, I'm out.
4849352	4850273	What the hell is phasing?
4850293	4851413	I don't even know what that is.
4851453	4859599	Actually, I stopped playing when they put in phasing, which means one card is in play for one turn, and then you have to skip the next one with that card, so they phase.
4860219	4860680	Bullshit.
4861780	4862061	Weird.
4862581	4863301	I'm sorry, Rob.
4863361	4864863	My deck was black-red.
4866123	4871187	I would spawn thralls and throw fireballs, and people hated it.
4872478	4873599	This battle is happening.
4873779	4874639	This must happen.
4875019	4875859	You've got the white deck.
4875879	4876579	I've got the green deck.
4876659	4876880	Fine.
4876920	4877220	Whatever.
4877280	4877620	I don't care.
4877680	4879260	Well, you're holding the white deck, so I'm just saying.
4880081	4880821	We need to set a time.
4880921	4881641	Sealed deck tourney.
4881821	4882021	Alright.
4882041	4882841	Sealed deck tourney.
4882861	4883762	Between you and me.
4885222	4886462	And I haven't played in years.
4886542	4889103	Neither have I. And they are sealed.
4889183	4890224	Completely sealed.
4890364	4894685	I will take a picture and put it on the website so that you can see that they're sealed.
4895125	4897946	How about we do this on... What are you doing on Wednesday, Robb?
4898871	4901659	I have to check with the significant other, but I think I will be free.
4902983	4904167	Bring the significant other.
4904247	4904688	It's on.
4905287	4907689	He's going to think it's the dumbest thing you've ever seen in your life.
4907709	4909770	We're going to get sandwiches and beer.
4910571	4911231	No, not beer.
4911611	4914593	We're going to get sandwiches and lemonade and play Magic.
4914753	4919737	If this weekend wasn't birthday slash pride slash whatever, I would say let's do it this weekend.
4919977	4921798	And then you're going to Las Vegas the next week, huh?
4922158	4922258	Yeah.
4922278	4923019	So you're going to be gone.
4923739	4925100	All right, we'll make it happen.
4925120	4926361	We'll figure something out behind the scenes.
4927222	4928422	This is going to be.
4929323	4930044	It will be.
4930364	4930604	All right.
4931424	4935047	And, of course, the chat is very supportive of the whole Magic the Gathering sealed deck tournament.
4937083	4938544	We should turn it into a drinking game.
4939145	4940286	We've got the geekery.
4940486	4942908	Instead of 20 life points, we should have 20 shot glasses.
4942928	4945149	God, Rob, this is so fucking ridiculous.
4945250	4947872	Especially since... How would you get your life back?
4948892	4949993	You just... I don't know.
4950213	4953676	Especially since I haven't really wanted to play Magic in forever.
4953816	4955457	I just got the decks because they were freaking free.
4956018	4958580	I thought I'd give them to somebody or we'd give them away on the show.
4959020	4959921	How about this?
4960581	4963704	How about the winning deck is a giveaway?
4963724	4963804	Okay.
4964400	4964680	DarkSakura.com
4991570	4992671	A whole crap ton of stuff.
4993792	4996234	We have on the 23rd, Fallout 3 point lookout.
4996855	4999918	And then we've got on the 26th, a whole bunch of stuff.
5000038	5002300	Another code R, Journey into Lost Memories.
5004022	5006624	Arma 2, is that it?
5007485	5011389	Dynasty Warriors 6 Empires, Fight Night Round 4, Guitar Hero Greatest Hits.
5011909	5012409	Blah.
5013810	5021572	Monster Hunter Freedom Unite, Overlord 2, Overlord Dark Legends, Overlord Minions, and Prinny Can I Really Be a Hero?
5022872	5024853	And Superstars V8 Racing.
5027734	5029794	Cool.
5029974	5030614	Let's see.
5032175	5036036	In the US, we've actually got a little bit coming out this week.
5037076	5038897	Starting off, we've got...
5041139	5046283	Monster Hunter Freedom Unite Dynasty Warriors 6 Empires Transformers Revenge of the Fallen
5058272	5063034	Split up between Autobots and Decepticons to celebrate the new movie coming out this week.
5063914	5069236	My Healthy Cooking Coach for the DS and Enhanced for the DSi with lots of recipes.
5069296	5072257	In fact, you get some exclusive recipes if you have the DSi system.
5072317	5073618	That is such bullshit.
5074078	5074698	It is crap.
5074738	5075098	Yes, it is.
5075158	5075978	I am sorry.
5076178	5076939	That's Ubisoft.
5076979	5078379	You can thank Ubisoft for that.
5079600	5080000	Overlord.
5080020	5080160	Ubisoft.
5080640	5084344	Overlord 2 coming out on PS3 and Xbox 360.
5085265	5091131	Overlord Minions on DS and Overlord Dark Legend on the Wii.
5092352	5096056	And also this week, Resident Evil Archives.
5096917	5100260	That's going to be your first, I guess...
5101201	5102141	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
5131187	5133472	Discovery Kids Parrot Pals yet another
5134861	5136322	I don't know, SimGame.
5137422	5139884	I wonder if you can make the parrots repeat you in their parrot voice.
5139904	5140504	That'd be kind of funny.
5141785	5148528	The PlayStation 2 is getting a bundle of two of the PlayStation portable ports for Grand Theft Auto.
5149108	5153811	Liberty City Stories and Bite City Stories bundle coming out for $30 retail.
5153911	5154831	That's not too bad.
5156032	5158934	And on DS, some more schlock.
5159634	5162035	Fashion Week Junior Designer coming from 505 Games.
5164377	5171826	and Dawn of Discovery, a real-time strategy game that's coming out on the Wii and I believe the DS.
5176616	5180578	Classic Word Games, another one from Ubisoft, also enhanced for the DSi.
5182919	5183880	That's coming out on DS.
5183900	5186181	I just think that's a horrible thing to do to the casual audience.
5188442	5190503	Not that these are games I would ever buy anyway.
5190663	5193565	I just think that's a mean thing to do to the casual audience.
5194165	5197107	It's not like you're using the new hardware for this.
5198087	5199328	It's just plain and simple.
5199388	5203370	All the enhancements for that cooking game, it was 20 more recipes.
5203912	5208235	and you got to take your picture and put it in as the chef picture or something like that.
5208455	5210656	Now, if that was the main enhancement, then fine.
5210676	5215439	That is something that the DSi hardware can do that the DS just simply cannot do.
5215819	5220381	But this whole withholding recipes or mini-games or what have you just sucks.
5222242	5228126	Shimogane Tensei Devil Summoner on DS coming out this week and...
5230170	5235246	and lastly, Hanya Fantasy Golf on PSP will be making out this week.
5235889	5236932	And that is it.
5237915	5238876	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
5264651	5275215	Mamoru-kun wa Norowaerte Shimata comes out as well, which is a port from the arcades that...
5276172	5277592	Agarest Senki Zero Ideafactory
5304879	5312342	It kind of looks like a sim type of game mixed with a role-playing game, which could be kind of interesting.
5312462	5318123	But that is coming out over there on the PlayStation 3, as well as another version of BlazBlue.
5318884	5325226	And Fight Night Round 4 also making its way to the Asian region, so it pretty much matches the Xbox 360 dates pretty well.
5325246	5329507	But they also have one other game, Rorona no Atelier 3.
5330047	5353062	Arland no Renken Sushi comes out and that is on several different types of box sets and so forth and I do see that this guy is using like magical sushi in a role playing type of format there so I think that's got to be based on some other type of series over there the game looks very stylish though I will give it that it looks kind of neat
5354451	5357093	coming out on some other systems on the Nintendo Wii.
5358314	5362658	Wii Sports Resort, by the way, is coming out this week in Japan.
5362778	5364459	That's a pretty big deal.
5365020	5368723	So that is coming out in Japan, and that's really the only thing of note over there.
5369424	5373367	I'm going to skip past PlayStation 2 dates and go straight to the Nintendo DS.
5373827	5376650	Fushigi Yugi gets a game on the DS this week.
5377530	5379112	There's a Fushigi Yugi game?
5380293	5381153	On the DS this week.
5381414	5381814	Let me see it.
5384127	5386348	Bringing up some picture in studio to satisfy DarkSakura.
5386428	5387449	Oh, dear God.
5389010	5389510	There it is.
5389790	5392652	Oh, it looks like it's kind of a sim type.
5393253	5394113	Yeah, it definitely looks like a sim.
5394133	5395114	It's Tusky.
5395174	5398296	Fushugi Yugi is two romantic adventures combined into one DS card.
5398596	5403159	Become the Miko destined to save a nation from calamity and meet all the handsome bodyguards along the way.
5403539	5410844	The fans who have read the manga may already know who the heroines end up with, but now with you in the Miko's robes, you don't have to end things the way the anime or manga did.
5410864	5411064	Okay.
5411144	5411964	That sounds kind of fun.
5412024	5413025	Too bad I can't read any of it.
5413045	5416005	So it's kind of like reverse dating sim because now you get to date boys.
5417086	5421007	That'd be fun if that one got a release over here, but I doubt it.
5421127	5422847	And the game, I like the name of this game.
5422867	5424128	It's a game called Really?
5424568	5424908	Really?
5425348	5425728	DS.
5426508	5427289	That is the name of it.
5427589	5427869	Really?
5427969	5429169	Oh, really?
5430790	5432230	Maybe that'll be the American release.
5432290	5434711	Instead of about two girls, it'll be about an owl.
5435551	5437152	Although that would be a completely different game altogether.
5438252	5438412	Um...
5439580	5442702	Although, from what I understand, Scribblenauts has the O'Reilly Owl in it.
5442762	5443342	Sweet.
5444082	5445303	All the more reason to buy it.
5445623	5447064	Remember we told Bobby about it?
5447184	5447944	Oh no, you weren't there.
5448244	5450705	I told him to go try it the last day and I know he talked about it on his show.
5451025	5452446	And I told him, do lolcats.
5452546	5452986	It's funny.
5453266	5455548	And I guess he tried the O'Reilly Owl and it actually worked.
5455668	5456288	So there you go.
5457188	5468734	Quickly on the PSP, I want to mention Memories Off After Rain comes out as well as Noko Aozora Ni Yakisuko Tenohira no Rakuun comes out.
5471155	5474738	The cover art is this girl kneeling in the beach, reaching for your hand.
5475258	5476559	It's probably another dating sim.
5476659	5479641	Oh yeah, there's three people in bed together.
5479982	5480562	What is that?
5480982	5481803	No, it's probably a family.
5481863	5482824	That's hot.
5484085	5485165	It's not that hot.
5485205	5487087	It looks like a dating sim.
5487827	5488568	Alright, so there you go.
5490409	5493251	The best dating sims have three people in bed at once.
5494732	5497934	By the way, the Fushugi Yugi got a big rise out of the chat room.
5498015	5498235	What?
5498255	5498575	What?
5499522	5500223	Yes, indeed.
5500523	5500863	There it is.
5501244	5503866	Alright, hey, we're going to close out Part A and get into Part B tonight.
5504406	5509471	We just had a mention of the Tokimeki Memorial, which is like the big dating sim series.
5510211	5512193	And yeah, there is one for girls.
5512313	5514094	It's called Tokimeki Memorial Girlside.
5514455	5515656	I do believe it's called Girlside.
5516343	5517563	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5545808	5548209	DarkSakura is going to pick a game and share it with you all right now.
5548249	5549210	The classic game of the week.
5550510	5553912	This is a very interesting game called Silhouette Mirage.
5554772	5556453	And I'm surprised I haven't done this one before.
5556673	5559274	Actually, I think I haven't done it because I thought I had done it before.
5560035	5561175	So, cue music?
5561695	5562536	Yes, ma'am.
5562576	5564877	Here's some clip from Silhouette Mirage.
5565097	5571560	This is actually from the Saturn version, which is the one that I really want most of all.
5573397	5575278	It has really good music, by the way.
5575438	5576959	It's a game that's put out by Treasure.
5579100	5586324	And it was initially on the Sega Saturn and then had a PlayStation release.
5586684	5592927	Well, the Saturn Japanese release was in 1997 and then came out in 98 on PlayStation.
5592967	5596169	And then Working Designs brought out the PlayStation version.
5597110	5604901	Um, later, actually on, um, December 31st, 1999, which I have that version, and honestly, after playing the Saturn version, the Saturn version is better!
5605742	5609228	Um, but that's what happens with a lot of Saturn PlayStation conversions.
5610296	5620840	Anyway, you basically play through the game where you have different sorts of natures.
5620980	5623021	One is Silhouette, one is Mirage.
5624042	5631525	And so you actually play as a character that has both of those attributes.
5631625	5634546	I don't know if you can see in the movie file, Rob.
5635207	5636952	Yeah, she's like flipping from blue to red.
5637112	5639961	Yeah, when she moves one way, she's red, and when she moves the other, she's blue.
5639981	5640803	That's kind of interesting.
5641690	5658682	Well, it's very similar to Gunstar Heroes in how it plays, but you have to really make sure that you're the same type matches, which actually in the Japanese version you can't absorb it, but you can in the US one.
5659382	5665226	And then you also have to make sure that you're attacking with the opposite type of whatever the creature you're fighting is.
5666782	5668644	It's really, really difficult.
5668764	5669645	I mean, seriously.
5669685	5673729	But then again, treasure games are freaking difficult.
5674790	5684300	So basically, the main character is called Shina Nara Shina, which I thought they did something stupid to it in the U.S., so I'm not even going to bother with that.
5686442	5689725	So she's very little, and she has both...
5690726	5693268	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
5720666	5728929	You actually get beings that will help you out that are based off the seven deadly sins.
5730590	5730970	Sins.
5731530	5732610	You get Sloth.
5733471	5734331	You get Lusty.
5735015	5738397	Angry, Gluttony, Envy, Covetous and Pride
5755107	5761431	Some other things, you have the Reaper and Galoov bosses that are only in the PlayStation version.
5762972	5767955	And so they actually modified the story, added a new dialogue, new levels, another ending.
5769076	5775040	And they were intended for the Saturn version, but the rumor is that they rushed the Saturn version out and all that wasn't in it.
5777582	5783105	Also, they made it harder for the American version, which I'm saying it was really freaking hard.
5783626	5784066	They made it
5784526	5785387	Harder.
5786067	5787388	Seriously, harder.
5787929	5789630	What you're seeing there, Rob, is easy.
5791031	5791711	They made it hard.
5792432	5796394	I really suck at the PlayStation American one.
5797135	5798876	You also have a debug mode.
5798896	5803399	You have Super Core Fighter 2, which you can play between Shaina and Zohar, one of the other characters.
5805521	5807842	They also, of course, edited...
5810328	5821512	Some of the sprites in the game, like one of them, a character, a cigarette was replaced with a gloved hand, you know, instead of holding a cigarette.
5822332	5824813	And a burning cross was replaced with a dragon.
5826153	5829154	So, but that is classic treasure.
5831061	5834104	Another treasure to add to our pile in the classic game of the week.
5834124	5835405	But they did do some great games.
5837387	5852020	I mean, if you want to look at the things Treasure's given us, Gunstar Heroes, Doki Doki Mischief Makers, Bangayo, Ikaruga, Radiant Silvergun.
5853261	5853922	Seriously.
5854582	5857445	Treasure is like, they're aptly named.
5858155	5865438	Alright, well there you go, your classic game of the week, Silhouette Mirage, available on the Saturn, or if you were in for a challenge, the PlayStation.
5866258	5867979	So, there you go.
5870060	5880544	That's going to do it for this Part A of our show, but we've got plenty more show when we come back, including our Part B tonight.
5881184	5882545	We have the Rapid Fire News.
5883427	5892876	We have some other discussion topics we're going to get into and of course your emails at mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com We will be back right after a quick break with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
5892936	5893477	Stay tuned guys!
5899898	5907441	And welcome back, everybody, here on this lovely Sunday evening, June the 21st of 2009, for Part B of Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 328.
5907681	5913563	We tape live every week on allgames.com, available at radio.allgames.com.
5914183	5916744	And we put out our podcast every week as well.
5917424	5918164	Thanks for watching!
5939353	5941916	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5963775	5973500	In the same vein of Team Ninja, working with Nintendo to reimagine Metroid, what development group would you like to see partner and collaborate with Nintendo, and what franchise?
5973960	5979222	So basically, to make it short, dream developer, dream franchise, but a Nintendo franchise.
5979482	5986926	We're going to be getting into that a little later, and if you want to vote and participate in tonight's list list and have a say, chat.orangeloungeradio.com is the place to be.
5987546	5990348	Meanwhile, we're getting some rapid fire news.
5990928	5994951	Some topics that we're not going to talk a lot about, but we wanted to let you know what's going on anyway.
5995271	5997152	DarkSakura, what's the rapid fire news tonight?
5998133	6013823	Well, for our friends over in the UK, this is actually until July 3rd, you can get a gold subscription to Xbox Live for basically one pound.
6015404	6016525	And then, of course...
6018223	6021688	You know, afterwards, you can pay regular price if you want to keep it.
6022149	6024372	But seriously, one quid for one month, that's not bad.
6026475	6027417	Good way to get your foot in the door.
6028015	6030157	Pretty much, see how you like it.
6030317	6035660	Also, some games coming out, WiiWare and DSiWare.
6036181	6043065	We actually have Let's Catch, which is put out by Yuji Naka.
6043866	6049950	It's to go along with Let's Tap, so it's catching a game.
6050410	6058177	And then we have Ikarian Kindred Spirits, where you play as a little winged girl called Nyx who is trying to find Icarus.
6060179	6062441	Aren't we all trying to find the sequel to Icarus?
6064002	6068966	Nay, you know, it could... I don't know if it's tied in, but hey, if it is, that would be sweet.
6069807	6074611	And then DSiWare gets a game called A Little Bit of...
6076610	6079952	Dr. Kalashima's Brain Training, Maths Edition.
6080672	6082873	So, um, it's math.
6083613	6085614	Which means I won't be getting this freaking game.
6086115	6087575	It's 800 Nintendo points, by the way.
6089556	6093338	And then, last but not least, we have...
6094662	6123342	Mass Effect for iPhone which is a side story actually there was an NDA leak that came out last month one of the testers blurted out all this crap so basically it's not a bridging story it's just a little side story about one of the Mass Effect 2 characters so it's just like a little fun option game so hey that's it
6124707	6128649	Well, there's some interesting stuff coming out actually on TV.
6129369	6132231	You may remember Penn & Teller's show Bullshit.
6132371	6132611	Yes.
6132871	6142295	Well, they are taking on JT Voldemort and talking about the evils of video games and violence and all that stuff.
6142556	6149499	If you're interested in watching it, the episode will be available on July 9th is when it's supposed to air.
6149899	6151800	You were talking about one of my favorite shows ever, by the way.
6155404	6156685	XBOX Live Arcade
6175390	6178191	Back in Japan in 1999, and in the U.S.
6178231	6179952	as Fatal Fury, Mark of the Wolves.
6180672	6182793	So, it is the final Fatal Fury title.
6184074	6198261	And last week we had a new Wii game come out, and this is talking about a throwback to the old Laserdisc days, but Digital Leisure has a live-action shooter game you may remember as Mad Dog McCree.
6198281	6199101	Little Bird.
6199581	6214937	They had three games in that series, and all three of those are available for $19.99 in one new pack for the Wii, Mad Dog McCree's Gunslinger Pack, which includes Mad Dog McCree, Mad Dog 2, The Lost Gold, and The Last Bounty Hunter.
6215718	6219142	So, very interesting and old-school crappiness.
6220303	6220403	Um...
6221764	6225726	Another game that's going to be heading its way to the Wii as well.
6226306	6235431	Can I say though, those Matt Dogg McCree games are really trying to bank in on the nostalgia of those laser gun games and how cool they were at the time because it was like OMG video.
6235811	6238312	But by today's standards, please.
6238772	6240373	And they are $20 for all three games.
6240473	6248297	So if you are really willing to buy it, I would suggest waiting for it to really hit the bargain bin.
6248637	6250738	I guess that's a cool value, but still...
6252851	6265442	A new Monkey Ball trademark has been discovered, and I guess based on the title, people are assuming it's going to be using the new... God, it just wouldn't be a week if I didn't have the wrong music kick in at the wrong time, huh?
6267344	6268084	I can't stop it!
6268144	6268565	There we go.
6268725	6269045	Thank you.
6269625	6270426	It's cursed!
6270887	6272268	The song is cursed!
6272648	6273229	Apparently.
6275095	6295380	much like the game Super Monkey Ball which now they've got a new one coming out, Step and Roll which people think, oh Step, the Wii balance board and hey, who doesn't like to whore out the Wii balance board so that game will probably be coming soon from Sega and then that's it
6297264	6300506	I have a few stories I want to cover here real quick in Rapid Fire News as well.
6300946	6303268	We're just going to start off with a story about the iPhone.
6303308	6307671	Commodore 64 apparently has been ported over to the iPhone, which isn't much of a surprise.
6307691	6308892	There's other emulators as well.
6309212	6310153	But here's the thing.
6310953	6318418	Apparently it is Manomio is the folks that put this thing together, a Commodore 64 app on the iPhone.
6318438	6320359	They did this together with a Danish studio.
6321140	6324882	Apparently you can actually run this whole thing on your iPhone.
6324902	6325443	But guess what?
6325603	6326904	Apple has rejected it.
6327924	6328224	What?
6328244	6328345	What?
6346813	6350774	Apparently Space Invaders Extreme is going to be getting some download content.
6351714	6353675	It's Xbox Live Arcade's version, of course.
6353975	6356535	Going to be getting some extra stages and some things.
6357436	6357856	There you go.
6357916	6359796	It's 240 Microsoft points.
6360596	6365158	I guess you get some reimagining of the original Space Invaders and Space Invaders 2.
6365558	6366358	That's a pretty good price.
6366378	6369739	240 points for two games and some download content?
6369799	6370299	Not much at all.
6371465	6374346	I thought Duke Nukem Forever was cancelled, finally.
6396958	6399341	I don't know if we ever get the final word on that or not.
6399361	6405566	I think it's still in limbo because somebody could technically still take the code because wouldn't the publisher now own the code?
6405586	6406467	That's true, that's true.
6406687	6409710	And get somebody else to finish it and call it a done deal?
6410150	6410591	It could happen.
6411432	6411812	It could happen.
6412779	6416400	Alright, we're going to take some time now to bring up your emails.
6416800	6421682	Every week we let you guys send us emails at mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com and we respond to them live on air.
6422082	6423803	In fact, that's what we're going to do right now.
6430505	6431405	DarkSakura, take it away.
6432826	6434366	AlphaKananagram must have been bored.
6434887	6437407	We got an email with the title, You Suck.
6438488	6441429	And then the inside, it says, I love Puyo Puyo Wee.
6443547	6444908	Don't drink and... Is Puyo Puyo on the Wii?
6445669	6445869	No.
6446229	6447110	Wii.
6447530	6449211	When you refer to yourself and other people.
6449772	6450332	I know, I get it.
6450612	6458498	And then, from MisoSky, we have, Hey, I have been noticing that the majority of MMORPGs are either science fiction or medieval fantasy.
6458518	6463382	Do you ever think we will see MMORPGs that are westerns, 1980s, or even modern era?
6463402	6464262	Dude, we have.
6464402	6465063	There was Matrix.
6466004	6468485	Do you think that people are attracted... That's sort of sci-fi.
6468565	6471568	Yeah, that is more sci-fi, but you were in a modern environment.
6472128	6477173	Do you think people are attracted to an MMORPG that has been done countless times before?
6480096	6482798	There actually are pirate-based MMOs.
6483098	6484800	Puzzle Pirates?
6485521	6490525	No, there actually was one that I played a little bit of at PAX last year.
6491767	6494189	Where you could play a pirate and raid for booty.
6496958	6501522	Um, what about, did they mention, like, you know, Star Trek has an MMO coming out?
6501542	6502443	Science Fiction.
6502523	6502943	Or Eve.
6503084	6503904	Oh, it's Science Fiction.
6504785	6506467	Yeah, Science Fiction or Medieval Fantasy.
6506487	6507948	Something else outside the box.
6508128	6508809	Anything Western?
6508829	6514133	Disney has a couple MMOs out there, based on their products, but they're a little...
6515154	6518396	You know Disney stars are genetically engineered in a lab, right?
6518777	6520037	Isn't there a Pirates of the Caribbean?
6520358	6520798	Yeah, there is.
6521138	6524620	But the thing about those games, you can't type text in them.
6525161	6529504	You have predetermined phrases that you can say because obviously they have to keep it family safe.
6529944	6535187	So you don't have mean people in there typing fuck, shit, piss, cock unless that is a preselected phrase.
6535208	6536829	They also have all the adult MMOs.
6537549	6537930	That's true.
6537970	6539411	You can always try to find an adult MMO.
6539451	6540813	Like the Red Light District one?
6541233	6542475	You're going to have to face it.
6542495	6545898	The fantasy and sci-fi ones are by far the most popular, at least right now.
6546439	6546579	Yep.
6547160	6549923	Last one, and it comes from Maren.
6551826	6552466	Okay, ready?
6552706	6553026	It's long.
6553667	6558708	Hey guys, I didn't get to call in, but I wanted to touch on two subjects that were discussed during last week's episode.
6559768	6564450	First, Rob mentioned that some people are complaining about how DJ Hero is just a ripoff of Beatmania 2DX.
6564870	6567711	I believe that Rob protested the idea, saying they're completely different.
6568231	6569851	I'd like to think it's something like this.
6569991	6573632	DJ Hero is to Beatmania 2DX as Guitar Hero is to Guitar Freaks.
6574473	6575273	You could very well...
6577156	6586496	you could very well say that these two games Beatmania and Guitar Freaks are the original music games and that games like DJ and Guitar Hero are knockoffs but I think it's more than that
6587625	6588425	Thank you for watching.
6588466	6589126	See you next time.
6606796	6612280	who play or have played Guitar Freaks but I only have one friend who hasn't played Guitar Hero or Rock Band.
6612660	6618704	Perhaps DJ Hero is similar to Beatmania TDX but it will definitely be something that is more accessible to a Western audience.
6619884	6631712	I for one am happy that DJ Hero is joining the ranks of other music games like Guitar Hero and Rock Band because the success of DJ Hero will only bring us that much closer to having an Americanized keyboard mania game.
6632032	6635655	And I personally will be the first person to stand in line to pre-order Piano Hero Elton John.
6636695	6636955	Yes.
6637136	6637876	Who's surprised?
6638737	6649064	I would say the better comparison I think would be Guitar Freaks and Guitar Hero and then probably Beat Mania and Kraken DJ.
6650384	6658087	because, you know, Kraken DJ, it's kind of a beat-matching game, but it's very different than Beatmania.
6658387	6660748	Well, I have my own thoughts, but let me wait until the email's done.
6661468	6666930	Well, also, I did just get a note in saying that AlphaKananagram says that wasn't him, but an imposter.
6667591	6667951	Whatever.
6668211	6668711	Whatever.
6669851	6670072	Okay.
6673110	6674851	I honestly, I don't really care, I thought it was funny.
6676212	6680735	Finally, I just wanted to touch on the idea of the new PS3 remote.
6681336	6687920	To make a long story short, the idea of the PS3 remote makes me think of the SuperScope 6, pretty nifty idea in theory, complete fail in execution.
6688641	6690362	Take care and have fun gaming, Marin.
6690442	6690702	P.S.
6690722	6693964	DarkSakura, if you come to Las Vegas from July 1st through 7th, I will give you a dollar.
6694285	6694965	Hey, guess what?
6695405	6697407	I'm going to Las Vegas from July 1st through the 7th.
6698925	6699645	You win a dollar.
6699906	6700186	Congrats.
6700206	6701687	How about buy me a soda?
6702547	6704728	You should put that dollar in a slot machine and win a hundred.
6705009	6706309	I don't gamble.
6706369	6707110	I'm going to play bimbo.
6707350	6709651	I agree with some of the email and I disagree with some of it.
6710172	6713573	I agree with the fact that Harmonix has done great things for music games over here.
6713954	6717136	Let's not forget they did create the original Guitar Hero as well as Rock Band.
6717476	6720377	Harmonix rocks.
6720457	6722899	They did what Konami was too pussy to do, basically.
6723519	6726721	For that, they deserve to be commended and get praise lavished upon them.
6726761	6727041	Thank you.
6729522	6732304	From a music game fan like myself, you have to understand.
6732904	6733344	There you go.
6733684	6738246	However, the part I disagree with is the comparison about DJ Hero and the Guitar Freaks, Guitar Hero thing.
6738966	6742228	I get that, and here's the thing.
6742648	6750311	I bet that's the same thing we're going to hear on G4 and for a lot of these networks and stuff, but I don't think it's a real good comparison.
6751031	6757854	I would use the Guitar Hero, Guitar Freaks comparison in trying to describe DDR and In the Groove maybe a little bit.
6758382	6765686	Although, you know, both games were guitars where you held down buttons and strummed the thing in time with it.
6766206	6775991	The thing that's different for me is that that's not really what's happening with DJ Hero is that because you not only have the buttons, but you have the scratching and the crossfader is really big as well.
6776531	6785516	And it's different than it is in 2DX because the whole crossfading leads to a style of gameplay that to me looks more like amplitude in a way.
6786016	6791458	2DX was more where the scratching was just a replacement of another button, basically.
6791698	6792338	Yeah, exactly.
6792758	6802482	And for me, 2DX just feels like it's just DDR but using buttons instead of your feet, which is ironic because Beatmania came before DDR, but that's really what it is.
6802722	6805603	It's another way of reading music, in a way.
6806003	6811305	I think a better comparison would be to say Street Fighter 2 versus Tekken.
6812318	6815881	They're both fighting games, but they're completely different characters.
6816281	6816822	Yeah, exactly.
6817402	6817943	That's what I'm saying.
6818523	6820885	DJ Hero and Beat Me at 2DX, they're both music games.
6820905	6824508	They both involve turntables, but they're really different.
6824648	6826430	They're just like Kraken DJ.
6826630	6830633	When games started coming out and stuff, more fighting games, everyone was like, oh, it's a Street Fighter ripoff.
6831174	6836918	And I think we're going to kind of go through this phase right now with Guitar Hero and these music games because everyone's going to say, oh, it's a ripoff.
6837019	6838520	But really, it's just another music game.
6839482	6846685	But, I mean, we got into it elsewhere on the show, though, as well, is that, you know, now they're charging a premium price for it, and I think that's going to be a little bit damaging.
6847345	6851887	Let's also not forget, though, one thing that is interesting is that DJ Hero is not being made by Harmonix.
6852267	6853268	Something to kind of keep in mind.
6853428	6855549	Harmonix is not making DJ Hero.
6855869	6860211	But that's kind of cool that other developers now, it's not just Harmonix has to make all our music games.
6860331	6864773	But they, yeah, another developer, you know, is the one that did, you know, was...
6865993	6872618	B-Boy, they did that game, which is another sort of music rhythm game with dancing involved and stuff like that.
6872838	6878983	But they kind of have that whole style that they kind of brought with them and stuff and their influences with that.
6879683	6880004	I don't know.
6880024	6880704	I think it looks cool.
6881104	6881885	I'm willing to check it out.
6882305	6890388	I think you might have missed a point, too, is that she wasn't saying that DJ Hero is like 2DX.
6891288	6896590	It pertains to 2DX in the way that Guitar Hero pertained to Guitar Freaks.
6897711	6904793	Not that they're the same type of game, but they're different.
6905594	6909015	It's the Americanized improved version, basically.
6910620	6913822	It's tailored to a different audience and newer.
6914483	6916204	I can see that to a point.
6916664	6921768	It's just so different than it felt when we were talking about Guitar Hero or Guitar Freeze.
6921788	6926992	Because I think when a lot of us looked at Guitar Hero the first time, a lot of us jumped to that whole, oh, it's Guitar Freeze.
6927472	6931655	But now that we're seeing DJ Hero, I don't see 2DX at all.
6932276	6935298	It's just that the basic influence is there.
6937892	6939253	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
6963669	6966530	Showing the Guitar Hero a game like that would be popular in the first place.
6967051	6968531	So, there you go.
6969772	6972693	So, does that do it for the Mailbag?
6973653	6974854	That be it, sir.
6975154	6975314	Arr.
6975614	6975895	All right.
6975935	6980817	If you want to send us more emails, Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com is the place to send your emails.
6981137	6983118	We do have a segment here every week where we read those.
6984038	6986299	Also, we do some interactive stuff through our Twitter.
6986359	6990161	So, if you don't have us added on Twitter yet, you should do that at Twitter.com slash OLR.
6990540	6991480	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7014249	7019974	with Netflix on the Xbox 360 plus Microsoft's own video service.
7021015	7026680	Same thing with the PlayStation Network where you can stream movies as well.
7027260	7040451	Actually, apparently Instat, a marketing analysis group, published a report this week basically examining how this web-to-TV streaming is consumed by people out there.
7041091	7045517	and they found that the majority of it is coming actually from console owners.
7046518	7048200	They said 29% of U.S.
7048260	7054727	console owners between the ages of 25 and 34 currently use their consoles to stream video to their televisions.
7055809	7056710	And yeah, I can see that.
7056770	7060995	I mean, I use it for streaming...
7061966	7065348	Video, and files and stuff like that.
7065368	7069151	Plus, I've also downloaded TV episodes and stuff like that on there.
7069251	7070592	So, it is popular.
7070612	7071413	It's convenient.
7071533	7072353	Here's my question.
7072433	7075055	What's the competition besides game consoles?
7075175	7075776	Apple TV?
7076116	7077137	Are they comparing it to Apple TV?
7077157	7084302	Or are they comparing it to these Netflix boxes that you can buy that are just standalone Netflix devices that I've heard of?
7084642	7093727	Digital media adapters, set-top boxes like Apple TV, Blu-ray players, web-connected HD TVs, and I guess media center PCs.
7095097	7097638	That's odd that they throw Blu-ray players into that.
7097738	7097998	What?
7098598	7100519	I guess web-enabled stuff.
7100539	7104841	Maybe they're talking about how you can get those bonuses on Blu-rays.
7104861	7110022	Oh, yeah, like you can go into the BD Live and get all the user commentary and all that stuff.
7110082	7110743	I can't figure out.
7110963	7113104	That's too complicated for a normal person to use.
7113244	7113664	I'm sorry.
7114004	7117225	But that BD Live stuff with doing all the custom commentary stuff, too complicated.
7117585	7119786	If they want people to actually use that, they need to make it more...
7121386	7121926	Thanks for watching!
7144434	7145554	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7169821	7196330	WALL-E but it's not really a chat room they don't show messages or anything like that because you know somebody would just be on there typing penis penis penis the whole time but what they do they do these weird like polls like a little thing will pop up on the screen like press this button if you saw WALL-E in the theater or press this button if you didn't see it until it came out on blu-ray or whatever and like people vote and it shows you the results these weird little interactive things that I think just need some time to be good
7197430	7197870	It's neat.
7197930	7200012	I kind of looked at it going, that's kind of a neat feature.
7200032	7201673	I wish they could do something more useful with it.
7202513	7204335	Here's what I think would be pretty cool.
7204375	7208397	As you know how with Blu-ray and stuff you can do full Java programming with it.
7209938	7213721	Interactive board games or TV show things like that.
7213761	7217063	Trivia games I think would be pretty cool because you could actually program that stuff in there.
7217944	7224168	And you know how before with a DVD you'd have some sort of crazy menu system and paths and stuff that would go for that.
7224268	7225969	You could actually program a pretty decent game.
7227405	7229687	TigerClaw on chat says, the BD Live stuff is cool.
7229727	7232589	My only gripe is the video extras they offer aren't full screen.
7234531	7237313	I see I've yet to even really figure out how to get the video extras.
7237513	7238034	I don't know what DVD...
7243592	7244253	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7262288	7263029	Thanks for watching!
7278177	7278577	DarkSakura.com
7306398	7316143	and I'm being told the Transformers Blu-ray has new BD Live content featuring footage from the new Transformers movie plus some deleted scenes from the first one that just went released this week.
7316844	7320366	Well that would explain why I don't have it because I don't have the Transformers Blu-ray.
7321326	7322447	I thought about the Transformers Blu-ray.
7322467	7322927	I got it on HD.
7323788	7325368	Ah, there you go.
7325448	7327109	We all got screwed for that so there you go.
7329773	7331454	SSJ100 Matt makes an interesting comment in chat.
7331534	7334495	I'm buying a Blu-ray player for my dad for his birthday this week.
7334855	7336455	I really don't see why he would want any of this.
7336535	7338416	Besides, I don't feel like showing him how to use it.
7339557	7342598	You know, honestly, I have my Blu-ray player on PS3.
7343138	7344678	I don't use any of this extra content.
7344858	7350821	In fact, I could care less about these interactive things where I can go on and chat with the producers and stuff.
7351321	7351641	Who cares?
7351741	7352861	It's a damn DVD.
7352921	7356543	If I want to chat with producers and stuff, I'll go on the internet.
7356583	7357223	It's a Blu-ray.
7358598	7360039	Blu-ray, DVD, or whatever.
7360119	7360700	It doesn't matter.
7360840	7371469	I'm looking for basically the same content that's on a DVD, but maybe in a higher resolution or more content added on there instead of having to have four discs or something like that.
7372930	7374691	Just all on one disc.
7375492	7376032	Would be nice.
7377073	7378554	Back to the original part of the story.
7378915	7380456	The whole Netflix thing.
7382638	7382818	What...
7383939	7387141	What is the central part of this?
7387361	7399350	Are they trying to say that this is just showing that game devices are actually becoming entertainment hubs and all these other types of things that will only do entertainment are being rejected?
7399370	7407175	I think they're surprised that for something that's streaming from the web that the consoles...
7408860	7420586	I guess they're saying basically that video to television streaming is putting pressure on traditional cable providers and will eventually restructure today's video distribution ecosystem.
7421367	7425149	And they're saying that game consoles are at the forefront of this new direction.
7425589	7426710	So basically they're saying...
7428019	7442864	eventually everything is going to go the kind of digital streaming that physical media is going to go away or at least that's what they're claiming and that leading the way of this transition is game consoles hmm
7444482	7445382	That sounds pretty cool.
7445622	7446883	I'm looking at some comments from chat.
7448083	7450444	TigerClaw talks about the particular Blu-ray player he has.
7450864	7454245	I have a Sony BDP-S350 which supports BD Live.
7454265	7457826	The BD Live only works on it as long as you have a USB thumb drive connected on the back.
7458146	7460526	I wonder how many people would even think to do that.
7461607	7464087	There's so many people that just need it to work right out of the box.
7464688	7470709	TheRobD says, I don't know when the last time I listened to a director commentary was, but TigerClaw follows that up with, I love listening to director's commentary.
7471029	7472770	So I guess it really depends on the person.
7473670	7477856	So, kind of interesting.
7477996	7479658	SSJ100Matt closes this thought.
7479758	7481060	It's a gimmick, is what it is.
7482190	7489035	Interesting story on Netflix kind of turned into this whole Blu-ray discussion, but I think that Blu-ray thing is something that will continue to evolve.
7489455	7492298	I think the smart thing that has been built into it is funny.
7492358	7495100	It's something I was critical of Sony on earlier.
7495680	7504967	I was critical on Sony about this, and that is that Sony does not manage to evolve usually, and that's why Microsoft's beating them.
7505487	7505687	But...
7506588	7509650	Now it appears they are evolving in where it comes to Blu-ray.
7509830	7513193	For more updates, that's what it comes down to.
7513813	7517055	Now you can create a new feature and everybody can now have that feature.
7519585	7525067	Alright, well, let's move on to another topic and talk a little bit about something else that's going on on the PlayStation 3 right now.
7525607	7530469	It was a hamster versus human dance-off in PlayStation Home.
7531009	7532190	Yes, you heard me right.
7532410	7537692	This Saturday, this past Saturday, there was a hamsters versus humans dance-off that happened.
7538532	7548576	I just want to point out, it's not April 1st, it is the middle of June, and I don't know what the hell this was for, although apparently...
7549036	7550537	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
7573836	7576418	And some of them look like furries because they're hamsters.
7579141	7584085	I think the most important information that we got out of this is that there's hamster costumes in home.
7584785	7587247	And that's scary now because now there's furries in home.
7587968	7597916	Well, I think my initial reaction when I watched this video and kind of everything that's going on here is, What the fucking fuck is this fucking bullfuck fuck?
7597936	7598376	Woo!
7598880	7599741	I mean, really?
7600201	7601162	What is this?
7601682	7609548	Is this what we imagined PlayStation Home was going to be when they unveiled it at Gamer Developers Conference last year?
7610049	7613351	I mean, is this the innovation that they were looking forward to do in Home?
7613831	7614172	Really?
7614892	7616433	This is just Second Life, okay?
7616453	7618815	This is the kind of crap that happens in Second Life.
7619055	7623319	It's not that I have a problem with the stupidity of the whole thing...
7623999	7627720	But it was on the official Sony PlayStation blog.
7628240	7629820	And I'm just kind of like, really?
7630180	7632601	These are the events I have to look forward to at home?
7633081	7634441	What is the fucking point?
7635381	7637342	Really?
7637462	7644003	Home being used to broadcast the Sony PlayStation conference during E3?
7644423	7646144	That was a great use of home.
7646464	7647324	That was smart.
7647364	7648144	That was cool.
7648604	7650685	And having everybody in that one place, they could view it.
7651065	7652405	Hamsters vs. Humans...
7654068	7658985	and it doesn't look like there was a good turnout for that either I mean it's just like maybe 50 people
7662051	7664092	Well, apparently it was server by server, too.
7664932	7665493	Oh, awesome.
7665513	7666473	You know what, though?
7666793	7668674	You log into home, there's a lot of people using it.
7668794	7670095	I just don't know what they're doing.
7670435	7671635	I have yet to figure that out.
7672015	7674556	Waiting in lines for games?
7674597	7677558	Why do you have to wait in line to play a game?
7677638	7679779	It's a fucking virtual world.
7679879	7682600	You can play the game whenever the hell you want.
7682660	7685141	Why do I have to wait in line to play a virtual game?
7685441	7686462	That's stupid.
7687943	7692884	TigerClaw says home is also being used for Q&As with the directors and stars of big movies.
7693324	7695205	Okay, that's neat, I guess.
7697405	7700166	A little unnecessary, but I guess they do it in Second Life, too.
7701026	7706127	It's something more special than a chat room because you can actually see the director or the special person in front of you.
7706147	7709488	And do the running man as a hamster.
7710768	7713969	Or guinea pig, or whatever the hell.
7714029	7714109	Yeah.
7714129	7716230	SHM100Matt says, why couldn't Jack Trenton talk about this?
7716410	7716750	LOL.
7718155	7720299	Zappy says waiting in lines is very social
7732912	7733753	I don't know.
7733813	7737115	It's hard for me to say because I don't know what types of things people say on home.
7737135	7738575	I don't pay attention to a lot of the dialogue.
7738896	7743318	But I can't imagine people are going to be as cordial online as they are in real life.
7743978	7748080	When you're standing in line at Disneyland, maybe you'll strike up conversation with people around you.
7748161	7748521	Maybe.
7748781	7749101	I don't know.
7749161	7751822	I usually don't because I strike up conversation with the people that are with me.
7752183	7754504	But okay, we are being social because I'm with people.
7755424	7775087	but A, in home you don't really have that everybody goes to home by themselves and B, when people can hide behind their monitors they do stupid shit that they wouldn't do in real life so I don't think people would say hurry the fuck up at Disneyland as much as they would say in Sony Home I don't know I say hurry the fuck up all the time at Disneyland
7776547	7778849	Yeah, but you're not really saying it to a child.
7778869	7779529	Well, maybe you are.
7779589	7779909	I don't know.
7780390	7785173	But yeah, I just... What I wanted to tell some of the parents there is to watch your fucking children, maybe.
7786614	7786934	I don't know.
7786954	7790817	Just when I saw this whole thing, granted, if I don't like it, I just shouldn't play it.
7790857	7792598	But I'm just looking at this going, really?
7793559	7793799	Really?
7793839	7795020	This is what home has become?
7795360	7800304	I can understand if it was some sort of thing that bloggers or whatever decided, hey, let's do this.
7800344	7801024	This is funny.
7801144	7803326	I wouldn't have even reported on it in that case.
7803426	7804987	But it was on the official PlayStation blog.
7806348	7809489	And with a little poster markup and everything.
7810069	7814530	And I don't know if that's kind of like just giving in or conceding to what home has become.
7815091	7821533	But if you want me to have this be, I turn on my PlayStation and the first thing I see is home.
7821853	7825834	And then I walk up to this if I want to launch a game or I have my trophy case and all this stuff.
7826194	7829995	I mean, really, this is not the way to sell it to me that this is ever going to be a reality.
7830015	7834496	You'll be able to launch in the home and view your trophy case coming 2010.
7838835	7840236	It's on the horizon, Rob.
7840256	7844317	You have to understand that the pure use of home, it's coming.
7845497	7846757	It'll be there eventually.
7846837	7851218	Don't worry, we'll have a firm launch date that we won't stick to, but it'll come.
7852278	7852978	I'm so sorry.
7853218	7854939	How could I ever doubt Sony?
7855499	7858260	Especially after the amazing hardware that was the PlayStation 2.
7858500	7858960	How dare I?
7859980	7860940	How dare I be skeptical?
7862980	7864721	All I have to say is bring on the games.
7866822	7870646	Part of me thinks if I'd seen this earlier, I would have actually logged in to check it out.
7870727	7873830	And then once I was there, I would have been like, what the hell am I doing with my life?
7874451	7876954	You know, slash risk, slash risk.
7877635	7878656	But, oh well.
7879116	7880358	They need PvP at home.
7881934	7884135	or just maybe a game somewhere in there.
7884175	7884575	I don't know.
7885095	7885696	PvP.
7885736	7886936	PvP would be better.
7887696	7892178	It would be cool if I could actually walk up to somebody and it was very easy to start a game.
7892498	7892939	But I don't know.
7892999	7897040	At the same time, maybe finding my friends list in a home would be a place to start.
7897680	7902242	Maybe a section of home that only my friends list can access or friends of friends can access.
7902682	7903323	I would love that.
7903523	7908505	A section where I only see friends and friends of friends and then can start up really easy, quick games with them.
7909181	7909521	DarkSakura.com
7929929	7932470	Well, as a matter of fact, I do.
7933070	7936271	And this is actually something that I think is really, really cool.
7937391	7952394	Namco Museum Essentials is coming to PlayStation Home in July, which looks like we'll be getting Pac-Man, Galaga, Dig Dug, Dragon Spirit, Xevious, and a 1080p quote re-envisioned Xevious Resurrection, which is pretty cool.
7952735	7955615	So you get your trophies, leaderboards, blah, blah, blah.
7955675	7958676	But it's more Namco, and that's always happy.
7959758	7961879	But the important thing to note about this is it's in home.
7962220	7962940	Yeah, it's in home.
7963200	7964241	That's strange.
7965202	7966342	So am I going to have to buy this?
7966743	7970465	Is home going to be the only place I can play this Xevious re-imaging?
7970845	7972186	I doubt it for very long.
7972306	7976609	So you buy the game and then you have to wait in line to play your own game that you just bought?
7976629	7979050	Surely it can't be like that.
7979070	7980551	Maybe it goes in your own house.
7981552	7982373	That would make sense.
7982853	7984814	If you buy this game and it goes in the house you own.
7985555	7986615	Can other friends play it?
7986855	7987816	Or is it going to be sorry?
7987836	7989257	You can invite friends in your home, can't you?
7989693	7989973	Yeah.
7990774	7993856	But it's just so... Honestly, I have to be honest.
7994056	7995958	I don't really know how to do that.
7996158	7999000	One thing Sony could do is make this whole thing easier.
8000541	8001041	You know what I mean?
8001742	8001942	Yeah.
8002202	8002943	Like, okay.
8003843	8004444	Facebook.
8004884	8005464	Bejeweled.
8006105	8008186	Tons of people play Bejeweled on Facebook, right?
8008206	8010748	I don't know about your friends list, but on my friends list, tons of people play.
8011489	8012389	You know why they all play?
8012850	8014031	Because when one person plays...
8015111	8016011	And they get a good score.
8016291	8018792	They click a button and it publishes to their profile.
8019192	8019973	I'm playing this game.
8020033	8021513	Come play with me by clicking here.
8022413	8023314	That's how easy it is.
8025334	8029876	If they want home to be like this central place that everybody... It needs to be that easy.
8030956	8034558	And I'm sure I have listeners that are like, Rob, all you have to do is open up the menu and da-da-da-da-da.
8034598	8035218	I'm like, no, no, no.
8035418	8036338	You're not hearing what I'm saying.
8036998	8039479	It needs to be easier than that.
8041180	8041720	If you want...
8043272	8044312	Thank you for watching.
8044332	8044973	See you next time.
8065023	8075777	I don't know though, as far as the Namco thing goes, I guess that's pretty cool, but I guess this could be the start of where we really start to see now maybe the full intention of home?
8076338	8077139	If you want to call it that?
8077339	8077659	I don't know.
8079221	8080563	To cash in on stuff?
8081024	8081785	Sounds good to me.
8083359	8085300	I don't know, I think this would be kind of cool.
8113237	8114598	I really wanna play it, actually.
8114618	8117440	I really, really wanna play it, because I love Xevious.
8136989	8140572	Actdeft in our chatroom points out Yaris was free too, and we all know how that turned out.
8141913	8142814	So, there you go.
8145156	8146817	Marin in chat makes a very good point.
8146937	8148839	Home in real life is where you're lazy.
8149339	8151741	Home for PlayStation 3 should be lazy-friendly too.
8152302	8153222	Exactly my point.
8154383	8158006	And RPGKing7 says it has to be stupid-friendly.
8158166	8158487	It does.
8159167	8159507	It does.
8159528	8160068	It does.
8161649	8166952	If we want our parents and some of our friends who aren't as into gaming, you all know this.
8167712	8172836	You all have a friend who thinks video games are kind of fun, but doesn't really play an awful lot of them.
8173336	8178139	But they might own a next-gen system that they play Madden or a role-playing game on once in a while.
8178159	8178659	You know what?
8179019	8180500	They wouldn't know how to use a lot of this stuff.
8180600	8182681	They need to take, I think, examples.
8183382	8188545	What they need to do is kind of learn from MMOs and what people do in their downtime in MMOs.
8189065	8196112	I think home should add fishing because there's plenty of fishing going on in Final Fantasy XI and you know what?
8196172	8198534	That's something you can do by yourself and just kick back.
8198735	8202178	Actually, what about something like item synthesis or professions?
8202959	8205901	I know it sounds stupid but imagine if you could make your own shirts.
8206582	8207782	and things within reason.
8207802	8215485	Like I'm not saying put your own designs on it because everybody will walk around with a shirt saying fuck or topless mods that just pictures of boobs and things like that.
8216085	8225949	But I'm saying like, you know, people could collect items in home and then build stuff and then maybe even like sell them for fake money.
8226029	8226369	I don't know.
8227089	8229790	But then I'm turning home into an MMO and I guess that's not his intention.
8230291	8231331	But all right.
8232168	8233629	Let's move on to another topic.
8233809	8236590	And we're going to get into some Listless for tonight.
8237111	8240552	And I'm excited because we haven't done Listless in a long time here on the show.
8240933	8242633	And I need to find the music, though.
8243434	8243894	Shame on me.
8243934	8245275	I didn't have the music queued up already.
8245295	8247356	But we have music that goes with Listless.
8248116	8249877	And it's a remake of a familiar tune.
8251438	8251918	Ah, there we go.
8251938	8252999	The theme music for Listless.
8255282	8263926	All right, the way this works, folks, if you've never heard this segment before on Orange Lounge Radio, we've been doing it ever since the very beginning because this is a segment I used to do on my college radio show.
8264046	8265967	So it gives you an idea like how old this is.
8266347	8267247	All right, so here it is.
8267267	8272390	We're going to take a topic and then we are each here in studio going to give our top four for that topic.
8272930	8275031	Yes, we've changed things up a little bit since last time we've done this.
8275491	8277252	We're all going to give our top four for the topic.
8277732	8297749	and then we will have made a list of 12 between the list of 4 that both DarkSakura, Loki and myself make then we will each go around and take one item off of the list leaving us with a list of 9 then you guys in chat will vote on the 9, your favorite and you give us your number 1 and number 2 votes and then we should have a definitive list
8298680	8299401	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
8324065	8335545	And Reggie Fils-Aimé asked, Well, in the same vein of Team Ninja working with Nintendo to reimagine Metroid, what development group would your readers love to see partner and collaborate with Nintendo and on what franchise?
8338166	8339526	So, you know, let's face it.
8339586	8344428	Metroid Other M was probably the big, big announcement out of Nintendo for us hardcore gamers.
8344788	8347148	OMG Team Ninja working with Nintendo.
8347188	8347868	Who would have thought?
8348749	8354430	So, what do you think could be the next OMG developer working with a Nintendo franchise?
8356090	8357911	That's what we're here to put the list together tonight.
8357951	8359551	So let's start putting that list together.
8359991	8361732	Loki, why don't you start us off this week?
8361792	8364012	Give us your number four answer.
8364512	8365973	Ah, number four answer.
8366113	8366733	Let me see.
8368943	8371544	This is kind of a joke answer, so we're going to go with that.
8372244	8375665	Akira Yamaoka and Luigi's Mansion.
8377245	8378325	Akira Yamaoka.
8378885	8381186	So Team Silent or just Akira Yamaoka?
8381226	8381826	Team Silent.
8381866	8384427	Okay, Team Silent is going to remake Luigi's Mansion.
8384447	8385107	That's pretty awesome.
8385287	8385927	How would that work?
8386547	8390868	It would be extremely intense, but with Luigi.
8393169	8394729	Would Pyramid Head make an appearance in it?
8394749	8396870	Less whimsical, more scary, I guess.
8399028	8399748	Alright, fair enough.
8400768	8405510	Let's see, my answer would be my number four answer tonight.
8405950	8408811	Blizzard, the folks behind World of Warcraft, right?
8408871	8411891	Blizzard would make an Animal Crossing game.
8413112	8415853	So now Animal Crossing really would be an MMO.
8416253	8418713	So Blizzard makes an Animal Crossing game.
8421674	8424595	Alright, so DarkSakura, what is your number four pick and why?
8424977	8426678	God, mine's actually kind of related to that.
8426718	8428600	The Sims team doing a new Animal Crossing.
8430802	8435525	And actually, you know, make it interesting.
8435686	8435966	Nice.
8436046	8439269	We both had Animal Crossing answers back to back.
8440270	8442432	Suda51 or Grasshopper Manufacturer and Wario Land
8469907	8480570	And, you know, Suda51 is the, you know, the mind behind Killer7 and No More Heroes and just, like, the insane, crazy shit that's in those games.
8481150	8489473	Put that in Wario Land, because, you know, WarioWare and stuff's really crazy, so it'd just be batshit crazy, just the platformer.
8490333	8491413	That is insane.
8493714	8495274	That is just pure insanity.
8495954	8496675	Alright, fair enough.
8497235	8497335	Um...
8498672	8499733	DarkSakura, you're number three.
8525672	8530784	My number three is the Outrun team doing the next Cruisin'.
8532227	8533310	And making that a good game.
8534936	8537016	I haven't thought of Cruisin' for a very long time.
8537036	8538577	I thought Cruisin' was Midway.
8539857	8540657	Is it?
8541037	8545658	But didn't they, no, that was with Nintendo and Rare.
8546098	8548738	Yeah, I think there was something, yeah, Rare had something to do with it too.
8548799	8549139	Whatever.
8549539	8550239	So fair enough.
8550479	8551299	You know what, we'll let it slide.
8551319	8551839	It doesn't even matter.
8552119	8554660	So Outrun Team makes Cruisin' and brings that series back.
8554720	8557700	It certainly has memories on Nintendo 64 and all that.
8557760	8558720	So there you go.
8560641	8561061	Let's see.
8562241	8562541	Loki.
8563652	8564733	We're halfway through.
8564773	8565273	What would you say?
8566795	8569517	Let's see if I should start doing some of my serious ones here.
8573820	8575482	The chat room is clarifying, by the way.
8575522	8578624	It was Midway made it, but for Nintendo.
8578944	8582207	So it was really a Nintendo franchise that Midway made.
8582227	8585910	Looks like... I hope I don't mispronounce this.
8586571	8589353	Kaita Takahashi and Yoshi's Island.
8591881	8593782	That would be hilarious.
8594363	8598005	And Kaito Takahashi, the creator of Katamari Damacy.
8601007	8601887	And Yoshi's Island.
8601927	8603128	What would this game be like?
8603388	8604529	Touch Fuzzy, Get Dizzy?
8605149	8607651	Yes, the entire game would be Touch Fuzzy, Get Dizzy.
8608011	8608451	Nice.
8610032	8611513	Alright, let's see.
8611633	8613815	Then we're going to get into my number two answer.
8615455	8619156	Q Entertainment, because I'll buy practically anything Q Entertainment does.
8619677	8632182	Remaking, and I'm kind of stretching it a little bit, kind of like the Cruisin' Answer, but Nintendo does have the rights here to Tetris on their own, and Nintendo obviously put out a lot of the big versions of Tetris.
8632582	8638084	I think Q Entertainment should just give us a new Tetris, infused with all the music and lights and hypnotic stuff.
8638104	8639124	So that's what I want.
8645649	8646710	Sorry for the silence.
8646730	8648630	I'm actually typing out a list here as we go.
8648690	8649271	So, all right.
8649551	8652292	DarkSakura, your number two answer, please.
8652512	8654633	The Silent Hill team doing Luigi's Mansion.
8655874	8656574	I thought you did that.
8656794	8657375	Oh, my gosh.
8657435	8659055	You guys both had the same one?
8659095	8659576	Oh, I didn't.
8659676	8661116	I thought you were talking about a different game.
8661236	8661556	Oh, shit.
8661817	8662337	Oh, how funny.
8662517	8663057	That's all right.
8663297	8664358	No, no, no, no.
8664458	8665939	I'll pick something different.
8666599	8669480	The Silent Hill.
8669760	8670501	No, shoot.
8670541	8672522	I can do another one if she wants to take mine.
8672542	8672962	I don't care.
8673803	8675884	No, because I completely missed it.
8677224	8682925	Okay, how about the... There's lots of good ideas in chat.
8684066	8686766	Yeah, but I don't listen to them.
8687046	8693788	Actually, okay, how about Square doing the next Zelda game?
8697972	8698672	Alright, fair enough.
8698712	8705234	Zelda's a beloved franchise, but maybe it's time to turn it over and let some other people who are more experienced at it have a crack at it.
8705254	8705874	Alright, there you go.
8705914	8707034	Square makes a Zelda game.
8707494	8723658	Alright, so so far we have Team Silent makes Luigi's Mansion, Blizzard makes Animal Crossing, Sims Team makes Animal Crossing, Suda51 makes Wario Land, Capcom makes Kid Icarus, Outrun Team makes Cruisin', Keita Takahashi makes Yoshi's Island, Q Entertainment makes Tetris, Square makes a Zelda game.
8724138	8725639	Let's get into the number one answers.
8726139	8727519	Loki, your number one answer, please.
8727659	8739154	I'm sorry Rob, this is probably going to take years but Criterion Games does the next F-Zero because Burnout is fucking awesome and it just lends itself perfectly to F-Zero
8740816	8760297	well you read my mind but Criterion Games was not who I actually thought of to take over the F-Zero franchise my number one answer is Sega, Namco, and Nintendo all team up again and finally bring us a fucking sequel to F-Zero GX and yes I phrased it just like that so Sega and Namco once again make F-Zero GX
8767196	8769958	That's two F-Zero GXs as number one answer so far.
8770018	8771839	Let's see if... I'm sorry, just F-Zero.
8771859	8773020	I guess the GX wouldn't really be there.
8773581	8776162	Let's see if DarkSakura has the same answer or something new.
8776523	8777003	Something new.
8777664	8779044	Treasure doing a new Kid Icarus.
8780846	8783047	Could you imagine how hard that shit would be?
8786510	8787631	That could be very interesting.
8789272	8790453	Some runner-ups I had.
8791433	8793534	Arc System Works and Smash Bros.
8794535	8797556	Arc System Works, of course, the Guilty Gear franchise.
8798197	8801058	Oh god, that would be crazy.
8801078	8801839	2D Smash Bros.
8801859	8802659	game would be kind of cool.
8803960	8805401	Bethesda and Zelda.
8810223	8811664	Another one that just popped into my head.
8812184	8815206	Kojima Productions and Battalion Wars.
8817114	8817834	Nice.
8817914	8818695	No Earthbound.
8818755	8823596	I was almost going to say that Square should do the Earthbound game, but I don't know.
8823676	8828878	Earthbound's very American, even though, yes, I realize.
8831059	8832540	Square's very Japanese-centric.
8832560	8834120	I just don't think it would meld well.
8834140	8837321	I was trying to think of the perfect developer for that, but I couldn't.
8838682	8839122	So there you go.
8839847	8841268	Alright, well guess what guys?
8841428	8842328	Here it is, the list.
8842388	8843689	Now we gotta go around and eliminate.
8843709	8844529	This is gonna be hard.
8844929	8846170	Alright, so here it is so far.
8846290	8848471	Team Silent makes Luigi's Mansion.
8848971	8851252	Blizzard makes a new Animal Crossing game.
8852132	8854853	The Sims team makes a new Animal Crossing game.
8855213	8856914	Suda51 makes Wario Land.
8857014	8858215	Capcom makes Kid Icarus.
8858675	8859975	Outrun team makes Cruisin'.
8860275	8861976	Keita Takahashi makes Yoshi's Island.
8862316	8863577	Q Entertainment makes Tetris.
8863917	8865037	Square makes a Zelda game.
8865097	8866638	Criterion Games makes F-Zero.
8866998	8868739	Sega and Namco once again make F-Zero.
8869079	8870320	and Treasure makes Kid Icarus.
8870780	8872621	Loki, which one of these is not worthy of the list?
8873001	8874262	Outrun Team makes Cruisin'.
8875703	8875883	Aww.
8876844	8877324	Boo-hiss.
8877544	8880225	I'm sorry, the last few Cruisin' games have really sucked.
8880906	8882207	But this would breathe new life.
8882547	8884148	I don't know about that.
8884908	8885208	Alright.
8888110	8890832	I am going to take out Suda51 makes Wario Land.
8891192	8891872	Too crazy.
8891972	8893413	It's just too weird.
8893433	8894674	I don't get it.
8896141	8898542	DarkSakura, which one of these is not worthy of the list?
8899542	8901302	Blizzard doing Animal Crossing.
8901822	8904003	You just want yours to be the only Animal Crossing.
8904063	8905183	No, honestly.
8906584	8907244	All right, fair enough.
8907504	8908364	All right, so there you go.
8908624	8912725	Three have been eliminated from the list, leaving us with a list of nine that the chat will now vote on.
8912785	8913325	Here it is.
8913785	8915686	We'll get to the answers a little later in the show.
8915706	8923528	Remember, you need to be in our chat, chat.orangeloungeradio.com, and you can place a private message to Rob Roberts in chat right now.
8924028	8926871	with your number one and number two answers.
8927331	8928132	So, here we go.
8928833	8946329	Team Silent makes Luigi's Mansion, The Sims Team makes a new Animal Crossing game, Capcom makes Kid Icarus, Keita Takahashi makes Yoshi's Island, Q Entertainment makes Tetris, Square makes a Zelda game, Criterion Games makes F-Zero, Sega and Namco once again make F-Zero, or Treasure makes Kid Icarus.
8946489	8946810	So we have...
8947410	8964675	2 F0s and 2 Kid Icarus is on there so we'll see how that plays out if they split the votes or what so remember you can place a vote now to Rob Roberts in the chat room with a private message and indicate your number 1 and your number 2 or it will be assumed that your first answer is your number 1 pick while we tally that up
8965947	8967547	We're going to get into another segment here.
8968068	8976670	We like to call the FUs of the week, but in order for our angst to build, we have to have a story that makes it worthy of us building the angst.
8977750	8980571	And I also have to cue the music, which I was completely unprepared for tonight.
8981151	8984512	I'm not used to this new format yet where everything's in a different order in the show.
8985572	8985872	Anyhow...
8987540	8990022	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
9014162	9021245	Nor could you redeem codes, including your pre-order codes for the Xbox 360 version of Ghostbusters.
9021605	9023686	So the PlayStation 3 users got to jump on that.
9023726	9031470	And look, all I'm going to say is if you're going to take your system down for 24 hours, it should be working by the time you bring it back up.
9031550	9032750	Or don't bring it back up.
9033391	9034891	So stories like this make us angry.
9034971	9038273	So yeah, we're going to bring on the FUs of the week.
9054585	9063029	My FU of the week goes towards sleeping for 12-13 hours because I lost most of my day.
9066711	9077436	My FU goes to Xbox Live Marketplace because Angry Barry is still broken and I still am out 400 Microsoft points and nobody seems to be fixing anything.
9077557	9080218	Very convenient, Microsoft, now that you have my money.
9084735	9090864	Um, my FU of the week goes to the fact that I just told people to vote for the wrong thing.
9090925	9091485	Sorry, guys.
9091546	9093108	Yes, in chat, it's Rob Roberts, not Sky.
9093128	9094610	Look, three people fixed it all in a row.
9094931	9096233	I'm broken and I don't know what it is.
9096934	9097034	Um...
9098314	9101236	I guess I'm going to say F you to the swine flu for reals.
9101816	9112083	I know there's been a lot of jokes and ha-has made about it, but I actually have a friend suffering from swine flu right now who's in the hospital in ICU and is really not in good shape right now.
9112203	9117127	And a lot of us are actually kind of scared because she had to get put on dialysis this morning.
9117147	9119688	That's how bad it's gotten because her kidneys are failing from all the meds.
9120229	9123831	So yeah, she contracted swine flu.
9124071	9128114	I don't know where it came from, but Beth, I am thinking of you and I really want you to get better soon.
9128505	9128776	and more.
9129102	9134426	So, let's go ahead and move on to some more gaming news.
9134706	9134966	Yes.
9135286	9137908	While I tally the votes, my God, there's tons of people voting tonight.
9138789	9146774	Well, of course, you would think with the Apple iPhone and the iPod Touch, you know, it's a bit limited in what you can do with games on there.
9147234	9157821	So, of course, and this is actually being listed as one of the features with the iPhone 3.0 firmware, is that third-party accessories are going to now,
9159482	9186097	and this is actually coming from the official iPod Touch software update page and so people are thinking oh goody we're going to get controller add-ons and so that might be actually what's going to happen because with gaming being so popular nowadays and really those touch screen controls suck I mean look at Mega Man 2 they need a new alternative so it might actually be an add-on
9187970	9188430	So what do you think?
9188450	9189130	Is that a good idea?
9189170	9191231	Would you actually play with something like this?
9191291	9200655	Sorry, I'm like tallying cage match votes right now, so it's hard for me to totally pay attention, but... It really, I think, would depend on how well executed it is, honestly.
9201715	9204816	They'd really have to do something impressive.
9206697	9207037	I don't know.
9207237	9208458	I mean, I think it's kind of...
9209768	9210749	I guess it's okay.
9210909	9219597	I mean, a lot of people are kind of bitchy about, you know, oh, I don't want to, you know, have some stupid peripheral hanging off of my, you know, iPod to play a game.
9219717	9223520	But, you know, I guess you don't necessarily need to buy it.
9223920	9227483	And some people are saying, hey, now they can do Guitar Hero on iPhone.
9228864	9229445	I hope not.
9230005	9230826	That would be scary.
9232027	9234129	But, I don't know.
9236209	9242451	Well, I mean, the iPhone kind of needs something like that if it's really going to be like the next wave in gaming or whatever.
9242611	9246132	You know, I don't know how seriously Apple's taking gaming right now.
9246952	9253795	Because I've heard about this whole like premium games for the iPhone thing, which I think is silly.
9254215	9257276	The games that are on there right now, I don't see them getting much better than that.
9257556	9259416	Why should I pay four times as much?
9259736	9262717	Especially when there's a lot of great indie games that are 99 cents or free.
9263097	9263618	You know what I mean?
9263878	9264598	Yeah, definitely.
9264618	9264698	So.
9266704	9267024	I don't know.
9271307	9274230	Okay, I'm trying to see if there's anything going on in chat right now.
9274270	9280074	They're still talking about the list list tonight a little bit, which I'm still trying to tally up.
9280975	9285198	The Rob D in chat, though, says, isn't the point of the iPhone 3GS to be better for gaming?
9286279	9287359	I don't think not necessarily just gaming.
9287379	9289561	How about to be a more efficient multimedia machine?
9290001	9290602	That's what I think.
9291852	9292092	DarkSakura,
9304085	9308686	Alright, well, I believe that brings us to the end of our topics tonight.
9308726	9315548	So we're going to go ahead and open up the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
9315568	9322471	If you want to give us a call, if you have any type of topic you want to bring up that we missed tonight, 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
9323131	9327132	Meanwhile, do we have any last minute stories or missed rapid fires that we want to talk about?
9328250	9330053	Yeah, sure, I've got some stuff I can talk about.
9330473	9345290	Apparently, there's a rumor that Michael Jackson is involved with the new video game, and no word on exactly what that is yet, but apparently, there's something that he's working on right now.
9345991	9346472	No, um...
9347851	9348972	I don't know.
9348992	9353559	This is coming out of... It's actually a foreign article.
9354740	9360488	9lives.be is the website that has the information on it.
9361910	9364714	It's kind of hard to determine what exactly they're talking about.
9365302	9367303	I have gone through an official Xbox rite of passage How so?
9394574	9395314	Red Ring of Death
9419363	9419923	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
9437602	9438322	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
9454431	9454971	DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com
9480416	9482658	Yeah, and you've had your Xbox for the past year.
9483118	9488362	So, you know, that's the price you pay for having something early, I suppose.
9489182	9496987	Yeah, and what was funny was that when I went to fire it up, it didn't even have the new Xbox experience so I had to download everything first.
9497548	9498028	Oh, really?
9498088	9499069	That is kind of interesting.
9500380	9502925	I still have one of the older consoles or something.
9503365	9506911	Perhaps, but I don't think they're going to give you the top-of-the-line ones as a replacement.
9507212	9508414	That's probably the hidden text.
9509395	9512901	Well, I could have asked for a different box if I wanted to, but...
9516041	9516882	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
9536036	9537537	Oh, because you get to keep your drive.
9537557	9537637	Okay.
9563796	9570280	Yeah, it seems that with Best Buy, you bring it in, you hold onto the hard drive, and they just give you a brand new console.
9570920	9572581	I guess, but that's the same thing they do with Microsoft, too.
9572621	9573801	I never sent my hard drive back.
9573841	9576643	I think it's something to do about the actual serial on the Xbox 360.
9576903	9577183	I don't know.
9577443	9580585	I haven't played either of those games in a long time, either, so they might have changed something.
9580685	9585067	Because, you know, now there's Geometry Wars 2, and I couldn't tell you the last time I signed on to Xbox Live and played Joust.
9585367	9586088	But I should do that.
9586128	9586908	Joust is awesome.
9588169	9588289	So...
9589013	9596519	I should think about that, but most of the time I'm just streaming videos and stuff off my 360 from my computer because I don't like sitting here in front of the 19-inch.
9596599	9599301	I'd rather watch it in glorious 32-inch.
9600021	9600742	Amen to that.
9601542	9602423	Size does matter.
9603864	9604665	That's what she said.
9604905	9607147	Alright, Ranma, anything else before we let you go tonight?
9608308	9608788	That's it.
9609332	9610713	Alright, you take care buddy, have a good one.
9611353	9612013	Later.
9612033	9615115	877-GAME-OLR, Orange Lounge Radio on Skype.
9615435	9618137	Listless results coming right up, but a few more last minute stories.
9618357	9618897	Do we have any more?
9620138	9630023	Yeah, actually that one thing I was talking about, the Michael Jackson game, he's supposed to be starring in his own game, so no word on exactly what that is, but it's a game that he's actually going to be the lead in.
9630923	9634365	Quick question, chat, anyone interested in a Michael Jackson game?
9634525	9635005	Would you buy it?
9636006	9636846	If Sega did it.
9637326	9638227	Let's say it's a music game.
9639807	9640669	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
9640689	9641010	Who's this?
9641772	9642474	Pleasure, I'm Zaku.
9642694	9644739	Hey, Zaku, what's on your mind?
9644819	9648729	Nothing much, just spending a rainy weekend here in New York City.
9649634	9650635	If it's Moonwalker 2, yes.
9671547	9673509	Boone Walker 2, Michael Jackson Boone Walker 2?
9673549	9674810	Yes, Michael Jackson's Boone Walker 2.
9674850	9682679	You might not have heard it because you were calling in, but I asked the chatters, if Michael Jackson is really making a video game and starring in it, would you buy it?
9682979	9689406	Will that involve, like, you know, Jesus Juice and other sexual accusations?
9689446	9690527	Let's not go there.
9690627	9693110	Zakud, what did you want to call in about tonight?
9693775	9698342	Alright, basically I just wanted to bring up a little gem that I managed to find this weekend.
9698382	9702929	Apparently, I don't know if you heard, but this probably made Kotaku earlier today, but
9704672	9709053	Apparently, these developers were making an iPhone Commodore 64 application.
9709474	9714415	We did touch on it during Rapid Fire News and it got shut down, which stinks, doesn't it?
9714955	9716496	What do you think about it getting shut down?
9717236	9720657	Well, I guess on one hand it's Apple's walled garden.
9720857	9725418	You see that they pretty much control what apps make it onto their store.
9726258	9728659	And I guess they ran afoul with the fact that
9729099	9729619	And I can see that.
9729639	9729759	Bigo.
9742093	9749556	You could pretty much run any other app, any other music synthesizer, for example.
9749916	9750256	Bingo.
9751017	9751577	It's too much.
9751657	9752757	It leaves it too vulnerable.
9753458	9757239	I kind of actually understand where Apple's coming from for the model they're trying to build.
9757379	9765702	I guess Sega basically dodged it by creating a standalone emulator hard-coded for Sonic and Golden Axe.
9765742	9769144	So there's no way you would have been able to run an arbitrary code.
9769984	9782794	So I guess if those C64 guys want to make their apps on the App Store, they just got to make drastic changes to the point where they have to bundle the games that they license them from.
9782954	9786637	So it's going to be one app for The Last Ninja, one app for...
9792902	9794204	or something like that.
9794724	9796687	Or you could sell the other games as DLC.
9796967	9799129	But then, you know where it's not going to work?
9799810	9802653	Now you have to get all the original publishers involved.
9803074	9803594	You know what I mean?
9804355	9807319	As opposed to being able to run all your old code
9807699	9813361	I bet I could find my old Commodore 64 floppies and the mass amounts of games I had.
9813681	9815881	I would love to have a night.
9816081	9819502	We seriously need to plan the time we are going to freaking do this.
9819862	9825664	Just do some seriously hardcore old fucking school gaming on big televisions.
9826064	9827686	well, we've got the vault
9841434	9846899	and just like really old school consoles right there in one particular room out of six game rooms that weekend.
9847180	9851344	I really want to figure out, maybe we could do this at a con or something, tag on to some con.
9851684	9855468	I want to broadcast it and I want to marathon obscure classic games.
9855488	9857970	I don't want to do like Mario Brothers and all that.
9857990	9864617	It's some type of charity thing, but it's all obscure shit, like stuff that you may not have played before, like Impossible Mission or other Congress 64 games.
9864637	9865718	What about that Penn & Teller game?
9866599	9869363	That Penn & Teller game we just drive on a bus for hours.
9869503	9870865	Yeah, but let's face it.
9871445	9873068	The joke is that the game is stupid.
9873809	9875952	I don't want to do something like that.
9876492	9882701	Seriously, go through our own Classic Game of the Week archive and pick like 10 of those obscure games and play those.
9883062	9883242	You know?
9884042	9888345	I mean, I had my share of obscure games and I had my NES, so I pretty much have a good pig.
9888825	9890546	Ziba says, at PAX, please.
9891046	9896649	You know, dude, if we could get a room at PAX somehow like that, I would love that, except we're probably not big enough.
9896689	9898210	But I never thought about it either.
9898330	9904554	You have to start with the smaller, you have to start with the con, at the con level, since that's pretty much your domain at the moment.
9904854	9907616	PAX is kind of like major, it's like a major indie thing.
9908116	9910097	It's kind of like the E3 of indie games.
9911477	9914818	I agree we need to piggyback on a con somewhere.
9914878	9916658	Maybe I need to talk to the SakAnime people.
9916718	9917078	We'll see.
9917138	9918299	We need to do a lock-in.
9919999	9922760	We need to rent the Masonic Lodge for a weekend and do a lock-in.
9922780	9923340	That would be cool.
9923600	9926021	All right, Zaku, we're going to let you go so we can get some more calls.
9926121	9926501	But thank you.
9926521	9927221	You have a good one, buddy.
9927984	9929125	Yeah, have a good weekend, man.
9944693	9946074	Mega Man ZX and the EXE Universe
9968110	9972592	And then finally, there's a new record being broken.
9972752	9979334	The Frogger score held by fictional character George Costanda is going to be challenged, I guess, this weekend.
9980535	9980855	Interesting.
9980995	9981495	We got a call.
9981895	9982736	You're on Orange Launch Radio.
9982756	9983116	Who's this?
9984036	9985177	This is RPGKing7.
9985497	9986937	RPGKing7.
9987217	9988898	Are you truly the king of RPGs?
9989958	9991319	I like to think I'm the seventh in line.
9991339	9992179	There are guys above me.
9992579	9994860	Have you played this Final Fantasy IV after years?
9994940	9996361	That's what I'm all the rage about right now.
9997040	9997820	No, not yet.
9998561	10000882	I don't have a Wii, so... Oh my gosh.
10001302	10002843	You've got to figure out a way to play it, though.
10004064	10005725	My parents have a Wii, so I'll probably get it.
10005965	10007005	There you go.
10007025	10014969	I know you probably called in to talk about something else, but I've got to ask you a question, because I want to talk about After Years with somebody, and you're the best thing I've got, because you're at least RPG King.
10015670	10018972	Did you hear the story about the whole Chrono Trigger fan project getting shut down?
10020052	10021073	Oh my god, you're reading my mind.
10021113	10022653	That's exactly what I wanted to bring up.
10022854	10025295	Ah, okay, then you say your thing, and then I'll say mine.
10026189	10033734	Well, I was wondering, you know, why isn't the, I was going to mention it and bring it up, that they were like practically complete, and then Square shut them down.
10034014	10043480	I'm wondering, what do you guys think Square is being so anal about it, whereas there's like a million Mario and other fan projects, and the other publishers haven't said boo.
10044158	10045159	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
10063038	10063859	Yeah, like, even that...
10090723	10097005	Sorry, I just want to jump into that other project that was a few years ago, where they built up a 3D version of it from the ground up.
10098105	10099765	And Square cut them off pretty early.
10100205	10101266	That wasn't that long ago.
10101306	10102166	I remember that, though.
10103146	10110708	Again, I think protecting their rights, because Square's been doing all these remakes on the DS that are in 3D, so maybe they want to do something like that.
10110808	10111228	I don't know.
10112248	10113329	But, yeah.
10114569	10114689	Um...
10116467	10122169	I think they're doing it because they don't want to shut the door on the possibility to do that stuff later on.
10122950	10134875	Yeah, because I remember years and years ago they copyrighted the name Chrono Break and people were thinking, oh man, they're going to do a new Chrono Trigger, they're going to do a new Chrono Trigger, but they haven't done anything.
10137831	10138212	I don't know.
10138592	10142056	Maybe it's going to be the ace in the hole or whatever, but I know the fans are getting restless.
10142176	10148242	Why are they continuing to shut down all these projects if they're not going to do anything with the Chrono Trigger franchise?
10148362	10148683	I don't know.
10149644	10150264	Look at Nintendo.
10150284	10158173	They had the whole fan project that did Mother 3 and it looks like we're never ever going to get that.
10159278	10160118	I know, it's sad.
10160559	10161219	It's very sad.
10161359	10165620	And I wish we would, because EarthBound's a fun series, and they could put it on WiiWare like that.
10165680	10168781	It would be so easy, but for whatever reason, they just don't want to do it.
10168821	10170562	Sorry, I didn't mean to cut you off.
10170622	10172083	No, it's okay.
10172163	10180486	I was saying that the whole DSiWare, and one of the speculations I remember hearing was that they'll put the old Game Boy and Game Boy Advance games on there.
10180666	10182186	They put EarthBound 3 on there.
10182226	10184507	They'll get a huge number of people buying that up.
10185123	10193129	Yeah, but hopefully they're just not afraid of, like, you know, and I remember hearing an argument before that there's too much parody in there that they're worried about getting sued or something like that.
10193189	10195551	I just, I hope they just get over that, whatever that is.
10196171	10197392	It's a freaking video game.
10197852	10198593	People need to get over it.
10199073	10203236	Alright, well, RPG King, we gotta let you go to get some more calls, but do you have any other final thoughts for our listeners?
10203637	10206219	No, it's just, you know, keep the RPG love alive.
10206459	10207840	Alright, we will try our best.
10208698	10209058	Okay, thanks.
10209078	10209619	All right, take care.
10210299	10213781	Yeah, the less I play MMOs, the more I can play RPGs, so I will do my best.
10214542	10221666	We can probably get one more call in, 1-877-GAME-OLR or Orange Launch Radio on Skype, but really, really one more call.
10223067	10223327	Loki.
10224888	10234654	Anyways, as I was saying, George Costanza from Seinfeld, his fictional Frogger high score is going to be challenged this weekend for whatever reason.
10234694	10234994	I don't know.
10236735	10240896	Also, apparently Nintendo had another handheld system that they finished.
10241316	10242416	However, they're not going to release it.
10243196	10250178	Because, apparently, in the history of Nintendo, there are several examples of such devices like this.
10250558	10255719	But when we are launching new hardware, the most important thing is to sustain the momentum.
10255779	10259480	And if introducing new hardware won't do anything to do that, well...
10261679	10262399	Let me go to the phones.
10262459	10263420	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
10263440	10263800	Who's this?
10264520	10265240	Hey, it's Sterlok.
10265400	10265961	Hi, Sterlok.
10265981	10266881	What's on your mind tonight, buddy?
10267901	10268381	Not a whole lot.
10268401	10269722	Didn't think you guys were doing a show tonight.
10270442	10270942	Surprise!
10271042	10272063	Why wouldn't we do a show tonight?
10273183	10276364	I thought last week you said something about being back in two weeks.
10277044	10277444	You know what?
10277564	10279105	Our anniversary show is in two weeks.
10280085	10282066	Well, maybe that explains our dip in listeners tonight.
10282106	10282406	I don't know.
10282686	10284927	But no, our anniversary show is in two weeks.
10285712	10287032	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
10310412	10319119	It's kind of ironic, because he brought up Month of Three, which is, I think, one of the better RPGs ever made recently.
10320561	10322362	But anyway, there was a fan game.
10324284	10330569	It was kind of a prequel to Earthbound, and it's a full RPG.
10332402	10349547	Um, it's, granted it's not a ROM pack, uh, it's a, you know, it was done in, like, RPG Maker or something, but, you know, it looks halfway decent, and, you know, it uses a bunch of music and sound effects from EarthBound, and, you know, you don't see Nintendo getting all, you know, butthurt over it.
10350714	10352095	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
10373834	10374575	That's what it is.
10375836	10382723	It's no different than logging onto a Harry Potter forum and reading the stories people have invented.
10383825	10389370	If you were going to go by Square's logic, fanfiction.net would not exist.
10392033	10392354	I don't know.
10392414	10394396	It's kind of ridiculous in my opinion.
10395307	10400712	But maybe the problem that they have at Square is the ROM hack element of it.
10400752	10410781	But then again, I guess, you know, but they also have a 3D... But they did try to make it perfectly clear that the ROM image itself would not be included in this thing.
10410821	10411542	It was just a patch.
10412843	10415626	Just like the Mother 3 translation was just a patch.
10416346	10418949	You have to attain the ROM yourself.
10419389	10425650	But maybe it was just the whole fact that it was encouraging the altercation of an intellectual property of Square.
10425710	10426451	Don't get me wrong.
10427411	10430891	I think the whole thing's a little silly, and I don't think they stood to lose anything at all.
10431372	10434192	But maybe they just don't want someone out there competing with themselves.
10434292	10438913	Because it didn't make sense to me until I played Final Fantasy IV the after years.
10438973	10440273	I know what you mean.
10440314	10442254	When you brought that up, I was like, wow, shit, that's a...
10442794	10443574	Really good point.
10444115	10445175	I know what that is.
10446216	10446736	Exactly.
10447076	10447396	I know.
10447516	10447756	I know.
10447796	10452579	It didn't hit me until I played that, and then I was like, oh, I get the lawsuit now.
10453219	10454740	Yeah.
10455520	10455800	All right.
10455840	10457241	Well, hey, thank you so much for the call.
10457261	10460623	We're going to let you go so we can wrap up the show, but we'll see you next week.
10460703	10462263	We will be here next week, just so you know.
10462283	10462924	It's a big show for us.
10463889	10464710	Alright, we'll see you then.
10464730	10465830	Alright, see you.
10465850	10466051	Later.
10466811	10468552	Alright, we're going to go ahead and close up the Skype line.
10468572	10474496	Thanks to you guys so much for calling in, but I keep cutting Loki off every time he tries to finish the story, because... And it's very rude!
10474516	10475156	I'm sorry.
10475597	10483542	But, you know, the callers, we want them to be heard, and I don't like them being on hold for 30 minutes, because then we hear all their background noise, and some of them will start going, Hello?
10483842	10484222	Hello?
10484703	10487665	And you're trying to do a thing, so we try to get to them quickly.
10489266	10489526	Alright.
10491147	10491347	Um...
10493189	10495890	Rock Band, Metal Track Pack Motorhead, Killed By Death
10519062	10531170	Hawkwind, Master of the Universe, Blue Oyster Cult, TransmaniaConMC, Nazareth, Hair of the Dog Arma 2 looks awesome
10550424	10551225	Operation Flashpoint 2 Dragon Rising
10571921	10572861	PC, Arma 2
10596668	10597329	which is kind of funny.
10597409	10599251	So the game needs to be bug tested maybe a little bit.
10599271	10600052	A little bit, but hey.
10600272	10601934	You should post that YouTube in chat because it is really funny.
10601954	10602715	It's pretty funny, yeah.
10603256	10603877	So do that.
10604537	10607401	Sorry to the podcast listeners, you don't get to see that, but you can search for it on YouTube.
10607421	10612827	Just search for Arma 2 and I'm trying to find the funny video.
10613307	10613788	I'll find it.
10615060	10617922	DarkSakura, since you just picked up the mic, what's your final thought tonight?
10617942	10619263	We just got the baby potty trained in time.
10644932	10646352	She is talking about a video game, y'all.
10647493	10647893	Loki.
10648913	10650694	I want to play Arma 2 once it comes out.
10651914	10653595	And it hasn't leaked out yet, unfortunately.
10655055	10658396	My final thought is candy.
10658757	10659557	I want candy.
10659757	10660397	I want sugar.
10660637	10662238	My sweet tooth is bugging me.
10662358	10663458	You can go get us ice cream.
10664178	10664278	Us?
10664879	10665739	Us, yes, us.
10665999	10666099	Us?
10666719	10666819	Us.
10667219	10667519	All right.
10668100	10669180	And, oh, crap.
10670148	10678563	The chatters are reminding me we have not done listless results I can't end the freaking show until we get the listless results God, I almost fired
10681044	10682085	I am really out of it tonight.
10682125	10682685	I'm sorry, guys.
10682705	10683786	I have a lot on my mind today.
10684646	10685867	It's been a very long week for me.
10686007	10689410	So I apologize for my amateur radio hostness.
10689430	10691771	But then I remember I don't get paid for this shit, so deal.
10692131	10692432	All right.
10693132	10693512	Here it is.
10693632	10696034	The top three on tonight's list list.
10696094	10696454	Here it is.
10696634	10697595	Number three.
10698916	10702058	Nintendo franchise you most want to see remade by somebody else.
10702438	10703299	Number three answer.
10703659	10707922	You would like to see Square make a Zelda game is the number three answer.
10708002	10708702	There it is tonight.
10709183	10710524	Your number two answer tonight.
10711845	10714687	Q Entertainment makes a new Tetris game.
10715307	10716568	You kids like your raves.
10716708	10717949	I love this idea, by the way.
10717989	10718609	I want it to happen.
10719090	10722632	And the number one answer tonight for tonight's list list.
10723453	10725734	Team Silent makes Luigi's Mansion.
10727796	10728396	There it is.
10728456	10729297	Your number one answer.
10729337	10730478	That was a joke answer, too.
10730498	10733440	Well, hey, DarkSakura had it down as a real thing, so there it is.
10734100	10740525	That is the definitive list, so somebody contact Akira Yamaoka or the folks at Team Silent and let them know.
10745502	10747865	The vacuum heat is strapped to Luigi's back.
10748346	10750708	He's going back in and maybe he'll meet Pyramid Ed.
10753932	10754233	Love it.
10754813	10755134	All right.
10755354	10757977	Anyhow, that is really going to do it for tonight's show, guys.
10758017	10761361	Change the name of the thing to Luigi Shed His Pants.
10763393	10764153	Mamma Mia!
10765054	10765674	Oh my pants!
10782381	10789246	Now that we actually have people regularly reviewing games and talking about gaming music, which is great, we're no IGN.
10789267	10790728	We're no 1UP or GameSpot.
10791388	10795932	But we are three friends who do this show for you guys, and your support keeps us alive.
10796212	10800756	Please continue to tell your friends about the program and join our little family we have here at Orange Lounge Radio.
10800976	10806600	We'll see you next week for the seven-year anniversary of Orange Lounge Radio.
10807201	10807881	Oh, my God.
10807901	10810523	I need to make sure I can do my class earlier.
10811024	10811244	Oof.
10811817	10812277	We'll see you then
10841222	10842027	See you next week!
