0	20320	Today, June 7th, 2009, we're all here in studio with your phone calls and chat romantics to
20320	31680	discuss this year's highs and lows of E3.
31680	36480	Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
36480	42480	We are that talk show dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer
42480	47760	lifestyle. My name is Rob Roberts, here with you every week. Also say hello to my wonderful co-host,
47760	54560	the one and only Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers. Yo. How are you doing? I am doing okay. I was a little
54560	57760	worried you weren't going to be here tonight at first, but things pulled through and now you're
57760	63280	here. I thought that I had a school orientation and it turns out that I don't. Well that's a good
63280	66560	thing though, right? That means I have it next week. Now you can sit here and party with us.
67120	72720	Yep, it's all parties all the time. All right, or you can play Sims 3. Hey, I can do both at the
72720	76320	same time. All right, no that's fine. All right, also say hello to the one and only Tech Master
76320	81200	Loki. Hello. All right, and Loki's able to do the show and look at porn at the same time. It's
81200	86560	amazing. No, I'm just kidding. Are you looking at porn? Although my wife is adding bookmarks for
86560	94080	porn on my computer, I like to add. Nice. How very, how very thoughtful of her. So, all right,
94080	97840	well how you doing today, Loki? You just, you just got back from LA today, right? Yeah, like
98640	104000	four hours ago. Most people leave E3 like Friday, but you, you stayed over till today to do stuff
104000	110560	with the wife. Yes, and that reminds me, she wanted me to add a few things about E3. She says
110560	116480	E3 sucked because she had to stay in the hotel room, and because the people in the hotel room
116480	120720	had open wi-fi, but for whatever reason she couldn't connect to them, so she couldn't
120720	125120	download the porn fast enough, and then she was also pissed off at my computer because it didn't
125120	129760	have Yahoo Instant Messenger installed on it anymore. That's because it, a Windows update
129760	135280	crashed and I had to reinstall the whole thing. So, that's her complaint about that. Oh, and
135280	140800	Universal sucks, because we went to Universal Studios, and they have no rides, but they have
140800	145840	a tour that apparently wants to abort your baby, and then they also have- Whoa, whoa, whoa, Nelly's
145840	150400	pregnant, so I take a comment like that pretty seriously. Well, it's because the tram rides,
150400	156080	like, it's brutal. The tram rides worsen, like, some of the roller coasters that you go on,
156080	160320	because it's just, like, they have, like, no shocks or suspension on that thing. Did you happen to see
160320	166240	the premiere of Conan O'Brien taking over the Tonight Show, where he did the circling of the
166240	169920	trams? That's like the Mario thing. Oh, yeah, the circling of the trams. The Mario thing was later
169920	173040	in the week. Yeah, he took over. Maybe it was the second night. I don't know. I actually watched
173040	176720	every week, every night of Conan O'Brien this week. I saw the sign to go in there, and I was like,
176720	180880	oh, I want to go in there, but we couldn't, so. What day were you at Universal Studios? We were
180880	184880	there Thursday afternoon. We went there Friday. It's like we kept missing each other the next
184880	191200	few days. That's all right. Well, yeah, Universal Studios sucks. Sorry to hear. I've never been
191200	195520	there. I've never been there. I thought they had, like, a Jurassic Park ride and a Simpsons ride.
195520	200880	Yeah, and a pregnant woman can't ride, and the Simpsons ride pregnant people can't ride that
200880	205520	either. Pregnant women can't ride a lot. I hate to break it to you. I know, but, you know, violent
205520	210960	motions shaking around your belly are not good for twins. Yes, but beside that, though, I mean,
210960	215520	they really only have four rides. They have the Jurassic Park ride, the Mummy Returns ride or
215520	224240	whatever. They have, uh, the Simpsons ride, and there's maybe one other one. I'm not sure,
224240	228480	but that's all they have at Great Am- or at, not Great America. Universal, I mean, come on,
228480	233600	for a theme park, that's pretty shitty. I mean, my only bitch is that Universal City Walk is
233600	238320	extremely overpriced, and by the way, if you don't know what this is, LA, they have, you know,
238320	243840	the Universal Compound right off 101 Freeway. They have this- that's where Universal Studios is,
243840	248560	where Conan O'Brien tapes his show now. It's where they do a lot of special events. It's where the
248560	253600	More Friends concert was a couple years ago. Not Dear Friends, the more- the one More Friends
253600	259760	concert they did at E305 was there at the amphitheater, I think. Yeah, I think it was
259760	265360	05, because 04 was the first Dear Friends, 05 was More Friends, and then, um, they actually have this
265360	269360	big shopping mall there, City Walk. That's where they did the DSi launch, if I'm not mistaken. So
269360	274960	you see these places on TV. Oh, what was the show- what's that show on sci-fi with the, uh, it's like
274960	280000	they call it a video game. It's a show, and it has the bounty hunters chasing you around and all this,
280880	283440	but you have- I know what you're talking about, but I don't remember what it's called. I know
283440	287920	someone in chat's gonna yell it out in any minute. Chat.orangelandrader.com. The one episode of that
287920	291840	show I saw, they actually taped at Universal City Walk, so a lot of people know what this place is,
291840	297520	but it's extremely overpriced. That's, that's all, but I guess, you know, you expect these types of
297520	302960	things are going to be, so yeah. All right, anyhow, enough about, uh, theme park rides and so on. We
302960	306720	have a lot of ground we're going to cover tonight. Here's the interesting thing, and I want to say,
306720	311840	uh, thank you. Chat is now piping up. Chase, Chase, Chase. Everybody's- it's called Chase. All right,
311840	318640	so, um, thank you, chatters. Uh, tonight we have no script, and when I say no script, I don't want you
318640	322240	thinking we plan out everything we're gonna say every week on this show. That's not true. We have
322240	327760	no outline. Yeah, we have no outline. Most shows, like morning shows that you listen to, or, you
327760	331360	know, heck, even the DJs on the radio in the afternoon, they usually have, like, an outline of
331360	336320	topics they're going to talk about. Well, so do we. Not tonight, folks. Uh, there was a moment today
336320	342480	where I thought I might be doing the show by myself, so we didn't end up having an outline at all.
342480	347360	My husband volunteered. Yeah, I know. Dan volunteered. I volunteered him for you. Yeah, but Dan, you know,
347360	352000	does- is not used to having to prepare anything. Dan just comes in here, is funny, and leaves,
352000	355360	you know. That's- that's Dan's role in the show. Sounds like my marriage. We-
357520	361760	I'm sure he'd be very happy to hear that. Can we get him in here to comment on that? No. All right,
361760	366800	so tonight we're just- we have no- I mean, we- I don't know when part A is going to end and part
366800	370960	B is going to begin. We just- we're winging it tonight, but we know we have a lot of ground to
370960	376000	cover with E3 News, so I'm just warning everybody up front. If the show feels a little weird tonight,
376000	382080	it is. So, there you go. All right, let's- well, we know how to start the show. There's only one way
382080	387280	to start the show. So, Dark Sakura, I know sadly you were unable to go to E3. You just got a lot
387280	390560	of other stuff going on in your personal life. You know, we've been listening to the show lately.
390560	393520	You know, you're busy with school. Well, the reason I didn't go to E3 was because of money.
393520	398560	Which, you know, would be a personal life thing, but- I will admit it. Our economy sucks.
398560	402480	It's- it's tough. You know what? E3 was smaller than it was in, oh,
402480	406960	six, when they did the last big one, but I- this is how I've been describing E3 to people.
406960	414240	It was E3 2006 with less Paris Hilton, and that's a great thing. The world with less Paris Hilton
414240	418960	would be a great thing. And- and honestly, the show- the show itself was still- it still felt
418960	423840	big. It still had that feel of E3 2006, but there were a lot less booth babes. That was one thing I
423840	429600	noticed off the top. I mean, a few- Was that a good thing? Well, not necessarily, but my point
429600	434080	I was going to make with that is that I think- I think, honestly, the booth babes may in part be a
434080	439920	victim of the economy. Booth babes are not cheap. It costs a lot for all that silicone. It does.
439920	445280	And I think, in a way, I think a lot of booths cut back on their babes because this year there
445280	449440	was definitely a strictly business feeling about it. You know, people were there to get their shit
449440	455360	done, and- I think that that's better, but you have to have a little flash. And some companies
455360	458400	like Nyko is the one that comes to mind. The ones that have the big inflatable,
458400	461520	the big inflatable Wii controllers. They did have some booth babes.
461520	464400	Nintendo had their- I want a big inflatable Wii controller.
464400	470880	Nintendo didn't have booth babes, but they had the educated, good-looking women that were showing
470880	475280	off. They just were well, you know, they weren't dressed, you know, cheaply. And a couple- I mean,
475280	478640	I'm not saying there weren't any booth babes anywhere. There were the trauma center babes.
478640	482400	I think one of the- I think one of the Capcom games or something had some booth babes. There
482400	487840	just were way less than I saw at E3 2006, and I in part blame the economy. I think-
487840	491040	I don't see that as a bad thing. I think the economy cut back on a lot of those
491040	493760	types of things this year, so- Less silicone, more games.
493760	498080	And zero booth studs that I saw. Well, now that's a travesty.
498080	502640	That is a huge travesty. But anyway- Equal, you know-
502640	504560	Equal opportunity, absolutely. Equal representation.
504560	508720	There's more and more women going to E3, working and doing, you know, things. Women play games.
508720	514640	Sometimes we want booth babes too. Surprise. All right. And you know, I happen to be one of those
514640	518480	guys, so I wouldn't mind seeing some of those booth studs. But I've learned to just accept
518480	522400	that's not going to happen. So whatever. Well, it is fun harassing the booth babes though.
522400	527280	All right. Anyhow, let's get into your gaming week. Besides E3, how was your gaming week?
527840	531120	I did what I'm doing right now. Which is?
531120	533840	Playing Sims. Now not just old school Sims.
533840	536240	Sims 3. So you at least played a new game.
536240	545040	Oh yes. And we've actually had full reviews posted on it on the blog I contribute to that
545040	553680	Tara keeps at AvengersTower.com. She reviewed the game itself. I reviewed the exchange in the store
553680	558720	and the house mechanics. You know me, I love building the houses. I'm building the Avengers
558720	560960	mansion right now. Well, so give us a little synopsis.
560960	564640	What makes this game special compared to previous installments in the franchise?
564640	568720	It's new and really that's not very special right now. I mean a lot of the play in it is
569600	576720	improved. You can put diagonal furniture and change a few things. The build a house mode
576720	581280	is a lot better. You can definitely customize your body shapes a bit more. But see there's
581280	585840	a problem is that the faces are butt ugly and it takes a lot of adjustment to get them not butt
585840	596880	ugly and they have no chins. What are all the other complaints back and forth? Oh yeah bad
596880	603440	hair. Pretty much what I want is I want them to have a way to import all the Sims 2 customization
603440	608640	into Sims 3. Although they are working on it they have already figured out how to unlock some stuff
608640	613040	and we've got a few new skins in there and hopefully we'll get better hair because the
613040	619040	hair in the game sucks and you can actually buy points to use in their store. They've got some
619040	624320	neat stuff in the store but the only thing that I was actually super excited about was like a lamp
625200	630320	and a bathtub because it was a really cool bathtub. Sounds like a trip to IKEA. I want
630320	637600	an IKEA pack. Sims 2 had IKEA packs. I want an IKEA pack. For real? Yeah. There's a huge Sims
637600	642160	culture. I think a lot of times you know because our show we try to touch on PC gaming and I think
642160	646880	we do to an extent but I think you know I'll admit it we stay pretty focused on consoles and I think
646880	653200	sometimes even the PC gamers we neglect how huge the Sims franchise is. This isn't the Sims like
653200	658800	the best-selling PC game ever? I wouldn't say. I'm pretty sure it is. So there there's this huge
658800	662320	culture around it. I would have never guessed however that there was actually IKEA packs for
662320	667280	Sims 2. That's hilarious. Yeah I mean the whole the whole part the whole thing about the Sims is
667280	673440	that you know especially through cheating like me um you can have all kinds of neat stuff happen you
673440	679520	you know for people like they had um on Sims 2 people would do like whole Star Trek packages
679520	685920	and even recreated the ships. It's really also a big just general fandom outlet too. It's really
685920	692160	got so much to do um and if anyone is interested- Is there a furries pack for furry fandom?
692160	699040	Not yet but uh people have tried um but if you want to look on the exchange I've put up all of
699040	703360	not all of everything but a lot of the stuff that I've made so far just look up I'm on there is Dark
703360	709840	Sakura. You can see like a house I built which I forgot to put a certain door to the balcony so no
709840	715200	one can go on the balcony. Now speaking of exchange I don't think Sims 2 had this. This
715200	719920	sounds more like what Spore had where you can publish all your creations to the web right?
719920	726320	You could do it with Sims 2 they had um you know where you could post up your stuff but you had to
726320	730080	of course register your game and really they didn't have anything on there that you couldn't get
730080	737280	anywhere else you know once the um big mod forums came out um which I actually I'll go ahead and
737280	742320	plug my favorite right now modthesims.com um they're probably the best one out there.
743120	745840	So overall with Sims 3 all you were hoping for and more?
745840	752720	I really had very little in the way of expectation so um I like it I'm not displeased with it I like
752720	758800	that you can if like like if the floor or something is like butt ugly you can just change it and you
758800	765360	can like I will you can actually go in and any of the the floors that you lay down you can actually
765360	771680	go back in and change the color of them like um this little uh tool that I have here is a palette
771680	778960	tool and you can go in if it will let me and actually change the various colors in it by
779680	785760	sliding the little slider and it'll change all the colors and then you can just copy that one
785760	789680	and paste it all over the place it's really neat I've done a few custom floors myself.
789680	794080	I'm reading some chat comments chat dot orange laundry dot com decipher is in chat and wants
794080	798640	to clarify Sims 2 had it it just wasn't as intuitive I believe talking about the whole
798640	806240	web interface this is this is actually super easy like um oh come on you butt head she's getting
806240	812160	error messages I talk to I talk to my games all the time that's right um for example I'm just
812160	820480	gonna show you with um a piece of furniture like say that I put this um stupidly ugly bed
821520	828160	right here and I hate that the stupidly ugly bed is stupidly ugly so I want to change it so I hit
828160	834640	my little um palette thing oh my god it is an ugly bed um and then I can go through and say
834640	840880	you know what I really hate this rose pattern thing I want this leaf pattern instead so I
840880	846640	can pick the leaf pattern as soon as all this other crap loads and my computer's a little
846640	852080	taxed of course because I have everything running for the show um but it will change the bedspread
852080	860160	too it seems to me that you play sims really for the design element you really like to design the
860160	865200	houses you like to design the furniture and color every little piece is there stuff there because I
865200	869440	suck at designing is there something in this game for me is there actual game to play well you can
869440	874880	just pick a house you can download houses that other people have done after you've murdered the
874880	881680	family no you can you have empty lots and you can evict people and right now it's still thinking
881680	885920	about changing that bedspread to green but what would happen is I would save it here and then I
885920	892560	would pick share and then when I go in you have this other thing that's called the um the launcher
893440	896480	which is the first thing that loads up when you does that launch sims
898000	906240	out of a cannon sorry it's mod the sims info by the way um the site um but then you go into this
906960	910320	and you can actually those are screenshots up there but you can select
910320	914960	that one of the items that you've saved specifically for sharing and click upload
914960	920320	and almost instantly it's on the exchange for you and everybody else in the universe to see
920320	924240	all the crap that you've managed to make and again kind of like spores creature creator kind
924240	927520	of reminds me of that and of course everything that you've picked for download and this also
927520	933280	works now for the content that that's up on uh mod the sims right now is that you just click on
933280	938400	the little pack and it loads it into this and you can choose to install it in your game it's pretty
938400	942080	it's pretty neat i think it's pretty neat all right well maybe i'll have to check that out a
942080	946960	little later so it's it's worth it i think it's worthwhile well let's move on and talk about more
946960	953280	gaming weeks uh loki but oh finally it changed to that green pattern it's camo uh loki besides the
953280	956160	stuff you played at e3 because we'll have plenty of time for that in a little bit how was your
956160	963680	gaming week i played fuel more fuel at least in um it was fun you know still driving around trying
963680	971520	to get um more stuff unlocked really just trying to drive around get collect more uh fuel containers
971520	978960	to unlock more cars but man that game is big i like i'm gonna spend one of these days actually
978960	984480	just trying to drive across the whole map but it probably will take a whole day because it's that
984480	990080	big it seems um yeah i'm looking at some of the reviews of that game because i'm considering
990080	994400	picking it up it seems like it's getting very average reviews that people don't think i guess
994400	998080	the implementation is good or something i don't know what people's problems is with it but it's
998080	1007520	all right i don't know it's nothing really like it you know and um well the next racing game similar
1007520	1013920	to it's going to be dirt too and that's not out until september so actually there's no rule
1013920	1021040	racing games i think coming out until september other than fuel which has already come out so
1022560	1028800	yeah i don't know anything else besides the e3 stuff uh more grand theft auto 4 that's about it
1028800	1033840	of course um my gaming week obviously with e3 kind of uh you know being this week there wasn't
1033840	1038720	a whole lot i played outside of e3 but i will tell you once i got home one of the first things
1038720	1041760	i wanted to do well i did play a little bit of fall past 11 because i mentioned in a previous
1041760	1045840	show i'd gone back to it i haven't played a whole lot but i did finally have my first experience
1045840	1049760	party and uh yeah the level sync's pretty cool you don't have to worry about everybody being
1049760	1054000	you know a certain level range anymore you just kind of do your thing uh so it makes it a lot
1054000	1058480	easier just kind of hit the ground and get started i do notice though you do still sometimes have to
1058480	1062160	wait a while for people to show up and stuff i have yet to see i hear there's more stuff you can
1062160	1068080	do duo and trio i've yet to really see that but um hopefully hopefully i'll see that a little more
1068080	1072640	you know to be fair i haven't played a whole lot of hours in this game uh because e3 got in the
1072640	1076560	way and right as soon as i got home from e3 one thing i wanted to do i was like you know i kind
1076560	1080880	of want to go play final fantasy 7 because that just came out you know on the whole playstation
1080880	1085440	3 i haven't played that game in years my discs are so scratched up they don't work anymore so
1085440	1088720	i think i want to go play final fantasy 7 and then as i was downloading it after paying the
1088720	1094560	10 to download it i realized oh crap final fantasy 4 the after years came out this week
1094560	1099920	i have got to go play that because final fantasy 4 is like my favorite final fantasy ever at least
1099920	1106160	the one i have the most like nostalgia with you know because that was my first real in-depth
1106160	1109360	final fantasy game that i just got totally immersed with i mean i remember playing the
1109360	1113840	very first one on the nes when i was like nine or ten years old i don't remember how old i was
1113840	1119600	but i remember playing that very first one on the nes and it was cool but um i didn't really get
1119600	1126240	immersed until final fantasy 2 here in the us which as we all know is really 4 so finally i i
1126240	1131040	i'm very excited to hear the sequel came out and it's on cell phones so i checked out final
1131040	1138400	fantasy 4 the after years on the wii and uh yeah my nostalgia strings were successfully tugged
1138400	1146160	i was kind of surprised at how much of just kind of a reskinning of final fantasy 4 a lot of it
1146160	1152000	was i mean i'm not even joking like the same overworld map a lot of the same like city maps
1152000	1157600	i mean some of the dungeon maps are new but pretty much the same city maps same music um now granted
1157600	1161440	they gave it those little minor upgrades that you know it kind of gets when it's when they're coming
1161440	1164720	over to the wii but basically i felt like i was playing something on virtual console but of course
1164720	1169680	i had to remind myself okay rob you are playing a port of a cell phone game so i mean i guess if
1169680	1172800	i could compare it to anything it would be very similar to playing like final fantasy 4 on game
1172800	1176800	boy advance or wonder swan color like you know that kind of like slightly souped up
1176800	1182880	upgrade from the original super nintendo one um but here's the interesting thing about it
1182880	1188880	is that it's it's episodic so what you're paying i think it was what 800 wii points i think to
1188880	1193520	download the game what you're buying is really only about five or six hours worth of game oh
1193520	1199920	wonderful if you go if you want to get these seven other episodes with the spin-off characters
1199920	1204960	they're like 300 wii points each and then the final chapter is supposed to be another 800 points
1204960	1209760	but i guess they're rolling this out slowly like there's a side story on ridia out now i haven't
1209760	1214400	really played it yet i i plan to though um and then once you complete all these side stories
1214400	1219040	you can use the characters from the side stories in the closing chapter is what i hear is supposed
1219040	1225040	to happen so i mean that's kind of cool here's here's the thing it plays and feels like final
1225040	1230240	fantasy 4 on the super nintendo not on the ds no voice acting nothing i mean it plays and feels
1230240	1235760	so if you want an old school super nintendo rpg if that's what you've been clamoring for if that's
1235760	1241920	what you miss much like you appealed to mega man or mega man 9 appealed to you because you missed
1241920	1247200	the old school nes mega man games then you will like final fantasy 4 the after years but if this
1247200	1252720	isn't the type of game you grew up on and stuff and maybe this isn't you know 2d rpgs aren't your
1252720	1257200	thing you might kind of find this game to be a little bit of a rip and i will tell you for only
1257200	1262160	six hours worth of gameplay it's it's a bit of a challenge for me to wholeheartedly endorse this
1262160	1267120	but i go you know what it's a fairly well written story at least what i've gotten into so far
1267840	1273040	just just playing it all over again is is kind of making me giddy i actually kind of
1273040	1275920	am having a lot of fun with it and that's what really games are all about so if you
1275920	1280800	want the nostalgia final fantasy 4 all over again definitely go check this out but you know what
1280800	1287200	this made me think about as i was playing it here's the thing what what what really made me
1287200	1291200	think about uh this was this whole story that we've been covering on the show the last couple
1291200	1295440	weeks you know how square shut down that chrono trigger fan project remember how somebody was
1295440	1299920	making this chrono trigger rom for the super nintendo that was like it was like using the
1299920	1303520	old chrono trigger data but it was like a news story and all this stuff remember this and square
1303520	1307120	sent them a cease and desist letter and we were like you bastards why did you shut down this
1307120	1310920	project it was just a fan thing I realized this week they shut it down
1310920	1314760	because that's what they did with Final Fantasy for the after years that's what
1314760	1322440	it is it's a reskin Final Fantasy 4 with new dialogue new stuff it didn't hit me
1322440	1328920	until now square before us huh yes in a way I mean even though this game's
1328920	1332520	already been out in Japan on cell phones for a while I think that's why they shut
1332520	1336440	the chrono trigger project down if this Final Fantasy 4 thing is successful I
1336440	1342160	betcha they're gonna do one for chrono trigger it's probably cheap to do so
1342160	1346040	there's yeah that's why it got shut down it is cheap to do it's all is is
1346040	1351040	programming you know scenarios and you know no real sprite creating since you've
1351040	1355600	already you're using the same sprites just creating a few world maps already
1355600	1359360	spread to be fair and Henderson Henderson man says this in chat there are
1359360	1363600	new characters and yes there are some new characters the guards wedge and I
1363600	1367200	always thought it was Vicks but it's now bigs in this game maybe that has
1367200	1371200	somebody to do the translation play bigger roles in this game see a door is
1371200	1375080	a new character so to be fair there are some new sprites of new characters and
1375080	1379160	things but a lot of recycled monsters I don't think I've run into a single new
1379160	1382920	monster yet I mean they're all monsters from the old game I mean and some new
1382920	1388640	maps like Devil's Road which is the road that connects massidia and Baron you
1388640	1393000	used to just go in there and it will be and you appear in Baron well now they've
1393000	1396200	actually made like I don't I don't think this is very spoilery and I apologize if
1396200	1399920	you feel it is but they've made a little dungeon to go with the connection now
1399920	1404600	that you have to work your way through so to say they have just only reskinned
1404600	1409720	it that's that wouldn't be a fair thing to say they have done minor tweaks but
1409720	1412880	I'm telling you you're gonna play this game and you're gonna be like I feel
1412880	1417360	like I'm playing Final Fantasy 4 plus I feel like I've popped in my Final
1417360	1422000	Fantasy 2 with two cartridge from the Super Nintendo and unlocked a whole like
1422000	1426360	secret level that wasn't there that's what it feels like and that's why this
1426360	1429400	chrono trigger fan project got shut down because maybe this is the direction
1429400	1436000	square setting it let's see the Rob D and chat says the translator Final
1436000	1440000	Fantasy 6 apparently wasn't a Star Wars fan well all the Super Nintendo Final
1440000	1443160	Fantasy yeah I remember it was it was something to do with Star Wars always
1443160	1446000	bigs and wedge that's right okay so thank you Rob D that's right Vicks was a
1446000	1450440	mr. mistranslation in the American Final Fantasy 2 and 3 they did Vicks what
1450440	1454800	instead of wedge but but or and instead of bigs so it makes sense I figured it
1454800	1459600	was something like that as well but not in seven mm-hmm remember were they in
1459600	1465880	that game they weren't they might have been like yeah they usually show up as
1465880	1470920	guards somewhere black wolf our good buddy who celebrated his 200th episode
1470920	1474720	right before we went live tonight says and chat hell telltale does the same
1474720	1479520	thing and we love them and 300 points isn't that bad it's really not 300
1479520	1483640	points for a couple hours worth of gameplay I think is worth it but you
1483640	1487280	know I just understand you're gonna be spending your money on something old
1487280	1491520	school if you're spoiled by all these newfangled 3d graphics and things I
1491520	1495640	don't know if there's a lot here for you but if you love Final Fantasy 4 as much
1495640	1499520	as I do you're gonna love this I think I think it's definitely worth the price
1499520	1503240	and and quite honestly I think all the add-ons will probably be worth it too
1503240	1507280	hell I saw a great argument the other day on a forum or something Final
1507280	1512560	Fantasy 2 as a cartridge when it came out was like $70 okay it was like $70
1512560	1517560	and this was back in what 91 so that's probably like $100 by today's standards
1517560	1524040	so you know the nickel and diming doesn't feel quite so bad here so there
1524040	1526920	you go and Henderson man and Chad apparently is a fan of the game and says
1526920	1530880	and that's what I wanted from the after years by the way Rydia story is about
1530880	1534840	three is three dollars for about four hours so yeah I mean don't get me wrong
1534840	1537920	I'm not slamming the game for what they doin it's just you know know what you're
1537920	1541400	getting into I was caught a little off guard I was expecting it to be kind of
1541400	1545120	like newer and fancier but now that I'm kind of playing it I'm like you know
1545120	1549120	there's a part of me that's kind of glad it's not it is kind of neat to revisit
1549120	1556120	that game I loved literally loved you know 15 years ago 15 18 years ago so I
1556120	1561560	do endorse Final Fantasy for the after years if you are a fan of Final Fantasy
1561560	1568600	for it all um Rob D in chat says yes but times are different now why should we
1568600	1572120	judge it by antiquated pricing not to say it's not worth it I just don't think
1572120	1577000	that's a good argument fair enough I see your point but you know there's a lot of
1577000	1580760	crap out there they are trying to charge this five and ten dollars and do some of
1580760	1584800	this episodic money for I think you know again if you know what you're getting
1584800	1589200	into if you know you want that Final Fantasy for old-school nostalgia you
1589200	1593720	know not a lot of people complain about Mega Man 9 I think it's gonna be worth
1593720	1599000	it so all right and separate 1215 says that's nothing I think Phantasy Star 4
1599000	1602440	was like $100 that's true that was a really expensive Genesis game it was
1602440	1607160	this crazy Street Fighter 2 and Mortal Kombat when they first came out for the
1607160	1610240	Super Nintendo were also extremely expensive if I remember I remember
1610240	1614400	paying $65 for killer instinct that actually isn't even the most I've ever
1614400	1618200	spent for a Nintendo cartridge super Nintendo cartridge I did import the
1618200	1623320	Sailor Moon super s fighting game for a hundred and ten bucks cool my early days
1623320	1627240	of importing yeah did you get import game is a whole nother story so there
1627240	1632000	you go so Henderson man kind of concludes this is the last thing I want
1632000	1635080	to say on the Final Fantasy 4 after years well think of it like this the
1635080	1639520	total price for Final Fantasy 4 the after years is $37 for the full game
1639520	1643880	about the same price as a DS game remake and that's true and you know what and in
1643880	1647400	the end when you add up all these hours that would be what like 21 and it
1647400	1650560	probably about 30 hours of gameplay which is about what you get out of a DS
1650560	1655400	cartridge anyway so you know but just again not going to be your cutting-edge
1655400	1660200	graphics think Mega Man 9 but Final Fantasy that's all I'm saying I'd pay
1660200	1666400	for it seriously I I I I my nostalgia strings are extremely tickled by this
1666400	1672400	game extremely and I hear the story gets really good I'm really avoiding spoilers
1672400	1676920	I am I'm probably only about an hour and a half two hours into the main episode
1676920	1683160	I know I have plenty more to go but I'm I'm I'm squealing so far are you
1683160	1690000	squealing in a girly manner a little bit of both all right anyhow let's uh let's
1690000	1694000	move on and get into some housekeeping tonight housekeeping we are slowly
1694000	1698040	getting the podcast caught up after our storage drive to corruption we're almost

1755200	1759320	our YouTube channel after like two or three years we'll finally get some new
1759320	1764880	content we did take video on the e3 show floor we got me singing karaoke revolution
1764880	1768720	the new DDR games yeah second so there will be some stuff going to the orange
1768720	1773640	looking incredibly bored playing the new DDR game because it's incredibly boring
1773640	1779040	all right well let's get to it let's talk e3 let's talk about e3 and and how
1779040	1782320	it all went down we have no script tonight so let's just kind of I guess
1782320	1785800	since you brought up DDR let's start with the music games it's where our fan
1785800	1789520	you know the the fans have been listening to us for seven years know us from way
1789520	1792800	back then let's talk about music games because there's been some very good
1792800	1797920	music games at e3 some very bad music games at e3 and some very non-existent
1797920	1801880	music games at e3 that's where I want to start where the hell was DJ hero isn't
1801880	1805120	this game supposed to be out in a couple months it was shown behind closed doors
1805120	1810960	well how nice did they let people play it they had it demoed on a live stage
1810960	1814320	they had demoed in front of a crowd and that was pretty cool but they didn't get
1814320	1819480	they didn't let people play it and I'm what are they trying to hide I don't
1819480	1823320	know is the game not done yet are there songs that are there trying to be you
1823320	1826880	know I did they not want people breaking the peripheral out on the show floor I
1826880	1833480	I could be wrong chatters please correct me if I'm wrong is DJ hero isn't DJ
1833480	1837900	hero getting released this summer it's getting released this fall okay so there
1837900	1841080	are still a few months out so maybe they are still making some fine in October
1841080	1845760	okay October I thought it was out in June October 20th scratch was supposed
1845760	1849980	to be out in June that's why I thought that yet scratch scratch I did not see
1849980	1853880	in the show floor at all I got up to leave trouble I heard it was there
1853880	1858680	though but I didn't get to see it I've already kind of seen it so you know
1858680	1864720	whatever um let's see so so there's not a lot to say on DJ hero huge booth to
1864720	1870240	put on music and play these you know DJ here oh and do this now stuff granted DJ
1870240	1874200	hero wasn't you know available to play which is too bad because there have been
1874200	1878580	lines everywhere for that stuff but neither was rest of like activisions
1878580	1883640	kind of music tiles no guitar hero 5 no guitar hit well guitar o van Halen was
1883640	1888960	around guitar hero van Halen was at Sony's booth yes yes but not activisions
1888960	1894920	no guitar hero PSP which was a kind of a you know slipped under the radar there
1894920	1899920	no band hero but they had a trailer for that although I didn't see it I just
1899920	1907360	know that they did but they had it on stage they were demoing on stage and DJ
1907360	1913240	hero looks sweet yeah I mean don't be wrong DJ hero looks great but it looks
1913240	1917800	fun to play it I want to play it I do want to get my hands on it and see for
1917800	1921200	myself I understand I guess that's what I'm trying to do maybe that's what
1921200	1924280	they're trying to do is leave it a mystery for all of us but I don't I just
1924280	1927360	I don't know I still get frustrated at e3 when I see these like millions of
1927360	1932080	dollars spent to like you know do this big DJ hero show for what I don't know
1932080	1936000	behind closed doors for speciality white 100% behind it yeah because you know
1936000	1940360	before they were only showing half the controller like what the hell and you
1940360	1943200	know before that you're probably you know people were there expecting people
1943200	1946440	to go oh my goodness you know what is this you know this looks so cool you
1946440	1949840	know I'll learn more about it but people were just kind of going how are you
1949840	1953160	gonna play this this this looks dumb what are they doing you know and then
1953160	1957600	they finally you know just during e3 they finally released the rest of the
1957600	1961800	pictures of you know what the actual controller was you know beside the fact
1961800	1966500	it was in game informer but you know actually having it free to look at
1966500	1973560	outside of game in former you know they just put up the stuff for it but yeah I
1973560	1977760	mean it looks cool and I like watching it being performed and they did it they
1977760	1981600	did both just you know an actual song that they did the one that they had the
1981600	1987600	Beastie Boys mash-up thing where the guy was playing the guitar. Both of them look pretty cool, but um...
1988400	1992480	I don't know. I mean, besides, you know, being able to play it, I mean, it looks cool.
1993960	1999400	Um, all right, so we had Guitar Hero, and yeah, Van Halen, I guess, was confirmed or whatever.
1999400	2001400	Yeah, it was already coming out. We already knew it.
2003600	2010320	Scratch was nowhere to be seen. All right, Konami's booth, they had the new DDR and games on the Wii and the
2010320	2015660	PlayStation 2. Did you hear what they're doing with DDR? No, what? Oh, you're gonna love this.
2016440	2022120	Can I mini rant? Why don't I do my mini rant, and then you can piss me off even more what you're about to say.
2022240	2023440	Okay?
2023440	2028660	Keep in mind, folks, this show would not exist if it weren't for DDR.
2028660	2036000	I love what DDR has done for my life and the people it's introduced me to and all of this stuff. That being said,
2036000	2041240	I went to go play DDR at Konami's booth on the PlayStation 2 and on the Wii.
2041240	2046000	I cannot tell these fucking games apart anymore. Like, I don't even know what it's called.
2046000	2050880	I didn't even bother to look up the name because it's the same fucking thing as last year with just different songs.
2051040	2055620	That is what DDR has turned into. It's everybody's worst fear that we all kind of, you know, and
2056200	2061260	a couple years ago when some of these games were new, people were kind of heckling and saying,
2061260	2067380	this is just gonna turn into like a sports game where it's just, you know, it's the roster update 2009.
2067380	2069380	It's just new songs.
2069420	2071420	I apologize. You were right.
2071500	2079300	You were right. That's what the franchise has turned into. It's roster update 2009 with new songs. I see nothing here to report on.
2080660	2082660	Rihanna's in it. Whoopee!
2083580	2088140	On the Wii one, you can now play on the balance board and shake your hips. Yay!
2088140	2092900	That is new. That is something legitimately new. It is new and it is stupid.
2092900	2099740	I agree. I agree with the stupid part, but hey, it is new. Then, not only that, not, okay,
2099740	2106340	so it would piss off fans enough that they didn't really do anything with the song list, that song list sucks, and that, you know,
2106340	2109740	the songs that they've just brought back a bunch of older songs and stuff like that.
2110300	2114460	That would be fine as it is. Oh, but they didn't leave it there.
2114460	2120620	No, let's piss people off by taking Dynamite Rave and changing the lyrics to it, making it even worse.
2120620	2122780	I hate to tell you, but they already did that. Download the DDR for the iPhone.
2122780	2126620	You can download Brilliant 2U with lyrics, and it'll make your inner Bamani fanboy cry.
2127740	2133620	Well, it's still sad. I'm just, I'm just, I'm done. That's how long it's been since I played it. I've given up on Konami.
2133620	2139420	I've given up on these games. I officially give up. But Rob, how can they possibly innovate this game?
2139420	2141860	Can I, can I read, can I read these comments from chat real fast?
2141860	2148860	Comments from chat, act deft. Eight arrows for the 360 and PS3. Alpha-Cananagram, did you try PS3 360 version with eight arrow pad?
2148860	2150380	No, it was not on the floor.
2150380	2154980	Nope, and they did have that, and Technomotion did it first.
2154980	2163100	You know what, though? I don't care. Technomotion was shit. If you ever actually played Technomotion, it was fucking garbage.
2163100	2168580	Okay? It's the one game everybody talked about back in the day, like, hey, I played Technomotion, because nobody had it.
2168580	2176260	Why? Because it was fucking garbage. So, okay, fine, if this is how DDR is gonna innovate with the eight arrow pad, whatever, let's see the goods.
2176260	2180460	Maybe I'll change my mind. I'm not convinced adding four more arrows is gonna make it any more fun.
2180460	2181900	It's not gonna make it any more fun.
2181900	2184820	Oh, is that what you were gonna tell me is gonna piss me off even more?
2184820	2193340	Yes. Because it's not gonna make it more fun, because they don't understand. They don't understand what, seriously, they need someone to kick their ass.
2193340	2200700	It's because they don't really get it. They're trying to focus this game on, you know, the casual audience, the people that picked this up.
2200700	2209220	But the problem is, you know, you had an install base already, and all you're doing is like, okay, screw this install base, because they're gonna buy whatever we put out,
2209220	2214180	because, you know, everybody keeps telling them, oh, buy Konami products, and then they'll, you know, put out more.
2214180	2220180	But people aren't doing that anymore, and so now you're going after these new people instead of trying to recapture the fans.
2220180	2224900	You already had your base right there. If you kept them happy, you would be selling enough each year.
2224900	2229700	News slash, Konami does not care about the DDR fan base, because we all got old.
2229700	2234660	It's been 10 years, and we're all too old to dance now, so they are going after children.
2234660	2241060	I mean, that's what it is. I hate to break it to you folks. Konami does not care. You're all 30 now.
2241060	2249220	Konami does not care about you anymore. You're all gonna have kids, and they want your kids playing DDR. That's where it's at.
2249220	2257220	The thing they need to remember is that we, for all of us who grew up gamers, we're not gonna buy shit for our kids.
2257220	2261540	We're not gonna buy them crappy games. We're gonna buy them stuff that we'll want to play too.
2261540	2265220	But the thing, I mean, I was even thinking about this on the ride over here today.
2265220	2270100	Like, the problem with Konami is they don't get what makes their games sell.
2270100	2276020	It's basically, you know, with DDR, it was all about the music and kind of the surprises.
2276020	2281380	Like, with each different mix, they were adding something that was kind of new that was surprising.
2281380	2283620	Like, the freeze arrows and stuff, that was kind of surprising for us.
2283620	2287540	There was a new element in there that got people interested, but it wasn't just the gimmicks.
2287540	2293300	It was also the soundtrack, because the soundtrack had core elements that, you know, the fans could rely on.
2293300	2300180	You know, there was gonna be a dance meeting attraction. You know, there was gonna be some good, you know, in-house music that they would have done.
2300180	2308180	You know, new challenge songs and stuff like that, and new elements thrown in there. But now, they don't really want to do any of that.
2308180	2314420	So what they're gonna do is, and I'm not even, you know, I'm with you. I don't even know what the hell they're calling this game, because it just said Dance Dance Revolution.
2314420	2315460	I don't care!
2315460	2317300	Nor do I, yeah. I don't care either, but-
2317300	2320900	I don't want to tell you what it's called. Honestly.
2320900	2327300	As a journalist, or whatever you- yeah, right. You know, whatever. As a blogger, pod, whatever the fuck I am.
2327300	2330980	As me, I don't want to tell you what it's called, because I don't care.
2330980	2337860	That's the point I've gotten to with these games. I know people work very hard on them. Again, you know, I-
2337860	2342100	No, they don't work very hard on them! I'm sorry! I don't see it!
2342100	2346420	Well, here's the thing. Here's the thing. And tell me if I- I think this chatter is absolutely right.
2346420	2352020	Sephiroth1215 says, no, they don't care anymore because Jason Enos is gone. That's when DDR went downhill. That's true.
2352020	2352740	I ran into him-
2352740	2353780	That is exactly it.
2353780	2356260	I ran into him a few months ago, actually. He works at EA now.
2356260	2357460	He doesn't work with them anymore.
2357460	2359460	Well, he also saw the games live.
2359460	2365700	Yeah, so, I mean, he's, you know, not there anymore, and you're right. He was really tapped into the family.
2365700	2367860	He used me so my Sims 3 is good now.
2367860	2372900	I don't know if I can say what game he's been working on, but I- well, it's- well, I don't know.
2372900	2378740	Anyway, but it's more casual games, I guess, is what he's doing now. Maybe we'll get him on the show at some point.
2378740	2383940	I'll shoot an email or something. But, yeah, you know, obviously that was huge.
2383940	2388660	Well, not just that, but the whole San Francisco office shut down, and that's where a lot of the fans were working on the steps.
2388660	2389780	I mean, that was huge.
2389780	2394020	I don't buy that, oh, well, you know, there's people working hard in this game.
2395460	2398660	Well, that's pretty sad, then, if this is the best you can do.
2398660	2404580	I mean, because really, all he did was just recycle the whole engine again, maybe change some assets to it,
2404580	2407460	and just said, okay, what songs are we gonna throw in there now?
2407460	2411700	All right, here's the licensed songs we want. Okay, let's see what else we can fill up the song list with.
2411700	2413380	All right, so, look, moving on.
2413380	2415380	It was our game to advertise their music.
2415380	2417860	Dance Dance Revolution, awesome if you're 7.
2417860	2426420	Okay, so, by the way, if you need further proof that Konami does not care about the fans from 10 years ago,
2426420	2429220	look at what they did to Papa Music on the Wii, right?
2429220	2434740	They're relaunching Papa Music with this whole new control scheme and, I guess, song lists and stuff.
2434740	2439620	They say 150 classic tracks will be downloadable at launch.
2439620	2440900	Is this the new PS3 one?
2440900	2441400	Yes.
2441400	2444360	I, to be fair, I might check it out.
2445080	2452440	The Nostalgia Fanboy in me kind of is curious, but it's a thin line with me right now that they're walking.
2453320	2453960	Thin line.
2453960	2455960	You want to see the nature of the train wreck?
2455960	2460360	Anyhow, because I love DDR at its core.
2460360	2463320	That's why I get so impassioned about looking at where it's at now.
2463320	2467480	It's really frustrating when it really isn't that hard to turn this thing around,
2467480	2468840	but they just don't want to do it.
2468840	2473160	Anyhow, Karaoke Revolution was also at Konami's booth.
2473160	2476200	I was surprised at how current the song list was, because they had, like,
2476200	2479640	My Life Will Suck Without You, Just Dance by Lady Gaga.
2479640	2481240	They did have some current tracks.
2481240	2485640	But, honestly, to me, it felt like the same game we had on the PlayStation 2,
2485640	2492040	without the American Idol stuff now, just with, you know, 720p, slightly souped-up engine.
2492040	2494360	I didn't see a lot of new stuff in there.
2494360	2497480	I imagine they're going to have the download store like every other music game now.
2497480	2499400	Again, you know, and you might think,
2499400	2503560	Why do I need this when I have Sing Star or when I have Rock Band?
2503560	2505720	Well, A, you're going to get more pop songs than this.
2505720	2509160	So I guess its closest competition is really the Sing Star and Lips Games.
2509160	2510680	And probably the Lips Games suck.
2510680	2515160	And, well, they actually were debuting a new one on the floor that looked really nice.
2515160	2519480	I mean, I think the Lips Game looks better than Karaoke Revolution,
2519480	2524520	but I have a feeling Karaoke Revolution is going to be more of a robust jukebox by the time it's done,
2524520	2527640	which is kind of sad because Sony owns their own record label.
2527640	2532920	But when you look at what's available on Sing Star, it's very narrow,
2532920	2537960	especially when you consider that most of it is UK-based music, which isn't a bad thing.
2537960	2539480	They have some great music over there,
2539480	2542600	but not a lot of tunes that are going to be a big hit at parties here in the US,
2542600	2543800	because nobody's going to know them.
2544680	2546920	So that is a fair point.
2547480	2551320	Anyhow, I think that's where Karaoke Revolution may win some people over,
2551320	2555160	because I think there's a lot of people who haven't taken the plunge into Sing Star or Lips
2555160	2558280	that might still be able to get brought on board with Karaoke Revolution.
2558280	2559160	I don't know.
2559160	2561400	I do have nice things to say about Konami.
2561400	2563960	One of my favorite games of the show was at their booth,
2563960	2567800	but before we get to that, I want to talk about one of my favorite games of the show, Period,
2567800	2570680	which was a music game, Beatles Rock Band.
2570680	2574200	Yes! Oh my god, I saw the trailer.
2574200	2577400	Everybody's talking about that introduction and how amazing it is.
2577400	2581560	And let me tell you, the game itself looks just awesome.
2581560	2584440	Loki, I don't know, you want to talk about our experience at Beatles Rock Band?
2584440	2587960	Well, I mean, the thing everybody's harping on, you know,
2587960	2592920	harmonics and both Activision and that kind of stuff, and EA,
2593560	2598440	is that they're taking these band-specific games
2598440	2601000	and they're kind of whoring out their franchise.
2601000	2603880	Well, the thing with Beatles Rock Band is a little bit different
2603880	2605720	than, say, what they're doing with the Guitar Hero stuff.
2605720	2609560	The Guitar Hero games, they're coming out, they're kind of adding, you know,
2609560	2614760	they're re-skinning it a little bit, you know, and adding the artists that they're focusing on,
2614760	2620200	or, you know, greatest hits or, you know, or smash hits or just some generic stuff.
2620200	2623560	But with Beatles Rock Band, they have actually completely redone the game.
2623560	2627160	Similar with, actually, Lego Rock Band, a little bit.
2627160	2630520	But with Beatles Rock Band, they've redone the whole style of the game.
2630520	2635480	It's kind of this, you know, very stylized version of stuff.
2635480	2639320	The, I like the new things that they're doing now with the Dreamscapes,
2639320	2642200	which they kind of touched on a little bit in the trailers,
2642200	2646680	and the intro where you see some really trippy stuff that goes along with the songs.
2646680	2648840	I mean, that's really cool and different.
2648840	2653160	And, you know, the three-point harmonies are pretty cool in there,
2653160	2654840	and how you don't really have to...
2655480	2659080	Those stages for Here Comes the Sun and Octopus Gardens, those Dreamscapes,
2659080	2660600	that was amazing.
2660600	2661160	Amazing.
2661960	2662460	Yeah.
2663080	2665080	The three-part harmonies are pretty cool.
2665080	2667160	How you can, you know, pick which one you want to do.
2667160	2671160	And just like the little stuff that they've added,
2671160	2676520	little tweaks to make the game flow better and play better and is more fun.
2676520	2681000	And that kind of stuff, you know, focusing on the gameplay was really cool.
2681000	2683240	And they're even a supporter with download content.
2683240	2685960	Obviously, you're not gonna be able to take Beatles Rock Band
2685960	2689080	and be able to download the songs to Rock Band 2 or anything like that.
2689080	2692040	It makes sense because, one, it's a different...
2692040	2695080	You know, they had an exclusive deal with, you know,
2695080	2698840	Apple Core and you can't really do that.
2698840	2701560	And, two, this game also supports the three-part harmonies,
2701560	2703960	which is currently not in Rock Band,
2703960	2706600	so you wouldn't be able to really translate that stuff over.
2706600	2709080	Now, also, I could see that being in maybe Rock Band 3,
2709080	2710840	you know, whenever that decides to come out.
2711480	2714120	So maybe that'll be something we'll get in the next game.
2714120	2715560	But they are working on different things.
2715560	2719000	Thank you, Harmonix, though, for not putting out a Rock Band 3 this year.
2719000	2719960	Can I just say that?
2719960	2721960	Thank you for not showing Rock Band 3.
2721960	2725320	However, at the same time, you did show Rock Band Lego thing,
2725320	2726920	which is kind of, like, that's...
2726920	2728200	I guess, in a way, that's cheating.
2728200	2730920	It's more for, like, the pop stuff,
2730920	2733560	like, for the family, you know, type songs,
2734200	2735800	more pop kind of stuff.
2735800	2737080	And that was kind of neat looking.
2738120	2741080	But they are doing the same thing on the Activision side with Band Hero.
2741080	2743320	They just didn't really show much of it.
2744440	2745800	Sephiroth1215 says,
2745800	2747800	Okay, so I say the Beatles can suck it.
2747800	2749160	Why should I buy this game?
2749160	2749800	Which is fair.
2749800	2752200	Not everybody respects the classic music stuff,
2752200	2754600	or, you know, music might not be for everybody.
2754600	2755400	But I'll tell you what.
2756600	2757160	Here's the thing.
2757160	2757720	And somebody...
2757720	2759080	I don't know if I overheard this at the booth,
2759080	2759800	or somebody told me this,
2759800	2760920	and I apologize if it was you,
2760920	2762200	and I'm not giving you credit.
2762200	2763320	But somebody said,
2763320	2764360	You know what?
2764360	2764920	No matter...
2766680	2769000	No matter what kind of music you listen to,
2769000	2771480	you hear these songs in the Beatles games.
2771480	2774920	You can't help but hum along or recognize these songs.
2774920	2777160	How often do you play Rock Band or Rock Band 2,
2777160	2777800	and like, you're like,
2777800	2779000	I've never heard that song before.
2779000	2780360	And I can't do that song.
2780360	2781400	But like with the Beatles songs,
2781400	2782840	there's an awful lot of them.
2782840	2783960	You just know.
2783960	2786120	Because they are so embedded in our culture.
2786120	2788680	You know a lot of these songs.
2788680	2790120	I think that's a big part of it.
2790120	2791160	Plus, for me,
2792120	2793640	the Rock Band Beatles,
2793640	2795960	that's the way to do an artist's game.
2795960	2798040	It makes the Guitar Hero,
2798040	2799160	Aerosmith games,
2799160	2800600	and Van Halen games,
2800600	2803720	and Metallica games look like cheap reskins.
2803720	2804440	Can you imagine,
2804440	2806280	like, if they did like a Pink Floyd,
2806280	2808600	or something really trippy and stuff,
2808600	2810440	with like a Rock Band type thing.
2810440	2812440	The same different stylized stuff,
2812440	2814360	or like a Gorillaz game,
2814360	2815400	or something like that.
2815400	2816440	Same, you know,
2816440	2818760	stylized way.
2818760	2821240	Just they should change it up with each artist if they do it.
2821240	2822520	And then they would be really cool.
2824360	2826280	You know, I just think this is the way to do it.
2826280	2827560	And by the way,
2827560	2830200	if you don't understand what I meant earlier
2830200	2832760	about how DDR needs to kind of, you know,
2832760	2834440	innovate itself and change,
2834440	2836280	this is a perfect example.
2836280	2837000	You know what I mean?
2837000	2839720	Like, when my expectations going into this,
2839720	2841480	because of all the other music games I've seen lately,
2841480	2842360	were very low,
2842360	2843720	going in to look at the Beatles Rock Band,
2843720	2845160	and just kind of seeing that they've really made it
2845160	2846920	like a Beatles experience.
2847480	2849000	I was like, wow,
2849000	2851240	they know how to do it.
2851240	2852120	And honestly,
2852120	2854360	I think other companies could be really learning a lot from this,
2854360	2855560	and hopefully they are.
2855560	2856060	I don't know.
2857240	2858120	So I just, you know,
2858920	2859400	it just,
2859400	2861480	it felt like,
2861480	2863480	it's so hard for me to put into words.
2863480	2865560	It's something you have to see for yourself, I guess.
2865560	2867240	But it feels,
2867240	2869080	it doesn't feel like a cheap reskinning
2869080	2870280	or a cash-in type game.
2870280	2873560	It feels like a Beatles tribute.
2874840	2875340	It's great.
2877960	2879720	Yeah, so we watched some people play that,
2879720	2880840	and it was cool,
2880840	2881480	and, you know.
2882280	2883160	Lego Rock Band,
2883160	2884840	since that got brought up a minute ago.
2884840	2886600	I'm not as excited about that.
2886600	2889400	Now that does look like a cheap reskinning of an old game.
2889400	2890360	I gotta be honest.
2890360	2890760	Yeah.
2890760	2892920	Yeah, it's gonna have the pop songs and all that stuff,
2892920	2895320	which I suppose is gonna make or break the deal,
2895320	2897240	and it's, you know, for the kids or what have you.
2897240	2899400	But I was a little,
2899400	2901480	I literally was looking at Lego Rock Band going,
2901480	2903720	this just looks like Rock Band 2 with Lego people.
2903720	2905160	They didn't really show off a lot of stuff
2905160	2906040	that they were talking about though.
2906040	2907240	Remember with Lego Rock Band,
2907240	2908200	they said they're gonna have like,
2908200	2909800	kind of an adventure mode type stuff,
2909800	2910760	where you, you know,
2910760	2912920	battle monsters and whatnot while,
2912920	2914280	you know, playing music,
2914280	2915400	that kind of stuff.
2915400	2917320	So that might be something kind of neat,
2917320	2918840	and the soundtrack really kind of
2920680	2922440	would make or break this game, I think.
2923000	2924280	But right now,
2924280	2925800	no, it's hard to say.
2925800	2926520	It just looks neat,
2927160	2929480	because you can rock out into a Lego pirate ship
2929480	2930200	and that kind of stuff.
2930760	2932280	I mean, that's just kind of neat.
2932280	2933160	I'd do that anyway.
2933160	2934280	And in the end, you know,
2934280	2936360	it really, you don't have to buy this game.
2936360	2938120	I mean, it's just optional.
2938120	2940840	If it's something that you think would be cool,
2940840	2942280	cool, pick it up,
2942280	2943640	and you know,
2945080	2946120	it's only, I mean,
2946120	2947720	I don't think it's being sold in the bundles, so.
2949400	2950920	Two things Bobby wants me to point out.
2950920	2951880	A, on the Beatles game,
2951880	2954760	a, you do not fill in with the drums anymore.
2954760	2957480	You just hit a green note that's optional.
2957480	2958840	It won't break your combo,
2958840	2959880	and it will,
2959880	2962040	some of the green notes turn into your activation thing,
2962040	2963320	and then if you hit it, it does that.
2963320	2964600	Because, and this makes sense,
2964600	2966360	the Beatles songs did not have fill-ins,
2966360	2968840	and they don't want to change up the music or what have you.
2968840	2970120	So, makes sense.
2970120	2971800	They made a pretty big altercation there
2971800	2972840	in the drum parts with that.
2973480	2974120	Alteration?
2974680	2975080	I guess.
2976040	2979960	Black Wolf in chat also kind of sent me this
2979960	2981160	as kind of like a food for thought,
2981160	2984440	and I actually think it's a really interesting theory.
2984440	2985560	I want to read this.
2985560	2987960	The conspiracy behind Lego Rock Band.
2987960	2990840	Think about which music company's CEO felt
2990840	2992360	that they aren't getting enough money
2992360	2994440	from licensing for music games.
2994440	2997160	Now think about which company is publishing Lego Rock Band.
2997720	3000680	Now realize that download content for Lego Rock Band
3000680	3003000	is not compatible with Rock Band 2.
3003000	3003880	Connect the dots.
3007240	3009800	That's an amazing thought, actually,
3009800	3012840	and something I think a lot of people are overlooking.
3012840	3014520	That probably has a lot to do with it.
3014520	3015640	Absolutely.
3015640	3015960	Probably.
3015960	3017320	Because, right, isn't Warner putting out the...
3017320	3018040	Yes, it is.
3018040	3020920	And which record label was having a big stink?
3020920	3021320	Uh-huh.
3022760	3024280	I think you've stumbled onto something, Bobby.
3024280	3024680	Good job.
3024680	3025640	Gold star.
3025640	3027080	He is Scooby Snack.
3027080	3027580	All right.
3028920	3032520	We share the radio night with you here on All Games
3032520	3033480	for a reason, Bobby.
3033480	3036360	I didn't see the DJ game for the DS there,
3036360	3040200	and I also didn't see that other Army member in DJ game.
3040760	3041560	No, which is a bummer.
3041560	3042760	I was looking forward to seeing that, too.
3043800	3045400	No DJ Max stuff, either.
3045400	3047240	I know we have some fans of DJ Max.
3047240	3049560	I didn't see an appearance from that company, either.
3049560	3049800	No.
3049800	3051720	So nothing there at the show, anyway.
3051720	3052840	Well, they're kind of small.
3052840	3055000	I mean, in the grand scheme of things.
3055000	3055500	Yeah.
3056200	3058120	And those folks that were thinking that,
3058120	3060760	oh, Kensha Hall is lost and gone and what have you,
3061320	3063480	you could still feel their presence there a little bit.
3063480	3067640	But in the space that would have been taken up by Blizzard
3067640	3069720	and some of these other companies that didn't come to E3
3069720	3071800	this year, they did have some of the old Kensha Hall,
3071800	3072680	like DDR game.
3074520	3076600	They're always there at E3 showing off their hard pads
3076600	3077000	and stuff.
3077000	3078600	They were there doing their thing.
3078600	3081400	So they still have some of the old Kensha Hall companies
3081400	3083160	are making a showing in the Indiecade,
3083160	3084280	which was kind of cool.
3085000	3086120	So all right.
3086760	3087480	What do we want to do?
3087480	3092440	Let's talk about some of the press conferences.
3092440	3092920	Why not?
3092920	3095960	I know you guys probably have heard all that you wanted
3095960	3097000	to hear on the press conferences.
3097000	3098280	I just want to recap.
3098280	3100680	Give you guys a chance to give your input on the press
3100680	3101720	conferences what you thought.
3101720	3103960	I was following Twitter during a lot of this too.
3103960	3104600	Were you?
3104600	3105880	Because I was at work.
3106520	3109640	And of course, I can't get on to watch any of the stuff.
3109640	3111080	But I was getting feedback through Twitter.
3111080	3112200	And there's some very interesting things.
3112200	3112840	I stayed home.
3113960	3116200	You know what pissed me off on the Twitter thing?
3116200	3119720	People that declared Microsoft one before Sony was done.
3120360	3120920	Shut up.
3120920	3122120	Shut up.
3122120	3123480	You know that all the good stuff.
3123480	3125000	I mean, fanboy.
3125000	3126360	Hello, fanboy.
3127080	3128520	Sony was not even done yet.
3128520	3131080	Of course, they left their feathers in the cap until the end.
3131080	3132840	Call me a Sony fanboy if you want.
3132840	3134120	But go back in the archives of the show.
3134120	3135080	We've been highly critical.
3135080	3136120	I left it open ended.
3136120	3140200	I'm like, Microsoft has won this unless Sony really brings
3140200	3142920	something to the table that's outstanding.
3142920	3144840	Because if they brought what they brought last year,
3145880	3148120	then I don't know.
3148120	3151560	Nintendo, I'm sorry, we'll get into that.
3151560	3152840	Well, here's the thing.
3152840	3155000	Of the three press conferences, before we go over each one
3155000	3156920	in detail, if you had to pick a winner,
3156920	3158280	if you asked me to pick a winner,
3158280	3159480	you know what I'd tell you?
3159480	3160760	There was no winner.
3160760	3161640	There was no winner.
3162680	3164040	Or everybody was a winner.
3164920	3167000	It really depended on what you were looking
3167000	3168600	for this year in the games.
3168600	3173000	And honestly, I think Microsoft had a lot of great ideas.
3173720	3176680	I think Sony had a lot of great implementations.
3176680	3180280	And I think Nintendo, well, they'll always have soccer moms.
3182680	3185800	Nintendo had a lot of last year.
3185800	3186920	Oh, and then this.
3187800	3191240	That's pretty much what we had from Nintendo.
3192040	3193640	The chat room is speaking up.
3193640	3195320	Bobby Acteft and some other folks saying,
3195320	3196280	the winners are gamers.
3196280	3197000	And that's true.
3197640	3200040	And I was commenting to Loki this as I was walking
3200040	3201400	around the show floor.
3201400	3202360	I was like, you know what?
3202360	3204840	I haven't really played a shitty game yet this year.
3204840	3206600	Usually the E3, there's a lot of games
3206600	3207800	there's a real stinker of a game.
3207800	3209640	I'm kind of like, oh, I don't know about this.
3209640	3210680	I take that back.
3210680	3212200	I did play the Beatles one.
3213320	3216360	Hey, reuniting who Microsoft did on stage.
3216360	3218440	It was an impressive feat for their press conference.
3218440	3220280	So I do give Microsoft props for that.
3220280	3221560	Loki, you did find a shitty game.
3221560	3222920	I did find a shitty game.
3222920	3224520	And I can't remember what it's like.
3225480	3226600	It's a Konami game.
3226600	3227240	Surprise.
3228040	3230760	But it was actually, it was like Zephyr the elemental
3230760	3231880	or something like that.
3231880	3234360	It was supposed to be, it was the one that they had.
3234360	3236040	It's like tornado something or other.
3236040	3237800	It was the working title for it.
3237800	3240680	And it's supposed to be like Katamari where you're this,
3240680	3244440	you know, tornado and you, you know, knock over things
3244440	3246760	and you get bigger as you collect more things.
3246760	3248200	Isn't this game already on Xbox Live marketplace?
3248200	3249800	It should be a vornado game.
3249800	3250760	Yeah, basically.
3250760	3251800	And it sucked.
3251800	3252840	It was boring.
3252840	3254920	So no, I don't like that game.
3254920	3256600	That is my stinker game of E3.
3257240	3259400	I feel the need to say something nice about Konami
3259400	3260760	because we've been giving them a hard time.
3260760	3264520	And to be fair, Konami did show a couple of great things
3264520	3265240	at the show.
3265240	3267240	So before we get into the press conferences, to be fair,
3267240	3267960	I want to say this.
3268920	3271640	The Saw game actually looks interesting.
3272200	3272840	You know what?
3274040	3276920	I can admit when I may not have been right about something
3276920	3280360	before and I don't know if I would necessarily want to buy
3280360	3283240	the Saw game because I think it would be too intense for me.
3283880	3286360	But I think, you know, in observing watching other people
3286360	3288920	play and what they were going for and so forth,
3288920	3291560	I think the Saw game actually looks kind of interesting.
3291560	3293160	The graphics were certainly really good.
3293160	3296200	It kind of has a Silent Hill-ish look to it.
3296200	3297960	But you can definitely see the distinction.
3297960	3300440	It is not about psychological.
3300440	3303960	It's about like in your face, blood and gore.
3303960	3306520	Like, you know, seeing that scene where the guy reaches
3306520	3308200	in the toilet and pulls his hand up and he's got all
3308200	3308920	the needles in it.
3308920	3310200	That's just nasty.
3310200	3311240	Okay, but there's a fan.
3311240	3314200	There's people out there for that that's just nasty.
3314200	3317640	And I got to say, if you're a Fangoria type person,
3317640	3319800	Saw is probably going to appeal to you.
3319800	3321080	It's not terrible.
3321080	3323640	I still would never put any money into it, even if it was
3323640	3325640	the best game in the planet, just so I don't support
3325640	3326280	the franchise.
3327400	3328840	Seriously, that's how I feel.
3328840	3333240	Well, I'm trying to put the personal thoughts on that aside
3333240	3334840	and just evaluate the game itself.
3334840	3339720	And the game is not looking, considering it's a movie tie-in
3339720	3343240	game, it looks like it's raising the bar on those a little bit.
3343240	3345000	I just don't think I can, in good conscience,
3345000	3346360	say anything positive about it.
3347720	3348280	All right.
3348280	3351800	All right, well, I do want to say, though, a game that was
3351800	3354840	incredible at Konami's booth that I played, and not quite
3354840	3356840	my favorite game of the show, but just about my favorite
3356840	3358680	game of the show was Silent Hill Shattered Memories
3358680	3359160	on the Wii.
3359720	3364680	Oh, my gosh, this game was great, especially, and I hate
3364680	3369560	to say this, but for a Wii game, like, it was really...
3369560	3370280	I love it.
3370280	3371560	It runs really smooth.
3371560	3372760	It runs smooth.
3372760	3374440	It looks nice.
3374440	3379480	You know, it doesn't look like a high definition, but it
3379480	3380760	looks pretty good.
3380760	3384680	And, you know, a game doesn't have to necessarily look
3384680	3386200	incredible to be fun.
3387080	3391880	And I love the whole using the flashlight with the Wiimote
3391880	3393160	kind of looking around.
3393160	3395000	I love the way it controlled.
3395000	3398840	It was definitely kind of scary in parts, like when the things
3398840	3400840	would jump out of the darkness on you.
3400840	3403960	I think the game is going to piss off hardcore fans of
3403960	3406120	the Silent Hill because it looks like they've really changed
3406120	3407320	up this first game.
3407320	3408520	But you know what?
3408520	3409800	I'm okay with it.
3409800	3412920	As someone who is casually a Silent Hill fan, I think it's
3412920	3413720	pretty cool.
3413720	3415720	I like some of the changes they've made.
3416680	3417960	It's engrossing.
3417960	3419080	It's scary.
3419080	3423000	It's going to be a lot of fun, and it's a good non-party
3423000	3423880	Wii game.
3423880	3424360	Hooray!
3424920	3428600	This is what I have to say for people who, you know, fuss
3428600	3429640	just because of changes.
3430360	3432680	Without change, we'd have stagnation, and with stagnation,
3432680	3434200	we'd have death.
3434200	3438120	So if you want the franchise to die, then don't look forward
3438120	3439000	to any changes in it.
3439560	3441560	You know, don't, don't, you know, be...
3441560	3443960	But to be honest, I, you know, and I haven't played enough
3443960	3446760	of the first game, but I had a very hard time even seeing
3446760	3448280	the correlations in the first game.
3448280	3449720	I know they must be in there somewhere.
3449720	3450680	Somebody mentioned something.
3450680	3452840	I was reading on the forum somewhere about how dare they
3452840	3456200	make Dahlia look hot and sexy and all this stuff.
3456200	3458520	And you know, I guess they've made some big, big changes
3458520	3459320	to the first game.
3459320	3460760	But she was kind of a hoe.
3460760	3462360	I honestly, whatever.
3462360	3463720	The game was fun.
3463720	3467240	The changes are being made based on how you answer, like,
3467240	3468680	some of this personality stuff.
3468680	3470520	So it kind of changes it.
3470520	3472600	It's almost like, you know, how, like, different things
3472600	3476040	manifest based on, you know, the characters, you know,
3476040	3478360	intentions and, like, desires and that kind of stuff.
3478360	3479640	There's some pretty personal stuff in there.
3479640	3480920	I always remember Silent Hill 2.
3480920	3484600	The little girl never saw any of the, um, any of the monsters
3484600	3487320	or anything, that all the adults had their own special
3487880	3488840	monsters, right?
3488840	3490280	Yeah, it's something like that.
3490280	3492360	The very first thing the game does is it gives you, like,
3492360	3494760	a seven or eight question psychological evaluation.
3494760	3496760	There's some very strange questions in there, like,
3496760	3498520	have you ever cheated on a partner?
3498520	3501000	And it's supposed to be you answering them as you,
3501000	3501960	not as the character.
3502760	3504440	Have you ever role played during sex?
3504440	3506520	And all these, like, very, very personal questions.
3506520	3507560	And of course, as I was taking it,
3507560	3509960	I was trying to make myself sound like the most messed
3509960	3511480	up person on the planet, right?
3512120	3513960	So, um, you know, I'm curious.
3513960	3515640	I didn't really see what impact that's going to have
3515640	3517560	on the game, but it looked interesting.
3517560	3521960	So it is not all boos and jeers at Konami's booth.
3521960	3524920	Silent Hill Shattered Memories was definitely a huge yay.
3524920	3527080	So I did want to get that out there at some point.
3527080	3529480	Okay, now we'll talk about press conferences, shall we?
3529480	3532280	Actually, I should read some comments from chat, actually.
3532280	3536280	Uh, unfolded raptor talking about the saw game.
3536280	3538600	There is one where you have to close stall doors and read
3538600	3541160	the backwards number in the bloodstain mirror in the room
3541160	3543240	and put in the combination for the lock in order to get
3543240	3543880	to the next room.
3543880	3546120	Yeah, that puzzle was in the demo and it's, you know,
3546120	3548280	it was an interesting puzzle.
3548280	3550600	It was, you know, kind of a neat little gameplay mechanic.
3550600	3551320	I thought it was cool.
3552040	3554600	GS68 says, well, they didn't show gore.
3554600	3556440	I think he meant to say, but they showed 3d stuff
3556440	3557880	and some disgusting shit.
3557880	3560440	And that's why I don't think in the end I could actually
3560440	3561400	play the saw game.
3562200	3566280	But, um, you know, the parts I saw that where people
3566280	3570600	weren't losing looked just fine, but I don't think I'd be
3570600	3572200	able to play the game myself.
3572200	3574520	Isn't that weird to kind of say that about a video game?
3574520	3577160	Like, yes, it might be nice for those of you that are into
3577160	3578840	that kind of thing, but, uh, not me.
3580360	3582040	Whatever sinks your battleship.
3582040	3582600	Exactly.
3583480	3583960	I'm sorry.
3583960	3585800	GS68 wasn't talking about the saw game.
3587160	3590120	Oh God, he was talking about Phantom 8, 2009 hentai room.
3590120	3591000	Oh, sorry about that.
3591000	3595160	I was looking up the look in the notes there, but I'm sure
3595160	3597400	the saw game has some pretty disgusting shit in it too.
3597400	3598360	In fact, I know it does.
3598360	3601000	I did see some disgusting real quick before we go on to
3601000	3601880	the conferences.
3601880	3604440	I was going to mention some of the other announcements.
3604440	3605960	From Konami real quick.
3607480	3610040	Of course, some stuff that actually didn't make like the
3610040	3614760	keynotes, um, Kojima Productions announced Metal Gear Solid
3614760	3616120	or Metal Gear Arcade.
3618040	3618600	Okay.
3618600	3619640	Which is kind of neat.
3619640	3623880	And, um, they also, um, you may remember there was that
3623880	3627080	Castlevania type game that they were, you know, previewing
3627080	3628840	that wasn't really Castlevania.
3628840	3631240	Well, it ended up being Castlevania and it's actually being
3631240	3633240	done by Kojima, which is pretty cool.
3633240	3635160	No, I read, I heard about that.
3635160	3636040	That's going to be cool.
3636040	3637880	Patrick Stewart has a voice in it.
3637880	3640040	That makes it like infinitely cool.
3640040	3640520	Yes.
3640520	3643400	So that was definitely a big yay from Konami.
3643400	3644680	So hooray for you guys.
3644680	3645880	He's going to be Dracula.
3645880	3646680	I don't, I don't know.
3646680	3648360	Imagine Patrick Stewart is Dracula.
3648360	3650600	I hope this is a game they're showing up on the floor next
3650600	3651160	year.
3651160	3652520	That would be fantastic.
3652520	3654760	I mean, cause he can do the scary voice.
3654760	3658600	Patrick Warburton as, uh, you know, one of the Belmonts.
3659880	3660600	That'd be funny.
3660600	3665480	Ah, and then of course, and then of course, the kind of go
3665480	3667160	back to music games.
3667160	3669640	Also, Konami announced that they're, they are bringing over
3669640	3672040	that pop music for Wii with no controller.
3672040	3675560	Once again, really, that's not pop music.
3675560	3678200	Like you folks that have been following Konami for 10 years
3678200	3679240	will think it is.
3679240	3681640	So don't, you know what, do yourself a favor.
3681640	3683160	Hardcore Bomani fans.
3683160	3685640	Don't think of this game as pop music because you are just
3685640	3687400	going to be disappointed and don't buy it.
3687400	3690920	Well, I, it's not fair to say that until I've actually had
3690920	3692040	my hands on it playing it.
3692040	3694520	So I'm not going to say that, but I'm going to say, don't
3694520	3696040	think of it as pop music because you're only going to
3696040	3697640	set yourself up for disappointment.
3697640	3698140	Yeah.
3699480	3701560	But Lord, the Shadow looks awesome.
3702840	3704440	That's like a Castlevania game.
3704440	3704840	All right.
3704840	3707320	So let's, uh, let's talk about press conferences here.
3707320	3708280	We're an hour into the show.
3708280	3710040	We haven't even touched on a single press conference yet.
3710040	3712440	So let's, let's talk about the big press conferences so far.
3712440	3713560	Um, where do you want to start?
3713560	3714280	How about Nintendo?
3714280	3715960	I guess we were ragging on Nintendo a little bit.
3715960	3717400	We'll start with them.
3717400	3720200	Uh, some of the things that they mentioned, well, not all
3720200	3721640	the news was bad out of Nintendo.
3721640	3723800	I mean, certainly Metroid, other M, how about this?
3723800	3726520	Team Ninja teams up with Nintendo to put out the
3726520	3727560	next Metroid game.
3727560	3733240	The only good announcement out of, out of their press
3733240	3733720	conference.
3733720	3736920	And seriously, if they hadn't announced this, I would have
3736920	3738280	had no hope for them.
3739880	3742840	Well, this was definitely the thing to cater to the, uh,
3742840	3744120	hardcore gamers.
3744120	3746760	Yes, it's a good example of how to revitalize your
3746760	3747320	franchise.
3747320	3749160	Have someone else do it.
3749160	3751240	But we don't have, um, Itagaki.
3752840	3755240	Yeah, I know that is a little weird because it's Team Ninja
3755240	3757320	without their, their freaking rock star.
3757320	3759880	But you know, the, the trailer looked promising.
3759880	3761640	It definitely looks like a kick in the butt to the
3761640	3764360	franchise, which, you know, I guess even though I, that
3764360	3766520	means this, uh, that just means that Samus won't have,
3766520	3767480	you know, boob mechanics.
3768120	3771880	Prime was all right, but yeah, I was missing my 2D Metroid
3771880	3772920	and this is going to give it to me.
3772920	3775000	Prime did not do it for me.
3775000	3778120	I just couldn't get in the prime and corruptions, you
3778120	3779320	know, look kind of dumb.
3779880	3781800	Um, but this looks awesome.
3781800	3783960	This looks like something that could actually play and
3783960	3784680	would want to play.
3785880	3787800	Let's talk about some of the other things that came out of
3787800	3789400	the Nintendo press conference now.
3789400	3790920	So you said that was the one thing.
3790920	3792920	What about New Super Mario Brothers Wii?
3792920	3795000	The four player game on the Wii.
3795000	3797000	This is the very first game I played on the show floor,
3797000	3797320	by the way.
3797320	3801400	It's the four player, uh, like basically it's New Super
3801400	3802440	Mario Brothers from the DS.
3802440	3804120	They're like, they had like a battle mode or something in
3804120	3804760	it, I think.
3804760	3807480	Now it's on the Wii and four people at once can play.
3807480	3808840	It's, it's stupid.
3808840	3810360	You know why it's stupid?
3810360	3812520	It's because it's just porting basically the game from the
3812520	3813160	DS.
3813160	3816520	And yeah, I know it's a new, new game and stuff, but really
3816520	3820280	for, unless, you know, you're really in the party games and
3820280	3822600	really into playing this with like, you know, four people
3822600	3826280	at once, which that's fine because, you know, the Wii is
3826280	3828440	for a lot of people that want to do party games and stuff
3828440	3828840	like that.
3828840	3831320	But I just couldn't see myself breaking this out at a party
3831320	3832280	and playing this game.
3832280	3834920	It'd be like, you know, the regular New Super Mario
3834920	3835320	Brothers.
3835320	3838760	I played through it myself and that's it.
3838760	3841160	This game, if I play through it myself, I'm not going to
3841160	3842680	really get anything out of it.
3842680	3843640	And that's the problem.
3844680	3846760	Yeah, I played this on the show floor, like I said, and it
3846760	3847640	was fun.
3847640	3850200	It was, it was, you know, it's neat for people.
3850200	3852600	It was a lot of fun and very competitive, but don't be
3852600	3853640	mistaken, folks.
3853640	3858280	This is another party game on the Wii in Mario's clothing.
3858280	3860680	And don't call this New Super Mario Brothers because you
3860680	3861880	just part of this shit.
3861880	3863240	It's not new.
3863240	3864280	It's ported.
3864280	3865240	Slightly recycled.
3866840	3868200	It doesn't have the same ring to it.
3868200	3869960	It's just like, oh, come on.
3871000	3871800	Well, here's the thing.
3871800	3872440	And you know what?
3872440	3872840	You're right.
3872840	3875640	Because I asked, I'm like, so what's, I even asked the
3875640	3878760	well-educated woman that was running the little demo.
3878760	3881720	I said, so if I'm just kind of like one guy playing this, you
3881720	3883240	know, is there going to be stuff in this for me?
3883240	3885720	And she said, well, yeah, there is like a single player mode,
3885720	3888280	but it's not really, you know, that's not really the focus.
3888280	3889080	Oh, awesome.
3889080	3890200	That's not really the focus.
3890200	3891560	That's very nice.
3891560	3891960	I didn't.
3891960	3892360	Here's the thing.
3892360	3894360	And I didn't really get, to be fair, that wasn't really the
3894360	3896600	focus of the demo they were showing or not really the focus
3896600	3897320	of the game.
3897320	3899560	My opinion of what she said was that's not really the focus
3899560	3902200	of the game because if there was like a single player mode,
3902200	3904520	they would have shown it somewhere, but that's not what
3904520	3905000	they were showing.
3905000	3907240	They were showing this four player party thing.
3907240	3910200	And strangely enough, it's not online.
3910840	3912680	They had the perfect opportunity to have a fun little
3912680	3913240	online game.
3913240	3916760	Yeah, I love it because as, as Bobby was saying in his show,
3917320	3920600	because the processing power of the we can't handle online,
3920600	3927400	with this type of game it can't handle online with this type of game what
3927400	3933520	didn't brawl do that or whatever what what what the hell was this one they
3933520	3939080	just had on the game to be Smash Brothers yes we yeah they had that was
3939080	3943600	online it was like you sometimes they did it that this other game have much
3943600	3950920	better than brawl yeah it they can't handle online then you need better
3950920	3957840	programmers I'm sorry but it's a 2d game okay it's a 2d game with very low polys
3957840	3964720	and you can't handle four people online Mario Kart can handle four people online
3964720	3969360	and that's my cards fun and that's way more complex than this game why can't
3969360	3972280	you handle four people online oh I know why because you don't want to embrace
3972280	3975960	online that's really the reason behind it it's not because it's a technical
3975960	3979320	limitation because if it was a technical limitation I'm sure you'd find a way
3979320	3985040	around it it's a personal limitation it's because uh this the person that's
3985040	3988600	gonna buy this game isn't probably really into online they're probably into
3988600	3994360	soccer and they probably are a mom that
3994360	3999520	half a canana Graham and chat says Rob they said that is the game with extra
3999520	4003440	players joining in and leaving at any time so yeah that is the game that's
4003440	4007280	exactly what I'm saying don't be fooled this is a party game at least smash
4007280	4011840	brothers brawl had a single-player mode that was pretty extensive and fun all I'm
4011840	4015440	saying is that if there is you know to be fair to Nintendo if there is a
4015440	4019520	single-player fun bonanza in here I just have yet to see it so if you are
4019520	4023520	thinking you're excited about this game that's cool I hope you have friends to
4023520	4027040	play it with regularly this is when I saw this when they're like oh we have
4027040	4031320	new Super Mario Brothers now on the Wii come in this holiday I was like whoop
4031320	4036840	these shit there's also people though that I just hope you have friends it's
4036840	4040360	like you know oh we've been waiting for a Mario but another Mario Brothers game
4040360	4047080	on the Wii new Super Mario Brothers awesome no I'm sorry that wasn't awesome
4047080	4049840	Tiger Claw and chat says yeah Nintendo is forgetting that there are many of us
4049840	4052640	who don't know people in the neighborhood that own the same system so
4052640	4056160	yeah you're pretty much all alone what are you talking about everybody in the
4056160	4060640	plant does not own a Wii or I don't know doesn't want to buy this game or it
4060640	4063000	doesn't want to come over to your house all right look we got a lot of ground to
4063000	4068160	cover Mario and Luigi Bowser's Inside Story a new DS Mario and Luigi game I
4068160	4072200	I played the first few of the games in this series it is a cute role-playing
4072200	4079320	series you know it has its fans okay whatever Super Mario Galaxy 2 okay now
4079320	4084720	with Yoshi Mario Galaxy 1 was fun huh Loki where's the love it looked okay but
4084720	4090320	honestly looking at Super Mario Galaxy 1 & 2 I couldn't tell you the difference
4090320	4095440	and I bet you anything if you comprise of a trailer between 1 & 2 and you you
4095440	4099040	know kind of clip them together I bet you no one could tell you what games or
4099040	4104320	what levels for were from which games because they look that similar Oh Yoshi's
4104320	4110280	in it now oh my mistake Yoshi's in this well obviously it's a sequel now but I
4110280	4115680	mean really it they didn't do that much to it I mean whereas you know like Super
4115680	4120400	Mario World you know Super Mario World 1 & 2 I mean those are very different
4120400	4124360	games yeah they were really different games I mean granted world 2 was kind of
4124360	4131400	annoying but um hey world 2 was awesome I was really a baby I mean oh just mute
4131400	4135760	the damn TV if it gets to you or don't suck so much and keep losing the baby
4135760	4141680	then you won't hear it cry but that's that's that's what Mario Galaxy 2 needs
4141680	4147520	a crying baby on the back of Yoshi touch fuzzy get dizzy but that's the thing
4147520	4150880	though it's like I mean I understand that they're working on a Mario game but
4150880	4155080	it's like they're almost like oh my god fans keep berating us for new Mario game
4155080	4159000	what are we gonna do let's just take the old engine to add some new levels to it
4159000	4165040	you know whereas if the Nintendo Wii had actually been you know designed so that
4165040	4169960	you can accept download content we wouldn't have Mario you know galaxy 2 we
4169960	4174880	would have download content for Mario Galaxy and there would be your levels
4174880	4179760	all right inner logic and chat says okay there's a lot of yelling going on how
4179760	4183000	about switching to a subject that can let everyone relax how about we use our
4183000	4189160	inside maybe 3do talk okay well just for you inner logic let me ask Loki about
4189160	4192680	this little gem here one big thing that the Nintendo had to unveil at their
4192680	4201000	press conference the Wii vitality sensor I laughed so hard what he's just sitting
4201000	4205720	up there talking about the next big innovation it's like oh what are you
4205720	4208720	gonna show us what are you gonna show us I know it's gonna be lame but what are
4208720	4215600	you gonna show us and then boom the vitality sensor I'm like what the hell
4215600	4222200	is this and like everybody I think was like what Thank You Nintendo for giving
4222200	4225160	us shit we don't need like they're all it's gonna take the gaming to the next
4225160	4232160	level for geriatrics maybe no seriously a heart monitor for we fit it dude I can
4232160	4235000	give myself an electrocardiogram on those seriously they're like you know
4235000	4239480	it's gonna it's gonna allow you you know that this detects more stuff than just
4239480	4242160	the heart rate you know and I'll be relaxed great you'll tell me I'm
4242160	4246280	unhealthy in new ways that I didn't think possible that's really gonna help
4246280	4250040	me relax what does your we do now let's see brain aid brain age tells you you're
4250040	4254320	dumb we fit tells you you're fat I mean now this thing's just gonna tell you
4254320	4259600	your heart's bad to our games to screw with the Americans I'm sorry you're all
4259600	4262760	they're gonna do is come out with another game that's gonna have some mini
4262760	4267440	games based on this accessory and then that's it imagine though Wario where
4267440	4279680	with the weave I tell it some of the mini games stop beating I'm sorry it's
4279680	4283920	gonna be dumb and no it also makes it dumb is they should have done this like
4283920	4289000	Bluetooth or something like that so that you can utilize it with like the we
4289000	4293280	nunchuck and stuff like that oh no it just goes in the you know expansion slot
4293280	4298080	for the Wii remote so you can't plug in a nunchuck anymore you just have the Wii
4298080	4302720	Vitality sensor and I would like to bet you money there's a goddamn Wario where
4302720	4307960	game that uses this stupid sensor somehow I bet you any and how long how
4307960	4312040	long may I ask before we hear about an injury where someone has inserted their
4312040	4317560	penis into the vitality sensor because I bet you anything someone will do that
4317560	4323600	because if it's got some sort of way to attach to something someone's gonna
4323600	4327960	strike try to stick their penis in there and that's what's gonna happen
4327960	4331760	that's immediately when I thought what I saw I'm like how long is it gonna take
4331760	4337920	before someone sticks their penis in that I know that's gonna happen I think
4337920	4343560	you just made Rob hurt I hurt you know what I didn't even think about this he's
4343560	4348640	right guys okay chat room who's gasping and saying WTF and so on he's fucking
4348640	4353280	right you know it he's fucking right how long before someone sticks their dick in
4353280	4357440	it I mean that's just the question about all of humanity and any object that God
4357440	4361880	can put in front of us how long before someone puts their dick in it
4361880	4369920	oh grandma me grandma me cello did how long before someone puts their dick in
4369920	4375880	it exactly it's mashed potatoes see now all we need is to talk about farting and
4375880	4380080	we'll be cool and then and then I'd like to finish off the rest of their their
4380080	4383840	wonderful conference they talked about Wii Sports Resort and they added talked
4383840	4388560	about the new games there which are fine you know they're they're neat you know
4388560	4391760	but you know you have to have the Wii motion plus so guess what if you want
4391760	4396800	your friends over you guys spend another $80 to buy four more you know or I guess
4396800	4401360	another 60 on top of the game to buy you know three more Wii motion pluses and
4401360	4406360	then on top of all that then they have we was it we fit plus which may
4406360	4410760	insinuate that it's using Wii motion plus but oh no that would be a wrong
4410760	4414840	assumption because really it's just the old game brought back with ten new
4414840	4420040	exercises and like some online you know data sharing or something like that
4420040	4423720	whoop-dee-doo but guess what they're gonna have new bundles and people are
4423720	4427120	gonna be dumb and not realize that it's actually the same game they just bought
4427120	4433120	and they're gonna buy it all over again frisbee says now that's what I call
4433120	4441560	touch generation games although res with the Wii vitality sensor might be kind of
4441560	4446160	fun all right other things out of Nintendo's press conference Wii Sports
4446160	4449840	Resort I actually played this game on the floor it was some I played the
4449840	4455280	archery game which was you know what can I say about Wii Sports it's the type of
4455280	4459400	thing that's fun at a party when I have friends over hey let's play Wii Sports
4459400	4462560	let's have a little competition you know because you know we're at a party and
4462560	4466800	drinking so we can't go outside and play so let's do some Wii Sports but I don't
4466800	4469840	think I would ever play this by myself like hey I'm bored I want to shoot
4469840	4476480	archery did you ever figure out what exactly we motion plus does I mean it
4476480	4481120	looks like it just allows motion detection in more places I mean to be
4481120	4484560	honest the archery thing did feel natural and I think with the controller
4484560	4488440	they have today it would have been a little bit because we remember it's
4488440	4496520	shaking way back we did play archery in deca support yeah how I don't know if
4496520	4500600	you remember that that much not really but I do I seem to recall there was more
4500600	4504240	I don't know it just seemed more precision I don't know I don't know how
4504240	4508400	to explain it I don't know don't get me wrong I don't think this Wii motion plus
4508400	4512720	is anything that special I didn't but keep in mind this is the only thing I
4512720	4517040	got to see I stood in a fairly long line just to play this and then I got kicked
4517040	4520920	out for some filming of something thank you very much Nintendo at least I got a
4520920	4525600	frisbee you know but whatever and it's that's part of the give-and-take of e3
4525600	4528640	you know so I can't base my entire judgment of this game off of what I
4528640	4534800	played however you know again I didn't see anything that made me go oh you know
4534800	4540720	I need this game Red Seal 2 though looked awesome with how so I didn't
4540720	4544960	really check that out it ran really smooth 60 frames per second the Wii
4544960	4550720	motion plus and sword tracking really worked and it looked fun unlike Red Seal
4550720	4557800	1 which sucked other games shown in Nintendo's press conference Wii Fit Plus
4557800	4561120	which I also actually played on the show floor and you know you know I've
4561120	4563840	actually been somewhat of an advocate of Wii Fit despite all the crap we give
4563840	4569720	Nintendo I do think Wii Fit is a good thing Wii Fit Plus more for people who
4569720	4573120	don't already own it I can't see my I mean it really depends on the price
4573120	4575960	point I didn't see how much they were gonna charge for this game I can't see
4575960	4580880	myself paying a lot of money for it if it's not going to give me anything that
4580880	4584440	special if that makes sense what if it is more mini games what if they make we
4584440	4590080	lipo I'd probably buy it are we gastric bypass I could use that no I don't I
4590080	4593320	wouldn't want that too many risks with that but the game the game I played on
4593320	4596680	the floor was a bicycling game where you use the Wii mode it's like the
4596680	4602040	handlebars on a bike and you kind of March in place to pedal your bike it was
4602040	4605640	it was a good workout and it was it was a cute mini game so that I mean there
4605640	4608720	was like a marching band mini game it looks like some of their new mini games
4608720	4613280	are pretty inventive but is it going to be worth 40 bucks for just these few new
4613280	4617520	mini games I don't know depends how much how good that online functionality is
4617520	4624000	but based on what I saw I don't really see anything that justifies 40 bucks 20
4624000	4627280	bucks maybe but I highly doubt that's what they're charging for it it's not
4627280	4633680	going to be 20 bucks exactly so um let's see what other kind of stuff was
4633680	4636880	announced in a press conference that's pretty much all that I have on my list I
4636880	4640960	don't know if there was others of your eyes announced hmm that didn't quite
4640960	4647400	make their press conference new colors that's right it was about time now Japan
4647400	4652360	during the summer we'll be getting a black we that's right black wheeze
4652360	4657960	coming on August 1st and we'll be coming with you know colored accessories as
4657960	4663400	well including the black we mote classic controller and classic controller Pro
4663400	4666680	which they actually did have that in a little like case over there kept walking
4666680	4672400	by and go what the hell is that but don't really care and also we'll be
4672400	4678160	getting a D red DSI system as well launching July 11th I wouldn't be
4678160	4680840	surprised if we see this around Christmas cuz that would be about the
4680840	4686840	time to put out something I want to buy the system but it wasn't black oh now I
4686840	4692920	get to buy it you know really I don't think so but okay then they also had
4692920	4699220	some other games that they were showing off that I didn't really I really know
4699220	4704720	what they were but they owe other announcements obviously DSI was getting
4704720	4711160	a Facebook support as well they're gonna allow you to upload pictures you take
4711160	4715040	with the DSI camera with face to Facebook as if there wasn't enough crap
4715040	4719360	on my feed I hope I can block it like you can all the other stuff actually I
4719360	4722760	don't know what the DSI depending on who it is it might be kind of funny well
4722760	4725900	that's cool and all but I guess okay because I guess like it's not like
4725900	4729040	screenshots from DS games it's the actual camera in your DSI right yes
4729040	4733480	that's no different from mobile uploads so whatever that's cool I guess that's
4733480	4737320	neat and all but what I wish they'd have something for the Wii like you know some
4737320	4741520	of this functionality for the Wii but I guess you know they've given up on that
4741520	4745840	and then of course announcing that they you're gonna localize some of the other
4745840	4750760	stuff that released in Japan already including Warioware DIY you know which
4750760	4755720	is the Warioware you know kind of create your own minigames type thing they've
4755720	4761000	also announced Flipnote Studios for DSI this summer which is also you know like
4761000	4766480	the motion notepad that they have in Japan right now and new Mario and Luigi
4766480	4771560	RP well was it March of the minis again they're gonna do another Mario vs.
4771560	4775080	Donkey Kong game I think that was gonna be a DSI only app or something like that
4775080	4778480	oh that was the one that came out and it's out tomorrow or something like
4778480	4783280	didn't they announce that something like it's out now it was a download game I
4783280	4786000	don't have a DSI can I say this though real quick is the chat room really wants
4786000	4789120	us to mention Golden Sun I've saw a couple other people mentioning that
4789120	4793160	before an SSJ 100 Matt kind of sums it up here I got excited for a split second
4793160	4796240	when they said at their press conference an old franchise that was once gone is
4796240	4801520	coming back I thought maybe mother three kid Icarus yeah I know but I saw that
4801520	4805200	too I that was funny like oh yeah they're gonna announce mother three oh
4805200	4811960	nope they're not all right anything else you want to say about Nintendo's press
4811960	4820000	conference it still sucked now the Rob D wants to point out I'm really excited I
4820000	4823320	loved Golden Sun this is a good thing a very good thing yeah I mean the Golden
4823320	4827240	Sun games are fun but you have to admit there's some folks that are gonna feel
4827240	4830320	that huge sense of disappointment like oh my god I've been waiting forever for
4830320	4836280	kid Icarus here it is Oh Golden Sun fuck you you know there are there were a lot
4836280	4840480	of people that had that moment but I'm glad at least some people got a thrill
4840480	4843240	out of the whole golden this announcement yeah I mean in the end it's
4843240	4846880	not like it's a bad announcement it just I think they set the bar a little high
4846880	4853360	with that announcement anyhow let's see I think what I think we're gonna go
4853360	4856000	ahead and take a break we're almost about an hour and a half into the show
4856000	4860360	but before we get to the break of course we always like to close out part a with
4860360	4865080	a moment where we can kind of respect the classics so that's exactly what
4865080	4868120	we're gonna do tonight we're gonna do a little segment we always do here called
4868120	4874840	the classic game of the week so dark soccer amongst all these newfangled
4874840	4878680	games we're talking about is the three what's an old classic that folks should
4878680	4883880	be revisiting I went for old and obscure it's actually a game I've mentioned on
4883880	4889840	the show before which is to date one of my favorite shoot-em-up games is called
4889840	4899880	Genga Fukete Densetsu Sapphire which is on the duo oops I cut it off
4899880	4904400	accidentally sorry here we go again here's a little clip of the game
4908760	4916000	our arcade CD-ROM games that came out so that means of course with my turbo duo I
4916000	4923800	can't play it which I do own a copy of the game but it's also one of the few
4923800	4929560	games towards the end of the PC engines life that had an actual real 3d in it in
4929560	4935640	the form of the bosses and some of the enemies in the game but it actually came
4935640	4939160	out recently on PSP as part of the galaxy Fraulein collection which is
4939160	4943360	actually something I plan on ordering very soon because again this is one of
4943360	4949160	my favorite games and if you want to find it on eBay good luck it's gonna
4949160	4954320	this game will out will actually ends up costing more than Dracula X does is one
4954320	4960680	will go for easily 400 bucks I've seen it but anyway it's basically just a
4960680	4964520	standard you know shoot them up you can get your upgrade your weapons and you
4964520	4967960	have your little option things hanging out with you and you just basically go
4967960	4972000	to the game and shoot stuff now I type the name of the game in chat but they
4972000	4974440	would like to hear it pronounced once again because it is not an easy name
4974440	4978960	because it is a Japanese game oh it's ginga fukay
4978960	4986040	Densetsu sapphire there you go if you want a translation of the name that is
4986040	4991800	galaxy police woman legend sapphire it came out in 1995 it is a Hudson soft
4991800	4999080	game one of the oh god I love Hudson but but also one of the things about the
4999080	5002160	game this is actually something that I've actually seen in several reviews
5002160	5009120	I'm gonna repeat this one from one little review this says that really the
5009120	5014760	game is more of overcoming the game's mechanics rather than mastering them so
5014760	5019400	really a lot of playing in the game is hit or miss whether or not you make it
5019400	5024840	through it the game has it out for you it's gonna have that where you have
5024840	5030440	actual oh that's kind of neat like this boss looks like imagine one of those
5030440	5034440	giant chemistry molecules they have hanging from cotton chemistry class like
5034440	5037000	it's like one of those things but it's actually like rotating around and
5037000	5041360	spinning around so for you know a game from 95 that's a pretty cool depth yeah
5041360	5049720	it was it really is though even though it's really a little bit on the the hard
5049720	5054240	side your bosses are so easy in this one because they are so predictable in their
5054240	5061680	patterns and the whole the whole part though is you know trying to get around
5061680	5068680	how slow your ship really is because the ship is you'll see the ship does move
5068680	5076680	really slowly and you have a relatively large hitbox you know the area that will
5076680	5083160	count as you being hit so but other than that game really doesn't look easy it
5083160	5086160	does look very hard have you actually had a chance to play this star soccer
5086160	5092640	yeah my friend actually she lives in Japan right now she has an original of
5092640	5101000	this which is how I got my copy of it but she well she's got a PC engine duo
5101000	5105720	and arcade card so we went over to her house and just she said okay play this
5105720	5110340	game okay play this game okay play this game and sapphire was just like oh my
5110340	5115680	god it was like this one and another shooter a psychic storm were the ones
5115680	5118260	that I played the most but mostly because in psychic storm it sounds like
5118260	5121360	they're saying I get pissed off instead of saying psychic storm but that's
5121360	5126900	another game but see isn't that we really should post the link to this in
5126900	5131360	the chat room because it's something that you really have to see it's just a
5131360	5137880	fantastic a fantastic shooter and you know I'm gonna actually do it in eBay
5137880	5142080	search right now and see if I can find out how much going for all right well
5142080	5144680	let me just go ahead and wrap this up and say it's there it is again your
5144680	5147560	classic game of the week and Jamie might have to correct me here
5147560	5154240	ginga fuke Densetsu sapphire not bad all right there it is your classic game of
5154240	5159520	the week we are going to take a break and come back with more of orange lounge
5159520	5163800	radio when we come back from a quick break we have not even touched on Sony's
5163800	5166680	press conference and Microsoft's press conference and believe me there's a lot

5200000	5205160	this June the 7th of 2009 as a reminder we do tape live on Sunday nights over at
5205160	5208960	all games calm right after the Bobby Black Wolf show which is about six
5208960	5212440	o'clock Pacific Standard Time nine o'clock Eastern Standard Time unless
5212440	5215920	it's a special night maybe Bobby will go a little longer we'll start more like
5215920	5220280	615 as tonight was because it was Bobby's 200th episode quite an
5220280	5225240	accomplishment so congratulations to Bobby remember when we were only 200 I
5225240	5230000	remember those days but no no I'm to be fair Bobby is very consistent he does a
5230000	5233240	show I mean he only is missed like maybe two or three shows about it throughout
5233240	5238640	his entire run whereas we miss one every few months we try not to but as
5238640	5241960	sometimes you know things happen but Bobby's a very committed individual so
5241960	5245160	props to him it's a very neat accomplishment all right anyhow we're
5245160	5250000	gonna get back and do some e3 rundown again unscripted tonight just kind of
5250000	5255120	talking and playing around talking about some of the various events that have
5255120	5259400	happened at e3 and I guess we're going to talk about Sony's press conference if
5259400	5263320	that's all right before we do that I was gonna mention a few more things about
5263320	5268160	Nintendo the stuff I saw I got to see sin and punishment 2 which looked
5268160	5273640	awesome you know give me a great game for shooter fans also they had a few
5273640	5278840	other games are shown off didn't really announce which looked interesting I'm
5278840	5283240	not sure what they really think of them like they had for example line attack
5283240	5287120	heroes which looked like you have like almost like a marching band worth you
5287120	5290840	know like people just following you and you all had different abilities and you
5290840	5296000	kind of attack in formation which is weird and then this other game like we
5296000	5301000	game called span smashers which I don't even know what that looked like it was
5301000	5304440	kind of weird but they had like some other stuff that they were announcing
5304440	5308800	fossil fighters for the DS which actually I know that's coming out in
5308800	5315200	August and some other you knew a new professor Leighton game and Pokemon
5315200	5321080	mystery dungeon explorers of the sky all sorts of stuff so that was kind of neat
5321080	5328800	and then I think I said in punishment 2 is supposed to be coming out quarter 1
5328800	5333440	of next year so that's kind of cool all right are we okay to move on Sony now
5333440	5337680	sure let's talk Sony Sony definitely had a lot of big news out of their press
5337680	5342800	conference and very interesting story I have about Sony Loki you missed day one
5342800	5345600	of e3 which is when the Sony press conference is going on from what I
5345600	5349160	understand day one of e3 was not originally supposed to start until noon
5349160	5352720	but it ended up starting at 10 a.m. but the interesting effect this had is it
5352720	5356760	caused Sony's press conference to run into the beginning of the show I was not
5356760	5359360	well I was invited to Sony's press conference so I was not able to get
5359360	5363480	there or make my plans in time to get there so I was just like oh well you
5363480	5367680	know I'm sure I'll see everything you know later on which I was of course but
5367680	5371640	one cool thing is that at Sony's booth they were playing the press conference
5371640	5376520	so it was it was one of the few places that I'm sorry one of the first places I
5376520	5379720	went to when I was at e3 was I went to Sony's booth and Nintendo's booth were
5379720	5384360	kind of right next to each other and I wanted to check that out but obviously
5384360	5387120	there's some big announcements as Sony what's also cool a lot of people may not
5387120	5390640	know because they were at Sony's press conference God of War 3 as you know was
5390640	5394720	playable at the show floor in Sony's booth but during the press conference
5394720	5398680	all the monitors were turned off so you actually couldn't play God of War 3
5398680	5402160	until the walkthrough was done but you knew it was going to be there because
5402160	5406480	they had the God of War 3 sign up and they already had a line forming but just
5406480	5409800	nobody could play it until the press conference is actually over but I did
5409800	5412120	get to see some of Sony's press conference at the booth which is kind of
5412120	5415240	cool and to see some of their big announcements of course God of War 3
5415240	5419280	being one of them I'm not huge on the God of War series you know I certainly
5419280	5423280	respect what it is it's just I don't have time to play everything as none of
5423280	5427080	us do and this is just one of the big series I haven't gotten around to Loki I
5427080	5430460	don't know if you're big on these games I like them they're okay it's nothing
5430460	5433680	really innovative for God of War 3 other than you know obviously the nicer
5433680	5437880	graphics now with the PlayStation 3 and it is a little bit more detailed in the
5437880	5443400	gore in fact there is one point where they had slashed open I believe a
5443400	5447680	minotaur and just like his organs are spilling out and you got to see those
5447680	5453320	organs still out so that was kind of cool yeah so I mean yeah it's gonna if
5453320	5457040	you're a fan of God of War you're gonna love this game I mean it's just the same
5457040	5461800	type of gameplay that you can normally expect from them brand new trailer for
5461800	5465880	Final Fantasy 13 shown with English voice acting in the trailers that's nice
5465880	5469060	to know what's actually going on for once yeah it's nice to kind of understand
5469060	5473320	it and it looks looks very nice the voices look very synced up with the lips
5473320	5478360	I don't think that they have redone the voice there yeah you know how usually in
5478360	5483120	the dubbing it's very obvious it's dubbed but they they look in sync this
5483120	5488320	time which is kind of nice I don't know we'll see for now they do we'll see so
5488320	5492400	cuz you know how usually they dub over the Japanese lips do you remember when
5492400	5497760	10-2 came out they re-synced the animation to the voices to it'll be nice
5497760	5501760	that they do that for 13 but I'm not counting on it and they redid the a lot
5501760	5507880	of the CG to to match voice and they completely redid two whole scenes in
5507880	5513160	that game for the American audience yeah so it makes sense they do something like
5513160	5517280	that with 13 so obviously this games on its way out and they did confirm this
5517280	5521200	for 2010 release and it was nice to see some of it actually getting pulled you
5521200	5524160	know some more of its shown to get know a little more showed Odin which is
5524160	5528880	pretty cool yes and some of the summons which is pretty awesome but then a huge
5528880	5533320	bombshell dropped right after that at the show and what's interesting about it
5533320	5536780	is that then he started talking about how Final Fantasy 14 was exclusive to
5536780	5539840	the PlayStation 3 before even showing the trailer talked about I'm here to
5539840	5543120	announce a Final Fantasy 14 is going to be exclusive on the PlayStation 3 and
5543120	5547940	everybody's thinking oh oh you meant versus oh you meant 13 versus oh you
5547940	5552200	silly man oh you know like everybody thought he messed up and then they show
5552200	5556560	the trailer and sure enough oh my god it is Final Fantasy 14 and not just that
5556560	5563040	it's Final Fantasy 14 online you mean 11 2 yeah so for some people it's 11 2 and
5563040	5567360	you might even think oh my gosh I saw elves in the trailer gaulka Taru it is
5567360	5570640	just 11 2 especially you can kind of tell which parts are probably from the
5570640	5575520	game but if you read a little deeper it's a different world and supposedly
5575520	5580200	the races are similar but different they're actually one up of all places
5580200	5584240	actually had a pretty in-depth talk on Final Fantasy 14 and some of the things
5584240	5587360	they've talked about they have learned a lot of their lessons from the prior game
5587360	5591480	this game is going to be launched globally Final Fantasy 14 it's gonna be
5591480	5595240	on the PlayStation 3 and the PC it's gonna be on both they're also talking
5595240	5599620	about bringing it to the 360 they're thinking about it I suppose but nothing's
5599620	5604840	for sure yet and what yeah I'll probably playing it on the PC no matter what I
5604840	5608680	can't imagine playing it on a console I don't know I really wish they hadn't
5608680	5614680	announced this well because he's watching like sucked away oh no I I
5614680	5619120	seriously wanted to cry standing in the booth watching that trailer and it
5619120	5622600	wasn't because of the trailer itself but it's because I just saw the next few
5622600	5626120	years of my life wilting away at this game because we all know that's what's
5626120	5630560	gonna happen no no no no no no this will happen to me because I have something
5630560	5635800	far better to look forward to Star Trek online right yeah I know that's gonna be
5635800	5639000	tough because I want to play that too but it won't be tough at all for me I
5639000	5643160	do want to talk about 14 online a little more because some other things they said
5643160	5646840	in the interview they are designing this game so whether you have hours to play
5646840	5651560	or 40 minutes to play you will be able to play and that they are gearing or
5651560	5660200	they are tailoring this game to solo and party content yeah thanks God so it's
5660200	5663520	like it sounds like like some of the biggest flaws of Final Fantasy 11 have
5663520	5667560	the potential of being addressed in this this this could be huge but of course I
5667560	5672040	don't want to set the bar too high or I might be disappointed so I'm and of
5672040	5676760	course the chat room wants to know I mean whoa maybe this is good music for
5676760	5681360	that question no I may set sumo wants to know in chat a sky Final Fantasy 14 or
5681360	5687280	Star Trek what a tough question I have to play them both it's too early to say
5687280	5692320	because you know they both might say the question well it is because they I'm
5692320	5696640	gonna try them both how's that both I want to play them both but I will keep
5696640	5702400	the one that's more fun in the end which probably is gonna be 14 but I don't know
5702400	5706080	nothing's for sure yet nothing's for sure yet because I do explode other
5706080	5710800	ships I do I yeah they honestly lay a Ferengi there how could how could these
5710800	5716600	games be any more different one is about freaking space and one is about swords
5716600	5720560	and weapons they didn't have a ship so they're flying around in each other and
5720560	5723360	something so you're gonna get sucked into this MMO Loki after I don't know
5723360	5726960	here's the best I don't have time if the wife's not gonna let you you have kids
5726960	5734640	to raise now who cares you can get a sitter I'll play I'll let them play to
5734640	5738440	SSJ 100 man chat says why can't we have our cake and pie at the same time
5738440	5742720	exactly haven't you ever heard of getting ice cream and honestly honestly
5742720	5745560	afraid of having these I I don't know if I'll actually play this game because I
5745560	5750640	just want time it's it'll be a time factor but I am very excited about this
5750640	5755200	and honestly I would say that this right here was the biggest surprise of the
5755200	5759140	show no one saw this coming who could imagine that they would have Final
5759140	5764040	Fantasy 14 coming out the same year as 13 hypothetically I don't think they're
5764040	5767840	actually gonna make it I bet you anything 14 gets pushed back to 2011 but
5767840	5771080	just the fact that they kind of had the balls to do it announce the next Final
5771080	5779120	Fantasy game before one's even done is kind of interesting so we'll see other
5779120	5782680	big things announced at Sony's press conference how about ModNation racers
5782680	5786400	that was sweet looking that was a neat looking game Loki would tell us a little
5786400	5791360	bit about this game ModNation racers is gonna be the next of that play create
5791360	5796200	share type of game you know basically like LittleBigPlanet but with a Mario
5796200	5801040	Kart racing game so you've got these you know characters that you create that
5801040	5805240	kind of look like those money characters you know basically design the way your
5805240	5808960	character looks and you give them clothing and stuff like that and then
5808960	5812480	the tracks themselves I mean you could play the tracks that are in the game or
5812480	5816960	you can use this tool that basically is as easy as driving a cart around wherever
5816960	5820960	you want to go and then plopping the landscape down to go along with it and
5820960	5824200	power ups and that kind of stuff so people are gonna be able to make their
5824200	5827960	own levels you know obviously the marker ripoff levels are gonna be in here as
5827960	5833080	well but basically create whatever they want as far as new races have goes and
5833080	5839400	then share it with their friends and it's gonna be cool I can't wait to see
5839400	5844200	how levels get moderated in this game for being Mario Kart courses will be
5844200	5850920	interesting yeah it will be interesting it looks fun though I definitely game I
5850920	5857440	want to pick up a great exclusive franchise for Sony for them I love this
5857440	5860440	back-and-forth going on in chat room about the whole Star Trek online our
5860440	5863000	chat rooms usually about 30 seconds behind the show so sometimes we're a
5863000	5868160	little late reading their comments Rama in chat says space the final frontier
5868160	5873520	these are the voyagers of the starship olr prize Antarctica continues its
5873520	5879360	ongoing mission to seek out new life and new civilizations and blow shit up Rama
5879360	5884960	finishes to boldly go where no geek has gone before very nice very nicely done
5884960	5891640	I like the blow shit up part best let's see uncharted 2 among thieves I know
5891640	5896160	there's a lot of folks very excited about this game I'm not one of them but
5896160	5901240	it looked neat um what I don't know you know what I'm sitting here and I'm
5901240	5909160	holding in my hand a multiplayer beta code for uncharted 2 and you know I I
5909160	5913000	don't really want to use it I don't think Loki wants to use it either dark
5913000	5916640	soccer probably not gonna really play it so I'm thinking we should give this
5916640	5920440	uncharted 2 among thieves code to a listener what do you think let's do it
5920440	5924240	all right here's the thing though is that this listener has to be willing to
5924240	5929760	write something for the website on this so if we give away this beta code we
5929760	5933240	want them to write something for the website with their impressions so that's
5933240	5937520	the deal we give you the code you give us an article so um how do we give it
5937520	5940120	away do we give it away to live we should let the podcasters have a chance
5940120	5943280	at it too right or maybe maybe open it up on Twitter or something I think it
5943280	5947200	should be a match game prize maybe a match game prize later on no I think
5947200	5950560	something a little bit more fair just like yeah I'm actually only two people
5950560	5960000	so let's see maybe um let's see send us an email no I got it send us a tweet
5960000	5964360	because you're restricted to a hundred and forty characters send us a tweet as
5964360	5970240	to why you should get this code okay and then we'll pick the ones we like and
5970240	5973400	pick one at random we don't want to pick our favorite because that's a little too
5973400	5976900	objective we'll take all the ones we like and pull one out at random so if
5976900	5981160	you send us a tweet about better be awesome and not direct message do not do
5981160	5985520	a direct message you got to do at olr and then whatever the message is so and
5985520	5990920	maybe by next show we'll figure out is that too late valid June 3rd through
5990920	5995680	June 28th we probably need to give this away sooner rather than later yeah how
5995680	6001160	about tomorrow yeah mostly post the reply on Twitter the podcast won't be up
6001160	6003160	at tomorrow but maybe I'll post something on the Twitter about the
6003160	6008920	contest tomorrow Friday Thursday maybe let's say midweek Wednesday Wednesday
6008920	6012280	is when the show should go up so we're gonna say by Wednesday if you send us a
6012280	6016040	tweet about why you should get this uncharted to beta code we're gonna take
6016040	6018360	our favorites a randomly pick one and give it to you and then you're gonna
6018360	6024120	write something for our website there you go a 140 character essay I like that
6024120	6028200	so to our favorite tweet at why you should have the uncharted to code and
6028200	6032880	we'll post a reminder on Twitter a little later on exciting all right um
6032880	6037200	let's see other games that were shown at Sony's press conference the last Guardian
6037200	6042440	ooh pretty trailer wasn't that a pretty trailer the new Ico project shadow the
6042440	6046920	Colossus those people it's cool just like you know magical like the other
6046920	6050080	games yeah look kind of pretty but I'm looking forward to seeing more about a
6050080	6054920	Gran Turismo PSP it you know for PSP game it actually look pretty good
6054920	6060640	running at 60 frames per second looks very smooth about fucking time that it
6060640	6065080	came out though seen as it was supposed to be a launch title so they sure take
6065080	6070800	their times on those Gran Turismo games Metal Gear Solid on the PSP as I
6070800	6076360	predicted a game based off of the Metal Gear Solid 3 universe there were you
6076360	6079600	playing as big boss what's kind of interesting though is they're going to
6079600	6085280	have like online co-op or like ad hoc co-op or something like that where you
6085280	6090400	can actually play as each person is like a big boss character which kind of is
6090400	6098000	funny look like clones how about Assassin's Creed 2 you know it's a neat
6098000	6101120	trailer but I just don't really care about that game unfortunately I played
6101120	6104360	the first one didn't like it kind of file it in the whole don't have time to
6104360	6108640	play everything it's sort of yeah it's a neat game they are doing a little bit
6108640	6113800	more with it I think as far as the depth of the game but I mean if you like the
6113800	6117720	first one you're obviously gonna like this obviously we've been talking a lot
6117720	6123480	about the PSP but how can we not mention something about the PSP go $249 for the
6123480	6127240	PSP go are people gonna pay it or did they shoot themselves in the foot that's
6127240	6131780	a tough sell for a system that doesn't have UMD drive on it and I don't give a
6131780	6137200	crap if it has 16 megs or 16 gigabytes of storage you know what I can buy a 16
6137200	6143840	gigabyte card for cheaper than the difference so and and there's a lot of
6143840	6150840	stuff that we don't know that's like kind of as far as specs goes it's a
6150840	6156320	processor better yeah we don't know if it's the same I mean is it got more RAM
6156320	6161760	in it what exactly separates us it obviously now it can't really utilize
6161760	6165480	some of the peripherals I think because of where they've placed different things
6165480	6176640	on it it's a neat idea I guess but I don't know it seems like kind of a waste
6176640	6180520	because they're not really doing anything with this well here's what's
6180520	6184400	interesting is that also one of the big things I said I'm am I gonna be able to
6184400	6189320	play my old UMDs on it and the answer is possibly we haven't heard the final
6189320	6194000	answer yet but apparently Sony isn't developing right now a goodwill program
6194000	6197620	is what they're calling it and basically they're saying it might be similar to
6197620	6201660	portable copy which is how you transfer your blu-ray movies from the ps3 down
6201660	6208060	to the PSP users would not be ripping their UMDs but there'll be some type of
6208060	6212160	digital distribution method on how it so it's gonna be a code in a manual that
6212160	6215360	you're going to basically be able to download it to your system or something
6215360	6219440	like that awesome so what's going to happen is someone's gonna basically by
6219440	6224660	the game dump the code in return the game the end or they're gonna have it
6224660	6229560	where it's your multifamily work for new games but what about the games you have
6229560	6233740	right now see that's the problem is how they going to be able to do that and if
6233740	6237460	it's a kiosk solution where you basically taking to kiosk and it dumps
6237460	6241880	to your system that's a whole other problem right there it just there's no
6241880	6247480	real way I see this working you know other than you know having it be a code
6247480	6252560	manual and even then that's kind of iffy cuz now they say I my friend want to buy
6252560	6259240	the same game assuming that I buy PSP games that I buy the game and then now
6259240	6262520	we both get the game because I can basically share my copy with somebody
6262520	6268040	else and of course Sony's motion controller what about the Sony's motion
6268040	6272320	controller that they showed which basically to kind of summarize I mean
6272320	6274680	I'm sure a lot of you guys have seen it you know I don't want to repeat things
6274680	6278240	you guys I'm sure have been reading up on it but basically it's like imagine
6278240	6282280	you're holding two I mean they look like wiimotes to me to wiimote looking things
6282280	6286480	with balls on the end that that look like I kind of like they look like air
6286480	6290680	traffic control things to me but they light up in these different colors like
6290680	6294160	you can switch the colors and that's supposed to somehow send signals back to
6294160	6297520	the system really it is kind of that patent we saw earlier remember how you
6297520	6300480	talked about how there was this itoy patent and that it was going to be red
6300480	6304120	dots and blue dots at the itoy could see that would differentiate it we thought
6304120	6307200	it was something that was go on the regular controller well it's like this
6307200	6311920	new little motion thing that has the things on it it looked up I mean I'm
6311920	6316760	sorry but the controller looks retarded and you know the only cool thing that
6316760	6320500	they did with it was the augment of reality stuff where like you see
6320500	6324400	yourself and then you when you're moving the thing around it replaces it you know
6324400	6329100	with an object in the game and that's kind of neat but then again the same
6329100	6332440	time who is to say that none of these other systems can do the same thing I
6332440	6335280	mean I like that demo that they were showing when they were doing like kind
6335280	6339400	of the combat thing when they had like the they had like the archery that same
6339400	6344200	thing yeah going on in the the sword fighting thing going on but there were
6344200	6346860	some difficulty in the beginning remember you had a hard time hitting
6346860	6349600	that tennis ball the beginning when they were showing it off and it was a risky
6349600	6353260	thing to show it live so you know props to them for doing that but at the same
6353260	6359580	same time. It's just it. The thing I worry about with these motion controls is how well
6359580	6363500	are they really going to work. You know we kind of went through this with the Wii. When
6363500	6367560	the Wii was announced I think a lot of us are jots at the floor and so forth. And now
6367560	6370500	when we kind of want you know sometimes it doesn't work is now they're telling us they
6370500	6373800	got to have motion plus because it doesn't work as well as they were intended. Here's
6373800	6379860	what I want to the main focus I would like to see with this is what are the limitations.
6379860	6384900	For example with the itoy controller that they have. The motion controller. Basically
6384900	6390080	you have to use these two controllers in order to be able to utilize the game. Now granted
6390080	6397220	it has little buttons and stuff like that on the controllers for different things. That's
6397220	6405400	great but you know who's to say that you couldn't do the same thing with the Microsoft one.
6405400	6409220	You know with maybe like you're holding the Microsoft controller as well or something
6409220	6412720	like that because everybody's got the normal controllers. Who's to say you can't use both
6412720	6416660	or maybe you know use it one handed or something like that or you know maybe they come out
6416660	6419960	with something different you know for like shooters or something like if you really need
6419960	6425260	the controller. But what are the limitations. It seems like with the Microsoft one that
6425260	6430800	there's going to be a lot less limitations since you can use anything anything at all
6430800	6437100	and it will basically you know figure it out for you whereas the Nintendo's you know controllers
6437100	6443660	and you know too much lesser extent the PlayStation controllers are limited by the controllers
6443660	6448020	themselves. Nintendo is bad because they now they actually have to add extra sensors to
6448020	6452860	make it more sensitive how they wanted originally and still tied down by the IR and stuff like
6452860	6458620	that you have to be facing the TV and the same thing with you know the the PlayStation
6458620	6463020	I sensors or whatever now with these balls of color which hey I do like the fact though
6463020	6469340	that it uses an already existing camera meaning that is not expensive that is nice but you
6469340	6473660	know I'd also like to see the price point of the Microsoft one as well and at the same
6473660	6478560	time now now you have to buy the camera and you have to buy the controllers for this so
6478560	6484900	it might still add up to it being expensive in you know the camera is really kind of useless
6484900	6492140	anyways right now. I mean I know because I own the cameras for both the vision camera
6492140	6497340	and the PlayStation I and honestly haven't used either one of them really I mean other
6497340	6503620	than trying out totem ball which sucked but it's just they're kind of useless and I mean
6503620	6508780	Sony is doing a little bit more with the PlayStation I camera like they have the iPad thing coming
6508780	6513180	out they've got you know some cool implementations for like you know photos and stuff like that
6513180	6518300	and little big planets you know then the normal face mapping stuff for like the EA Sports
6518300	6525060	games and stuff like that but I just don't I don't know they're going to make this controller
6525060	6529380	a lot better looking and I know it's a prototype and I want to read this comment from chat
6529380	6534440	because here Legend of Zaku in chat says Jesus Christ is a goddamn prototype remember that
6534440	6538580	the PS3 controller is still in development so everything you saw last week is a prototype
6538580	6543540	tech demo so the final versions of very once it's released well yeah but at the same time
6543540	6548540	this is you know Sony is in front of the world showing it what is going to be playing in
6548540	6553180	the next year so while there might be slight variations I mean this is what they are planning
6553180	6557460	right now and unless something freaking major happens this this is going to be what it is
6557460	6564020	next year see this to me looks like almost like a copy of like a Wii remote basically
6564020	6570980	it's kind of what they're all how can we mimic what the Wii remote does but you know make
6570980	6576900	it a little bit better and you know not use the same technology so don't get sued that's
6576900	6581260	what this seems like whereas the Microsoft one was like how can we do something that's
6581260	6586460	motion control but different and better and some folks in chatter invoking the PlayStation
6586460	6589860	3 boomerang like GSAC it just changed his nickname like remember when the PlayStation
6589860	6592760	3 controller was supposed to look like that boomerang yes and thank God they didn't do
6592760	6596660	that because of all the negative reaction they didn't end up doing that so yeah you
6596660	6600260	know Sony has been known to go back to the drawing board when they get negative reception
6600260	6605100	so could something like that happen here yes and I just I think the whole setup is going
6605100	6609980	to be really it's going to suck because you know once again going back to the Microsoft
6609980	6614940	one you know trying to sound like a fanboy here but all you need is a camera done you
6614940	6619360	got the camera you play four players 16 players whatever the game is going to support because
6619360	6624540	you are the controller now let's go to Sony you need their camera you need a controller
6624540	6628700	for each person or in this case this one game uses two controllers so how many controllers
6628700	6631980	are they unbundled together am I got to buy each one separately well I have issues with
6631980	6634460	the camera thing but we'll get to that when we get to Microsoft press conference yeah
6634460	6637540	I think you do need both I think you do need the controller in the camera but we'll get
6637540	6641760	to that when we get to Microsoft's thing I mean my Microsoft definitely has the ability
6641760	6646540	to prove me wrong and I hope they do but we'll get to that in a little bit let's kind of
6646540	6649740	wrap up with Sony did you have anything else you want to mention as Sony's camp I know
6649740	6655860	one other thing I want to mention White Knight Chronicles was a really cool ask really yet
6655860	6661180	actually one of our listeners was was kind of we ran into him around the White Knight
6661180	6664360	Chronicles booth and we had a lot of good things to say about the game and I watched
6664360	6669940	Loki play it and it's a very pretty looking game I had it described as Final Fantasy 12
6669940	6676260	meets Xenogears and it was it was a very very pretty looking game I'm definitely interested
6676260	6681820	in it yeah look you actually played it I had to watch you play that one what did you think
6681820	6686260	of White Knight Chronicles how did it control it controlled fine it was just basically target
6686260	6691160	something and then you had macros and pick which macro you want to you know which attack
6691160	6695060	you want to do and then you can also set up a macro combo of attacks and stuff like that
6695060	6703340	and I don't know it seemed easy but you know it was neat SSJ 100 Matt going back to the
6703340	6708060	motion control in chat room chat.orangeonsrated.com says I think the fact that he gave a release
6708060	6712020	date is what's bothering me spring 2010 is too they never stick to the release dates
6712020	6719900	ever home got delayed how long ever the PlayStation 3 got delayed how long they never stick to
6719900	6726140	release dates and why they even decided to do that is beyond me I I'm I want to I need
6726140	6730200	to go grab some more water so talk more about Sony with our listeners looking okay so other
6730200	6735940	things that Sony announced obviously there's a lot of stuff that was coming to their console
6735940	6740980	including the PSP of course other things Resident Evil portable was announced which is pretty
6740980	6746780	sweet we talked a little bit about Metal Gear Solid Peace Walker the PSP version there that
6746780	6752820	was pretty cool coming to both the 360 and ps3 and I think we may get into this a little
6752820	6758960	bit more but they have the new Metal Gear Solid Rising or the Raiden one yeah that's
6758960	6763840	actually I wanted to find out if they did anything on that because I actually like Raiden
6763840	6772860	yeah kind of cool and then you know there's they announced more stuff coming to home but
6772860	6779000	I kind of zoned out when that happened the biggest announcement I think well they really
6779000	6782980	show anything so it can't be that big of an announcement for me but Rockstar announced
6782980	6786980	a new game franchise it's gonna be exclusive to the ps3 called agent that was gonna be
6786980	6791700	about secret agents and stuff like that the problem I have with this those they also announced
6791700	6798380	that you know franchise noir as gonna be a PlayStation exclusive at one time and we still
6798380	6803940	haven't even seen that yet so let's finish one franchise first before we start announcing
6803940	6812380	another one that's my thing though and then I did actually get to play the Motorstorm
6812380	6820300	Arctic I forget the subtitle but the new Arctic themed Motorstorm game on the PSP that's pretty
6820300	6828300	fun like a normal Motorstorm game actually look pretty good on the PSP I watched was
6828300	6832940	it I you know they're White Knight Chronicles I watched some of the God of War stuff you
6832940	6839820	know it looks just like you know normal God of War games they didn't really have I was
6839820	6850700	hoping to play that others PSP games really have they have the add-on for a wipeout HD
6850700	6858980	looked okay yeah but I kind of got a brief overview of everything that they had at Sony's
6858980	6862220	booth and you know they got some pretty good stuff coming I didn't really see anything
6862220	6867060	though on Gran Turismo 5 I mean they did announce Gran Turismo 5 is coming it's gonna be in
6867060	6878620	400 cars you know great that it has 400 cars but you know the same time Forza 3 they announced
6878620	6886740	the launch date for it and it's this fall so you better hurry cuz that looks pretty
6886740	6892660	good too and honestly 400 cars sounds good but we really need 400 cars I wouldn't know
6892660	6897980	which one to pick I wouldn't know either alright we need to do some of our regular segments
6897980	6901860	here before we get to Microsoft's press conference you know it wouldn't be a week if we didn't
6901860	6907280	say something angsty so let's do our FUs of the week folks how's that sound even though
6907280	6912540	we haven't had anything angsty to bring this on but I don't know you know what I could
6912540	6915940	say something angsty to invoke this would be how much stuff we didn't get to see at
6915940	6920180	E3 there were way too many booths with way too much stuff behind closed doors what are
6920180	6924500	you so afraid of so anyway bring on the angst
6924500	6949420	um FU to not being able to go to E3 so that's blatant and for being somewhat sick okay
6949420	6959180	FU to the Australian family that was eating next to us on Friday night I forget the restaurant
6959180	6966580	but they were famous for ribs anyways apparently they like to yell a lot and talk about how
6966580	6973700	their aunt and uncle have sex right in front of their kids so FU to them because they were
6973700	6980700	loud and obnoxious and we were making fun of them all weekend long so yeah they they
6980700	6987420	suck um I don't really have a lot of FUs you know I had the week off of work and that's
6987420	6990460	always something to be excited about so FU to the fact that I have to go back to the
6990460	6999580	old work tomorrow oh I got one more FU to my work for not actually finalizing my payment
6999580	7005060	for my hotel that I stayed at in downtown LA sticking me with an $800 bill because they
7005060	7012860	didn't um either they screwed up or E3 housing screwed up and my company which was supposed
7012860	7018220	to have you know faxed an authorization for their credit card um that didn't happen and
7018220	7024340	so I had to pay like $600 more than I was expecting oh screwed them we usually get reimbursed
7024340	7031820	right I better fucking get reimbursed there you go ticket to man all right one of our
7031820	7035260	other segments we always have to do here every week on the show is the part where you get
7035260	7039100	to interact with us and that's where you send us emails at mailbag at orange lounge reader
7039100	7044420	dot com and every week the lovely dark stalker jumps into the mailbag head first and uh lands
7044420	7049660	with a few uh few emails on her forehead so uh she's gonna pick out some of her favorites
7049660	7058660	and read them for you right now mailbag the first one comes from taz well loki you called
7058660	7062900	it seeing how the lego games have been in the past year this one probably is going to
7062900	7066700	turn out to be better than the rest of the harry potter games out there this is supposedly
7066700	7072220	from years one through four and i'm and i'm guess we will see years five through seven
7072220	7076940	and then some perhaps when movie eight comes out in 2011 i'm wondering if the game will
7076940	7084340	follow the same lego star wars formula or would it go all new on us anyways i know i
7084340	7089980	know have game for my soon-to-be wife which i'm probably going to enjoy as well the game
7089980	7094620	you pervs thank you obviously he's talking about legos harry potter that got announced
7094620	7099380	that it was coming out big surprise there um the only good thing about that is that
7099380	7102140	means that toys are coming back because my wife was asking me about that we actually
7102140	7107020	went to the lego store that was on downtown disney oh nice um but no lego harry potter
7107020	7112540	uh weird stuff so they hopefully will re-release toys when that comes up um i would not bet
7112540	7115980	they're gonna do anything new i think they have to stay pretty true to the books i think
7115980	7120120	that might be some type of agreement i think he was saying as far as new as gameplay wise
7120120	7125540	compared to the other lego indian jones stuff i wouldn't expect anything maybe the magic
7125540	7132660	element but that's probably as far as you're gonna get so that's it the next one is um
7132660	7138180	from cheeseburger hey guys you've been talking about your itunes ranking and how people leaving
7138180	7142740	negative reviews pushes you back a few pages well i've been thinking that when people subscribe
7142740	7147460	to a podcast that podcast rank will go up so is everyone unsubscribed and then resubscribed
7147460	7152340	to olr in one week your rank would skyrocket am i right or is this just a load of crap
7152340	7157060	i guess we could just test it out this week like set a date for the and then resubscription
7157060	7164780	to olr oh and he wouldn't need to verify your email address um there's two ways that itunes
7164780	7169220	rank shows and the one where it has like five pages of featured shows quote unquote we're
7169220	7173600	not even on it anymore five pages of video game shows we're not even there anymore so
7173600	7178340	i don't know you know i just just like i said word of mouth is all we got guys so i've kind
7178340	7184140	of given up on the whole itunes thing um although yeah i think as far as the popular podcast
7184140	7188420	you could probably unsubscribe and resubscribe but i'm going to tell you what coordinating
7188420	7193980	that whole effort to get us to number 30 or whatever on the charts whatever it would do
7193980	7198820	that would not have half the impact that those same people actually telling to people to
7198820	7205160	download our show would have so while i appreciate the effort to boost the itunes ranking if
7205160	7209640	you want to take that passion and focus it elsewhere i think there could be a better
7209640	7215460	payoff so again you know we don't have money to fund commercials or anything you know again
7215460	7221020	we are a uh independent operation out of a spare bedroom you know that's that's what
7221020	7224820	it is so if you enjoy what we've been doing for the past seven years tell people about
7224820	7233140	it that's all we ask um there's an email that i don't think i can read okay skip it do the
7233140	7237020	next one it doesn't have punctuation let's do the next one then sorry you don't have
7237020	7242020	to read them all i know but i will i usually like to read them as much as i can um but
7242020	7248300	someone who really likes pepsi throwback which i've had me who does not like soda i still
7248300	7253580	haven't had it it's good is it it tastes like old except it still has that oh my god i just
7253580	7259420	sucked a spoonful of sugar aftertaste which is like honey but anyway where can i get it
7259420	7266140	walmart everywhere i haven't seen it i swear the gas station down the street from my house
7266140	7274620	i'll check that out okay um this is the last one and it's a bit long um and it is from
7274620	7283500	i think spazzinator so i will just hop right on in and read it hi everyone i thought that
7283500	7288500	i'd write in in order to bring up a few interrelated topics for today's show being today's assuming
7288500	7293540	there is a show today yep there is you're listening to it hopefully before i get to
7293540	7298060	the topics hand i'd like to apologize in advance if this email runs unusually long as i am
7298060	7303860	combining two weeks worth of topics into one email first off in regards to what sky mentioned
7303860	7308180	on the previous week's show coming back to final fantasy 11 i'd like to say congrats
7308180	7313060	you had made a fine choice if i um if i may i'd at least like to think that i may have
7313060	7316340	possibly played a small role in influencing you and returning to the game considering
7316340	7321660	that i'm always talking about lolr how your return to venetial how's your return to venetial
7321660	7327540	so far if you happen to be on either odin or alexander and see a tarot tarot named dare
7327540	7334520	won't dare won't i can't i'm not on either of those servers anyway so i'm not gonna see
7334520	7340820	i'm sorry that this is that would be me i play on bismarck oh never mind it's it's japanese
7340820	7348980	is okay um on final on a final fantasy related note
7348980	7354780	what are your impressions of the announcement trailer from e3 regarding the previous unannounced
7354780	7358500	final fantasy i think we've been over this um personally i have mixed feelings about
7358500	7363780	it on one hand being a big old final fantasy experience fan that i am i'd rather i'm rather
7363780	7367540	excited about any upcoming final fantasy game and new story experience points that each
7367540	7374100	game brings on the other hand i'm concerned that final fantasy 14 being an mmo will cannibalize
7374100	7379980	final fantasy 11's user base hell for all i know final fantasy 11 may and i stress the
7379980	7385300	word may shut down as a result even though i do plan to play 14 i still don't want to
7385300	7389460	leave 11 or see any aspect of it suffer as a result the game has a damn good storyline
7389460	7394340	and community um there will always be people out there wanting to play 11 you just might
7394340	7398500	see some of the server consolidations and those types of things is that yeah inevitably
7398500	7402460	some of the user base is going to go over to 14 that's just what happens but then again
7402460	7408200	look at ever quest and ever quest 2 uh when ever quest 2 came out you know not a lot of
7408200	7414020	people wanted to leave ever quest 1 and ever quest 2 kind of suffered because of that however
7414020	7418420	i think there's a lot different going on here i mean for one it's final fantasy for another
7418420	7423360	you have a lot of people and i can't stress this enough you have a lot of people who used
7423360	7428140	to play 11 and left because things weren't fixed but i think there's gonna they're gonna
7428140	7434140	want to give 14 a try so is it possible for both games to coexist yeah but i think 11
7434140	7437620	will probably shrink down significantly in size but i think there'll always be people
7437620	7443020	playing 11 somewhere there's still people playing ever quest exactly there's probably
7443020	7450300	more people playing ever quest 1 than ever quest 2 so um but as far as the trailer when
7450300	7454820	i saw the final fantasy 14 trailer uh let me just put it this way i looked up and saw
7454820	7462120	final fantasy 14 and then i jizzed in my pants can i move on now please yes as a broader
7462120	7467340	question what's everyone's impressions of this year's e3 um far away what do you what
7467340	7470660	do you feel the high points as well as the low points additionally do you feel that there
7470660	7475940	was a clear-cut winner between microsoft um nintendo or sony's conferences as a result
7475940	7479660	of e3 would you say there's anything coming out between now and early next year that you're
7479660	7484260	particularly psyched about well i think of this this show is going to kind of hit on
7484260	7487300	all those points it's kind of what we built the show around tonight but i will say i will
7487300	7491940	address the conference question between is there a clear winner between microsoft sony
7491940	7496540	and nintendo and i'm going to say no there is no clear winner between the three i think
7496540	7503220	the twitter conference wins i i guess i guess but i there there is no winner in my opinion
7503220	7509240	because not enough is out there right now i think uh microsoft had a really good showing
7509240	7514060	the the only thing i think holding me back from sony uh as far as you know grading them
7514060	7518500	as high as microsoft is a lot of their stuff that they announced and granted microsoft
7518500	7524980	is capable of this as well a lot of it is not coming out anytime soon you know uh microsoft
7524980	7528740	you know they had you know crackdown 2 and stuff that they announced which will be getting
7528740	7534500	into more of that stuff you know 2010 stuff but a lot of it they did announce with dates
7534500	7540020	and time frames like this is coming out october you know this is coming out then instead of
7540020	7545580	you know final fantasy 14 that's not coming out until like what next year that's part
7545580	7550560	of our 10-year strategy exactly or like final fantasy 13 that's not coming out until next
7550560	7556300	year or you know god of war 3 that's not coming out until next year um you know really the
7556300	7563360	only games that they showed that were coming out this year were uncharted 2 and that's
7563360	7564360	That's about it.
7564360	7567400	I mean, so a lot of the stuff that they're talking about, you know, maybe White Knight
7567400	7570920	Chronicles, I'm not sure about that, but a lot of it is all next year.
7570920	7572680	It's that 10 year plan.
7572680	7576800	And that's great that you're announcing stuff that's coming out, but Microsoft is announcing
7576800	7582000	stuff that's coming out this year, and stuff that's coming out next year, and you know
7582000	7583000	what?
7583000	7585720	When it comes to next year, they will have more stuff to announce that's coming out,
7585720	7586720	you know?
7586720	7587720	That's the thing.
7587720	7589640	That's what separates those two companies.
7589640	7595920	Sony likes to promise a lot, but it takes a long time for them to come through with
7595920	7597760	what they promise.
7597760	7603040	And you know, Microsoft does the same thing to a lesser extent, I think, but I've just
7603040	7608960	gotten tired of listening to what Sony has to say and promise, and know really what's
7608960	7609960	gonna happen.
7609960	7614960	Like, you know, Final Fantasy XIV, and granted that's not really up to Sony, but probably
7614960	7617440	not coming out in 2010.
7617440	7620160	Alright, we'll see.
7620160	7621160	Was that it for emails?
7621160	7622160	Any others?
7622160	7623400	Oh, there was more to that one.
7623400	7624400	Oh, okay.
7624400	7629280	Um, for those of you that care, there's been some interesting stuff happening in the PSN
7629280	7630680	store within the last two weeks.
7630680	7636360	Sony's been continuing to put more PS1 classics on there, most of which are pretty damn good.
7636360	7640400	Two noticeable ones for Resident Evil, director's cut complete with Jill sandwiches, and wait
7640400	7642220	for it, Final Fantasy VII.
7642220	7643760	You bought that, didn't you?
7643760	7649640	I sure did, and I have yet to play it, because then I, literally as Final Fantasy VII was
7649640	7653840	downloading, I remembered that Final Fantasy IV after years had come out on Wii, and I
7653840	7656280	was like, no, I wanna play that!
7656280	7659940	So I haven't gotten back to playing VII yet, keep in mind I was gone most of the week.
7659940	7665320	And that's good that they have stuff to download now, some of their older PlayStation 1 classics,
7665320	7670680	because they sure as hell aren't filling up their store full of new PlayStation Network
7670680	7673680	games.
7673680	7674680	True.
7674680	7676680	I guess they need something to keep them afloat.
7676680	7678680	There's more to this email.
7678680	7679680	Okay.
7679680	7682520	Um, where was I, okay.
7682520	7688320	Once Jack Trenton mentioned that Final Fantasy VII was coming to the US PSN store, nearly,
7688320	7691380	it says nearly I guess it's supposed to say every Final Fantasy fan collectively just
7691380	7695080	their pants, um, no.
7695080	7700440	They also added a bunch of other stuff on the game side, too numerous to mention.
7700440	7704400	Additionally, they have expanded their offerings on the video side of the store to include
7704400	7708480	somewhere in the ballpark of 10 to 15 more supported TV networks, including Showtime
7708480	7709480	and G4.
7709480	7715720	Additionally, they're giving away, um, for free, uh, two TV show pilots, um, Dexter from
7715720	7717600	Showtime as well as Voltron.
7717600	7723440	On a side note, although it's been on the video store, um, for a while now, I'd like
7723440	7727080	to recommend that you check out this one anime series called Burst Angel.
7727080	7730520	It's kind of difficult to describe, but it's essentially Charlie's Angels combined with
7730520	7734400	X-Files with a dash of mechs and political corruption.
7734400	7736560	Sounds odd, but it's a pretty good series.
7736560	7740200	Considering that I usually don't watch anime, that's really high praise coming from me.
7740200	7742700	Well, thanks for taking the time to read my email.
7742700	7743700	It's appreciated.
7743700	7746480	Again, sorry, especially to DarkSakura who usually ends up reading the emails.
7746480	7748800	Thank you for such a long email.
7748800	7752680	I do like how they are adding more anime studios to that because I think that's something that
7752680	7757820	diversifies them a little bit, I'm not sure what their anime, um, you know, coverage is
7757820	7762760	for the 360, but I know, I don't think there's that much on there.
7762760	7766760	But that's kind of cool to diversify themselves a little bit with that.
7766760	7773920	Um, I don't know, it's just, uh, one thing I do have a problem with though is G4.
7773920	7774920	Really?
7774920	7775920	G4?
7775920	7778420	I mean, am I really gonna have to pay for shows that they repeat on their station like
7778420	7779720	eight times a day?
7779720	7785320	I mean, they only have, like, a handful of shows left and they just repeat cops and cheaters.
7785320	7788720	I mean, are we gonna get episodes of cops and cheaters?
7788720	7791520	I mean, is that gonna be part of the lineup?
7791520	7797560	Awesome, I want the Excuse My Beauty transsexual episode, which I believe was Albuquerque Police.
7797560	7800440	I would pay for that episode, I would, so I could watch that.
7800440	7806240	Uh, Excuse My Beauty, officer, I'll go back to Arizona, I swear.
7806240	7810980	If you haven't seen it, YouTube, Excuse My Beauty, it's amazing.
7810980	7812980	That episode I would buy.
7812980	7814720	The rest of that G4 crap can go burn.
7814720	7820760	Unless it's, like, classic G4 stuff, like, you know, old episodes of, uh, Starrcade or
7820760	7823160	something like that, but I doubt it.
7823160	7827440	Uh, XLink in chat wants to point out G4 is free on iTunes.
7827440	7830840	Brad from Pop Culture says, Cops is on Hulu, ooh, I didn't realize that.
7830840	7835480	Sephiroth1215 says, speaking about the Sony press conference, I mean, we have to think
7835480	7836680	of the years as fiscal.
7836680	7840520	A lot of companies end their fiscal years in March, so they can release games up till
7840520	7844800	that point and be keeping the truth of coming out this year.
7844800	7845800	Yes and no.
7845800	7848360	I still think a lot of this stuff when they say 2010, they don't mean March.
7848360	7849360	They mean, like, October.
7849360	7854080	They should say this fiscal year instead of this year, because that, I'm sorry, that's,
7854080	7855080	I think-
7855080	7856080	Lying by admission.
7856080	7861560	I think the only games that might come out before holiday 2010 are Final Fantasy 13 and,
7861560	7863320	at least in Japan.
7863320	7868080	And uh, that's why I don't think 14's gonna come out in 2010, because I think 13's gonna
7868080	7869560	barely make the holidays.
7869560	7870560	So I think-
7870560	7872560	But it's a different team working on it, so I could see that happening.
7872560	7875640	That would be so weird if that happened.
7875640	7878880	So uh, and then, uh, God of War 3 I think will come out early.
7878880	7879880	No.
7879880	7880880	No, you don't think so?
7880880	7881880	March, for sure.
7881880	7882880	Oh, March.
7882880	7883880	Not.
7883880	7885240	They already announced it's March.
7885240	7886240	I see.
7886240	7887520	So, well, okay, then that's before the holidays.
7887520	7888520	So there you go.
7888520	7890560	Uncharted 2 will be the big holiday game for them.
7890560	7894480	Um, Mag was another game that they were showing off that I don't know if is gonna be out this
7894480	7895480	year.
7895480	7896480	It looked cool.
7896480	7897480	I watched people playing it.
7897480	7900760	I mean, if you're into like Call of Duty and stuff, you're really gonna enjoy that game,
7900760	7905840	because it's, you know, a massive battleground, basically, of, you know, everything that you've
7905840	7911120	seen in Call of Duty and, um, all your multiplayer first person shooter games.
7911120	7912880	So that'd be kinda cool if that comes out this year.
7912880	7915080	I'm not sure if it is.
7915080	7917000	Um.
7917000	7921000	I would hope that they put out Gran Turismo 5 this year, because I think they kinda have
7921000	7922000	to.
7922000	7929080	You know, with Forza 3 coming out, I mean, I don't know, um, and then, as far as what
7929080	7933200	they're gonna fill in the rest of the year with, that's a good question, because I don't
7933200	7934280	really know.
7934280	7939480	I mean, Heavy Rain is supposed to be coming out this year, I thought.
7939480	7943000	That wasn't even there, at all.
7943000	7944560	Nothing.
7944560	7946160	No mention of it at all.
7946160	7947160	Alright.
7947160	7953560	Uh, I believe that was all the emails we got, so if you wanna send us more, mailbag at orangelandrader.com.
7953560	7957920	Let's move on to Microsoft, and then we'll let, uh, Loki throw in anything else he wants
7957920	7960560	to, because I know he's probably got some other games he wants to talk about, and then,
7960560	7962440	uh, wrap up with just a couple phone calls.
7962440	7965560	Probably not gonna take a lot of phone calls tonight, just because we've been chatting
7965560	7967680	a long time tonight, but we'll do what we can.
7967680	7971560	Uh, anyhow, I wanna talk about Microsoft and some of the things they talked about at their
7971560	7972560	press conference.
7972560	7977800	Let's start with the big one, which is Project Natal, um, which obviously, you know, I, I'm
7977800	7981960	pretty sure you guys are all aware, it's the motion controller that's camera only, there
7981960	7985640	is no controller with it, I don't know if you've watched the trailer that goes with
7985640	7990920	it, but it's very interesting, because the scene that struck me specifically was, when
7990920	7995520	the girl walks into the room, and the Xbox 360 know who she is, and she gets a phone
7995520	8000240	call from her friend, or whatever, on the 360, and her friend says, hey, I picked out
8000240	8004040	this cute new outfit for you, you should try it on, and she kinda looks back and forth,
8004040	8007720	and she actually is seeing herself on the TV in the outfit her friend picked out for
8007720	8008720	her.
8008720	8009720	Okay, that I don't buy, that's retarded.
8009720	8015000	Which, which, by the way, reminded me of the movie Clueless, from 1990s, right, remember
8015000	8018600	when Alicia Silverstone goes in the closet, and she can see what outfit she's wearing
8018600	8019600	that day?
8019600	8020600	Yeah.
8020600	8022600	It's 1994, y'all!
8022600	8027880	Anyhow, all that aside, that's crazy, let's just talk about Project Natal, I don't know,
8027880	8030640	what were your thoughts?
8030640	8031640	I think it's really cool.
8031640	8035280	I thought, wow, this is really good, and I set them apart from Nintendo, they can do
8035280	8041040	a lot more with this, if it actually lives up to all the stuff that they say it can do.
8041040	8047640	And, I mean, they have kind of demonstrated, you know, the, their live demonstration of
8047640	8053040	how, like, playing that giant Breakout game, which, it's a cool tech demo, but god, I hope
8053040	8058440	that's not actually a game, you know, but it looked pretty innovative and easy to use,
8058440	8062320	granted the person playing the game looked like a complete idiot, but hey, whatever,
8062320	8067800	I mean, if that's, I'm sure playing Wii games people look like idiots, but, it looked easy
8067800	8072560	to use, looked very intuitive, and I like some of the, I mean, it's very unnecessary
8072560	8078920	as far as, like, browsing, you know, your menus and stuff by swishing your hand around,
8078920	8083440	I mean, that's cool and all, but I'll just use the controller, because it's a lot faster,
8083440	8088480	but you have the option, I mean, you don't have to do it that way, but then again, if
8088480	8095000	I'm trying to, you know, shoo away my cat, I don't want it moving through menus, so,
8095000	8100240	we'll see how that ends up, it could be really cool, and, I don't know, if they could come
8100240	8103720	up with maybe, like, a one-handed controller or something like that, something really small,
8103720	8106760	almost like the nunchuck or something, so you can, you know, say, like, you're playing
8106760	8109240	a game- The Buzz controller, or, I'm not Buzz, sorry,
8109240	8110240	the scenic controller.
8110240	8114760	Yeah, something like that, you know, very small, so you can have some of that, you know,
8114760	8118240	controller stuff, and then doing, you know, motion stuff with your other hands or something,
8118240	8121240	like some of the things I think were unnecessary, like, that they showed in the video, like
8121240	8125680	the driving, I don't want to have to hold my hands out, like a steering wheel, that's
8125680	8132080	not for me, I mean, I'd rather not do that in the pit crew game, or whatever, where you
8132080	8137280	change your tire, that is one of the slowest pits I've ever seen, and, no thanks, I would
8137280	8141320	not want to have to play that little stupid minigame, or have someone else play that stupid
8141320	8147600	minigame while I'm driving, because I'd be yelling at them for going too slow.
8147600	8148600	Not for NASCAR fans.
8148600	8153400	The skateboarding stuff looked kind of neat, I mean, the scanning stuff in, it's not going
8153400	8158160	to work like they showed it, because the kid's hands in front of the skateboard, and obviously
8158160	8162440	that wouldn't work, but it's a neat idea that you can scan stuff in there, and you can do
8162440	8167200	that now, as it is with, you know, the cameras, you can scan your face to put it in games,
8167200	8169080	so that's fine.
8169080	8173820	The Avatar control was kind of wonky when they've shown it, because it had trouble figuring
8173820	8178040	out where his hands were, so he's doing this cross arm thing, but you know what, that's
8178040	8182260	happened in other things I've seen before, that have to do with, like, you know, like
8182260	8184960	the little big planet characters, sometimes when you're controlling their arms, they get
8184960	8187000	all wonky like that.
8187000	8193440	So it looks neat, if it comes out in a relatively quick time frame, I think they'll be good.
8193440	8197160	I'm not sure if it was supposed to be coming out this year, or next.
8197160	8198160	It's gotta be next.
8198160	8199500	I mean, it doesn't even have a name yet.
8199500	8202920	It's Project Natal, that's not what they're going to market it as.
8202920	8205440	So I don't know, we'll see.
8205440	8207200	That sounds like a prescription drug's name, by the way.
8207200	8211580	I am extremely, extremely skeptical about this.
8211580	8215000	I don't think it's going to work as nice as they're showing it in these trailers and things,
8215000	8219360	and this whole concept of people don't want to have buttons and stuff, that's just not
8219360	8220360	true.
8220360	8222440	I'm sorry, but I don't think that's true.
8222440	8226480	And the whole thing about, well, people get intimidated by all these buttons and things,
8226480	8227600	I don't buy it.
8227600	8232180	You know what, there's one device everybody knows how to use, everybody fights over it
8232180	8238060	all the time, when somebody loses it, people have hell to pay, it's the remote control.
8238060	8240240	Everybody knows how to use a remote control.
8240240	8242960	And that's what the Nintendo was kind of going for when they made the Wii, right?
8242960	8245200	They want to make that Wiimote kind of like a remote control.
8245200	8249000	So I don't think this whole concept of you have to get rid of the controller.
8249000	8250800	But this is bait for idiots.
8250800	8252920	That's all it really is, it's bait for idiots.
8252920	8257840	Because you know what, they're basically relying on marketing this to the people that have
8257840	8263400	the Wii, and they're like, oh my god, look at this, it's a game, it's without controllers.
8263400	8267000	I don't have to worry about throwing it through the TV, I can play all these mini games that,
8267000	8272940	or just like on the Wii, and guess what, the console's cheaper, and it looks better.
8272940	8276360	And you know, you have all this stuff, you can do movies and all that kind of stuff,
8276360	8278000	it's your air-tainment hub.
8278000	8279320	I get it, I get it.
8279320	8280320	They're gonna have that.
8280320	8283840	But I just, you know, the fanboys are going crazy with this 360 thing.
8283840	8286760	And I'm sorry, call me whatever name you want.
8286760	8290360	I'm extremely skeptical about this whole thing, and I have a right to be.
8290360	8293760	Because the Xbox Vision camera sucks.
8293760	8295200	It sucks.
8295200	8296640	What can you do with that camera?
8296640	8297640	Exactly.
8297640	8300240	Especially compared to what they showed us years ago.
8300240	8304840	When they first showed us the camera, we were promised all these games that were gonna integrate
8304840	8305840	the camera.
8305840	8306840	And what do you have?
8306840	8310800	You have Uno and some of the other Xbox Live Arcade games, and a couple third-party developers
8310800	8315320	threw us a few bones there with the EA, you know, you have the Burnout license plate,
8315320	8316520	big fucking deal.
8316520	8320680	And then you have the, you're in the movies.
8320680	8322460	And then Totem Ball.
8322460	8325960	And remember when Totem Ball kind of looked fun from the previews that we were showing
8325960	8328280	at that E3 when the Vision camera was announced?
8328280	8330640	Now, Totem Ball might have actually been kind of cool.
8330640	8333120	It was shit.
8333120	8336960	And the way you controlled that whole thing, it doesn't, the same thing with the iToy.
8336960	8339800	It is never picking up your body correctly.
8339800	8341160	It doesn't see your motion right.
8341160	8346240	If you don't have exactly the right lighting in your house, the thing sucks.
8346240	8349240	And if you don't believe me, check out some of those iToy games on the PlayStation 2.
8349240	8350240	They're terrible.
8350240	8355840	So I think seeing this whole, you know, motion and movement is how we're gonna control our
8355840	8356840	games.
8356840	8358320	I'm extremely skeptical about it.
8358320	8359320	I have a right to be.
8359320	8361840	I've seen this before and it sucks.
8361840	8363320	Why should I feel any different now?
8363320	8365660	The technology has gotten way better.
8365660	8369800	They actually have a company that's already perfected this and being implemented.
8369800	8375520	It was actually implemented with a regular webcam at one time, but they've shown this
8375520	8376520	at CES.
8376520	8377520	It works.
8377520	8381860	They've already gotten, you know, tech demos and games and stuff, you know, utilizing this.
8381860	8386360	Microsoft bought the company and now they're working exclusively with them to put out this
8386360	8387360	technology.
8387360	8393400	And I do understand, trust me, I bought cameras for all those systems and they all pissed
8393400	8394400	me off.
8394400	8399960	And yes, I'm very skeptical on buying another camera that, you know, possibly not gonna
8399960	8401040	work like I see it.
8401040	8405600	And yes, I need to see it actually being used before I want to go buy this.
8405600	8407800	But the technology is a lot different.
8407800	8410280	They say, you know, now it's not utilizing your vision.
8410280	8412160	It can track you.
8412160	8417200	It can distinguish you between you and someone that's waving their arms in the background.
8417200	8421320	You know, all that kind of stuff really helps because, you know, if I'm in the wrong lighting
8421320	8424920	or something like that and it's not gonna be able to see me, you know, what the hell?
8424920	8430480	So yes, and if it is gonna be as crappy and shoddy as those other cameras that have been
8430480	8433520	out before, then there's no reason for anyone to buy this.
8433520	8436200	But I have a feeling it's not gonna be like that.
8436200	8437440	They've heard the complaints.
8437440	8439520	It's, you know, it's gotta work.
8439520	8440520	Let me read some comments from chat.
8440520	8445200	There's a cypher in our chat room, chat.ornisontrated.com says, Johnny Chung Lee, the guy who did head
8445200	8447520	tracking with the Wii is working on Natal.
8447520	8450080	It has to work because he is pure genius.
8450080	8453240	Tiger Claw says, in order for it to pick up the entire room, it's gotta be a widescreen
8453240	8457280	view of the area so that everyone can be involved, insinuating that it's probably a widescreen
8457280	8458280	camera.
8458280	8461600	Well, it's a camera, but it's also got like other sensors on it too.
8461600	8464340	So it's not just, you know, it's gonna be infrared.
8464340	8469240	I think it's infrared because it looks like there's two infrared sensors on it or something
8469240	8471620	unless those are just indicator lights for different stuff.
8471620	8477260	But yeah, it's, the camera's really wide and it, you know, whether it's gonna be like echolocation
8477260	8480440	or something like that, I'm not sure.
8480440	8483280	But the camera is unusually wide.
8483280	8485020	I want to keep reading comments from chat.
8485020	8486020	Great stuff from chat tonight.
8486020	8491020	Sephiroth1215 says, I feel more satisfied with the Sony Wiimote because while it might
8491020	8494820	just be practically the same, it will be nice to play games with it that are meant for the
8494820	8497560	core gamer, which Nintendo doesn't do.
8497560	8502560	Zeba says, and in all the videos I've seen with it, their living rooms have so much room
8502560	8503960	in front of the TV.
8503960	8507480	I don't know any house that has that much room in front of the TV like that.
8507480	8509320	Well, it's also a set.
8509320	8510320	Yeah, true.
8510320	8512580	But I mean, that makes a good point.
8512580	8514600	Will this work in close quarters as well as far away?
8514600	8515600	Well, how do you play?
8515600	8517600	I can tell you for certain my living room is really small.
8517600	8520060	Well, how do you play Wii Sports and Wii Bowling?
8520060	8522560	Because I know that takes up some space.
8522560	8527480	You know, I know when we're playing Wii Bowling and Wii Sports and stuff like that, we push
8527480	8529440	out the coffee table, move it out of the way.
8529440	8533080	And yeah, I know it's just one of the requirements.
8533080	8534080	You gotta have space.
8534080	8535880	And guys, don't get me wrong.
8535880	8538720	When I say I'm skeptical, that doesn't mean I hate it.
8538720	8541280	I think it's a great idea.
8541280	8548440	If they pull off everything they're promising, I will bow down and suck Xbox's cock, okay?
8548440	8551560	It truly is one of the greatest things I've ever seen in that case.
8551560	8555280	But excuse me if I'm a little bit skeptical.
8555280	8558720	I think I have a right based on some of the crap we've seen before, right?
8558720	8562480	I fully agree.
8562480	8565280	So I'm just cautiously optimistic.
8565280	8567460	Okay, that's fair.
8567460	8569680	Cautiously optimistic.
8569680	8574080	Optimistic to the point of if this ends up being crap, then yes, I'm not gonna buy it.
8574080	8577120	But I need to see it actually being utilized.
8577120	8582440	And I trust that Microsoft would probably understand that, you know what, this isn't
8582440	8584360	gonna be just for the casual gamer.
8584360	8589440	Let's implement this and maybe some other stuff and see what we can do with it.
8589440	8593600	Alright, moving on to some other topics, since we have a lot of ground to cover, I'm sure
8593600	8596560	some of the callers are gonna want to revisit this because probably Natal is the thing that's
8596560	8598160	got the biggest buzz out of E3.
8598160	8603200	I do want to mention this, speaking of buzz, my Twitter has filled up with blah blah blah
8603200	8604920	about 1 versus 100.
8604920	8609840	And I feel completely out of the loop because I have yet to play it because I've not been
8609840	8613440	home when all these beta tests have been going on or what have you.
8613440	8614440	But is there...
8614440	8615440	I don't know why.
8615440	8618320	It's a freaking game show.
8618320	8620780	You know what, if so many people are saying good things about it, there must be something
8620780	8621780	good about it.
8621780	8622780	People are having fun with it.
8622780	8623780	That's what games are supposed to be, fun.
8623780	8624780	They're welcome to it.
8624780	8625780	So, I don't know.
8625780	8626780	Loki, if you had a show...
8626780	8627780	Oh, you know, you just got home today.
8627780	8628780	Of course you haven't tried it.
8628780	8629780	Of course not.
8629780	8630780	Yeah.
8630780	8631780	I definitely want to check it out.
8631780	8632780	It's just I...
8632780	8633780	It's so freaking popular on Twitter.
8633780	8635280	I'm surprised it's not in the trending topic.
8635280	8636560	So many people talk about it.
8636560	8640280	Okay, some of the other things that were mentioned at Microsoft's first conference, Left 4 Dead
8640280	8642160	2.
8642160	8643880	It's got a lot of people pissed off.
8643880	8645940	It looked cool, I thought, to me.
8645940	8649600	When I first saw it, I thought there was this one game that was supposed to be coming out.
8649600	8653560	It was like Voodoo something or other that had Samuel L. Jackson doing the voice of the
8653560	8654560	main character.
8654560	8656920	I thought that's what that was, and then they were all Left 4 Dead 2.
8656920	8660200	I'm like, oh, I guess it could be that too.
8660200	8663360	But a lot of people are just shouting too soon.
8663360	8668220	In fact, there's a petition already with 13,000 people on it, which, you know, petitions
8668220	8672640	online don't really do anything, but, you know, whatever, that are saying it's too soon,
8672640	8676080	that they didn't support the first game enough, and that Valve's cashing in.
8676080	8680880	Honestly, if you ask me, I think that you've been spoiled by Valve, and so now that they
8680880	8685100	actually putting out another game, so what?
8685100	8687600	Don't pick it up if you don't want to pick it up.
8687600	8688600	But you gotta...
8688600	8689600	Wait for it to go on sale.
8689600	8690600	Yeah, wait for it to go on sale.
8690600	8691600	I mean...
8691600	8694060	They always have these crazy ass sales, you know, six months, a year later.
8694060	8697680	No one's forcing you to buy it, but, you know, people are pissed off because they've been
8697680	8705040	spoiled with, you know, all the Team Fortress 2 updates on PC, not on 360, but on PC, and
8705040	8713320	all the other stuff, and whatever, dude, I mean, seriously, just, it's in a different
8713320	8714320	setting, okay?
8714320	8715320	When?
8715320	8716600	I don't know.
8716600	8724000	Different setting, you've got, you know, a little bit different game modes in there.
8724000	8726160	If that's enough free to buy another game, then buy it.
8726160	8727760	If not, then don't.
8727760	8731280	Yeah, but Left 4 Dead has hugely rabid fans in it.
8731280	8732960	I'm sure there's tons of people.
8732960	8734040	This thing's gonna sell like crazy.
8734040	8735280	Rabid indicates disease.
8735280	8738360	Well, okay, I mean, here's their complaints right now.
8738360	8745960	I mean, their complaints, basically, that for one, there is significant content for
8745960	8751560	Left 4 Dead, the original that was promised but never delivered.
8751560	8756080	Valve put little faith in Left 4 Dead 1 since it's almost certainly started working on
8756080	8758440	Left 4 Dead 2 right after release.
8758440	8762520	The fact that Left 4 Dead 2 is nearly identical to Left 4 Dead 1, it will decimate the community
8762520	8764240	of both games.
8764240	8768520	The announced date is not nearly enough time to polish content or make significant gameplay
8768520	8772920	changes, which, all these are really assumptions on the development process, and since none
8772920	8776760	of these people actually work for Valve, then I don't really know where they're actually,
8776760	8780720	you know, how they're able to make these comments actually, you know, with...
8780720	8784280	I seem to recall Left 4 Dead got some pretty awesome support after it came out, like there
8784280	8788040	was a free pack that came out afterwards with some new stuff, you know.
8788040	8789040	I don't know.
8789040	8790160	I think you guys have it pretty good.
8790160	8791160	The new...
8791160	8792160	I repeat myself, wah.
8792160	8795600	Yeah, the new character designs seem bland and unappealing so far.
8795600	8800080	Left 4 Dead 2 is too bright to fit in with Left 4 Dead 1's visual aesthetic.
8800080	8801760	Hey, it's a new game.
8801760	8804320	It can have its own fucking aesthetic, okay?
8804320	8805320	Get over it, shit.
8805320	8809100	You know, just because a Resident Evil game comes out doesn't mean that every single one
8809100	8810100	has to be dark.
8810100	8815200	I do remember Resident Evil 4 taking place, or not 4, 5 taking place in Africa, and guess
8815200	8816200	what?
8816200	8817480	It was bright and cheery, but there's zombies.
8817480	8819480	Did anyone bitch about that?
8819480	8820680	No.
8820680	8825460	The fiddle-based horde music is extremely disliked, though differently orchestrated
8825460	8828160	in music is otherwise welcome.
8828160	8833200	Left 4 Dead 2's release will result in a drop of quality and frequency of Left 4 Dead 1
8833200	8838520	content even compared to before, and the community has lost faith in Valve's former reputation
8838520	8841660	for commitment to their games post release.
8841660	8844600	Waaaaaah is what I hear, because you know what?
8844600	8849940	When I went to Microsoft's booth and EA's booth, guess where the lines were?
8849940	8854720	For Left 4 Dead 2, so go suck it, because enough people out there fucking love that
8854720	8855720	game.
8855720	8856720	At least wait until the game comes out.
8856720	8857720	Exactly.
8857720	8858720	It's way too early to start, bitch.
8858720	8863120	My god, you're going by fucking impressions and some brief gameplay clips and stuff like
8863120	8864120	that.
8864120	8865120	Play it, because you know what?
8865120	8868320	I didn't see a lot of people crying and moaning about playing Left 4 Dead 2.
8868320	8872040	They're playing it and seem to be having enough fun, so just get over yourselves.
8872040	8876760	Seriously, been spoiled by Valve, and now you're fucking just bitching and moaning,
8876760	8877760	but you know what?
8877760	8878760	That's what fanboys do.
8878760	8879760	They bitch and moan, so whatever.
8879760	8880760	That's what we do here on this show.
8880760	8881760	Three hours every Sunday.
8881760	8882760	Exactly.
8882760	8883760	Bitch and moan.
8883760	8884760	Alright.
8884760	8889480	The Halo series has Halo Reach and Halo ODST.
8889480	8892040	Talk about milking a franchise.
8892040	8893040	Holy shit.
8893040	8894360	Oh, Halo's done.
8894360	8896280	Oh, no it's not.
8896280	8900080	We need to put out some more prequels.
8900080	8903840	There won't be a Halo 4, but damn it, we'll think of everything else we can do.
8903840	8906240	ODST looks kind of okay.
8906240	8909760	Gameplay-wise, I don't know what they're really going to do different than Halo 3, and just
8909760	8912440	to make sure that you're a sucker and buy ODST.
8912440	8916160	They're throwing in a bunch of freebies, and they're also going to throw in a beta to Halo
8916160	8919920	Reach, which we don't even know what the hell it is yet, other than it's going to be like
8919920	8922520	another prequel.
8922520	8924640	Awesome.
8924640	8926360	Not interested in it one bit.
8926360	8929800	Oh, and they're going to have a collector's edition, as they have to do with every Halo
8929800	8932840	game, and they're going to include another Xbox 360 controller.
8932840	8933840	Cat helmet?
8933840	8937200	No, just an Xbox 360 controller that has special painting on it.
8937200	8938200	Wow, are you a-
8938200	8939200	Does it have a functional D-pad?
8939200	8943760	No, but it's camo.
8943760	8948520	Brad from Pod Culture in chat comments, ODST has Nathan Fillion.
8948520	8949520	Ooh.
8949520	8957360	Oh, well then that's perfect for all those fanboys out there who love Nathan Fillion.
8957360	8958360	Crackdown 2.
8958360	8961960	Okay, this is the only game I actually was really excited about hearing about it, because
8961960	8967480	I love me some Crackdown, and I hope that god, there's no Halo Reach beta in this too,
8967480	8968480	so-
8968480	8971520	Didn't they say- oh no, the Reach beta's an ODST, I think.
8971520	8976040	I know, but it doesn't mean they can't put another Reach beta into this, but yeah, it's
8976040	8977040	going to be cool.
8977040	8979800	They're going to expand the co-op in it to 4 players, which I think it should have had
8979800	8982880	in the first place, and they're also going to have 16 player deathmatch in it, which
8982880	8983880	is awesome.
8983880	8986040	How about Shadow Complex?
8986040	8989640	This is the one that Cliffy B came out, and y'all think it's going to be Gears of War
8989640	8993920	3, but nope, it's a game called Shadow Complex, which is an Xbox Live arcade game, kind of
8993920	8996480	looks like Bionic Commando Rearmed.
8996480	9003040	I think it was supposed to be more like Castlevania and Metroid, is kind of what they were comparing
9003040	9006040	it to, and it looked neat.
9006040	9012000	I don't know if it's going to be a game I'm going to want.
9012000	9016080	They were saying the rumor right now is that it's not going to be priced less than $20.
9016080	9017080	Yikes.
9017080	9020880	But anyway, it looks like it has quite a bit of polish to it.
9020880	9023880	I didn't actually get to play it, but it looks neat.
9023880	9028560	I mean, I'm glad to see he's not working on Gears of War 3, because really, come on, that
9028560	9030680	would be just a broken record right there.
9030680	9031680	What else?
9031680	9035840	Forza 3, you've kind of mentioned a few times throughout the show, looked pretty neat.
9035840	9042720	Pretty much like all the rumors were back in that one survey that they had going around.
9042720	9047660	Two Disc, I think they said 250 cars.
9047660	9053560	Really cool stuff, actually 400 manufacturers in there.
9053560	9056200	They were going to have the ability to upload high def video.
9056200	9059240	They actually have a video editor in there, which looked pretty sweet.
9059240	9064160	Not really my cup of tea, but it's a neat feature, and then also kind of including the
9064160	9068440	same stuff that they had in Forza 2, with all the designing cars, they kind of spent
9068440	9073440	a little bit much, a lot of time on the whole designing cars thing, like, it was a way for
9073440	9076200	me to express myself and stuff like that.
9076200	9085040	That was a little bit, I don't know, ridiculous, if you ask me, because, dude, just, I don't
9085040	9088120	know, draw something on paper or something.
9088120	9091740	I don't know, seriously, there's other ways to express yourself, not this game.
9091740	9094580	This game didn't just come out and go, oh my god, now I can actually express myself
9094580	9096040	for the first time.
9096040	9098760	I express myself through playing The Sims.
9098760	9103940	Well, maybe you can upload some of these high def videos and pictures to the brand new Facebook
9103940	9105760	integration on Xbox Live.
9105760	9106760	Yeah.
9106760	9107760	But wait, wait, it doesn't stop there.
9107760	9108760	It doesn't stop there.
9108760	9111020	Twitter on Xbox Live as well.
9111020	9112800	The Facebook thing actually looked kind of cool.
9112800	9116320	The only reason it looked cool is because you can actually, upcoming games are going
9116320	9119000	to support this in-game screenshot thing.
9119000	9120360	That's kind of neat.
9120360	9122520	That's kind of neat.
9122520	9124520	I don't know about Facebook and Twitter.
9124520	9129000	I don't use Twitter that much, and Facebook I really don't use that much.
9129000	9134960	It'll be neat, and I'm glad that they're adding more things, but, web browser, please, just
9134960	9136720	add a web browser.
9136720	9137720	Don't need all these things.
9137720	9138720	Just add a web browser.
9138720	9139720	Guess what?
9139720	9144640	I can go to Facebook.com, or I can go to Twitter.com and add tweets that way.
9144640	9147900	I have Facebook on my iPhone, so I don't need anything else.
9147900	9150320	Add a web browser.
9150320	9155200	And not just that, Last.fm was another integration they announced that's going to be there.
9155200	9156200	That's pretty cool.
9156200	9160760	So that you'll be able to, I guess, stream the Last.fm radio, I'm assuming, to the Xbox
9160760	9161760	360.
9161760	9163320	I kind of took that assumption.
9163320	9165600	Or it's going to track your plays from the 360.
9165600	9169680	I'm not sure exactly how that's working.
9169680	9172120	I don't really use Last.fm.
9172120	9177280	So exactly what kind of stations are we talking, like music hosted on servers, and we can stream
9177280	9178680	stations based on artists?
9178680	9179680	Well, here's the thing.
9179680	9185240	On Last.fm, it basically tracks everything you play using a Scrobbler, everything that
9185240	9186240	you play.
9186240	9190200	So what you can do, once you've tracked some of your listening things, what it will do
9190200	9192900	is it will actually develop a station that's your station.
9192900	9197060	So any artist that has released the permission for their songs to stream, essentially, any
9197060	9201400	of your songs that are released, you can have a station that's just your music that you
9201400	9203280	can access from basically anywhere.
9203280	9208040	The iPhone app, I am assuming the 360 in the future, or what have you.
9208040	9210680	But also, you can do music you might like.
9210680	9213840	If you like this, then you'd probably like this type of music.
9213840	9218200	Because obviously, it's trending what you listen to and what other people listen to.
9218200	9221760	Funny enough, if you listen to podcasts on iTunes, they get Scrobbled.
9221760	9226200	So yeah, there's an entry for Orange Launch Radio on Last.fm, because people listen to
9226200	9228660	our show, and so it goes into there.
9228660	9233720	But I wouldn't think that this integration is going to mean that the podcasts are suddenly
9233720	9234720	going to be listening.
9234720	9236180	I don't think it's going to do anything for us.
9236180	9238400	But yeah, podcasts are a small part of Last.fm.
9238400	9239400	Very small.
9239400	9240400	Neat.
9240400	9241400	I know.
9241400	9243700	It could be interesting.
9243700	9245280	I'm not sure.
9245280	9246960	We need to hear more about it.
9246960	9249120	But that was kind of a surprise.
9249120	9251040	Some of the other things that they talked about at the press conference.
9251040	9254400	Final Fantasy XIII actually running on the Xbox 360.
9254400	9255400	Which looked fine.
9255400	9256800	Big deal looked like the PlayStation 3 one.
9256800	9258000	I mean, not a big surprise there.
9258000	9260720	Which we all knew it kind of should.
9260720	9262940	Metal Gear Solid rising.
9262940	9263940	Not four.
9263940	9264940	Rising.
9264940	9268560	And Metal Gear Solid was coming out.
9268560	9269560	We already knew that.
9269560	9271260	It wasn't a big surprise.
9271260	9275240	But boy, when Kojima walked out on that stage, I bet there were a lot of people thinking,
9275240	9276240	here it is.
9276240	9277240	Here it is.
9277240	9279920	Yeah, they were thinking, oh.
9279920	9281800	And I love the way they worded it.
9281800	9285880	Now the Metal Gear franchise has come to the 360.
9285880	9288800	And they made it sound like it was exclusive.
9288800	9289800	But it's not.
9289800	9290800	No.
9290800	9291800	No.
9291800	9294800	Metal Gear Solid rising is not.
9294800	9296400	I think this just cements.
9296400	9298240	And I better not hear it ever again.
9298240	9301640	Metal Gear Solid 4 is not coming to the 360.
9301640	9304740	If it was, you would have heard it this year at E3.
9304740	9305740	It is done.
9305740	9306740	They have moved on.
9306740	9310560	This is how they're getting Metal Gear Solid on the 360 is moving forward.
9310560	9315400	There is a new Metal Gear Solid PlayStation Network and live game that's coming out.
9315400	9317080	Just using the Metal Gear Solid 4 engine.
9317080	9318080	Oh, neat.
9318080	9319080	What game is that?
9319080	9323040	I don't remember what it's called, but I remember hearing about it.
9323040	9324920	Maybe that's that Metal Gear Solid arcade.
9324920	9326120	That's probably what that is.
9326120	9331840	I was thinking an arcade game, but it's actually for Xbox Live Arcade.
9331840	9334400	So that's kind of neat.
9334400	9337120	There you go, Metal Gear Solid 4 on the 360.
9337120	9338120	Couple other games.
9338120	9339120	Modern Warfare 2.
9339120	9341400	I don't know if you are into this, Loki.
9341400	9342400	No.
9342400	9343400	Not my thing.
9343400	9346640	Yeah, again, this kind of falls in the category of, hey, it looks neat for the people that
9346640	9350360	are into that sort of game, but I can't play everything.
9350360	9351420	Alan Wake.
9351420	9352760	Let's close with Alan Wake.
9352760	9354920	What did you think of this one?
9354920	9357080	It's nice to actually see the game being played.
9357080	9358400	A little weird.
9358400	9359400	I don't know.
9359400	9360400	The whole light-dark thing is kind of neat.
9360400	9361400	Mine is a WiiWare game.
9361400	9365840	Yeah, I wanted to know about that one because I wasn't sure on it.
9365840	9369880	Well, here's a little trailer I can actually play here, except there's a lot to this.
9369880	9370880	It's a very lengthy trailer.
9370880	9375200	I came to the small town of Bright Falls on vacation with my wife, Alice.
9375200	9376200	Now she's missing.
9376200	9378200	Let me see if I can skip ahead a little.
9378200	9379200	It's my fault.
9379200	9380720	I'll actually try to show some of the...
9380720	9386560	Yeah, I don't like the previously on Alan Wake because it reminds me of Alone in the
9386560	9387560	Dark.
9387560	9388560	Alone in the Dark.
9388560	9393000	No one should have to remember that.
9393000	9394000	I don't know.
9394000	9396680	It looks like in the cutscenes a little bit silent and hilly, but I don't think that's
9396680	9398000	how the game actually plays.
9398000	9400640	There, you can see some of the game in motion there.
9400640	9402640	That's something that made me motion sick.
9402640	9403640	Maybe.
9403640	9404640	It looks kind of neat.
9404640	9408640	It's about these evil things that are invisible and then shine the light on people.
9408640	9413440	Kind of like the Brian and Karen, you attack them and I don't know.
9413440	9421040	What was that movie where the guy had the sunglasses and you could see aliens that way?
9421040	9423040	Is it like that?
9423040	9424040	It's black?
9424040	9426080	No, They Live or something.
9426080	9430640	It had Rowdy Roddy Piper in it.
9430640	9433120	X Lincoln Chat says, it looks like Silent Hill meets Supernatural.
9433120	9434840	That would be like Jamie's dream game.
9434840	9437400	Yeah, that would really be my dream game.
9437400	9440960	I think I would have to check this one out after all.
9440960	9441960	All right.
9441960	9443520	Loki, what did you want to add?
9443520	9447880	I was going to add, there was one thing that didn't get announced at, actually a few things
9447880	9449960	that they announced and touched on.
9449960	9454380	One, some new enhancements to Netflix.
9454380	9460380	They add, now you're going to be able to actually add stuff to your streaming queue straight
9460380	9461920	from the 360.
9461920	9465120	Not having to go back to your PC, which is kind of cool.
9465120	9468240	And you'll be able to also browse through different categories on there.
9468240	9474240	They're also doing some additions to the video store on there where you can do instant streaming
9474240	9475240	stuff.
9475240	9476240	So that's kind of weird.
9476240	9480640	That's actually going to be able to, no buffering whatsoever, it's just going to stream, which
9480640	9484720	I told that to some of my people at work and they're very skeptical on that.
9484720	9490880	And also it's going to be upgraded to 1080p instead of just 720p.
9490880	9496880	Of course the Xbox video marketplace is being relaunched at the Zune video this fall to
9496880	9501880	kind of integrate it with their Zune HD stuff, which did not come up at the conference at
9501880	9504240	all.
9504240	9511200	And then also this one was a really big surprise, it didn't come up at the conference at all.
9511200	9517960	You're going to be able to download full Xbox 360 games starting in August on their service.
9517960	9523600	And you're going to be able to basically buy brand new games including Mass Effect, Assassin's
9523600	9527080	Creed, Civilization Revolution.
9527080	9530880	You can use Microsoft points or actually use a credit card to buy these games.
9530880	9534720	And they're full retail games that do not require a disk at all and they'll store it
9534720	9535760	on your hard drive.
9535760	9537600	That just sounds a bit bizarre.
9537600	9543320	Yeah, kind of interesting, the whole digital distribution thing, huh?
9543320	9546720	Just like full?
9546720	9548040	The whole damn game.
9548040	9551240	That's pretty crazy.
9551240	9555040	All right, so that pretty much wraps it up for everything I wanted to say about the press
9555040	9556040	conferences.
9556040	9559800	DarkSucker, I know you had a few stories you wanted to talk about tonight that weren't
9559800	9563040	really necessarily tied in completely to E3, do we want to get to those?
9563040	9567540	But some of it was touched on a bit, let me pull up.
9567540	9570280	And then I'm going to probably just turn it back to Loki, see if there's anything else
9570280	9573000	he wants to mention about E3.
9573000	9577480	But we need to cover release dates at some point too, don't we?
9577480	9581440	So we'll cover release dates as well and get into those.
9581440	9585280	I unfortunately accidentally closed my release date page, so let me get back to it.
9585280	9588280	We are going to go to the Skype line tonight, but since we anticipate there's going to be
9588280	9591760	a lot of calls tonight, we're going to institute our two-minute rule tonight, which means no
9591760	9593600	call is going to go longer than two minutes.
9593600	9596760	We're going to be asking everyone the same questions, who are you and what did you think
9596760	9597760	of E3?
9597760	9600300	So we'll give everyone their two minutes, but since we want to get through a lot of
9600300	9604160	calls tonight, just so you know, that's going to be the rule tonight.
9604160	9607200	I know that might be sad, but at the same time, that means we get more people on the
9607200	9608200	phone and that's happy.
9608200	9609200	Alright, there we go.
9609200	9610200	Be happy.
9610200	9611200	Yeah, start talking.
9611200	9617680	Alright, what we have is, for the 10th, this is UK releases by the way, we have Drakonika
9617680	9624200	on PC, and then on the 12th we have EA Sports Grand Challenge Tennis, Indiana Jones and
9624200	9634480	Staff of Kings on a bunch of systems, Prototype on PC, PS3, Xbox 360, and that's it.
9634480	9637480	Going over to Japan, you might have heard me mention last week, there really is not
9637480	9642080	a lot to look forward to in Japan this month, it's a very slow release over in Japan, and
9642080	9643560	that continues to be true this week.
9643560	9649460	There really isn't anything out on the Xbox 360 or the Playstation 3, although a big game
9649460	9653420	is getting a price drop next week, I'll have to tell you about that next week, but going
9653420	9659480	to some of the other systems, again, going to Japan, on the Playstation 2, again, nothing,
9659480	9663520	there is literally nothing coming out in Japan this week, let me see if the DS is any different.
9663520	9670900	Okay, on the DS you get Infinite Space is a new game from Sega coming out, that comes
9670900	9673800	out this week, that is really the only big release on the DS.
9673800	9676180	That's the new Platinum Games game.
9676180	9677180	Is it really?
9677180	9678180	Yeah.
9678180	9682760	Trying to see if there's anything on the Wii to mention this week, Chibi-Robo, the Wii
9682760	9687960	version comes out in Japan this week, as well as Metroid Prime 2 with Wii controls, but
9687960	9692480	of course, as you know, it's coming out here in the US pretty soon, as a combined one,
9692480	9699440	and then quickly looking at the PSP for Japanese release dates, I really don't think there's
9699440	9703320	anything this week either, oh no, I take that back, of course there's another Neon Genesis
9703320	9708040	Evangelion game, Kotsetsu no Girlfriend 2nd Portable, limited edition.
9708040	9716240	Oh, they're doing, I've played that game too, the Girlfriend of Steel.
9716240	9722640	Fate Unlimited, Kodes Portable is now coming to the PSP in Japan this week, it's a PS2
9722640	9726680	game that's been ported, a 3D fight for the Holy Grail.
9726680	9728480	That's it for Japanese releases.
9728480	9733320	In the US there wasn't a whole lot this, or coming a week here, but today we had Legendary
9733320	9738240	photography, it's a 2D platforming franchise from Nintendo that's finally made its way
9738240	9741100	over to the United States.
9741100	9747480	Also next week we'll be getting Tiger Woods PGA Tour 2010 on all platforms, a lot more
9747480	9751720	games you're gonna see coming out supporting Wii Motion Plus, since that's also coming
9751720	9757960	out on the 9th, including EA's Grand Slam Tennis, of course there's also the Tiger Woods
9757960	9761520	PGA Tour Wii bundle with Wii Motion Plus.
9761520	9767840	And then finally also coming out that, I think there's one other Wii Motion Plus game, oh
9767840	9768840	yes!
9768840	9773320	Virtua Tennis 2009 on Playstation 3, Xbox 360, and the Wii.
9773320	9778880	And then other games other than Wii Motion Plus stuff, Prototype coming out on PS3 and
9778880	9782080	Xbox 360 and then Blue PC.
9782080	9792800	And also we've got some really crappy games, Diva Girls, Divas on Ice on the DS, and I
9792800	9800600	think on the Wii, Indiana Jones and the Staff of Kings on Playstation 2, the Wii, the PSP,
9800600	9807360	and I believe the DS, Vertigo, which is a marble blast type of game, that's gonna be
9807360	9811400	coming out on the Wii, it's a budget title.
9811400	9817880	Also this week, Rock Band Unplugged coming out on PSP, and also the bundle to go along
9817880	9818880	with that.
9818880	9822880	And back to crappy games, Pets Fashion, Dogs and Cats, yes a game where you can dress up
9822880	9826420	both dogs and cats to look absolutely ridiculous.
9826420	9831440	And on the Wii we have Go Play Lumberjacks, Lumberjack themed games, and Go Play Circus
9831440	9832440	Star.
9832440	9834960	I'm a Lumberjack and I don't care.
9834960	9836760	Seriously.
9836760	9844840	And then, let's see here, oh and then how could I forget, Guitar Hero On Tour, Modern
9844840	9854360	Hits, the third DS game, not supporting the, you know, DSi, Pool Hall Pro, another budget
9854360	9859280	Wii billiards game, and then finally on the DS, Lego Battles, the real time strategy game
9859280	9860280	for DS.
9860280	9861280	Alright.
9861280	9862280	Sounds fascinating.
9862280	9867720	Uh, DarkSocker, I don't know if you had anything else you wanted to mention.
9867720	9871120	Um, yeah, actually yes I did, because it's about Tekken.
9871120	9872120	Go for it.
9872120	9873120	And I love Tekken.
9873120	9875520	And Loki, we'll go to you with any other E3 things you want to report on.
9875520	9880600	Um, actually it's just a report from E3 about Tekken 6, it has a beat em up mode.
9880600	9883040	You can go around beating stuff up.
9883040	9889960	Stomp em, smash em, and it has a story with it, and you can use guns and have giant robots.
9889960	9890960	Well hooray for giant robots.
9890960	9893840	Is that like the whole, like, Tekken 3 had it's beat em up mode in it?
9893840	9900360	That's what I think, that's how I, um, but I mean, I think it's gonna be fun, I mean
9900360	9902960	at least it's not like the crazy RPG mode.
9902960	9903960	True.
9903960	9908280	But I love, I love to meet some Tekken.
9908280	9914760	Um, alright, and some other things that were kind of E3 related, uh, another part of the
9914760	9919200	Microsoft press conference that they talked about, uh, the new game from Big Park, um,
9919200	9925200	Joyride, it's a free to download, kart racing game, however free to download, but there
9925200	9930560	will be additional download content that will cost money that, um, basically all these different
9930560	9934440	micro, micro, uh, transactions involved with the game.
9934440	9937760	But it is free to download, so free is always good, and at least you can check it out that
9937760	9938760	way.
9938760	9940160	It's like, just like a Korean MMO.
9940160	9941160	Exactly.
9941160	9946040	So, um, that'll be coming soon from Microsoft, and in fact, to kind of go along with all
9946040	9953080	that stuff, um, Microsoft has announced their new Summer of Arcade, and with that, a bunch
9953080	9958240	of games coming out, including Splosion Man, which I believe they had a trailer for a while
9958240	9964600	ago, which looked kind of cool, the, uh, game from Epic Shadow Complex, TMNT Turtles in
9964600	9967640	Time Reshelled, the remake of Turtles in Time.
9967640	9968640	That's happy, happy, happy.
9968640	9969640	Yes, please.
9969640	9974480	Uh, the HD port of Marvel vs. Capcom 2, coming.
9974480	9975480	Nice.
9975480	9982040	Trials HD, which is based off of a Steam game, uh, Trials 2, 2nd edition, um, that's gonna
9982040	9988320	be coming out, and also, to go along with, um, the more, you know, telltale games, adventure
9988320	9994720	games, Monkey Island Special Edition, coming out with, uh, both, uh, remixed and original
9994720	9995720	graphics.
9995720	9997880	Oh, that was a huge thing announced at E3.
9997880	10000600	And who, who played, who played Monkey Island?
10000600	10002040	I played Monkey Island.
10002040	10005920	That was a huge PC game, uh, the LucasArts series.
10005920	10010720	Well, I mean, I just wanted to know if either of you guys actually played it, because I
10010720	10012000	actually didn't.
10012000	10015480	I didn't play that one, but I played Loom and some of the other ones that LucasArts
10015480	10016480	played.
10016480	10017480	Well, Loom, Loom, hell yeah, I love Loom.
10017480	10018480	Yeah.
10018480	10022880	I love me some Michael, er, uh, Monkey Island there, and I also, um, something else that
10022880	10027640	made me kind of, uh, happy, is not only are they really seeing the original Monkey Island
10027640	10034280	and the remixed version, but Telltale is working on episodic Monkey Island games that are going
10034280	10040160	to be coming to all the platforms that normally receive the Monkey Island games, including,
10040160	10044800	um, I believe Xbox Live, uh, PC and WiiWare.
10044800	10049880	I think they only announced PC and WiiWare right now for the, uh, Monkey Island stuff,
10049880	10052800	but I can only assume that it's coming to the other platforms, probably PlayStation
10052800	10054420	Network as well.
10054420	10056080	So that's really cool.
10056080	10060200	Um, avatars are going to get some interesting stuff.
10060200	10064920	You're going to be able to get unlockable clothing and, um, props for avatars based
10064920	10068640	on achievements, and they were showing off some of the ones for ODST, which unlocks a
10068640	10073120	costume for your character, so that's kind of cool that they're utilizing them in that
10073120	10074120	sense.
10074120	10076600	That's kind of cool.
10076600	10080040	And yet still no trophy cabinets in home, although I will say I did play home this week,
10080040	10084240	and they are slowly making upgrades to what we all thought home was going to be a year
10084240	10085240	ago.
10085240	10087960	So, yeah, you can finally put pictures in home.
10087960	10089800	You can import pictures in your home.
10089800	10090800	That's special.
10090800	10096400	Um, some other stuff, um, going back to Microsoft again, um, some features they were talking
10096400	10100240	about when they originally were showing off the new Xbox experience.
10100240	10104200	Now you will be able to watch movies with your friends and also do the photo slideshows
10104200	10105200	and stuff like that with your friends.
10105200	10108400	I think you can actually already do the photo slideshows now, but you'll be able to listen
10108400	10113400	to the music and stuff with your friends, so a feature that they showed off originally,
10113400	10116920	you're actually going to be able to do it now, for the UK, um, audience, you're getting
10116920	10121600	Sky TV, so you'll be able to watch, um, sporting events and stuff like that, which is kind
10121600	10124200	of cool, um, with your friends.
10124200	10132540	And then, um, let's see here, also, uh, some other random stuff, um, Xbox Live Arcade on
10132540	10137680	June 17th will be getting Magic the Gathering as their downloadable title.
10137680	10145160	Magic the Gathering, uh, Duels of Planeswalker, um, will be coming out, so, um, if you're
10145160	10147960	a Magic fan, that's probably pretty exciting news.
10147960	10154620	Um, on the Wii, actually, WiiWare in Japan is getting a new four player Pokemon fighting
10154620	10159480	game that's coming, um, out on June 16th.
10159480	10163160	No word on exactly how that's going to play, but, uh, it says, it looks like gameplay is
10163160	10169560	real time, like Zelda or, um, Ys type action RPG, and, of course, four players can face
10169560	10179480	off in the game's Battle Royale arena mode, huh, interesting, um, let's see here, uh,
10179480	10184400	Team Ico, remember, I think we talked a little bit, um, last week that they were teasing
10184400	10189920	that, um, there's going to be some Ico download content for, uh, LittleBigPlanet.
10189920	10193280	Did they say what it is?
10193280	10201400	Actually they have, um, they have some more teaser stuff to go along with it, but, apparently,
10201400	10206040	it looks like it might actually be a level pack, like, uh, the Metal Gear Solid stuff.
10206040	10208760	Sweet, I love the Metal Gear Solid level pack.
10208760	10215720	Yeah, so, um, they have some stuff from Media Monocle, it's on their website, um, doesn't
10215720	10221160	really show, it says it's, uh, Shadow Colossus stuff, I guess, is what it's supposed to be,
10221160	10226280	um, they don't really, it's just, like, kind of teaser stuff right now, I'm trying to pull
10226280	10233900	up their videos, see if it actually shows, haha, I don't know, but it looks like it's
10233900	10237480	just going to be Shadow Colossus stuff, I don't know if it's actually levels or stuff,
10237480	10243520	but, um, it's at least going to be stickers and costumes, so that's kind of neat, and
10243520	10250160	they have, like, a Colossus, um, costume and stuff, uh, Tatsunoko vs. Capcom was shown
10250160	10253840	at E3 this year, and they've announced that there's going to be five new characters for
10253840	10256440	North America, since they've removed one.
10256440	10258400	And they're taking out the Genie character.
10258400	10265200	So, uh, that'll be kind of cool, uh, Perfect Dark, being remade for Xbox Live Arcade, we
10265200	10269240	kind of knew that because of all the leaked icons and images and stuff like that, but
10269240	10275360	it has been confirmed now, it's actually being, um, redone, um, or kind of, uh, updated, I
10275360	10281120	guess, to run in 1080p, and it'll be coming out this fall on Xbox Live Arcade.
10281120	10290720	Um, let's see here, some other stuff, like, they were showing off this game called, uh,
10290720	10295200	Cop, the Recruit, uh, for the DS, it actually looked pretty cool, it actually looked like
10295200	10300720	kind of the PSP Grand Theft Auto games, that's coming out from Ubisoft, uh, I think later
10300720	10301720	this year.
10301720	10303720	So that'll look kind of cool.
10303720	10304720	Um...
10304720	10312040	Why don't we take some calls real quick, a little bit of Skypline, because, yeah, we're
10312040	10315560	already running into about three hours worth of show, it's about 930 here on the west coast,
10315560	10318600	very late on the east coast, so I'm gonna go ahead and open up the Skypline tonight,
10318600	10321360	try to get some calls out of the way, and then we'll see if Loki has anything else he
10321360	10322360	wants to bring up.
10322360	10326720	And if you guys want to share your E3 stories, so we can wrap up and get out of here tonight,
10326720	10329000	try to get done before 10 o'clock tonight, so...
10329000	10330000	Oh, come on!
10330000	10333680	I know, but I kind of have to work really early tomorrow, so we're gonna start taking
10333680	10335680	some calls, remember, two-minute rules in effect tonight.
10335680	10337960	Hi, Aaron Orange, Orange Radio, who's this?
10337960	10341240	Hey, this is DS Master 26.
10341240	10343080	I'm sorry, was that DS Master 26?
10343080	10344080	Yes.
10344080	10345680	Alright, what's on your mind?
10345680	10348280	Tell us about your E3 thoughts.
10348280	10354480	Well, I watched it online, and of course, I also watched the Sony conference, the Microsoft
10354480	10361920	and Nintendo ones blew me away, but Sony, boring.
10361920	10365880	The biggest disappointment was, okay, you know how they had Chewbacca come out with
10365880	10369160	the PSP 2000 Star Wars pack, right?
10369160	10370160	Right.
10370160	10376680	I can't believe how they did not schedule Miley Cyrus, aka Hannah Montana, to bring
10376680	10378240	out the Hannah bundle.
10378240	10383880	Seeing as that it got such a huge reception, yeah, but what was it that impressed you more
10383880	10388080	with Microsoft and Nintendo that Sony wasn't delivering on?
10388080	10397520	Like, they showed actual gameplay for Final Fantasy XIII, they showed off, you know, a
10397520	10405040	few songs from Beatles Rock Band, which that was actually kind of awesome, and the Nintendo
10405040	10410280	conference was actually really kind of cool when they showed off the other M, Metroid.
10410280	10413440	So I'm like, this is freaking awesome.
10413440	10416640	Was there more than just the Metroid that you enjoyed at a Nintendo's press conference?
10416640	10424520	Um, that was pretty much, well, other than the Resident Evil stuff, but yeah, and cop.
10424520	10434040	Because I'm like, come on, Rockstar, if Ubisoft can pull off full 3D sandbox games for DS,
10434040	10435400	it's similar to GTA.
10435400	10436400	Why can't you?
10436400	10437400	You know?
10437400	10439200	Alright, 20 seconds left.
10439200	10442080	Any other thoughts about E3 you want to share?
10442080	10449680	Basically, what I was talking about before my PSP went wonky, if Rock Band's dealing
10449680	10454240	with a Lego, I'm betting you a full line, somewhere down the line, Guitar Hero's gonna
10454240	10455720	pick up on Disney.
10455720	10457480	It's bound to happen.
10457480	10458480	We'll see what happens.
10458480	10459480	Alright, time's up.
10459480	10460480	Batav, good one.
10460480	10461480	Thanks for calling in.
10461480	10462480	Alright, peace out.
10462480	10463480	Later.
10463480	10467040	Uh, 1-877-GAME-OLR, our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.
10467040	10468960	Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio.
10468960	10469960	Who's this?
10469960	10471680	Hey, yo, what's up?
10471680	10472680	It's Foodie Monster.
10472680	10474400	Well, long time no see, Foodie Monster.
10474400	10475400	How you doing?
10475400	10476400	How you doing, guys?
10476400	10477400	I'm doing fine.
10477400	10481880	I actually moved countries, which is why I've been kind of able, or something, MIA and stuff.
10481880	10482880	Where are you now?
10482880	10483880	Oh, yeah.
10483880	10484880	I'm in Chile, actually.
10484880	10485880	Well, congratulations on the move.
10485880	10488520	Alright, so tell us E3 thoughts, quickly.
10488520	10491800	Okay, well, I actually wrote it down, so I make it faster for you guys.
10491800	10492800	Let's see.
10492800	10496560	Splinter Cell Conviction, oh my god, I look incredible, and I'm so happy with the direction
10496560	10498560	they're taking that game.
10498560	10500200	Assassin's Creed 2, love the first one.
10500200	10504040	They promised to give us more diversity, and that's exactly what I wanted.
10504040	10508000	Project Natal, kind of fucking wait, day one purchase, for sure.
10508000	10510200	Scribblenauts, amazing.
10510200	10513440	God versus cracking, I mean, really, that's all you need.
10513440	10518280	PSP, excited about Sony, because they're really proving that they can support the platform
10518280	10519600	this way.
10519600	10524080	They're showing more stuff, more games to the little planet, a lot of things, RPGs,
10524080	10526600	and I'm really excited about that.
10526600	10530640	Definitely interested about The Last Guardian, that might actually get me to buy a PS3, because
10530640	10532480	that looks great.
10532480	10537460	And definitely my best of E3 thing, the best thing that happened in E3, Secret of Monkey
10537460	10542280	Island Special Edition, and Telltale's version of Tales from Monkey Island, which is going
10542280	10544840	to be the best thing since sliced bread.
10544840	10547480	There are a lot of people very, very excited about that thing.
10547480	10551480	With the time left, it's funny, because The Last Caller didn't really like what Sony had
10551480	10556040	to say, but it sounds like you are very excited about what Sony had to say.
10556040	10558240	You weren't turned off by the PSP's price point.
10558240	10562840	Well, the thing is I already own a PSP, I'm not planning on buying another PSP.
10562840	10567120	But I like the design, but if I were to make the jump and buy that one, I would have to
10567120	10571120	wait until it gets to under 200 bucks, because 250 is a little bit too steep.
10571120	10572920	All right, we've got 20 seconds left.
10572920	10575520	Any other last thoughts you want to share with the listeners?
10575520	10579880	Yeah, actually I just want to say to all non-believers, upon I click adventures, fuck you, they're
10579880	10580880	back.
10580880	10581880	Oh yeah.
10581880	10582880	All right.
10582880	10583880	Well, Woody, thanks for the call.
10583880	10584880	It's a pleasure as always.
10584880	10585880	Call back again when we have more time, okay?
10585880	10586880	Will do.
10586880	10587880	See you guys.
10587880	10588880	All right.
10588880	10589880	Later.
10589880	10590880	1877 Game OLR.
10590880	10591880	His name on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.
10591880	10592880	Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio.
10592880	10593880	Who's this?
10593880	10594880	This is Spazinator.
10594880	10595880	Hey, Spazinator.
10595880	10596880	You've got two minutes, E3 thoughts.
10596880	10597880	Go.
10597880	10608360	Yeah, I was impressed by both Microsoft and Sony's conferences.
10608360	10617640	There's too much stuff to really list out, but both the Natal and the Sony motion controller
10617640	10618640	do look promising.
10618640	10622640	I can't see whether they're going to be good or not.
10622640	10630000	I'm also kind of excited about the Final Fantasy release stuff, too.
10630000	10634320	What do you think, since you're really excited about the motion control, how do you think
10634320	10639480	Nintendo can catch up, or do they need to?
10639480	10643600	I honestly don't know.
10643600	10654920	I really haven't been following Nintendo at all for the past 10 years, so I really don't
10654920	10659560	know enough about the Wii to really comment on that.
10659560	10663520	Well, is there any other E3 thoughts you want to comment on tonight, then?
10663520	10665360	No, that's it.
10665360	10667560	Thanks for taking my call.
10667560	10668560	Not a problem.
10668560	10669560	Take care, Spazinator.
10669560	10670560	Have a good one.
10670560	10671560	Yes, you too.
10671560	10672560	Later.
10672560	10676600	Our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.
10676600	10680760	If you want to give us a call, please make sure if you do use Skype, you want to test
10680760	10685920	with Echo 1, 2, 3 first before you call, or else your call might sound like crap, and
10685920	10687640	we don't want to have that now, do we?
10687640	10689120	Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio.
10689120	10690120	Who's this?
10690120	10693480	Hey, it's me, Legend of Zaku.
10693480	10695200	Hey, Legend of Zaku.
10695200	10696200	Two minutes.
10696200	10698580	What do you think of E3?
10698580	10703600	Pretty much, initially, it looks like Microsoft took it, but then again, Sony actually came
10703600	10713920	out and tried very, very close to top them, but Nintendo pretty much came in like third.
10713920	10719200	At least it was better than last year's Nintendo Presser, since that was a downer at best.
10719200	10725600	But yeah, I just hope that Project Natal actually pulls through, it's actually the real thing,
10725600	10730320	because Sony's already demonstrated something tangible in terms of what they're working
10730320	10732980	on.
10732980	10735640	Do you think that Sony might go back to the drawing board, because you were the one in
10735640	10736640	chat that spoke up.
10736640	10737640	It was just a prototype.
10737640	10738640	Yeah, I mean, think about it.
10738640	10742560	They just wanted to get a feeler this week, I mean, last week, when they showed it off
10742560	10747760	at E3, just to gauge what kind of reaction they would get, and then they would incorporate
10747760	10755340	any sort of feedback or anything that they may have not thought of into the development
10755340	10759480	process while they still can, because they still got like, what, at least less than a
10759480	10763000	year before they even release it.
10763000	10766560	So they should have plenty of time to work out any final kicks before they market this
10766560	10767560	thing.
10767560	10770840	No one's answered this question yet, and you've got about 40 seconds left.
10770840	10775280	Who do you think's going to be the first one out there, Microsoft or Sony?
10775280	10780060	Yeah, and this is the issue with first to market.
10780060	10784160	It all depends on whether Sony can outdo Microsoft.
10784160	10791360	In other words, if Natal is going to get sidelined and delayed, then that works in Sony's favor.
10791360	10795920	And then we'll see how, you know, we'll see that Natal is nothing more than a crock of
10795920	10799680	a hyped up, hyped up shit.
10799680	10804360	Quickly, do you think anyone might rush this and screw up?
10804360	10805360	It depends.
10805360	10810740	I think Sony has done a lot to the point where, you know, they could rush this, but they should
10810740	10812600	have a decent product.
10812600	10818240	I'm more worried about Microsoft, because we have yet to see the, we haven't even seen
10818240	10823080	the real, you know, the real thing, and see the real unit on E3.
10823080	10829520	You only just saw pictures of it and just trailers and demos that didn't even use the
10829520	10830520	unit itself.
10830520	10831520	All right, buddy.
10831520	10832520	I got to let you go.
10832520	10833520	Time's up, but thanks for sharing your thoughts.
10833520	10834520	Have a good one.
10834520	10835520	All right.
10835520	10836520	Later.
10836520	10837520	1877 Game OLR.
10837520	10838520	Your username on Skype is Orange Launch Radio.
10838520	10839520	Hi.
10839520	10840520	You're on Orange Launch Radio.
10840520	10841520	Who's this?
10841520	10842520	Hi.
10842520	10843520	Hello.
10843520	10844520	Hello, SSJ 100 Matt.
10844520	10845520	Two minutes.
10845520	10846520	Ready?
10846520	10847520	Go.
10847520	10848520	All right.
10848520	10850760	E3 overall, I enjoyed it quite a bit.
10850760	10857640	I enjoyed Sony's conference the most, well, not really the most, but I enjoyed the, you
10857640	10865000	know, Last Guardian, which actually made me cum a little, not going to lie.
10865000	10866000	Thanks for your honesty.
10866000	10869560	We're listening to KTMi.
10869560	10877560	And I like mag, and then I could, that's all I could think of at the time, but the thing
10877560	10881720	I wanted to call in about was Natal.
10881720	10887080	I think I mentioned this on Twitter, you know, I 100% agree with you.
10887080	10891920	We should be skeptical of this thing, because, you know, they talk pretty big with tech demo
10891920	10897060	videos, but, you know, until we get something tangible, because they didn't really show
10897060	10906080	us anything hands-on at the demonstration, just, you know, really the paint thing and
10906080	10912100	the break, the breakout type thing, but, you know, I would like to see what the third party
10912100	10916980	developers are going to do with this and whether or not they can pull something out off quick
10916980	10922340	enough that's, that will be before the end of the three sixties life cycle.
10922340	10925420	Now that they have their development kits, which apparently they just got.
10925420	10928440	So that's why I think this thing's still a ways out, but quickly, since you don't have
10928440	10931160	a lot of time left, any other thoughts you wanted to share?
10931160	10934160	This is Jay.
10934160	10935160	Two things.
10935160	10940240	I was kind of disappointed that they didn't, that weren't at E3, I'm disappointed that
10940240	10944640	Microsoft didn't mention anything about XNA, what they plan on doing with that.
10944640	10946800	Oh, that's a damn good point.
10946800	10947800	You're right.
10947800	10948800	There wasn't anything on that.
10948800	10949800	Okay.
10949800	10950800	Cause they didn't mention anything about it.
10950800	10955920	And, you know, they're going to kick it to the curb and treat it like the bastard child
10955920	10956920	it is.
10956920	10957920	What's the other thing.
10957920	10963800	And, um, and I was wondering where's Final Fantasy 13 versus.
10963800	10964800	Good question.
10964800	10965800	Good.
10965800	10966800	Yeah.
10966800	10967800	Nowhere to be seen 2011, if we're lucky.
10967800	10968800	All right.
10968800	10970800	As Jay 100, Matt, we got to let you go, but thanks for your thoughts.
10970800	10971800	Yep.
10971800	10972800	Boba Fett.
10972800	10973800	Take care.
10973800	10977640	Um, and you know, one thing about Microsoft's booth, you should know, usually Microsoft
10977640	10978800	is one of the most open companies.
10978800	10982320	Like they have one of the most open booths this year was like they were on lockdown.
10982320	10986080	There wasn't a lot to see in Microsoft's booth, unless you were a special person with a special
10986080	10990400	invite to go see the special things such as the demo of project at all and so forth.
10990400	10993140	They did not have anything like that out in the open this year.
10993140	10994560	Is it a coincidence?
10994560	10998760	The same year they let go a lot of their community people like the gamerscore blog folks, the
10998760	11003920	same year that happens, the Microsoft seems to be closed down a little more to the community.
11003920	11004920	I don't know.
11004920	11005920	Coincidence.
11005920	11011160	I was looking at, they have a really close up picture of the Natal camera and it looks
11011160	11017680	like it's got two sensors on it or two like, um, you know, actual cameras on it.
11017680	11021840	Almost like I think they're going to detect depth the same way as a human would detect
11021840	11026040	depth, you know, with the differences between the two images and figuring out where you
11026040	11027040	are based on that.
11027040	11028200	I think that's exactly what they're doing.
11028200	11029560	I think you're, I think you're right on track.
11029560	11033520	I think it's like the stereo images, you know, where you stare at it and the, you know, where
11033520	11036600	the two dots come together and you're supposed to see this, the sail ship and all that.
11036600	11038760	Are you going to be able to see the sailboat?
11038760	11039760	I don't know.
11039760	11040760	I'll try it.
11040760	11041760	Let's do one more call guys.
11041760	11042760	Uh, hi, you're on orange launch radio.
11042760	11043760	Who's this?
11043760	11044760	Hello?
11044760	11045760	Hello.
11045760	11046760	Who's this?
11046760	11047760	This is Marissa.
11047760	11048760	Hi, Marissa.
11048760	11049760	How are you my friend?
11049760	11050760	I'm all right.
11050760	11051760	How are you?
11051760	11052760	I'm sorry.
11052760	11058760	I just want to leave the house for all of these fans of what was called call of beauty
11058760	11059760	right now.
11059760	11060760	Oh, well, awesome.
11060760	11064360	Well, we're, we're talking about E3, but you've only got two minutes on, so what's on your
11064360	11065360	mind?
11065360	11070920	I just called to say hello and, um, the biggest disappointment of E3 was that you did not
11070920	11071920	call me.
11071920	11072920	I know.
11072920	11074000	I'm so sorry, Marissa.
11074000	11077860	I was just, I got so busy down there was my first trip with my boyfriend and everything
11077860	11080440	who's from LA and all this other stuff planned, but
11080440	11081440	I'm just teasing you.
11081440	11085500	Actually, the only like relevant gamer news to me is that I just found out they're coming
11085500	11086880	out with a C4.
11086880	11093360	Which is completely irrelevant to E3, but I just like clap my pants.
11093360	11097360	I guess there's a rule now it's the 11th, but my boyfriend just saw me dancing out in
11097360	11098360	the apartment.
11098360	11100960	He's like, you're a little too happy to see me, but you're happy that this game is coming
11100960	11101960	out?
11101960	11102960	Yes, honey.
11102960	11104960	Darren has a much sexier voice.
11104960	11105960	Nice.
11105960	11110800	Anyway, I also want to, I wanted to remind you to call the person who shall not be named
11110800	11112360	who I've been bothering you to call.
11112360	11113360	Yes, we will.
11113360	11116400	We will definitely get on that now that all the craziness of our expo is over and we're
11116400	11117400	bored again.
11117400	11118400	At least until PAX.
11118400	11119400	All right.
11119400	11120400	It sounded wonderful.
11120400	11122400	I'm so excited to hear all the updates.
11122400	11127520	It was in town, but all the LAers knew about it was that it kind of fucked up traffic.
11127520	11129520	That's all we know about it.
11129520	11132280	Well, hey, you know, I will be back.
11132280	11135960	I have a pass for Disneyland now, so I'll definitely be back.
11135960	11138920	So I will definitely let you know.
11138920	11142080	Maybe an OLR LA meetup, but Marissa, we're going to let you go so we can wrap up our
11142080	11143080	show.
11143080	11144080	Okay?
11144080	11145080	Absolutely.
11145080	11146080	And love to Jamie too.
11146080	11147080	Come hang out with me.
11147080	11148080	Yes.
11148080	11149080	Come to Sacramento.
11149080	11150080	Be on the show.
11150080	11151080	Please make it happen.
11151080	11152080	All right.
11152080	11153080	Take care, buddy.
11153080	11154080	All right.
11154080	11155080	We're going to go ahead and, uh, have that beat.
11155080	11156080	Last guy.
11156080	11157960	I think all the people that were dying to get through that through, we want to wrap
11157960	11158960	up.
11158960	11159960	We're already like three hours and counting.
11159960	11160960	We had a Marissa.
11160960	11161960	I know.
11161960	11162960	It was very nice to hear from her.
11162960	11165840	Uh, Loki, did you have anything else you wanted to get out there before we wrap up tonight?
11165840	11170800	Uh, Mel, your arcade is actually an arcade game apparently because I see images of the
11170800	11172380	cabinet now.
11172380	11173380	So that makes sense.
11173380	11175000	Well, there is another Xbox live arcade game then.
11175000	11177880	I don't know what it is.
11177880	11180680	Um, let's see.
11180680	11188160	Smash Brothers, um, brawl, the user online services ending, um, that not being the multiplayer
11188160	11193560	online service, but the service to upload user-generated snapshots, stage designs and
11193560	11196180	replay data will no longer be available.
11196180	11197180	Why is that?
11197180	11198180	That's kind of sad.
11198180	11199700	No word.
11199700	11200700	No word at all.
11200700	11201700	Um, interesting.
11201700	11202700	Yes.
11202700	11209240	Something else interesting, Smash Brothers Brawl related, apparently there's a flaw or
11209240	11215080	an exploit that's been discovered in the stage builder that will allow you to run, oh yes,
11215080	11217960	you know it, arbitrary homebrew code.
11217960	11218960	Yes.
11218960	11221020	This is why it's getting closed.
11221020	11222020	Here we go.
11222020	11230880	Another, uh, another, um, exploit, just like a Twilight Princess.
11230880	11235360	And then, um, let's see here.
11235360	11240720	And apparently Sony says that E3 is not a proper venue to announce any PS3 price drops.
11240720	11245040	Excuses, excuses.
11245040	11246040	That's it.
11246040	11247040	All right.
11247040	11248040	I'm having a change of heart.
11248040	11252320	I'm opening up the phone line one more time, so if we want to get a couple more calls in,
11252320	11256080	we'll give it just a minute to see if anyone else calls, and we'll give it a, again, two
11256080	11257400	minute rules in effect.
11257400	11262720	One eight seven seven game O-L-R, or our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio, and then we're
11262720	11263720	going to wrap up.
11263720	11265560	I don't know if we're going to do much of an after birth tonight.
11265560	11270800	I really want, I really want to get out of here by 10 o'clock tonight, so yeah, because
11270800	11271800	I got to work at six tomorrow.
11271800	11273320	We need a ten second window.
11273320	11274320	Ten second window.
11274320	11275320	No more done.
11275320	11277360	I think everybody that really wanted to get through got through.
11277360	11278360	Seven.
11278360	11279360	Oh, we got another one.
11279360	11282440	Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio, who's this?
11282440	11283440	Deathwishing.
11283440	11284440	Death?
11284440	11285440	Hello, Deathwishing.
11285440	11287520	You have two minutes, go.
11287520	11290960	Um, okay, first of all, everyone, get Fuel.
11290960	11294400	It's like, for me, even if you're not going to like it, rent it, because it's just so
11294400	11295400	massive.
11295400	11300680	It's 5,000 square miles of just racing, and it's just, wow.
11300680	11301680	Interesting.
11301680	11306000	I've heard a lot of negative things about Fuel on the game review sites, but that's
11306000	11307000	now two people.
11307000	11309120	Yeah, like Edge and IGN, but those sites suck anyways.
11309120	11310120	True enough.
11310120	11311120	Okay, I'm sorry.
11311120	11312120	Go ahead.
11312120	11313120	Anyways, here we go with E3.
11313120	11314120	Assassin's Creed 2.
11314120	11317200	I'm going to show you, if I say, ugh, that means it's good, and if I go, oh, that means
11317200	11318200	no.
11318200	11321160	Assassin's Creed 2, yes.
11321160	11326280	Splinter Cell Conviction, I shit my pants.
11326280	11333640	Halo Reach, I'm actually excited because it's a Halo based on the book, Follow Reach,
11333640	11340040	which is going to explain why there's Spartans and why there's only four.
11340040	11346600	And I'm sorry, but the PS3 motion control looks like a sex toy.
11346600	11348360	You say this like it's a problem.
11348360	11349360	I think it is.
11349360	11351160	It looks like a sex toy.
11351160	11352160	Maybe it is.
11352160	11353160	Oh.
11353160	11357680	Why do we have a problem with this?
11357680	11360960	It's going to give little kids ideas.
11360960	11364120	Well that's just because their mommy and daddy didn't teach them right.
11364120	11369040	It's just going to encourage people to put glowing balls on their penis and then try
11369040	11370640	to get the thing to follow their penis.
11370640	11371880	Hey, you know what, it's fine.
11371880	11372880	It's fine.
11372880	11375960	For boys, you can put the Wii Vitalize on your wiener.
11375960	11378880	For the girls, you can put the PS3 motion control on your pussy.
11378880	11379880	I'm not finished.
11379880	11380880	Oh, sorry.
11380880	11385380	Project Natal, I could, like, you know how with Rainbow Six Vegas, you could do the facial
11385380	11388200	scan and put your face in the game?
11388200	11391320	Now think of Project Natal putting your whole body in the game.
11391320	11397920	Also, remember they showed that little tech demo with Peter Monono and that little child?
11397920	11400120	Remember when he needed a drawing?
11400120	11401120	Come on!
11401120	11402840	Someone's going to put their penis on there!
11402840	11403840	It's going to happen!
11403840	11405160	Yeah, I know that.
11405160	11407440	I can't wait to scan my new body.
11407440	11411040	When you use that in a game, a first person shooter, what's going to happen to the fat
11411040	11412040	guy?
11412040	11413040	He's going to have a bigger hitbox.
11413040	11417040	Alright, quickly, because we talked over your call, I'll give you fifteen more seconds to
11417040	11421040	wrap it up.
11421040	11423820	I've been playing one versus one hundred and you need to join in, Rob.
11423820	11427080	This is like Tuesday during, I think they're having another live episode, the twelfth,
11427080	11428400	and I would join in if I were you.
11428400	11429400	I will try to play.
11429400	11430400	I will do my best.
11430400	11431400	Alright, we've got to let you go.
11431400	11432400	Have fun.
11432400	11433400	Bye!
11433400	11434400	Bye!
11434400	11439600	I liked his whole uh and buh scale that he didn't even really use.
11439600	11444160	It was fascinating.
11444160	11448580	Marissa asked in chat, what is it with guys inputting their penis everywhere and Frisbee
11448580	11452620	has the right answer because they can.
11452620	11454440	We talked about this a little earlier in the show.
11454440	11460200	I don't, I don't do it but I just report it how I see it and history has proven itself.
11460200	11464320	If it can have a penis put in on it, a penis will be put on it.
11464320	11467800	Folks, we do not make the news, we merely report on it.
11467800	11469000	The cock always wins, huh?
11469000	11471760	Alright, on that thought, we've got to go around and give everybody's final thoughts.
11471760	11472840	We're on out of here for tonight.
11472840	11475320	Loki, any final thoughts?
11475320	11478300	I'm glad to be back, I'm tired.
11478300	11481200	My final thought is, sleep is awesome.
11481200	11483240	Dark Soccer, do you have any final thoughts?
11483240	11486480	My husband didn't bring me a milkshake, I'm disappointed.
11486480	11488280	He's so fired for that.
11488280	11492080	Alright, thank you guys so much for tuning into and downloading our show, we really appreciate
11492080	11493080	it.
11493080	11496400	Thank you for supporting Independent Podcasting, you guys are amazing and thank you for staying
11496400	11500760	up late with us tonight and putting up with our crap if you're listening to it on the
11500760	11502880	podcast feed, getting all the way here to the end.
11502880	11504340	Really appreciate it.
11504340	11507640	Thank you guys again so much, if you like what you hear, please tell two friends about
11507640	11509920	our show, word of mouth is how we sell it.
11509920	11513760	Thank you guys so much, have a wonderful night, we will see you next week with more gaming
11513760	11514760	news.
11514760	11517480	Hey, just because E3's over doesn't mean the video game news is stopping, we'll be back
11517480	11519280	next week.
11519280	11522160	Maybe since we'll probably have a lull in the news next week since everybody shot their
11522160	11526780	wad this week, maybe next week we'll be able to play some good old fashioned OLR games.
11526780	11528120	So look forward to that next week.
11528120	11530040	I think that sounds like a stupendous idea.
11530040	11534320	Alright then, stay tuned to next week in another stupendous show.
11534320	11538680	In the meantime, I am the stupendous Rob Roberts, that's the amazing Jamie Summers and he's
11538680	11542720	the OK Loki, and we'll see you next week here on Orange Lounge Radio.
