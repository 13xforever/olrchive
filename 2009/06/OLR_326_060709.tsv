14175	15996	and I, June 7th, 2009.
16317	23101	We're all here in studio with your phone calls and chat romantics to discuss this year's highs and lows of E3.
31840	32440	DarkSakura, Jamie Summers
52825	54006	I am doing okay.
54266	58089	I was a little worried you weren't going to be here tonight at first, but things pulled through and now you're here.
58469	62412	I thought that I had a school orientation, and it turns out that I don't.
62972	63933	Well, that's a good thing though, right?
64133	65114	That means I have it next week.
65294	66635	Now you can sit here and party with us.
67295	68876	Yep, it's all parties all the time.
69077	70658	Alright, or you can play Sims 3.
70718	73320	Hey, I can do both at the same time.
73340	73920	Alright, no, that's fine.
74200	76742	Alright, also say hello to the one and only Techmaster Loki.
77022	77222	Hello.
77242	77623	Alright.
77643	77943	Alright.
78954	81097	Loki's able to do the show and look at porn at the same time.
81137	81638	It's amazing.
81778	82779	No, I'm just kidding.
82799	83881	Are you looking at porn?
84041	88827	Although my wife is adding bookmarks for porn on my computer, I like to add.
89648	89969	Nice.
91130	92132	How very thoughtful of her.
93952	95653	All right, well, how you doing today, Loki?
95693	97174	You just got back from L.A.
97194	97635	today, right?
97655	99396	Yeah, like four hours ago.
99916	104539	Most people leave E3 like Friday, but you stayed over till today to do stuff with the wife.
104659	109682	Yes, and that reminds me, she wanted me to add a few things about E3.
109743	110243	She says...
110803	136368	E3 sucked because she had to stay in a hotel room and because the people in the hotel room had open wifi but for whatever reason she couldn't connect to them so she couldn't download the porn fast enough and then she was also pissed off at my computer because it didn't have Yahoo Instant Messenger installed on it anymore that's because a Windows update crashed and I had to reinstall the whole thing so that's her complaint oh and Universal sucks
137808	140769	Universal Studios Universal Studios Universal Studios Universal Studios
167880	168981	Circling of the Trims.
169041	170322	The Mario thing was later in the week.
170342	171242	Yeah, he took over.
171262	172183	Maybe it was the second night.
172203	172463	I don't know.
172503	174684	I actually watched every night of Conan O'Brien.
174784	178066	I saw the sign to go in there and I was like, oh, I want to go in there.
178206	178886	But we couldn't.
179286	180687	What day were you at Universal Studios?
180707	182448	We were there Thursday afternoon.
182488	183328	We went there Friday.
183469	185450	It's like we kept missing each other the next few days.
185470	185870	That's all right.
185910	187691	Well, yeah.
188211	189392	Universal Studios sucks.
190352	190852	Sorry to hear that.
190872	191493	I've never been there.
191573	192213	I've never been there.
193353	195874	I thought they had like a Jurassic Park ride and a Simpsons ride.
195914	197775	Yeah, that a pregnant woman can't ride.
198255	198395	Oh.
198555	201296	And the Simpsons ride, pregnant people can't ride that either.
201416	202757	Pregnant women can't ride a lot.
202817	203557	I hate to break it to you.
203697	208479	I know, but, you know... Violent motions shaking around your belly are not good for twins.
208559	212441	Yes, but beside that, though, I mean, they really only have four rides.
212461	216122	They have the Jurassic Park ride, the Mummy Returns ride, or whatever.
216142	217883	They have the Simpsons ride...
220068	236856	and there's maybe one other one I'm not sure but that's all they have at Great America or at not Great America Universal I mean come on for a theme park that's pretty shitty I mean my only bitch is that Universal CityWalk is extremely overpriced and by the way if you don't know what this is
237416	241458	LA, they have the Universal Compound right off 101 Freeway.
241798	245719	That's where Universal Studios is, where Conan O'Brien tapes his show now.
246139	248100	It's where they do a lot of special events.
248180	250821	It's where the More Friends concert was a couple years ago.
251161	258744	Not Dear Friends, the one More Friends concert they did at E305 was there at the Amphitheater, I think.
259384	262465	Yeah, I think it was 05, because 04 was the first Dear Friends, 05 was More Friends.
262885	263166	And then...
264747	265288	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
280888	283131	I know what you're talking about, but I don't remember what it's called.
283191	285275	I know someone in chat is going to yell it out in any minute.
285295	294468	Chat.OrangeLoungeRadio.com The one episode of that show I saw, they actually taped at Universal CityWalk, so a lot of people know what this place is, but it's extremely overpriced.
295639	296039	That's all.
296099	298440	But I guess, you know, you expect these types of things are going to be.
298840	299681	So, yeah.
300221	300461	All right.
300701	302982	Anyhow, enough about theme park rides and so on.
303022	304462	We have a lot of ground we're going to cover tonight.
304803	305763	Here's the interesting thing.
306223	307443	And I want to say thank you.
307504	308544	Chat is now piping up.
308604	310024	Chase, Chase, Chase.
310245	310965	It's called Chase.
311405	311645	All right.
312045	313806	So thank you, chatters.
314946	316707	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
339915	342217	So we didn't end up having an outline at all.
342697	343738	My husband volunteered.
343858	344299	Yeah, I know.
344359	344919	Dan volunteered.
344939	346180	I volunteered him for you.
346360	349723	But Dan is not used to having to prepare anything.
349783	352085	Dan just comes in here, is funny, and leaves.
352445	353847	That's Dan's role in the show.
354307	355088	Sounds like my marriage.
357748	359149	I'm sure he'd be very happy to hear that.
359249	360589	Can we get him in here to comment on that?
360609	360869	No.
361069	361329	All right.
361890	367712	So tonight we're just, we have no, I mean, I don't know when part A is going to end and part B is going to begin.
368132	369733	We just, we're winging it tonight.
369873	372034	But we know we have a lot of ground to cover with E3 News.
372334	373694	So I'm just warning everybody up front.
373754	376495	If the show feels a little weird tonight, it is.
376895	377836	So there you go.
378516	380417	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
398960	399261	It's tough.
399461	400122	You know what?
400242	405170	E3 was smaller than it was in 06 when they did the last big one.
405510	407693	But this is how I've been describing E3 to people.
408174	412500	It was E3 2006 with less Paris Hilton, and that's a great thing.
413632	414633	Booth Babes are not cheap.
438983	440264	It costs a lot for all that silicone
455218	472292	and some companies like Nyko is the one that comes to mind the ones that have the big inflatable Wii controllers they did have some booth babes Nintendo had their I want a big inflatable Wii controller Nintendo didn't have booth babes but they had the educated good looking women that were showing off they just weren't dressed cheaply
474674	477315	and a couple, I mean, I'm not saying there weren't any Booth Babes anywhere.
477335	478596	There were the Trauma Center Babes.
478796	482118	I think one of the Capcom games or something had some Booth Babes.
482378	485279	There just were way less than I saw at E3 2006.
485660	487581	And I, in part, blame the economy.
488001	489041	I don't see that as a bad thing.
489261	492023	I think the economy cut back on a lot of those types of things this year.
492563	493784	Less silicone, more games.
493884	496986	And zero booth studs that I saw.
497006	498107	Well, now that's a travesty.
498167	499868	That is a huge travesty.
499888	500248	But anyway.
501249	502590	Equal, you know.
502850	504171	Equal opportunity, absolutely.
504191	504632	Equal representation.
504652	509075	There's more and more women going to E3 working and doing, you know, women play games.
509095	510616	Sometimes we want booth babes too.
510636	510976	Surprise.
511857	512137	All right.
512397	516640	And, you know, I happen to be one of those guys who wouldn't mind seeing some of those booth studs.
516880	519342	But I've learned to just accept that's not going to happen.
519802	520223	So whatever.
520483	522064	Well, it is fun harassing the booth babes, though.
523213	527299	Anyhow, let's get into your gaming week Besides E3, how was your gaming week?
528184	530425	I did what I'm doing right now.
530965	531325	Which is?
531345	532046	Playing Sims.
532626	534306	Now, not just old school Sims.
534606	535907	So you at least played a new game.
536447	536867	Oh, yes.
536967	548031	And we've actually had full reviews posted on it on the blog I contribute to that Tiara keeps at AvengersTower.com.
549432	550432	She reviewed the game itself.
550492	556735	I reviewed the exchange in the store and the house mechanics, which, you know me, I love building the houses.
557575	559558	I'm building the Avengers Mansion right now.
559878	561080	Also, give us a little synopsis.
561100	564684	What makes this game special compared to previous installments in the franchise?
564744	567308	It's new, and really, that's not very special right now.
567328	570231	I mean, a lot of the play in it is improved.
570752	572655	You can put diagonal...
573135	575816	Furniture and change a few things.
575856	577577	The build a house mode is a lot better.
578597	580778	You can definitely customize your body shapes a bit more.
580818	583219	But see, there's a problem is that the faces are butt ugly.
583740	586201	And it takes a lot of adjustment to get them not butt ugly.
586781	587761	And they have no chins.
588662	591383	And what are all the other...
592984	593924	Thanks for watching!
616196	631273	and you can actually buy points to use in their store and they've got some neat stuff in the store but the only thing that I was actually super excited about was like a lamp and a bathtub because it was a really cool bathtub sounds like a trip to Ikea I want an Ikea pack
631953	633714	Sims 2 had Ikea packs.
634035	635276	I want an Ikea pack.
635296	635776	For real?
636196	636636	Yeah!
636857	637917	There's a huge Sims culture.
637937	646283	I think a lot of times, you know, because our show, we try to touch on PC gaming, and I think we do to an extent, but I think, you know, I'll admit it, we stay pretty focused on consoles.
646703	651987	And I think sometimes, even the PC gamers, we neglect how huge the Sims franchise is.
652567	654689	Isn't the Sims, like, the best-selling PC game ever?
656209	657150	I'm pretty sure it is.
657690	659611	So there's this huge culture around it.
659671	662732	I would have never guessed, however, that there was actually Ikea packs for Sims 2.
662932	663552	That's hilarious.
663652	673176	Yeah, I mean, the whole thing about The Sims is that, you know, especially through cheating, like me, you can have all kinds of neat stuff happen.
673536	674317	You know, for people...
675317	676218	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
692293	693713	DarkSakura.com
711898	714999	Now, speaking of exchange, I don't think Sims 2 had this.
715119	719780	This sounds more like what Spore had, where you can publish all your creations to the web, right?
720120	721201	You could do it with Sims 2.
721641	739326	They had, you know, where you could post up your stuff, but you had to, of course, register your game, and really, they didn't have anything on there that you couldn't get anywhere else, you know, once the big mod forums came out, which, actually, I'll go ahead and plug my favorite right now, modthesims.com.
740467	745902	They're probably the best one out there So overall with Sims 3, all you were hoping for and more?
746784	751285	I really had very little in the way of expectation, so I like it.
751665	752526	I'm not displeased with it.
752566	757707	I like that you can, if the floor or something is butt ugly, you can just change it.
758807	768370	You can actually go in, in any of the floors that you lay down, you can actually go back in and change the color of them.
769190	772011	This little tool that I have here is a palette tool.
772891	787007	and you can go in if it will let me and actually change the various colors in it by sliding the little slider and it'll change all the colors and then you can just copy that one and paste it all over the place.
787267	787848	It's really neat.
787948	789309	I've done a few custom floors myself.
790110	790991	Reading some chat comments.
791031	795694	Chat.OrangeLawnRadio.com Decipher is in chat and wants to clarify Sims 2 had it.
796054	799396	It just wasn't as intuitive, I believe, talking about the whole web interface.
799536	801578	This is actually super easy.
802058	804840	Like, um... Oh, come on, you butthead.
807123	809705	I talk to my games all the time, that's right.
811186	815189	For example, I'm just going to show you with a piece of furniture.
816310	820533	Say that I put this stupidly ugly bed...
821694	822075	Right here.
823015	826058	And I hate that this stupidly ugly bed is stupidly ugly.
826558	827479	So I want to change it.
827599	830362	So I hit my little palette thing.
830442	831643	Oh my god, it is an ugly bed.
833184	837328	And then I can go through and say, you know what, I really hate this rose pattern thing.
838148	840150	I want this leaf pattern instead.
840711	844134	So I can pick the leaf pattern as soon as all this other crap loads.
845236	852212	and my computer's a little taxed of course because I have everything running for the show but it will change the bedspread to
855579	859142	It seems to me that you play Sims really for the design element.
859182	860683	You really like to design the houses.
860723	863305	You like to design the furniture and color every little piece.
863905	864846	Is there stuff there?
864866	866127	Because I suck at designing.
866167	867488	Is there something in this game for me?
867608	868909	Is there actual game to play?
869029	870811	Well, you can just pick a house.
871391	873413	You can download houses that other people have done.
873833	875535	After you've murdered the family.
876940	880342	No, you have empty lots and you can evict people.
880782	883484	And right now it's still thinking about changing that bedspread to green.
883884	887066	But what would happen is I would save it here and then I would pick share.
888106	892569	And then when I go in, you have this other thing that's called the launcher.
893666	895427	which is the first thing that loads up when you play the game.
895447	896528	Does that launch Sims?
898229	899010	Out of a cannon.
899070	901492	Sorry, it's modthesims.info by the way.
903353	904935	The site.
905255	915102	But then you go into this and you can actually, those are screenshots up there, but you can select that one of the items that you've saved specifically for sharing and click upload.
915803	922468	And almost instantly it's on the exchange for you and everybody else in the universe to see all the crap that you've managed to make.
922688	925751	And again, kind of like Spores Creature Creator kind of reminds me of that.
925891	927432	And of course, everything that you've picked for download.
927472	932456	And this also works now for the content that's up on Mod the Sims right now.
933037	937801	Is that you just click on the little pack and it loads it into this and you can choose to install it in your game.
938821	939382	It's pretty neat.
939762	940503	I think it's pretty neat.
940983	941304	All right.
941404	942945	Well, maybe I'll have to check that out a little later.
944266	944706	It's worth it.
944786	945467	I think it's worthwhile.
945827	947929	Well, let's move on and talk about more gaming weeks.
948129	948590	It changed.
949942	951283	Finally, it changed to that green pattern.
951363	951944	It's camo.
952724	956987	Loki, besides the stuff you played at E3, because we'll have plenty of time for that in a little bit, how was your gaming week?
957628	959969	I played Fuel, more Fuel at least.
960209	961710	It was fun.
962451	966774	Still driving around, trying to get more stuff unlocked.
967634	972718	Really just trying to drive around and collect more Fuel containers to unlock more cars.
974699	975540	Man, that game is big.
977293	980576	I'm going to spend one of these days actually just trying to drive across the whole map.
981437	982638	But it probably will take a whole day.
983919	984839	Because it's that big.
986120	990764	It seems... I'm looking at some of the reviews for that game because I'm considering picking it up.
990804	992686	It seems like it's getting very average reviews.
992926	996189	People don't think, I guess, the implementation is good or something.
996229	997890	I don't know what people's problems is with it.
998050	998571	It's alright.
998591	999952	I don't know.
1000633	1001633	There's nothing really like it.
1001653	1001713	And...
1005743	1007805	I don't know, probably the next racing game similar to it.
1007825	1011829	It's going to be Dirt 2 and that's not out until September.
1013191	1020118	Actually, there's no real racing games I think coming out until September other than Fuel, which has already come out.
1020979	1022861	So, yeah.
1023326	1023787	I don't know.
1024548	1026550	Anything else besides the E3 stuff?
1026770	1027451	More Grand Theft Auto 4.
1027491	1028612	That's about it.
1028972	1029293	Of course.
1030474	1042807	My gaming week, obviously with E3 kind of being this week, there wasn't a whole lot I played outside of E3, but I will tell you, once I got home, one of the first things I wanted to do... Well, I did play a little bit of Final Fantasy XI, because I mentioned in a previous show I'd gone back to it.
1042828	1043969	I haven't played a whole lot...
1044289	1044809	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1068260	1069000	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1091045	1091686	Oh crap!
1092046	1094588	Final Fantasy 4 The After Years came out this week.
1094748	1099691	I have got to go play that because Final Fantasy 4 is like my favorite Final Fantasy ever.
1099731	1103814	At least the one I have the most nostalgia with.
1104134	1108357	Because that was my first real in-depth Final Fantasy game that I just got totally immersed with.
1108377	1112740	I mean I remember playing the very first one on the NES when I was like 9 or 10 years old.
1112760	1113701	I don't even remember how old I was.
1114061	1116723	But I remember playing that very first one on the NES and it was cool.
1117183	1117663	But um...
1118784	1123785	I didn't really get immersed until Final Fantasy 2 here in the US, which as we all know is really 4.
1124606	1129887	So finally, I'm very excited to hear the sequel came out and it's on cell phones.
1130227	1138049	So I checked out Final Fantasy 4 The After Years on the Wii and yeah, my nostalgia strings were successfully tugged.
1138609	1141010	I was kind of surprised at how...
1142620	1143441	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1164492	1168533	But, of course, I had to remind myself, okay, Rob, you are playing a port of a cell phone game.
1168613	1174475	So, I mean, I guess if I could compare it to anything, it would be very similar to playing, like, Final Fantasy IV on Game Boy Advance or WonderSwan Color.
1174795	1178657	Like, you know, that kind of, like, slightly souped-up upgrade from the original Super Nintendo one.
1180891	1181051	Ghosts!
1196244	1201846	If you want to get the seven other episodes with the spinoff characters, they're like 300 Wii points each.
1201926	1204667	And then the final chapter is supposed to be another 800 points.
1205107	1207347	But I guess they're rolling this out slowly.
1207388	1209468	Like there's a side story on Rydia out now.
1209568	1210669	I haven't really played it yet.
1210909	1211769	I plan to, though.
1212809	1219471	And then once you complete all these side stories, you can use the characters from the side stories in the closing chapter is what I hear is supposed to happen.
1219931	1221112	So, I mean, that's kind of cool.
1221972	1222832	Here's the thing.
1223292	1227854	It plays and feels like Final Fantasy IV on the Super Nintendo, not on the DS.
1227914	1228934	No voice acting, nothing.
1228974	1230095	I mean, it plays and feels.
1230375	1246380	So if you want an old-school Super Nintendo RPG, if that's what you've been clamoring for, if that's what you miss, much like Mega Man 9 appealed to you because you missed the old-school NES Mega Man games, then you will like Final Fantasy IV The After Years.
1246920	1247480	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1264505	1267246	It's a fairly well written story, at least what I've gotten into so far.
1267946	1271948	Just playing it all over again is kind of making me giddy.
1272368	1275510	I actually kind of am having a lot of fun with it, and that's what really games are all about.
1275550	1279671	So if you want the nostalgia of Final Fantasy IV all over again, definitely go check this out.
1280332	1282993	But you know what this made me think about as I was playing it?
1284321	1291505	Here's the thing, what really made me think about this was this whole story that we've been covering on the show the last couple weeks.
1291565	1294446	You know how Square shut down that Chrono Trigger fan project?
1294786	1303010	Remember how somebody was making this Chrono Trigger ROM for the Super Nintendo that was like, it was like using the old Chrono Trigger data but it was like a new story and all this stuff, remember this?
1303310	1307632	And Square sent them a cease and desist letter and we were like, you bastards, why did you shut down this project?
1307652	1308593	It was just a fan thing.
1309173	1314061	I realized this week they shut it down because that's what they did with Final Fantasy IV The After Years.
1314341	1315143	That's what it is.
1315563	1319409	It's a reskinned Final Fantasy IV with new dialogue, new stuff.
1321212	1322894	It didn't hit me until now.
1322934	1324655	Square is doing... They're like, don't do it before us.
1325095	1325295	Huh?
1325436	1326256	They're like, don't do it before us.
1326276	1327417	Yes, in a way.
1328158	1333842	I mean, even though this game's already been out in Japan on cell phones for a while, I think that's why they shut the Chrono Trigger project down.
1334183	1338806	If this Final Fantasy 4 thing is successful, I'll bet you they're going to do one for Chrono Trigger.
1339307	1340488	It's probably cheap to do.
1342085	1343327	So there's your answer, guys.
1343347	1344628	That's why it got shut down.
1344729	1345510	It is cheap to do.
1345570	1352980	All it is is programming scenarios and no real sprite creating since you're using the same sprites.
1353420	1355984	Just creating a few world maps with already sprites.
1356024	1357005	To be fair, and Henry,
1357005	1357626	Thank you for watching!
1383729	1388135	Like Devil's Road, which is the road that connects Mysidia and Baron.
1388575	1392280	You used to just go in there and it would be and you'd appear in Baron.
1392540	1401552	Well now they've actually made, I don't think this is very spoilery and I apologize if you feel it is, but they've made a little dungeon to go with the connection now that you have to work your way through.
1402332	1406674	To say they have just only re-skinned it, that wouldn't be a fair thing to say.
1407055	1409376	They have done minor tweaks.
1409676	1414438	But I'm telling you, you're going to play this game and you're going to be like, I feel like I'm playing Final Fantasy 4+.
1415639	1423663	I feel like I've popped in my Final Fantasy 2 cartridge from the Super Nintendo and unlocked a whole secret level that wasn't there.
1423963	1424943	That's what it feels like.
1425624	1430286	And that's why this Chrono Trigger fan project got shut down because maybe this is the direction Square is heading in.
1432695	1458148	um let's see uh the Rob D in chat says the translator for Final Fantasy 6 apparently wasn't a Star Wars fan well all the Super Nintendo Final Fantasies yeah I remember it was it was something to do with Star Wars it was always Biggs and Wedge that's right okay so thank you Rob D that's right VIX was a mistranslation in the American Final Fantasy 2 and 3 they did VIX instead of Wedge but but or instead of Biggs so it makes sense I figured it was something like that as well but not in 7 mm-hmm remember
1459158	1462962	BlackWolf, our good buddy who celebrated his 200th episode right before we went live tonight, says in chat, It's really not.
1463622	1465344	300 points for a couple hours worth of gameplay I think is worth it.
1483061	1484983	But, you know, I just understand.
1485003	1487665	You're going to be spending your money on something old school.
1487705	1493550	If you're spoiled by all these newfangled 3D graphics and things, I don't know if there's a lot here for you.
1493590	1498034	But if you love Final Fantasy 4 as much as I do, you're going to love this, I think.
1498134	1499655	I think it's definitely worth the price.
1499715	1503298	And quite honestly, I think all the add-ons will probably be worth it too.
1503618	1506801	Hell, I saw a great argument the other day on a forum or something.
1507041	1509764	Final Fantasy 2 as a cartridge when it came out was like $70.
1509804	1509984	Right?
1511365	1511826	Thank you for watching!
1523226	1524266	So, there you go.
1524546	1528728	And HendersonManInChat apparently is a fan of the game and says, and that's what I wanted from the after years.
1529548	1532709	By the way, Rydia's story is $3 for about 4 hours.
1533129	1536790	So yeah, I mean, don't get me wrong, I'm not slamming the game for what they're doing.
1536950	1538430	It's just, you know, know what you're getting into.
1538510	1539730	I was caught a little off guard.
1540071	1546732	I was expecting it to be kind of like newer and fancier, but now that I'm kind of playing it, I'm like, you know, there's a part of me that's kind of glad it's not.
1547793	1550373	It is kind of neat to revisit that game I loved.
1550593	1552034	Literally loved.
1553013	1555275	15 years ago, 18 years ago.
1556576	1562560	I do endorse Final Fantasy IV The After Years if you are a fan of Final Fantasy IV at all.
1565945	1568147	Rob D in chat says, yes, but times are different now.
1568187	1570328	Why should we judge it by antiquated pricing?
1570368	1571589	Not to say it's not worth it.
1571629	1573070	I just don't think that's a good argument.
1573911	1574351	Fair enough.
1574411	1575111	I see your point.
1575272	1577833	But, you know, there's a lot of crap out there.
1577873	1581896	They are trying to charge this $5 and $10 and do some of this episodic money for.
1582917	1591083	I think, you know, again, if you know what you're getting into, if you want that Final Fantasy IV old school nostalgia, you know, not a lot of people complain about Mega Man 9.
1592664	1593865	I think it's going to be worth it.
1594813	1596995	I did import the Sailor Moon Super S fighting game for $110.
1622754	1623955	My early days of importing.
1624075	1626777	Yeah, import game is a whole other story.
1626857	1629119	So there you go.
1629660	1633443	So Henderson Mann kind of concludes, this is the last thing I want to say on the Final Fantasy IV After Years.
1633883	1634884	Well, think of it like this.
1634964	1642010	The total price for Final Fantasy IV The After Years is $37 for the full game, about the same price as a DS game remake.
1642190	1642770	And that's true.
1642970	1643591	And you know what?
1643691	1646233	And in the end, when you add up all these hours, it would be what, like 21?
1647474	1651317	Probably about 30 hours of gameplay, which is about what you get out of a DS cartridge anyway.
1651397	1651898	So, you know,
1653050	1655932	But just again, not going to be your cutting edge graphics.
1656572	1658354	Think Mega Man 9, but Final Fantasy.
1658714	1659374	That's all I'm saying.
1659975	1661095	I'd pay for it, seriously.
1663457	1666839	My nostalgia strings are extremely tickled by this game.
1667980	1668420	Extremely.
1669401	1671002	And I hear the story gets really good.
1671122	1672463	I'm really avoiding spoilers.
1672863	1677026	I'm probably only about an hour and a half, two hours into the main episode.
1677426	1678707	I know I have plenty more to go.
1679427	1682049	But I'm squeeing so far.
1682958	1684622	Are you squeeing in a girly manner?
1685464	1686106	A little bit of both.
1688908	1692529	Anyhow, let's move on and get into some housekeeping tonight.
1692849	1693249	Housekeeping.
1693569	1697550	We are slowly getting the podcast caught up after our storage drive corruption.
1697570	1698510	We're almost caught up now.
1698550	1703051	We just need last week and this week, and this should all be caught up by the time the next show airs.
1703111	1707292	So sorry again to our faithful who listen to us on the podcast feed.
1707352	1709232	Sorry we have not been more reliable recently.
1709652	1712673	I hope you will still stick with us and continue to tell friends about the show.
1713073	1715673	It is never our intent to make you feel abandoned.
1716054	1716814	So sorry about that.
1718374	1727338	Also, I don't really have a whole lot else, so follow us on Twitter at twitter.com slash OLR or our Facebook is Orange Lounge Radio.
1727678	1730719	I'm pretty much going to stop plugging MySpace because I'm pretty much over MySpace.
1730999	1733020	Does anyone use MySpace anymore?
1733581	1734341	I did last night.
1735461	1735782	To what?
1735822	1736542	Clear out spam?
1736662	1737162	That's what I did.
1737202	1743785	No, to look up a band called Stovacore, which is a band that's all heavy metal that dresses up like Klingons and singing Klingon.
1744625	1750069	Well, alright, we're on MySpace, and if you want to add us there, you can, but I'm going to be honest, we haven't been doing a whole lot with it.
1750109	1751910	But to be honest, we haven't done a lot with Facebook either.
1752250	1754052	We need to tape, like, special shows and things.
1754412	1759876	I will say this, though, our YouTube channel, after, like, two or three years, will finally get some new content.
1759916	1762477	We did take video on the E3 show floor.
1762537	1768882	We got me singing Karaoke Revolution, the new DDR games, Split Second, so there will be some stuff going to the Orange Archery.
1768902	1771704	You have me looking incredibly bored playing the new DDR game.
1772386	1773887	Because it's incredibly boring
1790399	1798883	Let's talk about music games, because there's been some very good music games at E3, some very bad music games at E3, and some very non-existent music games at E3.
1798963	1799844	That's where I want to start.
1800064	1801324	Where the hell was DJ Hero?
1801644	1803545	Isn't this game supposed to be out in a couple months?
1803785	1805306	It was shown behind closed doors.
1805366	1806066	Well, how nice.
1807267	1808448	Did they let people play it?
1808708	1811169	No, they had it demoed on a live stage.
1811209	1815631	They had it demoed in front of a crowd, and that was pretty cool, but they didn't let people play it.
1817446	1818306	and I'm very disappointed.
1837270	1837791	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1860009	1861871	DJ Hero 5, Guitar Hero Van Halen
1884346	1886307	Guitar Hero Van Halen was at Sony's booth
1902972	1904613	But they had it on stage.
1904633	1905874	They were demoing it on stage.
1906474	1909156	And DJ Hero looks sweet.
1909356	1910257	Yeah, I mean, don't get me wrong.
1910317	1912178	DJ Hero looks great.
1912518	1913899	But it looks fun to play.
1914759	1916040	I want to play it.
1916060	1918181	I want to get my hands on it and see for myself.
1918482	1918942	I understand.
1919062	1920103	Maybe that's what they're trying to do.
1920783	1923224	Maybe that's what they're trying to do, is leave it a mystery for all of us.
1924765	1930748	I still get frustrated at E3 when I see these millions of dollars spent to do this big DJ hero show.
1930868	1931348	For what?
1931368	1933730	For something behind closed doors for special people.
1933830	1935430	I don't think people are quite 100% behind it yet.
1936051	1938472	Before, they were only showing half the controller.
1939152	1939732	What the hell?
1940493	1945175	Before, they were probably expecting people to go, Oh my goodness, what is this?
1945195	1945956	This looks so cool.
1945976	1947356	I want to learn more about it.
1947416	1948517	But people were just kind of going...
1949448	1950469	How the hell are you going to play this?
1951050	1951730	This looks dumb.
1951870	1952531	What are they doing?
1952891	1960038	And then they finally, just during E3, they finally released the rest of the pictures of what the actual controller was.
1961199	1971249	Besides the fact that it was in Game Informer, but actually having it free to look at outside of Game Informer, they just put out the stuff for it.
1971950	1972030	Um...
1973226	1984451	But yeah, I mean, it looks cool, and I like watching it being performed, and they did both just, you know, an actual song, and then they did the one that they had the Beastie Boys mashup thing where the guy was playing the guitar.
1984951	1989113	Both of them look pretty cool, but I don't know.
1989213	1992494	I mean, besides, you know, being able to play it, I mean, it looks cool.
1994383	1996324	Did you hear what they're doing with DDR?
2014139	2014579	No, what?
2014899	2016060	Oh, you're going to love this.
2016100	2017401	You're going to love this.
2017421	2018221	Can I mini rant?
2018341	2018701	Go ahead.
2018741	2022043	Why don't I do my mini rant, and then you can piss me off even more with what you're about to say.
2022063	2022263	All right.
2022283	2022843	Okay?
2023824	2028766	Keep in mind, folks, this show would not exist if it weren't for DDR.
2029487	2034429	I love what DDR has done for my life and the people it's introduced me to and all of this stuff.
2034809	2036550	That being said... Uh-oh.
2036810	2037490	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2058775	2064879	People were kind of heckling and saying, this is just going to turn into a sports game.
2064979	2066721	It's the roster update 2009.
2067421	2068442	It's just new songs.
2069102	2070123	I apologize.
2070263	2071004	You were right.
2071944	2072445	You were right.
2072665	2074186	That's what the franchise has turned into.
2074807	2077108	It's roster update 2009 with new songs.
2077569	2079350	I see nothing here to report on.
2080729	2081450	Rihanna's in it.
2081610	2082151	Whoopee!
2084233	2087556	On the Wii One, you can now play on the balance board and shake your hips.
2088016	2089117	Yay!
2089478	2090158	That is new.
2090519	2091580	That is something legitimately new.
2091640	2092901	It is new and it is stupid.
2093582	2096825	I agree with the stupid part, but hey, it is new.
2097085	2109794	Then, not only that, not, okay, so, it would piss off fans enough that they didn't really do anything with the song list, that the song list sucks, and that, you know, the songs that they've just brought back a bunch of older songs and stuff like that.
2110674	2112095	That would be fine as it is.
2112535	2114517	Oh, but they didn't leave it there.
2115017	2120341	No, let's piss people off by taking Dynamite Rave and changing the lyrics to it, making it even worse.
2120361	2121481	I hate to tell you, they already did that.
2121521	2126745	Download the DDR for the iPhone, you can download Brilliant to you with lyrics, and it'll make your inner Bomani fanboy cry.
2128146	2129467	Well, it's still sad.
2130247	2131168	I'm just, I'm just, I've done.
2131188	2132729	That's how long it's been since I pleaded.
2132869	2133709	I've given up on Konami.
2133869	2135290	I've given up on these games.
2135671	2136411	I officially give up.
2136571	2139593	But Rob, how can they possibly innovate this game?
2139713	2141935	Can I, can I read, can I read this comment from chat real fast?
2142475	2148979	Comment from chat, Actdeft, 8 arrows for the 360 and PS3, Alpha Cananogram, did you try PS3 360 version with 8 arrow pad?
2149459	2150320	No, it was not on the floor.
2150540	2150700	Nope.
2151501	2154903	And they did have that, and Technomotion did it first.
2156548	2157148	You know what, though?
2157628	2158109	I don't care.
2158189	2159289	Technomotion was shit.
2159509	2163631	If you ever actually played Technomotion, it was fucking garbage, okay?
2163951	2168652	It's the one game everybody talked about back in the day, like, hey, I played Technomotion, because nobody had it.
2168752	2169032	Why?
2169113	2170313	Because it was fucking garbage.
2170833	2176335	So, okay, fine, if this is how DDR is going to innovate with the 8-arrow pad, whatever, let's see the goods.
2176455	2177635	Maybe I'll change my mind.
2177816	2180517	I'm not convinced adding four more arrows is going to make it any more fun.
2180537	2181737	It's not going to make it any more fun.
2182901	2183843	Oh, is that what you were going to tell me?
2183863	2184785	It's going to piss me off even more?
2184845	2185066	Yes.
2185848	2188995	Because it's not going to make it more fun because they don't understand.
2189055	2190097	They don't understand what...
2190748	2191989	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2214867	2216148	But people aren't doing that anymore.
2216268	2220129	And so now you're going after these new people instead of trying to recapture fans.
2220149	2221970	You already had your base right there.
2222190	2224651	If you kept them happy, you would be selling enough each year.
2225451	2225952	Newsflash.
2226112	2229553	Konami does not care about the DDR fan base because we all got old.
2229933	2232474	It's been 10 years and we're all too old to dance now.
2232814	2234535	So they are going after children.
2234835	2236076	I mean, that's what it is.
2237056	2238217	I hate to break it to you folks.
2238657	2240037	Konami does not care.
2240077	2240918	You're all 30 now.
2241198	2243199	Konami does not care about you anymore.
2244139	2265002	you're all gonna have kids and they want your kids playing DDR that's that's where it's at they need to remember is that we for all of us who grew up gamers we're not gonna buy shit for our kids we're not gonna buy them crappy games we're gonna buy them stuff that we'll want to play too but the thing I mean I was even thinking about this on the ride over here today like
2265883	2269644	The problem with Konami is they don't get what makes their games sell.
2270125	2275847	It's basically, you know, with DDR, it was all about the music and kind of the surprises.
2275947	2281289	Like with each different mix, they were adding something that was kind of new that was surprising.
2281349	2283530	Like the freeze arrows and stuff, that was kind of surprising for us.
2283550	2284690	There was a new element in there.
2284810	2285351	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2306144	2311529	They don't really want to do any of that, so what they're going to do is... I'm with you.
2311609	2315593	I don't even know what the hell they're calling this game, because it just said Dance Dance Revolution.
2315613	2315913	I don't care.
2315953	2318896	Yeah, I don't care either, but... I don't want to tell you what it's called.
2319837	2320357	Honestly.
2321038	2323340	As a journalist, or whatever... Yeah, right.
2323740	2324281	You know, whatever.
2324381	2326723	As a blogger, pod... Whatever the fuck I am.
2327464	2330607	As me, I don't want to tell you what it's called, because I don't care.
2332114	2334115	That's the point I've gotten to with these games.
2334595	2336136	I know people work very hard on them.
2336756	2339517	No, they don't work very hard on them.
2339557	2340437	I'm sorry.
2340878	2342478	I don't see it.
2342638	2342978	Here's the thing.
2343919	2346180	I think this chatter is absolutely right.
2346920	2350321	Sephiroth1215 says, no, they don't care anymore because Jason Enos is gone.
2350361	2351522	That's when DDR went downhill.
2351542	2351842	That's true.
2352182	2353603	That is exactly it.
2353723	2355243	I ran into him a few months ago, actually.
2355283	2356044	He works at EA now.
2356484	2357604	He doesn't work at EA anymore.
2357644	2359245	He also saw the games live.
2359685	2365390	I don't know if I can say what game he's been working on, but it's more casual games, I guess, is what he's doing now.
2365410	2366511	Maybe we'll get him on the show at some point.
2366551	2369173	I'll shoot an email or something.
2380723	2383885	But, yeah, you know, obviously that was huge.
2384085	2388728	Well, not just that, but the whole San Francisco office shut down, and that's where a lot of the fans were working during the steps.
2388788	2389829	I mean, that was huge.
2390129	2394092	I don't buy that, oh, well, you know, there's people working hard in this game.
2395583	2398606	Well, that's pretty sad then if this is the best you can do.
2398846	2407335	I mean, because really, all they did was just recycle the whole engine again, maybe change some assets to it, and just said, okay, what songs are we going to throw in there now?
2407695	2409257	Alright, here's the licensed songs we want.
2409317	2411819	Okay, let's see what else we can fill up the song list with.
2411859	2413461	Alright, so, look, moving on.
2413621	2415443	What's our game to advertise their music?
2415543	2417725	Dance Dance Revolution, awesome if you're seven.
2421388	2428974	By the way, if you need further proof that Konami does not care about the fans from ten years ago, look at what they did to poppin' music on the Wii, right?
2429354	2435278	They're relaunching poppin' music with this whole new control scheme and I guess song lists and stuff.
2435298	2437720	They say 150 classic tracks will be downloadable.
2438743	2439204	at launch.
2439824	2440946	Is this the new PS3 one?
2441046	2441246	Yes.
2442267	2444409	To be fair, I might check it out.
2445290	2452498	The nostalgia fanboy in me kind of is curious but it's a thin line with me right now that they're walking.
2453479	2453940	Thin line.
2454140	2455562	You want to see the nature of the train wreck?
2456202	2456463	Anyhow.
2458019	2460401	because I love DDR at its core.
2460461	2463483	That's why I get so impassioned about looking at where it's at now.
2463503	2468847	It's really frustrating when it really isn't that hard to turn this thing around, but they just don't want to do it.
2469727	2472709	Anyhow, Karaoke Revolution was also at Konami's booth.
2473409	2479793	I was surprised at how current the song list was, because they had, like, My Life Will Suck Without You, Just Dance by Lady Gaga.
2479813	2492061	They did have some current tracks, but honestly, to me, it felt like the same game we had on the PlayStation 2 without the American Idol stuff now, just with, you know, 720p, slightly souped-up engine.
2492241	2494202	I didn't see a lot of new stuff in there.
2494583	2497685	I imagine they're going to have the download store like every other music game now, but
2498485	2499085	www.DarkSakura.com
2520552	2547758	but I have a feeling Karaoke Revolution is going to be more of a robust jukebox by the time it's done which is kind of sad because Sony owns their own record label but when you look at what's available on SingStar it's very narrow especially when you consider that most of it is UK based music which isn't a bad thing they have some great music over there but not a lot of tunes that are going to be a big hit at parties here in the US because nobody's going to know them so that is a fair point
2548604	2559151	Anyhow, I think that's where Karaoke Revolution may win some people over because I think there's a lot of people who haven't taken the plunge into SingStar or Lips that might still be able to get brought on board with Karaoke Revolution.
2559331	2559672	I don't know.
2560272	2562013	I do have nice things to say about Konami.
2562594	2564575	One of my favorite games of the show was at their booth.
2565055	2571520	But before we get to that, I want to talk about one of my favorite games of the show, period, which was a music game, Beatles Rock Band.
2571760	2572160	Yes.
2572520	2573021	Oh, my God.
2573161	2574281	I saw the trailer for that.
2575302	2578084	Everybody's talking about that introduction and how amazing it is.
2578524	2582567	And let me tell you, the game itself looks just awesome.
2582647	2585289	Loki, I don't know, you want to talk about our experience at Beatles Rock Band?
2585509	2596156	Well, I mean, the thing everybody's harping on, harmonics and both Activision and that kind of stuff, and EA, is that they're taking these...
2597777	2598958	Thanks for watching!
2627333	2630576	But with Beatles Rock Band, they've redone the whole style of the game.
2630716	2635420	It's kind of this very stylized version of stuff.
2635860	2646489	I like the new things that they're doing now with the dreamscapes, which they kind of touched on a little bit in the trailers and the intro where you see some really trippy stuff that goes along with the songs.
2646909	2648511	I mean, that's really cool and different.
2649211	2654956	And the three-point harmonies are pretty cool in there and how you don't really have to...
2655636	2660360	Those stages for Here Comes the Sun and Octopus Gardens, those dream skates, that was amazing.
2660700	2661241	Amazing.
2662081	2663262	Yeah.
2663282	2667225	The three-part harmonies are pretty cool, how you can pick which one you want to do.
2669487	2676172	Just like the little stuff that they've added, little tweaks to make the game flow better and play better and is more fun.
2677653	2680715	That kind of stuff, focusing on the gameplay was really cool.
2681576	2683297	They're even going to support it with download content.
2683397	2683778	Obviously,
2684258	2684838	DarkSakura, Luke, Carameldansen
2714400	2720062	But they are working on different things Thank you Harmonix though for not putting out a Rock Band 3 this year Can I just say that?
2720102	2743428	Thank you for not showing Rock Band 3 However, at the same time you did show Rock Band Lego thing Which is kind of, I guess in a way that's cheating It's more for the pop stuff Like for the family type songs More pop kind of stuff And that was kind of neat looking But they are doing the same thing on the Activision side with Band Hero They just didn't really show much of it
2744693	2747895	Sephiroth 1215 says, Okay, so I say the Beatles can suck it.
2747955	2749176	Why should I buy this game?
2749376	2749937	Which is fair.
2750017	2752538	Not everybody respects the classic music stuff.
2753379	2754300	Music might not be for everybody.
2754900	2755540	But I'll tell you what.
2756801	2757302	Here's the thing.
2757322	2759943	I don't know if I overheard this at the booth or somebody told me this.
2759963	2762025	And I apologize if it was you and I'm not giving you credit.
2762385	2764106	But somebody said, You know what?
2764586	2765047	No matter...
2766921	2771185	No matter what kind of music you listen to, you hear these songs in the Beatles games.
2771625	2774788	You can't help but hum along or recognize these songs.
2775148	2779091	How often do you play Rock Band or Rock Band 2 and you're like, I've never heard that song before.
2779111	2780332	I can't do that song.
2780552	2782714	But with the Beatles songs, there's an awful lot of them.
2782995	2786177	You just know because they are so embedded in our culture.
2786257	2788739	You know a lot of these songs.
2788859	2789980	I think that's a big part of it.
2790241	2791281	Plus, for me...
2792262	2795964	The Rock Band Beatles, that's the way to do an artist's game.
2796124	2803848	It makes the Guitar Hero, Aerosmith games, and Van Halen games, and Metallica games look like cheap reskins.
2803888	2810271	Can you imagine if they did a Pink Floyd or something really trippy and stuff with a Rock Band type thing?
2810591	2817435	The same different stylized stuff, or like a Gorillaz game or something like that, same stylized...
2819090	2822592	They should change it up with each artist that they do it and then it would be really cool.
2824753	2826353	I just think this is the way to do it.
2826393	2835897	And by the way, if you don't understand what I meant earlier about how DDR needs to innovate itself and change, this is a perfect example.
2836517	2837078	You know what I mean?
2838358	2846962	My expectations going into this because of all the other music games I've seen lately were very low going in to look at the Beatles rock band and just kind of seeing that they've really made it like a Beatles experience.
2847682	2850844	I was like, wow, they know how to do it.
2851384	2855147	And honestly, I think other companies could be really learning a lot from this, and hopefully they are.
2855727	2856027	I don't know.
2857348	2863512	So I just, you know, it just, it felt, it's so hard for me to put into words.
2863612	2865333	It's something you have to see for yourself, I guess.
2865693	2870356	But it feels, it doesn't feel like a cheap reskinning or a cash-in type game.
2870416	2873638	It feels like a Beatles tribute.
2875018	2875359	It's great.
2878086	2880827	Yeah, so we watched some people play that, and it was cool.
2882388	2884649	Lego Rock Band, since that got brought up a minute ago.
2884989	2886410	I'm not as excited about that.
2886690	2889111	Now, that does look like a cheap reskinning of an old game.
2889751	2890711	I gotta be honest.
2890851	2903816	Yeah, it's gonna have the pop songs and all that stuff, which I suppose is gonna make or break the deal, and it's for the kids or what have you, but I literally was looking at Lego Rock Band going, this just looks like Rock Band 2 with Lego people.
2903916	2906138	I didn't really show off a lot of stuff that they were talking about though.
2906159	2915109	I remember with Lego Rock Band they said they were going to have kind of an adventure mode type stuff where you battle monsters and whatnot while playing music, that kind of stuff.
2915569	2917371	So that might be something kind of neat.
2917551	2918913	And the soundtrack really kind of...
2920808	2922530	would make or break this game, I think.
2923130	2925812	But right now, it's hard to say.
2925932	2926533	It just looks neat.
2927274	2930196	Because you can rock out into a Lego pirate ship and that kind of stuff.
2930917	2932058	I mean, that's just kind of neat.
2932378	2933158	I'd do that anyway.
2933519	2936401	In the end, really, you don't have to buy this game.
2936481	2938123	I mean, it's just optional.
2938223	2943747	If it's something that you think would be cool, cool, pick it up.
2945269	2947791	I don't think it's being sold in the bundles, so...
2949226	2949666	BlackWolf
2978112	2980033	in chat also kind of sent me this.
2980093	2983975	It's kind of like a food for thought, and I actually think it's a really interesting theory.
2984595	2985255	I want to read this.
2985716	2987796	The conspiracy behind Lego Rock Band.
2988117	2994019	Think about which music company's CEO felt that they aren't getting enough money from licensing for music games.
2994640	2997221	Now think about which company is publishing Lego Rock Band.
2997861	3002363	Now realize that download content for Lego Rock Band is not compatible with Rock Band 2.
3003144	3003964	Connect the dots.
3007398	3012680	That's an amazing thought, actually, and something I think a lot of people are overlooking.
3013101	3014381	It probably has a lot to do with it.
3014721	3015222	Absolutely.
3015802	3016242	Probably.
3016282	3017703	Isn't Warner putting out this?
3017723	3018303	Yes, it is.
3018963	3020664	Which record label was having a big stink?
3021244	3021544	Warner.
3023005	3024405	I think you've stumbled onto something, Bobby.
3024465	3024805	Good job.
3024845	3025306	Gold star.
3025826	3026626	You get a Scooby snack.
3027246	3029867	All right.
3030348	3033349	We share the radio night with you here on All Games for a reason, Bobby.
3033740	3034500	Thanks for watching!
3056429	3063590	and those folks that were thinking that, oh, Kensha Hall is lost and gone and what have you, you could still feel their presence there a little bit.
3064290	3076933	In the space that would have been taken up by Blizzard and some of these other companies that didn't come to E3 this year, they did have some of the old Kensha Hall, like DDR Game, you know, going back to the, you know, they're always there at E3 showing off their hard pads and stuff.
3077153	3078353	They were there doing their thing.
3078733	3084294	So, you know, they still have some of the old Kensha Hall companies are making a showing and the Indiecade, which was, you know, kind of cool.
3085979	3087505	Alright, what do we want to do?
3087586	3088410	Let's talk about...
3090307	3092468	Let's talk about some of the press conferences.
3092589	3092949	Why not?
3093029	3097052	I know you guys probably have heard all that you wanted to hear on the press conferences.
3097152	3101715	I just want to recap, give you guys a chance to give your input on the press conferences, what you thought.
3101855	3103956	I was following Twitter during a lot of this, too.
3104096	3104476	Were you?
3104697	3112282	Because I was at work, and of course I can't get on to watch any of the stuff, but I was getting feedback through Twitter, and there's some very interesting things.
3112342	3112902	I stayed home.
3113523	3115904	You know what pissed me off on the Twitter thing?
3116304	3119847	People that declared Microsoft won before Sony was done.
3120487	3120968	Shut up!
3121948	3124470	You know that all the good stuff- I mean, fanboy!
3124851	3126232	Hello, fanboy!
3126952	3128293	Sony was not even done yet.
3128353	3130615	Of course they left their feathers in the cap until the end.
3130875	3133837	Call me a Sony fanboy if you want, but go back to the archives of this show.
3133857	3135219	We've been highly critical of it in the past.
3135259	3135879	I left it open-ended.
3135919	3142604	I'm like, you know, Microsoft has won this unless Sony really brings something to the table that's, you know, outstanding.
3142624	3144586	Because if they brought what they brought last year-
3145683	3148045	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3162893	3191905	or everybody was a winner it really depended on what you were looking for this year in the games and honestly I think Microsoft had a lot of great ideas I think Sony had a lot of great implementations and I think Nintendo well they'll always have soccer moms Nintendo had a lot of last year oh and then this that's pretty much what we had from Nintendo
3192811	3194111	The chat room is speaking up.
3194431	3196932	Bobby, Actdeft, and some other folks saying the winners are gamers.
3197072	3198432	And that's true.
3198612	3201773	And I was commenting to Loki this as I was walking around the show floor.
3202173	3202994	I was like, you know what?
3203134	3205254	I haven't really played a shitty game yet this year.
3205694	3207815	Usually at E3, there's a real stinker of a game.
3207835	3209775	I'm kind of like, oh, I don't know about this game.
3209815	3210715	I take that back.
3210855	3211376	I did play.
3211396	3212196	Tara said the Beatles won.
3213496	3219961	Hey, reuniting who Microsoft did on stage, that was an impressive feat for their press conference, so I do give Microsoft props for that.
3220421	3221582	Loki, you did find a shitty game?
3221622	3231548	I did find a shitty game, and I can't remember what, it's like, it's a Konami game, surprise, but it was actually, it was like Zephyr the Elemental or something like that.
3232029	3242656	It was supposed to be, it was the one that they had, it was like Tornado something or other was the working title for it, and it's supposed to be like Katamari where you're this, you know, tornado, and you
3243574	3246817	Knock over things and you get bigger as you collect more things.
3246837	3248299	Isn't this game already on Xbox Live Marketplace?
3248339	3249419	It should be a Vornado game.
3249940	3251621	Yeah, basically, and it sucked.
3251962	3252742	It was boring.
3252903	3254684	So, no, I don't like that game.
3255024	3256606	That is my stinker game of V3.
3257386	3260789	I feel the need to say something nice about Konami because we've been giving them a hard time.
3260890	3265133	And to be fair, Konami did show a couple of great things at the show.
3265413	3267996	So before we get into the press conferences, to be fair, I want to say this.
3269039	3269760	Thanks for watching!
3284059	3284640	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
3304818	3311240	Like, you know, seeing that scene where the guy reaches in the toilet and pulls his hand up and he's got all the needles in it, that's just nasty, okay?
3311300	3320502	But there's people out there for the that's just nasty, and I gotta say, if you're a Fangoria-type person, Saw is probably going to appeal to you.
3320883	3321743	It's not terrible.
3321983	3326944	I still would never put any money into it, even if it was the best game on the planet, just so I don't support the franchise.
3328285	3329365	Seriously, that's how I feel.
3329733	3335935	Well, I'm trying to put the personal thoughts on that aside and just evaluate the game itself.
3339276	3343858	Considering it's a movie tie-in game, it looks like it's raising the bar on those a little bit.
3344118	3347039	I just don't think I can in good conscience say anything positive about it.
3348564	3359232	Alright, well, I do want to say though, a game that was incredible at Konami's booth that I played, and not quite my favorite game of the show, but just about my favorite game of the show was Silent Hill Shattered Memories on the Wii.
3360073	3363275	Oh my gosh, this game was great.
3363856	3370861	Especially, and I hate to say this, but for a Wii game, like it's, it was really, I love the concept.
3370881	3371661	It runs really smooth.
3371681	3375865	It runs smooth, it looks nice, you know, it doesn't look
3377153	3378235	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3393337	3394798	I love the way it controlled.
3395138	3400500	It was definitely kind of scary in parts, like when the things would jump out of the darkness on you.
3401020	3407143	I think the game is going to piss off hardcore fans of the Silent Hill because it looks like they've really changed up this first game.
3407503	3408144	But you know what?
3408704	3409244	I'm okay with it.
3409984	3413366	As someone who is casually a Silent Hill fan, I think it's pretty cool.
3414387	3415848	I like some of the changes they've made.
3416889	3417970	It's engrossing.
3418090	3418810	It's scary.
3419291	3423615	It's going to be a lot of fun, and it's a good non-party Wii game.
3424075	3424595	Hooray!
3425056	3429720	This is what I have to say for people who fuss just because of changes.
3430561	3433363	Without change, we'd have stagnation, and with stagnation, we'd have death.
3434364	3439028	So if you want the franchise to die, then don't look forward to any changes in it.
3439768	3440029	Don't be...
3441786	3442887	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3459895	3460676	She was kind of a hoe.
3461276	3462437	Honestly, whatever.
3462457	3463757	The game was fun.
3463817	3468760	The changes are being made based on how you answer some of this personality stuff.
3468800	3470621	So it kind of changes it.
3470701	3478406	It's almost like how different things manifest based on the characters' intentions and desires and that kind of stuff.
3478426	3479767	There's some pretty personal stuff in there.
3479787	3481027	I remember Silent Hill 2.
3481108	3482608	The little girl never saw any of the...
3483769	3484950	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3502970	3504552	Have you ever roleplayed during sex?
3504592	3506454	And all these very personal questions.
3506735	3510839	And of course, as I was taking it, I was trying to make myself sound like the most messed up person on the planet.
3512261	3514023	So, you know, I'm curious.
3514143	3517147	I didn't really see what impact that's going to have on the game, but it looked interesting.
3517748	3517848	So...
3519039	3521460	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3534588	3536369	Unfolded Raptor talking about the Saw game.
3536389	3543951	There is one where you have to close stalled doors and read the backwards number in the bloodstained mirror in the room and put in the combination for the lock in order to get to the next room.
3543991	3548313	Yeah, that puzzle was in the demo and it was an interesting puzzle.
3548453	3550733	It was kind of a neat little gameplay mechanic.
3550773	3551394	I thought it was cool.
3552234	3557676	GS68 says, well, they didn't show gore, I think he meant to say, but they showed 3D stuff and some disgusting shit.
3558076	3561437	And that's why I don't think in the end I could actually play the Saw game.
3562369	3571771	But, you know, the parts I saw where people weren't losing looked just fine, but I don't think I'd be able to play the game myself.
3572352	3574572	Isn't that weird, to kind of say that about a video game?
3574912	3575152	Yes.
3575632	3578913	It might be nice for those of you that are into that kind of thing, but not me.
3580554	3581734	Whatever sinks your battleship.
3582174	3582694	Exactly.
3583774	3585835	I'm sorry, GS68 wasn't talking about the Saw game.
3587487	3590189	Oh god, he was talking about Faname 2009 Hentai Room.
3590369	3591090	Oh, sorry about that.
3591130	3593492	I was looking up the notes there.
3594853	3597534	I'm sure the Saw game has some pretty disgusting shit in it too.
3597554	3598455	In fact, I know it does.
3598535	3599676	I did see some disgusting shit.
3599696	3606041	Real quick, before we go on to the conferences, I was going to mention some of the other announcements from Konami real quick.
3607722	3610644	Of course, some stuff that actually didn't make the keynotes.
3611745	3616168	Kojima Productions announced Metal Gear Solid or Metal Gear Arcade.
3618191	3618451	Okay.
3618791	3619612	Which is kind of neat.
3619932	3628955	And they also, you may remember there was that Castlevania type game that they were previewing that wasn't really Castlevania.
3629015	3630335	Well, it ended up being Castlevania.
3630655	3632996	And it's actually being done by Kojima, which is pretty cool.
3633056	3633737	I know.
3633917	3635197	I heard about that.
3635217	3636097	That's going to be cool.
3636137	3637518	And Patrick Stewart is a voice in it.
3637987	3640049	That makes it infinitely cool.
3640149	3643151	Yes, so that was definitely a big yay from Konami.
3643511	3645513	Do you wonder if he's going to be Dracula?
3646093	3646434	I don't know.
3646454	3648255	Could you imagine Patrick Stewart as Dracula?
3648675	3651017	I hope this is a game that's showing up on the floor next year.
3651258	3652559	That would be fantastic.
3652579	3654800	Because he can do the scary voice.
3654820	3658643	Patrick Warburton as one of the Belmonts.
3660024	3660625	That would be funny.
3662393	3664134	I hope we don't get the die monster.
3664194	3672117	And then of course, to kind of go back to music games, also Konami announced that they are bringing over that poppin' music for Wii with no controller.
3672217	3679180	Once again, really not... Meaning it's not poppin' music like you folks that have been following Konami for 10 years will think it is.
3679360	3680541	So don't... You know what?
3680701	3682882	Do yourself a favor, hardcore Bomani fans.
3683302	3686563	Don't think of this game as poppin' music because you are just going to be disappointed.
3686864	3687464	And don't buy it.
3688376	3692020	Well, it's not fair to say that until I've actually had my hands on it playing it.
3692240	3697205	So I'm not going to say that, but I'm going to say don't think of it as poppy music because you're only going to set yourself up for disappointment.
3697766	3697986	Yeah.
3699648	3700949	But Lorde's a shadow looker.
3703086	3703947	That's a Castlevania game.
3704607	3707449	Alright, so let's talk about press conferences here.
3707469	3708389	We're an hour into the show.
3708409	3710130	We haven't even touched on a single press conference yet.
3710170	3712432	So let's talk about the big press conferences so far.
3712452	3713692	Where do we want to start?
3713712	3714433	How about Nintendo?
3714453	3716074	I guess we were ragging on Nintendo a little bit.
3716094	3716734	We'll start with them.
3717655	3718935	Yay, I like ragging on Nintendo.
3719035	3719916	Some of the things that they mentioned.
3719936	3721697	Well, not all the news was bad out of Nintendo.
3721737	3723678	I mean, certainly Metroid Other M. How about this?
3723898	3727440	Team Ninja teams up with Nintendo to put out the next Metroid game.
3727460	3728921	But Team Ninja's lacking.
3729482	3731403	The only good announcement out of
3732634	3733755	Out of their press conference.
3733935	3738317	And seriously, if they hadn't announced this, I would have had no hope for them.
3740038	3744041	Well, this was definitely the thing to cater to the hardcore gamers.
3744221	3747223	Yes, it's a good example of how to revitalize your franchise.
3747463	3748864	Have someone else do it.
3749364	3751205	But we don't have Itagaki.
3752987	3753688	Samus will have boob mechanics
3768206	3772931	Prime was alright, but yeah, I was missing my 2D Metroid and this is going to give it to me.
3773051	3774853	Prime did not do it for me.
3775173	3779377	I just couldn't get in the Prime and corruptions, you know, it looked kind of dumb.
3780879	3781700	But this looks awesome.
3782000	3784723	This looks like something I could actually play and would want to play.
3786069	3786549	Thanks for watching!
3808137	3808717	It's stupid.
3809017	3810378	You know why it's stupid?
3810478	3812919	It's because it's just porting basically the game from the DS.
3813359	3828744	And yeah, I know it's a new game and stuff, but really, unless you're really into party games and really into playing this with four people at once, which, that's fine, because the Wii is for a lot of people that want to do party games and stuff like that.
3828984	3832065	But I just couldn't see myself breaking this out at a party and playing this game.
3832425	3835266	It'd be like the regular new Super Mario Bros.
3835426	3836526	I played through it myself.
3838188	3838688	And that's it.
3838868	3842630	This game, if I play through it myself, I'm not going to really get anything out of it.
3842890	3843710	And that's the problem.
3844870	3846631	Yeah, I played this on the show floor, like I said.
3846671	3847351	And it was fun.
3847831	3849172	It's neat.
3849192	3851853	Playing with four people, it was a lot of fun and very competitive.
3852193	3853473	But don't be mistaken, folks.
3853754	3855994	This is another party game on the Wii.
3856735	3857835	In Mario's clothing.
3858475	3860336	And don't call this New Super Mario Bros.
3860356	3861896	because you just ported this shit.
3862037	3863177	It's not new.
3863417	3864297	It's ported.
3864397	3865418	Slightly recycled.
3867142	3868263	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3888473	3889174	Oh, awesome.
3889194	3890294	That's not really the focus.
3890675	3891635	That's very nice.
3892076	3893137	Here's the thing that I didn't really get.
3893157	3897060	To be fair, that wasn't really the focus of the demo they were showing or not really the focus of the game.
3897480	3903865	My opinion of what she said was that's not really the focus of the game because if there was a single player mode, they would have shown it somewhere.
3904085	3905126	But that's not what they were showing.
3905146	3906947	They were showing this four player party thing.
3907507	3909989	And strangely enough, it's not online.
3911010	3914292	They had the perfect opportunity to have a fun little online game and it's not online.
3914312	3922939	I love it because, as Bobby was saying in his show, because the processing power of the Wii can't handle online with this type of game.
3923419	3925981	It can't handle online with this type of game.
3927162	3927362	What?
3928680	3930221	Didn't Brawl do that?
3930841	3931182	What?
3932583	3934304	What the hell was this one they just had on the GameCube?
3934344	3934904	Smash Bros.
3935044	3935705	Yeah, Smash Bros.
3935725	3936005	Brawl.
3936225	3938526	Wii, yeah.
3938766	3939507	That was online.
3939547	3941028	It was laggy sometimes, so they did it.
3942049	3943990	Did this other game have much more than that?
3944010	3944230	Smash Bros.
3944250	3944750	Brawl, yeah.
3947132	3948753	They can't handle online?
3950216	3951736	Then you need better programmers!
3951917	3954617	I'm sorry, but it's a 2D game, okay?
3955077	3961319	It's a 2D game with very low polys, and you can't handle four people online?
3962800	3968301	Mario Kart can handle four people online, and that's way more complex than this game.
3968962	3970582	Why can't you handle four people online?
3970722	3972903	Oh, I know why, because you don't want to embrace online.
3972923	3974443	That's really the reason behind it.
3974783	3979885	It's not because it's a technical limitation, because if it was a technical limitation, I'm sure you'd find a way around it.
3980327	3981528	And it's a personal limitation.
3982348	3987810	It's because the person that's going to buy this game isn't probably really into online.
3987830	3989551	They're probably into soccer.
3989691	3991512	And they probably are a mom.
3995152	3998796	AlphaKananaGram in chat says, Rob, they said that is the game.
3999096	4001419	With extra players joining in and leaving at any time.
4001479	4003021	So yeah, that is the game.
4003321	4004502	That's exactly what I'm saying.
4004622	4005323	Don't be fooled.
4005383	4006384	This is a party game.
4006725	4007786	At least Smash Bros.
4007866	4010849	Brawl had a single player mode that was pretty extensive and fun.
4011650	4018237	All I'm saying is that if there is, you know, to be fair to Nintendo, if there is a single player fun bonanza in here, I just have yet to see it.
4018657	4022241	So if you are thinking you're excited about this game, that's cool.
4022581	4024823	I hope you have friends to play it with regularly.
4025404	4030349	When I saw this one, they were like, oh, we have new Super Mario Brothers now on the Wii coming this holiday.
4030369	4032070	I was like, whoop-dee-shit.
4033552	4035514	There's also people, though, that I just hope you have friends.
4036806	4041027	It's like, you know, oh, we've been waiting for another Mario Brothers game on the Wii.
4041148	4042648	Woo!
4043088	4044629	New Super Mario Brothers.
4045069	4045649	Awesome!
4045949	4047090	No, I'm sorry, that wasn't awesome.
4047190	4052471	TigerClaw in chat says, yeah, Nintendo's forgetting that there are many of us who don't know people in the neighborhood that own the same system.
4052531	4053852	So yeah, you're pretty much all alone.
4055017	4055477	Super Mario Galaxy 2
4078604	4079605	Thank you for watching!
4103786	4104847	Oh, Yoshi's in it now!
4105067	4106128	Oh, my mistake!
4106308	4107009	Yoshi's in this.
4107069	4108470	Well, obviously it's a sequel now.
4110172	4113574	But, I mean, really, they didn't do that much to it.
4113715	4120841	I mean, whereas, you know, like Super Mario World, you know, Super Mario World 1 and 2, I mean, those were very different games.
4120901	4122282	Yeah, they were really different games.
4122442	4125645	I mean, granted, World 2 was kind of annoying, but, um...
4128643	4129844	Really with the crying baby?
4130625	4132929	Oh, just mute the damn TV if it gets to you.
4133189	4135994	Or don't suck so much and keep losing the baby.
4136114	4137195	Then you won't hear it cry.
4139278	4144006	That's what Mario Galaxy 2 needs, a crying baby on the back of Yoshi.
4145779	4146960	Touch Fuzzy, Get Dizzy
4175874	4176154	All right.
4176935	4179638	Interlogic in chat says, okay, there's a lot of yelling going on.
4179678	4182241	How about switching to a subject that can let everyone relax?
4182361	4183623	How about we use our inside voices?
4183663	4185104	Maybe 3DO talk.
4186265	4186626	Okay.
4186986	4190170	Well, just for you, Interlogic, let me ask Loki about this little gem here.
4190270	4196096	One big thing that Nintendo had to unveil at their press conference, the Wii Vitality Sensor.
4196456	4196476	I...
4198092	4200494	Thank you for watching!
4219810	4220110	What?
4220811	4223114	Thank you, Nintendo, for giving us shit we don't need.
4223174	4225536	Like, they're all... It's going to take the gaming to the next level.
4225937	4228119	For geriatrics, maybe.
4228700	4229300	Seriously.
4229380	4230922	It's a heart monitor for Wii Fit.
4231723	4233985	Dude, I can give myself an electrocardiogram on the Wii now.
4234005	4234406	No, seriously.
4234446	4236148	They're like, it's going to allow you...
4237489	4238049	DarkSakura.com
4258450	4266094	I'm sorry, all they're going to do is come out with another game that's going to have some mini-games based on this accessory, and then that's it.
4266234	4269575	Imagine the WarioWare with the Wii Vitality Sensor.
4271936	4274037	Some of the mini-games stop beating.
4279000	4280440	I'm sorry, it's going to be dumb.
4280721	4287244	And what also makes it dumb is they should have done this Bluetooth or something like that so that you can utilize it with...
4288769	4289750	Thanks for watching!
4307893	4314818	How long may I ask before we hear about an injury where someone has inserted their penis into the Wii Vitality Sensor?
4315058	4317640	Because I bet you anything someone will do that.
4318060	4325565	Because if it's got some sort of way to attach to something, someone's going to try to stick their penis in there.
4326025	4327346	And that's what's going to happen.
4328867	4330608	That's immediately what I thought when I saw it.
4330648	4333310	I'm like, how long is it going to take before someone sticks their penis in that?
4333470	4334631	I know that's going to happen.
4337702	4339043	I think you just made Rob hurt.
4341044	4341484	I hurt.
4363977	4367420	Oh, Grandma made Jello tonight.
4368000	4370061	How long before someone puts their dick in it?
4370862	4371582	Exactly.
4372623	4373524	Mashed potatoes?
4373824	4376426	See, now all we need is to talk about farting and we'll be cool.
4376506	4381209	And then I'd like to finish off the rest of their wonderful conference.
4381469	4385972	They talked about Wii Sports Resort, and they talked about the new games they're in, which are fine.
4385992	4386273	They're neat.
4388594	4389875	WeMotionPlus WeFitPlus
4416527	4420148	and some online data sharing or something like that.
4420328	4421468	Whoop-dee-doo!
4421948	4422388	But guess what?
4422408	4429350	They're going to have new bundles and people are going to be dumb and not realize that it's actually the same game they just bought and they're going to buy it all over again.
4430910	4434470	Frisbee says, now that's what I call touch generation games.
4437871	4441812	Although, Rez with the Wii Vitality Sensor might be kind of fun.
4443561	4445583	All right, other things at a Nintendo's press conference.
4445663	4446803	Wii Sports Resort.
4446864	4448505	I actually played this game on the floor.
4448625	4452147	I played the archery game, which was, you know.
4453588	4454829	What can I say about Wii Sports?
4454889	4458251	It's the type of thing that's fun at a party when I have friends over.
4458311	4459532	Hey, let's play Wii Sports.
4459572	4465536	Let's have a little competition, you know, because we're at a party and drinking, so we can't go outside and play, so let's do some Wii Sports.
4465956	4468557	But I don't think I would ever play this by myself.
4468618	4469278	Like, hey, I'm bored.
4469298	4470399	I want to shoot archery.
4470839	4472420	Did you ever figure out?
4473999	4475940	What exactly would MotionPlus does?
4476481	4479663	It looks like it just allows motion detection in more places.
4479943	4487689	I mean, to be honest, the archery thing did feel natural, and I think with the controller they have today, it would have been a little bit shaky.
4487709	4493473	Because we remember way back, we did play archery in DECA Sports.
4493533	4495594	Yeah.
4496195	4497476	I don't know if you remember that that much.
4497536	4502419	Not really, but I seem to recall there was more, I don't know, it just seemed more precision.
4502679	4502999	I don't know.
4503939	4504359	Thanks for watching!
4522176	4523096	You know, but whatever.
4523717	4525637	That's part of the give and take of E3.
4525978	4528999	You know, so I can't base my entire judgment of this game off of what I played.
4529379	4537062	However, you know, again, I didn't see anything that made me go, oh, you know, I need this game.
4537582	4539403	Red Seal 2, though, looked awesome.
4540103	4540403	How so?
4540443	4541744	I didn't really check that out.
4541964	4544125	It ran really smooth, 60 frames per second.
4544145	4547846	The Wii Motion Plus and sword tracking really worked.
4548767	4549507	And it looked fun.
4550167	4551428	Unlike Red Seal 1, which...
4552645	4555808	DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
4569079	4570439	More for people who don't already own it.
4570919	4573500	I can't see myself... I mean, it really depends on the price point.
4573540	4575401	I didn't see how much they were going to charge for this game.
4575501	4582422	I can't see myself paying a lot of money for it if it's not going to give me anything that special, if that makes sense.
4582522	4583663	It's just more minigames.
4583843	4584863	What if they make Wii LiPo?
4586183	4586924	I'd probably buy it.
4587044	4588164	Or Wii Gastric Bypass.
4588888	4589709	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4615189	4617630	Depends how good that online functionality is.
4617750	4622052	But based on what I saw, I don't really see anything that justifies $40.
4624293	4626454	$20 maybe, but I highly doubt that's what they're charging for it.
4627095	4627995	It's not going to be $20.
4628555	4629056	Exactly.
4631977	4632457	Let's see.
4632817	4634958	What other kind of stuff was announced at Nintendo press conference?
4634978	4636799	That's pretty much all that I have on my list.
4636939	4642062	Other things announced that didn't quite make their press conference.
4643072	4643613	New colors.
4644054	4644675	That's right.
4644795	4645796	It was about time.
4646237	4650223	Now, Japan, during the summer, will be getting a black Wii.
4651141	4654922	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
4680250	4681071	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4698752	4699833	I didn't really know what they were.
4701053	4702054	Oh, other announcements.
4702454	4706836	Obviously, DSi was getting Facebook support as well.
4707776	4713379	They're going to allow you to upload pictures you take with the DSi camera to Facebook.
4713579	4715860	As if there wasn't enough crap on my feed.
4716894	4717915	I hope I can block it.
4733348	4734049	WarioWare DIY WarioWare
4755571	4763813	They've also announced Flipnote Studios for DSi this summer, which is also the motion notepad that they have in Japan right now.
4764773	4769854	And New Mario and Luigi RPG, well, was it March of the Minis again?
4769894	4772374	They're going to do another Mario vs. Donkey Kong game.
4772434	4775255	I think that was going to be a DSi-only app or something like that.
4775675	4776655	Oh, that was the one that came out.
4776895	4778515	And it's out tomorrow or something.
4778815	4779536	Didn't they announce that?
4779816	4780636	Something like that, yeah.
4780796	4781396	It's out now.
4782276	4783157	It was a download game.
4783237	4783897	I don't have a DSi.
4784118	4784998	Can I say this real quick?
4785018	4787200	The chat room really wants us to mention Golden Sun.
4787581	4791164	I saw a couple other people mentioning that before and SSJ100Mac kind of sums it up here.
4791844	4796809	I got excited for a split second when they said at their press conference, an old franchise that was once gone is coming back.
4797189	4799871	I thought maybe Mother 3 or Kid Icarus.
4801032	4802033	I saw that too.
4802053	4802614	That was funny.
4803234	4804535	Oh yeah, they're going to announce Mother 3.
4804595	4806657	Oh, nope, they're not.
4806937	4809319	Uh-uh.
4810194	4812375	Alright, anything else you want to say about Nintendo's press conference?
4814375	4817196	Um... It still sucked.
4817376	4822437	Now, theRobD wants to point out, I'm really excited, I loved Golden Sun, this is a good thing, a very good thing.
4822498	4832040	Yeah, I mean, the Golden Sun games are fun, but you have to admit, there's some folks that are going to feel that huge sense of disappointment, like, oh my god, I've been waiting forever for Kid Icarus, here it is!
4832800	4834441	Oh, Golden Sun, fuck you.
4834861	4835501	Thank you for watching!
4850507	4853070	Classic Game of the Week Classic Game of the Week
4872918	4879283	So DarkSakura, amongst all these newfangled games we're talking about, the three, what's an old classic that folks should be revisiting?
4879684	4881125	I went for old and obscure.
4882686	4888171	It's actually a game I've mentioned on the show before, which is to date one of my favorite shoot-em-up games.
4889492	4898580	It's called Ginga Fukei Densetsu Sapphire, which is one of the last games that came out on the PC Engine, on the Duo.
4899181	4900422	Oops, I cut it off accidentally.
4900462	4900683	Sorry.
4900703	4901183	Here we go again.
4901203	4902465	Here's a little clip of the game.
4904106	4906329	I love the music in it.
4906369	4912576	But it is one of the arcade CD-ROM games that came out.
4912996	4920744	So that means, of course, with my Turbo Duo, I can't play it, which I do own a copy of the game.
4921645	4932968	But it's also one of the few games towards the end of the PC Engine's life that had an actual real 3D in it in the form of the bosses and some of the enemies in the game.
4933648	4941970	But it actually came out recently on PSP as part of the Galaxy Fraulein Collection, which is actually something I plan on ordering very soon.
4942450	4944131	Because, again, this is one of my favorite games.
4944791	4948394	And if you want to find it on eBay, good luck.
4949794	4953817	This game will actually end up costing more than Dracula X does.
4953857	4956539	This one will go for easily 400 bucks.
4957139	4957580	I've seen it.
4959321	4962283	But anyway, it's basically just a standard, you know, shoot-em-up.
4962563	4968907	You can upgrade your weapons, and you have your little option things hanging out with you, and you just basically go through the game and shoot stuff.
4969830	4975694	Now, I typed the name of the game in chat, but they would like to hear it pronounced once again, because it is not an easy name, because it is a Japanese game.
4976495	4980678	Oh, it's Ginga Fuke Densetsu Sapphire.
4980698	4983040	There you go.
4983750	4988232	If you want a translation of the name, that is Galaxy Policewoman Legend Sapphire.
4989533	4989953	It came out in 1995.
4990053	4992134	It is a Hudson Soft game.
4992895	4995136	One of the... Oh god, I love Hudson.
4995856	5007282	But also, one of the things about the game, and this is actually something that I've seen in several reviews, and I'm going to repeat this one from one little review, that says...
5008702	5014047	Really, the game is more of overcoming the game's mechanics rather than mastering them.
5014708	5019793	So, really, a lot of playing in the game is hit or miss, whether or not you make it through.
5020013	5023997	If the game has it out for you, it's going to have it out for you.
5024457	5025578	Where you have actual real 3D...
5026979	5028139	Oh, that's kind of neat.
5028419	5034081	Like, this boss looks like, imagine one of those giant chemistry molecules they have hanging in chemistry class.
5034401	5037702	Like, it's like one of those things, but it's actually like rotating around and spinning around.
5037762	5040882	So, for, you know, a game from 95, that's a pretty cool depth.
5041242	5041543	Yeah.
5042023	5054746	And it was, it really is, though, even though it's really a little bit on the hard side, your bosses are so easy in this one because they are so predictable in their patterns.
5055626	5055766	And
5058118	5065281	The whole part, though, is trying to get around how slow your ship really is.
5066142	5069503	Because the ship, as you'll see, the ship does move really slowly.
5070124	5072725	And you have a relatively large hitbox.
5075086	5077767	The area that will count as you being hit.
5080751	5082753	This game really doesn't look easy.
5083133	5083914	It does look very hard.
5084715	5086417	Have you actually had a chance to play this, DarkSakura?
5086517	5094747	Yeah, my friend, actually she lives in Japan right now, she has an original of this, which is how I got my copy of it.
5095768	5096269	But, um...
5097450	5107616	She, um, she's got a PC Engine Duo and arcade card, so we went over to her house and she said, okay, play this game, okay, play this game, okay, play this game.
5108376	5111138	And Sapphire was just like, oh my god!
5111638	5120543	It was like, this one and another shooter, Psychic Storm, were the ones that I played the most, but mostly because in Psychic Storm it sounds like they're saying I get pissed off instead of saying Psychic Storm.
5121043	5121804	But that's another game.
5122384	5130449	But see, isn't that... Really, you should post the link to this in the chat room because it's something that you really have to see.
5130890	5134132	It's just a fantastic, fantastic shooter.
5135813	5140696	And, you know, I'm going to actually do an eBay search right now and see if I can find out how much it's going for.
5141356	5141636	All right.
5141977	5145699	Well, let me just go ahead and wrap this up and say there it is again, your classic game of the week.
5145979	5147460	And, Jamie, you might have to correct me here.
5147901	5150142	Ginga, Foukei, Densetsu, Sapphire.
5150262	5150842	Not bad.
5151243	5151563	All right.
5152878	5154559	There it is, your classic game of the week.
5157001	5160044	We are going to take a break and come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
5160104	5165708	When we come back from a quick break, we have not even touched on Sony's press conference and Microsoft's press conference.
5165728	5167470	And believe me, there's a lot to talk about there.
5167770	5169171	We're also going to cover some other news.
5169471	5173034	We still need to get the release dates, the FUs of the week, and the mailbag.
5173074	5174816	So we have a busy Part B still coming up.
5175076	5176037	We're going to get to it all.
5176217	5177158	And your phone calls.
5177258	5178739	My God, we're going to be here until 11 tonight.
5179179	5179500	No, we'll...
5180060	5187958	we'll try and wrap it all up in just a little bit we're going to take a quick break to rest our voices and so forth we will be back in just a little bit with more of Orange Lounge Radio
5194950	5201775	And welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio on our 326th episode for this June the 7th of 2009.
5202535	5212201	As a reminder, we do tape live on Sunday nights over at allgames.com right after the Bobby Blackwolf show, which is about 6 o'clock Pacific Standard Time, 9 o'clock Eastern Standard Time.
5212242	5215243	Unless it's a special night, maybe Bobby will go a little longer.
5215284	5219887	We'll start more like 6.15 as tonight was because it was Bobby's 200th episode.
5219987	5221087	Quite an accomplishment.
5221147	5222108	So congratulations.
5222128	5222769	Thank you for watching!
5244525	5247546	All right, anyhow, we're going to get back and do some E3 rundown.
5247586	5249206	Again, unscripted tonight.
5249586	5256248	Just kind of talking and playing around, talking about some of the various events that have happened at E3.
5256348	5259849	And I guess we're going to talk about Sony's press conference, if that's all right.
5260149	5265311	Before we do that, I was going to mention a few more things about Nintendo stuff that I saw.
5265631	5268752	I got to see Sin and Punishment 2, which looked awesome.
5269012	5269252	You know...
5269932	5270933	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5299707	5300788	I don't even know what that looked like.
5300848	5301528	It was kind of weird.
5302249	5304510	But they had some other stuff that they were announcing.
5305270	5309053	Fossil Fighters for the DS, which I actually know that's coming out in August.
5309833	5317017	And a new Professor Layton game and Pokemon Mystery Dungeon Explorers of the Sky.
5318398	5319139	All sorts of stuff.
5319419	5321140	So that was kind of neat.
5322100	5322381	And then...
5324301	5329385	I think... Oh yeah, Sin and Punishment 2 is supposed to be coming out quarter one of next year.
5329566	5330206	So that's kind of cool.
5331868	5332148	All right.
5332328	5333489	Are we okay to move on to Sony now?
5333669	5334009	Sure.
5334069	5338093	Let's talk Sony, because Sony definitely had a lot of big news out of their press conference.
5338673	5341676	And a very interesting story I have about Sony.
5341896	5344919	Loki, you missed day one of E3, which is when the Sony press conference was going on.
5345299	5350383	From what I understand, day one of E3 was not originally supposed to start until noon, but it ended up starting at 10 a.m.,
5351144	5352305	DarkSakura, DarkDeft, Drew, Carameldansen
5381118	5408710	And I wanted to check that out But obviously there's some big announcements at Sony What's also cool and a lot of people may not know because they were at Sony's press conference God of War 3 as you know was playable at the show floor in Sony's booth But during the press conference all the monitors were turned off So you actually couldn't play God of War 3 until the walkthrough was done But you knew it was going to be there because they had the God of War 3 sign up And they already had a line forming But just nobody could play it until the press conference was actually over
5409170	5412413	But I did get to see some of Sony's press conference at the booth, which is kind of cool.
5412913	5414114	And to see some of their big announcements.
5414154	5416216	Of course, God of War 3 being one of them.
5416696	5418537	I'm not huge on the God of War series.
5418577	5420479	You know, I certainly respect what it is.
5420559	5423781	It's just I don't have time to play everything as none of us do.
5423842	5426323	And this is just one of the big series I haven't gotten around to.
5426724	5428105	Loki, I don't know if you're big on these games.
5428805	5429205	I like them.
5429225	5429745	They're okay.
5430026	5435207	It's nothing really innovative for God of War 3 other than, you know, obviously the nicer graphics now with the PlayStation 3.
5436067	5438368	And it is a little bit more detailed in the gore.
5438968	5446871	In fact, there is one point where they had slashed open, I believe, a minotaur and just like his organs were spilling out.
5446951	5448511	And you got to see those organs spill out.
5448851	5449572	So that was kind of cool.
5449592	5449952	I like organs.
5453239	5455766	If you're a fan of God of War, you're going to love this game.
5456067	5459797	It's just the same type of gameplay that you can normally expect from them.
5460868	5461449	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5484315	5485075	Which is kind of nice.
5485396	5485696	We'll see.
5485756	5486576	For now, they do.
5487036	5487377	We'll see.
5488317	5491279	Because you know how usually they dub over the Japanese lips.
5491519	5497162	Do you remember when X-2 came out, they re-synced the animation to the voices, too?
5497422	5499803	It would be nice if they did that for XIII, but I'm not counting on it.
5500044	5504806	And they re-did a lot of the CG to match voice.
5504966	5510149	And they completely re-did two whole scenes in that game for the American audience.
5511150	5513471	So it makes sense they do something like that with XIII.
5514562	5523405	So obviously this game's on its way out, and they did confirm this for a 2010 release, and it was nice to see some of it actually getting, you know, some more of it shown to get to know a little more of the story.
5523425	5524645	They showed Odin, which is pretty cool.
5524765	5526666	Yes, and some of the summons, which is pretty awesome.
5527106	5537429	But then a huge bombshell dropped right after that at the show, and what's interesting about it is that then he started talking about how Final Fantasy XIV was exclusive to the PlayStation 3.
5538069	5542791	Before even showing the trailer, he talked about, I'm here to announce that Final Fantasy XIV is going to be exclusive on the PlayStation 3.
5543191	5543872	Final Fantasy XIV Online
5560732	5561693	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5577785	5578405	but different.
5578725	5587427	Actually, 1UP of all places actually had a pretty in-depth talk on Final Fantasy XIV and some of the things they've talked about, they have learned a lot of their lessons from the prior game.
5587747	5590848	This game is going to be launched globally, Final Fantasy XIV.
5591168	5593649	It's going to be on the PlayStation 3 and the PC.
5593869	5594689	It's going to be on both.
5594709	5595889	They're also talking about bringing it to the 360.
5595929	5598010	They're thinking about it.
5598350	5600290	I suppose, but nothing's for sure yet.
5600870	5604731	I'll probably be playing it on the PC no matter what.
5604811	5606672	I can't imagine playing it on a console.
5606752	5607052	I don't know.
5607712	5609193	I really wish they hadn't announced this.
5609973	5610273	Why?
5610313	5613514	Because you're just watching your life get sucked away, right?
5613534	5614114	Oh, no.
5614735	5618936	I seriously wanted to cry standing in the booth watching that trailer.
5618956	5625138	And it wasn't because of the trailer itself, but it's because I just saw the next few years of my life wilting away at this game.
5625158	5626599	Because we all know that's what's going to happen.
5626879	5627979	No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
5628580	5632221	This will happen to me because I have something far better to look forward to.
5632768	5633528	Star Trek Online
5659167	5664991	So, it's like, it sounds like some of the biggest flaws of Final Fantasy XI have the potential of being addressed in this.
5665331	5669934	This could be huge, but of course, I don't want to set the bar too high, or I might be disappointed.
5670494	5673536	So, I'm... And of course, the chat room wants to know... Whoa.
5673576	5677238	Maybe this is good music for that question.
5677278	5677378	No.
5677698	5682101	Amazatsuma wants to know in chat, Sky, Final Fantasy XIV or Star Trek?
5684056	5684816	What a tough question.
5715245	5716987	and one is about swords and weapons.
5717007	5720870	But they did have those ships that they were flying around and shooting each other and stuff like that.
5720890	5722952	So you're going to get sucked into this MMO, Loki.
5722992	5723893	I don't know.
5724173	5725094	I don't have time.
5725535	5726416	The wife's not going to let you.
5726436	5727537	You've got kids to raise now.
5727877	5728477	Who cares?
5731040	5731901	You can get a sitter.
5733784	5734745	I'll let them play too.
5735266	5738471	SSJ100 Matt in chat says, why can't we have our cake and pie at the same time?
5738591	5739172	Exactly.
5739573	5742097	Haven't you ever heard of getting ice cream and cake?
5742397	5746324	Honestly, what'll probably end up happening is I don't know if I'll actually play this game because I'll probably just want time.
5746744	5748347	It'll be a time factor.
5749212	5750653	But I am very excited about this.
5750973	5755477	And honestly, I would say that this right here was the biggest surprise of the show.
5755797	5757018	No one saw this coming.
5757398	5763243	Who could imagine that they would have Final Fantasy XIV coming out the same year as XIII, hypothetically?
5763563	5764884	I don't think they're actually going to make it.
5765084	5767046	I bet you anything XIV gets pushed back to 2011.
5767746	5774472	But just the fact that they kind of had the balls to do it, announce the next Final Fantasy game before one's even done, is kind of interesting.
5775833	5777174	So, we'll see.
5779083	5781325	Other big things announced at Sony's press conference.
5781365	5782746	How about Mod Nation Racers?
5783106	5784027	That was sweet looking.
5784047	5785288	That was a neat looking game.
5785328	5787029	Loki, tell us a little bit about this game.
5787430	5792854	Mod Nation Racers is going to be the next of that play, create, share type of game.
5793414	5797177	Basically like LittleBigPlanet, but with a Mario Kart racing game.
5797618	5803122	So you've got these characters that you create that kind of look like those money characters...
5803562	5804062	Thanks for watching!
5822774	5824956	So people are going to be able to make their own levels.
5825637	5828299	Obviously the Mario Kart rip-off levels are going to be in here as well.
5829400	5834244	But basically create whatever they want as far as races have goes and then share it with their friends.
5835846	5837567	It's going to be cool.
5838608	5843092	I can't wait to see how levels get moderated in this game for being Mario Kart courses.
5843953	5844614	It'll be interesting.
5846499	5847800	Space, The Final Frontier,
5868689	5871531	These are the Voyagers of the Starship OLR Prize.
5871972	5877416	And D'Artesuya continues, It's ongoing mission to seek out new life and new civilizations and blow shit up.
5879157	5882120	Ranma finishes, To boldly go where no geek has gone before.
5883000	5883501	Very nice.
5884361	5885062	Very nicely done.
5885102	5887043	I like the blow shit up part best.
5888244	5888585	Let's see.
5889125	5890886	Uncharted 2 Among Thieves.
5891547	5893949	I know there's a lot of folks very excited about this game.
5895170	5896791	I'm not one of them, but it looked neat.
5897592	5897812	What?
5899476	5899757	I don't know.
5899797	5900197	You know what?
5900317	5905742	I'm sitting here and I'm holding in my hand a multiplayer beta code for Uncharted 2.
5906863	5911006	And, you know, I don't really want to use it.
5911186	5912747	I don't think Loki wants to use it either.
5912828	5914709	DarkSakura probably not going to really play it.
5915109	5919293	So I'm thinking we should give this Uncharted 2 Among Thieves code to a listener.
5919313	5919753	What do you think?
5919933	5920434	Let's do it.
5920754	5927458	All right, here's the thing though, is that this listener has to be willing to write something for the website on this.
5927638	5932401	So if we give away this beta code, we want them to write something for the website with their impressions.
5932962	5933702	So that's the deal.
5933782	5935723	We give you the code, you give us an article.
5936144	5937785	So how do we give it away?
5937865	5938665	Do we give it away to live?
5938745	5940786	We should let the podcasters have a chance at it too, right?
5940826	5942888	Or maybe open it up on Twitter or something?
5942908	5944689	I think it should be a match game prize.
5944949	5946492	Maybe a match game prize later on?
5946793	5948536	No, I think some of you are a little bit more fair.
5948556	5950580	Yeah, a match game is only two people.
5951061	5951642	So let's see.
5952042	5954287	Maybe... Let's see.
5954387	5955329	Send us an email.
5957108	5958189	No, I got it.
5959010	5962834	Send us a tweet because you're restricted to 140 characters.
5963354	5967118	Send us a tweet as to why you should get this code.
5967959	5971182	And then we'll pick the ones we like and pick one at random.
5971243	5973885	We don't want to pick our favorite because that's a little too objective.
5974206	5976468	We'll take all the ones we like and pull one out at random.
5976748	5979471	So if you send us a tweet about... It better be awesome.
5979611	5980691	and not direct message.
5980791	5981671	Do not do a direct message.
5981691	5984712	You got to do at OLR and then whatever the message is.
5985052	5987973	So maybe by next show we'll figure out.
5988553	5989233	Is that too late?
5989793	5991913	Valid June 3rd through June 28th.
5992433	5994454	We probably need to give this away sooner rather than later.
5994854	5995494	Yeah.
5995594	5997354	How about tomorrow?
5998015	5998435	Yeah.
5998455	6000235	We post the reply on Twitter tomorrow.
6000255	6003836	The podcast won't be up tomorrow but maybe I'll post something on the Twitter about the contest tomorrow.
6003856	6004176	By Friday.
6005296	6005576	Thursday.
6006900	6008100	Maybe let's say midweek, Wednesday.
6008280	6009901	Because Wednesday is when the show should go up.
6009961	6017903	So we're going to say by Wednesday, if you send us a tweet about why you should get this Uncharted 2 beta code, we're going to take our favorites and randomly pick one and give it to you.
6017943	6019803	And then you're going to write something for our website.
6020864	6021304	There you go.
6022544	6023625	A 140-character essay.
6023685	6024225	I like that.
6024305	6028126	So to our favorite tweet at why you should have the Uncharted 2 code.
6028146	6030306	And we'll post a reminder on Twitter a little later on.
6030866	6031267	Exciting.
6031887	6032147	All right.
6033746	6034227	Grand Turismo PSP
6053482	6080659	for a PSP game it actually looked pretty good running at 60 frames per second looks very smooth about fucking time that it came out though seeing as it was supposed to be a launch title so they sure take their times on those Gran Turismo games Metal Gear Solid on the PSP as I predicted a game based off the Metal Gear Solid 3 universe there where you're playing as Big Boss what's kind of interesting though is they're going to have like
6081303	6091688	Online co-op or like ad hoc co-op or something like that where you can actually play as each person is like a big boss character which kind of is funny look like clones.
6094149	6095170	How about Assassin's Creed 2?
6097171	6100732	You know it's a neat trailer but I just don't really care about that game unfortunately.
6100852	6102273	I played the first one didn't like it.
6102413	6104914	Kind of file it in the hole don't have time to play everything?
6105074	6110497	Yeah it's sort of yeah it's a neat game they are doing a little bit more with it I think as far as
6111124	6115269	The Depth of the Game, but, I mean, if you like the first one, you're obviously gonna like this.
6116591	6122153	Uh, obviously we've been talking a lot about the PSP, but how can we not mention something about the PSP Go?
6122173	6124353	$249 for the PSP Go.
6124773	6127094	Are people gonna pay it, or did they shoot themselves in the foot?
6127114	6135656	That's a tough sell for a system that doesn't have a UMD drive on it, and I don't give a crap if it has 16 megs, or 16 gigabytes of storage.
6135937	6140918	You know what, I can buy a 16 gigabyte card for cheaper than the difference, so, um...
6143308	6149812	and there's a lot of stuff that we don't know that's like kind of as far as specs goes.
6150653	6151773	Is the processor better?
6153114	6153694	We don't know.
6153995	6154975	Is it the same?
6155115	6156796	I mean, has it got more RAM in it?
6157497	6159558	What exactly separates this?
6159658	6166862	Obviously now it can't really utilize some of the peripherals I think because of where they've placed different things on it.
6169624	6171845	It's a neat idea I guess but
6173995	6174900	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6177648	6179629	They're not really doing anything with this.
6179829	6185992	Well, here's what's interesting is that also one of the big things I said, am I going to be able to play my old UMDs on it?
6186092	6187933	And the answer is possibly.
6188133	6194897	We haven't heard the final answer yet, but apparently Sony isn't developing right now a Goodwill program is what they're calling it.
6195417	6202481	And basically they're saying it might be similar to portable copy, which is how you transfer your Blu-ray movies from the PS3 down to the PSP.
6203821	6206563	Users would not be ripping their UMDs,
6206983	6209987	But there'll be some type of digital distribution method on how it's done.
6210007	6215675	So it's going to be a code in a manual that you're going to basically be able to download it to your system or something like that.
6216096	6216517	Awesome!
6216597	6222325	So what's going to happen is someone's going to basically buy the game, dump the code in, return the game.
6222465	6222886	The end.
6223627	6248557	or you're going to have it where it's your well that might work for new games but what about the games that you have right now see that's the problem is how they're going to be able to do that and if it's a kiosk solution where you basically take it to a kiosk and it dumps it to your system that's a whole nother problem right there it just there's no real way I see this working you know other than you know having it be a code in the manual and even then
6249338	6250119	Sony's Motion Controller
6270612	6271812	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6294821	6297062	Really, it is kind of that patent we saw earlier.
6297102	6306568	Remember how you talked about how there was this EyeToy patent and that it was going to be red dots and blue dots that the EyeToy could see that would differentiate it and we thought it was something that would go on the regular controller?
6306608	6310131	Well, it's like this new little motion thing that has the things on it.
6310291	6310791	It looked dumb.
6311591	6313673	I mean, I'm sorry, but the controller looks retarded.
6314093	6323819	And, you know, the only cool thing that they did with it was the augment of reality stuff where, like, you see yourself and then when you're moving the thing around, it replaces it.
6324372	6325053	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
6354692	6360735	It's just, it... The thing I worry about with these motion controls is how well are they really going to work?
6361236	6362897	You know, we kind of went through this with the Wii.
6363297	6367179	When the Wii was announced, I think a lot of us, our jaws hit the floor and so forth.
6367359	6369620	And now when we kind of want, you know, sometimes it doesn't work.
6369860	6373442	Now they're telling us they've got to have Motion Plus because it doesn't work as well as they originally intended.
6373622	6378625	Here's what I want to, the main focus I would like to see with this is what are the limitations?
6379721	6382362	DarkSakura, DarkSakura S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
6401499	6402360	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6422444	6422665	and so on.
6438945	6439605	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6457864	6459385	The PlayStation Eye Sensors
6483158	6485843	And, you know, the camera's really kind of useless anyways right now.
6486124	6493257	I mean, I know because I own cameras for both, you know, the Vision camera and the PlayStation Eye and...
6494781	6496581	Honestly, haven't used either one of them, really.
6496881	6499362	I mean, other than trying out Totem Ball, which sucked.
6499962	6502283	But, it's just they're kind of useless.
6502683	6506644	And, I mean, Sony is doing a little bit more with the PlayStation Eye camera.
6506664	6509084	Like, they have the Eye Pet thing coming out.
6509164	6513165	They've got, you know, some cool implementations for, like, you know, photos and stuff like that.
6513185	6514225	And a little Big Planet.
6514825	6519186	You know, then the normal face mapping stuff for, like, the EA Sports games and stuff like that.
6519766	6522067	But, I just don't...
6523402	6523682	I don't know.
6523702	6526503	They're going to have to make this controller a lot better looking than it looks.
6526543	6527524	And I know it's a prototype.
6528024	6533846	And I want to read this comment from chat because here, Legend of Zaku in chat says, Jesus Christ, this goddamn prototype.
6533886	6541129	Remember that the PS3 controller is still in development, so everything you saw last week is a prototype tech demo, so the final versions will vary once it's released.
6541510	6544111	Well, yeah, but at the same time, this is...
6545111	6548975	Sony is in front of the world showing it what is going to be playing in the next year.
6549295	6553640	So while there might be slight variations, I mean, this is what they are planning right now.
6553960	6558024	And unless something freaking major happens, this is going to be what it is next year.
6558345	6562929	See, this to me looks almost like a copy of a Wii Remote.
6563490	6568235	Basically, it's kind of what... They're all, how can we mimic what the Wii Remote does...
6569605	6576027	But, you know, make it a little bit better and, you know, not use the same technology so we don't get sued.
6576668	6583670	That's what this seems like, whereas the Microsoft one was like, how can we do something that's motion control, but different and better?
6584390	6588772	And some folks in chat are invoking the PlayStation 3 boomerang, like GSX-H has changed his nickname.
6588792	6591393	Like, remember when the PlayStation 3 controller was supposed to look like that boomerang?
6591413	6591493	Yeah.
6591513	6593014	Yes, and thank God they didn't do that.
6593034	6595075	Because of all the negative reaction, they didn't end up doing that.
6595155	6600298	So, you know, Sony has been known to go back to the drawing board when they get negative reception.
6600358	6602058	So could something like that happen here?
6602198	6613564	Yes, and I just, I think the whole setup is going to be really, it's going to suck because, you know, once again, going back to the Microsoft one, you're not trying to sound like a fanboy here, but all you need is a camera.
6614165	6614405	Done.
6614885	6618687	You got the camera, you can play four players, 16 players, whatever the game's going to support.
6619087	6620408	Because you are the controller.
6621670	6622191	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6643911	6646153	White Knight Chronicles White Knight Chronicles
6665871	6667614	It's a very pretty looking game.
6667894	6670999	I had it described as Final Fantasy XII meets Xenogears.
6672502	6674845	It was a very pretty looking game.
6675506	6676568	I'm definitely interested in it.
6676989	6677590	That sounds cool.
6678004	6678945	Yeah.
6679005	6680085	Loki, you actually played it.
6680125	6681406	I had to watch you play that one.
6681426	6682606	What did you think of White Knight Chronicles?
6682626	6683787	How did it control?
6684047	6684908	It controlled fine.
6685028	6691711	It was just basically target something and then you had macros and pick which macro you want to, you know, which attack you want to do.
6691731	6695093	And then you can also set up a macro for a combo of attacks and stuff like that.
6696834	6697154	I don't know.
6697314	6698495	It seemed easy, but...
6699909	6702252	It was neat.
6702332	6709222	SSJ100Matt, going back to the motion control in chat room, chat.orange.com says, I think the fact that he gave a release date is what's bothering me.
6709282	6710704	Spring 2010 is too soon for that to be out.
6710724	6712426	They never stick to the release dates, ever.
6712747	6714529	Home got delayed how long?
6715350	6717992	I need to go grab some more water, so talk more about Sony with us, our listeners, Loki
6735501	6737342	including the PSP of course.
6738043	6741425	Other things, Resident Evil Portable was announced, which is pretty sweet.
6742025	6745687	We talked a little bit about Metal Gear Solid, Peace Walker, the PSP version there.
6746648	6747448	That was pretty cool.
6748929	6757854	Coming to both the 360 and PS3, and I think we may get into this a little bit more, but they have the new Metal Gear Solid Rising, or the Raiden one.
6758534	6763037	Yeah, that's actually, I wanted to find out if they did anything on that, because I actually like Raiden.
6763928	6764950	Yeah, that looked kind of cool.
6765190	6771919	And then, um... You know, they announced more stuff coming to, uh... Home.
6772760	6775164	But I kind of zoned out when that happened.
6775604	6777667	Uh, the biggest announcement, I think, well...
6778660	6806570	they didn't really show anything so it can't be that big of an announcement for me but Rockstar announced a new game franchise that's going to be exclusive to the PS3 called Agent that was going to be about secret agents and stuff like that the problem I have with this though is they also announced that franchise Noir is going to be a Playstation exclusive at one time and we still haven't even seen that yet so let's finish one franchise first before we start announcing another one that's my thing though
6807822	6835757	and then I did actually get to play the Motorstorm Arctic I forget the subtitle on it but the new Arctic themed Motorstorm game on the PSP that was pretty fun like a normal Motorstorm game actually looked pretty good on the PSP I watched other than White Knight Chronicles I watched some of the God of War stuff looks just like normal God of War games
6836809	6844636	They didn't really have... I was hoping to play that... What other PSP games do they have?
6846077	6851262	They have the add-on for Wipeout, HD, Licked OK.
6851282	6853323	Yeah.
6855615	6860956	But I kind of got a brief overview of everything that they had at Sony's booth, and they've got some pretty good stuff coming.
6861316	6863236	I didn't really see anything, though, on Gran Turismo 5.
6863796	6866217	I mean, they did announce Gran Turismo 5 is coming.
6866577	6868257	It's going to have 400 cars.
6868877	6883720	You know, great that it has 400 cars, but you know, the same time, Forza 3, they announced the launch date for it, and it's this fall, so you
6884468	6887269	Better hurry, because that looks pretty good too.
6887349	6891911	And honestly, 400 cars sounds good, but do we really need 400 cars?
6892411	6893351	I wouldn't know which one to pick.
6893651	6894392	I wouldn't know either.
6895372	6899954	All right, we need to do some of our regular segments here before we get to Microsoft's press conference.
6900814	6903055	It wouldn't be a week if we didn't say something angsty.
6903855	6905316	So let's do our FUs of the week.
6905416	6906396	Folks, how's that sound?
6906536	6907056	Let's shout.
6907096	6911299	Even though we haven't had anything angsty to bring this on, but I don't know.
6911759	6912219	You know what?
6912340	6916522	I could say something angsty to invoke this would be how much stuff we didn't get to see at E3.
6916862	6919884	There were way too many booths with way too much stuff behind closed doors.
6919944	6920665	What are you so afraid of?
6923006	6924507	So anyway, bring on the angst.
6939813	6941655	Um, F you to not being able to go to E3.
6943117	6945779	So, that's blanket.
6945879	6946920	And for being somewhat sick.
6947001	6947181	Okay.
6950312	6956734	F you to the Australian family that was eating next to us on Friday night.
6958155	6960335	I forget the restaurant, but they were famous for ribs.
6961115	6970738	Anyways, apparently they like to yell a lot and talk about how their aunt and uncle have sex right in front of their kids.
6971298	6977360	So F you to them because they were loud and obnoxious and we were making fun of them all weekend long.
6979002	6983605	So, yeah, they suck.
6984586	6985867	I don't really have a lot of FUs.
6986007	6988729	You know, I had the week off of work, and that's always something to be excited about.
6988769	6991531	So, FU to the fact that I have to go back to the old work tomorrow.
6991591	6992351	Oh, I got one more.
6993032	7001797	FU to my work for not actually finalizing my payment for my hotel that I stayed at in downtown LA.
7002138	7002918	Sticking me with an $800 bill.
7004279	7021467	because they didn't, either they screwed up or E3 Housing screwed up and my company, which was supposed to have, you know, faxed an authorization for their credit card, that didn't happen and so I had to pay like $600 more than I was expecting.
7022208	7023188	Oh, screw them.
7023408	7024649	You should really get reimbursed, right?
7025129	7026750	I better fucking get reimbursed.
7026770	7027190	There you go.
7028211	7028851	Take it to man.
7030412	7031012	All right.
7031630	7036255	One of our other segments we always have to do here every week on the show is the part where you get to interact with us.
7036335	7039638	And that's where you send us emails at Mailbag at OrangeLoungeReader.com.
7040039	7047466	And every week, the lovely Dark Sakura jumps into the mailbag headfirst and lands with a few emails on her forehead.
7047546	7051510	So she's going to pick out some of her favorites and read them for you right now.
7051811	7053292	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeReader.com.
7056175	7057475	The first one comes from Taz.
7057695	7058876	Well, Loki, you called it.
7059456	7065357	Seeing how the LEGO games have been in the past year, this one probably is going to turn out to be better than the rest of the Harry Potter games out there.
7066057	7075380	This is supposedly from years 1 through 4, and I guess we will see years 5 through 7 and then some perhaps when movie 8 comes out in 2011.
7075980	7080821	I'm wondering if the game will follow the same LEGO Star Wars formula, or would it go all new on us?
7081721	7090571	Anyways, I know have game for my soon-to-be wife, which I'm probably going to enjoy as well, the game you pervs.
7090591	7096518	I think he's talking, obviously he's talking about like a Harry Potter that got announced that was coming out, big surprise there.
7097399	7097459	Um...
7098424	7100685	The only good thing about that is that means that toys are coming back.
7100845	7101865	My wife was asking about that.
7101885	7103906	We actually went to the Lego store that was on Downtown Disney.
7104086	7104446	Oh, nice.
7105266	7106446	But no Lego Harry Potter.
7107067	7107927	No weird stuff.
7108747	7111468	They hopefully will re-release toys when that comes out.
7111668	7113789	I would not bet they're going to do anything new.
7113849	7115669	I think they have to stay pretty true to the books.
7115729	7117970	I think that might be some type of agreement.
7117990	7122952	I think he was saying as far as new as gameplay-wise compared to the other Lego Indiana Jones stuff.
7123172	7124072	I wouldn't expect anything.
7124812	7127533	Maybe the magic element, but that's probably as far as you're going to get.
7129304	7129724	So that's it.
7130545	7133306	The next one is from Cheeseburger.
7134687	7140291	Hey guys, you've been talking about your iTunes ranking and how people leaving negative reviews pushes you back a few pages.
7140811	7145073	Well, I've been thinking that when people subscribe to a podcast, that podcast rank will go up.
7145434	7149676	So is everyone unsubscribed and then resubscribed to OLR in one week, your rank would skyrocket?
7150196	7151957	Am I right or is this just a load of crap?
7152538	7157661	I guess we could just test it out this week, like set a date for the and then resubscription to OLR.
7159128	7163231	Oh, and he wanted you to verify your email address.
7163331	7169155	There's two ways that iTunes ranks shows, and the one where it has like five pages of featured shows, quote-unquote.
7169175	7170216	We're not even on it anymore.
7170316	7173118	Five pages of video game shows, we're not even there anymore.
7173558	7174759	So I don't know.
7175179	7177320	Just like I said, word of mouth is all we got, guys.
7177521	7179902	So I've kind of given up on the whole iTunes thing.
7181303	7182584	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7205180	7207222	There's an email that I don't think I can read.
7232489	7233370	Okay, skip it, do the next one.
7233390	7234410	It doesn't have punctuation.
7234630	7235391	Let's do the next one then.
7236091	7236551	Sorry.
7236771	7237572	You don't have to read them all.
7238032	7241234	I know, but I usually like to read them as much as I can.
7241954	7247938	But someone who really likes Pepsi Throwback, which I've had, me who does not like soda.
7248098	7248918	I still haven't had it.
7249439	7249879	It's good.
7250219	7250499	Is it?
7250799	7256783	It tastes like old, except it still has that, oh my god, I just sucked a spoonful of sugar aftertaste, which is like honey.
7257423	7257743	But anyway.
7257943	7258564	Where can I get it?
7259620	7260101	Walmart?
7260481	7260902	Everywhere?
7261502	7262764	I haven't seen it, I swear.
7262784	7265908	The gas station down the street from my house?
7266568	7267169	I'll check that out.
7267590	7268931	Okay.
7269151	7270753	This is the last one and it's a bit long.
7272395	7275579	And it is from, I think, Spazinator?
7275599	7275839	Spazinator?
7277501	7279904	So I will just hop right on in and read it.
7281105	7282286	Hi everyone!
7283127	7289433	I thought that I'd write in in order to bring up a few interrelated topics for today's show, being today's, assuming there is a show today.
7289774	7291475	Yep, there is, you're listening to it, hopefully.
7293117	7300545	Before I get to the topics at hand, I'd like to apologize in advance if this email runs unusually long, as I am combining two weeks worth of topics into one email.
7302128	7307511	First off, in regards to what Sky mentioned on the previous week's show, coming back to Final Fantasy XI, I'd like to say congrats.
7308271	7309412	You had made a fine choice.
7309992	7320458	If I may, I'd at least like to think that I may have possibly played a small role in influencing you in returning to the game, considering that I'm always talking about LLR.
7320678	7322139	How's your return to Vanadiel so far?
7322659	7328002	If you happen to be on either Odin or Alexander and see a Taru-Taru named Derwunch...
7329946	7331769	Dariwa Hyunjiwa
7346904	7368300	on a Final Fantasy related note what are your impressions of the announcement trailer from E3 regarding the previous unannounced Final Fantasy I think we've been over this personally I have mixed feelings about it on one hand being a big old Final Fantasy experience fan that I am I'm rather excited about any upcoming Final Fantasy game and new story experience points that each game brings
7370103	7376167	On the other hand, I'm concerned that Final Fantasy XIV being an MMO will cannibalize Final Fantasy XI's user base.
7376627	7381610	Hell, for all I know, Final Fantasy XI may, and I stress the word may, shut down as a result.
7382491	7388155	Even though I do plan to play XIV, I still don't want to leave XI or see any aspect of it suffer as a result.
7388235	7390096	The game has a damn good storyline and community.
7391554	7393915	There will always be people out there wanting to play XI.
7393955	7397155	You just might see some of the server consolidations and those types of things.
7397875	7400656	Yeah, inevitably some of the user base is going to go over to XIV.
7400696	7401576	That's just what happens.
7401616	7404437	But then again, look at EverQuest and EverQuest 2.
7405337	7409718	When EverQuest 2 came out, not a lot of people wanted to leave EverQuest 1.
7410218	7412279	And EverQuest 2 kind of suffered because of that.
7412739	7413339	However...
7414139	7416300	I think there's a lot different going on here.
7416340	7417940	I mean, for one, it's Final Fantasy.
7418000	7429663	For another, you have a lot of people, and I can't stress this enough, you have a lot of people who used to play XI and left because things weren't fixed, but I think they're going to want to give XIV a try.
7430123	7432563	So, is it possible for both games to coexist?
7432724	7438725	Yeah, but I think XI will probably shrink down significantly in size, but I think there'll always be people playing XI somewhere.
7440356	7441457	Final Fantasy XIV Final Fantasy XIV
7461751	7464673	As a broader question, what's everyone's impressions of this year's E3?
7466395	7469297	What do you feel are the high points as well as the low points?
7469417	7475422	Additionally, do you feel that there was a clear-cut winner between Microsoft, Nintendo, or Sony's conferences?
7475562	7480907	As a result of E3, would you say there's anything coming out between now and early next year that you're particularly psyched about?
7482136	7484818	Well, I think this show is going to kind of hit on all those points.
7484878	7486419	It's kind of what we built the show around tonight.
7486459	7492584	But I will say I will address the conference question between is there a clear winner between Microsoft, Sony, and Nintendo.
7492624	7496247	And I'm going to say no, there is no clear winner between the three.
7496327	7497508	I think the Twitter conference wins.
7499749	7500710	I guess, I guess.
7500830	7505514	But there is no winner in my opinion because not enough is out there right now.
7507102	7509243	I think Microsoft had a really good showing.
7509684	7523973	The only thing I think holding me back from Sony as far as grading them as high as Microsoft is a lot of their stuff that they announced, and granted Microsoft is capable of this as well, a lot of it is not coming out anytime soon.
7524474	7536502	Microsoft, they had Crackdown 2 and stuff that they announced, which we'll be getting into more of that stuff, 2010 stuff, but a lot of it they did announce with dates and time frames like this is coming out.
7537442	7537982	October.
7538602	7542944	This is coming out then instead of Final Fantasy XIV.
7543004	7545004	That's not coming out until next year.
7545044	7547165	This is part of our 10-year strategy.
7547205	7547605	Exactly.
7547805	7549366	Or Final Fantasy XIII.
7549406	7550826	That's not coming out until next year.
7551646	7553107	Or God of War 3.
7553187	7554707	That's not coming out until next year.
7556028	7560009	Really, the only games that they showed that were coming out this year were Uncharted 2.
7563061	7564382	And that's about it.
7564502	7570526	So a lot of the stuff that they're talking about, maybe White Knight Chronicles, I'm not sure about that, but a lot of it is all next year.
7570847	7572328	It's that 10-year plan.
7572648	7581214	And that's great that you're announcing stuff that's coming out, but Microsoft is announcing stuff that's coming out this year and stuff that's coming out next year.
7581534	7582115	And you know what?
7582195	7585617	When it comes to next year, they will have more stuff to announce that's coming out.
7586538	7587258	That's the thing.
7587318	7589040	That's what separates those two companies.
7589500	7590481	Sony likes to...
7591633	7615561	promise a lot but it takes a long time for them to come through with what they promise and you know Microsoft does the same thing to a lesser extent I think but I've just gotten tired of listening to what Sony has to say and promise and know really what's going to happen like you know Final Fantasy 14 and granted that's not really up to Sony but probably not coming out in 2010.
7619019	7620019	All right, we'll see.
7620100	7620920	Was that it for emails?
7621020	7621420	Any others?
7621860	7622921	Oh, there was more to that one.
7623081	7624361	Oh, okay.
7625462	7630604	For those of you that care, there's been some interesting stuff happening in the PSN store within the last two weeks.
7631184	7635866	Sony's been continuing to put more PS1 classics on there, most of which are pretty damn good.
7636326	7641248	Two noticeable ones are Resident Evil Director's Cut, complete with Jill's sandwiches, and wait for it at Final Fantasy VII.
7643900	7671222	I sure did and I have yet to play it because then I literally as Final Fantasy 7 was downloading I remembered that Final Fantasy 4 After Years had come out on Wii and I was like no I want to play that so I haven't gotten back to playing 7 yet keep in mind I was gone most of the week and that's good that they have stuff to download now some of their older Playstation 1 classics because they sure as hell aren't filling up their store full of new Playstation Network games
7673618	7673858	True.
7674299	7675500	I guess they need something to keep them afloat.
7675760	7677642	There's more to this email.
7677802	7679384	Okay.
7681025	7681426	Where was I?
7681526	7681706	Okay.
7682507	7691916	Once Jack Trenton mentioned that Final Fantasy VII was coming to the US PSN store, nearly... This is nearly, I guess, supposed to say every Final Fantasy fan collectively just their pants.
7693077	7693217	No.
7695058	7699919	They also added a bunch of other stuff on the game side too numerous to mention.
7700619	7709181	Additionally, they have expanded their offerings on the video side of the store to include somewhere in the ballpark of 10-15 more supported TV networks including Showtime and G4.
7709861	7716783	Additionally, they're giving away for free two TV show pilots, Dexter from Showtime as well as Voltron.
7717563	7721084	On a side note, although it's been on the video store
7722284	7722965	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
7740302	7742564	Well, thanks for taking the time to read my email.
7742604	7743164	It's appreciated.
7743244	7746346	Again, sorry, especially to DarkSakura, who usually ends up reading the emails.
7746526	7748407	Thank you for such a long email.
7748868	7753831	I do like how they are adding more anime studios to that, because I think that's something that diversifies them a little bit.
7753871	7762316	I'm not sure what their anime coverage is for the 360, but I know... I don't think there's that much on there.
7762636	7765198	But that's kind of cool to diversify themselves a little bit with that.
7768320	7768680	I don't know.
7768740	7769101	It's just...
7771394	7771955	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
7787150	7788691	Are we going to get episodes of Cops and Cheaters?
7788751	7790872	I mean, is that going to be part of the lineup?
7791692	7791992	Awesome.
7792012	7797355	I want the Excuse My Beauty transsexual episode, which I believe was Albuquerque Police.
7797775	7799035	I would pay for that episode.
7799075	7799996	I would so I could watch that.
7800816	7802997	Excuse My Beauty, officer.
7803537	7805158	I'll go back to Arizona, I swear.
7806219	7808340	If you haven't seen it, YouTube, Excuse My Beauty.
7808720	7809240	It's amazing.
7810848	7811889	Starcade, or something like that.
7812830	7813330	But I doubt it.
7823773	7826916	Xlink in chat wants to point out G4 is free on iTunes.
7827396	7829818	Brad from PopCulture says Cops is on Hulu.
7829858	7830618	Oh, I didn't realize that.
7831239	7836642	Sephiroth1215 says, speaking about the Sony press conference, I mean, we have to think of the years as fiscal.
7836782	7842847	A lot of companies end their fiscal years in March so they can release games up until that point and be keeping the truth of coming out this year.
7844728	7845248	Yes and no.
7845328	7848170	I still think a lot of this stuff when they say 2010, they don't mean March.
7848371	7849591	They mean like October.
7849611	7852914	They should say this fiscal year instead of this year because that, I'm sorry, that's,
7854944	7880417	I think the only games that might come out before holiday 2010 are Final Fantasy XIII at least in Japan and that's why I don't think XIV is going to come out in 2010 because I think XIII is going to barely make the holidays but it's a different team working on it so I could see that happening that would be so weird if that happened and then God of War 3 I think will come out early no you don't think so?
7880598	7881438	March for sure
7882327	7882707	Oh, March.
7883808	7884068	Not.
7884288	7885288	They already announced it's March.
7885369	7885649	I see.
7885989	7887670	So, well, okay, then that's before the holidays.
7888050	7890331	Uncharted 2 will be the big holiday game for them.
7890991	7894773	Mag was another game that they were showing off that I don't know if it's going to be out this year.
7895473	7895974	It looked cool.
7896174	7897254	I watched people playing it.
7897374	7907059	I mean, if you're into Call of Duty and stuff, you're really going to enjoy that game because it's a massive battleground, basically, of everything that you've seen in Call of Duty and
7908359	7923302	all your multiplayer first person shooter games so that'd be kind of cool if that comes out this year I'm not sure if it is I would hope that they put out Gran Turismo 5 this year because I think they kind of have to you know with Forza 3 coming out I mean
7925456	7926617	I don't know.
7927858	7932082	And then as far as what they're going to fill in the rest of the year with, that's a good question.
7932723	7933644	Because I don't really know.
7934324	7938669	I mean, Heavy Rain is supposed to be coming out this year, I thought.
7939369	7941271	That wasn't even there at all.
7941852	7942192	Nothing.
7944514	7945415	No mention of it at all.
7946303	7946623	All right.
7947684	7949565	I believe that was all the emails we got.
7949765	7952807	So if you want to send us more, mailbag at orangelandredo.com.
7953428	7962494	Let's move on to Microsoft, and then we'll let Loki throw in anything else he wants to, because I know he's probably got some other games he wants to talk about, and then wrap up with just a couple phone calls.
7962534	7967437	Probably not going to take a lot of phone calls tonight, just because we've been chatting a long time tonight, but we'll do what we can.
7968198	7972260	Anyhow, I want to talk about Microsoft and some of the things they talked about at their press conference.
7972280	7974862	Let's just start with the big one, which is Project Natal.
7976483	8002322	which obviously you know I'm pretty sure you guys are all aware it's the motion controller that's camera only there is no controller with it I don't know if you've watched the trailer that goes with it but it's very interesting because the scene that struck me specifically was when the girl walks into the room and the Xbox 360 know who she is and she gets a phone call from her friend or whatever on the 360 and her friend says hey I picked out this cute new outfit for you you should try it on
8002622	8003722	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
8022833	8027435	Anyhow, all that aside, let's just talk about Project Natal.
8027495	8028736	I don't know, Loki, what were your thoughts?
8029697	8030437	I think it's really cool.
8030717	8034579	I thought, wow, this is really good, and it set them apart from Nintendo.
8034919	8040722	They can do a lot more with this if it actually lives up to all the stuff that they say it can do.
8040942	8050127	And, I mean, they have kind of demonstrated, you know, their live demonstration of how, like, playing that giant breakout game, which...
8051155	8051996	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
8067262	8078729	It looked easy to use, looked very intuitive, and I like some of the... I mean, it's very unnecessary as far as browsing your menus and stuff by swishing your hand around.
8079109	8083052	I mean, that's cool and all, but I'll just use the controller because it's a lot faster.
8083252	8084893	But, you have the option.
8085153	8086794	I mean, you don't have to do it that way.
8087815	8091877	But then again, if I'm trying to shoo away my cat, I don't want it moving through menus.
8092438	8092578	So...
8094962	8096227	We'll see how that ends up.
8096488	8097351	It could be really cool.
8099266	8099626	I don't know.
8099726	8102708	If they could come up with maybe like a one-handed controller or something like that.
8102748	8107610	Something really small, almost like the Nunchuck or something, so you can, you know, say like you're playing... The Buzz controller.
8107951	8109151	I'm not Buzz, sorry.
8109171	8110032	The Scenic controller.
8110272	8111052	Yeah, something like that.
8111092	8117676	You know, very small, so you can have some of that, you know, controller stuff and then doing your motion stuff with your other hands or something.
8118136	8121898	Like, some of the things I think were unnecessary, like they showed in the video, like the driving.
8122158	8124579	I don't want to have to hold my hands out like a steering wheel.
8125480	8126200	That's not for me.
8126600	8127601	I mean, I'd rather...
8128846	8130687	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
8155868	8156969	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
8172768	8173328	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
8202877	8203804	So, I don't know.
8203824	8204206	We'll see.
8205359	8207140	That sounds like a prescription drugs name, by the way.
8207340	8211121	I am extremely, extremely skeptical about this.
8211681	8215022	I don't think it's going to work as nice as they're showing it in these trailers and things.
8215062	8219644	And this whole concept of people don't want to have buttons and stuff, that's just not true.
8220104	8221965	I'm sorry, but I don't think that's true.
8222365	8226286	And the whole thing about, well, people get intimidated by all these buttons and things.
8226726	8227306	I don't buy it.
8227566	8228087	You know what?
8228167	8230588	There's one device everybody knows how to use.
8231148	8232848	Everybody fights over it all the time.
8233108	8234689	When somebody loses it, people...
8235069	8235970	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
8258982	8259602	DarkSakura.com
8277668	8277988	Hub.
8278088	8278789	I get it, I get it.
8278829	8286615	They're gonna have that, but I just, you know, the fanboys are going crazy with this 360 thing, and I'm sorry, you know, call me whatever name you want.
8286975	8293140	I'm extremely skeptical about this whole thing, and I have a right to be, because the Xbox Vision camera sucks.
8293780	8294480	It sucks.
8295100	8296341	What can you do with that camera?
8296361	8296841	Exactly.
8297241	8299982	Especially compared to what they showed us years ago.
8300182	8305424	When they first showed us the camera, we were promised all these games that were going to integrate the camera.
8305744	8306464	And what do you have?
8306524	8308925	You have Uno and some of the other Xbox Live Arcade games.
8309265	8312827	And a couple third-party developers threw us a few bones there with the EA.
8313167	8315207	You have the Burnout license plate.
8315267	8316068	Big fucking deal.
8316468	8319429	And then you have the You're in the Movies.
8320635	8321777	and then Totem Ball.
8322418	8327969	And remember when Totem Ball kind of looked fun from the previews that we were shown at that E3 when the vision camera was announced?
8328269	8330153	Now, Totem Ball might have actually been kind of cool.
8330573	8331956	It was shit.
8333007	8362927	and the way you controlled that whole thing it doesn't the same thing with the eye toy it is never picking up your body correctly it doesn't see your motion right if you don't have exactly the right lighting in your house the thing sucks and if you don't believe me check out some of those eye toy games on the Playstation 2 they're terrible so I think seeing this whole you know motion and movement is how we're going to control our games I am extremely skeptical about it I have a right to be I've seen this before and it sucks why should I feel any different?
8362987	8363828	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
8381809	8386896	Microsoft bought the company and now they're working exclusively with them to put out this technology.
8387196	8393765	And I do understand, you know, trust me, I bought cameras for all those systems and they all piss me off.
8393885	8397550	And yes, I'm very skeptical on buying another camera that...
8398908	8399649	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
8426365	8430088	Johnny Chung Lee, the guy who did head tracking with the Wii, is working on Natal.
8430108	8431729	It has to work because he is pure genius.
8450001	8458165	TigerClaw says, in order for it to pick up the entire room, it's got to be a widescreen view of the area so that everyone can be involved, insinuating that it's probably a widescreen camera.
8458385	8461426	Well, it's a camera, but it's also got other sensors on it, too.
8461527	8464288	So it's not just, you know, it's going to be infrared.
8464388	8471211	I think it's infrared, because it looks like there's two infrared sensors on it or something, unless those are just indicator lights for different stuff.
8471531	8474813	But yeah, the camera's really wide, and it...
8475373	8475915	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
8483505	8484785	I want to keep reading comments from chat.
8484825	8485806	Great stuff from chat tonight.
8486066	8496968	Sephiroth1215 says, I feel more satisfied with the Sony Wiimote because while it might just be practically the same, it will be nice to play games with it that are meant for the core gamer, which Nintendo doesn't do.
8497708	8503690	Ziba says, and in all the videos I've seen with it, their living rooms have so much room in front of the TV.
8504130	8507290	I don't know any house that has that much room in front of the TV like that.
8508171	8509151	It's also a set.
8509831	8511412	True, but I mean, that makes a good point.
8512473	8514854	Will this work in close quarters as well as far away?
8514914	8517656	I can tell you for certain, my living room is really small.
8517936	8519857	Well, how do you play Wii Sports and Wii Bowling?
8519897	8521478	Because I know that takes up some space.
8522499	8529143	You know, I know when we're playing Wii Bowling and Wii Sports and stuff like that, we push out the coffee table, move it out of the way.
8529383	8532545	And yeah, I know it's just one of the requirements.
8532565	8534106	You've got to have space.
8534246	8535787	And guys, don't get me wrong.
8535847	8538229	When I say I'm skeptical, that doesn't mean I hate it.
8538789	8539870	I think it's a great idea.
8539990	8546213	If they pull off everything they're promising, I will bow down and suck Xbox's cock.
8547513	8551195	It truly is one of the greatest things I've ever seen in that case.
8551495	8554656	But excuse me if I'm a little bit skeptical.
8555397	8558018	I think I have a right based on some of the crap we've seen before.
8558238	8558518	Right?
8559299	8560099	I fully agree.
8562420	8565261	I'm just cautiously optimistic.
8565642	8566442	Okay, that's fair.
8566962	8568163	Cautiously optimistic.
8569207	8573572	Optimistic to the point of if this ends up being crap, then yes, I'm not going to buy it.
8573852	8577156	But I need to see it actually being utilized.
8577176	8584103	And I trust that Microsoft would probably understand that, you know what, this isn't going to be just for the casual gamer.
8584243	8588768	Let's implement this and maybe some other stuff and see what we can do with it.
8590359	8593361	Alright, moving on to some other topics because we have a lot of ground to cover.
8593401	8597724	I'm sure some of the callers are going to want to revisit this because probably Natal is the thing that's got the biggest buzz out of E3.
8597764	8599045	I do want to mention this.
8599265	8604088	Speaking of buzz, my Twitter has filled up with blah blah blah about 1 versus 100.
8604128	8613234	And I feel completely out of the loop because I have yet to play it because I've not been home when all these beta tests have been going on or what have you.
8613414	8614855	I don't know why.
8615575	8617096	It's a freaking game show.
8618297	8618697	You know what?
8618737	8621219	If so many people are saying good things about it, there must be something good about it.
8621259	8622279	People are having fun with it.
8622519	8623400	That's what games are supposed to be.
8623420	8624181	They're welcome to it.
8624861	8625461	So, I don't know.
8625501	8627202	Loki, you just got home today.
8627222	8628083	Of course you haven't tried it.
8628103	8628703	Of course not.
8629384	8630444	I definitely want to check it out.
8631945	8633586	It's so freaking popular on Twitter.
8633606	8636328	I'm surprised it's not in the trending topics so many people talk about it.
8636688	8639590	Okay, some of the other things that were mentioned at Microsoft's press conference.
8639630	8640171	Left 4 Dead 2.
8641874	8643616	That's got a lot of people pissed off.
8643856	8645598	It looked cool, I thought, to me.
8645878	8649522	When I first saw it, I thought there was this one game that was supposed to be coming out.
8649622	8654146	It was like Voodoo something or other that had Samuel L. Jackson doing the voice of the main character.
8654547	8656649	I thought that's what that was, and then they were all left for dead too.
8656669	8659432	I'm like, oh, I guess it could be that too.
8660052	8660493	But, um...
8661618	8663419	A lot of people are just shouting too soon.
8663579	8666760	In fact, there's a petition already with 13,000 people on it.
8667860	8670501	Petitions online don't really do anything, but whatever.
8671181	8676143	That are saying it's too soon, that they didn't support the first game enough, and that Valve's cashing in.
8676663	8679604	Honestly, if you ask me, I think that you've been spoiled by Valve.
8679644	8682305	And so now they're actually putting out another game.
8684185	8684765	So what?
8684965	8686466	Don't pick it up if you don't want to pick it up.
8687894	8688955	Wait for it to go on sale.
8689256	8690417	Yeah, wait for it to go on sale.
8690557	8693801	They always have these crazy ass sales six months, a year later.
8694041	8701849	No one's forcing you to buy it, but people are pissed off because they've been spoiled with all Team Fortress 2 updates on PC.
8702390	8705873	Not on 360, but on PC and all the other stuff.
8707195	8708296	Whatever, dude.
8708376	8709177	I mean, seriously.
8711169	8713812	Just, it's in a different setting, okay?
8714853	8715253	I don't know.
8716354	8722079	Different setting, you've got a little bit different game modes in there.
8723981	8726043	If that's enough for you to buy another game, then buy it.
8726163	8727685	If not, then don't.
8727965	8731288	Yeah, but Left 4 Dead has hugely rabid fans in it.
8731588	8732569	I'm sure there's tons of people.
8732910	8733971	This thing's going to sell like crazy.
8733991	8735152	Rabid indicates disease.
8736021	8737522	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
8758450	8763454	The fact that Left 4 Dead 2 is nearly identical to Left 4 Dead 1 and will decimate the community of both games.
8764275	8768738	The announced date is not nearly enough time to polish content or make significant gameplay changes.
8769159	8787174	Which, all these are really assumptions on the development process, and since none of these people actually work for Valve, then I don't really know where they're actually, you know, how they're able to make these comments actually, you know, with... I seem to recall Left 4 Dead got some pretty awesome support after it came out, like there was a free pack that came out afterwards with some new stuff, you know...
8788140	8790120	I don't know, I think you guys have it pretty good.
8813285	8815446	or not 4, 5 taking place in Africa and guess what?
8815486	8817066	It was bright and cheery but there's zombies.
8817346	8818787	Did anyone bitch about that?
8818967	8819207	No.
8820607	8827329	The fiddle based horde music is extremely disliked though differently orchestrated music is otherwise welcome.
8828089	8840272	Left 4 Dead 2's release will result in a drop of quality and frequency of Left 4 Dead 1 content even compared to before and the community has lost faith in Valve's former reputation for commitment to their games post-release.
8843172	8844473	is what I hear because you know what?
8844513	8849718	When I went to Microsoft's booth and EA's booth, guess where the lines were?
8849878	8850659	For Left 4 Dead 2.
8851119	8854763	So go suck it because enough people out there fucking love that game.
8855183	8856645	At least wait until the game comes out.
8856725	8857305	Exactly.
8857325	8858166	It's way too early to start.
8858166	8858586	DarkSakura.com
8884913	8897764	The Halo series has Halo Reach and Halo ODST Talk about milking a franchise Holy shit Oh, Halo's done Oh, no it's not We need to put out some more prequels
8899978	8901919	There won't be a Halo 4, but damn it.
8902539	8906061	ODST looks kind of okay.
8906101	8908742	Gameplay-wise, I don't know what they're really going to do different than Halo 3.
8909502	8921166	And just to make sure that you're a sucker and buy ODST, they're throwing in a bunch of freebies, and they're also going to throw in a beta to Halo Reach, which we don't even know what the hell it is yet, other than it's going to be another prequel.
8922607	8923067	Awesome.
8924547	8925828	Not interested in it one bit.
8926747	8929829	Oh, and they're going to have a collector's edition, as they have to do with every Halo game.
8930129	8933752	And they're going to include another Xbox 360 controller.
8933972	8936914	No, just an Xbox 360 controller that has special painting on it.
8937774	8939335	Wow, are you a... Do you have a functional D-pad?
8940656	8942777	No, but it's camo.
8943718	8947801	Brad from PodCulture in chat comments, ODST has Nathan Fillion.
8948841	8954405	So... Oh, well then that's perfect for all those fanboys out there who love Nathan Fillion.
8957009	8959170	Crackdown 2 Crackdown 2 Crackdown 2
8980820	8983683	and they're also going to have 16 player deathmatch in it which is awesome.
8984603	8985864	How about Shadow Complex?
8985924	8993311	This is the one that Cliffy B came out and you all think it's going to be Gears of War 3 but nope, it's a game called Shadow Complex which is an Xbox Live Arcade game.
8993691	8995292	Kind of looks like Bionic Commando Rearmed.
8996593	9005341	I think it was supposed to be more like Castlevania and Metroid is kind of what they were comparing it to and it looked neat.
9007583	9008143	I don't know...
9010262	9012403	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
9039738	9040879	DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com
9059079	9062181	Not really my cup of tea, but it's a neat feature.
9062661	9067563	And then also kind of including the same stuff that they had in Forza 2 with all the designing cars.
9067923	9072406	They kind of spent a little bit much, a lot of time on the whole designing cars thing.
9072426	9075687	Like, oh, it's a way for me to express myself and stuff like that.
9076107	9081810	That was a little bit of, I don't know, ridiculous if you ask me.
9081890	9085232	Because, dude, just, I don't know.
9086502	9088123	Draw something on paper or something.
9088223	9088603	I don't know.
9088683	9091504	Seriously, there's other ways to express yourself, not this game.
9091684	9095325	This game didn't just come out and go, oh my god, now I can actually express myself for the first time.
9096186	9098106	I express myself through playing The Sims.
9099187	9105689	Well, maybe you can upload some of these high-def videos and pictures to the brand new Facebook integration on Xbox Live.
9105889	9108350	But wait, wait, it doesn't stop there.
9108490	9110431	Twitter on Xbox Live as well.
9111004	9112725	The Facebook thing actually looked kind of cool.
9112745	9118307	The only reason it looked cool is because you can actually... Upcoming games are going to support this in-game screenshot thing.
9118827	9119487	That's kind of neat.
9120228	9121128	That's kind of neat.
9122588	9123989	I don't know about Facebook and Twitter.
9124109	9126050	I mean, I don't use Twitter that much.
9126150	9128011	And Facebook, I really don't use that much.
9128111	9129611	So, it'll be neat.
9130111	9131452	And I'm glad that they're adding more things.
9133066	9147078	web browser, please just add a web browser don't need all these things, just add a web browser guess what, I can go to facebook.com or I can go to twitter.com and add tweets that way I have facebook on my iphone so I don't need anything else
9147868	9148889	at a web browser.
9149850	9154393	And, and, and, not just that, Last.fm was another integration they announced.
9154493	9155153	That's pretty cool.
9156074	9161218	So that you'll be able to, I guess, stream the Last.fm radio, I'm assuming, to the Xbox 360.
9161538	9162859	I kind of took that assumption.
9163299	9165020	Or it's going to track your plays from the 360.
9165781	9167282	I'm not sure exactly how that's working.
9169758	9178582	I don't really use Last.fm, so exactly what kind of stations are we talking like music hosted on servers and we can stream stations based on artists?
9178622	9179462	Well, here's the thing.
9179642	9185705	On Last.fm, it basically tracks everything you play using a scrabbler, everything that you play.
9186165	9189327	So what you can do once you've tracked some of your listening things...
9189727	9189907	Podcasts
9218091	9221133	Funny enough, if you listen to podcasts on iTunes, they get scrabbled.
9223255	9228098	There's an entry for Orange Lounge Radio on Last.fm because people listen to our show, and so it goes into there.
9228479	9234223	But I wouldn't think that this integration is going to mean that the podcasts are suddenly going to be listed.
9234243	9235624	I don't think it's going to do anything for us.
9236065	9238226	But yeah, podcasts are a small part of Last.fm.
9238286	9238747	Very small.
9238787	9238867	Neat.
9242273	9243154	I know, it could be interesting.
9244334	9246536	I'm not sure, you know, we need to kind of hear more about it.
9246916	9248277	But that was kind of a surprise.
9249058	9254521	Some of the other things that they talked about at the press conference, Final Fantasy XIII actually running on the Xbox 360, which looked fun.
9254762	9256683	Big deal, looked like the PlayStation 3 one.
9256883	9258004	I mean, not a big surprise there.
9258024	9259425	Which we all knew it kind of should.
9260706	9262547	Metal Gear Solid Rising.
9262867	9263748	Not 4, Rising.
9264088	9266229	Well, we knew that the Raiden Metal Gear Solid was coming out.
9266289	9266810	I mean, that's...
9268515	9269256	We already knew that.
9269376	9270296	It wasn't a big surprise.
9271137	9275699	But boy, when Kojima walked out on that stage, I bet there were a lot of people thinking, here it is.
9276220	9276780	Here it is.
9277020	9278961	Yeah, they were thinking, oh.
9279822	9281743	And I love the way they worded it.
9281803	9283924	Now the Metal Gear franchise has come to the 360.
9285805	9287546	And they made it sound like it was exclusive.
9288687	9289207	But it's not.
9290028	9290168	No.
9290708	9290828	No.
9290928	9292269	Metal Gear Solid Rising is not.
9292659	9297943	You know, and I think this just cements, and I better not hear it ever again.
9298304	9300806	Metal Gear Solid 4 is not coming to the 360.
9301626	9304348	If it was, you would have heard it this year at E3.
9304729	9305269	It is done.
9305329	9306170	They have moved on.
9306590	9310233	This is how they're getting Metal Gear Solid on the 360 is moving forward.
9310473	9315317	There is a new Metal Gear Solid PlayStation Network and live game that's coming out.
9315337	9316918	It's using the Metal Gear Solid 4 engine.
9317299	9317599	Oh, neat.
9317699	9318199	What game is that?
9318480	9320401	I don't remember what it's called, but I remember hearing about it.
9321222	9321302	Um...
9322898	9324301	Maybe that's that Metal Gear Solid arcade.
9325464	9326025	Probably what that is.
9326145	9329392	I was thinking an arcade game, but it's actually for Xbox Live Arcade.
9331792	9332452	So that's kind of neat.
9334314	9335435	There you go, Metal Gear Solid 4.
9335475	9335435	360.
9336315	9337596	A couple other games.
9337696	9338537	Modern Warfare 2.
9339157	9340838	I don't know if you are into this, Loki.
9341699	9342840	No, not my thing.
9343340	9349824	Yeah, again, this kind of falls in the category of, hey, it looks neat for the people that are into that sort of game, but I can't play everything.
9350505	9351205	Alan Wake.
9351305	9352626	Let's close with Alan Wake.
9352686	9353747	What did you think of this one?
9354848	9356629	It's nice to actually see the game being played.
9356649	9357490	A little...
9358010	9358330	Weird.
9358490	9358831	I don't know.
9358851	9360292	The whole light-dark thing is kind of neat.
9361272	9362093	Reminds me of that WiiWare game.
9362113	9365015	I wanted to know about that one because I wasn't sure on it.
9366176	9369859	Well, here's a little trailer I can actually play here, except there's a lot to this.
9369879	9376103	It's a very lengthy trailer.
9376263	9377885	Let me see if I can skip ahead a little.
9379466	9385110	Actually try to show some of the... Yeah, I don't like the previously on Alan Wake because it reminds me of...
9386283	9386823	A Little in the Dark
9417165	9419026	X-Link in chat says it looks like Silent Hill meets Supernatural.
9419046	9419907	That would be like Jamie's dream game.
9419927	9421628	Yeah, that would really be my dream game.
9421648	9424450	I think I would have to check this one out after all.
9442294	9443174	Loki, what did you want to add?
9443634	9446576	I was going to add there was one thing that didn't get announced.
9447156	9449217	Actually, a few things that they announced and touched on.
9450518	9454820	One, some new enhancements to Netflix.
9455400	9464245	Now you're going to be able to actually add stuff to your streaming queue straight from the 360, not having to go back to your PC, which is kind of cool.
9465546	9468147	You'll be able to also browse through different categories on there.
9468187	9469147	They're also doing...
9470268	9472089	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
9491303	9499947	The Xbox video marketplace is being relaunched at the Zune video this fall to kind of integrate it with their Zune HD stuff.
9500147	9502107	Which did not come up at the conference at all.
9504168	9507809	And then also this one was a really big surprise.
9507889	9509950	It didn't come up at the conference at all.
9511110	9514852	You're going to be able to download full Xbox 360 games starting in August.
9516173	9541950	on their service and you're going to be able to basically buy brand new games including like Mass Effect, Assassin's Creed, Civilization Revolution it's going to be you can use Microsoft points or actually use a credit card to buy these games and they're full retail games that do not require a disc at all and they will store it on your hard drive that just sounds a bit bizarre yeah kind of interesting the whole digital distribution thing huh
9543129	9547643	Just like full... The whole damn game.
9547984	9548626	That's pretty crazy.
9551277	9555839	Alright, so that pretty much wraps it up for everything I wanted to say about the press conferences.
9557060	9561962	DarkSakura, I know you had a few stories you wanted to talk about tonight that weren't really necessarily tied in completely to E3.
9562062	9564884	But some of it was touched on a bit.
9564924	9566044	Let me pull up.
9567545	9572128	And then I'm going to probably just turn it back to Loki, see if there's anything else he wants to mention about E3.
9573008	9576670	We need to cover release dates at some point too, don't we?
9577410	9580832	So we'll cover release dates as well and get into those.
9581505	9584487	I unfortunately accidentally closed my release date page.
9585228	9593193	We are going to go to the Skype line tonight, but since we anticipate there's going to be a lot of calls tonight, we're going to institute our two-minute rule tonight, which means no call is going to go longer than two minutes.
9593453	9595275	We're going to be asking everyone the same questions.
9595475	9597356	Who are you, and what did you think of E3?
9597396	9602880	So we'll give everyone their two minutes, but since we want to get through a lot of calls tonight, just so you know, that's going to be the rule tonight.
9604261	9608044	I know that might be sad, but at the same time, that means we get more people on the phone, and that's happy.
9608504	9609185	Alright, there we go.
9609285	9609705	Be happy.
9609745	9610286	Yeah, DarkSakura.
9610306	9629906	Alright, what we have is, for the 10th, this is UK releases, by the way, we have Draconica on PC, and then on the 12th we have EA Sports Grand Chellum Tennis, Indiana Jones and the Staff of Kings on a bunch of systems, Prototype on PC, PS3, Xbox 360, and that's it.
9634373	9639295	Going over to Japan, you might have heard me mention last week, there really is not a lot to look forward to in Japan this month.
9639355	9643476	It's a very slow release over in Japan, and that continues to be true this week.
9643516	9651059	There really isn't anything out on the Xbox 360 or the PlayStation 3, although a big game's getting a price drop next week.
9651599	9652859	I'll have to tell you about that next week.
9653179	9657441	But going to some of the other systems, again, going to Japan, on the PlayStation 2...
9658681	9659381	Again, nothing.
9659421	9661762	There is literally nothing coming out in Japan this week.
9661802	9663263	Let me see if the DS is any different.
9663643	9669665	Okay, on the DS you get Infinite Space is a new game from Sega coming out.
9670685	9671546	That comes out this week.
9671746	9673707	That is really the only big release on the DS.
9673727	9675367	That's a new Platinum Games game.
9676167	9676608	Is it really?
9676788	9678228	Yeah.
9678288	9680469	Trying to see if there's anything on the Wii to mention this week.
9681571	9698202	Chibi-Robo, the Wii version comes out in Japan this week as well as Metroid Prime 2 with Wii controls but of course as you know it's coming out here in the US pretty soon as a combined one and then quickly looking at the PSP for Japanese release dates I really don't think
9699244	9700744	There's anything this week either.
9700824	9701685	Oh no, I take that back.
9701745	9704346	Of course there is another Neon Genesis Evangelion game.
9705166	9708067	Kotsetsu no Girlfriend 2nd Portable Limited Edition.
9708127	9712728	Oh, they're doing... I've played that game too.
9713088	9714849	The Girlfriend of Steel.
9716189	9721191	Fate Unlimited Codes Portable is now coming to the PSP in Japan this week.
9721231	9723491	It's a PS2 game that's been ported.
9724071	9725552	A 3D fight for the Holy Grail.
9726598	9727838	That's it for Japanese releases.
9728319	9728919	In the U.S.
9728939	9733601	there wasn't a whole lot this coming week here, but today we had Legendary Starfy.
9734081	9739643	It's a 2D platforming franchise from Nintendo that's finally made its way over to the United States.
9740903	9746806	Also, next week we'll be getting Tiger Woods PGA Tour 2010 on all platforms.
9747106	9752368	A lot more games you're going to see coming out supporting Wii Motion Plus since that's also coming out on the 9th.
9754310	9764263	including EA's Grand Slam Tennis of course there's also the Tiger Woods PGA Tour Wii Bundle with Wii Motion Plus and then finally also coming out that
9765469	9767210	I think there was one other Wii Motion Plus game.
9767270	9767551	Oh yes!
9768051	9772455	Virtua Tennis 2009 on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and the Wii.
9773235	9775918	And then other games other than Wii Motion Plus stuff.
9776618	9780461	Prototype coming out on PS3 and Xbox 360 and I believe PC.
9781883	9786586	And also we've got some really crappy games.
9787347	9791991	Diva Girls, Divas on Ice on the DS.
9792711	9793612	And I think on the Wii.
9794333	9794453	Um...
9795700	9801627	Indiana Jones and the Staff of Kings on PlayStation 2, the Wii, the PSP, and I believe the DS.
9802648	9803829	Vertigo, which is a...
9805573	9834041	Marble Blast type of game that's going to be coming out on the Wii it's a budget title also this week Rock Band Unplugged coming out on PSP and also the bundle to go along with that and back to crappy games Pets Fashion Dogs and Cats yes a game where you can dress up both dogs and cats to look absolutely ridiculous and on the Wii we have Go Play Lumberjacks Lumberjack themed games and Go Play Circus Star I'm a lumberjack and I don't care
9834601	9863096	seriously and then let's see here oh and then how could I forget Guitar Hero On Tour Modern Hits the third DS game not supporting the DSi Pool Hall Pro another budget Wii billiards game and then finally on the DS Lego Battles the real time strategy game for DS alright sounds fascinating
9864927	9867148	DarkSakura, I don't know if you had anything else you wanted to mention.
9868369	9869349	Actually, yes, I did.
9869530	9870710	Because it's about Tekken.
9871111	9871451	Go for it.
9871551	9872751	And I love Tekken.
9872832	9875353	And Loki, we'll go to you with any other E3 things you want to report on.
9875913	9877714	Actually, it's just a report from E3 about Tekken 6.
9877875	9879856	It has a beat-em-up mode.
9880596	9882237	You can go around beating stuff up.
9882958	9886620	Stomp them, smash them, and it has a story with it.
9886640	9888381	And you can use guns and have giant robots.
9889926	9890946	Well, hooray for giant robots.
9890986	9893987	Is that like the whole Tekken 3 had its beat-em-up mode in it?
9894027	9896088	That's what I think.
9898288	9900149	But I mean, I think it's going to be fun.
9900189	9902150	At least it's not like the crazy RPG mode.
9903390	9903650	True.
9905531	9906891	I love me some Tekken.
9910068	9913529	Alright, and some other things that were kind of E3 related.
9914110	9919932	Another part of the Microsoft press conference that they talked about, the new game from Big Park, Joyride.
9920012	9922634	It's a free-to-download kart racing game.
9923442	9924263	Thank you for watching!
9944438	9951280	In fact, to kind of go along with all that stuff, Microsoft has announced their new Summer of Arcade.
9951920	9959522	And with that, a bunch of games coming out, including Splosion Man, which I believe they had a trailer for a while ago, which looked kind of cool.
9959922	9962563	The game from Epic Shadow Complex.
9963563	9967304	TMNT, Turtles in Time, reshelled, the remake of Turtles in Time.
9967424	9968685	That's happy, happy, happy.
9968705	9969085	Yes, please.
9970155	9974338	The HD port of Marvel vs. Capcom 2 coming.
9975238	9982702	Trials HD, which is based off of a Steam game, Trials 2, second edition, that's going to be coming out.
9983223	9988566	And also, to go along with the more telltale games, adventure games...
9989526	9995312	Monkey Island Special Edition, coming out with both remixed and original graphics.
9995672	9997954	Oh, that was a huge thing announced at E3.
9998094	10000597	Who played Monkey Island?
10001257	10001958	I played Monkey Island.
10001978	10006402	That was a huge PC game, the LucasArts series.
10006622	10011407	Well, I mean, I just wanted to know if either of you guys actually played it, because I actually didn't.
10012105	10016087	I didn't play that one, but I played Loom and some of the other ones that LucasArts... Well, Loom.
10016167	10016728	Hell yeah.
10016808	10017488	I love Loom.
10018008	10020170	I love me some Monkey Island there.
10020410	10030836	And I also... Something else that made me kind of happy is not only are they releasing the original Monkey Island and the remixed version, but Telltale is working on
10031616	10032176	and DarkSakura.
10057295	10059837	Avatar's are going to get some interesting stuff.
10060117	10065621	You're going to be able to get unlockable clothing and props for Avatar's based on achievements.
10066141	10070245	And they're showing off some of the ones for ODST which unlocks a costume for your character.
10070785	10073527	So that's kind of cool that they're utilizing them in that sense.
10074908	10075569	That's kind of cool.
10076569	10078231	And yet still no trophy cabinets in Home.
10078271	10084535	Although I will say I did play Home this week and they are slowly making upgrades to what we all thought Home was going to be a year ago.
10084796	10085056	Really?
10085076	10085156	Yeah.
10085970	10087750	Yeah, you can finally put pictures in home.
10087910	10089351	You can import pictures into your home.
10089391	10090431	That's special.
10091471	10091791	Something.
10091991	10092872	Some other stuff.
10093112	10094352	Going back to Microsoft again.
10095512	10099773	Some features they were talking about when they originally were showing off the new Xbox experience.
10100213	10105275	Now you will be able to watch movies with your friends and also do the photo slideshows and stuff like that with your friends.
10105295	10107295	I think you can actually already do the photo slideshows now.
10107695	10109876	But you'll be able to listen to music and stuff with your friends.
10109976	10110136	So...
10111016	10111757	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
10126580	10127360	Let's see here.
10128121	10130341	Also, some other random stuff.
10130981	10137563	Xbox Live Arcade on June 17th will be getting Magic the Gathering as their downloadable title.
10137683	10143105	Magic the Gathering, Duels of Planeswalker will be coming out.
10143965	10147366	So if you're a Magic fan, that's probably pretty exciting news.
10149126	10158189	On the Wii, actually, WiiWare in Japan is getting a new four-player Pokemon fighting game that's coming out on June 16th.
10159469	10167332	No word on exactly how that's going to play, but it looks like gameplay is real-time like Zelda or Ys-type action RPG.
10168092	10172293	And, of course, four players can face off in the game's Battle Royale Arena mode.
10172973	10173153	Huh.
10173773	10174274	Interesting.
10174294	10174334	Um...
10177199	10178219	Let's see here.
10179300	10180040	Team Ico.
10180120	10189844	Remember, I think we talked a little bit last week that they were teasing that there's going to be some Ico download content for LittleBigPlanet.
10189864	10190725	Did they say what it is?
10192946	10205491	Actually, they have some more teaser stuff that go along with it, but apparently it looks like it might actually be a level pack like the Metal Gear Solid stuff.
10206545	10206946	Sweet!
10207126	10208587	I love the Metal Gear Solid level pack.
10208867	10211750	Yeah, so they have some stuff from Media Molecule.
10211850	10213832	It's on their website.
10215474	10220479	Doesn't really show... It says it's Shadow Colossus stuff, I guess, is what it's supposed to be.
10222141	10224683	They don't really... It's just like kind of teaser stuff right now.
10225644	10228207	Trying to pull up their video, see if it actually shows...
10232375	10235396	I don't know, but it looks like it's just going to be Shadow of the Colossus stuff.
10235756	10241098	I don't know if it's actual levels or stuff, but it's at least going to be stickers and costumes.
10241918	10242638	So that's kind of neat.
10243359	10247300	And they have like a Colossus costume and stuff.
10247860	10256063	Tatsunoko vs. Capcom was shown at E3 this year, and they've announced that there's going to be five new characters for North America since they've removed one.
10256363	10258023	And they're taking out the Genie character.
10258623	10260244	So that'll be kind of cool.
10261803	10265085	Perfect Dark being remade for Xbox Live Arcade.
10265125	10268666	We kind of knew that because of all the leaked icons and images and stuff like that.
10269067	10270187	But it has been confirmed now.
10270307	10276850	It's actually being redone or kind of updated, I guess, to run in 1080p.
10277090	10279752	It'll be coming out this fall on Xbox Live Arcade.
10283653	10284514	Let's see here.
10287256	10288076	Some other stuff.
10288336	10290637	They were showing off this game called Cop.
10291237	10294258	The recruit for the DS actually looked pretty cool.
10294278	10297219	It actually looked like kind of the PSP Grand Theft Auto games.
10297619	10301260	That's coming out from Ubisoft I think later this year.
10302020	10302900	So that looked kind of cool.
10305341	10305441	Um...
10308934	10310335	Why don't we take some calls real quick?
10310355	10310435	Sure.
10310455	10313896	We're going to open up the Skype line because, yeah, we're already running into about three hours worth of show.
10313916	10316717	It's about 9.30 here on the West Coast, very late on the East Coast.
10316837	10321719	So I'm going to go ahead and open up the Skype line tonight, try to get some calls out of the way, and then we'll see if Loki has anything else he wants to bring up.
10322119	10328442	Again, if you guys want to share your E3 stories so we can wrap up and get out of here tonight, try to get done before 10 o'clock tonight.
10329082	10329902	Oh, come on.
10330442	10332923	I know, but I kind of have to work really early tomorrow.
10332963	10334184	So we're going to start taking some calls.
10334204	10335584	Remember, two-minute rules in effect tonight.
10336064	10336985	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
10337005	10337365	Who's this?
10338820	10340200	Hey, this is DSMaster26.
10340800	10343061	I'm sorry, was that DSMaster26?
10344081	10344361	Yes.
10344681	10345561	Alright, what's on your mind?
10345601	10347742	Tell us about your E3 thoughts.
10348822	10353363	Well, I watched it online, and of course I also watched the Sony conference.
10353843	10358244	The Microsoft and Nintendo ones blew me away, but Sony?
10359144	10359724	Boring.
10361905	10368506	The biggest disappointment was, okay, you know how they had Chewbacca come out with the PSP 2000 Star Wars pack, right?
10369099	10377741	I can't believe how they did not schedule Miley Cyrus aka Hannah Montana to bring out the Hannah bundle.
10378181	10380682	Seeing as that it got such a huge reception, yeah.
10380722	10387403	But what was it that impressed you more with Microsoft and Nintendo that Sony wasn't delivering on?
10388683	10394404	Like, they showed actual gameplay for Final Fantasy XIII.
10394985	10396905	They showed off, you know,
10397520	10401003	A few songs from Beatles Rock Band, which that was actually kind of awesome.
10402164	10410330	And the Nintendo conference was actually really kind of cool when they showed off the other M, Metroid.
10411230	10413172	I'm like, this is freaking awesome.
10413372	10416154	Was there more than just the Metroid that you enjoyed at a Nintendo's press conference?
10417735	10423360	That was pretty much, well, other than the Resident Evil stuff, but, well, yeah, and Cop.
10424300	10426302	Because I'm like, come on.
10426892	10436322	Rockstar, if Ubisoft can pull off full 3D sandbox game for DS that's similar to GTA, why can't you?
10438044	10439105	Alright, 20 seconds left.
10439145	10441027	Any other thoughts about E3 you want to share?
10442488	10447013	Basically, when I was talking about before my PSP went wonky...
10448653	10455136	If Rock Band's dealing with Lego, I'm betting you full on, somewhere down the line, Guitar Hero's going to pick up on Disney.
10455597	10456877	It's bound to happen.
10457398	10458198	We'll see what happens.
10458258	10458898	All right, time's up.
10459119	10459759	Batav, good one.
10459779	10460439	Thanks for calling in.
10462000	10464301	All right, peace out.
10464321	10464561	Later.
10464581	10465342	1-877-GAME-OLR.
10465442	10467723	Our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
10467863	10468944	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
10468964	10469344	Who's this?
10470805	10471505	Hey, what's up?
10471605	10472546	It's Foodie Monster.
10472606	10474427	Well, long time no see, Foodie Monster.
10474447	10474967	How you doing?
10475711	10476172	How are you doing guys?
10476212	10476692	I'm doing fine.
10476732	10481577	I've actually moved countries, which is why I've been kind of able or something, MIA and stuff.
10481777	10482358	Where are you now?
10483119	10484100	I'm in Chile, actually.
10484380	10485762	Well, congratulations on the move.
10486462	10488344	Alright, so tell us E3 thoughts, quickly.
10489045	10491748	Okay, well, I actually wrote it down so I make it faster for you guys.
10492048	10492589	Let's see.
10493329	10497454	Splinter Cell Conviction, oh my god, that looked incredible, and I'm so happy with the direction they're taking that game.
10498596	10518753	Assassin's Creed 2, love the first one, they promised to give us more diversity and that's exactly what I wanted Project Natal, kind of fucking wait, day one purchase for sure Scribblenauts, amazing, God vs. Kraken, I mean really, that's all you need PSP, excited about Sony, because they're really proving that they can support the platform this way
10519582	10544598	They're showing more stuff, more games, Little Planet, a lot of things, RPGs, and I'm really excited about that Definitely interested about The Last Guardian, that might actually get me to buy a PS3 because that looks great And definitely my best of E3 thing, the best thing that happened in E3 Secret of Monkey Island Special Edition and Telltale's version of Tales from Monkey Island which is going to be the best thing since sliced bread
10545376	10545836	and DarkSakura.com
10575509	10579951	Yeah, actually, I just want to say to all non-believers of point-and-click adventures, fuck you, they're back.
10580412	10580712	Oh, yeah.
10581853	10582193	All right.
10582453	10583433	Well, Woody, thanks for the call.
10583473	10584334	It's a pleasure as always.
10584374	10585735	Call back again when we have more time, okay?
10586355	10586695	Will do.
10586715	10587296	See you guys.
10587436	10587656	Later.
10587676	10590197	1-877-GAME-OLR.
10590257	10592118	Use name on Skype as Orange Lounge Radio.
10592198	10593219	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
10593239	10593619	Who's this?
10594860	10596361	This is Spazinator.
10596381	10597181	Hey, Spazinator.
10597201	10597881	You got two minutes.
10598081	10598582	Three thoughts.
10598642	10598762	Go.
10600573	10606734	Yeah, I was impressed by both Microsoft and Sony's conferences.
10608195	10618897	There's too much stuff to really list out, but both the NATO and the Sony motion controller do look promising.
10618977	10622118	I can't see whether they're going to be good or not.
10622778	10627519	I'm also kind of excited about the Final Fantasy release stuff, too.
10629886	10636668	What do you think, since you're really excited about the motion control, how do you think Nintendo can catch up, or do they need to?
10639909	10642029	I honestly don't know.
10642769	10653692	I really haven't been following Nintendo at all for the past 10 years.
10654472	10658753	I really don't know enough about the Wii to really comment on that.
10660404	10662786	Well, is there any other E3 thoughts you want to comment on tonight, then?
10664247	10665548	No, that's it.
10666189	10667229	Thanks for taking my call.
10667450	10668130	Not a problem.
10668190	10668931	Take care, Spazinator.
10668951	10669351	Have a good one.
10670592	10671132	Yep, you too.
10671513	10672574	Later.
10672594	10673975	1-877-GAME-OLR.
10674095	10676577	Our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
10676617	10687245	If you want to give us a call, please make sure if you do use Skype, you want to test with Echo 123 first before you call, or else your call might sound like crap, and we don't want to have that now, do we?
10688026	10689047	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
10689067	10689407	Who's this?
10690353	10693274	Hey, it's me, Legend of Zaku.
10693394	10694974	Hey, Legend of Zaku.
10695155	10695655	Two minutes.
10695855	10696715	What did you think of E3?
10698396	10698996	Pretty much.
10699996	10708099	Initially, it looks like Microsoft took it, but then again, Sony actually came out and tried very, very close to top them.
10708359	10712060	But Nintendo pretty much came in third.
10713900	10718822	At least it was better than last year's Nintendo Presser, since that was a downer at best.
10720003	10720804	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
10750436	10761520	Anything that they may have not thought of into the development process, well, they still can because they still got, like, what, at least less than a year before they even release it.
10762941	10766662	So they should have plenty of time to work out any final kicks before they market this thing.
10767262	10770724	No one's answered this question yet, and you've got about 40 seconds left.
10770804	10774245	Who do you think is going to be the first one out there, Microsoft or Sony?
10775770	10778871	Yeah, and this is the issue with First to Market.
10780052	10784113	It all depends on whether Sony can get it, can outdo Microsoft.
10784153	10790135	In other words, if Natal is going to get sidelined and delayed, then that works in Sony's favor.
10791296	10799359	And then we'll see that Natal is nothing more than a crock of hyped up shit.
10800619	10803000	Quickly, do you think anyone might rush this and screw up?
10804338	10805200	It depends.
10805460	10811874	I think Sony has done a lot to the point where they could rush this, but they should have a decent product.
10812996	10814860	I'm more worried about Microsoft.
10817513	10819913	We haven't even seen the real thing.
10819933	10823014	We haven't seen the real unit on E3.
10823074	10829996	We only saw pictures of it and trailers and demos that didn't even use the unit itself.
10830376	10830876	Alright, buddy.
10830896	10831596	I've got to let you go.
10831676	10832076	Time's up.
10832176	10833117	Thanks for sharing your thoughts.
10833237	10833677	Have a good one.
10833857	10834057	Later.
10834117	10835937	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
10835957	10836678	Who's this?
10836698	10837198	Hi, it's SSJ100 Matt.
10837218	10837698	Well, hello SSJ100 Matt.
10837758	10838058	Two minutes.
10838078	10838278	Ready?
10838298	10838338	Go!
10848118	10849899	E3 overall, I enjoyed it quite a bit.
10850859	10853680	I enjoyed Sony's conference the most.
10854080	10862144	Well, not really the most, but I enjoyed the, you know, Last Guardian, which actually made me cum a little, not going to lie.
10864805	10865746	Thanks for your honesty.
10866026	10867627	We're listening to KTMI.
10869487	10874390	And I like Mag, and then I could...
10875520	10876680	That's all I could think of at the time.
10876740	10879622	But the thing I wanted to call in about was Natal.
10881782	10883003	I think I mentioned this on Twitter.
10883503	10885704	I 100% agree with you.
10887065	10888665	We should be skeptical of this thing.
10889185	10892146	Because they talk pretty big with tech demo videos.
10893567	10898449	But until we get something tangible, because they didn't really show us anything hands-on.
10900850	10918347	I would like to see what the third party developers are going to do with this and whether or not they can pull something off quick enough that's
10922320	10925302	Now that they have their development kits, which apparently they just got.
10925382	10927164	So that's why I think this thing still weighs out.
10927224	10931567	But quickly, since you don't have a lot of time left, any other thoughts you wanted to share, SSJ?
10934109	10937511	Two things I was kind of disappointed that weren't at E3.
10938852	10944557	I'm disappointed that Microsoft didn't mention anything about X and A, what they plan on doing with that.
10945157	10946318	Oh, that's a damn good point.
10946738	10947119	You're right.
10947139	10948180	There wasn't anything on that.
10948280	10948520	Okay.
10949172	10956237	Because they didn't mention anything about it, and you know... Ah, they're going to kick it to the curb and treat it like the bastard child it is.
10956277	10956958	What's the other thing?
10957999	10962782	And I was wondering, where's Final Fantasy XIII Versus?
10963703	10964423	Good question!
10965324	10966185	Yeah, nowhere to be seen.
10966685	10967546	2011, if we're lucky.
10967886	10970428	Alright, SJ100Mal, we've got to let you go, but thanks for your thoughts.
10971260	10972161	Yep, Boba Fett.
11000868	11003912	The Microsoft seems to be closed down a little more to the community.
11004332	11004633	I don't know.
11004713	11005193	Coincidence?
11005654	11010159	I was looking at... They have a really close-up picture of the Natal camera.
11010780	11012282	And it looks like it's got two...
11013689	11017132	Sensors on it or two actual cameras on it.
11017452	11022195	Almost like I think they're going to detect depth the same way as a human would detect depth.
11022876	11026679	With the differences between the two images and figuring out where you are based on that.
11026739	11028140	I think that's exactly what they're doing.
11028220	11029561	I think you're right on track.
11029581	11032243	I think it's like those stereo images where you stare at it.
11033284	11036426	You know where the two dots come together and you're supposed to see the sail ship and all that?
11037247	11038528	Are you going to be able to see the sailboat?
11039008	11039328	I don't know.
11039369	11039689	I'll try.
11039749	11040690	Let's do one more call, guys.
11041090	11041950	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
11041970	11042271	Who's this?
11043971	11044652	Hello?
11045212	11046314	Hello, who's this?
11047415	11048857	This is Marissa.
11049237	11051159	Hi Marissa, how are you my friend?
11053242	11054163	I'm alright, how are you?
11054203	11059429	I'm sorry, I just had to leave the house for all of these sounds of Call of Duty right now.
11059969	11064535	Well awesome, we're talking about E3 but you've only got two minutes hun, so what's on your mind?
11066054	11071520	I just called to say hello, and the biggest disappointment of E3 was that you did not call me.
11072401	11074523	I know, I'm so sorry, Marissa.
11074583	11075704	I got so busy down there.
11075724	11080308	It was my first trip with my boyfriend and everything, who's from L.A., and we had all this other stuff planned.
11080528	11081249	I'm just teasing you.
11081309	11086754	Actually, the only relevant gamer news to me is that I just found out they're coming out with a C4.
11086795	11087956	It's completely irrelevant.
11089321	11096624	Yes, we will definitely get on that now that all the craziness of our expo is over and we're bored again, at least until PAX.
11119093	11120253	Alright, it sounded wonderful.
11120333	11122354	It was fabulous to hear all the updates.
11122754	11127435	It was in town, but all we LA-ers knew about it was that it kind of fucked up traffic.
11127475	11130495	That's all we know about it.
11130635	11132256	Well, hey, I will be back.
11132856	11135757	I have a pass for Disneyland now, so I'll definitely be back.
11137797	11138717	I will definitely let you know.
11138777	11140217	Maybe an OLR LA meetup.
11140538	11142578	But Marissa, we're going to let you go so we can wrap up our show, okay?
11143470	11145290	Absolutely, and love to Jamie too.
11145590	11147191	Marissa, come up here and hang out with me.
11147231	11148851	Yes, come to Sacramento and be on the show, please.
11149231	11149691	Make it happen.
11150992	11151712	All right, take care, buddy.
11153232	11155152	All right, we're going to go ahead and have that be the last call.
11155172	11157173	I think all the people that were dying to get through got through.
11157493	11158173	We want to wrap up.
11158213	11160013	We're already like three hours and counting tonight.
11160033	11161054	We had a Marissa.
11161234	11162594	I know, it was very nice to hear from her.
11162914	11165575	Loki, did you have anything else you wanted to get out there before we wrap up tonight?
11166315	11168015	Mel, your arcade is actually an arcade game.
11169015	11169355	Apparently.
11169776	11171356	Because I see images of the cabinet now.
11172301	11172941	So that makes sense.
11173021	11174943	Well, there is another Xbox Live Arcade game then.
11175063	11177624	I don't know what it is.
11178765	11179585	Let's see.
11180486	11184789	Smash Brothers Brawl, the user online service is ending.
11185909	11195555	That not being the multiplayer online service, but the service to upload user-generated snapshots, stage designs, and replay data will no longer be available.
11196135	11196716	Why is that?
11196836	11197556	That's kind of sad.
11197736	11198237	No word.
11199678	11200298	No word at all.
11201735	11202235	Interesting.
11202636	11202896	Yes.
11203456	11205437	Something else interesting Smash Bros.
11205537	11206317	Brawl related.
11206697	11211559	Apparently there's a flaw or an exploit that's been discovered in the stage builder.
11211939	11215420	That will allow you to run... Oh yes, you know it.
11216180	11217741	Arbitrary homebrew code.
11218281	11218721	Yes.
11218841	11220322	This is why it's getting closed.
11220922	11221362	Here we go.
11221442	11226344	Another exploit just like Twilight Princess.
11230788	11233172	And then, um, let's see here.
11235295	11239441	And apparently Sony says that E3 is not a proper venue to announce any PS3 price drops.
11241464	11242565	Excuses, excuses.
11244869	11245209	That's it.
11245229	11246351	That's all I got.
11246957	11247918	I'm having a change of heart.
11247958	11249979	I'm opening up the phone line one more time.
11250059	11254061	So if we want to get a couple more calls in, we'll give it just a minute to see if anyone else calls.
11254201	11256843	And we'll give it, again, two-minute rules in effect.
11256863	11261245	1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
11261946	11263286	And then we're going to wrap up.
11263366	11265047	I don't know if we're going to do much of an afterbirth tonight.
11265668	11266128	I really want to.
11267302	11267623	Deathwishing
11287740	11298623	Um, okay, first of all, everyone, get feel, it's a, like, for me, if you're not gonna like it, rent it, because it's just so massive, it's 5,000 square miles of just racing, and it's just...
11300250	11300510	Wow.
11301631	11302111	Interesting.
11302752	11306475	I've heard a lot of negative things about Fuel on the game review sites, but that's now two people.
11306495	11309037	Yeah, like Edge and IGN, but those sites suck anyways.
11309517	11309877	True enough.
11310218	11310798	Okay, I'm sorry.
11310858	11311118	Go ahead.
11311379	11312700	Anyways, here we go with E3.
11312800	11313540	Assassin's Creed 2.
11313720	11314401	I'm just going to show you.
11314461	11315902	If I say, ugh, that means it's good.
11315982	11317143	If I go, aw, that means no.
11317263	11318444	Assassin's Creed 2.
11318724	11319024	Yes.
11321166	11322207	Splinter Cell Conviction.
11322407	11323408	I shit my pants.
11324649	11324749	Um...
11326263	11338870	Halo Reach, I'm actually excited because it's a Halo based on the book Fallout Reach, which is going to explain why there are Spartans and why there's only four.
11339931	11344794	And I'm sorry, but the PS3 motion control looks like a sex toy.
11346535	11347795	You say this like it's a problem.
11348436	11348756	I think it is.
11348776	11350017	It looks like a sex toy.
11350937	11351618	Maybe it is.
11354319	11355420	Why do we have a problem with this?
11356848	11359123	Um, it's gonna give little kids ideas.
11360885	11363166	Well, that's just because their mommy and daddy didn't teach them right.
11364686	11370669	It's just going to encourage people to put glowing balls on their penis and then try to get the thing to follow their penis.
11370689	11371269	Hey, you know what?
11371329	11371749	It's fine.
11371809	11372189	It's fine.
11372829	11375831	For boys, you can put the Wii Vitalize on your wiener.
11375931	11378892	For the girls, you can put the PS3 motion control on your pussy.
11378932	11379612	I'm not finished.
11379912	11380412	Oh, sorry.
11380452	11383093	Project Natal.
11383273	11386855	You know how with Rainbow Six Vegas you could do the facial scan and put your face in the game?
11387635	11387755	Mm-hmm.
11388277	11390798	Now think of Project Assault putting your whole body in the game.
11391959	11397421	Also, remember they showed that little tech demo with Peter Monono and that little child?
11397842	11399442	And remember he needed a drawing?
11399943	11400643	Come on!
11400923	11402624	Someone's going to put their penis on there!
11402724	11403684	It's going to happen!
11403964	11404905	Yeah, I know that.
11405225	11407106	I can't wait to scan my nude body.
11407366	11411248	When you use that in a first person shooter, what's going to happen to the fat guy?
11411268	11412669	He's going to have a bigger hitbox.
11414029	11415710	Alright, quickly, because we talked over your call.
11415730	11417431	I'll give you 15 more seconds to wrap it up.
11421044	11422384	I've been playing 1 vs. 100.
11422444	11423425	You need to join in, Rob.
11423685	11428167	This Tuesday, I think they're having another live episode, the 12th, and I would join in if I were you.
11428488	11429188	I will try to play.
11429208	11430149	I will do my best.
11430189	11430949	Alright, we gotta let you go.
11431069	11431349	Have fun.
11431830	11432350	Bye!
11433751	11438093	I liked his whole uh and buh scale that he didn't even really use.
11439554	11440514	It was fascinating.
11444178	11448099	Marissa asked in chat, what is it with guys and putting their penis everywhere?
11448139	11450339	And Frisbee has the right answer, because they can.
11452540	11454600	We talked about this a little earlier in the show.
11454640	11458281	Hey, I don't do it, but I just report it how I see it.
11458741	11459962	History has proven itself.
11460162	11464043	If it can have a penis put in on it, a penis will be put on it.
11464223	11466283	Folks, we do not make the news.
11466443	11467544	We merely report on it.
11467764	11468904	The cock always wins, huh?
11468924	11471604	All right, on that thought, we've got to go around and get everybody's final thoughts.
11471644	11472665	We're on out of here for tonight.
11472745	11473705	Loki, any final thoughts?
11475488	11476588	I'm glad to be back.
11476608	11477409	I'm tired.
11478269	11480989	My final thought is sleep is awesome.
11481049	11482410	DarkSakura, do you have any final thoughts?
11483210	11484790	My husband didn't bring me a milkshake.
11485370	11486091	I'm disappointed.
11486371	11487991	He's so fired for that.
11488611	11488791	All right.
11488811	11491092	Thank you guys so much for tuning into and downloading our show.
11491132	11492072	We really appreciate it.
11492112	11493912	Thank you for supporting independent podcasting.
11494232	11495233	You guys are amazing.
11495393	11500974	And thank you for staying up late with us tonight and putting up with our crap if you're listening to it on the podcast feed.
11501334	11502374	Getting all the way here to the end.
11502694	11503435	Really appreciate it.
11504175	11505215	Thank you guys again so much.
11505255	11508036	If you like what you hear, please tell two friends about our show.
11508336	11509497	Word of mouth is how we sell it.
11509757	11510737	Thank you guys so much.
11510997	11511898	Have a wonderful night.
11511938	11514078	We will see you next week with more gaming news.
11514118	11517019	Hey, just because E3's over doesn't mean the video game news is stopping.
11517039	11518020	We'll be back next week.
11518420	11526382	Maybe since we'll probably have a lull in the news next week since everybody shot their wad this week, maybe next week we'll be able to play some good old-fashioned OLR games.
11526703	11527823	So look forward to that next week.
11528174	11529796	I think that sounds like a stupendous idea.
11529956	11533321	All right, then stay tuned to next week in another stupendous show.
11534282	11536846	In the meantime, I am the stupendous Rob Roberts.
11536866	11540170	That's the amazing Jamie Summers, and he's the OK Loki.
11540631	11542593	And we'll see you next week here on Orange Launch Radio.
11543234	11546015	You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
