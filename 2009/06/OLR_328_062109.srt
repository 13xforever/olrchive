2
00:00:20,189 --> 00:00:22,391
[SPEAKER_07]: Could the PSP be getting its own app store?

3
00:00:22,832 --> 00:00:25,355
[SPEAKER_07]: And is Activision really going to stop supporting Sony?

4
00:00:31,963 --> 00:00:36,504

00:01:26,182 --> 00:01:27,523
[SPEAKER_11]: And playing Sims 3 again.

17
00:01:27,563 --> 00:01:28,463
[SPEAKER_11]: That's two in a row.

18
00:01:28,503 --> 00:01:30,604
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, yeah, but I'm only doing it in the background.

19
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:31,204
[SPEAKER_01]: No, that's all right.

20
00:01:32,105 --> 00:01:33,145
[SPEAKER_11]: How is Sims life going?

21
00:01:34,046 --> 00:01:43,970
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, for some reason, okay, there's a very small chance of getting knocked up with just plain old woohoo, as in fucking, and it always seems to happen to mine.

22
00:01:44,350 --> 00:01:46,531
[SPEAKER_11]: Whoopee, like they used to say on the newlywed game show.

23
00:01:47,251 --> 00:01:47,511
[SPEAKER_01]: Rob.

24
00:01:47,911 --> 00:01:48,132
[SPEAKER_11]: What?

25
00:01:48,272 --> 00:01:48,792
[SPEAKER_11]: It's fucking.

26
00:01:48,812 --> 00:01:49,132
[SPEAKER_11]: It's fucking.

27
00:01:50,063 --> 00:01:51,705
[SPEAKER_11]: Don't you remember the old newlywed game show?

28
00:01:52,145 --> 00:01:54,047
[SPEAKER_11]: Where's the strangest place you've ever had Whoopi?

29
00:01:54,728 --> 00:01:55,408
[SPEAKER_11]: In the butt, Bob.

30
00:01:58,291 --> 00:02:04,497
[SPEAKER_11]: Also joining us, and I don't want to know the strangest place he's ever had Whoopi because the wife's into porn.

31
00:02:04,517 --> 00:02:05,999
[SPEAKER_11]: Say hello to Tech Master Loki.

32
00:02:06,779 --> 00:02:07,200
[SPEAKER_11]: Hello.

33
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:08,301
[SPEAKER_11]: How are you doing, Loki?

34
00:02:08,341 --> 00:02:08,761
[SPEAKER_11]: Doing good.

35
00:02:08,941 --> 00:02:09,302
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

36
00:02:11,564 --> 00:02:12,605
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know what else to ask you.

37
00:02:12,885 --> 00:02:13,186
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

38
00:02:13,646 --> 00:02:13,966
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyhow.

39
00:02:15,290 --> 00:02:17,152
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

40
00:02:35,405 --> 00:03:01,077
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I played Peggle on iPhone Okay, that's different And it was pretty fun I just played it once and got to the third level, I guess So it was pretty fun I love those types of games, though And, of course, playing Sims 3 Which is pretty cool Okay, people in the modding community Hurry up and fix their damn faces And fix the damn hair I'll give you a dollar Start now

41
00:03:04,594 --> 00:03:11,824
[SPEAKER_01]: and I played Black Knight 2000.

42
00:03:12,745 --> 00:03:13,587
[SPEAKER_11]: The pinball game?

43
00:03:13,727 --> 00:03:14,388
[SPEAKER_01]: The pinball game.

44
00:03:14,548 --> 00:03:16,070
[SPEAKER_11]: I can hear pinball noises, by the way.

45
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:17,732
[SPEAKER_01]: We just got a Lord of the Rings.

46
00:03:17,933 --> 00:03:20,056
[SPEAKER_01]: We got rid of Creature from the Black Lagoon, finally.

47
00:03:20,703 --> 00:03:22,644
[SPEAKER_11]: I liked Creature from the Black Lagoon, but whatever.

48
00:03:24,004 --> 00:03:24,664
[SPEAKER_11]: Machine was a bitch.

49
00:03:24,784 --> 00:03:25,144
[SPEAKER_11]: That's right.

50
00:03:25,905 --> 00:03:31,146
[SPEAKER_11]: It seems like it would be a bitch to maintain because isn't it like the thing where there's a top level and then there's like a see-through underneath that or something?

51
00:03:31,166 --> 00:03:33,327
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just like a hologram and you can just change out the hologram.

52
00:03:33,547 --> 00:03:33,827
[SPEAKER_01]: Interesting.

53
00:03:33,987 --> 00:03:40,649
[SPEAKER_01]: But really, Dan really wanted Lord of the Rings so he said he'd get rid of Creature for Lord of the Rings and the opportunity came up.

54
00:03:40,929 --> 00:03:42,069
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's out there playing it right now.

55
00:03:42,229 --> 00:03:43,650
[SPEAKER_01]: He's been playing it.

56
00:03:43,770 --> 00:03:46,691
[SPEAKER_01]: I know practically every piece of dialogue coming out of that game now.

57
00:03:47,651 --> 00:03:48,031
[SPEAKER_11]: Very nice.

58
00:03:48,684 --> 00:03:56,247
[SPEAKER_01]: and I've been playing a lot of Solitaire and I downloaded a bunch of games for my new netbook.

59
00:03:56,327 --> 00:04:06,911
[SPEAKER_01]: I put Linux Mint on it so I've been exploring the gaming in Linux and actually they've got a bunch of game packages just available to select.

60
00:04:07,211 --> 00:04:11,113
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm playing one called Capman, which is Pac-Man.

61
00:04:12,703 --> 00:04:14,643
[SPEAKER_01]: and Sudoku and some of the little stuff.

62
00:04:14,663 --> 00:04:15,724
[SPEAKER_01]: They have a version of Lode Runner.

63
00:04:16,444 --> 00:04:17,884
[SPEAKER_01]: They have all kinds of neat stuff.

64
00:04:18,224 --> 00:04:20,124
[SPEAKER_01]: As soon as I find kicks, I'll be happy.

65
00:04:21,124 --> 00:04:22,825
[SPEAKER_11]: And you've been enjoying your Linux Mint, I know.

66
00:04:22,865 --> 00:04:26,365
[SPEAKER_11]: You've been talking about installing it on one of your computers for months now.

67
00:04:26,405 --> 00:04:33,787
[SPEAKER_01]: I was going to do the old one, but every time it happened, something would go wrong or the CD had a scratch or some crap.

68
00:04:34,487 --> 00:04:37,587
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I finally just said, you know, fuck it.

69
00:04:37,707 --> 00:04:39,588
[SPEAKER_01]: Completely got rid of...

70
00:04:42,568 --> 00:04:54,033
[SPEAKER_01]: I completely got rid of XP because I hated all the crap that Dell put on it and just like you know what I'm gonna go completely Linux on it and I don't regret it at all.

71
00:04:54,153 --> 00:04:59,015
[SPEAKER_01]: I love having multiple desktops especially on such a small screen and it's been pretty cool.

72
00:04:59,295 --> 00:04:59,635
[SPEAKER_01]: I like it.

73
00:05:00,225 --> 00:05:05,307
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, well, sounds like you've actually been pretty busy with games that weren't The Sims.

74
00:05:05,367 --> 00:05:06,747
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm actually kind of surprised.

75
00:05:07,147 --> 00:05:08,267
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, duh!

76
00:05:08,327 --> 00:05:10,048
[SPEAKER_11]: But then also plenty of Sims 3, I'm sure.

77
00:05:10,208 --> 00:05:12,809
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, yeah.

78
00:05:12,929 --> 00:05:13,769
[SPEAKER_01]: They're making out right now.

79
00:05:13,889 --> 00:05:14,949
[SPEAKER_11]: They're making out right now.

80
00:05:14,969 --> 00:05:18,611
[SPEAKER_11]: I was going to ask you to update the listeners on what's going on in their Sim world right now.

81
00:05:18,651 --> 00:05:24,052
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I actually started over with the same couple because I got tired of them having nothing but girls.

82
00:05:25,493 --> 00:05:27,233
[SPEAKER_01]: They seriously had nothing but girls.

83
00:05:27,733 --> 00:05:29,954
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I started over.

84
00:05:31,515 --> 00:05:36,165
[SPEAKER_01]: I started over and I'm just hoping for a boy.

85
00:05:36,847 --> 00:05:37,809
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, no, they've got a boy now.

86
00:05:37,989 --> 00:05:38,470
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, they do now.

87
00:05:38,510 --> 00:05:39,513
[SPEAKER_01]: If they have a girl now, I don't care.

88
00:05:40,387 --> 00:05:41,948
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, let's move on.

89
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:43,168
[SPEAKER_11]: Loki, how was your gaming week?

90
00:05:44,369 --> 00:05:44,829
[SPEAKER_12]: It was all right.

91
00:05:45,069 --> 00:05:45,670
[SPEAKER_12]: Didn't play much.

92
00:05:45,950 --> 00:05:48,151
[SPEAKER_12]: I played Grand Theft Auto 4 still.

93
00:05:48,791 --> 00:05:56,735
[SPEAKER_12]: And then I also played Saints Row 2 when, you know, obviously live was down on Tuesday for a brief moment.

94
00:05:57,215 --> 00:05:59,536
[SPEAKER_12]: So, well, actually all day.

95
00:06:00,156 --> 00:06:06,139
[SPEAKER_12]: But that meant we had to play something that would allow us to play System Link and Saints Row 2 would be that game.

96
00:06:06,419 --> 00:06:09,601
[SPEAKER_12]: And I kicked the crap out of everybody in Saints Row 2 really bad.

97
00:06:11,842 --> 00:06:19,026
[SPEAKER_12]: I did go back though and play some more Saints Row 2 with the actual download expansions that were available for it.

98
00:06:19,046 --> 00:06:23,909
[SPEAKER_12]: There's only two real paid expansions, so I had already downloaded both of those.

99
00:06:25,069 --> 00:06:26,370
[SPEAKER_12]: And they're okay.

100
00:06:27,987 --> 00:06:35,370
[SPEAKER_12]: There is one escort mission I have to do for escorting some... I have to guard these trucks that are picking up nuclear waste.

101
00:06:36,210 --> 00:06:38,331
[SPEAKER_12]: And, unfortunately, they're really retarded.

102
00:06:38,891 --> 00:06:48,935
[SPEAKER_12]: And they keep, you know, the cops just spawn out of nowhere and just crash straight into the front of the truck and just kind of sit there for a while and does constant damage.

103
00:06:48,975 --> 00:06:53,416
[SPEAKER_12]: So I have had to repeat the mission about eight times and I still haven't passed it yet.

104
00:06:53,576 --> 00:06:54,957
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's really annoying, so...

105
00:06:56,129 --> 00:06:57,230
[SPEAKER_12]: I hate escort missions.

106
00:06:58,150 --> 00:06:58,610
[SPEAKER_12]: All the time.

107
00:06:58,730 --> 00:07:00,171
[SPEAKER_12]: Because the AI is really annoying.

108
00:07:01,312 --> 00:07:04,493
[SPEAKER_12]: And then the rest of the missions are just kind of what you normally expect in the game.

109
00:07:05,734 --> 00:07:10,936
[SPEAKER_12]: Apparently these are the last two actual things that they're adding on there.

110
00:07:13,246 --> 00:07:15,127
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh well, I guess I'm done with Saints Row 2.

111
00:07:16,387 --> 00:07:19,008
[SPEAKER_12]: But then Grand Theft Auto 4, I'm looking to mod it some more.

112
00:07:19,508 --> 00:07:22,289
[SPEAKER_12]: And I've been just waiting to get my computer set up, which I did today.

113
00:07:22,909 --> 00:07:26,170
[SPEAKER_12]: So hopefully later this week I'll be able to tweak it some more.

114
00:07:27,290 --> 00:07:27,630
[SPEAKER_12]: That's it.

115
00:07:28,911 --> 00:07:29,251
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright.

116
00:07:29,971 --> 00:07:31,352
[SPEAKER_11]: How's the house going, by the way?

117
00:07:31,432 --> 00:07:35,773
[SPEAKER_11]: I know we talked a little bit about your new house last week, but now you're getting settled in a little more, probably.

118
00:07:36,204 --> 00:07:39,265
[SPEAKER_12]: Still unpacking, got the internet and cable hooked up and everything.

119
00:07:39,345 --> 00:07:43,966
[SPEAKER_12]: So just still unpacking and trying to get things cleaned up.

120
00:07:44,406 --> 00:07:52,329
[SPEAKER_12]: My mom and my grandparents came over yesterday and they were helping with just some of the stuff I need to get done around the house.

121
00:07:52,449 --> 00:07:57,930
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, patching holes in the wall and painting stuff and that kind of thing.

122
00:07:57,990 --> 00:08:03,032
[SPEAKER_12]: So yeah, it's just a constant project, I guess.

123
00:08:04,012 --> 00:08:04,252
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

124
00:08:05,185 --> 00:08:05,725
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

125
00:08:28,735 --> 00:08:31,336
[SPEAKER_11]: I actually played a game through to completion.

126
00:08:31,856 --> 00:08:32,176
[SPEAKER_11]: I know.

127
00:08:32,196 --> 00:08:32,657
[SPEAKER_03]: What was that?

128
00:08:32,737 --> 00:08:33,397
[SPEAKER_11]: Shock and awe.

129
00:08:33,477 --> 00:08:40,620
[SPEAKER_11]: Because I have this thing called Gaming ADD where I always jump from one game to another spending $60 on one game, never finishing it and going to another.

130
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:44,281
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sure plenty of you are like that because a lot of games take a long time to beat.

131
00:08:44,862 --> 00:08:47,883
[SPEAKER_11]: But the game I beat was Final Fantasy IV The After Years.

132
00:08:48,323 --> 00:08:49,624
[SPEAKER_11]: Although I didn't really beat it.

133
00:08:50,444 --> 00:08:52,185
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

134
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:12,319
[SPEAKER_11]: I want to say two things about the story.

135
00:09:12,699 --> 00:09:17,200
[SPEAKER_11]: One, for a real fan of Final Fantasy IV, this story is great.

136
00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:19,481
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it is a great written sequel.

137
00:09:20,181 --> 00:09:22,061
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's just basing it off the main episode.

138
00:09:22,081 --> 00:09:28,862
[SPEAKER_11]: But even just reading what I've read about the upcoming episodes and so on, I think this story is going to be great and real fan service to fans of the original.

139
00:09:29,162 --> 00:09:33,943
[SPEAKER_11]: But the second thing I want to say about the story is, if you haven't played the original, don't bother with this game.

140
00:09:34,003 --> 00:09:35,523
[SPEAKER_11]: It will not make sense to you.

141
00:09:36,023 --> 00:09:39,044
[SPEAKER_11]: There is so much that references the original Final Fantasy...

142
00:09:39,444 --> 00:09:41,005
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

143
00:10:05,543 --> 00:10:06,244
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

144
00:10:26,585 --> 00:10:30,167
[SPEAKER_11]: and then in Final Fantasy 4 you go underground but the airship can't fly over lava.

145
00:10:30,567 --> 00:10:32,647
[SPEAKER_11]: So then you get the Uber airship that can fly over lava.

146
00:10:32,908 --> 00:10:37,429
[SPEAKER_11]: So, you know, they have ways of restricting where you can go and they definitely do that in this game.

147
00:10:37,469 --> 00:10:39,330
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not all open from the start.

148
00:10:39,410 --> 00:10:43,692
[SPEAKER_11]: But, yeah, I, you know, if you're a fan of the original game you gotta have this game.

149
00:10:43,732 --> 00:10:52,975
[SPEAKER_11]: I know it's taking a lot of crap for the fact that it is episodic and that they are charging, you know, $3 every episode means the game's gonna cost, you know, probably like $30 for all the parts.

150
00:10:53,336 --> 00:10:53,936
[SPEAKER_11]: But you know what?

151
00:10:54,736 --> 00:11:02,324
[SPEAKER_11]: I try to also value my game on how much time I'm getting out of it and how much reward I'm getting from the investment.

152
00:11:02,725 --> 00:11:06,228
[SPEAKER_11]: And honestly, if these three bucks a pop are going to be...

153
00:11:07,748 --> 00:11:08,989
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you for watching!

154
00:11:34,722 --> 00:11:35,983
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's see, other games I've been playing this week.

155
00:11:36,003 --> 00:11:41,165
[SPEAKER_11]: Speaking of old school role-playing games, I was playing Phantasy Star 2 for a good chunk of time this week, right?

156
00:11:41,465 --> 00:11:42,105
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, here's the thing.

157
00:11:42,385 --> 00:11:43,246
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude, I have that game.

158
00:11:43,486 --> 00:11:46,307
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, you know Trixie360 on Twitter, right?

159
00:11:46,367 --> 00:11:47,648
[SPEAKER_11]: Trixie, she's great.

160
00:11:47,728 --> 00:11:48,808
[SPEAKER_01]: She just had her baby, too.

161
00:11:48,828 --> 00:11:49,329
[SPEAKER_01]: Congratulations.

162
00:11:49,369 --> 00:11:49,689
[SPEAKER_11]: She did.

163
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:51,910
[SPEAKER_11]: Congratulations, Trixie, who just had baby Trixie this week.

164
00:11:51,950 --> 00:11:53,891
[SPEAKER_11]: She just spawned this week.

165
00:11:53,911 --> 00:11:54,691
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, she just spawned.

166
00:11:55,271 --> 00:12:05,098
[SPEAKER_11]: But, uh, yeah, she, um, she was giving away codes, and, uh, you know, I just happened to be on Twitter one night when she was giving them away, and I was like, okay, my Google Foo skills are awesome.

167
00:12:05,599 --> 00:12:08,541
[SPEAKER_11]: These little trivia questions she's asking about the 90s, I can do this.

168
00:12:08,641 --> 00:12:09,001
[SPEAKER_11]: I can do this.

169
00:12:09,281 --> 00:12:13,885
[SPEAKER_11]: I do this for the online games I play all the time that don't relate to video games with, like, some of the roleplay I do.

170
00:12:14,746 --> 00:12:22,932
[SPEAKER_11]: I can Google Foo faster than anyone, and sure enough, the second time she gave away a code that I was watching, I won a code for Phantasy Star 2, which...

171
00:12:23,752 --> 00:12:28,533
[SPEAKER_11]: In retrospect, seems a little useless because I do have the Sonic Genesis collection.

172
00:12:28,553 --> 00:12:32,534
[SPEAKER_11]: But I, you know, I wanted to see, did this game offer anything different?

173
00:12:33,194 --> 00:12:35,234
[SPEAKER_11]: And the answer is, not really.

174
00:12:35,454 --> 00:12:38,695
[SPEAKER_11]: Except achievements are in it, for what it's worth.

175
00:12:38,875 --> 00:12:41,735
[SPEAKER_11]: I haven't gotten any yet because you have to get to level 10 to get the first one.

176
00:12:41,775 --> 00:12:46,596
[SPEAKER_11]: I only played... You want to talk about a game, an old school game, where you have to do a lot of freaking grinding?

177
00:12:46,916 --> 00:12:48,016
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, right from the start.

178
00:12:48,296 --> 00:12:50,877
[SPEAKER_11]: You can't really go anywhere until you grind your way to level 3 or 4.

179
00:12:50,937 --> 00:12:52,537
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to start off poor.

180
00:12:52,737 --> 00:12:54,179
[SPEAKER_11]: I've actually got a figure of her.

181
00:12:54,199 --> 00:12:54,680
[SPEAKER_11]: The one that turned out

182
00:13:07,895 --> 00:13:08,576
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, don't spoil.

183
00:13:08,696 --> 00:13:11,799
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just kidding.

184
00:13:11,919 --> 00:13:12,660
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I know.

185
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:13,300
[SPEAKER_01]: 20 years old.

186
00:13:14,862 --> 00:13:15,322
[SPEAKER_11]: Not true.

187
00:13:15,723 --> 00:13:17,745
[SPEAKER_11]: Because I never played it on the Genesis.

188
00:13:18,085 --> 00:13:24,712
[SPEAKER_11]: But granted, I could have gotten it on PlayStation 1 or any of the millions of times they've re-released this game.

189
00:13:25,072 --> 00:13:27,194
[SPEAKER_11]: But for whatever reason, I'm just now playing it.

190
00:13:27,254 --> 00:13:28,575
[SPEAKER_01]: She actually doesn't turn out evil.

191
00:13:28,615 --> 00:13:30,197
[SPEAKER_01]: It's something else weird that happens to her.

192
00:13:30,497 --> 00:13:31,198
[SPEAKER_01]: Ah, okay.

193
00:13:31,218 --> 00:13:32,019
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not really...

194
00:13:32,239 --> 00:13:32,599
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.

195
00:13:33,359 --> 00:13:34,760
[SPEAKER_11]: I've barely been paying attention to the story.

196
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:36,941
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you want my little figurine, you can have it, because she's cute.

197
00:13:37,521 --> 00:13:37,761
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe.

198
00:13:37,821 --> 00:13:38,401
[SPEAKER_01]: She's a cat girl.

199
00:13:39,001 --> 00:13:40,202
[SPEAKER_11]: I've been having fun with it so far.

200
00:13:40,622 --> 00:13:41,722
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll have to play a little more.

201
00:13:42,002 --> 00:13:46,244
[SPEAKER_11]: There are leaderboards, too, which is something a little extra you don't have in the Mega Genesis Collection.

202
00:13:46,784 --> 00:13:53,226
[SPEAKER_11]: And also, the smoothing is in both, but the save system's a little different, but that's not really anything to hoop and holler about.

203
00:13:53,546 --> 00:13:56,847
[SPEAKER_11]: You can save anywhere in the game, though, and I don't remember.

204
00:13:56,867 --> 00:13:59,908
[SPEAKER_11]: I didn't play it enough in the Mega Collection to know if that was the case.

205
00:14:00,328 --> 00:14:07,778
[SPEAKER_11]: I think for anybody that owns a collection, there really probably isn't much point to having this game unless you really want achievements or you are just that much of a fan of the system.

206
00:14:07,798 --> 00:14:11,823
[SPEAKER_12]: I kind of wonder why they decided to release that collection if they were planning to release these games.

207
00:14:11,863 --> 00:14:13,565
[SPEAKER_12]: It would seem to me that it would be a good idea to...

208
00:14:14,329 --> 00:14:15,750
[SPEAKER_12]: Suck in all the money that you can, then BOOM!

209
00:14:15,790 --> 00:14:15,990
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, yeah.

210
00:14:37,006 --> 00:14:38,487
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyway, Phantasy Star 2 is alright.

211
00:14:38,627 --> 00:14:42,971
[SPEAKER_11]: If you haven't played it one of the million other ways you can get that game, then it's worth checking out.

212
00:14:43,011 --> 00:14:47,735
[SPEAKER_11]: It is a piece of gaming history known for its notoriety of being an incredibly difficult RPG.

213
00:14:48,356 --> 00:14:49,537
[SPEAKER_01]: God, seriously though.

214
00:14:50,017 --> 00:14:53,600
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's actually one of the best Sega RPGs out.

215
00:14:54,101 --> 00:14:55,802
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's why they've released it so many times.

216
00:14:57,063 --> 00:14:59,726
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure that people who want it can get it.

217
00:15:00,106 --> 00:15:00,246
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

218
00:15:01,249 --> 00:15:02,369
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, let's see.

219
00:15:03,049 --> 00:15:03,930
[SPEAKER_11]: What else have I been playing this week?

220
00:15:03,950 --> 00:15:04,770
[SPEAKER_11]: I've actually been playing a lot.

221
00:15:04,830 --> 00:15:06,590
[SPEAKER_11]: Fuel is another game I've checked out.

222
00:15:06,610 --> 00:15:09,271
[SPEAKER_11]: This is something that Loki was raving about on the show a couple weeks ago.

223
00:15:09,771 --> 00:15:13,032
[SPEAKER_11]: I mentioned that I touched the game last week, but I hadn't really played a lot.

224
00:15:13,392 --> 00:15:15,412
[SPEAKER_11]: I've spent a lot more time with Fuel this week.

225
00:15:15,612 --> 00:15:19,413
[SPEAKER_11]: And, you know, I think, honestly, you're going to have to file this game and love it or hate it.

226
00:15:19,653 --> 00:15:23,014
[SPEAKER_11]: Because I've been trying to look at some of the mainstream reviews, which I don't usually do.

227
00:15:23,414 --> 00:15:27,915
[SPEAKER_11]: But I've been trying to figure out why the game has not been scoring kind of better as a whole.

228
00:15:28,255 --> 00:15:30,136
[SPEAKER_11]: Because I think there is a lot to this game.

229
00:15:31,896 --> 00:15:33,678
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it's really just a love it or hate it type of game.

230
00:15:34,018 --> 00:15:37,021
[SPEAKER_11]: There are some pretty in-your-face type of flaws with the game.

231
00:15:37,061 --> 00:15:41,827
[SPEAKER_11]: There is some graphical clipping that is just like, oh my gosh, did I really just drive right through that tree?

232
00:15:42,087 --> 00:15:43,408
[SPEAKER_11]: Did that really just happen?

233
00:15:43,428 --> 00:15:44,790
[SPEAKER_11]: There are some big flaws.

234
00:15:45,491 --> 00:15:48,574
[SPEAKER_11]: I feel like this game was slightly rushed.

235
00:15:48,774 --> 00:15:49,815
[SPEAKER_11]: If they just spent...

236
00:15:50,396 --> 00:15:50,957
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

237
00:16:12,816 --> 00:16:13,256
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, the GPS.

238
00:16:36,795 --> 00:16:44,802
[SPEAKER_11]: or all these liveries on your GPS or you can actually run into cars and get the car a little later on when you unlock the second area.

239
00:16:44,822 --> 00:16:45,342
[SPEAKER_11]: You can do that.

240
00:16:46,363 --> 00:16:47,564
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's kind of neat.

241
00:16:48,885 --> 00:16:51,547
[SPEAKER_11]: A lot for somebody who likes to collect things in games.

242
00:16:51,948 --> 00:16:52,829
[SPEAKER_11]: Did you?

243
00:16:53,029 --> 00:16:54,210
[SPEAKER_11]: Arcade style controls.

244
00:16:54,290 --> 00:16:56,712
[SPEAKER_12]: Did you try driving from the first camp to the second camp?

245
00:16:56,732 --> 00:16:57,973
[SPEAKER_11]: You know I have a funny story about that.

246
00:16:58,013 --> 00:17:03,457
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes I did because I wanted to get that achievement because I looked at what achievements you had got and I figured well anything Loki has I can get.

247
00:17:04,278 --> 00:17:09,101
[SPEAKER_11]: So I actually tried to get that achievement, and the funny thing is I didn't finish it because I got fooled.

248
00:17:09,541 --> 00:17:15,004
[SPEAKER_11]: As I was driving there, and right when I crossed into that second zone, it said, oh, achievement unlocked.

249
00:17:15,324 --> 00:17:18,385
[SPEAKER_11]: And I was like, oh, well, I guess I don't really have to drive all the way into the base camp.

250
00:17:18,405 --> 00:17:18,906
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, that's cool.

251
00:17:18,926 --> 00:17:19,306
[SPEAKER_11]: That's easy.

252
00:17:19,326 --> 00:17:21,887
[SPEAKER_11]: You just have to drive from the one map line to the other.

253
00:17:22,288 --> 00:17:22,608
[SPEAKER_11]: Whoops.

254
00:17:22,908 --> 00:17:27,890
[SPEAKER_11]: The achievement I found out later that I really got was the one for driving 100 miles cumulatively.

255
00:17:28,231 --> 00:17:29,871
[SPEAKER_11]: I just happened to get it at that moment.

256
00:17:30,432 --> 00:17:32,033
[SPEAKER_11]: And so now I'm going to have to go back and do it again.

257
00:17:33,093 --> 00:17:37,117
[SPEAKER_12]: It's cool though because you drive through a forest fire while you're going there.

258
00:17:37,157 --> 00:17:38,958
[SPEAKER_11]: That's where I actually unlocked it.

259
00:17:39,619 --> 00:17:41,540
[SPEAKER_11]: They have done some pretty imaginative things with the game.

260
00:17:41,961 --> 00:17:43,102
[SPEAKER_11]: I just don't think it's for everyone.

261
00:17:43,122 --> 00:17:46,504
[SPEAKER_11]: I think there's a lot of people that are going to pick this up and go, what the hell's the point?

262
00:17:47,505 --> 00:17:48,166
[SPEAKER_11]: What am I doing?

263
00:17:49,867 --> 00:17:53,910
[SPEAKER_11]: The game is not kind into kind of a ramp up learning curve.

264
00:17:54,431 --> 00:17:55,952
[SPEAKER_11]: You just are kind of thrown into it.

265
00:17:56,132 --> 00:17:57,533
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, so what do I do?

266
00:17:58,174 --> 00:18:00,336
[SPEAKER_11]: You're kind of like, do I drive around aimlessly?

267
00:18:00,516 --> 00:18:01,056
[SPEAKER_11]: Do I...

268
00:18:01,897 --> 00:18:03,698
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

269
00:18:27,475 --> 00:18:30,997
[SPEAKER_11]: But I thought maybe this was because I was adventuring out in the middle of nowhere in the second world.

270
00:18:31,418 --> 00:18:33,699
[SPEAKER_11]: Or second section of the map that you unlock.

271
00:18:34,019 --> 00:18:35,920
[SPEAKER_11]: So maybe everybody's in the first area.

272
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:36,301
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

273
00:18:36,321 --> 00:18:37,962
[SPEAKER_11]: Or maybe it was because I was playing at 1 a.m.

274
00:18:38,022 --> 00:18:38,462
[SPEAKER_11]: on Saturday.

275
00:18:38,942 --> 00:18:39,403
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

276
00:18:39,843 --> 00:18:41,864
[SPEAKER_11]: But I didn't run into anybody.

277
00:18:42,104 --> 00:18:43,765
[SPEAKER_11]: But I did try some of the Xbox Live races.

278
00:18:46,812 --> 00:18:47,313
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

279
00:19:06,414 --> 00:19:08,395
[SPEAKER_12]: And it was like hardly anything on the map.

280
00:19:08,435 --> 00:19:09,815
[SPEAKER_12]: We got to a new area and that was it.

281
00:19:09,956 --> 00:19:13,717
[SPEAKER_11]: You actually, you can get further faster if you're smart about the way you do it.

282
00:19:13,817 --> 00:19:17,659
[SPEAKER_11]: If you drive on the freeways with a freeway vehicle, you'll go really fast.

283
00:19:17,959 --> 00:19:23,001
[SPEAKER_11]: But if you try to just go from point A to B off-road, like as the crow flies, you're not going to get there as fast.

284
00:19:23,321 --> 00:19:28,063
[SPEAKER_11]: You really do have to take the freeways and the bullet car and go 110 miles an hour to get places faster.

285
00:19:28,543 --> 00:19:30,344
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just, you know, you're so tempted.

286
00:19:30,384 --> 00:19:32,425
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, I just want to drive off-road, you know.

287
00:19:32,625 --> 00:19:33,085
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

288
00:19:52,052 --> 00:19:53,713
[SPEAKER_11]: Some of it gets a little annoying.

289
00:19:53,913 --> 00:19:56,054
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, some of the challenges that are just endurance.

290
00:19:56,174 --> 00:19:57,974
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, it's a 15-minute race.

291
00:19:58,315 --> 00:19:59,095
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not even joking.

292
00:19:59,395 --> 00:20:00,675
[SPEAKER_11]: From one point to another.

293
00:20:00,976 --> 00:20:06,218
[SPEAKER_11]: And then to, like, come in second on that 15-minute race and get nothing for it is a little frustrating.

294
00:20:06,418 --> 00:20:08,679
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, you don't get a silver medal or anything.

295
00:20:08,739 --> 00:20:09,559
[SPEAKER_11]: It's like, oh, you lose.

296
00:20:09,579 --> 00:20:10,159
[SPEAKER_11]: Do you want to try again?

297
00:20:10,179 --> 00:20:12,140
[SPEAKER_12]: Or the chasing the copter thing and you're just like...

298
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:14,042
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, I took the wrong turn.

299
00:20:14,542 --> 00:20:14,843
[SPEAKER_12]: Crap.

300
00:20:15,023 --> 00:20:15,323
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

301
00:20:15,724 --> 00:20:18,387
[SPEAKER_11]: There are some areas like that where it's like, come on.

302
00:20:19,328 --> 00:20:27,258
[SPEAKER_11]: That is like one big thing I would have fixed is I would have given some type of reward for second and third place or give me a reason to waste 15 minutes, you know?

303
00:20:27,878 --> 00:20:28,078
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

304
00:20:28,099 --> 00:20:29,000
[SPEAKER_11]: So, yeah.

305
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:32,922
[SPEAKER_11]: But otherwise, there's a lot of collectible to it.

306
00:20:33,202 --> 00:20:33,883
[SPEAKER_11]: I will play it again.

307
00:20:33,903 --> 00:20:35,383
[SPEAKER_11]: I've got to play with Loki online at some point.

308
00:20:35,644 --> 00:20:38,305
[SPEAKER_11]: We're going to have a race to drive from one point to another.

309
00:20:39,106 --> 00:20:39,726
[SPEAKER_11]: It would be cool.

310
00:20:40,967 --> 00:20:41,267
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll see.

311
00:20:41,727 --> 00:20:47,330
[SPEAKER_11]: Gosh, I've talked a lot about games, but I've had time to play them again thanks to not playing WoW.

312
00:20:47,811 --> 00:20:48,971
[SPEAKER_11]: So there you go.

313
00:20:49,131 --> 00:20:49,652
[SPEAKER_11]: I guess that's it.

314
00:20:49,872 --> 00:20:51,233
[SPEAKER_11]: That's all I'm going to share for my gaming week.

315
00:20:51,253 --> 00:20:53,034
[SPEAKER_11]: I know there's been some other stuff, but that's all I want to share.

316
00:20:53,414 --> 00:20:54,975
[SPEAKER_11]: I want to actually get into some gaming news.

317
00:20:55,375 --> 00:20:56,416
[SPEAKER_11]: First, some housekeeping.

318
00:20:57,389 --> 00:20:57,930
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

319
00:21:18,487 --> 00:21:39,749
[SPEAKER_11]: essentially no break and when I say no break granted of course we've had a week off here and there for holidays or trips or travel or what have you but honestly there's never been a break longer than I think our longest downtime was three weeks once and that was like a one-time thing that happened but we've been going like non-stop ever since I don't even think it was three weeks I think it was two weeks when like we were moving out of

320
00:21:40,269 --> 00:21:42,210
[SPEAKER_11]: One... Like, remember when Loki and I used to live together?

321
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:42,811
[SPEAKER_03]: We did the show there?

322
00:21:42,831 --> 00:21:43,471
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's about it.

323
00:21:43,531 --> 00:21:49,034
[SPEAKER_11]: I think when we moved from that to the new setup, I think that was our longest break we had, because it was such a big move.

324
00:21:49,514 --> 00:21:52,436
[SPEAKER_11]: So... But yeah, seven years of Orange Launch Radio, believe it or not.

325
00:21:52,456 --> 00:21:56,959
[SPEAKER_11]: When we started doing this show, I was just about to have my 24th birthday.

326
00:21:57,439 --> 00:22:02,862
[SPEAKER_11]: I was 23 years old, and now I'm gonna be... It's funny enough, OLR started three days before my birthday.

327
00:22:03,102 --> 00:22:04,763
[SPEAKER_11]: So now I'm turning 31 this week.

328
00:22:05,063 --> 00:22:06,764
[SPEAKER_11]: That's a long time of doing this show.

329
00:22:07,324 --> 00:22:07,545
[SPEAKER_11]: But...

330
00:22:08,605 --> 00:22:09,546
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, they're still going.

331
00:22:09,566 --> 00:22:10,227
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what?

332
00:22:10,887 --> 00:22:12,529
[SPEAKER_01]: Things get the best when you're in your 30s.

333
00:22:12,569 --> 00:22:13,150
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I say.

334
00:22:13,250 --> 00:22:13,650
[SPEAKER_11]: That's right.

335
00:22:14,130 --> 00:22:20,236
[SPEAKER_11]: So, okay, and we'll be actually having more of a celebration, quote unquote, next week, although we have nothing special planned.

336
00:22:20,717 --> 00:22:21,738
[SPEAKER_11]: So, I don't know.

337
00:22:21,858 --> 00:22:26,282
[SPEAKER_11]: When you start to get a certain age, you kind of hope other people will throw you a surprise party so you don't have to do any work.

338
00:22:26,402 --> 00:22:26,862
[SPEAKER_11]: No, I'm kidding.

339
00:22:27,243 --> 00:22:28,584
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know what there is to do.

340
00:22:30,746 --> 00:22:36,030
[SPEAKER_11]: So certainly we'll open up the Skype line to your calls about the show, maybe share some favorite moments.

341
00:22:36,711 --> 00:22:46,798
[SPEAKER_11]: Some of you guys, I would love, some of you guys that are archive experts of the show, dig up some of your favorite moments that are out there and available, and we'll try to replay some of them next week if we can find any.

342
00:22:47,179 --> 00:22:48,179
[SPEAKER_11]: So there you go.

343
00:22:48,860 --> 00:22:49,761
[SPEAKER_11]: Seven years next week.

344
00:22:51,155 --> 00:22:54,276
[SPEAKER_11]: TigerClaw points out, and I've been ignoring chat all night, I apologize.

345
00:22:54,616 --> 00:22:59,018
[SPEAKER_11]: TigerClaw points out, today is a holiday, well sort of, of course, Father's Day.

346
00:22:59,418 --> 00:23:06,501
[SPEAKER_11]: So to all of our gaming dads out there today, happy Father's Day to you, or whatever father figure happens to be in your life.

347
00:23:06,561 --> 00:23:08,482
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe a grandpa or a brother, I don't know.

348
00:23:08,542 --> 00:23:11,283
[SPEAKER_11]: So happy Father's Day to all of you fatherly figures out there.

349
00:23:11,783 --> 00:23:17,185
[SPEAKER_11]: And as TigerClaw says in chat, today is a holiday, well sort of, happy about to be a Father's Day for Loki.

350
00:23:17,845 --> 00:23:19,747
[SPEAKER_11]: since as we all know the wife is Prager's.

351
00:23:20,388 --> 00:23:22,150
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, they celebrated it for me anyway.

352
00:23:22,170 --> 00:23:24,112
[SPEAKER_12]: They got a shop vac, which is awesome.

353
00:23:24,212 --> 00:23:24,572
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, nice.

354
00:23:24,952 --> 00:23:25,533
[SPEAKER_12]: Power tools.

355
00:23:26,374 --> 00:23:27,415
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I need the shop vac.

356
00:23:27,435 --> 00:23:28,556
[SPEAKER_11]: Like any good father should have.

357
00:23:28,656 --> 00:23:29,097
[SPEAKER_11]: So there you go.

358
00:23:30,205 --> 00:23:32,886
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, well, let's get into the show tonight.

359
00:23:33,006 --> 00:23:36,527
[SPEAKER_11]: And for those that listened last week, which I hope you all did, it was on the podcast feed.

360
00:23:36,547 --> 00:23:38,468
[SPEAKER_11]: Our podcast feed's been on time lately.

361
00:23:39,608 --> 00:23:41,929
[SPEAKER_11]: We have kind of changed the format of our show a little bit.

362
00:23:42,389 --> 00:23:45,010
[SPEAKER_11]: Less stories, more time with each story.

363
00:23:45,070 --> 00:23:50,812
[SPEAKER_11]: Because, you know, you guys can go on and, you know, kind of get a rundown of the gaming news on hundreds of different websites.

364
00:23:51,212 --> 00:23:55,053
[SPEAKER_11]: But this is one of the only places where you can really talk about them with other gamers who aren't jerks.

365
00:23:55,653 --> 00:23:57,594
[SPEAKER_11]: And leave comments that say, first...

366
00:23:58,979 --> 00:24:00,700
[SPEAKER_11]: So let's talk about this week in gaming news.

367
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:04,581
[SPEAKER_11]: There's been some big stories this week, especially a huge one.

368
00:24:05,161 --> 00:24:08,622
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura is going to start us off tonight with some gaming news to talk about.

369
00:24:08,762 --> 00:24:10,543
[SPEAKER_11]: And your call is at 877-GAME-OLR.

370
00:24:10,783 --> 00:24:18,186
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we have a case of it could be a business decision or it could just be a case of pissy bitchiness.

371
00:24:18,866 --> 00:24:19,286
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

372
00:24:19,546 --> 00:24:21,087
[SPEAKER_01]: Activision's got some PMS going on.

373
00:24:21,867 --> 00:24:26,829
[SPEAKER_01]: They just say they might stop supporting Sony.

374
00:24:27,589 --> 00:24:41,934
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, their CEO, Bobby Kotick, said that they would have to cut the price because they wouldn't be able to make the games that people would buy because the console is too expensive.

375
00:24:42,914 --> 00:24:49,797
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, I think there's a certain amount of cost that goes into doing anything for Sony because they've got some pretty expensive rates.

376
00:24:50,657 --> 00:24:56,178
[SPEAKER_01]: I said that they might just have to stop supporting Sony come 2010-2011.

377
00:24:56,419 --> 00:25:02,360
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're also considering not just the PS3, but the PSP as well.

378
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:11,222
[SPEAKER_01]: They pay $500 million in royalties to Sony, which is roughly about 40% of their profit.

379
00:25:12,042 --> 00:25:14,203
[SPEAKER_01]: So under those circumstances...

380
00:25:15,784 --> 00:25:25,693
[SPEAKER_01]: I kind of don't blame them if they're trying to really make back their money honestly Xbox and Wii is going to be where it's at for Activision I would think

381
00:25:28,064 --> 00:25:28,824
[SPEAKER_11]: Loki, you agree?

382
00:25:29,004 --> 00:25:30,965
[SPEAKER_11]: It won't happen.

383
00:25:31,566 --> 00:25:35,547
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know if I totally agree with the whole it's only there on Xbox and Wii.

384
00:25:35,847 --> 00:25:36,348
[SPEAKER_11]: I get it.

385
00:25:36,588 --> 00:25:37,408
[SPEAKER_11]: I get that sentiment.

386
00:25:37,728 --> 00:25:42,170
[SPEAKER_11]: But I do think you have your hardcore Sony audience that would justify the cost of porting the game.

387
00:25:42,330 --> 00:25:47,712
[SPEAKER_12]: Bobby Kotick has been bitching about the Sony PS3 price for a long time now.

388
00:25:48,193 --> 00:25:53,075
[SPEAKER_12]: Every time you hear about some Activision bitching about the price of the PS3, they think it's too high.

389
00:25:53,315 --> 00:25:54,695
[SPEAKER_12]: They think there should be a price drop.

390
00:25:54,715 --> 00:25:55,996
[SPEAKER_12]: They're hoping there's a price drop.

391
00:25:56,736 --> 00:25:58,738
[SPEAKER_12]: They're always complaining about the PS3 price.

392
00:25:58,778 --> 00:25:59,318
[SPEAKER_12]: And you know what?

393
00:25:59,338 --> 00:26:05,482
[SPEAKER_12]: They don't sell as many units on the PS3 as they do on the 360, but they still sell quite a bit.

394
00:26:06,142 --> 00:26:12,307
[SPEAKER_12]: And I'm sorry, but you're going to just cost average everything across the board for most of the games you develop.

395
00:26:14,105 --> 00:26:16,887
[SPEAKER_12]: Hey, if you don't want to develop for the PS3, then don't.

396
00:26:17,027 --> 00:26:29,095
[SPEAKER_12]: But I think franchises like Modern Warfare 2 and Guitar Hero and stuff, the PS3 is still a very integral part of those franchises.

397
00:26:29,615 --> 00:26:35,519
[SPEAKER_12]: And to just get rid of it because, oh, it's too expensive, well, that's not really a good reason.

398
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:39,222
[SPEAKER_12]: Although, let's just say if they are crazy enough and they actually go through with it,

399
00:26:40,737 --> 00:26:42,438
[SPEAKER_12]: That's going to suck for Sony.

400
00:26:42,998 --> 00:26:46,240
[SPEAKER_12]: And that's going to be something I don't know if they can be able to make up ground on.

401
00:26:47,041 --> 00:26:47,641
[SPEAKER_11]: Empty threats?

402
00:26:48,301 --> 00:26:48,782
[SPEAKER_11]: Probably.

403
00:26:50,282 --> 00:26:51,003
[SPEAKER_11]: What do you guys think?

404
00:26:51,023 --> 00:26:54,965
[SPEAKER_11]: 1-877-GAME-OLR or a username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

405
00:26:54,985 --> 00:26:56,226
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'm reading the chat room here.

406
00:26:56,586 --> 00:26:58,127
[SPEAKER_11]: Ranma says, good for Activision.

407
00:26:59,031 --> 00:27:12,303
[SPEAKER_12]: Now, from what I heard, or remember reading, EA, I guess, I don't know if maybe EA dropped, or Sega, they weren't supporting the Genesis or something like that at one time.

408
00:27:12,544 --> 00:27:15,466
[SPEAKER_12]: Like, EA had dropped them for similar reasons.

409
00:27:17,628 --> 00:27:18,789
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know, it'd be interesting.

410
00:27:18,809 --> 00:27:20,511
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't think that's going to happen, though.

411
00:27:20,871 --> 00:27:24,615
[SPEAKER_12]: Because, I mean, all it would take is something like that to happen, you know, say...

412
00:27:26,623 --> 00:27:38,349
[SPEAKER_12]: Activision has stopped publishing Guitar Hero on the PS3 and boom, Rock Band will come in and swoop up all those sales right there.

413
00:27:38,470 --> 00:27:42,131
[SPEAKER_12]: Modern Warfare 2, I'm sure there's going to be another military shooter out there.

414
00:27:42,952 --> 00:27:46,354
[SPEAKER_12]: If not first party, then someone else putting something out.

415
00:27:47,114 --> 00:28:07,647
[SPEAKER_12]: and um I don't know it's not gonna just like it's not gonna just kill them for not having Activision there's a couple listeners in chat that want to say it's the Dreamcast that EA dropped oh Dreamcast okay okay that's what it was um I just I knew it was the Sega system but I couldn't remember which one um so yeah I mean I I doubt that at this point they're gonna do that

416
00:28:09,686 --> 00:28:11,007
[SPEAKER_11]: There is a response from Sony.

417
00:28:11,188 --> 00:28:15,832
[SPEAKER_11]: Obviously, this thing caught so much momentum around the internet that Sony had to make a response, and they did.

418
00:28:16,152 --> 00:28:17,633
[SPEAKER_11]: And the response goes something like this.

419
00:28:18,073 --> 00:28:28,762
[SPEAKER_11]: PlayStation has tremendous momentum coming out of E3, and we are seeing positive growth with more than 350 titles slated to hit across all of our platforms, including many anticipated games from our publishing partners.

420
00:28:29,363 --> 00:28:33,647
[SPEAKER_11]: And this, by the way, this quote is from Patrick Sebold, who is a spokesperson for PlayStation.

421
00:28:34,267 --> 00:28:41,831
[SPEAKER_11]: We enjoy healthy business relationships with and greatly value our publishing partners, and we are working closely with them to deliver the best entertainment experience.

422
00:28:42,231 --> 00:28:44,012
[SPEAKER_11]: So in other words, they didn't really address the issue.

423
00:28:44,632 --> 00:28:49,695
[SPEAKER_11]: They just kind of said, we still are awesome, and we're just going to ignore this guy because he's a boob.

424
00:28:49,895 --> 00:28:51,816
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, he may be a boob.

425
00:28:51,876 --> 00:28:52,856
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, who knows?

426
00:28:53,537 --> 00:28:53,997
[SPEAKER_12]: He's kind of...

427
00:28:55,938 --> 00:28:57,419
[SPEAKER_12]: He seems to whine a lot, I guess.

428
00:28:58,079 --> 00:29:02,043
[SPEAKER_12]: And it really doesn't matter if he thinks there should be a price drop.

429
00:29:02,223 --> 00:29:05,625
[SPEAKER_12]: They shouldn't have to drop their price because he thinks there should be a price drop.

430
00:29:05,986 --> 00:29:06,506
[SPEAKER_12]: Fuck him.

431
00:29:06,566 --> 00:29:07,587
[SPEAKER_12]: He doesn't work for Sony.

432
00:29:09,482 --> 00:29:11,023
[SPEAKER_12]: DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

433
00:29:32,659 --> 00:29:33,259
[SPEAKER_12]: and so on and so forth.

434
00:30:01,688 --> 00:30:04,710
[SPEAKER_12]: I think that they're working on something similar to that with the PS3 as well.

435
00:30:05,010 --> 00:30:15,676
[SPEAKER_12]: Maybe that might be something that they can look at as an option to save some money for the third-party publishers and give them a reason to develop more on the PS3, but it's not a reason to drop them.

436
00:30:16,476 --> 00:30:17,157
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you for watching!

437
00:30:33,311 --> 00:30:37,012
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know though, because didn't a few companies leave ESA, but not everybody did?

438
00:30:37,192 --> 00:30:49,316
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't think necessarily one, and Activision was kind of, that's one reason I almost would believe this guy if he's a boob or not, is that Activision did drop ESA for a while, didn't they?

439
00:30:49,876 --> 00:30:50,036
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

440
00:30:58,378 --> 00:31:03,223
[SPEAKER_11]: We have to set up freaking queues on our website to handle the load and they're gone in 15 minutes.

441
00:31:03,483 --> 00:31:06,165
[SPEAKER_11]: We don't need it.

442
00:31:07,006 --> 00:31:16,454
[SPEAKER_11]: On one hand, despite the thought that I'm kind of torn, I'm like, yeah, it sounds like an empty threat, but at the same time, track record shows Activision is willing to make good on these type of threats.

443
00:31:16,714 --> 00:31:17,155
[SPEAKER_11]: You know what I mean?

444
00:31:18,359 --> 00:31:20,581
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, he doesn't even have a time frame.

445
00:31:20,681 --> 00:31:21,061
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, 2010, 2011.

446
00:31:21,922 --> 00:31:28,167
[SPEAKER_12]: If you do not drop your price by December 31st, 2009, we will be gone June 1st, 2010.

447
00:31:28,287 --> 00:31:30,268
[SPEAKER_11]: That seems like a closed-door conversation, though.

448
00:31:30,288 --> 00:31:30,889
[SPEAKER_11]: You know what I mean?

449
00:31:31,829 --> 00:31:34,652
[SPEAKER_11]: Part of me wonders, though, is this much ado about nothing?

450
00:31:34,992 --> 00:31:39,996
[SPEAKER_11]: Did this guy make an offhanded remark, a soundbite, if you will?

451
00:31:40,276 --> 00:31:47,742
[SPEAKER_11]: Did this guy just make a careless remark that got picked up and ran with by the gaming press and overanalyzed by folks like ourselves?

452
00:31:49,262 --> 00:31:50,443
[SPEAKER_01]: I kind of don't think so.

453
00:31:50,723 --> 00:31:52,263
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, who?

454
00:31:52,323 --> 00:31:52,743
[SPEAKER_01]: Kodak?

455
00:31:53,663 --> 00:31:55,124
[SPEAKER_01]: He made it to the Times.

456
00:31:56,404 --> 00:31:56,984
[SPEAKER_12]: I guess that's true.

457
00:31:57,004 --> 00:32:09,987
[SPEAKER_12]: I think he was pretty clear on it, but the fact is, I mean, how many times have we been reporting on, you know, company heads making stupid comments about something and, you know, and the fallout from it.

458
00:32:10,027 --> 00:32:17,049
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, Sony is a perfect example of that, you know, and thank goodness they got rid of the crayon-eating...

459
00:32:18,659 --> 00:32:19,503
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, it's...

460
00:32:22,335 --> 00:32:22,675
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know.

461
00:32:22,755 --> 00:32:26,118
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't think anything's really going to happen with this, and that's really kind of the issue.

462
00:32:26,218 --> 00:32:32,202
[SPEAKER_12]: And yes, I think that they should drop the price of their system, but for entirely different reasons other than Activision says so.

463
00:32:32,702 --> 00:32:35,624
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, that's not the reason to drop the price of the system.

464
00:32:35,724 --> 00:32:37,825
[SPEAKER_11]: There's some good debate going on in our chat room right now.

465
00:32:37,885 --> 00:32:40,347
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe that's why everybody's afraid to call in, which is fine.

466
00:32:40,487 --> 00:32:43,229
[SPEAKER_11]: And also, I think we had a slight listener dip tonight.

467
00:32:43,529 --> 00:32:46,731
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know if everybody's aware, but we shifted a little bit on the radio stream.

468
00:32:47,392 --> 00:32:50,254
[SPEAKER_11]: It is not right now on the front page of allgames.com.

469
00:32:50,274 --> 00:32:51,855
[SPEAKER_11]: I guess they're doing some remodeling over there.

470
00:32:51,895 --> 00:32:52,215
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

471
00:32:52,555 --> 00:32:53,096
[SPEAKER_11]: AllGamesRadio.com

472
00:33:12,211 --> 00:33:17,359
[SPEAKER_11]: But Ranma retorts with this, PS3 is not a premium console, neither is Xbox 360 or Wii.

473
00:33:17,739 --> 00:33:20,903
[SPEAKER_11]: Sony won't price drop because they'll take a higher loss on each unit.

474
00:33:21,324 --> 00:33:27,613
[SPEAKER_11]: Don't forget, Rob, Best Buy, GameStop, and other companies told Sony to drop the price of the PSP or else they'd stop selling it.

475
00:33:30,071 --> 00:33:53,560
[SPEAKER_12]: that is a problem when the companies that are selling your product are saying they're going to drop you I think more so than the publisher because to be honest they could probably make it through without Activision even though Activision right now is the number one publisher out there only because EA dropped the number two but I don't know it's not going to kill them if they go away

476
00:33:54,369 --> 00:33:56,971
[SPEAKER_11]: Let me read this comment as well from Bochikawa in our chatroom.

477
00:33:57,291 --> 00:34:01,414
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a total bluff, but it still puts into people's mindset to stop dealing with Sony.

478
00:34:01,534 --> 00:34:06,578
[SPEAKER_11]: And even then, I doubt they will stop dealings altogether, leaving ports or minor titles to them.

479
00:34:06,878 --> 00:34:07,738
[SPEAKER_12]: Because think about it.

480
00:34:08,019 --> 00:34:08,679
[SPEAKER_12]: Here's another thing.

481
00:34:08,779 --> 00:34:09,200
[SPEAKER_12]: Think about it.

482
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:12,742
[SPEAKER_12]: Would you really want to ruin your relationship with Sony?

483
00:34:13,382 --> 00:34:17,485
[SPEAKER_12]: Say, okay, we're going to stop supporting the PlayStation 3 and the PSP.

484
00:34:17,906 --> 00:34:19,287
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, the PlayStation 4 comes out.

485
00:34:19,947 --> 00:34:31,091
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, you just burned your bridges with Sony because you're being a dick, and now you have the PS4 coming out, and you could have had some really good partnerships with them to get some good launch titles and that kind of thing.

486
00:34:31,391 --> 00:34:41,535
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, but you were a dick, so now they're going to not, I don't know, maybe be so kind to you because you decided to drop them dead weight.

487
00:34:42,595 --> 00:34:44,956
[SPEAKER_12]: It may be possibly hurting the launch of your next system.

488
00:34:45,843 --> 00:34:50,305
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know how I feel about the whole PlayStation 3 is not a premium console content.

489
00:34:50,385 --> 00:34:53,626
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know if I necessarily call it premium, but let's face it.

490
00:34:53,726 --> 00:35:01,269
[SPEAKER_11]: The PlayStation 3 does have one big component you cannot ignore that the Xbox 360 and the Wii doesn't have, and that's Blu-ray.

491
00:35:01,369 --> 00:35:06,710
[SPEAKER_11]: Especially as we're getting into more high definition and Blu-rays are starting to penetrate the market more and more.

492
00:35:06,770 --> 00:35:08,071
[SPEAKER_11]: We're kind of where DVDs were.

493
00:35:08,451 --> 00:35:16,937
[SPEAKER_11]: What, 12 years ago, as Blu-rays are starting to penetrate the marketplace more and more, I don't think you can ignore the fact that the PlayStation 3 is the only one out there right now that's a Blu-ray player.

494
00:35:17,158 --> 00:35:26,284
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's not something that, despite all the rumors, Microsoft ain't even considering, and Nintendo sure as hell ain't considering this whole Blu-ray thing.

495
00:35:26,625 --> 00:35:29,387
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's one thing that Sony's always going to have, making it...

496
00:35:29,907 --> 00:35:31,608
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

497
00:35:54,822 --> 00:35:58,224
[SPEAKER_12]: And for the average consumer, the PS3 is an awesome Blu-ray player.

498
00:35:58,384 --> 00:36:00,085
[SPEAKER_12]: It does all the updating for them.

499
00:36:00,506 --> 00:36:04,588
[SPEAKER_12]: They don't need to worry about, oh, will this disc play in my system?

500
00:36:04,908 --> 00:36:11,072
[SPEAKER_12]: Because a lot of people out there that don't own a PS3 and just have a normal Blu-ray player, you need to have that thing connected to the internet.

501
00:36:11,312 --> 00:36:21,718
[SPEAKER_12]: And to update your system to the updated firmware so that it can play whatever Blu-ray movie is out there, there's a lot of...

502
00:36:22,438 --> 00:36:24,000
[SPEAKER_12]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

503
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:53,605
[SPEAKER_12]: But I've got to think, now that Blu-ray has been out there for at least a few years now, the price of the components have to have come down by now.

504
00:36:54,865 --> 00:36:56,486
[SPEAKER_12]: They've got to find ways to cut costs.

505
00:36:57,547 --> 00:37:01,109
[SPEAKER_12]: Maybe putting out new systems with larger hard drives isn't the way to go.

506
00:37:01,309 --> 00:37:05,331
[SPEAKER_12]: Maybe you should just keep the same hard drive size and start dropping the price.

507
00:37:05,992 --> 00:37:07,172
[SPEAKER_12]: Or drop something else.

508
00:37:07,232 --> 00:37:07,613
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know.

509
00:37:07,713 --> 00:37:08,333
[SPEAKER_12]: Make it cheaper.

510
00:37:10,649 --> 00:37:14,571
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, let's see, a couple more comments from chat.

511
00:37:14,851 --> 00:37:18,372
[SPEAKER_11]: Ranma says, Loki, that's reminiscent of the whole Nintendo Square debacle years ago.

512
00:37:19,993 --> 00:37:21,354
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and Square's back.

513
00:37:21,934 --> 00:37:26,896
[SPEAKER_11]: That's true, but Nintendo did take a pretty big hit.

514
00:37:28,457 --> 00:37:32,138
[SPEAKER_11]: Final Fantasy going over to the PlayStation was huge.

515
00:37:32,778 --> 00:37:34,119
[SPEAKER_11]: It was just absolutely huge.

516
00:37:34,959 --> 00:37:35,780
[SPEAKER_11]: In some ways...

517
00:37:36,843 --> 00:37:40,604
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe I'm just a little biased here because I happen to be a role-playing game fan.

518
00:37:41,164 --> 00:37:45,065
[SPEAKER_11]: I think Nintendo 64 didn't do so hot in part because of that.

519
00:37:45,225 --> 00:37:46,705
[SPEAKER_01]: Not really, but they did get Pokemon.

520
00:37:46,965 --> 00:37:48,646
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it was a Nintendo franchise.

521
00:37:49,326 --> 00:37:52,406
[SPEAKER_01]: But seriously, the Pokemon franchise... Oh, your sound is off.

522
00:37:52,446 --> 00:37:52,987
[SPEAKER_11]: Is your mic on?

523
00:37:53,587 --> 00:37:54,687
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it's... Sorry.

524
00:37:55,027 --> 00:38:00,768
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I was going to say, Nintendo did have Pokemon to keep them above water pretty much.

525
00:38:00,928 --> 00:38:04,129
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's what saved the Nintendo 64 as long as it did.

526
00:38:06,705 --> 00:38:07,066
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's see.

527
00:38:07,447 --> 00:38:10,916
[SPEAKER_11]: Two Africans in our chatroom says simply PlayStation 3 is a great system.

528
00:38:12,009 --> 00:38:12,669
[SPEAKER_11]: On what planet?

529
00:38:13,850 --> 00:38:14,170
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

530
00:38:14,210 --> 00:38:15,091
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it is a good system.

531
00:38:15,671 --> 00:38:16,311
[SPEAKER_11]: It is a good system.

532
00:38:16,331 --> 00:38:17,452
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a good Blu-ray player.

533
00:38:18,072 --> 00:38:19,633
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, yeah, it's a good Blu-ray player.

534
00:38:19,753 --> 00:38:21,654
[SPEAKER_11]: It's much quieter than the Xbox 360.

535
00:38:21,734 --> 00:38:22,935
[SPEAKER_11]: I enjoy playing games on it.

536
00:38:22,955 --> 00:38:25,236
[SPEAKER_11]: It's got the better controller than the 360.

537
00:38:25,416 --> 00:38:27,797
[SPEAKER_11]: I disagree.

538
00:38:27,817 --> 00:38:31,039
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't fault the PS3 as a bad system at all.

539
00:38:31,099 --> 00:38:32,279
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't think it is a bad system.

540
00:38:32,319 --> 00:38:33,740
[SPEAKER_12]: I think they just marketed it terribly.

541
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,041
[SPEAKER_12]: It was too expensive to begin with.

542
00:38:36,442 --> 00:38:38,963
[SPEAKER_12]: If I hadn't gotten mine for free from...

543
00:38:39,463 --> 00:38:40,243
[SPEAKER_12]: Let me go to the phones.

544
00:38:40,263 --> 00:38:41,464
[SPEAKER_12]: We just got a call.

545
00:38:41,484 --> 00:38:43,305
[SPEAKER_12]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

546
00:38:43,325 --> 00:38:43,805
[SPEAKER_12]: Who's this?

547
00:38:44,025 --> 00:38:44,346
[SPEAKER_12]: Hi, Spazinator.

548
00:38:44,386 --> 00:38:47,787
[SPEAKER_12]: What's on your mind about this whole PlayStation 3 debacle going on in Activision?

549
00:38:47,807 --> 00:38:50,249
[SPEAKER_12]: Do you think they're going to make good on the threat?

550
00:39:06,229 --> 00:39:07,169
[SPEAKER_00]: No, not at all.

551
00:39:07,690 --> 00:39:24,414
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there's a slight possibility, but the possibility of it's kind of, you know, there's always a possibility that, you know, it could snow in southern Mexico, but isn't very likely that it happens.

552
00:39:25,063 --> 00:39:26,985
[SPEAKER_00]: That's likely, but you never know.

553
00:39:28,026 --> 00:39:31,229
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, but I don't know if that's totally the same thing going on.

554
00:39:31,730 --> 00:39:38,617
[SPEAKER_11]: But what about, okay, like, I could ask the question, do you think Sony needs to drop the price of the console?

555
00:39:38,637 --> 00:39:40,299
[SPEAKER_11]: But who's not going to say yes to that?

556
00:39:41,260 --> 00:39:47,246
[SPEAKER_11]: But the question I'm going to ask is, do you think Sony has real legitimate reason to drop the price of their console right now?

557
00:39:49,363 --> 00:39:50,884
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, yes and no.

558
00:39:50,944 --> 00:39:52,585
[SPEAKER_00]: Depends on how you want to look at it.

559
00:39:52,945 --> 00:39:55,526
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm kind of on the fence on that subject.

560
00:39:57,007 --> 00:40:11,393
[SPEAKER_00]: On one hand, I can see why they're not pricing it, because, you know, mainly because of the Blu-ray drive itself, they're still kind of expensive to manufacture, and they're already taking a hit by, you know, selling at the price they're at.

561
00:40:12,202 --> 00:40:38,945
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the same time, at least for most consoles, I think, except for the Wii and the PlayStation 2, generally speaking, console manufacturers always take a hit on consoles, and it's kind of like a stop-loss kind of thing, where they tend to make all their money through the licensing fees on the games, right?

562
00:40:39,756 --> 00:40:41,077
[SPEAKER_11]: They just don't... They don't...

563
00:41:05,578 --> 00:41:05,618
[SPEAKER_12]: Um...

564
00:41:28,274 --> 00:41:36,143
[SPEAKER_00]: probably not, I hope not, at least for the sake of all those that only own the PlayStation 3, although they're going to have to

565
00:41:36,565 --> 00:41:39,607
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't remember if Spassinator is the one that plays Final Fantasy XI.

566
00:41:39,628 --> 00:41:42,670
[SPEAKER_00]: It was him or one of the other listeners that plays Final Fantasy XI a lot.

567
00:41:42,790 --> 00:41:45,652
[SPEAKER_11]: That made me think that Final Fantasy XIV is on its way to PlayStation 3.

568
00:41:45,692 --> 00:41:45,972
[SPEAKER_11]: God, I know.

569
00:42:06,369 --> 00:42:13,016
[SPEAKER_11]: There are some exclusives out there on the horizon, but is it going to be... Here's the thing with Sony.

570
00:42:13,376 --> 00:42:16,680
[SPEAKER_12]: It's been this way ever since the launch of the PS3 and even the PSP.

571
00:42:17,250 --> 00:42:18,591
[SPEAKER_12]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

572
00:42:38,268 --> 00:42:43,593
[SPEAKER_12]: And even with like the PSP, the PSP Go price, are they fucking crazy?

573
00:42:43,954 --> 00:42:45,435
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's put it out for $250.

574
00:42:45,555 --> 00:42:47,877
[SPEAKER_12]: Great, that's a perfect way not to sell any more consoles.

575
00:42:48,098 --> 00:42:50,180
[SPEAKER_12]: That PSP Go is going to fail like crazy.

576
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:52,202
[SPEAKER_12]: But I don't know.

577
00:42:52,302 --> 00:42:59,028
[SPEAKER_12]: I think it's just they're really, they need to get smart and they need to figure out a way to gain ground now.

578
00:42:59,208 --> 00:43:02,772
[SPEAKER_12]: And yes, exclusives will help, but price drop will help even more.

579
00:43:03,206 --> 00:43:11,273
[SPEAKER_01]: If the PSP Go, I think, had a $99 price point on it like Dan had mentioned a while back, then I think they'd be selling like freaking hotcakes.

580
00:43:12,099 --> 00:43:12,419
[SPEAKER_10]: I agree.

581
00:43:12,820 --> 00:43:30,437
[SPEAKER_01]: And on top of that, looking at the construction of them, about what they took out, the machines themselves can't really be relatively that expensive to produce, nor can shipping and marketing costs really be that much if they've already got some momentum going with it.

582
00:43:31,077 --> 00:43:32,599
[SPEAKER_01]: So really, say that...

583
00:43:35,201 --> 00:43:41,167
[SPEAKER_01]: To cost ship and market each individual system, it costs them, say, 80 bucks.

584
00:43:41,808 --> 00:43:44,430
[SPEAKER_01]: Put it out for 125, you'll make tons of profit still.

585
00:43:44,971 --> 00:43:49,936
[SPEAKER_01]: Because you'll get more units out, and the more you mass produce them, the cheaper they are to produce.

586
00:43:50,516 --> 00:43:59,860
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got to move on with some more stories, and we will, but I want to say... My point is, that's simple economics, simple business, and Sony should know that.

587
00:44:00,561 --> 00:44:07,644
[SPEAKER_01]: If they want to get the games, if they want to keep some of their people, if they want to sell the systems, that's the way to do it.

588
00:44:09,091 --> 00:44:17,535
[SPEAKER_11]: I think one place that Sony is losing to Microsoft, as much as I do enjoy my PlayStation 3, is that they are not staying current as fast as Microsoft does.

589
00:44:17,975 --> 00:44:20,096
[SPEAKER_11]: And that is killing them this generation.

590
00:44:20,516 --> 00:44:27,540
[SPEAKER_11]: Because Microsoft had a hard time doing that with the original Xbox, but right now they built that 360 to get these upgrades and all these things.

591
00:44:28,140 --> 00:44:29,620
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

592
00:44:57,327 --> 00:44:59,148
[SPEAKER_11]: to the PlayStation outside of home.

593
00:45:01,249 --> 00:45:04,131
[SPEAKER_11]: And some would argue home was not all it was cracked up to be.

594
00:45:04,651 --> 00:45:07,813
[SPEAKER_12]: It's definitely not the big hub that they thought it would be.

595
00:45:07,973 --> 00:45:10,955
[SPEAKER_12]: It's kind of a neat thing to play around with, but yeah.

596
00:45:11,556 --> 00:45:14,719
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, well, I'm sure this story is to be continued.

597
00:45:14,779 --> 00:45:20,383
[SPEAKER_11]: It'll be interesting to see how long this whole little stalemate lasts.

598
00:45:20,984 --> 00:45:28,029
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, speaking of PlayStation, the PSP Go has an interesting rumor kind of related to it.

599
00:45:28,490 --> 00:45:38,558
[SPEAKER_12]: Apparently, there's a rumor that Sony is working on an app store for the PSP Go, and that's going to be revealed at Gamescom in Cologne this August.

600
00:45:39,578 --> 00:45:50,726
[SPEAKER_12]: and they're basically saying that these games will be limited to like 100 megs and basically that's only the limit for the content.

601
00:45:51,266 --> 00:45:58,411
[SPEAKER_12]: But any apps that they want to create including non-game applications may also be available as well.

602
00:45:59,031 --> 00:46:08,778
[SPEAKER_12]: So some of these smaller programs at cheaper prices or maybe free kind of aligning themselves with what Apple has with their app store.

603
00:46:09,458 --> 00:46:12,401
[SPEAKER_12]: It'd be interesting if this is going to be the draw for the PSP Go.

604
00:46:15,664 --> 00:46:31,537
[SPEAKER_12]: It makes sense to me that they're going to do something like this, because really, this has to be the only thing that they've got in the cards for, because what would be the draw to the PSP Go if basically all the games are just digital downloads now?

605
00:46:32,631 --> 00:46:33,852
[SPEAKER_12]: and the system's more expensive.

606
00:46:34,192 --> 00:46:37,495
[SPEAKER_12]: You need something unique to it to draw people to pay that extra $100.

607
00:46:38,916 --> 00:46:41,719
[SPEAKER_11]: I kind of thought this already existed.

608
00:46:41,859 --> 00:46:51,888
[SPEAKER_11]: Not so much a storefront on the PSP, but I thought your PS3 store was supposed to interact with the PSP as well as you could get something like this on your PC.

609
00:46:52,528 --> 00:46:53,629
[SPEAKER_12]: It's not necessarily...

610
00:46:55,748 --> 00:46:56,209
[SPEAKER_12]: Thanks for watching!

611
00:47:16,852 --> 00:47:17,793
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, it's an iPhone store.

612
00:47:17,813 --> 00:47:20,076
[SPEAKER_11]: Are they going to sell music and movies on it, too?

613
00:47:21,177 --> 00:47:24,941
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, they already do on the PlayStation Network, so... I guess that's true.

614
00:47:25,842 --> 00:47:30,047
[SPEAKER_11]: You can get it on your PSP, but I would bet you they ain't doing half the business Apple is.

615
00:47:30,547 --> 00:47:30,767
[SPEAKER_02]: Nope.

616
00:47:31,417 --> 00:47:32,278
[SPEAKER_12]: Thanks for watching!

617
00:47:51,211 --> 00:47:52,232
[SPEAKER_11]: and they're like, whatever.

618
00:47:52,252 --> 00:47:55,936
[SPEAKER_11]: I have a cell phone contract with my company right now or whatever.

619
00:47:56,376 --> 00:48:01,401
[SPEAKER_11]: It's kind of an inevitable part about doing business with a phone company in this day and age which is too bad in some ways.

620
00:48:03,083 --> 00:48:06,486
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm probably not going to do my upgrade though for some time.

621
00:48:07,193 --> 00:48:09,035
[SPEAKER_11]: No, I mean, I'm already an iPhone user.

622
00:48:09,135 --> 00:48:11,337
[SPEAKER_11]: The 3GS does not seem to have enough.

623
00:48:12,458 --> 00:48:18,964
[SPEAKER_11]: Especially, I would have to pay extra money because I'm not eligible for upgrade yet, which is AT&T's problem.

624
00:48:19,324 --> 00:48:20,085
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, no.

625
00:48:20,926 --> 00:48:24,029
[SPEAKER_01]: They took away that thing where...

626
00:48:24,600 --> 00:48:26,821
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, you still have to be in a certain window, though, that I'm not in.

627
00:48:27,842 --> 00:48:29,023
[SPEAKER_01]: But I've got an old iPhone.

628
00:48:30,063 --> 00:48:38,328
[SPEAKER_01]: So for me, it makes perfect sense to upgrade it, although I'm not going to do it until about a month from now, but still.

629
00:48:38,889 --> 00:48:40,109
[SPEAKER_01]: Wait for them to work all the bugs out of it.

630
00:48:40,250 --> 00:48:42,851
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, if you're still on the very, very old one, I can see why.

631
00:48:42,891 --> 00:48:47,974
[SPEAKER_11]: But I'm on a 3G, and there's just not enough about 3GS that really... Yeah, battery life, yes.

632
00:48:48,014 --> 00:48:51,576
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm down for the faster processor myself and having a better camera on it.

633
00:48:53,318 --> 00:48:53,878
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, um...

634
00:48:55,242 --> 00:48:55,642
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's see.

635
00:48:56,924 --> 00:48:59,907
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I don't know about this whole PSP store thing.

636
00:48:59,947 --> 00:49:04,211
[SPEAKER_11]: I guess it's a good idea, but I kind of think it's like kind of in a way it's too late.

637
00:49:04,331 --> 00:49:06,953
[SPEAKER_11]: But I guess there's a lot of people that don't have nor want the iPhone.

638
00:49:07,314 --> 00:49:14,901
[SPEAKER_11]: And again, I have to think about that college kid audience that seems to be the PSP target audience that really has these things.

639
00:49:14,921 --> 00:49:17,303
[SPEAKER_12]: Here's the other thing too, the college kid audience.

640
00:49:18,064 --> 00:49:25,126
[SPEAKER_12]: If you really want to, you can mod your PSP and there's the homebrew community that's already done this and has been doing this for years now.

641
00:49:25,246 --> 00:49:30,228
[SPEAKER_12]: So why bother paying for something that you can get for free and it'll probably end up being better anyways.

642
00:49:31,188 --> 00:49:38,391
[SPEAKER_12]: And seriously, if the PSP Go does take off, then those PSP 2000s and 3000s are going to be even cheaper.

643
00:49:38,751 --> 00:49:41,112
[SPEAKER_12]: You might as well do the 2000 because the screen isn't...

644
00:49:42,059 --> 00:49:42,780
[SPEAKER_12]: Space Invaders Extreme

645
00:49:59,787 --> 00:50:02,129
[SPEAKER_11]: Honestly, at this point, probably not.

646
00:50:02,269 --> 00:50:04,751
[SPEAKER_11]: But that's because I'm not a fan of handheld gaming in the first place.

647
00:50:04,771 --> 00:50:11,555
[SPEAKER_11]: And I've gone into this rant on a previous show, and I realize this is a personal preference that makes me weird than a lot of other gamers.

648
00:50:12,036 --> 00:50:13,637
[SPEAKER_11]: I do not like playing portable games.

649
00:50:13,977 --> 00:50:22,523
[SPEAKER_11]: The only place I can play a portable game is at the airport, on an airplane, when I'm on a trip and don't have my consoles with me, and I have to play something.

650
00:50:22,803 --> 00:50:23,624
[SPEAKER_11]: But if I'm at home...

651
00:50:24,344 --> 00:50:42,885
[SPEAKER_01]: I would not be caught dead with the DS in my own home playing in my house when I have a Playstation and all this other stuff readily available to play well if I want to play a particular game if I've got the system for it I'll just play it on whatever system it's on if I want to play Cooking Mama I'll play the good version on the DS which I've been known to do

652
00:50:44,356 --> 00:51:04,942
[SPEAKER_11]: for me to go that far there's so many games out there it's kind of like there's lots of games I want to play and I'll just play the ones I want to play on the console while I'm at home and again I know I'm weird but a game on the handhelds has to be really good and really anticipated for me to play them when I'm in house Scribblenuts

653
00:51:07,352 --> 00:51:12,659
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll probably end up picking it up for when I do travel, but I don't see myself sitting in my bed playing it.

654
00:51:12,759 --> 00:51:13,741
[SPEAKER_11]: I know I'm weird like that.

655
00:51:13,841 --> 00:51:14,181
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

656
00:51:14,322 --> 00:51:15,003
[SPEAKER_11]: I can't explain it.

657
00:51:16,284 --> 00:51:17,346
[SPEAKER_11]: Do you play games on your iPhone?

658
00:51:18,648 --> 00:51:18,808
[SPEAKER_11]: Um...

659
00:51:20,100 --> 00:51:20,400
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura.com

660
00:51:38,231 --> 00:51:39,052
[SPEAKER_01]: There's all the time, though.

661
00:51:39,072 --> 00:51:49,285
[SPEAKER_01]: I sit here when I'm chatting with people online, and I'm playing Vi right now, which was an old NES RPG that they put out on my phone.

662
00:51:49,305 --> 00:51:50,026
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been playing that.

663
00:51:51,848 --> 00:51:52,369
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, so anyhow.

664
00:51:53,147 --> 00:51:53,747
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I know.

665
00:51:54,107 --> 00:51:56,488
[SPEAKER_11]: I know I'm weird about the whole handheld thing, but sorry.

666
00:51:56,528 --> 00:51:58,769
[SPEAKER_11]: I got off the original topic about the PSP App Store.

667
00:51:59,169 --> 00:52:00,549
[SPEAKER_11]: I guess it's an inevitable thing.

668
00:52:00,829 --> 00:52:04,070
[SPEAKER_11]: How successful it'll be, I guess it all depends what apps are on it.

669
00:52:04,210 --> 00:52:08,112
[SPEAKER_11]: If it has the must-have apps, but I don't see a lot of people just downloading it for the calculator.

670
00:52:08,132 --> 00:52:08,792
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's just put it this way.

671
00:52:08,832 --> 00:52:12,253
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's look at what other people have done, like the DSi Store.

672
00:52:12,533 --> 00:52:13,313
[SPEAKER_12]: Their apps suck.

673
00:52:13,773 --> 00:52:14,013
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

674
00:52:14,274 --> 00:52:14,974
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's go to the phones.

675
00:52:15,014 --> 00:52:15,954
[SPEAKER_11]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

676
00:52:15,994 --> 00:52:16,354
[SPEAKER_11]: Who's this?

677
00:52:17,495 --> 00:52:18,255
[SPEAKER_11]: Hey, what's up, everybody?

678
00:52:18,275 --> 00:52:18,995
[SPEAKER_11]: This is Kajudo.

679
00:52:19,455 --> 00:52:20,736
[SPEAKER_11]: Hey, Kajudo.

680
00:52:20,756 --> 00:52:20,816
[SPEAKER_11]: Hey.

681
00:52:22,700 --> 00:52:23,660
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

682
00:52:24,261 --> 00:52:25,901
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, hey, welcome to the show.

683
00:52:25,961 --> 00:52:32,284
[SPEAKER_11]: What do you think about this whole PSP store and the PSP competing with the iPhone in a way?

684
00:52:33,484 --> 00:52:37,746
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I don't own any of the PSPs just because it just never appealed to me.

685
00:52:37,806 --> 00:52:41,048
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm more of a DS fan where I like the innovation.

686
00:52:41,748 --> 00:52:44,409
[SPEAKER_06]: They just seem to build games for that system.

687
00:52:44,449 --> 00:52:49,351
[SPEAKER_06]: The PSP to me just seems like, okay, you want to take your PS3 or your PlayStation 2 in the car.

688
00:52:49,946 --> 00:52:50,566
[SPEAKER_06]: You can have that.

689
00:52:50,926 --> 00:52:54,807
[SPEAKER_06]: And really, I'm not interested in playing those types of games in my car.

690
00:52:55,147 --> 00:52:55,407
[SPEAKER_06]: You know?

691
00:52:55,747 --> 00:52:58,128
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd rather just a little simple point-and-click type game.

692
00:52:58,368 --> 00:53:01,809
[SPEAKER_06]: But what I'm concerned about is this, uh, what is it?

693
00:53:02,489 --> 00:53:03,369
[SPEAKER_06]: The PSP Go?

694
00:53:04,989 --> 00:53:05,749
[SPEAKER_06]: Mm-hmm, PSP Go.

695
00:53:05,769 --> 00:53:13,291
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, what happens if I install these games on the PSP Go and I get my PSP stolen or I lose it?

696
00:53:13,351 --> 00:53:17,172
[SPEAKER_06]: That's like all my games are just basically down the drain now, right?

697
00:53:18,050 --> 00:53:24,535
[SPEAKER_12]: They're tied to your PlayStation Network accounts just like if your PS3 got stolen or exploded or something.

698
00:53:25,516 --> 00:53:26,577
[SPEAKER_12]: So you can re-download them again.

699
00:53:28,058 --> 00:53:28,339
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, okay.

700
00:53:28,379 --> 00:53:29,139
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't know that.

701
00:53:29,219 --> 00:53:35,425
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought it was something where you buy it off of their online store and it's saved on there and if you lose it then that's just...

702
00:53:36,024 --> 00:53:36,444
[SPEAKER_06]: No problem.

703
00:53:36,785 --> 00:53:41,229
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, that's certainly a valid concern, especially when you go to this whole digital distribution.

704
00:53:41,269 --> 00:53:45,834
[SPEAKER_11]: But yeah, I know on PlayStation Network, I mean, I don't buy anything for the PSP.

705
00:53:45,914 --> 00:53:48,597
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, it's the same deal.

706
00:53:48,737 --> 00:53:52,020
[SPEAKER_11]: Once you buy something, it's yours and you can re-download it later if you need to.

707
00:53:52,581 --> 00:53:58,827
[SPEAKER_11]: But isn't there like a thing like there's got to be a way to prevent me from going to a friend's house and downloading the game and they play it?

708
00:53:59,247 --> 00:54:02,830
[SPEAKER_12]: What if that service, for some reason, one day they no longer provide that download?

709
00:54:02,850 --> 00:54:06,633
[SPEAKER_12]: That's always another concern with me with things like, what is it, Valve?

710
00:54:06,853 --> 00:54:07,693
[SPEAKER_12]: Steam, Steam.

711
00:54:07,753 --> 00:54:08,854
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm a little concerned with that, like,

712
00:54:23,584 --> 00:54:25,484
[SPEAKER_06]: What happens if one day Steam just goes away?

713
00:54:25,504 --> 00:54:26,905
[SPEAKER_06]: Where does my games go?

714
00:54:27,185 --> 00:54:31,226
[SPEAKER_12]: Then they go into oblivion, unfortunately, unless you have them downloaded to your system.

715
00:54:31,566 --> 00:54:42,768
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I would think, I would hope the respectable thing to do would be to release, if your company's about to go under, release something that's going to require, not require Steam anymore for that.

716
00:54:42,988 --> 00:54:51,830
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, that or the other option, too, if you know that they're going to, you know, granted, I don't think the Sony store is just going to up and die all of a sudden, but, I mean, if you...

717
00:54:52,745 --> 00:54:53,886
[SPEAKER_12]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

718
00:55:12,402 --> 00:55:36,517
[SPEAKER_11]: Bobby Blackwolf in chat would like to clarify Steam has a failsafe for that reason they've already stated that if they go under they will remove the digital rights management so it's kind of like I speculated that they would do the right thing and just disable the necessity of having Steam in the first place well hey thank you so much for the call and we appreciate it I just have one game recommendation for Loki you must get Red Faction Guerrilla I have it I just haven't played it yet

719
00:55:37,403 --> 00:55:37,823
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura.com

720
00:55:56,531 --> 00:55:58,373
[SPEAKER_12]: I was like, oh yeah, I really gotta play that game.

721
00:55:58,433 --> 00:56:00,595
[SPEAKER_12]: And I also have Prototype 2, so I have to go back to that.

722
00:56:00,615 --> 00:56:02,616
[SPEAKER_12]: And Fuel, I have to go play that.

723
00:56:02,676 --> 00:56:06,219
[SPEAKER_12]: So there's a lot of stuff, and I just got my... I'm trying to unpack right now.

724
00:56:06,239 --> 00:56:07,540
[SPEAKER_11]: Now is just not a good time to move.

725
00:56:07,881 --> 00:56:08,681
[SPEAKER_12]: It's not.

726
00:56:08,741 --> 00:56:09,582
[SPEAKER_12]: I have to unpack.

727
00:56:10,743 --> 00:56:13,085
[SPEAKER_12]: The summer's dead for me as far as what's coming out.

728
00:56:13,205 --> 00:56:16,888
[SPEAKER_12]: So it's a good time to get all these games now, because then I can play them through the summer.

729
00:56:17,909 --> 00:56:19,150
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, well thank you so much for the call.

730
00:56:19,170 --> 00:56:19,551
[SPEAKER_11]: Enjoy the show.

731
00:56:19,591 --> 00:56:19,971
[SPEAKER_11]: Good night, guys.

732
00:56:19,991 --> 00:56:20,732
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, take care, buddy.

733
00:56:21,681 --> 00:56:21,921
[SPEAKER_11]: 1-877-GAME-OLR

734
00:56:43,760 --> 00:56:49,163
[SPEAKER_12]: I thought that the rumor was actually that it was going to be treated like a console launch and people thought that it was going to be a new console.

735
00:56:49,183 --> 00:56:50,203
[SPEAKER_11]: That's what I thought too.

736
00:56:50,604 --> 00:57:01,229
[SPEAKER_11]: But also the fact that it was going to be not so much like a new console console, but you know how PlayStation 1 and then there's PlayStation 1 Slim a couple years later.

737
00:57:01,589 --> 00:57:03,530
[SPEAKER_11]: I think the thought was there was going to be an Xbox 360 Slim.

738
00:57:05,311 --> 00:57:20,636
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, the CEO of Microsoft, Steve Ballmer, actually came out and said that... Well, I'm sorry, that actually, he was the guy that made that first remark about the whole Xbox 360 hardware integration that caused everybody to run with everything going on here.

739
00:57:22,409 --> 00:57:32,113
[SPEAKER_11]: The director of product management for Xbox 360 and Xbox Live, Aaron Greenberg, actually straight up told Kotaku earlier this week, there will be no console.

740
00:57:32,453 --> 00:57:34,774
[SPEAKER_11]: We're not going to be launching a new console anytime soon.

741
00:57:35,094 --> 00:57:37,415
[SPEAKER_11]: I really believe he was speaking about Project Natal.

742
00:57:37,855 --> 00:57:42,917
[SPEAKER_11]: We want to make sure people know that we're excited about Project Natal, but we're barely halfway through this generation.

743
00:57:43,177 --> 00:57:46,558
[SPEAKER_11]: We're happy with the Xbox 360, so there are no changes from that standpoint.

744
00:57:46,819 --> 00:57:50,420
[SPEAKER_11]: For the time being, we're really just showing a whole new category of gaming.

745
00:57:51,489 --> 00:57:57,716
[SPEAKER_11]: And then they're talking about, are they thinking about doing the hands-free stuff in a new Xbox 360 configuration?

746
00:57:58,077 --> 00:58:03,323
[SPEAKER_11]: They did say, yes, we have looked at that, but we haven't announced any details for something like that.

747
00:58:03,343 --> 00:58:06,726
[SPEAKER_12]: I think they're just really kind of lying by omission, basically.

748
00:58:07,427 --> 00:58:08,729
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that's exactly what they're doing.

749
00:58:08,909 --> 00:58:10,511
[SPEAKER_11]: I think there is.

750
00:58:11,572 --> 00:58:12,012
[SPEAKER_11]: In a way...

751
00:58:13,893 --> 00:58:16,714
[SPEAKER_11]: Here's the most important quotes from this.

752
00:58:17,235 --> 00:58:22,878
[SPEAKER_11]: We are saying that the Natal will run on the Xbox 360, so there's no new hardware to purchase.

753
00:58:23,539 --> 00:58:36,247
[SPEAKER_11]: What we're doing that's unique is instead of asking you to invest in a new generation of hardware, a generation that's already well established, extending the experience even longer by adding this whole new category of experiences with Project Natal.

754
00:58:36,647 --> 00:58:39,969
[SPEAKER_11]: We're changing the rules just a little bit like we did with the new Xbox experiences.

755
00:58:40,109 --> 00:58:42,832
[SPEAKER_12]: It's just going to be, they're going to do a new console.

756
00:58:42,892 --> 00:58:49,197
[SPEAKER_12]: It may be slimmed down, it may not be slimmed down, but it's going to be some sort of a new revision and it's going to have Natal with it.

757
00:58:49,238 --> 00:58:50,439
[SPEAKER_12]: And that's basically it.

758
00:58:50,579 --> 00:58:56,364
[SPEAKER_12]: It may be integrated into it if they decide to actually slim down the form factor of it, but there will be a new console.

759
00:58:56,524 --> 00:59:02,690
[SPEAKER_12]: There will not be a new console because it's not going to be the Xbox, you know, the next one, the 720 or whatever you want to call it.

760
00:59:03,311 --> 00:59:12,707
[SPEAKER_12]: It won't be a new console in that sense, but just like how the PlayStation 2, spelled out T-W-O, is not a new console, it's just a slimmer console.

761
00:59:12,867 --> 00:59:14,871
[SPEAKER_12]: It's the same console, but just...

762
00:59:15,785 --> 00:59:17,587
[SPEAKER_11]: You've noticed the way he's wording it.

763
00:59:17,647 --> 00:59:18,788
[SPEAKER_11]: He's not saying no.

764
00:59:19,328 --> 00:59:20,309
[SPEAKER_11]: He's not saying no.

765
00:59:20,689 --> 00:59:25,693
[SPEAKER_11]: He's reassuring people that they're not going to have to buy a new console to enjoy Project Natal.

766
00:59:26,174 --> 00:59:29,497
[SPEAKER_11]: He didn't come out and say, we're not releasing a new set of hardware.

767
00:59:29,817 --> 00:59:30,838
[SPEAKER_11]: He didn't really say that.

768
00:59:31,178 --> 00:59:34,361
[SPEAKER_11]: He said, don't worry, Project Natal will work on your existing hardware.

769
00:59:34,621 --> 00:59:35,402
[SPEAKER_11]: That's what I'm hearing.

770
00:59:36,351 --> 00:59:39,732
[SPEAKER_11]: He's reassuring people that they don't need to do this hardware upgrade.

771
00:59:40,052 --> 00:59:45,014
[SPEAKER_11]: But I still think there's going to be... There has to be some perks to doing an upgrade.

772
00:59:45,514 --> 00:59:48,175
[SPEAKER_11]: I think there will be at least a bundle that comes with Natal.

773
00:59:48,195 --> 00:59:49,595
[SPEAKER_11]: I think they're really going to push this thing.

774
00:59:49,635 --> 00:59:50,336
[SPEAKER_11]: Why shouldn't they?

775
00:59:51,236 --> 00:59:52,997
[SPEAKER_11]: It is their answer to the Wii after all.

776
00:59:53,217 --> 00:59:58,078
[SPEAKER_12]: It's going to be kind of... They're going to treat it like a new launch, so why not relaunch the system?

777
00:59:58,098 --> 00:59:59,479
[SPEAKER_12]: See, because that's what they're going to do.

778
00:59:59,499 --> 01:00:01,379
[SPEAKER_12]: They're even going to probably phrase it like that.

779
01:00:01,399 --> 01:00:01,820
[SPEAKER_12]: This is...

780
01:00:03,188 --> 01:00:04,088
[SPEAKER_12]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

781
01:00:26,653 --> 01:00:29,776
[SPEAKER_11]: But in reality, they did go back and pump up the hardware a little bit.

782
01:00:30,336 --> 01:00:36,742
[SPEAKER_11]: Because remember, you couldn't really have NXE on your system if you didn't have a hard drive or a memory card or something.

783
01:00:37,083 --> 01:00:40,145
[SPEAKER_11]: If you had no memory, you can't even store NXE.

784
01:00:40,566 --> 01:00:51,896
[SPEAKER_11]: But now there's hardware out there that they've doubled the memory that it's now 512 megs built in that can fit NXE and probably some of the other stuff on your actual physical drive.

785
01:00:52,677 --> 01:00:52,917
[SPEAKER_11]: So...

786
01:00:54,420 --> 01:00:55,902
[SPEAKER_11]: And they've gotten rid of their arcade games.

787
01:00:56,062 --> 01:00:58,305
[SPEAKER_11]: This kind of confl... Well, that's true too.

788
01:00:58,585 --> 01:01:01,128
[SPEAKER_11]: But this kind of conflicts with what he's saying.

789
01:01:01,268 --> 01:01:02,410
[SPEAKER_11]: I knew this was coming a long time.

790
01:01:03,231 --> 01:01:03,791
[SPEAKER_11]: Actually, it's funny.

791
01:01:03,871 --> 01:01:05,293
[SPEAKER_11]: I remember you saying something on the show.

792
01:01:05,313 --> 01:01:05,914
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, I did.

793
01:01:06,254 --> 01:01:08,717
[SPEAKER_12]: And they were slowly transitioning.

794
01:01:08,797 --> 01:01:13,643
[SPEAKER_12]: It was the console that they had the holiday bundles that they can do with the games packed in.

795
01:01:13,903 --> 01:01:14,443
[SPEAKER_12]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

796
01:01:38,904 --> 01:01:47,426
[SPEAKER_12]: I hope that they do make a slimmer one.

797
01:01:48,387 --> 01:01:53,528
[SPEAKER_11]: I could be talked into upgrading my system, actually, because I still have my old-ass Xbox 360.

798
01:01:53,968 --> 01:02:01,890
[SPEAKER_11]: I could be talked into it for HDMI, quieter system, and maybe any other perks they're going to throw at me with new hardware.

799
01:02:02,150 --> 01:02:12,334
[SPEAKER_12]: It would be quieter because of the smaller chipsets, less heat, less need for a huge fan.

800
01:02:12,554 --> 01:02:13,394
[SPEAKER_11]: But here's my concern.

801
01:02:13,434 --> 01:02:15,035
[SPEAKER_11]: My old hard drive's not going to work with it.

802
01:02:15,435 --> 01:02:18,296
[SPEAKER_11]: Because if they slim down the system, that massive drive's not going to fit on it.

803
01:02:18,696 --> 01:02:19,237
[SPEAKER_11]: No, they could.

804
01:02:19,777 --> 01:02:23,058
[SPEAKER_12]: It'd be the same thickness, or maybe a plug-in to the top.

805
01:02:23,518 --> 01:02:23,978
[SPEAKER_12]: They could do it.

806
01:02:24,479 --> 01:02:24,839
[SPEAKER_11]: Interesting.

807
01:02:24,959 --> 01:02:25,479
[SPEAKER_11]: I hope they do.

808
01:02:25,719 --> 01:02:26,139
[SPEAKER_11]: I hope they do.

809
01:02:26,199 --> 01:02:29,300
[SPEAKER_11]: Because I wouldn't want to have to get a new drive and all that stuff again.

810
01:02:29,360 --> 01:02:30,121
[SPEAKER_11]: That would turn me off.

811
01:02:30,421 --> 01:02:30,781
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll see.

812
01:02:32,927 --> 01:02:33,849
[SPEAKER_12]: I would think that they would.

813
01:02:33,869 --> 01:02:36,775
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, look at the PlayStation Slim.

814
01:02:36,855 --> 01:02:39,100
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, all the peripherals, for the most part, work with it.

815
01:02:39,160 --> 01:02:41,745
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, there's obviously... The multi-tap doesn't, but...

816
01:02:45,234 --> 01:02:49,715
[SPEAKER_12]: Other interesting things, going back to talking about Activision again.

817
01:02:50,855 --> 01:02:59,397
[SPEAKER_12]: Activision, I guess the prices for their new peripheral games are actually starting to come out online.

818
01:03:00,597 --> 01:03:05,518
[SPEAKER_12]: Retailers like Amazon and GameStop and stuff like that are starting to take pre-orders on them.

819
01:03:05,578 --> 01:03:07,779
[SPEAKER_12]: People are kind of shocked at how expensive they are.

820
01:03:08,399 --> 01:03:08,579
[SPEAKER_12]: Now,

821
01:03:09,451 --> 01:03:10,956
[SPEAKER_12]: This is Activision we're talking about here.

822
01:03:11,116 --> 01:03:12,781
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm not shocked at how expensive they are.

823
01:03:13,002 --> 01:03:14,928
[SPEAKER_12]: But it is interesting, though.

824
01:03:15,088 --> 01:03:15,971
[SPEAKER_12]: Like, for example...

825
01:03:17,918 --> 01:03:41,567
[SPEAKER_12]: DJ Hero I think we talked about this a little bit before it's going to retail for $120 and it's of course bundled in with the DJ controller which when you look at like previously releases like say Guitar Hero with a guitar bundled with it that's typically been $99.99 for an Xbox 360 or Playstation 3 version the Playstation 2 version though is coming out at $99.99 so there is like a $30 premium on all these different

826
01:03:46,909 --> 01:03:47,950
[SPEAKER_12]: BAND HERO

827
01:04:08,562 --> 01:04:09,463
[SPEAKER_12]: Guitar Hero Game

828
01:04:22,520 --> 01:04:24,001
[SPEAKER_12]: DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

829
01:04:40,748 --> 01:04:41,368
[SPEAKER_12]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

830
01:05:06,960 --> 01:05:08,741
[SPEAKER_12]: So maybe they think they're justified in that sense.

831
01:05:09,561 --> 01:05:11,983
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, well, what's Band Hero bringing new to the table?

832
01:05:12,303 --> 01:05:14,624
[SPEAKER_11]: I can tell you what Beatles rock band is bringing new to the table.

833
01:05:15,305 --> 01:05:17,306
[SPEAKER_11]: But what is... Well, I don't know.

834
01:05:17,346 --> 01:05:18,887
[SPEAKER_11]: Some folks might want to argue with me on that.

835
01:05:18,927 --> 01:05:29,933
[SPEAKER_11]: But at the same time, I'm telling you, put the Beatles rock band gameplay next to Guitar Hero Van Halen gameplay, and I'll tell you what justifies that premium Beatles prize.

836
01:05:29,953 --> 01:05:30,693
[SPEAKER_12]: You know what I mean?

837
01:05:30,913 --> 01:05:32,754
[SPEAKER_12]: Here's something funny, though, if you think about it.

838
01:05:32,975 --> 01:05:33,195
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay?

839
01:05:34,298 --> 01:05:39,402
[SPEAKER_12]: Guitar Hero World Tour right now I think is like $180 if I remember correctly.

840
01:05:39,422 --> 01:05:40,683
[SPEAKER_12]: I think it's like $179.99.

841
01:05:41,163 --> 01:05:43,665
[SPEAKER_12]: In fact, I'm going to look that up right now.

842
01:05:44,265 --> 01:05:52,871
[SPEAKER_12]: But let's just assume with Guitar Hero 5 coming out, you've got to think that they're probably going to do a price drop on Guitar Hero World Tour.

843
01:05:53,372 --> 01:05:57,595
[SPEAKER_12]: Because they've got to clear out the extra units that they have and maybe they're not going to do it right away.

844
01:05:57,635 --> 01:05:57,755
[SPEAKER_12]: But

845
01:05:58,275 --> 01:06:00,736
[SPEAKER_12]: You would think that they were going to drop it because that's what they normally do.

846
01:06:00,776 --> 01:06:05,839
[SPEAKER_12]: They drop the version that came out last year in preparation for the new one.

847
01:06:06,299 --> 01:06:10,261
[SPEAKER_12]: So you've got the bundles that are available out there right now for World Tour.

848
01:06:10,701 --> 01:06:15,603
[SPEAKER_12]: And say that you can get them for, I don't know, $150, $149.99.

849
01:06:16,564 --> 01:06:18,825
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm sure that's not too much of a stretch.

850
01:06:20,345 --> 01:06:25,308
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, so now you have this new game coming out for $200 worldwide.

851
01:06:27,415 --> 01:06:36,641
[SPEAKER_12]: Why should I buy that bundle when I can buy a bundle with World Tour and I can buy the game only of Band Hero for the same price as buying the bundle for Band Hero?

852
01:06:36,981 --> 01:06:38,322
[SPEAKER_12]: It makes no sense whatsoever.

853
01:06:39,262 --> 01:06:41,144
[SPEAKER_12]: So, I don't know.

854
01:06:41,404 --> 01:06:52,991
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, it does seem kind of a rip-off to be spending that kind of money on a bundle that is readily available right now for a cheaper price.

855
01:06:54,632 --> 01:06:56,113
[SPEAKER_12]: And yeah, it looks like World Tour...

856
01:06:57,520 --> 01:07:09,778
[SPEAKER_12]: The Band Kits Okay, $190 So they're still pretty expensive Um Actually $190 Right now that wouldn't be that But that's still $10 more than, you know Yeah

857
01:07:11,021 --> 01:07:14,322
[SPEAKER_11]: But, you know, for $10, even $10 is $10 still.

858
01:07:14,643 --> 01:07:14,863
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

859
01:07:15,423 --> 01:07:19,044
[SPEAKER_11]: Especially considering, you know, they're not bringing that much new to the table, it sounds like.

860
01:07:19,465 --> 01:07:20,765
[SPEAKER_11]: But here's my thing.

861
01:07:20,825 --> 01:07:25,307
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm going back to the DJ Hero thing for a minute because I'm excited about DJ Hero.

862
01:07:25,327 --> 01:07:26,988
[SPEAKER_11]: It looks like the game's going to be pretty cool.

863
01:07:28,108 --> 01:07:29,369
[SPEAKER_11]: The song list looks pretty awesome.

864
01:07:29,409 --> 01:07:31,750
[SPEAKER_11]: It looks innovative and this whole thing.

865
01:07:32,490 --> 01:07:35,251
[SPEAKER_11]: But when I heard it was $120, it was like getting kicked in the crotch.

866
01:07:35,752 --> 01:07:35,932
[SPEAKER_11]: Like...

867
01:07:38,274 --> 01:07:40,376
[SPEAKER_11]: $120 is a lot of money.

868
01:07:40,656 --> 01:07:44,921
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll tell you what, if they had said $99, I would have been like, sold, gonna buy it, I'm there.

869
01:07:45,502 --> 01:07:46,643
[SPEAKER_11]: Yep, I got it, day one.

870
01:07:47,804 --> 01:07:51,068
[SPEAKER_11]: But it's that third digit that makes all the difference in my mind.

871
01:07:53,070 --> 01:07:54,390
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know what it is.

872
01:07:54,430 --> 01:07:55,371
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm very disappointed.

873
01:08:09,525 --> 01:08:38,360
[SPEAKER_12]: I like to travel with my game consoles and peripherals and stuff like that, so that, you know, would appeal to me, but I want to see what I'm getting for this $120, because it's kind of expensive for, you know, and I know the peripheral is kind of neat, but I'm sorry, it's a turntable, it can't be that sophisticated, it's, we've had Beatmania controllers out there, and I mean, really, we're not talking too much different than that, and hell, the guitars aren't even that sophisticated, so...

874
01:08:40,532 --> 01:08:41,473
[SPEAKER_12]: Where's the money going?

875
01:08:42,694 --> 01:08:44,716
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I'm curious about that too.

876
01:08:45,296 --> 01:08:48,799
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think what also really sucks is that you can't really demo DJ Hero.

877
01:08:48,859 --> 01:08:49,380
[SPEAKER_11]: You know what I mean?

878
01:08:49,720 --> 01:08:54,524
[SPEAKER_12]: You're going to have to either play it in a store, play it at a friend's, or take a chance.

879
01:08:54,764 --> 01:08:56,226
[SPEAKER_12]: And you want to hear something funny?

880
01:08:57,286 --> 01:09:04,673
[SPEAKER_12]: This is coming from a company that's bitching about the price being too high for the PlayStation 3.

881
01:09:05,854 --> 01:09:06,154
[SPEAKER_12]: Funny.

882
01:09:06,234 --> 01:09:07,235
[SPEAKER_12]: I didn't even think about that.

883
01:09:07,575 --> 01:09:08,356
[SPEAKER_12]: You're absolutely right.

884
01:09:10,233 --> 01:09:11,974
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, the PlayStation 3 is too high.

885
01:09:12,514 --> 01:09:16,215
[SPEAKER_12]: Hell, that's almost the price of our, what is it, Band Hero.

886
01:09:16,235 --> 01:09:22,336
[SPEAKER_12]: If they drop the PlayStation 3 price another $100, it will be the price of their Band Hero bundle.

887
01:09:24,397 --> 01:09:25,977
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm sorry, that seems kind of a rip-off to me.

888
01:09:29,518 --> 01:09:30,799
[SPEAKER_12]: But, at the same time...

889
01:09:32,637 --> 01:09:33,437
[SPEAKER_12]: Band Hero was Band Hero

890
01:09:56,568 --> 01:09:58,149
[SPEAKER_11]: And I do a show about games every week.

891
01:09:58,189 --> 01:09:59,370
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm supposed to be on top of this stuff.

892
01:09:59,750 --> 01:10:02,232
[SPEAKER_11]: I literally thought Guitar Hero 5 was just called Band Hero.

893
01:10:02,392 --> 01:10:03,133
[SPEAKER_11]: I thought that's what it was.

894
01:10:03,333 --> 01:10:04,093
[SPEAKER_11]: It was the same game.

895
01:10:04,534 --> 01:10:06,135
[SPEAKER_11]: I was like, no, they're putting out two?

896
01:10:06,815 --> 01:10:07,076
[SPEAKER_11]: Really?

897
01:10:07,736 --> 01:10:08,376
[SPEAKER_12]: Do we need that?

898
01:10:09,577 --> 01:10:12,299
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, okay, Van Halen's coming out at the beginning of August.

899
01:10:12,639 --> 01:10:15,021
[SPEAKER_12]: Guitar Hero 5's coming out at the beginning of September.

900
01:10:15,702 --> 01:10:18,063
[SPEAKER_12]: Band Hero's coming out in October.

901
01:10:19,204 --> 01:10:19,845
[SPEAKER_12]: That's too much.

902
01:10:21,005 --> 01:10:21,566
[SPEAKER_11]: That is a lot.

903
01:10:22,509 --> 01:10:24,710
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know why I'm... Yeah, I don't know.

904
01:10:24,750 --> 01:10:25,331
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not feeling it.

905
01:10:25,431 --> 01:10:29,613
[SPEAKER_11]: Especially, you know, they're going to charge like 50 bucks for Guitar Hero Van Halen.

906
01:10:29,813 --> 01:10:30,273
[SPEAKER_11]: It's too much.

907
01:10:30,894 --> 01:10:31,054
[SPEAKER_11]: Yep.

908
01:10:31,194 --> 01:10:31,494
[SPEAKER_11]: Too much.

909
01:10:32,074 --> 01:10:34,255
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, well, I guess that's them.

910
01:10:34,636 --> 01:10:38,277
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll see how this sells, of course, and how you guys anticipate it.

911
01:10:38,358 --> 01:10:38,998
[SPEAKER_11]: Not a lot of chat.

912
01:10:39,018 --> 01:10:40,359
[SPEAKER_11]: They're talking about pay goal in the chat room.

913
01:10:40,739 --> 01:10:43,600
[SPEAKER_11]: I guess there's not a lot of care about DJ Hero or Band Hero.

914
01:10:43,640 --> 01:10:44,021
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

915
01:10:44,741 --> 01:10:45,962
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, well, that's what it is.

916
01:10:46,302 --> 01:10:48,383
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's shift topics and talk about another game.

917
01:10:50,001 --> 01:10:54,585
[SPEAKER_11]: This game definitely has its cult following, which used to be me many years ago.

918
01:10:55,465 --> 01:10:56,486
[SPEAKER_11]: Magic the Gathering.

919
01:10:57,307 --> 01:10:57,927
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, hey, hey.

920
01:10:59,628 --> 01:11:02,791
[SPEAKER_01]: That was me in college in Alabama.

921
01:11:03,348 --> 01:11:21,012
[SPEAKER_11]: and it was me in high school many years ago actually I've actually got a couple magic decks over here I got them for free here's the thing about Magic the Gathering say what you will call me whatever name you want in the book I do think Magic the Gathering is actually a lot of fun it's just a good game like I think it's a good card game to play but

922
01:11:23,018 --> 01:11:23,638
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

923
01:11:44,912 --> 01:11:45,792
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

924
01:12:07,399 --> 01:12:09,680
[SPEAKER_11]: I guess, yeah.

925
01:12:09,840 --> 01:12:12,281
[SPEAKER_11]: In the full version of the game, you can kind of make your own deck.

926
01:12:12,601 --> 01:12:19,643
[SPEAKER_11]: You can do your own thing with it, you know, and add the cards that are there, and you gain and lose cards as you fight enemies and so forth.

927
01:12:20,844 --> 01:12:24,265
[SPEAKER_11]: So yeah, it's hard for me, and like Lazy Days in chat says, demos don't count.

928
01:12:24,325 --> 01:12:28,806
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, I don't want to base my evaluation of the game off of it, so I'm not going to tell you whether to buy it or not.

929
01:12:28,846 --> 01:12:34,028
[SPEAKER_11]: I will just say, you know, it was kind of neat to see a resurgence of Magic the Gathering.

930
01:12:34,488 --> 01:12:35,209
[SPEAKER_11]: Magic the Gathering

931
01:12:50,711 --> 01:12:53,732
[SPEAKER_11]: You have the card, good old card and table and all that stuff.

932
01:12:54,253 --> 01:12:56,054
[SPEAKER_11]: Or you have Magic the Gathering Online.

933
01:12:56,954 --> 01:13:05,698
[SPEAKER_11]: The interesting thing about Magic the Gathering Online, they have really tried to mirror the card playing experience right on down to what you pay for it.

934
01:13:07,179 --> 01:13:11,201
[SPEAKER_11]: If you weren't aware, if you want to play Magic the Gathering Online, it's essentially free.

935
01:13:11,681 --> 01:13:12,301
[SPEAKER_11]: You have to pay $10.

936
01:13:13,101 --> 01:13:14,082
[SPEAKER_11]: I did a little research today.

937
01:13:14,122 --> 01:13:16,883
[SPEAKER_11]: I've never played Magic the Gathering Online, but I did some research.

938
01:13:16,943 --> 01:13:18,304
[SPEAKER_11]: If I wanted to play, what would it take?

939
01:13:19,502 --> 01:13:25,445
[SPEAKER_11]: You pay like a $10 registration fee, but that $10 goes towards a coupon that you use in their store.

940
01:13:26,465 --> 01:13:30,247
[SPEAKER_11]: And you buy decks just like walking into a comic book store and buying a deck.

941
01:13:30,607 --> 01:13:36,811
[SPEAKER_11]: You buy booster packs just like you would buy a booster pack in a store of 12 random cards or what have you.

942
01:13:37,551 --> 01:13:39,832
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's the same price with tax and all that stuff.

943
01:13:40,212 --> 01:13:42,233
[SPEAKER_11]: So you literally, but they make it very clear.

944
01:13:42,934 --> 01:13:43,534
[SPEAKER_11]: There is no...

945
01:13:44,329 --> 01:13:44,689
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura.com

946
01:14:00,399 --> 01:14:04,043
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

947
01:14:18,918 --> 01:14:44,670
[SPEAKER_11]: um and this is from an interview on destructoid.com senior brand manager worth woolport actually was quoted saying a good way to think of it is like the old theme decks or our current intro decks it's that kind of option to add on to your gaming experience and it's all set it's not randomized at all by the way they're also going to have themes play mats like the background you can buy yeah and gamer pictures okay but at

948
01:14:45,991 --> 01:14:48,192
[SPEAKER_01]: But what about for the people that's over it?

949
01:14:48,252 --> 01:14:51,993
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, what appeal is it going to have for all the people who've moved on?

950
01:14:53,193 --> 01:14:55,133
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there anything that's going to bring anyone back?

951
01:14:55,593 --> 01:14:58,614
[SPEAKER_01]: What about the face-to-face playing with somebody?

952
01:14:59,354 --> 01:15:00,255
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I don't know.

953
01:15:00,975 --> 01:15:08,697
[SPEAKER_11]: Actually, to be honest, Jamie, I think this is it to bring the old people back is that you don't have to put up with the boosters and all these extra little costs here.

954
01:15:08,857 --> 01:15:13,358
[SPEAKER_11]: In a way, I think if I was going to play Magic the Gathering more regularly, this is appealing to me.

955
01:15:13,649 --> 01:15:24,615
[SPEAKER_01]: When I played Magic regularly, I loved being able to collect all the rare cards and to have the collection that other people went, ooh.

956
01:15:24,635 --> 01:15:31,859
[SPEAKER_11]: But wouldn't it bug you when someone, when you were playing, would pull out that effing card that is so rare there's no way in hell you're going to get it?

957
01:15:32,219 --> 01:15:34,301
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, that type of thing, and then it's being used in a match.

958
01:15:34,621 --> 01:15:39,304
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, one thing you can say about the Microsoft way of doing it on Xbox Live, everybody's on the same page.

959
01:15:39,524 --> 01:15:40,545
[SPEAKER_11]: Everybody's on equal footing.

960
01:15:40,725 --> 01:15:41,926
[SPEAKER_01]: See, that's not fun to me.

961
01:15:42,086 --> 01:15:48,850
[SPEAKER_01]: If I wanted to play, you know, a certain type of match, you know, I would say, hey, do you have a Type 2 deck?

962
01:15:48,870 --> 01:15:49,831
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have a Type 1 deck?

963
01:15:50,331 --> 01:15:52,032
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, do you have old school Type 1?

964
01:15:52,072 --> 01:15:53,113
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't even know what that means.

965
01:15:53,173 --> 01:15:53,573
[SPEAKER_11]: That's funny.

966
01:15:53,733 --> 01:15:54,574
[SPEAKER_01]: That's for tournament.

967
01:15:54,594 --> 01:15:55,555
[SPEAKER_01]: I used to do tournament play.

968
01:15:56,747 --> 01:15:57,208
[SPEAKER_01]: Back in the day.

969
01:15:57,708 --> 01:16:02,851
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just say like, hey, you know, if you've got this type of deck, then we'll play this kind of game.

970
01:16:03,312 --> 01:16:07,835
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to bring out the strong stuff, you know, we would actually set up those parameters first.

971
01:16:08,295 --> 01:16:12,578
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was a much broader scope of play if you had this together.

972
01:16:12,698 --> 01:16:18,542
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen people take out wimpy ass starter pack decks and beat people with, you know...

973
01:16:19,122 --> 01:16:24,610
[SPEAKER_01]: The Hardcore Expensive Deck Just Because They Were A Better Player Not Everyone Is Going To Be Equal

974
01:16:36,055 --> 01:16:41,139
[SPEAKER_01]: You may be able to match the cards for everybody, but you're never going to match the skill.

975
01:16:41,760 --> 01:16:45,964
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that that really takes away a lot of the experience and play.

976
01:16:46,064 --> 01:16:48,406
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, from what I understand, you still build your own deck.

977
01:16:48,686 --> 01:16:51,108
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just that everybody has the same card pool to build from.

978
01:16:51,308 --> 01:16:51,989
[SPEAKER_10]: And yeah, okay.

979
01:16:52,409 --> 01:16:53,871
[SPEAKER_11]: You're a collector by nature, Jamie.

980
01:16:54,031 --> 01:16:55,352
[SPEAKER_11]: You collect video games.

981
01:16:55,692 --> 01:16:56,553
[SPEAKER_11]: You collect systems.

982
01:16:56,873 --> 01:16:58,034
[SPEAKER_11]: You collect lots of stuff.

983
01:16:58,395 --> 01:16:59,556
[SPEAKER_11]: You're a collector by nature.

984
01:16:59,736 --> 01:17:00,777
[SPEAKER_11]: I can see your argument.

985
01:17:01,257 --> 01:17:01,637
[SPEAKER_11]: For me...

986
01:17:02,520 --> 01:17:03,341
[SPEAKER_11]: That's too much money.

987
01:17:04,802 --> 01:17:05,483
[SPEAKER_11]: I can't do it.

988
01:17:05,863 --> 01:17:06,504
[SPEAKER_01]: I will tell you.

989
01:17:07,224 --> 01:17:08,746
[SPEAKER_11]: I spent a lot of money on this as a kid.

990
01:17:08,906 --> 01:17:09,827
[SPEAKER_01]: My first collection.

991
01:17:11,308 --> 01:17:12,790
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right, you were a kid, weren't you?

992
01:17:14,772 --> 01:17:15,552
[SPEAKER_01]: I was playing in college.

993
01:17:16,353 --> 01:17:18,055
[SPEAKER_11]: I wasn't that far behind you.

994
01:17:18,095 --> 01:17:20,317
[SPEAKER_11]: I was playing this when I was a sophomore, junior in high school.

995
01:17:20,337 --> 01:17:21,418
[SPEAKER_11]: You were what, two years older than me?

996
01:17:21,718 --> 01:17:24,240
[SPEAKER_11]: So right around the same there.

997
01:17:24,741 --> 01:17:25,562
[SPEAKER_11]: Loki was a child.

998
01:17:26,192 --> 01:17:27,772
[SPEAKER_11]: Just kidding, I was not a child.

999
01:17:28,272 --> 01:17:40,055
[SPEAKER_01]: But the whole thing is that I actually built up a collection, sold it for about $1,500 of D&D books, which I still have, and then promptly rebuilt my collection.

1000
01:17:40,755 --> 01:17:43,756
[SPEAKER_01]: Just because, you know, it's its own currency.

1001
01:17:43,776 --> 01:17:45,777
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to be smart with the building and trading.

1002
01:17:46,597 --> 01:17:50,098
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, my last collection, by that time, I didn't care anymore.

1003
01:17:50,118 --> 01:17:51,678
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody wanted to pay what it was worth.

1004
01:17:52,678 --> 01:17:54,579
[SPEAKER_01]: But still, it's a matter of...

1005
01:17:56,279 --> 01:17:57,100
[SPEAKER_01]: What are you in it for?

1006
01:17:59,161 --> 01:18:03,285
[SPEAKER_01]: For a lot of people, the fun comes not just in the playing, but in the having.

1007
01:18:04,686 --> 01:18:06,267
[SPEAKER_11]: Our good friend Marissa is in chat.

1008
01:18:06,307 --> 01:18:09,669
[SPEAKER_11]: Marissa Congusto says, I was in elementary school for the win.

1009
01:18:10,770 --> 01:18:14,873
[SPEAKER_11]: Don't I feel like grandpa?

1010
01:18:14,973 --> 01:18:15,914
[SPEAKER_11]: We do love Marissa, though.

1011
01:18:16,394 --> 01:18:18,036
[SPEAKER_11]: And we want her to come visit the show, by the way.

1012
01:18:18,536 --> 01:18:19,597
[SPEAKER_01]: Marissa!

1013
01:18:19,617 --> 01:18:19,757
[SPEAKER_01]: Marissa!

1014
01:18:20,712 --> 01:18:22,513
[SPEAKER_11]: or Jamie and I are just going to have to end up in L.A.

1015
01:18:22,533 --> 01:18:23,634
[SPEAKER_11]: the same weekend and make that happen.

1016
01:18:24,014 --> 01:18:26,996
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, and Loki somehow is going to have to be talked into making the trip.

1017
01:18:27,837 --> 01:18:28,177
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's see.

1018
01:18:28,677 --> 01:18:44,367
[SPEAKER_11]: I do want to say, though, what else I thought was interesting about this whole Magic the Gathering story was that they also, in this interview, the brand manager would not really say how much it's going to cost because he says, as far as price, all that stuff is dictated by Microsoft.

1019
01:18:44,827 --> 01:18:45,448
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you for watching!

1020
01:19:05,310 --> 01:19:11,515
[SPEAKER_11]: What some people have spent lots more money on another online gaming platform to have.

1021
01:19:12,276 --> 01:19:13,437
[SPEAKER_11]: That's fascinating to me.

1022
01:19:13,497 --> 01:19:14,077
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know why.

1023
01:19:14,718 --> 01:19:15,659
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe I'm just weird.

1024
01:19:16,019 --> 01:19:17,260
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe it's the memories I have.

1025
01:19:17,360 --> 01:19:21,503
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm sure they would have done booster packs and stuff if they had a way to do random cards like that.

1026
01:19:21,644 --> 01:19:29,270
[SPEAKER_12]: But because it's pay X amount of points, download this data, done.

1027
01:19:29,390 --> 01:19:31,992
[SPEAKER_12]: It's just... I don't know.

1028
01:19:33,353 --> 01:19:34,094
[SPEAKER_12]: You can't do it.

1029
01:19:36,827 --> 01:19:58,352
[SPEAKER_11]: for them I do want to check out the full version of the game though I think I will probably as soon as I finish up some of this Final Fantasy and other stuff I've been playing I'll probably get a little more into Magic the Gathering and I would love to play Jamie on Xbox Live but I don't know if she'll want to spend the 10 bucks it might be fun though it really has been years me too I have two decks here on my desk Rob

1030
01:20:00,993 --> 01:20:05,755
[SPEAKER_11]: When I was going through that tutorial, I was like, oh my god, this is almost too much to remember.

1031
01:20:06,195 --> 01:20:08,936
[SPEAKER_11]: Wait, I have to hit a button to interrupt if I want to actually use this?

1032
01:20:09,396 --> 01:20:10,697
[SPEAKER_11]: So, oh my gosh, she really does.

1033
01:20:10,717 --> 01:20:11,497
[SPEAKER_11]: She just whipped it out.

1034
01:20:11,997 --> 01:20:13,938
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a sealed deck, for god's sake.

1035
01:20:15,078 --> 01:20:16,119
[SPEAKER_01]: I challenge you, Rob.

1036
01:20:16,319 --> 01:20:19,220
[SPEAKER_11]: Ready to play 30-card deck and quick start guide.

1037
01:20:19,720 --> 01:20:21,100
[SPEAKER_11]: For real, these are two starter decks?

1038
01:20:21,240 --> 01:20:21,961
[SPEAKER_01]: Two starter decks.

1039
01:20:22,601 --> 01:20:23,481
[SPEAKER_01]: I challenge you, Rob.

1040
01:20:23,501 --> 01:20:25,002
[SPEAKER_11]: We should have a battle on this show.

1041
01:20:26,530 --> 01:20:27,971
[SPEAKER_11]: Not right now.

1042
01:20:27,991 --> 01:20:29,732
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe it's a special one-off show or something.

1043
01:20:29,752 --> 01:20:33,594
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a white deck and a green deck, which means it'll be a fucking long game.

1044
01:20:35,935 --> 01:20:38,617
[SPEAKER_11]: We should do this as a special spin-off show or something.

1045
01:20:38,897 --> 01:20:40,918
[SPEAKER_11]: And maybe Loki can provide commentary.

1046
01:20:41,578 --> 01:20:43,499
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know what the hell's going on, nor do I care.

1047
01:20:43,619 --> 01:20:45,180
[SPEAKER_11]: That would be what was funny about it.

1048
01:20:45,480 --> 01:20:48,022
[SPEAKER_01]: If this has that phasing bullshit in it, though, I'm out.

1049
01:20:49,352 --> 01:20:50,273
[SPEAKER_11]: What the hell is phasing?

1050
01:20:50,293 --> 01:20:51,413
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't even know what that is.

1051
01:20:51,453 --> 01:20:59,599
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, I stopped playing when they put in phasing, which means one card is in play for one turn, and then you have to skip the next one with that card, so they phase.

1052
01:21:00,219 --> 01:21:00,680
[SPEAKER_01]: Bullshit.

1053
01:21:01,780 --> 01:21:02,061
[SPEAKER_10]: Weird.

1054
01:21:02,581 --> 01:21:03,301
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry, Rob.

1055
01:21:03,361 --> 01:21:04,863
[SPEAKER_01]: My deck was black-red.

1056
01:21:06,123 --> 01:21:11,187
[SPEAKER_01]: I would spawn thralls and throw fireballs, and people hated it.

1057
01:21:12,478 --> 01:21:13,599
[SPEAKER_11]: This battle is happening.

1058
01:21:13,779 --> 01:21:14,639
[SPEAKER_11]: This must happen.

1059
01:21:15,019 --> 01:21:15,859
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got the white deck.

1060
01:21:15,879 --> 01:21:16,579
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got the green deck.

1061
01:21:16,659 --> 01:21:16,880
[SPEAKER_11]: Fine.

1062
01:21:16,920 --> 01:21:17,220
[SPEAKER_11]: Whatever.

1063
01:21:17,280 --> 01:21:17,620
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't care.

1064
01:21:17,680 --> 01:21:19,260
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you're holding the white deck, so I'm just saying.

1065
01:21:20,081 --> 01:21:20,821
[SPEAKER_11]: We need to set a time.

1066
01:21:20,921 --> 01:21:21,641
[SPEAKER_01]: Sealed deck tourney.

1067
01:21:21,821 --> 01:21:22,021
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright.

1068
01:21:22,041 --> 01:21:22,841
[SPEAKER_11]: Sealed deck tourney.

1069
01:21:22,861 --> 01:21:23,762
[SPEAKER_11]: Between you and me.

1070
01:21:25,222 --> 01:21:26,462
[SPEAKER_11]: And I haven't played in years.

1071
01:21:26,542 --> 01:21:29,103
[SPEAKER_01]: Neither have I. And they are sealed.

1072
01:21:29,183 --> 01:21:30,224
[SPEAKER_01]: Completely sealed.

1073
01:21:30,364 --> 01:21:34,685
[SPEAKER_01]: I will take a picture and put it on the website so that you can see that they're sealed.

1074
01:21:35,125 --> 01:21:37,946
[SPEAKER_01]: How about we do this on... What are you doing on Wednesday, Robb?

1075
01:21:38,871 --> 01:21:41,659
[SPEAKER_11]: I have to check with the significant other, but I think I will be free.

1076
01:21:42,983 --> 01:21:44,167
[SPEAKER_01]: Bring the significant other.

1077
01:21:44,247 --> 01:21:44,688
[SPEAKER_01]: It's on.

1078
01:21:45,287 --> 01:21:47,689
[SPEAKER_11]: He's going to think it's the dumbest thing you've ever seen in your life.

1079
01:21:47,709 --> 01:21:49,770
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to get sandwiches and beer.

1080
01:21:50,571 --> 01:21:51,231
[SPEAKER_01]: No, not beer.

1081
01:21:51,611 --> 01:21:54,593
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to get sandwiches and lemonade and play Magic.

1082
01:21:54,753 --> 01:21:59,737
[SPEAKER_11]: If this weekend wasn't birthday slash pride slash whatever, I would say let's do it this weekend.

1083
01:21:59,977 --> 01:22:01,798
[SPEAKER_11]: And then you're going to Las Vegas the next week, huh?

1084
01:22:02,158 --> 01:22:02,258
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

1085
01:22:02,278 --> 01:22:03,019
[SPEAKER_11]: So you're going to be gone.

1086
01:22:03,739 --> 01:22:05,100
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, we'll make it happen.

1087
01:22:05,120 --> 01:22:06,361
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll figure something out behind the scenes.

1088
01:22:07,222 --> 01:22:08,422
[SPEAKER_01]: This is going to be.

1089
01:22:09,323 --> 01:22:10,044
[SPEAKER_01]: It will be.

1090
01:22:10,364 --> 01:22:10,604
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

1091
01:22:11,424 --> 01:22:15,047
[SPEAKER_11]: And, of course, the chat is very supportive of the whole Magic the Gathering sealed deck tournament.

1092
01:22:17,083 --> 01:22:18,544
[SPEAKER_11]: We should turn it into a drinking game.

1093
01:22:19,145 --> 01:22:20,286
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got the geekery.

1094
01:22:20,486 --> 01:22:22,908
[SPEAKER_11]: Instead of 20 life points, we should have 20 shot glasses.

1095
01:22:22,928 --> 01:22:25,149
[SPEAKER_01]: God, Rob, this is so fucking ridiculous.

1096
01:22:25,250 --> 01:22:27,872
[SPEAKER_12]: Especially since... How would you get your life back?

1097
01:22:28,892 --> 01:22:29,993
[SPEAKER_12]: You just... I don't know.

1098
01:22:30,213 --> 01:22:33,676
[SPEAKER_01]: Especially since I haven't really wanted to play Magic in forever.

1099
01:22:33,816 --> 01:22:35,457
[SPEAKER_01]: I just got the decks because they were freaking free.

1100
01:22:36,018 --> 01:22:38,580
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought I'd give them to somebody or we'd give them away on the show.

1101
01:22:39,020 --> 01:22:39,921
[SPEAKER_01]: How about this?

1102
01:22:40,581 --> 01:22:43,704
[SPEAKER_01]: How about the winning deck is a giveaway?

1103
01:22:43,724 --> 01:22:43,804
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

1104
01:22:44,400 --> 01:22:44,680
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura.com

1105
01:23:11,570 --> 01:23:12,671
[SPEAKER_01]: A whole crap ton of stuff.

1106
01:23:13,792 --> 01:23:16,234
[SPEAKER_01]: We have on the 23rd, Fallout 3 point lookout.

1107
01:23:16,855 --> 01:23:19,918
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we've got on the 26th, a whole bunch of stuff.

1108
01:23:20,038 --> 01:23:22,300
[SPEAKER_01]: Another code R, Journey into Lost Memories.

1109
01:23:24,022 --> 01:23:26,624
[SPEAKER_01]: Arma 2, is that it?

1110
01:23:27,485 --> 01:23:31,389
[SPEAKER_01]: Dynasty Warriors 6 Empires, Fight Night Round 4, Guitar Hero Greatest Hits.

1111
01:23:31,909 --> 01:23:32,409
[SPEAKER_01]: Blah.

1112
01:23:33,810 --> 01:23:41,572
[SPEAKER_01]: Monster Hunter Freedom Unite, Overlord 2, Overlord Dark Legends, Overlord Minions, and Prinny Can I Really Be a Hero?

1113
01:23:42,872 --> 01:23:44,853
[SPEAKER_01]: And Superstars V8 Racing.

1114
01:23:47,734 --> 01:23:49,794
[SPEAKER_12]: Cool.

1115
01:23:49,974 --> 01:23:50,614
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's see.

1116
01:23:52,175 --> 01:23:56,036
[SPEAKER_12]: In the US, we've actually got a little bit coming out this week.

1117
01:23:57,076 --> 01:23:58,897
[SPEAKER_12]: Starting off, we've got...

1118
01:24:01,139 --> 01:24:06,283
[SPEAKER_12]: Monster Hunter Freedom Unite Dynasty Warriors 6 Empires Transformers Revenge of the Fallen

1119
01:24:18,272 --> 01:24:23,034
[SPEAKER_12]: Split up between Autobots and Decepticons to celebrate the new movie coming out this week.

1120
01:24:23,914 --> 01:24:29,236
[SPEAKER_12]: My Healthy Cooking Coach for the DS and Enhanced for the DSi with lots of recipes.

1121
01:24:29,296 --> 01:24:32,257
[SPEAKER_12]: In fact, you get some exclusive recipes if you have the DSi system.

1122
01:24:32,317 --> 01:24:33,618
[SPEAKER_12]: That is such bullshit.

1123
01:24:34,078 --> 01:24:34,698
[SPEAKER_12]: It is crap.

1124
01:24:34,738 --> 01:24:35,098
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, it is.

1125
01:24:35,158 --> 01:24:35,978
[SPEAKER_12]: I am sorry.

1126
01:24:36,178 --> 01:24:36,939
[SPEAKER_11]: That's Ubisoft.

1127
01:24:36,979 --> 01:24:38,379
[SPEAKER_12]: You can thank Ubisoft for that.

1128
01:24:39,600 --> 01:24:40,000
[SPEAKER_12]: Overlord.

1129
01:24:40,020 --> 01:24:40,160
[SPEAKER_12]: Ubisoft.

1130
01:24:40,640 --> 01:24:44,344
[SPEAKER_12]: Overlord 2 coming out on PS3 and Xbox 360.

1131
01:24:45,265 --> 01:24:51,131
[SPEAKER_12]: Overlord Minions on DS and Overlord Dark Legend on the Wii.

1132
01:24:52,352 --> 01:24:56,056
[SPEAKER_12]: And also this week, Resident Evil Archives.

1133
01:24:56,917 --> 01:25:00,260
[SPEAKER_12]: That's going to be your first, I guess...

1134
01:25:01,201 --> 01:25:02,141
[SPEAKER_12]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1135
01:25:31,187 --> 01:25:33,472
[SPEAKER_12]: Discovery Kids Parrot Pals yet another

1136
01:25:34,861 --> 01:25:36,322
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know, SimGame.

1137
01:25:37,422 --> 01:25:39,884
[SPEAKER_12]: I wonder if you can make the parrots repeat you in their parrot voice.

1138
01:25:39,904 --> 01:25:40,504
[SPEAKER_12]: That'd be kind of funny.

1139
01:25:41,785 --> 01:25:48,528
[SPEAKER_12]: The PlayStation 2 is getting a bundle of two of the PlayStation portable ports for Grand Theft Auto.

1140
01:25:49,108 --> 01:25:53,811
[SPEAKER_12]: Liberty City Stories and Bite City Stories bundle coming out for $30 retail.

1141
01:25:53,911 --> 01:25:54,831
[SPEAKER_12]: That's not too bad.

1142
01:25:56,032 --> 01:25:58,934
[SPEAKER_12]: And on DS, some more schlock.

1143
01:25:59,634 --> 01:26:02,035
[SPEAKER_12]: Fashion Week Junior Designer coming from 505 Games.

1144
01:26:04,377 --> 01:26:11,826
[SPEAKER_12]: and Dawn of Discovery, a real-time strategy game that's coming out on the Wii and I believe the DS.

1145
01:26:16,616 --> 01:26:20,578
[SPEAKER_12]: Classic Word Games, another one from Ubisoft, also enhanced for the DSi.

1146
01:26:22,919 --> 01:26:23,880
[SPEAKER_12]: That's coming out on DS.

1147
01:26:23,900 --> 01:26:26,181
[SPEAKER_11]: I just think that's a horrible thing to do to the casual audience.

1148
01:26:28,442 --> 01:26:30,503
[SPEAKER_11]: Not that these are games I would ever buy anyway.

1149
01:26:30,663 --> 01:26:33,565
[SPEAKER_11]: I just think that's a mean thing to do to the casual audience.

1150
01:26:34,165 --> 01:26:37,107
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not like you're using the new hardware for this.

1151
01:26:38,087 --> 01:26:39,328
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just plain and simple.

1152
01:26:39,388 --> 01:26:43,370
[SPEAKER_12]: All the enhancements for that cooking game, it was 20 more recipes.

1153
01:26:43,912 --> 01:26:48,235
[SPEAKER_12]: and you got to take your picture and put it in as the chef picture or something like that.

1154
01:26:48,455 --> 01:26:50,656
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, if that was the main enhancement, then fine.

1155
01:26:50,676 --> 01:26:55,439
[SPEAKER_11]: That is something that the DSi hardware can do that the DS just simply cannot do.

1156
01:26:55,819 --> 01:27:00,381
[SPEAKER_11]: But this whole withholding recipes or mini-games or what have you just sucks.

1157
01:27:02,242 --> 01:27:08,126
[SPEAKER_12]: Shimogane Tensei Devil Summoner on DS coming out this week and...

1158
01:27:10,170 --> 01:27:15,246
[SPEAKER_12]: and lastly, Hanya Fantasy Golf on PSP will be making out this week.

1159
01:27:15,889 --> 01:27:16,932
[SPEAKER_12]: And that is it.

1160
01:27:17,915 --> 01:27:18,876
[SPEAKER_11]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1161
01:27:44,651 --> 01:27:55,215
[SPEAKER_11]: Mamoru-kun wa Norowaerte Shimata comes out as well, which is a port from the arcades that...

1162
01:27:56,172 --> 01:27:57,592
[SPEAKER_11]: Agarest Senki Zero Ideafactory

1163
01:28:24,879 --> 01:28:32,342
[SPEAKER_11]: It kind of looks like a sim type of game mixed with a role-playing game, which could be kind of interesting.

1164
01:28:32,462 --> 01:28:38,123
[SPEAKER_11]: But that is coming out over there on the PlayStation 3, as well as another version of BlazBlue.

1165
01:28:38,884 --> 01:28:45,226
[SPEAKER_11]: And Fight Night Round 4 also making its way to the Asian region, so it pretty much matches the Xbox 360 dates pretty well.

1166
01:28:45,246 --> 01:28:49,507
[SPEAKER_11]: But they also have one other game, Rorona no Atelier 3.

1167
01:28:50,047 --> 01:29:13,062
[SPEAKER_11]: Arland no Renken Sushi comes out and that is on several different types of box sets and so forth and I do see that this guy is using like magical sushi in a role playing type of format there so I think that's got to be based on some other type of series over there the game looks very stylish though I will give it that it looks kind of neat

1168
01:29:14,451 --> 01:29:17,093
[SPEAKER_11]: coming out on some other systems on the Nintendo Wii.

1169
01:29:18,314 --> 01:29:22,658
[SPEAKER_11]: Wii Sports Resort, by the way, is coming out this week in Japan.

1170
01:29:22,778 --> 01:29:24,459
[SPEAKER_11]: That's a pretty big deal.

1171
01:29:25,020 --> 01:29:28,723
[SPEAKER_11]: So that is coming out in Japan, and that's really the only thing of note over there.

1172
01:29:29,424 --> 01:29:33,367
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm going to skip past PlayStation 2 dates and go straight to the Nintendo DS.

1173
01:29:33,827 --> 01:29:36,650
[SPEAKER_11]: Fushigi Yugi gets a game on the DS this week.

1174
01:29:37,530 --> 01:29:39,112
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a Fushigi Yugi game?

1175
01:29:40,293 --> 01:29:41,153
[SPEAKER_11]: On the DS this week.

1176
01:29:41,414 --> 01:29:41,814
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me see it.

1177
01:29:44,127 --> 01:29:46,348
[SPEAKER_11]: Bringing up some picture in studio to satisfy DarkSakura.

1178
01:29:46,428 --> 01:29:47,449
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, dear God.

1179
01:29:49,010 --> 01:29:49,510
[SPEAKER_11]: There it is.

1180
01:29:49,790 --> 01:29:52,652
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, it looks like it's kind of a sim type.

1181
01:29:53,253 --> 01:29:54,113
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, it definitely looks like a sim.

1182
01:29:54,133 --> 01:29:55,114
[SPEAKER_11]: It's Tusky.

1183
01:29:55,174 --> 01:29:58,296
[SPEAKER_11]: Fushugi Yugi is two romantic adventures combined into one DS card.

1184
01:29:58,596 --> 01:30:03,159
[SPEAKER_11]: Become the Miko destined to save a nation from calamity and meet all the handsome bodyguards along the way.

1185
01:30:03,539 --> 01:30:10,844
[SPEAKER_11]: The fans who have read the manga may already know who the heroines end up with, but now with you in the Miko's robes, you don't have to end things the way the anime or manga did.

1186
01:30:10,864 --> 01:30:11,064
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

1187
01:30:11,144 --> 01:30:11,964
[SPEAKER_01]: That sounds kind of fun.

1188
01:30:12,024 --> 01:30:13,025
[SPEAKER_01]: Too bad I can't read any of it.

1189
01:30:13,045 --> 01:30:16,005
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's kind of like reverse dating sim because now you get to date boys.

1190
01:30:17,086 --> 01:30:21,007
[SPEAKER_01]: That'd be fun if that one got a release over here, but I doubt it.

1191
01:30:21,127 --> 01:30:22,847
[SPEAKER_11]: And the game, I like the name of this game.

1192
01:30:22,867 --> 01:30:24,128
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a game called Really?

1193
01:30:24,568 --> 01:30:24,908
[SPEAKER_11]: Really?

1194
01:30:25,348 --> 01:30:25,728
[SPEAKER_11]: DS.

1195
01:30:26,508 --> 01:30:27,289
[SPEAKER_11]: That is the name of it.

1196
01:30:27,589 --> 01:30:27,869
[SPEAKER_11]: Really?

1197
01:30:27,969 --> 01:30:29,169
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, really?

1198
01:30:30,790 --> 01:30:32,230
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe that'll be the American release.

1199
01:30:32,290 --> 01:30:34,711
[SPEAKER_11]: Instead of about two girls, it'll be about an owl.

1200
01:30:35,551 --> 01:30:37,152
[SPEAKER_11]: Although that would be a completely different game altogether.

1201
01:30:38,252 --> 01:30:38,412
[SPEAKER_11]: Um...

1202
01:30:39,580 --> 01:30:42,702
[SPEAKER_11]: Although, from what I understand, Scribblenauts has the O'Reilly Owl in it.

1203
01:30:42,762 --> 01:30:43,342
[SPEAKER_11]: Sweet.

1204
01:30:44,082 --> 01:30:45,303
[SPEAKER_11]: All the more reason to buy it.

1205
01:30:45,623 --> 01:30:47,064
[SPEAKER_11]: Remember we told Bobby about it?

1206
01:30:47,184 --> 01:30:47,944
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh no, you weren't there.

1207
01:30:48,244 --> 01:30:50,705
[SPEAKER_11]: I told him to go try it the last day and I know he talked about it on his show.

1208
01:30:51,025 --> 01:30:52,446
[SPEAKER_11]: And I told him, do lolcats.

1209
01:30:52,546 --> 01:30:52,986
[SPEAKER_11]: It's funny.

1210
01:30:53,266 --> 01:30:55,548
[SPEAKER_11]: And I guess he tried the O'Reilly Owl and it actually worked.

1211
01:30:55,668 --> 01:30:56,288
[SPEAKER_11]: So there you go.

1212
01:30:57,188 --> 01:31:08,734
[SPEAKER_11]: Quickly on the PSP, I want to mention Memories Off After Rain comes out as well as Noko Aozora Ni Yakisuko Tenohira no Rakuun comes out.

1213
01:31:11,155 --> 01:31:14,738
[SPEAKER_11]: The cover art is this girl kneeling in the beach, reaching for your hand.

1214
01:31:15,258 --> 01:31:16,559
[SPEAKER_11]: It's probably another dating sim.

1215
01:31:16,659 --> 01:31:19,641
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh yeah, there's three people in bed together.

1216
01:31:19,982 --> 01:31:20,562
[SPEAKER_11]: What is that?

1217
01:31:20,982 --> 01:31:21,803
[SPEAKER_11]: No, it's probably a family.

1218
01:31:21,863 --> 01:31:22,824
[SPEAKER_11]: That's hot.

1219
01:31:24,085 --> 01:31:25,165
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not that hot.

1220
01:31:25,205 --> 01:31:27,087
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks like a dating sim.

1221
01:31:27,827 --> 01:31:28,568
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, so there you go.

1222
01:31:30,409 --> 01:31:33,251
[SPEAKER_11]: The best dating sims have three people in bed at once.

1223
01:31:34,732 --> 01:31:37,934
[SPEAKER_11]: By the way, the Fushugi Yugi got a big rise out of the chat room.

1224
01:31:38,015 --> 01:31:38,235
[SPEAKER_11]: What?

1225
01:31:38,255 --> 01:31:38,575
[SPEAKER_11]: What?

1226
01:31:39,522 --> 01:31:40,223
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, indeed.

1227
01:31:40,523 --> 01:31:40,863
[SPEAKER_11]: There it is.

1228
01:31:41,244 --> 01:31:43,866
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, hey, we're going to close out Part A and get into Part B tonight.

1229
01:31:44,406 --> 01:31:49,471
[SPEAKER_01]: We just had a mention of the Tokimeki Memorial, which is like the big dating sim series.

1230
01:31:50,211 --> 01:31:52,193
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, there is one for girls.

1231
01:31:52,313 --> 01:31:54,094
[SPEAKER_01]: It's called Tokimeki Memorial Girlside.

1232
01:31:54,455 --> 01:31:55,656
[SPEAKER_01]: I do believe it's called Girlside.

1233
01:31:56,343 --> 01:31:57,563
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1234
01:32:25,808 --> 01:32:28,209
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura is going to pick a game and share it with you all right now.

1235
01:32:28,249 --> 01:32:29,210
[SPEAKER_11]: The classic game of the week.

1236
01:32:30,510 --> 01:32:33,912
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a very interesting game called Silhouette Mirage.

1237
01:32:34,772 --> 01:32:36,453
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm surprised I haven't done this one before.

1238
01:32:36,673 --> 01:32:39,274
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, I think I haven't done it because I thought I had done it before.

1239
01:32:40,035 --> 01:32:41,175
[SPEAKER_10]: So, cue music?

1240
01:32:41,695 --> 01:32:42,536
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, ma'am.

1241
01:32:42,576 --> 01:32:44,877
[SPEAKER_11]: Here's some clip from Silhouette Mirage.

1242
01:32:45,097 --> 01:32:51,560
[SPEAKER_01]: This is actually from the Saturn version, which is the one that I really want most of all.

1243
01:32:53,397 --> 01:32:55,278
[SPEAKER_01]: It has really good music, by the way.

1244
01:32:55,438 --> 01:32:56,959
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a game that's put out by Treasure.

1245
01:32:59,100 --> 01:33:06,324
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was initially on the Sega Saturn and then had a PlayStation release.

1246
01:33:06,684 --> 01:33:12,927
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the Saturn Japanese release was in 1997 and then came out in 98 on PlayStation.

1247
01:33:12,967 --> 01:33:16,169
[SPEAKER_01]: And then Working Designs brought out the PlayStation version.

1248
01:33:17,110 --> 01:33:24,901
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, later, actually on, um, December 31st, 1999, which I have that version, and honestly, after playing the Saturn version, the Saturn version is better!

1249
01:33:25,742 --> 01:33:29,228
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but that's what happens with a lot of Saturn PlayStation conversions.

1250
01:33:30,296 --> 01:33:40,840
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, you basically play through the game where you have different sorts of natures.

1251
01:33:40,980 --> 01:33:43,021
[SPEAKER_01]: One is Silhouette, one is Mirage.

1252
01:33:44,042 --> 01:33:51,525
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you actually play as a character that has both of those attributes.

1253
01:33:51,625 --> 01:33:54,546
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if you can see in the movie file, Rob.

1254
01:33:55,207 --> 01:33:56,952
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, she's like flipping from blue to red.

1255
01:33:57,112 --> 01:33:59,961
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, when she moves one way, she's red, and when she moves the other, she's blue.

1256
01:33:59,981 --> 01:34:00,803
[SPEAKER_11]: That's kind of interesting.

1257
01:34:01,690 --> 01:34:18,682
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's very similar to Gunstar Heroes in how it plays, but you have to really make sure that you're the same type matches, which actually in the Japanese version you can't absorb it, but you can in the US one.

1258
01:34:19,382 --> 01:34:25,226
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you also have to make sure that you're attacking with the opposite type of whatever the creature you're fighting is.

1259
01:34:26,782 --> 01:34:28,644
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really, really difficult.

1260
01:34:28,764 --> 01:34:29,645
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, seriously.

1261
01:34:29,685 --> 01:34:33,729
[SPEAKER_01]: But then again, treasure games are freaking difficult.

1262
01:34:34,790 --> 01:34:44,300
[SPEAKER_01]: So basically, the main character is called Shina Nara Shina, which I thought they did something stupid to it in the U.S., so I'm not even going to bother with that.

1263
01:34:46,442 --> 01:34:49,725
[SPEAKER_01]: So she's very little, and she has both...

1264
01:34:50,726 --> 01:34:53,268
[SPEAKER_01]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1265
01:35:20,666 --> 01:35:28,929
[SPEAKER_01]: You actually get beings that will help you out that are based off the seven deadly sins.

1266
01:35:30,590 --> 01:35:30,970
[SPEAKER_01]: Sins.

1267
01:35:31,530 --> 01:35:32,610
[SPEAKER_01]: You get Sloth.

1268
01:35:33,471 --> 01:35:34,331
[SPEAKER_01]: You get Lusty.

1269
01:35:35,015 --> 01:35:38,397
[SPEAKER_01]: Angry, Gluttony, Envy, Covetous and Pride

1270
01:35:55,107 --> 01:36:01,431
[SPEAKER_01]: Some other things, you have the Reaper and Galoov bosses that are only in the PlayStation version.

1271
01:36:02,972 --> 01:36:07,955
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they actually modified the story, added a new dialogue, new levels, another ending.

1272
01:36:09,076 --> 01:36:15,040
[SPEAKER_01]: And they were intended for the Saturn version, but the rumor is that they rushed the Saturn version out and all that wasn't in it.

1273
01:36:17,582 --> 01:36:23,105
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, they made it harder for the American version, which I'm saying it was really freaking hard.

1274
01:36:23,626 --> 01:36:24,066
[SPEAKER_01]: They made it

1275
01:36:24,526 --> 01:36:25,387
[SPEAKER_01]: Harder.

1276
01:36:26,067 --> 01:36:27,388
[SPEAKER_01]: Seriously, harder.

1277
01:36:27,929 --> 01:36:29,630
[SPEAKER_01]: What you're seeing there, Rob, is easy.

1278
01:36:31,031 --> 01:36:31,711
[SPEAKER_01]: They made it hard.

1279
01:36:32,432 --> 01:36:36,394
[SPEAKER_01]: I really suck at the PlayStation American one.

1280
01:36:37,135 --> 01:36:38,876
[SPEAKER_01]: You also have a debug mode.

1281
01:36:38,896 --> 01:36:43,399
[SPEAKER_01]: You have Super Core Fighter 2, which you can play between Shaina and Zohar, one of the other characters.

1282
01:36:45,521 --> 01:36:47,842
[SPEAKER_01]: They also, of course, edited...

1283
01:36:50,328 --> 01:37:01,512
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of the sprites in the game, like one of them, a character, a cigarette was replaced with a gloved hand, you know, instead of holding a cigarette.

1284
01:37:02,332 --> 01:37:04,813
[SPEAKER_01]: And a burning cross was replaced with a dragon.

1285
01:37:06,153 --> 01:37:09,154
[SPEAKER_01]: So, but that is classic treasure.

1286
01:37:11,061 --> 01:37:14,104
[SPEAKER_11]: Another treasure to add to our pile in the classic game of the week.

1287
01:37:14,124 --> 01:37:15,405
[SPEAKER_11]: But they did do some great games.

1288
01:37:17,387 --> 01:37:32,020
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, if you want to look at the things Treasure's given us, Gunstar Heroes, Doki Doki Mischief Makers, Bangayo, Ikaruga, Radiant Silvergun.

1289
01:37:33,261 --> 01:37:33,922
[SPEAKER_01]: Seriously.

1290
01:37:34,582 --> 01:37:37,445
[SPEAKER_01]: Treasure is like, they're aptly named.

1291
01:37:38,155 --> 01:37:45,438
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, well there you go, your classic game of the week, Silhouette Mirage, available on the Saturn, or if you were in for a challenge, the PlayStation.

1292
01:37:46,258 --> 01:37:47,979
[SPEAKER_11]: So, there you go.

1293
01:37:50,060 --> 01:38:00,544
[SPEAKER_11]: That's going to do it for this Part A of our show, but we've got plenty more show when we come back, including our Part B tonight.

1294
01:38:01,184 --> 01:38:02,545
[SPEAKER_11]: We have the Rapid Fire News.

1295
01:38:03,427 --> 01:38:12,876
[SPEAKER_11]: We have some other discussion topics we're going to get into and of course your emails at mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com We will be back right after a quick break with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

1296
01:38:12,936 --> 01:38:13,477
[SPEAKER_11]: Stay tuned guys!

1297
01:38:19,898 --> 01:38:27,441
[SPEAKER_11]: And welcome back, everybody, here on this lovely Sunday evening, June the 21st of 2009, for Part B of Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 328.

1298
01:38:27,681 --> 01:38:33,563
[SPEAKER_11]: We tape live every week on allgames.com, available at radio.allgames.com.

1299
01:38:34,183 --> 01:38:36,744
[SPEAKER_11]: And we put out our podcast every week as well.

1300
01:38:37,424 --> 01:38:38,164
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks for watching!

1301
01:38:59,353 --> 01:39:01,916
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1302
01:39:23,775 --> 01:39:33,500
[SPEAKER_11]: In the same vein of Team Ninja, working with Nintendo to reimagine Metroid, what development group would you like to see partner and collaborate with Nintendo, and what franchise?

1303
01:39:33,960 --> 01:39:39,222
[SPEAKER_11]: So basically, to make it short, dream developer, dream franchise, but a Nintendo franchise.

1304
01:39:39,482 --> 01:39:46,926
[SPEAKER_11]: We're going to be getting into that a little later, and if you want to vote and participate in tonight's list list and have a say, chat.orangeloungeradio.com is the place to be.

1305
01:39:47,546 --> 01:39:50,348
[SPEAKER_11]: Meanwhile, we're getting some rapid fire news.

1306
01:39:50,928 --> 01:39:54,951
[SPEAKER_11]: Some topics that we're not going to talk a lot about, but we wanted to let you know what's going on anyway.

1307
01:39:55,271 --> 01:39:57,152
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, what's the rapid fire news tonight?

1308
01:39:58,133 --> 01:40:13,823
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, for our friends over in the UK, this is actually until July 3rd, you can get a gold subscription to Xbox Live for basically one pound.

1309
01:40:15,404 --> 01:40:16,525
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, of course...

1310
01:40:18,223 --> 01:40:21,688
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, afterwards, you can pay regular price if you want to keep it.

1311
01:40:22,149 --> 01:40:24,372
[SPEAKER_01]: But seriously, one quid for one month, that's not bad.

1312
01:40:26,475 --> 01:40:27,417
[SPEAKER_10]: Good way to get your foot in the door.

1313
01:40:28,015 --> 01:40:30,157
[SPEAKER_01]: Pretty much, see how you like it.

1314
01:40:30,317 --> 01:40:35,660
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, some games coming out, WiiWare and DSiWare.

1315
01:40:36,181 --> 01:40:43,065
[SPEAKER_01]: We actually have Let's Catch, which is put out by Yuji Naka.

1316
01:40:43,866 --> 01:40:49,950
[SPEAKER_01]: It's to go along with Let's Tap, so it's catching a game.

1317
01:40:50,410 --> 01:40:58,177
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we have Ikarian Kindred Spirits, where you play as a little winged girl called Nyx who is trying to find Icarus.

1318
01:41:00,179 --> 01:41:02,441
[SPEAKER_12]: Aren't we all trying to find the sequel to Icarus?

1319
01:41:04,002 --> 01:41:08,966
[SPEAKER_01]: Nay, you know, it could... I don't know if it's tied in, but hey, if it is, that would be sweet.

1320
01:41:09,807 --> 01:41:14,611
[SPEAKER_01]: And then DSiWare gets a game called A Little Bit of...

1321
01:41:16,610 --> 01:41:19,952
[SPEAKER_01]: Dr. Kalashima's Brain Training, Maths Edition.

1322
01:41:20,672 --> 01:41:22,873
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, it's math.

1323
01:41:23,613 --> 01:41:25,614
[SPEAKER_01]: Which means I won't be getting this freaking game.

1324
01:41:26,115 --> 01:41:27,575
[SPEAKER_01]: It's 800 Nintendo points, by the way.

1325
01:41:29,556 --> 01:41:33,338
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, last but not least, we have...

1326
01:41:34,662 --> 01:42:03,342
[SPEAKER_01]: Mass Effect for iPhone which is a side story actually there was an NDA leak that came out last month one of the testers blurted out all this crap so basically it's not a bridging story it's just a little side story about one of the Mass Effect 2 characters so it's just like a little fun option game so hey that's it

1327
01:42:04,707 --> 01:42:08,649
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, there's some interesting stuff coming out actually on TV.

1328
01:42:09,369 --> 01:42:12,231
[SPEAKER_12]: You may remember Penn & Teller's show Bullshit.

1329
01:42:12,371 --> 01:42:12,611
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

1330
01:42:12,871 --> 01:42:22,295
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, they are taking on JT Voldemort and talking about the evils of video games and violence and all that stuff.

1331
01:42:22,556 --> 01:42:29,499
[SPEAKER_12]: If you're interested in watching it, the episode will be available on July 9th is when it's supposed to air.

1332
01:42:29,899 --> 01:42:31,800
[SPEAKER_01]: You were talking about one of my favorite shows ever, by the way.

1333
01:42:35,404 --> 01:42:36,685
[SPEAKER_12]: XBOX Live Arcade

1334
01:42:55,390 --> 01:42:58,191
[SPEAKER_12]: Back in Japan in 1999, and in the U.S.

1335
01:42:58,231 --> 01:42:59,952
[SPEAKER_12]: as Fatal Fury, Mark of the Wolves.

1336
01:43:00,672 --> 01:43:02,793
[SPEAKER_12]: So, it is the final Fatal Fury title.

1337
01:43:04,074 --> 01:43:18,261
[SPEAKER_12]: And last week we had a new Wii game come out, and this is talking about a throwback to the old Laserdisc days, but Digital Leisure has a live-action shooter game you may remember as Mad Dog McCree.

1338
01:43:18,281 --> 01:43:19,101
[SPEAKER_12]: Little Bird.

1339
01:43:19,581 --> 01:43:34,937
[SPEAKER_12]: They had three games in that series, and all three of those are available for $19.99 in one new pack for the Wii, Mad Dog McCree's Gunslinger Pack, which includes Mad Dog McCree, Mad Dog 2, The Lost Gold, and The Last Bounty Hunter.

1340
01:43:35,718 --> 01:43:39,142
[SPEAKER_12]: So, very interesting and old-school crappiness.

1341
01:43:40,303 --> 01:43:40,403
[SPEAKER_12]: Um...

1342
01:43:41,764 --> 01:43:45,726
[SPEAKER_12]: Another game that's going to be heading its way to the Wii as well.

1343
01:43:46,306 --> 01:43:55,431
[SPEAKER_11]: Can I say though, those Matt Dogg McCree games are really trying to bank in on the nostalgia of those laser gun games and how cool they were at the time because it was like OMG video.

1344
01:43:55,811 --> 01:43:58,312
[SPEAKER_11]: But by today's standards, please.

1345
01:43:58,772 --> 01:44:00,373
[SPEAKER_12]: And they are $20 for all three games.

1346
01:44:00,473 --> 01:44:08,297
[SPEAKER_12]: So if you are really willing to buy it, I would suggest waiting for it to really hit the bargain bin.

1347
01:44:08,637 --> 01:44:10,738
[SPEAKER_11]: I guess that's a cool value, but still...

1348
01:44:12,851 --> 01:44:25,442
[SPEAKER_12]: A new Monkey Ball trademark has been discovered, and I guess based on the title, people are assuming it's going to be using the new... God, it just wouldn't be a week if I didn't have the wrong music kick in at the wrong time, huh?

1349
01:44:27,344 --> 01:44:28,084
[SPEAKER_12]: I can't stop it!

1350
01:44:28,144 --> 01:44:28,565
[SPEAKER_12]: There we go.

1351
01:44:28,725 --> 01:44:29,045
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

1352
01:44:29,625 --> 01:44:30,426
[SPEAKER_12]: It's cursed!

1353
01:44:30,887 --> 01:44:32,268
[SPEAKER_12]: The song is cursed!

1354
01:44:32,648 --> 01:44:33,229
[SPEAKER_12]: Apparently.

1355
01:44:35,095 --> 01:44:55,380
[SPEAKER_12]: much like the game Super Monkey Ball which now they've got a new one coming out, Step and Roll which people think, oh Step, the Wii balance board and hey, who doesn't like to whore out the Wii balance board so that game will probably be coming soon from Sega and then that's it

1356
01:44:57,264 --> 01:45:00,506
[SPEAKER_11]: I have a few stories I want to cover here real quick in Rapid Fire News as well.

1357
01:45:00,946 --> 01:45:03,268
[SPEAKER_11]: We're just going to start off with a story about the iPhone.

1358
01:45:03,308 --> 01:45:07,671
[SPEAKER_11]: Commodore 64 apparently has been ported over to the iPhone, which isn't much of a surprise.

1359
01:45:07,691 --> 01:45:08,892
[SPEAKER_11]: There's other emulators as well.

1360
01:45:09,212 --> 01:45:10,153
[SPEAKER_11]: But here's the thing.

1361
01:45:10,953 --> 01:45:18,418
[SPEAKER_11]: Apparently it is Manomio is the folks that put this thing together, a Commodore 64 app on the iPhone.

1362
01:45:18,438 --> 01:45:20,359
[SPEAKER_11]: They did this together with a Danish studio.

1363
01:45:21,140 --> 01:45:24,882
[SPEAKER_11]: Apparently you can actually run this whole thing on your iPhone.

1364
01:45:24,902 --> 01:45:25,443
[SPEAKER_11]: But guess what?

1365
01:45:25,603 --> 01:45:26,904
[SPEAKER_11]: Apple has rejected it.

1366
01:45:27,924 --> 01:45:28,224
[SPEAKER_11]: What?

1367
01:45:28,244 --> 01:45:28,345
[SPEAKER_11]: What?

1368
01:45:46,813 --> 01:45:50,774
[SPEAKER_11]: Apparently Space Invaders Extreme is going to be getting some download content.

1369
01:45:51,714 --> 01:45:53,675
[SPEAKER_11]: It's Xbox Live Arcade's version, of course.

1370
01:45:53,975 --> 01:45:56,535
[SPEAKER_11]: Going to be getting some extra stages and some things.

1371
01:45:57,436 --> 01:45:57,856
[SPEAKER_11]: There you go.

1372
01:45:57,916 --> 01:45:59,796
[SPEAKER_11]: It's 240 Microsoft points.

1373
01:46:00,596 --> 01:46:05,158
[SPEAKER_11]: I guess you get some reimagining of the original Space Invaders and Space Invaders 2.

1374
01:46:05,558 --> 01:46:06,358
[SPEAKER_12]: That's a pretty good price.

1375
01:46:06,378 --> 01:46:09,739
[SPEAKER_12]: 240 points for two games and some download content?

1376
01:46:09,799 --> 01:46:10,299
[SPEAKER_11]: Not much at all.

1377
01:46:11,465 --> 01:46:14,346
[SPEAKER_11]: I thought Duke Nukem Forever was cancelled, finally.

1378
01:46:36,958 --> 01:46:39,341
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know if we ever get the final word on that or not.

1379
01:46:39,361 --> 01:46:45,566
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it's still in limbo because somebody could technically still take the code because wouldn't the publisher now own the code?

1380
01:46:45,586 --> 01:46:46,467
[SPEAKER_11]: That's true, that's true.

1381
01:46:46,687 --> 01:46:49,710
[SPEAKER_11]: And get somebody else to finish it and call it a done deal?

1382
01:46:50,150 --> 01:46:50,591
[SPEAKER_11]: It could happen.

1383
01:46:51,432 --> 01:46:51,812
[SPEAKER_11]: It could happen.

1384
01:46:52,779 --> 01:46:56,400
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, we're going to take some time now to bring up your emails.

1385
01:46:56,800 --> 01:47:01,682
[SPEAKER_11]: Every week we let you guys send us emails at mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com and we respond to them live on air.

1386
01:47:02,082 --> 01:47:03,803
[SPEAKER_11]: In fact, that's what we're going to do right now.

1387
01:47:10,505 --> 01:47:11,405
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, take it away.

1388
01:47:12,826 --> 01:47:14,366
[SPEAKER_01]: AlphaKananagram must have been bored.

1389
01:47:14,887 --> 01:47:17,407
[SPEAKER_01]: We got an email with the title, You Suck.

1390
01:47:18,488 --> 01:47:21,429
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the inside, it says, I love Puyo Puyo Wee.

1391
01:47:23,547 --> 01:47:24,908
[SPEAKER_11]: Don't drink and... Is Puyo Puyo on the Wii?

1392
01:47:25,669 --> 01:47:25,869
[SPEAKER_01]: No.

1393
01:47:26,229 --> 01:47:27,110
[SPEAKER_01]: Wii.

1394
01:47:27,530 --> 01:47:29,211
[SPEAKER_01]: When you refer to yourself and other people.

1395
01:47:29,772 --> 01:47:30,332
[SPEAKER_10]: I know, I get it.

1396
01:47:30,612 --> 01:47:38,498
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, from MisoSky, we have, Hey, I have been noticing that the majority of MMORPGs are either science fiction or medieval fantasy.

1397
01:47:38,518 --> 01:47:43,382
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you ever think we will see MMORPGs that are westerns, 1980s, or even modern era?

1398
01:47:43,402 --> 01:47:44,262
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude, we have.

1399
01:47:44,402 --> 01:47:45,063
[SPEAKER_01]: There was Matrix.

1400
01:47:46,004 --> 01:47:48,485
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think that people are attracted... That's sort of sci-fi.

1401
01:47:48,565 --> 01:47:51,568
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that is more sci-fi, but you were in a modern environment.

1402
01:47:52,128 --> 01:47:57,173
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think people are attracted to an MMORPG that has been done countless times before?

1403
01:48:00,096 --> 01:48:02,798
[SPEAKER_01]: There actually are pirate-based MMOs.

1404
01:48:03,098 --> 01:48:04,800
[SPEAKER_01]: Puzzle Pirates?

1405
01:48:05,521 --> 01:48:10,525
[SPEAKER_01]: No, there actually was one that I played a little bit of at PAX last year.

1406
01:48:11,767 --> 01:48:14,189
[SPEAKER_01]: Where you could play a pirate and raid for booty.

1407
01:48:16,958 --> 01:48:21,522
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, what about, did they mention, like, you know, Star Trek has an MMO coming out?

1408
01:48:21,542 --> 01:48:22,443
[SPEAKER_11]: Science Fiction.

1409
01:48:22,523 --> 01:48:22,943
[SPEAKER_11]: Or Eve.

1410
01:48:23,084 --> 01:48:23,904
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, it's Science Fiction.

1411
01:48:24,785 --> 01:48:26,467
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, Science Fiction or Medieval Fantasy.

1412
01:48:26,487 --> 01:48:27,948
[SPEAKER_11]: Something else outside the box.

1413
01:48:28,128 --> 01:48:28,809
[SPEAKER_01]: Anything Western?

1414
01:48:28,829 --> 01:48:34,133
[SPEAKER_11]: Disney has a couple MMOs out there, based on their products, but they're a little...

1415
01:48:35,154 --> 01:48:38,396
[SPEAKER_10]: You know Disney stars are genetically engineered in a lab, right?

1416
01:48:38,777 --> 01:48:40,037
[SPEAKER_10]: Isn't there a Pirates of the Caribbean?

1417
01:48:40,358 --> 01:48:40,798
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, there is.

1418
01:48:41,138 --> 01:48:44,620
[SPEAKER_11]: But the thing about those games, you can't type text in them.

1419
01:48:45,161 --> 01:48:49,504
[SPEAKER_11]: You have predetermined phrases that you can say because obviously they have to keep it family safe.

1420
01:48:49,944 --> 01:48:55,187
[SPEAKER_11]: So you don't have mean people in there typing fuck, shit, piss, cock unless that is a preselected phrase.

1421
01:48:55,208 --> 01:48:56,829
[SPEAKER_11]: They also have all the adult MMOs.

1422
01:48:57,549 --> 01:48:57,930
[SPEAKER_11]: That's true.

1423
01:48:57,970 --> 01:48:59,411
[SPEAKER_11]: You can always try to find an adult MMO.

1424
01:48:59,451 --> 01:49:00,813
[SPEAKER_01]: Like the Red Light District one?

1425
01:49:01,233 --> 01:49:02,475
[SPEAKER_11]: You're going to have to face it.

1426
01:49:02,495 --> 01:49:05,898
[SPEAKER_11]: The fantasy and sci-fi ones are by far the most popular, at least right now.

1427
01:49:06,439 --> 01:49:06,579
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.

1428
01:49:07,160 --> 01:49:09,923
[SPEAKER_01]: Last one, and it comes from Maren.

1429
01:49:11,826 --> 01:49:12,466
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, ready?

1430
01:49:12,706 --> 01:49:13,026
[SPEAKER_01]: It's long.

1431
01:49:13,667 --> 01:49:18,708
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey guys, I didn't get to call in, but I wanted to touch on two subjects that were discussed during last week's episode.

1432
01:49:19,768 --> 01:49:24,450
[SPEAKER_01]: First, Rob mentioned that some people are complaining about how DJ Hero is just a ripoff of Beatmania 2DX.

1433
01:49:24,870 --> 01:49:27,711
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe that Rob protested the idea, saying they're completely different.

1434
01:49:28,231 --> 01:49:29,851
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd like to think it's something like this.

1435
01:49:29,991 --> 01:49:33,632
[SPEAKER_01]: DJ Hero is to Beatmania 2DX as Guitar Hero is to Guitar Freaks.

1436
01:49:34,473 --> 01:49:35,273
[SPEAKER_01]: You could very well...

1437
01:49:37,156 --> 01:49:46,496
[SPEAKER_01]: you could very well say that these two games Beatmania and Guitar Freaks are the original music games and that games like DJ and Guitar Hero are knockoffs but I think it's more than that

1438
01:49:47,625 --> 01:49:48,425
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for watching.

1439
01:49:48,466 --> 01:49:49,126
[SPEAKER_01]: See you next time.

1440
01:50:06,796 --> 01:50:12,280
[SPEAKER_01]: who play or have played Guitar Freaks but I only have one friend who hasn't played Guitar Hero or Rock Band.

1441
01:50:12,660 --> 01:50:18,704
[SPEAKER_01]: Perhaps DJ Hero is similar to Beatmania TDX but it will definitely be something that is more accessible to a Western audience.

1442
01:50:19,884 --> 01:50:31,712
[SPEAKER_01]: I for one am happy that DJ Hero is joining the ranks of other music games like Guitar Hero and Rock Band because the success of DJ Hero will only bring us that much closer to having an Americanized keyboard mania game.

1443
01:50:32,032 --> 01:50:35,655
[SPEAKER_01]: And I personally will be the first person to stand in line to pre-order Piano Hero Elton John.

1444
01:50:36,695 --> 01:50:36,955
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

1445
01:50:37,136 --> 01:50:37,876
[SPEAKER_01]: Who's surprised?

1446
01:50:38,737 --> 01:50:49,064
[SPEAKER_12]: I would say the better comparison I think would be Guitar Freaks and Guitar Hero and then probably Beat Mania and Kraken DJ.

1447
01:50:50,384 --> 01:50:58,087
[SPEAKER_12]: because, you know, Kraken DJ, it's kind of a beat-matching game, but it's very different than Beatmania.

1448
01:50:58,387 --> 01:51:00,748
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I have my own thoughts, but let me wait until the email's done.

1449
01:51:01,468 --> 01:51:06,930
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, also, I did just get a note in saying that AlphaKananagram says that wasn't him, but an imposter.

1450
01:51:07,591 --> 01:51:07,951
[SPEAKER_01]: Whatever.

1451
01:51:08,211 --> 01:51:08,711
[SPEAKER_11]: Whatever.

1452
01:51:09,851 --> 01:51:10,072
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

1453
01:51:13,110 --> 01:51:14,851
[SPEAKER_01]: I honestly, I don't really care, I thought it was funny.

1454
01:51:16,212 --> 01:51:20,735
[SPEAKER_01]: Finally, I just wanted to touch on the idea of the new PS3 remote.

1455
01:51:21,336 --> 01:51:27,920
[SPEAKER_01]: To make a long story short, the idea of the PS3 remote makes me think of the SuperScope 6, pretty nifty idea in theory, complete fail in execution.

1456
01:51:28,641 --> 01:51:30,362
[SPEAKER_01]: Take care and have fun gaming, Marin.

1457
01:51:30,442 --> 01:51:30,702
[SPEAKER_01]: P.S.

1458
01:51:30,722 --> 01:51:33,964
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, if you come to Las Vegas from July 1st through 7th, I will give you a dollar.

1459
01:51:34,285 --> 01:51:34,965
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, guess what?

1460
01:51:35,405 --> 01:51:37,407
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to Las Vegas from July 1st through the 7th.

1461
01:51:38,925 --> 01:51:39,645
[SPEAKER_11]: You win a dollar.

1462
01:51:39,906 --> 01:51:40,186
[SPEAKER_11]: Congrats.

1463
01:51:40,206 --> 01:51:41,687
[SPEAKER_01]: How about buy me a soda?

1464
01:51:42,547 --> 01:51:44,728
[SPEAKER_11]: You should put that dollar in a slot machine and win a hundred.

1465
01:51:45,009 --> 01:51:46,309
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't gamble.

1466
01:51:46,369 --> 01:51:47,110
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to play bimbo.

1467
01:51:47,350 --> 01:51:49,651
[SPEAKER_11]: I agree with some of the email and I disagree with some of it.

1468
01:51:50,172 --> 01:51:53,573
[SPEAKER_11]: I agree with the fact that Harmonix has done great things for music games over here.

1469
01:51:53,954 --> 01:51:57,136
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's not forget they did create the original Guitar Hero as well as Rock Band.

1470
01:51:57,476 --> 01:52:00,377
[SPEAKER_11]: Harmonix rocks.

1471
01:52:00,457 --> 01:52:02,899
[SPEAKER_11]: They did what Konami was too pussy to do, basically.

1472
01:52:03,519 --> 01:52:06,721
[SPEAKER_11]: For that, they deserve to be commended and get praise lavished upon them.

1473
01:52:06,761 --> 01:52:07,041
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1474
01:52:09,522 --> 01:52:12,304
[SPEAKER_11]: From a music game fan like myself, you have to understand.

1475
01:52:12,904 --> 01:52:13,344
[SPEAKER_11]: There you go.

1476
01:52:13,684 --> 01:52:18,246
[SPEAKER_11]: However, the part I disagree with is the comparison about DJ Hero and the Guitar Freaks, Guitar Hero thing.

1477
01:52:18,966 --> 01:52:22,228
[SPEAKER_11]: I get that, and here's the thing.

1478
01:52:22,648 --> 01:52:30,311
[SPEAKER_11]: I bet that's the same thing we're going to hear on G4 and for a lot of these networks and stuff, but I don't think it's a real good comparison.

1479
01:52:31,031 --> 01:52:37,854
[SPEAKER_11]: I would use the Guitar Hero, Guitar Freaks comparison in trying to describe DDR and In the Groove maybe a little bit.

1480
01:52:38,382 --> 01:52:45,686
[SPEAKER_11]: Although, you know, both games were guitars where you held down buttons and strummed the thing in time with it.

1481
01:52:46,206 --> 01:52:55,991
[SPEAKER_11]: The thing that's different for me is that that's not really what's happening with DJ Hero is that because you not only have the buttons, but you have the scratching and the crossfader is really big as well.

1482
01:52:56,531 --> 01:53:05,516
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's different than it is in 2DX because the whole crossfading leads to a style of gameplay that to me looks more like amplitude in a way.

1483
01:53:06,016 --> 01:53:11,458
[SPEAKER_12]: 2DX was more where the scratching was just a replacement of another button, basically.

1484
01:53:11,698 --> 01:53:12,338
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, exactly.

1485
01:53:12,758 --> 01:53:22,482
[SPEAKER_11]: And for me, 2DX just feels like it's just DDR but using buttons instead of your feet, which is ironic because Beatmania came before DDR, but that's really what it is.

1486
01:53:22,722 --> 01:53:25,603
[SPEAKER_11]: It's another way of reading music, in a way.

1487
01:53:26,003 --> 01:53:31,305
[SPEAKER_11]: I think a better comparison would be to say Street Fighter 2 versus Tekken.

1488
01:53:32,318 --> 01:53:35,881
[SPEAKER_11]: They're both fighting games, but they're completely different characters.

1489
01:53:36,281 --> 01:53:36,822
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, exactly.

1490
01:53:37,402 --> 01:53:37,943
[SPEAKER_11]: That's what I'm saying.

1491
01:53:38,523 --> 01:53:40,885
[SPEAKER_11]: DJ Hero and Beat Me at 2DX, they're both music games.

1492
01:53:40,905 --> 01:53:44,508
[SPEAKER_11]: They both involve turntables, but they're really different.

1493
01:53:44,648 --> 01:53:46,430
[SPEAKER_01]: They're just like Kraken DJ.

1494
01:53:46,630 --> 01:53:50,633
[SPEAKER_12]: When games started coming out and stuff, more fighting games, everyone was like, oh, it's a Street Fighter ripoff.

1495
01:53:51,174 --> 01:53:56,918
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think we're going to kind of go through this phase right now with Guitar Hero and these music games because everyone's going to say, oh, it's a ripoff.

1496
01:53:57,019 --> 01:53:58,520
[SPEAKER_12]: But really, it's just another music game.

1497
01:53:59,482 --> 01:54:06,685
[SPEAKER_11]: But, I mean, we got into it elsewhere on the show, though, as well, is that, you know, now they're charging a premium price for it, and I think that's going to be a little bit damaging.

1498
01:54:07,345 --> 01:54:11,887
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's also not forget, though, one thing that is interesting is that DJ Hero is not being made by Harmonix.

1499
01:54:12,267 --> 01:54:13,268
[SPEAKER_11]: Something to kind of keep in mind.

1500
01:54:13,428 --> 01:54:15,549
[SPEAKER_11]: Harmonix is not making DJ Hero.

1501
01:54:15,869 --> 01:54:20,211
[SPEAKER_11]: But that's kind of cool that other developers now, it's not just Harmonix has to make all our music games.

1502
01:54:20,331 --> 01:54:24,773
[SPEAKER_12]: But they, yeah, another developer, you know, is the one that did, you know, was...

1503
01:54:25,993 --> 01:54:32,618
[SPEAKER_12]: B-Boy, they did that game, which is another sort of music rhythm game with dancing involved and stuff like that.

1504
01:54:32,838 --> 01:54:38,983
[SPEAKER_12]: But they kind of have that whole style that they kind of brought with them and stuff and their influences with that.

1505
01:54:39,683 --> 01:54:40,004
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know.

1506
01:54:40,024 --> 01:54:40,704
[SPEAKER_12]: I think it looks cool.

1507
01:54:41,104 --> 01:54:41,885
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm willing to check it out.

1508
01:54:42,305 --> 01:54:50,388
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you might have missed a point, too, is that she wasn't saying that DJ Hero is like 2DX.

1509
01:54:51,288 --> 01:54:56,590
[SPEAKER_01]: It pertains to 2DX in the way that Guitar Hero pertained to Guitar Freaks.

1510
01:54:57,711 --> 01:55:04,793
[SPEAKER_01]: Not that they're the same type of game, but they're different.

1511
01:55:05,594 --> 01:55:09,015
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the Americanized improved version, basically.

1512
01:55:10,620 --> 01:55:13,822
[SPEAKER_01]: It's tailored to a different audience and newer.

1513
01:55:14,483 --> 01:55:16,204
[SPEAKER_11]: I can see that to a point.

1514
01:55:16,664 --> 01:55:21,768
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just so different than it felt when we were talking about Guitar Hero or Guitar Freeze.

1515
01:55:21,788 --> 01:55:26,992
[SPEAKER_11]: Because I think when a lot of us looked at Guitar Hero the first time, a lot of us jumped to that whole, oh, it's Guitar Freeze.

1516
01:55:27,472 --> 01:55:31,655
[SPEAKER_11]: But now that we're seeing DJ Hero, I don't see 2DX at all.

1517
01:55:32,276 --> 01:55:35,298
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just that the basic influence is there.

1518
01:55:37,892 --> 01:55:39,253
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1519
01:56:03,669 --> 01:56:06,530
[SPEAKER_11]: Showing the Guitar Hero a game like that would be popular in the first place.

1520
01:56:07,051 --> 01:56:08,531
[SPEAKER_11]: So, there you go.

1521
01:56:09,772 --> 01:56:12,693
[SPEAKER_11]: So, does that do it for the Mailbag?

1522
01:56:13,653 --> 01:56:14,854
[SPEAKER_01]: That be it, sir.

1523
01:56:15,154 --> 01:56:15,314
[SPEAKER_01]: Arr.

1524
01:56:15,614 --> 01:56:15,895
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

1525
01:56:15,935 --> 01:56:20,817
[SPEAKER_11]: If you want to send us more emails, Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com is the place to send your emails.

1526
01:56:21,137 --> 01:56:23,118
[SPEAKER_11]: We do have a segment here every week where we read those.

1527
01:56:24,038 --> 01:56:26,299
[SPEAKER_11]: Also, we do some interactive stuff through our Twitter.

1528
01:56:26,359 --> 01:56:30,161
[SPEAKER_11]: So, if you don't have us added on Twitter yet, you should do that at Twitter.com slash OLR.

1529
01:56:30,540 --> 01:56:31,480
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1530
01:56:54,249 --> 01:56:59,974
[SPEAKER_12]: with Netflix on the Xbox 360 plus Microsoft's own video service.

1531
01:57:01,015 --> 01:57:06,680
[SPEAKER_12]: Same thing with the PlayStation Network where you can stream movies as well.

1532
01:57:07,260 --> 01:57:20,451
[SPEAKER_12]: Actually, apparently Instat, a marketing analysis group, published a report this week basically examining how this web-to-TV streaming is consumed by people out there.

1533
01:57:21,091 --> 01:57:25,517
[SPEAKER_12]: and they found that the majority of it is coming actually from console owners.

1534
01:57:26,518 --> 01:57:28,200
[SPEAKER_12]: They said 29% of U.S.

1535
01:57:28,260 --> 01:57:34,727
[SPEAKER_12]: console owners between the ages of 25 and 34 currently use their consoles to stream video to their televisions.

1536
01:57:35,809 --> 01:57:36,710
[SPEAKER_12]: And yeah, I can see that.

1537
01:57:36,770 --> 01:57:40,995
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, I use it for streaming...

1538
01:57:41,966 --> 01:57:45,348
[SPEAKER_12]: Video, and files and stuff like that.

1539
01:57:45,368 --> 01:57:49,151
[SPEAKER_12]: Plus, I've also downloaded TV episodes and stuff like that on there.

1540
01:57:49,251 --> 01:57:50,592
[SPEAKER_12]: So, it is popular.

1541
01:57:50,612 --> 01:57:51,413
[SPEAKER_11]: It's convenient.

1542
01:57:51,533 --> 01:57:52,353
[SPEAKER_11]: Here's my question.

1543
01:57:52,433 --> 01:57:55,055
[SPEAKER_11]: What's the competition besides game consoles?

1544
01:57:55,175 --> 01:57:55,776
[SPEAKER_11]: Apple TV?

1545
01:57:56,116 --> 01:57:57,137
[SPEAKER_11]: Are they comparing it to Apple TV?

1546
01:57:57,157 --> 01:58:04,302
[SPEAKER_11]: Or are they comparing it to these Netflix boxes that you can buy that are just standalone Netflix devices that I've heard of?

1547
01:58:04,642 --> 01:58:13,727
[SPEAKER_12]: Digital media adapters, set-top boxes like Apple TV, Blu-ray players, web-connected HD TVs, and I guess media center PCs.

1548
01:58:15,097 --> 01:58:17,638
[SPEAKER_12]: That's odd that they throw Blu-ray players into that.

1549
01:58:17,738 --> 01:58:17,998
[SPEAKER_12]: What?

1550
01:58:18,598 --> 01:58:20,519
[SPEAKER_12]: I guess web-enabled stuff.

1551
01:58:20,539 --> 01:58:24,841
[SPEAKER_12]: Maybe they're talking about how you can get those bonuses on Blu-rays.

1552
01:58:24,861 --> 01:58:30,022
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, yeah, like you can go into the BD Live and get all the user commentary and all that stuff.

1553
01:58:30,082 --> 01:58:30,743
[SPEAKER_11]: I can't figure out.

1554
01:58:30,963 --> 01:58:33,104
[SPEAKER_11]: That's too complicated for a normal person to use.

1555
01:58:33,244 --> 01:58:33,664
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sorry.

1556
01:58:34,004 --> 01:58:37,225
[SPEAKER_11]: But that BD Live stuff with doing all the custom commentary stuff, too complicated.

1557
01:58:37,585 --> 01:58:39,786
[SPEAKER_11]: If they want people to actually use that, they need to make it more...

1558
01:58:41,386 --> 01:58:41,926
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks for watching!

1559
01:59:04,434 --> 01:59:05,554
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1560
01:59:29,821 --> 01:59:56,330
[SPEAKER_11]: WALL-E but it's not really a chat room they don't show messages or anything like that because you know somebody would just be on there typing penis penis penis the whole time but what they do they do these weird like polls like a little thing will pop up on the screen like press this button if you saw WALL-E in the theater or press this button if you didn't see it until it came out on blu-ray or whatever and like people vote and it shows you the results these weird little interactive things that I think just need some time to be good

1561
01:59:57,430 --> 01:59:57,870
[SPEAKER_11]: It's neat.

1562
01:59:57,930 --> 02:00:00,012
[SPEAKER_11]: I kind of looked at it going, that's kind of a neat feature.

1563
02:00:00,032 --> 02:00:01,673
[SPEAKER_11]: I wish they could do something more useful with it.

1564
02:00:02,513 --> 02:00:04,335
[SPEAKER_12]: Here's what I think would be pretty cool.

1565
02:00:04,375 --> 02:00:08,397
[SPEAKER_12]: As you know how with Blu-ray and stuff you can do full Java programming with it.

1566
02:00:09,938 --> 02:00:13,721
[SPEAKER_12]: Interactive board games or TV show things like that.

1567
02:00:13,761 --> 02:00:17,063
[SPEAKER_12]: Trivia games I think would be pretty cool because you could actually program that stuff in there.

1568
02:00:17,944 --> 02:00:24,168
[SPEAKER_12]: And you know how before with a DVD you'd have some sort of crazy menu system and paths and stuff that would go for that.

1569
02:00:24,268 --> 02:00:25,969
[SPEAKER_12]: You could actually program a pretty decent game.

1570
02:00:27,405 --> 02:00:29,687
[SPEAKER_11]: TigerClaw on chat says, the BD Live stuff is cool.

1571
02:00:29,727 --> 02:00:32,589
[SPEAKER_11]: My only gripe is the video extras they offer aren't full screen.

1572
02:00:34,531 --> 02:00:37,313
[SPEAKER_11]: I see I've yet to even really figure out how to get the video extras.

1573
02:00:37,513 --> 02:00:38,034
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know what DVD...

1574
02:00:43,592 --> 02:00:44,253
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1575
02:01:02,288 --> 02:01:03,029
[SPEAKER_12]: Thanks for watching!

1576
02:01:18,177 --> 02:01:18,577
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura.com

1577
02:01:46,398 --> 02:01:56,143
[SPEAKER_11]: and I'm being told the Transformers Blu-ray has new BD Live content featuring footage from the new Transformers movie plus some deleted scenes from the first one that just went released this week.

1578
02:01:56,844 --> 02:02:00,366
[SPEAKER_11]: Well that would explain why I don't have it because I don't have the Transformers Blu-ray.

1579
02:02:01,326 --> 02:02:02,447
[SPEAKER_11]: I thought about the Transformers Blu-ray.

1580
02:02:02,467 --> 02:02:02,927
[SPEAKER_01]: I got it on HD.

1581
02:02:03,788 --> 02:02:05,368
[SPEAKER_11]: Ah, there you go.

1582
02:02:05,448 --> 02:02:07,109
[SPEAKER_11]: We all got screwed for that so there you go.

1583
02:02:09,773 --> 02:02:11,454
[SPEAKER_11]: SSJ100 Matt makes an interesting comment in chat.

1584
02:02:11,534 --> 02:02:14,495
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm buying a Blu-ray player for my dad for his birthday this week.

1585
02:02:14,855 --> 02:02:16,455
[SPEAKER_11]: I really don't see why he would want any of this.

1586
02:02:16,535 --> 02:02:18,416
[SPEAKER_11]: Besides, I don't feel like showing him how to use it.

1587
02:02:19,557 --> 02:02:22,598
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, honestly, I have my Blu-ray player on PS3.

1588
02:02:23,138 --> 02:02:24,678
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't use any of this extra content.

1589
02:02:24,858 --> 02:02:30,821
[SPEAKER_12]: In fact, I could care less about these interactive things where I can go on and chat with the producers and stuff.

1590
02:02:31,321 --> 02:02:31,641
[SPEAKER_12]: Who cares?

1591
02:02:31,741 --> 02:02:32,861
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a damn DVD.

1592
02:02:32,921 --> 02:02:36,543
[SPEAKER_12]: If I want to chat with producers and stuff, I'll go on the internet.

1593
02:02:36,583 --> 02:02:37,223
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a Blu-ray.

1594
02:02:38,598 --> 02:02:40,039
[SPEAKER_12]: Blu-ray, DVD, or whatever.

1595
02:02:40,119 --> 02:02:40,700
[SPEAKER_12]: It doesn't matter.

1596
02:02:40,840 --> 02:02:51,469
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm looking for basically the same content that's on a DVD, but maybe in a higher resolution or more content added on there instead of having to have four discs or something like that.

1597
02:02:52,930 --> 02:02:54,691
[SPEAKER_12]: Just all on one disc.

1598
02:02:55,492 --> 02:02:56,032
[SPEAKER_12]: Would be nice.

1599
02:02:57,073 --> 02:02:58,554
[SPEAKER_11]: Back to the original part of the story.

1600
02:02:58,915 --> 02:03:00,456
[SPEAKER_11]: The whole Netflix thing.

1601
02:03:02,638 --> 02:03:02,818
[SPEAKER_11]: What...

1602
02:03:03,939 --> 02:03:07,141
[SPEAKER_11]: What is the central part of this?

1603
02:03:07,361 --> 02:03:19,350
[SPEAKER_11]: Are they trying to say that this is just showing that game devices are actually becoming entertainment hubs and all these other types of things that will only do entertainment are being rejected?

1604
02:03:19,370 --> 02:03:27,175
[SPEAKER_12]: I think they're surprised that for something that's streaming from the web that the consoles...

1605
02:03:28,860 --> 02:03:40,586
[SPEAKER_12]: I guess they're saying basically that video to television streaming is putting pressure on traditional cable providers and will eventually restructure today's video distribution ecosystem.

1606
02:03:41,367 --> 02:03:45,149
[SPEAKER_12]: And they're saying that game consoles are at the forefront of this new direction.

1607
02:03:45,589 --> 02:03:46,710
[SPEAKER_12]: So basically they're saying...

1608
02:03:48,019 --> 02:04:02,864
[SPEAKER_12]: eventually everything is going to go the kind of digital streaming that physical media is going to go away or at least that's what they're claiming and that leading the way of this transition is game consoles hmm

1609
02:04:04,482 --> 02:04:05,382
[SPEAKER_11]: That sounds pretty cool.

1610
02:04:05,622 --> 02:04:06,883
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm looking at some comments from chat.

1611
02:04:08,083 --> 02:04:10,444
[SPEAKER_11]: TigerClaw talks about the particular Blu-ray player he has.

1612
02:04:10,864 --> 02:04:14,245
[SPEAKER_11]: I have a Sony BDP-S350 which supports BD Live.

1613
02:04:14,265 --> 02:04:17,826
[SPEAKER_11]: The BD Live only works on it as long as you have a USB thumb drive connected on the back.

1614
02:04:18,146 --> 02:04:20,526
[SPEAKER_11]: I wonder how many people would even think to do that.

1615
02:04:21,607 --> 02:04:24,087
[SPEAKER_11]: There's so many people that just need it to work right out of the box.

1616
02:04:24,688 --> 02:04:30,709
[SPEAKER_11]: TheRobD says, I don't know when the last time I listened to a director commentary was, but TigerClaw follows that up with, I love listening to director's commentary.

1617
02:04:31,029 --> 02:04:32,770
[SPEAKER_11]: So I guess it really depends on the person.

1618
02:04:33,670 --> 02:04:37,856
[SPEAKER_11]: So, kind of interesting.

1619
02:04:37,996 --> 02:04:39,658
[SPEAKER_11]: SSJ100Matt closes this thought.

1620
02:04:39,758 --> 02:04:41,060
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a gimmick, is what it is.

1621
02:04:42,190 --> 02:04:49,035
[SPEAKER_11]: Interesting story on Netflix kind of turned into this whole Blu-ray discussion, but I think that Blu-ray thing is something that will continue to evolve.

1622
02:04:49,455 --> 02:04:52,298
[SPEAKER_11]: I think the smart thing that has been built into it is funny.

1623
02:04:52,358 --> 02:04:55,100
[SPEAKER_11]: It's something I was critical of Sony on earlier.

1624
02:04:55,680 --> 02:05:04,967
[SPEAKER_11]: I was critical on Sony about this, and that is that Sony does not manage to evolve usually, and that's why Microsoft's beating them.

1625
02:05:05,487 --> 02:05:05,687
[SPEAKER_11]: But...

1626
02:05:06,588 --> 02:05:09,650
[SPEAKER_11]: Now it appears they are evolving in where it comes to Blu-ray.

1627
02:05:09,830 --> 02:05:13,193
[SPEAKER_12]: For more updates, that's what it comes down to.

1628
02:05:13,813 --> 02:05:17,055
[SPEAKER_12]: Now you can create a new feature and everybody can now have that feature.

1629
02:05:19,585 --> 02:05:25,067
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, well, let's move on to another topic and talk a little bit about something else that's going on on the PlayStation 3 right now.

1630
02:05:25,607 --> 02:05:30,469
[SPEAKER_11]: It was a hamster versus human dance-off in PlayStation Home.

1631
02:05:31,009 --> 02:05:32,190
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, you heard me right.

1632
02:05:32,410 --> 02:05:37,692
[SPEAKER_11]: This Saturday, this past Saturday, there was a hamsters versus humans dance-off that happened.

1633
02:05:38,532 --> 02:05:48,576
[SPEAKER_11]: I just want to point out, it's not April 1st, it is the middle of June, and I don't know what the hell this was for, although apparently...

1634
02:05:49,036 --> 02:05:50,537
[SPEAKER_11]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1635
02:06:13,836 --> 02:06:16,418
[SPEAKER_11]: And some of them look like furries because they're hamsters.

1636
02:06:19,141 --> 02:06:24,085
[SPEAKER_12]: I think the most important information that we got out of this is that there's hamster costumes in home.

1637
02:06:24,785 --> 02:06:27,247
[SPEAKER_12]: And that's scary now because now there's furries in home.

1638
02:06:27,968 --> 02:06:37,916
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I think my initial reaction when I watched this video and kind of everything that's going on here is, What the fucking fuck is this fucking bullfuck fuck?

1639
02:06:37,936 --> 02:06:38,376
[SPEAKER_11]: Woo!

1640
02:06:38,880 --> 02:06:39,741
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, really?

1641
02:06:40,201 --> 02:06:41,162
[SPEAKER_11]: What is this?

1642
02:06:41,682 --> 02:06:49,548
[SPEAKER_11]: Is this what we imagined PlayStation Home was going to be when they unveiled it at Gamer Developers Conference last year?

1643
02:06:50,049 --> 02:06:53,351
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, is this the innovation that they were looking forward to do in Home?

1644
02:06:53,831 --> 02:06:54,172
[SPEAKER_11]: Really?

1645
02:06:54,892 --> 02:06:56,433
[SPEAKER_11]: This is just Second Life, okay?

1646
02:06:56,453 --> 02:06:58,815
[SPEAKER_11]: This is the kind of crap that happens in Second Life.

1647
02:06:59,055 --> 02:07:03,319
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not that I have a problem with the stupidity of the whole thing...

1648
02:07:03,999 --> 02:07:07,720
[SPEAKER_11]: But it was on the official Sony PlayStation blog.

1649
02:07:08,240 --> 02:07:09,820
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'm just kind of like, really?

1650
02:07:10,180 --> 02:07:12,601
[SPEAKER_11]: These are the events I have to look forward to at home?

1651
02:07:13,081 --> 02:07:14,441
[SPEAKER_11]: What is the fucking point?

1652
02:07:15,381 --> 02:07:17,342
[SPEAKER_11]: Really?

1653
02:07:17,462 --> 02:07:24,003
[SPEAKER_11]: Home being used to broadcast the Sony PlayStation conference during E3?

1654
02:07:24,423 --> 02:07:26,144
[SPEAKER_11]: That was a great use of home.

1655
02:07:26,464 --> 02:07:27,324
[SPEAKER_11]: That was smart.

1656
02:07:27,364 --> 02:07:28,144
[SPEAKER_11]: That was cool.

1657
02:07:28,604 --> 02:07:30,685
[SPEAKER_11]: And having everybody in that one place, they could view it.

1658
02:07:31,065 --> 02:07:32,405
[SPEAKER_11]: Hamsters vs. Humans...

1659
02:07:34,068 --> 02:07:38,985
[SPEAKER_12]: and it doesn't look like there was a good turnout for that either I mean it's just like maybe 50 people

1660
02:07:42,051 --> 02:07:44,092
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, apparently it was server by server, too.

1661
02:07:44,932 --> 02:07:45,493
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, awesome.

1662
02:07:45,513 --> 02:07:46,473
[SPEAKER_11]: You know what, though?

1663
02:07:46,793 --> 02:07:48,674
[SPEAKER_11]: You log into home, there's a lot of people using it.

1664
02:07:48,794 --> 02:07:50,095
[SPEAKER_11]: I just don't know what they're doing.

1665
02:07:50,435 --> 02:07:51,635
[SPEAKER_11]: I have yet to figure that out.

1666
02:07:52,015 --> 02:07:54,556
[SPEAKER_11]: Waiting in lines for games?

1667
02:07:54,597 --> 02:07:57,558
[SPEAKER_12]: Why do you have to wait in line to play a game?

1668
02:07:57,638 --> 02:07:59,779
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a fucking virtual world.

1669
02:07:59,879 --> 02:08:02,600
[SPEAKER_12]: You can play the game whenever the hell you want.

1670
02:08:02,660 --> 02:08:05,141
[SPEAKER_12]: Why do I have to wait in line to play a virtual game?

1671
02:08:05,441 --> 02:08:06,462
[SPEAKER_11]: That's stupid.

1672
02:08:07,943 --> 02:08:12,884
[SPEAKER_11]: TigerClaw says home is also being used for Q&As with the directors and stars of big movies.

1673
02:08:13,324 --> 02:08:15,205
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, that's neat, I guess.

1674
02:08:17,405 --> 02:08:20,166
[SPEAKER_11]: A little unnecessary, but I guess they do it in Second Life, too.

1675
02:08:21,026 --> 02:08:26,127
[SPEAKER_11]: It's something more special than a chat room because you can actually see the director or the special person in front of you.

1676
02:08:26,147 --> 02:08:29,488
[SPEAKER_12]: And do the running man as a hamster.

1677
02:08:30,768 --> 02:08:33,969
[SPEAKER_11]: Or guinea pig, or whatever the hell.

1678
02:08:34,029 --> 02:08:34,109
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

1679
02:08:34,129 --> 02:08:36,230
[SPEAKER_11]: SHM100Matt says, why couldn't Jack Trenton talk about this?

1680
02:08:36,410 --> 02:08:36,750
[SPEAKER_11]: LOL.

1681
02:08:38,155 --> 02:08:40,299
[SPEAKER_11]: Zappy says waiting in lines is very social

1682
02:08:52,912 --> 02:08:53,753
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

1683
02:08:53,813 --> 02:08:57,115
[SPEAKER_11]: It's hard for me to say because I don't know what types of things people say on home.

1684
02:08:57,135 --> 02:08:58,575
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't pay attention to a lot of the dialogue.

1685
02:08:58,896 --> 02:09:03,318
[SPEAKER_11]: But I can't imagine people are going to be as cordial online as they are in real life.

1686
02:09:03,978 --> 02:09:08,080
[SPEAKER_11]: When you're standing in line at Disneyland, maybe you'll strike up conversation with people around you.

1687
02:09:08,161 --> 02:09:08,521
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe.

1688
02:09:08,781 --> 02:09:09,101
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

1689
02:09:09,161 --> 02:09:11,822
[SPEAKER_11]: I usually don't because I strike up conversation with the people that are with me.

1690
02:09:12,183 --> 02:09:14,504
[SPEAKER_11]: But okay, we are being social because I'm with people.

1691
02:09:15,424 --> 02:09:35,087
[SPEAKER_11]: but A, in home you don't really have that everybody goes to home by themselves and B, when people can hide behind their monitors they do stupid shit that they wouldn't do in real life so I don't think people would say hurry the fuck up at Disneyland as much as they would say in Sony Home I don't know I say hurry the fuck up all the time at Disneyland

1692
02:09:36,547 --> 02:09:38,849
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, but you're not really saying it to a child.

1693
02:09:38,869 --> 02:09:39,529
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, maybe you are.

1694
02:09:39,589 --> 02:09:39,909
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

1695
02:09:40,390 --> 02:09:45,173
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, I just... What I wanted to tell some of the parents there is to watch your fucking children, maybe.

1696
02:09:46,614 --> 02:09:46,934
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

1697
02:09:46,954 --> 02:09:50,817
[SPEAKER_11]: Just when I saw this whole thing, granted, if I don't like it, I just shouldn't play it.

1698
02:09:50,857 --> 02:09:52,598
[SPEAKER_11]: But I'm just looking at this going, really?

1699
02:09:53,559 --> 02:09:53,799
[SPEAKER_11]: Really?

1700
02:09:53,839 --> 02:09:55,020
[SPEAKER_11]: This is what home has become?

1701
02:09:55,360 --> 02:10:00,304
[SPEAKER_12]: I can understand if it was some sort of thing that bloggers or whatever decided, hey, let's do this.

1702
02:10:00,344 --> 02:10:01,024
[SPEAKER_12]: This is funny.

1703
02:10:01,144 --> 02:10:03,326
[SPEAKER_11]: I wouldn't have even reported on it in that case.

1704
02:10:03,426 --> 02:10:04,987
[SPEAKER_11]: But it was on the official PlayStation blog.

1705
02:10:06,348 --> 02:10:09,489
[SPEAKER_11]: And with a little poster markup and everything.

1706
02:10:10,069 --> 02:10:14,530
[SPEAKER_11]: And I don't know if that's kind of like just giving in or conceding to what home has become.

1707
02:10:15,091 --> 02:10:21,533
[SPEAKER_11]: But if you want me to have this be, I turn on my PlayStation and the first thing I see is home.

1708
02:10:21,853 --> 02:10:25,834
[SPEAKER_11]: And then I walk up to this if I want to launch a game or I have my trophy case and all this stuff.

1709
02:10:26,194 --> 02:10:29,995
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, really, this is not the way to sell it to me that this is ever going to be a reality.

1710
02:10:30,015 --> 02:10:34,496
[SPEAKER_12]: You'll be able to launch in the home and view your trophy case coming 2010.

1711
02:10:38,835 --> 02:10:40,236
[SPEAKER_12]: It's on the horizon, Rob.

1712
02:10:40,256 --> 02:10:44,317
[SPEAKER_12]: You have to understand that the pure use of home, it's coming.

1713
02:10:45,497 --> 02:10:46,757
[SPEAKER_12]: It'll be there eventually.

1714
02:10:46,837 --> 02:10:51,218
[SPEAKER_12]: Don't worry, we'll have a firm launch date that we won't stick to, but it'll come.

1715
02:10:52,278 --> 02:10:52,978
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm so sorry.

1716
02:10:53,218 --> 02:10:54,939
[SPEAKER_11]: How could I ever doubt Sony?

1717
02:10:55,499 --> 02:10:58,260
[SPEAKER_11]: Especially after the amazing hardware that was the PlayStation 2.

1718
02:10:58,500 --> 02:10:58,960
[SPEAKER_11]: How dare I?

1719
02:10:59,980 --> 02:11:00,940
[SPEAKER_11]: How dare I be skeptical?

1720
02:11:02,980 --> 02:11:04,721
[SPEAKER_11]: All I have to say is bring on the games.

1721
02:11:06,822 --> 02:11:10,646
[SPEAKER_11]: Part of me thinks if I'd seen this earlier, I would have actually logged in to check it out.

1722
02:11:10,727 --> 02:11:13,830
[SPEAKER_11]: And then once I was there, I would have been like, what the hell am I doing with my life?

1723
02:11:14,451 --> 02:11:16,954
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, slash risk, slash risk.

1724
02:11:17,635 --> 02:11:18,656
[SPEAKER_11]: But, oh well.

1725
02:11:19,116 --> 02:11:20,358
[SPEAKER_11]: They need PvP at home.

1726
02:11:21,934 --> 02:11:24,135
[SPEAKER_11]: or just maybe a game somewhere in there.

1727
02:11:24,175 --> 02:11:24,575
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

1728
02:11:25,095 --> 02:11:25,696
[SPEAKER_11]: PvP.

1729
02:11:25,736 --> 02:11:26,936
[SPEAKER_11]: PvP would be better.

1730
02:11:27,696 --> 02:11:32,178
[SPEAKER_11]: It would be cool if I could actually walk up to somebody and it was very easy to start a game.

1731
02:11:32,498 --> 02:11:32,939
[SPEAKER_11]: But I don't know.

1732
02:11:32,999 --> 02:11:37,040
[SPEAKER_11]: At the same time, maybe finding my friends list in a home would be a place to start.

1733
02:11:37,680 --> 02:11:42,242
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe a section of home that only my friends list can access or friends of friends can access.

1734
02:11:42,682 --> 02:11:43,323
[SPEAKER_11]: I would love that.

1735
02:11:43,523 --> 02:11:48,505
[SPEAKER_11]: A section where I only see friends and friends of friends and then can start up really easy, quick games with them.

1736
02:11:49,181 --> 02:11:49,521
[SPEAKER_12]: DarkSakura.com

1737
02:12:09,929 --> 02:12:12,470
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, as a matter of fact, I do.

1738
02:12:13,070 --> 02:12:16,271
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is actually something that I think is really, really cool.

1739
02:12:17,391 --> 02:12:32,394
[SPEAKER_01]: Namco Museum Essentials is coming to PlayStation Home in July, which looks like we'll be getting Pac-Man, Galaga, Dig Dug, Dragon Spirit, Xevious, and a 1080p quote re-envisioned Xevious Resurrection, which is pretty cool.

1740
02:12:32,735 --> 02:12:35,615
[SPEAKER_01]: So you get your trophies, leaderboards, blah, blah, blah.

1741
02:12:35,675 --> 02:12:38,676
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's more Namco, and that's always happy.

1742
02:12:39,758 --> 02:12:41,879
[SPEAKER_11]: But the important thing to note about this is it's in home.

1743
02:12:42,220 --> 02:12:42,940
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, it's in home.

1744
02:12:43,200 --> 02:12:44,241
[SPEAKER_11]: That's strange.

1745
02:12:45,202 --> 02:12:46,342
[SPEAKER_11]: So am I going to have to buy this?

1746
02:12:46,743 --> 02:12:50,465
[SPEAKER_11]: Is home going to be the only place I can play this Xevious re-imaging?

1747
02:12:50,845 --> 02:12:52,186
[SPEAKER_01]: I doubt it for very long.

1748
02:12:52,306 --> 02:12:56,609
[SPEAKER_12]: So you buy the game and then you have to wait in line to play your own game that you just bought?

1749
02:12:56,629 --> 02:12:59,050
[SPEAKER_12]: Surely it can't be like that.

1750
02:12:59,070 --> 02:13:00,551
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe it goes in your own house.

1751
02:13:01,552 --> 02:13:02,373
[SPEAKER_11]: That would make sense.

1752
02:13:02,853 --> 02:13:04,814
[SPEAKER_11]: If you buy this game and it goes in the house you own.

1753
02:13:05,555 --> 02:13:06,615
[SPEAKER_12]: Can other friends play it?

1754
02:13:06,855 --> 02:13:07,816
[SPEAKER_12]: Or is it going to be sorry?

1755
02:13:07,836 --> 02:13:09,257
[SPEAKER_11]: You can invite friends in your home, can't you?

1756
02:13:09,693 --> 02:13:09,973
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

1757
02:13:10,774 --> 02:13:13,856
[SPEAKER_11]: But it's just so... Honestly, I have to be honest.

1758
02:13:14,056 --> 02:13:15,958
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't really know how to do that.

1759
02:13:16,158 --> 02:13:19,000
[SPEAKER_11]: One thing Sony could do is make this whole thing easier.

1760
02:13:20,541 --> 02:13:21,041
[SPEAKER_11]: You know what I mean?

1761
02:13:21,742 --> 02:13:21,942
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1762
02:13:22,202 --> 02:13:22,943
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, okay.

1763
02:13:23,843 --> 02:13:24,444
[SPEAKER_11]: Facebook.

1764
02:13:24,884 --> 02:13:25,464
[SPEAKER_11]: Bejeweled.

1765
02:13:26,105 --> 02:13:28,186
[SPEAKER_11]: Tons of people play Bejeweled on Facebook, right?

1766
02:13:28,206 --> 02:13:30,748
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know about your friends list, but on my friends list, tons of people play.

1767
02:13:31,489 --> 02:13:32,389
[SPEAKER_11]: You know why they all play?

1768
02:13:32,850 --> 02:13:34,031
[SPEAKER_11]: Because when one person plays...

1769
02:13:35,111 --> 02:13:36,011
[SPEAKER_11]: And they get a good score.

1770
02:13:36,291 --> 02:13:38,792
[SPEAKER_11]: They click a button and it publishes to their profile.

1771
02:13:39,192 --> 02:13:39,973
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm playing this game.

1772
02:13:40,033 --> 02:13:41,513
[SPEAKER_11]: Come play with me by clicking here.

1773
02:13:42,413 --> 02:13:43,314
[SPEAKER_11]: That's how easy it is.

1774
02:13:45,334 --> 02:13:49,876
[SPEAKER_11]: If they want home to be like this central place that everybody... It needs to be that easy.

1775
02:13:50,956 --> 02:13:54,558
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'm sure I have listeners that are like, Rob, all you have to do is open up the menu and da-da-da-da-da.

1776
02:13:54,598 --> 02:13:55,218
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm like, no, no, no.

1777
02:13:55,418 --> 02:13:56,338
[SPEAKER_11]: You're not hearing what I'm saying.

1778
02:13:56,998 --> 02:13:59,479
[SPEAKER_11]: It needs to be easier than that.

1779
02:14:01,180 --> 02:14:01,720
[SPEAKER_11]: If you want...

1780
02:14:03,272 --> 02:14:04,312
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you for watching.

1781
02:14:04,332 --> 02:14:04,973
[SPEAKER_11]: See you next time.

1782
02:14:25,023 --> 02:14:35,777
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know though, as far as the Namco thing goes, I guess that's pretty cool, but I guess this could be the start of where we really start to see now maybe the full intention of home?

1783
02:14:36,338 --> 02:14:37,139
[SPEAKER_11]: If you want to call it that?

1784
02:14:37,339 --> 02:14:37,659
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

1785
02:14:39,221 --> 02:14:40,563
[SPEAKER_12]: To cash in on stuff?

1786
02:14:41,024 --> 02:14:41,785
[SPEAKER_12]: Sounds good to me.

1787
02:14:43,359 --> 02:14:45,300
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know, I think this would be kind of cool.

1788
02:15:13,237 --> 02:15:14,598
[SPEAKER_12]: I really wanna play it, actually.

1789
02:15:14,618 --> 02:15:17,440
[SPEAKER_12]: I really, really wanna play it, because I love Xevious.

1790
02:15:36,989 --> 02:15:40,572
[SPEAKER_11]: Actdeft in our chatroom points out Yaris was free too, and we all know how that turned out.

1791
02:15:41,913 --> 02:15:42,814
[SPEAKER_11]: So, there you go.

1792
02:15:45,156 --> 02:15:46,817
[SPEAKER_11]: Marin in chat makes a very good point.

1793
02:15:46,937 --> 02:15:48,839
[SPEAKER_11]: Home in real life is where you're lazy.

1794
02:15:49,339 --> 02:15:51,741
[SPEAKER_11]: Home for PlayStation 3 should be lazy-friendly too.

1795
02:15:52,302 --> 02:15:53,222
[SPEAKER_11]: Exactly my point.

1796
02:15:54,383 --> 02:15:58,006
[SPEAKER_11]: And RPGKing7 says it has to be stupid-friendly.

1797
02:15:58,166 --> 02:15:58,487
[SPEAKER_11]: It does.

1798
02:15:59,167 --> 02:15:59,507
[SPEAKER_11]: It does.

1799
02:15:59,528 --> 02:16:00,068
[SPEAKER_11]: It does.

1800
02:16:01,649 --> 02:16:06,952
[SPEAKER_11]: If we want our parents and some of our friends who aren't as into gaming, you all know this.

1801
02:16:07,712 --> 02:16:12,836
[SPEAKER_11]: You all have a friend who thinks video games are kind of fun, but doesn't really play an awful lot of them.

1802
02:16:13,336 --> 02:16:18,139
[SPEAKER_11]: But they might own a next-gen system that they play Madden or a role-playing game on once in a while.

1803
02:16:18,159 --> 02:16:18,659
[SPEAKER_11]: You know what?

1804
02:16:19,019 --> 02:16:20,500
[SPEAKER_11]: They wouldn't know how to use a lot of this stuff.

1805
02:16:20,600 --> 02:16:22,681
[SPEAKER_12]: They need to take, I think, examples.

1806
02:16:23,382 --> 02:16:28,545
[SPEAKER_12]: What they need to do is kind of learn from MMOs and what people do in their downtime in MMOs.

1807
02:16:29,065 --> 02:16:36,112
[SPEAKER_12]: I think home should add fishing because there's plenty of fishing going on in Final Fantasy XI and you know what?

1808
02:16:36,172 --> 02:16:38,534
[SPEAKER_12]: That's something you can do by yourself and just kick back.

1809
02:16:38,735 --> 02:16:42,178
[SPEAKER_11]: Actually, what about something like item synthesis or professions?

1810
02:16:42,959 --> 02:16:45,901
[SPEAKER_11]: I know it sounds stupid but imagine if you could make your own shirts.

1811
02:16:46,582 --> 02:16:47,782
[SPEAKER_11]: and things within reason.

1812
02:16:47,802 --> 02:16:55,485
[SPEAKER_11]: Like I'm not saying put your own designs on it because everybody will walk around with a shirt saying fuck or topless mods that just pictures of boobs and things like that.

1813
02:16:56,085 --> 02:17:05,949
[SPEAKER_11]: But I'm saying like, you know, people could collect items in home and then build stuff and then maybe even like sell them for fake money.

1814
02:17:06,029 --> 02:17:06,369
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

1815
02:17:07,089 --> 02:17:09,790
[SPEAKER_11]: But then I'm turning home into an MMO and I guess that's not his intention.

1816
02:17:10,291 --> 02:17:11,331
[SPEAKER_11]: But all right.

1817
02:17:12,168 --> 02:17:13,629
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's move on to another topic.

1818
02:17:13,809 --> 02:17:16,590
[SPEAKER_11]: And we're going to get into some Listless for tonight.

1819
02:17:17,111 --> 02:17:20,552
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'm excited because we haven't done Listless in a long time here on the show.

1820
02:17:20,933 --> 02:17:22,633
[SPEAKER_11]: And I need to find the music, though.

1821
02:17:23,434 --> 02:17:23,894
[SPEAKER_11]: Shame on me.

1822
02:17:23,934 --> 02:17:25,275
[SPEAKER_11]: I didn't have the music queued up already.

1823
02:17:25,295 --> 02:17:27,356
[SPEAKER_11]: But we have music that goes with Listless.

1824
02:17:28,116 --> 02:17:29,877
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's a remake of a familiar tune.

1825
02:17:31,438 --> 02:17:31,918
[SPEAKER_11]: Ah, there we go.

1826
02:17:31,938 --> 02:17:32,999
[SPEAKER_11]: The theme music for Listless.

1827
02:17:35,282 --> 02:17:43,926
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, the way this works, folks, if you've never heard this segment before on Orange Lounge Radio, we've been doing it ever since the very beginning because this is a segment I used to do on my college radio show.

1828
02:17:44,046 --> 02:17:45,967
[SPEAKER_11]: So it gives you an idea like how old this is.

1829
02:17:46,347 --> 02:17:47,247
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, so here it is.

1830
02:17:47,267 --> 02:17:52,390
[SPEAKER_11]: We're going to take a topic and then we are each here in studio going to give our top four for that topic.

1831
02:17:52,930 --> 02:17:55,031
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, we've changed things up a little bit since last time we've done this.

1832
02:17:55,491 --> 02:17:57,252
[SPEAKER_11]: We're all going to give our top four for the topic.

1833
02:17:57,732 --> 02:18:17,749
[SPEAKER_11]: and then we will have made a list of 12 between the list of 4 that both DarkSakura, Loki and myself make then we will each go around and take one item off of the list leaving us with a list of 9 then you guys in chat will vote on the 9, your favorite and you give us your number 1 and number 2 votes and then we should have a definitive list

1834
02:18:18,680 --> 02:18:19,401
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1835
02:18:44,065 --> 02:18:55,545
[SPEAKER_11]: And Reggie Fils-Aimé asked, Well, in the same vein of Team Ninja working with Nintendo to reimagine Metroid, what development group would your readers love to see partner and collaborate with Nintendo and on what franchise?

1836
02:18:58,166 --> 02:18:59,526
[SPEAKER_11]: So, you know, let's face it.

1837
02:18:59,586 --> 02:19:04,428
[SPEAKER_11]: Metroid Other M was probably the big, big announcement out of Nintendo for us hardcore gamers.

1838
02:19:04,788 --> 02:19:07,148
[SPEAKER_11]: OMG Team Ninja working with Nintendo.

1839
02:19:07,188 --> 02:19:07,868
[SPEAKER_11]: Who would have thought?

1840
02:19:08,749 --> 02:19:14,430
[SPEAKER_11]: So, what do you think could be the next OMG developer working with a Nintendo franchise?

1841
02:19:16,090 --> 02:19:17,911
[SPEAKER_11]: That's what we're here to put the list together tonight.

1842
02:19:17,951 --> 02:19:19,551
[SPEAKER_11]: So let's start putting that list together.

1843
02:19:19,991 --> 02:19:21,732
[SPEAKER_11]: Loki, why don't you start us off this week?

1844
02:19:21,792 --> 02:19:24,012
[SPEAKER_11]: Give us your number four answer.

1845
02:19:24,512 --> 02:19:25,973
[SPEAKER_12]: Ah, number four answer.

1846
02:19:26,113 --> 02:19:26,733
[SPEAKER_12]: Let me see.

1847
02:19:28,943 --> 02:19:31,544
[SPEAKER_12]: This is kind of a joke answer, so we're going to go with that.

1848
02:19:32,244 --> 02:19:35,665
[SPEAKER_12]: Akira Yamaoka and Luigi's Mansion.

1849
02:19:37,245 --> 02:19:38,325
[SPEAKER_11]: Akira Yamaoka.

1850
02:19:38,885 --> 02:19:41,186
[SPEAKER_11]: So Team Silent or just Akira Yamaoka?

1851
02:19:41,226 --> 02:19:41,826
[SPEAKER_11]: Team Silent.

1852
02:19:41,866 --> 02:19:44,427
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, Team Silent is going to remake Luigi's Mansion.

1853
02:19:44,447 --> 02:19:45,107
[SPEAKER_11]: That's pretty awesome.

1854
02:19:45,287 --> 02:19:45,927
[SPEAKER_11]: How would that work?

1855
02:19:46,547 --> 02:19:50,868
[SPEAKER_12]: It would be extremely intense, but with Luigi.

1856
02:19:53,169 --> 02:19:54,729
[SPEAKER_12]: Would Pyramid Head make an appearance in it?

1857
02:19:54,749 --> 02:19:56,870
[SPEAKER_11]: Less whimsical, more scary, I guess.

1858
02:19:59,028 --> 02:19:59,748
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, fair enough.

1859
02:20:00,768 --> 02:20:05,510
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's see, my answer would be my number four answer tonight.

1860
02:20:05,950 --> 02:20:08,811
[SPEAKER_11]: Blizzard, the folks behind World of Warcraft, right?

1861
02:20:08,871 --> 02:20:11,891
[SPEAKER_11]: Blizzard would make an Animal Crossing game.

1862
02:20:13,112 --> 02:20:15,853
[SPEAKER_11]: So now Animal Crossing really would be an MMO.

1863
02:20:16,253 --> 02:20:18,713
[SPEAKER_11]: So Blizzard makes an Animal Crossing game.

1864
02:20:21,674 --> 02:20:24,595
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, so DarkSakura, what is your number four pick and why?

1865
02:20:24,977 --> 02:20:26,678
[SPEAKER_01]: God, mine's actually kind of related to that.

1866
02:20:26,718 --> 02:20:28,600
[SPEAKER_01]: The Sims team doing a new Animal Crossing.

1867
02:20:30,802 --> 02:20:35,525
[SPEAKER_01]: And actually, you know, make it interesting.

1868
02:20:35,686 --> 02:20:35,966
[SPEAKER_11]: Nice.

1869
02:20:36,046 --> 02:20:39,269
[SPEAKER_11]: We both had Animal Crossing answers back to back.

1870
02:20:40,270 --> 02:20:42,432
[SPEAKER_11]: Suda51 or Grasshopper Manufacturer and Wario Land

1871
02:21:09,907 --> 02:21:20,570
[SPEAKER_12]: And, you know, Suda51 is the, you know, the mind behind Killer7 and No More Heroes and just, like, the insane, crazy shit that's in those games.

1872
02:21:21,150 --> 02:21:29,473
[SPEAKER_12]: Put that in Wario Land, because, you know, WarioWare and stuff's really crazy, so it'd just be batshit crazy, just the platformer.

1873
02:21:30,333 --> 02:21:31,413
[SPEAKER_12]: That is insane.

1874
02:21:33,714 --> 02:21:35,274
[SPEAKER_11]: That is just pure insanity.

1875
02:21:35,954 --> 02:21:36,675
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, fair enough.

1876
02:21:37,235 --> 02:21:37,335
[SPEAKER_11]: Um...

1877
02:21:38,672 --> 02:21:39,733
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, you're number three.

1878
02:22:05,672 --> 02:22:10,784
[SPEAKER_01]: My number three is the Outrun team doing the next Cruisin'.

1879
02:22:12,227 --> 02:22:13,310
[SPEAKER_01]: And making that a good game.

1880
02:22:14,936 --> 02:22:17,016
[SPEAKER_12]: I haven't thought of Cruisin' for a very long time.

1881
02:22:17,036 --> 02:22:18,577
[SPEAKER_12]: I thought Cruisin' was Midway.

1882
02:22:19,857 --> 02:22:20,657
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it?

1883
02:22:21,037 --> 02:22:25,658
[SPEAKER_01]: But didn't they, no, that was with Nintendo and Rare.

1884
02:22:26,098 --> 02:22:28,738
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I think there was something, yeah, Rare had something to do with it too.

1885
02:22:28,799 --> 02:22:29,139
[SPEAKER_11]: Whatever.

1886
02:22:29,539 --> 02:22:30,239
[SPEAKER_11]: So fair enough.

1887
02:22:30,479 --> 02:22:31,299
[SPEAKER_11]: You know what, we'll let it slide.

1888
02:22:31,319 --> 02:22:31,839
[SPEAKER_11]: It doesn't even matter.

1889
02:22:32,119 --> 02:22:34,660
[SPEAKER_11]: So Outrun Team makes Cruisin' and brings that series back.

1890
02:22:34,720 --> 02:22:37,700
[SPEAKER_11]: It certainly has memories on Nintendo 64 and all that.

1891
02:22:37,760 --> 02:22:38,720
[SPEAKER_11]: So there you go.

1892
02:22:40,641 --> 02:22:41,061
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's see.

1893
02:22:42,241 --> 02:22:42,541
[SPEAKER_11]: Loki.

1894
02:22:43,652 --> 02:22:44,733
[SPEAKER_11]: We're halfway through.

1895
02:22:44,773 --> 02:22:45,273
[SPEAKER_11]: What would you say?

1896
02:22:46,795 --> 02:22:49,517
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's see if I should start doing some of my serious ones here.

1897
02:22:53,820 --> 02:22:55,482
[SPEAKER_11]: The chat room is clarifying, by the way.

1898
02:22:55,522 --> 02:22:58,624
[SPEAKER_11]: It was Midway made it, but for Nintendo.

1899
02:22:58,944 --> 02:23:02,207
[SPEAKER_11]: So it was really a Nintendo franchise that Midway made.

1900
02:23:02,227 --> 02:23:05,910
[SPEAKER_12]: Looks like... I hope I don't mispronounce this.

1901
02:23:06,571 --> 02:23:09,353
[SPEAKER_12]: Kaita Takahashi and Yoshi's Island.

1902
02:23:11,881 --> 02:23:13,782
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be hilarious.

1903
02:23:14,363 --> 02:23:18,005
[SPEAKER_12]: And Kaito Takahashi, the creator of Katamari Damacy.

1904
02:23:21,007 --> 02:23:21,887
[SPEAKER_12]: And Yoshi's Island.

1905
02:23:21,927 --> 02:23:23,128
[SPEAKER_12]: What would this game be like?

1906
02:23:23,388 --> 02:23:24,529
[SPEAKER_12]: Touch Fuzzy, Get Dizzy?

1907
02:23:25,149 --> 02:23:27,651
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, the entire game would be Touch Fuzzy, Get Dizzy.

1908
02:23:28,011 --> 02:23:28,451
[SPEAKER_11]: Nice.

1909
02:23:30,032 --> 02:23:31,513
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, let's see.

1910
02:23:31,633 --> 02:23:33,815
[SPEAKER_11]: Then we're going to get into my number two answer.

1911
02:23:35,455 --> 02:23:39,156
[SPEAKER_11]: Q Entertainment, because I'll buy practically anything Q Entertainment does.

1912
02:23:39,677 --> 02:23:52,182
[SPEAKER_11]: Remaking, and I'm kind of stretching it a little bit, kind of like the Cruisin' Answer, but Nintendo does have the rights here to Tetris on their own, and Nintendo obviously put out a lot of the big versions of Tetris.

1913
02:23:52,582 --> 02:23:58,084
[SPEAKER_11]: I think Q Entertainment should just give us a new Tetris, infused with all the music and lights and hypnotic stuff.

1914
02:23:58,104 --> 02:23:59,124
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's what I want.

1915
02:24:05,649 --> 02:24:06,710
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry for the silence.

1916
02:24:06,730 --> 02:24:08,630
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm actually typing out a list here as we go.

1917
02:24:08,690 --> 02:24:09,271
[SPEAKER_11]: So, all right.

1918
02:24:09,551 --> 02:24:12,292
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, your number two answer, please.

1919
02:24:12,512 --> 02:24:14,633
[SPEAKER_01]: The Silent Hill team doing Luigi's Mansion.

1920
02:24:15,874 --> 02:24:16,574
[SPEAKER_12]: I thought you did that.

1921
02:24:16,794 --> 02:24:17,375
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, my gosh.

1922
02:24:17,435 --> 02:24:19,055
[SPEAKER_11]: You guys both had the same one?

1923
02:24:19,095 --> 02:24:19,576
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I didn't.

1924
02:24:19,676 --> 02:24:21,116
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought you were talking about a different game.

1925
02:24:21,236 --> 02:24:21,556
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, shit.

1926
02:24:21,817 --> 02:24:22,337
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, how funny.

1927
02:24:22,517 --> 02:24:23,057
[SPEAKER_11]: That's all right.

1928
02:24:23,297 --> 02:24:24,358
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, no, no.

1929
02:24:24,458 --> 02:24:25,939
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll pick something different.

1930
02:24:26,599 --> 02:24:29,480
[SPEAKER_01]: The Silent Hill.

1931
02:24:29,760 --> 02:24:30,501
[SPEAKER_01]: No, shoot.

1932
02:24:30,541 --> 02:24:32,522
[SPEAKER_12]: I can do another one if she wants to take mine.

1933
02:24:32,542 --> 02:24:32,962
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't care.

1934
02:24:33,803 --> 02:24:35,884
[SPEAKER_01]: No, because I completely missed it.

1935
02:24:37,224 --> 02:24:42,925
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, how about the... There's lots of good ideas in chat.

1936
02:24:44,066 --> 02:24:46,766
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, but I don't listen to them.

1937
02:24:47,046 --> 02:24:53,788
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, okay, how about Square doing the next Zelda game?

1938
02:24:57,972 --> 02:24:58,672
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, fair enough.

1939
02:24:58,712 --> 02:25:05,234
[SPEAKER_11]: Zelda's a beloved franchise, but maybe it's time to turn it over and let some other people who are more experienced at it have a crack at it.

1940
02:25:05,254 --> 02:25:05,874
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, there you go.

1941
02:25:05,914 --> 02:25:07,034
[SPEAKER_11]: Square makes a Zelda game.

1942
02:25:07,494 --> 02:25:23,658
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, so so far we have Team Silent makes Luigi's Mansion, Blizzard makes Animal Crossing, Sims Team makes Animal Crossing, Suda51 makes Wario Land, Capcom makes Kid Icarus, Outrun Team makes Cruisin', Keita Takahashi makes Yoshi's Island, Q Entertainment makes Tetris, Square makes a Zelda game.

1943
02:25:24,138 --> 02:25:25,639
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's get into the number one answers.

1944
02:25:26,139 --> 02:25:27,519
[SPEAKER_11]: Loki, your number one answer, please.

1945
02:25:27,659 --> 02:25:39,154
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm sorry Rob, this is probably going to take years but Criterion Games does the next F-Zero because Burnout is fucking awesome and it just lends itself perfectly to F-Zero

1946
02:25:40,816 --> 02:26:00,297
[SPEAKER_11]: well you read my mind but Criterion Games was not who I actually thought of to take over the F-Zero franchise my number one answer is Sega, Namco, and Nintendo all team up again and finally bring us a fucking sequel to F-Zero GX and yes I phrased it just like that so Sega and Namco once again make F-Zero GX

1947
02:26:07,196 --> 02:26:09,958
[SPEAKER_11]: That's two F-Zero GXs as number one answer so far.

1948
02:26:10,018 --> 02:26:11,839
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's see if... I'm sorry, just F-Zero.

1949
02:26:11,859 --> 02:26:13,020
[SPEAKER_11]: I guess the GX wouldn't really be there.

1950
02:26:13,581 --> 02:26:16,162
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's see if DarkSakura has the same answer or something new.

1951
02:26:16,523 --> 02:26:17,003
[SPEAKER_01]: Something new.

1952
02:26:17,664 --> 02:26:19,044
[SPEAKER_01]: Treasure doing a new Kid Icarus.

1953
02:26:20,846 --> 02:26:23,047
[SPEAKER_01]: Could you imagine how hard that shit would be?

1954
02:26:26,510 --> 02:26:27,631
[SPEAKER_11]: That could be very interesting.

1955
02:26:29,272 --> 02:26:30,453
[SPEAKER_12]: Some runner-ups I had.

1956
02:26:31,433 --> 02:26:33,534
[SPEAKER_12]: Arc System Works and Smash Bros.

1957
02:26:34,535 --> 02:26:37,556
[SPEAKER_12]: Arc System Works, of course, the Guilty Gear franchise.

1958
02:26:38,197 --> 02:26:41,058
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh god, that would be crazy.

1959
02:26:41,078 --> 02:26:41,839
[SPEAKER_12]: 2D Smash Bros.

1960
02:26:41,859 --> 02:26:42,659
[SPEAKER_12]: game would be kind of cool.

1961
02:26:43,960 --> 02:26:45,401
[SPEAKER_12]: Bethesda and Zelda.

1962
02:26:50,223 --> 02:26:51,664
[SPEAKER_12]: Another one that just popped into my head.

1963
02:26:52,184 --> 02:26:55,206
[SPEAKER_12]: Kojima Productions and Battalion Wars.

1964
02:26:57,114 --> 02:26:57,834
[SPEAKER_11]: Nice.

1965
02:26:57,914 --> 02:26:58,695
[SPEAKER_11]: No Earthbound.

1966
02:26:58,755 --> 02:27:03,596
[SPEAKER_11]: I was almost going to say that Square should do the Earthbound game, but I don't know.

1967
02:27:03,676 --> 02:27:08,878
[SPEAKER_11]: Earthbound's very American, even though, yes, I realize.

1968
02:27:11,059 --> 02:27:12,540
[SPEAKER_11]: Square's very Japanese-centric.

1969
02:27:12,560 --> 02:27:14,120
[SPEAKER_11]: I just don't think it would meld well.

1970
02:27:14,140 --> 02:27:17,321
[SPEAKER_11]: I was trying to think of the perfect developer for that, but I couldn't.

1971
02:27:18,682 --> 02:27:19,122
[SPEAKER_04]: So there you go.

1972
02:27:19,847 --> 02:27:21,268
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, well guess what guys?

1973
02:27:21,428 --> 02:27:22,328
[SPEAKER_11]: Here it is, the list.

1974
02:27:22,388 --> 02:27:23,689
[SPEAKER_11]: Now we gotta go around and eliminate.

1975
02:27:23,709 --> 02:27:24,529
[SPEAKER_11]: This is gonna be hard.

1976
02:27:24,929 --> 02:27:26,170
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, so here it is so far.

1977
02:27:26,290 --> 02:27:28,471
[SPEAKER_11]: Team Silent makes Luigi's Mansion.

1978

[SPEAKER_11]: Outrun team makes Cruisin'.

02:27:40,275 --> 02:27:41,976
[SPEAKER_11]: Keita Takahashi makes Yoshi's Island.

1984
02:27:42,316 --> 02:27:43,577

[SPEAKER_11]: Criterion Games makes F-Zero.

1987
02:27:46,998 --> 02:27:48,739
[SPEAKER_11]: Sega and Namco once again make F-Zero.

1988
02:27:49,079 --> 02:27:50,320
[SPEAKER_11]: and Treasure makes Kid Icarus.

1989
02:27:50,780 --> 02:27:52,621
[SPEAKER_11]: Loki, which one of these is not worthy of the list?

1990
02:27:53,001 --> 02:27:54,262
[SPEAKER_11]: Outrun Team makes Cruisin'.

1991
02:27:55,703 --> 02:27:55,883
[SPEAKER_12]: Aww.

1992
02:27:56,844 --> 02:27:57,324
[SPEAKER_12]: Boo-hiss.

1993
02:27:57,544 --> 02:28:00,225
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm sorry, the last few Cruisin' games have really sucked.

1994
02:28:00,906 --> 02:28:02,207
[SPEAKER_11]: But this would breathe new life.

1995
02:28:02,547 --> 02:28:04,148
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know about that.

1996
02:28:04,908 --> 02:28:05,208
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright.

1997
02:28:08,110 --> 02:28:10,832
[SPEAKER_11]: I am going to take out Suda51 makes Wario Land.

1998
02:28:11,192 --> 02:28:11,872
[SPEAKER_11]: Too crazy.

1999
02:28:11,972 --> 02:28:13,413
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just too weird.

2000
02:28:13,433 --> 02:28:14,674
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't get it.

2001
02:28:16,141 --> 02:28:18,542
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, which one of these is not worthy of the list?

2002
02:28:19,542 --> 02:28:21,302
[SPEAKER_01]: Blizzard doing Animal Crossing.

2003
02:28:21,822 --> 02:28:24,003
[SPEAKER_11]: You just want yours to be the only Animal Crossing.

2004
02:28:24,063 --> 02:28:25,183
[SPEAKER_01]: No, honestly.

2005
02:28:26,584 --> 02:28:27,244
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, fair enough.

2006
02:28:27,504 --> 02:28:28,364
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, so there you go.

2007
02:28:28,624 --> 02:28:32,725
[SPEAKER_11]: Three have been eliminated from the list, leaving us with a list of nine that the chat will now vote on.

2008
02:28:32,785 --> 02:28:33,325
[SPEAKER_11]: Here it is.

2009
02:28:33,785 --> 02:28:35,686
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll get to the answers a little later in the show.

2010
02:28:35,706 --> 02:28:43,528
[SPEAKER_11]: Remember, you need to be in our chat, chat.orangeloungeradio.com, and you can place a private message to Rob Roberts in chat right now.

2011
02:28:44,028 --> 02:28:46,871
[SPEAKER_11]: with your number one and number two answers.

2012
02:28:47,331 --> 02:28:48,132
[SPEAKER_11]: So, here we go.

2013
02:28:48,833 --> 02:29:06,329
[SPEAKER_11]: Team Silent makes Luigi's Mansion, The Sims Team makes a new Animal Crossing game, Capcom makes Kid Icarus, Keita Takahashi makes Yoshi's Island, Q Entertainment makes Tetris, Square makes a Zelda game, Criterion Games makes F-Zero, Sega and Namco once again make F-Zero, or Treasure makes Kid Icarus.

2014
02:29:06,489 --> 02:29:06,810
[SPEAKER_11]: So we have...

2015
02:29:07,410 --> 02:29:24,675
[SPEAKER_11]: 2 F0s and 2 Kid Icarus is on there so we'll see how that plays out if they split the votes or what so remember you can place a vote now to Rob Roberts in the chat room with a private message and indicate your number 1 and your number 2 or it will be assumed that your first answer is your number 1 pick while we tally that up

2016
02:29:25,947 --> 02:29:27,547
[SPEAKER_11]: We're going to get into another segment here.

2017
02:29:28,068 --> 02:29:36,670
[SPEAKER_11]: We like to call the FUs of the week, but in order for our angst to build, we have to have a story that makes it worthy of us building the angst.

2018
02:29:37,750 --> 02:29:40,571
[SPEAKER_11]: And I also have to cue the music, which I was completely unprepared for tonight.

2019
02:29:41,151 --> 02:29:44,512
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not used to this new format yet where everything's in a different order in the show.

2020
02:29:45,572 --> 02:29:45,872
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyhow...

2021
02:29:47,540 --> 02:29:50,022
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2022
02:30:14,162 --> 02:30:21,245
[SPEAKER_11]: Nor could you redeem codes, including your pre-order codes for the Xbox 360 version of Ghostbusters.

2023
02:30:21,605 --> 02:30:23,686
[SPEAKER_11]: So the PlayStation 3 users got to jump on that.

2024
02:30:23,726 --> 02:30:31,470
[SPEAKER_11]: And look, all I'm going to say is if you're going to take your system down for 24 hours, it should be working by the time you bring it back up.

2025
02:30:31,550 --> 02:30:32,750
[SPEAKER_11]: Or don't bring it back up.

2026
02:30:33,391 --> 02:30:34,891
[SPEAKER_11]: So stories like this make us angry.

2027
02:30:34,971 --> 02:30:38,273
[SPEAKER_11]: So yeah, we're going to bring on the FUs of the week.

2028
02:30:54,585 --> 02:31:03,029
[SPEAKER_01]: My FU of the week goes towards sleeping for 12-13 hours because I lost most of my day.

2029
02:31:06,711 --> 02:31:17,436
[SPEAKER_12]: My FU goes to Xbox Live Marketplace because Angry Barry is still broken and I still am out 400 Microsoft points and nobody seems to be fixing anything.

2030
02:31:17,557 --> 02:31:20,218
[SPEAKER_12]: Very convenient, Microsoft, now that you have my money.

2031
02:31:24,735 --> 02:31:30,864
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, my FU of the week goes to the fact that I just told people to vote for the wrong thing.

2032
02:31:30,925 --> 02:31:31,485
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry, guys.

2033
02:31:31,546 --> 02:31:33,108
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, in chat, it's Rob Roberts, not Sky.

2034
02:31:33,128 --> 02:31:34,610
[SPEAKER_11]: Look, three people fixed it all in a row.

2035
02:31:34,931 --> 02:31:36,233
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm broken and I don't know what it is.

2036
02:31:36,934 --> 02:31:37,034
[SPEAKER_11]: Um...

2037
02:31:38,314 --> 02:31:41,236
[SPEAKER_11]: I guess I'm going to say F you to the swine flu for reals.

2038
02:31:41,816 --> 02:31:52,083
[SPEAKER_11]: I know there's been a lot of jokes and ha-has made about it, but I actually have a friend suffering from swine flu right now who's in the hospital in ICU and is really not in good shape right now.

2039
02:31:52,203 --> 02:31:57,127
[SPEAKER_11]: And a lot of us are actually kind of scared because she had to get put on dialysis this morning.

2040
02:31:57,147 --> 02:31:59,688
[SPEAKER_11]: That's how bad it's gotten because her kidneys are failing from all the meds.

2041
02:32:00,229 --> 02:32:03,831
[SPEAKER_11]: So yeah, she contracted swine flu.

2042
02:32:04,071 --> 02:32:08,114
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know where it came from, but Beth, I am thinking of you and I really want you to get better soon.

2043
02:32:08,505 --> 02:32:08,776
[SPEAKER_11]: and more.

2044
02:32:09,102 --> 02:32:14,426
[SPEAKER_11]: So, let's go ahead and move on to some more gaming news.

2045
02:32:14,706 --> 02:32:14,966
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

2046
02:32:15,286 --> 02:32:17,908
[SPEAKER_11]: While I tally the votes, my God, there's tons of people voting tonight.

2047
02:32:18,789 --> 02:32:26,774
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, of course, you would think with the Apple iPhone and the iPod Touch, you know, it's a bit limited in what you can do with games on there.

2048
02:32:27,234 --> 02:32:37,821
[SPEAKER_12]: So, of course, and this is actually being listed as one of the features with the iPhone 3.0 firmware, is that third-party accessories are going to now,

2049
02:32:39,482 --> 02:33:06,097
[SPEAKER_12]: and this is actually coming from the official iPod Touch software update page and so people are thinking oh goody we're going to get controller add-ons and so that might be actually what's going to happen because with gaming being so popular nowadays and really those touch screen controls suck I mean look at Mega Man 2 they need a new alternative so it might actually be an add-on

2050
02:33:07,970 --> 02:33:08,430
[SPEAKER_12]: So what do you think?

2051
02:33:08,450 --> 02:33:09,130
[SPEAKER_12]: Is that a good idea?

2052
02:33:09,170 --> 02:33:11,231
[SPEAKER_11]: Would you actually play with something like this?

2053
02:33:11,291 --> 02:33:20,655
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, I'm like tallying cage match votes right now, so it's hard for me to totally pay attention, but... It really, I think, would depend on how well executed it is, honestly.

2054
02:33:21,715 --> 02:33:24,816
[SPEAKER_01]: They'd really have to do something impressive.

2055
02:33:26,697 --> 02:33:27,037
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know.

2056
02:33:27,237 --> 02:33:28,458
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, I think it's kind of...

2057
02:33:29,768 --> 02:33:30,749
[SPEAKER_12]: I guess it's okay.

2058
02:33:30,909 --> 02:33:39,597
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, a lot of people are kind of bitchy about, you know, oh, I don't want to, you know, have some stupid peripheral hanging off of my, you know, iPod to play a game.

2059
02:33:39,717 --> 02:33:43,520
[SPEAKER_12]: But, you know, I guess you don't necessarily need to buy it.

2060
02:33:43,920 --> 02:33:47,483
[SPEAKER_12]: And some people are saying, hey, now they can do Guitar Hero on iPhone.

2061
02:33:48,864 --> 02:33:49,445
[SPEAKER_12]: I hope not.

2062
02:33:50,005 --> 02:33:50,826
[SPEAKER_12]: That would be scary.

2063
02:33:52,027 --> 02:33:54,129
[SPEAKER_12]: But, I don't know.

2064
02:33:56,209 --> 02:34:02,451
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I mean, the iPhone kind of needs something like that if it's really going to be like the next wave in gaming or whatever.

2065
02:34:02,611 --> 02:34:06,132
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, I don't know how seriously Apple's taking gaming right now.

2066
02:34:06,952 --> 02:34:13,795
[SPEAKER_11]: Because I've heard about this whole like premium games for the iPhone thing, which I think is silly.

2067
02:34:14,215 --> 02:34:17,276
[SPEAKER_11]: The games that are on there right now, I don't see them getting much better than that.

2068
02:34:17,556 --> 02:34:19,416
[SPEAKER_11]: Why should I pay four times as much?

2069
02:34:19,736 --> 02:34:22,717
[SPEAKER_11]: Especially when there's a lot of great indie games that are 99 cents or free.

2070
02:34:23,097 --> 02:34:23,618
[SPEAKER_11]: You know what I mean?

2071
02:34:23,878 --> 02:34:24,598
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, definitely.

2072
02:34:24,618 --> 02:34:24,698
[SPEAKER_11]: So.

2073
02:34:26,704 --> 02:34:27,024
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

2074
02:34:31,307 --> 02:34:34,230
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, I'm trying to see if there's anything going on in chat right now.

2075
02:34:34,270 --> 02:34:40,074
[SPEAKER_11]: They're still talking about the list list tonight a little bit, which I'm still trying to tally up.

2076
02:34:40,975 --> 02:34:45,198
[SPEAKER_11]: The Rob D in chat, though, says, isn't the point of the iPhone 3GS to be better for gaming?

2077
02:34:46,279 --> 02:34:47,359
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think not necessarily just gaming.

2078
02:34:47,379 --> 02:34:49,561
[SPEAKER_01]: How about to be a more efficient multimedia machine?

2079
02:34:50,001 --> 02:34:50,602
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I think.

2080
02:34:51,852 --> 02:34:52,092
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura,

2081
02:35:04,085 --> 02:35:08,686
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, well, I believe that brings us to the end of our topics tonight.

2082
02:35:08,726 --> 02:35:15,548
[SPEAKER_11]: So we're going to go ahead and open up the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

2083
02:35:15,568 --> 02:35:22,471
[SPEAKER_11]: If you want to give us a call, if you have any type of topic you want to bring up that we missed tonight, 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

2084
02:35:23,131 --> 02:35:27,132
[SPEAKER_11]: Meanwhile, do we have any last minute stories or missed rapid fires that we want to talk about?

2085
02:35:28,250 --> 02:35:30,053
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, sure, I've got some stuff I can talk about.

2086
02:35:30,473 --> 02:35:45,290
[SPEAKER_12]: Apparently, there's a rumor that Michael Jackson is involved with the new video game, and no word on exactly what that is yet, but apparently, there's something that he's working on right now.

2087
02:35:45,991 --> 02:35:46,472
[SPEAKER_12]: No, um...

2088
02:35:47,851 --> 02:35:48,972
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know.

2089
02:35:48,992 --> 02:35:53,559
[SPEAKER_12]: This is coming out of... It's actually a foreign article.

2090
02:35:54,740 --> 02:36:00,488
[SPEAKER_12]: 9lives.be is the website that has the information on it.

2091
02:36:01,910 --> 02:36:04,714
[SPEAKER_12]: It's kind of hard to determine what exactly they're talking about.

2092
02:36:05,302 --> 02:36:07,303
[SPEAKER_11]: I have gone through an official Xbox rite of passage How so?

2093
02:36:34,574 --> 02:36:35,314
[SPEAKER_09]: Red Ring of Death

2094
02:36:59,363 --> 02:36:59,923
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2095
02:37:17,602 --> 02:37:18,322
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2096
02:37:34,431 --> 02:37:34,971
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com

2097
02:38:00,416 --> 02:38:02,658
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, and you've had your Xbox for the past year.

2098
02:38:03,118 --> 02:38:08,362
[SPEAKER_11]: So, you know, that's the price you pay for having something early, I suppose.

2099
02:38:09,182 --> 02:38:16,987
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, and what was funny was that when I went to fire it up, it didn't even have the new Xbox experience so I had to download everything first.

2100
02:38:17,548 --> 02:38:18,028
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, really?

2101
02:38:18,088 --> 02:38:19,069
[SPEAKER_11]: That is kind of interesting.

2102
02:38:20,380 --> 02:38:22,925
[SPEAKER_09]: I still have one of the older consoles or something.

2103
02:38:23,365 --> 02:38:26,911
[SPEAKER_11]: Perhaps, but I don't think they're going to give you the top-of-the-line ones as a replacement.

2104
02:38:27,212 --> 02:38:28,414
[SPEAKER_11]: That's probably the hidden text.

2105
02:38:29,395 --> 02:38:32,901
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I could have asked for a different box if I wanted to, but...

2106
02:38:36,041 --> 02:38:36,882
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

2107
02:38:56,036 --> 02:38:57,537
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, because you get to keep your drive.

2108
02:38:57,557 --> 02:38:57,637
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

2109
02:39:23,796 --> 02:39:30,280
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, it seems that with Best Buy, you bring it in, you hold onto the hard drive, and they just give you a brand new console.

2110
02:39:30,920 --> 02:39:32,581
[SPEAKER_11]: I guess, but that's the same thing they do with Microsoft, too.

2111
02:39:32,621 --> 02:39:33,801
[SPEAKER_11]: I never sent my hard drive back.

2112
02:39:33,841 --> 02:39:36,643
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it's something to do about the actual serial on the Xbox 360.

2113
02:39:36,903 --> 02:39:37,183
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

2114
02:39:37,443 --> 02:39:40,585
[SPEAKER_11]: I haven't played either of those games in a long time, either, so they might have changed something.

2115
02:39:40,685 --> 02:39:45,067
[SPEAKER_11]: Because, you know, now there's Geometry Wars 2, and I couldn't tell you the last time I signed on to Xbox Live and played Joust.

2116
02:39:45,367 --> 02:39:46,088
[SPEAKER_11]: But I should do that.

2117
02:39:46,128 --> 02:39:46,908
[SPEAKER_11]: Joust is awesome.

2118
02:39:48,169 --> 02:39:48,289
[SPEAKER_11]: So...

2119
02:39:49,013 --> 02:39:56,519
[SPEAKER_09]: I should think about that, but most of the time I'm just streaming videos and stuff off my 360 from my computer because I don't like sitting here in front of the 19-inch.

2120
02:39:56,599 --> 02:39:59,301
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd rather watch it in glorious 32-inch.

2121
02:40:00,021 --> 02:40:00,742
[SPEAKER_09]: Amen to that.

2122
02:40:01,542 --> 02:40:02,423
[SPEAKER_11]: Size does matter.

2123
02:40:03,864 --> 02:40:04,665
[SPEAKER_11]: That's what she said.

2124
02:40:04,905 --> 02:40:07,147
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, Ranma, anything else before we let you go tonight?

2125
02:40:08,308 --> 02:40:08,788
[SPEAKER_11]: That's it.

2126
02:40:09,332 --> 02:40:10,713
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, you take care buddy, have a good one.

2127
02:40:11,353 --> 02:40:12,013
[SPEAKER_11]: Later.

2128
02:40:12,033 --> 02:40:15,115
[SPEAKER_11]: 877-GAME-OLR, Orange Lounge Radio on Skype.

2129
02:40:15,435 --> 02:40:18,137
[SPEAKER_11]: Listless results coming right up, but a few more last minute stories.

2130
02:40:18,357 --> 02:40:18,897
[SPEAKER_11]: Do we have any more?

2131
02:40:20,138 --> 02:40:30,023
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, actually that one thing I was talking about, the Michael Jackson game, he's supposed to be starring in his own game, so no word on exactly what that is, but it's a game that he's actually going to be the lead in.

2132
02:40:30,923 --> 02:40:34,365
[SPEAKER_11]: Quick question, chat, anyone interested in a Michael Jackson game?

2133
02:40:34,525 --> 02:40:35,005
[SPEAKER_11]: Would you buy it?

2134
02:40:36,006 --> 02:40:36,846
[SPEAKER_10]: If Sega did it.

2135
02:40:37,326 --> 02:40:38,227
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's say it's a music game.

2136
02:40:39,807 --> 02:40:40,669
[SPEAKER_11]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

2137
02:40:40,689 --> 02:40:41,010
[SPEAKER_11]: Who's this?

2138
02:40:41,772 --> 02:40:42,474
[SPEAKER_11]: Pleasure, I'm Zaku.

2139
02:40:42,694 --> 02:40:44,739
[SPEAKER_11]: Hey, Zaku, what's on your mind?

2140
02:40:44,819 --> 02:40:48,729
[SPEAKER_05]: Nothing much, just spending a rainy weekend here in New York City.

2141
02:40:49,634 --> 02:40:50,635
[SPEAKER_05]: If it's Moonwalker 2, yes.

2142
02:41:11,547 --> 02:41:13,509
[SPEAKER_05]: Boone Walker 2, Michael Jackson Boone Walker 2?

2143
02:41:13,549 --> 02:41:14,810
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, Michael Jackson's Boone Walker 2.

2144
02:41:14,850 --> 02:41:22,679
[SPEAKER_11]: You might not have heard it because you were calling in, but I asked the chatters, if Michael Jackson is really making a video game and starring in it, would you buy it?

2145
02:41:22,979 --> 02:41:29,406
[SPEAKER_05]: Will that involve, like, you know, Jesus Juice and other sexual accusations?

2146
02:41:29,446 --> 02:41:30,527
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's not go there.

2147
02:41:30,627 --> 02:41:33,110
[SPEAKER_11]: Zakud, what did you want to call in about tonight?

2148
02:41:33,775 --> 02:41:38,342
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, basically I just wanted to bring up a little gem that I managed to find this weekend.

2149
02:41:38,382 --> 02:41:42,929
[SPEAKER_05]: Apparently, I don't know if you heard, but this probably made Kotaku earlier today, but

2150
02:41:44,672 --> 02:41:49,053
[SPEAKER_05]: Apparently, these developers were making an iPhone Commodore 64 application.

2151
02:41:49,474 --> 02:41:54,415
[SPEAKER_11]: We did touch on it during Rapid Fire News and it got shut down, which stinks, doesn't it?

2152
02:41:54,955 --> 02:41:56,496
[SPEAKER_11]: What do you think about it getting shut down?

2153
02:41:57,236 --> 02:42:00,657
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I guess on one hand it's Apple's walled garden.

2154
02:42:00,857 --> 02:42:05,418
[SPEAKER_05]: You see that they pretty much control what apps make it onto their store.

2155
02:42:06,258 --> 02:42:08,659
[SPEAKER_05]: And I guess they ran afoul with the fact that

2156
02:42:09,099 --> 02:42:09,619
[SPEAKER_05]: And I can see that.

2157
02:42:09,639 --> 02:42:09,759
[SPEAKER_05]: Bigo.

2158
02:42:22,093 --> 02:42:29,556
[SPEAKER_05]: You could pretty much run any other app, any other music synthesizer, for example.

2159
02:42:29,916 --> 02:42:30,256
[SPEAKER_11]: Bingo.

2160
02:42:31,017 --> 02:42:31,577
[SPEAKER_11]: It's too much.

2161
02:42:31,657 --> 02:42:32,757
[SPEAKER_11]: It leaves it too vulnerable.

2162
02:42:33,458 --> 02:42:37,239
[SPEAKER_11]: I kind of actually understand where Apple's coming from for the model they're trying to build.

2163
02:42:37,379 --> 02:42:45,702
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess Sega basically dodged it by creating a standalone emulator hard-coded for Sonic and Golden Axe.

2164
02:42:45,742 --> 02:42:49,144
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's no way you would have been able to run an arbitrary code.

2165
02:42:49,984 --> 02:43:02,794
[SPEAKER_05]: So I guess if those C64 guys want to make their apps on the App Store, they just got to make drastic changes to the point where they have to bundle the games that they license them from.

2166
02:43:02,954 --> 02:43:06,637
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's going to be one app for The Last Ninja, one app for...

2167
02:43:12,902 --> 02:43:14,204
[SPEAKER_05]: or something like that.

2168
02:43:14,724 --> 02:43:16,687
[SPEAKER_05]: Or you could sell the other games as DLC.

2169
02:43:16,967 --> 02:43:19,129
[SPEAKER_11]: But then, you know where it's not going to work?

2170
02:43:19,810 --> 02:43:22,653
[SPEAKER_11]: Now you have to get all the original publishers involved.

2171
02:43:23,074 --> 02:43:23,594
[SPEAKER_11]: You know what I mean?

2172
02:43:24,355 --> 02:43:27,319
[SPEAKER_11]: As opposed to being able to run all your old code

2173
02:43:27,699 --> 02:43:33,361
[SPEAKER_11]: I bet I could find my old Commodore 64 floppies and the mass amounts of games I had.

2174
02:43:33,681 --> 02:43:35,881
[SPEAKER_11]: I would love to have a night.

2175
02:43:36,081 --> 02:43:39,502
[SPEAKER_11]: We seriously need to plan the time we are going to freaking do this.

2176
02:43:39,862 --> 02:43:45,664
[SPEAKER_11]: Just do some seriously hardcore old fucking school gaming on big televisions.

2177
02:43:46,064 --> 02:43:47,686
[SPEAKER_05]: well, we've got the vault

2178
02:44:01,434 --> 02:44:06,899
[SPEAKER_05]: and just like really old school consoles right there in one particular room out of six game rooms that weekend.

2179
02:44:07,180 --> 02:44:11,344
[SPEAKER_11]: I really want to figure out, maybe we could do this at a con or something, tag on to some con.

2180
02:44:11,684 --> 02:44:15,468
[SPEAKER_11]: I want to broadcast it and I want to marathon obscure classic games.

2181
02:44:15,488 --> 02:44:17,970
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't want to do like Mario Brothers and all that.

2182
02:44:17,990 --> 02:44:24,617
[SPEAKER_11]: It's some type of charity thing, but it's all obscure shit, like stuff that you may not have played before, like Impossible Mission or other Congress 64 games.

2183
02:44:24,637 --> 02:44:25,718
[SPEAKER_05]: What about that Penn & Teller game?

2184
02:44:26,599 --> 02:44:29,363
[SPEAKER_05]: That Penn & Teller game we just drive on a bus for hours.

2185
02:44:29,503 --> 02:44:30,865
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, but let's face it.

2186
02:44:31,445 --> 02:44:33,068
[SPEAKER_11]: The joke is that the game is stupid.

2187
02:44:33,809 --> 02:44:35,952
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't want to do something like that.

2188
02:44:36,492 --> 02:44:42,701
[SPEAKER_11]: Seriously, go through our own Classic Game of the Week archive and pick like 10 of those obscure games and play those.

2189
02:44:43,062 --> 02:44:43,242
[SPEAKER_11]: You know?

2190
02:44:44,042 --> 02:44:48,345
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I had my share of obscure games and I had my NES, so I pretty much have a good pig.

2191
02:44:48,825 --> 02:44:50,546
[SPEAKER_11]: Ziba says, at PAX, please.

2192
02:44:51,046 --> 02:44:56,649
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, dude, if we could get a room at PAX somehow like that, I would love that, except we're probably not big enough.

2193
02:44:56,689 --> 02:44:58,210
[SPEAKER_11]: But I never thought about it either.

2194
02:44:58,330 --> 02:45:04,554
[SPEAKER_05]: You have to start with the smaller, you have to start with the con, at the con level, since that's pretty much your domain at the moment.

2195
02:45:04,854 --> 02:45:07,616
[SPEAKER_05]: PAX is kind of like major, it's like a major indie thing.

2196
02:45:08,116 --> 02:45:10,097
[SPEAKER_05]: It's kind of like the E3 of indie games.

2197
02:45:11,477 --> 02:45:14,818
[SPEAKER_11]: I agree we need to piggyback on a con somewhere.

2198
02:45:14,878 --> 02:45:16,658
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe I need to talk to the SakAnime people.

2199
02:45:16,718 --> 02:45:17,078
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll see.

2200
02:45:17,138 --> 02:45:18,299
[SPEAKER_11]: We need to do a lock-in.

2201
02:45:19,999 --> 02:45:22,760
[SPEAKER_11]: We need to rent the Masonic Lodge for a weekend and do a lock-in.

2202
02:45:22,780 --> 02:45:23,340
[SPEAKER_11]: That would be cool.

2203
02:45:23,600 --> 02:45:26,021
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, Zaku, we're going to let you go so we can get some more calls.

2204
02:45:26,121 --> 02:45:26,501
[SPEAKER_11]: But thank you.

2205
02:45:26,521 --> 02:45:27,221
[SPEAKER_11]: You have a good one, buddy.

2206
02:45:27,984 --> 02:45:29,125
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, have a good weekend, man.

2207
02:45:44,693 --> 02:45:46,074
[SPEAKER_12]: Mega Man ZX and the EXE Universe

2208
02:46:08,110 --> 02:46:12,592
[SPEAKER_12]: And then finally, there's a new record being broken.

2209
02:46:12,752 --> 02:46:19,334
[SPEAKER_12]: The Frogger score held by fictional character George Costanda is going to be challenged, I guess, this weekend.

2210
02:46:20,535 --> 02:46:20,855
[SPEAKER_11]: Interesting.

2211
02:46:20,995 --> 02:46:21,495
[SPEAKER_11]: We got a call.

2212
02:46:21,895 --> 02:46:22,736
[SPEAKER_11]: You're on Orange Launch Radio.

2213
02:46:22,756 --> 02:46:23,116
[SPEAKER_11]: Who's this?

2214
02:46:24,036 --> 02:46:25,177
[SPEAKER_11]: This is RPGKing7.

2215
02:46:25,497 --> 02:46:26,937
[SPEAKER_11]: RPGKing7.

2216
02:46:27,217 --> 02:46:28,898
[SPEAKER_11]: Are you truly the king of RPGs?

2217
02:46:29,958 --> 02:46:31,319
[SPEAKER_11]: I like to think I'm the seventh in line.

2218
02:46:31,339 --> 02:46:32,179
[SPEAKER_08]: There are guys above me.

2219
02:46:32,579 --> 02:46:34,860
[SPEAKER_11]: Have you played this Final Fantasy IV after years?

2220
02:46:34,940 --> 02:46:36,361
[SPEAKER_11]: That's what I'm all the rage about right now.

2221
02:46:37,040 --> 02:46:37,820
[SPEAKER_08]: No, not yet.

2222
02:46:38,561 --> 02:46:40,882
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't have a Wii, so... Oh my gosh.

2223
02:46:41,302 --> 02:46:42,843
[SPEAKER_11]: You've got to figure out a way to play it, though.

2224
02:46:44,064 --> 02:46:45,725
[SPEAKER_08]: My parents have a Wii, so I'll probably get it.

2225
02:46:45,965 --> 02:46:47,005
[SPEAKER_11]: There you go.

2226
02:46:47,025 --> 02:46:54,969
[SPEAKER_11]: I know you probably called in to talk about something else, but I've got to ask you a question, because I want to talk about After Years with somebody, and you're the best thing I've got, because you're at least RPG King.

2227
02:46:55,670 --> 02:46:58,972
[SPEAKER_11]: Did you hear the story about the whole Chrono Trigger fan project getting shut down?

2228
02:47:00,052 --> 02:47:01,073
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh my god, you're reading my mind.

2229
02:47:01,113 --> 02:47:02,653
[SPEAKER_11]: That's exactly what I wanted to bring up.

2230
02:47:02,854 --> 02:47:05,295
[SPEAKER_11]: Ah, okay, then you say your thing, and then I'll say mine.

2231
02:47:06,189 --> 02:47:13,734
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I was wondering, you know, why isn't the, I was going to mention it and bring it up, that they were like practically complete, and then Square shut them down.

2232
02:47:14,014 --> 02:47:23,480
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm wondering, what do you guys think Square is being so anal about it, whereas there's like a million Mario and other fan projects, and the other publishers haven't said boo.

2233
02:47:24,158 --> 02:47:25,159
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2234
02:47:43,038 --> 02:47:43,859
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, like, even that...

2235
02:48:10,723 --> 02:48:17,005
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry, I just want to jump into that other project that was a few years ago, where they built up a 3D version of it from the ground up.

2236
02:48:18,105 --> 02:48:19,765
[SPEAKER_08]: And Square cut them off pretty early.

2237
02:48:20,205 --> 02:48:21,266
[SPEAKER_11]: That wasn't that long ago.

2238
02:48:21,306 --> 02:48:22,166
[SPEAKER_11]: I remember that, though.

2239
02:48:23,146 --> 02:48:30,708
[SPEAKER_11]: Again, I think protecting their rights, because Square's been doing all these remakes on the DS that are in 3D, so maybe they want to do something like that.

2240
02:48:30,808 --> 02:48:31,228
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

2241
02:48:32,248 --> 02:48:33,329
[SPEAKER_11]: But, yeah.

2242
02:48:34,569 --> 02:48:34,689
[SPEAKER_11]: Um...

2243
02:48:36,467 --> 02:48:42,169
[SPEAKER_11]: I think they're doing it because they don't want to shut the door on the possibility to do that stuff later on.

2244
02:48:42,950 --> 02:48:54,875
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, because I remember years and years ago they copyrighted the name Chrono Break and people were thinking, oh man, they're going to do a new Chrono Trigger, they're going to do a new Chrono Trigger, but they haven't done anything.

2245
02:48:57,831 --> 02:48:58,212
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

2246
02:48:58,592 --> 02:49:02,056
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe it's going to be the ace in the hole or whatever, but I know the fans are getting restless.

2247
02:49:02,176 --> 02:49:08,242
[SPEAKER_11]: Why are they continuing to shut down all these projects if they're not going to do anything with the Chrono Trigger franchise?

2248
02:49:08,362 --> 02:49:08,683
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

2249
02:49:09,644 --> 02:49:10,264
[SPEAKER_08]: Look at Nintendo.

2250
02:49:10,284 --> 02:49:18,173
[SPEAKER_08]: They had the whole fan project that did Mother 3 and it looks like we're never ever going to get that.

2251
02:49:19,278 --> 02:49:20,118
[SPEAKER_11]: I know, it's sad.

2252
02:49:20,559 --> 02:49:21,219
[SPEAKER_11]: It's very sad.

2253
02:49:21,359 --> 02:49:25,620
[SPEAKER_11]: And I wish we would, because EarthBound's a fun series, and they could put it on WiiWare like that.

2254
02:49:25,680 --> 02:49:28,781
[SPEAKER_11]: It would be so easy, but for whatever reason, they just don't want to do it.

2255
02:49:28,821 --> 02:49:30,562
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry, I didn't mean to cut you off.

2256
02:49:30,622 --> 02:49:32,083
[SPEAKER_08]: No, it's okay.

2257
02:49:32,163 --> 02:49:40,486
[SPEAKER_08]: I was saying that the whole DSiWare, and one of the speculations I remember hearing was that they'll put the old Game Boy and Game Boy Advance games on there.

2258
02:49:40,666 --> 02:49:42,186
[SPEAKER_08]: They put EarthBound 3 on there.

2259
02:49:42,226 --> 02:49:44,507
[SPEAKER_08]: They'll get a huge number of people buying that up.

2260
02:49:45,123 --> 02:49:53,129
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, but hopefully they're just not afraid of, like, you know, and I remember hearing an argument before that there's too much parody in there that they're worried about getting sued or something like that.

2261
02:49:53,189 --> 02:49:55,551
[SPEAKER_11]: I just, I hope they just get over that, whatever that is.

2262
02:49:56,171 --> 02:49:57,392
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a freaking video game.

2263
02:49:57,852 --> 02:49:58,593
[SPEAKER_11]: People need to get over it.

2264
02:49:59,073 --> 02:50:03,236
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, well, RPG King, we gotta let you go to get some more calls, but do you have any other final thoughts for our listeners?

2265
02:50:03,637 --> 02:50:06,219
[SPEAKER_11]: No, it's just, you know, keep the RPG love alive.

2266
02:50:06,459 --> 02:50:07,840
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, we will try our best.

2267
02:50:08,698 --> 02:50:09,058
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, thanks.

2268
02:50:09,078 --> 02:50:09,619
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, take care.

2269
02:50:10,299 --> 02:50:13,781
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, the less I play MMOs, the more I can play RPGs, so I will do my best.

2270
02:50:14,542 --> 02:50:21,666
[SPEAKER_11]: We can probably get one more call in, 1-877-GAME-OLR or Orange Launch Radio on Skype, but really, really one more call.

2271
02:50:23,067 --> 02:50:23,327
[SPEAKER_11]: Loki.

2272
02:50:24,888 --> 02:50:34,654
[SPEAKER_12]: Anyways, as I was saying, George Costanza from Seinfeld, his fictional Frogger high score is going to be challenged this weekend for whatever reason.

2273
02:50:34,694 --> 02:50:34,994
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know.

2274
02:50:36,735 --> 02:50:40,896
[SPEAKER_12]: Also, apparently Nintendo had another handheld system that they finished.

2275
02:50:41,316 --> 02:50:42,416
[SPEAKER_12]: However, they're not going to release it.

2276
02:50:43,196 --> 02:50:50,178
[SPEAKER_12]: Because, apparently, in the history of Nintendo, there are several examples of such devices like this.

2277
02:50:50,558 --> 02:50:55,719
[SPEAKER_12]: But when we are launching new hardware, the most important thing is to sustain the momentum.

2278
02:50:55,779 --> 02:50:59,480
[SPEAKER_12]: And if introducing new hardware won't do anything to do that, well...

2279
02:51:01,679 --> 02:51:02,399
[SPEAKER_11]: Let me go to the phones.

2280
02:51:02,459 --> 02:51:03,420
[SPEAKER_11]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

2281
02:51:03,440 --> 02:51:03,800
[SPEAKER_11]: Who's this?

2282
02:51:04,520 --> 02:51:05,240
[SPEAKER_11]: Hey, it's Sterlok.

2283
02:51:05,400 --> 02:51:05,961
[SPEAKER_11]: Hi, Sterlok.

2284
02:51:05,981 --> 02:51:06,881
[SPEAKER_11]: What's on your mind tonight, buddy?

2285
02:51:07,901 --> 02:51:08,381
[SPEAKER_04]: Not a whole lot.

2286
02:51:08,401 --> 02:51:09,722
[SPEAKER_04]: Didn't think you guys were doing a show tonight.

2287
02:51:10,442 --> 02:51:10,942
[SPEAKER_04]: Surprise!

2288
02:51:11,042 --> 02:51:12,063
[SPEAKER_04]: Why wouldn't we do a show tonight?

2289
02:51:13,183 --> 02:51:16,364
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought last week you said something about being back in two weeks.

2290
02:51:17,044 --> 02:51:17,444
[SPEAKER_11]: You know what?

2291
02:51:17,564 --> 02:51:19,105
[SPEAKER_11]: Our anniversary show is in two weeks.

2292
02:51:20,085 --> 02:51:22,066
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, maybe that explains our dip in listeners tonight.

2293
02:51:22,106 --> 02:51:22,406
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

2294
02:51:22,686 --> 02:51:24,927
[SPEAKER_11]: But no, our anniversary show is in two weeks.

2295
02:51:25,712 --> 02:51:27,032
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2296
02:51:50,412 --> 02:51:59,119
[SPEAKER_04]: It's kind of ironic, because he brought up Month of Three, which is, I think, one of the better RPGs ever made recently.

2297
02:52:00,561 --> 02:52:02,362
[SPEAKER_04]: But anyway, there was a fan game.

2298
02:52:04,284 --> 02:52:10,569
[SPEAKER_04]: It was kind of a prequel to Earthbound, and it's a full RPG.

2299
02:52:12,402 --> 02:52:29,547
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, it's, granted it's not a ROM pack, uh, it's a, you know, it was done in, like, RPG Maker or something, but, you know, it looks halfway decent, and, you know, it uses a bunch of music and sound effects from EarthBound, and, you know, you don't see Nintendo getting all, you know, butthurt over it.

2300
02:52:30,714 --> 02:52:32,095
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2301
02:52:53,834 --> 02:52:54,575
[SPEAKER_11]: That's what it is.

2302
02:52:55,836 --> 02:53:02,723
[SPEAKER_11]: It's no different than logging onto a Harry Potter forum and reading the stories people have invented.

2303
02:53:03,825 --> 02:53:09,370
[SPEAKER_04]: If you were going to go by Square's logic, fanfiction.net would not exist.

2304
02:53:12,033 --> 02:53:12,354
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

2305
02:53:12,414 --> 02:53:14,396
[SPEAKER_04]: It's kind of ridiculous in my opinion.

2306
02:53:15,307 --> 02:53:20,712
[SPEAKER_11]: But maybe the problem that they have at Square is the ROM hack element of it.

2307
02:53:20,752 --> 02:53:30,781
[SPEAKER_04]: But then again, I guess, you know, but they also have a 3D... But they did try to make it perfectly clear that the ROM image itself would not be included in this thing.

2308
02:53:30,821 --> 02:53:31,542
[SPEAKER_04]: It was just a patch.

2309
02:53:32,843 --> 02:53:35,626
[SPEAKER_04]: Just like the Mother 3 translation was just a patch.

2310
02:53:36,346 --> 02:53:38,949
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to attain the ROM yourself.

2311
02:53:39,389 --> 02:53:45,650
[SPEAKER_11]: But maybe it was just the whole fact that it was encouraging the altercation of an intellectual property of Square.

2312
02:53:45,710 --> 02:53:46,451
[SPEAKER_11]: Don't get me wrong.

2313
02:53:47,411 --> 02:53:50,891
[SPEAKER_11]: I think the whole thing's a little silly, and I don't think they stood to lose anything at all.

2314
02:53:51,372 --> 02:53:54,192
[SPEAKER_11]: But maybe they just don't want someone out there competing with themselves.

2315
02:53:54,292 --> 02:53:58,913
[SPEAKER_11]: Because it didn't make sense to me until I played Final Fantasy IV the after years.

2316
02:53:58,973 --> 02:54:00,273
[SPEAKER_04]: I know what you mean.

2317
02:54:00,314 --> 02:54:02,254
[SPEAKER_04]: When you brought that up, I was like, wow, shit, that's a...

2318
02:54:02,794 --> 02:54:03,574
[SPEAKER_04]: Really good point.

2319
02:54:04,115 --> 02:54:05,175
[SPEAKER_04]: I know what that is.

2320
02:54:06,216 --> 02:54:06,736
[SPEAKER_11]: Exactly.

2321
02:54:07,076 --> 02:54:07,396
[SPEAKER_11]: I know.

2322
02:54:07,516 --> 02:54:07,756
[SPEAKER_11]: I know.

2323
02:54:07,796 --> 02:54:12,579
[SPEAKER_11]: It didn't hit me until I played that, and then I was like, oh, I get the lawsuit now.

2324
02:54:13,219 --> 02:54:14,740
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

2325
02:54:15,520 --> 02:54:15,800
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

2326
02:54:15,840 --> 02:54:17,241
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, hey, thank you so much for the call.

2327
02:54:17,261 --> 02:54:20,623
[SPEAKER_11]: We're going to let you go so we can wrap up the show, but we'll see you next week.

2328
02:54:20,703 --> 02:54:22,263
[SPEAKER_11]: We will be here next week, just so you know.

2329
02:54:22,283 --> 02:54:22,924
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a big show for us.

2330
02:54:23,889 --> 02:54:24,710
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, we'll see you then.

2331
02:54:24,730 --> 02:54:25,830
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, see you.

2332
02:54:25,850 --> 02:54:26,051
[SPEAKER_11]: Later.

2333
02:54:26,811 --> 02:54:28,552
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, we're going to go ahead and close up the Skype line.

2334
02:54:28,572 --> 02:54:34,496
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks to you guys so much for calling in, but I keep cutting Loki off every time he tries to finish the story, because... And it's very rude!

2335
02:54:34,516 --> 02:54:35,156
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sorry.

2336
02:54:35,597 --> 02:54:43,542
[SPEAKER_11]: But, you know, the callers, we want them to be heard, and I don't like them being on hold for 30 minutes, because then we hear all their background noise, and some of them will start going, Hello?

2337
02:54:43,842 --> 02:54:44,222
[SPEAKER_11]: Hello?

2338
02:54:44,703 --> 02:54:47,665
[SPEAKER_11]: And you're trying to do a thing, so we try to get to them quickly.

2339
02:54:49,266 --> 02:54:49,526
[SPEAKER_12]: Alright.

2340
02:54:51,147 --> 02:54:51,347
[SPEAKER_12]: Um...

2341
02:54:53,189 --> 02:54:55,890
[SPEAKER_12]: Rock Band, Metal Track Pack Motorhead, Killed By Death

2342
02:55:19,062 --> 02:55:31,170
[SPEAKER_12]: Hawkwind, Master of the Universe, Blue Oyster Cult, TransmaniaConMC, Nazareth, Hair of the Dog Arma 2 looks awesome

2343
02:55:50,424 --> 02:55:51,225
[SPEAKER_11]: Operation Flashpoint 2 Dragon Rising

2344
02:56:11,921 --> 02:56:12,861
[SPEAKER_12]: PC, Arma 2

2345
02:56:36,668 --> 02:56:37,329
[SPEAKER_12]: which is kind of funny.

2346
02:56:37,409 --> 02:56:39,251
[SPEAKER_12]: So the game needs to be bug tested maybe a little bit.

2347
02:56:39,271 --> 02:56:40,052
[SPEAKER_11]: A little bit, but hey.

2348
02:56:40,272 --> 02:56:41,934
[SPEAKER_11]: You should post that YouTube in chat because it is really funny.

2349
02:56:41,954 --> 02:56:42,715
[SPEAKER_11]: It's pretty funny, yeah.

2350
02:56:43,256 --> 02:56:43,877
[SPEAKER_11]: So do that.

2351
02:56:44,537 --> 02:56:47,401
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry to the podcast listeners, you don't get to see that, but you can search for it on YouTube.

2352
02:56:47,421 --> 02:56:52,827
[SPEAKER_12]: Just search for Arma 2 and I'm trying to find the funny video.

2353
02:56:53,307 --> 02:56:53,788
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll find it.

2354
02:56:55,060 --> 02:56:57,922
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, since you just picked up the mic, what's your final thought tonight?

2355
02:56:57,942 --> 02:56:59,263
[SPEAKER_11]: We just got the baby potty trained in time.

2356
02:57:24,932 --> 02:57:26,352
[SPEAKER_11]: She is talking about a video game, y'all.

2357
02:57:27,493 --> 02:57:27,893
[SPEAKER_11]: Loki.

2358
02:57:28,913 --> 02:57:30,694
[SPEAKER_12]: I want to play Arma 2 once it comes out.

2359
02:57:31,914 --> 02:57:33,595
[SPEAKER_12]: And it hasn't leaked out yet, unfortunately.

2360
02:57:35,055 --> 02:57:38,396
[SPEAKER_11]: My final thought is candy.

2361
02:57:38,757 --> 02:57:39,557
[SPEAKER_11]: I want candy.

2362
02:57:39,757 --> 02:57:40,397
[SPEAKER_11]: I want sugar.

2363
02:57:40,637 --> 02:57:42,238
[SPEAKER_11]: My sweet tooth is bugging me.

2364
02:57:42,358 --> 02:57:43,458
[SPEAKER_01]: You can go get us ice cream.

2365
02:57:44,178 --> 02:57:44,278
[SPEAKER_11]: Us?

2366
02:57:44,879 --> 02:57:45,739
[SPEAKER_01]: Us, yes, us.

2367
02:57:45,999 --> 02:57:46,099
[SPEAKER_11]: Us?

2368
02:57:46,719 --> 02:57:46,819
[SPEAKER_01]: Us.

2369
02:57:47,219 --> 02:57:47,519
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

2370
02:57:48,100 --> 02:57:49,180
[SPEAKER_11]: And, oh, crap.

2371
02:57:50,148 --> 02:57:58,563
[SPEAKER_11]: The chatters are reminding me we have not done listless results I can't end the freaking show until we get the listless results God, I almost fired

2372
02:58:01,044 --> 02:58:02,085
[SPEAKER_11]: I am really out of it tonight.

2373
02:58:02,125 --> 02:58:02,685
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sorry, guys.

2374
02:58:02,705 --> 02:58:03,786
[SPEAKER_11]: I have a lot on my mind today.

2375
02:58:04,646 --> 02:58:05,867
[SPEAKER_11]: It's been a very long week for me.

2376
02:58:06,007 --> 02:58:09,410
[SPEAKER_11]: So I apologize for my amateur radio hostness.

2377
02:58:09,430 --> 02:58:11,771
[SPEAKER_11]: But then I remember I don't get paid for this shit, so deal.

2378
02:58:12,131 --> 02:58:12,432
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

2379
02:58:13,132 --> 02:58:13,512
[SPEAKER_11]: Here it is.

2380
02:58:13,632 --> 02:58:16,034
[SPEAKER_11]: The top three on tonight's list list.

2381
02:58:16,094 --> 02:58:16,454
[SPEAKER_11]: Here it is.

2382
02:58:16,634 --> 02:58:17,595
[SPEAKER_11]: Number three.

2383
02:58:18,916 --> 02:58:22,058
[SPEAKER_11]: Nintendo franchise you most want to see remade by somebody else.

2384
02:58:22,438 --> 02:58:23,299
[SPEAKER_11]: Number three answer.

2385
02:58:23,659 --> 02:58:27,922
[SPEAKER_11]: You would like to see Square make a Zelda game is the number three answer.

2386
02:58:28,002 --> 02:58:28,702
[SPEAKER_11]: There it is tonight.

2387
02:58:29,183 --> 02:58:30,524
[SPEAKER_11]: Your number two answer tonight.

2388
02:58:31,845 --> 02:58:34,687
[SPEAKER_11]: Q Entertainment makes a new Tetris game.

2389
02:58:35,307 --> 02:58:36,568
[SPEAKER_11]: You kids like your raves.

2390
02:58:36,708 --> 02:58:37,949
[SPEAKER_11]: I love this idea, by the way.

2391
02:58:37,989 --> 02:58:38,609
[SPEAKER_11]: I want it to happen.

2392
02:58:39,090 --> 02:58:42,632
[SPEAKER_11]: And the number one answer tonight for tonight's list list.

2393
02:58:43,453 --> 02:58:45,734
[SPEAKER_11]: Team Silent makes Luigi's Mansion.

2394
02:58:47,796 --> 02:58:48,396
[SPEAKER_11]: There it is.

2395
02:58:48,456 --> 02:58:49,297
[SPEAKER_11]: Your number one answer.

2396
02:58:49,337 --> 02:58:50,478
[SPEAKER_11]: That was a joke answer, too.

2397
02:58:50,498 --> 02:58:53,440
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, hey, DarkSakura had it down as a real thing, so there it is.

2398
02:58:54,100 --> 02:59:00,525
[SPEAKER_11]: That is the definitive list, so somebody contact Akira Yamaoka or the folks at Team Silent and let them know.

2399
02:59:05,502 --> 02:59:07,865
[SPEAKER_11]: The vacuum heat is strapped to Luigi's back.

2400
02:59:08,346 --> 02:59:10,708
[SPEAKER_11]: He's going back in and maybe he'll meet Pyramid Ed.

2401
02:59:13,932 --> 02:59:14,233
[SPEAKER_11]: Love it.

2402
02:59:14,813 --> 02:59:15,134
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

2403
02:59:15,354 --> 02:59:17,977
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyhow, that is really going to do it for tonight's show, guys.

2404
02:59:18,017 --> 02:59:21,361
[SPEAKER_01]: Change the name of the thing to Luigi Shed His Pants.

2405
02:59:23,393 --> 02:59:24,153
[SPEAKER_01]: Mamma Mia!

2406
02:59:25,054 --> 02:59:25,674
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my pants!

2407
02:59:42,381 --> 02:59:49,246
[SPEAKER_11]: Now that we actually have people regularly reviewing games and talking about gaming music, which is great, we're no IGN.

2408
02:59:49,267 --> 02:59:50,728
[SPEAKER_11]: We're no 1UP or GameSpot.

2409
02:59:51,388 --> 02:59:55,932
[SPEAKER_11]: But we are three friends who do this show for you guys, and your support keeps us alive.

2410
02:59:56,212 --> 03:00:00,756
[SPEAKER_11]: Please continue to tell your friends about the program and join our little family we have here at Orange Lounge Radio.

2411
03:00:00,976 --> 03:00:06,600
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll see you next week for the seven-year anniversary of Orange Lounge Radio.

2412
03:00:07,201 --> 03:00:07,881
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, my God.

2413
03:00:07,901 --> 03:00:10,523
[SPEAKER_11]: I need to make sure I can do my class earlier.

2414
03:00:11,024 --> 03:00:11,244
[SPEAKER_01]: Oof.

2415
03:00:11,817 --> 03:00:12,277
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll see you then

2416
03:00:41,222 --> 03:00:42,027
[SPEAKER_07]: See you next week!
